[16:02] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[16:04] of God that you may be able to withstand

[16:50] may be given unto me that I may open my

[17:11] faithful minister in the Lord shall make
[17:14] known to you all
[17:23] things peace be to the Brethren and love
[17:27] with Faith from God the Father and the
[17:29] Lord Jesus Christ and Grace be all with
[17:33] them Lord Jesus Christ and sincerity
[17:37] amen Amen brother
[17:51] Brian Lord bless you
[17:56] all sorry about that
[18:00] you know you could spend hours going
[18:01] scripture after scripture in the
[18:03] Ephesians the uh 6th
[18:06] chapter but being you know as coming to
[18:11] to the end of life you know God doesn't
[18:13] like men
[18:15] Pleasers one thing I've learned in life
[18:17] God doesn't like someone that's always
[18:18] sucking up to the boss or always sucking
[18:20] up to someone else or always sucking up
[18:23] to this God likes people that take the
[18:25] faith of God and stand on their own two
[18:27] feet and are willing to go forth with
[18:30] the gospel and bring about changes in
[18:33] their life their family's life and in
[18:35] their Church life I was um if you would
[18:38] go with me to Isaiah
[18:41] the 53rd
[18:45] chapter you know like brother Joe was
[18:48] praying everything we do in life is
[18:50] based on faith everything we do every
[18:54] every promise that we reach out in for
[18:57] is by faith in Jesus Christ this morning
[19:01] and like last Sunday I said how does
[19:03] that Faith come it only comes one way
[19:05] and that's by the word of God it's got
[19:08] to be continually on your lips in your
[19:10] mind and in your heart this morning the
[19:13] word of God itself is the only thing
[19:16] will bring about a change in your life
[19:18] and in the life of your family and just
[19:21] keep going adding and adding adding to
[19:23] it but I was uh we read the 53rd chapter
[19:27] brother TR read the 53rd chapter but you
[19:32] know something else I was thinking about
[19:33] this morning I was after listening to No
[19:36] numerous messages as we come at end of
[19:40] this year you know another year is
[19:41] almost over
[19:45] 2024 the world isn't getting any better
[19:47] it's only getting worse and you know I
[19:51] know that ministers in my life have come
[19:53] up year after year saying the hour is
[19:56] late the time is near there's no time to
[20:00] play church anymore no time to be
[20:03] wishy-washy about your faith and we keep
[20:06] going on another year and another year
[20:08] and another year I can only speak for
[20:10] myself but I can see in my own heart as
[20:13] I get older that's the truth we don't
[20:15] have no continuing cities here in this
[20:18] life the only hope we have this morning
[20:21] is the grace of God in Jesus Christ to
[20:24] bring you to either a Rapture or to
[20:27] Glory one way or the other that's the
[20:29] only way you're getting out of here and
[20:31] and it really when I look at the world
[20:34] the way it is this morning you know
[20:36] brother random taught numerous messages
[20:38] you know world falling apart and several
[20:41] different messages about it but I was
[20:43] just thinking of the scriptures this
[20:44] morning if you go back to Luke Mark and
[20:48] Matthew and even John where that one
[20:51] thing really strikes me where we said
[20:53] there'll be wars and rumors of wars and
[20:57] he said and he he said that's not just
[21:00] it but there will be rumors of wars and
[21:03] wars and as we look at the Earth this
[21:05] morning every continent has got some
[21:08] type of major or minor war going on this
[21:12] morning people are living and dying in
[21:14] Conflict this morning just lets us know
[21:17] that the hour and the time that we're in
[21:19] as we go into another
[21:22] year kind of got to shake off that
[21:25] complacency that comes on you in the
[21:28] sometimes got to get further in the word
[21:30] of God and get further in Jesus Christ
[21:32] this morning and I was uh there's you
[21:35] know if you were doing the
[21:37] devotionals I hadn't even read scripture
[21:39] I was reading the devotional for this
[21:42] morning and you know brother Brandon was
[21:44] talking about the thing that struck
[21:48] me in life there's two ways you can live
[21:52] your life you can have a relationship or
[21:54] you can run after things two ways you're
[21:56] either going to be one or the other
[21:58] you're always going to be running after
[22:00] things to fill up your soul and your
[22:03] person or you're going to be running
[22:05] after a relationship and that
[22:07] relationship of course is Jesus Christ
[22:09] or you going to be running after
[22:10] everything else to fill up the void in
[22:13] your life and that's the world that we
[22:15] live in this morning and he also talking
[22:18] about the church this morning it either
[22:21] glows or it shines and I believe that
[22:23] our church glows but some Churches out
[22:27] there they just shine they want all the
[22:29] shiny things but they don't want the
[22:31] relationship this morning but I I'll
[22:33] just read this 52nd chapter here this
[22:36] morning and this is what uh Isaiah had
[22:39] to say he said awake and awake and put
[22:42] on thy strength o Zion put on the
[22:45] beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the holy
[22:48] city from hence forth thou shall no more
[22:50] come into Thee the
[22:52] uncircumcised and the unclean you know
[22:55] we all want to have God's garments this
[22:58] morning on us Shake thyself from the
[23:00] dust arise and sit down oh
[23:03] Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands
[23:06] of of thy neck oh captive Daughter of
[23:09] Zion for thus sayeth the Lord ye have
[23:11] sold yourselves for not and ye shall be
[23:15] redeemed without money so they've been
[23:18] the children of Israel are no different
[23:19] than the world and the church natural
[23:22] out there this morning they they buy and
[23:24] sell themselves for the the wrong thing
[23:27] for he goes on for thus sayith the Lord
[23:29] you have sold yourself I'm rereading the
[23:32] same but the fourth verse for thus saith
[23:34] the Lord God my people went down a four
[23:37] time into Egypt and soured there and the
[23:40] Assyrians oppressed them without cause
[23:44] now therefore what have I hear sayeth
[23:46] the Lord that my people is taken away
[23:49] for not they that rule over them make
[23:52] them to how sayeth the Lord my name
[23:55] continu with every day is blaspheme
[23:59] I'm sorry for going up and down in this
[24:01] mic therefore my people shall know my
[24:03] name therefore they shall know in the
[24:06] day that I am he both do speak and
[24:09] behold it is I and I I'm getting to the
[24:13] end of the chapter a lot goes on at the
[24:15] end of this 52nd chapter how how
[24:19] beautiful upon the mountains are the
[24:21] feet of them that bringeth good tidings
[24:24] that publish peace and bring Good
[24:25] Tidings of good and publish salvation
[24:28] saith unto Zion God reth and that's no
[24:31] different today this morning and the
[24:33] Watchmen shall lift up the voice with
[24:36] the voice together they shall sing for
[24:38] they shall see eye to eye when the Lord
[24:41] shall bring again Zion and you you like
[24:44] brother Brown said you got to see
[24:45] yourself in the scriptures this morning
[24:47] Break Forth into Joy sing together you
[24:50] waste places of Jerusalem for the Lord
[24:53] hath comforted his people he hath
[24:55] redeemed Jerusalem the Lord hath made
[24:57] bear his holy arm in the eyes of all the
[25:00] nations and all the ends of the Earth
[25:02] shall see the salvation of our God and
[25:06] what I was thinking about this morning
[25:08] as you read the gospels this morning and
[25:09] you think of the church World in their
[25:12] day which would be the Pharisees the
[25:14] lawyers and the
[25:16] Sadducees the scriptures I'm reading
[25:18] this morning they could recite them for
[25:21] B they could without missing the vowel
[25:23] or a consonant they could for word for
[25:26] word they could recite these scriptures
[25:29] back to the people and yet when Christ
[25:31] was walking the face of the Earth they
[25:33] couldn't see who he really was this
[25:36] morning and we're no different ourselves
[25:38] this morning and he goes on and he
[25:41] salvation of our God depart ye depart ye
[25:44] go out from hence touch not the unclean
[25:47] thing go you out of the midst of her be
[25:50] ye clean that the bear the vessels of
[25:52] the Lord for you shall no go out with
[25:54] haste nor go out by flight for the Lord
[25:57] will go before for you and the god of
[25:59] Israel shall be your reward this and
[26:03] that's no different this morning but
[26:05] these last couple of as you read the
[26:07] 54th chapter you read these last supper
[26:10] scriptures I think to myself you you
[26:12] think of all the religious people in
[26:14] Jesus's day they they couldn't see who
[26:17] he was unless God opened their eyes and
[26:20] we're no different this morning he goes
[26:22] on to say in the 13th verse behold my
[26:25] servant shall deal prudently he shall
[26:28] exalted and be exol and be very high and
[26:31] many were astounded at his at thee his
[26:34] Visage was so Mar more than any man and
[26:38] this speaks to the cross the whole 53rd
[26:42] chapter talks about it also and what I'm
[26:44] thinking this morning is the Jewish
[26:47] people that were on the face of the
[26:48] Earth they could not see scripture
[26:50] actually being fulfilled Before Their
[26:53] Eyes in their very day and the world
[26:55] that we live in this morning is no
[26:57] different this morning morning the very
[26:59] scripture is being fulfilled in the
[27:01] world this morning and most of the world
[27:03] won't realize it until it's over and we
[27:05] don't want to be in that position so
[27:08] it's a it's a a real solemn thought that
[27:11] our very lives our very salvation hends
[27:14] on the fact that we stay firmly in the
[27:17] word of God this morning and I'll just
[27:19] finish these two verses for as many were
[27:22] stoned that his Visage was so marred
[27:24] more than any man his form more than any
[27:27] of the sons of man so the prophet is
[27:30] talking about what Christ was going to
[27:32] suffer this morning he's seen it you
[27:35] know hundreds of years before it
[27:37] actually happened and he goes on so they
[27:40] shall sprinkle many nations so shall he
[27:42] sprinkle many nations the Kings shall
[27:46] shut their mouths at him for that which
[27:48] have not been told them they shall see
[27:50] that which they have heard they shall
[27:52] consider I was going to read out of
[27:55] Colossians the uh third chapter this
[27:57] morning
[27:59] but I guess the thing I was really
[28:01] simply W as we go into another
[28:03] year as you as I think of I can only
[28:07] think of myself this
[28:09] morning anything you know as I get older
[28:12] I've said before all the things that I
[28:14] might have wanted to accomplish when I
[28:16] was in my 20s and 30s even if I
[28:19] accomplished them and I some of them I
[28:21] think I did they don't mean anything
[28:23] anymore the only thing that I've ever
[28:25] accomplished that'll ever mean anything
[28:28] is my relationship with Jesus Christ
[28:30] this morning and as we go as I go into
[28:33] another year that I know that the
[28:35] scripture tells me that that has to be
[28:38] mean more to me tomorrow than it not
[28:40] meant to me today that's the way I have
[28:43] to live my life the only thing that
[28:45] matters for me as a person or as a
[28:48] Christian is the word of God and what
[28:50] God is doing for me in my life and uh
[28:54] and I can only sa from my own life the
[28:56] last year it's it's easy to get clouded
[28:59] over with running after things that
[29:01] really don't matter but as I get older I
[29:04] realize the only thing that matters is a
[29:06] relationship with Jesus Christ and
[29:09] anything that's going to hinder that you
[29:11] just got to let it fall by the wayside
[29:13] Brother
[29:21] David love the Lord this
[29:23] morning amen let's stand if we could and

[57:47] little thought on my heart to speak we
[57:48] ask God that you'd help me to get out of
[57:51] the way Lord and use the gift of God
[57:52] lord to minister the word to the people
[57:55] that truly we could go from here Lord
[57:56] Jesus with the same testimony as those
[57:59] disciples did on their road to emus did
[58:01] not a heart burn within us as he spoke
[58:04] to us along the way thank you for still

[58:51] still in time isn't that right we're
[58:54] still in time but I believe a prophet
[58:56] taught us that we're in eternity in our
[58:58] Spirits ain't that right and even Paul
[59:01] talked about he says You observe days
[59:03] and times and seasons and all that I'm
[59:06] afraid of you at least I have bestowed
[59:07] labor upon you in vain amen but I do
[59:11] want to speak to you this morning on
[59:13] actually I want to try the take these
[59:16] two titles Amen to and tie them together
[59:19] amen the God of all Grace and we'll call
[59:21] it new beginnings new beginnings praise
[59:25] be to God amen so may God add His
[59:28] blessings to the reading of the word
[59:29] let's turn to I believe it's
[59:35] Zachariah all the way back in Zachariah
[59:37] if you
[59:40] will the first chapter Zachariah 1
[59:43] brother Brandon used this scripture to
[59:46] preach the message of Grace message of
[59:49] Grace
[59:50] amen praise be to
[59:54] God I think it was Yan's brothers that
[59:57] put together a song Amen and he they had
[1:00:00] in that song Amen the spiritual amen How
[1:00:04] does it go anymore amen and the message
[1:00:07] of Grace and Lord I Thank thee and I
[1:00:11] Just Want to Thank You Lord amen for the
[1:00:14] message of Grace praise the Lord but in
[1:00:16] Zechariah one I believe it
[1:00:20] is and no I'm not sorry I'm sorry not
[1:00:23] one but four Zechariah 4 verse one and
[1:00:27] the angel that talked with me came again
[1:00:29] and wake me as a man that wenth out of
[1:00:32] his sleep and said unto me what seest
[1:00:36] thou and I said I have looked and behold
[1:00:38] a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl
[1:00:42] upon the top of it and his seven lamps
[1:00:45] there on and the Seven pipes to the
[1:00:48] seven lamps which are upon the top
[1:00:50] thereof and the two olive trees by it
[1:00:53] amen one upon the right side of the bowl
[1:00:57] and the other on the left side of the
[1:00:58] bowl amen and I so I answered and spake
[1:01:02] to the angel to talk with me saying what
[1:01:04] are these my Lord then the angel that
[1:01:07] talked with me answered and said unto me
[1:01:09] knowest thou not what these be and I
[1:01:12] said nay my Lord and he answered and
[1:01:14] spake unto me saying this is the word of
[1:01:16] the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by
[1:01:19] might nor by power but by my spirit
[1:01:21] saeth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh
[1:01:25] great Mountain for zerubabel Thou shalt

[1:02:09] whom he may devour whom res resists
[1:02:12] steadfast in the faith knowing that the
[1:02:13] same afflictions are accomplished in
[1:02:16] your brethren that are in the world but

[1:04:30] a
[1:04:31] week some of them maybe last a
[1:04:35] month
[1:04:37] amen but the bad part is you know you

[1:05:56] Grace without having
[1:05:58] love amen when remember this when
[1:06:00] somebody's talking bad about somebody or
[1:06:02] condemning somebody for this that's not
[1:06:05] Grace that's not
[1:06:07] love no that's not compassion that's not
[1:06:11] being merciful that's being unmerciful
[1:06:15] judgmental amen and the Bible says with
[1:06:18] whatever measure you might it shall be
[1:06:20] measured to you again and the Bible says
[1:06:22] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:06:24] obtain Mercy how many believes this
[1:06:26] morning we need to be a people of Grace
[1:06:29] we need to people be a people of
[1:06:31] [Applause]
[1:06:34] Mercy amen I don't know about you but I
[1:06:37] don't want to be on the receiving end of
[1:06:39] a judgmental
[1:06:41] attitude if you don't have mercy for
[1:06:43] people God will not have mercy for you
[1:06:46] he will make it very hard that is a
[1:06:47] promise of God it's a law in the
[1:06:52] Bible hallelujah how many know this God
[1:06:54] that we've been talking about here the
[1:06:56] last couple of months that was before
[1:06:58] time amen the self-existing one the one
[1:07:01] thing that he is he is the very essence
[1:07:04] of Grace he is the very essence of
[1:07:09] love God is so full of love God is so
[1:07:12] full of grace until guess
[1:07:16] what the whole of humanity owed him a
[1:07:19] debt that they could not
[1:07:21] pay and what did he do millions of
[1:07:24] dollars were so to speak and he forgave
[1:07:26] all their
[1:07:28] debt he forgave the whole world of all
[1:07:32] of their debt he would have forgiven
[1:07:34] Cain of his
[1:07:36] debt Ain that right if he had just went
[1:07:39] and offered the lamb like his brother
[1:07:43] did see God so loved the world that if
[1:07:46] his only that he gave his only begotten
[1:07:48] son that whosoever believe with him
[1:07:49] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:07:52] life amen came to forgive every sin that
[1:07:56] was ever done how many knows that when
[1:07:58] he died on Calvary he forgave every sin
[1:08:00] that was ever committed or ever will be
[1:08:03] committed he forgave it
[1:08:06] all that is a god of
[1:08:12] Grace
[1:08:14] amen the only
[1:08:16] reason that you won't get
[1:08:19] it because you don't want it you won't
[1:08:22] accept
[1:08:23] it amen
[1:08:26] because a pardon is not a pardon unless
[1:08:29] it's received as a
[1:08:35] pardon just think about it Brad Brother
[1:08:38] Brad all of that we don't have to pay
[1:08:40] for it but if we don't accept his grace
[1:08:44] every thought that you ever had that was
[1:08:47] wrong you got to pay for

[1:09:04] going to be in
[1:09:06] Hell he's going to be in there for a
[1:09:08] very long

[1:18:03] Grace his divine grace is what saves
[1:18:07] us now oh how we
[1:18:10] know that we needed a new
[1:18:15] birth we needed a new
[1:18:20] beginning why because we had an old coat
[1:18:24] on
[1:18:25] and old Cod on the old man with his
[1:18:29] nature just couldn't get away from it no
[1:18:31] matter how many committal we made no how
[1:18:34] many leaves we
[1:18:37] turned just couldn't do it didn't have
[1:18:40] the power to do it but we needed a

[1:18:46] new amen we need a new testament with
[1:18:50] his new
[1:18:51] blood to give us a new birth
[1:18:55] by his
[1:19:00] grace read listen to that message
[1:19:02] message of Grace he says you can't
[1:19:03] bargain for it you can't make a deal
[1:19:06] with God for it no and you don't have it
[1:19:11] because you have a gift even brother
[1:19:13] Braham said of ministering or being a
[1:19:15] prophet or speaking in tongues or having
[1:19:17] faith to move Mountain that's not what
[1:19:19] gets it to you it's simply God sovereign
[1:19:24] he makes a point that it's Sovereign
[1:19:26] Grace God is a sovereign God but says he
[1:19:30] does what he wants to when he wants to
[1:19:33] he don't ask
[1:19:37] nobody you know President Biden he
[1:19:40] pardoned all of these people that did
[1:19:42] such horrible things that they were on
[1:19:44] death row fixing to be killed that
[1:19:48] right I don't even know the extent of
[1:19:51] his
[1:19:52] pardon I would hope that he just kept
[1:19:55] them from dying surely he didn't let
[1:19:57] them guys out but it'd be understandable
[1:20:00] if they did they did worse stuff than
[1:20:02] that already they let a millions of them
[1:20:05] come in here kill us huh but think about
[1:20:09] it on death
[1:20:11] row ain't nothing Trump can do ain't
[1:20:14] nothing you can do ain't nothing nobody
[1:20:16] can do how about that family that one
[1:20:19] family they didn't like it at all that
[1:20:20] their child got killed their mom got
[1:20:22] killed and their daughter and their baby
[1:20:24] got got killed and he's pardoning them
[1:20:28] but that's the power of a
[1:20:30] president that's the kind of power that
[1:20:33] he has that's pardoning
[1:20:36] power and it may be seem bad to them but
[1:20:40] when you think about you and I were
[1:20:42] deserving of death you and I were on
[1:20:44] death row and The Sovereign God pardoned
[1:20:48] you and
[1:20:52] I thank you Jesus
[1:20:55] that's Sovereign don't have to ask

[1:50:55] am I supposed to forgive my
[1:50:57] brother seven
[1:51:00] times remember this David did not have
[1:51:04] much grace on the man that took that
[1:51:06] other man's sheep and killed it and
[1:51:08] sacrific at did he when he took Beth
[1:51:10] Sheba and I believe it was Samuel was it
[1:51:13] n Samuel or Nathan Samuel came to him he
[1:51:16] says he give him the story and David
[1:51:18] said men not only will he restore but he
[1:51:21] will pay with his life
[1:51:24] he didn't have much grace for him did he
[1:51:26] Samuel says David you're the
[1:51:30] man you're the
[1:51:32] man David thought that he could get away
[1:51:35] with
[1:51:37] amen folks let me just say this as it
[1:51:39] comes you might hide it from me you
[1:51:42] might hide it from your husband or your
[1:51:45] wife nobody else might know anything
[1:51:47] about it but know this you better get it
[1:51:50] right because God knows
[1:51:53] God knows that's why our hearts has to
[1:51:56] be and our conscience has to be pure
[1:51:59] David should have known but brother B in
[1:52:02] this message called Grace he says but
[1:52:04] God had Grace on David he had mercy on
[1:52:07] him even though you pronounce that God's
[1:52:09] not going to kill you he had many
[1:52:12] troubles because of it but even then how
[1:52:15] many knows David needed a new start
[1:52:19] after his wives were raage after Absalon
[1:52:21] was dead after after all the catastrophe
[1:52:23] God restored him and that he needed to
[1:52:26] do
[1:52:29] start and so many times even we as
[1:52:32] Christians maybe you backslide maybe you
[1:52:34] get away from God and sometimes you need
[1:52:36] a new
[1:52:38] start maybe there's somebody in here
[1:52:41] this morning really needs a new
[1:52:47] start and he's the God of all
[1:52:50] Grace Peter wanted to forgive him seven
[1:52:53] times Jesus said no but seven times
[1:52:57] seven in a day if he repents you to
[1:52:59] forgive him 490 times a
[1:53:05] day I'm here to tell you sometimes
[1:53:07] people are not very forgiving of each
[1:53:09] other we're not very forgiving each
[1:53:11] other not near like God is we're not
[1:53:14] humans of all
[1:53:17] Grace we kind of reach our limits don't
[1:53:19] we then we go to fing that's enough I
[1:53:23] can't take it no
[1:53:24] more
[1:53:26] no 470 times that's how gracious God is
[1:53:31] how many times brother baham said if it
[1:53:33] wasn't for the grace of God none of us
[1:53:34] would be here that's what he even said
[1:53:38] the mistakes the prophets made the
[1:53:39] mistakes you make the mistakes that I
[1:53:42] made but one thing about this brothers
[1:53:45] and sisters as we come into this new
[1:53:46] year is we are not looking
[1:53:50] back we're not looking at our mistakes
[1:53:53] our failes and all of that we're looking
[1:53:54] at pressing towards to mark for the
[1:53:56] prize of the high calling in Jesus
[1:53:58] Christ we're pressing
[1:54:05] forward
[1:54:11] amen midlife crisis how many's heard of
[1:54:15] midlife
[1:54:19] crisis I know what a midlife crisis is
[1:54:25] absolutely something comes on you you
[1:54:27] really didn't expect didn't see it
[1:54:30] coming and it could be anything brother
[1:54:34] Troy had a crisis and sister Robin that
[1:54:36] was a crisis with that fever T what was
[1:54:42] called limes disease
[1:54:45] yes never forget it turmoil that brother
[1:54:49] Troy was in
[1:54:54] let me tell you something I pray you
[1:54:56] don't I pray that our marriage couples
[1:54:59] or marriages and everything I hope you
[1:55:00] don't have a midlife crisis let me let
[1:55:03] me just give you you married couples a
[1:55:05] little marital
[1:55:07] advice be
[1:55:09] careful after you've lived together so
[1:55:11] many years you become so
[1:55:13] common sometimes you become so
[1:55:17] common that you really kind of fall out
[1:55:20] of love with your partner
[1:55:22] a lot of people just want somebody else
[1:55:24] they just don't want to be with their
[1:55:26] maid anymore you got to watch that you
[1:55:29] got to be very careful of that
[1:55:35] amen so many divorces happen after 20 30
[1:55:39] 40
[1:55:41] years so you make
[1:55:43] sure that you rekindle if you've gotten
[1:55:46] away from it you rekindle that flame
[1:55:50] between you and your mate
[1:55:55] amen that she's special he's special
[1:55:59] what do you want honey the Bible says a
[1:56:02] husband seeks how he may please his wife
[1:56:04] his wife seeks how she may please her
[1:56:06] husband see folks as long as you're
[1:56:09] trying to be pleasing to each other and
[1:56:11] making each other happy it's a happy
[1:56:13] happy
[1:56:15] life
[1:56:18] amen but time sometimes it can be other
[1:56:21] things just other things that come
[1:56:24] along that create a
[1:56:28] crisis that you don't
[1:56:31] realize amen this church went through a
[1:56:34] midlife
[1:56:36] crisis this church
[1:56:38] experienced a midlife midlife crisis it
[1:56:42] went through the Hall of
[1:56:45] critics
[1:56:46] huh I don't I don't want to open any
[1:56:49] wounds but I'm going to give this and
[1:56:50] say this to the honor and glory of God
[1:56:52] God there's a lot of people and people's
[1:56:54] even prophesied this place would be shut
[1:56:57] down prophesied shut
[1:56:59] down at least that's what I was told
[1:57:03] hello is it shut
[1:57:05] down no we went through some real
[1:57:08] serious amen just a small
[1:57:12] group until even I
[1:57:16] become I don't know what the word would
[1:57:18] be
[1:57:20] discouraged discouraged
[1:57:23] and the Lord knows it's it's just the
[1:57:25] Lord the Lord knows how I felt the Lord
[1:57:28] knows what we was going through and the
[1:57:31] Lord turned it
[1:57:33] around the Lord did not me not anybody
[1:57:35] else it's he gets the credit for his
[1:57:37] grace he turned it
[1:57:39] around he gave us a new
[1:57:43] start and I believe that this church is
[1:57:46] stronger than
[1:57:47] ever we may not be the greatest number I
[1:57:50] don't look for numbers
[1:57:52] I look for Holy Ghost filled
[1:57:56] people I want us all at Ephesians church
[1:58:00] maybe not 15 or whatever whatever God
[1:58:02] seems to put in there but full of the
[1:58:04] Holy Ghost full of the love of God the
[1:58:07] devil and all his imps and all evil out
[1:58:10] of
[1:58:12] here
[1:58:13] God we had a new start we had a new
[1:58:20] beginning I forget how many years ago
[1:58:23] that was probably around 15 I think
[1:58:25] right around 15 years when I was here we
[1:58:27] went through that midlife and we've been
[1:58:31] here and I remember thinking this when
[1:58:35] we was going through
[1:58:38] it I felt like we were
[1:58:40] down I felt
[1:58:42] like the enemy was at 50 and we were at
[1:58:49] 14 we was way down
[1:58:52] we looked like we were
[1:58:54] defeated I felt like it was
[1:58:56] defeated but something in my
[1:59:01] heart told me that we're only at
[1:59:06] halftime this is just half
[1:59:09] [Laughter]
[1:59:11] time I'm
[1:59:13] weak I'm down we're down I'm weak but I
[1:59:19] felt like wait guess what when God gives
[1:59:21] me strength again when God gives us
[1:59:22] strength again we're going to come back
[1:59:25] and we're going to
[1:59:27] win GL how many knows that we beat the
[1:59:30] devil God defeated the devil through you
[1:59:33] and through
[1:59:34] me that's
[1:59:36] right said
[1:59:43] I people encouraging me to
[1:59:46] quit encouraging me to
[1:59:50] quit amen
[1:59:55] and I'm here to tell you
[1:59:57] something if the Lord would have spoke
[1:59:59] to my
[2:00:00] heart says you need to quit
[2:00:03] now if he' said
[2:00:05] it I'd have quit it like
[2:00:08] that I to quit but what do you do when
[2:00:12] you just have nothing in there that says
[2:00:15] you're to
[2:00:17] quit you keep going on it don't matter
[2:00:21] how down you are it doesn't matter how
[2:00:22] depressed you are doesn't matter what
[2:00:25] things look like I hope this is a lesson
[2:00:27] for us all this morning this was not on
[2:00:29] the script other than the little bit of
[2:00:32] midlife crisis but some of this I just
[2:00:34] feel led by the spirit to say it because
[2:00:37] I believe it brings honor and glory to
[2:00:38] Jesus Christ not me or anybody else but
[2:00:41] you got to do what your Holy Spirit
[2:00:43] tells you to do like brother Brian says
[2:00:44] we don't follow
[2:00:46] man just because somebody tells you
[2:00:48] something amen
[2:00:54] Amen brother Glenn I think you can take
[2:00:59] this but I'm going to say something
[2:01:01] brother Glenn said something he thought
[2:01:02] he had a special for me and Donna maybe
[2:01:04] for us to
[2:01:06] sing with this all that was
[2:01:09] happening he says and I think it was the
[2:01:11] lady that sang God don't move this
[2:01:13] mountain I may gay weaker every
[2:01:15] time me and my wife talked about it back
[2:01:17] there I says and I says honey what do
[2:01:19] you feel on
[2:01:20] that and we were like no no we're not
[2:01:25] going to sing God don't move this
[2:01:27] mountain this is one mountain we W
[2:01:30] moved amen amen we don't well welcome
[2:01:34] you know it's going to make us stronger
[2:01:36] but we don't say don't move it we going
[2:01:38] to move it it's going to have to go
[2:01:41] speak to the mountain and it'll be
[2:01:44] moveed that's why we never sang it
[2:01:46] brother Glenn didn't have the feeling on
[2:01:48] it amen
[2:01:53] sister Becky same way with the book I
[2:01:54] hope you don't mind brought a book about
[2:01:57] people who have diagnosed with cancer
[2:01:59] diagnosed with cancer and it was no
[2:02:00] doubt a book of healing and positive but
