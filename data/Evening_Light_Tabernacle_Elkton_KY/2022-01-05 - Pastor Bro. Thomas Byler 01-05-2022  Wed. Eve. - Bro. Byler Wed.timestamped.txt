[3:41] it's nice when the light turns screen
[3:43] when you switch it over
[3:45] amen
[3:46] all right now where was we so let's turn
[3:48] our bibles to ephesians let's go to the
[3:50] book of ephesians
[3:54] amen
[3:59] i don't know about you but i have really
[4:02] enjoyed
[4:03] the series the lord has laid on my heart
[4:06] and
[4:07] really
[4:08] it's
[4:09] you know i heard even brother branham
[4:11] say you know the purpose of us coming
[4:13] together even
[4:14] is to bring up
[4:17] honor and glory and glorify
[4:20] him right
[4:22] and so that's really what it's all about
[4:23] it's not so much about us as it is
[4:26] glorifying who he is because without him
[4:40] we we'll begin with verse
[4:44] 18.
[4:51] the eyes of your understanding being
[4:53] enlightened
[4:55] that you may know what is the hope of
[4:57] his calling
[4:58] and what the riches of the glory of his
[5:00] inheritance in the saints
[5:05] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[5:07] his power to us were who believe
[5:11] according to the working of his mighty
[5:14] power
[5:15] which he wrought in christ
[5:18] when he raised him from the dead and set
[5:20] him at his own right in heaven right
[5:22] hand in heavenly places
[5:24] far above all principality and power and
[5:28] might and dominion and every name that
[5:31] is named
[5:32] not only in this world but also that
[5:34] which is to come and has put everything
[5:35] under his feet and gave him to be the
[5:37] head over all things in the church with
[5:39] his body the fullness of him that
[5:41] filleth all in
[5:44] all amen may god has blessings to
[5:46] reading the word you can be seated
[5:49] this evening
[5:51] amen
[5:58] if you want to listen to a good message
[6:02] listen to god's provided place of
[6:04] worship
[6:06] 1965.
[6:08] amen
[6:10] brother branham talked and he went over
[6:13] into the old testament into the book of
[6:14] deuteronomy the 16th chapter and one of
[6:17] the last scriptures
[6:19] reads like this
[6:20] thou mayest not sacrifice the passover
[6:23] with any and any gate which the lord thy
[6:25] god giveth thee but at the place which
[6:28] the lord thy god shall choose to place
[6:31] his name in
[6:33] there thou shalt sacrifice the passover
[6:35] at evening and the golden of the sun
[6:38] at the season that thou come us forth
[6:41] out of egypt amen
[6:43] so we know that god had a a name he had
[6:47] a place
[6:48] a place that he chose to put his name
[6:51] and that is the place
[6:53] that the sacrificer was supposed to meet
[6:55] god amen
[6:58] and
[6:59] also this evening i want to talk about
[7:01] something we've heard quite a bit but i
[7:02] want to just look at it again because to
[7:05] me it's one of the greatest mysteries
[7:09] or the great revelations
[7:11] of this hour amen
[7:14] and it's an absolute blessing it's it is
[7:18] uh
[7:19] well
[7:20] reading what paul said he was just kind
[7:23] of expressing it
[7:24] and he says what is the exceeding great
[7:27] greatness of his power to us words
[7:30] your eyes being under under
[7:32] uh the eyes of your understanding being
[7:35] enlightened
[7:36] that you may know what is the hope
[7:38] of his calling
[7:41] amen
[7:43] so i just want to start out with saying
[7:45] we are privileged people
[7:47] we are privileged people you're a
[7:48] privileged person
[7:50] amen
[7:51] as long as he's
[7:53] on the throne
[7:55] sitting there making an intersection
[7:57] intercession you're a privileged person
[7:59] amen
[8:00] now we want to talk about the name and
[8:02] how many knows what the name of god is
[8:04] the lord jesus christ right
[8:06] that is the name
[8:08] amen and that's the that's the that's
[8:10] the that's the place amen that we want
[8:12] to focus on
[8:14] we know there is power
[8:16] in the name i like that song i'm not
[8:18] sure who's saying this but there's power
[8:20] in the name of jesus amen
[8:23] just that name
[8:26] amen
[8:30] is the sweetest name i know
[8:32] is jesus christ
[8:36] now we know that here this scripture
[8:38] talks about that he has a name
[8:41] and uh listen and dominion and every
[8:44] name that his name his name is above
[8:46] every he's not got the highest name
[8:49] but we know that he had taken what the
[8:50] lowest name
[8:52] which was
[8:55] the al-zibah
[8:58] does somebody know what beelzebub means
[9:02] now i don't know if it's the meaning of
[9:04] it
[9:05] or if
[9:06] perhaps beelzebub is supposed to be
[9:10] the chief of devils right
[9:12] in other words the chief of devils
[9:16] he took the name of the chief of devils
[9:20] wow
[9:21] took the lowest name that could be named
[9:25] and god gave him the highest name that
[9:28] that there is there is no higher name
[9:34] you know we think of great men we think
[9:36] of many different great men abraham
[9:38] lincoln george washington you know we
[9:40] think of different ones perhaps but they
[9:41] don't even compare close to the name of
[9:43] jesus christ
[9:48] amen
[9:53] amen praise the lord you love him
[9:57] no all right
[10:08] yes
[10:09] let me see here
[10:14] clock
[10:16] actions
[10:17] it's three if you want to go with me to
[10:19] collection
[10:20] three
[10:40] colossians 3
[10:44] it says whatsoever
[10:47] you do
[10:48] in word
[10:50] or indeed do all in the name of the lord
[10:53] jesus
[10:55] giving thanks to god the father by him
[10:57] so
[10:58] our actions every word everything that
[11:00] we say everything that we do is supposed
[11:03] to be done in the name of jesus christ
[11:07] amen
[11:08] whatever use in word whether it's a word
[11:10] or deed do everything in the name of
[11:12] jesus christ
[11:14] no other name that's the greatest name
[11:16] of all names
[11:18] amen
[11:21] uh just just rehearsing a scripture
[11:24] talks about going into all the world
[11:28] the gospel amen
[11:31] and it has to be done in his name
[11:34] in luke i believe it is
[11:36] that repentance and remissions of sin
[11:39] should be preached in his name beginning
[11:41] at jerusalem
[11:44] it had to be in his name because that's
[11:46] where
[11:47] the respect lies that's where honor lies
[11:52] i mean like we sang earlier talking
[11:54] about there's no other hope there's no
[11:56] other peace but in christ jesus
[11:59] none there's not nowhere else you can go
[12:02] there's no avenue there's no door to
[12:05] heaven
[12:06] amen we get buried with him by baptism i
[12:09] mean those we get buried by baptism in
[12:12] the name of jesus christ
[12:14] there's not another name given
[12:17] i was reading in this listening to this
[12:19] tape brother branham and i have thought
[12:20] about the i thought about the story but
[12:22] i didn't know brother madam actually
[12:24] said it in that date where he talked
[12:25] about how that he says you know there's
[12:28] a lot of fake
[12:30] uh
[12:30] people that claim to be spiritualists
[12:33] and so forth and he says but there's
[12:35] also some real ones out there because
[12:37] he's come in contact with them in
[12:39] foreign fields he said there were some
[12:41] people some some people that were devil
[12:44] worshippers and possessing the devil and
[12:46] so forth that would brought a table
[12:48] and it was suspending and it was doing
[12:50] some stuff i didn't go into detail of
[12:52] what it was doing what was going on
[12:53] there and they challenged he says you
[12:55] know if you got power bring it down and
[12:57] he said some guys jumped on the legs and
[12:59] were hanging onto the legs and that
[13:01] table flung them to the side
[13:04] they couldn't bring it down and then
[13:06] they said now you claim to be a a
[13:08] preacher and so forth what power do you
[13:10] have if you've got power to bring it
[13:11] down these thieves says i got no power
[13:15] but he represented one
[13:17] and he began to talk about how that he
[13:19] uh uh you know he said in the name of
[13:21] the father the son and the holy ghost
[13:23] come down
[13:25] huh
[13:26] it just goes to show that people that
[13:28] use that there's no more power in it
[13:32] there's no power why not
[13:34] not in this tape not in this place i
[13:36] believe it was but in one of them and
[13:38] that he said you know he used his titles
[13:40] and then he used uh his own name william
[13:43] branham he didn't go nowhere
[13:46] but he says then and they said in the
[13:47] name of jesus christ come down
[13:50] amen and their legs like come off
[13:53] [Music]
[13:55] i know wouldn't you like to have seen
[13:56] that
[13:57] i can only imagine in my mind where it
[13:59] just come down because why
[14:01] that's where power lays
[14:04] how many knows that's what the gospel
[14:06] paul said you know the gospel don't come
[14:09] in word only but it comes in
[14:13] come on
[14:14] church power and demonstration of the
[14:18] holy ghost
[14:21] we're living in the age folks when uh
[14:24] they'll be lovers of pleasure more than
[14:26] lovers of god had a high minded having a
[14:29] form
[14:30] they have christianity formed they go to
[14:33] church
[14:35] huh
[14:37] they have a christian form but they deny
[14:40] the power thereof
[14:43] one place paul said you know some of
[14:45] these people that are causing trouble in
[14:46] the church and so forth i'm not going to
[14:48] worry about their words but i'm going to
[14:50] check their power
[14:51] because by me knows paul is the one that
[14:53] god stood behind he had the power
[14:57] oh my when we think about it there's
[14:59] power in that name
[15:02] how many knows that man many times
[15:04] you've heard of testimonies of people
[15:05] being in a car crash or almost getting
[15:07] killed and they'll just whisper that
[15:09] name jesus
[15:11] and he turns the whole thing
[15:14] amen that's that's the greatest name you
[15:16] can mention because he's right there
[15:20] oh my
[15:22] there's power in the name of jesus
[15:23] christ
[15:26] amen
[15:27] oh my i'm so i'm so happy for that
[15:31] oh my think about it there's power
[15:34] in the name of jesus christ
[15:36] in john 12
[15:39] saint john 14 and verse
[15:43] 12 says verily very i say unto you he
[15:45] that believeth on me the works that i do
[15:48] shall he do also and greater works than
[15:50] thee should shall you do because i go
[15:52] unto my father he says and whatsoever ye
[15:56] shall ask in my name that will i
[15:59] do
[16:01] now notice he says in my name
[16:04] how many beliefs you gotta use the right
[16:06] name
[16:08] you got to be in the right place
[16:11] and you've got to be oh my
[16:14] whatever you shall ask in my name that
[16:16] will i do that the father may be
[16:17] glorified in the son and if ye ask
[16:21] if you ask anything in my name
[16:25] i will do it
[16:28] praise the lord
[16:30] now how many knows that this was only
[16:32] made available
[16:34] and i i keep i keep going back to a
[16:37] little revelation that the lord gave me
[16:38] a couple weeks ago
[16:40] and that revelation is that
[16:43] jesus paid the price
[16:46] for this earth
[16:48] he already bought it
[16:50] huh
[16:52] how many does it's already paid for
[16:54] the earth is already paid for
[16:58] the only thing he has to do
[17:01] is claim what he has purchased
[17:03] we're waiting on him to come and make
[17:05] his claim
[17:06] [Applause]
[17:07] right
[17:09] wouldn't it be nice if if the rapture
[17:11] takes place whenever that rapture takes
[17:13] place he takes us out of here
[17:15] he makes a partial claim but he don't
[17:17] rent it he don't come until the day of
[17:19] the lord comes
[17:20] right and he begins to burn everybody
[17:23] destroy everybody burn everything wicked
[17:26] that's when he claimed and he's going to
[17:27] come cleanse it for himself
[17:31] but he's waited 2 000 years and not
[17:33] claimed it because why
[17:35] because he's got a work that he's doing
[17:38] and that work is what that work is
[17:40] redeeming you and me
[17:44] and that revelation to me was just not
[17:46] only and then it got into my mind about
[17:49] how that the prophet of god
[17:52] and what he said
[17:53] about what happened at calvary
[17:57] what jesus did and why this name is so
[17:59] powerful
[18:01] i'm going to read it again something
[18:02] we've heard a lot in this message but i
[18:04] want to say it again
[18:09] that whenever whenever jesus christ paid
[18:12] the price
[18:14] whenever he died and whenever he rose
[18:17] again and sat at the right hand of god
[18:20] he went up above every dominion above
[18:23] every notice he didn't he didn't claim
[18:25] not to be over anything
[18:28] right he claimed to be over everything
[18:30] every principality every power
[18:33] right
[18:35] there's nothing that is under his feet
[18:37] now
[18:39] and brother bennett makes the statement
[18:42] now satan don't have one right to
[18:45] nothing
[18:47] let me believe that the devil lost all
[18:49] his rights
[18:54] he did
[18:57] oh let me just say it while i got my
[18:59] mind and the only way that you can rob
[19:01] the devil of his rights is to come into
[19:03] that blood is to come into jesus christ
[19:06] if you don't come under that blood
[19:09] if you don't get washed by the blood if
[19:11] you don't get cleaned by the blood the
[19:13] devil still has a right on you
[19:15] not right remember that one woman that
[19:17] wanted to have prayer and so forth and
[19:20] and she was very nervous for years and
[19:22] years and years and years and she was
[19:24] got finally in brother byron's presence
[19:26] and so forth and the discernment says
[19:28] look when you were many years ago you
[19:30] had an affair
[19:32] with a woman and you and another woman
[19:34] you've had absolutely well nowadays
[19:36] you'd be a woman but you've had an
[19:38] affair with a man
[19:40] right and you've never made that right
[19:43] and so he says no matter how many
[19:45] gallons of oil you pour on them no
[19:46] matter how many preachers pray for him
[19:48] that devil has the right to be there
[19:50] because she's still not under the blood
[19:53] she's still not in christ that's the
[19:55] only way he has a right
[19:57] but it's only in christ and the prize
[20:00] has been paid the job has been done so
[20:02] to speak the work has been finished
[20:06] i mean now the work that it took
[20:08] to give us access and bring us back in
[20:11] the sons of god again that work has been
[20:13] finished
[20:14] it's done
[20:15] the devil has been stripped of every
[20:17] right that he had he has no more legal
[20:19] rights anymore
[20:21] oh thank god
[20:23] he's only a bluff
[20:27] amen
[20:28] only of love
[20:30] he was stripped of everything at calvary
[20:34] when jesus christ take this inner place
[20:36] and die to calvary satan has
[20:39] no legal rights over nothing no more
[20:43] but everything lays in the hands of the
[20:46] church and the believer
[20:48] satan has lost he's got nothing but a
[20:51] bluff even death itself
[20:53] amen like we have taught
[20:56] has lost its stinger
[20:58] like the bee
[21:00] when it stoned christ the bee
[21:03] the bee stinger stayed in him
[21:05] and he pulled that singer out
[21:08] hey there will be lands on you oh my get
[21:11] off me huh right
[21:14] but you listen you know if you could
[21:17] know that that bee doesn't have a
[21:18] stinger you can say hey birdy little bee
[21:21] how you doing
[21:23] wouldn't be afraid of at all would you
[21:25] but if you thought it could sting you
[21:27] you'd be worried about it
[21:28] well that's what the devil is he is a
[21:31] bee without a stinger poor thing no
[21:34] matter how much it buzzes and hums and
[21:36] how it looks it has no power
[21:41] amen praise be to god
[21:44] it lost its stinger death has no sting
[21:47] to the believer just like paul said o
[21:49] death where is your sting oh grave where
[21:52] is your victory but i have the victory
[21:54] through jesus christ our lord
[21:58] amen how many is bad for that that you
[22:00] don't have to be afraid of death anymore
[22:03] you don't have to be afraid to die
[22:06] why do you know the one that rose
[22:10] i mean you don't have to be afraid of
[22:11] the tribulation you have nothing to be
[22:12] scared of
[22:16] amen
[22:18] all right
[22:20] if i don't go any faster we may be here
[22:22] until 9 9 30.
[22:25] because i want to talk about how we can
[22:26] end that name i mean you got to be in
[22:28] that name
[22:30] in the name
[22:32] in the name of jesus in the name of
[22:35] jesus
[22:36] we have the victory
[22:39] but you got to be in
[22:40] jesus says if you abide in me and my
[22:42] words abide in you you can ask what you
[22:45] will
[22:47] and it'll be done
[22:50] how many knows that is that is
[22:52] bigger than perhaps our mind can
[22:53] comprehend tonight
[22:56] he said whatever you ask in my name i
[23:00] will
[23:01] do it
[23:02] wow whatever you ask
[23:05] i will
[23:06] do it it's a promise
[23:12] let me finish this and then i want to go
[23:13] to talking about how god has promised
[23:16] and said that
[23:17] since calorie now he hands the power
[23:22] to his children
[23:24] to become
[23:25] sons and daughters of god
[23:28] here not long ago
[23:30] right after he says this about death and
[23:32] the singer we was at
[23:34] walking to the grave of billy paul's
[23:36] mother mother
[23:38] he was just a little lad that morning
[23:39] before daylight he was walking down to
[23:42] put a flower on her grave and i took off
[23:44] my hat he took off his little old hat
[23:47] we walked down there and his little
[23:49] mother and sister laid in the grave
[23:51] we said upon the flowers down and the
[23:53] little fellow with his hat in his hand
[23:55] stood with his head bowed
[23:57] i felt
[24:00] down as just
[24:02] as the sun begin to i knelt down just as
[24:05] sun began to break daylight
[24:07] he started to cry i put my arm around
[24:09] him and said sonny look
[24:11] but in glory
[24:12] they wait our coming
[24:15] i said grave you can't hold them far
[24:18] beyond that rising under i can point
[24:21] you to an empty tomb this morning
[24:24] where one rose up from the grave and
[24:26] robbed satan of everything that he had
[24:33] amen i believe that
[24:35] i'm going to say it again it's no fault
[24:37] of god's it's going to be on the human
[24:39] being's fault now
[24:44] it's on us if thou can't believe
[24:48] all things are possible if you can get
[24:50] to the place that you can believe
[24:53] all right
[24:54] where one rose from the grave rob saving
[24:56] of everything he had and they were in
[24:58] him in other words mom and big tile were
[25:01] in him when they left here they've got
[25:03] to come forth just the same as he come
[25:05] forth
[25:06] god gave to promise heavens
[25:09] and earth will pass but his word cannot
[25:12] fail
[25:13] the hopes is built on nothing less than
[25:15] jesus blood and righteousness
[25:18] brother when you get encouraged enough
[25:20] to step out toe to toe to line with the
[25:23] devil and scat him off
[25:26] i believe that no matter what the devil
[25:29] does you've got a right now to get up to
[25:31] the devil and say you get off my
[25:33] property
[25:36] you make me miserable you give me a hard
[25:38] time but you ain't got no right
[25:42] just remind him i don't want you to
[25:43] remember that jesus defeated you with
[25:46] calvary you have got you you poor fella
[25:48] you've got all your rights taken away
[25:49] from you
[25:52] oh now notice then he says if i went to
[25:54] my house tonight and i got a legal deed
[25:56] from my house if i went there
[25:58] and someone was laying there drinking
[26:00] and carrying on and doing wrong i'd say
[26:02] get out of here friend
[26:04] well this is a house for human beings
[26:06] i've got a right to be here
[26:08] i would say you do not i possess this
[26:11] house it's mine he'd say well i got it
[26:13] right
[26:14] just like sickness enter the body or sin
[26:18] or whatever it is
[26:20] say well the other ones drink and the
[26:23] others do this and others be this way
[26:25] but he has no legal rights
[26:27] i could go down with my abstract need
[26:29] and go down to the court and say look
[26:30] here someone has moved in here and
[26:32] doesn't belong there this is mine that
[26:33] belongs to me the law would come up and
[26:36] put them out
[26:38] because i've got the abstract written
[26:41] deed to that property
[26:44] right brother and sister we have an
[26:46] abstract
[26:47] written deed tonight to salvation and
[26:49] divine healing the devil has no rights
[26:52] trust god and the holy spirit to put him
[26:55] out
[26:56] that's right that's all say amen oh i
[26:58] feel religious that's right
[27:00] so he's got absolutely no
[27:02] right because of the blood
[27:05] we have an abstract deed what is that
[27:07] abstract need
[27:09] that abstract title deed is nothing less
[27:13] than the holy ghost
[27:14] how many knows the holy ghost is the
[27:16] earnest of our salvation
[27:18] it's the earnest money it's what gives
[27:20] you a right over the devil
[27:23] amen but there's no other way
[27:25] now let's turn if you will acts 1
[27:30] and uh acts 1
[27:32] 7 7-8
[27:35] let's go to 6. and when when they
[27:37] therefore will come together they ask
[27:40] ask of him saying lord with thou at this
[27:42] time again restore unto us again the
[27:45] kingdom of israel
[27:46] and he said unto them it is not for you
[27:49] to know the times or the seasons which
[27:51] the father has put in his own power
[27:54] but ye shall receive power after that
[27:58] the holy ghost has come upon you
[28:00] amen
[28:02] and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
[28:05] in jerusalem and in judea and into the
[28:07] other most parts of the earth
[28:11] amen
[28:17] now in
[28:18] saint john i believe it is
[28:20] saint john 1.
[28:25] saint john 1 and 12 it says it this way
[28:32] listen he came to his own and his own
[28:35] received him not but as many as received
[28:38] him to them gave he
[28:40] power
[28:42] to become sons of
[28:45] god even to them
[28:47] that believe on what
[28:50] his name
[28:51] how many knows you can never become a
[28:54] son through
[28:55] any other religion no other name
[28:57] muhammad buddha i don't care what the
[28:59] name is you'll never become a son or
[29:02] daughter of god except through that name
[29:07] oh my
[29:09] how many thankful for that power
[29:11] you know there's a there is power in the
[29:13] name i absolutely know it is
[29:16] but there's let's just talk about the
[29:18] devil's power there's different powers
[29:20] and listen you might not think so but i
[29:23] truly believe that the holy spirit
[29:27] literally
[29:28] gives power to your physical body
[29:32] how many believes that sure
[29:35] let's take an example
[29:38] for one thing
[29:40] whenever the whenever the holy ghost
[29:42] burns in here real hard
[29:45] it causes you to love
[29:47] right
[29:49] it makes you love everybody
[29:51] it puts a smile on for it brings joy in
[29:53] your life it's power
[29:55] power to overcome
[29:57] just like
[30:00] cain
[30:04] when he was offering his fruits and his
[30:06] gifts and everything on the altar and
[30:09] he would have never imagined i don't
[30:11] imagine cain would have ever imagined
[30:13] that he'd take a rock and
[30:16] cave somebody's head in
[30:17] [Music]
[30:19] right
[30:20] i mean he was worshiping the lord he
[30:22] never thought he'd do something back but
[30:24] let what come on when jealousy come on
[30:27] him
[30:28] how many know there is a power in
[30:31] jealousy
[30:33] it's a wicked power
[30:35] it's an evil power
[30:38] you take a man or you know uh take a uh
[30:41] take a woman perhaps or a man cheating
[30:43] on on somebody you know and there's such
[30:46] jealousy or such hatred and such anger
[30:49] until you almost blow somebody's head
[30:52] off
[30:53] you'd have to refrain yourself if you
[30:55] let that hatred and that jealousy get on
[30:57] you too much
[30:59] there's no telling how wicked you'd be
[31:01] because the power of that hatred the
[31:03] power of that jealousy
[31:06] to where otherwise
[31:08] you're a very kind nice person perhaps
[31:11] huh
[31:12] there's evil powers but then there's
[31:14] good power
[31:16] amen i like that jesus said you'll
[31:18] receive power after the holy ghost
[31:21] oh my i mean they couldn't even stand
[31:24] for jesus
[31:26] his disciples man will stand for you
[31:28] peter says i'll die for
[31:30] you big old strong people i will die for
[31:34] you jesus says
[31:37] wait till you get converted all right
[31:38] that's what you need is a good
[31:40] conversion
[31:41] before the crows you'll deny me
[31:43] three times
[31:45] peter would have never thought it but
[31:46] when the pressure came and the right he
[31:48] didn't have the power that he needed
[31:50] right
[31:51] he didn't have the power that he needed
[31:53] but after the pentecost when the holy
[31:55] ghost power came down and then he was
[31:58] willing to when they were taking him to
[32:00] be crucified from what i understand and
[32:02] then he said don't let don't let that
[32:04] curiosity fire me up
[32:06] upright like you did here and i'm not
[32:07] worthy
[32:09] crucify me upside down
[32:14] think that's the way he went
[32:16] huh
[32:17] think about it
[32:19] power
[32:21] to walk into there
[32:23] to walk to death
[32:25] that's what we need how many believes
[32:26] that's what we need
[32:28] how many tonight would say that's what i
[32:30] need brother i need more of that holy
[32:31] ghost power i need more of the power
[32:35] that is in that name
[32:38] amen what the bible say god is rich to
[32:41] all who call upon his name
[32:46] that's oh it's it's the name of all
[32:50] names
[32:53] jesus
[32:54] jesus jesus there's just something
[32:59] about that name
[33:01] master savior jesus
[33:04] like the fragrance after
[33:06] a rain
[33:09] oh my
[33:10] you can get all backslid you can get
[33:12] cold on god and so forth and you realize
[33:14] that when you repent genuine repentance
[33:20] folks let me tell you something got
[33:21] something else the lord showed me here
[33:23] in the last couple days we got too many
[33:24] dried-eyed confessions
[33:28] people come and confess but they're not
[33:29] really sorry for their sin at all
[33:33] they don't feel so bad that they weep
[33:35] and cry and say god how could i do that
[33:38] lord forgive me a real godly sorrow
[33:42] huh
[33:44] get more places if you'd have that
[33:46] tender of a heart to where you're really
[33:48] sorry for your sins
[33:50] dry eye confessions we don't need them
[33:52] you don't get very far you got to be
[33:54] very serious about it you got to realize
[33:55] how terrible your sin is
[33:58] amen
[33:59] but i like that he gave them power to
[34:02] become
[34:03] sons of god
[34:05] amen
[34:08] notice jesus said in matthew 18 he says
[34:10] wherever two or three
[34:13] are gathered
[34:16] in my name
[34:21] there i will be
[34:23] in their midst i mean believe that
[34:27] all it takes
[34:28] is a couple people
[34:30] filled with the holy ghost
[34:33] amen
[34:34] and i believe it's under that same
[34:35] scripture i won't go there but i believe
[34:36] it's there also where he says and
[34:38] whatever two or three agree on anything
[34:42] i will do it
[34:45] that the father may be glorified in
[34:47] other words when to ask anything say god
[34:49] we do this
[34:51] but you got to pee in his name you got
[34:53] to do it in
[34:54] his name
[34:56] oh my
[34:58] power to become
[35:01] sons of god
[35:03] amen
[35:04] power to become in other words authority
[35:08] how many knows that you're got the
[35:10] authority now to become a son and
[35:13] daughter of god but you're going to use
[35:15] that authority
[35:17] you've got to use that power
[35:21] what is that authority what is that
[35:23] power
[35:24] how do you use it
[35:27] to believe that jesus died for you
[35:31] you say god for god so love
[35:34] not the world
[35:38] but for god so loved me that he gave his
[35:41] only begotten son that if i would
[35:45] believe in him i should never perish
[35:49] there's power and there's deliverance in
[35:51] that name
[35:52] there's healing in that name
[35:58] amen
[36:02] praise the lord
[36:04] and once you're in that name once you're
[36:07] a part of christ
[36:10] wow
[36:13] once you're in him
[36:15] wow
[36:20] you
[36:21] are going to inherit
[36:22] the earth
[36:24] i mean believe that
[36:27] everything
[36:30] is yours
[36:32] i've got it wrote down but
[36:35] i got the thought wrote down but i
[36:36] didn't go to scripture so i won't go to
[36:38] scripture but y'all remember where paul
[36:39] said
[36:40] all things are yours
[36:43] whether things present or the future
[36:47] isn't that right
[36:49] even
[36:51] death everything paul said
[36:53] everything he when he paid for the price
[36:55] he bought the whole world and he
[36:59] paid for every divine blessing
[37:04] he made so that if you want to you could
[37:06] become a son psy god you can be redeemed
[37:08] back to god you can go back into
[37:10] fellowship with god if you need healing
[37:12] you can have that if you want salvation
[37:14] you can have that whatever
[37:17] jesus said whatever you ask
[37:21] i will do it
[37:23] if you're in my name
[37:25] but you got to ask
[37:26] in my name
[37:28] because what can you do without him
[37:33] john 10.
[37:36] nothing
[37:38] you can do nothing
[37:41] without him
[37:42] without being
[37:44] in him
[37:45] and if you are in him
[37:47] we go from nothing
[37:51] to everything
[37:53] i mean believes everything's it all
[37:54] belongs to you
[37:56] why because you're in christ he owns it
[37:57] all
[37:58] he bought it all he is above every
[38:00] principality every power
[38:04] and his word says
[38:06] his word says that one day
[38:09] we won't have to live in this chaos
[38:11] anymore but we're going to come back
[38:14] and what's going to be on their feet
[38:15] whenever we walk
[38:17] the wicked shall be ashes under the
[38:19] soles of your feet
[38:23] if i take it literally folks we're going
[38:25] to walk on the ashes of the wicked
[38:27] they're going to get burned we're going
[38:28] to walk on their ashes
[38:32] that's the way i understand it
[38:34] and that right
[38:36] that's how much
[38:38] we are above
[38:39] all these things we just don't feel we
[38:42] fail to realize
[38:44] why do you think that brother banham
[38:46] could say and make the statement we are
[38:47] living a million miles below our
[38:49] god-given privileges
[38:52] because i don't think we were catching
[38:53] what privileges we really have at our
[38:55] disposal
[38:57] i don't care what it is you need to
[38:58] overcome
[39:00] you can if you'll believe
[39:02] i don't care what you
[39:04] you need spiritually it's been provided
[39:08] that's why the prophet of god could say
[39:09] if jesus was standing in this suit and
[39:11] you say heal me he'd say i can't
[39:16] that's death that's really big that's a
[39:18] mouthful i would never say the problem
[39:19] said
[39:21] but i understand where he's coming from
[39:23] he would tell you i already did
[39:27] i did that when i paid for by the blood
[39:30] that was put on my back
[39:32] by
[39:33] his stripes when i took those stripes
[39:35] all you have to do is accept it you have
[39:37] to receive it
[39:39] but abraham said the sinner can come up
[39:40] to the altar and cry for days and weeks
[39:42] and weep and repent for weeks and days
[39:44] and so forth but if that person don't
[39:46] ever accept what god has done you'll
[39:47] never get a deliverance
[39:50] you have to accept what god has done for
[39:51] you you actually have to accept your
[39:53] forgiveness
[39:54] amen receive it i accept the lord
[39:58] amen and go from there
[40:00] because testimony is like i can't never
[40:02] do it i can't overcome that's all the
[40:04] devil's talking that's the devil's
[40:05] language that's what he wants you to
[40:06] believe you'll never change it'll never
[40:09] no no no no real believer
[40:12] yes absolutely we believe that jesus
[40:15] died for you and it's yours
[40:18] aren't you glad for that
[40:20] where two or three agree on anything i
[40:23] will
[40:25] do it whatever
[40:27] you ask in my name
[40:29] that will i do
[40:30] but you have to first
[40:33] be planted in christ
[40:34] how many notes that as a christian when
[40:36] you become a christian
[40:39] when you are filled with the holy ghost
[40:41] when you are in that name
[40:49] you're a part of
[40:50] god whatever you do
[40:53] from there on how many knows we we're
[40:55] buried in jesus we rose in jesus
[40:57] whatever we do or whatever we say it's
[40:59] all supposed to be done in jesus
[41:01] christ's name
[41:03] how many think when you pray for
[41:04] somebody in the name of jesus christ
[41:05] receive your healing in the name of
[41:06] jesus christ receive healing
[41:09] why because there's power in that name
[41:14] first
[41:15] you get into it by joining some local
[41:17] church
[41:20] putting your name on a book somewhere
[41:23] how many knows it doesn't matter you
[41:24] know i trust all of us is filled with
[41:26] the holy ghost but if you're not filled
[41:27] with the holy ghost you remember
[41:28] everything like tabernacle but you're
[41:30] not maybe a member of the body of christ
[41:33] huh
[41:35] for by
[41:36] one spirit are we all baptized into
[41:41] one body
[41:42] it takes the baptism of the holy ghost
[41:44] amen and then the great thing about it
[41:47] is when you're a christian like i said
[41:48] we try to comprehend
[41:51] all these
[41:52] things
[41:55] ever had bought any kind of a food that
[41:58] said
[41:58] just add water
[42:03] just add water
[42:07] you become a person brothers and sisters
[42:09] when you're a christian because you have
[42:11] been planted in christ
[42:14] brother bram talks about how that an
[42:15] apple tree you take a
[42:17] seed of
[42:19] apple tree or whatever
[42:22] how little it is
[42:23] every bushel of apples that will ever be
[42:26] will be is in that
[42:29] and you plant it in the ground amen and
[42:31] that's how it is when a christian has
[42:33] that little form of the holy ghost
[42:35] baptism down in his heart
[42:38] god is planting it in your heart he's
[42:40] planted in there
[42:44] then what has to happen you put it in
[42:46] the ground and what is the first thing
[42:48] you do when you plant something if
[42:49] you're wise
[42:51] usually when i'm sowing grass or
[42:52] whatever i'll wait for about a day or so
[42:54] before the rains come
[42:56] then get it in the ground just before
[42:58] that rain because that water is really
[43:00] what's going to do the trick
[43:03] amen we are planted in christ and
[43:06] everything that we have need of is in
[43:08] that holy spirit in that name is right
[43:10] in you then
[43:13] praise god
[43:15] all you got to do is what
[43:18] just add water
[43:20] amen that's the prophet god says drink
[43:22] more than your allotted potion
[43:25] in other words head you know
[43:27] oh my i'm convinced if anybody's got
[43:30] cancer if anybody got sickness i don't
[43:32] care what it is what you really need to
[43:34] do is water the holy ghost in you
[43:39] huh
[43:41] because if you
[43:42] don't have the holy ghost or you're
[43:44] really really low on faith
[43:47] or even don't think you're worthy i mean
[43:50] second you think you're not worthy well
[43:51] then you probably ain't gonna get
[43:57] brother
[43:58] brother brother tommy sent me a little
[44:02] clip of brother billy paul at donny
[44:04] reagan's years ago
[44:06] i know it was years ago because brother
[44:07] donnie was sitting in the background
[44:08] with black hair
[44:10] and billy paul was up there just to
[44:12] testifying and i didn't catch all of it
[44:15] but i caught up where uh brother banham
[44:17] had prayed for billy paul and brother
[44:19] billy paul came back and said i didn't
[44:21] get it you know and he said no i'm not
[44:22] praying for you again
[44:24] it's really rough i'm not praying for
[44:26] you again you know you let me down and
[44:28] you let god down i'm not paying for you
[44:30] again
[44:34] god said to do it i prayed for you the
[44:36] way it's supposed to be you have to
[44:37] receive it and accept it
[44:39] i'm like whoa
[44:41] huh
[44:42] but that's about the truth
[44:44] he has to take it in
[44:46] he has to receive it it's a personal
[44:48] relationship
[44:50] when the elders of the church have
[44:52] prayed for you
[44:53] huh
[44:54] right then you go and you believe that
[44:56] it's done
[44:57] no matter how you feel no matter how
[44:59] long you feel bad
[45:02] amen
[45:04] praise the lord
[45:07] i hope sisterly his shoulders better
[45:09] already
[45:10] if not just hang in there it will
[45:13] when you get prayed for something but
[45:14] you come up forever every service it's
[45:16] not better
[45:19] and the second time you get prayed for
[45:21] and it don't matter you're gonna have
[45:22] less faith next time
[45:25] amen because it's really your faith in
[45:27] god that doesn't how many believes that
[45:31] god said it i believe it that settles it
[45:35] you love him
[45:37] amen whatever you ask
[45:40] in my name
[45:41] i
[45:43] will do it
[45:45] don't you just love him for those
[45:47] precious words
[45:50] acts one
[45:53] no it isn't one you see which one it is
[45:56] here
[45:59] acts 4.
[46:01] let's go to acts 4.
[46:07] how many believes that the disciples
[46:08] were filled with the power of god
[46:12] just as any christian or any church
[46:14] is filled with the power of god let me
[46:16] say this tonight
[46:18] if this church ever doesn't have the
[46:21] power of god in it anymore
[46:24] god will lead us
[46:29] hmm
[46:30] what did the prophet say god hates a
[46:32] powerless religion
[46:34] it hates a powerless religion if your
[46:36] religion doesn't have power in it some
[46:38] god doesn't like that
[46:42] like i talked last wednesday talk about
[46:43] we can say one thing but it's what we do
[46:47] i mean we can you can say you believe
[46:49] christ but have you got the power has
[46:51] god come and confirmed your faith
[46:56] amen
[46:57] praise the lord
[47:00] acts two and we'll begin with verse
[47:04] uh
[47:06] let me just start with
[47:07] verse one of chapter
[47:09] and as they spake unto the people the
[47:11] priests and the captains of the temple
[47:13] and the sad jewish seas and came unto
[47:15] them being grieved that they taught the
[47:18] people
[47:19] and preached through jesus
[47:21] the resurrection from the dead
[47:24] and they laid hands on them and put them
[47:26] in to hold until the next day for it was
[47:29] now even tied
[47:30] how be it
[47:32] many of them which heard the word
[47:34] believed and the number of the men which
[47:36] was about five thousand
[47:39] and it came to pass on tomorrow
[47:41] that the rulers
[47:43] and elders and scribes and anista high
[47:46] priests
[47:47] campuses and john
[47:49] alexander as many as were of the kindred
[47:52] of the high priest we're gathered
[47:54] together in jerusalem so here we are
[47:57] what a scene
[47:58] all the big shots all the main god
[48:01] everybody gathered
[48:03] and when they had set them in the midst
[48:05] they asked
[48:07] by what power
[48:10] or by what name
[48:14] amen
[48:15] how many believes the name is important
[48:18] let me tell you something god winked at
[48:20] things just i'll get you to the rest of
[48:22] here in a minute god winked at the
[48:24] ignorance of martin luther and john
[48:25] wesley and all those that never used the
[48:27] name of jesus christ
[48:28] in salvation and baptism he went at it
[48:31] because they didn't know any better but
[48:32] once you are presented with uh
[48:35] with something like
[48:37] there was never nobody ever baptized in
[48:40] the titles of father son and the holy
[48:41] ghost in the bible
[48:43] boom right there it's over with
[48:45] you're now responsible to know that
[48:47] nobody was ever baptized that way and
[48:49] there's only one way to ever baptize and
[48:51] that is in the name of jesus christ you
[48:53] can't walk away from there and be the
[48:54] same anymore
[48:56] no you have to straight up
[48:58] turn down light
[49:00] amen
[49:03] aren't you glad that we was brought the
[49:04] name the name was brought back
[49:07] okay
[49:09] so he says
[49:10] what power
[49:13] what name have you done this
[49:16] remember the impotent man right
[49:18] then peter filled with the holy ghost
[49:21] said unto them ye rulers of the people
[49:23] and elders of israel if we this day be
[49:26] examined of the good teeth done by the
[49:29] impotent man
[49:31] by what means he has made hope let be it
[49:34] known unto you all
[49:37] and to the people of israel that by the
[49:40] name of jesus christ of nazareth
[49:44] amen
[49:47] whom he crucified
[49:49] oh my
[49:51] what i had to hurt
[49:53] whom ye crucified
[49:56] god raised from the dead even by him
[50:00] does this man stand
[50:03] here before you whole
[50:08] this is the stone which was said that
[50:10] not of you builders which is become the
[50:13] head of the corner

[50:20] hallelujah
[50:22] boy i wish the whole world would hear
[50:23] that there is no salvation in any other
[50:25] name you think you're going to go to
[50:27] heaven

[50:29] go to heaven except by the name of jesus
[50:32] christ

[50:35] one day sooner or later every knee shall
[50:37] bow every tongue confessed that jesus
[50:40] christ is lord

[51:09] power does this
[51:11] they said by the name of jesus christ of
[51:14] nazareth is how this is done
[51:17] how many believes if you do anything
[51:20] worth anything it's going to be because
[51:23] of the name of the lord jesus christ
[51:27] the greatest name
[51:29] ever spoken from human lips
[51:31] they wrote many songs about the great
[51:33] name
[51:34] of jesus there's nothing like his name
[51:38] no name above it

[51:48] in the name of jesus christ in my name
[51:50] they shall cast out devils how many
[51:52] knows that's the only way devils move is
[51:55] by the name of the lord jesus christ

[51:59] they shall lay hands on the sick in the
[52:01] name of jesus christ and they shall
[52:03] recover
[52:04] there's no other name given under men
[52:07] among me under heaven whereby
[52:11] you
