[37:00] we appreciate you being here and just
[37:02] looking just evaluating the crowd
[37:05] brother
[37:06] Mooney good to see you
[37:09] buddy so we want to take a little
[37:11] service tonight if we would and while
[37:14] you're standing I won't you turn into
[37:15] the Book of Genesis and chapter 41 and
[37:18] we just get right into the word
[37:20] Wednesday nights we try not to hold and
[37:23] and that's our that's our intentions is
[37:24] try to get you out not that we're trying
[37:26] to rush and we're not pushing we want to
[37:28] get into the word and stay into the word
[37:30] but we definitely want to uh get you
[37:32] home at a decent hour school's started
[37:34] the days are getting shorter and and we
[37:36] know you got things uh pressing on you
[37:39] for tomorrow so but how many can give us
[37:42] 40 30 40 minutes of tonight for the Lord
[37:45] amen I believe he's worthy and desire
[37:48] and deserves at least 40 45 minutes of
[37:50] our
[37:52] time because he devotes all of his time
[37:55] to his bread so
[37:58] um while you turn in there I'm going to
[37:59] read you just a little quote I want you
[38:01] to to listen to this and brother
[38:03] brandom's talking here and he says his
[38:06] church stands alone now where he uses
[38:08] church I'm going to use bride you know
[38:10] he said those words could be changed out
[38:12] at the end he said the church is the
[38:14] bride so he says and his bride stands
[38:18] alone she is not hooked with
[38:21] nothing she's not hooked with nothing
[38:25] but he was identified by God God being
[38:28] the body that God dwelt in and the bride
[38:30] is identified by his body doing the same
[38:34] thing she is his body brothers and
[38:37] sisters we are God In
[38:40] Action we are his
[38:44] body in his body the manifested truth of
[38:48] his promised word for the last day and
[38:51] she listen to what he says and she and
[38:53] she alone stands by it
[38:58] am what is it she's standing by she is
[39:02] standing upon the infallible word of
[39:04] Jesus Christ she is standing and living
[39:08] the message of the hour she is standing
[39:11] there you see because there's many
[39:13] churches there's there's many churches
[39:16] there's many Christians there's many
[39:18] Creeds many
[39:20] religions but what they are they
[39:22] standing
[39:24] on it's not the word
[39:27] it's not the message of the hour they're
[39:30] standing upon
[39:31] Creeds but she and she alone stands by
[39:35] it he says that's why the devil is
[39:38] howling and that's why these great
[39:40] organizations to set up to do something
[39:43] to close her
[39:46] up it's the devil's goal to try to stop
[39:50] you to hold you back to keep you from
[39:53] being who God wants you to be
[39:58] so here we can see today as we're
[39:59] looking at this we can see that the
[40:00] church system the political system the
[40:03] secular World their whole purpose is to
[40:06] hinder the moving of the spirit of God
[40:08] in action in the last days so they're
[40:11] discouraging
[40:13] Holiness they're discouraging a holy way
[40:16] of
[40:17] living a a and and instead of inviting
[40:20] Holiness and welcoming the power of God
[40:23] in their midst they have an attitude of
[40:26] anything go
[40:28] anything is tolerated as long as you
[40:32] come on Sunday as long as you come to
[40:34] the dinner as long as you come on
[40:36] Wednesday as long as you're at the
[40:37] prayer meeting the Bible
[40:39] study everything goes come as you
[40:43] are their motto is come as you are I
[40:45] guess leave as you
[40:48] are ours is a little different come as
[40:51] you are everybody's welcome but don't
[40:53] leave the way you can't
[40:57] and that's the way it is every time we
[40:59] come to church I don't care how long
[41:02] you've been serving every time we come
[41:04] it should be that we come to God change
[41:08] me if I have a bad attitude if I have a
[41:11] a ill desire if there's something in my
[41:14] life that is that is that is a desire or
[41:17] a habit that is not pleasing God change
[41:21] me because why I stand by the
[41:26] word that try to close her up listen
[41:29] what he says but they'll never do
[41:33] it that gives some reassurance they'll
[41:36] never do
[41:38] it he says she'll be taken up not closed
[41:42] up taken up now she's risen and now by
[41:47] the power of the Vindicated word
[41:49] promised to her how a bride holds on to
[41:52] that promise he said he told me he would
[41:56] return after me and I believe it do you
[41:59] believe it tell your neighbor I believe
[42:02] it he's coming after me I'm standing on
[42:06] the
[42:08] word yeah he says to meet what her
[42:13] headship to meet her headship you mean
[42:16] she's not
[42:18] headstrong she's obedient to the
[42:22] headship I'm talking about the
[42:25] bride I'm not talking about other
[42:27] systems I'm talking about the bride now
[42:29] she's waiting on him and to meet her
[42:31] headship her Redeemer her husband her
[42:35] King her
[42:36] Lord you mean she's
[42:40] submissive you can only call Lord
[42:42] somebody that you're submitting
[42:44] to we were at a restaurant and I'm
[42:47] keeping y'all standing forgive me we

[43:39] can we find such a one as this a man
[43:43] whom the spirit of God is and Pharaoh
[43:46] said unto Joseph for as much as God has

[43:58] thou sh be over my house and according
[44:01] to Thy word shall all my people be ruled
[44:05] only in the throne will I be greater
[44:07] than thou and Pharaoh said unto Joseph
[44:10] see I have set over thee all the land of
[44:14] Egypt and Pharaoh took off his ring off
[44:18] of his hand and put it on Joseph's hand
[44:20] and arrayed him with vestures of fine
[44:22] linen and put a gold chain about his
[44:24] neck and he made him ride in the second
[44:27] Chariot which he had and they cried
[44:30] before him bow the knee and he made him
[44:33] ruler over all the land of Egypt and
[44:37] Pharaoh said unto Joseph I am pharaoh
[44:40] and without thee shall no man lift up
[44:42] his hand or foot in all the land of
[44:44] Egypt and Pharaoh called Joseph name
[44:48] zephani panah and he gave him a wife
[44:53] asath the daughter of Piper priest of an
[44:57] and Joseph went out over all the land of
[45:00] Egypt now watch this and Joseph was 30
[45:03] years old when he stood before Pharaoh
[45:05] king of Egypt and Joseph went out from
[45:08] the presence of pharaoh and went
[45:09] throughout all the land of Egypt and in
[45:13] seven plenteous years the earth brought
[45:15] forth by
[45:18] handfuls and he gathered up all the food
[45:21] of the seven years which were in the
[45:23] land of Egypt and laid up the food in
[45:25] the cities the food of the field which
[45:28] was round about every city laid he up in
[45:31] the same and Joseph gathered corn as a
[45:33] sand of the sea very much until uh he
[45:36] left numbering for it was without
[45:38] number this man's making
[45:44] preparations and Joseph were born two
[45:46] sons before the years of famine came
[45:48] which were which asenath the son of
[45:51] Piper the priest of an bear unto him and
[45:54] Joseph called the name of the firstborn
[45:55] manassei for God he said hath made me
[45:58] forget all of my toil aren't you
[46:01] thankful for
[46:02] that and all of my father's house and
[46:05] the name of the second was called
[46:06] Ephraim for God hath caused me to be
[46:09] fruitful in the land of my
[46:11] Affliction God won't leave us
[46:15] without and the seven years of plenteous
[46:18] that was the land of Egypt were ended
[46:20] and the seven years of Dar began to come
[46:22] and according as Joseph had said and the
[46:25] DAR was in all the lands and but in the
[46:27] land of Egypt there was bread let's bow
[46:31] our heads Heavenly Father we thankful
[46:33] that you've given us an opportunity to
[46:35] come and just to to get into your
[46:37] presence once again Lord and and and to
[46:39] see what the word and what what your
[46:41] word would have in store for us tonight
[46:43] that your what your spirit would speak
[46:45] to our hearts Lord we just ask that
[46:47] there would be a communion take place
[46:49] tonight that would draw us into a
[46:51] greater love and a greater passion for
[46:53] you father Lord we just ask Lord as we
[46:56] begin to deliver the the word that you
[46:57] would allow me to step myself completely
[46:59] out of the way I'm just a just a
[47:02] microphone tonight Lord but I ask that
[47:04] it would be your voice that would speak
[47:07] to the people tonight and that their
[47:08] hearts would be open Lord to to receive
[47:11] what you have tonight for us we love you
[47:13] Lord and thank you for this day in Jesus
[47:15] name amen you can have your seats
[47:18] tonight I want to speak for just a
[47:20] little bit if I could on a topic I'm
[47:23] going to call Fit For A King fit Fit For
[47:27] A King now I don't know about you but I
[47:31] just love to see myself in the word of
[47:34] God how many loves to see yourself in
[47:37] the word of God that's important because
[47:40] when you find yourself identified in the
[47:42] word of God you can then begin to relate
[47:45] to the word and that word begins to
[47:47] speak to you and it begins to to do you
[47:50] something in your heart and it begins to
[47:51] mold you and make you it shows you how
[47:54] much God cares about you it shows you
[47:57] how much he loves you and it places you
[48:00] in God's
[48:02] thoughts now as we look at this tonight
[48:04] about 25% of the Book of Genesis is
[48:07] about Joseph and so uh and I it's like
[48:11] we get to know him personally when we
[48:14] look at the Book of Genesis and read
[48:16] about Joseph God has opened up so many
[48:18] great details about his character he
[48:21] tells us about his strengths he tells us
[48:23] about his weaknesses he tells us how he
[48:25] overcomes adversity he tells us how he
[48:28] forgives how he provides and we can go
[48:31] on and on and on because of everyone in
[48:33] the Bible Joseph is most the person that
[48:36] is most like
[48:38] Jesus so I want to take and just lay a
[48:41] foundation and I want to lay a
[48:43] foundation tonight and as you listen to
[48:45] these comparisons let's take a little
[48:46] time here Joseph was his father's
[48:50] favorite
[48:52] son the father said of Jesus this is my
[48:55] beloved
[48:57] son Joseph was a
[49:00] Shepherd Jesus we know was The Good The
[49:03] Great the chief
[49:05] Shepherd Joseph was sent by his father
[49:08] to search for his brother Jesus said
[49:10] peace to you as the father has sent me I
[49:13] also send
[49:14] you are you seeing the
[49:17] correlation Joseph was rejected by his
[49:20] brothers and they said you will NE we
[49:22] would you will never rule over
[49:24] us and Jesus came came to his own and
[49:28] his own received him
[49:31] not Joseph wept when his brothers didn't
[49:34] recognize him Jesus wept when Jerusalem
[49:37] when over Jerusalem when Israel didn't
[49:39] recognize him as the
[49:41] Messiah Joseph suffered to save the very
[49:44] ones who betrayed him in silence they
[49:47] never knew who he was but yet he saved
[49:50] them Isaiah says of Jesus like a sheep
[49:53] being led to
[49:55] slaughter or a lamb that is silent
[49:58] before its
[50:00] shearers he did not open his
[50:04] mouth what a
[50:06] picture Joseph was betrayed by Judah his
[50:10] own brother his own Kindred for 20
[50:13] pieces of
[50:14] silver Jesus was betrayed by Judas his
[50:18] brother in Christ his brother around him
[50:20] his disciple for 30 pieces of silver
[50:24] Joseph wears a coat of many colors which
[50:27] signifies
[50:29] royalty and they put a purple robe on
[50:32] Jesus to confess that he was he was
[50:36] Jesus and a crown of thorns upon his
[50:40] head Joseph goes down into a pit into
[50:43] Egypt down into a prison and you look in
[50:46] the Book of Psalms David describes this
[50:48] pit and I want you to listen how David
[50:50] describes the pit that Joseph was in he
[50:52] says that pit was as death hell and the
[50:55] grave
[50:59] Jesus went down into the grave but on
[51:01] the third day he conquered death hell
[51:03] and the grave he rose again Joseph is
[51:06] alive Jesus is Alive the two were going
[51:09] hand in hand Joseph got a gentile
[51:13] wife Jesus has a gentile
[51:19] bride this is
[51:22] good Joseph began his ministry at the
[51:25] age of 30 Jesus begins his ministry at
[51:28] the age of
[51:30] 30 listen to this this is the one I
[51:33] think is one of the greatest the world
[51:35] came to Joseph to be
[51:39] saved and there is salvation and no
[51:42] other name but the name of Jesus Christ
[51:45] do you realize the world would have died
[51:48] would have dried up and died had Joseph
[51:50] not have stored up and stored up and
[51:52] stored up but God had a plan for Joseph
[51:56] he was telling him you will be my type
[51:59] of Christ to the bride you will show the
[52:02] bride who she
[52:04] is so it's clear as we see this and as
[52:07] we look into the scripture reading
[52:09] tonight the life of Joseph is an amazing
[52:12] story of the power of almighty God and
[52:15] we look at this we see Joseph set
[52:17] suffering in a prison we see him set
[52:20] suffering in a prison down in the palace
[52:23] and Pharaoh we know has a dream and
[52:26] pharaoh has this dream that he cannot
[52:29] interpret but Joseph was
[52:32] remembered you remember there was a guy
[52:34] that said Remember
[52:36] Me Joseph was remembered and they called
[52:40] Joseph up and Joseph interprets
[52:42] Pharaoh's dream and Pharaoh does what he
[52:46] looks at Joseph and said there is none
[52:48] like you in the land I don't know your
[52:51] God I don't know exactly what you
[52:53] believe but one thing I know about you
[52:55] the spirit that is within you and the
[52:58] spirit that you commune with is one like
[53:00] I've never seen before I exalt thee
[53:05] Joseph I'm going to elevate you
[53:09] Joseph so here Joseph goes from a prison
[53:13] are you with me from a prison house and
[53:16] now he's been elevated up into into a
[53:19] position and the first thing that he was
[53:22] was given was what a bride
[53:28] did you realize that in the scriptures
[53:29] when you're reading that do you realize
[53:31] the first thing he was given was a
[53:33] gentile
[53:36] bride a gift from the
[53:42] father soon after that we see that
[53:46] Joseph has a family and Joseph's family
[53:48] is born in Egypt and Joseph's Gentile
[53:52] bride we can see now types the Bride of
[53:54] Jesus Christ
[53:56] and over in the Book of Genesis I want I
[53:58] want going to look at a couple of people
[53:59] tonight we're going to look at Rebecca
[54:01] we're going to look at Rebecca who is a
[54:03] picture of the calling of the Bride of
[54:05] Jesus Christ or the called out bride of
[54:07] Jesus Christ and we're going to look at
[54:09] asenath who is a picture of the
[54:11] coronation or the crowning of a queen of
[54:14] a
[54:16] king you realize there's going to be a
[54:21] crown there's going to be a Queen of
[54:24] Heaven I'm looking at
[54:27] her I said I'm looking at her there's
[54:30] going to be a queen that will sit right
[54:32] at the throne at the very Throne of
[54:35] Jesus Christ a redeemed bride a gentile
[54:39] bride that he come down for and said I'm
[54:41] going to take you
[54:45] home so let's look at her you say h h
[54:48] how can this woman be that bride well
[54:50] we'll see some types that may match up
[54:52] some of our Lives whether we like it or
[54:54] not
[54:57] asath the woman that was received as the
[55:00] bride she was raised worshiping false
[55:05] gods she was raised worshiping
[55:09] Idols you place your idol
[55:12] there football basketball women men
[55:17] alcohol whatever so she is raised
[55:21] worshiping these false pagan gods and
[55:24] asenath is clueless to to the god of
[55:27] Abraham she's clueless to the god of
[55:29] Abraham Jacob and Joseph she do even
[55:31] aware of God knew nothing about him but
[55:35] the good thing about it was God knew
[55:39] her you see you may have been living in
[55:41] a place that you knew nothing about God
[55:43] you knew nothing about the message of
[55:45] the hour but God knew who you were I
[55:48] said God knew who you were
[55:51] tonight he know you wasn't going to be
[55:53] content living in Egypt
[55:56] you would not be content living in the
[55:59] secular
[56:00] world it's not in
[56:05] you she's a picture of lost
[56:09] Humanity but then we can take it right
[56:11] to the scripture in Ephesians and
[56:12] Ephesian tells us that that he ha
[56:14] quickened those that were dead in
[56:16] trespasses and
[56:19] sin that's us he quickened where in time
[56:23] pass walking according to the course of
[56:25] what this world
[56:27] I think every about every one of us
[56:29] sitting here could say we've walked the
[56:31] course of this
[56:34] world we're no different than anybody
[56:36] else that comeing to this world speaking
[56:38] lies we were all a bunch of liars
[56:41] cheaters
[56:43] thieves greed
[56:49] jealous walking into this course of this
[56:52] world according to the prince of the
[56:53] power of this air you mean we were given
[56:56] over to Satan absolutely if you were
[56:58] living that life you were living the
[56:59] life of one of Satan's
[57:03] Children thank God we wouldn't adopted
[57:05] into that
[57:10] family that was just a foster
[57:14] home you were just there till something
[57:16] came along that would love you and
[57:19] nurture you and pull you in and protect
[57:21] you and keep you and watch over you
[57:28] the spirit that now worketh in the
[57:29] children of disobedient among who also
[57:31] we had our conversations in time pass
[57:34] with the lust of our flesh fulfilling
[57:36] the desires of the flesh yeah that's
[57:39] what it says we were by Nature the
[57:41] children of
[57:42] Wrath
[57:44] asath an
[57:46] Egyptian serving Egyptians serving the
[57:49] gods of
[57:52] Egypt but
[57:54] God you you know what it says but God
[57:58] who is rich in
[58:00] Mercy but God who was rich in Mercy for
[58:03] asenath God who was rich in Mercy for
[58:06] you God who was rich in Mercy for I that
[58:09] God that very God he loved us so much he
[58:14] loved us so much that even when we were
[58:17] dead in our
[58:19] sins he have quickened us together with
[58:21] Christ he's raised us up
[58:24] together and made made us to set in
[58:26] Heavenly
[58:28] places with Joseph oh that's not what it
[58:31] said is
[58:33] it in Heavenly places with Christ
[58:37] Jesus so you mean to tell me that he
[58:40] picked us up when you were
[58:43] lifeless he cares so much that he looked
[58:46] at you and he picked you up when you
[58:47] were lifeless and he set you down in the
[58:50] highest of Heavens in the company of
[58:53] Jesus what a oh what a
[58:59] savior we ought to sing from the
[59:04] rooftops because it says We Were
[59:06] Strangers from the covenants of promise
[59:08] we didn't even know the word we didn't
[59:09] know a promise of Jesus we knew not a
[59:12] promise of
[59:16] Salvation having no
[59:19] hope let me tell you the life I was
[59:21] living was a life of no
[59:24] hope it was a life of of Disobedience it
[59:27] was a life without
[59:31] God but he drew us nigh by the blood of
[59:34] Jesus
[59:38] Christ the blood of Jesus
[59:43] Christ so this is just a
[59:46] reminder of what what we were before the
[59:49] Lord Jesus Christ this is what asenath
[59:52] was before she met
[59:54] Joseph this was the kind of life she
[59:56] lived but it all have to come the same
[59:59] way through a repentant heart through
[1:00:01] the blood of Jesus
[1:00:06] Christ she came to
[1:00:09] Joseph we came to Jesus that blood had
[1:00:13] began to blot out the sins of Our
[1:00:17] Lives because something spoke to us in
[1:00:19] our hearts and there was a repentance
[1:00:21] made on the inside that said I can't
[1:00:24] live like this anymore
[1:00:26] this is not who I
[1:00:30] am asenath looked at this and said I
[1:00:32] can't be a queen the way I
[1:00:36] live oh Joseph you got the ring you got
[1:00:39] the robe you got the authority but I'm
[1:00:41] not
[1:00:43] worthy but because of the
[1:00:45] blood but because of the blood there's a
[1:00:48] bumper between us and heaven and Jesus
[1:00:50] stands in the Gap and that our sins go
[1:00:53] up and they hit the bumper and they fall
[1:00:55] back into what the Sea of God's
[1:01:03] forgetfulness I want you to know
[1:01:04] something when Joseph got out of that
[1:01:06] prison when Joseph got out of that
[1:01:08] prison prison and he was promoted to to
[1:01:11] a position of power and authority and
[1:01:14] majesty and that sounds like a great
[1:01:16] thing right we're talking about our
[1:01:18] Jesus that's a great thing we know he's
[1:01:20] the power The Authority the the King of
[1:01:22] Kings the Lord of
[1:01:24] lords but what what happened to
[1:01:31] Asen oh you got
[1:01:37] quiet as Joseph was
[1:01:41] elevated she was
[1:01:45] elevated the higher he got the higher
[1:01:48] she
[1:01:49] got are you with
[1:01:51] me are you with me so the more we lift
[1:01:54] up the name of Jesus the more you're
[1:01:56] lifted up the more we praise the
[1:01:59] almighty God the more you're lifted up
[1:02:01] the more we sing the songs of Zion the
[1:02:03] more we're lifted up you say well I'm
[1:02:05] singing to God but it's lifting up his
[1:02:07] bride because she identifies in who she
[1:02:10] is the more you think on Heavenly things
[1:02:14] the more you'll find yourself in
[1:02:16] Heavenly
[1:02:21] places asth now finds herself as the
[1:02:25] bride of the most powerful man in the
[1:02:28] entire
[1:02:30] world do you realize
[1:02:34] that you mean I'm the Bride of the most
[1:02:36] powerful man in the entire
[1:02:41] world sometimes we fail to realize that
[1:02:45] we fail to give credit where credit is
[1:02:48] due and she now sits there as the most
[1:02:51] uh as the Bride of the of the most
[1:02:53] powerful man in the entire world he's
[1:02:55] got the ring he's got the robe he's got
[1:02:57] people bowing down they obey his every
[1:03:00] word so let me ask you this was she Fit
[1:03:03] For A
[1:03:08] King after something got a hold of her
[1:03:11] life in the beginning she
[1:03:14] wasn't in herself she wasn't in the old
[1:03:18] Asin she wasn't on her own she wasn't it
[1:03:22] was not an honor that she could achieve
[1:03:23] on her own and you and I would never
[1:03:26] achieve it on our own that's why we have
[1:03:29] to have the Holy Ghost and Fire Burning
[1:03:33] in our
[1:03:36] souls it's the Holy Ghost in fire that's
[1:03:39] keeping me
[1:03:41] alive it's not
[1:03:43] myself I fail in myself I fall short in
[1:03:47] myself I have hatred in
[1:03:50] myself yeah I'm being honest with
[1:03:54] you you be honest with
[1:03:58] yourself but it wasn't something she
[1:04:01] achieved on her
[1:04:02] own but the thing about it she had no
[1:04:05] choice in the
[1:04:07] matter do you realize she had no choice
[1:04:10] in the matter she had no choice in the
[1:04:12] matter Michael John because she was a
[1:04:14] chosen Bride for Joseph you and I have
[1:04:17] no choice in the matter because we are a
[1:04:20] chosen Bride for Jesus Christ
[1:04:23] [Applause]
[1:04:27] when you're chosen it don't matter what
[1:04:29] you
[1:04:32] think brothers and sisters this is a
[1:04:34] picture of the bride and the father's
[1:04:38] gift John says henceforth I call you not
[1:04:41] servants for the servant knoweth not
[1:04:43] what his Lord doeth but I have called
[1:04:45] you friends for the all things that I
[1:04:48] have heard of my father have made known
[1:04:50] unto you you have not chosen me
[1:04:55] but I chose
[1:04:57] you I ordained
[1:05:01] you what is an ordination an ordination
[1:05:03] is when you give somebody the
[1:05:06] authority to do something on the behalf
[1:05:09] of when you ordain a minister you say
[1:05:12] this person is ordained to preach the
[1:05:14] word of God and he says I'm ordaining
[1:05:17] you the bride of Christ to be my
[1:05:20] representation on the earth while I'm
[1:05:22] not here so why are we living the way we
[1:05:25] do we should live a higher
[1:05:32] standard he saves us he elevates us he
[1:05:35] changes our lives he fills us with the
[1:05:38] Holy
[1:05:41] Ghost Joseph was given the name zaniah
[1:05:45] panah by Pharaoh do you know what that
[1:05:48] means in
[1:05:49] Egyptian I'm GNA tell you write this
[1:05:54] down zephan panah I'm not going to spell
[1:05:57] it for you you have to look it
[1:05:58] up it means in Egyptian savior of the
[1:06:06] world and in Hebrew it means one who
[1:06:10] reveals
[1:06:14] Mysteries
[1:06:15] wow one who reveals
[1:06:20] Mysteries I can't help but
[1:06:23] imagine the conversation that asan and
[1:06:27] Joseph must have had I can't help but
[1:06:29] imagine how they might have been laying
[1:06:30] in a field together hand in hand telling
[1:06:34] each other how much they loved each
[1:06:36] other how thankful she was to have met
[1:06:38] him and to come in contact and to be
[1:06:40] chosen as his
[1:06:42] bride and I can imagine as I hear her
[1:06:46] say tell me about our
[1:06:51] God tell me about our God you know she
[1:06:53] had no knowledge
[1:06:57] tell me about our God tell me about the
[1:06:59] Garden of Eden again
[1:07:01] Joseph tell me how God came down and he
[1:07:04] created a garden and a domain for Adam
[1:07:06] and Eve and they run it and and it was a
[1:07:08] perfect paradise and how how our God

[1:10:43] Christ I don't want no part of Egypt
[1:10:47] anymore Egypt is a thing of the
[1:10:50] past I'm seeing the
[1:10:52] future let's talk about Rebecca for just
[1:10:55] just a
[1:10:56] minute Rebecca her life began in a way
[1:10:59] it seemed ordinary you see there's
[1:11:00] different roads some people don't know
[1:11:01] nothing some people raised in the church
[1:11:03] J raised in a in a in a church home
[1:11:06] message home some people like Asen I
[1:11:08] knew nothing of God but here's Rebecca
[1:11:10] who was raised into a into a a house
[1:11:13] that knew something about the word of
[1:11:14] God who who worshiped a God she didn't
[1:11:17] worship gods of the world but to her
[1:11:19] this was just an ordinary
[1:11:23] life and Rebecca grew up to be a a a
[1:11:26] real beautiful woman she was
[1:11:31] Spirited but in her beauty and in her
[1:11:35] spirit she kept her moral
[1:11:38] pure she kept herself her family just to
[1:11:42] lay a background her family was
[1:11:44] prosperous they were prosperous enough
[1:11:46] that they had
[1:11:48] servants but yet she wasn't uh coddled
[1:11:51] and treated like a princess she was
[1:11:53] raised to work hard she was raised to go
[1:11:56] out in the house and to fetch water for
[1:11:58] the family every evening she would have
[1:12:00] to go out and Hoist the vessel this Clay
[1:12:02] Pot a lot of times we hear the story we
[1:12:05] think well she's packing some five
[1:12:06] gallon buckets no no no no she's packing
[1:12:09] maybe a three gallon four gallon clay
[1:12:12] pot that's maybe an inch and a half
[1:12:14] thick throwing it up on her shoulders to
[1:12:16] go fetch enough water to get the family
[1:12:21] through and one evening she's out
[1:12:23] filling her pot
[1:12:26] she's out here filling her jar and this
[1:12:29] elderly man runs up to meet her now put
[1:12:32] yourself young ladies in that
[1:12:35] scene scenario you're minding your own
[1:12:40] business you're filling your
[1:12:43] water and some old man comes dirty
[1:12:46] filthy remember he's been on a wagon on
[1:12:49] a on a camel
[1:12:51] train
[1:12:53] stinking 3 week Journey 500
[1:12:58] Miles Dusty dirty filthy stinky and he
[1:13:02] comes running up to her and says hey can
[1:13:04] can you give me a sip of water from your
[1:13:06] jar put yourself
[1:13:09] there I probably drop a pot and run
[1:13:16] myself but she looks at him and she
[1:13:19] says this man has traveled so far I can
[1:13:23] tell by the way he looks so she swings
[1:13:25] her water pot down from her shoulder and
[1:13:27] she gives the man a drink not just a
[1:13:29] mere sip not just enough to wet his
[1:13:32] whistle no she says here you drink and
[1:13:34] have fresh water cool water drink until
[1:13:37] you're
[1:13:38] satisfied and she begins to let him have
[1:13:40] it and and she's looking she looks
[1:13:42] around while he's guzzling through this
[1:13:44] pot can you imagine him guzzling through
[1:13:46] this pot and she looks around and she
[1:13:48] says there's a train of 10
[1:13:51] camels but the trough is empty
[1:13:58] eleazer is looking for someone who's Fit
[1:14:00] For A
[1:14:01] King he's got his eyes on this young
[1:14:04] lady to see if she is Fit For A
[1:14:08] King and he look she's looking around
[1:14:10] and she sees that the camels hasn't been
[1:14:13] tended to and she's looking and she sees
[1:14:16] his kind eyes watching her
[1:14:20] attentively brothers and
[1:14:22] sisters brother brandham said that she
[1:14:25] that he was watching for the sign over
[1:14:30] her do you realize you were under a
[1:14:37] sign there was a cloud in
[1:14:41] Arizona the head of Christ are we are we

[1:14:52] under a sign and he said the prophet
[1:14:54] said he was looking and watching for the
[1:14:56] sign over there because listen there
[1:14:58] could have been thousands of young
[1:15:00] ladies around there that would have
[1:15:01] loved to have
[1:15:04] went but he being a servant a messenger
[1:15:08] from Abraham he took his job very
[1:15:11] serious he couldn't go out and just
[1:15:13] gather and grab the first woman of the
[1:15:15] world and take her back and say here you
[1:15:18] go no that wasn't what he was looking
[1:15:21] for no that wasn't what he was looking

[1:15:55] that was Fit For A
[1:16:01] King he was looking for
[1:16:05] character she wanted to be as generous
[1:16:07] as she would now in the Bible I'm going
[1:16:09] through some scriptures here but you can

[1:16:12] want to read the story later but he goes
[1:16:15] in there and and and he's watching and
[1:16:17] and and and Rebecca wants to be as

[1:17:38] much better than they do at some other
[1:17:40] places that's
[1:17:41] Hospitality that's being hospitable to
[1:17:44] God's
[1:17:45] servants not that we treat them any
[1:17:47] different we treat everybody that way I

[1:17:52] met people that really truly care and
[1:17:54] love and and want to see them excel in
[1:17:56] life and as the Bride of Jesus

[1:23:28] house of bethu Rebecca's father and the
[1:23:31] host offers him a meal
[1:23:33] but he's too excited to
[1:23:36] eat he's too overwhelmed with joy to eat
[1:23:40] and he looks at him and he says let me

[1:23:55] find a a bride for his son
[1:23:58] Isaac and I prayed and I prayed and I
[1:24:02] prayed and I prayed that she would come
[1:24:04] and offer me
[1:24:07] water I
[1:24:09] prayed that she would offer the to to
[1:24:11] water my camels I prayed that she would
[1:24:15] come in there and I would find out that
[1:24:17] she would be blood relatives not of this
[1:24:19] world but a pure lineage of Isaac
[1:24:24] not taken by the world and I prayed and

[1:28:51] walk it ain't pretty
[1:28:55] I can't even mimic it I won't even
[1:28:57] attempt
[1:29:00] to but here you think about Rebecca this
[1:29:03] poor young girl she probably seen plenty
[1:29:06] of camels in her life but you know she
[1:29:09] probably wasn't an experienced Camel
[1:29:11] Rider her family was Shepherd
[1:29:14] people and they say riding a camel is
[1:29:17] one of the most torturous things until
[1:29:19] you're conditioned to
[1:29:20] it and so here she goes now on this 500
[1:29:24] 100 mile
[1:29:27] Journey up and
[1:29:29] down up and
[1:29:32] down but Rebecca looked
[1:29:36] forward she kept looking ahead she kept
[1:29:39] looking to see what the promises was she
[1:29:41] kept looking trying to learn all she
[1:29:43] could from elaser about Isaac and about
[1:29:45] his family and she began to to picture
[1:29:48] the old man talking to her just just
[1:29:50] picture the old man talking to her by
[1:29:52] the campfire when they would stop to
[1:29:53] rest
[1:29:55] and there she sits at the campfire she
[1:29:56] begins to talk elaser tell me about
[1:30:01] him tell me about what I'm getting
[1:30:04] myself into tell me about who will be
[1:30:06] the love of my
[1:30:09] life tell me what he looks like tell me
[1:30:13] tell me how he talks tell me how he
[1:30:17] prays tell me what kind of man he is
[1:30:24] no doubt she just wanted more and more
[1:30:26] and
[1:30:28] more and finally after days of travel
[1:30:33] the Caravan begins to to come into the
[1:30:37] and into the Twilight of the evening and
[1:30:38] the fall of the land and and Rebecca
[1:30:40] looks at there she sees a man walking in
[1:30:42] the
[1:30:43] fields and the Bible says she got off
[1:30:47] quickly she didn't I bet she was tired
[1:30:50] to get off that Camel let me off of this
[1:30:52] thing
[1:30:54] she didn't wait for him to stop you see
[1:30:56] them camels you know they get down on
[1:30:57] one knee and then the other knee and
[1:30:59] then they no she just bailed off this
[1:31:01] thing said who is this man in the field
[1:31:03] I see coming and eleazer looks at her
[1:31:06] and says that's your
[1:31:11] lord and she veils
[1:31:14] herself out of respect for her new
[1:31:18] husband and she fails herself and she
[1:31:20] comes running up to Isaac and she comes
[1:31:23] rning running up to him and she says who
[1:31:26] are you my name is
[1:31:29] Rebecca I'm
[1:31:31] Isaac nice to meet
