[17:24] if you

[17:29] brother Caleb if you would open the
[17:32] Service in order to
[17:51] prayer amen uh children can be dismissed
[17:54] to Sunday
[17:56] school and uh turn with me if you if you
[17:59] will
[18:00] to Psalms
[18:21] 28 unto thee will I Cry Oh Lord my rock
[18:26] be not silent to me lest if thou th be
[18:29] silent to me I become like them that go
[18:33] down into the
[18:42] pit draw not draw me not away with the
[18:46] wicked and with the workers of iniquity
[18:49] which speak peace to their neighbors but
[18:52] Mischief is in their hearts
[19:06] because they regard not the works of the
[19:09] Lord nor the operation of his hands he
[19:13] shall destroy them and not build them
[19:22] up the Lord is my strength and my shield
[19:26] my heart trusted in him and and I am
[19:30] helped therefore my heart greatly
[19:33] rejoiceth and with my song will I praise
[19:42] him in this one together save thy people
[19:46] and bless thine inheritance feed them
[19:49] also and lift them
[19:53] forever Amen brother Brian you may be
[19:56] seated
[20:06] I promise not to
[20:10] fall morning Brothers
[20:14] ands I promise I'll try not to scream
[20:17] I'm not used to holding a mic if you
[20:19] would turn with me to uh Titus the first
[20:24] chapter I was uh you know I do that
[20:27] devotional
[20:30] the one you know that from spoken word
[20:32] every morning and U I was reading in in
[20:36] job this morning the second chapter this
[20:39] is what I'm saying the story I was the
[20:43] sometimes we miss the fact that when
[20:46] when job was in sackcloth and Ashes his
[20:49] friends before they even answered him or
[20:53] said anything to job they sat there for
[20:55] seven days in sa cloth and Ashes with
[20:58] job and I I was just thinking you know
[21:02] sometimes you really need to think about
[21:04] what you're going to say to somebody or
[21:07] what kind of idea you're going to hold
[21:08] to you really need to sit in prayer and
[21:10] be silent sometimes so God can really
[21:13] speak to you now later on in the book
[21:15] his friends were accusing him of secret
[21:17] sin but I was thinking they were willing
[21:19] to Humble themselves with their friend
[21:21] for seven days and DUS and Ashes and
[21:24] sackcloth just to be with their friend
[21:27] and to comfort him and I was just
[21:29] thinking how true is it for us this
[21:31] morning that sometimes someone just
[21:33] needs you to be a friend just needs you
[21:35] to be a comfort doesn't mean you have to
[21:38] say anything you just have to be there
[21:40] for them when they need you to be there
[21:42] for them and I I'm going to read from
[21:44] this first chapter I was listening a few
[21:46] messages this morning yeah I'm getting
[21:48] loud again but U I feel sorry for the
[21:50] people in the back but I I'll just read
[21:53] this chapter here and I was uh listening
[21:55] to that
[21:57] message uh from a different year but it
[22:00] it's the same convinced and concerned
[22:01] message that brother Bram preached so
[22:04] many years ago uh if you were born on
[22:07] that date you would be about 63 years
[22:09] old this morning but I'll just read it's
[22:12] not a lot of scriptures in this book
[22:15] this morning Paul a servant of God and
[22:17] an apostle of Jesus Christ according to
[22:19] the faith of God's elect and the
[22:22] acknowledgement of the truth which is
[22:24] after godliness you know there's a you
[22:28] can go quick but you could spend hours
[22:30] and days just taking senten and going
[22:33] back to your Bible finding other areas
[22:36] in the Bible that deal with that same
[22:37] subject in the hope of eternal life
[22:40] which God cannot lie promised before the
[22:43] world began but hath in due time
[22:45] manifest his word through preaching
[22:48] which is committed unto me according to
[22:49] the Commandments of God our savior you
[22:52] know that's really striking right there
[22:54] that one verse right there you know God
[22:57] shows through the foolish of and I'm not
[22:59] saying preaching but in the scriptures
[23:02] foolishness of preaching to speak to the
[23:05] world the world thinks it's crazy they
[23:07] think it's stupid they think it's
[23:08] arrogant but in the fact that's the very
[23:10] thing that's going to save your soul in
[23:12] your life and goes on to say to Titus my
[23:15] own son after the common Faith grace and
[23:18] mercy and peace from God the father and
[23:20] the Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior for
[23:23] this cause I left thee in cre that thou
[23:25] should have set in order the things that
[23:27] are wanting and ordain El Elders in
[23:30] every city that I had appointed
[23:32] thee as I'm I was reading this this
[23:35] morning and a few other places you know
[23:39] like brother Brandon was preaching in
[23:40] that message concern convinced un
[23:42] concerned you have to be convinced first
[23:46] uh before you like you said before you
[23:47] can be concerned you have to be
[23:49] convinced for the age that you live in
[23:52] that the word of God is right you have
[23:54] to be convinced that God has started a
[23:56] work in you and finished it this morning
[23:58] or you can't be concerned about anything
[24:01] because you don't have the foundation to
[24:03] start with and I hope I don't lose my PR
[24:05] Place Titus my own son after the common
[24:08] Faith grace and mercy and peace from God
[24:11] the father and the Lord Jesus Christ Our
[24:13] Savior for this cause I left thee in cre
[24:16] that thou should have said in order the
[24:18] things that are wanting to attain Elders
[24:20] in every city as I had appointed thee so
[24:23] Timothy and Titus and all them were
[24:25] doing exactly what Paul told them to do
[24:28] and it's no different for us we should
[24:30] be doing exactly what the message of the
[24:32] hour and the word of God tells us to do
[24:34] in our day and age and he goes on to say
[24:36] if any be blameless and the
[24:38] husband of one wife having faithful
[24:41] children nor accused of Riot or unruly
[24:43] I'm really thinking further down in the
[24:45] chapter for a bishop must be blameless
[24:48] as a steward of God not self-willed that
[24:50] goes against everything out there in the
[24:52] age that we live in not self-willed not
[24:55] soon angry not given to Wine no Striker
[24:58] not given to filthy lucer and you could
[25:01] when you think of the church World we're
[25:02] in right now you can look at those last
[25:05] two words there but a lover of
[25:07] hospitality a lover of Good Men sober
[25:09] just holy and
[25:11] temperate holding fast the faithful
[25:14] words as he ha been taught that he may
[25:16] be able by sound Doctrine both to exort
[25:19] and to convince the gain Slayer and I
[25:21] was thinking of that word to convince
[25:23] the only way you can convince the people
[25:25] that you intermingle with every day of
[25:27] your life
[25:29] you to convince them you have to be
[25:31] convinced yourself that what you believe
[25:33] is the truth and if you're not totally
[25:36] convinced what you believe this morning
[25:38] is the truth then when you get
[25:40] intermingling with other people you're
[25:42] not going to have the concern and you're
[25:44] not going to have the foundation you
[25:46] need to give them the truth that they
[25:48] need in that time and now I didn't I'm
[25:50] almost lost my place there for there are
[25:52] many unruly and vain talkers and
[25:54] deceivers especially they of
[25:56] circumcision
[25:58] whose mouths Must Be Stopped to subvert
[26:00] whole houses teaching things which they
[26:03] ought not and filthy lucer saved and I
[26:05] was when you look at that scripture this
[26:07] morning you know we're just talking
[26:10] Paul's day where they were just
[26:12] gossiping as they ran across each other
[26:14] through their cities or the country they
[26:17] had to see each other they physically
[26:18] had to go you know to do this but in our
[26:22] day and age you don't have to do that
[26:23] anymore you're you're all sitting there
[26:25] this morning with your smartphones able
[26:27] to do this you're able to destroy a
[26:29] man's life or a woman's life this
[26:31] morning with the very so phone you have
[26:34] sitting next to you and he goes on to
[26:36] say
[26:37] here I lost my place I keep saying that
[26:40] but holding fast the faithful words has
[26:42] been taught may be able by sound a both
[26:45] to exalt and to convince the gains
[26:47] Slayer for there are many unruly and
[26:49] vain talkers and deceivers especially
[26:52] they of circumcision whose mouths must
[26:54] be stop who subvert Soul houses I know I
[26:57] lost my place teaching things what they
[26:59] ought not to Filthy LC or Sake One of
[27:02] themselves even a prophet of their own
[27:03] said the cretans are always Liars evil
[27:06] beasts and slow bellies this witness is
[27:08] true wherefore rebuke them Sly that they
[27:11] may be sound in the faith not giving
[27:14] heed to Jewish fables and I'm looking at
[27:16] Jewish fables this morning you know the
[27:19] world is full of fables in our day and
[27:21] age the Commandments of man are turn
[27:23] from the truth unto the pure all things
[27:25] that are pure unto them that are the
[27:27] father and unbelieving and nothing pure
[27:30] but even their minds and conscience is
[27:32] defiled they possess that they know God
[27:35] but in their Works they deny him being
[27:38] abominable and disobedient unto every
[27:40] good work you know and you can take
[27:42] these scriptures this morning as you
[27:44] interact with the people in the world
[27:47] you everything we do has to be through
[27:50] the filter of God's word no matter what
[27:52] someone's telling you everything has to
[27:55] be taken through the filter of God's Ro
[27:57] you have to take what people tell you
[27:59] what you see them doing you have to take
[28:02] it through the filter of God's word and
[28:04] through and the most important thing
[28:06] that you can't leave out in that is you
[28:09] have to in everything that you do you
[28:11] have to use God's Divine love and how
[28:13] you deal with whatever those situations
[28:16] bring about in your life and as I was uh
[28:19] I don't want to move this mic because
[28:20] I'll be all over the place but I was
[28:23] thinking what brother brandham had to
[28:25] say I I was reading also the whole
[28:28] Gospel of
[28:29] John uh yesterday and I was thinking of
[28:32] the eighth and the ninth chapter I'm if
[28:34] I get to reading it I'll be here forever
[28:37] but in the eth chapter of John is where
[28:39] Jesus is dealing in the temple with the
[28:42] Pharisees and the
[28:43] Sadducees and they couldn't accept who
[28:46] Jesus Christ was they couldn't accept
[28:48] the fact that he was the son of God and
[28:51] that God was speaking to them through
[28:53] him they weren't convinced of who Jesus
[28:55] Christ was and he was constantly
[28:57] struggling going with them in the eth
[28:59] chapter and I'm just going to I know I
[29:01] said something I'm going to do the total
[29:04] opposite this morning but in this eighth
[29:07] chapter of John I'll just read what he
[29:09] had to say here these few scriptures
[29:12] here and they and everyone knows that
[29:16] they they answered and said unto him
[29:18] Abraham is our father Jesus said unto
[29:20] them if you were Abraham's children you
[29:23] would do the works of Abraham and it's
[29:25] no different for us this morning you all
[29:27] know who Jesus Christ was this morning
[29:29] you have his very word if that's in you
[29:32] you're going to do those very works just
[29:34] like he's telling them if they really
[29:36] knew Abraham they would do what Abraham
[29:38] did but you now seek to kill me a man
[29:40] that hath told you the truth which I
[29:43] have heard of God this did not Abraham
[29:46] you do the Deeds of your fathers they
[29:49] said then said they to him we be not
[29:52] born of fornication we have one father
[29:54] even God Jesus said unto them if you
[29:59] if God were your father you would love
[30:01] me and for I proceede forth and came
[30:03] from God neither came I of myself and he
[30:06] that sent me while you you not
[30:08] understand my speech even the words you
[30:10] cannot hear my words you be of your
[30:14] father the devil and the lust of your
[30:15] fathers you will do he was a murderer
[30:18] from the beginning Abode not in the
[30:20] truth because there's no truth in him
[30:22] when he spoke he spoke he
[30:25] speaketh when he speaketh a lie and he
[30:27] speaketh
[30:28] of his own for he is a liar and the
[30:30] father of all because I tell you the
[30:32] truth you believe me not and then he
[30:34] goes to say the same thing to them which
[30:37] of you can convince convince me of sin I
[30:41] say the truth why do you not believe me
[30:43] and he he said use that same word here
[30:46] they couldn't they weren't convinced
[30:48] that Jesus Christ who he said it was and
[30:51] I'll just read read this here but I was
[30:54] I just wrote down some bullets from that
[30:56] message that I was listening into what
[30:58] brother brandham had to say you know
[31:01] these are just some ideas not ideas
[31:03] things he said that if you're convinced
[31:06] you'll believe these things number one
[31:08] if you're convinced you'll believe the
[31:10] Bible is the word of God and it's the
[31:12] truth that you won't be wavering back
[31:14] and forth you'll actually believe that
[31:16] the Bible and the scriptures are the
[31:18] word of God and this and you'll you're
[31:21] convinced and you believe that the holy
[31:24] spirit is for you this day and that you
[31:26] can be baptized and full of of it this
[31:28] morning and you'll believe that God
[31:31] heals you'll be convinced you you won't
[31:33] doubt it anymore he went on to say you
[31:36] believe that this message what we
[31:38] believe is a message to the last Church
[31:41] of Gentile Church age you believe that
[31:44] you won't you won't waver in that belief
[31:47] and you'll hear what the word for the
[31:49] hour and the most important thing he
[31:51] kept saying time and time again and
[31:55] you'll believe that Jesus Christ is the
[31:57] same yesterday today and forever no
[31:59] matter what your friends tell you no
[32:01] matter what the people out in the world
[32:02] say about it you'll honestly and
[32:04] truthfully believe that Jesus Christ is
[32:06] the same yesterday today and forever and
[32:09] everything you do in life everything
[32:11] that you believe will be based on that
[32:13] simple principle this morning and I'll
[32:16] just read I I don't want to I'll just
[32:19] read I know I'm one of those kind of
[32:21] fellas that says a lot in a few minutes
[32:23] but I'll uh just read this last part of
[32:25] this quote this morning and uh if I can
[32:29] find a good place to jump into it it
[32:36] says yeah I'll start right about here
[32:38] all of them want to look like one
[32:40] another and he's basically saying
[32:43] everyone wants to be like his neighbor
[32:45] everyone wants to be you know a son
[32:48] wants to be like his father there's
[32:49] nothing wrong about it a mother uh a
[32:52] daughter wants to be like his mother if
[32:54] those are good things everyone wants to
[32:56] copy everyone but but we only want to
[32:58] copy the True Image and that image is
[33:01] Jesus Christ but I'll I'll just read all
[33:04] of them want to look like one another
[33:06] it's matching time you know that's true
[33:09] it's a matching time amen I'm not going
[33:11] to tell you my brother I don't care
[33:13] whether my shoes my match my trousers or
[33:16] my trousers match my coat I want my
[33:19] experience to match God's Bible and
[33:22] that's the matching time and that's what
[33:24] I'm trying to say this morning that we
[33:26] have to match the art experience has to
[33:28] match the word of God for the hour that
[33:30] we live in and he goes on to say here if
[33:33] you want to match something match your
[33:35] experience against fals you know a lot
[33:37] of people talk about the message how
[33:39] we're following a man you know brother
[33:42] Bram always P pointed back to Paul he he
[33:45] wasn't afraid to tell that we needed to
[33:47] do like Paul did he even says that right
[33:50] here and he goes on match your
[33:52] experience against Paul and that and
[33:54] Paul's experience is brother Brown's
[33:56] experience it's not hard to believe amen
[33:59] that's what we need today it's a
[34:00] matching time with Paul's faith in the
[34:02] Bible that's our example right the real
[34:05] matching time don't try to match your
[34:07] neighbor match some of the Saints of the
[34:09] Bible so he's giving you an example here
[34:12] you should mimic the examples in God's
[34:15] word that's what you should be mimicking
[34:17] not the crazy stuff that's out there in
[34:19] the world and he goes on to say I don't
[34:22] want to re don't try to match your
[34:24] neighbor match some of the Saints of the
[34:25] Bible if you're a saint a like a saint
[34:28] walk like a saint dress like a saint
[34:30] talk like a saint pray like a saint
[34:32] believe like a saint dress like a saint
[34:35] be a saint you know but basically what
[34:37] is saying you can't manufacture these
[34:40] things they have to come from the inside
[34:43] out if you're trying to manufacture
[34:45] these things there'll come a day when
[34:47] you're that experience will run up
[34:49] against something if you're
[34:51] manufacturing it won't hold that day so
[34:54] it's got to come from the inside out
[34:56] just like a plant grows from the inside
[34:58] out it's the same way here but the the
[35:01] seed and the plant have to be the same
[35:03] in the end and you go saying walk like a
[35:06] saint dress like a saint talk like a
[35:08] saint pray like a saint believe like a
[35:10] saint dress like a saint be like a saint
[35:13] live like a saint die like a saint and
[35:17] as we get older that that means that's
[35:19] more important to me this morning than
[35:21] it was 20 years ago and go to heaven
[35:23] like a saint amen and if I said would
[35:26] say anything
[35:29] the most important thing as this year
[35:31] goes on I you know being sat down for
[35:34] the last three or four months of this
[35:37] last surgery I would say that as I see
[35:39] the world how crazy as it
[35:41] is if you're a real saint of God or a
[35:44] real Christian it should get you closer
[35:47] to the Bible and to the word of God it
[35:49] should drive you even closer shouldn't
[35:51] drive you further away it should drive
[35:53] you into the hands of Jesus Christ into
[35:56] the love of God not far from it and like
[35:59] I said anytime you come up against a
[36:02] struggle or something that's hard in
[36:03] your life if you truly got God's
[36:06] experience I'm not saying it's going to
[36:08] be easy but you got all the tools you
[36:10] need to be successful in whatever that
[36:12] situation is this morning brother David
[36:16] I need turn this
[36:23] off amen you love the Lord this
[36:26] morning amen let's stand if we could

[57:35] together and I'm getting older and I
[57:37] forget and I get in a hurry and I'm
[57:39] horrible when I get in a
[57:42] hurry and me and the hood collided and
[57:45] the hood got the better half and and I
[57:48] have a real expensive tool and I left it
[57:52] on my trailer and I was driving down the
[57:53] road it's about a $900 tool and it fell
[57:57] off and I didn't realize it till that
[57:59] afternoon till I needed it and it was
[58:02] gone and the first word out of my mouth
[58:05] was dummy
[58:06] David you have got to slow down and my
[58:09] wife has told me she said you got to
[58:10] slow down honey you're G to kill
[58:12] yourself and just been so busy and had
[58:15] so many things going on and I thought
[58:18] well
[58:20] Lord I hate to the thinking in my mind
[58:23] now is I hate to waste the money you've
[58:25] given me but I I can I guess I'll buy
[58:27] another one because I need it and and I
[58:30] stopped in at a place and a friend of
[58:33] mine he said hey buddy did you lose
[58:39] this
[58:43] [Applause]
[58:47] and there was that
[58:49] tool but you
[58:51] know the socket had fell off of it and I
[58:54] thought well that's no big deal we can
[58:56] handle
[58:58] that the next time I was at a place and
[59:01] where it was at I lost it I stepped out
[59:03] and guess what I stepped on the
[59:08] socket and I said
[59:13] Lord forgive me for being slowful and
[59:16] not being
[59:18] thankful I said because lord I can't
[59:21] even walk I can't even do anything
[59:23] anymore without you helping me and you
[59:27] know you know they always say we we need
[59:30] the honest confession and I always
[59:32] thought I could do anything but you know
[59:35] what I found out now I need him more
[59:37] every day every step of the way and this
[59:41] guy here and we went and ate at Cracker
[59:43] Barrel the other night me and Janet and
[59:45] we had a young waitress she's 19 years
[59:48] old and I don't know how we got on
[59:50] talking about God but we did and she
[59:54] began to tell me that she was a
[59:56] Christian and she began to tell us that
[1:00:00] she was realizing that she couldn't stay
[1:00:02] with her friends in the world she was
[1:00:04] having to give her life to God she was
[1:00:08] having to pray more and she was having
[1:00:09] to she said when I read my Bible she
[1:00:12] said it just don't work you can't do
[1:00:15] both and you know we begin to talk to
[1:00:17] her and just tell her about the things
[1:00:21] of the Lord and talk to her she said

[1:00:31] many times but we've never had the
[1:00:33] awesome service that we had from her and

[1:00:44] their heart and life and I don't know
[1:00:46] what kind of church she goes to but you
[1:00:47] know what she was a light to me because
[1:00:50] I thought she didn't mind speaking about
[1:00:53] what God had done in her heart so we
[1:00:56] told her about mom and her wreck and she
[1:00:58] said well let me show you my picture of

[1:15:44] we surrender ourselves to you now I ask
[1:15:45] him God that you'd use us now in Jesus
[1:15:48] name amen and amen open your bibles if
[1:15:52] you will to book of First Corinthians
[1:16:04] amen First
[1:16:09] Corinthians
[1:16:11] 13 First Corinthians
[1:16:19] 13 and we want to read verse
[1:16:22] 13 now abideth faith hope and charity
[1:16:28] the three but the greatest of these is
[1:16:31] Charity may God add His blessings to the
[1:16:33] reading of the word you can be seated
[1:16:36] amen we want to take our time today is
[1:16:38] that okay since we just do to one
[1:16:41] service I think if we do a service in a
[1:16:43] half that'll be about right amen so
[1:16:45] praise the Lord let's not be in a hurry
[1:16:47] because amen we just want to take our
[1:16:49] time in this so we see here that Paul of
[1:16:53] course talking whenever he was talking
[1:16:55] about gifts of tongues and and and Faith
[1:16:58] to move mountains and all these other
[1:17:00] things that he spoke to us and let us
[1:17:02] know that of all these three main
[1:17:06] ingredients in our lives charity of
[1:17:09] course was the greatest isn't that right
[1:17:12] amen and he mentions faith and he puts
[1:17:16] hope in there puts hope in there amen
[1:17:20] and that's what we want to dwell on for
[1:17:21] a while this morning amen now how many
[1:17:24] knows there is a different between Faith
[1:17:26] and
[1:17:27] Hope amen Faith and Hope there's a
[1:17:30] little bit of a difference there amen we
[1:17:32] know that whenever uh uh
[1:17:36] whenever you're given faith faith is
[1:17:39] something that has muscles and it makes
[1:17:41] it so isin't that right it I forget just
[1:17:44] the exact quote but he said it that
[1:17:46] faith comes and it tramps down it brings
[1:17:49] into submission the enemy it makes it so
[1:17:52] and if you genuinely have faith you
[1:17:55] don't have a hope it's not a hope
[1:17:57] anymore it's it's something more than
[1:17:59] that amen amen if you have a real
[1:18:01] Revelation amen of God of course we know
[1:18:03] that's what fa fa real genuine faith is
[1:18:06] is something that God has revealed to
[1:18:08] you a't that right like uh uh Jesus said
[1:18:11] to Peter who do men say that I the son
[1:18:13] of man am he said Thou Art the Christ
[1:18:15] the son of the Living God and he says
[1:18:17] you know flesh and blood is not revealed
[1:18:19] this to you but my Father which is in
[1:18:21] heaven ain't that right he our our Peter
[1:18:24] and Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[1:18:27] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:18:30] against it I want to take you to a
[1:18:32] scripture that kind of pretty much
[1:18:34] brings it to the same level of uh of uh
[1:18:38] strength that hope is brought to the
[1:18:41] same amount of strength as what this
[1:18:43] scripture about this Rock Amen is and
[1:18:46] I'll take you to the scripture for that
[1:18:48] because it's kind of hard for us to
[1:18:49] Fathom amen that Faith or hope would be
[1:18:53] that power F ain't that right hope hope
[1:18:57] whether you know it or not is very
[1:18:59] powerful now in some situations some
[1:19:02] circumstances amen I believe even the
[1:19:03] prophet made the quote it mentioned
[1:19:05] about how that sometimes hope can be
[1:19:07] your biggest enemy amen because there's
[1:19:09] some things that you don't want to hope
[1:19:11] for but that you want to have faith for
[1:19:13] that you want to believe amen I want to
[1:19:16] say something else about hope I believe
[1:19:17] that uh hope Amen to me hope means
[1:19:22] possibility amen it brings
[1:19:25] possibility amen amen and so uh as I was
[1:19:30] saying faith it makes it so I believe
[1:19:32] brother Bram said you know if God
[1:19:33] revealed to me that God was going to
[1:19:35] raise Abraham Lincoln up is that what he
[1:19:37] used either Abraham or George Washington
[1:19:40] I believe it was Abraham Lincoln if God
[1:19:42] revealed he's going to ra he would
[1:19:43] invite the whole world to come and
[1:19:46] watch how many know when there is
[1:19:48] something revealed when it's thus sayith
[1:19:50] the Lord you never had to wonder about
[1:19:53] that anymore there's no no question
[1:19:55] whatsoever on that amen but we're we're
[1:19:59] going to dwell in the areas of times
[1:20:01] perhaps that amen you're not sure of
[1:20:04] something and and and another great s a
[1:20:08] great thought and a great subject that
[1:20:10] would be good to take would be
[1:20:13] trust amen how many know trust is
[1:20:16] another another level also it's when
[1:20:19] amen I believe there's a song he says
[1:20:20] when you can't see God's hand trust his
[1:20:23] heart amen amen some sometimes all you
[1:20:25] can do is trust amen I remember talking
[1:20:28] to brother Donnie and talking about his
[1:20:30] daughter and all the faith that people
[1:20:31] have had to try to you know believe for
[1:20:33] her healing and oh my almost prophecies
[1:20:36] given on her healing and so forth yet in
[1:20:38] it all God still takes her amen and so
[1:20:42] we were speaking tonight and I thought
[1:20:44] you know sometimes you just have to
[1:20:45] trust and and he said that's exactly
[1:20:48] right because that's where he was at he
[1:20:50] says you know when you don't understand
[1:20:51] why you don't understand why he's not
[1:20:53] doing it or whatever ever then you trust
[1:20:56] that he's got it in control you trust
[1:20:59] God amen amen and of course many many
[1:21:02] things in the Old Testament amen blessed
[1:21:05] is he that trusteth in the Lord is that
[1:21:06] right anybody that trusts in the Lord is
[1:21:09] a blessed person amen and so sometimes
[1:21:12] that what we have it's it's in the in
[1:21:14] the areas of sometimes we're not sure
[1:21:16] about we like sure we like preach on
[1:21:19] faith we like to preach on charity but I
[1:21:21] think it's also necessary that we preach
[1:21:23] on this hope amen praise the
[1:21:28] Lord amen it just comes to
[1:21:32] mind uh where it says there's one Lord
[1:21:35] One Faith one hope one baptism is't that
[1:21:37] right there's one hope amen but Brandon
[1:21:40] makes a statement he says you know he
[1:21:42] says there's not one thing left my
[1:21:45] Christian friend but the coming of the
[1:21:47] Lord Jesus that's the only hope that the
[1:21:51] church has
[1:21:55] amen that the church has that the
[1:21:58] believer has how many of know that's the
[1:22:01] only hope that you
[1:22:03] got is the coming of the Lord how many
[1:22:05] beli the Rapture is the only way
[1:22:08] out the only way out is the rapture it's
[1:22:10] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:22:12] the only hope for the
[1:22:15] church amen so how many believes we need
[1:22:17] to grab a hold of that hope amen amen
[1:22:21] and really lay hands on it so to speak
[1:22:24] amen amen praise the
[1:22:26] Lord let me uh share with you amen and I
[1:22:30] want to read different scriptures to
[1:22:31] kind of lay a foundation but let's go to
[1:22:34] um Hebrews I want to turn to
[1:22:36] Hebrews and take you and show you uh the
[1:22:42] stability of this anchor that we have in
[1:22:46] the book of Hebrews I believe it is the
[1:22:48] six
[1:22:49] chapter amen and Hebrews 6 and verse 11
[1:22:53] it says and we desire that
[1:22:58] everyone every one of you do show the
[1:23:01] same diligence to the full Assurance of
[1:23:05] Hope unto the end that you be not
[1:23:09] slothful but followers of them who
[1:23:11] through faith and patience inherit the
[1:23:15] promises amen how many believes that
[1:23:19] sometimes when you don't see what's
[1:23:20] going on when you don't understand then
[1:23:22] it takes patience amen amen now notice
[1:23:26] in verse
[1:23:27] 18 Amen in verse 18 that by two
[1:23:31] immutable things in which it was
[1:23:33] impossible for God to lie we might have
[1:23:36] strong
[1:23:38] consolation who have fled for Refuge to
[1:23:42] lay hold upon the hope that is set
[1:23:45] before us which hope we have remember I
[1:23:49] said that he on the same level now as
[1:23:51] this Revelation here he says which hope
[1:23:53] we have have as an anchor of the
[1:24:01] Soul
[1:24:02] wow now we find that this anchor this fa
[1:24:06] this hope that we have it's an anchor of
[1:24:09] the Soul both sure and steadfast and
[1:24:13] which entereth into that within the
[1:24:17] veil amen how many knows that song be
[1:24:19] very sure be very sure that your Anchor
[1:24:23] Holds and grips the Solid
[1:24:28] Rock Amen it grips that
[1:24:32] Solid
[1:24:34] Rock Romans
[1:24:39] 15 I've got a lot of scriptures here so
[1:24:42] and I y'all pray for me I want to get to
[1:24:44] where I can maybe get this somehow all
[1:24:47] just lined up and we won't have to have
[1:24:50] as much time going from one to the other
[1:24:54] amen 15 Romans
[1:25:06] 15 Romans 15 and13 says now the god of
[1:25:12] Hope amen the god of Hope remember we
[1:25:16] talked about how that God has attributes
[1:25:19] how him was to be father and him was to
[1:25:22] be savior now we find coming another
[1:25:26] another uh uh light another rainbow so
[1:25:29] to speak or something else that's
[1:25:31] flooding out is the god of Hope because
[1:25:33] how many knows that with whoever God is
[1:25:36] there's always
[1:25:40] hope amen the god of Hope fill you with
[1:25:44] joy and peace in believing that you may
[1:25:49] abound in
[1:25:51] Hope Paul talked a lot about hope
[1:25:54] through the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:57] verse four of chapter 15 says for
[1:25:59] whatsoever things were written before
[1:26:02] now notice how many know faith comes by
[1:26:03] hearing is't that right now it talks
[1:26:06] about for whatsoever things were written
[1:26:08] before time were written for our
[1:26:10] learning that we through patience and
[1:26:13] comfort of the scriptures might have
[1:26:17] hope how many believe that hope is a
[1:26:20] very very powerful thing
[1:26:24] yes it is amen it's like the light at
[1:26:28] the end of a tunnel amen remember over
[1:26:31] there in uh 1 John 3 and verse three it
[1:26:35] says and every man but let me go back
[1:26:37] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[1:26:40] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:26:42] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:26:45] shall be like him talking about sporn
[1:26:48] again Sons and Daughters of God Amen for
[1:26:51] we shall see him as he is and every man
[1:26:54] that have this
[1:26:57] hope in him purify himself even as he is
[1:27:02] pure so this hope amen that we have of
[1:27:05] seeing him and being like him and having
[1:27:08] a body like it to his own
[1:27:11] body how many believes that's for us
[1:27:15] amen we're going to have a body like his
[1:27:16] own body amen and we have this hope in
[1:27:20] them in that then we purify ourselves
[1:27:23] from the inside out man that hath this
[1:27:26] hope purifieth himself even as he is
[1:27:32] pure praise the
[1:27:38] Lord all right let's look at another one
[1:27:42] another one of what hope
[1:27:44] is in Romans
[1:27:47] 8 Romans 8 verse4 24 I'll just mention
[1:27:52] this here before as you're turning there
[1:27:55] it says for we are saved by
[1:27:59] hope don't hear that much do you we're
[1:28:03] saved by
[1:28:05] hope
[1:28:08] amen when I think of hope I think of the
[1:28:11] Concentration
[1:28:12] Camp Amen in Germany is't that right and
[1:28:17] word gets into this concentration camp
[1:28:20] that the Allies have landed is that
[1:28:23] right right they're heading this
[1:28:28] way now I don't know about you but they
[1:28:30] would have probably had to had to calm
[1:28:33] down a little bit not get too excited
[1:28:36] because when they were watching all of
[1:28:38] their friends and their relatives going
[1:28:40] to the gas chamber and they know they
[1:28:42] were dying little by little amen when
[1:28:44] they just hear that it gave them
[1:28:48] hope and with that hope comes great
[1:28:51] enthusiasm
[1:28:54] how many knows that's what God is that's
[1:28:57] what you have that's what I have we have
[1:29:04] God Amen the great is the mystery of God
[1:29:08] Amen it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:29:12] glory how many knows it's Christ in you
[1:29:16] that is your hope of ever amen seeing
[1:29:20] heaven or having the Rapture or having
[1:29:23] the body change it's Christ in you the
[1:29:26] hope of
[1:29:29] glory
[1:29:34] amen amen there old stuff wants to try
[1:29:37] to hang on into my
[1:29:39] chest amen but praise the Lord There's
[1:29:43] Hope praise the
[1:29:45] Lord so now notice this is not really
[1:29:47] the what I want to go to but let's let's
[1:29:49] go back here amen and look at uh Verse
[1:29:53] 18 of of chapter 8 for I reckon that the
[1:29:56] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:29:59] be worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:30:01] which shall be revealed in us for the
[1:30:03] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:30:05] waiteth for the manifestations of the
[1:30:08] sons of God for the creature was made
[1:30:10] sub to vanity not willingly but by
[1:30:14] reason of him who has subjected the same
[1:30:18] in
[1:30:19] Hope amen how many know the very one
[1:30:22] that allowed us to go into sin and Deery
[1:30:25] amen whenever he put a word in there he
[1:30:28] says you know that he was going to
[1:30:29] redeem Adam isin't that right that he's
[1:30:32] going to bring it
[1:30:33] back so he allowed us to get into that
[1:30:36] condition all of humanity but he also
[1:30:38] subjected the same in
[1:30:42] Hope
[1:30:45] amen amen I said knew it would be a
[1:30:47] little different this
[1:30:51] morning but I when I can't when it came
[1:30:54] to me when I thought about
[1:30:56] this I thought about no
[1:30:59] matter as
[1:31:01] long as Christ is on The Mercy
[1:31:03] Seat is that
[1:31:06] right as long as Christ is on The Mercy
[1:31:09] Seat There's
[1:31:12] Hope the whole world you and I are we we
[1:31:15] we have we have laid hold on this hope
[1:31:18] we've accepted this hope we have it in
[1:31:20] our hearts do you realize before you can
[1:31:23] have hope
[1:31:24] that has to be placed down in your heart
[1:31:28] is that
[1:31:29] right no matter what your condition is
[1:31:32] no matter what your situation is if you
[1:31:35] don't believe there's any
[1:31:37] hope it is a sad
[1:31:41] situation what was the word that I was
[1:31:44] looking for amen I forget just what it
[1:31:46] was but despair
[1:31:49] perhaps if you don't have hope it's
[1:31:51] nothing but despair
[1:31:54] amen uh the dictionary of it was the
[1:31:58] definition of uh uh no hope and so forth
[1:32:01] was was was really really bad like uh
[1:32:05] condemned judged no way amen and do you
[1:32:09] realize the whole world today well let
[1:32:12] me just let me read you a scripture here
[1:32:13] one more scripture here in Ephesians 2
[1:32:16] and I believe it was
[1:32:18] 12 it says that at that time you were
[1:32:23] without Christ being aliens from the
[1:32:25] Commonwealth of Israel strangers from
[1:32:29] the Covenant of Promise having no
[1:32:33] hope no hope and without God in the
[1:32:38] world now how many knows if you haven't
[1:32:40] got God you don't have any
[1:32:45] hope how how many glad that you've got
[1:32:49] God at one time you guys we all were
[1:32:52] without hope we had no
[1:32:57] hope how many knows that's the condition
[1:32:59] that the people are out there they
[1:33:01] believe they come from monkeys they
[1:33:03] don't believe they have any
[1:33:06] hope what a world to live in what a
[1:33:11] terrible state to be in to have no
[1:33:14] hope but the very reason that you got
[1:33:17] saved is because a man when you heard
[1:33:19] the gospel it gave you hope that if
[1:33:22] you'll believe in him you'll not perish
[1:33:24] but have everlasting life he is our
[1:33:29] hope Amen Brother David I don't know if

[1:33:54] Jesus blood and righteousness when all
[1:33:57] around my soul gives way he then is All
[1:34:00] My Hope and stay how many believes that
[1:34:04] it don't matter what comes it don't
[1:34:06] matter what goes he is my
[1:34:10] hope so we were without God we were
[1:34:13] without hope and so is the world out
[1:34:16] there living in a world without hope no
[1:34:20] wonder they tattoo themselves no wonder
[1:34:23] they Pier themselves no wonder they turn
[1:34:25] from males to females and from females
[1:34:27] to males and are completely confused
[1:34:30] they're in a loss world without
[1:34:35] hope but you know what the truth of it
[1:34:37] is there is hope for it I me believe
[1:34:41] there is hope for him I'm here to
[1:34:43] declare that there is hope for him but
[1:34:46] if you don't believe there's hope for
[1:34:48] you it'll take God to come down and give
[1:34:51] you a glimpse of that hope say Hey you
[1:34:54] know maybe there is
[1:34:59] hope that's the beginning that's the
[1:35:02] beginning of a great thing when you can
[1:35:04] believe hey maybe there is hope cuz God
[1:35:07] allows us to get into all kinds of
[1:35:10] conditions and I want to give you some
[1:35:11] examples here later on with the help of
[1:35:13] the Lord of different people who had no
[1:35:15] hope but yet God let put something down
[1:35:17] in there to give them
[1:35:20] hope it takes the grace and mercy of God
[1:35:23] to let you know hey there is
[1:35:27] hope there's light in the
[1:35:30] darkness There's Hope for the
[1:35:33] Hopeless
[1:35:35] amen God is the god of the impossible
[1:35:39] made possible how many believe
[1:35:42] that
[1:35:43] amen when we were without
[1:35:46] hope God died for us amen and brought us
[1:35:50] and gave us hope when I think about
[1:35:51] where I was in the world not looking for
[1:35:54] God my I'm so glad that I don't believe
[1:35:58] that we came from monkeys and that we're
[1:35:59] just another animal being no
[1:36:03] amen all right let me lay a little more
[1:36:05] before we go on to some of this let's go
[1:36:07] to
[1:36:09] Psalms in
[1:36:11] Psalms 33 verse 16 says there is no King
[1:36:16] Sav by the multitude of an hosts a
[1:36:19] mighty man is not delivered by much
[1:36:22] strength a horse is a vain thing for
[1:36:25] safety and neither shall he deliver any
[1:36:27] out of his great strength behold the eye
[1:36:29] of the Lord is upon them that fear Him
[1:36:32] and upon them that hope in his Mercy how
[1:36:37] many believes that when you have hope
[1:36:39] and when you hope in God God blesses you
[1:36:42] for
[1:36:46] that amen how are you going to get out
[1:36:49] of your situation well I'm trusting in
[1:36:52] the Lord My Hope is in the Lord that God
[1:36:55] will deliver me don't know if he will or
[1:37:03] not I never finished
[1:37:07] Romans for ye are saved by hope but hope
[1:37:11] that is seen is not
[1:37:13] hope amen how many believe that whenever
[1:37:16] you're hoping for something and all of a
[1:37:18] sudden that materializes it's not hope
[1:37:20] anymore it's here now
[1:37:24] amen for what a man seeth why does he
[1:37:28] yet hope for
[1:37:30] it
[1:37:31] amen we were saved by hope hope brought
[1:37:34] us to salvation but now that we have
[1:37:37] salvation you don't have to hope
[1:37:41] anymore why because now you know that
[1:37:43] you're are God because of the spirit
[1:37:45] that he has given to you one place the
[1:37:48] scripture says if we only have hope in
[1:37:50] Christ Jesus in this life we're of all
[1:37:52] men most risk
[1:37:54] well are you saved well I hope so you
[1:37:56] better be a little bit more sure than
[1:37:58] that you better know that you that you
[1:38:00] know that you got the holy ghost that
[1:38:02] you're one of
[1:38:04] gods have you got the Holy Ghost I hope
[1:38:06] so oh my kind of a dangerous place to be
[1:38:09] ain't it better go a little further than
[1:38:12] that
[1:38:14] amen so now notice the eyes of the Lord
[1:38:18] are those that help in his Mercy to
[1:38:20] deliver their soul from death and to
[1:38:22] keep them alive in
[1:38:25] famine ourth for the Lord he is our help
[1:38:29] and our shield for our heart shall
[1:38:32] rejoice in him because we have trusted
[1:38:34] in His holy name let thy mercy oh Lord
[1:38:37] be upon us
[1:38:39] according as we hope in thee or we could
[1:38:45] say trust in thee can y'all see the the
[1:38:49] significance between trust and hope
[1:38:52] you're just trusting him you're
[1:38:54] believing God is going to do
[1:38:59] it
[1:39:01] amen Romans
[1:39:04] 4 4 and verse
[1:39:07] 17 it's written I have made thee a
[1:39:10] father of many nations before whom
[1:39:13] before him whom he believed even God
[1:39:15] talking about Abraham who Quicken us to
[1:39:17] dead and call us those things which be
[1:39:20] not as though they were now how many

[1:39:26] the things that are not as though they
[1:39:29] were you believe that listen to the next
[1:39:32] verse Abraham who against hope believed
[1:39:37] in
[1:39:40] Hope W the S my the situation looks
[1:39:46] hopeless but I believe it
[1:39:49] anyway how many believes against hope

[1:39:54] hope God can do it God is
[1:39:59] able oh my I thought about it listen to

[1:42:18] burn God will deliver us then had a
[1:42:22] revelation but they said we don't know
[1:42:24] whether he will but this one thing we

[1:44:31] Lord and God loves that how many knows
[1:44:34] God loves to see that he loved it in the
[1:44:37] three Hebrew
[1:44:38] children they didn't know but we're
[1:44:40] going to do it
[1:44:43] anyway

[1:44:51] says this is still the way I want to
[1:44:53] live this is still the best Life to
[1:44:56] Live why because he had the peace of God
[1:44:59] in his heart he had the love of God in
[1:45:01] his heart he had a smile on his face he
[1:45:03] had joy in his heart what better way to

[1:45:08] joy people want peace people want a
[1:45:12] clear
[1:45:13] conscience they go all about it the
[1:45:15] wrong way but it's there there's still
[1:45:18] hope for the
[1:45:19] world if they'll just accept it
[1:45:24] but there'll come a time according to
[1:45:25] the scriptures he says they'll call on
[1:45:27] me and I won't answer amen isin't that
[1:45:30] right they'll seek me early they'll want

[1:46:07] streets over he began to cry out amen he
[1:46:10] believed in that hope and it did

[1:49:15] that we'll just give him some
[1:49:17] Glory Lamentations
[1:49:20] Ezekiel 37
[1:49:23] Ezekiel
[1:49:25] 37 verse one it says and the Hand of the
[1:49:27] Lord was upon me and carried me out in
[1:49:29] the spirit of the Lord and set me down
[1:49:31] in the midst of the valley that was full
[1:49:34] of Bones how many knows brother Braham
[1:49:37] talking about how that you know the
[1:49:39] church has gotten to where it was such
[1:49:41] in Dark Ages down am mean in the Middle
[1:49:44] Ages 1400s and so forth it was so dark
[1:49:47] and so dead and so spiritually dead that
[1:49:50] there needed to be a resurrection of
[1:49:52] Jesus Christ coming up out of the Dark
[1:49:54] Ages ain't that right amen and to ra can
[1:49:57] these bones live now notice in verse 11
[1:50:00] I won't read you all of that we're not
[1:50:01] going to go all down there but y'all
[1:50:03] remember the story of the dry bones how
[1:50:04] he prophesied and and and caused the
[1:50:07] bones to come to together caus the skin
[1:50:10] to come or flesh to come together come
[1:50:12] the the the skin to come upon the flesh
[1:50:15] brought it all together but if you'll
[1:50:17] notice he said unto me in verse 11 son
[1:50:20] of man these bones are the whole house
[1:50:22] of Israel behold they say our bones are
[1:50:25] dried and our hope is lost we are cut
[1:50:28] off from our parts in other words they
[1:50:30] said they thought that all hope was
[1:50:35] gone all hope let's admit it looking at
[1:50:39] that valley of dry bones it would have
[1:50:41] looked like no there's not a
[1:50:43] chance but how many knows wherever God
[1:50:46] is there's always a chance there's
[1:50:48] always hope where God
[1:50:51] is boy if you don't hear nothing else in
[1:50:53] your mind tomorrow remember that
[1:50:55] wherever God is there's always
[1:50:59] hope we know that brother mam said
[1:51:01] beyond the regions of the lost or
[1:51:02] whenever you go from this world and you
[1:51:04] go out into the other world he says
[1:51:06] there's no hope for salvation over there
[1:51:09] this is your chance this is your hope
[1:51:11] now not only did he say that but many
[1:51:14] times in his altar calls he said you
[1:51:16] know tomorrow you may not you may be
[1:51:19] over there tomorrow you have no chance
[1:51:21] no promise of alive tomorrow none of us
[1:51:24] do here that's why you have to take
[1:51:26] advantage of that hope you have to take
[1:51:28] advantage of the privilege of God God
[1:51:30] has given you
[1:51:32] today not put it off some other day
[1:51:35] don't say well I'll do it another time
[1:51:37] you might not have and then you'll never
[1:51:39] have any chance there won't be a chance
[1:51:42] when you take that last breath this is
[1:51:44] your chance this is your hope now is the
[1:51:48] time I don't care where we are we as
[1:51:51] Christians you see well I'm not what I
[1:51:52] want to be well don't wait till tomorrow
[1:51:54] see God I want to change today I want
[1:51:57] more of you this
[1:51:59] morning now is the day of
[1:52:02] salvation cuz tomorrow it could be you
[1:52:04] could be in a world of no hope not a
[1:52:08] chance anymore even Jesus went and
[1:52:11] preached to the souls that were in
[1:52:12] prison they had no hope no chance of
[1:52:15] Salvation And yet he went and preached
[1:52:17] to
[1:52:19] them how many knows that old Israel all
[1:52:22] of the the Old Testament it talked about
[1:52:23] a savior coming talking about a
[1:52:25] deliverer talking about amen a redeemer
[1:52:29] coming ain't that right amen when he
[1:52:32] came in the person of Jesus Christ amen
[1:52:34] and they crucified him and he went to
[1:52:36] the and went into the grave amen the sun
[1:52:39] refused to shine amen went down in the
[1:52:42] middle of the day amen it looked like
[1:52:44] everything was lost it was a dark hour
[1:52:48] all the disciples had scattered the
[1:52:49] church was completely scattered it was a
[1:52:53] dark hour they were discouraged but then
[1:52:56] what happened on Easter morning when
[1:52:58] that sun came up amen Hope Has
[1:53:03] Arrived hope
[1:53:05] Rose the baptism of the Holy Ghost was
[1:53:08] going to come salvation had come
[1:53:10] Redemption had come Joy had come and I'm
[1:53:14] here to tell you when you get hope in
[1:53:15] your life you get joy unspeakable and
[1:53:18] full of
[1:53:19] Glory that's what hope does
[1:53:24] in the darkest
[1:53:25] hour all was lost the Bible says if no
[1:53:29] one's worthy to take that book no one's
[1:53:32] worthy to take it but there was a line
[1:53:35] that
[1:53:36] prevailed Amen on Easter morning that
[1:53:38] son arose Jesus Christ the tomb rolled
[1:53:43] the stone rolled away and all of
[1:53:47] humanity
[1:53:50] amen especially those who have had their
[1:53:52] names on the book is't that right how
[1:53:56] many believes God's word is
[1:53:58] true if he wrote your name on the book
[1:54:00] you reckon he's going to lose you no
[1:54:03] that's where our consolation is our hope
[1:54:05] is in the fact not that youve begun to
[1:54:07] work well now you better quit that and
[1:54:10] you better yeah you better live right if
[1:54:12] not the Holy Ghost will get you but
[1:54:15] that's not what your salvation's based
[1:54:16] on and your salvation is based on all
[1:54:20] that the father has given me will come
[1:54:23] amen he says and my father you know they
[1:54:26] wear in his hands and no man can pluck
[1:54:28] them out of my father's hand how many
[1:54:31] believes that he had you are in God's
[1:54:33] hands do you ever remember when you was
[1:54:36] kids you'd play and you'd hold something
[1:54:37] in your hand and say try to get it out
[1:54:39] of my hand you know it's something about
[1:54:41] that hand right now you might be able to
[1:54:43] peel that thumb back right that but you
[1:54:46] know to try to get to these guys try to
[1:54:48] get to them fingers especially a strong
[1:54:51] man it's very hard to get that hand open
[1:54:54] can't get that ho open well you sure
[1:54:57] ain't gonna get his hand open nobody's
[1:55:00] going to pluck you out of his hand
[1:55:02] nothing can and I'm resting on that how
[1:55:05] many our hope is in
[1:55:07] Christ and it's a solid
[1:55:10] rock you can never take that hope away
[1:55:13] from
[1:55:14] me that no matter what comes no matter
[1:55:17] what goes I'm in his hands God can come
[1:55:21] and change whatever situation you're in
[1:55:24] if you'll just
[1:55:29] believe worst thing that a person can do
[1:55:32] is think there's no
[1:55:34] hope no
[1:55:37] hope but you know brother Joe somebody
[1:55:40] that believes something has hope in
[1:55:42] something they're just about Unstoppable
[1:55:45] there's just about nothing that a person
[1:55:47] can't do if they believe in
[1:55:49] it what do you think Benjamin Franklin
[1:55:52] or or
[1:55:54] uh Thomas Edison I believe it was a't
[1:55:57] that right he hoped to have somehow
[1:56:00] create something that will make that
[1:56:02] right
[1:56:03] there how many knows that was that was
[1:56:05] Thomas Edison's dream that was his
[1:56:08] vision that was his hope and he tried
[1:56:11] and he tried a thousand different ways
[1:56:14] and he asked him well what about those
[1:56:16] thousand different way he says well now
[1:56:17] I have a thousand ways didn't I know it
[1:56:19] don't work
[1:56:22] but thanks be to God that he didn't give
[1:56:24] up
[1:56:26] hope got it today ain't that right
[1:56:29] aren't you glad that Christ didn't give
[1:56:31] up no he went all the way to Calvary so
[1:56:34] that you could be free this morning so
[1:56:36] you could have joy this morning
[1:56:39] unspeakable and full of
[1:56:41] glory
[1:56:44] amen oh the God just loves to make it
[1:56:47] look real dark to see whether you'll
[1:56:49] still
[1:56:50] believe in Hope
[1:56:54] that you'll still
[1:56:56] believe in
[1:56:58] Hope amen let's look at a couple more
[1:57:01] stories of course I love I love the
[1:57:04] story of Daniel don't you he didn't
[1:57:08] know but he trusted he his Hope was in
[1:57:11] the
[1:57:12] Lord the strength of horses the strength
[1:57:15] of Kings they're not delivered by the
[1:57:17] strength Kings aren't they aren't
[1:57:19] delivered by their strength now God
[1:57:22] showed in Daniel isn't that right that
[1:57:25] his strength is greater than any Kings
[1:57:26] or any
[1:57:31] Commandments we don't know what the
[1:57:33] future holds do we but aren't you glad
[1:57:36] you have a confidence that you know him
[1:57:38] that holds the future and whatever comes
[1:57:42] he's got you whatever comes he's got
[1:57:50] you woo
[1:57:53] oh my I want to go to Romans yet but
[1:57:56] let's go this way first I thought about
[1:57:59] the
[1:58:00] lepers all remember the four lepers
[1:58:03] there were four lepers men at the
[1:58:05] entering in of the gate and they said
[1:58:07] one to another why sit we here until we
[1:58:10] die if we say we will enter into the
[1:58:12] city well the famine is in the city and
[1:58:14] we shall die there if we sit here we
[1:58:17] shall die
[1:58:18] also my my if we go in there we die if
[1:58:22] we stay here we die Ain that right so
[1:58:26] they were looking for a little hope
[1:58:27] weren't they they were looking for some
[1:58:29] glimpse of light at the end of this this
[1:58:32] tunnel
[1:58:33] here amen that's a lot of times how we
[1:58:35] are we need a little light at the end of
[1:58:36] the tunnel that's what the hope is a't
[1:58:38] that right
[1:58:40] amen notice we now therefore come let us
[1:58:44] fall on to the host of the syrians if
[1:58:48] they save us alive we shall live and and
[1:58:52] if they kill us we shall but
[1:58:56] die amen think about it they were at
[1:58:59] that point of death and they only had
[1:59:01] one direction to
[1:59:03] go now we know the enemy man they have
[1:59:05] got it nice man they're eating good
[1:59:08] there's no famine over there a't that
[1:59:10] right and we're going to just have to go
[1:59:12] and throw ourselves at their
[1:59:14] Mercy is't that right and they rose up
[1:59:17] in the Twilight to go into the camp of
[1:59:19] the Assyrians and when they were coming
[1:59:21] to the other most parts of the camp of
[1:59:23] Syria behold there was no man there for
[1:59:26] the Lord had made the host of the
[1:59:28] syrians to hear a noise of Chariots and
[1:59:31] the noise of horses even in the noise of
[1:59:33] a great hosts and they said one to
[1:59:35] another Lord the king of Israel has
[1:59:36] hired against us the Hittites and the
[1:59:38] king of the Egyptians to on us wherefore
[1:59:40] they arose and fled into Twilight left
[1:59:43] their tents and their horses their asses
[1:59:45] to Camp as it was and fled for their
[1:59:47] lives when the lepers came to the utmost

[2:04:15] be the weakest Christians but there's
[2:04:17] still

[2:04:20] hope
[2:04:23] amen praise the
[2:04:27] Lord all right let me go let's talk
[2:04:30] about Samson for a minute brother Braham
[2:04:32] said a lot about this because I had
[2:04:35] called hope possibility is that
[2:04:39] right hope is a possibility in other
[2:04:41] words there's a chance yet there's hope
[2:04:45] and Sam you know he had been a
[2:04:47] Christian he was a mighty warrior of God
[2:04:51] looked at as a God that could not be
[2:04:54] defeated a't that right but he had got
[2:04:57] backslid he had got cold on God hope
[2:05:01] nobody's there like that today
[2:05:03] amen but he had got cold on God he had
[2:05:06] gotten away from what he used to be as a
[2:05:08] Christian good question right there
[2:05:10] folks got away from what he used to be
[2:05:12] as a Christian are you a better
[2:05:14] Christian today or was you a better
[2:05:15] Christian 5 years ago two years ago a
[2:05:18] month ago where are you at this morning
[2:05:20] amen say Samson had got way backslid his
[2:05:24] eyes had got taken out a't that right
[2:05:27] but brother baham said that he opened up
[2:05:29] his mind he said Samson thought that
[2:05:32] there must be a possibility see he
[2:05:34] caught the idea W isn't that right
[2:05:39] anybody anywhere whatever your situation
[2:05:42] is outside of blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[2:05:45] catch the
[2:05:48] idea catch that glimpse of Hope no know
[2:05:51] that you don't have to be like
[2:05:54] that that's the start right there and
[2:05:58] then go from
[2:06:00] there
[2:06:03] amen but the sad part listen he had
[2:06:05] caught the idea but the sad part is
[2:06:07] today the church don't catch that they
[2:06:09] don't realize that there is a
[2:06:11] possibility of a
[2:06:13] Revival they haven't caught the vision
[2:06:15] yet another place he says he knew that
[2:06:18] there was a possibility but the thing of
[2:06:20] it is today the people don't seem to be
[2:06:22] conscious that there is a possibility
[2:06:24] they're satisfied to go right on into
[2:06:26] the trend that they're always going on
[2:06:29] well I've always been like this you
[2:06:30] don't have to always be like this I've
[2:06:33] never overcome this that or the other
[2:06:34] well you can't overcome this that or the
[2:06:36] other there's a possibility that you can
[2:06:38] live higher than what you
[2:06:40] do There's Hope for
[2:06:43] you you've got a perfect mediator
[2:06:46] sitting there waiting for you to call
[2:06:48] upon
[2:06:49] him when he leaves that Throne people
[2:06:52] will beg and scream and everything else
[2:06:54] but there won't be any
[2:06:56] hope my definition of hell is no
[2:07:01] hope that's
[2:07:04] hell you want to live in a Hell live in
[2:07:07] a place where there's no hope that's why
[2:07:09] so many shoot themselves kill themselves
[2:07:11] they
[2:07:12] despair because there's nothing to live
[2:07:15] for young people you're going to think
[2:07:17] you're going to think well what am I
[2:07:18] going to do how I'm going to what am
