[20:14] I was uh with my wife Rebecca and she
[20:17] wants to come for her song I was with
[20:19] Rebecca
[20:21] just recently in a Walmart and we were
[20:24] walking out of the Walmart and we were
[20:25] talking to a young man
[20:27] and he just opened up to us and he said
[20:29] he was dealing with anxiety and
[20:31] depression and we went to a a sales
[20:35] conference about a week ago up in
[20:37] Philadelphia a man Ray's asked the
[20:40] people to raise their hands how many
[20:41] dealt with anxiety and so many different
[20:44] ones raised their hand I began to
[20:47] realize that is the tactic of the devil
[20:48] is to put anxiety and fear and
[20:50] depression on the people and they don't
[20:52] know where to go and where to turn but I
[20:54] believe God's people are free tonight I
[20:56] believe God's people have a right to be
[20:58] free they have a right to not be under
[21:00] anxiety and a spirit of the devil and
[21:02] under depression but God's people can be
[21:04] set free denied if you have something
[21:06] and you're struggling in your mind I
[21:08] just rebuked that Spirit In The Name of
[21:09] Jesus Christ you can be free denied in
[21:11] his presence amen Becky

[40:45] well I really don't want to Tim said
[40:47] forget it I said um I'll get somebody
[40:49] else I said if I'd ask him go golfing he
[40:51] said sure when you want to go
[40:53] I said when it comes to do something for
[40:54] the Lord they get nervous and get scared
[40:56] and I said but you know that's what you
[40:58] you called upon to do something for God
[41:00] it's an honor to be able to do something
[41:01] for the Lord so I called it text another
[41:04] young man to church so how do you like
[41:05] the lead song oh absolutely so I said
[41:07] okay then you lead song service amen
[41:10] first Samuel chapter 12 if you have your
[41:12] Bibles I want to read verses 1 to 5.
[41:16] and then I'd like to read Galatians 6.
[41:18] you know I I said this I had six Sons
[41:21] and one daughter
[41:24] and people ask me all the time ever
[41:26] since I was young they would ask me
[41:28] um any of your boys called to preach I
[41:30] said how am I supposed to know
[41:34] daddy don't call Sons to preach
[41:37] I said I don't know if they're called to
[41:38] preach out between them and God I said
[41:40] if it's up to me I'd never call them to
[41:42] preach said really I said no I said man
[41:45] I know what I've been through I said I
[41:46] don't want them to have to go through
[41:47] the same thing I said if man's caught of
[41:50] God that's up to God to tell him if he's
[41:52] called to preach none of my sons ever
[41:54] showed any uh like sort of an interest
[41:58] into the ministry or feel like the
[41:59] Lord's called him until about four
[42:01] months ago Zechariah came to me and told
[42:04] me he felt like there was a call of God
[42:05] on his life so I said well son that's
[42:07] what you do if you feel that way you
[42:09] pray and you just stay before God and
[42:11] you read your Bible and you just stay
[42:13] right there and I said if it's there God
[42:14] will burn your heart with something and
[42:16] it'll be like fire shut up in your bones
[42:18] amen but if I call him then there's a
[42:21] lot of trouble for him down the road if
[42:22] God calls him and the lord always takes
[42:24] care of those whom he calls amen so we
[42:27] do appreciate God calling young
[42:28] preachers I first started when I was 13
[42:30] years old started preaching first time I
[42:33] ever preached was 13 years old preaching
[42:35] in a church that was about just the size
[42:37] of these pews here preacher asked me to
[42:39] come down and preach and I knew it was
[42:41] called as a young man and and he asked
[42:43] me to come and preach and I said sir I
[42:45] can't even drive I said my brother my
[42:47] oldest brother will drive me so my
[42:49] brother Chuck drove me all the way down
[42:50] about 40 miles from where we lived and I
[42:52] went down to preach on a Sunday night to
[42:54] the youth and I preached my first sermon
[42:56] was about I don't know maybe
[42:59] 10 to 15 minutes is all it was and I
[43:01] preached on faith
[43:03] it was such a powerful message because I
[43:05] preached on how Moses built the ark
[43:09] some some old lady said on the front row
[43:13] and I kept hearing her while I preached
[43:15] going
[43:17] no and I was like what is she talking
[43:20] about not preaching longer how Moses God
[43:22] spoke to him to build that art and he
[43:23] did it by faith every time I'd say Moses
[43:25] she'd go no
[43:28] at the end of my message I finally
[43:30] figured out what she was saying I said
[43:31] have I been preaching Moses she said
[43:33] yeah it's not Moses son it's Noah
[43:38] so you got to start somewhere
[43:41] amen
[43:42] so we appreciate the Lord for God still
[43:45] calling people
[43:47] that means he's not done yet
[43:49] amen if God calls you just to bring one
[43:51] and bring him to maturity
[43:54] you've done a lot for the kingdom of God
[43:55] Amen SEC first Samuel chapter 12
[43:58] beginning with verse 1.
[44:01] and Samuel said unto all of Israel
[44:05] behold I have hearkened unto your voice
[44:08] and all that you said unto me
[44:11] and have made a king
[44:14] over you
[44:16] and now behold the king walketh before
[44:20] you
[44:21] and I am old
[44:24] and gray-headed
[44:27] behold my sons are with you
[44:30] and I have walked before you from my
[44:33] childhood
[44:35] unto this day
[44:37] now that would seem like a a great scene
[44:40] but to be honest with you the old man
[44:42] had come to a place where God had used
[44:44] him to be their Prophet really to be
[44:47] their king and leader and priest and
[44:49] judge and all of those things but they
[44:51] got their eyes on the other nations
[44:53] and they wanted to be like the other
[44:54] nations and they wanted a king
[44:57] God told Samuel one day he said Samuel
[44:59] Samuel was weeping he said look they've
[45:02] not rejected you they have rejected me
[45:04] from ruling over them give the people
[45:06] what they want
[45:07] and God gave them Saul and he said this
[45:11] behold here I am Witness
[45:14] against me before the Lord before his
[45:17] anointed whose ox have I taken
[45:21] whose house have I taken and whom have I
[45:25] defrauded think about this whom have I
[45:27] oppressed or whose hand have I received
[45:30] any bribe to Blind my eyes there with
[45:33] and I will restore it to you in you and
[45:37] they said thou Hast not defrauded us nor
[45:40] oppressed us neither hath thou taken art
[45:43] of any man's hand
[45:45] he said unto them the Lord is witness
[45:48] against you and his anointed is witness
[45:51] this
[45:52] today that ye have not found ought in my
[45:56] hand
[45:57] and they answered he is Witness
[46:01] turned me again to verse two if you
[46:03] would and it says behold the king
[46:06] walketh before you
[46:08] and I am old and gray-headed
[46:10] and hold my sons are with you and I have
[46:13] walked before you from my childhood
[46:17] unto this day terminally Galatians
[46:20] chapter six if you would
[46:21] I'd like to read from verse six
[46:24] and misread through verse 10 and then
[46:26] I'll let you take your seats Galatians
[46:28] chapter 6.
[46:30] beginning with verse 6.
[46:36] the Apostle Paul was writing he said let
[46:38] him that is taught in the word
[46:40] communicate unto him that teaches in all
[46:44] good things
[46:46] be not deceived
[46:48] God is Not mocked
[46:50] but whatsoever man soweth that shall he
[46:53] also reap
[46:55] for he that soweth to his flesh shall of
[46:57] his flesh reap corruption
[47:00] but he that soweth to the spirit shall
[47:01] love the spirit reap life Everlasting
[47:04] what a wonderful promise
[47:07] let us not be weary in well-doing for
[47:09] induces and we shall reap if we faint
[47:12] not
[47:12] and as he have therefore opportunity let
[47:15] us do good unto all men especially unto
[47:18] them who are the household
[47:21] of faith
[47:23] I want to speak tonight if I could for a
[47:25] few minutes and I'm trying to direct my
[47:27] thoughts mainly to our young people but
[47:31] it may feel like it's across the board
[47:34] but this is some of the things that's
[47:36] upon my heart and I'd like to speak as a
[47:39] title if I was going to put a thought in
[47:41] your mind it would be sowing and reaping
[47:43] but really my background thought would
[47:46] be
[47:47] um
[47:48] that you'd live such a life that you
[47:50] wouldn't be haunted from the decisions
[47:52] that you make from childhood
[47:55] let's power his father
[47:59] or the great privilege it is tonight to
[48:01] be in your presence
[48:04] Lord and I thought today every person
[48:06] that would be here tonight it's your
[48:07] ordination
[48:09] his service was predestinated from the
[48:11] foundation of the world
[48:13] and Lord of just one person life has
[48:16] changed
[48:17] it would be worth every effort that we
[48:19] have made
[48:20] Lord we come now to speak upon your holy
[48:24] blessed word
[48:25] means more than life to us father
[48:28] as we broke the bread now we've read
[48:31] from its Pages we're asking you to come
[48:33] and break the bread of life to us may
[48:36] you speak to every heart help every
[48:38] individual Lord you know what we have
[48:40] need of Father you know what's upon my
[48:42] heart May Minister grace to the hearers
[48:44] tonight
[48:45] May lives be changed may we leave this
[48:48] place closer to you than what we were
[48:50] when we come in and we'll give you
[48:52] praise for all things in the name of the
[48:54] Lord Jesus Christ and the whole church
[48:56] says amen God bless you you may be
[48:59] seated sister Claire that young man they
[49:01] mentioned Trevor was that the one that
[49:03] you brought forth last night so they're
[49:05] taking him off the is
[49:07] in a positive good way that's wonderful
[49:10] praise the Lord he's still the same
[49:12] yesterday today and forever isn't he
[49:14] in our text tonight
[49:16] we read of an age prophet
[49:19] a gray-haired old man who stands before
[49:22] Israel the whole nation
[49:25] and he looks at every man every woman
[49:28] every boy and there were some in that
[49:30] crowd that had watched him from a child
[49:33] witness life as he came through as a
[49:36] little boy in the temple watched him
[49:39] come developed into maybe what we would
[49:41] say a teenage
[49:43] seen him come into a married life and a
[49:46] little bit older and come into His more
[49:49] adult years and then watched him come
[49:51] all the way into his old age seen his
[49:54] hair grow come from a little maybe we
[49:56] would say a little black-headed boy a
[49:58] little brown-headed boy and come on up
[50:00] and watched his hair change colors and
[50:03] see him stand there as a gray-headed old
[50:06] man
[50:07] and he looks at the whole audience the
[50:09] nation said you have watched me ever
[50:11] since I was a child
[50:13] and I want anybody that's among you
[50:16] that's ever heard me say anything that
[50:18] was not right according to the word of
[50:21] God I want you to stand up now and if
[50:24] I've defrauded you if I've done anything
[50:26] that I shouldn't have done you tell me
[50:28] and I'll make it right before you now
[50:32] and all the nations spoke back just to
[50:36] think about what they spoke back said
[50:38] Samuel you're right
[50:39] not everybody could say this and watched
[50:42] him as he's older but there was some in
[50:44] that crowd maybe was his age that come
[50:46] up with him some may be a little older
[50:48] that watched him and seen his life from
[50:51] a childhood all the way up said you're
[50:53] right we've watched you as a child we
[50:55] watched you develop we watched you age
[50:57] and we have never seen nor heard
[51:01] anything out of you that was not right
[51:05] when I think of that I think of what a
[51:07] powerful testimony that is that it
[51:10] wasn't after he got old that he decided
[51:12] to do the right things he started out as
[51:15] a child and as a child he developed up
[51:18] into becoming an age man in his entire
[51:21] life was spent to try to please one
[51:23] person and that was the one that called
[51:26] him all Mighty God
[51:29] now think what a testimony that he had
[51:32] to stand there before that crowd really
[51:35] is almost at times a sinful nation and
[51:39] yet he was never caught up in their sin
[51:41] I'm sure he saw a lot of bribery saw a
[51:43] lot of compromise that took place but
[51:46] yet in the midst and I'll prove it to
[51:47] you in a minute but it's the midst of
[51:49] all of it he stayed true to God even as
[51:51] a child all the way up to an old man
[51:53] never compromised on the principles that
[51:56] God placed within his life that's a
[51:59] powerful testimony for somebody to have
[52:02] and I'm sure tonight if you're here that
[52:04] would be your desire too that you would
[52:06] never compromise on the principles and
[52:08] the convictions that God has placed in
[52:11] your life
[52:12] he carried a testimony that he pleased
[52:15] the Lord for a few minutes tonight I'd
[52:17] like to introduce a couple of principles
[52:20] to you young people to think about it's
[52:22] things that I have used as a guide
[52:24] throughout my life and this was one of
[52:27] the pre
[52:28] principles that life is not a chalkboard
[52:33] life is not a chalkboard
[52:35] what that means that you don't simply
[52:38] erase the mistakes and the failures and
[52:42] start all over again
[52:43] [Applause]
[52:44] why why is that because here's the facts
[52:47] you can do some things that while you're
[52:50] young
[52:51] that you certainly can be forgiven of
[52:54] by the grace of God but you'll have to
[52:56] live with those things the rest of your
[52:59] life
[53:01] don't misunderstand me because I'm a
[53:04] firm preacher that God is a forgiving
[53:06] God doesn't matter in fact if he wasn't
[53:08] we might as well walk out these doors
[53:10] get in our cars and go home tonight
[53:12] because none of us got no hope if God
[53:15] wasn't a forgiving God that's a fact he
[53:18] is a forgiving God and that's the reason
[53:19] we're here and we read last night and
[53:21] spoke of how he's a god of mercy and not
[53:24] just the god of Mercy he's a god who's
[53:26] rich in Mercy
[53:28] Hallelujah and though we're sins
[53:31] blessing closely now may be washed away
[53:33] that's a fact but if we do things while
[53:36] we're young God can forgive us of those
[53:39] things but if we're not careful they
[53:42] will bear scars in our life
[53:45] that we will
[53:47] carry to the graveyard
[53:51] not my health when even as a boy I
[53:54] didn't look at my mother and father as
[53:56] legalism as law but I looked at them as
[53:59] God's voice to me when I couldn't hear
[54:03] God I knew that them parents was placed
[54:06] over me as God's instruction to me I
[54:09] used to get up so upset at my mother and
[54:12] I didn't understand I had an older
[54:13] brother that really made me mad because
[54:15] it come time for the school and the
[54:17] school would have these dances and my
[54:19] brother and I would like to go and
[54:21] really what met we would dance because
[54:23] we was too embarrassed to do that but we
[54:25] want to just kind of be around our
[54:26] friends and I had a little Praying
[54:28] Mother that she wouldn't she'd always
[54:30] tell us no you're not going to those
[54:33] things at that time they started out
[54:35] all this bright dancing stuff you know
[54:37] looking like their bodies are breaking
[54:39] down spinning around and I had a mother
[54:41] that refused to let us go and I used to
[54:44] say I wish so and so was my mama I'd say
[54:46] something like that and some of the boy
[54:49] I spoke about last night that's been in
[54:51] prison all these years I was talking
[54:52] about his mama look where he's at today
[54:56] look at the mother I had look where I'm
[54:58] at tonight you say it's not because of
[55:00] that yes it is I had got the influence
[55:03] upon my life and when I couldn't
[55:05] recognize God and I couldn't hear him
[55:07] for myself my mother and father was
[55:10] God's voice to me now Look Back Now on
[55:13] the things that they told me know about
[55:15] refused to let me do when they wouldn't
[55:18] let me miss church when other kids would
[55:20] they wouldn't let me stay at other kids
[55:22] house and they'd run off and do this and
[55:24] do that list the house of God I had to
[55:26] come when I didn't want to they brought
[55:28] me anyways but I look back today and I
[55:31] speak the decisions that my mother and
[55:33] father made even when I didn't
[55:35] understand it today at 52 years there's
[55:38] a lot of scars that's not on this old
[55:40] boy's life because somewhere God put
[55:43] some Godly instruction in my life they
[55:45] wasn't trying to just keep me from doing
[55:47] what everybody else was doing they was
[55:49] trying to keep me from living with a lot
[55:51] of scars that I'd have to deal with the
[55:53] rest of my life
[55:57] now I'm going to be bad playing for just
[55:59] a minute
[56:00] and I'm going to try to be as quick as
[56:02] possible
[56:03] let's talk to the young sisters just a
[56:06] minute I speak of this at my home Church
[56:09] matter of fact I got a whole generation
[56:11] of young people that I have preached to
[56:13] in personal ways for many years ago that
[56:16] I hadn't spoke to these young men here
[56:18] in these young ladies they hear me
[56:20] preach but years ago I dealt with young
[56:22] people a lot and dealt with them and
[56:23] dealt with them and and today there's a
[56:26] crop there that made right choices and
[56:28] today they're enjoying the benefits and
[56:30] the reaping from the righteous seeds
[56:33] that they sowed and decisions that they
[56:34] make and I'm telling you there's
[56:36] decisions that you're going to make
[56:37] tonight decision you'll make tomorrow
[56:39] decision you'll make this coming week
[56:42] that you will reap the benefits of those
[56:45] decisions for years to come
[56:48] now brother Branham spoke of young lady
[56:51] this is what he said to you young lady
[56:53] you have something that is a sacred
[56:57] Trust
[56:58] that has been given to you
[57:00] that sacred trust brother bam said are
[57:03] certain characters that she must not
[57:05] defile
[57:07] a woman is a sacred trust to that then
[57:11] he said she's also been given a sacred
[57:13] charge from God for Redemption she's got
[57:17] characters that she must not do
[57:21] oh the Apostle Paul shoulder picked this
[57:24] up in Timothy they're the second chapter
[57:26] verse 12 and talked about how he
[57:28] suffered not a woman to teach her you're
[57:30] some authority over a man I remember
[57:32] years ago I told some of them women
[57:33] preachers they found out my daddy didn't
[57:35] believe me when preachers but I preached
[57:37] for a few women preachers y'all forgive
[57:38] me for that but I did and then they
[57:41] found out that my daddy didn't believe
[57:42] in winning preachers and my daddy said
[57:44] now if they ever know that I don't
[57:46] believe in them preachers they're
[57:47] probably going to shut you down but you
[57:49] just give them first Timothy 2 12.
[57:53] he said I promise you if you give them
[57:55] first Timothy 2 12 212 is boiling
[57:59] temperature and if you give them 212
[58:01] they are going to boil on you
[58:04] and they did
[58:06] and they did I've had some shut my
[58:09] meeting down but as I read on there Paul
[58:12] said but she shall be saved in
[58:14] childbearing the reason he says that is
[58:17] because that's how the fall happened and
[58:19] the woman received a mark against her
[58:21] because she brought a child in the world
[58:23] the wrong way but he's saying when you
[58:26] in faith and you got sobriety in those
[58:28] things and you bring children correctly
[58:30] in the right way then you save that
[58:33] character that marked against you you
[58:34] remove that by doing the right thing
[58:38] you can bear marks against your light by
[58:41] making the wrong choices and you can
[58:43] also put marks on your life by making
[58:45] the right choices it's simply sowing and
[58:48] reaping sowing and reaping now brother
[58:50] Ben says this she must not defile that
[58:54] but listen closely
[58:56] if she admire them she is defiled for a
[58:59] life
[59:00] time
[59:01] and what that simply means if you give
[59:03] up your virginity prematurely you can
[59:06] never take that virginity back
[59:10] God did that to you
[59:12] I'm gonna be praying just for a second
[59:14] brother Ben said she could be forgiven
[59:16] but she can't be justified that don't
[59:20] mean that you're not righteous in the
[59:21] sight of God it just simply means that
[59:23] Mark is against you and you could never
[59:25] go back and get your and I'm gonna show
[59:26] you the repercussions of that just for a
[59:28] minute but remember so they got
[59:29] scripture on that in a few minutes she
[59:31] can be forgiven for her defilement but
[59:33] cannot be justified in this life it's
[59:36] always with her so you got that little
[59:39] Mark against you notice she's been given
[59:41] this she may be forgiven but not
[59:44] justified now let me tell you what that
[59:46] means young lady what that's tell
[59:49] that doesn't mean that you can't never
[59:51] be with a man but you gotta be with a
[59:53] man in the right time
[59:55] and prematurely before marriage is the
[59:58] wrong time
[1:00:01] it's called in the Bible and I should
[1:00:03] have got a big Amen on that that's
[1:00:05] called fornication
[1:00:07] is that right and if you give that up
[1:00:11] what I'm saying doesn't mean you can't
[1:00:13] be forgiven but if you let some young
[1:00:15] man defile You by convincing you that if
[1:00:19] you love him you'll go to bed with him
[1:00:22] prior to marriage oh yes if you I love
[1:00:27] you then you realize the property God
[1:00:29] said if that young man goes off and he's
[1:00:32] not man enough to marry you now that
[1:00:34] Mark is against you you so I can hide it
[1:00:37] from then I'll know you can't the
[1:00:39] properly God said so against you that if
[1:00:41] you were to meet another boy and you
[1:00:42] were to marry him you would
[1:00:44] have to confess that thing prior to the
[1:00:48] marriage
[1:00:51] now you say well that's easy no it's not
[1:00:54] upset with several that I've had to
[1:00:56] stand between both of them and allow her
[1:00:59] to confess this thing and it's not an
[1:01:01] easy thing it's like a knife in his
[1:01:04] heart and it's a knife in hers because
[1:01:05] she has to keep bringing it up she has
[1:01:08] to say it to him she has to now and I
[1:01:10] won't get into all the details but I'm
[1:01:12] simply saying this that you have to
[1:01:14] confess that thing because it's a Mark
[1:01:16] that gives you if you fail to confess it
[1:01:18] and you hide that thing and he marries
[1:01:21] you the prophet said for the saving for
[1:01:23] the cause of foreign attention he finds
[1:01:25] out later think of the hurt think of the
[1:01:28] trouble that comes to your life if he
[1:01:30] finds out the puppet said he would have
[1:01:31] a right to put your way in divorcement
[1:01:33] and remarry another
[1:01:35] look at the hurt look at the trouble
[1:01:38] that such a decision brings to your life
[1:01:41] now let me just say something to you
[1:01:43] young boys just for a second you should
[1:01:45] respect that young lady in such a way
[1:01:48] that you would never ever lead her down
[1:01:50] that path if you say you love her then
[1:01:53] respect her if you take her to bed prior
[1:01:56] to marriage you don't love her you left
[1:01:59] her is what you do and you you've
[1:02:01] confused and the difference between real
[1:02:03] agape love and lust of the flesh
[1:02:09] am I right
[1:02:13] you date that young lady
[1:02:16] as I've told my sons you date that young
[1:02:19] lady as you would want a young man to
[1:02:22] date your sister
[1:02:25] I got a daughter over here and she's not
[1:02:29] dating yet when she gets 30 her and I
[1:02:32] and him are going to have a wonderful
[1:02:33] time on our first date
[1:02:37] and I've got a little pistol
[1:02:41] that she's going to have as her own
[1:02:43] dedicated from her father
[1:02:45] and I tell him if he climbs over Matthew
[1:02:48] Mark Luke or John to get to you you put
[1:02:50] that pest on his rep
[1:02:54] and say I will not judge you but I will
[1:02:56] set your appointment
[1:03:01] now listen
[1:03:03] that's just a little joke there to
[1:03:05] lighten you up because some of you is
[1:03:06] already turning your faces a certain way
[1:03:08] because of my subject but I know people
[1:03:11] don't take this seriously enough
[1:03:13] the reason I take it serious is because
[1:03:16] I know that there's repercussions that
[1:03:19] that thing leaves behind for years
[1:03:22] everybody else is going on with their
[1:03:24] life
[1:03:25] that young girl has to constantly deal
[1:03:27] with that and when the young man as I
[1:03:29] said a couple down not too many months
[1:03:32] ago and and she confessed and he said I
[1:03:34] forgive her I said listen my brother I
[1:03:37] want you to understand something if you
[1:03:39] can forgive her don't you ever ever
[1:03:42] bring this thing back up again nowhere
[1:03:46] in your marriage if she represents the
[1:03:49] bride you represent Christ and if you
[1:03:51] say you forgive her you wipe that out
[1:03:53] now listen as a man he can't wipe that
[1:03:56] out of his mind but he can have enough
[1:03:57] hope
[1:03:58] oh
[1:04:00] Holy Ghost about him to never bring that
[1:04:02] up don't stick in your back pocket and
[1:04:05] when you get upset somewhere down the
[1:04:06] road you bring that thing up on her I'll
[1:04:08] tell you what's going to happen it won't
[1:04:10] be hurts and no more it'll be your sin
[1:04:12] [Applause]
[1:04:14] but you see the great repercussions that
[1:04:17] comes from that let me give you an
[1:04:19] example there's a man in the Bible that
[1:04:21] we all love and the Bible speaks so well
[1:04:23] about him
[1:04:25] and his name is David and the Bible said
[1:04:27] is a man after God's Own Heart but did
[1:04:30] you know there's a mark against David
[1:04:32] that when you read the scriptures
[1:04:34] everybody knows it there was such a
[1:04:36] failure in neighbor's life one day
[1:04:38] when there was a woman on top of the
[1:04:40] house taking a bath
[1:04:42] and her name was Bathsheba and David saw
[1:04:45] her she was such a beautiful woman I
[1:04:48] don't understand it I can't understand
[1:04:49] it probably never will understand how a
[1:04:52] man could have 500 wives and one another
[1:04:54] one
[1:04:56] I can't comprehend that that means I
[1:05:00] could see Lisa today and not see her
[1:05:03] again until a year and a half
[1:05:06] that's mind-boggling but you understand
[1:05:09] David had 500 wives
[1:05:12] that don't mean that he loved them all
[1:05:14] the way he should have loved them
[1:05:16] but he saw this woman and he plotted a
[1:05:19] certain thing and you know the story I
[1:05:21] won't have time to go into it you know
[1:05:23] the story how it went not only turned
[1:05:25] adultery he turned to murder
[1:05:28] he plotted a murder of her own husband
[1:05:30] because he knew the law you don't touch
[1:05:32] another man's wife
[1:05:34] he could have had a thousand
[1:05:36] and wide and all them women could not
[1:05:39] have but one husband but David could
[1:05:42] never even though he could take as many
[1:05:43] wives as he wanted he could never take
[1:05:45] touch a woman it's already been given to
[1:05:48] another man
[1:05:50] so what he thought was I'll kill your
[1:05:52] husband I'll free her and then I can
[1:05:55] take her now he might have puddled out
[1:05:57] all out but in the eyes of God it was
[1:05:58] something altogether different
[1:06:00] because what God did you know the story
[1:06:02] he got her pregnant and that's why he
[1:06:05] partner knew what he did he committed
[1:06:07] adultery
[1:06:10] and he plotted her husband's death and
[1:06:12] he died and I think of that man when
[1:06:15] David called him in you know the big
[1:06:16] plot I'll call him in I'll get him and
[1:06:18] go see his wife when David goes to bed
[1:06:20] that night he's thinking oh it's all
[1:06:22] settled now he'll go home and have
[1:06:24] relationship I'll bring the baby on him
[1:06:26] when he wakes up and open his doors he
[1:06:28] looks down and there lays the man
[1:06:32] wouldn't even go home and have pleasure
[1:06:35] with his wife while his brother right
[1:06:37] there on the bed
[1:06:39] finally David realized I can't get this
[1:06:41] man to go you talk about a soldier's
[1:06:43] heart you talk about a faithful spirit
[1:06:46] finally David said there's only one
[1:06:48] thing I can do I'll have to send him
[1:06:50] with his own death warrant and I don't
[1:06:51] know about y'all but if a king called me
[1:06:53] in and and wanted me to go see my wife
[1:06:56] or my little mind start working
[1:06:58] and David ruled out a really what he did
[1:07:01] he wrote out a death warrant handed it
[1:07:03] to him you're right wasn't it
[1:07:07] he goes back to the battlefield I don't
[1:07:09] know about y'all but my quizlet of mine
[1:07:11] would have went to work and I would have
[1:07:13] wanted to open that and read it let's
[1:07:14] say the man didn't open it then he was
[1:07:16] carrying his own death warrant and
[1:07:18] ignorance not knowing that he's going to
[1:07:19] die when he gets back to the to the
[1:07:21] captain but what if it did open how much
[1:07:24] more of a man was he
[1:07:26] that knowing that he's walking to his
[1:07:28] death but for his King oh God Lord give
[1:07:32] us a spirit like that if I have to go to
[1:07:34] death I'll do it for my king
[1:07:37] he goes down there and he dies
[1:07:40] and David's thinking it's all settled
[1:07:43] one day
[1:07:45] there came a knock on the door
[1:07:48] David opened that stood God's prophet
[1:07:51] and they begin to tell David a parable
[1:07:53] and when he told David a parable he said
[1:07:55] what should we do and David said the man
[1:07:57] should die and all these words that just
[1:08:00] so like they rushed out of Eternity
[1:08:02] these words said you are the man
[1:08:07] and can you imagine from that came these
[1:08:10] words
[1:08:11] David was forgiven God forgave him for
[1:08:15] his sin he did he spoke in Psalms 51
[1:08:18] when he wrote Psalm 51 you have time to
[1:08:21] read it he writes that because of the
[1:08:22] sin with Bathsheba
[1:08:24] he said created me a clean heart o God
[1:08:26] restored to me the joy of my salvation
[1:08:28] but then he said this against thee and
[1:08:32] the only have I sinned he acknowledges
[1:08:35] sin before God he was forgiven that
[1:08:38] didn't mean to go God it's an okay David
[1:08:40] you're forgiven we'll wipe it out no
[1:08:42] longer have to deal with it no God said
[1:08:44] you're forgiven but these are the words
[1:08:46] that came from God the sword shall never
[1:08:49] depart
[1:08:50] from my house
[1:08:52] because thou Hast despised me and have
[1:08:54] taken your eye the hittite the white
[1:08:57] from your eye the hiptide to be thy wife
[1:09:00] and later on God told him you caused my
[1:09:02] enemies to bless me Lord Brother we
[1:09:05] think about that things we do we don't
[1:09:07] realize the outside world that's
[1:09:09] watching our actions the things we do
[1:09:11] and we think they just speak against us
[1:09:13] no it brings a reproach against the very
[1:09:15] Christ and the Very gospel the very
[1:09:17] message we claim to represent
[1:09:20] try
[1:09:21] and God told David the sword shall never
[1:09:24] depart find later on that sword started
[1:09:27] waking awake making its way through
[1:09:29] David's family David live with a lot of
[1:09:32] heartache over one naked woman one
[1:09:35] decision that he made
[1:09:37] that sword cut that sword severed caused
[1:09:41] one of his sons to take one of his wives
[1:09:43] out on the house not before all Israel
[1:09:45] committed to that with his own father's
[1:09:47] life and another son that raped the
[1:09:49] sister the sword was just cutting
[1:09:52] through that family and I'm going to
[1:09:54] tell you something long after David was
[1:09:55] forgiven long after David lived David
[1:09:59] had to deal with scars from one decision
[1:10:02] that he made I want this to soak in
[1:10:05] tonight I wanted to soak in good God's
[1:10:07] not trying to keep you from pleasure God
[1:10:10] look the bed is undefiled landing is a
[1:10:12] white coming together in sexual
[1:10:14] relationship is a wonderful thing in the
[1:10:16] eyes of God he's not trying to torment
[1:10:18] you he's not trying to keep you from
[1:10:20] that he's just telling you wait till
[1:10:22] you're married why because the marriage
[1:10:24] is Honorable among all and the bet is
[1:10:27] undefiled but prior to that it's going
[1:10:30] to put a scar in your life that you'll
[1:10:32] take from now all the way to your grave
[1:10:37] it's a sword it leaves scars behind
[1:10:41] it's a womb that has to be dealt with
[1:10:43] don't be deceived by thinking in your
[1:10:46] younger years you can sow all of your
[1:10:50] Wild Oats so to speak then because
[1:10:52] you're
[1:10:53] staying it erases the scars no it erases
[1:10:57] the sins
[1:10:58] but the scars will remain
[1:11:05] what I'm saying sip is this
[1:11:08] I want you to know
[1:11:10] that it pays to live for God and make
[1:11:13] right decisions while you're young
[1:11:19] having a good time
[1:11:20] we're trying to keep you from wounding
[1:11:23] yourself
[1:11:25] maybe because of immaturity
[1:11:27] maybe because some young man works on
[1:11:30] your emotions listen young man I know
[1:11:32] I'm no dummy I was your age at one time
[1:11:34] that's the reason that pornography is so
[1:11:36] powerful on young men because young men
[1:11:38] are moved by what they see
[1:11:40] and a young lady is moved by what she
[1:11:43] hears that's why young lady you can
[1:11:45] you've got to be careful of a slick
[1:11:47] talker you got to watch them double
[1:11:49] tongue boys
[1:11:52] I'm not talking about these church kids
[1:11:53] I'm talking about some of these guys
[1:11:55] maybe out there in the world that will
[1:11:57] talk to you behind your father's back
[1:11:59] you use your father as a shield against
[1:12:02] that
[1:12:04] that's why God put him in your life as
[1:12:06] your head to protect you
[1:12:10] young men be careful like David buried
[1:12:12] David said I'll set no evil thing before
[1:12:14] mine eyes
[1:12:16] our parents have to be conscious and be
[1:12:19] aware of you know it's sad brother
[1:12:22] um our pastor here it said when we think
[1:12:25] about it that when men were in these
[1:12:28] things years ago it was hit today it's
[1:12:30] at the fingertips of your children
[1:12:32] right on their phones they can mines can
[1:12:35] be defiled imprints can be placed upon
[1:12:37] their mind that they wrestle with their
[1:12:39] whole life
[1:12:41] that's what's important to guard your
[1:12:43] heart to guard your mind guard your
[1:12:46] spirit y'all with me say Amen
[1:12:49] I'm aware of the fact that you can live
[1:12:51] it up
[1:12:53] but I'm also aware of the fact you may
[1:12:54] never live it down
[1:12:57] brother Madam said some of you young men
[1:12:59] sitting here right now the decisions
[1:13:01] that you make will affect the sea that's
[1:13:03] in your Lawrence in years to come
[1:13:06] I honestly God believe in all my heart
[1:13:09] my soul and body that my children today
[1:13:11] are enjoying the benefits of decisions I
[1:13:14] made when I was a young man
[1:13:17] you young men are going to make
[1:13:19] decisions by the Holy Ghost and the word
[1:13:21] of God that's going to pronounce
[1:13:22] blessings upon your children if God
[1:13:24] should carry in years to come because
[1:13:27] you're going to sow the right thing and
[1:13:29] if you sell the right thing you're going
[1:13:31] to reap the right thing God ain't mocked
[1:13:34] if you sow to the spirit you will up the
[1:13:36] spirit reap everlasting life but if you
[1:13:39] sow the flesh you shall of the flesh
[1:13:41] reap corruption
[1:13:44] I'm not trying to be hard
[1:13:46] I'm trying to be honest with you we
[1:13:48] cannot sow to the Flesh and then when we
[1:13:51] see the crop coming up and the Harvest
[1:13:54] of what we sowed all of a sudden we
[1:13:56] start praying for crop failure
[1:14:01] may not be popular may not be popular
[1:14:04] but I promise you if you live by just
[1:14:07] what I told you you're going to find out
[1:14:09] the most happy years of your life
[1:14:12] God gave you the best years while you're
[1:14:15] young and you'll reap the benefits of
[1:14:17] While You're Young making decisions that
[1:14:20] please almighty God
[1:14:23] I told you last night I gave my heart to
[1:14:25] the Lord at 13 years old and I did
[1:14:30] and I said also I'd never regretted that
[1:14:33] momentous decision that I made
[1:14:36] and I have reaped the benefits
[1:14:38] of what I call Amazing Grace
[1:14:42] but there were so-called friends of mine
[1:14:47] was wrong with me
[1:14:49] they thought I had lost my mind thought
[1:14:52] I'd just become sort of some religious
[1:14:54] kid I was accused of becoming a Catholic
[1:14:57] priest
[1:14:59] and that was because I've showed no
[1:15:02] interest
[1:15:03] in the worldly girls anymore
[1:15:06] I just kind of lost my appetite for that
[1:15:10] and I just dedicated myself to God take
[1:15:13] my Bible the young age 14 15 I'd go down
[1:15:16] to the river up under the bridge and all
[1:15:19] I didn't have tapes and books all I had
[1:15:21] was my Bible and I'd read this Bible
[1:15:24] and I just put the word because David
[1:15:26] said it didn't really acknowledge it all
[1:15:28] then but he said Thy word have I hid in
[1:15:31] my heart that I might not sin against
[1:15:33] thee that's why last night when I said
[1:15:34] pray and read your Bible every day that
[1:15:37] might seem to get monotonous to you but
[1:15:39] you don't realize the Eternal effects
[1:15:41] that it has in your life
[1:15:44] some didn't think it was necessary but I
[1:15:46] should be so dedicated at such a young
[1:15:49] age some thought that I was a fanatic
[1:15:51] and they called me a fanatic for Jesus
[1:15:54] maybe I was in some ways and I was
[1:15:57] certainly a fool for Christ
[1:16:00] I got me a jean jacket on the back of
[1:16:02] that jean jacket it's 16 17 years old I
[1:16:05] painted a big fire and I had three
[1:16:07] crosses and was called Holy Ghost Fire
[1:16:09] now take my my microphone my little
[1:16:12] speaker and that's at a young age stand
[1:16:14] on the street corner and sing and preach
[1:16:16] the gospel
[1:16:17] I was thrown physically out of a
[1:16:19] Catholic church when I confronted for a
[1:16:21] priest and they they told me that I was
[1:16:24] a Protestant back then brother I didn't
[1:16:26] know what a promised it was they said
[1:16:28] you're a Protestant I said oh no I'm not
[1:16:30] I'm a Christian and I didn't realize I
[1:16:33] Protestant was somebody that protested
[1:16:35] church I said I wish I knew then what I
[1:16:38] know now
[1:16:39] they wanted me to go into a confession
[1:16:42] booth in that Catholic church and
[1:16:43] invited me to come and I said what
[1:16:44] what's what I do in there I said you go
[1:16:46] in there and preach me on the other side
[1:16:48] and you can confess your wrongs to him
[1:16:50] your sins I said well that's wonderful
[1:16:52] that's the Bible but it does say confess
[1:16:55] your fault to one to another I said so
[1:16:57] I'll confess mine to you if you'll
[1:16:58] confess yours to me
[1:17:02] I said well it don't work that way I
[1:17:04] said I know because if I go to
[1:17:05] confession mine it ain't gonna take but
[1:17:07] a second because all mine's been covered
[1:17:09] in the blood but if you guys go to
[1:17:10] confession we're going to be here all
[1:17:12] night
[1:17:14] they grab me by my shoulder and took me
[1:17:17] out to the Catholic church and pushed me
[1:17:19] out they just had finished mass and
[1:17:21] there was several hundred cars in the
[1:17:22] parking lot I ran across the street
[1:17:24] because I had my mom and daddy lived
[1:17:26] there and I got my guitar and my speaker
[1:17:27] and microphone and brother I cleared
[1:17:30] that part lock out singing there's power
[1:17:32] in the blood I started singing this a
[1:17:35] song We Sing I sang that song on that
[1:17:37] street corner son in that parking lot
[1:17:39] cleared so fast I emptied it out but
[1:17:41] seeing there's power in the blood
[1:17:44] we preached down on the streets a friend
[1:17:46] of mine got arrested and took him to
[1:17:49] jail and the next morning at nine
[1:17:50] o'clock stood before the judge and the
[1:17:53] judge says so you know why you're here
[1:17:54] he said yes they arrested me for
[1:17:57] preaching the gospel he said no because
[1:17:59] you were disturbing the peace what do
[1:18:01] you have to say for yourself brother the
[1:18:03] Holy Ghost sweeped in and my little
[1:18:05] preacher friend said to that judge said
[1:18:07] judge my Bible said there is no peace to
[1:18:10] the wicked saith God so how can I
[1:18:12] disturb something they ain't got
[1:18:15] the judge hit the podium and said case
[1:18:18] dismissed amen God has a way of doing it
[1:18:21] praise the Lord
[1:18:25] but you know that crowd that thought I
[1:18:27] was a fanatic thought I lost my mind
[1:18:29] thought I didn't need to be that
[1:18:31] dedicated son laughed they're not
[1:18:33] laughing tonight
[1:18:36] I said they're not laughing tonight no
[1:18:39] why because some of them are in prison
[1:18:42] some of their homes have been busted up
[1:18:46] many of our friends are divorced and
[1:18:48] remarried several times
[1:18:51] some of them are raising illegitimate
[1:18:53] children living off welfare
[1:18:56] son of committed suicide I've had to
[1:18:59] walk up in the yard but One landed with
[1:19:01] a gunshot wound a friend of mine
[1:19:03] overdosed and then took a gun tried to
[1:19:05] kill himself he didn't succeed but later
[1:19:08] he did succeed I preached his funeral
[1:19:12] people that thought I was crazy some of
[1:19:14] them tonight or strung out on drugs meth
[1:19:17] cocaine laying in the yards out of their
[1:19:20] mind homeless living in the woods I'm
[1:19:22] talking about people
[1:19:24] and tonight not because I'm any
[1:19:26] different not because I'm better
[1:19:28] but I've never had to put a drug in my
[1:19:30] body I've only had one pill that's ever
[1:19:32] satisfied me and that's called The
[1:19:34] Gospel
[1:19:36] every time I take it I get on a high
[1:19:39] it takes me in the Realms that they
[1:19:41] never know nothing about but when I lay
[1:19:43] my head down tonight I got a piece in my
[1:19:45] mind I don't have scars on my body I
[1:19:49] don't have a scar in my spirit and I
[1:19:51] wake up I lay down with a piece of God
[1:19:52] knowing that if I
[1:19:54] leave this world I'd step out of here
[1:19:56] into another box
[1:19:58] [Applause]
[1:20:00] you understand what I'm talking about
[1:20:01] I'm talking about a man that when you
[1:20:04] make right decision you don't have to
[1:20:05] worry about the repercussions you don't
[1:20:08] have to worry about sorrow down the road
[1:20:09] when you make righteous decisions you
[1:20:11] wake up with a peace of God the holy
[1:20:14] ghost in your heart and you've got so
[1:20:15] almost said you got something money you
[1:20:18] can't never mind
[1:20:21] they want to judge you whether you got a
[1:20:23] fancy house or a fancy car or a boat or
[1:20:27] a camper or this or that brother you
[1:20:29] don't judge Men by that you judge them
[1:20:31] by their character
[1:20:33] I'd rather ride a bicycle like brother
[1:20:36] Madam said eat crackers and
[1:20:39] Branch water no my soul is right with
[1:20:42] God you know sometimes the stuff we call
[1:20:44] blessings ain't blessings from God it's
[1:20:46] blessed day it's blessings if I could
[1:20:49] say it that way it truly curses that
[1:20:51] come from the Devil
[1:20:52] anything you've got in your life that
[1:20:55] takes the place of God don't blame God
[1:20:56] for that
[1:20:58] that's right when God puts a blessing in
[1:21:01] your life it addeth no sorrow with it
[1:21:07] well you got quiet with me there
[1:21:09] but it's right
[1:21:10] you ain't measured by how much you own
[1:21:14] by the fact you measured by who owns you
[1:21:20] tonight is not a laughing matter anymore
[1:21:22] it's a sad matter
[1:21:25] what you do now you'll reap for it down
[1:21:28] the road let me say one more time before
[1:21:30] I get into my little thought here God's
[1:21:32] grace can bring anybody out of anything
[1:21:33] deliver them from whatever
[1:21:37] but the same grace of God
[1:21:39] that can bring you listen to me young
[1:21:40] people the same grace of God that can
[1:21:42] bring people out of that is the same
[1:21:44] grace of God that can keep you from it
[1:21:48] remember years ago in a Pentecostal
[1:21:49] Church there were kids there that never
[1:21:51] drank Never Smoke never cuss never
[1:21:54] commit a fornication never went to the
[1:21:56] movie theaters
[1:21:57] we didn't do those things
[1:21:59] we love having church we never complain
[1:22:01] when we had a seven day Revival we had
[1:22:04] no problem going to church two and three
[1:22:05] weeks in a row I can remember it Mama
[1:22:07] taking me to church daddy take me under
[1:22:08] 10. night after night people still got
[1:22:11] up and went to work now if you have a
[1:22:14] three-day meeting then you're dragging
[1:22:16] on Monday
[1:22:17] we're weak
[1:22:19] but I can remember those days but it
[1:22:22] also bothered me that the only people
[1:22:24] that ever got testified was some drug
[1:22:26] addict nothing against nothing is
[1:22:28] wonderful
[1:22:29] some somebody that God delivered from
[1:22:31] drugs some alcoholic some prostitute
[1:22:34] they'd bring them up there and talk
[1:22:35] about how marvelous God was and here's
[1:22:38] that young people love God never did
[1:22:40] those things and I thought to myself one
[1:22:42] day wait a second the same grace of God
[1:22:45] that brought them from those things that
[1:22:47] same powerful grace of God is what keeps
[1:22:49] some of these young people out of those
[1:22:51] things
[1:22:52] [Applause]
[1:22:53] some of them are living with scars and I
[1:22:55] know them I dealt with them they
[1:22:57] wrestled with that see young person
[1:22:58] every time you allow something in your
[1:23:00] life according to the Lord God that
[1:23:01] brings a mark on you that's a punch that
[1:23:04] Satan's gone at you
[1:23:06] that's something he'll use against you
[1:23:08] down the road but if you stand it with a
[1:23:10] word of God and face him and put the
[1:23:12] word between you and the enemy and so
[1:23:14] right decision and so right things and
[1:23:17] guess what your your God is helping you
[1:23:19] to relieve scars from your heart and
[1:23:20] remember this I'll just say any old dead
[1:23:23] fish can go down the stream but it takes
[1:23:25] a live fish to go against the current
[1:23:28] body can go the way of the world but it
[1:23:30] takes a son and daughter of God that's
[1:23:32] got a backbone and go against the
[1:23:33] society God gets these Philistines way
[1:23:36] and stand for what is right
[1:23:40] I like the little girl
[1:23:43] I just go back to this for a second
[1:23:45] the little girl that kept her virginity
[1:23:48] she'd go to school and I know how it is
[1:23:50] I've been there
[1:23:51] and these kids any of y'all go to public
[1:23:54] schools I don't know most of ours my
[1:23:56] wife homeschooled all of ours they did
[1:23:58] associate with the public school because
[1:24:00] they played the sports for the public
[1:24:01] school and they interacted and those
[1:24:02] type of things we didn't we didn't
[1:24:04] believe in so much separation
[1:24:05] sanctification that our kids would know
[1:24:07] how to operate the world
[1:24:09] I never was afraid brother Thomas to be
[1:24:11] around Sinners that's if they're going
[1:24:13] to defile me I believe I had enough God
[1:24:15] to the center couldn't defile me I've
[1:24:16] never had enough God that I could
[1:24:18] influence the sinner
[1:24:21] and I can tell you a story about it set
[1:24:24] with a man in a restaurant while he's
[1:24:26] drinking Budweiser and while I'm
[1:24:28] drinking a Coke or water time after time
[1:24:30] trying to win that man and just show him
[1:24:33] something about Christ
[1:24:37] and I coached his son in ball and one
[1:24:40] day he came to me and he was so
[1:24:43] impressed how his son had changed it
[1:24:45] didn't become a Christian I just taught
[1:24:47] him how to be respectful and yes sir and
[1:24:49] no sir and took baseball and taught him
[1:24:51] principles about life and respect and
[1:24:53] authority and all that and finally one
[1:24:55] day he he literally asked me I'll just
[1:24:58] tell you the story for a second if I got
[1:25:00] just a few minutes
[1:25:01] and we were sitting the World Series and
[1:25:03] he came to me and said hey somebody told
[1:25:05] me you're a preacher and I said yes sir
[1:25:07] and I've coached the son all year never
[1:25:08] knew I was a preacher because I didn't
[1:25:09] go out there I'm a preacher I'm a
[1:25:10] preacher I was just a Christian that was
[1:25:12] trying to influence these boys into
[1:25:14] something that was good he took I'm
[1:25:16] gonna tell you something my son is not
[1:25:18] the same son because he played for your
[1:25:20] team he's learned what respect is he
[1:25:22] said where do you Pastor not
[1:25:24] I told him where I passed at that time
[1:25:25] he said that little place he said I've
[1:25:27] come by there and it's packed out he
[1:25:28] said you know that's against fire
[1:25:30] marshal for you to have so many people
[1:25:31] in the in that church said if what if a
[1:25:33] fire broke out and my mind was thinking
[1:25:35] we hope it does
[1:25:37] I've been praying for a fire to break
[1:25:39] out and we ain't called a 9-1-1 when it
[1:25:42] does

[1:25:52] of these young people it'll turn this
[1:25:53] community around let a fire break out on
[1:25:56] their hearts I tell you you won't have
[1:25:58] to call a prayer meeting they'll come
[1:25:59] and lock the doors themselves to have a
[1:26:01] prayer meeting
[1:26:02] [Applause]

[1:26:05] heart nobody gonna have to convince him
[1:26:07] and make him want to preach I'll be a

[1:26:23] one or two fires you're either going to
[1:26:24] have the fire of the Holy Ghost that
[1:26:26] John the Baptist said when he comes
[1:26:27] he'll baptize or you're going to have
[1:26:28] that other fire

[1:26:44] well you ever thought about building a
[1:26:46] church I said well yeah he said what
[1:26:48] what organization you're with I said we
[1:26:50] ain't got none
[1:26:52] he said what I said we don't have an
[1:26:54] organization he said I tell you what you
[1:26:56] come to my bank and he was a banker
[1:26:58] ain't said come down to my bank when we
[1:27:00] get back
[1:27:01] I said for what he said
[1:27:03] I'm going to build you a church
[1:27:06] I said well sir he said how much you
[1:27:07] need and I said oh I don't know he said
[1:27:09] couple million dollars
[1:27:10] I said no sir not even close
[1:27:13] and I did have a piece of property I got
[1:27:16] home and I figured out what the price
[1:27:17] would be and I went and seen him and
[1:27:19] told him what I needed and he wrote a
[1:27:22] check out 450 000 dollars
[1:27:25] said you'd go build your church
[1:27:27] had to go down the attorney's office for
[1:27:28] some of the Brethren from our church
[1:27:29] signed the papers the attorney said what
[1:27:32] organization you're with what
[1:27:34] denomination said we don't have one he
[1:27:36] said where's your minutes I said we

[1:27:42] papers I said call the banker and tell
[1:27:44] him he called the banker right there in
[1:27:45] the room with us and the banker told him
[1:27:47] said you'll either sign those papers or
[1:27:49] I'll never send you any more business
[1:27:51] he got the phone so I've never done this
[1:27:53] but I'm not losing that man's business
[1:27:55] and he signed the papers for us we built
[1:27:58] a church I went by the office one day I
[1:28:01] said let me ask you something why'd you
[1:28:03] do all this for me and I kept trying
[1:28:05] some way to get to him
[1:28:06] and he said I'll tell you Luke why I did
[1:28:09] it he said any man that would treat my
[1:28:11] son the way you did I'll do anything for
[1:28:14] you
[1:28:15] and brother as soon as in words how much
[1:28:17] amount of light turned on and I said
[1:28:19] brother I said that's what I've been
[1:28:21] trying to tell you he said what I said
[1:28:23] just what you said you said if I'd done
[1:28:25] anything for your son you'd do anything
[1:28:26] for me he said yes I said that's exactly
[1:28:28] the way God feels if you receive his son
[1:28:31] he'll do anything for you
[1:28:34] tear rolled out his face he hugged me I
[1:28:37] walked out about three or four months
[1:28:39] later I got a call on the phone it was
[1:28:41] him on the other end his voice was broke
[1:28:44] up he said Luke I said yes he said I
[1:28:46] wanted you to be the first to know I
[1:28:48] gave my heart back to the Lord
[1:28:51] come on church Someone said does he see
[1:28:54] this message no but that don't mean he
[1:28:56] won't
[1:28:59] I didn't cram the message down this road
[1:29:01] I didn't cram what we bleed down his
[1:29:04] throat I just tried to be Christ to him
[1:29:06] present Christ to him and I
[1:29:09] I know if it's a true repentance and a
[1:29:11] true Faith then I know one thing the god
[1:29:13] that dealt with him to lead him and
[1:29:14] guide him into all truth
[1:29:17] hey they're not we didn't say them God
[1:29:20] did and God takes responsibility for his
[1:29:23] own children
[1:29:24] can you say praise the lord well let me
[1:29:27] get back to my message so this little
[1:29:29] girl went to school
[1:29:31] and they were asking her if she still
[1:29:33] had her virginity
[1:29:34] he said yes they mocked her and made fun
[1:29:37] of him she'd go home in the evening
[1:29:39] she'd be crying one day she was sitting
[1:29:40] at the supper table she was weeping her
[1:29:43] daddy came and sat down said what's
[1:29:45] wrong honey she said Daddy I'm tired
[1:29:47] tired of what I'm tired of being made
[1:29:49] fun of
[1:29:51] daddy they've all gave up their
[1:29:53] virginity and I still got mine but
[1:29:54] they're mocking me and making fun of me
[1:29:56] he said you go pray and talk to God
[1:29:57] about it
[1:29:58] she went in the room and she prayed
[1:30:01] while she was praying the lord gave her
[1:30:03] something
[1:30:04] she went back to school and they started
[1:30:06] making fun of her when she did she said
[1:30:08] something and the lord gave her and they
[1:30:11] never bothered her again you know what
[1:30:12] she said she said let me tell you
[1:30:14] something girls
[1:30:15] any day of the week I can become what
[1:30:18] you are but you all could never become
[1:30:21] what I am
[1:30:27] they gave it up
[1:30:31] they lost it
[1:30:32] the keppers
[1:30:34] she kept that sacred trust that God had
[1:30:37] given to her now let me bring this to
[1:30:39] what I wanted to because there's
[1:30:41] decisions that you will make now
[1:30:44] that I want you to sow the right ones
[1:30:47] and do the right thing so that when you
[1:30:49] leave your childhood and you go into
[1:30:51] adulthood and then you become married
[1:30:53] and then you become a husband or a wife
[1:30:55] and then you become a grandma or a
[1:30:57] grandpa
[1:30:58] you don't have to look down through your
[1:31:00] past and be haunted by decisions that
[1:31:03] you made
[1:31:04] when you were young
[1:31:07] how can that happen let me tell you can
[1:31:08] I have about 15 minutes how could that
[1:31:11] happen well let's borrow Samuel for just
[1:31:14] a minute
[1:31:16] Samuel was one of the greatest prophets
[1:31:17] of the Old Testament
[1:31:19] but God didn't call him when he was 30
[1:31:22] and 40.
[1:31:24] his mother kept praying for a child
[1:31:27] down the temple she prayed until she
[1:31:29] travailed until her language couldn't be
[1:31:31] understood
[1:31:33] and God opened her womb
[1:31:36] that you're with a little boy by the
[1:31:38] name of Samuel
[1:31:39] and Samuel was just a young lad she took
[1:31:42] him back down to the temple and
[1:31:44] dedicated him to God and he was raised
[1:31:46] in the temple with the priest
[1:31:50] he was a prophet but he was also a judge
[1:31:53] until Saul became king and he also
[1:31:55] performed the role of a priest
[1:31:58] and God blessed him and Sanctified him
[1:31:59] another man tried that and God struck
[1:32:01] him with leprosy
[1:32:03] God's blessings was upon Samuel
[1:32:06] saved as a little boy
[1:32:07] listen to this you say well he didn't
[1:32:09] have to oh wait wait
[1:32:12] this boy was surrounded by
[1:32:14] corruption and such filth
[1:32:16] as a little boy taking place so when he
[1:32:20] went out there in the neighborhood no
[1:32:22] right down there in the temple in the
[1:32:24] house of God
[1:32:27] Eli two boys the priest and Eli's two
[1:32:30] son Hoffman Phineas you know a little
[1:32:33] bit about them don't you
[1:32:35] started committing lewd acts
[1:32:39] unless it's sex acts preacher Sons
[1:32:42] preached his voice oh God help us help
[1:32:46] us tonight
[1:32:49] but he lived such a dedicated life
[1:32:51] separated from the world and God Favored
[1:32:54] him all the days of Life strange I was
[1:32:56] sitting at my desk there in the hotel
[1:32:59] today and brother William you put that
[1:33:00] up about anxiety
[1:33:03] now remember study on this a few years
[1:33:05] ago some of the top issues that some of
[1:33:08] our young people face
[1:33:10] Samuel faced a lot of the same things
[1:33:12] maybe different forms and different
[1:33:14] manifestations but top things that our
[1:33:16] young people face is amazing kids these
[1:33:18] age young men young ladies either
[1:33:21] dealing with depression

[1:33:36] problems
[1:33:37] peer pressure
[1:33:39] social media
[1:33:41] violence on the streams
[1:33:44] then we wonder why they got them all on
[1:33:47] drugs
[1:33:49] and after doing I'm gonna tell you what
[1:33:51] they're doing they're trying to drug
[1:33:53] demons
[1:33:56] you go around the Book of Revelation

[1:33:59] whole world by sorceries
[1:34:01] look up that word Searcher there's
[1:34:03] Pharmaca that's why we get the word
[1:34:05] Pharmaceutical
[1:34:07] drugs
[1:34:09] numbs them
[1:34:11] keeps them drugged up to the idle boy
[1:34:13] Israel
[1:34:15] Israel when he was a little fellow was
[1:34:17] hyper he was just a boy
[1:34:19] really hyper
[1:34:21] some of the people in the church said
[1:34:22] well that boy needs to be on Ritalin
[1:34:25] you know they got to drop through
[1:34:26] everything
[1:34:27] no matter if your kid's just a kid just
[1:34:29] a little bit like David was
[1:34:32] imagine if David was being raised today
[1:34:34] that kid would be stoned out of his mind
[1:34:38] according to what I heard today
[1:34:41] they drug him up
[1:34:43] and one of the deacons told me that boy
[1:34:46] needs riddling I said that kid don't
[1:34:48] need Ritalin he needs a red rear end
[1:34:53] huh Thomas we don't believe in
[1:34:56] Corporal passage you ain't got to tell
[1:34:58] us we're just around your kids a little
[1:35:00] bit and we know you don't believe in
[1:35:01] corporal punishment
[1:35:03] I didn't believe in corporal punishment
[1:35:05] I believe in capital punishment
[1:35:08] we go in the restaurant my wife would
[1:35:10] get out and all these boys look like a
[1:35:13] Mother Goose all the little chicks
[1:35:15] falling and we go in the restaurant my
[1:35:17] kids I never had to say shut your mouth
[1:35:20] be still sat down don't move people

[1:35:24] amazing how your kids are here all these
[1:35:28] boys are on this table and you've got
[1:35:29] the quietest table in this whole
[1:35:31] restaurant said thank you
[1:35:32] it's wonderful to see that so thank you
[1:35:34] and we just and they just were impressed
[1:35:37] by how good my kids were finally one day
[1:35:40] it got enough nerve to ask me how you do
[1:35:42] it I suggest before we get out the car I
[1:35:44] said boys if you act up my hand to God
[1:35:46] I'll kill you when you get home
[1:35:53] capital punishment
[1:35:55] told my boys I'll whip you till the fire
[1:35:57] alarm goes off

[1:36:06] the Core

[1:36:10] Philistines and that bunch of educated
[1:36:12] Devils teach them
[1:36:14] put their minds and mess them up and try
[1:36:17] to tell them they can make decisions
[1:36:19] what sex they are
[1:36:21] how in God's name ever heard such
[1:36:24] ridiculous nonsense that's just straight
[1:36:26] up out of hell
[1:36:29] man you young people don't decide what
[1:36:31] sex you are that was decided by almighty
[1:36:34] God when the sea neck came together and
[1:36:36] you come out of the womb he said boy
[1:36:38] girl
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:41] two dinners male and female I don't care
[1:36:43] what these bunch of crackpots tell you
[1:36:46] flies out of hell
[1:36:49] now we got a bunch of masking girls a
[1:36:51] bunch of feminine boys cause there's
[1:36:53] confusion Mom and Daddy protect your
[1:36:56] kids from them false doctrines and the
[1:36:58] Devils that's in the education system
[1:37:02] rotten to the core and duck they the
[1:37:05] mines until we have a whole generation
[1:37:07] excuse me that are devil possessed
[1:37:10] [Music]
[1:37:12] education's taking them farther and
[1:37:14] farther away from God
[1:37:16] to the devil possess not all not all not
[1:37:19] all but most
[1:37:26] praise God
[1:37:28] let me talk to you just a minute got
[1:37:30] about three or four points to you number
[1:37:32] one
[1:37:33] tell you what's different about Samuel
[1:37:36] Samuel had learned
[1:37:39] to respond to God
[1:37:41] the first time God dealt with him
[1:37:45] one day he was there and laying down and
[1:37:48] first Samuel 1 and 2 and
[1:37:51] Mama dropped him off dedicated to God
[1:37:53] and he was laying there and all of a
[1:37:54] sudden he hears something that says
[1:37:56] Samuel
[1:38:00] Samuel said yes Lord or yes yes here
[1:38:04] here am I Jeremiah
[1:38:06] because you got to realize first time
[1:38:08] God speaks to you may not be able to
[1:38:10] acknowledge whose voice that is
[1:38:14] well he went and got up and he went down
[1:38:17] to Eli and Eli Tom said go lay back down
[1:38:20] it wasn't for me you're gonna lay back
[1:38:21] down he lay down and hear it come again
[1:38:23] Samuel
[1:38:27] went to the priest could you call no
[1:38:28] Samuel go back lay down this time
[1:38:32] if you hear him call your name
[1:38:36] all you have to say is
[1:38:38] here am I
[1:38:41] for thy servant heareth
[1:38:45] isn't that good
[1:38:46] young person
[1:38:48] do you realize three times God spoke to
[1:38:51] him at the third time something
[1:38:52] penetrated into Samuel's soul
[1:38:55] there's mind and the spirit that you
[1:38:57] read the rest of the Bible and read the
[1:38:59] rest of
[1:39:00] the biography of of Samuel's life God
[1:39:05] never had to call his name more than
[1:39:07] once
[1:39:09] God never had to speak more than once
[1:39:12] the first time God would speak to Samuel
[1:39:15] Samuel would respond to the call of God
[1:39:18] from a child to an old man but never was
[1:39:21] a time that God had to speak twice
[1:39:24] he became familiar with that voice
[1:39:28] let me just tell you something I know
[1:39:30] the voice of God is on the tape don't
[1:39:32] get me wrong I know that but don't you
[1:39:34] ever let nobody convince you that
[1:39:36] doesn't individually speak to you
[1:39:40] some of you young people last night
[1:39:42] something spoke to your heart and you
[1:39:44] come down the order some of you they
[1:39:45] didn't come to our god you still spoke
[1:39:46] to your heart how many of you y'all be
[1:39:47] believed God spoke to your heart last
[1:39:49] night you just felt something all right
[1:39:51] remember that voice
[1:39:56] that ain't the devil telling you to come
[1:39:58] down here just remember how it was when
[1:40:01] you respond to that voice and every time
[1:40:03] that voice comes don't push it off
[1:40:09] one day you may be sitting in your room
[1:40:10] and all of a sudden the Temptation will
[1:40:12] come and you'll hear that boy say don't
[1:40:14] do that stop right there
[1:40:17] listen to that voice the first time they
[1:40:19] talked to you because that voice is
[1:40:21] leading you in God I knew and it's
[1:40:23] shaving you from trouble that's down the
[1:40:26] road
[1:40:29] I have a sister
[1:40:31] I hope you're not listening tonight you
[1:40:33] do I love you facts are facts
[1:40:36] I was a 16 year old boy I believe about
[1:40:39] that age I was up in Cleveland Ohio
[1:40:42] my sister and I were bumping heads over
[1:40:44] decisions that she was making maybe I
[1:40:46] was a little older maybe I was 17 18.
[1:40:47] she we were bumping heads
[1:40:49] she was making decisions that was
[1:40:51] contrary causing trouble in my father
[1:40:53] and mother's home
[1:40:56] I don't know
[1:40:57] I would
[1:40:59] I would sharply speak to her I went into
[1:41:01] the room in my aunt's house and I was
[1:41:03] kneeling down praying
[1:41:05] something spoke to me said I want you to
[1:41:07] get up and go call your sister
[1:41:09] and I want you to tell her in a
[1:41:12] respectful nice way
[1:41:14] don't do what she's about to do
[1:41:17] she will pay for her decision
[1:41:20] I didn't have no more clue what she had
[1:41:21] in mind and nothing but I know something
[1:41:23] spoke to me I got up and went in the
[1:41:26] living room I said Dad I said you think
[1:41:28] and I called my aunt's name she'd mind
[1:41:30] if I borrowed the telephone my ass said
[1:41:31] I said no no problem call go ahead do
[1:41:33] what you want to do and I called the
[1:41:35] house and when I did
[1:41:38] my sister picked up
[1:41:41] and when she did I said Tammy
[1:41:43] should have called it I'm sorry but I
[1:41:44] did to Tammy and she threw the phone
[1:41:48] and I said hello hello my mom picked it
[1:41:50] up
[1:41:51] she said Luke what's going on I said Mom
[1:41:56] something spoke to me just a moment ago
[1:41:58] and told me to call my sister and tell
[1:42:01] her in a respectful nice way not to do
[1:42:04] what she's about to do because she will
[1:42:07] pay for it down the road
[1:42:09] my sister when she heard my voice
[1:42:12] through the phone and started screaming
[1:42:13] that's why I was wondering what was
[1:42:15] going on my mother said Luke
[1:42:17] just before that phone rang your sister
[1:42:20] looked at me and said of Luke whatever
[1:42:22] tell me a respectful nice way I would
[1:42:25] listen
[1:42:28] and I said something told me I said put
[1:42:30] her on the phone and he put her on the
[1:42:32] phone I said Tammy I love you but he
[1:42:34] told me to tell you whatever it is that
[1:42:36] you're about to do don't you do it
[1:42:38] you'll pay for it down the road
[1:42:41] before my father I ever got back see she
[1:42:44] didn't want to take that as really she
[1:42:46] did at the moment penetrator but then
[1:42:49] what she did she pushed that voice off
[1:42:51] don't ever push that voice off
[1:42:54] she puts that voice up that night she
[1:42:57] crawled out the window and went with
[1:42:58] some boy he got married by the justice
[1:43:01] of peace
[1:43:04] winded up in a divorce
[1:43:06] ended up with another man had a baby out
[1:43:08] of wedlock in love with another man had
[1:43:10] another baby
[1:43:12] and today she's still weeping for one
[1:43:15] day decision she made against the voice
[1:43:19] about to her life
[1:43:22] do I love her with all my heart I do but
[1:43:26] truth is truth
[1:43:29] and it's like she told me few when 9 11
[1:43:31] happened you remember that happened my
[1:43:34] that morning my phone was ringing off
[1:43:36] the hook I wasn't going to answer it
[1:43:38] because people I knew was one of them
[1:43:40] was her and she was waiting to hear my
[1:43:42] voice and I almost said picked up said
[1:43:45] hello you reached the Gibson house we're
[1:43:47] not here the Rapture has just happened
[1:43:51] because I knew what she was thinking and
[1:43:52] when I actually said oh thank God I
[1:43:54] thought the Lord Jesus had already come
[1:43:56] back
[1:43:57] you don't have to live that way
[1:44:00] you shouldn't have to worry about
[1:44:01] somebody else getting out of here you
[1:44:02] can live for God till you know if he
[1:44:04] comes I'm going with him if anybody's
[1:44:06] going to help tonight I'm going
[1:44:11] I told her I said it wouldn't have
[1:44:13] mattered you gotta but what it is she
[1:44:16] this is her words I feel trapped
[1:44:19] Satan keeps bringing the walls in the
[1:44:21] wall when you push that voice up and
[1:44:23] push that I got a whole message I preach
[1:44:25] on conscience how it's a gift of God and
[1:44:27] how God uses that conscience
[1:44:31] she pushed it off and pushed it off her
[1:44:33] life today seemed like it's on a path
[1:44:35] that she don't know how to turn around
[1:44:38] if it gets turned around it'll take
[1:44:40] almighty God to turn it around I can't
[1:44:42] do it my mother couldn't do it my father
[1:44:44] couldn't do it nobody else could do it
[1:44:46] if it's going to get done it'll take God
[1:44:48] or it'll never be done
[1:44:51] in other words you can go so far that
[1:44:54] you wreck your life up I got another
[1:44:55] cousin of mine
[1:44:57] God used him mightily wrote songs and
[1:45:00] played the piano just mightily
[1:45:02] started getting involved with
[1:45:04] pornography so this was the days where
[1:45:06] we had to go buy the magazines one thing
[1:45:09] led to another let's tell you something
[1:45:10] sin will take you farther than you'll
[1:45:13] want to go
[1:45:13] it'll cost you more than you want to pay
[1:45:16] took him so far until he winded up
[1:45:19] committing acts and prostitutes and
[1:45:22] different
[1:45:23] knew there was something different about
[1:45:24] him
[1:45:25] but all of a sudden he picked up a
[1:45:27] disease
[1:45:28] back then it was called AIDS
[1:45:33] they buried him one day
[1:45:35] broke the mother's heart
[1:45:38] all because he he said that voice told
[1:45:41] him not to do it warned him the first
[1:45:42] time he ever done it and he pushed that
[1:45:44] voice off he kept going and what happens
[1:45:46] after a while you create a web
[1:45:48] and you get caught in that web I thought
[1:45:51] it was always amazing when the internet
[1:45:53] came out they called it the world www
[1:45:56] the worldwide
[1:45:59] web
[1:46:01] to get you in there
[1:46:04] like brother random said at times not
[1:46:05] just think of this
[1:46:07] my wife and I was flying to South Africa
[1:46:10] one time she was scared the plane
[1:46:13] started trembling so what's wrong with
[1:46:14] you she I can feel her tensing up
[1:46:17] she felt like his things on a wreck I
[1:46:19] said you might as well die happy
[1:46:22] and why go down all stiff like a board
[1:46:27] just go down praise the Lord
[1:46:30] because we can't do nothing about it now
[1:46:32] ain't no stopping the area on that ocean
[1:46:35] I said Ain't No Stopping place we gotta
[1:46:37] go we got to go back
[1:46:39] we just kept going I said just relax
[1:46:40] it'll be all right
[1:46:42] he said I'm scared when that happens I
[1:46:44] said look if God could keep a plane down
[1:46:47] he could sure keep a plane up
[1:46:51] tell you something Mama I'm gonna land
[1:46:53] your mama Stand Out by that gate you
[1:46:55] remember that her black son in there on
[1:46:57] the bed he had the same thing I told
[1:46:59] blood of him said he caught her venereal
[1:47:01] disease from living a a a a wrong kind
[1:47:04] of life
[1:47:06] he was dying Saul was out there you know
[1:47:08] like on a ship and just groaning and
[1:47:10] groaning and there stood that little
[1:47:12] widow woman waiting that morning for
[1:47:14] Elijah to come out
[1:47:16] glad you came by glory to God hello
[1:47:20] Parson she got to talk and they went in
[1:47:22] there God held that plane up for one
[1:47:24] mother that had a desire to see her son
[1:47:26] saved but that shame God was here
[1:47:29] tonight he'll do it for her he'll do it
[1:47:31] for you
[1:47:32] my daughter's away I don't care where
[1:47:34] your daughter is God Will Make A Way
[1:47:36] when there seems to be no way you know
[1:47:38] how far my son is I don't care how far
[1:47:40] your son is I know how big God is
[1:47:48] it takes God seconds to turn a man and a
[1:47:51] woman's life around
[1:47:54] the man should not win an air and I told
[1:47:57] her to pray
[1:47:59] brother she got to pray
[1:48:01] you remember what happened the spirit of
[1:48:02] God came in there
[1:48:04] brother in the Lord turn that boy around
[1:48:06] brother bam said some time later
[1:48:09] come to a meeting hello Parson Branham

[1:48:27] die in thy house shall be saved
[1:48:34] let me say it one more time
[1:48:36] don't silence that voice
[1:48:39] respond to God the first time he speaks
[1:48:42] to you
[1:48:43] you'll be amazed at the trouble
[1:48:45] it'll keep out of your life you'll be at
[1:48:48] the scars that you will not have to deal
[1:48:50] with down the road number two listen to
[1:48:52] this
[1:48:53] run from sin as fast as you can
[1:48:59] let me tell you why I say that Samuel
[1:49:01] was living the temple with Eli Eli's
[1:49:04] voice as I said was committing
[1:49:05] fornication in the house of God it was
[1:49:08] sickening what was taking place
[1:49:09] Samuel was a young boy
[1:49:11] he was a young boy guess what he never
[1:49:13] know Daddy and Mommy around
[1:49:16] nope
[1:49:17] the preacher's kids was all messed up
[1:49:19] imagine the pressure
[1:49:21] that must have been on Samuel not fine
[1:49:23] Phineas he sons of Eli come on Samuel
[1:49:27] everybody's doing it
[1:49:29] nobody's going to find out
[1:49:32] dashboard too laid back to Blind
[1:49:37] all he is is a figurehead now we do
[1:49:40] things that he doesn't even know what's
[1:49:41] going on
[1:49:42] till the Bible said there was no open
[1:49:44] vision air the lamp of the Lord the
[1:49:46] light the Lord had went out
[1:49:48] the church had got into a backslid
[1:49:51] condition and when they got in the
[1:49:52] backstory condition sin started coming
[1:49:53] into the church
[1:49:56] I can imagine though Samuel's sitting
[1:49:57] there looks at off nine Fitness and the
[1:50:00] rest of that crowd so let me tell y'all
[1:50:01] something I've been here since a child

[1:50:54] going to church that's a that's a
[1:50:56] ridiculous question that's on Wednesday
[1:50:58] we're going to church we build our lives
[1:51:02] around going to church Sunday come we
[1:51:04] went to church you've been to church

[1:51:08] years old always live in my house you'll
[1:51:10] always go twice on Sunday once on with
[1:51:12] and if we have Revival you'll be there
[1:51:14] every night
[1:51:15] that wasn't the question our own that's
[1:51:18] a silly question that's asking Christian
[1:51:20] homes are we going to church
[1:51:23] That Man Who Loved God will fill the
[1:51:25] seat his seat every time them doors are
[1:51:27] open if he loves God matter of fact he
[1:51:29] said if he really loves God he can't
[1:51:31] wait for them Church doors get open so
[1:51:33] he can get out there and fellowship amen
[1:51:37] is that right
[1:51:38] let me singing that we used to sing oh
[1:51:40] when a saints come marching in now we're
[1:51:42] seeing all in the same come dragon in
[1:51:48] Samuel looked at himself and tell you
[1:51:49] some boys I'm not here like here you're
[1:51:52] here because your dad is a preacher
[1:51:54] I'm not here like you're here I'm here
[1:51:56] because I want to be here there's
[1:51:57] something in my heart wants to serve God
[1:51:59] I'm going to tell you something I don't
[1:52:01] care what everybody else is doing I know
[1:52:02] what the word of God says and I'm not
[1:52:05] going to do anything while I'm 15 16 17
[1:52:07] and 18 that I'm going to weep over when
[1:52:10] I get 25 and 30.
[1:52:12] you do what you want to do but I'm going
[1:52:15] to run from it I'm not associating with
[1:52:18] it because you know what he found out if
[1:52:19] he laid down with the dogs he's going to
[1:52:21] catch fleas he'll be hung around with
[1:52:23] skunks after a while he's gonna stink
[1:52:26] so he was willing to run from sin as
[1:52:30] fast as he could and he ran from it I'm
[1:52:33] going to tell you something else while
[1:52:34] he ran from it one day down the
[1:52:36] battlefield why them boys are laying on
[1:52:38] the battlefield in their own blood
[1:52:40] Samuel was at church worshiping God
[1:52:46] while they died in sin read the Bible
[1:52:48] they died of disgrace they died under
[1:52:51] the Judgment of God
[1:52:52] when his daughter-in-law come back and
[1:52:54] totally lie he was so big he fell over
[1:52:57] backwards and died
[1:52:59] while all the sin and the corruption and
[1:53:02] the compromise what's going on Samuel
[1:53:04] was running from sin he was responding
[1:53:07] to the voice and he was running from sin
[1:53:13] the Bible tells you young people
[1:53:15] flee flee fornication
[1:53:19] Paul told Timothy flee youthful lust
[1:53:24] then Mercury said fleas for fuss he used
[1:53:27] the word follow after flee this and
[1:53:29] follow after this it doesn't fully
[1:53:31] useful love follow after righteous Faith
[1:53:33] charity peace with them that call upon
[1:53:36] the name of the Lord out of pure heart
[1:53:37] the word flee literally means to shun
[1:53:40] and avoid my fight run for your life
[1:53:46] let me give you an example
[1:53:49] by the name of Joseph
[1:53:52] young fella
[1:53:54] handsome
[1:53:56] look God blesses you with looks
[1:53:59] use it for him
[1:54:02] don't let Satan turn that thing on you
[1:54:04] and put pride in your heart and you
[1:54:07] think you're a ladies man
[1:54:09] or you've got Beauty as a young girl and
[1:54:12] you let the devil use it to sway men
[1:54:15] the way you think you can God didn't
[1:54:17] give you a body to send soul
[1:54:20] he'd give you a body to glorify him with
[1:54:26] like one girl complained walk down the
[1:54:28] road with her cleavage hanging out in
[1:54:31] her bottom of her rear end hanging out
[1:54:33] of her shorts and got raped
[1:54:36] and I don't think a man should do that
[1:54:38] is a beast that does that but the point
[1:54:40] is if what you've got isn't for sale
[1:54:42] quit advertising it
[1:54:46] but of them said they'll stand on the
[1:54:48] dead judgment for calls and men to
[1:54:51] commit adultery you boys get enough Holy
[1:54:53] Ghost about you when you can't look left
[1:54:55] you can't look right you can't look for
[1:54:57] him you can't look backward look up
[1:54:59] keep your eyes on Christ
[1:55:03] Joseph went down there must have been a
[1:55:05] nice young man maybe her husband taught
[1:55:07] it for his wife her husband's too busy
[1:55:10] and he happened to be in the house and
[1:55:11] she come up there and maybe lonely maybe
[1:55:14] she had a little fuss that morning and
[1:55:16] here's a young man nice looking but he's
[1:55:18] a man of God
[1:55:20] Satan thought he would get him
[1:55:23] right she come to him
[1:55:26] she wanted him
[1:55:28] but he had enough thought about him you
[1:55:31] know what he did he run
[1:55:36] he run
[1:55:39] what's your name young man
[1:55:42] yeah

[1:55:49] Joseph had his coat on
[1:55:52] when that woman come after him
[1:55:54] I want you to run to your seat go
[1:55:57] this coat gone
[1:55:59] he lost his coat
[1:56:01] but he kept his character
[1:56:05] she stole this coat but she couldn't get
[1:56:08] his character he held that character
[1:56:11] young person when you run from sin they
[1:56:14] might get your coat they may tell a lie
[1:56:16] but God knows in the end your character
[1:56:18] holds still
[1:56:19] [Applause]

[1:56:27] righteousness and faith and charity and
[1:56:29] peace

[1:56:33] the Lord's surround yourself with people
[1:56:35] that's got the same desires and the same
[1:56:37] appetite you got if you got people in
[1:56:39] your life that's trying to get you to
[1:56:41] sin run from them
[1:56:43] you got people and I'll get you in a
[1:56:45] second but you got people trying to get
[1:56:46] you to do things that's conjure this
[1:56:47] message run from it run

[1:56:53] soul is at stake your future is a stake
[1:56:56] your life is at stake you don't want to
[1:56:59] end up in this life with scars all over
[1:57:01] you because the decisions you make now
[1:57:04] because I'm lost
[1:57:07] remember this I'm gonna set to you boys
[1:57:10] and you girls the right place the right
[1:57:13] time with the right people you can do
[1:57:15] things in your life that will scar you
[1:57:16] later on and you remember Blackness plus
[1:57:20] opportunity equals shame
[1:57:27] stay in the light
[1:57:29] so
[1:57:31] responding the first time he calls
[1:57:33] run from sin Let me give you the third
[1:57:35] one refine your conversation
[1:57:39] what I mean by that well here's what the
[1:57:41] Bible said Samuel grew in the Lord's
[1:57:43] with him and did let none of his words
[1:57:46] fall to the ground
[1:57:49] his conversations were pure
[1:57:52] they were Godly they were holy I'm going
[1:57:54] to tell you something
[1:57:55] if you think dirty
[1:57:57] you'll talk dirty
[1:58:00] and if you talk dirty you will live
[1:58:02] dirty
[1:58:05] I told my boys their whole lives I
[1:58:08] preached Proverbs 3 to them over and
[1:58:10] over about the woman that met him in the
[1:58:13] streets and how with her eyes
[1:58:15] stares him down used to be girls
[1:58:17] wouldn't do that
[1:58:19] wouldn't stand there and just keep her
[1:58:20] eye Right In Another Man's eyes and just
[1:58:23] stare him that didn't used to be that
[1:58:24] way
[1:58:25] they had a little bit of Shame they had
[1:58:28] a little bit of uh what's the other word
[1:58:30] they lose their modesty
[1:58:36] then they're willing to talk like the
[1:58:38] world talks you just remember your
[1:58:40] tongue is like a spoon it'll dip down to
[1:58:42] the bucket of your heart will spew out
[1:58:44] what's really in there
[1:58:46] at the bun of the heart the mouth will
[1:58:48] speak your conversation is wrong your
[1:58:51] life will become wrong
[1:58:56] keep your heart your mind conversation
[1:58:58] I'll say it like Brother Band for a
[1:59:00] second I could read a lot of quotes but
[1:59:01] I just need to preach it go no place
[1:59:04] that you wouldn't be found if Jesus
[1:59:05] should come
[1:59:07] be saying nothing
[1:59:09] that you would not want to say if Jesus
[1:59:11] should come
[1:59:13] it's pretty simple
[1:59:15] that three little monkeys one cover in
[1:59:17] his eyes
[1:59:18] when Covenant is here do you remember
[1:59:20] that See No Evil
[1:59:22] say no evil do no evil
[1:59:25] do what's right
[1:59:27] With Every Idle Word and we'll give an
[1:59:29] account for number four
[1:59:32] refuse
[1:59:33] to ever
[1:59:35] compromise
[1:59:37] get your convictions in your heart
[1:59:39] you list these tapes and you hear
[1:59:41] Brother bam say things even things that
[1:59:43] you don't
[1:59:44] I necessarily understand why brother
[1:59:46] Brandon would save
[1:59:48] let me tell you something you don't have
[1:59:50] to fully understand to have The
[1:59:52] Obedience of faith
[1:59:55] believing and obedience believing
[1:59:58] obedience is a prerequisite to God given
[2:00:01] you understanding do you think whether
[2:00:02] you understand or not if the if the word
[2:00:04] of God says it do it
[2:00:07] later on God might give you an
[2:00:08] understanding why he had you to do
[2:00:10] certain things but if God ask it just do
[2:00:13] it
[2:00:16] refuse to compromise
[2:00:18] let me just tell you this quickly you
[2:00:19] got one more and I'll let you go
[2:00:22] Samuel had a friend
[2:00:25] he was a very close Covenant in Ministry
[2:00:29] matter of fact the only one we know that
[2:00:31] Samuel was close to
[2:00:33] it was the man that became the first
[2:00:35] king of Israel and his name was Saul
[2:00:39] Samuel was the one that took the Horn of
[2:00:41] oil symbol of the Holy Ghost and
[2:00:43] anointed him to be king
[2:00:46] Samuel was the one who offered up
[2:00:48] sacrifices while the armies went against
[2:00:50] their enemies
[2:00:52] their Ministries went hand in hand while
[2:00:54] Saul was in battle Samuel offered the
[2:00:57] sacrifices one day God spoke to Saul
[2:01:01] and he told Saul in the battle kill
[2:01:04] every amlicite
[2:01:08] now that been Samuel
[2:01:10] he would have took them all out
[2:01:13] Saul thought I'll Kill Them All
[2:01:16] but I'll just leave one of them alive
[2:01:19] you remember that
[2:01:21] he left one alive
[2:01:23] Saul disobeyed God
[2:01:25] that the king alive and
[2:01:28] Samuel came back and he rebuked Saul
[2:01:32] make a long story short let me tell you
[2:01:34] what he said behold it is better
[2:01:37] to obey than a sacrifice
[2:01:39] to hearken than the fat of Rams for
[2:01:42] Rebellion is a sin of Witchcraft and
[2:01:44] stubbornness is Iniquity and idolatry
[2:01:46] because thou has rejected the word of
[2:01:48] the Lord he had also ejected thee from
[2:01:50] being a King Samuel rebuked him sternly
[2:01:55] what was he doing listen listen
[2:01:57] disagreeing with his best friend
[2:02:01] why because Samuel refused to compromise
[2:02:05] he could have said you know what me and
[2:02:07] you've been close a long time we've been
[2:02:10] towels we've been buddies and
[2:02:12] I know God told you not to do that but
[2:02:14] you know
[2:02:16] I don't want to come against you I want
[2:02:18] our relationship to continue and he
[2:02:19] could have compromised he would have
[2:02:21] paid a great price
[2:02:24] Saul compromised Samuel let me finish
[2:02:27] the story for you
[2:02:28] the malachites were a type of the flesh
[2:02:31] God told him you killed every thing of
[2:02:34] the flesh don't you leave one alive
[2:02:37] if you read the rest of the story Samuel
[2:02:39] came and Samuel cut the results of that
[2:02:43] Disobedience cut him up in pieces name
[2:02:45] was egg egg
[2:02:48] and you know what he's saying not
[2:02:49] compromising Saul said come on let's go
[2:02:52] worship he said I'm not worshiping with
[2:02:53] you I'm not compromising with you that's
[2:02:55] what he told him I'm not I'm not going
[2:02:57] down the words matter of fact he said
[2:02:59] this you will not even see my face no
[2:03:02] more until you die
[2:03:07] you read first Samuel 15 35
[2:03:10] Saul never seen Samuel again
[2:03:14] his death
[2:03:16] now watch this
[2:03:17] do you know
[2:03:19] what it was that ended up killing Saul
[2:03:24] the seed of the man he left alive
[2:03:28] what he refused to obey God in is what
[2:03:32] caused him his life he left an amicide
[2:03:34] alive that little thing he left alive
[2:03:36] produced and it's what ended up taking
[2:03:38] Saul's life
[2:03:40] what's God telling us don't you ever
[2:03:42] compromise with sin don't you compromise
[2:03:45] at all if God tells you to get something
[2:03:47] rid of something in your life it may be
[2:03:49] a little just obey God
[2:03:51] I tell you why because it's better
[2:03:53] because that little thing you think is
[2:03:54] so insignificant little babies little
[2:03:56] hammockites hope to be dig something big
[2:03:59] little things that you let go undone
[2:04:01] that God's asked you to get rid of they
[2:04:03] grow big and if you don't kill it it
[2:04:05] will kill you
[2:04:09] don't compromise
[2:04:15] finally
[2:04:18] recruit about your life
[2:04:21] young people be an influence for Christ
[2:04:25] let me tell what I mean by that
[2:04:28] Samuel mourned
[2:04:30] he mourned
[2:04:32] don't think because he didn't he you
[2:04:35] know you think you're a preacher like
[2:04:36] maybe your pastor your strike against
[2:04:37] something brother if you're like
[2:04:38] anything like me and I have to preach
[2:04:40] certain things in my church you ask my
[2:04:41] wife I don't go home and say well I
[2:04:43] really knelt sometimes I go home broken
[2:04:45] why did I have to say that I I get so
[2:04:47] tired of saying stuff like that
[2:04:50] Samuel because he wouldn't compromise
[2:04:53] best friend Saul dies and he knew why he
[2:04:56] died he knew his Disobedience took him
[2:04:58] there
[2:04:59] and the Bible said Samuel mourned
[2:05:02] oversaw
[2:05:04] finally God got tired of his Mourning
[2:05:07] God came to himself how long will you
[2:05:09] mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected
[2:05:12] him from reigning over Israel
[2:05:14] filled on high 9 horned with oil and
[2:05:19] gold and I will send thee to Jesse to
[2:05:21] Bethlehem I like for I have provided me
[2:05:23] a king among his sons
[2:05:25] because he wouldn't compromise God still
[2:05:29] permitted him to be an influence on
[2:05:31] another king let me just say this to
[2:05:33] young people if you'll do what I'm
[2:05:34] telling them little principles I taught
[2:05:36] and you'll never compromise God will use
[2:05:38] you for good for his kingdom
[2:05:40] he'll help influence others for Christ
[2:05:45] what happened he went down there brother
[2:05:47] he was so
[2:05:48] in tune with God
[2:05:51] went down there he knew to go to Jeffy
[2:05:53] the Jesse the bethlehemite went down to
[2:05:56] Bethlehem and there you know Samuel
[2:05:58] walked up come and style peaceably said
[2:06:00] I'm coming in peace
[2:06:02] I need a son where's your sons pull all
[2:06:05] them big looking fellas out there and
[2:06:08] Samuel just stood there waiting on God
[2:06:09] he could have picked any of them Head
[2:06:11] and Shoulders big old Warriors he could
[2:06:13] have used any of them but he waited on
[2:06:15] God
[2:06:17] and all of a sudden said do you have any
[2:06:18] more well I have one but surely you
[2:06:20] couldn't be talking to him
[2:06:22] little Shepherd boy on the backside of
[2:06:25] the desert taking care of sheep oh
[2:06:27] that's the kind of men God can use one
[2:06:29] God was training him out there to take
[2:06:31] care of sheep one line tried to kill it
[2:06:33] bear tried to kill it he was protecting
[2:06:35] God you fought me God but usually
[2:06:37] protect his Nation
[2:06:40] oh at least little as much if God is in
[2:06:45] it labor not for wealth nor Fame there's
[2:06:50] a crown and you can win it if you go in
[2:06:54] Jesus name
[2:06:58] come down there David come up the spirit
[2:07:01] of God said
[2:07:02] that's him Samuel
[2:07:05] saying sound of the anointed Saul
[2:07:09] same sounding known as Saul
[2:07:11] same Samuel they wouldn't compromise
[2:07:13] with Saul here he is again influencing
[2:07:17] another man from the kingdom of God
[2:07:19] if you compromise you'll kill your
[2:07:21] influence on others
[2:07:24] you let the bars down and I'm gonna tell
[2:07:26] you something I feel this way right here
[2:07:28] tonight if my life gets to a place that

[2:07:34] I live to influence people for this
[2:07:38] great message in this great gospel that

[2:17:12] amen praise the Lord
[2:17:15] amen I believe that is
[2:17:18] amen I just I don't really know how to
[2:17:20] do this
[2:17:22] explain that but that's the most
[2:17:25] important message that you guys will
[2:17:26] probably hear amen because that'll help
[2:17:29] you make the right choices
[2:17:31] every scriptural example that was giving
[2:17:33] given
[2:17:35] amen by people in the Bible amen
[2:17:39] and it's so important to make those
[2:17:41] right choices amen because amen it's a
[2:17:45] blessed way or it's a very cursed way
[2:17:47] and your whole life depends on how many
[2:17:49] appreciate that message amen God bless
[2:17:52] you amen let's give the Lord a hand say
[2:17:53] thank you Lord Jesus
[2:18:04] amen remember that
[2:18:07] every day I don't never forget it
[2:18:10] amen
[2:18:11] the one thing you know I I'll just say
[2:18:14] is I gave my heart to the Lord at around
[2:18:17] 20 years old amen I'm 60 now and that's
[2:18:20] one decision amen because I never regret
[2:18:23] making
[2:18:24] and the other part is I mean like our
[2:18:27] brother said when God speaks through
[2:18:28] your heart he does something amen he
[2:18:31] changes you for a lifetime amen and you
[2:18:34] never regret that that experience with
[2:18:36] almighty God so if I don't have that
[2:18:39] amen
[2:18:40] praise the Lord
[2:18:42] and man one thing by the time he sent me
[2:18:44] I believe it was or he's told me amen
[2:18:47] how that a woman I guess came up to
[2:18:49] another woman I mean no doubt this woman
[2:18:52] was pretty worldly and everything and
[2:18:54] said to this Christian lady says you
[2:18:55] know you know you don't have to dress
[2:18:57] like that to be a Christian
[2:19:00] and she thought a little bit
[2:19:03] give a good answer she says well how did
[2:19:05] you know I was a Christian
[2:19:09] how did you know
[2:19:12] [Applause]
[2:19:17] amen I thought that was good that's the
[2:19:19] truth amen
[2:19:21] praise the Lord God bless you you love
[2:19:23] the Lord
[2:19:24] he's just awesome baby God it's just
[2:19:26] awesome Amen we love him with all of our
[2:19:29] heart let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we
[2:19:31] just come before you Lord and our hearts
[2:19:33] just adores you
[2:19:35] father of how you can speak Lord still
[2:19:37] Lord your spirit has not left the church
[2:19:40] it hasn't left the world but it's still
[2:19:42] speaking to Hearts it's still guiding
[2:19:45] the young people Lord our older folks
[2:19:47] and all of us who know what it's like to
[2:19:50] make wrong choices and they have to live
[2:19:52] with the consequences Lord in the our
[2:19:55] old age and as we sit on our porches
[2:19:57] sometimes we think on the past
[2:20:00] Lord and those things still haunt us
[2:20:02] those still things still bother us they
[2:20:05] still you know we still think about
[2:20:07] those things and even though we believe
[2:20:08] we're forgiven we still regret
[2:20:11] that we didn't
[2:20:12] and Lord Jesus we ask God that you truly
[2:20:15] help these young people Lord as our
[2:20:17] brother said that Holy Spirit to keep
[2:20:19] them from ever going out there from
[2:20:21] Heaven to get those scars from Heaven to
[2:20:23] make the wrong choices
[2:20:25] but Lord I ask God that you would bless
[2:20:27] their lives Lord Jesus with happiness
[2:20:30] Lord to overflowing there's just joy
[2:20:33] unspeakable and full of Glory when you
[2:20:36] make a right choice and you follow
[2:20:37] Christ and we ask God that you help each
[2:20:40] and every young person Lord Jesus
[2:20:42] tonight father to set in their hearts
[2:20:44] God that they will always seek you Lord
[2:20:47] seek your face and listen to that still
[2:20:50] small voice
[2:20:51] and let it be something that perfectly
[2:20:55] understand Lord Jesus that's also always
[2:20:58] speaking to them keeping them from the
[2:21:00] evil Lord and guiding them into the
[2:21:02] truth and then light and life we ask
[2:21:05] these blessings in your precious name
[2:21:08] amen
