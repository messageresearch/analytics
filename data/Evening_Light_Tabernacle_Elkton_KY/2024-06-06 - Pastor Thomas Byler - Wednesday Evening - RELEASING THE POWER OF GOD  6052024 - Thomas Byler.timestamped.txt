[40:39] reveal and Quicken the word to us now
[40:41] for we ask it in the name of Jesus
[40:42] Christ amen and amen so I W to I want to
[40:47] take a quote basically and uh that I
[40:51] start it with amen and just kind of pick
[40:54] it up and and and continue a little bit
[40:58] kind of the same line that we've been
[41:01] talking amen and and that we've been
[41:04] going to but if you will turn to Psalms
[41:10] let's turn to
[41:15] Psalms amen and I'm gonna have to see
[41:18] make sure that this little edge here
[41:20] brother Tommy I'll catch my iPad amen I
[41:24] think it does just fine as long as I
[41:25] don't get crazy
[41:28] amen all
[41:31] right so in Psalms
[41:42] 42 amen I'm pretty sure brother Brad
[41:46] we're going to be able to get even to
[41:47] quotes up there amen so we're going to
[41:49] get with you on that when we get to
[41:50] things running again amen because I can
[41:53] no doubt we can get it if we can get
[41:56] script scriptures up we can get quotes
[41:58] up so praise the Lord Psalms 42 as the
[42:02] heart panteth after the water Brooks so
[42:04] panteth my soul after thee Oh God my
[42:07] soul thirsts for God for the Living God
[42:11] When shall I come and appear before thee
[42:15] Amen in Matthew
[42:19] 11 got three scriptures I think it is
[42:22] only three that I know
[42:25] of that I've got this
[42:28] evening half a dozen or so
[42:33] quotes amen things that we've heard
[42:39] before Matthew
[42:41] 11 and verse 28 come unto me all ye that
[42:45] labor and are heavy laden and I will
[42:48] give you rest take my yoke upon you and
[42:51] learn of me for I am meek and lowly in
[42:54] heart and ye shall find rest unto your
[42:58] soul for my yoke is easy and my burden
[43:01] is light may God add His blessings to
[43:03] the reading of the words you can be
[43:04] seated amen this evening amen tonight I
[43:09] want to speak about releasing releasing
[43:12] the power of God Amen and I basically
[43:15] want to begin with amen and I also kind
[43:19] of thought maybe a subtitle would be
[43:21] letting go Letting Go
[43:24] amen amen the quote I wanted to uh start
[43:28] with was one of the ones I
[43:30] read
[43:33] um last
[43:35] Sunday
[43:37] amen if I can find it that is it may
[43:41] have not sure hope it didn't rearrange
[43:47] it I thought I had it right
[43:53] there right there it is brother bam says
[43:56] it is joy unspeakable and full of glory
[43:59] amen woo I feel twice my size yes sir
[44:03] I'm home now I'm glad I'm glad that we
[44:06] come uh out aren't you happy oh my what
[44:10] God could do with this little group
[44:12] right now what he can do if he can ever
[44:15] get one person in his grip just so that
[44:19] he can hold that one
[44:21] person
[44:23] amen
[44:25] amen just so that he can hold that one
[44:28] person he can put 10,000 to flight with
[44:32] that one person with one person with
[44:35] genuine Faith he can put 10,000 Devils
[44:39] running as hard as they can go yes
[44:45] sir
[44:47] amen you know isn't it something that
[44:50] whenever you talk about God and when you
[44:52] look at God's word it's always it's
[44:55] always pretty extreme
[45:00] amen I mean he says if you can believe
[45:03] all things are possible right that's
[45:06] pretty extreme he said you know with you
[45:10] nothing shall be
[45:14] impossible that's that's
[45:16] God Amen and my concept tonight is about
[45:20] amen letting go and it'll be about you
[45:23] letting go of yourself amen and we call
[45:28] it maybe uh just a onean power just
[45:32] whatever you can do is that right
[45:34] because as long as you're doing it amen
[45:38] you can only do what you can
[45:41] do amen and if you find that it's you
[45:44] doing it most of the time as humans how
[45:47] many knows especially in the Christian
[45:50] ranks and realm if it's you that's doing
[45:53] it it's going to be a catastrophe
[45:57] it's not going to be good anyway not in
[45:59] the real maybe in the natural you might
[46:02] become a millionaire I don't know
[46:03] whatever you can do however far you can
[46:05] but into spiritual if you get your hand
[46:08] in what God's trying to do and you try
[46:11] to do things in yourself I many knows
[46:13] that's a no no it don't work not with
[46:17] God it
[46:18] don't amen so releasing the power of God
[46:21] no doubt but I thinking of of David here
[46:25] how that no doubt but d David had a
[46:27] relationship a close relationship with
[46:29] God and he had seen the power of God
[46:32] Amen I believe in another place he said
[46:34] he thirst to see his power how many
[46:37] tonight thirst and longs to see God's
[46:40] power amen and as you let go of yourself
[46:43] and and get out of the way so to speak
[46:46] then God can do a thousand times more
[46:51] than what just you could do amen one of
[46:54] the one of the first things that a
[46:56] preacher do does when he gets up here is
[46:58] he has to learn to let
[47:01] go to submit himself and you should look
[47:03] at the quotes I read under submitting

[47:17] and let God have his wonderful for we
[47:19] sing this song let go and let God have
[47:22] his wonderful
[47:24] way amen
[47:27] praise the Lord missed you all last
[47:29] weekend good to see yall amen praise the
[47:32] Lord so it's just wonderful to be back
[47:34] in the house of the Lord I'm going to
[47:35] take my time tonight would that be all
[47:37] right amen and just see if I can somehow
[47:40] try my best to convey what the Lord laid
[47:43] on my heart amen so David thirst even
[47:46] though he was close he thirst for the
[47:48] Living God you and I as a Christian we
[47:51] still thirst we still long to see more
[47:53] of the power of God and there's got to
[47:55] be a way amen that more of that power of
[47:58] God can be released in our
[48:01] lives amen and I'll tell you what just
[48:04] that little thought God brings it back I
[48:06] backslide you backslide amen and we
[48:09] preach it again blessed is thou will
[48:11] keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
[48:14] stayed on day I get still busy a lot of
[48:17] times and oh oh man remember when you
[48:18] preach that remember you've done for God
[48:20] about it and and you know you need to
[48:22] get your mind on by God again I don't
[48:24] care if you're driving down the road I
[48:26] don't care if you're work where you are
[48:27] keep it on God day and night amen and
[48:30] God will bless you with having perfect
[48:32] peace if just that can give you perfect
[48:35] peace what about the rest of
[48:40] it
[48:41] amen so praise the Lord so I thought
[48:44] about this scripture how that he said if
[48:46] he can get him in his hand now uh let's
[48:51] let's look at the other side of it for
[48:53] just a minute I know one place the
[48:54] prophet of God said that Faith or the
[48:56] word of God the sword of the word no
[48:59] matter how sharp it is no matter how
[49:01] real it is he said that sword is only as
[49:05] good as the strength and the arm of the
[49:09] one that's holding
[49:12] it a't that right I mean you know some
[49:15] people just well I got weak Faith well
[49:17] you're not going to kill very many
[49:19] Devils that way amen it's only as sharp
[49:23] and only as good as the one wielding in
[49:25] any battle everybody knows two people's
[49:27] fighting with so guess what the better
[49:29] guy amen does it better he's going to
[49:33] win amen and so that's the same way it
[49:36] is with the word of God it's you know
[49:37] word of God is sharp it'll cut it'll do
[49:39] everything but if your faith is weak and
[49:42] you can't barely even pull a thing up
[49:44] off the ground well you're probably not
[49:46] going to get very far but if you're a
[49:48] man like David doesn't matter what your
[49:50] stature or is but the great strong arm
[49:54] of faith and amen it'll bring giant down
[49:58] and that's what we
[50:00] need amen like I said Wednesday talking
[50:03] our Sunday talking about you know if all
[50:05] you have is mental Faith well that's
[50:07] that much and I still don't understand
[50:10] everything but I'm here to tell you
[50:11] brother bam says that whenever they
[50:13] applied the blood over the lentil and so
[50:15] forth they used a common weed which he
[50:17] said it's just common Faith the kind of
[50:20] faith that you have that your car's
[50:21] going to start I read back there that F
[50:24] kind of f he said you can't even move
[50:26] your finger with without having
[50:28] faith I just read it I was like wow you
[50:31] can't move your head you can't move your
[50:33] arms you can't kick with your feet
[50:35] unless you got faith he says and that's
[50:36] the kind of faith that it
[50:41] takes woo that's right praise the
[50:46] Lord but first of all we're always
[50:50] talking about you know
[50:53] ourself and wielding The Sword and and
[50:57] what what we can do and what we can
[50:59] accomplish and having on the breastplate
[51:01] and having on this and having on that
[51:02] amen putting on the whole armor of God
[51:04] and and so forth but tonight I want to
[51:07] talk to you about a little bit different
[51:09] way because I want you to understand
[51:11] that brother bamet you know that uh you
[51:14] know what what is it what is it now amen
[51:18] that's going to cause 10,000 Devils to
[51:21] run away from you as hard as they
[51:25] can doing a teaching tonight kind of
[51:28] like we did Sunday why are you so quiet
[51:31] I thought boy you really Stomp Them
[51:33] people they were thinking what kind of a
[51:35] stupid question you you know why are we
[51:37] so quiet well you that ain't telling you
[51:39] nothing i' have been out there for while
[51:41] I haven't got a clue why you're so
[51:43] quiet let's talk about a box wagon maybe
[51:46] being full or something I can tell you
[51:48] then why you know might be a little more
[51:50] quiet you know if you're full and you
[51:51] know and so forth like brother bam said
[51:54] but anyway the so de question is
[51:56] question tonight is what puts it on on
[51:59] the run is it your ability is your faith
[52:02] that you have is the weapons that you
[52:05] have
[52:08] no no brother bam said if he can get one
[52:13] person in his
[52:16] grip if he can get and he can get a hold
[52:19] of one person nothing when God grabs a
[52:22] hold of you and you become the
[52:28] weapon you are God's weapon that God
[52:31] uses to bring 10,000 and that's exactly
[52:34] right look back in the scriptures and
[52:36] find out it was one man by the name of
[52:38] Moses when he come into surrenderance to
[52:40] God Amen would let go of himself and
[52:43] forgot about all of his can't talk can't
[52:45] do this can't do that Amen Let Go of all
[52:48] that and did what God said he put the
[52:49] whole Egyptian Army amen down into the
[52:52] red say one man
[52:56] one man one person in the hands of God
[52:59] you see why brother B says man what
[53:01] could happen with a little group like
[53:03] this my we could have every call kind of
[53:06] devil if one can chase 10,000 a 100,000
[53:10] ought to be running
[53:14] tonight if he can get you in his
[53:17] grip but that's the secret isn't it if
[53:20] he can get you in his grip if he can get
[53:23] let get you to let go of this and let go
[53:25] of that
[53:32] and Just Surrender yourself amen
[53:35] remember a little my little sermon the
[53:36] other day my mini sermon this is kind of
[53:40] this what we're speaking
[53:46] of
[53:50] Amen let him
[53:52] go let
[53:54] go how many know in this world and in
[53:57] this life and in this Christian walk

[54:06] go you got to let those who offend you
[54:09] and your past offensive you got to let

[59:28] message called what is that in your hand
[59:29] David that right what is that in your

[59:37] sling just a little sling it's all David

[59:45] barely sing a song or I can't barely do
[59:47] this that or the other whatever it is
[59:49] that God has given you go out there and
[59:52] use it let God get behind it and it'll
[59:54] become a lot a little as a a lot when
[59:56] God is in
[59:59] it that little sling meant a lot it
[1:00:01] become a whole Mighty it might as well
[1:00:04] up in an atomic bomb for that g it
[1:00:06] didn't matter what he had a great big
[1:00:07] long sword a matter what he
[1:00:10] had David didn't need one of these big
[1:00:12] machines that threw Fireballs no he just
[1:00:15] needed a little SL and God that's all he
[1:00:18] needed to be in the hands of God he can
[1:00:21] bring the giant down I'm here to tell
[1:00:23] you if you'll surrender yourself Amen to

[1:02:30] first you ought to be quicker to preach
[1:02:32] amen the
[1:02:35] preacher amen but that's all good isn't
[1:02:37] it that's what he said that's Prophet
[1:02:40] taught us you have to believe and have
[1:02:42] enough self-esteem to believe you're the
[1:02:44] one that's
[1:02:46] going amen I got a little more I might
[1:02:50] as well go ahead and go a little more
[1:02:51] this road would that be okay I'm I'm
[1:02:55] going to come down here here brother
[1:02:56] Glenn you come on my mind when I was
[1:02:58] studying
[1:02:59] this let me let me say something first
[1:03:02] of all one of the ways to release the
[1:03:05] power of God is your confession or
[1:03:08] profession how many knows he's the high
[1:03:10] priest of your profession brother Bram
[1:03:12] said that's the confession to confession
[1:03:14] is to say what he says now how many
[1:03:17] knows that before you confess something
[1:03:19] you have to let go of
[1:03:21] something brother Tommy if we have a
[1:03:23] diff differences and we had a bad
[1:03:25] falling out we had this that or the
[1:03:26] other amen and before we can never be
[1:03:28] friends again somebody's got to
[1:03:30] confess if we're mad at each other we
[1:03:32] ain't no it was Tommy no it was Tommy no
[1:03:34] it was Tommy huh ain't nothing going to
[1:03:38] be released under those conditions but
[1:03:41] when I say predat Tommy I believe man I
[1:03:43] should have done a little different than
[1:03:44] that I'm sorry it was my fault how many
[1:03:47] notice there's power that comes with
[1:03:49] that you're letting go of that you're
[1:03:51] admitting to the
[1:03:54] truth that's what we got to do to the
[1:03:56] word of God conf uh admit to God's word
[1:03:59] confess his word he says that by your
[1:04:01] his stripes you were healed amen the
[1:04:03] work was done on Calvary you better
[1:04:05] start talking his language make a
[1:04:07] confession and it'll release the power
[1:04:09] of God in your life but B says you'll
[1:04:12] never get nothing until you confess that
[1:04:14] he's already done
[1:04:16] it it's already done it's already done
[1:04:20] it's already
[1:04:24] done I'm already raptured it's already
[1:04:27] done before it's ever going to happen
[1:04:30] you're going to have to believe that it
[1:04:31] is butam says
[1:04:33] Abraham we're a type of Abraham and
[1:04:36] Sarah Abraham was turned back to a young
[1:04:40] man
[1:04:41] again if I'm not wrong brother bandam
[1:04:43] Illustrated it one morning Sarah said to
[1:04:47] Abraham
[1:04:48] Abraham your hair you don't have any
[1:04:51] gray hair anymore your gray hair is gone
[1:04:55] is that right
[1:04:56] so brother Glenn I was going to say do
[1:04:58] you see my hair is there less gray
[1:05:12] hair boy we messed up on that one
[1:05:15] brother Glenn why do we got to confess
[1:05:18] before we ever get
[1:05:19] [Laughter]
[1:05:23] it oh my confession right how about them
[1:05:28] wrinkles under my eyes are they a little
[1:05:30] better or
[1:05:32] worse but that's a little safer but what
[1:05:36] is it how many believe that if that's
[1:05:39] true that we're like Abraham and one of
[1:05:41] these days he's going to so before it
[1:05:43] happens even before we see it we're
[1:05:46] going to see it yeah I'm seeing it I see
[1:05:49] it by faith brother by faith you see
[1:05:52] amen my hair is getting blacker amen I'm
[1:05:54] getting stronger I'm going to turn right
[1:05:57] back into a 20-year old man like I was
[1:06:00] in 20s this guy's going to change me
[1:06:01] back how many believes that but before
[1:06:04] it happens you better start confessing I
[1:06:06] believe I'm going to be in that
[1:06:09] Rapture so look in the mirror brother
[1:06:13] Glenn yeah hey look in the mirror

[1:09:55] to I'll go on a 40-day fast so I can do
[1:09:57] something you don't need a 40-day fast
[1:10:00] what you need to do is let go of the
[1:10:01] world and all these devilish things and
[1:10:04] take God's word in your heart you got to
[1:10:07] be taught how to do it you don't do it
[1:10:09] by jumping up and down neither do you do
[1:10:11] it by 40-day fast you do it by a
[1:10:13] surrendered heart to almighty
[1:10:16] God glory how many believes it's about
[1:10:19] surrendering to almighty
[1:10:22] God so that he can use you
[1:10:26] like a little baby or a child I would
[1:10:28] have said when you're trying to dress
[1:10:30] them when they're real small you try to
[1:10:32] put that coat on is that right sister
[1:10:35] Serenity knows some of our sister knows
[1:10:38] when you're trying to put a something on
[1:10:40] that baby it'll just pull that arm back
[1:10:42] got to pull that thing back and try to
[1:10:43] get that thing on pull it back and put
[1:10:45] it on ain't that right young children
[1:10:48] sometimes before they really know how to
[1:10:49] dress you gotta just hold still hold
[1:10:52] still and let me do it Mom grabs the arm
[1:10:54] puts it in there

[1:11:07] he wants to get his arm but he just
[1:11:08] keeps beating all around and he never
[1:11:10] gets into sleeve amen that's the way we
[1:11:13] are about amen oh we want to see God do
[1:11:17] this we want to see that but sometimes
[1:11:19] we just we're fighting too much we're
[1:11:22] struggling too much we're trying too
[1:11:23] hard we're not just surrendering to God
[1:11:26] say God dress me God clothes me cuz when
[1:11:30] God does it boy it's going to be done so
[1:11:32] much
[1:11:34] better how many believe that try to put
[1:11:37] his arm in he's got to have someone to
[1:11:39] direct him how to put it arm in and when
[1:11:42] he gets his arm in his little jacket he
[1:11:45] knows it's all right amen people might
[1:11:49] struggle they might fight they might
[1:11:51] battle who was it buddy Robinson I guess
[1:11:54] it was or one of them I believe it was I

[1:12:03] and he always his mules would always act
[1:12:05] up and he beat him and everything else

[1:12:10] up and bit his ear didn't he pulled a
[1:12:13] Mike Tyson on
[1:12:16] him bite your ear off I can't beat you
[1:12:19] I'll bite

[1:12:24] and said God I'm in cornfield and if you
[1:12:26] don't if you don't give me the Holy
[1:12:27] Ghost had to battle out had to struggle
[1:12:30] it out and that right struggle but just
[1:12:33] learn to release to
[1:12:34] God Amen and finally when you get the
[1:12:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost oh my how

[1:12:58] born again when trials and troubles and
[1:13:01] heartaches and disappointments set in
[1:13:03] something
[1:13:04] holds amen not you holding something
[1:13:08] holding you see it isn't a question
[1:13:10] whether I held or not it's a question
[1:13:12] whether he held or not it isn't looking
[1:13:14] at me it's looking at him he's the one a
[1:13:17] man came not long ago said brother brand
[1:13:19] I'm not worthy to be
[1:13:22] saved I said no you're right you're not
[1:13:25] he just started weeping he said ' I've
[1:13:27] tried since 1940 to get
[1:13:31] saved he said but I can't find myself
[1:13:34] worthy
[1:13:36] huh folks will do this they'll go on 45
[1:13:39] day fast they'll try to do this they'll
[1:13:40] try to do that to get worthy no you'll
[1:13:43] never work yourself
[1:13:48] worthy you ain't got to crawl on your
[1:13:50] knees so far you ain't got to beat
[1:13:51] yourself on the back like a lot of them
[1:13:53] will still do today trying to find God
[1:13:56] thinking that by whooping themselves
[1:13:58] buddy you just whooped yourself in vain
[1:14:01] huh cuz he is already worthy it's
[1:14:04] already there he's the worthy
[1:14:08] one wo he says that's the way is with
[1:14:11] every born again Christian when he
[1:14:12] really gets in wait a minute wrong
[1:14:16] story all right you really he says
[1:14:18] you'll never be worthy he says then I
[1:14:20] can never be saved see if we could ever
[1:14:22] get the scare out of the people that's
[1:14:24] something oh don't know uh you're
[1:14:26] wanting a little uh touch
[1:14:29] me uh lay your hands on me Hocus Pocus
[1:14:33] he says God's word is your
[1:14:37] basis God's word is your basis how many
[1:14:41] believes if a sinner uh hotting uh out
[1:14:45] in Africa somewhere get a hold of a
[1:14:47] Bible amen he he would read John 3:16
[1:14:50] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:14:52] his only begotten said whosoever if that
[1:14:54] boy genuine I believe that's what God
[1:14:56] Said that boy can get saved that girl
[1:14:58] can get saved right there right
[1:15:02] then ain't got to pray long ain't got to
[1:15:04] do all that Just Surrender and just
[1:15:06] believe what God
[1:15:08] said because if you'll believe what God
[1:15:10] said you're ready suring your will your
[1:15:12] ideas on God's basis I like that that's
[1:15:15] part of our sermon tonight God said so
[1:15:18] just lay there out there perfect that's
[1:15:21] right that's where we believe it see
[1:15:23] it's not nothing or if I can do this or
[1:15:25] that or that this or that or the other
[1:15:27] it's not what you done it's what God has
[1:15:29] done for you oh my people say oh if I
[1:15:32] could just keep holding on now how many
[1:15:33] knows in life there's a time to hold on
[1:15:36] Amen and one of the hold on is your
[1:15:38] faith you hold on to faith Paul says I
[1:15:41] have finished I have finished a fight I
[1:15:44] have fought a good fight I have finished
[1:15:46] my course I have kept the faith that
[1:15:49] right we call it the fight of Faith the
[1:15:52] real fight the real battle is in that
[1:15:54] faith
[1:15:55] because if thou can't believe all things
[1:15:57] possible see the battle is in your
[1:15:59] unbelief and the between B uh unbelief
[1:16:01] and Faith now notice Keep Holding On It
[1:16:05] ain't you holding on it's whether he
[1:16:06] held on or not it ain't what I am it's
[1:16:09] what he is what he presented represented
[1:16:12] in me me he said God don't see me as I
[1:16:15] am if I'm in Christ he sees Christ he
[1:16:18] don't see me no more for I'm dead and my
[1:16:21] life is hid in Christ sealed by the Holy
[1:16:23] Ghost amen
[1:16:25] praise the Lord and he goes to S
[1:16:27] speaking and he explained it to the man
[1:16:29] he says oh I see he understood it's not
[1:16:34] about you trying to be worthy because
[1:16:36] you'll never be worthy it's about
[1:16:38] accepting what he has done already it's
[1:16:41] about what his word has said remember
[1:16:45] that common hiss of faith that I was
[1:16:47] talking about am me brother I call it
[1:16:49] John Ryan Faith because John Ryan he he
[1:16:52] he went out there confessing thank thank
[1:16:54] God for my healing thank God for my
[1:16:56] healing is't that right and he did it
[1:16:57] for a few days and it never happened and
[1:16:59] he got back into prayer line didn't he
[1:17:03] he says it didn't happen and so forth
[1:17:06] and and God says don't you believe me he
[1:17:09] say yes I believe me I believe you then
[1:17:11] why are you doubting go out there and
[1:17:12] confess he went out there amen and have
[1:17:15] no doubt but all he had is confession he
[1:17:17] confessed confessed believed and confess
[1:17:19] it and then of course his eyes come
[1:17:21] popped open I mean know that's the way
[1:17:23] we do take God's word into your heart
[1:17:26] and watch God make a revelation out of
[1:17:28] that make it quick to your life but
[1:17:30] you've got to take it on the inside here
[1:17:32] first and believe it with all of your
[1:17:34] heart amen just that common Faith amen
[1:17:40] and whenever God comes down and does
[1:17:42] something for you I mean knows after
[1:17:45] that then you're not more your own
[1:17:48] anymore it's not about
[1:17:51] you folks we like to brag about our
[1:17:54] faith the mountains we've moved and and
[1:17:56] and the people were healed and
[1:17:57] everything else under their prayer let
[1:17:59] me tell you something it's all belongs
[1:18:00] to Jesus
[1:18:01] Christ ain't a good thing about any of
[1:18:04] us except for the Christ that's on the
[1:18:06] inside of us how many of know amen
[1:18:08] listen to this so he says after he gets
[1:18:11] that jacket on you he says that's the
[1:18:13] way it is with every born again
[1:18:14] Christian amen when he really gets God
[1:18:17] into God he watches his life with God's
[1:18:20] word and he realizes he's lined up with
[1:18:22] every bit of it he's got long suffering
[1:18:24] and gentleness and quietness and
[1:18:26] meekness and Fa power and faith and love
[1:18:29] and joy and peace he ain't tossed about
[1:18:32] like a troubl se he ain't worried about
[1:18:34] every little
[1:18:37] thing W Glory how many's glad that amen

[1:18:45] of you you ain't got to worry about
[1:18:48] everything let me tell you something how
[1:18:50] many people this evening would like to
[1:18:52] stay looking young
[1:18:55] remember the lady brother B met in the
[1:18:57] little store amen and she was 60 years
[1:19:00] old and he he got to talking to her and
[1:19:03] said you look 30 she don't 30 that she
[1:19:06] says I learned amen that when I got born
[1:19:08] again I commit my case to God I let go
[1:19:11] of all my cases and I commited to God
[1:19:14] Amen if he can't take care of it ain't
[1:19:16] no worry about no sense in me worrying
[1:19:18] about
[1:19:19] it oh my when you live like that in the
[1:19:22] peace of God rules in your heart that no
[1:19:24] matter what
[1:19:25] comes you committed to God and said you
[1:19:28] oh God's going to deal with it how many
[1:19:30] believe you God fights your battles for
[1:19:33] you but where does he do it at in your
[1:19:36] heart in your life that's where he
[1:19:37] fights it
[1:19:40] that how many knows we are God's
[1:19:43] Victory we are God's
[1:19:49] Victory oh I'm not very much I'm all
[1:19:52] defeated no you're not you're Victorious

[1:20:12] Victorious everything belongs to you
[1:20:15] that every promise in the book is
[1:20:19] mine nothing's impossible with me
[1:20:22] nothing's impossible with you
[1:20:25] why that's what he
[1:20:28] said we say oh I can't do it I don't
[1:20:31] know if I got the
[1:20:33] faith that's what the devil tries to
[1:20:35] tell you that's what he uses your flesh
[1:20:37] to tell you isn't that what he told
[1:20:39] Moses Moses was telling himself oh I
[1:20:41] can't do it
[1:20:46] huh but he could it God didn't like his
[1:20:50] confession did
[1:20:51] he he saidwell who makes the mouth I'm
[1:20:54] the one that makes the mouth to speak
[1:20:58] amen praise be to God oh couldn't Moses

[1:21:15] let everybody
[1:21:19] go I don't know if I can do this huh
[1:21:23] every thought that you could possibly
[1:21:25] imagine might have went through his
[1:21:27] mind but it doesn't record it does it no
[1:21:30] because after the backside of the desert
[1:21:32] experience he mounted the donkey took
[1:21:34] his wife and his child amen and
[1:21:36] everybody passed by he says Hey I'm
[1:21:39] going down to Egypt to take over he had

[1:22:23] of that bride you're part part of that
[1:22:25] bride and you're going to be without
[1:22:27] spot you're going to be without wrinkle

[1:31:45] about a month or two I was going up the
[1:31:47] road I had my hands behind me my old
[1:31:49] pair of boots on I couldn't go home I
[1:31:51] couldn't go anywhere my heart was broke
[1:31:54] the state senator of Indiana Mr eer come
[1:31:56] to my church and I was going walking up

[1:36:03] word let go of everything else just
[1:36:06] believe God's word that's how you do it
[1:36:10] amen because he was dealing with a lot
[1:36:12] of Pentecostals who
[1:36:13] them Jump Around D speaking they they
[1:36:17] try to work up
[1:36:19] something that's why he said bad there
[1:36:23] I'm sweating
[1:36:24] but I'm not trying to work nothing up
[1:36:26] I'm not trying to let loose they would
[1:36:27] they do all of those things trying to
[1:36:28] let
[1:36:31] go let go a shelf and let the Holy
[1:36:34] Spirit Come perhaps and speak in time
[1:36:36] but that's not it he said you don't have
[1:36:38] to work up a sweat to let go all you got

[1:37:40] forgiveness and I believe you'll fill me
[1:37:42] again with the Holy Ghost there's be a
[1:37:44] time otherwise you'll stay there and the
