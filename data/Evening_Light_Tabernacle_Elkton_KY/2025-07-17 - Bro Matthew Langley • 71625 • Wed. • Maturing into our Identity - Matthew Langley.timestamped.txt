[12:12] master.
[12:15] Crossing the calm sea with Jesus,
[12:21] the disciples were getting concerned.
[12:27] The wind started violently blowing,
[12:33] but he was asleep in the stern.
[12:39] And does he not care that we perish?
[12:44] We're helpless and we're so afraid.
[12:51] Jesus arose when they called him
[12:56] and said to them, "Where is your faith?
[13:01] Because you prayed
[13:05] all night.
[13:08] Cuz you held on with all of your might.

[14:05] You're frightened and nowhere to run.
[14:10] And by now your vessel is filling
[14:16] and you're thinking that you'll surely
[14:20] drown.
[14:22] You cry out for help from the Savior.
[14:28] And you know you can't give up now
[14:33] because you prayed
[14:36] all night. Cuz you held on with all of
[14:42] your might.

[15:29] child, your cries
[15:32] have awoken.

[15:49] to rejoice.

[17:41] storm

[31:17] to the Lord this evening.
[31:21] My Jesus,
[31:24] my savior.
[31:27] Lord, there is none like you.
[31:32] All of my days
[31:36] I want to praise
[31:39] the wonders of your mighty
[31:45] love.
[31:49] My comfort,
[31:53] my shelter,
[31:55] tower of refuge and strength.
[32:00] Let every breath
[32:03] and all that I am
[32:07] never cease to worship
[32:12] you.
[32:16] Shout to the Lord all the earth. Let us
[32:20] sing.
[32:23] Power and majesty
[32:25] praise to the king.
[32:29] The mountains bow down and the seas will

[32:48] hands.
[32:50] [Music]
[32:54] I'll stand.
[32:57] Nothing compares to the proise I have in
[33:03] you.
[33:06] Let's sing that again.
[33:11] My Jesus,
[33:14] my Savior,
[33:17] Lord, there's none like you
[33:22] all of my days.
[33:26] I want to praise
[33:29] the wonders of your mighty
[33:34] love.
[33:38] My comfort,
[33:42] my shelter,
[33:44] power of reuge and strength.
[33:49] Let every breath
[33:53] all that I am

[34:01] you.

[34:11] Power and majesty,
[34:14] praise to the king.
[34:18] Mountains bow down and the seas will

[34:26] of your name.
[34:29] [Applause]
[34:31] I sing for joy at the works of your
[34:35] hands.
[34:37] Forever I love you. Forever I'll stand.
[34:45] Nothing compares to the promise I have
[34:50] in you.
[34:56] Let's just bow our heads.
[34:59] Jesus, we're coming before you so
[35:01] thankful, Lord, for everything you've
[35:03] done for us. Our finite minds, we can't
[35:06] even comprehend everything you've done,
[35:08] Lord. Just the reality that we live in,
[35:11] Lord. Even right now, the power of your
[35:14] word is holding us together. It's
[35:16] holding all this reality together.
[35:18] Everything that happens, Lord, is in the
[35:20] palm of your hand, Lord. The blessings,
[35:22] the things we enjoy, as well as the
[35:24] trials and the things we don't like so
[35:26] much. But Jesus, we just need to learn
[35:28] to trust you more and more and just
[35:30] place ourselves in rest in knowing that
[35:33] you've got it all in control and you've
[35:36] got our best in mind. Lord, I just ask
[35:38] that you'll speak to us this evening,
[35:40] Lord, and just draw us closer to you. In
[35:42] your name, amen. Amen.
[35:46] Y'all may be seated.
[35:50] Good evening. Y'all seen me up here
[35:51] before, but normally when I was singing
[35:54] and not so much this here. This is a new
[35:57] development started about a year and a
[35:59] half ago, I think. Something like that.
[36:02] Anyway, um God brought me kind of to a
[36:06] rock in a hard place, and he reminded
[36:08] me, he called me to preach back when I
[36:11] was in my teens and
[36:14] I don't like listening very well. So, I
[36:17] told him no. and it didn't work out too
[36:19] long in the long run. So, here I am.
[36:24] So, anyway, um if we can in our Bibles,
[36:27] turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 13 verses
[36:31] 9 through13.
[36:33] The title of uh this evening's um sermon
[36:36] is going to be maturing into our
[36:38] identity. And before I get into this, I
[36:41] just like to say I was going through
[36:44] some stuff last week and the Lord gave
[36:46] me this sermon and then brother brother
[36:48] Thomas preached Sunday and I was like,
[36:51] "Okay, well maybe we're on the same page
[36:52] here because uh that's definitely God
[36:54] working maturing into our identity." Um
[36:57] 1 Corinthians 13:9 through13. If we
[36:59] could all stand for the first reading of
[37:01] the word.
[37:06] For we know in part, and we prophesy in
[37:09] part.
[37:11] But when that which is perfect is come,
[37:14] then that which is in part shall be done
[37:16] away.
[37:17] When I was a child, I spake as a child.
[37:20] I understood as a child, I thought as a
[37:23] child. But when I became a man, I put
[37:27] away childish things.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; For now we see through a glass darkly,
[37:33] but then face to face.
[37:36] Now I know in part, but then shall I
[37:39] know even as also I am known.
[37:43] And now abideth faith, hope, and
[37:45] charity, these three. But the greatest
[37:48] of these is charity. You may be seated.
[37:53] So let's look back at this scripture
[37:55] again. This is Paul. This is the first
[37:59] church age messenger who is a prophet.
[38:03] And he's saying we, he's including
[38:06] himself. He said, "We know in part and
[38:11] we can only prophesy in part." There
[38:13] were things Paul didn't know. God would
[38:15] give Paul prophecies. Absolutely. In
[38:17] fact, Paul was called up into the
[38:19] heavens, but he didn't have the full
[38:21] prophecies of everything.
[38:23] We know that in the days of the voice of
[38:26] the seventh angel, that is when the
[38:28] fullness of everything came as far as
[38:30] the prophecies go. But Paul is saying we
[38:33] know in part, we prophesy in part, but
[38:35] that which is perfect is come. Now
[38:38] perfect is also often used in the New
[38:41] Testament to mean mature. When Jesus
[38:43] Christ said, "Be ye therefore perfect
[38:46] even in my as my father in heaven is
[38:47] perfect." He was not meaning never have
[38:50] a down day, never mess up. He was like,
[38:53] "No, be mature." Right?
[38:56] &gt;&gt; And so when that which is perfect is
[38:58] come, then that which is in part shall
[38:59] be done away with. And then he goes
[39:01] about how a kid doesn't understand
[39:03] things. They don't understand the big
[39:05] picture. And so it's like, "Daddy, why
[39:07] you doing this? Daddy, why you doing
[39:09] that?" And you try to explain, but a lot
[39:11] of stuff their brains just can't
[39:13] comprehend.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the thing with God.
[39:18] He started off with the Jews and they
[39:20] had a partial revelation. They didn't
[39:22] understand the full salvation story. And
[39:24] then he transitions over to the Gentiles
[39:26] when the Jews rejected
[39:28] and they get more revelation and they
[39:31] understand, oh, God doesn't just want to
[39:33] be a father figure above us. He wants to
[39:36] be our brother living with us. And then
[39:39] when the Holy Ghost comes in, they got
[39:41] the further revelation. Oh, he also
[39:43] wants to be our comforter and our
[39:45] teacher in us. And so it's progressive
[39:48] revelation, but still they were not
[39:50] seeing the full picture.
[39:52] The full picture is
[39:54] that God wants us to be like he is
[39:57] literally he wants us to be messiahes.
[40:00] He wants us to be in that position of
[40:02] power and authority. But we can't just
[40:04] get there. You can't stick your
[40:05] 5-year-old kid in your van.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Now, that kid is your kid, but that kid
[40:11] ain't matured.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; There's a way we have to mature. It's a
[40:16] specific pro process he's got for us to
[40:19] mature. And this is the way we have to
[40:21] mature. Now, we've all got well, those
[40:24] of us that have kids, we've got kids.
[40:26] And we've all been kids at some point in
[40:28] time.
[40:29] Some of us a longer time ago than
[40:31] others.
[40:34] But with that being said, when you're a
[40:36] kid and you see your parents doing
[40:38] something and you're like, I want to do
[40:39] it. And you try to do it. Now, your
[40:43] heart is sincere. You're trying to be
[40:45] like your parent, but what do you do?
[40:47] You absolutely mess it up. At one point,
[40:50] you can't even get yourself dressed,
[40:52] right? What's that kid say when it
[40:55] starts to mature enough to to want to
[40:56] grow into that? I want to do it. And
[40:58] they're trying to put their hands into
[40:59] it. They're trying to put their hands
[41:01] into the shirt sleeves and they just
[41:02] mess it up. They'll put their thing on
[41:04] upside down, inside out, and backwards.
[41:06] Right? And they get frustrated when the
[41:09] parent is like, "No, do it this way. Do
[41:12] it that way." And a lot of times, who's
[41:13] the kid get upset with? At their parent.
[41:17] because the parents not letting them
[41:19] free will uh just willy-nilly do
[41:21] whatever they want. They're trying to
[41:23] teach them something. A lot of times God
[41:26] lets us have trials to show us you ain't
[41:29] doing it right. You got some growth you
[41:31] need to do in this area, that area.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; New computer, y'all. And it's already
[41:40] acting up. So, we'll get through this.
[41:42] It's all right. So, it's interesting
[41:46] that this whole thing about maturing,
[41:49] about the adoption process, let's go
[41:51] ahead and call it what it is,
[41:54] is in the love chapter, 1 Corinthians
[41:56] 13. It's at the very end of it because
[41:59] charity is love. Maturing, right off the
[42:02] rip, let's establish maturing is
[42:04] connected with love. If you watch a kid
[42:07] grow up angry, is he going to develop
[42:10] that much maturity?
[42:13] It's going to be hard for that person to
[42:15] develop maturity. I work with rough
[42:17] folks. Most of y'all know my profession
[42:19] has always been around the prison
[42:20] system, law enforcement, everything. I
[42:23] know some 60 year olds and the first
[42:25] thing out of his this man's mouth if you
[42:28] tell him to do something is, "I'm a man.
[42:29] You can't tell me what to do." As he is
[42:32] consistently making one immature
[42:34] decision after another.
[42:37] If you don't have love
[42:39] &gt;&gt; and respect and healthy relationships,
[42:42] you're not gonna mature correctly.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Okay? There's a reason love is connected
[42:47] in at the end of the love chapter
[42:50] because love is so important for us to
[42:52] mature. Paul's talking in the love
[42:54] chapter about love does this, love does
[42:56] that, love does the other. And then at
[42:58] the end he's like and love will mature
[43:00] you
[43:02] &gt;&gt; because you know he says even now we see
[43:06] through a glass. A glass was like a
[43:08] looking glass. They just had um back
[43:11] then they did have glass but their
[43:13] technology wasn't what is today. But a
[43:16] mirror you're looking is like you kind
[43:18] of see through it but you it's foggy,
[43:20] right? Well
[43:23] now we see through a glass darkly but
[43:25] then face to face. Now I know in part,
[43:27] but then shall I know even as also I am
[43:30] known. So there's going to come a point
[43:33] in time in our maturity when the way
[43:35] Jesus Christ knows us is the way we'll
[43:38] know ourselves.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; We have a tendency to look at ourselves
[43:42] through our carnal lenses and say, "Ah,
[43:45] yeah, okay, I've got this and I've got
[43:47] that and he's got this and that and
[43:49] she's got this and that." No. Jesus
[43:52] Christ looks at things clearly. And as
[43:54] long as we're looking at things through
[43:56] our lens,
[43:59] &gt;&gt; we're going to have a hard time
[44:00] maturing.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Let's go back. Let's go to 1 John 3 1-2.
[44:07] Behold, what manner of love the Father
[44:11] has bestowed on us that we should be
[44:14] called the sons of God. Therefore, the
[44:17] world knows us not because it knew him
[44:19] not. Beloved, now are we the sons of
[44:22] God, and it doth not yet appear what we
[44:26] shall be. So Paul's saying, we're the
[44:30] sons of God now, but we're still
[44:32] maturing. We don't know yet what we're
[44:35] actually going to be looking like
[44:37] because Paul was back then. We don't
[44:39] know yet what we're going to be looking
[44:40] like. But we know that when he shall
[44:43] appear, when Christ shall appear, we'll
[44:45] be like him.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; For we'll see him as he is. Now, hold
[44:50] on. In First Corinthians, he's like,
[44:53] he'll see us and I'll know and I'll know
[44:56] as I am known.
[44:58] In first John, he's like, we'll see him
[45:00] as he is. So Jesus Christ already knows
[45:03] us the way we should be known. When we
[45:07] mature, we'll actually be seeing him the
[45:09] way he truly is. and we'll know, oh my
[45:12] goodness, I'm just like he is because
[45:15] we'll be like him.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; We c we we sell ourselves too short when
[45:21] we're going through our lives and we
[45:24] just tend to think, man, how am I going
[45:26] to get through this? And this sermon
[45:28] comes like this sermon came to me like
[45:30] most of my sermons come to me when I'm
[45:32] having a bad day
[45:35] and I'm having a bad day and I'm getting
[45:37] down and depressed and I'm getting in a
[45:40] bad attitude and Jesus is like what are
[45:42] you doing down there? You know my word.
[45:45] Why don't you learn something? And then
[45:46] I'm like oh. And he's like now because
[45:49] you're having this issue why don't you
[45:51] preach on it until you figure this out.
[45:53] So I was like all right. So
[45:57] Jesus is sweet like that. Anyway,
[46:00] so let's again realize love is again
[46:05] connected with maturing. But what is the
[46:08] ultimate capping of the stature of a
[46:09] perfect man? It starts with faith and it
[46:12] ends in love.
[46:15] Without love, we won't mature
[46:16] appropriately. I'm saying this again.
[46:19] The capstone, our Lord Jesus Christ
[46:22] comes down crying, "Grace! grace. So now
[46:26] we're seeing that love is connected with
[46:28] grace and it's all connected with
[46:30] maturing appropriately.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[46:35] As we mature, we'll become increasingly
[46:37] aware what we shall aware of what we
[46:39] shall be and that when he appears we'll
[46:42] be like him. When we mature we'll be
[46:44] like him. That is our identity. So don't
[46:47] sell yourself short that you're just a
[46:49] dirty little nasty sinner. That'll never
[46:51] be anything more than that.
[46:55] Now, maturing into our identity, that's
[46:58] the focus, and it's all connected. Let's
[47:00] look at Romans chapter 8 14-23.
[47:05] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[47:08] God, they are the sons of God. Let me
[47:10] interrupt us to say, I know this is
[47:11] Wednesday night. I'm going to try to
[47:12] make this short,
[47:14] but I don't always have good luck doing
[47:17] that. So, I'm going to do my best. So,
[47:20] as many as are led by the spirit of God,
[47:22] they are the sons of God. For ye have
[47:25] not received the spirit of a bondage
[47:27] again to fear, but you've received the
[47:28] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
[47:31] "Aba, Father." Now, Brother Brandham
[47:33] preached adoption, and he preached that
[47:35] adoption when it's used in the Bible is
[47:37] not like adoption is today. Adoption
[47:41] today is is you ain't my kid, but I'll
[47:43] like you, so I'm going to do some
[47:44] paperwork to bring you in, and I'm going
[47:46] to treat you like you're my kid.
[47:48] Biblical adoption was I have a kid and I
[47:52] want that kid to take over my business
[47:55] because who here as a parent wants your
[47:57] kids to always stay two years old?
[48:01] If your kids Okay. So, some mamas do.
[48:05] All right. But if your kids stay two
[48:08] years old, about that time that kid hit
[48:11] three or four, you're taking him to the
[48:13] doctor saying, "What's wrong with my
[48:16] kid?" Right?
[48:18] We should be maturing as much as that
[48:21] perfect little stage. But uh and so we
[48:25] need to mature. And so biblical adoption
[48:28] is the dad is saying my kid should
[48:31] mature to the point that at one time
[48:35] he's eventually going to reach the
[48:36] maturity. I can say you know what my
[48:39] power and authority I give to you.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; I give it to you. You're mature. You was
[48:45] always my kid.
[48:47] But you've reached the maturity that
[48:50] this is what's happened. Now, that's the
[48:51] point of the Holy Ghost is to work with
[48:54] us and train us and tutor us and comfort
[48:57] us as we go through life and as we grow.
[48:59] But we need the correct perspective to
[49:02] do this.
[49:04] So, we have not received the spirit of
[49:07] bondage again to fear, but you receive
[49:09] the spirit of adoption whereby we cry
[49:11] aba father. The spirit itself bears
[49:13] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[49:15] are the children of God. And if children
[49:18] then heirs that means you inherit
[49:21] something heirs of God and joint hes
[49:25] with Christ. So hold on. So you inherit
[49:28] everything Jesus Christ inherits.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; All right. But there's a caveat. If so
[49:35] be that we suffer with him that we may
[49:38] be also glorified together. Now, we like
[49:42] looking at Jesus and we like looking at
[49:43] the mount transfiguration and wow, he
[49:46] glowed and everybody was impressed. And
[49:48] then after he rose from the dead, he
[49:49] went up to heaven and now he's sitting
[49:51] at the right hand of the father and
[49:53] we're like, "Yay, that's my Jesus."
[49:56] That same glory is for every one of us
[49:58] in here in this room. If you can accept
[50:01] it and if you can walk into it and
[50:03] mature into it, we are joint hes with
[50:07] Jesus Christ. If so be that we suffer
[50:09] with him that we may be also glorified
[50:12] together. Why do we need to suffer with
[50:15] Christ?
[50:17] Because the Bible said that Jesus Christ
[50:19] was perfected through his obedience and
[50:23] suffering.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; We have to do the same thing Jesus did.
[50:27] How you mature is by obeying even when
[50:31] that obedience leads you through
[50:33] suffering.
[50:34] In the military, you go to basic
[50:37] training, and those of y'all that have
[50:38] been know this. They don't say, "Come on
[50:41] in.
[50:43] We want to put you in the best
[50:46] healthiest frame of mind so that you can
[50:49] defend our country. So, here's some nice
[50:51] food. Here's a comfortable bed. We're
[50:54] just You get You get full body massages
[50:57] every day. You get to sleep in as much
[51:00] as you want. You get to eat as much as
[51:01] you want. Everybody gets a personal
[51:03] trainer and there's always someone
[51:05] sitting nearby. If you start feeling
[51:07] bad, they'll pat you on the back to make
[51:09] you feel better.
[51:11] That don't happen. Why? Because you
[51:14] won't mature that way. You can't be
[51:17] trusted to handle a combat uh condition
[51:21] if you haven't been through tough times.
[51:25] And so they create this wonderful loving
[51:27] environment called basic training in
[51:30] which they treat you pretty poorly. You
[51:33] don't enjoy the majority of it. But if
[51:36] you just obey through your suffering,
[51:39] you get through it. And usually those
[51:41] individuals that have gone through basic
[51:42] training can look back and see a
[51:44] distinct difference in how they behaved
[51:47] before basic training and how they
[51:49] behave afterwards. It makes you grow up
[51:51] a little bit.
[51:53] So that's why we need to suffer along
[51:57] with Christ so we can be glorified
[52:00] together. For I reckon that the
[52:03] sufferings of this present time are not
[52:05] worthy to be compared with the glory
[52:08] which shall be revealed in us. In a
[52:11] different place he's like mind is not
[52:13] seen, ears not heard, not even entered
[52:16] into the thought of man. What's waiting
[52:18] on us? So it's one second in glory and
[52:22] you don't even care about however much
[52:25] misery you went through in this life
[52:28] for the earnest expectation of the
[52:30] creature. What is the creature? The
[52:32] creature that Greek word it was
[52:34] translated into creature. It means the
[52:36] creation what God has created. For the
[52:38] earnest expectation of the creature
[52:41] waitth for the manifestation of the sons
[52:44] of God. Why does the creation wait on us
[52:46] to manifest the sons of God? Jesus
[52:49] Christ has already come and lived a
[52:51] perfect life and died and rose again.
[52:55] Why is the creation still waiting on us?
[52:58] Why does the creation care about whether
[53:00] we manifest our calling?
[53:05] For the creature was made subject to
[53:06] vanity, not willingly. It wasn't animals
[53:10] and nature that sinned, but by reason of
[53:13] him who hath subjected the same in hope.
[53:16] because the creature itself also shall
[53:19] be delivered from the bondage of
[53:20] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[53:23] the children of God. For we know that
[53:26] the whole creation groanth and travaleth
[53:29] in pain together until now. And not only
[53:31] they, but ourselves also, which have the
[53:34] first fruits of the spirit. So Paul's
[53:36] saying, if you've got the Holy Ghost,
[53:37] you've got the first fruits of the
[53:38] spirit. Even we ourselves grown within
[53:40] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[53:44] the redemption of our body. The full
[53:47] redemption of our body is our body
[53:49] change.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; The epitome, the full culmination of
[53:53] adoption is when our bodies change. Why
[53:56] does creation wait on us?
[53:59] Because when God created man, what did
[54:02] he create man as? The gods of this
[54:05] dimension. And so when the gods of this
[54:08] dimension stepped under Satan's control,
[54:11] it broke that perfection
[54:14] and nature itself is stuck in this
[54:17] carnal condition until we get our body
[54:20] changed.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; It's stuck there. It's completely cursed
[54:25] until we get our body changed. Jesus
[54:28] Christ has done it. He did it so that we
[54:30] could do it. Yes.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; If Jesus Christ doing it was enough,
[54:36] then this nature would already be
[54:37] perfect and we'd be great. But no, it's
[54:39] up to us. So Jesus Christ had to mature
[54:42] into his ministry so he could die on the
[54:45] cross for us. We need to mature into our
[54:48] ministry so that we can achieve
[54:50] adoption, have our body changed, and
[54:52] then everything can be me remade brand
[54:55] new again.
[54:58] So maturity is connected with going
[55:00] through suffering and also connected
[55:02] with complete adoption which is our body
[55:03] change the rapture. We see that the
[55:05] rapture happens when we reach full
[55:07] maturity. Now I talked about being a
[55:10] soldier a little bit before. Let's do
[55:12] this again. 2 Timothy 2:3. Thou there
[55:16] therefore endure hardness as a good
[55:18] soldier of Jesus Christ. So Paul's
[55:20] telling Timothy that to be an ideal,
[55:22] proper or valuable soldier of Jesus
[55:24] Christ, he must be able to endure
[55:26] hardness and suffering. That's connected
[55:28] with we've got to suffer along with
[55:30] Christ. Hebrews 12:7, if you endure
[55:33] chastening, God dealeth with you as with
[55:35] sons. For what son is he whom the father
[55:38] chastineth not? So Paul is again con
[55:41] connecting maturity and adoption with
[55:43] enduring chastening. Chastening means
[55:45] instruction or training, even if it's
[55:47] sometimes uncomfortable.
[55:49] Chasing. Chasening is not pleasant, but
[55:52] it shows us where our weaknesses are.
[55:54] Instead of saying, "God, why aren't you
[55:56] letting me be comfortable or giving me
[55:57] what I want," we should be saying, "God,
[56:00] what are you trying to teach me?"
[56:02] Wasting time and energy complaining just
[56:04] stretches out the training.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; If you're going to grade school and you
[56:10] don't learn what you should have in
[56:11] fourth grade, guess what you going to be
[56:13] doing next year?
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Fourth grade again. Well, at least when
[56:18] they ran school systems, right? I heard
[56:19] they just keep bumping people along now.
[56:21] But hey,
[56:24] James 5:11, "Behold, we count them happy
[56:29] which endure. You have heard of the
[56:31] patience of Job and have seen the end of
[56:33] the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful
[56:36] and tender merc and of tender mercy.
[56:38] Enduring suffering is again connected
[56:40] with maturing and blessings.
[56:45] However, think about it. How should we
[56:48] endure suffering so that we mature
[56:50] correctly? We all know many people
[56:52] who've suffered plenty in life and they
[56:54] just become increasingly bitter and
[56:56] angry. They don't mature and they
[56:59] definitely aren't becoming more rapture
[57:00] ready.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Look at yourself.
[57:05] Have our trials gotten us closer to
[57:07] being rapture ready or have we ourselves
[57:10] become hardened and tired of our trials?
[57:14] Do we become discouraged and bitter? If
[57:17] we don't have the correct perspective of
[57:19] our trials, we'll be just like everybody
[57:21] else with their trials. We might get
[57:24] bitter, angry, more set in our carnal
[57:26] ways and our pessimistic attitudes. And
[57:29] that's not rapture ready. That's just
[57:31] being an angry carnal animal.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so what is how do we mature
[57:37] into this rapture condition?
[57:40] Well,
[57:43] praise the Lord. Here comes another one.
[57:45] The Lord just must, you know, the Lord
[57:47] knows best, right?
[57:50] Or do we look at it a different way? But
[57:53] what is the correct perspective?
[57:57] I really love Revelations 12 10-11.
[58:00] When God revealed this to me, it changed
[58:02] my life.
[58:04] forever.
[58:05] And I heard a loud voice saying in
[58:07] heaven, "Now has come salvation and
[58:09] strength in the kingdom of our God and
[58:10] the power of his Christ. For the accuser
[58:13] of our accuser of our brethren, which we
[58:15] know is the devil, is cast down, which
[58:17] accused them before our God day and
[58:19] night." Verse 11,
[58:22] "And they overcame him by the blood of
[58:25] the lamb and by the word of their
[58:27] testimony, and they loved not their
[58:29] lives until the death." We're to
[58:32] overcome by the blood of the lamb and by
[58:34] the word of our testimony. When we live
[58:37] our lives and face our trials, we're to
[58:39] overcome our trials and sufferings by
[58:40] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[58:42] our testimonies. But wait,
[58:45] billions of denominational Christians go
[58:48] through trials and claim the blood of
[58:49] the the blood of the lamb. And they also
[58:52] testify of their deliverances,
[58:53] blessings, and healings. And we know
[58:56] they're not necessarily getting rapture
[58:58] ready. So what's the difference?
[59:01] It's all about your revelation of what
[59:03] you're doing.
[59:05] You cannot live higher than your
[59:06] revelation. So I might be saying the
[59:09] exact same phrase that somebody else is
[59:12] saying and might be meaning something
[59:15] completely different. That's how come
[59:17] there's one Bible and how many
[59:19] denominations, right? And everybody's
[59:21] claiming to follow the word. I'm
[59:23] thankful for Malachi 4 who showed us the
[59:25] correct perspective on things.
[59:30] Modern events are made clear by
[59:32] prophecy. 1965.
[59:35] And you can be ever so s ever ever so
[59:37] sincere, but until we know what we're
[59:39] doing, you're fighting at the air. Come
[59:42] back into the word and get lined up and
[59:44] then go.
[59:46] And brother Brandham's talking about you
[59:48] have to understand the orders you've
[59:50] been given.
[59:51] If you have incorrect views regarding
[59:53] what your life should be looking like,
[59:54] you'll be wasting your energy beating
[59:56] the air, and you'll always be
[59:58] disappointed in your spiritual walk. Get
[1:00:00] lined up with God's will for your life,
[1:00:03] and you'll actually be going somewhere.
[1:00:06] 2 Corinthians 9:25- 26. And every man
[1:00:09] that striveth for the mastery is
[1:00:10] temperate in all things. Now, they do it
[1:00:13] to obtain a corruptible crown, but we
[1:00:15] incorruptible. And then he says,"I
[1:00:17] therefore so run, not as uncertainly, so
[1:00:20] fight I, not as one that beatth the
[1:00:23] air." So Paul is saying also, this isn't
[1:00:25] brother Brandham saying it. Paul is also
[1:00:28] saying, look, you've got to know what
[1:00:30] you're doing. Just because you have the
[1:00:31] word, you need the full revelation of
[1:00:33] what that word means to use it
[1:00:36] correctly.
[1:00:39] Now, let's look at Acts 2:38. I'm headed
[1:00:41] somewhere with this. Then Peter said
[1:00:43] unto them,"Repent and be baptized, every
[1:00:45] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:47] for the remission of sins, and you shall
[1:00:50] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[1:00:53] Now, here's the thing. We tend to re we
[1:00:56] tend to view repentance as being sorry
[1:00:58] for our sins and claiming by faith that
[1:01:01] Jesus Christ forgives us for our sins.
[1:01:04] That's good. Our view is that when we by
[1:01:06] faith claim claim Christ shed blood,
[1:01:09] Jesus Christ washes us in his blood and
[1:01:12] decides to forgive us for all the sins
[1:01:14] we've committed. We then view ourselves
[1:01:16] as having repented of our sins and been
[1:01:18] forgiven by God for the wrongs we've
[1:01:20] committed. We still view ourselves as
[1:01:23] being sinners but just repented sorry
[1:01:25] and forgiven sinners. our identity, the
[1:01:28] way we look at ourselves
[1:01:31] is we're still looking at ourselves as a
[1:01:33] sinner.
[1:01:35] [Music]
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; If you look at yourself as a sinner,
[1:01:38] guess what? You're always going to act
[1:01:40] like
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; a sinner.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; And you know you've got the revelation,
[1:01:45] you've got enough revelation that Jesus
[1:01:47] Christ died and willing to forgive you.
[1:01:49] So you just keep running back to him.
[1:01:50] Jesus, I did it again. Please forgive
[1:01:52] me. And of course he does because he
[1:01:55] loves us. But as long as your view is
[1:01:58] that you are a sinner, you will always
[1:02:01] behave as a sinner. Now I just want to
[1:02:04] clarify something. I am not preaching
[1:02:06] that there will come a point in time
[1:02:08] before our body change that we will be
[1:02:11] like spotless perfect like can't touch
[1:02:14] nothing about you. Right?
[1:02:16] But it has to be our faith in the road
[1:02:18] we're on. We have to be walking that
[1:02:20] direction when we get our body changed.
[1:02:22] Yeah, we will not make a mistake.
[1:02:25] But we have to be on that road headed
[1:02:28] that direction. If we always look at
[1:02:29] ourselves as us down here and Jesus
[1:02:32] Christ always up there and every time
[1:02:34] we're always messing up and reaching
[1:02:35] out. No, we have to look at ourselves as
[1:02:37] walking on that road up there to him.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; The only way to do that is to stop
[1:02:42] looking at yourself as a broken, nasty
[1:02:44] sinner.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Let's see. Let's see how this um we need
[1:02:52] more. We need a more complete revelation
[1:02:55] of Christ's blood than this.
[1:02:58] So, let's look at justification,
[1:03:00] repentance, and forgiveness.
[1:03:05] First off, let's look at standing in the
[1:03:07] gap. Brother Brandham said, "Today, he's
[1:03:10] the only mediator between God and man,
[1:03:11] and we're freely pardoned and forgiven.
[1:03:14] God don't even know we ever sinned." I'm
[1:03:16] jumping down and he's like, "We can
[1:03:18] still remember our sins because we're
[1:03:20] not big enough." But he's so great that
[1:03:22] he even forgets we ever did sin. We are
[1:03:25] sons and daughters in his presence. And
[1:03:28] all things that he was,
[1:03:31] we are.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't say we will be.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; He said we are. Right now.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; You have to live your life actually
[1:03:40] knowing that that's what you are. Right.
[1:03:44] We're going to get to why we have an
[1:03:45] issue. We're going to get to that. But
[1:03:47] first, I just want to hone in. This
[1:03:49] isn't just a standalone quote. This is
[1:03:51] in the Bible, too. But we've grown up
[1:03:54] looking at the Bible slightly
[1:03:55] differently from a denominational
[1:03:57] standpoint. Like, yeah, you're just a
[1:03:59] sinner. You ask for forgiveness. The
[1:04:02] Bible backs us up, too.
[1:04:05] Justification. Let's look at the word
[1:04:07] justification. What it means in the
[1:04:09] Bible. Romans 5:1. Therefore, being
[1:04:12] justified by faith, we have peace with
[1:04:14] God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:04:18] Justified means to show or regard as
[1:04:22] just or innocent.
[1:04:25] Innocent,
[1:04:27] it doesn't mean, well, you're guilty,
[1:04:29] but we pardoned you. It means you didn't
[1:04:32] do it.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; This is in the Bible. This is the what
[1:04:36] the Bible says, right? The old way of
[1:04:39] looking at things like I'm justified
[1:04:42] like I was all broken and now God's
[1:04:44] pulled me over here. That's wrong. Now,
[1:04:46] if you've got the faith, if that's all
[1:04:48] the faith you've got that God will
[1:04:50] forgive you, then that's fine. Jesus
[1:04:53] Christ saved people all through the dark
[1:04:54] ages, all through all all of church
[1:04:56] history with just that belief, right?
[1:04:59] But this is the full belief. You have to
[1:05:02] realize it wasn't you.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Let's look at repentance.
[1:05:08] Matthew 4:17, "From that time Jesus
[1:05:10] began to preach and say,"Repent, for the
[1:05:13] kingdom of heaven is at hand." And of
[1:05:15] course, Acts 2:38 says, "Then Peter said
[1:05:17] unto them, repent and be baptized, every
[1:05:19] one of you." Repent means to think
[1:05:23] differently.
[1:05:26] That's what repent means.
[1:05:28] It means you're doing your thing with a
[1:05:31] certain perspective and something comes
[1:05:33] along and you're like, "Oh, I was
[1:05:35] looking at it wrong.
[1:05:38] What should you repent of? When Jesus
[1:05:40] Christ was coming, he's like, "Repent
[1:05:42] for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[1:05:44] When Jesus was on earth, they were
[1:05:46] looking for a Messiah
[1:05:48] that was going to be a warrior. He was
[1:05:51] going to be a military leader. He was
[1:05:53] going to be a politician. And he's going
[1:05:54] to conquer the Romans and spread out.
[1:05:57] And Jesus Christ said, "Uh-uh, change
[1:05:59] what you're thinking. The kingdom of
[1:06:01] heaven's here, and I'm going to show you
[1:06:02] what it is. I'm going to heal the sick
[1:06:04] and raise the dead." And they didn't
[1:06:06] like that. They wanted him to kill
[1:06:07] people, but instead he was healing
[1:06:09] people. And that was their issue. They
[1:06:11] didn't want to repent. They didn't want
[1:06:13] to think differently. They wanted a
[1:06:15] Messiah the way they wanted a Messiah.
[1:06:18] And then Peter comes and they're like,
[1:06:20] "How do we be saved?" And he's like,
[1:06:22] "You got to repent. The first thing you
[1:06:24] have to do is quit thinking the way
[1:06:25] you're already thinking and you need to
[1:06:27] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:06:29] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:06:32] of your sins to get the Holy Ghost." So
[1:06:34] repent means to think differently.
[1:06:37] Now let's look at forgiveness.
[1:06:41] Forgiveness absolutely means you've done
[1:06:42] something wrong. Correct? We have to
[1:06:45] understand that the people that
[1:06:47] interpreted the Bible into English took
[1:06:49] the original Greek or Hebrew words and
[1:06:52] then put them into something that they
[1:06:54] understood.
[1:06:56] But they did this after being after over
[1:06:59] a thousand years of Catholic dogma and
[1:07:02] ideology.
[1:07:04] So these are ex- Catholics
[1:07:07] like after a thousand years of
[1:07:09] Catholicism, they've broken away and
[1:07:11] become Protestants, but they still have
[1:07:13] all this Catholic denominational dogma
[1:07:16] on the way things are. And so when
[1:07:18] they're translating these words over,
[1:07:19] they're using what they think it means,
[1:07:21] right? And it's pretty close to it, but
[1:07:24] it's not how we use the word
[1:07:26] forgiveness.
[1:07:27] The Greek word means freedom from sins.
[1:07:32] It doesn't mean
[1:07:35] you did it. It doesn't mean freedom from
[1:07:38] the effects of sins. It just means
[1:07:40] straight up freedom from sins.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Like if you accept what Christ's blood
[1:07:45] does, the the sin itself, you're not
[1:07:48] even connected with it.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; So that's what this is. This is what the
[1:07:53] word is. So justification means to show
[1:07:56] or regard as innocent. Repentance means
[1:07:59] to think differently. And forgiveness is
[1:08:00] freedom from sins. So justification is
[1:08:03] just the first step of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:05] moving in a person's life. Now at the
[1:08:08] very end of brother Brandham's ministry
[1:08:10] at the very end of 1965, he suddenly
[1:08:12] starts preaching more and more
[1:08:14] frequently on justification.
[1:08:16] And he's actually saying it
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; on actually a little bit more extreme
[1:08:21] than what he had been before
[1:08:25] in the visible invisible union of the
[1:08:27] bride of Christ. I just took just a
[1:08:29] couple of different examples.
[1:08:31] Um he says, "Now your name is now in the
[1:08:34] new book, not in the book of life, but
[1:08:36] in the lamb's book of life." Now the old
[1:08:38] book of your natural union, but your new
[1:08:41] bride, your new life is in the lamb's
[1:08:44] book of life. And he mentions Romans
[1:08:45] 5:1. Therefore, being justified by
[1:08:47] faith. And then he then he says the word
[1:08:50] don't mean forgiven. It means justified.
[1:08:53] It don't mean you're forgiven. And then
[1:08:55] he says this, for instance, you heard I
[1:08:58] got drunk and done some evil things and
[1:09:01] everything. Then you come around and say
[1:09:03] to me, you found out I didn't do them.
[1:09:05] Then you come around and say, "Brother
[1:09:07] Brandom, I forgive you. Forgive me. I
[1:09:11] didn't do it in the first place.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Now, if I did do it, I'm guilty
[1:09:19] and you could forgive me and I wouldn't
[1:09:20] be guilty. But yet I'm not justified
[1:09:23] because I actually did it.
[1:09:26] But the word justified is though you
[1:09:28] never did it. Remember justified is
[1:09:30] innocent.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Okay? You were accused. You never did it
[1:09:35] in the first place. The old union is in
[1:09:38] the sea of God's forgetfulness. And
[1:09:40] you're thinking, "Wait a minute. I know
[1:09:43] I sinned. I remember what I did, when I
[1:09:46] did it, who I did it to, and how it
[1:09:48] affected them."
[1:09:49] Brother Brandham says, "How did you come
[1:09:51] to do this? You were deceived into it by
[1:09:55] your first marriage to your adulterous
[1:09:57] parent, Eve. It's no fault of your own."
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; That's how come it ain't on you.
[1:10:07] Who here?
[1:10:09] Who here said, "Hey,
[1:10:12] I want me some carnal parents and I want
[1:10:15] to be born in sin and shaped in iniquity
[1:10:16] and boy, I'm going to tear it up."
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; None of us did.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; What Adam and Eve did in the beginning,
[1:10:25] puts us all in this condition. We didn't
[1:10:28] want this in the first place. Who would
[1:10:30] want this carnal life? And here's the
[1:10:33] thing. Jesus Christ came and died so
[1:10:36] that we can be free of all that.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; But the thing is is your life reflects
[1:10:42] your belief,
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; your faith. And if you're believing in
[1:10:46] God's word, that will manifest. But if
[1:10:48] you're believing in something that's not
[1:10:50] God's word, that will also manifest.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; And when you're born, you're born in
[1:10:55] sin, in a condition of sin, shaped in
[1:10:57] iniquity, and you grow up, number one,
[1:11:00] you've got death in your members. You've
[1:11:02] got the carnal nature on your back.
[1:11:04] You've got parents and you're trying to
[1:11:06] learn this and you're trying to learn
[1:11:07] that. You're going to develop carnal,
[1:11:10] negative, damaging beliefs.
[1:11:13] And that is what's going to manifest in
[1:11:15] your life as you live. And so when
[1:11:17] somebody tells you about Jesus, you're
[1:11:19] going to be like, "Okay, yeah, I mean,
[1:11:21] I'm so glad he's willing to overlook my
[1:11:23] issues." No. Again, if that's all the
[1:11:27] faith you have, he'll honor that. But to
[1:11:30] reach maturity, to go in this body
[1:11:32] change, we need to completely understand
[1:11:35] it ain't on us to begin with.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; It's all about our identity. And if you
[1:11:41] identify as a messed up sinner that
[1:11:44] Jesus just pulls you out, that's all
[1:11:46] you'll ever manifest. You have to
[1:11:48] completely get the revelation and start
[1:11:50] looking at yourself as a born again
[1:11:52] child of God who never did it in the
[1:11:55] first place.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:11:59] So that's the reason you were born as an
[1:12:02] adulteress. You're a sinner to begin
[1:12:04] with. That's right. You were deceived
[1:12:05] into it. Now it ain't your fault. You
[1:12:08] never did it because that little germ
[1:12:10] that was in you was to be you before the
[1:12:12] foundation of the world. God put your
[1:12:14] name in the lamb's book of life. Now
[1:12:16] I've got a question for you. Who are
[1:12:18] you? Are you a son of God or are you
[1:12:20] just a carnal animal?
[1:12:24] Can God or any of his children mess up?
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; God is infinite deity. God don't produce
[1:12:32] anything less than infinite deity. If I
[1:12:35] planted if I had an oak tree and I see a
[1:12:37] seed laying on the ground underneath
[1:12:39] that oak tree and say, "I must come from
[1:12:41] that oak tree. I'm going to go plant
[1:12:42] this." And that thing grew up to be a
[1:12:44] bush.
[1:12:46] I would say that seed was no oak tree
[1:12:49] because a oak tree only reproduces oaks.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, God, a deity will only
[1:12:58] reproduce deity. It doesn't reproduce
[1:13:02] broken, fallen down, messed up sinners.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; And so, you have to hang on to that.
[1:13:08] Now, we're talking about maturing and
[1:13:10] we're talking about you have to mature
[1:13:12] through fighting. there's something you
[1:13:15] have to fight and that's your carnal
[1:13:16] ideas about what's actually going on.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; And so he goes on and he talks about the
[1:13:24] bridegroom took away your shame and put
[1:13:26] it in the sea of forgetfulness. And he
[1:13:28] keeps talking about it and then he drops
[1:13:30] down and says this is my message to the
[1:13:33] church. Now
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham thought this was pretty
[1:13:36] important to hit on
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; and he hammered it and he kept hammering
[1:13:41] it for a few more paragraphs. A little
[1:13:43] bit later in December of 65 in
[1:13:46] communion,
[1:13:47] he said, "But yet all at once I looked
[1:13:50] up and I said, I'm not the son of
[1:13:53] Charles and Ella Brandom.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; There's something calling." And he's
[1:13:57] talking about the eagle and the chicken.
[1:14:00] And that eagle had to realize all of a
[1:14:01] sudden, I'm not a chicken. He had to
[1:14:04] realize he's an eagle before he could
[1:14:06] fly.
[1:14:08] Now, when he realized he was an eagle,
[1:14:10] he was still in the chicken yard acting
[1:14:12] like a chicken.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; But he didn't say,
[1:14:17] "Well,
[1:14:19] I mean, I see my lifestyle and
[1:14:21] everything I've done is like a chicken."
[1:14:23] Something on the inside says I'm an
[1:14:25] eagle, but I guess I'll just stay here
[1:14:27] as a chicken. He had never flown and
[1:14:29] he'd have died as a eagle acting like a
[1:14:32] chicken. Just like so many Christians
[1:14:34] live their life beat down by the trials
[1:14:36] and everything to come and they die.
[1:14:38] Well, God bless them. They're gonna be
[1:14:40] in heaven, right? But there is a
[1:14:42] specific called group of people that's
[1:14:44] called to get a body change. And the
[1:14:48] only way we're going to do that is by
[1:14:50] getting the right mentality and
[1:14:51] accepting what our identity is and
[1:14:54] fighting for it and pressing into it.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:00] So justification, repentance and
[1:15:01] forgiveness. So justification does not
[1:15:04] mean that God overlooks your
[1:15:05] shortcomings, but that he finds you
[1:15:07] completely innocent of even having
[1:15:09] shortcomings. Repentance does not mean
[1:15:11] graveling for forgiveness for your
[1:15:13] failures. But it means that your way of
[1:15:15] looking at yourself and and at your
[1:15:17] identity has fundamentally changed and
[1:15:20] you now see yourself as a pure sinless
[1:15:22] child of God. Biblical New Testament
[1:15:25] forgiveness does not mean that God
[1:15:26] overlooks your shortcomings, but that
[1:15:28] your faith and your justification
[1:15:30] completely frees you from the effects of
[1:15:32] sin. The true revelation of
[1:15:34] justification automatically leads to the
[1:15:37] correct kind of repentance, which
[1:15:39] automatically leads to the correct kind
[1:15:40] of forgiveness. However, we receive
[1:15:43] whatever level of justification our
[1:15:45] faith grasp on to. And so that's why
[1:15:48] it's so important for us to fight
[1:15:51] contend for the faith. We have to fight
[1:15:53] for the correct revelation of our
[1:15:56] identity because hey, we've all got bad
[1:16:00] days when it's hard
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; fighting spiritually.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Some days when I'm going through and
[1:16:07] things don't look like God's promises
[1:16:09] are popping and I'm like, and I would
[1:16:12] almost rather do manual labor than to
[1:16:14] have to fight than to have to fight
[1:16:17] that. Like, man, no, I'm hanging on to
[1:16:19] the promise. It takes it out of you
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; because your carnal nature is a fighting
[1:16:24] against you.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Now, this is gonna lead up to something
[1:16:27] though.
[1:16:29] If it ain't really you anyway
[1:16:32] that's doing these sinful things that's
[1:16:35] doing whatever, why even care?
[1:16:39] And there's actually
[1:16:42] different times in church history and
[1:16:44] Christian history where Christians were
[1:16:47] like, you know what, if it don't matter,
[1:16:49] let's just do whatever we want to do.
[1:16:51] Like Paul said, all things are lawful,
[1:16:54] but not all things are expedient.
[1:16:56] Expedient means like wise. Let's just be
[1:16:59] foolish and we'll just ask God for
[1:17:00] forgiveness. That's what brother
[1:17:02] Brandham said, making a grace out of
[1:17:03] disgrace. And when when the Lord was
[1:17:06] showing me this, I was like, "But Lord,
[1:17:09] I just can't feel right." Like, "Aren't
[1:17:11] we responsible for what we actually do?
[1:17:15] If he'll just forgive us?" Well, yes, we
[1:17:18] actually are. Exodus 21:28-29.
[1:17:22] If an ox gore a man or a woman that they
[1:17:25] die, then the ox shall sh be surely
[1:17:27] stoned, and his flesh shall not be
[1:17:29] eaten, but the owner of the ox shall be
[1:17:30] quit as far as innocent. Like a man own
[1:17:34] an animal and the animal kills somebody
[1:17:36] else, it ain't that man's fault, right?
[1:17:38] He'll be innocent. But if the ox were
[1:17:41] want to push with his horn in time past
[1:17:43] and it's been testified to his owner and
[1:17:46] he's not kept him in, but that he hath
[1:17:48] killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be
[1:17:50] stoned, and his owner also shall be put
[1:17:52] to death. So there's a principle in the
[1:17:54] bo Bible where if you've got an animal
[1:17:58] and that animal is acting out and you
[1:18:01] don't get that thing under control,
[1:18:03] you're responsible.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus Christ's blood is for all of
[1:18:07] us. But we were all born with an ox. We
[1:18:11] were all born with an animal. You look
[1:18:14] in the mirror, you know what? You're
[1:18:15] seeing a serpent representation of
[1:18:18] yourself.
[1:18:20] Because our carnal bodies are descended
[1:18:23] from a mixture between human and serpent
[1:18:25] seed all the way down. And when you look
[1:18:27] in the mirror, you're seeing that
[1:18:29] serpent representation of yourself. That
[1:18:32] those carnal thoughts, that old man that
[1:18:34] Paul talked about, that's just that
[1:18:37] that's just that carnal serpent nature
[1:18:40] wanting to do things. And every one of
[1:18:42] you have a serpent that it's your job to
[1:18:45] control.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Eve didn't kick the serpent out. And so
[1:18:50] now we're all stuck with one.
[1:18:53] And so it's on us to do what our
[1:18:57] original forefathers did not do. And how
[1:19:00] they submitted to the serpent and got
[1:19:02] kicked out of the Garden of Eden, our
[1:19:04] calling is to conquer our serpent and
[1:19:07] step right back into the Garden of Eden.
[1:19:11] And so we are called to completely
[1:19:14] reclaim everything that our forefathers
[1:19:16] lost. And it's Jesus Christ and his
[1:19:19] blood that came and lived and opened
[1:19:22] that door so that we could do that. But
[1:19:24] it's on us to fight to get back to
[1:19:28] there. And that's how we mature.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus or Adam and Eve, they were on easy
[1:19:35] street.
[1:19:37] Have you ever wondered or have you ever
[1:19:39] wished that God would say, "You know
[1:19:40] what, buddy? You fought enough. How
[1:19:43] about I just recreate everything, make a
[1:19:45] perfect little situ? How about I create
[1:19:47] a perfect garden for you and put you in
[1:19:48] it? No issues.
[1:19:51] If you're not mature enough, you know
[1:19:52] what you're gonna do? You're gonna
[1:19:54] you're gonna mess up the first time you
[1:19:56] come across a serpent. Adam and Eve were
[1:19:59] created in a perfect condition.
[1:20:03] And they messed up
[1:20:05] in a perfect condition. We are called to
[1:20:09] be in an imperfect condition and go back
[1:20:11] to a perfect condition. But we can't
[1:20:14] look and get upset because God makes
[1:20:15] things too hard on us. Things being easy
[1:20:18] on folks without character is what put
[1:20:21] us in this condition. God needs to put
[1:20:23] us in trials so that we get some
[1:20:26] character and then we'll be just fine
[1:20:28] whether we're in a trial or not.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:20:34] in Ephesians
[1:20:36] chapter 2, we're going to look at verse
[1:20:39] one and verse six. And you hath he
[1:20:41] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:20:43] and sins. Why were you dead? Because you
[1:20:45] didn't have revelation.
[1:20:47] You were just living your carnal whims,
[1:20:50] your carnal urges, and you didn't
[1:20:51] understand what was going on. You were
[1:20:53] living in death. You were living under
[1:20:55] the control of that carnal nature.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; In verse six, he's like, "And hath
[1:20:59] raised us up together and made us sit
[1:21:01] together in heavenly pa places in Christ
[1:21:03] Jesus."
[1:21:05] So if we accept and use the full
[1:21:08] revelation of what the blood does for
[1:21:10] us, it places us even right now
[1:21:14] with Christ. Where is Christ right now?
[1:21:18] He's sitting in his father's throne with
[1:21:20] his father's authority. Where does that
[1:21:22] place us? If we hang on to that
[1:21:25] revelation of who we truly are, it puts
[1:21:28] us in the father's throne with our
[1:21:30] father's authority.
[1:21:32] And so that is what revelation is
[1:21:35] talking about and how they overcame him
[1:21:38] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:21:40] their testimony. The blood of the lamb
[1:21:42] is what gives you that revelation and
[1:21:44] what opens that door so that you can
[1:21:46] have the identity
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; that I am part of Christ's bride. I am
[1:21:52] in Jesus Christ's body. I am the body of
[1:21:54] Christ and I am right now seated in
[1:21:57] heavenly places in Christ. You have to
[1:21:59] have that revelation. You have to fight
[1:22:02] for it. That is the battle that we're
[1:22:04] facing.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:22:08] so we get the whole point of the blood
[1:22:11] of the lamb now because it's a two-fold
[1:22:13] what? It's a two-fold thing. The way
[1:22:16] they overcame by the blood of the lamb
[1:22:17] and the word of their testimony. Okay?
[1:22:20] So, if we're wanting to reach adoption
[1:22:22] and maturity, we have to accept and
[1:22:25] fight for that revelation. But there's
[1:22:27] also something else. The word of our
[1:22:29] testimony. Let's look what it says.
[1:22:31] Joshua 1:8. This book of the law, what's
[1:22:34] that? The Bible, shall not depart out of
[1:22:38] thy mouth,
[1:22:40] but thou shalt meditate therein day and
[1:22:42] night, that thou mayest observe to do
[1:22:44] according to all that's written therein.
[1:22:47] For then thou shalt have make thy way
[1:22:50] prosperous, and then thou shalt have
[1:22:53] good success. Who wants to be prosperous
[1:22:54] in here?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; I believe in a prosperity gospel.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; I do. I don't mean let's all go get
[1:23:00] filthy rich and roll around with sports
[1:23:03] cars or whatever.
[1:23:05] But when God is in your life, you are
[1:23:08] satisfied and you are content. And truly
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; truly when you look at any major anyone
[1:23:16] that God has completely surrendered to
[1:23:18] Christ,
[1:23:20] they definitely go through trials and
[1:23:22] tribulations. We all look at Job. Boy,
[1:23:25] Job had it rough. Boy, he had it rough.
[1:23:28] And we talk so much about how God had
[1:23:30] Job go through so many trials. Man, that
[1:23:33] man was filthy rich and awesome and
[1:23:35] happy and prosperous the majority of his
[1:23:37] life. We we focus on this one little
[1:23:40] space in time of when he went really
[1:23:43] through a really rough trial. But it
[1:23:45] said after the trial, he's way better
[1:23:46] off than even before the trial. But we
[1:23:50] look at it like I'm I'm just being Job
[1:23:52] today. Are you really being Job? How
[1:23:55] good what how good did you have it
[1:23:56] before now? And how good do you expect
[1:23:58] to have it after this?
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; We tend to skew everything because what
[1:24:03] do our what does our carnal nature do?
[1:24:05] It tends to be pessimistic and I can't I
[1:24:08] can't help it. Trials are coming and I
[1:24:11] can't control them. And actually, it's
[1:24:13] your carnal nature trying to control
[1:24:15] them. And most of the time, if your
[1:24:16] carnal nature got your way with trying
[1:24:19] to control something, you'd end up worse
[1:24:21] off than than you did without the trial
[1:24:23] to begin with. Because our carnal
[1:24:26] nature, it's enmity against God. It
[1:24:28] can't even figure out how to do
[1:24:30] something right.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; I can't take my dog and expect to train
[1:24:35] my dog on how to appropriately handle my
[1:24:38] responsibilities.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; There just ain't nothing in it. Right?
[1:24:43] There's nothing in that dog's head that
[1:24:45] can conceive of it. Right? That is your
[1:24:48] carnal nature. You have to understand
[1:24:50] it's just an animal thinking. It's just
[1:24:53] that old man, right? It can't get the
[1:24:57] things of the spirit. There's nothing in
[1:24:59] it to do that. And so often when you
[1:25:03] find yourself frustrated,
[1:25:06] it's that carnal nature you're
[1:25:08] identifying with. That's why you're even
[1:25:10] feeling frustrated.
[1:25:13] Because do we truly believe that
[1:25:16] everything is in God's hands? Do we
[1:25:19] truly believe that he's got it all in
[1:25:21] control?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Do we truly believe that he's moving it
[1:25:25] all for our good?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Then if suddenly there's a boom and we
[1:25:30] look out and every one of our vehicles
[1:25:31] is burning in the parking lot right now,
[1:25:34] that shouldn't cause a spike in our
[1:25:35] blood pressure or pulse at all. Be like,
[1:25:37] "Thank you, Jesus. You just gave me a
[1:25:39] blessing."
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; If we properly had our carnal natures
[1:25:43] are in control, it' just be like, "Oh,
[1:25:46] thank you. Thank you, Lord."
[1:25:48] Because if we truly were aligned with
[1:25:52] believing he had it all in control and
[1:25:54] everything worked for our good,
[1:25:55] everything that happened, we'd get
[1:25:57] excited like, "Yay! Hey, you got cancer.
[1:26:00] Awesome." Right? Because we're truly
[1:26:04] trusting. But it's that carnal nature
[1:26:05] that don't want to trust. It can't trust
[1:26:08] because it it's not spiritual.
[1:26:11] It's enmity against God. It just can't
[1:26:14] pick it up.
[1:26:16] And so
[1:26:18] if thou shalt confess with thy so being
[1:26:21] prosperous Romans 10:9, if thou shalt
[1:26:23] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:26:25] shalt believe in thy heart, thou shalt
[1:26:28] be saved. So it's more than just with
[1:26:29] your mouth. You've also got to believe
[1:26:31] what you're saying, right? 1
[1:26:34] Thessalonians 5:16-18,
[1:26:36] rejoice evermore.
[1:26:39] Pray without ceasing. In everything give
[1:26:42] thanks, for this is the will of God in
[1:26:44] Christ Jesus. concerning you. So Paul is
[1:26:47] teaching
[1:26:49] there's something for you to do. And
[1:26:51] sometimes we know when we're really
[1:26:53] going through rough stuff, sometimes
[1:26:55] it's all we can do to say a thank you
[1:26:58] Jesus.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; I mean it might just exhaust us.
[1:27:05] But that's the fight. That is the
[1:27:08] correct maturing. It isn't just putting
[1:27:10] up with trials that matures us. It's
[1:27:12] putting up. It's going through trials,
[1:27:16] accepting our identity, the blood of the
[1:27:18] lamb, and speaking our word, the word of
[1:27:22] what God has said about us, speaking
[1:27:24] that over ourselves.
[1:27:28] 1 Timothy 6:12, fight the good fight of
[1:27:31] faith. Lay hold on eternal life, where
[1:27:33] unto thou art also called, and hast
[1:27:35] professed a good profession before many
[1:27:38] witnesses. We're fighting.
[1:27:42] Hebrews 3:1, "Wherefore, holy brethren,
[1:27:44] partakers of the heavenly calling,
[1:27:46] consider the apostle and high priest of
[1:27:49] our profession, Christ Jesus." Hebrews
[1:27:53] 4:14, "Let us hold fast our profession."
[1:27:58] Hebrews 10:23, "Let us hold fast the
[1:28:01] profession of our faith." Again, coming
[1:28:04] back to Revelation 12:11, "And they
[1:28:06] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[1:28:08] and by the word of their testimony. and
[1:28:11] they love not their lives unto the
[1:28:12] death. To mature the way that we ought
[1:28:15] to, we must first accept the full
[1:28:16] revelation of our true identity, which
[1:28:18] is that we are even now spotless,
[1:28:21] sinless, all powerful messiahs that are
[1:28:24] impervious to the effects of sin, but
[1:28:27] also accepting the responsibility of
[1:28:29] containing the carnal impulses of the
[1:28:31] sinful animal bodies that we've been
[1:28:33] born into. We have to accept our true
[1:28:36] identity and say, "Yeah, I got to
[1:28:37] control this behavior." But on the other
[1:28:40] hand, I'm not identifying with it. That
[1:28:42] isn't really me.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; I've tried to explain it like this. How
[1:28:48] many here has interacted with a
[1:28:50] computer?
[1:28:52] Okay. How many here has interacted with
[1:28:54] like a computer game in which you're
[1:28:56] sitting there running the controls and
[1:28:58] the little dude on the screen is doing
[1:28:59] the thing, right? Okay.
[1:29:03] Would it be healthy if you identified as
[1:29:06] that little thing? No. and you're trying
[1:29:09] to control it. You're realizing it ain't
[1:29:11] you, but there can be glitches and that
[1:29:13] thing ain't doing right.
[1:29:16] You're responsible. You're in control,
[1:29:17] but there's glitches in the system and
[1:29:19] it's not correctly obeying you. So,
[1:29:22] you're doing your best to control it,
[1:29:24] but you don't identify and take on the
[1:29:26] fault if that thing does the wrong
[1:29:27] thing. You just accept, oh, there's a
[1:29:29] glitch in the system. The same way goes
[1:29:32] for this. You do your best to control
[1:29:35] this carnal nature and your emotional
[1:29:37] responses and everything. But when it
[1:29:39] acts out, realize there's a glitch in
[1:29:41] the system. This carnal nature is
[1:29:43] strong, but don't ever identify with the
[1:29:46] thing.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; You claim your identity as being a child
[1:29:49] of God. And you keep claiming dominion
[1:29:52] over that.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Right? Don't ever identify
[1:29:57] with it, then it gets stronger because
[1:30:00] then your faith is creating that
[1:30:02] strength. Right?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And so Romans 5 3-5, and not only only
[1:30:10] so, but we ourselves glory in
[1:30:13] tribulations, knowing that tribulation
[1:30:15] workketh patience, and patience
[1:30:18] experience, and experience hope, and
[1:30:21] hope maketh not ashamed, because the
[1:30:24] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:30:27] by the Holy Ghost, which given which is
[1:30:29] given unto us. So Paul's talking about
[1:30:32] what we know love, maturity. Paul's
[1:30:35] talking about we need to go through
[1:30:36] tribulations because that brings
[1:30:38] experience and and patience and maturity
[1:30:41] and that is what sheds the love of God
[1:30:44] abroad. Okay? And so it's you have to
[1:30:48] accept your identity, but you also have
[1:30:51] to speak that.
[1:30:53] And so if it's something that the
[1:30:55] devil's trying to do in your life, you
[1:30:57] have to speak victory over that. If
[1:31:00] there's something going on, a situation
[1:31:02] that you're in, you have to speak
[1:31:03] victory over that. And you have to do it
[1:31:06] with hope. You have to do it with joy.
[1:31:07] You have to do it with thanks.
[1:31:08] Thankfulness. Not a it's Monday. Yeah. I
[1:31:12] got to do what I got to do to get that
[1:31:13] paycheck.
[1:31:15] No. If your carnal boss don't like that
[1:31:17] attitude, why would Jesus like that
[1:31:19] attitude, right? We need to do it with
[1:31:22] thanksgiving. Now, here's the thing.
[1:31:24] Carnally, you're working for a paycheck.
[1:31:27] You're going to need another paycheck
[1:31:28] after that one. Man, the paycheck we're
[1:31:32] going to get from Jesus
[1:31:34] is going to be so good. We don't care
[1:31:36] what comes after it. We should be
[1:31:39] motivated for this one, right?
[1:31:43] And I just want to tell you a little bit
[1:31:44] a little story before I uh before I
[1:31:46] close.
[1:31:48] This all came to me because several
[1:31:52] years ago I was having some issues. Um,
[1:31:56] y'all know I'm a vet. I deployed. Okay.
[1:32:00] Well, I came back not a happy person. I
[1:32:03] came back kind of angry, right? And as
[1:32:06] years went on, the symptoms got worse
[1:32:08] and worse until they were pretty severe
[1:32:11] until it got to the point I realized,
[1:32:13] man, this is horrible. Okay. So,
[1:32:16] truthfully, it got to the point that I
[1:32:19] was working in the prison. time
[1:32:21] they took me out of working in the
[1:32:23] prison because they're like, "The way
[1:32:24] your anger issues are, you're going to
[1:32:26] hurt somebody one day more than you
[1:32:28] should hurt them, right?" And so, like,
[1:32:30] it was I just say is is bad. It was real
[1:32:33] bad. And so, I'm living and I'm I'm
[1:32:36] going to my therapy and I'm not knocking
[1:32:38] it and I'm taking my psych meds and I'm
[1:32:40] not knocking it, but it wasn't it wasn't
[1:32:43] changing things. Not the way things need
[1:32:45] to change.
[1:32:47] And I'm like, Jesus, I'm at my wit's
[1:32:49] end. What do I do?
[1:32:52] And he showed me this this verse re in
[1:32:55] Revelation. They overcame by the blood
[1:32:57] of the lamb and the word of their
[1:32:58] testimony. And he showed me what the
[1:33:01] blood of the lamb does. It opens up your
[1:33:03] access to your true identity. And the
[1:33:05] word of your testimony,
[1:33:07] it opens that up. That your identity is
[1:33:10] what gives power to your testimony. We
[1:33:13] all know positive thinker. the power of
[1:33:15] positive thinking. And man, I mean, it
[1:33:18] does work some. It's called the placebo
[1:33:20] effect in the medical field. It's just
[1:33:22] your basic carnal faith. And if you
[1:33:24] focus on it and you visualize it and you
[1:33:26] say it over and over again, it increases
[1:33:28] the chances of it actually occurring.
[1:33:31] But that ain't God. That's just a law of
[1:33:33] faith that God has put in reality and
[1:33:35] carnal people can tap into it.
[1:33:38] But
[1:33:40] when a child of God gets the revelation
[1:33:44] of who he or she is
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; and they get the revelation that the
[1:33:48] word of God is about you.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; We are the spiritual heritage of
[1:33:54] Abraham.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; That means all the blessings that go to
[1:33:57] the Jews are for us.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; We are Christians. We get all the
[1:34:02] blessings of the New Testament as well.
[1:34:04] So every promise in the book is mine.
[1:34:07] Right. But you got to fight for it. If
[1:34:11] he just gives it to you, you're not
[1:34:13] fighting and you're not maturing. You
[1:34:15] got to fight for it. That's why the
[1:34:18] Bible, that's why Joshua said, every bit
[1:34:22] of ground that the sole of your foot is
[1:34:24] on.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; You got to put it all under your feet
[1:34:28] and it becomes yours. I can't just say,
[1:34:30] "Oh, I want that back door." I got to
[1:34:32] walk myself back and take that back
[1:34:34] door. And that's what it's all about.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And how do things come to us? How do we
[1:34:41] know they're coming to us? Because it
[1:34:43] happens to us in our life.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Stay where
[1:34:47] you're supposed to be, right? Don't go
[1:34:48] out on the devil's ground."
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Well, so you be doing what you should be
[1:34:53] doing and the trials that come your way,
[1:34:55] you can just accept, well, these are the
[1:34:56] trials for me. I'm not over there
[1:34:58] borrowing a trial from him and going
[1:35:00] over trying to do this, that, or the
[1:35:01] other. I'm staying where I should be.
[1:35:03] And as time will just bring time will
[1:35:06] bring you plenty of trials you don't
[1:35:08] need to find anymore.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; And when they come to you, that's your
[1:35:12] trial to claim your victory on. And you
[1:35:16] claim your identity and you speak your
[1:35:18] word of God over yourself. And that is
[1:35:20] what will bring it to pass. And it might
[1:35:22] take you like Abraham 20some years.
[1:35:26] Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; And Abraham messed up so many times
[1:35:29] during that 20some years trying this way
[1:35:32] to make it happen, trying that way. That
[1:35:34] was just his carnal nature getting in
[1:35:36] the way.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; He didn't stop claiming it.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; He kept on pushing and it finally
[1:35:42] happened. So don't think, man, I messed
[1:35:44] up again. Well, if a man without the
[1:35:46] Holy Ghost, Abraham, can be forgiven and
[1:35:49] eventually claim his victory, Jesus
[1:35:52] Christ has already died for you. You're
[1:35:54] good.
[1:35:55] And so you just keep fighting. You just
[1:35:58] keep pushing.
[1:36:02] And so this is what God showed me. And
[1:36:04] so I started claiming I don't have anger
[1:36:06] issues. Well, it's awful hard to claim
[1:36:09] that you don't have anger issues after
[1:36:12] you just kind of blasted somebody.
[1:36:15] Like you feel kind of bad. And the thing
[1:36:18] is is if you just explode at somebody,
[1:36:20] especially with somebody you love,
[1:36:23] you can't say, "Well, I know you're
[1:36:25] crying right now, but bless God, I ain't
[1:36:26] got no anger problems." Right? Look,
[1:36:30] your bull just gored somebody. You're
[1:36:34] responsible for that thing, right?
[1:36:37] But what I what he showed me, I would to
[1:36:41] myself. I wouldn't be saying it like, I
[1:36:43] mean, you ain't got to be blasting. Hey,
[1:36:45] I mean, I'm going to do this and that
[1:36:46] and do you and say, "Well, you know,
[1:36:48] bless God. God forgave me." You know,
[1:36:50] no, I hurt you, right? That wouldn't be
[1:36:53] right. On the other hand, I had to claim
[1:36:55] it for myself. And I remember the first
[1:36:57] time I tried to say, "Thank you, Jesus.
[1:37:00] I don't have anger problems." I was by
[1:37:02] myself and I couldn't say it out loud
[1:37:06] because it was so entrenched the issues
[1:37:08] I was having. I couldn't make my mouth
[1:37:11] move to say that. All my mouth could
[1:37:13] move was say a lot of other stuff, but
[1:37:15] it couldn't get that out. It was all I
[1:37:17] could do to just think that thought.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; But I had to I started claiming that in
[1:37:22] my heart until it became I managed to
[1:37:26] squeak it out and I've got a big mouth.
[1:37:29] I don't even need this microphone,
[1:37:30] right?
[1:37:32] I couldn't even hear myself say it. It
[1:37:34] was so quiet. And I was fighting as hard
[1:37:37] as I could to try to claim that promise
[1:37:39] for myself. But I did and I managed to
[1:37:43] get it out and it made it a little bit
[1:37:46] easier and I got it out again and I got
[1:37:48] it out again. Right. Well, so I'm
[1:37:51] starting to do this and I'm doing it
[1:37:53] quietly on myself. I'm not saying it out
[1:37:55] around other folks because number one,
[1:37:57] that would hurt their feelings because
[1:37:59] this this animal, this bull was still
[1:38:02] it's still acting crazy. It's still
[1:38:04] acting a fool. But even in the face of
[1:38:07] me having anger issues and doing that,
[1:38:09] I'm claiming I don't. And it got easier
[1:38:12] and easier to claim.
[1:38:14] And then one day I was like, I haven't
[1:38:16] taken my psych meds in a few days. I
[1:38:19] wonder if anybody's noticed. And I asked
[1:38:21] her and she hadn't noticed. I was like,
[1:38:23] oh. So I quit taking them. And then
[1:38:26] things went on and my therapist finally
[1:38:29] looked at me and he was he had tears in
[1:38:31] his eyes. And this was a therapist that
[1:38:32] worked with vets, right? He had been
[1:38:34] around some rough stuff and he with
[1:38:37] tears in his eyes, he said, "What's
[1:38:39] changed?" And I told him I was claiming
[1:38:42] the word of God over myself.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; And
[1:38:52] he said, "I wish I could get everybody
[1:38:55] to believe like you." He said, "I'd be
[1:38:57] out of a job." And that's what I did.
[1:39:00] And I did that month in and month out.
[1:39:02] And then once my an once my behavior
[1:39:05] started straightening up a little bit,
[1:39:07] then I started, you know, putting public
[1:39:09] testimonies across, you know, the
[1:39:11] pullpit at church. I like to thank God
[1:39:13] for helping me with my anger. Right now,
[1:39:16] I'm still fighting with this carnal
[1:39:18] nature.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; If you don't give me the breakfast I
[1:39:22] want, I might not act appropriately.
[1:39:25] That's a joke. I'm not quite that bad.
[1:39:30] But with that being said, I am not even
[1:39:34] close to what that was.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Now I during this time period
[1:39:47] during this time period, I never had a
[1:39:49] big spiritual experience.
[1:39:52] I never had it where the Holy Ghost hit
[1:39:54] me and I fell out. And I'm not knocking
[1:39:57] that because I've had those experiences
[1:39:59] before and I loved them. And actually,
[1:40:01] that's what I kept begging God to give
[1:40:03] me when I was going through this. And he
[1:40:06] said, "No, because I want to teach you
[1:40:09] how to fight."
[1:40:11] Because too often when people are going
[1:40:14] through trials, they beg for just
[1:40:16] deliverance out of it. And the very
[1:40:18] point you're in this life is to go
[1:40:20] through this because you have to mature.
[1:40:24] You can't get to rapture ready until you
[1:40:27] fight that devil tooth and nail for
[1:40:29] every bit of ground you walk on.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; That is what it's about.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:40:36] that is just that's the revelation
[1:40:38] that's been burning on my heart for the
[1:40:40] past seven I don't know 2015 to now. So
[1:40:44] about 10 years or so. That is right
[1:40:46] math, right? Okay. Anyway, so for about
[1:40:49] the past 10 years, and that's what's
[1:40:52] been doing it, and I've just come to see
[1:40:55] that this is the way to conquer. And the
[1:40:58] more I see in his word, this is what
[1:41:00] it's all about. He'll bail you out every
[1:41:03] once in a while to keep your faith up
[1:41:04] and show you he does care. You know
[1:41:06] what? And I'm not knocking that. Brother
[1:41:08] Brandham said, "Cry. You're God's child.
[1:41:11] You should cry because that's what
[1:41:13] babies do to get what they need." I'm
[1:41:15] not knocking that whatsoever.
[1:41:18] But he's going to keep you in trials.
[1:41:21] Some trials he's going to keep you in.
[1:41:22] And you're going to have to walk in that
[1:41:24] thing day in and day out. And you're
[1:41:26] going to have to walk through that
[1:41:27] valley of the shadow of death because
[1:41:30] that is what brings about the maturity
[1:41:33] of the rapture, of your body change, of
[1:41:35] adoption. That is what it's about.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve fell because they were
[1:41:40] taking it easy. We can't take it easy.
[1:41:44] We have to Well, like Paul said, gird up
[1:41:46] your loins like a man, right? Suck it
[1:41:49] up, buttercup. We're here to be in a
[1:41:51] fight. And hey, when the battle's over,
[1:41:54] I'm going to be flying around with wings
[1:41:56] and riding horses in the sky, and it's
[1:41:59] going to be awesome.
[1:42:02] But as long as I'm here right now, every
[1:42:06] day, fight.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; You have to focus on the two things. The
[1:42:13] blood of the lamb and the word of your
[1:42:14] testimony. The blood of the lamb is what
[1:42:16] opens the door to your identity. Mature
[1:42:19] into it and fight for it.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; That's what it's about. If the musicians
[1:42:23] could come
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:42:34] I just like to close with one last
[1:42:35] verse. Third John 1:2.
[1:42:39] Beloved, I wish above all things that
[1:42:43] thou mayest prosper and be in health,
[1:42:47] even as thy soul prosperth.
[1:42:50] Because a lot of times when we're going
[1:42:51] through trials, we'll think, well, you
[1:42:53] know, maybe God just wants me to be this
[1:42:57] way.
[1:42:58] God doesn't want us to be this way. He
[1:43:01] may allow us to have specific things,
[1:43:04] but he wants us to fight against them.
[1:43:07] Brother Brandham said even if a sickness
[1:43:09] was going to kill him, he would he would
[1:43:11] die claiming healing.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; And in fact, he fought anxiety to the
[1:43:16] point that it messed his health up until
[1:43:19] the last year of his life. And he never
[1:43:22] quit claiming his healing. And then the
[1:43:24] wings of a snow white dove, God showed
[1:43:27] him, you've just got it. And he fought
[1:43:29] that for years. And that's what we've
[1:43:31] been called to. So don't give up. Don't
[1:43:33] lose heart. endure until the end.
[1:43:37] Because all of creation,
[1:43:41] the birds, the deer, the sun, and the
[1:43:44] moon, they're all waiting. Even the
[1:43:47] saints in heaven are waiting
[1:43:51] for us to get our body changed.
[1:43:54] Jesus Christ saved us. But if we can't
[1:43:58] take that and step back into our Garden
[1:44:00] of Eden condition again, the full
[1:44:03] purpose of his dying has not been met.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; He's waiting on us. That's why it says
[1:44:09] the bride hath made herself ready or the
[1:44:11] his wife has. So God bless y'all. Amen.
[1:44:15] [Applause]
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; I surrender. Amen. Let's stand and
[1:44:23] worship the Lord for a minute. Amen. God
[1:44:25] bless you, brother Matthew. Very good.
[1:44:27] The more that I
[1:44:31] surrender,
[1:44:34] the lighter
[1:44:36] my love.
[1:44:40] The more that I release my parents,
[1:44:46] the more he takes control.
[1:44:50] [Music]
[1:44:52] The more
[1:44:54] I can humble myself,
[1:44:58] the more he lifts me up.
[1:45:03] Every day I live.
[1:45:08] Lord, I love you more.
[1:45:13] Amen. How many's glad for that message
[1:45:15] tonight? Amen. I ain't never heard him
[1:45:18] preach before. Amen. And so that was
[1:45:21] very impressed. That was very good.
[1:45:23] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. That was
[1:45:26] food you can eat on. Amen. How many
[1:45:29] believe that? So, praise the Lord. We're
[1:45:30] going to let brother Josh sing a song or
[1:45:32] two and close whenever he gets ready.
[1:45:34] God bless y'all. And thank you, brother
[1:45:36] Matt. Thank you, God. Amen. Amen.
