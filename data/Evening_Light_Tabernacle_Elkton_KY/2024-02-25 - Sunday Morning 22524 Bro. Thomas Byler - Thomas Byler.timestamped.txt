[23:51] was a big miracle really amen amen so we
[23:55] appreciate the way that things went as
[23:58] far as offices and everything I'm happy
[24:00] with everything I think everybody's
[24:02] doing a good job amen and that's on my
[24:04] behalf you know but everybody has a vote
[24:07] so if you don't like something or
[24:08] whatever you have a vote coming but amen

[32:01] the Lord oh man I've been so fired up on
[32:03] the way here I'm about to bust at the
[32:04] scen man I was on the way here and the
[32:06] Lord just started ministering to my
[32:07] heart you know I was like thinking about
[32:09] this message this message of the hour
[32:10] ain't just painting that's it's become a
[32:14] reality you know Alpha and Omega
[32:16] becoming one becoming a reality you know
[32:19] burning within us you know oh man it
[32:21] just had me so fired up I was about
[32:23] busting out right here I was like so
[32:25] it's kept me thinking about I just heard
[32:26] a song other day this guy was talking
[32:28] about uh uh when we get over in heaven
[32:31] he said uh angels are going to be bound
[32:33] their head yeah you can hear I'm some
[32:36] I'm so pumped up I'm telling you what
[32:37] praise the Lord but uh uh he said uh you
[32:41] know when we get over in heaven he said
[32:42] the angels are going to be bwing their
[32:43] head well they don't know how to sing
[32:44] Amazing Grace that's right he he said he
[32:48] said it's kind of like around here he
[32:49] said some some of the people when it's
[32:51] uh oh I got Victory in Jesus Victory or
[32:55] Victory in Jesus yeah we can have
[32:57] something to praise and Shout about you
[32:59] know I say you know today we can be free
[33:01] today in Christ Jesus you know it has me
[33:03] all way fired up you know I was just
[33:05] thinking about re revisiting why I'm
[33:07] fired up you know when God visited me in
[33:08] prison in a in a real prison and set me
[33:11] free he set me free then he set me free
[33:13] from drugs and alcohol cigarettes toaca
[33:15] you name it he set me free but then I
[33:17] was still caged up in just a a mindset
[33:19] of going through the motions and living
[33:21] a life you know no Victory no just
[33:23] half-hazard Christian Life what I like
[33:25] to say but when he took down them walls
[33:27] and let me be free in Christ I can be
[33:29] free and Shout Jesus cuz I love the Lord
[33:32] Jesus blessed be his name he broke that
[33:34] for me that's what he's done for me you
[33:36] know so it's got me all way fired up
[33:38] this morning because you know what I was
[33:40] just thinking I don't remember what all
[33:41] I shared when I come back from the
[33:43] prison ministry but it just inspired me
[33:45] so much that that I felt more at home
[33:47] there witnessing to them guys because
[33:49] they was hungry and thirsty for
[33:50] something you know and so when I was
[33:53] there you know it just inspired me it
[33:55] just felt more natural being there with
[33:56] them them guys and uh uh by God's grace
[33:59] y'all just keep praying for me uh uh we
[34:01] got my own thing going now we're trying
[34:02] to get going we're about to be cleared
[34:04] by God's grace we're going to we got all
[34:06] of our names cleared all the brothers
[34:08] are going to be with me here I got
[34:09] Brothers all the way up to Missouri
[34:11] coming with me but you know I believe
[34:13] it's just God on the Move we're going to
[34:15] try to reach out and do something you
[34:16] know Walking With Jesus Outreach so it's
[34:18] God I just pray that you just pray that
[34:20] everybody we come in contact with even
[34:22] between now and then that we can be a
[34:24] living witness it ain't a painted fires
[34:26] power and demonstration of the word
[34:28] become real it just gets me all the way
[34:30] fired up I can't even help it but yeah I
[34:33] just keep on praying but you know I just
[34:35] been seeing God work in miraculous ways
[34:38] you know uh I had so many little notes I
[34:40] could have probably just winged it but I
[34:41] was afraid I'd leave something out here
[34:43] but you know I seen God working in all
[34:45] things working all things together down
[34:47] to the smallest detail of you know being
[34:49] with my wife that led me to you know
[34:52] meeting her uncle that led me to a
[34:54] prison ministry in Florida you know they
[34:56] have me the hookups there you know I was
[34:58] down there I I had a bunch of ministers
[35:00] we was going to we was going to hang out
[35:01] and I was like you know I can took all
[35:02] kinds of books you know of the message
[35:04] of that I'm like okay tonight I'm G to
[35:06] share the message with all these guys
[35:07] we're doing a big Bible study and I kept
[35:09] seeking the Lord and praying about it
[35:11] you know because I didn't you know how
[35:11] many times we can share the message and
[35:13] be out of timing you know so I want the
[35:15] Lord's will and I was praying and uh my
[35:17] devotional that day said uh brother
[35:19] brand said sometimes I just keep my
[35:21] Doctrine to myself and and uh you know
[35:24] uh uh just stick with the word because
[35:26] it can kind of uh hurt your uh uh
[35:29] influence yeah and so I was like I just
[35:30] took it as the Lord's will okay we're
[35:32] not going to share the message so I went
[35:33] on anyway you know and what was crazy
[35:36] here's God working the prison that we
[35:38] was going to every day for like four
[35:40] days straight got locked down completely
[35:42] on Max lockdown so we couldn't go there
[35:44] no more and all the brothers I was with
[35:46] like you know God's doing something we
[35:47] don't know if he was saving our life
[35:49] from killing us or you know or something
[35:50] or moving us to touch somebody else's
[35:52] life well you know what I believe is I
[35:54] bumped into this brother that after
[35:56] being diverted over there I'm talking to
[35:59] him and I get to share my story with
[36:00] these guys and you know and during the
[36:01] worship service we just you know the
[36:03] spirit of the Lord just started moving
[36:04] it was awesome and and he came to me
[36:06] later was talking to me and he started
[36:08] feeling he started talking about man I
[36:10] just want to be fired up like you you
[36:11] know he talking about how uh uh uh uh he
[36:14] ain't getting fed at his church and this
[36:15] and that you know so I be I began to
[36:17] just I started feeling I could see a
[36:19] thirst in him you know and and and as
[36:21] this has been going on I've been talking
[36:22] to this brother ever since then this has
[36:24] been months and months and months ago
[36:25] now and we've been talking and getting
[36:27] fired up together and it's just been
[36:28] laying on heavy on my heart because last
[36:30] week I was with a brother of mine and we
[36:32] were sharing and and when you start
[36:34] seeing you know it made me think about
[36:35] souls that are in prison you don't have
[36:37] to be in prison to be in prison you know
[36:39] we can be in prison in this body we can
[36:41] be you a man-made prison a self-made
[36:44] prison you name it we can be in prison
[36:46] so I just got to thinking on that and
[36:48] and I was going back and forth debating
[36:50] with one of my buddies you know and
[36:51] we're going to the scripture and it's
[36:52] like they can't see nothing but blessed
[36:54] be the name of the Lord we can see and
[36:56] so when I see when I see these people
[36:58] bound up by denominational systems bound
[37:01] up by religious uh you know ideology
[37:04] that they they're so smart that they
[37:05] work their way right out of it you know
[37:07] and and being a brother you know going
[37:09] way back you know it's just saddening to
[37:11] me you know what I'm saying because you
[37:12] want to see him free in Christ like we
[37:14] are and so so the more I I witnessed to
[37:17] my buddy see he he the reason why I'm
[37:19] sharing a lot of this is because as
[37:21] we've been talking he's been growing and
[37:23] he was talking about the scales just
[37:24] falling off of his eyes he lives off all
[37:26] the way up at the tip top of mouri right
[37:29] by Iowa he's 20 years old married Little
[37:31] Couple and just on fire for God but he's
[37:33] bound up by minight traditions and now
[37:36] God's been opening his eyes and he's
[37:37] ready to be free I told him he was an
[37:39] eagle all along I told him there was
[37:41] something the Deep call the deep and and
[37:43] now that it's just been becoming more
[37:44] real to this brother becoming more real
[37:46] and so he's going to come down and spend
[37:47] a weekend with us you know weekend after
[37:49] next the painting weekend and all that
[37:51] and we're all going to fellowship and
[37:53] everything and so I've just been
[37:54] mentoring him and as we've been sharing
[37:56] The Sword and and and and and he's been
[37:59] carried and yielding that sword you know
[38:00] you get stronger if you went to battle
[38:02] picked up a heavy sword you to use it
[38:04] because it's going to wear you down but
[38:06] when you use it all the time it becomes
[38:07] a reality and it's it's God in us
[38:10] becoming flesh blessed be the name of
[38:12] the Lord so it just gets me fired up to
[38:14] see him and and I've been watching him
[38:16] grow so when him he said the other day
[38:19] yesterday he was telling me about his
[38:20] dad coming over there and they get to
[38:21] talk and he's like you know cuz they've
[38:23] been telling him why don't you cuz he's
[38:24] like you know he got caught up and he's
[38:26] like if you got prove it scripturally
[38:27] he's just showing it's a manm tradition
[38:29] that's your ideology he's like you know
[38:31] his dad and they come say oh I'm afraid
[38:33] you're going to lose your salvation he
[38:34] said I can't lose my salvation that's
[38:36] your man's idea he said I I'm basing it
[38:39] on the word and he started using it he
[38:40] said I went away from there just feeling
[38:42] so so good because he said I even went
[38:44] back to the scripture and make sure I
[38:46] was right they went back and forth like
[38:47] two hours I said that's what I like to
[38:49] hear because you know you want to know
[38:50] where you stand on the word but now that
[38:52] you've been using it you know and I said
[38:54] you know I believe he could even be a
[38:55] witness to his own uh family you know
[38:57] but but seeing it but seeing him grow
[38:59] you know it's just so awesome because
[39:01] you know uh as he's wanting to be free
[39:04] that's that deep call of the deep but
[39:06] he's entertaining on coming down this
[39:07] way and uh so I just think it'd be such
[39:10] a blessing for all of us just to you
[39:11] know really welcome him and you know
[39:13] there bunch of young couples you know
[39:15] they going to be excited to see him you
[39:16] know and I had another little testimony
[39:18] I had answered a phone call the other
[39:20] day that uh the doctors have been
[39:22] texting me and emailing me and
[39:24] constantly calling me and trying to get
[39:25] me to set up a
[39:26] you know I kept praying the Lord you
[39:28] know I had something in my mind that if
[39:30] if it goes this way we'll do it you know
[39:32] I I've been ignoring the cause and I
[39:34] thought it might have been a the Trust
[39:36] Company calling me so I answered the
[39:37] call and then she told me who she was
[39:39] okay yeah yeah I let her go on and say
[39:41] everything and uh and you know because I
[39:42] said I always thought you know what I
[39:44] don't know it could be uh a a box of
[39:47] rattlesnakes it could be something
[39:48] trying to put fear and doubt in my mind
[39:50] I don't know but I told her ma'am I said
[39:51] well I just want to tell you by God's
[39:53] grace he's healed me I said there won't
[39:55] be no more needing for setting up any
[39:57] other appointments for me I I won't need
[39:59] no more visits and and she just shouted
[40:01] she said pray the Lord you know
[40:03] something just stirred in her heart
[40:04] because you know what I I'm Healed I
[40:06] don't need to look back I don't need a
[40:08] Vindication the Vindication is Christ in
[40:11] me living through me why am I gonna go
[40:13] look back what if he says you still up
[40:15] you still got a terror I don't care what
[40:16] you say I don't have a terror I told her
[40:18] I'm 100% whole and I'm doing everything
[40:20] they said I couldn't do because God Is A
[40:22] Healer but you know it's just like as we
[40:25] see we want is uh you know see the and
[40:28] my conclusion is this is I just been
[40:30] sharing with people friends people that
[40:33] I've been inviting I was like you know
[40:34] I've seen the transformation to me over
[40:36] the past year of my church body you know
[40:39] how how inspiring it is to see it start
[40:41] growing as a family and start seeing the
[40:43] spirit of the Lord move in unity and in
[40:45] power you know when he comes down in the
[40:47] midst of us and we welcome his presence
[40:49] we invite him to come down into our
[40:51] hearts and speak to each one of us each
[40:53] and every time we come and as we do this
[40:55] it's just it's just been so inspiring to
[40:57] me to even share that with brothers and
[40:59] sisters that God is on the Move he's
[41:01] ready to get us ready to get on out of
[41:03] here so as we become it one even
[41:05] together as a little body a little
[41:07] assembly you know I'll tell the Lord all
[41:09] the time I'm like it's fine and dandy
[41:10] all these things big churches are doing
[41:12] but what about our little body Lord we
[41:14] want our little body to have everything
[41:16] they because we're just as much as them
[41:18] as they are of us bless it be the name
[41:20] of the Lord so it just got me uh but
[41:23] what even more fires me up and I I'll
[41:26] get off the stage here but what gets me
[41:29] the most fired up is when I go
[41:31] witnessing to brothers and sisters and
[41:33] things and and you see them Bound by
[41:35] denominational systems you see them
[41:37] bound up in addictions you see them
[41:39] bound up in their self you see them
[41:41] bound up in everything even to to think
[41:43] they just going to live life and go
[41:45] through the motions but when we can come
[41:46] in here and praise God freely we can
[41:49] praise him with a shout we can praise
[41:51] him with a song we can praise him on the
[41:53] work because we know we're following the
[41:54] real Vindicated truth that is such a
[41:56] blessing for us and it gives each one of
[41:58] us something to shout about we ought to
[41:59] be so fired up that we don't want to be
[42:01] them Angels clothing thereo clothing we
[42:04] are to just be shouting to the hilltop

[1:18:39] did not intend to read it in that way
[1:18:42] amen when I first came up here but I
[1:18:45] thought that with uh the last verse of
[1:18:47] the 27th chapter Psalms I thought it
[1:18:50] went along with it because I did intend
[1:18:52] to read that at some point in time the
[1:18:54] last verse which is verse six it says
[1:18:58] and now shall mine head be lifted above
[1:19:00] mine enemies round about me therefore

[1:19:55] want to set it time anybody in a hurry

[1:20:00] brother Tim PR last week said we only
[1:20:02] have one service on Sunday he says he

[1:20:41] the Lord much could be said things that
[1:20:44] I wouldn't be have enough wisdom to go
[1:20:46] into but we know that in the days of
[1:20:48] Solomon you know Solomon built the
[1:20:49] temple of God and it was a magnificent
[1:20:51] thing amen even so much until I think it
[1:20:54] the disciples marveled at it and said
[1:20:56] you know told Jesus look at how great
[1:20:58] this Temple is and so forth amen because
[1:21:00] it must have been prestigious or some a
[1:21:03] really great work of art amen and it had

[2:04:02] compete H and all of a sudden it don't
[2:04:06] look good it don't look good but guess
[2:04:10] what the green light flashes on the
[2:04:13] yellow that
[2:04:15] green there they go and the B just got
[2:04:18] to leave that
[2:04:19] Lamborghini why not because of it was
[2:04:23] because of what was under the hood and
[2:04:25] that's the way it is with you and I
[2:04:26] don't matter what you look like I don't
[2:04:28] care if you're spending Little David if
[2:04:29] you're a sham God power under the hood
[2:04:32] the enemy better watch
[2:04:40] out David didn't look like much but the
[2:04:43] glory of God was beautiful it was
[2:04:47] beautiful
[2:04:51] I wish I could fall but I better not it
[2:04:54] was beautiful when David a me took that
[2:05:01] sling go I felt something where did that
[2:05:05] thin little come that little blood come
[2:05:07] out the front of his head a gap that
[2:05:10] wide in his helmet and it made the
[2:05:15] Gap I'm sorry I just don't think David
[2:05:18] was that
[2:05:19] good sorry David I don't think you were
[2:05:22] that good they'll have to correct me in
[2:05:24] heaven but I don't think he was that
[2:05:26] good I think it was a Divine thing of
[2:05:29] almighty God he didn't come with a sword
[2:05:32] and spear but he came by the power of
[2:05:35] almighty God but B says and that's what
[2:05:38] you are doing we're basking in the
[2:05:40] beauty of the resurrection of Jesus
[2:05:42] Christ the power of the Resurrection oh
[2:05:46] I can't all things in this world put
[2:05:48] dong it's so ugly so that I might know
[2:05:50] the power of the
[2:05:52] Resurrection how many with me that's
[2:05:54] what I want to know this 2024 I want to
[2:05:56] know in the power of his
[2:05:58] resurrection the beauty of the
[2:06:00] Resurrection in the

[2:06:14] [Applause]
[2:06:17] church well I didn't expect to preach
[2:06:20] that
[2:06:23] hard but I just yielded to him it's not
[2:06:26] me it's him right this is this is me
[2:06:29] getting out of the way and let him have
[2:06:30] his
[2:06:33] way better bad knows all about

[2:06:49] the word is nighty amen the glasses are
[2:06:52] nighty amen praise the
[2:06:55] Lord
[2:07:02] okay it took
[2:07:05] pressure to make Jesus what he was I
[2:07:09] think brother Brad a few sermons ago he
[2:07:12] had actual how much pressure that it
[2:07:14] takes to make a diamond that
[2:07:17] right
[2:07:19] schematics of it and so forth but it
[2:07:21] takes an immense amount of pressure to
[2:07:23] create a diamond that's what it took to
[2:07:26] make Jesus perfect in the way that he
[2:07:28] was took meal pressure and that
[2:07:31] Perfection that he had he handed it to
[2:07:33] you how manyan believe that he gave that
[2:07:36] to you but he still takes you and I
[2:07:39] through pressure to bring the beauty of
[2:07:42] himself out of it brother pH touched on
[2:07:44] it and I didn't expect to go this way
[2:07:47] but I will amen
[2:07:52] let me
[2:07:53] see you see brother Brandon I'm sitting
[2:07:55] here waiting for the prayer
[2:07:58] line in other words people waiting in
[2:08:00] the prayer line to get
[2:08:02] healed and he says God's working that
[2:08:04] just exactly for the
[2:08:06] good why was it that little precious
[2:08:08] little boy the other day stricken blind
[2:08:11] when he was born that guide God might
[2:08:13] get glory and turn a city upside down I
[2:08:17] imagine John Ryan turned to place upside
[2:08:18] down too don't you amen some of those
[2:08:21] people amen the woman at the well she
[2:08:22] went to the city and many believed that
[2:08:25] he was the Messiah because of her
[2:08:26] testimony amen God knows what he's
[2:08:30] doing God knows and he puts us on on an
[2:08:34] as sheep in order to show Glory show his
[2:08:38] glory to us amen so this morning I say
[2:08:42] this friends after 31 years of ministry
[2:08:46] after 31 years of toils on the field I
[2:08:49] want to make my testimony this I have
[2:08:53] seen
[2:08:55] disappointments I have seen time that
[2:08:58] I've asked for things and cried for
[2:09:00] things and begged for things and failed
[2:09:04] to get
[2:09:05] them but if I'll just wait patiently
[2:09:08] upon God then I know that it all works
[2:09:10] just
[2:09:11] exactly right I think that would be a a
[2:09:15] quote that we need to put on our hard
[2:09:17] drive don't you
[2:09:22] amen you see disappointments heartaches
[2:09:26] I answer
[2:09:27] prayer what do you
[2:09:32] do he said be
[2:09:34] patient be patient wait on
[2:09:38] God he knows what he's
[2:09:41] doing and I know it all works exactly
[2:09:43] right comes out just exactly right does
[2:09:46] just exactly the right thing when I lost
[2:09:49] my baby my Sharon my little Sharon that
[2:09:52] was the one thing that stumbled me I
[2:09:55] said how can that be for the
[2:09:57] good amen don't we get to those places
[2:10:01] sometimes people die things
[2:10:04] happen God took brother Bam's little
[2:10:06] daughter and he took his
[2:10:09] wife a mama with two young little
[2:10:14] children God took the baby and he took
[2:10:16] the mama

[2:10:30] this so heartbroke till he put the gun
[2:10:33] to the Head pulled the trigger
[2:10:37] snap I don't know if you did it more
[2:10:39] than once wouldn't go off threw it over
[2:10:41] there and it went off grab power lines
[2:10:45] because he was in such
[2:10:47] sorrow because of the hardships that he
[2:10:50] was going through couldn't do it can't
[2:10:52] take
[2:10:53] it
[2:10:55] hello you say well I've went through
[2:10:58] things where I thought I might just kill
[2:11:00] myself no you haven't been as bad as
[2:11:01] brother
[2:11:02] brandom nope because he didn't think
[2:11:04] about that he did it he was so sad so
[2:11:07] sorrowful he did it he grabbed that
[2:11:09] power line he pulled that
[2:11:13] trigger thank you God thank you for
[2:11:16] protecting him around there
[2:11:18] thank him for laying him down on the
[2:11:20] ground thank you Lord for not letting
[2:11:22] him shoot himself cuz you had a
[2:11:24] work he had a work for him to do and
[2:11:27] even though he wanted to take his own
[2:11:28] life God forbid
[2:11:30] it
[2:11:32] amen
[2:11:36] no oh this is a deep Revelation how many
[2:11:39] believe that you've got a purpose in God
[2:11:41] and you ain't gon to go until he's done
[2:11:42] with you if he cares that much about his
[2:11:45] prophet he does that with every one of
[2:11:46] his children
[2:11:49] amen so we can rest comfortable and be
[2:11:51] at peace can't we now to no no if he did
[2:11:54] that for him he also does that for
[2:11:57] you I know for a fact that God
[2:12:01] controls your
[2:12:03] mind he's got control when you lose your
[2:12:05] control he'll He he'll step in oh he
[2:12:09] will he's that kind of a God he'll give
[2:12:12] you thoughts that you wouldn't
[2:12:14] ordinarily think he'll change your mind
[2:12:15] about
[2:12:17] stuff thank you God I wouldn't be
[2:12:20] standing here probably if it wouldn't
[2:12:22] have been for the fact that he didn't
[2:12:23] let that go off you wouldn't be here at
[2:12:25] this church wouldn't be here none of us
[2:12:28] would be here it be a whole different
[2:12:31] [Music]
[2:12:33] story but can I say something else it
[2:12:36] couldn't go off because God's word Can't
[2:12:40] Fail he will not fail he can do anything
[2:12:44] but fail if people would just realize
[2:12:47] that about the word of
[2:12:50] God there would be a Bible in every
[2:12:53] school we'd be having
[2:12:55] devotions every morning in the school
[2:12:58] sisters there we'd be having devotions
[2:13:00] all right we're going to read a
[2:13:01] scripture it'd be like at my house with
[2:13:04] Donna and the granddaughters we have
[2:13:06] about a half hour or better of good
[2:13:08] devotions and talking about God and
[2:13:10] teaching them things
[2:13:12] amen amen you love
[2:13:15] him can I go a little long this morning
[2:13:18] cuz we're at the time now so this is all
[2:13:20] just a sacrifice to
[2:13:22] God oh we're about done but anyway now
[2:13:25] look where we at that's right how can
[2:13:29] that be for the good how can it be he
[2:13:31] says and months later when I seen her
[2:13:33] standing there in all of the beauty of a
[2:13:36] young girl speaking to me standing by
[2:13:40] the side of that Old Wagon broke down
[2:13:44] there see we got it all figured out
[2:13:46] everything's going to be perfect just
[2:13:47] going to be be broken down wagons
[2:13:52] there God knows what he's doing don't
[2:13:54] don't think he got it all figured out
[2:13:55] all right amen and I know that if I uh
[2:13:59] if she would have lived I know if she
[2:14:01] would have lived she might have turned
[2:14:03] out wrong God had to take her while she
[2:14:06] was yet tender and sweet but I know that
[2:14:09] I'll see her again I know I shall see
[2:14:13] her I know beyond any shadow of a doubt
[2:14:18] brother brah talked about seeing his
[2:14:19] wife and his wife coming back to him and
[2:14:21] whispering and talking to him ain't that
[2:14:23] right press on press on quit worrying
[2:14:26] about me I'm in a good
[2:14:28] place we think oh God was cruel no you
[2:14:32] have no idea the place that he put them
[2:14:34] in they're in a much better place the
[2:14:37] bad the sad part is is the one that's
[2:14:39] left
[2:14:40] here amen that's the saddest part it's
[2:14:43] not the ones that's gone into
[2:14:44] heaven
[2:14:46] amen
[2:14:48] now I notice I know and I think of my
[2:14:51] wife of 22 years old taken just marily a
[2:14:55] girl a little mother there when the
[2:14:58] papers give the headline there young
[2:14:59] mother of Reverend just died oh how hard
[2:15:03] how my heart bled I didn't know what to
[2:15:06] do but today I know that it was all
[2:15:10] working for my
[2:15:14] good but today I know it was all working
[2:15:19] for my good I know the life had to be
[2:15:23] ground and twisted and
[2:15:26] squeezed to get what was in it out of it
[2:15:31] he says there was too much brandom in
[2:15:34] there that had to be squeezed out before
[2:15:37] God could make himself
[2:15:42] known there and I put is instead of was
[2:15:46] there is too much you in
[2:15:51] you how many believe there still too
[2:15:53] much me in
[2:15:56] me man if there's people listening hear
[2:16:00] this Prophet telling there's too much of
[2:16:02] you if you aren't right into place
[2:16:04] walkinging with God the way that you
[2:16:06] should then there is still too much you
[2:16:09] in
[2:16:11] you there was too much of brother branam
[2:16:13] and brother brandom how many knows we
[2:16:16] all know the story of how much it was
[2:16:18] amen when those Pentecostal people said
[2:16:20] come we got got all kinds of invitations
[2:16:22] to go with the gift of healing and how
[2:16:24] many could have been saved how many
[2:16:25] could have been healed in his ministry
[2:16:27] but because his mother-in-law said don't
[2:16:29] you take my my daughter out amongst that
[2:16:32] trash holy roll
[2:16:36] stuff and I I I don't hardly ever say
[2:16:40] anything negative about brother
[2:16:42] bam but it wasn't Hope's
[2:16:45] fault it was not Hope's fault it was
[2:16:47] brother bram's fault because hope said
[2:16:50] I'll go with you I'm with you wasn't
[2:16:52] Hope's fault so brother brandham
[2:16:54] overrode his own wife's encouragement to
[2:16:57] go anyway so there was too much brother
[2:17:00] brandom in there is that right because
[2:17:02] we know it was because of his
[2:17:05] Disobedience God says all
[2:17:07] [Applause]
[2:17:08] right
[2:17:10] yeah even the scripture says that who
[2:17:13] God uses the most most of the time he
[2:17:15] puts them through the hardest trials
[2:17:19] amen but you got to be squeezed out
[2:17:23] why after that God could reflect himself
[2:17:26] when bam get up here he was so
[2:17:29] surrendered to
[2:17:30] God that whenever that Spirit of Jesus
[2:17:34] Christ would come on the platform he
[2:17:36] would yield himself and he'd say you're
[2:17:38] from so and so your name is from so and
[2:17:39] so and you have this problem and this
[2:17:41] out of the other he begin to discern the
[2:17:43] thoughts and intents of the heart
[2:17:44] millions of times WHL over ain't that
[2:17:47] right but says the moment at at the well
[2:17:50] whenever Jesus said you've had five
[2:17:52] husbands and the one you have now is not
[2:17:53] yours she went into the City and a man
[2:17:56] that has told me everything I've ever
[2:17:58] did isn't this the Messiah she knew what
[2:18:01] the Messiah was I mean know we've had
[2:18:03] the Messiah comeing our day wasn't
[2:18:06] brother Brandon but through the prophet
[2:18:08] I manyan know through the body of Christ
[2:18:10] that's what the church is it's the body
[2:18:12] of Christ and God is working that's
[2:18:15] where Love Comes that's where
[2:18:16] forgiveness comes the beauty of Jesus is
[2:18:20] in the body of Christ is in the temple
[2:18:22] of God and God used it in such a way
[2:18:25] amen until it so fits The Headstone
[2:18:28] that's why we've had a
[2:18:30] Ministry so perfect how many believe
[2:18:32] that this ministry is so perfect until
[2:18:36] people thought that brother Bandon was
[2:18:37] Jesus we've had a Min that fits right in
[2:18:40] a Ministry I will say of
[2:18:45] perfection so maybe now God's waiting on
[2:18:47] you you and
[2:18:48] me amen I believe the prophet said one
[2:18:52] place he had play believe that he had
[2:18:53] come to the place of full obedience to
[2:18:58] God Lord help Thomas piler be able to
[2:19:00] say that I've come to the place of full
[2:19:02] Obed I wonder how many listening out
[2:19:04] there can you say I've come to the place
[2:19:06] of full
[2:19:08] obedience you know what I like about
[2:19:09] being the preacher is the holy spirit
[2:19:11] will go out there and he'll show you
[2:19:13] where you're still not where you ought
[2:19:15] to be you know that area you live you
[2:19:17] know where that is the holy spirit if
[2:19:19] you'll pray if you'll just get a little
[2:19:21] bit of guid in you God will show you
[2:19:22] where it is if you don't even
[2:19:25] know most of the times that's what we
[2:19:27] need for God to come more into our
[2:19:28] hearts show us where we're not what we
[2:19:30] ought to be and then let God finish the
[2:19:33] work and bring us to the place that we
[2:19:36] should be
[2:19:39] amen
[2:19:41] amen too much of you and you till God
[2:19:44] had to squeeze it through trials and
[2:19:46] while that squeezing was coming it's
[2:19:48] hard but after a while the sky is clear
[2:19:51] back and you see the purpose of God and
[2:19:54] then you cry I know my redeemer liveth
[2:19:57] and in the last days he'll stand on the
[2:19:59] earth though the skin worms destroyed
[2:20:01] his body yet in my flesh shall I see God
[2:20:04] these little trials and things are just
[2:20:06] for a moment and they fade and they pass
[2:20:08] away but they're only done for your good
[2:20:10] let us remember that that God would
[2:20:15] get the glor
[2:20:18] Amen in closing now brother B preaching
[2:20:22] Amen on the church and after they had
[2:20:24] made it very nice and so forth now I
[2:20:26] think that it's our duty to make the
[2:20:27] inside right by the grace of God to be
[2:20:30] so grateful to God that this will not
[2:20:32] just be a beautiful building that we
[2:20:34] come to but may everyone who comes in
[2:20:37] see the beautiful characteristic of
[2:20:40] Jesus Christ in every person that comes
[2:20:44] here amen when people come they don't
[2:20:46] see just the beauty of of the church but
[2:20:48] they see the beauty of the people the
[2:20:50] character of the people how nice they
[2:20:53] how gent how sweet how Meek amen how
[2:20:57] loving that they are amen listen may it
[2:21:02] be cons a consecrated place to our Lord
[2:21:05] a consecrated people for no matter how
[2:21:08] beautiful the structure is and that we
[2:21:10] certainly do appreciate the beauty of
[2:21:12] the church is the character of the
[2:21:14] people and I trust that he'll always
[2:21:18] be a house of God of
[2:21:21] beauty amen can I read you one that we
[2:21:26] missed we'll read one that we missed and
[2:21:30] it has to do with brother bandam talking
[2:21:32] about a flower that has a sweet
[2:21:35] fragrance a sweet fragrance of a flower
[2:21:43] amen he says that flower is pretty I
[2:21:46] love it pretty flower I think of that
[2:21:49] like I do how pretty the flower is it
[2:21:51] blooms and it's got
[2:21:55] fragrance and the passor by smells it
[2:21:58] and the animals come by and smell it but
[2:22:00] now look it's pretty like the Church of
[2:22:03] the Lord Jesus Christ it's the most
[2:22:05] glorious thing Divine healings Powers
[2:22:09] wonders signs Miracles freedom from sin
[2:22:14] it's a beautiful place yes but look if
[2:22:17] that Rose will have to come list to the
[2:22:19] church like all nature the rose being
[2:22:22] pretty he says every cow in the country
[2:22:25] would lick it on it and so forth if you
[2:22:27] could and and now Nature has provided
[2:22:30] little
[2:22:32] bayonets a little spear sticking out
[2:22:35] there called Thorns how many knows in
[2:22:38] every Thorn you know those those
[2:22:40] wonderful Rose of are
[2:22:45] thorny so the church
[2:22:47] is beautiful it's got free grance but
[2:22:49] it's also a little bit
[2:22:54] thorny now notice little Spears sticking
[2:22:58] out there call thorns and they keep they
[2:23:01] keep them away it protects them that's
[2:23:03] right Al know I think today if we
[2:23:05] haven't got the sword of the word
[2:23:07] sharper than any two-edged sword around
[2:23:09] the beauty of the power of Holiness of
[2:23:12] God he said then we're going to let
[2:23:13] every cow in the country lick it and
[2:23:14] call it and gum it amen and being in dep
[2:23:17] in other words amen this sweetness This
[2:23:19] Love This Joy this fragrance that we
[2:23:22] have sometimes the preacher has to come
[2:23:23] out here and say now be careful don't
[2:23:25] you let the devil shoot you with some
[2:23:27] kind of poison don't you do this and
[2:23:29] don't you do that why to keep the evil
[2:23:31] spirits away from us to keep them from
