[43:14] he's going to deliver us whatever our
[43:15] problems are this morning
[43:17] you just got to Simply put your faith in

[43:39] most of all our need Lord is to express
[43:41] the love and adoration that we have for
[43:44] you this morning Lord desire Lord
[43:47] request that we're on the thing this
[43:50] morning about all these people that have
[43:51] great needs Lord both physically

[44:23] just ask and believe this Lord in your
[44:24] precious name amen the children can this
[44:28] be dismissed for Sunday School
[44:30] and uh for the reading this morning
[44:34] if you'll turn to the 85th psalm
[44:41] I'll try to slow down
[44:44] I'll probably start reading this before
[44:45] you all get to
[44:48] the chapter if I'm not careful
[44:53] and that's the 85th psalm
[45:01] I think we're all there and I'll start
[45:02] with the first verse it's only 13. Lord
[45:05] thou has been favorable unto thy land
[45:07] thou is brought back the Captivity of
[45:10] Jacob
[45:18] thou has taken away all thy Wrath thou
[45:21] has turned thyself from the fierceness
[45:23] of thine anger
[45:32] will thou be angry with us forever what
[45:35] thou draw out thine anger to all
[45:37] generations
[45:44] tell us by Mercy O Lord and Grant honor
[45:47] grant us thy salvation
[45:50] here
[46:02] surely his salvation is nigh to them
[46:05] that fear him that the glory May dwell
[46:07] in our land
[46:15] truth shall spring out of the earth and
[46:17] righteousness shall look down from
[46:19] heaven
[46:27] and all this together 13 first
[46:28] righteousness shall go before him and he
[46:31] shall fed us in the way of his steps you
[46:34] can all be seated this morning
[46:38] and if you would turn to
[46:43] Romans
[46:45] the sixth chapter but I was going to
[46:48] this is
[46:49] I read out of this sometimes but this
[46:52] was the uh this is uh
[46:55] it's not a product it's just a
[46:56] devotional book for GIS during World War
[46:59] II
[47:00] but I thought this one was pretty good
[47:02] and it really it's no different for the
[47:05] these young men in 1940 1941 1942 than
[47:11] it is for us this morning and this is a
[47:13] pretty good one to come the scripture
[47:15] that this uh Presbyterian Minister uses
[47:19] is you don't I'll just read the verse it
[47:21] comes out of Matthew
[47:24] the fifth chapter and verses uh 13.
[47:31] Jesus says here you are the salt of the
[47:34] earth but if the salt has lost his
[47:36] savior wherewith shall ye be salted so
[47:39] basically Jesus is telling us as
[47:41] Christians this morning you have to have
[47:43] that experience you have to have Christ
[47:46] in your heart in life so that you're
[47:48] salty so people see something in you
[47:50] that they want uh doesn't mean that are
[47:54] we perfect every day of Our Lives not
[47:56] but you need to stay with the Lord and
[47:58] be salty so people see something in you
[48:01] that they want to want to become and
[48:03] this is what this man and this is what
[48:05] 80 years but this is what this man wrote
[48:09] and it's pretty funny Batman and
[48:11] airplanes are good men on mules it says
[48:14] opening statement there which is more
[48:16] important which is more needed for the
[48:19] years we've been working on airplanes
[48:21] and he's talking in his day and age
[48:23] where the airplane was a great invention
[48:25] of his day and age where they were using
[48:28] airplanes to kill thousands and hundreds
[48:31] of thousands of people
[48:32] and praying very little attention to men
[48:35] we made a mistake we would have been
[48:37] wiser to have worked with men and have
[48:40] neglected the planes
[48:43] then we would have had good men on mules
[48:45] instead of bad men in planes wouldn't
[48:49] that have been better and it speaks to
[48:51] our generation too you know now we have
[48:54] nuclear weapons not airplanes on Rockets
[48:57] Generations ago new englanders named
[49:01] can't pronounce this there warned us
[49:03] that we were heading to hell because
[49:05] we're making improved means of
[49:07] unimproved ends basically you were
[49:10] saying our technology we're not using it
[49:12] to better ourselves but we're using it
[49:15] to kill ourselves and we're making the
[49:17] tools for which we do whatever we wanted
[49:20] to do without realizing that the tools
[49:23] would be every bit as effective for evil
[49:25] as for good and you can think of the day
[49:28] and age we're living this morning I mean
[49:30] the the technology that you have at your
[49:33] hands this morning you know it's like
[49:35] good and evil it's your choice how you
[49:38] use that technology but nowadays it's
[49:41] being used more for evil than it is
[49:43] being used for good
[49:45] and the same chemistry the same
[49:47] Machinery the same cleverness the same
[49:49] equipment
[49:50] can help Chief either Heaven or Hell
[49:54] and the other day a soldier barely
[49:55] wounded remarked
[49:58] we'd be better off we'd learn less about
[50:00] chemistry and more about Christ
[50:03] and he goes on that impresses me as an
[50:05] as an intelligent and sound and I'm just
[50:08] adding to this a pretty true statement
[50:11] for his day and age but just think of
[50:13] today's day and age where people can
[50:15] kill each other thousands of miles away
[50:17] from each other better to have good men
[50:20] on mules and bad man in Plants think it
[50:23] over
[50:23] we used to talk about it when I was
[50:25] flying for the Navy in 1918 and 1919 and
[50:29] you got to realize what this man's
[50:31] thinking you know the airplanes they
[50:33] fought uh flew in in 1918 were just
[50:36] fabric covered pieces of wood with
[50:39] engines made of metal on them so you'd
[50:41] think of a hundred years what a
[50:43] difference it makes
[50:45] an important governor and he said if you
[50:47] wouldn't would have known now if you'd
[50:50] have realized how important it is to
[50:51] govern yourselves according and doing
[50:54] and after the war there needing not to
[50:56] be another War
[50:58] and it's kind of prophetic in 1960 or
[51:02] 1970 and he goes on to be God be with
[51:05] you so yeah that's pretty important it's
[51:08] not the
[51:09] technology that's bad it's the hearts of
[51:13] the men that use the technology that are
[51:15] evil and it's their their cleverness you
[51:18] know brother Branham said that in if it
[51:20] hadn't been for the flood you know God
[51:23] God would have the men would have
[51:25] destroyed themselves with without the
[51:27] flood you know they would have stolen
[51:28] just like us if if God doesn't keep his
[51:31] hand on his people mankind will destroy
[51:34] themselves in one day because they just
[51:35] can't help himself but uh going to the
[51:38] sixth chapter here of Romans I was
[51:41] saying that the things that were on the
[51:44] on the thing this morning you know it's
[51:46] just simply Believe In Christ like
[51:48] brother Brown said the ABC says the
[51:51] world gets crazier the world goes off
[51:53] into the deep end
[51:55] you just got to fulfill that simple
[51:57] promise always believe Christ no matter
[52:00] what happens what the world is telling
[52:02] you what is trying to force you to do
[52:05] if it can't go through God's filter it
[52:09] can't go through God's word then we
[52:11] don't need to be doing I'll just read
[52:13] this chapter I I had a some stuff wrote
[52:16] down but I'll just read what Paul you
[52:18] know this is Paul in Romans he's dealing
[52:21] with a Roman Church he's dealt with the
[52:23] Corinthian Church but I'll read everyone
[52:25] I mean you know your Baptist the
[52:28] nominations you know they as a child
[52:31] they make you learn this chapter but
[52:33] I'll just read what it has to say what
[52:35] shall we say then shall we continue in
[52:38] sin that Grace May abound and that's
[52:40] heresy right there you know you don't
[52:43] use your grace for disgrace you use your
[52:46] grace to be just a better man or woman
[52:48] and he goes God forbid how shall we that
[52:51] our dead sin live any longer therein
[52:55] so when you know to do good you need to
[52:57] do good he's saying here no you're not
[52:59] that as many of us are baptized and to
[53:01] Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[53:04] death therefore we are buried with him
[53:06] by baptism into death that like as
[53:09] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[53:11] the glory of the father even so we also
[53:14] should walk in the newness of life
[53:16] so every man and woman here this morning
[53:18] that's been baptized in the name of
[53:20] Jesus Christ when you came out of that
[53:22] water you took the name of Jesus Christ
[53:25] and you have to fulfill the promises
[53:27] that Jesus Christ has for us in the day
[53:30] that we live in this morning for we have
[53:32] been planted together in the likeness of
[53:34] his death which also in the likeness of
[53:36] his resurrection it goes back to that
[53:39] chapter I read I don't know if it was
[53:41] last week of the last second Corinthians
[53:44] the fifth chapter
[53:45] knowing this that our old man has
[53:47] crucified him that our body of sin might
[53:50] be destroyed henceforth we should not
[53:52] serve sin for he that is dead is freed
[53:56] from sin so all of us stand there this
[53:58] morning is the view except that Jesus
[54:00] Christ who's your lord and savior then
[54:02] you stand here this morning reconciled
[54:04] to the Living God this morning that's a
[54:06] comforting thought and if you haven't
[54:08] been I would just encourage you to do
[54:10] that
[54:11] for he that is dead is freed from them
[54:13] now if we be dead with Christ we believe
[54:16] that we shall also live with him knowing
[54:18] that Christ being raised from the dead
[54:20] dieth no more death have no more
[54:22] dominion over him
[54:24] for he that he died he died on to sin
[54:27] once but he be that liveth liveth unto
[54:31] God and that's where we're at this
[54:32] morning likewise reckon you also
[54:34] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
[54:36] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[54:39] Our Lord
[54:41] and it goes back to what I was
[54:43] reading here this morning I hope I don't
[54:45] lose my place
[54:47] is that's what we need more of
[54:49] men that just simply take God I'm not
[54:53] saying you need to ride mules or
[54:55] anything but no matter what the
[54:56] technology is no matter what's going on
[54:58] in the world you're simply doing as God
[55:01] leads you in in this age that we're
[55:03] living this morning it's not in the
[55:05] great thing sometimes you know God might
[55:07] only choose us to do one thing one thing
[55:10] and God has one purpose for you whatever
[55:13] that purpose is
[55:15] it's our whole desire to find what God
[55:18] would have us to do for the age that we
[55:20] live in and I miss my spot but I'll try
[55:22] not to reread everything over again let
[55:24] not sin therefore reign in your model
[55:26] bodies that you should obey in it the
[55:28] lust thereof
[55:29] neither yields ye your members as
[55:31] instruments to unrighteousness on the
[55:34] sin but yield yourselves unto God
[55:36] as those that are alive from the dead
[55:38] and your members is instruments of the
[55:41] righteousness unto God
[55:42] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[55:45] for you are not under the law but under
[55:47] grace and that's a comforting thought
[55:49] this morning you're free this morning
[55:51] and and I know you can I can't say that
[55:54] to myself enough you're free you don't
[55:56] have to be under any bondage this
[55:58] morning any spiritual bombs any other
[56:01] kind of bondage you're free in Christ
[56:02] this morning but then shall we sin
[56:05] because we are not under the law but on
[56:07] the grace God forbid no you're not that
[56:09] to whom you yield yourself servant to
[56:12] obey his servants you are to whom you
[56:15] obey whether of sin unto death or
[56:18] obedience arthritis and that's what this
[56:20] Presbyterian preacher was talking about
[56:22] here in this devotional this morning
[56:24] it's not that
[56:27] it's not that things are bad technology
[56:30] or the things you use every day to be
[56:31] successful or bad it's which side of
[56:35] using it you go to do you go to the evil
[56:37] side or do you go to the good side
[56:40] but God be thankful you are Servants of
[56:42] you are excuse me I'm not going to
[56:45] misread this by God be things that you
[56:49] were the Servants of sin but you have
[56:50] obeyed the heart that form the heart
[56:53] from the form of Doctrine which
[56:55] delivered you being then made free from
[56:57] sin you become the Servants of
[56:59] righteousness I speak after the manner
[57:01] of man because of the infirmity of your
[57:03] flesh for we are giving her
[57:06] yielded your members serviced Uncle to
[57:09] excuse me serviced uncleanness and
[57:11] iniquity onto
[57:13] iniquity even so yield your member
[57:15] Servants of righteousness unto Holiness
[57:17] you got to forgive me because I read
[57:19] longer for some reason my eyes want to
[57:21] fade out sometimes but when you were the
[57:23] Servants of sin
[57:25] you were free from righteousness what
[57:28] fruit have you then in those things
[57:30] where if you are now ashamed for the end
[57:33] of those things is death so your desire
[57:35] should not be to go back to the things
[57:37] you once did your desire to be should be
[57:40] to totally just leave those behind and
[57:42] you shouldn't even be looking back to
[57:44] them anymore does that mean that your
[57:46] enemy uh isn't going to try to have you
[57:49] point back to where you came from now of
[57:51] course he's there every day trying to
[57:54] condemn you and have him you go back to
[57:56] where you come from but Paul is telling
[57:58] us you just got to leave that stuff
[58:00] behind and he goes on to say
[58:03] uh I lost my place but what fruit have
[58:05] you then in those things where if you
[58:07] are now ashamed for the end of those
[58:08] things is death but now being made free
[58:11] from sin and become the servants to God
[58:14] you have your fruits onto Holiness in
[58:16] the end everlasting life so it's the
[58:19] better it's the better choice to make
[58:21] the god Choice the Christ choice is the
[58:24] better choice to make and then everyone
[58:27] should know this
[58:28] for the wages of sin is death but the
[58:31] gift of God is eternal life for Jesus
[58:34] Christ Our Lord
[58:36] you know I was reading there was uh
[58:40] there was a
[58:41] a quote I was reading of brother Brown
[58:43] and was talking what was mentioned up
[58:45] here this morning
[58:47] it's
[58:48] it's pretty simple I I started saying
[58:51] that like brother Brown always taught us
[58:53] to always believe Christ I mean you
[58:56] can't say that enough you can't say it
[58:57] to your children enough you can't say it
[59:00] to your spouse enough always believed
[59:01] well no matter what the situation
[59:04] if God can't be glorified in it we
[59:06] shouldn't be doing it it's pretty simple
[59:08] if you use those principles you'll be
[59:11] successful in the day that we live in

[1:26:43] and amen we was praying that the Lord
[1:26:45] will just help us to be a light
[1:26:47] somewhere and I think that morning
[1:26:48] somebody from Canada called him some
[1:26:51] from some Amish community guy Community
[1:26:54] looked kind of like brother Tommy had a
[1:26:56] big beard and so forth and I guess his
[1:26:58] wife had left him and and his nine
[1:27:00] children on account of him being put in
[1:27:03] the band there in a very strict Army
[1:27:05] community and they kind of pitted them
[1:27:07] his family against him and so he was
[1:27:09] just praying and so forth and and Levi
[1:27:12] had been given people books of the
[1:27:15] Supernatural and so while we were on the
[1:27:16] phone and and then I says you know would
[1:27:18] you like for Levi they send you uh books
[1:27:20] of the supernatural you know brother
[1:27:22] Brandon and so forth and he said yeah
[1:27:24] send it to me so amen the Lord just
[1:27:26] seemed open up ways like that amen spoke
[1:27:29] to another lady a man from England but
[1:27:31] anyway and so the Lord just helped us to
[1:27:33] be a witness amen amen there certainly
[1:27:36] would like to do a whole lot more than
[1:27:38] what we have but amen we'll just wait on

[1:27:51] like we do and
[1:27:55] have a god like we do and to have a
[1:27:58] prophet like we did amen a message like
[1:28:01] we do Amen to know that amen We Don't
[1:28:04] Preach what uh I think as I think uh my
[1:28:07] my first second no my first double first
[1:28:10] cousin amen that I've been witnessing to
[1:28:12] he says well I sure talk to a lot of
[1:28:14] people amen and they have a lot of
[1:28:16] different versions and different
[1:28:17] thoughts on the Bible and so forth and I
[1:28:19] had done Ransom before I said you know
[1:28:21] you know and that's why we needed a
[1:28:24] prophet
[1:28:25] you know because when I have a version
[1:28:27] everybody has a version but hey man we
[1:28:29] need to have that Prophet amen that
[1:28:31] Jesus Christ I mean and I and I told him
[1:28:33] before he says Jesus Christ he would say
[1:28:35] now if I've told the truth if Jesus
[1:28:37] Christ don't come now and do what he did
[1:28:39] when he was here on the earth you don't
[1:28:41] have to believe it
[1:28:42] is that right
[1:28:44] and Jesus Christ would come he discern
[1:28:46] the thoughts and Tents of the heart and
[1:28:48] Jesus and that woman at the world said
[1:28:50] now we know when the Messiah comes he'll
[1:28:52] tell us these things
[1:28:54] she even that Harlot knew that the
[1:28:56] Messiah was going to do and and Jesus
[1:28:59] come and did that thousands upon
[1:29:01] thousands of times and people still
[1:29:03] don't recognize that it wasn't just a
[1:29:05] man boy and Brandon but it was Jesus it
[1:29:07] was the Messiah isn't that right coming
[1:29:09] and showing us the way a man and knowing
[1:29:12] that everything that Prophet said always
[1:29:14] lined up with the word because if an
[1:29:16] angel came from heaven and tells us you
[1:29:18] something different than that word let
[1:29:19] him be a curse amen but anyway I thought
[1:29:22] well I then told you once but anyway
[1:29:24] that you know we don't you're gonna have
[1:29:27] a lot of different opinions but whose
[1:29:28] opinion are you gonna take
[1:29:31] or interpretation isn't that right
[1:29:34] and the Bible says the Lord surely will
[1:29:37] do nothing but he revealeth his secrets
[1:29:39] to his servants the prophets amen and if
[1:29:42] God could you Jesus Christ could come
[1:29:44] and use brother branham's a vision and
[1:29:45] so forth and tell people what the name
[1:29:47] was what's wrong with him were they from
[1:29:48] and so forth and even going back to show
[1:29:51] you what the Eve's color of her eyes and
[1:29:53] the air was hello if he could show you
[1:29:55] that he can truly tell you the truth of
[1:29:57] the word isn't that right
[1:29:59] and so we believe it we believe it
[1:30:01] because it lines up with the word it may
[1:30:03] be not be according to your thought or
[1:30:04] mine but it lines up with the word and
[1:30:06] so amen I just pray that someday he'll
[1:30:09] open up his eyes amen and and help him
[1:30:11] to see because we know that he does take
[1:30:13] the revelation of the spirit to really
[1:30:15] Quicken amen what it's all about
[1:30:18] God bless you let's just bow our heads
[1:30:20] in prayer Lord Jesus we come before you
[1:30:22] Lord and we're thankful Lord Jesus to
[1:30:24] have you to have your Eternal Word and
[1:30:27] father What You Did In Our Generation
[1:30:28] Lord Jesus when there's thousands upon
[1:30:30] thousands of churches and all these
[1:30:33] different ideas and things that you came
[1:30:35] down and you showed yourself alive
[1:30:37] resurrected just like you did Amen to
[1:30:40] the disciples and so forth after you
[1:30:42] come back and you showed yourself alive
[1:30:43] again Lord you've done that to our
[1:30:46] generation Lord Jesus and I know God
[1:30:48] that it'll meet this generation in the
[1:30:50] Judgment for you did not just do it for
[1:30:52] a show but you did it to prove to the
[1:30:54] world that you are alive and well and
[1:30:57] that there is a way there's a truth and
[1:30:59] a life and that way and true in life is
[1:31:01] you Lord we ask God that you'll bless
[1:31:04] the service this morning Father we ask
[1:31:05] Lord Jesus be with me help me Lord just
[1:31:08] convey to the people that which I feel
[1:31:10] you've laid upon my heart to speak in
[1:31:12] Jesus name amen open your Bibles this
[1:31:16] morning amen I want to go to who
[1:31:20] we're going to read scriptures and then
[1:31:22] I want to touch on something else before
[1:31:24] I get into my message and that will
[1:31:26] probably take just a little bit of time
[1:31:28] so
[1:31:29] um let me see here how about Hebrews 6 I
[1:31:33] believe it is the book of Hebrews
[1:31:36] amen
[1:31:44] Hebrews 6 1-3 there
[1:31:47] fore leaving the principles of the
[1:31:50] doctrines of Christ let us go on to
[1:31:52] Perfection not laying again the
[1:31:54] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:31:56] and the faith Towers god of the doctrine
[1:31:59] of baptism and of the laying hand of
[1:32:01] hands and the resurrection of the dead
[1:32:03] and of Eternal judgment this will we do
[1:32:05] if God permit amen amen praise the Lord
[1:32:09] you can be seated this morning amen I
[1:32:12] want to talk about I want to call this
[1:32:14] progression progression amen
[1:32:18] I like that going on to Perfection
[1:32:22] praise the Lord now I wanna I wanna I
[1:32:25] want uh I want to cover something with
[1:32:27] the church here this morning before I
[1:32:29] get into the main part of the service a
[1:32:31] man I know uh you know that I know that
[1:32:35] I just is with the help of the Lord amen
[1:32:38] so if you will turn to your Bibles of
[1:32:40] Genesis I'm going to talk to you a
[1:32:42] little bit about amen what happened in
[1:32:44] the Garden of Eden would that be okay
[1:32:47] amen let's talk about what happened in
[1:32:49] the Garden of Eden for just a minute
[1:32:51] amen we want to have a clear
[1:32:53] understanding Amy and I I didn't even
[1:32:55] realize that that had the wording like
[1:32:57] it did but I mean we want to go to
[1:32:59] Genesis 2.
[1:33:02] Genesis 2. and verse 16.
[1:33:06] it says and the Lord God commanded the
[1:33:09] man saying of every tree of the garden
[1:33:11] thou mayest free freely eat
[1:33:14] but if the tree of the knowledge of Good
[1:33:16] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[1:33:19] the day that thou eatest thereof Thou
[1:33:22] shalt die now how many knows this tree I
[1:33:25] don't know about you but how many knows
[1:33:26] that I don't know about Apple Tree
[1:33:28] because we know that the world believes
[1:33:30] that what happened in the garden is that
[1:33:33] uh an apple was picked off the tree
[1:33:35] isn't that right or an apricot or
[1:33:37] something like that last time I checked
[1:33:40] a tree doesn't have the knowledge of
[1:33:42] Good and Evil
[1:33:44] it doesn't know good in evil but this
[1:33:47] tree knew good and evil in the garden
[1:33:49] is that right
[1:33:50] now we know that after he said that you
[1:33:52] know God made a helpmate for him and so
[1:33:54] forth uh you know a second time and so
[1:33:56] forth but if you go to chapter three now
[1:33:59] the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:34:01] beast of the field which Lord God had
[1:34:03] made
[1:34:04] and he said unto the woman yea hath God
[1:34:07] said ye shall not eat of every tree of
[1:34:09] the garden and the woman said notice how
[1:34:11] he repeated what God Said
[1:34:15] all right and the woman said to the
[1:34:17] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:34:19] Trees of the true but it's a fruit of
[1:34:22] the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:34:23] garden now notice this tree that's in
[1:34:26] the midst of the garden it's the tree of
[1:34:28] the knowledge of Good and Evil all right
[1:34:31] there's a tree there but at the fruit of
[1:34:33] the tree all right Thou shalt not eat of
[1:34:35] it neither shall ye touch it least ye
[1:34:37] die and the serpent said unto the Woman
[1:34:39] Thou shalt not surely die
[1:34:42] have you ever heard the phrase you know
[1:34:44] of getting fed a lie
[1:34:47] fit a line
[1:34:49] that's what the devil was doing to Eve
[1:34:51] he was feeding her something
[1:34:54] isn't that right he was feeding or
[1:34:55] something he was feeding her
[1:34:58] a lie
[1:35:00] all right and the serpent said unto the
[1:35:02] woman shall not surely die for God and
[1:35:04] does know that in the day that you eat
[1:35:06] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[1:35:08] and ye shall be as Gods now get these
[1:35:11] next words knowing Good and Evil
[1:35:16] let me ask you how many more trees were
[1:35:19] in the garden that knew the difference
[1:35:20] there's only two trees that I know of in
[1:35:22] the garden that knew good and evil one
[1:35:25] of them was God God knows
[1:35:28] Good and Evil
[1:35:29] and the other one was this serpent isn't
[1:35:32] that right this serpent knew good and
[1:35:34] evil there's your tree
[1:35:37] and she ate of that she ate his because
[1:35:39] that's what we're doing here
[1:35:41] we're feasting on the word
[1:35:43] right and so she ate that she ate of the
[1:35:47] tree and what did it bring death
[1:35:51] amen all right that's right now notice
[1:35:55] so he says that's right that you'll be
[1:35:57] as Gods knowing good and evil now let me
[1:36:02] read what the brother Benham says about
[1:36:03] it and serpent see this is out of the
[1:36:05] church church age book
[1:36:07] not to get the real meaning of what we
[1:36:09] are about to go into one must caution
[1:36:11] you and keep ever in mind that religion
[1:36:13] spiritual matters if you like are
[1:36:15] composed of two parts that inner wine
[1:36:18] and are as opposite as black and white
[1:36:20] religion and spirit and the spiritual
[1:36:23] world are made of those two trees which
[1:36:26] are in have their roots in Eden both the
[1:36:30] tree of life and the tree of the
[1:36:32] knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the
[1:36:34] midst of the garden amen and no doubt
[1:36:37] had their very branches intertwined with
[1:36:40] each other
[1:36:43] now if you look at that natural it's
[1:36:46] going to look and sound like a natural
[1:36:48] tree
[1:36:51] their branches are intertwined
[1:36:54] but I'll show you that that's not at all
[1:36:56] but it is
[1:36:58] amen
[1:37:00] thus now notice brother Brown because Us
[1:37:02] in the Ephesian church is that same
[1:37:05] Paradox the church is made up of good
[1:37:07] and bad the two Vines huh the two Vines
[1:37:12] make the church they are the wheat and
[1:37:13] the terrorists growing up side by side
[1:37:16] the one is true and the other one is
[1:37:18] false now notice the shall arise false
[1:37:22] Christ false prophets is also a great
[1:37:24] signs so intimate that if it were
[1:37:25] possible they'll deceive the very
[1:37:27] elected so it's going to be intertwined
[1:37:30] branches
[1:37:32] so way back there in the early church
[1:37:34] very short time after Pentecost the
[1:37:36] false Vine got to intertwine itself
[1:37:41] amen around the True Vine and we find
[1:37:44] these Deeds of the Nickelodeon's and
[1:37:46] that spirit is going to be found finding
[1:37:48] the true lion until it is destroyed by
[1:37:50] God why have you got it now in the
[1:37:53] Garden of Eden there were two trees
[1:37:55] standing in the midst of it Juana was a
[1:37:57] tree of life and the other was the tree
[1:37:58] of the knowledge of good and evil man
[1:38:00] must live
[1:38:02] by the Tree of Life what was that tree
[1:38:04] of life Thou shalt not eat of it and
[1:38:07] neither shall not touch it at least she
[1:38:09] died that was the Tree of Life
[1:38:12] amen I shall not surely die that was the
[1:38:16] tree of death standing side by side
[1:38:19] intertwined just as you would going into
[1:38:22] your neighborhood robbing shoulders or
[1:38:24] intermingling with whatever
[1:38:26] amen two people perhaps every Believers
[1:38:28] non-believers all going to the same
[1:38:30] church intertwining intermingling
[1:38:32] talking to each other
[1:38:34] they're having fellowship with one
[1:38:36] another ain't no telling how I'm long
[1:38:38] and how many times Eve's path crossed
[1:38:40] with the serpent and how many times he
[1:38:43] talked to her before he finally
[1:38:44] convinced her you know that it was a
[1:38:47] good it was good if you open up your
[1:38:48] eyes in other words if you'll believe
[1:38:50] what I tell you
[1:38:52] because the second that she opened up
[1:38:54] what did the prophet say the ma the womb
[1:38:56] of her mind and took that in she
[1:38:58] committed spiritual fornication and the
[1:39:00] next time it was a natural fornication
[1:39:03] that she did with
[1:39:06] but first it was a spiritual fornication
[1:39:09] or an adultery so to speak amen and she
[1:39:12] opened up the womb in her mind and she
[1:39:14] ate the fruit she believed what he said
[1:39:16] and it brought death just ask be that
[1:39:18] believeth on me shall never die
[1:39:21] isn't that right
[1:39:23] all right let me go on now notice
[1:39:26] all right man was to live by the tree of
[1:39:29] life but he was not to touch the other
[1:39:31] tree or he would die but man did partake
[1:39:34] of the other tree
[1:39:35] didn't leave
[1:39:37] exactly and when he did death
[1:39:39] entered in by him through sin and he
[1:39:42] became separated from God now that tree
[1:39:44] back there in the Garden of Eden that
[1:39:46] tree was the source of Life the tree of
[1:39:48] that tree which now notice now that tree
[1:39:51] back there in the garden that tree which
[1:39:53] was the source of life was Jesus
[1:39:57] in John chapter 6 through 8 Jesus sets
[1:40:00] himself forth as the source of
[1:40:02] of eternal
[1:40:05] life I just I thought about that
[1:40:07] scripture and then and I was just
[1:40:09] studying something else and I came right
[1:40:11] across it so let me just read it to you
[1:40:13] Jesus says Jesus said in Saint John 6 he
[1:40:15] says verily merrily I say unto you he
[1:40:18] that believeth on me hath everlasting
[1:40:20] life how many isn't it something other
[1:40:21] because of what she believed it brought
[1:40:24] that because of what you believe from
[1:40:26] the Tree of Life it brings life
[1:40:30] amen I am the bread of life your fathers
[1:40:34] that eat man in the wilderness and are
[1:40:35] dead this is the bread which cometh down
[1:40:38] from heaven that a man may eat thereof
[1:40:40] and not die I am the living bread
[1:40:45] I mean it was Jesus himself nothing else
[1:40:47] only the person of Jesus Christ he said
[1:40:50] it's the source of art he is the Tree of
[1:40:53] Life
[1:40:54] amen
[1:40:56] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[1:40:59] live forever
[1:41:03] how many is eating from the Tree of Life
[1:41:05] this morning that's what we come to
[1:41:07] church for is to pick a little bit more
[1:41:09] fruit
[1:41:11] eat a little bit more of the Tree of
[1:41:13] Life
[1:41:14] amen and the bread that I will give is
[1:41:17] my flesh which I will give forth the
[1:41:19] life of the world now notice he says
[1:41:22] that's right he says he here calls
[1:41:24] himself the bread of life he spoke of
[1:41:26] giving himself and so forth that if a
[1:41:28] man Aid he would never die he proclaimed
[1:41:30] that he knew Abraham before Abraham I
[1:41:32] was is that right he prophesied that he
[1:41:35] would give himself as the Living Waters
[1:41:37] and if a man drink he would never thirst
[1:41:39] again but live eternal
[1:41:41] The Great I Am he is the bread of life
[1:41:44] The Well of Life The Eternal one the
[1:41:46] tree of life he was back there in Eden
[1:41:50] in the midst of the garden even as he
[1:41:52] will be in the midst of the paradise of
[1:41:54] God
[1:41:55] amen some have the idea that the true
[1:41:59] treats in the garden are just two more
[1:42:01] tree
[1:42:04] like the rest this is not so for time
[1:42:08] the Baptist cried that the actors laid
[1:42:10] to the root of all the trees which we're
[1:42:12] not talking about natural trees but of
[1:42:15] Christian principles now this is the
[1:42:18] record that God has given us of eternal
[1:42:20] life in this life is in his son
[1:42:26] amen Saint John 5 4 4 he says and he
[1:42:29] will not come to me that you might have
[1:42:30] to life that's the record God's record
[1:42:32] States plainly and clearly that life
[1:42:35] eternal life is in the Sun and
[1:42:37] no other place first John 5 12 he didn't
[1:42:40] have the son Half-Life and he that hath
[1:42:42] not the Son of God hath not life
[1:42:46] amen
[1:42:47] praise the Lord so since the record
[1:42:49] cannot change or be taken or added there
[1:42:51] too then the records stand that his life
[1:42:53] that is the life is in the sons and this
[1:42:56] is so the tree in the garden has to be
[1:42:59] Jesus all right if the tree of life is a
[1:43:03] person
[1:43:04] then the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:43:06] of evil is a person also
[1:43:11] it's a person not a tree amen
[1:43:15] I'm really glad to have that Revelation
[1:43:16] I may notice that three major doctrines
[1:43:18] that somebody wanted brother Branham to
[1:43:20] compromise with the serpency the godhead
[1:43:22] and water baptism
[1:43:24] amen that's his major Doctrine and
[1:43:26] anything contrary to the truth of the
[1:43:29] word and Revelation is false Doctrine
[1:43:31] it's false it's wrong if it's your idea
[1:43:33] if it's mine it's wrong
[1:43:35] amen how many those you don't want to
[1:43:38] hear my idea I don't want to hear your
[1:43:39] idea I don't care about your idea what
[1:43:41] you believe or what Revelation you have
[1:43:43] I want what God's word says
[1:43:45] amen
[1:43:47] because man I'll tell you even as a
[1:43:49] young Christian I mean I was speaking to
[1:43:50] Levi a lot of times young Christians
[1:43:52] still get Revelations oh I got a
[1:43:54] revelation I got a revelation find out
[1:43:56] you will find out that a lot of those
[1:43:58] Revelations are wrong
[1:44:01] I did I did the same thing the other
[1:44:03] thing that I thought that I believed
[1:44:04] that I thought was right it was
[1:44:06] absolutely wrong
[1:44:09] oh
[1:44:11] I don't know if brother bam said he
[1:44:13] takes a revelation to for the serpency
[1:44:14] tonight I know he did say that it takes
[1:44:16] a revelation for the godhead
[1:44:18] but I'm thinking he may have said that
[1:44:20] it wasn't for the serpent seed even if
[1:44:22] you didn't understand the serpent seed
[1:44:24] all you got to do is believe the prophet
[1:44:25] because we're taught that if you don't
[1:44:27] understand it just believe what he said
[1:44:30] amen
[1:44:32] praise the Lord because I don't want
[1:44:34] people out there thinking that we
[1:44:36] believe that it's still a tree and an
[1:44:37] apple
[1:44:39] it's not it's absolutely a person amen
[1:44:42] that was that good tree of Good and Evil
[1:44:44] very obvious how many of these quite
[1:44:46] obvious if you just listen to what it's
[1:44:48] really saying because the Bible is
[1:44:50] spoken in such a way that it's hit from
[1:44:52] the eyes of the wise of prudent as a
[1:44:54] matter of fact this mystery wasn't even
[1:44:56] revealed hardly until this hour
[1:44:57] everybody thought and it was an apple
[1:45:00] but that's on a Perdition amen he was
[1:45:03] exposed in our generation in our day I
[1:45:05] mean ozen showed where he comes from and
[1:45:08] what the terminology the terminology of
[1:45:10] the tree is good for food and it's to
[1:45:12] make one wise in other words you'll be
[1:45:15] smart you'll know good and evil that was
[1:45:17] the good good food that it was supposed
[1:45:19] to be
[1:45:19] and that's what she wanted
[1:45:22] amen all right let me finish this
[1:45:24] episode we'll get our message
[1:45:27] now notice
[1:45:29] all right
[1:45:31] all right so if the tree of life is a
[1:45:33] person then the tree of knowledge of
[1:45:34] Good and Evil was a person we know that
[1:45:36] it was a serpent
[1:45:38] is that right he's the only other one
[1:45:39] guy in there that knew Good and Evil
[1:45:42] he's the one that gave Eve
[1:45:44] the fruit
[1:45:46] and in other words he says this you're
[1:45:48] going to be smart you're going to be
[1:45:50] wise you're going to know and good and
[1:45:51] evil all you got to do is take it all
[1:45:53] you got to do is open up your mind and
[1:45:55] receive believe what I tell you and
[1:45:57] apparently she did she was fooled she
[1:45:58] was deceived
[1:46:01] all right now notice so he says it can't
[1:46:04] be otherwise the evil person is a person
[1:46:06] also it can't be otherwise that's the
[1:46:07] righteous one and the wicked one stood
[1:46:09] side by side in the midst of the Garden
[1:46:12] of Eden it's quite something in it you
[1:46:14] thought well you know wow God made a
[1:46:16] Garden of Eden then right in the middle
[1:46:18] of it he had a he had a person
[1:46:21] all right
[1:46:22] called the tree of the knowledge of Good
[1:46:24] and Evil that if the eight of it they
[1:46:27] would die
[1:46:29] now how many knows that we understand
[1:46:31] why God did that why would God do such a
[1:46:34] thing
[1:46:36] amen
[1:46:38] it was God's plan God knew what Eve
[1:46:42] would do
[1:46:44] even in heaven Satan had a choice of
[1:46:47] whether he wanted to stay with God or go
[1:46:49] over and get a third of the angels on
[1:46:51] his side and that right here but he had
[1:46:53] the power of choice
[1:46:55] and God put that power of choice in Eden
[1:46:57] and he knew that it would fall that we
[1:46:59] would come into this condition isn't
[1:47:00] that right and that he would bring the
[1:47:02] second Adam
[1:47:04] that he would bring that second tree and
[1:47:06] he would give us the Tree of Life mother
[1:47:07] bam says that tree that tree is in front
[1:47:10] of everybody today
[1:47:12] everybody you have to choose whether
[1:47:14] you're going to believe what Jesus said
[1:47:16] are you going to take of the mixed tree
[1:47:18] that's why he says churches are good but
[1:47:20] they're all so bad it's a mixed tree
[1:47:23] people want to do what they want think
[1:47:24] what they want but they still want to
[1:47:26] call themselves Christians
[1:47:28] amen and that's the tree of the
[1:47:30] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:47:32] amen
[1:47:33] praise the Lord
[1:47:35] now here we go
[1:47:36] he says they're side by side in the
[1:47:39] midst of the garden Ezekiel 8 13 says
[1:47:42] Thou Satan has been in Eden
[1:47:46] The Garden of God
[1:47:48] now we know that Satan is a spirit and
[1:47:51] according to the Prophet The Devil's
[1:47:54] Spirit entered into the serpent
[1:47:56] and this evening amen
[1:47:59] here is where we receive the true
[1:48:02] revelation of the serpent seed here is
[1:48:06] what really happened in the Garden of
[1:48:09] Eden and the people said
[1:48:12] and the people said
[1:48:14] amen that's what really happened and
[1:48:17] that's why Saint John 3 12 I believe
[1:48:19] Jesus not as Cain who was of that Wicked
[1:48:24] one
[1:48:26] Cain was of the wicked one that
[1:48:28] certainly wasn't Adam
[1:48:30] no it was from that serpent that's where
[1:48:33] serpent seat came in Amen in most
[1:48:35] denominational churches won't accept
[1:48:38] that most people won't accept that but
[1:48:40] it's the truth nonetheless
[1:48:44] amen all right let me go can we get into
[1:48:47] my message now
[1:48:48] amen I just wanna
[1:48:50] to clear that up and I want every man
[1:48:52] woman boy and girl in here to understand
[1:48:54] the serpent seat I want you to
[1:48:56] understand what happened in the Garden
[1:48:59] of Eden and if you don't you pray God
[1:49:01] give me the Revelation amen
[1:49:03] all right now back to our thought over
[1:49:05] here in First Corinthians because I was
[1:49:08] thinking you know if there's one thing
[1:49:10] that we have a desire one thing my
[1:49:11] desire as a pastor as a preacher and
[1:49:14] that is amen as I Minister as we preach
[1:49:18] and man we want to say something we want
[1:49:20] to do something that will benefit and
[1:49:23] that will edify you
[1:49:26] amen I want to know where you are at
[1:49:28] this morning we want to know where we're
[1:49:30] at it's important that you know where
[1:49:32] you're at with your growth in God
[1:49:34] amen because we want to take you a
[1:49:37] little further with the help of God how
[1:49:40] many believes that God wants us to go
[1:49:42] further than what we are
[1:49:46] oh my praise be to God and I believe
[1:49:49] that's why he said in in Corinthians
[1:49:51] there uh you know he says
[1:49:54] chapter 6
[1:49:56] hold on
[1:49:57] known I'm sorry I keep thinking it's in
[1:50:00] Corinthians it's not Corinthians it's in
[1:50:02] Hebrews where he talks about leaving the
[1:50:05] principles of the doctrines of Christ
[1:50:06] let us go on
[1:50:10] action
[1:50:12] Hallelujah not laying again the
[1:50:14] foundation of repentance so it talks
[1:50:16] about going on to perfection
[1:50:19] praise the Lord
[1:50:23] amen
[1:50:26] how many has a thirst in the longing for
[1:50:29] Perfection Jesus at one place be ye
[1:50:32] therefore perfect even as your heavenly
[1:50:36] father is perfect
[1:50:40] and I got to thinking about and praying
[1:50:42] about what am I going to preach without
[1:50:43] thinking you know there's one thing that
[1:50:45] I believe that no matter how long we've
[1:50:47] been Christians and you don't have to
[1:50:49] look out very far whether you look at me
[1:50:51] or I look at you you find that there's
[1:50:53] still too much of our self in there
[1:50:57] the Shelf things that need to be pruned
[1:51:00] off of us
[1:51:02] we're still not seeing every fault that
[1:51:05] you find around the message or there's
[1:51:06] every fault that you see amen it is
[1:51:09] still an imperfection and you and I are
[1:51:12] scratch you're thirsty and hungering for
[1:51:14] perfection
[1:51:18] come into what I mean by that is coming
[1:51:20] into the full stature of Christ
[1:51:23] amen
[1:51:25] have less of ourselves and more of him
[1:51:29] we want to see God in a greater way in
[1:51:32] our lives we don't want to be in the
[1:51:33] same place that we were yesterday
[1:51:37] because the movie's on brother the move
[1:51:39] is on how many of these whenever that
[1:51:42] Pillar of Fire over the Old Testament
[1:51:43] moves they had better break camp
[1:51:46] they better break cap and follow that
[1:51:48] lighter they're gonna be left in the
[1:51:49] Darkness
[1:51:51] and that's the way it is in our day
[1:51:52] folks when I got into thinking of how
[1:51:54] that uh you know I was up there amongst
[1:51:57] the Amish the very heart
[1:51:59] the very Heart of Darkness the very
[1:52:02] heart of tradition of man that has
[1:52:04] veiled to people and keeping them from
[1:52:07] the word having an effect
[1:52:10] huh
[1:52:12] see I come from the Amish of the Amish
[1:52:14] to how strictest of the Amish
[1:52:18] amen
[1:52:20] and my my
[1:52:22] double first cousin he broke away about
[1:52:24] a year or two ago perhaps in over a year
[1:52:26] so he kept wearing the Amish clothes
[1:52:28] kept wearing the army clothes still at
[1:52:30] everything but now I go back up and he's
[1:52:32] got English clothes on he's got these
[1:52:34] clothes guys dick decent haircut David I
[1:52:36] said you look good I like the way you
[1:52:38] dress I said you finally broke free from
[1:52:40] the Amish tradition
[1:52:43] why because you know others are
[1:52:45] believing the message but they're still
[1:52:46] no like drinking no they're not just the
[1:52:49] strong Amish as you can be
[1:52:51] and why is such an indoctrination until
[1:52:53] it takes time sometimes to break away
[1:52:56] from it
[1:52:57] to get away from it
[1:52:59] I don't know if anybody's out there
[1:53:01] listening to me but people aim it I
[1:53:02] don't understand why people amen that
[1:53:04] put that all down why would you want to
[1:53:06] go back and dress Amish again
[1:53:10] you know some people say well it's holy
[1:53:12] or clean let me tell you something goes
[1:53:13] close to Jesus said you enlarge the
[1:53:16] borders of the garments and so forth
[1:53:18] Amen to make yourself fall it don't do
[1:53:20] anything for you and Jesus even
[1:53:22] condemned it it ain't about that
[1:53:24] to me it would represent slavery that
[1:53:27] well I had to wear those clothes I
[1:53:29] better do what they do and say and so
[1:53:31] forth or it was it's a representation of
[1:53:34] change
[1:53:36] folks when I can put a shirt on I can
[1:53:38] put a tie on
[1:53:39] I can say I ain't gotta I ain't gotta be
[1:53:42] like that anymore I won't be put in the
[1:53:44] band putting a spine
[1:53:48] we went into a restaurant down there you
[1:53:52] know
[1:53:52] come to find out this Levi order
[1:53:56] uh just Levi Yoder and his wife
[1:53:58] I didn't know him from Adam
[1:54:01] but they come and visit him and she said
[1:54:03] you know your mom and my dad or somebody
[1:54:05] else like that were first cousins we're
[1:54:06] related
[1:54:09] after in Lima we went to Lima Church can
[1:54:12] I take my time
[1:54:13] we went to the church in Lima with uh
[1:54:15] Levi and his wife and so forth and and I
[1:54:19] had known that that church was there for
[1:54:20] a while and I expected a bunch of
[1:54:22] old folks I expected the preacher come
[1:54:25] up here and just kind of call him and
[1:54:26] give perhaps a mess and on the message
[1:54:28] or this side of the other and just kind
[1:54:29] of you know kind of dead
[1:54:32] it's kind of what I was expecting
[1:54:35] we started at 6 30 the church started at
[1:54:38] 6 30 and we finally got out at 9 20.
[1:54:43] we almost had a three-hour service on a
[1:54:45] Wednesday night
[1:54:47] preacher jumped so hi-hat the donkeys
[1:54:49] had nothing to hit the ceiling just like
[1:54:51] that
[1:54:53] I shouldn't go I couldn't have jumped
[1:54:56] that high if I tried
[1:55:02] the people were about 15 people wasn't
[1:55:04] very many it's a man
[1:55:06] Jesse Smith is his name brother Jesse
[1:55:09] amen he has a wife and about eight
[1:55:11] children and and there's a few others
[1:55:13] there about 15 people and when they
[1:55:14] worshiped it was just oh my it was the
[1:55:17] top of worship when he had me to come up
[1:55:19] and say a few words I said you know
[1:55:20] y'all may be a small group but you got
[1:55:22] big worship when he got up there he said
[1:55:25] brother Bob he says to let everybody
[1:55:26] tells us that but we just love the Lord
[1:55:29] and I could tell by the man and by the
[1:55:31] way that he was preaching and so forth
[1:55:32] amen he was happy
[1:55:34] he was free you could just tell there
[1:55:36] was an innocence that man was real and
[1:55:38] he obeyed God and he was no he was just
[1:55:40] on fire and of course he had the the
[1:55:42] video up there and the screens and he
[1:55:44] was teaching on music and worship and he
[1:55:46] was going to go down I think the next
[1:55:48] Day 2017 people that got baptized down
[1:55:51] himself uh Ohio
[1:55:53] I thought he was going to go be
[1:55:54] ministering down to them and he was
[1:55:56] going to bring him how that how did you
[1:55:58] know God wants you to worship him on the
[1:56:00] loud symbols and all this that or the
[1:56:01] other and he went through every
[1:56:03] different types of music and all of that
[1:56:05] and downs forward not only preaching but
[1:56:08] under inspiration and it was good I was
[1:56:11] like my Lord I'm sure glad he didn't ask
[1:56:12] me to preach this is a whole lot better
[1:56:15] than I could ever done
[1:56:20] it really did good it was good didn't
[1:56:23] seem no three hours
[1:56:25] hey man
[1:56:32] but anyway I kind of lost my thought and
[1:56:33] tell on the other story but
[1:56:36] I wanted had wanted to go to that church
[1:56:38] up in there and it was guess what it was
[1:56:40] only
[1:56:41] 44 miles away
[1:56:43] well not
[1:56:44] all that far
[1:56:46] amen so it was it was good and I told I
[1:56:48] told him I said boy if you had a vehicle
[1:56:50] this is where you ought to come
[1:56:52] where you get fed good where there's
[1:56:54] worship there's established church
[1:56:56] somebody that knows the message and
[1:56:59] understand it's been in a long time not
[1:57:01] a not a novice
[1:57:03] praise the Lord
[1:57:05] but I got to thinking you know I got to
[1:57:06] thinking when I when I saw that and I
[1:57:08] see people different ones coming out and
[1:57:10] then you've got the arms you got the
[1:57:11] Mennonite you got the uh higher Amish I
[1:57:14] thought the higher Amisha because every
[1:57:16] time you come out you can teach more of
[1:57:18] the word of God
[1:57:19] how many knows that you can actually
[1:57:20] believe more every time you come out
[1:57:24] I didn't know it but they don't even
[1:57:26] really encourage you to read this book
[1:57:28] amongst Amish too much
[1:57:31] do you know that isn't that exactly what
[1:57:33] the pope Did in the Dark Ages he didn't
[1:57:35] want them to have the books and so forth
[1:57:37] Just go with what your priest said
[1:57:40] isn't that sad
[1:57:43] but the higher you go the more Liberty
[1:57:45] they have
[1:57:47] and I thought my you know I drive a mule
[1:57:50] I drop bought that Yamaha mule that
[1:57:52] little side by side and when I hit 45
[1:57:53] miles an hour brother Tommy amen that
[1:57:55] engine stalls out on me
[1:57:59] and I said I've got to have a restrictor
[1:58:02] there's got to be a restrictor up in
[1:58:03] here somewhere right and I thought
[1:58:05] that's about how it is in religions
[1:58:07] there in these cages and they're
[1:58:09] restricted and they can't go further
[1:58:11] they can't get higher they can't climb
[1:58:13] higher they can't grow anymore
[1:58:18] think about you and me think about we
[1:58:21] can climb how we can go higher you can
[1:58:23] go further than what you was yesterday
[1:58:27] you could climb higher than what you
[1:58:29] have been
[1:58:32] that's what I want to do forever you are
[1:58:34] climb a little higher go a little deeper
[1:58:36] in God and then until we get pulling out
[1:58:39] of it in this world till the body change
[1:58:42] comes
[1:58:46] amen praise the Lord
[1:58:50] Hallelujah you love him
[1:58:52] God is good isn't he
[1:58:55] now notice
[1:58:57] better man talks about
[1:58:59] when we come together what do we come
[1:59:01] together for he says we come together to
[1:59:03] find our bad places don't we to find out
[1:59:06] where we can change where we can be
[1:59:08] pruned a little
[1:59:10] and I was I want more of Jesus more and
[1:59:12] more and more if you want more of Jesus
[1:59:15] then you're gonna have to give him a
[1:59:16] little more of you
[1:59:22] prune this off prune that off like Jesus
[1:59:24] says you know every tree that brings
[1:59:26] forth fruit he prunes and it might bring
[1:59:28] forth much fruit God loves to have
[1:59:31] progress in his church God wants
[1:59:33] progress in you
[1:59:35] he wants progressing me to progress
[1:59:42] how much people die like butter Ivan
[1:59:45] I've watched Joey Hendrickson Joe
[1:59:47] Hendrickson and different ones that
[1:59:50] to me
[1:59:52] they were ready to die
[1:59:54] they were ready to go
[1:59:56] they didn't want to really Ivan didn't
[1:59:58] really want to go
[1:59:59] he wanted to have that family he had a
[2:00:01] wife he had
[2:00:03] grandchildren that he wanted you know
[2:00:05] what then he says I'm just one I'm gonna
[2:00:07] go over to be with Jesus
[2:00:09] and he died like a man he died
[2:00:14] ready
[2:00:16] well I could tell he was ready if I
[2:00:18] could go like that just knowing that
[2:00:20] you're ready I mean I believe that you
[2:00:22] and I can get to the place you don't
[2:00:23] have to wait to the Rapture to come to
[2:00:25] Perfection to come to majority or to
[2:00:27] come to the place that you amen where
[2:00:29] you should be
[2:00:30] the prophet made the statement he says
[2:00:32] you're not ready to live until you're
[2:00:33] ready to die
[2:00:35] so you're ready to go guess what now
[2:00:37] you're really ready to serve God why
[2:00:39] because you've whipped yourself out
[2:00:43] thank you
[2:00:45] amen aren't you glad
[2:00:48] Luther it's all a progression
[2:00:51] Luther he only was defeat he was just uh
[2:00:53] you know the countdown he says you know
[2:00:56] Luther was the horse and buggy age
[2:00:59] listen about the H Wesley come along and
[2:01:02] it was the car age
[2:01:04] sanctification a little bit higher than
[2:01:07] Luther was
[2:01:08] and along he says comes in he called him
[2:01:11] a a uh cross-eyed I believe a cross-eyed
[2:01:14] black man amen in Azusa Street amen and
[2:01:17] guess what they had them it was the age
[2:01:19] of the Wright brothers it was the age of
[2:01:21] the airplane he says the natural types
[2:01:24] of
[2:01:24] there's a God reason he says he types of
[2:01:27] spiritual and they took to the skies
[2:01:31] they've been took to the heavenlas and
[2:01:32] so forth and he began to speak in a
[2:01:34] Heavenly language unknown tongues and so
[2:01:36] forth but even that even they had a
[2:01:39] restrictor
[2:01:42] this says you know if you don't speak in
[2:01:45] tongues we don't believe you got it
[2:01:47] and you got to speak in tongues if you
[2:01:48] got the Holy Ghost
[2:01:53] you know at the end of brother bannon's
[2:01:55] Ministry that the Pentecostals even put
[2:01:56] him out because she didn't believe that
[2:01:58] the Holy Spirit speaking in tongues with
[2:02:00] the evidence of the Holy Ghost because
[2:02:02] he had watch Witch Doctor speaking on
[2:02:04] long tongues right make an ink pen raid
[2:02:07] right in the unknown tongue bring tables
[2:02:10] up off the chairs and everything and
[2:02:12] drink blood out of the human skull
[2:02:14] a bunch of witches yes that they know
[2:02:15] just because you speak an unknown time
[2:02:17] that don't mean you got it how many
[2:02:19] people you and I sorry
[2:02:22] Hallelujah aren't you glad to be in a
[2:02:23] higher age
[2:02:25] in a different age
[2:02:27] praise the Lord
[2:02:29] all right
[2:02:33] let me read you a couple quotes is that
[2:02:34] okay
[2:02:36] now remember they couldn't stay still
[2:02:39] that when the pillar of fire moved out
[2:02:41] they come out like Isuzu Street here in
[2:02:44] California that represented the other
[2:02:46] airplane days and so forth God showed by
[2:02:50] the airplanes that his church was Rising
[2:02:52] he shows by the Natural Things what's
[2:02:54] happening in the spiritual they always
[2:02:57] follow
[2:02:58] brother now friends may I say this that
[2:03:01] it has come to the age of astronauts
[2:03:04] we've moved out of the airplane age
[2:03:06] we've gotten more power
[2:03:09] the astronaut HH has come we've come
[2:03:12] into a spiritual astronaut going above
[2:03:14] it's a same Holy Spirit only more power
[2:03:20] isn't that what we all desire
[2:03:22] God give me more of the Holy Ghost give
[2:03:25] me more of the spirit help me to climb
[2:03:27] higher

[2:06:57] preaching don't you think we fussed and
[2:06:59] fought and carried on and stood over our
[2:07:02] organizational boundaries long enough
[2:07:05] let's get off this mountain and move on
[2:07:07] to the promised land
[2:07:08] let's start going up and possess the
[2:07:11] land

[2:07:25] mistake your fathers did are you

[2:07:31] see whether Christian men's organization
[2:07:33] and so forth if you haven't organized it
[2:07:35] you'll stick right here another 40 years
[2:07:37] but it's time that God is calling his
[2:07:40] church to move up
[2:07:42] amen come up
[2:07:46] praise the Lord that's whenever you've
[2:07:49] got to eat that eagle food when you was
[2:07:51] born again he's asking you hurt from
[2:07:54] your theophany
[2:07:56] and that theophany is what I hear
[2:08:00] is calling me
[2:08:03] how many believe you got to see off me
[2:08:07] brother bam says get this in your mind
[2:08:08] now I'm going to close and that's
[2:08:11] him not me we're up
[2:08:17] you always wanted to be imperfections
[2:08:19] you Christians there is a Perfection and
[2:08:22] that Perfection is not in this life but
[2:08:25] every man and woman there that is a
[2:08:26] Christian every person that's in this
[2:08:28] here building that's a Christian is now
[2:08:30] already glorified in the presence of God
[2:08:32] remember Roman says whom he has
[2:08:34] Justified and he has Sanctified we've
[2:08:36] Sanctified he's also glorified
[2:08:38] now let me explain what that means and
[2:08:40] you've got another body
[2:08:42] you won't have some other time you have
[2:08:44] right now right now there's another body
[2:08:46] waiting for you if this one should
[2:08:49] perish
[2:08:50] how many know that if this Earthly
[2:08:53] Tabernacle if this house Paul said is
[2:08:55] dissolved we have one already waiting we
[2:08:59] have one already made
[2:09:01] I may know there's another Thomas farmer
[2:09:03] out there somewhere and because that I
[2:09:05] crave Perfection here shows there's a
[2:09:08] party waiting for me out there if you're
[2:09:10] always evil and thinking evil then there
[2:09:12] is nobody there's nothing but hell
[2:09:14] waiting for you
[2:09:19] depends on what you are
[2:09:21] what are you
[2:09:23] amen what are you on the inside
[2:09:26] praise the Lord
[2:09:28] oh we thirst for it don't we
[2:09:31] praise the Lord yes we do
[2:09:34] we thirst more and more and more
[2:09:42] let's look at that couple
[2:09:45] scriptures that talk about progress and
[2:09:47] elevation would that be okay
[2:09:52] foreign
[2:09:53] Ephesians 4.
[2:09:59] well-known scripture for us verse 11 and
[2:10:02] he gave some Apostles some prophets and
[2:10:05] some of it
[2:10:06] Angela
[2:10:07] some pastors and teachers
[2:10:10] for the imperfecting of the Saints
[2:10:13] no for the perfecting of the Saints
[2:10:15] for the work of the ministry for the
[2:10:17] edifying of the body of Christ till we
[2:10:20] all come in the unity of the faith and
[2:10:22] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[2:10:25] a perfect man
[2:10:28] I can ask a person in here that spinned
[2:10:31] a Christian the longest
[2:10:33] now I would say what is your desire what
[2:10:36] is what do you long for I'm sure they
[2:10:38] would say that I would be more perfectly
[2:10:40] in Christ
[2:10:42] are you with me how many would say I
[2:10:44] want to be more perfectly in Christ I
[2:10:47] want to see less of myself I want others
[2:10:49] to see less of myself
[2:10:51] amen we want to see more of him
[2:10:54] we want to come to
[2:10:56] we want to come to
[2:10:58] unto the measure
[2:11:00] of the stature
[2:11:02] of the fullness of Christ
[2:11:05] amen
[2:11:07] that we henceforth be no more children
[2:11:11] amen
[2:11:13] how many wants to know what a child is
[2:11:16] what is a child
[2:11:19] um
[2:11:20] First Corinthians 3 1 3 1 says and I'd
[2:11:23] rather could not speak unto you as
[2:11:25] spiritual but as unto carnal even as
[2:11:28] unto babes in Christ
[2:11:32] huh
[2:11:34] even as unto babes in Christ I don't
[2:11:37] know about you but it's time to not be
[2:11:40] the baby
[2:11:42] anymore
[2:11:44] time to be a full son and daughter of
[2:11:46] God
[2:11:47] amen I believe this church here
[2:11:49] are you I'm I'll be careful about what I
[2:11:52] say but I believe that most of us are in
[2:11:54] a in a college degree we're up in the
[2:11:56] college so to speak ready to graduate
[2:11:58] we're ready to get our final degree
[2:12:01] maybe another year left or so I mean it
[2:12:04] will be where we want where we need to
[2:12:05] be
[2:12:06] amen
[2:12:07] because I know what some of us weren't
[2:12:09] through I know the trials I know the
[2:12:10] character that some of us has but in
[2:12:12] every Church there's always people in
[2:12:14] every different grade
[2:12:16] we're not all in the same place
[2:12:18] no
[2:12:22] it's kind of like a house that's being
[2:12:23] built we're in the final stages brother
[2:12:26] Tommy we're putting down the baseboard
[2:12:28] we're trimming out the windows we're
[2:12:30] laying the carpet
[2:12:34] well no we can say the carpet's already
[2:12:36] late because you don't want to lay the
[2:12:37] uh the baseboard before the carpet sound
[2:12:39] if you can help it it'll make it easier
[2:12:41] for Tommy that's for sure
[2:12:43] amen so put the carpet down now as soon
[2:12:45] as that trim goes on we're ready to have
[2:12:47] the seats we're ready to have it God is
[2:12:50] almost finished with this Pride
[2:12:52] she's coming into his airberry image
[2:12:56] God is working on how many knows God is
[2:12:58] working on you day by day
[2:13:00] sermon by sermon God is working on you
[2:13:04] getting out all the roots of bitterness
[2:13:07] filling us with his fear giving us
[2:13:09] perfect fade giving us perfect love
[2:13:15] amen I believe it don't you God is
[2:13:18] getting people ready we're way oh my
[2:13:21] we're not bound by tradition
[2:13:23] we're not bound by those barriers
[2:13:26] anymore
[2:13:27] but I thought about this before I go on
[2:13:30] we do have a restrictor
[2:13:33] we have a restrictor
[2:13:38] faith has a restrictor
[2:13:41] oh that don't sound right does it
[2:13:44] all things are possible them to believe
[2:13:46] what are you talking about
[2:13:47] brother bam said if you could have faith
[2:13:49] you could create a world and go live on
[2:13:51] it
[2:13:52] but another place he says but you can't
[2:13:54] have faith for that because it's not
[2:13:56] according to the word of God
[2:13:59] so yeah we have restrictions so
[2:14:00] according to according to prophet of God
[2:14:02] or I'd be making me a world and living
[2:14:04] on it
[2:14:05] if there was no restrictions on us
[2:14:06] because
[2:14:07] if you ask contracts in the word of God
[2:14:10] remember that's just your hope or wish
[2:14:13] but if you stand you are in faith it'll
[2:14:15] be according to the word of God
[2:14:17] amen
[2:14:19] this how we know that he
[2:14:21] hears us James said I believe it was if
[2:14:24] we ask according to his will
[2:14:27] amen because God's Gonna Give You Faith
[2:14:29] to believe something that's a contrary
[2:14:31] to his well he won't give it to you
[2:14:32] that'll be your own mind that goes on in
[2:14:35] there
[2:14:36] so in that way we would have a
[2:14:37] restrictor
[2:14:38] for you everybody understand
[2:14:40] you love the Lord this morning God is
[2:14:43] good isn't he I'm glad Lord
[2:14:45] do some more trim work
[2:14:48] check me down
[2:14:50] have me ready
[2:14:52] that's hard to say I don't like to say
[2:14:54] that because if you tell God to put trim
[2:14:57] work on you and trim you down he's just
[2:14:59] liable to do it and it's not always
[2:15:00] Pleasant
[2:15:03] Amen brother Joe
[2:15:05] that's what he's not always pleasant but
[2:15:07] I don't care how much it hurts I don't
[2:15:09] care what God has to do you just have me
[2:15:12] ready
[2:15:15] that's right I just wanna I just want to
[2:15:19] be ready
[2:15:20] Holy Spirit God Almighty get us ready
[2:15:31] bring every thought every idea of my
[2:15:34] mind captive to the word of God God this
[2:15:37] morning
[2:15:37] Hallelujah
[2:15:40] oh my
[2:15:43] God I like that do not this is the
[2:15:45] astronaut age
[2:15:47] oh my
[2:15:49] let's talk about that for a few more
[2:15:51] minutes would that be okay
[2:15:54] foreign
[2:15:57] page maybe huh
[2:16:05] I don't want to I'm not gonna pass it up
[2:16:07] now he's able to achieve for himself a
[2:16:10] bride he's going to uh in the last days
[2:16:13] be able to get a bride that
[2:16:16] with a ministry that's just exactly like
[2:16:18] his like him man and his wife becomes
[2:16:21] one
[2:16:23] now remember that thought as I go over
[2:16:25] here
[2:16:26] Ministry what does it do
[2:16:30] the astronauts see things that the
[2:16:33] planes and everything else is out of
[2:16:36] date they don't see
[2:16:38] I mean it was the Pentecostal
[2:16:39] splitterbahn he would have to be careful
[2:16:41] about using the word predestination and
[2:16:43] foreknowledge they didn't really like
[2:16:45] the word predestination
[2:16:48] they just couldn't see that they didn't
[2:16:49] they just couldn't hardly grasp that
[2:16:52] they couldn't see it hardly even the
[2:16:54] prophet would have to say I've got to be
[2:16:55] careful in in saying that but it's the
[2:16:57] word of God it's all in the Bible
[2:17:01] oh my
[2:17:04] now notice it was beyond the clouds
[2:17:07] Beyond Creeks Beyond doubt out into
[2:17:09] outer space out of all unbelief outer
[2:17:12] space where they don't hear the chatter
[2:17:13] saying well you can't do it
[2:17:15] nobody will cooperate you can't do this
[2:17:18] you can't do that it doesn't even notice
[2:17:20] it he's an astronaut he's beyond the
[2:17:22] clouds it's too stormy we can't make it
[2:17:26] isn't exactly what those unbelievers
[2:17:28] said
[2:17:30] amen
[2:17:35] I forget the name of it but there was a
[2:17:37] little boy playing something
[2:17:40] uh playing something doing something he
[2:17:42] wasn't supposed to do or a boy and he
[2:17:44] got put in jail for it and his friend
[2:17:46] come in there and and he says hey did
[2:17:49] dad put you in jail for that
[2:17:51] the boy says really
[2:17:54] well I am
[2:17:58] the brother Baptist that's the way with
[2:18:00] miracles signs and wonders people say
[2:18:02] there ain't no days of Miracles
[2:18:05] already happened sorry
[2:18:07] too late to tell me it can't be done
[2:18:11] too late
[2:18:12] I mean I don't do it I mean these God
[2:18:15] does do it
[2:18:17] oh I may believe this time to climb into
[2:18:19] the all things are possible whatsoever
[2:18:21] things you ask in my name I will do it
[2:18:24] but the Bible says he says yes you know
[2:18:25] when you're planted in Christ amen it's
[2:18:28] like a tree that's all you gotta do is
[2:18:30] water and he makes a statement he says
[2:18:32] just more you water it amen you can go
[2:18:34] into deeper death you can go into higher
[2:18:37] Heights and keep going and going and
[2:18:38] going and going and going
[2:18:42] to climb higher in Christ this morning
[2:18:43] than what you are
[2:18:45] how many places coming with you can be
[2:18:47] closer to God than what you was this
[2:18:49] last week
[2:18:55] problem is sometimes we just stay at a
[2:18:57] certain plateau
[2:18:58] we're happy be with our plateau
[2:19:02] where we're at
[2:19:05] Liberty don't you be don't you be keep

[2:19:09] next night you build a fire let it be on
[2:19:11] down the road

[2:19:14] is moving on the holy spirit is moving
[2:19:17] I mean we got to follow that Spiller of
[2:19:20] Fire
[2:19:21] you believe him
[2:19:23] Hallelujah
[2:19:26] oh yeah
[2:19:28] foreign
[2:19:32] that's right we don't hear the chatter
[2:19:34] chatter this that and the other amen
[2:19:39] praise the Lord
[2:19:44] he says it's called The Eagle age in the
[2:19:46] Bible
[2:19:47] he says and we find it over in Malachi
[2:19:51] 4. I mean it knows Malachi 4 start at
[2:19:55] the Eagle age
[2:19:57] called The Eagle age over in Revelations
[2:19:59] to fourth chapter he says to one was the
[2:20:01] face of a lion the face of a man face of
[2:20:04] an ox and the last one was a king
[2:20:07] eagle

[2:20:16] your height

[2:22:34] denominations
[2:22:37] and belong and be the Bride of Jesus
[2:22:39] Christ at the same time because they
[2:22:41] have committed spiritual fornication
[2:22:42] they believe they know that Jesus Christ
[2:22:44] is their father and they try to claim to
[2:22:47] worship God but yet they put their own
[2:22:49] Creeds their own ideas

[2:23:30] tower
[2:23:31] and it's not here like man now notice
[2:23:33] well hold on
[2:23:35] when the astronaut that's in the area
[2:23:37] has something back here back here on
[2:23:39] Earth that controls him it's called a
[2:23:41] radar that radar moves him around shows
[2:23:44] him where he's at
[2:23:47] praise the Lord I hope you're reading
[2:23:48] between the lines I mean if you've got a
[2:23:50] radar you've got the holy spirit that
[2:23:52] leads you that guides you amen
[2:23:57] tells you where you're at
[2:23:59] isn't that good isn't that a good for
[2:24:01] the Holy Spirit to tell you this morning

[2:24:11] where you at
[2:24:19] amen and then ask God to take you higher
[2:24:23] praise the Lord
[2:24:26] notice now the astronaut age
[2:24:30] he says that we're living in the
[2:24:33] astronaut H just as sure as God has
[2:24:34] testified by the natural happenings here
[2:24:36] so is he testifying now that if we've
[2:24:40] that we've achieved an astronaut
[2:24:44] praise be to God
[2:24:49] the Pentecostals they could speak in
[2:24:52] tongues and another one would interpret
[2:24:54] they could prophesy and things would
[2:24:56] happen it would happen in that right
[2:24:58] it would happen but we know that at the
[2:25:01] end what they did but here comes
[2:25:03] somebody along that didn't just have
[2:25:05] prophecy in tongues and so forth but he
[2:25:07] could look right into another dimension
[2:25:09] he could look right into the
[2:25:12] mind of God and he could tell people
[2:25:14] that when they were younger a dog chased
[2:25:16] them and that's why they're so scared
[2:25:18] and why they're nervous
[2:25:20] huh he could tell them where they're
[2:25:22] from what their name is and so forth and
[2:25:23] he could look into it Plum over into
[2:25:25] another dimension it was so much higher
[2:25:28] amen and he talked about he says the
[2:25:31] Holy Ghost made the way for the Holy
[2:25:33] Ghost himself if there's one thing that
[2:25:36] the prophet of God taught us he says
[2:25:38] it's the life that you live by their
[2:25:40] fruits you shall know them not by the
[2:25:42] tongues that they speak not much however
[2:25:44] they prophesy of this side or the other
[2:25:45] but by their fruits you shall know them
