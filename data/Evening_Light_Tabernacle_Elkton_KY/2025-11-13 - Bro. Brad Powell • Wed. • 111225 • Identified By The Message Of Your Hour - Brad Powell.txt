And I I guess that one of the reasons why this song come on my heart, I'd listen to uh statue of a perfect man. And brother Brandham was talking about love and fill my way every day with love. And you know when the testimony they give of brother Brandham said, you didn't know who his enemy or who his friends were. He treated everybody the same. And I said, "Lord, I need a lot of help in that area. I just have to be honest. I need a lot of help." And said, "Lord, when they walk down the street, I don't want them to say there's a grumpy old man, but there's a Christian. There's someone that's kind to everybody and treats them right." That's what I want to be said, that I'm a Christian. Amen. That's my heart's desire. Well, let me walk. Blessed Lord, in the way thou has gone, leading straight to the land above. Well, giving cheer everywhere to the sand and the Lord. Well, fill my way every day with your love. Oh, fill my way every day with your love. Well, as I walk with a heavenly d. And let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Every day with love. Well, keep me close to the side of my savior and guide. Let me never in darkness ro. Well, keep my path free from wrath and my soul satisfied. Well, fill my way every day with your love. Oh, fill my way every day with your love. Oh, as I walk with the heavenly love and let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Now soon my race will be over and I'll travel no more. But abide in my home above. Let me sing blessed king all the way to the shore. And fill my way every day with love. will fill my way every day with your love. Oh, as I walk with a heavenly dove and let me go every day with love. Well, I'm feeling so much better talking about this good old way. I'm feeling so much better talking about the Lord. So, let's go on. Let's go on talking about this good old way. Let's go on. Let's go on talking about the Lord. Oh, the devil he don't like it talking about this good old one. The devil he don't talk talking about the Lord. So let's go on. Let's go on talking about this good old way. Well, let's go on. Let's go on talking about the Lord. Amen. Brother Daniel and brother Michael John, come ahead. Brother Glenn, you can help him tonight. And we have some prayer requests tonight. And brother Steve just asked just handed me a prayer request. Says, "Please remember Sister Aaliyah and Hie in prayer. They've had a rough day. Want to remember them in prayer that God will just give them a touch. Play something softly, Sister Becky, if you would." and and also Sister Becky asked that we'd remember her neighbor Brandy in prayer said she really needs a touch from the Lord. So we just want to remember her and hold her up in prayer tonight that God will just move in a special way for them for her tonight and and I know they've been a great witness to her and but we just pray that God will just move and and we only believe tonight, don't we? And Amen. And also we want to remember our shut in Sister Parish and Sister Peggy tonight. And uh just want to continue them in their in prayer and Sister Parish will get better.

Lord, I believe. Let's stand. Oh Lord, I believe. Oh Lord, I believe. and all things are possible. Lord, I I believe we'll just call brother Brad out to sing it for Jesus is here. Oh Jesus is here and all things are possible for Jesus is here. Oh Jesus is here. Oh Jesus. I'll get you some water. There he is. All things are possible for Jesus is here. Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Good to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Child of God. &gt;&gt; What a what a pleasure. What an honor. What a privilege. If you could, why don't you just have your seats for a few minutes? We got a few few things we need to uh kind of cover and go over. We had mentioned the the saints in Jamaica and we we didn't take time Sunday with the change and different things that we were trying. Thank you, brother David. And with the so with the new pre-ervice and so forth, but we do want to take time tonight to kind of we're going to try to pull up some pictures there. I I did talk to uh Brother Wade Dale. Uh many of you probably know Brother Wade. He's been here many times and you don't if you ever meet him, you'll never forget him. That's just the way it is. It's the man with two first names. Wade Dale. So, uh, but anyway, he's he's been a friend of ours through the years and and an associate with brother Ber over the years. And so, he he's very close with brother Keith Reed in Jamaica and the and the Jamaicans and the situation. I kind of got him to kind of see what all needed to be. And he pretty much I said I said, "What what do they what do they need, you know, and and from your perspective?" And he said, "Just funds, funds." You know, he said, "We was going to send this and send that and they don't need us to send stuff. They've got stuff there. They just need funds to purchase." And so, um, I said, "Well, what are we talking about?" You know, and I said, " 20,000, 40,000." He said, "Well, 20,000 will put a roof on one one church." And uh so um he said I I I don't you know we we can send they'll they'll make sure that it's allotted and be able to fix those churches. So maybe brother Mike if you just maybe pull up one of those pictures there and I guess we'll try to kill these lights real quick. The way they were sent to me. Okay. the way they were sent to me. That's we're a little bit grainy. So, we'll do the best we can with what we got. So, this is a this is one of the churches. I'm not sure if this is Ginger Hill Church or which church that is um or Northampton. I'm not sure. But I I feel like we we've been there. Maybe some of you visited there when we took our trip years ago to Jamaica. So, uh, next picture or video the the pictures you can see the roof is completely gone. The sound systems ruined the it's been uh some of the churches were looted afterwards. Uh, the wind has has you know shifted everything. So, quite a disastrous state. You can tell that the churches were um, you know, primitive to begin with. So, uh, if you could maybe we'll just show one of those videos. We don't want to take a lot of time, but I just want to let you know what the situation is there. I think that's good, brother Michael, on that. That gives you an idea. Like I said, we don't want to take a lot of time, but just the situation what she was saying. I don't know if you could hear it, but in the in the other videos there, she uh was making mention of the uh the roof. They just put that roof on. It's supposed to be a a storm kind of like a storm storm proof roof, I guess. And she said, "I think we got a raw deal." So, you can imagine what it would be like if we were to walk in this next Sunday and that our church looked like that and we've got insurance and we would we would definitely be okay. They don't have insurance. They they don't they just they just have what they have and they they love uh love the Lord. And so, uh, Brother Ber said, "What we'll do is we'll take up an offering this coming Sunday and, uh, we'll make sure that it gets in the right hands." Uh, Brother Wade said he would help us send through his Western Union. Um, because they don't charge as much. And so, you have to have the right avenues or the government taxes and takes and we don't want that to happen. So he's got the right channels and that's what you always have to be very cautious and careful when you're doing any kind of missionary work and work out of the country is make sure that you're funneling through the right channels and make sure things are are handled appropriately. So I think I feel good about it, brother Ber. And if if brother Ber said felt good about it, so we would take up an offering um and just as as the Lord lays on your heart this weekend, we'll make sure it gets there. So, um, also just want to make mention, uh, myself and, uh, brother Tommy and brother Troy will be heading out. I think brother Troy is going to go. We're going to try to drag him along. He he's giving me the nod. So, we're going to be going up to Akaran, Ohio to Brother Jesse Smith's this weekend. Uh, we'll be ministering there on Sunday. Brother Tommy will be giving his testimony on uh, on um, Saturday night, 6:30. Um, if anybody wants to watch, I'm sure you could find it. I think it's the bride of Akran Church. Is that right? I think that's right. So, if anybody wants to watch that and then follow up uh and see see what we've done up there, but we're looking forward to it. Pray for us. It's a it's a it's a pretty long drive up there, but it can be done in a day and we'll we'll leave early Saturday morning, come home Sunday afternoon after I preach. So, um I'm uh I'm pretty excited about it. Go up there and fellowship with brother Jesse and u taking my amen corner with me so I don't have to worry about that. And I I know I have two ameners anyway. So, we'll uh we'll we'll just go with what the Lord leads us. So, stand with me if you would. We'll try to get right into the word and I feel like I've got a lot on the plate tonight and I don't want to hold you long. So, but bear with me. I feel like uh the Lord has given us something tonight special for us. So turn in the book of Isaiah 53. Very familiar scripture. We ought to know this one by heart. And you know before we get into that into that scripture I want to read you what something the prophet said. He said it pleased God the great sculptor. Now think about this. to smite him, to do it this way. We see him here in Isaiah here as I read. We all did esteem him. We turned our face from him. There's no beauty that we should desire him. And everybody talking about him, making fun of him. I'm talking of I I'm talking about him now in this day. Everybody making fun of him. We did esteem him and saw him. Esteem means to look at. We esteemed him smitten and afflicted of God. Yet he, what did he do this for? He was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities, he said. Now, we could go on and on and on with that, but I believe you have the picture of what I mean now, God building back his masterpiece. He says, but let us not forget that in the beginning when he smoked the side of Adam, he took something out of his side. He said, 'Now the smiting of Christ was for a cause that that he might take from him one to be a family, the bride. He said he might take him a bride so that when his masterpiece was perfected, then he had to smite it to take it from him. Not another piece, not another creation, but of the same creation. Oh my my brother. He says, "Don't think bad at this, but think a minute. If he took from him the original creation to make a bride for him, he never made another creation. He took a part of the original creation. Then if he was the word, what must the bride be? It's got to be the original word. Living God in the word." Amen. We could go home on that. God is good. Let's say read Isaiah 53 and we're going to read it all. Who hath believed our report? In whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? So Isaiah here now he's he's speaking and he's thinking as we see this unfolding, who hath believed our report? Who is going to believe that a man such as Jesus who is nothing to look at? He's not handsome. He's not beautiful. Now he's he's marred and he's smitten. Who's going to believe this? And especially now, who is going to believe what he's done this for? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who's going to believe this? And to whom of the arm of uh of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, as a root out of the dry ground. He has no form, no comeliness. When we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised. He's rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. and we hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. &gt;&gt; He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed. &gt;&gt; That's a promise. &gt;&gt; And we all we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned everyone to his own ways. And the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all. &gt;&gt; Our iniquities laid upon him &gt;&gt; by loving God. He was oppressed. He was afflicted. Yet he opened not his mouth. He was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before the hers is dumb. So he opened not his mouth. He was taken from prison and judgment. And who shall declare this generation? For he was cut out of the land of the living. For the transgression of my people was he stricken. For the transgression of Elton, Kentucky. &gt;&gt; For the transgression of the United States. for the transgression of Europe and Africa, for the transgression of the entire world. &gt;&gt; And he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death, because he had done no violence, neither was there any deceit in his mouth. Now, here's the most astounding statement. Yet, it pleased the Lord to bruise him. Wow. It pleased the Lord to bruise him. He hath put him to grief. When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed. He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. He shall see the travail of his soul. He shall be satisfied. By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many. For he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he hath poured out his soul unto death. And he was numbered with the transgressors, and he bear the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. &gt;&gt; Wow. That's Genesis to Revelations right there, brothers. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day. We thank you for your blessings. We thank you for the word that we've just read and the story that's told in Isaiah 53 of a loving, perfect savior, a loving God who found uh it found it pleasing to save the entire world through the suffering of his own son. Lord, how humble we should be, how meek, how lowly we should be, how thankful, Lord, and help us to never take for granted what was done for us or that perfection that was given for us, Lord. We just want to ask, Lord, that you just be with us tonight as we minister the word. Open our hearts to receive that we would just get closer to you. And if there's somebody that needs healing tonight, may there be healing in the word. If somebody needs deliverance, may there be deliverance in the word tonight. If somebody just needs a closer walk with you and a and a filling of the Holy Ghost, may they find a closer walk with you and a filling of the Holy Ghost and it's in your precious name we ask these things in the lovely name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can have your seats. I want to speak tonight if we could on identified by the message of your hour. Identified by the message of your hour. So, a few services ago, we we begin to preach and we were talking and we were talking about diamonds and we were talking about how the diamonds were made and and we we were talking there and I got to looking and thinking about these diamonds some more. And as I got to thinking, I seen where brother Brandon was talking about the diamonds. He was at the Kimberly Mines in South Africa, I think. And he said there was just a big old pile of priceless diamonds there. He said, "But there was no sparkle in them whatsoever." So he asked the guy, "Why why are these so valuable when there's no sparkle?" He said, "Well, the thing is they're valuable, but they just haven't been cut yet." &gt;&gt; And you know, we talked ABOUT THAT CUTTING THOSE DIAMONDS. BY CUTTING THEM, you find out what the brilliance is on the inside. And when we were preaching that service, I made a statement at the end of that service and I said that perfect became imperfect so that imperfect could become perfect. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I said that at the end of that, I didn't have it in my notes and I didn't have it written down. I never I hadn't really even thought about it, but when I said it, it stuck with me and it stuck with me. And I over the next few days, I began to think about that statement over and over and over. And I couldn't get that simple little statement out out of my head or off of my mind. And so I I I I begin to get in preparation for these services coming up this this weekend with brother Jesse's. And and as I begin to think about that service and and thinking about this service, I was trying to find the direction and the leadership of the Lord, which way are we going to go? And because we want to make sure we're in tune with God. We want to make sure when we go before the people that we're delivering what God would have for the people. And so I began to sit there and I began to pray. And a and I went to sleep that night or one night and I woke up the next morning and the first thing that popped into my mind when my eyes opened was the word identified. It wasn't like good morning. It wasn't like hello Lord. It wasn't like did you sleep good honey? Identified. And so I I I began to think about it and I thought, Lord, identified. What What do you mean identified? What? You got to You got to give me some more. I can't just I can't just go off identified. What is it? And and then as I as I got ready to get up, I thought identified. He said, "Identified by the message of your hour." AND IT STUCK WITH ME SO MUCH. I GOT UP immediately and I went straight to my whiteboard. I got three or four big whiteboards in my study. And I just got the marker and I said, "Identify by the message of your hour." Because I didn't want to forget because I don't have those kinds of experiences a lot when I wake up and identified and I didn't want to forget. SO I I GOT THERE AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT and then all of a sudden Isaiah 53 begins to come into my mind. And so I began to ponder these thoughts and and I came across the message, the identified masterpiece of God. And lo and behold, as I began to read and listen and and and get into that message, what scripture do you think was brother Brandham used in that message? Isaiah 53. And now he preached messages before on identification, identified. He preached on the masterpiece. He preached on all these. But this is the one time that I can think and I can find that he preached the identified masterpiece of God. And and looking at this, the prophet begins to talk and he's telling he says God has been making him a masterpiece. And he said because he he struck he struck Adam to get a piece off of off of him off of a part of him and got a rib to make for him a wife. So we can see right here in the very beginning in the garden of Eden, God goes down and he says Adam needs a helpmate. &gt;&gt; So this is in the mind OF CHRIST AS GOD IS TRYING TO PROCESS HIS OWN THOUGHTS into manifestations on earth. So he says, "YOU KNOW WHAT? ADAM NEEDS A HELPMATE. SO, I'M GOING TO GO AND I'M GOING TO PULL SOMETHING OUT OF MY original creation &gt;&gt; and I'm going to make him a bride. &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet makes it very clear as we go into the message that she was a byproduct. Adam couldn't fall. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She was a byproduct of what Adam was. She was a part of that original creation. And so, God pulls her out of there. And the prophet says what he has done. He took and he put the masterpiece and struck him ON CALVARY. NOW he's at we're in THE GARDEN OF EDEN. NOW WE'RE at Calvary. And he said he put that masterpiece and struck him on Calvary and he got a piece of him. &gt;&gt; Adam's ribs. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; JESUS ON CALVARY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the correlation here? And so here he says he's up on Calvary. HE SAYS, "BUT NOW WHAT IT IS, IT'S THE NEW TESTAMENT. ANOTHER piece being fulfilled." &gt;&gt; You see, it didn't just stop AT CALVARY. THERE'S MORE to the story. &gt;&gt; There's more to WHY HE WAS SMITTEN. There is more to WHY HE WAS MOCKED. THERE IS MORE TO WHY HE WAS HE was bruised and and smitten on the cross. It was because he was trying to get a bride. Oh, come on, church. You can do better than that. IT'S BECAUSE HE WAS THE REASON JESUS WENT TO CALVARY AND WAS SMITTEN IN THE SIDE WAS BECAUSE GOD WAS TRYING TO TAKE SOMETHING THAT WAS CREATED PERFECT AND PULL OUT OF HIM A BRIDE THAT WOULD BE PERFECT in this last hour. And he said he he took that old he took the old to foreshadow or foreshadow the new. He said Christ became the masterpiece to fulfill that. Now, his bride will fulfill, listen, his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You either want to get on this bus or you don't. &gt;&gt; But this bus is going to do some things. This bus is going places. He says it's another masterpiece in the making. It's taken him 4,000 years to make this masterpiece. 2,000 years of making another masterpiece, a bride for Christ. Another masterpiece. And in doing it, he says he does it by his neverchanging method. THE same way he made the masterpiece, by his word. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; By his word. That's the way he makes his masterpiece because he can only be a perfect masterpiece when it's the perfect word. So, in the beginning, God says, "Let there be light. Let there be fishes. Let there be fouls of the air. Let there be trees. LET THERE BE PLANTS. NOW LET US MAKE MAN in our image, &gt;&gt; the spoken word. &gt;&gt; And at the end when Jesus goes to the cross or when he's on the face of the earth, we should say, what did he live by? The word. It is written. WHEN SATAN COME TO HIM, WHAT DID HE SAY? IT IS WRITTEN. &gt;&gt; I SH THOU SHALT NOT. It is written. What if you do this? It's written. AND CONSTANTLY JESUS WAS TAKING them through the parables and through the life as he was living his life. He was taking them through a journey down through the word from Genesis to Revelation. So we see that the word is so important to us tonight. The word to the believer is one of the most important things that you can grasp a hold of. the word I BECAUSE IT IDENTIFIES you with Christ. &gt;&gt; The word identifies you with Christ. And the word, the living word, is what makes us his masterpiece. It's when THE WORD COMES IN ON THE INSIDE OF US AND SETS DOWN AND TAKES A HOLD DOWN DEEP down inside of this heart that once was stony, once was hard, but now has been softened by the Holy Ghost and through the word of God, through the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now we got to we're now we're living the word. His masterpiece says that he'll be without spot. She'll be without spot or wrinkle. &gt;&gt; That's by the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, when you're identified, that word identified, it means establish or it indicates who or what someone or something is. So, let's ask ourselves tonight, who are you? Who am I? Who are we? Who are we? WHAT ARE WE IDENTIFIED WITH? When people look at us out ON THE STREET, WHAT DO THEY SAY? THAT PERSON is well, we hope they're saying Christian. &gt;&gt; We hope they're saying it. That person has the Holy Ghost. That person is honest. THAT PERSON IS LOVING. THAT PERSON IS KIND. THAT PERSON is caring. You see, because all those are identifications and attributes of Jesus Christ. So as we go out, WE HOPE THAT we're being identified that way because when we are identified, it means that you re you are recognized and distinguished by somebody that is worthy of attention. So when you walk down the street and they begin to look at these attributes of your life, love, peace, joy, longsuffering, honesty, caring, kind, giving, loving. They begin to look at that. Brothers and sisters, WHAT THAT IS SAYING, IT SAYS THAT GOD IN THIS DAY IS worthy of attention. HE IS WORTHY OF ATTENTION. SO THE SIGNS and the wonders AND THE MIRACLE THAT ARE TAKING PLACE IN the bride of Christ around the world, they are worthy of attention. They are worthy of attention because it identifies that the bride of Jesus Christ in this hour is following the word. Let me tell you tonight, when we see cancers being healed, &gt;&gt; when we see when we see the lost being saved, &gt;&gt; when we see our weward loved ones to begin TO COME BACK AND GET back into the fold and back into the word, when we see sight that has been restored, &gt;&gt; you say, "I'd never seen that." How many of you ever seen Brother Ron Spencer? Do you know his testimony about his eyes? &gt;&gt; THE DOCTOR SAID, "YOU GOT cancer in your eyes, Ron. You got cancer in your eyes and IT'S SO BAD. WE'RE GOING TO have to remove your eyeballs." How many's heard his testimony? &gt;&gt; And they begin to pray. And he went to doctor after doctor after doctor and every one of them said the same, "Cancer, we're going to have to remove. Cancer, we're going to have to remove. Cancer, we're going to have to remove." until he goes to this last doctor and him and sister Connie, he said they walked down the hall and they got together and they joined hands and they began to pray, "God, I don't want to lose my eyes." Lord, he said he went in to see that doctor and doctor said, "I'll see you in six months." He said, 'Doc, I've been told I got cancer in my eyes and I'm here to get my eyes removed. Are you sure you're looking at the right case? He said, there's been some kind of mistake. You don't have no cancer IN YOUR EYES. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE NO CANCER IN YOUR EYES. THAT'S GOD MOVING. AND BUT WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE WE ARE IDENTIFIED WITH A MIRACLE WORKING, WONDERWORKING GOD THAT HEALS THE DISEASE of his people. When we see this HAPPEN IN PLACE, WE SEE YOUNG PEOPLE BEING filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; ACTS OF THE HOLY GHOST LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN YEARS. &gt;&gt; Some of us have testimonies we need to share. &gt;&gt; You know who you are. &gt;&gt; But this identifies us. This identifies our God in the message that was delivered in this hour. Brothers and sisters, it tells THE WHOLE WORLD THAT THE MESSAGE OF THIS HOUR is alive and well. AND HE HEARS HIS PEOPLE. YOUR CRIES DO NOT GO UNHEARD. THEY DON'T FALL ON DEAF EARS BECAUSE WHY? HE HEARS his people. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT TUCKED AWAY in some stony cave somewhere in a tomb, rolled up in a in a lo in a linen cloth. EVERY OTHER GOD, EVERY other little G god is out there somewhere in a tomb this night. &gt;&gt; BUT NOT MY GOD. &gt;&gt; NOT MY GOD. MY GOD IS NOT IN A TOMB TONIGHT. HE'S LIVING IN THE HEART OF ME. HE'S LIVING IN THE HEART OF YOU. THAT'S WHERE our God is. HE'S SITTING ON A THRONE AND he's delivering to his people. He's not tucked away. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, SHE BECOMES HIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We've sang that song for years. He became me that I might become him through grace. Do you do we did we even realize what we were saying? Do we even realize what we were saying all those years? She becomes him. When that side was smitten, when that side was smitten on Calvary, and that blood be to pour out onto the ground of Calvary, you know what that BLOOD DID? THAT BLOOD begin to cover a multitude. That blood be to cover a multitude of sin. That blood BEGIN TO COVER A multitude of wrongdoings. That blood begin to cover a a MULTITUDE OF FILTHY THOUGHTS. THAT BLOOD BEGIN to to cover a multitude of filthy habits. &gt;&gt; What a what a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; What a masterpiece. So much that John says it this way. John 14:12, "Verily, verily, I say unto you that he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall you do also. greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father. He's telling them, I'm leaving. I'm fixing to leave out of here. And whatsoever you ask of my name, that will I do, that my father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it. If you love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the Father that he shall give you another comforter. Who was the comforter? &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS THE COMFORTER. EVERYWHERE HE WENT, he comforted the people. EVERYWHERE HE WENT, there was a presence ABOUT HIM. HE SAID, "BUT IF I LEAVE, DON'T WORRY. DON'T PANIC. DON'T FRET, LITTLE LITTLE CHURCH. I'm going to send you another comforter. &gt;&gt; And this COMFORTER MAY B ABIDE WITH you forever. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, IS HERE IN THIS HOUR TO ABIDE WITH US FOREVER. Even the spirit of truth whom the the world cannot receive. Because ye seeth him not, it seeth him not, neither knoweth him. But ye KNOW HIM. HOW MANY KNOWS him tonight? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOWS HIM AS REDEEMER? HOW MANY KNOWS HIM AS HEALER? HOW MANY KNOWS HIM AS DELIVERER? YOU KNOW HIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; For he dwelleth with you and shall be &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Give the Lord a hand. Let me catch my breath. Hallelujah. You see, when you identify with someone, you become what's called an associate. You're an associate with them. You're an associate with Jesus Christ. YOU'RE AN ASSOCIATE WITH JESUS CHRIST ON THE BASIS OF THE BLOOD THAT WAS SHED ON CALVARY THAT YOU HAVE NOW BEEN redeemed as though you never &gt;&gt; done it. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people cringe when you say that. Oh, look at you smiling. Some of you say, "Whoa, what? That's big." Let me read you what the prophet said. How many believes the words of the prophet? &gt;&gt; We in agreeance where two or three are in agreeance. God looking through the blood. He doesn't see you no more as a sinner. He sees you redeemed. You're redeemed because he always sees you through Christ. That's the reason we can be perfect. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Woo. That's that's rich. That's the reason we can BE PERFECT. NOT PERFECT IN the sense of sinners. We're perfection in the eyes of God when we're in Christ. &gt;&gt; So what you identify with in this hour says a lot about who you are. What you identify with lets people know what you think. You know, brother Brandham said, "You show me what you got in your living room, what's on your coffee table, whatever. I can tell you what kind of, you know, let me tell me who you hanging out with. I can tell you what kind of person you are. So, what you identify with, what you associate with is going to tell the people a lot about how you're going to act. It's going to tell the people a lot about how you're going to treat other people that you come in contact with. It's going to tell the people a lot of stuff. So that's why our confession is so important because it's based upon our confession of the blood of Jesus Christ and the association and the identification of living underneath that blood of Calvary. Listen to this. You'll never live above your confession. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the high priest of our confession. He can't do nothing until you first confess he's done it. &gt;&gt; If you need healing, but you don't think he's a healer and you can't confess he's a healer, you ain't getting healed. &gt;&gt; But if you confess it and you begin to associate with it and you begin to accept it, that's when God moves ON THE SCENE. HE SAYS, HE SAYS, "I'M NOT SAVED TONIGHT BECAUSE I get happy and shout." No, that isn't it. I'm not saved because of the gift of God works through me. No, I'm saved because I have met the conditions that Jesus Christ required of me. He says, I'm saved ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE AND NOT BECAUSE I feel like I'm saved. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we want to feel like we're saved, but we're not associating around the right crowd. Brother Ber, &gt;&gt; people want to come to church AND SAY, "OH, I GO TO CHURCH HERE. I'M A CHRISTIAN." BUT THEY ASSOCIATE A WRONG AROUND the wrong crowds of people. &gt;&gt; Show me who you associate with, I'll tell you what kind of life you're living. &gt;&gt; It's that simple. &gt;&gt; You know the old saying, if you if you lay with dogs, you're going to get fleas. &gt;&gt; You write that one down, Lauren. She writes down all my sayings because I got a million of them. She ain't never heard some Miss Kentucky lingo. we use. Listen now. Not because I feel like I'm saved. He says because Satan can whip you around the stump on your feelings. &gt;&gt; If you say, "Well, I'm I'm saved today. I feel good. I did you did you experience a joy in the service we had today?" Did you Have you ever been in such a service and then the next day Satan knocks you in the dirt? Well, I just don't know if I'm saved. IT'S NOT BASED UPON THOSE FEELINGS, BUT IT'S BASED, HE SAID, UPON THUS SAYAETH THE LORD. I'M SAVED. I'M GOING TO CONFESS THAT. I'M GOING TO believe I'm saved. Sitting here in my seat, I'm going to accept it. I'm going to begin to confess it. And I'm going to tell people I'm saved. &gt;&gt; How many we haven't saved? Say it. I'm saved. &gt;&gt; I'm saved. &gt;&gt; I never doubted you, but others might. He said, "See, the people said, there ain't no difference in you. Young people, you battle this a lot, and I know it. You come and you you feel like you get something from God. You feel like you're getting saved. You feel like, you know, the Holy Ghost. You're getting filled with the Holy Ghost." But people will look at you say, "N I don't see I don't see nothing. It's not about that. It's not about that. He said, "Keep your confession and watch it work righteousness." You keep saying, "I'm saved all of your neighbors and everybody will know you're saved because you believed it. YOU CONFESSED IT." WHY? WHAT HAPPENED? It changed you. HE'S THE HIGH PRIEST OF your confession, sitting at the right hand of the father, making good on WHAT YOU'RE CONFESSING. SO IF YOU SAY, "I GOT THE HOLY GHOST," you're going to start living like you got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I'm healed. YOU'RE GOING TO START ACTING like you're healed. &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says. The same thing is about healing. You accept him as your healer. Renounce your feelings. You know, there's days when you're sick, and I'm talking big sick, cancers, heart issues, diabetes, lung issues. These issues are real &gt;&gt; and they give you real real uh symptoms and your body begins to feel these symptoms. He said, "BUT YOU RENOUNCE THOSE FEELINGS. You don't tell people, "I don't feel good today." You renounce those feelings because it's by your faith. He says, "Say you're healed. &gt;&gt; Believe you're healed. &gt;&gt; Act like you're healed. &gt;&gt; Now watch. associate with those who believe in healing. &gt;&gt; We got to have we got to have some faith built around us. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO HAVE SOME SOMETHING THAT LIFTS us up and makes us helps us to believe. When you have a hard time believing, I need people that can help believe for me. &gt;&gt; When the symptoms are more than I can bear, Brother Baller, I NEED YOU TO SAY, "YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. &gt;&gt; GOD CAN HEAL YOU. GOD'S GOING TO HEAL YOU. I BELIEVE for you, he said. And you get around those people and associate with those who believe in healing and God will bring you right out to a perfect soundness of health. &gt;&gt; And he punctuates it with it will not fail. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You see how important it is of what we associate You see, it goes both ways. Oh, you got to have the negative. If you're going to have the positive, you got to have the negative. If you're going to have the good, you got to have the bad. I'm sorry. That's just the way it works. That's the way preaching works. That's the way life works. You see, if you identify with sin and unbelief, if you find yourself identifying and associating with sin and unbelief, you're going to act like a sinner. You see, because unbelief will lead you down the road of alcoholism, &gt;&gt; drug addiction, &gt;&gt; tobacco abuse, &gt;&gt; pornography. That's right. It'll lead you down all these roads. It'll ruin your marriage. Unbelief will lead you to adultery and fornication. Unbelief, associating with the wrong crowd. Why is that? Because you're associating with the wrong spirit. He says, "What's the condition that the world's gotten into?" He said they got out here on the street and carry on and they stick their head in a television on Wednesday night and don't go to church. We running about twothird the numbers we are on Sundays. Brother Bo, tell me where they at. They won't go to church. Why? Listen now. But there ain't a kid in the country who don't know everything there is to know about Davy Crockett. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You heard this quote before, had you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he says, "We tell him everything there is. We tell him a dirty lie saying he killed a bear at three years old. You know that's a lie." He said, "YOU KNOW IT'S A LIE." HE SAYS, "BUT YOU LET YOUR KIDS get their head all stuffed full of that." But yet there is isn't 1% of 100 that ever know anything about Jesus. Now I got to thinking about this and I thought, you know what, we live in the Bible belt. We live in a in a in a in an area in the country when there's a church on every corner, some across the street from each other. And as one woman said, sometimes they even named the same. So to say our kids have not heard or the kids in this in this area have not heard of Jesus Christ is probably probably a far shot. But I've come to find out that the truth is that there are numerous people around the world and in the United States in our country that have never heard or don't even care to know a thing about Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They don't want to know. I seen this clip. This YouTuber, all he does is go around and ask people, "Do they know Jesus?" &gt;&gt; "Do you know Jesus?" Leave me alone. "Do you know Jesus?" I don't want to talk about it. "Do you know Jesus?" You shouldn't ask me that. "Do you know Jesus?" You're too political. Over and over and OVER AND OVER, ONE AFTER ANOTHER AFTER another after another after another until one of them said, "Yes, I know Jesus." John 3:16. And he began to quote it. AND I THOUGHT ONE OUT OF HOW MANY DID HE HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO GET TO ONE PERSON? They don't want to associate around it. AND THE PROPHET SAID IS BECAUSE THIS WORLD HAS become so polluted. This world is associated with Satan. It's associated with selfishness. It's associated with meanness &gt;&gt; and hate &gt;&gt; and envy and entitlement. That's what the world is associating with in this hour we're living in. &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANYBODY but themselves. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN I BENEFIT? Don't ask me about Jesus. This world has become SO POLLUTED. THIS NATION SO RIDICULOUS and so FAR FROM GOD THAT THEY HAVE REJECTED THE Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You say, "I go to church. I shout." You might do that. But until that gentle lamb of God settles down into your heart and cleans up your life and makes you act like a different person, it won't do you no good to impersonate Christ. &gt;&gt; I want you to listen to this quote. I I I apologize if I if I got too many quotes tonight, but I hope you're enjoying it because these quotes really bless my heart. He's talking about the Isuza Street meetings and we know that and in the Isuza Street meetings, the the Holy Ghost fell and it was the found it was the the birth of Pentecostals and and the Pentecostalism, but not the Pentecost that we know of today. Not the Pentecostal movement that we see all over YouTube and the dancing and shouting and and 40,000 women on the stage all having a microphone singing and dancing. That's not what it was talking about. But the Isuza Street meetings when the Holy Ghost fell, he said those people got together. And when Christ come down amongst those people, I want you to watch the character that was in those people. HE SAID THEY WERE GENTLE. They were peaceful. They lived godly lives. They lived sacrificial lives. They were willing to give in. They were willing to be led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You see, so many times we surround oursel with churchism. &gt;&gt; Churchism. &gt;&gt; I go here, I go there. This is my pastor. That's my pastor. And I go here, and I give here, and I gave that, and I did this. Churchism. And all along are they sitting there with just being a part of the system or are they a part of the movement? &gt;&gt; I want TO BE A PART OF THE MOVEMENT. I WANT TO BE A PART OF JESUS CHRIST MOVING IN MY LIFE, MOVING IN YOUR LIFE, IN MY CHILDREN'S LIFE, IN THE CHURCH'S LIFE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT we're looking for. &gt;&gt; They didn't care if people called them crazy. They didn't care if people called them old-fashioned. They didn't CARE WHAT CAME THEIR WAY, BUT THEY WERE WILLING TO be led by the Holy Ghost. He said, "But now watch these powder puffs." Uh-oh. Remember I said there's a good and a bad. There's a Watch these powderpuff makeup box short on in the street. What a disgrace. He said, 'WHEN THEY CALL themselves with the Holy Ghost. Have you ever noticed that they call themselves with I I got anointed with the Holy Ghost. He says, "Why? It's such a disgrace." You say, "But I spoke in tongues." Yes. And the devil does, TOO. &gt;&gt; I SHOUTED. YES. And the devil does, too. The devil can impersonate everything that God's got except love. SO HERE NOW WE SEE WE GET TO WATCHING out here what's going on out in the world. And they're constantly I got the Holy Ghost. I got this. I got the Holy Ghost. I got the Holy Ghost. And the next thing you know, we see worship like you can't imagine. First thing you know, listen now, this is not this is not I'm not harping at you, but I'm just I'm just showing you how how quick things can go south. First thing you know, you get started doing these things and you've let down the bars. You begin to compromise. You begin to compromise. How many don't show your hands, but think in your mind. How many has ever compromised around the word? I could be honest and say I probably have more than once. I what if I what if this? What if? Maybe it don't. Maybe it does. You know what I'm talking about? So, we can't be compromisers. We have to find ourselves filled with the Holy Ghost to where the compromise is taken out. He says, "But they begin to compromise and then the church," watch how this just pollutes all based on compromising on the word. They compromise and the next thing you know, you get little clicks amongst them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you get these little clicks amongst you. And this one will say, "Pastor did this. Deacons done this." &gt;&gt; First thing you know, because you're in a compromised state, because you're in a compromised state, first thing you know, you listen to that What we need is people to stand up and say, "I don't know who you're talking about, but you're not going to be talking about my pastor that way." &gt;&gt; If you've got a problem, you need to go see him. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me. Don't tell nobody else. If you've got an issue, you go talk to him about the issue. That's free. He says, "You've listened to that and you find yourself, you get into so much trouble because you begin to listen to that devil and you get a snarl instead of the dove Holy Spirit, the dove of God that would lead you and guide you and love you and bless you." Huh? First time. Listen now, brothers and sisters. Hey, we we beating rubbers meeting road tonight. THE FIRST TIME you get one of them little temper spasms, &gt;&gt; you know what happens? &gt;&gt; The dove flies away. &gt;&gt; That's right. She can't stand it. She can't stand it. Her nature is different. &gt;&gt; Oh, she can't stand it at all. AND YOU GO TO TALKING ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBOR, she can't stand it. &gt;&gt; She just won't put up with it. &gt;&gt; Help us, LORD. &gt;&gt; HELP ME, LORD. HELP US, LORD. How many would say that? Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; THAT WE DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THESE SITUATIONS BECAUSE WE FOUND OURSELVES IN a in a state of compromise. He just can't stand it any longer and he takes his flight because that dove is gentle. The dove is meek. The dove can't stand nothing unless it's the same kind of nature. Why is that? He was smitten. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That nature was pulled out and given to you as a gift under the shed blood of Calvary, but we want to get all wolf nature. Let me tell you, if they sing that song again, if he PREACHES ONE MORE TIME LIKE THAT, if that deacon EVER CORRECTS MY CHILD LIKE THAT AGAIN, hair standing up, bristled up, fangs out, claws out. Hi. You say, "Well, I'm not that bad." Well, maybe you're just a goat. Always butting against everything. &gt;&gt; I don't like this. I'm going to butt against it. I'm going to butt against it. But you see, God, you say, you say, "How can how can I, if I've got this nature, how do I overcome this nature? How do I overcome?" BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT we're here for. We're here to overcome our problems. We're here to overcome these negative things. We're here to overcome that wolf nature, that goat nature. THAT IS OUR DESIRE TO GET THAT GENTLE, SWEET, meek dove, lamb nature. How do I do it? How do I do it, brother Brandham? He said, God can make you a different man and a different woman by nature. He can give you a DIFFERENT NATURE. WELL, BROTHER BRANDHAM, WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT? OH, all ears. &gt;&gt; Now, this is pretty deep and pretty difficult. So, you listen. &gt;&gt; What can we do about it? Just become a lamb again. Just become a lamb again. Just take another trip to Calvary. Just take another trip under the shed blood of Calvary. Get yourself under that under that BLOOD AND CONFESS, LORD, I'M NOT WHAT I WANT TO BE. LORD, THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF NATURE that I want IN MY LIFE. LORD, I WANT TO BE LIKE YOU, NOT LIKE THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; Find yourself under Calvary. He said, "And if you are a become a goat," now he ain't talking about the greatest of all time. Not that kind of goat. Not the Michael Jordan kind of goat. But if you find yourself are becoming a goat, then get that old goaty spirit off of you. &gt;&gt; You know, it's it's it's it's it's this is I want you to remember it this way. It's miserable being miserable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's miserable to be miserable. THAT EVERY TIME SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING OR THE CHURCH DOES THIS OR DOES THAT, YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO R UP AGAINST. BROTHER, I don't know why we're going this way, but &gt;&gt; get that goat nature out. It's important what we identify with. Let's get off of that. You know, if you're a woman, you identify as a woman, you act like a woman. If you identify as a man, you'll act like a man. I think we all here got that right. The world's got it backwards. We have men who identify as women. And what do they act like? &gt;&gt; Sissies. We got women who IDENTIFY AS MEN. WHAT DO THEY act like? &gt;&gt; They swell up like a I don't I'm thinking just let's just move on. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU IDENTIFY AS AN OUTLAW, YOU'RE GOING TO BE A LAWB BREAKER. BUT PRAISE BE TO GOD. IF YOU IDENTIFY AS A CHRISTIAN, YOU'RE GOING TO ACT LIKE CHRIST ACTED. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. AND IT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER. OH, brother brother Brandham tells he said, "Oh, I went to the library when I was about 12 years old." And he said, "I got a book there and it was called The Lone Ranger." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I RODE MY MAMA'S broom handle. I rode my mama's broom handle to death. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thinking I was the Lone Ranger. &gt;&gt; He said, "Then I went back and I got a book called Tarzan and the Apes." &gt;&gt; He said, "I took my mama's rug that was in front of the stove, I think he said." And he said, "I cut that thing up, made him a I guess a loin cloth, and he said, "I slept in the trees because I was Tarzan." Y'all laugh because y'all done the same thing. I was a rrestler. I was Conan the barbarian. I was you name it. I had a sword. I slept up in the trees. He said, "But one day, one day," HE SAID, "ONE DAY I GOT A HOLD OF SOMETHING THAT WAS REAL. ONE DAY I GOT A HOLD OF SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT FAKE, THAT WAS NOT NOT FICTION, BUT IT WAS TRUTH." AND HE SAID, "THAT ONE DAY, IT WAS JESUS CHRIST THAT I FOUND WAS REAL. And that Jesus Christ could do real THINGS IN MY LIFE. AND I HAVE ONLY WANTED TO BE WHAT JESUS WANTED ME TO BE. I'M GOING TO ACT like Jesus. You see, when the Holy Ghost on the inside, when you get the Holy Ghost on the inside, it identifies back to the life of Christ and and you begin to act like the real Holy Ghost fil son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; There ain't no put on. &gt;&gt; That's right. But when that Holy Ghost is on the inside and you begin to identify yourself upon your confession that I'm a believer, you're going to do what believers do. &gt;&gt; You're going to act like believers act. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE FAITH LIKE BELIEVERS HAVE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK THE WORD LIKE BELIEVERS SPEAK. YOU'RE GOING TO QUOTE THE QUOTES THE WAY BELIEVERS QUOTE THE QUOTES. YOU GOING to be everything that the believer would ever be. &gt;&gt; We got a term that we hear a lot. It's called guilty by association. Guilty by association. You know, we we underestimate a lot of time and we discredit who we really are. And we allow Satan to whisper in our ears, "You're not a believer. You're not good enough. Look at everybody else. Look how much better they are. You don't see them in their house. You don't see them in their car. Quit looking at people and look to Christ. &gt;&gt; Look to Christ. Guilty by association. We underestimate. You know, a lot of times as ministers, brother Balor, myself, other ministers, we get asked questions a lot. We get asked personal private questions. And one of the things that I get asked a lot or or it comes up is that people will say, "I want the Holy Ghost, but I have these thoughts." How can I have the Holy Ghost when these thoughts come up? How can I have the Holy Ghost? I'M TRYING TO DO GOOD. HOW CAN I HAVE the Holy Ghost when when I have a desire that rises up in my life? Everybody take your right hand. Grab yourself right here. Now squeeze. That's called flesh. &gt;&gt; That's called flesh. &gt;&gt; You see, your flesh is not perfect. &gt;&gt; Your flesh is not going to be perfect. We're still IN THESE EARTHLY BODIES. WE STILL HAVE TO OVERCOME DAY AFTER DAY after day &gt;&gt; the temptations and the thoughts that come through our mind. Why do you think the PROPHET PREACHED THE GREATEST BATTLE EVER fought was where? Here. &gt;&gt; He didn't say the greatest battle ever fought was in the heart. &gt;&gt; No. Why? Because once you get under THE BLOOD OF CALVARY AND YOU GET SEALED AWAY, they nothing going to PENETRATE THAT HEART. &gt;&gt; YOU may have thoughts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You may have desires. You may say, "How in the world? How could this be ple how could I ever be pleasing to God with the kind of thoughts I have going on in my mind?" But listen to guilty by association. I want you to listen to this definition. It's the idea that a person is to blame for a crime or wrongdoing based solely on their connection to someone who's guilty. I may have had a thought to cheat somebody, but I didn't do it. Satan's the cheater. &gt;&gt; I may have had a thought to lie about something, but I didn't do it. Satan's a liar. &gt;&gt; Now, under years and years ago, you would have been guilty by association. You thought the thought, you you envisioned a thought. Maybe maybe he's telling you to look at stuff you shouldn't look at. You didn't do it. He He's the pervert. But thank the Lord that the Supreme Court says legally, listen to this, a person is not guilty simply because they are associated with a criminal. If Satan comes knocking on your door, we know him. Don't you know him? I know him. &gt;&gt; I don't want to know him. I don't like him. I don't like him when he comes knocking. But, you know, from time to time, he knocks on my door. Why we get quiet when we talk about this? We're human beings, people. &gt;&gt; Let's be real. &gt;&gt; HE KNOCKS ON MY DOOR. He knocks on your door. He knocks on everybody's door in here with some kind of thought, TEMPTATION, OR DESIRE THAT YOU WISH YOU never had. &gt;&gt; But you're not the guilty one. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE GUILTY ONE. HE'S THE ONE THAT CARRIED OUT THE ACT. HE'S THE ONE THAT WENT THROUGH WITH IT ON the in heaven on that day and when when thirds of an angel come down and fell with him. HE'S THE GUILTY ONE. BUT I'M NOT GUILTY because the blood says &gt;&gt; YOU'RE REDEEMED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE it in the first place. Brother Brandham says, "I'm gonna have to hurry now. We got a great a great day of typology." Typology. I like those words he comes up with. If you don't believe it, paint your steps red next week and watch week after next. Your neighbors ain't got their steps painted red. He said, "Go to church with a new kind of hat on." I like this because he talks he talks my my kind of language. No matter how freaky it looks, the neighbor next to you don't try to get the same kind of hat and say, "Where'd you get that at?" No matter what it looks like. Where'd you get that at? He said, "If you if you drive a Plymouth after you've been driving a Ford, watch and see. Your neighbor don't want a Plymouth. man, they want something to match one another. And they said, I ALWAYS SAID I DIDN'T CARE IF MY TROUSERS MATCH my coat and my coat match my tie. But what I do want is my experience to match the word OF GOD AND WHAT GOD SAYS. That's why I SAY QUIT LOOKING AT OTHER PEOPLE. LOOK TO CALVARY. He said, ' If those people on the day of Pentecost got the Holy Ghost and they staggered and they shouted and he said they went out into the streets and they done miracles and and they acted like A BUNCH OF MANIACS, that's the kind of experience I want. You say, "Well, that scares me. I don't know if I want to act that way. I just want to do what he asked me to do." Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes God, in order to be in the will of God, the perfect will of God, sometimes you have to get your out of your comfort zone, &gt;&gt; you have to get the get the the the the pain and the the fear of what your flesh feels out of the way. Brother Brandham's talking about he goes into he goes down into Los Angeles and he said this was the first time he ever got in in came in contact with the Pentecostal people out in California. And he said they wanted to tour him around and they wanted to take him to go see the the the burial place or the the place where Amy Simp S simple McFersonson was was buried. And so they take him out there and he said he's walking around. He's looking. He play paid his respect to to her in this uh morg or whatever whatever we would call it. I don't know it's not a morg but a a memorial area I guess. And he said as he walked through there he said one of the most outstanding things he saw when he entered on the east side of that door was a statue of Moses. And he said there was a statue of Moses right there. And he said it was told the guide told me that it was the the capstone. It was the cap of Michelangelo's life's work was when he carved out the image of Moses and it was the greatest masterpiece that Michelangelo had ever made. He said, "But then I noticed, I believe it was on the right knee." He said, "That statue looked perfect. That statue looked perfect. It was smooth." And and there stood Moses with the tables of laws in his arms. And he said what it was. He was standing there with the laws in his hands and his long beard. Now this was the mental conception of Michelangelo. He said Michelangelo didn't have a picture to go off of. He didn't have none of that. He was only going off what his mind told him that Moses would have looked like. &gt;&gt; He said, "And as the story goes and the statue got finished, it was rubbed all perfectly and smooth. And Michelangelo stands back at it. Come on. You gonna set up front. You gonna get you gonna participate, right? So, you're a statue. &gt;&gt; Give me your tablets. All right. So, now Michelangelo, can you imagine him walking around looking at this image of perfection? He's looking at this image of perfection. It's smooth and he's just taking it all in. Look at this. Perfection. Perfection. And he's walking around looking over and over, checking it out. It's absolutely perfect. And he gets so inspired. He gets so inspired that what the very thought of his mind of what perfection was. He's so inspired that he looks AND HE THINKS BANG SPEAK. You can have your seat. It was such a perfect image in his mind that HE HE THOUGHT THIS THING OUGHT TO BE IT'S SO PERFECT IT SPEAK to us. So he hits it AND KNOCKS A CHIP off of the right knee &gt;&gt; with the hammer. He smoteed it. Moses was now smitten by Michelangelo with a hammer because he was so inspired by the perfection that he saw. I hope you're picking up what I'm putting down. There was something on the inside of him. He said there was something on the inside of him at the beginning. HE DREW A MENTAL PICTURE IN his mind of what he thought Moses should look like. And now after all this time, years and years and years, he could see that the thought that HE HAD IN HIS MIND BEGIN TO reflect before him. Exactly what he had seen years and years and years before. &gt;&gt; He seen the reflection. And he says, brother Brown says, ' And I got so inspired. I GOT SO INSPIRED BY THAT BECAUSE I THOUGHT that the reality of it was the mark on the leg is what made it to me the masterpiece. Speak. That was the masterpiece because brother Brandham began to see and he be to take and he be to put it in perspective of what HE COULD SEE THAT DOWN THROUGH TIME mo here was Moses down through time Moses is standing there with the tablets perfect but he was smitten. And when we begin TO SEE WHAT GOD HAD DONE WITH JESUS in our day, HE PUTS JESUS UP THERE AND HE BEGINS to look at him and he begins to look at the life that Jesus had be down through time all from the days he was on the face of the earth and he says, "This man is perfect. &gt;&gt; There is not a flaw in his life. He's never done wrong. He's never said a bad word. He's never had a bad thought. He's never said said anything about anybody. Are you with me? Jesus is perfect down through time because we look and we see that down through time Moses failed. &gt;&gt; Abraham failed. &gt;&gt; David &gt;&gt; failed and failed miserably. &gt;&gt; They failed at perfection. But now Jesus comes. NOW JESUS CAME TO REFLECT the father. He said and the father was the word. He said he came to reflect the father's WORD. AND HE GOD SAID he would be there. And there he was. The perfect masterpiece of God. THE MASTERPIECE of God. His very handiwork from the days of the Garden of Eden. He reflected. Listen to what he says. Oh my. He reflected everything that God had spoke of. In the beginning, God said, "Let there be light. Let there be fouls of the air. Let there be fish of the sea. Let there be a firmament." What was the what was he trying to get? Now let us make man in our image. He reflected what Adam said about him. He reflected all what all the prophets said about him. He reflected what all the patriarchs said about him. Everything he said, he was the fulfillment of the word and all types was fulfilled in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; As Jesus comes on the scene in the New Testament, everybody up to that point fail, fail, fail, fail. And as Jesus comes into the Old Testament, watch what he says. He said HE WAS THE OLD TESTAMENT JEHOVAH, &gt;&gt; the word then which was the pillar of fire. He was made manifest and dwell amongst us. Jehovah of the Old Testament became Jesus of the New Testament. &gt;&gt; He became Jesus of the New Testament. HE WAS A PERFECT REFLECTION OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. A PERFECT REFLECTION of God that he CAME DOWN TO PERFECT everything that would have been lost before him. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that they didn't stand a chance? &gt;&gt; We wouldn't stand a chance. Your children don't stand a chance &gt;&gt; without that perfect reflection of God. He was absolutely perfect till he pleased the sculpture so much. Not Michelangelo this time. HE WAS SO PERFECT TILL HE PLEASED THE SCULPTOR SO much that he put him on Calvary for the entire world to see on display. perfection. The entire world looked up and saw perfection. The perfect masterpiece. THE PERFECT MASTERPIECE. NOW THERE FOR THE ENTIRE world to look at and to and to look at and say, "LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; savior of the world, perfect in all manners. But he said, just like Moses being smitten on the leg, this was a man that was marred above all men. He was marred so much till they didn't even He didn't even look like the son of man. He was beaten. He was bruised. He was bloody. He was stripped. everything that could be done. He looked like a big pile of blood and bones walking together. He didn't even look human. As they drugg him up to Calvary, God smoteed him. Not for God, for us. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it pleased God to know that he built a bride. that he was able to as Jesus was up ON THE CROSS ON CALVARY LOOKING LIKE A JUST A BIG PILE of blood and bones that he was able to reach in there and pull out of his side from the original creation. A bride that would look just like him, that would act just like him, that would talk just like him, &gt;&gt; that would pray just like him. everything she did would be just like him. 2,000 years. And I'm closing. 2,000 years. He says, God has been trying to cut him a masterpiece bride called a church. That's right. How would God ever do it? How would he ever do it? It's by his neverchanging method, the word. He never changes his method. Nobody. Nobody. You can. You can change. I can change. Time changes. The world changes. But God never changes. He's perfect. He's perfect. He doesn't change. And he and the way he does anything the first time, he does it that way every time. The same way. &gt;&gt; He doesn't change. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. We got to close. Some of you's got long drives. I can be home in about two minutes. So, I can go for another hour if you want. But I just think about the perfection of God. And I'm brought back to that very statement that I made at that one service. Perfect became imperfect. A pool of blood and bones and marred and spit on and mocked and scorned. perfect became that because that's what I should have been. And when we realize that that we're the ones that should have been there, we should have been that pile of blood and bones. He says, 'Oh, if the church today, if the church today could just reflect that first church when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost, if the Christians today could just reflect, How many tonight with your eyes closed, heads bowed, would just raise your hand to God and just say, "Lord, that's my heart's desire. I just want to be a Christian that could reflect what you are, Lord." in all manners of my life. I just want to be what you would have me to be. I want to be I want to be in that image that that is pleasing to you. I want the words that I speak to be pleasing to your ears. I want the songs that I sing to be pleasing to your ears. The things that my eyes view to be pleasing to your eyes because Lord, I realize that I was taken out of the side of my savior. that you've been building, you've been molding, you've been you've been shaping a bride down for thousands and thousands of years to be exactly what you would have her to be. You began in the garden, Lord, as you created out of the dust of the ground, Adam, the perfect creation. The perfect creation. And then and then the rib that was taken out, but it fell. Moses when he when Moses went be before the people and the people got to Moses and and he couldn't take it. He he just threw up his arms in disgust and he couldn't take it and he failed. Abraham when he was put to the test he lied said this is my sister Sarah twice. David. Oh Lord. David, a murderer, an adulterer. But there was the Christ. Thank you, Lord, for Jesus Christ. Thank you, Lord, for the blood that was shed. Thank you, Lord, for moving in our lives. So that when when we come to you with our faults and our failures, you don't look at that. You don't look at us as failures and and fault makers. You look at us through the through the blood of Jesus Christ and you look at us as redeemed. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Amen. We're going to try this song tonight. All my hope is in Jesus. Thank God my yesterday is gone. All my sins are forgiven. Thank you, Lord. Oh, and I've been washed by the blood.

Thank God my yesterday is gone. And all my sins are forgiven. And I've been washed by the blood. I'm no stranger to the prison. I've worn shackles and chains, but I've been freed and forgi.
