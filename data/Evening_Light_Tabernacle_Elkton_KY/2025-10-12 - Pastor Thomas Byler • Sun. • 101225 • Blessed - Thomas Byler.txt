Brother Josh, would you stand up and open the service in a word of prayer? Amen. Let's stand and turn our Bibles to Psalms 90. Say amen when you got it. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. Thou turnest men to destruction, and sayest, "Return, ye children of men." &gt;&gt; Thou carest them away as with a flood. They are asleep. In the morning, in the morning, they are like grass, which groweth up. For we are consumed by thy thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. &gt;&gt; For all our days are passed away in thy wrath. We spend our years as a tale that is told. who knoweth the power of thine anger, even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath. &gt;&gt; Return, O Lord, how long? And let it repent thee concerning thy servants. Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen evil. And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish thou the work of our hands upon us. Yay, the work of our hands, establish thou it. Amen. God bless you, Brother Brian. needed. Morning, brothers and sisters. If you would uh turn with me, excuse me, turn with me to the third chapter of Colossians. I was um going to say um from last week what people what people gave me as offering and stuff uh the rock that was put last week is all uh is all paid for and the church is pretty pretty close to still having uh 10 it's not 10 it's about 9,000 and change that's in the general fund. I I was uh which can be you know I was I was thinking how important is for us as believers as Christians this morning that we stay sealed into Jesus Christ this morning because I was just thinking the circumstances that surround us every day of our lives just like the past couple of weeks the brothers have been preaching to us that we really need to be sealed in. We need to have everything pushed out of our lives that's contrary to the word of God and be ready for when God calls us home. And I would I was just thinking out there and it what like the brothers were saying, you know, you can spend too much time doing useless things, but you can never spend enough time in God's word. And it's only in God's word that you'll be become a perfected Christian this morning. It's only in the message of the hour and reading your Bible this morning that you'll become perfected. That the things that you used to care about won't mean anything to you anymore. And you all you care about is what God wants you to do in your life. &gt;&gt; And I I was there a simple thought came this morning. I'll get to the first verse in Colossians here, the third chapter. I was thinking there's a spirit out there that's trying to move people. I was just thinking sitting there, we know that the scripture says that every you know the in Revelations it says all whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life will be deceived that that the that spirit of delusion will come upon them. And you can see it moving in the in the day that can I say it'll be tomorrow? No. I'm a man. I can't say that. Will it be a year from now? Will it be a week from now? We don't know the day or the hour. But we can look at the circumstances in the world this morning and know that we live in a late day. And you could never say that enough. The very world is warning people that you don't have the time anymore that you think you used to have and that you need to be serious about your relationship with Jesus Christ this morning. But I was thinking what's going on in the world, the foundations of everything are being shaken. And you know, like brother Brandham said, I was I was just the thought I get through, you know, I listen to a different ministers on YouTube, which can be I mean a good or a bad thing if you're not grounded. And notice I say you have to be grounded. You have to know what you believe &gt;&gt; or I wouldn't. But I was just thinking it's they're all trying to move you somewhere and where they're trying to move you to is not a good place. The only thing that'll move you to the right place is the message of the hour. And anyone telling you anything else than that is actually lying to you this morning and you need to stop listening to them. But what I thought was funny is people are leaving the Christian churches, the non-atholic or orthodox or Lutheran churches. They're leaving those Protestant churches and going back whether it's the Catholic or the Orthodox churches and they're having people are joining them in great numbers. And I was just thinking what would make people want to do that and and it goes back to exactly what I said the first sentence I said this morning. They're not grounded in the word of God this morning. And don't let anyone ever tell you that because you're a Christian in the year 2025 that what you believe doesn't go back to the beginning. Because what you believe this morning goes back to the beginning. And I was just thinking, they'll try to tell you that their church is the oldest church, they have the longest church, or we have this or we have that. And really struck me this morning. I'll just turn to it. You know, the Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church will tell you this morning that they're they're the real church because they go all the way back to the beginning. And I I'm not trying to be funny about this this morning, but I really find it striking. Anytime someone tells you something, then you know what I would you do? You have to go back to the word of God. You have to bring them back to the word of God. It's not my idea, not their idea. It's what the word of God has to say. And not trying to be funny here this morning, but I was thinking you all this morning can say that you belong to the original church, the unadulterated original church of the word of God this morning. You belong to that church. It's not a Catholic church. It's not an Orthodox church. It's not a Lutheran church. It's not a Bath church. It's a bloodwashed church that you belong to. And when they say, "Well, we we go all the way back to Peter." Well, what comes to my mind, if their church went all the way back to Peter, then what would they do? They would do what Peter did. They would do what Paul did. And and uh and I'll just read this here this morning and then I'll get back into Colossians. But uh let me I would take them back to the second chapter of Acts and they'll say well Peter was our first you know he'll whatever they call Peter whether it's Orthodox Protestant or Lutheran. Now Lutheran don't believe that Peter the church is built on Peter they believe it's built on Jesus Christ. We all believe it's bu built on the revelation of the word of God. But I'll just you they read this every every time that there's a baptism. Every morning we have or evening we have a baptism they read these scriptures. But Jesus is given the keys. I mean Peter is given the keys to the kingdom after the day of Pentecost. And what does he do? He opens the word of God and he opens salvation to the people. You've all probably read this a thousand times, a hundred times depending on your age. Well, this is where I would take them back to. Then if you believe Peter was your pope or Peter was the first man that the church is built on, have you done what he told you to do this morning? So I'll start reading from about the u about the 36th verse and I'll finish with the 47th. You know, like I said, if you don't have anything to say, if you just read the word of God, it speaks for itself this morning. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God had made the same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ. So everything, the whole everything is framed in Jesus Christ this morning. That you can't have anything foundation outside of that. It's not built on a man's idea. It's not built on anything this morning but Jesus Christ and the word of God. And he goes on to say, "Now you have heard this that and they were pricricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what do what shall we do?" And I want to I'll finish with this period here. Just remember that they all 120 of them were in the upper room, all the apostles, the women that followed Jesus, Jesus's mother was with him, everybody was there that day. And he goes and then he says, "Peter said unto them, repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." And this one scripture right here divides you divides everybody this morning. It that's what I would tell I would ask them, "Have you fulfilled this word of God this morning?" And of course, you know exactly what they're going to say. They're going to immediately start explain it away. But if you've got that fundamental faith this morning, they'll never be able to explain it away. And I'll just finish these verses here. And for as with many other words did he testify and exalt, saying, "Save yourselves from this unto generation." I missed the 39th verse there. And then they were gladly received the word and were baptized the same day were were added about 3,000 souls. and they continued steadfast in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and breaking bread and in prayers. And I'll I'll just finish jumping into uh Colossians the third chapter this morning. I was also thinking especially what the brother said last Sunday and brother Brad on Wednesday. You know there's two type of people in any church. There's the well-fed person and the stick man in the church or the stick woman in the church. And that's I don't mean to be funny. The stick woman or the stick man is the man that it just goes right across the top of their head and goes out the walls and they never receive it. So, one is growing on the word of God and the other one is dying on the word of God. And only God knows who that individual is. And I was just thinking it would be a horrible thing to spend your whole life thinking you're okay but never receiving the truth as God presents it to you. You know the one thing go as you're led to go. But it's really I I can't say it enough. I know I see it in my own life as I get older. All the things I say this a lot. I'm not afraid to say this. All the things that I thought I were important when I was 20 or 40, those things aren't important anymore. What's important to me is is it settled, you know, is it right in my heart and in my life this morning. I'll just read this in Colossians this morning. It kind of speaks to what what brother Brad was talking about on Wednesday. If you then be risen with Christ, what do you and it says here, seek those things which are above. That's what we desire. We're We're not trying to grow kingdoms on this earth. Everything we do is to grow a king. That everything we want to buy is on the other side. It's not here. And he goes on, "Think on those things above where Christ siteth on the right hand of God." I have to increase the reading. I have a hard time reading even these this big print. Set your affections on things above and not on things on the earth. for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ and God. It goes to what I was beginning to say this morning. It's really so important that your life be hid in Jesus Christ this morning. And it's not you doing it, but it's him doing it through you this morning. I I apologize. I know I say that a lot. I probably say it every Sunday I come up here, but it's still the word of God. And it's still the truth. You You won't get there on your own laurels. The only way you're going to get there is on Jesus Christ this morning. And when Christ who is our life shall appear, then you shall also appear with him in glory. It goes on to say mortify therefore your members which were upon the earth. So he's telling you to mortify your members. And what he means by that is that you're looking to put away all these things he's going to mention here. And uh forgive my pronunciation of some of these words, fornication, uncleanliness. And when you hear these words, your mind thinks of the world out there. It is totally running after these things this morning. Ignorant affections. That's really speaks to the society we live in this morning. Evil compance and covetousness, which is and I really thought about covetous, which is idolatry. And that really speaks to the age we're in. You know, when you desire what someone else has, the Bible says that's idolatry. I mean, that's a that's a really hard statement right there when you spend your whole life desiring to tear from other people the things they have. That's not a good place to be. For which things the sake of wrath cometh on the children of disobedience in which you you also walk sometime when you lived in them. And that goes back to what Peter said. The only way you escape this is by surrendering to Jesus Christ. Now know ye also put off all these and he's talking about us as Christians. Put off anger and wrath and malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. That's something most Christians I know myself you you got to as I get older, you know, it's I find like I said, I'm not afraid to say this. I see some of my father coming out of me as the older I get. Do I like that? No. I just need to work harder every day to make sure it doesn't come out. And it's line not one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds. And then put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him created he him. And he goes, and I'll finish with this last verse, the 11th verse this morning, where there is neither Greek, Greek nor Jew, circumcision or unc circumcision, barbarian, cynthian, bond nor free, but Christ is all and in all. You know, that's the thing about being a Christian this morning. All accounts are even. It doesn't make a difference where you came from, who your parents are, what what religion you came from originally. All accounts are squared even. Everyone's the same in Jesus Christ this morning. Whether you're a billionaire or you're the poorest person on the face of the earth, in Christ, everyone's equal this morning. And that's a comforting thought. So, it's a I was and I was also thinking, you know, that I was thinking there this morning. I I said I was going to finish, but another thought came to my mind. You know what's the one thing this world desires so much? It's all it wants peace. Remember what the scriptures say though. When it gets to a point where people are seeking peace, peace, peace, we all know what comes after that. So I if I ever said one thing to get for myself or anyone this morning, it's a late hour and we're totally dependent on Jesus Christ this morning. Brother Josh If that's the only mistake you make today, you'll be doing good. Brother Brian, God bless you. You love the Lord this morning. Amen. Let's stand this morning and enjoy the Sunday school this morning. And just love the Lord this morning. And let's sing that little chorus. I love you, Lord. And I lift my voice this morning. Amen.

And we've got a lot of folks out this morning and a lot will be traveling home today from the meetings and mom's gone to Arkansas and just different ones are gone. Brother John and them are gone to Johnson City. So, we just want to remember them. But we're glad for our visitors this morning.

But he he redeemed me this morning by his mercy and grace. And I'm excited this morning because it's joy unspeakable and full of glory this morning that the God that created this world could live inside of me. Amen. He loved me so much. And guess what?

And you know, I I I uh told Brother Steve, he asked me how I was doing and and I I get frustrated with me because I complain sometimes when I don't have anything to complain about. When I say I don't have anything, but sometimes I do because ever since this weather's changed, it's felt like that brother Willies took a ball bat to my right knee and just worked on it. It hurts all the time. But I thank Lord, you're a healer this morning. Mhm. &gt;&gt; You know, and what little I've got is not near the what someone else has need of.

And well, when I first fell in love with Jesus, I gave him all of my heart. I thought I couldn't love him more than I did right from the start. But when I look back over the mountains and the valleys where I've been, then it makes me know why I love him so much more than I did then. Oh, I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. Oh, he gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by.

Brother Aaron expressed, amen, his uh desire to give the Lord glory for what uh he's doing in his life. We thank God for the turnaround that we've seen in Aaron. And we pray that God will just be with him in a special way. So go ahead, brother Aaron, give us a testimony this morning. &gt;&gt; Well, I know that first God had to live me out of the lifestyle that I was living in because I couldn't leave it by myself. So I know that I finally just got to a place one point in my life where I gave up everything. And from that moment on, I know that God took control and um got me out of the lifestyle living in just been one blessing after another since I've left because I I was going to start at IHOP Monday, but HR happened to call Dakota. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Last time I worked for Hannah and told him that they were going to go ahead and hire me on where he worked at for$,750 an hour. I think I think it's about around that pay raise. But I get paid weekly. I'll be they train me on first shift starting out Monday morning. I got to be there at 5:45 and then I'm switching over to second shift with him and we're going to go back and forth to working with each other. So that's a real blessing. Um I got to it be Martin Rey and Springfield instead of IHOP. And it's just been one blessing after another. He's blessed me with a possibility, a vehicle. I've been really struggling trying to get a car and everything, but it's just been one blessing. I'm taking it one step at a time. And ever since I've been out of the lifestyle that I've been in, it's just been amazing. I think it's been real easygoing. I feel him every day. I try to redeem the time as much as I can and I'm just he's really blessed me for it. So, figured I'd share that with everybody this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. And no more seizures, huh? Praise the Lord. We're glad for that. Amen. God is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; How many is glad to be in the house of the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand with me this morning. We'll go before the Lord in prayer. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Kind heavenly father, we come before you this morning, Lord Jesus, desiring once again as we assemble ourselves together, Lord, in your name, Father, realizing God, that you said wherever two or three would gather in your name, there you would be in our midst, Lord. And we just believe that with all of our heart. We thank you, Father, for being here, Lord. and we just look forward to the time that you'll come to receive us to yourself, Lord Jesus. And we won't have to be in this world anymore. But we'll get to spend all of eternity with you and all the saints of all the ages that you have redeemed that you have washed by your blood and that you have brought back to yourself, Lord. Father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for testimony on what you're doing in Aaron's life. And we just pray, God, that you would further that work, Lord, and just make him a real son of God and a real man of God, Lord Jesus. and we thwart cast out the enemy Lord Jesus not just both around him but anyone anyone the devil would try to come at we rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ father we ask God that you would come now in a special way take every spirit under the control of the Holy Spirit Lord that your name would be glorified and that Lord we'd have liberty Lord Jesus to speak your word this morning according to what you have laid upon our hearts to speak this morning father help me to get out of the way Lord and just let the gift operate this morning accord according to your divine will and we thank you for your goodness now in Jesus name. Amen and amen. Amen. Let's just get into the word this morning. Amen. Right away uh we do have communion service that we want to uh observe this morning. And so Amen. Amen. If you will turn to Genesis 12. Genesis 12. have actually quite a bit of reading I want to do just to lay a foundation. Um, so just bear with me. Genesis 12:1-3. Now the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee, and I will make thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curses thee. And in thee shall all the families of the earth be," and let's all say that last word, &gt;&gt; blessed, &gt;&gt; blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it quite something that when he went and appeared to Abraham, told him to get out of the country, the one thing that all the families of the earth are going to benefit from is that they're all going to be &gt;&gt; blessed. &gt;&gt; Blessed. That's our title this morning. Blessed. Amen. Turn another one in Genesis 18. Genesis 18. And we'll begin with verse 18. Genesis 18 and 18. Amen. Let me let's start with 17. And the Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do? seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations. Now notice, let me see if it said it that. Yeah, if you notice in the chapter 12, it said, "And in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed." Here he says, "Surely he shall become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him." Amen. I don't know if you understand just what that means, but we want to try to bring that out this morning and show just what that means. That &gt;&gt; Amen. So any blessing, this blessings that started started with Abraham. &gt;&gt; That's where it all started at. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's another one in chapter 22. He says it again. whenever he had uh obeyed and had offered up Isaac and not withheld his only son. And because he had done this, verse 15, "And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, by by myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing, I will bless thee." Notice what it's all about. It's about blessing, isn't it? Amen. How many feels blessed this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're blessed. &gt;&gt; I am blessed. I am blessed. Every day that I live, &gt;&gt; I am blessed. When I wake up in the morning, when I lay my head to rest, we're blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll look at the definition of that here in a minute. Blessing, I will bless thee. And in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and in thy seed. Now notice he said in thy seed in thy seed uh and thy seed shall possess the gates of these enemies and in thy seed. Verse 18 is what I was looking for. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice. Once again, the thing that everybody gets is a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just don't know how blessed we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let's uh go to Galatians real quick. Galatians 3. We'll see the fulfillment of this scripture and we'll also see what the seed that he was talking about and how that it would be blessed and how that it would come. Amen. And I had just actually these three scriptures, but I knew Galatians somewhere Paul talked about this and I wasn't just sure how it was, but I found it in chapter 3 of Galatians. Amen. We'll go with verse six. Even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness, know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen. Hello, the nations, right? The heathen. All nations, not just Israel, but all the nations be blessed. All the heathens will be blessed, justified through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. &gt;&gt; So that they which are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. &gt;&gt; How many believes in order to tap into this blessing, you got to have the faith of Abraham. &gt;&gt; You'll never tap into it outside of that. Amen. Verse 13. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. For it is written, cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree. Now, how many know that Jesus became a curse for us? And this is through Calvary. Amen. Coming through the cross comes the blessing. Ain't that right? that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith. Now notice verse 16. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not to seeds as of many, but as of one. Amen. And to thy seed. Isn't that right? Which is Christ. Amen. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can be seated this morning. Amen. So, praise the Lord. So, we know that it is through Jesus Christ that this blessing has come and it comes to all the world. Amen. I'm going to read another one before I uh really start. So the blessings came through Jesus Christ. Amen. That's where the blessings came through. Started with Abraham and his seed and and and uh which is the seed which was Christ. Amen. In the beginning of Abraham, God said that he would bless in blessing I'm going to bless thee. Amen. And in through thee all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. And he that blesses thee will be blessed. He that curses thee will be cursed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And really, when you think about it, in this life and in this world, there's really only two things. Amen. Right and wrong, good and evil, blessing or cursed, blessing or not blessed. Amen. Amen. When we talk about heaven, the land of the blessed, right? Amen. Heaven is going to be for the land of the blessed. Amen. Hell is for the damned, the cursed. Isn't that right? When Jesus preached his first sermon, when Jesus come along, preached his first sermon, he started out with the word blessed. First word, blessed or blessed. Blessed. Chapter 5 of Matthew. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed, blessed, blessed. [Music] &gt;&gt; How many is blessed? &gt;&gt; Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake. Amen. For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely. Amen. For my sake, rejoice and be exceedingly glad. For great is your reward in heaven. for so persecuted the prophets that were before you. All right. The definition of blessed according to Amen. Uh all right. Now let's look at the definition of what is the Bible's definition of blessed in the Bible. Being blessed means having God's favor. &gt;&gt; Having God's favor. Now, how many knows whenever God God called Noah and that said, "Thou has found favor." He found favor with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Found favor with God. It's not. That's right. having favor with God, experiencing his grace, and receiving spiritual well-being that brings deep inner contentment and joy. Now, here here's here's here's a part I want to get to a little bit later, and that is regardless of circumstances. Regardless of circumstances, In other words, the God of the mountain is still God in the valley. God of the good times is the God in the bad time. The one thing the world can't do, the one thing the world can't do. They can all be happy in the good times, when everything's going well, oh, everything's good, but when somebody cuts them off on the road or whatever it might be, they turn to the other side. Ain't that right? They can't be happy in the bad times. Hello. But a Christian is not. Let me stop just a couple minutes. How many know? Noah found favor with God. Abraham what? Found favor with God. How many believes that? Amen. Mary. Mary said, "Blessed art thou Mary among women." Ain't that right? Because thou art highly favored. &gt;&gt; How many know my Mary was highly favored and she that's why God cho God chose her. She was blessed among women. How many believe that the church of the bride of Christ is blessed among churches? &gt;&gt; Among all the women, the bride is especially blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. I maybe I'll just go ahead and preach this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Gersam here. Amen. you know, he come and visited with us and everything and he's a handsome fellow, right? &gt;&gt; You know, he and you know there was a lot of girls in the church. Is that right? Could chose from that right? Sure. Other church there was other churches. Plenty of girls message people got how many knows in the message there's a lot of girls. Finding a good guy is a little bit hard because they outnumber them about three to one almost from in my vocabulary. Hello. Because I've seen it. I've had the gettogethers. And I'm here to tell you, you know, they outnumber them so forth. And you know when But you know, you know when he chose that one, ain't that right? That one that found favor in his sight. Isn't that right? One that is highly favored. Amen. highly enough favored to ask her to marry him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Highly favored. And that's the way it is with God and his people. If God if you found favor with God, you're a blessed person. Praise the Lord. How many's glad that you found favor with God? How many's glad that Jesus said, "Have hunger and thirst after righteousness?" I'm so glad that there was a hunger that there was a thirst for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. People that don't want to go to church, don't sit in the church. They're bored in church. They don't want nothing to do with it. You are Well, you're in a bad shape. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're happy out mowing your yard instead of going to church. You're happy with some old stale dead church somewhere that don't even preach the truth. Hello. &gt;&gt; No, we don't. We don't want no part of that. Why? We want something that's alive, something that's real. We want God in our midst. We've got a hunger for more of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're very blessed people. I got to thinking of how that my goodness, you know, here we are both naturally and spiritually, we're blessed. &gt;&gt; All right, let me let me finish this thought of the definition of blessed before we go to preaching. That's right. An inner contentment and joy regardless of circumstances. While God originally blessed creation with flourishing and multiplification, the meaning evolved to a state of spiritual prosperity marked by forgiveness, faith, a close relationship with God and satisfaction that is found in him. I'm sisfied with just a cottage below, a little silver and a little gold, but we're mostly satisfied because we have him. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Key aspects of blessed. The Bible says God's favor and grace. The most fundamental meaning of a blessing from God is his undeserved favor and grace. &gt;&gt; Undeserved. How many know we didn't deserve it? &gt;&gt; No. But still we found favor with him. Given by his mercy. &gt;&gt; Now apply that to nations. Apply that to every family in the earth. Every nation has been given this, &gt;&gt; granted it. Come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden. He calls the whole world. Calls everybody. &gt;&gt; But there's just a few that really desire it. &gt;&gt; Got that hunger, that that blessedness of being hungry for more of God. Amen. All right. Given by his mercy, spiritual well-being. Blessed refers to a spiritual state of inner happiness, joy, and contentment that is not dependent upon material wealth or positive circumstances. Amen. Y'all are crying on that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, we'll we'll just go ahead and jump right into this one. See, Job, he had some really bad stuff happen to him, &gt;&gt; didn't he? went the devil went out there and wind came down and smoked the corners of the house and fell on all of his m all of his sons and daughters all of his stuff everything was taken away the devil said to God he says I'll make him curse you to your face cuz he had everything he had hedge about him he had a good life it was all wonderful but when Job heard all these things he rode he got up his mantel shaved his head fell down and to the ground and worshiped Amen. You want to know how to worship God? He said, "Naked came out of my father's womb and naked life returned thither. The Lord gave, the Lord taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." &gt;&gt; How many me believe the real true blessedness of God doesn't go just because of man everything that's going good or how things are going. No, it's something that has an anchor down in your soul. And that anchor is God. The world doesn't have that, but you've got that this morning. You're blessed to have that. &gt;&gt; Cuz without that, we'd all go crazy. We'd all be nuts. We'd all have road rage. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Rage of all kinds. Praise the Lord. Not depending on material wealth or positive circumstances. Inner sax, inner satisfaction in God. True spiritual blessing means being fully satisfied in God alone. Amen. I'm here to tell you, I'm going to tell you again. I'm here to tell you that if you haven't got God in your heart and you're not satisfied with your relationship with God, you won't be happy with your wife. You won't be happy with your husband. You won't be happy with your job. You won't be happy with your dog. You won't be happy with your cat. You just won't be happy. Why? Because you haven't got that inner happiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. The pray pastor, he's just not good enough. The preacher ain't good enough. The church ain't good enough. The deacon ain't good enough. Trustees ain't good enough. &gt;&gt; Hello. Just total no satisfaction. But brother preach, he says, man, you find just such a discontent. People everywhere are not satisfied. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm here to tell you if you have a car and you have the Amen. and you have a car and you you know you don't know nothing about the mechanics, you don't even know you're supposed to put gas in it, you're going to have problems down the road. Amen. When that tank gets empty, you're going to run out and say, "What is wrong with this car?" About as bad as seeing YouTube these women and different Wells, I'll say women, but that's what they have trying to put gas in an electric car. How do I get this thing in here? How do I get this thing in here? It helps to know something about what it is. And how many knows that people don't know what you are made for? We were not made to be empty. Our heart was made to be filled. You and I, we need satisfaction. Everybody needs satisfaction. Amen. But praise be to God. We understand. Amen. That if your car don't start, get out there, pop the hood. Amen. Wiggle that positive wire a little bit. Make sure that it's connected good. Amen. Maybe it was loosened. tighten that thing up and whoop, here we go. That's the way with your life. If it ain't purring the way that it ought to, if you ain't got joy unspeakable, I like that song that Brother David said, "Well, I have found his grace is all complete. It supplies my every need. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory. Full of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, blows. It flows." Amen. It just flows. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God wants you to have joy unspeakable and full of glory. Amen. David, he got so so much of God. Amen. He says, "My cup is full and it's running over." How many believe that with what you got, with what I got, our cups ought to be full this morning. It ought to be running over a little bit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If it ain't, it ain't God's fault. He's got us plenty to drink. He's got us plenty to eat. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you ain't eating and you ain't drinking the way you ought to, &gt;&gt; you that spiritual deprived person, that hungry person, &gt;&gt; not getting nothing out of the service, why don't you repent? Why don't you fix that problem? Get right to where you come to church. Amen. You pull from the gift of God. You go out a better person than what you come in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I'll tell you what. Amen. All we are blessed. If you are in Christ, every blessing comes from Almighty God. It all comes from Christ. &gt;&gt; We are blessed above measure through Jesus Christ, the son of the living God that went to Calvary for us. &gt;&gt; All the nations to be blessed. They can all be blessed. &gt;&gt; They talk about white people having privilege. White privilege. Ain't that right? I want you to know I took that word and I thought you know that word privilege to me can be used instead of blessed &gt;&gt; instead of blessed. Talk about privilege. How many believe we're a privileged people? We're a blessed people &gt;&gt; to have the privilege of something that gives you access to something. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not the UPC, as Dale Potter always said, the underprivileged children. We're not underprivileged. &gt;&gt; We're overprivileged. Do you realize that God has given you everything? Paul said, "Whether it's life, whether it's death, things, present, the future, God has given us everything. We are heirs of all things. The meek shall inherit the earth. Don't be excited about those two acres of that nice house you got. You're going to inherit the whole earth. &gt;&gt; That don't do something for you. I don't know what you need to drink. &gt;&gt; You need some more of the Holy Ghost is what you need to drink more of. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Get with me. Preach with me this morning. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I am blessed. &gt;&gt; I am blessed. Every day that I live, I am blessed. &gt;&gt; My cup is full and it's running over. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I'm enjoying. How many believe that we are enjoying what God gave to Abraham way back there? In these shall all the nations, all the families shall be blessed through you. &gt;&gt; And through your seed, which is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Let me go a little different direction for a minute. We sing that song. song, count your blessings. Name them one by one. &gt;&gt; Count your blessings. I'm here to tell you that when you start counting your blessings, &gt;&gt; you will give God glory and praise and thanks, you won't have time to complain. &gt;&gt; You won't have time to You'll be too busy counting some more blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just keep on counting. I thought, man, just to be standing here. &gt;&gt; I'm blessed to be standing here. &gt;&gt; I'm blessed to be able to jump. &gt;&gt; You know how many people are wheelchair ridden and can't walk? Oh, praise be to God. I'm glad I can stand this morning. I'm glad I can wave my arms this morning. I'm glad I can praise God this morning. I'm glad I got my movement. I God, I thank God for everything. We got to be like Stonewall Jackson. Amen. I don't take a sip of water, but I thank God for. There ain't nothing I don't thank God for. Why? Cuz it's all a blessing. &gt;&gt; We're blessed to be able to meet here this morning. Brother said they'll shut us down one of these days. So enjoy the time that you got. [Applause] Enjoy your blessings &gt;&gt; because we won't always have them. &gt;&gt; Privileges and everything else will be taken from us. Brother Ram said, &gt;&gt; the world, look at how it's going now. They're already shooting and killing people for going out there and preaching the gospel and talking about Jesus, shooting them in the head. But Abraham says, "I'll come when they'll shoot you if you go try to offer prayer for somebody." Getting pretty close. My You love him. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. So I thought, you know, the whole world is blessed. The sinner is blessed. And you know the problem is is that people take things for granted. &gt;&gt; They don't realize how privileged they are or how blessed they are. &gt;&gt; You know how blessed the sinner is out there today? &gt;&gt; Why is he blessed, brother Ber? I always like when the preacher tells me what what he's talking about. How are they blessed? Right now they get to enjoy the glory of God. &gt;&gt; They live in the glory of God. Didn't the Bible say that the whole earth is filled with his glory? &gt;&gt; The whole earth is full of his glory also. The whole world is filled with his power. How many believe the power of God is everywhere? &gt;&gt; Sure. What did Brother Ram say? He said, "Take a plate of grass or that oak tree or that peach tree or that apple tree." What tells that sap to run down in the winter time? Why are those leaves changing? Cuz somebody is telling it it's time to go down and hide. It's time to get out of the bad cold weather, the freezing cold, cuz it would kill him if it didn't everywhere. What's holding that sun up there? What's holding that moon up there? &gt;&gt; Oh, the presence of God unrecognized. Brother Brandon preached, they don't recognize the presence of God. They get to get their boats and they get to go out there, enjoy the water. They get to go by the beach and fill the beach and enjoy the sunset. Oh, it's such a pretty sunset. You're privileged cuz someday everything's going to be dark unless you repent. There ain't going to be no sun to warm you. &gt;&gt; They sunbathe. They like to warm themselves in the sun. That's a privilege to enjoy the glory of God. All the things that they do that they enjoy. That's all in enjoying the glory of God. Enjoying the sun just right, the temperance just right. cuz I'm here today and tell you one of these days they're going to be in a place that is way way too hot. They're not going to be comfortable. They're going to be miserable. &gt;&gt; They're going to be in hell. They're going to be in darkness. And they're not going to have that privilege. But do they ever look up and say, "Thank you, God." No, they don't. &gt;&gt; But we do. We come to church and say, "I thank God for all of his goodness. I thank him for his grace. I thank him for his mercy. I am blessed and I enjoy having that blessing. &gt;&gt; So the sinner, the ungodly, they get to enjoy it. What if that sun didn't come up of a morning? Hello. What if it went too hot? What if things were really like they try to make it to be? You know how they try to make it to be? to try to make it that it's just evolution. Just by chance. Just by chance. Are y'all with me now? &gt;&gt; Tell me something. How can they know when Haley's comet will come back around? How? And everything. The tides turning. They can tell you what the tides are coming in, the moon, the phase of it, every month way ahead of time. It all stays in time, don't it? And you think that's by chance. So I say, "How stupid can you be?" &gt;&gt; How stupid can you be to think that would just accidentally happen? No, that doesn't just accidentally happen. There is a God in heaven that makes everything revolve just the way that it's supposed to do. How many is counting on it this morning that you are part of his thoughts? You are part of his word. And you're doing exactly what he wants you to do in the age that you're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're enjoying watching the power of God as that sun sets, but they don't have it in here. It's all external. In here, there's no fulfillment. There's no joy. There's no blessedness of forgiveness. How many believe that forgiveness is a blessedness? Amen. Peace is a blessedness. Joy is a blessedness. People will pursue become billionaires. Amen. To try to find joy. You can become a multi-billionaire and not have a lick of joy and be more miserable than what you ever was. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz it doesn't come that way, &gt;&gt; does it? No, it doesn't come that way. Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Bam says when God send a gift to the earth, if that generation receives that gift, then they become a blessed people. Amen. How many has accepted the gift that God gave of Malachi for the gift of a prophet? &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed this, blessed that. Brother Brand preach a message called, Amen, the forgotten beatitude. Amen. Blessed is he that is not offended in me. Amen. Because people are offended at the word of God. Blessed are you when the word don't offend you. &gt;&gt; But when the word offends people, how many knows it offends denominations? If you're offended in Christ, you're not a blessed person. You become a blessed people. And if they turn from it, turn it down, they become a curse pe cursed people always. Then he goes to talking about look at Jesus' hour, the greatest gift of all. Ain't that right? And they turned him down. And look at the curse. They were scattered to all nations. Jerusalem and those that were trapped in it. Ended up eating the bark off the tree and boiling each other's kids for something to eat. &gt;&gt; It was a terrible, terrible thing. It was a curse. How many in here have grieved the Holy Spirit away from your heart and know what it's like to feel that curse, that condemnation, that emptiness? Hello. &gt;&gt; Get away from God and there's a curse there. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way it is with the world. But I was looking that up. But Bam says, "Whether it's a country, whether it's an individual, whether it's a church, when you get away from God, Amen. the judgment and wrath of God is upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You reap what you sow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just because we were founded on Plymouth Rock and religions and so forth, don't spare us. Amen. From another nation coming in and taking over, we've swn and now we're going to repossess. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Everything. Think about it. Don't appreciate the sun that comes. And brother Bam talked about how that this sun is what brings and keeps life upon the earth because without that there would be no food, would there? No, they don't appreciate the growing of the orange trees, the apple trees, the fruit trees, and the vegetation. That's all God. &gt;&gt; How many believes every time you put something in your mouth, you say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus. You provided the food that I eat. &gt;&gt; He provides the food that you eat. &gt;&gt; I like to chew it extra much." And thank you, Lord. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And I'd like good food. If you ever go to Evansville, go to their what's it called, Donna? Go to that Golden Corral. My my I may have sinned just a little bit. If gluttony is sinful, cuz I'm here to tell you, told my wife, I I tell you what, we got to go to that restaurant. We got to go because it ain't It ain't like a lot of them. A lot of them ain't got the best, but they got some stuff, man. I had two plates in my hand. One guy goes by. He says, "You going to eat all that?" "Yes, sir, I am." Well, good for you. At least you can. I ate that and got another one. And thank the Lord. How many good We got good food. We got everything. Amen. How many believe we're blessed people? &gt;&gt; Amen. We truly are. Brother Brandham said it this way. friends. We walk around here. He said, "We wear good clothes. The best clothes." &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought, "Look at the suit." I wanted to thank y'all for my Christmas present. This is my Christmas present. Y'all bought me a nice suit. &gt;&gt; Thank you. We wear good clothes. The best clothes. The best dressed people in the world is Americans. We are the best fed people in the world is Americans. &gt;&gt; That's right. Let me hear it a little. You enjoy that good steak. You enjoy that good food. Thank the Lord. Say, "Thank you, Jesus." &gt;&gt; I was coming down the road this morning. I told my wife, "I'm glad I ain't got to drive no horse and buggy. I like this Dodge right here. I like my garage." &gt;&gt; And I told her, "Or my Chevy &gt;&gt; or my Toyota or my our bug, whichever we want to drive." And I thank God for good paved roads. &gt;&gt; Hello. Good paved roads. &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God for good doctors. We got, you know, think about all the good things that God has given us. &gt;&gt; How many believe it's a good church? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Good group of people and we can come out on Wednesday and on Sunday and enjoy each other's presence &gt;&gt; and hear the true word of God. I must say, I'm going to just think about it. We are the best fed people. How many believes this morning you are spiritually the best fed people on the face of the earth? Message people that'll quit a church and say, "Well, I'm just not being fed." &gt;&gt; That's right. People have said it. I'm just not being fed. You know the problem it is? I'll tell you what the problem is. That person is little bitty baby that can't handle the spoon yet. Cuz you ain't got to shouldn't have to rely on the preacher to feed you. You can feed yourself. You can feed all day long 24/7. If you're hungry and not being fed, you just plain backslid. Jesus Christ came into this world to save sinners. Hey, the little old lady in the back of the room remember the story that she came from the hills and she says, "Amen." Everybody else turned around like, "What are you all excited about?" Hello. That feeds your soul. It's the truth. Amen. Praise the Lord. God is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Well fed. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise the Lord. Americans best fed in the merit world is Americans drive the best automobiles in the world. They got the most money anybody got in the world. Hello. We may not have the most money, but Trump and all these other guys, right? Got all these money. Sure, they got the most money in the world. richest men probably in the whole world right out of well I can't say for sure Saudi Arabia some of them princes and so forth they're pretty pretty rich the best automobiles I mean glad to have a good automobile &gt;&gt; that's right I remember back in the 70s drive them old clutters man I'd have to I'd have to you know you'd have all kinds of problems used to see a lot more cars on the side of the road you're starting to see more Now again, ain't that right? That's right. We got the best. We got the best of everything in the world. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Look at our supermarkets. There's hardly anything that you can't get on your phone and have it delivered to your house in three days. &gt;&gt; Well, you ain't happy about that. I'm happy about that. You know how much money I have saved? I told Donna sometimes we will go buy something and and we pay three times the price we got on Amazon and say, "Look, here's the same thing for a fraction of the price." I told her, I says, "Let's always make sure that if we're fixing to buy something, we go on Amazon first. Go online first, then we'll go to the auto parts or wherever we got to go." Amen. The best of everything. How many knows we're there's so much &gt;&gt; brother Bam says you know in his leisia it was called wretched the word comes from the Greek words which means endure a trial it has nothing to do with the trials that come to a true Christian for God describes the Christian's trial as blessed and his attitude of one of joy whereas the description of this phrase is called wretched and miserable now here's a str here's my favorite quote as you know how strange in this age of plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance. H isn't it strange? How can there be any trials in this age of plenty and opportunity when everybody has so much and there's so much more to be had and all of our inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure but yet we find a mental illness. &gt;&gt; Taking pep pills, you know, to get up during the day, sedatives at night, the change in institutions are filling up. How many believes that this Gen Z, this new generation of young people, they don't know what they've got. &gt;&gt; They want communism. They don't want America. A lot of our senators, they don't want America anymore. &gt;&gt; All right. I'm going to talk a little bit of polics here. Politics here. I want to set your mind right about the politics. I want it to be the the attitude that we have here. It's the attitude I have. Whether you have it or not, that's up to you. Sometimes me and my wife were sitting on the couch and we're talking about these people that really hate America. How can they be in there? You know, and all kinds of things. Man, you work yourself up thinking, man, why haven't why hasn't there been a revolution? Why don't people rise up? I said, Brother Bam said, America has needed a revolution a long time ago. and he said that he she needed a counterrevolution to that revolutions. So in brother Bham's opinion he didn't needed a couple revolutions already back in his day. &gt;&gt; But I said look as long as you're looking at wishing this could be this way or wanting that to be that way and this ain't right, you're going to kind of get worked up. But I said the right attitude is to realize well praise God. That's what brother Brandham said it would do. It's going to get worse and worse. It'll never get better until the skies catch on fire. But just have the right attitude towards politics. Don't think it's going to get any better. Amen. Look for the coming of the Lord. Get ready to get out of here. That's the right attitude. Not thinking you're going to change the politics out there by voting for another president, this, that, or the other. Not saying you can't vote or anything, but you understand. We're thankful for any good that's still there. But to have the attitude, oh boy, if they just do this, if they just do that, don't even go there. How many's with me? shouldn't even go there cuz it's not &gt;&gt; bless praise the lord &gt;&gt; plenty all the inventions to do our work to give us pleasure amen when I thought my what what how many believes that the gospel even as things brother Bam said even as things have progressed in the natural &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; amen and Julie you don't have to go out there and hitch up the buggy the horse. Is that right? And clean up the manure while you're at it. We don't want that laying around. Ain't got to do that. Huh? &gt;&gt; How many of you sisters enjoy opening that dishwasher and putting the dishes in? &gt;&gt; I think it's getting to where they want somebody to even put them in there. Hey, one, hey, can you load the dishwasher? People don't even want to load to a dishwasher anymore. That's getting pretty lazy. I told my wife, "Honey, I'm going to do the dishes. I'm going to do all your dishes for you. I'm going to go buy you a dishwasher." For a while, she didn't want one. She didn't trust them to get her clean, her stuff clean, but she finally come around. Amen. But how many's glad for the spiritual progress? &gt;&gt; Amen. We used to think you had to be doing this and you had to be doing that and you got to be Amish. You got to be menite. You got to buy obey all this. You got to do that or the other. And we found out that we're saved by grace. And that alone. &gt;&gt; What we do, we do because we love God. &gt;&gt; And if we still have that desire to do wrong, then you need more get more God in your heart. &gt;&gt; How many is with me on that? &gt;&gt; That if you still have a desire, Amen. and it overrules, you need more of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost will take that right out of your heart and out of your life. We've got a seven course meal. How many believe we got fruits? We got vegetables. I like that sausage. I like those peppers. And I like those onions all mixed together. Oh, I love them onions. Hello. Oh my. I like that statue of a perfect man. I like that Godhead. I like that water baptism. Amen. I like that inner man. &gt;&gt; The hidden man. Hidden mana. Yes. &gt;&gt; Woo. Brother said under that veil when you get behind that you kind of glory. Every day is good day to you. Whether it's cloudy on the inside, outside, some people got to go to revival to get back refreshed again. But you meet a person that's hidden away. Boy, if there's anything I need to preach more of, I believe it's that we need to get so hidden away. Amen. I don't care if you ain't been in a revival in six months. You're still just as wide as you ever was. Settle down, brother Ber. Settle down. I got to talk to myself. How many believes God is good? &gt;&gt; I David, I know what you was talking about, man. I know what you take talking about when you said, "My cup is full and running over." Brother Brandon would say the same thing. Yeah, Paul. Yeah, David, I know what you was talking about. Amen. My cup is full and running over. running, running, running around that tree, praising God. Hallelujah. Amen. If somebody heard me, they'd have thought some crazy man was up there in that woods. I believe it's about time we get a little bit crazy for God. Why? Because he's worthy of our praise. He's worthy of glory and honor and blessing. &gt;&gt; He's worthy of whatever you give him. He's worthy of our dance. &gt;&gt; Woo! He's worthy of our shout. He don't deserve some dry, cold, dead form of worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't think I was going to get off the ground this morning, but I believe we're off the ground. How many's been blessed? Blessed by what? By having him, the Holy Spirit in your heart. Amen. Let me tell you what we got to be careful of. Evening light tabernacle. People of Evening Life Tabernacle, be careful of this. That you don't go looking for a super message preacher. Well, I want a super message preacher. I want a hero of a preacher. Hello. &gt;&gt; Some people want to look to a man for some greatness. What you need to realize is that great man is right there in your heart in the form of the Holy Ghost. It's Jesus Christ is the great man. He's the one that we look to. That's the one that we admire. That's the one we adore. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll tell you what, he goes with you to your job. He goes with you wherever you go. He gives you joy. He gives you revelation. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the great one among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not me or any other preacher. &gt;&gt; It's Christ that's the great one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Couple more thoughts I maybe just share. That was one of them. The other one was that I believe that the devil Bible talks about &gt;&gt; I think I turned it back on. I'm playing with my button back here. What are you switching it on for? Getting a little excited. Bible talks about that beast having seven heads and 10 horns. You know, I've almost concluded, sister, that the devil, if you cut his head off, he can grow it back. Huh? You can grow it back. Why do you say that, brother? Well, because my wife, as you know, the devil has tried to put cancer on her. Is that right? And since then, even in the last few weeks, sometimes he'll try to put a fear on her. Try to put some kind of feeling on her. Not that's just some feeling that be. He's just trying to get in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the last few weeks, her legs have swelled up and changed colors, blistered a little bit like and got all discolored. We was really wondering what it was. And we've went to pray and just the devil. Ain't that right? Just the devil. Amen. And this morning, by God's grace, it's very, very good. Amen. But I say that because every time he sticks his head up, we cut it off. &gt;&gt; It ain't long. Here it comes again. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Why? He just can't seem to kill him. He just keeps sticking his head up. Ain't that right? And he probably will do that. But one of these days, we're not going to cut his head off. We're going to kick his whole body into the bottomless pit and we're going to have no more trials with him. He's not going to have pester us anymore. You're never going to have to suffer depression. You're never going to be down and have the blues. We're going to kick him off into the pit. Once and for all. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning. We'll stop there. Amen. We should be the happiest people on the face of the earth. How many believe that? The other quote that I had under that is our cup should be full and running over. How many believes we don't have to splatter in that little old pond anymore? That's only knee deep. That's only waist deep. You ain't got to go flopping into that. Not waist deep, but just ankle deep, flopping in it, trying to swim. Y'all remember brother Brandham telling the story of he told his dad that he could swim and he jumped in some water hole. Wasn't even hardly big enough to cover him. And he went to swimming. His dad said, "Son, get yourself up out of that mud hole. Clean yourself up." &gt;&gt; He was quite a rough daddy, but he thought he could swim. But let me tell you something. How many believe we ain't got to do that? No. How many believe we swim in a pure river of life, clear as crystal? &gt;&gt; Amen. Drink from the fountains of living waters. We're a privileged people. We've been blessed. Blessed. Blessed. That's why we sing. We'll sing this song as we change it. Can you pull that? We bless your name up. We bless your name because he has blessed us and we know we only got any blessings. Any blessings only comes from him. &gt;&gt; That's why we sing. We bless your name. We musicians, you don't have to come because I'm just we're going to have this without music. Okay, y'all help me out. We bless your name. We bless your name. We give you honor. We give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. Stand with me. this morning. Lord Jesus, we come before you from the bottom of our hearts singing this song that we truly bless your name. Lord, we bless your name. We give you honor. We give you praise and we honor you, Lord Jesus. Father, this morning we want to thank you, Lord, for every good gift, every blessing that you have bestowed upon us. Lord, we didn't even get into talking about that even in the trials very much, Lord Jesus, but we're blessed even when trials come upon us, Lord, because it turns us into pure gold. And we thank you, Lord Jesus, like Paul said, I have learned in the in in the aspect of respect to be content in whatever state that I am, Lord. But we ask God that we'd always be thankful, Father, in whatever state we are knowing, God, that even if we come down to the door of death, we're still blessed because we have one that's going to carry us across the river, Lord. No matter what our bad situation might be, Lord, we're always still blessed, God. And so we bless your name. We bless your name. And Father, this morning as we brought this change to the order of the service, Lord, to remember what you did on Calvary to make this blessing available through Jesus Christ. For we know that's truly what you was talking about, Lord, is the inner peace that we get, Father, from the blessing of Almighty God through the avenue of forgiveness because of the cross of Calvary. Lord, we observe this this morning, this communion, Father, in honor and in respect of what you have done for us, Lord, in purchasing our blessing. And we receive every blessing that you have bestowed upon us, Father. Bless the communion service now. We ask in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. Turn your Bibles right away if you will to First Corinthians. We'll just get into the word. Did you enjoy the word this morning? &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand. Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. We appreciate it, Father." Amen. I felt like when it first came, it just that word bless. It just popped up in my head and I began to think about it and that seems to be the way that the Lord wanted me to go. So, I trust it was a blessing to you. Amen. 1 Corinthians the 11th chapter. 1 Corinthians 11. Amen. Praise the Lord. Beginning with verse 23. For I have received of the Lord, that which also I delivered unto you, the same the Lord that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as oft drink it in remembrance of me." Amen. This morning when I do that, and when I remember him, I remember all the blessings that he bought for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many was with was with me? Amen. That's right. We remember all that he did. For as often as you eat of this bread and drink of this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. How many knows? You know if you know got the Holy Ghost or not. You know if you're right with God or not. Let a man examine himself. So let him eat of that. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkketh amnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tar one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order. When I come, I like to have a few moment of silence so that you can take that little
