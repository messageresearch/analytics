[43:44] amen we're a blessed people this morning
[43:46] uh
[43:47] if you want to turn in your bibles while
[43:48] you're turning i'm going to read a quote
[43:50] i will read in the book of hosea this
[43:52] morning
[43:57] and while you're turning there i just
[44:00] want to read a little quote here that
[44:01] the prophet
[44:02] shared to lay a foundation of our
[44:05] thoughts this morning
[44:07] and i trust it it will all pull together
[44:10] and
[44:10] got a couple of different stories we're
[44:12] going to get into and and thoughts in
[44:14] the bible
[44:17] maybe something than you
[44:21] heard scriptures and and um and it can
[44:24] be
[44:24] tied together with the message so that's
[44:26] the way i look at if you've got your
[44:27] front sight and your rear sight and they
[44:28] line up you'll hit your target so
[44:30] uh brother brown says uh
[44:34] he says now jesus said and the
[44:35] scriptures declare that god has hid the
[44:37] gospel from the eyes of the wise and the
[44:39] prudent
[44:40] so you'll never know it by theology and
[44:43] reveal it
[44:44] to babes such as will learn is that
[44:46] right he says just remember it's hid
[44:48] from the smart people you'll never know
[44:49] it
[44:50] you don't know it by your theology or by
[44:52] your education
[44:53] you know it by your faith you believe it
[44:56] and faith is something that you can't
[44:58] see
[44:58] or know he said did you ever read a line
[45:01] from your wife
[45:03] he said when i was in africa my wife
[45:05] would write me a letter and she would
[45:06] say dear husband i'm sitting here
[45:08] tonight thinking of you
[45:09] he said i love her he said when i left
[45:12] home i didn't have to say to her
[45:13] now look don't do this don't go with
[45:16] nobody
[45:17] else i'm your husband and you don't go
[45:19] out here and you don't do that
[45:21] and i don't have to do that because she
[45:23] loves me and i love her
[45:26] he said and i say goodbye honey pray for
[45:28] me
[45:29] and i go on and i know that's what she
[45:31] does
[45:32] she does it and i do the same because i
[45:34] love her and she loves me
[45:37] so it's just a love affair he said
[45:40] that's the same way it is with god
[45:42] i just take his word that's all there is
[45:44] to it no matter what
[45:46] you see he said but when she writes me a
[45:48] letter now listen to this
[45:50] when she writes me a letter she might
[45:52] kind of hold a little bit back
[45:54] and refrain she'll say a certain certain
[45:57] thing
[45:58] but i know she's talking and i'm in the
[46:01] letter reading that letter
[46:02] i can read between the lines
[46:05] there's something special about it when
[46:07] there's a relationship between a husband
[46:08] and a wife and it's
[46:10] such a special relationship that she can
[46:12] say a key word
[46:13] she's telling him a key word to the
[46:14] prophet and he says she don't have to
[46:16] write out the whole thing she just has a
[46:17] word here a word there
[46:18] and i can read between the lines and
[46:20] know what she's telling me
[46:23] he said and i know what she's talking
[46:25] about i can read between the lines
[46:27] now there's a whole lot of that in this
[46:29] great love story of the bible
[46:32] read between the lines let's look in
[46:35] hosea if we could
[46:36] chapter 1.
[46:42] the word of the lord came to hosea the
[46:45] son of berea
[46:46] during the reign of uzziah jotham
[46:49] ahaz hezekiah king of judah and during
[46:52] the reign of jeroboam son of joe
[46:53] joe hash king of israel the beginning of
[46:57] the word of the lord by
[46:59] hosea and the lord said to hosea go
[47:02] and take unto thee a wife of whoredoms
[47:06] and children of whoredoms for the land
[47:08] hath committed great whoredom
[47:10] departing from the lord let's just go
[47:12] before the lord in prayer
[47:14] heavenly father we're thankful lord to
[47:15] be in your house this morning
[47:17] lord we're thankful for a group of
[47:19] people a house of people that's come
[47:21] this morning
[47:22] inspecting lord and lord you can hear it
[47:24] in their voices and their worship and in
[47:26] their praise lord and
[47:27] they're they're expecting something from
[47:29] you lord and lord if we come expect them
[47:31] we know that you're
[47:32] a deliverer lord that you will bring
[47:34] delivery of the word lord that will sink
[47:37] down into our hearts and draw us close
[47:38] to you lord
[47:39] and as these thoughts we look at today
[47:41] lord if there's anything in our lives
[47:43] lord that
[47:44] that we would feel we're falling short
[47:46] upon anything in our lives lord as these
[47:48] words go forth today that we're guilty
[47:49] of
[47:50] lord maybe you just find favor in your
[47:52] eyes lord and forgive us of where we
[47:54] fail you lord
[47:55] because we want to be guiltless up on
[47:57] that day lord when when we come before
[47:59] there and the rapture takes place we
[48:00] don't want anything holding us back lord
[48:02] anything that would tie us to this world
[48:04] or to this earth or to the any of the
[48:06] the demonic things that go on in this
[48:08] world lord so we ask for that
[48:10] deliverance today lord
[48:11] lord we just want to tell you we love
[48:12] you and we appreciate you and just give
[48:14] all glory and honor unto you in jesus
[48:16] name
[48:17] and the bride said amen you can have
[48:20] your seats
[48:21] i want to speak to you this morning if i
[48:24] could for
[48:24] a few minutes on the greatest love story
[48:28] the greatest love story
[48:31] now we as human beings we are captain
[48:34] john michael you're smiling for
[48:36] the greatest love story we as human
[48:39] beings are captivated
[48:41] by a good love story it's just something
[48:44] that draws us to it we tend to like the
[48:46] storyline when boy meets girl or girl
[48:48] meets boy
[48:49] and they fall in love and there's
[48:51] something they see something special
[48:52] about one another
[48:53] and there's something that they go and
[48:55] they just can't be separated you can't
[48:57] pull them apart they're just
[48:58] so in love with one another and we are
[49:01] intrigued by that
[49:02] that they may go through ups and downs
[49:04] and valleys there may be things that
[49:06] that as they're dating important that
[49:08] they may be disappointments that come
[49:10] along the way
[49:11] but there's something in it about each
[49:13] other that they just can't let each
[49:14] other go
[49:15] and we know that at the end they're
[49:17] going to live happily ever after
[49:20] we love a happy ending we love a happy
[49:24] ending the good thing is
[49:25] that in this book we have the bible and
[49:28] we know that there is an
[49:29] ending in this book and in this book we
[49:32] know the ending we
[49:33] know we win it's a happy ending for the
[49:35] bride of christ and christians around
[49:37] the world
[49:41] so if i were to ask you this morning
[49:44] what is the greatest love story
[49:47] maybe if i were to ask the english
[49:48] theologian or somebody in that
[49:51] profession there they would say romeo
[49:52] and juliet
[49:54] romeo and juliet may be one of the
[49:55] greatest love stories of all time you've
[49:57] got young
[49:58] man young woman so in love divided by
[50:00] kingdoms
[50:01] but yet can't find themselves apart they
[50:03] love each other so much that they're
[50:04] willing to die
[50:05] so that the other never has to live
[50:07] without each other what a love story
[50:10] and you say well maybe it's the latest
[50:12] movie that hallmark puts out
[50:15] there's a happy ending there right
[50:17] hallmark never puts out a movie with
[50:19] that unhappy ending
[50:23] maybe you would answer that it's adam
[50:26] and eve
[50:27] and we find adam in the very beginning
[50:29] when god comes down he creates adam and
[50:31] he pulls him out of the dust of the
[50:32] earth and he builds man and the prophet
[50:34] said there stood atom
[50:35] with his toes in the ground like roots
[50:37] and he stands solid
[50:39] and god pulls a pulls from adam and
[50:41] makes himself a wife
[50:42] eve and that there was such a love
[50:44] relationship there
[50:46] that would happen in the garden of eden
[50:47] adultery but adam stands beside his wife
[50:50] and says
[50:50] i will take it too so you don't have to
[50:53] go through it
[50:54] that's a love story maybe it's when
[50:57] jesus christ
[50:58] you look at and you say maybe it's jesus
[50:59] christ is the greatest love story
[51:01] on the cross when he died that is the
[51:04] greatest love story that we can think
[51:06] but brothers and sisters for the bride
[51:08] of jesus christ
[51:10] there is even a greater love story than
[51:12] that
[51:14] the bride of jesus christ has a special
[51:17] calling a special elected group of
[51:20] people from the foundation of the world
[51:22] where god placed in them
[51:23] a predestinated seed and god says i love
[51:26] you through it all
[51:31] now this is where we're going to get
[51:33] sticky and some of my
[51:35] denominational friends would probably
[51:36] beg to differ with me
[51:39] there are many christians in this world
[51:42] there are many christians in this world
[51:45] but being a christian does not make you
[51:47] the bride of jesus christ
[51:51] being a christian does not make you the
[51:53] bride jesus christ
[51:54] accepting christ as your savior does not
[51:57] give you the ticket to the rapture there
[52:01] is a
[52:01] hidden mystery there is a hidden mystery
[52:04] that is only known through
[52:06] faith brother brown said it's through
[52:08] faith it's right there in the faith
[52:10] in that holy spirit it's the holy ghost
[52:12] filled believer
[52:14] that takes the rapture you know there's
[52:17] christians
[52:19] throughout the world that believe
[52:20] because they go to church
[52:23] and i say christians i'm talking
[52:25] christians i'm talking message
[52:26] christians baptist christians methodist
[52:28] christians
[52:29] christians they because they go to
[52:32] church
[52:33] they pay their tithes they give their
[52:35] offerings they maybe serve on the deacon
[52:37] board
[52:38] they do this that and the other all
[52:42] these things
[52:44] they think that they're going in a
[52:46] rapture
[52:48] there's a confusion there somebody's
[52:50] confused there and sometimes we even
[52:52] hear it amongst message people
[52:53] we intertwine and we use the message
[52:55] when we say bride and church and
[52:58] christian and believer all these words
[52:59] tied together but what does that really
[53:01] mean when we break it down
[53:03] because these people if they're not
[53:05] filled with the holy ghost
[53:08] they can serve on all the deacon boards
[53:10] they want
[53:12] if these people are not filled with the
[53:13] holy ghost they can give tithes
[53:15] every day endless they may be blessed
[53:18] sure blessings will come in because
[53:19] they're doing their duty
[53:20] but that does not mean that they're
[53:23] going to take a rapture
[53:28] and answers brother brown was asked
[53:32] will only those who have the baptism of
[53:33] the holy ghost be in the rapture
[53:35] of the church or will all believers be
[53:37] indicated
[53:40] so let's just kind of i'm not changing
[53:42] what he said let's just change the word
[53:44] so we can understand
[53:45] more what the question was let's just
[53:47] read it this way
[53:48] if only those who have the baptism well
[53:51] only those who have the baptism of the
[53:52] holy ghost
[53:53] be in the rapture of the church or will
[53:56] all christians
[53:58] be indicated let's read it that way
[54:01] so let's look at what john 3 16 says
[54:03] very familiar scripture we know it
[54:04] for god so loved the world that he gave
[54:06] his only begotten son but whosoever
[54:08] believeth in him should not perish but
[54:10] have everlasting life
[54:13] what's to say next for god sent not his
[54:15] son into the world to condemn the world
[54:17] but that the world through him might be
[54:20] saved
[54:21] he that believeth on him is not
[54:23] condemned
[54:26] here we still haven't said anything
[54:27] about the holy ghost
[54:29] he that believeth on him is not
[54:30] condemned but he that believeth not is
[54:32] condemned already because he hath not
[54:34] believed in the name
[54:36] of the only begotten son of god so
[54:39] listen the way brother brown
[54:40] answers this question now he says we
[54:43] ain't got time to justify it
[54:45] but only the holy ghost bride
[54:48] will be in the rapture the others won't
[54:52] be lost
[54:54] look he said who's going to judge the
[54:56] earth the saints daniel said
[54:58] daniel said i saw him coming to an
[55:00] ancient time and he came with ten
[55:01] thousands times ten thousands of his
[55:03] saints is that right the rapture of the
[55:05] church had gone
[55:06] and they come down and judgment was set
[55:08] and the books were
[55:09] opened is that right and another book
[55:11] was open it was the book of life the
[55:13] sanctified believer that hadn't received
[55:16] the holy ghost he said didn't jesus
[55:19] teach that ten virgins went out to meet
[55:21] the bridegroom
[55:22] all of them were virgin pure and holy
[55:27] these five didn't get the holy ghost
[55:31] these five had the holy ghost the oil
[55:34] and their lamp
[55:36] now during this time we ought to
[55:38] understand that during that time of a
[55:39] marriage ceremony there was a there was
[55:41] a march a wedding march that took place
[55:43] and so everybody that came virgins and
[55:45] so forth they came and they would bring
[55:47] lamps with them and it was their
[55:48] responsibility to have oil in their
[55:50] lamps whether it was a
[55:51] a small lamp or a twig a stick whatever
[55:53] they were going to march
[55:54] the bride and the bridegroom through the
[55:56] street when the bridegroom
[55:57] made his call so here they were waiting
[56:00] in this scene we can imagine
[56:02] these virgins are sitting there waiting
[56:04] and there's they fall asleep
[56:07] they fall asleep five prepared five
[56:11] unprepared
[56:13] then the bridegroom calls out and they
[56:16] say oh let us go in
[56:18] and then what do they say give us some
[56:19] of your oil
[56:22] no you're not getting my
[56:25] oil this is my god my holy ghost
[56:29] my all that i have worked for i s i
[56:32] prepared for this ceremony
[56:34] and here are these five that wanna they
[56:36] wanna go get oh and they can't
[56:37] and brother brown said that the virgins
[56:39] the virgins the five
[56:40] the five that were prepared went into
[56:42] the wedding supper
[56:47] he goes on to say it this way breaking
[56:49] it down he says to you women
[56:52] and i always liked it when i read this
[56:54] quote years for years now
[56:55] he says to you women when you lay down a
[56:58] pattern
[56:59] and it's a nice piece of goods he says
[57:02] it's the same goods
[57:04] in it and you take it like this and you
[57:07] lay your pattern this way
[57:08] and you're going to cut it you're going
[57:10] to cut the pattern out
[57:12] of the fabric he said you cut the
[57:14] garment out
[57:15] and the rest of it is used sometime or
[57:18] another you're going to use it whether
[57:19] it's piecing together a quilt or
[57:20] whatever women are going to use it he
[57:22] said
[57:22] it's just as good as the goods as the
[57:24] rest of it but by election
[57:28] you chose how you wanted that pattern to
[57:30] look on what you were making
[57:32] by election you chose that he said and
[57:35] this the rest of it is just as holy and
[57:37] just as good and just as expensive
[57:38] but it was your choice and god has
[57:41] promised that we're going in the rapture
[57:43] by
[57:43] election and the rest of the dead live
[57:47] not for a thousand years is that right
[57:49] he said he'll not be lost
[57:50] but the holy ghost bride will go in the
[57:54] rapture the rest of them will come
[57:56] through the judgment
[57:58] bride christian
[58:02] are you with me
[58:05] now we look at hosea this is where we're
[58:08] going to get to
[58:09] get into where the rubber meets the road
[58:16] so the lord began to speak to hosea and
[58:19] the lord says to this man this prophet
[58:21] of god
[58:23] go and take into yourself an adulterous
[58:25] wife
[58:28] and a wife and with children of
[58:30] unfaithfulness
[58:32] what scandal that would be what scandal
[58:35] that is if god comes down to this man
[58:38] a man of god and is told to go find a
[58:40] promiscuous
[58:41] wild woman
[58:44] and marry her
[58:47] well it's quiet
[58:51] brother ben said he could hear a pin
[58:52] drop i hear crickets
[58:56] god tells this man to go find the
[58:57] wildest promiscuous woman that you can
[59:00] find and marry her
[59:01] and we begin to look at this and we
[59:03] realize how in the world could this be
[59:05] how could this be and then we realized
[59:07] that the pain
[59:08] involved would cause us to have such
[59:10] sympathy on hosea and for god
[59:13] because god is telling this holy man go
[59:16] marry a woman with a bad
[59:17] reputation a reputation for
[59:19] unfaithfulness
[59:21] go marry a woman who is going to break
[59:24] your
[59:28] heart
[59:31] no will never be faithful to you
[59:35] go and marry a woman that is by her
[59:38] nature her own wicked nature is
[59:40] certainly going to commit
[59:42] adultery on you
[59:47] anybody ever read this before
[59:54] go pick the vilest woman
[59:57] that is destined to cause you
[1:00:00] endless frustration and grief
[1:00:06] so the obvious question we look at this
[1:00:08] and we say
[1:00:09] why in the world would a prophet be
[1:00:11] called to marry a woman
[1:00:13] such as this what would compel
[1:00:16] god to do such a thing
[1:00:19] can you imagine how he must have felt
[1:00:22] getting the
[1:00:23] the word the vision the word of the lord
[1:00:25] as a prophet
[1:00:26] and god compelling him to do such as
[1:00:29] this
[1:00:32] here's where we have to read between the
[1:00:34] lines as the prophet said in that love
[1:00:36] we have to read between the lines we
[1:00:38] have to look here and deep
[1:00:39] and interpret what this love story is
[1:00:42] because the bible tells us that in the
[1:00:44] land it was the
[1:00:44] it was the guilty and violence of
[1:00:46] adultery and they had departed from the
[1:00:48] lord so he married gomer the daughter of
[1:00:51] diblaine
[1:00:52] and she conceived and bury him a son and
[1:00:55] no doubt they were still even though
[1:00:56] israel at that time was as vile
[1:00:58] as vile could be there were still some
[1:01:01] men of integrity some men of god some
[1:01:03] other prophets and priests and so forth
[1:01:05] that had to come up to hosea and say
[1:01:07] hosea
[1:01:08] you're very respected amongst the
[1:01:10] community you're very respected about
[1:01:12] god and people of god
[1:01:15] how could you do this you how could you
[1:01:17] how could you
[1:01:18] uh take and live such a life as this
[1:01:21] you're held with high
[1:01:22] esteem your wife is a disgrace
[1:01:32] what kind of decisions are you making
[1:01:35] what are you thinking
[1:01:40] i can picture hosea standing there
[1:01:42] offended
[1:01:44] i can picture him offended and maybe ask
[1:01:46] him the better question isn't why am i
[1:01:48] married to a woman like that
[1:01:51] but why is such a good and loving god
[1:01:53] married to an adulterous people like
[1:01:55] you you see that i see what's happening
[1:01:59] now
[1:02:01] see what's happening now hosea was
[1:02:03] married to an adulterous woman because
[1:02:05] god
[1:02:06] was married to an adulterous people
[1:02:09] and god had to do what was taken place
[1:02:12] at the time
[1:02:13] so by hosea's harlot harlot running
[1:02:16] around with all these other men
[1:02:17] they were showing israel that they were
[1:02:19] doing the same thing with other gods
[1:02:22] they were in idolatry they were learning
[1:02:25] with idols and in god's eyes
[1:02:27] they were doing the very same thing so
[1:02:29] he was an eye opener look at what you're
[1:02:31] doing
[1:02:32] you're pointing your fingers at hosea
[1:02:34] but you are living the very
[1:02:35] same life well
[1:02:44] at that point in time israel had all
[1:02:47] their priorities
[1:02:48] out of order they're all out of or
[1:02:52] out of order and idolatry was up there
[1:02:54] at the top of the list
[1:02:56] and let me tell you brothers and sisters
[1:02:57] idolatry can be subtle
[1:03:00] idolatry can be so subtle and the more
[1:03:03] subtle it is the more dangerous it is
[1:03:05] because we can't even see the dividing
[1:03:07] power
[1:03:11] we can't even see the dividing power and
[1:03:13] we got to be careful that we don't fall
[1:03:15] into those same traps of idolatry
[1:03:18] because it's so easy to do even if
[1:03:20] you're the elected
[1:03:22] bride of christ
[1:03:28] our jobs begin to separate us from jesus
[1:03:34] it becomes important to succeed in life
[1:03:36] that you begin to trust in your own
[1:03:38] efforts your own abilities to provide
[1:03:40] for your family
[1:03:41] and now all of a sudden trusting in god
[1:03:43] becomes obsolete
[1:03:49] you get so consumed with
[1:03:53] life with your job
[1:03:56] that you completely separated from jesus
[1:04:02] we begin to live out our hobbies
[1:04:05] everybody got a hobby you need a hobby
[1:04:08] it just don't need to be before god
[1:04:12] everybody needs a hobby but not before
[1:04:14] god because
[1:04:15] one thing you know you begin to separate
[1:04:17] your life of christ
[1:04:19] with the things you want to go do for
[1:04:20] fun and entertainment
[1:04:23] that's what these people were doing fun
[1:04:25] and entertainment
[1:04:28] let me reword it a little bit this
[1:04:30] morning oh and our desires
[1:04:32] our wants our cravings are on ourselves
[1:04:38] separation and divide
[1:04:41] and what does satan want to do he wants
[1:04:44] to divide and conquer
[1:04:45] the more satan can get between you
[1:04:48] and christ the happier he is
[1:04:52] he's working day and night 24 7 365
[1:04:57] on you
[1:05:01] he's got he's got weapons that don't
[1:05:03] just pick out uh
[1:05:04] he just don't point at one person at a
[1:05:05] time he does that
[1:05:07] but he can point at the whole world at
[1:05:10] one time and focus on that
[1:05:12] one individual whatever your weakness is
[1:05:14] whatever your love is
[1:05:16] whatever your desire is he will find it
[1:05:26] you say well that's not me i don't even
[1:05:28] fish i don't hunt i don't golf i don't
[1:05:30] play sports
[1:05:30] i have any hobbies
[1:05:34] i don't really focus on my work i go to
[1:05:36] my job
[1:05:38] we read thousands of texts
[1:05:43] and emails and we text thousands
[1:05:46] of messages a week
[1:05:51] this right here
[1:05:55] is one of the biggest idols in the world
[1:05:59] and if you don't believe me check your
[1:06:01] hours check and see how many
[1:06:03] hours you're on this thing if you if you
[1:06:06] leave home and you you drive 50 miles
[1:06:08] and you find out you forgot it you'll
[1:06:10] turn around and drive 50 back
[1:06:12] to go get it because oh my goodness i'm
[1:06:14] lost without this thing i've got to have
[1:06:15] this phone
[1:06:18] see we all have something that we can
[1:06:20] put as an idol
[1:06:21] and we have to be careful i have to be
[1:06:23] careful my kids they get them dad you
[1:06:25] got to quit texting and driving
[1:06:26] you're going to kill somebody
[1:06:31] yeah i know i know i know but it was
[1:06:33] work it was from your mama
[1:06:35] it was from this that's not an excuse
[1:06:38] and i've got to do better because i'll
[1:06:41] begin to put this before things that
[1:06:42] really matter
[1:06:46] brothers and sisters what happened what
[1:06:49] happened to our first
[1:06:50] love what happened to our first love
[1:06:55] why is it when these things get in front
[1:06:57] of us we ought to be able to see the red
[1:06:58] light flashing stop
[1:07:00] stop stop stop stop
[1:07:03] but we don't do that what happened to
[1:07:05] our first love
[1:07:08] jesus speaks about it in the scriptures
[1:07:10] and he says i have somewhat against thee
[1:07:12] and what was it you have lost your first
[1:07:16] love so ask yourself do you love jesus
[1:07:19] today as much as you did
[1:07:21] five years ago ten years ago
[1:07:25] and when i'm pointing at you i got three
[1:07:26] pointing back at me
[1:07:29] because i look back at my life and i
[1:07:30] think man i have really truly if i'm
[1:07:33] honest with myself i've lost
[1:07:35] some zeal i haven't lost my love for god
[1:07:38] i love god more than i ever have
[1:07:40] and i depend on him more than i ever
[1:07:42] have and i trust any more than i ever
[1:07:43] have but my zeal
[1:07:45] and my passion and my love that i had
[1:07:47] when i was 16
[1:07:48] and brother daniel williams baptized me
[1:07:50] and brother brian and sister jeanette's
[1:07:51] swimming pool in the cold winter as
[1:07:55] zeal is not there it's your zeal there
[1:08:01] oh me it's okay you can say it oh
[1:08:05] me
[1:08:08] what happens to that
[1:08:11] brother i'm saying that fervent desire
[1:08:13] to please god
[1:08:15] the passion to know his word the cry
[1:08:19] for the reaching out of the spirit it
[1:08:20] all begins to fade
[1:08:23] and instead of that church being on fire
[1:08:25] with the fire of god
[1:08:27] it's cooled off and become a bit
[1:08:30] formal
[1:08:34] i don't know if it happens with age i
[1:08:37] don't know if the newness wears off
[1:08:39] but it begins to fade away and it be and
[1:08:41] then you find yourself being formal
[1:08:43] and he says that's what happened back
[1:08:45] there to the ephesians
[1:08:47] he said they were getting a bit formal
[1:08:48] they abandoned the abandonment to god
[1:08:51] was a dying out and the people were
[1:08:54] weren't too careful about what god
[1:08:56] thought of them as they began to
[1:08:58] uh to be careful about what the world
[1:09:00] thought of them
[1:09:04] so they didn't worry too much about what
[1:09:05] god thought anymore they worried about
[1:09:07] what the world thought they thought
[1:09:09] about what their boss thought they
[1:09:10] thought about what
[1:09:11] the people they hung out with thought
[1:09:16] they demanded a king to be like the
[1:09:18] other nations when they did that they
[1:09:20] rejected god but they did it anyway
[1:09:23] that's the history of the church when it
[1:09:25] thinks more of conforming to the world
[1:09:27] instead of
[1:09:28] conforming to god it isn't long until
[1:09:30] you see them stop
[1:09:31] doing the things they used to do and
[1:09:34] start doing
[1:09:35] things they wouldn't do initially
[1:09:40] satan creeping in he's creeped into he's
[1:09:44] crept into our church
[1:09:47] not just ours churches around the world
[1:09:51] our message is on fire like they were in
[1:09:54] the 60s
[1:09:55] 50s 60s i didn't see anybody lined up to
[1:09:59] get in this morning
[1:10:02] i didn't see anybody fighting to get to
[1:10:03] the front row
[1:10:06] well it's the truth they get likes
[1:10:10] and he said that's what ephesus means
[1:10:12] drifting
[1:10:14] so brothers and sisters what would jesus
[1:10:16] say jesus would say
[1:10:18] you're just running to the world like
[1:10:20] gomer runs to her lovers
[1:10:22] and you dare say that you love me
[1:10:28] so in the next chapter we see the story
[1:10:30] and we see god's pain
[1:10:31] and his anger and our false hope and
[1:10:35] those other things that will never
[1:10:36] satisfy
[1:10:39] and gomer was definitely a woman who was
[1:10:41] looking for love
[1:10:43] in all the wrong places that's an old
[1:10:46] song
[1:10:46] some of you probably heard it old
[1:10:48] country song
[1:10:50] but she was looking for love in all the
[1:10:52] wrong places
[1:10:54] god says i will not show my love to her
[1:10:56] because they are children of adultery
[1:10:58] their mother has been unfaithful and has
[1:11:01] conceived them in a disgrace
[1:11:03] she said i will go after my lovers watch
[1:11:06] what she says
[1:11:07] my lovers who give me food and water and
[1:11:10] wool
[1:11:11] and linen my oil and my drink
[1:11:17] she was going after people who could not
[1:11:19] only satisfy her needs
[1:11:21] but her desires
[1:11:25] she was going after somebody who could
[1:11:26] give her everything she wanted and her
[1:11:28] children were the product
[1:11:30] of adultery but the thing is she had a
[1:11:33] very good thing going but she wasn't
[1:11:35] aware of it
[1:11:37] she had a loving husband
[1:11:41] she had a good husband at home the whole
[1:11:44] time
[1:11:44] he's shamelessly caring for her
[1:11:47] and the whole time she's chasing her
[1:11:49] boyfriends and frolicking around in
[1:11:51] bad places
[1:11:56] she thought her lovers were going to
[1:11:57] take care of her they were going to
[1:12:00] provide for her
[1:12:00] they were going to protect her when her
[1:12:02] husband did all those things for her
[1:12:05] are you saying a picture between the
[1:12:07] christian life and
[1:12:09] god are you seeing the correlation there
[1:12:12] there's something that happens there
[1:12:14] brother sisters we get all kinds of gods
[1:12:16] and we begin to fight for the they fight
[1:12:18] for the throne in our hearts
[1:12:20] comfort money fashions pleasures
[1:12:24] legalism
[1:12:25] that's a big one legalism people around
[1:12:28] this message can't have love because
[1:12:29] they're so full of legalism
[1:12:33] they can't love somebody who's down
[1:12:36] somebody a christian who's failing a
[1:12:37] christian who's a gomer
[1:12:41] because they're so legalistic that they
[1:12:43] only see how good they are
[1:12:46] they forget from where they came might i
[1:12:49] say
[1:12:58] how do we know what's getting a grip on
[1:12:59] us
[1:13:01] as believers as bride as christians how
[1:13:04] do you know in your life what's getting
[1:13:06] a grip on you
[1:13:07] let me let me give you some things what
[1:13:11] do you sacrifice for
[1:13:16] what do you sacrifice for what do you
[1:13:19] give up
[1:13:21] paychecks for what do you give up time
[1:13:24] with your family
[1:13:25] for
[1:13:29] what makes you mad
[1:13:33] when things don't go right at work okay
[1:13:36] bar the doors
[1:13:39] what is it makes you mad when things
[1:13:41] don't go right in your business and
[1:13:42] nothing seems to be flowing and you get
[1:13:44] so mad
[1:13:45] about are you putting your business
[1:13:46] before god because you're awful mad
[1:13:48] about something that god's in complete
[1:13:49] control over
[1:13:54] what do you worry about
[1:14:00] you know i found out in life as i've
[1:14:02] gotten older
[1:14:04] a lot of things that i that i used to
[1:14:05] worry about they're insignificant
[1:14:09] they don't matter the only thing that
[1:14:11] matters is
[1:14:12] between me and god i've had things go
[1:14:15] wrong in business and people around me
[1:14:17] get frustrated and
[1:14:18] and they throw their hands and think
[1:14:19] what are you going to do what are you
[1:14:20] going to do we got to do this we got to
[1:14:22] do that they don't have this they don't
[1:14:23] have that
[1:14:23] especially during this covet and i said
[1:14:26] it'll be all right and they look at me
[1:14:29] like i'm a lunatic
[1:14:32] but it'll be okay it'll be all right
[1:14:36] because my god said he would never leave
[1:14:38] me nor forsake me
[1:14:39] he'll be with me even in me to the end
[1:14:41] of the world so what have i got to worry
[1:14:43] about
[1:14:44] if i'm doing what i'm supposed to do
[1:14:47] but what are you wanting to applaud you
[1:14:50] and i praise you
[1:14:53] are you looking for that promotion at
[1:14:55] work
[1:14:57] you're wanting that praise you're
[1:14:59] wanting that applaud
[1:15:04] these things these people
[1:15:07] they're going to steal your affection
[1:15:09] away from god
[1:15:11] if we're not careful god is the only one
[1:15:14] that gives us love
[1:15:16] provision protection he warns us that
[1:15:18] he's the one that can take it away
[1:15:22] every good and perfect gift is from
[1:15:24] above and yet his people
[1:15:26] who call themselves his people go
[1:15:27] looking for love and happiness and joy
[1:15:29] and fulfillment that places where god
[1:15:31] won't even be found
[1:15:39] gomer was a type of a wife
[1:15:43] much like today's church ignores her
[1:15:46] husband
[1:15:50] wishes he wasn't around as much
[1:15:55] isn't it inconvenient when you want to
[1:15:56] do something god's in your ear
[1:16:02] well brother david only me and you has
[1:16:04] ever happened to
[1:16:10] she wishes he was in the ground so she
[1:16:12] could go spend his money and she could
[1:16:14] get all of her gifts and
[1:16:15] she loves the affection of others and
[1:16:21] not not to mention layout of sins
[1:16:28] what do layoff sins love to be called
[1:16:32] christians
[1:16:36] they love to be called christians but
[1:16:39] they hate being married to christ
[1:16:42] you ever thought about that they love to
[1:16:45] be called christians call me a christian
[1:16:46] i'm a lay out this out call me a
[1:16:47] christian i tell you i go to i do this i
[1:16:49] do that
[1:16:50] but when it comes to that real
[1:16:51] relationship that one-on-one
[1:16:55] love of time with god
[1:16:59] to where you're like brother branham
[1:17:01] said i don't want to hurt her so i won't
[1:17:03] do those things
[1:17:09] some people they think well i just want
[1:17:10] to be left alone
[1:17:12] i just want to be left alone you're
[1:17:15] worse off if god leaves you alone
[1:17:18] you will be living a life of hell if god
[1:17:20] leaves you alone
[1:17:21] if god is not dealing with you satan's
[1:17:23] already got you
[1:17:24] and you're setting yourself up for a
[1:17:26] road of failure there'll be people
[1:17:28] thousands
[1:17:28] millions and millions of people that
[1:17:30] walked on the face of this earth
[1:17:32] and said god i want you to leave me
[1:17:33] alone stay out of my life i don't want
[1:17:35] no part of you
[1:17:36] and they will reach up and beg out the
[1:17:38] pits of hell
[1:17:42] that's the reality of it
[1:17:49] the pain that god must feel when we run
[1:17:53] from him
[1:17:54] and we reject him
[1:18:00] when hosea hurt do you think gomer cared
[1:18:08] now she didn't care when he cried out
[1:18:11] for
[1:18:12] she ran from him
[1:18:16] when he loved her she loved other men
[1:18:19] she could care less that's what makes it
[1:18:22] so painful
[1:18:25] can you imagine the pain that god feels
[1:18:28] when he catches us
[1:18:29] sneaking away with some of something
[1:18:31] else
[1:18:33] some other thing some other
[1:18:37] item some other idol can you imagine the
[1:18:40] pain
[1:18:41] that god feels can you imagine what
[1:18:43] would you how would you feel if you were
[1:18:44] sitting there and you saw your one and
[1:18:46] only putting their arms around another
[1:18:48] person
[1:18:51] and embracing that person
[1:18:58] sometimes we try to put things in our
[1:19:00] life
[1:19:02] we try to compartment compartmentalize
[1:19:05] it
[1:19:06] put it into little boxes little
[1:19:07] compartments
[1:19:09] we try to say this is my marriage and
[1:19:11] i'm gonna leave my marriage right over
[1:19:12] here and this is my work right over here
[1:19:15] this is my hobby right over here this is
[1:19:17] my friends and family right over here
[1:19:19] and over here is my christian life
[1:19:23] that's not what god asked us to do
[1:19:26] god doesn't ask us to leave our marriage
[1:19:28] over here all by ourselves
[1:19:30] god wants to be part of everything that
[1:19:32] you're in he wants to be in
[1:19:33] all of your life he wants to be in your
[1:19:36] marriage
[1:19:36] if your husband and wife you need to be
[1:19:38] talking about god you need to be talking
[1:19:40] about the things of god and what god is
[1:19:42] doing in your life
[1:19:43] right at this moment god wants to be a
[1:19:46] part of it god wants to be in your job
[1:19:48] he wants to be in your business he's not
[1:19:50] wanting to go over here and do it on
[1:19:52] your own
[1:19:52] he wants to help you that's what god
[1:19:55] does
[1:19:56] he wants to be in your hobbies he wants
[1:19:58] you to enjoy
[1:19:59] hunting and fishing golfing sports
[1:20:01] baseball whatever it is
[1:20:03] he wants you to enjoy those but he wants
[1:20:05] to be there too
[1:20:17] hosea maybe asked
[1:20:23] gomer maybe asked hosea why are you
[1:20:26] getting all bent out of shape
[1:20:29] why are you getting all bent out of the
[1:20:31] shape i may give my body to others but
[1:20:33] my heart still belongs to you
[1:20:41] brother sisters if her heart belonged to
[1:20:43] hosea
[1:20:44] she wouldn't share her body with other
[1:20:46] men
[1:20:48] and if we would give ourselves all to
[1:20:51] god
[1:20:52] and say that our heart truly belongs to
[1:20:54] god we won't go looking for affections
[1:20:56] in the world
[1:21:03] i don't have to search for approval from
[1:21:04] anybody
[1:21:07] why do we find ourselves sometimes
[1:21:08] thinking we need everybody's approval
[1:21:10] in our life i only need the approval of
[1:21:14] one person
[1:21:15] and that's god almighty he's the one
[1:21:17] that's got my heart i need to prove it
[1:21:19] to him by my actions by the way i live
[1:21:21] by the life i live
[1:21:22] by the words i speak the places i go
[1:21:26] the people i meet
[1:21:29] prove it that way
[1:21:33] imagine if your wife come to you and say
[1:21:34] you know what i'm going to be your
[1:21:36] spouse on mondays
[1:21:37] and thursdays the other five are mine
[1:21:42] yeah you'd look at them cross-eyed
[1:21:45] but why do we do that to god
[1:21:49] i'll be yours on sunday and wednesday
[1:21:53] but the other five are mine
[1:21:57] you know there's a song out right now
[1:21:58] that says what if the church on sunday
[1:22:00] was the church on monday
[1:22:04] wouldn't that make a lot of sense
[1:22:07] why should god have any more importance
[1:22:09] on sunday than he does tomorrow
[1:22:11] but yet we prepare and we get ready and
[1:22:13] we dress up and we
[1:22:15] we come to worship and sing praise god
[1:22:18] he wants that tomorrow too
[1:22:24] i'm guilty i'll be the first to tell you
[1:22:26] i'm guilty
[1:22:28] i have no shame in telling you i i lose
[1:22:30] at that
[1:22:32] i just told my wife this week i said
[1:22:34] we're getting up at five o'clock this
[1:22:36] week
[1:22:38] and we're going to do some things
[1:22:39] different she said 5 30
[1:22:42] i said 5 o'clock
[1:22:46] we'll work it out but we're going to do
[1:22:50] some things different
[1:22:52] we need more time with god
[1:22:57] i need more time with god she needs more
[1:22:59] time with god my kids need more time you
[1:23:01] need more time with god
[1:23:02] make time for god we're in a late late
[1:23:05] hour
[1:23:12] as we go on into this story here
[1:23:18] the groom
[1:23:27] the groom here
[1:23:30] doesn't want the honeymoon to end
[1:23:35] so we think about the church on sunday
[1:23:37] being the church on monday and god
[1:23:38] wanting all of us
[1:23:41] he wants that honeymoon to continue out
[1:23:44] throughout your life
[1:23:46] so that feeling that you had when you
[1:23:48] were 16 20
[1:23:50] 14 12 whatever it was when you first
[1:23:52] came to christ
[1:23:53] and you had this zeal and you was on
[1:23:54] fire and you couldn't wait to pray you
[1:23:56] went to bed praying you woke up praying
[1:23:58] you woke up reading
[1:24:02] you couldn't get enough of god he wants
[1:24:04] that that's the honeymoon and he wants
[1:24:06] that to continue through day through day
[1:24:08] through day through our lives
[1:24:10] not just a phase
[1:24:14] listen to what happens to hosea here
[1:24:19] the bible says god says i will punish
[1:24:21] her for the days
[1:24:23] she burned incense to the to the other
[1:24:25] gods
[1:24:26] she decked herself with rings and
[1:24:28] jewelry and went after her lovers
[1:24:30] but she forgot me
[1:24:37] we've already determined that gomer was
[1:24:38] a a woman of the night
[1:24:42] she was a woman of the night looking for
[1:24:45] love and places and trying to get out
[1:24:47] there to mingle with others and
[1:24:49] while her husband her prophet her
[1:24:50] husband is at home and she's out
[1:24:52] mingling with others
[1:24:54] and the bible says that she forgot
[1:24:58] god now think about this
[1:25:02] immediately in our minds we get angry
[1:25:07] and immediately in our minds we're
[1:25:09] thinking about poor hosea
[1:25:12] and we want revenge this woman is
[1:25:14] treating him
[1:25:15] terrible and so in our minds we begin to
[1:25:18] think we want vengeance we want
[1:25:19] something to take place
[1:25:21] leave her right there if it was your
[1:25:22] friends you would say leave
[1:25:24] her out there get rid of her
[1:25:28] but watch what god says
[1:25:31] he says therefore i am now going to
[1:25:34] allure her
[1:25:38] i will lead her into the desert and
[1:25:39] speak tenderly
[1:25:41] to her isn't that an amazing
[1:25:45] statement isn't that an amazing
[1:25:47] statement like i said if it was our
[1:25:49] friend
[1:25:50] and our friend was standing there and
[1:25:51] you knew that his his wife was treating
[1:25:53] him that way you'd say kick her to the
[1:25:55] curb
[1:25:56] get rid of her leave her let her have
[1:25:58] all those men you don't need her
[1:25:59] anyway forget about it
[1:26:03] but not god god tells hosea to pursue
[1:26:07] her
[1:26:12] we don't see this picture of god often
[1:26:14] do we
[1:26:15] because we think about a god that is
[1:26:18] full of fire
[1:26:20] we think about a god that takes care of
[1:26:22] situations right but god is telling him
[1:26:24] this time
[1:26:25] go win back your lady
[1:26:29] because i'm a god and i'm going to win
[1:26:31] back my
[1:26:32] people he's just like a love struck
[1:26:35] teenager
[1:26:36] he wants to do everything he can to woo
[1:26:38] this young lady of his dreams he can't
[1:26:40] stand the thought of being without her
[1:26:42] he can't stand the thought of her being
[1:26:44] in the arms of another man
[1:26:46] aren't you thankful that god thinks
[1:26:48] about his people that way
[1:26:50] where would each one of us be if god
[1:26:52] didn't say i will go allure you
[1:26:54] back to me
[1:26:58] but we forget don't forget
[1:27:03] don't forget
[1:27:10] in exodus we read that god is a jealous
[1:27:12] god
[1:27:14] he's a jealous husband
[1:27:22] and he's constantly lowering himself to
[1:27:24] win back the affections
[1:27:26] of this adulterous wife
[1:27:32] a wife that is so beneath him
[1:27:35] this whole relationship just looks
[1:27:38] absurd
[1:27:41] and he's trying to win her back
[1:27:47] she's worth everything to him think
[1:27:50] about
[1:27:52] this see the picture now don't don't let
[1:27:55] it get too deep that you can't see
[1:27:56] what's happening
[1:27:58] god is looking out there at his people
[1:28:01] hosea is looking out there at his wife
[1:28:04] the people of god
[1:28:05] are committing all kinds of spiritual
[1:28:07] adultery hosea's wife is committing
[1:28:09] adultery
[1:28:09] but yet they mean everything to
[1:28:12] them
[1:28:16] what kind of love is that that's a love
[1:28:19] that you and i can't understand
[1:28:22] we don't have that kind of love for our
[1:28:24] and for each other
[1:28:26] we give up on each other
[1:28:30] but he's saying she's worth dying for
[1:28:32] even though she humiliated me
[1:28:38] she's worth dying for
[1:28:45] we often hear about and and the bride of
[1:28:47] christ and
[1:28:48] the church being the bride of christ and
[1:28:53] and that kind of reminds me that it's
[1:28:54] about
[1:28:56] not about i'm sorry religion but it's
[1:28:58] about a relationship
[1:29:02] it's about the relationship that we have
[1:29:04] with christ
[1:29:07] you know there's a lot of religious
[1:29:08] people
[1:29:11] there was a lot of religious people in
[1:29:13] jesus name
[1:29:15] so religious so pious so mighty
[1:29:19] they walked above anybody else in the
[1:29:21] streets they were so religious
[1:29:24] so legalistic they knew it all but yet
[1:29:26] they had no love
[1:29:28] in their life
[1:29:33] can you imagine
[1:29:36] as hosea pursues gomer through the
[1:29:39] streets
[1:29:41] as he's pursuing his wife through the
[1:29:43] streets through the dirty streets
[1:29:45] around shady characters and he's going
[1:29:48] to go up to these
[1:29:49] these men these hormones are saying have
[1:29:52] you seen gomer
[1:29:54] have you seen my wife i really like to
[1:29:58] find her
[1:30:00] i really like to talk to her
[1:30:09] listen what the bible says
[1:30:12] the lord said to me go show your love to
[1:30:14] your wife again
[1:30:16] though she is loved by another and as an
[1:30:18] adulteress love her as the lord loves
[1:30:21] the israelites though they turn
[1:30:22] to other gods and love sacred cakes
[1:30:27] so i bought her for 15 shekels of silver
[1:30:31] and about a homer and a left lethal of
[1:30:37] this has to be one of the saddest
[1:30:38] stories i think i've ever read
[1:30:41] into the bible
[1:30:44] isaiah is searching for his wife now a
[1:30:47] prostitute
[1:30:48] owned by somebody else
[1:30:52] ownership she's being sold out
[1:30:56] and here he is coming into a situation
[1:31:00] that just went from bad to worse
[1:31:02] at first she was just running around
[1:31:04] doing her thing doing what she wanted to
[1:31:06] do
[1:31:07] running in the world going here going
[1:31:08] but now she is in a place where she is
[1:31:10] owned by somebody
[1:31:13] and here we see the prophet of god
[1:31:15] standing outside of a brothel
[1:31:18] in a line full of strange men that are
[1:31:21] wanting to pay
[1:31:23] for the affection of his wife
[1:31:28] this is serious business and he's
[1:31:30] standing in the line
[1:31:32] sitting there and says i'm willing to
[1:31:33] pay for the half a price of a slave to
[1:31:36] get my wife back
[1:31:41] you talk about going into some bad
[1:31:43] places to find your love
[1:31:45] he's standing outside this brothel
[1:31:49] what kind of love is this what kind of
[1:31:52] love is this that such a pure and holy
[1:31:54] god
[1:31:55] would go into such a filthy sinful
[1:31:57] people
[1:32:02] and have his prophet stand at the doors
[1:32:04] of a brothel
[1:32:06] and pay for his own wife
[1:32:12] you add up all the totals of what he
[1:32:14] said he was going to pay for his life
[1:32:15] back
[1:32:16] and it equals the sum of money that
[1:32:19] judas was paid
[1:32:20] for the life of jesus
[1:32:24] that's not a coincidence that's
[1:32:27] god using a prophet in his day hosea
[1:32:31] i also pronounced hoshea
[1:32:36] joshua yes the way
[1:32:42] the hebrew name for jesus
[1:32:46] isn't that an amazing story that god's
[1:32:49] love would go into such
[1:32:50] pits of the earth to such dirty and
[1:32:52] filthy place then when you're giving
[1:32:55] yourself to the things of the world
[1:32:57] that god will stand in line for you
[1:33:00] that when you were at your lowest in
[1:33:02] your life god stood in line for you and
[1:33:04] he paid a price
[1:33:06] that no other man could pay for you
[1:33:12] brothers and sisters that's god
[1:33:14] constantly
[1:33:15] dealing with christians
[1:33:19] that's god constantly dealing with
[1:33:21] christians
[1:33:23] what a love is that what kind of love is
[1:33:26] that
[1:33:27] that's the kind of love that says
[1:33:28] brother brown said there will be people
[1:33:30] over there that you never
[1:33:31] dreamed in your life would make it will
[1:33:34] make it
[1:33:38] lord
[1:33:43] there will be people that you never
[1:33:45] dreamed in your life
[1:33:47] make it because of this kind of love
[1:33:52] can you imagine jesus can you imagine
[1:33:55] jesus standing there
[1:33:57] on that day and saying why are you
[1:33:58] chasing over this chasing over here
[1:34:00] chasing over there what are you looking
[1:34:02] for and he wonders
[1:34:02] why are you when are you ever going to
[1:34:04] settle down in your life
[1:34:10] what are you looking for love in those
[1:34:11] places for when i'm the only
[1:34:14] love you need
[1:34:19] that's why it's hard for the bride to
[1:34:20] sometimes believe that some of these
[1:34:22] people are christians
[1:34:26] we got to be careful if you consider
[1:34:27] yourself right and i hope you do
[1:34:30] don't get so heady don't get so haughty
[1:34:34] and how high-minded that you look down
[1:34:37] on people that say they're christians
[1:34:38] and you judge them and say that can't be
[1:34:40] a christian because think back about
[1:34:46] gomer
[1:34:48] she couldn't have been a christian
[1:34:49] because she couldn't have been a
[1:34:51] prophet's wife because
[1:34:53] jesus couldn't go to israel because
[1:34:57] be careful know the difference between
[1:35:00] christian and bride
[1:35:04] there is a love
[1:35:08] a greater love for the bride of jesus
[1:35:11] christ
[1:35:13] there is a special called out group of
[1:35:15] chosen people brothers and sisters
[1:35:17] people that don't run back and forth to
[1:35:19] the world
[1:35:20] now i'm talking to a different group of
[1:35:22] people now we're going to go into a
[1:35:24] different storyline
[1:35:25] because these people find god in their
[1:35:27] jobs these people place god in their
[1:35:30] hobbies
[1:35:30] these people place god in their families
[1:35:33] god is first and foremost as for my
[1:35:35] house we will serve the lord
[1:35:38] that's the kind of people under no
[1:35:40] circumstance do they go to the things of
[1:35:41] the world
[1:35:42] alcohol drugs cigarettes none of those
[1:35:44] things have any kind of pull
[1:35:46] or power on them they don't need any of
[1:35:48] those things
[1:35:50] why because they're filled with the holy
[1:35:51] ghost the holy ghost don't do
[1:35:54] those things
[1:36:00] they are so honed in and in tune with
[1:36:03] the bridegroom
[1:36:05] they're not like that ephesian church
[1:36:07] that forsaken their first love
[1:36:11] don't confuse yourself with first group
[1:36:16] we've all fallen short but there's
[1:36:19] something on the inside
[1:36:21] there's something on the inside that
[1:36:23] tells you that god has a special place
[1:36:26] and there's a special pull between you
[1:36:28] and god
[1:36:30] let me tell you there's going to be
[1:36:31] bride in denominational churches too
[1:36:34] oh boy ain't got no way man's there
[1:36:39] there's gonna be people i feel like i
[1:36:42] know some of those people
[1:36:45] that live so close to god that know not
[1:36:47] one thing about this message
[1:36:51] well
[1:36:55] talk about that one after church
[1:36:59] so honed and tuned in with god
[1:37:03] listen now to another story where
[1:37:04] brother branham's talking
[1:37:07] he's got a few more pages here
[1:37:10] brother branham says
[1:37:16] the bible is a love story of god's
[1:37:19] writing to his children
[1:37:20] do you believe that he said i love my
[1:37:24] wife
[1:37:24] we really got a real love affair she and
[1:37:27] i
[1:37:28] when i go overseas it's a similar story
[1:37:31] we told before a little different word
[1:37:32] and i liked it he says i don't come up
[1:37:34] and say miss branham let me tell you
[1:37:36] something
[1:37:37] thou shalt not have no other husbands
[1:37:40] and she don't say to me yes and my young
[1:37:42] man thou shalt have no other wives
[1:37:44] either
[1:37:45] no he said now that wouldn't be a home
[1:37:51] we're talking about a different kind of
[1:37:52] love now a different kind of love than
[1:37:55] what
[1:37:55] hosea and gomer had a different kind of
[1:37:58] love
[1:37:58] he said she said i'm going to go and she
[1:38:01] said
[1:38:02] she'll get down and pray with me one
[1:38:04] with another
[1:38:05] and says god bless you honey i'll be
[1:38:06] praying for you billy
[1:38:08] and she said i'll see you again
[1:38:09] sweetheart overseas i go
[1:38:12] and that's all there is to it i'll never
[1:38:15] live
[1:38:16] untrue to her
[1:38:19] i will never live untrue to her she want
[1:38:21] with me as long as we love one another
[1:38:24] when you love god you ain't going to
[1:38:28] hurt him
[1:38:34] so the question we have to ask ourselves
[1:38:36] are we living lives
[1:38:38] that hurt god are we living lives
[1:38:42] that hurt god because he says when you
[1:38:44] love god you ain't going to hurt him
[1:38:46] you're going to do everything you can
[1:38:48] that's the main thing in your life is to
[1:38:50] love
[1:38:50] god though i speak with tongues of men
[1:38:53] and angels that have not love i'm
[1:38:55] nothing love
[1:38:59] if you want to follow with me i'm going
[1:39:00] to go to genesis 24 now
[1:39:02] as we turn to another love story
[1:39:14] genesis 24
[1:39:17] and abraham was old and wealth stricken
[1:39:19] in age
[1:39:21] and the lord had blessed abraham in all
[1:39:23] things
[1:39:25] and abraham said unto his eldest servant
[1:39:27] of the house that ruled over all that he
[1:39:29] had
[1:39:30] put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh
[1:39:33] and i will make thee swear by the lord
[1:39:35] the god of heaven
[1:39:36] and the god of earth that thou shalt not
[1:39:39] take a
[1:39:40] wife unto my son of the daughters of the
[1:39:42] canaanites
[1:39:43] among whom i dwell so abraham now
[1:39:47] his wife sarah has died has passed on
[1:39:50] isaac now is leading a wife
[1:39:52] let's set the scene in order and isaac
[1:39:54] is needing a wife
[1:39:55] and and abraham makes uh eliezer make a
[1:39:58] vow with him that you will not find
[1:40:01] somebody that's
[1:40:02] not of our royal blood
[1:40:06] you won't find somebody out there that's
[1:40:09] out of the canaanites
[1:40:10] but you will go to my homeland
[1:40:13] but thou shalt go to my country into my
[1:40:15] kindred and take a wife until my son
[1:40:17] isaac and the servant said unto him
[1:40:20] prayer adventure the woman will not be
[1:40:21] willing to follow me unto this land
[1:40:24] must i needs bring my son again unto the
[1:40:26] land from which thou camest
[1:40:28] and abraham said unto him beware thou
[1:40:31] that thou bring not my son thither again
[1:40:35] the lord of god of heaven which took me
[1:40:37] from my father's house and from the land
[1:40:39] of my kindred
[1:40:40] and which spake unto me and swear unto
[1:40:42] me saying unto thy seed will i give this
[1:40:44] land he shall send his angel
[1:40:48] before thee and thou shalt take a wife
[1:40:52] unto my son from dance and if a woman
[1:40:56] would not be willing to follow thee
[1:40:58] then thou shall be clear from this my
[1:41:00] oath and only bring my son thither again
[1:41:03] and the servant put his hand under the
[1:41:04] thigh of abraham his master and swear
[1:41:07] to him concerning that matter now you
[1:41:10] want to talk about a faith and a love
[1:41:12] that abraham had for his own
[1:41:14] abraham said i want you to go my servant
[1:41:16] i want you to go in
[1:41:17] into the my homeland and i want you to
[1:41:20] find my son
[1:41:21] isaac a wife and i want you to promise
[1:41:24] me
[1:41:24] under no circumstance will you get one
[1:41:26] from any other place
[1:41:28] but i want you to go there and i'm so
[1:41:29] confident that god has told me and
[1:41:32] showed me that the angels of god will go
[1:41:34] before you
[1:41:35] and prepare this place
[1:41:38] my my what a love
[1:41:41] so here we see rebecca one of the
[1:41:44] greatest stories
[1:41:46] of all time in the bible rebecca here
[1:41:53] with his love reciprocating
[1:41:57] eliezer reaches into abraham's home
[1:42:01] homeland and he goes and he's looking
[1:42:03] for this wife
[1:42:05] and he says one of the greatest prayers
[1:42:07] in the entire bible
[1:42:10] now listen to what he says paraphrasing
[1:42:11] psalm
[1:42:13] lord god of my master abraham
[1:42:17] give me success today and show kindness
[1:42:21] to my master
[1:42:22] abraham see i'm standing outside of this
[1:42:26] spring and the daughters of the town's
[1:42:28] people are coming out to draw
[1:42:30] water may it be that when i say
[1:42:33] to a girl please let down your jar that
[1:42:35] i may have a drink
[1:42:37] that she says i will drink and i will
[1:42:40] draw
[1:42:40] water from your camels too let her be
[1:42:43] the one you have chosen for your servant
[1:42:45] isaac by this i will know that you have
[1:42:48] shown kindness
[1:42:50] to my master brothers and sisters before
[1:42:54] eliezer had finished praying
[1:42:58] do you realize that if you look in the
[1:42:59] scriptures he said before he came
[1:43:01] out of my heart there come a damsel
[1:43:04] there come a woman
[1:43:05] there come rebecca out with a jar on her
[1:43:08] shoulder
[1:43:08] here come this beautiful lovely virgin
[1:43:11] girl
[1:43:12] we're not talking about a gomer we're
[1:43:14] talking about a girl that had never been
[1:43:15] with a man
[1:43:16] a girl who was so pure and lily what
[1:43:25] before he finished praying
[1:43:30] she went down to the spring to fill her
[1:43:33] jar
[1:43:36] and eliezer runs over to her to meet her
[1:43:38] and he says please give me a little
[1:43:39] drink from your jar
[1:43:42] and what does she say drink my lord
[1:43:46] drink drink my lord and she lowered her
[1:43:50] jar
[1:43:50] quickly and gave him a drink and after
[1:43:53] she gave him a drink
[1:43:54] what did she say and i will give drink
[1:43:57] to your camels too
[1:43:59] until they have finished drinking so
[1:44:02] here quickly she empties her jar into
[1:44:04] the troll so run back to get more water
[1:44:06] and fill the trough more and more so
[1:44:07] these camels can drink and drink and
[1:44:08] drink
[1:44:09] all along she don't even know who she is
[1:44:11] at this point
[1:44:13] but god has sent eliezer out to find
[1:44:16] a bride
[1:44:20] are you with me god sent eliezer out to
[1:44:24] find a bride
[1:44:25] for his son
[1:44:28] and eliezer prays this great prayer of
[1:44:31] faith
[1:44:33] and god is moving on the scene and
[1:44:36] eliezer
[1:44:38] then goes to rebecca's home and he goes
[1:44:40] there to see rebecca's family and laban
[1:44:42] sitting there and they're discussing the
[1:44:44] possibilities of rebecca becoming the
[1:44:45] bride for isaac
[1:44:47] and they're sitting there and here the
[1:44:48] servant eliezer and all of his
[1:44:50] uh contraband that was with him they
[1:44:52] come and they bring gold and silver and
[1:44:53] all these beautiful clothing to rebecca
[1:44:56] and costly tools and all these items
[1:44:59] and they begin to tell her tell her who
[1:45:01] she is who she will be
[1:45:03] and they eat and they drink and they
[1:45:05] spend the night
[1:45:09] the next morning it says eliezer woke up
[1:45:12] the next morning he said send me on my
[1:45:14] way to my master with her
[1:45:16] the lady said oh wait a minute here
[1:45:21] wait a minute here we're moving this
[1:45:24] engagement up a little fast here aren't
[1:45:26] we
[1:45:27] you just showed up yesterday you're
[1:45:29] paying us with gold and jewels and all
[1:45:31] these nice precious things and you're
[1:45:32] telling us
[1:45:33] about a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:45:35] and you're telling us about all these
[1:45:36] things
[1:45:37] and where you come from and how royal
[1:45:40] you are
[1:45:42] and you go wait i think we slow this
[1:45:43] thing down a little bit
[1:45:46] i think we need to wait about 10 days
[1:45:47] and let her think about this
[1:45:49] he says don't waste my time
[1:45:54] eliezer knew that the love of god had
[1:45:56] called this girl to the well
[1:45:59] eliezer knew that the love of god caused
[1:46:01] that woman
[1:46:02] that the angels had went before her and
[1:46:04] set up the scene that she would say
[1:46:06] here drink from my cup and let me drink
[1:46:08] and feed your camels as well
[1:46:10] let me water your camels as well
[1:46:14] so he said well let's just let the girl
[1:46:16] talk
[1:46:18] let's let her decide so they called her
[1:46:22] in there and they said rebecca
[1:46:24] do you want to go with this man
[1:46:28] and without hesitation i will
[1:46:32] i will there was no doubt in her mind
[1:46:35] she began to realize who she was that
[1:46:38] god had placed something
[1:46:39] in her heart that there was a future
[1:46:41] home waiting for her
[1:46:42] just beyond the hillside a place that no
[1:46:45] other woman could go
[1:46:46] a place that no other person could go
[1:46:48] because they wasn't worthy
[1:46:50] and she was worthy because the angels of
[1:46:52] god set it up that way
[1:46:54] i will
[1:46:58] i will so rebecca and all of her
[1:47:02] handmaids they begin to load up the
[1:47:03] camels with all of their supplies
[1:47:05] and they're riding back to the to
[1:47:07] abraham's place to me to isaac
[1:47:09] and she's riding and i love the story as
[1:47:12] it goes on and i love the way brother
[1:47:14] bill yon sings the song ellie needs to
[1:47:17] tell me more
[1:47:19] we want to know more about my god elies
[1:47:22] are telling me more

[1:47:25] handsome is he tall is he dark
[1:47:27] what color is his eyes oh brothers and
[1:47:31] sisters
[1:47:32] can you imagine what rebecca thought
[1:47:34] when she saw isaac out in the field
[1:47:36] and isaac and she got up and i think the
[1:47:37] prophet said he was just down
[1:47:39] kneeling to pray and he stood up and
[1:47:41] rebecca sees him and she puts that veil
[1:47:43] across her place because she's showing
[1:47:45] she's pure as can be
[1:47:47] she hasn't been with nobody else she's
[1:47:48] not a gomer she's not running through
[1:47:50] the world
[1:47:51] she's i'm pure that's my man
[1:47:59] brother branham said she jumped off that
[1:48:01] camel she run to meet him and it was
[1:48:03] love
[1:48:04] at first sight he said they were
[1:48:07] sweethearts
[1:48:10] brothers and sisters we had our eliezer
[1:48:12] for our day
[1:48:14] do you realize that do you realize that
[1:48:18] we've had our eliezer for our day
[1:48:20] that god sent a prophet in the hour in
[1:48:22] the most darkest hour that there is when
[1:48:24] there's no light left
[1:48:26] and he sent a prophet in this hour to
[1:48:28] come and prepare a bride
[1:48:30] and all the mysteries that the master
[1:48:32] can be made known
[1:48:35] what a love story the greatest love
[1:48:37] story

[1:48:59] love him
[1:49:01] the more he loves me
[1:49:04] the more he gives to me
[1:49:09] this is the evening time brothers and
[1:49:11] sisters
[1:49:12] brother brown said look it was in the
[1:49:13] cool of the evening
[1:49:15] when isaac walked out
[1:49:18] and some people said well if you see him
[1:49:21] you'll know him he's a real dark jew
[1:49:23] and if you see him you'll know him
[1:49:24] because of this and if you see him you
[1:49:26] know him because of that
[1:49:29] and she said i don't care what he looks
[1:49:30] like
[1:49:32] he's my savior i don't care what he
[1:49:35] looks like
[1:49:37] it'll be love at first sight
[1:49:42] the bride of jesus christ is true to the
[1:49:45] word
[1:49:47] the bride of jesus christ is true to her
[1:49:50] god
[1:49:52] she's not running around she's not
[1:49:54] chasing idols
[1:49:56] she's not chasing the dreams and the
[1:49:58] passions of this world
[1:50:01] we've all got to live we know that we
[1:50:03] got to do things to make it through this
[1:50:05] life
[1:50:06] but we need to make sure what we're
[1:50:07] doing is putting christ first
[1:50:11] she's a holy ghost filled bride
[1:50:16] brother brown said what a great thing it
[1:50:18] is today lord
[1:50:19] to know that now we are united with one
[1:50:22] spirit one spirit the holy spirit has
[1:50:25] got the word and his grips
[1:50:27] and it comes in us and what a great
[1:50:31] thing it is what a privilege to cut
[1:50:32] loose from all the world
[1:50:35] and unite ourself to jesus christ
[1:50:38] and to think that someday in a physical
[1:50:40] form with a body like his own glorious
[1:50:42] body
[1:50:43] we'll set down at the table at the
[1:50:45] wedding supper
[1:50:47] and there will be united and wed in
[1:50:50] marriage to him
[1:50:51] and to live as bride and bridegroom
[1:50:55] through all times that is to come
[1:50:58] listen to this through a ceaseless
[1:51:02] eternity can you imagine
[1:51:07] the hand of god the arms of god wrapped
[1:51:10] around you
[1:51:11] in a ceaseless eternity
[1:51:16] don't don't miss it we can't
[1:51:20] miss it we can't we can't lose
[1:51:23] you can't afford to lose
[1:51:26] when i was in nursing school ten years
[1:51:30] ago whatever it was
[1:51:32] it was some of the hardest tests i've
[1:51:33] ever taken in my life
[1:51:36] and you think this is childish
[1:51:37] superstitious whatever you want to call
[1:51:39] it
[1:51:40] but every time there was test day i had
[1:51:42] a university of kentucky t-shirt and at
[1:51:44] that time it said refuse to
[1:51:46] lose
[1:51:51] i wore the shirt to every test
[1:51:55] refuse to lose bride it's testing time
[1:52:00] it's testing time where do we fall at
[1:52:05] to be a christian is a great great thing
[1:52:11] but there's also some hardships that
[1:52:12] come with that
[1:52:14] there's a tribulation that comes with
[1:52:16] that but to be a bride
[1:52:19] to be the bride of jesus christ
[1:52:23] is the greatest love story ever told
[1:52:27] let's stand our feet
[1:52:39] just bow our heads uh musicians if you
[1:52:41] want to make your way up it'll be fine
[1:52:47] all heads bowed and eyes closed
[1:52:54] we've told the tale of two love stories
[1:52:57] both of them
[1:52:58] today were tremendous love stories and
[1:53:00] showed great love and passion
[1:53:02] from god showed love and compassion to a
[1:53:06] people that was running from him a
[1:53:08] people that
[1:53:09] still turned to the things of the world
[1:53:11] of people or a woman who
[1:53:13] lived a life of adultery and
[1:53:16] and lived as a prostitute and was sold
[1:53:19] out
[1:53:20] to the things of the world and that love
[1:53:23] was so great
[1:53:25] that he chased her and he pursued her
[1:53:28] and he
[1:53:28] and he allured her into a place that he
[1:53:30] could say i'm all that you need i'm all
[1:53:32] the love you ever need quit going to the
[1:53:34] things of the world
[1:53:36] if you find yourself in a place this
[1:53:38] morning where you say
[1:53:42] i'm not sure i fit that bride message
[1:53:44] this morning
[1:53:46] of rebecca and a pure
[1:53:50] virgin bride who don't turn to the
[1:53:53] things of the world
[1:53:54] if you find yourself wondering where
[1:53:55] you're at just
[1:53:58] right there you don't have to raise your
[1:53:59] hand just be honest with god and say god
[1:54:04] please draw me close to you
[1:54:08] me in to where the things of the world
[1:54:09] don't allure me no more but that only
[1:54:11] your love is draws me near
[1:54:16] we need that relationship with god
[1:54:19] god needs that relationship with us he
[1:54:22] desires that relationship with us
[1:54:24] he desires a pure bride
[1:54:28] without spot or wrinkle no blemishes
[1:54:34] when the sacrificial lamb was given in
[1:54:36] the old testament
[1:54:37] that lamb had to be without spot or
[1:54:40] wrinkle
[1:54:41] or blemish it had to be
[1:54:45] perfection symbolizing
[1:54:48] as a token for what jesus christ was
[1:54:51] going to do
[1:54:51] on the cross of calvary that an innocent
[1:54:55] lamb
[1:54:59] will take on the sins of the world
[1:55:02] and now that innocent lamb has gone
[1:55:06] he took the sins of the world he made a
[1:55:09] way so that
[1:55:10] you could come back and if you're
[1:55:11] running in a place that such as governor
[1:55:13] was
[1:55:15] but now this lamb is going to come back
[1:55:20] for a bride and just as
[1:55:23] he was without spot or wrinkle she's
[1:55:25] going to have to be without spot or
[1:55:26] wrinkle
[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:29] she needs that token of the holy ghost
[1:55:32] over her life
[1:55:34] the token of the holy ghost is what
[1:55:36] gives you your ticket
[1:55:39] to the rapture brothers and sisters
[1:55:42] you've heard the prophet tell the story
[1:55:44] many times or the person trying to get
[1:55:46] on the
[1:55:46] the tram or the train and they didn't
[1:55:49] have that ticket to punch
[1:55:51] they didn't have that token that token
[1:55:53] wasn't applied to their life
[1:55:55] god apply the holy ghost token to our
[1:55:58] life lord jesus

[1:56:09] we fail you daily lord but it's not our
[1:56:13] desire
