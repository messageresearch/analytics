that your holy spirit would just speak what you once said lord and that your presence would come down father and anoint the word lord and made go into the hearts of the believers father and bring forth a hundredfold lord jesus and that we would go from here a different people than what we've come a better people than what we've come lord knowing father that you have spoken to our hearts and lord we're so glad that we're yours lord we're so glad to be able to sing that song that we're yours lord that means everything to us bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart now in jesus name amen and amen amen i want to take a little subject out of haggai the book of haggai amen i was sitting back here in the pulpit actually back here just reading the scriptures when i came across this when i got to study and that came back on my mind so amen we'll just see what the lord will have for us would that be all right and haggai the first chapter and we want to speak with the help of the lord with those who uh obey the voice of god and those who do not obey the voice of god amen and we want to call it can call it considering consider your ways consider your ways amen haggai one in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the lord by hagia i the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shial theo governor of judah and to joshua the son of jesudek the high priest saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying this people say the time is not come the time that the lord's house should be built then came the word of the lord by hagee i the prophet saying is it time for you o ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways you have sown much and bring in little you eat but ye have not enough you drink but ye are not filled with drink ye clothe you but there is none warm and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it in a bag with holes thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways go up to the mountain and bring wood and built the house and i will take pleasure in it that will be glorified saith the lord he looked too much and lo it came too little he looked for much and lo it came too little when he brought it home i did blow upon it why saith the lord of hosts because when i because my house that is waste and he run every man into his own house therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew and the earth is stayed from her fruit and i called for a drought upon the land upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon a new wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the labor of the hands then zerubbabel the son of xiaotio and joshua the son of jose deck the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the lord their god and the words of haggai the prophet as the lord their god had sent him and the people did fear before the lord then speak haggai the lord's messenger the in the lord's message unto the people saying i am with you saith the lord amen may god had his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated i just read that and there's actually only two chapters in haggai amen and so when i read that i was like wow you know and the lord just seemed to pick something up there that perhaps would be a blessing to us tonight amen and so i think what we have read already spoke volumes to us didn't it it's pretty simple but you know it's rare i want to say it's rare that people actually do verse 12 right when they hear the voice of the lord and actually obey it right you know and so it makes a huge difference amen because the truth of the matter is that's what we're here all here on earth for and that right we're going to either do one or the other thing we're going to obey the voice of god and be blessed or we're going to disobey amen and things are not going to go so well amen the lord can never bless something that is disobedient to his word amen and so we looked at that and i might go back down here just a little bit but uh the prophet of god you know he preached a message thinking on our way you mean there's another scripture that talks about david i think it's as he was thinking on his ways but here it says consider your ways because apparently israel there i believe they were the lord's house had no doubt come to waste somehow i don't know the full story but according to this the house of the lord laid waste and the people said you know it's just not time yet we're not ready to build the lord's house you know and so the lord sent haggai to give him a message you know here he says you know my house lays waste and here you go to your house am i right you go to your sealed houses no doubt your deluxe houses your nice houses you enjoy that but you don't worry about that lord's how now how many knows that's a whole lot like leodocya they're reaching increased with goods they don't think that they have need of anything but don't realize spiritually they're suffering how many knows the layout of scenes they were seriously suffering because they were wretched miserable poor blind naked and didn't know it these people here you know god works interesting intricately in our lives amen and he gets specific god gets specific here with them you know right he says you know you so much but you bring in little i don't know about you but how many has ever been felt like you're just really spinning your wheels you work like who'da thought it but yet you get nowhere you sow a lot but you get no benefits hardly yeah amen and then it says you know but you you have so much and you bring a little in you eat but you don't have enough amen people are never happy with what they do have it's never enough they're still not satisfied then the next is the drink people drink you know they partake of something they drink but their thirst is never quenched amen but you are not filled with drink and then he said that you are clothed you clothed yourself amen but the love of many is wax cold and they're right people are as cold as ever they dress nicer than ever but they're colder inside than they've ever been hey man they might dress good you might have clothes on but you're still cold and that's what leoducia is isn't that right they ought to see they may have the best it may be droves but they're still that's what's on the inside praise be to god amen oh does why they did not build the house of the lord other things their own house and everything else is more important than the house of god now in our world we wouldn't necessarily talk about a tabernacle or a house amen we want to talk about this tabernacle because some of those this is the tabernacle of god and many people they'll tears they love so much they look mad they want the best food they want the best clothes they want the best house but they don't worry about what it looks like when we come to your house and no doubt it's going to be cleaned it's going to be swept it's going to be this thing that the other and you don't want no dog running through the house and get everything all muddy but a lot of times we'll let demons sit us with us in a recliner hello amen it is that or the other when you think about it our natural houses may be purty but why is our spiritual health what's that looking like what is our spiritual steak with the lord i tell you what notice how he talks about the oil and the wine and that right he says you know i'm gonna take out the fruit i'm gonna take out i'm gonna call for a drought and there ain't going to be no stimulation of revelation it's going to be shh oops wrong one quiet in the house of the lord huh no i don't know why no rain coming down now i want you to know something i am a believer that god controls the snow last night he controls the weather he controls whether it rains or whether it doesn't rain the bible clearly states that he is making sure that things get watered how many knows man can you imagine if god didn't see that all of nature and all the trees and everything gets watered well buddy i'll tell you this right now if you left it in the devil's hands we'd have some bad looking place out there it would be terrible but god cares about that and so does god care about you and me he cares about us i'm glad to be serving the living god not just the god of history but we're leaving we're dealing with somebody amen but what he's trying to say is i want you to get together and i want you to build my house build me a temple because he said here amen i will take pleasure in it praise be to god and i will be glorified save the lord now how many knows there's just no glory in a dead temple where there's no life that's right huh we get together and the same thing said over and over and over ritualistic we have a prayer book and we read the prayer every sunday morning huh but god is life and he will be glorified saith the lord i will take pleasure in it amen i like that and we know that we are the temple of god and he wants to be glorified in our temple people they look for much and law just a little bit king oh my let me go back down here so he's noticed and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag of holes now how many knows many of us know the phrase about you know how sometimes our pocket it might get a lot of money in it but it's got a hole in the pipe yeah yeah i don't know about you but he ain't no good to make him a lot of money if you still got the money that's what he said you know you may earn and you may put it all in there but i'm gonna make sure that everything can go wrong will go wrong we all know that a lot of times your savings and so forth hey you just about time you get some money saved up something else the motor blows up in the car you need a new car well there it goes that you know this that or the other but that's what he's saying he's just going to make sure now he knows god cares about his children he's not going to cast you off but he's going to make life rough on you he's not gonna bless you god don't bless those that don't keep his commandments go ahead that's the truth if you want to be blessed do what god says if you want to be cursed go your own way do your own thing do it your way huh it's that simple i want to first dwell on those who disobey okay those who don't fear the lord then i want to go over the haggy eye here where it says the people did fear before the lord they had a reverence how many know that's what this world i oh my i've been a christian i guess 30 somebody i don't even know how many years it's been so many years but i never get i never cease to get amazed how god is so great i mean to make the stars out there the moon the galaxies everything that there is including me and being so nice that he chose me to live isn't that right so nice you know praise be to god and the power the sheer power that god has the sheer powerful knowledge that he has the wisdom that he has the perfection that he is he never ceases to amaze me i guess the best way to explain it is that song says i stand i stand in all of you just stand there in awe of him like wow amen and he is worthy to be praying how did he's always been always will be he's ever present god he's not just a god of history but he's a god of today and the graciousness of god the mercy of god it's just i don't know about you brother glenn but i didn't stop this thing a long time ago we wouldn't have got this far they wouldn't have got this far he wouldn't have to let him go this far he'd be righteous to judge the world with the first or second offense you know that and then you know what else you know what else is the grace of almighty god i wouldn't even have let me go that far all right you don't think so yeah we're that way we like to judge each other quick we don't let each other get away with too much before we get judgmental and cannot get all condemnation about him god is a whole lot more forgiving than what we are he's the most forgiving god his mercy endureth forever and he watches us and he knows our hearts and he knows and everything we do and every time we repent amen he knows is that right he's merciful god the most merciful god is that you can ever imagine i thank you for that because i wouldn't stand a chance and neither with you amen but god is a gracious god okay so praise be to god so i'll tell you what man i'll tell you more you just because even jesus said in the new testament remember jesus said in the new testament you know i will liken you know the kingdom of god to a man who built this house upon the rock isn't that right and then he talks about those who keep his commandments are like the man that built upon a rock and those that don't keep his commandments are those who build the pond's hand amen because the winds are going to come and it's going to blow that house down but the one that doeth the will of heart of the father amen that obeys his commandment he's going to build his house upon a rock and then the fear of god is beginning of smarts it's the beginning of wisdom amen you are a fool bible says to say there ain't no god only a fool you are stupid beyond imagination well my version of it anyway praise be to god god is good you love him tonight he is awesome all right so let's think about this they feared the lord and the lord came back with haggy eye amen and they listened to the lord they obeyed his voice let me tell you something you know how many knows that god sent a gift one time through solomon and the people accepted that gift accepted god and they're right and they had the most greatest time that the world had probably ever known all the nations of the world feared israel why because not even the enemy and not even the kings of the enemy remember that one case where he says you know how does he know that i do this or said that and the prophet told that king he says you know he knows what goes on in your bed chambers that little conversation you and your wife have on your pillar when you haven't talked about it and i didn't think that he heard all that he knew all about it and they feared god it was a glorious age it is a glorious time for any individual that will do what god says it's that simple if it tells you you need to repent and get baptized buddy i'll tell you what how deep some water because i'm thinking take a dive huh get me in the water that's right because that's what god said he don't believe us shall be saved he not believeth not chubby damn amen obey the voice of god oh boy after tonight's service take this home amen and think about this tomorrow that if you really want joy unspeakable and blessings beyond your imagination do what god said you know saul he was he had mercy and grace shown to him they chose him to be king isn't that right but he thought it was better to bring all those sheep and the oxen back and sacrifice to god when god says destroy everything and samuel said no no no no saul god loves obedience a lot better than sacrifice i mean he knows that god loves obedience boy you talk about a rebellious generation a world we're living in and you know what the thing of it is the thing of it is not a one person is gonna get away with anything nobody's gonna get away with nothing you mock god all you want but it's coming back to you it's coming back to you all right so we'll pick this back up let's go to proverbs let's talk about another group that did not choose the fear of the lord amen that wanted to walk in their own way proverbs 1 and verse 23 turn you at my reproof see there and had yeah they actually turn and boy were they blessed and we are going to have a jew believe when we find out what god gave them as a reward for turning turn you at my reproof behold i will pour my spirit upon you and i will make known my words unto you aren't you glad in this hour that god does have a voice god does have words god does have instruction oh and it's so clear brother branham in his meetings he would many times he would preach the gospel and he'd be waiting for him to come right all of a sudden say he's here now the lord he's here now huh and i just listened to a tape after he says you know he's the angel of the lord he showed himself to him he was a tall dark man with hair down to her shoulder length somewhere he says it's the same one that uses my voice to speak and he saw him huh so you see folks how many knows we have a clear voice of god in this generation and even he said this voice the messages the tapes they will be played back on the day of judgment amen ah they might dispute it but he's gonna say then why did god pack it up god why did he vindicate it right afterwards god wouldn't have indicated back up something that's false no he wouldn't now though i will make known my words unto you because i have called and you refused i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded i mean that was over revelations he said i stand at the door that put him outside they refused him they rejected him you know what's waiting for that group atomic fire weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth you don't just reject the lord put him outside and not expect to get your reward i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded you have said it not all my counsel and would none of my reproof i also will laugh at your calamity i will mock when your fear cometh and when your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you oh my can i just stop a minute it comes to mind over in the book of revelations i believe it is it says hold on a second okay and the four and 20 elders verse 18 of chapter 11 and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time of the dead they shall be judged and that thou should give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the saints and them that fear thy name small and great and should destroy them that destroy the earth another place it talks about how that they will run for the rocks and the mountains and the hills to cover them and to hide them verse chapter 6 verse 16 and said to the mountains and the rocks fall on us and hide us that saith on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand back in proverbs it says i i also will laugh at your calamity i will mock when you fear cometh when fear cometh as destruction and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind distressed and anguish cometh upon you how many knows when the trade tribulation period comes when the end of the world comes i really don't think anybody's going to be ignorant anymore nobody's going to be an unbeliever anymore they're all going to know that god's wrath is coming down on them there's not going to be any question because it even says the small the great kings of the earth they all went to hiding who knows just what the meaning of that is maybe going to canada maybe go into these mountains and caves maybe go into these bomb shelters to government build i don't know but they're going to try to go hide they're not going to go hide am i right but they'll know that god is going to god's wrath is coming and whenever god has his port out folks let me tell you something i would never want to be on the rise the wrong side of that because his wrath is poured out without mixture and who shall be able it is going to be cruel the bible says it's going to be cruel and fierce unlike anything you have ever imagined oh listen distress cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but i will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me let me just stop there for a minute for those who reject his commandments don't obey him don't come when the holy spirit says come now tonight every service that god has when the holy spirit says come when you feel that tug give your heart to the lord but abram says there will come a time when the bride will preach to the total lost is that the people will actually come to the altar thinking they're getting saved sinking they're getting filled with the holy ghost did but they're not getting a thing but they come back they can come up they go back as empty as what they come they never did get it in the first place they don't even know what it is because they never had but they will not be able to get they'll seek me early but they shall not find me for they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the lord that reminds me of this world that we're living in our politics they hated the truth they hated to be corrected and they know that they are correct they know they're wrong but they hate that they don't choose that i don't choose to know that i'm wrong they choose they did not choose the fear of the lord amen it would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof amen how many knows as many as i love i reprove jason scorch each one that comes to god over in revelations as many as i love i rebuke and chasten as many as i love that was this generation to the prophet of god he rebuked this generation like none other he reproved this generation by coming and vindicating and proving that what he was saying was the truth he reproved it chastised it and so forth but there would none of it if they did if they did all the baptists all the methodists all the presbyterian would be packed into this little place right now go ahead yeah they would obey the voice of god but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god god speaks through the seventh angel god speaks through his messengers all right therefore shall they sit down to dinner eat therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way yeah you can go do your own thing but you'll pay for it i mean those none of us have a thought coming we do what god says we come his way or we get the prize for it we get to eat the fruit of our own way and they shall be filled with their own devices amen all right let's go back for just a minute and look at can i read quite a few scriptures was that all right another one of my favorite scriptures about blessing and cursing is found and i never forget this deuteronomy 28 it says if you will hearken undiligently unto the voice of thy lord thy god to observe and to do all these commandments well brother father we don't have to obey his commandments we don't we we ain't saved by obeying nothing come on now i argue with me a little bit huh what did jesus say if you love me you ain't got to obey what i say no he said if you love me [Music] obey my commandments same thing here if you will observe to do all of his command which i commandee this day that the lord thy god will set me on high above all the nations of the world how many believe tonight that if you are saved filled with the holy ghost you couldn't come that way outside of obeying the commandments of god and now oh man i was going to make it short tonight but right now i think we go to 12 o'clock now you don't have to feel like they do huh you don't have to be empty on the inside like they are you don't have to get tattoos all over your body from one to the other because you're never happy you don't have to get a facelift you can be happily just as ugly as god made you quit wasting your money getting prettier my wife was telling me today she was telling me a story of a woman that spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and man she just got caught up in looking brighter and birdier and at the end of it she looked horrible and she was a hundred thousand or more in the day [Music] oh my it was terrible i thought yeah that's about right why because people are thirsty but they never get their thirst quenched now think about this oh you're high above the nations of the earth isn't that right think about it you are not like the nations of you're not like the normal person out there the normal person out there has not got the joy of the lord in their heart they don't understand the peace that passes understanding it does something to you oh my and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god i don't care if you live in the city i don't care if you're in the field you're blessed art thou and thou are in the city blessed are that one in the field i don't care if you're an elk but i don't care if you're out there on the farm i don't care where you are you're a blessed person if you know you're right with god tonight you're a happy person blessed shall be the fruit of thy body the fruit of thy ground the fruit of thy cattle the increase of thy kind the flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be the basket and i store blessed are thou and thou comest in the and blessed art thou when thou goest out amen i am blessed i am blessed go with me every day that i live i am blessed [Applause] i am blessed sound like it too amen praise the lord all right when thou come my sin when thy ghost doubt and the lord kills shall cause thy enemies to rise that rise up against thee i believe it one place might be here yet let me see if it is up against ian uh that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall yeah right here it is they shall come out against thee one way and flee before these heavenly every direction trying to get away from you why because the lord fights your battles my friend amen if god be with you who can be against what can be against you amen can i stop right there i'll pick it back up let's go back to haggy eye take another thought of haggy eye this is the same side now of the blessings of those who obey because what we're reading right now i really was going to read the other part first that if you don't obey cursed are you but i didn't so we're going to go back to haggai in chapter 1 and verse the last part of verse 12. all right the high priest with all the remnant of the people and they obeyed the voice of the lord their god in the words of haggie had a prophet as the lord their god had sent him and the people did fear before the lord then speak haggai the lord's messenger in the lord's message unto the people saying and listen after dating all that god just rewards them with one phrase he only rewards them with one phrase he says saying i am with you saith the lord and he says that down in verse 4 of chapter 2 again he says be strong all ye people of the land saith the lord and work for i am with you hallelujah how many is glad that he is with you that's all that matters in this world i've lived six decades almost nine i'm here today the most glorious thing you'll ever have is to know that god is with you just have him with you and now not just with you but in you amen aren't you glad for that because if he's with you that's when you ain't got to worry about your enemies they'll come one way and they'll flee seven why because it ain't you mama lord jesus help us to think that man i am his lock stock and barrel and then when i got to thinking about this he says different times he says i'm with you don't worry about nothing i'm with you when they're here he says i want you to know some i'm with you praise be to god remember brother branham he was in the back of a little trailer one time with a little typewriter and so forth and and and oral roberts billy graham and all them had a multi-million dollars going and all this stuff and he says boy look at them they're showing me their big big buildings multi-million dollar buildings and all this and what have i got a little old typewriter right here he got the feeling bad boy i ain't nothing you know we revere the prophet of god highly don't we as a mighty man of god but while he was here on earth going through the motions and what he was going through he wasn't all that highly esteemed in the world he was living in arizona and none of those churches would even let him come in he had to just go where he could he was despised and thrown out and everything and oh my people disrespected him back then everything else but he had this little place he was just in his little place and he says you know but he said the lord spoke to him what did he say [Music] i am your portion same thing you told abram i'm your porsche that's plenty for me isn't that plenty for you because if you got him you haven't got a care you haven't gotta worry in the world cause god is with you the one that made all this he's with you if he's with you then what can be against you what's going to separate us from the love of god tribulation distress anguish whatever it is sword lions getting part getting what nothing's going to separate us from the love of god amen and when god is with you you have the majority aren't you glad was it elijah and his servant they were coming to get elijah and make him come down to the king and so forth and going to force him with all of these chariots and everything else and uh what was his servant's name kaheizai that right he said elijah he said you know what look at all of them look at all that guys we don't stand a chance what did the prophet say he says lord open his eyes eye i like to close my eyes and i want to imagine when he opened his it was on the mountains everywhere horses and chariots and angels and swords ready to go battle i can't even imagine it that's what he saw there's more of us and there is of them when i'm with you homie's glad he's with you i'm glad he's with you if you obey his commandments he's with you if you disobey his commandments he has to leave you oh that's scary isn't it how many say man you get that temper fit and you could get mad at your neighbor and everything oh the holy ghost just takes his flight go to gossip second you open your mouth god's a gossip he's gone goes up on a hillside somewhere on a branch that don't mean you're lost thank the lord if that was the case that's right everything can go wrong will go wrong but most of all what goes wrong is there's a drought that comes into your life get to all you all leave me nobody loves me peter i'm telling you nobody gives me any credit in the church every thought comes washing down your brain that the devil can pour on you that's when you sit in your house right there with them demons can't even raise your hand no hallelujah don't praise god don't preach it brother yeah i like that as preachers like that you know preach it yeah amen go ahead i'm i don't know i'm just really letting the holy spirit have his way tonight you might think it's a little carnal but i just let him have it i'm like i don't know how i'm going to read all this and say all this lord but you have your way why is it why does the preacher like it because amen is seeking him is seeking the holy spirit on the devil say yeah that's like that a little dog brother branham had he wouldn't attack no skunk but if brother brown said fritz get you boy that's all it took folks now don't want nothing to do with no dog most of us know what that's all about and we've had a couple out there and i'll tell you what them dogs stink for days but they got the job done amen praise the lord all right time's up this is about when i was gonna quit but that's me that's all right well let's go a little further can i i like that too back to deuteronomy but i like that when i saw that a simple phrase i am with you i don't know about you but that might have been millions or thousands of years ago but when you know that that same god that told them that then people that that you're sitting right there tonight and you know without a shadow of a doubt that the holy spirit is in your heart that sounds good i am with you it feels good it sounds good it is good nothing else really matters how many knows everything we do for christ is really the only amen blessed shall thou be when thou come must stand and blessed shall thou be when thou goest out and the lord shall cause an enemy to rise up against thee okay a little further down and the lord command the blessing upon thee shall command the blessing upon thee in a storehouses and in all that thy satisfying hand to do amen how many believe that well should i do this well i'm just going to do the name of the lord watch god bless it come on folks how many in here have put into something and it was blessed let me hear you tonight that's right hi folks i've got many things that could testify about to that's not me that's not my ability that's not your ability that is god god cares about whether you prosper god cares about whether you succeed in what you put your hand to amen my and in all that thou said is a hand unto and he shall bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee the lord shall establish thee and holy people unto himself how many believes that peter said you're a royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people amen how many beliefs that's what you are sitting there you're peculiar you're holy but you're god's god's children as he has thee thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god and walk in his ways i know y'all i know everybody in here i believe with all of my heart there's none of us in here that want to walk in your own way our hearts desire is to find the way of the lord and walk in that way find how god wants you to walk amen and walk in that way it's a blessed road oh it's so blessed you don't have no hardships no sometimes the worst things that could ever imaginably happen to a man happens down that road isn't that right it did for daniel it did for the three hebrew children but god took him through that amen he delivered him out of the mouth fiery furnace god will take you through those things did he deliver the guys that were taking shadrach meshach and abednego up to the furnace did he deliver them guys were they delivered let me hear it no why they didn't nobody they didn't serve god shadrach meshach and abednego they were the ones obeying and listening to god and he was protecting him how many beliefs you got protection amen if you commandments and walk in his ways maybe take that home with us tonight say god help me to obey all your commandments and to walk in your ways oh i'm saved by grace i believe all of that are you filled with the holy ghost but now this is what i want to do because i love him on a walk in his ways i want to obey his commandments so that he doesn't have to turn the water spout off on me he sure will he'll turn the water spout off on you he'll make your life miserable because you will be miserable if you turn from the commandments of god amen and all the people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord and they shall be afraid of thee and the lord shall make thee plenteous in goods in the fruit of thy body and the fruit of that cattle in the fruit of thy ground in the in the land which the lord swear unto thy fathers to give thee and the lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give thee rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thy hand and thou shall lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow amen look at our nation we should be lending to others we shouldn't have to borrow but when you leave the commandments of god you're going to end up borrowing amen the lord shall make thee the head and not the tale thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god which i command thee this day to observe and to do them and if thou shalt go not aside from any of the words which i command thee this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods and serve them what's another god something that you put before the lord when god doesn't have first place in your life anymore you have went after another god how many god has to be first place in our life got the man's first place in our life let me close with matthew simple scripture that i've gone to refer to many times of how the lord cares about our daily life if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is huh how many knows god it's god that's actually causes the grass to grow he takes care of all that if he does that the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow's cast into the oven shall he not much more close you how many is glad to be clothed this evening and i'm not talking about this right here i'm talking about righteousness of jesus christ being on you the blood of jesus christ that made and gave you the access to a robe of righteousness isn't that right but did it say in revelations that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear anointed eyes with eyes have and clothe you that you nakedness do not appear amen he says to clothe us but he also means also means natural amen naturally and spiritually he'll make sure you got something to wear or what listen o ye of little faith therefore taking a thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where with all shall we be clothed i don't want to be here forever but that's what haggy i was saying you go to your house you're so worried about what you got to eat but you got the clothes all about your house and your world am i right that's where the problem lays is we are so concerned about our world instead of what god wants in his world his house and what he wants and as long as you are like that let me say this as long as you're like that to where those other things are more important this is out for the youtube wherever this goes as long as you like that and you make other things more prioritized and you do how that god wants to feed your heart your soul clothe you take care of you keep his commandments it's never gonna turn out right no matter how much you think it does it won't amen for listen or what with all shall we be clothed for after all these things do the americans seek you like that that's about right this is what america seeks for clothing and housing and everything yeah and the world not just americans for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things amen he knows just how to give him to you oh it's one thing and you can be happy when you get something because you work for it this rather but when you know there's something that you couldn't have got by yourself and god just gave it to you that's when you can jump and jump oh and praise be to god to know i am with you he's with you he's going to take care of you even to the end of the world didn't that what he said in matthew and lo i am with you even to the end of the world amen i'm going to remember dale potter tonight i remember is dale potter an old veteran preacher you know and of course he'd always make a funny he says you know i don't fly he went to arizona tucson and he would drive all the way out there every time because he would not get in the airplane he had a scripture for it he said the bible says lo i am with you uh so we commemorate mother dale our beloved brother amen however amen behold i am with you even to the end of the age god bless you let's stand musicians if you'll come with heads bowed tonight which just want to say you know i really would like to know in a greater way that without a shadow of a doubt that he is with me is there any here that just really want to make sure that you know that you know that he is with you god bless you god bless you god bless you lord jesus we come before you father tonight and we all want to make sure that we're standing in that place of blessing in that place that you can come and make your abode in our temple because we do what you set for us to do we obey your commandments lord and that pleases you we fear you like those didn't hate y'all they feared the lord and obeyed and god says all right you did what i asked you to do now i want you to know i am with you you obeyed that holy spirit tonight that spoke to your heart to tell you that you really want a greater confirmation perhaps you want to know that you know that he is with you and you raised your hand and said that's what i want to know jesus saw that he sees it right now he knows your heart purpose in your heart tonight that you will serve him with all that's within you and watch god bless you and bring oil and wine into your heart stimulation of revelation he'll speak to you in such a way until it'll overjoy your heart to know the things that he talks to you about that he shows you that he walks with you amen and that he promised never to leave you oh god this evening we come before you lord and we ask god that you'll touch every heart that you'll touch every soul right now in the name of jesus christ if there's those that do not obey you like they should we ask god you'd help each one tonight that will obey that what you said dude that's what we'll do no offense or buts we won't let the devil talk us out of it lord but we'll just do what you said do because you said it and we want to be pleasing to you lord and that's because we love you we know saint john said if any man says that he loves god and does not obey his commandments he's actually a liar lord jesus we don't want to be liars we want to truly love you with all of our heart draw us closer to you lord and we'll thank you and praise you from jesus name amen and amen god bless you brother david [Music]
