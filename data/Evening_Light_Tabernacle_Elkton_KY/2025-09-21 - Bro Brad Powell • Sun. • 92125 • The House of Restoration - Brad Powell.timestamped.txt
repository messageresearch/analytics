[18:41] Father. And we just thank you, Lord, for
[18:43] answering the prayer for Brother Caleb

[18:55] And Lord, this morning, Father, we want
[18:57] to thank you, Lord, for every soul
[18:58] that's in here, Lord. For each person at
[19:00] the Evening Light Tabernacle, Father, of
[19:03] the fellowship that we have with you and
[19:05] the fellowship that we have one with
[19:06] another. And we pray for all those that
[19:08] are traveling, Lord Jesus, on vacation
[19:10] and different places. We ask for
[19:12] traveling mercies for them. We ask God
[19:14] this morning also for those that are
[19:16] streaming. We pray, God, that you'd give
[19:17] them good health, Lord Jesus, and that
[19:19] they'll be blessed by the service this
[19:21] morning. Also, we ask God that you'll
[19:23] just bless brother Brad, father, to be
[19:25] able to step out of the way and let your
[19:26] Holy Spirit speak to the church the
[19:29] thing that you want to say this morning,
[19:30] Father. Lord, we praise you. We give
[19:32] honor and glory to you now as we commit
[19:35] this service to you in Jesus' name. Do
[19:38] you usually dismissed for Sunday school
[19:39] about now? All right, let's be dismissed
[19:41] for Sunday school. Amen. And brother
[19:43] Troy will come for our Bible reading.
[19:51] If we just go in the Psalms, we're going
[19:53] to go to Psalms um 46.
[20:01] Psalms 46.
[20:10] God is our refuge and strength, a very
[20:13] present help in trouble.
[20:24] Though the waters thereof roar and be
[20:26] troubled, though the mountains shake
[20:28] with the swelling thereof, say
[20:40] &gt;&gt; God is in the midst of her. She shall
[20:43] not be moved. God shall help her in that
[20:46] right early.
[20:53] The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of
[20:56] Jacob is our refuge. Sail.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; He maketh wars to cease unto the end of
[21:07] the earth. He breakth the bow and cutth
[21:10] the spear in thunder. He burneth the
[21:12] chariot in the fire.
[21:21] this one together. The Lord of hosts is
[21:23] with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge.
[21:26] Sailor, God bless. You may be seated,
[21:28] Brother Brian.
[21:44] Morning brothers and sisters.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; After reading the psalm like that, do
[21:50] you have anything to worry about if you
[21:52] put it in God's hand? I was listening to
[21:55] a message yesterday. has
[21:58] uh it went with the as you know if you
[22:01] open the
[22:03] the spoken word thing you know they have
[22:05] a devotional for every day you know they
[22:07] have a page and the message was you must
[22:10] be born again and the one thing brother
[22:12] Brandham was saying in the message you
[22:14] know that statement look and live and I
[22:17] was just thinking this morning everyone
[22:20] he talks he talks about how the children
[22:22] of Israel you know they rebelled against
[22:26] Moses. God sent serpents and he he told
[22:29] Moses to raise the serpent up, the brass
[22:31] serpent, and if they looked on it, they
[22:34] would live. And I was thinking, you
[22:36] know, everyone here this morning,
[22:37] whether it's the smallest child or the
[22:40] oldest men and women, you've you all
[22:42] have that you all been bitten by that
[22:44] serpent, which is death. And you have to
[22:46] look and live. And it's and I was just
[22:49] thinking the the world we live in is
[22:51] doing everything it can to put a cloud a
[22:55] darkness between Christ and the world.
[22:58] Christ and his believers. Everything out
[23:00] there in the world, everything that we
[23:02] interreact with every day of our life is
[23:05] trying to cloud your eyes, cloud your
[23:07] soul, cloud your spirit to hide you,
[23:09] keep you from looking to Christ to
[23:12] believe and live everything that we deal
[23:14] with. And I was just I'll just read what
[23:16] he had to say in this this quote. And um
[23:19] if you would turn with me to John Leip
[23:22] 6th chapter
[23:24] and I'll uh just read
[23:29] if you it's a long chapter. John in the
[23:33] beginning of the chapter is where Jesus
[23:35] feeds the thousands. You know he
[23:38] actually performs a miracle. He feeds
[23:41] thousands of people from very few fishes
[23:43] and and bread. So he's he's done a great
[23:46] miracle in front of the children of
[23:48] Israel. And then uh if you re I think I
[23:52] lost my place
[23:56] about the 24th verse uh and then I'll
[23:58] read this quote here this morning
[24:01] trying to get my the right thought in my
[24:03] mind that maybe God that would have and
[24:06] it's starting about the 24th verse. Uh I
[24:08] won't read a lot this morning and he's
[24:12] already been out. He's already gone and
[24:14] he's coming back again. And this is what
[24:15] I was going to read. When the people
[24:17] therefore seizes Jesus was not there,
[24:20] neither his disciples, they also took
[24:23] shipping and came to Capernium seeking
[24:25] for Jesus. And when they had found him
[24:28] on the other side of the sea, they said
[24:30] unto him, Rabbi, what when comest thou
[24:33] hither? And Jesus answered them and
[24:35] said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[24:38] you seek me not because you saw the
[24:40] miracles, but because you did eat of the
[24:43] loaves and were filled, and labor not
[24:45] for the meat which is perishes, but for
[24:47] that meat which is endureth onto
[24:50] everlasting life, which the Son of Man
[24:52] shall give unto you, for him hath God
[24:55] the Father sealed." And and and
[24:58] then you go, this is what the people go
[25:00] on to say later. And I to me it's really
[25:02] striking that they could actually see
[25:04] God multiply food and yet are still
[25:07] seeking a greater miracle than that. But
[25:10] I'll just read what they when they said
[25:12] unto them, what shall you we do that we
[25:14] might the works of God. And Jesus
[25:17] answered and said unto them, this is the
[25:19] work of God that you believe on whom he
[25:21] hath sent. And we're in the same place
[25:24] this morning. Everyone has to make that
[25:26] choice. You have to believe on on the
[25:28] message as God has given it to you. They
[25:31] said, "Therefore unto him," this is what
[25:34] really struck me as I was reading this
[25:36] this morning. They had already seen a
[25:38] great sign, a great miracle.
[25:41] That wasn't enough for him. Then they he
[25:43] says, "Therefore say unto them, what
[25:45] sign show us thou that we that we might
[25:48] see and believe thee, what does thou
[25:50] work? And our fathers did eat manner in
[25:53] the desert. As is written, he gave them
[25:56] bread from heaven to eat. So
[25:59] they can't believe the very they can't
[26:02] believe what Jesus is telling them. They
[26:04] can't believe the miracles. So what's it
[26:06] going to take to wake them up? You know
[26:07] what is actually going to wake them up?
[26:10] And we all know that even I'll just read
[26:13] what it I said I wouldn't read a lot.
[26:15] But then if it's God's word that it's
[26:17] not what I have to say. Then Jesus said
[26:19] unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[26:22] you, Moses gave you not that bread from
[26:25] heaven, but my father giveth you the
[26:27] true bread from heaven, for the bread of
[26:29] God is which cometh down from heaven,
[26:32] and he giveth life unto the world." And
[26:34] they're not realizing that life is going
[26:36] to be in Jesus himself. Then they said
[26:39] unto him, Lord, every more give us this
[26:41] bread. And then Jesus said unto them, I
[26:44] am the bread of life. He that cometh to
[26:46] me shall never hunger. He that believeth
[26:48] on me shall never thirst. That those
[26:51] promises are for us this morning here,
[26:53] those everyone here has access to those
[26:56] promises. There's nothing keeping you
[26:58] from accessing the promises of God. But
[27:02] I said unto you that you must also have
[27:04] seen me and believe.
[27:07] My my eyes are starting to cloud here.
[27:09] But I said unto you that ye also have
[27:11] seen me and believe not. All that the
[27:14] father giveth me shall come to me and
[27:16] him that cometh to me and I'll in no
[27:18] wise cast out. I'll just finish there.
[27:20] And then if you go into the other
[27:22] gospels, you know, like I was saying in
[27:24] the beginning, brother Bannam was
[27:26] talking about just
[27:28] uh just look and see. Look and believe.
[27:30] And I was uh
[27:32] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[27:32] &gt;&gt; I was just going to read what he had to
[27:34] say this morning in this quote. and they
[27:36] were talking in the prayer room. And and
[27:38] when he preached this message, you must
[27:40] be born again. He was pretty rough on
[27:43] all the people in that assembly that
[27:45] day. But this is this comes right off of
[27:47] the spoken voice of God recording. Some
[27:50] of you might have read it already. This
[27:51] is the Saturday one. But before I get
[27:54] started there, I was
[27:57] before I read this, I I thought was
[27:59] coming to me this morning
[28:02] with everything that's going to go on
[28:03] today out there in the world.
[28:09] The really thing that the reason why the
[28:12] world is the way it is this morning, why
[28:14] the church world is the way it is this
[28:16] morning, everything is the way it is
[28:18] because they don't have real honest true
[28:24] Bible go Bible teaching. They lack true
[28:28] unadulterated
[28:30] teaching in the word of God this
[28:31] morning. That's why the world is the way
[28:34] it is. And the one thing that struck me
[28:39] I don't I don't I'm totally off what I
[28:42] was going to say this morning and I I
[28:44] know I I printed it out this morning. I
[28:47] was thinking
[28:50] if you don't know what the Bible says,
[28:52] if if you don't know what the word of
[28:54] God actually says, you'll be you don't
[28:59] know what people are telling you the
[29:01] truth or not. That's why it's so
[29:02] important that you read your Bible this
[29:05] morning that you have the word of God in
[29:07] your heart and life.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; There was a guy I used to listen to
[29:10] years ago and he would always say this
[29:13] to people. He would say when they would
[29:16] come up to him with crazy ideas or crazy
[29:19] beliefs, he would first thing he would
[29:21] ask him, "Have you read your Bible from
[29:22] Genesis 1:1 to Revelation? Have you read
[29:26] the whole Bible at least once?" And then
[29:29] he would before you would even discuss
[29:31] with them what they were trying to
[29:33] represent, he would and they if they
[29:35] said no, he would say, 'Well, then you
[29:37] need to go home and read your Bible
[29:38] cover to cover and then we'll come back
[29:40] and discuss it. And that's where we're
[29:42] at this morning. If you've read your
[29:43] Bible cover to cover, and you know the
[29:46] word of God, then you won't be deceived
[29:48] in the age that we live. And the one
[29:50] thing that struck me,
[29:53] you all, I mean, if you're listening to
[29:55] messages on YouTube or anything, you you
[29:58] all know what I'm about to say.
[30:00] Something will try to sneak in. And the
[30:02] one thing I was noticing about today's
[30:04] events is going to go on this afternoon
[30:07] is people actually
[30:10] trying to make the Catholic Church seem
[30:13] like it's a good thing. And I was just
[30:15] shaking my head. And I was uh and I was
[30:20] thinking obviously they never read the
[30:22] Fox's book of martyrs or Hops two
[30:24] Babylons. Now Hops two Babylons
[30:28] would not be a book that a lot of people
[30:30] would enjoy reading. It's dry. It's
[30:33] long. You have to cross reference
[30:35] everything it talks about. But if you
[30:37] read Fox's Book of Martyr, it's it can
[30:40] be a little hard to read, too. But it's
[30:42] easier to read. And I I just pulled out
[30:44] something. These these are the
[30:46] principles of faith that John Wickcliffe
[30:50] taught. And I don't know if you all know
[30:52] who John Wickcliffe was. He comes a
[30:55] couple of hundred years before Tinddale.
[30:57] This is 12th 13th century England. And I
[31:00] I don't know. These are some basic
[31:03] tenants of what John Wcliffe believed
[31:06] and what the people in his day believed.
[31:09] And to remember, they didn't actually
[31:12] burn him at the stake, but years later
[31:15] they took his bones and body and then
[31:17] burned him at the stake and threw him
[31:18] out. But this is his articles of faith
[31:21] this morning. And uh this will this is
[31:24] what they were putting people to death
[31:27] over. And I and I hear people talk about
[31:29] how the Catholic Church brought the the
[31:32] Bible through the dark ages. And I just
[31:34] shake my head and I and I my mind comes
[31:37] to remembrance. They weren't burning
[31:39] people at the stake because they
[31:41] believed the word of God. They were
[31:43] burning people at the stake because they
[31:45] had the written word of God in their own
[31:47] language. And this is what I don't know
[31:49] why I'm saying this. This is what John
[31:51] Wickcliffe these are some of the
[31:53] principles of his holy teaching. And all
[31:55] of you believe this in one way or the
[31:58] other.
[31:59] Forgive my pronunciation. The Holy
[32:02] Eucharist after the consecration is not
[32:05] the very body of Christ.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; That's that's a truth. We all take
[32:11] communion, but the church, the Orthodox,
[32:14] and the Romans, what have you believe
[32:16] that they can actually bring down a
[32:18] living God and sacrifice him every
[32:20] Sunday in mass? And and I'm not afraid
[32:23] if they hear me. Obviously, this is on
[32:26] YouTube and some people wouldn't like
[32:27] what I just said. And they go to say the
[32:30] church of Rome is not the the church of
[32:32] Rome is not the head of all churches
[32:34] more than any churches.
[32:37] And and nor that Peter had any more
[32:40] power given of Christ than any other
[32:42] apostle had. And it really strikes me
[32:45] that's why you have to know the word of
[32:47] God this morning. You have to know the
[32:49] scriptures.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Peter said in the the two epistles of
[32:53] Peter, he said what he said about Paul
[32:56] is true. He said that people wrestled
[32:59] with the scriptures that taught by Paul
[33:01] to their own destruction. So he
[33:03] testified to the fact that the Paul was
[33:06] the prophetic voice of the word of God
[33:08] for his day and age. And Paul actually
[33:10] said too, you follow Christ as I follow
[33:14] Christ. He never made himself more than
[33:16] what he actually was. And he goes and
[33:19] another one is the pope of Rome has no
[33:22] more in the keys of the church than has
[33:25] than any other within the order of the
[33:27] priesthood. So the pope is no more
[33:29] important than any other minister of
[33:32] God. Now do I look at the pope as a
[33:35] minister of God? No, I don't look at the
[33:37] pope as a minister of God. The gospel is
[33:40] is a rule sufficient of itself to rule
[33:43] the life of every Christian. The gospel
[33:46] itself, the word of God is in itself
[33:50] able to rule the lives of Christians.
[33:52] You don't need another outside force to
[33:55] tell you how to live your life anymore.
[33:57] And he goes on, all other rules under
[33:59] the whose observations and diverse
[34:02] religious persons be governed. You add
[34:04] no more perfection to the gospel than do
[34:07] the white color on a wall. So he's
[34:09] saying whatever they tell you, if it
[34:11] can't come through the word of God, you
[34:13] could paint all the walls you want with
[34:15] what they say, it doesn't mean anything.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; And and the last thing he says, neither
[34:21] the pope nor any other prelate of the
[34:23] church ought to be have prisons wherein
[34:26] to punish transgressors. So he was
[34:29] basically saying that no church has the
[34:32] power to imprison people for what they
[34:35] believe the gospel says. And uh I'll
[34:37] just read what brother Brandham had to
[34:40] say. And it really struck me. You know,
[34:43] the only reason they gave the our
[34:45] Catholic Bible out to the the the
[34:48] Catholics realized if they didn't put
[34:51] the Bible together and give it to their
[34:53] parishioners, the only Bibles that the
[34:55] world would have is the King James
[34:58] version, the Luther version, or whatever
[35:01] language that the Protestants were
[35:03] putting the Bible in. So they at the end
[35:05] they realized that they didn't give the
[35:07] prayer book and the the the Roman
[35:09] scriptures out to the people that they
[35:12] wouldn't have anything to fight
[35:14] Protestantism with. But I'll just I'll
[35:17] just read what brother Brandham had to
[35:19] say this morning and sit down. And the
[35:22] other thing that struck me
[35:26] is I was just thinking politically wise,
[35:29] I can see our own country being
[35:32] isolated. Eventually, it'll be isolated,
[35:34] but I'll just see, you know, I'll just
[35:36] read what Brother Brandham had to say. I
[35:38] read that I listened to that message,
[35:41] Doors and Doors this morning. I listened
[35:43] to some other messages, but it really
[35:46] this is I'll just read what he had to
[35:48] say here and sit down and I keep on
[35:50] talking. And I apologize for that. Now
[35:52] you people talking about getting the
[35:54] Holy Ghost on how you have to wait so
[35:57] long. Here you are until God receives
[36:00] that sacrifice until it's laid on his
[36:02] judgment there. That's what I was saying
[36:04] soon as I first thing I said when I
[36:06] started look and live. You got to look
[36:09] to that sacrifice. You just don't have
[36:11] to look to it, but it has to transcend
[36:13] into your heart and soul this morning.
[36:15] And he says until this judgment has
[36:17] actually killed your senses. That goes
[36:19] to what I was saying there. Everything
[36:21] that you are, the old man has to die.
[36:24] Everything's got to be dead this
[36:26] morning. You might say, "Well, I'm going
[36:28] to turn a new page." That goes to what I
[36:31] said last week. You know, it's not just
[36:35] okay. You have to be a new creature in
[36:37] Christ. That ain't it. Well, I know I
[36:39] used to smoke. I'm going to quit
[36:41] smoking. No, that that that is that
[36:44] still isn't it? Until God receives the
[36:47] sacrifice
[36:49] on his brass altar. His altar is
[36:52] judgment. What is his judgment? Death.
[36:55] That's the penalty. And that death is
[36:57] not our physical death. Well, that's our
[36:59] spiritual death to ourselves so that
[37:01] Christ can come into our hearts and
[37:03] live. And then it goes on to say, "The
[37:06] soul that sinnth, it remains and it
[37:08] shall die." I don't care what you've
[37:10] done. Jesus said, "Many will come to me
[37:12] on that say, 'Lord, haven't I done this
[37:15] or done that?" Goes back to what I was
[37:17] reading about what Whitcliffe had to say
[37:19] and what Jesus told the people in his
[37:22] day and age. They were all looking at
[37:24] the wrong things. The right thing to
[37:26] look at is Christ himself. That's the
[37:28] only thing that you can count on in this
[37:31] world is you have to look to Christ
[37:33] himself. No church, not that church is a
[37:36] bad thing, but our hope and everything
[37:39] that we are is built on that fundamental
[37:41] that everything I need is in Christ
[37:43] itself this morning. The soul that
[37:45] sinnth it remains of that shall die. I
[37:48] don't care what you've done. Jesus said,
[37:50] "Many will come to me in that day and
[37:52] say, Lord, haven't I done this and done
[37:54] that?" You say, "Depart from me, you
[37:56] workers of iniquity." You see, that's
[37:58] really important that you don't take a
[38:00] false faith or a false idea, but that
[38:03] you take the true word of God, that
[38:05] you're not deceived on that day. And
[38:08] when the sacrifice is received by fire,
[38:10] then it goes up. That smoke goes up. You
[38:13] rise up with your sacrifice into the
[38:16] heavenlies. You're sealed away from the
[38:18] things of the world. Then our soul is on
[38:20] the altar. It goes to what Jesus was
[38:22] saying in that chapter, too.
[38:26] I might be broken up, but as I see I was
[38:30] they're rewriting history this morning
[38:33] and I I'm not rewriting but world wants
[38:37] to re history and forget all the things
[38:39] that happened in the past and it's not
[38:41] true. You it's either the word of God or
[38:44] it's nothing. If you're believing
[38:46] something that can't come through holy
[38:48] through the message of the hour and the
[38:50] word of God, then you're holding on to
[38:52] something that doesn't have life in it
[38:54] this morning. And what we need this
[38:56] morning is just God himself and the word
[38:58] of God. Brother Devin
[39:16] Uh, I'm gonna get started with a word of
[39:18] prayer because I've never done this
[39:19] before. So, I'm really, really, really,
[39:21] really nervous. So, we're just going to
[39:23] do a word of prayer quick. If you want
[39:24] to play softly, Sister Becky. Dear Lord,
[39:27] we just come before you, Lord, just
[39:29] thanking you for this opportunity, Lord,
[39:30] to come to your house, Lord, and to
[39:32] worship you, Lord Jesus. Lord, we just
[39:35] want to invite your spirit here, Lord. I
[39:37] just pray that you would walk the aisles
[39:38] of this of this church, Lord, and the
[39:41] aisles of our hearts, Lord. Lord, I just
[39:42] pray that we could come with with open
[39:44] hearts, Lord, just willing and ready to
[39:46] receive your word, Lord. I just pray for
[39:48] the song service. I just pray that it
[39:50] could be um in your will, Lord. I just
[39:52] pray that we could all get out of the
[39:54] way, Lord, and just to um worship you
[39:57] here, Lord Jesus. We just pray this all
[39:59] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[1:08:11] tender hand and your mercy, Father, to
[1:08:12] come down in a special way, Lord, in
[1:08:14] each each one of our lives this morning,
[1:08:16] Father. And Father, we open up our
[1:08:18] hearts. We open up our minds, Lord, for
[1:08:20] you to speak to us, Lord Jesus, in a few
[1:08:22] minutes, Father. And we just ask, God,
[1:08:23] for a special anointing, Lord, of real
[1:08:26] freedom this morning, Lord Jesus, to
[1:08:28] worship you in spirit and in truth,
[1:08:30] Father. We ask, God, you'll bless this
[1:08:31] offering now, Lord, may may be used for
[1:08:34] your purpose, Lord Jesus, and bring an
[1:08:36] honor and glory to you, Father. We ask
[1:08:38] it in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And then after I'm done here, Brother
[1:08:44] Tommy will have a special. But let's
[1:08:46] sing when the roll is called up yonder.
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:08:53] When the trumpet of the Lord shall
[1:08:56] sound, and time shall be no more. And
[1:09:00] the morning breaks eternal bright and
[1:09:04] fair.
[1:09:06] When the saved earth shall gather over
[1:09:11] on the other shore, then the roll is
[1:09:15] called up yonder. I'll be there.
[1:09:20] When the roll
[1:09:23] is caught up yonder.
[1:09:27] When the roll
[1:09:30] is called up yonder.
[1:09:33] When the roll
[1:09:36] is called up yonder.
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:09:42] When the roll is called up yonder. I'll
[1:09:46] be there
[1:09:49] on that bright and cloudless morning
[1:09:52] when the dead in Christ shall rise and
[1:09:56] the glory of his resurrection
[1:10:00] share.
[1:10:03] and his chosen one shall gather to their
[1:10:07] home beyond the skies. And the roll is
[1:10:11] called up yonder. I'll be there.
[1:10:16] When the roll
[1:10:19] is called of yonder.
[1:10:23] When the roll
[1:10:26] is called of yonder.
[1:10:30] When the roll
[1:10:33] is called of yonder.
[1:10:38] When the roll is called of yonder, I'll
[1:10:42] be there.
[1:10:45] Let us labor for the master. From the
[1:10:49] dawn till setting sun. Let us talk of
[1:10:54] all his wondrous love and care.
[1:10:59] Then when all of life is over and our
[1:11:04] work on earth is done and the roll is
[1:11:08] called up yonder, I'll be there.
[1:11:13] When the roll
[1:11:16] is called up yonder.
[1:11:20] When the roll
[1:11:23] is called of y.
[1:11:27] When the roll
[1:11:30] is called up yonder.
[1:11:35] When the roll is called up yonder, I'll
[1:11:39] be there.
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:12:04] Hello.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Can y'all hear me?
[1:12:09] Oh man. Boy, it's been like uh two years
[1:12:12] since I've been up here.
[1:12:15] Uh I thought, you know, the Lord has a
[1:12:17] pretty good sense of humor. I'll just
[1:12:18] start out with a little testimony how
[1:12:19] this all came about and why I am back up
[1:12:22] here. You know, Devin when he got asked
[1:12:25] to sing specials, I mean sing, you know,
[1:12:27] and I I we was just sitting there
[1:12:28] talking in the truck and I'm like, you
[1:12:30] know, you can sing a couple songs, you
[1:12:32] know, have you some specials, you know,
[1:12:33] and this and that and it was like
[1:12:34] immediately pricricked my heart. And uh
[1:12:38] I I probably wrote this song like two
[1:12:39] years ago. Uh and you know, the reason
[1:12:42] why I haven't never sung it is because
[1:12:44] you know, you can build up complexes. We
[1:12:45] can build up fears, you know, and and
[1:12:47] God started dealing with me on, you
[1:12:49] know, the same thing originally when I
[1:12:51] got up here. Y'all might remember when I
[1:12:52] got up here, you know, the Lord gave me
[1:12:54] that scripture, fear not, neither be
[1:12:56] dismayed, be courageous, you know, and
[1:12:59] I'm reading in my Bible. It just so
[1:13:01] happened I'd been praying about it
[1:13:02] because I told him, I ain't committing
[1:13:03] to this. How's it sound out there? I got
[1:13:05] this little earpiece in here. I don't
[1:13:07] know how y'all sound good. I'm trying to
[1:13:09] get used to this. But anyway, uh uh
[1:13:11] yeah. Uh, I'm like, uh, I'm reading my
[1:13:15] Bible and I I just so happened, you
[1:13:17] know, I hadn't said nothing out loud and
[1:13:18] I'm just praying about it and I just so
[1:13:20] happened to be halfway through the last
[1:13:22] chapter of Deuteronomy and open up in
[1:13:24] Joshua 1, he says it like multiple
[1:13:26] times, be courageous, fear not. I'm
[1:13:28] like, all right, okay. Because I'm like,
[1:13:30] Lord have mercy. Well, here we go. But
[1:13:31] anyway, uh, so here I am. The Lord has a
[1:13:34] sense of humor. You know, he started
[1:13:35] dealing with me, you know, on being
[1:13:37] courageous, you know, for our young
[1:13:38] folks, everybody else that, you know,
[1:13:40] because even when I committed into my
[1:13:42] heart that night when I decided, okay,
[1:13:43] I'm going to go on singing special.
[1:13:45] We're going to send it. Man, I couldn't
[1:13:47] sleep all night. Here I am tossing and
[1:13:48] turning. So, I'm just going to go on and
[1:13:50] tell you, you know, we we can get
[1:13:51] wrapped up in all these fears, but you
[1:13:53] know, we're more than overcomers in
[1:13:55] Christ Jesus. We are to cast down
[1:13:57] reasoning, cast down imaginations, bring
[1:14:00] everything subject to the word of God
[1:14:02] because, you know, who Christ sets free
[1:14:03] is free indeed. And he just started
[1:14:05] ministering to my heart. You know, it's
[1:14:06] easy for me to sit out there and praise
[1:14:08] God in my pew and wave my handkerchief
[1:14:10] of victory and praise, you know, but
[1:14:12] what about sacrificing and tithing a
[1:14:14] little bit of myself and getting out of
[1:14:15] the way that, you know, he inhabits the
[1:14:17] praise of his people that I can get up
[1:14:19] here, you know, you might be a great
[1:14:21] musician and get up here and sing you
[1:14:22] praises from the from the top and
[1:14:24] blessed be the name of the Lord for
[1:14:26] those gifts, but what about, you know,
[1:14:27] the little Schumanite lady that gave all
[1:14:29] that she had? They gave out abundance of
[1:14:31] her heart. What if we come and give God
[1:14:33] 110% and give everything you got for the
[1:14:35] king because he's worthy to be praised?
[1:14:38] And I just love my Lord Jesus, you know,
[1:14:40] and I'm coming up on four years this
[1:14:42] Thanksgiving that I about died and God's
[1:14:44] changed my whole life and filled me,
[1:14:45] healed me, sealed me, filled me with the
[1:14:47] Holy Ghost. And just uh it's just been
[1:14:49] such a such a journey for me, you know,
[1:14:52] and I I called this song Walking with
[1:14:54] Jesus. And I can just tell you, you
[1:14:55] know, our little outreach, you know,
[1:14:57] walking with Jesus outreach, you know,
[1:14:58] here we are a Mark 16 church, a book of
[1:15:01] Acts church. We're walking with Jesus
[1:15:03] just like the apostles did, you know,
[1:15:05] and my inspiration came years ago when I
[1:15:07] wrote this was, you know, walking with
[1:15:09] Jesus down this old winding road that we
[1:15:11] call life, you know, while we're whining
[1:15:13] and dining, you know, and whining and
[1:15:14] dining. And I was talk I was thinking
[1:15:16] about, you know, here we are drinking
[1:15:18] off this everpresent rock, this
[1:15:20] inexhaustible fountain of life, this
[1:15:21] this wine, this stimulation of re
[1:15:24] revelation, you know, we're we're dining
[1:15:26] around the master's table, the the
[1:15:28] broken body of Christ that brings the
[1:15:30] bread of life to us that we're we're
[1:15:32] eating on this revealed word for our
[1:15:34] day.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; And we count it such a privilege and
[1:15:37] honor, Lord Jesus, that we can sit here
[1:15:39] and know who we are because we know who
[1:15:41] he is. We know who he is because he sent
[1:15:44] us a messenger, a revelations 10:7, a
[1:15:46] voice, a trumpet to call us out, call us
[1:15:49] back into Christ Jesus. And it's just
[1:15:51] got this fire shut up in my bones. I
[1:15:53] ain't no singer. I ain't nothing. But,
[1:15:55] you know, I sit up here in my upper room
[1:15:56] and just play on old guitar. Praise God.
[1:15:59] Just like I told y'all from the
[1:16:00] beginning. Got rid of Tik Tok or
[1:16:02] Instagram and all these different
[1:16:04] things. I do have Instagram for business
[1:16:05] now. But anyway, I got rid of all that.
[1:16:08] Uh, and picked up the guitar, you know.
[1:16:10] And I ain't trying to sit here and act
[1:16:11] like I'm something I'm not. What I like
[1:16:13] to do is praise my Lord Jesus. And you
[1:16:15] know, we can give him everything we got.
[1:16:17] And you know, I'm I might went a little
[1:16:19] bit long, but I still this morning I I
[1:16:21] had this devotional. I just wanted to
[1:16:22] read this to y'all because this is this
[1:16:24] is this is good for all of us. And he
[1:16:26] said he came to Jericho and he went out
[1:16:27] of Jericho with his disciples and a
[1:16:30] great number of people, blind Barnameus,
[1:16:32] the son of Timus. And he sat in the
[1:16:34] highway at the side begging. And when
[1:16:37] they had heard him, it was Jesus of
[1:16:38] Nazareth. He began to cry out and say,
[1:16:40] "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
[1:16:43] me." And and he and he charged him that
[1:16:46] he should hold his peace. And he cried
[1:16:48] out the more a great deal. You know,
[1:16:49] that's what we ought to do today.
[1:16:50] Whatever you have need of, if you need
[1:16:52] healing, if you need deliverance,
[1:16:54] whatever it might be, he's here. Cry out
[1:16:56] to Jesus. Blessed be the name of the
[1:16:58] Lord. Glory. And so you c you cry out to
[1:17:02] Jesus. You know, he cried out to more a
[1:17:03] great deal. Thou son of David, have
[1:17:05] mercy on me. And Jesus stood still and
[1:17:07] commanded him. And he called him and
[1:17:10] they and they called the blind man and
[1:17:11] saying unto him, "Be of good comfort.
[1:17:13] Rise for the master callest for thee."
[1:17:16] He he casting down away his garment rose
[1:17:18] up and come to Jesus. And Jesus answered
[1:17:21] and said unto him, "What wil thou that I
[1:17:23] should do unto thee?" And the blind man
[1:17:25] said unto him, Lord, that I might
[1:17:27] receive my sight. And Jesus said unto
[1:17:29] him, "Go thy way. Thy faith have made
[1:17:31] thee whole." And immediately he received
[1:17:33] his sight and followed Jesus in the way.
[1:17:35] He was walking with Jesus right in the
[1:17:37] way. And the quote of the day that went
[1:17:39] with that on the family altar, it said,
[1:17:41] "Action your faith put in action." What
[1:17:44] good is it to do for you to do to read
[1:17:46] of a historical God that he isn't the
[1:17:48] same God today? What what good is it to
[1:17:51] do to read about an old George
[1:17:53] Washington if he's dead and gone? It's
[1:17:55] just a history fact. But Jesus raised
[1:17:57] from the dead and he's still here the
[1:17:59] same today. What good does it do for you
[1:18:01] to have a painting fire to a freezing
[1:18:03] man? Show him a picture of a nice big
[1:18:06] warm fire that of a man freezing. That's
[1:18:08] something that was that's what the
[1:18:10] people are trying to to keep you alive
[1:18:12] today. No wonder the the we got a
[1:18:15] failure in America and of religion. No
[1:18:17] wonder the magazines say spiritual is
[1:18:19] all gone a burst is is because they
[1:18:21] failed to represent the right thing.
[1:18:23] They're not they're not teaching them
[1:18:25] they're teaching them a historical God.
[1:18:27] But what we need today is a God of
[1:18:29] resurrected from the dead and on hand
[1:18:32] right now to do whatever he promised he
[1:18:34] would to do to confirm his word. And we
[1:18:37] need delegates out there in the audience
[1:18:38] right here right now in Evening Light
[1:18:40] Tabernacle. We need delegates that will
[1:18:43] out audience who will we who's willing
[1:18:46] to rest their soul on the word that God
[1:18:49] said and put it into action. Amen.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; That's what we need today. That's what
[1:18:54] we need. men and women who will stand on
[1:18:55] the forefront there and call the devil a
[1:18:58] liar and say Jesus Christ stripped you
[1:19:00] and robbed you and of every right you
[1:19:02] had and I'm in Jesus Christ and the
[1:19:04] world belongs to me. Amen. What good is
[1:19:07] it to have a bird in with have wings as
[1:19:09] long as he's caught up in a cage. He
[1:19:11] can't fly. He don't need no wings. If
[1:19:12] you got him in a cage, that's the way a
[1:19:14] lot of people are today. They're caged
[1:19:16] up and taught the days of miracles of
[1:19:17] past, you know. And what good does it do
[1:19:20] to you to to what good your wings doing
[1:19:23] for you? What good your faith doing for
[1:19:25] you if you can't turn it loose? What
[1:19:27] good your faith going to do if you can't
[1:19:29] put it into action? Certainly. If I
[1:19:31] believe Jesus Christ today, I put him in
[1:19:34] action. Amen. He lives today. He's the
[1:19:37] same Jesus. Certainly he is. If the
[1:19:39] blind Barnameus can trust him, I can
[1:19:41] too. If the woman with the blood issue
[1:19:43] can touch him, I could too. I can. For
[1:19:46] he is willing and open. He's begging and
[1:19:49] accepting whosoever will, let him come
[1:19:51] and drink of the waters freely. And what
[1:19:53] we need today is a revival of that type.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Oh boy.
[1:20:07] A little nervous and shaky.
[1:20:10] Does it sound good to y'all?
[1:20:18] Well,
[1:20:20] we're going to kick off here in a
[1:20:21] second, boys. Y'all just hang on to
[1:20:23] buckle up. Keep your arms and leg rides.
[1:20:25] Keep your arms and legs in the ride at
[1:20:27] all times.
[1:20:29] All right.
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:21:02] Yes, I'm walking
[1:21:04] with Jesus
[1:21:06] down this winding road.
[1:21:09] We're winding
[1:21:11] and ding the time of our lives.
[1:21:16] I want to sing
[1:21:20] a new song of praise.
[1:21:23] And in my song is amazing
[1:21:29] grace.
[1:21:32] It's amazing
[1:21:34] grace.
[1:21:36] How sweet the sound
[1:21:39] that says
[1:21:42] like you like me. I once
[1:21:48] was lost but now I'm found. I was blind
[1:21:56] but now I see.
[1:22:01] Yes, I'm walking with Jesus
[1:22:05] at the time of my life.
[1:22:08] Because
[1:22:10] he's the truth, the way, and the life. I
[1:22:15] love you, oh Lord,
[1:22:18] because you first love me, and you
[1:22:23] pulled on my old heartstrings.
[1:22:29] And now I can say
[1:22:33] that I'm walking with Jesus,
[1:22:36] having the time of my life.
[1:22:40] Recall
[1:22:41] he's the truth, the way, and the life.
[1:22:46] He said he's the same yesterday,
[1:22:50] today, forever, and always.
[1:22:53] Be thou courageous and be thou strong.
[1:22:59] Fear not. Only believe.
[1:23:03] I love you, my son.
[1:23:06] I want you to know.
[1:23:10] You can take my words everywhere you go.
[1:23:16] I'll always be right by
[1:23:19] right by your side. I'll be with you
[1:23:24] even in you to the end of the world.
[1:23:32] Yes, I'm walking with Jesus.
[1:23:37] Having the time of my life, I love him
[1:23:41] more.
[1:23:43] The father we go.
[1:23:46] Lord
[1:23:48] help me as I surrender to you. So you
[1:23:54] can walk with me and even in me too.
[1:24:00] Oh Lord, I love you Lord. I love you
[1:24:04] Lord more than words can describe.
[1:24:09] And you
[1:24:11] know it's from the inside
[1:24:15] because you place that seed Lord
[1:24:18] way down in me
[1:24:22] because
[1:24:24] I'm from eternity.
[1:24:30] And I love to sing of your praises,
[1:24:32] Lord. Amazing
[1:24:35] grace. Oh, how sweet the sound that says
[1:24:42] like you and me.
[1:24:46] I once was lost, but now I'm found. I
[1:24:52] was blind,
[1:24:54] but now I see.
[1:24:58] It's amazing grace that saved me.
[1:25:03] It set me free.
[1:25:06] And I can worship him in spirit and
[1:25:10] truth.
[1:25:12] For who Christ sets free
[1:25:16] is free indeed. And I love to sing of
[1:25:22] your praises.
[1:25:25] I love you Jesus.
[1:25:28] Lord Jesus,
[1:25:31] I love to praise your holy name.
[1:25:37] Oh, magnify
[1:25:40] the king of glory
[1:25:44] and shout out how much you love to
[1:25:47] praise him.
[1:25:50] Praise you, Lord.
[1:25:53] I love you, Lord.
[1:25:56] I love to praise your holy name.
[1:26:01] [Music]
[1:26:03] [Applause]
[1:26:04] [Music]
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; If I could only try,
[1:26:23] but blessed be his name. Oh man,
[1:26:26] sweating bullets up here, boys. It's
[1:26:29] hot.
[1:26:34] I think he worked himself up a little
[1:26:36] bit.
[1:26:38] Amen. He'll get the hang of it. You'll
[1:26:40] get the hang of it. You got to do it
[1:26:41] more often, Brother Tommy. You
[1:26:45] Amen. Give him a hand.
[1:26:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:51] Amen. Praise the Lord. I think when my
[1:26:54] one more thing I'll say before we stand.
[1:26:56] Amen. Hope hopefully nobody's in a hurry
[1:26:58] this morning, right? Because if you are,
[1:26:59] you may be in trouble. So anyway, so
[1:27:03] amen. I think when Micah used to go see
[1:27:06] Grace, didn't they used to say it's nice
[1:27:09] to have Kentucky with us? No, they said
[1:27:12] yeah, they down there. They say always
[1:27:13] say good to have Kentucky with us. So
[1:27:15] we're going to say it's good to have
[1:27:16] Indiana with us this morning. Amen.
[1:27:19] Brother Gersham. Always good to have him
[1:27:20] with us. Amen. God bless you, brother
[1:27:22] Gersham. Amen. God bless you this
[1:27:24] morning. How many is just going to pull
[1:27:25] from the gift of God now? Let's stand if
[1:27:28] you will with me. Let's sing uh here's
[1:27:30] my cup, Lord. I lift it up. Amen. As
[1:27:34] brother Brad comes and brings the word.

[1:27:40] Lord.
[1:27:42] I lift it up,

[1:27:53] the thirsting

[1:28:20] and make me whole. Once again, with all
[1:28:24] your hearts, let's just sing to him. Oh,
[1:28:26] fill my cup,
[1:28:30] Lord.
[1:28:32] I lift it up, Lord.
[1:28:39] Come and quench
[1:28:43] this
[1:28:46] my soul.
[1:28:51] Bread of heaven.
[1:28:56] Feed me till I want
[1:29:00] no more.
[1:29:04] Here's my cup.
[1:29:07] Fill it up and make me whole.
[1:29:15] Aren't you thankful there's somebody
[1:29:16] that can make you whole this morning?
[1:29:18] It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[1:29:20] and thank for all the pre-ervice, man.
[1:29:22] Brother Devin, great job. My I tell you
[1:29:25] what, thank we're just thankful God
[1:29:27] sends us good young talent
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; to one of these days fill some of these
[1:29:32] old shoes. So, we're certain, brother
[1:29:35] Steve, you you know what I mean? We're
[1:29:37] just getting older and and uh all of us.
[1:29:39] So, good musicians. We appreciate you
[1:29:42] and we appreciate the songs that we're
[1:29:43] sang and thankful for that. But we're
[1:29:46] now we're go here to the most important
[1:29:47] part of the service.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; This is the most important part. And so,
[1:29:51] we're going to set aside some time. Now,
[1:29:53] y'all y'all eat into my time,
[1:29:57] okay? So don't don't blame me when we go
[1:30:00] to 1:00 1:15 cuz y'all eat into my time.
[1:30:04] So uh I'm not going to rush. I'm just
[1:30:08] going to go with what the way we feel
[1:30:09] led because I believe the Lord's really
[1:30:11] got something good for us in store for
[1:30:12] us this morning. And I believe he wants
[1:30:14] to speak to our hearts this morning. And
[1:30:16] I believe he wants to just pull us in
[1:30:18] close and and uh talk to us this
[1:30:21] morning. So, my my title, if they've got
[1:30:23] that up, I want to speak on the the
[1:30:26] house of restoration. The house of
[1:30:29] restoration. Now, we could take this as
[1:30:31] a part seven in our series. Uh, and
[1:30:34] it'll go right along with kind of where
[1:30:35] we're at. Uh, but I didn't really intend
[1:30:38] it that way or the Lord didn't it just
[1:30:39] come to me through the last week and a
[1:30:41] half or so to start sharing this. So,
[1:30:44] while you're standing, I want I like to
[1:30:46] read a quote to to start a foundation.
[1:30:48] So, if you'll just uh listen and pay
[1:30:50] attention for just a minute and we'll
[1:30:52] get right into the scriptures. But the
[1:30:53] prophet says to restore, it means to
[1:30:56] bring back
[1:30:58] or to restore. He said a claim that can
[1:31:01] be enforced. He said now to bring
[1:31:04] anything back to its rightful owner
[1:31:06] where it belongs. Therefore, some way it
[1:31:09] went away from its rightful ownership
[1:31:12] and can wander around anywhere. But to
[1:31:15] restore is to bring it back to who
[1:31:19] really owns it or to bring it back to
[1:31:22] its natural estate where it was at the
[1:31:26] first time. Bring it back into its
[1:31:28] natural condition.
[1:31:31] Are you with me? And in order to do
[1:31:33] this, we have to have a right to
[1:31:35] enforce.
[1:31:37] So we have to have a right to enforce.
[1:31:39] Now, if there is a law to enforce this
[1:31:42] rightful condition of restoration to
[1:31:44] restore, he said it's like if somebody
[1:31:46] stole property, brothers, I'm getting a
[1:31:48] little bit of rebound up here. It's kind
[1:31:50] of echoey. If somebody stole some
[1:31:53] property and they're holding the
[1:31:55] property captive, he said, then you can
[1:31:57] take the law and go to that person and
[1:32:00] the law forces and forces this person to
[1:32:04] restore this property back to its
[1:32:06] natural owner and to its first estate.
[1:32:09] He says enforcement and he's excited. He
[1:32:12] says enforcement. He said what a text.
[1:32:14] I'd like to stay on that for two days to
[1:32:16] enforce. He says enforce. We have a
[1:32:20] privilege to enforce upon Satan the
[1:32:23] claims that God has given us.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; For God has a law.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is where it gets good. For God
[1:32:34] has a law and his word is a law. And God
[1:32:38] in his word made certain claims to the
[1:32:41] church.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Who's he speaking to?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Us.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; The bride. The church. God made certain
[1:32:48] claims to the church. Therefore, we have
[1:32:50] a right to force these claims upon Satan
[1:32:54] and say, "Give it back.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Give it back." And he has to do it.
[1:33:02] [Applause]
[1:33:04] You've got a right to force claims upon
[1:33:06] Satan this morning. And he has to do it.
[1:33:10] He says, "Because we can take God's
[1:33:12] agent." Oh, I like this. The Holy Spirit
[1:33:16] and go right down on our knees and say,
[1:33:19] "It's thus saith the Lord."
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Now, did you catch how rich that was?
[1:33:28] That ain't That ain't whole milk. That's
[1:33:30] chocolate milk right there.
[1:33:33] This is good right here. He says you can
[1:33:35] take God's agent, the Holy Spirit, go
[1:33:37] right down on our knees and say, "It's
[1:33:39] thus sayeth the Lord." He's got to give
[1:33:41] it up cuz the Holy Spirit is there to
[1:33:44] make him do it.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; The law of the land is to enforce and
[1:33:51] it's by the land for the land. But the
[1:33:53] law of the spirit of God is to force
[1:33:55] Satan to give it up that which he has
[1:33:58] unrightfully
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; and deceitfully
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; taken from God.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Souls of men from of God, souls of
[1:34:09] women, souls of children, sickness of
[1:34:11] the body, he places upon the people
[1:34:13] where God made them in his image to be
[1:34:17] like him. And the church is given the
[1:34:19] rightful legal rights by the Bible to
[1:34:22] take the Holy Spirit and enforce this
[1:34:25] upon him.
[1:34:28] That's powerful. That's powerful when we
[1:34:31] realize the power that God has given us
[1:34:33] through the agent of the Holy Spirit. Do
[1:34:36] you know what an agent is? An agent is
[1:34:38] one who is sent to carry out that which
[1:34:41] he's been told to do.
[1:34:45] Turn with me if you would into Psalms
[1:34:47] 51.
[1:34:56] Psalms 51 and verse 10. Very familiar
[1:34:59] scripture here.
[1:35:02] Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and
[1:35:05] renew a right spirit within me.
[1:35:10] Cast me not away from thy presence, and
[1:35:12] take not thy holy spirit from me.
[1:35:16] Restore,
[1:35:18] restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:35:20] salvation, and uphold me with thy free
[1:35:24] spirit. Brother Austin, can you pull up
[1:35:27] Malachi real quick? Malachi 4. Very
[1:35:29] familiar scripture. We know it by heart.
[1:35:31] And if he can't get it up, I'm going to
[1:35:32] read it. If he can't get it up before I
[1:35:34] get to it, there. There we go. For
[1:35:36] behold, the day cometh that shall burn
[1:35:38] as an oven, and and all the proud, yay,
[1:35:41] and all that do wickedly shall be
[1:35:43] stubble. And the day cometh that shall
[1:35:45] burn them up, sayaeth the Lord of hosts,
[1:35:47] that it shall leave them neither root
[1:35:49] nor branch.
[1:35:52] Oh, we had the wrong one. Let's go to
[1:35:55] five. I knew it wasn't sounding right.
[1:35:57] Four, five, and six. There we go.
[1:35:59] Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:36:01] before the coming of the great and
[1:36:03] dreadful day of the Lord.
[1:36:06] Next,
[1:36:08] and he shall what? Turn the hearts of
[1:36:11] the fathers to the children, and the
[1:36:13] hearts of the children to their fathers,
[1:36:15] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[1:36:17] curse. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:36:19] Father, we're just thankful, Lord, to be
[1:36:21] in your house once again just to just to
[1:36:23] feel your presence, feel your anointing,
[1:36:25] and the people that's come hungering for
[1:36:27] more of you this morning and just wants
[1:36:29] a closer walk, whatever the need in
[1:36:31] their life would be. And Lord, we just
[1:36:33] ask that you would just move through the
[1:36:35] congregation this morning that you would
[1:36:37] just come and woo amongst your people,
[1:36:38] Lord, and and just see what what the
[1:36:41] needs of the people are, whether there's
[1:36:42] sickness or whether there's uh a
[1:36:45] hindrance or there's a backslider or
[1:36:47] whatever it may be. If there's somebody
[1:36:48] that needs more of you, whatever the
[1:36:50] situation may be, Lord, we just ask that
[1:36:52] you would come and speak to us, that you
[1:36:54] would move, that you would just restore
[1:36:56] all that's been lost and prepare us in
[1:36:59] this hour we're living in. We love you,
[1:37:00] Lord, with all of our hearts in Jesus'
[1:37:02] name. You can have your seats,
[1:37:06] the house of restoration. So brothers
[1:37:09] and sisters, I looking at this and as
[1:37:11] the Lord been kind of dealing with me on
[1:37:12] this topic and I thought we live in a
[1:37:15] world that is full of broken things.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; We live in a world that is full of
[1:37:20] broken relationships. It's it's full of
[1:37:23] broken dreams and broken hearts and
[1:37:25] broken spirits and broken homes.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Think about it. That's the condition of
[1:37:31] this world we're living in. But I can
[1:37:33] tell you one of the most beautiful and
[1:37:34] the most powerful truths in all of God's
[1:37:37] word is that our God is in the business
[1:37:40] of restoration.
[1:37:42] He is a he is a restorer of his people
[1:37:45] and he loves to restore that which has
[1:37:47] been lost, that which has been broken,
[1:37:49] that which is in shambles. Now the house
[1:37:52] of God we know is a house of correction.
[1:37:55] The house of God is a house of healing.
[1:37:57] The house of God is a house of worship
[1:38:00] and a house of praise. But thank God
[1:38:02] this morning that we can come to a
[1:38:04] house, the house of God that is a house
[1:38:06] of restoration in an hour when we need
[1:38:10] more of God.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; The scriptures are just full of the
[1:38:14] stories of restorative power and and his
[1:38:17] his relentless love. And we see it in
[1:38:20] the lives of individuals as as God
[1:38:23] begins to deal with individuals
[1:38:24] throughout the scriptures. And he he
[1:38:27] deals with individuals from the
[1:38:28] beginning all the way to the end. And
[1:38:30] even in now where we live, he's dealing
[1:38:32] with individuals that are broken, that
[1:38:35] are hurt, that have been damaged. How
[1:38:38] many's ever thought, I'm nothing but
[1:38:39] damaged goods?
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Sure we have. But God deals with those
[1:38:44] people and he puts his love. He tenderly
[1:38:47] puts those people back together.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; He doesn't leave his people in shambles.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; God's not going to leave you
[1:38:56] brokenhearted. He's not going to leave
[1:38:58] you distressed. He's not going to leave
[1:38:59] you out wandering around in the
[1:39:01] wilderness if you're one of his. So when
[1:39:04] God begins to deal with you, when God
[1:39:06] begins to pull on your heart and tug at
[1:39:09] your heartstrings,
[1:39:10] it's because he's tenderly trying to
[1:39:12] pull you back into the fold and say,
[1:39:14] "Come, my child. Come, my child. Get
[1:39:17] close to me. Get warm by me."
[1:39:22] And God begins to do this and he looks
[1:39:25] and we can see that he comes in and he
[1:39:26] takes entire nations.
[1:39:29] Think about it in the Bible. He's took
[1:39:32] an entire nation, the children of
[1:39:34] Israel, and put them into a restorative
[1:39:37] state and said, "I have given you this
[1:39:39] promised land. Now all you have to do is
[1:39:42] stand up on the word and go get what's
[1:39:45] rightfully yours." Set your claim upon
[1:39:48] the devil.
[1:39:51] You think, "Well, that sounds easy."
[1:39:54] There was two that believed.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you you you're saying
[1:40:00] it's there." It is there, but you got to
[1:40:02] believe it.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; You got to put it in action. You got to
[1:40:05] put it in word. You got to put it in
[1:40:07] your prayers and you go before the word
[1:40:10] of God with the word and see if things
[1:40:13] don't come to pass.
[1:40:17] every one of those accounts, individuals
[1:40:20] and and the nations and and the people
[1:40:22] Elijah and David and and we could go on
[1:40:25] and Samson and Shamgar and all these all
[1:40:28] these heroes we hear about. God had to
[1:40:31] come down and and use those guys as as
[1:40:34] an account of a shining beacon of hope
[1:40:36] to the world as we know it. Without
[1:40:39] these stories, where would we be?
[1:40:42] Without God moving in their lives and
[1:40:44] somebody pinning it on paper, where
[1:40:46] would we be? But he cares enough to
[1:40:50] share what he's looking to do in this
[1:40:52] hour.
[1:40:56] So this morning, let's just look over
[1:40:57] God's shoulder.
[1:40:59] Let's just look over God's shoulder this
[1:41:02] morning. And and we'll see him if we'll
[1:41:04] let him. We'll watch him mend broken
[1:41:06] relationships.
[1:41:08] We can watch him mend broken homes. We
[1:41:12] can watch him mend lives that are in
[1:41:14] ruins
[1:41:16] if we'll just watch and let him move and
[1:41:19] let him breathe a life and let him
[1:41:22] breathe a purpose of what he wants for
[1:41:26] us to be.
[1:41:28] People who were absolutely hopeless,
[1:41:32] God pulls them in.
[1:41:36] And I love when the prophet brings this
[1:41:38] into such simplicity.
[1:41:41] You know, he he tells a story and and
[1:41:43] you know, sometimes I hate to call them
[1:41:44] stories because in our minds a story is
[1:41:46] a sometimes a we could say a story is
[1:41:49] sometimes fictional. Well, this is a
[1:41:50] non-fiction story. That's right. I have
[1:41:52] to always get that right. Not fake. This
[1:41:55] is real.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; When he tells these stories, they really
[1:41:59] happened.
[1:42:01] He's not making it up to to candy coat
[1:42:03] it or to make you think it's something
[1:42:05] going to happen that that can't happen.
[1:42:07] But he tells these stories to encourage
[1:42:09] our faith. To help us to believe, to
[1:42:12] help us to realize that God moves in
[1:42:14] everyday situations. It's not just in
[1:42:17] the life of David. It's not just in the
[1:42:20] life of Samson.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; It's not just in the children of Israel,
[1:42:23] but it's in Tommy Richmond. It's in John
[1:42:25] Ler. It's in Aaron Foster. It's in these
[1:42:28] kind of people that God moves today.
[1:42:34] He says a brother comes to Louisville
[1:42:38] and he says he comes up here from comes
[1:42:40] up here from Georgia
[1:42:42] and he left his car sitting out there
[1:42:46] and he said he left his car out there
[1:42:48] and somebody stole it.
[1:42:50] And he said he had everything he had in
[1:42:52] that car. All of his clothes, his wife's
[1:42:55] clothes, his children's clothes. He said
[1:42:58] everything that they had brought to
[1:42:59] those meetings. He said this poor
[1:43:00] brother, he said he drives 700 miles
[1:43:02] where and 700 miles home to come to the
[1:43:05] meetings and somebody's done stole his
[1:43:08] car.
[1:43:12] He said what? He didn't know what to do.
[1:43:15] How many of you would would think, man,
[1:43:18] I'm 700 miles from home. My luggage is
[1:43:21] gone. All of my toiletries is gone.
[1:43:23] Everything, all my clothes, my kids, my
[1:43:25] kids clothes, my wife. We What are we
[1:43:26] going to do? How are we going to get
[1:43:27] home? We're in the 60s, 50s, and 60s
[1:43:30] here.
[1:43:33] He said he turned it into the police,
[1:43:36] but they had a big racket going on in
[1:43:38] Louisville.
[1:43:41] He said, "Yeah." He said, "They had a
[1:43:42] big racket going on up there in
[1:43:43] Louisville." They said, "You could steal
[1:43:44] a car. Police couldn't figure it out.
[1:43:46] They could steal a car and they could
[1:43:48] make a title for it in a few minutes.
[1:43:49] Put whatever number you wanted on that
[1:43:51] car and sell it,"
[1:43:55] he said. So, he didn't know what to do.
[1:43:57] He turned it into the police. He said,
[1:43:59] "So, we got down on our knees."
[1:44:08] He said, "Well, where are you going with
[1:44:11] this?"
[1:44:13] He we got down on our knees. He said,
[1:44:16] "So then we had a scripture here where
[1:44:18] Jesus said,
[1:44:22] Paul restores the word. The brother
[1:44:24] Brandham restores the word that Paul
[1:44:26] preached and it builds our faith." I've
[1:44:29] been saying that for the last two
[1:44:30] months. The word builds our faith.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; The scripture builds our faith. You want
[1:44:36] a closer relationship with God? Go to
[1:44:38] him with the word. Amen.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Wherever two or more are
[1:44:45] gathered in my name, if they will agree,
[1:44:47] I'll be in their midst. And if they will
[1:44:49] agree on touching any one certain thing
[1:44:52] and ask it,
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; and don't doubt it, they shall have what
[1:44:57] they asked, it will be given to them."
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; It didn't just say, "If you're sick, if
[1:45:07] you're in dire need,
[1:45:10] He said, "If they will agree on any one
[1:45:11] thing and touch it and believe it and
[1:45:15] don't doubt it, they can have it."
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; How many has a need this morning?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Hands all over the building. We're needy
[1:45:22] people.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; This is what he says. Now, there's the
[1:45:28] law. Oh, here we go. Back to law. I like
[1:45:31] law. Law. I love grace. We need grace.
[1:45:33] We need mercy. Grace. We need all the
[1:45:36] grace and mercy we can get. I do.
[1:45:39] But the law is the law.
[1:45:43] When the law speaks, something has to
[1:45:46] answer.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; And he said, now there's a law. Now, the
[1:45:50] one that's here to enforce that law is
[1:45:53] the Holy Spirit.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:46:00] Let me ask you again, and everybody
[1:46:02] raise their hand. How many believes
[1:46:03] that? Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Because listen what he says. How about
[1:46:09] people who don't believe in the Holy
[1:46:11] Spirit that would reject him?
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He says, "You're rejecting your
[1:46:18] own peace and mercy."
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; God sent an agent called the Holy
[1:46:30] Spirit.
[1:46:32] It's on us as believers to believe that
[1:46:35] agent, the Holy Spirit, is working under
[1:46:37] the leadership of God Almighty.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; And if we can't believe that, all we're
[1:46:42] doing is saying, "We don't need his
[1:46:44] grace. We don't need his peace. We don't
[1:46:46] need his love. We don't need his mercy."
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Do you see why we need the Holy Spirit
[1:46:54] in our lives? Do you see why the young
[1:46:56] people in our churches need the Holy
[1:46:59] Spirit in their lives?
[1:47:07] That's why we welcome the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; That's why we sing those songs. Welcome,
[1:47:13] Holy Spirit.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Be here in our presence.
[1:47:20] Fill us with your power.
[1:47:25] Live inside of me.
[1:47:29] We welcome that Holy Spirit. He said,
[1:47:31] "We went down on our knees, about five
[1:47:33] of us men, and we pleaded the case
[1:47:36] before God."
[1:47:40] [Music]
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; That's the problem. Some of us are not
[1:47:43] willing to go down on our knees and
[1:47:45] plead before God what our needs are.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; And I took the word. Now watch what he
[1:47:57] says. We pleaded the case before God and
[1:48:00] I took the word or the promise.
[1:48:04] H and I sent it forth.
[1:48:10] He took the word. What was the word?
[1:48:12] What do you think the word was? He
[1:48:14] didn't tell us what scripture he used,
[1:48:16] but I can't help but to think the
[1:48:18] scripture that he used would have been
[1:48:19] the one he referenced at the beginning.
[1:48:21] wherever two or more are gathered in his
[1:48:22] name and they agree.
[1:48:24] I have to believe that's probably what
[1:48:26] what he was going to. But he said, "I
[1:48:28] took the word I took the word and the or
[1:48:31] the promise and sent it forth and the
[1:48:34] great Holy Spirit took the word."
[1:48:38] You see why I say the word answers the
[1:48:41] word?
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; You want to hear from God, go take
[1:48:44] scripture to him. He wants to hear that.
[1:48:47] I believe that by your stripes I'm
[1:48:50] healed. He wants to hear that I know
[1:48:53] that I'm a child of God because you
[1:48:55] saved me on Calvary.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; He wants to hear that love conversation
[1:49:00] between us.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; I took the spirit. I took the word. The
[1:49:06] promise sent it forth. The great spirit.
[1:49:08] He took the word. You know what he said
[1:49:11] the great spirit did with the word? He
[1:49:13] said he took that word and he served a
[1:49:15] summons.
[1:49:17] Some of us need to send a summons out to
[1:49:19] the devil.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; He said he sent out a summons and he
[1:49:23] looked at it. He sent out a summons and
[1:49:25] the vision broke.
[1:49:27] What was he doing? Word talking to word.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Sending out a summons to tell him what
[1:49:33] was going on. And then the vision broke
[1:49:35] open. He said, "And that vision broke
[1:49:37] open. I seen a man in a yellow shirt
[1:49:40] driving that truck towards Bowling
[1:49:42] Green, Kentucky.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; He said, I saw him come back there and
[1:49:54] he said, I saw the spirit come upon him
[1:50:00] and I saw the spirit condemn him and he
[1:50:04] turned that truck around. Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; When you go on your knees
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; before God and you begin to take the
[1:50:14] word and say, "God, I know you can
[1:50:15] deliver my needs. I know you can meet my
[1:50:17] need. I know I need healing. And I know
[1:50:20] you're a healer. I know I need my kids.
[1:50:22] I know you're a deliverer." And you
[1:50:24] begin to put out that summons.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Something has to break loose.
[1:50:34] He said he turned that truck around and
[1:50:37] he said, "I saw it and I saw him park it
[1:50:39] and I raised up and I said, "Brethren,
[1:50:42] this is thus sayaeth the Lord. You'll
[1:50:44] find that truck parked across the
[1:50:46] river."
[1:50:49] Now, how would you like to been the one
[1:50:50] going on that goose chase?
[1:50:55] Can you imagine? Hey, get your old car.
[1:50:58] get you get you jalapy. Let's go find my
[1:51:00] truck. It's over there on the other side
[1:51:01] of the river.
[1:51:04] And they pull up there. He says they go
[1:51:06] down. They started out and they went
[1:51:07] down that road and there set that car.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "There set that car half empty
[1:51:16] of gasoline."
[1:51:18] It had a full tank, but now it set with
[1:51:21] a half empty tank, enough to get him to
[1:51:24] halfway to Bowling Green and back to
[1:51:26] Louisville.
[1:51:30] God is mindful of each and every
[1:51:33] situation we're in. So when we're going
[1:51:35] through the hardships and we're going
[1:51:36] through the struggles and the trials,
[1:51:38] it's up to us to believe that God can
[1:51:40] restore no matter what that situation
[1:51:43] is. He says here it was. What was it?
[1:51:46] What was it? He said it was enforcing.
[1:51:49] So we said give it back.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; He said that's what we're talking about.
[1:51:55] Restore it. bring it back to its
[1:51:57] rightful owner because Satan has robbed
[1:52:00] you of your privileges.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; He's here to do what? Steal, kill,
[1:52:11] destroy.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; We can never forget that. We can never
[1:52:14] say that enough because that identifies
[1:52:16] who our who our enemy is. And when we're
[1:52:19] fighting in this battle, we have to be
[1:52:21] able to not note and notify Satan. I'm
[1:52:24] not open for your games.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God. I have the right to
[1:52:32] enforce. I am a privileged person.
[1:52:34] Somebody say, "I'm privileged."
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; You are a privileged son and daughter of
[1:52:40] God. And we have a right this morning by
[1:52:42] the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim.
[1:52:45] Bring it back.
[1:52:47] He says, "So if you're afflicted, oh
[1:52:50] brothers and sisters, if you are
[1:52:52] afflicted, bring it back.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Bring back my health. Bring back my my
[1:52:58] my my body." If you have a right before
[1:53:01] God that you can say, "By his stripes,
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; I am healed.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Bring it back, Satan. Bring it back."
[1:53:14] If you're sitting here depressed,
[1:53:18] tell Satan, "Satan, give it back. Give
[1:53:20] me back my joy."
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; If you're sitting here unhappy, Satan,
[1:53:24] give me back my happiness.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; I'm sending a summon to you.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Show up in court because I've got the
[1:53:34] best lawyer on the face of the earth.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Bring back what you've stole. Give me
[1:53:41] back my happiness. Restore the joy of my
[1:53:43] salvation.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; You know, it's sometimes people don't
[1:53:47] understand. They don't realize when when
[1:53:48] we were up here preaching.
[1:53:51] Not trying to scare you, but we can see
[1:53:53] through you sometimes.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Right, brother Ber?
[1:53:58] We can see if you're depressed.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; We see anxiety.
[1:54:05] We rub shoulders with it.
[1:54:08] We have experienced it
[1:54:11] because we have to fight it.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; We see if you're backsliding.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Some I think I'm going to preach this
[1:54:22] way. Brother Ber,
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; we see if your homes are in disarray.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:39] I I want y'all to come back to church.
[1:54:40] Now, I'm not.
[1:54:43] But we begin to see these things.
[1:54:46] And the prophet tells us when we tell
[1:54:50] Satan to give it back, we're enforcing.
[1:54:53] He said it's it's to restore back to its
[1:54:56] natural condition. Now, I want you to
[1:54:57] listen to what he says. A man that is
[1:54:59] sick, a baby is sick, a woman is sick,
[1:55:02] they're out of their natural condition.
[1:55:06] God didn't make us to be sick.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; God's original plan was not for us to be
[1:55:11] sick, to have anxiety, to have fear, to
[1:55:14] have doubt.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; He didn't intend for any of that to
[1:55:18] happen.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "But so we have a right to
[1:55:23] enforce our claim. It's our claim
[1:55:25] because God gave it to us. By his
[1:55:27] stripes, we're healed. He was wounded
[1:55:29] for our transgressions. With his
[1:55:32] stripes, we're healed." But he said now
[1:55:33] we have to enforce that law. The
[1:55:36] lawgiver, the Holy Spirit himself is
[1:55:39] here, the agent of God to see that it is
[1:55:44] done.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; There is no reason for us brothers and
[1:55:48] sisters to go before the Lord in prayer
[1:55:51] and get a get sign a petition and
[1:55:54] summons it to the devil and then be
[1:55:55] afraid to deliver the paperwork.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; How many's got the Holy Ghost?
[1:56:03] What's he there for? The Holy Ghost is
[1:56:06] there as an agent to see that it's done.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; That it's a finished work. You say,
[1:56:14] "Well, you're just trying to pump us
[1:56:15] up." I'm not trying to pump you up. I'm
[1:56:17] telling you what the word says. I'm
[1:56:19] telling you what the prophet says. I'm
[1:56:20] telling you what the message of the hour
[1:56:22] restores us, too.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; This is a restoration message.
[1:56:28] He says now the only way that he can
[1:56:30] work. You want to know how to make this
[1:56:32] work? You want to know how to have your
[1:56:35] healing? You want to know how to have
[1:56:36] your deliverance? You want to know how
[1:56:37] to have your salvation? The only way to
[1:56:40] make this work is when you let him work.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; It's not you. It's not me. It's not me
[1:56:50] manufacturing. It's not me putting on.
[1:56:52] It's not me doing this or that. But it
[1:56:54] is when we allow God to work. And he
[1:56:56] says, "You got to believe it.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; You got to believe it with all your
[1:57:01] heart. People come up here and pray."
[1:57:03] Where's sister Lisa? Right here. She
[1:57:06] come up here. We prayed. We knew the
[1:57:07] city. Brother Valer, I think it was me,
[1:57:09] you, brother. Me, you, and who else was
[1:57:10] praying for her that I Who was it, sis?
[1:57:13] Andrew Spencer. That's exactly right.
[1:57:17] Now, in my mind, did I think,
[1:57:20] well, it could happen. No,
[1:57:23] I didn't think that. I didn't believe
[1:57:26] that at all. What I believed was if God
[1:57:29] can give anybody in here a child, he can
[1:57:31] give them a child.
[1:57:34] We have to believe and stand on the word
[1:57:36] and see God move.
[1:57:41] Evangelist message is from Malachi.
[1:57:47] I want to go back to the way it was.
[1:57:50] You know, the whole purpose of living
[1:57:52] life is to go back to the original,
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; to go back to the way it was in the
[1:57:57] Garden of Eden.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; And we think it's about building homes
[1:58:02] and making money and getting cars and
[1:58:04] getting riches and our kids having the
[1:58:06] best of everything and doing all that
[1:58:08] they want to do. That's what we think in
[1:58:10] our minds it's for. No, it's about
[1:58:11] getting back to the original Garden of
[1:58:15] Eden,
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; the way God intended it to be.
[1:58:23] I will send you Elijah the prophet and
[1:58:25] he will restore the faith of the
[1:58:26] children back to the fathers. He said,
[1:58:30] "What is it?" Now, I want you to listen
[1:58:32] to how he puts this. What is it,
[1:58:36] brothers and sisters? You see, we got to
[1:58:38] have a restoration
[1:58:40] because down through the ages,
[1:58:43] or we should probably say up through the
[1:58:45] ages,
[1:58:46] truth has been lost.
[1:58:52] They deviated from Paul to Ireanius just
[1:58:55] a little bit
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; and there was some truth lost from Ireus
[1:59:00] to Martin and Martin to Columbbo. They
[1:59:02] began to deviate and got farther and
[1:59:04] farther and farther away from the word
[1:59:06] till that the world got darker and
[1:59:08] darker and darker until then all of a
[1:59:11] sudden we had a little more truth in in
[1:59:13] Luther and Wesley's age.
[1:59:17] But then all of a sudden,
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; darkness.
[1:59:23] Darkness came. And I think brother
[1:59:24] Brandham said he he just shaded in just
[1:59:26] a little bit of a little sliver of
[1:59:29] light. And that was you and me.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to be the light in this
[1:59:36] dying world.
[1:59:38] That was you and me. He said, "But the
[1:59:41] message goes forth, a messenger and a
[1:59:43] messenger of the last day. It's not to
[1:59:45] bring them to a creed. See, they wanted
[1:59:47] creeds. We want to follow this this
[1:59:50] system. We want to follow that system.
[1:59:52] We want this this this organization. He
[1:59:55] said it wasn't to get them to follow a
[1:59:56] creed, but to jerk them out of those
[1:59:59] creeds.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; You think that's speaking with authority
[2:00:03] to jerk them out of those creeds.
[2:00:07] Why? Because he was trying to get them
[2:00:09] back to the original faith. He was
[2:00:12] trying to get them back to a message and
[2:00:15] to a to a a group of people like a
[2:00:17] Matthew, a Mark, Luke, and John, a Paul
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; that would live on the original word as
[2:00:24] it was displayed on the day of
[2:00:26] Pentecost.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; We're in these last days.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; What is restoration?
[2:00:36] Restoration
[2:00:38] is the process of of repairing or
[2:00:43] preserving an antique or a car or a
[2:00:46] furniture, something like that.
[2:00:48] Now, I want you to listen to how this
[2:00:50] types
[2:00:51] when you go to restoring something. How
[2:00:53] many's ever tried to restore something?
[2:00:56] Yeah, most of us men are knuckleheaded
[2:00:57] enough to think we're going to restore
[2:00:59] something. I didn't tell you women, but
[2:01:01] us men are knuckleheaded enough we're
[2:01:03] going to restore something.
[2:01:08] But when you res restore something and
[2:01:11] you repair it, you're preserving it.
[2:01:13] You're trying to maintain the This is
[2:01:15] the definition on the on the on the
[2:01:17] internet. You're trying to maintain the
[2:01:21] historical integrity.
[2:01:26] Tommy, if you was building a 1957 Chevy,
[2:01:30] would you put a Ford motor in it? Uh-uh.
[2:01:34] No way. Why? Because he wants that car
[2:01:38] to be just exactly the way it was when
[2:01:40] it rolled off the showroom floor.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; So, it's it's it's it's taken and it's
[2:01:46] it begins to keep the integrity of that
[2:01:49] item that you're restoring.
[2:01:51] You take that car in or that item and
[2:01:53] you begin to clean it.
[2:01:56] You begin to repair the damage. You
[2:01:59] begin to recreate the original finishes.
[2:02:03] Oh, if it was if it was candy apple red,
[2:02:05] what color are you going to paint it?
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Candy apple red.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Candy apple red.
[2:02:12] They go as far as they want the VIN
[2:02:14] numbers to match.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; The door needs to match under the hood
[2:02:18] and this number. And they get so
[2:02:20] specific and they begin to restore. They
[2:02:22] clean it. They repair the damage.
[2:02:24] They're recreating it. Brothers and
[2:02:25] sisters, some of us need a cleaning.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Some of us need a cleaning. Some of us
[2:02:30] need damage control.
[2:02:33] Some of us are in a damaged state
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; sitting here this morning.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; They use
[2:02:46] original finishes using period accurate
[2:02:50] materials and techniques.
[2:02:54] They want it to be just like it was on
[2:02:56] day one.
[2:02:59] We went up to Adriana's here a while
[2:03:01] back and she's, you know, well, if you
[2:03:03] don't know, she's a thrifter. If you
[2:03:04] need anything, she's got it. If she
[2:03:06] don't have it, she'll get it.
[2:03:10] She said, "Let me show you my thrifting
[2:03:11] finds." Cuz she she knows I like to I go
[2:03:14] to the Goodwill and we we trade Goodwill
[2:03:17] finds.
[2:03:19] And she showed me this chair she got at
[2:03:21] a yard sale.
[2:03:23] It's okay if I tell this. I think she
[2:03:26] gave $15, right?
[2:03:29] And I've been doing them around auctions
[2:03:31] and stuff long enough. I can tell piece
[2:03:32] when it's a piece. And I looked at that.
[2:03:36] I flipped it up. I got to looking for a
[2:03:38] trademark on it. Sure enough, I found
[2:03:40] it. I typed it in. I said, "Don't you
[2:03:43] dare touch the leather on this chair.
[2:03:47] Don't touch the leather. You clean it.
[2:03:50] Be careful. Don't damage the leather.
[2:03:54] It's original leather.
[2:03:57] I said, ' Do you know what you have?
[2:03:59] Well, I heard it's a pretty pretty nice
[2:04:01] chair.
[2:04:05] Fully restored. What was the price?
[2:04:09] $6500.
[2:04:14] But she could not go in and scrape and
[2:04:17] scratch and peel the paint and begin to
[2:04:20] to scrape the leather or pull the
[2:04:22] leather off and put some other fabric on
[2:04:24] it. That's not going to work. You had to
[2:04:27] go in there and do it exactly the way
[2:04:28] that the original maker made it.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; And the goal is not to only fix the
[2:04:37] broken parts,
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; but to bring it back to its original
[2:04:43] condition. Some of us are sitting here
[2:04:45] and say, "God, I need you to fix my
[2:04:48] broken parts,
[2:04:50] but bring me back to the original.
[2:04:53] Restore unto me the joy of my salvation.
[2:04:57] Some people I know have have been
[2:04:58] sitting in churches and I've seen them
[2:05:01] years ago. They were so full of life and
[2:05:03] so full of joy and so full of zeal. But
[2:05:07] life has taken a toll.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; And sometimes, brother, people have lost
[2:05:13] their zeal. They've lost their joy.
[2:05:15] They've lost their fire. They can't
[2:05:16] smile. They can't praise. They can't
[2:05:18] sing.
[2:05:21] God needs to come in and do a
[2:05:23] restoration on the heart, on the inside
[2:05:26] to remind you of what he done for you in
[2:05:28] the beginning.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Remember what it was like when you was
[2:05:32] wretched.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Come, my child.
[2:05:44] We got to bring that antique back to its
[2:05:45] original aesthetic and functionality.
[2:05:50] You wasn't made to sit on a pew and just
[2:05:53] listen like a bump on a pickle.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; That's not what you was aesthetically.
[2:06:00] That's not what your functionality was.
[2:06:03] God is wanting worshippers.
[2:06:08] God is looking for people that will
[2:06:09] praise him and worship him
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; and will bow down and thank him for the
[2:06:13] goodness of it that he's done for them.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[2:06:22] It's to bring it back to its aesthetic,
[2:06:25] to the way it acts, the way it acted in
[2:06:27] the beginning. When you get in that 57
[2:06:29] Chevy and you want to turn that key,
[2:06:33] [Applause]
[2:06:37] Come on. You know you would.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; You'd lay down two black strips of
[2:06:46] rubber as quick as you could cuz you
[2:06:48] want to know if it would do what it did
[2:06:49] on the day it come out of the showroom.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; So why is it when we get back to God and
[2:06:54] God moves in our life, we ought to act
[2:06:56] the way we did when God first moved in
[2:06:58] our life? If you used to shout, somebody
[2:07:00] shout. If you used to dance, somebody
[2:07:02] dance. If you used to sing, somebody
[2:07:04] sing somebody praise the Lord.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; By doing these things,
[2:07:19] it increases its value.
[2:07:23] A $15 chair is now restored back to a
[2:07:27] $6,500 chair.
[2:07:29] a $500 rust bucket car is now restored
[2:07:33] into a $50,000 car. It It ensures it's
[2:07:38] it ensures increases its value and and
[2:07:41] ensures its longevity.
[2:07:46] Did you ever notice when you restore
[2:07:47] something, you just added new life back
[2:07:49] into it?
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; It can go another hundred years.
[2:07:59] What's God doing?
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Behave.
[2:08:06] What's God doing?
[2:08:09] God is is preparing a bride.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; He He He's ensuring that her value is
[2:08:16] increasing as she begins to believe the
[2:08:18] word.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Because of the life she lives, he's be
[2:08:23] she's beginning to act the way Christ
[2:08:25] acts.
[2:08:26] She's beginning to talk the way Christ
[2:08:28] talks. She's beginning to live the way
[2:08:31] Christ lived. And is ensuring her
[2:08:33] longevity because the bride of Christ is
[2:08:35] now without spot or wrinkle. And she
[2:08:38] lives forever and forever and forever
[2:08:42] eternal.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Elijah.
[2:08:55] Elijah went out and he was under the
[2:08:57] juniper tree. Brother Wayne Lawson
[2:09:00] mentioned this and the first time I
[2:09:02] think I'd ever heard it talked on
[2:09:04] preached on this way. And when I got to
[2:09:06] looking it up, Brother Brandham only
[2:09:08] preached on it this way one time.
[2:09:12] Elijah was sitting under the juniper
[2:09:14] tree
[2:09:17] and he was sitting under that juniper
[2:09:18] tree and he was so worn out
[2:09:21] and he thought to himself, "Nobody cares
[2:09:25] for me. Nobody comforts me. Nobody will
[2:09:30] comfort me." And he said he looked up to
[2:09:32] God and he said, "I am so tired and I am
[2:09:35] so weary. Why don't you just take me?
[2:09:44] Sometimes we feel that way. If we're
[2:09:46] honest,
[2:09:48] those thoughts cross our mind. I'm so
[2:09:51] tired. I'm so weary. Nothing's going
[2:09:53] Nothing's right. People's against me. Pe
[2:09:56] just take me. And he said, he says, just
[2:09:59] take me. And he said, there was that
[2:10:01] poor skinny grayhaired hanging down his
[2:10:05] shoulders. And God said, 'You just need
[2:10:07] a rest.'
[2:10:10] he needed a little restoration.
[2:10:13] And he said he he laid him down in the
[2:10:15] weeds under that juniper tree. And he
[2:10:20] said there was 10,000 angels watching
[2:10:23] him sleep.
[2:10:28] It gets it gets goodter and goodter.
[2:10:32] 10,000 angels.
[2:10:35] And he said, 'I can imagine out there on
[2:10:36] every limb all through the place was
[2:10:39] swarms of angels
[2:10:42] and here's Elijah sleeping,
[2:10:46] swarms of angels. And he said, God come
[2:10:48] down to him and said, "My poor little
[2:10:50] tired servant, he's so nervous and so
[2:10:52] torn up. I don't know what he don't know
[2:10:55] what to do." And listen what he says. I
[2:10:59] want to pick out
[2:11:01] the angel standing here that's got the
[2:11:04] softest hands.
[2:11:10] You know, when you go into cleaning
[2:11:12] stuff and restoring stuff, you take that
[2:11:16] soft cloth
[2:11:20] and and God begins to polish.
[2:11:24] You begin to polish and you begin to
[2:11:27] buff. You don't get something abrasive
[2:11:29] and rough and you don't scour sterling
[2:11:31] silver.
[2:11:36] I went back to my thrifter's house the
[2:11:38] other day
[2:11:40] and she had a
[2:11:42] sterling silver
[2:11:45] trophy cup. Onida,
[2:11:50] I'm going to get myself in trouble.
[2:11:53] I said, 'I need that.' She said, 'What
[2:11:56] do you want that for?' I said, 'Well,
[2:12:00] we had a little golf scramble and we're
[2:12:01] going to make it an annual thing at
[2:12:02] Brother Ron's and this is a perfect
[2:12:05] trophy cup and we're going to engrave
[2:12:08] the names in it and I need it.
[2:12:11] And it was just sy black. You ever seen
[2:12:13] tarnished silver?
[2:12:16] Sy black. Nasty, ugly.
[2:12:20] I actually thought, I don't know if I'll
[2:12:22] ever polish this thing out, but I said,
[2:12:24] I want it. She said, 'Well, take it. You
[2:12:25] just give me what it's worth. I don't
[2:12:28] know if that was the right thing to to
[2:12:29] agree to.
[2:12:33] Did I buy it? Am I paying what it was
[2:12:35] worth in the condition I bought it in or
[2:12:36] the condition it's in after I polished
[2:12:38] it?
[2:12:43] Uhoh. Am I done?
[2:12:53] So I took it home and I got me some
[2:12:58] silver polish and I got me a soft soft
[2:13:01] cloth and I began to wipe and I began to
[2:13:05] wipe in a little circle and the more I
[2:13:07] wiped the clearer it came. The more I
[2:13:08] wiped the clear it came and I wiped and
[2:13:10] I wiped and I said look at me.
[2:13:14] It was just like a mirror for an hour
[2:13:17] and a half, two hours. I sat there and I
[2:13:19] polished and I rubbed and I rubbed and I
[2:13:21] thought, "Boys, this is going to be
[2:13:22] beauty."
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; And I polished with that soft cloth. And
[2:13:27] that's what God says about Elijah. See,
[2:13:30] sometimes God, hey, we need God to just
[2:13:31] pull us up close and just woo us
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; and coup over us and to love us and
[2:13:37] restore us.
[2:13:40] And he said there there he was tired and
[2:13:42] he said, "I want to pick out an angel
[2:13:44] with the softest hands so he don't scare
[2:13:47] him." And he said he walked over there
[2:13:49] to Elijah and he told him to just go and
[2:13:52] stroke his brow real easy.
[2:13:56] You see, sometimes we're hurt.
[2:13:59] Sometimes we're damaged.
[2:14:01] Sometimes we we're we're we're just
[2:14:03] we're just not what we ought to be in
[2:14:05] God.
[2:14:07] And God sees that. And here was Elijah.
[2:14:10] And the angel began to to to stroke him
[2:14:12] on his brow. And he says, "And I want
[2:14:15] you to get the best cook amongst us."
[2:14:17] Did you know angels cooked?
[2:14:20] I want you to get the best cook amongst
[2:14:22] us and I want you to go in there and
[2:14:24] give him all the vitamins that you can
[2:14:27] find and put it in this cornmeal.
[2:14:34] the world has turned him down.
[2:14:39] You know, sometimes we're turned down as
[2:14:42] believers. We're shut down.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; We're turned down. We're discouraged.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; People don't want to hear what we got to
[2:14:48] say.
[2:14:50] Somebody the other day, I heard him say,
[2:14:52] "Yeah, you know, I go to church with my
[2:14:53] husband." Well, I'm just going to leave
[2:14:55] it alone.
[2:14:59] She wasn't even talking about us, but
[2:15:00] she said they preach on other religions
[2:15:03] and I don't like that.
[2:15:11] Let's just leave that. Leave it where it
[2:15:13] be.
[2:15:14] He says, "I'm going to go down and I'm
[2:15:16] going to treat him right." Hallelujah.
[2:15:18] He says, "Bring forth the best we got.
[2:15:21] Cook him a corn cake. Set him down some
[2:15:24] water." And this soft-handed angel went
[2:15:26] over and stroked this little servant of
[2:15:28] God on the brow.
[2:15:30] Remember,
[2:15:32] you've done your best.
[2:15:34] God still got those angels in order. He
[2:15:38] loves you. He loves you just as the same
[2:15:43] he loved Elijah.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; No different.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; God has never been a respector of
[2:15:51] persons. So what he did for Elijah, he
[2:15:55] can do for you.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; What he done for Daniel, he can do for
[2:16:01] you. What he done for David, he can do
[2:16:04] for you.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; What he done for the guy with the blind
[2:16:09] eyes, he can do for you.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; And he said, and he stroked his brow and
[2:16:15] Elijah woke up. Can you imagine waking
[2:16:17] up and there's an angel standing over
[2:16:18] you stroking your brow and cooking a
[2:16:20] corn cake?
[2:16:26] I'd be like, "What in the world is going
[2:16:29] on?"
[2:16:31] But he woke up and I may hear him say
[2:16:34] something like this. The Lord your God
[2:16:37] who loves you. You've done your best,
[2:16:40] Elijah. I only sent those signs for a
[2:16:43] witness that in the day of judgment
[2:16:44] they'll have to stand alone. You've done
[2:16:46] just as I told you to do. Sometimes we
[2:16:50] wonder, why do I do what I do? Why is
[2:16:52] God wanting me to do this? Why am I
[2:16:54] going in this direction? Elijah, you've
[2:16:57] only done what I've told you to do.
[2:17:02] Oh, don't you just hate technology?
[2:17:07] Tired and weary? The creator of heavens,
[2:17:11] the Lord God, the creator of heavens,
[2:17:13] has sent me to feed you this bread and
[2:17:16] this water.
[2:17:17] And he said Elijah was rubbing his eyes
[2:17:21] and he was rubbing his eyes trying to
[2:17:22] figure out what in the world. He's
[2:17:24] raising up a little oaf rail, shaking
[2:17:26] hands. And he said he took it and he
[2:17:28] took a piece of that bread and he ate
[2:17:30] it.
[2:17:31] And just then a great angelic choir came
[2:17:36] out.
[2:17:38] You see, sometimes we don't get close
[2:17:41] enough to God to allow him to sing to
[2:17:44] us.
[2:17:46] We don't sometimes don't get close
[2:17:48] enough to God to allow him just to come
[2:17:51] into our presence or we don't even get
[2:17:54] where we can just step into the presence
[2:17:56] of God because we're living whichever
[2:17:57] way we're too fast and we don't take
[2:17:59] time to feel his presence.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; We're all guilty.
[2:18:10] The angelic choir come out and formed a
[2:18:13] little panoramic around him and they
[2:18:15] began to sing the songs like no mother
[2:18:18] could coo her baby to sleep. Let him
[2:18:21] sleep again. Let him sleep again.
[2:18:25] Then the father turned around and said,
[2:18:27] "You know, I love him so much.
[2:18:34] I love him so much.
[2:18:38] When God looks down over the threshold
[2:18:40] and he looks at you in your in your
[2:18:43] distress
[2:18:44] and in your time of need and he looks
[2:18:47] and he says, "I need to send a special
[2:18:49] angel to them because I love him so
[2:18:54] much.
[2:19:00] I love him so much. He has got a lot to
[2:19:02] go through yet. So, I'm not through with
[2:19:04] him. Oh, see, you can't quit.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; There's no room for quitters in the
[2:19:10] kingdom of God.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; If you're a quitter, you ain't going to
[2:19:13] make it. I hate to tell you. So, when
[2:19:15] the times get tough and the struggles
[2:19:17] get hard and the road gets weary, you
[2:19:20] got to dig your heels in and say, "I
[2:19:22] refuse to quit. I'm going on with God.
[2:19:28] He's still got a work to do. I'm not
[2:19:30] through with him, so I must feed him
[2:19:32] again.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, we need to be fed
[2:19:35] again. We need the word of God more
[2:19:37] today than we did yesterday. Lord, feed
[2:19:40] us again.
[2:19:42] Give us our strength.
[2:19:44] He called the angels,
[2:19:53] my heavenly angels. Listen, can you
[2:19:56] imagine?
[2:19:58] I want you to feed him again.
[2:20:01] He needs more. And he says that the
[2:20:04] angels dumped in another big bunch of
[2:20:08] vitamins
[2:20:09] and cooked it up. And he cooked it up
[2:20:12] another corn and set him another cruise
[2:20:15] and began to stroke his brow again and
[2:20:16] fed him again.
[2:20:20] And he said, "I'm so glad that there's a
[2:20:23] juniper tree.
[2:20:28] We need a juniper tree.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we need God to come down and
[2:20:32] and do that for us and just give us that
[2:20:34] little bit of a juniper tree. We need to
[2:20:37] feel the presence of God. Sometimes we
[2:20:39] just need to know that he's in our
[2:20:40] midst.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just need to know that God
[2:20:44] is moving on the scene that we can
[2:20:46] actually feel him.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; I think Brother Ber preached about a the
[2:20:50] little quote where Brother Brown talks
[2:20:51] about a God with skin on him.
[2:20:54] Sometimes we need to feel it. We need
[2:20:56] our feelings to feel it.
[2:21:00] How many's ever been riding down the
[2:21:02] road and you're just in meditation and
[2:21:03] you're maybe listening to music and all
[2:21:05] of a sudden you just feel a presence.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; It's God coming down to stroke your
[2:21:11] brow.
[2:21:13] And you feel that presence and it's an
[2:21:15] anointing and you say, "I don't want
[2:21:17] this to leave.
[2:21:19] I don't want this anointing to go
[2:21:20] anywhere. I don't want it to stay right
[2:21:23] here.
[2:21:26] Sometimes God gives us special
[2:21:28] anointings, special feelings, special
[2:21:31] times, and we can recall them. One
[2:21:35] recently happened to me, and I'm going
[2:21:36] to share this with you. I believe sister
[2:21:37] Donna had a similar experience. So, when
[2:21:40] we were at Virginia,
[2:21:43] we were at Virginia and Brother Ron was
[2:21:45] able to visit with Brother Ron and he's
[2:21:47] been a buddy of mine for years and just
[2:21:48] a real mentor and just a special friend.
[2:21:53] First time I've ever got to go to his
[2:21:54] house. I've been to his church before,
[2:21:58] 18 years ago, and I tell the story like
[2:22:01] this. I was a young minister, and
[2:22:03] Brother Ron called me up to pray, and
[2:22:05] that one right there projectile vomited
[2:22:08] all down my suit coat.
[2:22:11] That's how my first experience at
[2:22:13] brother Ron Spencer's went.
[2:22:15] He was little then 18 years ago.
[2:22:21] But we went in. He says, "I want to show
[2:22:23] you my study."
[2:22:25] Sister Donna went in. Brother Ber went
[2:22:27] in at a different time. I was there with
[2:22:30] him by myself. He was showing me around.
[2:22:32] This is this and this is this and look
[2:22:34] at this deer. and just a beautiful study
[2:22:36] L how the Lord's blessed him and and art
[2:22:39] and just find just the Lord has really
[2:22:41] blessed him
[2:22:43] and he's telling me all of this stuff
[2:22:45] and and and and we stop in a certain
[2:22:47] spot in the room
[2:22:50] and it's doing it right now but every
[2:22:54] hair from my wrist to my ankles
[2:22:58] stood on edge
[2:23:01] and we were standing right there in the
[2:23:03] middle of this spot and he sitting there
[2:23:05] and he's pointing around this and this
[2:23:06] and this and this and this and he said,
[2:23:08] "But you know what the most amazing
[2:23:09] thing about this study is? What the most
[2:23:11] incredible thing about this study is?"
[2:23:14] And I said, "No." He said, "We're
[2:23:17] standing right where the angel of the
[2:23:18] Lord showed me and spoke to me that if I
[2:23:22] would just keep going, however he puts
[2:23:24] it, if I would just keep on going,
[2:23:26] there's a greater work for me."
[2:23:29] Let me tell you, when he said that, I
[2:23:31] thought I was going to come unglued.
[2:23:34] But it was stepping into a presence.
[2:23:37] We need that presence.
[2:23:41] We need that restoration from time to
[2:23:43] time.
[2:23:44] We need those special moments. And I
[2:23:48] want you to think and and we're running.
[2:23:49] We're running tight. I I I got 21 pages.
[2:23:52] I'm on page eight. So,
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; but think about the Garden of Eden.
[2:23:58] We'll try to get through the Garden of
[2:23:59] Eden here. And and in the Garden of
[2:24:01] Eden, God begins to create in this
[2:24:03] garden the original plan of God. He
[2:24:06] creates the light and and he turns
[2:24:09] darkness and and and night and light
[2:24:11] into day and he he creates the firmament
[2:24:13] and he takes the the dry ground and
[2:24:15] calls it land. I'm just paraphrasing. He
[2:24:17] goes through and he builds the seeds and
[2:24:19] the vegetation and the plants and the
[2:24:21] seeding plants and he keeps on going and
[2:24:23] going and living creatures begin to
[2:24:25] come. And on day six, he creates the
[2:24:27] animals. And he creates these animals to
[2:24:30] live on the land and the human beings
[2:24:32] male and female created he them.
[2:24:35] And after all this is done he rested.
[2:24:37] But in the verse 31 it says God saw that
[2:24:40] everything he had made and behold it was
[2:24:43] very good.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; It was very good. And the evening and
[2:24:48] the morning were the sixth day. So in
[2:24:50] that garden of Eden in God's original
[2:24:52] mind and in his plan and his intent
[2:24:55] there was no sickness.
[2:24:58] There was no pain. There was no anger,
[2:25:01] no hatred, no envy, no jealousy, no
[2:25:04] malice.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Think about this. There was no no
[2:25:09] hospitals.
[2:25:10] There was no sirens.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; There was no police.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; There was no gangsters.
[2:25:21] Well, there was one creep in
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; but at this point there was nothing
[2:25:28] there but joy and peace and love and
[2:25:31] unity and fellowship and harmony
[2:25:37] everything just like God intended it to
[2:25:39] be. And brother Brandham said it right
[2:25:41] there in that was the greatest
[2:25:43] fellowship that any mortal had ever
[2:25:45] seen. and and even to this day is to be
[2:25:47] in the very presence of almighty God.
[2:25:51] That's the greatest fellowship. No
[2:25:52] fellowship, he said, can take its place.
[2:25:55] There's something about being in that
[2:25:57] presence. And he said, at one time, man
[2:25:59] had perfect fellowship with God.
[2:26:03] Can you imagine what it was like in the
[2:26:06] Garden of Eden?
[2:26:09] Perfect fellowship.
[2:26:11] He said, ' That's the reason you crave
[2:26:14] it in your heart.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; Why is it you want to be close to God?
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Because you was in the mind of God.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Why is it that you want to worship God?
[2:26:28] Because you were in the mind of God the
[2:26:31] way it was in the original before the
[2:26:33] foundation of the world. He said, "There
[2:26:35] they are. There's my children. There's
[2:26:36] my bride. and you want to worship.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've I' I've ministered to
[2:26:44] heathens around the nations." He said,
[2:26:46] "They don't know right from wrong. They
[2:26:47] don't know any of this." He said, "But
[2:26:49] one thing they do is they will worship
[2:26:51] some kind of God because it's a craven
[2:26:54] on the inside." Whether it's a sun god,
[2:26:57] whether it's a moon god, whether it's an
[2:26:59] idol, an image, whatever it is, that's
[2:27:01] why we are called to worship.
[2:27:08] So let me ask you this morning, what are
[2:27:10] we worshiping?
[2:27:11] [Music]
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; Where does our worship lie?
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; Where does our worship lie or what are
[2:27:18] we placing in the forefront of our
[2:27:20] lives? What are we placing in front of
[2:27:23] God?
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; What about our hobbies?
[2:27:30] H
[2:27:32] what about our relationships?
[2:27:35] What good does it do a young man and a
[2:27:37] young woman to to to like each other and
[2:27:40] get together and like each other and and
[2:27:43] have plans for the future if they don't
[2:27:44] have God in their life?
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; It don't do them a lot of good because
[2:27:51] they're setting theirel up for a road of
[2:27:53] hardship, a road of heartache. They need
[2:27:56] to make sure, young people, listen to
[2:27:57] me. You need to make sure that your life
[2:27:59] has got the Holy Ghost involved before
[2:28:02] you start dating somebody.
[2:28:05] More importantly, make sure their life
[2:28:07] is filled with the Holy Ghost. Because
[2:28:10] if you get somebody that's not filled
[2:28:12] with the Holy Ghost, that don't want to
[2:28:14] serve this our Lord and don't want to
[2:28:16] follow this message, it's going to be a
[2:28:18] hard road to hoe.
[2:28:24] What are your activities?
[2:28:27] What kind of activities are keeping you
[2:28:29] out of the house of God?
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; It's easy.
[2:28:36] I said earlier, we our our kids, we want
[2:28:39] everything. We want our kids to have
[2:28:40] everything. We want them to to
[2:28:42] participate in everything. We want them
[2:28:44] to be the best at everything. We want
[2:28:45] them to do this and do that. We run all
[2:28:48] over the country with our kids. And we
[2:28:50] were talking about it the other day and
[2:28:51] I thought, Lord, if I had the money that
[2:28:54] I had spent on baseball bats, baseball
[2:28:57] gloves,
[2:29:00] uniforms, jerseys, tennis shoes, cleats.
[2:29:07] You know, my boys been saying shoes too
[2:29:09] long. They had to have a new pair about
[2:29:10] every six months cuz they wearing
[2:29:12] canoes.
[2:29:17] You didn't know you was going to get
[2:29:18] this treatment when you come home, did
[2:29:19] you, son?
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; Love you, buddy.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; But we try to put all this stuff in the
[2:29:26] forefront. What is pulling us away from
[2:29:28] our real true joy?
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; I found out with my kids, I I thought
[2:29:35] they was going to be able to pay me back
[2:29:37] because they was going to go pro.
[2:29:41] I found out there's a lot better kids
[2:29:43] than they are playing baseball.
[2:29:49] And they was good.
[2:29:54] I didn't get no money back.
[2:29:59] But what is it? We say that we laugh
[2:30:01] because we've all been there.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; And we get caught in that rhythm
[2:30:06] and we think we're happy.
[2:30:10] We think we're happy,
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; but what is keeping us from church? Is
[2:30:15] does our jobs does our jobs require all
[2:30:18] of our attention? Is our jobs keeping us
[2:30:20] out?
[2:30:22] Is you know, some people it's it's an
[2:30:25] amazing thing.
[2:30:29] People will call into church
[2:30:34] with a toothache. They'll call into
[2:30:37] church
[2:30:39] if they run out of milk.
[2:30:42] I had to go to the store. I had to get
[2:30:43] some milk. We got to have creamer and
[2:30:44] milk in our coffee. I had to go. I just
[2:30:46] had no choice but to go to town. Can't
[2:30:49] be there. But they will not call in for
[2:30:52] work.
[2:30:54] They will not let the employer down.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; You say, "How do you know that?" Cuz I
[2:31:03] was one of those. I never missed a day
[2:31:06] of work. You know how many days? Some of
[2:31:08] you probably think maybe I've said it
[2:31:09] before. How many days of high school I
[2:31:10] missed?
[2:31:13] Anybody want you want you guess how many
[2:31:15] did I miss? How many days of high school
[2:31:17] do you think I missed?
[2:31:19] Wrong. Zero.
[2:31:22] Perfect attendance.
[2:31:24] Anybody else had perfect attendance?
[2:31:29] Adriana, you did not have perfect
[2:31:30] attendance.
[2:31:33] You know what happens to liars?
[2:31:40] But they'll call in to church. I can't
[2:31:44] be here. I can't be at the gathering. I
[2:31:46] can't be at the special meetings.
[2:31:49] I I
[2:31:52] It just floores me.
[2:31:55] It floores me. People People want to say
[2:31:58] they're so committed
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; until the time for commitment comes.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; You know, God longs.
[2:32:11] He longs for our fellowship.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; He longs for a reciprocating love.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Do you ever notice it? And no matter if
[2:32:20] how far astray you get from God, how far
[2:32:23] away you get from God, once you just
[2:32:25] call out to his name, his love is right
[2:32:27] there.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; His love never left. He's right there.
[2:32:32] He's waiting. He's calling. He's He's
[2:32:33] petitioning you to come back. Come back.
[2:32:35] Come back.
[2:32:38] But he wants that love to go both ways.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; I I just wonder how many times God goes
[2:32:45] to sleep. If we were to say goes to bed
[2:32:48] and we never said good night.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, we never said good morning.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, we never said thank you for this
[2:33:00] Lord. Thank you for that.
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the new job. Thank you for
[2:33:04] the new clothes. Thank you for the new
[2:33:06] shoes. Thank you for the new house.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you for everything. You see, God
[2:33:14] wants to fellowship. God wants to share
[2:33:16] himself with us. And that's the way it
[2:33:18] was in the garden of e in in in the
[2:33:20] garden of Eden. Perfect fellowship.
[2:33:24] The prophet tells the story. He would
[2:33:26] come down in the late in the afternoon,
[2:33:27] in the cool of the evening, in the
[2:33:29] evening time when the twilights was
[2:33:30] falling and Jehovah would come across
[2:33:32] the top of the palm trees roaring like a
[2:33:34] thunder.
[2:33:36] When's the last time we heard God
[2:33:38] roaring like a thunder?
[2:33:42] Slow down, people.
[2:33:46] slow down and listen. He said, "And
[2:33:49] there was Adam and Eve gathered out
[2:33:50] there in that great open air cathedral,
[2:33:53] worshiping God."
[2:33:55] Worshiping God and having fellowship and
[2:33:58] talking to him. Everything was perfect.
[2:34:00] No anxiety. There's nothing to worry
[2:34:03] about.
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; No sickness.
[2:34:08] Everybody was healthy.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Only peace and joy and happiness and
[2:34:13] love. He said, "The lion and the tigers,
[2:34:15] they would all come around in perfect
[2:34:17] harmony." He said, "Wouldn't that be a
[2:34:19] perfect wonderful place to live?" Can
[2:34:22] you imagine?
[2:34:24] I seen a little snake last night and
[2:34:26] down there in my greenhouse. That thing
[2:34:28] I jumped, I thought, man, thank God it
[2:34:30] wasn't a copperhead. I was all in that
[2:34:31] thing.
[2:34:34] You didn't They didn't worry about that
[2:34:35] in the Garden of Eden. The lion laid
[2:34:37] down with the lamb and the l and
[2:34:39] everything was just perfect. All things
[2:34:41] are working in in harmony. He said, "In
[2:34:43] perfect harmony,
[2:34:45] everything in perfect harmony. God in
[2:34:47] harmony with his creature and the
[2:34:48] creature in harmony with his maker."
[2:34:53] What a perfect fellowship.
[2:34:56] But here's where it gets sticky.
[2:34:59] Here's where it gets sticky.
[2:35:02] It gets sticky right here when he says,
[2:35:04] "But then man began to sin
[2:35:08] and separated himself from God.
[2:35:12] And he began to separate himself from
[2:35:15] his fellowship. He began to separate
[2:35:18] himself from his maker. And he said it
[2:35:21] was sin that separates. Brothers and
[2:35:22] sisters, we don't need any separation in
[2:35:25] our lives from God. We need to get
[2:35:27] closer and closer and God give us more
[2:35:30] and more and create a desire in my life
[2:35:32] and in my heart that I want more of you
[2:35:35] God. Amen.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; More of the truth, more of this, more
[2:35:39] fellowship.
[2:35:41] And he said, "Adam and Eve was the most
[2:35:43] perfect couple that ever walked on
[2:35:44] earth." How many of you could say that
[2:35:46] about your spouse?
[2:35:52] The most perfect couple that ever walked
[2:35:54] on earth. He said, "I can see Adam not
[2:35:58] he was a perfect built man and Eve was
[2:36:00] beautiful." I love it when he says this.
[2:36:03] And I see her now as she woke up from
[2:36:05] her little operation from Adam.
[2:36:11] God performed that little operation.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I can see it as she looked
[2:36:17] as as they as she woke up and her
[2:36:19] beautiful eyes and Adam looked down on
[2:36:20] her and her beautiful hair hanging down
[2:36:22] her back and her eyes sparkling like the
[2:36:24] stars. And Adam looked at her and said,
[2:36:27] "You're bone of my bone and flesh of my
[2:36:31] flesh."
[2:36:32] Can you imagine that? How he must have
[2:36:34] felt when he grabbed that love into his
[2:36:36] arm and he said he carried her away. He
[2:36:38] grabbed her and pulled her up and he
[2:36:40] carried and they looked but they were so
[2:36:41] pretty. She was so pretty. She was
[2:36:45] perfect.
[2:36:48] He said there she was a beautiful
[2:36:49] species and here they are sweethearts
[2:36:53] and God performing a a marriage ceremony
[2:36:56] right there before him. And he said they
[2:36:58] were perfect God's children.
[2:37:02] She hung on to his arm.
[2:37:06] Think about this scene. As she hangs on
[2:37:09] to his arm and they walk through the
[2:37:10] garden to the great garden, he says of
[2:37:12] God, perfect in love. No harm, no danger
[2:37:15] could ever come near them. And they're
[2:37:17] walking and strolling through the Garden
[2:37:18] of Eden.
[2:37:21] Everything is perfect. Everything's
[2:37:22] wonderful. Everything's good. Nothing to
[2:37:25] harm them, Brother Woody.
[2:37:28] And all of a sudden, but here's an
[2:37:30] enemy.
[2:37:32] He said, "The enemy that come in to
[2:37:33] pervert the thing into a regular mess
[2:37:36] that we're in today."
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; Just that quick, when the enemy came in,
[2:37:42] just that quick, things begin to change.
[2:37:44] He said it was when Adam sinned right
[2:37:46] there. It's when we got wrinkled face.
[2:37:48] It's when we got funeral processions.
[2:37:50] It's when when the hospital screams. And
[2:37:52] that's the devil that did that.
[2:37:57] And you wonder, and we wonder sometimes
[2:37:59] why our lives sometimes go down these
[2:38:01] roads.
[2:38:07] Adam sinned.
[2:38:10] Look at Eve, he says,
[2:38:12] around that beautiful body of hers is
[2:38:14] wrapped in old bloody sheep skin.
[2:38:18] Because God called him out of the bushes
[2:38:20] and said, Adam, Adam, where are thou?
[2:38:23] You know the story. and they were hid.
[2:38:25] And the prophet said he comes and he
[2:38:27] throws them some bloody lamb skkins.
[2:38:32] He throws those bloody lamb skins to
[2:38:34] them. Brother Ber throws it to him and
[2:38:36] says, "Cover yourself."
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; And they begin to be dripping. And he
[2:38:40] said, "There's Adam standing there,
[2:38:42] muscles in his arms, muscles in his
[2:38:44] legs, shaggy hair around his shoulder,
[2:38:46] his dark beard hanging, a perfect man.
[2:38:48] But look at it now. His shoulders
[2:38:50] stupid.
[2:38:53] his shoulders stooping around his big
[2:38:55] body comes an old bloody sheep skin
[2:38:57] running down those manly legs comes
[2:39:00] blood and tears is dripping off his
[2:39:03] cheeks
[2:39:05] and he's patting Eve on the top of the
[2:39:07] head and leans over to her bosom and and
[2:39:10] and Eve is crying.
[2:39:13] He said Eve is crying and the tears are
[2:39:15] patting down and mixes with the blood.
[2:39:17] What's the matter? Something's happened.
[2:39:19] They are now crying.
[2:39:25] The first tear ever shed.
[2:39:28] The first day of sorrow ever lived. The
[2:39:32] first day of regret
[2:39:35] ever lived. The first time they felt
[2:39:37] aches in their bones ever lived.
[2:39:42] Why? Because they got out of harmony
[2:39:44] with God. That's right.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; They got out of fellowship with God.
[2:39:51] And brother Brandham says, I can see God
[2:39:53] look there and say, "Depart out of my
[2:39:56] presence."
[2:39:58] Oh, can you imagine?
[2:40:01] Depart out of my presence.
[2:40:05] And brother Brandham says
[2:40:08] Adam's walking away and he could hear
[2:40:13] that bloody sheep skin
[2:40:16] every step he took
[2:40:18] smacking him on the leg. And that bloody
[2:40:21] sheep skin was going down and the blood
[2:40:24] was running off
[2:40:27] and he couldn't stand to see his
[2:40:29] children depart from him.
[2:40:32] How many of you ever had to correct your
[2:40:34] child or scold your child and they run
[2:40:37] away in shame or tears and you think,
[2:40:40] "Oh, I hate that. I hate to do that."
[2:40:44] We have, you have, we all have. We hate
[2:40:48] to see that.
[2:40:50] And he says he couldn't stand to see his
[2:40:52] children depart from him that way. And
[2:40:55] he says, "I'm going to make a covenant."
[2:40:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:40:59] I'm going to make a covenant. I'm going
[2:41:01] to make a covenant between your seed and
[2:41:03] the woman's seed and between your seed
[2:41:06] and the Satan's seed. I'm going to make
[2:41:07] that covenant. What was it? It was a
[2:41:09] promise. It was a promise that God gave
[2:41:12] and said, "It won't always be this way,
[2:41:14] my child.
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; It won't always be hardship. It won't
[2:41:18] always be suffering. It won't always be
[2:41:20] hospitals. It won't always be sickness.
[2:41:23] It won't always be discouragement."
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. because I know a lamb.
[2:41:30] Because I know a lamb. And the prophet
[2:41:33] said, he what is it now? 4,000 years
[2:41:36] later. He said, 4,000 years later up in
[2:41:39] Jerusalem, he's you can look out the
[2:41:41] window and he said, I hear a noise.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; I hear a noise and I hear a screaming
[2:41:46] and a hollering, a mob that's a
[2:41:48] hollering and people are coming against
[2:41:50] it. And he said, "I raised the shades to
[2:41:52] look out the window, and coming through
[2:41:54] the streets was an old rugged cross
[2:41:56] bouncing down the cobblestones."
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's a familiar sound.
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; Bouncing down the cobblestones. It
[2:42:04] wasn't sheep skin this time, smacking
[2:42:06] their legs and bleeding down and and and
[2:42:08] ridden with tears. But it was a bloody
[2:42:11] cross that was bouncing off the
[2:42:12] cobblestones headed up to a place called
[2:42:15] Calvary.
[2:42:19] He said, "Look at those little red
[2:42:20] spots. What are they? They're getting
[2:42:22] bigger and bigger and bigger until they
[2:42:24] finally run into one spot."
[2:42:26] He said, "What is it?"
[2:42:29] He said, "There goes the second Adam."
[2:42:35] You see, God don't leave us in an
[2:42:37] unfinished state.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; God don't leave us in a in a life of
[2:42:42] disarray. God ain't going to leave us in
[2:42:45] a in a life of sickness.
[2:42:48] But he provided a second Adam. He said,
[2:42:50] "Here's that second Adam. His own blood
[2:42:52] hitting his legs." He said, "The second
[2:42:55] Adam one was a one. The first Adam
[2:42:57] brought death. The second one brings
[2:42:59] life."
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the second Adam. Thank God
[2:43:04] for Jesus Christ and a place called
[2:43:06] Calvary.
[2:43:11] Adam and Eve. It won't always be that
[2:43:13] way. It won't always be that way because
[2:43:16] the second Adam came and he said there
[2:43:19] there was that blood. There was that
[2:43:21] blood. The son of God going to Calvary
[2:43:23] to bear the sins.
[2:43:27] Not just Adam, not just Eve,
[2:43:30] but you and you and me and you and you
[2:43:33] and you and you.
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; You was on his mind.
[2:43:46] making his mystery known to the bride.
[2:43:51] We'll close with this. Making his
[2:43:53] mystery known to his bride,
[2:43:57] redeemed by Christ, the second Adam,
[2:44:00] going back home to be restored to the
[2:44:04] original Eden.
[2:44:06] How many say, "I want to go back to that
[2:44:08] original Eden. I want to go back to a
[2:44:10] place to where I have no more hardship,
[2:44:12] no more anger, no more no more grief, no
[2:44:15] more sorrow, no more sickness, no more
[2:44:17] pain.
[2:44:20] I want to go back." And he said, "There
[2:44:22] he was going back home to be restored to
[2:44:24] that original Eden, free from death,
[2:44:26] free from sickness, free from sorrow and
[2:44:28] shame, going back with eternal life."
[2:44:33] Let's stand to our feet.
[2:44:40] It's been a long day in the Lord for us.
[2:44:44] We usually don't go this long,
[2:44:47] but I can say it's been good to be in
[2:44:49] the house of the Lord.
[2:44:51] [Applause]
[2:45:00] Malachi 4 5 and 6 was sent to turn our
[2:45:05] hearts.
[2:45:06] You was on his mind. Let's keep him on
[2:45:10] our mind.
[2:45:11] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we
[2:45:14] come before you this morning, Lord, with
[2:45:15] thankful hearts for the message you laid
[2:45:18] on our heart. And we trust it was

[2:45:22] I just desire a closer walk with you,
[2:45:25] Lord. And I desire a a a more of a
[2:45:28] fullness in life that you have for me,
[2:45:30] Lord. I just want to be what you want me
[2:45:33] to be. Lord, I thank you, Lord, for that
[2:45:36] second Adam,
[2:45:38] for Jesus Christ. as Jesus Christ walked
[2:45:41] up that cobblestone road packing the
[2:45:43] cross that I should have been packing.
[2:45:47] Lord, I thank you for your restoring
[2:45:49] work, your restoration, that this is a

[2:46:28] the anointing of God is with us today.
[2:46:31] [Music]

[2:46:37] say, "God, I need more of you. God, I
[2:46:40] want to restore. I want you to restore
[2:46:42] the joy that I once had. I want you to
[2:46:44] restore the love that I once had in my
[2:46:46] heart for you. I want that love that I
[2:46:48] once had. I want I want it to be
[2:46:50] restored so that my kids can see, so
[2:46:52] that the world can see, so that my
[2:46:55] employer can see,
[2:46:58] but more importantly, so that you can
[2:47:00] see that I love you, Lord, with all my
[2:47:02] heart.

[2:47:22] and them, Lord.
[2:47:24] I pray, Lord, that you'll grant their
[2:47:26] heart's desire.
[2:47:29] I pray, Lord, that you'll restore
[2:47:32] whatever they're lacking or whatever. If
[2:47:33] it's their joy, restore their joy. If
[2:47:36] it's their love, restore their love. If
[2:47:38] it's their home, restore their home
[2:47:40] life.
[2:47:41] If they've just gotten cold on you or
[2:47:43] put other things before you, restore,
[2:47:45] Lord, that joy of their salvation so
[2:47:48] that they could praise and worship and
