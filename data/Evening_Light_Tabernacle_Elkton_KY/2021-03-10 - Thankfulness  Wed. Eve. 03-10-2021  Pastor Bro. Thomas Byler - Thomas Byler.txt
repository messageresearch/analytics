appreciate it seems just a wee bit a little bit darker than usual up here for some reason amen let's bow our heads lord jesus we once again approach your throne of grace lord thank the lord jesus on this midweek service to be able to come together lord and father take a little trip down lord the word the path of the word father and just see where it will lead us lord jesus and see what we can learn from it lord and where it will guide us father we just ask god for your leadership and guidance now tonight ask god that you'd help me lord jesus as i just try to convey lord that which i feel you've laid upon my heart to speak bless the reading of the word father inspire us bless the hears of the hearer lord jesus father both here and on the internet we ask god that you just be with each and every person tonight in jesus name name we ask it amen and amen and thank the lord for touching brother stephen amen that he's doing better so that's all good amen amen let's turn to luke 17. luke 17. and colossians 3 15. luke 17 beginning with verse 12. and as he entered into a certain village there met him 10 men that were lepers switched to the far off and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was and he was a samaritan and jesus answered and said where were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger and he said unto him arise and go thy way that faith has made the whole in colossians three colossians 3. verse 15 and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to which also you are called in one body and be ye thankful may god had his blessings to read in the words you can be seated tonight i want to speak on a subject that i've probably spoken on here many times but i want to speak on it again because this morning as i was just concentrating and meeting meditating on the lord i mean this is the thought that came to me amen so tonight we want to speak on thankfulness thankfulness amen amen in everything give thanks amen in everything and so i was thinking about the state of being thankful first of all we realize that to be thankful is actually a state that a person is in it's a state just kind of like you know when we get over to heaven we know that what's going to make heaven heaven is the state that you're in amen just your this your state of being amen and i read that part also i didn't even know that that was in that same verse but today as i was working and doing a few different things and the wind was just blowing and whistling and you know especially in the wintertime that wind can sound kind of spooky and you know kind of haunting and you know and so but you know the thought that came to me i was just like well you know i'm so glad that i don't have to be haunted i don't have to be feeling condemned i don't have to feel bad or i don't have to be spooky in my spirit i just felt that peace in my heart you know and i thought about that scripture came to me but it says let the peace of god rule i like that let it rule your life let it rule you amen control you it also is a state of being i mean knows that it's a part of being a state of being amen tonight talking about thankfulness i truly believe that this is one of the large uh one of the large characters all right parts of our character it is a part of our characters many different aspects to character but being thankful is a large part of a character that god is looking for amen in each and every one of us so with the help of the lord tonight for a little while we want to go and use different illustrations and the one main one probably that i want to use will be the apostle paul amen and i wrote down here is i just got the meditating and i got to thinking about what satisfy i mean what where's my other paper being satisfied okay found it all the way under everything all right the state of being thankful what leads to that and what causes a person to be thankful a thankful person amen first of all we realize that for our person uh to be thankful first of all you have to be content amen you have to be happy all right what leads to discontent actually yeah and content actually is a state to where you're satisfied amen in other words for content would be satisfied you're satisfied am i right now all of these all of these other words the opposite of being content would be discontent and how many knows that discontent would be would bring dissatisfaction it you surely wouldn't be thankful for your discontented state right you wouldn't be satisfied well thank you lord for letting me be dissatisfied no you just wouldn't match with it wouldn't work right no it means that you're satisfied amen brother brethren he makes a statement and identified with christ he says you know there in this in this here country today there is so many dissatisfied people amen now we all know that when you take uh for granted the things that you have you're not happy you're not satisfied with the good things that you have i mean those most likely you're even gonna lose those good things and we see in our nation today that people are not content with the liberties that they have amen they're not content with the liberty they're not satisfied with the liberties that they have and you know it's quite something how and i'm just going to put a little bit of my own in here and you forgive me but you know we have a congress and i'm i guess they're the ones that are supposed to be uh making laws there are lawmakers you nearly be busy busy busy busy busy busy making making laws making more laws making more laws i don't know about you but i thought already i said let's take a break you know because more laws just means more more rules more things you got to follow do this do that do this do that you know until when are they going to stop making laws pretty soon we'll be like most other countries that you can't blow your nose without a permit i mean it's bad you go to canada go to other places you know but they're making laws they're doing all these things but we know and you know they've made me we already know that they've made so many laws that it disaffects most of the laws they made and you know they're just never satisfied this world the america not just america but the world over people are dissatisfied they're discontent and they are not thankful thankful being thankful means you're in a state of satisfaction you're satisfied you're happy we find that there's a lot of people that are not happy and that's sad because we ought to be the happiest people on the earth we ought to be the most contented people on the face of the earth most and you know people are just never satisfied no matter how good people get it they're still not satisfied now let me just say this the reason that i mentioned a minute ago that being satisfied and being thankful is part of a major part of our character and we know that god in all of this uh is looking for character to live with for eternity that's what he's looking for and the only thing that we're going to take with us when we draw our last breath it's not our money not a bigger bank account it's nothing you're gonna take nothing with you except your character that's all you can take with you amen and so i truly believe that people are so busy getting stuff getting rich so busy with getting more that they forgot what real prosperity is what real prosperity is can anybody think about what real prosperity is in a scriptural sense something the bible says something that's great cain huh we'll read it after a while but the bible says godliness with contentment is great gain in other words if you're godly and you're content you have gained a whole lot you're real rich you've really gotten somewhere in life if you're godly and you're content godliness with contentment pulse that is great gain we'll get into that a little bit but i truly believe that it's part of a a christian and it's it's a it's a beautiful it's a beautiful beautiful beautiful place to be a place to where you're just a thankful person thankfulness is also a very very very positive thing it's not negative at all not negative it's it's totally positive and remember this that the holy spirit is always positive never negative nobody likes to live with a discontented mate a unhappy mate huh unsatisfied mate because we know what comes with that murmuring complaining nothing's ever gone my it's just a horrible person to live with i think brother baby said he says god don't never let the devil crown my life being a crabby old man or let my wife be a crabby old woman amen no never let the devil crown your life with that and that goes for us young people too don't let him crown with your life with being crabby and i i thought about a person that had this had this state i'm going to call it a state of thankfulness they live people that live in a state of thankfulness live in a state of satisfaction it's people that you like to be around i like to be around somebody that's satisfied i like when my wife is satisfied huh it's my job to make sure my wife is satisfied huh isn't that right god doesn't want to live up there with a dissatisfied person huh and you know most people think that they're satisfied when everything might they have what they want everything is going good right there's no adversity everything's on the mountaintop huh it's good and easy to be thankful on the mountaintop everything going good right but god wants more out of us than to be thankful just on a mountaintop when things are going good because we know that god has designed this world this world has been created and designed with adversity all right this world is created with adversity i mean having to get up and go to work and then it doesn't go right you get a flat tire on the way to work and you hurt yourself changing the tire everything can go wrong will go wrong murphy says so that's right so god created adversity he created adversity so much until not everything's going to always go good and so it's going to get easy to be a complainer easy to be unhappy to easy to be unthankful amen easy because of the adversity that is in the world but you know in the middle of all of that and i want to talk in a minute i'll bring it up but when you're a thankful person you're like the lady that always had something good to say about somebody how many of us when you when you when you're a thankful person even brother bam says if you can't say something good about somebody don't say anything at all never say something negative about somebody okay and so they this man did he said hey you know we'll get this lady we'll get her we'll get her to say something negative about somebody right and it says lady what about the devil huh and she had something good to say about him she said well he's a good adversary right he's a good adversary my mama she was so positive amen and she'd probably be saying but i thank the lord for delivering him from my adversary huh okay so praise the lord that's right to be satisfied a place of satisfied and you know it's not about whether or not everything is going good for you that you should be content and satisfied and a thankful person that right let me just mention before i use paul for my illa main illustration tonight i want to use him for my main illustration but i want to talk to you about one other person that really went down into pages of history american history as a hero it was stonewall jackson huh and he was asked why in the world how can you just stand there bullets and arrows flying by you and all this that or the other and you just stand there like a stone whoa i don't know about you but i think i would think you need to move right brother move you know so that it can't be a hard target to hit but just to stand there and hold the line just directing his men and so forth stonewall jackson had to be completely satisfied of where he was huh in the middle of getting arrows flung by your head and everything else hatchets flying by you who knows what all and he kicked this they asked this question what why why do you do this now how can you do this he kicked the ground with his foot and what did he say i don't never take a drink of water without thanking the lord for he was a thankful guy he was content and happy with the state that he was in where he was at see being thankful it is not whether everything's going good and you got something special just out of the other but it's a state of being someplace being the state that you are and i want to tell you that place the secret place that that is and that we all want to be and that is in christ jesus when you're in him folks when you are in christ you can be a thankful person because it don't matter life death good time bad time no matter what comes or goes you're a thankful person because why you're in heavenly places in christ jesus and he must have been ready to gold and the second the arrow struck him through his heart or wherever it was he was ready to go because he had a relationship with the master and truly he did what the scripture says in all things give thanks i like that song give thanks with a grateful heart amen when we come to the house of god like the song says i will enter his gates with thanksgiving gratitude it's also a form of worship because remember when that leper fell down he worshipped from god and glorified god and was thanking him thank you thank you thank you lord amen for opening my eyes the others were such a state of being thankful for their eyesight but they forgot where it came from jesus says where's the others at huh amen so we look at him look at look at him and snowball jackson how where he must have been in that place there's that place i truly believe that we can get locked in behind the holies of holies whenever you receive the holy spirit amen the world should become shut off to you you don't hear all the sounds of the world and everything else amen yeah i don't know about you but i need to get shut in with god more people don't realize i don't realize even i was telling my wife on the way to work to way to work well tonight's work so here i am the way to church i said you know you know honey i says i really you know because yesterday we got to drive and do something me and my son and so forth and and on the way just to listen to gospel music and to meditate and just just to have that music how many knows music inspires just to be in that atmosphere of music and prayer and talking to the lord and it really does something to you and if you get too busy and i do i get too busy to where you can take an hour or two and just get away basking songs bask in prayer basket talking to the lord huh it makes a huge difference in everything about you if you're nervous if you're upset but it'll just calm you right down amen just like these thoughts that come here and i said honey i get my messages in that presence and so forth and he gives me all these things you know it begins to pour out but i need to spend more time i mean would be with me we really need to spend more time in the presence of god and i grant you we'll be thankful because that's the only thing that really gives you strength and so forth amen praise the lord so it's not being thankful it's not in having everything just right and everything good right but it's in being in the lord that's what it's all about it's being in christ that makes you a thankful person amen some so many times in the world that you and i are living in people are not thankful doesn't matter how much they get people with a you know you take people that have become a billionaire they weren't thankful with 1 million 2 million had to be 100 million not 100 million with a thousand million a billion you know that it's one billion so money can it never satisfies they're never content with what they have they always have to have more amen there's only one thing that brings contentment and that is having peace with god there's nothing that'll bring contentment in your life like having peace with god well because if you're not at peace with god folks you're never going to be content i mean until you get right with god the way you're supposed to be you're never going to have contentment you're never going to be no person you're not going to be satisfied you find a person that says satisfied remember to not right with god huh that's why brother bam says the hospitals are full of them there's so people everywhere the insane institutions are my you know people taking drugs and all these they're not satisfied they're not content they're not happy amen they're not thankful amen because why because they're not in the right place he says you know the insane institutions are overrun dissatisfied they don't know what do they want to do there seems just to be something that they're reaching after but they never come to it amen how many wants to come to it i want to come to that place where all that comes forth from me is gratefulness to god for what he does and for what he needs means absolutely taking full benefits we're beneficiaries of what christ did for us on calvary okay let's go to paul let's talk about paul for a little bit all right number one will be second corinthians 11. second corinthians 11. i mean it was paul he really had a hard life even when jesus talked to him he talked about how i'm going to show you all the things that you're going to suffer from my name's sake what an introduce what an introduction to a ministry christ telling you you're going to suffer a lot of things for me second corinthians 11 verse 22 are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more in laborers more abundant in stripes above measure in imprisons more frequent and deaths often of the jews five times received i 40 stripes save one five times thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned my thrice three times i suffered shipwreck come on folks people say paul you ain't living right you cannot be living right three times every time you get don't get on the water ball you're gonna go down huh don't go over to that city you're gonna get stoned you're gonna get beat yeah i know i'm used to it yeah you think the lord delivered for me all this no he didn't paul had a reason to complain matter of fact i thought about adding a chapter to acts or hebrews and writing out what paul could have complained about and how he could have wrote a chapter of complaining and being unthankful but paul never did any a night and a day i have been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of water in perils of robbers amen i was proud of my granddaughter donna said that elena came to her and says donna i already had my devotions i just had my devotion she can read and she says well what did you find out what did you read you know how dominant is find out what the child knows if you're going to the only well i read where they they said they would not eat or drink and they had until they had stone ball i was like that's my child there you go that's my granddaughter read your bible amen let it mold character and of course my wife went to explaining why and all of that you know but he was like wow that's pretty strong but that's what she was reading in journeys off from perils of the water perils of rob or perils by my own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness hello how many knows one time he asked timmy timothy to bring his coat it's cold he was shivering maybe in jail he had the shiver sitting in a cold dark tail just shivering away cold yeah like you would see a dog out there somewhere shivering in the cold he had it rough besides those things that are within that which cometh upon dave me daily the cares of all the churches who is weak and i am not weak who is offended and i am not amen that falls in look if you got a reason to complain if you got a reason to not be thankful i've got more of a reason if i must need glory i will glory into things which concern my infirmities amen i didn't write this down but i just looked across the page there which is perfect look over into verse 9 of chapter 12. and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in mine infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches look how positive the holy ghost was in paul in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i strong amen let's go to second corinthians 4 7 to 9. 4 7-9 paul says this way but we have this treasure in earth and vessels now remember he said just over here a page further over i believe it was he said he said most gladly therefore will i rather glory and remind infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me he realized that when these things come that's when you have to have that peace in your heart you know right and the power of god will come forth i will take care of it so here he was once again saying we have this treasure in our earthly vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed amen amen something positive we are perplexed but we're not in despair we're persecuted but praise be to god hallelujah somebody say amen but we're not forsaken every time no matter how bad it was paul always had something good to say how many knows that's the holy ghost that's what the holy ghost will do doesn't matter how bad it is he'll always have something positive to say just like that woman talking about the adversary of the devil now let's go to philippians philippians 4. philippians 4 and verse 11. well let's go let's read verse 8 a little bit longer let's take a little further journey down this path of the word amen see what the lord will teach us verse 8 says finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue or if there be any praise think on these things notice how that one of them says be any praise i mean those you mean that praise is part of thanking being thankful amen verse 11 not that i speak in respect of one for i have earned in whatsoever state amen how many knows it's our state of being it's about the state that we're in the state that we live in every single day i have learned whatsoever state i am whether he's being beat whether he's being stoned whether he's going down in a ship all he thinks whether i'm cold whether i'm full or whether i'm hungry or whatever it is i'm still going to be thankful i'm still going to be thankful whatever state that i am there with to be content amen we realize that how many knows that can only you can only say that that when you're going through your hardest struggles and hardest battles your biggest adversity that comes against you because we all have adversity life is full of adversity you have to learn to deal with adversity in this world or you're definitely going to have road rage and everything else kind of rage you won't make it amen somebody will kill you or you'll kill somebody if you don't learn to learn to live with adversity things are not always going to go right and paul knew that more he sure didn't have everything going right but he learned whatever state is be content amen and i know how to be a based and i know how to abound everywhere in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry i know what it's like to be on the mountaintop i know what it's like to be in the valley and i've learned in it all so he's thankful content amen i can do all things through christ we could re-read it i can go through anything with christ amen how many wants to be in that place lord i can go through anything i can live in a place and be in a state of peace with god and it doesn't matter what comes and i truly believe that with paul it was all the way to putting his head on the block folks i'm here to tell you i don't know if we'll ever get it i don't want to see it but paul when they stuck his head up underneath that log i'm content let it fall whatever state i am in i'm content why because he was in heavenly places in christ jesus he was in the spirit so much that no matter what comes or what goes amen he was thankful in everything give thanks the bible said in james 1 i believe it says he says when he said counted all joy when you fall into diverse couches and ice cream parlors and good things happen to you no temptations and trials and everything else amen because that's when you really see god people don't want no adversity everybody wants to be a couch potato they don't want to work they don't want that they want everything easy they don't want no friction they don't want no body to disagree with them [Music] didn't even bring the bomb say he says what what would be like if nobody ever disagreed with us we'd be like a rag just you know that's what the world wants to be just a rag did everything handed to him to god at the best amen amen and yet they aren't thankful adversity how many knows god god puts it in our lives he brings adversity into our life to see how we will do how we will act and whether or not we will be content in everything god did it at the red sea isn't that right tomb come down there and they all boy they were thankful they were praising god when they came out of egypt all worshipping and praising god but when he brought him down there to the red sea they didn't they weren't so happy with their state of being anymore they weren't happy where they were folks and if you're relying on everything being in a good place for you to be happy then you're not always going to be happy huh you're going to come home your wife has had a bad day and she's going to be gripey and complaining and you maybe had a bad day you come home and you're all griping and complaining and everything else because things didn't go right today at all folks you're gonna have ups and downs like you wouldn't believe it's gonna be a rollercoaster ride because god made it that way he didn't make everything go good he made it things to go wrong huh he does it on purpose even the prophet god said he said the best thing that god can give us is a trial huh the thing that comes the best thing that can come along our way sometimes is for the wind to blow on those trees and just boy they're just bending over they're barely hanging on by the roots them roots are popping huh but guess what it's stretching it and then when it comes back up those roots will go deeper dig deeper and it'll take a bigger win next time to move that tree and that's what he does with us that's what he did with israel he wanted to see what they would do in the middle of adversity if they would be thankful in whatever state they are or if they would complain of the state that they're in most of us have to get old before we get to this place brother glenn before we learn hey don't let everything upset you that comes along try to let nothing upset you because that's exactly what it is here you are upright all of a sudden you're upset you're upside down you aren't what you are at all you know you're all out of whack who needs to get all out of whack and all upset huh no but listen so he did it there he did it with their how about when they got hungry right they were so he took them through that their dead end next thing was hunger they got hungry now what god was looking for was like paul whatever state that they were in to say well thank you lord i am not in egypt anymore i'll tell you what i ate a little better there because i didn't get hungry there that fed me good huh here i am hungry but guess what they're not taking our children for their slaves anymore at their will i'm not a slave anymore i don't have to do all that every day anymore praise be to god i may be alone praise god anyway that's what god was looking for huh but no they quickly became unthankful because they were not content with the state that they were in amen praise you know how many knows thankfulness is part of worshiping and praising god thank you thank you thank you lord for saving me worshiping god and praising him for what he for everybody has done israel one time when they were preaching of the word come forth amen and the people got the worshipping god so much and until the preacher couldn't even talk anymore it was too loud out there they were over writing the preacher and so they just went to worship see god inhabits the praise of his people god inhabits the praise of his people he don't inhabit when there's fussing and bickering and fighting and grouching and all god just man if you want poison assets you want to get the holy ghost to get out of the church just become a complainer just complain about one thing and poof there he goes that's right beyond thankful for one thing and poop he's gone he does god don't live in that he don't live in fusses or fights he don't live there he lives in contentment and brotherly kindness and love that's where it inhabits thankfulness he comes down there and oh my just what a what a beautiful thing when everybody is thankful to god the way they should do and begin the worshiping god god comes down and part of the reason we don't have as much as the holy spirit to come down is because we're not as thankful as what we should be we don't give god the praise that he deserves amen amen begin to oh my what it does when you're a thankful person it brings a song in your heart it brings a song in your heart it makes you appreciate it makes you love god more amen amen i got a couple more scriptures that all right whether believe it or not another 15 minutes amen let me see here this is a scripture i didn't even wrote down i just opened it up and read it be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god didn't even have this this is just coming to my scripture and listen to this how good it's perfectly and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through jesus christ if you want to know where that is that's the verse just before philippians 8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true and whatsoever things are good i didn't even see that there oh we could just go all night if you if i'd taken more time to find more of those scriptures we could go online like that but i think that's perfect talking about with everything all of your quests everything amen come with thanksgiving amen and then let the peace of god which passes understanding if you don't know that i mean here here and on the on the internet listen if you really don't know what that piece that passes understanding is that just completely satisfies you because so completely until you really don't need anything else but god you're just content with them is and take some time take some time i would say take however long whatever time you got to take out of your busy schedule until you find that peace because if you don't find that peace you will not find no contentment or satisfaction because there's only one side one place of contentment and that is a place of satisfaction and that is in peace amen okay first timothy 6 one that i've read many times but i think it's good to read and we'll begin with verse five first timothy six verse five perverse disputings of men of corrupt mind and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw yourself but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain that we will carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be content there with now how many knows that doesn't he's not talking about salvation i'm on salvation i want all of those things but he was talking naturally speaking here food in raiment you should be happy you should have a smile on your face that's right most of us need a big refrigerator how many needs a big refrigerator you can't get enough stuff in there it's too much stuff in there my wife orders two gallons of milk one of two gallons of low fat and another two gallons of one percent you know and then we have two half gallons of creamer for our and you know and you just i can't get this in the fridge i got plenty of food hello well i need her oh boy i hope she don't get me for this went in her closet the other day and i think mine looks about just the same and you got to squish them close together there's no more room for any more clothes come on folks amen it's all right isn't that what it is why we ought to be very content very happy very thankful thank you jesus why is it that we americans and christians can have so much and yet be so unhappy sad very sad i guarantee you one thing that if a bum i mean a street bomb in india found out that he was going to get to be dropped in america he would probably jump up and down the stream and i'm going to just i'm going to be a bum in america yeah i'm rich because brother bam says even a bum in america is rich he's going to be happy we have so much folks let's ask this how content how godly are we how much of the peace of god do we have amen god bless you stand with me tonight having food and raiment let us be content there with but they that will be rich amen you put god last because you just want more money huh you're in for trouble there will be rich fall into temptation and a snare just today i was listening or yesterday i believe it was brother branham i'd never heard him talk about he says people that want to get rich listen it only brings strife it brings differences it brings arguments he just went down the list of everything that does getting rich does he didn't have much good to say about it amen listen to what the bible says then it will be rich fell into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but thou o man of god see how much money more money you can make get more get more no he says oh man of god flee thee things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith behold on eternal life where unto thou art also called and has professed a great confession before many witnesses let's bow our heads with our heads bowed search your heart have we put more emphasis on the riches of this world than do we have with having peace with god in our hearts that even if we was to come to death we could say i am content with the state i'm with i am in god's care i'm so thankful that i have god in my heart or have we put too much emphasis on the things of this world it's become too important to us so just ask yourself the question tonight where are you what state are you in tonight are you in a state of contentment thankfulness positive not negative about whatever comes or whatever goes your personality the way that you are it's godly if not raise your hand say god i confess i'm not what i should be the lord jesus help me come to this place help me to come to this state of having perfect peace in my heart and to be thankful no matter what state i am i'm still thankful god bless your hands god bless you mind's up i need to be a whole lot more thankful than what i am lord jesus our hands are up we're guilty we're certainly not perfect but we ask god that is we have read your word and i truly believe that we have tried to give a correct view of how you see it and how you want us what you expect of us and what we need to be father i know i fall short and i ask audrey to forgive me along with every hand that has went up every heart and help us from this wednesday night on lord to find that place and make it more important to find that place lord jesus where we bask in your sunshine in your presence in your peace lord then anything else help us just to find more time and find that place that we can't have and do that more lord jesus i'm more guilty than anybody father but lord tonight we raise our hands to help us lord because we want to be in a place lord jesus that we're content not because of how much we have or what we have but we're content because we have you and that is everything that we'll ever have need of in this life's journey or in the world to come or in death we have what we have need we have what we need and we're content it doesn't matter what our natural world is what's important is where our spiritual world is where we are in our spirit with you is what's important and father i pray god that you would bring a peace in every heart said lord we could go home go to our jobs tomorrow with a smile on our face and lord these others could see that that is one contented person that person is happy that person is thankful that person is positive about everything never negative and i ask god that you'd help mold and shape this character in us as we look for you to come from the skies one of these days and change our bodies we ask it in jesus name amen and amen amen you know that course give thanks with a grateful heart my don and i can bring that up on the screen give thanks give
