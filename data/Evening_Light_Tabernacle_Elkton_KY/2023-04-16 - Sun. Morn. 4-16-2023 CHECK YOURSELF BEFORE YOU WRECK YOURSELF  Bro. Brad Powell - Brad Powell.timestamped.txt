[14:46] morning
[14:55] foreign
[14:58] foreign
[15:29] every day
[15:48] I'm going to look around
[15:51] here
[15:54] they shouldn't be doing for you whatever
[15:57] you think
[15:58] the Lord you show me how to fix it let's
[16:02] get on your knees and pray for the
[16:03] person
[16:04] or that's what Real Love Is
[16:06] Lord I pray this morning
[16:08] download
[16:10] another different points is going
[16:12] through this
[16:14] Jesus
[16:17] they have ever made in this morning
[16:19] or that we can open our hearts and our
[16:22] ears and our eyes
[16:24] for whatever we're having together Lord
[16:27] we lay here we will never be the same
[16:30] Lord I'm concerned to say
[16:32] I feel like I'm the most need
[16:35] the next one
[16:38] you want to see
[16:43] everything around us Lord the world has
[16:46] fallen apart it is not something of the
[16:49] future
[16:50] the Lord I pray that you have made one
[16:53] of us this morning
[16:55] thank you for the mercy of Grace that
[16:57] you've had committed
[17:00] foreign
[17:13] this morning
[17:16] with this place in the name of the Lord
[17:18] Jesus Christ amen
[17:21] amen children can be dismissed for
[17:23] Sunday School
[17:26] we're just going the Psalms here
[17:35] good prayer brother Joe it's all we
[17:38] needed yeah
[17:40] sure is easy to fix everybody else's
[17:42] problems but it's not really it's always
[17:44] easy to fix our own problems I can lose
[17:47] weight for everybody else and go on a
[17:49] diet and help them do that but it's hard
[17:51] to go on a diet yourself and do the same
[17:52] thing but
[17:54] it's easy to give advice but a lot
[17:56] harder to walk through the things that
[17:58] we have to go through sometimes
[18:00] uh Psalms one we're gonna go to Psalms
[18:03] one
[18:04] for our scripture reading just a real
[18:07] short Psalms
[18:17] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[18:20] the console of the ungodly nor standeth
[18:22] in the way of of Sinners nor siddeth in
[18:25] the seedeth scornful
[18:34] and he shall be like a tree that is
[18:36] planted by the rivers of water that
[18:39] bringeth forth his fruit
[18:41] in his season his Leaf also shall not
[18:44] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[18:47] prosper
[18:54] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[18:56] the Judgment nor sinners in the
[18:58] congregation of the righteous
[19:00] for the Lord knoweth the way of the
[19:02] righteous but the way of the ungodly
[19:04] Shall Perish God bless you may be seated
[19:12] we'll be doing some scripture reading a
[19:15] little bit of scripture reading here
[19:17] got a couple quotes here if I can get
[19:19] them all together here
[19:23] can't go wrong with reading the
[19:25] scriptures so sometimes that's what I
[19:28] got to try to stick with so
[19:31] let's see here if we'll go to uh
[19:34] you can go with me if you want to and if
[19:36] you don't have to if you don't want to
[19:37] but Zechariah
[19:39] 14.
[19:42] verse 6.
[19:44] and seven
[19:50] uh Zechariah 14 6 and 7 and it shall
[19:53] come to pass in that day that the light
[19:55] shall be that the light shall not be
[19:57] clear nor dark
[19:59] but it shall be
[20:02] one day which shall be known to the Lord
[20:04] not day nor night but it shall come to
[20:07] pass that that in the heat at the
[20:09] evening time there shall be light
[20:12] it showed me like
[20:15] and uh that's where I believe we are
[20:17] right now actually
[20:19] the Rems called into dismal Dave
[20:22] and uh
[20:23] this is from
[20:25] let's see here
[20:28] the great coming revival and outpouring
[20:30] of the Holy Ghost were the rims and then
[20:31] through this time did you ever see a day
[20:34] that was dark and drizzle in a
[20:36] dismal-like day
[20:38] that's the thing that we've lived
[20:39] through well they got enough light that
[20:42] they can see that Jesus was the Christ
[20:44] and they ought to accept and as Savior
[20:46] but all of his great powers and things
[20:48] have been hid from them they can't see
[20:51] it all through the day they said
[20:54] the days of Miracles has passed all them
[20:56] things they had on Pentecost that ceased
[20:59] and that's when the Sun was shining back
[21:00] there in the east
[21:02] but geographically
[21:04] and that's where we are today uh that's
[21:07] one of the things I was gonna uh
[21:09] but we should be so thankful
[21:12] that we do have eyes that can see in
[21:14] yours that can hear because
[21:16] most of the world and most of the
[21:18] denominational
[21:19] people they they can't see it you can
[21:22] you can show it to them right to their
[21:24] face you can take them back to the
[21:25] scriptures and show it to them over and
[21:27] over and over again and they'll get out
[21:29] of it this way and they'll get out of it
[21:31] that way they'll get out of it whichever
[21:33] way they can get out of it because they
[21:35] can't see it
[21:36] but thank you Lord for letting me be
[21:39] able to see what I can see and hear what
[21:41] I can hear because once you do see and
[21:44] hear you can't unsee it so once you do
[21:47] have a revelation of what God's done in
[21:50] this age
[21:51] and what he's doing in this age you
[21:53] cannot unsee it but just the same way
[21:57] unless God would open their eyes and
[21:59] open their ears they cannot see it
[22:02] but geographically speaking brother
[22:03] Brown says watch the sun is done crossed
[22:05] over now by human theology by Church
[22:09] organization by the nominations and so
[22:11] forth it's dark in these things from the
[22:14] Christian's eyes that's right it's dark
[22:16] and Divine Healing let's start in the
[22:18] power of God it's darkened all the gifts
[22:21] they've applied it back there where the
[22:23] Sun was shining
[22:24] here it is but the prophet said it shall
[22:26] be light in the evening time the sun
[22:28] rises in the East it sets in the west
[22:30] when we're the Western People Western
[22:32] Hemisphere
[22:34] here we're in the west the Western
[22:36] people as it Rose Over Yonder in the
[22:38] beginning and was showed that the same
[22:40] Holy Spirit the fell on the day of
[22:41] Pentecost and things that it accompanied
[22:44] in the church there the very things that
[22:45] happened back there in the uh in the
[22:48] last days in the last 20 or 30 years has
[22:50] felt here on the western world and
[22:52] showing the same signs here that it did
[22:53] over there it'll be light in the evening
[22:55] time he says the clouds broke back
[22:58] denominations are broke
[23:00] Hallelujah and the people has entered
[23:02] into the baptism of the holy spirit with
[23:04] signs and wonders just like they had in
[23:05] the beginning it'll be light in the
[23:07] evening time and remember it was the
[23:09] evening time when the bride was chosen
[23:12] Rebecca was taken in the evening time it
[23:14] was the evening time that she met Isaac
[23:17] he was out in the field
[23:19] it's the evening time our general
[23:21] Gentile Revival is coming is ending
[23:24] pretty soon the Jews are going to take
[23:26] the Revival as soon as they can see the
[23:29] power of God manifesting and receiving
[23:30] the Holy Ghost they'll take the gospel
[23:33] or Gentile days are ending get into the
[23:36] kingdom while you have a chance to get
[23:37] into the kingdom he says
[23:39] I'm gonna Revive on outpouring of the
[23:41] Holy Spirit and that's so true that's
[23:43] exactly
[23:45] where we're standing today like brother
[23:47] and brother Joe's prayer the world is
[23:49] crumbling
[23:50] and whoever's supposed to be in charge
[23:53] they're they're in on vacation or
[23:56] something they're they're not making
[23:58] good choices so the world is crumbling
[24:00] and it seems to be crumbling faster and
[24:02] decisions that people are supposed
[24:03] should be making they're making the
[24:06] opposite of those decisions so it's
[24:08] unraveling and it's unraveling fast
[24:10] uh
[24:12] I had some more scriptures here
[24:14] I was just uh
[24:16] listening to different things and
[24:20] um
[24:21] well let's go over here once
[24:25] let's go to Matthew
[24:28] let's go to Matthew 24.
[24:40] no
[24:42] Jesus is in here telling his disciples
[24:45] what it's what will kind of be like here
[24:49] foreign
[24:51] the fourth verse Maybe
[24:54] in Jesus answered and said unto them
[24:56] take heed that no man deceive you for
[24:58] many shall come in my name saying I am
[24:59] Christ and shall deceive many you should
[25:02] hear of wars and rumors of wars see that
[25:04] you be not troubled for all these things
[25:06] must come to pass the end this did not
[25:08] yet
[25:09] Nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom
[25:11] against Kingdom there shall be famines
[25:14] pestilence and earthquakes in diverse
[25:16] places all these things are the
[25:17] beginning of Sorrows
[25:19] then they shall deliver you up to be
[25:21] afflicted as you kill you they shall you
[25:24] should be hated of all Nations for our
[25:25] name's sake
[25:27] and then shall many have be offended and
[25:29] shall betray one another
[25:31] shall he and shall hit one another many
[25:34] false prophets shall rise they shall
[25:36] deceive many and because iniquity shall
[25:38] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[25:41] while iniquities abounding in the love
[25:43] of the love is definitely waxing cold in
[25:46] the world
[25:47] but he that shall endure unto the end
[25:49] the same shall be saved
[25:51] and this gospel
[25:53] of the Kingdom shall be preached in all
[25:55] the world for a witness unto all the
[25:57] nations
[25:59] and then shall the End come
[26:02] and uh yeah if you turn well you know I
[26:06] don't know but if you turn on your phone
[26:08] basically or any any device that
[26:11] um has the news on it
[26:13] there's killings every day
[26:16] murders every day so a lot of times mass
[26:19] shootings
[26:20] there's
[26:23] Wars or rumors of wars
[26:27] um
[26:28] I was listening uh to an interview
[26:32] and uh
[26:34] yeah the the systems that are in place
[26:36] we don't know how fast of unravel we
[26:38] don't quite know where we are and we do
[26:40] we can see say one thing we better be
[26:43] looking up because
[26:45] the world is coming apart at the seams
[26:49] nobody seems to have uh you know a clue
[26:53] of what to do about it
[26:55] but uh
[26:56] basically that's uh
[26:59] I was listening to this interview and
[27:01] they said uh the
[27:04] the bombs that were dropped in Nagasaki
[27:07] Japan
[27:08] they were
[27:10] they said the bombs that we have now
[27:13] the nuclear weapons and stuff they said
[27:16] times what was dropped in Nagasaki Japan
[27:18] which was so hot it melted granite and
[27:22] people are still having deformities from
[27:24] what was dropped back then
[27:26] at the end of the last World War and
[27:28] they said multiply that times 500 they
[27:30] said
[27:31] so once things start going bad which
[27:35] they are going heading that direction
[27:37] but
[27:38] basically it it wouldn't take long for
[27:41] the destruction on the whole world
[27:44] and uh
[27:46] as Brother David oftentimes sings
[27:50] all our hope and all our hope should be
[27:52] in Jesus
[27:55] we know
[27:56] we don't have
[27:58] we get kind of well we do get distracted
[28:00] I know I get distracted with things we
[28:02] got things that we have to do we always
[28:04] got so many obligations it seems like
[28:07] keeps us so busy
[28:09] but I guess uh you know the main focus
[28:12] and what we should be focusing on
[28:13] especially because I believe it is
[28:15] winding down time is Jesus beginning
[28:18] getting ourselves ready to leave this
[28:20] world which has nothing left
[28:23] for us
[28:24] but uh getting ourselves ready to leave
[28:27] this world
[28:28] and what did Jesus say in there he said
[28:30] I believe you sit in there as you see
[28:32] these things approaching look up for
[28:34] your Redemption draweth nigh
[28:37] and that's all we want to do that's what
[28:39] we're that's what we come into the house
[28:41] of the Lord this morning to do to listen
[28:42] to the word to search ourselves
[28:46] and I know
[28:47] I know we make mistakes I know the Devil
[28:49] beats us up over these you know
[28:51] different things that we make mistakes
[28:53] over but the one thing that we got to do
[28:56] is if we get knocked down if we get
[28:58] kicked while we're down just roll over
[29:00] and do your best get back up you might
[29:03] have to crawl for a while but whatever
[29:04] you have to do keep going in the right
[29:06] direction
[29:07] the devil
[29:10] is going around like a roaring lion
[29:12] seeking whom he may destroy and uh we
[29:15] don't want to be left on the outside of
[29:16] that arc when when the rain starts
[29:18] raining so we want to get ourselves
[29:20] ready
[29:21] we want to be ready so uh that's pretty
[29:24] much all I got this morning brother
[29:26] David
[29:30] all your heart this morning
[29:36] I thought
[29:37] that as he mentioned that little course
[29:39] that we sang so many times oh my hope is
[29:43] in Jesus
[29:44] I thought you know Lord
[29:46] where could I go this morning
[29:49] where could we go
[29:51] [Music]
[29:54] I don't know
[29:56] but I'm so glad this morning
[29:57] [Music]

[37:26] just give him some very powerful
[37:28] powerful services and he said they'd had
[37:32] 30 come to the Lord and thought my what

[54:04] we certainly serve a mighty God this
[54:06] morning and thankful to be in the house
[54:08] of the Lord and we if you want to grab
[54:10] your Bibles
[54:12] we will get right into the word here in
[54:15] just a second
[54:20] I guess uh I need to put out a little
[54:22] disclaimer
[54:24] uh brother Biola preached on being
[54:26] content on the last service we had and
[54:29] and uh all
[54:33] a week or so two weeks I've been
[54:35] preaching I'm not being content or
[54:37] thinking I'm preaching on not being
[54:38] content so I'm not here to contradict
[54:41] what he said or what he's what he was
[54:43] going and I hope you understand the
[54:45] difference in the two contexts of where
[54:47] he was at and where I'm going uh
[54:50] but uh I think if we could open our
[54:54] hearts this morning and and just receive
[54:56] what God would have in store for us I
[54:58] think God wants wants us a little closer
[55:00] this morning and I think God wants us to
[55:02] live a little closer to him this morning
[55:04] you know we love the encouraging
[55:05] messages and man do I love to preach him
[55:07] I love to preach inspiration
[55:09] encouragement and trying to lift others
[55:10] up and I love to see people succeed and
[55:13] be successful but you know when it all
[55:15] boils down to it if we're not successful
[55:17] at the end if our lives are not lining
[55:20] up with where the word is
[55:23] we've it's all it's all vanity
[55:26] so we have to be able to line up to the
[55:28] word in order to be truly successful at
[55:31] the end of our road
[55:33] and that's where I want to be
[55:35] so when I preach today I'm preaching to
[55:37] you I'm preaching to my to myself
[55:40] I'm preaching to my wife I'm preaching
[55:42] to my children to everyone I want us to
[55:44] be ready
[55:45] and if I put a title on this this
[55:47] morning I'm going to title this check
[55:49] yourself before you wreck yourself
[55:53] we'll turn to Isaiah chapter 6.
[56:00] very one of my favorite scriptures but
[56:02] I've I don't think I've ever ever
[56:04] preached on this
[56:07] um but I love I love this scripture here
[56:10] Isaiah chapter 6.
[56:15] say Amen when you get there
[56:18] okay
[56:22] in the year this is Isaiah speaking here
[56:25] in the year that King Uzziah died I saw
[56:28] also the Lord sitting up on the throne
[56:30] high and lift
[56:32] Ed up and his Trump the seraphim
[56:36] s
[56:38] foreign
[56:41] I'm kind of I've always had an
[56:43] intriguement I guess angels and and you
[56:45] know you see different things and I kind
[56:47] of chuckle and it just so the response
[56:49] of some people and I don't mean to say
[56:51] this lightly but some people I think
[56:53] understand exactly what they're looking
[56:55] for and angels and cherubims and
[56:57] seraphims and you know you see people
[56:59] that uh you'll see it on car windows and
[57:01] so and so passed away and they received
[57:03] their wings and that's not the way it
[57:05] works with you're either a human or
[57:07] you're an angel you don't receive Wings
[57:09] when you die and go on
[57:11] cemetery is a lot you see the little
[57:14] chubby face
[57:15] baby-faced angel with wings
[57:19] that's far from what a true chariable
[57:22] Miss and the seraphim and when you read
[57:25] this you see and I think this tells us
[57:27] in this next scripture it tells us the
[57:30] magnificence of of what what uh Isaiah
[57:34] sees in this vision and if you think
[57:36] about every time in the Bible that an
[57:38] angel step forward or appeared or showed
[57:40] himself and I think even when uh brother
[57:42] Billy Paul was seeing the angel
[57:47] they were warned don't be afraid
[57:50] don't be afraid so there's a
[57:52] magnificence about these angels and
[57:54] these seraphims and these cherubims that
[57:56] are Divine beings if you have to be told
[57:59] don't be afraid
[58:00] okay so let's go on with our text here
[58:03] and each one had six wings with Twain he
[58:06] covered his face with Swain he covered
[58:08] his feet with Twain he did fly and one
[58:12] cry to another and said holy holy holy
[58:16] is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is
[58:20] full of his glory
[58:23] Watch What Happens and the post of the
[58:26] door moved at the voice the very
[58:29] doorpost shook when these voices were
[58:33] crying out holy holy holy as Isaiah sees
[58:36] it in the scripture or in the vision
[58:37] here and they moved at the voice of him
[58:40] that cried and the house was filled with
[58:42] smoke watch what happens to Isaiah then
[58:45] said I woe is me
[58:48] for I am undone because I am a man of
[58:51] unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of
[58:53] people of unclean lips for my eyes have
[58:55] seen the king the Lord of hosts then
[58:58] flew one of the seraphims unto me having
[59:01] a live coal in his hand which he had
[59:03] taken with the tongs from off the Altar
[59:06] and he laid it up on my mouth and said
[59:09] Lo
[59:10] this has touched the this has touched
[59:13] thy lips and thine iniquity is taken
[59:17] away
[59:18] thy sins
[59:20] are purged
[59:22] wow
[59:24] how many can say this morning I I could
[59:26] use an angel of God to come down and
[59:28] touch my lips what was me I could use an
[59:31] angel to come down and touch my lips
[59:33] with a hot coal of fire to burn out
[59:36] anything in my life that's contrary to
[59:38] the word of God
[59:39] amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father
[59:42] we just want to tell you this morning we
[59:44] love you we appreciate you Lord
[59:47] Lord I just come before you personally
[59:49] asking that I might decrease that you
[59:51] would increase that the words that will
[59:53] be spoken today would
[59:55] reach down and prick our hearts as you
[59:58] go through the congregation weaving
[1:00:00] through the congregation Lord this is
[1:00:02] not the kind of services that we that we
[1:00:05] uh
[1:00:06] pull forward that we ask that we ask for
[1:00:09] Lord but it's the kind of services that
[1:00:12] we need to make sure we're ready and
[1:00:13] Lord I put myself at the Forefront if
[1:00:15] there's anything in my life that's
[1:00:16] contrary if there's anything that's
[1:00:18] holding me back from being what you
[1:00:20] would have me to be Lord I I pray that
[1:00:22] you come down and burn it out with the
[1:00:23] fire of God that would cleanse my lips
[1:00:26] cleanse My Life Cleanse my home and my
[1:00:29] job my work whatever it would be that I
[1:00:31] could be pleasing to you because I see
[1:00:33] the importance of being ready everything
[1:00:35] else is just temporary but being ready
[1:00:38] and being in the word being what you
[1:00:40] would have us to be is eternal Lord
[1:00:42] Jesus help us this morning in Jesus name
[1:00:45] we pray amen you can have your seats
[1:00:47] this morning
[1:00:50] this is okay if I take my time
[1:00:54] well you gave me permission
[1:00:57] so here we go
[1:00:58] brother random says uh you can hear the
[1:01:01] word of God and then sit still friends
[1:01:04] how can you hear the word of God and sit
[1:01:07] still friends don't you see that science
[1:01:10] says about five years ago that it's
[1:01:12] three minutes till midnight he said do
[1:01:15] you know what God did
[1:01:16] he said because it's past time and he
[1:01:19] said do you know what God did he said he
[1:01:22] reached out with his hand and stopped
[1:01:26] God stopped time
[1:01:28] he said he reached out with his hand and
[1:01:30] stopped it with his hand for the church
[1:01:33] to make herself ready
[1:01:37] God thought enough about you and I our
[1:01:40] families our children that he would say
[1:01:42] this is getting too close to the end
[1:01:44] I've got everybody ready and everybody
[1:01:46] in I'm stopping time to allow my people
[1:01:51] time to prepare
[1:01:54] he stopped time he said there's a few
[1:01:56] more yet to come into the body of Christ
[1:01:58] maybe some of them was here today he
[1:01:59] said that's why I'm here to persuade you
[1:02:02] and this morning if I could persuade you
[1:02:05] and myself my family that it's a late
[1:02:08] hour and he says I'm not here to
[1:02:10] persuade you that don't be Catholic
[1:02:12] don't be Methodist or you can throw any
[1:02:14] denomination and you can throw a message
[1:02:16] in there
[1:02:17] he's not here to persuade you to be
[1:02:19] don't be those things he said I'm not
[1:02:21] saying it's what you belong to you can
[1:02:23] belong to all of them you can belong to
[1:02:25] none of them but what I want is for you
[1:02:28] to be filled with his spirit
[1:02:31] if we can find ourselves filled with
[1:02:33] God's spirit it doesn't matter what you
[1:02:36] claim to be where you claim to go who
[1:02:38] your pastor is but it matters what if
[1:02:41] you're filled with God's holy spirit and
[1:02:44] he says remember on that day I'll meet
[1:02:48] you on that day
[1:02:50] you've heard it
[1:02:52] he says I will meet you on that day he
[1:02:56] says and these words will be a witness
[1:02:58] against you
[1:03:00] he said go on God's tape recording and
[1:03:04] this great picture camera of Heaven
[1:03:09] listen to this
[1:03:10] and you're sitting and walking away and
[1:03:14] leaving it
[1:03:19] now
[1:03:20] when I said that somebody went through
[1:03:23] your mind
[1:03:25] let's not worry about somebody
[1:03:28] because I will tell you this
[1:03:31] if we're not careful we begin to
[1:03:33] progress
[1:03:35] into worldliness
[1:03:37] step by step instead of staying with
[1:03:40] what the message said
[1:03:42] I'm guilty you're guilty we're all
[1:03:46] guilty
[1:03:51] you'll see your own self at that day in
[1:03:55] the mirror of God
[1:03:57] so I say check ourselves before we wreck
[1:04:00] ourselves we look into the word of God
[1:04:03] and we want to make
[1:04:06] sure that we're doing what God would
[1:04:08] have us to do that we're living the life
[1:04:09] God would have us to live in 1988
[1:04:13] brother Butler used Kenny Rogers I'll
[1:04:15] use Michael Jackson
[1:04:17] 1988 Michael Jackson sang a song and
[1:04:20] debuted a song and went to the top of
[1:04:21] the pop charts and it's titled Man in
[1:04:24] the Mirror
[1:04:26] and this song it talks about changing
[1:04:28] the world and the entire theme of that
[1:04:31] song it says if you're ever going to
[1:04:32] make a change in this world and make it
[1:04:35] a better place you have to first start
[1:04:36] looking at yourself you have to start
[1:04:39] looking at the man in the mirror and
[1:04:41] that's what he said he said I'm starting
[1:04:43] with the man in the mirror he said I'm
[1:04:46] asking him to change his ways
[1:04:50] why would I worry about somebody else
[1:04:52] when I'm not even right yeah
[1:04:55] Emmy Michael listen I want you to listen
[1:04:57] to the next verse and this lyric a lyric
[1:05:00] in this verse and it repeats itself over
[1:05:02] and over and says no message could have
[1:05:05] been any clearer
[1:05:09] this is Michael Jackson
[1:05:12] what could we say no message has been
[1:05:16] any clearer
[1:05:18] and his song He's
[1:05:20] there's no message could have been any
[1:05:22] clearer if you want to make the world a
[1:05:24] better place take a look at yourself and
[1:05:25] make that
[1:05:27] change
[1:05:28] and we have been given a message of the
[1:05:30] hour we've been giving it a message of
[1:05:32] an hour that I find very ironic that
[1:05:34] that song would even say that and top
[1:05:36] the pop charts and become one of the
[1:05:39] most recognized iconic songs to this day
[1:05:41] saying over and over and we have been
[1:05:45] given a message that is absolutely
[1:05:46] there's nothing clearer that's ever been
[1:05:49] said
[1:05:51] brothers and sisters I tell you this
[1:05:52] morning that clear message of this hour
[1:05:54] is clear-cut
[1:05:56] that message of this hour is clear-cut
[1:05:59] to make our way a better place to make
[1:06:01] our world a better place to make your
[1:06:03] home a better place to make your
[1:06:06] marriage a better marriage to make your
[1:06:09] life your children's life your
[1:06:12] neighbor's life
[1:06:14] the place that you work look in the
[1:06:17] mirror
[1:06:18] but many times the problem is we just
[1:06:20] don't take time to look and examine
[1:06:22] ourselves
[1:06:24] we don't stop to truly look at ourselves
[1:06:26] and then when we do we don't make that
[1:06:28] change
[1:06:31] you know we have we don't take time to
[1:06:33] review Our Lives against the standard
[1:06:38] by which we should be living
[1:06:41] and honestly say I need to make a change
[1:06:47] you say well
[1:06:49] I think I'm doing all right that's not
[1:06:51] what the word says it says You Must Die
[1:06:52] daily
[1:06:53] it says we must die daily that is taking
[1:06:55] an examination of yourself and seeing
[1:06:58] where you're falling short and honestly
[1:07:00] looking and say God I need change
[1:07:03] I need to come to the Altar and I need
[1:07:06] to lay down this this hindering me in my
[1:07:09] life this or this
[1:07:11] others
[1:07:14] are you a stepping stone or a stumbling
[1:07:16] block
[1:07:17] yes
[1:07:21] here we would have to put the employees
[1:07:25] in it was my job and we had to do staff
[1:07:28] performances evaluations
[1:07:31] hated them
[1:07:32] I hated doing
[1:07:35] and I would pull the staff in and set
[1:07:37] them down in front of me and we begin to
[1:07:39] talk and we would discuss and I would
[1:07:41] say well how do you think you've done in
[1:07:43] the last year
[1:07:47] 99.9 percent of the time the responses I
[1:07:51] get were all positive
[1:07:54] oh I'm a team player
[1:07:56] I'm never late I don't make errors
[1:08:02] you know I get along with everybody I
[1:08:04] love my residence
[1:08:08] over and over I'm a positive all
[1:08:09] positive over and over and over all
[1:08:11] positive you know it's real easy to look
[1:08:14] at ourselves and see success
[1:08:17] it's real easy to look at ourselves and
[1:08:19] say I'm successful compared to
[1:08:22] so and so
[1:08:24] my family is prospering compared to so
[1:08:28] and so
[1:08:29] but what do you do when you look and you
[1:08:31] say how successful am I when I look at
[1:08:34] the handbook
[1:08:36] because that's what I would do when I
[1:08:38] would sit down
[1:08:39] with this and I would say you know
[1:08:40] you're exactly right you're never you're
[1:08:42] hardly ever late you got perfect
[1:08:44] attendance you're this this and this but
[1:08:46] what about when I look at the handbook
[1:08:47] and you're not lining up with a handbook
[1:08:49] and the of the company handbook
[1:08:52] with this policy you're not lining up
[1:08:54] with the company handbook with this
[1:08:56] policy and then they get a little
[1:08:58] defensive you know they don't like
[1:08:59] nobody likes to be told what you're
[1:09:01] doing wrong
[1:09:03] but as Christians and Believers we need
[1:09:05] somebody that will stand up here and
[1:09:07] tell us where we're falling short step
[1:09:10] on our toes kick us in the backside and
[1:09:13] say get with the program
[1:09:17] and the preachers do that because they
[1:09:19] care because they love you
[1:09:24] easy to see good qualities
[1:09:27] and many times as Christians I believe
[1:09:29] we come complacent and content with our
[1:09:32] lives
[1:09:33] and it's because God has been so good to
[1:09:36] us
[1:09:38] we can't deny that nobody in here can
[1:09:40] deny that God has been so good to you
[1:09:43] you prosper as as business people you
[1:09:46] prosper in your careers your families
[1:09:48] are prospering your children are
[1:09:50] prospering
[1:09:52] life is good
[1:09:55] and it's so because of that it's so
[1:09:57] often times we find ourselves we fail to
[1:10:00] realize that God is still wanting a
[1:10:03] Christian to be thankful for these
[1:10:05] prosperities
[1:10:11] and we go through life
[1:10:14] at this point in our life we go through
[1:10:16] life and somebody comes up a preacher
[1:10:18] evangelist Pastor whoever
[1:10:22] yes maybe it's just a lay member maybe
[1:10:25] it's your neighbor again and think well
[1:10:28] maybe maybe I'm not just right here but
[1:10:29] then we just only pay attention
[1:10:31] attention to it
[1:10:33] and those words begin to fall on deaf
[1:10:36] ears
[1:10:38] because we're prospering life is good
[1:10:41] things are going as you planned them man
[1:10:44] we're rolling
[1:10:46] and all of a sudden everything that you
[1:10:48] hear doesn't apply to you
[1:10:54] it doesn't apply to you anymore because
[1:10:56] you you don't you don't even have to go
[1:10:58] you don't even have to pray God just
[1:10:59] gives gives gives gives
[1:11:03] and you find yourself down there
[1:11:05] sometimes and you begin to wander and
[1:11:07] and wonder is words falling on deaf ears
[1:11:11] you know Jeremiah in the Bible there it
[1:11:13] talks about in Jeremiah and God comes
[1:11:16] down and talks to Jeremiah
[1:11:18] says you know Jeremiah I'm going to give
[1:11:19] you a word of mine
[1:11:22] to share with my people I'm going to
[1:11:25] give you a word and I want you to go out
[1:11:27] and speak and I want you to do all that
[1:11:29] now keep in mind Jeremiah's about 15
[1:11:30] years old when God comes to him and
[1:11:32] tells him this and Jeremiah then
[1:11:34] responds back to the back to God and
[1:11:36] says listen I'm too young for this God I
[1:11:39] can't take your word I'm not polished
[1:11:41] I'm not seasoned I'm too young I can't
[1:11:43] do this
[1:11:45] and God says
[1:11:48] I'll help you and what did God say he
[1:11:50] was going to do if you if you study your
[1:11:52] Bible and you look back in there and you
[1:11:53] read on it he says God said he touched
[1:11:56] his lips
[1:11:58] God come down and touched his lips and
[1:12:00] told Jeremiah Jeremiah don't worry I'm
[1:12:02] going to put the words into your mouth
[1:12:03] I'm gonna tell you what to say and I
[1:12:06] want you to do it no matter what and I
[1:12:08] will protect you
[1:12:10] and God warned him when you speak these
[1:12:12] words they're coming for your life
[1:12:16] now how would you like that
[1:12:17] responsibility
[1:12:19] and Jeremiah here God comes down to him
[1:12:22] and tells him all right it's time we're
[1:12:24] fast forward 15 years he's about 30
[1:12:26] years old now and God says it's time for
[1:12:29] you to speak the words that are placed
[1:12:31] in your heart and on your lips and
[1:12:34] Jeremiah begins to call the tribes from
[1:12:36] the north all these people that God is
[1:12:38] telling him are wicked and all the
[1:12:40] people that are forsaken him and it says
[1:12:42] that he God told him he said Jeremiah
[1:12:44] they're burning incense to their gods
[1:12:50] idols
[1:12:53] Idols in their lives
[1:12:56] so I asked us this morning is there
[1:12:59] anything in our lives
[1:13:01] that we cherish and we put forward and
[1:13:04] we and we nurture and we and we pull
[1:13:06] close to us and we put above God
[1:13:10] because that's exactly what these people
[1:13:12] were doing that Jeremiah was going to
[1:13:14] speak to
[1:13:15] they had idols and he says they're
[1:13:18] they're worshiping The Works of their
[1:13:20] own hands
[1:13:23] so these people are worshiping idols and
[1:13:26] they're worshiping and and the prophets
[1:13:29] of their own hands their businesses are
[1:13:31] flourishing
[1:13:33] you say well we got to be careful
[1:13:35] we got to be real careful here and then
[1:13:38] he looks there and he tells Jeremiah to
[1:13:39] stand strong say to him everything that
[1:13:42] I command you
[1:13:43] and Jeremiah tells them change your ways
[1:13:47] change what you're doing don't follow
[1:13:50] deceptive words follow the word of God
[1:13:53] don't find yourself listed
[1:13:56] to men outside of the of the message and
[1:13:59] taking leadership and guidance
[1:14:01] stay right with the word stay with the
[1:14:03] word stay with the word
[1:14:05] and Jeremiah's preaching this and as it
[1:14:08] goes forward he comes back and these
[1:14:11] people are sitting there and they look
[1:14:12] at him and they look at him and they say
[1:14:14] even though God commanded you these
[1:14:16] words
[1:14:18] you know where he was preaching at
[1:14:21] you know where these words were spoken
[1:14:23] at
[1:14:25] the Bible tells you they were in the
[1:14:27] house of the Lord
[1:14:30] these people all gathered
[1:14:33] in the house of the Lord
[1:14:37] these wasn't heathens
[1:14:41] they gathered in the house of the Lord
[1:14:43] and Jeremiah speaking and commanding
[1:14:46] these people to do what God had told
[1:14:47] them to do and they look at him and they
[1:14:50] say you shall die
[1:14:53] don't tell us what to do
[1:14:58] you see how the mindset can change so
[1:15:00] quickly
[1:15:02] foreign
[1:15:03] don't tell us what to do we are
[1:15:06] successful
[1:15:08] we don't have to follow the rules
[1:15:10] anymore
[1:15:11] they don't apply to us anymore
[1:15:15] and said God come down there and God
[1:15:17] begin to talk and God says don't worry
[1:15:21] Jeremiah I told you I'd protect you I'm
[1:15:24] going to take care of you and that's
[1:15:25] exactly what he did but these people
[1:15:28] brothers and sisters they did not see
[1:15:29] themselves anymore in God's message
[1:15:37] let that sink in for a minute
[1:15:40] they were around it they knew it they
[1:15:43] heard it they knew the message they knew
[1:15:45] the messenger
[1:15:46] but they could not see themselves and
[1:15:49] because they couldn't see themselves
[1:15:50] they began to rationalize everything
[1:15:52] away and then the gross the ugly the
[1:15:55] self-destructive the abomination of life
[1:15:58] that they were living towards God they
[1:16:00] didn't even recognize it couldn't even
[1:16:02] see it because of the good things that
[1:16:04] were going on and brothers and sisters
[1:16:06] we have to be even be very careful in
[1:16:08] this hour of plenty
[1:16:11] that we live in that we don't fall into
[1:16:13] that same trap and rationalize the
[1:16:16] message away
[1:16:18] if it was the message in 1940 1960 it's
[1:16:22] the message today
[1:16:24] it didn't change
[1:16:27] it doesn't change because we're getting
[1:16:28] older we change but the word doesn't
[1:16:31] change
[1:16:35] sometimes we begin to just think we're
[1:16:37] just okay to live any other way we want
[1:16:39] to because we're surrounded
[1:16:40] by the word
[1:16:43] I've been around this a long time you
[1:16:45] know
[1:16:46] there's people been arrested since uh
[1:16:48] they're still people probably living
[1:16:49] that was here when when brother Brown
[1:16:51] was here
[1:16:55] does that give you security
[1:16:57] just because you're around it
[1:16:59] no you have to be in it and it in you
[1:17:03] so when we begin to put the word on the
[1:17:05] outside and Surround ourselves with it
[1:17:08] and not be a participator of it we
[1:17:10] hinder ourselves and we hold ourselves
[1:17:12] back from begin being and becoming what
[1:17:15] God would have us to be
[1:17:20] let me tell you let me tell you like
[1:17:22] this
[1:17:24] your true identity
[1:17:26] your true God called identity can be
[1:17:29] lost just that quick
[1:17:31] it can be lost that quick if we're not
[1:17:34] careful the bride no longer looks like
[1:17:36] the bride
[1:17:38] the bride no longer talks like the bride
[1:17:42] the bride no longer identifies herself
[1:17:45] as the bride she no longer Walks Like
[1:17:49] the dry bride dresses like the bride
[1:17:51] talks like the bride
[1:17:54] the bride finds himself going places she
[1:17:57] used to wouldn't go
[1:17:58] the bride finds herself saying things
[1:18:01] she used to wouldn't say the bride finds
[1:18:04] herself listening to things that she
[1:18:05] used to wouldn't listen to do you see
[1:18:07] what I'm talking about
[1:18:10] God trick our hearts
[1:18:12] trick our hearts this morning that we
[1:18:14] don't find ourselves in this rut of life
[1:18:16] around the message that we're surrounded
[1:18:18] by the message but we have no part of it
[1:18:22] because that is very deceptive and
[1:18:25] that's where Satan wants you he wants
[1:18:26] those scales over your eyes where you
[1:18:29] can't even see your own faults you can't
[1:18:31] even see your own failures you can't see
[1:18:33] your own shortcomings
[1:18:34] because you're comparing yourself to
[1:18:37] brother so and so
[1:18:39] sister so and so that family
[1:18:43] hmm
[1:18:48] yeah we find ourselves doing those
[1:18:51] things we shouldn't do
[1:18:53] and then here on Sunday morning it's
[1:18:55] Hallelujah Mass shout glory god
[1:19:01] we don't like to change our ways
[1:19:05] we don't like to change our ways
[1:19:11] you know why we don't like change our
[1:19:13] ways
[1:19:14] because we get full of ourselves
[1:19:17] and when you're full of yourself when
[1:19:19] I'm
[1:19:20] full of myself
[1:19:22] there's no room for the feeling of the
[1:19:25] Holy Ghost
[1:19:27] what I need is to decrease
[1:19:30] so that he might increase
[1:19:32] and I need to allow God to come into my
[1:19:34] life and kick Pride out because pride is
[1:19:38] the what begins to creep into our lives
[1:19:40] and says I'm too good I I have too much
[1:19:43] pride to come to the altar anymore
[1:19:47] are we too good for altar calls
[1:19:49] are we are we beyond altar calls and all
[1:19:53] we want is to be lifted up and placed
[1:19:55] into heaven and it don't matter how we
[1:19:57] get there
[1:19:58] no that won't work that won't work we
[1:20:01] have to be able to Die daily and find
[1:20:03] ourselves at an altar of repentance and
[1:20:06] find ourselves repenting before our
[1:20:08] peers and making a public example and
[1:20:10] say God forgive me where I failed you
[1:20:12] I've got this in my life I need it out I
[1:20:15] want to get it out so that I can go
[1:20:16] forward so that I can be an example
[1:20:20] brothers and sisters we need a humble
[1:20:23] repentance
[1:20:25] a humble repentance that will change our
[1:20:27] ways to change our actions
[1:20:30] we don't want the word falling on deaf
[1:20:32] ears
[1:20:34] deaf ears are your biggest enemy
[1:20:38] brother Brennan preached a message he
[1:20:40] used Isaiah 6.
[1:20:45] he preached a message influence
[1:20:48] listen to this closely
[1:20:52] he said you know there are so many of us
[1:20:56] and most all of us influence Somebody by
[1:21:00] the things we do the way we live and the
[1:21:04] things we say
[1:21:08] brothers and sisters
[1:21:10] when we realize that we're the most
[1:21:12] powerful influencers that the world will
[1:21:16] ever know
[1:21:17] The Living World it'll change our whole
[1:21:20] perspective on what we should be doing
[1:21:23] I'm not talking about being an
[1:21:24] influencer like on Facebook or Tick Tock
[1:21:27] one of these celebrity influencers that
[1:21:29] are trying to get you to do this or do
[1:21:31] that or do this I'm talking about the
[1:21:33] kind of influencer that encourages
[1:21:34] people and leads people to the kingdom
[1:21:37] of God that's the kind of influencer I
[1:21:40] want to be listen to this he says we
[1:21:43] influence somebody somebody is watching
[1:21:46] your life
[1:21:48] and then when we profess to be
[1:21:50] Christians what type of life should we
[1:21:52] live if somebody is watching us
[1:21:55] and your life that you live will reflect
[1:21:57] an influence on somebody
[1:22:00] this next statement caught my attention
[1:22:01] probably as great as any I've ever read
[1:22:05] he said there
[1:22:09] t-h-e-i-r there
[1:22:12] Eternal destination
[1:22:15] will rest upon the way that you live and
[1:22:19] the things that you do for they watch
[1:22:22] you
[1:22:27] when we come to a place brothers and
[1:22:29] sisters that we hear that and we
[1:22:31] understand and we realize that it is a
[1:22:33] responsibility that God has placed on us
[1:22:36] with that one little statement right
[1:22:37] there that their Eternal destination
[1:22:39] will rest upon you
[1:22:44] that is a responsibility that is greater
[1:22:46] than anything that I know that I could
[1:22:48] do on the face of the Earth
[1:22:50] is it when people watch me when they
[1:22:52] hear me when they when they see how I
[1:22:53] react when they when they see what we do
[1:22:55] as Christians because people want to
[1:22:57] know what does God and shoe leather do
[1:22:59] in 2023
[1:23:02] what does this good and shoe letters
[1:23:04] speak in 2023
[1:23:08] I will tell you this it's not
[1:23:10] homosexuality
[1:23:12] it's not transgender
[1:23:15] let me tell you you know it's bad and
[1:23:17] this just come to me
[1:23:19] it's bad
[1:23:22] when the beer drinkers
[1:23:25] boycott
[1:23:27] transgenders
[1:23:29] do you realize Anheuser-Busch because
[1:23:32] they promoted a transgender
[1:23:36] lost over four billion dollars in sales
[1:23:42] that's bad when the beer drinkers are
[1:23:44] taking a stand
[1:23:46] we're living in a wicked wicked world
[1:23:50] but to know that the life that I live
[1:23:53] and somebody watching me
[1:23:56] could help them make it to that Eternal
[1:23:58] destination
[1:24:02] do you see the importance of this
[1:24:04] morning as we examine ourselves and we
[1:24:06] look in the mirror and we say am I
[1:24:08] lining up with the message of the hour
[1:24:09] am I living according to the standard to
[1:24:12] God's handbook
[1:24:16] not what I think's right
[1:24:19] you know I've got a lot of opinions most
[1:24:21] of them's not right
[1:24:23] so I can't live my life and say well I
[1:24:25] think God would approve of this
[1:24:28] or brother so-and-so said that God would
[1:24:31] probably be okay if I do this or if the
[1:24:34] women do this or if the ladies do this
[1:24:36] that's not what we go by
[1:24:40] if he brother so-and-so is not pulling
[1:24:43] it right out of here brother so-and-so
[1:24:45] has got his own ideas involved
[1:24:48] so we have to be careful when we do that
[1:24:51] because we have no choice but to measure
[1:24:54] up to God's word and if we're not where
[1:24:56] we need to be change has to happen
[1:25:00] he said in our text this morning we find
[1:25:02] an influence that this King Uzziah
[1:25:05] he said he was a great influence to
[1:25:07] Isaiah he said it was a young prophet
[1:25:10] Isaiah had been called to his side and
[1:25:12] and Vindicated the prophet of his day
[1:25:14] and now we find the Uzziah was called to
[1:25:17] be king at the age of about 17 16 years
[1:25:21] old and he said after his father's death
[1:25:23] his father was a great believer
[1:25:26] talking about Uzziah now his father was
[1:25:29] a great believer his mother was also a
[1:25:31] very fine woman and this young king had
[1:25:35] been crowned at a young age and quickly
[1:25:37] had taken the road that was right
[1:25:39] because of the influence of a Godly
[1:25:41] father and a Godly mother
[1:25:43] parents
[1:25:45] your responsibility my responsibility as
[1:25:48] parents is to set an example before our
[1:25:51] children that we will live our best
[1:25:56] at home
[1:25:57] because the prophet said you will live
[1:25:59] your best and you will live your worst
[1:26:03] at home
[1:26:05] why is that
[1:26:07] it's because we're comfortable
[1:26:10] nobody's there
[1:26:12] we're in the Comforts of our own living
[1:26:14] room
[1:26:15] nobody from the outsides looking in the
[1:26:18] shades are pulled
[1:26:20] the only people there is you and your
[1:26:22] children
[1:26:24] so it's our responsibility to live a
[1:26:28] life that'll be an example to our
[1:26:29] children he said though the children
[1:26:31] might not just act exactly
[1:26:34] they're noticing
[1:26:37] they're noticing
[1:26:39] he said you think that they're not
[1:26:43] but I'm afraid to tell you they're
[1:26:45] watching
[1:26:48] you watch these little babies around
[1:26:50] here
[1:26:51] you watch them
[1:26:53] they're going to do what they've seen to
[1:26:55] do
[1:26:57] little sailor she was wanting to shake
[1:26:59] everybody's hand at our house one night
[1:27:02] so I changed it up on her
[1:27:04] I give her Knuckles and said
[1:27:09] what does she want to do to everybody
[1:27:11] then it was no more handshaking
[1:27:14] it was knuckles
[1:27:15] because she saw somebody do it and so
[1:27:19] they were beginning to mimic so our
[1:27:20] children are watching everything we're
[1:27:22] doing from this size all the way up to I
[1:27:25] can't reach as tall as mine
[1:27:29] his size
[1:27:31] they're watching Lord help us
[1:27:33] I'll be honest and tell you I've failed
[1:27:37] I failed many times
[1:27:40] and I've told myself I wished I hadn't
[1:27:43] done that
[1:27:45] I wished I hadn't said that
[1:27:47] I
[1:27:48] wished I had
[1:27:51] implied that but I was comfortable in my
[1:27:55] own house
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:27:58] not only the children are watching but
[1:28:00] your neighbors are watching not only the
[1:28:02] neighbors are watching but those you're
[1:28:04] associated with are watching you the
[1:28:06] people at your church watch you the
[1:28:08] people you do business with in the
[1:28:09] markets they're watching you after your
[1:28:12] confession
[1:28:13] yeah
[1:28:14] if you say you're a Christian you better
[1:28:16] act like a Christian
[1:28:23] always he says reflect Christ in
[1:28:26] everything we do
[1:28:32] foreign
[1:28:36] are full
[1:28:39] I gotta say out of hypocrites
[1:28:46] I heard somebody once say that they were
[1:28:49] trying to witness to somebody and
[1:28:50] somebody said you know I would go church
[1:28:53] but ain't nothing but a bunch of
[1:28:54] Hypocrites there
[1:28:55] and he said well I'm sure we got room
[1:28:57] for one more come on down
[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:29:07] we can't be putting out a life in
[1:29:09] confession and not lining up
[1:29:12] it stumbles people
[1:29:15] Uzziah begin his Reign at 16 like I said
[1:29:18] he'd reigned for 52 years and I want you
[1:29:20] to notice
[1:29:22] as we get into our story here for the
[1:29:24] next 30 minutes or so I want you to
[1:29:26] notice as as we look at you Zaya and the
[1:29:28] story that he lived the Legacy he left
[1:29:30] behind where we're at in our day our
[1:29:32] hour in the United States in the world
[1:29:33] we live in it's very similar
[1:29:36] Uzziah reigned for 52 years and overall
[1:29:40] he was a good King he did what was right
[1:29:42] in the sight of God and what was
[1:29:44] according to what his father had done
[1:29:46] he'd been taught well he was doing good
[1:29:48] and he sought God in all the days of his
[1:29:51] life
[1:29:52] and he began to get in there and he
[1:29:55] would understand the visions of God
[1:29:57] and as look but watch what it says here
[1:30:00] in second chronicles all this is going
[1:30:03] good as long
[1:30:05] as long as he sought the Lord God that
[1:30:09] made him prosper
[1:30:13] so as long as Uzziah followed the
[1:30:15] handbook
[1:30:16] as long as he done what he was supposed
[1:30:18] to do
[1:30:20] the kingdom was being built
[1:30:23] the home was being increased
[1:30:26] the prophets were beginning to rise
[1:30:29] and as long as he followed what he did
[1:30:32] with the what the book said Prosperity
[1:30:34] was on the rise and use this was a
[1:30:38] powerful man
[1:30:40] a powerful man who led military against
[1:30:43] the Philistines who led military
[1:30:45] victories against other nations he was
[1:30:47] known as a strong man and the Bible
[1:30:49] tells us that his Fame spread as far as
[1:30:52] the entrance of Egypt
[1:30:56] oh
[1:30:57] this man was well known
[1:31:00] uziah
[1:31:01] was well known as a powerful powerful
[1:31:05] person
[1:31:08] life was good under uzziah's reign
[1:31:13] the United States is pretty good
[1:31:16] even in a bad shape it's pretty good
[1:31:21] Prosperity has been on the rise
[1:31:24] growth has been on the rise
[1:31:27] think back Tim let's just go back 10
[1:31:29] years and see what's happened
[1:31:31] many of us like I've said before better
[1:31:33] than we've ever been in our lives
[1:31:37] uzziah's reign
[1:31:39] produce that kind of environment
[1:31:42] but uzziah's life begin to end
[1:31:45] tragically because Uzziah it says he was
[1:31:49] strong in his heart and was lifted up to
[1:31:52] his destruction
[1:31:55] so Uzziah began to let a little thing we
[1:31:58] like to call Pride come into his life
[1:32:02] I am as good as anybody I have a right
[1:32:06] to what anybody else has or does
[1:32:09] I'm as good as anybody I can do what
[1:32:12] anybody else does it doesn't matter if
[1:32:13] they're priest or
[1:32:15] profile of the temple when I'll burn my
[1:32:19] own incense
[1:32:22] and he goes back there and he begins to
[1:32:24] burn the incense and the priests come up
[1:32:26] to him and says you can't do that
[1:32:28] that's not for you to do
[1:32:31] and that's a big problem around the
[1:32:33] message we got people trying to burn
[1:32:35] incense teach the word preach the word
[1:32:37] that has no business preaching teaching
[1:32:39] or prophesying the word
[1:32:43] it's not their position
[1:32:45] and it causes people to fall it causes
[1:32:47] Nations to fall it causes kingdoms to
[1:32:50] fall and God looks down here and he
[1:32:53] looks at him and says you done wrong so
[1:32:56] now I've got to give you leprosy
[1:33:01] and because of what you've done uziah
[1:33:03] you will now live the rest of your life
[1:33:06] in isolation
[1:33:11] the most rain on the face of the Earth
[1:33:12] for 52 years
[1:33:16] disobeys
[1:33:18] one time
[1:33:21] thinks of itself a little more than what
[1:33:24] he is
[1:33:25] you know the boy the word says that
[1:33:26] Pride goeth Before Destruction and a
[1:33:29] holy spirit before the fall
[1:33:32] with all the successes in his life
[1:33:35] everything that he had accomplished and
[1:33:37] done you still can't bypass the handbook
[1:33:43] in the words of my mama
[1:33:45] she said boy you're getting too big for
[1:33:47] your britches
[1:33:49] Uzziah was getting too big for his
[1:33:52] britches he thought of himself a little
[1:33:55] more than what he was
[1:33:56] so this Kingdom now the Uzziah reigned
[1:34:00] over
[1:34:02] is that destruction
[1:34:05] because because now
[1:34:08] Ayah has died
[1:34:10] he was a great and wise King and Isaiah
[1:34:14] sitting here looking out here now and
[1:34:16] Isaiah is now finds himself discouraged
[1:34:20] because this was his mentor this was his
[1:34:22] friend this is his Confidant somebody he
[1:34:24] went to
[1:34:25] and he's now in here and he's he's
[1:34:27] beginning to get in here and he's going
[1:34:29] before the Lord at this tragedy
[1:34:31] and Isaiah is now saying God where are
[1:34:35] you and all this
[1:34:37] where are you in the tragedies of our
[1:34:40] life
[1:34:42] and Isaiah's setting here let me tell
[1:34:44] you where he was at he was at the altar
[1:34:46] in the temple
[1:34:49] that's why I say it we shouldn't be
[1:34:51] ashamed to come to the altar in the
[1:34:53] temple
[1:34:55] and he's here at the altar of the temple
[1:34:57] and he's crying out and says God where
[1:34:58] are you in all this
[1:35:00] and the vision then Pops in his head and
[1:35:02] it says I saw the Lord
[1:35:06] sitting on a throne
[1:35:08] so now you got to see the picture of
[1:35:10] this
[1:35:12] Throne Room Vision that Isaiah is having
[1:35:15] Isaiah's now said in there and he sees
[1:35:18] God sitting on a throne and thrown in
[1:35:20] heaven why was God there God was setting
[1:35:23] up on this Throne to tell Isaiah that no
[1:35:25] matter if King Uzziah is gone or not I'm
[1:35:29] still in control and brothers and
[1:35:32] sisters we go through things in our
[1:35:33] lives we go through troubles and trials
[1:35:35] and hardships whether it's brought on us
[1:35:37] by us or by others God is still on the
[1:35:41] throne
[1:35:44] the throne signifies a sovereign King a
[1:35:48] throne signifies a judge a throne
[1:35:50] signifies Authority and Isaiah may have
[1:35:53] been depressed but God is still on the
[1:35:56] throne and he said he was high and
[1:35:59] lifted up
[1:36:00] here is God Now setting up on this
[1:36:03] Throne high and lifted up and all of his
[1:36:06] majesty picture yourself Through The
[1:36:08] Eyes of Isaiah as you're looking at this
[1:36:10] pitch
[1:36:11] you're
[1:36:14] and go Temple
[1:36:17] his train filled the temple now back in
[1:36:19] those days men didn't normally wear
[1:36:21] trains on their ropes only Kings and
[1:36:25] hierarchies
[1:36:29] because it was it was too hard to work
[1:36:31] in it it was too Troublesome you had to
[1:36:33] have somebody move it but if you could
[1:36:34] imagine what Isaiah's seeing as he looks
[1:36:37] up and he sees God sitting on the throne
[1:36:39] surroundedly high and lifted up and his
[1:36:42] train fills the temple so can you
[1:36:45] imagine God sitting on a throne and the
[1:36:47] train of his robe is the carpet of this
[1:36:49] building
[1:36:56] completely fills the upholstery of the
[1:36:59] throne room
[1:37:06] and above it stood of seraphim or
[1:37:09] seraphims
[1:37:11] surrounding the throne
[1:37:13] these angels seraphims cherubbles known
[1:37:16] as The Burning ones
[1:37:18] because their their appearance was so
[1:37:21] bright and it was like fire and it said
[1:37:23] it was like the Bible tells us I think
[1:37:24] in Ezekiel that these these charitable
[1:37:27] the seraphims would move back and forth
[1:37:29] through through the throne room and it
[1:37:31] would be like lights of flashing
[1:37:33] lightning back and forth so much that
[1:37:35] Isaiah was hard for him to look upon him
[1:37:38] and they're moving back and forth back
[1:37:41] and forth the burning ones coming around
[1:37:43] and each has six things
[1:37:46] you got to you got to stay with me see
[1:37:48] this picture Lord help them help us all
[1:37:50] to see this picture
[1:37:52] help us to see this throne room picture
[1:37:55] you got these angels these Sarah films
[1:37:57] with six wings
[1:37:59] two of the Wings to cover their face
[1:38:03] why do they have to cover their face
[1:38:06] they had to cover their face because the
[1:38:08] Divinity the divine presence the
[1:38:10] brightness of God they couldn't even
[1:38:12] look upon them because even though they
[1:38:14] were divine they were too lowly the
[1:38:17] Angels themselves were too lowly to even
[1:38:19] put their eyes upon God
[1:38:22] yeah
[1:38:24] and Isaiah has taken all that
[1:38:27] the sin
[1:38:28] and with two Wings they covered their
[1:38:31] feet
[1:38:33] they had come humble
[1:38:35] in the presence of God
[1:38:37] why do we wash feet
[1:38:39] to show our humility
[1:38:41] because it's dirty
[1:38:44] our feet are nasty they're stinky
[1:38:47] they're filthy
[1:38:49] think about walking in sandals and
[1:38:50] manure
[1:38:54] and the two they covered their feet to
[1:38:56] be humble before God
[1:38:59] so their eyes are covered their faces
[1:39:01] are covered their feet are covered and
[1:39:03] with two they fly back and forth and
[1:39:05] what are they doing as they fly back and
[1:39:06] forth they're at God's beck and call
[1:39:09] they're bidding God's business whatever
[1:39:11] God needs he sends them back and forth
[1:39:13] back and forth back and forth
[1:39:18] so the two Wings cover their face
[1:39:22] they couldn't endure the brightness of
[1:39:23] God
[1:39:25] two covered his feet with two they flew
[1:39:30] willing to serve God
[1:39:33] and while they're there they begin to
[1:39:35] cry holy holy holy
[1:39:40] Stay With Me God on the throne high and
[1:39:43] lifted up his train fills the temple the
[1:39:45] seraphim's flying back and forth with
[1:39:47] such brightness that I can't even be
[1:39:49] looked upon and there too hum they have
[1:39:51] to be so humble and they're so lowly
[1:39:53] that they can't look upon God and
[1:39:55] Isaiah's taking all this in and now he
[1:39:57] hears holy holy holy is the Lord
[1:40:03] holy holy holy is the Lord
[1:40:08] have you ever wondered why they didn't
[1:40:10] just say holy is the Lord
[1:40:14] in English
[1:40:15] [Music]
[1:40:16] we use words great greater greatest
[1:40:20] Hebrew don't use those words
[1:40:23] so what they're saying is Holy Holier
[1:40:26] holiest
[1:40:30] they're flying back and forth and said
[1:40:32] this is the holy God
[1:40:34] this is the god that's
[1:40:35] any other
[1:40:37] is the very God that is the holiest of
[1:40:39] all holies this is the king of kings the
[1:40:42] Lord of lords
[1:40:43] and the throne room all of this is
[1:40:45] taking place holy holy holy
[1:40:54] do you realize that if all of creation
[1:40:56] were to dissolve today
[1:40:59] God still sits on a throne
[1:41:01] [Applause]
[1:41:03] he was Elohim
[1:41:05] at one time the self-existing one
[1:41:09] he didn't need it
[1:41:12] he desired us
[1:41:14] and he had desired us to be as he is
[1:41:18] he desired us to be like he was
[1:41:22] so by looking at this he sets himself
[1:41:25] apart from Humanity
[1:41:27] you have God you have Humanity over here
[1:41:29] you have God you have Humanity but then
[1:41:32] they all come down they come together
[1:41:36] and you begin to look at this
[1:41:38] and the Bible tells us that yet because
[1:41:40] we are made in the image of God
[1:41:46] are you with me
[1:41:49] we are made in the image of God
[1:41:54] so this is how Jesus could come and add
[1:41:56] Humanity
[1:41:59] to the world
[1:42:01] the holy spirit is how we can add
[1:42:04] God into the world and the divine
[1:42:07] presence of God into our lives
[1:42:10] brother I said now did you realize that
[1:42:11] being the person you are
[1:42:15] being the person that you are
[1:42:17] you're not all together flesh
[1:42:20] he said your spirit and flesh
[1:42:23] not only that but Jesus said that the
[1:42:25] Bible said that you are
[1:42:27] in a miniature way gods
[1:42:33] so that doesn't leave us much excuse to
[1:42:35] be
[1:42:36] doing this doing that going here going
[1:42:38] there seeing this saying that
[1:42:44] you know I I I tell
[1:42:47] the kids that I work with on the
[1:42:49] baseball team I say why did you do that
[1:42:53] and they try to give me some long excuse
[1:42:55] I don't hear no excuses you know better
[1:42:57] and I wonder sometimes if God don't look
[1:42:59] at us that way
[1:43:01] and he's thinking why did they do that
[1:43:04] and then we try to come up well you know
[1:43:07] I've seen this and it kind of caught my
[1:43:09] attention that was a little flashy in
[1:43:10] front of my face and I just grabbed a
[1:43:12] hold of it and before I knew it I was
[1:43:14] hooked and he says don't give me your
[1:43:16] excuses you knew better
[1:43:21] you knew better
[1:43:27] he said your miniature gods minutes your
[1:43:30] way God Jesus said that if prophets and
[1:43:32] so forth in the Old Testament Jesus was
[1:43:34] referring to and said it is written in
[1:43:35] your law that's your gods and if then
[1:43:37] God's the word of God come to and then
[1:43:39] why not himself being the Son of God
[1:43:41] when he makes himself equal with God we
[1:43:45] are in an amateur way creators
[1:43:51] um
[1:43:58] these seraphims these Majestic beings
[1:44:01] their voices carrying weight back and
[1:44:04] forth
[1:44:05] and as they cry holy holy holy
[1:44:10] with such power and such Authority that
[1:44:13] the very doorpost of the throne room of
[1:44:15] God shakes before Isaiah's faith
[1:44:21] and Isaiah begins to see this and he
[1:44:24] sees the shaking of the doorpost and it
[1:44:27] says that this the house was filled with
[1:44:29] smoke
[1:44:31] the presence of God
[1:44:33] in the room
[1:44:35] if the doorposts were to be shaken
[1:44:37] because the Angels cry holy holy holy
[1:44:41] how much more should this building be
[1:44:43] shaken if we have the same heart if we
[1:44:46] would sing with the same intensity to
[1:44:48] God as the Angels sing Holy Holy Holy
[1:44:55] and sometimes we and I'm guilty
[1:44:59] we're not in the mood
[1:45:02] to sing
[1:45:05] and we sit
[1:45:08] and we sit
[1:45:10] who suffers for that is it is it God no
[1:45:14] no it's us
[1:45:18] I have found when I'm not in the mood or
[1:45:20] I don't like the song Leader song and I
[1:45:22] don't like the the key that it sung in
[1:45:24] and I saw up like a bullfrog eating
[1:45:27] Buckshot I'm the one that suffers
[1:45:30] because I leave grumbly
[1:45:32] and I leave upset I didn't get to sing
[1:45:35] tonight because they don't sing in my
[1:45:37] key
[1:45:42] I'll be honest we went to Johnson City
[1:45:46] Youth Services couple weeks ago good
[1:45:49] great Services brother brother Aaron
[1:45:51] that's coming here you're in for a treat
[1:45:53] if you've never heard him you're in for
[1:45:54] a treat
[1:45:57] but I always look forward to the song
[1:45:59] service I love to sing
[1:46:02] I'm not good but I love it I better it
[1:46:05] okay we know that
[1:46:06] and I get that man I'm ready for this
[1:46:09] this
[1:46:10] heart up service and that brother
[1:46:12] is saying like an angel but he sang in
[1:46:15] an Angelic key that I could not sing
[1:46:19] I just sang off key I said forget it
[1:46:26] I was a little discouraged
[1:46:29] I was a little let down
[1:46:31] but I wanted to make sure that God knew
[1:46:34] that I cared enough to share my voice
[1:46:36] and give back and say God thank you I
[1:46:39] worship you I send you my glory I send
[1:46:41] you my praise because you have done so
[1:46:43] much for me
[1:46:46] you saved my sin sick soul
[1:46:49] with the Bloodshed on Calvary
[1:46:55] and here's where we get to our message
[1:46:59] Isaiah
[1:47:01] is seeing all this
[1:47:04] taking it in keep the picture in your
[1:47:06] mind
[1:47:07] and the only words that can be uttered
[1:47:10] out of his mouth is woe is me
[1:47:17] I am undone
[1:47:20] the prophet of God
[1:47:23] woe is me
[1:47:26] I am undone
[1:47:28] Isaiah looks at this situation now
[1:47:31] Isaiah looks at this situation and and
[1:47:34] he begins to come apart
[1:47:36] he understands and he realizes that he's
[1:47:38] been Measuring Up himself compared to
[1:47:40] others
[1:47:41] it's by what standard do you measure
[1:47:44] yourself up to
[1:47:46] Isaiah begins to look and he's thinking
[1:47:48] I'm a pretty good guy I've been doing
[1:47:50] this for a long time I've got good
[1:47:51] friends I got church people I know
[1:47:53] people
[1:47:55] I'm good friends with the pastor
[1:48:00] and then all of a sudden he looks at the
[1:48:02] very presence of God
[1:48:04] and he sees himself
[1:48:07] in the presence of God
[1:48:10] and trembles
[1:48:11] says whoa
[1:48:14] what was me
[1:48:16] for I am undone
[1:48:19] I'm but a sinner
[1:48:23] he goes back to that self-evaluation
[1:48:27] we many times don't see our faults
[1:48:30] Isaiah didn't see his faults
[1:48:33] because in the presence woe is me
[1:48:38] he sees the angels and all their holy
[1:48:41] humility their obedience to God their
[1:48:44] praising God back and forth holy holy
[1:48:47] holy and he realizes not only that it
[1:48:49] was he not unlike the Lord
[1:48:51] he was not even unlike the angels
[1:48:57] he couldn't even do what the Angels had
[1:48:59] done after all that God had done in his
[1:49:01] life
[1:49:03] whoa it's me
[1:49:06] they cry holy holy holy and praise God
[1:49:09] over and over and over
[1:49:11] and he couldn't do it
[1:49:15] because he was a man of unclean lips
[1:49:21] and he begins to exhibit he says I'm a
[1:49:22] man of unclean lips I can't cry holy I
[1:49:26] came out in the presence of God I can't
[1:49:28] even stand in the presence of God and
[1:49:30] cry holy because of the life I'm living
[1:49:35] the prophet of God for his day
[1:49:44] and he saw the Lord
[1:49:47] and he knew what man he really was
[1:49:51] he didn't measure it up by theology
[1:49:55] he didn't measure it up by somebody's
[1:49:57] ideas not his own ideas
[1:50:00] not the church's ideas
[1:50:02] but he measured up his life to the very
[1:50:05] presence of God
[1:50:12] how many of us this morning would say
[1:50:14] in the presence of God I find myself
[1:50:20] woe is me
[1:50:22] woe is me
[1:50:29] he saw what kind of man he was and the
[1:50:31] more he looked the more he knew what he
[1:50:33] was
[1:50:34] and at that point in his life Isaiah no
[1:50:37] longer had Pitchfork religion
[1:50:42] he said ah
[1:50:44] I am unclean
[1:50:48] he didn't say I wish brother so and so
[1:50:50] could have been here so he could heard
[1:50:51] that message that was right down his
[1:50:53] Avenue
[1:50:55] now he didn't say that
[1:50:59] woe is me
[1:51:02] ah
[1:51:04] ah am unclean
[1:51:10] because I'm a man of unclean lips and I
[1:51:14] dwell in the midst of people with
[1:51:15] unclean lips
[1:51:18] sinfulness was exposed
[1:51:21] you know I don't have to stand up here
[1:51:23] and call I have not I've not called out
[1:51:25] one thing that I would consider sin
[1:51:28] because you know what's hindering your
[1:51:30] life
[1:51:31] I know what's hindering my life
[1:51:35] I can't line myself up with anybody in
[1:51:38] this building
[1:51:40] but I have to look up to the throne room
[1:51:43] I have to look up to the throne room to
[1:51:46] the very eyes and to the very presence
[1:51:48] of God and cast my eyes there and say
[1:51:50] Woe Is Me Lord
[1:51:52] I have fallen short in this part of my
[1:51:56] life
[1:52:03] and he says my eyes
[1:52:06] my eyes have seen the king the Lord of
[1:52:08] hosts
[1:52:13] brothers and sisters Isaiah was a
[1:52:15] righteous man Godly by all outward
[1:52:18] appearances
[1:52:19] but when he saw the enthroned king the
[1:52:22] Lord of hosts he saw how sinful he
[1:52:25] really was
[1:52:27] and one of these Sarah found seeing
[1:52:29] Isaiah in total despair
[1:52:32] aren't you glad God sees our despair
[1:52:36] that will you know that when you come to
[1:52:38] the altar when you sat down on your
[1:52:40] knees before God and you fall down and
[1:52:42] say God I'm not holy I can't even cry
[1:52:44] holy because of the life I'm living
[1:52:47] that he says I see your despair son
[1:52:50] I see your despair daughter I see where
[1:52:55] you're standing and now because I know
[1:52:58] deep down inside you truly love me you
[1:53:01] truly adore me and you truly want to be
[1:53:03] in my presence I will send you fire from
[1:53:07] heaven
[1:53:09] Isaiah stood there in the presence of
[1:53:11] God and the center fam goes over to the
[1:53:13] altar of God with tongs and picks up a
[1:53:16] lighted cold and touches it to the tip
[1:53:19] of his of his lips
[1:53:23] laughs
[1:53:25] that coal was burning and it was hot
[1:53:32] do you think that hurt Isaiah
[1:53:37] the Bible doesn't tell us he felt any
[1:53:39] pain
[1:53:40] you say well you know how would we know
[1:53:42] what he thought he told us everything he
[1:53:44] saw heard and witnessed in that room
[1:53:47] did that say anything about pain
[1:53:50] but Deliverance
[1:53:53] fire that come down from heaven from the
[1:53:55] coals of the altar touch the tip of his
[1:53:58] lips and and touched and burned off all
[1:54:01] the sin in his life brothers and sisters
[1:54:03] what happened to Jeremiah well he wasn't
[1:54:06] adequate to share the word of God he
[1:54:09] said God went down and touched his lips
[1:54:10] what happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:54:12] when they gathered in the upper room the
[1:54:15] fire fell in tongs of fire touch their
[1:54:18] lips and they began to speak in unknown
[1:54:20] tongues there's something about when the
[1:54:22] fire of God comes it cleanses it opens
[1:54:25] up a vessel for God to enter in where
[1:54:28] ourselves matter no more but it's us
[1:54:31] being filled with God
[1:54:39] listen to this as we get ready to close
[1:54:43] the cherubims took the tongs and the
[1:54:45] coal of fire from The Altar and touched
[1:54:48] them unclean Lips This is the prophet
[1:54:50] speaking
[1:54:51] and he turned him from a coward
[1:54:54] he turned him from an educated man
[1:54:55] turning from a teacher to a prophet that
[1:54:59] the word of God could speak through
[1:55:03] turned him into a world into a man that
[1:55:05] the word of God could speak through sure
[1:55:07] while he was in the presence of God it
[1:55:09] was something different that thirst that
[1:55:11] he had had it had reached that place
[1:55:14] then till he was filled with it
[1:55:19] the very thing he'd been living his
[1:55:21] whole life for the very thing he desired
[1:55:23] the most when he he couldn't find out
[1:55:26] what is it I'm missing God In The
[1:55:28] Presence he said I know what it is I
[1:55:30] need more of you
[1:55:34] I need the busyness of this life out of
[1:55:37] my life I need the muck and the mirror
[1:55:40] in the mud out of my life
[1:55:43] he says let me tell you friend I don't
[1:55:45] care how many churches you join how many
[1:55:47] names you put on your on the book
[1:55:49] whether you're sprinkled or baptized or
[1:55:51] whatever you are until you meet that
[1:55:54] person Jesus Christ
[1:55:59] I'm not saying there's a single one of
[1:56:01] you here that's not saved I know I
[1:56:03] believe most of us most all of us in
[1:56:05] here has met Jesus Christ
[1:56:07] but there's a different kind of meeting
[1:56:10] there's a different kind of meeting when
[1:56:12] you go into that throne room
[1:56:15] and he says emotions won't do it
[1:56:18] a lot of times we want to lean on that
[1:56:21] excitement emotions just like when I
[1:56:23] went to the Johnson City I wanted that
[1:56:24] so bad to enter in and sing and just oh
[1:56:31] I wanted that
[1:56:34] but what I found is what I needed was
[1:56:36] the word
[1:56:38] and he said emotions won't do it you
[1:56:41] might jump up and down and shout as long
[1:56:42] as you want to you might run up and down
[1:56:44] the floor you might speak in tongues I
[1:56:46] would love to see all of that
[1:56:48] he said as much as you want to them
[1:56:50] things are good and holy I don't say
[1:56:52] nothing against it but until you meet
[1:56:54] that person
[1:56:56] listen to who that person is he says
[1:56:58] that satisfying portion
[1:57:03] you can't be satisfied until you meet
[1:57:06] God he said that satisfying portion is
[1:57:09] something that takes every fiber in your
[1:57:11] body not by emotion but by satisfaction
[1:57:16] let's stand
[1:57:27] musicians if you'd come
[1:57:30] I know there's a lot of information this
[1:57:32] morning
[1:57:33] in the scriptures there
[1:57:37] but I trust you saw the picture
[1:57:41] I trust that God has spoken to your
[1:57:44] heart
[1:57:45] trust that you examine yourself in the
[1:57:48] mirror this morning
[1:57:55] sister Becky if you just play something

[1:58:09] piano

[1:58:15] so we're not in a rush

[1:58:53] something in your heart that pricked
[1:58:55] your heart this morning that would cause
[1:58:58] you to look in the very presence of God
