[34:14] under the bridge really fast amen
[34:18] thank you musicians appreciate it amen
[34:21] appreciate your work for the lord amen
[34:24] may god richly bless all of you
[34:26] amen so i have a message that i have
[34:29] been thinking about
[34:31] for a little while came in and uh
[34:34] i've been wanting wanting to speak on
[34:37] this in this direction for a while but
[34:40] i never just really got it so i think
[34:43] yesterday is when i just kind of begin
[34:44] to think about it and
[34:46] see just try to listen that still small
[34:48] voice so i just feel like
[34:50] you know the lord impressed upon me
[34:52] perhaps to speak on this at this time
[34:54] amen so i trust it'll be a blessing to
[34:58] you
[34:59] this morning it is about a
[35:03] everyday christian life amen
[35:07] just to everyday christian life amen
[35:11] and so that's kind of direction that i
[35:12] want to go with the help of the lord
[35:15] amen and so elena may
[35:18] she's gonna gonna be baptized today so
[35:21] we're very happy for that
[35:22] amen nine years old anywhere from six to
[35:25] nine somewhere in there will baptize
[35:27] them if they express a real desire
[35:29] for wanting to be baptized they meant
[35:31] jesus said bring the little children
[35:33] unto me
[35:34] and forbid them not for such is the
[35:36] kingdom of heaven isn't that right
[35:38] so anyways we're very thankful for her
[35:41] for that
[35:42] and may god bless her and her life amen
[35:45] good to see everybody out this morning
[35:47] god bless you
[35:48] it's good to see everybody amen in the
[35:50] house of the lord
[35:52] amen i can't think of any other
[35:55] announcements thank you for your prayers
[35:57] with the water i mean we finally
[35:59] located uh located the
[36:03] area of the leak amen and isolated it
[36:06] put a shutoff on it so that we could
[36:09] have service here without a problem
[36:11] amen and so from the looks of it it
[36:14] wasn't up in the
[36:15] congregation this church part but we
[36:18] traced it right up to the edge of the
[36:19] pavement going into
[36:21] tarza fellowship hall so it's looking
[36:23] like it's somewhere
[36:25] under the pavement uh between the
[36:27] pavement and the fellowship hole there
[36:29] and so we'll probably have to either dig
[36:31] a trench under uh the fellowship hall
[36:33] which i think
[36:34] you know we already got a price for that
[36:36] be running around probably 12 to 1500 to
[36:39] dig a trench under or we can tap
[36:42] onto the line on the other side of the
[36:44] driveway and go down around
[36:46] amen just through the field and back up
[36:48] and circle up that way
[36:50] so we'll decide which way one will go
[36:52] with that amen but it looks like with
[36:54] the help of the lord we'll be able to
[36:55] get it fixed
[36:56] amen we appreciate everybody's prayers
[36:58] it certainly
[37:00] was a little bit frustrating there amen
[37:02] when i just couldn't seem to find a
[37:03] water line anywhere
[37:05] i had good water coming out of the
[37:06] ground but no water line cell
[37:09] and i would call the county i said hey
[37:11] y'all got anybody can find a water leak
[37:14] sure no problem but we just don't do
[37:17] private
[37:18] people you know because you got to have
[37:20] a schematics or whatever we've got to
[37:21] know where your water lines are
[37:23] amen and so anyways that's what they
[37:25] told me i said well here we go
[37:27] let's dig another hole so we dug a
[37:29] couple more holes
[37:30] amen and we finally found it with the
[37:32] grape by the grace of the lord and
[37:34] it did some strange things i don't know
[37:35] if tommy's here this morning or not but
[37:37] it did some
[37:38] different stuff amen but anyway by god's
[37:40] grace we got to shut off on it so
[37:42] we're thankful for that amen
[37:46] amen stand with me if you will this
[37:47] morning we'll go to the word of god
[38:03] genesis if you will genesis and i want
[38:06] to take my time this morning if that's
[38:08] okay
[38:09] if everybody's got a good comfortable
[38:11] seat i don't want to rush it
[38:13] i just want to uh um
[38:16] [Music]
[38:17] take my time with the help of the lord
[38:19] and you know
[38:21] i really think that a good long service
[38:24] wouldn't hurt us none of you
[38:26] amen but uh on the other hand i know
[38:28] what it's
[38:29] like to sit there and after you've heard
[38:32] different preachers
[38:32] say something to the extent that the
[38:35] mind can only comprehend what the seat
[38:37] can bear
[38:38] or something like that because when you
[38:41] get really tired of sitting and fidgety
[38:43] you know you might really like it but
[38:45] it's you're uncomfortable and
[38:47] us human beings we like to be
[38:48] comfortable don't we
[38:50] amen but anyway so praise the lord amen
[38:54] be thankful how much that for the seats
[38:56] that we do have
[38:58] these seats was given to us by another
[39:00] church amen
[39:01] and so that was a wonderful blessing
[39:03] amen that was just one of the great
[39:04] things that god did for us
[39:06] when we were trying to finish this
[39:07] building amen and
[39:09] and so he always supplied we're thankful
[39:11] for that
[39:12] all right let's turn to genesis 5
[39:20] and verse 24. genesis 5
[39:24] and verse 24.
[39:29] enoch and enoch walked with god
