In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. And one cried unto another and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory. me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. For mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts. And he laid it upon my mouth and said, "Lo, this hath touched my thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. And he said, "Go and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but understand not, and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate. &gt;&gt; This one together. But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and it shall be eaten as a tile tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them. When they cast their leaves, so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beloved this morning with all your heart. Amen. Let's sing that little chorus. I will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart this morning. Amen. Well, I will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter his courts with praise.

And we I thought I'd messed up because I'm not very savvy. This is a smartphone, but it's not a very smart person that operates it. And I I kind of got frustrated at me, but it wasn't me. I I text brother Shawn and them and they said, "No, Brother David, it's not working right." And I said, "Well, thank you, Lord. I didn't mess up."

Amen. Brother Michael John and brother Daniel and brother Caleb Dollar, would you come this morning? And we have some prayer requests this morning. And uh I have a friend of mine. He's actually my barber in Russellville. And some of you may know him. His name is Tony. And uh I know how he feels this morning because my dad had dementia and his dad is not doing very well. And and uh I told him we'd pray for him and I've been praying for his dad and I told him that we'd pray for him. And if you've never dealt with that in your family, you're a blessed person. I'll just tell you. Uh my mother passed away with cancer and I don't think it was as bad as what dad was with that because I felt like we lost him twice. But just remember them in prayer this morning. And also we want to remember sister Parish that God will continue to touch her body. And also uh sister Lisa has a headache this morning. Uh, Brother Caleb asked that we'd remember her in prayer this morning that God will touch her body this morning. And also, uh, uh, Sister Peggy Smith, she's in the hospital in in Madisonville. And, uh, I had talked to brother David this morning. Uh, I called him and asked him how she was doing. And uh he said for the most part she's doing pretty good, but she had a lot of fluid on her heart and they've gave her some medicine and her kidneys are not doing well. And and he he said she needs a touch from the Lord. He said if she gets up and does much of anything, uh he said she's just out of breath, which sister Peggy's been on oxygen for quite some time. But just pray that God will touch her body and they're going to move her to Morganfield. and when we find out when they move her and where she's at, we'll let the church know. But they desire your prayers and and just pray that God will just touch her body this morning and give her what she has need of. And remember those that are traveling. And before we pray, let's sing that little course. Touching Jesus is all that really matters this morning. Oh, touching Jesus, it's all that really matters. And then your life will never be the same. Oh, there is only one way to touch him. You must believe when you call on his name once again if we could this morning. Oh, and touching Jesus is all that really matterers. And then your life will never be the same. For there is only one way to touch him. You must believe when you call on. Amen. And I I forgot to read the first prayer request. continue to remember Sister McCagan and the twins this morning that God will just continue to move in a mighty way in their lives this morning. If you have need on your heart, you might let it be known with uplifted hand. And we're going to ask brother Caleb if he'd pray over the offering and these needs this morning. Yes. Amen. Let's sing a little chorus. So glad I'm yours. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours. So glad your mercy has followed me. So glad you found me and you set me free. So glad I'm yours, Lord.

Not just on Sunday, not just on Wednesday, but every single day I wake up, I just I want to share Jesus. I mean, I, you know, I feel like you getting the message and it's like I want to keep it in a box. Well, I don't want to. I want to share it with the world. I, you know, uh, Brother Bam says stay with your ABCs. So, I'll stay with my ABCs and if if let bring in the fish and the lizards and let God do the increase.

Uh we greet you in the name of Jesus Christ and brother Larry Harris says hello back in uh back at home. It's only a two-hour drive for us now so it's not far for us to drive. So God bless you.

We come into his house to worship him today. But I just want to worship him every day of my life. I just thank thank him for the goodness of God. I was just thinking about this this lyrics this morning. this this song that goes, "All my life you have been faithful." Oh, let's just sing it to him. Think about your life. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness Oh, sing it to him again from your heart. &gt;&gt; All my life you have been. &gt;&gt; Yes, you have, Lord. And all my life you have been so so good. Every breath that I have made, &gt;&gt; I will sing. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's sing it once more for me. Make it your prayer this morning. All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. Every breath that I &gt;&gt; will sing of the goodness of God. Oh, is that your prayer? Father, we love you, God. All my life you've been faithful. Times I didn't see her. I didn't see. I didn't feel you. Lord, I might have been a million miles in a gutter, but God, you are still along being faithful, watching over us. Lord, God, we're thankful today to serve you, not just a million other gods, but thee, Lord Jesus Christ. God, we're thankful that we have the revelation in our day. Our eyes have been open. The eyes haven't been applied. God, may you meet us today. Your word says you and two or three are gathered. You're in the midst. your word doesn't return void. God, I ask you come through every aisle. Father, help me get out of the way, Lord, that these lips would just be used for you and for what you'd want to have to say today. God, we study all night, but God, you would direct us and guide us in every aisle, every heart. We want to hear from you today, Lord. We love you. We dedicate this service. May you just look and may your angels encamp around us, Lord. When we talk about you, when we read your word, it's a promise that you come here. God, we love you, Father. We give you this service. Bless your people. Bless brother Ber, his faithfulness. Lord, I ask you bless him abundantly. Father, in Jesus Christ's name, we give you this service in Jesus name. And all people say, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. Let's just turn to him. God bless you musicians and we just love you this morning. Let's just turn to Corinthians this morning. First Corinthians chapter 15. First Corinthians chapter 15. We're going to go to verse 50. 1 Corinthians chapter 15. I'll try to not eat too much later where I can keep y'all awake. But uh but let's just eat on the word while we can today. That's what that's what we came here for. So 1 Corinthians uh 15 verse 50 it says here in verse 50 it says now this this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. It says neither do corruption inherit corruption. And it goes on to say verse 51 behold I show I show you a mystery. He says, "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed." Aren't you thankful today that there was many graveyards I passed today, but not everybody's dead in that graveyard? &gt;&gt; There's some Christians that's held on to the torch of faith and has fought the good fight of faith. And there, Brother Ram says, Christians don't die. Aren't you thankful? The Bible doesn't even say that Christians die. Aren't you thankful? If you've had a loved one pass away, they're not dead. But Ram said he's more alive then when he passed away than he was here. So hey, I'm just here to tell you that's the word of God. So it says, "We shall not sleep. We shall not all be changed." Verse 52, "In a moment, in a twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet, for the trumpet shall sound in the dead and shall be r raised incorruptible and shall be changed." Aren't you thankful for the promise today? No matter if you got by the grave or if I die in a car accident, I still will come up and and and and have a new body. Aren't you thankful? It goes on to say verse 53, for this incorruptible in this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. Verse 55, oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory? Aren't you thankful that that there's no more sting and death? Jesus Christ took the sting at Calvary. Aren't you thankful today that you woke up and you have a purpose this morning that he took the sting of death. If you, you know, you get around wasp or whatever, they bite you and they leave the stinger in you and they die. But I tell you, Jesus Christ paid the ultimate price for everything. And that's why you're here today. It never gets old. The gospel never gets old. I tell you, the more you study it, the more you listen to the tapes, it just an overflowing well on the inside. And the prophet of God says, "The more you pump the water, the more you get out of it." So, I just want to keep pumping water today. He says, "The sting of death is sin, and this and the strength of sin is the law." And I just want to focus this morning. This thought came to me. Maybe it's simple, but I like it. He says, "But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." Aren't you thankful? Thanks be to God. I think we can all say that today that thanks be to God. He's gave us victory not by you, not by your works, not by what you could bring to God today, but by Jesus Christ alone is your victory. But verse 58 says, "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast." Let's let's read this together. Unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. For as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. May you may be seated. I just want to focus on this word at the last sentence. It says, "For your lab, your labor is not in vain." &gt;&gt; Your labor is not If I could title it this morning, your labor is not in vain. Maybe you feel like I've been around this mountain. Maybe you feel like, "Hey, when I get on the road this morning, I'll just be honest with you. I was tired in my body. I The Lord said, "But your labor is not in vain. If it's just for one person this morning, it's worth it all. If it's just for me, praise God." But I'm here to tell you when you when you're in this message or you believe the word of God, it says he says in verse 30 58, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. It doesn't say to sit back and relax in the work of the Lord. It's always abounding. Always about my father's business. We should just not be sitting back and cruise control this morning. I I've traveled the world. I traveled them. I've been to Ecuador last year. I've traveled I've traveled overseas. I've traveled from state to state. And I'm here to tell you, we've gotten to a place I feel like a complacency in our lives where we we just believe a message. But I'm here to tell you, it's more than just believing a message. It's more than just quoting a quote book. It's more than just tolding to know all the quotes. BUT DO YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR TODAY? Do you know where he's brought you from? Do you know he's a living on the inside and you are written epistles read of all men. &gt;&gt; You are written epistles READ OF ALL MEN on your jobs or wherever you're at. Everybody's looking at you every day. &gt;&gt; They can care if you know the whole Bible or know the book. They want to know what's on the inside. &gt;&gt; That's like the prophet says, when the weakest Christian gets on their knees, the devil trembles. Can you imagine us if you're a prayed up Christian that knows God that really has a life consecrated before God? What the devil does? Does the whole thing have a earthquake every time you get on your knees? Does he not just tremble? But I thought about a prayed up person in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But I thought about a steadfast, unmovable, always abounding. He didn't say just sit back. He said always abounding in the work of the Lord. Just because you come into a message doesn't mean I'm Brother Chris, I'm good now. I'm just going to sit back, Brother Ber. I'm just going to relax. I'm going to let the preacher tell me a quote on Sunday. I'm going to let the let brother Ber spend all day on a Saturday and study and Friday and through the week just to come in here to hear the message. You should be hearing the message Monday through Friday and Saturday and Sunday. Not just on Sunday today. This should be an every day. Not just for the preacher but for the leoty alike. We should all COME IN THIS PLACE saying I've come to expect from you Lord. I come to be changed. I come to be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be re be re be re reborn. I be come to be refilled today. I become to get something from you Lord. An expectation is what we should come in here. NOT JUST ANOTHER SERVICE, NOT JUST ANOTHER SUNDAY SERVICE. But hey, this is for me, Lord. Not just to be sitting back, but to be standfast, unmovable, always abounding, &gt;&gt; always abounding. And I just brought that title out, your labor is not in vain. Because I believe there's a lot of things you can do in vain. I believe you can work too much, you can do that. Rebraham said, you can't pray enough. You can't pray too much. You can do this. You can do that. But I'm here to tell you, living this message, living the truth, young people, it's not in vain. &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. And I thought last night late into the hour about 2:00, I thought about Sister Hattie Wright because Sister Hattie Wright one time she said, "That's nothing but the truth." And he said, "What? I can give whatever you ask the Lord." She said, "I want the salvation on both boys." It wasn't in vain that when she heard the word, she agreed to it. And what you are agreeing to could change your destination today. Just by you saying amen to the word. Could change your destination. Could change your grandchildren. Could change your your your home today. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. First Corinthians, I was reading that, but I want to read another translation in verse 15, verse 58. He says in this translation, "So now, beloved ones, stand firm, stable, enduring. Live your lives with unshakable confidence." It says, "We know that we prosper and excel in every season by serving the Lord because we are assured that our union with the Lord makes our labor productive with fruit that endures." I'm talking about a a a tree that puts off fruit. You he we are the branches. He's the vine. Are you just sitting there today? Are you just sitting there saying, "Well, I'm just a tree. I'm not going to produce ANY FRUIT." GOD'S CALLED YOU out of this world. But you got to live in this world. But I'm here to produce some fruit today. And I tell you, it will take the reading of God's word every single day. And I'm praying that not saying that you won't have trials. That's when the trials come. I got a lot of trials, but I got a God that's bigger than every single trial. Every trial you're going through. Our God is still faithful. &gt;&gt; He is still a good God. &gt;&gt; I wrote that down. I was looking up the definition of steadfast. I'm just going to break this down for you today. I hope this is okay. This is the definition of steadfast. I wrote this down. It I looked this up. It said steadfast. It's firm. It's fixed. It's unwavering, dependable, consistently, and faithful. &gt;&gt; Let me read that again. Firm, fixed, unwavering, dependable, consistently faithful. I tell you, that's I pray God. I said, Lord, let me be that. &gt;&gt; Let me be firm, fixed, unwavering, dependable. Goes on to say, I was reading this. It says steadfast means to remain spiritual strong. Spiritually strong, firmly planted and committed no matter what pressure, distraction &gt;&gt; or difficulty that comes. &gt;&gt; Think about that today. No matter what pressure, no matter what distraction or def difficulty comes, think about that. Being steadfast. Just because someone leaves here or leaves the message or does this, you be steadfast, &gt;&gt; unmovable, unshakable. &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay. And I wrote this down. Firm and stable. And you're not easily to be shaken or moved. You have a you have a solid purpose. &gt;&gt; You have a you know your purpose here. I tell you, I I believe every one of us should figure out your purpose. Let the Lord show you your purpose in life. IF YOU'RE A HOUSEWIFE, BE THE BEST HOUSEWIFE. If you're the Sunday school teacher, be the best Sunday school teacher. If you're a businessman, be the best businessman. &gt;&gt; This world need Jesus. &gt;&gt; This world needs to see a little light of Jesus. Not just all camped into a building, but to be the hands and feet of Jesus out there. &gt;&gt; People want to see it. I was I was at a concert the other night the the night and the other night and I thought this one this guy looks at us he goes do I know you do I know you and I thought wow you know you just get around somebody we went through what a hundred people and all of a sudden he's like do we know you yeah we're we're all sons and daughters of a king &gt;&gt; there's a tenur spirit and I thought that's how we should be put off some KIND OF OIL LIKE a dove on the inside that comes radiating when you get around somebody, they go, "Do I know you? GOD, I FEEL LIKE I'VE known you before. I &gt;&gt; I just feel there's a presence around you. I FEEL LIKE I know you." &gt;&gt; Young people, THIS IS NOT JUST FOR YOUR PARENTS. This is for you, too. &gt;&gt; It's a walk with God alone. &gt;&gt; The problem God is a mystic. You're a mystic to the world. It's a walk. It's I'm going to tell you, it sometimes becomes a lonely walk. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not an easy walk, &gt;&gt; but it's a WORTHY WALK. IT'S A worthy calling. &gt;&gt; It's the best calling you could get today. You're You could get a call, my brother said, the president and be like, "OH MY GOSH, TRUMP, CAN Y'ALL BELIEVE Trump called me?" You could literally call, YOU WOULD CALL EVERYBODY. YOU'D have Brother Ber, they'd have Facebook blown up. Come here, Trump. Let me put my arm around you. But you know what? Know something greater than that? Jesus Christ has stepped for glory. AND HE'S CALLED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU BY NAME. And he's GAVE YOU A PURPOSE TO KEEP PRESSING ON. When trials seem tough, WHEN LIFE SEEMS TOUGH, when you think you ain't going TO MAKE IT, KNOW THAT YOU'RE SONS and daughters of the king. &gt;&gt; You've been called. You've been baptized. You took on his name. I'm speaking to bride today and I'm here to tell you if you haven't got that experience on the inside, I provoke you today before the end of the service to meet Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; to meet the author. Get an axe experience WITH GOD. YOUNG PEOPLE, THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO HOLD YOU IN THIS DARK WORLD. &gt;&gt; NOTHING ELSE WILL HOLD YOU. I CAN'T HOLD YOU. YOUR PARENTS CAN'T HOLD YOU. But Jesus Christ can hold you. They can hold you along the way. &gt;&gt; I wrote another word down. Be consistent and cons uh constant faithful every day. Not just on good days, &gt;&gt; but every day. &gt;&gt; On every day, be steadfast. You I'm telling you, it's like it is literally life is like a roller coaster. One day you're up, one day you're down. One day you're up. If you live off OF THAT DAY, I tell you what, we'd be some miserable people today. But aren't you glad that God sent a prophet in the land and has opened the book, opened the seals, and if Paul COULD COME BACK IN THIS DAY, he'd want to be in this day. &gt;&gt; But he chose you in THE DARKEST HOUR, KNOW. YOU MIGHT SEE a little bit of light, but there's barely any light left. &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking to every one of you today that you're a light to this world. BE A LIGHT IN THIS DARK WORLD. BE STEADFAST. BE UNMOVABLE, &gt;&gt; always abounding. &gt;&gt; Not just sit back and say, "Well, uh, God gave me the message. I'm going to go in the corner and hide and believe it." No. Shed a light. SHOW EVERYBODY. SHARE YOUR ABCS. Always believe Christ. &gt;&gt; That's how I got. Someone handed me a tape book, a book one day and said, "Hey, here here's Jezebel religion. Why you're nomination?" None of my family believed it. But there was that seed on the inside. There was that from the foundation of the world. They handed me a book from someone in the world just said a Christian came out of church and handed me a book and said, "Hey, read this. Listen to this. It changed my life 22 years ago. I'm here to tell you today I'm going to be unmovable, unshaken. I don't care IF EVERYBODY LEAVES. I'M STILL STANDING. You got to get an unmovroable, unshakable life. Always abounding. I wrote this down. Always be determined. Having your mind made up, young people, to follow God regardless of your feelings or circumstances. &gt;&gt; Regardless of your feelings or circumstances, be loyal, unwavering, standing strong in faith, the truth, and obedience. Just some things I wrote down. Steadfast means staying planted. Another place said staying faithful, staying focused. Who wants to be focused today? Say, Lord, I want to be planted no matter what comes. Unmovable. I looked that word up. There was so much in that one scripture. It says unmovable. uh unable to be to be pushed off course, shaken or shifted away from the truth of God's word. That's what I want today. Unable to be pushed off course, unmovable. It goes on to say, it describes someone spiritually anchored, refuses to be swayed by circumstances, opinions. Oh, I'm tell you today, there's a lot of opinions in this message. There's a lot of people will tell you, "Well, this and THAT AND THAT." I DON'T WANT IF IT AIN'T IN THE WORD OF GOD, I DON'T want your opinion. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't line back up from Genesis to Revelation, young people, then stay away from it. &gt;&gt; Opinions, don't be swayed by circumstances, opinions, pressure, or attacks of the enemy. Oh my. Firmly rooted. I wrote this down. We're firmly rooted in God's truth. Don't bend when the culture changes. Emotions shift or people disagree. Oh, I hope this is okay. &gt;&gt; You stand on what God said. No matter WHAT YOU SEE, NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE, YOUNG PEOPLE, NO MATTER WHAT AGE YOU ARE, NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE, and the world wants to go this way, you stand on God's word. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away, but my word shall not pass away. That's right. &gt;&gt; Clothe yourself with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be shaken by trials. I put this down. Storms may hit you, but you can't move from your foundation. I believe sometimes we've built the foundation on the faith and we haven't built it with on the right thing. We build it on the head knowledge. We build it on well, my parents go to church. My parents believe a message. It's got to get deeper than that. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be standing here today. There's some craziness that goes on. Brother Ber, I tell you, it seems like more in the message than anywhere. &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest. I'm just being real with you today. I would probably be unshaken, unmovable, but my ground IS NOT ON PEOPLE or opinions or how you feel. IT'S BASED ON THE WORD OF GOD. And from Genesis TO REVELATION, IT'S GOT TO BECOME A NEW BOOK TO you and me. &gt;&gt; The book has to become a new book. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't fell in love with the author today, I ENCOURAGE YOU, SAY, "GOD, I'M COMING BACK TO MY FIRST LOVE." &gt;&gt; Wherever you left God, if he's second or third or fourth place, put him first place today. &gt;&gt; Put him back first. &gt;&gt; It's like that guy with a geography book. I'm like that guy. I bet my wife tells me that. I bet she can tell me that today. She'd say, "Hey, honey, take the book here. Go walk up in the attic. Hey, there." No, she wouldn't do this. But I'm just saying a friend would come over, a worldly friend say, "Brother, here's a geography book." Yes. &gt;&gt; And I get up in the attic, brother Ber, and start to looking at the ocean and start I'll be starting dancing like that man BROTHER BROWN TALKED ABOUT &gt;&gt; CUZ I START TO SEE God in the ocean in the trees and what he's done for me. &gt;&gt; He didn't NEED A BIBLE BECAUSE HE KNEW THE AUTHOR. HE KNEW he saw it everywhere. &gt;&gt; He was unmovable, unshaken. No matter what, THEY CAN MAKE FUN OF HIM. And here he is in the attic praising God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be that. I want to be so unmovable, unshakable, &gt;&gt; full of God's glory, ALWAYS ABOUNDING IN the work of the Lord. &gt;&gt; If it's JUST FOR ONE PERSON, IT'S WORTH A 100 MILES. IT'S WORTH A THOUSAND MILES. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you y'all, I don't I was telling somebody today, we don't do it FOR THE MONEY. WE DO IT FOR one soul. He said, "One soul is worth 10 million worlds." &gt;&gt; I'll never forget my tax accountant said the other day. She said, "Sir," she said, "This business is doing good and this business is doing good, but this ministry ain't doing too well." I'm just being honest. That was last year. She said, "Well, you add up this, you add this." Well, you're negative here. I said, "Ma'am, THAT'S THE BIGGEST BANK ACCOUNT I GOT." &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest with you today. Man, I'm not here to feel sorry for me. I'm here TO TELL YOU, FEEL GOOD FOR ME because I'm here TO TELL YOU THAT'S THE BIGGEST BANK ACCOUNT YOU GOT. &gt;&gt; Your house is going to burn up. Your your metal's going to burn up. Everything you drove, everything you got, you can't take NOTHING WITH YOU. BUT THAT INSIDE MAN is going to have A CHANGE OF BODY ONE DAY. AND SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE, IN A MOMENT, A TWINKLING OF AN EYE, you will be changed. &gt;&gt; I WILL BE CHANGED. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE living for. &gt;&gt; That's what this crazy man up here looking crazy is for preaching today. &gt;&gt; But just leave me that way. I'm happy. &gt;&gt; I would rather be here than anywhere else. &gt;&gt; Even if it's just sitting in the pew, I say, "Lord, fill me up today. &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask you just fill me up. Give me another refilling. Lord, maybe your MAYBE YOUR CANDLE WICK, maybe it's just barely burning, is a little smoked up today. I tell you, wipe it OFF AND SAY, "LORD, fill me again. FILL ME ON THE INSIDE. GIVE ME THAT faith that's unmovable, unshakable, always abounding." &gt;&gt; Oh my. This might be a part two tonight because we ain't getting too far. But I thought about verse I wrote this down. anchored. You got to be anchored. Decisions are guided by the word, not your feelings or fear. &gt;&gt; Your decisions have to be guided by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Not because how you feel. Your emotions will take you everywhere. &gt;&gt; As brother Bram says, he says, "You can I I didn't feel great this morning, but I said, you know what? I'm not going off my feelings. But if I go by the inside, &gt;&gt; I go by the heart and say, "Lord, God, I just love you with all I got." &gt;&gt; But we got to our decisions can't be guided but only by the word. If you have a Bible question, there's a Bible answer. &gt;&gt; Young people, if there talks about always be I'm just here to tell you. I'm I'm getting on my notes, but here we go. I'm here to tell you, listen, if you're dating someone that's not equally yolked, you need to get rid of them. &gt;&gt; You need to get rid of them today. &gt;&gt; If they're not equally yolked, you're looking for a life of trouble. &gt;&gt; Life's hard enough when you're a Christian. You imagine marrying someone unequally yolked. &gt;&gt; I'm just here to tell you, don't do it &gt;&gt; just because they look good. As brother Brandon would say, paraphrasing for time, but give it 50, 60 years and then look at them again. Not saying they won't look good. I'm just saying when they get wrinkles and I'm just saying, &gt;&gt; even me, when I first met my wife, I was all in shape and she fed me so much it just keep getting bigger. But we still love each other. &gt;&gt; There's something at the inside to say, "You're my soulmate." &gt;&gt; And that's how we got to be with Jesus Christ. There's got to be something on the inside that your daddy doesn't tell you to read the Bible. The daddy doesn't TELL YOU TO GO PRAY IN your room &gt;&gt; or just to live in a home that loves God. But you have to get the real personal life on the inside &gt;&gt; if you want to be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding. &gt;&gt; So your labors in vain. I thought about this. We might go into this tonight, but I thought about this. I thought about this scripture in Matthew, if we could turn there for a minute. Matthew 26. Everybody knows the story. Matthew 26 verse 6. Matthew 26:6. It says, "Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box, a very precious ointment, and and poured it on his on his head, and he sat in me." Listen to this. And when his disciples saw it, they had ind indignation, saying, "To what purpose is this waste?" I never really caught that a lot. I mean, it might be simple to you today or simple to me, but I thought this Bible is not waste for you. &gt;&gt; What they call waste was her worship. &gt;&gt; What they call waste was her giving everything she's got to her Lord Jesus. What people call that are your waste. They might tell you you're wasting your life. You believe a cult. But what they call waste is your life. What they call waste out in THIS WORLD IS YOUR eternal destination. &gt;&gt; Think about that today. Oh, it says that that's what your purpose is. That to what purpose is this? She's asking the disciples, "Is this waste? For this ointment that might have been made that had been sold for so much and given to the poor?" Goes on to say, it says, "When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, why trouble ye woman, for she hath brought a good work upon me, for ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always." Verse 12. For in that so sheath that hath pou this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, what wherever it says, wheresoever the gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this this woman had done be told for a for memorial of her. So this oil she had, everything she got thought it was a waste. Even the disciples thought it was a waste. But guess what? It was not in vain. &gt;&gt; It was where is the scripture I'm speaking on today. It's not in vain. &gt;&gt; What you're doing is not in vain. Young people, every time you get up, every time you COME THROUGH THESE DOORS, IT'S not in vain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad when we can just read the scriptures and praise God that he doesn't just meet us in Jeffersonville, he meets us in every building that praises Jesus Christ. I was listening to the message this morning lifting our lifting God out of history. I think some of us in here need to lift him out of history. &gt;&gt; We need to stop leaving them on a bookshelf. Leaving them in for BROTHER BRANDHAM'S DAY. WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAY? WHAT ABOUT YOUR DELIVERANCE? WHAT ABOUT YOUR CANCER? WHAT ABOUT YOUR DIABETES? He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. We got to lift him out of THE HISTORY. HE'S NOT IN history book. He can deliver you. He's not in vain. &gt;&gt; You might feel like I come in here, brother. I come here. No, you come to hear from God. &gt;&gt; Every time you come in church, whoever it is, JUST SAY, "LORD, GIVE ME SOMETHING FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; Let him come through my aisle." &gt;&gt; But it's not in vain. I'm here to tell you, living this message, young people, is not in vain. &gt;&gt; Living it all is not in vain. Just like she did. They thought it was waste, but it wasn't. It was her eternal destination. &gt;&gt; What are you doing for Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; My question today is it's not in vain, but what are you doing with the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; Are you living a life worthy of the gospel? &gt;&gt; Not just for someone with a tie on today. I I fail every day. But I'm here to tell you, can we do something for Jesus? &gt;&gt; Maybe it's on your workplace. Maybe you give them $50. Maybe you give them a hundred and say, "Hey, I just felt led to give it to you." Maybe it's your last $50, but I'm here to tell you, I've reached in my pocket before and gave my last hundred and I'm here to tell you somehow we had $1,000 check in the box because God gives the increase. &gt;&gt; You got to trust God with everything. your finances with everything you got, give it to God. &gt;&gt; I always tell the boys, I said, "Boys, if something happens to daddy, you seek the kingdom first. You don't seek anything else. You seek the kingdom first and then everything else will be added." &gt;&gt; I've always had it backwards. I put this verse and that verse and that first in life. And then when I when I got to that scripture, I said, "Lord, let that be my life. Let me seek you first with everything I got and then everything will be added. You won't be begging for bread. You'll always have a roof over your head. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's only 600 square ft. Maybe it's a mobile home. Maybe it's a double wide. Whatever it is, but I tell you what, IT FEELS GOOD WHEN IT'S COLD OUTSIDE. &gt;&gt; I woke up the other day, Brother Ber, and I turned had the heat on. I said, "Thank you, God." Lord. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I WALKED OUTSIDE AND I SAID, "NOT TODAY, SATAN." I just being honest. You ask my wife, I I can't stand the cold. &gt;&gt; I walked in there. I said, "Not today." &gt;&gt; But I started looking. I SAID, "BUT GOD, TODAY YOU GAVE ME A ROOF OVER MY HEAD. You gave me food to eat. You gave me food in my pantry. How about you today?" I tell you that should put a SHOUT UNDER YOU. THAT SHOULD PUT A PUT A ZEAL IN YOUR HEART THAT YOU GOT A BED TO lay in. &gt;&gt; We would travel IN ECUADOR LAST YEAR. MANY HOUSES didn't merely have a roof, raining in the house, raining in the church. We were praising the Lord in one place, literally pouring wet, sweating wet, just just serving God. I said, "Lord, if they can WORSHIP LIKE THAT, I CAN WORSHIP LIKE THAT. I don't care how much water comes in here. The lightning was blowing one place. The metal ROOF WAS BLAZING. I SAID, "LORD, IF YOU TAKE ME HOME, I'LL STILL serve you." &gt;&gt; Most of us would take off running when we heard lightning. Oh my goodness, I got to go hide. But I tell you, it'd be good some today, get a little bit lightning in your life &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. It'd be good to let the Holy GHOST SWEEP THROUGH EVERY EYE, EVERY HEART, AND PUT SOMETHING THAT'S UNCHANGEABLE, STEADFAST, ALWAYS ABOUNDING. &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. I'm here to tell you today, if I can seek this in your heart, THIS WORD, THE STUDY IN YOUR PRAYER LIFE IS NOT IN VAIN. &gt;&gt; HEZEKIAH, THINK ABOUT THAT. BROTHER says he even ch his prayer CHANGED THE MIND OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Gave him 15 more years. I never thought in my PE brain that you could actually change the mind of God. BUT THAT YOUR PRAYER could change your situation could change the mind of God. &gt;&gt; He would look at you today if he could raise up and say it's not in vain. &gt;&gt; Your prayer life reading the word. You can read everything else. You can scroll Facebook for hours and hours and hours and hours. How much do you stroll down this &gt;&gt; from Genesis to Revelation? I know we don't have a backing, but I like it this way. I like it worn. My wife goes, "I got you four more new Bibles." I said, "Yeah, you'll have to figure that out. I I just like what I got. I it's getting all torn up. But I'm here to tell you I just like it because I know I feel like I can feel the imprints on each Bible page the and the tears that I've wept and said, "Lord, I need more of you." &gt;&gt; Have we got to a place we're so anchored in God that says, "God, I'm going to be steadfast, unmovable &gt;&gt; cuz it's not in vain." &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, we'll be accountable for what we tell you in these churches. And I'm here to tell you, it's not in vain. You living for God is the best choice you could ever live. Young people, get to Christ as fast as you can. IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN BAPTIZED, I say, "LET'S TURN THE WATER ON. NO MORE WAITING. THE ARK DOORS CLOSING." &gt;&gt; And when he shuts it, no man can open it. &gt;&gt; We won't be able to open it when it's the last one. Maybe it's the one in church today. I don't know. Maybe it's the one in the next church. I don't know. But I'm here to tell you, Brother Ber, if you get them in, praise God. &gt;&gt; I don't care who gets them in. I told Brother George Smith the other day, I WAS LIKE, "HEY, I DON'T CARE if you get THEM IN OR I GET THEM IN. I DON'T HAVE A CHECKLIST. JUST GET THEM IN. IF YOU GET THEM IN, I'LL HUG YOU AT THE WEDDING supper and say, "Praise God, Brother Joe. YOU GET HIM IN." I'm going to be like, "Brother, HE WAS ON YOUR JOB." &gt;&gt; Maybe it's somebody don't even look like a message believer. &gt;&gt; Too many times where Well, let me see. Brother Ber, let me just see how long your hair is. You know, if y'all would have saw me about 21, two, three years ago, you wouldn't even gave me grace. Shaped in iniquity, speaking lies, playing with the world. Young people, I'm here to tell you, it'll keep you longer than you want to stay. &gt;&gt; It'll hold you. The devil will put you on a gutter somewhere and say, "Hey, this is a real good life, but it ain't life with sin." And it's just for a season. It might feel good for a moment, but I'm here to tell you, it doesn't last long. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, ever since I met Jesus, ever since I got came to the author, it's done something for me. It's gave me a purpose to live. It's gave you a purpose to live. &gt;&gt; Maybe you woke up, oh, I'm tired and weary today. I'm here to wake you up and tell you to get steadfast in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Be unmovable. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Get anchored in Christ. I thought about this. Maybe this will encourage you. We want to talk about being steadfast. This is not in vain. We'll just call it it's not in vain. I thought about Hebrews. Turn to Hebrews. Hebrews 10. Turn to Hebrews 10. Thought about it's not in vain. Let's read this verse 10. It says, "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of things, can never with those sacrifice which were offered year by year continually to make the comers there unto perfect. For then would they would not have ceased to be offered, because they that that they worship once purged should have no one more conscious of sins. But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. It says for it is not possible for that blood of bulls and goats should take away the sins. I want you to understand it was a temporary covering. &gt;&gt; It was a they had to do it every single year. The priests had to go in with the bell and they had to go to the holiest of holiest to make intercession. &gt;&gt; And if you didn't hear that bell that mean they fell out. They might come in there unclean. They'd have to pull him out. &gt;&gt; But listen to this. Let's talk about not in vain. Verse N. But then said he, oh Lo, I come to thy will, oh God. He taketh away the first that it may be established the second. It says, but by wi by the which we shall are sanctified through all offering of the body of Jesus Christ. What? Once for all. &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. It's once for all. I DON'T CARE HOW FAR YOU WENT, HOW FAR YOU'VE GONE IN SIN. His sin, his grace is sufficient. &gt;&gt; It's once for all. &gt;&gt; It's a once for all covering. &gt;&gt; There you go. It's not in vain right here. And every priest standeth daily ministering offering often verse 11 the same sacrifices which can cover and take away sins. But this man Oh, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God. For henceforth, expecting to this enemies be made his foottool. &gt;&gt; For by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified. I like this verse 19. Having therefore brethren, listen to this, it's not in vain. boldness every one of us to to to the holiest into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you can enter enter into the holiest of holiest because Jesus Christ stepped down &gt;&gt; paid the ultimate sin ONCE FOR ALL. IT'S NOT IN VAIN. &gt;&gt; And it goes on to say, he says, "By a new living way." Hey, if you don't have a new and living way, I tell you today to get to the altar, get to your seat, turn around in the altar, in your pew, wherever you in your car, and say, "Lord, I want a new living way of which he had consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, and having a high priest over the house of God, let us draw what? near with a true heart, full assurance of faith, &gt;&gt; having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, our bodies washed with pure water. Verse 30, 2023. Let us hold fast to the profession of our faith with what? With what? Without wavering. &gt;&gt; For he that have faithful that promise, and let us consider one another to provoke, to love, and what? Good works. &gt;&gt; This will do us some good today. Verse 25, not forsaken the assembly of ourselves together as some manner some is. I could actually tell you a lot. There is some is. I better not go into detail, but there is some is today. As the manner of some is by exhorting one another and so much more as the day of approaching. I'm just thankful that I can take everything in this Bible and if it's not in here, I don't believe you. &gt;&gt; Every word's a lie. Brother said 99% is still a lie. But I want a 100% of it. Brother Joe, I want it all. I DON'T WANT NO WATERED DOWN GOSPEL. I WANT THE ENTIRE TRUTH. IF IT CLEANS ME UP, if it puts me on solid ground, and if if IT TAKES AWAY CANCER, I WANT THAT. IF IT TAKES AWAY DIABETES, if it heals your kids, IF IT SAVES YOUR GRANDCHILDREN, I WANT THAT. &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. You're not coming to church. It's not in vain, old people. It's not in vain. I bet you I bet you they would tell you it's not in vain. I bet you loved ones that's passed on would tell you today. My father-in-law preached this message all around the world for like 50 or 60 years. He just went with the Lord. And I preached his last sermon and he was sitting there and I said, "Lord, let me run this race like he did." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me run it with all I got. I would walk into his room the last hours of his day. His mind literally started slipping. I would walk through the door and he would literally ask Rachel. He would light up when you walk in the room and he say, "Brother Chris, you know what brother Bam says about this? You know what the B?" I was like, he wouldn't even know his name. He wouldn't barely know where he was some days, but he knew the Bible and he knew the message because it WAS ON THE INSIDE. IT WASN'T A MIND PROBLEM. IT WAS A HARD PROBLEM. I'm here to tell you to get IT ON THE INSIDE. LET IT BE A living witness read of all men. &gt;&gt; I'll be in a conversation with people sometimes, brother B. I don't know the scripture. I don't know that. I don't care. BUT I'LL TELL YOU, I'LL lead you to the author. &gt;&gt; If it could change this old boy, it could change everybody. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But it wasn't in vain when Christ has it said once for all. And it said, "Let us consider one another. Provoke us not forsaken the assembler of oursel." I'm here to tell young people, every time the doors are open, young people, old people, no matter what age you are, it's better than your gas station. It's better. It's better than your bank account. It's better than any money you can make. Because I'll tell you what, that's just two days a week you give to the Lord. Do you give them every single day? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. You give them every day. Young people, do you give them every day of your life? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not just when the preacher shows up and has studied a message or studied a book all week for one 40-minute service, but have you got in the book? &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you, church, to get in this book. Every bit of it is good. &gt;&gt; Genesis to Revelation. Every bit of it good. It's needed for you. It's needed for me &gt;&gt; because you're always waring this flesh and the inside. &gt;&gt; What dog, as he would say, what dog are you feeding the most? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which dog are you feeding the most? &gt;&gt; You'll know it when you get on the streets today. If you ain't fed the wrong dog, you get cut off. You're like, "Oh, Jesus, I'll take the wheel. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm human, too. I'm just being honest. &gt;&gt; Someone cuts you off. Lord Jesus, I know I'm saved. But you know something on the inside has changed. &gt;&gt; You know, every time you get up, you cannot stand. You don't want You want to come to church. You want to be We need each other. This is an hour, I'm here to tell you, we're living in a late hour that the backbiting's got to stop. Preacher against preacher, leoty against leoty, evangelist against ley. Uh this big preacher VERSUS THAT PREACHER. WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT. WE DON'T HAVE NO BIG EYES, little te's. We're all in it together. &gt;&gt; You don't HAVE A SPECIAL SEAT. WELL, brother Ber, I'm just going to give you a special seat at this table and down here. Brother Ber, you're going to sit here. You know, we're just going to be all at the table. &gt;&gt; I'm just YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A SPECIAL big somebody. I'M LOOKING FOR JESUS CHRIST to walk in and grab his te and wipe our tears AND SAY, "OH, IT'S FINISHED. ALL THE BATTLE SCARS, EVERYTHING YOU'VE been through." When Jesus walks in the room, that's when it's going to change. &gt;&gt; You think about it. He said that he would come by and wipe her tears and say, "It's finished." He said he even said the battle scars. You'd be sitting there at that table spread. You talking about a Thanksgiving. What a Thanksgiving feast that will be &gt;&gt; cuz you know what? I don't even want to eat. I just want to kneel at his feet for a thousand years and say, "Lord, I don't deserve to be here, but Lord, I just want to wash my wash your feet with my tears. I want to put some anointment on your feet. I want to feel the nail for N pill's hands. It's like uh Fanny CROSBY SAID, "HOW ARE YOU GOING TO KNOW ME? I'm not going to KNOW HIM BY MY SIGHT, but I'll know him by the nails in his hands." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; You might think, "Hey, Chris is just a little crazy this morning." No, I just love the Lord. &gt;&gt; I love this message more than I loved it 20 years ago. &gt;&gt; This is my life. I want to go down if I have to go in the grave. I want to live this to the day I die. &gt;&gt; Not a perfect life. I can't do that. But I have a perfect atonement. &gt;&gt; And you have a perfect atonement. WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, YOUNG PEOPLE, old people, HEY, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A MISTAKE. But you have a perfect atonement today. A ONCE FOR ALL. A once for all atonement. Aren't you glad that God don't go up to you and go, "Well, Brother Ber, let me see what you committed today." &gt;&gt; We were over in Israel. We went to Rome, Brother Joe, and we were sitting there, and I'm tell you what, we walked into the Vatican, and we walked over there, and these is confession booths all the way down. They're probably streaming it today. God bless you. And they they had they had it pull through here. They had all these these confession booths. And I thought, Lord, I just started to lift my hands. I said, 'Lord, I'd be just like them if it wasn't for the grace of God. &gt;&gt; I'd be saying it to some priest or something. But I'm here to tell you, bring it to the high priest today. &gt;&gt; Bring it to only one priest, the name of Jesus Christ. That's the only name above all names. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that he's came in your day and he's led the light? He gave you the entire book. He's opened the entire word. &gt;&gt; And it's not in vain. &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, my soul grieavves for the way that things go and I was driving down the road. I was tell I said my I was at this little concert and I said, "Lord, my my soul grieves." I was sitting there. I started crying. I said, "Lord, they can have this much fun with God, BUT WE SIT like this on Sunday and Wednesday. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I believe a message is so good. Brother Ber, &gt;&gt; I've been here for 40 years. God sent a prophet. You know, the devil knows that he sent him a prophet. &gt;&gt; The devil knows the word. The devil knows that brother Brandham, William Maron Brennham is a prophet in our day. But I'm here to tell you, do you know? Do you know it's SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE? IT'S NOT JUST TO SIT back and relax and just say, "Well, I'm just going to hang out. I believe a message." No, it's something that I provoke you today to get in the word. Let it become REAL IN YOUR LIFE. Let you become written epistles read of all men. &gt;&gt; I don't know that that's free. I ain't anything in my notes. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, I'm tired of seeing it. &gt;&gt; They worship the Lord. I'm just I was weeping. Brother Tom, I said, "Brother Ber," I was just weeping. I said, "Lord, if they can serve their God just like they can, how about me?" &gt;&gt; I literally thought in my heart, "HOW ABOUT ME?" WHEN THE ENTIRE BOOK, I GOT THE KEYS TO UNLOCK THE DOOR. YOU HAD the keys to unlock the door. But why do we walk through church, well, my back hurts. I'm just not going to make it to church today. I'm going to stream today. That sounds good. I'll stay in my pajamas. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; He might be my last service, but I still love every one of you. I love Brother Ber with all my heart. &gt;&gt; We get in my pajamas and I'll put them on. Get me a cup of coffee. &gt;&gt; I got a sniffle today. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Maybe I'm speaking to somebody. &gt;&gt; You know what? I feel like that the online streaming has bring us I love it. Praise God. When you really are sick and you need it, praise God. &gt;&gt; But when I got a sniffle, I get in the car. &gt;&gt; I wake up. I say, "Boys, the voice say, "Well, Dave, I'm not feeling good." Well, you better have a very high temperature or you you Let me tell you something. You better barely be walking. &gt;&gt; He He'll tell you, "You're getting in the car and going to church &gt;&gt; because as the Bible says, ask for me in my house. Ask for me in my house. We'll serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you know that SERVE PART, THAT PART that says serve, that's an action word. &gt;&gt; Did you know serve means do something? &gt;&gt; Not that I BELIEVE A MESSAGE AND THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; It means to do something for God. DON'T JUST HOLD IT TO YOURSELF. THERE MIGHT BE THE LAST SEED ON YOUR JOB. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE WAITING for you to introduce Jesus Christ to them. &gt;&gt; I think about the dentist. I think about the dentist. He looks at brother Billy one time and hope I'm saying okay. He looks at brother Benny. Billy sitting in there and he hands him the book. He says, "Why didn't you tell me about this? &gt;&gt; Lord, help me. Why didn't you tell me about this? This was your daddy. &gt;&gt; Never forget my dad looked at me one day. He said, "You believe the same stuff your grandmother preached." Believed. He said, "I I drove you church. I flew in every single state. I actually moved jobs everywhere I could, as far away from your grandmother as I could." Think about it today. Predestinated children. you are &gt;&gt; traveled the whole world in a plastic plant making millions and he would bring us the next house, the next house, the next house to North Carolina, Toledo, Ohio. I lived under a bridge. I ran away from home at a very young age. I'm here to tell you young people, I don't care how broke up your life is. &gt;&gt; I don't care how far you away from God. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to tell you, we have a gracious savior today that can bring you back home. If you're a prodal son, wherever you are, your children might be far away. I'm here to tell you, don't stop praying for them. Don't give up on them. &gt;&gt; But he would say, he looked at me, we've been getting married 20 years this coming year. And he looked at us in the five years of marriage and he walks up, he goes, "The very thing that I kept you away all my life, you and your brother went into." I started crying. I said, "Lord, Dad, why couldn't I get to it sooner? My life wouldn't have been so wrecked up." And I'm here to tell you, young people, it's not in vain. &gt;&gt; This message, young people, old people like, this message of what we got is not in vain. &gt;&gt; Don't take it for granted. &gt;&gt; As the musicians come, I'll finish up tonight. I want to read this quote. He said, "How's the gates going to open?" He said, "The button pressed and the pearly gate swung open. Here come Jesus led captive. Here he comes down as a conqueror walking down through the cities of new heavens." As they play something softly, the prophet of God says, "And he walked up in front of the father and he said, "Father, here they are. They all died under good faith." The prophet of God says, "Under the sacrifice of the lamb," he said, "but I present him to you." He said, "Well done." He said, 'Come up here and sit up right on my right hand, for I am going to send the Holy Ghost back down. It's not in vain, church. He goes on to say, "And you sit here until every enemy is made your foottool." He said, "Glory to God. We look for him to come again someday in glory." Listen to this. He said, "And those who are in the dust of the earth shall rise and be changed in the moment of twinkling an eye and be made like unto us." He said, "They shall possess the gates of the enemy." He says, "When they are all going to chop his head off like Paul, St. Paul, he said, "Death, where is your sting? Grave, where is your victory? But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ." He goes on to say, he says, "Oh, you think I'm a little crazy, don't you?" I say, "Praise God." He says, "But I'm sure feel good this way." He said, "Just don't let me alone. See how wonderful good some glorious day the last en last enemy I have, which is death, will be trampled under right under their feet. As with the conqueror, we shall march through the city." Oh, he says, "Today will be the harvest is on. Let's go. Listen to this. It don't say. He don't say, "Let's go. Just sit down." He said, "Let's go about gathering in the sheavs everywhere. Whatever God gives you to do, you're a little housewife. Testify to your neighbors or something. Do something. Bring somebody with you when you come." That's the message. That's an axe experience. That's something that God's saying, "Act out. Be your be the hands and feet of Jesus. It's not in vain." And you know what? One place he said, and I'm paraphrasing for time, one place he said he would attach a name when you get over there, he would you would have names attached to you. Oh, that humbles me. I don't not looking for some numbers or some big great numbers. I'm here to tell you, I just want to see one one more life dedicated for Christ. One more like to say I want it. I want more of them. With all heads bowed this morning, I feel like I've saved enough to save the whole church with the word of God that's went forth. Maybe there's one person in this entire place, no one looking around to say, "Hey, I want that. I want that, Lord. I want that real consecrated life on the inside. God bless you. God bless you. God sees you. No one looking around. Just say, "God," just be real with God. Say, "Lord, it's not in vain today. He sees your hands. He sees your life. God bless you." God bless you. &gt;&gt; Oh God, fill them, Lord. Fill them with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, Lord. God, if someone's sick today, whatever they need today, Lord, may you touch them. May you encourage them. Oh God, I know how life is. It's tolls and tears and trials, but you said they're for our good, Lord. Oh God, may you come in this place today in Jesus name. Oh, let's sing that song. When the saints are gathering in. I know it's kind of fast, but I like it. When the saints are gathering in for free from loss. Oh, come on. I will shout and I will sing when there Oh, put your name there. Oh, when the rain gathering wash my soul and victory. Oh, worship. I will shout. Come on. We'll see when the redee world. Oh, think about when the reading are gathering singing over when the rain gathering. Oh, sing it. When the rain got raining like snow. I will shout and I will sing the gathering. Well, then the Savior will give orders to prepare the banquet for when the redeemed are gathering in. All the angels all will listen for they cannot join that song. When the redeemed our gathering in Oh, when the redeemed our gathering in will wash and free from all sin. And I will shout and I will sing when the redeemed are gathering in once again. Oh when the redeemed are gathering in wash like snow and free from all sin. I will shout and I will sing when the redeemed are gathering in. Amen. Amen. Yes. Amen. Amen. I believe there's some redeemed here this morning. Don't you? Amen. Don't you love him this morning? Well, I love him better every day. Oh, yes. Oh, and I love him better every day. Oh, and close by. Well, I will abide. Oh, I love him better every day. Oh, and I love him better every day. Yes. Oh, and I love him better every day. Oh, and close by his side. Well, I will abide I love him better every day. Amen. You love him with all your heart. You have anything to say, Brother Thomas? Amen. I sure enjoyed that this morning, didn't you? Amen. And I also I I didn't uh tell you, but I appreciate you those that called and text and checked in on us while we were sick. And I just I don't ever want to not be thankful for your prayers because God's been good to me. I don't know about you, but he's been really good to me. Amen. Let's sing that as we go. If you're walking through shadow, God is good all the time. Let's sing a couple of verses and then you can be dismissed. Well, if you're walking through a valley, well, there are shadows all around. Well, do not fear. Well, he will guide you. Oh, he will keep you safe and sound. Oh, he has promised he'd never leave you nor forsake you. And his word is true. God is good all the time. He puts a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time and through the darkest night his light will shine. God is good. Oh, he's so good all the time. Well, we were sinners, so unworthy. Yet for us, he chose to die. He filled us with the Holy Spirit. Now we can stand and testify. Oh, that his love is never ending and his mercy, oh, they will never end. God is good. God bless you. You can go all the time. He puts a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good. all the time and through the darkest night.
