I just want to back up what I'm saying before I really get into it a Fool's mouth is his destruction and his lips are the snare of his soul Proverbs 18 21. death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof now job 6 and 24 he said teach me and I will hold my tongue and cause me to understand wherein I have aired isn't that powerful oh my and Proverbs 21 23 and it would be good if you memorized this this scripture Proverbs 21 23. whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from what troubles a bunch of troubles you know the law of of our land uh the officer when he you know he puts handcuffs on the man and he says uh he says you have the right to remain silent for the words you speak can and will be held against you in a court of law now before I go on into this further let's think about God's word God's word that is conceived I want you to really grasp this God's word that is conceived in your heart then formed by the Tongue and spoken out of your mouth becomes a creative Force releasing the ability of God within you and a message the church age book brother by Adam said when a spirit-born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart it takes it into his heart and he places it up on his lips while that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man or that woman because she's a part of man amen praise God hallelujah I'm feeling better already as one preacher said I think I preached myself under a better frame of mind and you know that is where the battle goes on up here in the top story of man that's where he kind of gets shaky up there like the Empire State Building yeah yeah we'll get into that a little bit but anyway Matthew 12 36 why don't we just read Matthew 12. that way you'll get you'll get it all Matthew 12 36. 37 . uh but I say unto you that Every Idle Word that man shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned so an Idle Word is is it's not a it's not an effective word it's just idle you know now let me give you an example of being Hung by the Tongue or the Rope getting tighter you see what I'm saying uh I want to give you some examples this lady one time she stood up in church and she said I want everybody here to pray for me because I am taking the flu now did you notice for Words yeah yeah she says I am taking the flu in other words the devil offered it to her he knocked on the door and she opened it up and said well come on in have a glass of tea amen uh and so uh a man I remember years ago you know you pick up a lot of things as your years go by but I I remember I was Uptown one cold day and I was walking up there and I said how you doing that partner he said well he's one of these guys that just you know leans up against the the building smokes a cigarette and watches the cars go by and I said how you doing our partner he said well I'm just trying to take the flu I thought man here I am trying not to take it I mean it was cold you know and here he is says well I'm just trying to take flu now I thought I thought about that I went on up the road thinking about that I don't know I never did forget it though and uh my mother told me something else that I never forgot too she said that uh she know this lady had two sisters that had died with cancer and she told my mother said you know I've been to the doctor and I'm perfectly healthy said but I'm waiting any day for the doctor to tell me that I've got cancer too because they had it well here we go James 3 6 and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature here it is amen and it is set on fire of hell think about that and in a message called the greatest battle ever fought brother Branham said listen it can better against you but it can't get to you until you accept it in the mind it's got to be first accepted in the mind the mind accepts it Eve stopped for a moment that's where Satan gets along people just just let me have just a moment and uh Satan walked right into that mine oh don't you stop for nothing you've got the message Jesus Lives God's a Healer that's the message don't stop for nothing no reasonings no nothing else Abraham never stopped for nothing for 25 years he confessed that God's word was true and he called those things which were not as though they were until the promise came to pass amen say how long do I have to keep saying it it's just keep saying it till you get better just say that that you are already better you're healed amen amen I've been believing God for several years for these fingers to get back to playing a guitar and I'm still believing amen I was kindly discouraged at one time sold all my guitars all my mandolins I saw and then God gave me enough courage to say hey fire straps I'm Healed I couldn't get that one finger down that far it was staying up there no I'm doing fine I'm Healed by Stripes I'm Healed I'm standing before you claiming my healing I've had all kind of healings take place in my life and I know you have too amen said don't stop for nothing and so an app till the promise came to pass or in second Corinthians 10 4 and 5 it says casting down imaginations our reasoning and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ so you got a job to do God is not going to push you through a pie bring you out the other side and say blessed is he that overcoming you didn't have nothing over a car you got to do something he said God ain't gonna push you to a pipe and bring you out the other side um it's getting a little deeper in it that's the last way down I just feel good tonight amen amen now we need to be careful about that don't you agree that we need to be more careful about our words how many would agree just stay let's just lift your hand do you need to be more careful I do okay sometimes now listen to this sometimes we're careful about our words like when we're in a funeral home or a hospital or a courtroom you better be careful or sometimes when a cop stops stops and then you kind of do you kind of put on the ACT and say oh I'm so sorry here's my license I'm so sorry sir please forgive me I didn't mean to do that they said well I'm gonna let you buy this time but you don't do that no more you hear me yes sir yes sir you say how do you know people do that because I've done it I'm so sorry sir see we're good actors you know when we want to put on act we connect well might as well tell the truth God knows it didn't say that amen but why should we just be careful at the funeral home or the hospital or when a cop stops us or when we're in a courtroom why should we just be careful then why shouldn't we be careful all the time about our words [Music] amen you know I want to tell you something and the message call is your life worthy of the Gospel brother Byron said Jesus was not fussy Jesus was not Stewie Jesus just spoke the words of God every word that come forth from his lips was God's anointed word he was our example he said wouldn't it be wonderful if we could say every word that I speak God honors it every word I speak he's blessed amen amen and I want to say now this may the the things I'm fixing to say now may seem a little bit funny but sometimes you know brother Brown said sometimes I'll say something to make people laugh make them cry and make it make them angry but I'm trying to contact their spirit okay so I just want to read you some things that tightens up the Rope a little bit tighter okay people say well I think I'm going crazy I think I'm losing my mind this is goes on every day people yeah you know I think I'm I think I'm getting the flu the news says it's going around and I might lose my job I'm oh here's another one I'm getting so old and I feel so bad and nobody knows what I have to go through with the kids make me nervous and I don't know how we're going to make it and my head is busting okay I'm unworthy why does everything happen to me here's another one just people I hope I make it well hope never did I kind of hope never did make it Bible hope is earnest expectation you believe God regardless of circumstances regardless what you see taste filled smell here regardless of imaginations conscience memory reason and affection you go way down into the soul that word that's the real you amen and that Soul loved to be fed soul food amen and we got it now I'll tell you what Let's do let's go to another scripture Matthew 6 31. I want to show you something there I want to show you how we thank it and then we speak it Matthew 6 31 and uh let's see here it's 31. therefore now this is Jesus therefore take no thought and watches watch what he said you notice that thought and saying or you first think it and then you speak it yeah Jesus he said therefore take no thoughts saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek uh for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you therefore take therefore no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient under the day is the evil thereof so uh how I want to whine kind of wine this thing towards I think we're like a halfway point here but anyway how do I keep from being Hung by the Tongue well let's say it like this God took a Stony heart out of you didn't he he put a heart of Flesh in you and then what did he do he put a new spirit in your new heart and then he come and lived in your new spirit because the spirit you had you couldn't even get along with yourself Amen brother Brown said the old soul dies are the old nature and the new nature is born within you and you're in a memorial is that right now how so what happens is God comes in here and takes up residence and he becomes the mainspring that's what I'm trying to say that's the mainspring like in a watch if you don't have a mainspring in it it's not going to keep time you look at it and say hey this thing something wrong with this thing well something's wrong with you see you got to have that mainspring you gotta have that token before you can take it over your your family and all you got to have it first and then the Soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the five senses of the flesh and then you're a different person all together now you know we all have our things that we go through every day like brother Brian said I have to repent every day of this and I have to repent I have to repent and he said and you have to too he says now as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but on the inside of you you are born again and Paul said I find in a law that when I would do good evil is present with me amen now let's go to do uh first Peter 3 10. first Peter 3 10 and and uh 11. for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue oh mercy from evil and his lips that they speak no gal let him assure evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it the eyes of the Lord are upon are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil okay now Psalms 39 1 says I said I will take heed to my ways that I sin not with my tongue I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me that would do you a lot good right there you know when people fuss at you and cuss you and all this yeah the Bible said be still and know that I'm God brother Brown said you can't do nothing to a child of God and get by with it you know what think about that let them go ahead say what they want to is that right now Psalms 19 14 let the words of my mouth now this was David's prayer and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight of the Lord my strength and my redeemer sometimes I don't know how to pray have you ever been that way and I'll just start with Matthew the first chapter and I'll say the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham Abraham beget Isaac Isaac beget Jacob and so on then I can think well what's some more scriptures brother Graham said just take those scriptures into your car and mine and repeat them how do you overcome this thing up here by taking the scriptures into your carnal mind and repeat them and what's he doing is generating power he's got to go when it's turning over and over like it is repeating it free all right now now Psalms 141 verse 3 said a watch O Lord before my mouth and keep the door of my lips Psalms 119 172 my tongue shall speak Thy word for all thy Commandments are righteousness I once read about a man that was in his 90s brother Thomas and uh they wanted to testify before the church and he said he said you can see that I've got all my hair and he said God showed me as a young man how to keep my heart and he said I got all my teeth and my vision and my strength and he said God showed me how to keep all that said one the first thing he taught me was how to keep my tongue and by keeping my tongue I could keep all the rest of it well it worked for him amen let's go back to proverbs proverbs 18. oh I just love the word don't you man proverbs I know it's in here I pray to God proverbs hmm well Proverbs 18 20. I'm not over here a man's belly a man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth that's the words that you speak you see and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled now you're going to be full of something that's right the prophet said you're going to be full of foolishness or you're going to be full of Pride are you going to be full of something why not be full of God [Music] amen now now I just want to show you something here a man's belly or his innermost being the real you shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth in other words the words you speak you speak God's word your own ear hears it you notice that when you speak it verbally out your ear hears it it goes down inside of you it comes back out next time bigger yeah and just like the man that went out and caught a 10 inch out he'd come back home and he was one of those fishermen had stretch the truth in other words he lied and uh he got talking about this trout and he said you know that was a 12 incher and he liked it he heard it and the next time he told that story he said oh it was a 14 incher well it kept on growing until finally it was 18 inches long he said sure enough it was 18 inches long see he heard what he was speaking and it sounded good to him I want to get something and that's the way gossip is if you hear gospel and don't repeat it it dies as far as you're concerned but if you repeat it one time you heard it you heard it and the next time it come out bigger and tonic got in this ear and that ear and out of here and that it was a lie usually sad in it I wrote a book on Gossip one time it was called uh what do AIDS and gossip have in common it's out of print now that I didn't make any money because I've never made any money I wrote three or four books I've never made anything I just wanted to do it but they're all out of print then I I made about 26 albums well I'm not I'm not bragging on God and I and I've never made anything the only money I ever made brother Thomas was when I was five years old let me go back to when I was there now and mother my mother she wanted me to sing so she sung and she wanted me to sing and she had company over at night and she said I want you to get up and sing for these people I said no I don't want to do that why I was afraid and that man that was the company he said I'll tell you what I'll do this was 1950 he said I tell you what I'll do he said if you'll just sang a little bit for me said I'll give you a nickel I thought about it and I thought about the candy store because that was a lot of money back then to me I said all right you got a deal and so I sung and I got we got my nickel buddy I was so happy it's the only money I ever made training but I ain't worried about money you know hey man God supplies my needs amen I usually I've sold seed eating cassette but I usually end up giving them away I mean once you use for them to let them lay around the house why not just give them away and you know God's blessed me for it and I didn't do it for a show I don't do things like that for a show I do it to be a blessing to God's children amen now I hope I'm not taking too long is can I can I say a little bit more tonight okay uh back years ago I several years ago when I was a boy growing up I had a a fear of swallowing when I've eaten I had a fear and I would try to eat and try to get it down without choking and it didn't bother me all the time but just once in a while it would hit me and I thought man and so I started studying on faith about these things and I spoke my own deliverance we was at the cat Morrison's Cafeteria and uh and it was when I was eating I just looked at my wife and I said I don't have that fear of swallowing any more and immediately it left me just like that now I ain't had it since you say did it come back and knock yeah but I didn't open the door I said no no thank you go somewhere else I don't want to who were you amen so my wrist hurt me for two solid weeks and I praised God for two solid weeks this was when I was painting houses you know and I'd get the high stuff she'd get the low because you know she dressed to dress amen and I think a lot of people in the message now thinks it's all right to to just uh dress this anyway that shows that that's a pitiful thing it shows they don't have a real true Revelation from God amen but so much for that anyway I praised God for two solid weeks off and on you know it just hurt me and finally after two weeks it quit hurting it went all the way amen praise the Lord amen and uh I remember when I I was I was working on the clock you know working punching the clock and I was making a living but I I really I really wasn't happy working on the third shift and oh man and so somebody promised me a paint job for 500 said and I'd have stepped out by faith I said I'll take it and I went to church that Saturday and I said I'm covered up with paint jobs I said I got more than I can ever do and you know about two weeks I was covered and slapped under people started finding out how good we painted you know and that we went in there and done a good job a neat job and cared for their furniture and all covered it up and taped off this and that and the other and I mean we we didn't have to go around advertising all you had to do was go into the neighborhood and paint one house that's it I got buddies I got friends they got relatives amen okay now I remember Sister Anne she had a knot on her hand one time and she said would you pray for it I said sure put a little bit of oil on it prayed a little prayer I forgot about it she forgot about it and we're the week's time that night they've been there for years was gone amen amen amen and uh I remember I was trying to teach my mother Faith one time and she was catching it pretty good and I happened to sneeze and I said no she said boy you just flatly refused that didn't you and that's it's kind of funny you know the way it happened and uh hey man let's go to James 1 26. I've got a few more things here chance 126. If any man among you seemed to be religious and broadleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain hmm let's read the other one pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their afflictions and to keep himself unspotted from the world Amen so uh blessings are transformed from the mouth and curses are too that's right that's scripture James 3 10. let's go over there James 3 10. out of the same mouth perceives blessing and cursing my bread and these things ought not so to be that's what he's talking about is not cussing he's talking about putting curses on people well you know they they've come up to the altar uh every time a new evangelist comes in they come up to Alder and they got re-saved again and you just watching David they've come to the altar but watch them give them two weeks and sure enough in two weeks they're back out there again well there was probably the problem uh the cause of it a lot of it because of the words are speaking against that person you got to be careful how you talking you don't got to be careful when you talk against brother Brown said you want this one talking about the thoughts of the pastor talking about the faults of this one talking about the faults of that one said if we would talk more about Jesus we would see more appearing of Jesus right and here here was Jesus in the bushes you know in those two disciples on the road to Emmaus and he was back there and they were just talking oh just oh man this Jesus we don't know what to do he come out and started walking with him he said what are y'all talking about I'll put it in today's language hey let me in on it they said don't you are you just a stranger here and you don't know what's happened and their eyes was blinded to Jesus and was blinded until he's done something inside when they got him inside and broke bread and give thanks their eyes were opened and he vanished out of their side but you see you notice now it was when they were talking about him that he appeared and he the prophet said that's our problem we just don't talk enough about Jesus here exactly amen well we're getting down to the last page and I really want you to really get into this and now okay you ready okay all right let's go to Ephesians now wait a minute uh yeah let's go to the fishing side yeah yeah y'all just making me so happy tonight amen praise God hallelujah Hallelujah ah Ephesians 5 18 and 19. and be not drunk with wine we're in his excess but be filled with the spirit now he's going to tell you how to be filled with the spirit brother Sean he's going to tell you right here in the next verse speaking what to yourselves you may talk to myself speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting yourselves one to another uh in the fear of the Lord fear of God Amen so we uh you know there was a they asked this kind of preacher one time said Moses why are you always talking to yourself he said well he said I likes to talk to a smart man and said I like to hear a smart man talk and then this preacher friend of mine he came over to where I used to work in Furniture he'd come over to where I was at we'd talk about the Lord and he said he said I was over there talking myself and about the Lord and they said preacher why are you always talking he said and he just finally bluntly said well I like to talk to somebody that's got some sense so there you go so we know who's got the sense that the Lord Jesus now we need to watch our tongue most people there's more people have been slain by the Tongue than by the sword amen the tongue is the most dangerous weapon in the world man thank you let's go to Isaiah 5 14 Isaiah 14. foreign 14 24 now this I really want you to really get a hold of this Isaiah 14 24. the Lord of hosts hath sworn saying surely as I have thought so shall it come to pass and as I have purposed so shall it stand now let's go back to Psalms 17. 3 and 4. psalm 17. thou has proved Mine Heart thou has visited me in the night thou has tried me and shalt find nothing I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress [Music] the word purpose means to come to a conclusion and have a made-up mind I want you to think about that let's say it together come to a conclusion and have a made-up mind because notice an experts concerning the works of men by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the past of the Destroyer you know what all we're saying tonight I think it's really powerful I think we need it now you can have what you say tonight good or I mean uh bad or good yeah I'm gonna put that on the left amen all right you know brother bam said the angel lord always comes to my right side you know after amen you know I was thinking about that one day Oral Roberts group come this way to be prayed for the band's come this way Billy Graham's come this way I thought well it may not mean nothing to you but it was just something in my heart that was the angel Lord had come to him not them that's true amen you can have what you say good or bad so don't become hung by the Tongue now uh I just want to read you something right here and and I'll try not to be too lengthy that there is a I found this that uh one of careers leading neurosurgeons said that the speech nerve center in the brain has total dominion over all your nerves the speech center and the Brain the speech center has such power over all the body that can simply by speaking can give one control over his own body to manipulate it in the way he wishes of course God knew that before the foundation world now if anyone says I have no ability I can't do the job I've never had nothing and I never will have nothing then right away all the nerves begin to declare the same thing yes they respond we received instructions from our central nervous system saying that we have no abilities and we are to give up striving to develop any potential capacity we must prepare ourselves to be part of an incapable person uh-huh someone says well I'm so very old and I'm tired and I can't do anything then right away the speech control center reacts by giving out orders to your nerves the effect the nervous responds yes you are old you see the nursing but yes you're old well you are ready for the grave [Laughter] let's be let's be ready to disintegrate so the nerve says because he has already spoken someone keeps saying he's old then that person is soon going to die once a man retires he keeps saying to himself I am retired then all the nerves start responding and they begin less act they begin to be less active as they as they prepare a quicker death man I want to stay busy doing something reading the word of God praying digging with a hoe or something yeah be busy exercise well I I'll get up in the morning I exercise drink me a protein shake and if I have to stand still and run I'll just stand still and run I mean sometimes it's raining like everything outside just walk through the house we do everything and then that you know the people say I'm not looking for anything to change the reason they haven't received the reverse instructions from their nervous system yet see remember the speech nerve center in the brain has total dominion over all the other nerves Therefore your body believes every word you say and response to it hmm if you want to change for the better change your language we can learn this new language from the best language book of all the Bible read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation hide God's word in your heart like the psalmist David said Thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against thee I learned that in the Army when I was 17 years old that was one of the scriptures I'd learned and one of the scriptures I Learned was Philippians 4 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me and my buddy that was he you know he was more spiritual than me and I was just a young baby Christian and I I was having it rough one day he said man and he was from up North you know and speaking that real though he says well here's here's what you got to do he says Hall here's what you got to do Philippians 4 13 said his way he said I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me he was speaking that Northern language you know I never did forget it I said yeah you're right that that's right and and he brought me out of that about every time he'd bring up that scripture amen okay just a little more here as you acquired a Bible language and speak God's word in faith you actually are feeding the central nervous system with a vocabulary a productive and Victorious words learn to speak those words and keep repeating them so that they will have complete control over your whole body praise God hallelujah amen well I got two more scriptures and they really need to be read okay let's go to Isaiah 57 19. you know I've tried to tell people that their problem was their tongue and they can't seem to get it foreign but I try anyway because I had a lot of problem with my tongue when I was growing up and I don't know why my my cousin he told my boy she said you just don't know your daddy said when he was a boy he was mean as the devil I thought man how could he say that about me because I wasn't that mean but one of my Center buddies said man why don't you quit cussing like you do said you know I wasn't living for God he said what is people going to think about you I said do I cuss like you he said you sure do I say oh but I didn't realize it I didn't realize it and uh uh I remember hitchhiking to California when I was 16 I was going to see my uncle out there and go to work with him in construction and I wasn't living for the Lord and I could I was stuck in Texas brother Thomas I was stuck I could not get a ride and a storm was coming up and I began to bargain with God and I seen an 18-wheeler coming and I said God if you will let that truck stop and pick me up I said I promise you I'll quit cussing and I'll go to church and I'll be a good boy I see I was bargaining with god well the truck did stop and as when I got in the door it started raining and when I got inside the door boom it all come down and I woke up and I said can I get up here in the bed and sleep he said get up there so I woke up to Albuquerque New Mexico and he was he'd give me his bed he was down there sleeping in the seat he'd give me his bed and when I got to California my uncle had moved back to Seattle Washington and you know what happened to me don't you I broke my promise I was going to go out there brother Thomas and surprise him and say here I am I'm ready to go to work in your big construction company and he surprised me I went to the cops and I said Hey where's my uncle at he said oh he moved us back to Seattle about two weeks ago I said oh no oh man so they put me in a foster home and I had a mom and daddy for about you know three months I said I want to go back home so they sent me back anyway that wasn't our message but anyway yeah it was too so Isaiah 57 19. notice how he says this I create the fruit of the lips now this is God speaking through Isaiah I promise you I'm gonna let you out in about 10 minutes and I'm not going to be like some preachers that says I'll let you out in 10 minutes and I'll let they let you out in two hours angle do you like it I was in a I was in a convention one time and the preacher got up and he said now look if you go to sleep don't worry about it when you wake up I'll still be preaching okay okay Isaiah 57 19 this is God saying I create the fruit of the lips in other words I bring to pass what people talk about peace peace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith the Lord and I will heal him God is saying I bring to pass what you talk about one more scripture Psalms 34. I'm not going to say I hope you're getting anything out of this tonight I'm going to say I believe you are that would be the right words wouldn't it brother Thomas 34 1-4 I will bless the Lord every once in a while no I didn't say that I Will Bless The Lord when I'm feeling good all times well when when the children spread and the rents paid and everything no he said I Will Bless The Lord at all times I will pray uh his praise shall continually be in my mouth God didn't give you a mouth just to eat with he'll give you a mouth that you could fill it full over the word of God how can you do it by reading it you're eating the word of God when you read the prophet of God said you ought to read one chapter a day of course I end up reading more now at times don't you yeah okay here we go my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear there of and be glad o magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears praise God perfect love casteth out fear this message came to cast out the fear foreign amen in closing tonight I remember I had a pinched nerve where I'd looked up as much painting no it really got next paralyzed just about paralyzed me down through here and I was in misery and I'd still try to work anyway if I'd get tired I'd lay in the van rest my neck a while go back to work and I had numbness in this finger she's two fingers and years later it was still there and I was going to preach for a brother I looked over at sister and I said you know this numbness in my hand I said I don't have it no more in Jesus Christ's name and it immediately left me that just goes to show you how powerful your words yeah when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith now brother Bob said man
