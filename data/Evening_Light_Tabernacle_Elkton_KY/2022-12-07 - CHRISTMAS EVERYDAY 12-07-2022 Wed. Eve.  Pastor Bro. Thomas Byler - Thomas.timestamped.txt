[33:35] Luke 2
[33:37] .
[33:48] and we'll read verse 8 through 13. and
[33:52] there were in the same country abiding
[33:55] in the field keeping watch over their
[33:57] flock by night and lo the angels of the
[33:59] Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the
[34:01] Lord Shone round about them and they
[34:03] were so afraid and the angel said unto
[34:06] them fear not for behold I bring you
[34:08] good tidings of great joy which shall be
[34:11] to all people for unto you is Born This
[34:13] Day in the city of David a savior which
[34:15] is Christ the lord and this shall be a
[34:18] sign unto you you shall find a babe
[34:20] wrapped in swaddling cloth laying in the
[34:22] manger and suddenly there was with Angel
[34:26] a multitude of the Heavenly hosts
[34:29] praising God and saying glory to God in
[34:32] the highest and on Earth and on Earth
[34:34] peace and Good Will towards men may God
[34:37] add His blessings to the reading of the
[34:39] word you can be seated I want to title
[34:41] this and I this is just what come to me
[34:43] and meant there's two different titles I
[34:46] thought about it given that one was
[34:47] Christmas 24 7. amen Christmas 24 7.
[34:52] amen but I will title it Christmas every
[34:55] day how's that sound amen and so you
[35:00] know
[35:01] and I say every day because I believe
[35:04] that as we approach this season and you
[35:07] know it's a season that uh uh according
[35:10] to their song you know to have a song
[35:12] something that says you know tis the
[35:15] season to be jolly
[35:17] right amen and so it's the season to be
[35:21] jolly everybody wants to be happy around
[35:23] Christmas they say It's the Most
[35:25] Wonderful Time of the Year
[35:28] foreign
[35:31] Christian every day it's the most
[35:34] wonderful time
[35:36] amen it isn't just you know they call it
[35:38] the spirit of Christmas
[35:40] right now and it reminds me of what
[35:43] brother bam said on Mother's Day and
[35:45] everybody know goes and does things for
[35:47] Mom you know on a certain day bring her
[35:48] flowers amen I just got a pool to quote
[35:51] up he said that man says 365 days a beer
[35:54] it should always be Mother's Day
[35:58] not just a certain time and a certain
[36:00] day but it should always be and I think
[36:02] that of eyes to Christmas don't you
[36:04] because they want to just make it one
[36:06] day of the year that they all want to be
[36:08] jolly
[36:10] amen they all want to be happy you know
[36:14] and that's not the way it ought to be I
[36:16] believe for Christianity things amen
[36:19] it's every day and let me tell you
[36:21] something if we truly preach Christmas
[36:23] message it isn't just Christmas that's
[36:25] why I wasn't worried about whether it is
[36:26] close to Christmas or not
[36:29] because we preach Christmas all year
[36:31] round
[36:33] how did the Lord came how Christ came
[36:35] from the heavens of Heavens to save
[36:37] mankind isn't that right
[36:39] and you know I had
[36:41] the thing
[36:42] this week that you know there's so many
[36:45] promised time
[36:47] in so many things that's totally
[36:50] self-lifted
[36:55] coming up a lot of our problems are
[36:57] self-inflicted
[36:59] because I mean those Christ came to take
[37:01] care of all of the problems here and
[37:03] take care of us and give us the things
[37:05] that we have need of and a lot of times
[37:07] people don't have joy they don't have
[37:09] peace
[37:11] uh
[37:13] I like that I like this first thing that
[37:16] he says he says you know he says I bring
[37:19] you good tidings of great sorrow
[37:23] sadness and I just tried to picture when
[37:27] I talked when I looked at that word Joy
[37:29] of Tidings of great joke oh amen we sing
[37:32] the Tidings of Comfort and Joy
[37:36] outlasting about the Rams today and he
[37:38] was preaching on God cares do you care
[37:40] and I'd love to go into the detail
[37:42] because he went into great detail and
[37:44] talking about it in the heart of man God
[37:46] has put an empty place in there a
[37:48] certain place amen that calls you to
[37:52] help and desire to want to have comfort
[37:57] two and a half Joy you got that thirst
[37:59] and everybody puts it in the wrong thing
[38:01] but God made you to want to have joy to
[38:04] want to have comfort and we know that
[38:06] the world goes to great extents to have
[38:09] a little Joy
[38:11] to be happy
[38:14] huh
[38:17] can I just say what comes to this gray
[38:19] matter of mine
[38:21] I'm coming in some people are just happy
[38:23] being sad
[38:25] they're sad so much until they've just
[38:27] accepted it and they just stay sad
[38:32] I hear a few amens you must have known
[38:34] somebody like that too right you can't
[38:36] cheer somebody up if you try it with
[38:38] anything you got why because they
[38:39] probably tried to be happy you know
[38:41] never it just didn't work
[38:43] and I like the one thing about this and
[38:46] tonight's message is that every day
[38:48] every day should be Christmas you know
[38:51] we have a problem as human beings we
[38:53] have a problem with consistency
[39:00] you know and I thought about it got into
[39:02] deep thought about this and I thought
[39:03] about you know God made it that way to
[39:05] where man God God's shaped this thing
[39:07] and I'm not sure what the brother man
[39:09] have called it the law of average I
[39:12] guess or something
[39:13] our law of contrast
[39:16] all right you got the days you got the
[39:18] nights you got the good times you got
[39:19] the bad times you know and the law of
[39:21] contrast you have everything has a
[39:23] contrast here
[39:24] there's the good days there's the bad
[39:26] days we feel good we feel bad
[39:29] we have good things happening we're
[39:31] happy we're at bad things happen we're
[39:33] up we're down we're in and we're out
[39:36] we're not consistent we're human beings
[39:38] and he made God made it that way why in
[39:41] order for you to be consistent for one
[39:44] thing we know that it takes Christ no
[39:46] right for any person not the for a
[39:51] person to be at a place where brother
[39:53] bam said I think it's been normal now he
[39:55] says you know the one thing about him is
[39:56] he's always the same amen
[39:59] let me tell you something how many knows
[40:01] it takes a lot it takes us that's fat
[40:04] that's that's so when you can say that
[40:06] about somebody that they're always the
[40:08] same
[40:11] because we aren't that way
[40:13] huh
[40:16] if we if we allow we can be more that
[40:19] how many wants to be more that way
[40:21] but you know what we allow uh you know
[40:23] the law of contrasting affect us we know
[40:26] we're gonna you know we're gonna have
[40:27] happiness we're gonna have joy one day
[40:29] the next day we're not gonna have any
[40:30] Joy
[40:32] I know we're gonna be up we're gonna be
[40:34] down we're going to be in we're going to
[40:35] be out inconsistent
[40:37] just like in the weather
[40:40] or like the seasons
[40:43] amen
[40:46] I believe reference to this in the
[40:48] interview talking about some people you
[40:50] know and you're kind of like the weather
[40:52] you know sometimes you have cloudy days
[40:54] they have gloomy days they have sunshiny
[40:57] day
[41:00] but what did he say he said and I don't
[41:02] have the board here everybody talks
[41:03] about you know it's a person that lives
[41:05] on the outside realm perhaps in the
[41:07] Justified state or even in the
[41:09] Sanctified State you know they're still
[41:11] uh subject to the weather out there
[41:15] that's the way a lot of Christians are a
[41:17] lot of so-called Christians let me tell
[41:18] you the whole world and you know the sad
[41:21] part about it is and we're seeing let me
[41:23] just say this kind of off the thought
[41:25] but we're seeing the evidence of how
[41:27] Wicked the world is because now they're
[41:30] they don't want nothing to do with
[41:31] Christmas at all anymore
[41:34] they don't want no Christmas they don't
[41:35] want to Christ they you know first they
[41:37] took an Xmas right who's the Xmas and
[41:39] now they don't want Christmas to you
[41:41] know my
[41:43] it's fast sliding isn't it
[41:45] you know because used to people man
[41:47] Everybody celebrate not everybody
[41:48] anymore it's getting worse and worse
[41:51] you know we the thing the other thing
[41:53] that I want to say is you know the wise
[41:54] men came at a certain time and they
[41:56] lived today their gifts amen down there
[41:59] before Christ and gave gave gifts you
[42:01] know and we give each other gifts and so
[42:03] forth and then what they worshiped him
[42:05] didn't it and I think that's the type of
[42:07] us you know the best thing that we have
[42:09] to not want to just say you know what we
[42:11] want to do is we want to not just give
[42:13] him a gift once a year we want to give
[42:16] him a gift every day what if do we give
[42:18] the greatest gift that you can give is
[42:20] yourself
[42:23] amen you've got to give him that gift
[42:26] every day because how many knows you're
[42:27] gonna die to yourself every day every
[42:30] day you got to recommit yourself to God
[42:31] say Here I Am Lord
[42:36] I was reading a corporator man says you
[42:38] know what uh at Easter you know he said
[42:40] he said about himself he said he'd wish
[42:42] everybody Merry Christmas
[42:45] and Easter because you wouldn't see him
[42:47] anymore till Christmas
[42:49] now he either used to work so pathetic
[42:52] or something like that how terrible it
[42:54] is
[42:54] that some people are so irregular about
[42:57] even honoring God they'll only come at
[42:59] Christmas or at Easter or something like
[43:01] that that's real sad folks
[43:04] very inconsistent
[43:07] so I want to tell you something that for
[43:08] us Christmas is every day
[43:11] amen not only that but
[43:14] I don't know if I'll preach another one
[43:16] but you know
[43:17] uh you know we could talk about the
[43:20] rejected King isn't that right how that
[43:22] Christ is rejected them and the gift is
[43:25] rejected amen
[43:28] but mine so we want that full benefits
[43:30] aren't you glad that we received the
[43:32] minute great Good Tidings of great joy
[43:35] which shall be to all the people amen
[43:39] hallelujahs
[43:41] so we don't want to be like the weather
[43:42] folks we want to be consistent we have a
[43:44] God that never I'm glad that you serve
[43:47] God that is
[43:48] never up and down never in and out
[43:53] if he was boy I'll tell you what will
[43:55] you and I be in trouble if he'd just
[43:57] come and help us if we he felt like it
[44:00] well I don't feel like it today don't
[44:03] bother me I'm in a bad mood
[44:09] but isn't that how we do well I don't
[44:10] feel like praying so I guess oh I don't
[44:12] feel like going to church I guess I
[44:14] won't
[44:15] come on you're not right I don't feel
[44:17] like that you know hey come on if we if
[44:20] you come by your feelings am I
[44:22] we all learn we know that if you go
[44:24] about your family you are sure they're
[44:26] going to be tossed about
[44:28] no you gotta be further than that you
[44:30] got to be yielded to Christ more than
[44:32] that
[44:36] amen I've got one quote tonight can I
[44:40] read it
[44:41] it's one that I've preached so many
[44:42] times and I like it
[44:43] was where brother Branham
[44:46] uh
[44:48] we're in his bed and preached to his
[44:50] wife till about 12 o'clock he says
[44:51] talking about a text come on his heart
[44:53] about rest and so forth she raised up by
[44:56] Grace listen to me and I said a
[44:58] Christian's faith is based solidly upon
[45:00] rest that's right a Christian isn't
[45:02] tossed about it Christian doesn't run
[45:04] from place to place
[45:08] come on people how many knows everybody
[45:11] out there I hope somebody runs from
[45:13] place to places listening tonight
[45:16] I heard somebody
[45:18] I'm damn hoping somebody that's tossed
[45:19] about how many knows that even if
[45:22] Ephesians 4 says you know that we should
[45:24] be no more talk s about with the wind
[45:26] and every slide and so forth
[45:29] not be children anymore
[45:31] no not toss but if I have more
[45:34] Ministries to make you solid to get you
[45:36] on the anchor where you won't move
[45:40] oh my
[45:43] how beautiful it is to know people
[45:46] that are
[45:49] resting
[45:51] man
[45:54] friend if I can do one thing as your
[45:56] pastor is get you into rest
[45:59] I thought about this and I want to speak
[46:01] on this for just a minute because this
[46:02] is another day another day that uh
[46:05] people used to think that on a certain
[46:07] day on a Sabbath day that's the day of
[46:09] rest
[46:10] amen until even The Seventh-Day
[46:12] Adventist Mandel they'll make anything
[46:14] outside of that the Antichrist
[46:16] the only way that we gotta get back to
[46:19] rest on the seventh day well Paul
[46:21] clearly made a statement he says you
[46:23] know blew it right out of the water
[46:24] don't let any man judge you in meat or
[46:25] drink or any holy day or any Sabbath day
[46:28] and he made it very clear that he says
[46:30] you know we have entered into rights
[46:32] those of you who are in Christ have
[46:34] entered into rest
[46:37] amen and he has those who have entered
[46:39] into heaven his rest have ceased from
[46:42] their own works
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:47] how many knows if I can get you to cease
[46:50] from your own work and I can get you to
[46:52] rest in Christ then you are gonna be one
[46:55] happy one peaceful person
[47:01] I can tell you but I can't put you in
[47:04] there
[47:06] you got to get in there
[47:08] you got to get in that place of rest
[47:09] it's not a certain day Christmas isn't a
[47:12] certain day the rest isn't a certain day
[47:14] Mufflers say isn't a certain day it's
[47:17] every day
[47:19] Joy To The World Isn't it one day it's
[47:23] not around it's every day
[47:25] you could have joy the world could have
[47:28] joy if they'd receive the joy that God
[47:30] came to give isn't that why isn't that
[47:33] something that the first Proclamation
[47:35] was that they're bringing Tidings of
[47:38] great joy
[47:43] be something if we could put it on
[47:46] listen to the Holy Ghost
[47:48] hey man you got free from their sins it
[47:51] would show them to run in the house he'd
[47:53] show them running over abuse they show
[47:54] them screaming and hollering
[47:57] wow
[47:58] oh you have the biggest bunch of
[48:00] screaming hollering down through history
[48:01] you ever heard
[48:08] not little Joy great guy
[48:14] because I'll tell you what if you get
[48:16] the full benefits of what he come for
[48:19] that man in that cradle that man he's
[48:21] not in the Cradle anymore but every day
[48:23] he's in the Cradle of my heart
[48:26] aren't you glad not just one day not
[48:29] just Christmas we don't have him in that
[48:30] cradle he's in this cradle
[48:33] foreign
[48:37] I worship him every day every hour of
[48:39] every day 24 7.
[48:41] [Music]
[48:44] Hallelujah
[48:48] great joy where is that Joy
[48:52] what brings that Joy why would he give
[48:55] such great joy I'll tell you why because
[48:57] Jesus when he began to preach he went
[48:59] into the synagogue and that was
[49:00] delivered unto him the book of the I
[49:02] prophet Isaiah and then he opened the
[49:04] book he found the place where it is
[49:05] written
[49:07] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[49:09] because he has anointed me to preach the
[49:11] gospel to the poor
[49:14] and how many knows you know we're all
[49:16] just poor people
[49:19] maybe not you know you might not only
[49:21] Paul if you might not be he might have
[49:23] been Rich enough but he was spiritually
[49:25] poor you and I were spiritually poor we
[49:28] didn't know which way to turn but he
[49:29] came to those who had need of him
[49:32] to preach to the poor
[49:34] and he said to heal the brokenhearted
[49:38] amen
[49:40] and to preach Deliverance to the
[49:43] captives
[49:45] I mean no sin had you captive
[49:49] it held you all had a hold of you when a
[49:52] person gets liberated did you ever get
[49:55] to see a person again
[49:56] liberated a person that amen and breaks
[50:00] through the sound barrier amen and lets
[50:02] God come take his sins away
[50:04] they act the fool sometime but they
[50:07] can't help it why because there's such
[50:09] Overjoyed to be relieved of the change
[50:11] to find them
[50:14] you're a captain of your hell but the
[50:16] grace of God the blood of Jesus Christ
[50:18] breaks those chains
[50:20] [Music]
[50:22] amen now you have joy every day brother
[50:25] bam says you know amen people want to he
[50:27] says you know I drank just as much as I
[50:29] wanna drink I've been drunk for the last
[50:31] 40 years ever since I got saved amen I
[50:33] drink more the Holy Ghost big boy
[50:40] I have found his grace is all complete
[50:45] he supplies they really oh it is joy
[50:50] unspeakable and full of grace amen
[50:54] oh peace that passes understanding
[50:57] oh that's what it's all about Tidings of
[51:00] great joy peace on Earth and Good Will
[51:03] towards men
[51:07] praise be to God
[51:09] we don't celebrate him in the manger
[51:11] anymore except for the manger of our
[51:13] heart
[51:16] I reminded you ought to get up to thank
[51:20] you Lord for being in the manger of my
[51:24] heart I'm here to praise you
[51:27] hey man I've had a sore foot
[51:30] hey man the old Devil's trying to give
[51:32] me a sore foot it was better
[51:34] so yesterday morning I was out in the
[51:36] garage listening to gospel music and I'm

[51:41] it I had me a good old dance with it
[51:44] ah dance nah dance nah dance nah dance I
[51:48] quit and then I got to dance to another

[52:09] my why because he's in the manger
[52:13] of your heart
[52:14] Hallelujah
[52:16] every day
[52:18] we celebrate we worship him like the
[52:20] wise men give the gift of yourself not
[52:22] just one year amen or not just
[52:25] on the 12th day of Christmas my true
[52:27] love gave to me
[52:29] I wanted to try to find the lyrics of
[52:31] that you know he'd have the 12 Days of
[52:33] Christmas
[52:35] I want you to know we've got
[52:37] 356 is it 356.
[52:42] 365.
[52:43] thank you very much
[52:45] 365 days a year
[52:49] hey man so I know you're gonna have to
[52:50] come up with a whole lot more to sing
[52:52] about
[52:53] and I'm sure that you could have one for
[52:55] each one if you thought about what God
[52:56] does for you every day
[52:59] amen
[53:02] every day 24 7.
[53:06] Hallelujah
[53:08] we enjoy
[53:09] the benefits of Christmas
[53:11] now notice I want to talk to you a
[53:13] little bit about another something else
[53:15] and that is
[53:17] what we humans do
[53:21] all right
[53:22] us humans first of all
[53:24] we can be outside of Christ we can be so
[53:27] inconsistent
[53:28] so up and down
[53:31] not every day is the same
[53:34] huh
[53:35] and we do have trials we have doe things
[53:38] but if you're really Anchored In Christ
[53:40] as brother bam talked about that ship
[53:42] that he saw in the harbor no matter if
[53:44] the waves come over go under go around
[53:47] you can't sink because you're anchored
[53:50] amen
[53:52] let's make sure you're anchored
[53:55] the second thought that I want to bring
[53:56] was humans
[53:58] have a
[54:00] unique ability to take the right thing
[54:04] and mess it up
[54:09] we can mess some stuff up now
[54:13] huh
[54:15] that's right even Brother Brad says you
[54:17] know the idea of Christmas is all right
[54:19] but it's all this other stuff
[54:21] that you can't teach your children
[54:23] because if you do and you don't tell
[54:24] them that it's not really real
[54:26] they're going to say when you get older
[54:28] Oh you mean you're telling me to turn
[54:29] the closet isn't real well is Jesus the
[54:31] same way
[54:33] remember
[54:34] but there's a truth
[54:36] see that's the truth in Christmas
[54:39] we drove through the little
[54:41] drive-through over in Lewisburg the
[54:43] other night me and Mike and Grayson our
[54:46] family there and they had demand you'd
[54:48] had all the different scenes and I
[54:49] thought man you know I don't have a
[54:52] problem with that we should celebrate we
[54:54] should make a big deal of God coming
[54:57] down to you to man you know it's right
[55:00] there
[55:01] but the problem is is the Old Saint Nick
[55:06] uh it's the Santa Claus let's open the
[55:09] North Pole and got all these little
[55:11] elves working for him
[55:14] huh
[55:16] and then he's got the slay and he's got
[55:18] the reindeers even Rudolph the Red-nosed
[55:22] one
[55:25] we made all these extra stuff to this
[55:27] isn't that right
[55:29] now all becomes a big commercial
[55:32] that's what brother Ryan didn't like
[55:34] about all of that
[55:35] amen
[55:37] the commercialized World got a hold of
[55:39] not only of that but also of Easter
[55:42] isn't that right
[55:43] Easter egg hunts and bunny rabbits
[55:46] what's that got to do with the
[55:47] resurrection of the Lord Brother Brandon
[55:49] said
[55:50] all right
[55:51] [Applause]
[55:53] every time we come to church it'd be
[55:55] Sunday we come and honor the
[55:56] resurrection isn't that right we ought
[55:59] to honor the resurrection every day 24 7
[56:02] honor the resurrection
[56:06] how many knows there's not a holy day
[56:08] anymore that's the holy ghost that is in
[56:10] you You Are Holy every day
[56:15] amen
[56:17] praise be to God but we have a way of
[56:19] messing things up the human race does
[56:21] whether it's Christmas or whether it's
[56:24] Easter
[56:25] or whether it's the Bible
[56:29] huh
[56:30] we get our own ideas put into it
[56:34] and guess SWAT according to the Amish
[56:37] years the Bible tells you you got to be
[56:40] driving a horse and buggy
[56:43] you may be wearing these black clothes
[56:46] huh
[56:48] they gotta believe they believe that if
[56:49] you you I flaw Hellbound most of them
[56:52] where I come from
[56:54] to be told
[56:55] it means you're high
[56:58] or English
[56:59] they call it hi ho
[57:02] I'm not sure why hi but anyway I'm not
[57:04] high
[57:06] but anyway did you think that people in
[57:08] the world lost
[57:10] huh well I would hope that they think
[57:13] they were right wouldn't you
[57:15] because if they thought they weren't
[57:16] right they couldn't really do what
[57:18] they're doing now could they
[57:19] and that goes not just for them but for
[57:21] the men and I
[57:23] huh and then those that have steel
[57:25] wheels and those are rubber tires the
[57:27] mom and Mennonite the beachy homage
[57:29] there's so many different classes
[57:32] what a mess
[57:34] right
[57:37] people's got different conceptions of
[57:39] the lord of the coming Lord and every
[57:41] one of those churches healthy that's how
[57:43] I should be that's what the Bible was
[57:44] trying to tell us
[57:47] I hope this goes out and I wish every
[57:50] Amish Mennonite and every other person
[57:51] would hear this but God God come down in
[57:54] this generation and he prove what was
[57:56] right and what was wrong
[57:58] God did I didn't God did
[58:01] the prophet didn't God did it through
[58:03] the prophet
[58:05] because he couldn't have done anything
[58:06] without God
[58:07] it was God doing it and it'll meet this
[58:10] whole generation on the day of judgment
[58:12] that in the midst of all that Darkness
[58:15] God brought a great Shining Light
[58:17] even as Jesus said the Bible talks about
[58:20] there's a light that is sprung up for
[58:21] the Gentiles or for the for the Israel
[58:24] and so forth and that a light that is
[58:26] sprung up
[58:27] but we have a way of making a mess of it
[58:31] because the fact is every Mennonite
[58:33] every Army sent me Baptist every
[58:35] Pentecostal every one of them we all are
[58:38] to all be together
[58:41] huh
[58:43] why aren't we
[58:45] because of our own ideas that gets in
[58:48] the way
[58:50] amen
[58:51] every message believer ought to be
[58:54] together
[58:55] but some ideas get in the way
[58:58] amen
[58:59] people's ideas people's ways
[59:03] amen
[59:04] Lord help us
[59:08] I just want him to have the manger of my
[59:11] heart
[59:12] don't you
[59:13] I want him to have Supreme control every
[59:16] day with Jesus is sweeter than the day
[59:19] before
[59:20] every day with Jesus I love him more and
[59:23] more
[59:25] amen
[59:27] why because of what he done
[59:29] listen to preach Deliverance to the
[59:33] captives
[59:34] the recovering of the sight to the blind
[59:38] amen I mean no that's not
[59:41] just physically
[59:43] but not spiritually
[59:46] folks I'm here to tell you if you are in
[59:48] a blind denomination if your blood it
[59:50] takes God to open your eyes
[59:53] yeah it takes God to open your eyes to
[59:56] the word of God to even make God real to
[59:58] you
[1:00:00] there ain't a preach in the world can do
[1:00:02] it for you he can preach the word but it
[1:00:05] has to be God coming on your end of it
[1:00:08] that person's end of it and quickening
[1:00:12] amen
[1:00:13] folks I have preached some of the
[1:00:15] horriblest message I ever preached I
[1:00:17] thought
[1:00:18] huh
[1:00:19] and one person comes to say brother
[1:00:21] probably you don't know that's just what
[1:00:22] I needed
[1:00:24] foreign
[1:00:25] you don't know sometimes preachers
[1:00:27] sometimes the Lord will keep you down
[1:00:29] it cause you to say a certain thing that
[1:00:31] a certain person needs
[1:00:33] you never know amen
[1:00:36] certain person
[1:00:38] but I like points everybody gets
[1:00:39] something don't you
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:43] one thing more I want to say
[1:00:46] that is about
[1:00:48] our feelings and our emotions you know
[1:00:51] God made it to where we're Rocky we're
[1:00:54] wavy if you're not in Christ isn't that
[1:00:57] right he made it to where in order for
[1:00:59] you to even as a Christian it meant to
[1:01:01] be solid every day what does it take it
[1:01:04] takes discipline don't it it takes takes
[1:01:07] discipline on your part
[1:01:10] to pray and to make room for him amen
[1:01:13] you know that's another thing that they
[1:01:15] didn't have amen they didn't have any
[1:01:17] room for him in the end
[1:01:19] that's the way it is in our day that the
[1:01:21] world a lot of people they've got no
[1:01:23] room for him
[1:01:25] I'm at least that you and I we make room
[1:01:28] for him every day
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:33] reason people might cause you God is
[1:01:35] because they don't make room for more of
[1:01:37] God if you want more of God you've got
[1:01:39] to make more room that's why I said
[1:01:41] Sunday and you aren't happy where you
[1:01:43] are you're gonna have to do something
[1:01:45] different
[1:01:47] you're gonna have to do something
[1:01:49] different in your daily life you cannot
[1:01:52] get going doing the same thing and
[1:01:54] expect different results it's not going
[1:01:56] to happen
[1:01:58] now I guarantee you if you want to get
[1:02:00] closer to God begin to pray and say God
[1:02:02] help me to understand and show me how to
[1:02:04] get closer to you
[1:02:08] oh my but we wear ourselves out a lot of
[1:02:11] times for the physical on the for the
[1:02:13] Flesh and we don't have any time
[1:02:15] for God there's no room but for you and
[1:02:18] I
[1:02:19] there's more room how do you say tonight
[1:02:20] Lord I'm making room
[1:02:22] I'm making room for you Lord

[1:02:52] know that
[1:02:54] amen

[1:02:58] for him in the end
[1:03:00] the main thing also is you know
[1:03:03] Christmas is
[1:03:05] they call it the Christmas spirit right
[1:03:07] it's a spirit of joy and happiness and
[1:03:10] love isn't it
[1:03:12] a spirit of happiness and joy
[1:03:15] but yet I've been told that more people
[1:03:17] commit suicide around Christmas than any
[1:03:20] other time
[1:03:25] because you know how many people are
[1:03:27] left out there without being without
[1:03:30] togetherness and without that love and
[1:03:32] all of that and they get it's the bluest
[1:03:34] time
