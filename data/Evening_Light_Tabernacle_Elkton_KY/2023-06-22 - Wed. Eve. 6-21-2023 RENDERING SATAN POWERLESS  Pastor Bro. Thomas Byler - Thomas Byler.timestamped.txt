[30:36] Wednesday night so you can be seated for
[30:37] a minute we have uh amen a praise report
[30:40] amen this evening and so we just want to
[30:43] share that with the help of Lord sister
[30:45] Sherry I believe has some news for us
[30:47] and we're gonna just let her speak amen
[30:50] praise the Lord God bless you Sister
[30:52] Sherry
[31:00] a verse that really kind of touched me
[31:01] and it says and it uh
[31:04] I gotta find it again
[31:07] um
[31:08] and God I will praise his word and God I
[31:11] have put my trust I will not flesh can
[31:14] do unto me
[31:15] that's because I've been trusting God
[31:17] through all this and some of you know
[31:18] the story some of you may not all know
[31:20] all of it but I'll try to be brief I
[31:23] started out with going to the hospital
[31:24] and finding out I had a mess
[31:27] on near my Cola colon in the back of my
[31:30] colon it was only mass and I'm told it's
[31:32] no cancer don't worry about it it
[31:34] doesn't it can't be cancer because it
[31:36] doesn't doesn't act like cancer
[31:38] so I'm thinking okay well good thank you
[31:40] Lord I'm not I don't have cancer this is
[31:41] great but I will find out what's wrong
[31:43] so I go to a doctor who I'm sent to
[31:46] and he says well it's a big Mass it's
[31:49] about the size of a saw ball and
[31:52] um but I don't think it really looks
[31:53] like cancer but it could be so he sends
[31:55] me into an oncologist who then sends me
[31:58] to an oncology surgeon
[32:01] the surgeon I have had test taken he
[32:04] looks at it and he says you've got
[32:06] cancer okay thank you Lord I'm I'll
[32:08] praise you anyway because I know nothing
[32:10] happens unless you allow it
[32:12] and so
[32:14] why go and then I finally get to the
[32:16] point he says well I'm going to take it
[32:17] to a board and see if there's something
[32:18] we can do for you
[32:20] so he never calls me back but my own
[32:22] oncologist doctor called him and she
[32:25] says well he said there's nothing more
[32:26] that they can do
[32:28] um and it uh nothing was going to help
[32:30] and that I'm just going to have five to
[32:32] ten years and be happy with it
[32:33] so I said okay Lord that's what you want
[32:36] I'm going to continue to praise you now
[32:38] please understand I'm human so uh Satan
[32:42] really gets into my mind every once in a
[32:43] while and tried to tell me see he didn't
[32:45] love you or he would have healed you and
[32:47] I'm thinking Lord that's not true and I
[32:48] said Satan get out of here I don't need
[32:50] that kind of negativity because I know
[32:52] I'm in God's hand and God's going to
[32:54] take care that's right amen so as of
[32:57] last Sunday there was nothing going to
[32:59] be done
[33:00] so I said okay I'll just live with it
[33:03] it's Monday morning I got a call from my
[33:05] oncology doctor or doctor not the
[33:07] surgeon and she said she took it to her
[33:09] board and they said that there is a pill
[33:12] or a shot that I might be able to take
[33:14] that even though it's a slow moving
[33:16] cancer I've had 15 to 20 years that they
[33:20] might be able to slow it down even more
[33:23] and they hoping to get it so slow that
[33:25] it doesn't grow anymore and if that
[33:26] happens then they'll give me a chemo
[33:28] pill to help get rid of it and then a
[33:31] radiation to make sure there's nothing
[33:33] else going now this is a long process
[33:35] that's not going to happen forever and I
[33:37] can remember over and over again God's
[33:39] telling me be patient be patient it's in
[33:41] his time not my time but I want to thank
[33:44] everybody for your prayers I want to
[33:46] thank you and ask you that please
[33:48] continue to pray that I can keep strong
[33:49] because the strength's not mine it's
[33:51] God's believe me I'm human and I could
[33:54] cry and be sorry for it and say well how
[33:56] could this happen to me
[33:58] but I know that God's in control he's
[34:00] not only in control of me but he's in
[34:02] control of the world but he's in he's in
[34:03] control of me right now and I'm trusting
[34:06] him and that's I'm just happy that now
[34:08] that they have something to find
[34:10] don't maybe help me they said there's no
[34:12] guarantees but there's always a
[34:14] guarantee with God
[34:16] so thank you guys for your prayers and
[34:18] your continued prayers
[34:21] [Applause]

[36:38] with the thought that I was going with I
[36:41] thought about a message about the

[36:48] message out and I just began to scroll
[36:51] down didn't listen to it but let's look
[36:52] at the whole thing and as I begin down
[36:54] going down through there not only that
[36:56] one but many different scriptures that I
[36:58] had thought about but especially that
[36:59] one was right in there amen that's where
[37:02] I found it so I says well Lord I believe
[37:03] that's just you amen amen so amen may
[37:07] God bless you tonight if you will turn
[37:09] your Bibles this evening and we'll go I
[37:12] think we'll start with uh
[37:15] um
[37:15] Revelations let's go all the way to the
[37:18] Book of Revelations we realize that the
[37:20] hour and the day is coming when actually
[37:23] Satan will be put in a pit isn't that
[37:26] right
[37:27] and he will not be able to do any more
[37:30] damage at all amen and we want to look
[37:33] at that and then read over in the New
[37:35] Testament something different that
[37:36] relates to it not in the New Testament
[37:39] but in the Book of Matthew I believe it
[37:41] is 18. Matthew 20
[37:43] verse 1. and I saw an angel come down
[37:46] from heaven having the key of the
[37:49] bottomless pit and a great chain
[37:52] in his hand and he laid hold on the
[37:55] dragon that old serpent which is the
[37:57] devil and Satan and bound him a thou am
[38:01] a thousand years and cast him into the
[38:04] bottomless pit and shut him up and said
[38:06] to seal upon him that he should deceive
[38:09] the Nations no longer till the Thousand
[38:11] Years should be filled fulfilled and
[38:14] after that he must be loosed amen a
[38:17] little season may God has blessings to
[38:19] the reading of the words you can be
[38:20] seated
[38:22] I hadn't really thought about this but I
[38:24] want to talk about three different
[38:25] things as we begin I mean if you'll
[38:28] notice he said talks about having the
[38:30] key of the bottomless pit amen and all I
[38:33] didn't premeditate this one but you know
[38:36] when we think about a key to the
[38:37] bottomless pit and and and and and and
[38:39] Satan get uh thrown into a pit and
[38:43] locked up and I believe the prophet of
[38:44] God said one place he says you know till
[38:46] he'll be put into a place a chain of
[38:51] circumstances a chain of circumstances
[38:54] because he said he won't have anybody to
[38:57] work through anymore
[39:00] hey man he had nobody to work through I
[39:03] mean they all know that the devil has to
[39:05] have somebody or something and there's a
[39:07] lot of things folks that if you're not
[39:10] under the blood and not under the Holy
[39:11] Spirit there's a lot of things the devil
[39:13] has to work on
[39:16] amen so we see that key we also think
[39:19] about how that Christ when he uh sends
[39:21] it into hell we've been given the
[39:23] demonstration and the scripture says
[39:24] that he said when he ascended on high
[39:27] and so forth when he read it wrote in
[39:29] the Book of Revelation she says I have
[39:31] the keys
[39:32] of hell and that isn't that right so
[39:35] Satan I mean Jesus went to hell so to
[39:38] speak and took those keys from the Devil
[39:41] isn't that right how many remembers
[39:44] another place Jesus said to Peter he
[39:45] says I give you the keys to the kingdom
[39:49] amen this this is the one I believe I
[39:52] wanted to read amen and it's found in
[39:54] Matthew 18. we'll read that one because
[39:57] this is right on the area where I wanted
[40:00] to and Miss speaking now I'm mentioning
[40:03] it but I want to read it in Matthew 18
[40:06] Matthew 18 and 18 I believe it is
[40:10] amen
[40:13] um
[40:14] he says it this way to Peter he says
[40:17] verily verily I say unto you that
[40:20] whatsoever ye shall bind on Earth shall
[40:24] be bound in heaven amen
[40:27] and whatsoever he shall lose on Earth
[40:29] shall be loosed on in heaven and I say
[40:33] unto you that if two or if
[40:35] two of you agree on Earth as touching
[40:39] anything it should and that each day
[40:43] shall ask it shall be done unto them of
[40:45] My Father which is in heaven praise the
[40:49] Lord so we see there that we're given
[40:52] the power to bind how many believe that
[40:56] that we are given the power to bind the
[41:00] enemy Amen in other words we're giving
[41:03] given the power to cast The Devil out
[41:05] amen
[41:06] amen tonight with the help of the Lord
[41:09] with the help of the Lord amen when we
[41:11] talk about rendering the past the devil
[41:13] powerless and how that how that the real
[41:16] believer has uh been called to
[41:20] demonstrate the power according to First
[41:23] Corinthians there Paul said I'd rather
[41:25] until when I came to you came not with
[41:27] Excellency of speech or of wisdom
[41:29] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[41:31] for I am determined not to know anything
[41:34] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[41:38] crucified amen
[41:40] so there's a reason that Paul really
[41:42] didn't want to know a whole lot more
[41:44] than just tell me about his crucifixion
[41:46] tell me about what Christ did
[41:50] amen because how many knows and he
[41:54] and Brad Van preached a message on
[41:56] um uh that day on Calvary and what it
[41:59] really meant because we know that
[42:00] mankind was bound we were we were Bound
[42:04] by the devil how many we were in Fetters
[42:06] of chains of sin that we couldn't get
[42:09] away from
[42:12] we were not free
[42:15] we were bound
[42:17] amen but how many beliefs tonight we're
[42:20] free
[42:21] I mean because of the Cross and so now
[42:24] notice I want to go down to uh verse 4
[42:27] and my speech and my preaching was not
[42:29] with enticing words of man's Wisdom but
[42:31] in demonstration and of power another
[42:35] place Paul said amen when we preach to
[42:37] you the gospel it did not come in word
[42:39] only but in power and demonstration of
[42:43] the Holy Ghost
[42:45] tonight I want to define or perhaps get
[42:47] a little bit more detail about what the
[42:49] power amen what did what it really does
[42:52] what the power and demonstration really
[42:55] is
[42:56] and how it affects us on a personal
[42:58] level
[42:59] amen
[43:01] Hallelujah
[43:03] and I want to say tonight that you know
[43:05] uh
[43:07] Christ when he came he did something so
[43:10] much more than just uh what Israel
[43:12] wanted him to do and that was we'll bow
[43:15] at this time again restore the Kingdom
[43:17] of Israel amen he was coming to do in
[43:20] such a so so great there a purpose amen
[43:24] and we all know we all know what the
[43:26] public God said about how that Jesus
[43:28] Christ on Calvary how did he strip the
[43:30] devil of any power that he had
[43:34] any Authority he absolutely stripped him
[43:37] from amen that's what amen Christ did on
[43:40] Calvary now I want to go to uh
[43:44] Ephesians actually I'm just going to
[43:47] read a quote at this time before we go
[43:49] to the not Ephesians but we go into here
[43:51] brother Bannerman preaching on that day
[43:54] on Calvary I mean now it seems whether
[43:56] bam says he says that it would be a
[43:59] little out of season it this should be
[44:02] preached on Good Friday
[44:04] man but better man says Calvary should
[44:08] be remembered every day
[44:12] amenities that goes along with what Paul
[44:14] said isn't that right amen I really come
[44:17] to you and all I want to know about is
[44:19] Jesus Christ amen if what he did amen
[44:23] amen this should be good now notice that
[44:25] every day and we've heard so much about
[44:27] it read so much about it preachers has
[44:30] preached on it since the beginning of
[44:32] time singers have sang it Through the
[44:34] Ages prophets foretold at 4 000 years
[44:37] before it ever happened and the prophets
[44:40] of this they point back to when it did
[44:42] happen
[44:43] it's so it's such an important day amen
[44:47] it's one of the most important days of
[44:50] all days that God ever let Dawn on the
[44:54] Earth
[44:59] oh my I get a I get a little rebound
[45:03] from that
[45:04] I get I get a little noise from the oil
[45:08] isn't that right why do I get noise from
[45:10] y'all why do I hear an amen or praise
[45:12] the Lord why because you have an
[45:16] experience of what that name is
[45:20] we'd all be quiet in here amen if we
[45:23] didn't speak if I didn't speak from
[45:25] experience to you and preach to you from
[45:28] experience that that day meant something
[45:31] so much for me
[45:36] perfect
[45:37] it changed the whole and oh my let me
[45:40] just say it this way the Bible says the
[45:42] Rocks read the Earth shook the sun went
[45:44] down in the middle of the day didn't it
[45:46] was so dark you could feel it the whole
[45:49] earth it was such a great thing until
[45:51] the old Earth had a prostrations on the
[45:54] feet and just shut down it was such an
[45:56] awesome day
[45:57] amen
[46:00] my because God had did something
[46:02] something happened that changed the
[46:05] course of the world course of history
[46:09] amen praise the Lord let's look at the
[46:12] importance of that day the importance of
[46:14] Calvary but we know that it was only
[46:17] through Calvary that the devil can ever
[46:20] be rendered powerless
[46:23] we see in our day in our age all around
[46:26] us we see people that are absolutely
[46:28] Bound by the devil
[46:32] they do what their feelings are what
[46:34] their emotions are what their Spirits
[46:36] are what their nature is isn't that
[46:39] right
[46:39] amen and it's governed by the devil and
[46:42] I'll tell you what it behooves us to
[46:44] make sure that the devil doesn't have
[46:46] any power over us
[46:49] he has no grip on us
[46:55] because how many believe that we can be
[46:57] absolutely free of his grip
[47:01] we don't have to come under him in no
[47:03] fashion or form I'm told through the
[47:05] prophet of God that if you're part of
[47:06] the body amen because he can't he
[47:08] overcome every devil
[47:10] he overcome everything when he was here
[47:13] on Earth
[47:14] he came overcoming Matthew 5 when he was
[47:16] tempted by lust he was attempted by
[47:18] Pride he was tempted by power and all of
[47:21] the things the devil offered him all the
[47:23] kingdoms he said I do with him but I
[47:25] want to
[47:27] he's seen America he see all the
[47:29] kingdoms he's offered them all but he
[47:30] overcome he overcome Legion and all of
[47:33] those devils
[47:36] amen everything he overcome everything
[47:39] and then when he gives you of himself
[47:41] and when you become part of Jesus is
[47:44] Christ I don't care if you feel like
[47:46] you're just a doormat or you're just a
[47:48] soul under the foot and then I'll tell
[47:50] you what if you nothing but the heel of
[47:52] the foot in the body every devil is
[47:54] still under your control he is still
[47:57] under you
[47:59] but only if you're in the body of Christ
[48:02] that's the only way otherwise he's gonna
[48:05] make you put on another tattoo he's
[48:07] gonna make you run after this as I run
[48:09] after that
[48:10] desire
[48:14] ain't no telling what he'll have you
[48:16] looking like just look around and you'll
[48:18] see what the devil gets people looking
[48:20] like just look around and you'll see how
[48:22] perverted amen and transgender and
[48:24] everything else that you're doing
[48:26] absolutely senseless the poor girls that
[48:29] can't have any sports because our
[48:31] leaders ain't got pain enough to know
[48:33] that you don't put a man up against the
[48:35] woman he has got much brains
[48:40] they might as well quit any sports
[48:42] because the man's gonna come and I don't
[48:44] care what it is a man's gonna outdo a
[48:45] woman
[48:49] huh
[48:52] that's the devil that's what the devil
[48:55] does
[48:56] all of this chaos and mess that you see
[48:59] out there that's the devil doing that
[49:01] [Music]
[49:03] you hardly have anybody even that says
[49:05] anything against it if you do they'll
[49:07] boycott you
[49:14] amen
[49:15] oh my but only through Calgary how many
[49:19] flat for that day on Calvary amen let's
[49:23] talk about something brother Brandon had
[49:25] three different things that he wanted to
[49:26] talk about amen when he talked about
[49:28] that day on Calvary first you went
[49:29] through and how that rehab amen our sins
[49:32] were gonna be erased how did they were
[49:34] going to be forgiven amen
[49:36] and how that we're going to be
[49:37] reconciled to almighty God now that
[49:39] there was a pardon for his children
[49:42] because I'll tell you how many knows
[49:43] that if God don't forgive you of your
[49:45] sins you should
[49:46] you're gonna be guilty you're still
[49:48] gonna be in anguish you're still gonna
[49:50] be feel horrible feel terrible

[49:57] wash away my sin nothing but the blood
[49:59] nothing but oh precious is the flow that
[50:03] makes me white as snow
[50:05] oh my
[50:06] praise the Lord so let's just go through
[50:08] this
[50:09] Hallelujah now notice I think it's good
[50:12] for us to go back
[50:14] it was the most important day to the
[50:16] human race Calvary was I think it's good
[50:18] for us to go back and examine to see
[50:19] what it means to us I'm sure that in
[50:22] this late hour that we're living in
[50:23] we're seeking very important we are
[50:26] seeking very important uh the very
[50:28] importance of God that we can know every
[50:30] importance of God that we can know and
[50:32] all that we can find out amen we are
[50:36] here to learn it to see what is for us
[50:40] and what God has done for us remember
[50:43] when Jesus died he said it is finished
[50:49] in other words he did everything he
[50:51] could do
[50:53] he paid the price
[50:56] now it's up to people to accept
[50:58] whosoever will let him come
[51:02] now it's up to the people of what they
[51:04] do with it
[51:06] it's done our healing is paid for it's
[51:10] done already our Salvation is done your
[51:13] forgiveness
[51:14] I don't care if you pop
[51:16] well I don't care if you're a murderer I
[51:18] don't care you're the thief on the cross
[51:20] amen when you accept that part and it's
[51:23] over with
[51:26] you can be as happy as a child as free
[51:30] as a child as innocent as a child
[51:34] how many is left for that
[51:37] amen the most important day
[51:39] Calvary if you're ever going to overcome
[51:42] the devil you better go look back at
[51:45] Calvary amen
[51:49] praise the Lord what I got wrote down
[51:51] something about here we have to find out
[51:53] exactly what it's going to take what is
[51:56] it going to take to render Satan
[51:59] powerless
[52:01] amen ah it just comes to me remember the
[52:03] one scripture about church age book you
[52:06] know if if the bride the church gets a
[52:07] real revelation of who what the devil is
[52:10] amen who she is and what she stands for
[52:13] and that she can do to Greater Works
[52:16] amen she begin to discern and withstand
[52:19] the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[52:22] powerless
[52:24] before her
[52:25] isn't that how you want him I want the
[52:28] devil powerless
[52:31] he will put you a frown on your face
[52:33] like you ain't never said it'll drag the
[52:37] floor
[52:39] the devil make you sad depressed
[52:43] make life not worth living make you
[52:46] suicidal oh it's just terrible terrible
[52:49] terrible Jesus comes to give you joy
[52:52] unspeakable and full of Glory
[52:56] that's what Christ come that you might
[52:58] have life not even
[53:00] I have it more abundantly amen
[53:04] that's what he said to Jesus said the
[53:06] thief comes not but to kill to steal and
[53:08] to destroy that's all the devil is he
[53:11] goes about like roaring lying seeking
[53:13] whom he can devour
[53:16] amen
[53:17] praise the Lord now notice and I'll just
[53:19] add this in here I like this quote
[53:24] all that we can find out learn about see
[53:26] what's for us see what Christ has done
[53:28] for us see what he promised to do for us
[53:30] that's what we come to church for that's
[53:32] why preacher preaches
[53:34] that's why he studies and meditates the
[53:37] scriptures I was doing that and I said
[53:39] boy that is good for me six for
[53:42] inspiration is because he is a public
[53:45] servant of God to God's people and he's
[53:48] trying to find something that God would
[53:50] have
[53:51] to say to his people something that
[53:54] would help them
[53:56] amen
[53:57] oh my maybe it would be to condemn them
[54:01] of their sins but would be a help to
[54:03] raise them up
[54:05] oh my preacher he'll preach on sin he'll
[54:08] preach on all everything that's wrong
[54:10] but he'll also give you a way out
[54:13] tell you how to overcome that and how to
[54:15] better yourself we're here to better
[54:16] ourselves not worsen ourselves amen
[54:21] raise him up then they might forsake
[54:23] their sins and to raise up to serve the
[54:25] Lord a minister should seek those things
[54:29] praise the Lord
[54:31] you better bam on the day of Calvary one
[54:33] thing he got into was you know how that
[54:35] people are totally unsatisfied
[54:39] dissatisfied people
[54:42] he says that's the reason many times
[54:43] today that a sinner is still wandering
[54:46] about
[54:47] reminds me of the scripture says you
[54:49] know is there no bomb in Gilead is there
[54:52] no physician there
[54:55] how many of these guys oh this is a
[54:57] doctor's office this is the hospital you
[55:01] have come to the right place
[55:04] amen maybe an ambulance didn't train you
[55:07] here but whoever brought you here you
[55:09] are here amen and there's a medicine
[55:11] here that can help you
[55:14] that can heal you
[55:18] but brother bam said he says so many
[55:19] people will come to the doorstep but
[55:21] they won't even go into the office
[55:23] doctor says come on in let me diagnose
[55:25] you they'll even get diagnosed and
[55:27] everything
[55:28] the doctor will hand them the medicine
[55:30] say take it
[55:32] but they won't take it will they get
[55:34] well done now your people will sit and
[55:36] defuse it and die
[55:39] because they don't take the medicine
[55:42] they don't take the inoculation that God
[55:44] made on Calvary
[55:46] Hallelujah I was 20 years old when I
[55:49] took that inoculation I'm 60 something
[55:51] now and I'm telling you it still holds
[55:55] it's still good it's good for a lifetime
[55:58] it'll be good for eternity
[56:01] does something to you
[56:05] mother Peter
[56:08] but if I told you there's inoculation
[56:10] now after a couple of days it kind of
[56:12] wears off
[56:15] you know after a year or two you just
[56:17] don't feel the inoculation anymore it
[56:19] doesn't work anymore
[56:22] that's not right you disagree with that
[56:26] [Laughter]
[56:29] I disagree with that this inoculation
[56:32] don't wear off
[56:33] this inoculation if anything it gets
[56:36] better with time
[56:39] it gets better
[56:42] oh Mark can I just preach
[56:44] listen it's kind of like wine they said
[56:46] you like that old one it gets better
[56:48] with time well I'm telling you what
[56:50] Amanda my long Great Ghost the more real
[56:53] it is
[56:55] the more you're a Christian the longer
[56:57] you are and you realize God takes you
[56:58] from this from that
[57:00] and it carries you through
[57:02] amen the better it gets
[57:06] it doesn't lose its power
[57:09] the blood blood of Jesus Christ shall
[57:11] never lose its power till all the ransom
[57:14] Church of God be saved to send more
[57:18] amen so got the saving power
[57:21] folks Peter preached them on the day of
[57:24] Pentecost and three thousand Souls were
[57:26] saved isn't that right he went to the
[57:28] house of Cornelius preached the gospel
[57:29] and while he was still preaching the
[57:31] Holy Ghost fell on him
[57:33] let me tell you something how many
[57:34] beliefs tonight that same thing Can
[57:36] Happen by the preaching and the
[57:38] foolishness the preaching amen people
[57:39] are saved

[58:04] know the reason that many times the
[58:05] sinner was still wondering about he said

[1:00:16] amen but still they did me find that
[1:00:19] wandering about through the world
[1:00:21] finally one day that's that day at
[1:00:24] Calvary there was one that came from
[1:00:26] Glory by the name of Jesus Christ the
[1:00:28] son of God who came from glory and
[1:00:31] Calvary was formed
[1:00:34] that was the day that the price was paid
[1:00:36] the sin question was settled forever and
[1:00:38] it up opened up a way unto you
[1:00:41] that we're hungering and thirsting for
[1:00:44] and it brought a place of satisfaction

[1:01:09] you'll never be satisfied
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:13] no man that's ever come and visited
[1:01:16] Calvary and see in the way that it was
[1:01:18] can ever be the same everything that he
[1:01:20] ever desired I like this quote
[1:01:22] everything that he ever desired or long
[1:01:24] for is met when he reaches that place
[1:01:29] Hallelujah
[1:01:30] aren't you glad that there's a place
[1:01:32] amen that you can go that can absolutely
[1:01:34] fill that long and that's in your heart
[1:01:36] feel that desire that's in your heart
[1:01:39] tell that void that's in there
[1:01:44] the crazy stuff that people will do for
[1:01:47] happiness
[1:01:49] and it never makes him happy
[1:01:52] they never get happiness
[1:01:54] they never get true Joy
[1:01:56] because there's only one place that
[1:01:59] you'll find it and it's because of what
[1:02:01] Jesus did
[1:02:03] on Calvary
[1:02:05] amen
[1:02:07] praise the Lord
[1:02:09] amen
[1:02:10] everything that you ever long or desired
[1:02:14] for was meant if you'll get to that
[1:02:16] place

[1:02:20] important that it shook the world it
[1:02:22] shook the world like it was never shook
[1:02:24] before when Jesus died and paid the sin
[1:02:27] question this sinful world had a
[1:02:30] blackout the sun went down in the middle
[1:02:31] of the day it had a nervous prostration
[1:02:33] the Rocks shook the mountains ran the
[1:02:36] red dead bodies bursted for us from the
[1:02:38] cave and what did it do God zeroed in on
[1:02:42] Calvary he wounded that animal called
[1:02:45] Satan forever
[1:02:49] amen he wounded him forever
[1:02:53] now he's been more vicious than ever
[1:02:57] because it brought light to the human
[1:02:59] race
[1:03:01] can we say it brought Joe to the human
[1:03:03] race it brought peace to the human race
[1:03:06] it brought Victory to the human race it
[1:03:08] brought Redemption to the human race it
[1:03:11] brought reconciliation to the human race
[1:03:13] what Adam lost we we got restored back
[1:03:16] oh let me say it again and again and
[1:03:19] again and again amen what Adam Moss has
[1:03:22] been restored back
[1:03:24] we have been restored back to fellowship
[1:03:26] because of it
[1:03:29] we are no longer bound by the devil
[1:03:33] to have to be rocking around sad
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:37] and blue and depressed because I'll tell
[1:03:41] you this just having to work and having
[1:03:43] jobs having to meet this requirement
[1:03:45] that requirement and having this go
[1:03:48] wrong and that go wrong and more go
[1:03:49] wrong it goes right
[1:03:51] causes us to have Allah who face
[1:03:56] are you with me that's why we have long
[1:03:59] faiths we'd all be a lot happier
[1:04:01] if we didn't have all of this if we were
[1:04:03] in God's civilization
[1:04:07] hey we're going to fellowship and
[1:04:08] worship to mourning and guess what
[1:04:10] tomorrow morning we're going to get up
[1:04:11] and go lay before the Lamb of God and
[1:04:14] worship him for a while and then we're
[1:04:15] going to go and then
[1:04:19] we but here we are all bad
[1:04:24] that's right I care so many times choke
[1:04:27] us
[1:04:28] but I believe it says it sometimes it
[1:04:30] even chokes out people amen
[1:04:32] people's spiritual life gets choked out
[1:04:35] because of the cares of life
[1:04:38] why do you think that Paul he didn't
[1:04:39] have a whole lot of ties to the world
[1:04:42] no he didn't have a whole lot he just go
[1:04:44] from place to place even the early
[1:04:46] church sold the houses and everything
[1:04:48] and you know didn't have a place to go
[1:04:51] one man one time set the Holy Ghost he
[1:04:53] said made a mistake you made a mistake
[1:04:55] didn't have didn't do that but yet he
[1:04:57] said the brother man says God don't make
[1:04:59] mistake the Holy Ghost didn't make
[1:05:00] mistakes
[1:05:01] they went and spread the gospel
[1:05:03] everywhere then
[1:05:04] amen
[1:05:06] all right let's go on praise the Lord
[1:05:09] you love him it
[1:05:10] wounded that animal oh he is an animal
[1:05:15] like a
[1:05:19] roof hour
[1:05:22] folks I'm telling you the devil will
[1:05:25] destroy your life
[1:05:27] he will destroy you
[1:05:31] the only thing that holds you together
[1:05:33] is God
[1:05:37] look at it look at the decision that's
[1:05:40] taken
[1:05:42] I was thinking you know this is just
[1:05:44] kind of on the side
[1:05:46] the way that God meant it for it to be
[1:05:48] he meant for us to
[1:05:50] for young people to get married to find
[1:05:52] you a husband to find your wife to raise
[1:05:55] children isn't that right that's the way
[1:05:57] God meant to do and then for you to
[1:05:59] raise him in such a way that they when
[1:06:01] one of these days you're going to go off
[1:06:03] the scene but you need to have something
[1:06:04] decent for them how many knows it man
[1:06:07] who'd even want to raise kids hardly
[1:06:09] nowadays
[1:06:10] you probably should if you still have
[1:06:12] are you married no but it's harder
[1:06:14] because you're like Ma I'm gonna have to
[1:06:15] raise him in this you better keep a
[1:06:17] Title reign on him hello
[1:06:19] but that's where it was meant to be for
[1:06:21] us to think about our children and their
[1:06:23] children but is our government thinking
[1:06:25] about that no did you think about their
[1:06:27] selfish selves
[1:06:30] destroy the family unit
[1:06:32] you destroyed a family unit you destroy
[1:06:34] your nation you destroy your
[1:06:37] neighborhood
[1:06:40] and boy they are destroying our kids
[1:06:43] before they ever even get out of school
[1:06:47] they don't stand a chance they're going
[1:06:49] to have warped Minds before the evenings
[1:06:51] come out
[1:06:52] amen let me tell you something it's no
[1:06:55] wonder
[1:06:56] that they're they're in the mental state
[1:06:59] that they are
[1:07:01] you think they're happy no they're not
[1:07:02] happy
[1:07:04] let me go on
[1:07:06] this
[1:07:10] now notice now he's been more vicious
[1:07:14] since then because it brought light to
[1:07:16] the human race anyone knows it that
[1:07:18] wounded animal is more vicious
[1:07:21] isn't that right crawling around with
[1:07:24] his back broke
[1:07:27] you don't think he was more vicious
[1:07:29] since then
[1:07:30] how about the 68 million Christians that
[1:07:34] Satan slaughtered down through the Dark
[1:07:36] Ages
[1:07:37] it was vicious
[1:07:40] burn them at the stake feed him the
[1:07:42] Lions have people all up in that
[1:07:45] Auditorium or in that Coliseum man just
[1:07:48] packed out and and watching them kill
[1:07:50] each other yeah
[1:07:52] yeah and then they're just feasting on
[1:07:53] blood the people were as bad as their
[1:07:56] leader was to love to watch somebody
[1:07:58] have to die Christians to get killed
[1:08:03] vicious
[1:08:04] Satan is a vicious
[1:08:07] amen
[1:08:09] look at what we got going on our crime
[1:08:12] rate our murder rate
[1:08:14] people killing each other
[1:08:16] amen criminals that kill others in the
[1:08:19] courtroom have no uh remorse whatsoever
[1:08:24] an animal vicious that's what the devil
[1:08:27] is that's not God
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:31] all right now notice Satan was knocked
[1:08:34] out at Calvary the Earth proved that it
[1:08:37] was the greatest price that was ever
[1:08:39] prayed paid and the only one that could
[1:08:41] pay it how many knows nobody could ever
[1:08:43] pay it nobody else could and that's why
[1:08:45] God made it that way
[1:08:46] now notice when the doctor gives a man
[1:08:48] an anesthesia he knocks him out before
[1:08:51] he can do any before he can do it and
[1:08:54] what when God gave an operation for the
[1:08:56] church The World God of anesthesia and
[1:08:59] nature had a convulsion so to speak no
[1:09:01] wonder God in human flesh was dying it
[1:09:04] was the hour that the world had looked
[1:09:06] for yet many of them did not know it
[1:09:09] look at it look at it today Jesus Christ
[1:09:12] come and proved himself alive the way
[1:09:14] that he did an RNA
[1:09:16] Discerning your thoughts and intents of
[1:09:18] the heart raising The Healing The Sick
[1:09:20] by the millions did the very same thing
[1:09:22] and people still don't recognize it
[1:09:24] look at it today many look for these
[1:09:26] things and yet they don't recognize him
[1:09:28] they don't realize the way out they're
[1:09:30] still trying to seek pleasures and
[1:09:33] things of the world trying to find their
[1:09:37] way out
[1:09:38] isn't it something don't you just want
[1:09:41] to have a voice to say hey World hey
[1:09:43] everybody there is a way out
[1:09:46] there is a way for you to have joy for
[1:09:48] you to be happy for you to be free for
[1:09:51] you to have peace of mind when you lay
[1:09:52] down in your bed
[1:09:55] there is a way all you got to do is
[1:09:57] accept it and receive it
[1:10:00] it's what we have heard for for the last
[1:10:01] two thousand years the great wonderful
[1:10:04] story of Jesus coming to the Earth
[1:10:06] amen praise the Lord
[1:10:09] notice that day it was a death blow to
[1:10:12] Satan's power it ended everything oh I
[1:10:16] can see him there he was this he was
[1:10:19] Eden's lamb Christ was Eden's lamb from
[1:10:22] the very first shadow that come you know
[1:10:25] that he cometh when Able by faith
[1:10:27] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:10:29] sacrifice than Cain he must have tied a
[1:10:33] grapevine around the Lamb's neck
[1:10:36] huh how many knows Abel had a revelation
[1:10:39] that there was going to be a lamb come
[1:10:41] and it was going to be slain for his
[1:10:43] sins
[1:10:44] God had revealed to him about the
[1:10:47] substitute isn't that right
[1:10:49] and talk him up on the Rock took a rock
[1:10:52] in his hand for a lance and pulled his
[1:10:54] little head back and chopped and hacked
[1:10:57] him until he died and his wool bathed
[1:11:00] with his own blood he wallowed in his
[1:11:03] own blood it was a shadow but on that
[1:11:06] day at Calvary there wasn't the Lamb of
[1:11:08] this Earth but it was the Lamb of God
[1:11:10] that was dying wallowing in his own
[1:11:13] blood he was hacked and chopped and beat
[1:11:16] and spit on and slammed and smacked and
[1:11:19] everything in the world and that blood
[1:11:21] dropping off of his locks when Abel's
[1:11:24] lamb died it died speaking in unknown
[1:11:27] language that Abel could not understand
[1:11:29] it was bleeding and when God lamb died
[1:11:32] that they had Calvary he spoke in an
[1:11:34] unknown language that no one understood
[1:11:36] him my God my God why has Thou forsaken
[1:11:40] me it was God's lamb hacked to Pieces
[1:11:42] chopped up
[1:11:43] he was the very lamb that Abel had in
[1:11:46] mind
[1:11:47] when he seen the promised seed of the
[1:11:50] woman he was the lamb that Daniel saw
[1:11:52] when he was hewed out of a mountain
[1:11:54] without hands he was a wheel in the
[1:11:56] middle of a wheel that the prophet
[1:11:57] Isaiah says all they foresaw was met on
[1:12:01] that day that day on Calvary it brought
[1:12:05] that great thing and it broke the back
[1:12:08] of Satan
[1:12:10] amen praise be to God
[1:12:13] amen now notice now first we seek him
[1:12:17] talking about what that day meant second
[1:12:20] we should see what that day has done for
[1:12:22] us
[1:12:24] now third let's look at what we ought to
[1:12:26] do for that day we ought to do what we
[1:12:29] ought to do first we should look into it
[1:12:31] it's a great day greatest day of all
[1:12:33] days sin price was settled Satan's power
[1:12:35] was broken now we want to see what we
[1:12:38] should do in
[1:12:40] return
[1:12:41] amen
[1:12:44] in return
[1:12:46] now in return it's when Jesus died at
[1:12:49] Calvary on Calvary that day he not only
[1:12:52] paid the price for our sins but he also
[1:12:54] paid the price and listen to this made a
[1:12:58] way
[1:12:59] that we could follow him
[1:13:03] amen how many beliefs Jesus
[1:13:06] hello me
[1:13:08] come unto me all ye who are weary and
[1:13:10] heavy laden now he did that for us now
[1:13:13] what do we do amen now listen now
[1:13:18] there's where we lose our position if we
[1:13:21] don't watch we try to look back to what
[1:13:23] he was to what we was we try to look
[1:13:26] back to what we was isn't that why the
[1:13:29] devil's always doing in our minds
[1:13:32] he's always trying to take us back make
[1:13:34] us look at our faults
[1:13:37] our failures I mean you'll never be a
[1:13:39] happy Christian if you focus on your
[1:13:41] faults
[1:13:44] folks I don't like to even think of I'm
[1:13:47] blocking them out right now because when
[1:13:48] you go even thinking about the stupid
[1:13:51] stuff
[1:13:52] huh
[1:13:53] some really really things that you
[1:13:55] absolutely regret
[1:13:57] we should have never done
[1:14:02] but we don't look at that do we no
[1:14:06] you can't never be a happy person
[1:14:07] looking back
[1:14:09] you'll never get bitter by Looking Back
[1:14:13] amen
[1:14:15] as long as we look back to what we was
[1:14:17] the sacrifice don't mean nothing to us
[1:14:20] amen
[1:14:22] oh can't you see a church I wouldn't try
[1:14:25] to do the job I can and neither can you
[1:14:27] there's no need of trying you're lost to
[1:14:30] begin with as long as you look at what
[1:14:32] you've done but you don't look at what
[1:14:34] you've done you look at what he did for
[1:14:38] you he looked at that day on Calvary
[1:14:42] how many knows it makes all the
[1:14:45] difference in the world
[1:14:47] it's kind of like
[1:14:49] you got to forgive yourself
[1:14:52] isn't it it's kind of like you got to
[1:14:54] forgive yourself because a lot of people
[1:14:56] oh I don't think he'll forgive me you're
[1:14:58] not forgiving yourself because he is
[1:14:59] willing
[1:15:01] by the thing I've just done too much no
[1:15:04] you haven't if you still got a desire in
[1:15:06] your heart at all just a little tinkle
[1:15:08] all you need a little Trinkle in your
[1:15:09] heart to want to serve God that means
[1:15:12] that God will forgive you for it
[1:15:14] because I believe that if you truly had
[1:15:16] cost you would never desired
[1:15:19] you'd have no tingle at all you wouldn't
[1:15:20] believe it for a minute
[1:15:22] but if you'll know that God will forgive
[1:15:24] he is so abundant in forgiveness
[1:15:28] it's the most forgiving God there are
[1:15:30] there is there is no other God but he's
[1:15:33] a very forgiving God put it that way
[1:15:35] he's very forgiven he's more forgiving
[1:15:37] than any of us are
[1:15:39] he's more willing to forgive
[1:15:42] I mean even that church did not think
[1:15:44] that Paul should be no leader after he
[1:15:47] persecuted the church consented to the
[1:15:49] stoning of Stevens and took everybody's
[1:15:51] coat while they went over there stoned
[1:15:53] Stephen he was a part of it too
[1:15:55] he was just as guilty as the one that
[1:15:57] threw the Rock
[1:15:59] he was a murderer and everything else
[1:16:01] but God forgive him
[1:16:03] amen
[1:16:05] praise be to God
[1:16:07] so now notice don't look at what you are
[1:16:09] what you were
[1:16:11] not I just maybe maybe
[1:16:14] let me just
[1:16:17] um
[1:16:20] let me finish this and then I want to go
[1:16:22] get my scripture side of things
[1:16:25] now notice
[1:16:26] we wouldn't try to do the job but you
[1:16:28] know don't look at what you've done look
[1:16:30] what he did it paid your price it
[1:16:32] settled that question do you though your
[1:16:35] sins be a Scarlet they'll be white as
[1:16:37] snow though they're red light Crimson
[1:16:39] they'll be quite like wool then you have
[1:16:41] no sin you are perfectly sinless no
[1:16:44] matter what you've done or what you do
[1:16:46] you're still sinless as long as you've
[1:16:48] accepted Christ as your savior your sins
[1:16:50] are forgiven
[1:16:52] amen and anything that's forgiven is
[1:16:55] remitted and forgot about amen then what
[1:16:59] does it do it gives you after that
[1:17:01] condition his Spirit to follow him to do
[1:17:04] as he did for others who is Following on
[1:17:09] praise be to God
[1:17:11] I kind of went in this direction but I
[1:17:13] wanted to bring another side of this
[1:17:15] okay and I'll continue on this here
[1:17:18] perhaps in a minute first of all we know
[1:17:20] that this power
[1:17:23] and I told you I wanted to kind of go
[1:17:24] into detail earlier I want to go into
[1:17:26] that detail now
[1:17:28] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:17:30] wisdom of men but in the power of God in
[1:17:34] other words how do we what do what
[1:17:36] happens when we demonstrate the power of
[1:17:39] almighty god well you know we could say
[1:17:42] well that you know move mountains and
[1:17:45] raise the dead and heal the sick and so
[1:17:46] forth but you know there's greater
[1:17:48] things than that
[1:17:50] there's much greater things than raising
[1:17:52] the dead and Healing The Sick and and
[1:17:54] moving mountains and so forth
[1:17:57] because all that is temporary if you get
[1:17:59] healed you'll die again if you raise
[1:18:01] from that you'll die again but there's
[1:18:03] something greater
[1:18:04] and one of the greatest things now
[1:18:06] notice let's talk about this power that
[1:18:08] Paul
[1:18:09] talked about amen according as his power
[1:18:12] Peter said in first through II Peter 1
[1:18:16] and verse 3 according as his divine
[1:18:18] power has given unto us all things that
[1:18:21] pertain to life and godliness
[1:18:26] how many please God doesn't just do a
[1:18:29] halfway job when he gives you something
[1:18:30] he gives you everything that you have
[1:18:32] need of for godliness and for life
[1:18:36] everything
[1:18:38] through the knowledge of him that hath
[1:18:39] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[1:18:42] are given unto us exceeding and great
[1:18:45] and precious promises that the that uh
[1:18:49] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:18:54] the divine nature
[1:18:59] I mean those they'll never overcome any
[1:19:03] other way unless you've got the life
[1:19:06] that Jesus had
[1:19:08] when he overcame
[1:19:11] y'all remember brother Ben what he said
[1:19:13] about the watermelon or or Beethoven if
[1:19:15] you have the spirit of Beethoven amen
[1:19:17] you're going to write music if you have
[1:19:18] a Dillinger amen you're going to have
[1:19:20] guns to shoot people if you have a wide
[1:19:22] herb you're going to have a spirit of
[1:19:23] that and whatever Spirit you have is you
[1:19:26] have an edge of nature with that Spirit
[1:19:28] now
[1:19:29] and I thought about this there's just
[1:19:31] the one of the greatest forces
[1:19:35] what do we say about Mother Nature
[1:19:37] it was one of the greatest forces that
[1:19:40] there is is Mother Nature
[1:19:43] your nature your nature is the most
[1:19:46] powerful thing that there is
[1:19:49] I mean it's just so hard for you to
[1:19:54] fight your nature it's just your nature
[1:20:02] huh
[1:20:09] Paul said you know and you hathy
[1:20:13] quickened who were once dead in
[1:20:14] trespasses and sin where any times past
[1:20:17] you walked according to the course of
[1:20:19] this world according to the prince of
[1:20:21] the power of the air
[1:20:23] the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:20:25] children of Disobedience among whom also
[1:20:28] we had our life or conversations in
[1:20:32] times past in the lust of the flesh
[1:20:34] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[1:20:37] of the mind and were by Nature the
[1:20:41] children of Wrath
[1:20:45] oh my folks if you could see me at 17
[1:20:48] years old right now
[1:20:50] it wouldn't be very pleasant
[1:20:53] it wouldn't be very good
[1:20:55] our Bob looked like a girl I had hair
[1:20:57] down to here
[1:20:59] down on my own long hair and everything
[1:21:01] else served the devil with my nature you
[1:21:04] know
[1:21:05] and you know brother bear I'm talking
[1:21:07] about how that you know where he
[1:21:08] compared us to Eagles in the chicken
[1:21:09] yard right but I I I I don't know
[1:21:15] let's just put it this way
[1:21:17] let me re put my own thought in this
[1:21:20] we're like a sheep we're like a sheep
[1:21:23] with a wolf nature
[1:21:28] uh where a sheep with a wolf nature
[1:21:32] now notice what it says here Paul said
[1:21:34] we were there we were by Nature the
[1:21:37] children of Wrath in other words we had
[1:21:40] a nature of Wrath but how many knows
[1:21:42] that the prophet said you know that seed
[1:21:44] that sound on the inside it's got to be
[1:21:46] a seed of God
[1:21:47] we're either sheep or we're not sheep
[1:21:51] so we actually are sheep with a wolf
[1:21:53] nature and God has to come down and what
[1:21:57] he has to do he has to change our nature
[1:22:00] oh yeah
[1:22:03] that is a true demonstration of the
[1:22:06] power of the Holy Ghost when you see a
[1:22:09] heart that become a saint when you
[1:22:11] become a sinner and when you see a
[1:22:13] sinner becoming a saint amen somebody
[1:22:15] that was violent wretched I mean as
[1:22:17] could be God comes out and changes your
[1:22:20] marriage desires
[1:22:22] cause you can't fight tonight you can't
[1:22:25] fight your desire amen you've got to
[1:22:27] have the desire of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:22:29] it says if you'd be led by this beard
[1:22:31] you're not subject to the law of sin of
[1:22:34] death
[1:22:35] yeah
[1:22:37] Hallelujah most powerful force in the
[1:22:40] world and if God changed God has to come
[1:22:42] and change your desires you won't change
[1:22:46] people you know but just by shaking
[1:22:48] hands they're making some Reformation
[1:22:49] that doesn't change they have to have a
[1:22:52] nature change and and Peter here talking
[1:22:55] about that power that divine power
[1:22:58] has given us all to things that we might
[1:23:01] be what he gave us that power that we
[1:23:04] might be partakers of that divine nature
[1:23:09] in other words you've got to have his
[1:23:10] life
[1:23:11] how many believe that it's got to be
[1:23:14] God's life nothing else will do people
[1:23:20] are you ready
[1:23:21] let's go on and I wanted to go with uh
[1:23:25] talk to you about now I'm going to just
[1:23:26] say this because this is really what I
[1:23:28] had in my mind isn't it nice would you
[1:23:30] rather see your husband or your wife
[1:23:32] amen maybe do a great miracle
[1:23:35] but maybe they're just mean on their
[1:23:36] snake it's just ornery and man they're
[1:23:38] hard to get along
[1:23:39] they're rude maybe your husband's rude
[1:23:42] wife's food whichever it might be but
[1:23:43] isn't it nice when that person and it
[1:23:45] goes from rude to kind
[1:23:47] it's sweet
[1:23:51] loving
[1:23:53] I mean like somebody that's patient
[1:23:56] huh why are you all so quiet here I
[1:23:59] ain't talking about nobody it's for all
[1:24:01] of us
[1:24:05] you know I try to do that with my mind
[1:24:07] let me use it I try to use that for my
[1:24:09] Lord help her to see that power of my
[1:24:12] nature change and my my kindness that'd
[1:24:15] be more kind because the Bible said be
[1:24:17] kind one another
[1:24:19] and the Fruit of the Spirit and the
[1:24:20] fruit of the fruit of the flesh
[1:24:21] undulations I was going to go through
[1:24:23] but I just want to mention it you know
[1:24:24] it's so nice when you see somebody amen
[1:24:26] I'm sure Legion hello it was so mean
[1:24:29] until he was in the rocks and the and
[1:24:31] and the tombs right he lived in the
[1:24:33] tombs and his family couldn't he
[1:24:35] couldn't live with nobody he'd go out on
[1:24:37] the road and beat people down
[1:24:39] he jumped on people it wasn't he and man
[1:24:41] I'll tell you what we went down the
[1:24:43] other road we went down to Hallelujah
[1:24:45] Avenue instead of Legion Street
[1:24:49] we go the long way around
[1:24:52] ain't nobody going down that road he was
[1:24:54] me but after Jesus healed him he went
[1:24:57] home and he was kind and he was gentle
[1:24:59] that's the way with the sinner I don't
[1:25:01] care what you are but you get the Holy
[1:25:03] Ghost and it'll change your nature
[1:25:07] that's the most powerful work that can
[1:25:09] be done it's to change your nature from
[1:25:12] a pig to a sheep or from a wolf
[1:25:17] Bible says you know what there's strife
[1:25:19] and contention there's every evil work
[1:25:21] hello we've all been at that place of
[1:25:23] strife and contagion and it's a terrible
[1:25:25] thing and we've been people that are
[1:25:27] just so nice and kind I don't know about
[1:25:29] you but I don't hang around that kind
[1:25:30] it's kind in gentle I don't want to hate
[1:25:33] strife
[1:25:35] bitterness and emulation and wrath all
[1:25:37] of the fruits of this flesh that he
[1:25:39] talked about
[1:25:40] all of the nature of the flesh
[1:25:43] to the nature of the spirit how many
[1:25:45] beliefs we've been changed from the
[1:25:46] nature of the flesh
[1:25:48] to the nature of the spirit and that is
[1:25:50] truly what we see in each other that's a
[1:25:53] demonstration that's one of them anyway
[1:25:54] the demonstration of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:57] yeah that's right it'll make your kids
[1:26:00] if they come to the Altar and they get
[1:26:01] more of God it'll make your kids be more
[1:26:04] obedient to their parents
[1:26:06] they'll be willing to do what they're
[1:26:08] told a whole lot better are y'all
[1:26:10] listening children
[1:26:11] and you'll say wow my little Sonny Boy
[1:26:14] my little daughter let's change
[1:26:15] something's happening too huh
[1:26:19] why because God got a hold of them
[1:26:23] amen
[1:26:27] I thought that's so wonderful aren't you
[1:26:29] glad for what Peter said giving us a
[1:26:32] part of his divine nature
[1:26:34] laughs
[1:26:36] oh my we're going to go a little long
[1:26:38] tonight is that okay
[1:26:40] okay
[1:26:42] so now after he gives you after he gives
[1:26:44] you that forgiveness of sins and so
[1:26:46] forth he says after that condition then
[1:26:48] he gives his Spirit to follow him and as
[1:26:50] to do as he did how many believes that
[1:26:53] The Works that I do shahidu also that's
[1:26:58] what Jesus said and Greater Works Than
[1:27:00] This D shall you do someone said how can
[1:27:03] you stand to let somebody call you such
[1:27:05] a bad name
[1:27:07] because you don't live for yourself you
[1:27:09] live for others that you might redeem
[1:27:10] that man you become Sons the trouble of
[1:27:13] it is with the church has forgot that
[1:27:15] they are Sons see your son your
[1:27:19] taking Christ
[1:27:22] 's place
[1:27:26] I will be with you even in you to the
[1:27:29] end of the world
[1:27:31] amen how many believe that
[1:27:33] the pope claims this position the
[1:27:36] Catholic Church claims this position
[1:27:38] vicarious freely D on the top of the
[1:27:41] Pope's Crown instead of the Son of God
[1:27:43] hello
[1:27:45] instead of the son of God
[1:27:47] you're taking Christ's place in other
[1:27:50] words Christ was uh here on Earth in the
[1:27:54] flesh of his body but now he's in his
[1:27:55] church
[1:27:57] amen by one Spirit are we all baptized
[1:28:00] into one body amen your son so don't
[1:28:03] live for yourself live for others my
[1:28:06] brother Ben and I can live for this
[1:28:08] brother because sure he is a nice man he
[1:28:11] says that's not it live for that man who
[1:28:12] hates you live for that man who would
[1:28:14] kill you if he could
[1:28:19] amen
[1:28:21] that's what they've done to him they
[1:28:22] killed him and he died that he might
[1:28:24] save them that's eternal life when
[1:28:27] that's in your bosom you're facing
[1:28:28] heaven then but you sacrifice your own
[1:28:31] things give them up like the sheep gives
[1:28:33] up this wool then you're looking towel
[1:28:36] Calvary now listen to this we're going
[1:28:38] to get
[1:28:38] to my to to the quote that I had been
[1:28:41] looking for
[1:28:43] now I hope this helps you to get you to
[1:28:45] the place that's what the Tabernacle
[1:28:47] here that's what all people has got to
[1:28:49] do is find what you are and what's your
[1:28:53] purpose
[1:28:54] Church isn't just coming to church to
[1:28:56] play music and sing songs
[1:28:59] church is a place where judgment comes
[1:29:02] begins at the house of God and we must
[1:29:04] reckon ourselves dead and alive in
[1:29:08] Christ
[1:29:09] amen
[1:29:10] how many knows did every Avenue of the
[1:29:12] flesh you got to watch you got to be
[1:29:15] filled with the spirit and watch every
[1:29:18] part of your flesh don't give the devil
[1:29:20] any way to get in
[1:29:22] that's the only way you'll render the
[1:29:25] devil powerless
[1:29:27] your emotions your feelings your pasts
[1:29:30] whatever it might be hello all has to be
[1:29:34] surrendered to God
[1:29:36] now notice alive in Christ then he made
[1:29:38] a way that we could sacrifice ourselves
[1:29:40] first this service and follow him if we
[1:29:44] follow him we lead to life that he led
[1:29:48] that's wonderful amen
[1:29:51] and now notice Jesus said that that day
[1:29:54] that he would separate the people like
[1:29:56] sheep from goats amen and he would say
[1:29:59] to the goats stand on my left side and
[1:30:01] the Sheep stand on my right side
[1:30:03] uh oh the goats on the left he said and
[1:30:06] he'll say to them depart from me because
[1:30:08] I was hungry and you didn't feed me I
[1:30:10] was in prison and you did not visit me I
[1:30:13] was naked and you didn't call me I was
[1:30:15] thirsty and you gave me that drink I was
[1:30:16] sick you didn't visit me so apart from
[1:30:19] me and on the sheep he said I was hungry
[1:30:21] and you fed me
[1:30:22] I was naked you got me called me I was
[1:30:24] thinking you ministered to me and
[1:30:26] noticed and don't fail to get this
[1:30:28] church keep this in your heart forever
[1:30:30] it was so unconsciously done
[1:30:35] amen
[1:30:37] it was so and I like to think they did
[1:30:40] it because it was just there nature
[1:30:45] how many believes it has to be
[1:30:47] your nature
[1:30:50] now this is a really
[1:30:52] Sticky Thing
[1:30:54] it's a fine line it's a real Revelation
[1:30:56] for us because remember one place it
[1:30:59] says that they'll come to me on that day
[1:31:01] and say haven't we cast out devil have
[1:31:02] we done Mighty works and haven't we done
[1:31:04] all these things
[1:31:06] oh they did they realize they were doing
[1:31:09] it and they you know
[1:31:11] they weren't doing it unconsciously they
[1:31:13] were trying to use that thing and that
[1:31:14] was going to get him to Heaven can we
[1:31:16] say that it wasn't their nature
[1:31:18] now listen to what the prophet says and
[1:31:21] man that gives you something or other
[1:31:22] because you ought to do it a man that
[1:31:24] feeds you because you ought to do it
[1:31:25] he's got a selfish idea it should be
[1:31:28] your very life
[1:31:30] your very action
[1:31:32] I mean those most of the time people
[1:31:33] when they do something for you or
[1:31:35] whatever it is a lot of times it's well
[1:31:37] I expect the favor back or you're
[1:31:39] looking for a favor if you are looking
[1:31:40] for a favor back you ain't got no reward
[1:31:43] coming at all
[1:31:45] amen
[1:31:47] that's the way how many places that we
[1:31:49] all we're all that we're here I believe
[1:31:50] if anybody any of us needs us anything
[1:31:53] you wouldn't have to coax us or we
[1:31:54] didn't have no thinking about we'd do it
[1:31:57] because it's our nature amen
[1:32:00] now notice and it was so surprising to
[1:32:02] the sheep that they said Lord when were
[1:32:04] we when were you hungry and we fed you
[1:32:06] when were you hungry and we fed you and
[1:32:08] so forth and closed and thirsty and gave
[1:32:10] you a drink when did we Minister it was
[1:32:12] so automatically out of love
[1:32:16] it's just their life lived in them God
[1:32:20] let the people see what Calvary did for
[1:32:21] us so automatically when were you Lord
[1:32:24] we never knew you now notice and then so
[1:32:27] much as you've down under these you have
[1:32:28] done it unto me unselfish life not the
[1:32:31] second thought not to think about it
[1:32:34] but you are so dead to the things of
[1:32:37] this world and so alive in Christ and so
[1:32:39] walking on that Highway that these
[1:32:41] things just come in are an automatic
[1:32:45] thing
[1:32:47] but it says I'll tell you I like what I
[1:32:49] just go through today Amen in the
[1:32:51] morning and go down my knees and say
[1:32:53] Lord It's a good time to pray about noon
[1:32:55] or whatever I know what I want to pray
[1:32:56] it doesn't even have to be in them new
[1:32:58] I'll be out there in my own Barn they're
[1:33:00] in that little compartment a certain
[1:33:02] little room there if I get half the
[1:33:03] chance on the old on there on that
[1:33:05] Soulful and crazy Lord
[1:33:07] you know let me I won't talk to you for
[1:33:09] a little bit huh
[1:33:11] I remember brother Brown says when you
[1:33:13] come by to church he says stop there
[1:33:14] come over here to The Altar and pray for
[1:33:15] a while I try to remember a lot of times
[1:33:17] I remember oh yeah that's prophet and
[1:33:19] I'll say it's not let me let me do what
[1:33:20] the prophet said amen because sometimes
[1:33:22] we get so busy we don't but how many
[1:33:24] knows you want to do it just
[1:33:25] automatically just automatically hey
[1:33:27] this is just it's what I am
[1:33:30] not something that you force yourself
[1:33:33] sometimes we have to you know either oh
[1:33:35] men come Wednesday nights oh I'm glad to
[1:33:37] go to church it's automatic or do we
[1:33:39] have to say oh my God I have to force
[1:33:41] myself tonight
[1:33:43] amen sometimes we feel that way don't we
[1:33:46] you know but just odd It's gotta be your
[1:33:50] life it's your nature
[1:33:52] when we pray for another when Peter uh
[1:33:55] Peter knew this nature didn't he
[1:33:57] he had so much of the life of Jesus
[1:33:59] Christ he didn't have to go pray when
[1:34:00] that man was impotent there and he
[1:34:02] couldn't walk and so forth by the way
[1:34:03] the December and so forth and you know
[1:34:05] and and he was asking for alms
[1:34:08] you know he says help me help me help me
[1:34:10] I can't walk you know and Peter
[1:34:13] perceived that he had faith
[1:34:15] and he says well I'm sorry son we're
[1:34:18] broke this morning
[1:34:20] we ain't got no we spent maybe our last
[1:34:23] 10 cents for for our breakfast we ain't
[1:34:25] got a dime to give you
[1:34:28] are you sure that pretty sure because
[1:34:31] the Bible says he told him silver and
[1:34:33] gold we don't have any we have none but
[1:34:36] such as we have we give unto you in the
[1:34:38] name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk
[1:34:40] the man jumped up and leaped and he said
[1:34:43] now I'm getting me a job I ain't gonna
[1:34:45] never beg again
[1:34:46] huh
[1:34:48] what was it with Peter it was just
[1:34:50] automatic how many please that's the way
[1:34:52] we ought to be or this brother or this
[1:34:55] Sister's Secret or whatever you know
[1:34:56] it's just and the name of Jesus Christ
[1:34:58] you know just do it automatically see we
[1:35:01] but what we do half the time we're we we
[1:35:03] we we're we're beat before we ever even
[1:35:05] ask well now I don't know if I'm holy
[1:35:07] enough for this or if I'm live bright
[1:35:09] enough for this and I guess I'll try to
[1:35:11] ask God but you don't probably have lost
[1:35:13] it all already
[1:35:14] you've done doubted your to yourself in
[1:35:16] the first just do what he said how many
[1:35:19] people just do what's in here
[1:35:21] follow the leading of the spirit
[1:35:24] amen because that is what's going to
[1:35:27] render the devil powerless nothing else
[1:35:29] God's life is the only thing that'll
[1:35:32] rendered the devil powerless and you
[1:35:34] have to live it by day amen how many of
[1:35:36] those oh my let me try to finish here
[1:35:39] all right
[1:35:41] so unconsciously that's right so
[1:35:43] surprising the Sheep when did we ever do
[1:35:45] it oh my
[1:35:50] now notice
[1:35:52] now I use I know I say well
[1:35:56] whatever the Lord wants me to if the
[1:35:58] Lord wants me to do that I'll do that
[1:36:01] and he says you're just part of him it's
[1:36:03] his spirit's in you and you actually and
[1:36:07] you act the way he acted did you get it
[1:36:10] there's a way that seems right unto man
[1:36:12] but then thereof is the ways of
[1:36:16] death
[1:36:18] now that down Cal repeat the price so
[1:36:20] that we could be
[1:36:21] that way not saying you know we know
[1:36:24] Jones one time she was out of code and I
[1:36:27] went and bought her some coal ah I tell
[1:36:30] you I seen the brother that needed a
[1:36:32] suit of clothes and I went and got him a
[1:36:33] suit of clothes bless God I'm a
[1:36:35] Christian
[1:36:38] oh my you selfish poor miserable person
[1:36:41] you hypocrite
[1:36:45] huh that's what brother Brown says don't
[1:36:48] let your right hand know what your left
[1:36:50] hand does
[1:36:51] amen nor you left what's your right hand
[1:36:54] does you don't brag about little things
[1:36:56] that you do
[1:36:57] amen you just you're just so
[1:37:01] automatically dead in Christ till you do
[1:37:05] it anyhow now I love this
[1:37:07] it's your nature
[1:37:10] I mean you see how long my thought was
[1:37:11] on the nature part and the Lord let me
[1:37:14] down this road and I said boy that's
[1:37:15] just perfect amen it's your nature
[1:37:20] it's your makeup you do it anyhow it's
[1:37:24] just the life that lives in you you're
[1:37:27] completely yielded to that spirit and it
[1:37:30] just lives itself in you
[1:37:33] sheep on one side one will say Lord we
[1:37:35] did this and Lord we did that he's
[1:37:37] hitting apart from me you work yourself
[1:37:39] and they make good day I never knew you
[1:37:40] if the church can ever get to those
[1:37:43] fundamental facts
[1:37:45] that it's not something that you try to
[1:37:47] do you work yourself up to do is
[1:37:50] something that's born in you
[1:37:53] amen Lord help us ah I'm gonna say Lord
[1:37:57] help me help me to be that way it's just
[1:38:00] something that's born in you
[1:38:02] praise be to God
[1:38:05] how many believe this is the way of a
[1:38:06] birth
[1:38:09] Hallelujah
[1:38:12] now notice in closing last quote last
[1:38:16] page should I say
[1:38:18] we look at it and we say oh yes that's
[1:38:20] wonderful what Christ did
[1:38:23] on Calvary
[1:38:25] if that Son of God had to go to Calgary
[1:38:27] for crucifixion then every son that
[1:38:30] comes must go to a Calvary he must also
[1:38:33] have a Calvary
[1:38:35] you must have that day
[1:38:38] on Calvary
[1:38:41] well I thought he went to Calvary for me
[1:38:44] do you realize Jesus said he that kicks
[1:38:45] not up his cross and follow me in that
[1:38:48] worthy of me in other words there's a
[1:38:49] cross for you
[1:38:51] there's a dying for you there's a dying
[1:38:53] for me
[1:38:55] how many beliefs we could see Lord I
[1:38:57] need to have a little bit more of a
[1:38:58] Calvary I need to die to myself more or
[1:39:01] take all of that fruit of that flesh leg
[1:39:03] Let It Go by the wayside so that I can
[1:39:05] have the fruit of the spirit and be
[1:39:06] completely Victorious
[1:39:08] I've got to have that day at Calvary God
[1:39:11] settles the same sin question Not Shake
[1:39:13] Hands with the preachers not be shook
[1:39:15] into the church or come by a letter or
[1:39:18] by profession but by a birth amen
[1:39:21] Jesus said unless you are born again and
[1:39:23] ye shall in the wise enter into the
[1:39:25] Kingdom of Heaven amen
[1:39:28] praise the Lord then from that
[1:39:31] automatically we're living Christian
[1:39:32] lives and here's a real good point
[1:39:36] now notice the Greater Works
[1:39:39] was to have power in the church not only
[1:39:43] to heal the Sick by prayer cast out
[1:39:46] Devils by prayer
[1:39:48] that was not the Greater Works
[1:39:50] but to impart eternal life to Believers
[1:39:54] the Holy Ghost is coming is coming and
[1:39:57] given into the hands of the church to
[1:40:00] impart life oh that's what Gallery meant
[1:40:03] it took stoop degraded men and women
[1:40:07] Paul Peter fisherman Tax Collectors
[1:40:11] cheaters and everything else and lifted
[1:40:14] them into a place to be sons of God to
[1:40:16] heal the sick and to impart eternal life
[1:40:19] by giving Holy Ghost to obedient
[1:40:22] Believers like Peter did
[1:40:25] at the house of Cornelius while you yet
[1:40:27] speak these words the Holy Ghost was
[1:40:30] Departed
[1:40:31] Paul Acts 19 remember those disciples he
[1:40:35] came and have you received the Holy
[1:40:36] Ghost since you believed laid their
[1:40:38] hands on them and they received the Holy
[1:40:40] Ghost
[1:40:42] Church of the Living God is to impart
[1:40:44] not just healing
[1:40:47] amen
[1:40:49] but to impart something that lasts for
[1:40:51] eternity
[1:40:52] Jesus says Greater Works than these
[1:40:55] shall ye do how many knows you said that
[1:41:01] men who were once unbelievers be made
[1:41:04] Believers and impart spiritual eternal
[1:41:06] life how much greater is it to say to
[1:41:09] this sick woman laying here I can pray
[1:41:10] the prayer of faith and shall be egged
[1:41:12] that's a say heal that's a great thing
[1:41:15] that's what he was doing then but he
[1:41:17] said greater than initial you do because
[1:41:19] I'm going to give you power not only to
[1:41:21] raise up for a while but to give him
[1:41:24] eternal life which will be
[1:41:28] eternally
[1:41:29] poor blind wretched people how do you
[1:41:32] miss it don't you see what the greater
[1:41:34] thing is that's the greatest thing that
[1:41:36] we could ever happen is to impart
[1:41:39] eternal life to people
[1:41:41] and I kind of thought you know and if
[1:41:44] you have and when you receive that
[1:41:46] eternal life how many knows that's what
[1:41:48] changes your nature
[1:41:52] you got to have that nature change from
[1:41:54] your old nature to the nature of Jesus
[1:41:57] Christ
[1:42:00] amen
[1:42:02] praise the Lord
[1:42:04] God bless you let's stand
[1:42:10] Hallelujah
[1:42:15] what is eternal life the life that he
[1:42:18] lived the life that was in him impart
[1:42:21] that to others can a man do that
[1:42:24] a Son of God can
[1:42:26] Jesus said whosoever sins you remit to
[1:42:29] them they are remitted whosoever since
[1:42:32] you retained to them they are retained
[1:42:33] here's what the Catholic church and many
[1:42:35] others made their big mistake they go
[1:42:38] out and say well I forgive you of your
[1:42:39] sin
[1:42:40] that wasn't it how did they get sins
[1:42:43] forgiven in the Bible Peter answered
[1:42:46] that question on the day of Pentecost
[1:42:48] what shall we do to be saved how we can
[1:42:51] how can we get this that you got he laid
[1:42:54] down to prescription he told them what
[1:42:56] to do repent every one of you and be
[1:43:00] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:43:01] Christ for the remissions of your sins
[1:43:04] and you shall receive the gifts of the
[1:43:06] Holy Ghost for the promises to you to
[1:43:09] your children
[1:43:10] to them that are far off even as the
[1:43:13] many as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:43:15] that is the prescription on how to get
[1:43:19] eternal life how to have your sins
[1:43:22] forgiven there is no other name given
[1:43:24] under heaven whereby we must be saved
[1:43:28] amen let's give the Lord a hand say

[1:43:48] to the keys to the kingdom of heaven so
[1:43:50] that we can open up and get into the
[1:43:52] kingdom of heaven and render the devil
