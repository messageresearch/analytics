thank you [Music] foreign [Music] brothers and sisters we'll just stand this morning brother Joe will open us in prayer this moment foreign how many children can be dismissed for Sunday School and then we'll go in the songs 27 which is beautiful outside it's a little colder today but sure was a beautiful day yesterday psalms 27 the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid on house shooting Camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident we're in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock now here O Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me I not thy face far from me but not thy servant life in Anger thou I have seen my help leave me not neither forsake me o God of my salvation my ball teach me thy way O Lord and Lead Me in the plane path because of mine enemies I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage he shall strengthen in my heart wait I say on the Lord God bless you may be seated brother Brian brothers and sisters um if you would turn with me I was thinking as brother uh Phil was preaching last uh Wednesday scripture here that really strikes out in the psalm here you know some of us haven't been asked to do this but excuse me for my voice here but um the 10th verse and that's on when it says when my mother excuse me when my father and my mother forsake me then Lord I Lord will take me up you know some most of us haven't been had that experience where to serve Christ and to serve the Lord where your mother and father forsake you well you know that scripture really has a lot of meaning that means as a as a man or as a daughter or son or a daughter when your father and mother forsake you that's pretty brutal you know but even here Dave is willing to put it all on on God and put it all on Christ no matter what happens around him he's gonna follow the path that God gives him the father whether his mother his father forsake Him whether his children forsaken What it could be the opposite whether your children forsake you whatever whatever is going to walk away from you because you make that right decision it he is willing to count it all lost just to embrace it but I was listening to Phil on Wednesday you know this chapter here this eighth chapter in Matthew uh you know me I have a tendency to jump right into things I'm there's a lot that goes on in this chapter you know you know the gospel says sometimes we forget it John said in the end of his Gospel of all the things were written that Jesus did while he was on the face of the Earth there wouldn't be enough books to contain the writings of all the things that Christ did while he was on the face of the Earth and especially in the last three and a half years of his life but you take the this eighth chapter here there's a lot of things that Jesus did before you get to this the last situation that brother Phil was talking about on Wednesday the first one is to heal the leopard and at no time in the other than Eliza healing name in the leper outside of that no one in Israel had been healed and he heals a leopard and then you go further he heals the servant of the Centurion later down in the chapter and then he heals Peter's uh mother so that they she can serve them and then you get down to this last bit here and uh our I'm trying to find a place I don't want to re-read at all again but I'll just at the end after the he cast The Devils out and they go into the hurt I'll start at the 32nd verse but it's that last verse that really struck me and that's where we're at today as a church and as a world and it all started the 31st verse and it says so the devil's besought him saying if I if thou cast out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine and he said unto them go and when they had come out and really struck me you know the devil's a devil he's going to be a devil you know he they wanted to go into the swine but you know they had other purposes in what they were doing and the sole purpose of a devil is to make everybody look the opposite direction of where they really should be looking so well um remember he said that I'm going when they went or come out they went into the herd of the swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep Place into the seat and perished in the waters and you know that devils are or demons they don't ever die they just go from one place to another and then and then he goes then and they that kept them fled and went their way into the City and told everything that was befallen to the possessed of the Devils so these men go back and tell the city the good things that Jesus did for these people where you cast out the devils and then we get to this last verse which is pretty brutal and the the people of that City say behold the whole city came out to meet Jesus and when they saw them him they besought him that he would depart out of their Coast so after seeing the Miracles that were presented before them they do a 180 degree thing and they ask the very God himself to leave the city and to leave their area they didn't want him and I was just thinking that's that's pretty brutal that you're telling a living God but you don't want them in your city you don't want them in your life you don't want them in that you know that's where we're at today that's what's going on out there in the world this morning they're totally walking away from the grace and the blessings of the Lord and trying to embrace their own way in life and I was going to jump up to Thessalonians the fourth chapter here give you all I know we're getting a hurry I don't give you all a chance to catch up sometimes you know and uh I appreciate all your prayers last week uh last Friday I guess all you know that I had one of those I guess they call them a heart catheter or arterial catheter you know that's an awesome experience not in a bad way but you know they keep you awake and on the screen you can see very heart beeping and as they go for all your arteries to see if you have any blockages you know technology is a wonderful thing but I was fortunate that I didn't have any blockages the doctor was really worried I had I I'm not a nurse a doctor but I had a MRI with a high calcium a really really high calcium score so they thought I had some serious blockages and I just remember being on that table and uh I'm trying to find my place here uh being on that table watching them do their thing and then the doctor says the nurse and the doctor says he doesn't find any blockages and I yelled out real loud amen and the nurses were kind of funny yeah that's that's right so I was truly blessed uh you know you know if God is good that's all I can say but if you were to go with me to the fourth chapter you know you could get a good report one day and die the next day we don't have any continuing cities here on the earth you know we're not going to live forever like I used to tell the guys in the Army you know you're not going to live forever sooner or later you're going to die I mean so you do the best you can with the time that God gives you so going here I used to say it another way they didn't appreciate it very much but let's go to this fourth verse here furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exalt you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us that you ought to walk in to please God so he would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus and this is the world of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication now you can take that in in a natural way in a physical way but you really need to think of it in a spiritual way spiritual fornication where you're feeling your heart in life with things that you know that are contrary to the word of God not so much the physical stuff but you could do it in a spiritual way also and it goes on to say that every one of you should know how to possess this vessel and sanctification and honor not with us forgive my pronunciation hereof capaciousness even as the Gentiles which know not God and the Gentiles in this day were just our guts today I mean it's really striking that the way the Gentiles were back in Paul's day and are no different than the way us Gentiles are today a bunch of heathens and he goes on to say no man go beyond the defraud his brother in any manner because the Lord is the Avenger of all such I also have four warned you and testify for God hath not called us unto uncleanness but on the Holiness so there's a I could have been a positive and everything and he goes on to say he therefore that despises despises not men but God and who have given unto us his holy spirit and he and I'll finish with this Versace and brotherly love you need not that I write on you for you yourselves are thought of God to love one another and I was just thinking this morning I wrote this let me uh you know they were the rejection of that City this morning is a pretty brutal thing but I was thinking what do we do in our lives that we reject what God wants us to do what do we do that would kind of put them out on the outside and and I was thinking this morning the whole purpose of your enemy out there is to get you in a position where you're willing to compromise ever everything that you believe I mean I don't have a lot to say this morning but everything in that world out there is to put you in a position where you compromise everything you believe they totally are forcing you out there in the world not getting into the nitty-gritty you either have to stand with who you are and what you believe or you've gonna have to compromise and I was just thinking with the with the meteor age that we're in this morning nothing that we do whatever you do on out there in the world it's either being recorded or either on your phone on your tablet on vid everything we do is being recorded everything whatever mistake you have it's not just people knowing it anymore it's on video it's on everything so how more should we as human beings this morning realize that everything we do should be the right thing we shouldn't be willing to do the bad thing and I was you know first you know I'm coming to the end of my life I was just thinking of all as young people it's even worse for you today than it was for me when I was a young man we didn't have phones we didn't have tablets we didn't have any of those Contraptions when I was young you know so there wasn't anything to take your mind off of things and today it's just a like it's a spiritual battle you know the greatest battle brother Branham when he preached that message it's the battle in your mind and especially right now this morning there is so much that's going to try to consume your mind this morning that's going to try to take you away from the Gospel of Jesus Christ it's a it's a really horrible thing but the only way that you can stay purposed is that you choose not to see the things that you're not supposed to see this morning brother David this morning if we could man you love him with all your heart this morning and amen it's just good to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen God is good isn't he amen appreciate that Sunday school lesson and appreciate each and everyone that was here yesterday and uh we thank you

a joy to get together with God's people and I was I was just kind of a amused yesterday because uh you know I was watching them and I never was good with a gun I still saying goes I couldn't hit the broadside of the barn and I just left mine at home I told Brother Tommy I said I don't want everybody laughing and shoot somebody because they get laughing at me because I've missed so bad so I just left mine at home and it was just a joy to seeing and the young children I know they they enjoyed it they made out like Bandits they come up with bags of candy about that tall and I thought well

cooler today so to speak father and to worship you in spirit and in truth Lord Jesus knowing that Adam and Eve used to do that coming to Kula today and worship you and Lord that's what we're getting to enjoy doing this today Father it's just to gather ourselves together and to bring praise and glory and honor to you knowing father that anything that we have all comes from you Lord our very breath our very life our very existence lord it's all because of you and father we want to use every thing that we are everything that we have Lord return praise in return thanks to you Lord Jesus and I

morning in a special way as you have Lord just lately Lord you've been blessing the services in the special way and we appreciate it Lord and we know it is just you Lord and it's ministers just getting out of the way and letting you have your way father and you're the one that receives honor and Glory if I'm at all Lord and father we just want to say thank you Lord this morning for your goodness Lord bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart father in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen pray this morning we just greet you in the name of the Lord amen certainly uh was busy yesterday and amen always had on my heart on on Desiring a message from the Lord and then last night I think towards evening I went back there towards that hay bales and brother Brad he said something about he says well are you loaded and ready and brother Brad I didn't really answer you did I because I wasn't loaded already or not I was like I don't really know I'm not there yet brother I thought well maybe I ought to go to the church and just go to my office and just pray and study while everybody just does their activities and so forth and I said well it wouldn't be really nice either so I said you know and and earlier this week I felt like I did something that pleased the Lord and and after that it was just coming to my heart and my heart the Lord says I'll give you something I'll have something for you amen and and so that was Thursday and Friday so I felt comfortable the Lord was going to give me something and amen so the Lord just poured me out a little about something I felt like um a little thought that that I want to share with you with the help of the Lord amen so it just come to me last evening and amen just studying it and meditating upon it and of course you always want to make sure that it's not just you you know because um anyway so we want to make sure that it's the Lord and I just felt like it was according to his word and he just kept bringing it amen and so uh anyway we just trusted it'll be a blessing to you and it's certainly a simple thought I don't know how many has already looked at the web page of what the title is nobody looked all right you don't know yet but anyway I got to thinking about uh I forgot to thinking about uh Unity or Oneness is what I got to thinking about and but the word that came to me was Uno Uno no and I thought Uno Lord You're gonna give me Uno you know and then I got to thinking so much on Uno I thought about too and I had to look at Siri what this how do you say two in in Spanish I guess it is right and so it says dos Unos and those so that's what we're going to preach on this morning you know those amen so praise the Lord I thought boy that's awful simple brother you know but then they never thought the Lord says well you know you know what the prophet said he's the prophet said see how simple well you can be amen see how simple you can be it's not in the complicated and even the prophet said many times you know he says you know he'd give you if it's the Holy Spirit giving you something that's what's the difference amen amen so I trust it'll be a blessing to you amen so if you will amen let's just turn our Bibles uh to the book of uh Saint Jacques excuse me Saint John the 17th chapter and it is actually the Lord's Prayer amen this will be not uh the Lord's prayer that we know so well but this is the one perhaps that we don't dwell on so much but it was one of the last prayers that Jesus made amen and he made a prayer to the father for his children and those that he had given him and those that would come afterwards and there's a desire and a passion that Jesus Christ had that we want to dwell on with the help of the Lord this morning amen so let's just read here a little bit amen chapter 17 verse 1 and these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to him heaven now notice to heaven and said father so you notice that he's talking to the Father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son Also may be glorified indeed as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh wow amen how many knows he had power over All Flesh it didn't matter if they because they didn't just take his flesh and crucify did they no he allowed them to do that amen it is nobody did but what he allowed amen and I want you to know he still has the same Authority today that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is the life eternal that they might Know Thee the only true God then Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified but beyond the earth I have finished the work which thou gave us me to do amen may that be the same thing that each and every one of us can be able to say at the end of our life amen that we finish to work that he has given us to do you remember Paul said I have finished my race I have finished the course isn't that right therefore there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness amen all right and then and now oh Father glorify thy thou me uh glorify thou me with an own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou has given me out of the world thine they are down there thine they were and thou gave us them me and they have kept Thy Word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of thee for I have given unto them The Words which thou gavest me and they have received them I mean those that's a very important part and I have known surely that thou and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did sent me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine amen and I am glorified in them praise be to God how many knows that's where God is glorified in you and I and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep to thine own name Those whom thou has given me that they may be Uno one and how many knows that's his heart's desire is that you and I would be one amen as we are I mean those Jesus and the father were one I mean if you have seen me you have seen the father while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept I like that and none of them is lost except the Son of Perdition isn't that something I put that in there he didn't just say none of them's lost but he said except for the Son of Perdition because he knew that he would betray him in the first place isn't that right that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have joy fulfill my joy fulfilling themselves I have given them Thy word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that thou should take them out of the world but thou should keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as is sent me into the world so even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but I pray for all those that evening light Tabernacle listen but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word praise be to God that they all may be one amen as thou father art in me and I in thee and they also might be one in US how many please God's desire Christ's desire was that you and I amen would be one with him amen that the world may believe that God has sent me amen and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou and me that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them and has as thou has loved me may God has blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated quite a lengthy reading wasn't it but you know I hate it to just jump through these scriptures you know because I know the punch lines are in those scriptures where it talks about amen that they all may be one amen just as the father and the son were one that's how God wants us to be one now tonight as we are this morning as we talk about this we want to talk about the power of Oneness amen the power of Oneness amen so we look at the number just let's take a little thought for here just to begin with first of all just the Simplicity of one now let me ask you something if you split now I'm gonna ask this a question and somebody can raise your hand if you want to answer it if you split it one in half how much do you have what do you got if you split a one raise your hand but Joe that's one answer what about another one anybody else who's raise your hand who's talking better John you got two that's really what I was looking for they're both true but you have how many halves do you have so two see you have two when you split one and have you got two now why because the one was splitting so of course in technical terms yeah half of one is a half you know but you still have two so automatically when you split that one you've got two or notes is that right now I want you to understand something that God loves one Satan loves too amen he loves two we're going to dwell on that for a little bit and I it it all down through in almost every aspect of Our Lives we see the power of Oneness now I looked up one listen I didn't bring my phone but it talked about Unity meaning they're talking about something that is brought together and being made a uh as a whole all right as a whole because we know that as a church body amen the Bible talks about we're baptized into one body and there's one body in that light but it has many members but it's considered one body so even though there's many members it's still one that knows many members are one and that is the way it is with us and the father amen we know that amen first of all let me say this that our number the first thing that we want to do is talk about how that God is coming for a bride that is one with him let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus he wants somebody that thinks like her like him acts like him has the same spirit that he has because I may know when Adam was separated amen and he was brought out there was nothing about Eve that was part of that serpent everything about Eve was part of Adam she was a part of him amen and that's what God is looking for in this generation a bride and you know I was thinking this week amen just meditating our thinking on how that it is uh uh got a few thoughts running through here at once how did how did uh one is is simple it's straight you know even Jesus says I am the way I am the truth and I am the light I mean there's only one way and that is Christ he is the one way and he says you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free and then I got to thinking about we say that all the time but I got a fresh Revelation on that and that is what are you free from oh there's a whole lot there right there's a whole lot there but the one thing that he said he says I am the truth Sinister he is the truth because you know anything outside of the truth is what it's a lie and what is it has two parts and has part truth part lie and that's the two that the devil gave to Eve he gave her two thoughts he says you know God knows that if he did this you're gonna have two you're gonna be ghosts you're gonna know good and evil and the devil specializes and he's got the whole world and they confused any deceived State because they love too too much you gotta say with simplicity you gotta stick with that one way that one truth one life [Music] and I was thinking back to my thought talking about how that we can so clearly see how the world's going can't we imagine they have got everything they have got everything so twisted up they took prayer out of the schools and now they're scribbling people out there so confusing the kids nowadays amen until they don't know what sex they are anymore foreign that's and listen anything outside of the truth is a lie and why it's most 99 of the people amen are believing a lie and that lie is not just pure Outlaw it's something that's mixed with the truth the way that he gave it to Eve truth in it but it's also not truth in it it's mixed amen and while I talk about how that God loves Oneness how many knows God loves Oneness he hates Tunis amen what was it I believe it was brother Brandon talked a lot of and I don't know a whole lot about it but he talked about the Pentecostals some of them became Oneness and Tunis and threeness huh right some believe there's one God baptism then there was those that believed too and then there was trinitarians you know threeness and all of that and what did I'd say it caused them to split apart from each other and divide and all that he said it was is the devil amen now let me say this the God hates division God hates division amen but don't think that God will divide God does divide you don't mind dividing even Paul talked about divisions in the church and so forth and him how that you ought to separate yourself how many believe that if somebody's unruly and just won't do right separate yourself and don't keep coming if anybody causes divisions in the church he says he says smart not Man mark that man and have no company with him why because that's not God doing that because God had a little bit of that up in his church up there in heaven amen how many knows that and he kicked him out he hates that type of thing why do you think he said even amen with dates in the car he says you know they had a different idea whenever you've got two you've got two different ideas hello how many knows that in your marriage you are one you're you two are your one flesh and how sweet it is when you've got a marriage ain't nothing like me being married ain't nothing like having a good wife or a good man come on people ain't nothing like it but don't tell me that's not what if you have a real fight think about the worst fight that you had with your wife it ain't no pleasant day is it no it ain't a bit of fun come on people it ain't no fun it's stressful and you gotta go in climate tree or you'd rather live on the roof talking with a angry woman and they goes the same with a man folks if you ain't got unity and if you're having a trouble with this and it's because that you've got differences of ideas or differences of God is what causes dude those that's what causes two different ways two different directions and a lot of time to marriage the first thing you gotta establish is ahead cause somebody gotta be the head somebody gotta do some following amen oh my let me tell you something that's weird with Christ I'm glad that I have a husband that I ain't gotta never worry about making the wrong choice from you the wrong decision I can follow him I don't have to have my own thoughts of my own ideas I can know that what he is is right and could be almighty God I'll tell you this right now he said what time the Moses separate yourself from this whole month and I'll kill everybody that's one of them because this simply won't believe me you gotta separate yourself from my belief of the word of God you've got to believe every child every table you ain't gonna need no Rapture unless you believe every word you just believe one word and we gotta believe every word if you expect to make heaven that's what Jesus say about it this Unos and distorts he says there's two masters you're going to see everyone or you're going to serve the other make up your mind but if you're gonna serve me you're gonna have to be willing to separate from mama daddy brother sister you gotta be able to separate from why for children or whatever it is and I've got a note Road here let me straight into some other something out among some I'll tell you right now I believe I love my family I don't care how bad they were I still love them and I still can't help them if you're my friend I'm gonna stick by you so sick of thin one thing I will not do is partake or slide with or agree with you are wrong [Music] come on you ought to get a little pause that cause if you get sick with somebody when they're wrong you love on me sick with them sure you say that friend but you don't say you don't take time is wrong no matter what it is or who again foreign [Music] [Music] why because you love the truth more he loved Jesus more than you love your friend your brother sister wife whoever it is you love me more amen praise the Lord hey man I want to thank everybody for yesterday that was wonderful time amen it it created an atmosphere for today folks when everybody does something does their part participation thank you for your prison and first I thought all the way to whoever did the kite cleaning last night bad thing I wanted to do was run a vacuum last night laughing I was tired from all day so whoever did the cleanup you need a lot of Applause because I'll tell you what that takes a lot at the very end of the day to still go on and try to clean it up amen I know Mary Jane and and Jessica and different ones I know they do a lot of cleaning we appreciate them amen appreciate everybody man how many knows we're one oh man I want to show you with the help of the Lord the Battlefront Twitter where the Battlefront really is because how many knows if the devil can possibly divide a marriage he will do it and you gotta be on your toes and you got to be on your prayer bones you got to be ready and you got to know how these Tactics come because there's nothing like Unity you take a military force in the old times and then when they had swords and they had Shields how many knows that the Roman Empire they knew how to do battle and they know how to get everybody in the rain everybody where the place been just stand and fight against all my naked rain down arrows like it was a dark cloud or something but they'd put their Shields under the shell for the shields why because they had the shield up they knew that's what to do and that is with you and eyes oh I just love that message one day I got to listen to that again in the tree sometime Wednesday how many do you like that brother C boy I like that you know that that would isn't here to give you a hard time that's what I got from us you're here to give him a heart fine he gonna try to get you down but you're not gonna be down he's supposed to belong under your soul to your feet amen oh oh my I like what he said about you know we're all victims here God don't want victims he wants victors praise be to God I like that things like that you know because that's the truth well is that just you saying that no that's not just me saying that what does the scripture say foreign to him that overcometh well I grant to sit with me in my throne not that is over kind didn't say to him that is overcome no but to him that Overcomers with my grandpa sent me in other words I'm gonna sit with a bunch of victors victory amen praise be to God Hallelujah my when I look at this and I see where Adam was and Eve was when they were one with God is that right before the devil brings his dose around his another way a second route second idea caused her to fall eat at that tree before that Adam could say that his tree be plucked up I don't like where you are move over here huh can we say A Little Bit Stronger let's say it like Jesus said Adam could say Mountain you're you're in my way over here you know I want you to be put into the sea over here all I want to see is you from the so far up that's all I want to see huh you know and something else wasn't quite right he just speak the word and it was when you think about a man in flesh like you and I in our day speak to a storm say storm you move away now and sudden you shine for three days God backed it up how many realize this you and I still have a little climbing to do amen we still got some growing to do we still got a little unified to do with almighty God cause he says if you abide in me and I abide in you you could ask what you will and it might be done no it shall be done [Music] hello how many of you need your little Growers that's right and that's potentials there is there if you want it but you gotta dig I gotta dig and say where is it what's holding me back I don't know I haven't got a clue I might look at your life knowing that God could be living with you I might be able to tell you you could probably tell me but your job is to check it out yourself find out where you are with God thank you amen praise be to God oh my my this is just think about it it was Jesus very desire of his heart before leaving that you and I would be one with each other first you got to be one with God how many believe that you didn't really got to be one with God we got to be in this very image amen it has to be the very same thing yeah I you and you and me he says because he said in that day oh this is another Revelation that got this from this and that is amen that the scripture says that day better man said that day this day and it wasn't until this day that we knew that he was in the Father the father would yeah that he is in us and we are in him that we're one that you could never pass away that God can pass away then if you're born again tonight and God has kept you through every storm and everything I tell you that you are his amen and no man can pluck him Jesus said I've lost none of them I believe it'll be the story for you and for me he has lost Furious he's not gonna lose you don't run too far I know the balcony is a long way for you to run on that one but still isn't that nice to know that he's not gonna lose you he hadn't started to work in you to not finish it I thought that you'll know I'm in like brother Phil says you got to know who you are let the devil Know Who You Are amen praise be to God amen you could speak why because he was one but when that Oneness was broken amen because eve took of that tree have the knowledge of Good and Evil let me tell you something do you realize what deceives the whole world today is dos dose is deceiving the whole world because like the prophet said people are out there they're partaking of good coming to church but you also partaking of evil you want to keep all their evil ways but that they come to church and claim Jesus Christ that's the deceiving part folks how many knows that Jesus crime could cleanse us from all unrighteousness he came to make you to where you have nots but righteous and who you are no part of what the devil has to offer you the devil will get in any way that he possibly can anyway that he possibly can he will try to route you who is talking about that I think it was both Brian the Sunday School the devil looks at any direction to try to get to you everything you can possibly do amen so it's Illustrated of course unity and Oneness is Illustrated in a in a a military aspect of it where you just about unbeatable when you've got that type of unity hello impenetrable cannot penetrate it oh don't you want to be that kind of a soldier that has on the whole armor of God like like Paul said in Ephesians 6 putting on the whole armor of God that you might be able to stand against the Wilds of the devil not be taken by the wives of the The Shield of Faith where you will be able to quench all the fiery darts Hallelujah praise be to God amen Hallelujah amen Hallelujah separators yeah God does separate how many knows that there comes a time when God has to separate listen to this sure there's time when and it's because there's two factions isn't that right when God calls a man better man says not because he's a better than anybody else because God called him now this is for Christians now notice after call God called Abram he said the first thing I want you to do is to separate yourself that's what God does today separation [Applause] oh my we can see how the world is mixing everything up isn't that right most of the churches when they're calling for a pastor he says about the baptism so forth then the people will say well that old preacher he's an old fogy he tries to do this Saturday we want a young fellow and babam talks about a real good looking fellow or something who's a good mixer I don't want mixers got what separators separate yourself said God and I will receive you how many believe that you've got to be separated from the world separated from Darkness oh my separate from kindred from peoples from Associates separate from your bad habits separate from sin separate from unbelief let me know about abandon his life this year 65 I believe this is God calls for a total separation from my beliefs hey Ben your world Associates let me tell you something sure we have friends that's in the world probably huh but don't you worry a lot of people that uh you know if you have friends and uh you know you get born again and all of a sudden they start to lighting something up and smoke and you say hey you should do that hey you shouldn't do that you know how quick you ain't gonna worry about separating from them they'll separate from you they'll get away from you if you do what you're supposed to do it's not a life huh amen all right listen oh separate from habits that's where the first man was called by election that's where the last man's been called to do the same thing separate amen from your Associates that are unchristian I mean those were not to be influenced by the world the things of the world come out from among them and be ye separated Abraham had to believe that had to be separated from his kindergarten to drag him out oh Muhammad knows anytime you get around somebody that's an unbeliever or doubtful if they're not it's not fun to be around you want to get away from them oh oh my I'm gonna before I bring bring this other part let's talk about separation Paul Paul said in uh Romans 16. let's go to Romans 16 for a minute I got a new Bible and uh so I don't have the tabs in it so I know it's after ax yeah there it is my favorite pages are finally go straight to Corinthians and gets me all confused all right Romans 16 and 17 will begin Romans 16. now I beseech you Brethren Mark then which caused divisions among you and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them for they are such that serve not the Lord Jesus but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple First Corinthians 5. I'll quickly go through this First Corinthians 5. internet pistol not to keep company with fornic actors yet not all together with fornicators of this world or with the Covetous or the extortionators extortioners extortionate or with the or with idolaters for then must he needs go out of the world isn't that right if you're never going to be around them well you just have to leave the world he says so you're gonna have company like that but listen he says but now I have written unto you not to keep drop me if any man that is called a brother huh he isn't just doing a little thought this out of the other but he's really bad when somebody gets really bad this is what Paul says a fornicator or a Covetous or an idolater or a healer huh bailing on everybody or a drunkard or extortioner with such and one no not to eat that's where the Amish get their uh you know their band and so forth you know it isn't just necessarily it is but if you come against in any way they'll not they'll put you in the band they won't eat with you not for a lifetime but here Paul said if somebody like that look if you're not going to straighten up brother I ain't going out to eat with you I'm not hanging with you if you don't straighten up I mean no that's come to even Paul Express you come to time and another place he says you know what somebody won't repent won't repent he's actually supposed to be put onto the church put him up as a heathen a Republican cause if anybody got such a hard spirit that they won't repent you don't want them in the church anyway huh is this all right I know it's a little past early but we need it amen because why God hates division God hates anything that comes in and disrupts Unity amongst the people he hates it oh my my he hates vision amen gossip and all that stuff why because we're one all right let me just get a little further can I uncover the area of our families you got to be careful you got to keep the love between you how many knows husband wife you got to be careful because the devil is there to destroy you amen you get to thinking that your wife isn't pretty anymore your wife isn't good looking anymore and this that or the other hello start looking at another you're in for a deep trouble you'll find out what was it Phil said he says you know the devil make you think that the world's prettier but when you get out there you find out it ain't pretty at all no it ain't fun at all amen vice versa husband wife amen that will get in there anyway he can't keep that love of keep that fire aflame you know how many beliefs by the BAM says you know keep the Revival in you all the time amen he also said this your farts your sweetheart let it all please be your sweetheart I believe that keep that way amen all right now let's talk about this when I thought about the military and the lines that is in every Church a group of people here and let's go to the scriptures that comes to mind first and that is in First Corinthians 12 First Corinthians 12 we're going to talk about we know that each individual has to have a personal experience with God isn't that right God don't God don't deal necessarily with us as a group he deals with individuals okay having said that we realize that after you do get the new birth and you become a part of Christ then you do become a part of a body are you with me then it becomes then you become part of a body and this explains it in chapter 12 verse 12 for the as the body is one and hath members many members and all members of that one body being many are one body how many believe that we as a church here are one body so also is Christ now notice here as I was explaining about in its personal experience for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body you have to have that Spirit baptism experience but that Spirit baptism experience puts you into the body of Christ which is a many members body but it is still one body even though we're many members we're one body whether we be Jews Gentiles whether we Bond or free and have all been made to drink of Internet one spirit for that for the body is not one member but many and if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not the body is it therefore not the body and if the ear shall say I am not be here I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body no it is part of the body I mean if that's why it's so important and not always he Divine let me repeat that that's why it's not always easy to find the place that God has for you huh what God wants you to do and I will tell you this whatever you find God blessing you anything that God blesses you in you ought to be a happy person it is hard to find a job that you enjoy but if you find a job that you like doing that God has blessed you and he prosperences you and you're probably in the right direction is that right I don't care what it is I don't care if it's here for the what part of what God has you to do amen let's read on then it of course talks of the you know a lot of times even better Brampton everybody was trying to impersonate brother Branham and they deserve and so forth he says you don't know I have no idea what goes with it the responsibility and you know everything I can't imagine everything that the Brandon went through all I know is what he told me you wouldn't want this this is not a coveted place God has to call you to do this amen just find what God has called you to do don't try to take the football from somebody else whatever God has done called you to do now notice for the whole body were one eye where were the hearing and if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now has God said the members every one of them in the body as it has pleased him and if they were all one member then where were the body amen I came to just imagine a hand going down through there just just an arm and a hand that's it that's the whole body and just crawling around trying to get around if it was all just an arm and a hand if that's all it was is what he's saying but would the body be what good would that do huh if everything was just ahead that's all you'd see well it's just a head floating head no arms and legs be bad wouldn't it all right he says but now there are many members yet why amen how many Blues were one and the eye cannot say to the hand I have no need of thee nor again to head unto defeat I have no need to be now what is he trying to say sometimes we think well we don't need that person we don't need that person we don't need that person in the church that person boy he's so different you know I don't I don't really like his personality I don't you know come on you need a good old-fashioned prayer meeting thank God everybody's not like you because I'm somebody come up smack you because they don't like the way you are foreign that's right and those members of the body which we think are less honorable upon those please bestowed a more abundant honor and our comedy Parts have more abundant calmness for our commonly Parts have no need but God has tempered the body together having given an abundant honor in that part which lack that there should be no Chisholm in the body but that the members should have the same Care at one for the other amen I mean no you find out that you have an appendix that's being bad or you have something else or liver something's going wrong but I'll tell you what you're not going to focus on your head you're not going to go to the ear doctor you're not going to go to the eye doctor you're going to go to the liver doctor why you focus on what is hurting there and that's the way it is we ought to take care Bible says that we ought to love one another like that that when one's hurting they all hurt we all fear for that one person amen all right and whether one member suffered a man all members suffer with it or one member Beyond it all members Rejoice with it for ye are the body of Christ and members in particular praise the Lords how many knows we all have our place foreign this is what I want to say whatever God has blessed you in use that blessing to be edifying to the rest of the body and to the body I mean to the kingdom of God amen whatever he has bless you in it use it for the body of Christ and for the kingdom of God that's the way God intended it for to be [Music] amen if you don't know for sure what you are what you should do hang around a while God will direct you amen one thing that prophet of God taught us that if you have a gift I don't care if it's for preaching or what it is God Will Make A Way for that gift they'll make a way for it if you don't make a way for it then maybe you're not called because God will open the doors for you amen he'll make a way for that gift amen all right praise the Lord so we see that we're a body now brother random this is if we're going to go in closing perhaps or count towards the end of it but we're going to talk a little bit about what weather brandom it is letter to the church a scripture and the quote that we have read many times and I want to say this as a pastor this this scripture has been read many times across the pulpit here in the little church down there and a lot of us haven't heard it maybe not us but people haven't we got to hear it I mean it's when the voice of gods be it's important that you hear it's important that it goes down in there and I look at this and I think this ought to be hung on our wall somewhere amenities quotes because I believe it was called a letter to the church it was quote the brother Banner made about the protection how we keep the devil up how did we keep the unity of the faith have I read that scripture yet I haven't read that yet Ephesians 4 says I therefore a prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all loneliness and meekness with long suffering putting up with each other forbearing one another in love I mean those it's not always not and they don't always go perfect there'll be people that say a little something or do something that you don't like or that's offensive that has to be dealt with forgiven or taken care of or whatever amen but we have to forbear one another this just comes well I hope I don't forget it but I want to say this at the right time for bearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace and if I was going to title this anything else it would have been keeping the unity of the spirit keeping the Oneness keeping the unity of the spirit there is one body amen I'm going to be there's one body not two not 900 one there's one body and it isn't just this is a local body I mean as we're a local body this is this isn't all of the body of Christ amen and I don't know how many in here are part of this body huh I trust we all are hope we all confessing to be Christians and if not then you wouldn't be you know a part of the body of Christ maybe not everybody is I don't know only let me say this only God knows yeah only God knows you don't even have to try to figure that one out he did there's one body and one spirit oh my I love that how we could take that and talk about you know if we're all uh uh you know we were all in Fellowship I'm with another if we're baptized into the body if God how many believes the Holy Spirit has fellowship with the Holy Spirit absolutely when people get baptized with the Holy Ghost you have Fellowship one with another can I say something I don't know why I say that but I do just a bad habit I'm gonna say it anyway anyway right if I don't forget before I do all that if we don't have Fellowship there's something wrong there's something wrong if we don't have Fellowship something wrong because if you're in the same body I'm in you have the same spirit I have you're going the Bible says you're going to have Fellowship one with another [Music] and I believe we ought to have Fellowship how many believe that we ought to have Fellowship one with another we had a fellowship together can I say something else a church group that can hang out together fellowship with one another there's something wrong huh you got a little bitterness you got a little problem or you just got a problem with what this one says or you don't like the way he says it I don't know but you shouldn't have we should have Fellowship one with another I know pastors that have told me you know it's important and I believe it it's important for us to have Fellowship together you know we I miss our fellowship meetings in there and our carry-ins don't you amen by the way um how how may like to have a first Sunday carry in with a minister coming in for two Services somebody like to do that come on now folks every hand if not you're in trouble because I've done got it scheduled that's right praise the Lord [Applause] Amen Brother Bill Hershberger is going to be with us the first weekend in November amen we're going to have a some morning service because I ain't gonna bring nobody from that far not have two services amen so we'll have Sunday morning and we're going to have communion like we usually do on Sunday morning and keep that keep that like it is have Fellowship dinner and then an evening service and I'll talk to the deacons we'll decide maybe three o'clock you know not to wait too late maybe a three o'clock service as soon as we get done eating you know you won't have time for a nap but we'll have have that amen Lord willing and I thought it might be good I just prayed about it and I thought that might be a good way to do it amen and so forth because I do want to have other ministers in and so forth and if I'm not far off and so sometimes we'll maybe do that okay all right now so we see that we're a local body body of Christ we know where it is I'm in knows where the body of Christ is that it's Universal people in Africa in the uh Indonesia I don't care where you are I don't care if you're in China speaking Chinese if they're baptized with the Holy Ghost you're in the same body that you're in they're your brothers and they're your sisters I don't care Creed race or what it is amen oh my this just comes to mind you know because of what's going around but you know it is pathetic we think it's very pathetic how to how that their the homosexuals now are getting to our kids not ours but the world's kids I mean it was in Sodom and Gomorrah they pushed themselves upon the whole city even to even to lot and so forth and that's what's that's the agenda that's going on they aren't happy with just you know you know coming out no now they want to go into your schools and they want to molest your children pedophiles all of that they're trying to get that to be okay and stuff it's just terrible mix them all up but you know I thought about this is what I thought and perhaps didn't finish here a while ago and that is as we see the world and how it's going you know it's plain to see that but my question is do you see what God is doing God is doing something in his people this morning he's doing something and I don't know if you can see it in somebody else or not but I hope that you can see God working in your life that he is getting you ready to meet him he is bringing you to Oneness with him to join him in the air as the world is getting more departs and more crooked and more filthy you're getting older you're getting cleaner you're becoming more like him you're thinking more like him are you with me because we're going to leave this place one of these days and God is going to have that church and it's going to be without spot amen and it's going to be without wrinkle and it's gonna be without any such thing or any blemish how many believe that he's getting us ready amen I believe that he's getting us ready to be an invincible Army how many wants to get to a place to where the devil can't touch you yeah I want to get to a place where the devil don't know what to do with me he don't know what to do with you oh my praise be the guy we're getting to that place I feel it amen I can I I know God you know he's working in my life I hope he's working I trusted he's working in yours and that you recognize that those sufferings and those trials and those things that come your way that is for your good and it is to bring you closer to Christ because remember that nobody ever got character outside outside of suffering outside of being tested and tried well you know this layout is here Millennials we realize that the generation we're dealing with is people like brother Brian says you know when they don't know what it's like not to have an iPod the event is all easy and what does easy bring laziness at lukewarmness that's what it produces war and hardship bring character and we ain't had none of that in a long time and that's why we're dealing with more than ever a laodicea age lukewarm no good no character but I'm called a characterless age amen brother Irvin Martha different ones of us we worked hard we learned how to work hard struggle and so forth we were taught that's why we are and that's why we are where we are amen you know I I've been wanting to say something about somebody and I'm going to do it right here right now I feel the anointing it's gonna be a flower to somebody and I hope they don't get upset but I'm gonna you know the hardest woman will hardest working woman that I know loves her family loves the Lord I know Mars the hall Burger might as a hobby she is let's give her a hand we appreciate it amen [Applause] I know Irvin does too hey man that we've watched her in her life coming up from Florida and amen just living that on that side of that Hill living in a little Shack on the side of the Hill they dug themselves out of there and looking for a day at today praise be to God Amen God's blessed them amen I wanted to say that for a long time to give her that flower in heaven amen because she deserves a lot of credit praise the Lord now are you ready time's going slow for some reason but that's all right usually time flies when you're having a good time all right letter to the church put your guard up brother Branham had dealt with things and he knew what it takes to hold a group together to keep the devil out huh keep evil away he says it now do you remember that the enemy will come right and what he does just bring that much closer together I mean knows that's a military when the enemy comes when they start shooting just get closer together isn't that right buying together love one another even more amen and I'm going to stop there and pick this back up first he said in Christ the mystery of Christ is a mystery of God reveal love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil does and tries we've been talking about the devil a lot lately haven't we Wednesday and last Sunday better brother Brian whatever he tries now you're all one big sweet group now huh how many loves it when it's what makes this like your family just like your home husband and wife man it is nothing sweeter but the devil don't like that how many times he wants to bring a foot he wants to bring something division he wants to cause some difference the kids having fun together playing together he don't like that he wants to fight him get him to fight over a toy well for those adults it's just big toys or gifts or something else we fuss about all right no no sweet group now and remember my warning Satan won't let you stay that way in other words he's going to try to get in somehow he's gonna try to take your joy from you thank you amen Satan won't let you say that but no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target now when I underline that because this is what I thought about we as a group Brother Brad I know you brother Brad I know your heart's desires it's a Joyce your family it meant all of us we know each other don't we do we know each other we get to play together we get to pray together we get the church together we interact with each other we know how each other are don't we so we should be able to tell whether this is a good guy or whether it is not a good guy huh and like brother Benham says as long as we have taken communion together we broke bread together and then all of a sudden one fusses with the other huh and he says now notice it's not Leo and it's not Gene right but it's the devil sometimes it gets in Among Us but I want you to know as your pastor it's important that you believe that your brother is good that your sister's good that they're not normally this way they don't normally act this way so it's not them it's the devil [Music] not as a pastor I know this and if somebody continuously does it there's something wrong there you better watch that person you may not want to go to eat with that person don't hang with that person don't listen to that person don't you take sides with them do you even just don't even get in here and his deadly stuff huh you got to know these things amen that's why he says he'll have to if you have to bring somebody else in we all know that somebody else come to church here we want to get to know him huh go out to eat with them gossip with him a little bit huh gossip with him yeah it's gonna feel out see if he gossip or she gossip huh maybe you don't want to do that but still you want to find out they jump on the bandwagon and boys start railing he says well brother I don't really I don't really mean that I'm sorry I didn't say that about him huh we what my point is we know we need to know that we're all and I believe this this is what I've thank God for you get on my knees and thank God that God has given me holy ghost-filled people Holy Ghost Field church people that love the Lord I don't know any of you that's evil I don't know any in here that doesn't want to make heaven huh I thank God for for what I'm about to read and so forth and and and the peace that the Lord has given the evening that Tabernacle the unity the Oneness that we have now I say this because we know that you know it's you know the devil's always going to try isn't it he's always going to try my my I'm not I wouldn't say all the things that I've seen and the things that I know but this I know the devil don't give up you'll keep trying and I've tried my best to teach y'all where he comes in at and how he comes in that because you're the one that has to stop him I can't be there to stop him you have to be there to stop him he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in huh critic critic is something that somebody that's critical right criticizes how many knows buddy I'll tell you what if you come here this morning to criticize a preacher you probably already got about half a dozen maybe two dozen I don't know things are criticize me about well he shouldn't have said that and you know probably did I don't know but listen give you something to criticize about so notice and set him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness of things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll go through the church with it huh not don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you just stay loving and sweet because I'm in those if he's telling you to say loving is sweet there's others probably being bitterness malice in something besides sweetness and loving is what it's bringing in that's how the devil tries to get in and amongst your ranks he tries to break the ranks get them Shields onto the side now all you gotta do is let down your ear one time to listen all you gotta do is to listen to gossip and I I I want to say this while it comes to mind but better man I'm talking about he says you don't even want any funny feelings are you with me in other words be so guarded have that wall up so hard be so one until you won't even let a funny feeling come into my heart because you know if you get a funny feeling towards somebody it goes more than just a funny feeling that person don't like me huh you know and and it goes from there or it tries to go underneath something happens in the root of bitterness Creeps in underneath and he's files many of the Bible says a root of bitterness folks how many knows let me tell you something Devil is a master at it if a pastor doesn't hit this once in a while and hard maybe all the time like I do a lot the devil will try to creep in amen don't have nothing to do with anything else say sweet and kind but pray for that man that he'll be saved to or woman forever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor huh stay with your pastor because he's the shepherd and he'd give him respects he'll lead you through he's ordained of God to do so now you remember that the enemy will come but when he does you cling that much closer to one another and the one that the devil is using for an enemy and I know he's talking about the devil right they will try to use somebody use the foreign enemy will either get out or come in and be one with you uh you know you ain't got to tell somebody very often don't talk to me about that stuff or I don't hear it in most people that's the last time you're gonna have any problems having to listen to it but sometimes that's what you got to say I don't want to hear don't tell me about that stuff don't be ought to be going around talking well that really squirts them a little and if I find out you are I'm gonna let this faster now [Music] why because of random new the shrewdness of the devil he knew how he would come in amen and what he'd do all right now notice here's another thought that's all and don't never Clan amongst yourselves or make yourself clannish now usually in a small group like this most of us we aren't we don't have the hall Beggars or hershbergers over here and this one over there and that one over here and they don't barely talk to each other I believe that's what he was talking about in other words don't get on to your little clicks isn't that right no Clicks in the church now we know that brother Donnie Reagan a lot of those churches no doubt they got their clicks can't help but help there's certain people that are going out with certain people to eat and they don't never even know the other people exist probably it's much harder to have everybody in unity like that you're going to have perhaps more than what you would in a small group amen but anyway okay so now notice so he says don't ever let's just make don't make yourself that way he says better man because we are one that's what I want to say how many please let's all say it we are one We Are One see the left hand can't say I'm mad at you I'm gonna take you away huh let's never think evil about one another or that the other person's evil let's not believe that because brother Brown says if the devil can get you to believe that her brother and sister is evil he's got you right there you won't have any confidence in them and so forth amen so you don't want to think that you always want to believe the best and now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on discipline of the church amen how many glad that you can come into the house of God and you can sit and when not everybody's yelling and screaming and talking to each other everywhere you can something you can pray read your Bible or whatever he's got a discipline of the church and so forth oh my and I'm going to read this whole thing is that okay before we close I was going to close 10 minutes ago well not close but wind down we're still winding down now notice so he says you come here together to sit together in Heavenly places together tell me Tommy loves to come to church [Music] is the best place you know you you do create a nice I'm sure that you fathers create a nice atmosphere in your home is that right you do probably but there's something about church when everything else is laid aside and the whole family comes together we sit still We Worship the Lord we praise the lord we amen hallelujah glory to God hallelujah [Music] we just have a good old Heavenly Time this is nothing as good as Church it's like what was it somebody said it brother Brad I believe it was last Sunday it strengthens you that's where you get your strength and so forth amen how many thought about it Brad did a wonderful job last night you're really good really good amen amen praise the Lord he always tells me he says boy you've been about it you did good the last time we did this you know when he does good I need to tell him to amen because he does we appreciate him yeah amen each and every one of us amen don't stay up and I noticed in Heavenly places don't stay home yeah don't stay home Church if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open up yonder to get into fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way this is Brother random not Thomas Butler this is our Prophet you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you pray it's time that you go to pray because we're in the last days and the Bible exhorted us that as we see that day approaching that we ought to love one another and assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and to love one another for by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another amen let's give the Lord Jesus bless your name Lord Hallelujah praise the Lord amen how many wants to worship let's worship bring that song up there with you into musicians if you'll come thank you all so much I can't wait to read it read every name amen God bless you amen let's sing Onward Christian Soldiers marching as to who are amen how many believes we're Christian soldiers fighting the devil and we're keeping him out of our Lives keeping out of your individual life keeping it out of the church out of as a group amen and be one with the help of the Lord amen I'll help sing this song and then we'll turn it over Better Days I think that is that's I think my eyes have seen the glory of God um Onward Christian Soldiers yeah that's a different one than I told you hanana I think I told her but she said to battle him of the Republic and I said yeah that's it I don't think it is [Music]
