[0:00] was made up here out of one out of a
[0:02] million I want an honor that is but
[0:05] outside of the second birth the first
[0:07] the first verse is nothing but of course
[0:10] it had really been better if it wasn't
[0:11] born the first time if you ain't born
[0:13] again the second time
[0:17] so when you think about what God has
[0:19] done for doing oh yes it's in your heart
[0:22] hey man you wanna love him and serve him
[0:24] and worship him and then he started
[0:25] something in there it causes you to
[0:28] bless the Lord
[0:31] amen I thought about titling this
[0:33] according to the song we want to sing at
[0:34] the end of service 10 000 reasons for my
[0:37] heart to sing
[0:39] ten thousand reasons to bless a lot
[0:45] my
[0:47] I wish I had
[0:48] that was just at the brains it's just to
[0:51] tell all of the all about ten thousands
[0:54] but I just mentioned a few things we
[0:56] Rejoice over those few things Zoe
[0:59] he choses you the first time he chose
[1:01] you the second time he gave me the new
[1:03] birth he gave me the desire of your
[1:04] heart he put something in there to want
[1:07] to serve him to want to love him
[1:09] that's Grace that's the God's blessing
[1:11] to you
[1:12] oh may I rebound that to almighty God
[1:15] say now let me bless you Lord let me
[1:18] praise you with my life let me praise
[1:20] you with everything I do let me praise
[1:22] you with my thoughts let me praise you
[1:23] with my life
[1:24] let me Praise You My Strength let me
[1:26] glorify you in everything
[1:29] everybody said
[1:31] and that your heart desire Lord help me
[1:33] to bless you and Praise You In
[1:35] Everything
[1:38] amen
[1:41] let everything that has breath praise
[1:43] the Lord
[1:44] he's worthy of praise and he's worthy of
[1:47] thanks I mean please he's worthy of
[1:49] Thanksgiving
[1:51] people don't thank God they're not
[1:52] thankful for God for what he has done or
[1:54] for what he has made
[1:56] but the Bride of Jesus Christ amen they
[1:58] cry out he's saying he's worthy of
[2:00] Thanksgiving remember there was ten
[2:02] lepers that were healed and only one
[2:05] came back and God Jesus said where's the
[2:07] other nine
[2:08] only one came back but glorify God
[2:13] and to praise him and to worship Him
[2:15] that's about how it is one out of a
[2:18] million
[2:18] that really come back and give God glory
[2:21] and praise the rest of them they say
[2:25] it's sad the rest of them even deny
[2:28] their creator
[2:29] they deny that God made him
[2:33] and you know I had to think sister
[2:34] Jeanette I thought you know if I made
[2:35] something that which I made would deny
[2:38] that I made it
[2:40] probably just burn it
[2:42] I destroyed you want to be that
[2:43] rebellious
[2:45] you want to say I didn't make you you
[2:46] don't deserve to exist
[2:50] know what God's going to do he's going
[2:52] to cause them to cease to exist he's
[2:54] going to destroy those who deny that he
[2:56] made him
[2:58] why God doesn't let me just said God
[3:00] does not get the respect that he
[3:03] deserves does he
[3:05] no he doesn't he doesn't get the respect
[3:07] that he deserves
[3:10] what a world we're living in what a
[3:13] bunch of human beings
[3:16] amen I was talking to that one man
[3:18] yesterday and I told him I said look at
[3:20] what we've done you know how far it's
[3:22] gone he says yeah that's right look at
[3:23] how far it's gone
[3:24] you know and I said look how evil it's
[3:27] gotten and I said said to him you know
[3:29] it's almost gotten to where the Lord
[3:31] probably God almost probably back at the
[3:33] place he was in the days of Noah that he
[3:35] repented him that he made man
[3:39] repented him that he made man
[3:42] whew
[3:46] in other words what did I do did I mess
[3:49] up
[3:51] huh
[3:53] well there's a lot that he
[3:56] you know has the question but there's a
[3:57] lot he don't he knew I mean he knows God
[4:00] knew who he would he he God is not the
[4:02] kind of God that starts something don't
[4:03] know what he's doing he knows exactly
[4:05] what he's doing
[4:07] but the thing about God is he wants
[4:09] everybody to be saved
[4:11] he wants everybody to come to him and he
[4:13] gives everybody that opportunity to come
[4:15] to him
[4:17] but the desire is not in their heart to
[4:19] do so
[4:20] because they're of the wrong lineage as
[4:22] you and I know
[4:24] amen Simon remember remembered Bible
[4:26] says he came to his own and his own
[4:28] received him not his own children were
[4:31] the ones that put him on the cross isn't
[4:32] that right
[4:33] his own called his own people put him on
[4:36] that cross away with him away with him
[4:38] crucifying crucifying after watching
[4:40] Lazarus come back from the dead the
[4:43] blinded eyes open and also for back then
[4:46] no that was in our generation Jesus
[4:49] would come and open the eyes of the
[4:51] Blind and discern the thoughts and
[4:52] intents of the heart those Pentecostal
[4:54] preachers would say if you go to their
[4:55] meetings we'll excommunicate you from
[4:57] our church
[5:00] one of them said you know I'll stop so
[5:02] and so was over on your platform now
[5:04] we're gonna have to take him off the
[5:05] book
[5:06] he won't make it to Heaven boy brother
[5:08] Adam hung up holding up on him you mean
[5:10] to tell me you're a minister of the
[5:11] gospel and you don't know any more about
[5:13] the God than that no wonder he says
[5:15] there's millions and billions of
[5:17] so-called Christians no more no more
[5:19] about God than a Hot and Hot knows about
[5:20] an Egyptian Knight
[5:22] claim to serve Jesus Christ but there he
[5:25] was doing the same thing they don't even
[5:26] know who he is
[5:28] that's the blindness isn't it
[5:30] oh folks let me tell you something I've
[5:32] dealt with a little bit of blindness in
[5:34] people and if you get a spirit on you
[5:36] and you get a wrong Spirit on you that
[5:38] spirit will make you believe that you
[5:40] are right 100 percent
[5:42] and you won't be wanting to give any you
[5:44] won't want to have no questions that I'm
[5:46] right or wrong huh
[5:49] and that's what real blindness comes in
[5:52] a real and that's the way it fares these
[5:54] were they didn't want to even hear that
[5:55] they were wrong if Dana just said maybe
[5:57] I'm wrong God could have maybe work with
[5:59] him
[6:00] amen but it's a spirit that blinds
[6:03] people
[6:04] and the God does not get treated the way
[6:07] that he should and
[6:09] amen
[6:11] we want to treat him right don't we
[6:14] amen the unwelcome Christ but the Bam's
[6:16] talking about that that Pharisee did not
[6:17] welcome him did not entertain him he
[6:20] says I wonder how much we entertain
[6:22] Christ
[6:23] how much we give back to him and glorify
[6:25] him and entertain him
[6:27] or do we do like the Pharisees we're so
[6:29] busy with the big shots and the
[6:30] highfalutinas and this that or the other
[6:32] or our work or our this that or the
[6:34] other
[6:35] we say Lord I need more of you I want
[6:38] you to come into my life and when he
[6:39] does you don't even recognize it folks
[6:41] When you pray God I need more of you you
[6:43] better watch out tomorrow somehow or
[6:45] other God's going to try to come and see
[6:46] you he'll come and visit you because he
[6:48] always goes where he's invited let me
[6:49] believe that Jesus he did with time and
[6:51] Simon hears this he says man we need to
[6:54] we fail to entertain him
[6:56] how many believes that I don't care what
[6:58] it is entertain him thank you Hallelujah
[7:01] you're worthy of Praise entertain the
[7:02] Lord I don't care what you do for
[7:05] Christ anything God recognizes he sees
[7:08] it
[7:09] amen
[7:10] amen praise the Lord hallelujah that's
[7:13] right entertain the Lord don't let him
[7:14] sit there with 30 feet unentertained
[7:19] amen
[7:21] oh my okay
[7:25] we got to
[7:26] two o'clock amen we always have a lot of
[7:29] a lot of spare time in between amen
[7:32] so we'll just take our time
[7:35] let's go on though
[7:37] I love that look at he began to talk
[7:39] about bless the Lord talk about Abraham
[7:41] and the blessing that came with Abraham
[7:43] now we want to go to Psalms 34 talk
[7:46] about David here
[7:52] Psalm 34. I Will Bless The Lord once in
[7:57] a while
[7:58] no at all times
[8:04] folks I want to say something we may not
[8:06] have the gifts of speaking in tongues we
[8:07] need men out of this out of the other
[8:09] but I'd like to see a whole congregation
[8:11] what's so important is that every one of
[8:12] us has the right attitude
[8:15] that right a positive attitude of
[8:17] praising the Lord
[8:19] that's the best thing we could have is a
[8:20] attitude of love in our hearts towards
[8:23] God Amen and that we would praise the
[8:26] Lord and bless the Lord at all times his
[8:30] praise shall continually be in my mouth
[8:36] my soul shall make her boast in what I
[8:39] can do
[8:40] no my my soul shall make her both in the
[8:45] Lord
[8:46] The Humble shall hear thereof and be
[8:49] glad oh magnify the Lord with me amen
[8:53] for he is worthy to be praised and let
[8:57] us exalt his name together David said
[8:59] that's where we get that song Amen
[9:02] I sought the Lord and he heard me and
[9:06] delivered me from all of my fears
[9:09] Glory aren't you glad that God delivers
[9:11] you it is God delivers you from all of
[9:14] your fear you can't deliver yourself why

[9:44] enlightened and their faces were not
[9:46] ashamed this small poor man cried and
[9:49] the Lord heard him and saved him
[9:52] out of all of his troubles
[9:56] oh has the Lord ever delivered you out
[9:59] of all your troubles this morning

[10:05] of the Lord and Camp was round about you
[10:08] and I that fear Him to deliver them how
[10:12] many blades Deliverance is of the Lord
[10:14] salvation is of the Lord
[10:18] go back a little bit to the last
[10:19] Wednesday's service I guess it was amen
[10:22] preaching on salvation I didn't go into
[10:23] Nicodemus not Nicodemus but into soccer
[10:26] Zacchaeus up in the tree and he says he
[10:29] just today I'm going to your house today
[10:30] and Jackie has been a tax collector he
[10:33] said you know because he was probably a
[10:35] little crooked even on behalf of
[10:36] everything back that ever took a man up
[10:38] here all of it back and then Jesus
[10:40] turned says today salvation has come to
[10:43] your house
[10:44] how many believes today in this thing
[10:47] salvation came to this generation
[10:51] don't pass goodbye
[10:53] Hallelujah
[10:55] the angel of the Lord in Camp was wrong
[10:57] about them that fear Him to deliver them
[10:59] oh taste and seed at the Lord is good

[11:04] it is the man that trusts Us in him when
[11:08] you put your trust in him you are gonna
[11:10] be blessed
[11:16] I don't care what it is I don't care who
[11:17] it is young people
[11:19] if you don't taste not just taste
[11:21] because people just get a little taste
[11:23] and know that the Lord is good but
[11:25] something has to happen way down in here
[11:27] but one thing's for sure it is good to
[11:30] be a Christian
[11:32] if you don't find that it's the best
[11:33] thing in the world you need a real
[11:35] experience with God
[11:36] because something out there is going to
[11:39] look better
[11:40] and you're going to be this Gravely
[11:42] disappointed
[11:45] amen
[11:46] aren't you glad that you know
[11:49] oh fear the lord ye hear Saints for
[11:51] there is no want to them
[11:54] that fear Him amen remember a long time
[11:56] ago I've preached on Thou shalt not want
[11:59] that's applied everything that you ever
[12:01] have in this world or in the world to
[12:03] come when he gave to the Holy Ghost
[12:06] there's no want for them that fear Him
[12:08] amen oh you might think oh I need this
[12:10] that no he supplied it for you it's
[12:12] there if you
[12:13] just believe it amen
[12:16] the Young Lions do lack and suffer
[12:18] hunger but they that seek the Lord shall
[12:20] not want any good thing come your
[12:23] children hearken unto me and I will
[12:24] teach you to fear the lord
[12:26] amen what man now notice this goes over
[12:28] in the New Testament what man is he that
[12:30] desire of life and live loveth many days
[12:34] that he may see good
[12:36] keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips
[12:39] from speaking God that's in Peter I
[12:41] believe it is amen how many bees that oh
[12:44] my what's your tongue depart from Evil
[12:47] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[12:49] depart from Evil and do good seek peace
[12:52] and pursue it very very quotations of
[12:54] the New Testament
[12:56] the eyes of the Lord are upon the
[12:58] righteous and his ears are open to their
[13:01] cry
[13:02] come on people how many believe that God
[13:06] hears your cry God's ears are open to
[13:10] you
[13:13] he's not deaf to your Christ
[13:16] to your calls but the face of the Lord
[13:18] is against them that do evil
[13:21] to cut off the remembrance of them from
[13:23] the earth amen the righteous cry and the
[13:27] Lord heareth and delivereth them out of
[13:29] all of their troubles
[13:33] amen
[13:35] how many believe that for Christians
[13:37] there's still much trouble that lays
[13:40] ahead
[13:41] we don't know what kind of trouble lays
[13:43] ahead
[13:44] huh
[13:45] but like sister shares this it doesn't
[13:47] matter
[13:48] we know the one that's going to deliver
[13:50] us
[13:51] and you know the one that's going to
[13:53] deliver us so you don't worry about the
[13:54] troubles we know the one that takes care
[13:57] of our troubles
[13:59] amen the Lord is not unto them that are
[14:01] of a broken heart and save as such that
[14:03] be of a contrite spirit many are the
[14:06] afflictions of the righteous
[14:09] hey man let me tell you something but
[14:12] the Lord delivers them out of them all
[14:15] amen
[14:16] we could read that
[14:18] for those who serve the devil many are
[14:20] the afflictions of sinners
[14:23] but the devil doesn't deliver them out
[14:25] of any
[14:26] you know right
[14:28] that's right he can't deliver he's not a
[14:30] delivery he keepeth his bones and none
[14:32] of them is broken talking about Christ
[14:34] amen praise the Lord
[14:36] turn to another one 103.
[14:39] Psalms 103.
[14:43] amen we got about three more to go
[14:48] Psalms 103
[14:51] bless the Lord
[14:53] oh my soul and all that is within me
[14:59] amen bless His
[15:02] holy name
[15:05] sing it with me that's right how many
[15:07] believe that isn't that wonderful
[15:10] our very songs come from this bless
[15:13] my soul and forget not all
[15:18] that you want to have a doula
[15:22] Jubilee of being Christian
[15:24] oh my just go ahead and get your big old
[15:26] tablet like this right here amen like I
[15:29] did one count your blessings name them
[15:30] one by one get your big old tablet see
[15:32] how many things that are benefit
[15:36] a benefit of the Lord
[15:38] bless the Lord and forget not all of his
[15:40] benefits that's why we bless him is
[15:43] because he's given us all these benefits
[15:46] praise be to God
[15:49] amen
[15:50] the benefit of having a shield the
[15:53] benefit of having an angel camped around
[15:55] about you amen ain't no devil can touch
[15:58] you ain't nobody that can do nothing and
[16:00] nothing can touch you on Sudden has
[16:02] permission by almighty God
[16:05] oh on and on we could go but we're not
[16:08] preaching that this morning
[16:11] forgive us
[16:17] it is the man to whom God will not
[16:19] impute sin
[16:22] over in the New Testament
[16:24] I thought you know thank you Lord Glory
[16:26] let me bless your name for you have
[16:28] forgiven me all of my iniquities
[16:32] every one of us probably can say you
[16:34] know there's things I knew I shouldn't
[16:36] do but I did that was inequity but if
[16:39] you repent say God forgive me he has
[16:41] forgiven you of all your inequity bless
[16:45] His holy name
[16:49] amen
[16:51] Hallelujah
[16:54] aren't you glad for that
[16:56] who healeth all thy diseases how many of
[17:01] those he healing belongs to him you
[17:04] don't get no healing unless he gives it
[17:06] to you
[17:09] oh my one time somebody tried to say
[17:12] that uh you know the devil heals the
[17:14] devil can't heal nobody
[17:16] because of this scripture right here if
[17:18] you get healed in any form or fashion I
[17:20] don't care if it's just your body of
[17:21] healing itself that was God putting that
[17:24] in there
[17:25] he's the one that heals all your
[17:27] diseases
[17:29] Glory
[17:31] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[17:35] amen who Crown a thief with loving
[17:38] kindness and Tender Mercies
[17:41] be kindly affectionate one to another be
[17:44] kind amen how many knows it's a whole
[17:47] like
[17:48] those that makes you kind because in
[17:50] this world it's easy to get really
[17:53] really mean
[17:55] huh
[17:56] that's right before you know it you'd
[17:58] have all kinds of road rage and all
[18:00] kinds of other rages if it wasn't for
[18:02] God
[18:03] but he crowneth thee with loving
[18:06] kindness and Tender Mercies
[18:09] but this just comes to mind but Abraham
[18:11] says don't let me cry don't let the
[18:13] devil Crown my old age my life with
[18:15] being a grouchy old man or a grumpy old
[18:18] lady isn't that right
[18:19] that's right who satisfy at thy mouth
[18:23] with good things so that thy youth is
[18:26] renewed like the eagles
[18:30] [Applause]
[18:33] I'm really glad that you can feel young
[18:35] when you're old
[18:36] if you're a Christian you got the Holy
[18:39] Ghost you can feel young even though if
[18:41] you're old
[18:42] praise be Lord
[18:44] Hallelujah
[18:47] oh my
[18:50] just getting old it's depressing enough
[18:52] you need something to encourage you
[18:54] amen
[18:57] sorry the Lord is merciful
[19:01] first I missed one the Lord executed his
[19:04] righteousness and judgment for all that
[19:06] are oppressed he made known his ways
[19:09] unto Moses his acts unto the children of
[19:11] Israel the Lord is merciful and gracious
[19:13] slow to anger and plentyth in Mercy he
[19:16] will not always child need to really
[19:17] keep his anger forever and here's what I
[19:20] like also I just want to pick this up
[19:23] he hath not dealt with us after our sins
[19:28] amen
[19:31] how many believes that how what if he
[19:33] actually dealt with you according to
[19:35] your sin you wouldn't be alive would you
[19:38] you would be dead
[19:40] no reward is according no rewarded us
[19:44] according to our iniquities
[19:46] amen
[19:56] all right
[20:01] where was it somewhere ironed
[20:04] where well let me go on I think it may
[20:06] be yeah here here's one here's a thought
[20:08] I was trying to think of a previous
[20:10] scripture
[20:11] where he talks about he don't hold our
[20:14] sins against us
[20:16] amen
[20:18] and I thought you know because if he did
[20:19] it would be like
[20:21] you know what it's like to hold

[32:41] Lord Lord and we trust each one it is a
[32:44] part of you father that we're all a part
[32:45] of you Lord
[32:47] we ask you to bless it now in Jesus name
[32:49] amen and amen First Corinthians 11 and
[32:54] verse 23.
[32:56] Paul says for I have received of the
[32:58] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[33:00] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[33:02] in which he was betrayed to read
[33:05] when he had given thanks he break it and
[33:07] said take eat this is my body which is
[33:09] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[33:12] me after the same manner also he took
[33:14] the cup and when he had stopped saying
[33:16] this cup is the New Testament in my
[33:17] blood this through he as often as he
[33:19] drink it in remembrance of me for as
[33:22] often as he eat this bread and drink of
[33:23] this cup he do show the Lord's death
[33:26] till he come wherefore whosoever shall
[33:28] he give this bread and drink of this cup
[33:29] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[33:32] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[33:34] let a man examine himself and so let him
[33:36] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[33:38] for he that eateth and drinketh and
[33:40] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[33:43] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[33:45] body and for this cause many are weak
[33:47] and sickly among you from many sleep for
[33:49] if we would judge ourselves we should
[33:51] not be judged but when we are judged we
[33:53] are chasing the Lord
[33:55] that we should not be condemned with the
[33:57] world wherefore my brethren when ye come
[33:59] together to eat Terry one for another
[34:01] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[34:03] home that you come not together unto
[34:05] condemnation and the rest will I said in
[34:07] order when I come we like to have a
[34:10] moment of silence so that you can
[34:11] examine yourself
[34:13] amen before you eat of that bread and
[34:15] drink of that cup
[34:35] amen amen all those that want to partake
[34:38] of the communion come over around this
[34:39] side the rest can be seated
