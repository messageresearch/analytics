brother russell on them here we've asked him to heal come and sing this morning always glad to be greeted his family my brother david you feel that way some disadvantages of that when you're a guest everybody treats you really nice when your family maybe they don't but you can still treat us nice we'll be fine for the david i need to know that when i come here he's going to ask me to sing be prepared but i never am but i'll just remind you of an old hymn this morning wrote in 1863 on christ the solid rock i stand but this came so real to me just a couple months ago we were here and at the church but i'm speaking on perfection and i thought this is a quote i should print and just have it on the fridge it's kind of one of those cornerstone quotes brother branham and then it just brought to my mind this song that my hope is built on nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness but abraham says that my salvation and yours tonight does not hinge upon the merits of our own acts it's hinged upon the posit positive sovereign grace of almighty god who has chosen us in him certainly i could never be perfect nor you could never be perfect and we don't claim to be perfect but we have this one consolation that our faith rests in a perfect sacrifice that's already been received amen my hopes built on nothing less keep f probably [Music] my hope is built on nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness i dare not trust the sweetest frame but holy on jesus name on christ the solid rock i stand all of the ground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking sand when darkness seems to hide his face i rest on his unchanging grace in every high and stormy gill my anchor holds within the veil his old his covenant and his blood support me in the well-mean flood when all around my soul gives way he then is all my hope and stay on christ the solid rochester and all of the ground is seeking sand all other ground sinking sand when he shall come with trumpet sound oh may i then in him be found dressed in his righteousness alone faultless to stand before the throne on christ the solid rock i stand all other ground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking [Laughter] sand amen aren't you glad that in a world that's falling apart we're up on a solid rock this morning amen did sister glover come in or she in the back oh she's not with him oh okay i guess i didn't i didn't read that very well all right well that's not nothing new let's stand this morning appreciate that song god bless you let's stand and ask for the andrew it's a privilege to have brother andrew

god praise god praise god praise god praise god it's god praise god amen you love him this morning and we know the only reason we're here is because of his grace amen if it wasn't for the grace of god we could just stop this morning and think about where we would be and when i start thinking about that i don't want to be there amen i'm glad to be here this morning and i want to greet you in the name of the lord sure get to see everyone out this morning in the house of god and i know we're sure living in different times aren't we times of confusion and times of uncertainty but i'm glad this morning the word still remains the same amen amen let's just buy our hearts together for a word of prayer before we open the word and let's just ask the lord to come and speak to us this morning heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered here today lord we don't gather here under a tradition or under ritual lord or lord under just another form or another service the lord we gather here this morning because there is a deep calling to the deep there is lord of voice on the inside of us that's calling out for more of you and lord we know that your prophet has taught us that if there wasn't more of you for us and there wouldn't be something on the inside of us calling out for more of you and father this morning i pray as we gather here today as the songs of zion have been sung lord as the words of exhortation have gone forth and an atmosphere has been created i pray this morning oh god may the angels just be dispatched into this building lord may you drive back every spirit of unbelief may you drive back every hindrance this morning lord we know that your prophet has told us that no service is complete without the word now lord as we endeavor to open up this word lord as i heard your prophecy this morning to the world it's a book of history to the theologian it's a book of education to the common people it's just a book of morals or a code of ethics but he said to the believer it's the revelation of jesus christ and this morning we are not here lord as theologians or intellectuals we're here as believers this morning so father we're inviting you to come and reveal yourself to us in a supernatural way heal the sick lord save the lost lord refill those with the holy ghost father i pray this morning for brother lord balor and his wife there at home lord all those that are at home this morning unable to be here lord i pray you would just touch their bodies lord may you strengthen them father lord may the holy ghost just go through their their bodies right now and drive out every symptom of this virus oh god restore their health i pray and for those lord that desire to be here but have lost are not able to be may you minister to them as well father and we'll be sure today to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen and amen god bless you this morning while you're standing if you have your bibles we'll invite you to the book of romans the 15th chapter and while you're turning there we want to greet you today in the name of the lord we sure counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you it's good to see everyone out again as we said and good to see brother russell and his family it's a surprise to see you all here and god ble well not a surprise it's good to see you all though amen it's not like you're just passing through you're here on purpose we was actually just out in arizona a few days ago and so it's good to see you all good to see everyone here brother brad god bless you and good to get that prayer cloth back amen we sure appreciated that and if we could just look here in the book of romans the 15th chapter amen we sure be glad when all this virus is passed over amen amen we just pray the lord strengthen brother byler and restore him back to the pulpit here very quickly and romans the 15th chapter in the fifth verse the bible here says now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to christ jesus that you may be with one mind and notice here in one mouth glorify god even the father of our lord jesus christ so paul here is taking the mind and connecting it to the mouth and says that you may be with one mind and one mouth glorify so what you're thinking in your mind is going to come out of your mouth and paul here is saying whatever is in your mind then whatever comes out of your mouth let it be glorifying unto our father our lord jesus christ in the book of second timothy the first chapter ii timothy the first chapter and the 11th verse second timothy the first chapter and the 11th verse here paul here writing to timothy says we're unto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and the teacher of the gentiles for the which calls i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed is anybody here today can say i know whom i have believed and then persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day now notice this here in verse 13 hold fast the form of sound words which thou has heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus that the good thing which was committed unto thee keep by keep thee by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us we ask the lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats there for just a few moments this morning if the lord would help me i would like to speak to you from these verses here and maybe just to draw a title here out of the 13th verse paul says hold fast the form of some words which thou has heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus and i want to speak to you for just a few moments you're on hold fast the form of sound words hold fast the form of sound words i i think we're all very much aware this morning that we are living in uncertain times amen the world is full of uncertain times it's the problem of god like you call it a time of uncertainty you'll say that politics are uncertain religion is uncertain uh government is uncertain everything in the world we're living in is uncertain and when things become uncertain then people actually become uncertain themselves so it's not that the world is full of uncertainty but you've actually got a world full of uncertain people that's living in the middle of uncertainty and these people are actually looking for something they're looking for something to give them hope the prophet will say this way they're looking for something to hold on to they're looking for something that they can anchor their lives to now uh the prophet of god preaches a message called the uncertain sound in first corinthians 14 verse eight for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound then who shall prepare himself to the battle if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound then who is going to prepare himself to the battle now that word sound means a voice it means to be noised abroad it means the sound of uttered words put into speech so he's saying here if the trumpet gives an uncertain word or if the trumpet gives an uncertain noise or an uncertain sound amen then who can prepare himself to the battle now in 1960 says now this is a day of uncertainty can you say amen it said here if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound then who shall prepare himself for battle paul's speaking here of course he was speaking to these corinthians and many of them were soldiers in those days in the roman army now now if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself he said you've got to have the certainty of anything he said we've got to know whether it's right or not so if you're going to have something there's got to be a certainty there he said you've got to know whether it's right or not and now we're living in a day of great uncertainty we all know that the day of uncertainty and the time of uncertainty now i want you to catch what he says here i don't believe there ever was a time since the first time began back in the garden of eden when sin come in and broke eternity in the time i do not believe there's ever been a space of time with so much uncertainty as is today now think of that this is 1960 and the prophet is saying there's never been a time amen all the way back to eden that there's been so much uncertainty in the land as there is today now let's fast forward from 1960 and come to 2021 amen and think about how much more uncertainty there is today amen even than there was in 1916 he said there's not even one hope left in the natural world today there's not one hope amen amen now that that's pretty heavy and there's not one hope left in the world amen except jesus christ let me just let me just cut to the chase and say we are not here this morning amen listening to an uncertain sound we ain't that when we read our bible we are not reading an uncertain sound when we listen to a tape amen we are not reading an uncertain sound we are preparing amen by the most certain sound that is on the face of the earth today and let me tell you what it is it is the message of the hour amen ain't that every sound of denomination is uncertain ever every theologian is uncertain every preacher and then apart from this message is uncertain but god he then sent elijah in this age with a certain sound he meant to put a hope in the heart of his people let me say this this morning church the message of the hour has never changed amen and it will never change amen this message is jesus christ and there is nothing uncertain about him amen i'll say it like this we are not this morning as the church of the living god we are not in a national battle amen we we are not in a political battle i know sometimes it's hard even being americans and being amen loving this country and loving the nation you live in sometimes it's hard amen to separate amen what is your battle and what is not your battle but let me just say this amen there is absolutely nothing that we can do to change this nation amen we could go march around washington all day long and we'll never change nothing amen because prophecy has fallen upon this nation amen and when prophecy falls upon something it must come to pass amen let me say it like this prophecy has not just fallen upon this nation but prophecy amen is falling upon you amen prophecy is falling up on this nation that she's going to fall and she's going to bow to roman catholicism amen but there is another prophecy that is taller upon the church in these last days that in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we shall all be changed i'm talking this morning about something amen that is not uncertain it is a certain sound therefore our battles and national battles they are not political battles our battles are spiritual battles which which is the battle for truth amen we are not here this morning battling for something amen that is not at truth we are in the battle for truth the problem god will call it he'll say and in the battle for truth he said them ends it has been lost but god said they would be restored again in the last day i will restore saith the lord amen now let me say this our spiritual battles today what are they brother andrew well let me just give you a few of them the first one is amen to stay positive while surrounded by negativity amen another one is to stay sound while surrounded by unsoundness amen another one is to stay certain while surrounded by uncertainty amen to stay stable while surrounded by instability that is the battle amen that the church is in today proud of god was it like this but we are not cowards amen we are soldiers amen how many soldiers have we got here today amen we're not cowards we're not boy scouts we're not i mean we're not somebody just playing a battle we are soldiers and we didn't choose to be a soldier amen but he chose us to be a soldier in this battle before the foundation of the world he said see in second timothy 2 4 no man that worth amen entangled himself with the affairs of this life amen now let me say this if you're going to be a soldier and then you're going to have to separate yourself amen from everything in this world amen and realize who you are and realize what you're fighting for is that right amen now you think of a natural soldier when he goes and becomes a soldier the first thing they do is they change everything about him they change his identity they change the way he dresses they change the way he looks and amen they they do everything because they're separating him amen from the life that he has known amen and opening up a new life to him and i'll say it like this this message amen is a separation it's going to separate us amen from everything we've ever known amen and open our eyes to what is truth now he said that he may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier amen how many will agree that you've been chosen by god a meant to be a soldier you you this morning are chosen by the almighty god by by general jesus to be a soldier in the battle for truth we are in amen the army of god we we are in the army this morning church amen now you say i am a soldier what comes next well a soldier amen must find their position we hear a lot of preachers about that don't we got to find your position find your position amen but another thing is when you find your position amen you've got to hold it somebody say hold it you've got to hold it so it's not good enough just to find it amen but you've got to hold it you it's not good enough just to know who you are amen but there's got to come a stability there's got to come a certainty there's got to come a soundness amen to the soldier to be able to hold amen the position they're called to the prophet says this way the only thing he is waiting for is for his army to get their position like the stars and then get the position amen now we are in a spiritual battle what kind of battle between right and wrong he said that's right you've got to know the word stay on the word seek the great battle is at hand now we've played church for years and years but the hour has come now that when janice and chambers will withstand moses the hour you're living in is the hour when janice in chambers he says we'll withstand moses as the bible said they would and it's going to be a spiritual battle it's going to be a conflict there will be some just continue on the denominational church will just move on right into denomination and go the way it goes but i mean the real true believer is coming to the battlefield and you better be versed and know what you're doing or you could take an evil spirit so easy and not know it if it's contrary to the word then don't you believe it you stay with the word amen notice how close he's bringing this amen that in this battle it's going to be a battle of spirits and it's going to be a battle where you could so easily amen take an evil spirit and not even know it amen we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against powers and against the rulers of the darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places now the bible says we're here tonight fighting a great warfare which is right that gets wrong amen the word of god against modern theology and trying to make the word of god and bring it to the people while the enemy will try to beset it in every way but one is the majority in god now think about that this morning amen one soldier is the majority in god right here this morning amen if one person needed healing and the entire building didn't believe in healing but one person began to fight against every unbelieving spirit amen that god would come down in this building and would fill that person with healing if there's one individual that wanted the holy ghost this morning and nobody in here believed in the holy ghost but one individual amen said god you made me a promise you would give me the holy ghost and god amen will tear down every demon amen to fill a heart with the holy ghost what are you saying i'm saying we're not here playing church we are in a battle this morning but let me say like this the angels of god are entemped about those that fear him and then the angels of god are here this morning amen pushing against coldness pushing against formalism pushing against demons why we are in a battle but one is the majority in god now amen do you realize you're living in a time where actually the bible prophesies of the time you're living in it's actually in matthew 24. the bible says that the elected amen would be deceived if it was possible but see it's not possible the father said watch how close it gets it gets that razor edge and then out between right and wrong and remember it'll fall on one or the other sides until it comes down sometimes like like a home razor between the difference of right and wrong it's got to be every word of god not just almost every word but every word and it's got down today he said not to the lutherans not to the methodists not the pentecostals amen but two that honed age amen that's a that's a powerful term amen it's gotten down today amen to that honed age amen now how many knows the prophet says amen there's been a lutheran age there's been a western age there's been a pentecostal age he said but now for the first time amen it's coming forth for pride amen the calling of a bride for what amen for a bride age amen here's another term or to a honed age what is that home age it's when not everything is going to go are you awake are you in me it's it's when everything is going to have to be judged by something amen see every spirit is not going to pass the word test amen every idea is not going to pass the word test he's saying we've come to that honed h in this age where the antichrist anointed it so perfectly it would deceive the very lack he said they'll fall on the wrong side if they don't watch it like a wedge he said watch and be careful we're not living in a pentecostal age now we've passed that age just the same as it passed lutheran seed amen we are living in a home owned age amen can i preach to you for a minute we are living in an age amen we're our lives amen there's no room for error we are living in an age where there is no room amen to back off of the principles of this message we are living in a time where there is no room ain't meant to let anything and everything go we have come to a time where we must judge all things or as paul says we must prove all things now the bible says here in first thessalonians 5 21 it says prove all things and then notice these next two words and hold fast to that which is good so paul you're saying you've got to prove all things but when it's been proven what is good then hold fast to it now can i read the definition of the word hold fast it means to keep it means to possess it means to stay it means to take to retain amen from going away to restrain to hold or to head the ship it means to keep secure it means to keep firm possession of it means to get possession of so paul you're saying and then prove all things and get possession of what is good amen amen restrain what is good amen secure what is good now that word hold fast is used in different forms in the scripture like in luke 8 15 the bible says but that on the ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word amen they keep it and bring forth fruit with patience now amen their whole fast is used as keep it so there's going to be a people who's going to hear the word and they're going to keep the word and they're going to bring forth fruit and acts 27 40 when they had taken up the anchors they committed themselves into the sea and they loosed the rudder bands and they hoisted up the main cell to the wind and they made toward the shore there and then the word hold fast is actually used as they made toward the shore in first corinthians 11 verse 1 be followers of me even as i also am of christ now i praise you brother that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinance somebody say keep the ordinances as i deliver them to you so there amen hold fast is used as keep the ordinances in first corinthians 15 1 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached to you which also you received and wherein you stand by which also ye are saved if you keep in memory what i have preached unto you unless you have believed in vain so hear paul saying amen hold fast to that which i preached unto you and then keep it in your memory amen keep it even keep it there on your heart unless you would have heard it and then you would have believed on it and then you would have turned away from it and had believed in vain listen church amen i don't know how much more plainer to say it if there's ever been a time amen to take this message off the shelf if there's ever been a time and then to dust off her bibles and dust off them tapes i say now is the time there is not one thing happening in the world we're living in today but what this message has already warned the church of amen but i'll say it like this if this message ain't meant to warn us of destruction could warn us of nations could warn us of government failures could warn us of everything going bankrupt i say this same message amen can release an anointing in the church a minute of bringing it from just being a gathering ain't meant to be in a powerhouse where the holy ghost has a right away ain't meant to move in every service ain't meant to save the laws and then to fill with the holy ghost hey you may think i lost my mind this morning but i really don't care amen i'm surrounded by unsoundness amen but i've got a sound message and then the world i'm living in is confused amen but i've heard the eagle scream i have heard amen the sound of the gospel trumpet that has called me from confusion these things i'm preaching it's not something i heard yesterday these things were preached in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s amen but somebody held fast to it somebody believed it and it's ought to change oh to think this morning church it's time to put this message back in your minds well let's preach a minute amen it's time to put this message back in your homes amen i think it's a shame and then we got kids on this message they know the voice of every well-known preacher but they can't even identify the voice of a seven angel and i think it's a shame and then we got tapes and they never get played i think it's a shame that we're living in a time where message people amen can identify themselves more amen with the things of politics than they can the things the prophet said well i know and i know it's a confusing time amen but we've heard some things we've heard some sound solid gospel preaching amen and paul would go on to say as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all thanks now look here he says in second thessalonians two verse five remember ye not that which i was yet with you i told you these things paul you're saying remember when i was with you i told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time so paul here takes the word hold fast and he goes to 2nd thessalonians 2 and there that word is used as withholdeth for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now liveth will let until he be taken out of the way remember he says in the first seal for the mystery of iniquity already work he said deceivers you see amen deceiving the people off into something see only he which is god that letteth will let until he he says now that he is church amen christ the bride be taken out of the way so in this honed amen razor's edge time that we're living in there's only one thing a man standing between you are standing between the world and judgment and that is the bride of jesus christ amen and proven his word he said now you know there's a scripture in the bible in first thessalonians 5 21 where it is written prove all things hold fast to that which is good when anything is proven it will either be proven right or wrong he's not saying it's going to be proven and there's going to be a gray area given to it he's saying it's going to be proven right or wrong and when there's anything in question it should be proven until you find out what is right and then as you find out what is right it said hold fast somebody shout that with me hold fast amen in other words he said you grip it don't you turn it loose you hold it fast in other words you hold it tight so that it will not slip you hold fast that which is good after it's been proven right and anything that's proven not right he said then turn it loose as quick as you can he said get away from it don't never hold on to the wrong thing when anything has been proven either right or wrong he said if it's been proven right then you get a hold of it and because it like this put a death grip on it and then get a hold of it and don't turn it loose amen he said but if it's been proven wrong then you turn it loose right quick now it's possible that salts christians find people hold sometimes to the wrong thing thinking it is the right but then these things should be proven whether they are right or wrong and it's the duty of all of us as we are expecting to go to heaven when jesus comes it is the minister's duty when any question is brought up that he solves this out and then proves it before the people that they might understand now see he's going to prove these things that there might come an understanding amen notice because no one wants to be found wrong amen holding to the wrong side so we have a scripture here that all scripture must be fulfilled then hold fast amen let's say this together hold fast get a death grip on it and don't turn it loose fast to that which is good see hold fast amen get a death grip on it and don't turn it loose now in our text here apostle paul is actually writing to timothy who paul is a veteran minister a veteran soldier who is fixing to go off the scene and he's writing to young timothy amen as a veteran soldier of the cross and he says here hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus now i want to break this first down for just a moment that word hold fast there means to get a grip on means to cling to means to hold on to the word form means an outline an example of pattern amen to show by the example of my conversation that the same grace amen i could preach here all day the same grace which i had obtained would not be warning also to those who should hear after believe amen can you imagine paul and timothy even brother can you imagine timothy looking at paul and paul writing to him and paul saying now timothy you hold fast to the form of sound words and in the back of timothy's mind he's thinking paul you're getting ready to go off the scene amen you've been shipwrecked you've been put in prison you've been persecuted all these things has happened to you paul and you're telling me amen that i'm going to make it you're telling me to hold fast amen but paul could look at timothy and say timothy don't worry i may be gone amen but the same grace amen that got me through is the same grace that's gonna come to you let me say this more amen the prophet messenger may be gone amen but the same grace that got peter and paul and james and john through is the same grace that got seven star messengers through that is the same grace and it's going to get the bride of jesus christ through this time of uncertainty we are not left wanting we are not left hoping we have become the recipients of the same grace of god my help me this morning lord amen to see amen that there's not going to be a bride here amen looking for something to hold on to but there's been something left for her now that word sound actually means to be wholesome it means to be sound it means to be well it means to be in good health amen it means to be in good health even so paul you're saying tend to fee you you cling to even the pattern amen of words that will produce good health now i'm not here to ain't meant to get off on a health card a health tank but let me just say this i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health amen even as thy soul prospers the prophet of god said god's god and his bounty of blessings everything we have need of all of the vitamins everything we have need of he said to make us a men full sturdy healthy christians feel with his spirit amen washed in his blood and what a time that we can have a fellowship he said see it's spiritual strength it meant to live in the sunshine the shining of his glory or it's the greatest privilege and then we have been given amen is to live under the sunlight of god's glory he said look at good healthy christians i think it's amazing he says and then you take a man or woman who would put himself down in a cellar he said they'll shut themselves off he said they become anemia he said they become so pale they won't have good strength he says they won't have good health because he has shut himself off from the privilege that god gave him he said then if we shut ourselves off from the glory of god from the baptism of the holy ghost or the fellowship of the spirit he said the first thing you know we become pale amen sickly christians are growing them when the great trials come we shrink and go back it takes the soldier who's lived in the sunlight of god's word amen it takes the spirit of god he said they can wave every doubt they can stand somebody say stand they can stand in the midst of a trouble and cry my redeemer liveth how can they do that because they're feeding up on sound words now watch here we shine ourselves off he said but many today they don't want to get in a healthy healthy place with god he said a healthy christian even had a healthy spirit he said you'll certainly rally for a healthy body anybody would amen well no matter how much health you put in that it's going back to the dust but oh my brother he said that soul cannot get too healthy are you hearing me that soul amen cannot get too healthy every time it grows in the strength and the grace and power of god amen the soul in you amen cannot get too healthy think of that this morning amen people poor and i believe in it i believe we should take care of ourselves right amen but watch something ain't meant they pour into this body and they do they do and then they do all kinds of face lifts and all kinds of plastic surgeries and all kinds of things trying and then to keep health in this body but the problem of god is saying see but they got a soul in there that you can't pour too much health in it amen you've got a soul in there that could not get too healthy you've got a soul in there that cannot get too much power amen so other words we should be believers with healthy souls amen we should be believers with healthy minds amen what what's making our mind healthy is the things which we've kept in remembrance that's been taught now i'd like to read this to you it means simply stated the believers are to hold fast to the holy scriptures to the very words of god himself for the word of god alone somebody said the word of god alone can bring health and life to the human soul he said the words of christ are absolute and people that live and i'm just reading some here people that live by theories and philosophies they will perish by them amen people that live by conspiracies they will perish by them amen but there is an absolute here church there is a word here that we can anchor our lives to what are you saying i'm saying we don't have to live by feelings we can live by what god said amen the prophet said unless you die to yourself and your feelings and act on god's word you'll never have life he said forget your feelings and just take what god said amen see forget your feelings amen forget your sensations forget your emotions and take simply what god said amen now i said like this god amen holds fast to his own words amen god does not speak a word and then change the word and then speak another word and change that amen his first word is a spoken word and his spoken word is a perfect word and his perfect word is an absolute word and what are you saying preacher i'm saying this message it's not a second thought of god it is not a second opinion of god this message is the perfect interpretation of the spoken word of god amen we can laugh we can anchor our souls on it amen i know if y'all forgot the word or not but it's amen amen we can anchor our souls on it we can build our families upon it listen church we ought to be the most happiest people this morning amen the world don't have nothing to build on ain't in brother russell they'll be there they're building families they're building futures upon this country and it's going down quicker than we can watch it amen but there is a kingdom coming and it's not a shaken kingdom it is not an unstable kingdom it is a sound amen certain stable kingdom and that kingdom will never pass away [Music] what are you saying i'm saying hold on to sound words amen god's words are sound words you realize this morning church we are judged even by the word of god either we we are actually this morning judged by the word of god now the prophet god tells us that there's actually two vines he says there is a true vine he said then there is a false vine he said both vines amen hear the words of the lord the true mind hears the words and the false vine hears the words he says now watch he says the true mind hears the words and it strikes joy and gladness and rejoicing in their hearts he said but the false mind amen hears the same words and the same words strike fear and terror in their hearts see what it is it's the force or it's the power of those words that are falling in a heart amen that true vine heart is a prepared heart to receive the words of the lord amen but that falsehood heart is a heart that'll hear the words but it'll fall and it'll go somewhere else but that true line is going to get a hold of those words and they're going to meditate on those words they're going to chew on those words they're going to feast on those words and those words are going to release an anointing in that individual now many times we underestimate the force amen behind our words look here in proverbs 16 24 the bible says pleasant words are as in honeycomb which they are sweet to the soul and their health to the bones but now now i just like to read this bit of commentary here to you honey is delightful taste and see it has a nourishing property that spread throughout the body he said like honey pleasant words add sweetness to a person's life and contribute to good health words carry great power are you hearing me words carry great power and wise people speak words that have a powerful impact and edify the hearts and lives of others amen see their words of wisdom flow from the fear of the lord and the understanding of his word in paul 25 verse 11 the bible says a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver amen wise people are awful or also are are often times careful in choosing their words when settling differences are you hearing me amen words have the ability amen to tear down and ring up amen words have the ability to drive apart and bring together words have the ability amen to discourage one amen or to encourage one's seed amen saying the right thing in the right way at the right time can be very effective in making peace with another person the reference here to gold apples in a silver setting describes something that is both exceptionally and beautiful and extremely valuable it aptly illustrates the benefits of well chosen amen properly spoken words can bring reconciliation are you hearing me amen well chosen properly spoken words have the ability amen to bring reconciliation amen so if you amen and i i can pick on brother wrestler for a minute amen but but if there was a disagreement there between amen i wanted to i wanted to get it worked out and what caused this agreement was i said brother brother russell that title match that shirt and it it ain't very nice amen it put a wall between us amen now if i want to go and i want to fix that and bring a reconciliation i'm not going to go and say well i'm sorry for what i said about your shirt and your tie amen but your shoes are worse are you saying if i'm going to say something to bring a reconciliation i must filter my words i must do something ain't meant to are you hearing me church and this world has been divided and then they've been drawn back by words amen political words and religious words has tore the world apart amen but in the seventh seal amen under the seven angels message there would come a word that would not tear the church apart it would bring the church together listen friends amen denomination was a word that drove people apart amen denomination was a word that tore families apart amen but there was another word which was a word like this a spoken word that did not drive us apart but it brought us together amen i say this our words are important the bible goes on another place and says the words of the wise are as goats and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies which are given from one shepherd the lord god isaiah 54 50 verse 4 the lord god has given me the tongue of the lord are you catching it the tongue of the learn amen that i should know how to speak a word and sees into him that is weary if somebody is already weary you have the power amen to speak a word that can cause them to be more weary or you've got the power to speak a word that can give them strength that can give them grace that can give them are you hearing me the power of our words are a very powerful force but i said see many times you say i can't do very much about the conditions today he said but just a little kind word to someone amen an invitation or a little testimony a little kind smile a greeting to a passerby might mean more than you think it does amen just a little word and it can go a long way just a little word can change an entire situation now you say what are you saying i'm saying notice the power of words it's not the quantity of the words it's spoken it is actually the quality of the words that are spoken you say but then if it's going to be something of words to bring reconciliation it's going to be a lot of words well let's go to genesis and look there in genesis where there was creation power look at the words there were three words spoken let there be are you hearing me and then let there be three little words of let there be amen but behind those three little words was the entire power of creation behind three words it wasn't an essay amen it wasn't a paragraph it wasn't an entire sentence jesus christ spoke three words amen let there be and the son amen felt the force of those words amen the moon and then felt the whole help me jesus the moon felt the force of those words amen those three words amen let's go to the bible and preach a second can we amen the bible says and then in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god right amen said now let's go back to genesis and watch that amen in the beginning god which was the word amen created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep but i love the next part but the spirit moved and then the spirit moved no matter how dark it was no matter how bleak it was no matter how confusing it was there was nothing that could stand in the way of the spirit moving i say this morning church and then you may be just like the earth you may be without form and you may be void and darkness may be covered in your life but the same creates your power has returned in this age amen under a ministry of elijah amen to say let the spirit move again and let there come let there come a garden of eden out of chaos see the words it's not the power it's not the quantity it's the quality look in saint john 11 7 11 17 the bible says this then when jesus came speaking of lazarus he found that he had laid in the grave four days already there says it's so different with jesus and it he sees every little move that you make every little word that you speak every kind deed that you do all of them mean much to him now he says these little words here's a direct quote these little words here tonight of these four letters that's been read for texts they conceal your eternal destination your attitude towards them what were those four words then jesus then when jesus came are you hearing me see when jesus came he said then when jesus came then he takes the text and calls it and then jesus came and that isn't that a small little bit of words but he says look he says what makes him so important he said the little words could set you free from sin then little words of then when jesus came could set you free from sin tonight he said those little words could condem those little words of them when jesus came could condemn you tonight those little words could set you free from sickness and suffering tonight but you've got to receive them they've got to be received and now we just got one service today right so let's just let our hair down for a minute have church okay amen amazing some people come to church believing on their mind amen but let's just let's preach here for a minute okay amen them little words amen could heal you or they conceal your destination them little words could set you free are you hearing it amen see what it is it's not the power of just speaking the words but the words have got to be received amen those words will have effect upon no one if they're never received but when they're received then the effect of those words amen begins to change and then the person that received them and then see on the day of pentecost peter spoke there and said these uh then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added in them about 3 000 souls are you following me and then they received the words amen notice here the evidence they received the words was they went and was baptized so they received the words then they went and was baptized which showed they did more than hear the words but they received the words and the words had effect upon them he said the promise of the holy ghost is an assurance if you'll get if you receive it that way it depends on your attitude towards the word the word is not the paper it's just a book but it's christ it manifests on the paper he said we just received his word just like it was he himself when i see his promise to me that christ he said i embrace it amen amen notice this he cannot lie to me it's exactly the true see i might not know how to take a hold of it but it's the truth and i'll hold right with it because it's christ to me when i read his word when i hear his word i will receive his word and his cries to me the brother goes another place and says when god speaks a word it's already finished are you hearing me when god speaks a word it's already finished and what about his promises that he's given to us everything he has said it's already a finished work so therefore when we receive his word into our heart it's already done it's completed oh help me this morning church amen when you receive his word into your heart it's not going to begin to work it's not going to begin to be done but the prophet said when you receive it it's already completed it's already finished it's just looking amen for a bonnie come on church amen look at i say he prophesied and said behold amen a virgin shall conceive do you realize that word word that word circled the earth for some 700 years it was not a word that had to be tampered with it was not a word that had to be changed it was a spoken word it was a perfect word it was a creative word the only thing it was waiting for was a room that could be received and i say this morning church there has been a prophecy and it's been circled the earth and then there is going to be a bride there is going to be an invincible army there is going to be a church aimed with the power of god and the apostolic blessings amen flowing through it that word has been circling amen for years but this morning there is a womb on the earth to receive the spoken word and allow it to manifest oh god help me are you hearing me church your wound this morning is a prepared womb to receive a prepared word and there is a force there's a force behind the word now you say blender what is the word well the prophet said a word is a thought expressed a word is a thought express he said see god's thinking expressed it his words through the prophets and they wrote the bible which is in word form i love that they wrote the bible which is in word form and jesus called it a seed and any seed will bring forth of its kind if it's in the right condition the right atmosphere how many knows atmosphere is the most important thing an atmosphere when it comes to a seed is so important now watch here the problem says what is the word he said a word is a fault expressed now can i this very simple but i pray it's helping somebody i want you to notice something here notice the order amen it's fault then the word the new expression it's a fault then it's a word then it's expressed promises see before you say anything subconsciously you think it before you speak it is that right amen i'll watch in the beginning was the word this was a minute ago in the beginning was the word that's as far as we can go back by this theology but before the word was it was a fault see as far as the written word this morning as far back as we can go is genesis 1 in the beginning was or in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth right but a prophet says see but there was an existence of that word before it become written formed it was a fault in the mind of god he said see and the word was made manifest when jesus no wonder can i take some time and read this to you it's powerful when no wonder when he come off the hill that night and looked around at the tree for food there was no there were there was no food on the tree and he said no man eat it from me and he went on away and the next day coming back the tree and withered he said god's mind the mind that in the beginning that was a fault before it was a word that expressed jesus christ he said the same one was expressing that word back again the same mind that was expressing itself in genesis 1 has now come to john 1 14 when the word has become flesh and the same mind-hole god the same mind back there is now in flesh speaking the same word he said and every word in the bible is god's thoughts amen laying in seat form that if they're received into the human being and spoke by the same fault that materialized the bible brings the same thing to pass are you following my trail now amen this is beautiful amen think of this brother russell all the way back there amen was the mind of god in genesis 1. and that mind amen come into jesus in john 1 14 and that same mind it's not dead this morning amen but that mind is in the evening like tabernacle amen in elkton kentucky this morning the same mind that spoke in genesis one that cursed the victory is the same mind that it's in the church today and the province said see and what difference is it to you if it becomes a real revelation it becomes real revelation he said back there he said you're let there be and let there be this he said then how much more today uh how much more today can we say let there be no cancer are you hearing me amen the same authority is in the church today by the word now this is what it's going to take though when the human element goes out the spirit of god fills the vacancy when you empty yourself amen then we'll be the church and if it's power in the resurrection we'll walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his movement then your thoughts will become words and words will become material oh jesus what is a word a word is the fault expressed amen let's follow the trail again amen god above us amen bond with us amen and now it's god in us are you hearing me amen and your words amen your thoughts will become words then your words will become material church this time is not coming this time is here and then he said it like this i believe it's on its road when the church will be so wrapped in christ and the holy spirit mankind sow away from themselves they don't see themselves they don't have no oh but all they think is to serve god and their thoughts just move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit they live in the spirit they move in the spirits they walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of christ then the love of christ in the human heart moving by the holy ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity because deity because deity because they no i'm not a broken record i want to drive this home because deity will be revealed in human beings by the holy spirit bringing to pass the fault in their mind that'll hit you about 10 o'clock tomorrow at work and you'll scare me to death are you hearing me deity is back in the earth being revealed again brother brad amen bringing the thoughts to pass are you hearing me the time has come what did what did the bible say the bible said the time will come that they will call but before they call i will answer and while they're yet speaking i will hear are you hearing me see or we've come to church deity has come back in the church by the power of the spoken word amen now what are you saying i'm saying negative thoughts even produce negative words which produce negative expressions amen a negative thought will produce a negative word which will produce a negative all right you can't tell me that you've got a negative a negative thought and you speak negative words all you think is negative thoughts and all you speak is negative words and you got the most positive expression it don't work negative thoughts produce negative words produce negative expressions now if that works in the negative then let's bring in the positive where positive faults amen produce positive words which in return will produce positive expressions now we've all heard this quote i know you can probably read it to me before i even start reading it but can i can i dissect it for a second it's in law 1955 paragraph 18. he said now it's a strange thing that this is so much full of people this is a strange thing that this is so much the thought of people notice the order the thought of people they say so they think it then they say well i'm weak and my faith is not very much i'm not a very good christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then see you must never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time i am saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all my heart do you believe in divine healing with all of my heart never permit a negative fault to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts that then don't entertain it amen said you can't stop the thoughts from coming but you have got the power but deity amen to refrain from entertaining those thoughts well you say i can't help the thoughts from coming he said like the farmer with the birds couldn't stop him from flying over his place but he could sure stop him from roosting he said see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir jesus christ is my savior all things are mine by god and i'm going to keep them i'm going to testify them and god can only bless you as you confess he has done for you see he's the high priest of your confession if you've got a negative thought then you'll have a negative word which will produce a negative expression which is a negative confession but if word or positive fault producing a past word it's going to produce a positive expression and you're going to have even a positive confession and are y'all hearing me and you realize there's some people let's just let's just preach it for a minute there's some people that really need to get a change you ever speak to people and you ask them how they're doing and about 30 minutes later tonight you wish you'd never ask are you hearing me i said brother don't don't tell me uh i won't call his name but his pastor he said i went out after service one morning i said how you doing says he said about an hour and a half later he said i thought well i'm sorry i asked see amen but if you're feeding no negative then your words are going to be negative then your expression is going to be negative then the atmosphere around you is going to be negative and we have no excuse to be living under the negative we did not receive a negative message we did not have a negative prophet we are not reading from a negative bible the words we are listening and feeding upon they are not negative they are positive see david would say the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable and i shall lord my strength and my redeemer he said while they were thinking on these things a stranger walked out when you go to thinking about him is when he appears he said see they were talking about him when he appeared and that's the reason maybe he needs us maybe we're talking about trading cars or or what kind of soap powder to use or listen to the radio or something he said batteries he don't appear did you ever notice how the angel lord comes of an evening at three o'clock when i go in i close everything out i don't let no one come in and just sit there and read the word and yield myself until i know he's there i can feel it when he's coming he comes in and i know he's here oh my that's the way you do that's the way the disciples did they were with one place and one accord in a peru and they were all up there preaching him and all of a sudden are you hearing me all of a sudden he came in that's the way he does it so these people are going along the road meditating on him talking about him and he stepped out and said how'd he do he said see why are you so sorrowful are you hearing me amen now here's the people that that should have never been negative they should have not you said andrew they had just lost jesus and their their leader just died he had just been crucified amen but he left him some positive words he left them some positive words and they should have been feeding upon those words amen amen from the time they took him away and they hung him up on the cross amen and they stretched him between the heavens and the earth amen and the blood ran out they should have been feeding upon you destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it up again that should have been their food they should have been holding fast amen but because amen of the atmosphere because they were human they began to become discouraged and they began to come to press and here they are walking down the road are you hearing me they're walking down the road and out steps a man don't you thank god for a kentucky prophet outsteps a man and remembers jesus looked at him and said how'd he do how'd he do amen said he had a smile on his face oh jesus he had a smile on his face he said my well you why are you so sorrowful this morning hey why are you so sorrowful this morning he said my you look terrible oh mercy and then let's preach every minute you your sister's getting ready for church you know you go your husband say how's this look and he don't give you the answer you want to hear and it's a little rough right to church ain't it but but here here is the lord jesus looks and says you look terrible you look sorrowful why you got a big old frown on your face remember said they stopped and they looked at him and said oh amen are you i mean he said you being jews why do you look like that why aren't you smiling they said why are you just a stranger out here i guess not he made the heavens and the earth how would he be a stranger he said are you just a stranger so they ask him are you a stranger and he was the one that made the earth they was walking on he was the one amen that was hung up on the cross that went in the tomb that went in the regions of the laws that priests of the souls in prison that took the keys of death hell and the grave away from the devil amen and ascended back up on high and rose on the third day amen and he's more happier than they are now notice this why are you being jews why are you frowning what if the word let me just say it this way what if jesus was to walk in here like that today in a corporate body like he did back then what if he walked the aisles of this church and said y'all being message believers why are you all so sad why why y'all frowning why you look so sorrowful have you and you know what we would say we'd say have you not heard trump didn't get reelected have you not heard the jobs have you not heard are you have you not seen we went but he would say look amen you should be happy because your joy is not coming from this realm your joy is coming from another realm what are you saying i'm saying church amen take this frown off your face amen yes i'm just like you i hate to see this nation going the way it's going i hate to see what's going on we this you would be different amen but let's realize friends we have got more than they've got there is more with us than there is with him we have got a word and it's a positive word we should take the frown off of our face listen church i'll say it like this for the russell i don't think there should be one message believer that listens to a tape that i'll have a frown on their face i don't think there ought to be one preacher as much stress as we're under i don't think there should ever be a time we let that old naked devil amen put a frown upon our face because no matter how negative things are we've got a positive word brother andrew don't you realize i'm spiritual that's why i frowned no you're miserable that's why you frown brother andrew frowning a spiritual well i'm glad you think that but a prophet didn't a prophet said god don't want you to be frowned and god wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy can i read you a few here i believe that the reason people doesn't have the victory in their heart that they should have is because their thoughts are on other things the token 1960 1964 why don't you identify yourself in death to your own thinking tonight and let the thought that's in him be in you let the meditation of my heart be acceptable thee oh lord let thy word if you abide in me and my word in you that is him then ask what you will and it will be given to you 1962 sirs we would see jesus therefore we should never speak anything but what we believe and understand and let it be pure and let it be undefiled and let it be holy let our conversation be clean and pure our faults thinking the best things thinking god's thoughts stand up on god's program and away from the things of the world now let me say this a lot of our problems could be fixed even without medicine well they got quite there a lot of our a lot of our problems can be fixed without psychologists a lot of our problems can be fixed without psychiatry a lot of our problems can be fixed if we could get our fault life or our thought pattern under subjection of the holy ghost if we could get the thoughts or thinking under the subjection of the holy ghost by the filter of god's word which is the thank you man's filter the promise is one of the most important things we must master now remember this and especially young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing we've got to master if we expect to fulfill god's desire in our life that is we have to master the fault of human ability brother brad i didn't have something else we have to master the word like to match the expression he says you've got to master the fault if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that god can use us notice this let me say it like this you can only disguise thoughts with words and expressions for so long you can only because what is thoughts thoughts is the root is this okay fault is the roots of words it's the roots of expression see if you don't change the root it's going to continue to put forth the same fruits and the bible says this for as he thinketh in his heart so is he or i said first thing friends is the preparation of the human heart he said for years they didn't think that god knew what he was talking about but they found out there was actually mental faculties in there he said but right in the human heart is a little compartment in the middle of the human heart that doesn't even have a blood cell in it it is the occupation to the soul he said so man really thinks with his heart and not with his head oh mercy notice this a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringing forth that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh think of this think of this remember said it's got to be a change a change of heart not the physical thing amen but the heart of your soul something anchors somebody say that with me something anchors something anchors to your thoughts that way is dull you don't see that no more you just see the lord jesus you just see righteousness and holiness and purity and love and grace he said what is a convert means to me change something over and your thoughts your habits your being has been changed from a sinner to a christian first thing you know and in your heart then you express it with your lips that it materializes and that's what you are now if you think you're thinking but you imagine you're thinking he said see and doesn't materialize and you're on the wrong road look if you imagine you're a christian and you speak it out with your lips but you find out that you're not you better get your thoughts changed get your heart changed because it doesn't bear the record it doesn't bear fruit you're expressing something here that's not in here my you're expressing something in here that's not in here now watch this he says like this david said i fall on my ways and turn my feet in our testimonies you realize this morning church your thoughts are louder in heaven than they are up on the earth your thoughts right now are crying louder in heaven than they are upon the earth now look what the bible says the bible says keep which means guard thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life the bible said this way he said keep your heart right with god and everything else comes all right keep that spirit right from everything from that spirit this way of perish whether it's houses land homes health whatever it may be it's perishable and it'll go right straight back that spirit again and right back in the spirit again keep that right no matter what you hear in this world what you have in god keep your heart in tune with god if that's right with god he said then you may not have houses you may not have lands you may not have money he said but if your heart is right with god he said you'll come forth in the resurrection as certain as there's a god in heaven are you hearing me if it's not right with god you're going to take the other route now see it like this what are you saying brother batman gives us instructions i hope i'm coming to a close i hope this is a help remember i'm giving instructions on receiving the holy ghost he said i'll just keep your hands up keep your head praying keep your heart filled just saying lord i believe you notice this he takes it all the way in by the bread to the receiver the holy ghost with the fault word expression he says keep your heart keep your mind keep your hands up keep your head praying keep your heart filled amen and see amen your heart amen is the source of words your heart is where the words are coming from and he's saying just keep your heart saying lord i believe you what are you saying church i'm saying this if we're going to get out of this world if we're going to leave here with victory we're going to have to have a change of heart change the negative let the positive come in oh mercy brother andrew you don't realize my family is a negative family we'll change it well brother andrew you don't realize i i'm a negative person well there's a god here by the holy ghost who can change you being negative is not spiritual see the human mind was chosen in the battlegrounds of the greatest male ever fought but i said see he said now notice there's a few minutes here and i'm done he said notice when this great battle started on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to reach and that battlegrounds begin in the human mind there is where the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was beginning and that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head see now they never started it from organization or from mechanical affair therefore the organization can never do the work of god he said you've got to meet your enemy is in your mind you've got to make your choice now when brother man preaches the greatest bad ever fault have you ever noticed how he keeps referring to a little girl it's an accident it's called the greatest believer phone he's referring to a little girl he keeps saying a little sister i want you to keep this in mind he keeps referring her he said like miss i want this little girl here that's very sick to be sure and listen out real closely notice this why was he doing that because he was introducing ame i'm coming to close so don't get nervous okay he's introducing the key to victory is the changing of your thoughts now we've got to get this certain thing fixed he said let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one accord with what one shadowed out anywhere there would not be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes he said yeah there would not be nobody here desiring the holy ghost but what we're receiving if you could just get that certain thing fixed now remember it's not christian science it's not mind over matter he said the mind accepts the life which is the word of god and there it brings the life just your thought doesn't do it but the word of god oh god but the word of god brought in the channel of your thoughts see it's not the fault as christian science makes it no that isn't it it's your mind accepts it and it grasps it even when it's in your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of god and the thing that's got life in it it brings life into you are you hearing me amen oh brother when that takes place when life comes down the channel into you the word of god is manifesting you if you abide in me my words about you ask what you will he said see the word amen is the spin and the spirit your mind catches the word and brings it in and grasp it what's it do brother it gets a hold of it amen it lays claim on it and it don't turn loose at it he said see it's not where your emotions are set he said it's where your heart sits you all remember the young girl the rem said the psychiatrist come in and saw her one time he said she he come in and he began talking to her and he said have you ever been have you ever had smoke she said no he should have you ever drank she said no he said you ever been with a boy she said no everyone said see he told her you're not living life he said you're not living my roommate said what he died that's what he said now him being a psychiatrist he swung the girl's mind he swung the girl's mind until now she's become so evil and so bad till she don't even want to hear the name of jesus spoke in her presence brother russell how did she get in that condition because a psychiatrist amen swung her mind amen at the same time he said it's because she turned [Music] her thoughts from christ unto what that psychiatrist was moving her mind and that's what oh my brother bradley said and that's what we're here this morning he said we're here this morning is to move your mind and your thinking from the things of the world under the things of god which is eternal and that's what preaching is for is to pervert the thinking to a higher and better to the place where christ is until you become converted in your mind amen help me somebody then your mind reach reaches for those things which are above let me say this church i thank god for this message you say blender why do you thank god for this message because brother russell this message amen challenges every thought i ever had it challenges every direction or you hear me what good would the message be if it didn't challenge our preaching if it didn't challenge our theology this message challenged and it caused us amen to begin to reach into our hearts it begin to cause us amen to reach into the unknown where god is what are you saying i'm saying this sure he said life comes amen that kind of life comes when it becomes miserable now notice this you got a psychiatrist amen i'm gonna take a little liberty here you've got a psychiatrist a man over here swinging a girl's mind swinging our ambitions swinging our emotions swinging in our mind for the wrestle until he destroyed that girl's life he swung her mind so far and then but at the same time amen you've got to swing in her mind there's a prophet standing and saying whether or not this could be father just by every christian with one accord while they're getting there with the holy spirit is fallen many times save feel the believers heal the sick and the afflicted and constantly meetings are going on what a place what a time just now for him somebody shout for him those that like your weight for him for him to come tonight just to be amen lord and sway every heart sway every heart to him with a full assurance that he's here he's a president it's now god oh church while the world is swinging the hearts and the minds of the people in the regions of the lost there is a message hallelujah there is a message that is swinging in the hearts of believers in the presence of almighty god cool somebody are you hearing the church they're swinging them out that way but there's a prophet here swinging our hearts to a full assurance another place my ministry my ministry is not to personally contact each one it's to bring forth the full assurance of the resurrection of the lord jesus and to tell them look to jesus what are you saying preacher i'm saying we must submit our thoughts in ways to his and his thoughts brother man i don't have time to get into it i'm out of time but the man the church age book tells us the thoughts of god are eternal thoughts let me leave you with this the condition of a temporary situation cannot cannot change the eternal thoughts of god for i know the fault get out by five minutes i'll take you by your hamburger for i know the thoughts i pray this is helping you i know the thoughts i think towards you seth are thoughts of peace not of the evil to give you an expectation see so your end is already determined your end is already it's already prepared the problem of god goes on to say daniel read the same words you were reading this morning do you realize daniel took the words of jeremiah goes down into babylon and held onto those words 60 some years in captivity daniel held on to the words of jeremiah he clung to him brother russell they they become his strength when when there was nobody to pray with him them words were there when there was nobody to worship with him then word are you hear me here was daniel in captivity around a bunch of sickly people but he was the most healthy christian among them because he had the words of a prophet jeremiah's words were sound words the prophet the father said see we've got then what are we going to do we got to take those words and as christian soldiers i'm going to close my bible okay as christian soldiers we've got to fight like we've never fought before amen we got to fight the good fight of faith right we've got to keep a good profession let me give you some scriptures to fight with first timothy 6 12 fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life one of them are also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses i give thee charge in the son of god who quickeneth of all things and before christ jesus who before pontius pilate witnessed the good confession jesus christ brother russell was fixing to be killed standing before pontius pilate but even punches pilate could not cause him amen to change from a positive confession to a negative one they overcame them him by the lamb and by the word what is the word mean the word means uttered by a living voice by the word of their testimony you've got to have a battle if everything comes lazy well aren't you overcoming they overcome by the word of god and their testimony of the blood of christ what did you join the army and get training for to lay around to strut up and down the streets and show off that's the way some christians act but we want to be they want to be looked up to you ain't going to be looked up to you're going to be looked down pick up the sword and start fighting pick up the sword and cut everything free from you and keep on going paul says if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoice of hope firm unto the end another place let us hold fast our profession another place let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering and he said abraham you're old your strength is gone your arms are withered up your manhood's gone i'm your mother just take a hold are you hearing me church take a hold of my promise and be satisfied while you're waiting be rested now that's why everybody for no matter how bad the cancer's got you how long you've been sitting in a wheelchair any of those things just if you can grasp that revelation from god then be satisfied knowing that it's going to happen because faith waits patiently for the promise when god speaks he makes preparation for the fulfilling of what he has spoken you love him this morning god speaks to you you'll see god see his power see his resurrection if you can feel it way down in your heart then accept him and accept his word if you can feel it way down in your heart that is true then just go right on make preparations because everything's going to be all right look at this little gross book of the night maybe the little ladies you're not with a baby that had the foot hanging down from zion she was so certain this woman was so certain that the baby was going to walk so she went and got her pair of shoes and come down for it to be prayed for i love this brother brad and then when she crossed the platform to pray for her she looked at the baby tried its foot and it was no better so she went down to mother's and mother knew i was going out to the office so they sent the girl out there and the little girl came in and i said was it you lady that was prayed last night said yes said but you know the lord spoke to me and said for me to bring my baby to you and you and you laid your hands on my baby it was going to walk i said well then that's all it's necessary god said it that's all we have to do just believe it except but the baby's not walking i said that don't have anything to do with if you're certain you won't be questioning so we prayed and laid hands on the baby and i said sister i could stand to do it all day now if you're certain and you really believe it'll happen it'll certainly be that way and then when she started out she wanted to hear she wanted to hear she wanted to hear me say something else poor little fella little lady are you here not raise your hand if you are he said somebody was here the other night when she was here he said notice she was certainly going to heal that baby but she wanted me to say something about it and then she needed something to hold on to he meant well i'd already told the brethren here i said just won't watch so when this went out of the room kind of disappointed a little kind of crying she looked back a little hubby went on out so when she looked back and she said reverend branham i said yes ma'am she said is it god's will for my baby to be a she just wanted to hear what i was going to say pulled it right out i said no ma'am it's not and she said thank you sir and out the door she went and about a week after that the little baby's leg come down normally and well see just hold on to it get a hold of something and hold on to it even the baby was healed the word i'm done out here if i don't quit austin come tackle me are you hearing me the word was settled even by his stripes that baby was healed that word circled for years but when that baby's foot was hanging ain't then the problem of god prayed but it did change but that woman needed something to hold up she needed something that she could fight the devil with and i'll sit like this this i bet for an entire week every time that devil said your baby is never going to walk she looked at that devil and said but god's prophet said it's not god's will for my baby to be a and about seven days later that baby's leg come normal what are you saying i'm saying when god drops the revelation of anything in your heart you hold on to it you fight the devil with it as a good soldier let our music players come fight the devil with your profession with your confession brother branham right now in that message spoken word original seed i was out hunting several months ago now this of that tape for brad preached on that spokeswoman to see he went about the boy i said i'm about to go with you you hear me this when you get something to hold on to hold on to it church don't turn what are you saying i'm saying turn loose of everything that's been proven wrong this message has been proven right it's thus something i'm saying right now we've got cowards around this message that they preached this message and they went around the world and they they got ministries off this message and now they're cowards they've been sitting behind youtube cameras and screens and putting this message on trial guy the other day sent me a clip said somebody's putting the message on trial i said well you tell that brother he's about 56 years late because william branham himself put his own message on trial before the entire world about seven times and every time amen the judge of all judges come down in the building and said it's the truth it's the truth it's settled what are you saying i'm saying this message is settled in heaven it's settled upon the earth it's settled in my heart i'm a believer and i'm gonna hold on to it i'm gonna fight the devil with it it's the confession of our heart won't you stand your feet with us this morning oh mercy glory to god hold fast certain well brother andrew i'm holding on to dr fauci's words they aren't certain are you hearing me his words changes more and some people change his clothes i mean sometimes they change four times in one day one day it's one mass next day it's four next day it's five next day it's none next day it's two two hours later it's three uncertain surrounded brother david surrounded by uncertainty surrounded by unsoundness surround the basket but we have heard a certain sound no matter what happens we've heard sound words y'all ever heard of a man named congressman shaw i want to give this to you in the early 1900s madison was nowhere where it is today william upshaw was an 18 year old boy when he fell and broke his spine and become an inland at the turn of the century and that was worse than anyone could imagine an 18 year old boy had come to terms he may never walk again the next seven years would be spent in a bed eventually he would learn to walk again with crutches he called his little buddies he faced challenges but he built inner strength by holding fast to sound words titus said sound speech that cannot be condemned that he is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you can i can i give you three words three three phrases you might want to put these in your phone or write them down on a notepad these were the three phrases that william upshaw became famous for the first one was let nothing discourage you let nothing discourage you you know what the second one was never give up now the third one's my favorite one god will heal me it just isn't time yet god will heal me it just isn't amen don't never give up every day laying in a hospital bed walking on crutches don't never give up don't ever become discouraged one day god will heal me it just isn't his time yet and the bible says in genesis 17 sarah shall bear unto be a child at the set time genesis 21 amen at this set time in which god has spoken amen exodus 9 and the lord appointed a set time psalms 102 13 thou shall arise and have mercy upon zion for the time to favor her yea the set time has come ecclesiastes 3 1 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the sun he met all those years brother austin he laid in a hospital bed he walked on crutches he said never give up don't let anything discourage you god's gonna heal me it's just not his time yet all but in february 8 amen 1951 in los angeles california amen it came his set time and a prophet said i see you amen and he got up and he began walking all through those depressing days and negative times he built inner strength what are you saying preacher i'm saying this never give up don't let anything discourage you god will heal you god will save he got a set time found the good fight of faith push over every negative thought destroy every negative word get rid of every negative expression let the positive somebody hear this more be willing to raise your hands and say lord let the positive possess this vessel but could you say it like this let me be the most positive believer in this church if this is not your church review let me be the most positive believer let me have a testimony let me hold fast let's buy our hearts together this morning you love him this morning friends we need something that's more uncertain and we've got it quit looking for something you're not going to find anything more certain than the message of the hour been around the world seven times faced every demon ever

believe the same mind that spoke back there in genesis came over to john 1 has come into this age the mind of god the mind of god was above us john 1 14 the mind of god was with us but today the mind of god is in us [Music] deity was above us deity is now with us deities now in us be it in our faults deity in our words deity and our expressions oh church no wonder he spoke no wonder he spoke and

special way lord may you send a surge of strength to this assembly that you send a surge of strength through our pastor's body this morning may you send a serge of strength to every individual or for

to turn directions give them the courage to turn their feet towards their testimony and follow in the paths of righteousness lord your mouth of your children today [Music] help us to get a hold of that revelation and grasp it and never turn it loose hallelujah oh can we just raise our hands to him this morning can we just say lord help me today father help me today lord to get a hold of this
