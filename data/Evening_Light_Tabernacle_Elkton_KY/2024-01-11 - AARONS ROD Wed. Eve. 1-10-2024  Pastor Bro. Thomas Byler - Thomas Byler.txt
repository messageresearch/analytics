water spets up amen get ready amen so praise the lord we got the cold weather coming up looks like by Sunday or Saturday night Sunday and then next week am in down pretty low so amen sometimes when it gets a little colder like this it's Amen your body you know it's he it doesn't like to leave the house amen harder to go to church and get inspired about going to church man it's so cold you know amen you know what brother bam said sometimes for some people it's too cold for other it's too hot you know or some reason you know I had to think on the way to church tonight I said if we went by our feelings I wonder how many of us would have showed tonight right you really went by what your flesh wanted to do a that right amen praise the Lord and so amen I'll tell you what I just felt felt like I could really use a refreshing really needing refreshing refreshing amen and my thought is speaking on refreshing so we're really gonna preach to myself tonight amen so God bless you tonight it's just good to be in the house of the Lord good to see everybody amen it's always good amen when you want to come least or do something to least that's a good sacrifice amen that's when we want to do it amen because if we went by our flesh my goodness where would we be Ain that right where would we be if we went by our flesh's desires amen praise the Lord so amen I thought about just having a prayer meeting tonight just to have a prayer meeting it's called Wednesday night prayer meeting you know amen but we preach most of the time amen so maybe I'll cut it short and we'll have a little prayer meeting maybe I said so amen amen want to give the Lord thanks for all he's done amen with sister Hannah's operation is that right amen what God's doing for sister Mildred amen and sister Pon let's give the Lord a hand amen certainly glad that that went well amen and that she's recouping recovering amen and so we continue to pray that she'd get her strength back she works hard as it is and so I'm sure she needs a lot of rest amen so God bless her Amen in a special way um I can't think of any another any other major announcements so let's just bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus we come before you tonight thankful once again Lord to be inside a nice warm place Lord Jesus and to honor you Lord Jesus by coming out father and making the sacrifice of our time lord Jesus to come to hear your word and to see what you would have for us tonight God and we just pray Lord that you'll bless what I feel you've laid on my heart to speak for a little while that you would just have your way God and just speak to our hearts tonight Lord once again we want to thank you Lord we just want to thank you for all that you do for us every day in Jesus name amen amen my thought originally come from Aaron's Rod I titled it Aaron's Rod but I really want to talk about refreshing refreshment amen being refreshed but Aaron's Rod amen and how that when it was inside of the holies of holies how did it budded and blossomed and yielded almonds amen amen and so amen if you will turn your Bibles and we'll go to Isaiah first I really only had to two scriptures usually my Bible is got about 20 little tabs I'm going to read the second one one but just before I came out amen I had two more that kind of come to me so we'll see if we go there amen amen so praise the Lord amen in Isaiah 28 Isaiah 28 thank everybody for coming out and God bless those listening and streaming wherever they are amen amen praise the Lord we're getting close now we're getting close now to be able to get our fast internet get some better cameras up so that anybody that is streaming can see it better and hear it better amen so shouldn't be long it's on string toown road coming our way I guess amen all right Isaiah 28 verse 9 Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine to them that are weaned uh from the milk and drawn from the breast precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line here a little and there a little for with a stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to his people amen I believe this was talking about Pentecost amen and he says to whom he said this is to rest wherewith he will cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear amen may God add his Blessing to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight amen this is not only is this the rest amen that'll cause the weary to rest but it's also a refreshing amen you know I I just want to start perhaps by talking about all the re that we need the r re how manyan we human beings we have a lot of reads that we need amen one is we need to be refreshed amen the other one is we need to remember how many believes we are forgetful people I believe Peter said amen that he wanted to stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance amen so we need our minds amen refreshed and we need to remember things amen a lot of times we need rebuke is that right as many as I love rebuke I chasen and so forth ain't that right amen reprove amen reprove us sometimes we need revived amen I many believes we as humans need revived amen because we are human and as long as we are in this body and in this flesh amen it's going to be a constant pull in the wrong direction amen amen so amen I'll just go ahead and bring the one scripture in Hebrews 2 says you you know therefore we ought to give the more Earnest to the things that we have heard least at any time we should let them slip cuz how many knows as human beings we're prone to slip we're prone to slip we're prone to slide amen a lot of times and that is a lot of times backwards amen amen but here we look at this here uh scripture about talking about this is the this is what amen this is the rest wherewith I will cause the weary to rest now I want to read the scripture about Aaron's uh Rod because we know that where how many knows where Aaron's Rod was amen he was inside of that holies of holies in the presence of God isn't that right and it says in that you don't have to turn to it numbers 17 and5 Blossom and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel whereby they murmur against you amen so we know that uh Moses laid that that he laid that Aaron's Rod they had put everybody a lot of other people's rods in there too but he said the one that blossoms and so forth is the one that he amen has chosen to be his priest and so forth amen amen and I got to thinking about the holies of holies now when we think about the holies of holies I didn't bring the little thing out here I love to use it amen and I've preached on this a bunch of times but you know when you think about it I think it was about four me messages brother Brandon preached one with the inil amen um the other one was why are the people so tossed about and I can't think it off top of my my head right now but there was the inner Court perhaps there was two more amen uh uh message that the prophet preached and he focused on Amen on uh the holies of holies in the Tabernacle in the wilderness amen we know that at the beginning of course and this has to do with the presence of God Amen I believe perua means the presence of God Amen and soen we want to talk about the presence of God for a little while amen and again just looking at the scope of the whole picture when you look at the scope the whole picture Paul said that we might know the height and the breadth and the depth to know the love of God and to to to understand that begin to Fathom the depth of God amen amen and so I think what was it what was it that we preached last something about being closer to God and how we should get and what we do to get closer to God ain't that right it talked about meditating on him day and night and tell your children to tie it upon your post and let it be as funlet between your eyes and so forth amen um I'm not sure I I would think somewhere it talks about even on you know sometimes even on yourself amen frontless between even on your body amen you know so I you know it's not so that so wrong to where uh you know you might get a persecution but that's okay to have scriptures perhaps on your shirt or whatever amen but anyway just to meditate on him day and night and so forth that's going to be what brings you closer as you has Fellowship as you have communion with God Amen tonight's going to be focused more amen going into that Holy place now let's go all the way back to the beginning we know Adam and Eve after they sinned and they fell short amen of the glory of God they were thrown out and they were ke kicked out so to speak the Angels amen ran them out of the Garden of Eden and there was cherubs there was Angels put up in place Amen to keep them from the Tree of Life isin't that right to keep them away from the Tree of Life and nobody could come in the presence of God because they were not holy they were not pure and you couldn't come into His presence amen so he kept them out then the next place we find God tabernacling of course we know that he was in the they built it and the holies of holies there were three courts there was the outer Court where they had like the sacrifice their sacrifice they washed it and burned it and so forth am me the second part was a actually a door that they went into and it was the sanctuary like where they had the seven golden candlesticks and all of that amen typing the church ages a that right and then behind the that was the holies of holies there was a veil or a curtain made out of badger skins and all of those type of things Amen to keep people from the back there amen and you dare shouldn't go back there or you would be struck dead and even Aaron had to have everything just right amen he had to have everything just right he had to walk right he had to smell how many of those he had to be perfumed even he had to wear the perfume and everything like that amen oh my I don't know if I can find it right off the gate or not gogate or not but amen he had to come in there just right amen because if he didn't amen he was also struck dead but he had to come right and it was a type it was a type how that a sinner any body that comes and approaches God and he had he had I believe he had a thing of blood in front of him ain't that right he had to come with blood and how many knows when you approach the throne of God and you want to get anything from God you don't just come to any way you want to however you want to know you better come by the blood you ain't going to get to God unless you know you bring the blood you come by the blood of Jesus Christ amen and amen because even in the New Testament it says we can approach a throne of grace boldly coming boldly Before the Throne of Grace by the blood of Jesus Christ amen and so we know that they were un allowed to they would you B Dar to go in behind that Holy don't don't dare come into that presence amen but you know uh you know the other place that we find now how many knows where the holies of holies is now yeah where's the holies of holies now Jesus Christ how many US Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is the holies of holies that's why Jesus said come I mean know after the death burial Resurrection you know then you could come into the presence of God not before not before the death and actually whenever that veil was rent how me when that veil was rent amen and put that put God in back into the presence of God amen and then Jus said come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest and you know I don't care where you are I don't care what church service it is I don't care where you are it's all about the presence of God right that's what it's about amen and you and I are a privileged people how many believe you're privileged people to come into the presence of God okay there was something else I wanted to start with amen amen all right well where's it at right here this last one underneath here let's start like this I heard brother make mention this and this is kind of off the subject but I just I thought it was a good start I believe we're living in a very wonderful glorious day of opportunity when people of this day living to see the Shadows of the coming of the son of man now into the greatest Revival it this this in 56 into the greatest Revival there was ever known amen wouldn't it be something if we just stopped there we just stop there you would think that the world was going to burst into the greatest Revival ever now it was between 1956 and 1957 all right Revival and he went and preached in America turned Christ down so much so that brother Braham said I don't even pray for it there's no hope there's not a hope for her she has crossed the line between mercy and judgment there's no coming back for her how many know those are some tremendous big words now let let me read the rest of the quote or it's it's going into the darkest chaos that been ever known in history now I have a question for you which you way did it go brother Glenn the second one didn't it that's exactly right it went into the second way I mean if you can't see the chaos in the darkness you got to be blind why now notice it's a great time of people to make a decision on what they're going to do amen how many it was a time of decision now can I tell you what my Revelation from all of this is my Revelation from all of this is is that those who accept the Lord those who receive it they're going to have the greatest Revival the Great thing ever known to man is what they're going to have how many believe you are part of that I am part of that why because he going to usher in and he's going to bring the very coming of the Lord Jesus Christ he said we're living right in the shadows and you and I as living and we're going to get to see him come in Cloud of Glory we're going to have the biggest Revival that we ever had it's the greatest person that's ever been known about and they could have all had it but they didn't have one it they refused it they rejected but do not have receive it accept it what a wonderful thing it is that's what I got out of it that's why we Rejoice that why we we just don't know how to act hardly huh why because when we think about the word that was manifested to us and how Christ came in our day and amen oh my brother BRS what's the matter with you people he says you seen the goodness let me go back a little can I just take my time tonight we'll we'll start prayer meeting at 10: maybe tonight or something I don't know sometime ago he a man was on his road to the seaside he was going over there for a rest and he just wanted to refresh himself because he loved the thought of what he would hear the seagulls that flew over the water and skipped down into the great white tip waves as he roared and burst in the air and he wanted to smell the salt water he said oh it'd be such a rest on that life to live that Seashore for a while and I just want to rest I want to live by the seashore to see all the things that she has to offer the blue skies as it reflect from the sky to the water how that the foam of the salt water will boil up to a great wave and strike and roll he says oh if I can just stand and look at that and hear the scream of the go I don't know about you but I can hear it now can't you Peter spend a lot of time there by the Seas has I don't know if that sounds anything like it but hopefully it's close ain't that right [Music] close yeah we know because just Oh my he wanted to hear it just hear the G of the another bird you see he had now notice he said uh and now notice he said and stand there and look at it he the scream the go on his Root Down Under The Seashore he met old salt and old man coming he says in Old Salt old sailor from the sea another place brother bam said he about 70 something years old he said where go th he says I go down to the seashore to enjoy the goodness of the Sea and the old Saul said I see nothing so strange about it amen I wish I had a different quote on that because he made it he says I don't see nothing so special about it it's just water it's just got the waters are just water Sky to Sky the go is another bird you see he said but he had seen so much of it until it had become common to him it's not amen read is but you get away from the presence of God oh this is another Wednesday night this is another Bor church service oh it gets D gets old these things get old but he should never get old to us isin't that right oh my it wasn't thrilling to him anymore that's what's the matter with you people but the B says even the Pentecost the people things are and I looked on this quote when I was looking this up about becoming common he says man just you just do one of those in Tanzania and Africa and those places and 10,000 will fall at the feet of Jesus the reality that God is real and here we sit better Pentecostals people at the Tabernacle come and say well I guess it was pretty good I guess it's all right I gotta go to work tomorrow again it just doesn't thrill them anymore don't ever let the message people would go to church people would offer your heart I believe he to come from your heart don't let it get stagnated amen I was when I was meditating on this I thought about become common become common to me is a symptom a symptom of getting called on God just like if you was to you doesn't mean to you as much as it ever did now where was we that's right Divine thing listen and divine things of God moving and work until it becomes common you don't notice it no more in the me ings I've noticed people where the Lord under discernment will speak right out in the audience just as he did when he walked the shores of Galilee just like he promised that he said he would do the first time they say oh boy did that ever that's quite something that's got to be the Lord and the next time well become and he T it and after a while well it's just another thing yeah brother brandham watch watched people in that condition let it become common I wonder No Doubt but that he we as Christians I don't care if you're a Christian whatever you are some people man they're not they're not it's past don't notice your eyes of understanding you to let things become common it's not a thrill anymore not a thrill to get on your knees and talk to the Lord anymore boy that's a real good sign that you need a good prayer that's right now listen H be on anything you walk know it should do something to you it should shake your faith till you open up Every Door of Faith and everything say Lord Jesus take full possession of me now amen I give myself away I Give Myself Away need to really do it not just a song but it's something that you do take my selfishness away take my misunderstandings away take my doubts away open my eyes brother B says man people have let it become common what they need is little eyes they have to open their eyes and realize that they've gotten cold on God churches and people they need eyes have the eyes have of the holy spirit that you want to get in the presence of almighty God we need a good oldfashioned people that know to get Amen in the garden Al while the do is still on the Roses he walks with me and he talks with me amen I'll tell you oh my does something for you brother says that the garden does something for you he preached in the holies of holies and so forth talking about going into that Garden in the cool of the morning amen when everything's fresh he says in the fragrance amen amen of the night is there and it's been peaceful and it's calm it's been rested that's the way you take a break and spend some time with God take a rest why from the things of the world from the cares of this world from the responsibility of this world take all of your prayer time away from God no wonder we get short no wonder we get sticky no wonder we get irritated no we get in a bad mood no wonder we ain't got no Hallelujah we ain't got no I know this is what the Lord laid on my but I don't feel very good at all I I'm tired I this is not going to go good we're going to have one of them hum drum normal Services we ain't going to have no screaming shouting talking about him when you get his presence it does something for you that's what we need people we need to get in behind that Veil we need experience but say man you have ever met anybody that way live on the mountain top and nothing bothers him but abam said yes you can why do you see I'm still trying to get there doesn't matter if it's Cloud don't matter with a few tears in my eyes crying I felt like crying tonight sad in my heart I said how am I gonna pre sad in Heart lost one of my animals today that I loved that's right you know I was no ducks but the grand kids kind of like got the tractor suppli kind of like we have a duck I said Ducks I'm getting me some ducks years old guess what if we're going to have Ducks we better have some ducks coming there you know and I was kind of par of that little fell he me petting him and so forth but he didn't make it that was kind of sad I thought wow you know how it is how does it tell about the in his presence there's fullness of joy how many believe there's joy unspeakable in there people don't get in there but how many knows we need more to get into there more we need that prayer Life Fellowship with almighty God shut the world off in there behind that Veil notice that you don't get this reflection and Justified just by coming to church doesn't give it to you just by Sanctified that doesn't give it to you got to go deeper than that you gotta go all the way into the presence of almighty God how many know that whenever person died we said they went on to the presence of almighty God you could all don't have to wait till you die until you get in the presence of God we can have the presence of God here tonight you can have it right now in your heart just depends on whether you really want it or not I know about I God I need more of you Lord help me to stay there to where the world that doesn't matter what happens in the world
