TRANSCRIPT
========================================

And God says, "Hey, I paid the price. My blood shed on Calvary. I paid the price." The devil says, "Hey, do you know they made a mistake?" Well, guess what? They asked for forgiveness. I paid the price. It is a paid work at Calvary for every sin that you'll commit tomorrow and then you committed in your past. It's a the cross is a three-dimensional cross. It's for your past. It's for your tomorrow. And it's for your present. It's a cross that presses all sin. Everything that you've committed, young people, if you made a sin, make it right and move on. &gt;&gt; Don't live in that. The devil wants to make you live in a state of fear and anxiety.

They want to keep you. The devil wants to keep you busy. Say, "Hey, there's a better Hey, this is church is better. This boy I date is better." But I'm here to tell you, you've got the best vineyard. You have the revelation of the hour.
