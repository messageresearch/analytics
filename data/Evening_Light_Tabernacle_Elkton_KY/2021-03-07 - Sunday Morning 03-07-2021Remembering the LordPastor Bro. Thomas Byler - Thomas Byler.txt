items they're in the back sunday school room uh i requested that we just have them back there for a month i figured that'll give y'all sisters time to to go through it they're all just for girls so sorry guys no hunting clothes but uh either way i know uh brother branham said the deacons and stuff are responsible for food and clothing and finances of the church and so when it was mentioned to me about the clothing items i said that'd be fine so they are back there in the back classroom sister jessica's classroom and uh so anybody like to go through them the boxes are marked everything is marked for sizes but brothers just keep in mind it might take your wife a little bit to go through it so give her time we don't want to end up with everything still sitting back there a month from now and somebody says well my husband wouldn't let me take time to go through it so and also for the election all the offices will remain the same i don't know if y'all know how that's handled but after all the ballots are turned in i have been the only one that looks at the ballots counts them and then i put them in a sealed envelope and marked the date on them and they're turned in to brother brian

amen different things the lord's brought them through amen so god is good i guess that'll be awfully music thank y'all amen since we are going to have communion this morning amen and the lord's supper and foot washing i thought i would try to speak to something something on the order of communion amen so if you will stand with me this morning also i would like to ask the deacons and also the treasurer brother brian i need to see y'all after service right after service if you would okay amen um one more thing i forgot i wanted to congratulate sister leah she got her uh registered nurse right so let's just give her hannah the thoughts all right all right i think i don't know i may have missed some in the past but i think adriana did she got her final teachers test right she's not here this morning so we'll wait until she's here and congratulate her amen so praise the lord amen it's it's amazing it's just it's a wonderful thing to be able to watch amen uh these children grow up become adults amen and so it's just it means for me as a pastor it's an honor amen amen to see each and every one of the parents to see what you watch your family grow up and serve the lord and watch the children and mature and and get filled with the holy ghost and amen find a kind of good job and amen it's just a blessing from the lord amen amen so let's just bow our heads this morning kind heavenly father is we want to now open your bible and father ask god that you would just lord say what you once said this morning father come in a special way we know that lord if we would just read the word without the spirit father it would be dead lord but father the holy spirit we just asked to come in a special way and anoint lord the service anoint me lord to minister the word father that lord the ones that are receiving would also father be able to receive it further than just in their mind or in their head but father that it would sink down into their souls lord jesus and we would be drawn closer to you and then into a greater relationship and a greater fellowship with you lord to become more like our father and lord as we remember you this morning as we observe the communion this morning father and do what you have asked us to do father we ask you to bless every portion of the service this morning and each one that has come into your house and each one lord that loves you in the bottom of their heart father he wants to give their all to you lord we just ask god that you bless each and every one lord we just commit ourselves to you now in jesus christ's name amen and amen turn to first corinthians if you will first corinthians we'll go to the 11th chapter we're going to read maybe half of the communion chapter and then maybe the other half amen i believe communion is something that is important to do amen because jesus asked us to do it amen the same as he asked us to baptize that right to wash feet to have baptism and so he commanded them to do that and he also asked us to do this part amen and so i believe that all christians should take the communion to remember the lord all right now in chapter 11 of first corinthians and verse 23 paul says for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death until he come amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen i want to begin with just a couple of different thoughts on this and i want to talk as we think about uh the lord's death and what he's asked us to do in remembrance of me and that we're remembering his death amen but he did for us so i want to speak a little while with the help of the lord on what he did for us amen and then what he told us some of the things that he told us amen and also what he for what he did for you personally amen because somebody knows that if what he did i mean if a person doesn't ever apply that to their life and it never becomes a revelation of what he did for them they never benefit at all and there will be billions of people like that that never really even benefit from what he did amen so if god comes down and he has mercy on you and he has gives you a revelation of what he did if he saves you amen then that is something that is special and i believe that through the eons of time or not time but through the ceaseless eternity i won't see say i won't say through the ceaseless uh you know times to come because it's not going to be time it's going to be eternity amen it'll be the thing that we worship and praise god for and that is for what he does for you on a personal basis because let me tell you some how many knows that not everybody experiences what you have experienced not everybody reaps the benefit of what he did and so as he tells us to remember it's kind of strange isn't actually saying now look i want you to do this and i want you to observe this in remembrance of what i did for you amen now we know that in the old testament ever since the fall in the garden of eden ever since that time you know that they got promised that uh you know that they would be getting messiah the messiah would be coming and he would be a savior and and they always looked forward they were always looking forward now prophet brought us not brought this out and showed us that they were looking forward to the coming of the messiah he they were looking forward to coming and him saving them from their sins and and redeeming him and all of the things that they were gonna do all right but then after calgary after he paid the price and after he died on calvary ever since then amen all you know every every ev ever since that time from the 2000 years ago on everybody always looks back we look back to calvary to what he did for us and that's what we are remembering is we are remembering what he did amen amen both in his life and in his death praise god amen we know that uh you know what he did for us let's first of all look at what he did when he came to the earth and how that we know that jesus christ when he was came to the earth that he came from god in that right he came out from god he came out from the spirit because that which was conceived of mary was that of the holy ghost so that little germ that was created in the womb of mary was a spoken word seed isn't that right it was the actual manifestation of god in a in a sun form because he went from the father to the son and then he came down and he began to amen we know it's coming from god and going on he came from the majesty so to speak of all of the glory of heaven god came down and became what for you what did he do he became a servant i mean he knows that that is what he came down and he came down and he became a servant he was he went from being the richest and the greatest to becoming the smallest all right he became the least amen he became the last he received the lowest name that anybody could give anybody which was the chief of devils they called him beelzebub they called him illegitimate they called him a bastard son isn't that they called him all kinds of dirty names amen he had a dirty name on to him amen and he went so low and he became such a servant he wasn't trying to be great and he taught us one of the things he told us and taught us he said that the last shall be first the first and the first shall be last amen amen and there are many different things that we could go into for all morning long talking about you know they that are last they're going to be first and so forth and and all the things that you know blessed are those that hunger and thirst after righteousness and blessings are those that are persecuted for righteousness sakes you know and and those that have not in this world they're gonna be those that are hungry in this world they're gonna be full there and all these different things but let's focus first of all on the servitude of jesus christ how god became a servant of all and he even said and he even told us that if you're going to be a great christian if you're going to be like him he said let him that is the greatest among you be the servant of all how many knows that that's right let the greatest become a servant so amen we're looking now at becoming a great person but we'll be listening to seeing about being we don't care about no greatness amen we just want to be a simple humble christian amen loving the lord and so that's why in the foot washing part if you'll notice you know when peter when he came to peter amen and peter says thou shalt never wash my feet why because peter looked at him as you're the master you're our lord you're our leader and you're not gonna come down here and wash my feet i'll wash yours i'll be your servant but no he says you know if i washed he not thou has no part with me amen and but he says you know in peter's mind he you know and then he actually become what brother wash flunky amen we know back in that time one of the lowest jobs you could get wasn't mcdonald's or burger king it was to become a foot wash funky at somebody's house amen just to have to wash somebody's dirty feet uh you all know hey man if you had to do that on a daily basis for you know every hour of the day everybody come somebody else all you do is go in there and scrub their feet you know we'd probably be wearing plastic gloves and everything else because we want to at least stay clean i don't know if they had all of that back then but they would go down there and wash one another feet how many knows that whenever that harlot mary i believe it was come in there amen she seen that nobody was washing his feet you're not right amen nobody was washing feet he was mistreated oh my we talked about respect wednesday night but you know i believe that amen jesus does not get the respect that he deserves no think about it look at the world everything that he's created everything i don't care every sinner i don't care every one of them they would not have a breath in their mouth they wouldn't have any food to eat they wouldn't have a roof on their head if it wasn't for almighty god but yet they can't give him that honor and that glory amen they'll eat like brother man says like he said somebody that i guess he ran into it amen at the dinner table just begin to eat you know and enjoy the food and so forth and didn't even pray for it he says it reminded him of a pig under apple tree and never looking up to see where the owl will come from never being thankful for where it came from i believe that's one part of looking back and remembering things because when you talk about remembrance how many knows remembrance has to do with the past remembrance has to do with the past amen and i'll tell you what i oh my amen when you begin to think about the past and when you begin to think about this body that was broken for you he lived a life of servitude he lived a life of example of what a christian should be i mean you can read the matthew mark luke and john you can read the life of jesus and you can know how you're supposed to be oh because his life was a reflection of how we're supposed to be because we're sons and daughters of god we look back oh my we remember let's remember this morning we're going to remember this morning because this is the time to remember now is the time to remember because there will be people that don't remember don't think about it don't want to think about it blot it out of their mind what jesus did for them but you know how many knows that in hell they're going to remember what's going to make hell so bad is the things that the people remember how many knows our conscience and our mind if it gets messed up we can be really miserable people that's right if you have a you know a guilty conscience if you have something bad things that happen in your past you know or whatever you know you know all kinds of things people get nervous people have breakdowns people go crazy because of things they remember and if you let me just talk about that for a minute remember over in uh in the bible where he talks about that rich young not rich young ruler but the rich man in lazarus i believe in the beggar you know that didn't have any comfort the only comfort he had was the dogs licking his sores ah that feels good look at some bulldog that feels so good huh but he laid at the rich man's gate you know and he would drive out in his cadillac and his nice escalator or whatever it was and he'd drive on past him you know he'd leave him sitting on the sidewalk never give him nothing never give him no medicine never helping or anything you know and he prospered you know but the bible says that he went to hell in that light and he lifted up his soul in hell and seen abraham afar off huh and he said give me a little water you know i want just a little you know i like that song it's just just one drop of water is all that he wants anymore just one drop of water even just one drop of water it's all he wanted amen but he wasn't gonna get there was a goal fix you know and amen and abraham says you know i can't help you because there's a goal fix between here but remember in thy lifetime how that thou has things so good you know but this lazarus i believe his name was he's this beggar he didn't have a good life you know and he was in heaven and he wanted him to come and comfort him a little bit you had it good but he had it bad now remember how things had and then what did he try to say become a missionary go tell my brothers go tell my my family not to come to this place how many believe that's what we're doing right now is we're telling people don't go to that place this is the voice this is when you hear don't go down that downward spiral don't go down that road brother madam said whatever you do don't go down that road you can't imagine hell being that bad because by tomorrow we may be having a funeral for you or for me you have no idea and then what you remembered whether you remembered what god did for you or whether you ignored it will come back in your mind because this is the time of opportunity how many believes we're a privileged people i want to tell you in the name of the lord i believe that we under we take for granted the privileged people that we are why i'll tell you why we are a privileged people is because over in the old testament before christ died on calvary shed back his uh holy spirit upon us before that time it didn't matter how much they wanted to overcome sin no matter how much they wanted to confess their sins and make but they'd always have to get a lamb they would have to kill it and amen they'd have to make a sacrifice but they could never change that nature that was on the inside it could never change what was really living in there that had to be a miserable bondage that had to be chains of circumstance of sin that couldn't break hello but afterwards you and i now until he takes and until he rises from that mercy that he's on now we are privileged to be able to approach his throne without killing any lamb because the lamb has already been slain the body has already been broken he has already paid the price amen amen and then that hopefully we'll get to it i don't want to go in a hurry is that all right can we take our time amen can we stay till three o'clock huh i said i'm just getting permission i'm not saying that's what we're going to do oh my when i get to do that oh my i just tell you what i think about the goodness of god when i think of the goodness of jesus and all that he has done for me then my soul cries hallelujah praise god for saving me amen when you begin to think about the goodness of jesus what he's done for you what he did for you amen what did he do first of all that's what he did and he lived a life he was a perfect man and what happened all of a sudden we're going to take him now let's take him a little further let's take him past his life amen because so he told us many things but one thing that he did for us is amen we know that he was the perfect spotless lamb of god amen and there was nothing like it there was nothing like it that god would condescend and that he would come down in the form of a man a form of a sinful man and then they begin to accuse him isn't that right they accused him of all kinds of things now let me ask you this and so they accuse you of things and and did did he ever say did those pharisees ever say well let's just forgive him you know he made himself god but we're going to forgive him no how many knows that at the time of the crucifixion that was the time that uh romans would always release one of the priests on earth and let him go free you know and they could have done it they could have said let him go free now i know that but let him go free but he says who do you want me to release jesus and they said release barabbas says he was a murderer they would rather have had barabbas a murderer released oh my which is also a type of what has happened in our day denominations they would rather have gone with man-made things that kill them rather than the vindicated proven son of god the messiah showing himself again and alive among us that same thing happened today but they wanted a barabbas they released him they didn't so i wrote down here that jesus was unforgiven he was unforgiven so that you could be forgiven how many we are human let me tell you something we as humans we have a real tendency to slip what does the bible say be careful that you do not let these things slip we have a tender thing this is things to let it slip and why do you think jesus asked us to remember things we need to refresh our memory sometimes of what god has done for us the opportunity that we have and i could begin to understand why even the prophet would tell us that we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth why because of the opportunity that you have because of the privilege that you have this morning amen the privilege because of what he did amen this duke in remembrance of me amen this body this bread which represents my body which is broken for you now that was he unforgiven they did not forgive him he was not forgiven even though he wasn't didn't really have any guilt but they charged him with sin that was as he became sin that right he became sin for us and then what did he do they went he went to judgment i mean he went to judgment and he actually suffered the wrath of even almighty god he was judged he was not forgiven he was not only was he judged but he was condemned not only was he condemned but he was actually killed is that right he was actually sentenced and that sentence was carried out imagine paying for a sin you didn't do dying for something you didn't do how many knows that that when we were yet in sin and trespasses christ died for us amen even while you were a sinner oh my he died for you he paid the price and that's why we sing so much about i know it was the blood i know it was the blood i know it was the blood for me one day when i was lost he died upon the cross i know it was the blood that's why he says this the cup is the blood of my new testament the new testament in my blood do you still remember because you wouldn't have any forgiveness if you wouldn't have shed his blood amen and that blood has the power to forgive you 490 times a day huh sometimes think god ain't going to forgive me i you know the thing of it is we don't forgive ourself we're harder on ourselves than god is huh but people give up on god is what you do you know when he is you have no idea the mercy and the grace that he has when that woman was caught in the very act of adultery she should have been stoned according to the word but she had mercy for it didn't he did he oh my think about he didn't condemn her she should have died she had been stoned but his grace reached out to her isn't that right his grace reached out to her and said neither do i condemn thee he became condemned so that we could be justified so that we could not be condemned amen how many knows he came so that he whosoever believeth in him saint john 3 i believe it is saint john 3 16. he you know he came into the world not to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved praise the lord how many believe we need to remember these things because people take their salvation for granted how many of the best thing that ever could happen to you is for god to save you to fill you with the holy ghost to give you forgiveness of your sins praise be to god how many is glad that it doesn't matter now and man you don't have to come through a certain uh temple and sacrificed all these animals it was a bloody mess no all you got to do is fall on your knees and come before the throne amen and you can be granted forgiveness and grace right there anytime anywhere it don't matter if you're on a job it don't matter if you're driving down the road wherever it is amen god is available now to you jesus christ came to make himself accessible to you amen praise the lord listen to what he did and what he did for you amen praise be to god he became poor ain't that right he became the lowest he took your judgment he took your accusation because everything that he was accused of we were guilty of we were guilty of sin lying and stealing and cheating and everything else in the book and he became our sin took our judgment took our condemnation and took it to calvary oh my you would think that if the world really would grasp everybody out there would really grasp that god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whosoever would believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life how many knows that brother bran preached a message called why and on the judgment day god's going to ask so many people why didn't you he's going to ask him why i had so much love for you i gave my life for you on calvary but you didn't have any respect for that at all isn't that right why did you not respect that why didn't you realize that hey that was for you well i just didn't think i could that's where you made your mistake brother you send yourself to hell by the judgment that you make amen so what do you do he actually was hung on calvary force he uh was unforgiven so that you could be forgiven of your sin amen took our punishment and not only that but he went to hell i mean as he went to the bottom to the lowest regions of hell he went all the way down he went into death he took suffered death farts amen it didn't work i am that one that was to come i'm the one that's heard about coming right in lifetime there why because he went to the lowest health that he went into hell but god has exalted him and i believe he's in the friend gave him a name that is above any name there is no name in all of the earth like the name of jesus christ no other name given under heaven why be who must be saved and every niche about every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord amen praise the lord i see the sign going down the road says jesus is lord trump is my president well i don't know about the other part but i'm here to tell you i believe that first part that jesus is lord he is the divine ruler i don't care what you say jesus truly is lord he is lord of all he will descend so high until the souls that are the under the altar brother brandon was caught up in that dimension about 40 20 feet up he's seen millions of saved christians and then he wanted to see jesus he says you can't see that him yet he's up a little higher than that he was taken way up there sitting at the right hand of god sent back his holy spirit upon you and me amen that's where we get into some of the things that he did for you oh i'm so happy about what he did for me oh there's billions of people out there this morning that don't got the baptism of the holy ghost don't know the grace of god in their heart they're so far away they're miserable they got to mark themselves up they got to do their hair or style they got to wear all kinds of crazy clothes every which way why because you're missing that satisfied i'm satisfied why because god had mercy on me praise be to god let's get into something just a little bit deeper how many knows that whom the lord called he also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son amen maybe i'll just read that let me just read that in ephesians we're going to get into what god knew because god knows the end from the beginning he knows everything amen ephesians 1 and verse 3 it says blessed be the god and father of the lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world everybody keep your seats now don't gonna run around too much so once you get out of here amen before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love amen we know that according to revelations 18 he says our names that were put on the land book of life from the foundation of the world god knew who would want it and who would not want it amen and he put those names down that he knew we wanted because that's who he really died for was the one that he knew that would want it you ought to be the happiest person in the world if you have a desire in your hearts and that's what i want about being popular that's what i want about being rich that's what i want above everything else is i just want to know that i know my master i just want to know him greater i want to have accept what he has done for me huh and to know that he comes down and doesn't work in each one of our lives because how many knows we all got to get down on our knees and say here i am lord forgive me in my sins fill me with the holy ghost and i'm here to tell you if that ever happens it is a divine act of almighty god it's not by your good works it's not even by your desire well i'm going to try no god has placed that desire in there already because he knew who you was amen they put that name on the book amen we failed to realize that what he did on calvary and when he paid that price and when he actually redeemed you now he knows he actually redeems you when you and him become one the holy spirit which is god's very own life it's jesus christ it's who it is the pillar fire when that little fire comes down into your heart you too become one hello and this is what he does for you amen remember what he did amen on calvary for the whole world and then you remember what he did for you specifically amen never shall forget the day amen when jesus rolled all my burdens away how many i'll never forget the day amen because i'll tell you right now i can take you to the time and i can take you to the place where the lord saved me by his amazing wonderful grace and calvary become real to me what he did was real to me and this morning i want to honor him i want to remember what he done amen because if it wasn't for that then none of us would have had a chance to make heaven or to for there to be a rapture that's why it was a finished work the work was finished isn't that right it is done it was the type host the blood is the typo so much spoken about the breaking of his body about the blood that was shed for me amen how many appreciates the blood that was shed for you praise the lord making a way for us to be reconciled to god again reconciled let's go i'm going to go to romans i want to read a scripture out of the book of romans i like the way that paul put it he had a revelation also it was paul he was a rascal he was zealous he was throwing people in jail he was going from city to city and getting christians and putting them in jail he was holding the coats of everybody that went there and grabbed rocks huh who knows maybe maybe paul was grabbing the coats and say hey the rocks are over there in that barrel over there for this man called stephen persecuting the very church of god god struck him down the road to damascus and said the very god you're think that you're a zealous far you're persecuting well i persecuted me saul saul could never get over the grace of god he knew what the grace of god is i'm is thankful for the grace of god but when we've been there ten thousand years bright shining shining as the sun will have no less days to sing god's praise than when we first begun has your enthusiasm for your salvation diminished have you forgotten what the lord has brought you from where he picked you up amen he brought me out of the miry clay set my feet on the rock this day amen i think people do and their worship begins to dwindle i was thinking you know one of the greatest things that you're going to hear is people worshiping and praising god in a church for what he has done worship thanks giving back to god thanking god for what he's done amen i believe y'all's first song amen as i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his courts with praise and i was just thinking back there and that's writing these things down of the things that we have to be thankful for the things that we ought to do not always asking god for more and god give me this and god no begin to fake him thank god and praise him don't come to church with no praise in your heart how horrible a sound is to be in church and never hear no amen oh it's a horrible sound it's gives me the goosebumps this is cold in here nobody gotta praise the lord brother [Music] buddy you better get out of my way when we get over to heaven i'm gonna run and scream and jump i'm gonna kick my feet sideways upside down and everybody do flips probably we're gonna have a time amen that's exactly right joy unspeakable and full of glory is what it is and we walk around with our faces what is wrong with us i'll tell you what's wrong with us we have forgotten what the lord has done for us we have forgotten where he has hewed us from amen oh my when i think about it i was lost and not without god or his son but he reached down his hand for me marvelous grace grace marvelous grace grace that is greater than all my sins and my failures amen aren't you glad for him paul says in chapter 5 of romans he says therefore being justified by faith how many knows he rose for our justification when he rose that sealed it he justified another made it right because if he didn't raise none of it would have been any good but raising he justified freely forever we have peace with god how many know there was a time when you and i were not at peace with god god was not at peace with you as long as you're living in sin god is not at peace with you if you're not right in your heart god is not at peace with you there's a battle raging huh because god and sin can't live together amen no it has to be dealt with isn't it nice that we don't have to bring a bunch of goats a bunch of sheep come in here and grab somebody to get a knife and cut their throat and blood splattering everywhere huh kind of nice thank you jesus everybody say thank you jesus all you have to do is have faith right that's all you got to do is have faith in what he did for you on calvary how many say i believe lord i receive lord thank you jesus listen we have faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ and by whom we also have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of god not only so but we also glory and tribulation knowing that tribulation works patience praise be to god how many knows we all need that once you're saved god does the work in you and he allows things to come your way i'm going to say it again it is good for us for something to happen that you don't agree with it's really the best thing can happen because we're going to find out just what you're made of because god knows there's a lot of things i don't agree with but is what is your attitude towards it huh what's it do to you does it get you all upset oh something wrong there boy brother i tell you what said something to me i don't well that's good for you it's good for us to get the rub the hair up the wrong way see we have that right it's good for tribulation trials oh yeah somebody to disagree with you uh yeah disagree with you oh boy we just don't like that do we why brother michael i don't care there's no two men that think alike perfectly all the time i said no well you have two different heads there's two different opinions two different thoughts a lot of times so much so that from what i understand god usually don't send two prophets at the same time even peter and paul had such disputes until they had to go to their separate ways they were both men of god that agree you're going to agree with everything but what's going to be your attitude that's a big question and that tells you whether you're right or not amen listen to this so we have tribulation we don't just glory and all that but we uh we praise god in tribulation amen knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope make maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost amen for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet pre-adventure for a good man some would even dare to die but god commendeth his love towards us that in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood amen how many believes that's what we're remembering this morning remember his blood is what helps you and the only chance that you have of standing as though you never did it in the first place folks i am glad to have the revelation to know that if justification isn't forgiven justification is as though you had never done it in the first place i love these thoughts these thoughts of god are awesome amen to think peter that i remember that stuff i remember that stuff and i hate even think about my past but i know that god don't remember it amen huh i'd have to remind him huh say what because he forgets puts it in the sea of his forgetfulness that ought to put a smile on all our faith that arabic is happy to know that if you're forgiven and god has justified you amen it's though you have never done it in the first place so if it comes into your mind just shut it out just shove it out say no because i'll tell you this that's where the biggest battle is right here the things that you allow to come into your mind is where your battle is the things that you think about is where your battle is amen all right on down and if not notice much more than yet we were said sinners much more than verse 9 being not justified by his blood we shall be saved from the wrath from wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by his the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received atonement amen praise the lord can you imagine getting over yonder we say how many was forgiven hey i'll tell you the host of heaven ain't gonna be nobody there that didn't get forgiven no everybody hey man brother bob preach it amen are you gonna worship him are you gonna praise him are you gonna love him are you going to serve him are you going to remember him amen amen amen there's going to be so many amen amen over revelations remember every whole great host was rejoicing saying worshiping him saying what else glory hallelujah that is worshipping god praise the lord sometimes let me tell you something i'm gonna work on this with y'all is that all right we're gonna work together me and you is that all right but the word is that's it you got it don't be shy oh my oh praise me to god how many would like to get the devil on the run you want to get the devil on the run you know how to do it brother madam said he used to have a dog right and he would catch possums and he would catch a you know a and everything else he'd go get him you know but man you get an old stinky skunk and he says he would you know i don't wanna look out there right but he's all you have to do is check him fritz you know but he i don't care if i'm gonna get stinky and i know i've had dogs attack him they come back and they are all very miserable right who she says take that little bit there and he hit that thing is that right what was it and that's like a amen in the church get him it seeks the holy spirit amen and the devil begins to run when you've got somebody saying that's right how many beliefs we need more of it amen hallelujah hey what but a woman screams sometimes and praise be like i didn't don't bother me bit it just makes me even feel a little better but if you dance in the spirit and jump and oh my you just do all of whatever you feel like do it might isn't going to bother me how many knows brother brandon would be in discernment the sacred time don't worry about the move be quiet be reverend but a woman scream oh well now you know that's just worship you know that's all right didn't bother him didn't bother the holy ghost that's just giving god his respect to what's do him how many will pledge themselves that when you come to the house of god not just here but when you're going down the road that you're going to worship the lord the bible says making a melody in your heart always praying in the holy ghost let's give him the honor that he is due let's give him the respect that he is due let's give him worship and praise let's come into you with thank you lord y'all must be pulling some because i couldn't preach like this if you all wanted for a little time so appreciate each and every one of y'all will y'all pray for me i'll tell you what i need your prayers amen it makes a difference you know different ones will say we're praying for you i'll tell you what so many times i'll let you all get down to my study you know and i'll be putting my head on the desk now lord jesus before i even try before i do anything lord i seek your direction help me lord i don't know what to say but i don't know what message you want me to preach how you want to preach what but here i am lord amen if anybody's praying folks or has prayed amen how many knows over in heaven it talks about the the that vial is poured out which was the prayers of the saints amen so i believe when you're making investments and when you're praying amen for me and for the service hey i believe that god begins to pour it out say here i'm hearing that prayer right now because i don't want to come up here just to give a speech or some intellectual talk or just take a certain message pick it and preach it i don't want to just do that i want to say what god wants me to say on a preach discernment that we all have need of hearing a timely message a word in season how precious it is in season because you can do that all day long just pick something of this that or the other but we want the leading of the spirit we want him to have the preeminence in our life how many believes that because of what he did because of calvary because of remembering him amen we have been brought back into sonship of god i don't oh my i just feel like i'm about supposed to be that tall in god and i'm about that tall you know why brother violet because i know that that when he died for us in that bible and everything in there when you're reconciled to god you have you you have a right to every redemptive blessing that adam lost and he believes we're reconciled back to god amen we have fellowship with god because that's what communion is really all about the prophet god said you know it's not so much a taking of the bread of wine but it's about communion it's about fellowship it's about having a relationship with god amen and talking to god getting together to church amen with brothers and sisters and fellowshipping around the word of god and speaking to god and not just praying and talking to god and telling him but he says sometimes we need to stop and listen to what he's got to say back i'm going to ask you a question this morning how many this morning so many times we'll pray and pray and pray but you don't give it 30 seconds to a minute to listen and be quiet and hear back because the prophet of god said he said he was he was horrible about not doing it and he says when he would do it he received some of his greatest blessings when he would actually listen for god to speak back how many knows it's important how many is guilty this morning yeah we pray but i don't listen enough my mind my hands are up y'all say my prayer and amen i'm gone no stay there and listen see what because how many believes god wants to speak to you he wants to speak to you any of us that are spiritual know that god can speak to you in many different ways many different ways he can use a tape he can use the bible he can use your brother he can use his answer he can use the pastor he can use many different he can use the you know things that are happening in your life he can use nature he can use whatever but when you hear that voice and you know it's god speaking me and my wife we was in a situation here in the last few days and i didn't know what to do with it you know do i do it this way do i do it that way do i do it this way i don't know just how to treat this situation but i waited on the lord i waited and waited and just like that little letter i wrote to you years ago when i was in florida with my wife talking about the evening like tabernacle shall stand that inspiration struck amen and i began to just say the words those are the words that i used and the things that i did and it all worked out good hello but you have to wait on the lord don't be in a hurry don't get in a rehearsal in a bustle don't do things in your own self you let the make sure that it's the holy spirit doing it and it will be done right it will come out right because he never does anything wrong amen always comes out right when the holy spirit does it it's we that fail when we get in our way in the way and don't listen like we should how many are thankful this morning we take it for granted folks but when you're driving down the road when you go home this afternoon wherever you are we take for granted the fellowship that we actually have been given to have with god sisters washing your dishes your whatever you might be doing just remember he wants to fellowship with you he wants to commune with you and there is nothing there is nothing that's great amen there ain't no crack there ain't no dope there ain't no pot there ain't no drug that can ever come close to make you feel as good as having fellowship with almighty god all of those others are such substitute the devil devil offers people for feeling good the only really good feeling is to be right with god have peace in your heart to know that everything's right everything's good if i don't make it through today it's okay it's all right because i have fellowship i've been restored back to fellowship with god i'm a son of god again he said he's restored our authority when he went to calvary what he did he restored your authority if you say to this mountain and don't doubt in your heart be plucked up and moved into the sea it will happen what so everything a name i will do it how many believe that we've been restored to an atomic back at the atomic that's why i feel so little i'm lord help me let me become into the full in the fullness of being a son amen how many with me the lord help me to be a real full son a full daughter have the full benefits of what he did of what we're about to do those of you who want to take it amen to remember what he did oh my isn't it sweet isn't the best best thing you can ever look back upon and think about what god did for you because that that new birth that baptism the new birth and the holy spirit that he gave you if you're genuinely born again i want you to know that is for time and eternity he that hath begotten a good work will will preform it i am a witness that if god has started and he started in me it doesn't matter what comes or goes he is going to finish it amen so i'm thankful for that amen i'm thankful that he told us don't worry about your food and your clothing huh paul said having food and raiment let us be content there with amen so i say this morning thank you lord for food and raiment thank you for a roof over my head thank you for your salvation most of all thank you that you promised that you'd never leave me nor forsake you thank you lord that you have got shoes on my feet you've got clothes on your on your body isn't that right having food in raiment but let us be happy all the extra oh my but the main thing is just to worship the lord it's to serve the lord and don't forget what he did for you honor respect and remember what he did because how many knows i said man it wasn't easy it was a great battle that he fought he did great suffering he suffered greatly like nobody could suffer until his water separated from his blood okay let's be honest they say it actually happened i've never seen it happen never seen anybody that suffered so bad that that actually happened but it's supposed to not truly believe no that it does happen that has to be some extreme suffering that's what he did for us so that we could be saved we can accept what he did and we should never never forget that's why we sing the song jesus i'll never forget what you've done for me jesus i'll never forget how you set me free jesus i'll never forget no never amen how you brought me out jesus i'll never forget no no ever never never never will i forget what he has done for me all of eternity brother gary we're gonna remember what he did for us praise be god you love him this morning stand with me what changed you ordered the service with our heads bowed eyes closed
