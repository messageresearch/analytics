[53:51] So, we just we're we're glad to be back
[53:53] with you. It's been a few months, but we
[53:55] we count this as our second home. And
[53:57] it's always great to be here to to share
[54:00] what God has done and what God is doing.
[54:02] And we want to thank brother Thomas for
[54:04] the invitation to be back among you
[54:05] tonight and this week. And we bring
[54:08] greetings from our pastor, brother Tim,
[54:10] and the believers there at Evening Light
[54:11] Tabernacle. And so we just we look
[54:14] forward to what God has in store for us
[54:16] tonight. So before we turn to the word,
[54:17] let's just go to him in prayer. So,
[54:19] Father, we just bow before you tonight
[54:21] and want to say thank you for your grace
[54:23] to us, Lord. Lord, I believe each and
[54:26] every one of us tonight as your
[54:27] children, as sons and daughters of God,
[54:30] Lord, we can just trace our life, Lord,
[54:32] and look back over every step and know
[54:34] that God, you have been there each and
[54:37] every step of the way. You've never left
[54:39] us. You never failed us. You never
[54:41] forsaken us. You never abandoned us,
[54:43] Father. But you have been the one who
[54:45] has kept us by your grace. Lord, we just
[54:47] ask tonight you would just come, Lord,
[54:50] and remind us of the great things of
[54:51] God. What you have done, Lord, in our
[54:53] lives, in our families, in our church.
[54:57] Speak to us through the word tonight,
[54:58] God. May you just refresh us, encourage
[55:01] us, inspire us, Father, we ask it now in
[55:04] Jesus name. If you have your Bibles
[55:06] tonight, we want to look here in 2
[55:08] Timothy 4 and verse 6.
[55:15] We're going to read down through verse
[55:17] eight. And I want to speak to you on
[55:20] just just shortly here just for a little
[55:22] bit tonight. Uh reflecting back
[55:26] but looking forward. Reflecting back but
[55:30] looking forward. Now that that kind of
[55:32] sounds difficult, doesn't it? But it's
[55:34] not really. So we're just going to see
[55:36] how the Lord will lead tonight. It says,
[55:38] 'For I am now ready to be offered, and
[55:40] the time of my departure is at hand.'
[55:42] This is Paul speaking to Timothy.
[55:46] He says, "I have fought a good fight. I
[55:48] finished my course. I have kept the
[55:50] faith. Henceforth, there is laid up for
[55:52] me a crown of righteousness, which the
[55:54] Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me
[55:57] at that day, and not to me only, but
[56:00] unto all them that also love his
[56:01] appearing." God bless you. You can have
[56:03] your seats. Tonight
[56:06] I taken a part a portion of this thought
[56:08] tonight and I'd actually spoken on our
[56:10] New Year's night and Lord had given it
[56:11] to me. But since then we kind of added
[56:14] some some some other things that God had
[56:16] kind of directed us as far as looking
[56:18] back over our lives but also looking
[56:20] back with a purpose of moving forward.
[56:22] And I think it's it's crucial for us as
[56:25] believers, as Christians to to look back
[56:28] to see what God has done for us. And we
[56:30] find here Paul, he has had a long
[56:32] ministry and he's looking back over his
[56:35] life and he's coming to the time where
[56:37] he's ready to cross beyond the curtain
[56:38] of time. and he begins to reflect back
[56:41] over the things of his life to you know
[56:44] the ups and downs to the many victories
[56:46] and no doubt he would recall the time
[56:48] brother Josh where he sat at the feet of
[56:50] Galia the great teacher and learned the
[56:53] wonderful things of God when it comes to
[56:55] maybe the denominational viewpoint or
[56:57] you know Paul were to reflect on maybe
[56:59] some difficult times where he persecuted
[57:01] the church and you know the times where
[57:03] he was in errand he failed the seed of
[57:05] fulfillment of the word he he missed
[57:07] Jesus's coming because he was
[57:09] perseccuted cuting the body of Christ.
[57:12] And no doubt he thought of many of
[57:14] battles just like we fight battles. And
[57:16] some of his battles he had chains on his
[57:18] wrist. Other battles he had were hidden
[57:21] places of his heart because of things
[57:22] that laid in his past.
[57:25] And Paul WOULD BEGIN TO REFLECT BACK
[57:28] OVER his life and you know where where
[57:31] he had come from.
[57:33] But he wouldn't just stay in the past.
[57:35] And we find that a lot of us, not maybe
[57:38] not us here tonight, I hope not, but a
[57:40] lot of people seems like they can't move
[57:43] from past failures or past mistakes. And
[57:46] it seems like the only thing that they
[57:48] CAN RECALL IS WHAT'S HAPPENED in the
[57:49] past. But you NOTICE WE'RE NOT TO DWELL
[57:52] IN THE PAST. WE'RE NOT TO LIVE IN THE
[57:54] PAST, BUT WE CAN REFLECT ON GOD OF THE
[57:57] PAST. GOD SAW ME THROUGH THAT VALLEY.
[57:59] GOD LIFTED me through THAT TRIAL. GOD
[58:01] HEALED ME FROM THAT SICKNESS. GOD DID
[58:03] THESE WONDERFUL THINGS IN MY PAST, BUT
[58:06] I'M NOT GOING TO LIVE IN MY PAST. I'M
[58:08] MOVING FORWARD
[58:10] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SAME GOD THAT WAS IN MY
[58:13] YESTERDAY IS GOING TO BE THE SAME GOD
[58:15] THAT'S IN MY NOW. HE'S GOING TO BE THE
[58:17] SAME GOD IN MY TOMORROW. SO, I'M
[58:20] REFLECTING BACK TO MOVE FORWARD.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; PAUL PREACHED roughly 33 to 34 years
[58:27] since his conversion.
[58:29] And no doubt in that time frame he had a
[58:31] lot of experiences,
[58:33] a lot of ups, brother Tommy, a lot of
[58:36] downs,
[58:38] you know, a lot of victories and a lot
[58:40] of disappointments.
[58:42] You know, he he too experienced the hurt
[58:46] of men walking away from him.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; He dealt with church splits.
[58:55] We think about the great Apostle Paul.
[58:56] He didn't have to deal with that. But
[58:58] notice we find he dealt with church
[59:01] splits within the Corinthians there
[59:03] where members of they ALIGNED THEMSELVES
[59:05] WITH DIFFERENT FACTIONS LIKE A PAUL AND
[59:08] I'M AN APOLLOS AND I'M A PETER and they
[59:10] WERE CREATED QUARRELS ABOUT WHICH ONE
[59:12] WAS THE GREATEST AND WHICH ONE WAS THE
[59:14] ANOINTED AND WHICH ONE WAS THIS AND WE
[59:16] SEE THAT THEY BEGIN TO PULL TO THE SIDE
[59:18] AND INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING WITH the the
[59:22] promised word of their day
[59:24] &gt;&gt; but he also experienced the joys of new
[59:27] converts
[59:29] men and women grabbing hold of the
[59:30] message that he preached on fire for
[59:33] God.
[59:34] Taking this word that Priscilla and
[59:37] Aquilla and moving on and preaching the
[59:39] gospel and spreading the good news of
[59:41] what God has done and what GOD IS DOING.
[59:44] PAUL KNEW ALL ABOUT THOSE THINGS. And I
[59:47] want YOU TO KNOW TONIGHT, WE CAN ONLY
[59:49] KNOW WHERE WE are
[59:51] by looking to where we have been.
[59:55] by reflecting back where our journey
[59:58] started.
[1:00:00] And I'll say this tonight, whether
[1:00:01] you're a young person, whether you're an
[1:00:04] old person, you must have a starting
[1:00:07] point.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Gideon, you're not on the front row
[1:00:12] tonight. Mom and Daddy wouldn't let you
[1:00:13] come up here, huh?
[1:00:17] I'm not even going to call you out
[1:00:18] tonight.
[1:00:21] But we find that we all must have a
[1:00:26] starting point.
[1:00:30] And it does us good, church, to look
[1:00:32] back over that initial moment where you
[1:00:36] started your walk with the Lord. That
[1:00:40] Christian journey of yours, it's filled
[1:00:42] with many facets, good days, bad days,
[1:00:46] ups and downs. But through them all,
[1:00:48] brother, God remains constant.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; I recall when I first got saved, I
[1:00:55] wondered, how in the world am I going to
[1:00:58] be like that brother there or that
[1:01:00] sister there? How are the fruits of the
[1:01:02] spirit going to flow out of my life?
[1:01:06] I know some of you got your wings.
[1:01:08] You're sitting on them right now.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Well, some of us didn't have wings when
[1:01:12] we were born.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, you had a temper. You had
[1:01:16] aggression. You had hostility. YOU HAD A
[1:01:18] UNGODLY NATURE. AND I JUST THOUGHT TO
[1:01:21] MYSELF, HOW AM I EVER GOING TO CONFORM
[1:01:23] AND BE THIS PERSON? BUT I REALIZED,
[1:01:25] BROTHER TOMMY, THE MORE I SAT THERE, THE
[1:01:28] MORE I READ MY BIBLE, THE MORE I PRAYED,
[1:01:30] THE MORE I WENT TO CHURCH, THE MORE I
[1:01:32] SURRENDERED TO GOD, AND I WOULD REFLECT
[1:01:34] BACK A YEAR LATER AND I WOULD THINK, "MY
[1:01:36] GOODNESS, LOOK WHERE I HAVE COME. THESE
[1:01:39] THINGS THAT USED TO TROUBLE ME, THESE
[1:01:41] THINGS THAT USED TO HINDER ME, THEY'RE
[1:01:43] NO LONGER HINDRANCE IN MY LIFE. GOD HAD
[1:01:45] MOVED ME PAST THESE THINGS.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; I WAS UNAWARE OF WHAT GOD HAD DONE. BUT
[1:01:51] BY REFLECTING BACK, I CAN SEE THAT GOD
[1:01:53] WAS IN IT. GOD BROUGHT ME THROUGH THE
[1:01:56] VALLEYS. GOD BROUGHT ME THROUGH THE
[1:01:58] TRIALS. GOD BROUGHT ME THROUGH THE
[1:02:00] UNGODLY NATURE AND THE CHALLENGES THERE.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; And he BEGAN TO MOLD AND FASHION AND
[1:02:06] SHAPE AND CREATE A SON OF GOD.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; GOD DOES THESE THINGS.
[1:02:14] AND I CAN LOOK BACK OVER 26 YEARS OR OF
[1:02:18] MINISTRY AND YOU KNOW 29 TO 30 YEARS OF
[1:02:21] BEING A CHRISTIAN AND I CAN SAY TO YOU
[1:02:23] TONIGHT, I'M NOT WHAT I USED TO BE.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; LIKE THAT OLD COLOR SISTER, SHE SAID, I
[1:02:28] I'M NOT WHAT I WANT TO BE. I'M NOT WHAT
[1:02:31] I OUGHT TO BE, BUT I SURE AIN'T WHAT I
[1:02:33] USED TO BE. AND I HOPE YOU CAN SAY THAT
[1:02:35] TONIGHT. I MAY NOT BE WHAT I SHOULD BE.
[1:02:38] I MAY NOT BE WHAT I OUGHT TO BE, BUT
[1:02:40] BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. I'M NOT
[1:02:43] WHAT I USED TO BE.
[1:02:47] GOD HAD BROUGHT US TO THIS PLACE.
[1:02:50] WOO.
[1:02:52] And I don't WANT YOU TO JUST THINK THIS
[1:02:54] PLACE, BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT GOD HAS DONE
[1:02:56] here at ELT.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD HAS DONE PERSONALLY in your
[1:03:03] life, in your family, in your marriage,
[1:03:07] with your children, in your church.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. SEE, YOU CAN'T CONTROL
[1:03:12] WHAT GOD DOES IN OTHER FAMILIES, BUT
[1:03:14] WHAT HAS GOD DONE IN YOUR FAMILY, in
[1:03:17] your life,
[1:03:19] in your ministry,
[1:03:23] reflecting back with the purpose of
[1:03:26] going forward.
[1:03:29] So, it's a nice thing
[1:03:33] to be able to look back and see that God
[1:03:36] had been there.
[1:03:38] And maybe some of you may be here
[1:03:39] tonight and maybe you've hadn't had that
[1:03:41] initial booster or start to your
[1:03:44] Christian walk, but look around. You see
[1:03:47] men and women who used to be exactly
[1:03:50] where you are
[1:03:52] pondering, is it for me?
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Can I live it?
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; You know, am I am I the one that's
[1:04:04] really called to live this message? and
[1:04:06] you know, believe this. I'm going to
[1:04:08] tell you now. Yeah.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; The answer is yeah.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Just go ahead and put the DEVIL ON.
[1:04:15] NOTICE THE ANSWER IS YEAH. BUT I NOTICED
[1:04:18] THE THINGS THAT I USED TO STRUGGLE WITH,
[1:04:19] my nature, my temper and the aggression
[1:04:22] and hostility. My some of those things
[1:04:25] don't just all of a sudden fall off
[1:04:27] overnight. But by looking back to years
[1:04:30] and years and years of from my
[1:04:33] conversion, I can realize and I can say
[1:04:35] I'm not that.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; AND WE FIND IN 2 CORINTHIANS 11 and
[1:04:40] verse 24,
[1:04:42] PAUL NOW HERE HE'S BEGINNING TO look
[1:04:45] back over some of the hardships of his
[1:04:47] life and he would tell us OF THE JEWS
[1:04:50] FIVE times
[1:04:52] received I 40 stripes save one. Thrice
[1:04:55] was I beating beaten with rods. And once
[1:04:58] was I stoned. And thrice was I
[1:05:00] shipwrecked. At night and day have I
[1:05:02] been in the deep. In journeyings OFTEN
[1:05:05] IN PERILS OF WATERS, IN PERILS OF
[1:05:07] ROBBERS, in perils of my own countrymen,
[1:05:09] in perils of the heathen, in perils of
[1:05:12] the city, in perils of the wilderness,
[1:05:14] in perils of the sea, AND IN PERILS
[1:05:16] AMONG FALSE BRETHREN,
[1:05:18] in weariness and painfulness, in
[1:05:20] watchings often, in hunger and thirst,
[1:05:23] in fastings often, in cold and
[1:05:25] nakedness, and besides ALL THESE THINGS
[1:05:28] THAT ARE WITHOUT, that which cometh upon
[1:05:31] me daily, the care of all the churches,
[1:05:34] So I looked it up. How many churches did
[1:05:36] Paul establish? He established somewhere
[1:05:38] between nine to 14 different churches
[1:05:42] and he had to care of all of them
[1:05:46] that they wasn't going off here and
[1:05:48] astray here. You know a pastor has
[1:05:51] enough headache with just one church.
[1:05:54] But Paul had churches spread out all
[1:05:55] through Asia Minor. And he says, "WHO IS
[1:05:58] WEAK? I AM NOT. WHO IS OFFENDED? I burn
[1:06:01] not. If I must needs to glory, I will
[1:06:04] glory in the things that concern my
[1:06:05] infirmities. SO WE FIND PAUL looking
[1:06:08] back and he realizes, we think, man,
[1:06:11] he's the first church age messenger.
[1:06:13] What it have been to been APOSTLE PAUL
[1:06:15] AND BY THE GLORY'S victories established
[1:06:17] in the gentile church, breaking forth
[1:06:19] the wisdom of God and letting them know
[1:06:21] that they're included in the the
[1:06:23] ministry of reconciliation. That not
[1:06:25] only was Jesus sent for the Jew, but he
[1:06:27] was also sent FOR THE GENTILE. BUT PAUL
[1:06:30] IS TELLING US THAT HIS LIFE IT HE
[1:06:32] ENDURED MORE THAN JUST THE GREAT THINGS
[1:06:34] THAT WE SEE. HE WENT THROUGH SOME
[1:06:36] HARDSHIPS. BUT PAUL DIDN'T DWELL ON THE
[1:06:39] HARDSHIPS. PAUL REFLECTED BACK ON THE
[1:06:42] HARDSHIPS BECAUSE PAUL HAD A COMMISSION.
[1:06:45] AND EACH OF YOU HERE TONIGHT, WE HAVE A
[1:06:47] COMMISSION. AND IT'S ONWARD CHRISTIAN
[1:06:49] SOLDIERS.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LOOKING BACK TO STAY IN THE
[1:06:52] REARVIEW MIRROR, BUT WE'RE LOOKING BACK
[1:06:54] TO SAY, "GOD HAD BROUGHT ME THROUGH IT.
[1:06:56] IF GOD DID IT THEN, THEN GOD CAN DO IT
[1:06:58] NOW. AND GOT TO DO IT TOMORROW. IF GOD
[1:07:01] SAVED ME, GOD CAN SAVE MY CHILDREN. IF
[1:07:03] GOD HEALED ME, GOD CAN HEAL THE NEXT
[1:07:05] PERSON.
[1:07:11] Paul would say it like this. I see more
[1:07:14] clearly now than what I could see in the
[1:07:17] moment.
[1:07:19] You know, when you're in the moment, you
[1:07:20] don't see things clearly,
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:23] because you're caught up with emotion
[1:07:26] and hormones and just everything hitting
[1:07:30] and flooding YOU. BUT PAUL WOULD SAY THE
[1:07:33] THINGS THAT I THAT THAT YOU KNOW NOW
[1:07:35] LOOKING BACK I CAN SEE CLEARLY now what
[1:07:39] I couldn't see in the moment that it was
[1:07:40] God's power sustaining me and not my own
[1:07:44] power. A lot of times we think well
[1:07:46] we're, you know, WE'RE BARELY WE'RE MEN.
[1:07:49] GIDEON, WE'RE MEN.
[1:07:51] WE CAN DO IT, but it ain't us in our
[1:07:54] human abilities.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; It's not how smart we are, how
[1:07:58] intelligent we are, how good-looking we
[1:08:00] are,
[1:08:01] or how not good-looking we are. Some of
[1:08:04] us just have to struggle through life.
[1:08:08] You know, how much hair we got or don't
[1:08:10] have, you know, I mean, you know,
[1:08:13] but it was God's power that sustained
[1:08:16] Paul in his journey. And it's God's
[1:08:20] power that sustains us in our journey.
[1:08:23] AND PAUL WOULD SAY, "I'VE KNOWN HUNGER,
[1:08:27] but I've also known abundance.
[1:08:30] I'VE PREACHED TO CROWDS that listen
[1:08:32] eagerly,
[1:08:34] evening like tabernacle. Then I preached
[1:08:36] to crowds that would drag me away and
[1:08:38] try to stone me. I planted churches with
[1:08:41] trembling hands, trusting the spirit to
[1:08:44] do what man can never do, and that's to
[1:08:46] transform hearts and to knit communities
[1:08:48] together and raise leaders from ordinary
[1:08:50] men and women and to bring churches
[1:08:52] together and people back together. God's
[1:08:56] looking at these things and Paul is
[1:08:58] saying, "This is what God has done."
[1:09:02] And you think, what does what does Paul
[1:09:05] cherish the most, brother Josh?
[1:09:08] Oh, truly it's it's having his name all
[1:09:12] over Asia Minor. Here comes the apostle.
[1:09:16] You know, Paul is different than men
[1:09:18] today. Men today, they want to they want
[1:09:20] to oversee all kinds of things and have
[1:09:22] their names on billboards and lights
[1:09:24] and, you know, be the who's who among
[1:09:26] the message or whatever it may be. AND
[1:09:29] WHEN MAN TAKES THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE
[1:09:31] toward the ministry, then that man has
[1:09:33] gotten out of line with the word OF GOD.
[1:09:36] BUT WE FIND THE THING THAT PAUL
[1:09:37] CHERISHED MOST. IT WASN'T THE MOUTHS
[1:09:39] THAT HE TRAVELED. IT WASN'T THE GREAT
[1:09:41] SERMONS THAT HE PREACHED ESTABLISHING
[1:09:44] DOCTRINES AND ORDER AND church
[1:09:46] leadership and things of that na nature.
[1:09:49] BUT THE THING THAT PAUL CHERISHED THE
[1:09:51] MOST WAS THE FACES OF HIS BROTHERS AND
[1:09:53] SISTERS.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; PAUL LOOKED INTO THE EYES OF THOSE THAT
[1:09:57] HE preached to and he COULD SEE THEM
[1:10:00] GRABBING HOLD OF THE WORD. AND THAT'S
[1:10:02] WHAT PAUL CHERISHED THE MOST.
[1:10:05] IT WASN'T THE 14 CHURCHES, BUT IT WAS
[1:10:07] THEIR FAITH. IT WAS THEIR PERSEVERANCE.
[1:10:09] IT WAS THEIR LOVE. AND THAT WAS HIS
[1:10:12] CROWN AND his joy.
[1:10:17] And he could say it like this. I see now
[1:10:20] that it wasn't the fruit of my clever
[1:10:22] words. I didn't come to you with
[1:10:24] enticing words of man, but in power and
[1:10:27] in demonstration.
[1:10:29] See, Paul would say it again like this.
[1:10:32] It was never me, but it was Christ in
[1:10:35] me.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; SO WE FIND HIM HERE. He is sitting in a
[1:10:42] Roman cell,
[1:10:45] dim lit, maybe musty smelling,
[1:10:49] had a parchment before him, chains on
[1:10:52] his wrist, and he hears the distant
[1:10:55] sounds of the city. And all this he
[1:10:57] knows, I'm coming to my end. I don't
[1:11:01] have many more days ahead.
[1:11:04] They're going to crucify me. They're
[1:11:05] going to kill me. They're going to
[1:11:06] destroy me. But he reflects not on fame,
[1:11:11] not on accomplishments, not on the
[1:11:13] numerous churches that he's established,
[1:11:16] not on all the miles that he traveled,
[1:11:19] but he reflects back on it was never my
[1:11:22] strength that carried the ministry. It
[1:11:24] was always him.
[1:11:27] See, Paul no doubt remembers that
[1:11:30] infamous or maybe not even infamous, but
[1:11:32] the famous night or the night that would
[1:11:34] live in in his memory the most would be
[1:11:37] the night on his way to Damascus when he
[1:11:40] was ambushed by grace.
[1:11:42] And here he was going to persecute the
[1:11:45] church.
[1:11:47] And yet God overtook him and changed his
[1:11:50] nature and and took the one that would
[1:11:52] be a persecutor and now he would be a
[1:11:54] presenter of the gospel. Now he would be
[1:11:57] the one that would that would teach to
[1:11:59] Gentiles that they have a inclusion into
[1:12:02] the economy of God. You know he would
[1:12:04] remember, you know, the churches that he
[1:12:06] started with trembling hands, the nights
[1:12:08] that he spent in prayer, tears shed over
[1:12:12] believers that maybe he walked away from
[1:12:14] them.
[1:12:16] He remembers beatings and shipwrecks and
[1:12:18] hungers and loneliness. And yet through
[1:12:21] it all, it was God's power. And God's
[1:12:25] power was made perfect in Paul's
[1:12:27] weakness. And anytime we can humble
[1:12:29] ourselves to God and give God our
[1:12:32] weakness, God can become strength.
[1:12:36] Young people, I know young boys
[1:12:38] especially, one of the greatest things
[1:12:40] that you'll ever learn is how to submit
[1:12:42] your weakness to God. And let me tell
[1:12:45] you, we all have a different weakness.
[1:12:48] Some of you it may be vanity. Some of
[1:12:49] you it may be this or that or the other.
[1:12:51] But if you can ever surrender that thing
[1:12:53] to God, God becomes strength in your
[1:12:56] life.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Paul, if he would speak to the church
[1:13:00] today, Brother Brad, I think he he would
[1:13:02] say it was like this. I was not the hero
[1:13:05] of my own story.
[1:13:08] God was always the hero. Christ was
[1:13:11] always the hero. And he would say,"I
[1:13:14] planted." Because part Paul had a part
[1:13:17] to play in a ministry.
[1:13:19] I PLANTED. APOLLOS WATERED. But only God
[1:13:23] made anything grow. God gave to
[1:13:26] increase. Every step I took, every
[1:13:28] sermon that I ever preached, every soul
[1:13:30] that was ever transformed, it was not
[1:13:32] because of my intellect and my great
[1:13:34] abilities, but it because Christ was in
[1:13:37] me
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; and he was manifesting his life through
[1:13:40] me.
[1:13:42] And we can go a lot of places in life
[1:13:45] and we can do a lot of great things, but
[1:13:48] it's only those things that we do for
[1:13:50] Christ that's going to last. CT Stud
[1:13:53] will say it like this. There's only one
[1:13:55] life to assume be passed, and only
[1:13:57] what's done for Christ will last.
[1:14:02] Oh, you can you can do a lot of great
[1:14:04] things,
[1:14:06] but it's what we do for Christ
[1:14:09] that's going to last. And here he is at
[1:14:11] the end of his road, not boasting on his
[1:14:13] churches, not boasting on his sermons,
[1:14:15] not boasting on the miracles, not
[1:14:17] boasting on all these things that he as
[1:14:19] a man had done. See, his confidence
[1:14:21] didn't rest in his own abilities. You
[1:14:24] know, Paul never pointed man to himself.
[1:14:27] He never pointed man to his ministry. He
[1:14:29] never pointed man. He always pointed his
[1:14:31] believers to Christ.
[1:14:34] But here he finds his confidence rest in
[1:14:37] one thing that I have fought a good
[1:14:40] fight
[1:14:43] and I have finished
[1:14:45] my race.
[1:14:48] But more than anything, Paul would say
[1:14:50] it like this and I kept the faith. So
[1:14:53] through all the ups and all the lows,
[1:14:56] the difficult moments for the Glenn, the
[1:15:00] hard times,
[1:15:01] times where you question, can I make it?
[1:15:04] Paul said, I kept the faith.
[1:15:07] So he's looking back because he knows
[1:15:10] where he's about to head.
[1:15:13] Everything that he has given, all of his
[1:15:15] energies, 34 to 33 years of ministry,
[1:15:19] Paul is about to step into his reward.
[1:15:22] and he's reflecting back to move
[1:15:26] forward.
[1:15:29] And see, Paul's life reminds us that
[1:15:31] ministry is not measured by ease or
[1:15:34] success, but ministry, brother Brad, is
[1:15:37] measured by one thing, and that is
[1:15:39] faithfulness and endurance.
[1:15:43] faithfulness to the call, to the
[1:15:45] commission, and endurance to hold out
[1:15:48] even during difficult moments.
[1:15:51] See, Paul was saying, "It's God's grace
[1:15:53] that carried me, and the glory belongs
[1:15:55] to him alone. It's been never been about
[1:15:57] me." And if you look in different
[1:15:59] scriptures here, 2 Corinthians 5:20,
[1:16:02] Paul will say it like this. Now then, we
[1:16:04] are ambassadors for Christ as though God
[1:16:07] did beseech you by us. We pray you in
[1:16:09] Christstead be reconciled to God not
[1:16:12] pointing man to himself. Then we find in
[1:16:15] Romans 1 1-5 there Paul declares his
[1:16:17] calling as an apostle set apart for the
[1:16:20] gospel receiving grace and apostilhip to
[1:16:23] call Gentiles to obedience through
[1:16:25] faith. Notice he's not saying this is
[1:16:27] all about me. But God is using me in
[1:16:30] this ministry for the Gentiles. Then we
[1:16:33] find in Acts 20 and 22 and 24 Paul
[1:16:35] speaks of his desire to finish his
[1:16:38] course and ministry testifying to THE
[1:16:40] GOSPEL OF GOD'S GRACE THROUGH his his
[1:16:43] expects of suffering. And then in 2
[1:16:45] Timothy 2 and2 he instructs TIMOTHY TO
[1:16:48] ENTRUST THE GOSPEL TO RELIABLE PEOPLE
[1:16:51] WHO WILL BE QUALIFIED TO TEACH OTHERS
[1:16:54] highlighting equipping future leaders.
[1:16:56] Notice Paul is TELLING IT AIN'T ABOUT
[1:16:58] ANY ONE MAN, BUT PREPARE THAT GENERATION
[1:17:01] FOR THEIR TOMORROW.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; And that's WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE'RE NOT
[1:17:06] PREACHING ABOUT OURSELVES AND YOU GOT TO
[1:17:08] GET MY TAPES AND YOU GOT TO BE UNDER MY
[1:17:10] MINISTRY AND IT'S ALL ABOUT ME ME. IT
[1:17:13] AIN'T ABOUT ANY MAN, BUT IT'S ABOUT
[1:17:15] CHRIST. AND IF WE CAN TEACH THE NEXT
[1:17:17] GENERATION AND POINT THE NEXT GENERATION
[1:17:20] TO THAT SAVIOR, TO THAT HEALER, TO THAT
[1:17:23] REDEEMER, THEN WE HAVE DONE OUR JOB AS
[1:17:25] APOSTLES OF GOD. WE HAVE DONE OUR JOB AS
[1:17:28] MINISTERS, AS MOTHERS AND FATHERS TO
[1:17:31] MAKE SURE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY GET
[1:17:32] BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THEY HAVE
[1:17:35] AN ANCHOR, SURE AND STEADFAST. IN THE
[1:17:37] HIGH TIMES, THEY REJOICE. IN THE LOW
[1:17:39] TIMES, THEY REMAIN FAITHFUL.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; That's what it's about.
[1:17:48] We look in numbers here. We're going to
[1:17:50] take a little detour just for a second
[1:17:51] to kind of catapult us forward here.
[1:17:55] NUMBERS IN 21 AND5 SAID, "THE people
[1:17:57] spake against mo against God and against
[1:18:00] Moses. And wherefore have you brought us
[1:18:03] out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?"
[1:18:05] Could you imagine being a part of that
[1:18:07] two million?
[1:18:09] Man, my old nature would have kind of
[1:18:11] reared up. I'd have punched some people
[1:18:13] for Jesus.
[1:18:15] He wasn't even around yet.
[1:18:19] Well, BUT HE THEN NOTICE, "WHEREFORE
[1:18:22] HAVE YOU BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT TO DINE
[1:18:24] WITH US? FOR THERE IS NO BREAD,
[1:18:27] NEITHER IS ANY WATER, AND OUR SOUL
[1:18:29] LOATHE this light bread." I'm like,
[1:18:32] "Joker, you better BE GLAD YOU GOT
[1:18:33] SOMETHING TO EAT."
[1:18:37] I wouldn't had a time, me and Moses, we
[1:18:39] we would encourage one another all the
[1:18:42] more.
[1:18:43] AND THE LORD SENT FIERY serpents
[1:18:47] among the people and they bit the
[1:18:49] people. And much people of Israel died.
[1:18:52] Why? Because of their rebellion. Because
[1:18:55] they failed to reflect on where God had
[1:18:57] brought them from. And all they could do
[1:18:59] is murmur and complain in the moment.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Because they failed to see that God's
[1:19:04] hand had been a part of their lives.
[1:19:06] What am I saying? Be careful
[1:19:09] how you complain.
[1:19:12] Be careful what you're murmuring about.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT BACK ON where
[1:19:18] you used OH, I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE not
[1:19:20] in a difficult trial,
[1:19:23] but you're not where you used to be.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You're not in Egypt
[1:19:27] anymore.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. WE HAVE COME OUT OF EGYPT.
[1:19:31] WE'RE NO LONGER UNDER THE SLAVE, THE
[1:19:33] TASK MASTERS ANY LONGER, BUT NOW WE'RE
[1:19:36] UNDER GRACE. GRACE. AMEN.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; NOTICE IN IN IN NUMBERS 21 AND VERSE 8,
[1:19:42] "AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES, MAKE THEE
[1:19:44] A FIERY SERPENT, AND SET IT UPON A POLE,
[1:19:47] AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT EVERYONE
[1:19:49] THAT IS BITTEN, WHEN HE LOOKTH UPON IT
[1:19:52] SHALL LIVE." AND MOSES MADE A SERPENT OF
[1:19:55] BRASS, AND HE PUT IT ON A POLE, AND IT
[1:19:57] CAME TO PASS THAT IF A SERPENT HAD
[1:19:58] BITTEN ANY MAN, WHEN HE BEHELD THE
[1:20:01] SERPENT OF BRASS, HE LIVED. AND BROTHER
[1:20:03] BRANDON WOULD TAKE A MESSAGE, AND HE
[1:20:05] WOULD PREACH, "LOOK AND LIVE." OH
[1:20:07] CHURCH, WHAT AM I TELLING YOU TONIGHT?
[1:20:09] LOOK BACK ON WHAT GOD HAD DONE, BUT LIVE
[1:20:11] FOR TOMORROW.
[1:20:14] DON'T STAY IN YOUR PAST. DON'T DWELL IN
[1:20:16] THE AND THE MULLY GROWTH, BUT LOOK AND
[1:20:18] LIVE. SERVE GOD FAITHFULLY TODAY.
[1:20:24] PEOPLE ARE SO EASY TO FORGET about what
[1:20:26] had got done when they're all caught up
[1:20:29] in all the emotion and all THE PRESSURE.
[1:20:32] GOD BROUGHT YOU OUT OF EGYPT. THAT'S
[1:20:33] WHAT GOD HAD DONE. GOD HAD DELIVERED
[1:20:35] THEM FROM THE FLESH POTS AND THE MUD
[1:20:37] PITS AND THEY STILL COMPLAINED AND THEY
[1:20:39] STILL REBELLED. SO GOD sent fiery
[1:20:42] serpents to get their attention.
[1:20:48] Maybe that's why maybe that's why some
[1:20:50] of us are in the trials we're in God
[1:20:53] trying to get our attention.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice God never
[1:20:57] changes his medication.
[1:21:01] If the word worked then and the word
[1:21:03] works today,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; we can't stop the serpent bite. But God
[1:21:08] had provided us a remedy to inoculate us
[1:21:11] from the bite.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Bam says here in the
[1:21:15] brass serpent. He says, NOTICE NOW THAT
[1:21:17] THESE PEOPLE HAD TO LOOK OR BEHOLD THE
[1:21:19] BRASS SERPENT AND THE SERPENT COULDN'T
[1:21:22] PRAY FOR THEM. THEY JUST HAD TO LOOK and
[1:21:26] live. AND IT WAS, HE GOES, IT WAS THAT
[1:21:28] FOR A COMPOUND REASON. TAKE AWAY THEIR
[1:21:31] SIN AND HEAL THEIR SICKNESS. THEN HE
[1:21:33] SAYS, "AS MOSES LIFTED UP THE BRASS
[1:21:35] SERPENT IN THE WILDERNESS, THE SAME
[1:21:37] REASON MUST THE SON OF MAN BE LIFTED
[1:21:40] UP." AND IF THE TYPE DONE THE HEALING,
[1:21:42] THEN WHAT ABOUT THE ANTI-YPE?
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; OH, COME ON. I DON'T THINK YOU HEARD
[1:21:46] WHAT I SAID. IF THE TYPE DONE THE
[1:21:48] HEALING, THEN THEN WHAT ABOUT THE
[1:21:49] ANTI-YPE TODAY? IF A BRASS SERPENT CAN
[1:21:52] HEAL IN THAT DAY, THEN WHAT ABOUT THE
[1:21:54] REAL LIFTING UP? WHAT ABOUT THE REAL
[1:21:56] SACRIFICE? WHAT ABOUT THE REAL HEALER?
[1:21:59] AND I CAN POINT YOU TO JESUS CHRIST
[1:22:01] TONIGHT. AND YOU LOOK TO HIM, YOU'LL
[1:22:03] LIVE, CHURCH. YOU WON'T LIVE IN YOUR
[1:22:05] PAST. YOU WON'T LIVE IN YOUR FAILURES.
[1:22:07] YOU WON'T LIVE IN YOUR MISTAKES. BUT YOU
[1:22:09] WILL LIVE IN GREATNESS. YOU WILL LIVE IN
[1:22:12] A FUTURE, A HEAVENLY KINGDOM.
[1:22:15] You will live WITH HEALTH IN YOUR BODY.
[1:22:18] YOU WILL LIVE WITH A MARRIAGE THAT'S
[1:22:19] STEADFAST.
[1:22:21] Thank you, brother Brad. Probably if I
[1:22:24] put those on, I can see what I'm
[1:22:25] preaching.
[1:22:28] You will live
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; prod
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; look to the promises of God.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; LOOK AWAY FROM THE TRIAL. LOOK AWAY FROM
[1:22:41] THE CIRCUMSTANCE. LOOK AWAY FROM THE
[1:22:43] CONDITION BUT LOOK TO THE PROMISE AND
[1:22:46] LIVE.
[1:22:52] May we never forget
[1:22:55] at even light tabernacle here in Elkton
[1:22:58] what God has done for us.
[1:23:01] Reflect back. I want you to just for a
[1:23:04] minute personally reflect back to what
[1:23:08] God has done for you. No more casinos.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; No more gambling. No more wasting money.
[1:23:16] Oh, you had some time. You cashed in.
[1:23:19] There's a lot of times you cast out,
[1:23:25] but look forward to to where he's taken
[1:23:28] us. Maybe look back to where he's
[1:23:30] brought you from, but look forward to
[1:23:32] where he's taken us.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; He's taken us out of our Egypts. And
[1:23:37] every one of us has had a different
[1:23:39] Egypt,
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; but we all have the same future.
[1:23:44] He's taking us out of our Egypts and
[1:23:47] bringing us into his kingdom.
[1:23:51] Man, think about a new body.
[1:23:54] Hallelujah. I could use one right about
[1:23:56] now.
[1:23:59] A new body.
[1:24:03] WELL, AT TOMMY, ME AND YOU MAY NEVER
[1:24:04] BREAK 5'6, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE YOUNG
[1:24:06] AGAIN.
[1:24:08] 18 to 21. Man, you thought you was fit
[1:24:12] now. Now wait till you get in THAT BODY.
[1:24:15] A PERFECT BODY. NO OLD AGE, NO
[1:24:17] INFLAMMATION, NO HEART DISEASE. COME ON,
[1:24:21] SOMEBODY. NO EYES GOING DIM ON YOU, NO
[1:24:24] WAKING UP WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, NO
[1:24:26] SUGAR DIABETES, NO HEART TROUBLE, NO
[1:24:29] CANCER. I'M TALKING ABOUT A NEW BODY.
[1:24:31] THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING. NO
[1:24:34] DISAPPOINTMENTS IN LIFE. NO FAILURES. NO
[1:24:37] MISTAKES TO BE MADE. NOBODY WALKING AWAY
[1:24:40] FROM YOU. NOBODY CALLING YOU NAMES. NO
[1:24:43] SOCIAL MEDIA POST. YOU DIDN'T GET NO
[1:24:45] LIKES. Cuz if YOU GET THERE, EVERYBODY'S
[1:24:48] GOING TO LIKE YOU. Matter of fact,
[1:24:50] everybody's going to love you.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, look where we're going.
[1:24:57] But it's so easy to get caught up in
[1:25:00] where we are.
[1:25:02] I posted on Insta.
[1:25:05] Ain't nobody like my stuff. I be real
[1:25:08] today and ain't nobody be real me back
[1:25:13] cuz they be false and I be real.
[1:25:21] But I want to encourage you as this
[1:25:24] starts, look or believe and live.
[1:25:28] Believe the word for you first. and
[1:25:32] live. Then believe the word for your
[1:25:34] family and live. Bleed the word for your
[1:25:37] circumstances and live. And believe the
[1:25:40] word for the situation you're in and
[1:25:43] live.
[1:25:45] See, Satan can throw you into the fiery
[1:25:47] furnace, but he doesn't control the
[1:25:49] outcome.
[1:25:51] See, we control the outcome by our
[1:25:53] faith, believing the word, trusting in a
[1:25:55] sovereign hand of God, by reflecting
[1:25:57] back
[1:25:58] on what God has done. If he was in my
[1:26:02] furnace,
[1:26:03] no matter what's in my future, God is
[1:26:05] there.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; I think about David. David went to
[1:26:08] Goliath. HE DIDN'T FEAR GOLIATH. LOOK,
[1:26:10] THE DAVID DONE FACED A LION AND A BEAR.
[1:26:13] AND DAVID DONE BEEN ANOINTED BY A
[1:26:15] PROPHET. DAVID KNEW THAT THERE WAS A
[1:26:17] THRONE HE WAS GOING TO SIT ON. THERE
[1:26:19] AIN'T ENOUGH DEVILS IN HELL. IT WOULDN'T
[1:26:21] TAKE GOLIATH AND ALL OF HIS BROTHERS AND
[1:26:23] ALL THE ANAKANS ALL AROUND THE WORLD
[1:26:25] THAT COME AGAINST DAVID. DAVID WOULD
[1:26:26] HAVE ONE BY ONE SLEW THEM. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:26:28] THERE WAS AN ANOINTING ON DAVID. BECAUSE
[1:26:30] DAVID HAD BEEN PROPHESIED THAT HE WAS
[1:26:32] GOING TO BE THE NEXT KING. AND CAN I
[1:26:34] TELL YOU MY BROTHER AND SISTER, YOU HAVE
[1:26:36] BEEN ANOINTED BY A PROPHET. YOU HAVE
[1:26:37] BEEN ANOINTED BY A MINISTRY. WE'RE NOT
[1:26:39] MEANT TO GO DOWN. BUT WE ARE GOING UP.
[1:26:42] WE HAVE BEEN CALLED TO BE KINGS AND
[1:26:44] PRIESTS. WE HAVE BEEN CALLED TO SIT ON
[1:26:45] THE THRONE. BROTHER, SISTER, QUIT
[1:26:47] LOOKING TO WHERE YOU BEEN AND LOOK TO
[1:26:49] WHERE WE'RE GOING. GOD HAS CALLED FOR
[1:26:52] GREATNESS.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS ANOINTED YOU FOR GREATNESS.
[1:26:59] DON'T BE sidetracked in the detours of
[1:27:02] life.
[1:27:09] Now,
[1:27:12] as we reflect back over 2025,
[1:27:15] I say we can say like Paul, I have
[1:27:17] fought a good fight.
[1:27:21] And I have kept the faith
[1:27:25] and we have fought some great battles,
[1:27:26] church.
[1:27:28] But the greater the battle, the greater
[1:27:30] the victory.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants a victory. Nobody wants
[1:27:35] to fight.
[1:27:37] Look, God put a sword in your hand there
[1:27:40] on Sabina Canyon. That wasn't just a
[1:27:42] sword. The the sword of the king wasn't
[1:27:44] just for brother Brandham. No, brother
[1:27:46] Brandon was a type of you and I. He was
[1:27:48] a He was a reflection of you and I. THAT
[1:27:51] WASN'T JUST A SWORD IN HIS HAND. THAT
[1:27:53] WAS THE KING'S SWORD, WHICH IS THE WORD
[1:27:55] OF GOD. IT WASN'T ONLY IN A PROPHET, BUT
[1:27:57] NOW IT'S IN YOU.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE A BRIDE ON EARTH.
[1:28:00] SHE'S GOING TO BE THE FINAL VOICE TO THE
[1:28:02] FINAL AGE. WE HAVE TAKEN THE KING'S
[1:28:04] SWORD. WE HAD PUT IT IN OUR HAND. WE
[1:28:06] HAVE PUT IT ON OUR LIST. AND WE'RE
[1:28:08] SPEAKING OF PROMISES OF GOD, CHURCH.
[1:28:10] THAT'S WHO WE ARE. WE'RE NOT FAILURES.
[1:28:13] WE'RE NOT DEFEATED. BUT WE ARE SONS AND
[1:28:15] DAUGHTERS OF GOD. WE ARE KINGS AND
[1:28:17] PRIESTS WITH THE WORD OF GOD GOING
[1:28:20] FORWARD.
[1:28:23] WE ARE PRESSING THE BATTLE THIS HOUR.
[1:28:27] And the greater the battle and the
[1:28:30] greater the victory.
[1:28:32] We've weathered storms. Storms of cancer
[1:28:35] raged in this church.
[1:28:39] But through it all,
[1:28:41] can I say it like this? We are still
[1:28:43] standing.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Sister Donna, I know you're on the
[1:28:46] stream tonight. You're still standing.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Some of you have been through some hard
[1:28:50] battles, Brother Tommy, with aneurysm,
[1:28:52] but you're still standing.
[1:28:56] See, it's been God's power working on
[1:28:58] our behalf to bring his desired purpose
[1:29:03] in our lives. And see, to know where you
[1:29:07] are, how many want to know where you
[1:29:09] are, then you must reflect back to when
[1:29:12] it started.
[1:29:15] Because if you're still at the starting
[1:29:17] point, you've not made any progress.
[1:29:20] And a lot of people around the message
[1:29:23] only thing they've ever heard was
[1:29:24] William Brandham.
[1:29:26] God sent a prophet. But it's more than
[1:29:29] just William Brandon.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; It's more than just God sent a prophet.
[1:29:35] God had called me his bride.
[1:29:40] See, you got to reflect back over your
[1:29:42] life, over your ministry, over the
[1:29:43] growth of the church. And only by
[1:29:46] reflecting back can you truly see how
[1:29:49] far you have come. Brother Brandham said
[1:29:53] he had a dream and he woke up and he had
[1:29:55] a dream and he looked down like on a map
[1:29:56] of Palestine and he noticed he had come
[1:29:59] twothirds of the way. BUT HE SAID ALL
[1:30:03] THE PROMISES of God lay just beyond the
[1:30:07] Jordan. What was it? The third pool or
[1:30:09] the third phase or the opening of the
[1:30:13] word? See, HE LOOKED DOWN TO SEE WHERE
[1:30:16] HE STARTED. AND BY ONLY SEEING WHERE HE
[1:30:18] STARTED could he truly tell where he was
[1:30:20] at. But he knew he was on the brink of
[1:30:23] moving into the third phase of his
[1:30:25] ministry. Oh church, we're not moving
[1:30:28] into the third phase. We are at the
[1:30:29] third phase.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Brother B would tell us like this in the
[1:30:34] message shalom. He says, "Now today, as
[1:30:37] we face the new years,
[1:30:41] I want to think of not like the past,
[1:30:43] but I want to look to the future." SEE,
[1:30:46] AS PAUL SAID, "FORGETTING THOSE THINGS
[1:30:48] THAT ARE IN THE PAST, I press toward the
[1:30:50] mark of the high calling." Now, we're
[1:30:52] not trying to place the message today as
[1:30:55] though through a rearview mirror, it
[1:30:56] would IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG. SEE THE
[1:30:58] THINGS THAT THE LORD HAD DID AND YOU ARE
[1:31:00] ALL ACQUAINTED WITH THE GREAT THINGS
[1:31:02] that our Lord had been doing and it's
[1:31:04] some of the mightiest things I've ever
[1:31:05] seen in my life. He had just he just
[1:31:07] just passing in just the last few
[1:31:09] months. AND BUT NOW WE'RE THANKFUL for
[1:31:12] what he's been. But we're looking
[1:31:14] forward. See, he recognized notice this
[1:31:17] is in 1963. He just opened the seals. I
[1:31:21] say God used him. Let me say it like
[1:31:23] that. To open the seals and to preach
[1:31:25] great words. Words like Christ the
[1:31:28] mystery of God. Sermons like uh the
[1:31:31] token which outside of the opening of
[1:31:33] the seal is the most ordained message
[1:31:34] that he ever preached. And he said all
[1:31:36] these things, but you know, HE REFLECTED
[1:31:38] BACK, BUT he was saying we're moving
[1:31:39] forward to what God has for us in 20 or
[1:31:43] 19 and 64. And I say what God has had
[1:31:46] for us in 2026.
[1:31:51] Hey, brother Bam would say, "But did you
[1:31:52] ever know that if you keep looking back
[1:31:55] that way, you'll wreck?" How many's ever
[1:31:58] driven a car and you just look in the
[1:31:59] rearview mirror and you're going
[1:32:01] forward?
[1:32:03] Oh, let me not be on the road with you.
[1:32:08] See, what was brother Brandham was
[1:32:09] saying was is that our experience can't
[1:32:11] remain just there. People can only talk
[1:32:15] about there. What God did there 40 years
[1:32:17] ago there? WELL, WHERE HAS GOD DONE
[1:32:19] THROUGH THOSE 40 YEARS IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:32:22] you got TO BE PROGRESSING FORWARD. YOU
[1:32:24] GOT TO BE MOVING FORWARD. AND YOU KNOW,
[1:32:26] YOU GOT TO HAVE AN UP-TO-DATE EXPERIENCE
[1:32:29] REFLECTING BACK, BUT MOVING FORWARD THE
[1:32:31] WHOLE TIME, EXPECTING WHAT GOD IS GOING
[1:32:33] TO DO AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT GOD IS
[1:32:36] GOING TO DO TOMORROW. BUT NOTICING WHAT
[1:32:38] GOD IS DOING RIGHT NOW. EVEN IN OUR
[1:32:40] SERVICE TONIGHT, GOD IS MOVING. GOD IS
[1:32:42] PRICKING HEARTS. GOD IS ENCOURAGING YOU.
[1:32:44] YOU'RE NOT WHAT YOU USED TO BE, BUT I'M
[1:32:47] TAKING YOU SOMEWHERE. AND IF I CALLED
[1:32:49] YOU OUT, YOU CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE. I'M
[1:32:51] GOING TO TAKE YOU IN. I'M NOT GOING TO
[1:32:53] LEAVE YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO FORSAKE YOU.
[1:32:54] I'M NOT GONNA ABANDON YOU. I'M GONNA
[1:32:56] TAKE YOU IN.
[1:33:01] He said, "So many people ride life's
[1:33:03] road looking through a rearview mirror,
[1:33:06] especially now, I don't mean to say this
[1:33:08] to hurt feelings." And this is Brother
[1:33:09] Brand,
[1:33:11] but many of our women, they're always
[1:33:14] when they're past about 30 years old,
[1:33:16] they want to go back and, you know, and
[1:33:18] be young, a young girl again, get about
[1:33:20] 50, and they still want the same thing.
[1:33:22] Not only that, BUT MEN TOO. HE SAYS,
[1:33:24] "BUT ANYBODY WHO looks through a
[1:33:26] rearview mirror is going to wreck up
[1:33:28] somewhere. You can't drive the road
[1:33:31] through looking through the rearview
[1:33:33] mirror." And today we have 50 year old,
[1:33:36] 60-y old women, lips all blowed out. I
[1:33:39] don't know how in the world they do it.
[1:33:40] We had to do Botox. They got their
[1:33:42] eyelids all botox. They look surprised
[1:33:44] every time you look at them.
[1:33:47] Face don't move. No wrinkles nowhere.
[1:33:50] trying to look like they're 30, 20
[1:33:53] again,
[1:33:55] still embracing
[1:33:57] the phase of life that they're in. I
[1:34:00] said, "Man, my wife, we're going to grow
[1:34:01] old together.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; If I'm going to wrinkle, you're going to
[1:34:05] wrinkle.
[1:34:08] If I'm GOING TO GET FAT, YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:34:09] STAY SKINNY.
[1:34:12] Just kidding.
[1:34:14] Please don't get fat, though.
[1:34:17] But if you do, I'm going to love you
[1:34:18] anyway because we're going to grow old
[1:34:20] together. We're not going to fake this
[1:34:21] thing. We're not going to try to relive
[1:34:24] our 20s.
[1:34:27] No, we're going to embrace where God has
[1:34:28] us.
[1:34:31] He So, let's just for an instant, how
[1:34:34] much time do I got? My goodness, time
[1:34:36] flies by. I ain't even got to the meat
[1:34:37] of my subject yet. But let's just look
[1:34:40] for a minute. If we don't get there,
[1:34:41] that's fine. Tonight, I want to think
[1:34:42] about Elton Evening Light Tabernacle.
[1:34:46] Elton, Kentucky. 2025.
[1:34:53] Think about where is Brother Caleb and
[1:34:54] Sister Lisa. Caleb, you're here. Your
[1:34:57] wife's not here. Why? Cuz she's
[1:34:58] pregnant.
[1:35:01] Oh, yeah. I remember Sister Lisa coming
[1:35:03] up for prayer. I want a I want a child.
[1:35:06] We've not been able to have a baby. I
[1:35:08] said, give it a name. Call it a name.
[1:35:11] Then you had your special meetings and
[1:35:13] come through the prayer line right
[1:35:14] through the front asking for a baby
[1:35:17] after how many years, brother Caleb?
[1:35:21] Two, three years desiring a godly desire
[1:35:25] to have a baby and now they're pregnant.
[1:35:28] See what God has done in 2025.
[1:35:35] And see, we get so numb to it. Well,
[1:35:38] okay. Yeah, she's pregnant. Good. No,
[1:35:41] that's a miracle. This is what God is
[1:35:43] doing in your church.
[1:35:46] Let's hear another one. Brother Cody
[1:35:50] Blanger, is that how I SAY THAT
[1:35:51] CORRECTLY? WE ALL KNOW WHAT BROTHER Cody
[1:35:55] was.
[1:35:57] My goodness. I remember the first time I
[1:35:58] met him like, man, Satan walked on
[1:36:00] earth. Boy had long hair, didn't look
[1:36:03] like he wanted to be around none of us.
[1:36:04] And honestly, I didn't want to be around
[1:36:06] him. BUT WE FIND A PRODAL. HE WAS
[1:36:09] DELIVERED OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND WAS
[1:36:11] BAPTIZED JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. AND
[1:36:13] NOW HIS LIFE HAS BEEN TURNED AROUND.
[1:36:15] WHY? CUZ HE WAS AMBUSHED BY GRACE.
[1:36:18] BECAUSE A MOTHER DIDN'T GIVE UP CUZ SHE
[1:36:21] LOOKED BACK. IF GOD SAVED ME, THEN GOD
[1:36:23] CAN SAVE HIM. BECAUSE HE IS THE SAME
[1:36:26] YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND TOMORROW.
[1:36:30] SHE DIDN'T GIVE UP. YOU MAY HAVE GIVEN
[1:36:33] UP. THE PASTOR MAY HAVE GIVEN UP. PEOPLE
[1:36:35] MAY HAVE GIVEN UP. BUT A MOTHER NEVER
[1:36:37] GAVE UP. AND NOW HER SON IS SERVING THE
[1:36:40] LORD.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; I SAY HALLELUJAH. CHURCH, DON'T FORGET
[1:36:43] WHAT GOD HAS DONE.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Reflecting back
[1:36:49] in 2025.
[1:36:53] Notice what God has done. God has added
[1:36:55] church members.
[1:36:58] Brother Devin, Sister Jana moved all the
[1:37:01] way from Missouri. Could have picked any
[1:37:04] church.
[1:37:06] No, they couldn't. They were
[1:37:07] predestinated for this church.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:14] This is where you belong. THIS IS WHERE
[1:37:17] YOU'RE GOING TO GROW. THIS IS WHERE
[1:37:18] YOU'RE GOING TO BLOSSOM.
[1:37:21] And then of all things,
[1:37:24] my first time coming here. Put my foot
[1:37:28] in my mouth. Brother Brad, you got any
[1:37:31] young girls at your church?
[1:37:34] I had to be done and show a picture of
[1:37:36] my daughter.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You say, "Come on now. She's
[1:37:41] living five minutes down the road FROM
[1:37:42] YOU, NINE HOURS FROM ME."
[1:37:46] I showed the picture to brother Weston.
[1:37:49] I said, "You want to get married, YOUNG
[1:37:50] MAN? WHAT DO YOU THINK about I I could
[1:37:52] have
[1:37:56] Man, that dude didn't waste a lick. CAME
[1:37:58] DOWN IN JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS. I MEAN,
[1:38:00] HE DID EVERYTHING HE could with the help
[1:38:02] of his cousin.
[1:38:06] Hey, go buy her a drink. Go do this. Go
[1:38:08] do that. You better sweep her off her
[1:38:10] feet. Well, he swept her off her feet
[1:38:12] and married her, moved her nine hours
[1:38:14] away from me, but God added to the
[1:38:17] church. NOT JUST PEOPLE, QUALITY PEOPLE,
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; SOLID BELIEVERS,
[1:38:24] NOT JUST RIFF RAFT OFF THE STREET, BUT
[1:38:28] GOD ADDING TO THE MINISTRY HERE AT
[1:38:31] EVENITE TABERNACLE. LOOK WHAT GOD HAS
[1:38:33] DONE.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Then we got sister or brother Danny and
[1:38:39] your new wife, Julia, right, Julie.
[1:38:43] Excuse me. It said Julia. Somebody sent
[1:38:45] it to me wrong. I'm sorry. But you got
[1:38:47] another convert. Actually, you were
[1:38:50] before them, so I went out of order. My
[1:38:52] bad.
[1:38:54] Another young believer here. And then
[1:38:56] there's another brother wanting to move
[1:38:57] here, Austin Ventura.
[1:39:01] Is that right? Speak to me, Tommy.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:39:10] So, we see God adding to the ministry,
[1:39:14] adding to the church.
[1:39:17] Then let's look healings that's taking
[1:39:19] place.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Tommy with an aneurysm said he
[1:39:22] would never lift over 15 pounds and
[1:39:25] would be on meds for the rest of his
[1:39:27] life. And today he can lift the roof off
[1:39:29] his house.
[1:39:31] And the only pill he's taken is the
[1:39:33] gospel
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; because THE GOSPEL WORKS.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. THE GOSPEL WORKS.
[1:39:41] YOU AIN'T GOT TO TELL HIM THAT GOD'S
[1:39:43] FALSE. YOU AIN'T GOT TO TELL HIM THAT.
[1:39:45] OH, YOU YOU THE THE DAYS OF MIRACLES HAS
[1:39:47] PASSED. HE IS A MIRACLE. NOT ONLY IN HIS
[1:39:50] HEALTH, BUT IN HIS SPIRITUAL LIFE. HE
[1:39:52] WAS GOING THE WRONG WAY. DONE A LOT OF
[1:39:54] BAD THINGS, BUT GOD PUT A PREDESTINATED
[1:39:57] SEED ON THE INSIDE AND TURNED HIM
[1:39:59] AROUND. AND GRACE AMBUSHED HIS LIFE.
[1:40:02] GRACE OVERTOOK TOMMY. AND NOW TOMMY'S ON
[1:40:06] FIRE. AND TOMMY'S MOVING IN THE RIGHT
[1:40:08] DIRECTION. WHY? BECAUSE HE REFLECTED
[1:40:10] BACK ON WHAT HE USED TO BE. AND NOW HE'S
[1:40:12] MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE THERE'S A KINGDOM
[1:40:15] TO BE HAD.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; We got Sister Donna's healing of cancer.
[1:40:22] Notice she wasn't given any hope, but
[1:40:23] every day she gets better and that
[1:40:25] cancer is shrinking. Then there's sister
[1:40:28] Parish's healing AND BROTHER JOHN LER'S
[1:40:31] BACK healed a sciatica. They said the
[1:40:33] only hope for him was surgery, but God
[1:40:36] came down. RIGHT.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING TELL YOU CHURCH, MAYBE
[1:40:41] YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT HAS GOD DONE FOR
[1:40:42] ME LATELY.
[1:40:45] WHAT HAS GOD DONE IN OUR CHURCH? I'M
[1:40:47] TELLING YOU WHAT HE'S DONE IN YOUR
[1:40:48] CHURCH. I'M TELLING YOU WHAT HE'S DONE
[1:40:50] IN YOUR HOMES. I'M TELLING YOU WHAT HE'S
[1:40:51] DONE IN YOUR LIVES.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; TODAY, you have an outreach team and a
[1:40:57] prison ministry.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; MEN OF GOD GOING TRAVELING TO GET IN
[1:41:01] THESE PLACES TO SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS,
[1:41:03] THE GOSPEL. And you got a church family,
[1:41:07] a unity that's closer than you've ever
[1:41:09] been before.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[1:41:16] Come on.
[1:41:18] Closer than you've ever been before.
[1:41:23] YEAH, YOU MIGHT AS WELL REJOICE
[1:41:26] BECAUSE 2025 IS NOT JUST A STANDARD.
[1:41:30] WE'RE GOING FORWARD, CHURCH. WE'RE NOT
[1:41:32] REGRESSING. WE'RE NOT GOING BACKWARDS,
[1:41:34] BUT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. WHAT GOD DONE
[1:41:37] THIS PAST YEAR, I SAY LOOK FORWARD TO
[1:41:39] WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO TOMORROW. WHAT
[1:41:41] HE'S GOING TO DO THE NEXT WEEK, WHAT
[1:41:43] HE'S GOING TO DO IN THE NEXT SERVICE.
[1:41:44] WHAT IS GOD GOING TO DO IN 2026?
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; I SAY, LORD, BE IT UNTO ME IN 2026. LET
[1:41:52] THE POWER OF GOD FALL. LET ME WORSHIP
[1:41:55] GOD UNRESERVABLY. LET ME BE RELENTLESS
[1:41:59] IN MY PRAYER LIFE.
[1:42:06] 2026, watch out.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; And think about it. It ain't because
[1:42:16] it's all been about one man.
[1:42:19] Paul said, "I planted."
[1:42:22] And you have a pastor here for 30
[1:42:25] something years been planting and
[1:42:28] planting and planting. Let me tell you,
[1:42:31] there's been a lot of scorching summers,
[1:42:33] but plant,
[1:42:35] a lot of failed crops, but plant and
[1:42:39] plant and plant and plant year after
[1:42:44] year. No help. No support. Come on.
[1:42:49] Plant, plant, plant, plant. LAY THE
[1:42:53] WORD, LAY THE WORD, LAY THE WORD, LAY
[1:42:55] THE WORD. BUT WHAT HAPPENED? THEN THERE
[1:42:58] COME APOLLOS. THEN THERE COME A BREAD.
[1:43:01] THEN THERE COME ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER
[1:43:03] ONE. WHEN THEY DO THEY BEGIN TO POUR THE
[1:43:05] WATER ON IT.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; I PLANTED BUT APOLLOPS WATERED AND THIS
[1:43:10] ONE WATERED AND THAT ONE WATERED AND
[1:43:12] THAT MINISTRY HELPED AND THAT MINISTRY
[1:43:14] HELPED AND YOU HAD AN ANDREW SPENCER AND
[1:43:16] YOU HAD A MATT MCCCLARD AND YOU HAD A
[1:43:18] TIMOTHY PUIT AND YOU HAD A JOE ADAMS AND
[1:43:20] YOU HAD ANDREW GLOVER AND YOU HAD THIS
[1:43:22] ONE AND YOU HAD THAT. WHAT DID THEY DO?
[1:43:24] THEY WATERED AND WATERED WHAT WAS BEEN
[1:43:27] PLANTED, BUT GOD GIVES THE INCREASE.
[1:43:30] CAN YOU HEAR ME TONIGHT, CHURCH? GOD
[1:43:32] GIVES THE INCREASE.
[1:43:37] IT'S NOT ABOUT MAN. IT'S NOT ABOUT ME
[1:43:39] DOING IT ALL MYSELF. IT'S ABOUT GOD
[1:43:41] GETTING THE INCREASE.
[1:43:48] He would tell us in 1 Corinthians 3:6,
[1:43:51] "I have planted
[1:43:53] and Apollos had watered,
[1:43:56] but God gave the increase."
[1:43:59] So, we look back and we see 20
[1:44:04] men of God who's labored, Brother Thomas
[1:44:06] and Brother Brad labored among you for
[1:44:09] years
[1:44:10] laying that word again. Then you started
[1:44:13] inviting ministry, different ministry,
[1:44:16] outside ministry, outside ministry,
[1:44:18] because you know what? They can't do it
[1:44:20] all. There's people sitting right here
[1:44:23] tonight that Brad Pow will never touch
[1:44:27] because his gift is not given to you
[1:44:29] that way. But there's people here
[1:44:31] tonight that Brad Pow ministry will
[1:44:32] touch. There's people out there in other
[1:44:35] churches that that ministry was given
[1:44:36] for that would impact their lives. The
[1:44:39] same way with Thomas Ber,
[1:44:42] there's people sitting here that maybe
[1:44:44] his ministry will never touch even as a
[1:44:46] pastor. That's why God said a five-fold
[1:44:49] ministry.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Some apostles, some prophets, some
[1:44:53] teachers, some evangelists, and some
[1:44:55] missionaries because it's going to take
[1:44:57] the entire solidity of the the five-fold
[1:45:00] ministry to edify the church.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Because some of you are gifted or you're
[1:45:06] maybe you're pulled to a certain gift in
[1:45:08] a certain way. Some of you love fiery
[1:45:09] preaching. Y'all need to say amen right
[1:45:12] there.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Mercy. Do I need to come out there and
[1:45:16] amen my own preaching?
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; But some of you love teaching that just
[1:45:22] grounds you and establish you. Amen.
[1:45:25] Come on. That's okay.
[1:45:28] And then we love the prophetic ministry.
[1:45:31] Well, God sent us a prophet. And we love
[1:45:33] missionary reports. What God is doing in
[1:45:35] other lands. See, it takes it all.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; But a pastor plants and plants and
[1:45:42] plants and plants. And guess who gets
[1:45:44] somewhat of the victory or the glory?
[1:45:46] The evangelist. He only comes behind the
[1:45:49] pastor and he's just pouring water on
[1:45:52] it, saying the same thing, maybe in a
[1:45:54] different way, and everybody goes crazy.
[1:45:58] And it looks like, oh my, what that
[1:46:00] evangelist boy, he just knocked the
[1:46:01] socks off to people. know Paul planted
[1:46:05] Apollos water but God give the increase.
[1:46:09] Listen what he says. Paul says in verse
[1:46:10] 7, I'm not going to hold you much
[1:46:12] longer. He says, "So then neither is he
[1:46:14] that planteth anything and neither is he
[1:46:17] that waterth."
[1:46:19] And if men would keep that kind of
[1:46:21] mindset, it's not about me. It's not
[1:46:24] about my gift.
[1:46:26] You know, I've stepped out tonight.
[1:46:28] There's never been a time that I've ever
[1:46:30] preached that I've never felt
[1:46:32] insufficient for the duty.
[1:46:35] And if I ever get to thinking that I'm
[1:46:38] able to do it in my own human abilities,
[1:46:40] then I need to step down
[1:46:43] because it ain't about our human
[1:46:44] abilities.
[1:46:46] And he would go on to say, but God, it's
[1:46:49] God that gives the increase. So now, he
[1:46:52] that planteth and he that waterth are
[1:46:55] one.
[1:46:57] Oh.
[1:46:59] So the evangelist
[1:47:01] and the prophet and the preacher and the
[1:47:04] missionary and the pastor, they're what?
[1:47:07] They're one
[1:47:09] ministry, one purpose for the edifying
[1:47:12] of the church.
[1:47:14] Let me put my glasses on here, boy. Now,
[1:47:17] he that planteth and he that walth in
[1:47:19] one, and every man shall receive of his
[1:47:21] own reward according to his own labor.
[1:47:23] For we are laborers together with God,
[1:47:26] AND YOU ARE GOD'S HUSBANDRY. YOU ARE
[1:47:29] GOD'S building according to the grace OF
[1:47:30] GOD WHICH IS GIVEN TO ME AS A WISE
[1:47:33] MASTER BUILDER. I have laid the
[1:47:35] foundation, but another buildeth their
[1:47:38] own. SEE, PAUL, EVEN THE GREAT APOSTLE
[1:47:41] PAUL, THE FIRST CHURCH AGE MESSENGER,
[1:47:44] KNEW THAT HE COULDN'T do it all himself.
[1:47:48] He needed to support ministry.
[1:47:51] I thank God for a man like this that can
[1:47:53] look back say it ain't all about me. I
[1:47:56] need help. I need a Brad Powell in my
[1:47:58] corner. I need a Joe Adams in my corner.
[1:48:02] I need Timothy Puit. I need whoever put
[1:48:04] Wayne Lawson and put these great men of
[1:48:06] God. Put them there. I need them in my
[1:48:08] corner. Why? Cuz I'm going somewhere.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; And a pastor realizes I can't do it all.
[1:48:16] Then he goes in uh verse 21, therefore
[1:48:19] let no man glory in men for all things
[1:48:23] are yours whether Paul or Apollos or
[1:48:25] Cphus or the world or life or death or
[1:48:28] things present or things to come. All
[1:48:29] are yours and you are Christ and Christ
[1:48:33] is God. So we find today that the
[1:48:35] message is not about any one man.
[1:48:39] No bishops. Paul didn't set up bishops
[1:48:43] and hierarchies in the ministry. FFO
[1:48:46] ministry for the edifying of the church
[1:48:48] and I'm honored to come and stand with
[1:48:51] you tonight and with brother Brad and
[1:48:53] brother Thomas and to stand with my
[1:48:55] brothers and sisters and not only call
[1:48:56] you brothers and sister but call you
[1:48:58] friends
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; to stand with you as we move forward. I
[1:49:04] love how it says here and I'm going to
[1:49:05] bring this to a close and I really
[1:49:07] wanted to get to this whole part but I'd
[1:49:09] be here another hour and we ain't got
[1:49:10] time for all that. But he says in
[1:49:12] Philippians 3:11, "If by any means I
[1:49:15] might attain unto the resurrection of
[1:49:16] the dead." Now this is Paul. Now he's
[1:49:18] preaching to the Philippians here. He
[1:49:20] was just talking to Timothy in a
[1:49:22] personal note talking about the time of
[1:49:23] his departures at hand. And then he
[1:49:25] says, "Not as though I had already
[1:49:27] attained or either were ALREADY MADE
[1:49:29] PERFECT, BUT I FOLLOW AFTER THAT IF THAT
[1:49:32] I MAY APPREHEND THAT WHICH I am also am
[1:49:35] apprehended of Christ Jesus."
[1:49:38] See, he realized he hasn't already
[1:49:40] attained. Paul was striving FOR A
[1:49:44] PURPOSE. PAUL WAS STRIVING FOR A GOAL.
[1:49:47] AND YET, HE SAYS, "I'VE NOT REACHED THAT
[1:49:50] GOAL." BUT YEAH, YOU'RE THE GREAT
[1:49:51] APOSTLE. YOU'RE THE GREAT CHURCH AGE
[1:49:53] MESSENGER. BUT PAUL WAS SAYING, "I'VE
[1:49:55] NOT ATTAINED YET." THERE WAS ONE GOAL,
[1:49:58] ONE DESIRE THAT PAUL HAD. PAUL AND HIS
[1:50:00] PEOPLE WERE WAITING ON JESUS'S RETURN.
[1:50:03] THAT IN A MOMENT, IN THE TWINKLING OF AN
[1:50:05] EYE, THEIR BODIES WERE GOING TO BE
[1:50:06] CHANGED. BUT THAT WASN'T FOR PAUL'S
[1:50:08] PEOPLE. THAT'S FOR US IN THIS HOUR. AND
[1:50:11] PAUL SAID, "I'VE NOT ALREADY TAINTED."
[1:50:13] BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A PEOPLE.
[1:50:14] THERE'S GOING TO BE A PEOPLE ALIVE AND
[1:50:16] REMAIN THAT ARE THERE AT THE COMING OF
[1:50:18] THE LORD. AND THEIR BODIES WILL BE
[1:50:20] CHANGED AND THEY'LL STEP OUT OF THIS
[1:50:22] PEST HOUSE AND STEP INTO A NEW BODY.
[1:50:26] OH, CHURCH. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STRIVING
[1:50:28] FOR. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PUSHING FORWARD
[1:50:30] FOR. WE'RE LOOKING BACK. HE WAS FAITHFUL
[1:50:33] THEN AND HE'S FAITHFUL TO THE BODY
[1:50:34] CHANGE.
[1:50:36] ONE thing have I desired.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Psalms 27. One thing have I desired and
[1:50:44] that will I seek after
[1:50:48] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:50:51] Lord in the secret of his tabernacle.
[1:50:57] And the prophet would preach the rapture
[1:50:59] message because he's telling only one
[1:51:01] thing. Don't busy yourself with the
[1:51:05] cares of this life. Don't busy yourself
[1:51:08] with social media and getting all hurt
[1:51:11] and depressed and down and oh, don't get
[1:51:14] all worried about wars and rumors of
[1:51:17] wars.
[1:51:18] One thing have I desired. Listen what
[1:51:22] Paul would say in Philippians 3:13.
[1:51:24] Brother, I count not myself as to
[1:51:26] apprehended, but this one thing I do,
[1:51:29] forgetting the things that were in
[1:51:31] behind. NO, HE FORGOT EVERY SORROW. HE
[1:51:34] FORGOT EVERY DISAPPOINTMENT. HE FORGOT
[1:51:36] EVERY FAILED RELATIONSHIP. HE FORGOT
[1:51:38] EVERY TIME HE WAS UNFAITHFUL TO GOD.
[1:51:40] PAUL FORGOT ABOUT THOSE THINGS AND HE
[1:51:42] PRESSED ON. YOU CAN'T LIVE IN YOUR PAST,
[1:51:45] BUT YOU CAN PRESS THE BATTLE, CHURCH.
[1:51:47] YOU CAN PRESS THE MARK OF THE HIGH
[1:51:49] CALLING
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; AND PUTTING THOSE THINGS THAT WERE
[1:51:52] BEHIND YOU. LEAVE THEM IN THE BEHIND,
[1:51:56] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:51:58] and reaching forth into the things that
[1:52:01] are before.
[1:52:02] Paul had one great aim and one solid
[1:52:08] purpose.
[1:52:09] He wanted a body change.
[1:52:13] What about us?
[1:52:17] Well, I want to get married first.
[1:52:26] Uhhuh. Some of YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, JUST
[1:52:29] HOLD ON, LORD. I WANT TO GET MARRIED
[1:52:31] FIRST.
[1:52:33] I WANT TO DRIVE. I WANT TO DO THIS. I
[1:52:35] WANT TO HAVE A WIFE. I WANT TO HAVE A
[1:52:37] HOUSE. NO, YOU DON'T.
[1:52:41] IT SOUNDS GREAT, AND IT IS, BUT I'M
[1:52:44] GOING TO TELL YOU, HIS COMING IS MORE
[1:52:45] GREATER THAN THAT WIFE OR THAT HUSBAND
[1:52:48] OR THAT HOUSE OR THAT CAR. LET ME TELL
[1:52:50] YOU THE GREATEST THING THAT WE CAN DO IS
[1:52:52] RECEIVE A BODY CHANGE.
[1:52:57] I SAY IF THE LORD TAKES HAVE THAT
[1:52:59] HUSBAND, HAD THAT WIFE, HAD THAT CAR,
[1:53:01] HAD THAT HOUSE, BUT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
[1:53:03] JESUS.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; One thing
[1:53:08] Paul didn't attempt to mingle the world
[1:53:09] with religion to GAIN BOTH. NO, PAUL WAS
[1:53:12] STEADFAST.
[1:53:14] His whole singleness of purpose was to
[1:53:17] receive a body change. And the Bible
[1:53:19] would tell us, he would tell us in
[1:53:20] Hebrews 12 to lay aside every weight of
[1:53:23] sin, every weight and every sin that so
[1:53:26] easily beset us. And let us run in 2026.
[1:53:30] Church, can we run? Can we run like
[1:53:33] we've never ran before? Can we press the
[1:53:35] battle? Paul would say it like this. I
[1:53:38] press.
[1:53:40] Just a couple weeks ago, my daughter and
[1:53:41] I, Rebecca, we were in New York City and
[1:53:44] we were around Rockefeller Center where
[1:53:46] the big Christmas tree IS LIT UP,
[1:53:49] THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. AND we had one
[1:53:52] place to go, brother L. One place. And
[1:53:56] we had a certain time to be there. And
[1:53:59] that place was hundreds of feet or
[1:54:02] hundreds of yards in the opposite
[1:54:04] direction. Thousands of people. When I
[1:54:07] walked up there, you think they parted
[1:54:09] ways just because Joe Adams walking down
[1:54:11] this way? They knew who I was. No. We
[1:54:14] had to press and we had to fight and we
[1:54:17] had to squeeze in and we had to maneuver
[1:54:19] our way to get to that one place because
[1:54:22] we had an appointed time.
[1:54:24] And Paul says, "I press,
[1:54:27] I fight,
[1:54:29] I'm zealous to get to that place,
[1:54:33] forgetting all the things of the past.
[1:54:36] All the great battles, all the great
[1:54:38] victories, all the disappointments, all
[1:54:41] the church splits, all the people that's
[1:54:42] walked away. I'm not worrying myself
[1:54:44] with that. I have one goal and I'm
[1:54:47] pressing toward it." And I wonder for
[1:54:49] you tonight, church, as we close,
[1:54:51] musicians can make your way back. I
[1:54:53] wonder can we say like Paul, I'm
[1:54:56] pressing in 2026.
[1:54:59] I'm going to press the battle like I've
[1:55:01] never pressed before.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to worship God like I've never
[1:55:07] worshiped before. Well, it's my nature.
[1:55:10] I don't care about your nature. What
[1:55:13] about him? He's worthy. I'm going to
[1:55:16] worship freely like I've never worshiped
[1:55:19] before. My praise is going to get
[1:55:22] louder.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:55:26] No, don't be afraid. He can handle it.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Well, WHEN THEY WENT TO SHOUTING BROTHER
[1:55:32] BRANDHAM, IT SAID CHILL BUMPS AND
[1:55:34] SHIVERS ALL OVER MY BODY. AND THE
[1:55:37] PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "WELL, LET ME TELL
[1:55:38] YOU, IF YOU EVER GET TO HEAVEN, YOU ARE
[1:55:40] GOING TO FREEZE TO DEATH." WHY? BECAUSE
[1:55:42] THERE'S GOING TO BE SHOUTING. THERE'S
[1:55:44] GOING TO BE REJOICING CUZ WE MADE IT. WE
[1:55:48] MADE IT. AND IF YOU GO TO HELL, THERE'S
[1:55:50] GOING TO BE WEEPING AND WHAILING AND
[1:55:52] NASHING OF THINGS. THIS IS THE QUIETEST
[1:55:54] PLACE THAT WE'RE EVER GOING TO LIVE. I
[1:55:56] SAY, "WELL, THEN LET'S LIVE. LET'S
[1:55:58] REFLECT BACK AND LET'S PUSH FORWARD AND
[1:56:01] PRESS THE battle
[1:56:04] in this new year.
[1:56:07] As we move forward, church,
[1:56:10] reflect back and see what God has done
[1:56:12] in the church. I've given you a list
[1:56:17] and maybe some of you didn't even
[1:56:18] recognize
[1:56:20] all the great things God had done right
[1:56:21] among you
[1:56:24] because we're in the moment. But when
[1:56:27] you look back, let's just play
[1:56:29] something. But when you look back and
[1:56:32] you see we started 2025, I was with you
[1:56:35] last year. Look at the difference of
[1:56:37] climate between now and then. We had
[1:56:40] snow blanket everywhere. Freezing
[1:56:42] temperatures. And today you can walk
[1:56:44] outside. That's how different it's going
[1:56:47] to be this year. From freezing
[1:56:50] temperatures spiritually. I'm not saying
[1:56:52] you're a spiritually cold church. I'm
[1:56:55] just trying to say natural types of
[1:56:57] spiritual to we can walk around with
[1:56:59] short sleeves on completely same time
[1:57:02] period, different atmosphere.
[1:57:06] And if he can do that in the natural,
[1:57:07] what can he do in the supernatural? Some
[1:57:10] of you may be cold. Some of you may be
[1:57:11] lukewarm. Some of you may be
[1:57:12] laxidasical.
[1:57:14] Oh, church.
[1:57:17] Some of you need to be praying. Some of
[1:57:19] you need to be There's more prodical,
[1:57:20] Sister Sarah. Maybe not for you that's
[1:57:23] got to come home, but there's more
[1:57:24] prodals here. Come on, church.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; There's more healings that need to take
[1:57:30] place. More deliverances that need to
[1:57:32] take place, more baptisms of the Holy
[1:57:34] Ghost. That's one thing I left out. I
[1:57:37] was here a few months ago, brother Brad
[1:57:39] and I, and I was preaching on uh I was
[1:57:43] preaching on man, don't get 50, you
[1:57:45] forget what you preach on.
[1:57:48] Quicken, predestinated for quickening
[1:57:50] power.
[1:57:53] And brother Weston met me in the back
[1:57:54] after the morning service,
[1:57:56] honest, brother Joe, I don't have it. I
[1:58:00] know I don't have it, brother Weston. I
[1:58:03] hope this is okay.
[1:58:05] I don't have it, but I want it.
[1:58:09] What do I need to do?
[1:58:12] The Bible gives us a com a complete
[1:58:15] formula. It's never failed. First step,
[1:58:18] repentance. I said, "You repent. If
[1:58:20] you've truly repented,
[1:58:22] be baptized." I said, "When was you
[1:58:23] baptized?" Was it? He said, "I was
[1:58:25] baptized when I was eight years old."
[1:58:28] I said, 'Well, it seems to be a lot of
[1:58:29] water under that bridge from 8 years old
[1:58:32] and you going to high school and college
[1:58:34] and maybe you done things that you
[1:58:36] shouldn't have done since then, but he
[1:58:38] says, "What do you think I should do?" I
[1:58:39] said, "Well,
[1:58:41] you know, we can do the first works
[1:58:43] over, get rebaptized, make a clean
[1:58:46] start."
[1:58:49] So, brother Brad and I on a Sunday
[1:58:52] evening
[1:58:54] baptize Weston Powell right there in
[1:58:56] that watery grave.
[1:58:59] And go fast forward a couple months, he
[1:59:01] comes to our October meetings.
[1:59:05] He was expecting something because now
[1:59:07] he's had a full genuine repentance. And
[1:59:10] now he was baptized for the right
[1:59:12] reason. Not just because other people
[1:59:14] were doing it or because he was too
[1:59:16] young and he wanted to do it, but now
[1:59:18] keep playing. That's all good. But now
[1:59:21] he wanted something. HE WAS STRIVING FOR
[1:59:23] SOMETHING.
[1:59:26] He come to our October meetings and the
[1:59:28] great ministry.
[1:59:30] And my daughter calls us and tells,
[1:59:32] "Man, Weston was all out of sorts on the
[1:59:35] trip home."
[1:59:37] [Music]
[1:59:40] That's what happens when your
[1:59:41] father-in-law is a preacher.
[1:59:44] said, "What was wrong with him?" HE WAS
[1:59:46] DISAPPOINTED. HE COME EXPECTING GOD TO
[1:59:49] FILL HIM WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND HE
[1:59:50] DIDN'T GET IT.
[1:59:54] Some of us come the same way to church
[1:59:56] on Sunday. We expect God TO DO IT ON OUR
[1:59:59] TIME FRAME AND OUR and when WE WANT IT,
[2:00:02] BUT GOD HAS AN APPOINTED TIME AND
[2:00:03] APPOINTED PLACE.
[2:00:06] SO, he gets home and I think it may have
[2:00:07] been Monday or Tuesday. HE CALLS ME ON
[2:00:10] THE PHONE AND HE'S WEEPING AND CRYING
[2:00:12] AND HE SAYS, "I GOT IT. I GOT IT." HE
[2:00:15] SAID, "I WAS OUTSIDE MOWING GRASS AND
[2:00:17] GOD GAVE IT TO ME ON A LAWNMOWER OF ALL
[2:00:20] PLACES IN THE FRONT YARD FOR OVER AN
[2:00:23] HOUR CRYING OUT TO GOD. BUT GOD HONORED
[2:00:26] HIS WORD AND FILLED HIM WITH THE HOLY
[2:00:28] GHOST." I SAY, "IF GOD COULD DO IT FOR
[2:00:30] HIM, WHAT COULD GOD DO FOR YOU TONIGHT?"
[2:00:33] I SAY 2026, WATCH OUT. GOD IS GOING TO
[2:00:37] POUR OUT IN ABUNDANCE.
[2:00:40] What God has started,
[2:00:42] God's able to finish.
[2:00:46] Oh, may we reflect back
[2:00:50] to where we were. And may we press
[2:00:52] forward in this new year. If you need
[2:00:55] healing, press forward.
[2:00:58] If you need deliverance,
[2:01:00] press forward. If you need the Holy
[2:01:02] Ghost, don't back up. No, you press
[2:01:06] forward. If you NEED A PERSONAL REVIVAL
[2:01:09] CUZ YOU DONE GOT COLD, press forward.
[2:01:13] If you need better finances, you falling
[2:01:15] on some hard times, come on, church,
[2:01:17] press forward.
[2:01:19] Oh, if you got prodicals that you want
[2:01:22] to see come home. There's your an
[2:01:24] example of a mother who pressed forward,
[2:01:28] didn't give up on the promise. So
[2:01:30] whatever you have need of in this new
[2:01:33] year, the Bible says whatsoever things
[2:01:36] you ask,
[2:01:39] brother Caleb, whatever things you ask,
[2:01:42] God was faithful.
[2:01:44] So we reflect back
[2:01:47] just over 12 months of what God has done
[2:01:51] in one church.
[2:01:53] Then there youth camps and special
[2:01:56] meetings and my
[2:01:59] I don't think the volumes could contain
[2:02:02] what God is doing in these last minutes
[2:02:05] before he comes and raptures his bride.
[2:02:08] But until then,
[2:02:10] reflect. Don't live in the past.
[2:02:14] Reflect back for one purpose to move
[2:02:17] forward to the promise. God bless you
[2:02:19] tonight, church. We love you and we're
[2:02:22] honored to be here with you. We're going
[2:02:23] to be back with you on Mon Sunday, not
[2:02:25] Monday. We're going home. We don't do
[2:02:27] church on Monday,
[2:02:30] but what an honor. Let's just stand and
[2:02:31] worship the Lord. Brother Josh, won't
[2:02:33] you sing us some good old gospel songs,
[2:02:36] some fast songs. Come on, we want to
[2:02:37] worship.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; How many want to worship the Lord now as
[2:02:40] we close this night out?
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Man, rejoice in what God has done for
[2:02:44] us. Go ahead, brother. Lord, Lord, Lord,
[2:02:48] you've surely been good to me.
[2:02:52] Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been
[2:02:56] good to me.
[2:02:59] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[2:03:03] to me. You have done what this world
[2:03:08] could not do.
[2:03:12] And you saved my soul when I was lost.
[2:03:15] You've surely been good to me. You saved
[2:03:19] my soul when I was lost. You've surely
[2:03:23] been good to me. You saved my soul when
[2:03:27] I was lost. You've surely been good to
[2:03:30] me. You have done what this world could
[2:03:35] not do.
[2:03:38] Oh, and Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely
[2:03:43] been good to me.
[2:03:45] Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been
[2:03:50] good to me.
[2:03:53] Lord, Lord, Lord, you have surely been
[2:03:57] good to me. You have done what your
[2:04:01] world could not do.
[2:04:04] [Applause]
[2:04:05] And you healed my body when I was sick.
[2:04:09] You've surely been good to me. Yes, you
[2:04:12] healed my body when I was sick. You've
[2:04:16] surely been good to me. You healed my
[2:04:20] body when I was sick. You've surely been
[2:04:23] good to me. You have done what this
[2:04:27] world could not do.
[2:04:31] Oh, and the Lord, Lord, Lord, you've
[2:04:36] surely been good to me.
[2:04:39] And Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been
[2:04:43] good to me.
[2:04:46] Lord, Lord, Lord, you have surely been
[2:04:50] good to me. You have done what this
[2:04:54] world could not do.
[2:04:58] And you filled me with the Holy Ghost.
[2:05:02] You surely been good to me. You filled
[2:05:06] me with the Holy Ghost. You surely been
[2:05:10] good to me. You filled me with the Holy
[2:05:15] Ghost. You surely been good to me. You
[2:05:19] have done what this world could not do.
[2:05:25] I'm singing, Lord, Lord, Lord, you've
[2:05:29] surely been good to me. And Lord, Lord,
[2:05:34] Lord, you have surely been good to me.
[2:05:39] Lord, Lord, Lord, you have surely been
[2:05:44] good to me. You have done what this
[2:05:48] world could not do.
[2:05:52] Oh yes, Lord. Lord, Lord, you have
[2:05:56] surely been good to me.
[2:06:00] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[2:06:04] to me.
[2:06:06] Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been
[2:06:10] good to me. You have done what this
[2:06:15] world could not do.
