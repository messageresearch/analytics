[42:49] Kaylee I even hadn't seen you in a
[42:51] coon's age amen
[42:52] how old is that little one now
[42:55] amen it was about a year before that
[42:57] probably or sort of that scene it's been
[42:59] a while all right talking yet
[43:02] not quite yet that's up closer to two
[43:04] before they do that amen praise the Lord
[43:07] let's bow our heads and talk to the Lord
[43:08] Lord Jesus we just come before you and
[43:10] we want to thank you Lord for being able
[43:12] to come into your house Lord and father
[43:15] to do something worthwhile something
[43:18] that's Everlasting and that's uh has a
[43:20] real benefit in our lives Lord all of
[43:22] the rest was just father passing the
[43:24] time so to speak Lord secondary temporal
[43:27] uh as Solomon said all is Vanity upon
[43:31] the Earth that all his vanity except for
[43:33] you and for the Eternal things Lord
[43:36] Jesus and that's what we come father
[43:37] this for is for the Eternal things that
[43:39] last forever we ask God that you speak
[43:42] to our hearts tonight Lord Jesus by Your
[43:44] Word Lord and help us Lord just to get
[43:46] out of the way that you might use this
[43:48] for your honor and For Your Glory and to
[43:50] speak to your people the things that you
[43:51] once said tonight father bless the
[43:53] meditation of our heart and that which
[43:55] we feel you've laid upon the heart to
[43:56] minister tonight for we ask in Jesus
[43:59] Christ's name amen and amen see whether
[44:02] Tommy brought a friend also we want to
[44:04] welcome him tonight amen praise the Lord
[44:07] amen
[44:08] amen well there ain't no telling what
[44:11] might happen tonight ain't it you name
[44:14] it it ain't because of you and it ain't
[44:15] because of me but it's because of him
[44:17] amen
[44:18] so whatever God is there's always the
[44:20] Supernatural and all things are possible
[44:23] to them that believe without with you
[44:24] nothing shall be impossible so the
[44:27] possibilities are endless amen
[44:29] so praise God and so I just want to
[44:31] share with you a little something I feel
[44:33] like the Lord's laid on my heart
[44:34] certainly is a message that I've spoke
[44:36] on before but I just feel kind of
[44:38] directed to go in this way again amen
[44:41] and so we want to speak with the help of
[44:42] the Lord on hearing the voice of God
[44:44] Amen hearing the voice of God so we'll
[44:48] turn first of all amen over and now it's
[44:51] kind of torn and I also had another
[44:52] thought as maybe sometimes we'll speak
[44:55] on and that's the Simplicity of God Amen
[44:58] want to speak on that sometime again the
[45:00] Simplicity of god let's go to Matthew 13
[45:03] Matthew 13 if you will with me
[45:10] amen
[45:19] and verse 13.
[45:22] therefore speak I to them in Parables
[45:24] because they sing see not and hearing
[45:28] they hear not neither do they understand
[45:31] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[45:35] Isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall
[45:37] hear
[45:38] and shall not understand amen so how
[45:41] many understands that to really see
[45:45] something is to understand something
[45:46] amen do you see what I'm saying no I
[45:50] don't know what you're saying tell me
[45:51] again you're telling me again all of a
[45:53] sudden oh yeah I understand now I see
[45:55] now amen so it's about understanding
[45:58] what you're hearing amen
[46:01] and shall not understand and seeing they
[46:04] shall see and shall not perceive
[46:08] for this people's heart is wax grows in
[46:10] their ears are dull of hearing and their
[46:12] eyes have they closed at least at any
[46:15] time they should see with their eyes and
[46:17] hear with their ears and should
[46:19] understand with their heart and should
[46:21] be converted and I should heal them but
[46:24] blessed are your eyes for they see and
[46:27] your ears for they hear
[46:31] amen
[46:33] Hallelujah if you're in this category
[46:36] you're in a blessed you're either in one
[46:38] category or the other you're either a
[46:40] person that hears or you're a person
[46:43] that hears but does not understand
[46:48] and if you don't understand you really
[46:49] don't get it
[46:51] imagine not a year is to not get it it's
[46:54] to fail to get it
[46:56] amen that's why Jesus said blessed are
[46:59] your eyes ears if you can hear for
[47:02] verily I say unto you that many prophets
[47:04] and righteous men have desired to see
[47:06] those things which you see and have not
[47:08] seen them and to hear those things which
[47:09] you hear and have not heard them amen
[47:12] Revelations if you will The Book of
[47:15] Revelations
[47:18] one I mean let's go to verse chapter 2
[47:22] first
[47:23] amen chapter two
[47:29] inverse now notice this is of course
[47:32] going down through the seven churches
[47:34] that he spoke of in Revelations one and
[47:37] at the end of each Church age our
[47:40] message to each church he speaks these
[47:43] words in verse 7 of chapter 2 says and
[47:46] he that happened here
[47:48] he that happened here let him hear what
[47:51] the spirit saith unto the churches to
[47:54] him that overcometh will it give to eat
[47:57] of the tree of life which is in the
[47:59] midst of the paradise of God Amen
[48:03] then in verse 11 of the same chapter he
[48:06] that had the ear let him hear what the
[48:09] spirit saith unto the churches he that
[48:11] overcome us shall not be heard of the
[48:14] second death my isn't that quite
[48:17] something to be able to hear to be able
[48:19] to hear that you're going to get to eat
[48:21] of the tree of life which is in the
[48:23] midst of the paradise of God and the
[48:25] second one unto him that overcometh
[48:27] shall not be hurt in other words you'll
[48:29] never have to worry about the second
[48:30] death now we're not going to go through
[48:32] each one of them because that would take
[48:33] quite a bit of time but I do want to go
[48:35] to the last uh layout Asia Ages which is
[48:38] in chapter three
[48:40] and I want to go down to verse 19 of
[48:43] chapter 3. as many as I love I rebuke
[48:46] and Chase and be zealous therefore and
[48:48] repent behold I stand at the door and
[48:51] knock amen
[48:53] If any man hear my voice and open the
[48:56] door I will come into him and will set
[48:58] with him and he with me to him that
[49:02] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[49:04] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[49:08] have sat down with my father in his
[49:11] throne amen
[49:13] praise the Lord he that have an ear
[49:16] he says it twice here let him hear what
[49:19] the spirit saith unto the churches may
[49:23] God add His blessings to the reading and
[49:24] the word you can be seated
[49:27] hearing
[49:29] the voice of God Amen
[49:31] my my mind how many knows there are so
[49:35] many voices in the world today
[49:37] so many different things there's so much
[49:40] noise going on in the world so it's
[49:42] because I'll tell you
[49:44] voice of God is just noise
[49:48] amen it's not the true voice amen now
[49:53] um first of all I want to read another
[49:54] one in John I believe it is quite a few
[49:57] scriptures here in John 10.
[50:04] and verse 27
[50:07] and I'm going to read it wrong at first
[50:09] would that be okay
[50:11] he says my goats hear my voice
[50:17] and I know them and they follow me no he
[50:20] said my
[50:22] sheep know my voice
[50:25] know my voice and I know them and they
[50:29] follow me
[50:31] amen we see about this is how that Jesus
[50:35] says my sheep now we know that Israel
[50:37] amen the Israelites children of Israel
[50:40] Amen in Jesus this time amen
[50:44] he tried his best
[50:47] to get the sounds of his voice to
[50:51] penetrate into their ears the scribes
[50:53] and the Pharisees to get him to be able
[50:55] to hear he says look if you can't
[50:57] believe my words believe my works for
[51:01] they testify of who I am remember
[51:04] Nicodemus came to him at night and says
[51:06] we know that you're a man sent to your
[51:07] sin from God nobody can do anything no
[51:10] matter how much we disagree nobody could
[51:13] raise Lazarus from the dead unless he
[51:15] was of God
[51:17] but there's such a thing as jealousy and
[51:19] everything they closed their own ears to
[51:23] hearing what Jesus really had to say to
[51:25] him
[51:26] amen
[51:28] and because of that they completely
[51:30] missed salvation do not hear God's voice
[51:34] it's a Mis salvation amen
[51:39] amen there's many different ways to hear
[51:41] God's voice I can use many different
[51:44] things
[51:45] he can speak through nature just not so
[51:49] long ago I've read your story how
[51:50] brother bam said talked about an atheist
[51:52] that went all over the country preaching
[51:54] amen there ain't no God and all these
[51:56] things and he got a little sick I guess
[51:57] went up into the mountains to get a
[51:59] little reprieve and so forth and he
[52:01] began walked along the great big rocks
[52:03] and suddenly he looked at me Roxy some
[52:06] question came into his mind he said
[52:08] where did they come where did you come
[52:10] from
[52:12] huh
[52:15] oh my God now everything else that that
[52:18] man ever heard not the thing about this
[52:21] how many knows that we've got these
[52:23] little voices that we hear in our head
[52:26] oh yeah we got all kinds of voices if
[52:29] you're a human being you got more voices
[52:31] than you care to have and you had
[52:33] talking to you on a daily basis
[52:36] and everyone no thoughts every one of
[52:38] those thoughts that come your way
[52:40] they're either a God or they're of the
[52:42] devil they're the voice of God or their
[52:44] voice to the devil
[52:46] amen this man back to my story back to
[52:48] the everything that he had ever believed
[52:51] before amen since never tried to get him
[52:54] to understand or to look at the Rock and
[52:57] to ask the question where it came from
[52:58] he was always no if God would if God
[53:01] would be God he would have all of this
[53:03] chaos he wouldn't allow all this that
[53:05] and the other
[53:06] all this pain all the that's all the
[53:09] devil stopped everything poured into him
[53:11] isn't that right
[53:13] but finally
[53:16] God can use
[53:18] whatever he wants to
[53:20] he can use a rock he said because of
[53:23] that thought he realized he says you
[53:25] know his another thought came between I
[53:28] believe it was invited remember reading
[53:30] the quote writers he says could I have
[53:31] been wrong
[53:33] huh that little
[53:36] thought it came into his mind because I
[53:39] have been he opened up the door forgot
[53:42] to deal with him now
[53:44] because first of all you've got to
[53:45] before God you can even hear the voice
[53:47] you got to acknowledge hey you know I
[53:49] could be wrong
[53:51] amen especially his biggest what he's
[53:53] doing and believing there ain't even a
[53:54] God he better have a little more of an
[53:56] open mind isn't that right but he opened
[53:58] it up and it wasn't long but he got
[54:00] converted
[54:01] murder came in Christ became a Believer
[54:03] from
[54:04] I understand hello
[54:06] God can use a rock
[54:09] he can use whatever he wants
[54:12] he can speak through a whirlwind I
[54:14] believe it was uh Hebrews there it says
[54:16] God in Sun Dry times in diverse manner
[54:19] stake unto us by the prime
[54:21] outfits and so forth that's in these
[54:23] last days spoken unto his by his son
[54:25] amen the one one way God used to talk to
[54:28] him with the prophet and so forth but
[54:29] even Jesus when he was here said behold
[54:31] you prophets and scribes and wise men
[54:33] and some of them you'll scored in your
[54:34] synagogue and so forth and so forth
[54:36] isn't that right so God never ending
[54:38] profits and scribes wise men
[54:41] but back to our story think about it
[54:43] there's many different ways God can
[54:45] speak we know brother abandon himself
[54:46] he was seven years old and then he was
[54:49] carrying water for his father and so
[54:51] forth and there's a whirlwind to come
[54:53] into the tree and now all of a sudden
[54:54] here the nautical voice say don't you
[54:56] ever drink or smoke or defy your body in
[54:58] any way for I have a work for you to do
[55:00] when you get older
[55:03] amen how many knows anybody that comes
[55:05] up with a story like that by themselves
[55:07] you ain't got to worry about but if that
[55:08] was actually God Amen saying that to him
[55:11] then I want to hear what the man has to
[55:13] say as a matter of fact you're looking
[55:14] at a Prof product of that work that God
[55:17] had to do I mean he's with me God had to
[55:19] work and everybody here is a product of
[55:21] that work that God had to do he's behold
[55:23] I'll send you Elijah to the prophet
[55:25] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[55:26] Lord he'll turn the hearts of the
[55:28] children back to the apostolic fathers
[55:31] amen just like they had it on the day of
[55:33] Pentecost back to the book box back to
[55:35] the Bible away from all these voices

[55:42] boys Mennonite voice Holderman voice
[55:45] Baptist Methodist Pentecostal all these
[55:48] different voices
[55:50] but God said I'm going to give you a
[55:52] voice

[56:00] story first how many ready for Story

[56:16] listening to uh Vancouver and and their
[56:19] meetings they had
[56:20] folks that come up Amen to give a
[56:22] testimony about them services and
[56:24] everything and it would be amazing how
[56:26] many of those young people amen said
[56:28] that it was something in the message
[56:30] that caught their attention and
[56:31] something that spoke to them through
[56:32] that message you know amen but leave
[56:35] that and they'll pick it up here in a
[56:36] little bit now I know this is
[56:39] Saint John 10
[56:41] amen and
[56:43] verse

[57:08] future
[57:09] Jesus is talking about sheep that he has
[57:12] in the future amen he says them also
[57:17] must I bring
[57:19] and they may hear my voice
[57:23] does that sound sure no and they shall
[57:27] hear my voice
[57:29] they shall hear my voice and shall there
[57:33] shall be one fold and one Shepherd amen
[57:37] so we see that we're even in the future
[57:39] he talked about how there's going to be
[57:40] and then people coming in the future
[57:43] amen now uh and of course we read part
[57:46] of that part of that Future's over in
[57:48] Revelations there amen where John of
[57:51] course saw and uh you know uh was we saw
[57:55] one sat upon the throne so forth saw the
[57:57] seven churches the seven angels and so
[57:59] forth
[58:00] let's get into that for just a minute
[58:02] shall we let's go back to Revelations
[58:04] Revelations one
[58:06] or uh yeah let's go back
[58:10] yeah let's go to Revelations one
[58:18] and I'm gonna let me see before I really
[58:21] get into this
[58:22] I'm gonna just touch on it and then I
[58:24] want to read your story before we get
[58:25] into this very deep
[58:27] one and verse 12 or actually let's go
[58:31] with
[58:32] verse 10 1 and 10. I was in the spirit
[58:36] on the Lord's day and heard behind me a
[58:39] great voice as a trumpet
[58:42] saying I'm Alpha and Amiga the first and
[58:45] the last one thou seeest writing a book
[58:48] and send it unto the seven churches
[58:50] which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna
[58:53] bergamus titira Saras Philadelphia and
[58:56] liada Sia now notice and I turned to see
[59:00] the voice that Spate with me and being
[59:04] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[59:09] now notice how John says first of all
[59:11] when he turned to look the first thing
[59:14] he saw when he heard the voice was
[59:17] something coming from Seven golden
[59:19] candlesticks now is that right
[59:22] all right we're going to stop there I
[59:24] want to read you this story of another
[59:26] way that God can speak before we get
[59:29] into this this way that God speaks all
[59:31] right
[59:32] brother man says a young man came to my
[59:34] house not long ago he said on the porch
[59:37] and I felt sorry for him an old beat up
[59:39] Chevy truck
[59:41] I want to talk to you and I said all
[59:43] right what is it and he said I come from
[59:45] Minneapolis he says and my wife went
[59:48] down to the church to the Pentecostal
[59:49] church and she got in the spirit now I
[59:53] just said the way he said it said she
[59:55] got in the spirit and said we did go
[59:57] once in a while to the Presbyterian
[59:59] church and he said she got in the spirit
[1:00:02] and she was very happy she come home and
[1:00:06] I and told me all about it and I wanted
[1:00:08] to go down there and get it he says now
[1:00:10] look honey you do whatever you want to
[1:00:13] and I'll work and make a living work and
[1:00:15] make a living but I'm not the religious
[1:00:17] type
[1:00:18] he said you go anywhere you want to
[1:00:20] it'll be all right Jesus well you ought
[1:00:23] to come down and get happy with us he
[1:00:25] said well we have a we have the greatest
[1:00:28] time and said she really was a changed
[1:00:30] person and said brother bam said that
[1:00:33] went on for about two years we quit
[1:00:36] playing cards and
[1:00:38] um I didn't go to any of the parties or
[1:00:40] and so forth like we didn't go to the
[1:00:42] parties like we used to said everything
[1:00:44] stopped and said I the church and I'd
[1:00:47] sit around and read the library book go
[1:00:49] down to the lodge or something and said
[1:00:51] one day I made a sale in in the car in
[1:00:53] my car lot he was a car salesman
[1:00:57] and I come in and I put my coat on and
[1:00:59] said it was summertime and said I put my
[1:01:05] cup there said on the road back said I'm
[1:01:07] up my coat he says and when I did I said
[1:01:10] I wonder if I gave him the keys and I
[1:01:12] reached down there in my pocket and if
[1:01:13] I'm not wrong but I'm talking about
[1:01:15] having like a little uh track or
[1:01:17] something somebody gave him
[1:01:19] and what I did I wondered if I had given
[1:01:22] him the keys I reached out in my pocket
[1:01:24] and pulled out a little piece of paper
[1:01:25] and it wrote on it where will you spend
[1:01:28] eternity
[1:01:29] said I just laid it down and turned the
[1:01:31] fans on and said and I picked it up
[1:01:33] again I couldn't get away from it where
[1:01:36] will you spend
[1:01:38] eternity
[1:01:39] and said I'm 40 years old I got to
[1:01:43] settle that thing said that's right said
[1:01:45] I just had to turn to work over to
[1:01:47] somebody else and I went home to seek
[1:01:49] God and I said I went to a famous
[1:01:51] Minister Mr Graham Billy Graham and said
[1:01:54] I went to his meeting said all he wants
[1:01:56] to all that wants to receive Christ
[1:01:58] stand up he said well I did he said
[1:02:00] accept Christ now as your personal
[1:02:02] Savior and it'll be settled said I'll I
[1:02:05] talked to some of the men there who told
[1:02:07] me that it's oh that's all I had to do
[1:02:09] well said I did the best I could said
[1:02:11] but I would it wasn't settled
[1:02:14] said I met up with the Nazarene people
[1:02:16] and said they're taking me back in the
[1:02:18] room and told me unless I got happy
[1:02:20] enough to shout that I wasn't Sanctified
[1:02:22] yet and so I stayed there and all of us
[1:02:24] prayed together until it sounded like
[1:02:26] one person praying said I'd get happy
[1:02:28] and shouted that they told me that's all
[1:02:30] over now I thought it was and then I
[1:02:33] went out but it was still not over
[1:02:36] I said I sold all my cars I was worth
[1:02:40] nearly half a million dollars I sold my
[1:02:42] car lot all my cars
[1:02:43] amen and said the only thing I got is
[1:02:46] just this old meter up car trying to
[1:02:47] give it to preachers and so forth where
[1:02:49] I can find
[1:02:53] trying to find where I can find peace to
[1:02:55] my soul he says I want to find the Lord
[1:02:57] he says and then I finally run into the
[1:02:58] Pentecostal people and they told me
[1:03:00] asked me if I ever spoke in tongues I
[1:03:02] told him no this is well you haven't got
[1:03:04] it unless you speak with tongues said
[1:03:06] they're taking it back and I prayed
[1:03:07] nearly half the night and got a little
[1:03:09] tent out there behind the Big Ten and
[1:03:11] said then I spoke in tongue and they
[1:03:12] said now you got it that's it brother I
[1:03:14] didn't have it
[1:03:15] and said went on down to Shreveport in
[1:03:17] Dallas the voice of healing said they
[1:03:18] had all the boys up there and said they
[1:03:20] tried to do me good but they couldn't do
[1:03:21] it and said and then they told me you as
[1:03:24] a prophet to come see you and you tell
[1:03:27] me surely and I crossed this and they
[1:03:30] said did you they tell me you cursed
[1:03:32] surely that you've crossed a separating
[1:03:33] line there's no hope for me if I had
[1:03:35] done all this and still didn't have it
[1:03:37] and I said well brother I want to tell
[1:03:39] you something I said no this is better
[1:03:40] than speaking I'm not a prophet that's
[1:03:43] what people say but said he says I'm
[1:03:45] just your servant but now you didn't
[1:03:47] need to go to apart from to straighten
[1:03:49] you out you just need the word of God
[1:03:51] and I says what uh Mr Grant told you
[1:03:54] it's the truth but the Nazarene people
[1:03:56] told you it's the truth about dependent
[1:03:57] people
[1:03:58] taught you the truth yet it's not but
[1:04:01] not all the truth to shout to raise up
[1:04:03] your hands speak with Thomas he be
[1:04:06] Christ receiving Christ is receiving the
[1:04:08] person of the Lord Jesus Christ then
[1:04:10] these other things take place after that
[1:04:12] see it's about the receiving Christ and
[1:04:15] you know personally see now you could do
[1:04:18] all that and still not have Christ yet
[1:04:21] he says well brother Brandon where can I
[1:04:23] find him I said I want to ask you
[1:04:26] something there's let's back go back to
[1:04:28] your story and he walked up and and he
[1:04:31] said well
[1:04:33] what do you mean God says you said that
[1:04:36] the day that when you come in you pick
[1:04:37] up a piece of paper something struck you
[1:04:40] and you said oh I want to see God
[1:04:43] I said uh up to that time you were going
[1:04:47] this way down this road and then you
[1:04:50] completely turned and you went this way
[1:04:52] he said what did that
[1:04:57] I said what changed your opinion what
[1:05:00] come into your heart
[1:05:04] that made you one time not care for God
[1:05:06] and so forth something that make you
[1:05:08] change to being loving God what done it
[1:05:12] he said well I don't know I said before
[1:05:14] that could be a creation there has to be
[1:05:16] a crate here to create that creation God
[1:05:18] came into your heart right there when
[1:05:20] you looked at that piece of paper he
[1:05:22] says you mean I've had it all along I
[1:05:24] said certainly brother
[1:05:37] you go to church I'm fine reading my
[1:05:40] library book and everything else all of
[1:05:42] a sudden stop stalking or will you spend
[1:05:44] eternity well most of it wouldn't have
[1:05:46] been
[1:05:47] for God I mean no man comes unto me
[1:05:49] except my father draw him first that was
[1:05:53] God draw him you can't hear the voice of
[1:05:55] God unless God opens up your ear to it
[1:05:58] and he opened up his ear he opened up
[1:06:00] his heart and God came right on in
[1:06:03] anybody been looking for some evidence
[1:06:05] some speaking in tongue shouting at this
[1:06:07] idea I mean that's all wonderful that's
[1:06:09] all fine but that's not receiving the
[1:06:12] person of Jesus Christ amen because your
[1:06:15] life has to Bear record of what you have
[1:06:17] gotten
[1:06:18] amen so yeah to think about it God can
[1:06:21] use your track he can use anything he
[1:06:24] wants to
[1:06:25] he's God
[1:06:27] you can be driving down the road
[1:06:29] oh can I just say this morning or this
[1:06:32] evening like Jesus said blessed are they
[1:06:34] which hunger and thirst after
[1:06:37] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:06:41] oh if you have a thirst in your heart
[1:06:43] you're a blessed person he couldn't have
[1:06:46] cared less he sold his car lot he sold
[1:06:48] all his business got a lot of men I'm so
[1:06:50] amazing I got to find a boy he was
[1:06:53] serious about me
[1:06:56] you know there's some things that God
[1:06:58] does for us for free
[1:07:00] for salvation I mean as the gift of
[1:07:02] Salvation is completely free just give
[1:07:04] it to you
[1:07:05] but there's other things that are not
[1:07:08] free
[1:07:12] amen be hard for us just
[1:07:15] thing what is it brother what are you
[1:07:17] talking about what's not free well your
[1:07:19] character is not free
[1:07:21] nope it's not a gift
[1:07:24] character is not a gift
[1:07:26] amen it's something that you have to
[1:07:29] suffer for
[1:07:30] for it amen praise the Lord you know and
[1:07:34] I was I was just thinking
[1:07:35] but anyway so let's go back here to uh
[1:07:37] back here now the revelations I want to
[1:07:40] say that I believe the foremost way for
[1:07:43] God to speak to us is through the
[1:07:47] fivefold ministry
[1:07:49] preaching
[1:07:50] by the foolishness of preaching God
[1:07:52] bestowed to save them that belief
[1:07:55] that's how God chose it isn't that right
[1:07:57] I mean I thought you know you might hear
[1:07:59] a voice you might you might be reading
[1:08:01] God can speak to us many different way
[1:08:03] he can but the primary way that he uses
[1:08:06] and that he can is through the preaching
[1:08:09] of the word and think about it how much
[1:08:11] time will spend there amen and then
[1:08:13] we'll come and maybe within an hour or
[1:08:14] so listening to preaching maybe twice
[1:08:16] two hours or something like that a week
[1:08:20] amen but God speaks through amen and the
[1:08:23] reason I went into this because notice
[1:08:24] how many notes Let me just read the rest
[1:08:26] of this and then we'll explain it
[1:08:28] scene Seven golden candlesticks
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:33] and in the midst of the Seven Candle six
[1:08:35] one like unto the son of man clothed
[1:08:38] with a garment down to the foot and a
[1:08:40] girt about the paps with a golden girdle
[1:08:42] brother Branham explained this as being
[1:08:45] girded like a judge amen is that right
[1:08:48] Church age spoke his head and his hair
[1:08:51] were white like wool that's why the snow
[1:08:54] his eyes were as a flame of fire his
[1:08:56] feet like unto fine brass if this as if
[1:09:00] they burned in the furnace and his voice
[1:09:02] was as the voice
[1:09:04] of many Waters
[1:09:07] right here's where I'd like to play that
[1:09:09] song the voice of many Waters amen what
[1:09:12] is this voice better man says it's the
[1:09:14] voice what are these many Waters many
[1:09:17] people
[1:09:18] what is God's voice where's God's voice
[1:09:20] in his seven Messengers in his Seven
[1:09:23] Stars in his ministers
[1:09:26] he said it's the voice of the ministers
[1:09:29] that's cried out to the people in every
[1:09:32] age standing there
[1:09:35] says you know that uh even a local body
[1:09:38] a pastor will be the judge for that
[1:09:40] community and so forth he said take
[1:09:44] because the prophet will meet this
[1:09:46] generation on Judgment Day
[1:09:48] amen
[1:09:50] that's right so think about that it's
[1:09:52] the voice of God that goes forth amen
[1:09:56] voice of many Waters and he had in his
[1:09:58] right hand Seven Stars and out of his
[1:10:01] mouth goes a sharp to edged sword his
[1:10:04] kindness was as the sun shining in his
[1:10:06] strength and when I saw him I fell at
[1:10:09] his feet as dead and laid him and he
[1:10:11] laid his right hand upon me and saying
[1:10:13] fear not I am the first and the last I'm
[1:10:15] he that liveth and was dead and behold I
[1:10:19] Am Alive forevermore amen I'm
[1:10:24] I know that's just one God
[1:10:27] he was alive he died on the calvary in
[1:10:30] his life forevermore and has the keys of
[1:10:33] hell and of death despite these things
[1:10:36] which thou see as seen and the things
[1:10:38] which are and the things which shall be
[1:10:40] hereafter
[1:10:41] The Mystery of the Seven Stars which
[1:10:45] thou saw us in my right hand and the
[1:10:48] Seven golden candlesticks
[1:10:50] all right the two the Seven Stars are
[1:10:53] the Angels of the seven churches and the
[1:10:57] Seven candlesticks all which thou saw us
[1:10:59] are the seven churches amens how many
[1:11:03] knows God has not just one mouth that he
[1:11:06] speaks anymore amen and when he was in
[1:11:09] Bible time but now he has many voices
[1:11:11] many mouthpieces those Seven Stars is
[1:11:14] who God was gonna use as his mouthpiece
[1:11:18] because if God's gonna say something you
[1:11:19] have to have somebody to speak it
[1:11:22] through
[1:11:25] amen that's why the foolishness of
[1:11:28] preaching what do we preach when we
[1:11:30] preach our own ideas no amen oh I wanted
[1:11:33] to preach on this sometime on how to how
[1:11:35] that if God is going to do anything he
[1:11:37] sends his word to do it I mean he
[1:11:40] believes he already gave us his word
[1:11:42] that's enough
[1:11:43] and what we preach we preach the word of
[1:11:47] God
[1:11:48] amen I believe the voice is still in the
[1:11:50] church even in Revelations the last
[1:11:52] chapter he says the spirit and the bride
[1:11:55] say come and him that is The Thirst come
[1:11:59] amen and drink of the Water of Life
[1:12:01] freely
[1:12:03] message and that resounding has to be
[1:12:06] sounded for two thousand years
[1:12:10] oh my he's still I mean did he still say
[1:12:13] come unto me all you who are weary and
[1:12:16] heavy laden did you ever wonder
[1:12:18] sometimes oh my how many times some of
[1:12:20] the a lot of y'all have testified
[1:12:22] brother Bob I'll tell you what I don't
[1:12:24] know oh I think sister sharing different
[1:12:26] ones he said man I sometimes think you
[1:12:28] were Brad amen that you got some kind of
[1:12:30] microphone hung up there because we'll
[1:12:32] have spoken of the same thing or had a
[1:12:33] question on that same thing and then you
[1:12:35] go to hitting on it you got to speak in
[1:12:38] that how many knows that's why we want
[1:12:39] to just be yielded to God say God use me
[1:12:42] help me to say something that'll trigger
[1:12:45] amen and bring a light to it lost sheep
[1:12:50] amen that's how it works God quickens
[1:12:54] who we will
[1:12:55] by the foolishness of preaching by those
[1:12:59] seven stops or seven candlesticks seven
[1:13:01] ages seven Church ages even now
[1:13:05] we've been taught by the prophet Malachi
[1:13:07] forward and the days of the voice of the
[1:13:09] silent Angel and then when he meets
[1:13:11] shall begin to solve the mystery of God
[1:13:13] should be finished as he is declared to
[1:13:15] his servants of prophet he says you know
[1:13:17] the in the bride the bride of Christ
[1:13:19] God's real church will be and have the
[1:13:23] final voice to the final age
[1:13:28] hey man how many believes you're the
[1:13:30] mouthpiece of God
[1:13:32] 's using your mouth he has no mouth but
[1:13:35] yours no heart but years no hands but
[1:13:36] years no feet but years but he's got
[1:13:38] plenty of them if we're yielded to him
[1:13:41] oh Hallelujah
[1:13:44] praise be to God aren't you glad for
[1:13:46] that
[1:13:47] to have that voice of God Amen
[1:13:51] Amen to speak to us through the ministry
[1:13:53] through the word basically just saying
[1:13:55] what God Said I mean it was that say
[1:13:57] what God said every time for God to love
[1:14:00] the world then whosoever then he gave
[1:14:02] his only begotten son then whosoever
[1:14:04] should believe him should not perish but
[1:14:06] have everlasting life
[1:14:07] he that Hearth my words and believe it
[1:14:09] on me shall have everlasting life shall
[1:14:12] not die or come into condemnation
[1:14:15] amen all that Christ said
[1:14:18] how blessed we are when you think about
[1:14:20] how blessed you are to be able to hear
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:25] I remember one time I remember so sorry
[1:14:28] brother Bannon being way up in the
[1:14:29] mountains and he was lost he was walking
[1:14:31] in circles and he was a God he told
[1:14:33] himself I can't get lost I'm a guide I
[1:14:35] know how to get it I know how the
[1:14:36] thickest part of the tree is going to be
[1:14:37] on the North side and so forth and amen
[1:14:39] but yet he found himself going in
[1:14:41] circles in a snowstorm
[1:14:43] huh and what happened he felt something
[1:14:47] touched his back hey man and make him
[1:14:49] turned around and look hey man I thought
[1:14:52] man if a person's lost in the world
[1:14:53] there's a master that's somebody that
[1:14:56] can touch you there's a voice that you
[1:14:58] can listen to a man that can guide you
[1:15:00] turn him around and amen he got into the
[1:15:02] lifeline showed him where the lifeline
[1:15:04] was that lead him right down there to
[1:15:06] his family back to his home
[1:15:09] I thought that's the way it is in this
[1:15:10] world with you and I if you're lost
[1:15:12] you're a sinner
[1:15:14] there's a Lifeline God has a way
[1:15:18] amen but you got to hear
[1:15:21] that voice
[1:15:23] the voice of God
[1:15:25] let's go with another one shall we
[1:15:27] amen
[1:15:29] praise the Lord
[1:15:35] it's found in uh
[1:15:37] First Kings let's go to First Kings
[1:15:44] First Kings
[1:15:47] thank you
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:59] First Kings the 19th Chapter let me see
[1:16:03] 19 and verse 9.
[1:16:06] 19 it will be going with verse 9. this
[1:16:10] was of course after
[1:16:11] Elijah killed all those false prophets
[1:16:14] and so forth in Jezebel threatened to
[1:16:17] kill him the next day and he was up and
[1:16:20] he was in the cave he found a cave to
[1:16:22] Lodge in and so forth and he came
[1:16:24] thinner into a cave and lodged there and
[1:16:27] behold the word of the Lord came to him
[1:16:28] and he said unto them here what here is
[1:16:30] thou Elijah and he said I have been very
[1:16:34] jealous for the Lord God of hosts for
[1:16:37] the children of Israel have forsaken thy
[1:16:39] Covenant Throne thine altars and slain
[1:16:42] thy prophets with the sword and I even I
[1:16:45] only am left and they seek my life to
[1:16:47] take it and he said go forth and stand
[1:16:50] upon the mount before the Lord and
[1:16:53] behold the Lord passed by and a great
[1:16:55] strong wind burned the mountains and
[1:16:59] breaking pieces the Rocks before the
[1:17:01] Lord
[1:17:04] and after the win an earthquake but the
[1:17:08] Lord was not in the earthquake and after
[1:17:11] the earthquake it fired but the Lord was
[1:17:14] not in the fire amen and after the fire
[1:17:20] a still small
[1:17:23] voice
[1:17:24] and it was so when Elijah heard it that
[1:17:27] he wrap his face in the Menthol and went
[1:17:28] out and stood at the entering end of the
[1:17:32] cave
[1:17:32] amen
[1:17:34] listen to what the prophet says we find
[1:17:36] that he went 40 days and nights and God
[1:17:38] located him stacked standing back there
[1:17:40] in a cave God wanted to attract his
[1:17:43] attention so he'd send a great storm by
[1:17:45] and it ripped the mountains it was so
[1:17:47] powerful till the Rocks rat and so forth
[1:17:49] but God wasn't in the storm
[1:17:52] and it went before God did And Then
[1:17:54] There came an earthquake shook the Earth
[1:17:56] and still God wasn't in the earthquake
[1:17:58] there came a fire but God wasn't in the
[1:18:00] fire and then there came a still Small
[1:18:02] Voice and God was in The Voice brothers
[1:18:05] and sisters I have haven't we been back
[1:18:07] in the cave long enough
[1:18:09] and you have to and to know that there's
[1:18:11] been a lot of earthquakes and shaking
[1:18:13] around a lot of noise
[1:18:17] amen
[1:18:19] a lot of noise
[1:18:20] he says but where's Ben Bob out of it
[1:18:23] all that's the reason I said this
[1:18:25] morning he said there's got to come
[1:18:27] something deeper than just the healing
[1:18:28] service there's got to come something
[1:18:30] deep for them just a gift of speaking in
[1:18:33] tongues
[1:18:34] there's got to be something deeper than
[1:18:36] just Mighty rushing winds and so forth
[1:18:38] he says God's this isn't even in it
[1:18:40] we've had rushing winds all over the
[1:18:43] country Sensations blood in the face and
[1:18:45] then
[1:18:46] the hands and all kinds of signs but
[1:18:49] where's God at
[1:18:51] woo
[1:18:52] I mean listen to this
[1:18:55] all the great fuss Americans guilty of
[1:18:57] listening to those noises oh we love
[1:18:59] noise
[1:19:01] but God's not in the noise
[1:19:05] amen how many knows that whenever you're
[1:19:07] preaching the gospel you have to bring a
[1:19:09] balance to things we know that wherever
[1:19:11] Jesus is there's always a lot of noise
[1:19:15] hey man
[1:19:17] but it isn't necessarily hello doesn't
[1:19:20] mean that you necessarily Christian
[1:19:22] because of it because I'll tell you what
[1:19:24] right now the Terrors they pray he's God
[1:19:27] just as much as though he does
[1:19:32] We Like it Loud
[1:19:36] huh
[1:19:39] get too quiet
[1:19:41] off to sleep
[1:19:44] right because that preachers man he
[1:19:46] can't hold my attention at all
[1:19:48] if I scream a little well I'll have your
[1:19:51] attention
[1:19:54] we're just prone that way we like the
[1:19:56] fire we like the smoke
[1:19:58] I thought about concerts Brother Brad
[1:20:00] concert back Eastwood man look at the
[1:20:01] concerts used to be they have what big
[1:20:03] old fireballs going up bunch of smoke
[1:20:05] billowing everywhere and you know they
[1:20:07] got all kinds of what is it nowadays
[1:20:09] they have these uh fireworks everywhere
[1:20:15] any of that that is in simplicity
[1:20:20] I wondered why the prophet of God would
[1:20:22] have to go back into a cave
[1:20:24] all the way back into arcade for a day
[1:20:27] or two and seeking God's answer they're
[1:20:29] saying that these are demons and not a
[1:20:31] God these visions that I'm having
[1:20:33] everything I want to have an answer I'm
[1:20:34] going to go back there and I'm gonna die
[1:20:36] if I don't get an answer I'm gonna go
[1:20:37] back there and have to trade show three
[1:20:39] o'clock in the morning brother John he
[1:20:41] said finally he's in the seen a little
[1:20:43] flickering in the light coming into the
[1:20:45] cave
[1:20:46] huh
[1:20:48] let me tell you something sometimes God
[1:20:51] allows us you know like I said God gives
[1:20:53] us freely the gift of Salvation is free
[1:20:56] but other things God allows you to get
[1:20:58] into desperation because how many knows
[1:21:00] God loves sometimes to put us into
[1:21:02] desperation he loves perseverance
[1:21:07] he loves to see perseverance how do we
[1:21:10] know I'll tell you how we know because
[1:21:12] that woman that wants himself wanted
[1:21:13] something from the Lord Jesus amen he's
[1:21:15] not my needs not me to give the
[1:21:17] children's bread to Gentile dog
[1:21:20] didn't even talk to it for a while kept
[1:21:22] walking on can you imagine him walking
[1:21:24] automatic you just ignore her
[1:21:27] nobody did come on people
[1:21:29] and then after a while finally he said
[1:21:31] you know he said he makes that same he
[1:21:33] says yes yes Pastor that's the truth but
[1:21:36] don't even the dogs eat the crumbs that
[1:21:38] fall from the master table he realized
[1:21:41] that she had the kind of persevere and
[1:21:42] she wasn't going to quit because he
[1:21:44] walked away from her
[1:21:45] he well she wasn't gonna quit because he
[1:21:48] called her a dog
[1:21:50] no she was gonna get in God's love stuff
[1:21:53] if God did all that for us he's looking
[1:21:55] for something from us
[1:21:57] he's seeing what we were all my every
[1:22:00] little thing that you do oh I wouldn't
[1:22:02] have to do it but why don't you do it
[1:22:03] anyway if it's where the Lord got a lot
[1:22:06] he sees what you do
[1:22:09] oh my for without faith it's impossible
[1:22:12] to please him if it's impossible to
[1:22:14] please for today to come to God must
[1:22:15] believe that he is and that he is a
[1:22:18] rewarder of them that haphazardly seek
[1:22:20] him no diligently seek him God loves to
[1:22:24] see diligence out of us
[1:22:26] sometimes we need a day or two we need
[1:22:28] more time we need to seek the Lord I
[1:22:30] believe that we we don't see Visions we
[1:22:33] know
[1:22:33] we'll see dreams we don't see the things
[1:22:35] we do and then we don't try hard enough
[1:22:37] we don't spend enough time saying God I
[1:22:39] want this more than anything because
[1:22:40] I'll tell you when the prophet went back
[1:22:42] there he said Sunday I got 23 dollars in
[1:22:44] the bank I'm going down if I don't come
[1:22:47] back I'm dead cause I'm going there to
[1:22:49] die unless God talk to me
[1:22:51] that's what he said I got it right there
[1:22:54] huh
[1:22:55] you get into that kind of desperation
[1:22:56] you get God's attention
[1:22:58] sometimes it takes desperation God puts
[1:23:01] you in desperation God put you in
[1:23:02] Desperate places sometimes before you
[1:23:04] really call upon him saying God I need
[1:23:06] to hear from you
[1:23:08] yeah
[1:23:11] amen that's the truth anyhow
[1:23:14] he allows to get to those places oh my
[1:23:17] how many knows I meant even even uh
[1:23:19] remember when the disciples and then he
[1:23:22] was the three disciples on the way to
[1:23:24] Emmaus when they came and they talked to
[1:23:26] him amen and when they come to hit their
[1:23:28] house he made us he was going to go on
[1:23:30] by he was gonna keep going
[1:23:34] but they beat him come and stay he was
[1:23:36] waiting for an invitation just like when
[1:23:40] he said I stand at the door and knock If
[1:23:43] any man will open you've got to open
[1:23:45] from your side
[1:23:47] yeah
[1:23:49] amen got to open it up from your side
[1:23:54] all he can do is now
[1:23:56] and if you're a sheep
[1:23:58] you'll haste into that door and you'll
[1:24:00] open that door
[1:24:02] amen
[1:24:04] my
[1:24:05] praise me to God
[1:24:07] to hear the voice of God
[1:24:10] amen now notice
[1:24:12] America is guilting of listening too
[1:24:14] much noise we love noise
[1:24:16] but God
[1:24:18] although as honorable the things that
[1:24:21] they are yet God isn't in noise
[1:24:26] if that had been so when the Africans
[1:24:29] when they beat them tomtoms you ain't
[1:24:31] never heard such noises Rhythm and such
[1:24:33] dancing in the spirit have you huh God
[1:24:37] wasn't in it and we've had Mighty
[1:24:39] rushing Mighty winds and we've had all
[1:24:41] kinds of fires earthquakes
[1:24:44] shakings and great revivals and things
[1:24:47] like that and God wasn't in it if it
[1:24:49] hadn't been it would have showed itself
[1:24:50] so
[1:24:52] but after that come a still small voice
[1:24:56] amen preacher might yell so loud it
[1:25:00] doesn't mix the windows rattle but
[1:25:04] you'll still hear it in that still small
[1:25:07] voice
[1:25:08] something will say that's for me
[1:25:11] the Lord himself has to Quicken that
[1:25:14] word to you or you won't get a thing
[1:25:19] you'll walk out those doors just the
[1:25:21] same or worse
[1:25:23] as you came in unless God speaks to your
[1:25:28] heart
[1:25:31] amen
[1:25:33] I'll tell you right now
[1:25:35] oh my
[1:25:38] let me see if I have something here
[1:25:43] God is able this minute to
[1:25:45] Discovery cancer out of this building
[1:25:47] open up every blind and eye to set
[1:25:50] everybody in freedom and liberty God has
[1:25:54] provided away he's made a way he sent
[1:25:57] his son Jesus Christ the holy spirit is
[1:26:00] brooding over us today
[1:26:03] the Holy Ghost is all over us it's
[1:26:07] blessing us it's bringing an atmosphere
[1:26:10] Hallelujah
[1:26:12] oh my I might as well change my subject
[1:26:15] here a little bit we talk about amen
[1:26:17] from the foundation of the world when
[1:26:19] the Earth was with dark and it was with
[1:26:21] my form it was without it was void and
[1:26:24] there was Darkness upon the face of
[1:26:26] those all of the place and then it
[1:26:28] wasn't until the warmth of the sunshine
[1:26:30] amen the Holy Spirit as the prophet of
[1:26:33] God said begin to brood over the Earth
[1:26:35] and he brought flowers he brought trees
[1:26:38] he bought Greenery he brought cattle he
[1:26:41] brought out of me but everything by his
[1:26:43] brooding and by his calling
[1:26:46] hey man
[1:26:48] amen
[1:26:51] sure he did
[1:26:52] you love the Lord
[1:26:55] my
[1:26:58] can I finish that
[1:27:01] that's right it was the holy spirit's

[1:37:13] God's promised that it is his provided
[1:37:16] way
[1:37:17] oh man we've had all kinds of voices
[1:37:19] like I said Baptist method all kinds of
[1:37:21] denominational voices out there but he
[1:37:23] said you know that it's going to be in
[1:37:24] the evening time it shall be light and
[1:37:27] then we had like so to speak in a
[1:37:29] chicken yard Amen in all kinds but every
[1:37:32] time the eagle screamed he had some kind
[1:37:34] of a scream amen all that I no doubt
[1:37:37] this just comes to my mind first now but
[1:37:39] no doubt that every time an ego was
[1:37:40] scream amen trying to make a noise no
[1:37:43] doubt but them chickens would shut up it
[1:37:45] would probably have scare them
[1:37:47] no that sounds like a predator to me
[1:37:51] that sounds like something that would
[1:37:53] eat me they all shut up amen
[1:37:55] and that eagle fell out of place
[1:37:57] out of place kept screaming out of place
[1:38:00] out of place I just wasn't in place of

[1:39:32] glory

[1:40:38] written mystery Babylon
[1:40:40] the great the mother of harlems and
[1:40:44] Abominations of the Earth
[1:40:46] how many knows the Catholics are the
[1:40:48] mother Harlot they say they're the
[1:40:50] mother Church all for the Antichrist
[1:40:53] they are the mother Church
[1:40:55] but she had a lot of little harness and
[1:40:58] now her little harlots are allowing
[1:41:01] homosexuals preachers
[1:41:04] Pentecostal churches which is next to
[1:41:07] the message right next to us and then
[1:41:09] have women preachers
[1:41:12] lie everything else in the book to go on
[1:41:14] there in abomination
[1:41:17] and Abominations of the Earth
[1:41:19] but notice this Mighty Angel cried
[1:41:21] Babylon the great is Fallen it's fallen
[1:41:24] and has become the habitation of devils
[1:41:26] that's exactly what's happened in the
[1:41:28] prophecy 53 Pentecost Baptist Methodist
[1:41:31] Pentecostal all of them they're all dead
[1:41:34] [Applause]
[1:41:35] that's what he said that was a prophet
[1:41:37] of God God's voice
[1:41:40] you know a lot of times he discern the
[1:41:42] thoughts and intense of the heart and he
[1:41:43] says I got to go back and play that tape
[1:41:44] back I don't know what I said he uses my
[1:41:46] voice
[1:41:48] Jesus Christ was so
[1:41:50] real in his church until he could speak
[1:41:53] to a man use his voice and he'd not even
[1:41:55] realize what he's saying
[1:42:00] oh my brother bam says you know I've
[1:42:02] preached the gospel he says now if Jesus
[1:42:05] Christ will come and vindicate and prove
[1:42:07] it and after he would come and he would
[1:42:09] prove it he says he says now it's sin
[1:42:12] for you to unbelieve
[1:42:15] after God vindicates now it's sin
[1:42:18] for you to unbelieve
[1:42:20] disbelief
[1:42:22] how many believe it that voice
[1:42:26] meet everybody in this laodicea age on
[1:42:29] the Judgment Day
[1:42:30] can I say something we're going to play
[1:42:31] some tapes over there if you don't like
[1:42:32] tapes now they don't like tape now
[1:42:33] they're gonna get played some tapes
[1:42:37] one amen
[1:42:38] come on folks you know that's what he
[1:42:40] said he said this message will meet this
[1:42:41] generation on Judgment Day
[1:42:43] because it wasn't this man's doing it
[1:42:46] was the pillar of fire above his head
[1:42:48] that was doing it
[1:42:50] it was God that was doing it and he used
[1:42:53] the prophet's voice just like he uses
[1:42:55] any god-given Minister's voice
[1:42:59] do with it what you want
[1:43:04] amen a prophet with a Kentucky language
[1:43:07] is with fetches and totes and Carries
[1:43:09] and all kinds of Kentucky language
[1:43:13] not elegant and all of that God you know
[1:43:16] I was thinking on the way to church how
[1:43:17] we say that God hides himself in
[1:43:18] Simplicity well but Austin whenever I go
[1:43:21] hunting we hide in the woods don't we we
[1:43:23] try to hide what do we camouflage
[1:43:25] ourselves we try to wear camouflage the
[1:43:28] stupidest thing I ever heard inside here
[1:43:30] you know we God camouflage ourselves for
[1:43:32] the time and we've got manual put on
[1:43:34] these masks I know you do it put on all
[1:43:36] of that other stuff and then we teach
[1:43:38] that he's colorblind he can't tell the
[1:43:41] fun from another
[1:43:45] I could go when this here and do justice
[1:43:48] good probably
[1:43:51] I know I could but again because I've
[1:43:53] done it
[1:43:54] the only one important thing is make
[1:43:56] sure you're in the right the wind is in
[1:43:58] the right direction because they you
[1:44:00] ain't gonna deceive that on them
[1:44:02] they might you might be high enough they
[1:44:04] don't see you but they're gonna smell
[1:44:05] you if you ain't careful
[1:44:07] oh my but what does God do God hides
[1:44:10] himself in humility and simplicity
[1:44:14] amen
[1:44:17] in a bunch of nuts
[1:44:20] a bunch of crazy people following a
[1:44:22] prophet of God claiming God sent us a
[1:44:23] prophet
[1:44:24] I am not ashamed of it
[1:44:27] he said he would he said he had seven
