[6:59] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[7:01] season
[7:02] his leaf also shall not wither and
[7:05] whatsoever he doeth

[7:16] the judgment

[32:23] a lot of times he'll be like his
[32:25] devotional that he read but he's
[32:27] sent me something yesterday i really
[32:28] liked i says by the time i want you to
[32:30] come up and read that to the church this
[32:32] morning so
[32:33] amen we're going to have a little
[32:34] devotions this morning it'll be all
[32:35] right
[32:36] better time in richmond god bless you
[32:39] amen appreciate brother tommy what god
[32:41] has done in his life
[32:42] amen just relax
[32:48] i thought him i could get up here and do
[32:49] it if i could just uh
[32:52] maybe not do like i did in my last
[32:53] speech at a best man uh
[32:57] speech i put the paper in my pocket
[32:59] started winging it messed it all up so
[33:02] i'm just gonna try to read this for
[33:03] y'all
[33:05] uh here on the devotional yesterday it
[33:07] said that
[33:09] there's no other gods was the title of
[33:11] it in exodus 2 3
[33:13] thou shalt have no other gods before me
[33:17] excuse me the most recent polls said is
[33:21] that the top five religions of the world
[33:23] are christianity
[33:24] islam hinduism buddhism and agnostic
[33:27] but there is one major difference
[33:29] between all of those other religions and
[33:31] christianity
[33:32] that is that christianity is the only
[33:34] religion that speaks of redemption in a
[33:36] non-work
[33:38] works-based method the christian faith
[33:41] and belief in the lord jesus christ
[33:42] is the one true god this non it's not a
[33:46] work
[33:46] based religion we know that it is our
[33:49] faith the free gift of
[33:50] which is given by grace that we are
[33:53] saved through
[33:54] islam believes in one god but bases it
[33:58] off a faith off of works hinduism has so
[34:02] many gods that you can choose your own
[34:04] god
[34:04] buddhism perhaps the most dangerous
[34:06] doesn't believe in a god
[34:08] and all but believes you can get by
[34:11] without god
[34:11] as long as you bring yourself to nirvana
[34:14] agnostic is neither
[34:16] the belief in god or the disbelief in
[34:18] god
[34:19] but a state of apathy and some
[34:23] about god all these religions have
[34:25] formalism passed to get you to
[34:27] some eventual meaningful end but none
[34:31] can provide the grace of almighty being
[34:34] bestowing salvation to a group of people
[34:36] completely undeserving
[34:38] in fact the christian faith is the
[34:40] redemption of those who threw the free
[34:42] gift of sinless living back into the
[34:44] face of god
[34:45] this is why the scripture says god is
[34:47] love
[34:49] and all the religions are dead and offer
[34:52] a dying humanity
[34:53] only temporal relief and distracting
[34:55] from their ultimate end
[34:57] the wages of sin being disbelief is
[35:00] death
[35:00] but god in his mercy gave us the shed
[35:03] blood of jesus christ to purchase our
[35:05] salvation
[35:06] by his stripes and we are healed god is
[35:09] a jealous
[35:10] god and wants nothing and no one ahead
[35:13] of him and his place in our hearts
[35:15] are you just following a religion or do
[35:17] you personally have a relationship with
[35:19] the lord jesus christ
[35:20] are you following or practicing or do
[35:22] you really know the love of the living
[35:24] god
[35:25] our god is the only one that came out of
[35:28] his grave and is alive and living
[35:30] among us today and brother branham said
[35:32] take
[35:33] and take on the whole armor of god
[35:36] all other religions are dead their forms
[35:39] are dead
[35:40] there's only one that's right that's
[35:42] christianity
[35:43] because christ is living in the church
[35:45] of christ amen
[35:47] making his word manifest and this he is
[35:50] the same
[35:51] it is the same word it'll do the same
[35:53] thing and show the same works
[35:55] and the signs of matthew 28 says so
[35:58] and by be be with me his army
[36:02] in them securing them think of it the
[36:04] great word
[36:06] general triumphing in us you know that's
[36:08] just awesome man
[36:09] because you know god is love it means a
[36:11] lot to me because i remember after i'd
[36:13] got
[36:14] born again and had a personal experience
[36:16] and accepting the law
[36:18] towards my lord and savior i called
[36:20] myself one day i made this cross and uh
[36:22] i wrote on it god is love and later on i
[36:24] look back and i thought to myself you
[36:25] know where'd that come from
[36:27] and you know i knew there was something
[36:28] in me you know and
[36:30] you know there's something in me that
[36:31] wants to share more of god and
[36:33] i'm not very good at getting up here
[36:35] doing things like this but you know
[36:37] god is an awesome god and you know i was
[36:39] just
[36:40] me and troy and mike and joe and a bunch
[36:42] of us started to
[36:43] start this little bible study over here
[36:45] just a little testimony and i thought
[36:47] we're trying to you know share the
[36:49] message a little bit because
[36:51] you know i've tried to share it a little
[36:52] bit with people and you know
[36:54] i've been told i'm a holy roller uh i
[36:56] follow a cold
[36:58] i've had the books gave back to me from
[36:59] family and stuff that said you know i
[37:01] wouldn't
[37:01] i wouldn't uh read these for the last
[37:03] books on on earth you know but
[37:05] you know them books that are gave back
[37:07] to me now i'm going to share them with
[37:08] somebody else and that day
[37:10] was coming up to the first bible study
[37:12] uh i was really nervous and
[37:15] uh you know how the devil is by the end
[37:16] of that day i better
[37:18] call it off but i got this in the mail
[37:20] that day and it was only thing
[37:23] in envelope there well had a stamp too
[37:25] but it said
[37:26] my sheep shall know my voice you know
[37:28] that was just confirmation to me that
[37:29] you know if they're meant to hear it
[37:30] they're gonna hear it but at the end of
[37:32] the day
[37:33] we're just blessed people by god's grace
[37:35] to believe the message of the hour
[37:37] and has praise god
[37:50] praise the lord amen god is good isn't
[37:53] he
[37:55] amen sister hannah are you going to give
[37:57] us a testimony this morning aren't you
[37:59] amen i told donna that i wanted to give
[38:02] you
[38:03] the mic so that she could turn the
[38:04] camera so that people on the internet
[38:06] could hear it too all right right would
[38:09] that be okay
[38:11] come on brother joe bring the mic up
[38:12] there with you
[38:14] all right yeah i'll bring it down
[38:20] amen and sister hannah i believe it's
[38:22] just a prime example of what the lord
[38:23] has done and
[38:24] can do sister hannah
[38:27] so when i become a nurse i was i
[38:30] actually wanted a job in the hospital
[38:32] but
[38:33] whenever i worked my i done my
[38:36] precepting in the hospital
[38:37] i would have to miss church every other
[38:40] week
[38:41] for the weekend shift because it's
[38:43] mandatory that you do it and so
[38:46] i said well i would i never got through
[38:48] nursing school had it not been for god
[38:50] so i sure ain't gonna miss church every
[38:51] other weekend so i chose to take the
[38:53] nursing home route which
[38:55] i've had a job for a long time monday
[38:57] through friday and it's worked really
[38:58] well and i rarely ever have to miss
[39:00] church but
[39:02] the on-call um where i'm at is
[39:05] ridiculous
[39:06] and so just to give you an idea i have a
[39:10] i'll call every tuesday and then so
[39:13] that's four days out of a month
[39:14] and then also a friday saturday and
[39:17] sunday a month so seven days a month
[39:19] which might not sound a lot to y'all
[39:21] but i'm on call 24 hours a day so i go
[39:24] in and work my regular shift
[39:26] sometimes i might have to work 3-11 i've
[39:28] had it
[39:29] lately where before i ever get home and
[39:31] get my car turned off they've called me
[39:33] and told me to come back
[39:34] um so even if you work your day shift
[39:37] hours then you also
[39:39] have to go back if they need you to work
[39:41] 11 to 7 which is really hard on your
[39:43] body
[39:45] so this summer i worked 37 out of 44
[39:50] days
[39:50] night shift 12-hour shifts and it really
[39:53] took a toll on me
[39:54] and so i just been praying that the lord
[39:57] would
[39:58] give me a job where i didn't have to
[39:59] miss church i've had
[40:01] a few interviews lately and i actually
[40:03] went back to the hospital
[40:04] it was the exact same thing again that
[40:06] i'd have to miss church every other
[40:08] weekend
[40:09] i just said i'm not going to do it you
[40:10] know that cannot be god's perfect will
[40:12] for me
[40:13] and so i had applied for a position a
[40:15] year ago where i could work from home it
[40:17] would be monday through friday
[40:19] no on call no holidays uh
[40:22] nothing and make about the same that i
[40:24] make now and for some reason the lord
[40:26] just shut the door
[40:27] in my face and i just could not believe
[40:30] it honestly but i just told him you know
[40:32] i know you know what's per your perfect
[40:34] will for me
[40:36] so at that time it just was not god's
[40:38] perfect will
[40:40] so this time i applied again and um
[40:43] me and joyce actually applied together
[40:45] and i a girl that's in the message she's
[40:48] goes to brother joseph hammond's church
[40:50] her name is amber golden
[40:52] she actually works for the company that
[40:53] we're going to work for
[40:55] and i told her i said if y'all only have
[40:58] one position open i would rather just
[41:00] get it because
[41:00] she's under she's the director of
[41:02] nursing so she's under a lot more stress
[41:04] than i am
[41:05] she's actually on call 24 hours a day
[41:07] seven days a week
[41:09] 365 days a year so
[41:12] um she has a lot of those days where she
[41:15] has to go back in and work night shift
[41:16] which is
[41:17] not right but anyway so i told the girl
[41:20] i said if there's only one position i
[41:22] would rather joe us get it
[41:24] and she did get it that's her story to
[41:27] tell though
[41:28] but um so i just joe was just like man
[41:32] you sure have your heart set on staying
[41:34] at home and
[41:35] he just did not he was just really
[41:37] questioning if that was the right thing
[41:39] for me and
[41:40] i just kept telling the lord i just
[41:42] don't see how it could not be your
[41:43] perfect willing way for a christian
[41:45] woman to be able to work from home if
[41:46] given the opportunity
[41:49] so um me and joyce have an office at
[41:53] work and there's just a bathroom
[41:54] that divides our office and one day we
[41:57] was just sitting there i was working
[41:59] away and she started
[42:00] screaming in her office hannah come here
[42:02] so i ran over i thought something was
[42:04] wrong
[42:04] she was like they have posted this job
[42:06] again you better get on here and apply
[42:08] for it so
[42:09] i ran back over to my office and i was
[42:11] applying for it and
[42:12] so i got the job and i'm very thankful
[42:15] that i start november the 23rd
[42:17] and we had to give a 30-day notice so
[42:20] our
[42:21] we will be done and uh no on call thank
[42:24] the lord
[42:28] so
[42:43] amen stand with me if you will
[43:07] all right praise the lord
[43:12] amen let's approach the author
[43:16] of our heads

[44:30] you
[44:31] and ask god if there's any ways in this
[44:33] lord that is unlike you and that you're

[45:42] lord we want to thank you for each one
[45:43] in here lord that loves you and
[45:46] that loves to come to your house to
[45:47] worship you in spirit and in truth lord

[45:50] that is seeking to escape lord jesus
[45:52] this wicked age that we're living in
[45:54] and to get away from it and to be drawn
[45:56] unto the father
[45:58] and we just ask your blessing now in
[45:59] jesus christ's name
[46:01] amen and amen amen
[46:04] praise the lord this morning amen
[46:16] amen if you will let's turn our bibles
[46:19] this morning to
[46:20] [Music]
[46:22] saint john 21
[46:26] saint john 21
[46:32] and i don't know we'll just follow the
[46:35] leading of the spirit
[46:37] this morning if that's okay on the
[46:39] length of our service
[46:40] and then we usually have a pretty much
[46:43] uh routine on our time but
[46:47] i don't know which way it'll go amen it
[46:49] might be shorter than i think
[46:50] maybe longer we don't know but we just
[46:52] want to give the lord all the time that
[46:54] he needs would that be okay
[46:56] so we're going to give the lord time to
[46:57] speak to our hearts this morning
[46:59] amen i was praying yesterday
[47:04] and i'll just tell you how i got this
[47:05] come to this message
[47:07] and i was praying yesterday lord
[47:11] last night it was actually i'm just
[47:14] meditating on you
[47:15] on the lord and and saying you know i
[47:18] desire lord jesus that you'd help me
[47:21] or jesus that i might feed the sheep
[47:24] amen
[47:25] that i might have something to give to
[47:26] the people amen that would edify them
[47:28] and be a blessing you know
[47:30] and i got to thinking you know i know
[47:32] that the lord cares
[47:33] about feeding the sheep you know and
[47:36] then the scripture came to me and this
[47:38] is the scripture we're going to
[47:39] start off with i guess uh it came to me
[47:43] uh where he said to peter you know
[47:47] peter loveth down me and feed my sheep
[47:50] amen
[47:52] and from there i just began to
[47:55] more and more the lord began to kind of
[47:57] lay on my heart to speak so i just feel
[47:59] like
[48:01] this morning's message is going to be
[48:02] titled feeding my sheep amen
[48:06] feeding the sheep would that be okay all
[48:08] right so saint john 21
[48:32] um
[48:34] and we'll begin with 1-17
[48:38] after these things jesus showed himself
[48:39] again to the disciples
[48:42] at the sea of tiberias and on this wise
[48:45] showed he
[48:46] himself there there they were gathered
[48:50] together there were together simon peter
[48:53] thomas called idiomus and nathanael
[48:56] and canaan in galilee and the sons of
[49:00] zebedee and two other of his disciples
[49:03] simon peter sayeth unto him i go fishing
[49:08] and they said unto him we also go with
[49:10] thee
[49:11] they went forth and entered into a ship
[49:14] immediately and
[49:15] that night they caught nothing but when
[49:18] the morning was now come jesus stood by
[49:20] the shore but the disciples knew not
[49:22] that it was jesus
[49:23] then said jesus unto them children have
[49:26] ye any meat
[49:27] they answered him no and he said unto
[49:30] them cast the net on the other side of
[49:32] the ship
[49:32] and ye shall find they cast therefore
[49:36] and now they were not able to draw it
[49:38] for the multitude of fishes
[49:40] therefore that disciple whom jesus loved
[49:42] said unto peter
[49:44] it is the lord now when simon peter
[49:47] heard that it was the lord he gird his
[49:49] fisherman scored on to him
[49:51] for he was naked and he did cast himself
[49:53] into the sea
[49:54] and the other disciples came it came in
[49:56] a little ship for they were far from the
[49:58] land
[49:59] but as it were 200 cubits dragging the
[50:02] net with fishes
[50:04] as soon as as soon then
[50:07] as they were come to land they saw a
[50:09] fire of coals
[50:11] there and fish laid there on and bread
[50:14] and jesus said unto them bring
[50:16] of the fish which ye have now caught
[50:19] simon peter went up and drew the net to
[50:22] land
[50:22] full of great fishes 153.
[50:26] and for all there were so many yet was
[50:29] the net not broken
[50:30] jesus saith unto them come and dine
[50:35] and none of the disciples thirst ask him
[50:37] who art thou
[50:38] knowing that it was the lord jesus then
[50:40] cometh and taketh bread and giveth them
[50:43] and fish likewise now
[50:46] this is now the third time that jesus
[50:48] showed himself to his disciples
[50:50] after that he was risen from the dead
[50:53] so when he had dined when they had dined
[50:56] jesus said unto simon peter simon son of
[50:58] jonas
[50:59] love this thou me more than these and he
[51:02] saith unto him ye lord thou knowest
[51:04] that i love thee and he saith unto him
[51:07] feed
[51:08] my lambs he saith to him again
[51:12] the second time simon son of jonas
[51:15] loveth thou me
[51:16] he says unto him lord yea lord thou
[51:18] knowest that i love thee
[51:20] he saith unto him feed my
[51:23] sheep he saith unto him the third time
[51:27] simon son of jonas love this thou me
[51:30] peter was grieved because he said unto
[51:31] him the third time
[51:32] loveth thou me and he said unto him lord
[51:35] thou knowest all
[51:36] things thou knowest that i love thee
[51:38] jesus saith unto him
[51:39] feed my sheep amen may god add his
[51:42] blessings to his reading of the words
[51:44] you can be seated
[51:46] amen just the reading of this scripture
[51:49] tells us that jesus
[51:51] amen cares about whether we get fed
[51:54] or not amen how many believe that the
[51:58] lord jesus
[51:59] and i was just thinking you know if i as
[52:01] a pastor as a shepherd
[52:02] a minor shepherd amen would care about
[52:05] the feeding of the sheep
[52:07] how much more would jesus care about
[52:10] if you get something to eat or not amen
[52:13] how many knows the lord cares about
[52:14] whether you get
[52:15] food or whether you don't he cares that
[52:18] we are
[52:18] fed amen amen
[52:22] praise the lord so we want to begin here
[52:25] and just begin to think about
[52:26] how that the lord wants us amen healthy
[52:29] i mean just as a
[52:31] mother or a father would do anything to
[52:33] make sure that his
[52:35] children have the proper nutrition
[52:38] because i believe in this hour that it's
[52:40] time for us to be fed right
[52:42] amen amen now i want to
[52:46] perhaps if i could you know over in
[52:49] matthew
[52:50] 24 but before we go to matthew 24 i want
[52:54] to go to
[52:55] revelation actually the first one is in
[52:57] ezekiel all right let's go to ezekiel
[53:03] the third chapter ezekiel 3.
[53:25] now ezekiel 1 ezekiel 1 is the one i
[53:28] wanted
[53:36] let's begin with
[53:44] verse 4 of chapter 1 and i looked and
[53:47] behold a whirlwind came out of the north
[53:50] a great cloud and a fire
[53:51] enfolding itself and the brightness was
[53:54] about it
[53:55] and out of the midst thereof as the
[53:57] color of amber
[53:59] out of the midst of the fire also out of
[54:01] the midst of thereof came the likeness
[54:03] of four
[54:05] living creatures and this was their
[54:08] appearance
[54:09] they had the likeness of a man and every
[54:12] one of
[54:13] everyone had four faces and every one
[54:15] had
[54:16] four wings amen and the
[54:19] and their feet were straight feet and
[54:21] the soul of their feet was like unto the
[54:23] soul of a calf's foot
[54:25] and they spring they sparkled like the
[54:27] cold the color
[54:28] of burnished brass and they had hands of
[54:32] a man
[54:33] under their wings and on their four
[54:35] sides
[54:36] and they forehead their faces and their
[54:39] wings
[54:40] and their wings were joined one to
[54:43] another and they turned not when they
[54:45] went
[54:45] and they went everyone straight forward
[54:48] now this is verse 10 is what i want to
[54:50] get to
[54:50] and then i want to go over the book of
[54:52] revelations and find out these
[54:54] same four living creatures spoke of all
[54:58] the way over in revelations
[55:00] amen revelations 5 i believe it is
[55:06] yes revelations 5 verse 10 and
[55:09] for as the likeness of their faces they
[55:13] had
[55:14] the face of a man the face of a lion
[55:18] on the right side and they forehead the
[55:21] face
[55:22] of an ox on the left side and therefore
[55:25] also the face of an eagle
[55:29] amen so the face of a man the face of a
[55:33] lion the face of an ox
[55:35] now this is not quite written in the
[55:38] same
[55:39] order in revelations as what this is
[55:41] here
[55:45] or is it yes it is okay
[55:48] the first one had the face of a man no
[55:50] the face of the man in revelations i
[55:52] believe was
[55:53] second or third he was first the lion so
[55:56] let's go see if that's that way
[56:00] revelations
[56:18] revelations hold on a second
[56:23] i've got room five seven so let's work
[56:25] to see where that takes us
[56:27] yeah that's right revelations 5 7 is
[56:29] correct
[56:31] let's go to start with verse 5. and out
[56:33] of the throne
[56:35] all right proceeded lightnings and
[56:37] thunders and voices
[56:40] and there were seven lamps of fire
[56:42] burning before the throne which are the
[56:44] seven spirits of god
[56:45] and before their throne there was a sea
[56:47] of glass like unto crystal and in the
[56:49] midst of the throne and round about the
[56:51] throne
[56:52] were four beasts full of eyes
[56:56] before and behind amen
[57:00] and and the first piece was like unto a
[57:03] lion
[57:04] okay over on the other one i believe it
[57:06] was second here it's the first
[57:08] was like unto a lion the second beast
[57:10] like unto a calf
[57:12] the third beast like unto the face of a
[57:14] man and the fourth
[57:16] beast was like unto a flying eagle
[57:19] amen so we know through the prophet of
[57:23] god that these four
[57:24] beasts were powers that god used amen
[57:27] through the
[57:28] seven church ages since the time of
[57:30] christ that it represented the four
[57:33] beasts
[57:33] amen or the four peace powers amen that
[57:37] god anointed
[57:38] his church with the first one started
[57:40] with paul irenaeus and martin down
[57:42] through there
[57:43] it was the lion age amen the lion of the
[57:46] tribe of judah which of course
[57:47] represented jesus christ
[57:49] amen we was a lion age and then from the
[57:52] second one was an
[57:53] ox age which represents uh labor
[57:56] amen labor and sacrifice it remember
[57:59] those two things
[58:00] labor and sacrifice is what the uh
[58:03] our our brothers and sisters did
[58:06] during the dark ages amen of giving
[58:09] their life
[58:10] laboring for the lord and giving their
[58:11] life and they were slaughtered by the
[58:13] millions it was the ox age
[58:15] it was the time is what their anointed
[58:18] was
[58:18] amen you might wonder how in the world
[58:20] these people uh
[58:22] you know were able to withstand the
[58:24] persecution and
[58:26] the being burnt at the stake being fed
[58:28] to lions and
[58:30] and you know i speak here
[58:33] but if we had if we would ever see
[58:37] the the atrocity that was committed
[58:40] by the catholic church down through that
[58:42] age it would make every one of us throw
[58:44] up
[58:45] it would be we would be forever scarred
[58:48] if we had to look upon a lot of that and
[58:50] see a lot of that happening
[58:51] to our wives to our children i mean they
[58:53] would take pregnant moms and
[58:55] and it's just horrible things they did
[58:58] it ripped the babies out feed it to pigs
[59:00] i mean you couldn't imagine what they
[59:02] went through isn't that right
[59:04] so that's what our brothers and sisters
[59:05] faced and but you know they went with
[59:07] the anointing that god anointed them
[59:10] with
[59:10] amen they were more than willing to die
[59:13] amen just as a man would lay down his
[59:15] life for
[59:16] somebody that he loves without
[59:17] hesitation that's the way that our
[59:20] brothers and sisters back then how they
[59:22] loved the lord
[59:23] so much that they didn't mind giving
[59:25] good life for the lord
[59:27] amen paul he was ready more than ready
[59:30] to go and have his head chopped off for
[59:32] the glory of god and for the sake of
[59:33] christ
[59:34] it was the anointing that they were
[59:36] under amen that was the second anointing
[59:39] the third anointing we understand
[59:40] through the power of god that
[59:42] it was the face of a man that was to
[59:44] martin luther coming up
[59:45] john wesley coming up and revival
[59:48] amen it was a time of man spreading the
[59:50] gospel and
[59:51] and so forth it was the face of man time
[59:54] isn't that right
[59:55] but the last anointing the last
[59:57] anointing and that was
[59:58] uh people like uh just all of those
[1:00:01] brothers i can't even begin to name it
[1:00:03] dwight moody and all these other
[1:00:05] brothers way back then
[1:00:06] you know that went out there and and
[1:00:08] began to spread the gospel with tracks
[1:00:10] and different things it did it was a
[1:00:11] man's a the face of a man time
[1:00:14] and then the last anointing that's upon
[1:00:17] the earth
[1:00:18] is a flying amen that's why we call this
[1:00:22] the eagle age we believe this
[1:00:24] is the eagle h now he believes we're
[1:00:26] living in the eagle age
[1:00:29] now the thing about it brothers and
[1:00:30] sisters if you're going to eat something
[1:00:32] if god is going to feed us something
[1:00:34] i believe that we as eagles cannot be
[1:00:37] content
[1:00:38] amen with perhaps what we call
[1:00:42] moses or noah's message i mean no we
[1:00:44] can't live by moses's message
[1:00:46] it may come out of egypt perhaps in a
[1:00:48] spiritual sense yet
[1:00:50] but we can't go with noah's message and
[1:00:52] go and build an ark so to speak
[1:00:54] isn't that right or even brother bob
[1:00:56] talked about paul's message and so forth
[1:00:58] you think about we're living in another
[1:01:00] time and god has given us another
[1:01:02] message
[1:01:02] he always gives us fresh manna
[1:01:06] amen the bible says in matthew there we
[1:01:08] won't go to it but it talks about
[1:01:10] wherever
[1:01:11] the carcass is there will the eagles be
[1:01:14] gathered together
[1:01:16] amen eagles eat meat from birth
[1:01:20] amen that's why message believer we as
[1:01:22] message believers
[1:01:23] we don't have a problem with the heavy
[1:01:26] meat of the word of god
[1:01:28] amen because that's what we like we like
[1:01:31] fresh kill how many likes fresh
[1:01:35] revelation i believe that's what jesus
[1:01:38] christ
[1:01:38] gives us is fresh revelation and if i
[1:01:42] don't say nothing else this morning i
[1:01:43] want to tell you
[1:01:44] i believe that's where 99.9
[1:01:48] of our problems come is that we don't
[1:01:51] have fresh revelation i don't know about
[1:01:53] you but i don't like
[1:01:54] amen i told my wife i said if you make a
[1:01:57] big old pot of something
[1:01:58] it's over three or four days old go
[1:02:00] ahead and give it to the chicken still
[1:02:02] enjoy it too
[1:02:03] i want something first i don't mind
[1:02:06] eating it for a few days but you know
[1:02:07] after a while
[1:02:08] you just want something fresh and i
[1:02:11] believe that's what i
[1:02:12] for myself that's what i thrive on it
[1:02:15] gives me
[1:02:16] prevailing as the prophet of god said he
[1:02:18] said revelation gives you prevailing
[1:02:20] power over the enemy
[1:02:24] so eagles we're living in the eagle age
[1:02:26] where we have to have meat where we can
[1:02:28] eat meat from birth
[1:02:31] amen praise the lord
[1:02:34] so we want to eat meat praise the lord
[1:02:36] we want to have a table how many
[1:02:37] believes that jesus has the table spread
[1:02:40] where the saints of god are fed
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:45] amen it can't be and i was thinking
[1:02:49] you know last night i said lord i
[1:02:50] believe i'm in the place
[1:02:52] lord where you can speak to me amen you
[1:02:55] can give me something to give to the
[1:02:57] people
[1:02:57] and i do realize that as a minister as a
[1:03:00] preacher
[1:03:01] how in the world is god going to give me
[1:03:03] something fresh
[1:03:04] how can he give me something if i'm not
[1:03:06] in the place for him to give me
[1:03:08] something
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:14] so that was one of the first questions
[1:03:16] when they in my in my
[1:03:17] thoughts in my mind that says thank you
[1:03:19] lord i believe i'm right with you i
[1:03:21] believe i'm here
[1:03:22] i'm in the place that you can give me
[1:03:23] something and i want you to know
[1:03:25] it wasn't 30 seconds later that he laid
[1:03:28] it upon my heart
[1:03:30] hello they begin to part out and i say
[1:03:32] lord i know
[1:03:34] that he i know you care about those
[1:03:37] people sitting there
[1:03:39] amen if i care about them how much more
[1:03:42] do you care about them he cares that you
[1:03:45] are fed this morning he cares
[1:03:47] that you are spiritually hydrated this
[1:03:50] morning
[1:03:51] he wants you to be a man fat so to speak
[1:03:56] amen he wants you to eat well
[1:04:01] amen praise be to god
[1:04:04] but you know i truly believe that god
[1:04:06] does get a table ready he's the one that
[1:04:08] gets the table ready
[1:04:09] amen brother bam says that the angel
[1:04:11] told the prophet of god he told brother
[1:04:13] branham
[1:04:13] he says you store up this food
[1:04:17] amen i'll tell you what it may be stored
[1:04:20] up in the freezer
[1:04:21] it may be but i'll tell you but when it
[1:04:23] comes back out i want you to know
[1:04:25] it's as though it was just as fresh
[1:04:28] today as it was cut
[1:04:30] amen start up why because we're gonna
[1:04:33] need it
[1:04:35] right now i mean at least we need that
[1:04:38] meat that god has stored up
[1:04:40] we need it right now you need it right
[1:04:44] now to sustain us
[1:04:45] in this evil age that we are living in
[1:04:48] the most
[1:04:49] horrible aid that was ever amen thought
[1:04:52] of
[1:04:52] satan in his eden is what
[1:04:57] coming right down to
[1:05:00] a financial collapse
[1:05:04] to where the devil can accomplish his
[1:05:06] purpose and that is that
[1:05:07] nobody's gonna buy nothing and nobody
[1:05:10] gonna sell nothing
[1:05:12] unless you belong to the mark of the
[1:05:13] beast
[1:05:15] the boycott amen
[1:05:19] isn't that right john paul i believe he
[1:05:21] says there's a crash coming there's an
[1:05:23] economic crash coming and all and so
[1:05:24] forth
[1:05:25] hey they're not so rough they're
[1:05:26] absolutely right there is going to
[1:05:28] squeeze the financial squeeze coming
[1:05:29] that's going to squeeze everybody amen
[1:05:32] and i said
[1:05:33] i had a truckload of concrete come to my
[1:05:35] door the other day
[1:05:36] and they don't even want to send me a
[1:05:38] bill they want to send me the bill over
[1:05:39] my text messages they'll tell me where
[1:05:41] the truck is this saturday other than
[1:05:43] the driver company says by next year
[1:05:45] they don't want to take your check or
[1:05:46] your cash they want to do it through a
[1:05:48] card
[1:05:51] huh well if i can't buy concrete unless
[1:05:53] i belong to
[1:05:55] have some cars or whatever it is that's
[1:05:57] pretty terrible ain't it but
[1:05:58] i thought boy that's a wake-up call
[1:06:00] folks the whole economy everything's
[1:06:02] coming down
[1:06:02] to a cashless society it's coming down
[1:06:05] to where they're going to make to where
[1:06:06] you either are part of it or you're not
[1:06:08] a part of it
[1:06:09] you won't buy or sell and that's where
[1:06:11] the devil's coming to but i want you to
[1:06:12] know that god
[1:06:13] is getting a people ready how many
[1:06:16] believes that there is
[1:06:17] rapturing faith in this table of food
[1:06:20] that god has
[1:06:22] you and i listen very very carefully
[1:06:24] you're going to either have this body to
[1:06:26] be
[1:06:27] changed amen you might go by the way of
[1:06:30] the grave
[1:06:32] some of us are getting a little older we
[1:06:35] might go by the way on the ground but
[1:06:36] we had better be so in tune with god
[1:06:39] like i said wednesday
[1:06:40] we better have the kind of fellowship
[1:06:42] with god that is ready for the rapture
[1:06:46] amen rapture ready the kind of
[1:06:48] fellowship that enoch had that whenever
[1:06:50] he walked he pleased god
[1:06:53] how many believes that's the kind of
[1:06:54] walk that he's looking for a deeper walk
[1:06:57] with almighty god
[1:06:58] amen if we get that through eating what
[1:07:00] the word of god

[1:07:11] tell you something
[1:07:12] you know what i just want to say i truly
[1:07:13] believe that a lot of our problems
[1:07:16] come because we are not spiritually
[1:07:19] eating the way that we should
[1:07:24] amen because if you're eating right i'll
[1:07:28] tell you what you're not gonna be
[1:07:29] skinny amen
[1:07:34] no you're gonna be spiritually healthy
[1:07:38] and god has the food prepared for us
[1:07:42] jesus has a table spread how many knows
[1:07:44] what he said
[1:07:45] he had that food already formed danielle
[1:07:48] he said was
[1:07:49] come and dine how many of these oh
[1:07:52] that's right every other like that like
[1:07:54] by the time he was reading every other
[1:07:55] religion
[1:07:56] amen they make you work for it and they
[1:07:58] still don't end up giving you eternal
[1:08:00] life
[1:08:00] redemption or anything like that jesus
[1:08:03] gives it all to you free and he says
[1:08:04] come
[1:08:05] receive it of it freely and people still
[1:08:07] don't want it
[1:08:09] well they don't have to get it but i'll
[1:08:10] tell you what if it's free i like it
[1:08:13] i'll take it i'll accept it and then no
[1:08:16] matter if it costs me whatever it cost
[1:08:18] me i don't mind whatever it is
[1:08:20] lord that's what i want we're a
[1:08:23] privileged people
[1:08:25] amen hallelujah
[1:08:28] god is good so let's let's just look at
[1:08:31] a couple scriptures of what jesus said
[1:08:35] amen about eating and what
[1:08:38] is truly food because he wants us to eat
[1:08:41] but we got to know what we're going to
[1:08:42] eat
[1:08:43] first of all i believe it has to be
[1:08:45] fresh revelation
[1:08:48] fresh meat fresh food
[1:08:51] can't have wiggle tails in it let me
[1:08:54] tell you something so many people
[1:08:56] and so many preachers are preaching from
[1:08:57] a past experience
[1:09:00] people are living by our past experience
[1:09:03] maybe you are living by your experience
[1:09:05] of god yesterday that don't work for
[1:09:07] today
[1:09:08] you gotta have an experience with god
[1:09:10] today a daily walk with god
[1:09:16] before we go to saint john 6 i want to
[1:09:19] go back all the way back to isaiah
[1:09:24] isaiah 55 praise the lord
[1:09:29] i preach on this different times i know
[1:09:31] but i really like it
[1:09:34] amen isaiah 55
[1:09:37] one of my favorite scriptures when it
[1:09:39] comes to eating and drinking
[1:09:41] amen praise the lord
[1:09:46] god says to the people chapter 55 hug
[1:09:52] whoa oh i don't know it does help he

[1:10:07] and thirst you can lead a horse to water
[1:10:11] but you can't make him great
[1:10:13] and if he's real thirsty you don't have
[1:10:15] to lead him doing he'll run you over

[1:10:38] thing that we can do we can get together
[1:10:40] we can eat something that really does
[1:10:42] make us feel better
[1:10:43] that really does bring joy in our life
[1:10:46] something that we can drink that really
[1:10:47] does satisfy

[1:11:47] gonna drink you're just gonna sit
[1:11:53] depends there if you're thirsty
[1:11:58] do you realize this morning that a
[1:12:01] preacher
[1:12:02] in order to get something from god he
[1:12:04] has to get away in a secret place and he
[1:12:06] has begun to go down in his soul
[1:12:08] he has to begin to dig deep and say god
[1:12:11] here i am
[1:12:11] help me more to get something from you
[1:12:14] lord here i am lord and begin to dig
[1:12:16] down deep

[1:12:25] down and begin to search your soul
[1:12:27] and to get a little more serious about
[1:12:29] the whole thing
[1:12:30] and when you get real serious about it i
[1:12:32] want you to know god will come and do
[1:12:34] something
[1:12:34] but as long as you ain't got the
[1:12:36] sincerity that you're supposed to have
[1:12:37] you won't get anything
[1:12:43] we got to give our sincere about it we
[1:12:45] got to dig deep
[1:12:48] begin to say god here i am
[1:12:52] i gotta have more i want more

[1:12:58] perseverance desperation

[1:13:05] being lukewarm
[1:13:09] happy go daisy lazy
[1:13:13] so if you want more god you got to dig a
[1:13:16] little deeper

[1:15:13] almighty god
[1:15:14] sure we all raise our hands but yet god

[1:15:18] he's more more serious about it than
[1:15:19] what we are about wanting a deeper
[1:15:21] fellowship with us a daily walk
[1:15:25] now at the end of the service perhaps if
[1:15:27] i don't get to it first and mess my
[1:15:28] message all up

[1:15:39] that we're eating on the word of god
[1:15:40] there's going to be things that show
[1:15:41] that we truly are
[1:15:43] amen again
[1:15:46] let him come amen come yay and all
[1:15:50] that's our thirst come
[1:15:51] now notice he says come by

[1:15:58] buy wine and milk without
[1:16:01] money and without price
[1:16:04] amen praise the lord
[1:16:08] wherefore do ye spend money for that
[1:16:10] which is not
[1:16:11] bread jesus said in the red letters he
[1:16:14] says you know
[1:16:15] labor not for the meat that perishes
[1:16:18] but labor for the meat that lasts unto
[1:16:20] everlasting life
[1:16:23] praise the lord now notice
[1:16:27] wherefore do you spend money for that
[1:16:28] which is not bread and your labor for
[1:16:30] that which satisfieth not
[1:16:33] hearken diligently unto me and eat that
[1:16:36] but it is good
[1:16:38] that your and let your soul delight
[1:16:42] itself in go ahead
[1:16:46] i can't hear you fatness
[1:16:50] if you hear that oh the terrible word
[1:16:53] fat
[1:16:54] oh fat
[1:16:58] none of us like that word oh no it's a
[1:17:00] horrible word
[1:17:02] but now when it comes to spiritual he
[1:17:05] says let your soul
[1:17:07] delight itself in fatness
[1:17:10] praise the lord hallelujah
[1:17:14] now we go to saint don let's see what
[1:17:17] jesus said here
[1:17:18] [Music]
[1:17:21] i've got wrote down here verse 26
[1:17:26] well right here it is jesus in chapter 6
[1:17:28] of saint john
[1:17:30] and verse 26 jesus answered him and said
[1:17:35] verily i say unto you you seek me
[1:17:39] not because you saw the miracles but
[1:17:41] because you didn't eat the loaves
[1:17:44] and were filled
[1:17:48] labor not for the meat which perishes
[1:17:49] but for that meat which endureth unto
[1:17:51] everlasting life which the son of man
[1:17:54] shall give
[1:17:55] unto you for him hath the father
[1:17:59] seal amen
[1:18:04] now verse 32 then jesus said unto them
[1:18:08] verily i say unto you
[1:18:09] moses gave you not that bread from
[1:18:12] heaven but my father giveth you
[1:18:14] the true bread from heaven
[1:18:18] let me ask you some how many knows that
[1:18:20] this this eating of bread this eating of
[1:18:22] food and this drinking of water
[1:18:25] it is a matter of life or death
[1:18:30] it's a matter of life for death if you
[1:18:32] don't eat you're going to starve
[1:18:34] if you don't drink you're going to
[1:18:35] dehydrate
[1:18:37] you're going to shrivel up and pass away
[1:18:41] amen it is the same spiritually if you
[1:18:43] aren't eating
[1:18:44] spiritually if you're not drinking
[1:18:46] spiritually you're going to dehydrate
[1:18:49] and jesus says i am the true bread from
[1:18:52] heaven
[1:18:53] for the bread of god which is which he
[1:18:57] which he which cometh down is he which
[1:19:00] cometh down from heaven
[1:19:01] and giveth life unto the world
[1:19:05] life-giving bread and jesus said unto no
[1:19:08] notice then said they unto him lord
[1:19:10] evermore give us this bread
[1:19:13] i am the bread of life he that cometh to
[1:19:16] me shall never hunger
[1:19:21] and he that believeth on me shall
[1:19:24] never thirst amen
[1:19:28] how many knows whenever you take jesus
[1:19:30] into your heart
[1:19:31] it brings the satisfaction
[1:19:34] amen it satisfies you it causes you
[1:19:37] never to be hungry again
[1:19:39] now let's go to verse 48 quick
[1:19:43] verse 48 again he says i am the bread of
[1:19:46] life
[1:19:47] your father is the man in the wilderness
[1:19:50] and are dead
[1:19:51] and this is the bread which cometh down
[1:19:53] from heaven that a man may eat thereof
[1:19:56] and not die
[1:20:00] amen i am the living bread which cometh
[1:20:03] down from heaven
[1:20:04] if any man eat of this bread he shall
[1:20:06] live forever
[1:20:07] and the bread that i will give is my
[1:20:09] flesh
[1:20:10] which i will give for the life of the
[1:20:12] world now notice this is one time
[1:20:15] that jesus was giving them meat to eat
[1:20:19] and they couldn't handle it they
[1:20:21] couldn't handle the meat
[1:20:22] that he was given
[1:20:26] this is where it begins to tell them
[1:20:28] something that in verse
[1:20:29] 66 says from that time many of his
[1:20:33] disciples went
[1:20:34] back and walked no more with him
[1:20:38] because they said if i'm not wrong
[1:20:42] they said who can hear it this is a hard
[1:20:44] saying
[1:20:45] who can hear it and the jews stroll
[1:20:49] amongst themselves back to verse 52
[1:20:52] jesus saying how can this man give us
[1:20:55] his flesh to eat
[1:20:57] then said jesus unto them verily verily
[1:21:01] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:21:04] man and drink his blood
[1:21:05] he have no life in you
[1:21:09] amen who so eateth my flesh and drinketh
[1:21:14] my blood
[1:21:14] hath eternal life and i will raise him
[1:21:17] up at the last day
[1:21:18] now i don't know about you but if you'd
[1:21:20] have been standing there and you heard
[1:21:21] somebody say
[1:21:22] you're gonna have to eat my flesh and
[1:21:24] drink my blood if you want eternal life
[1:21:26] we'd have probably had a problem
[1:21:30] you've heard this before many times and
[1:21:32] illustrated but if it was your first
[1:21:34] time
[1:21:35] hearing it from some stranger somebody
[1:21:36] you don't really know saying that
[1:21:38] hello it would have taken something way
[1:21:41] down on the inside for you to stay with
[1:21:43] him
[1:21:44] because at one point point he says will
[1:21:47] you jesus even said to his disciples
[1:21:49] he says will you also go away they
[1:21:52] almost
[1:21:53] all forsook him because of some of the
[1:21:54] things that he said
[1:21:56] how many knows that when we say certain
[1:21:58] things out of the bible some people
[1:21:59] can't handle it they just
[1:22:00] no no no they go away you can't handle
[1:22:02] it but every last word of god
[1:22:04] is part of jesus's flesh
[1:22:08] it's part of god you can't deny any of
[1:22:11] it
[1:22:12] amen my flesh is mean indeed and my
[1:22:15] blood
[1:22:16] is drink indeed he that eateth and drink
[1:22:20] he that eats my flesh and drinks my
[1:22:22] blood
[1:22:23] now notice how do you eat your flesh and
[1:22:26] drink your slice and drink his blood eat
[1:22:28] his sled and drinks but
[1:22:29] it meant by here's the answer this is
[1:22:31] how it's done
[1:22:33] dwelleth in me and i in him
[1:22:37] how many knows that's why how you take
[1:22:39] jesus in that's how you drink him
[1:22:41] that's why we take drink of the cup we
[1:22:43] represent the blood of jesus christ
[1:22:45] amen we have accepted and received of
[1:22:49] his spirit because his spirit that
[1:22:52] is him that's his body this is his body
[1:22:55] this word is his body
[1:22:57] and when you accept what he says he that
[1:23:00] believeth on me
[1:23:01] shall never die amen you're accepting
[1:23:05] the body of
[1:23:06] christ praise be to god
[1:23:09] and you eat his flesh drink his blood
[1:23:11] you have life in you
[1:23:13] and you'll never perish that's the only
[1:23:15] way to have everlasting life
[1:23:17] eternal life to actually be alive
[1:23:21] because i'm here to tell you there's so
[1:23:23] many people claiming the
[1:23:25] name of jesus that are actually dead
[1:23:28] amen they're dried up dehydrated
[1:23:32] amen how many believes that dehydrated
[1:23:37] amen notice and when jesus
[1:23:40] verse 61 and when jesus knew in himself
[1:23:43] that his disciples disciples murmured at
[1:23:45] it
[1:23:45] he said unto them does this offend you
[1:23:48] why didn't if you shall see the son of
[1:23:50] man ascend to where he was before
[1:23:52] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[1:23:55] flesh prophetess nothing
[1:23:57] the words that i speak unto you they are
[1:24:00] spirit
[1:24:00] and they are life
[1:24:04] how many believes the word of god is
[1:24:06] life
[1:24:09] amen now first of all let me say this
[1:24:12] that
[1:24:12] when you come to jesus's table when you
[1:24:15] come
[1:24:16] to church because this is jesus table
[1:24:18] right here
[1:24:21] normally when you come to a table you
[1:24:24] want to have it all set
[1:24:27] everything is set the plates are there
[1:24:32] the knife the fork the spoon the napkins
[1:24:35] over to your right
[1:24:36] your glass is there perhaps filled with
[1:24:38] water isn't that right
[1:24:40] you have your vegetable dish
[1:24:44] amen and hopefully a good old pecan pie
[1:24:46] for dessert
[1:24:47] amen you have your main dish maybe a
[1:24:50] turkey or whatever it'll be here pretty
[1:24:51] soon at thanksgiving
[1:24:53] everything you said amen
[1:24:57] what does mama say supper is ready come
[1:25:00] and get it
[1:25:01] huh or she'll say get ready to eat
[1:25:07] how many knows when we come 30 minutes
[1:25:09] early and a lot of y'all's doing better
[1:25:11] on that coming early you're getting
[1:25:13] ready to eat
[1:25:15] lord jesus i got frustrated yesterday
[1:25:19] you already i didn't know i maybe made a
[1:25:20] mistake here there god i want you to
[1:25:22] forgive me lord i want to be ready
[1:25:26] amen mama can you come on to the table
[1:25:28] and guess what you've been out there and
[1:25:30] you know and you've been doing mechanic
[1:25:31] work maybe you got all your hands greasy
[1:25:34] hey man she'll say get over there to
[1:25:36] that wash base and get some of that goo
[1:25:38] goo go go go whatever that stuff it
[1:25:40] get it in your hands and wash up real
[1:25:42] good why because she don't want you to
[1:25:44] come to
[1:25:45] the table and then you're not said to
[1:25:47] eat with dirty hands
[1:25:50] are you reading between the lines have
[1:25:51] you got dirty hands and the one rule
[1:25:54] of eating at jesus table is that you've
[1:25:56] got to have clean hands
[1:25:59] [Music]
[1:26:02] and not just at church but out there
[1:26:04] when you're going home from church and
[1:26:05] you're playing that tape where if you go
[1:26:07] on the next day
[1:26:08] you're listening to the bible or
[1:26:09] whatever it is if you want to get
[1:26:12] something from god
[1:26:13] you have to have clean hands
[1:26:17] you've got to have a clean heart
[1:26:19] otherwise you come to church and you're
[1:26:21] just sitting there
[1:26:22] and you ain't getting a thing because
[1:26:23] you ain't got your hands clean
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:26] god ain't coming and giving you fresh
[1:26:28] revelation with all kinds of dirt on you
[1:26:31] the first thing you gotta do is get your
[1:26:33] heart right
[1:26:34] you got to be right folks i want you to
[1:26:36] know if that rapture comes and you ain't
[1:26:38] right you ain't going
[1:26:44] to be right there how many believes at
[1:26:47] first you got to have clean heart you
[1:26:48] got to be
[1:26:49] clean that's why sometimes i wonder if
[1:26:51] we don't come to church
[1:26:53] amen and we don't get anything
[1:26:56] we might have our minds tingle a little
[1:26:58] bit and tantalize with something new
[1:27:00] that the preacher said but it didn't
[1:27:02] ever go all the way down in the heart
[1:27:06] huh how many places got to go all the
[1:27:08] way down in the heart
[1:27:09] this is where it's got to go to amen
[1:27:14] amen it's got to come here
[1:27:22] can you imagine what it'd be like coming
[1:27:25] on church
[1:27:26] on sunday morning wednesday night if tom
[1:27:29] was in the bottler would never get a
[1:27:30] fresh revelation
[1:27:32] huh never get a fresh revelation
[1:27:39] let me tell you something it would be
[1:27:41] kind of stagnant
[1:27:43] it would be kind of old huh
[1:27:47] wouldn't be very good
[1:27:50] because i don't know about you but i
[1:27:52] like with a preacher i don't care
[1:27:53] what it is just so it's fresh
[1:27:58] just so it's the holy spirit doing it
[1:28:00] and not the preacher as long as
[1:28:01] it's that way it's always fresh
[1:28:05] we can go back to the beginning in the
[1:28:07] beginning god
[1:28:09] created the heavens and the earth
[1:28:12] hallelujah it's fresh why because it's
[1:28:15] in the presence of god
[1:28:16] we know all of these people are trying
[1:28:18] to say we come from a monkey we know
[1:28:20] that's all
[1:28:21] a bunch of rubbish it's all god
[1:28:24] created it all
[1:28:27] amen it was wednesday night it was fresh
[1:28:29] to me when i began to think back
[1:28:31] of how god was back there all by himself
[1:28:34] before he created the first
[1:28:36] thing before the first stardust was ever
[1:28:38] made before this thirst
[1:28:40] for star wars ever made he had you on
[1:28:43] his mind he had
[1:28:44] me on his mind and then god began to
[1:28:47] create the heavens and he
[1:28:48] does something for you
[1:28:55] folks i'm telling you if you had five
[1:28:57] hot dogs this morning and a
[1:28:58] glass of arsenic you aren't gonna be too
[1:29:01] healthy you're not gonna feel too good
[1:29:05] you can't just drink arsenic and expect
[1:29:07] to have a holy ghost-filled service
[1:29:10] amen everything that's poisoned there's
[1:29:12] the things of this world the vileness
[1:29:14] and the corruption of the world
[1:29:16] and that's all just poison in your
[1:29:18] system
[1:29:19] that thing you'll ever do is think about
[1:29:21] god in your jobs and wherever you are
[1:29:23] get your eye mind on god focus on god
[1:29:26] it's the only place that you'll ever get
[1:29:28] joy the only place you'll ever get life
[1:29:31] when you've got a consecrated life amen
[1:29:33] and you love
[1:29:34] church you love the word of god you love
[1:29:36] prayer you're going to be a happy person
[1:29:39] get away from that and i'm telling you
[1:29:41] there's going to be sorrow and grief and
[1:29:43] despair
[1:29:43] amen the best life is a good all holy
[1:29:46] ghost feel life
[1:29:48] that loves church loves the word of god
[1:29:51] and loves to be a witness to others
[1:29:54] and to feed other people remember jesus
[1:29:56] fed them
[1:29:57] and he says now you feed others i
[1:30:00] believe every last one of them ought to
[1:30:01] be in the place that we can actually
[1:30:03] feed
[1:30:04] somebody else somebody else should be
[1:30:06] able to say brother i never saw it that
[1:30:08] way
[1:30:08] amen that's good i like that huh
[1:30:12] to be able to feed others jesus was very
[1:30:15] concerned with peter
[1:30:16] peter i want you to know that i want my
[1:30:19] feature
[1:30:20] and my sheep fed i want a pet i want a
[1:30:23] bed

[1:30:28] amen praise the lord
[1:30:36] i didn't bring my acorns i gathered a
[1:30:38] bunch of acres brother jeff
[1:30:39] i'm going to dump a bunch of that maker
[1:30:41] in there where i'm hunting at you know
[1:30:43] see if that'll help the deer come but i
[1:30:45] got some
[1:30:46] got some acorns out there i don't have
[1:30:49] it here with me i wish i bought me an
[1:30:50] acorn
[1:30:52] but i got them acres and i knew i should
[1:30:53] spread them out tommy you know spread
[1:30:55] them out
[1:30:56] so they don't start growing they'll dry
[1:30:58] out good maybe i can use it next year
[1:31:00] and at the beginning of the year when
[1:31:01] they got on they'll come you know you're
[1:31:03] always trying to figure out this buck
[1:31:04] you know you
[1:31:05] gotta use your head when you're trying
[1:31:06] to get that guy
[1:31:08] but anyway that little acorn that i
[1:31:10] thought about that aiken of course they
[1:31:12] spotted but listen that little acorn
[1:31:14] we know that that little acre every
[1:31:17] acorn it'll ever have
[1:31:19] every acre will ever be produced for
[1:31:21] every deer that'll ever sit under that
[1:31:23] tree and eat
[1:31:24] it's all in that one little thing right
[1:31:28] there
[1:31:30] amen but all it has to do is to be
[1:31:32] planet
[1:31:34] just plant it in the ground and then
[1:31:36] what do you do
[1:31:38] amen i don't know about you but i
[1:31:40] remember taking the old meal not the
[1:31:42] meal but the old horse
[1:31:43] amen and taking that little harrow down
[1:31:45] through the garden at home
[1:31:48] amen putting play potatoes in there
[1:31:51] putting carrots in there putting this
[1:31:53] after the other but the last thing we
[1:31:55] did
[1:31:56] was get a buckets and buckets of water
[1:31:59] and that right
[1:32:00] and we found each plant dump a good
[1:32:02] portion of water
[1:32:04] a good portion of water because you know
[1:32:06] when you plant something like that and
[1:32:08] if you don't water it
[1:32:10] it won't grow how many knows it has to
[1:32:12] have
[1:32:13] water for that little thing to grow
[1:32:16] and you take an apple tree amen and you

[1:35:39] we know we as human beings we have to
[1:35:41] drink milk for a while
[1:35:43] and that right but after a while
[1:35:50] you try to give them a little bit
[1:35:52] heavier food as they grow up
[1:35:55] and brother ben talked about the
[1:35:56] corinthians church how did
[1:35:58] paul said he couldn't give him any meat
[1:36:00] right

[1:36:06] third chapter verse 1. now brethren
[1:36:10] and brethren i brethren could not speak
[1:36:12] unto you as spiritual

[1:40:07] right
[1:40:08] all that's grown by the wayside we as
[1:40:10] adults and we as christians

[1:40:13] wayside
[1:40:16] same way with the marriage hello with

[1:40:46] it i mean that's how to get along
[1:40:48] amen that's adults
[1:40:52] not babies anymore able to handle the
[1:40:55] meat
[1:40:56] over in ephesians let's go and look at
[1:40:58] some of the meats good
[1:40:59] good heavy meat stuff eagle food i call
[1:41:02] it how many knows but eagle
[1:41:05] revelation deep revelation the deep
[1:41:08] things of god
[1:41:09] you find in ephesians but man says that
[1:41:11] the ephesian church
[1:41:13] paul never had to tell the ephesian
[1:41:15] church he thinks
[1:41:16] he could teach him the deep things of
[1:41:19] god
[1:41:20] the real things that meant you would
[1:41:22] have never known before
[1:41:25] like ephesians 1
[1:41:29] we'll begin with verse 2 grace be unto
[1:41:31] you and peace from god our father and
[1:41:33] from the lord jesus christ
[1:41:35] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:41:37] lord jesus christ who has blessed
[1:41:39] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:41:42] heavenly places in christ
[1:41:43] according as he has chosen us
[1:41:47] in him before the foundation of the
[1:41:50] world
[1:41:51] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:41:54] before
[1:41:54] him in love having predestinated us
[1:41:59] unto the adoption praise the lord
[1:42:04] another scripture comes to mind if i can
[1:42:05] find it right quick i believe it's in
[1:42:07] romans
[1:42:08] the 8th chapter romans 8 bears this out
[1:42:11] also
[1:42:12] some people don't like predestination
[1:42:14] for knowledge isn't that right
[1:42:16] he was beginning to tell them where they
[1:42:19] come from
[1:42:20] he began to tell them who they are where
[1:42:23] are they going to be at
[1:42:25] and i want you to know that's one of the
[1:42:28] that's one of the the three biggest
[1:42:31] questions
[1:42:32] in life where did you come from
[1:42:35] who are you and where are you going to
[1:42:38] end up at
[1:42:39] is that right the two big three biggest
[1:42:41] questions
[1:42:43] where'd you come from who are you and if
[1:42:46] you get those answers
[1:42:47] you'll be a happy person you'll be a
[1:42:50] happy person
[1:42:51] you'll be a fulfilled person because
[1:42:52] there's a lot of them out there that
[1:42:54] like the agnostics they
[1:42:56] don't know whether there is a god or
[1:42:57] isn't the god and you know
[1:42:59] there's no hope no future
[1:43:03] just nothing what a horrible place to be
[1:43:12] oh i was gonna say even the uh
[1:43:17] hindus have a better religion than
[1:43:19] nothing
[1:43:20] they either think dear a god or that bug
[1:43:23] down there's a god at least to make
[1:43:24] something out of something
[1:43:26] but man to have nothing out of nothing
[1:43:28] that's really a terrible place to be
[1:43:30] but both are bad don't get me wrong but
[1:43:33] now listen
[1:43:35] romans 8 28 for we know that all things
[1:43:38] work together for them that love god to
[1:43:40] them who are the called according to his
[1:43:42] purpose
[1:43:43] for who he did for no
[1:43:47] amen
[1:43:50] but i'll tell you what you know when you
[1:43:52] talk about what i need to do and what
[1:43:54] you need to do what you don't do
[1:43:55] what i don't do that we ought to do and
[1:43:57] all of that stuff you know might get a
[1:43:59] little depressed
[1:44:01] but here's one thing sure when you talk
[1:44:04] about what god has
[1:44:06] done amen and what he has thought
[1:44:09] it's never depressing amen what he
[1:44:12] foreknew
[1:44:13] for whom he did for no he did also
[1:44:16] predestinate
[1:44:17] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:44:19] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:44:21] many brethren moreover who he did
[1:44:24] predestinate
[1:44:25] amen demi also called and whom he called
[1:44:28] them he
[1:44:29] also justified and who he justified them
[1:44:32] he
[1:44:33] also glorified if god before us what
[1:44:35] shall we say then to thee things of god
[1:44:37] before us
[1:44:38] who can be against us how many knows now
[1:44:41] that
[1:44:42] is heavy meat that's real meat
[1:44:46] and we never understood it the way that
[1:44:48] we do until malachi 4 came along and
[1:44:51] showed us
[1:44:52] until the opening of the seals amen
[1:44:55] until god opened this
[1:44:56] revelation of the seven seals and showed
[1:44:58] us how the antichrist would come in how
[1:45:00] god's spirit moved down through the last
[1:45:02] 2 000 years
[1:45:03] and how these in this end time he'll do
[1:45:05] his other best
[1:45:07] to absolutely drown us with world and
[1:45:09] the cares of life and everything else
[1:45:11] trying to make us lukewarm you realize
[1:45:14] that's what darnell right that's his
[1:45:15] ambition to you this morning
[1:45:17] is to try to get you to be lukewarm just
[1:45:20] relaxed not dig down deep
[1:45:25] just kind of float along amen
[1:45:30] one more scripture on the on the line of
[1:45:32] me it's in revelations
[1:45:35] 10.
[1:45:41] now it's uh 13 revelations 13
[1:45:45] and 8 that's where it is
[1:45:50] in verse 7 we'll begin with verse 7 and
[1:45:53] it was given unto him to make war with
[1:45:55] the saints and to overcome them
[1:45:58] and the power was given unto him over
[1:46:00] all kindreds
[1:46:01] and tongues and nations and all
[1:46:05] that dwell upon the earth shall worship
[1:46:08] him
[1:46:09] whose names are
[1:46:13] notice are not will be or were
[1:46:17] but are written whose names are not
[1:46:21] written in the book of life of the lamb
[1:46:25] slain
[1:46:26] from the foundation of the world amen
[1:46:28] all whose names
[1:46:30] are not written amen
[1:46:34] but what is it those who are written
[1:46:37] won't be deceived and then it would be
[1:46:40] so did his leaving that
[1:46:41] if it were possible the bible says the
[1:46:44] elected would even be deceived but it's
[1:46:46] not possible
[1:46:47] if it was amen billy graham he
[1:46:51] says you know it's gotten so deceiving
[1:46:52] until even the elected are being
[1:46:54] deceived by the man comes along says no
[1:46:56] the bible says if it were possible it
[1:46:59] will come
[1:47:00] to me and i will not cast them out
[1:47:04] no man plucketh them out of my hands i
[1:47:07] will lose
[1:47:08] none of them how many believes that the
[1:47:10] viewer
[1:47:11] a child of god that you was in god
[1:47:13] before the foundation of the world
[1:47:16] and god knew he says i am the in the
[1:47:18] ending
[1:47:20] he knows the beginning he already knows
[1:47:22] the end
[1:47:23] he knows what the new millennium will be
[1:47:25] like he knows what the new heavens and
[1:47:26] everything like he knows whose names are
[1:47:28] written who he knew
[1:47:30] he knows who would and who wouldn't you
[1:47:32] and i don't not until you make that
[1:47:34] decision god i want to serve you with
[1:47:36] all of my heart
[1:47:37] god comes on and he confirms it with you
[1:47:39] filling you with the holy spirit
[1:47:41] giving you the desires of god and
[1:47:43] showing you that you
[1:47:44] are a son of god how many please the
[1:47:45] holy spirit has to show you that your
[1:47:47] son of god
[1:47:50] how is it that paul said that if i can
[1:47:52] just remind it
[1:47:53] he says now if any man have not the
[1:47:55] spirit of god he is none of his
[1:47:57] amen it's by the spirit bears record
[1:48:00] with our spirit that's what it is
[1:48:02] his spirit bears record with our spirit
[1:48:05] that we are
[1:48:06] the children of god ain't you like
[1:48:09] that's your son
[1:48:10] you're a dawn of god i say that to
[1:48:12] brother brian because i
[1:48:13] have watched him over the last 30 years
[1:48:15] and i know he knows
[1:48:17] believes with all his heart that he's
[1:48:18] the son of god and his bare life bears
[1:48:21] out with it amen
[1:48:22] how many knows that your life has to
[1:48:23] bear out that you are a son of god
[1:48:27] heaven and earth will pass away but
[1:48:28] you'll never pass away
[1:48:30] nothing will ever move you from being
[1:48:31] the son and daughter of god if you're a
[1:48:32] son and daughter of god
[1:48:34] amen that's maybe neat for some people
[1:48:37] some people don't believe in
[1:48:37] predestination in the foreknowledge of
[1:48:39] god
[1:48:40] but i believe it i know that god is
[1:48:42] infinite he knows all things
[1:48:44] he knows danny would get baptized in the
[1:48:47] name of the lord if it doesn't all end
[1:48:48] before we get to the water
[1:48:50] hello he knew danny would give his life
[1:48:52] to the lord that he would be baptized in
[1:48:54] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:48:56] he knew every one of us he knew where
[1:48:58] each and every one of us he would sit
[1:49:00] this morning
[1:49:00] he knew i'd be here preaching the gospel
[1:49:03] amen he knows your heart this morning
[1:49:05] how many know jesus is right there
[1:49:07] he knows what you're thinking he knows
[1:49:08] the condition of your heart
[1:49:10] let me close with this we'll get into
[1:49:12] the baptism but you know one way of
[1:49:13] telling
[1:49:14] amen whether you're really uh eating the
[1:49:17] way that you ought to eat
[1:49:18] is if whether you're spiritually healthy
[1:49:20] or not
[1:49:22] amen whether you're happy or not how
[1:49:24] many believes the
[1:49:25] joy of the lord is our strength
[1:49:28] amen brother man says you know we ought
[1:49:30] to be the happiest people upon the face
[1:49:32] of the earth

[1:49:40] different religions and yet you ought to

[1:50:15] sometimes just wherever i am
[1:50:17] down and wherever i am there's just so
[1:50:19] much joy
[1:50:20] i just can't hardly stand it i'm like
[1:50:22] man
[1:50:24] how can anybody not want to feel like
[1:50:26] this
[1:50:30] you have such peace that you know that
[1:50:32] you don't have to worry about death
[1:50:34] you don't have to worry about there
[1:50:35] being in the casket you know what's on
[1:50:37] the other side
[1:50:38] you know what's laying there for you you
[1:50:40] know him you know jesus and that's all
[1:50:42] that matters
[1:50:43] you're feeding on the word of god and
[1:50:45] it's bringing joy
[1:50:46] you feel like that little calf that was
[1:50:48] fatted over the winter amen
[1:50:49] when she opened them doors up she come
[1:50:51] out there blind
[1:50:53] she or you know this calf calf don't
[1:50:55] make any civilized sound brother jet
[1:50:57] they go
[1:51:00] they make all kinds of great but they
[1:51:01] just bellow it out why because they're
[1:51:03] happy because like
[1:51:04] our children another when a child is
[1:51:06] good and healthy
[1:51:07] it's hard to keep them quiet they go
[1:51:10] outside to church here and they'll run
[1:51:12] and they're just screaming for no
[1:51:14] apparent reason
[1:51:15] but i'll tell you what when they're sick
[1:51:17] and they're hungry and they're
[1:51:18] dehydrated
[1:51:24] that's the way we are spiritually if
[1:51:26] you're not spiritual you're all droopy
[1:51:28] and you're all you know they're not
[1:51:30] happy
[1:51:32] but if you've got the joy of the lord
[1:51:33] the peace of god that's a good sign
[1:51:35] you're healthy and you're eating the way
[1:51:36] that you ought to eat
[1:51:38] because i want you to know you can't
[1:51:40] feed on anything else the holy ghost
[1:51:42] will only feed on this word that's all
[1:51:43] it'll feed on
[1:51:45] we won't get into over in isaiah or
[1:51:48] in ezekiel where god told ezekiel to go
[1:51:51] and eat the scroll eat the scroll eat
[1:51:54] the book
[1:51:55] amen said the same thing in his stomach
[1:51:57] it was sweet as honey it may go over to
[1:51:59] revelations right after revelations 10
[1:52:01] and 7
[1:52:01] he says john eat the book
[1:52:05] eat the book i want to say this morning
[1:52:08] church eat the book
[1:52:10] eat the it says eat the book that the
[1:52:12] angel holds in his hand that is open
[1:52:15] i eat the book and you'll prophesy
[1:52:17] before other people
[1:52:19] you'll tell other people prophesy and so
[1:52:20] forth yes the end is coming we're in the
[1:52:22] end of the world
[1:52:24] amen prophesy to him one more time bride
[1:52:27] the bride's going to buy it prophesy as
[1:52:29] she eats the book
[1:52:31] amen then you become satisfied so my
[1:52:33] question this morning
[1:52:35] amen with our heads bowed
[1:52:39] are you truly in your heart can you say
[1:52:43] that you have such peace with god
[1:52:46] that it passes understanding you just
[1:52:49] can't explain it
[1:52:52] or this morning do you sit this morning
[1:52:54] and this is who i really care i want you
[1:52:56] right with god and have that peace but
[1:52:57] i'm concerned
[1:52:58] for anybody here that would not have
[1:53:00] that peace
[1:53:02] that joy unspeakable that would actually
[1:53:04] give you joy out there wherever you are
[1:53:06] that
[1:53:06] you just about burst you need another
[1:53:08] person to fill some more of this up with
[1:53:11] you're just so overjoyed or do you not
[1:53:13] have those experiences
[1:53:14] anymore and i want to tell you i truly
[1:53:17] believe if
[1:53:18] if you don't have it it's because you
[1:53:20] lack the stimulation
[1:53:23] of revelation not stimulate it anymore
[1:53:27] you don't really feel overly good
[1:53:29] anymore
[1:53:30] because you've not heard from god in so
[1:53:32] long
[1:53:33] he hasn't revealed something to you in
[1:53:36] so long
[1:53:37] if you're that like that this morning
[1:53:39] you say god
[1:53:41] i'm kind of like that this morning where
[1:53:43] i just not had a real stimulation of
[1:53:44] revelation
[1:53:45] i've not had a real good word to come
[1:53:47] from you that blessed my soul
[1:53:49] so much until i was just overjoyed
[1:53:53] i don't know it's been a long time since
[1:53:54] i felt that real
[1:53:56] peace in my heart
[1:53:59] if there's any somebody here with
[1:54:02] all his bowel would you just raise your
[1:54:04] hands to god i i haven't felt that in a
[1:54:06] while i want that lord more than
[1:54:07] anything else
[1:54:08] i need that back in my life i want that
[1:54:11] joy unspeakable
[1:54:13] and full of glory i want that with all
[1:54:16] my heart
[1:54:18] i admit i confess i don't have it lord
[1:54:20] but i know that you're here
[1:54:22] i know that you're speaking to my heart
[1:54:23] this message was for me
[1:54:26] and here i am to say god i want that joy
[1:54:28] back in my life
[1:54:30] god bless you god bless you god bless
[1:54:32] you up in the balcony god bless you
[1:54:36] be honest not with me
[1:54:39] but with him be honest he's listening
[1:54:43] and he's watching he's looking at your
[1:54:45] heart right now
[1:54:47] and he is more than willing to give you
[1:54:50] that peace in the midst of this
[1:54:53] horrible nightmarish world he wants to
[1:54:56] give you
[1:54:57] peace unspeakable joy unspeakable
[1:55:01] he wants to give you full of glory but
[1:55:04] he's telling you this morning i believe
[1:55:06] that you have to eat you have to eat
[1:55:08] more

[1:55:22] us
[1:55:22] although we don't have that joy and that
