our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and we have had a wonderful time here thus far yesterday morning got to go out and do a little uh little extracurricular activity with Brother Brad and brother Weston and we had a wonderful time and a success I told Brother Brad next time brother Thomas is going have to be a little bit more specific on what he prays for because I need a long beard not a short beard but I guess that's on me right but we had a great time we got a wonderful story behind it and it's a good memory that we made uh we bring greetings from our pastor brother Tim and the Saints there at evening like Tabernacle and want to say brother Thomas thank you for having us to come back last time it was 20 years this time's 4 months we're getting good this is great we've had a wonderful time yesterday with the Saints there at the the harb Begger family the the fellowship there was wonderful and I just want to say from the adamans family thank you for allowing us to be a part of that and putting it on it was a wonderful time certainly an honor to be here and stand before you today and we just trust something will be said that will that will bless you I'm going to do my best mention anything about Giants or anything of that nature this morning we're just going to get into the word of God and uh I do ask one thing from you can you give me one thing this morning can you give me an amen can you pull on the gift of God and you know I'm kind of like brother brandham he say you know when you goes the only skunk I know is the devil and he says I can look at my dog Fritz and say sick boy and Fritz to run in there he didn't want to run in there but he ran in there anyway and he got after him so I need y'all to say sick and boy this morning cuz this ain't my word this is his word and if you're a son and daughter of God you got a right to this word you got a right to the promise you got a right to say Amen to it you got a right to shout a right to jump a right to worship a right to praise God look now I don't see anybody here with shackles on their hands this morning amen nobody with shackles let's use those hands let's use those mouths this morning let's just go to him in prayer before we turn to the word father what a great privilege we have to stand before the elect of God and the purchase of the blood and Lord we just count it an honor to be here Lord so appreciate brother Thomas his friendship the church Lord and just what they have meant to us these last four months just forging a relationship and a friendship and Lord our desire today is that we can get ourselves out of the way and allow the gift that you placed in our hearts and our lives to operate but we know Lord your Prophet would teach us that the gift is not ours but it's the people that operates that gift so we pray Lord that the people here of the even light Tabernacle operate the gift that you placed here for it's not for me to show who I am or what I am but it's to edify and to meet the needs of those people those hands those hearts so may you do that this morning Lord may you speak expressly to us Lord however time we have set aside this morning this entire day we just give it to you and we just want your fellowship we want your worship to be pleasing our worship to be pleasing to you and and Lord may your Holy Spirit just flood every heart every life every situation every home God may you have the preeminence in this service this morning for we ask it in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles this morning we're going to look here in Exodus 3 going to also have you look in numbers 33 but we're going to look here in Exodus 3 and verse1 14 first say Amen when you get there amen and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am has sent me unto you so I want to just stop just for a minute there I know I have you standing but I want you to rec recognize who's speaking here this is not Moses speaking to himself with a you know a voice that he thinks he's hearing but no this is God the I am the self-existing one the almighty Jehovah he's come down and he said Thou shalt say unto the children of Israel I am not I was not I will be but whatever your situation is right now I am still God I'm still God of your healing I'm still God of your deliverance I'm still God of your situations I'm God of your family life I'm God of every situation I am that I am you tell them I am has sent me unto you notice Moses wasn't going just to show who Moses was Moses was going because Moses had a commission from God to go to you and I want you to see this this morning and God said moreover to Moses thou shal and thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel the Lord God of your fathers the god of Abraham and of the god of Isaac the god of Jacob has sent me unto you this is the name Forever This is my Memorial Toto all generations now notice what he tells Moses go and gather all the Elders of Israel together and say unto them the Lord God of your fathers the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob appear unto me saying I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt so God recognizes the oppression that they were under and God recognizes the oppression in which some of you are under this morning he understands where You' been he understands the trials the situations he understands those dark nights he understands those valleys that you've been in and notice and he says in verse 17 and I have said I will bring you up out of the Affliction of Egypt unto the land of the canites and the Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and with honey oh my that's a good land let's look here in numbers 33 and verse 51 speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when not if but when you are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan then ye shall drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you so God is expecting for each of us this morning to play a part in this going out of Egypt and into a new land you shall drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down their high places and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it and you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more you shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance Every Man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribes of your fathers shall you inherit God bless you you can have your seats this morning where's brother Tommy at this morning this is a beautiful Pulpit this is nice my my my this is wonderful are you glad to be a Christian this morning so I want to speak to you just for a little bit this morning footprints in the land of inheritance so Footprints we know that a prophet would teach us Footprints means possession Footprints is also an an an impression that is made in the ground how many Hunters we have here this morning how many people do we have here this morning you ever seen a footprint you say well somebody's been here before so that's what a a footprint is that shows that somebody has been here somebody has walked in this exact spot and somebody has made their impression right here see a footprint shows today that that uh that a that that somewhere that somebody has been that others can follow that they can follow those same Footprints and reach the same goal the same end product and I believe today that God is calling us to make footprints in the land of our inheritance many times we seen our forefathers our grandparents those that had the outpouring of the Holy Ghost back in' 64 and 65 but many times we put those miracles on the shelf and ask what is God doing today I'm telling you they made their footprint but what about a Believer today God has sent you a message and it's high time that we start making footprints in the land of our inheritance to show the devil that I've been here some of you need healing this morning you need to step out on it and place your foot on it and say that's belongs to me this morning healing is mine Deliverance is mine salvation is mine the Holy Ghost is mine this morning make a footprint on what belongs to you and to your family thank you notice he says in numbers 33 and 53 and you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land that word dispossess means you have to destroy means you can't play games with the devil trying to keep your Xbox and playing Call of Duty and stuff like that ain't going to get you to heaven I ain't going to say it's not going to get you there but it sure ain't going to help matters but we find here it means to destroy to bring to ruin to disinherit to take possession of so God is saying I'm taking you out of bondage I'm taking you out of Egypt but I'm taking taking you into a land a land that I promised to give to Abraham a land that I promised to give to Isaac a land that I promised to give to Jacob notice God never changed the land he gave it to Abraham it was the same promise he gave to Isaac the same promise he gave to Jacob and it's the same promise that he's given to the believer this morning he never backed up off the promise that he gave to William brandom it's the same promise today it's from to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call he's still given the same promise but somebody's got to make a footprint somebody's got to step out and say this is mine I'm tired of struggling I'm tired of fighting I'm going to take possession of it this morning it belongs to me it belongs to my family can I get a little bit more volume up here if that's okay but notice it means to destroy I know sometimes we want to be polite we're Christians right and as Christians sometimes we don't want to get our hands dirty we don't want to fight you know that's for rough people the Bible says the violent the violent taketh by force not the coward the violent that means those that are strong those that see that that belongs to me and I refuse to let the devil keep me from it that's right notice that this time God sent Moses and I'm just going to some of this is going to be Elementary for us cuz we're Believers but I'm going somewhere this morning that's right so God sent Moses with the greatest message brother Tommy of their day notice you're leaving a land of bondage I'm taking you out of Egypt what a message what if some of you've been struggling 5 years with a situation they've been 400 years 400 years of cruel oppression 400 years of seeing the young girls raped 400 young 400 years of seeing the young men not rising to much only to become a slave 400 years they were ready they knew they had a word that God was going to deliver them they were under an expectation that someday someday we're going to get out of here and we're going to go to another land we're going to have our own land we're going to have our own place we're going to have our own promises and they were looking forward to that and Moses God sent Moses with the greatest message it was not only a message of coming out of Egypt and leaving their bondage behind and leaving the the the the rulership of their taskmasters but it was a message where they had to apply the blood they had to apply the token cu the death angel sweeping through the land that's right but it was also a message that I'm not only going to take you out but I'm going to take you in see it's one thing to come out and have nowhere to go so a prophet of God came in the in the early 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s he called us out of a land of denominationalism but what if it was we didn't have anywhere to go but no we have a place to go God has taking us into the opening of the word God has taking us into the realities that he's still God he's still the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and notice this land had been designated by God when God said let us make man in our image he already knew where he was taking them come on somebody work with me this morning God already knew when God called you God already knew where he was taking you brother Tommy he knew exactly where you would be the road you would go down but he knew it right at that intersection one day you were going to meet God you were going to come in contact with this message and your life would be forever be changed why because God's got a promise and God's got a purpose and God's got a plan for each of us here this morning it's a land that's been designated for ordained by God for his chosen people there wasn't a greater Message In the Land There wasn't a greater message in the land then I'm taking you out of Egypt woo Jes come on Amen there wasn't a greater message that I'm taking you from your bondage and I'm bringing you into a land of promise I'm going to bring you into a land of liberty I'm going to bring you into a land of Freedom I'm going to bring you into a land of Victory come on all eyes on me all eyes up here I'm the preacher this morning I'm taking you to a land of promise a land of Victory a land that a Pentecostal experience whether we don't put these things on the back shelf and say God used to be he's still the I am God he's still the one that pours out his holy ghost he can still come even here this morning in our church in our service and give you a revelation that I'm calling you out of Egypt I'm calling you from that land of bondage I'm calling you from that Taskmaster and I'm taking you into a land of the Holy Ghost of a land of Victory a land of promise a land of total defeat over the enemy this morning he's calling us to that notice he's taking us to a land where we could worship oh this ain't some Baptist idea where we come to the house of God and we become a bunch of head noters no we got a right to worship God we got a right to praise God we got a right to dance in the spirit if we want to dance in the spirit we have that right because it's part of the land Noti it's a land you don't have to be afraid anymore of the Taskmaster you don't have to live in fear what they might do to you but it's a land where Sons and Daughters of God can live as Sons and Daughters of God you know but notice what they had to do they had to trust the message and they had to trust the messenger see they had to trust that the messenger heard from God come on hope you're seeing they had to trust that the messenger heard from God and they had to trust that the message was God's message not The Messengers so we find here in Exodus 3 and verse 7 I'm going to take my time this morning we're here all day right all right praise God and he said and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people come on somebody God seen your Affliction oh which are in Egypt and I have heard their Cry by the reasoning of their task Masters for I know their sorrows many times we think we're in that Valley we're in that deep pit of despair that nobody knows God doesn't even know where I met I'm all by myself am I talking to myself this morning some of you been there we feel like if we're we're all alone this is us I'm having to fight through this by myself but he says I am and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land unto a good land and a large land unto a land that's flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canites and hivites and amorites and perizzites and hivites and jebusites notice there's people already occupying the land but it didn't belong to those people it belong to you as a son and daughter of God what am I telling you this morning there's there's there's demons right now in the land of your physical body it may be cancer it may be lung trouble it may be sugar diabetes it may be lust it may be something else but that land don't belong to them it belongs to you this morning and you got a right to that land you got a right to that promise this morning and though it's already been occupied you got to dispossess the inhabitants of the land so notice he says I this is Jehovah speaking I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians then we drop down in verse 10 come now therefore and I'm going to send you Moses yeah well I thought this was God but all I see is Moses Moses was the mouthpiece of God and I'm I'm looking at two mouthpieces right here for you for the Believers here in Elton they're the mouthpiece of God for you look beyond their stature look beyond their frame look beyond their mistakes look beyond their failures and listen for the voice of them speak of God coming down and speaking to you to give you exactly what you have need of cuz he knows he says now therefore I will send thee unto pharaoh and thou mayest bring forth my children of Israel out of Egypt so we find here it wasn't Moses's message it wasn't Moses's thoughts it never was Moses's intellectual property that's see it was the message that God gave to Moses for one purpose to deliver the people did you hear me one purpose to deliver the people and our message ain't about William brandom one purpose deliver the people we're going to show that here with quotes and we're going to show it with scripture so don't freak out oh he said brother brand no no I'm saying this message was never about William brandham it was about God seeing a people that was under the cruel hand of denominationalism and God said I have come down in 1947 1948 19565 I have come down for one purpose William brandham and that's to break the Revelation that these people can be free and I'm going to take a Rapture and I'm going to Rapture people out and they're no longer going to be held by denominational bondage they're no longer going to be held by sin they're no longer be held by unbelief but I have come down in this hour in this day the same Pillar of Fire that will leading the children of Israel out of the Egypt it's the same Pillar of Fire that we see right back here and he's leading us on to the promised land into the land of our inheritance he's still God he never changes if he led them out by a pillar of fire and he was taking them to a land flowing with milk and honey you can buy God bet today that he's still doing the same thing we're not going to some oppressed land we're not going out to where he's going to leave us high and dry we're going to a good land we're going to a large land it's a land flowing with milk and honey somebody need to get their appetite L wet this morning it's a good land they say that we find milk and honey in this land and they said that was the diet of Kings not everybody can Feast on milk and honey but Kings could there subjects could in Revelations we find that he has made us both Kings and priest come on you got a right to the Honey Jar this morning stick your hand in start licking you got a right to the milk not just not just some little bit of nothing but you got a right you can drink on the word of God Feast on the word of God partake of whatever you have need of this morning for it's unto you and your children notice now the message was a message that God gave to Moses for one purpose that's to deliver the people and we find that this same Pillar of Fire brother B will tell us Moses met the angel of the Lord the angel of the Covenant otherwise he met he would tell us here and does God Chang his mind Moses was leading the children of Israel just as God would tell them where to go led by the pillar of fire you see that picture right there that ain't about a man you got to look above his head and see who that is that's taking his picture with him that wasn't to Iden yeah it was one and in one aspect to vindicate brother Bon but another way to to vindicate that he's here for us in this hour and what he did for them then he's doing for us today he's the same and he changes not he led them out of their land of and he's here to lead you out of your land bondage but notice what he says now he said led by the pillar of fire the supernatural being that was leading the way and Moses was getting his information through the logos Moses was getting his information through the logos of course that went out of God the pillar of fire which was the angel of the Covenant which was Christ the anointed one he was getting his message through there and giving it to the children of Israel on the road to the promised land so Moses never put his own interpretation to the message he stayed with what the pillar of fire said come on somebody so Moses received his message from the same angel that brother brandham received his from because there's only one Angel of the Covenant okay so notice and when he he gave the message to the to the children of Israel no longer was it Moses's message now it became their message now they had to trust the messenger they had to trust the message and when they became one with the message no longer was it just Moses now it's my message now I'm the one that's believing I believe that Moses heard from God I believe that Moses met a pillar of fire I believe that Moses met the angel of the Covenant I believe and therefore I'm going to go out on what Moses said and therefore the message is no longer in the mouth of Moses now the message is in my heart and I'm going to follow the message I'm not following the messenger per se but I'm following the message which the messenger is speaking because I know he's following the pillar of fire I hope you see the parallel between their day and our day their message and our message God never changes and notice we have been given we as a people have been given the greatest message in all the world see and the message was never about Moses what kind of leader could he be it never was about how great he was or how great he esteemed to be the message was for Moses to go and call out a people always go and deliver my people you believe that this morning see the message was God was going to take a people out out of Egypt but he was going to take him into a land flowing with milk and honey he was going to take him from bondage of sin the bondage of man-made Creeds and ideas and dogmas and he was going to take them into the land of the opening of the word where the same signs that followed on the day of Pentecost that came down is the same God the same signs the same wonders the same Supernatural That's fallen in our day just because a prophet is gone doesn't mean that the angel of the Covenant is gone he's still here the Holy Ghost is still here how many how many of you got the Holy Ghost today how many of you are under the age of 50 years old today that means that the Holy Ghost the same one that was with brother brandom the same one that had his picture taken was with you when you received the Holy Ghost if he would have left you would have never received it but he goes to show that he's still here he's still calling he's still moving he's still filling with the Holy Ghost he is still God and he's leading a people to a land notice he's taken them to a land where all the loose sins of the previous ages has all been tied together for all the mysteries of God had now been revealed so we're not looking for Moses to come back when Moses went beyond the curtain of time when it was time for him to go God anointed another servant a Joshua and the same commission that Moses had Joshua had yeah now take them Joshua you're going to divide the land for him and hold brother B taught us that our Joshua is the Holy Ghost he had to leave so the Holy Ghost could be poured out upon us and notice we can only receive the Holy Ghost in our day through the ministry of Malachi 4 through an end time message cuz when is it applied when do you apply the token in the evening time not in the morning time not in the midday day time of the message but in the evening time all the loose sins now been finalized all the mysteries of God had been revealed and notice we're going to a land of Supernatural freedom and liberty a land where all things are possible for the believer oh come on believer but we must trust the message and we must trust the messenger see we don't have to try to figure it all out you can find Brothers today men today that preach this message and they try to make I mean my goodness they got the cow eating GRE grass up in the top of a tree and we mean we got them all mixed up they got their types and shadows all wrong just don't try to figure it out just stay with it maybe you're not called to put the cow in the top of the tree but just called at least put the cow in the grass and let them Forge around a little bit and eat what he can eat stay with the word stay with what you know don't try to be some great teacher when you're not a teacher I learned that lesson I tried to teach the Holy Ghost series to our young people years ago brother Thomas man I sat down I was like I better sit down because I know what kind of preacher I am I'm about halfway through it I'm like I can't do this guys I jumped up and I mean I preached the Holy Ghost them we did like several months of the Holy Ghost and man we had just an outpouring of the spirit of God on our young people you know and you just got to know what God's called you for so just stay in it but notice brother Brandon would tell us in the message of Shame he goes I close my eyes I just let the Bible fall open I put my finger on the scripture Genesis 24:7 elas or Abra Abraham's faithful servant the model servant of the Bible being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac and he said that's right with the rest of my message pulling out the bride so he had a message of Divine Healing but this part of it stayed right with his message he knew what he was sent for and that was to call out a bride for our Lord and he would talk about elizar he said he he went straight right out and began praying and he met the beautiful Rebecca that became the Bride of Isaac just a perfect message back to the word go get that bride he says that's a duty that's what I'm here for that's what I'm trying to do is call out AB bride he never was about building a kingdom to himself he never was about people baptizing in his name he never was about people falling down and worshiping him he was about finding that elect for almighty God call falling out the and that's why you're here this morning is because you didn't hear just the voice of William bradam you heard the voice behind the voice that one that spoke to him you heard that same Pillar of Fire say come out of her my people and be not be not yoked up in her bondage notice he didn't come to build his own kingdom draw man to himself but he come to get a bride and that's what every God call man's purpose is or should be so when you find men building kingdoms you know they ain't of God oh they can be under the umbrella of the message they can be they can have signs and wonders and Supernatural this that and the other but if they're drawing men to themselves that's a seed of discrepancy because we got one purpose one plan and that's to fill the Great Commission and call out an elect call out a bride for Jesus Christ brother Thomas how long you been here 30 years 32 years I don't see no Kingdom yet that's right because it ain't about Thomas Bor it's not about Brad pow it's not about Joe Adams Tim pu Donnie Reagan Ed Bisal put whoever you want there it ain't about us it's about you this morning oh come on I don't think that fell flat it's about you this morning the message has always been about you it's been about a pride it's been about an elect God his own Focus it's always been about I want a wife I want Fellowship I want someone that can reciprocate my love so God sent a messenger in it's end time for you notice what he says in the breach he goes we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's been probed at through six Church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all the loose sins that these Fells probed it and the Mysteries come down from God as the word of God reveals the entire revelation of God so God sent a messenger to reveal the entire Revelation but you know what we try to complicate the Revelation the Revelation the entire Revelation is about you go listen to Christ the mystery of God revealed right after he opened the Seven Seals after he preached it was all about you all that God was he poured it in the Christ and all that Christ was he pours it into a bride or poured it into a people so that you and him can be the same so that he could come back in one day he's going to Rapture of people that's going to be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life she is him this ain't stuff we just teach this ain't stuff that we just fill your head with a bunch of head knowledge this is the reality that God is still here God is still moving God is still filling heart God is changing the people God changes drug drug addicts alcoholics and make some Sons and Daughters of God cuz before the foundation God deposited something there notice let me keep going here he says at the sounding of the seventh Church age how many believe we're in the seventh Church age at the seventh Church age all the loose sins that through these AE Church ages have been probed it will be wound up together and I'm going to put this out there if there is still a loose in we have an imperfect message if there is still a mystery that has not been revealed we have an imperfect message because he was sent to reveal the entire revelation of God to a people so you got to look at the word you got to look at the message that were preached and you got to find yourself in The Invisible Union got to find yourself in modern events made clear through prophecy you got to find yourself in leadership cuz only the bride's going to follow the pillar of fire cuz the others can't follow that it's too hard so notice what he says now and when the seals are broke and the Mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting one foot on the land and one on the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is on the earth at the time of his coming so we know who the seventh angel is the seventh messenger that obviously is brother brandom but we find it wasn't brother br's message Christ came down and Christ put his foot on the land and put his foot on the sea he was declaring di minion over the Earth at that time saying that he was coming back and we were going to occupy this Earth there's going to be a people that's going to take possession of it come on Church excuse me now he said talk about a jubilee talk about a time when the lamb walked forth the book even sealed in heaven the Mysteries are and you say is my name there he goes I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put there before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that Redemption came a lamb and he had T been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book Glory he opened the book he tore the seals off and sent it down to earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to the people This Book used to be closed come on somebody this book used to be closed but Christ came down and he what did he do he took the book when John looked and said no man was found worthy to take the book or even look at the book oh the elders said weep not John the lion of the tribe of Judah he had prevailed and John turned to find a lion and he saw a lamb a lamb that have been slain he was slain on your behalf he was slain on your benefit he was slain so you wouldn't have to be SL and he prevailed and he took the book oh Hallelujah he didn't just take it to leave it in his possession but he ripped the seals off of it and he handed it down to the messenger and he said reveal it to the people reveal this mystery to the people so they will know that they are the elect of God thank so God revealed the entire mysteries of God but he gave it to a messenger remember when brother BR was about to preach the first seal I would have made a horrible mistake I would have made I would have made a horrible mistake but he came in the room woo that's what we want this morning we don't want to hear from a man we don't want to hear from a man we wanted him to come in the room we want him to come to the house of God we want him to come and break the bread of life notice he opened the book and tore the seals off and sent it down to earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people it's always been about the people the mystery the purpose the plan was to bring the people out of bondage go see that's that that's the message of the seventh angel never was about him well you can go play and it's all about him cuz all they hear is the voice of William brandom they don't hear the voice behind that they don't see the one that met him in the cave they don't hear the one that spoke to him and tore the seals off and met him in the closet met him in the room when he brought those Revelations of those Seven Seals he met the angel of the Covenant cuz it was to wind up all the loose sins so that you could have confidence in the message yeah come on somebody so that you you young people so that you young people could have confidence in the message and it no longer be just Mom and Dad's message or Mom and Dad's belief or just the preachers belief or just the deacons and trustees and whoever else the officials in the church are these Great Men no look you can go to a youth camp and you can meet the same Pillar of Fire that your mom and dad had met years ago why because it ain't about the man it ain't about the messenger it's always about the message to the people and if you can believe that God sent you a message you can walk out this morning you can walk out different then you walked in you can walk out free you can walk out healed you can walk out filled with the Holy Ghost you can walk out this morning a change Man by putting a footprint into your inheritance and that's what God is expecting us to he's want to see young men have a real experience of the Holy Ghost don't just go through the motions I believe God sent Prophet well big deal the devil does too so you equal with the devil no he wants you to have an experience so when those Dark Hours come so when those lonely days come so when you're being pushed and tried by the enemy you can make a footprint that this is mine Satan this don't belong to you Satan this is my promise this is my inheritance it belongs to me this morning somebody make a footprint make an impression on the word of God that somebody else can watch you somebody else can watch your life say I want to follow those steps I know where they're leading I know where he came from I seen him in the bar I seen him in that life I seen what he used to be but I'm watching his Footprints I see where they're leading him come on somebody notice the seventh angel was making known the promise to the Overcomer he was leading them he's leading us into our inheritance okay it's more than just going to church like I said or believing God sent a prophet but it's believing that the message and the messenger you know there there's people that take that quote that the messenger and the message are one and they claim that the message brother Brams but he clearly states over and over and over and over and over that it never was his message he was receiving it from the angel of the Lord and one purpose to call out a bride we find here in Exodus 3 and verse 17 notice now he says I have said this is God speaking not Moses I will bring you up out of the Affliction of Egypt unto a land of the canites Hittites amorites perizzites hivites jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey so we found that God God promised to people a designated land and today that land is being bombed by Iran it's being persecuted by all those over in Asia right now she's a burdensome Stone but yet it's a land that God chose God predestinated them to dwell in that land and God had promised you to dwell in this land see the opening of the book is not for everybody to the Baptist it's still closed to the Pentecost it's still closed to the Presbyterians it's still closed and to many message Believers it's still closed but to the bride to the elect it's an open book how many of you ever had a real difficult test in high school maybe some of y'all didn't go to high school in Kentucky I don't know I didn't get very many hands go up okay how many let's do this again I'm G to speak real slow how many have ever had a hard test that's much better I know I speak too fast of what it was you had a hard test and you were Fred all night about that test you try to cram and try to refra I mean r to retrain all the information but you get to school the next day and the teacher says all right kids it's open book W Glory I ain't got to wor about me in my ability to try to remember everything it's an open book all I got to do is start flipping through the pages start looking at at the chapters start looking at where this was and where that what am I telling you this morning I'm telling you it's an open book this morning you ain't got to worry about your ability it's already been loosed it's already been open he's already revealed it to you just start looking through the book start looking through the chapters every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line oh it's Glory toide Church it belongs to you and it's open this morning so this is a land that God has selected for a special class of people this book ain't for everybody now the Bible yes but the open book became a new book came a different book because now the Revelation came that which is been hidden through seven Church ages had now been revealed because God sent a message to give it to you so when you read your Bible I hope you don't think you're reading the same way the Baptist read it the same way the Pentecost to read it no you're reading it with a whole new set of eyes with the eyes of vindication eyes of the pillar of fire because why because God has revealed the understanding of this book to you a special Hey Brother Brown we call a prophetic class of people a prophetic come on somebody I know we in Kentucky but prophetic is a pretty powerful word and that's how your Prophet described you you are a prophetic class of people not just an ordinary people not just a church goer not just somebody's going to occupy of you but you are a prophetic class of people God knew of your coming he prophesied of your coming and he sent a word to capture your heart to turn you back to the faith of the fathers good so to the present day believer our promised land is the open Word of God our promised land is the Holy Ghost and what is the Holy Ghost it's a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you so it's not just the Holy Ghost that's you know God used to be above them walking you know being above them then he came down and he walked with them but now in this day in this age is the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ in us so we find it's Jesus Christ the land of our inheritance church is that God is trying to take a people and fill them with his spirit so that he can Rapture them out of here and take us to a literal land but notice God's Prophet led us out of denominational bondage into the opening of the word it's no longer a sealed book the people we are the people of the open book we are the people of the revealed word we are the people that can live and manifest every promise in this Bible nobody can do that but you come on the Bible says that all things are possible for them that are believe that's all you got to do is believe this morning notice a people that can live and manifest a full word of God both mechanics and and Dynamics signs and wonders you said well brother Joe we're taught we're not supposed to seek after signs and wonders no you're not but if you're a bonafied Believer signs of Wonders are going to identify that you are a son and daughter of God you not maybe not be seeking after you but you can't help it because you believe and they follow those that believe it's an identification that you are a son and daughter of God and so God is taking us into the land of signs and wonders where cancer can can be defeated where Miracles can take place where demon Spirits can be cast out that's the land that we're going to church a land where the supernatural we poured out in our lives in our homes in our churches and it's a land that's already been searched out by God so God knew in Elton Kentucky a little bitty small town in the middle of a bunch of fields where to put a church some of y'all need to say Amen to that otherwise you wouldn't have nowhere to go but God knew where to put a church cuz he knew there would be a people that would drive an hour and a half two hours some drive whatever to be here so they can hear the atmosphere they can see the change they can see when the power of God drops down all the things that they're battling the pressures of life that they're going through begin to lift off of them and we can have a supernatural outpouring of the Holy Ghost because it's a supernatural land that God has taken us into and it's already been searched out and that's why Satan fights us so hard brother Thomas he doesn't want you to make a footprint into that land cuz when you make a footprint and show that you possess that land you possess that promise you possess that healing brother Tommy you possess your young people brother John you possess your young people let me tell you when you put your foot on that Satan knows right then that you mean business and he's going to fight you to keep you from that he don't want you to occupy the promise he don't want you to come into the Revelation that yet that land is yours that you are in fact on the right track nor does he want anybody to follow your steps that's why we got to make a footprint I want my kids my kids I want them to know I made a foot footprint I walked away from family Dynamics family strands I broke the cycle I made a footprint we're not going to live like that anymore oh I used to be a drunker I used to party I used to do all that but I made a footprint for this word I don't want to live like that I don't want to show my kids that kind of life I'm going to make a footprint that I'm going to be a Son of God I'm going to raise him in the atmosphere of God I'm going to raise him in the house of God I'm going to raise him where the Holy Ghost can come down we making Footprints this morning footprints in the land of our [Applause] inheritance you know some of you may find family say you too good for us no but I'm I'm better than that I'm better than you drinking I'm better than you drunking I'm better than you sleeping around I'm better than you blasphemy I'm better than that I ain't saying I'm better than you I'm saying I'm better than that which you do do notice now let me keep going brother B say after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of a living God you heard from your theophany oh my you heard from your theophany man that's your spiritual body oh man you you're not hearing from a man oh you're hearing from your theophany notice but the land brother Joe you just don't understand there's jebusites there there's hivites there oh come on man up weak sauce God called us to fight how many fighters I got in here how many fighters I got in here this morning that's it God's called us to F you say well you know brother Joe God's not to fight oh I'll take you wrong Bible say he's a man of war he's a man of war he knows what it means to go in and do battle he knows what it means to go in and be a conqueror and I'm telling you he said you're are more than conquerors why because he's gone before you and if God be for you who can be against you this morning if God be for your family who a devil in hell can be against your if God be for your church brother thas what devil can come in here and try to take out the atmosphere of God God is for us church God is taking us Church he's leading us into a land of promise but here they say you got to drive out well brother Jo I'm tired this morning well go drink your monster or Red Bull or whatever kind of energy fix you get I don't care but I'm going tell you what this word should excite you it should stimulate you you know you think about a a prophet of God stimulation from Revelation this stimulates me man I'm seeing where I come from I'm seeing where I'm going I'm seen in that old life that never was me that was just some some devil trying to put that on me to steer me away but oh at the right time I come into the right Junction I came into the right intersection and Bam the Holy Ghost met me there and I heard from my theophany I heard that egole scream he called me into a higher place he called me into an atmosphere he called me to a land of promise of inheritance it's all about God calling you this morning you can't go pitch fork this messes on somebody else and say it ain't for me it is for you thank you Lord numbers 33:52 then you shall drive out the inhabitants of the land and destroy all their pictures destroy all their mol image quite pluck down their high places and you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein yeah so you got something to do then he says I've given you the land to possess it so God made you a promise I've given you the Revelation sometimes we think well the Revelation is going to come easy man we're going to be in our prayer closet and off sudden woo the angel of God's going to meet with us hey that does happen but some of you going to have to fight in every church service to get what little bit of Revelation you can get and when you get it you going to have to fight to retain it cuz that Satan's going to put you through hell the next week Monday is going to be hell popping Monday he's going to try to hit you with every kind of adversity he can hit you with but you got to know you made footprint on Sunday let me tell you and you don't stop just on Sunday and Wednesday you make another one on Monday and another one on Tuesday and you keep making footprint and you keep following the angel of the Covenant cuz he's taking you to a land of promise but we find we get to the land there's squatters on the land the prophet of God will tell us our Kinsman handed a seven seal book of redemption from the original owner the original owner when he lost it in the Garden of Eden through Adam he went back to the original owner but there's been a poacher on the land a squatter and that's Satan and he's come over and he's a poacher this Earth don't belong to him W somebody say that this morning this Earth don't belong to you Satan it belongs to me I got a right to this land I got a right to this I got a right to Healing I got a right to Deliverance I got a right to a restored home I got a right to a restor me I got a right to it it don't belong to you you poacher he said this Earth don't belong to him it belongs to God but he's a poacher a squatter see and he would say he broke he break the seals and reveals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming the kinsman redeemer and he freely gives it out to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed it but instead of keeping it to himself he gives it back to the people my what a redeemer what a redeemer he gave the book back to us here in the message Revelation chapter 5 part two he was tell her I love this he said in the Old Testament a man lost his inheritance and a squatter come on the land and he could not hold it any longer for annihilation from the from the for for the owner for until 50 years and after the 50 years the Year of Jubilee came and the Year of Jubilee when the Year of Jubilee come along then everything went back to its original beginning again all slaves went back to the original beginning and if a man was hoing in a field and a trumpet sounded and he heard it he could throw the hole down and say I'm no longer a slave I can go back home to my family everything was given back if a squatter was on the ground he had to get off the ground that's all he got off the ground why because the legal owner was coming back let me tell you the legal owner is coming back church we own this land it belongs to us got designated through us and if you got sickness in your body this morning you need to tell that old squatter the original owner is coming back today I'm taking my healing I'm taking everything back from that devil that stole it from me some of you need to rise and go down to the enemy's house this morning A lot of times we want the preacher to go down there for us go preacher go preacher call the preacher no you've been anointed you've been elected you've been chosen by God you've been called to go down there shall we sit here until we die no sir if a leper can get up and go get it why can't we if a leper with no Revelation can get up and go down there and occupy and face the Army what about us today we got a promise in the word no weapon no weapon formed against me no weapon formed against my family no weapon formed against my wife no weapon formed against my husband no weapon formed against my preacher no weapon formed against my church no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise up against the thou shall condem that's a promise so we got to go take possession Church kick the squatters off the land let me see how long I've been woo I've been a while see if we're Sons and Daughters of God today and God has promised us the land to inherit it and this got people already occupied God knew those people were going to be there he knew some of you would face sicknesses he knew some of you were going to face challenges he knew some of you would face very dire situations some of those jebusites and amorites and hivites and whatever some of those were a little bit stronger Devils than some of the other ones but nevertheless God gave them the land go down there and drive them out that's why we come to the house of God is to get reinforcement to allow your faith to rise up so that you can do exactly that notice and it would tell us in verse 55 if we will not drive out the inhabitants of the land then there shall be Pricks in your eyes and thorns in your side and they shall Vex you while you're in the land so God's not calling us to live with the inhabitants yeah you know how many of you are sick this morning okay nobody praise God I mean we got old people here and they ain't even sick come on old people you can laugh at that it's okay but I mean if God's entitled us he he he doesn't expect us to live in sickness and live in sin and live with diseases and live with spirits of unbelief and complexes and family stange no he want you to dispossess the inhabitants of the land see brother Brown would tell us and the angel of the Covenant he said he's give you healing it's your possession it's all he says it's all bound down with amorites and Canaanites and everything else of unbelief but go in take it over it's yours it belongs to you he said that's right I must fight if I should reain increase my courage Lord this is not a picnic ground this is a battlefield so footsteps means possession they had to fight for every inch of ground that they took that's right fighting and take every he said fight every inch but he said everywhere The Souls of your foot lands that's possession Footprints or footsteps is possession he said that's the same thing it is today Divine Healing belongs to you the Holy Spirit belongs to you it's our property but you'll fight for every inch of it yes sir he says but brother foot steps is possession just keep fighting take it the devil say the days is Miracle is passed you say you're lying God said he's the same yesterday today and forever take it over quit listening to the LIE of your adversary and listen to the voice of the angel of God God told Israel I've given you the land of palestin he goes he could have went up there and excommunicated the whole thing run them all out with a plague killed all all of them he could have went up there and sit fear among them and drove them all out of the country but he said Israel it's yours little bride it's yours see it's yours you got to go get it they had to fight for every inch of ground that they stood on and every promise in the book of The Great Shepherd is to the Sheep but brother he will never come down and drive it away for you you got to fight for every inch of promise but it yours come on I hope you're hearing that this morning but it's yours it belongs to you this morning oh Hallelujah notice the land of the word belongs to you you're not just here going you got to be here to be more than just persevering you got to fight and Satan's going to do everything he can to keep the Revelation from you you're going to have to fight through traditions of man you're going to have to fight through man-made ideas you know you're going to have to fight through what you know to hear the voice of God and the spirit moving in the house of God and notice when God was taking them into this land they were a wondering people they wandered 40 years in the desert because of their unbelief I ask you this morning how long are we going to keep going around that same proverbial Mountain how long are we going to keep kicking the can down the road waiting for this great service or that great service or my favorite preacher of this super anointing to come when are we going to go in they were three days journey from the land three days journey from the land they can look over brother Thomas the Propet was say they can look over and they can see every promise in the land but their unbelief kept them from occupying the promise their unbelief kept them they could see brother Tommy somebody else be delivered of cancer but what about me he's still God he never said just encamp about the mountain he said I've given you the land I've given you the land notice so we find that when that promised land was a land of their rest that they could cease from wandering around the desert they could cease from going around the mountain they could cease from making it all their efforts and all that hardship and all that now when they entered into that Promised Land it was land of rest in the Hebrews chapter 4 brother br will tell us what is the rest when did the rest come when the people spoke with tongues and had stammer lips and stammer lips he says that didn't they didn't speak nothing they stammered but when did it happen on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost come that is the rest the Holy Ghost Jesus says come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy late and I will give you rest it's where you cease from your own worldly ideas and your own worldly ambition and you're on worldly efforts and you rest in the promised land of God so church I'll just tell you just because you speak in tongues don't mean it's it I'm going to share something with you right now that happened to us Wednesday night at our home church and I ain't going to go into all the details because it's pretty graphic but we had a young lady in our church she was invited by another sister of our church she works with her at a school and this young girl's 21 years old got four children ages probably what you say say nine to infant six to infant six to infancy she come up for prayer at the end of the service crying out to God wanting Deliverance so we all the ministry team knelt down and we begin to pray for brother Thomas and when she looked up she looked into my eyes and I'm like a I done seen this before I mean I looked into the eyes of a demon and she said I have made agreeance with this Spirit she says I have a spirit of divination I've been given discernment I have large discernment so this spirit that has occupied she says they're Legion they're many their Legion but she's wanting she's wanting freedom from this or these spirits and here she is we would begin to pray and and we would pray a little bit and you seem like a little bit of relief but then she's back you look in those eyes again and you see the same thing like this girl's not delivered this girl's not delivered this girl so we took her to a side room the ministry Cham and we had a sister come in there with us and we begin to deal with her and not just pray but brother Tim be to talk to her and she through this course of time she says I just became a Christian a year ago began to read my Bible and she just got out of the insane institution two weeks prior she said I was reading my Bible and I walked through there and it gave me a spirit of speaking in tongues and she said I could speak in Chinese and Bam she began to speak in fluid Chinese don't tell me that because you got the you can speak in tongues but you got the holy ghost that devil can speak in any language that we can speak in and this girl she worshiped that thing because it gave her power it gave her Credence it gave her purpose she could speak in tongu she could have discernment so she thought she had discernment brother Tim looked at her and said that's a lion Spirit that's a devil you don't have that's not from God so the devil has tricked her in thinking that everything that she'd received came from God because he impersonated the gifts of God now this young lady worshiped it so when you worship that Spirit you don't get delivered of it right so we did by the grace of God her countenance did change but she walked out she was still bound as bound as she was when she walked in but there is a desire for deliverance so I say all that to say this just because you can speak in tongues that's not rest you got to know that your heart has been changed your Nature has been changed your desires had been changed that you had a real experience with God and not just because you can feel the Goosebumps or you can feel the emotion and you can shout in a church service that ain't about it Satan can shout he can speak in tongu he can dance in the Spirit he can do all that but he can't live the life what am I telling you he can't live he can't put a footprint on the promise but you can this morning you can step out there with a change life and say this is my land of inheritance let me go on a little bit further brother Brown says there's three stages of the journey it typed J he said now there's the first stage was leaving Egypt the second stage was the Wilderness and the third third stage was Canaan and he said Canan does not represent the age of the Millennium it only represents the age excuse me of the Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming in Revelations 21:7 says he that overcometh shall inherit all things how many of you Overcomers this morning all right so we're living in the age brother Thomas of the final Overcomer I'm the final fin Overcomer there's not another age promise there's not another messenger promise I am the final Overcomer so notice the land here brother B says now what is the land promised to the New Testament believer he said the promise is the Holy Ghost so there's three stages of the journey and numbers 33 and verse 54 we're going to start driving this home driving it I'm about to start I'm going to start Landing this airplane been flying is that all right I know brother J for y'all used to have him he'd parachute out there's times I parachuted out last weekend that brother said brother Joe why didn't you pray for anybody like man I was sick and tired I was done sometimes you just got to be a preacher right to understand it but we find I want to go down this road just as we begin to close because we're looking at footprints in the land of inheritance so what is an inheritance let's go here and it says you shall de abide The Land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more you shall give the more and to the fewer you shall give to fewer but every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot follow so every believer has an inheritance you that have great faith there's going to be a little bit more land for you because you have faith to occupy the land how many of you are familiar with the prayer of jabz increase my borders enlarge my Coast see JZ wasn't just settling for just one Revelation Jaz wanted everything that God had for him he was going into that land he said Lord enlarge my Coast Lord enlarge my borders and that should be the prayer of every believer this morning God increase my understanding increase my Revelation Lord I'm going into that land of promise I want all that you have for me I want everything in the land I want the contents in the land from border to border I Want It All anything outside the Border but I'm not worried about that but I want what pertains to me as an overcomer believer this hour so we find you shall divide the land by lot then we look here but it wasn't so from the beginning and and this is paragraph 20 brother B says we Noti on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit returned the pillar of fire just separated itself in tongues of Fire sat upon each of them they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak in tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now tongues licks of fire sat upon each of them what was it God dividing himself the spirit where he had Jesus with it without measure now we have it by measure but it's the same spirit so we find here in numbers 33 you shall divide the land their inheritance and then on the day of Pentecost God the pillar of Fire that came from the logos begin to divide itself it begin to divide itself and say this is the land I'm giving you the portion that belongs to you this morning and when you got the Holy Ghost Church it means you got eternal life it means you got everything that God has it means that we're join a with Jesus Christ all that he had we had all that belonged to him belongs to us he had it without measure we got it with measure but the land was being divided up oh that's beautiful so the pillar of fire that came from the logos divided itself up and what he did that day he's the same today he showing that the land of promise to the believer is the Holy Ghost notice you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance this word inheritance Adriana what's it mean I told you I get the last say notice now this word inheritant means to receive an irrevocable gift oh I don't think y'all heard that maybe you don't know what irrevocable means I'm glad you asked cuz I'm going to tell it to you an irrevocable able gift with an emphasis of a special relationship between the benefactor and the recipient so this word irrevocable means it can't be revoked it can't be recalled unable to be repealed not able to be an knowed not able to be altered so what am I telling you when God gives you the Holy Ghost it can't be recalled it can't be aled it can't be separated he ain't going to call it back it's an irrevocable gift based on a special relationship oh Hallelujah somebody should speak in tongues right now irrevocable gift that God has given to you Church it means the third pool is your promise the open word is your promise faith is your promise healing is your promise Deliverance is your promise your marriage is your promise your children are your promise everything you have need of is your promise this morning it means there's going to be a people brother Thomas in the land that's going to operate under a super anointing yeah listen what he says in the super sign he said they say the days of Miracles has passed he says all these things let them prove it he goes I'll give you an everlasting sign a super sign oh yes now he could have come with an angel he could have come whatever he wished to but he chose to come as Abraham's seed amen Abraham supersede that's right the way he chose to come to show in this last days God's Super Signs a super race oh yes not what you call a super race but what God calls a super race because they got what Supernatural power with Supernatural SS through a supernatural belief in a supernatural word from a supernatural God he says amen you talk about super woo come on somebody and this is your god telling you that you got it you got a super sign a super anointing a super belief with a super word by oh Hallelujah by a supernatural God a supernatural God in a supernatural body in a supernatural people giving Supernatural signs well God ain't doing nothing in my church open your eyes he is doing something he's here this morning and somebody is making a footprint on the promise of God don't tell me God ain't doing nothing you should have been at our youth camp God did something God's still doing something Hallelujah you say well I bought a piece of ground brother Joe

quiet I got to make the right Footprints well we come to the house of God we don't expect God's unfolded this word to us listen what the brother what the prophet of God says he goes you got an abstract title deed there's nothing can put you off of it man they hand you a land to the Martin Homestead man they got barns they got a house they got property they got a they got a kazeebo they got all kinds of stuff out there have y'all been out there drive out there today yeah and lust after like I did like oo okay maybe that's the wrong word don't lust after it just so I wish I could inherit this y'all wouldn't be looking at me like you looking at me right now like oh yeah now youd be excited you'd be so excited oh man that great uncle Odell he done left you to land Odell you know he's

Adams man y'all GNA hear me shout from Louisiana what am I trying to tell you I'm trying to draw you a picture God is giving you a land let me tell you home Martin Hol theread can't put a print on this land it can't put a it can't put an allegory right there it's a good land it's a large land it's a land Flo with milk and honey and he said You shall inherit the land and he's giving you an abstract trial de he said there's nothing can put you off of it look everything that's on the ground belongs to you and when you're in Christ Jesus by the baptism of the Holy Ghost every gift of God belongs in the church it's an abstract title deed it's yours it belongs to you it quickens your mortal bodies so what does an abstract means means everything against that piece of property has been stricken off everything that Mama was Daddy was they may have been alcoholics prostitutes it don't matter it searched all the way back to the origin and it is stricken off there's nothing that can keep you from the promise there's not a devil big enough there's not a tormenting Spirit strong enough as far as the boundaries of the land goes it's yours you believe that let me go on just a little bit further and I promise I'm going to start winding this down he said let the devil say you don't you don't do it he said that old nasty Porter at the door don't you believe in that walk right in there it's yours you got a pass you got an abstract Deed on the place if sickness dwells there you got an abstract deed if you went home tonight and there was an enemy sitting in your house that enemy said now wait a minute this house is built for human beings it's just as much mine as it is yours but no you got an abstract to your house he said you can go down there to the authorities and you can get that Abstract title deed and you can come back and they won't get out he said you can call the law enforcement and they will put them out what am I telling you this morning God is giving you an abstract title de to the land of promise and if that devil that squatter won't leave you got the Holy Ghost this morning you can call him up and he's got to leave he can't stay because you got a deed to the land you got a deed to the promised land he says when you're saved God gives you a checkbook at the bottom of it Jesus name a sign on every check any Redemptive blessing belongs to you are you afraid to fill it out I tell you what none of you better give me a checkbook I'm an accountant I'll show you how to write out a check you better hope you got enough money in it I'm like go big or go

Christ if so be that you suffer with him that you may also be glorified with him and brother B would tell us in Hebrews chapter 6 he said now being dead in Christ according to the scriptures we take on Abraham see are heirs according to the promise not by joining a church or forming dead articles but by being born of the spirit of Christ we are Abraham's seed and join HS with him in the Kingdom he says we won't be Sons but we are now sons of God and heirs and Joint HS with Christ everything that Jesus died for at Calvary is your possession everything is your possession he said if you're Abraham's seed you believe everything that God said he was wounded for my transgressions with his stripes I'm Healed I'm heir to that well these blessings that God promised he says I'm heir to it he said that's my possession when God Saves a man he gives him a whole checkbook at the bottom it's everything the name of Jesus Christ is wrote on it at the bottom of the checkbook whatever you ask in my name that will I do Abraham see believes that just fill out the check and send it in the deposit is already made it's in the bank oh Hallelujah this I said it's in the bank this morning you got a neede he can supply that neede just sign the name sign it out fill the check out this morning he told Abraham Abraham look East look West look as far as you can see everything is yours come on Abraham seed somebody you need to look East look West it all belongs to you he's willed it to you he's given it to you you're an inheritance of it he says so when he stepped out on God's promise watch what happened Abraham oh my listen to it Abraham look just as far as you can look just as far as east north south it's all yours he said now Abraham he said don't just stand there and look at it walk through it sometimes we can just look at the preacher but he's saying walk through it come on make Footprints into the land of your inheritance he said walk through it notice now as I bringing this

bit too high well get on your knees and climb Jacob's Ladder and believe forth this morning and if you can't have enough Faith get on dou brother Thomas's back and climb a little higher and then they
