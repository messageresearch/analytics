[33:17] that'll make you happy to be a christian
[33:22] when you think of the alternative so
[33:24] uh let's turn with me if you would until
[33:26] your bible's into matthew 6.
[33:31] i'll read a portion of scripture there
[33:33] we're gonna we're trying a new
[33:34] microphone tonight so if this thing
[33:36] messes up or it's it's not good it's
[33:39] it's not brother micah's fault it's it's
[33:41] my fault so
[33:44] seeing that song fill my cup how many
[33:46] wants a feeling of christ tonight
[33:49] a true dedication and commitment and
[33:52] feeling of christ i i tell you it's been
[33:54] on my my mind there and i had a it
[33:57] seemed like a million thoughts coming at
[33:59] me here and i feel like i've got about
[34:01] four sermons combined into one so bear
[34:03] with me i i won't keep you long i don't
[34:06] think maybe 30 40 minutes tonight i know
[34:08] you're hot you're tired you've probably
[34:10] had supper and and you're ready to take
[34:12] a nap or go to sleep for tomorrow so the
[34:14] heat really takes it out of you but bear
[34:17] with us and let's just dedicate a few
[34:18] minutes if we could to hear what the
[34:20] lord has in store for us
[34:22] matthew chapter 6 we'll go to verse 5
[34:24] and 13.
[34:26] and when thou prayest
[34:28] thou shall not be as the hypocrites are
[34:31] for they love to pray standing in the
[34:32] synagogues and in the corners of the
[34:34] streets that they may be seen of men
[34:37] verily i say unto you they have their
[34:40] reward
[34:41] but thou when thou prayest enter into
[34:43] thy closet and when thou has shut thy
[34:45] door pray to thy father which is in
[34:47] secret
[34:48] and thy father which seeth in secret
[34:50] shall reward thee openly
[34:53] but when ye pray use not vain rep
[34:55] the heathens do for they think that they
[34:57] shall be heard for their much speaking
[35:00] be not ye therefore like unto them for
[35:03] your father knoweth what things you have
[35:05] need of before you ask them isn't that a
[35:07] nice statement right there he knows what
[35:09] you need before you even ask
[35:11] how much of a greater father could there
[35:13] be
[35:15] so after this manner therefore pray ye
[35:17] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[35:19] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[35:22] done
[35:23] in earth as it is in heaven give us this
[35:26] day our daily bread and forgive us our
[35:27] death as we forgive our debtors
[35:30] lead us not into temptation but deliver
[35:32] us from evil for thine is the kingdom
[35:34] and the power and the
[35:36] glory forever amen let's pray heavenly
[35:39] father we just come before you tonight
[35:41] with humble hearts lord and we just
[35:42] asked lord jesus as we've read the
[35:44] scripture
[35:45] we could call the completion of the
[35:46] service now knowing we've read your word
[35:49] father and we've heard from you but lord
[35:51] jesus we just ask that that you would be
[35:53] with us for the next few moments that
[35:55] you would come down and speak to our
[35:56] hearts that you would move me out of the
[35:58] way that we could minister the word as
[36:00] you've laid it upon my heart lord jesus
[36:02] to encourage and inspire and draw us
[36:04] closer to you father we're no doubt
[36:06] living in a late hour and we just want
[36:09] more of you father and we want to be
[36:11] closer to you and more committed in our
[36:13] daily walk with you we just want to tell
[36:15] you we love you and appreciate you in
[36:17] jesus name we pray amen amen you have
[36:20] your seats
[36:22] is this is this volume okay it sounds
[36:25] different to me i don't know what it
[36:26] sounds like to you
[36:28] all right we're gonna go
[36:31] good to have ellie with us
[36:34] i'll title my message tonight if we
[36:35] could
[36:36] life with an intimate god life with an
[36:38] intimate god
[36:40] and we look at this little portion of
[36:42] scripture here and it's it's a portion
[36:43] of scripture that i just love we've
[36:45] heard it most of our lives uh and we
[36:47] should know it by heart and in this
[36:48] scripture here jesus
[36:50] uh
[36:51] jesus is explaining to the disciples on
[36:53] how to pray
[36:55] and when we look at this it's basically
[36:57] broken down into two parts uh jesus is
[37:00] not praying a prayer here
[37:02] why would he have to pray to himself
[37:03] he's just it's not necessary but he's
[37:05] telling us how we as christians as
[37:07] believers can begin to pray and so the
[37:10] first half is making mention and tells
[37:12] about our father it tells about how good
[37:15] our father is and it talks and it's
[37:17] lifting him up when we look at the
[37:18] second half
[37:20] of this portion of scripture jesus is
[37:22] telling us about us
[37:24] it's telling about you and i it's
[37:26] telling about our needs and and and how
[37:28] god is going to provide our needs and
[37:30] telling us how to pray for our needs and
[37:33] then it ends up again with the believer
[37:35] again exhorting the father above all
[37:38] and so jesus is explaining here
[37:41] a relationship
[37:43] jesus is bringing into the people a
[37:45] relationship and a communication between
[37:48] us and him how we can approach god how
[37:52] do we talk to god and so the
[37:55] communication is being laid here and so
[37:57] how many tonight would agree with me in
[37:58] saying that we desire a closer walk with
[38:02] god tonight i want to know more about
[38:05] god than i've ever known before i want
[38:07] to know more about his riches i want to
[38:09] know more about his wealth i want to
[38:10] know more about his his love and his
[38:14] desire and what he would have for us
[38:17] in store for us
[38:19] tonight
[38:20] i heard a little humorous story and i i
[38:23] sometimes bring humor in but i'm careful
[38:24] with it but uh we're hot we're tired so
[38:27] maybe it'll lighten the evening okay
[38:30] so i heard this story about two men they
[38:32] were talking about which one was the
[38:34] real christian
[38:36] and and one said well i'm a christian
[38:38] and the other started and says you know
[38:40] i don't know about this i kind of doubt
[38:42] your confession that you're making here
[38:44] and
[38:45] and and i just don't believe you really
[38:46] are what you say i just don't believe
[38:48] you're really a christian
[38:51] he looked at him he said i tell you what
[38:53] in fact i'll bet you ten dollars but you
[38:56] don't even know the lord's prayer
[38:58] and this man thought about it for a
[39:00] minute
[39:01] he said okay
[39:03] i'll take that bet
[39:04] so the man looked at him and he said
[39:06] okay
[39:07] recite it to me
[39:09] so the man looked at him and he started
[39:11] now i lay me down to sleep i pray the
[39:14] lord my soul to keep
[39:16] if i should die before i wake i pray the
[39:18] lord my soul to take
[39:20] and the other man smiling
[39:22] looked at him reached in his pocket and
[39:24] he said well here's your ten dollars he
[39:26] said i didn't think you knew but you did
[39:32] they didn't have that intimate
[39:33] relationship
[39:35] with christ they both claimed that they
[39:37] were christians they both claimed to be
[39:39] something that they wasn't they didn't
[39:41] they wasn't well versed in the
[39:42] scriptures they wasn't able to
[39:44] relate with christ the way he wants to
[39:46] communicate with us
[39:49] and like i said i titled my message
[39:51] tonight
[39:53] life with an intimate god
[39:57] so in order to understand what life with
[39:59] an intimate god is like
[40:01] we have to understand what the word
[40:03] intimacy really means
[40:05] and when we we see the word intimacy we
[40:08] hear it we it varies from context to
[40:10] context and there's many people that
[40:12] hear the word intimacy they
[40:13] automatically think of a sexual
[40:15] interaction or
[40:16] a connotation but it's more than that
[40:19] intimacy is so much more than that
[40:22] as believers we sing songs that have to
[40:25] do with us being intimate with god and
[40:27] intimate with jesus
[40:29] and because our world connects intimacy
[40:32] with a sexual act
[40:34] it's difficult for the people to
[40:35] understand the true meaning of the word
[40:39] but listen to what it is intimacy means
[40:41] creating
[40:42] an authentic connection
[40:46] an authentic connection
[40:49] it has more to do with shared moments
[40:55] moments when you're connected with god
[40:58] moments that you can remember moments
[40:59] that you share and you can reflect back
[41:01] and say oh i remember god led me through
[41:04] this trial i remember when god healed me
[41:06] of this sickness i remember when god
[41:08] saved my children
[41:10] intimate shared moments with god
[41:14] intimacy is linked with feelings of
[41:16] closeness
[41:17] and safety
[41:19] and trust and transparency amongst
[41:22] partners
[41:25] you see it's so much more
[41:27] than an act
[41:29] intimacy is a feeling of closeness
[41:32] for intimacy to be sustainable and
[41:34] nourishing you it requires trust and
[41:37] transparency and the rituals of
[41:39] connection it requires empathy
[41:42] you know what empathy is
[41:44] empathy is being able to put yourself in
[41:46] somebody else's shoes and feel what they
[41:47] feel
[41:50] that is intimacy
[41:52] intimacy is having a very close friend
[41:55] or confidant
[41:57] it's marked by a very close association
[42:00] a contact or familiarity with a person
[42:04] you and that person become so close
[42:08] there's a relationship a bond the
[42:10] connection that's been made between you
[42:12] and another person
[42:15] and it's a warm friendship that's
[42:16] developed as time goes on as you get to
[42:19] know more and more and more about each
[42:21] other
[42:22] and we can see this begins to develop
[42:24] when young couples begin to date
[42:27] young couples begin to date and there
[42:28] becomes a feeling and it's more than
[42:30] just an attraction but it's a friendship
[42:32] it's a warmness
[42:33] and they begin to they begin to feel
[42:35] safe with one another they begin to
[42:37] trust one another
[42:39] next thing they do what they do they
[42:40] step up an engagement
[42:42] and they begin to go into the next
[42:44] portion of their life
[42:45] and it becomes even more and more
[42:47] trustworthy more safe a feeling of
[42:50] safety about it and transparency
[42:53] and it keeps going on and on and on
[42:54] until we get into the marriage stage
[42:58] you get into the marriage they didn't
[42:59] 100 complete transparent
[43:02] there's no secrets in marriage
[43:07] you're awful quiet
[43:10] if you've got secrets in your marriage
[43:12] we don't have a healthy marriage
[43:14] there's no secrets in marriage
[43:17] and it's much like our relationship with
[43:19] god it's a lot like that
[43:21] it consists of continual growth
[43:24] it consists of learning and developing
[43:27] and trusting god
[43:29] and being transparent
[43:31] just like in a marriage if you're not
[43:33] transparent with your spouse if you're
[43:34] not transparent with god that means
[43:36] you're hiding something from god
[43:38] you're not coming clean with everything
[43:40] that you've got before god
[43:42] so how can god bless you
[43:45] how can god fellowship with you how can
[43:48] god wrap his arm around you and
[43:50] completely love you the way he should
[43:52] and pull you close into his bosom if
[43:54] you're telling him lies
[43:56] if you're living a life of lies
[43:59] you see it's hard for the world
[44:02] or the unsaved person i should say to
[44:04] understand how we as christians desire
[44:07] an intimacy with jesus christ
[44:13] very few of any
[44:15] have laid eyes upon him
[44:18] very few if any have touched him or felt
[44:20] his touch
[44:24] but we still we sing songs to him
[44:27] we pray to him
[44:30] we worship him with all that's within us
[44:35] saint john 20 29 says blessed are they
[44:37] that have not seen but yet have believed
[44:42] i know he's real
[44:44] can i touch him
[44:45] no
[44:47] can i feel him i feel the spirit moving
[44:51] but to physically shake his hand put my
[44:53] arm around him
[44:55] no
[44:57] but i believe it
[44:58] and the world looks at us and they say
[45:01] man those people sing songs to a to a
[45:03] jesus to a god that they can't even
[45:05] touch feel see smell
[45:08] hear
[45:11] and they scratch their head in
[45:13] astonishment
[45:17] have you ever went to a restaurant you
[45:19] sat down to eat
[45:20] and you your family prays
[45:24] sometimes we'll join hands even at a
[45:25] restaurant and we'll pray
[45:29] and people
[45:31] look
[45:32] astonished
[45:35] wow
[45:36] what are they doing
[45:42] why is that
[45:44] it's because they don't get it
[45:47] they don't get it but but i get it
[45:50] you and i get it because we're child of
[45:52] god we're a child of god tonight we're
[45:54] children of god and we love him and we
[45:56] want to share that love with him we
[45:58] share the way we love god throughout the
[46:00] holy spirit and we get it
[46:03] it's a relationship intimacy means that
[46:06] we're creating an authentic connection
[46:08] between us and god
[46:10] a tight relationship so that your
[46:13] thoughts are intertwined with his
[46:15] attributes
[46:18] think about what i just said
[46:21] your thoughts are intertwined with his
[46:22] attributes
[46:25] your actions are the result
[46:27] of his word
[46:29] of his life
[46:32] being living out through you through the
[46:33] new earth
[46:41] you know
[46:42] god says it's for whosoever will
[46:47] i believe i'm looking at a lot of
[46:48] whosoever wills
[46:51] there's a relationship that god has
[46:53] built upon a new birth
[46:55] you know i was riding around the farm
[46:56] the other day and uh i noticed as i was
[46:59] riding
[47:00] there was a
[47:02] deer
[47:03] standing up in the edge of the woods
[47:06] and i just kept riding and i got closer
[47:09] and i got closer and i got closer
[47:12] and before you know it i'm 15 to 20
[47:14] yards from this deer
[47:17] and i'm sitting there and i'm thinking
[47:19] what is wrong with this crazy deer
[47:23] is this thing sick she looks healthy she
[47:24] looks like she's in good shape what is
[47:26] wrong with her why isn't she snorting
[47:28] and stomping and blowing why isn't she
[47:30] running away and then it dawned on me
[47:32] what time of year it is
[47:34] she's got a baby nearby
[47:37] she's no doubt got a baby nearby
[47:40] there's something in there the special
[47:42] connection there that that baby's bedded
[47:44] down and that birth when that new birth
[47:46] took place that deer's whole demeanor
[47:49] changed
[47:51] she says i'm going to stay here and
[47:52] watch over my baby i'm going to protect
[47:54] my little baby i'm not going to run i
[47:56] got to know that this person's not a
[47:58] threat to my baby
[48:01] why because and when that baby was born
[48:04] something kicked in
[48:06] it said a new birth
[48:08] i was talking to a friend who who's kind
[48:10] of associated with the with the alpha
[48:12] pregnancy center in hopkinsville
[48:15] and i just asked what is that all about
[48:18] because i didn't know and you know i was
[48:21] just thinking it was for
[48:23] you know women who who had gotten
[48:25] pregnant basically and out of wedlock
[48:28] that's what i thought it was no it's
[48:29] more than that there's a lot more to
[48:31] that the number one thing that they do
[48:33] is to try to prevent abortion
[48:36] and i thought that's a good deed
[48:38] they're trying to prevent abortion and
[48:40] he i said well how do you do that he
[48:41] said well studies have shown and we
[48:43] found out
[48:44] that if we can give them an ultrasound
[48:50] yep
[48:51] if we can give them an ultrasound
[48:53] and let them see the baby that they're
[48:55] carrying in their womb
[48:57] the risk or the chance for abortion
[49:00] decreases by oh 85 percent
[49:04] why is that
[49:05] it's because something has kicked in in
[49:07] that mother's mind i'm carrying a baby
[49:09] and i'm fixing to birth this baby and
[49:11] it's mine
[49:12] there's a relationship there that that
[49:14] baby is attached in the womb and she's
[49:17] nurturing and and getting her
[49:18] nourishment off that mother and now she
[49:20] realizes by picture
[49:23] this is my baby
[49:25] it's just like christians at the new
[49:27] birth
[49:28] so when something strikes your soul
[49:30] when something gets ahold of you and you
[49:32] give yourself to christ there's a bond
[49:34] that's formed
[49:36] there's a new level of commitment it's
[49:38] no longer just a church experience it's
[49:41] a god experience because there's been a
[49:43] birth to take place and that
[49:45] relationship is formed between you and
[49:47] god
[49:49] and the bible says that he will never
[49:51] leave you
[49:53] and he will never
[49:54] forsake you
[49:57] i'll not leave you comfortless i will
[49:59] come to you
[50:01] a little while in the world seeing me no
[50:02] more but you see me because you live and
[50:04] you shall live also and today you shall
[50:07] know that i am in my father and you and
[50:08] me and i in
[50:10] you do you see the connection
[50:13] do you see the bond that is built
[50:15] between jesus and us
[50:17] so brothers and sisters we have a
[50:18] promise tonight that we can rest assured
[50:21] that god's going to uphold his end of
[50:23] the deal
[50:25] god is going to uphold his end of the
[50:27] deal and we don't have to worry about
[50:28] that
[50:29] but a relationship is a two-way street
[50:33] oh there's where we get in trouble
[50:36] we want god to give and give and give
[50:39] and give
[50:41] and all we want to do is take and take
[50:43] and take and take
[50:45] that's not the way a relationship works
[50:48] you have to give and take you see when
[50:50] you're talking about an intimate
[50:51] relationship
[50:53] it's god says i'm going to give you so
[50:55] much of me
[50:57] but in return i want so much of you
[51:00] i want to hear you talk back to me i
[51:03] want to hear you pray to me i want to
[51:04] hear you sing to me i want to hear you
[51:06] whisper love songs in my ear
[51:09] our god has feelings
[51:12] he's looking for that he desires and is
[51:14] longing for us to communicate day by day
[51:17] by day with him
[51:20] it's reciprocating
[51:23] you know uh
[51:25] we uh
[51:28] as carpenters
[51:32] i guess we i guess i say i build stuff
[51:37] but we got reciprocating saws
[51:40] and it cuts both ways
[51:42] it cuts and it goes in and out
[51:44] cut cut cut cut cut
[51:47] now if i use a circular saw
[51:49] it's only spinning in one direction
[51:52] and it's just cutting constantly one
[51:54] direction if i reverse that blade you
[51:56] know what it'll do is set to burn the
[51:57] wood
[51:59] it won't cut
[52:00] because you're asking to do something
[52:02] that's not made to do and sometimes i
[52:04] thought about that and i thought you
[52:05] know sometimes we try to put the cart in
[52:07] front of the horse and we try to push
[52:09] people into church as a as a circular
[52:12] saw
[52:13] instead of giving them time to get
[52:15] accustomed and get acquainted with god
[52:17] to where they can reciprocate love with
[52:19] god we try to force them into church try
[52:22] to force them into doing things try to
[52:24] force them not to do things do's and
[52:26] don'ts
[52:28] and all we do is just light a fire in
[52:30] them of hatred and despise
[52:33] come on church
[52:36] we need to make sure that the
[52:37] relationships that we're trying to to
[52:39] push and to and to kindle are
[52:41] reciprocating relationships you ought to
[52:44] love god because god first loved you
[52:49] kyle calvary is the reason we have
[52:52] intimate relationship
[52:54] with god
[52:57] so we have a commitment to make
[53:00] ours is easy
[53:03] i said ours is easy
[53:06] god's
[53:08] not so much
[53:10] he took the hard road
[53:12] calvary was not an easy road
[53:16] being beaten is not an easy road
[53:19] being spit on and mopped is not an easy
[53:22] road and laying there and pinned up for
[53:25] the whole world to see and groaning and
[53:27] gasping for your last breath of life
[53:30] that's not easy
[53:32] let me ask you what was that
[53:34] that's love
[53:38] that's love
[53:39] it's the greatest love you'll ever
[53:41] experience in your life it's love it's
[53:43] god's passion for you
[53:45] it's god saying i'm committed to you i
[53:47] give my life i lay it down from the
[53:50] altar for you right here
[53:52] no matter what you do from this point on
[53:54] you're mine
[53:58] he didn't he didn't save us to lose us
[54:01] we try to throw people off the bridge
[54:02] when they make a mistake god don't work
[54:04] that way
[54:06] he may not like what you do he still
[54:08] loves you
[54:13] with that very thought it ought to make
[54:15] us want to worship god in a way we've
[54:17] never worshiped
[54:19] in order to make us want to pray to god
[54:21] in a way we've never prayed in order to
[54:22] set our hearts on fire and make us sell
[54:24] us in such a way that we say god i never
[54:27] want to lose this relationship with you
[54:34] there was a
[54:36] young disciple of christ
[54:38] and he was desiring
[54:40] all that god had for him
[54:43] he wanted god
[54:45] in all of his capacity
[54:48] and he visited the home of an elderly
[54:50] christian man and he'd heard about this
[54:52] man and this old man was up in the age
[54:55] and he had never lost his first love for
[54:58] jesus
[55:00] after all the years after all the trials
[55:02] after all the trouble he'd never lost
[55:04] his first love for christ
[55:06] and this elderly man was sitting out on
[55:08] a porch with his dog and he's taken in
[55:10] the sunset
[55:12] and this young man asked him said why is
[55:14] it sir
[55:15] that most christians
[55:17] zealously chase after god during the
[55:19] first year or two
[55:21] of their conversion
[55:23] but then they fall into a complacent
[55:25] ritual
[55:30] let's be careful
[55:32] but then they fall into a complacent
[55:34] ritual where they go to church once or
[55:36] twice a week and they end up not looking
[55:38] any different than than their neighbors
[55:40] and they don't look any different than
[55:42] unbelievers and they don't look any
[55:43] different than those people that that
[55:45] aren't even christians
[55:47] he said i've heard though mister that
[55:50] you're not like that i've been told that
[55:52] you have fervently sought after god
[55:54] throughout all of your life
[55:57] people see something in you
[55:59] but they don't see most other people
[56:03] who call themselves christian what makes
[56:05] you different
[56:06] sir what makes you different
[56:09] and the old man smiled and he replied he
[56:11] said son let me tell you a story
[56:14] he says one day i was sitting here
[56:15] quietly in the sun with my dog
[56:18] and suddenly this large jackrabbit
[56:21] jumped up and ran across the yard in
[56:22] front of us and he said well my dog
[56:24] jumped off and took off after it it's a
[56:27] big old jackrabbit he chased the rabbit
[56:29] over the hills with passion
[56:32] soon other dogs joined him attracted by
[56:36] his barking
[56:37] and he said what a sight it was as i sat
[56:38] here and i watched this pack of dogs and
[56:40] they ran across the creeks and up the
[56:42] banks and threw the thickets and through
[56:43] the thorns
[56:45] he said gradually though however one by
[56:48] one the other dogs dropped out of the
[56:50] pursuit
[56:52] they were discouraged by the course they
[56:54] were frustrated by the chase
[56:56] and only my dog continued to hotly
[56:58] pursue that little jack rabbit
[57:02] in that story young man lies the answer
[57:04] to your question
[57:07] you know that young man he said he sat
[57:08] there confused it's silent
[57:12] and he said sir i don't understand
[57:14] what is the connection between the jack
[57:17] rabbit chase and the quest for god
[57:20] you fail to understand says the old man
[57:23] because you failed to ask the obvious
[57:25] question
[57:26] the obvious question is why didn't the
[57:28] other dogs continue on in the chase
[57:32] and the answer to that question son is
[57:34] this
[57:36] they have not seen the rabbit
[57:41] think about that
[57:43] they had not seen the rabbit
[57:47] and unless you have seen the prize
[57:49] brothers and sisters
[57:51] the chase is too difficult
[57:54] why do people fall away
[57:57] they have not seen the prize
[57:59] they've not laid eyes upon the jesus
[58:02] that you've seen they don't see jesus as
[58:04] savior and healer and delivery counselor
[58:06] and friend and provider and lover
[58:10] they not laid eyes on him in that
[58:11] capacity so therefore they begin to fall
[58:14] away
[58:14] and because they lack the passion they
[58:16] lack the determination to keep up in the
[58:19] race and stay in the chase
[58:26] god desires to have a close
[58:29] intimate
[58:30] personal
[58:32] loving dynamic powerful relationship
[58:36] with you
[58:38] the deeper the more intimate the more
[58:40] genuine the more real your relationship
[58:42] with god is
[58:44] you know what happens
[58:45] the more the devils the more demons
[58:48] begin to fear and tremble in your
[58:50] presence
[58:52] they say oh my goodness he's up again
[58:58] i can't believe his feats hit the floor
[59:00] again this morning i'm gonna have to
[59:01] him all day today
[59:05] she's going to be a witness everywhere
[59:07] she goes
[59:13] what are we going to do
[59:20] how many times have you asked or thought
[59:22] to people are you a christian
[59:27] many times we get the answer we perceive
[59:29] as well i've been baptized or i go to
[59:32] church
[59:35] well that's not going to tell us a whole
[59:36] lot
[59:38] that's not really answering the question
[59:40] the better question we ought to ask is
[59:42] are you in love with jesus
[59:46] then you'll get the right answer
[59:48] then you'll find out where the truth
[59:49] really lies do you are you in love with
[59:51] jesus oh yes i'll tell you what i can't
[59:54] wait to get to church on sunday morning
[59:56] i can't wait when i go to work i turn my
[59:59] radio up and i listen to those songs of
[1:00:01] worship and praise and it just fires my
[1:00:03] soul up
[1:00:07] are you a christian are you in love with
[1:00:09] christ
[1:00:10] well i love going to the
[1:00:12] honky honky-tonk
[1:00:15] you say what i'm saying
[1:00:18] the actions speak a little different
[1:00:19] when you ask the question in the right
[1:00:21] way are you in love with jesus because
[1:00:23] it's time brothers and sisters it's time
[1:00:25] that we submit and we obey and we get
[1:00:28] down to the real deal
[1:00:29] are you really a christian are you
[1:00:31] really what you say you are
[1:00:35] because it's maturing time and faith
[1:00:37] it's time to develop a close personal
[1:00:39] intimate relationship with god because
[1:00:42] when you've got this intimate
[1:00:43] relationship it allows god to look down
[1:00:45] into your heart
[1:00:48] and it doesn't stop there
[1:00:51] god opens up himself and allows us to
[1:00:54] look down into him and to see what all
[1:00:57] lies in there
[1:00:59] when you open up the word
[1:01:01] have you ever opened up a word and read
[1:01:03] a scripture that you've read 10 or 15
[1:01:05] times in your life and you read it again
[1:01:06] and it's something new it's a new
[1:01:08] revelation to you what is that that's
[1:01:10] god saying i'm going to open myself up
[1:01:12] to you son
[1:01:13] i'm going to open myself up to you
[1:01:15] daughter
[1:01:16] i want to share myself with you this
[1:01:18] morning
[1:01:22] imagine looking into the heart of god
[1:01:24] and seeing what he sees
[1:01:27] the scripture says you shall love the
[1:01:29] lord your god with
[1:01:32] all
[1:01:33] your heart with what all
[1:01:37] your soul with what all
[1:01:39] your mind and with what all
[1:01:41] your strength
[1:01:45] oh
[1:01:47] they didn't say a little
[1:01:49] it didn't say some
[1:01:51] it didn't say when you feel like it
[1:01:53] because let me tell you a lot of times i
[1:01:54] don't feel like it
[1:01:59] i tell you sometimes you know
[1:02:02] i don't know maybe it's just me but
[1:02:04] sometimes you just get into mulley grubs
[1:02:08] even my wife asked me today what's wrong
[1:02:09] with what's going on
[1:02:11] nothing
[1:02:12] oh there's something going on i can tell
[1:02:14] no it's nothing i just not nothing
[1:02:17] oh it's something
[1:02:19] it because you got to preach no it's not
[1:02:20] that i'm not it's not that i'm not
[1:02:22] nervous but i'm good
[1:02:24] what is it i don't know nothing there's
[1:02:26] nothing just i'm in the milly grips
[1:02:31] but god allows us
[1:02:34] opportunities like that
[1:02:36] to take advantage of those opportunities
[1:02:39] because i told myself i was walking i
[1:02:41] told myself i said you know i can either
[1:02:42] keep my mind set on the way i feel right
[1:02:45] now
[1:02:46] and discouragement and disgust
[1:02:51] or
[1:02:53] or i can turn on some music that gets me
[1:02:56] excited about god and i can sit down
[1:02:58] here and i can just tell god how good
[1:03:00] you've been to me god you've given me a
[1:03:02] wonderful family you've given me a great
[1:03:04] home you've given me a wonderful church
[1:03:06] family you give me a good pastor you've
[1:03:08] given me a beautiful place you've given
[1:03:10] us automobiles and food and clothes and
[1:03:13] it goes on and on and on it doesn't quit
[1:03:16] and you know what all of a sudden i got
[1:03:17] the feeling i got to step in a little
[1:03:18] higher you know i wasn't as discouraged
[1:03:21] as i was anymore because i realized it
[1:03:24] was all a negative connotation in my
[1:03:26] mind between me and where i stood what's
[1:03:30] happening around me means nothing
[1:03:34] what's happening between me and god
[1:03:37] means everything
[1:03:44] stay with me as we go through these
[1:03:45] quotes here
[1:03:49] man was born to have fellowship
[1:03:52] man in the beginning back in the garden
[1:03:54] of eden he had a wonderful fellowship
[1:03:57] god would come down and fellowship with
[1:03:59] this company of men and woman
[1:04:03] adam and eve every evening in the cool
[1:04:05] of the evening he would come down under
[1:04:07] the great palm trees
[1:04:09] paint the picture in your mind god would
[1:04:12] come down under the great palm trees and
[1:04:14] perhaps his sacred light as it was was
[1:04:17] shining down on adam and eve and that
[1:04:19] great cathedral out in the open
[1:04:23] something about
[1:04:24] nature and god coming down there in the
[1:04:27] garden fellowshipping
[1:04:30] and adam and eve out there
[1:04:31] fellowshipping with god they had nothing
[1:04:33] to worry about
[1:04:35] as long as they were fellowshipping
[1:04:39] he says because the greatest fellowship
[1:04:40] that any man ever has when he fellowship
[1:04:43] with god
[1:04:44] and god gave himself open to man to
[1:04:47] fellowship back and forth
[1:04:49] with his
[1:04:50] creature
[1:04:52] the creator fellow shipping
[1:04:55] with the creature
[1:04:58] and god is fellowshipping with adam in
[1:05:00] the garden and adam has nothing to worry
[1:05:02] about everything is smooth it's running
[1:05:04] right he didn't have to worry about
[1:05:05] clothes he didn't have to worry about
[1:05:07] something to eat he didn't have to worry
[1:05:08] about sickness he didn't have to worry
[1:05:10] about death or sorrow
[1:05:13] because father
[1:05:15] the heavenly father who watched over him
[1:05:17] and fellowshipped with him daily
[1:05:22] wow
[1:05:25] listen now
[1:05:27] god
[1:05:28] longs for that fellowship
[1:05:31] he yearns he wants people to speak with
[1:05:34] him to talk with them
[1:05:36] he said you might sing too much
[1:05:39] i might preach too much
[1:05:41] but one thing i'll never do too much of
[1:05:43] is pray
[1:05:45] fellowship because god is yearning for
[1:05:48] that you can't overdo it
[1:05:50] the bible says man everywhere to pray
[1:05:52] and lift up holy hands you can never
[1:05:54] have too much fellowship with god
[1:05:59] so let me ask you what happened
[1:06:01] to that kind of fellowship
[1:06:05] what happened to that kind of fellowship
[1:06:06] that that fellowship was lost
[1:06:08] stay with me now it's important
[1:06:11] i got about 15 more minutes
[1:06:16] the old serpent
[1:06:19] he found his way
[1:06:22] in to break fellowship between adam and
[1:06:25] eve
[1:06:27] and ultimately breaking fellowship
[1:06:29] between them
[1:06:30] and god
[1:06:33] now think about this scene we painted
[1:06:34] where god's coming down his his shekinah
[1:06:37] glory the the glory of god is shining
[1:06:40] down upon adam and eve and the cool of
[1:06:41] eden and can you imagine old satan that
[1:06:43] old devil surfaced in there and he's
[1:06:45] looking at all this and he's thinking my
[1:06:47] goodness
[1:06:48] what is happening here
[1:06:51] what is what is taking place here
[1:06:53] and i can imagine him just standing back
[1:06:55] and looking at this and thinking
[1:06:58] we didn't have this in heaven
[1:07:01] no all they did in heaven was sing and
[1:07:04] worship and praise that's all they did
[1:07:06] in heaven but what is going on now what
[1:07:08] is this i've never seen this before
[1:07:11] why
[1:07:12] why's god wrapping his arm around adam
[1:07:16] and wrapping his arm around eve
[1:07:19] and why is he pulling a man close
[1:07:22] is he whispering in their ear what is he
[1:07:24] doing
[1:07:31] look at them every day
[1:07:34] when the sun sets
[1:07:36] it's cool
[1:07:38] it's calm
[1:07:40] what's happening
[1:07:42] fellowship
[1:07:45] fellowship
[1:07:48] it's if aiden begins to look at this
[1:07:50] fellowship
[1:07:52] he says
[1:07:53] i got to do something to get between
[1:07:56] this
[1:07:57] i've got to do something to break this
[1:07:59] up
[1:08:01] i've got to do something so that this
[1:08:02] doesn't happen every day
[1:08:05] and and he said here's to adam and eve
[1:08:08] and eve a beautiful woman and adam with
[1:08:10] his dark shaggy locks hanging down
[1:08:12] around his head and those eyes looking
[1:08:14] over his little sweetheart
[1:08:16] a perfectly built woman
[1:08:20] he said in her hair and she looked up
[1:08:22] and her eyes as blue as the sky
[1:08:26] and adam loved her he said oh how he
[1:08:29] loved her
[1:08:33] we just think we know a love story we
[1:08:35] think these novels sometimes these women
[1:08:37] get hung up in these novels and
[1:08:39] hallmark and
[1:08:41] christmas reason
[1:08:43] no
[1:08:45] he loved her
[1:08:47] adam loved her he said oh how he loved
[1:08:50] her but when sin entered in
[1:08:53] their little home was broke
[1:08:58] when sin entered in her their little
[1:09:00] home was broke up because of an old
[1:09:02] lustful beast
[1:09:05] he said the devil that got into the
[1:09:06] animal called a serpent not a reptile
[1:09:09] no no the devil was not a snake
[1:09:13] no he wasn't a snake in the beginning
[1:09:15] like he is now he was cursed
[1:09:18] he was a beast
[1:09:21] he was more subtle than
[1:09:23] any beast he looked more like a man than
[1:09:26] anything you've ever had he walked
[1:09:28] upright
[1:09:32] there's where the devil got in him
[1:09:35] and he come to eve this beautiful made
[1:09:38] woman
[1:09:39] and she did what was wrong
[1:09:43] what did she
[1:09:46] do she broke that intimate relationship
[1:09:52] for a lustful
[1:09:53] desire
[1:10:00] and then she brought forth her son cain
[1:10:04] who had the nature of his daddy
[1:10:06] a murderer
[1:10:09] a hater
[1:10:11] a killer
[1:10:16] what happened to that stillness that
[1:10:18] whisper that softness that gentleness
[1:10:23] it was broken
[1:10:25] the fellowship had been broken
[1:10:29] and god when he come down to talk and
[1:10:31] that fellowship been broken he says can
[1:10:32] you imagine adam and eve sitting in the
[1:10:34] garden under those palm trees and god
[1:10:36] would come down and say my children
[1:10:41] and they say yes
[1:10:42] father
[1:10:44] is all well
[1:10:46] yes father all is well
[1:10:48] have you enjoyed the blessings of your
[1:10:50] father this day
[1:10:54] it's before the fall he's retelling the
[1:10:56] story before the fall yes father we've
[1:10:58] enjoyed the blessings you've given us
[1:11:00] today
[1:11:02] and he says listen now here comes leo
[1:11:05] the line
[1:11:07] he said in leo the lion comes up and
[1:11:10] meows like a kitten and adam pats him on
[1:11:13] the head and he kneels himself down and
[1:11:15] here comes cheetah
[1:11:17] and the tiger and all them comes up and
[1:11:19] lays down in meows and god's great voice
[1:11:22] roaring through the treetops my creation
[1:11:26] have you enjoyed what i've made for you
[1:11:28] today
[1:11:32] yes father every day no death no sorrow
[1:11:35] no sickness
[1:11:37] it's wonderful
[1:11:39] and then
[1:11:41] the first thing you know
[1:11:44] the sin
[1:11:46] she said
[1:11:48] and god came down roared through the
[1:11:50] treetops wants to be worshipped he's god
[1:11:53] and his children wasn't there to worship
[1:11:58] and here come leo and knelt down there
[1:12:01] and cheetah come up and knelt down and
[1:12:03] they come up and kneel down and but
[1:12:04] where's adam
[1:12:09] he's not there
[1:12:11] god like he's done every single day
[1:12:13] since the creation has come down in
[1:12:15] fellowship and wanted to talk and get
[1:12:18] intimate with adam and eve and he comes
[1:12:20] down this time and there is no adam
[1:12:23] there is no eve
[1:12:25] and he says leo have you seen him have
[1:12:27] you seen adam no
[1:12:29] adam where art thou
[1:12:34] cheetah have you seen adam
[1:12:37] no
[1:12:38] adam where art thou
[1:12:44] he says see it's the nature of man to
[1:12:45] run from god
[1:12:48] when the fellowship's been broken
[1:12:52] you ever notice that when people get
[1:12:54] away from god
[1:12:55] what do they do they run as hard as they
[1:12:57] can to get away from church from
[1:12:59] preachers from from from their parents
[1:13:01] that are that are christians
[1:13:04] from the past they see the pastor coming
[1:13:05] whoop no the other way
[1:13:10] why is that
[1:13:11] it's because that fellowship's been
[1:13:13] broken and they find themselves in that
[1:13:15] atom state where they're running from
[1:13:16] god because there's no fellowship there
[1:13:19] and it ought to have been adam saying
[1:13:21] father i've sinned
[1:13:22] father i've done wrong father i'm wrong
[1:13:25] where are you i need to confess to you
[1:13:27] where are you god
[1:13:34] but he's hiding
[1:13:36] adam where art thou my boy where aren't
[1:13:39] there adam adam my boy we're hard thou
[1:13:43] and directly he looks over he sees adam
[1:13:45] standing behind the bushes
[1:13:46] and he says come out adam
[1:13:50] what's his reply
[1:13:52] i can't
[1:13:53] i'm naked
[1:13:58] who told you
[1:14:01] you were naked
[1:14:03] the woman you gave me
[1:14:07] broken fellowship
[1:14:09] distrust
[1:14:11] uncommitted
[1:14:13] undevoted
[1:14:18] and the woman said the serpent did it
[1:14:24] the serpent did it
[1:14:28] the greatest picture of fellowship
[1:14:32] broken
[1:14:34] i could have titled this message a
[1:14:36] heartbroken god
[1:14:40] can you imagine
[1:14:42] the feeling god must have had
[1:14:46] when he stepped on the scene that day
[1:14:49] and the love
[1:14:50] of his life
[1:14:52] those two
[1:14:54] hid from him
[1:14:56] when everything that he had built the
[1:14:58] world he created around them
[1:15:02] now
[1:15:03] broke
[1:15:04] in ruins
[1:15:09] he wasn't heartbroken because
[1:15:11] of what was going to happen
[1:15:13] he was heartbroken because of the
[1:15:15] distrust
[1:15:16] and the lack of fellowship
[1:15:21] he says god can't talk to his people no
[1:15:23] more
[1:15:25] and god's got to keep his word
[1:15:28] so god went over and got some sheepskins
[1:15:31] a couple of innocent little lambs and he
[1:15:34] slayed those lambs and and stripped the
[1:15:36] hives off of those lambs and took them
[1:15:38] over there into the bushes and said took
[1:15:40] those bloody sheepskins and thrown them
[1:15:41] back i said put them on
[1:15:48] and here come adam and eve
[1:15:51] wrapped up in these sheeps
[1:15:54] and they come out and wrapped up in
[1:15:55] these sheepskins of blood
[1:15:57] coming down dripping over his manly
[1:15:59] shoulders he says
[1:16:02] and eve the pretty little thing adam
[1:16:04] sweetheart his darling comes out and
[1:16:06] blood running down her legs
[1:16:09] and the blood running off adam's
[1:16:10] shoulders
[1:16:11] and i can see it here wrapped around his
[1:16:13] shoulder and the blood
[1:16:15] in his hair
[1:16:16] and eve has bent down
[1:16:19] her head bent down them old bloody
[1:16:20] sheepskins and walk out before god
[1:16:26] brother and sister i don't ever want to
[1:16:28] have to approach god in that manner
[1:16:32] i want to be able to approach god head
[1:16:34] on with a smile on my face and say lord
[1:16:37] it's a beautiful day to see you today
[1:16:40] and eve now walks and
[1:16:46] says have i done
[1:16:49] what have we done
[1:16:54] it's gone
[1:16:58] god said adam
[1:17:01] because you listened to your wife
[1:17:02] instead of me
[1:17:04] i took you from the dust of the earth
[1:17:06] and now to the dust you'll return
[1:17:10] woman because you listen to the serpent
[1:17:12] instead of your own husband
[1:17:17] because you listen to a serpent instead
[1:17:19] of your own husband
[1:17:24] he said i'll multiply your sorrows in
[1:17:26] conception
[1:17:28] because you caused the innocent lives of
[1:17:30] two little lambs
[1:17:31] now when you produce life you'll be in
[1:17:33] sorrow and you'll in conception you'll
[1:17:35] just
[1:17:38] pain
[1:17:40] and serpent because you did this off
[1:17:43] goes your legs
[1:17:45] and you'll crawl on your belly all the
[1:17:46] days of your life
[1:17:49] and you'll be hated
[1:17:51] and the dust shall be your meat
[1:17:57] what a what a change in
[1:17:59] scenario
[1:18:00] what a change in scenery here
[1:18:03] oh my something's happening
[1:18:06] aches begin to come into eve's shoulders
[1:18:10] oh
[1:18:12] ah
[1:18:14] adam
[1:18:15] has now got rheumatism in his back
[1:18:20] arthritis
[1:18:25] don't ask me how he knew it he just knew
[1:18:26] it
[1:18:28] he begins to look and he looks over at
[1:18:30] eve of tears running down her pretty
[1:18:32] cheeks and her lips that have never had
[1:18:34] any manicure on them
[1:18:37] he said it's
[1:18:38] look in there now and there's
[1:18:41] lips that were once red
[1:18:43] natural red
[1:18:44] are turning pale
[1:18:46] and wrinkly
[1:18:50] wrinkles
[1:18:52] are coming under her eyes
[1:18:54] you can't hide it ladies
[1:18:57] you can try
[1:18:58] it's coming
[1:19:00] it's scriptural
[1:19:03] wrinkles now coming under her eyes
[1:19:06] adam's hair begins to slip out
[1:19:12] shag begins to come out here
[1:19:14] graves begin to set in
[1:19:18] i was at a nursing home today giving
[1:19:20] shots
[1:19:21] given the vaccines and the lady looked
[1:19:23] up to me and she said son what happened
[1:19:25] to your hair you had hair last time you
[1:19:27] was here i don't know who she thought i
[1:19:28] was
[1:19:29] but i said i ain't had hair in a while
[1:19:33] i said some people turn gray mine turns
[1:19:35] loose
[1:19:38] tears dropping off of his manly chest
[1:19:43] his chest begin to sink in
[1:19:47] hollow
[1:19:51] can you see the transformation of losing
[1:19:54] fellowship with god
[1:19:57] the transformation that takes place when
[1:19:59] you get away from talking with
[1:20:02] god and even knew she was the cause of
[1:20:06] it and says adam what have i done
[1:20:08] darling
[1:20:11] what have i done
[1:20:14] i'm because of it we're condemned
[1:20:17] look at us we're turning back to dust
[1:20:18] and god has hit his face from us
[1:20:21] we can't see him no more look at these
[1:20:23] bloody skins i'm ashamed of this i'm
[1:20:26] ashamed of what i become
[1:20:28] adam
[1:20:30] darling i would take all of this off of
[1:20:32] you
[1:20:33] if i could
[1:20:36] but it's happened to us honey
[1:20:43] and god said
[1:20:46] depart
[1:20:47] out of my presence
[1:20:53] that almost makes my heart skip a beat
[1:20:56] it puts a pit in my stomach
[1:20:59] to think of the importance of the
[1:21:00] fellowship
[1:21:02] and how important intimacy is with god
[1:21:05] and how important it is that we stay
[1:21:07] focused and committed and love god and
[1:21:10] the way he wants to be loved and
[1:21:12] worshipped
[1:21:14] because i cannot imagine
[1:21:18] to hear that word depart
[1:21:21] from my presence
[1:21:25] but he said depart
[1:21:27] from my presence
[1:21:28] no matter how bad it hurt him
[1:21:31] he had to keep his word
[1:21:37] he said adam put his arm around his
[1:21:38] little
[1:21:40] wife and they started moving down
[1:21:43] through the garden of eden
[1:21:45] and i could hear that old bloody
[1:21:46] sheepskin
[1:21:50] slapping on their side
[1:21:52] as a reminder
[1:21:54] of what they've done
[1:22:01] brothers and sisters we all
[1:22:04] have our gardens to walk through
[1:22:08] we all have our
[1:22:10] serpents to face
[1:22:14] but praise god for a hill called calvary
[1:22:18] because on that hill called calvary
[1:22:21] you could still come back today and
[1:22:23] enter into that place of fellowship
[1:22:25] because of a place called calvary you
[1:22:27] can have an intimate relationship with
[1:22:29] god because of a place called calvary
[1:22:31] you can have a life in harmony with god
[1:22:34] you don't need those bloody lambskins
[1:22:36] tonight you don't need last skins draped
[1:22:38] over you because the blood of jesus
[1:22:40] christ was shed on the cross over two
[1:22:42] thousand years ago and that blood covers
[1:22:45] us and it
[1:22:46] it preserves us and it makes a way of
[1:22:49] fellowship back between us and christ
[1:22:51] and that's what we're striving for
[1:22:54] thank god for the blood
[1:22:59] the death burial resurrection
[1:23:02] that's what unifies us
[1:23:04] in christ
[1:23:08] i must find a place to stop here
[1:23:12] the book of luke
[1:23:15] the book of luke tells us all about the
[1:23:16] life of jesus christ amongst the people
[1:23:21] think about it you read the gospels and
[1:23:23] i'm focusing on luke and you'll you'll
[1:23:25] see why here in a minute but the book of
[1:23:27] luke it focuses on and tells all about
[1:23:29] what jesus did around the people amongst
[1:23:32] the people everywhere he went what do
[1:23:33] the people see how he treat the people
[1:23:36] right
[1:23:38] well you go over into the book of acts
[1:23:41] which many scholars believe is a
[1:23:42] continuation of the book of luke
[1:23:46] what happens in the book of acts
[1:23:48] it's no longer about god or jesus
[1:23:51] amongst the people as described in the
[1:23:53] book of luke now it's talking about
[1:23:56] jesus
[1:23:58] in
[1:23:59] the people
[1:24:02] on the day of pentecost when the fire
[1:24:04] came down
[1:24:05] what was that it was god indwelling in
[1:24:08] his people it was god making a way back
[1:24:10] after calvary to come down and say i'm
[1:24:12] now going to communicate with you now
[1:24:14] i'm going to move myself in you and now
[1:24:17] you're going to move for me
[1:24:24] jesus dwelling inside of us
[1:24:26] jesus dwelling inside of us no longer
[1:24:29] rejected as king of the jews
[1:24:32] no longer rejected as king of the jesus
[1:24:34] jews but now he's accepted as king of
[1:24:36] kings and lord of lords right here
[1:24:39] right here in my heart right there in
[1:24:41] your heart right there where jesus comes
[1:24:42] in and you feel that little fire that
[1:24:44] burns inside that says i need more of
[1:24:46] you god
[1:24:51] the holy ghost is not just a a theory
[1:24:55] but it's an experience
[1:24:57] it's an experience that you'll live
[1:24:58] every day of your life if you walk with
[1:25:00] christ
[1:25:01] it's an experience that is so real it's
[1:25:04] what causes you to grow in god it's what
[1:25:05] gives you that intimate relationship
[1:25:07] when that holy ghost dwells in you it
[1:25:10] inspires you to act under the authority
[1:25:12] of jesus christ
[1:25:15] you want that garden to be an experience
[1:25:17] get in with god
[1:25:23] the spirit makes your body and actions
[1:25:25] react to the inspiration
[1:25:28] it's no longer do's and don'ts
[1:25:33] you know for years i heard don't do this
[1:25:35] don't do that believers don't do this
[1:25:37] believers don't do that women don't do
[1:25:39] this women don't do that i heard all the
[1:25:40] doo doo doo's and don't don't don'ts
[1:25:42] i've ever wanted to hear
[1:25:44] because you know what it means
[1:25:46] it means if you're having to be told not
[1:25:48] to do or do that or don't do you don't
[1:25:51] have a relationship with god anyway
[1:25:56] but when you get that personal
[1:25:57] relationship with god it's not about
[1:26:00] do's and don'ts
[1:26:01] but it's a message of respect
[1:26:04] stay with me just another minute message
[1:26:06] of respect
[1:26:08] i don't have this in my notes but you
[1:26:10] know i've never had to tell my wife
[1:26:12] don't you do this
[1:26:15] don't you do that
[1:26:17] i joke with her every now and then i say
[1:26:20] you know what i'm fixing to tell you the
[1:26:21] rules of this house
[1:26:25] no
[1:26:26] i don't have to tell her that
[1:26:28] i don't have to worry when she goes
[1:26:29] somewhere she don't have to worry when i
[1:26:31] go somewhere
[1:26:32] because i'm not going to do anything i
[1:26:34] shouldn't do you know why because i love
[1:26:36] her
[1:26:37] i love her with the love greater than i
[1:26:39] could ever show any person
[1:26:41] on this earth
[1:26:43] she's my wife
[1:26:45] i'm a spouse to her
[1:26:48] we have a relationship
[1:26:50] it's a trust it's a commitment it's a
[1:26:53] dedication
[1:26:57] i trust your marriage is that way
[1:26:59] because that's what god that's what
[1:27:00] christ is looking for
[1:27:02] he's looking for a church he's looking
[1:27:04] for a bride without spa or wrinkle
[1:27:07] that's what he's looking for he's
[1:27:08] looking for a church that's not
[1:27:10] committing spiritual fornications
[1:27:16] you know god's a jealous god
[1:27:18] i'm closing i promise
[1:27:21] god is a jealous god
[1:27:24] he's not going to share his bride
[1:27:27] with anything in this world
[1:27:32] he's not going to do it
[1:27:33] he's not going to do it
[1:27:39] he says the church
[1:27:41] is found committing spiritual
[1:27:43] fornication
[1:27:44] he said just like a woman would share
[1:27:46] her love from her husband to another man
[1:27:48] that woman's not fit to be lived with
[1:27:52] if it
[1:27:56] i'm just going to leave that alone
[1:28:02] when the church begins to share her
[1:28:04] fellowship with the world
[1:28:05] god is a jealous god he put israel away
[1:28:08] from that
[1:28:09] for that and he'll do the same thing for
[1:28:12] you he's going to have a bride listen
[1:28:16] he's going to have a bride that hasn't
[1:28:17] got a wrinkle in
[1:28:24] she's wholly washed
[1:28:26] by the blood of his own self
[1:28:30] let's stand our feet
[1:28:33] i feel like we got 20 avenues we could
[1:28:35] go down
[1:28:40] we'll leave that up to brother balor
[1:28:41] when he gets back
[1:28:46] you love the lord tonight musicians as
[1:28:48] you come brother josh
[1:28:54] you just put that little song up maybe
[1:28:56] if we pull it up oh how i love jesus
[1:29:02] if you just play that
[1:29:04] who's playing tonight
[1:29:10] there's nothing like the love of jesus
[1:29:13] there's nothing like the fellowship of
[1:29:14] jesus
[1:29:18] there's nothing like it
[1:29:20] [Music]
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:31] [Music]
