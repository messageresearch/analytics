attributes of god amen what he is and everything that he has amen so i hope you don't get bored with this amen because if you're bored now we're going to be doing this for about 100 million decades after time is no more we're going to be glorifying god how many believes that uh yeah we're never going to quit time we're never going to quit somebody say that we're never never gonna quit say it again we're never gonna quit because there's a lot of people quit but we're never gonna quit right no we ain't gonna quit no sir praise be to god i am we tell you what amen and i'll tell you what whenever i go to taking my last breath that's when i'm just getting started you ain't seen nothing yet amen how about you you ain't seen nothing yet right god is good so saint john 10 saint john 10 and we spoke sunday i believe on the door right the doorway amen he is the door he is the way i am the door verse 9. it says by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture i like that the key thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am calm that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly can somebody say amen boy that's right i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep but he that isn't harling and not not the shepherd who's owned a sheep or not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeteth and watch the wolf catches them and scattereth the sheep the hiring fleet because he is in hireling and careth not for the sheep i am the good shepherd amen i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine amen as the father knoweth me even so no i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep have i which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and they shall be one fold and one shepherd amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated tonight so this evening for a little while we want to talk about the good shepherd amen but you know one thing i was thinking about back there and that is that it looked like this shepherd they called himself the good shepherd you know how that how many knows that at the end of jesus's life uh the pharisees and perhaps the world and everything about perhaps the atmosphere of the end of jesus ministry seemed like a complete failure a complete failure and that's a lot for a preacher to say up here because here he had thousands following him at one time right he had such big crowds until he had to you know say things that within the crowd down caused people to go away he was very popular there for a while you know as long as he's healing the sick and so forth but there at the end we know that he was taken captive something that wasn't really expected by the disciples things did not turn out the way the disciples expected and when jesus had told him that i'm going to be killed and so forth and everything that's going to happen peter didn't like it too well he didn't like the course the channel and direction that it was going to go for jesus and it seemed like his sheep i mean those had all scattered right his sheep had all scattered even his own disciples you know had left and you know jesus at one place over here in verse let me see verse 28 he says i will give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand and my father which is gave them me is greater than all and no man shall be able to pluck them out of my father's hand so it sounded like you know you're saying there is nobody going to plug my sheep out of my hand but what ended up as far as the natural looking like a complete disaster was not a disaster at all how many knows that everybody had forsaken and that's one of the things that hurt i believe jesus in his heart so much is that he had to walk alone he had to go to that cross alone everybody denied him and walked away from him and yeah he had zero almost zero people that really stood behind him maybe mary she did there she took up for him going to the cross but very few but he kept talking about laying down his life for the sheep because guess what he was never going to save the sheep there was only one way to save the sheep and that was the lays down lies down for the sheep isn't that right and of course we know that none of these disciples he says and i have he's have one place he says that he has lost none of them but one judas talking about jesus judas that the scriptures might be fulfilled he knew that judas was going to leave him all along and that right and betray him and so forth but other than that he didn't lose the one of his sheep shortly scattered for a little while but whenever god gets you in his hand he's not going to let you go i'm glad that but we could take the entire service tonight and talk about eternal security amen and a real genuine believer that saved and sanctified i mean i'm talking about real genuine born again amen they are sealed until the day of their redemption amen when god gets a hold of you there is nobody and nothing going to pluck oh my can you imagine i can't imagine somebody going up to god trying to open his hand and say give me your sheep huh i'm gonna take this up i'm gonna pluck this out of your hand i'm gonna take this from you ain't nobody gonna do that and jesus made that clear huh that when you come to god if you are of god and you know that's that's a big thing how many knows it's a big thing of whether or not you're a sheep it's really big how big is it brother before we go into a couple of these thoughts because i want to i want to speak on a couple of couple of these things and we also want to talk about how that god has shepherds amen and that he shepherds through people i mean knows that god shepherds through people amen but let's go i want to talk about just for a few minutes here at the opening about the importance of what it is about sheep shepherds and goats all right in matthew 25 when jesus begins to talk about the very judgment when the judgment day comes all right this is in chapter 25 of matthew and verse 31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him that shall see he set upon the throne of his glory oh my let's go there for a minute shall we can you imagine what it's going to be like when he sits upon the throne of his glory amen and before him shall be gathered huh all of our politicians democrats republicans the whole world huh the russian president all of these great people all nations it says everybody is going to come before him all nations and what is he going to do when this happens and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats huh now i don't know much about shepherding other than being a pastor here in people but now when it comes to actual sheep and goats apparently you don't keep the two together right i guess we could use an example goats don't go too well with sheep why because they butt too much they're always budding you see you see because the pharisee ain't fair you see right they're always betting but budding and they butted heads with jesus didn't the pharisees constantly talk to him and accuse him of this and the disciples don't wash their head but they don't wash their hands but they eat corn in them on sunday and then they always catch him in his words and ask him if i know but what about this and the woman in the very act but what about this but but but but goats are really good at buddies and you know what that tells me what that tells me is that a goat doesn't need a shepherd and he always has his own ideas in his own thoughts that he wants to implement huh goats want to implement their own ideas huh that's right that's why they always butt but what about this and but what a quick forget don't don't don't don't go there right don't even don't even start because god don't need to implement your ideas he has a certain way when you find somebody that always questioning things and never happy with anything and hey what about this and what about that you know watch out amen we've got the plan i mean as we got the plan we got the word of god we got the message of the hour we know what to go by there's no question about it okay but now the point i want to make here is and he shall separate them notice how he talks about he calls them sheep and goats so all the nations and everybody he classes everybody as either a sheep or a goat it's quite something man you're either a sheep or you're a goat and a sh and a goat can amen praise the lord he can shout he can enjoy the blessings of god he can bleach just like a sheep huh sound just like a sheep how do you tell i go to work with him once huh watch his nature watch his natures see how he acts all the time see what's way down in there huh and let me show you can i tell you how else to tell a sheep from a goat let's read a little further you'll see now i want to kind of quiz you tonight a little bit and he shall set the sheep on his right hand remember sheep are always on the right side and the goats are always on the left that's right notice and then shall the king say unto them that is on the right come he blessed of my father inherit the kingdom i was prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was a hunger then you gave me meat i was thirsty and he gave me drink i was a stranger you took me in naked and he closed me and i was sick and he visited me and i was in prison and you came unto me and the righteous answer says when did we ever see you hungry thirsty just out of the other and then the same way to the uh he said the same thing to the goats depart you from into everlasting uh fire because i was hungry i was thirsty i was naked i would never visit so now the question tonight is what is it that sheep always do okay the thing that sheep always do and the condition of the people that they did it to that's the big quiz question what was the condition of the people that they did it to and the answer is these people were people that were down huh they were hungry they didn't have clothes they were strange no place to sleep they were in prison they they needed clothes they were always knee was always a need it was always they were down so if you want to know if somebody should not get down one time really good and see what somebody does to you when you're down and that tells you who they are huh it tells you who you are do you help people when they're in need or don't you is that good that's the truth ain't it we're all in need amen and on that side how many notes it made a big difference god sees those things how many knows god sees those things just like the good samaritan now how many knows that jesus didn't come for the samaritans jesus i came not but for the the lost sheep of the house of israel but yet he gave us the example of a man that was bruised and beat and robbed and everything else and every maybe all the jews the priests all them guys they just went on by i don't want to deal with that guy huh but the samaritan he picked him up wounded him up put him put they took him to the doctor and that right put him up and he's the one that got the credit right he's the one that will be remembered so we look at the importance of sheep and goats how many knows that are sheep we as sheep are absolutely we have to have a shepherd we have to have a leader i have got to have a leader amen and while it's true that your pastor is your leader but the real leader is the holy ghost how many knows let me say something else i'm going to say this because i thought about it today because if your leader if your shepherd isn't following the great shepherd what's going to happen you're going to fall in the ditch right it's not going to turn all right if your shepherd is not following the great chapter it's all going to come not amen you're going to be disappointed so it's important that a pastor is in the will of god that he is following the great shepherd because if he's not you're in trouble but i'm so thankful aren't you glad for that now there's so many different things here now i want to let me just go to one of them right off the go get in verse 27 great shepherd says this my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me over in verse chapter 10 if you have your bible say i want to go with me chapter 10 verse 2. but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice okay both times here jesus is talking about how that the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and he leadeth them out again verse 4 has to do with hearing his voice and when he put his forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice boy i'm here to tell you right [Applause] as now shepherd that it is 100 imperative that you know the voice of god because how many knows there are a lot of voices in this world let me say something else tonight if you write this down in your little book that the voices that you listen to creates your whole entire world that's right it creates your whole entire world whether it's listening to your pastor whether it's listening to other people or whether it's listening to the voice in your head [Applause] huh folks a lot of times we have a lot of voices come in our head we have a lot of thoughts coming in our head amen and let me say that it's imperative that you know which one is the i have young people i have different people people listening out here it's important that you know what the voice of god is because if you don't you're not fitting in with these scriptures but this scripture says my sheep they know my voice and i think most of us can admit most of us can admit that when we listen to tapes when we listen to brother branham it was something about that voice but in the days of the voice of the summoned angel when he shall begin to sound right somebody's going to hear his voice it's about that voice you recognize there's something about that voice just like with jesus they said he spoke he didn't speak like the pharisees and the priests but he spoke with authority he knew what he was talking about that's the way the prophet was he knew what he was talking about and he never had to back up that right so let me just say that that it's important that you know the holy spirit's voice amen one thing i listened i listened to a couple of brother band messages on a shepherd and so forth and the one thing that he said that i i really liked he talks about that when you come in that door okay when you come into the door the sheep falls forth i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pastor amen so once you're in christ once you come inside that door how many knows that's when you are safe you are safe because i looked up on syria and so forth and i wasn't on syria it was on my search program and one of the last things it talked about and i took a picture of it was about a shepherd and bought four different things and four major things that a shepherd does is protect okay protect from the danger protect from wolves protect and protect and then the other thing is that he feeds them and he leads them all right those are two other things he feeds the sheep he leads the sheep but a lot of it is about protection and as the prophet of god said there ain't no sickness there ain't nothing that can come on you unless he comes across jesus first because you're in there huh what evidence he makes a statement and makes a point that whatever does come upon you it is god allowing it to give you a testimony to try you or whatever it might be right something that god has allowed but it can't just come in there any other way amen and doing the devil can't touch you without having god's permission isn't that good to know that you're under the protection of god once you come inside the shepherd's door nothing can harm you i believe david said i will not fear though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death for thou art with me fears nothing aren't you glad for that my sheep hear my voice amen say it came to my mind and that is that you have to keep calm how many sheep have to stay calm you get a bunch of sheep riled up they run every direction and then it'll be chaos keep the sheep calm wolf what he does he gets the sheep all disturbed gets it all everybody all riled up and disturbed huh how many knows that's my job my job is to say no just calm down huh stop what you're doing huh and to watch out for the sheep all right so i like this other scripture that i ran into in verse 16 of chapter 10 if you're with me and other sheep have i aren't you glad you had some more sheep he said i've got some more sheep which are not of this fold in other words you'll come at another time right them also most i bring and they shall hear my voice [Applause] aren't you glad it's not maybe if you are part of those sheep that was you know enter into the kingdom of heaven that was prepared for you from the foundation of the world right if you are a part of those sheep you will hear his voice amen and there shall be one fold and one shepherd praise be to god amen next i want to go to david i want to talk about shepherd david and shepherd moses psalms 23 david says the lord is my shepherd i shall not won't what is that i shall not need of anything i shall not lack how many believe that a shepherd supplies for his sheep buddy i tell you what i preached it a million times and i want to just say it again i thank god that he is our provider he provides for us he really does i'm thankful that he provides for us whatever you have need of he's going to see to it that you get it how many believes he has supplied all the food that we need to eat to be spiritually on hallelujah avenue and amen corner amen hallelujah that you might be spiritually fed he supplied it he has a supplied every piece of equipment that you need to fight the devil with in the world and in the age that we live in isn't it something just come to thought how did brother brahm talk about how that you know this is the age and all the prophets and even himself if he has been back on the eons of time and god would ask him what age do you want to be in what was his answer it had been right here at the end he said this is this is the time the most wicked as horrible as eight but this is the time you wanna do that [Applause] amen so i wanna tonight you're living in the most glorious age out of all the choice ages until for you to live you gotta pick the best one for you no i don't believe we're gonna be dragged out there and tied to a pole and a big bunch of wood set on fire and our skin melt right off of us until we die huh no not burned at the stake fed the lions and so forth you gotta fight this lukewarmness you gotta fight this rich layout to see a h that wants to consume all your time that you don't have any time for god bam the devil got you right there if you ain't got time for god the devil's got you you don't redeem the time say look i'm going to make time for god huh that was god for you oh my could go a long ways down there right the lord is my shepherd my i shall not walk now you know david knew what it was like to be a shepherd he knew what it was like to lay down his life for the sheep that's how serious david was about his sheep just one little sheep maybe one little lamb all right the lion got it in his mouth and carried it off david said you give me back my little sheep you give me back my little lamb went after him killed that lion in the same way with the bear if it was going to cost him his life he was going to get it back but there's something down in here huh i imagine he said a prayer don't you just like he said to goliath before before he met him he said you come to me with a sword and spear but i come to you in the name of the law right i ain't i ain't coming by myself and if you would just open your eyes right now i've got to open your eyes like he did to his eye elijah's servant and see the angels that's around here with drawn swords you would drop your sword and cry like a baby and run the other way because you know he was going to lose and david knew who was with him how many is glad that he's with you i'm glad that he's with me all right he maketh me to lie down in green pastures amen he leadeth me besides still waters oh my i mean say i love those places that's peaceful oh i've got peace like a river i got peace like a river huh just flowing all over me my cup is full and running over he knew what it was like to be in a peaceful nice wonderful place but we're going to talk about leadership for a while all right he leadeth me not isn't that what a shepherd does he leadeth us he leads us he leadeth me he leadeth me amen besides still waters he restoreth my soul again he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name state every one of us has to realize that that's what god is doing with us every single day is trying to lead us into greater righteousness or have you reached that place already you don't need to go any more no i think we all could say i need to get a little bit deeper in his righteousness oh yeah and here you want to stop here for a little bit yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thyroid and thy staff they comfort me this valley of the shadow of death according to the prophet it's not some valley of dying but he says this is the valley of death right here it has a shadow in it is it the shadow of death right here because as much as life as he can have there's a shadow of death if you got eternal life you're never going gonna die this man down on the inside of his body here never gonna die how many knows when you take that last breath you step right over into another body and continue right on this body is that shadow it has death in it and though i walk through this world so to speak i will fear some evil no i will fear no evil for thou art with me i want to say i highly doubt that david experienced fear going after that bear or going after that line because you can't have fear and faith at the same time you can't do much there's a lot of people that can do a lot of that because they're scared to death but not in david's case he had perfect confidence that god was going to take care of him how many is he like that tonight perfect confidence that god is going to take care of me and you know david and the leadership of the holy ghost isn't always in green pastures not always by still waters amen as the song says in grady and grady and shady green pastures so rich and so sweet god leads his dear children along huh before the waters cool flow bathes the weary one's feet oh he's so sweet sometimes god leads his dear children along but some he leaps through the waters some may lead through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood some through great sorrow but god gives a song in the night seasons and all the day long david david's men after saul tried to spear him to the wall with his spirit time or two he decided it was time for him to hit the road so he hid the road but somehow or other this evil spirit that got on saul wasn't happy with david being gone he went after him he wanted to kill the guy right and things got pretty hectic for david for quite a while and he had come to find out there's many a man many of men that joined up with david and they're right and so not david had to shepherd all of these men because david was following the great shepherd how many knows god was his shepherd and he knew it but it came to pass one time many times god led david put a deep sleep on saul to where i believe it was david walked right down into the camp and took a piece of cloth and cut it off of david's coat not david but saw his coat went up on the hill and this i believe in the bible happened twice the first time he says you are a man better than me and and you go on your way but then he got his bad attitude back again went after him again several times got delivered saw it into david's hand but he would not touch god's anointed huh isn't that right i believe it's david saul david's armor bearer somebody yelled down there to to or was it david that yelled saul's armor bear and his protector he says you deserve to die because you let somebody come into the camp and do that to your master you deserve to die somebody touched the anointed of the lord amen and just because god had ordained him he was the king of israel okay we wouldn't go kill him but anyway many times sweet wonderful victories he escaped many times but one time he knew what it was like to be led through great sorrow and it came to pass when david and his men would come to ziglag on the third day that the amalekites i know the zig lag is where david was staying with all of his men the malachites had invaded the south and ziglag was and smit smitten zig lag and burnt it with fire and had taken the women captive that were therein and they slew not any neither great or small but carried them all away and went their way so david and his men came to this city and behold it was burnt with fire huh can you imagine coming home and everything burnt in anybody's mind you would think that everybody's dead if they're going to burn the whole city down they're very capable of church it's about killing anybody right so there you are wondering if there's anybody alive you come back and your heart drops out of your chest you have no more strength perhaps you know we can go through things that make us so weak you just drop down on your knees you can't even stand anymore seeing people do it all right david and his men came to the city and behold he was burnt with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives and david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power too weak huh some through great sorrow and david's two wives were taken captive i hate oh i can't explain ahem and just the jezreelites and abigail the wife of nabal and david was greatly distressed people for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all men oh no the soul of all the people was grieved for every man for his sons and his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord there was talk of them killing him let me tell you at this time these men did not have much for david's leadership why because things have went so wrong no promise of seeing your children hello don't we love our children our wives and our children all gone how could something this terrible happen we ask that a lot of times don't we how can something this terrible happen god allows it because listen god isn't isn't in just into taking care of the sheep and and making everything green pastures and nice and soft and comfortable he's also training sons and daughters how many he's in the business of training us amen and i think there's a lot to be said that in our hearts we're to have the nature every bit of it the nature of a sheep meek and lowly like jesus was i know jesus was the lamb of god that took away the word he was meek and lowly that's the way we're supposed to be meek readily to follow the word ready to follow christ amen at the same time really to follow him no matter where he leads no matter through what he leads where he leads me i will follow i want to sing that maybe here yet where he leads me i will follow hey we got our whole future head i mean believe that you got your whole future head we don't know what's going to happen yet but whatever happens as long as he's with us we're all right aren't you glad of that greatly distressed he encouraged himself in the lord he is god and david said to i bethar he the priest a himalayan son i pray thee bring me hither and ephod and apathar brought thither the ephod to david and david inquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them oh i imagine jesus david has some serious ants questions for the lord don't you think are we ever going to see our wives are we ever going to see our family again i don't know lord please give me an answer please tell me what should i do shall i pursue him can i overtake him and he answered i like that i mean please just listen to that still small voice how many please it never leads you wrong you'll know when it's the right voice god will always tell you to do good thing the right thing he'll tell you he'll never tell you to do wrong and he said pursue i like it david's heart was going to come back into his chest he's going to receive strength in his veins and arms and legs again because at this point i highly doubt he had much strength in any part of his body and neither did his men pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them amen well that's good i'm glad we're going to catch up with them all right now i know that much but the best is yet to come and without fail recover oh i like those without fail and recover all don't you you're going to without fail recover a double l he could go back to his men and say look the lord told me that we're going to go pursue him yeah the house is going to be rebuilt all of that there life can't be given back if it's taken perhaps you can't if god wants to but listen we're going to have all our wife we're going to get all our kids back amen what a shepherd david inquired amen he was following the great shepherd and he got everything back that he lost he went he pursued they all got it back i'll tell you what no matter where god leads you god will never lead you into any place that he can't keep you aren't you glad for that that's if you are a sheep this does not go this does not apply to goats no the goats don't want to follow huh how many knows most of israel was goats and following moses most of israel was goats they could never just submit themselves i mean after everything that god did with moses in egypt there shouldn't have been one israelite and they have any question that moses was god's man that he was their shepherd that he was going to lead him out because god had told moses go down there lead my people out that right but they did they constantly questioned it constantly wondered well i don't know for sure you boy it seems like god would just make it all easy and all nice but he doesn't i mean it was that that doesn't make it all nina easy nice and as i was thinking about trials and preaching on trials a lot i wanted to make this statement folks i don't know about you but i've had enough trials to last me last time i'm good i'm good i don't ask for any more trials i don't hope a whole lot of trials come my way especially not ones i've passed in the past i mean passing the back i don't want to do it again amen i know that god will send some i don't know just what and where but god will keep working on us he will but i do believe that i do believe that when you pass tests and when you come to a certain level god eases up on you huh i believe it amen because once you're an obedient child and he's you've got to where you need to go you don't need to go back to eighth grade you don't need to go back to high school amen now you need to learn deeper things amen but we're always learning how to believe that we're always learning god is always teaching us new things how to be more surrendered to god amen all a lot of things but moses let's talk about him for just a few minutes moses shepherd moses finally got the sheep together and there was a bunch of them two million sheep let them out when finally come down to where pharaoh just said let's go just eat everything and leave all of the guards stood back no more guarding a man no more you can't go out or we'll kill you everybody went back just go on everybody could go out free they got everything they could imagine and all of the egyptians say so much knew that god was with them that they were good to them give them tools and gold and everything else empty their jewelry boxes and give it to them hey here you know take this let this help you you're real generous basically swallowed the egyptian took off praising the lord and hallelujah glory to god oh they were having a time weren't they until it came to the water amen some through the water some through the flood from what i understand it was flood time right amen to come up to the red sea there it was flood time and come down there and even the shepherd didn't know what to do even he was baffled even he began to cry out oh what am i gonna do what are we gonna do and that's probably good put it god kind of rebuked him and that right got finished with his crying and his whining look who's leading you look who's with you i'm no need to whine and cry look who's with you amen rely on him how many believes that god loves to bring us to places to we can't get over under around it then he can be our shepherd then he can lead us because i'm here to tell you we as human beings we are programmed to do it ourself i can do this i can do this god has to bring us to a place to where no you can't no no no it doesn't go you oh boy i'll tell you just when we really find out what we're made of when it doesn't go the way you think it ought to go not the way you want it to go and there ain't nothing you can do about it then we find out if your hair stays straight up and your face get puffs up and you get angry like a toad ball frog eating buckshot why because you want to do it we all want to do it i'm going to make this happen no no no no folks sometimes when we get that way to god he'll just he'll make it that much worse for us it'll just get worse yeah to get you down to make you realize you're not going to do this oh my i know all about it get down on your knees and let god do it start relying on god start following him how many times my they follow me they follow me they follow me every time jesus said my sheep follow me they don't guide me they don't get ahead of me and i'm told that whenever there's two shepherds maybe side by side or whatever every one of those sheep of that pastor that shepherd they know the shepherd's voice and another shepherd can make the same sound they don't even listen to it it ain't got the right sound huh that's where sometimes sheep and churches man they'll get to say well brother donnie's said this or this one said that hey no two people are going to see the light so don't go listen too many voices you'll get confused huh on certain things anyway that's right don't you just develop the just love when somebody comes to me now brother why don't i disagree with you on this because somebody else said this well then why do you ain't in their church i don't care what they said you know if i'm following the scriptures not following the holy spirit that's what i'm that's what i do he does the same thing amen all right my sheep but isn't it wonderful isn't it wonderful that moses had a shepherd moses was following the great shepherd and when he said what am i going to do what did god he responded how many beliefs that god's going to respond to your situation if you have him as your leader he will respond to your situation if you have faith in him and believe him and trust him and commit yourself to him he will lead you out he will lead you through folks he'll bust the world down to get you through he's not going to get you up against a rock and a hard place not to be able to get you through that amen oh my i'm so thankful for that and folks i'm here to tell you we in this generation are between a rock and a hard place amen brother jerry browning i believe i've preached for him one time he always mentions brother i'll never forget that sermon you preached on there and i said what in the world did i preach he says between a rock and a hard place yeah god brings you to that rock place but listen it's amazing how he'll take you over it now even the prophet of god said the same thing he says that's one of the greatest miracles he's ever had that he has ever seen when he couldn't get over it he couldn't get under he can't get around it and then just watch just trust in him and watch him open that door he will put a hole in that rock wall like you ain't never seen huh didn't he for israel god leads his children along he opened up the waters even they made songs and and stuff about how did he dried up the muddy waters the ground under can you imagine how muddy that was that had to be a muddle and he dried it to where they could drive horses and chairs right across there walk right across there i don't know about you but i want to see the video i want to see the playback of them guys walking through that red sea huh and i want to see the great big walls how high they were perhaps watch the wind come down and just dry that right up you know because god doesn't need 24 hours to dry it up do you think no when every fever blows a little bit it just hardens right up huh you're ready to go and the coach thought they could do the same thing hey i can get on that mud i can make it across there but their wheels started to bog down that mud got soft again and they bogged down couldn't get through and suck water into their lungs every last one until they were dead that's right that one their daughters took their men and made servants out of them and beat them and treated them like a bunch of slaves israel didn't feel too bad about him they got up on the dancing one day would dance in the spirit they're all dead glory we slaves to them the more folks how many knows when god leads you out of sin delivers you from this that or the other you can rejoice say thank you lord hallelujah thank you that that thing is dead to me now aren't you thankful for a shepherd like that god leads us along no matter what it doesn't always look good doesn't always look green pastures and so forth but boy aren't you glad for the green pastures the peace oh my when they get on the other side that peace that comes with it amen one time after another one time after another but we got to be joshua's and we got to be caleb's isn't that right and they came back from jericho and searching out the land and they seen these races on top of jericho and giants in the land and a lot of them says we can't never do it smack him don't you never say i can't do it when god's with you why joshua and caleb had to jump up on the pedestals and steal the people huh quiet no don't listen to all of that you're listening to the wrong voice that's not the voice you want to listen to folks if you don't remember anything else from tonight remember this be very careful what voice you listen to be very careful because you're going to follow a voice amen and that voice is either or it's the wrong voice and boy i'll tell you what most of us that's got great hair know that it doesn't pay to follow the wrong voice and it does pay to follow the right voice amen you love him tonight so no matter whether it's waters or flood or fire or great sorrow
