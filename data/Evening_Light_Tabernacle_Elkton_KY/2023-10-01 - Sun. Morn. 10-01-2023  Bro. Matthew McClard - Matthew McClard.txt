========================================

that that spiritual warfare the spoken word The Original Seed the seed of discrepancy Jesus Christ said that we believe it we can receive it we are free right now not going to be we're already free that's been the name of the Lord you know we're the bride of Christ you know what like I put up there you know this manner from Heaven the message of the hours Jesus Christ ain't coming he's all right already here he's here today whatever you have need of he's here hallelujah man he's living through US fleshly Hearts he's living out through us we're walking talking written Epistles red ball men that's Jesus Christ Living Through us are we his hands eyes ears and feet all that he can do is get himself more Victory through us that should be his name Lord I just love the Lord I Just Want To Praise His Name you know man gets me all pumped up thinking about him man he's so good to me you know I said let us not let it become common to us that you know he's passing our way you know and I had to write this all down because I can get I'm already winging it right now but if I get I'm trying not to go too long you know I'm trying to keep it on track here but you know the Lord you know he was dealing with me you know we don't want to let things come coming to us you know and all that we do you know you know like I told Brother Josh you know I said I was reading Psalms 91 every day there for a long time and then I don't know that song thou Lord or uh shield for me and you know and I hadn't opened the Bible one day and it was Psalms three and it was that very song that I was singing all the time and I started reading that every day foreign you know and and I put it down here a little bit in Psalms 3 it says uh but thou Lord all right my shield for my glory the lifter in my head I cried on the Lord with my voice he heard me out of his holy hell Salah I laid me down and slept and the Lord sustained me you know and I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people but let me say this is spiritual warfare raging the devil hates me I hate him and it don't matter how many he's against me the Lord God's with me Ain't Nothing Gonna hinder me you know you know what you know what the devil child do you know he couldn't come get me with the aorta or oxygen or a heart problem or nothing like that because Jesus Christ unhealed me it's already done but me and Tammy weighed out my propane tanks and one night I cooked one meal next morning I woke up going fired up and through the night it was getting really cold I'd fire up my rope my other big propane tank fire it up and uh uh you know throughout the night I woke up the next morning gonna fire up my coffee propane tank was empty so what did the Lord do he sustained me all through the night I must have sit there and breathe that propane and how much when I lit up the other propane thank you you know how they do that anyway if the room was filled what it was a lord sustaining me I believe that was a scripture he laid on my heart to keep reading and believing it because he's with me even in me to the end of the world oh I just love him he's so rich in Mercy but think about it he says I laid me down and slip and the Lord sustained me he kept me when they try to come and try to get you when you can't see you got a protection he's got my six he's going with me possibly the name of the Lord my goodness he's so good to us ain't he and I said I just wanted to uh I said thank you for a second let's just think for a second here what are we here for you know I was I was just I really got to really thinking on this what are we here for are we here to live and die and be a bump on the log and go through the motions and just uh come and go and go to heaven go to hell go to some fairytale line I don't think so we're in a spiritual warfare we're Sons and Daughters of God Jesus Christ wants to live through us we are we doing our vessels to him to get himself more glory and iron praise due to his name blessed be the name of the Lord we're the body of Christ this is what it says Gibson Collins are without repentance what whoa you know what we might not be gifted to be Pastor preachers singers it don't matter but guess what we're called out people we hear the message of our the Manna From Heaven Jesus Christ is here if that is it is that a gift if we're wanting a million is that a gift more than more than conquerors we're we're the body of Christ think about it for a second when you just stop and think we're the highest up is you can be in God's Army right now [Applause] I don't know what you came here to do but I can't praise the Lord we're in spiritual warfare it's your time right now this is when we come to battle we come you know they would go kill Philistines and Army and battle them battle that's what we're doing right now stand for Jesus Christ clap your hands praise the Lord giving amen give him a shout but be the name of the Lord glory to God just get me all fired up inside thinking about him I said there was a day there I just opened my Bible I don't know how I know I know at least five times and I've opened it a couple times since then and the Lord put me I just you ever do it just just because of the way you got Lord open the Bible five times it landed me on the very last chapter in Ecclesiastes and he said fear God keep my Commandments that's the whole duty of mine I just love that I open it again well I came to one time the one day this one person share here and wrap it up here sorry taking so long but uh I came to the it's just I thought it was just so ironic you know that day this is where I'm going all right so I wanted to share this because you know has re-fired me up it beat me down but it brought me back up God works all things for the good you know I said when the Lord comes knocking we don't want to miss it so today if he comes knocking at your horse door or if he starts dealing with you don't ignore it don't let it become common to us that's what that's what you know because you know I said there was a day there I went and had cold plunge then I I was just having a time with the Lord this morning I overslept and I'm like you know what so I just start praising God always playing a little bit of music listening to some sermons just having Church me and the Lord and I went down I was coming back down the road there on the four-wheeler and just something dropped down my the same voice that said why don't you fast today and I sit there and reasoned it out you know you know I was like was that me yeah I can't pass today I thought to myself I gotta hike all these mountains you know I can't be passing today but you know I went on and when I found my I came back I'm like Lord I'm really I just think I need something from me I opened the Bible and then I flip back one page just so ironically I flip back one page he said eat that bread and drink that wine I was thinking of wine the Holy Spirit stimulation of Revelation blessed to be the name of the Lord okay so I went on it restored my joy okay maybe that was just me making that up in my head well I went on and then I realized you know that same voice I went back to the day right there I was sitting over there the same voice came to me once you quit smoking today I said I can't quit smoking today I'm going to Papa's everybody at my papa smokes and he said why don't you hang out with like faith I said I will 19 years I've never smoked a cigarette again never know tobacco products again but right there that boys blessed be the name of the Lord that same voice told me I was going to be healed I believe I'm Healed that same voice came to me when I was sitting there in my living room when the doctor told me I need to get checked for sleep apnea he said and I was sitting there about two weeks later he said that same boy said Do you believe the same I said man I need to go get checked out I guess he said you believe that same God healed Jay Ordo heal your sleep apne I do blessed be the name of the Lord was healed and then then that same voice when I had a buddy of mine coming up just a little bit ago I forgot about that but uh uh a buddy of mine struggling with drugs and stuff and I said why don't we just we can get together create an atmosphere you know I told you all that testimony and he ended up flaking on me but the Lord came and said what about me and you and I said okay let's go you know and we did it and by God's grace they told me I'd never be medication free and I'm like 9 10 months now completely medication free because the Lord God Is A Healer he is the same yesterday today and forever and I just love the Lord you know must be his name and I just don't believe there's anything that could hinder us you know and it was very discouraging because here this is what this is why I say it you know and God works all things together for the good and there's no retreat in God's Army we're only pressing forward I was very discouraged like thinking man what could have been the Lord come knocking like that what in the world you never know man you could broke out speaking in tongues you could have just had and you know I've been praying for just a closer walk with thee Oh Lord and who knows what could have happened and that's the moral of the story is what if he comes knocking today don't leave here thinking what could have happened should have happened you know he's here to set you free he's here to heal your body he's healed to give you a Revival no matter what you have need of he's here so we came to Worship the Lord and spirit and truth and magnify his great name because he's worthy to be praised you know and uh I guess we all we're gonna sing a special we're gonna have any other magician during my solo and this whole deal y'all want the musicians y'all want to come and play with me we're gonna have some fun look I just seen uh they've done a song service out there brother Donnie's you know boy got the scene they was singing and got the sharing and stuff and this and that and he's like you know he said uh he said can we we start church early tomorrow he said I love this I don't want to leave you know what would come for we ain't no hurry or we can't even magnify the King of Kings he's worthy to be praised don't need to get you fired up man he's good let's Place him crazy well there you can put Here I Am to Worship up and then I'm gonna try to I'm not I'm not a singer so anybody out here that wasn't here before I didn't said I ain't no singer when I got out of the hospital uh I gave up Instagram and all that and started picking a little bit and all I said wouldn't make a Joyful Noise and if I can get up here you know anybody can I've been telling Tammy you know he's worthy to be praised we can take all these fears I thought you know it'd be nice for us all to just everybody that's nervous and scared we can smash all that well get up here at the same time because then guess what we ain't got nothing to be scared about no more then we can just praise him and not have to worry about it man because you know I get nervous too it's like when when we can break into that channel where we can just be ourself be who we are you know when you're by yourself with you and him we could be that right now Lord help us help us you know that we can get back to you what he's gave to us his Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound oh my God I said you know we can it's not every day you can just be a fool for Christ well I I had to hit my nose too I don't think I said that but uh

prayers change things let me move on let me get to my message let me get back to the Bible to my message verse 14. into our place this is the title we're taking this morning I believe we're coming into our place I believe it's bride how many believes this bride's coming together it's it's time for this bride to come together come on now it's time for us to come together we need one another there ain't no schisms no divisions in the body we need every one of you because I can't leave without you and you can't leave without me verse 14 in whom we have Redemption through his blood you know we could not be in our place today and he wouldn't have taken our place oh Hallelujah think about it this morning there's no way for you to be in this place this morning and what was Redemption for to bring you back into your rightful position back to the mind of God back before the foundation of the world that's where we're coming today when the sons and daughters Dance for Joy I believe we're starting to see the sons and daughters start shouting and dancing for joy why because they're coming into their place because they've come under the blood of Jesus Christ and the blood of Jesus Christ has translated them and absolutely changed their lives what was it now the mind of God is not just the mind of God you're looking at the bearing Mind Of God made manifest in this hour under the message of God man that's good that is good buddy [Music] let me read this out he took your place think about it this morning he said but Matt there's no way I can make it yes there is there's somebody that already paid the price he said but Matt there's convictions too heavy well Matt this burden is too hard well the madness is running my family for years and years and years I don't care if it's running around your family I don't care if it's been manifesting your life you've come into the presence where all things begin to change and under this presence you leave out here different this is my daughter we're in a meeting in TWC honey I'm gonna use you she's literally stand up right there honey I'm gonna make you stand yeah I know she shakes my head that's my daughter right there you can see that they're bad she went through a prayer line in twt the minister began to call things out in her life and making it to her let it go I had to change how I treated her because she was so different on the car ride home yeah I was waiting for a 13 year old rebuttal okay Dad that she was bad but she just had her opinion that had to be heard always I know I'm sorry honey she won't kill me she's like pick on Christian next time I'm nasty honey has God changed your life who was it that did it was the preacher no it was God stepped in your life to the point I was amazed I looked at my wife the preacher told me how service he goes you're going home with a new girl I didn't realize how new she was going to be but listen that's not just for her that's for anybody that's sitting under the auspices hearing the voice of God speak to your heart that blood of Jesus listen remember say this he said he took my place he said I had my right to go nowhere I had not a right to go nowhere but to hell but he took my place thank you he Lifted Me Up From Hell he went there for me he Lifted Me Up by his grace and abundance until now we are Sons and Daughters of God and we're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus ever rejoicing remembering him the rod is safe thus far if he's what you say this hard he said but I'm pretty stale this morning well I'm sorry to say I'm not sorry to say I'm glad to say you're not going to leave the same way you came in remember how's it what's going to happen like let's listen the word is already working in your life I'm the type of believer but by the spoken word there's things that are beginning to change devils are kicked out of your life doubts are beginning to fade away why because now you're in the presence of all things are possible why it's not the presence of brother Matt but the one and only Lord Jesus Christ is step down in the building this morning to let his people know I'm with you I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you my grace is sufficient this morning Mercy is here to relax your life I'm going to use a fresh baptism well it's yours this morning it's yours this morning Hallelujah I mean wants to speak in tongues this morning I'm just saying if it's in the Bible I'm not saying that back I'm speaking in tongues I'm not saying how many wants to shout how many wants a victory how many wants to see God move in your life listen it's more than just emotion though how many wants to leave out of here was something you know will never be taken from you your shout might go your dance might get a little little sail but there will still be a burning fire in your deepest day and darkest way I'm gonna praise my Lord I'm in the deepest darkest place but I'm gonna lift my hands and thank him for where he's brought me what he's done for me and what he's going to do for me because if he started this work he's still faithful he's still faithful I know we're sitting in a church with genuine needs we all come to church with genuine needs he stepped in the hospital this morning right get the infusion get the inoculation get the medicine get the gospel and it'll change you now listen he gave us the blood but the blood must be in its place too listen this message came from Moses and he told him he said you go get a lamb well Glory you got something to do it doesn't just wrestling brother Byron gets heavy sometimes anybody you got something to do but that's not just him you got an obligation to pray for that man how many of us have good services how many wants to have just man brother preached like he never preached before well how many is willing to sacrifice a little time and go to pray that then [Applause] I got a fish there come on now I'm gonna lose brother by is the one sits in the stairs Rich to you guys but let's get behind him well Matthew brother tell you that no it's time for the body to come together I can't do very much and I know some of your sisters think you can't do very much listen your prayers

me this morning I got up man it's not near as bad as it was last night my wife goes yeah I've been praying for you [Music] my brother listen Moses gave the message but it took somebody to carry the message out well Glory come on now listen brother Brandon gave the message and he took that blood and he made it the token the baptism of the Holy Ghost then it takes somebody to get down and say father I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I don't need it just on the inside so nobody else could see I'd need it so when they go Bobby that don't rub off on me I Rebels on them [Applause] how he's ever walked with a glass and somebody bump into you if it's half full nothing comes out but when that baby's full it begins to spill out he said but but I'm half full I'm not really full right now listen it bumps out of you you bump into people in the world and I'll tell you what it is oh let the Holy Ghost go on there man it's time for them to stop rubbing off on us it's time we start rubbing off on them [Music] Hallelujah you love him listen we've had a lot of mechanics but I'm talking about Dynamics I'm talking about the moving of the bite of Jesus Christ in step with the word on Word Christian Soul why are you sing that song brother brother man because that's what the vision's all of me it's on me in Step Onward Christian sojourn by the random saw that vision of the Bride coming forth what was the song that was played on what Christian Soldier he's talking to soldiers this morning that you've laid down he let the devil take your land but I say today pick up your sword pick up your shield and go take back what the devil saw from you hello Soldier come on Christian come on evening life let's go you think Tommy was excited I'm excited Glory that's my buddy right there listen we must put the blood on display this token must be on display he said but man I don't really see it in my life well don't be satisfied with that then you don't have to be satisfied that because that's not what's been preached over you that's not what the message of the hour preached over you that you get a feeling of the Holy Ghost and you sit down and become a mob on a log said he'd be judged for what you've done with it well Glory what can I do brother Matt go read the book because thou kids believe all things are possible step on serpents cashed out devils my hands on the sick and they shall recover Hallelujah speak to your Mountain you know that speaks to the mountain that's to you that's your scripture because you've been empowered from on high with a third pole Ministry that now you can speak to your Mountain [Applause] Lord as we read on down here 's the head of the body you know I was driving down it's probably a year year and a half I was driving down the road and brother Brandon would say this quote right here let me read this quote before I go on this I remember say this quote hold on this man let me finish that until he has the preeminence he has the premise to hold the first place listen we must put Christ in his place in your life personally he must be your head he must be your leadership that means when you're mad you're able to take your mat and say father the Bible says to be angry and sin not so I'm not going to open my mouth even though I gotta walk away why because you know you he says one more word well come on where's all your halos I drove here I know what I said on the way I'm doing idiot brother brother you all pay for me never done that go ahead let Christ be the head Christ be over the fathership of you let him be your father so that you can be a good good father I mean let's be good Fathers here man you know the best way is look how he fathered you when you needed a spanking he gave it to you but he didn't just leave you there he gave you a hug he said even though you made a mistake I didn't change who you are you're still my boy prodigal son came home where does daddy meet him halfway he was looking for it it didn't change who he was even though he was out there in dirty rotten sin even though his head was in the pigsty it did not change who he was one bit he was still still a son I don't care how far low you got right now let the grace of God meet you halfway you just come running back to God and you watch God meet you halfway you begin to repent say father I'm sorry you know what he's going to say you know what go get a room go get some Authority come on back into the house of God come back into my table come and feast I'm not here to beat you down I'm here to love you I don't know if you know it or not this is a time a prodigal's coming home let's I'll give you another testimony the relative improved said 23 years this guy's sit in a firehouse and he worked in the fire he's been 20 years he said he didn't even have a thought of coming back to God he said he sat down on his desk the spirit Lord spoke him says son time to come home in a boxing sin oh Hallelujah in a backslidden condition not even a thought of serving God the spirit of God went after one of his own you know he's sitting in church not only him but his family [Applause] listen mama I don't care where your kids are at listen Daddy I don't care where your kids are at you keep right on praying God is bringing them back your prayers are answered your prayers are heard but whatever I'm sick and tired of you saying that our prayers aren't heard but I believe there's coming for fruits in the body of Jesus Christ of particles coming on the threefold purpose of God brother remember preaches in Christ the Mr God goes his first Express himself completely in Christ second to have preeminence by this in his church will his body the bride till he could have the preeminence Express himself through them I mean what's God to express himself there's then you let this word have preeminence in your life Let It Be The Lord of your life I know I can't brother man that's right you can't but he can't that's why we come to church because when we can't he came why don't you take I can't brother Matt and say father help me Lord I see it in the word see it in the message but Lord I'm having a hard time walking in it then just be honest and say Lord I need help I don't care how long you've been walking listen some of you where we're gonna preach out some of the older ones have been walking this way a lot and you've grown stale well Glory how many members when you first got saved so oh you need to put this guy to shame come on now What stopped did he stop giving the blessing I'll let that's it you still love me I'm still your buddy I'm an evangelist I just say it like it is no if the spirit of God is speaking to your heart you know what he's doing he's calling you into your place you've grown stale just get a little closer to the fire gotten too busy you ain't had time get a little closer yeah you watch God give you strength to do all things I was thinking I was riding down the road the other day it's been a year and a half ago so I went the other day it was the other day but it's long days away remember I've said this quote it just struck me I was listening to this on the way to church hey you know what when you get in your car you can invite Jesus to come some of you drive a lot press play that's where I agree with it totally it doesn't take the place to the pulpit ever proven by the Bible the prophet's quotebook plain and simple I want to argue that point but God will come anywhere you invite him maybe you work at a factory and your job is to move this part from there to there and it's loud and obnoxious there's a lot of things going on aren't you thankful for your folks plug the world out and begin to talk to the Lord he watched God come down and begin fellowship with you he wants to fellowship with you that's a reason he went to the cross you know I was going down the road and I remember him said this he says great major events happens inhibit before it happens on the earth he reflects himself in other words before Messiah came into into a place where his ministry would start they'll come forth a star out of heaven you know his brother may have said this and immediately struck me the cloud the cloud what was the picture of the cloud I'm gonna give it to you I should have gave it to them in the back so you can see it better but I'll show you guys know what the cloud picture is we're messaging believers that was a cloud right it was Cloud a major event happened in the heavens the world didn't see it and not the same as Jesus the world didn't see it but it came forth that you and I wouldn't understand something oh first of all let me get it right you have to look at it the right way listen saints of God this was the very what what is that picture of is that a picture of brother Brian who's that the image of it was the head coming to the body this would happen in the heavens before brother Brandon preached the seals what was it it was the mind of God Simplicity I'm a simple preacher I can believe this because I can see it Hallelujah all right what was it it was what's in the head the vision what's in the head the mouse Oh Glory what's in the head not your head this is the head of Christ so as I begin to think of that I'm not going to question this message any longer I'm not going to try to figure it out I'm just going to believe it I'm just going to say where the Prophet said I'm looking forward with it why because if God would come and vindicate it if God would come from the heavens and put his seal of approval but the man who would say that cloud did not come for me it came to show that the message is true listen this message must bring us into our place he said come on earn my people it was my people that would see the mind of God and walk in the Liberty that God gave him take this I believe it was a while before he even saw it himself he said you better turn it to the right let's just say to God look at this message the right way look at this message the right way this message is the very image of Jesus Christ it's not a man's idea this was not even brother branham's message when he stepped up there on both my rock and he raised his hand what was it that came into his hand Hallelujah it was not from the brand of Sword it was the king's sword what was the message for quick question the message quit looking at it the wrong way look at it say it's right it's right it's for me it's my headship it's the word of God to me it'll bring you into an anointing it'll bring you into a deeper relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ but I don't understand it all amen I don't either what kind of preacher is he and everything well everyone understands everything I guarantee he's false particulated Hallelujah I don't understand everything that's why God didn't base it on your understanding he said if thou can't believe we walk by what our understanding our sight no we walk by faith and as you continue to walk the light goes out in front of you and the light goes out in front of you and for the next step Oh Glory for the next step he gives you the light to take the next step and we're walking by faith and one of these days we're gonna be like Enoch that next step's not going to be Earthbound any longer that next step's gonna take us on the glory why because I'm not following my mind I'm not looking at my ideas I'm not looking at my passions I did I look into the mind of Jesus Christ what is the Mind reveal it revealed where you came from it reveal where you're going he puts you as a predestinated seat before the foundation of the world coming under the light of Jesus Christ in this hour it becomes quicker that now you manifest the word for your day [Music] and you guys gonna pull me to death don't pull out [Music] I gotta appreciate it you love him this morning so they're looking at the wrong angle you've got to look at the right angle the only Lord God can reveal it which is the right angle turn it to the right and look at it there he is listen brother man I'm going to teach us he said if you don't see Jesus in every scripture read it again listen and you see some man's idea that's all right look at it again Jesus is right there in the midst of it how do you know that he said he would be he said behold I walk in the midst of the seven golden candle sits and I'm here to tell you he's still walking he's still the same he's still in action what does walking represent walking represent action my God's still in action today my God my God's here today my God's here to take you from just like you of the darkness of Doubt of the fear of this world into a glorious relationship [Applause] Barbara Hallelujah subjection Oh my he said that word subjection husbands you have your place right wives huh what Amen brother Tom no wife should have your place my brother man would also say to your husbands you live such a life that your wife would want to be in subjection to you why are you gonna say that brother Matt let's get a balance you live such a life that she say honey what do you think you've been praying about this have you no but I will I'll let you know sorry we do live in a human body we're not perfect [Music] they all pay for me then by the way to say this is this doesn't think you man's field in 1965. this is a mystery how that women should be in respect to their husbands even the second place now let me drop down just like why does a woman every time she gets married put a veil over her face she's coming to her husband the head just so like Rebecca did she put a bail over her face to meet Isaac she's no more head Isaac's her head and the church ought to be so submissive to the word of God yeah all right where's the word of God come from now they don't give brother Thomas the right to preach anything he wants because who's our head hope it's okay buddy when you walk into those doors absolutely to expect I know complacency you talked about it you're so complacent well it's just another Wednesday night Sunday morning let me go do my duty pay my ties and you've lost something somewhere [Applause] you lost your first love I'm not trying to be mean Revelation comes in all kinds of ways it came to David thou art thy man that man but what did David do he came into his place submitted himself man that's good he submitted himself to the word of God come on now if you're wrong this morning I know I'm always wrong foreign yes you are but you get walking out the spoon she takes no thought for herself she has no head Christ is her head not somebody ecclesiastial Bunch but Christ is her head the word and the Word was made flesh into one Among Us and I believe the word is being made flesh and dwelling Among Us Again Hallelujah why because the body of Jesus Christ is coming to a uniting town and the head is coming to the body and when it comes down there's a greater power that comes with it that now you can speak to your Mountain [Applause] how about you say the right thing this morning how do you write what she do when program said the man said she said the right thing makes words when they're out there in that little fishy he goes Banks must have said the right thing how much you say the right thing is Mary did Lord being unto me according to that word father I see where I'm lacking that's all right this morning I mean he didn't give you not the grace to get there he didn't give you the mercy to say come on come on any preacher comes up here and preaches you into hell man you better not have him back I won't preach me into heaven I need Grace without Grace I'd never be in this place in the first space and without Grace I'll never make it but I need Grace this morning that's why he supplies Grace this morning let me throw you

I know speaking to somebody as little Ryan but a body change sounds really good every day I walk to Walmart and I see all kinds of purple hair and Lord help them I sell kinds of purple hair and nose rings and this that and the other Lord have mercy on them because that'd be us if it wasn't for the grace of God but you see Satan be made manifesting people getting in total possession of of sin of Satan but if there's people getting in total possession of Satan then there ought to be people getting total possession of the Holy Ghost and now they can stand at the end time that's not who I am

Moses a farmer I know I was a farmer brother Brandon was a Wilderness man come on he almost left the ministry to go be a Trapper there'll be a guide that's where he wanted to be Jesus left all this he left all of Heaven that at this very moment you could come into your place he became me that I through him might become him let me finish two more two more things that will stop Hebrews chapter six and one it says let us go on unto perfection that word of perfection is sometimes oh my goodness he's going to talk on purpose there's no way I can be perfect yes there is he provided a lamp by the blood of an innocent one there's a Perfection when you go look at that word you know what that word means maturity we still got a lot of babies in their message pews up in there we're still out of babies complaining and whining because it's getting hard but who's in control of this if he brought you there he brought you there for a purpose if he sends you into a valley that means you're coming out of the valley a different person you know where most your growth is done on the mountain brother Matt no naturally you go on the mountains you get up there real high how much green stuff is there not much is there there's a tree line you know that tree line no growth but it's down in that Valley I don't know where you're at but God's telling you I'm in control I know what this Valley is doing to you I know what it's doing to you you know what it's doing how are you matured how was Christ matured suffering maybe you won't raise your hand how may you say oh God I'm suffering right now seems like the worst time I've ever had my God will bring suffering in many different ways but it's really to work on your character and to let you know you have the ability to stand in that mountain and say mountain in the name of Jesus Christ be removed into the sea I believe the word I believe what God says I will not accept doubt I will not accept fear I accept the word of God and even if you're standing there tomorrow I'm going to keep speaking to you and little by little brother I'm saying a little sad and the Brain would leave a little sat in the great maybe you don't see big movement but saints of God we should see maturity in our life there needs to be growing in our life I don't care how long you've been in this message you need to be growing if you're on the face of the Earth your character needs to be growing Embrace that trial Embrace that suffering man I'll tell you what it gives you a whole different aspect instead of getting out of it let me finish one more thing Hallelujah has a lot there Paul matured he said but I speak as a child I thought as a child it's time we start speaking as mature perfect Christians how does the moon how does the maturity happen laying in the presence of the Sun sisters hear Tomatoes what do you do with them you put them in the fridge when they're green just stick around to the counter no you just took him in the window seal and you open it how does it happen brother Matt Supernatural isn't it it isn't what you do get yourself in the light of this message of the hour and watch the Super Natural Light begin to change you

rightful place if you saw Joe there he saw me there this message has become so personal to you it's my message Brethren came for me if nobody else wants it well glory to God you you whatever you want I want it I'll take the saith the Lord Hebrews chapter Ephesians chapter 4 talks about the fivefold ministry he said until we all come into our place the statue of a perfect man you know why they're against my full ministry because the devil is afraid the bride will actually recognize who she is and once you recognize who she is he knows there's no devil in hell there's nothing that he can do and he's scared to death and he's trying to hold you back he's trying to keep you in a place that he's got you beat down he takes your sins he takes your thoughts and he begins to world you listen he's been doing it for many many years but God's so fit to sit you in this age that you can overcome everything of the devil he gave me the Holy Ghost he gave you the message of the hour he gave you an open book this book is not closed amen this is an open book start feeding on the open book Hallelujah but the Rhythm would bring Revelation 10 1-7 and now it's fulfilled but there's more scriptures

here come here raise your hand say Amen reach it buddy good job but there was a mighty angel telling him what to say this was not brother Brandon's message that's why you would make it a seventh grade education that's why you would make it so simple that you die faster than that faster now come on you stay right there they're still abroad and they're still a mighty angel the Bible says you gotta go and take the book keep going buddy don't fall feel bad good sit down what am I here to tell you this morning the mighty Angel's still here Revelations 10 8 9. he said go take the book that's personal

the book type of the Bride look it up go through the message type of the Bride he took the book and what did he do he ate it in his mouth it was sweet bitterness or something let me begin to purge him but then there came a point the mighty angel you've got to prophesy again it must come forth another prophecy and who's it coming from Brother Thomas it's coming from the Bride of Jesus Christ because they're fiend on the right thing come on mature bride but I can never do that start eating the book take it or this is who I am this is my head Holy Ghost is your head but the Holy Ghost got the

let that bother you let's just amen serve the Lord now we want to come to the partner where we want to honor God for what he did and what made all this possible when he went to Calvary isn't that right he asked us to do this as often as you take it in remembrance of me amen and that is to take the communion and foot washing so amen we'll just change the order of the service this morning and so if you will stand with me musicians you can take your seats or stand by your sea tickets amen praise the Lord so glad to be able to do this we know that one of these days it'll be our last service our last communion amen we'll get to see him face to face and we're certainly looking forward to that amen turn your bibles if you will to First Corinthians First Corinthians the 11th chapter amen verse 23 Paul says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he heads up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this New Year is off the street drink it in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink of his cup of the Lord you do show the Lord's death until he come whoever whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthy they shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let the man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that he didn't drink a damnation to him eat and drinketh unworthily eat it and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world whoever my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come will have award a moment of silence so that you can judge yourself and make sure that you confess anything that you've done wrong or whatever make everything right so that you don't come to the Lord's table unworthily so let's bow our heads amen and amen and all those wanting to partake of the communion come over around to the right side his brother William and brother Brad would come up Amen to serve the communion amen and all the rest of you can be seated if you're not taking communion you can be seated [Applause] together is um remember there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from amen [Music] beneath the flood lose all

says now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should be part out of this world having loved out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid inside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he walked pour with water into a basin and began to watch the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh either Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord the Salvage my feet Jesus answers and said unto him I what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him thou shall never wash my feet Jesus answers him if I watched he not thou has no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands in my head Jesus saith to him he that is washed need is not saved and washed his feet but he's clean every wit and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after that he had washed her feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I've been your lord in mass or have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done unto you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not created and he's Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are you if
