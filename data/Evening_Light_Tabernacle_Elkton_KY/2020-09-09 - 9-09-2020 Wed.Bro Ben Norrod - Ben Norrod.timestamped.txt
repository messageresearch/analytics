[44:35] this evening
[44:36] and let's get right into the word of the
[44:38] lord are you excited for the holy spirit
[44:42] amen and jesus good to us hallelujah
[44:45] hebrews chapter 1 verse 6
[44:48] 6 and seven hebrews chapter one verse
[44:52] six
[44:52] and seven i want to speak to you this
[44:54] evening upon
[44:55] a ministry of angels ministry
[44:59] of angels how many believes in the
[45:03] angels of the lord
[45:04] amen well if you don't you've come to
[45:06] pick a good night to be at church
[45:08] because before this so with i will do my
[45:10] best to prove to you that they're not
[45:11] only here for us
[45:12] they're here with us around us and they
[45:14] serve a great purpose in the body of
[45:16] christ
[45:17] for our needs hebrews chapter 1 6
[45:21] and 7. and again when he bringeth in the
[45:24] first begotten
[45:25] into the world he saith and let all the
[45:28] angels of god to him
[45:30] and of the angels he saith who maketh
[45:33] his angels spirits
[45:36] and his ministers a flame
[45:39] of fire now don't say it again ministers
[45:41] a flame
[45:42] of fire his angels spirits and his
[45:45] ministers of flame of fire so flames of
[45:48] fire aren't supposed to just do
[45:49] power points and if they do they should
[45:52] bring their power with their point
[45:55] amen if they're a flame of fire there
[45:57] shouldn't just be a good intellectual
[45:59] talk
[46:00] praise the lord if they are a flame of
[46:02] fire when they come to the pulpit they
[46:04] should
[46:05] fire well it makes sense if the priest
[46:08] went into the
[46:09] temple and he was going to burn the
[46:11] sacrifice up or he was going to
[46:13] light the candles i mean it'd be hard
[46:14] for him to do it walking out of the wet
[46:16] blanket
[46:17] god didn't call you to come to church
[46:18] tonight to listen to a wet blanket god
[46:20] called you to come and listen to flames
[46:22] of fire
[46:23] praise the lord now listen to this out
[46:25] of christ as the mystery just one little
[46:27] snippet here
[46:28] i want you to think about this as we dig
[46:30] into the message tonight
[46:31] brother brandon said in my opinion the
[46:34] first thing
[46:35] that god made was angels
[46:39] it's quite a statement in the first
[46:42] thing he made
[46:44] was angels let's pray together heavenly
[46:47] father what a privilege it is to be in
[46:48] the house of the lord
[46:50] lord jesus we are so grateful
[46:53] for the holy spirit that's amongst us
[46:55] tonight we pray lord that your word will
[46:58] come in such a powerful way
[47:00] lord that it'll be able to bring a
[47:02] change to our everyday lives
[47:04] our hearts our thinking and god may you
[47:06] just sweep us up for a few moments
[47:08] tonight
[47:09] lord jesus carry us away into that
[47:11] eternal place where we can hear from you
[47:14] forgive us of our sins wrongs and
[47:15] transgressions and foolishnesses
[47:18] we pray that the holy ghost will come in
[47:20] such a mighty way
[47:21] into our hearts tonight lord that we
[47:23] will be able to look into the unseen
[47:25] and recognize what's around us tonight
[47:28] as i pray you will bless this word to
[47:30] our
[47:31] souls as we take it into our soul mind
[47:33] body and spirit
[47:34] may we live by may live through us may
[47:36] the holy ghost water tonight
[47:38] this all that's been accomplished all
[47:40] the singing all the music the worship
[47:42] even to the taking of the
[47:43] offering which brother bam talked about
[47:45] being a form of worship
[47:47] lord our clapping of hands are rejoicing
[47:50] lord may every bit of it be to the
[47:52] benefit of the kingdom of god
[47:54] and to our walk with you as we commit
[47:56] this evening to your hands

[48:21] you know you're in a good funeral
[48:22] everybody's crying and sad amen you know
[48:25] how you're doing a good church service
[48:26] everybody's rejoicing
[48:27] amen praising the lord i i like that now
[48:30] now i want to try if the lord will help
[48:32] me now i'm going to watch that clock
[48:34] very carefully tonight because um it'd
[48:36] be easy for me to get carried away on
[48:38] this subject and we'd be here an hour
[48:40] and a half
[48:40] without it without a problem but i'm
[48:42] going to try to just get into the high
[48:44] spots the best i can
[48:46] because there's so much in this that it
[48:49] would be impossible to break it down in
[48:50] one night
[48:51] and and i'm going to try if the lord
[48:53] will help me to get as much of the good
[48:56] meaty parts of this in so that we can
[48:58] understand
[48:59] uh this this unseen world around
[49:02] us and i i believe it's important to
[49:06] understand
[49:07] what it is around us simply because
[49:10] we know that we can't put confidence in
[49:12] anything that our our eyes look at
[49:15] and uh you know for example if a person
[49:17] wants to come to church tonight
[49:19] and uh you know you was to see uh you
[49:21] know
[49:22] some sort of uh uh natural occurrence
[49:25] some disaster some kind of thing
[49:27] we all know those things are temporal
[49:29] they only last for a season and then
[49:30] they
[49:31] go away the bible talked about how that
[49:33] everything we see around us brother joe
[49:35] is a temporal thing we can't trust it we
[49:38] can't put confidence in it
[49:39] we certainly can't believe in it to be
[49:41] an absolute and so we need to look
[49:43] beyond just this
[49:45] natural realm look beyond just where our
[49:47] eyes are always
[49:48] focused on and everything we're always
[49:50] viewing we need to look beyond all of
[49:52] that
[49:53] and so in doing that then there's
[49:55] another realm
[49:56] that is beyond our eyes is faster than
[49:59] our eyes
[50:00] that is brother teresa mentioned the
[50:02] name a moment ago
[50:03] saying that song about will speed up
[50:05] they'll slow down
[50:06] because there's a a dimension around us
[50:10] right now where there is activity
[50:13] taking place in another realm faster
[50:15] than our eyes are you with me so far
[50:17] now i want you to think about something
[50:19] just in a natural uh
[50:21] type approach to it right now this very
[50:23] moment
[50:24] over in another land there are people
[50:27] that are waking up we're getting ready
[50:28] to go to bed in a little while
[50:30] and then people right now are getting
[50:31] ready to wake up there'll be
[50:33] planes operating there'll be trains
[50:35] going down tracks there'll be people
[50:36] getting in their cars and on their
[50:38] motorbikes and
[50:39] they'll be going down to their places of
[50:41] business mothers will be picking up
[50:43] their children and taking them to school
[50:45] they'll be other people starting their
[50:46] day of business opening up the market
[50:49] they'll be doing all sorts of things
[50:51] and yet you and i are sitting right here
[50:53] right now
[50:54] and all we can see is the four walls of
[50:56] evening light tabernacle
[50:58] but yet beyond this building right now
[51:00] there is
[51:01] activity going on around us in this
[51:03] world
[51:04] there is life there is death there is
[51:06] birth
[51:07] there is suffering there is rejoicing
[51:09] there is joy there's all sorts of things
[51:12] that's taking place around us activity
[51:15] that's taking place right now but we
[51:17] can't see it
[51:18] we can't hear it we don't recognize it
[51:20] with our natural life and with our
[51:22] natural eyes
[51:23] so that tells me then that if in the
[51:26] natural i mean this is bringing on home
[51:28] right now in this little city there's
[51:29] people doing all kinds of things
[51:31] uh some town maybe a mile away there's a
[51:34] fellow working on a car
[51:36] trying to get an old car to start up and
[51:38] he's out there priming and juicing and
[51:40] pumping and everything he can do to get
[51:41] it going
[51:42] but yet we don't hear it we don't see it
[51:44] but he's probably over there
[51:47] hollering at the thing and kicking the
[51:48] tires trying to get it to go
[51:50] what i'm trying to say to you is just
[51:52] because you don't see it
[51:54] doesn't mean there's not activity taking
[51:57] place around you
[51:58] amen can somebody say amen now i want
[52:00] you to pay attention
[52:02] to what brother branham said here that
[52:04] angels were the first in the creation
[52:07] of god now if we believe brother branham
[52:08] would be a prophet of god and we believe
[52:10] that he had some sort of insight into
[52:13] supernatural things and we do believe
[52:15] that then we must
[52:16] also believe that this prophet
[52:18] understood what this realm
[52:20] must have looked like because remember
[52:22] outside of the apostle paul i'm talking
[52:25] about the new testament
[52:26] we don't really have a record of a man
[52:28] that was permitted to see
[52:30] into that realm any greater than william
[52:32] branham was as far as
[52:34] a ministry of being able to recognize
[52:37] and see supernatural things
[52:39] uh you know we've had a lot of
[52:41] impersonators come along they've had
[52:43] their angels of the lord and
[52:45] this top bentley down in florida you
[52:46] know he said brother branham's angel
[52:48] come to him and
[52:49] commissioned him to lay hands on the
[52:51] sick and we've had other people talking
[52:53] about angels coming and visiting and
[52:55] all of that is just their opinions and
[52:57] their supernatural
[52:59] imaginations are not supernatural so
[53:01] much but imaginations of supernatural
[53:03] things
[53:04] and and and we you know it seemed like
[53:06] every new doctor that comes along
[53:08] the message somebody's had an angel
[53:09] visit him at some point
[53:11] to give him authority to be able to say
[53:13] the things that they're saying
[53:14] but but we realize that in all of that
[53:17] nonsense out there and all of that
[53:18] counterfeit out there
[53:20] there is an authentic genuine community
[53:23] of angelic beings that god created
[53:26] for the service of the elect of god are
[53:28] you with me amen now brother branham was
[53:30] a window
[53:31] or a door or a look through that we
[53:34] could see
[53:35] into that realm to not only see how that
[53:38] demons behave
[53:39] and to understand how the demons
[53:41] operated but also to
[53:42] see how the angels of the lord operated
[53:45] within themselves
[53:46] now i'm going to give you part two of
[53:48] the little nuggets of my
[53:50] part two of this message now we don't
[53:51] have time to get to part two tonight but
[53:53] i'm going to give you a little peep hole
[53:55] a part two tonight
[53:56] like when you go to the motel you know
[53:58] and you look through that little thing
[53:59] and you get to see a little bit
[54:00] i'm gonna let you look through the
[54:01] little looking glass tonight just a
[54:02] moment
[54:03] and i want you to study this when you
[54:05] get time but go back and watch when
[54:07] brother bannon mentions the angel of the
[54:09] lord that come to him
[54:11] watch how he mentioned to the lord all
[54:13] the way up to 19 and 62
[54:15] until he has a vision of seven angels
[54:17] it's going to medium at sunset
[54:20] then all of a sudden now he goes from
[54:21] talking about the angel
[54:23] singular angel of the lord now he
[54:27] once again over and over and over again
[54:29] after meeting his angels
[54:30] now it is angels of the lord seven
[54:32] angels of the lord seven angels of the
[54:34] lord
[54:34] again and again and again showing that
[54:37] there was a turning of the corner
[54:39] that took place at the opening of the
[54:40] seven seals amen in other words
[54:43] god permitted us to look beyond the
[54:45] curtain of time
[54:47] so that we could look into that realm
[54:48] and see that there was
[54:50] something taking place around you and i
[54:53] i i realize that we may not think of it
[54:56] just in this manner
[54:57] but but remember that when the book of
[54:59] revelation was
[55:00] wrote that john was seeing envisioned
[55:03] things
[55:04] that would take place in a literal
[55:06] manner but john when he was seeing them
[55:08] wasn't taking place right then
[55:10] when he hears the beast say come and see
[55:13] and he hears the thunder and he
[55:14] sees the white horse rider go out it
[55:17] would be it would be
[55:18] you know sometime along his generation
[55:20] that the first horse rider would ride
[55:23] as he writes it in his own epistle when
[55:25] he said little children that spirit
[55:27] of antichrist is already at work among
[55:29] you that's true
[55:31] but when john saw the red horse rider it
[55:33] would be
[55:34] hundreds of years after his passing that
[55:37] the red horse would ever take place
[55:39] the black horse would be a thousand and
[55:41] fifth of that well
[55:42] excuse me 1 500 years later
[55:45] the black horse would step out under
[55:47] that money-making scheme in
[55:50] martin luther's time and start charging
[55:52] people
[55:53] for their prayers and charging them to
[55:56] pay saints
[55:57] out of purgatory and so many hundreds of
[55:59] years after john sees it
[56:01] does it take place and remember there
[56:03] was activity
[56:04] prophesied to take place at the opening
[56:07] of the seven seals
[56:09] there was a cry that went out who is
[56:12] worthy to take this book and loose these
[56:15] seven seals
[56:16] amen that didn't take place when john
[56:18] was looking at it
[56:19] but it was a prophecy of activity
[56:22] hallelujah
[56:22] that would take place in 1963 there
[56:26] would be a cry go out who's worthy to
[56:28] take this book
[56:29] and then the lamb would take this book
[56:31] break the seals and now here we have
[56:33] the opening of the word laying before
[56:35] our eyes
[56:37] activity was taking place let me give
[56:39] you an example of what i mean remember
[56:41] when daniel prayed
[56:43] remember it was 21 days after he had
[56:46] asked the lord to show him
[56:48] what was going to take place in his
[56:50] generation 21 days after john or excuse
[56:53] me daniel
[56:54] had asked god to show him something the
[56:56] moment he prayed when gabriel finally
[56:58] shows up
[56:59] gabriel tells him look i heard you the
[57:01] first time you started talking
[57:04] amen but he said when i come to try to
[57:06] do something for you i couldn't do it
[57:08] on the kind of the prince of persia was
[57:10] there to withstand me
[57:12] but when he started praying there was
[57:14] activity taking place
[57:16] in another dimension don't you know
[57:18] saints it's the same thing with you and
[57:19] i
[57:20] remember when simon peter was in prison
[57:23] remember that
[57:24] you know you go to walmart and you see
[57:26] them doors go
[57:28] peter had the patent on that before them
[57:30] doors was ever invented
[57:32] because when the angel of the lord took
[57:34] him out of prison and prison doors went
[57:37] and peter walked right out the thing and
[57:40] remember he walked up to the very door
[57:41] where the saints were praying
[57:43] for his deliverance and they thought it
[57:44] was a ghost or a spirit of some sort
[57:46] but what was it activity was taking
[57:49] place
[57:50] in another dimension when they were
[57:51] asking god to deliver their brother
[57:54] same thing for you and i brother branham
[57:56] started praying about the age about the
[57:58] generation no other man had that burden
[58:01] you don't see billy graham and oral
[58:02] roberts and them starting to say things
[58:04] to their congregations about
[58:06] there's something about this book of
[58:07] revelation
[58:09] you don't find oral robbers standing up
[58:11] in front of his congregation and saying
[58:13] i'm going to the mountain with a pencil
[58:14] and a and a piece of paper and i'm going
[58:16] to lean up again
[58:17] two plus two is four until these
[58:19] revelations start breaking open
[58:22] nobody else had the burden to understand
[58:24] the hour we were living in like william
[58:26] branham did
[58:28] because the burden was in his heart the
[58:30] same as it was
[58:31] daniel it created activity in another
[58:34] dimension that's why the angels of the
[58:37] lord i kindly have my own personal
[58:38] feeling on that
[58:40] i wonder sometimes brother tom maybe the
[58:42] way that went was
[58:43] the lord had already instructed them
[58:45] seven angels what to watch for
[58:47] and when brother battam was out there
[58:48] walking up that mountain and he had the
[58:50] little brother back behind him it was a
[58:52] little out of shape and he went back to
[58:53] kind of
[58:54] catch up with him a little bit the holy
[58:55] spirit said throw up that rock
[58:57] i've often wondered brother joe the holy
[58:59] spirit hadn't already told him seven
[59:00] angels
[59:01] now let me tell you what your signal is
[59:03] when you move prophet's going to throw
[59:04] up a rock and when you see that you
[59:06] break through that dimension out there
[59:08] hallelujah amen but what was it activity
[59:12] because of the desire of a son of god to
[59:15] know what revelation is
[59:16] well brother if that's the way it was
[59:18] with daniel if that's the way it was
[59:20] with peter
[59:21] if that's the way it was for brother
[59:23] branham what is it with you
[59:24] when you desire to see something of god
[59:27] it creates activity in another dimension
[59:31] amen that's the end of part two i don't
[59:33] even have to preach it now
[59:36] hallelujah i'm the worst evangelist in
[59:38] the world to preach myself out of a job
[59:41] but it creates activity
[59:44] now i want to go back just for a moment
[59:46] to the very beginning
[59:49] if rem said the first thing that christ
[59:51] made was angels
[59:53] then before there was a sun before there
[59:54] was a moon before there were stars
[59:56] before the
[59:57] anything in creation god had this
[59:59] angelic community ready
[1:00:02] to do a job now remember these angels
[1:00:05] were not created with the offending
[1:00:07] bodies
[1:00:08] because in the theophany you know all
[1:00:10] things
[1:00:13] the theophany is the word and the word
[1:00:15] cannot be destroyed remember there'll be
[1:00:17] a portion of these angels to become
[1:00:19] demons
[1:00:20] that be cast into the lake of fire and
[1:00:23] they'll be destroyed so these angels
[1:00:24] were not created
[1:00:26] with a theophany body that knew all
[1:00:28] things even jesus
[1:00:29] said that the son of man doesn't even
[1:00:31] know nor
[1:00:32] the angels in heaven the time that jesus
[1:00:35] will return the coming of the
[1:00:37] so the angels of god do not have
[1:00:39] infinite wisdom
[1:00:41] they don't know everything about
[1:00:42] everything
[1:00:44] and the reason of that is is because god
[1:00:46] created them to be
[1:00:47] servants to serve you and i
[1:00:51] in the body of christ i'm going to tell
[1:00:54] you all something i want you listen to
[1:00:55] me carefully
[1:00:57] in your lifetime you may be saying to
[1:00:59] yourself i'm all alone
[1:01:01] before this evening is over i'm gonna
[1:01:03] prove to you you are never alone and
[1:01:05] never have been alone
[1:01:07] god in his word has surrounded you
[1:01:10] with a heavenly host
[1:01:14] you say how many are there i don't know
[1:01:16] because the bible said like this
[1:01:18] those demons those that were once angels
[1:01:21] in heaven john said you could number
[1:01:22] them
[1:01:23] two hundred thousand thousand but when
[1:01:25] paul spoke about these heavenly angels
[1:01:27] around us
[1:01:29] he said it's innumerable in other words
[1:01:32] you can't number how many christ has got
[1:01:35] hallelujah and hallelujah
[1:01:38] now if this was the first thing that god
[1:01:41] made it was also the first battle that
[1:01:44] was ever
[1:01:45] engaged remember it was lucifer who was
[1:01:48] also an angel the highest angel created
[1:01:52] in all of this angelic community
[1:01:54] remember there's degrees of these angels
[1:01:55] they don't all have the same power
[1:01:57] they don't all have the same authorities
[1:01:59] they all don't have the same abilities
[1:02:02] that's why religious devil is a whole
[1:02:03] lot harder to deal with than a devil of
[1:02:06] smoking or drinking or something of that
[1:02:08] nature
[1:02:09] and if you all that ever used to smoke
[1:02:10] and the lord delivered you of it you
[1:02:12] know how hard it is to quit smoking
[1:02:15] my daddy said one time many years ago he
[1:02:17] had he had to die
[1:02:19] in order to get away from them and it
[1:02:21] just about did with heart failure back
[1:02:23] in the 80s
[1:02:26] and even that kind of a struggle ain't
[1:02:28] nothing compared to a religious spirit
[1:02:30] why they're made different some have
[1:02:34] different abilities
[1:02:35] some are stronger than the other the
[1:02:37] prince of persia was stronger than
[1:02:39] gabriel
[1:02:40] and until him and michael ganged up and
[1:02:41] tagged him against the prince of persia
[1:02:43] he was fighting to lose in battle
[1:02:46] don't ever think that these demons that
[1:02:48] you wrestle with don't understand what
[1:02:50] it means to be supernatural
[1:02:53] religious speak in tongues and shout
[1:02:56] brother brahman said i've seen demons do
[1:02:58] it remember you're talking about beings
[1:03:01] that were once angels of god
[1:03:04] in heaven that's why the powers that are
[1:03:08] against us
[1:03:09] this is why we need the holy ghost
[1:03:11] because listen to me
[1:03:13] the devil who is a fallen angel never
[1:03:16] sleeps
[1:03:17] never eats never gets hungry never gets
[1:03:20] fatigued
[1:03:21] never gets tired never gets wore out
[1:03:25] he's got all every minute of the day to
[1:03:28] plan against you
[1:03:30] to work out schemes against your life
[1:03:33] and you think your puny little flesh is
[1:03:35] going to be any match for a demon that
[1:03:37] ain't slept for 6 000 years forever how
[1:03:39] long
[1:03:39] his creative time has been this is why
[1:03:43] we need the holy ghost
[1:03:45] and a double portion of it in order to
[1:03:47] be able to overcome
[1:03:48] every spirit that comes against the
[1:03:50] bride in this last day
[1:03:54] right we'll never be able to overcome it
[1:03:55] ourself so the first battle that took
[1:03:58] place was amongst these angels
[1:04:00] the first sin that took place was among
[1:04:02] them two
[1:04:03] remember lucifer sin coming against god
[1:04:08] so the first fall that ever took place
[1:04:11] was when these angels left their real
[1:04:13] estate god had given real estate in
[1:04:15] heaven
[1:04:16] and they left it walked off and left
[1:04:19] what god
[1:04:19] had placed in their hands oh but here's
[1:04:22] the hallelujah tonight
[1:04:24] when these angels fell from heaven you
[1:04:27] never find god said one deer
[1:04:30] you never hear him come back saying oh
[1:04:33] come
[1:04:33] you come i'll forgive you when they
[1:04:36] messed up god said get out
[1:04:40] but sometime later there's a scene
[1:04:42] unfolding on the earth
[1:04:44] and one of god's boys gets in trouble
[1:04:50] almighty god comes down from heaven
[1:04:52] himself
[1:04:54] crying and weeping adam
[1:04:57] adam where are you you see
[1:05:01] when angels fall it didn't even really
[1:05:04] move the heart of god
[1:05:06] because how much more is a son than a
[1:05:09] servant
[1:05:11] but when you fail when you come to the
[1:05:14] world speaking lies
[1:05:16] it's so moved the heart of god do you
[1:05:18] realize in the days of the annelid
[1:05:20] whenever the bible said in the days of
[1:05:22] noah repented god that he even made man
[1:05:24] you know what that word repented means
[1:05:26] it means that it grieved god until he
[1:05:28] cried
[1:05:30] when he saw his creation in the
[1:05:32] situation they were in
[1:05:34] i want you to find me one scripture
[1:05:35] where god ever got that upset
[1:05:37] over an angel find me one place where he
[1:05:40] ever got that tore up and that
[1:05:42] disheveled over an
[1:05:43] angel falling out of their position but
[1:05:46] when you get in trouble
[1:05:48] come on when you get in a spot where you
[1:05:51] don't know what to do
[1:05:52] it moves the heart of god in a way you
[1:05:54] could never even explain it
[1:05:58] praise god oh thank you jesus
[1:06:02] now notice angels can take on human form
[1:06:05] human characteristics if you'd like to
[1:06:07] see that it's genesis chapter 19 verse
[1:06:10] 1.
[1:06:10] two angels go down to sodom and lot
[1:06:13] meets these two angels
[1:06:14] falls himself to the ground and says my
[1:06:17] lords
[1:06:20] it was a lot different than that with
[1:06:22] abraham
[1:06:24] abraham saw three and brother john when
[1:06:27] he sees the three he says my lord
[1:06:30] because abraham had a revelation there's
[1:06:31] only one god
[1:06:33] uh come on when lord sees him lots of
[1:06:37] heathen
[1:06:39] at least he's been influenced by
[1:06:40] heathenism and he sees more than one and
[1:06:43] he says my lords
[1:06:45] worships sure that's the way the church
[1:06:47] world is
[1:06:48] fall down for anything any old thing
[1:06:50] fall for anything that moves
[1:06:53] but a true seed of god knows there's
[1:06:54] only one god
[1:06:57] and we do not worship angels
[1:07:00] but let's give credit where credit is
[1:07:02] due
[1:07:05] sometimes the things and the events that
[1:07:07] take place in your life in my life
[1:07:09] the help that god sends to us sometimes
[1:07:12] it ain't always directly the holy spirit
[1:07:14] moving on your behalf
[1:07:18] oh that got you thinking sometimes it's
[1:07:22] the angels of the lord commissioned
[1:07:24] to do work for you and i
[1:07:28] we say god move sure he'll move
[1:07:32] he'll do things but sometimes it ain't
[1:07:35] always the pillar of fire coming into
[1:07:36] the room
[1:07:38] to do certain things no he's got
[1:07:40] servants
[1:07:42] like the roman centurion said i tell
[1:07:44] them to go and they go i tell them to do
[1:07:45] and they do i tell them to act and they
[1:07:46] act
[1:07:48] well you ask god for anything sometimes
[1:07:51] if you ever recognize
[1:07:52] you don't feel the holy spirit but you
[1:07:54] know supernatural things are happening
[1:07:57] why it isn't the pillar of fire standing
[1:07:59] right by you directly
[1:08:00] he's got angels of god standing there
[1:08:02] doing a work for you
[1:08:04] now be careful before you get too
[1:08:05] critical of me i'm quoting your quote
[1:08:07] i'm just not telling you i'm doing it
[1:08:10] because they ask brother random about
[1:08:11] that why don't you give credit to the
[1:08:13] spirit of the lord he said i've got to
[1:08:14] be truthful
[1:08:16] he said it isn't always the holy spirit
[1:08:18] he said sometimes it's the angel of the
[1:08:20] lord doing now
[1:08:21] mind you it's god to it's a top and
[1:08:23] it'll be god at the bottom
[1:08:26] but how does god move sometimes how does
[1:08:28] he act
[1:08:30] is it always him running from one part
[1:08:31] of the throne to another
[1:08:33] down to kentucky down over here to
[1:08:34] tennessee running over and doing that
[1:08:36] he's got an innumerable host of servants
[1:08:39] that are commissioned to do the works
[1:08:41] that he commands them to do
[1:08:45] praise god again please let me remind
[1:08:48] you
[1:08:49] you're never alone
[1:08:53] notice now let's look at a new testament
[1:08:55] version hebrews chapter 13 verse 2.
[1:08:58] if angels can take on human form in the
[1:09:00] old testament what about the new
[1:09:01] testament
[1:09:01] paul said be not forgetful to entertain
[1:09:04] strangers
[1:09:05] for thereby some have entertained angels
[1:09:09] unawares
[1:09:12] now you know for most of us we would
[1:09:13] look for you know ufos if we walked out
[1:09:16] here in the parking lot flight in a big
[1:09:17] old
[1:09:17] round light zhu my goodness
[1:09:21] facebook would turn upside down we would
[1:09:24] tweet
[1:09:24] and it would be on instagram and
[1:09:26] everything else in the world oh you
[1:09:28] wouldn't believe what we just saw
[1:09:31] brother madam said that those
[1:09:32] investigating angels they come down to
[1:09:34] see the condition of humanity
[1:09:36] but what if sometimes them ufos show up
[1:09:39] in the form
[1:09:40] of unidentified flying visitors
[1:09:45] somebody that comes into the church just
[1:09:47] randomly
[1:09:49] just coming in i wonder if god sends
[1:09:51] them among us just to see what our
[1:09:53] attitude's going to be sometimes
[1:09:56] how we're going to treat people how
[1:09:58] we're going to
[1:09:59] welcome them or what we're going to say
[1:10:01] to them
[1:10:02] oh god some of y'all are guilty already
[1:10:04] ain't all or nothing
[1:10:06] well this is where you need to say
[1:10:07] forgive me lord and move on and fix it
[1:10:10] right but it'd be easy for us if we was
[1:10:12] to sit in a condition to say
[1:10:14] that the holy spirit was absolutely
[1:10:16] trying to help us
[1:10:18] and we'd say god i want you to help me
[1:10:21] you don't feel the lord
[1:10:23] you don't feel the holy ghost all of a
[1:10:26] sudden somebody shows up on the side of
[1:10:27] the road to help you fix your tire
[1:10:30] now you know what the agnostics and what
[1:10:32] the atheist the carnal and the
[1:10:34] intellectuals say
[1:10:35] well that's just life that's just the
[1:10:37] way life
[1:10:38] oh it isn't that simple
[1:10:42] those things are sent down many times
[1:10:45] as angels unawares if god can move on a
[1:10:49] donkey
[1:10:50] to spare a prophet can't god move on a
[1:10:53] motorist to help you with your tire
[1:10:56] come on somebody if we believe that god
[1:10:59] is in control of
[1:11:00] everything my brother's sister there is
[1:11:03] nothing
[1:11:04] he don't have his hand upon
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:07] we just have to trust him that he knows
[1:11:09] what's going on
[1:11:11] if he's god if he's god he knows the end
[1:11:14] from the beginning so we should trust
[1:11:15] him or shut up and get out of the game
[1:11:18] come on we get all of our belly aching
[1:11:22] and grumbling oh god
[1:11:24] yeah i wonder to a being who knows
[1:11:26] everything how silly we sound some
[1:11:31] i mean i was carrying on the other day
[1:11:33] anybody ever carry on
[1:11:35] i'm in the south you're saying carrying
[1:11:37] on don't you i say that up north and
[1:11:38] then yankees go huh
[1:11:40] carrying what was he carrying
[1:11:45] and i was telling the lord oh lord this
[1:11:47] and all of
[1:11:48] that and all of a sudden i just i
[1:11:50] literally pinched my lips shut and i
[1:11:52] said shut up
[1:11:54] i said ben you're the dumbest person in
[1:11:56] the world you are telling god who knows
[1:11:59] everything what's going on
[1:12:02] i thought well how silly so i just
[1:12:04] repented i said lord
[1:12:06] i'm sorry for trying to remind you of
[1:12:07] what you saw before the world was ever
[1:12:09] created
[1:12:10] i just need your help i'm sorry for my
[1:12:14] humanity
[1:12:15] but what i'm trying to tell you lord is
[1:12:16] i need your help
[1:12:20] praise god kind of like him fellas when
[1:12:22] they go on the prayer closet you know
[1:12:23] they start quoting every book of obadiah
[1:12:25] and
[1:12:26] habakkuk oh lord how are god on page so
[1:12:31] and so the prophet said you think you
[1:12:32] don't know his word already
[1:12:35] you reckon we have to quote word to him
[1:12:36] all the time lord as the prophet of god
[1:12:39] said
[1:12:40] and the bible said and john said
[1:12:43] i wonder if sometimes jesus don't look
[1:12:45] down at us and go these poor dumb kids
[1:12:47] of mine i wish i'd get it through their
[1:12:51] head
[1:12:52] for he is god don't you look at me that
[1:12:55] way if you're a father you're a mother
[1:12:57] you know how you feel about your youngin
[1:12:58] sometimes
[1:12:59] you've got their world you've got their
[1:13:01] world in your hands and the way they
[1:13:03] carry on you say you silly things
[1:13:06] you got to know that jesus probably
[1:13:07] looks at us sometimes and goes don't you
[1:13:10] know
[1:13:10] don't worry about the light bit don't
[1:13:12] worry about the gas don't worry about i
[1:13:14] got it taken care of
[1:13:22] notice even about jesus in psalms 8 5
[1:13:26] said they made him god made him a little
[1:13:28] lower than the angels
[1:13:31] now why is that you think about
[1:13:32] something for a moment
[1:13:34] and i would like to couple this
[1:13:36] scripture now with matthew 22
[1:13:38] 30. if you'd like to write this down or
[1:13:40] if you've got your book there you'd like
[1:13:41] to look at it
[1:13:42] jesus said that in the resurrection we
[1:13:44] were neither married or given
[1:13:46] married but be given marriage but be as
[1:13:48] the angels of god in heaven okay
[1:13:51] so if jesus then was made lower than the
[1:13:53] angels
[1:13:55] and then when we are changed in the
[1:13:56] resurrection we'll be more like the
[1:13:58] angels now what does that mean exactly
[1:14:01] and mind you when i say what i'm getting
[1:14:02] ready to say i am quoting you a quote
[1:14:04] i'm just not going to tell you where
[1:14:05] it's at because i'm going to do all your
[1:14:06] homework for you
[1:14:09] but remember that that jesus came to the
[1:14:12] world with sexual
[1:14:13] instrumentality he could be tempted by
[1:14:17] sexual things all right now listen close
[1:14:19] don't get a filthy mind
[1:14:20] and keep your mind on what i'm trying to
[1:14:22] tell you
[1:14:24] remember the very thing that put you and
[1:14:26] i in the condition we are in
[1:14:28] today all of your impatience all of your
[1:14:30] temper
[1:14:31] all of your strains all your sicknesses
[1:14:33] everything you put up with
[1:14:34] it came here because of sex desire
[1:14:38] yes or no come on talk
[1:14:42] to me that's the whole reason we showed
[1:14:44] up like we showed up
[1:14:46] so notice then that the lord jesus then
[1:14:49] was made lower than the angels why
[1:14:52] because
[1:14:52] angels were not made with reproductive
[1:14:56] instruments they have no sex clans
[1:14:59] they have no organs to reproduce by so
[1:15:02] they cannot propagate
[1:15:03] another species as it was given to the
[1:15:06] man
[1:15:06] he never said to the angels multiply
[1:15:10] and replenish the earth
[1:15:15] so angels have never smoked they've
[1:15:16] never drank they'd never curse they've
[1:15:18] never lied
[1:15:19] they've never committed adultery they've
[1:15:20] never felt lust they don't even know
[1:15:22] what it means
[1:15:25] but then jesus comes made lower than the
[1:15:29] angels
[1:15:30] meaning he came with all the
[1:15:32] instrumentality yes the prophet of god
[1:15:34] said jesus could have reproduced and had
[1:15:35] a family if he wanted to
[1:15:38] any of y'all ever hear about this
[1:15:39] ridiculous thing the da vinci code you
[1:15:41] know some of the
[1:15:42] uh the story line behind the da vinci
[1:15:44] code of course all the
[1:15:45] you know the charismatics they were all
[1:15:46] just you know flipping upside down
[1:15:48] oh my about jesus having a literal
[1:15:51] daughter he could have done it
[1:15:55] part of the storyline is is that jesus
[1:15:58] actually reproduced he could have done
[1:16:00] it he had the ability to do it
[1:16:03] listen but when we are changed
[1:16:06] notice this again in luke chapter 20
[1:16:08] verse 36 he said neither can we die
[1:16:11] for we are equal to the angels and
[1:16:13] resurrection now
[1:16:14] and are the children of god being the
[1:16:16] children of the resurrection
[1:16:20] oh now watch so then jesus come to this
[1:16:24] earth
[1:16:25] you realize that with even the sex
[1:16:27] glands in our lips i read a study here
[1:16:29] not long ago
[1:16:30] that they said when a man and woman kiss
[1:16:33] that they exchange
[1:16:35] dna a portion of dna and they said that
[1:16:39] even
[1:16:39] as much as 40 years later
[1:16:43] they can pick up the dna from the person
[1:16:46] that they kissed 40 years before that
[1:16:50] it's something that once those glands
[1:16:52] exchange it lays in their body
[1:16:54] and some of these people that run around
[1:16:55] the mess are saying it's all right to
[1:16:56] kiss and carry on
[1:16:57] before they get married you better check
[1:16:59] that out really carefully
[1:17:01] as brother madam says potentially commit
[1:17:03] adultery you see why
[1:17:05] it's the crossing up of those glands and
[1:17:07] your first kiss should be at the altar
[1:17:11] right or you say but what if i'm guilty
[1:17:14] well then you never do it again you say
[1:17:16] god help me
[1:17:16] and you stay straight until you get a
[1:17:18] chance to get married
[1:17:20] be sure to confess it to your husband
[1:17:21] and future wife whoever it might be
[1:17:23] and let them know where you stand come
[1:17:24] on now
[1:17:26] right don't hide nothing like that say
[1:17:28] what's right because it's existing
[1:17:30] in your body
[1:17:35] so in the resurrection then we'll be
[1:17:38] more like the angels why
[1:17:42] now remember they've never smoked
[1:17:45] they've never cursed they've never drank
[1:17:47] they've never committed adultery and
[1:17:49] when we are changed we will be made
[1:17:52] just like them in other words ourselves
[1:17:55] will be
[1:17:55] rearranged and recreated so that we
[1:17:59] will be like those that have never
[1:18:02] smoked
[1:18:03] never cursed never drank never lied
[1:18:05] never committed adultery
[1:18:08] the very thing that put us in this
[1:18:10] condition before will be completely
[1:18:12] rearranged
[1:18:13] because that's the tree of knowledge of
[1:18:15] good and evil
[1:18:17] search scriptures that's the whole
[1:18:19] reason you're in the in the mess you are
[1:18:21] today
[1:18:22] because your great great great great
[1:18:24] great great great great great
[1:18:26] great great granddaddy had an awful
[1:18:28] temper and had a temper to fight a
[1:18:29] buzzsaw and about 12 or 14 generations
[1:18:32] later
[1:18:32] here you are and not only do you get
[1:18:35] that great great great great temper but
[1:18:36] you get a great great great great one
[1:18:38] than the great great great hat
[1:18:40] ain't that great
[1:18:45] come on now church but when we are
[1:18:48] changed
[1:18:49] our bodies will be rearranged hallelujah
[1:18:52] to reflect a complete
[1:18:55] conversion as though we were never
[1:18:59] born by sex desire in the beginning
[1:19:03] all that temper all that impatience all
[1:19:05] those desires all those things that lay
[1:19:07] in your body
[1:19:08] all those fights and struggles and late
[1:19:10] night this that the other early morning
[1:19:11] that whatever
[1:19:12] amen oh that'll be taken out of you
[1:19:16] and you'll be like the angels
[1:19:20] oh praise the lord
[1:19:23] now notice this again
[1:19:26] oh my i love this scripture right here
[1:19:29] first peter chapter 1 verse 12
[1:19:32] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[1:19:34] themselves but
[1:19:35] unto us they did minister things
[1:19:38] which are now reported unto you by them
[1:19:40] that have preached the gospel unto you
[1:19:42] with the holy ghost sent down from
[1:19:44] heaven now peter is saying
[1:19:45] that the report of the gospel has come
[1:19:48] to us
[1:19:48] by those that have preached the the
[1:19:51] gospel with the holy ghost from heaven
[1:19:54] you see this is the reason you want a
[1:19:55] real man of god preaching to you
[1:19:59] because here in greatest battle ever
[1:20:00] fought brother bradham said that when a
[1:20:02] minister comes to the platform
[1:20:05] an angel of the lord comes down
[1:20:09] to anoint the gift to serve the people
[1:20:14] so if there's no gift there there's no
[1:20:17] angel there
[1:20:18] you know what you got you got a good
[1:20:20] talker a charismatic speaker
[1:20:22] somebody good with power points and big
[1:20:24] words
[1:20:25] but you don't have an anointed man
[1:20:30] friends why do you think that many times
[1:20:31] we get these guys in the platform that
[1:20:33] they talk well but nothing ever happens
[1:20:36] if you leave a church service and you
[1:20:37] ain't been scorched or burned or
[1:20:39] convicted
[1:20:40] or made to feel some sort of emotion or
[1:20:42] helped or blessed or some other thing
[1:20:44] then that man of god i don't care how
[1:20:46] much you call him a preacher
[1:20:47] he's no preacher in god's book
[1:20:51] because part of my job is to come here
[1:20:52] and make you mad
[1:20:55] whoa come on because if you're living
[1:20:57] wrong and you ain't doing right
[1:20:59] read romans chapter 13 and see what i'm
[1:21:01] supposed to do with this sword word
[1:21:03] right here
[1:21:04] i'm supposed to eat you alive
[1:21:10] and and how am i going to do that if i'm
[1:21:12] not anointed with a gift
[1:21:14] because you understand human temper
[1:21:16] would not produce conviction
[1:21:20] human aggravation cannot produce
[1:21:22] repentance
[1:21:24] but if a man is gifted and an angel of
[1:21:25] the lord comes from heaven to anoint
[1:21:27] that gift and he enters into that
[1:21:28] channel to rebuke sin
[1:21:30] it'll produce a conviction it'll produce
[1:21:33] a repentance in the heart
[1:21:35] huh come on but if you don't have that
[1:21:38] then all he's going to do is yell at you
[1:21:40] and when you walk out of church you
[1:21:41] certainly don't feel rebuked you feel
[1:21:45] not spiritually rebuked anyways
[1:21:48] you feel like you've just you've just
[1:21:49] been yelled at all night
[1:21:52] that's why a real man of god if he
[1:21:53] enters into that channel he eats you up
[1:21:56] it is strange christians are the only
[1:21:58] people that can come and get yelled at
[1:22:00] and told how sorry they are
[1:22:01] and walk out crying saying thank you
[1:22:03] lord
[1:22:04] what do you reckon does that the gift of
[1:22:06] the holy spirit the heavenly holy spirit
[1:22:08] comes down to speak to your heart to
[1:22:11] show you how to correct and live better
[1:22:16] men cannot produce that
[1:22:23] i love this next statement peter says
[1:22:25] which things the
[1:22:26] angels decide to look
[1:22:29] into now this word look means to stoop
[1:22:32] down
[1:22:34] to bend the head and the body over to
[1:22:36] look to inspect
[1:22:38] the thing now you realize these angels
[1:22:41] of the lord were with you at your birth
[1:22:44] remember the prophet of god talked about
[1:22:45] when your mother was getting ready to
[1:22:46] give birth you there was a real sweet
[1:22:48] spirit
[1:22:50] oh sure i realized that was your soul
[1:22:51] that was you know just whatever you want
[1:22:53] to say it was but it was also the
[1:22:55] presence of the angel of the lord that
[1:22:56] behold your father's face for you
[1:23:00] because all of us have them as a matter
[1:23:02] of fact everybody has them
[1:23:06] you say everybody sure until the age of
[1:23:09] accountability that is
[1:23:12] everybody has a protective angel because
[1:23:15] god is just
[1:23:17] god gives everybody an opportunity to
[1:23:19] get right
[1:23:21] but what happens if an individual
[1:23:24] rejects the lord jesus
[1:23:26] very simple you reject god you reject
[1:23:29] everything that comes with him
[1:23:31] so take these people that have lived
[1:23:32] like the world and here they are on the
[1:23:34] other side they don't want
[1:23:35] nothing to do with religion but yet
[1:23:36] they'll talk about supernatural
[1:23:38] experiences when they almost drowned and
[1:23:40] all of a sudden something happened what
[1:23:42] was that
[1:23:42] the angel of the lord was protecting and
[1:23:45] watching over them
[1:23:47] to give them an opportunity to get saved
[1:23:52] but whenever they cross that line the
[1:23:54] angel just walks away just like god and
[1:23:57] every other heavenly thing
[1:24:02] but what about you that accept he
[1:24:04] doesn't leave
[1:24:06] he stays there he's watched over you at
[1:24:10] your birth
[1:24:11] and he'll watch over you at your death
[1:24:15] he was with you when you was on the
[1:24:16] barstool he was with you when he was
[1:24:19] running around doing this out in the
[1:24:20] other
[1:24:20] come on out
[1:24:23] and the day you got saved by the tom
[1:24:26] this angel
[1:24:28] stooped
[1:24:31] i i've watched him smoke i've watched
[1:24:33] him drink i've watched her curse i've
[1:24:35] watched her lie
[1:24:37] but i've never seen this before
[1:24:40] the joy that fills your face the tears
[1:24:42] coming down your eyes the chains
[1:24:45] that come over you the angel it's so
[1:24:49] is so peculiar to them that they
[1:24:52] actually stoop down
[1:24:55] what is going on
[1:24:59] because they don't understand redemption
[1:25:02] when an angel messes up
[1:25:04] that's it god don't even give him a
[1:25:07] second chance
[1:25:09] but when you and i mess up he gives us
[1:25:11] chance after chance after chance
[1:25:14] after chance after chance
[1:25:18] he preserves us whereas he doesn't
[1:25:21] preserve these angels that fall
[1:25:25] they have no idea they don't understand
[1:25:27] what's going on because they can't
[1:25:29] relate to what salvation looks
[1:25:33] and feels like
[1:25:39] watch this in matthew chapter 4.
[1:25:43] notice that let's look and see what
[1:25:45] these angels of god are
[1:25:48] jesus here fighting with the devil the
[1:25:50] devil leaveth him that's a pretty good
[1:25:51] thing
[1:25:53] you just get in such a condition that
[1:25:54] the devil will go away we're in pretty
[1:25:55] good shape then anyway
[1:25:58] notice the bible said behold angels came
[1:26:00] and ministered unto him
[1:26:02] do you know what this word minister
[1:26:04] means it means
[1:26:06] to glory wait at a table
[1:26:10] and offer food and drink to guests
[1:26:15] you and i know what we call those in
[1:26:17] modern day terms
[1:26:18] a waiter
[1:26:23] so in other words these angels
[1:26:26] are your special waiter in life
[1:26:29] i want to ask you a question if you're
[1:26:31] sitting down at a table
[1:26:32] and you've run out of drink and you
[1:26:34] ain't got no silverware and they've been
[1:26:36] waiting 30 minutes on ketchup do you sit
[1:26:38] around
[1:26:39] well you know that that's just the way
[1:26:42] it is
[1:26:42] oh i know i i make some of you i know
[1:26:44] how you are
[1:26:45] [Music]
[1:26:46] where in the world is that woman at i've
[1:26:48] been waiting 30 minutes
[1:26:50] on that sketchup where she gotta have
[1:26:52] this ketchup
[1:26:55] i'm leaving her a five dollar tip i'll
[1:26:57] leave her five cents in a piece of my
[1:26:58] mind
[1:27:00] careful how many pieces of your mind
[1:27:01] that you leave
[1:27:03] you can't get them back when you leave
[1:27:04] them
[1:27:08] but this is what god called the angels
[1:27:11] of the lord the very word
[1:27:13] that he uses for angel is a
[1:27:16] servant
[1:27:20] so that means if the devil was an angel
[1:27:22] in the beginning
[1:27:24] he was actually created to be
[1:27:28] my servant no wonder he hates us
[1:27:32] because in his very creation with all
[1:27:34] his brightness all of his glory
[1:27:36] all of his pomp and beauty
[1:27:41] he was still subjugated to the bride
[1:27:44] from the very beginning no wonder he
[1:27:46] hates you
[1:27:50] but now these angels of the lord are
[1:27:52] servants to the bride
[1:27:54] so if you're sitting there and you need
[1:27:55] more drink what do you do
[1:27:57] you call for them uh excuse me
[1:28:01] get more pepsi some more waters we need
[1:28:04] salts or napkins
[1:28:06] never understood why in the world these
[1:28:08] waiters and waitresses come to a table
[1:28:10] full of youngins and bring about one or
[1:28:11] two little napkins usually the ones
[1:28:14] ain't got no kids they bring about one
[1:28:16] napkin or two
[1:28:18] we would sit in a little place the other
[1:28:19] day and this lady brought us a break old
[1:28:21] great big old stack like that and i said
[1:28:23] you got kids she said yes i do
[1:28:27] but they were created to be your servant
[1:28:29] so you need more drink
[1:28:30] what do you do call for it oh
[1:28:34] i want to tell you something tonight
[1:28:36] amen as a sign as a dollar of god
[1:28:38] if you need more holy ghost if you need
[1:28:41] more joy
[1:28:42] if you need that refilling of the holy
[1:28:44] spirit all you've got to do is call for
[1:28:48] it
[1:28:52] they are created for your service
[1:28:58] do you remember the two women that came
[1:29:00] in the prayer line
[1:29:02] brother branham said one come up with
[1:29:03] stomach trouble another one had a cancer
[1:29:05] on her
[1:29:07] and he said after they went out of the
[1:29:08] prayer line and said they live right
[1:29:10] next door to each other nearly
[1:29:12] he said the one got up that morning and
[1:29:14] said she got hungry
[1:29:16] glory scrambled up some eggs and fried
[1:29:19] some bacon and
[1:29:20] drink some coffee and said that tastes
[1:29:22] pretty good jordan she made sausage a
[1:29:23] few
[1:29:24] other things for long she said i'm
[1:29:26] healed i'm healed i'm healed
[1:29:30] she went down to the house to tell her
[1:29:31] friend about it
[1:29:33] and she's out there shaking the bed
[1:29:35] sheet looking for that cancer that had
[1:29:36] fallen off her body
[1:29:38] you know what brother adam said he said
[1:29:40] the angel of the lord
[1:29:43] was passing through that neighborhood
[1:29:46] amen and when he brought one healing to
[1:29:48] one he brought the healing to the other
[1:29:50] that's what i'm trying to tell you
[1:29:52] tonight your prayers
[1:29:54] your desires your burdens has created
[1:29:58] activity and another round be on our
[1:30:01] eyes
[1:30:04] if we could only open up to see it
[1:30:08] we would recognize that the angels of
[1:30:10] the lord are here tonight
[1:30:13] to serve your needs
[1:30:17] they don't go back up to heaven and then
[1:30:18] pop back down
[1:30:20] they encamp about those
[1:30:24] that fear the lord
[1:30:29] oh bless his holy name
[1:30:32] can you say praise the lord
[1:30:35] now remember we're not supposed to
[1:30:37] worship these angels as paul said in
[1:30:38] colossians 2 18
[1:30:40] the worshiping of angels but we should
[1:30:42] give credit where credit is due
[1:30:46] it isn't always the holy spirit directly
[1:30:48] specifically in
[1:30:49] contact doing an action have you ever
[1:30:52] felt
[1:30:54] when you've asked god for something you
[1:30:56] feel like when you're praying sometimes
[1:30:59] you feel the holy spirit so close in the
[1:31:02] room
[1:31:02] like you can just reach out and describe
[1:31:04] a big piece of him and pull him in
[1:31:07] and then there are times you pray and
[1:31:09] you feel something it's supernatural but
[1:31:11] it isn't exactly god
[1:31:14] you know what it is because jesus said
[1:31:18] that the angels of the lord are
[1:31:19] witnesses
[1:31:21] y'all don't know how bad i wish i had
[1:31:22] two more hours here tonight because i
[1:31:24] would absolutely
[1:31:25] turn you inside out some of these things
[1:31:27] i got laying up here
[1:31:28] how do i know i'd turn you inside out
[1:31:30] because it turned me inside out when i
[1:31:31] read them
[1:31:34] do you understand that there are note
[1:31:35] takers you think you take good notes in
[1:31:37] church not nearly like these angels of
[1:31:39] the lord
[1:31:41] they pay attention to everything that's
[1:31:43] going on matter of fact brother man said
[1:31:45] there's recording angels in every church
[1:31:47] service
[1:31:49] how do these men of god lace and preach
[1:31:52] the same messages
[1:31:55] because god has got notes going back up
[1:31:58] to heaven
[1:32:00] how does he know on the other side of
[1:32:01] the bride is getting ready
[1:32:03] because these investigating angels are
[1:32:05] taking these messages back to daddy
[1:32:08] oh he knows it he knows the end from the
[1:32:10] beginning but you're not listening to me
[1:32:12] he uses these servants as part of his
[1:32:15] economy
[1:32:18] it's just like he could send har
[1:32:20] laborers into the harvest he could just
[1:32:22] snap his fingers and send preachers
[1:32:24] everywhere but jesus didn't say
[1:32:26] he did it that way he said you pray
[1:32:31] so it goes to prove you have not because
[1:32:34] you ask not
[1:32:35] now if you're sitting at the table of
[1:32:37] god or you're sitting at the restaurant
[1:32:40] and it's like this mexican place up here
[1:32:41] they painted it white didn't they
[1:32:43] it's new i saw that thing looks good
[1:32:47] and you're sitting up there you know and
[1:32:49] maybe an hour goes by
[1:32:50] and you are so thirsty you could suck on
[1:32:53] a hickory nut
[1:32:55] you are just absolutely pour out with
[1:32:57] thirst
[1:32:58] and that lady of that man has passed you
[1:33:00] by about 15 times
[1:33:02] don't you go walking out of there and
[1:33:03] saying this is the sorriest
[1:33:04] establishment i've ever been in
[1:33:06] you know where the real fault lays
[1:33:09] because you wouldn't stop them to say
[1:33:10] hey
[1:33:12] i need more
[1:33:16] words amen in case you forgot it
[1:33:19] right this is what jesus said and when
[1:33:21] you ask ask in faith
[1:33:22] believing that you're going to receive
[1:33:24] what you asked for
[1:33:26] if you need more peace in your life all
[1:33:28] you've got to do is ask god of it
[1:33:32] listen there's no supernatural formula
[1:33:34] here this is not some supernatural
[1:33:36] workup
[1:33:37] oh you know if i could hold my hands in
[1:33:39] a certain way or if i can get so sincere
[1:33:42] that's why you see people around this
[1:33:43] message
[1:33:43] that have yet to break themselves free
[1:33:46] of all this old traditionalism that
[1:33:47] they've carried over from pentecost
[1:33:49] apostolic house
[1:33:50] and you'll see them when they're praying
[1:33:52] they're trying to force god to hear them
[1:33:53] oh god
[1:33:54] oh god you don't have to do all of that
[1:33:57] just say the words
[1:33:59] lord i have a
[1:34:02] need it doesn't matter if you're crying
[1:34:05] when you say it doesn't matter if your
[1:34:06] straight face don't matter if you're
[1:34:07] stoic it's an old robot
[1:34:10] all you gotta do is ask for it
[1:34:12] [Applause]
[1:34:14] and the servants are listening oh more
[1:34:18] holy ghost
[1:34:18] coming right up more victory coming
[1:34:23] right up
[1:34:25] you just have to take time to ask for it
[1:34:28] friends you're going to find most of the
[1:34:30] nonsense we carry on ain't nothing but
[1:34:32] just traditional carryover
[1:34:34] it is but you know we come to the altar
[1:34:37] and you'll see people that
[1:34:38] they're banging and screaming and
[1:34:40] hollering you know
[1:34:41] 90 of the time and i've been a minister
[1:34:44] going on next year
[1:34:45] 30 years i've been around the world a
[1:34:47] couple different times now
[1:34:49] the majority of that stuff you see like
[1:34:51] that ain't nothing but a bunch of
[1:34:52] emotional work up
[1:34:54] and people trying to convince themselves
[1:34:56] to be spiritual
[1:34:58] i don't doubt there's some sincerity i
[1:35:01] don't doubt there's some people that
[1:35:02] mean business with god when they come up
[1:35:03] with tears in their eyes
[1:35:06] but that ain't what god required of you
[1:35:09] you don't have to look at the waiter and
[1:35:10] say oh
[1:35:11] please mr wade please i'm begging you
[1:35:13] i'm on my hands and he's bringing me
[1:35:15] another silverware
[1:35:17] you're the one in charge the customer is
[1:35:20] always right
[1:35:21] oh that was sweet glory all you got to
[1:35:25] do is say
[1:35:26] bring me another silverware
[1:35:30] according to the laws of that
[1:35:31] organization if you ask for it
[1:35:33] they're hired to see to your need oh
[1:35:37] god have mercy so you gotta
[1:35:40] open up your mouth
[1:35:45] oh praise the lord
[1:35:48] listen to this my oh thank you lord
[1:35:51] jesus
[1:35:53] my my my listen to this in genesis
[1:35:55] chapter 28 verse 12
[1:35:57] jacob dreams about a ladder
[1:36:00] the angels of god are ascending and
[1:36:02] descending
[1:36:03] up and down on it now jesus picks this
[1:36:05] up in john 1 51
[1:36:06] and he said very verily i say unto you
[1:36:09] hereafter
[1:36:10] you shall see heaven open
[1:36:13] and the angels of god ascending and
[1:36:15] descending upon the son of man
[1:36:19] now notice that the angels then for the
[1:36:21] new testament
[1:36:23] was given the commission
[1:36:26] to guard the lord jesus even in death if
[1:36:29] you want to see this in saint john
[1:36:31] chapter 20 verse 12 the bible said that
[1:36:35] they saw
[1:36:35] two angels sitting one at the head and
[1:36:37] the other at the foot where the body of
[1:36:39] jesus had laid do you know why they were
[1:36:41] there
[1:36:42] because david prophesied that not one
[1:36:45] cell of that holy body could corrupt so
[1:36:48] if one of them roman soldiers would have
[1:36:50] had coronavirus
[1:36:53] and spit out a coronavirus bug and they
[1:36:55] proved they got little tentacles on them
[1:36:57] like that
[1:36:57] and that little tentacle reached out and
[1:36:59] tried to get into the cells
[1:37:00] of the lord jesus one of the angels of
[1:37:02] god would have pulled a sword and
[1:37:04] cut his tentacles off
[1:37:07] even in death they were sitting there
[1:37:10] just like the rich man in lazarus the
[1:37:13] angels of god
[1:37:14] packed that rich man excuse me the
[1:37:16] lazarus
[1:37:17] packed him right to the bosom of abraham
[1:37:19] glory to god
[1:37:23] the very same angel that accompanied you
[1:37:25] accompanied you in birth
[1:37:27] when you get ready to take your last
[1:37:28] breath
[1:37:33] that angel will gather up your soul and
[1:37:36] pack you to your theophany body
[1:37:39] oh praise the lamb of god
[1:37:44] it's all around us they say i don't see
[1:37:47] nothing because you ain't looking
[1:37:50] same as right now in china right now in
[1:37:52] india right now in other parts of the
[1:37:53] world when the suns get ready to come up
[1:37:54] in a few hours
[1:37:56] there's going to be all kinds of
[1:37:57] activity going on in them countries
[1:38:00] and you'll be fast asleep it reminds me
[1:38:03] about the way the church is today
[1:38:05] they're fast asleep and can't see the
[1:38:06] supernatural moving amongst them
[1:38:09] amen but let's remember don't be
[1:38:11] sleeping virgins
[1:38:16] but be wide awake to see the calling and
[1:38:18] the coming of the lord
[1:38:21] now just a little bit just just just
[1:38:22] another minute or two i'm almost done
[1:38:25] notice now oh my thank you lord notice
[1:38:28] he tells us that the angels of the lord
[1:38:30] matthew 13
[1:38:31] were called to do two things gather the
[1:38:34] elect
[1:38:36] and sever all right now listen i'll say
[1:38:38] something to you
[1:38:40] have you ever wondered why our church
[1:38:42] services
[1:38:44] are so anemic when it comes to
[1:38:46] membership
[1:38:48] you ever stop thinking about it now you
[1:38:51] go
[1:38:51] you look at osteen's bunch they've got
[1:38:54] millions on dreaming
[1:38:55] contributing he's got tens of thousands
[1:38:57] sitting in that stadium out there
[1:39:00] do you understand why he's not so many
[1:39:02] and why message people have so few
[1:39:04] it can't be updated and our singing
[1:39:06] ain't of today
[1:39:08] huh it ain't because we're antiques
[1:39:12] but what we don't see is the angels of
[1:39:14] the lord
[1:39:16] are commissioned by god to pull in and
[1:39:19] gather
[1:39:19] only the elect in our churches
[1:39:24] and to sever out anything that is not
[1:39:26] elect
[1:39:27] you say that's the craziest thing i've
[1:39:29] ever heard might have
[1:39:30] you might have had the same opinion if
[1:39:32] you'd been sitting by the pool of
[1:39:33] bethesda all them years
[1:39:35] when one angel was commissioned by god
[1:39:37] to trouble the waters
[1:39:39] and when the waters was troubled if you
[1:39:41] got in you got your healing if the
[1:39:42] waters
[1:39:43] wasn't troubled by that angel it was
[1:39:44] just an old murky pool
[1:39:47] but when the angel did something it
[1:39:49] changed the scene
[1:39:51] change the do you understand why there's
[1:39:54] always shake-ups amongst our people
[1:39:57] because these same angels that are
[1:39:59] called of god to
[1:40:00] gather are the same angels of god called
[1:40:03] to sever
[1:40:06] they trouble things create situations
[1:40:09] let me give you an example what i mean i
[1:40:12] don't mean they're mischievous now like
[1:40:14] a bunch of elves or some kind of
[1:40:15] folklore like that
[1:40:16] but they're commissioned by god to
[1:40:18] uphold truth is that right
[1:40:19] by the word remember paul said if an
[1:40:22] angel or
[1:40:23] something comes preaches anything
[1:40:24] country let that angel be accursed
[1:40:26] so true angels of god always punctuate
[1:40:29] the word
[1:40:30] like that lady said to brother branham
[1:40:31] but man tell them man that the angel of
[1:40:33] the lord told you to baptize in jesus
[1:40:34] name he said lady
[1:40:36] your argument is thinner than the
[1:40:37] brother shadow of a chicken have been
[1:40:38] starved half to death
[1:40:40] he said if the angel of the lord would
[1:40:42] tell me something different from the
[1:40:44] bible i'd believe the bible and not the
[1:40:46] angel
[1:40:49] but they're commissioned to do things
[1:40:51] let me show you what i mean
[1:40:53] in world war 1 the 11th month the 11th
[1:40:57] hour on the 11th day
[1:41:00] the bible said the angels of god who
[1:41:03] held the four winds of the world that
[1:41:05] of the earth that means that they're the
[1:41:07] ones that control
[1:41:08] world war three
[1:41:12] the bible said that god spoke to him i'm
[1:41:14] just kind of giving you a picture here
[1:41:16] this may not be verbatim it's the jest
[1:41:17] of it
[1:41:19] and these angels of the lord and world
[1:41:21] war one stepped out on the 11th hour
[1:41:23] 11th day 11th month
[1:41:24] and said stop and the entire world
[1:41:27] stopped fighting in a moment's notice
[1:41:30] they've got that kind of authority
[1:41:33] remember oh praise the lord
[1:41:36] that the angels of the lord
[1:41:40] was also the one who had the power over
[1:41:42] euphrates
[1:41:45] when hitler eichmann mussolini stalin
[1:41:47] all the rest of them
[1:41:48] when those spirits those anointings were
[1:41:50] released
[1:41:51] remember there was angels that had power
[1:41:53] over those demons
[1:41:56] had power over those anointings they've
[1:41:59] got the authority
[1:42:00] to create wars did you know that brother
[1:42:02] baby said in victory day and sierra
[1:42:04] vesta
[1:42:05] he said that the reason you see wars on
[1:42:07] the earth is because there are demons
[1:42:09] which were once angels
[1:42:10] demons that reside and control countries
[1:42:13] one demon
[1:42:14] gets jealous of another demon and starts
[1:42:15] an influence of a war on the earth
[1:42:20] kind of reminds me what happens in
[1:42:21] churches one preacher gets jealous of
[1:42:23] another preacher and then they split and
[1:42:26] come on one singer gets jealous of
[1:42:28] another musician of another one no no no
[1:42:29] no no
[1:42:32] one's a better cook one's a better sower
[1:42:34] one's a better
[1:42:36] and they get jealous and create wars
[1:42:40] i should have been a big amen huh
[1:42:44] but the angels of god have the power to
[1:42:47] uphold the truth
[1:42:52] so if there is angels of the lord that
[1:42:55] even have
[1:42:56] what the bible said was the inkhorn you
[1:42:58] remember that
[1:43:00] the encorn was the seal of god in other
[1:43:02] words if you're going to get the holy
[1:43:03] ghost
[1:43:04] this angel of the lord come by to seal
[1:43:06] you in your forehead
[1:43:08] what do you all reckon happens in
[1:43:09] message churches
[1:43:11] whenever we're set in a pew like this
[1:43:14] the word is going forth the anointing is
[1:43:16] falling around the place the angels of
[1:43:17] the lord are here to serve us
[1:43:19] and that angel with the holy ghost in
[1:43:20] his hand goes by your pew
[1:43:22] and you're not interested
[1:43:26] he just takes his little incorn he goes
[1:43:28] to the next person
[1:43:30] he's looking for somebody that's
[1:43:31] interested in the holy ghost
[1:43:33] well if you give the holy ghost he's
[1:43:35] there to fulfill the commission of god
[1:43:37] that you can receive the holy ghost
[1:43:39] what about on the other side of that you
[1:43:42] ever notice how when somebody quits
[1:43:44] church
[1:43:45] it's like a whirlwind like something
[1:43:47] they somebody flipped a switch and all
[1:43:48] of a sudden
[1:43:49] they're gone you know what that was the
[1:43:53] angels of the lord
[1:43:55] were allowing this they were forbidden
[1:43:56] that they were creating this they were
[1:43:58] stopping that they were doing this that
[1:43:59] that that this situation that
[1:44:01] everything just started falling in place
[1:44:03] until that person either got in
[1:44:05] or got out
[1:44:10] hallelujah
[1:44:14] if a man is going to preach he better
[1:44:17] learn to preach with
[1:44:19] the angel of the lord and a gift of god
[1:44:22] because if that angel servant if his job
[1:44:26] is to serve you
[1:44:28] then that means when i've come to this
[1:44:29] platform and i for many years now
[1:44:32] i'm saying i love to sing i love play
[1:44:34] music you all know that
[1:44:35] i enjoy worshiping and singing these
[1:44:37] songs and
[1:44:39] i like putting my little parts in you
[1:44:41] know and the big endings and all that
[1:44:43] that gives me goosebumps i just love
[1:44:44] that
[1:44:45] to me i like worshiping the lord big and
[1:44:47] loud
[1:44:48] and strong and
[1:44:51] i've set up these pianos around the
[1:44:53] world and sang and played
[1:44:56] but when i walked to the platform since
[1:44:59] i've been 14 years old
[1:45:02] i can feel the presence of a person
[1:45:05] stepping behind me
[1:45:07] for many years i've wondered what that
[1:45:08] is oh you say
[1:45:10] you making yourself something sure son
[1:45:12] of god child of god
[1:45:14] on my way to heaven wraps already i
[1:45:15] don't know you just pick the title call
[1:45:16] it what you want
[1:45:20] but every time i've stepped in the
[1:45:21] platform i may not always feel it there
[1:45:23] are times that i don't
[1:45:24] necessarily feel anything begin to move
[1:45:26] like that but i've lost count of the
[1:45:28] times
[1:45:29] that i've opened up that bible and i can
[1:45:30] feel a presence stepping behind me
[1:45:33] and i wonder god why did i say that why
[1:45:36] did i preach that why did that go that
[1:45:37] way
[1:45:38] why you understand what was you're
[1:45:40] sitting in these pews with a need
[1:45:42] your needs may not necessarily be on my
[1:45:45] notes
[1:45:49] and if that angel is here to serve you
[1:45:52] and i
[1:45:52] am yielded to the holy spirit then
[1:45:55] wherever that angel is commissioned of
[1:45:56] god to serve the need
[1:45:58] he moves through the anointing the
[1:46:00] anointing moves through the gift
[1:46:01] and next thing i know i've been off my
[1:46:03] notes for 20 minutes and got no
[1:46:04] i no idea what plan of glory to god
[1:46:07] ain't got no idea what planning i'm on
[1:46:09] but i'm having a good time wherever it
[1:46:10] is
[1:46:12] why because you had a need that's what
[1:46:14] pulled a man of god off his notes
[1:46:17] you ever heard him say how did i get
[1:46:20] here
[1:46:21] next time you hear somebody brother tom
[1:46:23] or somebody say that just jump up and
[1:46:25] cut arrested glory to god
[1:46:26] you understand what it is now
[1:46:31] it means that the angel of the lord is
[1:46:32] among us
[1:46:35] that the holy spirit is in the camp
[1:46:38] closing its nine it's 8 30. i got to
[1:46:40] quit
[1:46:41] cool you got work in the morning i'm
[1:46:44] tired you're tired
[1:46:46] one more thing if the angels of the lord
[1:46:49] are here to serve us
[1:46:52] then that means that until my purpose
[1:46:55] and this life is finished
[1:46:58] there's not enough coronas or bubonic
[1:47:01] plagues
[1:47:02] or aids or cancers or anything else that
[1:47:06] can stop me
[1:47:08] from doing what god called me to do
[1:47:12] because i'm protected by a host
[1:47:15] of servants that watch over my footsteps
[1:47:19] but remember don't ask god to lead your
[1:47:21] feet if you ain't willing to move him
[1:47:25] uh because the fact of the matter is
[1:47:29] he said he'll protect the footsteps of
[1:47:30] the righteous he'll order them
[1:47:33] but you got to be willing to move a lot
[1:47:36] of times we're
[1:47:37] in such fear right all this that and the
[1:47:40] other
[1:47:40] listen i get scared too i'm diabetic
[1:47:43] okay
[1:47:44] i don't want corona because i'm one of
[1:47:46] those i'm one of those classes of people
[1:47:48] that it's dangerous for
[1:47:50] old folk and diabetic and stuff like
[1:47:52] that it scares me
[1:47:54] but every time i get in a car and i go
[1:47:56] somewhere another i wash my hands i wear
[1:47:58] my mask
[1:48:00] i've got a red mask with a red beard big
[1:48:02] red mustache you ought to see it it's
[1:48:03] quite cool
[1:48:07] i'm gonna wear one i'm gonna have some
[1:48:08] fun with it
[1:48:10] if you know anything about me at all you
[1:48:12] know that that's pretty much my
[1:48:13] personality
[1:48:16] i try to be as safe and as comfortable
[1:48:18] as i can be
[1:48:20] but i also have to remember i was i was
[1:48:22] at a meeting here a few months ago
[1:48:23] brother tom and a lady come up
[1:48:25] and she and i had my head down listening
[1:48:27] at her you know and they were playing
[1:48:28] the music and i was trying to listen and
[1:48:30] and and she said my husband died of
[1:48:32] coven when she said that she spit on my
[1:48:34] face
[1:48:36] she didn't do it on purpose you know but
[1:48:39] but john i like to die
[1:48:42] i was standing on that platform i
[1:48:43] thought oh god
[1:48:46] i'm a dead duck sure has god made green
[1:48:48] apples
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:53] but then i got to thinking about what
[1:48:54] brother banham said
[1:48:57] he said that whenever you're praying for
[1:48:58] somebody he said if you have a gift
[1:49:01] the gift stands between you and that
[1:49:03] disease he said if you don't have a gift
[1:49:06] he said that's why you anoint him with
[1:49:07] the oil
[1:49:08] anybody that knows homo gory at all
[1:49:10] knows he packs a bottle of oil in his
[1:49:12] pocket everywhere he goes because he
[1:49:13] said i don't have a gift of healing or a
[1:49:15] gift of faith
[1:49:16] he said so i anoint the sick with oil so
[1:49:18] that oil will stand between me and that
[1:49:20] disease
[1:49:21] sure this is a scary time for some
[1:49:23] people i i know we could politicize this
[1:49:26] thing the rest of the night
[1:49:27] but it's a scary time for some people my
[1:49:30] poor mother sitting home
[1:49:32] panics you know about panics about
[1:49:33] everything she's a warrior ward anyways
[1:49:36] and and some if the church got sick had
[1:49:39] an infection in their leg
[1:49:41] the lady that took the boy to the church
[1:49:43] he ended up in the hospital
[1:49:45] he had fevers and had all that kind of
[1:49:46] stuff it's from an infection his leg
[1:49:48] where he had a bad accident last year
[1:49:49] like killed him
[1:49:51] and the lady that brought him hugged by
[1:49:52] a mother and she called on the way down
[1:49:54] to church she was convinced she had
[1:49:56] corona
[1:49:57] she's a hypochondriac anyways my
[1:49:59] precious mother is a hypochondriac sure
[1:50:00] as god made
[1:50:01] i'm telling you the woman worries about
[1:50:03] everything i come in the other day and i
[1:50:05] sat down i said mom
[1:50:07] you oh god
[1:50:16] i'm saying this to make a point if we
[1:50:18] could just only
[1:50:20] open our eyes to another realm brother
[1:50:23] what we would
[1:50:24] see is that while we're out here serving
[1:50:25] in this whole world
[1:50:27] there's a host of helpers protectors
[1:50:30] gathered all the way around us
[1:50:32] hallelujah
[1:50:34] watching over our footsteps and taking
[1:50:36] care of us as we go
[1:50:38] if we could only believe it
[1:50:42] let me say it again in another land in
[1:50:44] another country in another place
[1:50:47] there's activity taking place around
[1:50:49] this old world right now
[1:50:51] i've been um most you know i graduated
[1:50:54] college february
[1:50:56] and i've been working online with
[1:50:58] colleges and other doctoral students and
[1:51:00] helping them with their work and trying
[1:51:02] to mentor them and coach them and
[1:51:03] i picked up a little old job that i've
[1:51:05] been doing and not not working it
[1:51:07] because it's anything i need the money
[1:51:08] about or nothing like that the lord's
[1:51:09] taking care of us throughout the
[1:51:10] pandemic and everything
[1:51:12] and but i did it for the online
[1:51:15] experience so that i can work my way
[1:51:17] into uh teaching college and
[1:51:20] you know because once you get these
[1:51:22] little jobs like this they're remote and
[1:51:23] then i can
[1:51:24] use that money and whatever i earn with
[1:51:26] those things and i can preach and
[1:51:28] nothing can get in the way of preaching
[1:51:29] and i can use that money for missions or
[1:51:31] other things that we have need up
[1:51:33] listen i got a girl that's a few years
[1:51:35] away from 16.
[1:51:37] somebody smile at me i need money
[1:51:41] cars are coming this is coming that's
[1:51:43] coming college is coming you know
[1:51:45] whatever
[1:51:46] and and i thought well this would be a
[1:51:49] good opportunity maybe for me to get
[1:51:50] involved
[1:51:52] in online teaching so i took a little
[1:51:54] position
[1:51:55] and and it's it's just a little tiny
[1:51:58] thing it's called vipkid and i teach
[1:52:01] chinese students how to speak english
[1:52:04] in beijing china and believe it or not
[1:52:07] this is where this message started kind
[1:52:09] of forming
[1:52:10] was when i would get up of course i got
[1:52:12] to get i got to be at four in the
[1:52:13] morning tomorrow morning teach them
[1:52:15] and we start with classes now it's after
[1:52:17] school for them when i get up
[1:52:19] now when i'm up at 10 04 tomorrow
[1:52:21] morning that fella he's like five or six
[1:52:23] o'clock
[1:52:24] after the whole day is almost expired
[1:52:27] and i got to thinking imagine that
[1:52:29] the whole time i was asleep there was
[1:52:32] activity going on
[1:52:34] and i thought oh church if we can only
[1:52:37] get ahold of that tonight
[1:52:42] how many more of our prayers are being
[1:52:43] answered right now
[1:52:45] there's things taking place i know i
[1:52:48] know i did it
[1:52:49] we are impatient we want it right now
[1:52:52] we want to be able to get a hold of it
[1:52:54] right this very moment we want to be
[1:52:55] able to say
[1:52:56] god i want to see the tangibility of it
[1:52:58] but listen to me
[1:52:59] we don't know what this dot connects to
[1:53:02] that dot the connection of that dot
[1:53:04] you don't know how many dots need to
[1:53:06] connect
[1:53:07] before your prayer can be answered
[1:53:10] that's why we have to be patient
[1:53:12] while we have to wait on the lord and
[1:53:14] say god i've asked you for it
[1:53:17] now i'm expecting that my pepsi is going
[1:53:19] to be full
[1:53:20] ketchup's going to be on the table
[1:53:24] or some of these theologians if they
[1:53:26] heard me preaching tonight what'd you
[1:53:27] learn in church
[1:53:28] get ketchup in your table
[1:53:33] theological right but god hides himself
[1:53:37] in simple things like this
[1:53:40] it's just as simple churches walking
[1:53:42] over and saying lord
[1:53:44] i heard somebody praying tonight's
[1:53:45] sister with a headache god
[1:53:47] papa i got a headache tonight but you
[1:53:50] sent an angel down to bring me comfort
[1:53:54] maybe you're hurting in your spirit you
[1:53:56] know i've come to find out
[1:53:57] there's a lot of emotional sickness
[1:54:01] god help me i'm working on some messages
[1:54:05] about how to fix these emotional
[1:54:06] problems i've got them
[1:54:10] eight years ago whenever i almost died
[1:54:11] in that motel room over diabetes that
[1:54:13] give me a little touch of ptsd i'm
[1:54:15] convinced of it
[1:54:17] certain things will happen i don't know
[1:54:18] if you're this way brother john but i i
[1:54:20] just all of a sudden i lock up and i
[1:54:21] panic
[1:54:23] it just hits me all at once every nerve
[1:54:26] in my body just stands on its end
[1:54:28] after a high prevalent i taught myself
[1:54:30] that you're okay
[1:54:32] you're okay the first year of having
[1:54:35] diabetes i'd have them little elevator
[1:54:37] type feelings that go on in your body
[1:54:39] i'd be standing the platform have one of
[1:54:41] them feelings and i'd freeze nobody knew
[1:54:42] it i didn't let nobody know
[1:54:44] i had a few of those moments up here the
[1:54:46] first few years or so
[1:54:48] you never knew it because i didn't i
[1:54:49] didn't want to i didn't want to hinder
[1:54:51] your enjoyment of the word because i was
[1:54:53] going through some little things so i
[1:54:56] just remained a good actor and kept a
[1:54:57] smile on my face and kept going
[1:55:01] but god help me i want to dig in i want
[1:55:03] you to pray with me
[1:55:05] because i'm going to start trying to
[1:55:06] travel this world if the lord open up
[1:55:08] these borders
[1:55:09] i'll get to every corner that i can get
[1:55:10] myself into
[1:55:12] and i want to find some truth and some
[1:55:14] answers in the message
[1:55:15] about how to cure these emotional
[1:55:17] diseases that are running rampant in our
[1:55:19] spirits
[1:55:20] why do you think young people are
[1:55:21] depressed why do you think people are
[1:55:23] committing suicide
[1:55:24] why do you think marriages are busting
[1:55:25] apart why do you think pastors can't
[1:55:27] keep their mind on nothing why do you
[1:55:28] think that congregations
[1:55:29] are in the biggest mess they've ever
[1:55:31] been healthiest horses can lift up the
[1:55:33] back into trucks
[1:55:35] but emotionally they're sick and
[1:55:37] crippled as a man's got three months to
[1:55:38] live
[1:55:40] come on somebody let's learn
[1:55:44] god i need help tonight
[1:55:47] i'm calling for the angels of the lord
[1:55:50] to come and assist me
[1:55:53] to come and help me if we could ever
[1:55:56] learn to call
[1:55:58] i believe we'd find that god answers a
[1:56:00] whole lot more
[1:56:01] than what we recognize he does
[1:56:04] we got to pay attention though we got to
[1:56:06] pay attention to the things that the
[1:56:08] lord does because listen friends
[1:56:10] sometimes the holy spirit moves so
[1:56:12] subtle and so
[1:56:13] sweetly and so quietly that sometimes if
[1:56:16] you're not careful you overlook it
[1:56:18] not realizing that was god all along
[1:56:20] through it
[1:56:21] hindsight is always 20 20.
[1:56:25] huh you look back on something yeah i
[1:56:28] see it now but what good did it do you
[1:56:29] just need after it happened
[1:56:33] god trained me to where that i can be so
[1:56:36] sensitive
[1:56:38] and if i ask you for something i can
[1:56:40] watch things
[1:56:41] take a step back and i can watch the
[1:56:43] holy spirit acted out
[1:56:46] right before my very eyes brother brahm
[1:56:48] said them early apostles
[1:56:49] were so sensitive to god that all the
[1:56:52] lord had to do was
[1:56:54] nod in permission and they knew it they
[1:56:56] went right to action right then
[1:56:59] god help me help me be so sensitive
[1:57:03] that i can feel the movements of the
[1:57:05] holy spirit
[1:57:06] when i pray i'll ask you a question have
[1:57:10] you ever felt
[1:57:10] so dis don't you know why we get in
[1:57:13] those conditions
[1:57:16] not just because we're human but because
[1:57:19] we have failed to step into this
[1:57:21] real position of a son and daughter of
[1:57:23] god where we can take a step in those
[1:57:25] moments take a step back and say okay
[1:57:26] god
[1:57:28] as awful as this seems somehow this is
[1:57:31] going to work out for my good
[1:57:34] and i'm calling on you to bring all the
[1:57:35] help that you can give me
[1:57:37] so that i can just sit back and watch
[1:57:39] you begin to work
[1:57:41] and do what needs to be done to solve
[1:57:42] these problems
[1:57:45] i believe if we were that sensitive
[1:57:49] i believe when we pray we wouldn't have
[1:57:51] to beat and rip at an altar
[1:57:53] now listen if you feel emotional go with
[1:57:55] what you feel
[1:57:56] i'm not telling you to choke back your
[1:57:58] emotions surely to god not
[1:58:01] that's the worst thing you can do there
[1:58:02] ain't nothing worse than a spiritual
[1:58:04] robot
[1:58:06] somebody don't know how to cry some of
[1:58:08] you big tough guys in here you know you
[1:58:10] men
[1:58:10] i never shed no tear you big
[1:58:14] real men cry
[1:58:17] they do matter of fact brother said the
[1:58:20] only emotion jesus ever showed was he
[1:58:22] cried
[1:58:26] we hold ourselves into such a place to
[1:58:28] where we don't even know how to express
[1:58:29] ourself
[1:58:31] i agree we get so emotional we get
[1:58:33] overwhelmed sometimes
[1:58:34] too emotional let your emotion flow
[1:58:38] but while you're emotional take a step
[1:58:40] back and say okay lord
[1:58:42] if you've placed waiters at my beck and
[1:58:44] call
[1:58:46] then i'm asking for you to bring
[1:58:47] somebody to fix this situation
[1:58:49] somebody to give me guidance here
[1:58:52] somebody to help me deal with that
[1:58:54] somebody to go deal with that son or
[1:58:56] that daughter or that husband or that
[1:58:57] wife or that grandkid
[1:58:58] somebody to deal these problems so i can
[1:59:01] come out on top of this whole thing's
[1:59:03] over with
[1:59:05] not come on on top to be arrogant not to
[1:59:07] be smart
[1:59:08] but to be a conqueror with humility
[1:59:12] and grace to be able to weather all the
[1:59:15] storms
[1:59:16] and say greater is he this in me
[1:59:19] than he that's in the world ministry
[1:59:23] of angels i'm so glad they're around
[1:59:26] [Laughter]
[1:59:29] i wonder if i was to ask you tonight to
[1:59:31] testify
[1:59:32] you could just do so by raising your
[1:59:33] hand how many had those experiences
[1:59:35] where you could have been killed
[1:59:37] something happened changed it turned it
[1:59:38] around
[1:59:40] just look around at yourself
[1:59:43] you ever had that moment when something
[1:59:46] was going that way and all of a sudden
[1:59:47] it went
[1:59:48] [Music]
[1:59:50] you think boy thank you lord yes thank
[1:59:52] you lord
[1:59:54] we give credit where credit is due thank
[1:59:56] you jesus we
[1:59:57] worship jesus but thank you angels
[2:00:03] thank you for being at your post of duty
[2:00:07] [Laughter]
[2:00:10] one more thing when brother brown was in
[2:00:14] that cave
[2:00:15] and the angel of the lord came and
[2:00:17] learned the message that he was
[2:00:18] commissioned
[2:00:19] to get this is my last point and we're
[2:00:22] gonna quit
[2:00:26] i had a brother asked me one time him
[2:00:28] and his wife
[2:00:30] brother ben i heard what you preach
[2:00:36] why he said because he said sure tell me
[2:00:40] what is it i'll try to help you
[2:00:42] he said if i'm in the bathroom or if i'm
[2:00:45] embarrassing a situation
[2:00:47] or a personal private situation i don't
[2:00:49] want no angel looking at me
[2:00:52] i said i'm so glad you brought it up to
[2:00:53] me i'm going to tell you the answer if
[2:00:55] you want it he said i do
[2:00:57] i said have you ever been at a
[2:00:58] restaurant and tried to engage in a
[2:01:00] serious conversation with somebody i
[2:01:02] said yeah i said does a real
[2:01:04] genuine respectful trained waiter stand
[2:01:07] there and take note of your whole
[2:01:08] conversation and pay attention to
[2:01:09] everything you're doing
[2:01:10] he goes no i said what did they do
[2:01:14] i said they go stand in the corner and
[2:01:15] mind their own business until it's time
[2:01:17] to serve again
[2:01:19] i said i want to let you know something
[2:01:20] even though these angels of the lord
[2:01:23] even though they surround us never
[2:01:29] my friend we laugh but there are people
[2:01:31] i had a sister tell me my wife one time
[2:01:33] she said i don't like that i've always
[2:01:36] had a problem with people looking at me
[2:01:38] and then you preached angels watching us
[2:01:40] she said oh god
[2:01:43] she said if i'm changing clothes i don't
[2:01:44] want no angel and i told her the thing
[2:01:46] about
[2:01:49] business until you've changed into your
[2:01:51] nightgown or whatever
[2:01:53] that is it's funny i agree but for some
[2:01:56] people they get this kind of stuff in
[2:01:57] their mind
[2:01:58] remember they're servants they're
[2:02:02] servants
[2:02:03] they're not there to interrupt they're
[2:02:05] not there to intrude
[2:02:07] and if you break the word of god don't
[2:02:09] expect an angel of the lord to step in
[2:02:11] and save your hide
[2:02:13] they follow numbers and the orders is
[2:02:16] the word
[2:02:18] the commission comes from god and they
[2:02:20] follow that to the letter
[2:02:23] stand with me not everybody's smiling so
[2:02:30] big
[2:02:33] some of you were saying watch me in the
[2:02:34] bathroom yeah that's what she said
[2:02:38] i was genuinely worried about it
[2:02:47] amen let's sing something buddy let's
[2:02:49] worship the lord a moment before we go
[2:02:52] now with everything i preached to you
[2:02:55] tonight
[2:02:56] do you believe what i said to you is the
[2:02:58] truth
[2:03:00] believe it come from the message from
[2:03:01] the bible it's not brother ben's words
[2:03:03] is it
[2:03:04] just telling you what he already told us
[2:03:06] in his message
[2:03:08] now this is what i want you to do i
[2:03:11] could stand here
[2:03:11] for some kind of an emotional thing
[2:03:15] i'd rather leave this night
[2:03:22] with you going home pretty aware much
[2:03:26] conscious start
[2:03:28] thinking about the message tomorrow when
[2:03:31] you wake up and the message comes on
[2:03:32] your mind
[2:03:33] i want you to start identifying with
[2:03:34] what's been said
[2:03:36] i am a son of god i am a daughter of god
[2:03:39] if i need help all i have to do is call
[2:03:42] for it

[2:03:45] you up into some
[2:03:46] try to beg you to believe this you're
[2:03:48] either going to believe it
[2:03:50] or you ain't going to believe it when
[2:03:52] you go to bed at night wake up tomorrow
