[18:00] good morning brothers and
[18:04] sisters fancy new pull pit up here
[18:06] that's really nice let's
[18:10] see if we'll just uh you can be
[18:18] seated we're just going to go in the
[18:20] scriptures this thought came we were at
[18:22] a church down in Sarasota last weekend
[18:24] and he was preaching on this uh but was
[18:28] on Abraham and
[18:30] Sarah and it was on
[18:33] God uh finding a need in his people and
[18:37] uh it's a little let's see here you you
[18:41] go with me if you want to the
[18:43] revelations let's see pull
[18:47] this Revelations
[18:57] 3
[18:59] and we'll do uh star in verse 14 this is
[19:02] a familiar
[19:05] scripture to us and this is where we are
[19:07] in the church and unto the angel of the
[19:09] Church of the Lans write these things
[19:11] sayith amen the faithful and the true
[19:13] witness the beginning of because thou
[19:15] sayest I am rich and increased with
[19:17] goods and have need of nothing and
[19:19] knowest not that thou art wretched and
[19:21] miserable and poor and blind and
[19:23] naked counsel the to by me gold tried in
[19:26] the fire thou mayest be rich in white
[19:29] rment that thou mayest be clothed and
[19:30] that thy shame of thy nakedness do not
[19:32] appear and anoint th eyes with isaf that
[19:35] thou mayest see and he goes on to tell
[19:38] them as I as many as I love are rebuke
[19:40] and chasen be zealous therefore and
[19:42] repent behold I stand at the door and
[19:45] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[19:47] the door I will come into him and will
[19:49] St with him and he with me to him that
[19:53] overcometh will overcame and him sit
[19:55] down with my father and his throne that
[19:57] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[19:59] the spirit saith unto the
[20:01] churches and just speaking this is where
[20:03] we are speaking of where we are in the
[20:05] world today we're uh in a world that
[20:08] doesn't really have many needs they do
[20:11] have needs they don't just know they
[20:12] have needs but they're rich they're
[20:14] increased with knowledge they have say I
[20:17] think it was this morning he was saying
[20:19] how uh when they went to uh build the
[20:21] Tabernacle there that uh I I forget
[20:25] exactly how he said he said maybe they
[20:27] they uh between all of them at the
[20:29] church there they might had I think he
[20:31] said maybe 30 cents but the Lord helped
[20:34] them build that Tabernacle but it's just
[20:36] a day and age that's increased with
[20:38] everything and uh and that's kind of the
[20:41] human nature being increased with
[20:43] everything everyone wants to be
[20:46] self-sufficient uh everyone you know is
[20:48] a a a self-made person or a self-made
[20:51] man not dependent on anyone or anything
[20:53] not dependent on God and uh that's a
[20:58] scary place especially spiritual to be
[21:00] uh you know be careful when things are
[21:03] that way or that easy because then one
[21:05] finds self not calling on God or not
[21:07] depending on God not calling after to
[21:10] him or not
[21:12] having any
[21:14] needs and Moses spoke of it there in
[21:16] Deuteronomy and uh oh it's Deuteronomy 6
[21:19] I'll just read it here in verse 10 and
[21:23] it he said and it shall be when the Lord
[21:25] thy God shall have brought thee in the
[21:28] land which he swear unto thy fathers to
[21:30] Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give
[21:32] thee great and goodly cities which thou
[21:34] buildest not and houses full of all good
[21:37] things which thou fillest not and Wells
[21:40] digged which thou dig digest not
[21:43] Vineyards and olive trees which thou
[21:44] planted not when thou shalt have eaten
[21:47] and be full he said then beware lest
[21:51] thou forget the Lord which brought thee
[21:53] forth out of the land of Egypt from the
[21:54] house of
[21:56] bondage and um living in that day and
[21:59] age is totally opposite of what God you
[22:02] know I guess intended for
[22:04] humans uh this lady oan age back in
[22:09] Genesis 15 he goes to Abraham and it
[22:12] just stood out to me so much when the
[22:14] brother there had brought it out uh it's
[22:17] in Genesis
[22:18] 15 and we'll go there if you want to go
[22:22] there you can if not I'll just read it
[22:23] to
[22:24] you after this it's Genesis 15 after
[22:28] this the word of the Lord came to
[22:29] Abraham in Aion do not be afraid Abraham
[22:32] I'm your Shield your very great
[22:35] reward and Abraham said Sovereign Lord
[22:37] what can you give me since I remain
[22:39] childless the one who inherit my estate
[22:42] is elazer of Damascus and Abraham said
[22:46] and Abram said you have given me no
[22:49] children so a servant in my household
[22:51] would be my Heir then the Lord word of
[22:54] the Lord came to him this man will not
[22:56] be the your Heir but a son who is your
[22:58] own flesh and blood will be your Heir
[23:01] and he took him outside and said look up
[23:03] at the sky and count the Stars if indeed
[23:05] you can count them he said unto him so
[23:07] shall your Offspring be Abram believed
[23:10] the Lord and He credited it to him as
[23:12] righteousness he also said to him I am
[23:14] the Lord who brought you out of the her
[23:16] of the Chans to give you this land and
[23:17] take possession of it abam said
[23:19] Sovereign Lord how can I know that this
[23:22] that I will gain possession of this so
[23:25] the Lord said to him bring me a heer a
[23:27] goat a ram each three years old along
[23:29] with a dove and a young pigeon abam
[23:32] brought all these things all these to
[23:34] him cut them into and arranged in halves
[23:36] opposite of each other the birds however
[23:38] he did not cut in half and the birds in
[23:40] the prey came down on the carcasses but
[23:42] Abraham drove them
[23:44] away and as the sun was setting Abraham
[23:46] fell into a deep sleep and a thick
[23:49] Dreadful Darkness came up over him and
[23:51] the Lord said unto him know for certain
[23:53] that for 400 years your descendants
[23:55] would be strangers in the country of
[23:57] Their Own
[23:59] not their own and that they will be
[24:02] enslaved Mis slaved and mistreated there
[24:05] but I will punish the nation they they
[24:07] serve as slaves and afterward they would
[24:08] come out with a great
[24:11] possession and uh let's see skip down
[24:14] here just a little bit when the sun had
[24:15] set and darkness had fallen a smoking
[24:17] fire pot with blazing torch appeared and
[24:18] pass between the pieces on that day the
[24:21] Lord made Covenant with Abraham said to
[24:22] your descendants I give this land from
[24:25] the from the K but uh of this of Egypt
[24:29] to the Great River of
[24:31] Euphrates and uh brother Brenham said
[24:34] let's see if I can find it here brother
[24:36] Brenham was saying here about Abraham
[24:39] talking about Abraham had a need of of a
[24:43] Heir and uh let's see
[24:48] here well notice he said what he did oh
[24:51] it's marvelous he kept the birds off of
[24:53] it so Abraham's job was to keep the
[24:54] birds off it it wasn't to change it
[24:56] wasn't to change what God told him to
[24:58] bring it wasn't to do things differently
[25:00] than what God told him but it was to
[25:01] keep the the vultures away from what he
[25:04] had laid out for the
[25:06] sacrifice he said you keep the birds off
[25:08] until the sun went down notice then a
[25:10] deep sleep fell on Abraham first thing
[25:13] brother Bram says Abraham Abraham I'm
[25:15] just going to shut you off to show you
[25:17] there's not one thing you can do about
[25:19] it this is my Covenant and it wasn't one
[25:22] thing brother that you could do about it
[25:24] it isn't one thing sister that you done
[25:26] about it it's what God did for you in
[25:29] Christ not because you was good not
[25:32] because a a mother was good but what
[25:35] Christ was good and what Christ did by
[25:37] calling you put him then he says he put
[25:41] him to sleep now he hasn't got anything
[25:43] to do with it so after he went to sleep
[25:45] then there come down a real deep
[25:47] horrible Darkness what did that mean he
[25:49] said brother said hell separation every
[25:51] sinner deserves it separation and then
[25:53] beyond that was a burning furnace death
[25:55] separation hell after that I think I'm
[25:59] but then beyond that there went a little
[26:00] white light I hope you never disbelieve
[26:03] no more from this
[26:04] hour Abraham asleep and in a vision
[26:07] showing that every man must come in this
[26:10] horrible darkness of Separation death
[26:13] that every man deserves to go to hell
[26:15] because he's a sinner he fell he's The
[26:17] Offspring of a sinner and then beyond
[26:19] that went a little white light in other
[26:21] words the same pillar of power that
[26:22] followed Israel the same Holy Spirit
[26:25] that's here today and it went right in
[26:27] between each one of those sacrifices God
[26:29] confirming by his grace some someday
[26:32] that he would do what he would do in
[26:34] Jesus Christ now to the oath God took an
[26:37] oath over it and he took an oath tonight
[26:39] swore by himself that none other greater
[26:42] to swear by he swore by himself he'd
[26:45] keep his word amen he he will keep his
[26:47] promise he didn't only say it but he
[26:49] swore to it he'd do it what are you
[26:52] trying to do brother Brenham brother bam
[26:54] says get you to a place where you can
[26:57] see what God has done for you that's why
[26:59] these things take place God has promised
[27:01] to do them he's got to do them in order
[27:04] to be God he's got to keep his
[27:07] promises and uh let's
[27:10] see but uh what it is is we live in a
[27:14] self-sufficient age where everybody
[27:16] doesn't have need to nothing or but but
[27:18] you know as a as a Believer as the
[27:20] Church of the Living God we have needs
[27:23] and we have needs amongst the people
[27:25] this morning I'm sure I their sickness
[27:28] some need healing in their bodies some
[27:30] need healing maybe in uh Financial
[27:34] situations or decisions I know I need I
[27:36] have many needs seems like all the time
[27:40] with needs but uh but that's what God's
[27:43] looking for you know as human as human
[27:45] uh nature is we we'd pick the biggest
[27:48] and the best person to do the job if if
[27:51] you're look going for a job interview or
[27:53] something they're going to pick you on
[27:54] your credentials maybe if you went to
[27:56] school at a certain certain place or
[27:58] this or that smarts or if you're looking
[28:00] for a basketball team or the children
[28:02] are you know going to play basketball
[28:04] they're going to look for the person
[28:05] that's best in basketball that maybe the
[28:07] tallest or maybe the strongest that's
[28:09] not what God's looking
[28:11] for God uh showed it when he picked
[28:15] David uh Samuel went down there to
[28:17] anoint a king and he had all the
[28:19] brothers out there you know all the
[28:21] strong strapping boys maybe military
[28:24] even did some military time already all
[28:27] them out there lined up to be anointed
[28:29] king and Samuel said he God said he's
[28:34] not even they said he's not even here
[28:35] he's still still out on the back hill
[28:37] there with the Sheep they didn't even
[28:38] bother to go get him to be anointed king
[28:41] but God doesn't look on the outside God
[28:43] looks on the inside of man and that
[28:47] stood out to me so much because that's
[28:49] what we need that's what I need you know
[28:52] we always think well we got to be this
[28:53] or we got to be that you ain't got to be
[28:55] nothing you have to be an a person that
[28:58] is in need for God to meet your need
[29:00] then you have to latch on to the promise
[29:02] of what God gave his word and never let
[29:05] it go with Abraham he was promised a
[29:09] child and Heir and and uh Sarah and
[29:14] Hagar gotten you know together and they
[29:16] they came up with the idea to have Hagar
[29:19] go into him and she did conceive and she
[29:22] produced uh ishol a wild man never to Be
[29:26] Tamed and that's what happens a lot of
[29:28] times with us when we have a promise we
[29:32] we might have some of our own ideas in
[29:34] there or some of our own ideas or we
[29:39] some a lot of times get
[29:40] impatient that's not what we we're
[29:42] supposed to do not getting patient we're
[29:44] supposed to believe if we're Believers
[29:46] we believe and we hang on to the
[29:47] promises of God and he'll bring you
[29:49] through to the other side we don't have
[29:51] to have it all figured out because a lot
[29:53] of times in our own carnal thinking we
[29:54] can't figure it out but if we just stick
[29:57] with his word and in his word he'll
[29:59] bring us through to the other
[30:01] side uh brother

[1:03:39] this may God add His blessings to the
[1:03:41] reading of the word you can be seated
[1:03:43] this morning you know I was just praying
[1:03:46] in my just really couldn't find anything
[1:03:49] to minister on I was just waiting and
[1:03:52] sometimes I'll just study or I'll read
[1:03:54] and just pray and then amen and and and
[1:03:56] I begin to think about I guess today
[1:03:59] it's supposed to be the Super Bowl right
[1:04:02] amen I think brother Joe mentioned it
[1:04:03] you know and it's the the highlight of
[1:04:06] football amen and it's called the Super
[1:04:08] Bowl a that right and I got to thinking
[1:04:11] about that a little bit talk a lot about
[1:04:13] that word super amen Super Bowl you know
[1:04:17] I man my mind just got to going and the
[1:04:19] God be anointed so I just went down that
[1:04:21] road and amen so this morning we're just
[1:04:23] going to call it call this message this
[1:04:25] morning
[1:04:27] super would that be all right we're
[1:04:29] going to call this message this morning
[1:04:31] with the help of the Lord amen super
[1:04:33] because it's uh if you'll notice and I I
[1:04:36] I know that brother Brandon many times
[1:04:38] he could take a a ball game he could
[1:04:40] take just about anything in natural and
[1:04:43] type type the natural with the spiritual
[1:04:45] is that right amen and we know that in
[1:04:47] this super bow that amen this is the uh
[1:04:51] highlight of it all this is the U what
[1:04:53] what you the climax isn't that right the
[1:04:56] grand finale amen and you know in order
[1:04:59] to for them to have gotten here they had
[1:05:02] to fight a lot of
[1:05:04] battles they had to play a lot of games
[1:05:06] they had a lot of adversity amen and
[1:05:09] amen and we know that to be in this amen
[1:05:12] you know and I thought about Luther
[1:05:14] Luther maybe Luther and Wesley's time
[1:05:16] being like the regular season you know
[1:05:18] and it ain't you know some sometimes
[1:05:21] teams go to whole season and never win
[1:05:23] one game right you know maybe one or two
[1:05:26] wins and boy that's that's just they
[1:05:28] don't teams like that don't make the
[1:05:31] playoffs isin that right so it's the
[1:05:33] first stage is the the battle for the
[1:05:35] playoffs you know and and only so many
[1:05:38] will make it it into that playoffs and
[1:05:40] so forth and the next phase maybe you
[1:05:42] know it's finally we get into the
[1:05:44] playoffs isn't that right and then we
[1:05:45] maybe Ty back with Pentecost amen they
[1:05:48] were in the playoffs and in there amen
[1:05:50] they eliminate anybody that is inferior
[1:05:54] in any way if you have a bad day you're
[1:05:56] going to be
[1:05:57] out amen and so they get rid of the
[1:06:01] weaker ones and of course you know with
[1:06:02] Luther like brother bam said you know he
[1:06:04] still drank a little he smoked a little
[1:06:06] they was far from Perfection isn't that
[1:06:08] right they're far from Perfection and
[1:06:10] next you know in the order to be in that
[1:06:12] that the playoffs you got to be a little
[1:06:14] bit better and you got to be in the a
[1:06:15] little bit higher class and so forth you
[1:06:17] know but if you can make a I don't know
[1:06:19] how many times you'll have to play but
[1:06:21] you know it's in that final four games
[1:06:23] that it's really really gets little
[1:06:25] stressed out and tense you know when
[1:06:26] there's four teams playing it's coming
[1:06:28] down to four now and then it'll go down
[1:06:30] to two and and they battle it out right
[1:06:34] amen we can say that playoffs down to
[1:06:36] the very nitty gritt came right up close
[1:06:38] to it amen and we know Pentecost was RA
[1:06:41] just about like it I mean it looked like
[1:06:43] the church it looked like Christ it was
[1:06:45] looking like the original Church am man
[1:06:48] it was about as good a football team as
[1:06:49] they going to be a that right but you
[1:06:52] know but you know know they that they
[1:06:54] fought it out and now the ones that win
[1:06:57] that the last final two amen and now
[1:07:00] they go into the Super Bowl they
[1:07:02] considered the very best of the very
[1:07:07] best amen and how many believe that
[1:07:10] that's God is saving I believe he's
[1:07:12] saving the best for last amen you might
[1:07:16] not think much of yourself but God chose
[1:07:19] you God chose me Amen to fight devil in
[1:07:24] this hour to come against our adversary
[1:07:28] amen and we're going to have a absolute
[1:07:30] Showdown as the prophet of God said
[1:07:32] anden there's a mount show down there
[1:07:35] with transfigure uh figuration Showdown

[1:39:35] has got today is history what Moody said
[1:39:37] sany said finny said Smith said it's a
[1:39:40] history but God still lives just as he
[1:39:42] did always it's a history We Begin well
[1:39:46] we begin in 1909 way back in Luther's
[1:39:48] time we begin oh my God he says God
[1:39:51] never did begin and he will never end
[1:39:54] everything that has a beginning has an
[1:39:55] end but those who have never had a
[1:39:57] beginning they don't have no end that's
[1:39:59] a it's a matter with so much
[1:40:01] achievements that we make in the world
[1:40:03] towards building our crops denomination
[1:40:05] buildings and structures they all begin
[1:40:07] and they come to an end and we all
[1:40:09] beginning and an end but when we receive
[1:40:11] Christ we receive God God is eternal and
[1:40:13] we become Eternal and God through Spirit
[1:40:16] which never did begin and never will end
[1:40:21] don't let that depart from you keep it
[1:40:23] in your minds and your hearts fresh as
[1:40:26] long as you live every manmade
[1:40:29] achievement Must

[1:40:33] was in Adam is that something how we
[1:40:36] were try this and we will try that man
[1:40:40] will try this and man will try that when
[1:40:43] God has the correct way every manmade
[1:40:47] achievement anything that pump anybody
[1:40:49] does or tries to achieve in the flesh
[1:40:52] will
[1:40:54] fail
[1:40:56] amen that anything that's done in the
[1:41:00] flesh one place there in the church book
[1:41:04] brother Adam says those in the bride you
[1:41:06] know they they know what the will of God
[1:41:09] is they have thus sayith the Lord or
[1:41:11] they keep
[1:41:13] still how many believes it's better not
[1:41:15] to do nothing than to try to do
[1:41:18] something that's not in the will of God
[1:41:21] but people can't wait on God people
[1:41:23] can't pray about stuff committed to God
[1:41:24] no we got to get our hands on and make
[1:41:26] this happen make that happen no don't do
[1:41:29] that oh
[1:41:31] my when we try to live our own
[1:41:33] lives amen do our own thing get our own
[1:41:37] thoughts involved in
[1:41:40] it amen I think most prayer this morning
[1:41:43] talking about sometimes we still have
[1:41:44] our own we still have things in front of
[1:41:46] God that we don't even
[1:41:48] realize
[1:41:49] amen how many beli God's first in
[1:41:53] everything amen all
[1:41:56] right praise the Lord you love
[1:42:01] him all
[1:42:06] right Romans 8 and then also we'll go
[1:42:10] to um let me see
[1:42:18] here 1 Corinthians 1
[1:42:21] 25 1 Corinthians 1:25 says because of
[1:42:24] the foolishness of God is wiser than men
[1:42:26] and the weakness of God is stronger than
[1:42:29] men first of all when you begin to think
[1:42:31] about God remember this what is it that
[1:42:35] makes God great or
[1:42:39] super huh before you can become a
[1:42:43] Superman you got to look at the Superman
[1:42:45] and how he became Superman what makes
[1:42:47] him Superman God of all the universe
[1:42:51] come down and according to the super
[1:42:54] sign the super sign was that a virgin
[1:42:57] shall
[1:42:58] conceive he was born in a manger in a
[1:43:00] stable of hay isn't that right and that
[1:43:03] was the super super super super
[1:43:07] sign
[1:43:09] amen and that humility God what makes
[1:43:13] him so great is that come and humble
[1:43:17] himself humble
[1:43:19] himself
[1:43:23] can I just say what comes to mind you
[1:43:26] know I don't care how long I've been a
[1:43:28] Christian but I believe there's still a
[1:43:29] lot of room in Thomas berer to Humble
[1:43:32] himself more
[1:43:37] yet I think every one of us could say
[1:43:39] the same thing humble
[1:43:43] yourself and I want to say something
[1:43:45] else if you ever come to the end of
[1:43:48] yourself you whip yourself you'll only
[1:43:50] do it by God's grace through his faith
[1:43:54] amen you'll never you'll never whip
[1:43:57] Yourself by
[1:43:58] yourself it takes the grace of God it
[1:44:00] takes surrendering of yourself to him
[1:44:04] and if you ever conquer the biggest
[1:44:07] enemy that you'll ever face is
[1:44:11] yourself it's ourselves it's our carnal
[1:44:14] mind it's our own thinking and it's our
[1:44:16] own ways it's our own selfishness it's
[1:44:20] our own GED
[1:44:22] that's the biggest enemy that we have if
[1:44:25] you conquer that I'm telling you what
[1:44:27] you won the Super
[1:44:30] Bowl you won the Super Bowl if you ever
[1:44:34] equi that amen didn't Better B him say
[1:44:38] one place he says you know if you can
[1:44:40] whip yourself if you can C yourself and
[1:44:42] surrender yourself to God you got more
[1:44:44] power than to build a guy that can do a
[1:44:46] flip run the run the aisles run all over
[1:44:49] Scream and Shout speaking in Tong and
[1:44:50] everything else cuz a lot of them guys
[1:44:52] didn't even conquer themselves but if
[1:44:54] you conquer yourself if you surrender
[1:44:56] yourself to almighty God you got more
[1:44:59] power than then than that guy
[1:45:01] does Amen because it takes a lot to die
[1:45:04] to
[1:45:06] yourself Amen to humble
[1:45:10] yourself
[1:45:11] amen he was the perfect illustration
[1:45:14] Jesus was of being
[1:45:17] super first of all in a manure as
[1:45:21] brother B said born on a manure pile how
[1:45:24] many preachers would like to come up
[1:45:26] here and say yeah well I want to tell
[1:45:27] you where I was born at I was born in a
[1:45:29] barn over a manure pile
[1:45:33] yeah they didn't have any room for me at
[1:45:35] the hotel they put me out in the stall
[1:45:38] and I was born out
[1:45:41] there oh well where do you live well I
[1:45:45] don't really have a home you know I got
[1:45:47] to go get some money out of the fish's
[1:45:49] mouth to pay my taxes say I you know my
[1:45:52] head
[1:45:53] next what you ain't got no house you
[1:45:55] ain't got no bank
[1:45:57] account no not a
[1:46:00] dime
[1:46:02] huh my my
[1:46:06] my when he came to Simon's house invited
[1:46:09] for
[1:46:10] dinner and I've got a question that came
[1:46:12] to my mind I don't if anybody here can
[1:46:15] answer
[1:46:18] it but when he was invited to Simon
[1:46:20] house and he didn't wash his feet he
[1:46:21] wasn't
[1:46:24] welcomed I wonder how many of us the
[1:46:27] tradition is they will wash your
[1:46:29] feet they wash you and they anoint you
[1:46:32] and all of that they welcome you but he
[1:46:35] just sat back there a probably sat
[1:46:37] making fun of him sitting there no doubt
[1:46:40] but Simon Says now foot what Funk when
[1:46:42] he comes don't you dare wash his feet
[1:46:44] you just stay over here on the corner of
[1:46:45] somewhere or you go find something else
[1:46:47] to do somewhere else you leave him
[1:46:49] sitting there
[1:46:51] there he sat is that
[1:46:54] right there he
[1:46:56] sat but in the working of
[1:46:58] God in the working of God he brought
[1:47:02] Mary isn't that right a
[1:47:05] prostitute to come wash his
[1:47:08] feet to wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:47:11] head to cry wash her with her tears
[1:47:15] watch his feet with your
[1:47:17] tears that's
[1:47:19] right
[1:47:21] but the question was that I wanted to
[1:47:23] ask you after that episode did he stay
[1:47:26] and eat with him or did he
[1:47:32] leave I don't know Tommy I don't know
[1:47:36] but after he said Simon I have somewhat
[1:47:38] to say again to you you know when I came
[1:47:41] here you did wash my feet you didn't
[1:47:43] welcome me this out of the other and
[1:47:45] this woman since I've there did not seee
[1:47:47] to wash my face and anoy my head amen
[1:47:51] that's about as far as we
[1:47:53] know but I just can't imagine Jesus
[1:47:55] sitting there with the Pharisees neing
[1:47:58] with him maybe he did maybe he didn't if
[1:48:00] you know the answer let me know I'd like
[1:48:02] to know but what a humiliation ain't
[1:48:05] that right he didn't man standing there
[1:48:07] and being in
[1:48:09] humiliation how manyan knows when people
[1:48:11] humiliate you don't be intimidated know
[1:48:13] who you are amen Peter says you know if
[1:48:17] you suffer wrongfully you know be glad
[1:48:20] Rejoice because you got in heaven is
[1:48:23] that
[1:48:29] right what makes us
[1:48:32] super what makes us super what made
[1:48:35] Jesus super amen one place he says he
[1:48:39] that is the greatest he that is super
[1:48:41] among you shall be your
[1:48:44] servant a little further up from that he
[1:48:46] says he says Pharisees the all all the
[1:48:49] works that they do is to be seen of men
[1:48:51] they make broad their flat factories and
[1:48:54] enlarge the borders of their garments
[1:48:56] and love the uppermost rooms of that the
