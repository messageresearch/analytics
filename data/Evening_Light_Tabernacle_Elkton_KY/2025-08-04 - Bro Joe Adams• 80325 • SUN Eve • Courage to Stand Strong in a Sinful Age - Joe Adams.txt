This for is from a long time ago and I found this in my song book tonight and I asked brother Thomas if I could read it and he said yes. Says, "Please remember us in prayer for traveling Friday as we are going to Louisville to a bone cancer specialist. He will look at the disc and probably just talk to us what what to us the probably will have to go back next week for a biopsy to to determine if I have cancer or not. She says, "I had a sister in our church tell me one day this week say this week said,"Lord, you healed brother Brandham's wife when she had the tumor on her side." Brother Brandham said before the doctors touch her she will be healed. And the sister said Lord if you could do that for brother Brandham's wife you can do that for sister Anne. Now a lot of you young people may not know sister an sister Hannah wrote this to her. How many years ago has that been sister Hannah? Maybe 10. At least 10. I found this today and I told brother Thomas that's what we do. Do we encourage one another? We're in a battle cuz we're in a battle tonight. All of us has got issues. You got problems. But you know what? We're here to pray for you, to pray with you. And we got an awesome God that answers. We're going to sing that song, Keep on the Firing line.

We're going to enter into the the best part. Now, let's sing that little chorus as Brother Joe comes. Shut in with God in a secret place. Is that your desire tonight? Oh, shut in with God in a secret place. There in the spirit beholding his face, gaining new power to run in the race. I long to be shut in with God. Amen. Is that your desire this evening to be shut in with him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer. Father, Lord, we just thank you for the opportunity you give us to worship you, Lord, to love you, Father, and to be loved by you. Thank you for your grace, Lord, you've extended to us. Thank you for the message you brought our way, Lord. You turned us from unbelief to believing, Lord. You turn us from sin, Lord, and being repbates to being sons and daughters of God. What a great privilege we have to, Lord, to know who we are in this hour, in this age, Lord, and knowing that shortly, Lord, these robes of humanity are going to fall aside, Lord, and we're going to take on new bodies, Lord. A body like your own glorious body transformed in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, Lord. Father, what a great day that's going to be. So Lord, we just commit our lives to you aresh tonight. Lord, as this is a young people's service, I believe we're all young at heart. No matter, Lord, what our ages are, Lord, believe we all can take away something from the word tonight. But Lord, we just want to just speak a few minutes to the youth here that's in this hour, in this day and age, Lord, knowing that they fight many difficulties and they face many battles that we didn't face, Lord, at their age. And we just pray Lord you give him strength, courage and guidance. Father, now may you bless the word as it comes forth. Lord, I ask you open my mouth to the things of God and shut it to the the things of humanity. Lord, may only those things that will bless your people come forth. Father, we love you and we just commit this service to you in Jesus name. And if you have your Bibles tonight, we're going to look here in the book of Daniel. Just want to appreciate brother Thomas. Yeah. Thank you to uh I didn't reach him ahead of time just to kind of ask him if he was okay with me directing this evening service to the young people. So I just appreciate the liberty we have to be able to to do that this this evening rather. Young people, I want to speak to you on courage to stand strong in a sinful age. Courage to stand strong in a sinful age. Now, many of you are going to be going back to school here within the next week, two weeks, 3 weeks. Uh many of us are going back to jobs situations. Uh there's a youth camp next week. But I just want something that will anchor you tonight to know that God has equipped us with courage and he's equipped us to be able to stand in this evil hour. We look here in the book of Daniel uh chapter 6 and verse one. and said, "It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 princes, which should be over the whole kingdom, and over these three presidents, of whom Daniel was first, that the princes might give an account unto them, and the king should have no damage." Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes. Notice why. Because he had an excellent spirit was in him. and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom, but they could find no occasion nor fault, for so much as he was faithful, neither was any error or fault found in him. Then said these men, "We shall not find any occasion against Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God." Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and they said, "Thus unto him, King Darius live forever, and all the presidents of the kingdom, governors, princes, counselors, and captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask petition," that word there is prayer or request, of any god or man, for 30 days, save thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. Now, oh king, established a decree and sign the writing that it may be that it may not be changed according to the law of the Mes and Persians which alter it not. Wherefore the king Darius signed it the writing and a decree. Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem. He kneled upon his knees three times a day and he prayed and he gave thanks before his God as he did a four time. God bless you. You can have your seats this evening. Good to see all these young people up front. Young and young and some of the young young ones are going. All right. Well, let's just get into I go to my timer. Let me set my timer so I don't overextend myself tonight. There we go. Amen. So, we just kind of want to take this thought of courage to stand strong in a sinful age. And we look at the word courage here. And I'm just going to take my time this this evening rather. Courage is the ability to do something that frightens one is uh is to have strength in fa in the face of pain and grief. Now, we think about courage sometimes if we're not mistaken. We we kind of mix up bravery and courage. But there's a huge difference between being brave and being courageous. See, and it all lies in the attitude in which we approach a challenge or a task. Being brave is often an impulse decision. While unlocking courage involves intentional planning and action, you know, somebody threatens your wife, you can be brave. It's an instant. It's, you know, something happens. But to have courage means you see the long range plan and you go toward it anyway. So bravery is often seen as taking on a challenge head on without fear. But it also involves recognizing potential opportunities and having the courage to pursue them despite of any obstacles that may arise. On the other hand, courage goes beyond just taking risks. It's about having the conscious strength to face a corporate fear and act in despite of them. All right? It means standing up for what you believe in when there are consequences at stake. So Daniel knew that there was a law passed. &gt;&gt; Daniel knew that if he was to ask God or he was to pray, then there was going to be consequences. And he knew what those consequences were. Daniel wasn't brave. He was a man of courage. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's doing the right thing in a sinful hour, in a sinful age. See, ultimately showcasing bravery and courage are both taking bold action. But being being brave happens in a quick hit moment, impulse, while being courageous is a long game plan. &gt;&gt; All right? Where a moment of bravery is usually a response to one's in-moment intuition. Being courageous is processing hurdles that are out on the horizon and intentionally leaping anyway. It's easy to give up and to quit when things are tough, but it takes true courage to continue on in despite of fear, despite of the odds. So courage starts with knowledge, but also requires faith and action. &gt;&gt; Picasso. How many of you familiar with Picasso? Okay. Handful. Picasso once shared this. He said, "What one does is what counts, not what one intentions of doing." All right, young people, listen to me. What one does is what counts, not what one has intentions of doing. There's a famous quote, and we all quote it, and we've probably heard it quoted many times, that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. So I looked that up. I'm like, where did that originate? And it originated way back in the 1100s by a man by the name of St. Bernard of Chevro. And he wrote that hell is full of good wishes and desires. And the phrase emphasizes that good intentions are not enough. Actions and their consequences are what truly matter. So young people, I intended to get up early and read my Bible. I intended to come to church on Wednesday night. I had great intentions, &gt;&gt; but great intentions are not getting the job done. &gt;&gt; I have I have intentions of serving the Lord, but I'm pulled by everything else. Notice the road to hell, and I'm not trying to scare you tonight, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. There's going to be a lot of people in hell, a lot of young people in hell that had good intentions. They didn't want to live their life. They intended at the rightful age or whatever they were going to give their heart to the Lord and you know they were going to do the things necessary but God took them and required them ahead of time. So we can look at it Picasso I love how he said it. What one does is what counts. Young people it's what you do that counts not what you intend to do. So courage is not intending to do, but courage is doing the right thing in the face of opposition. &gt;&gt; And today I'm going to go on notice and say that courage is in short supply. &gt;&gt; Many are afraid to stand out and oppose the masses. We live in a woke generation. Now y'all familiar with woke generation and DIIE and DEI and all that here in Kentucky. We live in a woke generation. People are more focused on DEI and that's diversity, equality, and inclusion than DIIE, dying out to self. &gt;&gt; They're so, oh, I don't want to offend nobody. &gt;&gt; Well, you don't want to offend nobody, but the whole time you're offending God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want to offend nobody. I don't want nobody to offend me. It ain't about us. It's about God. It's about his word. People are more focused on who they offend or if they're going to be offended versus standing on the principles and values of the word. &gt;&gt; People are concerned about who or what they identify with. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, I identify with a dog. I identify with a cat. I identify with pronouns. Him and they and she. And what happened to her and him? &gt;&gt; Now we got they and them. &gt;&gt; I mean, you either one or the other. God made you male and female. He didn't make you both. But in this generation, it's become the norm to where you can't speak against it. Are you going to receive backlash? And what has happened is our society has lost the courage and Christians have lost the courage to stand for the true principles of the word and call it black and white and call sin sin. And now we back down and you know we're afraid to preach it behind the pulpit because now that's going to be what they call um uh hate crime. You can't preach against these things in fear of being arrested. Let me tell you that goes way back when my great great great great granddaddy Paul, he was arrested. He was thrown in prison. Oh, but one night when he began to worship and begin to praise God, notice what happened. The prison cells fell open and Paul walked out of there. Let me tell you, praise today still breaks prison walls. God is still a God of the impossible. He's looking for men of courage. He's looking for women of courage that to stand in the face of opposition &gt;&gt; and stand for the principles of the Bible and not back down, not give up, not give in, but to stand there and be a man and woman of courage. &gt;&gt; And it takes courage to go against the flow. It takes courage to stand for godliness. It takes a godly courage to stand in Satan's Eden &gt;&gt; in our present society. Everything is against a Christian. It's against your morals, against your ethics, against your integrity. They despise us for our standard. &gt;&gt; See, and that standard brings a conviction, a holy conviction upon them. They despise us for our holiness. They despise you for your honesty. They sisters, they despise you for your modesty. They despise you for your long hair. They despise you because you don't wear makeup. You don't look like a &gt;&gt; I know that's blunt, but I'm just telling you, they despise you because you don't look like them. &gt;&gt; You ain't got your skirts all hiked up. &gt;&gt; You ain't got your tops so tight. They despise you for your godliness. It brings a conviction upon them. My wife told me when she was in college, she was telling this girl about how why we must wear long hair. And her response, I wish you would have never told me that. Now I'm going to be accountable for that &gt;&gt; courage. The Bible tells us in 2 Timothy 3 and verse one this know also then the last days perilous time shall come. We're here. &gt;&gt; Men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truth breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good. &gt;&gt; We read this whole list, but I want you to focus on this. Despisers of those that are good. I don't know if you keep up with politics and I'm not asking you to give me a a resume of it, but if you have any kind of insight to news media and you think about some of these media outlets, CNN being one of them, everything is against the conservative. &gt;&gt; We're not even talking a Christian. We're talking it's against the conservative values of our country, much less the Christian values that we possess. And we find they they're despisers of those that are good. And the Bible goes on to say they're traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure, more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but deny the power. So this phrase here, I want to kind of go into it. Young people, despisers of those that are good. It means hostile to virtue, opposed to goodness and good men, not lovers of good men. They hate them. Those who do not love the good must radically be bad themselves. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In our society, in the world that we live in is against you. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't feel that it's against you. Satan is against you. and he comes into the educational system and that's where he begins to propagate his lies and push these things through and to you know because he knows you need an education. And so we find that courage, it takes courage to continue to stand when you're the only one in high school. &gt;&gt; It takes courage to stand when you're the only one on the job. I'm talking about standing for the principles of the word. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not just talking about we're going to get into compromising later, but we're not talking about that. I'm talking about standing when all the boys are doing their thing, telling their jokes and talking about this and what they did. It takes courage to say, "I refuse to be a part of that." And turn and walk away. It takes courage for you young sisters to not trim those dead ends because all the other girls in school are snippy snippy trimming trimming. It takes courage to not put the the the the rouge on and the makeup on and eyelash on and all that to hide little imperfections. It takes courage to say, "God, you made me this way. I'm going to walk forth in this manner and I know you're going to protect me and take care of me and have a godly courage about you to stand in the face of opposition. And we understand young people, we too have been young once. &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you, I've had a pimple or two. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the end of the world for me and it ain't going to be the end of the world for you. But don't compromise your values. have courage to stand there. Let them see that God has a young lady in this hour who refuses to give up on the values of God, who refuses to cut her hair according to the word of God. Young men that refuse their integrity to compromise their ethics just to fit in with some group or to fit in with some click. This ain't about clicking with the world. It's about clicking with God. having a godly courage in this hour to stand for the things of God. &gt;&gt; And God has given you a message to stand with. &gt;&gt; It's a despisers of those that are good. Notice what we find in 1 Corinthians 16 and verse 13 says, "Watch ye stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men. be strong. Now, that's King James. You like, man, you going to have to break that down in some Kentucky language. So, let me just put it in Kentucky vernacular. Is that all right? Can I do that? What's I'll tell you that later. What's veracular? Language. Kentucky language. All right. So what watch otherwise be alert stand fast. Now this phrase here stand fast means to be firm holding and defending the truths of the gospel to stand resolute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not backing up, not giving in, not cowering down, but standing firm &gt;&gt; in your convictions. Standing firm in what you believe. Standing firm on the basis of the Bible. It's standing firm. When nobody will stand with you, you stand anyway. When everybody's walked away from you, you stand anyway. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about being courageous, not a coward. &gt;&gt; That's right. And God is looking for those with courage that'll stand in the evil day, that'll stand in the last day, that know their names are on the lamb's book of life. He's looking for a young person, a young boy, a young girl that says, "I refuse to give up. I refuse to give in. I'm going to stand here in this test. &gt;&gt; Stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men. Otherwise, be a man. &gt;&gt; Be a man. &gt;&gt; We got enough wishywashy panty waist men out there today. He's wanting to find a man, &gt;&gt; not some tightlegged, oh, how many Yeah, I better be stopped. Woo! &gt;&gt; No, he's looking for men. &gt;&gt; Man, that's manly. That's golly. Quit ye. Be a man about it. You know, we'd say in in Louisiana, be a man. Man up. &gt;&gt; I like to add a little bit extra to it. Man up. Weak sauce. When you become a man, I'll give you a man card back. &gt;&gt; Now you a man. Just cuz you drive a big truck don't make you a man. &gt;&gt; It's because you good-look don't make you a man. It's cuz you 200 lb and you may be bowled up, bulletproof, but you ain't a man yet. A real man stands on the virtues and the values of the word. He don't compromise by family. He don't compromise for friendships. He don't compromise by job. He don't make any compromisation. He stands resolute on the promises of God. &gt;&gt; And God is looking for men and women of courage. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When you're rejected, stand fast. When you're despised, stand fast. Some of y'all been despised. But you're standing &gt;&gt; standing alone. Or what they think you're standing alone, but you're not alone. &gt;&gt; You're not alone. &gt;&gt; Huh? You're at home. &gt;&gt; You keep standing. &gt;&gt; Stand on the values of this message. &gt;&gt; Notice when you're facing peer pressure, young people. Now, I know ain't none of y'all have ever faced peer peer pressure, have you? What is that? What's that vernacular word again? Peer pressure. You know, your friends like, "Oh, come on. Everybody's doing it." Y'all ain't never heard that, Daniel. Come on, Daniel. Don't be playing games with me. Peer pressure. Lyric. Peer pressure. You ain't never faced that, have you? Giddy in giddy. Get giddy. Get giddy. Peer pressure. Now, I know you look at us old people and y'all think, man, they don't know what I'm going through. They don't know about this peer pressure. They don't know what I'm going through in school and the pressure. We all have been there. You know what peer pressure is? I know you know what it is. It's pressure from your peers. Lyric. The guys at school want you to do something. I want you to be cool. Fit in. Take a drag. Take a hit. Come on. Everybody's doing it. Come on. Lyric. Don't be such a bad note. Huh? You get that lyric? Bad note. You'll get that tomorrow. Maybe. Don't be such a sour note. There you go. There. We can put that one out there. And then part of you wants to do it. Part of you is tempted &gt;&gt; to do it. &gt;&gt; And young ladies, part of you have been tempted. Oh, come on. It's just a little white head. I mean, ain't nobody going to know it. The way you kick it on there, it will be. But it's peer pressure. I'm being pressured. me. They tell me to do this to my hair and do this and you know if I put this kind of outfit on and it brings a little bit more revealing to my body and my curves and yeah all this kind of stuff and it's peer pressure and if you're not careful and if we're not careful we begin to yield to those pressures. Let me just tell you, it never ends. &gt;&gt; Because we even as grown-ups, we have our own level of peer pressure. &gt;&gt; I work in a hospital. I used to work in a hospital. There 500 employees in the hospital. There's all kind of people in the hospital. And when you make it to the top of the food chain in the hospital, everybody wants to come knocking on your door and they'll press and press all in front of you. I'm telling you young people, you got to know where you stand. &gt;&gt; You got You can't compromise your values. You can't compromise. Let me just say it like this. You can't compromise your marriage vows. &gt;&gt; To peer pressure cuz it's there. &gt;&gt; And the opposite of courage is cowardness. Cowardness. Well, I'm just going to We We break and we give in. I just couldn't do it. I Everybody was laughing at me. They were making fun of me. It never goes away. But stand fast holding and defending the truths of the Bible. When they claim that the days of miracles is passed, that's the time to stand fast. Notice day, not school, not work within the own ranks of the message. &gt;&gt; They claim the days of miracles is over. The prophet's off the scene. So God doesn't do those things anymore. That's the time to stand fast and say, "The prophet may be off the scene, but the Holy Ghost is still here. God is still present. He's still moving. He still does the supernatural. We're going to stand on that word." That's young and old. We don't back down. We don't give up. We don't give in. We stand on the word of God. He's the same yesterday, today, and he'll be the same for you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; We claim the supernatural. We preach the supernatural. When Satan claims that the youth today cannot resist his devices, &gt;&gt; what is one of the main things that Satan propagates to our young people? You got a phone on you? I ain't gonna open it. Don't worry. Whoa. Just kidding. Just kidding. I can't get in it. That right there. &gt;&gt; You know, used to I don't know how long ago. This is a 16. &gt;&gt; Come, bro. It's an iPhone 20. It ain't even out yet. So there now they're we're 16 years into the iPhone or 17 roughly. So let's just go 20 years. 20 years ago you didn't have this in your pocket. So 20 years ago it was very difficult if you wanted to go look for pornography. Oh, you don't mention that word in church. It needs to be mentioned in church. &gt;&gt; It needs to be dealt with in the house of God. It needs to be dealt with in the hearts of men and women. Men and women. Not just men. It's not just a man thing anymore. But 20 years ago, you had a dumb phone, a flip phone, or them big phones, brick phone, stupid looking phone. I mean, you walk around with that thing, you'd be like, now we just slip it in our jacket. You know, nobody knows you got a phone. You get a few minutes, click, click, click www..com. Put it up before anybody knows it. right here. One of the greatest devices against a believer &gt;&gt; because you can have access to any website you want. &gt;&gt; But right here, you also have access to the prophet of God, the message of the hour. You have every Bible in any language, any interpretation you want. It all lays right here. And if God can ever deal with this right here, he can take the desire for pornography out of your heart. And you won't need somebody to be a mandate on your phone. You won't have to worry about the struggle and the temptation of pornography. Why? Because God has removed it from your heart. And if I can get you in that atmosphere this evening where the Holy Spirit can come down and take the desires of the world out of your heart, take the desires of lust out of your heart, take the desires of pornography out of your heart, you won't have to worry about this phone. You won't have to worry about looking at those websites. Why? Because God has removed it from you. &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Joe, what do you mean? I know what I'm talking about. I dealt with an addiction for pornography since I was 8 years old. And then finally, I turned 24 and I was praying, God, I'm about to have a baby. I want the Holy Ghost. I got to have the Holy Ghost. This this things it's got to get out of my heart. It's got to get out of my life. I don't want to be here and be a father to a daughter knowing that I got an addiction. And can I tell you this? I don't have a struggle. I don't struggle with the iPhone. I don't struggle with the iPad. I don't struggle with the MacBook. I don't struggle with Windows. I don't struggle with pornography. Why? Because the Holy Ghost because I recognized what I needed. And I was a man of courage about it. They said, "God, I need a conviction. I need the Holy Ghost in my life. I'm not looking for a prayer service. I'm not looking for my favorite preacher. I need you, God." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God came down and he took those desires out. He filled me with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't have to have restrictions. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you, parents, it's your responsibility. &gt;&gt; Just because I'm preaching this way doesn't mean, oh, willy-nilly, we can do anything we want. You better lock that sucker down like Fort Knox. &gt;&gt; I got a son. When he got a phone, man, Mama Hitler stepped up to the scene. We locked that phone down. You would have thought we worked for the FBI, CIA, KGB, anybody else. That sucker was locked down. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you, if it's in your heart, you're going to find some loophole. &gt;&gt; You're going to find some avenue. Oh, I got to find I got to find it. Then you start conversing with your friends. Peer pressure. You start finding ways. Oh, mama ain't so smart after all. Look at this. I'm being real with you. &gt;&gt; Standing strong with courage in an evil day, a sinful age, till when you're tempted, you don't back down. You know, the thing is to recognize your limitations, recognize your weaknesses. I preached a message to young people a while back on recognizing your Goliath. Maybe someday I'll preach it here. Recognizing your Goliath because your Goliath may be different than mine. &gt;&gt; Let's Gideon, your Goliath may be different than lyrics. He may struggle with things you'll never struggle with. And it be it be your Goliath. He looks at and said, "Man, I can give me a jelly bean. Got them." But for you, it's going to take a supernatural rock. And there be things lyric that you struggle with that get him be like he's supposed to be all manly. Look at him all bowed up and go to the gym and he's struggling with that. Look at him. Look at him like that's right. Look at him Gideon judging me. &gt;&gt; But we all struggle. But notice now, don't yield to the wokeness of this generation that we live in. Don't yield to those things. Don't yield to peer pressure. Stand fast. Stand resolute. Deuteronomy 5:32 says, "You shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God had commanded you. You shall not turn aside to the to the right or to the left. Otherwise, we don't compromise. It's the middle of the road. &gt;&gt; We we look, we don't compromise our preaching. &gt;&gt; We don't compromise because, oh, you see it this way and you see it this way. No, we had a vindicated prophet go before us. I'm going through the middle of the road. &gt;&gt; We don't compromise. &gt;&gt; Psalms 119 and verse three in the NLT translation, which is new little translation. Joyful are those who do not compromise with evil and they walk only in his paths. They do not Listen young people. This is your service. I don't know why I got a couple of you young people over here. Y'all got your hairs all braided up thinking y'all pretty and everything sitting on the back row. We ain't going to get called out. Yeah, you did. Just kidding. It's okay. Stay back here. But joyful are those who do not compromise with evil. All right? And they walk only in his paths. So let me just encourage you young people. When you go to school next week, next month, next whenever, when you go to the job, some of you that are in the workforce making your own living, thank God some of y'all get there. And all the parents said, "Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise God. not paying her own rent and mortgage and insurance and woo, it's great feeling. Well, notice we don't make peace packs with the devil. &gt;&gt; Right now, Hamas is trying to make a peace treaty with Israel and Israel refuses &gt;&gt; because they know the nature of Hamas. &gt;&gt; And we don't make peace deals with Hamas. We don't make peace deals with the enemy. &gt;&gt; We don't we don't negotiate for better outcomes. Well, you know how Satan likes to do it. You can go to TWT next week, but just go don't get nothing. You know, Pharaoh tried that. &gt;&gt; You can go only so far. &gt;&gt; But Moses was a man of courage. You know, it took courage. He had a stick in his hand, a donkey, a upset wife, and a child. And he went down to Egypt. And then what are you doing, Moses? I come to take over. What? &gt;&gt; You mean you and this? Me and this. Because me and this is a minor, a majority with God. &gt;&gt; And notice, he did what he claimed he was going to do because God had already spoken. told Moses, "Go down there and tell Pharaoh, "Let my people go." And Moses wasn't a coward. He didn't back down off the commission. He went down there and did exactly what God commissioned him to do. He commissioned him to exert boldness and courage in the face of opposition, in the face of a nation that was against him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he went down there, him and his old highteer support. Now, I know there's no supports in here. Don't nobody look at me. You brothers better not look at me. Bro, you don't know my wife. Joe, quit looking over there at Hannah. &gt;&gt; You're gonna be in trouble and I'm not going to be here to help you out. But notice, it took courage. He didn't get in a Mercedes. He didn't get in a Yukon or man, somebody's out there driving a Raptor. I don't know if y'all saw that. I ain't going to tell you who it is, but he's over here. &gt;&gt; Like, bro, I want to drive it. I've heard all about that truck for years. I just want to drive it one time. But he didn't go down there in a raptor. A donkey. Y'all know what a donkey is? &gt;&gt; Slowm moving just a meandering animal. He just mosies on along and just goes. But he stays the course. And he went down there and he did what they said could not be done. &gt;&gt; He went down there and did what they said could not be done. He exemplified courage. No doubt they like, "Moses, you're stupid. You done lost your mind." But notice, we don't negotiate for better outcomes. He didn't go down there and negotiate. Pharaoh said, "You can only go so far. You can only take the young people so far. You can only take them here." Look, we're going all the way or we ain't going at all. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, Satan has told some of you, you can only go to church. You can only do this. He don't want you to go to the rapture. He don't want you to go to the body change. Let me tell you, if I'm going to church, I'm going in the rapture. If I'm going to put the effort in, if I'm going to go to the house of God, if I'm going to make sacrifices on Wednesday, Sunday, special meet, you can't. If I'm going to put the effort in, I'm going all the way to a body change. I'm not backing up. I'm not compromising. I'm not negotiating. I'm going forward with courage and boldness and assurity that God said I'm going to be there. We're not surrender. We're not retreating. And we're not backing down. We are standing strong in the face of opposition. &gt;&gt; And sometimes, sometimes even us preachers have to stand by oursel. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have to stand knowing that man didn't call us. The church didn't call us, but God has called us. And we all, if I can just be a little transparent, we all, like you young people, we've had our face or we have faced our opposition, things that shook us, things that try us, things that try to shake us. To about two or three weeks ago, I had a dream. And in this dream, I'm not sure if I shared it with you or not yet. In this dream, this I didn't see the head of it, but this big snake just bumped up against me. I was laying in bed and it just slithered up and bumped me. Big snake, probably like a python. You know what a python does? It doesn't bite you. It squeezes you. If it can wrap around you, it squeeze the life. Every breath you take, it gets a tighter hold. It gets tighter. And it bumped me. I was like, "Wow, what was that?" And a few minutes later, it comes back the opposite direction and bumps me again and keeps going. You say, 'What are you bringing? What does that mean? Because last year I was bumped and this year I was bumped. No matter how many times you're bumped, you got to remain steadfast. &gt;&gt; Satan will test you. He will try you. He will try to discourage you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Even amongst your peers, &gt;&gt; he will bump you to see where you stand. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Notice he was a coward. Wouldn't even show his face. Just bumped me in the dream. Sod up beside me. But only two times. &gt;&gt; So I've already come through it. &gt;&gt; And if we come through it as ministers, you're going to come through it as young people. So, so Donna, bumped by cancer. Some of you bumped by different things, but we don't retreat. Notice what the Bible says about Daniel. Daniel did not run. He didn't run to the next county. He didn't run to the next day. He didn't run away from it. Daniel went home. Somebody help me preach right now. Daniel ran to the house of God, if we can say it like that, and he threw the curtains open, got down on his knees and begin to pray like he's always done. Daniel didn't pray more. Daniel didn't pray less. Daniel didn't compromise. Daniel just did what Daniel's always did. And what am I telling you? You as a young person, keep doing what you've always done. Keep worshiping. Keep praising. Keep giving God glory. And don't back down from the enemy. Be a man of courage. Be a daughter of courage. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed to bow your head in a restaurant and give God thanks for that food. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Let this world see there's Christians in the land. That's &gt;&gt; right, buddy. Be a man of conviction and not one of compromise. &gt;&gt; Now, I've always had, believe it or not, strong convictions. Not too many people ever just got over on old Job. Because I don't mind I don't mind a little confrontation for the right thing. I don't mind standing up when nobody will stand if it's the right thing. &gt;&gt; I don't mind getting a black eye because at least I'm standing for something. You know there's an old country song. This is before hopefully none of y'all know this. But you got to stand for something. Are you going to what, Tommy? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You got to stand for something. &gt;&gt; Why not stand for something that's going to change your body? Why not stand for something that's going to heal your body? Why not stand for something that's going to give you your offspring? Why not stand for something that can keep a happy marriage? Why not stand for something that you can come into the house of God and all the pressures, all the struggles, all the difficulties of their life can just fall aside? Why not stand for this? [Applause] There was a man by the name of Daniel Curry. You probably have heard the prophet preach about Daniel Curry and he used Daniel Curry and Daniel Curry was a great man. He was a missionary and he was on the field and he died and he went to heaven and there Peter was at the gate. I don't know why they got Peter at the gate. He was a fisherman. He wasn't a gate collector but whatever. That's their story. Let them tell it how they want to. But he gets there and Peter's like, "What's your name?" Daniel Curry. I was a missionary. I went here, here, here. And he looked and he says, "I don't see your name." But but but but but but but I don't see your name. But I was a mission. I listen Daniel. I don't know if you know English, Japanese, Chinese, dirty knees. It don't really matter to me. I don't see your name. If he says you got one thing you can do, you can appeal your case. You can appeal your case to him. And so Daniel Curry appealed his case and he goes before brother Thomas. I love how brother Brandham begins to dramatize it. Daniel Curry, have you ever told a lie? What about it, boys? Daniel, what about it? Gersham, Paul, Lyric, girls never told a lie. He says in that presence, he thought, man, I've never told a lie, but in that presence, everything was exposed. Yes. Yes. When I was on earth, I told a lie. Daniel Curry, have you ever stolen anything? He's like, nah, never. Never. But in that presence he realized maybe he have robbed time from the employer. Maybe he have taken this and didn't know that it was truly stealing. And he says, "Daniel Curry, have you ever done this?" And he's in that presence everything was exposed. He knew no matter how much he preached, how much missionary work he did, he knew in that presence, he was not fit. But at that time, here comes the sweetest voice he had ever heard. He said it was sweeter than any mother's voice, brother Thomas. It was the voice of our Lord Jesus. And he said, "Yes, God." He said, "Daniel Curry, he made mistakes when he was down on earth, but when he was down on earth there in Elton, Kentucky, Daniel Curry stood for me. Daniel Curry stood for righteousness. Daniel Curry stood for the message. Daniel Curry stood for the things of God. And now I come. I come to stand with Daniel Curry. For Daniel Curry, he's made mistakes, but I'm standing for him. Put everything that he did on my account." I say, "Oh, glory to God this morning." Lord, thank you today that everything's on your account. And if you'll stand for God in this hour, in this generation, in this age, he will stand for you. [Applause] He will stand for you. When families left you, he'll stand for you. When your friends walked away from you and rejected you because you was a fanatic because you stood for the things of God, he will stand for you in this hour. [Applause] He will stand and having faith. Having faith, stand fast. Don't be a coward with this message. No, stand fast. Let me just kind of go a little bit further. Mercy man alive. Brother Bham faced a lot of criticism for his teachings on the trinity and godhead and healing and the prophetic gift and his claim of being of Elijah. Now leaders of the mainstream Pentecostal denominations such as Simmons of God, they were initially supportive of brother Brandham and his healing ministry. But as he be to turn the corner, as he begin to turn that corner and it was no longer the sign in the hand, it was no longer the the revealing of the secrets in the heart. When it became the preaching of the word, many of his peers, even a prophet had peers and his peers stood against him. Many many of them, notice what it says here, they grew critical of his teachings, diverged from traditional as it diverged from traditional Pentecostal theology. And in the 50s, Pentecostal leaders, they pressed Brother Bam to solely focus on his healing ministry and get away from these unique doctrines of the serpent seed &gt;&gt; of being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Or in the name of the Yeah. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and not in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost titles. Notice his rejection of the Trinity in favor of the witness theology. his anti-denominational rhetoric and his views on women and holiness were particularly contentious. But in the 60s, many Pentecostal churches refused to invite Brother Bradom to the pulpit. And those that did, they were sympathetic with him. They were threatened to be excommunicated from the denomination. Therefore, what it did, it isolated brother Badam. He had to stand alone. He didn't have a church like this brother Thomas that he could go to and preach. There were no message churches at that time. &gt;&gt; But no matter what he faced, no matter notice, he had a message to deliver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had a message to the elect. It was a message of rapture in faith. And he stood bold in the face of criticism. He stood brave in the face of ridicule. He stood courageous in the face of rejection. &gt;&gt; He stood and if he could stand, can't we stand? &gt;&gt; Can't we stand among other message believers? See, we as message believers should not compromise with the message. We don't need to compromise our stand for truth no matter who and where we find ourselves. Don't compromise for the sake of friendships. &gt;&gt; Come on, young person. &gt;&gt; You know, trying to fit into a certain group. If I look a certain way, I can I can be a part of that click. Ah, don't don't compromise your virtues. Don't compromise for the sake of relationships. Well, she's so pretty. Yeah, but she ain't saved. But she's so pretty. But she ain't saved. But she's pretty. She comes to church, but she ain't saved. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham never back. He never changed his tone on the scripture that says, "Do not be unequally yolked." &gt;&gt; From 47 to 65, he never backed off of it. He warned us all the way through, do not be unequally yolked. He said that marriage is one thing you can never find forgiveness for. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; You can never find forgiveness for the wrong one you marry. And sisters, he said, if you go off and marry somebody else after you've been married, you forsake your virtues and you forsake your right to the kingdom of God. you you're giving it away because I'd rather had the pleasures of the world than I would have had the virtues of God. I'm speaking to you about being courageous, standing for the truth in this hour. And it's a simple hour. It's a black hour. It's Satan's eating. But God has determined somebody's going to serve him in this hour. Don't compromise this message, parents. Now, this is to you. Don't compromise this message for the sake of being your child's friend. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I just My mama's the greatest thing since sliced bread when you better put her in a oven and toast her hide letting you get by with all that garbage and Tommy Rock. &gt;&gt; But I want a friend. Mama's a friend. She don't hold me She don't hold me responsible for anything. and you find that we want to be our son's buddy. We want to be our daughter's friend. Ain't nobody Look, last time I checked, I had a responsibility of being a parent. &gt;&gt; And that's our responsibility. You be their Holy Ghost until they get it. &gt;&gt; You don't lay down and you don't give up and you don't compromise your parenthood just to be a friend. That time's coming. &gt;&gt; All right, Lauren. She's 22. Yeah. 22. She's never gave us an ounce of problem. But Jessica has always been a mother &gt;&gt; today. She's still her mother, but she's her friend. &gt;&gt; That time comes, but it don't come when you're 13, 14, 15, 16, trying to figure out life. &gt;&gt; No, you give them the structure. You give them the borders. You give them the boundaries. You give them leadership. Don't pull your hands off. I'm trying to win my son. I'm trying to win my daughter. No, you commit them to God and be a parent. That's your responsibility. &gt;&gt; I know that probably ain't fanf fair and favor, but it's the truth anyway. &gt;&gt; We don't compromise for relationships, for friendships. We stay true to the word. Let me just go on to say this, parents. Another thing, you know, there were it was a few well back when I first came into the message, it was preached said, "You know what? Your kids can listen to any kind of music they want long as they got their headphones on. Let me tell you, in Joe Adams house, I beg to differ. &gt;&gt; I pay the bills, Joe. I pay the mortgage. I pay the light bill, the trash bill, the water bill, and any other stinking bill that comes in that mailbox. And don't you tell me I'm going to let some snickle fris listen to what he wants just because he's my son. Ain't no good going to happen. I'll take them headphones, throw them in the trash, and pull my belt off and whoop your hide. &gt;&gt; I'm not backing up, church. We got a standard to uphold. We got a responsibility as sons of God, as fathers, to hold a standard in that house. &gt;&gt; Hold the standard. Let me just take my house is a no compromise zone. &gt;&gt; You don't like it, you ain't got to come. Well, as long as I'm paying the bills, it's going to be my way or the highway. &gt;&gt; And it also goes for the sisters. You know, we we had it where they could wear their makeup. They could trim their hair cuz when they get older, they're going to grow out of it. Yeah, they did. They grew right out of church. &gt;&gt; Some of you older ones know where I'm talking. You've been around. And you know what? Churches preach this Tommy Rock gospel and now you find some of their people ain't even serving God because we wanted friendships. God ain't called us to be a friend. He called us to be leaders. He called you to have courage and stand for this message and give your children the gospel principles and direction that they need. There will be a time to be their friend. There will be a time you can be their buddy. But now ain't that time. Now's the time to hold the message before them. Let them see we're not compromising off of this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're not compromising. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Refuse to compromise with the word. Refuse to compromise with the message. You don't have to be legalistic, but you need to let them know when you walk through this door. Let me just say this. You can't keep your kids from listening to music if it's in them. They'll find the station somehow someway, but when they walk through that threshold, it won't be there. I'm not going to hold you responsible for the car. I'm not going to hold you responsible for the friends. Not going to hold you responsible for the the, you know, the out there in in the workforce and other places, but I will hold you responsible and accountable for your home. &gt;&gt; You're called to be leaders, &gt;&gt; men of courage. Let me go on. Crit ye like men. Otherwise, be brave. Be manly. Man up weak sauce. &gt;&gt; Y'all know what weak sauce is? It ain't got no strength behind it. Come on. Flip that wrist back, young man, and be a man about you. &gt;&gt; More worried about We got boys today more worried about their hair than girls are. &gt;&gt; I'm like, man, cut. Look at that. Woo! Cut that mess off. I look better without hair anyway. Ain't nobody laugh on that one, did they? That's a good thing, y'all. Smart peoples. But be a man. You know, let's look at this. What makes a man today as we start wrapping this up? When you look at man today in our society, men are judged by their physique. Like Tommy walking around here all bowed up. Tommy and his buddy behind him, man. They both jacked up. The three of us walk in. That is triple trouble cuz we all about 5 foot nothing, bowed up. Your friend ain't going to never come back. Tommy, I'm sorry. But we judge them by their physique. Look at him. He is so cute. Oh, isn't he a heart throb? Look at him. Tall, dark, handsome. Yeah, that's right. Hit him again. Lyric. Tall, dark, handsome. You got Daniel. Pale. Gideon. Pale. Paul. Tall. Paul. Paul. Tall. Dark and handsome. He's a man. See, our society don't know what real men are, what real women are. Men today want to be a woman. &gt;&gt; They paying money to have changes, surgical procedures. &gt;&gt; They don't know what it means. But see, the Bible tells us in 1st Samuel 16:6, "Then it came to pass when they come when they were come that he looked upon Ilab and he said, "Surely the Lord's anointing is before him." Talking about Samuel. Now, Samuel's about to replace a king. &gt;&gt; He's about to anoint a man to be the next king. &gt;&gt; And surely, he's looking, man, Paul, you got kingship ability, bro. &gt;&gt; You got it. Look at you tall. Stand up for me, Paul. Yeah, I like this. tall, dark, and handsome. Handsome. Woo. But you know what? God said, "Nope. Nope. He ain't the one." Guess what? God said, "Go get that little ruddy David. &gt;&gt; Go get that little ruddy David. Go get that little ruddy David. Get that little ruddy David. Oh, he's inconspicuous. He ain't tall. He ain't dark. He ain't handsome. Yeah, you are. But this my story. Oh, but let me tell you why. What made the difference? See, you and I, we look on the physique. We look on the outside appearance. But God doesn't look at that. God looks at the heart. God's looking at where he placed that seed. God's looking for sons of God. God's looking for those that he had in his thinking before from the foundation of the world. You can sit down. Notice God was looking for that one. You were looking for that one. &gt;&gt; God chooses who he will. &gt;&gt; See, God is looking. He looks on the heart looking for that seed. And I love how a prophet would say a son of God, because I'm giving you all hope this evening. A son of God can go a long time. He can go a long time before he ever recognizes he's a son. So don't give up on your loved one. &gt;&gt; I don't care how far they've gone, where they are. The prodical son was there feeding swine, but God still came by his way. If the only time brother Brandham ever preached a prodical message, he said that an angel of God came to that young prodal and tapped him on his side and said, "Boy, you've been here long enough." You don't know when that child, and I say child, he can be a 50-year-old child wavered. &gt;&gt; He could be a husband wavered. He could be a a a mother wavered. A spouse waver. A young girl wavered. A young boy wavered. We don't know. But we must never never give up. Let me keep going. Let me finish this up and wrap this up. Bring this back down to Daniel. Notice when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house. He didn't cry. I don't know why they picking on me. All that drama. Old girl got all kind of drama. I'm going to tell you, girls got more drama. We call them drama queens. drama queens. I mean, you can be the queen of anything, don't be the queen of drama. But he went into his house after the decree was signed. And his windows being opened in his chamber toward Jerusalem, and he knelt down three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a four time. He was well aware of the decree. And he was well aware of the consequences. Yet he had courage. &gt;&gt; He went home. Brother Tommy, kicked the trash out. Boys, we ain't having this. Girls, we ain't having this. &gt;&gt; Clean house. Threw the windows open. We about to have a family altar. We're going to pray this thing all the way through. See, he didn't retire to another country to escape for a time. No, he opened his windows and he displayed a man of courage. He was confronted with the test, a loyalty. He was loyal to the king, but he was more loyal to the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; He was obeying obedient to the king. He was the next in line to the kingdom, if you want to call it that. He was the highest that there was outside of the King Darius. And yet his main obedience was to God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the only thing they found against Daniel was against his God. &gt;&gt; See, the power to obey God and stand for him comes from a settled understanding that God is the one that's really in control. And so Daniel didn't let the decree change his actions one way or the other. He didn't pray anymore. He didn't pray any less. He continued with his excellent prayer life. And the Bible tells us in Ephesians, "Wherefore take on you the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand in an evil day and having done all to stand, stand. Stand ready and prepared. Stand steadfast of mind. Stand and with no hesitation and do not waver, but stand." And this phrase be strong and of good courage happens nine times in the Old Testament. Every time the the the phrase is mentioned, whether it be Moses speaking, whether it be God speaking, he always says, "Be strong." Otherwise, be firm and secure and be courageous. Be firm in your belief and be courageous because the Lord thy God is the one that fights for you. &gt;&gt; It's not you having to fight for yourself. It's not us having to fight for each other. God does the fighting. &gt;&gt; Now, let me bring this down to a closed positions. If you'd make your way back, the Bible tells us in Romans, "For as many are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Aba, Father." The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. And if children and heirs, heirs of God join with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him. And in 2 Timothy 1:7, for God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That word sound there means discipline, self-controlled, sound. And in Philippians 2 and verse 5, let this mind be in you which was also in Christ. He didn't just give you the mind of a church. He didn't just give you the mind of a preacher, but he gave you his mind, the mind of Christ. He said, "Be strong. Be of good courage." How many of you are familiar with Queen Mary or Bloody Mary? If you read any history, American, not American history, good lord, English history, whatever. As I bring this to a close, we find that Queen Mary ascended the throne in England in 1553. And in subsequent years, she had at least 200 people put to death, often by fire, for their religious convictions. She became known to history as Bloody Mary. And Mary's father was King Henry VIII. He has separated the church of England from the Roman Catholic Church, but he had not reformed the church's practices or doctrines. On Henry's death, his young son Edward became king. And many of Edward's adviserss tried to move the church into the direction of a more Bible-based Christianity. And two such men was Nicholas Ridley and Hugh Latimore. And we find history tells us that play something soft if you would that Nicholas Ridley had been a chaplain to King Henry VIII and he was a bishop of London under his son Edward. He often preached and his u he was a preacher beloved of his congregation and who was very his very life portrayed the truths of Christian doctrines in his thought. Hugh Latimer also an influential preacher under Edward's son or King Edward's reign. He was an earnest student of the Bible with the bishop of Westchester. He encouraged the scriptures to be known in English and be read by the people. His sermons emphasize that men should serve the Lord with a true heart and an inward affection, not just with an outward show. But when Mary came when she came to the throne of England, she began to work to bring the English or bring England back to the Roman Catholic Church. And one of her first acts was to arrest Bishop Ridley and Bishop Latimer. To arrest them and after serving time in the Tower of London there in Oxford in 17 September of 1955, they were sent to the Lord's commissioners in Oxford Divinity School to be questioned, to be tried. And when really was asked if he believed that the pope was the heir to the authority of Peter as the foundation of the church, he replied that the church was not built on any man. Let me tell you church, today this church of God is not built on any man. &gt;&gt; I don't care who you put there, he's not built on any man. Paul, Peter, James, John, Matthew, Luther, Wesley, Brandham. He is the church of God is not built on a man. He replied that the church was not built on any man but on the truth that Peter confessed that Christ was a son of God. Really said that he could not honor the pope in Rome since the papacy was seeking its own glory not the glory of God. Neither really nor Latimer could accept the Roman Catholic mass as a sacrifice of Christ. Latimer told the commissioners, "Christ made one oblation and sacrifice for the sins of the world, and that was a perfect sacrifice. Neither neither there to be nor could there be any other proprietary sacrifice." These opinions were deeply offensive to the Roman Catholic theologians. And when Mary came to the throne, she arrested Hugh Latimer and she arrested Bishop Ridley and she sent him to be burned at the stake. Now, they knew the consequences, Brother Tommy of their rebuttal. They knew that they were going to be tried, most likely found guilty, and sent to the stake to be tied and to be burned. And neither Ridley nor Latimer cowered down. Neither Reley or Latimer backed off of their convictions. And we find Latimer's last words at the stake. They're well known. And he speaks. He says, "Be of good church, a good cheer, master. Really play the man. Play the man today. For we shall this day light such a candle in England that I trust by God's grace shall never be put out. That's what God is looking for today. Young people that'll play man. Be a man. Have courage in the face of opposition. Have courage in the face of fear. Have courage is standing to do the right thing. And let me say this. Satan has done all that he can to minimize to destroy the works of God in this hour. He tried it in that day. It didn't work in that day. He wasn't successful in that day. He's tried it in our day. And let me just go on record say he's not successful today. God has already commissioned a word. God has already commissioned a people. And I just want to tell you again like Bishop Mc Rattley here or Ridley here, play the man today. Don't be a coward. Don't be a a backwashed, a little bitty nothing. Be a son of God. Be a man of courage, a woman of courage. Play the man. These men, as I close, were willing to give their lives. They gave up life rather than compromise on the word of God. They gave up life rather than to negotiate relationship for religion because they had a relationship with God. And notice they did that, brother Thomas, [Music] under their messenger. They received the message too, like us. But their message came from a reformer by the name of Martin Luther. And Luther would go and nail the 95 thesis. He was protest the Catholic Church. And I say, if they could do that under justification, if they could do that under their message, with their messenger, what can we do in this hour with our message with our messenger with the token life with the Holy Ghost on the inside? Can't we stand for the truth? Can't we stand for the message? Can we be men of courage and women of courage? If they can do it under theirs, can we do it under ours? I say yes, we can. I say yes, we will. We will be men and women of courage. We will have a backbone. We will not surrender. We will not back down. We will stand [Music] in a sinful age and be men and women of courage. God bless you church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful, wonderful message tonight. Amen. Wasn't that good? Praise the Lord. We love our young people.
