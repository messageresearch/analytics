[24:44] the book of job
[24:59] amen and i want to speak tonight on
[25:01] the definition of manhood
[25:04] definition of manhood we want to talk
[25:06] about
[25:07] uprightness
[25:08] uprightness amen
[25:12] amen in job 1
[25:17] there was a man in the land of us
[25:19] whose name was job and that man was a
[25:22] perfect and upright
[25:24] and one that feared god and has chewed
[25:27] evil
[25:30] and they were born unto him seven sons
[25:32] and seven and three daughters his
[25:34] substance also was seven thousand sheep
[25:36] three thousand camels and five hundred
[25:38] yoke of oxen and five hundred she asks
[25:41] is in a very great household so that
[25:43] this man was the greatest of all the men
[25:46] of the east
[25:47] and his sons went and feasted in their
[25:49] houses everyone on his day and sent and
[25:52] called for their three sisters to eat
[25:54] there and to drink with them and it was
[25:57] so when the days of their feasting were
[25:58] gone about jobs in and sanctified them
[26:01] and rose up early in the morning and
[26:04] offered burnt offerings according to the
[26:06] number
[26:07] of them all for job said
[26:10] it may be that my sons have sinned and
[26:12] cursed god in their hearts thus job did
[26:16] continuously
[26:18] amen let's read verse 8 yet
[26:22] we know what happened there and so forth
[26:24] and the lord said unto satan hast thou
[26:27] considered my servant job that there is
[26:29] none like him in the earth a perfect and
[26:32] an upright man and one that feareth god
[26:34] and is true as evil
[26:36] amen then satan answered the lord that's
[26:39] job fear god for naught may god has
[26:41] blessings to reading you can be seated
[26:43] tonight
[26:44] amen
[26:52] amen so talk about
[26:54] the definition of manhood
[26:57] many people many times brother brennam
[26:59] says that people judge people by the way
[27:01] that they dress
[27:02] or their stature
[27:05] he says man is not judged
[27:07] by how big he is or how strong his
[27:10] muscles are
[27:11] amen
[27:13] man is judged or should i say defined
[27:16] amen
[27:18] he is defined by character another place
[27:21] he says and he says well right here it
[27:23] says and character
[27:25] alone
[27:27] amen
[27:28] character alone
[27:30] is what makes a man
[27:32] a man praise the lord he said i've seen
[27:36] men that weigh 200 pounds and didn't
[27:38] have one hands of ounce of men about him
[27:42] amen
[27:43] man is judged by character what he is in
[27:46] his heart amen
[27:49] even christ was not
[27:51] judged by his physical strength because
[27:54] how many knows he was despised and
[27:55] rejected of man he was calmly he was not
[27:59] he but there was no beauty in him
[28:01] that we would desire him
[28:03] amen so god doesn't look at any man
[28:07] according to his size another place by
[28:08] the ram says you know
[28:10] man you know he judges a man by the bags
[28:14] in his knees where he's been praying
[28:16] amen
[28:17] i mean that's what makes a man
[28:19] amen
[28:21] amen
[28:22] praise the lord i like what the prophet
[28:24] god say he says you know where's our
[28:25] george washington's abraham lincoln's
[28:28] and so forth and we know those were men
[28:30] were men of god who feared god
[28:33] who believed in god
[28:37] and let me just say this and i'll say it
[28:38] again he says you know anybody that ever
[28:40] was worth anything
[28:42] believed in jesus christ
[28:44] you just don't amount to a hill of beans
[28:47] he said if you don't believe in jesus
[28:48] christ
[28:50] amen why because you have no foundation
[28:53] you have no nothing to anchor to
[28:56] everything saul sales just whatever goes
[28:59] we're living in an age when it's really
[29:01] bad now i was listening to a message
[29:04] called
[29:05] he cares do you care
[29:08] and i was amazed at how
[29:10] brother brandon went seemingly in a
[29:12] complete different direction but he got
[29:14] to talking about science and
[29:16] civilization and and education and where
[29:19] it's taken us amen
[29:21] so
[29:23] um
[29:24] let me just start he says now before we
[29:26] have a prayer line listen closely while
[29:28] we run through these scriptures he says
[29:30] we find after that the world had took
[29:32] its intellectual conception of the world
[29:35] the word
[29:36] that was back in the garden of eden we
[29:38] know eve took it on the intellectual
[29:40] side
[29:42] the education side so to speak
[29:44] right
[29:45] though he called us the the reasoning
[29:47] side
[29:48] with education you have reasoning amen i
[29:52] know faith doesn't have any reasoning
[29:54] but
[29:55] eve reasoned with the serpent about the
[29:58] word of god and it got us into the
[30:00] trouble that we are
[30:02] she did it for higher knowledge
[30:05] more knowledge
[30:06] you will be wise you will be like god
[30:09] you'll know good and evil the devil told
[30:11] her you'll be smarter than you are now
[30:15] you know we really don't care too much
[30:17] about being smarter
[30:19] we just care about being closer to god
[30:22] and thinking god thoughts any time you
[30:24] get away from god now i want to say
[30:26] something here but listen so he says and
[30:28] those men became great men renowned men
[30:31] the bible says in genesis 6 4. men are
[30:33] renowned
[30:34] but they went after the sons of god said
[30:37] all the daughters of men that they were
[30:39] fair
[30:40] right
[30:41] i mean they took unto themselves wives
[30:43] and the bible says that they never god
[30:45] never did forgive him for that
[30:47] amen and he brought it down to this
[30:49] generation flashing red line sign of his
[30:51] coming talking about other women and so
[30:54] forth you know pearl o'brien i believe
[30:56] he mentioned how that she was supposed
[30:58] to be the most beautiful woman and now
[31:00] and even in that day to brother bannon
[31:02] he says there's many and many a young
[31:04] lady that'll outshine her by a long shot
[31:07] and now the world is absolutely filled
[31:09] with a whole world full of pretty women
[31:13] very pretty women but ungodly amen not
[31:17] godly at all
[31:19] amen
[31:21] oh my so you have to you have to just
[31:24] in the i didn't read all this let me
[31:26] read this this is got a little humor in
[31:28] it and i like it
[31:29] now notice
[31:31] he says abraham
[31:35] abraham had to do it and call the things
[31:37] which were not as though they were he
[31:40] believed god and it was imputed unto him
[31:41] for righteousness what we need today is
[31:44] to wishbone out and a backbone put into
[31:47] christianity
[31:49] is it it's there the thing that we need
[31:52] is a born-again christians men and women
[31:55] who when they'll see trouble rising
[31:57] don't not slip off not fall off not off
[32:00] run off this way and be partakers of the
[32:02] wrong but a man and woman who will stand
[32:05] and show their colors
[32:07] amen
[32:08] how many believes that
[32:10] even your friends will appreciate you
[32:13] more if you'll do that
[32:16] stand for what's right
[32:18] amen
[32:19] we're living in the hour when you've got
[32:20] to take a stand don't you
[32:23] what man is he brother bam says that
[32:25] don't pre-appreciate a woman let her be
[32:28] as ugly as a fence made out of mud and
[32:31] dab with tadpoles
[32:36] that's what he said not me
[32:40] all right be as ugly as she may be but
[32:42] let her be lady in character
[32:45] enough to stand for the woman morals
[32:48] hello
[32:49] any man that comes along and takes off
[32:51] his hat to her if he's got one ounce of
[32:55] man in her
[32:56] in him i mean
[32:59] let me get that right we don't want no
[33:00] mistakes here
[33:03] isn't that right
[33:04] a real genuine man will acknowledge and
[33:08] respect
[33:09] a real godly woman doesn't matter what
[33:12] her she looks like amen that's not what
[33:14] it's all about
[33:16] amen i'll tell you right now anybody
[33:18] looking for a wife you better look for
[33:20] that character because beauty will fade
[33:23] hitler going you gotta you know you know
[33:25] it's that woman and what she is that's
[33:27] what you got to live with
[33:29] i believe another place brother bam
[33:30] talked about how that he had a girl
[33:32] running off after a little young boy
[33:35] that would come and date her and so
[33:37] forth and come to the church and he
[33:38] wouldn't even come to church he would
[33:40] just sit outside in his car probably
[33:42] listen to boogie wiggy or something and
[33:44] wait for her to get out of church
[33:46] and he asked that girl what do you see
[33:48] in that guy well he's got such sleek
[33:50] back hair or something and he smells so
[33:52] good and and got cute toes or something
[33:54] you know
[33:55] and that's from you know and i believe
[33:57] she got in a whole lot of trouble
[33:59] because of that because of the character
[34:00] he didn't love the lord
[34:02] he didn't serve god
[34:04] he had no foundation
[34:06] and then he says i don't care if the boy
[34:08] looks uh what was it smells like a pole
[34:10] cat in his feet like box guards
[34:13] huh
[34:14] man he's got a little overbite i don't
[34:15] know you know just ugly as sin
[34:17] but if he's got character right that's
[34:20] what you look for character
[34:22] praise the lord
[34:24] oh my
[34:25] so then he goes on he begins to talk
[34:27] about this is a little bit talking about
[34:29] the world that we're living in tonight
[34:32] because we're living in a world where
[34:34] people don't know and can't even define
[34:36] what a woman is
[34:39] it's really getting bad out there folks
[34:42] and man we want to look at why it's
[34:44] getting bad because brother man if you
[34:46] want to listen to it listen to that tape
[34:47] 1964
[34:50] he cares do you care
[34:52] or 63 i believe it is in 707 the month
[34:55] of seven seventh month
[34:56] but he describes it and i'll go into it
[34:58] tonight
[34:59] but it's something how that you know man
[35:02] doesn't you know it's it's pathetic it's
[35:04] absolutely pathetic
[35:06] the world that we're living in this is
[35:08] what this is the this is the words my
[35:10] prophet
[35:11] taught us he says do you know that a
[35:14] certain
[35:15] percent
[35:16] he says almost a third of our high
[35:19] school children over the nation is he
[35:21] has even either been proven to be
[35:23] immoral
[35:24] or had to go home to be mothers
[35:27] and do you know that taking penicillin
[35:29] and different things but now let's go on
[35:31] oh how sin he says oh how sin how subtle
[35:35] it is
[35:37] and how them people their ministers will
[35:39] stand and not preach against them strip
[35:41] jesus on the street and let them sing in
[35:44] the choir and everything like that
[35:48] what brother bran was trying to say is
[35:49] i'm going to show you why that we are
[35:52] where we are
[35:56] okay everything like that and see the
[35:58] very thing that has sent our nation
[36:02] to hell
[36:05] sent our race
[36:08] to hell
[36:09] [Applause]
[36:10] he described it way back there that the
[36:13] preachers and the pulpits and the people
[36:16] have gotten solved and they didn't
[36:18] preach against things and then later in
[36:20] that message he says people are always
[36:22] saying why are you always bawling women
[36:24] out why are you always so hard on this
[36:26] he says the same spirit that tells that
[36:28] person who they are whatever he said
[36:30] that same spirit is calling that thing
[36:32] out and it is telling you where it leads
[36:36] to
[36:36] where that woman smoking a cigarette
[36:39] leads to where cutting the hair leads to
[36:42] ultimately into a complete perversion
[36:46] is that right
[36:47] and that's where he says that's where
[36:49] it's coming from because you got to get
[36:51] right to the root of the problem and
[36:52] that's where the root lays people are
[36:54] not in love with god like they should be
[36:56] they're not where they ought to be
[36:58] and then the things creep in and the
[37:00] preachers don't say anything against it
[37:03] so now the striptease isn't out there in
[37:06] the streets the striptease is walking up
[37:08] and down the aisles here and they're not
[37:10] saying a word about it even then
[37:12] [Music]
[37:13] and that's why the world is in the
[37:15] condition that it's in
[37:18] because
[37:19] pulpits
[37:20] weak pulpits
[37:23] because what what is it this is where
[37:26] the man and the woman get taught
[37:28] this is where they get their teaching
[37:30] is that right this is where it comes
[37:32] from
[37:34] and so this is where it starts
[37:36] amen and he says because of this and the
[37:39] corruption and so forth that's why it
[37:41] has brought our nation and our race
[37:45] and it'll i mean it'll take it right
[37:47] into the great tribulation period where
[37:50] the fire amen that'll consume even the
[37:53] elements shall be
[37:55] that's where it's taking them ma
[37:58] praise the lord
[38:00] another place he says now he cares do
[38:02] you care now we find out kind of sorry
[38:04] here we find out that people won't take
[38:06] god's way
[38:08] first he says but i'm telling you this
[38:10] morning what's the truth and what's
[38:12] facts we're at the end
[38:14] first thing he says before all of that
[38:16] i'm telling you what's the truth and
[38:18] what facts we are at the end
[38:21] [Music]
[38:22] folks how much more is that playing
[38:24] today
[38:25] we're at the end remember many places he
[38:28] says you know uh civilizations at the
[38:30] end the families at the end education at
[38:34] the end
[38:35] who knows they can't barely even have an
[38:37] education
[38:39] they're more concerned about teaching
[38:41] nine-year-olds about sex today than they
[38:43] are about giving them a good math lesson
[38:48] it is terrible isn't it and how many
[38:50] knows whether it's pornography for on
[38:52] the internet and immoral woman walking
[38:54] out there it was immorality that took
[38:57] the world down once it's always
[38:58] immorality that takes the world down
[39:02] corrupts i mean those immorality
[39:04] corrupts
[39:06] and they want to corrupt them at a very
[39:08] young age now
[39:10] that's what they're trying to do corrupt
[39:12] them early
[39:13] and that falls in the line of brother
[39:15] bam says absolutely education is
[39:17] absolutely of the devil
[39:22] well we got to be educated we got to
[39:23] know this but look at what an education
[39:25] goes look at what they're doing with an
[39:27] education
[39:29] amen it's absolutely proven that the
[39:31] prophet was right it is of the devil
[39:34] and it's taking some harm again
[39:38] but tonight i want to look at least a
[39:40] little bit because our influence and the
[39:42] few people that we have still that are
[39:44] trying to be influenced by the right
[39:46] inspiration because what you look at
[39:48] what you read what you listen to what
[39:49] you think and who you admire and who you
[39:52] who you put on a pedestal is what you
[39:54] become like
[39:56] isn't that right so we want to look at
[39:58] job who was a perfect and upright man
[40:01] who feared god
[40:03] and prayed
[40:05] for his children and was in tune with
[40:08] the lord daily
[40:11] continuously
[40:14] huh
[40:16] in order to be upright
[40:18] you got to be perfect
[40:20] now how many knows the human the man you
[40:23] the mankind us kind we're the only ones
[40:26] that really walk upright
[40:30] huh
[40:31] monkeys and chimpanzees they're the
[40:33] closest they may go from one tree to the
[40:35] other rotten but they one time or
[40:37] another they'll take them front feet
[40:39] feet back down again
[40:40] because they're still in the animal
[40:42] kingdom but we're not
[40:43] we walk right and if you run like a
[40:45] monkey i'm really gonna wonder about you
[40:49] why because you was made to walk up
[40:51] right it's not a problem for me to walk
[40:53] upright i'd have a whole lot of problems
[40:55] trying to run like a monkey
[40:57] but they were made that way man was made
[41:00] to be upright
[41:02] and that has a spiritual significant
[41:04] also and that is that everything that
[41:06] you do
[41:08] is to be upright
[41:13] amen he that doeth righteousness the
[41:16] bible says in saint john is righteous
[41:19] amen so how many knows that there's a
[41:22] holiness and then there's a
[41:23] righteousness hello
[41:25] holy and pure before god but you either
[41:27] do everything righteous or you do it
[41:29] unright so let me put it in a simple
[41:30] word it's either not right or it's right
[41:35] there's either unrighteousness or
[41:36] righteousness
[41:38] and man was meant to be righteous before
[41:41] almighty god
[41:44] we were meant to be perfect we were
[41:46] meant to be in the image of god
[41:52] and i wrote down on here i talked about
[41:54] our little imperfections
[41:57] are still little monkey-ness
[42:04] yeah a little monkey-ness
[42:06] in other words not quite upright yet
[42:07] your little mistake is
[42:10] come on get up quit doing that what's
[42:12] wrong
[42:13] but our imperfections
[42:15] says job was perfect
[42:17] and upright
[42:20] he was perfect and right and even jesus
[42:23] says be perfect
[42:26] as your father in heaven is perfect
[42:31] amen
[42:33] uh i hope this goes here and everywhere
[42:35] that as we get closer to christ you're
[42:38] going to hate your imperfections more
[42:40] and more
[42:43] you're gonna oh hate your
[42:49] softness your laziness
[42:52] your ungodliness
[42:53] your unrighteousness
[42:55] more and more
[42:58] all right
[43:00] so he says we find out that people won't
[43:02] take god's way about it
[43:04] and god has a provided way for your
[43:07] comfort god has a provided way forty
[43:09] things
[43:12] how many know that god actually made it
[43:14] a right way for all of humanity
[43:20] that's right
[43:22] but people don't want it people go after
[43:25] other ways
[43:29] amen
[43:30] and every time they do
[43:33] it some other way besides god's way it
[43:37] brings the wrath of god upon them every
[43:39] time that they do it
[43:41] it brings death it brings destruction it
[43:44] brings
[43:46] sin
[43:48] brings everything in when you don't do
[43:50] it god's way
[43:52] amen
[43:53] i like that about job he was perfect it
[43:56] was upright
[43:57] one that feared god
[44:00] and has chewed evil
[44:03] huh
[44:04] he didn't like evil at all tried to get
[44:08] rid of any evil
[44:11] he feared god any man that amounts to
[44:13] anything fears god
[44:16] praise the lord
[44:18] you won't be upright with it
[44:20] you won't be upright without a per daily
[44:23] prayer life
[44:26] i like that song just a closer walk with
[44:28] thee granted jesus daily walking close
[44:32] to thee
[44:37] amen i'm at a place brother's sister
[44:40] said
[44:41] lord i can't even walk without you
[44:43] holding my hand
[44:45] i can't do anything without
[44:47] the lord's hand in it
[44:49] amen
[44:52] praise the lord and i've found that
[44:54] that's the way it's supposed to be
[44:57] but sometimes we
[44:59] think about christ think about god
[45:02] you know a little bit once in a while
[45:04] we'll get into that let me go on
[45:08] so he says
[45:09] all right the next one is and all these
[45:11] things that i have spoken of it brings
[45:14] us to this the world
[45:16] all of these things going after other
[45:19] scientific achievements
[45:22] that going after church achievements
[45:25] going after all these different things
[45:27] has brought us
[45:29] to the end of the world
[45:36] that's the truth i mean it was in 1963
[45:40] the church world took a major turn
[45:43] they turned down the prophet
[45:47] wouldn't have them in their churches
[45:48] pillar of fire no pillar of fire
[45:51] huh
[45:52] because they went to their reasonings
[45:54] their lead to their understanding
[45:57] because i'll tell you this right now
[45:59] imagine if our schools kept bible at
[46:02] school imagine if they would teach
[46:04] these things in our school every day
[46:08] well i'll tell you this right now
[46:10] they should have they should have had at
[46:11] least 45 minutes of bible study
[46:15] where they teach them right
[46:20] i don't know i don't want to
[46:22] get personal here but i hear i'm telling
[46:24] you the stupid
[46:25] stupidity
[46:27] of people to think they can teach them
[46:28] they come from monkeys and all this
[46:30] other stuff and demoralize them and then
[46:32] wonder what we're going to do about it
[46:36] you're not going to do anything about it
[46:37] they're going to shoot you they're going
[46:38] to destroy you because that's what you
[46:40] raised
[46:44] huh
[46:45] you don't raise children right they'll
[46:47] kill the parents
[46:48] amen
[46:51] there's no end there's no telling
[46:54] but anyway all right now notice it has
[46:56] brought us to the end of the world we're
[46:59] at the end he says there's not one hope
[47:02] left
[47:04] we are without hope of survival
[47:13] we are without hope of survival we
[47:16] haven't even got one chance of survival
[47:26] now let me just break this down just a
[47:28] few minutes and just to prove it to you
[47:30] amen
[47:32] let me talk about each one of you look
[47:34] at the medical journal look at where the
[47:36] achievements and readers digest and so
[47:37] forth
[47:38] he says now a minister here that is
[47:40] sending this message around the world
[47:43] to take a statement like that
[47:46] and we're that we're without hope
[47:48] we're beyond redemption
[47:52] have passed a line between redemption
[47:55] and judgment
[47:57] now i must give the congregation some
[47:59] grounds or basis for this statement
[48:02] there must be some reason that a man if
[48:05] he's in his right mind as i think that i
[48:07] am would make a statement like that to
[48:09] tell his nation tell his congregation to
[48:11] tell the people where it'll go around
[48:14] the world for 30 or 40 different nations
[48:16] maybe around the world and peoples and
[48:18] languages that we're at the end
[48:21] it behooves us to give a statement an
[48:24] explanation a little bit to try to get
[48:26] down to the main text of the morning
[48:28] he says now look at what science and
[48:31] education has brought us that's what he
[48:34] dwells on a lot
[48:37] he says it's the very thing that man
[48:38] accept that instead of the word of god
[48:43] a scientific approval science has always
[48:46] have to take back what they say
[48:49] now where is science brought us now you
[48:52] may be shocked
[48:53] uh just for a moment science has brought
[48:56] us
[48:57] sickness
[48:59] death
[49:01] and diseases
[49:08] that's what's it what's on says look at
[49:10] how sick the
[49:12] world is today
[49:14] all the way down to this covet and the
[49:16] variants and everything else
[49:19] we had enough problems before that
[49:20] showed up
[49:22] but look at where it's at now
[49:25] you say science
[49:28] he says now you're you've only been
[49:30] taught one side of the picture but
[49:31] there's two sides of it you say well
[49:34] science has invented this that and the
[49:36] other
[49:38] now he's talking about electricity he's
[49:40] talking about running water and
[49:43] our cars and all of this
[49:46] how many knows even he said even the
[49:48] cars look at
[49:50] all the crosses on the side of the road
[49:53] look at going down to tennessee to
[49:54] nashville or wherever sometimes you'll
[49:56] see you sign up i haven't seen it lately
[49:58] i don't know if it scared people or what
[50:00] but yeah
[50:01] you know the total number for this year
[50:03] so far in february for this year we've
[50:05] only had 260 killed
[50:08] well i don't know about you but two
[50:09] months 260 that's a pretty big number
[50:13] it makes me want to keep my eyes on the
[50:15] road
[50:18] right
[50:19] my wife i'm telling you my grandchildren
[50:21] are starting to drive for me football
[50:23] keep your hands on the wheel
[50:26] watch the road
[50:28] oh yeah i said well i've been driving
[50:30] almost 50 years down
[50:32] yeah and it kind of shows it gets a
[50:34] little careless
[50:36] oh my
[50:38] but anyway
[50:39] you think about how many knows even the
[50:40] achievement of cars has killed a lot of
[50:43] people
[50:44] and so forth
[50:46] all right let me go on
[50:48] sickness and diseases you've been taught
[50:50] one side there's two sides
[50:52] now we're going to grant you that
[50:54] privilege that's right it's done a lot
[50:56] made life for nice and easy
[50:58] and that right
[50:59] made it a lot easier the scientific
[51:02] things that they've done
[51:03] but they've done another side how many
[51:06] knows that is by hybriding food
[51:09] but let's look at the other side he says
[51:12] science is broad sickness science has
[51:13] brought diseases and death look science
[51:16] is hybridizing has brought death to the
[51:18] generation
[51:20] of foods and things it's got the people
[51:22] so soft
[51:24] the men and the women are made up out of
[51:27] a bunch of muck
[51:31] that's what he called it
[51:33] our bodies the strength that we should
[51:35] have
[51:37] the diseases it should shed off
[51:40] the sicknesses should shut off it don't
[51:43] because of the food that you eat
[51:50] he says we're a bunch of muck
[51:53] there's no structure in it it becomes
[51:55] just a bunch of soft jellyfish
[52:00] huh
[52:03] he even pointed it
[52:04] he even brought it into that people
[52:07] oh my if you and i want to say this if
[52:09] you don't have the spiritual other side
[52:11] if you don't have the original food if
[52:13] you don't have every seed shall bring
[52:15] forth of its kind where would you be
[52:18] where would i be if it wasn't for the
[52:20] spiritual food that we eat
[52:22] that keeps us our minds right
[52:26] thank you jesus
[52:28] for keeping my mind right because it
[52:29] affects people's brains
[52:32] because they sure don't know whether
[52:33] they're man or woman or not
[52:38] now let me just say this god is working
[52:40] in making perfect and upright men and
[52:44] women
[52:45] right
[52:46] a real lady
[52:51] a real man
[52:57] the devil is in the business of making
[52:59] them perverts
[53:02] perverts
[53:08] i went to
[53:10] lowe's the other day
[53:11] i had never seen it before but i went to
[53:13] the men's bathroom
[53:15] and i like it you know beautiful there's
[53:17] a there's a men's bathroom there's a
[53:18] lady bathroom but they had another one
[53:21] over there for the first time
[53:23] and it said unisex
[53:26] i'm like unisex
[53:29] i'm sure what that is but
[53:31] i must mean either
[53:35] i said i'm offended
[53:37] yep take it down i'm offended you know
[53:40] they want to include everybody include
[53:42] me and my feelings take it down i'm
[53:44] offended
[53:47] why because you ain't got no mom ranger
[53:49] you're not sure who it is
[53:51] if it was me i'd have made an extra one
[53:54] i just said anybody
[54:04] because i don't mind i don't mind at
[54:06] anybody bathroom
[54:08] now calm down before you say brother
[54:10] bottle get off the pulpit i don't want
[54:12] you no mo
[54:16] but i like for it to be uh you know
[54:19] anybody i was up here at the hardware at
[54:21] the mennonites hardware and they had one
[54:23] men and women
[54:26] that's fine with me as long as i can go
[54:28] in and close the lock the door
[54:31] right that's that oh my
[54:34] i need to go don't i need to go where to
[54:36] make these decisions and say look let's
[54:38] just get a bunch of doors like that and
[54:40] just say men are women huh
[54:43] and you know you go in there and that's
[54:44] that's either one of them there
[54:46] but i'm offended with unisex
[54:49] i don't read anywhere in the bible god
[54:51] created man he created woman but he
[54:53] never created rheumatoid
[55:00] no you won't find it you won't i don't
[55:02] believe you'll find it anywhere in the
[55:03] bible
[55:05] huh
[55:07] because it's not there
[55:09] man makes that
[55:11] and i looked up in the dictionary i had
[55:14] to look up what that unisex really means
[55:15] because
[55:17] you know
[55:18] it didn't say tran sex
[55:20] that would be self-explanatory right
[55:22] that'd be a certain kind
[55:24] they'd probably be better off doing that
[55:26] let's everybody understand that if
[55:28] you've ever had a sex change use that
[55:30] one yeah you got your own bathroom but
[55:33] don't confuse me about going in there or
[55:35] not
[55:39] huh here we go
[55:41] that's right that's where the world's
[55:43] come to they could have simplified it
[55:44] but then i was thinking all the way to
[55:47] church lord help us here
[55:49] i thought you know i got almost inspired
[55:51] i wanted to do some graffitis
[55:53] i wanted to spray some graffitis on that
[55:55] place
[55:58] go in the dark
[55:59] go up there by the side beside the
[56:01] unisex thing there and
[56:02] paint nice devil with little little
[56:04] horns and
[56:06] coming out of his mouth
[56:14] yeah
[56:15] i'm here to tell you the devil's
[56:17] laughing at that one
[56:19] the devil is laughing saying look what i
[56:22] made them do
[56:25] man have i got him confused i have got
[56:28] he is laughing all of you people
[56:31] thinking all these unicorns the devil is
[56:33] laughing at you
[56:36] he is having a field day with you
[56:38] because he hates real man he hates real
[56:40] women
[56:41] but when you don't know which sex you
[56:43] are he's happy when you actually get so
[56:45] far gone until you'll build a bathroom
[56:48] fork
[56:49] you're really gone
[56:52] huh
[56:54] that's right
[56:56] you know the bible says for a woman for
[56:58] a woman our women are to adorn
[57:00] themselves
[57:02] with
[57:03] uh a meek and the quiet spirit and so
[57:05] forth
[57:06] and and dressed they're to be closed
[57:08] into modest apparel i've got to hear it
[57:11] talks about girls and women having
[57:13] modest apparel
[57:17] and because of the hybriding because of
[57:20] the spiritual hybriding
[57:25] the churches that don't
[57:27] i like the way it is
[57:33] huh
[57:35] oh
[57:36] let's not offend anybody
[57:40] i don't care who the word of god offends
[57:42] i hope this does offend you if you're a
[57:44] sinner and wrong
[57:46] if this wouldn't offend you then boy
[57:49] that'd be really bad
[57:52] how many knows that
[57:54] brother branham talked about that god is
[57:56] a sex
[57:57] segregationist
[57:59] god is a separator
[58:01] he isn't just here to make everybody
[58:03] happy
[58:05] you know he's going to separate the
[58:06] sheep from the goats one's going to go
[58:08] to heaven and have a glorious time the
[58:10] other one's going to burn in hell yeah
[58:11] there's going to be some separation
[58:13] going on
[58:17] oh my when you look at it how did the
[58:19] devil listen how the devil is taking his
[58:22] subjects
[58:23] and it's like
[58:24] watching a
[58:26] uh what do you call that where they have
[58:28] a
[58:29] a show
[58:30] and they have a puppet
[58:32] they have strings right take this finger
[58:34] and it is out of the other and this then
[58:36] the other
[58:38] well that's what the devil's doing with
[58:39] this world with these people taking them
[58:41] to hell
[58:42] take them to totally
[58:44] and he's completely just operating them
[58:48] and he's just moving him around wherever
[58:50] they want to
[58:51] then he'll take him up on the board and
[58:53] the devil's having a heyday he's having
[58:56] a great time taking his ink and just
[58:58] painting all over his little dolls
[59:04] he's got them all painted up
[59:10] to where it'll probably get to where if
[59:12] they seen a fully colored person they're
[59:14] saying boy he's weird
[59:17] huh
[59:18] well that's rare
[59:20] because about everybody's doing it
[59:24] amen
[59:26] making people wear immoral clothes
[59:30] going to walmart
[59:32] as i said unto my wife by the way you
[59:34] know
[59:35] [Music]
[59:37] women going out there with their
[59:38] backside hanging out
[59:41] going in there with tights on their
[59:44] tights
[59:45] now this preacher don't have no problem
[59:47] with our sisters and we're tight
[59:50] but just wear your dress too
[59:55] right
[59:56] they forget to wear the dust
[1:00:00] come on folks
[1:00:01] nothing but the puppet the devil's
[1:00:04] prophet is all people are
[1:00:07] god help us i don't know about you but i
[1:00:10] want to be so yielded to god
[1:00:12] that he can use me however he wants to
[1:00:16] wherever he wants to lead me where i
[1:00:18] should go help me to speak the things i
[1:00:20] should say
[1:00:22] live the way i ought to live let me be a
[1:00:25] man god
[1:00:27] how many desire lord i want to be an
[1:00:29] upright man
[1:00:31] i want to be a perfect upright man
[1:00:35] living in the righteousness of god
[1:00:38] full of the joy of the holy ghost
[1:00:41] ready to be
[1:00:42] going in the rapture but to be like
[1:00:44] christ
[1:00:48] let one person paint themselves and lie
[1:00:50] look
[1:00:51] i think rodman he was one of the leaders
[1:00:54] in it
[1:00:55] you know look at where's god let a
[1:00:56] famous person do that and look at
[1:00:58] everybody
[1:01:00] what brother i'm saying he says there's
[1:01:01] nobody ever been a man like jesus christ
[1:01:05] no man like jesus christ he was small
[1:01:08] and statue nothing to look at but man
[1:01:10] was he a man
[1:01:13] he had compassion
[1:01:15] remember being a man isn't just being
[1:01:17] burly and roughing me no a real man has
[1:01:20] kindness and gentleness
[1:01:22] he's got patience and love
[1:01:25] huh
[1:01:27] treats his wife right
[1:01:30] loves his wife as his own body
[1:01:34] and if that lady that woman is a real
[1:01:36] woman or upright woman she is subject to
[1:01:39] her husband
[1:01:41] she is his helpmate
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:47] there's nothing in the world like it
[1:01:49] is that right
[1:01:51] having a helpmate
[1:01:54] amen
[1:01:55] praise the lord
[1:01:58] but to think of how that the devil is
[1:01:59] laughing
[1:02:02] the field that he's having with these
[1:02:04] people
[1:02:06] and robbing them of their joy
[1:02:10] robbing them about any kind of peace
[1:02:12] they might have
[1:02:17] you ought to run the owls that god
[1:02:19] spares you
[1:02:21] he's got mercy upon you he leads you the
[1:02:23] right way
[1:02:24] he leads you in his path i want god's
[1:02:27] way don't you
[1:02:29] any other way folks i'm here to tell you
[1:02:31] any other way is the wrong way that's
[1:02:34] what the churches did they took some
[1:02:36] other way just a little deviation that
[1:02:38] did it
[1:02:42] now they got to have a council meeting
[1:02:43] of whether they're going to accept
[1:02:45] homosexuals as their preachers
[1:02:48] that's pretty far gone folks
[1:02:52] or having homosexuals in their
[1:02:54] congregation
[1:02:56] or lesbians
[1:02:58] can you believe messages churches have
[1:03:00] to address this situation
[1:03:02] not that we do but i want to hear to
[1:03:04] tell you right now
[1:03:05] folks it's going to be all fun
[1:03:07] comfortable if you have anything to do
[1:03:09] with it
[1:03:11] huh
[1:03:13] there's only one thing for any of them
[1:03:14] to do that's to repent
[1:03:16] get right with god
[1:03:18] if you don't want to do that
[1:03:20] you need to just hit the door
[1:03:22] because i don't want you around our
[1:03:23] young folks with a perverted attitude
[1:03:25] and mental attitude
[1:03:27] hello don't want no part of it
[1:03:32] well anyway didn't mean to say that but
[1:03:34] is that all right
[1:03:36] i think so
[1:03:39] people have become a bunch of monk they
[1:03:41] don't people don't stand for anything
[1:03:45] huh

[1:03:48] mind sometimes we we have church on

[1:04:05] sometimes i diagnose myself so you
[1:04:06] forgive me if i'm wrong
[1:04:09] but i thought it was probably from the
[1:04:10] infection a little bit or something yet

[1:10:24] man you're gonna be
[1:10:27] daniel remember three times a day they
[1:10:31] shut him down said don't you pray to any
[1:10:33] other god he kept praying
[1:10:35] he was an upright man
[1:10:38] god honored him
[1:10:40] am i right
[1:10:41] he was close to god he walked with god
[1:10:44] brother branham was a good example not
[1:10:46] as good as jesus but brother bannon was
[1:10:48] a good example he walked so close to god
[1:10:51] walked uprightly tried to do everything
[1:10:54] right
[1:10:57] how many knows that brother branham
[1:10:59] tried to do everything right
[1:11:03] i don't care where i was out in the
[1:11:04] woods or what he was on the road driving
[1:11:06] whatever it was all we wanted to do
[1:11:08] everything right
[1:11:09] so much so that god himself
[1:11:12] of course he spoke to him
[1:11:14] he's earned the thoughts and the
[1:11:15] people's heart declared him this out of
[1:11:16] the others thus saith the lord but
[1:11:18] several different times he says now you
[1:11:20] say something
[1:11:22] you say something you're my son you're
[1:11:24] upright man i trust you
[1:11:27] tell what happens with this storm
[1:11:31] and he says it'll go and it'll shine
[1:11:33] nice for three days
[1:11:35] and just like that
[1:11:37] the clouds part
[1:11:38] had son for three days
[1:11:40] he was so upright so so godly until he
[1:11:43] could say now say what you want to that
[1:11:46] couple that is being totally disorderly
[1:11:48] and so forth
[1:11:50] no
[1:11:51] he didn't kill him
[1:11:53] no he didn't walk him out drive walk
[1:11:56] carry him out like an eye but he says i
[1:11:58] forgive you for that
[1:12:03] you know i wonder what happened to that
[1:12:04] couple i really do
[1:12:07] i know there's one thing i hope that
[1:12:08] they've seen so much of god that they
[1:12:10] got saved
[1:12:12] i should hope that they didn't go out
[1:12:13] there and blaspheme the holy ghost or
[1:12:15] something and say something evil against
[1:12:17] it still
[1:12:18] and you know i don't know which way they
[1:12:20] went
[1:12:21] but i hope
[1:12:22] that they seen so much of god they
[1:12:23] repented give their lives to god
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:28] but i get to thinking folks
[1:12:31] how that sometimes we mistreat the lord
[1:12:33] we just don't care
[1:12:35] for god that we should the whole world
[1:12:37] don't care
[1:12:39] about god
[1:12:40] isn't it sad that any human being
[1:12:42] brother john any human being on the
[1:12:44] earth
[1:12:45] would say well i don't know if there
[1:12:47] really is a god there ain't one of them
[1:12:49] ought to say that
[1:12:51] because all they have to do is look
[1:12:53] around and see creation and look at the
[1:12:54] evidence of the perfect cycle of the
[1:12:56] worlds and so forth and wait holds and
[1:12:58] say there's got to be a god
[1:13:01] they should all humming beliefs they
[1:13:02] should all accept the gospel
[1:13:05] that christ died for every last
[1:13:08] one
[1:13:09] of them
[1:13:12] the only way out is through christ the
[1:13:14] only hope we have is the rapture
[1:13:17] because this world he says is doomed
[1:13:20] because of the course that people took
[1:13:23] on the scientific side
[1:13:27] they're feeding the things that's
[1:13:28] killing us
[1:13:30] bringing all kinds of diseases he goes
[1:13:32] into quite a bit more here but i'm not
[1:13:34] going to go into it but he says the
[1:13:36] structure of the human being has become
[1:13:38] nothing but a bunch of muck
[1:13:40] he was talking about baseball and the
[1:13:41] different things where he can't hardly
[1:13:43] do it anymore
[1:13:45] these in
[1:13:46] these weaknesses and inbreedings of
[1:13:48] foods causes cancer mental troubles all
[1:13:51] kinds of diseases setting in upon the
[1:13:53] human body because of its weakness
[1:13:55] scientific destroying themselves getting
[1:13:57] away from god's plan
[1:13:59] and god said let every seed bring forth
[1:14:01] of its kind
[1:14:03] amen
[1:14:07] how many beliefs we're living in the
[1:14:09] hour
[1:14:10] when it's time for us to be perfect and
[1:14:12] upright
[1:14:15] perfect and upright
[1:14:17] and one
[1:14:19] that feared
[1:14:20] or reverenced
[1:14:22] god
[1:14:25] i wonder both here and out there
[1:14:28] listening
[1:14:28] i wonder if we reverence god enough
[1:14:33] do we reverence him enough do we respect
[1:14:37] him
[1:14:38] enough
[1:14:40] because our actions shows whether we do
[1:14:41] or not
[1:14:43] the things we do show whether we do or
[1:14:45] not
[1:14:46] let our every action speak that we
[1:14:49] respect and fear
[1:14:52] the lord
[1:14:55] and pray for our children
[1:14:58] for one another
[1:15:00] like job did
[1:15:03] continuously
[1:15:05] continuously
[1:15:09] just a closer walk with thee
[1:15:12] amen granted jesus is my plea
[1:15:15] daily walking
[1:15:17] close to thee
[1:15:18] let it be
[1:15:20] dear lord
[1:15:21] let it be how many is with me let me
[1:15:24] walk daily
[1:15:25] right by side
[1:15:27] amen said it might be pleasing to you
[1:15:29] him god bless you let's stand musicians
[1:15:31] if you'll come
[1:15:47] i want to start at least with this song
[1:15:48] that says
[1:15:50] lord i can't even walk without holding
[1:15:52] without you holding my hand
