[23:43] praying for them and encourage them I
[23:45] think they're excited about getting this
[23:47] together and I'm excited to see it how
[23:49] about you amen so we'll dismiss for
[23:52] Sunday school at this time

[25:57] our loved ones our brothers our

[26:02] Lord Jesus
[26:04] [Music]
[26:11] come back if you would
[26:14] Psalm 63
[26:16] we'll read a portion of scripture there
[26:28] good to have Carter Glover with us and
[26:31] as you're turning there just to welcome
[26:33] him he's visiting with Western he's
[26:36] from Hopkinsville so you may have heard
[26:38] of his family the Glovers they used to
[26:40] travel and sing and Carter was playing
[26:42] drums I think when he was five years old
[26:44] traveling all over the country in a in a
[26:46] bus and so he's been around and his
[26:49] family has sung in many many states
[26:52] across the United States there so thank
[26:54] you thankful for Carter to be here with
[26:57] us Psalm 63
[26:59] oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek
[27:02] thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh
[27:06] longest for thee in a dry and thirsty
[27:09] land where no water is
[27:18] because thy loving kindness is better
[27:19] than life my lips shall praise thee
[27:28] my soul shall be satisfied as with
[27:30] Morrow and fatness and my mouth shall
[27:33] praise thee with joyful lips
[27:36] education
[27:41] because thou has been my help therefore
[27:44] in the shadow of thy Wings will I
[27:46] rejoice
[27:53] but those that seek my soul to destroy
[27:55] it shall go up and into the lower parts
[27:58] of the Earth
[28:05] all together
[28:06] but the king shall rejoice in God
[28:08] everyone that sweareth by him shall
[28:11] Glory but the mouth of them that speak
[28:14] lies shall be stopped brother Brian
[28:29] brothers and sisters
[28:31] you know that first verse there's pretty
[28:34] profound for the age that we live in
[28:36] I'll just reread it again oh God Thou
[28:38] Art my God early will I see thirst is
[28:41] for thee my flesh long is for thee in a
[28:43] drawing of thirsty lamb where no water
[28:45] is and outside of the Gospel of Jesus
[28:48] Christ out there in the world it's a dry
[28:50] desert you know there's no life out
[28:53] there
[28:54] I know it looks
[28:56] sometimes it can look like
[28:58] it's wonderful and it's beautiful but
[29:00] it's really not it's just death in the
[29:02] desert out there the only thing that
[29:03] really matters is what you have as a
[29:06] relationship this morning with Jesus
[29:07] Christ if you would turn with me to
[29:12] you know uh to the 16th chapter of the
[29:15] Gospel of Matthew
[29:23] you know it's what
[29:24] first Sunday in December and
[29:28] 2023 is just
[29:31] excuse me 2022 has just gone
[29:34] gone by the 12 months I don't know it
[29:37] must be as the older you get time goes
[29:39] faster or but uh it just seems like it
[29:42] was yesterday it was January 2022.
[29:45] but let me read a few of these
[29:46] scriptures this morning
[29:48] here
[29:51] and uh Jesus there's several things that
[29:54] go on in the 16th chapter you know any
[29:56] of the gospels you know three years
[30:00] three and a half years of Jesus life is
[30:03] condensed in anywhere from 20 to 28
[30:07] chapters in different
[30:08] and different gospels but so there's a
[30:11] lot of stuff that's going on here I'll
[30:12] just start at the first verse and the
[30:15] Pharisees Pharisees also with the
[30:17] Sadducees came tempting him Desiring him
[30:21] that he would show them a sign from
[30:22] heaven
[30:24] you know we all have friends like that
[30:26] we've all had people like that and he
[30:28] goes on the answer and said unto them
[30:30] when it is even you say
[30:33] it will be fair weather for the sky is
[30:35] red and in the morning it will be foul
[30:38] weather for today for the skies red and
[30:41] lowering oh you Hypocrites you can
[30:43] discern the face of the sky
[30:45] but you cannot discern the signs of the
[30:48] times and that we're in the same place
[30:49] this morning you know that the world is
[30:52] just full of intelligent people there's
[30:54] nothing wrong with being intelligent
[30:56] there's nothing wrong with education but
[30:58] if you're using your education and your
[31:00] intelligence to for anything other than
[31:03] the kingdom of God then there's no
[31:04] purpose in it and he goes on to say here
[31:08] a wicked in adulterous generation
[31:10] seeketh after a sign there's no sign be
[31:13] given unto you
[31:15] but the sign of the Prophet Jonas and he
[31:18] left them and departed and when his
[31:20] disciples were
[31:22] they had forgotten to take bread and
[31:24] Jesus said unto them take heed and
[31:26] Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
[31:28] and of the side the season we're no
[31:30] different
[31:31] this morning you and I there's no
[31:34] difference this morning you got to be
[31:35] aware of of what you link yourself to or
[31:38] what you're getting around because you
[31:41] know just a little leaven will make you
[31:43] unprofitable on that day it goes on he
[31:46] reasoned among and they reasoned among
[31:47] themselves saying it is because we have
[31:50] taken no bread so that's just the human
[31:52] aspect of the disciples you know we're
[31:55] no better than they are you know
[31:56] sometimes we get worried about or think
[31:59] about things that God isn't really
[32:01] wanting us to worry about at that time
[32:02] and again they and he goes on to say
[32:05] which one Jesus received he said unto
[32:07] them
[32:08] oh you have little faith why reason you
[32:10] among yourselves because you have
[32:12] brought no bread
[32:14] do you not understand neither remember
[32:16] the Five Loaves of the five thousand and
[32:19] how many baskets you took up so
[32:22] Christ is showing them the Miracles that
[32:25] have just had
[32:27] and they're still worrying about things
[32:29] that they've seen that he's more than
[32:31] able to provide and we're no different
[32:34] in the age that we live in we have
[32:36] numerous examples of what God will do
[32:38] for us as individuals if we just believe
[32:40] them but yet we find ourselves worrying
[32:43] about things we have no control over and
[32:45] he says do you remember understand
[32:46] neither remember the five
[32:48] gloves in the five thousands and how
[32:50] many baskets you took up neither the
[32:53] seven lows or the four thousand on how
[32:55] many baskets you took up how does it you
[32:58] do not understand and I expect it not to
[33:00] you concerning bread but you should be
[33:02] aware of the loving of the Pharisees and
[33:05] the Sadducees then understood how they
[33:08] he begged them not to Beware of the
[33:10] leaven of of the bread but of the
[33:12] doctrine of the Pharisees and the
[33:14] Sadducees and we're no different this
[33:16] morning
[33:17] and I I was reading in this uh
[33:21] book here this morning and it it kind of
[33:25] kind of speaks that it's uh this message
[33:28] here
[33:29] uh day of Cavalry but I'll just read
[33:33] some of these what brother Branham had
[33:35] to say
[33:37] you know Paul said it brother Brandon
[33:39] said as thou follow Christ you follow me
[33:41] the same with brother Thomas or your
[33:44] father or your mother as they follow
[33:45] Christ you follow them and so God gives
[33:48] you the revelation of the truth of the
[33:50] Gospel of the hour then you you have
[33:53] examples that you that you don't you're
[33:56] not going to fall or rise or fall by
[33:59] them but God gives you examples to show
[34:01] you the right way from the wrong way and
[34:03] you just got to know the right way and
[34:04] he goes on
[34:06] I'll read it's the 110th if the church
[34:09] can now
[34:10] um are probably lost my place here let
[34:12] me see no I'm in the right place if the
[34:14] church can ever come to those
[34:16] fundamentals those facts that it's not
[34:18] something you tried to do you work
[34:20] yourself up to do it's something that
[34:22] it's born in you and you all know this
[34:27] morning you can't manufacture
[34:28] Christianity you can't manufacture it
[34:31] it's something that you've got to
[34:33] believe and God's got to change your
[34:34] heart and your life you can't
[34:36] manufacture that and he goes on forgive
[34:38] me my Pentecost for friends that I'm
[34:40] Pentecostal but my Pentecostal friends
[34:43] has got the spot where it has to be a a
[34:46] lot of fast music beating of some bands
[34:49] or clapping emotion they play in the
[34:51] bands before they go to battle they get
[34:54] people in the emotional battle they
[34:56] believe in music and I believe in
[34:58] clapping hands but I also believe in
[35:00] these things that exactly true we ought
[35:02] to have it but yet you have left the
[35:05] great things on done it is the
[35:08] self-sacrifice life that God gives you
[35:11] automatically doing that which is right
[35:13] because it's right and that's what he
[35:16] was saying here Christ is saying you
[35:18] can't manufacture it it's just it comes
[35:21] from the inside out it's who you are
[35:23] this morning
[35:24] and then he goes on to say here but you
[35:26] left the great thing undone it's the
[35:28] self-sacrifice of life that God gives
[35:30] you automatically doing that which is
[35:32] right because it's right just going on
[35:35] don't even think nothing about it just
[35:37] living it then watch and see what's
[35:40] going on you'll just you don't you're on
[35:42] the highway that's what Calvary did to
[35:44] you on the highway opened up in that day
[35:48] uh I'm not that it's amusing but it's
[35:51] really true what he's about to say here
[35:54] it's what the Bible says and your
[35:57] experiences you know you you're either a
[36:00] goat or you're a sheep you're either a
[36:02] pig or you're a horse there's no in
[36:04] between there's no hybrids in it it's
[36:08] just you're either a goat or you're a
[36:10] sheep you're either a horse or a pig
[36:11] that's what you are I'm not making fun
[36:14] of it you either a Christian you're
[36:16] you're a non-believer but there's no in
[36:19] between there's no grayers it's just
[36:21] black and white and he goes on to say
[36:23] here uh you just you don't you're on the
[36:27] highway that's coward did you or the
[36:31] highway opened up that day for you now
[36:33] you remember you cannot be a half goat
[36:35] or a half sheep they don't mix it goes
[36:38] on to say here there's a lot of people
[36:41] who say yes you know but we got an
[36:43] organization in our group we we help the
[36:46] poor we do this that's all right but
[36:49] you're tooting your horn about it
[36:53] you don't do that you know brother
[36:54] brannerman Jesus said you don't let the
[36:56] right hand know what the left hand is
[36:58] doing you do your arms and secrets Jesus
[37:01] said just automatically something to you
[37:03] no more than going getting a drink of
[37:06] water you're thirsty if the next man is
[37:08] thirsty you think about him too the next
[37:11] man's need you think about him same as
[37:14] you would your own need you don't pay no
[37:16] attention you just live it live on
[37:19] and you just you can't be half sheep or
[37:22] half goat and I was gonna jump down here
[37:25] but I was wanting to read something else
[37:28] this morning
[37:30] I really
[37:33] I'm sure you all get that feeling
[37:35] sometimes where God speaks to you and
[37:38] tells you when to say something and when
[37:40] not to say something you know we all are
[37:44] we're all candles we're all lies that
[37:46] God has given us for us
[37:48] salvation experience and God will teach
[37:51] you and show you the path that you need
[37:53] to walk in your daily life and not
[37:55] everyone's path is going to be the same
[37:57] path not everyone's way is going to be
[38:00] the same way but there's one thing
[38:01] that's consistent and everyone has to
[38:04] have it that way is led by Jesus Christ
[38:06] through his experience in him but what
[38:09] you might God might have you be and what
[38:12] he might have maybe are two different
[38:14] things this morning enough this is I'll
[38:16] read this and and sit down
[38:19] and this is a
[38:21] come down to the
[38:25] I'm getting ahead of my
[38:27] myself it comes out of the Epistle of
[38:29] John the first Epistle of John the third
[38:31] chapter of the eighth and Ninth verse
[38:34] and we all know this is the truth uh he
[38:38] that committed sin is of the devil for
[38:40] the devil senteth from the beginning for
[38:42] this purpose the Son of God was
[38:43] manifested so what the gospel is saying
[38:47] here Jesus Christ came to manifest the
[38:49] fact that who one thing he did most of
[38:52] all he showed the people of his day who
[38:54] the devil was and his works and he
[38:57] showed what God was and what God's works
[38:59] are and he goes um and for this purpose
[39:02] the Son of God was manifested he might
[39:04] destroy the works of the devil whosoever
[39:07] is born of God does not commit sin
[39:10] now this is God's word this ain't my
[39:12] word here so this is what the scriptures
[39:14] say about you as a Christian and goes on
[39:17] to say here
[39:19] for his seed remaineth in him and he can
[39:22] not sin because he's born of God
[39:26] these are God's word this isn't my
[39:28] interpretation this is what John said
[39:31] through the gospel and this is what his
[39:34] take is on it and it goes on you this
[39:37] story everyone knows
[39:40] do you ever take your camera and set it
[39:42] on infinite well it just means you're
[39:43] thereafter all right there's no focus in
[39:46] it anymore well that's what God is he's
[39:48] infinite the experience of Jesus Christ
[39:51] is infinite
[39:53] they're they're
[39:55] there's no boxing he's infant there
[39:57] could be no Beetle not a fly not a flea
[40:00] not a mouse not a
[40:03] and some of these things are very
[40:06] uncomfortable but they're here and but
[40:08] this is me this is what he's saying or
[40:10] nothing that ever was on Earth or ever
[40:12] will be but was God noted before the
[40:14] before the world was formed there's no
[40:17] some conception of infinite so basically
[40:20] everything that we see everything that
[40:22] we feel God knows about it and he goes
[40:25] on to say here well then the infinite
[40:27] God who saves you here knowing he's
[40:29] gonna he's gonna lose you next week or
[40:32] next month or next year I say this a lot
[40:34] myself the gospel
[40:37] gospel Hope Christian home is a done
[40:40] deal if God saved you he's not going to
[40:43] lose you There's Hope in that there's
[40:45] trust in that that's Christian hope now
[40:48] the Hope out there in the world that
[40:49] your brother is going to do the right
[40:51] thing or your boss has got that's that's
[40:53] filio typo but God's type of Hope
[40:56] Christian hope it's a settled the score
[40:59] is settle God if God said he's going to
[41:01] save you God's going to save you there's
[41:03] no doubt in it and he goes before the
[41:05] Earth was ever formed there's no
[41:07] conception well the infinite God who
[41:09] saves you here no he's going to lose you
[41:12] next week and next month or next year
[41:13] while he's defeating the very purpose he
[41:16] can't lose you he inherit my words and
[41:19] believeth on me that him that sent me
[41:21] has everlasting life and shall not come
[41:24] into the Judgment but has done passed
[41:27] from Death on to life that's a settled
[41:28] score there that's God's word right
[41:31] there he it goes back to what I was just
[41:34] saying here I won't repeat myself he
[41:36] can't do it he that is born of God does
[41:39] not commit sin and I a lot of our
[41:41] brothers and sisters have problem with
[41:43] this what this is about to say here
[41:46] for the seed of God remains in him he
[41:48] cannot sin how can he sin when there's a
[41:51] sin offering for him and that's all
[41:53] that's everything that we lean on right
[41:56] now that sin offering that God adds for
[41:59] us and how can you sin when there's a
[42:01] sin offering for him how can he be sick
[42:03] when I'm perfectly healthy how can I be
[42:07] blind when I can see you oh my how can I
[42:10] be in the building and out of the
[42:12] building at the same time how can I be
[42:14] drunk and sober at the same same time it
[42:16] goes back to what I was saying earlier
[42:18] you're there's no half gold half sheep
[42:21] you're either a sheep or a goat I'm a
[42:24] building out there same time how can I
[42:27] be drunk or sober at the same time you
[42:29] can't do it and when you're saved and
[42:32] you're under the atonement your sins are
[42:34] not wrecking on to you now
[42:37] this is what
[42:38] God said
[42:40] and he goes on to say here did not Dave
[42:43] say blessed is the man who God will not
[42:45] reckon sin and put sin to it God don't
[42:49] hold sin against this creature that's
[42:51] strong it isn't and this is really true
[42:54] right here this will divide whole
[42:57] families believing a simple truth like
[42:59] this it isn't skim milk but that's the
[43:02] Bible God will not reconcine to the
[43:04] righteous God by his grace through
[43:07] predestination there's whole churches
[43:09] out there when you mention
[43:11] predestination and we'll just their
[43:13] minds will go they'll lose it not
[43:15] willing that any should perish but all
[43:17] might come to repentance but the
[43:20] infinity knowing who would come and who
[43:22] would not come he could predestinate
[43:25] everything to the work to his will
[43:27] if he didn't do it why would he permit
[43:30] sin in the first place has there ever
[43:32] been a sinner that would never have been
[43:34] a savior attributes within him could not
[43:36] be pulled out and I'll just finish with
[43:38] this simple thought or
[43:40] you know it's a comforting thought if we
[43:42] come to the end of the year I know I say
[43:44] this a lot I don't mean to say but it's
[43:47] the truth
[43:48] and if God ever saved you he's put a
[43:51] spirit in you and his life in your heart
[43:53] then you have a hope and that hope is an
[43:55] eternal hope that God wouldn't have
[43:57] started that journey in you if he wasn't
[44:00] going to finish with you this morning
[44:02] brother David

[1:18:46] the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen
[1:18:50] didn't want to do something just before
[1:18:52] I am going to the word of God wanted to
[1:18:54] give a report on uh on where we're at
[1:18:58] financially you know Brian usually does
[1:19:00] it but I thought with this occasion
[1:19:02] maybe I just say something
[1:19:04] amen and me and brother Brian both
[1:19:06] signed that paper last Monday I believe
[1:19:09] it was having sold six point something
[1:19:11] Acres of that field and then so it's not
[1:19:14] ours anymore amen you know sometimes I
[1:19:17] sell a vehicle and actually not so long
[1:19:19] ago but sometimes you sell stuff and
[1:19:21] you're like oh man I wish I wouldn't
[1:19:22] have sold that you know
[1:19:24] but in this case I'm glad we did I mean
[1:19:27] I feel good about it amen feels good
[1:19:29] amen and so uh we was at I guess around
[1:19:33] 69 000 earlier this year I believe it
[1:19:37] was that we owed on this place yet you
[1:19:39] know and it's been quite a few years
[1:19:42] coming amen and so I think I made a big
[1:19:45] mistake uh us and the board maybe not a
[1:19:48] little mistake anyway and partially my
[1:19:49] fault but holding brother Brian back on
[1:19:52] paying the extra over the years but amen
[1:19:55] that wasn't smart how many knows it's
[1:19:57] always good to pay extra amen but in the
[1:19:59] last year so we've we've kind of opened
[1:20:01] that up and it's helped us so we went
[1:20:03] from uh 59 000 amen I mean not 59 but 69
[1:20:07] and so now we owe the paper says and
[1:20:10] brother Brian hasn't made that December
[1:20:12] payment yet I guess after that it'll be
[1:20:14] around 19 000 somewhere in uh plus
[1:20:17] change but right now it's 20 600 or
[1:20:19] something I believe it is so that's a
[1:20:21] fifty thousand dollars I mean that we've
[1:20:23] gotten taking care of this year let's
[1:20:25] give the Lord a hand see thank you Lord
[1:20:27] Jesus praise the Lord
[1:20:30] amen
[1:20:32] and I got faith before next Christmas
[1:20:34] comes up that we'll be done with it amen
[1:20:37] I'm going to believe with me before next
[1:20:39] Christmas comes up we'll have a special
[1:20:41] services celebration service worship
[1:20:43] service praise God services and we'll
[1:20:45] get some uh some preacher in here and
[1:20:48] then we'll have some good Services amen
[1:20:50] amen to celebrate so God is good amen I
[1:20:53] certainly
[1:20:54] uh I guess the years passed so fast you
[1:20:57] know I never thought it would be you
[1:21:00] know I thought I might be 65 70 before
[1:21:02] we get it paid but I'm glad that it's
[1:21:04] going to be a lot earlier than that amen
[1:21:06] so praise the Lord God is good amen we
[1:21:09] love you all
[1:21:10] God is good amen and we're just looking
[1:21:12] for a good day in the Lord amen and so
[1:21:15] this is something we've heard before but
[1:21:18] you know I had to think about this when
[1:21:20] I thought thought about preaching things
[1:21:21] I've preached before and the thing about
[1:21:23] the word of God is it doesn't matter how
[1:21:25] many times you preach it it's still just
[1:21:28] as good as it ever was it's as true and
[1:21:31] it's it's up to date it's uh God stands
[1:21:34] behind his word and so never heard here
[1:21:37] hurts us to hear it again does it amen
[1:21:40] and so you just never know what God
[1:21:42] might do but I certainly uh
[1:21:45] I'm thankful to be a preacher amen
[1:21:48] amen I tell you what I don't believe
[1:21:50] that uh there's a greater calling amen
[1:21:53] it's certainly a whole lot better than
[1:21:55] being the president of the United States
[1:21:57] or uh the Prime Minister of England or
[1:22:00] some prime minister or or of some
[1:22:03] country or something because amen this
[1:22:05] is so so much greater I mean it's
[1:22:08] Eternal it's it it oh mine and you know
[1:22:11] the other day I was just looking up and
[1:22:13] for some reason sometimes in the fall
[1:22:15] you know those cow the clouds will all
[1:22:18] look like milky and just kind of flowing
[1:22:20] and up and down and Ripley almost looks
[1:22:22] like the ocean's up there right and I
[1:22:24] thought mine I looked at all of it and I
[1:22:26] said you know the Bible says you know I
[1:22:29] has not seen in neither has ear heard
[1:22:31] and can we even conceive what the the
[1:22:35] greatness of what heaven's going to be
[1:22:37] like
[1:22:39] amen it's going to be beautiful amen
[1:22:42] amen and I believe the power of God says
[1:22:45] there's no words to describe how
[1:22:46] beautiful it is over there and there's
[1:22:48] no words to describe how horrible hell
[1:22:50] is
[1:22:51] so how many's got an objective this
[1:22:53] morning that is I want to make Heaven I
[1:22:56] don't want to make hell I want to make
[1:22:57] Heaven amen and that's what we come to
[1:22:59] church for is to get our souls ready
[1:23:01] amen because uh you know Naturally
[1:23:05] Speaking we're all dead
[1:23:07] we're all dead it's just a matter of
[1:23:09] time you know right just a matter of
[1:23:12] time man we all have to go by the way of
[1:23:14] the grave but I'm so glad aren't you
[1:23:16] that that's not all there is
[1:23:19] [Laughter]
[1:23:21] Glory don't get me going there's so much
[1:23:24] more folks
[1:23:26] and the real Riches of this world is not
[1:23:29] the Natural Things the real riches is
[1:23:32] what Christ did on Calvary
[1:23:35] when he opened up his side you know and
[1:23:38] and the blood and the water came out
[1:23:40] true riches came out because he was pain
[1:23:43] amen for our way back to fellowship with
[1:23:45] almighty God Amen so praise be to God
[1:23:48] this morning amen let's not hold you up
[1:23:51] let's keep you standing too long we'll
[1:23:53] let you take it easy while I work
[1:23:56] ah
[1:23:57] turn your bibles if you will with me to
[1:24:00] Romans Romans we want to talk a little
[1:24:02] bit with the help of the Lord and we're
[1:24:04] going to be focusing little towards the
[1:24:06] black dog and the white dog is that okay
[1:24:08] Wednesday night we talked about how that
[1:24:10] you know uh God is the enable he makes
[1:24:14] it uh makes us makes it possible amen he
[1:24:19] enables us
[1:24:20] Amen to
[1:24:21] do whatever we need done even to move
[1:24:24] mountains and cast them in to the Sea
[1:24:26] amen he enabled Joshua to stop the Sun
[1:24:29] and the Moon and all of that amen so he
[1:24:32] could get the job done amen I don't know
[1:24:35] about you but I really don't like
[1:24:37] inability
[1:24:40] huh you can't do it no it can't be done
[1:24:43] I like when you tell me I can be done
[1:24:46] amen
[1:24:47] praise God
[1:24:48] and this morning we want to look at that
[1:24:50] and this is going to be a little bit
[1:24:51] more towards how that we can do it amen
[1:24:55] praise the Lord Romans 8 and 1 chapter I
[1:24:58] want a verse I want to read amen and I
[1:25:01] actually have a lot of reading I'd like
[1:25:03] to do but I don't know just how much I'm
[1:25:04] how much I'll do because Paul really
[1:25:07] really defines and really goes into
[1:25:10] detail and speaking of what we want to
[1:25:11] talk about in chapter 8 of Romans and
[1:25:14] we'll read verse
[1:25:17] 2.
[1:25:20] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:25:23] Christ Jesus have made me free from the
[1:25:25] law of sin and death
[1:25:29] amen
[1:25:31] for what the law could not do in that it
[1:25:34] was weak through the flesh God sending
[1:25:36] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[1:25:38] flesh
[1:25:39] and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[1:25:43] may God add His blessings to the reading
[1:25:45] of the word you can be seated
[1:25:48] amen praise the Lord amen I want to talk
[1:25:51] about laws for a little bit now brother
[1:25:53] Bannon and every present water from The
[1:25:56] Rock Says at this rate now these things
[1:25:58] are controlled by laws
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:03] by loss all of God's system is put up by
[1:26:09] laws
[1:26:10] amen
[1:26:12] now I was just back there studying and
[1:26:14] thinking you know uh you know because a
[1:26:16] lot of times we don't think the Bible
[1:26:18] and Grace
[1:26:20] uh and mercy as being a law
[1:26:24] we don't think of it that way so this is
[1:26:27] kind of a different way to look at it
[1:26:28] amen
[1:26:30] but yet even grace and mercy there's a
[1:26:33] lot to it
[1:26:36] isn't that right because we're because
[1:26:38] because one day God is going to judge
[1:26:41] the world isn't that right and he's
[1:26:42] going to judge it what does God what
[1:26:45] does a judge use to judge anybody with
[1:26:48] he uses the law
[1:26:50] he broke the law the law said this and
[1:26:54] you broke that law now you have to be
[1:26:56] judged so if there's a judgment day and
[1:26:58] God's going to be the judge and he's
[1:27:00] going to judge the World by Jesus Christ
[1:27:02] or by the Bible by the word and this
[1:27:05] whole thing is a law
[1:27:09] huh
[1:27:10] kind of new for you isn't it the whole
[1:27:12] thing's the law can I start with Mark 16
[1:27:15] going into all the world and preach the
[1:27:18] gospel that every creature he that
[1:27:21] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:27:25] and he that believeth not shall be
[1:27:28] damned
[1:27:30] that's his law
[1:27:32] and on that day I mean even John 3 16
[1:27:35] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:27:38] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:27:40] believeth in him shall not be damned or
[1:27:44] condemned at the judgment
[1:27:47] amen but he that believeth not shall be
[1:27:50] damned amen
[1:27:52] shall be condemned so there's mercy and
[1:27:55] there's Grace there's Judgment of Grace
[1:27:56] there's eternal life for damnation right
[1:27:59] there and he'll say look did I send my
[1:28:02] son into the world so you wouldn't have
[1:28:04] to be to him
[1:28:05] but you have to believe and you refuse
[1:28:08] to believe therefore you get the last
[1:28:11] part of it
[1:28:15] so everything's controlled by the law
[1:28:17] even better than I'm talking about a
[1:28:19] couple quotes So if you want healing you
[1:28:21] have to work according to God's love
[1:28:24] no matter what you want
[1:28:26] we're all familiar with what brother
[1:28:28] random said about uh Michigan so forth
[1:28:31] but let me just bring a couple of these
[1:28:32] in here okay so I like that he says all
[1:28:35] of God's system is put here by laws
[1:28:37] no he says let's stop here for a minute
[1:28:40] let's take the world as it turns every
[1:28:42] 24 hours it makes a complete Revolution
[1:28:45] and he goes to talking about it to make
[1:28:48] a timepiece and to make a watch and that
[1:28:50] watch amen it may be ever so good but
[1:28:52] eventually it'll lose a second or two
[1:28:55] and after a while maybe a minute or two
[1:28:57] or it's so imperfect that it might begin
[1:29:00] to gain too many seconds ahead is that
[1:29:02] right it'll never be perfect
[1:29:06] but he does you talk about the Sun and
[1:29:08] the Moon and he talks about the galaxies
[1:29:10] the moon and the Haley's Comet and
[1:29:12] everything that comes around he says the
[1:29:13] tides coming in and out they know
[1:29:15] exactly when the moon's going up when
[1:29:16] the moon's going down when the Tide's
[1:29:18] coming in when the child's going out and
[1:29:19] they can give you a schedule over now
[1:29:21] because it's right on time
[1:29:24] guys
[1:29:25] whoa let me tell you something if you
[1:29:27] ever get caught up in the line
[1:29:30] of God and notice here what I just read
[1:29:33] did I say what the spirit is for free
[1:29:34] this is that even the spirit has a law
[1:29:39] to it
[1:29:40] for the law of the spirit has made me
[1:29:43] free from the law of sin and death
[1:29:45] [Music]
[1:29:48] that's right so it all has laws
[1:29:53] amen
[1:29:56] amen the moon going out amen it controls
[1:29:59] the tides and if that ever got messed up
[1:30:01] and the whole thing would come and so
[1:30:03] forth it never misses a tick hallelujah
[1:30:05] it's just perfect because it's running
[1:30:07] according to the law of God
[1:30:11] amen how many knows whenever God said
[1:30:13] let there be let there be let there be
[1:30:15] that was God creating a law let the moon
[1:30:18] be in this place let there be light and
[1:30:19] let it do its job
[1:30:22] oh my if we can ever get that way and
[1:30:25] get our lives and that's how many's with
[1:30:28] me
[1:30:28] do you know where no one you know what
[1:30:30] I'm saying if our lives would be so
[1:30:32] channeled into God's laws until he would
[1:30:34] just do whatever that holy spirit says
[1:30:37] whatever God says that's it just kicks
[1:30:39] perfectly
[1:30:42] I believe in the prophet of God comes to
[1:30:44] mind he says you know he'll pray but if
[1:30:45] God says you know quit this service and
[1:30:47] go over there he'll kill he'll tell the
[1:30:49] preach he'll says look I'm gone and I'm
[1:30:52] going over there because he just
[1:30:53] followed the Holy Spirit
[1:30:55] that's what you and I got to be
[1:30:58] amen
[1:31:00] oh my
[1:31:03] so many different things here
[1:31:05] oh my praise be to God
[1:31:10] now notice then he said he was standing
[1:31:12] there by Lake Michigan he was talking
[1:31:14] about the law of gravitation and he's
[1:31:16] seen all these Great Lakes all over the
[1:31:18] great lakes and he goes to describe in
[1:31:20] Arizona and the vast huge deserts just
[1:31:23] out there and he says you know you know
[1:31:25] if they would ever work according if
[1:31:27] they're ever going to water that they'd
[1:31:29] have to work according to the law of
[1:31:30] gravitation
[1:31:32] he said you could scream you can shout
[1:31:34] you can holler you can do whatever you
[1:31:36] want to but it's never going to get it
[1:31:38] there you gotta work according to the
[1:31:40] law of gravitation
[1:31:41] I mean there's a law of gravitation is a
[1:31:44] powerful thing
[1:31:47] you know they didn't just build things
[1:31:49] like the dams the Hoover dams allow
[1:31:51] water to just the flowing of water
[1:31:55] hello just the flowing of water
[1:31:58] to cause turbines and so forth to turn
[1:32:01] until the Hoover Dam I was meeting back
[1:32:04] there he talks about any supplies you
[1:32:06] know I don't know how old it is but it
[1:32:07] supplies the electricity for No Doubt
[1:32:09] factories and plants and everything else
[1:32:11] and for eight million people
[1:32:14] huh
[1:32:18] think about it talk about clean energy
[1:32:20] right
[1:32:22] amenities got powerful let me tell you
[1:32:24] something how many knows that the water
[1:32:25] of the word there's nothing to be
[1:32:27] emphasized greater than the washing of
[1:32:29] the Water by the way
[1:32:31] nothing like the word flowing through a
[1:32:34] church to keep it clean and to give it
[1:32:36] power
[1:32:42] oh my
[1:32:44] unlimited power
[1:32:46] how many knows every one of us is
[1:32:48] accessible to unlimited power
[1:32:51] even better man he's talking about power
[1:32:53] he says now the Holy Spirit here
[1:32:55] how many knows there's a law to this
[1:32:57] fourth dimension there's a law to radio
[1:32:59] waves and television waves and all of
[1:33:02] that so forth and I certainly don't know
[1:33:04] all the all the things there is to know
[1:33:06] about it
[1:33:09] I'm not sure if I may be rude yeah I've
[1:33:11] got one word perhaps that I could use as
[1:33:13] big and make me sound like I know
[1:33:15] something about it be a transmitter
[1:33:17] right
[1:33:18] and a different thing that are
[1:33:20] transmitted into different things that
[1:33:21] it's made out of so much copper and so
[1:33:24] forth everything has to be either just
[1:33:25] like the antenna you know what it's made
[1:33:27] out of and a certain kind of material I
[1:33:29] mean it's just all going to be a certain
[1:33:31] kind of material
[1:33:34] and the thing
[1:33:35] God where man came from
[1:33:39] huh where we come from that gas this is
[1:33:42] according to me which is not very
[1:33:43] reliable but I guess one of the first
[1:33:45] electronic things that we ever
[1:33:47] discovered was probably the telegraph
[1:33:50] huh
[1:33:52] I don't know about two but I'm thankful
[1:33:54] I can hear your voice you don't have to
[1:33:55] go tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap
[1:33:58] tap tap
[1:34:00] no that so many times means yes and
[1:34:02] someone accept me Noah and all that but
[1:34:04] Telegraph boy I'm excited to do how
[1:34:06] great he was and can't get the telegraph
[1:34:09] remember how great he was just to be
[1:34:12] believed that the just shall live by
[1:34:14] faith it's just a defeat place
[1:34:18] how much greater it was perhaps whenever
[1:34:20] the penny comes was coming along amen
[1:34:22] that the gift of speaking in tongues he
[1:34:24] had a greater portion of almighty God
[1:34:27] how many knows did you and I
[1:34:29] message Believers we're supposed to have
[1:34:31] a whole lot more than what the
[1:34:32] Pentecostals had
[1:34:34] we're supposed to be further down the
[1:34:36] road than what they were
[1:34:38] amen

[1:34:42] Lord help us just open up
[1:34:44] I mean believe you just gotta have to
[1:34:45] we're going to have to just open up more
[1:34:54] amen
[1:34:55] let me just say this while it comes to
[1:34:57] mind if you're not where you are with
[1:35:00] God
[1:35:03] can I tell you what you do
[1:35:06] then you are going to have to do
[1:35:08] something different
[1:35:15] if you're not the kind of Christian you
[1:35:17] have to do something different
[1:35:23] I used to get up in the morning and I
[1:35:25] have my cup of coffee you know and I do
[1:35:26] this that and the other like to have my
[1:35:28] prayer before I go do things and so
[1:35:29] forth but this morning I got up you know
[1:35:31] what I'm saying and then I said listen
[1:35:33] I'm going to turn on Pandora
[1:35:35] put my old good old gospel music on
[1:35:38] there and and irritated my wife just a
[1:35:40] little bit because she don't like all of
[1:35:41] my music
[1:35:44] especially that everybody I met a
[1:35:49] superhero

[1:35:55] anyway
[1:35:58] but you know that just speaking that
[1:36:00] says you know I just want my atmosphere

[1:36:03] prophet of God says you know the birds
[1:36:05] when they get up in the morning when he
[1:36:06] said they begin to sing at the top of
[1:36:08] their voice
[1:36:09] and I thought you know if you got up and
[1:36:11] we got up every morning maybe that's
[1:36:13] where you need to stop where I need to
[1:36:14] start amen give God some Glory give him
[1:36:17] some praise
[1:36:18] get out there in the living room I
[1:36:20] thought maybe I need to get up here and

[1:36:24] you know I'd have a lot less problem I
[1:36:26] feel a lot better today
[1:36:28] but if you're gonna get up every morning
[1:36:30] and you're going to be grumpy that's
[1:36:31] what your whole day's gonna be your gun

[1:48:54] the law of the seed let it bring forth
[1:48:58] if it's kind Hallelujah
[1:49:01] there's another law
[1:49:03] that says you know that that hand that
[1:49:05] chicken can sit on those eggs and sit on
[1:49:07] them eggs and sit on them eggs

[1:49:38] isn't that right
[1:49:40] amen and with that German life ain't
[1:49:42] there it's just dead and rotten

[1:49:55] you can tell them all about God and His
[1:49:58] grace and his mercy and you can't get a
[1:50:01] squeak out of some folks
[1:50:03] huh
[1:50:04] just sit there dead
[1:50:08] what happens when that happens what do
[1:50:10] you do with all them eggs try again
[1:50:13] no but a man says well sometimes we have
[1:50:16] to clean out the nest
[1:50:18] let's get somebody that's been with the
[1:50:20] mail let me tell you something
[1:50:22] all these Hypocrites around
[1:50:24] people that have a profession but
[1:50:27] a confession
[1:50:29] but not a possession
[1:50:31] huh
[1:50:33] get rid of it
[1:50:35] you need something down on here folks
[1:50:37] that's the greatest thing you can have
[1:50:38] is something down in here
[1:50:44] praise the Lord
[1:50:51] let's talk about
[1:50:52] two things now we're gonna fix the go
[1:50:54] into
[1:50:55] the law of the of the Supreme
[1:50:59] buddy
[1:51:02] not right
[1:51:07] but first we want to talk about the law
[1:51:10] of sin
[1:51:12] the law of your flesh
[1:51:14] Paul describes it if you want to go with
[1:51:16] me
[1:51:17] in Romans
[1:51:24] and of course brother Bannon preached a
[1:51:27] message on
[1:51:28] what was it
[1:51:29] invisible Union of Christ in the bride
[1:51:31] out of Romans 7 1 through round four
[1:51:33] talking about how that a woman is bound
[1:51:35] to the law of her husband as long as he
[1:51:37] liveth but if that husband be dead she
[1:51:39] is freed from that law associate she can
[1:51:41] be married to another but if I'm goes to
[1:51:43] say it he says you know that there ain't
[1:51:44] no bride of Jesus Christ can be married
[1:51:46] to a man-made denomination to be the
[1:51:48] bride of Christ at the same time she has
[1:51:50] to be dick that the husband has to be
[1:51:52] dead to her is that right but we're
[1:51:54] going to pick it up a little bit further
[1:51:56] down if that'd be all right
[1:51:57] uh verse four wherefore my brethren you
[1:52:00] also are become dead to the law by the
[1:52:02] body of Christ
[1:52:03] that you should not be married that you
[1:52:05] should be married to another even to him
[1:52:07] who is raised from the dead and that we
[1:52:09] should bring forth fruit unto God
[1:52:11] for when we were in the flesh the
[1:52:14] Motions of sin which all were by the law
[1:52:16] did work in our members to bring forth
[1:52:19] fruit unto death
[1:52:20] but now we are delivered from the law
[1:52:24] amen that being dead wherein ye were
[1:52:27] held we should serve in newness of
[1:52:30] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[1:52:32] letter what shall we say is the law sin
[1:52:34] God forbid no if I had not known sin but
[1:52:38] I had not known sin but by the law for I
[1:52:41] had not known lust except the Lord said
[1:52:44] Thou shalt not covet but sin taking an
[1:52:46] occasion by the Commandment wrought in
[1:52:48] me all manner of conceptions
[1:52:50] now notice
[1:52:52] for without the law sin was dead
[1:53:00] let me ask you something
[1:53:02] it's the law holy it's the law righteous
[1:53:09] for I was the law I was alive verse nine
[1:53:12] I was alive without the law once why
[1:53:16] because if there's no law there's no sin
[1:53:19] isn't that right
[1:53:21] but when the Commandment came sin
[1:53:23] revived and I died and the Commandment
[1:53:26] which was
[1:53:28] to be unto death
[1:53:30] for sin taking the occasion by the
[1:53:32] Commandment deceived me and by its
[1:53:34] looming now just remember this that when
[1:53:36] Jesus Christ came he says I did not come
[1:53:38] to take away the law but I come to what
[1:53:41] magnify the law
[1:53:44] and many places in Matthew we won't have
[1:53:46] time to go into it this morning but he
[1:53:47] talks about you have heard that it's
[1:53:48] been said he has heard that he says I
[1:53:50] shall not commit a dog to you but I say
[1:53:52] unto you that whosoever look at the upon
[1:53:54] a woman Allah has already committed
[1:53:56] adultery in his heart
[1:53:57] and many other things he changed or
[1:53:59] whatever he magnified it and it made it
[1:54:02] stronger than what
[1:54:04] the Old Testament had it
[1:54:09] amen I want you to just try to
[1:54:11] understand something before we go on so
[1:54:13] that you'll understand it even better
[1:54:14] perhaps when we read it the law was to
[1:54:17] show you how sinful you are
[1:54:20] the law is Holy the law is righteous
[1:54:23] amen but we were Unholy and we were
[1:54:26] unrighteous and if you'll notice quickly
[1:54:28] for what the law could not do because it
[1:54:31] made wanted to make you whole and
[1:54:32] righteous didn't it the law wanted to
[1:54:34] make you whole and righteous don't
[1:54:35] commit adultery don't succeed don't go
[1:54:37] kill nobody huh all of these things that
[1:54:40] tried to make you do but he says it was
[1:54:42] weak through the flesh why because the
[1:54:44] king of Flesh couldn't do it it was
[1:54:46] asking of the flesh something it
[1:54:47] couldn't do
[1:54:49] that's why it killed you that's why it
[1:54:51] damned you
[1:54:53] all right let's go on
[1:54:58] all right
[1:54:59] deceive me and by it salute me wherefore
[1:55:02] the law is Holy
[1:55:06] and the Commandment holy and just and
[1:55:09] good
[1:55:10] sure and that good one that everything
[1:55:12] was good I shall love thy neighbor as
[1:55:14] thyself and so well that's all good
[1:55:17] but what do we do in this flesh we hate
[1:55:20] we love the neighborhood as it's good
[1:55:21] but let the neighbor do his bad and boy
[1:55:23] I'll tell you what that flesh really
[1:55:25] Rises up
[1:55:26] isn't that right
[1:55:28] sure
[1:55:29] was then that which is good made death
[1:55:32] unto me God forbid but sin that it might
[1:55:35] appear sin in other words he wanted to
[1:55:37] lie showed us how bad we were
[1:55:41] working death in Me by that which is
[1:55:44] good that sin by the Commandment might
[1:55:46] be
[1:55:47] exceedingly sinful for we know that the
[1:55:50] law is spiritual but I am carnal sold
[1:55:54] under sin
[1:55:56] amen
[1:55:57] that's flesh remember that we're talking
[1:55:59] about the black lungs what about that
[1:56:00] flesh is so other sin
[1:56:04] for that which I do I allow not for what
[1:56:07] I would that I do not but what I hate
[1:56:10] that I do the flesh is always working
[1:56:12] against your spirit
[1:56:15] always
[1:56:16] for then I do that which for then I do
[1:56:19] that which I would not I consent unto
[1:56:22] the law that it is good
[1:56:24] and I'm so what do you do what you're
[1:56:26] not supposed to do you're saying that
[1:56:28] the law is good but I'm bad
[1:56:31] amen
[1:56:32] for then it is no more I that do it but
[1:56:36] sin that dwelleth in me in other words
[1:56:37] it's the flesh that does it
[1:56:39] for I know that in me that is in my
[1:56:41] flesh dwelleth no good things for it to
[1:56:43] will is present with me but how to
[1:56:45] perform that which is I good I find not
[1:56:48] for the good that I would I do not but
[1:56:50] the evil which I would not that I do
[1:56:53] I want you to understand something
[1:56:56] Paul is talking about
[1:56:58] when you're living in your flesh
[1:57:02] okay that's when you're that's when
[1:57:04] you're feeding the back black dog more
[1:57:08] for the good that I would I do not
[1:57:10] believe which I would not that I do for
[1:57:13] if I would do that which I would not it
[1:57:15] is no more I that do it but it's the
[1:57:17] flesh it's sin that dwelleth in me I
[1:57:20] find then a law that when I would do
[1:57:23] good evil is present with me y'all know
[1:57:26] the story of the Indian isn't that right
[1:57:27] how you doing or there's a black dog in
[1:57:29] me and a black dog amen which one wins
[1:57:32] if on your feet the most even Paul
[1:57:34] talking about being dead to sin and
[1:57:36] everything he says I have to die
[1:57:38] daily
[1:57:40] for a delight in the law of God after
[1:57:42] the enward man but I see a law in my
[1:57:44] members worrying against the law in my
[1:57:46] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[1:57:48] the law of sin which is in my members oh
[1:57:51] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[1:57:53] me from the body of this death
[1:57:56] Hallelujah now notice the very next word
[1:57:59] Jesus began to thank God
[1:58:02] I thank God that through Jesus Christ
[1:58:04] Our Lord so then with the mind I myself
[1:58:06] serve the law of God but with the flesh
[1:58:08] the law of sin in other words if you go
[1:58:11] by your flesh you're going to law serve
[1:58:14] the law of sin
[1:58:16] but it's chapter eight it clears it all
[1:58:18] up Paul says there is there for now no
[1:58:21] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:58:22] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:58:24] after the spirit how many glad for that
[1:58:28] for the law of the spirit of life of
[1:58:31] Jesus Christ has made me free from that
[1:58:33] other law
[1:58:37] Glory
[1:58:39] let me know that if you're under the law
[1:58:40] of the flesh you are
[1:58:42] going to be depressed
[1:58:44] you're going to be sad you're going to
[1:58:46] be defeated you're going to be deflated
[1:58:49] but the holy ghost sets you from that
[1:58:52] law
[1:58:53] amen
[1:58:56] oh are you ready this morning let's
[1:58:58] let's need a drive to New Orleans that's
[1:59:01] clinch it
[1:59:05] now notice made me free from the law of
[1:59:07] sin and death
[1:59:08] for what the lock could not do in that
[1:59:11] it was weak through the flesh God
[1:59:12] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:59:14] sinful flesh and forcing condemned sin
[1:59:17] in the flesh so we see that how many
[1:59:18] knows it is only through Christ
[1:59:21] only by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:24] only by the power
[1:59:25] will you overcome
[1:59:30] amen
[1:59:32] now notice that the righteousness of the
[1:59:34] law might be fulfilled in US
[1:59:38] huh
[1:59:40] that's right I mean is to the
[1:59:42] righteousness of the law is fulfilled in
[1:59:44] you
[1:59:46] you don't hate your brother anymore you
[1:59:48] don't call him a fool
[1:59:50] because the Bible says you're worthy of
[1:59:52] Hell Fire when you call your brother a
[1:59:54] fool
[1:59:55] Jesus said you know you have heard that
[1:59:57] it has been said I shall love your
[1:59:59] neighbor and hate your enemy
[2:00:01] something like that but he says I say
[2:00:03] until you love those that despitefully
[2:00:05] use you and so forth love your enemies
[2:00:07] do good
[2:00:09] hey man you couldn't do that before I
[2:00:11] mean
[2:00:12] you know you can't do that outside of
[2:00:14] the Holy Ghost your flesh automatically
[2:00:16] resents it hates
[2:00:19] amen
[2:00:20] but there's a law
[2:00:23] when you get the Holy Ghost
[2:00:26] s there's a lot it says and it makes you
[2:00:29] do something
[2:00:30] it makes you do it
[2:00:32] makes me love everybody makes me love
[2:00:36] everybody makes me love everybody
[2:00:40] it's good enough for me that's why I
[2:00:43] like that good old religion give me an
[2:00:46] old time Legend
[2:00:48] give me the old-time Holy Spirit and the
[2:00:50] devil won't go near it
[2:00:55] let's read some more
[2:00:59] all right for the righteousness of the
[2:01:01] law might be fulfilled in US walk not
[2:01:03] after the flesh but after the spirit
[2:01:07] Hallelujah for they that are of the
[2:01:10] flesh after the flesh do mine the things
[2:01:12] of the flesh now
[2:01:14] come on Church how many knows but so
[2:01:16] that's probably where our problem is we
[2:01:19] still mind things too much of the flash
[2:01:21] it's why we're not having the victory
[2:01:22] that we should have in the spirit Realm
[2:01:26] [Applause]
[2:01:30] all right well not after the flesh but
[2:01:33] after the spirit for they don't have to
[2:01:34] deflect your mind the things of the
[2:01:35] flesh beginning after the spirit the
[2:01:37] things of the spirit for it to be
[2:01:39] carnally minded is death
[2:01:42] in other words if you got that kind of
[2:01:44] mind death lays there but to be
[2:01:46] spiritually minded is life and peace
[2:01:48] because the carnal mind is imminently
[2:01:51] against God it is not subject to the law
[2:01:54] of God neither in the can be
[2:01:58] your hate for people and your love for
[2:02:00] me people can't dwell in the same place
[2:02:03] huh you're either hating them or you're
[2:02:06] loving them
[2:02:08] no white black bird well let me let me
[2:02:10] you know
[2:02:19] intermingle
[2:02:21] the spirit
[2:02:23] with the thoughts of the flesh they
[2:02:25] won't
[2:02:25] one has to be deader you're either think
[2:02:28] one or the other
[2:02:29] either had the mind of Christ or you're
[2:02:31] thinking fleshly thoughts
[2:02:34] so now notice
[2:02:38] because the carnal mind is enmity
[2:02:40] against God it is not subject to the law
[2:02:42] of God neither indeed can be so than
[2:02:45] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[2:02:48] God
[2:02:49] I mean your flesh will never please God
[2:02:53] only that spirit amen
[2:02:56] not like this
[2:02:59] so the interface cannot be
[2:03:02] but with ye are not in the flesh boy you
[2:03:07] know if you take logic with that I'm
[2:03:09] still in the flesh I'm still here
[2:03:12] I'm still in the flesh no not really
[2:03:15] you're living in this body but if you're
[2:03:17] living according to this flesh and what
[2:03:19] it wants to do that's what Paul's saying
[2:03:20] then you're in a whole lot of trouble
[2:03:23] if you let your flesh get its way and do
[2:03:26] what he wants to do what will it bring
[2:03:28] forth it'll bring forth death every time
[2:03:31] that's because it's sin and the Paul
[2:03:33] said I'm free from the law of sin and
[2:03:35] death because if you sin Thou shalt
[2:03:37] surely die
[2:03:39] thank you
[2:03:41] law of sin is death
[2:03:43] amen
[2:03:46] but you
[2:03:47] are not either
[2:03:49] flesh but in the spirit
[2:03:54] you know I've been praying about in a
[2:03:56] series for this winter
[2:03:58] I thought about going back into
[2:03:59] Revelation back into Revelation series
[2:04:02] we've heard a lot of preachers talking
[2:04:03] about how uh you know how important
[2:04:05] Revelation is for us how many knows it's
[2:04:07] very very important
[2:04:09] Revelations
[2:04:11] you know how do you get Revelation from
[2:04:13] God
[2:04:14] amen
[2:04:16] by getting mad
[2:04:18] by cussing somebody out
[2:04:20] by being carnal
[2:04:23] by getting this gobble with your wife or
[2:04:24] your husband
[2:04:26] that don't help not does it
[2:04:28] no the only way that you get Revelation
[2:04:30] is by the spirit of God
[2:04:33] and then we won't go there another
[2:04:34] subjects now if any man have not the
[2:04:38] spirit of Christ he is none of his
[2:04:40] amen and if Christ be in you
[2:04:44] you
[2:04:45] the body is dead
[2:04:48] amen because of sin but the spirit is uh
[2:04:52] life because of righteousness
[2:04:56] let me go on down verse 12. therefore
[2:04:58] brethren we are debtors not to the flesh
[2:05:01] to live after the flesh for if we live
[2:05:04] after the flesh
[2:05:06] go
[2:05:08] die
[2:05:13] but if ye through the spirit mortify
[2:05:17] from what I understand that's clean
[2:05:18] cleanse mortified the Deeds of the body
[2:05:22] ye shall live amen for as many as are
[2:05:27] led by the spirit of God they are the
[2:05:29] sons of God
[2:05:31] Paul's glitter to the Galatians since
[2:05:33] chapter 5 verse 13 says for Brethren you
[2:05:35] have been called unto Liberty only use
[2:05:38] not your Liberty for an occasion to the
[2:05:40] flesh but look to but by love serve one
[2:05:42] another for all the law is fulfilled in
[2:05:44] one word even in this Thou shalt love
[2:05:47] thy neighbor as thyself
[2:05:49] but if you buy it and devour one another
[2:05:51] take heed that ye be not consume one of
[2:05:53] another
[2:05:54] this I say then walk in the spirit and
[2:05:58] he
[2:05:59] he shall not
[2:06:01] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[2:06:06] one amen amen huh
[2:06:09] isn't that the truth your black dog is
[2:06:13] never going to get the better if you're
[2:06:14] in the spirit like you ought to be
[2:06:17] amen
[2:06:20] praise be to God
[2:06:23] I'm supposed to be quitting but can I go
[2:06:26] further let's just go a little long this
[2:06:28] morning is that all right
[2:06:30] be sure to get up and jump a little bit
[2:06:32] and go like that it ain't gonna bother
[2:06:34] me I do it too
[2:06:41] all right you love him
[2:06:43] all right now notice all right
[2:06:48] I say this then walk in the spirit and
[2:06:50] he shall not fulfill the lust of the
[2:06:51] flesh for the flesh lusts us against the
[2:06:53] spirit and the spirit against the Flesh
[2:06:55] and these are contrary one to another
[2:06:57] isn't that right isn't that always a
[2:06:59] fight Black Dog white dog always
[2:07:01] fighting each other that you cannot do
[2:07:03] the things that you would huh but but if
[2:07:06] you are let
[2:07:07] by the spirit you Lord not under that
[2:07:10] law
[2:07:12] Ry I mean there's a flesh will ball get
[2:07:15] down the holy spirit will set you free
[2:07:18] I mean like some free
[2:07:20] here's the son has set free is free
[2:07:24] indeed
[2:07:26] hmm
[2:07:27] couldn't we stay on that for a while
[2:07:28] free from sin free from condemnation
[2:07:31] free from the blues free from free
[2:07:34] fearing of death free from being all of
[2:07:36] this
[2:07:38] so what is the law of the spirit the law
[2:07:40] of the spirit brings love into your
[2:07:42] heart it makes you love it brings faith
[2:07:44] and the law of faith in it is Invincible
[2:07:47] it conquers Giants it caught goliaths
[2:07:51] it kills all the Philistines the
[2:07:54] champion that Faith does
[2:07:56] there's a law in it
[2:07:59] amen
[2:08:00] that Spirit has a law to it makes you
[2:08:04] free
[2:08:05] amen
[2:08:07] but if you be led by the spirit ye are
[2:08:09] not under that law
[2:08:13] one more thought
[2:08:15] before we go to the comedian let's talk
[2:08:18] about
[2:08:19] a bird
[2:08:23] all right or let's go back a little bit
[2:08:27] human beings
[2:08:29] and how the Wright brothers
[2:08:31] they got that in their mind right
[2:08:35] they watch too many birds
[2:08:37] they thought they could fly
[2:08:40] huh
[2:08:41] how many people jumped off roofs and
[2:08:43] buildings and you know I remember being
[2:08:45] a young and dumb
[2:08:48] now that I'm not that I'm much smarter
[2:08:49] I'd like to take a medal and grab on a
[2:08:52] windy day and jump up huh dump up now
[2:08:55] can you imagine Mom and Daddy seeing
[2:08:57] your big old shock piece of metal
[2:08:58] jumping up in the air you know it's
[2:09:01] going to come right down the cross there
[2:09:02] and probably slit yourself
[2:09:04] but now the thoughts of jumping off of a
[2:09:07] roof or something or whatever huh
[2:09:11] we have it in our mind we want to fly
[2:09:14] and guess what we've realized that we
[2:09:17] could copy after the bird
[2:09:18] and said a couple wings and hey boy them
[2:09:21] funny first airplanes looked weird
[2:09:24] huh they were some boxy looking funny
[2:09:27] looking things
[2:09:29] but they had the right idea
[2:09:31] and look at where they are today
[2:09:34] up there in a big some jump
[2:09:36] boat air buses you know three three
[2:09:38] stories high hundreds and hundreds of
[2:09:40] people and taking up off the air and
[2:09:42] going from one country to the other and
[2:09:43] you know
[2:09:45] what what a great thing it was
[2:09:48] you know but guess what those airplane
[2:09:50] how many knows those airplanes have to
[2:09:51] be designed just the right way
[2:09:53] it's got to be the right aluminum it's
[2:09:55] got to be the right metal that they use
[2:09:57] a lightweight metal so it's not so heavy
[2:09:59] all these other everything about it now
[2:10:02] tell uh the undertale runner and the
[2:10:05] flaps on the back and the slaps on the
[2:10:07] side everything has to be right it's got
[2:10:09] to be made one is made right it can fly
[2:10:12] can I say something in the morning when
[2:10:13] you're made right you can fly
[2:10:18] when I think about helpless what are you
[2:10:21] made of is my question what are we made
[2:10:23] of
[2:10:24] [Music]
[2:10:25] yeah
[2:10:27] when God made a bird
[2:10:29] he made him a certain way didn't he
[2:10:32] their bodies are kind of slim
[2:10:35] isn't that right in their feathers from
[2:10:38] what I understand the prophet of God
[2:10:39] says try to pull a feather out of a big
[2:10:41] old Eagle one time you can't do it with
[2:10:43] a pair of pliers hardly you can't hardly
[2:10:45] pull their feathers out they're stuck in
[2:10:47] their wings so hard God puts a certain
[2:10:49] thing around that Wing to make sure that
[2:10:51] it don't it don't break
[2:10:54] then it don't come loose either not not
[2:10:56] come loose easy amen and I'll tell you
[2:10:58] what day them
[2:11:05] they're made for it
[2:11:08] they made a certain way to set their
[2:11:10] wings and men out there like you can
[2:11:11] Swatch them up there a minute their
[2:11:13] wings will be going like that a little
[2:11:14] bit and their tail a little bit like
[2:11:15] that and they're never fought them they
[2:11:17] just sailing they set their wings and go
[2:11:19] higher
[2:11:21] how many knows that you and I are
[2:11:23] supposed to be equals higher they
[2:11:25] go above the sound of the noise of the
[2:11:27] car the sound of the coming drama of all
