TRANSCRIPT
========================================
here's a lot of different ones the redeemer we mentioned all of them but uh tonight i want to go into a just a little bit different area perhaps and i don't guess i've ever preached on just this title but i want to preach on his name amen we know that all all of those other lily of the valley of brighton morningstar and all these different ones they're all titles but he has a name amen and that's what we're going to dwell on amen this evening with the help of the lord so let's our heads before we read the word father we do come before you humbly before you lord and thank you lord jesus in this nice middle of the january almost or beginning in january largest of no father that cold weather is coming lord jesus the whole world's cold people's heart doing much better we do thank you so much for it father and for everyone here lord everybody that's just feeling good we thank you lord jesus for all of our health and for our strength that you have given us lord we ask god that you'll bless them in jesus christ's name amen and amen do you want to compliment brother brad on his message sunday certainly was really good amen it was a real blessing and i know that come from his heart come from his soul and it certainly was a blessing to me i appreciate it appreciate his word amen but i want you all to be in prayer this coming sunday amen a young man like i said that is one of us once been raised right here here in the church amen and he's going to be speaking for a sunday morning amen so how many will pray for him see his fire that we see burning in his heart testimony that he's given amen of the witnessing that he's done to others and it reminds me a lot of me amen when i was his well about his age but maybe a little bit older but any anyway just the fire that's burning there the zeal that he has for the lord and i pray that god will just bless him richly amen and so come expecting how many will come expecting and pray for him and that that'll just have his way amen john god bless you good to see all amen tonight and so amen it's just good to be in the house of the lord amen i tell you what we could just stay here for a long time this is a nice good presence here isn't it presence of the holy spirit amen you go to work tomorrow it probably won't be like that you'll probably be stressed because something goes wrong but no stress here amen just good news listen i'm but good news here the gospel amen i like that preach the gospel the good news amen praise the lord so let's see here let's turn our bibles if you will and we'll begin with god's name amen god's name i mean he knows that jesus said i come in the father's name amen jesus came in the father's name and jesus the very word name jesus means jehovah savior amen he is jehovah amen jehovah is god amen so he came in his father's name amen but you know he said that i come in my name and you receive me not but others come in their name and then you will receive amen uh oh wait a minute there yeah there's that's much better turn it on and that helps all right thank you praise the lord it's nice when the light turns screen when you switch it over amen all right now where was we so let's turn our bibles to ephesians let's go to the book of ephesians amen i don't know about you but i have really enjoyed the series the lord has laid on my heart and really it's you know i heard even brother branham say you know the purpose of us coming together even is to bring up honor and glory and glorify him right and so that's really what it's all about it's not so much about us as it is glorifying who he is because without him we we'll begin with verse 18. the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us were who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right in heaven right hand in heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also that which is to come and has put everything under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things in the church with his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all amen may god has blessings to reading the word you can be seated this evening amen if you want to listen to a good message listen to god's provided place of worship 1965. amen brother branham talked and he went over into the old testament into the book of deuteronomy the 16th chapter and one of the last scriptures reads like this thou mayest not sacrifice the passover with any and any gate which the lord thy god giveth thee but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at evening and the golden of the sun at the season that thou come us forth out of egypt amen so we know that god had a a name he had a place a place that he chose to put his name and that is the place that the sacrificer was supposed to meet god amen and also this evening i want to talk about something we've heard quite a bit but i want to just look at it again because to me it's one of the greatest mysteries or the great revelations of this hour amen and it's an absolute blessing it's it is uh well reading what paul said he was just kind of expressing it and he says what is the exceeding great greatness of his power to us words your eyes being under under uh the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling amen so i just want to start out with saying we are privileged people we are privileged people you're a privileged person amen as long as he's on the throne sitting there making an intersection intercession you're a privileged person amen now we want to talk about the name and how many knows what the name of god is the lord jesus christ right that is the name amen and that's the that's the that's the that's the place amen that we want to focus on we know there is power in the name i like that song i'm not sure who's saying this but there's power in the name of jesus amen just that name amen is the sweetest name i know is jesus christ now we know that here this scripture talks about that he has a name and uh listen and dominion and every name that his name his name is above every he's not got the highest name but we know that he had taken what the lowest name which was the al-zibah does somebody know what beelzebub means now i don't know if it's the meaning of it or if perhaps beelzebub is supposed to be the chief of devils right in other words the chief of devils he took the name of the chief of devils wow took the lowest name that could be named and god gave him the highest name that that there is there is no higher name you know we think of great men we think of many different great men abraham lincoln george washington you know we think of different ones perhaps but they don't even compare close to the name of jesus christ amen amen praise the lord you love him no all right yes let me see here clock actions it's three if you want to go with me to collection three colossians 3 it says whatsoever you do in word or indeed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father by him so our actions every word everything that we say everything that we do is supposed to be done in the name of jesus christ amen whatever use in word whether it's a word or deed do everything in the name of jesus christ no other name that's the greatest name of all names amen uh just just rehearsing a scripture talks about going into all the world the gospel amen and it has to be done in his name in luke i believe it is that repentance and remissions of sin should be preached in his name beginning at jerusalem it had to be in his name because that's where the respect lies that's where honor lies i mean like we sang earlier talking about there's no other hope there's no other peace but in christ jesus none there's not nowhere else you can go there's no avenue there's no door to heaven amen we get buried with him by baptism i mean those we get buried by baptism in the name of jesus christ there's not another name given i was reading in this listening to this tape brother branham and i have thought about the i thought about the story but i didn't know brother madam actually said it in that date where he talked about how that he says you know there's a lot of fake uh people that claim to be spiritualists and so forth and he says but there's also some real ones out there because he's come in contact with them in foreign fields he said there were some people some some people that were devil worshippers and possessing the devil and so forth that would brought a table and it was suspending and it was doing some stuff i didn't go into detail of what it was doing what was going on there and they challenged he says you know if you got power bring it down and he said some guys jumped on the legs and were hanging onto the legs and that table flung them to the side they couldn't bring it down and then they said now you claim to be a a preacher and so forth what power do you have if you've got power to bring it down these thieves says i got no power but he represented one and he began to talk about how that he uh uh you know he said in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost come down huh it just goes to show that people that use that there's no more power in it there's no power why not not in this tape not in this place i believe it was but in one of them and that he said you know he used his titles and then he used uh his own name william branham he didn't go nowhere but he says then and they said in the name of jesus christ come down amen and their legs like come off [Music] i know wouldn't you like to have seen that i can only imagine in my mind where it just come down because why that's where power lays how many knows that's what the gospel paul said you know the gospel don't come in word only but it comes in come on church power and demonstration of the holy ghost we're living in the age folks when uh they'll be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god had a high minded having a form they have christianity formed they go to church huh they have a christian form but they deny the power thereof one place paul said you know some of these people that are causing trouble in the church and so forth i'm not going to worry about their words but i'm going to check their power because by me knows paul is the one that god stood behind he had the power oh my when we think about it there's power in that name how many knows that man many times you've heard of testimonies of people being in a car crash or almost getting killed and they'll just whisper that name jesus and he turns the whole thing amen that's that's the greatest name you can mention because he's right there oh my there's power in the name of jesus christ amen oh my i'm so i'm so happy for that oh my think about it there's power in the name of jesus christ in john 12 saint john 14 and verse 12 says verily very i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee should shall you do because i go unto my father he says and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do now notice he says in my name how many beliefs you gotta use the right name you got to be in the right place and you've got to be oh my whatever you shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son and if ye ask if you ask anything in my name i will do it praise the lord now how many knows that this was only made available and i i keep i keep going back to a little revelation that the lord gave me a couple weeks ago and that revelation is that jesus paid the price for this earth he already bought it huh how many does it's already paid for the earth is already paid for the only thing he has to do is claim what he has purchased we're waiting on him to come and make his claim [Applause] right wouldn't it be nice if if the rapture takes place whenever that rapture takes place he takes us out of here he makes a partial claim but he don't rent it he don't come until the day of the lord comes right and he begins to burn everybody destroy everybody burn everything wicked that's when he claimed and he's going to come cleanse it for himself but he's waited 2 000 years and not claimed it because why because he's got a work that he's doing and that work is what that work is redeeming you and me and that revelation to me was just not only and then it got into my mind about how that the prophet of god and what he said about what happened at calvary what jesus did and why this name is so powerful i'm going to read it again something we've heard a lot in this message but i want to say it again that whenever whenever jesus christ paid the price whenever he died and whenever he rose again and sat at the right hand of god he went up above every dominion above every notice he didn't he didn't claim not to be over anything right he claimed to be over everything every principality every power right there's nothing that is under his feet now and brother bennett makes the statement now satan don't have one right to nothing let me believe that the devil lost all his rights he did oh let me just say it while i got my mind and the only way that you can rob the devil of his rights is to come into that blood is to come into jesus christ if you don't come under that blood if you don't get washed by the blood if you don't get cleaned by the blood the devil still has a right on you not right remember that one woman that wanted to have prayer and so forth and and she was very nervous for years and years and years and years and she was got finally in brother byron's presence and so forth and the discernment says look when you were many years ago you had an affair with a woman and you and another woman you've had absolutely well nowadays you'd be a woman but you've had an affair with a man right and you've never made that right and so he says no matter how many gallons of oil you pour on them no matter how many preachers pray for him that devil has the right to be there because she's still not under the blood she's still not in christ that's the only way he has a right but it's only in christ and the prize has been paid the job has been done so to speak the work has been finished i mean now the work that it took to give us access and bring us back in the sons of god again that work has been finished it's done the devil has been stripped of every right that he had he has no more legal rights anymore oh thank god he's only a bluff amen only of love he was stripped of everything at calvary when jesus christ take this inner place and die to calvary satan has no legal rights over nothing no more but everything lays in the hands of the church and the believer satan has lost he's got nothing but a bluff even death itself amen like we have taught has lost its stinger like the bee when it stoned christ the bee the bee stinger stayed in him and he pulled that singer out hey there will be lands on you oh my get off me huh right but you listen you know if you could know that that bee doesn't have a stinger you can say hey birdy little bee how you doing wouldn't be afraid of at all would you but if you thought it could sting you you'd be worried about it well that's what the devil is he is a bee without a stinger poor thing no matter how much it buzzes and hums and how it looks it has no power amen praise be to god it lost its stinger death has no sting to the believer just like paul said o death where is your sting oh grave where is your victory but i have the victory through jesus christ our lord amen how many is bad for that that you don't have to be afraid of death anymore you don't have to be afraid to die why do you know the one that rose i mean you don't have to be afraid of the tribulation you have nothing to be scared of amen all right if i don't go any faster we may be here until 9 9 30. because i want to talk about how we can end that name i mean you got to be in that name in the name in the name of jesus in the name of jesus we have the victory but you got to be in jesus says if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and it'll be done how many knows that is that is bigger than perhaps our mind can comprehend tonight he said whatever you ask in my name i will do it wow whatever you ask i will do it it's a promise let me finish this and then i want to go to talking about how god has promised and said that since calorie now he hands the power to his children to become sons and daughters of god here not long ago right after he says this about death and the singer we was at walking to the grave of billy paul's mother mother he was just a little lad that morning before daylight he was walking down to put a flower on her grave and i took off my hat he took off his little old hat we walked down there and his little mother and sister laid in the grave we said upon the flowers down and the little fellow with his hat in his hand stood with his head bowed i felt down as just as the sun begin to i knelt down just as sun began to break daylight he started to cry i put my arm around him and said sonny look but in glory they wait our coming i said grave you can't hold them far beyond that rising under i can point you to an empty tomb this morning where one rose up from the grave and robbed satan of everything that he had amen i believe that i'm going to say it again it's no fault of god's it's going to be on the human being's fault now it's on us if thou can't believe all things are possible if you can get to the place that you can believe all right where one rose from the grave rob saving of everything he had and they were in him in other words mom and big tile were in him when they left here they've got to come forth just the same as he come forth god gave to promise heavens and earth will pass but his word cannot fail the hopes is built on nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness brother when you get encouraged enough to step out toe to toe to line with the devil and scat him off i believe that no matter what the devil does you've got a right now to get up to the devil and say you get off my property you make me miserable you give me a hard time but you ain't got no right just remind him i don't want you to remember that jesus defeated you with calvary you have got you you poor fella you've got all your rights taken away from you oh now notice then he says if i went to my house tonight and i got a legal deed from my house if i went there and someone was laying there drinking and carrying on and doing wrong i'd say get out of here friend well this is a house for human beings i've got a right to be here i would say you do not i possess this house it's mine he'd say well i got it right just like sickness enter the body or sin or whatever it is say well the other ones drink and the others do this and others be this way but he has no legal rights i could go down with my abstract need and go down to the court and say look here someone has moved in here and doesn't belong there this is mine that belongs to me the law would come up and put them out because i've got the abstract written deed to that property right brother and sister we have an abstract written deed tonight to salvation and divine healing the devil has no rights trust god and the holy spirit to put him out that's right that's all say amen oh i feel religious that's right so he's got absolutely no right because of the blood we have an abstract deed what is that abstract need that abstract title deed is nothing less than the holy ghost how many knows the holy ghost is the earnest of our salvation it's the earnest money it's what gives you a right over the devil amen but there's no other way now let's turn if you will acts 1 and uh acts 1 7 7-8 let's go to 6. and when when they therefore will come together they ask ask of him saying lord with thou at this time again restore unto us again the kingdom of israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you amen and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in judea and into the other most parts of the earth amen now in saint john i believe it is saint john 1. saint john 1 and 12 it says it this way listen he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons of god even to them that believe on what his name how many knows you can never become a son through any other religion no other name muhammad buddha i don't care what the name is you'll never become a son or daughter of god except through that name oh my how many thankful for that power you know there's a there is power in the name i absolutely know it is but there's let's just talk about the devil's power there's different powers and listen you might not think so but i truly believe that the holy spirit literally gives power to your physical body how many believes that sure let's take an example for one thing whenever the whenever the holy ghost burns in here real hard it causes you to love right it makes you love everybody it puts a smile on for it brings joy in your life it's power power to overcome just like cain when he was offering his fruits and his gifts and everything on the altar and he would have never imagined i don't imagine cain would have ever imagined that he'd take a rock and cave somebody's head in [Music] right i mean he was worshiping the lord he never thought he'd do something back but let what come on when jealousy come on him how many know there is a power in jealousy it's a wicked power it's an evil power you take a man or you know uh take a uh take a woman perhaps or a man cheating on on somebody you know and there's such jealousy or such hatred and such anger until you almost blow somebody's head off you'd have to refrain yourself if you let that hatred and that jealousy get on you too much there's no telling how wicked you'd be because the power of that hatred the power of that jealousy to where otherwise you're a very kind nice person perhaps huh there's evil powers but then there's good power amen i like that jesus said you'll receive power after the holy ghost oh my i mean they couldn't even stand for jesus his disciples man will stand for you peter says i'll die for you big old strong people i will die for you jesus says wait till you get converted all right that's what you need is a good conversion before the crows you'll deny me three times peter would have never thought it but when the pressure came and the right he didn't have the power that he needed right he didn't have the power that he needed but after the pentecost when the holy ghost power came down and then he was willing to when they were taking him to be crucified from what i understand and then he said don't let don't let that curiosity fire me up upright like you did here and i'm not worthy crucify me upside down think that's the way he went huh think about it power to walk into there to walk to death that's what we need how many believes that's what we need how many tonight would say that's what i need brother i need more of that holy ghost power i need more of the power that is in that name amen what the bible say god is rich to all who call upon his name that's oh it's it's the name of all names jesus jesus jesus there's just something about that name master savior jesus like the fragrance after a rain oh my you can get all backslid you can get cold on god and so forth and you realize that when you repent genuine repentance folks let me tell you something got something else the lord showed me here in the last couple days we got too many dried-eyed confessions people come and confess but they're not really sorry for their sin at all they don't feel so bad that they weep and cry and say god how could i do that lord forgive me a real godly sorrow huh get more places if you'd have that tender of a heart to where you're really sorry for your sins dry eye confessions we don't need them you don't get very far you got to be very serious about it you got to realize how terrible your sin is amen but i like that he gave them power to become sons of god amen notice jesus said in matthew 18 he says wherever two or three are gathered in my name there i will be in their midst i mean believe that all it takes is a couple people filled with the holy ghost amen and i believe it's under that same scripture i won't go there but i believe it's there also where he says and whatever two or three agree on anything i will do it that the father may be glorified in other words when to ask anything say god we do this but you got to pee in his name you got to do it in his name oh my power to become sons of god amen power to become in other words authority how many knows that you're got the authority now to become a son and daughter of god but you're going to use that authority you've got to use that power what is that authority what is that power how do you use it to believe that jesus died for you you say god for god so love not the world but for god so loved me that he gave his only begotten son that if i would believe in him i should never perish there's power and there's deliverance in that name there's healing in that name amen praise the lord and once you're in that name once you're a part of christ wow once you're in him wow you are going to inherit the earth i mean believe that everything is yours i've got it wrote down but i got the thought wrote down but i didn't go to scripture so i won't go to scripture but y'all remember where paul said all things are yours whether things present or the future isn't that right even death everything paul said everything he when he paid for the price he bought the whole world and he paid for every divine blessing he made so that if you want to you could become a son psy god you can be redeemed back to god you can go back into fellowship with god if you need healing you can have that if you want salvation you can have that whatever jesus said whatever you ask i will do it if you're in my name but you got to ask in my name because what can you do without him john 10. nothing you can do nothing without him without being in him and if you are in him we go from nothing to everything i mean believes everything's it all belongs to you why because you're in christ he owns it all he bought it all he is above every principality every power and his word says his word says that one day we won't have to live in this chaos anymore but we're going to come back and what's going to be on their feet whenever we walk the wicked shall be ashes under the soles of your feet if i take it literally folks we're going to walk on the ashes of the wicked they're going to get burned we're going to walk on their ashes that's the way i understand it and that right that's how much we are above all these things we just don't feel we fail to realize why do you think that brother banham could say and make the statement we are living a million miles below our god-given privileges because i don't think we were catching what privileges we really have at our disposal i don't care what it is you need to overcome you can if you'll believe i don't care what you you need spiritually it's been provided that's why the prophet of god could say if jesus was standing in this suit and you say heal me he'd say i can't that's death that's really big that's a mouthful i would never say the problem said but i understand where he's coming from he would tell you i already did i did that when i paid for by the blood that was put on my back by his stripes when i took those stripes all you have to do is accept it you have to receive it but abraham said the sinner can come up to the altar and cry for days and weeks and weep and repent for weeks and days and so forth but if that person don't ever accept what god has done you'll never get a deliverance you have to accept what god has done for you you actually have to accept your forgiveness amen receive it i accept the lord amen and go from there because testimony is like i can't never do it i can't overcome that's all the devil's talking that's the devil's language that's what he wants you to believe you'll never change it'll never no no no no real believer yes absolutely we believe that jesus died for you and it's yours aren't you glad for that where two or three agree on anything i will do it whatever you ask in my name that will i do but you have to first be planted in christ how many notes that as a christian when you become a christian when you are filled with the holy ghost when you are in that name you're a part of god whatever you do from there on how many knows we we're buried in jesus we rose in jesus whatever we do or whatever we say it's all supposed to be done in jesus christ's name how many think when you pray for somebody in the name of jesus christ receive your healing in the name of jesus christ receive healing why because there's power in that name first you get into it by joining some local church putting your name on a book somewhere how many knows it doesn't matter you know i trust all of us is filled with the holy ghost but if you're not filled with the holy ghost you remember everything like tabernacle but you're not maybe a member of the body of christ huh for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body it takes the baptism of the holy ghost amen and then the great thing about it is when you're a christian like i said we try to comprehend all these things ever had bought any kind of a food that said just add water just add water you become a person brothers and sisters when you're a christian because you have been planted in christ brother bram talks about how that an apple tree you take a seed of apple tree or whatever how little it is every bushel of apples that will ever be will be is in that and you plant it in the ground amen and that's how it is when a christian has that little form of the holy ghost baptism down in his heart god is planting it in your heart he's planted in there then what has to happen you put it in the ground and what is the first thing you do when you plant something if you're wise usually when i'm sowing grass or whatever i'll wait for about a day or so before the rains come then get it in the ground just before that rain because that water is really what's going to do the trick amen we are planted in christ and everything that we have need of is in that holy spirit in that name is right in you then praise god all you got to do is what just add water amen that's the prophet god says drink more than your allotted potion in other words head you know oh my i'm convinced if anybody's got cancer if anybody got sickness i don't care what it is what you really need to do is water the holy ghost in you huh because if you don't have the holy ghost or you're really really low on faith or even don't think you're worthy i mean second you think you're not worthy well then you probably ain't gonna get brother brother brother tommy sent me a little clip of brother billy paul at donny reagan's years ago i know it was years ago because brother donnie was sitting in the background with black hair and billy paul was up there just to testifying and i didn't catch all of it but i caught up where uh brother banham had prayed for billy paul and brother billy paul came back and said i didn't get it you know and he said no i'm not praying for you again it's really rough i'm not praying for you again you know you let me down and you let god down i'm not paying for you again god said to do it i prayed for you the way it's supposed to be you have to receive it and accept it i'm like whoa huh but that's about the truth he has to take it in he has to receive it it's a personal relationship when the elders of the church have prayed for you huh right then you go and you believe that it's done no matter how you feel no matter how long you feel bad amen praise the lord i hope sisterly his shoulders better already if not just hang in there it will when you get prayed for something but you come up forever every service it's not better and the second time you get prayed for and it don't matter you're gonna have less faith next time amen because it's really your faith in god that doesn't how many believes that god said it i believe it that settles it you love him amen whatever you ask in my name i will do it don't you just love him for those precious words acts one no it isn't one you see which one it is here acts 4. let's go to acts 4. how many believes that the disciples were filled with the power of god just as any christian or any church is filled with the power of god let me say this tonight if this church ever doesn't have the power of god in it anymore god will lead us hmm what did the prophet say god hates a powerless religion it hates a powerless religion if your religion doesn't have power in it some god doesn't like that like i talked last wednesday talk about we can say one thing but it's what we do i mean we can you can say you believe christ but have you got the power has god come and confirmed your faith amen praise the lord acts two and we'll begin with verse uh let me just start with verse one of chapter and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captains of the temple and the sad jewish seas and came unto them being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead and they laid hands on them and put them in to hold until the next day for it was now even tied how be it many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men which was about five thousand and it came to pass on tomorrow that the rulers and elders and scribes and anista high priests campuses and john alexander as many as were of the kindred of the high priest we're gathered together in jerusalem so here we are what a scene all the big shots all the main god everybody gathered and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name amen how many believes the name is important let me tell you something god winked at things just i'll get you to the rest of here in a minute god winked at the ignorance of martin luther and john wesley and all those that never used the name of jesus christ in salvation and baptism he went at it because they didn't know any better but once you are presented with uh with something like there was never nobody ever baptized in the titles of father son and the holy ghost in the bible boom right there it's over with you're now responsible to know that nobody was ever baptized that way and there's only one way to ever baptize and that is in the name of jesus christ you can't walk away from there and be the same anymore no you have to straight up turn down light amen aren't you glad that we was brought the name the name was brought back okay so he says what power what name have you done this remember the impotent man right then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined of the good teeth done by the impotent man by what means he has made hope let be it known unto you all and to the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth amen whom he crucified oh my what i had to hurt whom ye crucified god raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was said that not of you builders which is become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other hallelujah boy i wish the whole world would hear that there is no salvation in any other name you think you're going to go to heaven by some other name you're not going to go to heaven except by the name of jesus christ one day one day sooner or later every knee shall bow every tongue confessed that jesus christ is lord amen for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby you must be saved hallelujah but that blast trinitarians all jesus don't it father sunday holy ghost blast all the pieces it's the name of jesus christ no other name by what power they wanted to know what power does this they said by the name of jesus christ of nazareth is how this is done how many believes if you do anything worth anything it's going to be because of the name of the lord jesus christ the greatest name ever spoken from human lips they wrote many songs about the great name of jesus there's nothing like his name no name above it no greater name no other name that you can be saved by if you go preach the gospel you got to go do it we've got to preach the gospel in the name of jesus christ in my name they shall cast out devils how many knows that's the only way devils move is by the name of the lord jesus christ amen they shall lay hands on the sick in the name of jesus christ and they shall recover there's no other name given under men among me under heaven whereby you must be saved amen how many knows david we talk about david he's such a hero but when he confronted goliath when he come in front of goliath it happened samson he had a nazarite vow isn't that right all right don't ever cut your hair as long as you have that pow that hair you're a naz right unto him you've got the power of god times that he lied matter how many times samson lied right straight up lied to delilah many times well my passion is my power's in that well that was a character defect in samson but god still said hey he didn't do the wrong thing he got that hair that's his that's his vow that's that's that's a nazarite but when he finally give his secret away he lost his power how many knows that when you lose the power of god in your life it's like your engine shutting off going down the road it just don't run anymore you got to pull over and find out what's wrong amen i wonder hopefully nobody's in that shape tonight right don't have that seal don't have that peace like i used to have don't have that joy anymore amen stand with me will you bow your heads how many knows that you really need more of the power of god in your life you really can't hardly even witness to anybody coming to church is kind of a kind of hard it becomes hard if you don't have enough of the power of god i like it when i'm there and i'm like man it's three o'clock i wish they'd rush around so i could go to church you know i i hate waiting so long that's how i like to feel not all mine you know i you know you know how you can feel sometimes how your flesh will talk to you and and make you feel but if you're prayed up and god is real to you like he should be and the power of god is in you you know you don't dread the things that's godly and that's spiritual god bless those hands god bless you you just feel like you need more of the power of god lord jesus you see all of our hands this age this cares of life the different trials different things we go it has a way of just sapping us and if we don't keep our eyes focused on you stay prayed up and stay in christ and abide in the word like jesus says we are like a branch that's cut off and withered lord jesus we're living in amongst a lot of people that are just withered lord jesus and if we don't get life in this god you'll cast us into the fire and we don't believe that that's us because we believe you're to your church lord oh am i i heard your prophet say today he says you know this bride she's not going to be no lukewarmly odyssey and knows she's going to be full of the power of god lord we raise our hands and
