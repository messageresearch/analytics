[47:34] that's what happens when i don't put
[47:36] this sticky note in there
[47:41] okay
[47:42] numbers 21
[47:46] no that is not the one i was looking for
[47:49] okay

[48:03] i'll put a sticky there because i do
[48:05] want to read that one a little bit later
[48:08] okay
[48:09] back to deuteronomy 32.
[48:20] of familiar scriptures for us message
[48:22] believers
[48:28] 32
[48:29] we'll begin with go from 9 to
[48:32] 11. for the lord's portion is his people
[48:37] jacob is the lot of his inheritance
[48:40] he found him in a desert land
[48:43] and in the waste howling wilderness and
[48:46] he led him about and instructed him
[48:49] and he kept him as the apple of his eye
[48:53] and as the eagle steereth her up her
[48:56] nest
[48:57] fluttereth over her young spreadeth
[49:00] abroad abroad her wings taketh them and
[49:03] beareth them on her wings
[49:05] so the lord alone did lead him and there
[49:09] was no strange god with him
[49:12] amen may god bless the greeting of the
[49:13] word you can be seated tonight
[49:16] amen we want to look at tonight as
[49:18] jehovah eagle amen
[49:21] so jehovah typed himself here
[49:23] as the great eagle now
[49:27] i know there's different types different
[49:29] things he typed himself with and this
[49:31] wouldn't be on the same line perhaps as
[49:33] a father or
[49:35] or things like that but he typed himself
[49:37] with being the great eagle
[49:39] amen that found him in a weight howling
[49:42] wilderness and took care of him and kept
[49:44] it as the apple of his eye
[49:46] amen
[49:48] now as we begin to think about the eagle
[49:50] there would be
[49:52] there is so many things i mean so many
[49:55] good things
[49:56] that we learn from what the prophet
[49:58] taught us about the eagle amen
[50:02] and i want to i'm going to mention some
[50:04] things but i don't want to just go over
[50:05] things i've said a lot before i want to
[50:07] try to go in the direction that the holy
[50:09] spirit
[50:10] kind of had me go i feel like
[50:13] with the eagle and looking at the eagle
[50:16] we want to look at great mama eagle
[50:18] amen now i don't i've never watched
[50:21] eagles don't know all that much about
[50:22] him so i go by pretty much with what
[50:24] brother branham some of his experiences
[50:26] that he had let me just tell you
[50:29] what experiences that he had with him
[50:31] and then we'll take some lessons from
[50:32] that
[50:33] he says now as the eagle steers her nest
[50:35] this was in tulsa oklahoma on a sunday
[50:38] morning 1960. how i've watched them so
[50:41] many times a few days before the nest
[50:43] steering time comes
[50:45] the old mother eagle would get up there
[50:48] on the side of that nest and lay in
[50:52] many i've laid many a days in the warm
[50:55] sunshine watching them and just crying
[50:57] like a baby to see that big mother eagle
[51:00] they're large he says the mother eagle
[51:03] is larger than the father eagle so their
[51:06] wings bread spreads 14
[51:08] feet sometimes from tip to tip
[51:10] and she'll get up there and she'll strut
[51:13] around all over the nest like that and
[51:16] she'll go up to those little ones and
[51:18] she'll spread her great wings and scream
[51:22] and when she does sometimes it'll knock
[51:24] those little ones plum on their back
[51:26] see he wants them to do that that's what
[51:28] she wants them to do then they'll get up
[51:30] and she'll scream and my she's training
[51:33] them to hear
[51:36] her
[51:37] voice
[51:38] to know her voice
[51:41] amen so how many knows it's very
[51:43] important i believe that
[51:45] you know
[51:46] if we was all honest we would probably
[51:49] say i wish
[51:50] i would be
[51:51] a little more familiar with that voice
[51:56] amen
[51:58] so that i would know that voice at the
[52:01] slightest danger that i face
[52:04] you know because how many knows the holy
[52:06] spirit can warn you of a trap that the
[52:08] devil's fixing to lay or something's
[52:10] fixing to happen or you just get nervous
[52:12] and you don't know why and it throws you
[52:14] on your knees and say god i don't know
[52:16] why i'm nervous right now i don't know
[52:17] what's going on but whatever lord is it
[52:19] just you might wake up in the morning at
[52:21] three o'clock and don't know why you're
[52:22] wide awake and thinking about certain
[52:24] things or a certain person right
[52:27] but how many believes it's important
[52:28] that we know his voice
[52:31] mean it's it's very important i i the
[52:34] one thing about this message is one
[52:35] thing brother branham always taught us
[52:37] is stay with that god's word
[52:41] because we all got ideas we all got
[52:42] thoughts but thoughts but that's i
[52:44] believe that's one reason we know that
[52:46] he was an eagle was because he stayed
[52:48] right there with what god said it
[52:51] doesn't matter what it was
[52:53] amen because soon as you get off of that
[52:56] you get way off from left field real
[52:57] quick having a cow eating grass up on
[53:00] top of the tree or something like that
[53:01] amen
[53:03] but one of the things i want to look at
[53:05] tonight
[53:06] on this jehovah eagle is the material
[53:09] that jehovah mama jehovah or father
[53:12] jehovah eagle is made out of amen
[53:15] the material that he's made out of
[53:17] because as he describes here she'll get
[53:20] up there and she'll flop her wings and
[53:22] she'll go strutting back and forth and
[53:23] just flopping them wings and as i
[53:25] thought of my own little thought on it
[53:27] he says i thought you know maybe maybe
[53:30] she has sometimes uh when the babies are
[53:32] half grown or three quarter grown or
[53:34] whatever maybe she'll do a flyby
[53:37] and i don't know a hundred and they say
[53:39] 110 mile i don't know how it decides
[53:41] enormous amount of speed that they can
[53:43] pick up and how fast that they can go so
[53:45] you can imagine that that mama trying to
[53:48] teach those eagles what they're capable
[53:50] of
[53:51] and she comes perhaps a nosedive she has
[53:53] to have a nose she can fall faster if
[53:56] she does her wings a certain way points
[53:58] in a certain way she can fall really
[54:00] really fast she can actually fly i mean
[54:03] she can actually flap her wings
[54:05] downwards a little bit and make herself
[54:07] go faster than she would just fall
[54:10] amen but perhaps she comes by and she
[54:12] goes down here and
[54:14] all of a sudden there is a swoosh of
[54:17] wind almost like it would be a jet
[54:19] fighter going over a ship and doing a
[54:21] flyby when they're not supposed to right
[54:23] amen and just whoa you know just blow
[54:26] everybody right off back almost well
[54:28] that's about what baby she does for
[54:30] those little eaglets and those little
[54:31] eaglets were saying maybe to each other
[54:33] i can imagine they'd be saying like what
[54:35] what was that that was scary
[54:39] all right
[54:40] and you know the martin says you know i
[54:41] think that was mama
[54:43] that i look like mama
[54:47] i mean how many knows when you really
[54:48] think about god he's almost scary
[54:54] you better fear him
[54:56] you better have some reverend some fear
[54:58] for him is that right
[55:00] fear of the lord is the beginning of
[55:01] wisdom
[55:02] but she does that and she they're like
[55:04] wow that was neat
[55:06] you know and maybe she comes in and mice
[55:08] will come in there 100 miles an hour but
[55:10] just as she comes down she goes
[55:13] and stops and roost right on top of the
[55:15] mess and they're like wow that is really
[55:18] neat
[55:20] but she looks at him now notice let me
[55:21] read this on the next verse here he says
[55:24] after she talks about then it's so
[55:25] important that they know her voice i
[55:28] mean because of all the dangers they'll
[55:30] feel that and so forth and i want you to
[55:32] know what the eagle sounds like and when
[55:33] she spreads her great wing
[55:36] and say lookie here she says looky here
[55:39] i'm fixing to give you your first solo
[55:41] flight but first i want you to look
[55:44] at how
[55:45] big
[55:46] i am
[55:49] now i want to stop there for a while
[55:52] i want you to look because that's what
[55:54] we're doing you know what we're looking
[55:55] at it looking at god
[55:57] we're looking at who god is looking at
[55:59] what god is look at all the different
[56:01] attributes of what god is and the more i
[56:03] think about what god is the more i
[56:06] realize that even the scripture talks
[56:08] about look unto me he ends of the earth
[56:11] and be he saved amen because
[56:14] beside me he says there is no god
[56:18] and more i realize in everything we need
[56:21] god
[56:23] you need more god and god more than we
[56:25] realize
[56:26] look how great i am oh how sweet it is
[56:31] maybe sometimes sickness will knock us
[56:33] on our back maybe something else and
[56:35] when we can look at those great big
[56:37] wings of jehovah amen
[56:40] he allows us sometimes to go things and
[56:42] have things that happen so we'll look at
[56:44] him and realize how great he is
[56:48] oh my
[56:51] i've listened to the message called look
[56:54] brother i'm talking it was so true
[56:56] everybody is looking at something
[57:00] i mean as you you're focused on
[57:02] something
[57:03] you're looking at something you've got a
[57:05] goal you've got an objective i'm looking
[57:07] to do this i'm looking to do that and
[57:10] that right everybody's looking at
[57:11] something
[57:13] and it makes a huge difference in your
[57:15] life
[57:17] depending on what you are looking at
[57:20] it's important that we keep our eyes
[57:24] and we keep our focus on jesus
[57:27] how many knows as we see this world
[57:29] falling apart
[57:30] i'm telling you right here amen and out
[57:33] there it is time to not look so much at
[57:36] this world and begin to look at the
[57:38] other one because this one's going down
[57:44] i'll tell you what if i was on uh
[57:49] the titanic
[57:50] and it was going down
[57:53] what would you do
[57:54] what would you do if you was going down
[57:56] [Applause]
[57:58] you'd look for something wouldn't you
[58:00] you'd be looking for a lifeboat
[58:03] yeah you'd be looking hey where is lucky
[58:05] we didn't care about how fine the shrimp
[58:07] and the chicken is in the kitchen
[58:09] you wouldn't care about how good that is
[58:11] the leftovers inside of the other the
[58:12] second no you'd be making sure you get
[58:14] on the lifeboat that's what we're doing
[58:16] amen because the world's going down and
[58:18] you better begin to look for the life
[58:20] look amen at what you're going to step
[58:23] into
[58:24] that is going to save you it
[58:27] so back to the eagle we look at this and
[58:29] she
[58:30] flaps her wings
[58:32] amen and she shows them
[58:37] what she's made out of
[58:40] not only what she can do because we can
[58:41] stay there all night because jehovah is
[58:44] a great god
[58:46] he's powerful god
[58:48] on the way to church i thought about how
[58:49] that the uh omnipotence the
[58:52] all-powerfulness
[58:53] of god
[58:55] is totally inconceivable to you and me
[58:59] your human mind can never comprehend the
[59:02] power of god
[59:05] amen
[59:06] how can he could just speak the word
[59:08] and the gases and the neutrons and all
[59:11] these other kind of gases if he says he
[59:13] wants a piece of wood he wants a piece
[59:15] of metal he'll have certain chemicals
[59:18] come together
[59:20] right
[59:21] and they'll form
[59:23] into whatever he wants it to be i can't
[59:25] understand how that could ever happen
[59:27] but it does
[59:29] how did he could have made the solar
[59:31] system the galaxies and everything else
[59:34] just to try to comprehend so you don't
[59:36] have to try to figure out his power do
[59:38] you
[59:38] but i like to see what his power can do
[59:41] we see the results of his power
[59:44] amen
[59:45] of what how great jehovah is when we
[59:49] look at the bible now
[59:51] how many knows that just looking just
[59:53] it's just the idea of looking
[1:00:00] just looking
[1:00:02] can save you
[1:00:06] look unto me
[1:00:07] right
[1:00:08] and be saved
[1:00:11] remember the brass serpent in the
[1:00:12] wilderness
[1:00:14] they all had sinned
[1:00:17] and they were bitten of serpents
[1:00:21] they murmured i believe it was
[1:00:23] complained and murmured and because of
[1:00:25] their murmur and complaining god send
[1:00:26] serpents among them and they were
[1:00:28] getting bit
[1:00:30] bitten the leg beating the five bit
[1:00:32] everywhere everybody was coming into the
[1:00:34] doctor with snake bites a lot of them
[1:00:36] were dying of snake bites and saved
[1:00:38] moses help us help us
[1:00:40] and what did they do
[1:00:42] they went and they got god told moses
[1:00:46] to go ahead and take a serpent and put
[1:00:48] it on a pole
[1:00:50] right
[1:00:51] and he says and it'll come to pass that
[1:00:53] whoever is bitten if they will look at
[1:00:58] that serpent on the pole
[1:01:00] they'll live
[1:01:01] [Applause]
[1:01:05] now what did we find out that the
[1:01:07] serpent on the pole represented
[1:01:10] sin
[1:01:12] judged
[1:01:14] huh sin
[1:01:16] judge because it was a type of christ
[1:01:18] hanging on the cross
[1:01:21] now let me ask you something was christ
[1:01:23] sinful on the cross
[1:01:26] no
[1:01:27] but the bible says he bore our sin
[1:01:32] he took hours into calvary on the pole
[1:01:36] right and we have to look to him if you
[1:01:40] ever expect to get saved
[1:01:43] if you're ever going to get blood you
[1:01:45] can't look at bo buddha muhammad any
[1:01:47] other religion not any other religion
[1:01:49] you can look at and be saved
[1:01:54] you have to look
[1:01:57] at christ
[1:01:58] on the cross
[1:02:00] represented
[1:02:01] that wicked serpent
[1:02:04] the evil in every one of us is what put
[1:02:07] him there
[1:02:09] right
[1:02:10] and we look at our sacrifice that he
[1:02:13] died for us and that's our avenue to
[1:02:16] life
[1:02:18] whosoever looketh upon it amen
[1:02:20] will be saved amen goes right along
[1:02:23] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[1:02:25] perish
[1:02:26] amen look and live look and live look at
[1:02:29] jesus christ and live
[1:02:31] it's recorded in god's word hallelujah
[1:02:34] it's only that we look and live right
[1:02:38] look
[1:02:39] and live
[1:02:42] how many believes is important
[1:02:44] what you look at
[1:02:48] i was thinking about this and i thought
[1:02:49] you know there's another way of
[1:02:52] looking and that's with your hearing
[1:02:56] right
[1:02:57] you look with your hearing
[1:03:01] all right
[1:03:02] because the bible says you know we faith
[1:03:04] comes by what
[1:03:06] hearing
[1:03:07] hearing the word of god
[1:03:09] preaching and talking about these things
[1:03:11] of how great god is brings faith
[1:03:14] now right preaching the word of god
[1:03:17] brings faith
[1:03:20] but it's not so much just the hearing
[1:03:22] but
[1:03:23] if you ever have talked to somebody
[1:03:26] and they're explaining something to you
[1:03:28] with their words and you're hearing
[1:03:29] their words and they say do you see what
[1:03:32] i mean
[1:03:35] huh
[1:03:36] now if you're still confused you better
[1:03:38] do like me no you better explain that
[1:03:40] about twice more and then i'll get it
[1:03:43] right
[1:03:44] but once i get it yeah i see what you
[1:03:47] mean because you heard with your ear
[1:03:50] but you understood with your heart the
[1:03:52] bible says the eyes of your
[1:03:54] understanding
[1:03:56] being
[1:03:56] enlightened in other words you have to
[1:03:59] understand
[1:04:01] amen
[1:04:02] so that's another way
[1:04:04] that we truly see
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:08] and that how many knows that's something
[1:04:09] that's given of god
[1:04:11] for being able to comprehend and to
[1:04:12] understand
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:15] is something that's given by grace
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:22] all right
[1:04:23] another thing that i wanted just say is
[1:04:26] i made a mention about everybody's
[1:04:28] looking at something it it it goes back
[1:04:30] to the scripture
[1:04:31] that wherever your treasure is there
[1:04:33] your heart will be also
[1:04:35] your mind your
[1:04:37] your that's what you're focusing on
[1:04:39] wherever your treasure is
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:48] i want to share a terrible testimony
[1:04:50] with you
[1:04:51] but
[1:04:53] um let me see this
[1:04:56] i wanna i wanna talk about
[1:04:58] just this is a little bit on the side
[1:04:59] like
[1:05:02] um
[1:05:04] if i can find it
[1:05:14] in psalms 37
[1:05:18] this is what i've
[1:05:20] been trying to do this is what i try to
[1:05:22] do all the time
[1:05:24] but
[1:05:25] with this little series that i've been
[1:05:27] speaking of it's just helping me a
[1:05:29] little bit more to do so
[1:05:32] and that is to think about him
[1:05:34] that is to keep my thoughts keep my eyes
[1:05:39] on who he is amen and what he is
[1:05:43] now the bible talks us that we should do
[1:05:45] something and that is that we ought to
[1:05:47] delight
[1:05:49] ourself in him
[1:05:52] delight yourself
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:57] have a good time in him
[1:06:00] delight yourself
[1:06:02] in psalms 37 and 4 there's a promise
[1:06:06] given that says delight thyself
[1:06:09] also in the lord and he shall give thee
[1:06:12] the desires of thy heart
[1:06:17] i can't tell you how many times
[1:06:21] that i've
[1:06:22] desired something
[1:06:24] that i needed something this is just
[1:06:26] naturally speaking now this
[1:06:28] this goes in every realm
[1:06:30] but and it was some time later then all
[1:06:34] of a sudden god just give it to me i'm
[1:06:36] like you know i didn't even pray for
[1:06:37] this
[1:06:39] but god knew i wanted it
[1:06:41] amen
[1:06:43] so
[1:06:44] me and donna we're trying to build an
[1:06:45] addition onto our house just in case

[1:08:27] then just stalled out
[1:08:29] it cranked it up and it hurt like
[1:08:31] getting this that's a good sign if it
[1:08:33] burst a little bit it's good i'm gonna
[1:08:35] have to put an engine you know maybe on
[1:08:37] it but it'd just die out you know
[1:08:40] everything else was fine
[1:08:42] i says well
[1:08:43] pretty good price on it they came and
[1:08:45] gave me a good price on it and i says
[1:08:47] you know
[1:08:48] i take it and i told mike on the way
[1:08:49] back i said i don't know what's wrong
[1:08:50] with this engine and i'm gonna check the
[1:08:52] fuel filter and i'm gonna go through it
[1:08:54] you know do my mechanical he says dad
[1:08:55] you gotta just take it to the small
[1:08:57] straight to the small engine shop and
[1:08:58] help me
[1:09:00] you know
[1:09:01] don't make it certainly fix it basically
[1:09:02] no not really but anyway he was like
[1:09:04] just get it fixed i said well we come
[1:09:06] home and
[1:09:08] pulled that thing off of there and
[1:09:10] and donna says well check the oil check
[1:09:12] the oil check the oil all right and
[1:09:14] donna had prayed that this morning that
[1:09:16] morning right donna lord i sure wish
[1:09:18] you'd give him a mixer sometime
[1:09:20] and uh she prayed and so forth the lord
[1:09:22] knows i've wondered on phone for a while
[1:09:24] and then when i went out there and i
[1:09:26] turned that little thing open where the
[1:09:27] oil goes in and when i opened that up
[1:09:29] you know it's kind of at an angle and
[1:09:31] just look at a little dipstick little
[1:09:32] thing when i open that up oh i'll come
[1:09:34] gushing out i'm like i know it ain't
[1:09:37] supposed to be that full
[1:09:39] i grabbed the side of that mixture and i
[1:09:41] picked it up and dumped some of that out
[1:09:43] put it back down put it back in
[1:09:48] perfect ever since they just put a
[1:09:50] little too much hole in it
[1:09:52] i'm like woo
[1:09:54] thank you lorna that's the way to start
[1:09:55] out of the morning i was gonna have to
[1:09:57] spend 100 bucks almost for today's
[1:09:59] rental and i got for about five more
[1:10:00] rentals and i got me a knife
[1:10:03] but anyway so i was going to say you
[1:10:05] know i called him back i said hey all
[1:10:07] that was wrong with it's just with
[1:10:09] little oil can i pay you more no i
[1:10:11] didn't do that i was happy with what
[1:10:14] but the lord had given me
[1:10:17] amen but i thought you know that
[1:10:19] scripture came to me that scripture came
[1:10:22] to me because the lord knew what i've
[1:10:23] wanted what i needed and i've won it
[1:10:25] when i says boy i sure wish i wouldn't
[1:10:27] have to think about the 200 i need to
[1:10:29] lay so i don't have to lay the rest the
[1:10:31] next day you know and get the mixture
[1:10:33] again because it's just me
[1:10:35] and boy me and my wife we was just
[1:10:37] praising the lord all day and i said yes
[1:10:39] look there honey it don't have to go
[1:10:40] home tonight i'm i'm chilling i'm just
[1:10:43] taking it easy i'm not playing so fast
[1:10:46] now
[1:10:47] but i'm telling you how many believes
[1:10:49] just just just delight yourself in the
[1:10:51] lord
[1:10:52] delight yourself in god
[1:10:56] and watch what happens
[1:10:58] the bible's promise is that he will give
[1:11:01] you the desires
[1:11:03] of your heart if you delight yourself in
[1:11:05] the lord
[1:11:07] because i'm telling you there ain't
[1:11:08] nothing else in this world that you can
[1:11:10] look to that would even delight a person
[1:11:12] or make you feel good or bring joy to
[1:11:14] your life there is nothing else you can
[1:11:16] look at
[1:11:18] why shouldn't we look at him more why
[1:11:21] shouldn't we keep our eyes on him so why
[1:11:23] shouldn't we see it how great he is
[1:11:27] we talk about these uh sams of killing a
[1:11:30] thousand philistines and becoming
[1:11:32] invincible
[1:11:34] thousands of years ago but he is the
[1:11:36] same tonight god is just alive today as
[1:11:40] he ever will was or ever will be
[1:11:44] folks one of these days his voice will
[1:11:46] be silenced perhaps and you won't hear
[1:11:49] it anymore but i'm here to tell you god
[1:11:51] will never be silent god will never
[1:11:54] sleep god will never rest i will never
[1:11:56] die
[1:11:57] he'll always be
[1:12:01] and he's the one that'll raise us up
[1:12:04] help me believe that delight yourself in
[1:12:06] the lord he'll give you the desires of
[1:12:08] your heart
[1:12:10] what did paul what did david say
[1:12:13] he said the man is blessed that walks
[1:12:16] not in the counsel
[1:12:18] of the dome that knows that don't
[1:12:19] delight in god of the ungodly nor
[1:12:22] standeth in the way of the sinners nor
[1:12:24] sitteth in the seed of the scornful
[1:12:27] but his delight
[1:12:31] folks i don't know about you but when
[1:12:32] i'm sitting down and having me a good
[1:12:34] uh butter pickle and ice cream i'm
[1:12:36] having me a nice little delight
[1:12:40] when i get down on my prayers and say
[1:12:42] lord how are you this morning i love you
[1:12:44] you're such an awesome god we're having
[1:12:46] a little delight time with the lord
[1:12:50] when we come to church we come here to
[1:12:52] delight ourself and not to be some stiff
[1:12:54] starchy
[1:12:56] to give the lord our blame and our tired
[1:13:01] huh
[1:13:03] no he deserves the best
[1:13:06] but his delight is in the law of the
[1:13:08] lord and any law does he meditate
[1:13:11] day and night
[1:13:15] praise be to god
[1:13:18] now notice
[1:13:19] day and night he'll be like a tree
[1:13:21] that's planted by the rivers of water
[1:13:26] you won't be dried up you won't be
[1:13:28] shriveled up
[1:13:29] you'll have plenty of water you'll have
[1:13:31] plenty of moisture
[1:13:34] you'll have plenty of holy spirit
[1:13:36] moisture
[1:13:38] hello
[1:13:39] that bringeth forth his fruit and his
[1:13:41] season his leaf also shall not wither
[1:13:44] and
[1:13:47] whatsoever he doeth
[1:13:49] shall prosper
[1:13:52] nothing will stand in your way
[1:13:54] whatever you do
[1:13:56] will prosper
[1:13:59] wow
[1:14:00] aren't you glad for that
[1:14:02] oh it don't always look like it didn't
[1:14:04] look that way for daniel
[1:14:07] but daniel he looked up to christ three
[1:14:08] times a day didn't he got on his knees
[1:14:11] he kept his eyes on the lord kept his
[1:14:13] eyes on god amen it looked terrible they
[1:14:16] threw him into the line said but guess
[1:14:18] what he came out just fine
[1:14:21] he prospered became uh maine one of the
[1:14:24] main leaders
[1:14:26] amen my to think of all the people that
[1:14:30] have looked at him i mean not the three
[1:14:32] hebrew children i love talking about him
[1:14:35] why they had their eyes set on him we
[1:14:39] don't know whether we will but they're
[1:14:41] looking at and we know that he can
[1:14:44] and we're so if he does wonderful if he
[1:14:47] don't that's up the hill but i know he
[1:14:49] can but we're not bowing to you
[1:14:52] because it's against what he told us to
[1:14:54] do they kept their eyes on him and
[1:14:56] because he kept their eyes on him
[1:14:58] he kept their eyes on them
[1:15:00] how many believes god keeps his eye on
[1:15:02] you
[1:15:05] he's got his eye on every one of us
[1:15:09] i he just don't see you when you come to
[1:15:11] church
[1:15:13] and then he don't see it just when you
[1:15:14] do good things he sees when you do bad
[1:15:17] and he sees you and with every thought
[1:15:20] that goes through your
[1:15:22] mind
[1:15:24] a christian it should be very troubling
[1:15:26] to you just to have a wrong thought
[1:15:30] huh
[1:15:31] just to have a wrong thought oh that
[1:15:33] that bothers me why
[1:15:35] why does that go through my head
[1:15:37] huh
[1:15:40] all right
[1:15:41] let's go on let's look at the materials
[1:15:43] that she's made out of first of all
[1:15:47] this
[1:15:48] eagle
[1:15:51] is
[1:15:53] light
[1:15:55] amen
[1:15:57] she's light
[1:15:59] and i thought about that eagle being
[1:16:01] able to fly
[1:16:02] you know
[1:16:03] birds for to be able to be flying they
[1:16:05] have to have
[1:16:07] feathers
[1:16:08] you've heard light as a feather
[1:16:11] do you ever see one of them chicken
[1:16:12] feathers a little bit fluffy feathered
[1:16:14] me just kind of
[1:16:19] like you said everything it's so light
[1:16:24] jesus says come unto me all ye who are
[1:16:25] weary and heavy laden that i will give
[1:16:27] wrestling still from my yoke is easy and
[1:16:29] my burden
[1:16:31] is
[1:16:32] light
[1:16:34] you got to be light people
[1:16:36] not heavy
[1:16:38] in order to fly
[1:16:40] you can't be heavy
[1:16:42] so i was thinking about this weight and
[1:16:43] what they make airplanes out of
[1:16:47] you know
[1:16:50] i got to thinking about
[1:16:51] being an airplane pilot sister chinese
[1:16:53] and i told my wife i said if i was an
[1:16:55] airplane pilot i said you'd have i'd be
[1:16:58] using the
[1:17:00] highways probably that'd be i'd be
[1:17:02] saying if you don't like the way i drive
[1:17:04] get off the highway i have to plan to be
[1:17:06] somewhere i'm way too rough cut for all
[1:17:08] that
[1:17:10] like almost like they say if you don't
[1:17:11] like my driving get off the sidewall
[1:17:15] but one thing i looked up and the bird
[1:17:17] of any airplane any airplane has to be
[1:17:20] made out of they get the lightest
[1:17:22] material on every front that they
[1:17:25] possibly can whether it's a mixture of
[1:17:27] this that or the other but one of the
[1:17:29] main
[1:17:30] ingredients in an airplane is titanium
[1:17:33] a real real strong but a light the
[1:17:37] lightest metal you can get
[1:17:40] how many knows they will go everywhere
[1:17:41] wherever they have to go to mine that
[1:17:43] and to get that to get those airplanes
[1:17:45] as light as they can folks i don't know
[1:17:47] about you but when i get up in the
[1:17:48] airplanes and then wings go to bend in
[1:17:50] about six feet i'm like is that supposed
[1:17:52] to do that
[1:17:55] the answer is yes they're actually kind
[1:17:58] of flimsy
[1:18:00] because i'll tell you what they're not
[1:18:02] made for crashes
[1:18:04] no they are not made for christ they
[1:18:06] will fall apart in a heartbeat in a
[1:18:09] crash
[1:18:10] they made the fly they were made to hold
[1:18:12] their weight
[1:18:13] but they're not made to hit things
[1:18:16] but that tandem and that it was made out
[1:18:18] of something light and that's what let
[1:18:20] me tell you something that's what mama
[1:18:21] eagle is made out of and that is what
[1:18:23] you're supposed to be made out of
[1:18:26] something that's light doesn't have a
[1:18:28] lot of weight to it
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:32] and the thing of it is is the eagle is
[1:18:35] made to soar it's made to fly above
[1:18:39] all the earthly things
[1:18:42] huh
[1:18:44] ask yourself this
[1:18:46] are you still bound down by earthly
[1:18:49] things
[1:18:51] are you flying above it
[1:18:54] huh
[1:18:55] because remember jesus is all above all
[1:18:58] of it now
[1:19:00] hell death the grave sorrow depression
[1:19:02] and all he went he was raised way up
[1:19:04] above it
[1:19:06] and he got up into heavenly places like
[1:19:09] the eagle is up in heavenly places
[1:19:14] and then he says you who were dead in
[1:19:16] sins trespasses right
[1:19:18] he's quickened us and he also raised you
[1:19:21] and me up into
[1:19:23] heavenly place if you want to know what
[1:19:26] heavenly places are begin to think about
[1:19:28] god more
[1:19:30] how great he is
[1:19:34] just begin to try to fathom his power
[1:19:36] try to fathom his omniscience
[1:19:39] omnipresence
[1:19:41] and how great he really is
[1:19:44] he
[1:19:46] swooshes those wings and
[1:19:48] look at that look at that look at this
[1:19:50] look at this look at this
[1:19:53] huh
[1:19:54] and that thing could fall right
[1:19:56] backwards out of the nest on off of a
[1:19:58] cliff
[1:20:00] all it is is basically just
[1:20:03] did you know
[1:20:04] i'm sure you've all fantasized but
[1:20:07] you see buzzers and you see other birds
[1:20:09] flying and soaring but wouldn't that be
[1:20:11] nice
[1:20:12] huh
[1:20:14] huh you think boy wouldn't it be scary
[1:20:16] up there we just we gotta have this
[1:20:19] right here this is not scary right here
[1:20:22] this is solid right
[1:20:23] but you know
[1:20:25] but up there you get off the ground a
[1:20:27] little bit it gets scary for us because
[1:20:29] we just wasn't made with wings
[1:20:32] but those birds were trying to enter
[1:20:34] into their thought whenever they
[1:20:36] fall out over top of that it's just like
[1:20:38] them taking a step they don't even think
[1:20:40] about heightened scared or nothing
[1:20:43] because it's just like taking a walk to
[1:20:44] them they do it all the time right
[1:20:47] it's completely common to them why
[1:20:49] because they don't have to be scared
[1:20:52] because they know what this can do what
[1:20:54] it'll do
[1:20:56] so it has to be takes lightness not a
[1:20:58] material let's just talk about
[1:21:00] a christian's material and and i'm going
[1:21:02] to look at it a little bit different
[1:21:03] because you can also take this as your
[1:21:05] warfare and your weapons and so forth
[1:21:10] how many knows that papa god
[1:21:13] is made out of love
[1:21:16] he's the very essence of love
[1:21:20] amen
[1:21:23] and he's made out of faith
[1:21:26] he's made out of faith he's made out of
[1:21:28] love and those are probably the main
[1:21:30] ingredients that i want to talk about
[1:21:32] tonight for a little bit
[1:21:37] all right we're talking about light
[1:21:39] material
[1:21:40] heavy material faith is a light material
[1:21:47] doubt
[1:21:49] is a heavy material
[1:21:51] sin
[1:21:53] is a weight how many knows there's a sin
[1:21:56] that so easily be said lay aside every
[1:21:58] weight
[1:21:59] get rid of every weight
[1:22:01] so when you're gonna fly
[1:22:03] how many believes that we're all eagles
[1:22:05] tonight we all wanna learn how to fly a
[1:22:07] little better
[1:22:09] so it's important
[1:22:11] what kind of material that you're made
[1:22:13] out of
[1:22:15] you have to have
[1:22:16] the kind of material as the prophet said
[1:22:18] you can take a pliers and you just can't
[1:22:20] rip
[1:22:21] them feathers odd hardly even with a
[1:22:23] pair of pliers they're in they're so
[1:22:24] hard
[1:22:25] they're so stuck
[1:22:28] but they're light
[1:22:29] so when you want to get something to fly
[1:22:31] they said you know about airplanes it
[1:22:33] says if they don't use a lot of heavy
[1:22:34] steel it'll be way too heavy and never
[1:22:36] make it off the ground
[1:22:38] right so they don't use a heavy steel
[1:22:41] like what you might think they would use
[1:22:43] can't be heavy
[1:22:45] so i brought a rock tonight
[1:22:48] now this i went out there some of y'all
[1:22:50] may have seen me but you know this makes
[1:22:52] a good skipping rock if you throw that
[1:22:54] fast enough
[1:22:55] the only reason this is going to fly is
[1:22:57] because of the power that's behind it
[1:23:01] but you throw this
[1:23:03] and it's going straight down
[1:23:05] it's just a weight
[1:23:07] way too heavy
[1:23:09] right
[1:23:10] way too heavy
[1:23:11] i thought there's another material and i
[1:23:13] took one of my notepads here
[1:23:16] you take the right kind of material i
[1:23:18] haven't even i don't know if i even test
[1:23:20] like this but you remember them little
[1:23:22] things
[1:23:23] yeah
[1:23:25] so we're going to try that all right
[1:23:27] whoo hey it's not supposed to go down so
[1:23:29] fast but it did
[1:23:31] but it flies right what'd you get for
[1:23:33] that for me here can't leave trash
[1:23:35] laying around
[1:23:36] throw it back at me would you
[1:23:38] maybe it'll fly better for you
[1:23:40] oh yeah there you go
[1:23:42] huh
[1:23:44] that's design right
[1:23:46] designed shaped
[1:23:49] to fly
[1:23:51] now you get a little engine or something
[1:23:53] out here and it's gonna go right that's
[1:23:55] to make them all the time
[1:23:56] tour airplanes you know it'll go why
[1:23:58] because it's light
[1:23:59] it's just feather light as it goes
[1:24:01] that's what you and i
[1:24:03] have to be if we're going to soar above
[1:24:05] the world
[1:24:06] sometimes you can't be all weighed down
[1:24:08] let me tell you something this world is
[1:24:10] full of people
[1:24:12] that are weighted down
[1:24:16] how many happy people do you find
[1:24:19] not a lot of you don't find many people
[1:24:20] happy
[1:24:22] you can't hardly
[1:24:24] well
[1:24:25] sometimes i i try sometimes to wave with
[1:24:28] people people won't wave at you
[1:24:30] you look at people when you go to the
[1:24:32] grocery store and you want to know how
[1:24:34] they don't even look at you it's just
[1:24:36] keep
[1:24:37] huh
[1:24:38] and and we get that way sometimes right
[1:24:40] i do that sometimes i get such a hurry
[1:24:42] you know and you know you know
[1:24:45] but he doesn't you don't have to look
[1:24:46] far to know that most of this world and
[1:24:49] most
[1:24:50] of
[1:24:51] the people out there have got all kinds
[1:24:54] of weight on them now how many knows
[1:24:55] that we have peace with god and we get
[1:24:57] light because of the faith that we have
[1:25:01] faith in almighty god is the absolute
[1:25:04] material to pick you up it'll take you
[1:25:06] out of their sin it'll save you
[1:25:10] we're saved by grace through faith that
[1:25:12] not of yourselves is the gift of god
[1:25:13] gotta have faith without faith it's
[1:25:15] impossible to please him
[1:25:19] amen
[1:25:20] amen
[1:25:23] it's what picks you up
[1:25:25] my there are so many
[1:25:27] things that are weights and that are
[1:25:29] heavy
[1:25:30] but the first thing that we have to have
[1:25:32] is that
[1:25:35] faith in our lives now notice
[1:25:40] now ultimately
[1:25:43] so we're not here after 9.
[1:25:46] what this eagle what papa eagle
[1:25:50] is trying to get across to us
[1:25:53] eaglets
[1:25:54] is that we
[1:25:57] are made out of the same material
[1:26:02] and we believe that
[1:26:04] that you are made out of the same
[1:26:06] material that got it
[1:26:09] whatever jesus was you're made out of
[1:26:12] the same material
[1:26:14] this just comes fresh to my mind better
[1:26:16] bam talks about you know
[1:26:17] if you want to have everything that's in
[1:26:20] the ocean go get a tablespoon full or a
[1:26:24] cup
[1:26:25] of the water right out of the ocean and
[1:26:28] every thing that's in that ocean and
[1:26:30] that water is in that cup
[1:26:33] that's the way it is with you and i when
[1:26:35] we have the holy ghost everything that
[1:26:37] god has now we possess
[1:26:44] and god's whole ambition is that there
[1:26:46] may be
[1:26:47] many sons of god in the image of god are
[1:26:50] you with me
[1:26:52] because somebody believes we're taking a
[1:26:53] flight one of these days
[1:26:55] we are taking a real flight right out of
[1:26:57] this world
[1:27:00] but before we get to there we have to
[1:27:02] lighten up
[1:27:05] we have to set aside all the weight all
[1:27:07] the doubt
[1:27:09] in our eyes on the right thing
[1:27:12] look up begin to focus on the right
[1:27:15] thing
[1:27:17] oh my
[1:27:21] praise be to god god is so good i am so
[1:27:24] glad
[1:27:26] i mean
[1:27:27] he wishes everybody why can't everybody
[1:27:30] realize that if they just look to god
[1:27:32] they can have joy
[1:27:34] they don't have to have sorrow they
[1:27:36] don't have to be depressed
[1:27:40] you don't have to be depressed
[1:27:43] it's heavy it's terrible to be down in
[1:27:45] the
[1:27:46] in the dumps
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:27:49] to terrible the place to be
[1:27:52] but joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:27:57] i got to listen to some of that
[1:27:59] good gospel music
[1:28:02] i got the dancing on my deck
[1:28:04] my wife walked out on me and disturbed
[1:28:06] my dance for the lord
[1:28:10] but i thought you know i just get
[1:28:11] carried away it's just
[1:28:13] god is good
[1:28:15] amen i don't care if nobody sees you
[1:28:17] somebody does nobody has to see you you
[1:28:19] out there by yourself that's a good time
[1:28:21] to think about the lord
[1:28:23] amen
[1:28:30] praise the lord
[1:28:32] so you look at it just to look at him
[1:28:35] and to see the power
[1:28:38] that he has
[1:28:40] how many we all know that god don't have
[1:28:42] any doubt
[1:28:44] right
[1:28:45] there's no unbelief in god
[1:28:48] what did jesus say to himself which one
[1:28:50] of you who can accuse me
[1:28:52] of unbelief
[1:28:54] ah you can't accuse him of unbelief he's
[1:28:56] got nothing but faith
[1:29:00] faith picks you up it gives you strength
[1:29:02] it gives you what overcoming power
[1:29:08] and so does love
[1:29:10] that right
[1:29:11] now abide in faith hope and love and the
[1:29:13] greatest of these is
[1:29:15] charity
[1:29:16] right
[1:29:18] how many believes we need to overcome
[1:29:22] this is about
[1:29:26] coming up
[1:29:28] above
[1:29:29] like jesus said there like the bible
[1:29:31] says there in ephesians he is far above
[1:29:36] all principality and power
[1:29:39] above it all
[1:29:42] so tonight
[1:29:43] just think about this
[1:29:45] what is it that you're not above
[1:29:52] what is it that always gets you
[1:29:56] what gets you down
[1:30:00] because remember he said he had put
[1:30:02] everything under
[1:30:03] his
[1:30:04] feet everything is under christ's feet
[1:30:08] one of the things that i really love
[1:30:10] that my mother-in-law used to tell me
[1:30:13] and there was a quote that brother
[1:30:14] manning made says something about if
[1:30:16] you're nothing if you are a part of the
[1:30:18] body of christ and you're nothing but
[1:30:20] the skin under your foot under the heel
[1:30:23] that's all you are it's just that skin
[1:30:27] guess what every devil is still under
[1:30:29] you
[1:30:32] amen every devil is still under you it's
[1:30:38] under your feet
[1:30:41] amen
[1:30:45] oh my
[1:30:48] so if you have faith
[1:30:52] hebrews says that
[1:30:55] through faith we understand that the
[1:30:57] worlds
[1:30:58] were framed
[1:31:00] by the word of god so that things which
[1:31:02] are seen were not made of things which
[1:31:04] do appear
[1:31:06] so we know the whole world was framed
[1:31:08] together by the word of god can we say
[1:31:11] this afternoon those little eaglets
[1:31:14] whether they'd ever be able to fly or
[1:31:16] not
[1:31:17] isn't that right
[1:31:18] those little eagles their whole world
[1:31:21] your whole world centers around
[1:31:25] whether or not you have faith
[1:31:29] and you
[1:31:30] create
[1:31:31] your own world
[1:31:33] i mean please we create
[1:31:35] our own world you live where you live
[1:31:38] now with your address because you chose
[1:31:40] to do that
[1:31:42] isn't that right i live in lewisburg
[1:31:44] some of you live in uh lacrosse some of
[1:31:47] them in elkton whatever it might be
[1:31:48] clarksville hello
[1:31:52] you live in an apartment you live in
[1:31:53] that well it's whatever you chose
[1:31:57] you create your world
[1:32:00] you let this father you're always
[1:32:02] bothered by this oh that's not god
[1:32:05] that's you
[1:32:07] the whole world gets framed together
[1:32:09] that's eagle great top of god's his
[1:32:11] whole world is framed together by faith
[1:32:15] amen
[1:32:20] lord help me to live in a
[1:32:22] world in the realm of faith
[1:32:27] oh my how many knows
[1:32:29] it doesn't matter how much weight you
[1:32:31] have faith gets rid of the weight
[1:32:35] that's the only way to get rid of the
[1:32:37] weight is through faith
[1:32:40] oh my
[1:32:42] praise god
[1:32:44] and then the love of god comes in our
[1:32:46] hearts
[1:32:48] everything centered around those babies
[1:32:50] god cares about those eaglets every part
[1:32:53] of them everything about those eagles
[1:32:58] oh my
[1:32:59] i can just see that eagle now
[1:33:02] i can see that eagle in front of the
[1:33:04] nest way up in the top of a cliff
[1:33:06] mountain somewhere and she's about 20
[1:33:09] feet away from the nest
[1:33:11] and she's out there just hovering
[1:33:14] she's not flopping
[1:33:16] she's just hovering just sitting there
[1:33:19] and looking over at the eagles
[1:33:21] the babies the babies are looking over
[1:33:24] at her and saying
[1:33:25] wow look at mama
[1:33:27] she don't flop she's just sitting out
[1:33:29] there in the middle of the air that's
[1:33:31] got to be so cool
[1:33:33] huh
[1:33:35] but as she is there sometimes perhaps
[1:33:38] she twitches her uh wing this way or her
[1:33:40] tail feathers they'll go a little this
[1:33:43] way a little that way did you ever watch
[1:33:44] the bird near
[1:33:46] that the tail will go a little bit this
[1:33:48] way it'll go a little bit that way it's
[1:33:49] constantly adjusting in the wind
[1:33:54] amen because it's the wind that's
[1:33:56] holding them up
[1:34:00] praise the lord
[1:34:03] let me tell you something what how many
[1:34:05] knows that the winds represent trials in
[1:34:08] our life
[1:34:10] that's what they represent trials in our
[1:34:13] life were meant to push us higher in god
[1:34:21] think about it
[1:34:22] every winter trial that comes your way
[1:34:25] met and she's there teaching them look
[1:34:27] this is what you do with wind you make
[1:34:29] it work to your favorite
[1:34:32] adjust your feathers whenever a wind
[1:34:34] comes whenever trials come you better
[1:34:36] adjust a little bit you better get down
[1:34:37] on your knees and say god i want to have
[1:34:40] a bad attitude but i know i shouldn't
[1:34:42] lord help me to help the right attitude
[1:34:44] and just a little bit of distraught and
[1:34:45] guess what
[1:34:47] it don't even bother me
[1:34:49] all it does is bring me closer to god
[1:34:53] i commit it to him
[1:34:55] i get closer to god by
[1:34:57] praise the lord
[1:35:02] and don't let your hair start graying
[1:35:05] before you learn these things
[1:35:08] because a lot of us
[1:35:10] including me
[1:35:11] get hard-headed sometimes
[1:35:19] amen
[1:35:22] but anyway
[1:35:23] to learn to fly
[1:35:25] things that come your way to trust god
[1:35:29] commit it to him
[1:35:30] and use it to let it use you to bring
[1:35:32] you closer to god
[1:35:34] praise god
[1:35:40] my
[1:35:42] let it lift you hard and you know
[1:35:46] sometimes the mama she'll go to flopping
[1:35:48] them wings and so forth
[1:35:51] she'll bring a wind
[1:35:53] into the nest
[1:35:55] and get rid of a lot of loose feathers
[1:35:57] not right
[1:35:59] a lot of loose feathers i understand
[1:36:01] there's rabbit skins and everything else
[1:36:03] that they are when their babies are born
[1:36:05] but eventually
[1:36:06] it's made out of briars under that those
[1:36:09] briars hold those skins in place and a
[1:36:11] few layers comfortable take all of that
[1:36:13] out everything sticker sticker sticker
[1:36:15] sticker sticker
[1:36:18] folks you may have a wonderful holy
[1:36:19] ghost new birth experience and then all
[1:36:21] of a sudden all these things go wrong or
[1:36:23] go wrong go wrong
[1:36:24] we'll find out whether you're eager or
[1:36:26] not
[1:36:27] isn't that right
[1:36:29] because guess what it's time to leave
[1:36:31] the comfort zone god didn't mean for
[1:36:33] them little eagles so stay in there i'm
[1:36:35] not going to bring you your food all the
[1:36:37] time

[1:36:48] gonna bring your food all the time
[1:36:51] you have to get the food yourself you
[1:36:53] need your own revelation from god
[1:36:57] you need your own experiences and
[1:36:59] revelations from god if you're ever
[1:37:01] going to amount to being a good eaglet
[1:37:07] amen
[1:37:09] you have to learn
[1:37:10] to get it yourself amen
[1:37:12] oh my learn how to pray yourself how to
[1:37:15] read your bible seek god
[1:37:20] how many believes that so that's faith
[1:37:21] that's the strength of faith
[1:37:23] is to frame and form
[1:37:26] your
[1:37:27] world
[1:37:29] whether you're going to be heavy and
[1:37:30] weighted down or whether you're going to
[1:37:32] be able to
[1:37:33] soar in the heavens
[1:37:39] that sweet peace
[1:37:41] amen
[1:37:42] some people have no rest
[1:37:45] but god gives us peace don't he
[1:37:51] that one evil was down one time remember
[1:37:54] he found an eagle in the woods and he
[1:37:55] was down
[1:37:57] all the way on the ground
[1:37:59] and there was a chipmunk just chattering
[1:38:01] chattering chattering chattering
[1:38:03] i really hate that william when you're
[1:38:06] sitting up in that tree in a and a
[1:38:08] squirrel or a chipmunk bust yeah and
[1:38:12] they just sit there and they just
[1:38:14] chatter and shatter and shatter and
[1:38:17] you're like shut up i'm trying to hunt
[1:38:19] here
[1:38:21] but says he's warning everybody there's
[1:38:24] danger there
[1:38:25] you're gonna draw everybody's attention
[1:38:28] well that little thing was chattering
[1:38:30] because it knew that
[1:38:32] if that thing could fly right it would
[1:38:33] probably be schmorgasborough for the
[1:38:36] eagle
[1:38:38] but the eagle had gotten wet had gotten
[1:38:41] down from the storm from the wind hey
[1:38:44] and folks how many ever been there
[1:38:46] get down from the wind god from down
[1:38:48] from the storm and let me tell you
[1:38:50] something only because it's an eagle and
[1:38:53] has those light feathers does that make
[1:38:55] it it don't make a bit of difference to
[1:38:58] the groundhog or any of those woods
[1:39:00] creatures whether it rained or not
[1:39:02] they're just fine
[1:39:04] right
[1:39:05] but not an eagle it has to get in the
[1:39:07] sunshine hello and it has to spread out
[1:39:10] those wings in the right and it has to
[1:39:13] let that sun dry those feathers
[1:39:17] because if you know it'd be like trying
[1:39:19] to watch a chicken fly with completely
[1:39:21] soaking wet
[1:39:22] i don't know if you ever saw it but they
[1:39:24] don't get very far they only get as high
[1:39:26] as their feet can jump off the ground
[1:39:28] and that's about it
[1:39:30] they're wet they can't do nothing but
[1:39:32] now you let that get dry
[1:39:34] you let it get good and dry and those
[1:39:36] feathers all of a sudden
[1:39:38] they come in their place where they're
[1:39:40] supposed to be again
[1:39:42] and then
[1:39:43] there's all that water is off of them
[1:39:45] the weight is off of them they're
[1:39:47] lighter
[1:39:49] it's back in normal
[1:39:51] whew think about it
[1:39:53] get in the presence of prayer right
[1:39:55] get into prayer and bask in the presence
[1:39:58] of god
[1:39:59] just pass there a while
[1:40:02] come unto me he says you know
[1:40:04] let us reason together saith the lord
[1:40:07] don't your sins be a scarlet they shall
[1:40:10] be white as snow
[1:40:11] go talk to the lord about it one time
[1:40:15] amen
[1:40:19] oh brother branham he was
[1:40:21] rejoicing i guess and having a shout in
[1:40:23] time when he saw this and
[1:40:25] he began to look at that and he says i
[1:40:26] could get my gun and i could shoot you
[1:40:29] aren't you scared he wasn't a bit afraid
[1:40:32] huh i mean that's how christians are you
[1:40:33] don't have to be afraid when you're in
[1:40:35] the lord

[1:40:39] we was on the way to church tonight
[1:40:41] all of a sudden donna's phone goes

[1:40:59] he'll be all right
[1:41:01] or it was just one of those amber alerts
[1:41:02] but i still have to think you know one
[1:41:04] of these days probably everybody'll be
[1:41:05] getting that

[1:41:22] that he says there's a missile named
[1:41:23] right there

[1:41:27] these things coming over

[1:41:59] can bust that bomb
[1:42:02] amen no fear that he had no fear
[1:42:06] he says and after a while when he got
[1:42:08] tired of the chatter chatter and fussing
[1:42:11] and stew and fighting and bickering and
[1:42:14] complaining and murmuring and everything
[1:42:16] else of that earth-bound creatures
[1:42:18] huh

[1:42:54] higher all right
