[10:21] reading a little book here not long
[10:24] ago that on some kind of a a research
[10:29] and in this research I found something
[10:31] most startling. I sat down and I laid
[10:35] the book down and raised up my hands and
[10:37] praised God. Got up and walked around a
[10:39] little bit and sat down and read it
[10:40] again. I thought, "Oh, is that so?" that
[10:44] on this same
[10:46] hill where Jesus was crucified, Adam
[10:50] died and was buried on the same hill
[10:53] that Jesus died on and was buried on the
[10:56] same hill where Adam died. He died at on
[11:00] Goltha and was buried on Golgatha. Now I
[11:04] thought what appropriate whether it was
[11:06] right or wrong, let's say it was right.
[11:08] Then the first Adam died and was buried
[11:13] and buried yet in the dust. Amen.
[11:16] Because he represented the world and the
[11:19] people to sin. But the second Adam being
[11:22] the God of heaven. Amen. When he died on
[11:25] cross there wasn't enough earth to hold
[11:27] him there. He rose on the third day and
[11:30] is alive forever more. Hallelujah.
[11:33] But the sin problem was settled.
[11:36] God settled the sin problem there at
[11:40] Calvary. That's where the debt was paid.
[11:43] When this Adam, second Adam, died, he
[11:48] paid the debt of sin for the human race
[11:51] and the world put him in a tomb and
[11:55] sealed him up in that tomb. And they do
[11:59] the same today. They're trying to do the
[12:02] same today.
[12:05] I don't want you to miss this. The world
[12:07] is trying and will get worse all the
[12:10] time to seal Christ back in a tomb
[12:13] again.
[12:15] They're trying to make him a historical
[12:17] god. One that walked in days and give
[12:20] power to disciples to heal the sick and
[12:23] to cast out devils. But what did they
[12:26] do? As soon as they thought they had got
[12:28] rid of him, just like Cain did when they
[12:31] thought he got rid of Abel, they sealed
[12:34] him in a tomb and put him in there. And
[12:38] today they're trying to keep Christ in a
[12:40] tomb.
[12:42] But oh, what an Easter morning does. An
[12:46] Easter morning ruined all of our
[12:49] theology.
[12:51] And when an Easter morning came for a
[12:53] people, a church here, 1900 years later,
[12:56] it ruled their theology.
[12:59] Praise the Lord. He's not dead. He's
[13:02] alive forever more.
[13:04] They cannot keep him in no tomb. You can
[13:07] put him in a Methodist tomb or a Baptist
[13:09] tomb or a Presbyterian tomb or whatever
[13:12] you want to, but he raised out of that
[13:14] tomb. It is alive today. Hallelujah.
[13:18] Jesus. I had a Baptist tomb and you
[13:20] might have had a Methodist tomb. But one
[13:22] day Jesus rolls from there from a
[13:24] historical god to a living present alive
[13:28] forever more.
[13:30] Hallelujah.
[13:32] Something taking place on that Easter
[13:35] morning. It was a seal, a satisfied
[13:38] seal.
[13:40] When they took him and put him in the
[13:42] tomb and put a Roman seal up on top of
[13:45] it. But when that hour arose, when that
[13:49] hour comes, he stayed there for a while.
[13:52] It's true. He stayed there for those
[13:55] three days and nights. But on that set
[13:58] time, which the scripture said, Amen.
[14:01] Hallelujah. Glory. On the time when he
[14:05] said, "Destroy this body and on the
[14:07] third day I'll rise it up." Amen.
[14:10] And there's nothing can stop that
[14:12] scripture. It's got to come back.
[14:15] Oh, hallelujah. And that seal was
[14:17] broken. Glory. And he rose up. The same
[14:21] Jesus died again forever more.
[14:23] Hallelujah. And for some 1900 years, or
[14:26] maybe I'll say 14 or 1500 years, the
[14:30] churches has had him sealed away. But he
[14:32] said, "It shall come to pass in the last
[14:34] days.
[14:36] There's nothing going to stop there be
[14:39] light in the evening time." Amen.
[14:42] [Applause]
[14:43] The works that I do shall you also,
[14:46] it shall be light in the evening.
[14:50] I don't care how many seals you try to
[14:52] put over it. God will break every seal.
[14:55] All right. He broke the seal of the
[14:57] tomb. He broke the seal of hell. He
[15:00] broke the seal of death. He broke the
[15:02] seal of the grave and arose forever
[15:05] more over the grave, death, hell, tombs
[15:09] and every man thing there was to show
[15:11] that he was God and could not be sealed
[15:14] away from the people anymore.
[15:17] God forever more.
[15:20] Nothing could hold him. The grave
[15:22] couldn't be dug deep enough. Hell
[15:24] couldn't be hot enough.
[15:27] Oh, nothing could hold him.
[15:29] He broke every seal with Easter seal
[15:31] that he was sealed with. And he said,
[15:34] "The same seal that I wear, you shall
[15:36] wear also." For the and this seal that I
[15:40] wear, it shall do the same things. When
[15:43] you're sealed, for he
[15:45] that works I do shall he do also. Even
[15:49] greater than this shall he do, for I go
[15:51] unto the father. How are you going to
[15:53] keep it down? What are you going What
[15:56] can people do about it? You might you're
[15:59] forced to the decision to make your
[16:01] decision what to do about it. That's
[16:03] exactly right. Now we find that he no
[16:08] seal could hold him. He come forth. God
[16:10] broke the seal. The seal of the tomb
[16:14] broke the seal of death. Broke the seal
[16:16] of hell. Broke the seal of the grave and
[16:19] came forth triumph. What did it? That
[16:23] great seal that was on the inside of me.
[16:25] They could destroy the body, but they
[16:28] could never destroy that seal. God gave
[16:31] the church a seal and that can never be
[16:34] destroyed. One destroyed Abel, he raised
[16:38] up faith. When he destroyed one prophet,
[16:40] they raised up another, they kept
[16:42] destroying. But God gave them something
[16:44] that they cannot destroy. It's a
[16:46] supernatural spirit. It's a Holy Ghost
[16:49] itself. That is infallible.
[16:53] It's imperishable.
[16:55] It cannot be destroyed.
[16:58] It'll live on and on and on. And because
[17:01] he lives, we live with him because we're
[17:04] sealed into the body of the Lord Jesus
[17:07] Christ. Hallelujah. No way. No way to
[17:12] ever be destroyed, cannot perish, but
[17:15] has eternal life. Amen. God's great
[17:19] ripping of
[17:24] begin to lose its hold. His feet begin
[17:26] to rise. Earth begin to peep through.
[17:28] Beyond
[17:29] that, I will come again, he said, and
[17:33] receive you into myself that where I am,
[17:36] there you may be
[17:37] also. I'm so glad that I can sing that
[17:41] song with a true heart tonight. Living,
[17:44] he loved me. Dying, he saved me. Buried,
[17:48] he carried my sins far away. rising he
[17:53] justified freely
[17:55] forever. Sunday is coming. Oh glorious
[17:59] day.
[18:02] Was reading a little book here not long
[18:04] ago.
[18:14] Morning brothers and sisters.
[18:17] How many of you can say it's good to be
[18:19] a Christian this morning?
[18:23] can say thank you Jesus for all you've
[18:25] done for
[18:26] us. If it wasn't for what happened back
[18:29] then, if it wasn't for Easter morning,
[18:31] none of us would be here this morning.
[18:33] We sure do appreciate that. Maybe
[18:36] brother Brad will open us in prayer this
[18:39] morning. Amen. Certainly good to see
[18:43] everyone looking bright and beautiful
[18:44] this morning on this Easter morning and
[18:46] thankful for what God's done for us. So,
[18:48] let's just go before the Lord in prayer.
[18:50] Heavenly Father, we come before you this
[18:52] morning and celebrating this time of a
[18:54] resurrected savior. And we're thankful
[18:57] this morning, Lord, that you forgive us
[18:59] of where we failed you and where our
[19:02] faults and shortcomings are. And it's by
[19:04] that empty tomb this morning. And Lord,
[19:07] I was thinking and this morning just
[19:09] praying, thankful for the empty tomb.
[19:12] And because of that empty tomb this
[19:13] morning, we can have fullness of life.
[19:15] We can have fullness of healing and
[19:17] fullness of deliverance. And because of
[19:19] an empty tomb, we have a fullness of
[19:22] eternal life, Lord. And we thank you for
[19:24] it, Lord. We just want to take a time
[19:26] today just to lift you up and honor you
[19:29] and just to bring glory to your name
[19:31] this morning as we worship you in spirit
[19:33] and truth. And we ask Lord this morning
[19:35] that you would just we invite you in a
[19:37] special way to come and anoint our
[19:39] pastor this morning that he would speak
[19:41] the words of life to us and that we
[19:44] would just gain liberty to serve you in
[19:46] a greater way. We ask that you be with
[19:48] each musician, the songs sang, and the
[19:50] lessons to be taught and the words read.
[19:53] Lord, we just give you honor, praise,
[19:55] and glory and dedicate this time to you
[19:57] to move in a mighty way. May you find
[19:58] your way up and down the aisles and not
[20:01] only into the aisles, but into the
[20:02] hearts of your people this morning. We
[20:04] love you, Lord, and thank you for all
[20:06] you do in Jesus name. Amen.
[20:11] Children can be dismissed for Sunday
[20:12] school. And if we'll go in the
[20:14] scripture, we're going to go uh I
[20:17] usually I like to read Isaiah 53, but it
[20:20] was on the slideshow there. And I think
[20:23] sometimes maybe uh we're going to go to
[20:26] we're going to go to uh Matthew chapter
[20:30] 28. I think sometimes maybe could wear
[20:34] that scripture out, but one thing about
[20:36] God's word is it doesn't wear out. It's
[20:39] just as good today as it was when it was
[20:42] put on paper. And it's just as good
[20:43] today as when it happened on the on the
[20:46] shores of
[20:47] Galilee. So let's go to Matthew
[20:54] 28. We'll just read that whole chapter
[20:57] there. In in the end of the Sabbath and
[21:00] as it began to dawn toward the first day
[21:03] of the week came Mary Magdalene and the
[21:05] other Mary to see the
[21:09] sepicure.
[21:17] His countenance was like
[21:20] lightning, and his raignment white as
[21:22] snow.
[21:29] And the angel answered and said unto the
[21:31] women, "Fear not, ye, for I know that
[21:34] you seek Jesus, which was crucified.
[21:44] Go quickly and tell his disciples that
[21:46] he is risen from the dead. Behold, he
[21:48] goeth before you into Galilee. There
[21:51] shall you see him. Lo, I have told you.
[22:02] And as they went to tell his disciples,
[22:04] behold, Jesus met them, saying, "All
[22:06] hail." And they came and held him by his
[22:09] feet and worshiped him.
[22:20] Now when they were going, behold, some
[22:22] of the watch came into the city, and
[22:24] showed unto the chief priest all the
[22:26] things that were done,
[22:36] saying, Say ye, his disciples came by
[22:38] night, and stole him away while he
[22:40] slept.
[22:47] So they took the money and did as they
[22:49] were taught. And this saying is commonly
[22:51] reported among the Jews unto this
[23:00] day. When they saw him, they worshiped
[23:02] him, but some doubted.
[23:11] Go, go ye therefore and teach all
[23:14] nations, baptizing them in the name of
[23:16] the Father and the Son and the Holy
[23:17] Ghost, teaching them to observe all
[23:20] things whatsoever I have commanded you.
[23:23] And lo, I am with you always, even unto
[23:26] the end of the world. Amen. God bless
[23:28] you. May be seated, Brother
[23:32] Brian. Even unto the end of the world.
[23:34] And I believe we're here this morning at
[23:36] the end of the world.
[23:39] He's still with us.
[23:43] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[23:48] So, you know, how do you top that when
[23:51] brother Brandham was speaking before you
[23:53] come up and teach Sunday school? You've
[23:55] always heard me say before, I'm just a
[23:58] man. I can't play scripture. All I can
[24:00] tell you is what the revealed messenger
[24:02] of the hour has said and what God's word
[24:04] says. You know, I don't have my own
[24:06] personal opinion or my own idea in
[24:09] it. I'm not I was about to say I'm not
[24:12] going to say it, but if you would turn
[24:13] with me, I don't I'm not going to be up
[24:15] here very long this morning, but I was,
[24:18] you know, they showing the anniversaries
[24:21] up there and brother David and brother
[24:24] Janet's was in 1981 in April and I was
[24:27] just thinking, you know, I'm not trying
[24:30] to be funny here. Some people weren't
[24:32] even here in 1981. some people, you
[24:35] know, were here in 1981. And I was
[24:37] thinking, you know, 1981 was a good year
[24:40] for me because it was really when God
[24:44] started dealing with me as a young man
[24:47] and, you know, that's a long time ago,
[24:50] but he finally got a hold of my heart.
[24:53] Did Did I not have struggles and
[24:56] tribulations the last 43 years? No, that
[24:58] would be I couldn't say that. But it was
[25:01] in that same year that God showed me and
[25:04] revealed to me this message of the hour.
[25:06] And it was a good year for me. And I was
[25:08] just thinking, you know, a lot of people
[25:10] say everything old becomes new or
[25:12] everything new becomes old. And I was
[25:14] just thinking, if you think of the
[25:16] summer, you can't, but the year of 1981
[25:19] is no different than the year of 2025.
[25:22] Politically, it was the same way as it
[25:25] is. Everything it was no different than
[25:27] it is today. I mean, some of you c young
[25:30] couples wouldn't have wanted to live in
[25:32] 1981 because when you go to the bank and
[25:35] they want to make you spend 12% for a
[25:37] mortgage loan, you wouldn't be happy.
[25:39] See, everything changes. But I remember
[25:41] that October where God got a hold of me
[25:44] in a barracks room in Germany and
[25:46] finally revealed to me the word of the
[25:49] Lord. And I was just saying it if any of
[25:51] you been on active duty, you I when you
[25:54] when you finally give your heart to
[25:56] Jesus Christ and want to walk that path,
[25:58] all the you some people understand what
[26:01] I'm about to say, your whole life
[26:03] changes that time. Everyone and it's the
[26:06] same. It's no different as a civilian.
[26:08] Once you give your heart to the Lord and
[26:11] you totally sell out to Jesus Christ,
[26:14] even your own family sometimes will walk
[26:16] away from you and you the your friends
[26:19] will walk away. People that you loved
[26:21] and cared about, they fight against you.
[26:24] They resist with you, but in the end,
[26:26] God's love takes a hold of you and
[26:28] you're able to put up with those things
[26:30] because you know God has done something
[26:32] for you. But I'll just read not wanting
[26:35] to I said that and I'm still up here.
[26:37] But uh I was going to read in uh if you
[26:40] turn to second Corinthians the fifth
[26:42] chapter and if you think of all the
[26:44] things that Christ did for us on this
[26:46] Easter day, what Paul had to say in this
[26:49] fifth chapter is what the very purpose
[26:51] was to bring about what Paul said here
[26:54] in the fifth chapter of second
[26:56] Corinthians. And I'll sit down after I
[26:59] read this, but it's really true for us
[27:01] this morning. And this is what we all
[27:03] look for in our hearts. And it says,
[27:06] "For we know that if our earthly house
[27:08] of this tabernacle were
[27:11] dissolved. We have a building of God, a
[27:14] house not made with hands, eternal in
[27:16] the heavens." So we're that's really a
[27:19] comforting thought this morning.
[27:20] Wherever you're at, in the beginning of
[27:22] your life or at the end of your life,
[27:25] that one scripture is a comforting thing
[27:27] to reach out and to hold on to. For in
[27:30] this we grown earnestly, desiring to be
[27:32] clothed upon with our house, which is
[27:35] from heaven. So that's my desire is to
[27:38] take that form one day, to reach out and
[27:41] take that form. So be it that being
[27:43] clothed, we shall not be found naked.
[27:46] For we are we that are in this
[27:50] tabernacle do grown being burdened not
[27:53] for that we would be unclothed but
[27:55] called upon that mortality might be
[27:57] swallowed up of life. Now he that hath
[28:01] wrought us the selfsame thing as God who
[28:04] hath given us the earnest of the spirit
[28:06] which I hope all of us have this
[28:08] morning. Therefore, we are always
[28:10] confident knowing that whilst we are at
[28:13] home in the body, we are absent from the
[28:15] Lord. And he goes on to say, herefore,
[28:18] we walk by faith, not by sight. And
[28:21] that's really true. You know, it goes to
[28:22] what brother Brandon was saying. The
[28:24] world that we live in right now is
[28:26] trying to put everything about the true
[28:30] cross and true Christianity is trying to
[28:32] wrap it up in the tomb again, trying to
[28:34] do away with the power of God this
[28:36] morning. And it goes on, I lost my place
[28:39] this morning. And for we walk by faith,
[28:41] not by sight. We are confident, I say,
[28:43] willing rather to be absent from the
[28:46] body to be present with the Lord.
[28:48] Wherefore we labor that we whether be
[28:50] present or absent, we may be accepted by
[28:54] him. And that's my desire this morning.
[28:56] I want to be accepted by him this
[28:58] morning. I want to be able to walk those
[29:00] streets of gold, as they say. And the
[29:02] only way you get there, and I'll just
[29:04] finish with this thought, goes to what
[29:06] brother Brandham was saying this
[29:08] morning. The only way you can get there,
[29:10] you know, it's really funny. The hardest
[29:12] thing about being a Christian is being
[29:15] willing to let go. You have to let go of
[29:17] everything that you ever hold on to in
[29:20] your life and just let go and let God
[29:22] have his way this morning, Brother
[29:24] David.
[29:30] Amen. Can you love the Lord this
[29:31] morning?
[29:33] Amen. He sure has been good to us,
[29:36] hasn't
[29:37] he? Amen. He woke us up this morning and
[29:41] gave us a sound mind and and most of
[29:44] all, he saved our
[29:47] soul. What more could a person ask for
[29:50] this morning than what God's done for
[29:52] us? Let's stand this morning and if we
[29:54] could. And it's just good to be in the
[29:56] house of the Lord this morning. And
[29:58] Amen. And I thought as brother Brad
[30:00] prayed and this little course was on my
[30:02] heart this morning. The tomb now is
[30:05] empty. The stone is rolled away and
[30:09] Christ is alive where in my heart this
[30:15] morning. And

[39:42] we just appreciate them being here this
[39:44] morning. and and uh it's good to have
[39:48] brother Estavon and Sister Tracy with us
[39:50] this morning and brother Steve I I
[39:52] finally he told me what that meant. So
[39:55] I'm horrible with names, but I've always
[39:57] stuck with that. I can remember that.
[39:59] It's good to have them here this
[40:00] morning. God bless you and we just
[40:02] appreciate them being here. And uh

[40:33] he? And you know, I was thinking of what
[40:35] Brother Brian talked about when the Lord
[40:37] dealt with him in 1981. And I thought,
[40:40] you know, and I was raised in a good
[40:43] Christian home and I guess if as the old
[40:46] saying goes, I was the black sheep of
[40:47] our family. And but you know, when I
[40:50] tried many times to serve the Lord, but
[40:53] there just wasn't no anchor there. And
[40:55] and then after I graduated high
[40:57] graduated high school about little after
[40:59] 1980, the Lord really dealt with my
[41:01] heart and I just couldn't go on anymore
[41:04] without him. And I'm just so glad. and
[41:06] and uh I tried to date my wife before I
[41:08] became a Christian and she said I was
[41:10] crazy and she wasn't dating no sinner.
[41:12] So, but but the Lord helped me out. He
[41:15] saved my soul and I got a wonderful wife
[41:17] of 44 years this month and I'm thankful
[41:19] for that this morning and Amen. God's
[41:22] just been good to us all and Amen. And I
[41:24] I thought, you know, as I was praying

[41:31] singing this song. And He Lives. Amen.
[41:34] And it says, "I serve a risen
[41:37] savior." Amen. He's in the world today.
[41:40] Say, "Where's he at?" Just turn around,
[41:41] look at your neighbor. If you want to
[41:43] see him this
[41:44] morning, you know, that might stumble
[41:47] some people, but we know where he lives.

[41:52] in our hearts this morning? Amen. I'm
[41:55] glad he lives, aren't you, this morning?

[58:51] Amen. Amen.
[58:55] Who would take my cross to
[58:58] Calvary? Pay the price for all my

[59:10] Jesus.

[1:02:03] morning, Brother Thomas. And Amen. Let's
[1:02:05] sing that chorus as Brother Thomas
[1:02:07] comes. God is good all the time. He puts
[1:02:10] a song of sadness in my heart. No. puts
[1:02:13] a song of praise in this heart of mine.

[1:02:48] time. Oh, if you're
[1:02:51] walking oh through the
[1:02:55] valley, oh, there are

[1:03:54] good. Oh, he's so
[1:03:57] good all the
[1:04:02] time. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:04:06] Praise your name, Lord.
[1:04:09] Amen. Good morning.
[1:04:11] A good Easter morning to everybody.
[1:04:14] Amen. I trust everybody's happy. Amen.
[1:04:18] On this Easter morning. Amen. Praise the
[1:04:21] Lord. It's certainly a special day,
[1:04:23] isn't it? Amen. To believe that our Lord
[1:04:26] Jesus rose rose this morning. Amen.
[1:04:28] Before daylight, early in the morning, I
[1:04:30] think it was Mary went to the separ,
[1:04:32] right? And he wasn't there. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:36] Praise the Lord. Probably God said we're
[1:04:38] the only religion in the world. Amen.
[1:04:41] Whose founder and leader Amen. whose
[1:04:44] grave is empty. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:47] His grave is
[1:04:49] empty.
[1:04:52] Amen. Amen. People might like like it,
[1:04:55] but it's the only true religion there
[1:04:57] is. All the rest are false. Only the
[1:05:03] gospel of Jesus Christ, Amen, is the
[1:05:06] true gospel. Thank you, musicians. Amen.
[1:05:08] Praise the Lord. So this morning, we
[1:05:10] want to with the help of the Lord try to
[1:05:12] express, Amen. our gratitude to the Lord
[1:05:14] for what he's done. And I guess you've
[1:05:16] put the title up there. We want to speak
[1:05:18] on Amen. what Easter means to us. Amen.
[1:05:23] How many knows that uh it it that's what
[1:05:26] really matters is what it means to you.
[1:05:29] Amen.
[1:05:30] Praise the Lord. So we want to try to
[1:05:32] express that with the help of the Lord.
[1:05:34] Let's just bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we
[1:05:36] thank you Lord, Father, that because of
[1:05:39] Easter, it also already means, Father,
[1:05:42] that when we come before you and pray,
[1:05:44] Lord, our desires and our voice and our
[1:05:48] words can be heard, Lord. For you said,
[1:05:51] "Ask and it shall be given unto you,
[1:05:53] Lord." Father, and we thank you so much
[1:05:56] for this day, Lord. busiest probably the
[1:05:59] greatest day, the greatest holiday that
[1:06:01] we observe and that we celebrate that is
[1:06:04] your resurrection Lord Father and we
[1:06:08] look forward for another resurrection
[1:06:10] Lord Jesus another Easter that lays
[1:06:12] ahead of us Father for we know that
[1:06:15] Easter will produce another Easter and
[1:06:19] for that we wait and for that we long
[1:06:21] for that we look for and that's for you
[1:06:23] to come again Lord Jesus from the clouds
[1:06:25] of heaven to call Father the trump of
[1:06:28] God to sound and call all the dead
[1:06:30] saints of all the ages out of the
[1:06:33] graves, their bodies to be changed in
[1:06:36] the atoms. And Lord Jesus to for you to
[1:06:39] redeem your people and to come and to
[1:06:41] claim that purchased possession, Father,
[1:06:44] of what you did, Lord, through the last
[1:06:46] 2,000 years. Lord, we would ask, God,
[1:06:49] that you would just help us and give us
[1:06:50] strength, get us out of the way, Lord
[1:06:52] Jesus, that you might just use your
[1:06:54] gift, Father, that you've given to the
[1:06:55] church this morning, Lord Jesus, to
[1:06:57] speak to your people, the words of life,
[1:06:59] Lord Jesus, and what you once said,
[1:07:02] Lord. keep me from saying one word,
[1:07:03] Father, of myself, Lord, but just that I
[1:07:06] might be surrendered to you and that you
[1:07:08] might speak to your people this morning
[1:07:09] what you have for us. We ask the Holy
[1:07:12] Spirit to come in a special way and even
[1:07:14] as you did to those on the road to
[1:07:16] Emmas, Lord, we know that Father, if
[1:07:18] you'll come and do something you did
[1:07:20] before, Lord, they'll recognize that who
[1:07:22] you really are, Father. We thank you,
[1:07:24] Lord Jesus, for that. That our hearts
[1:07:26] truly have seen this. We may we go from
[1:07:29] the building this morning saying, "Did
[1:07:31] not our hearts burn within us as the
[1:07:33] Holy Spirit spoke to my heart?" But we
[1:07:36] ask these blessings now in Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Amen.
[1:07:41] Just kind of praying I was that the Lord
[1:07:43] will Amen. I think Brother Troy was
[1:07:46] saying a lot of times we uh read
[1:07:48] scriptures over and over and over and
[1:07:50] over again and it can kind of become a
[1:07:51] tradition to us. Isn't that right? And
[1:07:53] we don't want that and it never loses
[1:07:55] its value, never gets old. But we always
[1:07:58] ask God for something fresh, something
[1:08:00] Amen. Something for the hour. Amen. And
[1:08:02] so I I thought that it was quite
[1:08:06] peculiar. Amen. Because I know Tommy
[1:08:08] called me or texted me and asked me if
[1:08:10] he could uh maybe have a little have
[1:08:13] brother Brandham speak for about uh for
[1:08:16] about seven minutes or so before the
[1:08:18] service. And I said, "Yeah, that'll be
[1:08:20] fine because I know if Brother Tommy's
[1:08:22] got something, it's going to be pretty
[1:08:24] good." Amen. So anyway, and so I was
[1:08:27] back there and trying to put in my last
[1:08:29] few minutes of study and and so brother
[1:08:32] Brandon began to preach, but I was kind
[1:08:34] of focused on this on what I was doing,
[1:08:37] not really listening. And but then uh I
[1:08:40] realized that he was uh be he was saying
[1:08:44] the same things that I a tape that I had
[1:08:46] listened to the true Easter Seal that he
[1:08:49] was saying something. Amen. That I've
[1:08:50] got a quote for and that I had already,
[1:08:53] you know, underlined. Amen. So I says,
[1:08:55] "Well, wow." He didn't know that and I
[1:08:57] didn't know what he was going to have or
[1:08:59] whatever. But the quote went like this.
[1:09:01] It says, "And today we're trying to keep
[1:09:03] Christ in a tomb." But oh, what a Easter
[1:09:06] morning done. And Easter morning ruined
[1:09:08] all of their theology. Amen. And when
[1:09:11] the Easter morning came for a people, a
[1:09:13] church here, 1900 years later, it ruined
[1:09:17] their theology. He's not dead. He's
[1:09:20] alive forever more.
[1:09:22] They cannot keep him in no tomb. They
[1:09:24] can They can put him in a Methodist
[1:09:26] tomb, a Baptist tomb, a Presbyterian
[1:09:29] tomb. I'm going to say an Amish tomb, a
[1:09:31] Menanite tomb.
[1:09:34] Amen. Amen. He says, listen, but he
[1:09:37] says, a Presbyterian or whatever you
[1:09:39] want, but he raised out of that tomb and
[1:09:41] he is alive today. And I had, he says, I
[1:09:44] had a Baptist tomb. You might have had a
[1:09:46] Methodist tomb, but one day Jesus rose
[1:09:48] from there from a historical God to a
[1:09:51] living God, a present God, alive forever
[1:09:54] more. How many's glad to be serving a
[1:09:57] living God? Thank you,
[1:10:00] Jesus.
[1:10:02] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, I
[1:10:05] says, "Wow." Well, that's just the order
[1:10:06] of the spirit. Isn't that right? Just
[1:10:08] the order of the spirit. So, we believe
[1:10:10] that. Oh my. I want to just say it
[1:10:12] again. How many believes that just to
[1:10:14] believe that you're in God's group,
[1:10:17] God's church. Amen. We're part of the
[1:10:19] body of Jesus Christ. If it wasn't for
[1:10:21] that, I don't know what we'd do. Amen.
[1:10:24] We'd still be in darkness somewhere, but
[1:10:26] we don't have to be in darkness anymore.
[1:10:28] Amen. So, I just have kind of a
[1:10:30] different scripture that I want to go
[1:10:32] to. Amen. I think brother Troy read the
[1:10:34] the resurrection scripture already. And
[1:10:36] so, we'll go to um let me see here.
[1:10:39] Let's go to Luke 7. Luke 7.
[1:11:03] Luke
[1:11:04] 7:31. Okay, I'm on 8 something. That's
[1:11:07] what the problem is. All right.
[1:11:11] I was like, "Boy, I sure have wrote it
[1:11:13] down wrong, haven't I?" Okay. In Luke
[1:11:17] 7:31, and I think we'll go back up to
[1:11:19] verse 29 for just a minute. And all the
[1:11:21] people that heard him and the publicans
[1:11:23] justified God, being baptized with the
[1:11:25] baptism of John, but the Pharisees and
[1:11:28] lawyers rejected the council of God
[1:11:30] against themselves, not being baptized
[1:11:33] of him. And the Lord said, "Where unto
[1:11:38] then shall I liken the men of this
[1:11:41] generation?" Amen. In other words, what
[1:11:44] are we going to compare it
[1:11:46] with?
[1:11:48] Amen. What it's like, so to speak, what
[1:11:51] is this generation like? What is an
[1:11:54] example that I can give of this
[1:11:57] generation? All right. And what are they
[1:12:00] like? They are like unto the children
[1:12:02] sitting in the marketplace, calling one
[1:12:04] to another, and saying, We have piped
[1:12:07] unto you, but you have not
[1:12:10] danced.
[1:12:12] Amen. We have mourned unto you, and ye
[1:12:15] have not wept. Amen. For John the
[1:12:19] Baptist came neither eating bread nor
[1:12:21] drinking wine. And you say, "He has a
[1:12:23] devil." In other words, they rejected
[1:12:26] him. Ain't that right? They rejected
[1:12:29] him. The son of man comes eating and
[1:12:31] drinking. And ye say, "Behold, he's a
[1:12:33] glutton man and a wine bibber, a friend
[1:12:35] of publican sinners. But wisdom is
[1:12:38] justified of her children." May God add
[1:12:40] his blessings to the reading of the
[1:12:42] word. You can have your seats this
[1:12:43] morning. Amen. Praise the
[1:12:48] Lord. How many's glad to be a
[1:12:51] beneficiary of Easter?
[1:12:53] There's two kinds of people. Amen.
[1:12:57] and and and the meaning of
[1:13:00] Easter for some people Easter don't mean
[1:13:03] hardly anything at all. Ain't that
[1:13:06] right? And I think it was last year
[1:13:09] perhaps that even our president just uh
[1:13:12] pretty much tried to make Easter about
[1:13:14] Easter bunnies and
[1:13:16] transgenders. Ain't that right? Get made
[1:13:19] a transgender holiday right at Easter.
[1:13:22] Now, I read up on it and they say that
[1:13:24] it's not right on Easter, but uh March
[1:13:26] the 30th or something very, very close.
[1:13:28] And it was a real mockery. Ain't that
[1:13:30] right?
[1:13:32] Amen. And so today we find that there's
[1:13:35] so many different people think so much
[1:13:37] different things about Easter. But the
[1:13:40] reality of it is it isn't about chicken
[1:13:42] eggs. Is that right? Or chickens or
[1:13:45] anything like that like brother Benham
[1:13:47] said. But it's about the resurrection of
[1:13:49] Jesus Christ.
[1:13:51] Amen. Now, I don't know what I'll if
[1:13:54] I'll do this yet or not, but I thought
[1:13:56] about maybe getting a microphone and
[1:13:58] having a little bit of a testimony and
[1:13:59] find out just what some of y'all what
[1:14:02] Easter means to
[1:14:04] you. Hello. What does Easter mean to
[1:14:08] you?
[1:14:11] Amen. Well, I got to starting to write
[1:14:14] down stuff and I'm telling you what,
[1:14:15] when you think about what Easter means
[1:14:17] to you, we can be here a while. Isn't
[1:14:20] that right? We could be here a while and
[1:14:23] that's okay. We can we can be here a
[1:14:25] while if we want to be. Isn't that nice?
[1:14:27] We can be here as long as we want to be.
[1:14:30] We can stay as long we want. Praise the
[1:14:32] Lord. But the scene here is that Jesus
[1:14:36] was saying it's like, you know, people
[1:14:39] play music and oh my, such good
[1:14:43] music, but the people just
[1:14:54] In other words, it's not reciprocated is
[1:14:56] what Jesus was saying.
[1:14:58] Ain't that right? It's not reciprocated.
[1:15:00] He used another example when he talked
[1:15:02] about a supper that he made, right? He
[1:15:05] made a great supper and he had
[1:15:07] everything. Behold, everything's ready.
[1:15:09] Go out and invite my people. Go invite
[1:15:11] my
[1:15:12] relatives. Go invite my friends. And he
[1:15:15] went out there, invited everybody. And
[1:15:17] they had a horse and a mule and a and a
[1:15:19] donkey. I guess they had to break and
[1:15:21] train and prove. And they had some land
[1:15:23] they had bought and had married a woman,
[1:15:26] a wife or whatever. And they were just
[1:15:28] too busy. They just was busy with other
[1:15:30] things. Amen. Amen. Isn't that the
[1:15:34] problem is what with the world today?
[1:15:37] Because we realize that Easter Amen. It
[1:15:41] is the most important story of all of
[1:15:45] humanity. Amen.
[1:15:50] I I listen to World War II a lot and the
[1:15:52] Nazis and all of that and how that you
[1:15:54] know they would go into into Russia and
[1:15:57] they would wipe out the entire city.
[1:15:59] Everybody died. Hello. They wipe them
[1:16:03] out.
[1:16:03] Genocide. And then when they got
[1:16:05] defeated on the way out, they did like
[1:16:07] that too. He says scorched
[1:16:10] earth. And the German people after they
[1:16:12] were defeated and people were coming
[1:16:14] down to the dead death, they would make
[1:16:15] the statement they just don't know what
[1:16:17] life is
[1:16:19] about. They just question what was life
[1:16:21] really all
[1:16:24] about? It's like it has no
[1:16:27] meaning to them. It probably doesn't
[1:16:29] because it sure didn't have much of
[1:16:31] meaning. But you and I this morning,
[1:16:33] aren't you glad to know this morning
[1:16:35] what life is all about?
[1:16:38] It's not just about living and eating
[1:16:41] and having clothes and having food and
[1:16:43] having houses to live in. Jesus said,
[1:16:45] "Isn't the life more than the meat?"
[1:16:47] Quit worrying about the meat so much.
[1:16:49] Thinking about the life
[1:16:53] more life is more than what the the
[1:16:56] natural things are. It's about your
[1:16:58] life.
[1:17:04] Amen.
[1:17:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:11] So one of the first things I want to
[1:17:14] say and that
[1:17:18] is that Jesus
[1:17:21] come this life ain't that
[1:17:26] right John 10 I believe it
[1:17:32] is John 10 said the thief cometh not but
[1:17:36] to kill to steal and to
[1:17:40] destroy. But I am come that you might
[1:17:43] have life.
[1:17:46] That's what it means to me. He came so
[1:17:49] that you would have
[1:17:51] life. Now I mean know that look at
[1:17:54] everybody. Everybody's alive is
[1:17:56] alive. They might say they got life.
[1:18:02] But remember, Brother Brandon went into
[1:18:03] that hotel room and there was I guess it
[1:18:06] sounded like the way that he made it
[1:18:07] sound. It was religious people having
[1:18:08] some kind of
[1:18:10] convention. They were having a
[1:18:12] convention and they had priests and
[1:18:13] everything and they said during the
[1:18:14] night he'd go through the elevator. He
[1:18:16] went through the elevator, women half
[1:18:18] dressed and everything else going up and
[1:18:20] down the halls falling and and all kinds
[1:18:22] of wickedness, you know, that was going
[1:18:24] on.
[1:18:26] kicking their heels up, drinking and
[1:18:28] drunking and saying, "This is life."
[1:18:32] Brother Brandon couldn't stand it
[1:18:34] anymore. He went over there and grabbed
[1:18:36] one of the women by the hand. He said,
[1:18:38] "No, it's not. It's death.
[1:18:40] This is not life. This is death."
[1:18:44] It made him sick because the next
[1:18:45] morning the different ones were going
[1:18:47] down there and the priest was praying
[1:18:49] for him and all of that under that
[1:18:52] debauchery. Hello.
[1:18:55] What a sickening. What's what kind of a
[1:18:57] sick Christianity that it was.
[1:19:00] This is
[1:19:02] life. Let me tell you how many know that
[1:19:05] if the first life is all you have, you
[1:19:07] don't have much of a life.
[1:19:10] Why? Because the Bible says in Galatians
[1:19:12] there talk about the fruits of the
[1:19:14] flesh. Amen. And the life that it is a
[1:19:16] lasciviousness and idolatry and and all
[1:19:19] kinds of things. drunkenness and
[1:19:21] revelings and murderers and hatred and
[1:19:23] variance and emulation. That first
[1:19:25] nature, it ain't much of a life.
[1:19:30] Amen. Many will actually put a gun to
[1:19:32] their head because it's a that is not
[1:19:34] life. It's not worth living. It's
[1:19:36] miserable.
[1:19:38] It can become miserable.
[1:19:43] Amen.
[1:19:45] That's not
[1:19:46] life. Amen. For those people that get
[1:19:48] drunk and they think they have a good
[1:19:50] time. I've been there, done that. And I
[1:19:52] realize the next morning, I don't care
[1:19:54] what you've done, who you've slept with,
[1:19:56] or where you've been. The next morning,
[1:19:58] you go and you are as empty as empty can
[1:20:01] be.
[1:20:03] You are full of sin and you have to go
[1:20:05] take another drink. Amen. Just to try to
[1:20:08] make you fel better. Amen. But B says,
[1:20:10] man, you take a cigarette, you got to
[1:20:12] smoke another one, you drink them. Got
[1:20:14] to drink more to try to cover that up.
[1:20:15] and you just multiply your anguish.
[1:20:20] It's not a life. And I don't know about
[1:20:23] you, but I wasn't made to be and have a
[1:20:25] empty emptiness in there. Other people
[1:20:28] might be satisfied with that, but I'm
[1:20:30] not satisfied with the empty heart.
[1:20:33] Amen. That void in my heart. Amen. I
[1:20:35] want God to fill
[1:20:39] that. I wasn't made for that. That's why
[1:20:42] it was never satisfying to me. That's
[1:20:44] why there's something in there that
[1:20:45] said, "God, there's got to be something
[1:20:47] more than party and that kind of life
[1:20:50] cuz it's a miserable thing."
[1:20:54] And Jesus come to give you life. And he
[1:20:56] said, "And that more abundantly." How
[1:20:59] many would say this morning, I want
[1:21:01] life, and I want it more
[1:21:06] abundantly. He came to give us more
[1:21:08] abundant life.
[1:21:14] Amen. Thankful for that, aren't you?
[1:21:32] Because what does life consist of?
[1:21:36] Happiness,
[1:21:38] joy,
[1:21:40] peace. Isn't that right?
[1:21:45] Comforts. What is life if you're not
[1:21:47] comfortable? If you're
[1:21:49] miserable. What is life if you have no
[1:21:52] peace in your heart?
[1:21:56] No peace,
[1:21:58] anguish,
[1:22:00] distress,
[1:22:03] fear,
[1:22:05] condemnation. That's not life.
[1:22:09] Everybody
[1:22:10] struggles and they think that maybe by
[1:22:12] possessing more they'll have more
[1:22:15] comfort. They'll have more
[1:22:18] joy. Amen.
[1:22:21] But remember the angels came and when
[1:22:23] they when when Jesus came to earth they
[1:22:26] those angels they brought him tidings of
[1:22:29] comfort and joy.
[1:22:32] Peace on earth and good will to men.
[1:22:35] Christ was coming to bring us peace to
[1:22:38] give us what really life is all about.
[1:22:44] He came to give us justification. He
[1:22:47] gave peace. He come to give us peace.
[1:22:51] Amen. To give his
[1:22:54] life and that more abundantly.
[1:23:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:02] Amen. I hope I get to it, but I want to
[1:23:04] talk about the everyday application of
[1:23:07] what Easter means for us on a daily
[1:23:10] basis.
[1:23:14] Oh my, I'm glad it's not just on Sunday
[1:23:16] and Wednesday that we can have a good
[1:23:18] time in the Lord that we can fellowship
[1:23:21] in the spirit that we can be in heavenly
[1:23:23] places in Christ Jesus.
[1:23:29] Do you realize that we all realize that
[1:23:31] you are sitting in the best place that
[1:23:34] you can ever sit in in this universe?
[1:23:38] You're sitting amongst believers in
[1:23:40] heavenly places in Christ
[1:23:43] Jesus. That's what church ought to be.
[1:23:46] It ought to place that you love to go
[1:23:48] to. Amen. That you love to come to and
[1:23:50] that you can fellowship around the word
[1:23:52] of God.
[1:23:55] Amen.
[1:23:57] There ain't a bar out there. There ain't
[1:23:59] a nightclub out there that's even close
[1:24:01] to compared with the peace and the
[1:24:03] greatness of the heavenly places that
[1:24:05] you're in.
[1:24:07] That place is darkness. That place is
[1:24:10] death.
[1:24:15] Amen. Praise the
[1:24:19] Lord.
[1:24:22] This
[1:24:25] this is life.
[1:24:29] Now some might
[1:24:31] say, "Yeah, this is life.
[1:24:36] Are you going to believe that?
[1:24:39] You're going to question. You're going
[1:24:41] to question
[1:24:42] [Music]
[1:24:44] that. Oh
[1:24:47] my. Praise the
[1:24:51] Lord.
[1:24:53] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:57] You know, one thing
[1:25:00] is almost unparalleled, of course,
[1:25:04] comfort, peace, and joy. Isn't that
[1:25:07] right? In the Holy Ghost. That's what I
[1:25:09] really think is
[1:25:12] life. Remember I said in the Holy Ghost
[1:25:14] because the Holy Ghost is Jesus. And he
[1:25:16] that hath the Son hath life. He that
[1:25:18] hath not the Son hath not life.
[1:25:22] Amen.
[1:25:27] And it's quite something how that when
[1:25:29] Jesus kept talking about having to be
[1:25:31] crucified and going and be betrayed.
[1:25:33] Ain't that
[1:25:35] right? Even
[1:25:38] Peter had so should we say such a lack
[1:25:41] of
[1:25:42] revelation. Peter had such a lack of
[1:25:44] revelation that ain't no way they were
[1:25:46] going to take him. Is that right?
[1:25:49] He drew his sword begin to cut some
[1:25:51] heads off. Try to
[1:25:54] I really highly doubt he aim for the
[1:26:00] year. That's
[1:26:02] right. But he kept saying it, you know,
[1:26:05] I got to go
[1:26:07] away. Now, how many knows that
[1:26:10] even even um and this has to do with
[1:26:13] humanity and how how that sometimes God
[1:26:15] doesn't tell us everything. You have to
[1:26:17] have some faith.
[1:26:20] But even the disciples after Jesus was
[1:26:23] risen and different ones came and told
[1:26:25] him, "Neither believe they them." Ain't
[1:26:27] that right? You heard a lot of that.
[1:26:30] Neither believe they them. Neither
[1:26:32] believe they them. And when Jesus came
[1:26:34] back and talked to him, he says, "Oh,
[1:26:36] slow of heart, oh fools, and slow of
[1:26:39] heart to believe all that the prophets
[1:26:41] have spoken.
[1:26:44] You're so slow to believe that all of
[1:26:46] the prophets have spoken.
[1:26:50] Amen. You would have thought that
[1:26:52] somehow Jesus could have made it very
[1:26:53] clear, and he probably did, but they
[1:26:56] just didn't catch it, of exactly how
[1:26:58] this is going to go
[1:27:00] down. He said, "I will be betrayed of
[1:27:03] the Jews and so forth and, you know,
[1:27:05] destroyed his temple in three
[1:27:07] days." But maybe the disciples and
[1:27:10] everybody had a different idea of it.
[1:27:13] But he was speaking to him to him. He
[1:27:15] said, "These things have I spoken unto
[1:27:17] you that ye should not be
[1:27:20] offended." And then down in
[1:27:23] verse five, it says is in chapter 16 of
[1:27:26] John. But now I go my way to him that
[1:27:29] sent me and none of you askst me whether
[1:27:32] goest thou? But because I have said
[1:27:34] these things unto you, sorrow has filled
[1:27:37] your
[1:27:38] heart. Sorrow has filled your heart. In
[1:27:41] other words, he talk like that, they'd
[1:27:43] all get sad.
[1:27:46] Nevertheless, I tell you the truth, it's
[1:27:49] expedient that I go away.
[1:27:55] It's
[1:27:56] necessary that I go
[1:27:59] away. Amen. For if I go not away, the
[1:28:04] comforter will not come unto you.
[1:28:08] I mean that was the Old Testament
[1:28:09] saints. They had the
[1:28:12] word, they had the mechanics, but they
[1:28:15] didn't have the dynamics.
[1:28:17] You see, history is about the dynamics.
[1:28:21] How many believes that's right? It is
[1:28:23] the rising of the sun. But the Ram
[1:28:24] talked about that Cadillac. You can have
[1:28:27] it ever so plush. You can have
[1:28:28] everything just right. It can have a
[1:28:31] full tank of gas.
[1:28:35] But if it doesn't have that spark,
[1:28:38] it might as well be a pile of rubble.
[1:28:43] Amen.
[1:28:45] And he was trying to tell him, "It's
[1:28:47] expedient. It's necessary that I go
[1:28:50] away. It's necessary that I die."
[1:28:56] Like the Pope says that Jesus's death
[1:28:58] was a humanly speaking a failure. Then
[1:29:01] why in the world did Jesus tell Pharaoh
[1:29:03] uh Herod? He says, you know, don't you
[1:29:06] realize I have the power to release you
[1:29:07] or to kill
[1:29:09] you? And he said, don't you realize this
[1:29:12] is why I
[1:29:15] came? This is why I came. This was the
[1:29:17] purpose of my coming. He said,
[1:29:20] I came so I could
[1:29:22] die. I came to pay the price. My purpose
[1:29:26] is to die.
[1:29:31] Oh my. Living, he loved me. Dying, he
[1:29:34] saved me. Buried, he carried my sins far
[1:29:36] away. Rising, he justified freely
[1:29:39] forever. And oh glorious. What a
[1:29:41] glorious day. One day he's coming. Oh,
[1:29:44] glorious day. That's right. One of these
[1:29:46] days, he's coming to redeem his
[1:29:48] purchased possession.
[1:29:52] Amen.
[1:29:55] I want to say what a resurrection that
[1:29:57] was.
[1:29:59] the greatest of all the times of
[1:30:02] everything. But I hope I don't overstep
[1:30:05] my bounds. But I want to say there's a
[1:30:06] greater time coming.
[1:30:09] There's a greater resurrection coming.
[1:30:12] Why? Because that resurrection was so
[1:30:15] that you could have a resurrection and
[1:30:17] we could rise and meet him in the air.
[1:30:20] He did that so we could all come
[1:30:22] together.
[1:30:25] One of these days, the purpose of
[1:30:26] Calvary and the resurrection will be
[1:30:28] fulfilled when we meet him in disguise.
[1:30:30] And it could happen before this service
[1:30:33] is over. How many's looking for that
[1:30:35] hour? Looking for that resurrection.
[1:30:39] Woo!
[1:30:42] I don't know about you, sometimes I look
[1:30:43] at them sunsets, I look them great
[1:30:45] clouds, and I say, "God, one of these
[1:30:47] days I'm going to see you coming from
[1:30:48] the clouds of heaven."
[1:30:53] Living, he loved me. living. He made
[1:30:54] some promises that he would send the
[1:30:57] comforter, but those were
[1:31:01] promises. We want to talk about the
[1:31:02] life, the death, and the resurrection of
[1:31:05] Jesus. In life, he made promises. I got
[1:31:08] to go away so that I can send you the
[1:31:12] comforter. How many is glad for the
[1:31:14] comforter?
[1:31:16] How many is comfortable?
[1:31:22] Amen.
[1:31:25] comfortable. You can't be comfortable
[1:31:27] without having peace.
[1:31:30] That's right. But when you have peace
[1:31:31] like a river tendeth my way. Amen.
[1:31:36] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1:31:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:43] It is expedient that I go away. For if I
[1:31:45] go another way, the comforter cannot
[1:31:47] come. But if I depart, I will send him
[1:31:50] unto
[1:31:51] you. Amen. Now, we don't want to go into
[1:31:54] a lot of this,
[1:31:57] but I'll just read it a little
[1:32:00] bit. He said there that when he's
[1:32:04] come and when he has come, he will
[1:32:06] reprove the world of sin.
[1:32:09] Amen. Because they believe not. Ain't
[1:32:12] that right? So, when the Holy Ghost
[1:32:14] comes, one thing he'll do, this
[1:32:17] comforter isn't going to stay quiet.
[1:32:22] Do you realize out of if you watch those
[1:32:24] YouTubes of those Christians that go out
[1:32:26] into these trans rallies and all these
[1:32:28] people and they're they're preaching
[1:32:30] with the microphone, some of them get
[1:32:32] hit. People come up there just vicious.
[1:32:34] Them devils get mad. I want you to know
[1:32:38] what are you doing here? You know, oh
[1:32:40] my, they just all mighty get all riled
[1:32:42] up
[1:32:44] telling them about the
[1:32:46] gospel. But what did they do? That Holy
[1:32:49] Spirit is going to reprove the world of
[1:32:51] sin. Jesus died for you. Jesus loves
[1:32:54] you. He wants to save you.
[1:32:59] Nothing but good. And they don't want no
[1:33:00] part of it. That's nothing but
[1:33:04] demons. But he'll reprove the world of
[1:33:06] sin. Just like we read this morning.
[1:33:09] It's like God. Amen. He made some good
[1:33:11] music, but nobody wants to dance.
[1:33:17] Nobody wants to
[1:33:24] reciprocate. You know, I was just
[1:33:26] driving down the road and I was
[1:33:27] thinking, if the Lord went to Calvary
[1:33:30] and did all that he did so that we could
[1:33:32] have fellowship with him
[1:33:35] again, let me just ask you something. Do
[1:33:38] you fellowship with him the way that you
[1:33:40] should?
[1:33:43] I don't think any of us could say,
[1:33:45] "Yeah, I'm right where I should." We
[1:33:47] talk. We We're talk every minute. We're
[1:33:49] We're constantly
[1:33:50] fellowshipping. Huh? The fact is most of
[1:33:54] the time we're going down the road, we
[1:33:55] think about God and all, but we don't
[1:33:56] say, "Hey Lord, I just wanted to say how
[1:33:59] you how you doing? I love you. Thank you
[1:34:02] for riding in the car with me. And and I
[1:34:04] just wanted to talk to you about this
[1:34:05] that or the other." And most time we're
[1:34:07] worried about stuff. But I thought, you
[1:34:09] know, I don't think that our fellowship
[1:34:11] is up where it should be. He did all of
[1:34:13] that. And he he wants to fellowship with
[1:34:15] each and every one of us more than what
[1:34:17] we realize.
[1:34:20] So if we don't do nothing, take nothing
[1:34:22] away from this morning's service, let's
[1:34:23] just realize, say, God, help me to talk
[1:34:26] to you more and listen more. How many
[1:34:29] believe that Jesus is willing to talk to
[1:34:31] us more if we're willing to listen more?
[1:34:35] I truly believe that.
[1:34:40] Amen.
[1:34:43] Amen. All
[1:34:48] right. Again, he says in chapter 14 and
[1:34:51] verse 25, he says, "These things have I
[1:34:53] spoken unto you being yet with
[1:34:56] you." He says, "But the comforter, which
[1:35:00] is the Holy
[1:35:02] Ghost," Amen. Hallelujah. which is the
[1:35:06] Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in
[1:35:08] my name, he will teach you these things,
[1:35:10] and bring all things into your
[1:35:13] remembrance. Whatsoever I have said unto
[1:35:16] you. Peace I leave with you. My peace I
[1:35:20] give unto you, not as the world giveth,
[1:35:22] giveth unto you, let not your hearts be
[1:35:25] troubled, neither let them be afraid.
[1:35:28] How many believe until Jesus rose from
[1:35:30] the dead until this morning? He could
[1:35:33] say whatever he wanted to say. He could
[1:35:35] say it destroy his temple in his few
[1:35:37] days I'll raise it up. It was all
[1:35:39] taught. But brother Ma'am said he just
[1:35:41] when God came in the power of his
[1:35:43] resurrection. Amen. And he rose on
[1:35:45] Easter day. He made all of it true. He
[1:35:49] made all of it right. He made it all
[1:35:52] good. How many believes every word is
[1:35:54] good? He keeps his word. Cuz all those
[1:35:58] promise wouldn't have meant nothing if
[1:36:00] he didn't rise from the dead. But if he
[1:36:03] did raise from the dead, no wonder Peter
[1:36:05] could run to the suppler. Amen. I got to
[1:36:08] see that. I got to know it. I'm excited
[1:36:10] about him being raised. I got to see it
[1:36:13] for myself.
[1:36:21] Maybe a little hard to believe, but when
[1:36:23] you tell them that Jesus once again rose
[1:36:25] again, rose again out of denominational
[1:36:27] systems and dark ages.
[1:36:30] Ain't that right, brother Brenam? I
[1:36:32] rising in the sun. I believe it is he.
[1:36:34] So what a resurrection that was. But
[1:36:35] what a resurrection this is. Jesus comes
[1:36:38] and does the very same things like he
[1:36:41] did in showing himself to Cleopus
[1:36:44] Cleopius and his friend doing the same
[1:36:46] thing there breaking the bread that he
[1:36:49] did before and they recognize that's
[1:36:51] him.
[1:36:52] Amen. Aren't you glad that you recognize
[1:36:54] when the discernment and thoughts and
[1:36:56] intents of the heart, hey, that's him.
[1:36:58] He's arriving well. He's here.
[1:37:02] He's not dead. He's alive.
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:11] does something to you, don't it? Amen.
[1:37:14] Praise the Lord. People are still slow
[1:37:17] of heart to believe that Malachi 4, I'll
[1:37:20] send you Elijah the prophet.
[1:37:23] Even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:37:25] the son of man is revealed.
[1:37:27] Amen.
[1:37:29] Revelations 10:7, Luke 17:30, all these
[1:37:32] people that want to believe, religious
[1:37:34] people.
[1:37:36] the religious world.
[1:37:42] Amen. What a horrible thing it was
[1:37:47] for the scribes and the
[1:37:50] Pharisees,
[1:37:57] Israel, the priest, the high
[1:38:00] priest,
[1:38:02] Kus, the other
[1:38:04] priests, all of them there in Jerusalem.
[1:38:08] They the most religious people crucified
[1:38:11] the most horrible death him there. They
[1:38:15] crucified him. Away with him. Away with
[1:38:19] him. You'd never think that this church
[1:38:22] world would do that, but they did.
[1:38:26] We want Barabus. We want our own
[1:38:29] understanding. We want our own way. When
[1:38:32] Christ came and proved himself
[1:38:36] did greater works than what he did what
[1:38:39] he was on the earth on the earth.
[1:38:41] Brother Bam said he couldn't do greater
[1:38:42] than raising the dead but more
[1:38:46] much more.
[1:38:49] Brother B I'm glad to be a preacher of
[1:38:51] this message.
[1:38:56] My because this is what Jesus does
[1:38:59] today. to my God today.
[1:39:05] Not some day going by.
[1:39:09] Why the Amish would they accept him? The
[1:39:14] Menanite, would they accept him? Do they
[1:39:17] accept him when you say that he came and
[1:39:19] did the very same things he did there?
[1:39:21] He did the very same Messiah
[1:39:24] sign. All the signs and the wonders, you
[1:39:28] have to say like he did to the
[1:39:29] Pharisees. If you can't believe me,
[1:39:31] believe the works. They testify of who I
[1:39:34] am.
[1:39:36] Brother Bam, I can't do this. Brother
[1:39:38] Bam, I love him. You know why? Because
[1:39:41] he could have been some big shot.
[1:39:46] Folks, message preachers that want to be
[1:39:48] a big shot don't have much for.
[1:39:52] Brother Brandham says, "I'm just a
[1:39:53] microphone that God uses.
[1:39:57] Don't call me Reverend so and so and
[1:39:58] bishop so and so.
[1:40:01] Huh?
[1:40:02] What was that woman down in Florida
[1:40:04] said? Well, Reverend Dr. Reverend, how
[1:40:06] are you doing? Just call me brother cuz
[1:40:09] that's all I am. Just a vessel in the
[1:40:11] hands of almighty God that Jesus would
[1:40:14] come and use. How many wants to be like
[1:40:16] that? Lord, I just want you to use me.
[1:40:18] Lord, help me to stay humble.
[1:40:22] Amen.
[1:40:25] Praise the
[1:40:29] Lord. Made promises. Made a lot of
[1:40:32] promises. When the Holy Ghost has come,
[1:40:34] Amen. the comforter which is the Holy
[1:40:37] Ghost.
[1:40:40] Amen. If you love me, keep my
[1:40:42] commandments and I will pray the Father
[1:40:44] and he will give you another comfort
[1:40:46] comforter that ye may that he may abide
[1:40:50] with you until the next time you fail.
[1:40:55] No,
[1:40:57] forever. Even the spirit of truth, whom
[1:40:59] the world cannot receive, because it
[1:41:01] seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but
[1:41:03] ye know him. For he dwelleth with
[1:41:07] you. Praise the Lord. Sorry, guys.
[1:41:11] Sorry, Peter. Sorry, Paul. But he said
[1:41:15] he dwelleth with you. He didn't say in
[1:41:18] you yet. He said he's dwelling with you.
[1:41:21] He says, "And shall be in you." How many
[1:41:26] was Paul and Peter and and all the
[1:41:28] disciples? They were better off after
[1:41:30] Pentecost than they were when he was
[1:41:33] walking with him.
[1:41:36] Pretty strong statement.
[1:41:39] That's right. But guess what? Peter, no
[1:41:41] matter how strong he thought he was, no,
[1:41:44] he could still just couldn't couldn't go
[1:41:46] to Calvary with him. He just couldn't
[1:41:49] say, "Yeah, I'm one of them." No, I'm
[1:41:51] not one of them. I don't I'm not strong
[1:41:53] enough to say, "I'm one of them. I'm not
[1:41:55] ready to die."
[1:41:58] Huh? How many knows after after
[1:42:00] Pentecost and after he got the baptism
[1:42:02] of the Holy Ghost, Amen. I believe they
[1:42:04] were fixing to crucify Peter trying to
[1:42:06] catch him, he left town. He was heading
[1:42:08] out of
[1:42:10] town. And I I I don't remember the story
[1:42:14] just exactly but it was Jesus came to
[1:42:15] him says do you want me to go and die
[1:42:17] again something that extent and Peter
[1:42:20] turned around in that and went back in
[1:42:23] there and he says don't crucify me like
[1:42:27] my Lord don't crucify me like he was I'm
[1:42:30] not
[1:42:31] worthy crucify me upside
[1:42:38] down let's give Peter a
[1:42:44] Amen. That's right. He had humility.
[1:42:48] Ain't no telling what that crucifixion
[1:42:50] was like, but it was no doubt painful
[1:42:52] and hard. But he honored the Lord and he
[1:42:55] had the strength to do it after he got
[1:42:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Why?
[1:42:58] Because Jesus wasn't with him anymore.
[1:43:01] He was in him
[1:43:05] now. Come on, people. Aren't you glad
[1:43:08] he's with you now? I'm glad he's not
[1:43:10] just out there somewhere, but he's
[1:43:12] here. He's here. He's here. Elijah's God
[1:43:17] is in us today. He's here to do whatever
[1:43:20] we
[1:43:22] say. Behold, the bride of Christ in full
[1:43:25] array. He's here. Elijah's God is here.
[1:43:29] [Applause]
[1:43:33] Amen. And how many believes Elijah's God
[1:43:35] is here this morning at evening light
[1:43:37] tabernacle. Not just evening in the
[1:43:39] building, but in your house.
[1:43:42] My house.
[1:43:44] That gives us life.
[1:43:52] Amen. God is good, isn't he?
[1:44:06] Amen. That's right. And shall be in
[1:44:10] you. I will not leave you
[1:44:14] comfortless. I'm going to send my father
[1:44:18] upon
[1:44:20] you.
[1:44:21] No, he says, I will not leave you
[1:44:24] comfortless.
[1:44:25] I will come to you.
[1:44:30] Where is he? Look at one another.
[1:44:34] He's here.
[1:44:36] And every Holy Ghost filled person.
[1:44:39] That's where he is. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:44] Amen.
[1:44:50] How many believe
[1:44:52] Jesus that all the power of heaven and
[1:44:54] earth within him?
[1:44:57] Ain't that right? He said, "I have power
[1:45:00] to lay my life down and I have power to
[1:45:04] raise it back
[1:45:07] up." That's some power. He had power to
[1:45:10] cast out
[1:45:12] devils. Is that right? healed the sick,
[1:45:15] raised Lazarus from the dead after being
[1:45:17] dead four days. He had the
[1:45:21] dynamics.
[1:45:23] Amen. That's what the disciples lacked.
[1:45:26] That's what they needed. A conversion
[1:45:30] in their soul.
[1:45:36] Amen. What does Easter
[1:45:40] mean? I'll tell you what it meant to
[1:45:42] Paul.
[1:45:47] Let me just read what Paul said. What
[1:45:50] things were gained to me those I count
[1:45:53] at loss for Christ. Is that right? How
[1:45:57] many believes Paul was willing to sake
[1:45:59] all to follow
[1:46:01] him? He was going to be the next Capus.
[1:46:04] He was going to be the next high priest.
[1:46:05] He was going climbing the ladder. But he
[1:46:07] said all but dumb. Yay. Doubtless. But I
[1:46:12] cut all things for loss for the
[1:46:14] excellency of the knowledge of Jesus
[1:46:16] Christ my
[1:46:18] Lord. For whom I have suffered the loss
[1:46:21] of all things and do all count them but
[1:46:23] dung that I may win Christ and to be
[1:46:27] found in
[1:46:28] him not having my own righteousness
[1:46:31] self-righteousness. Ain't that
[1:46:33] right? Which is of the law but that
[1:46:36] which is through Christ faith in Christ
[1:46:38] Jesus. the righteousness which is of God
[1:46:40] by faith, that I may know him, and the
[1:46:46] power of his resurrection.
[1:46:51] How many glad to know?
[1:46:54] The
[1:46:55] power that rolled the stone away.
[1:47:00] The power that brought Jesus back from
[1:47:03] the dead.
[1:47:05] You know you have that power.
[1:47:10] How many believe that power is in you?
[1:47:14] That's what Easter means. Knowing him in
[1:47:17] the power
[1:47:19] of what brought him this Easter morning
[1:47:22] that caused that stone to roll away. The
[1:47:24] angels rolled the stone away. Amen. And
[1:47:27] he come walking
[1:47:28] out. Amen. I have power to lay it down.
[1:47:32] I have power to bring it back. That's
[1:47:34] right.
[1:47:35] Amen. And Paul wanted to know that
[1:47:38] power. Another place in 1 Corinthians
[1:47:40] the second chapter, I believe he talks
[1:47:41] about, I didn't come to you in the
[1:47:42] excellency of speech or by wisdom of
[1:47:45] man, but I come to you, Amen. In the
[1:47:48] power of God, so that your faith would
[1:47:49] not rest in the wisdom of man, but that
[1:47:52] your faith would rest in the power of
[1:47:56] God.
[1:47:58] Aren't you glad that you can live a
[1:48:00] daily life
[1:48:02] resting in the power of almighty God
[1:48:08] oh how many know that's why it's so
[1:48:10] important to have prayer in the morning
[1:48:11] Lord what do you want me to do today
[1:48:14] what do you want me to accomplish today
[1:48:16] Lord everything I do walk with me help
[1:48:18] me in everything I do
[1:48:21] man I have testimony after testimony
[1:48:23] after testimony of things that went so
[1:48:25] much better. And I say, "Thank you,
[1:48:27] Lord. I know you're with me. I know
[1:48:30] you're answering that prayer of making
[1:48:32] this come out together the way that it's
[1:48:34] supposed to."
[1:48:36] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] A daily
[1:48:41] application of the resurrection. When
[1:48:44] your children are sick, mom, you get to
[1:48:46] go before the Lord and say, "Lord, touch
[1:48:48] my child. Raise him back up."
[1:48:54] Amen. Amen.
[1:48:58] See there's a whole group. How many
[1:48:59] knows there's a whole group? Because
[1:49:01] most of the time Jesus Christ is
[1:49:04] rejected. Most of the time people don't
[1:49:07] respond to what he did. Most of the
[1:49:09] people don't they are not beneficiaries.
[1:49:12] They are not have not
[1:49:14] benefited from Easter from the
[1:49:17] resurrection. That's right. They receive
[1:49:19] no benefits from it. That's right.
[1:49:22] People don't want it. That's exactly
[1:49:26] right.
[1:49:28] But when I think about the other side
[1:49:30] and remember,
[1:49:32] there was groups there was people that
[1:49:34] did want it. There is people that want
[1:49:37] it.
[1:49:39] If he if there was nobody that wanted
[1:49:41] it, he'd never come.
[1:49:45] I understand he would have come all the
[1:49:47] way from glory and died if it would have
[1:49:49] been for one.
[1:49:51] But I thank the Lord that it's for more
[1:49:54] than one. It's for you. It's for you.
[1:49:57] It's for you. It's for you. It's for
[1:49:59] whosoever will let him come.
[1:50:04] Easter has a message. Whosoever will let
[1:50:07] him come.
[1:50:10] You want life? It's here for you.
[1:50:16] I've provided it for you. Amen.
[1:50:24] Burn, burn, Holy Spirit. Burn in me. Set
[1:50:28] my soul on fire. Fill me with the Holy
[1:50:33] Ghost and God's full desire. Make me
[1:50:37] like the Christ of old, healing and
[1:50:40] raising the dead. Give me the power that
[1:50:44] Jesus had through the blood that was
[1:50:48] shed.
[1:50:51] Amen.
[1:50:52] Hallelujah. Well, let's talk about the
[1:50:55] power a little more, then we'll go into
[1:50:56] his
[1:51:01] death. So, we find that the majority of
[1:51:04] people reject Christ. No matter how many
[1:51:08] great signs and
[1:51:09] wonders, supernatural things, they'd
[1:51:13] rather get out there in a telescope and
[1:51:14] fantasize about something way off and
[1:51:17] find something out there and oh my,
[1:51:19] there must be a God somewhere. Hey, God,
[1:51:20] he's right here. Amen.
[1:51:23] You want to try to find God through the
[1:51:25] science, but when somebody's eyes are
[1:51:27] open, somebody's healed, the dead are
[1:51:29] raised.
[1:51:31] When the discernment goes forth, well,
[1:51:33] that don't mean too much for
[1:51:35] him. You know why? Let me just tell what
[1:51:38] comes to mind. It's because they realize
[1:51:40] that if they really accept it, they're
[1:51:42] going to have to change their ways.
[1:51:45] They're going to have to let God come in
[1:51:46] and take control and make them get rid
[1:51:48] of all their selfishness. They're going
[1:51:50] to have to die to themselves and let God
[1:51:52] come in and rule. They don't want to do
[1:51:54] that.
[1:51:58] St. John says, "He was in the world and
[1:51:59] the world was made by him and the world
[1:52:01] knew him not. He came to his own and his
[1:52:04] own received him
[1:52:06] not." Amen.
[1:52:11] Amen.
[1:52:16] Does anybody know what it says after
[1:52:18] that?
[1:52:22] I got you off keep the
[1:52:25] scriptures and his own received him
[1:52:31] not. But but as many had received him
[1:52:37] gave he the power to become sons and
[1:52:41] daughters of God. How many has received
[1:52:46] him? Hallelujah. You've received him.
[1:52:49] He's given you the power. The power to
[1:52:54] overcome.
[1:52:57] Woo. I'm talking
[1:52:59] power. Wonder working power in the blood
[1:53:03] of the
[1:53:04] lamb. Thank you, Jesus. I'm glad I'm in
[1:53:08] the second
[1:53:09] verse. Not the first one, but the second
[1:53:12] verse. As many as received him.
[1:53:16] He the power
[1:53:18] to become sons and daughters of God.
[1:53:21] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:53:24] Praise the Lord. You love him.
[1:53:31] Amen. See this know also that in the
[1:53:35] last days parallel times will come. For
[1:53:38] men will live be lovers of their own
[1:53:40] selves. Covetous, boasters, proud,
[1:53:43] blasphemers, disobedient appearance,
[1:53:45] unthankful,
[1:53:47] unholy. God does anything. They're not
[1:53:49] thankful for it. He can give you the
[1:53:52] sweetest peace, promise you the sweet
[1:53:54] peace and and forgiveness of your sins.
[1:53:56] And he can give you a a a writing of uh
[1:54:00] a pardon to have all your sins be
[1:54:02] forgiven. Ain't that right? And you just
[1:54:04] unthankful. No reciprocation. That's
[1:54:07] right.
[1:54:09] Without natural affection, truce
[1:54:11] breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
[1:54:14] fierce, despisers of those that are
[1:54:16] good, traitors, heady, high-minded,
[1:54:20] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:54:22] God.
[1:54:24] Amen. As brother Brandham says it,
[1:54:26] churchgoers,
[1:54:28] right? Churchgoers having a form of
[1:54:31] godliness.
[1:54:32] They've got a form of godliness, but
[1:54:34] denying the
[1:54:36] power. How in the world are ever going
[1:54:39] to become sons and daughters without the
[1:54:41] power to overcome all of this? No wonder
[1:54:44] they're still selfish. No wonder they're
[1:54:46] still godless, unthankful, unholy. Why?
[1:54:50] Because they've denied the power. How
[1:54:52] many believe this morning when the power
[1:54:53] comes, Amen, these things go by the
[1:54:55] wayside.
[1:54:58] Your old carnal nature has to die.
[1:55:00] Brother Abraham says, "Die and rot." God
[1:55:03] helping us. He says, "Help our old
[1:55:05] nature to rot
[1:55:07] and let the spirit live in us."
[1:55:10] Amen. They deny the power.
[1:55:14] That's why they're that Cadillac sitting
[1:55:16] there. Oh, they might have plus pews.
[1:55:18] They might have nice churches. They
[1:55:20] might have everything
[1:55:21] else. But they sit there and they say,
[1:55:24] "The days of miracles is
[1:55:26] passed. The Holy Ghost is not for this
[1:55:29] generation.
[1:55:31] Mark 16 from the 20th verse on is not
[1:55:33] even
[1:55:34] inspired. No wonder they can't get
[1:55:36] nowhere. They don't even believe in the
[1:55:39] power of God. They believes in the power
[1:55:42] of God. That's what Easter's about.
[1:55:45] It's about giving you that spark,
[1:55:52] that fire,
[1:55:55] the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:57] When you sing
[1:55:58] amazing grace, it's not doldrum heaven.
[1:56:04] It's Lord,
[1:56:06] amazing grace.
[1:56:09] How sweet the sound that save the rest
[1:56:12] like me.
[1:56:14] Folks, the world, they can have all
[1:56:16] them. People can have all their
[1:56:17] interests and everything they want to.
[1:56:19] I've got my interest. Amen. On the
[1:56:21] greatest thing that there ever
[1:56:23] was, Jesus Christ risen from the dead.
[1:56:28] There is no greater cause. There is no
[1:56:31] greater purpose than to be a son and
[1:56:33] daughter of God. Nothing greater in the
[1:56:39] universe.
[1:56:42] Woo! I'm here to tell you, we might as
[1:56:45] well start shouting and praising God.
[1:56:47] Why? Because Woo! Hallelujah. The may
[1:56:51] world may not dance for him, but I'll
[1:56:53] dance for him. Well, I'll dance for him.
[1:56:58] Glory. Hallelujah. He's worthy to be
[1:57:01] praised.
[1:57:03] He died on Calvary so I could be set
[1:57:05] free. So I'm going to be a little bit
[1:57:07] free.
[1:57:12] You're not going to find me not
[1:57:14] reciprocating. I reciprocate, Lord.
[1:57:17] Thank you, Lord. The more you pour out
[1:57:19] your blessings, the greater I'm going to
[1:57:21] praise you.
[1:57:23] [Applause]
[1:57:28] Hallelujah.
[1:57:32] Praise him in the dance. Praise him with
[1:57:34] the temple. Timal. Praise him with the
[1:57:37] loud timber. Why? He's worthy.
[1:57:39] [Applause]
[1:57:47] He made some good music. How many knows
[1:57:50] God made some music?
[1:57:58] The cross on his back. Blood dripping
[1:58:00] [Music]
[1:58:05] out. It hurts. Oh my hurt. Oh, that's
[1:58:10] some sweet
[1:58:13] music. That's some sweet
[1:58:16] music. Up on Calvary. Amen. They put
[1:58:19] them spikes on
[1:58:22] there. Beating that spike in there.
[1:58:28] Sweet
[1:58:32] music, huh? That's right. Why? Because
[1:58:37] that's why he came. Cuz every pound,
[1:58:41] every stripe on his back was for our
[1:58:44] healing. Healing of our cancers and
[1:58:46] everything else. When the doctor says,
[1:58:48] "Go home. Get your affairs in order like
[1:58:51] he did my wife." I'm here to tell you,
[1:58:52] we have a higher doctor. We have
[1:58:55] somebody that had his stripes put on his
[1:58:57] back and it's sweet music to
[1:59:01] me. Smack, smack,
[1:59:05] smack. It's for my
[1:59:11] healing. That's was for my healing.
[1:59:16] the stakes in his and the spear in his
[1:59:19] side just to make his sure the blood
[1:59:22] came out gushing
[1:59:26] out. Sweet music. Why? Because I was the
[1:59:31] paying the price for every sin of
[1:59:34] everyone. That sounds good to me.
[1:59:39] [Applause]
[1:59:53] Amen. His agony was music for the
[1:59:57] sinner. His
[2:00:00] dying was music for the sinner because
[2:00:03] he was saving.
[2:00:07] He was paying a ransom.
[2:00:12] that if you will believe on him, you'll
[2:00:14] have everlasting life. Not only will you
[2:00:17] live in a hundred billion trillion
[2:00:19] years, you'll have the full joy, that
[2:00:22] comfort that you have now, that peace
[2:00:24] that you have now. That joy that
[2:00:26] sometimes you can't barely contain.
[2:00:28] You'll have it then. He gave all of
[2:00:32] that when he died. when he paid the
[2:00:36] price
[2:00:38] dying. He saved me.
[2:00:43] Amen. I can hear. I can hear it. Can you
[2:00:47] go? That's right. Put him on the pole.
[2:00:51] Set him up and boom. Jerk down into that
[2:00:54] thing. Packed it in. There he was
[2:00:58] moaning, moaning, groaning. Finally
[2:01:02] said, "It is finished. It is finished.
[2:01:10] Amen. The work is done.
[2:01:15] Devil, you made a big mistake.
[2:01:18] You made a huge
[2:01:20] mistake. You just paid for the price you
[2:01:24] took. And you took that blood of that
[2:01:26] son of God.
[2:01:28] He's coming down to you and he's taken
[2:01:31] the keys off of your side of death and
[2:01:34] hell and the grave and he's given it to
[2:01:37] the church and said, "Don't you be
[2:01:39] afraid of nothing anymore. Not even
[2:01:42] death is going to scare
[2:01:48] you. Don't even be afraid of
[2:01:51] death. Be like FS Both. This is my
[2:01:54] coronation date." What are you talking
[2:01:55] about? Who's dying here? me or you play
[2:01:58] me some good music. I've waited for this
[2:02:01] hour. That's the way we heck we can go.
[2:02:03] That's the way you can go if you go.
[2:02:05] See, I've been looking for this. I've
[2:02:06] been waiting for this. This is the
[2:02:08] greatest
[2:02:10] time of my life. He said, greater than
[2:02:13] any meetings is going to be with the
[2:02:16] Lord. Rip the fear out of death. Took
[2:02:19] the stinger out of death.
[2:02:28] That's what Easter means. Means you
[2:02:30] ain't got to be fearful of death
[2:02:32] anymore. He done conquered death, hell
[2:02:35] under the grave. He that liveth and
[2:02:37] believeth on me shall never die. When
[2:02:40] you take that last
[2:02:42] breath and the rest of us go to weeping
[2:02:45] and crying, you're going to be laughing
[2:02:47] and shouting and praising God. You're
[2:02:50] going to be in a place that you couldn't
[2:02:51] even ever have imagined it so good.
[2:02:54] Amen. That's what death is really.
[2:02:57] That's what it really is. Amen. And when
[2:02:59] you're
[2:03:02] there. Amen. Like brother Ivan was lungs
[2:03:07] filling up. The death rattle. The death
[2:03:10] rattle. Death rattle. Breath slowing
[2:03:13] down. Death slowing down. Slowing down.
[2:03:16] Till finally he stops breathing.
[2:03:20] But there's still a few moments, maybe
[2:03:22] 30 seconds or so, in the heart. Same way
[2:03:25] with Joey Hendrickson. Amen. Stop
[2:03:29] breathing, but the heart's still
[2:03:31] beating. But when the heart
[2:03:37] stops, the spirit comes out and goes be
[2:03:41] with the
[2:03:42] Lord. Amen. Never to taste of death
[2:03:45] anymore. Amen. The worst part is dying.
[2:03:49] Amen. But when you take that last
[2:03:52] breath, I'm here to tell you, you're in
[2:03:54] that
[2:03:55] land where you'll never have no death
[2:03:58] rattle again. Never have sickness or
[2:04:00] cancer come. Never have any old age, no
[2:04:03] gray
[2:04:04] hair. Sounds good to me. Amen. God
[2:04:07] promised that. I'll dance to
[2:04:10] that. That's right. Immortal with God
[2:04:14] forever. I'll dance to that. I'll dance
[2:04:17] to that. He's coming to take me home.
[2:04:20] Amen. We which are alive and remain
[2:04:22] shall not prevent them which are asleep.
[2:04:24] For the Lord shall descend from heaven
[2:04:26] with a
[2:04:27] shout. The dead in Christ shall rise
[2:04:30] first. And we which are alive shall meet
[2:04:33] them in the air.
[2:04:36] So shall we ever be with him.
[2:04:41] That's what Easter means to me.
[2:04:55] Brother
[2:04:56] Brad, Brother Steve, come here. I'm
[2:04:59] going to do it a little different this
[2:05:00] Easter. Is that okay? I'm going to stop
[2:05:03] preaching and go around and you just
[2:05:06] think about what Easter means to you and
[2:05:10] give a little short testimony. You want
[2:05:11] to do that? Let's give a little
[2:05:13] testimony to the Lord on this Easter.
[2:05:15] Everybody give everybody a chance to say
[2:05:17] something about the Lord. Who wants to
[2:05:20] say something about the Lord? Donna
[2:05:22] wants
[2:05:23] to Somebody give her the
[2:05:26] mic. Let Donna go first and then we'll
[2:05:28] go Tommy. Y'all just meditate and think
[2:05:32] what's the Lord done for you? What does
[2:05:34] it mean to you? What does this Easter
[2:05:36] mean to you?
[2:05:39] Yeah, you're good.
[2:05:42] Well, I just want to thank the
[2:05:43] Lord that Easter means to me it means
[2:05:46] liberty. It means freedom. It means he's
[2:05:51] in complete control. And that I've
[2:05:54] experienced for myself what it means
[2:05:58] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[2:06:01] today, and forever. And that I've
[2:06:04] experienced that when you have
[2:06:07] him inside of there and it's not a
[2:06:10] religious anointing on the two outer
[2:06:13] realms that things that are impossible
[2:06:18] are not impossible anymore because it's
[2:06:20] God that does it. That's right. Praise
[2:06:24] the Lord. When it's done in here, all
[2:06:26] things are
[2:06:29] possible. Go ahead, brother Tommy. Well,
[2:06:31] when you lived in dark sin like I did,
[2:06:34] lost and broken within and bound up by
[2:06:36] all the drugs and drinking that I did
[2:06:39] and that lifestyle the way I was raised,
[2:06:42] everything just darkness all around me
[2:06:44] when Jesus come on my life and touch my
[2:06:46] life and uh broke my chains of addiction
[2:06:49] set me free and then laid me on my back
[2:06:51] to see where my great blessings come on
[2:06:53] come from when I became a complacent
[2:06:55] Christian just going through the motions
[2:06:57] coming to church living a religious life
[2:06:59] not out running around drinking doing
[2:07:01] all them things. But then when he laid
[2:07:02] me on my back and then healed me when
[2:07:03] the doctors said they I would never be
[2:07:05] healed. I'd never be medication free.
[2:07:07] I'm 100% medication free. Overdone
[2:07:10] everything they ever said I couldn't do.
[2:07:11] The doctors and devils are liars. God
[2:07:13] word still the same yesterday, today,
[2:07:15] and forever. What he's done for me,
[2:07:16] he'll do for you. Set you on fire and
[2:07:18] break all your chains. Amen. What he's
[2:07:20] done for me, he'll do for you. Thank
[2:07:23] you, brother
[2:07:25] Tommy. How many thankful that? What the
[2:07:28] Lord's done for us, he can do for our
[2:07:29] children, he can do for you. Okay,
[2:07:32] somebody else want to give the
[2:07:33] testimony. All right, brother back there
[2:07:35] and also brother
[2:07:39] Troy and turn it up a little bit if you
[2:07:42] can. I want to make sure. My turn. All
[2:07:45] right. Uh, well, Easter for me, uh,
[2:07:48] since I was saved means I can live
[2:07:51] fearfree.
[2:07:53] Uh before I became a Christian, I was a
[2:07:56] religious person but I never had the
[2:07:58] Holy Ghost and I was always afraid of
[2:08:01] hell because I knew that in my condition
[2:08:06] even though I was uh I was a nominal
[2:08:09] Christian which is not a good thing. But
[2:08:12] I always was so afraid of dying because
[2:08:16] I knew in my condition if if I died that
[2:08:20] way I would not be received. But when
[2:08:24] this word came away, that fear of hell,
[2:08:28] that fear of being lost, yeah, left me
[2:08:31] 100%.
[2:08:33] And I I don't have that fear. That fear
[2:08:37] is from Satan. I have God's love in my
[2:08:40] heart. And I know should I die, I don't
[2:08:44] care how, I don't care when. I know the
[2:08:46] Lord will be there to receive me. And
[2:08:49] here a couple years ago, I had a
[2:08:51] terrible car accident where uh when it
[2:08:55] happened, I was thinking I was going to
[2:08:58] die because it was a very severe car
[2:09:01] accident. And one thing I that I came
[2:09:04] away with at that time was when I
[2:09:07] thought I was dying, I had this peace. I
[2:09:11] had this joy in my heart. And I was
[2:09:14] thinking because of the experience, this
[2:09:17] must be it. I must be go. I I I must be
[2:09:21] exiting. I must be going. But I didn't
[2:09:23] have that fear. Praise the Lord. At that
[2:09:26] moment, I had zero fear. I thought,
[2:09:28] well, if this is it, here I come, Lord.
[2:09:32] And well, it was not in his program that
[2:09:35] that I go then, but I still have that no
[2:09:38] fear. And so Easter for me means because
[2:09:41] of the resurrected savior, I can also
[2:09:44] have resurrection life. Amen. Praise be
[2:09:47] to the Lord. Praise the Lord. No fear.
[2:09:49] That's a good
[2:09:50] testimony. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:09:56] Um, Easter means to me that my family is
[2:10:00] sealed. Um, one thing
[2:10:03] recently that it's really become real to
[2:10:07] me that Easter means to me is that I
[2:10:13] don't Bless you, Lord Jesus.
[2:10:16] Hallelujah.
[2:10:24] It's
[2:10:30] okay. I don't have to live in
[2:10:38] fear. All of Jonathan's seizures
[2:10:42] happened during the night.
[2:10:46] And so when I would lay down to sleep,
[2:10:50] Satan would grip me with such
[2:10:54] fear and I couldn't
[2:10:58] sleep and I just stayed so
[2:11:02] exhausted and I knew what God's word
[2:11:05] said and I knew he
[2:11:08] wasn't there's no virtue in worry and I
[2:11:11] knew not to fear but I couldn't
[2:11:14] bring my body under
[2:11:19] subjection. But what this Easter means
[2:11:23] to me is that now I can lay down and
[2:11:26] sleep in peace.
[2:11:29] Yes. Because Jonathan is healed. Amen.
[2:11:33] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:11:35] Glory. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
[2:11:39] Lord. Amen. Sleep in peace.
[2:11:44] Go ahead, brother Troy. Easter to me
[2:11:46] means everything. If, like I said
[2:11:49] before, if it wasn't for Easter, none of
[2:11:51] us would be here. But I thought kind of
[2:11:54] going back to that scripture that David
[2:11:57] spoke of there in Psalms, he said, uh,
[2:11:59] you know, how brother Brennham said it,
[2:12:01] what it's life. Easter is life. Uh, you
[2:12:05] know, he resurrected, it's life. And uh
[2:12:08] how the scripture in Psalms says uh as a
[2:12:10] deer panth for the water brookke so my
[2:12:12] soul longeth after thee thee oh lord
[2:12:15] it's everything to me and and the lord
[2:12:18] has done so much for me he's healed me
[2:12:20] he's he's saved my soul and he has and
[2:12:23] my family and and those promises that we
[2:12:26] hang on to and as brother Tom said there
[2:12:28] you know when Jesus said it is finished
[2:12:30] all those things are finished all those
[2:12:32] things we have need of are finished and
[2:12:34] Lord just give us the faith to receive
[2:12:36] receive receive what you have for us.
[2:12:37] And I am so grateful for what the Lord
[2:12:40] Jesus did for me and my family and all
[2:12:43] of us here actually. Yeah. I'm just
[2:12:45] really appreciative and words cannot
[2:12:48] express what Easter means to me. That's
[2:12:50] right. Amen. How we could go here all
[2:12:54] over this building at the miracles God
[2:12:57] has done. Amen. We thank God for a
[2:13:00] wonderworking God. Amen. Brother Joe, go
[2:13:03] ahead.
[2:13:06] I don't really know where to start,
[2:13:09] but go ahead. Easter means to me that
[2:13:12] I'm sitting here this morning.
[2:13:15] The first thing is when my mom and dad
[2:13:17] got married, they was told they'd never
[2:13:20] have any children. And some of the
[2:13:22] things I'm going to tell you now, you
[2:13:23] know, I don't talk about it much. hadn't
[2:13:26] said much about it, but mom and dad
[2:13:29] would go to brother Brown's meetings,
[2:13:30] and brother Brown prayed
[2:13:33] that they'd have children. Yeah. All
[2:13:35] right. I was the first one to be born.
[2:13:38] All right. Another thing I would say is
[2:13:41] a lot of people, you know, you get your
[2:13:43] babies dedicated. Brother Brandham was
[2:13:45] the one that dedicated me.
[2:13:48] I didn't know that. The another thing
[2:13:50] I've told brother Ber about I never
[2:13:53] talked about a lot. You know a lot of
[2:13:56] things I'll say from this point forward
[2:13:58] apply to a lot of y'all sitting here. So
[2:14:01] what the Lord can do for me he can do
[2:14:04] for you. I can
[2:14:07] remember this week even yesterday we
[2:14:10] talked about it. My family can forgive
[2:14:12] me for how I act, but Hannah even said
[2:14:17] yesterday, but sometimes you don't never
[2:14:19] forget. And I always tell them, well,
[2:14:21] you know, Brother Brandon preached a
[2:14:23] message about me. That's what he
[2:14:24] preached. He preached the meanest man I
[2:14:27] know. So, you know, yesterday we talked
[2:14:31] about that then. U but I can remember
[2:14:35] they was off to a church
[2:14:37] thing. Like I said, a lot of things I'll
[2:14:39] say to now. I know it applied to some in
[2:14:42] here, but I can remember, you know, I
[2:14:45] was brought up in a home and we've been
[2:14:48] seen a lot of different religions. And I
[2:14:50] can remember one night, it was probably
[2:14:52] about 1:30 on a Saturday night, and I've
[2:14:56] always done things to the time I went to
[2:14:59] bed, and that was just a way of life.
[2:15:02] But the next thing was out of all them
[2:15:05] things, I'd still come sit in this
[2:15:07] building right here and sit on a bench.
[2:15:10] So I was just a churchgoer. Then if I
[2:15:12] didn't want to go Wednesday nights is
[2:15:15] always the worst. Well, you got to work.
[2:15:18] Too tired. Just any excuse you want to
[2:15:21] make up. You know, I've done all that.
[2:15:23] Then then on Sundays you go because you
[2:15:26] felt like you had to. But I can remember
[2:15:29] one Saturday night about 1:30 I was
[2:15:31] smoking marijuana and a pillar of fire
[2:15:34] come across. I can still visualize where
[2:15:37] at on lack road. And then when these
[2:15:40] brothers talk about fear, you talk about
[2:15:44] fear, I know what fear is. I knew then
[2:15:47] if I didn't change, I was going straight
[2:15:50] to hell. So the Lord gradually started,
[2:15:53] you know, doing a work in my life. And
[2:15:56] that's why I'd say brothers, sisters,
[2:15:59] every one of y'all this morning, know
[2:16:00] where you're at. This is a day today to
[2:16:04] get your lives right because the Lord's
[2:16:06] not always going to deal with you. He's,
[2:16:08] it's been said, he's obligated to deal
[2:16:10] with you one time. But once you cross
[2:16:13] that line and you refuse, there's
[2:16:15] nothing else that can be done. And
[2:16:17] everybody has a chance this morning to
[2:16:19] make a change and to do to be a better
[2:16:22] husband, right? you know, to if that'd
[2:16:25] be what I'd say since time to man to be
[2:16:28] a better daddy, a better grandpa, to be
[2:16:30] a better witness for our Lord Jesus cuz
[2:16:33] that's what we're put here to do.
[2:16:37] Then, you know, when you look at all
[2:16:39] them things and it's we've always had
[2:16:43] situations and this is what I'd tell you
[2:16:45] about my Lord Jesus this morning, what
[2:16:47] he means to
[2:16:49] me. In the last two
[2:16:51] years, I'd say for three years, we'd
[2:16:54] pray for a scrap yard. A scrapyard. And
[2:16:57] it never would work out where we'd try
[2:16:59] to be. Well, where the Lord put us now,
[2:17:02] we have built a huge scrapyard. We do
[2:17:06] more business than anybody around.
[2:17:08] People may come say it don't look like
[2:17:10] it, but our job is to send semi loads
[2:17:12] after semi loads out every day. And it
[2:17:16] ain't nothing but the grace of God, the
[2:17:18] people, the businesses. Yes, the Lord
[2:17:20] is, you know, give us and we can use it
[2:17:23] for the honor and the glory of the Lord.
[2:17:26] Another thing I'd say also with whom
[2:17:29] much is given, much is required. And
[2:17:32] most of you know it isn't a secret,
[2:17:34] which I try to keep it secret, but
[2:17:36] Hannah puts everybody on her prayer
[2:17:39] list. About two years ago, we got caught
[2:17:41] up in a a situation with the federal
[2:17:44] government on the army base. All right,
[2:17:47] that's federal property. Well, then you
[2:17:50] know around here if you get in trouble,
[2:17:52] the city get you, the county get you,
[2:17:55] the state get you. My problem was the
[2:17:59] feds got me. I had to deal with the FBI.
[2:18:02] I was probably
[2:18:04] facing 200 years never going to get out.
[2:18:08] I mean, never going to get out.
[2:18:11] And you ask, well, how bad was it? We'd
[2:18:14] gotten 21 stolen vehicles. We wasn't
[2:18:17] aware of it. If anybody's ever been on
[2:18:19] that army base and I know brother Brian
[2:18:22] and then brother Sean them, they would
[2:18:24] know out of all the cars we got smashed,
[2:18:27] we smashed a general's hot rod. So, you
[2:18:31] know, so we was definitely in, you know,
[2:18:33] a rough
[2:18:35] situation. But then I just went by what
[2:18:38] the Lord would lead me. I never was
[2:18:40] really concerned. Everybody else was.
[2:18:43] Hannah's devastated. Everybody's
[2:18:45] worried. I'll tell you right now,
[2:18:47] Brother Balor's worried. Everybody had
[2:18:49] fear but me. But I can remember I even
[2:18:53] when I went to court, I just told them
[2:18:56] I'd represent myself. I'm guilty. Do
[2:18:58] whatever you have to do. They said, "You
[2:18:59] can't do that." And then the FBI wind up
[2:19:03] being my friends and my attorneys. They
[2:19:06] told me what to do. So then um then I
[2:19:10] had to get attorney and I wind up Hannah
[2:19:12] found one because they said when I come
[2:19:14] back I have one I didn't realize we was
[2:19:16] getting the best that money could buy.
[2:19:19] Well we got through the situation and
[2:19:22] then they said I had to spend three
[2:19:23] weekends and I think every three
[2:19:25] weekends I go was communion times. So
[2:19:27] I'd be in in the jail and then you know
[2:19:30] I wouldn't be here and it it was
[2:19:33] devastation.
[2:19:35] So the reason why I tell you that to
[2:19:37] tell you what Easter means to me today.
[2:19:40] Bless him, Lord. That's right. I got in
[2:19:45] trouble with the federal government. And
[2:19:47] now I can tell y'all today I work for
[2:19:51] the federal government. So when Brad
[2:19:54] preached a message about Joseph, when
[2:19:56] Joseph got thrown into prison, got out
[2:19:58] and he go back before Pharaoh, I could
[2:20:01] relate to that. And it is this Tuesday
[2:20:04] morning, this coming Tuesday morning, 11
[2:20:06] o'clock, the federal government wants me
[2:20:09] to come to Paduka to the federal
[2:20:10] buildings and then everything they ever
[2:20:13] done, they're going to wipe the slate
[2:20:15] clean. So I'm thankful this morning.
[2:20:18] Yeah,
[2:20:22] [Applause]
[2:20:29] go
[2:20:30] ahead.
[2:20:32] that question about um the Easter, you
[2:20:35] know, I I felt like um if I didn't say
[2:20:37] something, I'll feel backslid after, you
[2:20:40] know, given that opportunity if I
[2:20:42] didn't. But um when I think about the um
[2:20:45] Easter, I think about a resurrection.
[2:20:47] And um in the Bible when
[2:20:50] um when um I think it was Mary um came
[2:20:54] to um Jesus and said, "If you've been
[2:20:57] here, my brother had not died." And she
[2:21:00] he said,
[2:21:01] he shall rise again. And um she said,
[2:21:04] "Yes, Lord, I know in the resurrection
[2:21:06] in in the last days he's rise again."
[2:21:08] And he said pretty much, "What are you
[2:21:10] talking about?" He said, "I am the
[2:21:12] resurrection." Yeah. You know, it's a
[2:21:14] present. And the resurrection was
[2:21:15] standing right in front of her, you
[2:21:17] know. And um so the resurrection is not
[2:21:20] just a an event, it's a person, right?
[2:21:24] And in getting older, um it's an
[2:21:26] encouragement to me to know that one day
[2:21:28] I'll hear the voice of that
[2:21:29] resurrection. Yeah. You know, and I
[2:21:32] won't um remain in the grave. So, that's
[2:21:34] a big encouragement to me when I think
[2:21:35] of um of Easter is that thinking of um
[2:21:38] the of the resurrection of not only, you
[2:21:41] know, that Christ resurrected, but we
[2:21:43] will be resurrected also one day if we
[2:21:46] go by the way of the grave. That's
[2:21:47] right. So, that's that's Thank you,
[2:21:49] brother Mark. That's good.
[2:22:01] Um, about 18 months ago, I was diagnosed
[2:22:04] with something and I was like, "Sister
[2:22:06] Donna, they told me to go home and get
[2:22:08] everything in order." And I've sat here
[2:22:11] this morning and it feels like
[2:22:13] somebody's got their arms around my rib
[2:22:15] cage and just hugging it a little bit
[2:22:17] too tight. But I'm going to tell you,
[2:22:19] it's why Jesus stole this because he's
[2:22:22] holding on. He's holding on tight. And I
[2:22:25] cannot ask him to let go. And I will not
[2:22:28] because he's put peace in my heart for
[2:22:31] the first time in my life because I have
[2:22:34] had more love shown to
[2:22:38] me since this diagnosis or
[2:22:41] whatever because people don't realize
[2:22:44] but it's the little things in life. The
[2:22:47] hi, the hello. Sister Sherry's got a
[2:22:50] habit of texting me occasionally which
[2:22:52] means the world to me.
[2:22:55] And um but I'm on a
[2:22:59] journey. And the other day I was
[2:23:02] thanking the footprints in the sand. I'm
[2:23:04] not
[2:23:05] alone. I am not
[2:23:07] alone. And the only thing that I'm
[2:23:10] looking for is that cross. Amen. But I
[2:23:13] have peace and
[2:23:15] love. And it means the world to me.
[2:23:19] Yes. And he's my Jesus.
[2:23:22] Amen. Thank you.
[2:23:34] Well, we know that uh Easter is the
[2:23:39] celebration of the death, burial, and
[2:23:41] resurrection of the Lord. And so, what
[2:23:43] Easter means to me is the confirmation
[2:23:47] that everything we believe, every word
[2:23:50] in the Bible is true. because when he
[2:23:53] raised, he proved that he was God. And
[2:23:55] so I just want to thank the Lord for
[2:23:57] what he did on the cross for us. Amen.
[2:24:01] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:24:09] He paid a debt he did not
[2:24:11] owe. I owed a debt I couldn't pay. And
[2:24:14] I'm thankful. That's what Easter means
[2:24:16] to me. Thank you, brother David.
[2:24:37] Mike, if y'all could get that song
[2:24:39] ready. Where the soul never dies.
[2:24:44] Go ahead, Sister Sherry. Right, Stan.
[2:24:46] Um, I think as all you know, good old
[2:24:48] Satan decided to give me a little tiny
[2:24:50] thing called cancer. Um, I'm thankful
[2:24:54] this Easter time because I know that he
[2:24:56] is with me. He's watching over me and
[2:24:59] I'm taking Isaiah 53 as sister Donna
[2:25:02] has. I'm healed. It may not be today. It
[2:25:05] may not be tomorrow because I have to be
[2:25:07] patient. God's teaching me something and
[2:25:09] I'm I'm thankful for that. But I've had
[2:25:12] peace since the day I was diagnosed.
[2:25:14] When I first heard it, all I did was
[2:25:16] just had this piece over me saying,
[2:25:17] "Sherry, I got you." So, I'm thankful
[2:25:20] for having a God and a loving God and a
[2:25:23] and a physician that is much better than
[2:25:25] the ones I'm seeing every day. Thank
[2:25:27] you. Amen.
[2:25:34] All right, Brother Glenn, tell us
[2:25:38] down to it. When I turned 18 and I and
[2:25:42] I'm 77 now, so from 18 to about 72 years
[2:25:46] old, I was sinning and grinning. I had
[2:25:49] sinning down so good that I was just
[2:25:52] having a ball. Now, let me tell you what
[2:25:55] Easter means to me and what the
[2:25:57] crucifixion means is the Lord gave me
[2:26:01] the blood to put all those sins under.
[2:26:05] So, and wipe my slate clean so when I go
[2:26:08] see him, everything I did wrong is in
[2:26:11] the sea of
[2:26:12] forgetfulness. All right? So, that's
[2:26:14] what it means to me. And I'm going to
[2:26:16] tell you, he took care of me even though
[2:26:18] I was not taking him serious back when I
[2:26:22] was young.
[2:26:23] He carried me through at least 100
[2:26:25] firefights in my two tours to Vietnam.
[2:26:29] My I mean, I had soldiers on my right
[2:26:31] dropping, soldiers on my left dropping,
[2:26:34] but somehow another, those bullets kept
[2:26:36] missing me. Hallelujah. So, the Lord
[2:26:38] took care of me. He has a purpose for
[2:26:41] me. And I will I think I might have
[2:26:44] found it because brother Tommy and we go
[2:26:46] to the prison and I just love those
[2:26:49] convicts. Yeah. cuz tried to get them to
[2:26:51] go right and we got one getting baptized
[2:26:54] this coming Saturday. Right, brother
[2:26:58] Tommy? All right. So anyway, the Lord
[2:27:01] has done wonders for me and I thank him
[2:27:05] and I praise him every day. Five or six
[2:27:08] times a day at least.
[2:27:11] That's right. Thank you, brother. Praise
[2:27:12] the Lord. Yeah. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:27:19] Easter means to me that God doesn't
[2:27:22] leave you. He's He never leaves. He's
[2:27:25] always there. Even when you think he's
[2:27:27] not there, he is. He's like standing
[2:27:29] right next to you, elbow to elbow.
[2:27:32] Sometimes when I'm in the car, you know,
[2:27:34] on a long car ride or just heading into
[2:27:36] town, I
[2:27:38] think he's right there and I can count
[2:27:41] on him to do
[2:27:43] anything. He's going to be there no
[2:27:45] matter what.
[2:27:47] If I leave or if I come, it doesn't
[2:27:49] matter. He's going to be there. And I
[2:27:51] know that he can never leave. He never
[2:27:53] will. That's right. And I thank God for
[2:27:55] Easter
[2:27:57] because he did that for me, for all of
[2:28:00] us. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:28:07] Amen. Yes. I think yesterday, the day
[2:28:09] before, he was with her and she was out
[2:28:11] in the yard dancing around and I'm like,
[2:28:13] "Yep, she's a baller.
[2:28:17] Praise the Lord. Good to see your joy.
[2:28:20] The Lord's with you. Amen. All right.
[2:28:22] Who
[2:28:23] else? Got one more.
[2:28:26] Okay, Sister
[2:28:31] Lisa. So, Easter means a lot to me. I
[2:28:35] mean, I know it does to everybody. Um,
[2:28:38] and just going off what Elena said, it
[2:28:42] means to me to never be alone. And I
[2:28:46] mean all my life, I mean from the very
[2:28:49] beginning, God has never left me. He's
[2:28:52] always been there.
[2:28:56] And just from the
[2:29:00] beginning, my grandma took me in, my
[2:29:02] grandma, my grandpa, they took me in and
[2:29:05] they saved me from I don't even know
[2:29:08] what really. There's a lot of things.
[2:29:11] Yeah. And I don't even know where I
[2:29:13] would be today if it wasn't for God
[2:29:15] putting them into my
[2:29:17] life. I could have been
[2:29:20] anywhere, but I'm sitting here
[2:29:24] today. And I have been more than blessed
[2:29:27] through everything in my life. We've all
[2:29:30] made mistakes. I've made many. But God
[2:29:34] has brought me from every one of them.
[2:29:36] And he has showed me that I was never
[2:29:38] alone.
[2:29:40] He brought me a wonderful husband to
[2:29:42] share my testimonies in my life
[2:29:45] with. And I if I had not had God, then I
[2:29:51] probably wouldn't even be here today. I
[2:29:54] may have not even lived a life to be
[2:29:57] honest. But I thank God for everything
[2:30:00] and and for all my healings that he has
[2:30:03] brought me
[2:30:04] to. I just thank God for all of it.
[2:30:07] Amen. That is a miracle.
[2:30:09] Praise the Lord. God has been good to
[2:30:11] you.
[2:30:16] Thank the Lord for his grace. For his
[2:30:19] grace is sufficient for me. I've been
[2:30:23] diagnosed with stage 4 renal failure.
[2:30:27] But I'm not afraid because I know the
[2:30:29] Lord has already healed me and I want to
[2:30:32] thank him for that. Amen. Praise the
[2:30:35] Lord.
[2:30:41] Glory. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
