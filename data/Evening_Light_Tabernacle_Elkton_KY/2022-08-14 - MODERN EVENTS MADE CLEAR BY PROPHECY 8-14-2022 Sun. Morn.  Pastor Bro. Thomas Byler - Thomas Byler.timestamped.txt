[0:01] foreign
[0:53] and the children can be dismissed for
[0:55] sunday school and if you'll go with me
[0:56] in the psalms
[0:58] we'll read psalms 120 and we're going to
[1:01] read 120 and 121.
[1:04] it's not that many
[1:06] verses
[1:07] psalms 120.
[1:22] psalms 120
[1:25] in my distress i cried unto the lord and
[1:28] he hurt
[1:29] me
[1:35] what shall be given unto thee or what
[1:37] shall be done unto thee thou false
[1:39] tongue
[1:45] woe is me that i so drawn in
[1:47] messick that i will dwell in the tents
[1:49] of kidaro
[1:56] i am for peace but when i speak they are
[1:59] for war
[2:03] and if we'll just continue we're going
[2:04] to continue in 121 here too
[2:07] i i will lift up mine eyes unto the
[2:10] hills
[2:11] from whence cometh my hell
[2:18] you will not suffer thy foot to be moved
[2:21] he that keepeth thee will not slumber
[2:29] the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy
[2:31] shade upon thy right hand
[2:39] the lord shall preserve thee from all
[2:41] evil he shall preserve thy soul
[2:44] the lord shall preserve thy going out
[2:46] and thy coming in from this time forth
[2:49] and even forevermore god bless you may
[2:52] be seated brother brian
[3:04] morning brothers and sisters
[3:08] hope you've had a good week
[3:10] as we start another week for me
[3:14] so is you know that last two psalms we
[3:18] were reading
[3:19] there
[3:24] you know it's funny that we all seek
[3:26] peace and they seek war
[3:28] um
[3:30] last
[3:31] the week i
[3:33] lost my voice here
[3:38] i was telling them back there in the
[3:39] prayer room i opened
[3:42] something this morning and it totally
[3:44] took away my concentration
[3:46] um the offering last week was uh 5150
[3:52] there are some people that have some
[3:54] gave me are going to give me some other
[3:55] stuff today but as we stand
[3:58] it's 51.50 so
[4:01] if we uh
[4:03] uh i've when i make that principal
[4:05] payment we'll probably be
[4:08] down to around 51 or 50 excuse me not
[4:11] 50. 61 or 62 thousand dollars
[4:14] if you return with me to romans the
[4:16] eighth chapter
[4:20] you know uh
[4:22] david is pretty prophetic prophetic in
[4:24] the things he said
[4:26] but some 4 000 years ago
[4:31] you know that's the thing about the word
[4:33] of god and the spirit of god
[4:35] what they were
[4:37] what they needed then
[4:38] and what we need now is the same thing
[4:40] the presence of the living god and our
[4:42] hearts and lives
[4:43] but i was going to read
[4:46] i'm in this a lot
[4:48] [Music]
[4:49] but i
[4:51] i was going to read this i hope i didn't
[4:52] lose my
[4:55] i hope i didn't lose my place here i get
[4:57] in such a hurry sometimes it's just that
[4:59] military nature about me
[5:01] um
[5:03] this is uh
[5:06] this was uh
[5:07] i was gonna read this thing this morning
[5:09] this is a lutheran preacher that had
[5:11] this devotional prior to world war ii
[5:14] and how
[5:15] how timely what he was thinking
[5:18] in this
[5:19] time how it is today in our time
[5:22] and i'll just read what he had to say it
[5:24] goes back to revelations the third
[5:26] chapter and the second verse
[5:29] and many of the securities which we
[5:31] thought were solid are crumbling in in
[5:34] these critical times so you have to
[5:37] think this man in his time was you know
[5:39] 1940 1941 so he's talking about the
[5:42] world then was crumbling before them
[5:45] with what was going on and around in the
[5:47] world and you bring it up to 2022 how
[5:51] how much worse is it now in our day and
[5:53] age and he goes on to say
[5:56] uh but there are eternal things that
[5:59] cannot go or will not go
[6:02] there are timeless everlasting
[6:04] sustaining values of god and we all
[6:08] have
[6:08] hearts and lives today that hasn't
[6:10] changed
[6:12] during the first century when the world
[6:14] was going to pieces and you know a lot
[6:17] of examples if you look at paul's time
[6:20] all the things you know the roman empire
[6:22] all the abuses that were given to the
[6:24] church in that day and age and brother
[6:26] bradham taught us that maybe
[6:28] it's we're not going to be like paul but
[6:30] the day's coming may be like paul's time
[6:32] but right now it's the battle in your
[6:34] mind this morning where you have to
[6:36] fight daily to keep all that
[6:38] negativity all that stuff it shouldn't
[6:41] be in your heart and mind you got to
[6:42] push it and keep it out and he goes on
[6:46] i lost my place uh during the first
[6:48] century when the world was going to
[6:50] pieces
[6:51] john wrote a message of cheer to the
[6:53] church of sardis strengthen those things
[6:55] which remain
[6:57] and what are these realities that will
[6:59] will not go first god's love
[7:01] you know that's in the message of the
[7:02] hour you know god loves us all he
[7:04] desires for you all to have a greater
[7:06] relationship this morning than you did
[7:08] yesterday morning i haven't persuaded
[7:11] that neither death nor life nor angels
[7:13] nor principalities
[7:15] nor powers nor things present or things
[7:17] to come nor height nor death nor any
[7:20] other creature shall be able to separate
[7:22] us from the love of god which is in
[7:24] christ jesus now that's in romans 8 you
[7:27] know
[7:31] it's one of those chapters those
[7:32] everlasting internal chapters that if
[7:35] any time you get a position in your life
[7:36] when you're really low in in your
[7:38] relationship that's one of those
[7:40] chapters that'll lift you up and it goes
[7:43] on
[7:44] he says here i don't want to keep
[7:45] rereading the same thing no matter what
[7:47] happens take refuge in the golden pledge
[7:50] that the love of god remains constant as
[7:53] a magnificent
[7:55] magnificent
[7:56] stabilizer for courageous living
[7:59] and then he and then this is the most
[8:01] important thing i thought for the time
[8:03] that we're in this morning
[8:04] and and i'll just this guy's a lutheran
[8:07] in 1940 so the second is the power of
[8:10] prayer
[8:12] someone asked about the this i don't
[8:15] know who this artist was this way
[8:17] artist what do you do when you lose your
[8:20] vision and that's the same for us this
[8:22] morning what do we do
[8:24] when we lose our vision when life is so
[8:26] hard
[8:28] then everything seems so dark and he
[8:31] goes on to say here
[8:33] i lost my place again he turned to his
[8:35] wife for the answer
[8:37] we kneeled down and prayed she replied
[8:39] the mightiest power in the world which
[8:41] can conquer anything
[8:43] is the power of prayer and that hasn't
[8:45] changed it's been that way for for the
[8:48] last 6 000 years no matter what position
[8:51] you're in this morning wherever you're
[8:53] at all you have to do is stop
[8:56] and pray and just believe that god's
[8:58] going to do something for you and then
[9:00] he goes on
[9:01] the third jesus christ he is the same
[9:03] yesterday today and forever
[9:06] and his truth remains that's the same
[9:08] for us today in the year 2022.
[9:10] you can't change that that's that's
[9:12] eternal and he goes on he's his truth
[9:16] remains his divinity remains
[9:18] his deathless message of salvation from
[9:21] california's cross remains no force on
[9:24] earth is powerful enough to overthrow
[9:26] him long after the sun has
[9:29] set in the skies forevermore his person
[9:32] his work everything for which he stands
[9:34] will remain and that you can't and this
[9:37] man that you know this is what almost 80
[9:39] years ago
[9:40] but the truths the messenger of the hour
[9:43] all these great examples that we have
[9:45] doesn't change the fact that god is
[9:47] there for us every day of our life and
[9:49] he's
[9:51] more than able to minister into the
[9:53] needs that you need this morning
[9:55] and i was uh
[9:57] i'll jump here i hope i didn't lose my
[9:59] place
[10:00] but i took copied this and i was
[10:03] thinking this morning i'm going to read
[10:05] out of revelations the third chapter
[10:08] a couple of a
[10:09] couple of these scriptures here and i
[10:11] was thinking of what's going on in the
[10:13] world this morning
[10:14] and uh
[10:15] this is what
[10:17] the first couple of verses in the third
[10:19] chapter of
[10:20] revelation says
[10:22] and on to the angel of the church of
[10:24] sardo's right these things saith he that
[10:27] hath the seven spirits of god
[10:29] and the seven stars
[10:31] i know thy works and thou has a name
[10:34] but thou livest in our dead so we stole
[10:37] my note thy works and he says thou
[10:39] livest and thou are dead
[10:41] and he goes on to tell him be watchful
[10:43] and strengthen the things which remain
[10:45] that are ready to die for i have not
[10:48] found my works perfect before god
[10:50] i know we're living in the last age but
[10:52] i'm thinking of what's going on in
[10:54] luther's time
[10:56] and and i have a thought about it i'll
[10:59] remember thought they received the herb
[11:02] hold fast and repent if therefore
[11:04] thou shalt not watch i will come to thee
[11:07] as a thief and thou shall not know what
[11:09] hour i will come upon them
[11:11] and uh and then the last i'll read this
[11:13] fourth or earth thou has a few names
[11:16] even in sardis
[11:18] which have not defiled their garments
[11:19] and they shall walk with me away for
[11:22] they are worthy
[11:23] and i took this out of the church age
[11:26] but
[11:27] i'm not going to read all of this this
[11:28] morning but i i wrote some notes
[11:31] the thing about the age you think of uh
[11:34] luther's time or
[11:35] wesley's time or paul's time
[11:38] that the thing that happens in any of
[11:41] these ages
[11:42] if you don't reach out in faith and
[11:44] receive the true baptism of the holy
[11:46] ghost your foundation isn't going to be
[11:49] right so that's how you wind up with the
[11:51] lutheran church you wind up with
[11:54] the churches after wesley or the
[11:56] churches you know all those different
[11:58] wind up with all those different
[12:00] organizations because they didn't move
[12:02] with god as god was moving and it's no
[12:05] different for us this morning you've got
[12:07] to move as god leads you in your life
[12:10] your family's life or church life
[12:12] whatever is if you don't move as god's
[12:14] revealing then you're going to be just
[12:16] you're going to be no different than
[12:18] these organizations and being a message
[12:21] believer doesn't
[12:22] make these rules not apply to you they
[12:24] rep apply to you just as much or to me
[12:27] as anyone else and i'll just read some
[12:30] of the things and i was just thinking
[12:33] i i wrote this thing
[12:35] bad things are formed in people's lives
[12:37] churches governments without it so if
[12:40] you don't move you know there's three
[12:42] works of grace if you don't move through
[12:44] the first two works and get sealed in by
[12:46] the baptism of the holy ghost
[12:49] then that's what happens to any
[12:51] government any church any individual
[12:55] the end your your foundation is wrong so
[12:58] everything that you are is wrong and he
[13:00] goes on
[13:01] and you have to move past the first two
[13:03] works and go into the final work of
[13:05] grace doesn't mean that you don't learn
[13:07] and you don't apply yourself every day
[13:10] in that walk but i'll just read
[13:11] i don't want to take a lot of time this
[13:13] morning i'll get started and i won't
[13:15] stop but
[13:16] this is what brother branham had saying
[13:18] it
[13:19] these are just a couple of bulletin
[13:22] bullets he had in this book and it's on
[13:24] page of 253 and he says i know thy works
[13:28] what are what are these works that came
[13:30] up before the lord and caused this
[13:31] displeasure well you know that each our
[13:33] age lap over into the next stage so we
[13:36] have a continuation of the works of the
[13:38] fourth age into the fifth and those were
[13:40] so and we're at the end now so
[13:43] all those things are just brought and
[13:46] are just heaping on top of themselves
[13:49] and then the leadership of the holy
[13:50] ghost was suspended by human hierarchy
[13:53] and that's what i'm talking about this
[13:55] morning if you don't move into the last
[13:57] stage that last step where you get
[14:00] sealed in by the baptism of the holy
[14:02] ghost you're going to be no different
[14:03] than any of these other examples
[14:06] that are here this morning
[14:08] and he goes the second bullet is on the
[14:10] pages the pure word of god and its free
[14:13] benefits to all men was disposed for
[14:16] that's what i was saying earlier for
[14:18] creeds dogma church order exec
[14:22] you can't break these fundamentals
[14:24] and the third one
[14:26] the worship of in the spirit and the
[14:28] gifts of the spirit and all that was
[14:29] pertains to the true community of
[14:31] fellowship of the saints was cast aside
[14:34] for the liturgy
[14:36] and literal light of worship pagan
[14:38] feasts you know it's racist attack but
[14:40] boy i can understand this a little bit
[14:43] and then the worship of mary i'm not
[14:45] going to read that the whole paragraph
[14:47] there my point being this morning as
[14:49] individuals
[14:51] this morning we all have to move past
[14:53] and i'll let me go to romans the
[14:57] eighth chapter that's where that
[14:59] that thing came from i thought i marked
[15:01] it this morning but
[15:05] i made an effort when i was a younger
[15:07] man
[15:08] some of the stuff i could
[15:10] i could save from memory i i don't try
[15:12] to say it for memory now anymore because
[15:16] i probably misplace it
[15:18] i think
[15:19] i don't have the right spot again
[15:29] i'll i'll just read these verses and sit
[15:31] down if you return me the romans the
[15:32] eighth chapter
[15:35] about
[15:36] the 33rd verse and you know it speaks
[15:38] for itself i you know i'm quick to say
[15:40] something like that whatever i say
[15:42] doesn't mean anything unless you can't
[15:43] bring it through the word of god and the
[15:45] message of the hour you know i'm not
[15:47] afraid to say that i will tell any man
[15:50] that and he goes on to say the 34th
[15:52] verse
[15:53] who is thee that condemneth of christ
[15:55] that died ye rather that
[15:57] is risen again
[15:59] who is ever at the right hand of god who
[16:01] make his intercessor for us so that's a
[16:03] comforting thought there that literally
[16:06] christ is sitting there for you today
[16:09] to do that for you as long as you are
[16:11] willing to
[16:12] put it on him you know a lot of times i
[16:15] i can only speak for myself i like to
[16:17] carry a lot of things you know i
[16:20] i don't think i'm worthy of this or that
[16:22] i i'm one of those people that likes to
[16:24] carry a lot of things sometimes you just
[16:26] got to let that burden go
[16:28] and he goes
[16:29] who shall separate us from the love of
[16:31] christ shall tributation or distress or
[16:33] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[16:36] pearl or sword as it is written for thy
[16:38] sakes we were killed all the day long
[16:41] you know we are counted as sheep
[16:42] slaughter so when you read something
[16:44] like that you realize in context
[16:47] you got to be close to jesus christ this
[16:49] morning and it goes nay and all these
[16:50] things we are more than conquerors
[16:52] through him that loved us for i am
[16:55] persuaded neither death nor life nor
[16:57] angels nor principalities nor power
[17:00] no things present nor things to come nor
[17:03] heights or depths or any other creatures
[17:05] shall be able to separate us from the
[17:07] love of god which is in christ jesus our
[17:10] lord and that's a comforting thought
[17:11] this morning
[17:13] so no matter what those circumstances
[17:15] are in your life this morning you know
[17:16] god knows him
[17:18] he knows what you need this morning he
[17:20] knows exactly what you need and all you
[17:22] have to do is reach out of faith and
[17:24] claim whatever god has for you this
[17:26] morning
[17:28] brother david
[17:37] it's good to see each and every one out
[17:38] this morning and
[17:40] man it's good to be in the house of the
[17:41] lord isn't it

[42:40] right praise the lord you can be seated
[42:42] this morning thank you musicians
[42:46] amen god is good isn't he
[42:48] amen i sure appreciate the lord i want
[42:51] to go over this with you with my paper
[42:55] this morning
[42:56] amen recently we had a
[42:58] person come up
[43:00] to uh
[43:02] it's actually a mennonite but
[43:05] he asked if we would sell that field
[43:07] back over here
[43:08] uh it's basically the fence line you
[43:11] were seeing my fence maybe a little bit
[43:13] left of that
[43:15] and then go across the back of the woods
[43:18] maybe all the way across to the other
[43:19] side of the creek all the way up our
[43:21] property line pretty much goes up behind
[43:23] those houses over there but he asked if
[43:25] we would sell it and i took it up with
[43:27] the trustees and the board and they all
[43:29] voted to basically bring it before the
[43:32] church for a vote amen i believe
[43:34] something like that ought to be done by
[43:36] the majority of the congregation
[43:38] at least i felt like it should amen
[43:40] and so anyway i'm going to show you just
[43:42] a little bit if i this this probably
[43:45] won't help you a lot but
[43:47] i'm going to want to show it to you
[43:48] anyway but that's why i described it
[43:50] just a little bit
[43:51] um
[43:53] kind of i guess
[43:56] you know because you know the land
[43:57] better than what you probably know this
[43:59] but i'll hold it up here would you help
[44:01] me you too
[44:04] let me see how we are here and you have
[44:06] to have i hope you're going to have to
[44:07] have glasses to see this one come on
[44:09] brother daniel hold this side for me
[44:11] all right so let me see where we're at
[44:13] here's our driveway
[44:15] right here
[44:16] um
[44:18] and then here's the
[44:22] church i think that's the old church the
[44:24] fellowship hall because our church would
[44:25] be up here
[44:27] but this is our volleyball
[44:29] uh net back here and so forth and goes
[44:31] all the way back to the woods
[44:33] right through there
[44:34] and then here's a pin down at the
[44:36] corner of that which down there
[44:38] okay and then what we would do is take
[44:40] from that pin probably come out to our
[44:42] septic system and then we go from our
[44:44] septic system straight across here so we
[44:47] have all of our woods and this field on
[44:49] the side and the graveyard we still have
[44:51] all of that over there it's just this
[44:53] back here and i know this is real rocky
[44:56] i mean you have to watch where you go or
[44:58] it'll tear the wheels off your tractor
[44:59] i've motored several times i'm not too
[45:01] impressed with it so i'm not going to
[45:02] miss it any if if you don't
[45:05] and so
[45:06] uh anyway that's what we're thinking
[45:08] about doing we have two buyers and men
[45:10] that are very interested so
[45:12] um we we don't know we'll talk to the
[45:14] board again and just decide on what
[45:16] price that we ask for but we're probably
[45:18] looking at around 50 55 000
[45:21] somewhere in there it'll bring it within
[45:23] you know a year maybe maybe 12 000 if it
[45:26] was 50 it would be 12 000 if we get 55
[45:29] it's only 7 000 we would owe salon
[45:31] church so we could get this knocked off
[45:33] amen so that's kind of direction i said
[45:35] well maybe this is an opportunity we
[45:37] know that in real estate right now it's
[45:39] at the peak and so we don't know what
[45:41] the future holds but if we could get out
[45:43] of debt i think it'd be nice but you
[45:45] decide we don't have to do it
[45:47] amen so you think we should keep on hang
[45:49] on to it we will but that's the idea
[45:52] okay
[45:53] all right so god bless you let me fill
[45:55] that up for me with you well
[45:57] i'm gonna have brothers david and
[45:59] brother
[46:00] steve come up and we'll just take a hand
[46:03] vote for this if that would be okay
[46:05] amen
[46:07] so if they would come up at this time
[46:09] amen and we'll have everybody close
[46:11] their eyes and so forth
[46:12] i'm just going to go back here for just
[46:14] a second and so forth but anyway we'll
[46:16] take to let them count the vote
[46:20] [Music]
[46:25] all right
[46:26] everybody that's in favor raise your
[46:28] hand this morning
[46:45] okay
[46:46] anyone not in favor and raise your hand
[47:01] okay you can lower your hands god bless
[47:03] you for the thomas
[47:11] all right thank you so we'll go ahead
[47:13] and see what we can do it looks like it
[47:15] is a go amen
[47:17] so
[47:18] we'll do get the most that we can out of
[47:20] with the help of the lord and
[47:22] and so forth um
[47:24] praise the lord god bless you
[47:27] and thank you god god bless you richly
[47:29] for that offering last weekend amen over
[47:32] five thousand dollars so that really
[47:33] knocked it down amen a lot on the
[47:35] principle
[47:36] and so that'll help us get us closer to
[47:39] the mark amen how many likes to pay off
[47:41] bills i don't know about you but i like
[47:43] to pay off bills i mean it's it's it's
[47:45] wonderful amen maybe we'll have a
[47:47] special meetings or something afterwards
[47:49] to celebrate once we get this place sold
[47:52] amen maybe we can get one of those
[47:54] those
[47:56] uh big name preachers in here some no
[47:58] i'm just
[48:00] i mean i've got a hard time getting them
[48:02] here i'll tell you what i've asked
[48:03] people many different times to come but
[48:05] amen they're very very busy so
[48:08] anyway praise the lord well i have
[48:10] something on my heart
[48:12] this morning that's really
[48:15] kind of a sincere
[48:17] urgent kind of a message amen
[48:20] and
[48:21] i know that uh
[48:23] i just you know it's kind of
[48:26] more of a solemn solemn
[48:28] uh and but branham talked about it
[48:30] called it it's almost scary
[48:32] i amen it's the word that he used amen
[48:35] and so
[48:36] um and we want to preach on and speak on
[48:39] modern events made clear by prophecy
[48:42] amen
[48:43] if we want to look at our modern events
[48:45] that are made clear by prophecy amen
[48:51] and so if you will stand with me we'll
[48:52] go before the lord in prayer
[48:56] kind heavenly father we come before you
[48:58] this morning lord jesus
[49:00] knowing father that that which i feel
[49:03] you've laid upon my heart to speak on
[49:04] this morning is very serious
[49:07] and no doubt it'll cause us all to
[49:09] search your hearts father to see where
[49:10] we're at with you lord jesus and we
[49:12] think of the words
[49:14] that you spoke and how that you said
[49:15] watch
[49:16] watch many times you said watch look
[49:20] for you know not the day or the hour
[49:21] that your lord does come but if the
[49:24] goodman of the house would have watched
[49:27] he would have not suffered his house to
[49:28] be broken up and lord as we look this
[49:31] morning and as we're watching and
[49:32] waiting for you coming we ask god this
[49:34] morning you would just take the thoughts
[49:36] and meditation of our heart take your
[49:37] word lord jesus and and make it plain to
[49:40] the people and help us to
[49:42] be closer and get closer to you lord
[49:44] this morning than what we were when we
[49:45] come in those doors father forgive us of
[49:48] all sins all failures and trespasses god
[49:51] in jesus christ's name we ask these
[49:52] blessings and favors amen and amen
[49:56] all right so this morning we want to do
[49:58] and i'll be honest with y'all i you know
[50:01] i've got quite a bit of reading that i'd
[50:03] like to do and the reason that i like to
[50:05] do a little bit of reading is because
[50:07] you know we could take billy graham's uh
[50:09] word or robert's word great men we could
[50:12] take the words of great men but there's
[50:14] no greater that you can take that when
[50:17] jesus comes down after he says something
[50:19] and a man that'll say look if i've told
[50:21] you truth and jesus don't come you ain't
[50:23] got to believe me
[50:25] isn't that right he would say it in that
[50:27] manner that if jesus don't come and
[50:29] prove and vindicate that what i've said
[50:30] the truth you really you know it's just
[50:32] my word but if he comes and backs it up
[50:35] well you better believe it is that right
[50:37] so
[50:38] that's what we that's why i have so much
[50:40] confidence in the prophet of god and
[50:41] what he said
[50:43] amen and today with the help of the lord
[50:45] if you'll pray for me we're going to
[50:46] look at some things that's going on and
[50:49] it's going to be very political amen
[50:51] very political and if you don't think
[50:53] brother branham got political listen to
[50:55] jezebel religion amen
[50:57] boy he got really political amen and i
[51:00] realize and i know there's certain laws
[51:02] that if you promote a certain person or
[51:04] whatever amen they threaten to take your
[51:07] what is it called
[51:09] uh exemption or whatever away you know
[51:12] and and so forth and and i know one
[51:14] place brother bam says he knows he makes
[51:16] the statement you got a right to say
[51:17] that he says oh yes i do it's the word
[51:19] of god but taking the things and we're
[51:21] not promoting a man or this out of the
[51:23] other but one thing we are doing is
[51:25] promoting the word of god and taking the
[51:27] things that are out there that's
[51:29] happening
[51:30] amen and putting it with the word of god
[51:31] and seeing where we're at
[51:34] aren't you glad you we want to do that
[51:35] this morning with the help of the lord
[51:36] to see where we're at and and i hope you
[51:40] got a comfortable seat so
[51:42] we might go a little lengthy would that
[51:43] be okay
[51:45] amen i don't think that hurts
[51:47] oh my
[51:48] i'm gonna save something i heard brother
[51:50] i'm saying he was talking about uh uh
[51:53] uh what was his name now again anyway it
[51:55] was the pastor there at the church i
[51:58] should remember but anyway he was
[52:00] talking about how short of sermon he
[52:01] preached and he says man he only
[52:02] preached so long he says and then he
[52:04] quit he was just starting to get into it
[52:06] and he said that's a shame
[52:08] i was like wow he just rebuked the
[52:10] pastor for having short and says you
[52:12] know you know but that's the way brother
[52:14] man was he believed in putting plenty of
[52:16] plenty of it into it amen
[52:18] plenty of time so praise god
[52:20] let's turn our bibles if you will amen
[52:23] and i had a hard time really knowing
[52:24] just which scripture to go to because
[52:26] there's so many but this is kind of why
[52:27] i feel led to go and let's go to matthew
[52:30] 24
[52:31] and so i don't know you know just pray
[52:33] for me in the next few services to see
[52:35] which way the lord wants me to go to
[52:37] continue this and go so far or what but
[52:40] i really wanted i wanted kind of to
[52:42] speak this on wednesday but i knew it
[52:43] would be long so i had another message
[52:46] laid on my heart and so i said i'll just
[52:47] take that one and we'll speak that
[52:49] wednesday amen and then do this this
[52:52] morning so we've been looking forward to
[52:54] this
[52:56] all right matthew 24.
[53:00] 30
[53:01] let's go with 38
[53:05] actually
[53:06] 37 let's go to
[53:08] 37 but as the days of noah were so also
[53:11] shall also the coming of the son of man
[53:13] be
[53:14] for
[53:16] in the days that were before the flood
[53:18] they were eating and drinking marrying
[53:20] and giving in marriage until the day
[53:22] that noah entered into the ark and knew
[53:24] not until the flood came and took them
[53:26] all away so shall also the coming of the
[53:28] son of man be then shall two be in the
[53:31] field the one shall be taken in the
[53:32] other left two women shall be grinding
[53:34] at the meal the one shall be taken and
[53:36] the other one left
[53:38] watch therefore for you know not what
[53:40] hour your lord does come but know this
[53:43] that if the goodman of the house would
[53:45] have known what watched the thief would
[53:46] come he would have watched and would not
[53:48] have suffered his house to be broken up
[53:51] therefore be ye also ready for in such
[53:54] an hour to think not the son of man
[53:56] cometh who then is a faithful and a wise
[53:58] servant whom his lord
[54:00] hath made ruler over his howl soul to
[54:02] give
[54:03] them meat in due season blessed is that
[54:06] servant whom his lord
[54:09] fight
[54:10] when he cometh shall find so doing
[54:13] verily i say unto you that he shall make
[54:15] his him ruler over all his house and
[54:18] then of course we know if the evil
[54:20] servant says you know my lord delays
[54:22] he's coming amen
[54:24] and i'm going to tell you right now as a
[54:26] pastor i believe that that's what we
[54:27] have to watch
[54:29] people
[54:30] just think that it's going to keep going
[54:31] on amen
[54:33] amen and then and they kind of plan
[54:36] can keep you going on the believer is
[54:38] not planning on this thing going on he
[54:41] is planning to have this thing come down
[54:43] to
[54:44] close
[54:45] god bless you
[54:46] amen may god bless the reading of the
[54:48] word amen you can be seated praise be to
[54:52] god
[54:53] amen
[54:55] now remember brun place brother bab
[54:57] talked about it he made when he was
[54:59] speaking about
[55:00] the third poll
[55:02] okay
[55:03] he says now he was talking about the
[55:05] third pool and so forth
[55:07] he says i must lay and i'm not going to
[55:08] read that first part i'm going to read
[55:10] that later maybe but it says i must lay
[55:12] quiet now for just a little while
[55:15] remember
[55:16] who you who's listening to this tape
[55:18] amen
[55:19] you might see such a change in my
[55:21] ministry i believe it is 63. he says
[55:24] right away dropping back not going up
[55:27] but dropping back we're right at the age
[55:30] now it can't go any further and we have
[55:33] to wait here
[55:34] just a minute until this happens over
[55:37] here to catch up
[55:39] amen
[55:41] so you're talking to me that was a
[55:43] prophecy going forth that the word has
[55:45] went forth now but guess what we have to
[55:47] wait here and some things are going to
[55:49] have to catch up
[55:52] and i believe you and i believe this
[55:54] morning that we're at that catching up
[55:57] time
[55:58] i believe it has caught up
[56:00] and it's happening right there in front
[56:03] of us
[56:04] i don't want you to miss it i want you
[56:06] to but with the help of the lord to
[56:07] realize where we're at you know in this
[56:09] hour that we're living in each and every
[56:11] one of us knows what it's like to go to
[56:13] a certain place or travel to a certain
[56:15] place and it's pretty glorious because
[56:17] all you got to ask a person is can you
[56:19] give me the address
[56:21] is that right give me the address i can
[56:24] take it from there
[56:26] amen because you can program it into a
[56:28] gps
[56:29] and that gps
[56:31] huh
[56:32] isn't it nice
[56:34] it'll actually tell you 500 yards 300
[56:37] yards and then it'll say turn
[56:42] it says take a right now this is where
[56:44] you do it
[56:45] you know i thought you know that soul in
[56:48] the natural
[56:49] i believe that in the spiritual realm
[56:52] god has given us the scripture i believe
[56:54] if he told us to watch the signs of the
[56:56] time if he gives us certain signs and
[56:59] certain things to watch i believe that
[57:01] if we catch that
[57:05] what if we miss it
[57:08] now how many knows the whole world
[57:09] missed the sign behold i'll send you a
[57:11] lie to the prophet before great and
[57:12] gratefully
[57:14] i i'm sure
[57:15] i'm not sure who it was either but brian
[57:17] or brother david mentioned how the the
[57:19] world has no clue
[57:21] they're really out there and they don't
[57:23] know where they're at or what what's
[57:24] going on other than it's getting more
[57:25] wicked but you know what's going on you
[57:28] know why it's going on i mean we all
[57:30] know why it is like it is the condition
[57:33] that we're in
[57:36] amen and so we've been given the
[57:38] scriptures we've been given the quotes i
[57:39] believe if we're prayerful that god will
[57:42] reveal it to us in the message of the
[57:45] hour where we are so that you can be
[57:47] ready
[57:47] [Music]
[57:50] amen
[57:52] and you know one of the things that uh
[57:54] one of the things and that really was a
[57:57] milestone to brother branham it was a
[57:59] real milestone
[58:01] and it was when kennedy when they elect
[58:03] kennedy in as president
[58:06] he had a lot to say about that
[58:08] amen
[58:09] he had a lot to say about it
[58:12] and um
[58:13] [Music]
[58:15] politically
[58:17] talking to black people talking about
[58:19] whether you're republican or a democrat
[58:21] and so forth and he realized that
[58:24] something was happening
[58:27] something had happened
[58:30] all right
[58:32] i'm going to change classes a little bit
[58:34] bear with me
[58:37] brother bam says now
[58:41] he says there was a time when america
[58:43] wouldn't have
[58:45] they'd known better than to have let
[58:47] that old prostitute that old harlot
[58:50] that's drunk with the blood of the
[58:52] martyrs
[58:53] huh
[58:54] now we're talking about we know that
[58:56] americans and so forth our forefathers
[58:59] we fled to america for what
[59:02] for freedom of religion
[59:05] to get away from the persecution of the
[59:08] church that killed 68 million basically
[59:11] away from catholicism
[59:15] amen
[59:16] to get away from catholicism
[59:21] and here
[59:23] brother ben says
[59:25] that old harlot the drunk with the blood
[59:27] of the martyrs killed them and the
[59:28] reason that they fled here for freedom
[59:31] they wouldn't have put up
[59:34] with nothing like that what was his name
[59:36] al shrapton or something like that ran
[59:38] for president just a little before that
[59:40] and they were still awake he said they
[59:42] no way they were going to have that
[59:44] they wouldn't vote that but now a little
[59:46] bit later brother ma'am talked about
[59:48] even letting the women vote and so forth
[59:51] for f kennedy you know when he was a
[59:53] ladies man he was all this side of the
[59:55] other hello
[59:57] he was smarter and everything else in
[59:59] the debate and so forth
[1:00:01] and he says and now he said
[1:00:04] you know i like like i said
[1:00:07] and the reason they fled here freedom
[1:00:09] they wouldn't have put up with nothing
[1:00:11] like that it shows that we're in a
[1:00:14] backslidden condition
[1:00:16] [Applause]
[1:00:18] amen the nation got backslid
[1:00:23] oh my
[1:00:25] i'm not going to go through the whole
[1:00:26] long spiel this morning uh of how that
[1:00:30] america paralleled israel
[1:00:32] is that right how that god gave them
[1:00:34] great kings and they inhabited the land
[1:00:36] and took over so forth you know uh and
[1:00:39] just like we did with the indians and
[1:00:40] everything a whole great man induces
[1:00:42] until he finally got away from god and
[1:00:44] now we pick it up where he got away from
[1:00:46] god
[1:00:47] where america got away from god and they
[1:00:50] got into a backslidden condition and he
[1:00:52] said even the pentecostals and so forth
[1:00:54] because even though brother bannon
[1:00:55] didn't vote
[1:00:57] he says he knew that all of these
[1:00:58] religious people that they do vote
[1:01:01] isn't that right and so forth nothing
[1:01:03] wrong with vote and so forth but listen
[1:01:04] he he says you know that they actually
[1:01:06] got in a backslidden condition a whole
[1:01:09] he says a whole nation to elect such as
[1:01:13] that of course
[1:01:15] and now he says you know some of you
[1:01:16] square back democrats will think this oh
[1:01:19] well he'll make a good politician head
[1:01:21] that might sound good but he says that's
[1:01:24] not according to the word of god
[1:01:27] and another place he talked about the
[1:01:28] different politicians you know how that
[1:01:30] they are sponsored by whiskey making and
[1:01:33] cigarettes and promising tax cuts this
[1:01:35] out of the other when they do get in
[1:01:37] they go ahead and cut taxes on what they
[1:01:40] promised and who supported them
[1:01:43] isn't that how politics works
[1:01:46] amen and that's what took them in there
[1:01:48] praise god oh
[1:01:50] my hallelujah
[1:01:55] oh my
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:01:58] think about that
[1:02:00] and another one he says now you see why
[1:02:02] my voice is going to be stopped pretty
[1:02:04] soon he thought perhaps somebody was
[1:02:05] going to shoot him for what he said
[1:02:09] but somebody's got to know it yes why
[1:02:11] revelations 2 20 she called herself a
[1:02:13] prophetess isn't that right i'm going to
[1:02:16] turn to that for a minute
[1:02:18] revelations 3 and i'm going to read that
[1:02:20] in verse 20. notwithstanding i have a
[1:02:23] few things against you because thou
[1:02:25] sufferest that woman jezebel
[1:02:28] which calleth herself a prophetess to
[1:02:30] teach and to seduce my servants to
[1:02:32] commit fornication
[1:02:34] now notice he was talking to the second
[1:02:36] church age
[1:02:37] and to eat things sacrificed to idols
[1:02:40] and i gave her space to repent of her
[1:02:42] fornication she she repented not
[1:02:45] that happened i believe when uh you know
[1:02:47] all of those great prophets came to them
[1:02:50] in the church
[1:02:53] of rome and tried to get him to turn
[1:02:54] around but they wouldn't turn around
[1:02:56] they would not repent catholic church
[1:02:58] would not repent
[1:03:01] and i says behold i will cast her into a
[1:03:03] bed and them that commit adultery with
[1:03:06] her into great tribulation unless they
[1:03:10] repented their deeds didn't better ban
[1:03:13] talk about in this generation her
[1:03:15] children were given a chance to repent
[1:03:18] baptist methodist
[1:03:20] all of them they were all given a chance
[1:03:22] to repent
[1:03:24] many chances to repent but did they
[1:03:26] repent no they did not repent or they'd
[1:03:28] be sitting here this morning
[1:03:30] believe in god's works and what he did
[1:03:34] and now because they did not repent
[1:03:36] i will accept the repentance and i will
[1:03:39] kill her children remember it's not just
[1:03:41] about jezebel
[1:03:45] oh my you see why it parallels so much
[1:03:47] with america hello
[1:03:49] because it was that same jezebel system
[1:03:52] israel was all right until ahab married
[1:03:54] jezebel
[1:03:56] and how many knows that ahab was not
[1:03:58] really the figurehead
[1:04:01] he was not the really one the one that
[1:04:02] was in control it was that woman behind
[1:04:04] her jezebel
[1:04:06] look what we got in office today
[1:04:09] you see biden did this fight i don't do
[1:04:12] nothing except what he's told
[1:04:14] he can't read and talk unless he's so
[1:04:16] what dude he's got to be told when to
[1:04:18] shut up
[1:04:20] come on folks
[1:04:23] that's right and look at how much look
[1:04:25] at how much it is so there's somebody
[1:04:26] behind that driving it
[1:04:29] whoo
[1:04:31] now we'll give unto all mice that's
[1:04:33] right
[1:04:33] no no killer children with death and
[1:04:36] that all the churches may know that i am
[1:04:37] he which searches the reigns and the
[1:04:39] hearts and i will give to every man
[1:04:41] according to his works
[1:04:44] my
[1:04:45] so i will kill her children
[1:04:48] with death isn't that something
[1:04:51] he's going to cast her
[1:04:53] into
[1:04:54] and those that commit adultery into
[1:04:57] great
[1:04:57] [Applause]
[1:04:58] tribulation i mean those that promise
[1:05:00] the great tribulation period
[1:05:03] they're going to go into the great
[1:05:04] tribulation fear
[1:05:10] amen we have to ask ourselves lord jesus
[1:05:13] you know and i want to tell you
[1:05:14] something i truly believe that only
[1:05:15] those who have something in their heart
[1:05:17] the elect that are going to care about
[1:05:19] their walk with god everybody else gets
[1:05:21] lukewarm

[1:05:44] right at the doors
[1:05:46] amen
[1:05:48] praise be to god all right let me go
[1:05:50] down this road a little bit
[1:05:52] in the first event jesus the whole world
[1:05:54] was corrupted with politics and
[1:05:56] religions and so forth
[1:05:58] and they wanted an anointed one so forth
[1:06:01] today russia wants a messiah isn't it
[1:06:03] something i everybody wants to be the
[1:06:05] greatest
[1:06:07] everyone wants to think they're the
[1:06:08] greatest it's that or the other
[1:06:10] they're one of the messiah and so forth
[1:06:12] what did what did america what do you
[1:06:14] want america you're crying the lioness
[1:06:16] what do you want isn't that what we're
[1:06:18] all doing especially the left and the
[1:06:19] right
[1:06:20] oh we want this and we want that and we
[1:06:23] want an educated genius and you've been
[1:06:25] wanting a political genius and now you
[1:06:27] got it
[1:06:28] though you had to invent a crooked
[1:06:30] voting machine to
[1:06:32] get it
[1:06:34] huh
[1:06:35] way back then think about it how did
[1:06:37] that go crooked vote so what did brother
[1:06:40] brown say he said you know
[1:06:42] crooked voting machine
[1:06:48] oh my look at what we got today
[1:06:52] oh just as crooked as you can be
[1:06:54] right
[1:06:56] now notice even the churches want a
[1:06:58] genius we won't get too much into that
[1:07:00] but everybody's trying to have the
[1:07:01] biggest name preacher in this that or
[1:07:03] the other sorry crept into the message
[1:07:08] you know everybody trying to be the
[1:07:09] greatest or just that or the other
[1:07:12] you sorry thing you if you'd realize a
[1:07:14] prophet of god has said you need to see
[1:07:16] how small you can get not how big you
[1:07:19] can get the further bigger you want to
[1:07:20] try to be the further away you get from
[1:07:22] god
[1:07:24] see how small you can be how humble you
[1:07:26] can be
[1:07:27] amen
[1:07:29] oh my but they all want a savior
[1:07:31] somebody to save him and so forth
[1:07:33] amen
[1:07:35] but you know what what you need is the
[1:07:37] savior
[1:07:39] that's just exactly what you need and
[1:07:41] god knows what you have needed is a
[1:07:43] savior and he send it to you and they
[1:07:46] don't want it
[1:07:50] we had a genius
[1:07:52] we had a superman
[1:07:55] it's christ
[1:07:57] through the body of christ through the
[1:07:59] prophet of god it's not brother man it's
[1:08:01] christ in him
[1:08:03] a genius that could tell you what to do
[1:08:05] when not to do it he can tell you your
[1:08:07] name where you from and everything else
[1:08:10] super
[1:08:12] super power nothing would stop whether
[1:08:14] storms needed to be stopped where bulls
[1:08:16] needed to be stopped or storms need to
[1:08:18] be stopped he could just speak the word
[1:08:21] and it was beyond there's something
[1:08:23] super
[1:08:24] yeah
[1:08:25] but they don't want that because they
[1:08:27] got to change their wicked ways
[1:08:30] they rejected what they were really
[1:08:32] thirsting for
[1:08:34] russia they reject what they're really
[1:08:35] thirsty all of the world rejecting what
[1:08:37] they're really thirsting for
[1:08:39] what they really need should i say
[1:08:42] they're thirsting because god put that
[1:08:44] thirst in there
[1:08:46] but they're just satisfied with the
[1:08:47] wrong thing don't they
[1:08:49] so where have we come to let's look at
[1:08:51] some of the prophecies here first of all
[1:08:54] amen look at here let me show you
[1:08:56] politics is at the end

[1:09:04] show me today the nation this nation is
[1:09:07] the worst in the world for corruption
[1:09:09] and ungodliness
[1:09:11] oh my

[1:09:16] guess i don't know of a universal what

[1:09:48] there like that and you've never seen
[1:09:50] shorts and stuff like that in russia
[1:09:52] unfortunately that's different today in
[1:09:54] there right
[1:09:55] but at that time they were more holy
[1:09:57] than what we were we were claiming to be
[1:09:58] a christian nation
[1:10:00] ma

[1:14:59] where you don't have to get judged you
[1:15:01] don't have to have a 60 60 votes for a
[1:15:03] supreme court justice they decided and
[1:15:05] it was under harry reid he decided you
[1:15:07] know we're going to change this

[1:15:11] and vote and so forth and guess what
[1:15:15] you realize this money was mostly harry
[1:15:17] reid's harry reid's
[1:15:20] it was democrats fault that we got so
[1:15:22] many good conservative judges in
[1:15:25] because they changed the rules
[1:15:27] and then when come trump's time all
[1:15:29] these openings came up and we only
[1:15:31] needed the one majority
[1:15:33] because they did it
[1:15:35] thank god for a little bit of light
[1:15:38] huh just a little bit
[1:15:42] amen all right
[1:15:45] now i noticed i say a little bit but
[1:15:47] it's totally gone i mean it comes ain't
[1:15:49] gonna make no difference
[1:15:51] uh
[1:15:52] let me go on sorry all right so he says
[1:15:55] all sales and no anchor politicians
[1:15:57] stand on soap boxes on every corner with
[1:15:59] all kinds of crooked things that the uh
[1:16:01] that the corrupt government man was
[1:16:04] right
[1:16:05] that's exactly what's going on
[1:16:08] one man can go down through here you
[1:16:10] know and get drunk and tear up
[1:16:11] everything he wants to go down there and
[1:16:13] nobody is you know there's nothing said
[1:16:15] but you let a man go down there and try
[1:16:18] it you let a poor man go down there and
[1:16:20] try
[1:16:21] and they'll send him the dependent
[1:16:22] trinity he's talking about a two-tier
[1:16:24] two-tier justice system
[1:16:28] why you can they can murder people and
[1:16:29] if you've got enough money and who you
[1:16:31] are you ain't going to
[1:16:32] jail is that right
[1:16:37] oh my i think you know and i want to say
[1:16:39] this at this milestone we've had just
[1:16:41] had another milestone
[1:16:43] and
[1:16:44] and you all know what happened with the
[1:16:46] fbi raiding trump's residence down in
[1:16:48] florida
[1:16:49] to me that was a milestone something
[1:16:51] that had never been done in the history
[1:16:53] of our nation
[1:16:56] for the present government to go after
[1:16:59] a
[1:16:59] a adversary
[1:17:02] the top number one politician that's
[1:17:04] going to come after him and here they go
[1:17:06] and do something unprecedented something
[1:17:08] never been done
[1:17:10] to me that's a milestone
[1:17:12] because see folks how many knows that i
[1:17:14] think they need a straw poll in their
[1:17:15] convention and all that and they figured
[1:17:17] out who would perhaps take the next
[1:17:19] nomination i think desantis was at 20
[1:17:22] something 30 maybe and trump was way up
[1:17:24] there on the 70s he was way up there so
[1:17:27] in that figure of speech he the number
[1:17:29] one leader for conservative movement
[1:17:32] christians and so forth he's the number
[1:17:34] one leader you know right
[1:17:38] and we see what happened we'll get into
[1:17:39] that a little bit deeper here in a
[1:17:40] minute
[1:17:41] all right
[1:17:43] now so he says now
[1:17:44] all right
[1:17:46] that's right a two-tier
[1:17:48] and then he says corruption low down
[1:17:50] fail
[1:17:54] amen
[1:17:55] forty percent of them homosexual think
[1:17:57] of it sodom and gomorrah again
[1:17:59] oh my it's supposed to be i wonder what
[1:18:02] takes place next aren't that what were
[1:18:04] you and i are doing
[1:18:06] we're at the place where we're wondering
[1:18:08] what's going to take place next when the
[1:18:11] next president comes in god give us a
[1:18:13] good godly man that's what we could say
[1:18:15] the best man that we could ask for
[1:18:18] as good as he can have we just had there
[1:18:21] was a reprieve for how many knows that a
[1:18:22] lot of times the judgments of god even
[1:18:24] in the old testament they would be held
[1:18:26] off for a few years but the judgments
[1:18:28] still come
[1:18:30] probably what we're experiencing a
[1:18:32] little bit of repeat but guess what it's
[1:18:34] still coming it's going to happen
[1:18:40] oh my give us a godly man old dwight
[1:18:42] ellison
[1:18:43] and watch the next thing that comes in
[1:18:44] we might have a rat then the next time
[1:18:47] sure enough
[1:18:50] woo be careful now respect to god you
[1:18:53] know think about it
[1:18:55] you realize
[1:18:56] i looked i i
[1:18:58] i asked siri i said how many catholic
[1:19:00] presidents have we had
[1:19:02] she said we have had kennedy and the
[1:19:05] last and and one more that's bite
[1:19:11] kennedy and vine that's all it said if
[1:19:13] that's accurate it's only our second one
[1:19:16] and he fits perfect what brother bannon
[1:19:18] described for kennedy as not being
[1:19:20] really the head but somebody behind it
[1:19:23] pushing it
[1:19:25] huh
[1:19:26] and even by the even but the brahms says
[1:19:28] now kennedy may not do it and bring a
[1:19:29] lot of these things in but there's one
[1:19:31] to come one that don't know joseph
[1:19:35] and what does that mean there's going to
[1:19:37] come a president don't know and don't
[1:19:38] have one respect for the constitution of
[1:19:41] the united states
[1:19:43] don't know what our forefathers fought
[1:19:44] for listen to jesse bell religion if you
[1:19:47] really want to hear it straight from so
[1:19:48] to speak the horse's mouth but he talked
[1:19:50] about it we have forgotten what we come
[1:19:52] for americans have absolutely forgotten
[1:19:54] what they came for and actually elected
[1:19:57] and made us a catholic country
[1:20:02] we're a catholic country according to
[1:20:04] prophet god
[1:20:06] amen
[1:20:14] all right i deleted that one because i
[1:20:16] had it on here all right
[1:20:18] let's stop and and come back here again
[1:20:21] i'm not going to be in a hurry is that
[1:20:22] okay
[1:20:24] we might have a rat next time sure
[1:20:26] enough but there's coming a pharaoh who
[1:20:28] doesn't know joseph remember that boy if
[1:20:32] we're not seeing that now we we are
[1:20:35] seeing it now
[1:20:37] people
[1:20:40] people that hate the constitution worse
[1:20:44] whenever trump was in everybody was
[1:20:45] we're having a constitutional crisis
[1:20:48] but it doesn't matter what
[1:20:49] unconstitutional things they do
[1:20:52] huh they don't crawl that cried out now

[1:22:32] racism or anything like that during
[1:22:34] reagan and different ones you know
[1:22:36] right up to the obama administration
[1:22:39] the racism started
[1:22:42] in the obama administration
[1:22:44] whenever there would be a killing of a
[1:22:46] black person and so forth and then he
[1:22:48] would go and he would investigate the
[1:22:50] police and want to take their everything
[1:22:51] else
[1:22:52] uh and stood up for the murderers and
[1:22:55] everything else
[1:22:57] and look what we're at today
[1:22:59] okay now you can't hardly pass a day but

[1:31:43] you're a whole lot less scared of him
[1:31:44] than they are you
[1:31:47] i mean they're a whole lot more scared
[1:31:48] of you of him than they are here
[1:31:50] all right i'll get straight
[1:31:53] all right

[1:32:05] confederation of churches we'll finally
[1:32:08] join with romanism to fight uh uh joint
[1:32:12] catholicism to fight
[1:32:14] communism
[1:32:17] huh now how many know all of those
[1:32:19] churches let the pope come to america or
[1:32:21] anywhere that does nothing to all of
[1:32:23] them they'll flock to that pope like you
[1:32:25] ain't never seen
[1:32:26] but the bible says they have already
[1:32:28] went into the ecumenical context those
[1:32:30] denominations are already part of that
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:33] the image of the peace is already part
[1:32:35] of the beast amen
[1:32:38] so now this is what he says
[1:32:40] and pope john paul is called for all the
[1:32:42] churches to come back and they will and
[1:32:44] they'll unite themselves just exactly
[1:32:46] according what is thus saith the lord
[1:32:49] amen
[1:32:50] and the spiritual churches that it's in
[1:32:53] she's now coming to an end
[1:32:56] huh but that was never true if it's true
[1:32:58] now even the blood of jesus christ we're
[1:33:01] coming down to the end
[1:33:04] huh
[1:33:06] let's be honest when we see how many
[1:33:08] things is crept in the message
[1:33:10] probably in every one of our lives we
[1:33:12] could say hello we got to be careful
[1:33:13] about
[1:33:15] because your phone is a very dangerous
[1:33:17] weapon it is a weapon that can be used
[1:33:20] for the devil folks there's young people
[1:33:22] it's not sitting here this morning
[1:33:23] because of a telephone
[1:33:26] getting corrupted by the telephone and
[1:33:27] the tempting hour of temptation is so
[1:33:30] strong hello
[1:33:31] that it takes a genuine new birth to
[1:33:33] overcome what's out there young folks
[1:33:39] amen you got to get on no computer and
[1:33:41] everything else you got to write in your
[1:33:42] hand and everything it's a date you
[1:33:44] better have the holy ghost
[1:33:47] amen
[1:33:49] it's coming too in its end god look back
[1:33:51] into where she started with luther amen
[1:33:53] dallas wesley's sanctification baptism
[1:33:55] the holy ghost now at the end the spirit
[1:33:57] of christ is so in the church it's doing
[1:33:59] the same works that he did right back to
[1:34:01] the head again and ready for the church
[1:34:04] and the bride to unite and the coming of
[1:34:06] the lord jesus christ and the
[1:34:08] resurrection of the dead we're at the
[1:34:10] end i may believe that that's where
[1:34:12] we're at we're looking for the
[1:34:13] resurrection today
[1:34:17] praise be to god
[1:34:19] you see folks i just thought about this
[1:34:21] i think laying in bed last night i was
[1:34:22] thinking you know if you aren't in a
[1:34:24] rapture
[1:34:25] you're not even going to come up for a
[1:34:26] thousand years
[1:34:28] you get to be in your little nightmare
[1:34:30] for a thousand years after you go
[1:34:31] through the tribulation period
[1:34:36] because how many knows that's the first
[1:34:37] resurrection
[1:34:39] the rapture is the first resurrection
[1:34:42] all the deadly christ shall rise and
[1:34:44] every christian that is alive and
[1:34:46] remains into his coming they get caught
[1:34:48] up
[1:34:49] the rest of the dead live not for a
[1:34:50] thousand years
[1:34:53] thousand years because how many knows
[1:34:55] you don't come up to the judgment right
[1:34:57] not to laughter the millennium then it's
[1:34:59] the judgment
[1:35:01] folks i don't want to miss it do you
[1:35:05] no i don't want to miss it at all
[1:35:09] all right
[1:35:10] so everything's coming
[1:35:12] to an
[1:35:12] end then he says there is coming a time
[1:35:16] upon this nation
[1:35:18] to where this nation is going to
[1:35:19] exercise all the power of the first
[1:35:21] beast
[1:35:22] which was before it which was pagan rome
[1:35:25] it become palpa rome
[1:35:28] that this nation will do that
[1:35:30] we're going to go to revelation 13.
[1:35:33] amen
[1:35:34] let's go to revelation 13.
[1:35:42] branham describes now he takes a prophet
[1:35:43] i'm gonna know the prophet is the one
[1:35:45] that can take a book like revelation and
[1:35:46] tell you what it means
[1:35:49] he can give you the meaning of it
[1:35:51] that you can believe should i say
[1:35:53] a lot of people can give you meanings
[1:35:54] but i like when christ comes and proves
[1:35:56] it
[1:35:58] all right
[1:36:00] exercise
[1:36:02] all the power of the first now a lamb
[1:36:05] represents religion the lamb of god and
[1:36:07] remember it was spoke like a it spoke
[1:36:09] like a lamb it was a lamb after a while
[1:36:10] it received power and smoke like a
[1:36:12] dragon and exercised all the power that
[1:36:14] the dragon had it before
[1:36:16] and the dragon is rome always so don't
[1:36:19] you see roman denomination a mark
[1:36:21] protestant denomination an image unto
[1:36:23] the beast
[1:36:24] amen making a power
[1:36:26] that will force all protestants
[1:36:29] like a union and you'll have to be in
[1:36:31] this council of churches you won't be
[1:36:32] able to have any fellowship and it's
[1:36:34] practically that way now
[1:36:37] revelation 13 and let's go with
[1:36:40] uh laven
[1:36:42] and i beheld another beast coming up out
[1:36:44] of the earth and it had two horns like a
[1:36:46] lamb
[1:36:46] talking about the buffalo
[1:36:48] and he spake as a dragon
[1:36:50] and he exercised all the power of the
[1:36:53] first peace before him and causes the
[1:36:55] earth and them which dwell therein to
[1:36:57] worship the first beast whose deadly
[1:36:59] wound was healed amen
[1:37:01] how many knows all you got to do is
[1:37:02] submit to the image of the beast because
[1:37:04] the image of the beast
[1:37:06] is com directly connected to the beast
[1:37:10] image of the beast catholic means
[1:37:12] universal don't it
[1:37:13] catholic means universal world is also
[1:37:17] universal a world council of churches
[1:37:20] all get together amen under
[1:37:24] catholicism
[1:37:25] all right
[1:37:26] dwell them to worship the first beast
[1:37:29] whose deadly wound was healed
[1:37:31] and he go do that great wonder so that
[1:37:33] he makes fire to come down from heaven
[1:37:36] on the earth and the sight of men
[1:37:38] and to see with them that dwell on the
[1:37:40] earth by the means of those miracles
[1:37:42] which he had power to do inside of men
[1:37:44] saying to them that dwell on the earth
[1:37:45] that they should make an image to the
[1:37:47] beast which had the wound by a sword and
[1:37:50] did live and he had power to give life
[1:37:52] unto the image of the beast
[1:37:55] that the image of the beast should both
[1:37:57] speak and causes many as would not
[1:37:59] worship the image of the beast should be
[1:38:01] killed
[1:38:03] now we understand through the prophet of
[1:38:04] god that at some time or other we don't
[1:38:06] know just when or what what deal but the
[1:38:08] catholic church is supposed to bail
[1:38:10] america out
[1:38:11] right
[1:38:13] she's supposed to bail them out
[1:38:15] boy they're sure getting some we're
[1:38:17] we're making something to bail out
[1:38:18] aren't we
[1:38:19] yeah we just did the other day we're
[1:38:20] making a big bunch of bunch more to bail
[1:38:23] out
[1:38:25] but
[1:38:27] give it power see that one will give us
[1:38:29] power to do it so forth and notice and
[1:38:32] he causes all both great and
[1:38:35] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[1:38:37] mark in their hand or in their forehead
[1:38:40] and that no man might buy ourselves save
[1:38:42] he that had the mark or the name of the
[1:38:44] beast or the number of his name
[1:38:46] amen
[1:38:48] all right so we see that it will come
[1:38:50] down to a financial squeeze how many
[1:38:53] believe that
[1:39:10] this is to the
[1:39:12] philadelphian church age because i had
[1:39:15] the last church age before our age
[1:39:17] because that has kept the word of my
[1:39:19] patience i also will keep thee from the
[1:39:21] hour of temptation which shall come upon
[1:39:23] all the world to try them
[1:39:26] that dwell on the earth
[1:39:28] welcome
[1:39:29] to the trying time
[1:39:32] from here on out i would say that that
[1:39:34] trying time is going to get greater
[1:39:37] and greater
[1:39:38] and greater would you like to see what
[1:39:40] the prophet said of how that's going to
[1:39:41] transpire
[1:39:43] only the elect he was talking about
[1:39:45] kitty from the hour of trent
[1:39:47] uh temptation page 3 13 on the church
[1:39:50] age book down towards the bottom
[1:39:52] he says only elect will not be full
[1:39:57] he says the temptation will come as
[1:39:58] follows the ecumenic move that has
[1:40:01] started
[1:40:02] on what seems such a beautiful and
[1:40:04] blessed principle
[1:40:06] fulfilling christ's prayer that we all
[1:40:08] might be one becomes so strong
[1:40:10] politically that she bears pressure upon
[1:40:12] the government to cause all to join with
[1:40:15] her either directly or through adherence
[1:40:18] to principles enacted into law
[1:40:21] so that no people
[1:40:23] will be recognized as actual churches
[1:40:25] unless they're under direct or indirect
[1:40:28] denomination of this council
[1:40:32] i need everybody awake and listening
[1:40:34] very fast
[1:40:35] huh
[1:40:36] a lot of said in a little bit little
[1:40:38] groups
[1:40:39] will lose their charters
[1:40:41] their privileges etc until they lose all
[1:40:44] property and spiritual rights with the
[1:40:47] people
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:50] let that sink in
[1:40:52] until they lose all
[1:40:54] property
[1:40:55] spiritual rights
[1:40:58] now
[1:40:59] can i give you a wake-up call
[1:41:02] in this last bill that they passed i
[1:41:04] guess you know
[1:41:05] they're supposed to have
[1:41:07] 80 billion dollars
[1:41:10] 80 some billion dollars
[1:41:12] going to the irs to hire more agents
[1:41:16] and i've seen one of the strong left
[1:41:18] politicians say we need to give them
[1:41:21] more power than what we just did what in
[1:41:23] the world did they just do
[1:41:26] now how many knows that the department
[1:41:28] of justice the fbi has already been
[1:41:30] politicized
[1:41:33] under even the obama administration we
[1:41:35] they found and caught that they
[1:41:37] they were
[1:41:39] targeting the conservatives for audit
[1:41:41] they're right
[1:41:42] they said hey you can't do that they're
[1:41:44] already back then and now look at what
[1:41:46] they do is why wouldn't they do that
[1:41:47] much for the irs
[1:41:50] and then give them power just like the
[1:41:51] fbi is in the hand of the government and
[1:41:53] so forth and so forth we know that it's
[1:41:55] all already that way isn't that right
[1:41:57] now the irs comes down so that
[1:42:01] oh my
[1:42:02] to give them more power well that's the
[1:42:05] one that puts the squeeze on you isn't
[1:42:06] it
[1:42:08] we're going to come after you we need to
[1:42:09] give them more power so that they can
[1:42:11] come after you
[1:42:14] amen
[1:42:16] how many beliefs that's a wake-up call
[1:42:18] it's a wake-up call it's the squeeze
[1:42:20] they're forming it they're getting it
[1:42:21] ready in the politics and so forth
[1:42:23] putting it into law giving them all the
[1:42:25] power they need
[1:42:29] no doubt they can already confiscate it
[1:42:30] unless you doubt all your eyes across
[1:42:32] all your t's and got everything right
[1:42:35] amen
[1:42:37] so listen to what it says
[1:42:42] for example right now unless local
[1:42:44] ministerial association approves in in
[1:42:47] cases in most cities one cannot even
[1:42:49] rent a building or be have religious
[1:42:51] services
[1:42:52] to become chaplains in the armed service
[1:42:54] or hospitals
[1:42:55] it is now almost mandatory to be
[1:42:57] recognized as acceptable in the
[1:42:59] trinitarian ecumenical groups and as
[1:43:02] this pressure increases and
[1:43:06] it
[1:43:07] will
[1:43:08] i may believe it it will this pressure
[1:43:11] will
[1:43:12] increase
[1:43:13] it will be harder to resist
[1:43:16] for to resist is to lose privilege
[1:43:20] how many beliefs that that's the
[1:43:21] government that we're not facing
[1:43:24] a government
[1:43:26] that the first beast
[1:43:28] when you resist it you lost your life
[1:43:31] is that right
[1:43:33] you would be killed but he couldn't do
[1:43:34] that anymore under luther and so forth
[1:43:36] now it's through smoothness through
[1:43:38] slick and so forth and by just joining
[1:43:40] up with him or even agreeing with him
[1:43:42] makes you one with him i mean you got to
[1:43:44] watch who you agree with
[1:43:46] what you agree with because whatever you
[1:43:47] agree with is what you become and what
[1:43:49] you're partakers of
[1:43:52] and so he says it'll be hard to resist
[1:43:53] because they're going to put pressure on
[1:43:55] you
[1:43:56] and it's going to be pressure for people
[1:43:58] to give in
[1:44:00] amen it'll be pressure for churches to
[1:44:02] give in let me tell you something i'll
[1:44:04] give this place up in the heartbeat
[1:44:06] before i give up what i believe
[1:44:12] it'll be tempting
[1:44:14] dale no doubt no doubt it'll look all
[1:44:16] you got to do is sign here all you got
[1:44:18] to do is be a part of this and you can
[1:44:20] keep on going you better watch that
[1:44:24] amen
[1:44:26] you watch what you're part of
[1:44:29] all right
[1:44:34] now notice
[1:44:38] so he says
[1:44:41] revelation 13 plainly explains the lamb
[1:44:44] coming up out of the earth and other
[1:44:45] beasts come up out of the water
[1:44:47] thickness of multitudes of people this
[1:44:49] lamb come up where there was no people
[1:44:51] amen
[1:44:53] now remember it spoke like a lamb it was
[1:44:56] a limb received power and spoke like a
[1:44:58] dragon exercised all the power that the
[1:45:00] dragon had that's exactly what the
[1:45:02] dragon did
[1:45:03] if you don't comply to us
[1:45:05] we'll take your property we'll seize
[1:45:07] your property
[1:45:08] we'll do whatever amen
[1:45:11] the dragon before him and the dragon is
[1:45:13] always rome don't you see roman
[1:45:15] denomination the mark protestant
[1:45:16] denomination image unto the beast making
[1:45:18] your power that'll force all protestants
[1:45:21] into a union maybe i read this already
[1:45:23] and you'll have to be in this council of
[1:45:24] churches or you won't be able to have
[1:45:28] fellowship
[1:45:30] [Music]
[1:45:32] amen and it's practically that way now
[1:45:34] can you imagine him saying that way back
[1:45:36] then
[1:45:39] and on persons like ourselves we're
[1:45:41] going to be cut out of that all together
[1:45:43] that's exactly right because
[1:45:45] they won't be able to do it it's
[1:45:46] tightening and then when that time comes
[1:45:50] when the press comes to a place where
[1:45:52] you're pressed out then watch
[1:45:54] then watch the third pulled in
[1:45:57] it'll be absolutely to the total loss
[1:46:01] how many knows it was the opening of the
[1:46:03] word the speaking of the word speaking
[1:46:05] squirrels into existence brother bannon
[1:46:07] made reference to on the third pool
[1:46:10] you say well we ain't going to be part
[1:46:12] of that why will we need the third pool
[1:46:13] then
[1:46:15] why we need to speak things
[1:46:16] faith
[1:46:18] we're going to have to have much more
[1:46:19] faith than what we do now
[1:46:21] huh
[1:46:22] now i want to show you where brother i'm
[1:46:24] even proud talks about how that that'll
[1:46:26] be the
[1:46:26] uh you know what causes us to have
[1:46:28] rapturing faith
[1:46:31] okay
[1:46:34] watch the press comes to a place you're
[1:46:36] pressed out watch the per
[1:46:38] it'll be for the bride and the church
[1:46:41] now we're closer
[1:46:42] than it seems to be i don't know when
[1:46:45] but it's real
[1:46:47] real close
[1:46:48] can you imagine brother batman after
[1:46:50] talking about thinking in kennedy's time
[1:46:52] that we're real real close
[1:46:55] let me see what he says here
[1:46:58] i don't know what it'll be it may not be
[1:47:00] me but i may be building the platform i
[1:47:01] may be taken before that time i don't
[1:47:03] know
[1:47:05] he says in that time maybe the coming
[1:47:06] week the holy spirit will come i don't
[1:47:08] know he may be next week he may be yet
[1:47:09] tonight i don't know when he'll come he
[1:47:11] doesn't tell us that but i do believe
[1:47:14] that we're so close
[1:47:16] that i would never die of old age
[1:47:19] yet at 54 years old i'd never die of old
[1:47:21] age until he's here
[1:47:28] where did that put us
[1:47:30] it puts us desperately close
[1:47:34] amen i'm gonna be we need to watch these
[1:47:36] signs
[1:47:37] we need to see these signs we need to
[1:47:40] see what's coming down the street
[1:47:42] and we need to be ready i want evening
[1:47:43] light cabinet i want every one of you to
[1:47:45] be ready for what's coming
[1:47:47] don't cut don't let it catch you off
[1:47:48] guard amen
[1:47:53] i i truly believe i would be the first
[1:47:55] one they would hit with everything they
[1:47:57] got
[1:47:58] huh
[1:47:59] always the leader
[1:48:01] they would come after every one of you
[1:48:03] and i'm telling you it's close it's so
[1:48:06] close
[1:48:07] that they dare to do something that
[1:48:08] ain't never been done before and they're
[1:48:10] getting it ready in the books and so
[1:48:12] forth and they've already already been
[1:48:14] guilty of it
[1:48:16] isn't that right
[1:48:20] i know one thing i'm really watching
[1:48:22] just midterms and i'm watching the next
[1:48:24] presidency because you know as well as i
[1:48:26] do that the way that things have gone it
[1:48:28] should change
[1:48:30] what if it doesn't that's a real sign
[1:48:33] that is so strong
[1:48:35] i've heard people say i've heard i've
[1:48:37] heard said that if if trump don't get
[1:48:38] reelected there will never be another
[1:48:40] republican elected
[1:48:42] politicians
[1:48:46] i'm not sure which one it was but it was
[1:48:48] well-known politicians made that
[1:48:50] statement maybe it's true
[1:48:52] maybe it's not but we're close
[1:48:56] i would never die of old age at 54.
[1:48:58] unless i was shot killed or something
[1:48:59] other way
[1:49:00] just old age wouldn't kill me until he's
[1:49:03] here
[1:49:05] amen praise the lord
[1:49:07] i think he'd be over 100 now
[1:49:09] i'm not wrong
[1:49:11] amen
[1:49:17] i want to say according to the
[1:49:18] scriptures everything has happened
[1:49:20] according to that vision
[1:49:22] i may not do it
[1:49:24] but this message will introduce jesus
[1:49:28] christ
[1:49:29] to the world
[1:49:31] this message will bring christ back to
[1:49:34] the world
[1:49:35] aren't you glad to be in it
[1:49:37] thank you lord jesus
[1:49:44] so is the message to forerun
[1:49:47] the second coming of the lord
[1:49:51] praise the lord
[1:49:54] hallelujah you precious people just a
[1:49:56] little bit of
[1:49:57] politics again he was talking to the
[1:49:59] black people you precious colored people
[1:50:01] in the south
[1:50:02] how you voted
[1:50:04] you say you have no business saying that
[1:50:06] in the pulpit yes i have it's the word
[1:50:08] of god it's a stain on abraham lincoln
[1:50:12] the one that freed you
[1:50:15] i've always wondered that haven't you
[1:50:17] why the black people are all democrats
[1:50:19] there wasn't no democratic freedom
[1:50:22] and it's been proven that they really
[1:50:23] don't help them
[1:50:25] republicans will actually help them more
[1:50:27] than they will but they stay with it
[1:50:30] that's why i don't mind we're on
[1:50:32] national television today i guess as
[1:50:34] long as we're out there
[1:50:36] i thought about not that playing that
[1:50:38] this morning
[1:50:39] let abandoned preachers so i guess i
[1:50:40] will too let the chips fall where they
[1:50:42] may is that all right
[1:50:45] but listen he says to him he says listen
[1:50:47] to this
[1:50:48] the one that freed you laying yonder in
[1:50:50] that museum on a woman's stress and so
[1:50:52] forth and you sell your bird fries
[1:50:57] shame on you
[1:51:00] that's right
[1:51:01] shame on you and you people for politics
[1:51:04] because you're just a good democrat
[1:51:06] voted for something like that and sold
[1:51:08] your birthrights of americanism and
[1:51:11] christianity to give it over to that
[1:51:14] prostitute that run us into this nation
[1:51:17] and made us what we was see she's
[1:51:19] creeping in real easy until now she's on
[1:51:23] the throne
[1:51:25] how many knows now she's on the throne
[1:51:28] our leader is a catholic pelosi
[1:51:31] which is i guess acting president she's
[1:51:33] flying everywhere doing everything for
[1:51:35] him
[1:51:36] huh
[1:51:37] she's a catholic
[1:51:39] i read i did a study i asked here and
[1:51:41] she said there's about 80 catholic
[1:51:44] congress people already
[1:51:46] 80 of them
[1:51:48] huh creeping in
[1:51:50] i read another place he says every one
[1:51:53] in five americans are catholic
[1:51:55] [Music]
[1:51:56] one a
[1:51:58] five a fifth i guess could that be a
[1:51:59] fifth one a five that's a lot
[1:52:02] amen
[1:52:04] he used to we didn't have all of that
[1:52:06] now we got it on the throne
[1:52:08] and you and i are experiencing the only
[1:52:10] second catholic president that's there
[1:52:14] and don't they want to change the
[1:52:16] filibuster
[1:52:18] so that they can do whatever they want
[1:52:22] that's what that's the goal is do
[1:52:23] whatever
[1:52:24] they want
[1:52:26] amen
[1:52:28] my
[1:52:29] and how does it happen
[1:52:31] through a crooked loading
[1:52:35] through crooked voting
[1:52:37] amen
[1:52:38] that's a lot for me to say but i believe
[1:52:41] it
[1:52:42] i believe it
[1:52:47] it's sad isn't it that when people tell
[1:52:50] you one thing
[1:52:51] you've got to believe that it's exactly
[1:52:53] the opposite
[1:52:57] amen look at catholicism swallowing up
[1:53:01] swallowing them up swallowing up
[1:53:03] huh
[1:53:05] isn't that exactly what's going on up
[1:53:06] there they're swallowing this division
[1:53:08] up swallowing that department up
[1:53:10] swallowing this department up they're
[1:53:12] swallowing up everything they can
[1:53:15] and all i can say is
[1:53:17] swallow some more
[1:53:18] keep swallowing you can have it all
[1:53:21] because we're getting out of here
[1:53:23] because i know maybe wednesday we'll
[1:53:25] talk about the judgment of the great
[1:53:27] how many knows there's a judgment coming
[1:53:30] for all of that they're not getting by
[1:53:31] with it
[1:53:32] amen
[1:53:36] what are we going to do as missionaries
[1:53:38] going out younger trying to liberate
[1:53:39] south america and all over the world
[1:53:41] tommy osbourne and them trying to get
[1:53:43] people out of paganism
[1:53:45] and they can point their finger right
[1:53:47] back at our elected leader the same
[1:53:48] thing what's going to happen to this
[1:53:50] world he says
[1:53:51] it should shake every person in here
[1:53:57] how are we going to answer what's the
[1:53:58] missionary going to say to them you come
[1:54:00] here to liberate us from this
[1:54:02] when your own people put the very same
[1:54:04] thing in office on the throne
[1:54:09] we're now a pagan country once
[1:54:11] it's ever seen can we say ever since uh
[1:54:14] kennedy amen
[1:54:16] look back in the pages of history turn
[1:54:18] it back it's absolutely almost
[1:54:19] unconstitutional for to do it they would
[1:54:22] do it years ago we sold our christian
[1:54:25] rights to politics that's how the devil
[1:54:28] weaved himself in a ab was nothing but a
[1:54:30] figurehead to jezebel
[1:54:32] and that's all this will be can we say
[1:54:35] that's all this is
[1:54:37] that's right
[1:54:38] isn't it weird that even our even our
[1:54:41] fox news and different or says who's
[1:54:43] who's really running things around hey
[1:54:44] would somebody might tell me who's wrong
[1:54:48] well i got news for you i can tell you
[1:54:50] who's running things the catholic church
[1:54:52] is running things
[1:54:53] the pope is running things
[1:54:57] without going too far too much but how
[1:54:58] many knows that
[1:55:01] the catholicism holds the gold of the
[1:55:03] world
[1:55:05] they hold the goal of the world the jews
[1:55:07] hold the bonds
[1:55:08] and that right one day
[1:55:13] they'll make a pact and in the middle of
[1:55:15] the tribulation period they'll break
[1:55:16] that back amen
[1:55:19] but they hold the gold of the world how
[1:55:20] many knows those who hold the money
[1:55:23] give the orders
[1:55:25] amen those are the ones that rule
[1:55:28] all right nothing but jezebel brother
[1:55:30] van says ahab with nothing but a
[1:55:32] figurehead to jezebel that's exactly
[1:55:34] right picture constance you christians
[1:55:36] wake yourself up it's later than you
[1:55:39] think
[1:55:40] the conditions that we're in and how to
[1:55:43] let themselves get that way
[1:55:45] oh he says do you watch the wave of sin
[1:55:48] come in now amen
[1:55:50] oh my
[1:55:52] notice he'll conquer and almost has in
[1:55:54] his grip right now
[1:55:56] i wrote there
[1:55:57] another prophecy
[1:55:59] as we see this we see that it's almost
[1:56:01] in his grip right now
[1:56:06] amen just how is this going to happen is
[1:56:09] a little bit more evident
[1:56:12] but it'll be about your money they're
[1:56:14] going to try to make you do what you
[1:56:15] they want you to do
[1:56:16] because of that mighty benjamin friend

[1:56:20] hope you have a benjamin franklin i
[1:56:22] probably only have a george washington
[1:56:27] but because of money hello

[1:56:31] to lose everything
[1:56:33] folks i don't know about you but when it
[1:56:34] comes down to that you can have it i'll
[1:56:36] find me a nice little cave or somewhere
[1:56:37] if i have to
[1:56:38] because i know god will bring a black
[1:56:41] bird around and have me a nice ham
[1:56:43] sandwich or something
[1:56:45] i mean it's got faith to believe that
[1:56:46] god's gonna take he says now the third
[1:56:48] pull we'll maybe preach on the third
[1:56:50] pull here soon but he says about the
[1:56:51] third pool is not gonna happen right now

[1:56:57] that third pull then
[1:57:02] how many believe we got to love one
[1:57:03] another we ought to be tied folks
[1:57:05] because if we are now we will be then
[1:57:08] we will need each other we will love
[1:57:10] each other
[1:57:11] we'll love god amen
[1:57:13] but it's important to do it now
[1:57:16] oh my
[1:57:18] almost has in his grip right now while
[1:57:20] he's still antichrist before he becomes
[1:57:22] incarnate beast how many and i could go
[1:57:25] through the scriptures won't take the
[1:57:26] time this morning we talked about woe to
[1:57:28] the inhabitants of the earth when that
[1:57:30] the beast come up to you

[1:57:46] about cruel punishment you just wait
[1:57:49] watch what them that's left here on
[1:57:51] earth will have to go through with
[1:57:54] there will be weeping and wailing and
[1:57:56] gnashing of teeth
[1:57:58] for the dragon rome spurted out water
[1:58:00] out of his mouth to make war with the
[1:58:02] remnant of the woman's seed
[1:58:05] huh wasn't you a message believer
[1:58:08] did you follow that prophet
[1:58:10] huh
[1:58:14] oh my
[1:58:17] that was left upon the earth after the
[1:58:19] bride had been selected and took out and
[1:58:21] that dragon made war with the remnant
[1:58:23] that did not want to come in it was
[1:58:25] hunted down another place he was says
[1:58:28] hunted down and killed like dogs
[1:58:30] huh
[1:58:32] killed hunted down and killed
[1:58:36] mine
[1:58:38] i believe if i'm not wrong i think most
[1:58:40] of you message believers that's been
[1:58:42] around here for a bit of time know he
[1:58:44] talked about those that if you don't
[1:58:46] make the rapture in order for you to
[1:58:49] even be saved don't even come up
[1:58:51] up until after that resurrection it'll
[1:58:53] be in somewhere after the resurrection
[1:58:56] or after the millennium in the judgment
[1:58:58] not the rapture part
[1:59:00] but it's foolish virgins and so forth
[1:59:02] those that actually give their lives
[1:59:04] amen let's hunt it down the real church
[1:59:06] will go through that the real church
[1:59:08] will go through that
[1:59:10] now aren't you glad i don't just stop
[1:59:12] there can i read the rest of it
[1:59:14] should i you want me to read some more
[1:59:17] i don't want to hear that the real
[1:59:18] church go through that
[1:59:20] if it was possible
[1:59:24] but you see they're under the blood by
[1:59:26] grace
[1:59:28] and it's not going through that no
[1:59:29] tribulation period for them the next
[1:59:31] thing for the church is the rapture
[1:59:35] praise be to god
[1:59:38] now watch at the same time that this
[1:59:40] guy's a conquering god's going to do
[1:59:42] something then too how many believes god
[1:59:44] did something in the middle of all this
[1:59:46] he has done a mighty work in the middle
[1:59:49] of all this
[1:59:53] i'm thankful for it to be part of
[1:59:56] it god's going to do something then too
[2:00:01] let's not just give satan all the credit
[2:00:02] here let's not talk about him altogether
[2:00:05] while this great thing is going on in
[2:00:07] this great system winding up in these
[2:00:09] organizations in the union so that they
[2:00:11] can pull themselves together now to me
[2:00:13] this is another scripture because we see
[2:00:15] the european union and all of those
[2:00:18] all the countries right
[2:00:20] right now
[2:00:21] who are they afraid of and who are they
[2:00:24] trying to persecute so to speak
[2:00:27] or boycott
[2:00:30] wrong communism
[2:00:32] they'll pool themselves together and
[2:00:33] stand against communism
[2:00:36] not knowing that god raised up communism
[2:00:40] to conquer
[2:00:41] them
[2:00:42] i've heard coming right out of the news
[2:00:44] and out of russia saying we'll we can
[2:00:46] blow them up and
[2:00:48] there won't be none of them
[2:00:49] countries and so forth and the union and
[2:00:51] all that
[2:00:53] even america
[2:00:55] threatening that if we participate in
[2:00:57] that war they've got
[2:00:59] some super stuff some real fast right
[2:01:02] threatening even nuclear now you look at
[2:01:05] how much we're giving and the missiles
[2:01:06] that we're giving ukraine and so forth
[2:01:08] to fight them and so forth i'm surprised
[2:01:10] they're not madder than they are
[2:01:13] i'm surprised they haven't thrown
[2:01:15] something at us and you better not
[2:01:16] support because you because they have
[2:01:18] said we are in direct
[2:01:20] military confrontation with russia
[2:01:22] pretty much said we're at war with him
[2:01:25] amen

[2:05:47] there come a time when you'll preach
[2:05:49] people won't be getting saved even
[2:05:50] though we're here

[2:06:26] of life isn't that
[2:06:28] right amen praise the lord
[2:06:33] all right so now notice let me just read
[2:06:35] a quote here in closing
[2:06:37] now look god in his body christ
[2:06:40] christ in his body the bride that's what
[2:06:42] we've experienced now
[2:06:44] god made manifest in christ now christ
[2:06:48] made manifest in the bride how many
[2:06:49] beliefs that's what happened in our
[2:06:51] generation jesus christ completely
[2:06:54] clearly showed that it was jesus christ
[2:06:56] not a prophetess of prophet but it was
[2:06:59] the halo above it was christ in the body
[2:07:02] doing the very same works
[2:07:04] as it was in the days of lot in that
[2:07:06] sociality at the coming of the son of
[2:07:09] man in their right
[2:07:10] and the coming of the son of man talking
[2:07:12] about prophetic coming of christ and as
[2:07:14] god took from the body of adam the woman
[2:07:17] and she fell then god took from the
[2:07:19] body of christ his flesh his body which
[2:07:22] is the word and it's bringing a bride
[2:07:24] out that won't fall by denomination or
[2:07:27] creed
[2:07:29] that is why it's so important that
[2:07:31] thomas byler preaches only the word of
[2:07:33] god not my idea not your idea you're not
[2:07:36] you know it has to be the word of god
[2:07:38] because that's what we're married to
[2:07:40] that's what we're joining within the
[2:07:41] clouds and in the air is jesus christ
[2:07:44] and every word that he's ever spoken
[2:07:46] means everything to us
[2:07:47] and he's bringing a bride out that won't
[2:07:50] fall by denomination creek no sir
[2:07:51] remember
[2:07:53] all we could get into it in revelations
[2:07:54] 18 uh the babylon had fallen had fallen
[2:07:57] had become the habitation of every
[2:07:58] unclean and hateful bird is that right
[2:08:00] that's what we're seeing out there
[2:08:03] but the bride he says come out of her my
[2:08:05] people be not partakers of her sins that
[2:08:07] you receive not of her plagues
[2:08:10] oh my
[2:08:12] i miss a lot i hope every man in here
[2:08:13] hears this tape and every woman will
[2:08:16] understand that see she's the second eve
[2:08:18] she's not
[2:08:19] breaking or spoiling her skirts of
[2:08:22] purity and holiness to her husband
[2:08:24] she'll stay with this word regardless of
[2:08:26] what anybody says you can have all the
[2:08:28] ecumenical consoles they can do whatever
[2:08:30] they want to
[2:08:32] but we're staying with the word saying
[2:08:34] with god amen moves that you want to in
[2:08:36] all the affiliate affiliations and
[2:08:38] they're going to now know this very next
[2:08:40] quote he says and they're going to bring
[2:08:42] a persecution on pretty soon and shut up
[2:08:47] all churches
[2:08:50] amen
[2:08:51] shut up all churches you see that and
[2:08:54] the churches that's
[2:08:56] not in that denomination they'll use
[2:08:58] them for storehouses then
[2:09:00] amen
[2:09:02] my
[2:09:03] and if any man goes and offers prayer
[2:09:05] for anybody else that don't belong to
[2:09:07] ecumenical counsel we'll be shot on the
[2:09:09] spot
[2:09:12] a little hard to believe but that's what
[2:09:13] he said
[2:09:15] my
[2:09:17] and listen that's right like a lutheran
[2:09:20] minister said the head of it said it's
[2:09:22] right here you can read it right there
[2:09:24] he says don't make don't make any
[2:09:26] difference what they say the church will
[2:09:28] stand true to this light
[2:09:30] she's already proved it back under and
[2:09:32] she'll do it again
[2:09:34] how many knows down through those dark
[2:09:35] ages the real church of god they proved
[2:09:37] it
[2:09:38] pressure is good for us
[2:09:42] persecution is good for us brother brant
[2:09:44] says it brings out the best in us
[2:09:47] it's when we have it too soft and too
[2:09:49] nice is when we backslide
[2:09:53] amen
[2:09:54] amen she'll do it again in the face of
[2:09:56] everything of the word let all the
[2:09:58] ecumenical councils and everything else
[2:10:01] who will be gone she's going there she's
[2:10:04] gonna be there without spot and without
[2:10:06] wrinkle she'll stand there
[2:10:09] praise be to god let's stand this
[2:10:10] morning and amen

[2:10:29] watching a little bit more of a getting
[2:10:31] a little closer getting a little closer
[2:10:33] all the time
[2:10:34] and to me what i feel this morning with
[2:10:36] heads bowed what i feel this morning is
[2:10:38] that god if the prophet prophesied just
[2:10:40] like jesus preaches a total loss last
[2:10:42] part of his ministry if that's coming up
[2:10:44] pretty soon where are we at this morning
