[34:14] Amen. Before we go in prayer, just a
[34:16] couple of uh special prayer requests
[34:17] that we want to before the the Lord and
[34:19] and the church here tonight. And Sister
[34:22] uh Janet, she's had her legs irrigated.
[34:24] She's having some some problems with her
[34:26] legs and so she's in a lot of pain
[34:27] tonight and we want to remember her. But
[34:29] the doctor says she is progressing well.
[34:31] She's ahead of where she where he
[34:33] expected her to be. So God is moving. We
[34:36] just ask that God continue. Also,
[34:38] there's a a brother we've been praying
[34:39] for, young man, 37 years old, uh Murray
[34:42] Reeves. Uh brother Glenn, Sister Sherry,
[34:45] I believe is their nephew. Um and he's
[34:47] he was born with spinoipida and he's
[34:49] never been out of a wheelchair. He's 37
[34:52] years old and at 9 months old he had a
[34:54] shunt put in his back and it's given him
[34:57] trouble. So he's got to go in Monday for
[34:59] a very sensitive and delicate surgery.
[35:02] So how many will just pray and agree
[35:04] that the Lord would just lead and guide
[35:06] the physicians as they perform that
[35:08] procedure. So let's just bow our heads
[35:10] and go before the Lord in prayer
[35:11] tonight. Gracious heavenly father, what
[35:13] a privilege it is, Lord, just to be in
[35:15] your house tonight, Lord, just to gather
[35:18] together with believers from all over
[35:20] just to come and bring their little
[35:21] licks of fire. And I just read where the
[35:23] prophet said he bring this lick of fire
[35:25] and this lick of fire and it just builds
[35:27] and builds until it's just a roaring
[35:29] flame. And so, Lord, we just ask and
[35:31] invite you into our presence tonight,
[35:33] Lord. And Lord, we just come expectation
[35:36] tonight, Lord, in anticipation of what
[35:38] you'll do in the service, Lord. And so
[35:40] we know Satan, he tries many times to
[35:42] invade upon your people and upon God's
[35:45] property. And he'll invade by uh taking
[35:47] away happiness and joy and and
[35:50] tenderness and love. He takes those
[35:51] things away. But tonight, Lord, we just
[35:53] ask that you would show yourself as
[35:56] mighty warrior and mighty in battle. And
[35:58] we declare war tonight, Lord, upon
[36:00] Satan. So Lord, we just ask that you
[36:02] would move tonight in a special way. We
[36:04] ask Lord for these special requests,
[36:06] Sister Janet and her legs, Lord, that
[36:08] you would just continue to touch and
[36:10] heal her body. And for this young man,
[36:12] 37 years old and bound in a wheelchair.
[36:15] But Lord, we just ask that you would
[36:16] lead and guide and direct the doctors as
[36:18] they perform the surgery on Monday. That
[36:20] that he will have peace and comfort as
[36:22] he goes into surgery, as he's confessed
[36:25] that he's scared and he's worried, but
[36:27] Lord, we know that you bring peace and
[36:29] you're the great physician. So Lord, we
[36:31] just ask that you would move in that
[36:32] need. be with the song service tonight
[36:34] and each and everything that be said and
[36:35] done to bring honor and glory to you. Be
[36:38] with brother Timothy and anoint him in a
[36:40] special way that he would speak the
[36:41] words of life into our hearts tonight,
[36:44] Lord. And we would receive what you have
[36:46] in store for us. We're a needy people,
[36:48] but we know you're able to meet each and
[36:50] every one. And we give you praise and
[36:52] glory. Amen. In Jesus' name. Amen.

[56:54] sea. Oh, he's the same
[56:57] God who's living in
[57:02] me. I look back on history. Oh, I look
[57:06] back on history.
[57:10] See the mighty
[57:11] God
[57:14] unveil,
[57:15] proving over and
[57:18] over that his word can never fail.
[57:24] But I can't keep on
[57:27] dwelling on some past

[1:20:56] all aside and let God have his way in
[1:20:59] our hearts and our lives. Amen. Is that
[1:21:01] what your desire is? Amen. John chapter
[1:21:04] 6 and verse three, it says Jesus went up
[1:21:07] into a mountain and there he sat with
[1:21:09] his disciples and the Passover a feast
[1:21:12] of Jews was nigh. And when Jesus then
[1:21:15] lifted up his eyes, he saw a great
[1:21:17] company come unto him? He saith unto
[1:21:19] Philillip, Whence shall we buy bread
[1:21:22] that these may eat? And this he said to
[1:21:25] prove him, for he himself knew what he
[1:21:27] would do. And Philip answered him,
[1:21:30] saying, uh, 200 penny worth of bread is
[1:21:33] not sufficient for them, that every one
[1:21:36] of them may take a little. And one of
[1:21:38] his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's
[1:21:41] brother, saith unto him, "There is a lad
[1:21:43] here, which has five barley loaves and
[1:21:45] two small fish. But what are they among
[1:21:48] so many?" And Jesus said, "Make the men
[1:21:51] sat down." Now there was much grass in
[1:21:53] the place. So the men sat down in
[1:21:55] number, about 5,000. And Jesus took the
[1:21:58] loaves. And when he had given thanks, he
[1:22:00] distributed to the disciples, and the
[1:22:02] disciples to them that were set down,
[1:22:05] and likewise the fishes as much as they
[1:22:07] would. And when they were filled, he
[1:22:09] said unto his disciples, "Gather up the
[1:22:12] fragments that remain, that nothing be
[1:22:15] lost." Therefore, they gathered them
[1:22:18] together, and filled 12 baskets with the
[1:22:20] fragments of five barley loaves. 12
[1:22:24] baskets with the fragments of five
[1:22:26] barley loaves which remained over and
[1:22:29] above unto them that had eaten. Amen.
[1:22:32] Luke chapter 24 and 30 says and it came
[1:22:34] to pass as he sat this was after the
[1:22:37] road road to Emmas we know the story and
[1:22:39] they beg they bade him to come in you
[1:22:41] know and uh and ask him to come inside
[1:22:44] and it came to pass when he sat at meat
[1:22:46] with them he took bread and blessed it
[1:22:49] and break and gave to them and their
[1:22:51] eyes were open and they knew him and he
[1:22:54] vanished out of their sight and they
[1:22:55] said one to another did not our heart
[1:22:58] burn within us while he talked with us
[1:23:00] by the way and while he opened us the
[1:23:03] scriptures. Amen. Also, if you wouldn't
[1:23:06] mind, Job 5 and verse 8 said, "I would
[1:23:08] seek unto God, and unto God would I
[1:23:11] commit my cause, which doeth great
[1:23:14] things, and unsearchable, marvelous
[1:23:17] things without number." Amen. God bless.
[1:23:20] You can be seated.
[1:23:24] just had this thought on my heart as
[1:23:27] begin to look towards these meetings and
[1:23:28] and last night with what brother Andrew
[1:23:32] preached I was some places I was kind of
[1:23:34] holding back like no don't go there you
[1:23:36] know how how somehow I know these
[1:23:38] ministers know how it is you know you
[1:23:40] get a thought and a thing and and a
[1:23:42] certain vein and the one before you
[1:23:44] starts getting into it you're like wait
[1:23:45] a minute now you know but that's just
[1:23:47] how God does and so God puts it all
[1:23:49] together it you know it isn't that we
[1:23:51] sit together and we say well I'm going
[1:23:53] to preach this and oh then you going to
[1:23:55] preach that I'll preach this. No, that
[1:23:56] ain't the way it happens. But God can
[1:23:58] bring two men from a total different
[1:24:00] place and and put them together and
[1:24:03] bring something. I believe that'll be a
[1:24:05] blessing this weekend. You know, brother
[1:24:06] Brandon would say say this and and God
[1:24:09] talked to Moses. He said, "I believe
[1:24:11] that the age has come now. the
[1:24:14] miraculous, the phenomenal, the baptism
[1:24:17] of the spirit, power and signs and
[1:24:19] wonders, the great outpouring of God's
[1:24:21] spirit in the last days. And that's the
[1:24:24] thing that brings faith into the people
[1:24:27] that'll take a rapture faith that'll
[1:24:29] take the church into glory. I don't know
[1:24:32] about you, but that's where I'm looking
[1:24:33] to go. Amen. Tonight, I I'd like to
[1:24:36] speak to you on this thought, and I'd
[1:24:37] like to speak to you on the days of
[1:24:39] miracles. It's our turn. Amen. Because I
[1:24:43] I believe that we're not here to just
[1:24:44] talk. Although we do talk about what God
[1:24:47] did in the yesterday and and you know
[1:24:50] 2,000 years ago or 5,000 6,000 years ago
[1:24:53] or or 60 years ago. Amen. But I I
[1:24:56] believe that that same God is still the
[1:24:58] same today. Amen. I believe what he did
[1:25:00] then he was showing us what he can do
[1:25:02] today. Because if you want to know what
[1:25:04] God's attitude is towards something or
[1:25:06] how what God feels or what God looks at
[1:25:09] something, you go back and see what he
[1:25:11] was because what he was is what he is.
[1:25:14] Because he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:25:16] and forever. And I believe we're living
[1:25:18] in a wonderful time. I believe we're
[1:25:20] living in the greatest Amen. outpouring
[1:25:22] of the spirit of God that's ever
[1:25:24] happened upon the face of this earth.
[1:25:26] And I I believe that that the the
[1:25:28] miracles that are taking place, I I
[1:25:30] believe in this building is all kinds of
[1:25:32] miracles. Sometimes we look around and a
[1:25:34] as as Gideon did and he said if God be
[1:25:37] before us where are the miracles you
[1:25:39] know but if we're not careful we look at
[1:25:41] all these other but if we'll look we'll
[1:25:43] see miracles all around us and God can
[1:25:46] take lives and God can take sinners and
[1:25:48] God can take drunks and God can take
[1:25:51] alcoholics and druggies and all kinds of
[1:25:53] things prostitutes whatever and he can
[1:25:56] take them and change them in such a way
[1:25:58] and take that desire out of their life.
[1:26:00] Amen. and put a uh something inside of
[1:26:03] them to live an overcoming life. Amen.
[1:26:05] Brother Brandon would talk about in a
[1:26:06] paradox. He said a paradox is something
[1:26:09] that seems incredible but is true. Amen.
[1:26:12] He said that therefore a paradox would
[1:26:14] be the same as a miracle. Amen. A
[1:26:16] miracle, a paradox when something that
[1:26:18] seems like it just couldn't be. Amen. In
[1:26:21] the knowledge of a human mind is
[1:26:23] altogether incredible but yet has been
[1:26:25] proven true. He said, "Now a miracle
[1:26:27] would be the same thing. For a miracle
[1:26:29] cannot be explained. A miracle is
[1:26:31] something that happened yet you cannot
[1:26:34] explain it." Amen. That makes it a
[1:26:36] paradox. It's incredible, but it's true.
[1:26:38] He said, "But now in the days that we're
[1:26:40] living in, the modernists and the
[1:26:42] intellectuals, they believe in the days
[1:26:44] of miracles are passed. They don't
[1:26:46] believe that there's no such a thing as
[1:26:48] a miracle." He said, "But I believe the
[1:26:50] world is full of miracles." I I tell you
[1:26:52] what, we're about to see the greatest
[1:26:54] miracle that has ever struck this earth,
[1:26:56] and that's the body change. Amen. We're
[1:26:59] not talking about just a temporary
[1:27:00] healing because listen, you can get sick
[1:27:02] today, be healed tomorrow, and get sick
[1:27:04] the next day. Amen. But we're about to
[1:27:06] step into a place, amen, that this body
[1:27:09] is going to change and it'll never be
[1:27:11] sick again. It'll never feel the
[1:27:13] pressures of the world again. It'll
[1:27:15] never feel, Amen, the anxieties and the
[1:27:18] fears and and the unbelief and all those
[1:27:20] things. That is where we are about to
[1:27:22] step into and I I believe we're very
[1:27:24] close to that. But he said, you know, he
[1:27:26] said, I believe that every bornagain
[1:27:28] member of the body of Christ is a
[1:27:30] paradox in themsself. He said, every one
[1:27:33] of you, maybe you was a Methodist or a
[1:27:35] Presbyterian or a Luther and you never
[1:27:38] experienced the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:40] Spirit, you was in some formal church
[1:27:42] that didn't believe in the genuine new
[1:27:43] birth, but has now received the baptism
[1:27:46] of the Holy Ghost. That's a perfect
[1:27:48] example of a paradox. That's a perfect
[1:27:51] example of a miracle.
[1:27:54] Amen. Because something happened to you.
[1:27:56] It changed everything, didn't it,
[1:27:59] brother Tommy? It changed everything. It
[1:28:01] changed your thinking. It changed your
[1:28:03] past. It changed your present. And it
[1:28:06] changed your future. It changed
[1:28:08] everything when the Holy Ghost came down
[1:28:10] upon your life. He said, "But see,
[1:28:13] unless that miracle happens and it
[1:28:15] changes your whole being, it changes
[1:28:18] everything, you're not even a Christian,
[1:28:20] right? There must be a paradox for you
[1:28:22] to become a Christian because no one can
[1:28:25] change a spirit of man and give a new
[1:28:26] birth outside of God. God alone is the
[1:28:29] only one that can do it. It's a miracle
[1:28:32] how God can take a man's thinking and a
[1:28:35] man's ways and a man's life and change
[1:28:38] it from where he was into what it can
[1:28:40] be.
[1:28:42] How many thankful for that grace in your
[1:28:44] life? Amen. He changed your thinking. He
[1:28:47] changed your ways. He changed what you
[1:28:49] thought you was going to do, how you
[1:28:51] thought you was going to be, what you
[1:28:53] thought you was going to accomplish, and
[1:28:54] he changed it all. That is a paradox.
[1:28:58] That is a miracle that is standing here
[1:29:00] before us today. Amen. We we see the
[1:29:03] moon. We see the sun. We see all the
[1:29:05] things God created and how God does
[1:29:08] things. You know, we we we look at the
[1:29:09] sun and it rises every day. And it's a
[1:29:12] miracle that that is there every day for
[1:29:14] hundreds of maybe millions of years,
[1:29:16] however long that God spoke it into
[1:29:18] existence. But not one time do we get up
[1:29:21] worrying about is it going to rise
[1:29:23] today. Not one time do we worry about is
[1:29:26] the moon going to be there? Is the stars
[1:29:28] going to be there? Amen. We're not
[1:29:29] worried because it's God's spoken word.
[1:29:31] Let there be. And God allowed it and it
[1:29:34] happened just as he said it would. And
[1:29:36] that is no different than sea jeans of
[1:29:38] God that God spoke before the foundation
[1:29:41] of the world.
[1:29:44] You're here because God spoke you into
[1:29:46] existence.
[1:29:48] Hallelujah. And if darkness cannot put
[1:29:51] out the sun, neither can darkness of Leo
[1:29:54] put out the light that God has ordained
[1:29:57] in your life to
[1:30:01] live. Hallelujah. But the moon thousands
[1:30:04] of miles from the earth and but it
[1:30:06] controls the seas and and the seas can
[1:30:08] only go so far. That's incredible. But
[1:30:11] it's true.
[1:30:12] Amen. Millions and millions and millions
[1:30:14] of miles and stars and things that that
[1:30:17] are perfectly in order and we people
[1:30:19] have studied it for thousands of years.
[1:30:21] It's a paradox. It cannot be explained.
[1:30:23] They try to but they find out later they
[1:30:26] might be wrong about it. Amen. They but
[1:30:28] it's true. You know, we got winter time
[1:30:30] he talks about and ground freezing and
[1:30:33] but there'll be a little seed down in
[1:30:34] there and that little seed is a germ of
[1:30:36] life and that seed will freeze and it'll
[1:30:38] bust open and the pulp will run out and
[1:30:40] the German life being laid in the dust
[1:30:42] in a frozen seed of ice. How it's
[1:30:44] preserved? How is it going to come back
[1:30:46] in springtime? Could you explain that?
[1:30:48] No. It's a paradox. It's a miracle.
[1:30:51] Amen. You see it every day when a blade
[1:30:53] of grass comes up, when a flower is born
[1:30:55] again. Amen. That is a paradox. It's a
[1:30:58] miracle. Amen. Amen. Paul's speaking
[1:31:01] about the world's being framed and put
[1:31:03] together by the word of God. It's the
[1:31:05] word, God's word. It's a paradox. It's
[1:31:07] incredible, but it's true. Amen. We
[1:31:10] could talk about Abraham of how he was a
[1:31:13] man past the abilities to bring forth a
[1:31:16] son and Sarah was past age barren. Amen.
[1:31:19] It looked impossible, but nothing is
[1:31:21] impossible with God.
[1:31:24] Can we get that in our hearts tonight?
[1:31:26] Nothing is impossible with God. I don't
[1:31:28] care what sickness you have. I don't
[1:31:30] care what sin you have. I don't care
[1:31:32] what problem you have. I don't care what
[1:31:34] issue you have.
[1:31:37] Nothing. Nothing is impossible with God.
[1:31:41] The same God that brought a dead womb to
[1:31:44] life. Amen. A 90-year-old woman and
[1:31:46] changed her back again that a king would
[1:31:49] look at her and desire for her. That
[1:31:51] same God is the same one that can take
[1:31:54] you. You might be broken down. You might
[1:31:57] be full of sin. You might be full of
[1:31:59] unbelief. You might be full of every
[1:32:01] kind of spirit. But there's a power that
[1:32:03] can raise you up. There's a power that
[1:32:07] can lift you up above that old dirt.
[1:32:13] It's incredible. But it's true. Amen.
[1:32:16] How many can say it's true?
[1:32:18] Hallelujah. Amen. It's incredible that
[1:32:21] Amen. And Abraham would take Isaac to a
[1:32:23] top of a mountain after he received the
[1:32:25] promised son and and he's going up to
[1:32:28] worship and and God told him go go to go
[1:32:31] sacrifice him and Abraham didn't go up
[1:32:33] there with a lot of doubt. He went up
[1:32:34] there with faith.
[1:32:37] Isaac looked around and said, "Well,
[1:32:38] here's the wood. We got fire. Where's
[1:32:40] the sacrifice?"
[1:32:42] He started having a few questions.
[1:32:45] Abraham didn't explain it to him. He
[1:32:47] said, "God will provide."
[1:32:51] Hallelujah. Incredible but true. But
[1:32:53] when he spoke that, there was a last
[1:32:55] there was a ram created.
[1:32:58] Come on, somebody. Amen. God will
[1:33:01] provide.
[1:33:03] Oh my. Amen. It's incredible, but it's
[1:33:05] true. But when he went to bring back his
[1:33:07] hand to strike the little lad, the
[1:33:09] scripture said, he said, "Don't do it,
[1:33:11] Abraham." Amen. You've been faithful,
[1:33:13] but I got a ram for you. I got a play. I
[1:33:16] got a I got something I provided for
[1:33:18] you. It's incredible, but it's true.
[1:33:22] Amen. Well, if we think we know what God
[1:33:24] can create, why would we doubt in this
[1:33:26] day that God can still create? That's
[1:33:28] right. He did it in our day. He did it
[1:33:30] with squirrels. That's right.
[1:33:33] Hello.
[1:33:35] He did it with squirrels. Amen. Brother
[1:33:37] Brown brings that. It's so incredible.
[1:33:39] He said, "Here I was." He He said, "I
[1:33:41] saw all this happening." You know the
[1:33:42] squirrels, different ones that think,
[1:33:43] different things that happened. And he
[1:33:45] said it was incredible, but it's true.
[1:33:46] And he goes over to a little lady's
[1:33:48] house. Had it right. And and she's
[1:33:50] sitting there and she got these two boys
[1:33:52] and he said, "If they'll excuse me for
[1:33:53] saying this, they were renegades,
[1:33:56] boys of the world." Little woman sitting
[1:33:58] there and said, "Hatty, the Lord God,
[1:33:59] you said right there, he provided them
[1:34:01] squirrels. He's Jehovah Gyra." And
[1:34:04] something on the inside of her welled up
[1:34:06] and said, "That's nothing but the
[1:34:08] truth."
[1:34:10] Amen. She said the right thing. Amen.
[1:34:13] And it caused something to happen. He
[1:34:15] said, he said, just think about it. As
[1:34:17] dirty and filthy as we are, who who is
[1:34:20] he that sits back yonder or beyond the
[1:34:22] moon and stars, space and time and
[1:34:24] eternity, that even the angels are dirty
[1:34:26] in his sight? Who are we? But a woman
[1:34:29] said the right thing
[1:34:33] that calls the heart of Jehovah and
[1:34:34] said, "You test ask her what she want
[1:34:37] and I'll give it to you." He said,
[1:34:38] "That's incredible, but it's true.
[1:34:42] She could ask for a lot of things. She
[1:34:43] was a poor woman. He said, "If you ask
[1:34:45] for a million dollars, it'll be sitting
[1:34:47] here. If you ask for the healing of your
[1:34:49] sister, it'll happen.
[1:34:52] But she wanted something that was more
[1:34:53] than just a temporary satisfaction."
[1:34:59] Hallelujah. Is there somebody here that
[1:35:01] wants something more than just a
[1:35:03] temporary satisfaction? Amen. But we
[1:35:06] want something that's eternal and has
[1:35:09] eternal value.
[1:35:13] She said, "I want the salvation of my
[1:35:15] two boys." And God gave her her desire.
[1:35:20] [Applause]
[1:35:23] I'm about to read a script. I'm about to
[1:35:24] read a quote, excuse me, a quote where
[1:35:26] brother said, "If God meets a man on one
[1:35:28] certain term and the same another man
[1:35:30] meets that same terms and God doesn't
[1:35:32] heal him like he did the first one, he
[1:35:34] said he's he's not he's a liar." Well,
[1:35:37] you I'll read it in a minute. Right.
[1:35:43] He said, "Well, I I ain't worthy enough.
[1:35:44] I I I don't know. I got a lot of
[1:35:47] faults." And brother B just address
[1:35:48] that. He says, "As dirty and filthy as
[1:35:50] we are, it ain't dependent upon our
[1:35:52] righteousness.
[1:35:54] It's dependent upon the righteousness of
[1:35:56] our lamb.
[1:35:58] And we have a righteous lamb. We have a
[1:36:00] righteous sacrifice.
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:04] So if you meet the same terms that
[1:36:06] Hattie Wright meant,
[1:36:10] God will do the same thing for you. I've
[1:36:12] seen it happen,
[1:36:15] right,
[1:36:16] Brother Joe? We We can testify. Probably
[1:36:19] already told it here. One of us have,
[1:36:20] but Amen. There was a little girl about
[1:36:22] 16 years old come up to an altar.
[1:36:24] Brother Wayne Lawson was ministering on
[1:36:26] a Wednesday night. And she came up to
[1:36:29] the altar and she said, "I want my
[1:36:30] brother back."
[1:36:32] I want our family back together. Amen.
[1:36:35] Those words begin to go into an
[1:36:37] atmosphere somewhere and it begin to
[1:36:39] move in in the supernatural realm. You
[1:36:42] say, "Well, that's hard to believe."
[1:36:43] It's incredible, but it's true.
[1:36:46] Amen. It went all the way over about
[1:36:47] five or six miles as a crow flies. And
[1:36:50] it landed on a little backsliden boy,
[1:36:53] been in drugs, been in a rock band, been
[1:36:55] in a college sing. And he's laying in
[1:36:57] his bed. All of a sudden, he wakes up
[1:37:00] and he said, "My mom ain't home. My
[1:37:02] dad's almost 11:30. We having a prayer
[1:37:03] line. We was having some church. On a
[1:37:06] Wednesday night.
[1:37:09] Hallelujah. Amen. Here he was. My mom
[1:37:11] and daddy. I ain't heard them. Come on.
[1:37:12] Goes in there and checks them. They
[1:37:13] ain't in there. Sister ain't home. He
[1:37:15] gets all tore up nervous. He gets in his
[1:37:17] car and it's raining. It's raining like
[1:37:19] crazy. You thought today was something.
[1:37:21] It's
[1:37:22] raining. He driving like a maniac cuz
[1:37:25] now he's got a fear. I done missed the
[1:37:26] rapture.
[1:37:29] God knows how to get you.
[1:37:31] and he goes over to another brother's
[1:37:33] house. He ain't home. Now, what would
[1:37:36] have happened if that brother had just
[1:37:37] came up with some excuse of not going to
[1:37:39] church that night and he'd have been
[1:37:40] home?
[1:37:43] You don't know when God's going to use
[1:37:44] you.
[1:37:46] It might be just you getting dressed on
[1:37:48] a Wednesday night when you've been all
[1:37:49] stressed out, tore up, tangled up with
[1:37:52] the work and everything else. But you
[1:37:53] say, "I as for me in my house, I'm going
[1:37:56] to go to the house of God. I'm going to
[1:37:58] worship him whether I feel like it or
[1:37:59] not.
[1:38:01] I don't care if it's rain and storm and
[1:38:03] hailing. I am going to the house of God.
[1:38:08] Goes to he go and he said, "Well, I got
[1:38:10] to go to church." And he comes flying
[1:38:12] down this little trail we used to have
[1:38:13] our church on. We've moved since. And
[1:38:15] and he's flying down. He runs off and
[1:38:17] tears up about 100 foot of fence. Tears
[1:38:19] up his transmission.
[1:38:22] Pokes a hole in it. It limps in the
[1:38:24] church, dies in the parking lot. There's
[1:38:26] a brother out on the porch. He's rocking
[1:38:28] a baby cuz it's almost midnight.
[1:38:30] and he sees this
[1:38:32] struggle and his boy still in his
[1:38:35] pajamas.
[1:38:39] He didn't care.
[1:38:44] Amen. I trust some of you can get to the
[1:38:46] point you don't care about what anybody
[1:38:48] thinks.
[1:38:51] You don't care if somebody says
[1:38:53] something or if somebody puts it on
[1:38:54] Facebook. I could care less.
[1:38:58] I got to get to my Jesus.
[1:39:01] He realized, I still have a chance. And
[1:39:04] he pull falls out of that truck and he
[1:39:06] begins to scream out, I still got a
[1:39:08] chance. I still got a chance. And he
[1:39:11] starts coming to the house of God.
[1:39:13] Within about 20 minutes of that little
[1:39:15] girl speaking it, that boy came in the
[1:39:17] back door and gave his heart to Jesus
[1:39:19] Christ.
[1:39:25] That's been about eight years ago and
[1:39:28] he's still serving God
[1:39:33] today. If God will do it for Hattie and
[1:39:36] he'll do it for a 16-year-old girl, God
[1:39:38] can do it for you,
[1:39:42] too. It's a paradox, but it's your turn
[1:39:45] to have a miracle. It's your turn for
[1:39:48] God to move on your behalf.
[1:39:56] We can talk about Noah's turn. We can
[1:39:59] talk about all kinds of people's turn.
[1:40:00] We can talk about the Hebrew children's
[1:40:02] turn. That's right. Came their time one
[1:40:06] time. But they had to
[1:40:08] recognize I, you know, king, do whatever
[1:40:10] you want to do. But as for me, I ain't
[1:40:12] going to bend my knee to that idol.
[1:40:16] Come on, man.
[1:40:21] I'll tell you what happened. I'll just
[1:40:23] drop it in here for a moment. Brother
[1:40:26] brother Tom said we was taking our time.
[1:40:28] So, we just going to take our time. We
[1:40:30] started early tonight anyhow, didn't we?
[1:40:32] I generally ain't longwinded, but I
[1:40:34] ain't going to give you I I don't know
[1:40:36] what's going to happen.
[1:40:38] It's up to him. All I know is one day I
[1:40:41] was speaking on this at brother Ron
[1:40:43] Spencer's and I was speaking about the
[1:40:45] man there three Hebrew children and I
[1:40:47] walked out in front of his pullpit
[1:40:49] walked away from my iPad. I didn't at
[1:40:51] that time I didn't have a watch on.
[1:40:52] Don't have one tonight but I didn't have
[1:40:54] even have a eye eyew watch at that
[1:40:56] moment that could operate this thing and
[1:40:58] it went black and I'd been preaching on
[1:41:00] these three three Hebrew children. And I
[1:41:04] walk around the front and I'm and I'm in
[1:41:06] the middle of a I'm I'm in the middle of
[1:41:08] a storm. My mom is having her brain
[1:41:10] bleeds and she's she's uh in in and out
[1:41:12] of the hospital just a would actually
[1:41:14] end up being the last few moments or mo
[1:41:16] months of her life. It's in June and I
[1:41:19] she would pass away there in August but
[1:41:22] she'd been in and out of the hospital
[1:41:23] and things with seizures and more brain
[1:41:25] bleeds and all kind of stuff is
[1:41:26] happening and I'm looking for God and I
[1:41:28] I'm preaching on a God who answers.
[1:41:30] Right. Come on, buddy. And I and I and I
[1:41:33] was speaking about this and I said and I
[1:41:34] just began to demonstrate. It was
[1:41:36] brother Brandonwood. He said he said
[1:41:37] that Wormwood came up and Michael came
[1:41:40] up and and he said, "This ain't your
[1:41:41] job. It's a job for me." And he said,
[1:41:43] "Hey, grabbed a zigzag of lightning and
[1:41:45] a thundercloud and down into the fire he
[1:41:48] went." And I said these words and he
[1:41:51] came down. And at that moment, amen, I
[1:41:54] hear something. I'm looking around and
[1:41:56] I'm like, "What is happening?" And I
[1:41:57] hear a voice speaking and I realize it
[1:41:59] ain't me talking no more. What's
[1:42:00] talking? And I look around and my iPad
[1:42:02] had come back
[1:42:05] on a few moments before. Incredible but
[1:42:07] true, right? He was sitting right back
[1:42:09] there. Amen. I My iPad came back on.
[1:42:12] Brother Ron P kind of nudged Andrew and
[1:42:14] said, "The angel of the Lord standing at
[1:42:15] the pull
[1:42:17] pit. It went through my I didn't even
[1:42:19] have the table pulled. I'd closed up all
[1:42:21] those ads." But it pulled it up.
[1:42:24] went down through the list of tapes and
[1:42:26] and pushed play. All right. Incredible
[1:42:29] but true. I was there.
[1:42:32] And the voice of the prophet began to
[1:42:34] boom out all over that building. Some in
[1:42:35] the back. It was in the vestiel thought
[1:42:37] they had it over the over the speakers
[1:42:39] and it began to boom out and it began to
[1:42:41] speak. It says that's the favorite of
[1:42:43] all the hymns. He said uh Cluth Bill
[1:42:47] what's his name? Huh? Booth Clifford. He
[1:42:50] wrote this he wrote this song in a corn
[1:42:53] field. He said, "I love it because it
[1:42:55] expresses the extreme deity of the Lord
[1:42:58] Jesus Christ, especially in the day that
[1:43:01] we're living in."
[1:43:04] I didn't even catch what was happening
[1:43:06] at that moment, but I would go back and
[1:43:08] I would realize he I thought I thought
[1:43:10] at that moment it must have been, you
[1:43:11] know, I think come to only believe it
[1:43:12] was the first one, but I realized that
[1:43:14] was Paul Raider and and that wasn't him.
[1:43:16] And back and I begin to look what did he
[1:43:18] write? What did he write? And I pulled
[1:43:19] it up. It was down from his glory.
[1:43:23] Ever living story. Just as I'm speaking
[1:43:26] that and it came down.
[1:43:31] It's incredible, but it's true. I would
[1:43:34] go home and I first I'd go to another
[1:43:36] meeting there the next weekend with
[1:43:37] brother Wayne Lawson and he would preach
[1:43:39] on in line for a miracle. And I real I'd
[1:43:43] realized God was doing something. And
[1:43:44] here here my my in my point of view I
[1:43:47] thought well God just he's going to
[1:43:48] raise my mom up and it's over with. You
[1:43:50] know I I was looking for a God to answer
[1:43:52] and he's coming down in the fire and and
[1:43:54] and this is amazing.
[1:43:56] But that ain't the way God was going to
[1:43:57] work it out. But God was still going to
[1:44:00] work it out.
[1:44:02] And here here he is. A I I was to go to
[1:44:06] that meeting. I go home and the day I
[1:44:07] fly in she would go back into the
[1:44:09] hospital and she wouldn't ever come out
[1:44:11] again. And but I would go there in the
[1:44:13] next day or so and she hadn't talked in
[1:44:15] about 17 18 hours. Hadn't made a sound.
[1:44:18] Just kind of staring off in fa in space
[1:44:20] because she had these brain bleeds and
[1:44:22] and the doctors was like, "Well,
[1:44:23] something's happened. We don't know
[1:44:24] exactly." And they were and we walked
[1:44:26] into this ICU room and me and my dad's
[1:44:28] talking to the doctor for a moment. I'm
[1:44:29] looking at her and she's just looking up
[1:44:32] and I walk up I walk up to her bedside
[1:44:33] and my dad said, "I'm going to go to the
[1:44:35] restroom right quick." I said, "Okay."
[1:44:36] And I walked up to her bedside. I said,
[1:44:38] "Mom," I said, "God showed me he's in
[1:44:40] the fire with us.
[1:44:42] He's in the fire. I don't know what's
[1:44:44] about to happen, but he's in the fire."
[1:44:46] And this is the God's honest truth. She
[1:44:47] turned to me and she said, "Down from
[1:44:51] his glory."
[1:44:54] Ever living
[1:44:59] story. Hadn't spoke a word in 17
[1:45:03] hours. But sang the whole verse to me.
[1:45:06] And she lifted up her hand. She said,
[1:45:07] "Oh, how I love him.
[1:45:11] Oh, how I adore him.
[1:45:14] I thought it was over with.
[1:45:17] Come on, man. I thought, man, she going
[1:45:19] to raise up. It's going to be done.
[1:45:20] Brother Tom, it's finished." Amen. But
[1:45:23] listen, he wasn't concerned about her.
[1:45:25] He already took care of her.
[1:45:28] I was sitting on the second pew right
[1:45:30] there as I would be at her memorial. And
[1:45:32] I'm asking God, "Why? I thought you was
[1:45:35] going to heal her. I thought it was
[1:45:36] over. I thought you was in the fire. He
[1:45:38] spoke to my heart. He said, I'm taking
[1:45:40] care of her, but I came down to show you
[1:45:43] I'm in the fire with
[1:45:46] you. I'm here to tell you, saints of
[1:45:48] God, he's still in the
[1:45:51] fire. You may be going through hell. You
[1:45:54] may be going through every tormented
[1:45:56] spirit, but God is with you. Cuz he
[1:45:58] promised he would be. He said, "I'll
[1:46:00] never leave you or forsake
[1:46:02] you." It's a paradox. It's incredible,
[1:46:06] but it's true.
[1:46:13] Amen. We go through all kinds of them,
[1:46:17] but that's what has been released in
[1:46:18] this age is the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:46:23] The power of the word, the power of
[1:46:25] Christ. It's the phenomenal. It's the
[1:46:27] miraculous. It's the baptism Holy Spirit
[1:46:31] that was released on the day of
[1:46:32] Pentecost has been brought back in his
[1:46:34] full power again.
[1:46:37] Just as he poured out the miraculous in
[1:46:39] the first Exodus and the second Exodus,
[1:46:41] he also has poured it out in the third
[1:46:43] Exodus.
[1:46:46] He's the same. Amen. A light would
[1:46:48] appear to Moses. A light would appear on
[1:46:50] a river. A light would appear to a
[1:46:52] prophet in our generation. It's the same
[1:46:55] God. An angel in the first, an angel in
[1:46:57] the second, and an angel in the third.
[1:46:59] Exodus.
[1:47:01] Amen. It's a miraculous. The Holy Spirit
[1:47:03] has been poured out. What is he doing?
[1:47:05] He's gathering a people unto himself.
[1:47:08] Amen. It has appeared. The presence of
[1:47:11] God has come down. The power of Christ
[1:47:14] is among us.
[1:47:16] Come on. A message has come forth and
[1:47:19] it's the same message. Let my people go.
[1:47:26] Hallelujah. He brought him out in the
[1:47:29] first Exodus. He brought him out in the
[1:47:31] second exodus and the third Exodus. He's
[1:47:33] bringing a bride out of a church.
[1:47:37] [Applause]
[1:47:39] Woo. Hallelujah. Amen. Just as Pharaoh
[1:47:41] couldn't hold them when the time come
[1:47:43] for their deliverance, he could gather
[1:47:45] every every person he had. He could
[1:47:47] gather every charity he had. He could
[1:47:49] put every horse in line. He could do
[1:47:52] everything he could do. But he didn't
[1:47:54] have enough when it came time for God's
[1:47:56] children to walk out in victory.
[1:48:02] Hallelujah. In that second Exodus, he
[1:48:04] could put every spirit there. He could
[1:48:06] put every Roman soldier in front of a
[1:48:08] tomb. But he did not have enough. And it
[1:48:11] came time for that body to rise. It rose
[1:48:14] again.
[1:48:16] [Applause]
[1:48:17] I ain't finished there in this third
[1:48:20] exodus.
[1:48:22] He can line every devil up. He can put
[1:48:24] all the anxiety he wants to, all the
[1:48:27] fear he wants to, all the unbelief he
[1:48:29] wants to. He does not have
[1:48:32] enough. This bride is going in a
[1:48:35] rapture. That's thus sayaeth the Lord.
[1:48:44] It's a supernatural working in a
[1:48:46] supernatural people.
[1:48:50] The rapture is for the enraptured.
[1:48:53] That's right. Listen, it ain't going to
[1:48:55] be just one day. You know how the
[1:48:56] Baptists believe? The Baptist believe,
[1:48:58] well, they've told it to us before. You
[1:49:01] know, uh, I smoking a cigarette. I
[1:49:03] believe when the rapture comes, I'm just
[1:49:04] going to throw this cigarette
[1:49:06] down. No, you're just going to keep on
[1:49:08] sucking that cigarette and not realize
[1:49:10] it happened.
[1:49:12] That's what's going to happen. So, it
[1:49:14] ain't going to be that all of a sudden,
[1:49:16] you know, I'm going to be just caught
[1:49:18] up. No, we're being caught up already.
[1:49:25] Hello.
[1:49:28] Seated together in heavenly places.
[1:49:31] Amen. You say, "Well, brother, we have
[1:49:33] the word." Wonderful. But you can't
[1:49:35] separate the word from the miraculous,
[1:49:37] from the spirit of God. They work
[1:49:38] together, spirit and truth. In this
[1:49:40] generation under the third pool, it
[1:49:42] produces miracles.
[1:49:45] Have you ever noticed when they say days
[1:49:46] of miracles are passed, they're not only
[1:49:48] they're not always saying God can't do
[1:49:50] miracles, but the day has passed.
[1:49:53] Amen. That's the devil at work. He can't
[1:49:55] talk us out of what God can do. He'll
[1:49:57] just tell us wait for another service.
[1:49:59] Wait for another day. Wait for another
[1:50:02] moment. This is the time for the
[1:50:04] phenomenal. This is the time for the
[1:50:06] miraculous. This is the time for
[1:50:08] miracles to take place. The third pole,
[1:50:11] nothing but miraculous. There was dead
[1:50:13] fish raised to life. There was squirrels
[1:50:15] created. There were storms spoke out of
[1:50:17] existence. There were tumors that were
[1:50:19] spoke out of existence. Had his boys
[1:50:21] were given eternal life.
[1:50:25] He would say it like this. He said, "The
[1:50:26] days of miracles is not passed as say
[1:50:29] the theo
[1:50:31] theologians." You say, "Well, brother
[1:50:32] Timothy, what are you preaching this
[1:50:33] for? We believe in miracles. about
[1:50:34] message believer. No, all the message
[1:50:36] does not believe in miracles. Message
[1:50:38] preachers are actually preaching that
[1:50:39] we're past the days of miracles.
[1:50:43] Not me. Cuz he said if you're past the
[1:50:45] day of miracles, you're past the day of
[1:50:47] God.
[1:50:49] He said if the days of miracles is
[1:50:50] passed, the day of God is passed. God is
[1:50:54] a miracle. He said when they when when
[1:50:56] was the days of miracles passed? When
[1:50:58] the days of miracles is passed, the day
[1:51:00] of God is passed. for God's miracles.
[1:51:02] Certainly, the days of miracles never
[1:51:05] will be passed. Never was and never will
[1:51:08] be.
[1:51:13] Where was that quote when they was
[1:51:14] studying?
[1:51:16] Amen. What they're trying to tell you is
[1:51:18] they don't have the power in their
[1:51:19] church.
[1:51:21] They don't have the power to walk right,
[1:51:23] to live right. Amen. So, they try to
[1:51:25] educate you in and bring it to a head
[1:51:27] knowledge. Listen, we're not interested
[1:51:29] in some intellectual
[1:51:31] understanding. That's not what this
[1:51:33] message was by about. This message was
[1:51:35] not brought by intellectual
[1:51:37] understanding. It was brought by
[1:51:39] supernatural anointing that was released
[1:51:41] in this
[1:51:42] hour. And I'm going to say this. Amen.
[1:51:45] When brother Brandham left, that
[1:51:46] anointing did not go. That angel is
[1:51:49] still among us.
[1:51:54] That's right.
[1:51:57] He said, "If a man called come," now
[1:51:59] here's a quote. "If a man came to him
[1:52:00] sick and wanted healing and he was past
[1:52:02] the aids of doctors and so forth and God
[1:52:04] called was called on the scene and he
[1:52:06] healed that man on the basis of his
[1:52:07] faith, when the next man call, God will
[1:52:09] act the same way. If he didn't, he acted
[1:52:12] wrong when he acted the first time."
[1:52:15] Wow. So, it cannot be a healer once and
[1:52:18] not a healer again. He cannot be a god
[1:52:21] of miracles one day and not a god of
[1:52:23] miracles in the next day.
[1:52:27] Hallelujah. That means on a Friday
[1:52:30] night, he's still a God of miracles.
[1:52:34] On a Friday night, he still heal cancer.
[1:52:38] On a Friday night, he'll still wipe away
[1:52:40] your past.
[1:52:44] Oh, God called an exodus, a separation
[1:52:48] from where they were at the present
[1:52:50] time. He said, "God is making ready to
[1:52:52] fulfill his divine promise. Where did he
[1:52:53] give to Abraham?" This is in the first
[1:52:55] Exodus. Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.
[1:52:57] Years, hundreds of years have passed,
[1:52:59] but God never forgets his promise.
[1:53:04] Write that down and take it to the bank.
[1:53:07] You might have been waiting 20 years or
[1:53:09] 30 years or whatever. Amen. They waited
[1:53:11] 400 years. But God never forgets his
[1:53:14] promise.
[1:53:15] Therefore, you can rest assure what God
[1:53:17] has promised in this Bible, he's going
[1:53:19] to do. No need to try to think anything
[1:53:22] else. Well, the prophet was maybe wrong
[1:53:24] or maybe it couldn't happen in this day.
[1:53:26] Looked almost possible then, more
[1:53:27] impossible than it does now. Hello.
[1:53:31] He said that first Exodus looked more
[1:53:33] impossible than this does right now.
[1:53:39] But God did it anyhow.
[1:53:43] Man, I could preach for about an hour on
[1:53:45] God did it anyhow.
[1:53:48] I was lost and undone, but God did it
[1:53:51] anyhow. Amen. The doctors gave up on me
[1:53:54] and said there was no hope, but God did
[1:53:56] it anyhow.
[1:53:58] Amen. They said there wasn't no hope for
[1:54:00] my children, but God did it
[1:54:02] anyhow. The devil said they were lost.
[1:54:05] There wasn't a hope. There wasn't a
[1:54:07] chance. But God, rich in mercy, came
[1:54:09] down, and he did it anyhow.
[1:54:14] That's how he does it. I come down. I
[1:54:17] heard the cry.
[1:54:19] Hallelujah.
[1:54:23] Aren't you glad you thought he didn't
[1:54:24] hear you crying when you prayed this
[1:54:25] week?
[1:54:28] The same as the children of Israel. They
[1:54:29] prayed for 400 years. Died generations
[1:54:32] died. Went right on. Seems like who who
[1:54:36] would have thought anybody in this
[1:54:37] building thought we'd be here right now.
[1:54:40] No. The only reason I can think that we
[1:54:42] can still be here, there still has to be
[1:54:44] a seed somewhere.
[1:54:46] That's right.
[1:54:48] Now, personally, I'm say I'm thankful he
[1:54:49] didn't come when a lot of people thought
[1:54:51] he was going to come, you know,
[1:54:55] a lot of people, you know, turned that
[1:54:56] what brother Brandham said was a
[1:54:58] prediction into a prophecy 1977, you
[1:55:00] know, and made that into thus sayith the
[1:55:02] Lord. Man, if he'd come in in 1977, how
[1:55:05] many wouldn't be here?
[1:55:10] But God rich in mercy.
[1:55:13] Listen, he ain't done when man says he's
[1:55:15] done.
[1:55:16] Through all through the time, man has
[1:55:19] tried to put time on God. And God's
[1:55:21] going to come then and God's going to do
[1:55:23] that. You know, Y2K, God's going to
[1:55:24] come. This is happening. God's going to
[1:55:26] come. God's going to come when God ready
[1:55:28] to come.
[1:55:30] Ain't no man can decree it. Ain't no man
[1:55:32] can say it.
[1:55:35] I use one of my dads right now. I know
[1:55:38] when he's going to come. Yeah. Well, for
[1:55:41] what? Yeah, I know when he's going to
[1:55:43] come. You just said nobody knows. I
[1:55:45] know, but I know the hour. You think
[1:55:48] not.
[1:55:52] There it is.
[1:55:53] [Applause]
[1:55:55] Oh, yeah.
[1:55:59] Boy, we need some kind of tragedy to
[1:56:01] happen so we just get right with God.
[1:56:02] Don't you don't got to wait for a
[1:56:03] tragedy.
[1:56:06] Come on.
[1:56:08] All right.
[1:56:09] Well, I I believe I believe it's going
[1:56:11] to have to have some kind of, you know,
[1:56:12] some kind of thing that's going to
[1:56:14] happen and it's going to get people more
[1:56:15] sincere and all I I don't know. I
[1:56:17] listen, if this message hadn't made you
[1:56:19] more sincere, I don't know what will.
[1:56:22] Listen, look at all the pressures and
[1:56:24] and the things they went through the
[1:56:25] dark ages. It didn't cause a rapture. It
[1:56:27] didn't cause people to come together.
[1:56:29] Amen. What was it? It was under
[1:56:30] anointing. Amen. And what is bringing us
[1:56:33] into a rapture thinking and a rapture
[1:56:35] attitude and a rapture Amen. is the
[1:56:37] anointing that is coming down that is
[1:56:39] here among us.
[1:56:44] He said about the children of Israel, he
[1:56:46] said what drove them into their brother
[1:56:48] I think brother Andrew mentioned it last
[1:56:49] night. What drove them into their
[1:56:51] homeland was some political force was
[1:56:53] demonic force. Amen. They come against
[1:56:55] them in the physical realm.
[1:56:58] Come on. The physical realm. He said,
[1:57:01] "But it's going to come against the
[1:57:02] bride in the spiritual realm."
[1:57:06] Amen. I don't know about you, but I feel
[1:57:08] a pressure already. Amen. That spiritual
[1:57:10] realm that's pressing down and trying to
[1:57:12] steal our joy and trying to take the
[1:57:14] atmosphere out of the house of God and
[1:57:17] trying to take the joy out of hearts.
[1:57:18] Amen. Is trying to take you. Amen. But
[1:57:21] if you'll just keep holding on.
[1:57:26] Oh my God. Amen. I was there in Oswitch.
[1:57:30] I walked down those streets. I seen the
[1:57:32] piles of of shoes and the piles of
[1:57:35] suitcases and stuff. I seen it. It said
[1:57:37] it said on the sign in German. It said
[1:57:40] work. Well, I couldn't read in German.
[1:57:41] They told me what it said in English.
[1:57:42] Said work shall make you
[1:57:44] free. Sounded like the devil.
[1:57:48] Work shall make you free. Gave them this
[1:57:51] promise. If you work, you'll get out of
[1:57:53] here. And they worked. They worked and
[1:57:55] worked until they were skin and bones.
[1:57:56] There wasn't nothing left of them.
[1:57:59] Amen. And today, I mean, we got a whole
[1:58:01] whole atmosphere that's come around
[1:58:03] people that want to deny that even
[1:58:05] happened. Say it as just a bunch of
[1:58:07] fables. I I had a great uncle that
[1:58:09] landed by paratroopers into one of those
[1:58:11] things. He said, I he said he to he took
[1:58:13] me to to his side one day and he said,
[1:58:15] "Look," he said, "I don't know." He
[1:58:16] said, "I'm going to tell you, I was
[1:58:17] there. I put my hands in a barrel that
[1:58:20] was full of what I found out later of
[1:58:21] ashes and bones that were burnt in those
[1:58:24] crematorium." He said, "Don't you ever
[1:58:25] let anybody tell you it never happened."
[1:58:28] But I was there and I walked into this
[1:58:30] one building, Brother David. And there
[1:58:32] was this one building. You may have been
[1:58:33] there. I don't know. And there's this
[1:58:34] one building, this Jewish man, they made
[1:58:36] a made a kind of a a monument to him. He
[1:58:38] was on his way to the death
[1:58:40] chambers. He was on his way to the death
[1:58:43] chambers. And all of a sudden, when
[1:58:45] those psalms begin to well up on the
[1:58:47] inside,
[1:58:50] he began to sing with such power and
[1:58:53] such anointing and such such a it just
[1:58:56] enraptured him. and he's just singing to
[1:58:58] the top of his lung and he's headed to
[1:59:00] the death chamber. Amen. And it so moved
[1:59:02] those German soldiers. Finally, one
[1:59:04] grabbed a hold of him and he took him
[1:59:06] outside the gates and he let him go.
[1:59:18] It's time some of y'all made your demon
[1:59:20] that wants to hold you and haunt you and
[1:59:22] try to keep you bound. You make him
[1:59:24] uncomfortable enough. Get out of
[1:59:27] here. Get out of here. That's what this
[1:59:30] bride's going to do. They're going to
[1:59:32] move in such places. Amen. The devil's
[1:59:34] going to get so sick of her and say,
[1:59:36] "You're messing up my Egypt. You're
[1:59:38] messing up my Eden. Get out of
[1:59:42] here." And I'm going to
[1:59:44] go. It's incredible, but it's true.
[1:59:53] [Applause]
[1:59:59] It happened in our day. I remember
[2:00:01] hearing a little story about a little
[2:00:02] boy. It's all over the news about a
[2:00:05] little I believe it was a little black
[2:00:06] boy got got
[2:00:08] taken. They they kidnapped him, throw
[2:00:11] him in the back seat. He started
[2:00:12] singing.
[2:00:15] What singing our God is awesome what he
[2:00:17] sings. So every praise, that's what it
[2:00:19] was. Every praise is to our Shut up to
[2:00:23] our God. Every word of worship is to our
[2:00:26] God. Every praise, every pray.
[2:00:31] Will you shut your mouth,
[2:00:33] kid? God my savior.
[2:00:38] God my healer.
[2:00:42] God my
[2:00:44] deliverer. Yes, he is.
[2:00:49] Maybe that's what the devil's trying to
[2:00:51] tell you right now. Amen. Probably
[2:00:53] trying to tell Sister Donna, just shut
[2:00:54] up. Quit testifying. Quit telling about
[2:00:57] what God has done. Every praise is to
[2:01:00] our God. Every word of worship in one
[2:01:03] accord. Every praise.
[2:01:05] [Applause]
[2:01:11] Shut
[2:01:13] up. Sing hallelujah to our God. Glory
[2:01:17] hallelujah to our God. Every
[2:01:22] praise. Shut up. God my
[2:01:26] savior. God my
[2:01:30] healer. Get
[2:01:32] [Applause]
[2:01:33] out. Them people open the door and let
[2:01:36] that little boy out cuz he couldn't stop
[2:01:39] singing the praises of Almighty God.
[2:01:45] It's incredible, but it's true.
[2:01:48] Oh, come on now. We got scripture for
[2:01:51] that. And at midnight, Paul and Silas
[2:01:54] [Applause]
[2:01:59] sangoo. I'm on a whole different spot
[2:02:01] right now, but let me tell you what they
[2:02:03] sang was Psalms.
[2:02:07] Amen. They sang Psalms unto God. It was
[2:02:10] Psalms 113 through 118 and Psalms 136.
[2:02:13] And if you go look at it, well, we got
[2:02:16] time for a moment. Just bring up 136 if
[2:02:19] you got a moment. Unless I beat
[2:02:23] you. I listen. They was in some chains.
[2:02:26] They were bound. They were beaten and
[2:02:29] bruised. They had blood running down
[2:02:30] their face.
[2:02:32] [Laughter]
[2:02:36] I got the wrong one. Hang on a minute.
[2:02:38] I'm getting there.
[2:02:40] Well, maybe I got the right one. Psalms
[2:02:46] 113. Yeah. Psalms 136 is the last one.
[2:02:49] You know, there's seven of
[2:02:51] them. That's amazing to me. One for
[2:02:55] every church age.
[2:02:59] But old Paul looked over at Silas about
[2:03:02] midnight. He said, "You know what I feel
[2:03:03] like doing?
[2:03:06] Well, I feel like praising praising him.
[2:03:12] Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait. You're
[2:03:14] in chains. You're in bondage. What does
[2:03:17] that matter? Come on, man. The Listen, I
[2:03:22] want you to understand the devil's
[2:03:23] trying to tell you you got change, but
[2:03:24] those are broken chains.
[2:03:31] He done ran out of good chains. Amen.
[2:03:34] God Christ broke his back at Calvary.
[2:03:37] They're broken
[2:03:40] chains. All it needs somebody to get a
[2:03:43] little bit into another atmosphere and
[2:03:45] quit looking at what's around them.
[2:03:47] Don't look at your sickness. Don't look
[2:03:49] at your trouble. Quit looking at the
[2:03:50] fear. Quit looking at the anxiety.
[2:03:57] Oh, Paul said, "I feel like praise ye
[2:04:00] the Lord. Praise all you servants of the
[2:04:02] Lord. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:04:05] Blessed be the name of the Lord from
[2:04:06] this time forth and forever more."
[2:04:10] From the rising of the sun to the going
[2:04:12] down of the same. His name is to be
[2:04:16] praised.
[2:04:21] Hallelujah. It didn't tell you what's
[2:04:22] all going to happen in between the
[2:04:24] rising and the going down.
[2:04:27] There's a lot can happen between the
[2:04:28] rising and the going down and the going
[2:04:30] down and the rising. The rising and
[2:04:31] going a lot can happen.
[2:04:35] Well, a lot could happen between leaving
[2:04:37] Egypt and going to a promised land. But
[2:04:39] he never told him about the Red Sea. He
[2:04:41] didn't tell them about no water, no no
[2:04:43] food. He didn't tell them about a
[2:04:44] desert. He didn't tell him about none of
[2:04:45] that. He said, "I'm going to take you
[2:04:46] out. I'm going to take you in."
[2:04:49] He's the God of the miraculous. When
[2:04:51] they got to Bitter Waters, he had an
[2:04:53] answer. When they got to the Red Sea, he
[2:04:54] had the answer. Bitter waters had the
[2:04:56] answer. No food had the answer. No water
[2:04:59] had the answer. Jordan River had the
[2:05:02] answer. They got in the promised land.
[2:05:03] Jericho had the answer.
[2:05:07] Well, if he had the answer, then he's
[2:05:09] got the answer. Now,
[2:05:12] [Applause]
[2:05:15] I don't have time to go into it, but
[2:05:17] they actually begin to prophesy by
[2:05:19] singing. And they begin to they begin to
[2:05:20] sing. You can read it in there. It says
[2:05:22] they begin to say things like, "Thou has
[2:05:24] loosed my bonds." They begin to say
[2:05:27] things like, "Tremble thou earth."
[2:05:30] They begin to prophesy through songs
[2:05:34] deliverance.
[2:05:37] That's why it's important to have the
[2:05:38] spirit of God moving in the songs.
[2:05:40] That's right. That's why it's important
[2:05:42] to have an atmosphere for worship. Amen.
[2:05:45] Because why? That's important before the
[2:05:47] word comes forth. It's all through the
[2:05:49] scriptures.
[2:05:51] He would send Judah out because they
[2:05:52] were praised and they would give glory
[2:05:55] and honor and many times they would get
[2:05:57] so tore up in the power of God till God
[2:05:59] would just come down and kill everybody
[2:06:01] that they were standing against them.
[2:06:06] He's still the God of the miraculous.
[2:06:10] I tell you what, if you'll start
[2:06:11] praising him instead of your problems,
[2:06:13] if you'll start praising him instead of
[2:06:14] your sickness, if you'll start praising
[2:06:16] him instead of everything around you,
[2:06:18] and you'll praise your God, amen, God
[2:06:21] will come down, he'll take care of all
[2:06:23] of
[2:06:25] that. Next thing you'll know, the
[2:06:27] Egyptians that tormented you will be
[2:06:29] lying dead in the Red Sea. And the next
[2:06:32] thing you know, you'll have a
[2:06:33] tambourine.
[2:06:37] Hallelujah.
[2:06:44] They start saying things though the days
[2:06:46] of miracles are pass. Listen, brother
[2:06:48] Brandham in the third exodus. He said
[2:06:50] they start saying things about those
[2:06:52] intellectual minds set a church in order
[2:06:54] better than the Holy Spirit could. You
[2:06:56] know something, you know that's we don't
[2:06:57] need that today. Days of that has
[2:06:59] passed. He said we don't we don't need
[2:07:01] the Holy Spirit to heal the sick. We got
[2:07:05] doctors. Well, I don't know about you,
[2:07:08] but well, I'm going to stay out of that.
[2:07:11] We don't need the Holy Spirit to speak
[2:07:12] with tongue. We're all intelligent
[2:07:14] people. And when you do, you take right
[2:07:16] from your framework work the lifeline.
[2:07:18] That's right. Right. We don't need
[2:07:21] speakers with tongue. We don't need
[2:07:22] interpreters of tongues. We don't know.
[2:07:24] We no longer need an Old Testament
[2:07:26] prophet to set us in order by the Holy
[2:07:27] Spirit. We understand it. They have
[2:07:29] adopted a man-made system to take the
[2:07:31] place of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, but
[2:07:33] there is a people that's elected that
[2:07:35] has their names on the lamb's book of
[2:07:37] life. They can't go for that.
[2:07:42] They are spiritually minded. Therefore,
[2:07:43] they're not going to go for that. They
[2:07:45] can't stand it. No matter if their
[2:07:46] fathers and mothers lived in that
[2:07:47] organational organizational church, what
[2:07:50] when whatever whatever the church made,
[2:07:52] whatever they want to say, it ain't
[2:07:53] right. He said, "See, they won't go for
[2:07:55] that because they know the Holy Spirit
[2:07:58] is now among them. He has gathered them
[2:08:01] together and he still heals the sick. He
[2:08:04] still raises the dead. He still speaks
[2:08:06] with tongues. And he still casts out
[2:08:08] devils.
[2:08:17] Hallelujah. Amen. See, but people reject
[2:08:21] the light. They reject the Holy Spirit
[2:08:23] moving among them, the moving of the
[2:08:25] spirit, the miracle worker, the very one
[2:08:27] that can heal them, the very one that
[2:08:28] can deliver them. They reject it because
[2:08:31] they think they just turn it off to some
[2:08:32] emotion or or some workup or something
[2:08:35] like that.
[2:08:37] All right. Brother talked about that. He
[2:08:40] says, you know, he's that one of those
[2:08:41] old burnover spots. Yeah.
[2:08:45] Right.
[2:08:47] And he he said there was they was they
[2:08:49] was all burnt over and he said the wind
[2:08:50] would blow through there and they' just
[2:08:52] make a moaning sound. I can't stand that
[2:08:55] song.
[2:08:59] I just can't stand it when brother Tom
[2:09:02] gets anointed like that. He he gets all
[2:09:04] you just get all emotional. I tell you
[2:09:06] what. Hey, brother David when he
[2:09:08] preaches he sweats and he carries. I
[2:09:10] just can't do
[2:09:12] that. and they're moaning and groaning
[2:09:16] and he thought I thought my God he said
[2:09:18] puts me in the mind of of old churches
[2:09:20] that once knew what it was like to move
[2:09:23] when the spirit of God moved once knew
[2:09:26] what it's like and he thought God is
[2:09:28] there any
[2:09:30] hope and it brings him right back to
[2:09:32] Joel chapter 2 I will restore saith the
[2:09:39] Lord and he said I got my eyes off of
[2:09:42] those old burnout Amen in timbers and I
[2:09:44] got to looking down beneath and there
[2:09:46] was some some little little ones that
[2:09:48] was down there bending and frolicking
[2:09:50] having a good time. He said it puts me
[2:09:51] in mind of a good oldfashioned God sent
[2:09:54] Holy Ghost revival when signs and
[2:09:57] wonders come back into the church.
[2:10:00] All those old things moans I don't
[2:10:02] believe in them things. That's
[2:10:03] fanaticism. Days of miracles will pass
[2:10:05] and the wind whistling right down. The
[2:10:07] same one that made them moan is making
[2:10:09] the others frolic.
[2:10:10] [Applause]
[2:10:11] [Music]
[2:10:14] He said, "Let the church squeak and moan
[2:10:16] as she wants to. Let them say days of
[2:10:18] miracles are passed if they want to."
[2:10:20] They're dead anyhow.
[2:10:23] Oh, they say, "Well, we're a church. So
[2:10:25] is them trees." Trees,
[2:10:28] but now the bark is eat off of them and
[2:10:30] they're blistered and and they won't
[2:10:32] pack life up no more. That's the reason.
[2:10:34] If them trees had bark, they could pack
[2:10:36] the life back up. But all the bark, all
[2:10:38] of the rituals they have and all the
[2:10:40] things has made it taken it all off and
[2:10:42] it's just a squeak and a squawk when the
[2:10:44] winds blow. But God sent the wind just
[2:10:47] the same.
[2:10:49] So this little bitty church coming up,
[2:10:51] just a little handful, they were having
[2:10:53] a big time with it while the rest of
[2:10:55] them were moaning. We need God's power
[2:10:58] in the church.
[2:11:01] Come on. We need God's power in the
[2:11:03] church. We need the Holy Ghost in the
[2:11:07] church. I'm sick and tired of man-made
[2:11:10] creeds and man-made ways and man-made
[2:11:12] direction, man-made decreed how things
[2:11:15] are going to operate. I want the Holy
[2:11:17] Ghost to be set free.
[2:11:19] Let the Holy Ghost loose.
[2:11:22] Let him loose. How many can say that
[2:11:24] this weekend? Lord, I'm going to just
[2:11:26] let you loose. Let you come in every
[2:11:28] door you want to come in, move in my
[2:11:30] heart, move in my life.
[2:11:33] That's right. Cuz he said God's going to
[2:11:35] raise a people who believe in signs and
[2:11:37] wonders.
[2:11:39] He's going to re raise a people who's
[2:11:41] got joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[2:11:45] [Music]
[2:11:49] Thank you, Lord. Well, I just don't like
[2:11:51] the way Brother Tommy waves his
[2:11:53] hanky. Well, I'm sorry you don't like
[2:11:55] it, but what you need to do get a Hanky
[2:11:58] and join him.
[2:12:03] Get that arm loosened up a little bit.
[2:12:06] That arm has been hanging down. That arm
[2:12:09] that's been down and fear and anxieties
[2:12:12] and all kind of, you need to start
[2:12:14] lifting that arm up a little
[2:12:15] [Applause]
[2:12:18] bit.
[2:12:20] Amen. Amen. Somebody has got joy
[2:12:23] unspeakable and full of glory.
[2:12:27] I don't know. He gets right right to it.
[2:12:29] It frolics. It dances. It glorifies God.
[2:12:33] Those green leaves are clap their hands.
[2:12:35] They'll have a wonderful time. While a
[2:12:38] what a frolic that little undergrowth
[2:12:40] was happening, having happened. But that
[2:12:41] big old tree standing there moaning and
[2:12:43] groaning. Same wind.
[2:12:52] If we're not care, listen. If we're not
[2:12:54] careful, we'll actually blaspheme the
[2:12:57] Holy Ghost. That's right. Come on.
[2:13:01] Oh yeah. I've seen it happen. Amen.
[2:13:03] That's just emotion. And that was
[2:13:04] actually God doing something.
[2:13:11] Hallelujah. Amen. We had we had brother
[2:13:13] Ram talks about that boy that was in a
[2:13:15] wheelchair that was prayed over and
[2:13:16] brother Ram told him he was healed and
[2:13:18] he told him to go testify. He went
[2:13:20] testifying about it and his church
[2:13:21] members said, "You're making a shame on
[2:13:22] the gospel of Jesus Christ. You're still
[2:13:24] in that wheelchair saying God's healed
[2:13:26] you." Come on, man. You know what his
[2:13:28] response was? He said, "If you was in
[2:13:29] where I was sitting,
[2:13:34] you wouldn't take the hope that I have
[2:13:36] from me." And he said, "But in the name
[2:13:38] of Jesus Christ, I'm healed."
[2:13:42] All of a sudden, something happened.
[2:13:46] It was his turn.
[2:13:51] Amen. Tonight might be your turn.
[2:13:55] It might be your
[2:13:56] moment. Don't let the hounds of hell
[2:13:59] tell you to quit shouting and quit
[2:14:01] praising God and quit lifting up holy
[2:14:04] hands. No. As long as I'm alive, I'm
[2:14:07] going to
[2:14:11] glorify. There ain't no bird going to
[2:14:13] take my place. There ain't no stone
[2:14:15] going to cry
[2:14:17] out. No. No. They they don't have to. He
[2:14:20] ain't going to have to tell the stones
[2:14:21] to cry out. There's somebody here on
[2:14:23] this
[2:14:25] earth. Brother Tom, I know where I was
[2:14:28] sitting. I know what kind of sinner I
[2:14:30] was. I know what kind of lost son I was.
[2:14:35] Bound and crimpled up. Amen. On the
[2:14:38] inside. But a prophet spoke over my
[2:14:40] life.
[2:14:43] And one day it came my turn for a
[2:14:45] miracle.
[2:14:50] Hallelujah.
[2:14:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother R give
[2:14:54] y'all some hope. Amen. For some of you
[2:14:56] lost loved ones, he said a son of God
[2:14:58] can go a long time before he realizes
[2:15:00] who he really is.
[2:15:04] Don't give up.
[2:15:07] When you realize the time is right now,
[2:15:11] not next service now. Not next week.
[2:15:14] Now,
[2:15:17] not not in the right now.
[2:15:21] Brother Tom, Brother Tom Ray gave this
[2:15:23] testimony one time at our church. I
[2:15:24] don't know if maybe Brother Josh might
[2:15:26] remember it better than I do. Hey, he he
[2:15:28] he was there. No doubt, but he talked
[2:15:31] about how he was preaching on speak the
[2:15:32] word. Speak for your children. Speak to
[2:15:35] the mountain. Speak. Said all of a
[2:15:38] sudden the sister up in the balcony said
[2:15:40] my family is saved in the
[2:15:42] [Applause]
[2:15:44] It's my
[2:15:45] moment. It's my time. It's the time that
[2:15:49] God has ordained for me.
[2:15:55] What if Noah would not have realized
[2:15:56] this is your time? He wouldn't have
[2:15:59] built the ark. Somebody else would do
[2:16:01] it. I I'm going to be honest with you.
[2:16:02] I'm glad God didn't call me to be
[2:16:06] Noah. Could you imagine building on that
[2:16:08] ark for 120 years? And you get up every
[2:16:10] service. You think some You think
[2:16:12] sometime maybe brother Tom preaches the
[2:16:14] same thing. Brother Noah preached for
[2:16:15] 120 years, it's going to rain.
[2:16:21] Well, I wish they'd get something else
[2:16:23] to preach. Well, you wouldn't like to be
[2:16:24] in in the days of Noah. It's going to
[2:16:26] rain. It's going to rain. I wonder
[2:16:29] sometimes we ought to get up and just
[2:16:30] say, "It's about to be a rapture."
[2:16:35] Have you made your calling and election
[2:16:37] sure? Have you made things right with
[2:16:40] God? Amen. It's about to be a body
[2:16:42] change take place. This is what Noah was
[2:16:44] getting up. It's going to rain. Amen.
[2:16:48] Oh, there was a lot of them sat on the
[2:16:49] fence and watched the building go up.
[2:16:51] There's a lot of them thought, "Well,
[2:16:52] maybe he's got something. I don't know
[2:16:53] what he's got, but maybe he's got
[2:16:54] something. Maybe he did hear something.
[2:16:56] Maybe maybe God still speaks to people.
[2:16:58] Maybe God still done this. Maybe maybe
[2:17:03] Well, one day the seven went in, the
[2:17:05] door shut.
[2:17:08] All right.
[2:17:11] I I just happen to be up in up there in
[2:17:14] in in Pennsylvania and watch the sight
[2:17:17] and sound there just this past week on
[2:17:19] Noah. Thought that's kind of
[2:17:20] interesting, you know, and playing it
[2:17:22] right now. And and I understand Noah
[2:17:24] types the tribulation saints. There's
[2:17:26] also another type there, the ark.
[2:17:29] They've done a good job with They type
[2:17:30] that ark as Jesus
[2:17:33] Christ and the and the way of
[2:17:36] escape. But one day that door is going
[2:17:39] to close.
[2:17:44] One day the rapture is going to be
[2:17:46] taking place. It listen, it's
[2:17:48] incredible, but it's true. It's going to
[2:17:51] be that there will be one day it won't
[2:17:54] be no more speaking about a rapture.
[2:17:56] It'll be happened. Now, there' be still
[2:17:59] a lot of people on the earth be saying,
[2:18:00] "Well, Jesus is coming. Jesus is coming.
[2:18:01] Jesus is coming." And they missed him.
[2:18:05] But I don't want to be one of those that
[2:18:07] missed him.
[2:18:09] While the door is open, you better get
[2:18:10] in.
[2:18:13] Listen, we seeing prophecy being
[2:18:15] fulfilled.
[2:18:17] We We ain't waiting for a driverless car
[2:18:19] no more.
[2:18:23] No. I rode in one on the way here to
[2:18:25] this meeting.
[2:18:28] Oh
[2:18:29] boy. Yeah. I sat there and watched
[2:18:31] brother Andrew put it on cruise and that
[2:18:33] car took over and that that brother, he
[2:18:35] just been a sit back, do a little
[2:18:37] texting, drink some coffee, and that
[2:18:39] thing drove us down the interstate.
[2:18:46] Brother Thomas, he likes that old man
[2:18:47] truck. That's a nice truck. Don't get
[2:18:49] rid of the
[2:18:55] truck. We ain't waiting on it. No more.
[2:18:59] Just the other day there was a brother
[2:19:00] text and said he got picked up in a
[2:19:02] driver, not even a driver in the car,
[2:19:04] taxi, Uber. He called a Uber and here
[2:19:06] they come. His car drove up, picked him
[2:19:07] up. It's happening.
[2:19:11] I know there was a lot of arguing over
[2:19:13] whether whether that woman dressed in
[2:19:14] purple was a woman, brother. I don't
[2:19:16] know. But I know it's it's either
[2:19:18] happened or it's going to happen.
[2:19:22] Looks pretty good to me. Amen. We seen
[2:19:25] an administration that done whatever he
[2:19:27] wanted to. It It held America in its
[2:19:29] complete sway.
[2:19:33] It's left her in ruins.
[2:19:35] Trump, I know he's trying to put her
[2:19:37] out. Go Trump. Go Trump. He can't do
[2:19:39] nothing. You can put an Abraham Lincoln
[2:19:40] and a George Washington on every street
[2:19:42] corner. It'll never turn this nation
[2:19:43] back around. It's what the prophet of
[2:19:45] God said. So don't be looking for Trump
[2:19:47] to be your savior. You look for Jesus
[2:19:50] Christ.
[2:19:58] That's the only one that can save you.
[2:20:00] That's the only one that can turn you
[2:20:02] around. That's the only one that can
[2:20:04] provide for you when you ain't got
[2:20:05] nothing. That's the only one that can
[2:20:07] heal you when the doctor says there's no
[2:20:09] hope.
[2:20:14] We just seen a pope come into power out
[2:20:16] of the United States of America. Listen,
[2:20:18] things are taking place. Prophecies are
[2:20:21] being fulfilled. Don't be one of those
[2:20:23] that you watch the door shut
[2:20:27] and you're on the outside.
[2:20:34] Prepare for a miracle. That miracle is
[2:20:36] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[2:20:39] rapture. He said, "Give me a church
[2:20:41] ready that'll see signs and see an
[2:20:43] omnipotent God, a great power of God
[2:20:46] moving amongst the people." The rapture
[2:20:47] will be an easy thing when Jesus comes.
[2:20:50] They'll be caught up
[2:20:54] because they believe in such.
[2:20:57] You must believe and realize your time
[2:21:00] is now.
[2:21:03] Moses had his time. Abraham had his
[2:21:06] time. Amen. But there was only types and
[2:21:08] shadows speaking of your time.
[2:21:11] Your time is now. Your moment is now.
[2:21:14] That's right.
[2:21:16] [Music]
[2:21:19] What if that little woman who ended up
[2:21:21] grabbing a hold of the t touched the hem
[2:21:23] of his garment, what if she'd have
[2:21:24] waited just a few more seconds? What if
[2:21:27] she'd have waited just a few more
[2:21:28] moments and and said, "Well, maybe I'll
[2:21:30] catch him when he comes around the
[2:21:31] another corner. I I I'll catch him when
[2:21:33] he comes back through." He might have
[2:21:34] not ever came back through. He was on
[2:21:37] his way to Gyrus's house.
[2:21:40] But she made it her moment. She said,
[2:21:41] "It's my moment."
[2:21:46] Hallelujah. If you can recognize him
[2:21:48] coming through, you can make it your
[2:21:49] moment.
[2:21:53] He might be on to brother so and so's
[2:21:55] house or going to sister so and so to
[2:21:57] heal her, but if you'll realize, hey,
[2:21:59] Jesus is walking through and I got an
[2:22:02] opportunity that I can reach and touch
[2:22:04] the hem of his garment
[2:22:07] and I can have my own miracle.
[2:22:13] the Lord.
[2:22:16] There was a man called blind
[2:22:18] Barnameus coming. He was on the
[2:22:21] street and all of a
[2:22:24] sudden he heard a bunch of noise. The
[2:22:26] prophet of God said just a bunch of
[2:22:27] noise. But he said there's usually a
[2:22:30] bunch of noise where Jesus is.
[2:22:35] Well, I have you to know I ain't
[2:22:36] emotional, brother Timothy. Well, I want
[2:22:38] you be not emotional when you smash your
[2:22:40] finger with with or your thumb with a
[2:22:42] hammer.
[2:22:45] Are you at your one of your ball games?
[2:22:51] Brother Tommy, Brother Thomas said, "You
[2:22:53] say G, I say Jesus, you say Jesus."
[2:22:56] Some of y'all was like, "They can't do
[2:22:58] that in church." But you say, "You say
[2:23:00] Cardinals, I say cardinals."
[2:23:03] Sorry, brother David. I didn't mean to
[2:23:04] get on your
[2:23:07] You say Titans, I'll say Titans. I don't
[2:23:10] know who else is around here. You say
[2:23:12] whatever.
[2:23:14] Listen, I've seen people act stupid at a
[2:23:16] ball game.
[2:23:18] Listen, they ain't going there just to
[2:23:20] sit there and be a spectator.
[2:23:22] [Applause]
[2:23:25] If they're really pulling for a team,
[2:23:26] they ain't going there just, well, I
[2:23:27] hope they do good tonight. I I hope I
[2:23:30] hope I hope he maybe hits a home run. I
[2:23:31] hope maybe makes a touch. I hope maybe
[2:23:33] he makes a three-pointer. Maybe. Come
[2:23:35] on. Come on. No, I've seen them guys.
[2:23:37] They get all paint I'm talking about 50
[2:23:39] year old guys get painted up like a
[2:23:41] maniac. Hair spiked up. All kinds of
[2:23:44] stuff going on.
[2:23:46] Come on. And I'm talking about guys in
[2:23:48] the message.
[2:23:52] But yet those same guys come to the
[2:23:53] house of God and dead as a doornail.
[2:23:57] I'm telling the truth. It's incredible.
[2:23:58] But it's true.
[2:24:01] Boy. And smoke has risen from the
[2:24:07] temple. Mercy
[2:24:10] Jesus. People get all caught up in that
[2:24:12] stuff. And we're talking about little G
[2:24:15] gods.
[2:24:18] Hey, you know, I I enjoy I I'm not going
[2:24:20] to lie to you. I enjoy the recreation
[2:24:22] and those thing, but don't let that be
[2:24:23] your god.
[2:24:26] Don't let let it be what all consumes
[2:24:28] you and that's all you think about.
[2:24:30] Think about don't let just don't let
[2:24:31] that happen.
[2:24:35] And here they are. They're all caught up
[2:24:37] in
[2:24:40] go run.
[2:24:46] Throw a touchdown.
[2:24:49] Shoot a th
[2:24:53] and the next time the next day their
[2:24:55] God's committing adultery and out there
[2:24:57] drinking and carrying on. Listen, if
[2:25:00] they can do that about their little G
[2:25:01] gods, what can we
[2:25:05] do? When it comes to the champion of
[2:25:11] champions, Amen. We're not talking about
[2:25:13] somebody that's got a winning record.
[2:25:15] We're talking about somebody that's
[2:25:17] never
[2:25:18] [Applause]
[2:25:21] lost. Hallelujah. He's never lost one of
[2:25:24] his, but he said, "All the Father has
[2:25:27] given me will come."
[2:25:33] Hallelujah. I'm not here to cheer on.
[2:25:36] Listen, the prophet of God said, "If
[2:25:38] they can get just as tore up and
[2:25:40] exuberant about that, how much more can
[2:25:42] a child of God get glorifying God,
[2:25:45] praising God, get caught up in the
[2:25:47] atmospheres of the Holy Ghost?"
[2:25:51] Come on, somebody.
[2:25:54] Oh my. We're talking about a God that he
[2:25:58] he didn't score a touchdown,
[2:26:02] but he said it's finished.
[2:26:08] It's
[2:26:11] finished. Satan is finished. His power
[2:26:15] is finished. His rule is
[2:26:20] over. It's
[2:26:26] finished. Hallelujah. You talking about
[2:26:28] a God that can save you. A God that'll
[2:26:31] take you and turn you around. A God that
[2:26:33] won't just pick you up one day and drop
[2:26:35] you the next, love you one moment, and
[2:26:37] hate you the next. No, this God will
[2:26:39] never leave you. He'll never forsake
[2:26:41] you. But he'll be with you, even in you,
[2:26:43] to the end of the world.
[2:26:46] [Applause]
[2:26:48] That's a God worth praising.
[2:26:50] That's a God that's worth getting
[2:26:52] excited about.
[2:26:59] And where he comes there's a lot of
[2:27:02] [Applause]
[2:27:05] noise. Brian Barameus said, "Who is
[2:27:08] that?" All says, "Oh, Jesus of Nazareth,
[2:27:10] that illegitimate son of Mary." That's
[2:27:13] all that is. Jesus of Nazareth. I heard
[2:27:16] about him. I heard he healed a leper.
[2:27:21] I heard that he took some bread and he
[2:27:24] broke it.
[2:27:26] And he fed 5,000 with two little loaves.
[2:27:29] Five little loaves of bread and two
[2:27:30] little fish. You're talking about that
[2:27:33] Jesus.
[2:27:34] Yeah. That's who I'm talking about.
[2:27:36] Jesus.
[2:27:39] [Applause]
[2:27:48] He wasn't going to let his moment slip
[2:27:51] by. He said those around him tried to
[2:27:54] calm him down. Say, "Oh, wait a minute.
[2:27:56] You're getting a little fanatical over
[2:27:57] there, Barb. Listen, you ain't the one
[2:27:59] that's blind. You ain't the one that's
[2:28:01] sick. You ain't the one that needs him.
[2:28:03] You must not be the one that needs him
[2:28:05] to come by your way. But if you
[2:28:08] do,
[2:28:11] Jesus have mercy on
[2:28:20] me.
[2:28:21] [Applause]
[2:28:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The days of
[2:28:27] miracles are passed. God, don't do that
[2:28:29] no more. Jesus,
[2:28:33] the doctor said it's too long. It's too
[2:28:35] far gone. Jesus.
[2:28:38] [Applause]
[2:28:39] Amen. The devil says your son or your
[2:28:41] daughter never come back. Jesus.
[2:28:44] [Applause]
[2:28:50] Amen. No matter what they say, no matter
[2:28:53] what they try to do, no matter what
[2:28:55] critic arises, when he comes by, I'm
[2:28:57] going to respond to him
[2:29:02] cuz it's my moment.
[2:29:04] It's my time. It's the moment that I can
[2:29:08] meet him for myself.
[2:29:09] [Music]
[2:29:14] Listen, he had heard about David's
[2:29:16] miracles. He had heard about Samson's
[2:29:18] miracle. He had heard about all kinds of
[2:29:20] miracles, but he needed a miracle.
[2:29:30] Maybe you're in line for a miracle
[2:29:32] tonight.
[2:29:37] say, "Well, Brother Timothy, I've done a
[2:29:39] lot of wrong." We just ask for God to
[2:29:41] forgive you.
[2:29:44] Ain't no 12 day step program. Just
[2:29:47] repent.
[2:29:49] [Applause]
[2:29:53] Be baptized.
[2:29:55] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:29:57] and you shall be saved, and you shall be
[2:29:59] filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[2:30:02] Amen. We done got the tub full. I seen
[2:30:05] it last night.
[2:30:07] There's water. What does hinder?
[2:30:11] Well, I tell you what's hindering is
[2:30:12] that spirit that says, "Wait a little
[2:30:14] longer."
[2:30:16] What it did to the prophet of God. He
[2:30:17] said, "When I was," he said, "I gave my
[2:30:19] heart to God a long time before I did."
[2:30:21] He said, "But there was a spirit that
[2:30:22] hung over me saying, "Wait just a little
[2:30:24] longer.
[2:30:26] If you're not careful, you'll wait until
[2:30:28] it's passed. All right.
[2:30:32] Cuz God only has to call one time.
[2:30:37] Amen. But here he is sitting there
[2:30:41] wondering how is this going to be? How
[2:30:43] how how I I got to I got to I got to
[2:30:47] meet him for myself. I And he begins to
[2:30:49] cry out.
[2:30:51] And the I love how brother Brandham said
[2:30:53] it. Said he's walking on his way to
[2:30:56] Calvary, had his face set, but he hears
[2:30:59] a cry.
[2:31:02] And he said that cry stopped heaven.
[2:31:04] Yeah.
[2:31:07] All of a sudden, heaven stops
[2:31:11] and it turns and looks at him. He says,
[2:31:14] "Go get that one." Amen. And they come
[2:31:17] to him and they said, "But I'm
[2:31:20] Barardmous, the master calleth for
[2:31:23] thee." I love what he did. He took those
[2:31:26] old beggar garments off and he just
[2:31:27] threw them down.
[2:31:30] Throw them over there cuz he knew once
[2:31:32] he got to Jesus, he wasn't going to need
[2:31:34] them no more.
[2:31:37] [Music]
[2:31:40] Hallelujah. I trust there can be some
[2:31:42] throwing down of some things this
[2:31:43] weekend. I trust you can throw down
[2:31:45] bitterness and unforgiveness and
[2:31:47] resentment and spirits that wants to
[2:31:49] hold you and wants to bind you. I trust
[2:31:51] you can just throw them down. Say, "I
[2:31:53] have to get to Jesus.
[2:31:59] Only he can touch my life. Only he can
[2:32:02] minister to me. Only he can do
[2:32:06] what he can do."
[2:32:08] Let me get down here as we bring this
[2:32:10] down. skipping through a whole lot of
[2:32:16] things, but I want you to hear these
[2:32:18] words pinned in a song. Mountains are
[2:32:23] still being moved.
[2:32:25] Strongholds are still being loosed.
[2:32:29] God, we believe it. We see it. Wonders
[2:32:31] are still what you do. We're here for
[2:32:34] you. Come and do what you do.
[2:32:38] Will there be a cry like that? Come,
[2:32:39] Lord, and do what you do.
[2:32:41] come and set our hearts are on you cuz
[2:32:44] we need a move. The bodies are still
[2:32:46] being raised. Giants are still being
[2:32:48] slayed. We believe it. Yes, we can see
[2:32:50] that wonders are still what you do. We
[2:32:53] are here for you. Come and do what you
[2:32:55] do cuz miracles happen when you move.
[2:33:00] Healing is coming into this room.
[2:33:02] Miracles happen when you move. Heaven is
[2:33:05] coming into this room. He miracles
[2:33:07] happen in this room when you move.
[2:33:09] Healing and deliverance is coming into
[2:33:12] this room. This is a move. We are here
[2:33:16] for you, God. Come and do what you do.
[2:33:30] Ron, but I tell it again because it's a
[2:33:31] personal testimony. May have told it
[2:33:33] here last time. I don't know. But it's a
[2:33:36] it's a testimony that God gave me. My
[2:33:39] little boy born 2003, Andrew, with some
[2:33:43] bad lungs. I watched in a moment of a
[2:33:46] happy celebration turned to complete
[2:33:50] panic of doctors and nurses as this
[2:33:52] little boy begin to turn blue and they
[2:33:55] begin to turn colors. They begin to rush
[2:33:58] him down the hallway. And I watched as
[2:34:00] they disappeared down the hallway. Right
[2:34:03] then, that spirit came down and begin to
[2:34:06] say, "What did you do this time? You
[2:34:09] must have did something wrong to go what
[2:34:11] for this to happen. He just he's going
[2:34:13] to punish you cuz you did something."
[2:34:16] And I was like, "God, I don't know if I
[2:34:18] did. I know there's grace for
[2:34:19] forgiveness."
[2:34:21] And I I'm searching through my life and
[2:34:24] wondering what what you know. And I
[2:34:25] watch as they take him out of the
[2:34:27] hospital and they put him in a
[2:34:28] helicopter and they fly him to another
[2:34:30] hospital because they don't have the
[2:34:31] capabilities there. And I'm watching
[2:34:33] this all happen and it just it's just
[2:34:35] like just almost slow motion but very
[2:34:38] fast if I can explain it. It's like
[2:34:40] looking at it you're like God it's all
[2:34:42] out of cater and chaos around you. Your
[2:34:44] wife is just had a C-section and she's
[2:34:47] now in one hospital and the baby's in
[2:34:48] another about an hour away. And it was
[2:34:50] like God what's happened? What what's
[2:34:53] happened? I would get up in the next day
[2:34:55] or so and I'd go to Walmart and I'd turn
[2:34:57] on the radio and I I would I would begin
[2:35:00] to listen to this preacher read the
[2:35:01] scripture. It just started right there.
[2:35:03] There's a little Christian station and
[2:35:04] they had a preacher that was going to
[2:35:05] preach on it that morning, I guess.
[2:35:06] Turned it on and he was reading the
[2:35:08] Bible and he said, "Abraham believed in
[2:35:11] God. That's all it say." And I shut it
[2:35:13] off. I said, "That's exactly right."
[2:35:15] Amen. Amen. And I'm a son of Abraham.
[2:35:24] And if Abraham believed in you, I'm
[2:35:26] going to believe in
[2:35:28] you. And I began to think about it about
[2:35:31] how in the Old Testament that Abraham
[2:35:33] did wrong. And he made a lot of
[2:35:34] mistakes. He did things when God told
[2:35:36] him not to. He did exactly what God told
[2:35:38] him not to do. He lied. He done all
[2:35:41] kinds of stuff. And it shows that under
[2:35:44] the blood of bulls and goats.
[2:35:46] But there came a transfer.
[2:35:51] There came a new covenant.
[2:35:53] And he was no longer in the New
[2:35:55] Testament under the blood of bulls and
[2:35:56] goats. He was now under the blood of a
[2:36:00] righteous lamb of God.
[2:36:02] And I began to look in the scripture and
[2:36:04] I could not find one fault of Abraham
[2:36:07] written in the New Testament.
[2:36:10] Matter of fact, Paul says he staggered
[2:36:13] not at the promises of God, but was
[2:36:15] strong in the
[2:36:19] faith. I said, "Praise God. I'm under
[2:36:23] the same blood.
[2:36:26] I'm under the same blood." And I would
[2:36:29] go and I would watch. I tell Sister
[2:36:31] Ruth, I said, "Sister Ruth, we're not
[2:36:32] going to look at monitors. We're not
[2:36:34] going to look at none of that. We're
[2:36:35] going to look at the promise of God.
[2:36:37] We're sons and daughters of Abraham.
[2:36:39] We're going to believe him for this
[2:36:40] miracle.
[2:36:42] Something just welled up on the inside
[2:36:44] of us. And we would walk into that
[2:36:46] hospital room he would be there in a
[2:36:48] paralyzed state. Little baby about that
[2:36:50] long just looked like he was dead as a
[2:36:52] doornail. And this machine breathing for
[2:36:54] him and went from a ventilator to an
[2:36:56] oscillator and it got worse and worse
[2:36:57] and
[2:36:58] worse. We didn't look at the monitors.
[2:37:01] We didn't look at what the doctor said.
[2:37:03] We looked at what this right here said.
[2:37:07] It was our turn for a miracle.
[2:37:11] That's right. And we would hold on and
[2:37:14] about two weeks, God would come on the
[2:37:16] scene and would give him back his lungs
[2:37:19] and we would take him home jubilant and
[2:37:21] happy and about a week later he would
[2:37:23] get sick with some kind of virus and go
[2:37:25] right back in the hospital in there for
[2:37:27] another two weeks.
[2:37:30] get out. And the doctors would say to my
[2:37:34] wife and she would take him to his
[2:37:36] checkup. Said, "You're just gonna have
[2:37:37] to get used to it. This baby's got bad
[2:37:38] lungs. He's gonna be on a breathing
[2:37:40] treatment for we don't know how long,
[2:37:42] but at least through his up into his
[2:37:44] teenage years, maybe have to have a
[2:37:46] breathing treatment every day. He's got
[2:37:48] bad lungs." She would just kind of in
[2:37:51] the world take the machine and take the
[2:37:53] medicine, take it home. And she would
[2:37:56] give him his first breathing treatment.
[2:37:58] And as she was giving him, she began to
[2:38:00] re remember what God done for him in the
[2:38:03] hospital. Said, "He's the same God
[2:38:08] today." She said, "This boy don't have
[2:38:11] to be on no breathing
[2:38:13] treatment." I don't believe God's done
[2:38:15] what he's done for him already for him
[2:38:17] to have to live on a breathing treatment
[2:38:19] the rest of his life. I believe he's the
[2:38:21] same yesterday, today, and forever. She
[2:38:23] folded that hose up. She put that
[2:38:25] medicine back in a box.
[2:38:28] The next day
[2:38:29] he's struggling. She's saying, "Thank
[2:38:32] God for healing him. Thank God for
[2:38:34] healing." Next day, good lungs. Next
[2:38:36] day, good lungs. Next day, good
[2:38:45] lungs. I always said as he was getting
[2:38:48] older, I said, "God done such a miracle.
[2:38:50] He's the loudest kid I got."
[2:38:52] You'd always tell him, "Andrew, use your
[2:38:54] inside voice." But you know what? We got
[2:38:56] to realize what God did for him. Go
[2:38:58] ahead, Andrew.
[2:39:00] Scream if you want to. Shout if you want
[2:39:03] to. We don't care, Andrew. God done a
[2:39:06] miracle in your
[2:39:07] [Applause]
[2:39:11] life. I trust that God can come down in
[2:39:14] this building this week, this weekend,
[2:39:16] and even tonight, and give you a new
[2:39:18] heart or give you a new lung or give you
[2:39:21] something that'll praise him.
[2:39:25] Come on. Is there somebody ready to walk
[2:39:28] the prison?
[2:39:31] I've been in the prison long enough.
[2:39:33] I've been bound long enough. I've had
[2:39:35] Satan telling me what's going to be and
[2:39:38] how it's going to be. But tonight is my
[2:39:40] turn.
[2:39:42] Tonight is my moment. Tonight is my
[2:39:45] hour. Tonight is my miracle. It's a days
[2:39:49] of miracles and it's my turn. I'm going
[2:39:51] to touch the hem of his garment.
[2:39:55] [Applause]
[2:40:00] If you feel that way tonight, how many
[2:40:03] How many says, "Lord, I need a miracle."
[2:40:10] And I'm going to make a challenge to
[2:40:11] you. Won't you walk out of your seat and
[2:40:13] come down here and get it?
[2:40:17] If you believe he's in the building,
[2:40:18] walk down here and get it.
[2:40:21] He's here for you tonight.
[2:40:25] He's here for you tonight.
[2:40:28] Hallelujah. Come on, Sister Rebecca.
[2:40:30] Come help me. Sister Rebecca, can you
[2:40:32] help me? Help me right quick. Amen.
[2:40:34] Let's just praise him for a moment. Oh,
[2:40:37] let's just worship him. Amen. You need
[2:40:39] chains to fall off. You need things to
[2:40:41] happen. Amen. God, I'm here for a
[2:40:43] miracle and it's my turn. I'm going to
[2:40:45] touch the hem of your garment.
[2:40:49] I'm going to break through these things
[2:40:50] that's been trying to hold me. This
[2:40:52] spirit of darkness has been trying to
[2:40:54] overshadow my life. I'm going to break
[2:40:56] out of it.
[2:40:58] Get into the light of God's word and be
[2:41:01] raised up into a heavenly atmosphere
[2:41:03] that all things are possible. Amen. I
[2:41:06] believe we're in that kind of atmosphere
[2:41:07] tonight. I believe we're in the
[2:41:08] atmosphere that anything can happen.
[2:41:12] I believe we're in an atmosphere that a
[2:41:14] mama can ask for her daughter and ask
[2:41:16] for her son and it'll happen. I believe
[2:41:18] we're in an atmosphere, amen, of faith
[2:41:20] right now that you can ask and God can
[2:41:23] put your marriage back
[2:41:25] together. I believe we're in an
[2:41:27] atmosphere, amen, that you can ask and
[2:41:29] you can receive the Holy Ghost. I
[2:41:31] believe we're in an atmosphere that you
[2:41:33] can repent and God can come down and
[2:41:36] change your heart forever. I believe
[2:41:38] we're in the atmosphere of healing. I
[2:41:40] believe we're in an atmosphere of all
[2:41:42] things are possible.

[2:42:22] God. And the same one that did it for
[2:42:24] Andrew is the same one that'll do it for
[2:42:27] her.
[2:42:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Listen, you'll
[2:42:33] go from saying it's going to be well to
[2:42:35] it is well.

[2:47:15] he said he talked about that song and
[2:47:17] that tape he was in one of the sub
[2:47:20] meanest man in Santa Maria and he said
[2:47:23] what God wants is for you to worship him
[2:47:26] when he comes down he wants somebody
[2:47:28] that'll wash his feet. He wants somebody
[2:47:32] that'll get enough about them. They'll

[2:48:40] way is ever
[2:48:44] more. He is higher than the highest.
[2:48:51] He's greater than the
[2:48:54] great. No one will ever take his
[2:48:59] crown
[2:49:02] away. He's more mighty than the
[2:49:07] mightiest. He reigns from above.
[2:49:14] He's the
[2:49:17] alltime
[2:49:19] undisputed
[2:49:21] undefeated
[2:49:23] champion of love.
[2:49:26] [Music]
[2:49:29] He left his
[2:49:31] hometown to enter this
[2:49:35] arena to raise his hands in
[2:49:40] victory for you and
[2:49:44] me. But an angry crowd cried,
[2:49:49] "Crucify he who wore that crown."
[2:49:55] And they watch my champion
[2:49:59] go
[2:50:00] down. Oh, but I will never count him out
[2:50:07] cuz I'm a witness
[2:50:10] of that day he rose to claim that
[2:50:15] title
[2:50:18] champion of
[2:50:23] love. He's higher than the
[2:50:27] highest. He's greater than the
[2:50:31] great. No one will ever take his crown
[2:50:39] away. He's more mighty than the
[2:50:44] mightiest. He reigns from above.
[2:50:51] He's the
