[1:26] short i had of course go back and buy
[1:28] something i was in the store and

[1:31] and i went back to well i was down in
[1:34] tractor supply and in clarksville and
[1:37] and i said well that's where i got it
[1:40] and uh you know first i was looking for
[1:42] iowa i said i gotta i called caleb i
[1:44] said what was it that i bought was it
[1:46] ryobi or what was it
[1:47] he says no it's porter cable okay thank
[1:49] you thank you thank you and it's porter
[1:52] cable so i went over there and sure
[1:53] enough they had the same
[1:54] uh porter cable they were selling the
[1:56] same thing and i went and talked to the
[1:58] manager basically the main guy there and
[2:00] i said at first i looked around
[2:01] everywhere and i couldn't find it i'm
[2:02] talking
[2:03] he looked on his computer no we don't
[2:05] have that at the time so all right so i
[2:07] went to home depot down talking tonight
[2:10] and and i got to looking around there
[2:13] and and for uh what was it again railby
[2:16] or porter cable you couldn't remember
[2:17] what it was i i couldn't believe how
[2:20] many times i forgot that folder came
[2:21] what's the hardest thing to remember the
[2:23] world as is
[2:25] i was i was discussing with myself how
[2:27] many times i forgot
[2:28] and what that was i remember seeing the
[2:31] chop saw and they had the bigger stuff
[2:32] as a in a porter cable but and i went
[2:35] back to that aisle three times to
[2:37] remember the name of that porter cable
[2:39] because i couldn't remember either kept
[2:41] going right over i said you really are
[2:43] there's something wrong with you
[2:45] but anyway you know
[2:47] but uh anyway so we
[2:49] didn't get anywhere they didn't have it
[2:51] lowe's didn't have it nobody had it but
[2:53] it's probably what they have is aquatic
[2:54] sales gimmick anymore but anyway just to
[2:57] think about that you know and i said boy
[2:59] i last another 10 years
[3:02] and you know
[3:04] what am i going to be like what's it
[3:06] going to be like
[3:07] i won't remember how to get home but no
[3:09] let's not do that amen we won't confess
[3:11] that but look
[3:13] i thought about you know that
[3:14] for a believer how many knows a believer
[3:17] like abraham it says that abraham
[3:20] look for a city whose builder and maker
[3:23] is god
[3:24] how many know that
[3:25] we long for something that
[3:28] that is eternal amen something that
[3:31] lasts forever that doesn't change
[3:34] that's the goal that's the ambition of
[3:36] the believer is to have something that
[3:38] does continue
[3:40] how many knows that like we spoke here
[3:42] about a week ago or so talking about we
[3:43] do have received a kingdom that cannot
[3:46] be shaken
[3:47] right
[3:48] but we have a kingdom within us how many
[3:50] knows the kingdom of god is within us
[3:52] and that kingdom cannot be moved it
[3:53] cannot be shaken so we have a hold of
[3:56] something that's eternal
[3:58] aren't you glad to have a hold of jesus
[3:59] christ
[4:01] that even though the outside fades even
[4:03] though the outside fades away and and so
[4:05] forth that one that on the inside you
[4:07] have confidence that it doesn't matter
[4:10] how wrinkled this get it don't matter if
[4:12] you draw your last breath you have
[4:14] something that's eternal not we'll have
[4:16] but have something now that's eternal
[4:18] and it's the same faith that abraham had
[4:21] when god spoke to him he left his city
[4:24] he left his country he left his kin
[4:26] folks because he was in pursuit so to
[4:28] speak of that eternal city whose builder
[4:31] and maker is god amen
[4:35] isn't it nice to see people that
[4:37] are
[4:38] solid and that don't
[4:40] change many knows a real christian
[4:44] they don't change
[4:47] you know now i know they change for the
[4:49] better right
[4:50] but they're not
[4:51] they're not up and down and in and out
[4:53] amen
[4:54] sometimes we in our flesh sometimes we
[4:57] do that but overall in the long run you
[5:00] realize that person is just solid
[5:03] i could name names and i'm not gonna but
[5:05] you know when you see somebody that's
[5:07] just for the last 30 years i've been
[5:08] here about 30 years and for 30 years
[5:10] just
[5:11] like a rock just oh yeah i did storms
[5:14] come storm go but that person their
[5:16] anchor is
[5:18] in christ and they don't move that that
[5:20] doesn't change
[5:22] it shows that they have something that
[5:24] does continue amen
[5:27] praise be to god
[5:29] amen so i was thinking that i was just
[5:30] thinking
[5:31] you know we're thankful for uh something
[5:34] that does continue
[5:36] amen and
[5:38] whether it's our strength brother
[5:40] branham looked at his dad
[5:42] and i i don't know i've never been
[5:44] sunburned so badly until the shirt stuck
[5:47] on the back of my
[5:49] my my skin have you
[5:51] but i think brother uh ram talked about
[5:54] his dad heist
[5:55] his dad had you know he was so
[5:58] uh he had worked so hard and so forth
[6:00] and i guess son or whatever that his
[6:01] shirt was stuck to his his back you know
[6:04] he was
[6:04] muscles and he could lift a 900 pound
[6:07] log and so forth and
[6:09] just strong men thought he might have
[6:10] been live forever
[6:12] at 52 he was gone
[6:15] amen
[6:17] i think brother bannon was about 56 when
[6:19] he left i think brother tommy sent me
[6:21] that the other day he made 56 years old
[6:23] and he was gone you know and i'm
[6:25] thinking i'm
[6:26] turning 60 that's 22nd that's gonna be
[6:28] in two weeks
[6:29] and then
[6:31] i told my wife i says in two weeks it's
[6:33] my 60th
[6:34] birthday on the way to church and and
[6:37] she kind of
[6:38] i don't know she acted different than
[6:40] what she normally does when i tell her
[6:42] my birthday
[6:43] she
[6:45] like
[6:46] really he was like wow really for real
[6:50] and with you know what i'm doing and
[6:52] building the audition and all the work
[6:55] that i do now he says well you're just
[6:56] young yet you know and i was like thank
[6:58] you honey i love you too you know
[7:01] but anyways as i hope i have many good
[7:04] years left but anyway i'll tell you what
[7:06] when you have a big old 6-0 staring in
[7:09] your face you know you're not just too
[7:10] young anymore amen
[7:12] but we do thank god for his eternal amen
[7:15] like that song says there my home shall
[7:16] be eternal
[7:18] amen how many likes that just be
[7:20] anchored in christ
[7:22] going through his life not having to
[7:23] worry and
[7:25] knowing that this fades away but guess
[7:27] what he doesn't never fade away and we
[7:29] know the one that is the same yesterday
[7:33] today
[7:34] and forever
[7:35] amen
[7:37] and we look forward to that because
[7:39] eternity what eternal life what eternity
[7:42] is

[7:45] of time what did he say he says there
[7:46] was no
[7:47] yesterdays right
[7:49] and there's no tomorrows

[25:07] preach it just leveled out and i said
[25:09] well thank you lord there was no
[25:11] interruptions and
[25:12] i thought well lord you just help that
[25:15] to work because you know there's a lot
[25:16] of benefit
[25:18] some people can't come to the house of
[25:19] god and it's good that they can and
[25:22] i guess all of us abandoned brother

[38:56] foreign
[39:01] good morning everyone um
[39:10] um so uh
[39:14] i think that will be all for the music
[39:16] [Applause]
[39:26] so um i believe uh me standing here
[39:29] today um
[39:31] is prophecy being fulfilled because
[39:34] my mom told me that when i was being
[39:36] dedicated that she heard god tell her
[39:39] that i was gonna be a preacher
[39:41] now
[39:43] i didn't understand it
[39:45] then because i i was
[39:47] i was young and i didn't want to be a
[39:49] preacher either
[39:52] neither was i ready
[39:54] and um
[39:57] but god always has it planned out so
[40:00] one day
[40:01] uh i heard a voice tell me
[40:04] something is going to happen today that
[40:05] is going to change your life
[40:08] and
[40:09] i didn't know if that was god or not i
[40:11] thought that was strange because nothing
[40:13] like that ever really happens to me
[40:17] every day so like
[40:18] um
[40:21] and
[40:22] like later that day i was
[40:25] i was watching a video of a
[40:28] witness of the miracles of william
[40:30] branham and i was getting quite
[40:32] emotional and i had i'd started praying
[40:35] and
[40:36] what my mom said and about when i was
[40:39] being dedicated came into mind and
[40:42] and i
[40:44] i started thinking like should i
[40:46] ask god for a sign if i meant to be a
[40:48] preacher or not
[40:50] and then ju just then um
[40:53] i heard the the voice of god tell me in
[40:55] my head that um
[40:58] someone will tell you that you meant to
[40:59] be a preacher and i thought that's
[41:01] strange because it's like um
[41:04] the only um
[41:07] place i was going after that was like my
[41:09] parents place and how is that gonna
[41:11] happen i was like
[41:13] and
[41:15] and so when i went over there
[41:18] um
[41:19] i started talking to god and to my
[41:21] sister because like that was
[41:24] um
[41:26] well that was what uh
[41:28] i was doing i i had a reason to do that
[41:31] because
[41:32] of something i forget what we were
[41:33] talking about but
[41:35] um
[41:36] but then behind me my sister annabelle
[41:39] tells me
[41:40] that danny's probably meant to be a
[41:42] preacher and i thought
[41:44] that right there i i was just i was just
[41:46] praying for that sign so
[41:51] all right um
[41:53] so
[41:54] i'll just get um started uh
[41:58] i'll start
[42:00] let's pray
[42:02] father god i pray that that you helped
[42:05] me this day to bring
[42:07] a message to your people lord
[42:10] help me to to um
[42:13] show them
[42:14] and um how to get closer to you lord god
[42:18] because we all want to get close to you
[42:20] lord and i i believe that at this day we
[42:24] all will get closer to you lord
[42:26] because i believe that that is your will
[42:28] lord and i i pray that you help me to
[42:31] get closer to you and get the people to
[42:33] get closer to you lord because that's
[42:35] our desire lord god and and lord i pray
[42:37] that you'll help me to preach
[42:39] what you wouldn't preach lord lord just
[42:43] help me and help the the people to
[42:46] hear you lord god lord i pray that
[42:48] you'll speak through me lord that that
[42:50] the people might hear you lord god i
[42:52] pray this in your precious thing lord
[42:54] jesus christ amen
[42:58] all right let's uh turn
[43:00] and your bible if you will to
[43:03] um
[43:06] psalm
[43:07] 1
[43:08] and we'll
[43:10] read verse 1 to 3.
[43:30] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[43:32] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[43:35] in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[43:38] sea of the scornful but his delight is
[43:41] in the law of the lord and in his law
[43:44] doeth he meditate day and night and he
[43:47] shall be like a tree planted by the
[43:49] rivers of
[43:51] water and
[43:52] that bringeth forth his fruit and his
[43:55] season his leaf
[43:57] also shall not wither and whatsoever he
[44:00] doeth shall prosper
[44:04] and uh also another verse proverbs 4
[44:08] 25-27
[44:36] let thine eyes look right on and let
[44:38] thine eyelids look straight before thee
[44:41] ponder the path of thy feet and let all
[44:44] thy waste be established turn not to the
[44:47] right hand nor to the left remove thy
[44:50] foot from evil
[44:54] may goddess blessings to the word you
[44:56] can be seated
[45:06] now i read this uh a while ago um
[45:10] and
[45:11] it caught my attention when i read this
[45:13] when distractions overtake time with god
[45:16] it leaves the door wide open for the
[45:18] enemy to drop temptation in
[45:24] and i wrote down on my notes uh
[45:27] like that vision that brother branham
[45:29] had as the bride
[45:31] marching
[45:32] that he had of the bride marching onward
[45:34] toward the sky and as they were marching
[45:37] some of them
[45:38] began looking around they started to get
[45:41] distracted
[45:43] or or something like that now um
[45:48] like like he said um
[45:51] uh
[45:54] well
[45:55] i i put this down but um don't look left
[45:58] don't look right keep marching forward
[46:00] that's that that's what the devil does
[46:02] sometimes he he'll create a diversion to
[46:06] get your attention and get you off guard
[46:08] and then slip temptation in and it will
[46:12] be easier to get you to fall because you
[46:15] are off guard see and you'll begin to
[46:18] start backsiding if you're not careful
[46:25] and sometimes satan will send a
[46:27] diversion to get us off the path we are
[46:30] meant to be on and it'll be so subtle
[46:32] sometimes and seems so innocent we'll be
[46:35] blind to it
[46:37] and it it may seem
[46:39] like such a a small thing that
[46:44] seems like it don't matter but if it
[46:46] consumes all your attention or brings
[46:50] or it may just have a part of your
[46:51] attention but if it brings you to a
[46:54] place where you're no longer fully
[46:55] focused on god you better watch out
[47:01] now now see distractions are everywhere
[47:04] because we get so caught up with the
[47:07] destruction of this world even a cell
[47:09] phone we um
[47:11] get uh focused on on
[47:14] on other things like sometimes we'll
[47:17] we'll put on a
[47:19] tv or something and uh we'll begin to
[47:22] start start looking at other things and
[47:26] and and we'll get sidetracked and
[47:28] something will come up and we'll and
[47:29] we'll forget to we'll begin to forget to
[47:32] read the word of god and we'll forget to
[47:35] to focus on god like we should and we're
[47:38] all guilty of that sometimes
[47:41] if even me because because i know how
[47:43] hard it was and as this week to to just
[47:47] fully focus on god and i i begin to to
[47:50] realize that that we we get so caught up
[47:54] with focusing on other things that that
[47:57] we don't
[47:58] i mean what we should really focus on
[48:01] every single day
[48:03] and that should be our main focus every
[48:05] day i mean sure we got our jobs we got
[48:08] things we do every single day and
[48:11] and and
[48:12] but sometimes we let that get a hold of
[48:14] us and we we begin to
[48:17] to start looking at other things you
[48:18] know if if we can
[48:22] if we can only
[48:24] see where it takes us sometimes and
[48:27] and get it back focused on god again
[48:37] now um
[48:39] distractions are all around us we've got
[48:42] to be what about it we've got to have
[48:44] self-discipline otherwise it will
[48:46] control us and consume our time which
[48:49] our time is our most
[48:51] valuable asset our time is limited
[48:53] distractions and pleasure is unlimited
[48:56] but not eternal if we focus all our time
[48:59] on god how we may serve him we'll get
[49:02] closer to god and get to that place
[49:04] where we're in his perfect will
[49:09] and and sometimes you know
[49:12] we
[49:13] we we just
[49:15] you know sometimes we don't feel like
[49:18] you know reading
[49:19] the bible or listening to william
[49:22] brandon tapes and stuff and we get
[49:25] we we get um
[49:28] side tracted you know and
[49:32] and
[49:33] if
[49:33] if we if we keep doing that then
[49:37] we'll we'll just get it further off and
[49:40] get in a worse place than we were before
[49:50] now i i
[49:52] found this out the other day
[49:54] the the number one cause for accidents
[49:57] in the world is distracted driving
[50:00] not being focused on the road we we need
[50:03] to stay focused on god so we don't get
[50:06] into accidents along the way
[50:10] that's the leading cause for backsiding
[50:12] distractions overtaking people's time to
[50:15] where they stop going to church
[50:17] stop seeking god and start
[50:20] and start focusing on the things of the
[50:22] world
[50:28] it could be something to happen i don't
[50:30] know
[50:32] but it could simply be something that
[50:33] came up
[50:35] it isn't always something that is sinful
[50:37] that comes up just something that
[50:39] diverts your attention
[50:41] don't ever let the devil divert your
[50:43] attention off of god he deserves all of
[50:45] our attention
[50:55] we need to develop a mindset that any
[50:58] time that we should spend with god but
[51:00] don't is an opportunity to spend with
[51:02] god wasted
[51:05] not an opportunity to do something else
[51:07] that seems more enjoyable
[51:11] sometimes
[51:13] we will always choose to spend time
[51:16] doing something else that we like to do
[51:18] because it's fun
[51:20] and picking up that bible and listening
[51:21] to brother brandon preach
[51:23] just
[51:25] just seems so boring sometimes
[51:40] excuse me i was i was sick yesterday so
[51:43] i still got a little bit of um
[51:47] mucus in my system so
[51:56] this generation has the most
[51:58] dopamine highs
[52:00] you can get
[52:02] you can get everybody it um
[52:06] wants to do
[52:07] what what makes them happy it seems
[52:10] seems that no one wants to even pick up
[52:12] a book because they got their phone we
[52:15] we
[52:17] need to put a stop to staying so focused
[52:20] on doing what makes our flesh feel good
[52:23] and start disciplining ourselves to do
[52:25] what our flesh doesn't want to do
[52:30] amen we get so distracted focusing on
[52:33] ourselves that we forget to focus on god
[52:36] we need to get back focused on god
[52:40] i mean
[52:42] i mean this you know sometimes
[52:45] sometimes the
[52:47] the devil always does that like
[52:49] like we
[52:50] um
[52:51] we get so focused on other things and
[52:54] and get so caught up with with these
[52:57] other things and you know
[53:01] it
[53:03] that's what what happens
[53:05] we we get off track and we start
[53:07] focusing on on the things that we
[53:09] shouldn't focus on
[53:15] and um
[53:18] and one one thing is
[53:21] we we just
[53:22] just need to get back focused again you
[53:24] know and
[53:28] and uh
[53:38] i mean
[53:40] there's a lot of us that that uh
[53:43] have a television in our house
[53:46] i mean
[53:48] it it does depend on what you watch on
[53:50] it but but if you're if you're sitting
[53:52] there watching it all day long and is is
[53:55] having all your attention and everything
[53:58] when we start to to do that when we
[54:00] start allowing these things to to get
[54:03] our attention
[54:04] to to focus on those those things
[54:08] like like uh for me i i was
[54:11] focused on on watching tiktok because it
[54:14] becomes an addiction these things like
[54:16] that like this
[54:17] our phones our devices are our tv it
[54:21] becomes addictions that we get so
[54:23] focused on it
[54:25] we get we get so focused on these things
[54:27] because it becomes addiction and we
[54:29] enjoy doing these things
[54:31] but but
[54:33] that then we allow it to to um
[54:37] take the place of
[54:39] the the bible we even say we got we got
[54:41] the bible app on our our phones let's
[54:44] just
[54:45] read the bible on our phones but but
[54:48] then another notification will will come
[54:51] up and we'll go on on instagram or tick
[54:54] tock or something like that because
[54:56] because uh someone messaged me it better
[54:58] takes back someone someone
[55:02] someone
[55:04] ends calling me right now
[55:06] i was reading in the bible but i gotta
[55:08] take this call
[55:10] i don't know who it could be it could be
[55:11] important sometimes we can't put our
[55:13] phones down because
[55:15] because we we we get so um
[55:19] focus on our phone that that we begin to
[55:22] allow it to overtake our time and
[55:25] overtake what what we should be doing we
[55:29] should be focusing on god every single
[55:31] day more than anything else more than
[55:34] going on our phones and our devices and
[55:36] more than than doing any of these other
[55:38] things because these other things like
[55:41] phones and and
[55:43] i don't know your tablet your um tv it's
[55:47] not as important
[55:48] and
[55:49] but it feels a whole lot better to do
[55:52] those things because we enjoy doing it
[55:55] but if only we could just
[55:58] enjoy reading the word of god and and
[56:01] focus on god enjoy getting into prayer
[56:04] and really just as
[56:07] praying to god and and focusing all of
[56:10] our attention on god that that's the
[56:12] most important thing
[56:15] i pray that that each and every one of
[56:17] us can get a closer walk with god and
[56:19] focus on god more instead of focusing on
[56:22] these other things that don't matter
[56:25] that we always get our attention on
[56:27] because we like to do those things we
[56:30] like to
[56:31] sure it's it's all right
[56:33] to do it you know because a little bit
[56:36] but when it overtakes all of our time to
[56:40] where we can't focus on god then it
[56:43] sometimes it just has to go right
[56:45] instead of
[56:47] uh
[56:48] getting rid of the time to focus on god
[56:51] that that our attention
[56:53] and gets
[56:55] on these devices and so forth that that
[56:58] we
[56:59] that it overtakes
[57:01] time with god instead of
[57:03] letting this get dusty why don't we let
[57:06] this get dusty instead
[57:08] and focus on god again instead of doing
[57:11] these other things you know
[57:14] i mean
[57:15] it's it's great and all that
[57:17] all the devices we got
[57:20] i mean
[57:21] but
[57:22] when when you think about it satan uses
[57:25] these devices more than god does
[57:29] and and and
[57:31] if satan can get our attention
[57:34] and if he can get our attention even if
[57:36] he doesn't cause us to sin but if he
[57:38] causes us to to um
[57:41] to focus on these things instead of
[57:43] focusing on god then he's got us
[57:48] and we need we need to to get back to
[57:50] focusing on god we need to to get back
[57:52] to doing these things rather than
[57:55] focusing on our phones and devices and
[57:57] so forth
[57:58] because
[58:01] i mean
[58:04] you know
[58:05] um
[58:07] who who uh which one of us doesn't have
[58:09] a phone in our house
[58:12] which one of us
[58:13] i mean there's a lot of us that don't
[58:14] have tvs and stuff because willie and
[58:16] brandon preach against that
[58:18] but
[58:21] it's it's what you watch on this is a
[58:23] tiny little
[58:24] tv screen
[58:29] and and what what you go on on it that's
[58:32] that's what counts because see uh you
[58:36] can watch really innocent movies and
[58:38] stuff but but uh
[58:41] what you watch on on this phone what you
[58:43] go on that that counts
[58:46] it's tuned for sure i mean
[58:48] um you could have a tv screen in your
[58:50] house and and all you do on it is is um
[58:54] i don't know
[58:55] you listen to william branham that then
[58:58] that that's all right
[58:59] i say that that's fine because you could
[59:02] do that the same thing on these little
[59:04] devices you got here on the screens and
[59:06] stuff you can and
[59:08] use it for for the glory of god or you
[59:10] can lose use it for for satan and and uh
[59:14] this distracting
[59:16] distracting you from focusing on god
[59:18] and we do that
[59:20] every single day
[59:23] we focus too much on these devices
[59:25] because we like going on these devices
[59:29] and ed
[59:31] and sometimes they can be simply devil
[59:33] the devil's devices
[59:36] we need we need to get back to focusing
[59:38] on god instead of these other things
[59:43] i
[59:44] mean
[59:46] you know
[59:47] sometimes
[59:49] it's just like
[59:50] um
[59:53] we have uh important things to deal with
[59:56] and all that that's all right
[59:59] but when it over
[1:00:00] takes your time
[1:00:01] and and distracts you
[1:00:04] that that's where you're going and wrong
[1:00:12] another another word i was
[1:00:14] thinking of the word diversion an
[1:00:18] instance of turning something aside from
[1:00:20] its course something intended to
[1:00:22] distract someone's attention from
[1:00:24] something more important
[1:00:27] and and that's what these things can be
[1:00:28] diversions
[1:00:31] that that satan
[1:00:33] and and technology is one of satan's
[1:00:35] biggest weapons against us
[1:00:48] sometimes satan will send a diversion to
[1:00:50] guess off the path we are meant to be on
[1:00:53] but it will be so
[1:00:55] i think i read this one but um
[1:00:58] yeah it'll be so subtle and so innocent
[1:01:01] that we'll be blind into it
[1:01:10] what happens when water isn't heated or
[1:01:12] cold
[1:01:13] it becomes lukewarm
[1:01:16] that's what happens when we don't focus
[1:01:17] on god when destruction is overtake time
[1:01:19] with god we start becoming lukewarm
[1:01:23] we become like lukewarm water just
[1:01:26] sitting there
[1:01:27] we need a good heating to get back focus
[1:01:29] on god regardless of what we feel like
[1:01:32] doing
[1:01:36] peter had what water what peter when he
[1:01:39] had walked out
[1:01:40] on the water looking at jesus he was
[1:01:43] focused on jesus and he he asked jesus
[1:01:47] if he could um walk
[1:01:50] out
[1:01:51] on the water towards him and and and
[1:01:54] jesus said come
[1:01:55] and
[1:01:57] and uh
[1:01:58] he he he walked out looking at jesus he
[1:02:01] all of a sudden and became uh
[1:02:04] focused on the wind he started looking
[1:02:05] at the wind he got distracted by the
[1:02:07] wind in the storm
[1:02:09] he his focus drifted from jesus to the
[1:02:11] storm and he became fearful and started
[1:02:14] sinking in the water
[1:02:16] we
[1:02:17] we we get
[1:02:19] that waste sometimes we start
[1:02:22] we start out focus on god then then
[1:02:25] storms and trials come up we begin to
[1:02:28] get fearful and start looking at the
[1:02:29] trials rather than keeping our eyes on
[1:02:31] jesus
[1:02:37] now uh i got i got this this uh story um
[1:02:41] that i wrote down in an ancient
[1:02:45] indian stage was i mean indian sage was
[1:02:49] teaching his
[1:02:50] students the art of archery
[1:02:53] one one day the stage wanted to test the
[1:02:56] skill of the students in archery so he
[1:02:59] called out
[1:03:01] he he called out
[1:03:02] all of them he put a wooden bird
[1:03:06] as the target and asked him to aim at
[1:03:08] the eye of the bird the first student
[1:03:10] came who he was asked to describe what
[1:03:14] he saw he said
[1:03:16] i see the trees the branches the leaves
[1:03:19] the sky
[1:03:21] and the bird in its eye the sage asked
[1:03:24] the student to wait then ask the second
[1:03:27] student the same student
[1:03:29] he asked this
[1:03:30] the other student
[1:03:32] the same question the second student
[1:03:34] replied
[1:03:35] i only see the eye of the bird the the
[1:03:38] sage asked him to release the bow the
[1:03:40] arrow went straight and hit the eye of
[1:03:43] the bird
[1:03:44] if we if we start begin to start looking
[1:03:47] at other things and and uh
[1:03:50] and and
[1:03:51] you know get start getting distracted
[1:03:53] and looking at other things and and then
[1:03:56] say we're focusing on god as well in the
[1:03:58] midst of it
[1:03:59] and then
[1:04:01] and when we when we do that
[1:04:04] we um we will miss if we
[1:04:07] we're trying to to shoot the the arrow
[1:04:11] and and we we see the sky the wind
[1:04:14] everything else
[1:04:16] and and and and then and the eye
[1:04:19] of the bird we'll end up missing but if
[1:04:21] we just stay focused right on that bur
[1:04:24] the eye of that bird
[1:04:25] will hit it and no matter what so just
[1:04:28] stay focused on god and not these other
[1:04:31] things and not
[1:04:33] that's what happens with with the
[1:04:35] nominations and stuff they
[1:04:37] they get um
[1:04:39] so focused on the little things and and
[1:04:42] uh different theologies and stuff that a
[1:04:45] man came up up with on his own own and
[1:04:49] without the the spirit of god leading
[1:04:51] him and then they begin and to go by
[1:04:54] man's traditions and theologies and so
[1:04:56] forth that that they missed the mark
[1:05:01] the uh when william branham came they
[1:05:04] and and they they didn't know him just
[1:05:06] like the pharisees didn't know no jesus
[1:05:09] when he walked the earth they were so
[1:05:10] focused on their traditions and so forth
[1:05:13] that they didn't notice
[1:05:15] yes the
[1:05:16] the the god that
[1:05:18] they were serving they turned him down
[1:05:25] sometimes we'll get so we'll get so
[1:05:27] focused on our on our past that it'll
[1:05:31] prevent us from being a brighter future
[1:05:33] because we're always looking distracted
[1:05:35] by our past our past will haunt us and
[1:05:38] and keep trying to
[1:05:40] get at us and we need we need to let go
[1:05:42] of those things and and forgive
[1:05:44] ourselves for those things
[1:05:46] because we've already been forgiven why
[1:05:49] are we holding on to those things
[1:05:53] so we need to just stay focused on god
[1:05:56] and not these other things that that we
[1:05:59] we ourselves put in the way that the
[1:06:02] devil doesn't even have to do anything
[1:06:04] when we're when we distract ourselves
[1:06:12] when i was uh
[1:06:13] younger maybe uh
[1:06:16] 10 years ago or so we had goats and we
[1:06:19] we would let them out and let them eat
[1:06:21] grass everywhere
[1:06:23] but
[1:06:24] they weren't allowed to eat the fruit
[1:06:25] trees
[1:06:26] but they they would always try try to
[1:06:28] eat them we would take turns watching
[1:06:31] them and and i remember
[1:06:33] it was my turn and i had this caught an
[1:06:36] innotab and as
[1:06:38] uh i was watching them one one of them
[1:06:41] would inch closer and closer like
[1:06:44] like she she was just eating the grass
[1:06:47] that then would look at me and
[1:06:50] made sure i was distracted
[1:06:52] that then the goat would start eating as
[1:06:55] fast as she could knowing i was
[1:06:59] i was going to notice and chase her away
[1:07:01] any moment
[1:07:02] that that when i when i chased her away
[1:07:05] she begins in grass again close by like
[1:07:07] nothing happened
[1:07:10] and
[1:07:12] and
[1:07:13] began began sneaking there again
[1:07:15] but but she would wait till i was
[1:07:18] distracted
[1:07:21] she would wait till i was distracted and
[1:07:23] and then
[1:07:24] and then uh
[1:07:26] and and then she'll go and eat them not
[1:07:28] not when i'm looking if i'm looking then
[1:07:30] i'll go chase your way real quick
[1:07:34] and uh
[1:07:37] but um
[1:07:43] that that's what what the devil does
[1:07:44] wait wait till we're distracted then
[1:07:47] he'll pounce a lion waits till his prey
[1:07:49] is focused on something else not alert
[1:07:51] and aware of its surroundings he'll
[1:07:53] he'll wait till till we're looking and
[1:07:56] over here and we'll we're sidetracked
[1:07:59] for from god and we begin to focus on
[1:08:02] ourselves or something and we'll focus
[1:08:04] on on uh different things and then he
[1:08:07] and before we know it then something
[1:08:09] will come up so
[1:08:11] so it doesn't have to be something
[1:08:14] that's that's uh right in front of us
[1:08:17] like oh look the devil is trying to uh
[1:08:21] cause me to send here
[1:08:23] it'll be
[1:08:24] very subtle it's always subtle because
[1:08:27] satan's smart he knows we're getting
[1:08:30] we're getting closer to god and stuff
[1:08:32] and we're we're when we're focused on
[1:08:34] god he'll he'll wait and he'll put
[1:08:37] uh
[1:08:38] distractions that we'll want to focus on
[1:08:41] he'll wait till
[1:08:43] we we distract ourselves and
[1:08:45] then he'll come in and then and then
[1:08:48] while we're we're unaware while we're
[1:08:50] we're focusing on something else that's
[1:08:52] when he'll strike that's when he'll
[1:08:55] he'll get at us and that's when when
[1:08:57] he'll he'll try and
[1:08:59] cause us to sin and cause us to do other
[1:09:01] things
[1:09:02] that's what that's what the devil does
[1:09:05] he causes us to fall in sin and and
[1:09:08] everything else like that and and
[1:09:11] and we'll do it to ourselves when we
[1:09:13] distract ourselves and focus on
[1:09:15] something else when we should be
[1:09:17] focusing on god and we do these other
[1:09:19] things
[1:09:21] and and and then you go and say oh it's
[1:09:24] the devil's fault
[1:09:25] well you
[1:09:27] you put it on yourselves you you um you
[1:09:30] distracted yourself you did made a
[1:09:33] choice to focus on something else rather
[1:09:35] than god would put these other things
[1:09:37] before god and focus on something else
[1:09:40] you're making this to be an idol
[1:09:43] and we do that we do that sometimes we
[1:09:46] we put these other things before god
[1:09:49] instead of focusing on god like we
[1:09:51] should we put stuff like our phones tvs
[1:09:55] and everything else
[1:09:56] they become idols to us and we we begin
[1:10:00] to get focused on these other things
[1:10:02] instead of focusing on god like we
[1:10:04] should instead doing these other things
[1:10:06] we get so caught up
[1:10:08] with uh with our own
[1:10:11] own pleasures and stuff that we put in
[1:10:13] front of our face that we put
[1:10:17] to distract us and
[1:10:19] and make us fall away it's not always
[1:10:21] the devil that does it it sure he he he
[1:10:24] probably made it and he knew that we
[1:10:26] would choose to distract ourselves
[1:10:28] sometimes and then and know that that we
[1:10:32] choose it and and ourselves and then and
[1:10:34] then he'll wait till we we're distracted
[1:10:40] and
[1:10:40] like like a lie and like i was saying
[1:10:44] when when a lion
[1:10:45] is
[1:10:46] is trying to get prey trying to sneak up
[1:10:49] and
[1:10:50] really be quiet um you know and then uh
[1:10:53] that little antelope or whatever eating
[1:10:56] eating grass you know
[1:10:58] in this normal appetite it's not doing
[1:11:00] anything wrong it's just eating grass
[1:11:03] but but that antelope knows that it
[1:11:06] should be aware there's always
[1:11:08] always an enemy ready to strike it
[1:11:11] right ready to
[1:11:12] to um
[1:11:14] palace on it instead of being aware all
[1:11:17] the time
[1:11:19] we need to be aware of these these
[1:11:21] things we need to be always aware that
[1:11:24] satan's going to always try to strike us
[1:11:26] and if we ain't
[1:11:28] focused like we should be it will make
[1:11:30] it easy for him
[1:11:39] now i got a
[1:11:41] few verses here um
[1:11:51] all right uh what one corinthians 10 12
[1:11:55] to 14 if you would turn with me
[1:12:06] wherefore
[1:12:07] let him that thinketh he standeth take
[1:12:10] he lest he fall that there hath no
[1:12:13] temptation taken you but such
[1:12:17] as is common to man
[1:12:19] but god is faithful who will not suffer
[1:12:22] you to be tempted above that you're able
[1:12:25] but we
[1:12:26] but will
[1:12:29] with the temptation also make a way to
[1:12:32] escape that ye may be able to bear it
[1:12:35] wherefore my daily beloved flee from
[1:12:38] idolatry
[1:12:43] and that's what it is
[1:12:44] distractions
[1:12:47] become
[1:12:49] idolatry if we let it
[1:12:52] these distractions like there there's
[1:12:55] some people that that will sit and watch
[1:12:57] tv all day
[1:12:59] and and um not bother to pick up this
[1:13:02] bible or to read it or maybe even and uh
[1:13:06] she
[1:13:08] he could say whatever
[1:13:10] could say um well
[1:13:12] i i do read
[1:13:14] like
[1:13:15] a little bit
[1:13:16] uh
[1:13:17] you know like at the end of the day
[1:13:20] but the rest of the day watching is
[1:13:22] sitting down
[1:13:24] watching tv on god
[1:13:27] and we we just do these things we just
[1:13:30] put god to the side and and and have it
[1:13:33] as a side thing where
[1:13:35] we're
[1:13:36] focused on on worldly things and then on
[1:13:39] the side we follow god
[1:13:42] we we do on the side we and we we get
[1:13:45] that way sometimes
[1:13:46] where where we focus on on god on the
[1:13:49] side it's just a side thing
[1:13:52] where um our main focus is on a job or
[1:13:55] on a on something else
[1:13:59] and this will be a side thing god
[1:14:01] doesn't want to be a side job but of
[1:14:04] that that you
[1:14:05] you focus on god
[1:14:08] part of your life he wants to be in all
[1:14:11] of your life
[1:14:12] in everything and focus on god
[1:14:16] and and those that do focus on god god
[1:14:19] are
[1:14:21] blessed usually because
[1:14:24] blessed are those that seek god
[1:14:27] and this verse
[1:14:29] lamentations 3 25 the lord is good unto
[1:14:32] them that wait for him to the soul that
[1:14:34] seeketh him
[1:14:36] so if we we wonder why
[1:14:39] why god is is uh it seems like god's
[1:14:42] just putting me to the side and i'm just
[1:14:45] a side thing that god deals with what
[1:14:47] are you doing when you put god to the
[1:14:49] side and you say god ain't listening to
[1:14:51] your prayers and budding and focusing on
[1:14:53] you maybe we need to focus on god more
[1:14:56] because if we ain't focusing on god
[1:14:59] enough and we're focusing on these other
[1:15:01] things then
[1:15:02] then how how is who is god to fight to
[1:15:06] um
[1:15:08] to
[1:15:10] how is god to answer your prayers when
[1:15:12] you ain't and praying enough and you
[1:15:15] ain't focusing on god enough and and you
[1:15:18] putting him to the side
[1:15:20] even though we do these things
[1:15:22] god is still faithful
[1:15:24] even though we put him to this side and
[1:15:27] stuff he'll stay
[1:15:29] telling prayers when
[1:15:30] when in reality we're just being
[1:15:32] impatient he hasn't answered it yet he
[1:15:33] will answer in his own timing
[1:15:38] and
[1:15:39] but we get get that way sometimes we we
[1:15:42] put god as a a side a side thing that we
[1:15:46] do do on the side and we focus on god on
[1:15:49] the side and and we don't need to do
[1:15:52] that we need to focus on god more
[1:15:54] instead of this instead of focusing on
[1:15:56] him on the on the side he's not a side
[1:16:00] job he wants to be
[1:16:01] he wants to be surrounding our entire
[1:16:04] life
[1:16:05] that that
[1:16:06] we need to to meditate on him daily
[1:16:10] not on these other things we get our
[1:16:13] thoughts are full of what's going on in
[1:16:15] the day
[1:16:16] time what's happening at work and what's
[1:16:19] what's going on
[1:16:21] and stuff
[1:16:22] god wants to be a part of all of our our
[1:16:25] thoughts he wants
[1:16:26] when we see when we love something
[1:16:30] we
[1:16:31] think about it and when when we
[1:16:34] love something so much we'll focus on it
[1:16:38] and if we love god we'll focus on god so
[1:16:41] so those that that say i don't got time
[1:16:44] to focus on god
[1:16:46] you can make time
[1:16:48] you can if you can make time to watch
[1:16:50] television and do what you want you can
[1:16:52] most definitely make time to to to focus
[1:16:55] on god
[1:17:07] 1 1 chronicles 16 10 and to 11
[1:17:12] glory in his holy name let the heart of
[1:17:15] them rejoice that seek the lord seek the
[1:17:17] lord and his strength seek his face
[1:17:20] continually
[1:17:22] amen we need to seek god continually
[1:17:25] that's what the what the bible says we
[1:17:27] should do we should do that we should
[1:17:29] constantly
[1:17:30] seek god with all that we have in all of
[1:17:34] our strength we we pray
[1:17:36] god let me be in your perfect will let
[1:17:38] me let me do what you want me to do let
[1:17:41] me
[1:17:42] um get in your perfect will
[1:17:45] well if we want to get in his perfect
[1:17:47] will
[1:17:48] his perfect will is for us to focus on
[1:17:50] him fully
[1:17:51] focus on him first focus on him with all
[1:17:55] all the time that we can because time is
[1:17:58] running out as well there might may come
[1:18:00] a time when when they try to take this
[1:18:02] bible away from us and they try to try
[1:18:04] to tell us we can't focus on god and
[1:18:07] tell us that we we can't do these things
[1:18:10] i don't know when the end that's going
[1:18:11] to happen then
[1:18:13] but but god does and
[1:18:17] and we need to focus on god as much as
[1:18:19] we can because that that's how we get
[1:18:21] closer to god read the bible and pray
[1:18:25] that's how we get closer to him so if we
[1:18:28] read the bible and pray every single day
[1:18:30] then then we know every everything will
[1:18:33] be all right and we begin to worry less
[1:18:36] we begin to get closer to god and we
[1:18:38] begin to
[1:18:39] to um
[1:18:41] and to have that peace that passes
[1:18:43] understanding if all of our attention is
[1:18:45] focused on god and if
[1:18:47] and if we've been born again then our
[1:18:50] desires will be to focus on god with
[1:18:52] everything we got and we will desire to
[1:18:55] do these things we will desire to focus
[1:18:58] on god instead of instead of these other
[1:19:00] things sometimes we we we just get so
[1:19:03] caught up in these things though and and
[1:19:06] and our focus becomes on these other
[1:19:08] things when they
[1:19:10] they shouldn't be and and these other
[1:19:13] things are merely distractions anything
[1:19:15] that that is distracting you from god
[1:19:18] that brings your attention away from god
[1:19:20] is a distraction and we need to get back
[1:19:22] focused on god
[1:19:31] and sometimes
[1:19:33] we'll
[1:19:35] we'll do that without even noticing
[1:19:37] and what we'll begin to
[1:19:39] to look at
[1:19:40] um
[1:19:42] you know what's going on and i mean
[1:19:45] that's that's all right
[1:19:47] but i'm saying is i'm not saying you
[1:19:51] can't go on on your phone and you can't
[1:19:54] do these things but i'm saying when it
[1:19:56] when it becomes a higher priority than
[1:20:00] god and it becomes a distraction that
[1:20:03] you're
[1:20:04] no longer fully focused on god that's
[1:20:07] when you need to
[1:20:08] when need to put this
[1:20:10] away sometimes and and for me it really
[1:20:14] does it really does become a distraction
[1:20:16] sometimes even for me
[1:20:19] because
[1:20:21] um
[1:20:23] because i'll have like
[1:20:25] um when so many notifications come up
[1:20:28] and all that and i want to see all the
[1:20:30] likes i got a post and stuff and we we
[1:20:33] get we get those those dopamine highs
[1:20:36] from
[1:20:37] from
[1:20:38] looking at
[1:20:40] the likes that we got and all that stuff
[1:20:42] i mean dope the word dopamine
[1:20:45] um if you don't know what that means
[1:20:46] that means
[1:20:48] a
[1:20:48] pleasure hormone we get it from drinking
[1:20:51] water we get
[1:20:53] we we get it from um
[1:20:56] from anything that we enjoy doing so
[1:20:59] there's nothing wrong with getting
[1:21:01] dopamine it's just getting in the wrong
[1:21:04] things too too much and it becomes an
[1:21:06] addiction
[1:21:08] in
[1:21:09] and
[1:21:10] see
[1:21:12] i had to put a restriction on myself i
[1:21:15] put screen time on on in the settings
[1:21:18] because i got tired of it becoming a
[1:21:20] distraction
[1:21:21] and
[1:21:22] and me focusing on that and i'll be like
[1:21:24] okay i'm just going to scroll through
[1:21:27] instagram just a few minutes turns into
[1:21:29] an hour or something that's how it get
[1:21:31] that's how it goes sometimes
[1:21:33] when you get like that and if if only
[1:21:37] we could could get get like that about
[1:21:40] reading the bible and stop it from
[1:21:42] deciding i'm going to read the bible for
[1:21:45] um a few minutes and then it turns into
[1:21:47] an hour and and i'm going to pray and
[1:21:50] then it turns into an hour or two hours
[1:21:53] or where however long
[1:21:55] it's
[1:21:56] it's a whole lot better to be addicted
[1:21:58] to the bible and addicted to following
[1:22:00] god and addicted to to seeking god
[1:22:03] that's the
[1:22:04] addiction i want
[1:22:07] to get to get closer to god with
[1:22:10] following the scriptures and and
[1:22:13] seeking god with all of our heart
[1:22:15] and and
[1:22:16] we we see that that verse a lot of
[1:22:18] people misinterpreted that um if
[1:22:22] if uh
[1:22:23] i forget what it's
[1:22:25] it is uh says specifically but i think
[1:22:27] it it says um
[1:22:29] uh yeah it says delight yourself in the
[1:22:32] lord and and uh you will get your
[1:22:34] heart's desire
[1:22:36] and
[1:22:37] but but some people think oh
[1:22:40] oh if i delight myself in the lord i'm
[1:22:42] going to get this really nice
[1:22:44] lamborghini and i'm going to get this
[1:22:45] big manchester no
[1:22:48] no
[1:22:49] you ain't going to get
[1:22:51] those things that doesn't mean that it
[1:22:53] means that
[1:22:55] when you delight yourself in the lord
[1:22:57] your once will will be what what he
[1:23:00] wants for you and then you'll get those
[1:23:02] things that god wants for you because
[1:23:05] because
[1:23:06] you've
[1:23:07] your hearts your heart will change
[1:23:10] our hearts will will change if we
[1:23:12] delight ourself in the lord and we'll
[1:23:14] want what he wants for us and we'll well
[1:23:16] that's that's that'll be our full
[1:23:19] our only desire is to the perfect will
[1:23:22] of god to be done in our lives and and
[1:23:25] that's what delight yourself and the
[1:23:27] lord will do and you'll get your heart's
[1:23:29] desire because your heart's desire will
[1:23:31] be his will in your life
[1:23:38] amen
[1:23:43] but we get so
[1:23:46] caught up with these other things
[1:23:49] we get so consumed by these other things
[1:23:52] that and then it may not be sinful but
[1:23:54] if it gets our attention
[1:23:56] over following god it becomes sinful
[1:24:12] just give me a second
[1:24:17] i guess sorry i said all my notes
[1:24:20] okay uh i got um william brandon's
[1:24:24] quotes here
[1:24:28] here's a quote by william brandon that's
[1:24:30] the thing that broke the fellowship in
[1:24:31] eden is because
[1:24:33] that
[1:24:34] eve failed to keep the focus of her
[1:24:37] looking on god's word and listen to the
[1:24:39] reasonings of the enemy see
[1:24:42] see if if she she just stayed right with
[1:24:45] god
[1:24:46] said so that settles it god and god said
[1:24:49] so but but she didn't want to do that
[1:24:52] see she changed the focus of her class
[1:24:55] and begin to see
[1:24:56] instead of being just one way
[1:25:01] that there become two ways
[1:25:03] and see we we do that sometimes what
[1:25:06] ends we we change our focus
[1:25:10] our focus
[1:25:12] at first we might have our focus on god
[1:25:15] he's going great and all that and and
[1:25:17] then and then other things will come up
[1:25:20] maybe god will bless you
[1:25:22] okay and then you focus too much on that
[1:25:24] blessing that you begin to stop focusing
[1:25:27] on god and then things will start
[1:25:28] crashing down because
[1:25:31] as maybe it's god trying to bring your
[1:25:33] attention back to him again
[1:25:35] and and we we do that sometimes we focus
[1:25:39] on these other things that do not matter
[1:25:41] and we we begin to look at these other
[1:25:44] things you know and and our focus
[1:25:47] is off of the things that should be on
[1:25:50] and i should be on god and focusing on
[1:25:53] god and sometimes he'll he'll do that to
[1:25:55] us and we'll he'll bring us to a place
[1:25:58] where it might be even even be as bad as
[1:26:01] the place where job was at where he he
[1:26:04] was as in the worst place he could be
[1:26:06] but he focused back on god again so if
[1:26:09] if we we do that
[1:26:11] and we start him drift our focus starts
[1:26:13] drifting god might try and bring our
[1:26:16] attention back to him and by bringing
[1:26:19] something like that to happy you might
[1:26:21] wonder why is god letting this happen to
[1:26:24] me why is why is that this curse come
[1:26:26] upon me it seems like why am i no longer
[1:26:29] being blessed because you're focusing on
[1:26:31] the blessings rather than focusing on
[1:26:33] god
[1:26:34] oh my and that's what we do sometimes we
[1:26:38] need to get back to focusing on god
[1:26:43] we
[1:26:44] oh my we
[1:26:45] we need to get
[1:26:47] back to that place where he's our only
[1:26:49] focus
[1:26:50] that that these other things don't
[1:26:52] matter
[1:26:53] these other things that don't matter
[1:26:55] won't take our focus and we'll we'll
[1:26:59] start thinking about god again and we'll
[1:27:01] start focusing on god again like we
[1:27:04] should
[1:27:06] but but we
[1:27:07] we don't
[1:27:09] we don't always do that
[1:27:11] because sometimes a distraction might
[1:27:14] seem important to us
[1:27:16] we really you know we like this maybe it
[1:27:20] could be someone that you're constantly
[1:27:22] texting all the time that can be
[1:27:24] distraction
[1:27:26] could you imagine
[1:27:27] um you you're praying to god all the
[1:27:30] time and then and then all of a sudden
[1:27:33] maybe uh for me or for for a young
[1:27:37] person you begin to start texting that
[1:27:39] person all the time and you're texting
[1:27:41] that person almost all night and then
[1:27:43] you begin to start forgetting to focus
[1:27:46] on god
[1:27:47] and that's what that's what we do
[1:27:49] sometimes that's that's what we do
[1:27:52] sometimes and
[1:27:54] young young people do that all the time
[1:27:56] text people so much that they're all
[1:27:59] they're thinking about is their
[1:28:00] girlfriend
[1:28:02] all they think about their girlfriend
[1:28:04] because they love them so much and and
[1:28:06] we love them so much that it it takes
[1:28:09] all of our attention and all of our
[1:28:10] focus that it becomes a distraction and
[1:28:14] if god is at the center of that
[1:28:16] relationship it will fall apart because
[1:28:19] god demands all of our attention he
[1:28:21] demands every bit of our attention and
[1:28:24] if we we're getting so focused on these
[1:28:26] other things like that we we begin to to
[1:28:30] to go off of god's perfect will and
[1:28:33] because our tent our test
[1:28:36] is tucked in by something else
[1:28:42] and and we we do that i'm not i'm not
[1:28:45] sick by the way i was just sick last
[1:28:47] week and i was getting get mucus and
[1:28:48] stuff
[1:28:51] but but that's what that's what we do
[1:28:54] we we always do that because because we
[1:28:58] our attention goes to what we love and
[1:29:00] when
[1:29:01] our attention goes to what we love and
[1:29:03] we begin to love something more than god
[1:29:06] then we'll focus on these other things
[1:29:08] instead of focusing happy all of our
[1:29:11] focus focus
[1:29:12] on god we need to get back focus on god
[1:29:16] not our girlfriends i mean sure
[1:29:18] sure your focus can be
[1:29:20] you have to even it out you can't just
[1:29:23] have all your attention to you your
[1:29:25] girlfriend or your if you're a girl
[1:29:27] boyfriend or something like that once
[1:29:29] you're all your tension is is like that
[1:29:31] and you're no longer giving all your
[1:29:34] attention to god that becomes your idol
[1:29:37] when we do that
[1:29:39] and i i got this this um
[1:29:41] another verse
[1:29:43] as wrote down
[1:29:45] it's
[1:29:46] and it's about
[1:29:47] um distracted i put wrote down here
[1:29:50] distracted because of marriage
[1:29:52] there is a difference
[1:29:54] this is what paul said 1 corinthians 7
[1:29:57] 34 to 35
[1:29:59] there is a difference also between a
[1:30:01] wife and a
[1:30:03] a virgin an unmarried woman careth for
[1:30:05] the things of the
[1:30:07] of the lord and she that she may be
[1:30:09] whole both holy
[1:30:12] holy both in body and in spirit
[1:30:15] and and she that is married
[1:30:17] careth for the things of the world how
[1:30:21] she may please her husband and in this i
[1:30:24] speak for your own prophet not that i
[1:30:26] may cast a snare upon you but
[1:30:29] but for
[1:30:31] for that which is comely
[1:30:33] and and that ye may attend upon the lord
[1:30:36] without distraction
[1:30:38] see so even a marriage a distraction
[1:30:41] that's how it is
[1:30:43] and sometimes sometimes when you get
[1:30:45] married your your own spouse becomes a
[1:30:48] distraction and that's why he said here
[1:30:51] because you're always always focused on
[1:30:53] your wife and stuff but there's has to
[1:30:55] be a balance there has to be a balance
[1:30:58] there you have to still focus on god
[1:31:01] more than these other things and
[1:31:03] constantly be thinking about god if
[1:31:05] you're constantly thinking about the
[1:31:07] other person or these other things then
[1:31:09] then
[1:31:10] our distre our focus
[1:31:14] goes on on things that
[1:31:18] sorry that don't matter as much
[1:31:22] see
[1:31:22] what we do that and that's why even in
[1:31:25] marriage is it says it says it's better
[1:31:29] to say stay single basically than to get
[1:31:32] married because because your focus will
[1:31:34] stay on god i'm i'm not saying no you
[1:31:37] should stay single
[1:31:38] but
[1:31:39] but
[1:31:41] but if it becomes
[1:31:42] so much of it as a distraction that
[1:31:45] you're not focusing on god as much
[1:31:50] then then you need to write and get back
[1:31:52] on god again because that's what
[1:31:55] truly matters
[1:31:56] not these other things that like that i
[1:32:00] mean
[1:32:02] we we do do that sometimes we we get so
[1:32:06] caught up with the other things like i
[1:32:08] mean uh if you're you're um
[1:32:11] uh just get married or something go on a
[1:32:14] honeymoon and stuff and you you'll focus
[1:32:16] on on
[1:32:18] your spouse
[1:32:22] excuse
[1:32:25] and me that's that's what we'll
[1:32:28] we we do
[1:32:29] when we love someone of course that
[1:32:31] that's all right and and that's how how
[1:32:34] we
[1:32:35] what we do we focus on the ones we love
[1:32:39] and we give them all of our attention
[1:32:41] and we focus on on the the people that
[1:32:44] we love we we go to our uh visit our
[1:32:48] parents or grandparents or and stuff
[1:32:50] because
[1:32:51] we want to see them and and you think
[1:32:53] about people you love and you pray for
[1:32:55] them and and we we do that and sometimes
[1:32:59] we forget to focus on god when he's the
[1:33:01] most important he's more important than
[1:33:03] any of these things if you put but
[1:33:07] people above god than your earth you're
[1:33:11] idolizing them
[1:33:13] anything you put before god you're
[1:33:14] idolizing them anything anything that uh
[1:33:18] demands your attention more than and god
[1:33:20] didn't give them and that attention
[1:33:22] more than in god then and it can become
[1:33:25] an idol if you
[1:33:27] if you go too far that way and and we do
[1:33:30] that
[1:33:31] and we do that all the time and and
[1:33:34] sometimes we can't help it because
[1:33:36] that's
[1:33:37] how we are that's human nature we focus
[1:33:39] on these things and and we we get so
[1:33:42] focused on on other things and
[1:33:47] and sometimes like a uh a hunter when a
[1:33:51] hunter goes um
[1:33:53] and the hunter goes hunting
[1:33:55] if if he isn't
[1:33:57] and uh
[1:33:58] focus on on uh his hunt focus on the
[1:34:01] deer
[1:34:02] then then the deer is probably gonna get
[1:34:04] away
[1:34:05] and
[1:34:06] and so so we have they focus on our
[1:34:10] target what is our our target
[1:34:13] when when we're trying to
[1:34:15] focus on something get closer to god
[1:34:18] and and stay focused stay focused on god
[1:34:21] if you won't get closer to god don't let
[1:34:23] these distractions overtake all your
[1:34:25] time
[1:34:26] and and that that's what we do
[1:34:29] we we let these distractions and so
[1:34:32] forth overtake all of our time
[1:34:42] and uh here's another quote by brother
[1:34:45] branham disappointments happened to show
[1:34:47] victory oh if we could only see that see
[1:34:51] you'd only see that these things that
[1:34:54] seems to be hurting
[1:34:56] it seems to be burying you and upsetting
[1:34:58] you these are trials they are things to
[1:35:01] stand still focus your glasses on the
[1:35:03] word of god and speak the word and then
[1:35:06] just walk forward and that's all there
[1:35:09] is to it
[1:35:15] and uh
[1:35:17] another another quote
[1:35:19] we got our we got to get ourselves
[1:35:21] focused till whether we live or die sink
[1:35:23] or down it's calvary christ that's the
[1:35:26] thing that god wants us to come back to
[1:35:31] we need to get back focused on god we
[1:35:34] need we need to get get all of our
[1:35:36] attention
[1:35:37] and i don't care if it's just a little
[1:35:40] bit more time that you focus on on
[1:35:43] reading the bible and focusing on god
[1:35:45] more if it's the it's the little things
[1:35:47] that count too if you don't if you miss
[1:35:49] out on the little things always to see
[1:35:51] all the big things and and that's that's
[1:35:54] what we we do and we think
[1:35:57] um
[1:35:58] you know
[1:35:59] maybe a few more minutes reading the
[1:36:01] bible maybe a a little bit of time in
[1:36:04] your day lunch or a time or something to
[1:36:07] to pray a little bit more to see god a
[1:36:09] little bit more
[1:36:11] that's what we need to do we need even
[1:36:13] in the little things just a little so
[1:36:15] closer to god just a little bit more
[1:36:17] focusing on god just
[1:36:19] a little more if only we could do that
[1:36:22] and then a little more the next day than
[1:36:24] that day and then a little more and a
[1:36:26] little more until until our focus
[1:36:28] becomes fully on god again instead of on
[1:36:32] these other things because as
[1:36:35] where our attention and gets
[1:36:37] our attention satan wants our attention
[1:36:40] if he can get our attention then then he
[1:36:42] can get us off the path that we should
[1:36:44] be on because
[1:36:46] because he
[1:36:48] satan demands attention and god demands
[1:36:51] our attention and and they're both
[1:36:53] fighting for our attention but we
[1:36:55] we often choose is to focus on the
[1:36:58] things of this world and stuff like
[1:37:00] these devices and stuff over god because
[1:37:04] we are flesh enjoys doing it and if it
[1:37:07] seems not sinful to do that then we'll
[1:37:09] do that all right because we don't we
[1:37:11] don't want to sin we don't want to sin
[1:37:15] but we we want to
[1:37:17] you know we don't want to sin but if
[1:37:18] it's like something that don't really
[1:37:20] matter but if it's getting all your
[1:37:21] attention then you you might be
[1:37:23] idolizing it
[1:37:25] it could be very small and and um very
[1:37:31] hey subtle with that satan does that and
[1:37:34] sometimes he'll go a little step by step
[1:37:36] a little focus more on these other
[1:37:38] things focus more on
[1:37:41] going on facebook and and doing these
[1:37:44] other things focus a little bit more on
[1:37:46] that and you know because let's say you
[1:37:49] know whisper in your ear
[1:37:50] you know you like doing those things
[1:37:52] more than reading the bible
[1:37:54] you know you like to doing these things
[1:37:56] more than following god turning on an
[1:37:59] episode on disney plus or something
[1:38:02] right rather than following god seems
[1:38:04] innocent and everything
[1:38:06] to do that
[1:38:08] it's just it's just um
[1:38:10] a little bit of
[1:38:11] um
[1:38:12] you know
[1:38:13] something to
[1:38:15] to um
[1:38:17] to get your mind off of work or
[1:38:18] something you know
[1:38:20] it's just
[1:38:21] even in the little things satan will get
[1:38:23] us
[1:38:24] in the little things
[1:38:26] he'll be focused on the little things
[1:38:28] because because we know it's just small
[1:38:32] and and if we think it's just small
[1:38:34] uh we think oh it's okay and then it
[1:38:36] becomes more and more and more it
[1:38:39] demands more of our attention more of
[1:38:41] our attention until well we we've
[1:38:44] fully
[1:38:45] forgotten to to read the bible and it
[1:38:48] becomes like at the end of the day okay
[1:38:50] let me just get my bible out real quick
[1:38:51] it's like what time is it
[1:38:53] it's oh it's almost midnight i better
[1:38:56] reverse real quick and then every
[1:38:59] goes in one ear not the other
[1:39:02] and then you think well at least i read
[1:39:04] what
[1:39:06] at the bible tonight and then they go oh
[1:39:08] i gotta pray as well i mean it's late
[1:39:10] and stuff i still gotta pray because you
[1:39:11] know you do every single night and then
[1:39:13] and then you just have a simple little
[1:39:14] prayer that that
[1:39:17] and then it becomes where you're not not
[1:39:20] in a conversation with god you're not
[1:39:22] talking about what happened in the day
[1:39:24] it's just a little prayer because you're
[1:39:25] tired and then you go to bed
[1:39:28] that's that's how it how it becomes
[1:39:30] where we put we put god at the the last
[1:39:33] thing that we do in the day we put god
[1:39:35] in as a little
[1:39:38] small thing up to the side
[1:39:42] i have this big job to do or something
[1:39:44] and
[1:39:45] then you wake up in the morning and it's
[1:39:47] like you gotta rush around and get ready
[1:39:50] and then you you just like i said read a
[1:39:53] little verse because in one year and out
[1:39:55] the other or something and then and then
[1:39:57] uh
[1:39:58] and then and uh say a simple little
[1:40:01] prayer and you get out the door and go
[1:40:02] to work because because you're running
[1:40:04] behind
[1:40:06] and and
[1:40:07] we we did we do those things and we
[1:40:10] we don't think about them but
[1:40:12] the little things do do count at least
[1:40:15] you put in the effort to do something i
[1:40:18] mean some people just get right out of
[1:40:20] bed and and just go to work and or go to
[1:40:23] sleep and forget to pray and read the
[1:40:25] bible at least you're doing something
[1:40:28] but but if that little small thing is
[1:40:30] the only thing you do every single day
[1:40:32] it's just a small thing like that every
[1:40:35] day and and um he isn't our main focus
[1:40:38] and throughout the day we're always
[1:40:40] focused on other things and never
[1:40:42] thinking about god
[1:40:44] and then
[1:40:45] it becomes a side thing following god
[1:40:48] this christian thing becomes a side
[1:40:50] thing
[1:40:52] and that's that's what what
[1:40:54] happens to it
[1:40:56] to too many believers there's i mean
[1:40:58] there's there's people
[1:41:00] in baptist churches and stuff that the
[1:41:04] entire church goes to church on sunday
[1:41:07] and the next next day
[1:41:09] everything in the sermon goes in one of
[1:41:11] you not the other and then and then they
[1:41:13] begin living the the same old life
[1:41:15] they've always been living and don't
[1:41:17] change and just smoke and drink and all
[1:41:20] these other things because there there's
[1:41:22] the this
[1:41:23] they call it this christian thing their
[1:41:25] side thing they do on sunday
[1:41:28] and do it on sunday and go maybe
[1:41:30] sometimes on wednesdays and sometimes we
[1:41:31] do that in the entire week we just
[1:41:35] read a couple
[1:41:37] of scriptures or something in the bible
[1:41:39] pray a simple prayer every single day
[1:41:41] and then and then um
[1:41:43] go throughout the day like
[1:41:45] and focus on other things and then and
[1:41:48] then on sunday you focus on god
[1:41:51] just on sunday just on on the weekend
[1:41:53] just on on wednesday maybe and sometimes
[1:41:56] we we do this we get we get so
[1:41:59] focused on on what's going on in our
[1:42:01] lives
[1:42:02] in the weekly
[1:42:04] like every single day
[1:42:05] and then and then only focus on
[1:42:08] god on sundays
[1:42:11] that's what a lot of people do a lot of
[1:42:14] people do that
[1:42:16] and then they claim the title christian
[1:42:18] and whatever but
[1:42:21] but they focus on god if they focus on
[1:42:24] god
[1:42:24] then they don't really love god
[1:42:28] if they if they ain't always thinking
[1:42:30] about god and thinking about these other
[1:42:33] things that shows which they and what
[1:42:35] things you love the most is what you
[1:42:37] think about the most
[1:42:41] and and that's why the bible says we are
[1:42:43] to to
[1:42:45] we should meditate on these things
[1:42:47] daily that just like that verse i i i
[1:42:50] read earlier
[1:42:53] in in his law doth he meditate day and
[1:42:56] night
[1:42:58] and and he shall be like a tree planted
[1:43:00] by the
[1:43:01] rivers of water that that bringeth forth
[1:43:04] his fruit and his season in his leaf
[1:43:06] also oh shall not wither and whatsoever
[1:43:10] he doeth shall prosper
[1:43:12] amen
[1:43:13] that and that's where we need we need to
[1:43:16] get to where where
[1:43:18] we're planted by by the rivers of water
[1:43:21] when our where it gets so focused on god
[1:43:24] and seek god with all of our hearts and
[1:43:27] we're every single day instead of just
[1:43:30] saying uh god thank you for this day um
[1:43:33] i pray that that uh everything goes all
[1:43:35] right amen
[1:43:36] instead you get on your knees and pray
[1:43:40] out to god and say god i pray that that
[1:43:42] your will is done my life god i pray
[1:43:44] that that you'll let your will be done
[1:43:47] and and actually seek god and actually
[1:43:50] try to serve him instead of
[1:43:52] being
[1:43:54] so
[1:43:55] focused on the day-to-day life that what
[1:43:57] happened at work i hope this person
[1:44:00] doesn't um do what they did the all the
[1:44:02] other weeks be really annoying whatever
[1:44:05] and
[1:44:08] and and uh and actually they think about
[1:44:11] god on a daily basis and instead of
[1:44:13] thinking about that person being really
[1:44:15] annoying and whatever they're so
[1:44:17] annoying
[1:44:18] instead you pray for them and and say
[1:44:21] god help them to not be so annoying
[1:44:23] maybe
[1:44:25] and and and uh just be real kind to them
[1:44:28] in in every thing and and not not be
[1:44:31] like just try to ignore them all the
[1:44:33] time because they're so annoying
[1:44:37] and and so
[1:44:40] once you once you become so focused on
[1:44:42] god that people people at work begins to
[1:44:46] to notice it they'll notice it they
[1:44:48] always always do
[1:44:50] when all your thoughts are on god even
[1:44:52] when you're working whatever you're
[1:44:53] doing you're always thinking about god
[1:44:55] anything like man i remember that verse
[1:44:58] and or
[1:44:59] other people are just like oh i remember
[1:45:02] that post that funny post
[1:45:04] on on instagram or something i read last
[1:45:07] night that's so funny instead instead
[1:45:09] you think um
[1:45:11] it's that you think about
[1:45:13] you think about god and those those
[1:45:16] verses that you read this morning and
[1:45:18] you think about uh man god is so good
[1:45:21] instead of instead of being so focused
[1:45:23] on these other things like that and
[1:45:26] you're always thinking about god and
[1:45:29] always thinking about
[1:45:30] doing his perfect will and stuff and and
[1:45:33] just talking about god that's that's
[1:45:35] where i got to that point when i i i was
[1:45:38] at work and i began to always talk about
[1:45:41] god i always wanted to talk about god
[1:45:42] and people said so
[1:45:44] why why are you always talking about god
[1:45:47] all the time
[1:45:48] why don't why don't you talk about other
[1:45:50] things and or they'll tell me
[1:45:53] you uh if you want to preach why don't
[1:45:56] you just be a preacher that's what they
[1:45:58] told me
[1:46:00] and
[1:46:01] i said i mean
[1:46:04] i don't i don't know it's just what
[1:46:06] god's timing that that's that's why i
[1:46:09] said because
[1:46:10] um i would always talk about god and
[1:46:13] they didn't always like that
[1:46:15] but
[1:46:15] that that's all i could think about i
[1:46:17] mean that's all i wanted to talk about
[1:46:19] these other people talking about other
[1:46:21] things
[1:46:22] i always want to talk about god i don't
[1:46:24] want to say how how great i am for doing
[1:46:26] that because i know how many times i
[1:46:28] focus on other things instead
[1:46:31] but
[1:46:32] but and then i can focus on on work and
[1:46:35] stuff but when i can and i always i
[1:46:39] tried to
[1:46:40] to think about god all the time because
[1:46:43] because that that is what what um
[1:46:46] that is who i love the most and he's
[1:46:49] he's my savior he he's he's my my king i
[1:46:52] i should focus on him because i love him
[1:46:56] and and we need to get like that we
[1:46:58] think about him all the time because
[1:47:01] we're thinking about how good he is to
[1:47:02] us how how great god is
[1:47:05] and when we do that we get closer to him
[1:47:08] and we get closer to his perfect will
[1:47:11] for our life and and we need to get
[1:47:14] more like that
[1:47:16] amen
[1:47:18] we
[1:47:18] we need to get closer to god and and
[1:47:22] to be
[1:47:24] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:47:26] water
[1:47:27] amen
[1:47:31] and and
[1:47:32] in that verse that i read this morning
[1:47:34] let thine eyes look right on and let
[1:47:36] thine eyelids look straight forth ponder
[1:47:39] them
[1:47:41] and let all thy ways be established turn
[1:47:44] not to the right hand nor to the left
[1:47:46] remove thy foot from evil
[1:47:49] sometimes we'll do that we have our foot
[1:47:52] on on one one thing okay focus on god
[1:47:55] here and then
[1:47:57] we're going to focus on god over here i
[1:47:59] mean focus on the world over here focus
[1:48:01] on god over there on the side and we we
[1:48:04] we begin to
[1:48:05] and when we do that
[1:48:07] we're we're taking one one foot
[1:48:10] on on the things of the world we're
[1:48:12] saying okay let's focus on that on and
[1:48:14] then we'll focus on god on the side
[1:48:17] don't need to do that we need to focus
[1:48:20] fully on god and instead of being so
[1:48:22] caught up with these worldly things and
[1:48:24] that's what we do
[1:48:25] these things like that instagram
[1:48:27] facebook and all that is worldly stuff
[1:48:29] and we get so caught up with those
[1:48:31] things that that our focus drifts from
[1:48:34] god and it becomes on these other things
[1:48:36] and we need to get our focus back on god
[1:48:43] amen
[1:48:45] we need to get our focus back on god
[1:48:50] man um
[1:48:52] another quote by uh
[1:48:54] brother branham
[1:48:56] uh then this quite long one
[1:48:59] oh my goodness okay
[1:49:00] um
[1:49:03] now now listen real close
[1:49:06] mark faith now don't forget to get this
[1:49:08] now faith is designed to see what god
[1:49:10] wills and wants there is no knowledge
[1:49:13] that can do
[1:49:14] that
[1:49:15] faith alone is designed
[1:49:17] and get to and give to the human race
[1:49:22] to find out what the will of god is and
[1:49:26] you take your faith with a word then
[1:49:28] leave it alone you got the wrong faith
[1:49:32] but when in your
[1:49:33] god-given faith focus you with the word
[1:49:36] of god you're directly in line and
[1:49:39] zeroed
[1:49:40] oh my god help us this hour
[1:49:44] or the great hour that we live in faith
[1:49:47] designed to see what god wants how do
[1:49:50] you see it through the camera of his
[1:49:52] word his promise this is the full
[1:49:54] revelation of jesus christ
[1:49:56] you know um
[1:49:59] that
[1:50:00] when that faith that's in your focus
[1:50:02] you you too this word
[1:50:05] your focus away from all denominations
[1:50:07] and creeds and everything your focus
[1:50:09] right straight on the word of god you're
[1:50:11] zeroed in it only needs a little touch
[1:50:14] off amen that prayer flies straight in
[1:50:16] the presence of god
[1:50:18] then i won't read that whole verse but
[1:50:22] but we need we need to to to focus on on
[1:50:26] uh god more
[1:50:27] amen
[1:50:28] um
[1:50:32] musicians if you come
[1:50:34] sorry
[1:50:42] and then we need to get back folks
[1:50:45] focused with god again man how many
[1:50:48] believes died
[1:50:52] and and we get so so
[1:50:56] distractions and stuff it becomes so so
[1:50:59] that that um
[1:51:01] these these other other things overtake
[1:51:04] time with god and it needs to it needs
[1:51:08] to change amen
[1:51:09] we need to to start to start focusing
[1:51:12] back on god again
[1:51:14] because because i i know myself that i
[1:51:18] haven't been focusing on god like i
[1:51:19] should
[1:51:20] i i need to give him more of my time and
[1:51:24] and and i need to and just really
[1:51:28] really focus on god more and and that's
[1:51:30] why i begin to see this this this week
[1:51:34] um all week as i was preparing to to
[1:51:37] preach and stuff i was thinking how we
[1:51:39] all need to focus on god more and and we
[1:51:42] all need to to be more focused on god
[1:51:46] man uh
[1:51:48] if everyone could bow your heads
[1:51:50] and
[1:51:52] you know i'll just pray lord
[1:51:54] lord god i pray
[1:51:56] that you'll help us to get
[1:51:59] focused back on you again lord god
[1:52:01] because i know sometimes we get so
[1:52:04] caught up on these other things and
[1:52:06] these things in the world lord god
[1:52:09] i know we we do we get so caught up with
[1:52:12] these other things we get so
[1:52:14] focused off of your word lord god and
[1:52:18] lord i'm sorry for that
[1:52:21] i'm sorry for
[1:52:23] not focusing on you like i should lord
[1:52:26] and my hand is rave sword i i know i
[1:52:29] ain't been focused on you like i should
[1:52:32] i know i ain't been focused on you lord
[1:52:34] god i've been looking to these other
[1:52:36] things i've been looking at these other
[1:52:39] things and it's not all sinful that's

[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:53] [Applause]
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:54:03] stand with me
[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:07] [Applause]
[1:54:08] [Music]
[1:54:21] oh
[1:54:24] you mean you love the lord this morning
[1:54:26] amen i think brother danny did good this
[1:54:28] morning don't you
[1:54:30] amen and i tell you what i believe if we
[1:54:32] all searched our heart
[1:54:34] and uh
[1:54:36] and ask ourselves if we actually do what
[1:54:38] that bible says
[1:54:40] how much god has asked us to do it same
[1:54:43] way with joshua remember the book of
[1:54:45] joshua he says you know he was to
[1:54:47] meditate on it day and night and so
[1:54:49] forth
[1:54:50] i believe we're all guilty of getting
[1:54:52] distracted
[1:54:53] way too much i think about myself and
[1:54:56] amen and and having been when i was
[1:54:58] younger like danny
[1:55:00] and irritating
[1:55:01] uh i think it was brother ivan and
[1:55:04] brother
[1:55:05] daniel dennis and irvin and
[1:55:07] and irritating my crew because all i
[1:55:09] would do is talk about god you know and
[1:55:12] and so that's wonder i didn't get fired
[1:55:14] but that was all my heart's desire and
[1:55:16] when i see that in danny you know not
[1:55:18] just to preach but whether he's on the
[1:55:20] job or wherever he is it's what's in
[1:55:21] inside of him he wants that amenities
[1:55:24] you know express that so that's a real
[1:55:27] good thing a real good sign that
[1:55:28] somebody loves the lord
[1:55:30] and i appreciate that amen amen it was
[1:55:32] better than what i expected i won't i
[1:55:35] won't tell him what brother
[1:55:37] branham's pastor told brother madam
[1:55:42] hey man remember brother branham's first
[1:55:44] compliment from his pastor was the worst
[1:55:47] i ever heard
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:51] oh my because brother man said he would
[1:55:54] tell him sad stories had everybody
[1:55:56] boo-hoo and crying oh my did that in the
[1:56:00] other
[1:56:00] and uh what was his pastor's name roy
[1:56:03] davis
[1:56:05] i think roy davis wasn't
[1:56:06] [Music]
[1:56:08] i'm thinking so but anyway he says well
[1:56:10] yeah it's kind of like a lawyer he used
[1:56:12] to be a lawyer and he says yeah he can
[1:56:13] go up there and say to all of us
[1:56:16] this woman was done wrong and just out
[1:56:17] of the other but the lawyer never used
[1:56:20] any word or any law and that's what he
[1:56:22] said about bible is you got to give
[1:56:23] people word amen not just emotion amen
[1:56:26] and so but i think brother danny did
[1:56:28] good don't you
[1:56:29] amen so praise the lord god is good amen
[1:56:32] let's just bow our heads one more time
[1:56:34] lord jesus we do thank you for that
[1:56:36] service this morning lord and i truly do
[1:56:39] believe that you're calling on your
[1:56:40] children father lord not to be
[1:56:42] distracted and not to look from the
[1:56:44] right side or to the left lord because
[1:56:47] of all the inventions because of all the
[1:56:50] uh
[1:56:52] all the different tactics and all the
[1:56:54] different gizmos that the devil has
[1:56:56] and traps that he has set
[1:56:59] lord jesus all the carers that we have
[1:57:01] lord all the pleasures of life all the
[1:57:03] things that's out there lord now more
[1:57:06] than ever we as believers need to watch
[1:57:07] that we are not distracted and that do
[1:57:09] things don't become an idol to us lord
[1:57:12] to where it is more prevalent and more
[1:57:14] dominant in our lives in what you are
[1:57:17] lord do forgive us father for what we
[1:57:19] have failed you lord draw us closer to
[1:57:21] you lord and we know that the only way
[1:57:23] that it will ever get closer to you is
[1:57:24] to read our bible and pray more than
[1:57:27] what we do so lord we ask god you'd help
[1:57:29] us from this day forward lord to focus
[1:57:32] more on you lord we just thank you lord
[1:57:34] jesus for brother daniel for laying it
[1:57:36] on his heart that's what he spoke this
[1:57:38] morning because this is just what we
[1:57:40] have need of the lord once again we ask
[1:57:42] those that are not feeling well lord
[1:57:44] jesus that you would continue to touch
[1:57:46] him and raise him back up lord in the
[1:57:48] name of jesus christ we ask it amen and
