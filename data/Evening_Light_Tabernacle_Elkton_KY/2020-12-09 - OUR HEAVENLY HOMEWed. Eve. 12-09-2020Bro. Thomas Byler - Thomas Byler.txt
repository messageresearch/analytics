bruised and banged up and but we're just thankful the lord kept his hand upon them and the other lady wasn't hurt either so uh just thankful for that and we always have something to be thankful for so we just want to appreciate the lord for that and uh it's kind of sickening to see our tahoe get smashed but they make them every day so i guess we'll be all right there so but anyways we have a lot of prayer requests tonight and i want to remember brother willie and sister natalie tonight and just remember them that the lord had just touched them and also brother stephen called me laster said

will just continue to be with her and uh that stuff is really rampant and i was at a place today picking up a elderly gentleman come in and he said i'm sorry but he said i've had two friends that i've

right that's much better amen praise the lord let's just bow our heads and we'll get right into the word father we come before you lord jesus with thankful hearts once again lord to be able to assemble ourselves lord in your name father according to your will lord and we believe lord jesus tonight that you'll have your way we ask god your perfect will would be done lord jesus and that you would help us lord just to surrender to you that you might say exactly what you once said lord and help me not to say anything out of the way but only that which would be beneficial and that which would be pleasing to you lord and father we asked lord did you open the ears of every hearer tonight father to hear what you have to say to him but you want to speak lord lord we ask god that you just take the thoughts meditation of my heart father and lord just use it and do with it as you see fit father as we open your word we ask god that you would just divinely help us lord jesus to give the interpretation of it and to put it in its correct place lord and not to say anything that would be out of order lord we love you lord and we just thank you and commit this service to you now in jesus christ's name amen amen amen tonight i want to talk about our heavenly home amen our heavenly home amen praise the lord so if you will let's go first of all we'll see what jesus had to say about it in saint john amen saint john 14. chapter 14 verse 1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so i would have told you and i go to prepare a place for you if i go to prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated i just uh gonna preach just the way that this spirit leads me here but i want to read another scripture out of revelations 21 and verse 3. i think that goes along with this real well that where i am there you may be also amen amen how many likes that that where i am there you may be also we see the fulfilling of this over in revelations 21 and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god amen so how many believes the day is coming when we will be with the lord jesus christ we will be with god amen now we already are with him i mean at least we're ready with him jesus says i'm not going to leave you comfortless amen i'll be with you amen even in you unto the end of the world so the spirit of god is with us now amen but i want to start first of all by saying that i mean i've preached this direction before and i've had a brother say well brother you you know you preached like a funeral service amen and i'm like uh you know uh well it kind of is in that direction because of most of the things that we are going to read tonight most of the time i use at a funeral service yeah but you know jesus neither jesus nor paul that i know of or even john the revelator as far as i know was preaching at a funeral when they said these things amen but they had a perspective they had uh they had uh something that they wanted to get across to the people amen and jesus here in the 14th chapter and i don't know just how many chapters there is not all that many 20 21 towers coming definitely coming down towards the end of jesus life you see very little red writing after this you know he's kind of getting ready to leave amen because he was wouldn't be too long before he leaves this world and he was telling his disciples not to let their heart be troubled amen because he was going to prepare a place for him now the one scripture i believe the prophet of god corrected and he talked about the english language and how that in this scripture it didn't really it didn't say it correctly amen he talks about how that in my father's house are many mansions amen and i believe he interpreted if i remember right he says the correct interpretation is in my father's kingdom are many palaces i'm going to remember that that right in my king my father's kingdom are many palaces amen so he's gone to prepare a place and he was telling his disciples that their hearts shouldn't be troubled now how many knows that after jesus left their hearts were truly troubled every one of them was very very troubled i mean and no doubt but jesus knew that this all was coming and so he gave him words of comfort no doubt amen they remembered these scriptures many times but jesus was trying to tell them and give them a perspective and let them know that their heart really doesn't have to be troubled because i'm going to go prepare a place for you and if i go prepare a place for you i'm going to come back and i'm going to receive you unto myself amen how many knows the the fulfilling of that is going to be over in second thessalonians the fourth chapter around the 18th 13th 14th verse maybe somewhere where the lord shall descend with a shout amen that in christ shall rise we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet the lord in the air so how many knows that he that is a fulfilling that he's going to come back they of course didn't know it was going to be 2 000 years later amen i want to talk to you about three houses amen three houses say man three three places that god has given three homes basically three homes that god gives us to live in amen and this is actually uh when you would tell some of this stuff to a denominational person perhaps you know i don't know that they really would believe it amen or see it the way that we see it amen and because we're talking about changing bodies how many believes that we're the kind of people that have a promise of changing bodies amen and so we have different places that we live and so we get so so at home here amen and we don't realize that this is actually just a house that we're living in amen the real man's on the inside amen and i can tell you i remember one thing that brother john steeman said as he got older he was probably not as old as i was when he told me amen back in the day he says you know i may feel old but i still think like a young man i still you know i you know it's just still you feel like the inside is hasn't changed a bit huh amen brother jeff back there not in his head yeah and all of us that are getting older we our bodies might fail our mind skin might wrinkle and we might get older but this inside man you know that's a spirit man it doesn't get old amen it stays the same and that right and so the outward man perish but the inside band stays the same and so i thought that's about right you know because it's just the outside that perishes and one day we're going to take this house and of course we know that this house gets set aside and amen when you tell people that you're going to change bodies one of these days well that's more than a lot of people can comprehend i know where i was come from and where i was born at people and and i'll be honest with you most people probably just don't know where they're going to end up at and tonight's service has to do with course it has to do with where we're going you know right and and that's a great thing to know where you're going amen where we not only do we know where we're going but you and i have been made more clear about where we come from than any other age any other time because it towards the end of brother ministry he got into talking about how that if you're not a seed gene of god i mean you have to be a seed gene of god you have to be there way back when just like you were in your great great great great friend father you each and every one of us were seeing your great great great grandfather you were in him and you come on down come on down come on down and that's the same way it is with god it has to do with your genetics amen of course talking about where we come from but i want to i want to just take a little bit of time let's talk about our first home first amen then we will talk about our second home which is going to be our theophany all right that's our second home is our theophany and i may just go ahead and read a paragraph out of a quote of brother bannon that i'll probably end up reading the whole thing here in a little bit but he says now we've got to have everything in threes to make perfection this is god's only provided place of worship 1965. all right so it was right down towards the end of his ministry he says now see now there's one body here right here where we're at this is the body that we have then that body there okay which is the celestial body okay and then the glorified body all right in the resurrection so those are the three places that he says three bodies that we have see and that makes it complete so and it's not a myth it's not just an idea it's not just the spirit amen it is he says it is a man and a woman like you are just exactly amen so we realize that we've got two we got three different homes we're looking for that right amen at home that is bright and fair and you know sometimes you just i'll tell you i truly believe that you know as a christian you know that there's another place over there but now let me let me just come back let's talk about our first home because that's a house that you're living in right now you're comfortable with it perhaps uh you know it's just you know if people it's all about people live all about the house that they got right here they don't realize amen that one of these days that this house is going to pass away you're not always going to be here folks and people that don't look at that if you don't uh get it in perspective and really begin to think about that and many times brother branham would get try to get people to realize hey you are not always going to stay here this is not your eternal home this is not your permanent dwelling amen this is only a temporary place all right first first hole that we come with come come to we realized brother bam talk about how that when a mama is pregnant with a child and she's fixing to have a child and that fixing that baby's fixing to be born and then that mama might cause and chew and spit and everything else you know but you know he said if that mama even is every ever as mean as she might be amen whenever it gets close to having but that mama will turn sweet and kind and gentle is that right you know what he said why because there's another spirit amen that is waiting there there's a spirit that's waiting there amen to come into that body amen now one place and i'm not here to say that it's your soul because i don't really have the scripture or don't know the scripture well enough to back that up but amen it would seem right because when he god breathed the breath of life into adam he became what a living soul right so but there's a spirit that comes into that body and that spirit that's you all right coming into that body because brother baby says you have never seen me i've never seen you the real you is on the inside all right so that that spirit comes in there after that baby's born if it doesn't take that breath of life of course it's still born and it's dead it has to receive that spirit amen but there's a kindness and there's a sweetness that comes about and i truly believe that's the way that brahm said about a believer also when you are fixing to pass out of this world amen in going to your next home i mean please when you go to your next home people on their deathbed or coming close to that have a tendency to get really sweet really kind huh if you made any mistakes if you've done anything wrong you don't mind humbling yourself say forgive me brother forgive amen you're not going to sit there and say well you know yeah i you know you know forgive me but you did me wrong no no you don't branch in any of that you just want to make sure you're right with god you get sweet and kind humble huh how many i know that's the way we need to live all the time not just when we die or come down to the door of death but you know because you're fixing to change homes again so we come into this this world that we're living in and now we contact this world by what see taste feel hear and smell amen conscience and memory imaginations 10 senses basically that we have to contact this world amen and i'll tell you what i don't know about you brother david but amen when i you know sometimes have to wear glasses and i said lord thank you for being able to see how many glad to be able to see not to walk around but it'd be a terrible place if you couldn't contact this world and then because you have our everything would be dark you might hear people's voices you might be able to touch people you can hear people but if you can't see this world it would really be a drastically different world for you to live in so we're glad for every sense that god gives us amen to contact he give you feelings so that you can feel for people and then he gave you a conscience so you could keep it straight amen you can have a few conscience and have it right because some people's conscience will condemn them so bad they'll blow their brains out because they're so miserable and also god all of those things have to be in line god give that so that we can contact this now how many knows that even in this natural life here that we talk about and we talk about uh maybe uh going into another body and to another into another vessel we know that actually you actually change vessels amen but when you think about even this natural man that we have here amen your your soul who you are amen how many knows that even that man has to become regenerated that person has to become born again amen to enter into the kingdom of god and to receive eternal life amen so here we are the first birth amen if you go out of this world without that we know that there's no other body waiting for you over there amen there's no place for you to go to man because you don't have what that second home ready but if you are a child of god if you're a son or a daughter of god there is a theophany waiting for you amen praise the lord and in that you find out that there's something on the inside of you now brother bam says whenever you're born again that right he says there's a little birth that takes place that inside man and it grows and it grows and he typed it with what a pregnant woman is that right grows to nine months comes to full maturity and it comes time to be delivered amen and as you grow and as you grow and as you grow i believe god has you in a place that you're ready to go home you're ready for your new house isn't that right you know and sometimes we wonder why god takes people huh you know and a lot of times we'll say well they were ready to graduate i was ready to take them home they were ready to go amen uh we even have heard stories of of people that almost drown and come back and find out later that hey you know they weren't ready they weren't quite ready so they were given another time it was their time but they weren't ready so to come back and get ready and go that's the god's grace don't we all pray that god will do that for us that if we're not ready lord don't let me go i want to be ready to go when i go and the thing of it is you know we how many knows human beings we human beings and anybody that isn't born again they completely live by these eyes and by by the sense by their senses and you know basically for what they see lust of the eye loves their flesh and lusted and the pride of life does those three major sins and that's this major thing that people live for never realize you know that there's another world that is so much better than this one amen now let's talk about uh as we go through here we think about when you're born again he says you know and you grow and you get ready for that next house amen and people uh people don't really keep their eyes on that next house the way that they should all right our new home but jesus did how many knows jesus was telling disciples look you know i go don't let your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me and i'm gonna go and i'm gonna prepare a place for you in other words i'm going somewhere else and i'm getting a place ready for you so get your eyes on that and every christian that was ever born every every uh abraham every paul anybody that was ever a christian their eyes were on that new place their new home their heavenly home amen and i'll tell you this right now i believe it's more relevant than any other time because not only was this coming towards the end of jesus life paul he began to speak about it brother branham talked about it and here we are at the end of the world and i believe it's time any time for us to leave this place i believe it's time to go real soon let's look at so jesus here was getting them to to look at it in the right perspective let's um turn if you will to saint john now st john the third chapter saint john 3 it says i'm sorry my bad first john not saint john first john and it talks about how that today is going to come that we are going to be and have the same body like jesus has amen first john 3 verse 1 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be let me ask how many knows we don't know exactly what it's going to be like but we know that when he shall appear we are going to be like him another place bible talks that we're going to have a body like unto his own glorious body am i right we're going to see him we're going listen we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is all right and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure now what are we looking at we're looking at somebody that is what we call uh like the song says some folks are building hopes down here planning ahead so busy with their fortune they forgot what jesus said he said but listen he says but there's a group of people but here's a group of people doing what getting ready to leave there's people that you have to coax you have to push you have to scare to death almost to try to get ready to leave this place but john says if this is the hope that you have he says every man that has this hope of seeing him and being just like him it says that he purified himself you ain't it's just like that dove with the oil on the inside hey man you ain't got to coax and push people amen that i have got the gold if you've got your eyes amen on christ if you've got it on the rapture if you got it on the coming of the lord you're going to put everything in perspective yourself you'll have your priorities the way that they're supposed to be otherwise you're going to have to be pushed and shoved and let me say this the second that people get their eyes off of this goal they let all kinds of things come in huh they get lukewarm they get reckless they get you know just all kinds of many times sin will come in because why they haven't got their focus the way it is supposed to be amen it's a desire how many knows it's a desire that you have i don't know about you but i hope that's what you have tonight is a desire to see the lord turn to another one in hebrews well if you will with me let's look at abraham for a minute i'll talk about seeking and desiring seeking and desiring a better country amen abraham chapter 11 of hebrews verse 8 by faith abraham when he was called out to go into a place where he should after he after received for an inheritance he obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went he didn't know just where he was going to go by faith he so adjourned in a strange land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise now he knows that abraham was at a home where he lived but when i called him to go out into another strain it was a strange country to him he didn't know just where to go god had to tell him where to go it was a strange place he went through some strange places are you with me this morning this is this is some strange this is a strange world we're living in some strange times with strange things everything is strange huh you go around and everybody's all tattooed up you're like that is so strange they got earrings and nose rings like they look almost like them africans do out there that don't know anything about god yeah boy i'll tell you what couldn't the prophet have been more right about saying when it's become so civilized and so modern he says the pinnacle swings backwards people go right back into hedonism they become complete evens that's exactly what it's done that's exactly where people are at becoming complete heathen not even believing in god in a very country that has in god we trust on every penny and diamond dollar that we got we get we got the most biggest bunch of heathens in the world but it swings back but it's a strange place that's for deca i mean that's how it was for abraham now notice he says the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which has foundations whose builder and maker is god i mean that was abraham he was looking for a city amen that how many of that cities found in the same chapter i read a while ago revelations uh 21 and i saw the holy city coming down out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband you know right he's looking for what kind of city abraham what did he have he had a desire for an eternal city every christian that's born in the spirit i believe desires that one thing and that is to have something that's eternal because we're living in a world where nothing is eternal seems like holy spirit is but everything around us all changes all passes away amen amen when you look at it just like the bicycle at the end if if you keep looking at the way you're supposed to that right everything in your life will stay in perspective but if you don't it'll get out of perspective amen so he looked he says for a city whose builder and maker was god and then we'll go down to verse 13. these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them i believe that's important how many please when you're looking for a city who's builder and makers god when you're looking for an eternal home or can we say a body that is eternal an eternal body an eternal home you have to be persuaded of it he is persuaded and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth how maybe that's what you and i are we're pilgrims and we're strangers here this place is getting weirder all the time strangers all the time i'm just passing through this place folks amen we're looking for a different kind of place let me just put this in when you get born again brother bam talks in the future home he says you know that this world is going to pass away peter saw it the heavens and the earth passed away with a great noise he said that he used to think perhaps that that means annihilated but that passed away don't mean annihilated it means changing from one form to another is that right and the same way with when somebody talks about well my my loved one passed away let's hope that's all they did right because they just changed from one form to another amen you go from one to another amen just like going from a physical body to a spiritual body amen and the world is going to do the same thing it's going to pass from one form to another it's going to change but now when we're born again how many knows that before christ can come and make his abode here amen god has to come down he's got to burn do some burning he's got to burn all the old stuff out and you brother ben says not only this this this old self of you it doesn't uh it don't just pass away it's got to die you can't just put it aside or divorce it it has to die your old nature has to die completely die for that new man to be born amen just like the world will let me just say this and i want you to think about the atmosphere that you and i were in with the first birth that we had our first nature that we had our first uh uh the first person that was inhabiting this body huh because that first person i i want him to be completely dead all right i want the new man where the bible says that we're a new creation all things have passed away all things have become new everything else is gone you're a new creature amen a new creation he says that's the way it's going to be with this world it's only the atmosphere around it and the sin that's upon the earth that will be destroyed he says we realize that the heavens means the atmospheres above what does it do these thistles and sickness and death and politics and sinful man and sinful woman and evil spirits will all be gone away and annihilated they'll burn with fervent heat the earth is the only thing that passes away that's the only thing that will be made new because we're going to live where for eternity right here right here praise the lord doesn't that make you feel good knowing i'm going to be right here i ain't going nowhere i'm going to go away but for a while but i'm going to come right back amen now notice sinful women evil spirits will all be gone in an hour late see it has to be done that way because we are going to live right here right here is where we're going to live the thistles the germs the sickness and things will be completely taken away all of this is in existence that's in the earth now man-made systems politics sin all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with how many knows that that's where we're living it we're living in a complete contaminated world amen just kind of like this virus now it's just to get all around us now how many knows it's all around us we're even catching it yeah thank god that it's not killing any of us huh we thank god for delivering us from it amen but it's yeah it is rampant we see it everywhere but it's just like a pest house brother bram says this whole place is like a pest house full of contaminants how many believes that when we get them over there there's not going to be any contamination over there no contamination on the other side no evil spirits my that's where we're going to god is making a place for our new bodies we're going to have a body like unto his own glorious body amen and there will be a world for us to live in now we're going all right now notice all this exists in the heavens or the atmospheres oh my and the earth which is now this earth holds these things but it wasn't made for that purpose sin caused it to be that way see and it was made by god the creator and all of our bodies that we live in right now were put on the earth that god created it excuse me because we're made out of the dust of the earth it was all laid out here when god created himself you were in here thinking you were in him the great eternal was a thought and attribute now sin caused all this to happen and god through this age is gathering up his material satan is still here that's the reason that all these things happen he's still here and all of his evil forces are still here that's why the earth now is so filthy that's why it is common the ridiculous thing that goes on bloodshed war politics sin adultery all kinds of filthiness goes on it's because the satan is the ruler of this earth and this atmosphere you say atmosphere that's right both the heavens and the earth is now contaminated with devils that can accuse us before god and but jesus is there to intercede for us let me stop there and go back here as we talk about here this uh as we think about the atmosphere let's talk about the atmosphere now christ came into our hearts changed us now right took out all the old rats and killed all the germs and the devils and the bad attitudes the fussing and the fighting and the cussing and the drinking and smoke all of that's all cleared out and where are you living out where is the inner man in it where's the inner man at on a wednesday night where are we sitting where we sit in heavenly places shouts praise the lord hallelujah glory to god there ain't no sin there there ain't no doubt there there ain't no frustration there there ain't no darkness there there ain't no sad and wozzy wildy who's there why christ has given us hope he's given us joys give us peace why don't we fit in this man on the inside this doesn't we don't we don't fit in here huh no they legalized smoking legalized then they're legionizing weed now am i right talking about wanting to legalize prostitution like anna and canada and them other places come on folks just complete debauchery we don't fit in here we want things that are pure things that are holy things that are lovely how many knows that brother brown said sure we're americans huh but our spirit isn't american it's not german it's not swiss it's not uh you know all these things we have a different spirit comes from another place amen and we're looking for something else let me let me let me finish this quote here i never finished uh that paul made in hebrews here so he says that we're strangers and we're pilgrims on the earth that's right now for they that say such things plainly declare that they seek a country i don't know about y'all but through all of this politics that we have went through here in the lately this went through my mind what could i go to a country that would be better huh it has i think maybe you know brother brown says up way up there in canada it's like heaven's gonna be like maybe i'll go to canada huh maybe i'll go up there until somebody mentioned mosquitoes i don't want to get half the feet fight all the mosquitoes up there huh it's not perfect is it but sure through all of this you know the bible says we're seeking a better country now you realize we realize that we can still say or the world says i guess or or people say that this is still the best country in the world and all that it is it's still the best country in the world that's why we a lot of us say that look if you want social islam go on over there to them communist country if you want that huh but think about it but as good as we have it as good as we still have should i say when you look at all the debauchery huh we realize it's not good enough for us huh we're going to stay here as long as we are in this flesh but we're looking for a better country we're a bunch of people that is looking for something better that's what it says the bible says they declare plainly that they seek a country verse 16 says but now they desire a better country i mean it's desiring a better country yeah i'm an american i love america you know glad for what god's given us but i'm desiring a better place amen a better country that is in heavenly a heavenly country folks just everybody that claims to be a christian get that into perspective look at that and make that your goal and everything else will fall into place everything else be all right if that's your goal that you're looking for a place that is a heavenly country or indwelleth righteousness amen all right that is in heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city amen how many at least he's gone to prepare that city it's in the building it's under construction right now don't ask me how god can intercede for all of our sins and take care of the whole world and still be off over the under building a big city but he can he's big enough to do all that man when i think about god and you know i don't even think try to figure him out because you can't do it amen and how deep god really is how much he knows what he can do all right that's right so he's not ashamed to be called their god because they're not satisfied there's too many people that's satisfied with this world too many people satisfied their sin too much people satisfied where they're at but i look for another country i'm looking for another place amen praise be to god all right so now what is our next body of course let's talk about our second home our second home is going to be our theophany our theophany body now it's it's over let's go to corinthians to find this i think it was the holy spirit that showed brother branham this paul we want to look at paul preaching basically a funeral service talking about the first man and the second man he talked about a celestial body in that right over in chapter first corinthians 15 and verse 40. we'll begin i want to read just that one and then we'll jump over to verse 47. so first corinthians 15 40. there are also celestial bodies amen we believe that that theophany is the celestial body amen and body's terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another verse 47 paul says it this way trying to explain where we're going what's going to happen the first man is of the earth earthly but the second man is of the lord from heaven how many believes that and as is the earthly such are they also that are earthly and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly amen as jesus this body is so our body will be and as we have borne the image of the earthly so shall we also bear the image of the heavenly now i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom effect of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption praise the lord behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen any moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed for this corruption shall must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on imma mortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory paul once again to the thessalonians says about the same thing and from scripture we were familiar with he says i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning those which are asleep that ye saw not even as others which have no hope but if you believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for their lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the work of voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain and shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen now there is a scripture that i missed huh okay so let me go back for just a second i don't know if i can even find it for a preacher i really should be able to do this but i'm not finding it all right over in corinthians maybe brother bad would know for if this earthly tabernacle of this house be dissolved we have one waiting it's in corinthians i should know where that is just right off the go get but i don't that's really one of the one of the ones i wanted to quote it's the beginning of a chapter this i'm relatively sure of speak of men and angels and so forth all right we'll leave that we'll just just repeat that for you okay how many members are familiar with the scripture he says for we which uh uh before this earthly tabernacle of this house be dissolved we have one already waiting in the heavens ii corinthians thank you second corinthians 5 and 1. there it is i'll tell you what when i switch bibles i can't just go to that certain neck you know and so that happens but we know chapter 5 second to corinthians for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens praise be to god how many knows we've had that explained to us by a prophet of god vindicated prophet of god exactly what that means so anybody that any denominational person amishman and i whoever most of the time when they don't understand that hardly at all but you and i understand it perfectly because brother branham he went over there didn't he he went over there and he seen the second house that we have which is the theophany house i believe that second home that we have is a theophany body when he was over there you know they were not eating or drinking they were just in a perfect body in a perfect place now brother brahm says after the rapture when the rapture comes they come back and they pick up a what glorified body what is that that is the actual if this goes to the ashes goes to the dust it doesn't matter where it is those atoms now it won't come up corrupt it comes up paul said incorrupt but he takes to redeem something is to bring back it's not to take something else if one falls down to redeem something is to bring the same thing back but abraham says resurrection and all that it's not to bring a different body up because there's people around a message some perhaps even don't think it'll be the same body it'll be it's a different body no it'll be the same adam's i don't care what it is god will bring that back brother brown clearly said he says i don't care where my atoms my burnt ashes bring me gotta call that thing back amen but it'll be in a glorified state it'll be you amen amen so that's our second body of course is the theophany body now he's at one place you know you are here this is where it's hard to comprehend for the world you are here what you are somewhere else i mean so you have a representation over there and he says you know that body is perfect there's not a flaw in that body whenever you're at 20 years old that's what you'll be amen an old lady over 80 years old that passed away come to hug brother ma'am say oh brother branham i'm so glad you came i'm so glad you preached because you came because you went because you preached we are here and he said you don't recognize her do you she was over 80 years 90 years old when you let her to the lord how about the old man that was out there and lived in the country amen and he was about 80 some years old and he was an infidel don't beli atheist didn't believe in god and that right didn't believe in god and everything else and brother branham ended up leading him to the lord through that woman neighbor of his that was healed of cancer completely he got to telling him hey that woman she was completely healed the preacher told her her sister or somebody take this handkerchief lay it upon her and she did and she was healed but everybody says the man was preaching to me he says you tell me what tells that tree sap to go down into the roots what intelligence tells us apple trees happen to go into the roots before winter comes and i'll tell you it's the same intelligence told me what was wrong with that woman and was just going to be amen how many believers will see them but they'll be in their perfect youth form again amen now there is things that i don't understand amen things that i don't understand and that is if we come back with the theo if they come back with the theophany to pick up a glorified body what happens with the theophany body can't answer that i don't know i don't know if it goes within the glorified body i don't know all i know is one place jesus said don't touch me i haven't been glorified yet and that right but in another place he came back and he could go through walls not right he could walk right through walls and he says give me fish to eat he ate fish and bread he could eat and drink he could do all of that and still go through walls so i don't understand it but god knows what he's doing isn't that right it's in his hands and right now they're over there and they don't eat and drink but they'll come back and brother bam says when we come back we pick up those glorified bodies so that we can eat and drink and to live through a thousand year millennial i'm just looking forward to that i don't know about you but i'm looking for it it's my whole goal is my whole ambition is for that home that's bright and fair be no more death no more old age no more passing away and for me that takes care of all the rest i'll have my life right i'll make myself make sure i'm ready to go if you've got that hope the bible says you're going to see to it that you're ready amen oh my time does go fast all right end with a quote if that's all right now brother branham is preaching on god's only provided place of worship he says and as i see all of us the three of us getting creeping up towards that age i guess he was talking about a couple of friends he is getting older well we could say the same thing all right towards that age the end it would be very sad thing if we didn't have place within us that great thing what we know is true we're fixing to turn back one of these days back to our young manhood again our bodies will be transformed made into his likeness to stand forever for when this earthly tabernacle of our habitation is dissolved there's one already waiting and the thankful part of it dear friend that the lord jesus you trust me to tell you the truth the dear lord jesus one morning about eight o'clock let me see that land it wasn't the vision but i don't want to say that ever what it was it was just as real as i'm speaking to you here now i've seen the faces of those people and i couldn't recognize them they had turned back young again and it was just as real i'd hold their hands and things just as real and it helped me because i used to have the idea that a person when a person died just their soul went off but then he quoted that to me that if this earthly tabernacle of our habitation we already have one see and we've got to have that everything and we've got that to have everything in there than the threes to make perfection there's the one body here and there's the body the celestial body and then there's the glorified body in the resurrection see and it makes it complete it's not a myth not just an idea or a spirit and then years ago i seen the regions of the lost and i was there and i tell you friend as an old man let me persuade you this across this nation this morning don't you never you never want to view that place there's no way at all that i could if i was an artist with a brush and could i couldn't paint the picture as a minister i couldn't describe it to you talk about a hell being a burning place it's a million times worse than that the horrors that go with it in heaven or this place whatever it was i don't know what to call it he referred it to me as the souls that are under the altar and when it was i have never there's no way to explain how great it is now you just have to take my word i'm just a man see but these visions that's always come to pass just as i've told you and you know that every one of them has been true and this is true also whatever you do if you miss everything else health strength eyesight whatever it is whatever you miss don't miss that there's nothing to compare with it there's no words in the english language that could express it if you'd say perfect it's beyond that superb it's beyond that sublime there's no words that could ever express it and then to think that isn't the end of it yet i thought me be afraid to come to this i said do you eat said not here we don't eat here but when we go back down to earth we'll receive a body that we can eat in amen when he comes back we which are alive and remain shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye just change from this dimension into another one amen and we're gonna go and live for a thousand years how many knows the first thing happens is we get picked up and we go to the marriage supper for three and a half years we're sitting around a table i don't know he said thousands of miles long reach across the table say how you doing brother praise the lord we made it we're here glory i don't know i don't know if we're gonna have table manners or not i don't know if we're just gonna shout and shy praise god but we're gonna rejoice for about three and a half years while things are going down here that couldn't be fathomed while the earth is burning the elements shall melt with fervent heat all the sinners nail the sin and everything else is being burned but let me tell you week after week service after service tape after tape bible after bible god is burning out all the sin out of your life all the sin out of my life everything that's wrong everything that's evil god if the holy spirit is burning it out all right getting us ready for that place over there either get it burnt out now or you'll get burnt by it it'll burn you later one way or the other it has to get annihilated amen we go up there for a while we don't know what kind of volcanoes we don't know how god's going to change us but i'm here to tell you when we come back to the millennium something's going to have to be different because i just don't want to live in nashville i don't want to live in clarksville i don't want to live in elkton do you i can't believe god's going to leave things the same and we're going to come down here and live in this no it's going to be a paradise amen we'll come out the bible says we'll come and walk out on the ashes of the wicked and god will speak out of paradise for us like you wouldn't believe and then isaiah 65. it talks about how that will build in houses and will inhabit it another man isn't going to come and take your house from you amen how many knows but i'm seeing the house where hopeless says nobody's going to take this out from you perhaps the house of what he was going to build amen and on and on and on i don't know about you but my heavenly home is bright and fair i feel like traveling on let others seek a home below amen amen not but i feel like traveling on amen god bless you if you will stand with me tonight with our heads bowed how many in here would just say brother byler sometimes i just i get my perspective strong my my ambitions wrong and i lose vision like i should of where i want to be in that i'm really seeking a better country in sometimes i don't act like i do sometimes i don't do like i do and i don't let the holy spirit convict me of my wrong like i do you just want to raise your hand say god i want to keep my goal i want to set my mind on the goal that sweet home of the soul keep my perspective right lord help me to keep my eye on the end father on that brand new home that you've got for me that eternal place not just temporary place lord jesus you see the hands that are all over the building father and mind goes up because it's so easy to get caught up with the things of the world until you get lacks in your spirit realm hard and i ask god that you'll forgive us each and every one lord jesus we're relaxed lord and where we've gotten too soft perhaps and and and swayed too much by the things of this world and we've kept our eyes too much on the world that we're living in now not realizing that we're just pilgrims and strangers here father and i ask god that you help us lord just to be ready even as you said many times to yourself be ready for you know not the day or the hour be ready for it'll come as a thief in the night oh god help us lord jesus to be ready for that time lord jesus when you call and when you summons when we hear that holy spirit calling father and i feel it in my heart that we're so close close so close god that just at any time you could call that little virgin bride away that you could call those that have prayed up that are ready that are just waiting for you to come lord and you'll just come and they'll just slip out of here lord jesus in the world say well they just come up missing we don't know what happened to him but lord we want to be part of that number that comes up missing lord jesus we have our hands up and say god whatever you do lord jesus we don't want to miss it lord in the bible you talk about how that the rich man how did he wanted to go back and tell his brothers go tell them to be ready don't come into this terrible place lord jesus we have that we have a prophet of god that lord told us whatever you do don't miss that and don't go to downward road and we've had all of that lord jesus how foolish we would be not to heed it but lord we're here raising our hands saying god we want to heed we want to be ready for that hour that lays ahead father for that great time when we're gonna go to a place that when we've been there ten thousand years we'll have no less days to sing god's praise than when we first begun that is our goal we are seeking a city we are seeking a country that is better father we prepare ourselves for that country in the name of jesus christ right now every heart preparing themselves saying forgive me lord jesus of all my sins and failure wash me white in the blood of the lamb and keep my eyes on you lord in jesus name amen and amen god bless you church
