[33:26] seems dark in here but
[33:27] i think all the lights are on so it must
[33:30] just be me
[33:31] amen probably because it's dark outside
[33:34] we're not used to that maybe that's what
[33:36] it is
[33:37] amen praise the lord i hope you all
[33:39] enjoy the
[33:40] wonderful fall weather that's what i've

[34:00] approach your throne lord jesus
[34:02] desiring god that lord as we speak to
[34:05] your people father this evening lord and
[34:06] as they approach the throne of grace
[34:09] throne of god father and to bring
[34:11] themselves and to present themselves
[34:12] before you we ask god that
[34:14] you would just look at every heart look
[34:16] at the motive and
[34:17] the objective every heart and life
[34:19] tonight lord and we just desire god
[34:21] you'll
[34:22] minister lord to our needs speak to us
[34:24] the thing that we have need of
[34:26] and lord we just ask god that you've
[34:28] helped me to step out of the way that
[34:30] you'd use your gift lord jesus
[34:32] and father that you would lord be a
[34:34] blessing in the
[34:35] edification of the body of christ thank
[34:38] you for all that you do we praise you
[34:40] we love you for all that you do father
[34:41] and what you mean to us
[34:43] it is such an honor and such a
[34:44] privileged lord to be able to get away
[34:46] on a midweek service
[34:48] lord and not to have to stream but lord
[34:50] we just to be able to assemble ourselves
[34:51] together
[34:52] and to worship you in spirit any truth
[34:54] father we just ask god tonight the
[34:57] thought that i feel you've laid upon my
[34:58] heart to speak on that you would just
[35:00] have the preeminence and say what you
[35:03] once said father
[35:04] in jesus name we ask it amen and amen
[35:09] amen turn your bibles if you will
[35:12] and we'll go
[35:17] to matthew the fourth chapter i believe
[35:21] we'll begin
[35:23] and i just want to take tonight
[35:29] the little phrase that brother branham
[35:31] made and i think i may have preached on
[35:33] this not so often long ago
[35:35] uh the phrase that he made and when he
[35:38] made this statement the statement that
[35:40] he made actually about
[35:41] his chain being its strongest
[35:45] at its weakest link so tonight we're
[35:48] going to call it the chain
[35:50] just the chain amen and so
[35:53] but i actually want to speak about
[35:56] several different chains if we have
[35:58] time amen but we want to talk about the
[36:01] chain
[36:03] matthew 4
[36:07] verse 1 then was jesus led up of the
[36:10] spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
[36:12] of the devil
[36:14] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[36:16] nights he was afterwards a hunger
[36:19] and when the tempter came to him he said
[36:21] if thou be the son of god
[36:23] command these stones to be made bread
[36:26] but jesus answered and said it is
[36:29] written
[36:29] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[36:32] every word that proceedeth out of the
[36:33] mouth of god
[36:35] may god add his blessings to reading
[36:37] words you can be seated
[36:41] amen so this evening i want to start
[36:45] with talking about the chain
[36:48] of the word amen the chain of the word
[36:52] amen god's word is like a chain
[36:55] amen and so i'm going to read a
[37:00] met a quote out of the
[37:03] message called harvest time it says now
[37:06] let's now go back in genesis which
[37:08] is genesis means the beginning we find
[37:11] that god gave his
[37:13] each family eternal life
[37:16] as long as they stayed in the word and
[37:18] lived by this word
[37:20] amen so now i read that in
[37:23] in matthew because that's going to be
[37:25] our middle of the book where jesus
[37:28] talked about it in the middle of the
[37:29] book talking about the word of god
[37:31] amen but now we want to go to genesis
[37:33] for just a minute we won't go to the
[37:34] actual scripture but we know that god
[37:36] had commanded them
[37:38] that thou shalt not eat of this tree
[37:41] neither shall you touch it at least ye
[37:44] die isn't that right
[37:46] that was the word amen and satan comes
[37:48] along and he says thou
[37:50] shalt not surely die so brother man says
[37:52] look as long as they live by this word
[37:55] but they broke it so he says
[37:59] and just one link in the chain
[38:02] of promises death struck them
[38:06] which was a promise also he says it's a
[38:09] chain
[38:10] all right it's a chain god's word is a
[38:12] chain
[38:14] and um he says and you're
[38:18] you're hanging over hell with it
[38:24] all right now let me stop there i'm
[38:27] going to take my time tonight is that
[38:29] okay
[38:30] and i want to go down before i read the
[38:32] rest of this
[38:34] and kind of give you a description and i
[38:36] would like to almost change this
[38:38] description a little bit but
[38:40] um i'm going to read it the way brother
[38:42] bam said it first
[38:44] now this is very strong but just listen
[38:48] close
[38:51] no that's not the one he says listen
[38:54] that's
[38:55] like taking a man and you're hanging by
[38:58] his
[38:58] feet and he's got his hands
[39:03] in heaven i don't just understand that
[39:07] quite right but
[39:08] and you cut him half in two or break off
[39:11] a toe whatever you're hanging on to
[39:13] you're hanging on the very bottom of it
[39:15] bottom part
[39:16] and you break that chain anywhere you're
[39:18] gone see
[39:19] now bear that mind so as brother bam
[39:22] talks about hanging on a chain we can
[39:24] imagine and
[39:25] and probably in the old days we've seen
[39:27] movies of people that were
[39:29] perhaps hanging by a rope and that right
[39:31] that rope was perhaps
[39:32] brittle and it'd be begin to fray i'll
[39:35] remember it would fray and and man it
[39:37] was
[39:38] a high anticipation of the person
[39:40] definitely going to fall over the cliff
[39:41] because this
[39:42] rope's frayed you know it's got a weak
[39:44] spot in it it's cutting on the edge of
[39:46] the rocks or something you know
[39:48] that's kind of what i imagine you know
[39:50] and it's like uh
[39:52] you know it'd be like hanging on a chain
[39:55] perhaps you got a hold of a hook or
[39:57] something on the bottom of that chain
[39:58] now
[39:59] you know and brother i'm talking about
[40:01] be cutting two or if you break it
[40:03] anywhere is what he's trying to say
[40:05] if you break that anywhere he's gone you
[40:07] know
[40:08] and so if you cut the toes or whatever
[40:10] but in this case if you had a hold of a
[40:12] hook
[40:12] perhaps you can't even get this other
[40:14] hand up and you're hanging there by
[40:16] just four fingers you know and those
[40:19] fingers are eventually going to cut off
[40:20] but lord help me if there's someone is
[40:23] something swinging through the air
[40:25] and it hits those four fingers and
[40:27] smashes your four fingers
[40:29] how many knows you'd probably be gone
[40:31] right
[40:32] because your whole body is hanging on by
[40:35] your four fingers it's just by hanging
[40:37] on with that
[40:38] so bab describes this
[40:42] he dramatizes this as being hanging
[40:45] over hell your soul is hanging over
[40:51] the burning blazes right i mean fire
[40:54] a pit of fire over hell
[40:58] and so your whole soul is hanging on the
[41:02] chain and you're hanging there
[41:04] amen and you wouldn't want a weak link
[41:07] in that chain
[41:07] you want that chain to be strong
[41:10] but if that chain you know they could
[41:13] have big old round
[41:14] hooks like that or round circles really
[41:16] big chain
[41:17] it could pull a bulldozer but if one of
[41:20] those was made out of something perhaps
[41:22] just the two chains wired together a
[41:24] little bit you would not be concerned
[41:26] about any part except for that
[41:29] wire together place
[41:32] right you'd be very concerned about this
[41:34] wired together place where
[41:35] the weak spot that's what we're going to
[41:37] talk about that weak spot
[41:38] that weak link in the chain
[41:42] amen and i just want to say this that
[41:45] that
[41:45] is satan's territory
[41:49] of triumph satan's territory of
[41:53] triumph amen in people's lives all
[41:56] down through history has been
[42:00] their weak spot amen
[42:03] their weak part in their life amen
[42:07] and here with the word of god let me
[42:09] finish this if i may
[42:10] amen this coats irritating my neck with
[42:12] this i may have to go back to
[42:14] the old lapel down here i don't know
[42:18] but anyway so now notice so now i notice
[42:20] he says
[42:22] now you're hanging over hell with it he
[42:24] says and that's the only thing
[42:26] that will carry you through
[42:29] all right is every word of god
[42:33] every word how many knows that
[42:36] there was a great fall because one word
[42:38] was broke
[42:40] there was a weak link in that right now
[42:44] will you and i know that that weak link
[42:47] was
[42:47] eve god created a weak link he knew she
[42:51] would fall you know right
[42:52] he created it that way but still put him
[42:54] on fremont basis free moral agency to
[42:57] choose which way you want to go
[42:59] but now notice so he says now when the
[43:01] believer becomes a make-believer and
[43:03] lives in
[43:05] on one word that's contrary
[43:09] to this he cuts his fellowship with god
[43:15] i mean blaze that in in the old
[43:18] testament to break
[43:19] one the least commandment you've broke
[43:21] them all
[43:22] you're guilty of one and you're guilty
[43:24] of them all amen so it's just that one
[43:27] place
[43:27] he says and you cut your fellowship off
[43:30] with god
[43:31] it meant by taking one word that's
[43:34] contrary to the word of god
[43:38] and i like it down here he says it's
[43:40] very strong but listen close
[43:42] he says one word one word of god was
[43:44] first in the bible
[43:46] god said one word separated man
[43:49] from its eternal life chain
[43:52] amen he talked about a loop eternal life
[43:56] chain he was linked together
[43:58] amen but it broke that you know right we
[44:00] came down into time and one day god will
[44:03] bring it back together
[44:04] but it broke that broke his eternal life
[44:06] broke the whole chain
[44:08] plunged the whole human race into death
[44:11] because one word was broken
[44:14] because of that one place eve just
[44:17] disbelieved
[44:18] one word she actually
[44:21] believed a word she wasn't supposed to
[44:23] believe
[44:25] all right it wasn't that she didn't
[44:26] believe any you know any of she believed
[44:29] that god said
[44:30] thou shalt surely perish she believed
[44:32] that
[44:33] but then satan comes in there and then
[44:35] he adds a word
[44:36] and she believed the extra word thou
[44:39] shalt not surely perish she believed to
[44:41] not
[44:42] and it brings it all into this chaos
[44:44] that we're in
[44:45] so because the one word is why we get
[44:48] gray hair we get old
[44:50] we die one word broken and now notice
[44:53] here in the middle of the bible
[44:55] jesus comes along and he says and he's
[44:57] 40 days hungered
[44:58] starving to death all right because
[45:01] you know during the time that he was uh
[45:03] you know he talks about i believe it was
[45:05] afterwards he was hungered
[45:09] all right yeah it does say verse two it
[45:11] says and afterwards
[45:13] he was a hunger in other words he wasn't
[45:14] hungry until then but
[45:16] afterwards he got really really hungry
[45:19] and then satan tempted him to make uh
[45:22] stones into bread amen just
[45:27] the same temptation that he brought to
[45:30] eve he brought to
[45:32] jesus and that is to obey him
[45:36] to believe him to become servant to him
[45:39] but what did jesus turn around and say
[45:42] he said
[45:42] that man shall not live by bread alone
[45:46] but man shall live by every word that
[45:49] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[45:52] amen and it's pretty strong because i
[45:56] believe you and i are living in that
[45:57] hour
[45:58] that the bride of christ is going to
[46:01] believe
[46:01] every word he says he's got to believe
[46:04] every word in order to take us back to
[46:05] eden again
[46:07] now there was at times i mean there was
[46:09] a time when martin luther john wesley
[46:11] and
[46:11] amish and mennonite and everybody else
[46:13] so they were ignorant of what the truth
[46:16] really was
[46:17] god winked at people's ignorance but not
[46:20] here in the end time not after he came
[46:23] and proved it over and over
[46:25] what was the truth ignorance is no
[46:27] excuse anymore now your soul
[46:29] hangs over hell of whether or not you
[46:31] believe every word of god
[46:35] amen and let me just put it as strong
[46:38] and straight as he did
[46:41] cuts off his fellowship with god
[46:42] remember your faith in this word is like
[46:45] a chain
[46:46] and it change is strongest at its
[46:49] weakest link
[46:50] that's right it's the strongest right
[46:52] there
[46:54] because that's all it'll hold
[46:57] amen and if there's something in the
[46:58] word that's puzzling you
[47:00] something that you heard different but
[47:03] they said
[47:03] oh the days of apostles them things are
[47:05] all gone by when
[47:07] the scripture says that jesus christ
[47:10] is the same yesterday today and forever
[47:12] don't let that be a weakness
[47:14] fortify it and hold it amen
[47:18] how many believe justifications believe
[47:19] one word misplaced one word
[47:22] is eternal death it's very serious
[47:27] and wrap your life into it because
[47:28] that's the only thing that'll take you
[47:30] over the flames of hell that's right
[47:34] amen pray the lord
[47:38] so now notice let me finish this here so
[47:41] and when this chain
[47:42] is broke with adam and eve the first
[47:44] family now remember
[47:46] they didn't break a sentence they didn't
[47:48] break three words
[47:49] only one word man shall hell man shall
[47:53] hang over hell
[47:55] by every word every word that proceedeth
[47:57] out of the mouth of god
[47:59] that's where man's eternal destination
[48:01] is determined
[48:02] why he'll hang by that chain
[48:06] or he'll hang by a creed and if there's
[48:08] any creed mixed
[48:09] into that chain that's where the weak
[48:11] lick is amen
[48:13] and you're gone
[48:16] now notice if you'll notice that brother
[48:18] abandonment towers the end of his
[48:19] ministry
[48:21] 1964-1965 this is where he preached like
[48:24] this
[48:24] this is where he got very straight with
[48:27] any creed
[48:28] any dogma amen when he preached the god
[48:31] chosen place of worship there's
[48:33] no other place god will meet you only in
[48:35] christ will he meet you
[48:36] amen he got really straight no creed can
[48:38] be mixed anymore
[48:40] come out of there come out of there and
[48:42] you know be about not particularly
[48:44] since all right so now notice
[48:47] he says again now he says the day that
[48:50] you put
[48:51] into you anything besides the
[48:54] unadulterated word of god
[48:56] into your soul that's the day you're
[48:59] separated from god amen
[49:02] praise the lord so we see that the word
[49:04] of god how many knows the word of god
[49:07] is a chain and only our faith in that
[49:10] word
[49:11] amen amen and the way that we follow
[49:13] that word and the way that we live by
[49:15] that word
[49:16] and i tell you what i was thinking about
[49:18] how much of
[49:19] of different things that the holy
[49:21] spirit's been telling us of how that we
[49:23] ought to feed even sunday did you notice
[49:25] our brother how he said that you know
[49:26] the holy spirit is saying that you know
[49:28] we really amen we've got to
[49:30] labor we've got the hunger we've got to
[49:32] study we got to read we got to meditate
[49:34] on these things more
[49:36] how many believe that that's what the
[49:37] spirit's been telling us that we have to
[49:39] focus more on it
[49:40] amen and think about it more amen
[49:43] there's
[49:44] amen peace there's joy in it and
[49:47] that's where you get your joy is in your
[49:49] prayer life and
[49:50] and your time with the lord and feeding
[49:52] on the word of god
[49:54] all right so another so i wanted to
[49:57] cover that let's see i want to have
[49:58] i want to cover about four different
[50:00] subjects tonight one of them of course
[50:02] the word is to talk about the chain of
[50:04] the word
[50:04] amen and the other one is the chain of
[50:07] your character
[50:08] all right the chain of your character
[50:11] the chain of the church
[50:13] all right and just the difference
[50:15] several different chains
[50:16] that brother bam talked about now the
[50:19] second one i want to go to is over in
[50:22] ii peter let's go to second peter
[50:27] and this is another place that it's
[50:29] mentioned about
[50:30] us chain being its strongest at its
[50:32] weakest link
[50:37] and brother branham is preaching on the
[50:38] stature of a perfect man
[50:41] all right statue of a perfect man so
[50:43] we'll try to go through this
[50:44] all right second chapter second
[50:47] book of peter chapter one verse
[50:51] five and besides this giving all
[50:53] diligence add to your faith
[50:55] virtue and to virtue knowledge and to
[50:58] knowledge
[50:58] temperance and to temperance patience
[51:01] and to patience godliness
[51:03] and to brotherly unto godliness
[51:05] brotherly kindness
[51:07] and brotherly kindness charity now
[51:09] notice and if these things be in you and
[51:12] about they make you that you shall
[51:13] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[51:15] knowledge of the lord jesus christ
[51:17] but he that lacketh thee things and i
[51:19] want to dwell on that for just a second
[51:21] or two maybe
[51:22] but he that lack of these things is
[51:24] blind and cannot see a far
[51:26] off and has forgotten that he is purged
[51:28] from his old sense
[51:31] there's another one over in in first
[51:34] corinthians i want to go to because this
[51:36] will go along with this
[51:38] amen because this brother bannon went
[51:39] down and teaching the statue of a
[51:41] perfect mind i think you all know where
[51:42] i'm going
[51:44] because you have probably have listened
[51:45] to this message quite a few times
[51:49] but i want to i want to pick it over to
[51:50] paul because paul
[51:52] actually bears this out about their
[51:55] uh about that weak link even in a
[51:57] person's character
[51:59] all right because this is what i call a
[52:00] person's character
[52:02] it's called the statue of a perfect man
[52:04] right
[52:05] and it's uh let me just go over here the
[52:08] statue of a perfect man
[52:10] uh it also has to do with the ages each
[52:12] one representing it
[52:13] we know that the first one is faith the
[52:16] second one is virtued in knowledge and
[52:18] temperance and patience and godliness
[52:20] and brotherly kindness
[52:21] and the holy ghost and perfect love amen
[52:25] of course the first one brother bam
[52:26] talked about was faith you know faith
[52:27] and so forth
[52:28] having virtue knowledge temperance and
[52:30] having all these things but he mentions
[52:32] it and he talks about you know if
[52:34] anywhere in these amen that you have a
[52:37] weak place
[52:38] amen and let's just say that amen you
[52:41] have you have a lot of these
[52:42] characteristics you've got faith
[52:44] you've got knowledge you've got virtue
[52:46] amen
[52:47] but let me just read it and and i'll
[52:49] talk to you about let me
[52:51] let me let paul explain it 13th chapter
[52:54] of
[52:54] corinthians paul said you know even
[52:57] though
[52:58] if i speak with tongues of men and
[53:00] angels
[53:01] if i lack something you know right in
[53:04] other words if there's something not
[53:06] there that's supposed to be there
[53:08] right so you can have tongues but if you
[53:12] don't have charity
[53:13] he meant you're already going to go down
[53:16] it's not going to work
[53:18] i have become a sounding brass and a
[53:20] tinkling symbol and do i have the gift
[53:22] of prophecy and i understand
[53:24] all mysteries and all knowledge and
[53:26] don't have all faith so that i could
[53:28] remove mountains if i don't have charity
[53:30] i
[53:31] am nothing so i believe paul's saying
[53:34] about what the prophet of god said that
[53:36] if you've got a weak place in there
[53:38] that's where the chain breaks
[53:42] amen that's where your character
[53:46] is mar and if you'll notice peter says
[53:49] that if these things be in you and about
[53:51] they'll make two that you are neither
[53:53] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[53:55] of the lord jesus christ
[53:58] brother bam says oh my let me see um
[54:01] i can just uh right here brother babe
[54:04] says
[54:05] what is it if if all these things really
[54:08] are in you and about he says this is
[54:10] really what
[54:11] what you are he says what is it
[54:14] then full of love and full of the holy
[54:16] ghost walking around what is it it's a
[54:19] stature that uh
[54:20] that unbelievers can look at and say now
[54:23] there is a christian
[54:25] there is a man or a woman who knows what
[54:27] they're talking about you've never seen
[54:29] a kindly or
[54:30] sweeter godlier person
[54:33] brother baby says when you have these
[54:35] things you become the perfect tabernacle
[54:38] of god to dwell in and to live in
[54:41] how many wants that but
[54:44] as i said i wanted to dwell on second
[54:46] peter the others
[54:48] he that lacketh thee things he that
[54:50] lacketh he thinks in other words
[54:52] he when you say that you're a christian
[54:53] and you lack these things
[54:55] it's like you're saying that i am a
[54:57] christian i'm
[54:58] i'm just going to take for illustration
[55:00] you're going to say that you call
[55:02] yourself a cow
[55:03] i'm a cow all right
[55:06] but listen when you open your mouth a
[55:09] moo doesn't come out
[55:10] a s the winning of a horse
[55:14] you know right if you had a different
[55:16] sound coming out you'd say look
[55:18] he calls himself a cow but he sounds
[55:21] like a horse
[55:23] all right and his ears are straight up
[55:25] in the air and this cow's
[55:27] ears are drooping all right he don't
[55:29] look like a cow
[55:30] he don't sound like a cow you know you
[55:33] don't act like a cow you don't have a
[55:35] other like a cow you don't
[55:36] just don't look like a cow and that's
[55:39] what it's like for a person that likes
[55:41] the
[55:41] thing if you lack neat things amen it
[55:44] shows that there's something wrong there
[55:47] but notice so we talk about character
[55:49] and that's our character whenever we
[55:51] have
[55:52] faith you might have faith to move
[55:53] mountains
[55:55] but i sure hate that person over there
[55:58] huh oh i believe god i believe that oh
[56:02] hallelujah but there's another area
[56:04] that's just not right
[56:06] huh what it brings what we would call
[56:10] a um
[56:14] brother talked about a stick that's come
[56:16] on a corn stalk and it's deformed it
[56:19] right a deformed stalk and that's what
[56:21] we become
[56:22] if we lack these things in our weak like
[56:24] we weakness
[56:26] that's what we've become and i'm going
[56:28] to stop there for just a minute because
[56:29] it comes to my mind i think about david
[56:32] how many knows david was a man after
[56:34] god's own heart
[56:36] the bible says he was a man after god's
[56:37] own heart in other words i
[56:39] i from what i understand god liked david
[56:41] a whole lot
[56:42] god really liked david he was he was the
[56:45] guy
[56:46] but guess what david had a weakness
[56:50] he had a weak place and because of that
[56:54] weak place
[56:55] he brought reproach upon the whole
[56:57] nation
[57:00] not to mention amen his weakness
[57:03] brought amen it brought sin in and it
[57:06] brought
[57:06] chaos in amen it brought all
[57:10] kinds of destruction in him and you know
[57:13] saw
[57:13] absalom trying to take over the kingdom
[57:15] and that the kingdom divided and
[57:17] not eating his wives being ravished by
[57:19] everybody and everything it was
[57:21] terrible all because of that one weak
[57:24] place
[57:25] and how many knows it's those times like
[57:27] i said
[57:28] that place of weakness is where the
[57:30] devil's place of triumph is
[57:32] that he was shouting the praises oh the
[57:35] devil was having him a good time oh yeah
[57:38] yeah after god's own heart right you
[57:42] know
[57:43] yeah the devil was triumphant you know
[57:47] he was he was
[57:48] man he was just having a he loves those
[57:50] places the devil loves your weak places
[57:52] he knows where your weak
[57:54] places are amen how many
[57:57] is just a fervent prayer to god and a
[58:00] complete dedication to god
[58:02] and the strengthening of that weak lick
[58:04] is the only thing that will strengthen
[58:06] it and make it stronger
[58:08] because if that breaks no matter how
[58:10] much faith you got
[58:12] no matter how much you can preach or
[58:14] whatever it might be when that weak link
[58:16] comes it just brings a reproach on the
[58:17] whole thing
[58:19] amen and that's the way it was with
[58:21] david he had a weak spot
[58:22] and how about moses you know moses was a
[58:24] great man he went down in the face of
[58:26] pharaoh
[58:27] he was a mightier of god but he had a
[58:29] problem he still had a weak place in his
[58:31] life
[58:32] and it was called his amen temper
[58:35] finally whenever god you know and moses
[58:39] different times had a lot of patience
[58:40] but
[58:41] he also had this temper and one time you
[58:43] know when they uh
[58:44] they irritated moses for the last time
[58:46] and he got plum mad and he said must
[58:49] i fetch you water out of this rock and
[58:52] he smote the rock
[58:53] and he smote it again when it didn't
[58:55] come and god said
[58:57] had said speak to the rock
[59:00] and then right yeah it said speak to the
[59:02] wrong and it'll bring forth water and he
[59:03] smoked the rock twice
[59:04] break the whole pattern of god's word
[59:06] brother ham says
[59:08] and because of his temper he didn't go
[59:10] into the promised land
[59:12] he was saved and all but listen he had a
[59:13] weakness and that was where the devil
[59:15] prevailed that's where the devil
[59:17] triumphed
[59:18] is in that weak place and that's where
[59:21] the devil
[59:22] has his fun with you and me
[59:26] that's where he tries that's his victory
[59:30] for us to have weak places in our life
[59:32] huh
[59:34] and when we give into that weakness
[59:36] satan triumphs and he has his
[59:38] jubilee amen
[59:42] you know you think about how glorious
[59:44] david was but yet the shame that he
[59:47] wrought before because of his weakness
[59:49] same way with moses the man that he was
[59:51] the stature of god and speak like god
[59:53] and spoke for god
[59:54] and yet because of that god wouldn't let
[59:56] him go in because of that issue that he
[59:58] had and what about samson how many days
[1:00:01] do you
[1:00:01] think about samson how the mighty
[1:00:03] warrior he was
[1:00:04] i mean out there i don't like the might
[1:00:06] like to see the movie sometime
[1:00:08] of samson you know how he killed those
[1:00:10] thousand philistines and
[1:00:12] man just bashed their heads in and just
[1:00:14] swell
[1:00:15] heap upon heap heap upon heap he slew
[1:00:18] him
[1:00:20] huh he'd get a big old pile of them and
[1:00:23] he'd trip
[1:00:24] trip over and fall down he's getting
[1:00:25] started another pile start another foul
[1:00:27] and start another part just keep
[1:00:29] slaughtering just unbelievable
[1:00:33] superman but this superman was brought
[1:00:37] down because he had a weak place
[1:00:40] he had a weakness for delilah isn't that
[1:00:42] right
[1:00:43] amen and because of his weakness he
[1:00:45] ended up grinding at the mill had both
[1:00:47] of his eyes taken out
[1:00:49] and he was grinding at the mill and
[1:00:50] going around and around
[1:00:52] around the devil's slave
[1:00:55] because of his weakness god help us
[1:00:58] tonight
[1:01:00] amen
[1:01:03] how many believes that we don't want
[1:01:05] those weak places we do we want
[1:01:07] we want to have that chain strong
[1:01:10] all the way through amen
[1:01:15] praise the lord
[1:01:18] so brother bam says listen he says
[1:01:21] that's right if you possess
[1:01:22] one of these and you can say well i got
[1:01:24] this and i got that
[1:01:26] i have this but he says looky here
[1:01:30] you miss one place and that's where she
[1:01:32] breaks
[1:01:33] amen that place where you haven't got
[1:01:36] what you're supposed to have
[1:01:38] that's where it breaks
[1:01:42] and all of your strength and all of your
[1:01:45] greatness
[1:01:46] is only as strong and as good
[1:01:50] as the weakest place that you have
[1:01:57] wow that's as a way of deflating you a
[1:01:59] little bit don't it
[1:02:02] doesn't mean anything the only thing
[1:02:05] that means
[1:02:06] anything is how strong are you really
[1:02:09] amen praise the lord
[1:02:15] all right
[1:02:20] talk about the chain of the church
[1:02:25] the church body how many knows that
[1:02:29] over in uh first corinthians not 13 but
[1:02:33] we're going to go
[1:02:34] to the 12th chapter
[1:02:38] and you could read a lot here but
[1:02:41] i'll just read a couple of them it's
[1:02:42] okay i think everybody knows that
[1:02:47] pretty much the story but 12th chapter
[1:02:49] 12
[1:02:50] verse for as the body is one and have
[1:02:53] many members
[1:02:54] and all the members of that one body
[1:02:56] being many are one body
[1:02:58] so also is christ how many knows just as
[1:03:02] a
[1:03:02] physical body
[1:03:06] that's what he's talking about for by
[1:03:08] one spirit are we all baptized into one
[1:03:10] body whether we be jews or gentiles
[1:03:12] whether it be we've found they're free
[1:03:14] and have been
[1:03:14] all made to drink into one spirit
[1:03:18] amen and you know it talks about the
[1:03:22] food shall say this side or the other
[1:03:23] but let's just say that in this body
[1:03:27] perhaps your kidney doesn't work right
[1:03:31] huh or whatever it might be
[1:03:36] in verse 26 says if there's one member
[1:03:39] of that body that suffers
[1:03:41] all the members suffer with it
[1:03:44] or one member be honored all members
[1:03:47] rejoice with it huh
[1:03:51] and i remember you know brother ivan and
[1:03:53] where they said it was located the
[1:03:55] cancer was located
[1:03:57] now i forget the the different organs
[1:03:59] but it was between his uh
[1:04:01] uh liver i think in the next place that
[1:04:03] it's supposed to go to right in there
[1:04:04] and they they said it was inoperable
[1:04:06] they can't operate you know because of
[1:04:07] where it was
[1:04:09] and i thought you know most of the times
[1:04:11] a lot of times whether it's a perhaps a
[1:04:13] lung or perhaps it's a
[1:04:15] it's one of the organs they can just
[1:04:16] take that organ out
[1:04:18] and hey guess what you get to live
[1:04:19] another 20 30 years
[1:04:21] but if you have one organ that's
[1:04:23] infected one organ that's weak
[1:04:26] right amen it can destroy
[1:04:30] the whole body kill the whole body
[1:04:32] because of that one place
[1:04:33] that one weak place amen
[1:04:39] and i'm going to say this you know as i
[1:04:41] get older
[1:04:43] we realize i realize that you can't eat
[1:04:47] this stuff that you used to eat as much
[1:04:50] you have to be more careful about what i
[1:04:51] eat
[1:04:53] you know um i thank god you know that by
[1:04:56] god's grace you know i have cousins
[1:04:58] different ones a couple of them
[1:05:00] have sugar diabetes different things and
[1:05:01] so forth but you know and but here
[1:05:03] lately
[1:05:06] i you know i i like to go to arby's i
[1:05:08] love arby's
[1:05:10] what is that called that that that uh
[1:05:14] chamoca that's a mocha you know in a
[1:05:17] sandwich or
[1:05:19] then i went by burger king and burger
[1:05:20] kings had their whopper
[1:05:22] on sale for two for five dollars
[1:05:25] you know and anywhere you go you buy a
[1:05:27] sandwich it's seven bucks i said but
[1:05:29] this is a good deal
[1:05:31] you know and and this is pretty good
[1:05:34] looking whopper my wife says you know
[1:05:35] that's pretty good got lettuce and onion
[1:05:37] tomato and
[1:05:38] i've been chowing down on whoppers now
[1:05:40] i've been eating pretty good
[1:05:41] and so i made it a habit you know i
[1:05:43] wanted to go eat my something but then
[1:05:45] you know
[1:05:45] here about two weeks ago i think i may
[1:05:48] have told some of y'all i don't know who
[1:05:50] all but i couldn't sleep
[1:05:53] i was laying on my back and i was
[1:05:55] getting numbness in my left arm a little
[1:05:57] bit on my right
[1:05:58] my chest begin to hurt real bad
[1:06:01] shortness of breath a little bit i
[1:06:03] almost called sister hannah
[1:06:05] i almost said what you know what are the
[1:06:07] symptoms of a heart attack because this
[1:06:08] is your feeling like someone just about
[1:06:10] what it did
[1:06:12] and i knew there's a i've had i've had a
[1:06:15] lot of heart pains or different things
[1:06:16] before but this was
[1:06:18] it stayed there all night all morning
[1:06:19] all the next day it was just
[1:06:21] really i was concerned you know that
[1:06:24] this was coming down and
[1:06:25] of course i got to thinking about all
[1:06:26] the whoppers
[1:06:28] all that fast food that i've been eating
[1:06:30] you know that just goes to show you off
[1:06:32] a lot of fast food folks
[1:06:34] you want to die quick but anyway and
[1:06:38] and you know the thing that i got from
[1:06:39] about it by god's grace you know i said
[1:06:41] honey all right this is it no more
[1:06:42] whoppers
[1:06:44] and by god's grace i've said i've got to
[1:06:46] change my knot and anybody that i think
[1:06:47] i told tommy i said pray for me and i've
[1:06:49] you know i have this and so forth
[1:06:50] i said you know i don't i don't believe
[1:06:51] i got to go in i'm not going to
[1:06:53] i don't want no stance huh i don't want
[1:06:56] no stance i don't want to do all that i
[1:06:57] want to spend 50 000
[1:06:59] scoping myself you know if i'll just go
[1:07:01] on a diet probably be alright
[1:07:02] reagan if i just eat right and diet you
[1:07:06] know and so forth
[1:07:07] you know and i thought you know that is
[1:07:09] so true spiritually
[1:07:11] i mean you just jam anything else down
[1:07:14] there and you're not going to be a
[1:07:15] healthy christian
[1:07:17] it's not good for you it's going to kill
[1:07:20] you
[1:07:20] if you just jam anything amen you got to
[1:07:22] be careful about what you eat
[1:07:24] amen and if it's so naturally it's that
[1:07:27] way spiritually
[1:07:29] how many believes you've got to make
[1:07:30] sure you eat good food
[1:07:32] and you'll be healthy and i've been
[1:07:35] doing that for about two weeks and i
[1:07:36] ain't had a pain and i think i've
[1:07:38] been getting slowly better ever since
[1:07:40] and it lasted only about two days i
[1:07:41] think after i really cranked down and
[1:07:44] drank a bottle of vinegar and a few
[1:07:45] other things that you know just really
[1:07:47] and uh you know
[1:07:51] bring some of that stuff to clean you
[1:07:52] out i said what's the fastest way to
[1:07:54] clear out your arteries you know and
[1:07:56] then you
[1:07:57] drink some of that stuff you'll really
[1:07:58] hate to drink that's what's good for you
[1:08:00] stuff
[1:08:00] you don't like you know some of them
[1:08:02] church servers that really step on your
[1:08:04] toes that maybe you don't like it but
[1:08:06] that's probably good for you isn't that
[1:08:08] right
[1:08:09] but anyway i learned that and i thank
[1:08:11] god for it you know but and so
[1:08:12] just anyway so i hope that helps
[1:08:15] somebody
[1:08:16] but think about it so the body if you
[1:08:18] have one part you know that doesn't work
[1:08:20] right it ended up killing the whole
[1:08:21] thing and that's the way it is even in a
[1:08:23] local body even in a local church
[1:08:25] when you have one person perhaps huh
[1:08:29] one person that's weak one person said
[1:08:33] sick how many knows that when you come
[1:08:36] in those double doors
[1:08:37] your atmosphere affects the whole
[1:08:39] service
[1:08:41] it affects everybody it affects the kind
[1:08:45] of service that we have when you're
[1:08:47] when you're either down or defeated or
[1:08:50] sick or weak or not spiritual you
[1:08:53] haven't been eating the way you should
[1:08:54] and you're just sick spiritually
[1:08:57] huh how many knows it affects everybody
[1:09:00] sure it does and i thought about this
[1:09:02] one statement brother manna made
[1:09:05] about the church in ephesians parallels
[1:09:07] our joshua is what we're very familiar
[1:09:09] with
[1:09:10] but the bible says your own behavior can
[1:09:13] knock somebody else out of getting
[1:09:15] healed
[1:09:16] your on misbehavior of unconfessed
[1:09:20] sin huh come to church
[1:09:23] all unconfessed and all my just all the
[1:09:25] listen it affects everybody
[1:09:27] unconfessed a few believers you can
[1:09:30] cause
[1:09:31] this church to bitterly fail
[1:09:35] huh how many believes that i mean please
[1:09:38] lord help us
[1:09:39] don't let me be the weak link in a body
[1:09:41] or a local body
[1:09:43] lord strengthen me when i come around
[1:09:45] amen to everybody i want to encourage
[1:09:47] people i don't want to be a
[1:09:48] downer to everybody or you know have sin
[1:09:51] in my life and
[1:09:52] you know sit there perhaps with doubt or
[1:09:55] frustration or whatever but
[1:09:57] be there with the holy spirit and pull
[1:09:59] from the gift of god
[1:10:00] cause somebody to get saved because i'll
[1:10:02] tell you right now when sinners come
[1:10:03] into the church
[1:10:04] they feel the atmosphere of the church
[1:10:08] people feel the atmosphere how many
[1:10:09] knows you can feel the atmosphere it
[1:10:10] don't take
[1:10:11] long to get each other's atmosphere and
[1:10:13] see what kind of atmosphere you hit
[1:10:15] amen and tell how healthy we are praise
[1:10:19] the lord
[1:10:21] that's right cause the church to
[1:10:23] brittlely fail and at the day of
[1:10:25] judgment
[1:10:26] you'll be responsible for every
[1:10:29] bit of it amen so lord help us all to
[1:10:33] remember
[1:10:34] each and every one of us god help us
[1:10:37] strengthen that weak spot amen that area
[1:10:39] where the devil perhaps can get you down
[1:10:41] get you depressed it may be
[1:10:43] it may be fear it could be any number
[1:10:45] thing it could be anything with any of
[1:10:46] us
[1:10:48] amen i don't know what your weak power
[1:10:49] spot is god does and you do
[1:10:53] amen how many how many know how many is
[1:10:55] with me you know where your weak spot is
[1:10:58] your weakness is amen it may be just
[1:11:01] simply that you don't take time to pray
[1:11:02] like you should
[1:11:04] amen perhaps not patient amen whatever
[1:11:07] it might be
[1:11:08] let me talk just a little couple more
[1:11:10] and we'll we'll bring it to early close
[1:11:12] tonight
[1:11:13] but about 30 40 minutes amen i thought
[1:11:15] well this should be about 30-40 minutes
[1:11:17] that's what brother brown said was a
[1:11:18] real good service so
[1:11:19] maybe we'll have a good 30 40 minute
[1:11:21] service tonight
[1:11:23] all right i better hurry and keep my
[1:11:25] word preachers
[1:11:26] shouldn't lie but anyway
[1:11:30] talk about just a couple more how many
[1:11:31] of those when you join the military
[1:11:33] let's just talk about the chain of the
[1:11:34] military command
[1:11:36] how many know that when you go to church
[1:11:38] when you go to join the military
[1:11:40] perhaps you're hunchback and you're
[1:11:42] crippled or whatever he might be hello
[1:11:45] you think they're gonna accept you
[1:11:49] why because you'd be a weak link in the
[1:11:53] chain
[1:11:54] you'd get somebody killed maybe several
[1:11:58] of them killed
[1:11:59] because you can't perform and do what
[1:12:01] needs to be done
[1:12:02] to keep every everybody has to be equal
[1:12:04] strength
[1:12:05] and so when you join the military they
[1:12:07] find a i've heard people that
[1:12:09] you know that had too flat-footed you
[1:12:11] know all kinds of things that they used
[1:12:13] to not
[1:12:14] let you in now of course nowadays you
[1:12:17] know
[1:12:18] it's terrible who can go up in there
[1:12:21] huh how'd you like to join the military
[1:12:26] amen and have your bunk beds there and
[1:12:28] find out there's one on top and one on
[1:12:30] the bottom of your bunk that's
[1:12:31] transsexual or something
[1:12:34] all
[1:12:41] but they just said anything you know
[1:12:43] that ain't gonna
[1:12:44] the morals the the morale of the people
[1:12:46] used to be
[1:12:47] all of that but now it's terrible isn't
[1:12:49] it but used to be man it had to be
[1:12:52] so strong so big not too short and all
[1:12:54] these other things
[1:12:55] you know because it's got to meet a
[1:12:56] criteria so that you don't have a weak
[1:12:58] spot
[1:13:00] because people's lives depend on it and
[1:13:02] i want to tell you something else i
[1:13:03] believe that's the way it is in a church
[1:13:05] amen when you've got a weak spot in the
[1:13:07] church it can cause people
[1:13:08] to die spiritually backslide
[1:13:12] because of a stumbling block amen people
[1:13:14] not being what they're supposed to be
[1:13:16] amen i hope we can all say lord jesus
[1:13:19] help me a little bit more tonight
[1:13:20] to strengthen that weak spot so i don't
[1:13:23] have a weak spot
[1:13:24] amen because that's you know i know
[1:13:27] satan's got a punch coming
[1:13:29] but brother brahm says that's why you
[1:13:30] pray so much more
[1:13:32] over that weak spot amen one more one
[1:13:35] more illustration beside the military i
[1:13:37] want to talk about
[1:13:38] just let's just say a football game take
[1:13:41] take a football game
[1:13:42] and you know usually it's a team that
[1:13:45] doesn't have
[1:13:46] any weak space places no weak spots
[1:13:49] in the chain because you all have
[1:13:51] probably watched football some of you
[1:13:52] guys have car races some of them maybe
[1:13:54] this out of the other but i've watched
[1:13:55] football several times probably won't
[1:13:57] this year not even kneeling anyway but
[1:14:00] they better watch them on the internet
[1:14:02] but anyway so
[1:14:03] listen so you see these football players
[1:14:06] you see these teams
[1:14:08] and when there's one wide receiver
[1:14:11] that can't keep up with the other wide
[1:14:13] receiver right
[1:14:14] in the nfl everybody's lightning fast
[1:14:17] anyway
[1:14:18] and if that wide receiver isn't fast
[1:14:20] enough that's going to be
[1:14:21] a place that they always use that wide
[1:14:23] receiver and they're going to throw him
[1:14:25] and throw him and they're going to be
[1:14:26] touched down after touchdown because of
[1:14:28] that one weak place
[1:14:30] huh so why do you know that's why they
[1:14:33] always
[1:14:33] it's amazing sometimes to watch them and
[1:14:36] to know that
[1:14:36] they'll come up they'll they'll be right
[1:14:38] on top of each other the defense one
[1:14:40] he'll be right there with another
[1:14:42] offense man and they'll be running and
[1:14:43] they'll do this
[1:14:44] or the other and perhaps they'll just
[1:14:45] jump up and knock the ball up just
[1:14:48] before he gets down and gets him you
[1:14:49] know
[1:14:50] and it's because it's equally matched
[1:14:53] let me tell you something if you're
[1:14:54] going to be equally matched with the
[1:14:55] devil you better
[1:14:56] not have any weak spots because the
[1:14:59] devil will absolutely take those weak
[1:15:01] spots into your life
[1:15:03] and destroy you with them if you can
[1:15:04] amen he'll have his victory he has his
[1:15:06] triumphs
[1:15:08] over our weak places
[1:15:11] how many believes that that's brother
[1:15:12] bam says you know a chain
[1:15:15] is only as strong as its weakest link
[1:15:19] amen so i just my it's just a thought
[1:15:23] that brought
[1:15:24] brother man i mean the lord jesus christ
[1:15:25] brought to my heart i thought about
[1:15:27] brother brown a statement that he made
[1:15:28] about that
[1:15:29] that chain that has that weak place and
[1:15:32] i don't know about you but in my heart i
[1:15:33] say lord jesus
[1:15:35] don't let me have a weak spot my
[1:15:37] brothers and my sisters are counting on
[1:15:39] me
[1:15:40] how many believes that we're counting on
[1:15:42] each other not to have those weak places
[1:15:44] and to be strong
[1:15:46] so that the lord can have complete
[1:15:48] control
[1:15:49] amen i was going to quit this quarter
[1:15:51] after i gotta mention this of just a
[1:15:52] little bit about joshua
[1:15:54] but abraham when he was talking about
[1:15:55] this in ephesian sparrows joshua he says
[1:15:58] you know
[1:15:58] when they went over and they captured
[1:16:00] jericho
[1:16:02] and they went around that city of seven
[1:16:04] times
[1:16:05] he says they didn't even need a band-aid
[1:16:08] that right no band-aids for the fingers
[1:16:11] usually we have to have amputations
[1:16:13] we have to have mass burials for all the
[1:16:15] people that got killed
[1:16:17] people hack and cut in every which
[1:16:19] direction and everywhere you can think
[1:16:21] of in a battle
[1:16:22] but these didn't even need a band-aid
[1:16:24] that's how perfect the battle was
[1:16:26] when there was no sin no weakness
[1:16:30] and the next one they went up to the ai
[1:16:33] i believe it was the next battle they
[1:16:35] fought
[1:16:36] amen and they were not supposed to take
[1:16:37] anything no gold no nothing but guess
[1:16:39] what
[1:16:40] aitkin took a little wedge of gold and
[1:16:41] all this other stuff and took it and he
[1:16:43] hit it
[1:16:43] and because of that one weak link 34 men
[1:16:46] or 38 men lost their lives
[1:16:49] right because of that weak spot
[1:16:54] amen my
[1:16:59] wouldn't it be something if they could
[1:17:00] have keep kept on winning everybody
[1:17:03] battle never
[1:17:04] needing a first aid kit never needing a
[1:17:07] band-aid
[1:17:08] how many believes that i believe that we
[1:17:11] can have complete victory
[1:17:13] in our lives if we'll cover that weak
[1:17:15] spot and say god make my weak spot
[1:17:17] stronger amen god bless you tonight
[1:17:20] let's stand
[1:17:22] musicians if you'll come
