[14:28] chapter

[14:50] 15 if there be therefore any consolation
[14:53] in C if any bows and
[14:58] meres
[15:06] let nothing be done through strife and
[15:07] vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let
[15:12] each esteem other better than
[15:20] themselves let this mind be in you which
[15:23] was also in Christ
[15:27] Jesus
[15:32] but made himself of no reputation and
[15:34] took upon him the form of a servant and
[15:37] was made in the likeness of
[15:47] men wherefore God also hath highly
[15:50] exalted him and given him a name which
[15:52] is above every
[15:57] name
[16:03] and that every tongue should confess
[16:05] that Jesus Christ is Lord and to the
[16:07] glory of God the
[16:20] Father for it is God which worketh in
[16:23] you both to Will and to do of his good
[16:27] pleasure
[16:31] this one together that you may be
[16:33] blameless and harmless the sons of God

[1:04:03] Revelations the fourth
[1:04:05] chapter
[1:04:10] amen this morning I want to talk about
[1:04:13] The Throne of God the Throne of God amen
[1:04:19] amen chapter 4 verse one after this I
[1:04:23] looked and behold a door was opened
[1:04:26] Heaven and the first voice which I heard
[1:04:28] was as it were a of a trumpet talking
[1:04:31] with me which said come up hither and I
[1:04:34] will show thee things which must be
[1:04:36] Hereafter and immediately I was in the
[1:04:38] spirit and behold a throne was set in
[1:04:41] heaven and one sat on the
[1:04:44] throne and he that sat was to look upon
[1:04:48] as Jasper and sardine stone if I'm not
[1:04:52] wrong it is the first tribe of Israel
[1:04:54] and the last tribe of Israel if I'm not
[1:04:57] wrong amen and those names represented a
[1:05:00] certain Stone amen and there was a
[1:05:02] rainbow round about The Throne inight
[1:05:04] like unto an emerald amen rainbow how
[1:05:07] many knows that always represents a
[1:05:10] covenant amen how is glad to be in an
[1:05:13] unconditional Covenant God said he would
[1:05:15] do it and he's going to do it amen and
[1:05:19] round about The Throne were four and 20
[1:05:21] seats and upon the seats was four and 20
[1:05:24] Elders sitting clothed in white rment
[1:05:26] and they had on their heads crowns of
[1:05:29] gold amen praise the Lord how many
[1:05:32] believes how many knows what gold
[1:05:34] represents deity amen eternal life how
[1:05:38] many believes will have be had given
[1:05:39] Paul said a crown of eternal life amen
[1:05:43] and out of the throne proceed Lightnings
[1:05:45] and thunderings and voices and there
[1:05:48] were seven lamps of fire burning Before
[1:05:51] the Throne which are the seven spirits
[1:05:54] of God and Before the Throne there was a
[1:05:57] sea of glass like unto Crystal and in
[1:05:59] the midst of the throne and round about
[1:06:01] The Throne were four beasts full of eyes
[1:06:04] before and behind amen now notice what
[1:06:07] these beasts look like amen and the
[1:06:09] first Beast was like a l Lion and the
[1:06:12] second beast like a calf the third Beast
[1:06:15] like the face of a man and the fourth
[1:06:17] Beast like unto a flying eagle and the
[1:06:19] four beasts had each of them six wings
[1:06:22] about them and they were full of eyes
[1:06:25] Within and they rest not day nor night
[1:06:28] saying holy holy holy can we say holy
[1:06:33] holy holy holy unto the Lord God
[1:06:37] Almighty which was and which is and
[1:06:39] which is to come and when those beasts
[1:06:42] give glory and honor and thanks to him
[1:06:44] that sat on the throne who liveth
[1:06:46] forever and ever the 4 and20 Elders fell
[1:06:50] down before him that sat on the throne
[1:06:52] and worshiped him that liveth forever
[1:06:53] and ever and cast crowns Before the
[1:06:56] Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to
[1:06:59] receive glory and honor and power for
[1:07:02] thou has created all things and for thy
[1:07:04] pleasure they are and were created may
[1:07:08] God add His blessings to the reading of
[1:07:10] the word this
[1:07:13] morning amen what it means to have
[1:07:16] eternal life amen amen what it means
[1:07:20] perfectly eternal life amen praise the
[1:07:26] Lord amen so we want to think about this
[1:07:29] for just a minute with the help of the
[1:07:31] Lord today what it's all about what
[1:07:33] happens this Throne amen first I want to
[1:07:37] say this that I read this heard brother
[1:07:39] B say this week talking about how that
[1:07:42] when the bride recognizes who she is
[1:07:46] amen the Rapture would take place amen
[1:07:49] and I got to thinking about how you know
[1:07:51] that things happen when you recognize
[1:07:54] things amen
[1:07:56] uh this just comes to my mind I ain't
[1:07:58] got it wrote down but I believe it is
[1:07:59] it's talked about you know having eyes
[1:08:03] they see you know even though they have
[1:08:05] eyes yet they see not is that right ears
[1:08:08] they hear not least at any time they
[1:08:11] should see with their eyes and hear with
[1:08:14] their ears and they would be converted
[1:08:16] and I would heal them so how many knows
[1:08:19] that when your eyes open when your ears
[1:08:22] open there's a transformation that takes
[1:08:25] place
[1:08:26] amen the First Transformation that takes
[1:08:29] place is that new birth now brother bam
[1:08:32] said you know that we were saved 2,000
[1:08:33] years ago ain't that right 2,000 years
[1:08:36] ago one place and another place of
[1:08:38] course we always was saved in the mind
[1:08:40] of God it just depends on how far back
[1:08:42] you want to go amen because we know that
[1:08:44] at Calvary that that price was paid is't
[1:08:48] that right that's where the purchase
[1:08:50] power was is when the he died at Calvary
[1:08:53] he paid for your salvation
[1:08:55] amen and so amen and he says you know
[1:08:58] it's about recognizing who you are amen
[1:09:03] and you never was saved on a certain day
[1:09:06] now you and I can take it to the time we
[1:09:08] can take it to the place I could take
[1:09:10] the philippy creek I could take you to
[1:09:13] amen down there in Florida amen and and
[1:09:15] think about all of that you know but you
[1:09:18] realize you brothers and sisters that
[1:09:20] you just recognized who you are that
[1:09:24] you're Son of God you're a daughter of
[1:09:26] God that he saved you 2,000 years ago
[1:09:29] you just recognized it you just come to
[1:09:32] it and when that
[1:09:36] happened there's a transformation that
[1:09:39] took place how many believe we need
[1:09:43] Transformations you know I got to
[1:09:45] thinking about that transword and it was
[1:09:47] like oh boy oh boy a lot of trans going
[1:09:50] on in this world isn't that right people
[1:09:53] are transing into this they're transing
[1:09:56] into that well let me tell you something
[1:09:58] the bride of Christ is transing into
[1:10:02] Christ amen it's not going to be her
[1:10:05] anymore but it's going to be him living
[1:10:07] in her she becomes
[1:10:12] him amen but why is that that all that's
[1:10:15] yourself is dead and it's Christ in you
[1:10:20] now no wonder the prophet could get so
[1:10:22] excited that he thought he could fly and
[1:10:24] then when he
[1:10:29] realized when you recognize who you
[1:10:31] really
[1:10:33] are it talks about he says and
[1:10:36] I will be there his God and he shall be
[1:10:39] my son you know we every people people
[1:10:42] are thinking about well when I get over
[1:10:44] there I'll be saved and I'll be God's
[1:10:47] child be God Son no you're God's son
[1:10:50] you're God's daughter
[1:10:52] now now are we Sons and Daughters of
[1:11:00] praise be to
[1:11:02] God there's something that
[1:11:06] happens when you recognize who you are
[1:11:10] that you're
[1:11:11] Eagle you hear this
[1:11:13] scream
[1:11:17] huh screaming don't bother
[1:11:23] Eagles Eagles scream
[1:11:27] I've never heard of a eagle
[1:11:31] sparking never heard of Eagle
[1:11:33] clucking he's always
[1:11:36] screaming can't make it sound I think
[1:11:38] brother Brad didn't you make it sound
[1:11:39] the other day he did pretty
[1:11:44] good I don't know that's the best I can
[1:11:47] do sounds like a caling right he needed
[1:11:51] to laugh need to lighten you up for
[1:11:52] what's coming amen oh oh my but that's
[1:11:57] right something aren't you glad aren't
[1:11:59] you glad that something happened in your
[1:12:03] life oh folks oh you want something deep
[1:12:06] deep deep deep I'm telling you something
[1:12:08] deep something
[1:12:09] happened you got Bor
[1:12:13] again amen the old man died and now you
[1:12:16] are a new creature in Christ your
[1:12:18] affections are
[1:12:19] on things above amen and the things of
[1:12:22] this world don't mean so much to us
[1:12:26] amen our jobs our money our fin all of
[1:12:28] that it's taking second
[1:12:30] place amen how many know but Jesus said
[1:12:33] you know seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:12:36] God and his righteousness don't put that
[1:12:38] second put that
[1:12:40] [Applause]
[1:12:42] first amen that's what a Believer
[1:12:46] does it's first
[1:12:49] foremost praise be to
[1:12:53] God when we just grasp
[1:12:56] let me just say something else that
[1:12:57] comes to mind you know there's some
[1:12:59] powerful things the prophet talked about
[1:13:01] in in Christ the mystery how to the how
[1:13:03] that the uh the bride becomes one with
[1:13:07] him is that right the church is going to
[1:13:10] be so much like him in order to be
[1:13:12] United there's so many prophecies
[1:13:14] there's so many quotes so many things
[1:13:17] amen that we and I believe that we've
[1:13:19] got to come to
[1:13:21] yet
[1:13:22] amen he didn't just say nothing things
[1:13:26] for the church to go the other
[1:13:28] way he said those things because there's
[1:13:31] going to be a people that is without
[1:13:33] spot that is without
[1:13:36] rinkle that believe every word that when
[1:13:39] he comes they're going to be
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:46] ready let me tell you something as the
[1:13:49] pastor of this church I can't do
[1:13:53] nothing I could try manufacture
[1:13:56] something I could try to do do this that
[1:13:59] or the other but it wouldn't do no good
[1:14:01] would it how many believe it's about
[1:14:04] what the Holy Spirit
[1:14:06] does it's about what go God does that's
[1:14:11] important cuz when he does something you
[1:14:14] don't want to be caught fighting against
[1:14:17] it cuz you're either on one side or on
[1:14:20] the
[1:14:21] other you either for or you're against
[1:14:24] it you can't stand in
[1:14:29] between we've come through hell and high
[1:14:35] waters reason I said hell is because
[1:14:38] I've got a quote here says it this way
[1:14:40] now a days they don't even believe in
[1:14:42] saying Hell in the
[1:14:44] Pulpit I believe in saying Hell in the
[1:14:46] Pulpit amen oh mercy we need men of God
[1:14:50] men who won't hold
[1:14:51] back
[1:14:54] amen my when you think about it you
[1:14:57] become I want to talk about the New
[1:14:59] Birth just a little bit can I because it
[1:15:02] leads to
[1:15:06] this you recognize who you
[1:15:09] are that you are now sons of God not
[1:15:14] will be brother say but you are now sons
[1:15:16] of God and it does not yet appear what
[1:15:19] we shall be but we know that when he
[1:15:21] shall appear we shall be like him amen
[1:15:24] he that hath his hope in him purifieth
[1:15:26] himself even as he is pure am
[1:15:35] amen when God accepts the
[1:15:38] sacrifice of your repentance amen is
[1:15:41] that right when you genuinely
[1:15:47] repent God accepts that sacrifice comes
[1:15:50] down with the Holy Ghost and he consumes
[1:15:53] that sacrifice he accepts
[1:15:59] it then listen to this the first Throne
[1:16:04] was in heaven judgment seat the second
[1:16:07] Throne was in Christ the third Throne is
[1:16:13] in
[1:16:18] man remember when John the Baptist seing
[1:16:22] the spirit of God like a dove coming
[1:16:25] down on
[1:16:26] Jesus is that
[1:16:30] right in Jesus dwelt the fullness of the
[1:16:33] godhead
[1:16:35] bodily let me tell you something when
[1:16:38] you genuinely repent when God accepts
[1:16:41] your repentance there's a
[1:16:43] dove that better come
[1:16:45] down are you with me there's a spirit
[1:16:49] that better come
[1:16:51] down but the B said whenever that Spirit
[1:16:54] come down on Jesus Christ Heaven and
[1:16:57] Earth kissed each other they embraced
[1:17:00] each other amen and when you get the
[1:17:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost Heaven and
[1:17:05] Earth kiss each other they Embrace each
[1:17:09] other God has come down to man he's come
[1:17:13] down to you I can't tell you enough God
[1:17:17] is now not up there on that Throne
[1:17:20] anymore but he's on the throne of your
[1:17:23] heart
[1:17:27] w
[1:17:28] wow W I could almost
[1:17:31] preach are you ready I might as well get
[1:17:34] ahead of myself mother B says now we are
[1:17:37] his victory the church is his victory we
[1:17:41] come forth in the last days with his
[1:17:42] glorious gospel showing his victory he

[1:17:48] proof of his
[1:17:53] victory know he died he he went to

[1:18:18] now just as two fighters would come into

[1:18:24] each other

[1:18:28] he says when I go in there I go in there
[1:18:30] to kill

[1:25:22] glory and power and strength I wouldn't
[1:25:24] have nothing if it wasn't

[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:33] you might as well get used to it you're
[1:25:35] going to fall down there might want to
[1:25:38] fall down here a time or
[1:25:48] two time to recognize who's worthy of
[1:25:52] the
[1:25:53] glory
[1:25:56] it's him that he is all and in all and
[1:26:01] it's all for his glory his honor his
[1:26:06] praise that's why the devil he wanted
[1:26:08] some praise and glory himself that's why
[1:26:10] when you find a man
[1:26:12] trying to get some glory and praise to
[1:26:14] himself it's a devil it's evil it ain't
[1:26:19] God Amen we don't need no glory of
[1:26:23] ourselves he's worthy of all glory
[1:26:26] praise be to God Amen but I thought
[1:26:30] about that oh my we are the evidence of
[1:26:36] his
[1:26:38] victory how many believe what did Paul
[1:26:41] say I thank God I thank Jesus who gives
[1:26:44] us the victory through Jesus
[1:26:48] Christ he did the
[1:26:50] battle how many know I didn't have to
[1:26:53] have nails put on my side I didn't have
[1:26:54] to have capital punishment I didn't have
[1:26:56] to die the flesh he did that for me he
[1:27:01] overcome death Hell In The Grave you
[1:27:03] didn't have to fight it he fought it and
[1:27:05] he gives you the
[1:27:10] victory can I say if people reject that
[1:27:13] they deserve to go to
[1:27:15] hell somebody rejects something that
[1:27:19] free God so rich in love that he writes
[1:27:24] kan's
[1:27:25] pardon he write every one of Cain's
[1:27:28] children a
[1:27:31] pardon is that right whosoever will let
[1:27:36] him come is that right whoo he invited
[1:27:39] them
[1:27:40] all for God so Lov the world that he
[1:27:42] gave his only begotten son that
[1:27:44] whosoever should believe him should not
[1:27:49] perish but have everlasting
[1:27:52] life we understand the depth of that we
[1:27:56] understand the depth of God in his
[1:27:58] understanding he knew who wouldn't and
[1:28:01] KN he knew who would he
[1:28:07] realized that say
[1:28:09] something that means go
[1:28:11] ahead you know if God would have seen
[1:28:14] that not one not one human being wanted
[1:28:19] it not one I want to ask you a real
[1:28:23] spiritual question
[1:28:24] would he have
[1:28:29] come would he have come if he knew
[1:28:32] nobody's
[1:28:35] accepted well somebody correct me if I'm
[1:28:39] wrong but I say he wouldn't
[1:28:41] have cuz God God don't brother B God
[1:28:45] don't run a half shod job if he does
[1:28:48] something he knows there's somebody
[1:28:51] that's going to want some amen would be
[1:28:54] fighting the air but he knew if just one
[1:28:57] would I believe he said if were just one
[1:29:00] would if he' to come all the way from
[1:29:01] glory for that one
[1:29:04] person aren't you glad that he did he
[1:29:07] came all the way from Glory cuz he knew
[1:29:09] you would want to receive it you would
[1:29:12] want Grace you would want him that's who
[1:29:14] he came for for the ones that did want
[1:29:16] him for he knew he would they would want
[1:29:19] [Applause]
[1:29:21] him
[1:29:23] amen praise be to God so what happens in
[1:29:27] the New Birth is is that God comes down
[1:29:32] and Thrones
[1:29:39] himself the third Throne the place where
[1:29:43] his throne is is your
[1:29:53] heart
[1:29:57] see men and women they live a good life
[1:30:01] and love God go to church and all these
[1:30:03] things by mental conception
[1:30:07] huh other words there's
[1:30:10] a but that's not where it is isin't that
[1:30:13] right but the real hiding place is in
[1:30:16] the heart when Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:30:18] comes into your heart he is with you
[1:30:22] with your
[1:30:25] temperment he's living his own life
[1:30:28] through his own will through you I want
[1:30:31] to stop there
[1:30:33] amen listen to
[1:30:35] this he says now the devil chose a man's
[1:30:38] head to control for his control tower
[1:30:41] but God CHS his heart ain't that right
[1:30:43] he makes him see things look through his
[1:30:45] eyes but yet God in his heart makes him
[1:30:48] believe things that he cannot see see
[1:30:50] God
[1:30:52] is on his heart
[1:30:54] and in the heart of man is the Throne of
[1:31:01] God you get it God made his throne in
[1:31:05] the heart of

[1:31:41] Throne there was seven stars the voice
[1:31:43] of the
[1:31:46] Stars oh my I'm getting ahead of myself
[1:31:48] you see there was more in Revelations 4
[1:31:51] he says and out of the throne proceeded
[1:31:54] Lightnings and Thunders and voices not
[1:31:56] just one voice but voices plural what is
[1:31:59] it God speaking to the church reflecting
[1:32:02] himself through the seven spirits and
[1:32:04] when a true anointing of God speaks it's
[1:32:08] the voice of
[1:32:10] [Applause]
[1:32:12] God I mean know when a minister even a
[1:32:14] child of God Son and Daughter of God
[1:32:16] speaking to somebody in the streets or
[1:32:19] wherever you might be when you're
[1:32:21] anointed to speak it it's not yet but
[1:32:24] it's God's voice there was
[1:32:27] voices did but bam say in the Judgment
[1:32:29] there was a voice of many Waters what
[1:32:32] was this voice it's the voice of the
[1:32:34] minister that's cried out to the people
[1:32:37] in every age standing there saying come
[1:32:39] the voice is cry up come to Christ come
[1:32:42] to come from the highways and the hedges
[1:32:44] come unto
[1:32:46] me flee to that Throne come back to the
[1:32:50] throne come back to
[1:32:52] God that's the voice that's going
[1:32:55] out W think about it folks this is the
[1:32:58] hour this is the time that God is
[1:33:00] crawling he's
[1:33:04] calling thund
[1:33:09] out amen before I go deeper into that I
[1:33:13] want to bring go back and kind of lay
[1:33:15] Little Foundation
[1:33:19] here how many loves the
[1:33:22] Lord
[1:33:25] amen this is be a real good
[1:33:29] study so now notice he talks about when
[1:33:34] he talks about The Throne of God he's
[1:33:36] preaching on the throne and I think
[1:33:38] Revelations first
[1:33:40] chapter not first chapter but the first
[1:33:42] sermon he did on Revelations 4 he says
[1:33:45] if you'll notice and he talks
[1:33:47] about Israel let's talk about The Throne
[1:33:52] here's where God dwelt and look here's a
[1:33:56] tribe North West South every side had a
[1:34:01] little canvas down here didn't show any
[1:34:03] over there but they had four tribes each
[1:34:08] on each side of God guarding it nobody
[1:34:12] comes to here unless you go through
[1:34:14] these tribes is it right so all four of
[1:34:17] them if you'll notice Dan is the head of
[1:34:19] three tribes Judah is the head of three
[1:34:21] tribes Reuben is the head of three
[1:34:23] tribes Eep is the head of three tribes
[1:34:25] that's 12
[1:34:27] see
[1:34:29] Judah remember he said that in the
[1:34:33] throne there was four beasts one was a
[1:34:36] lion one was a ox one was a man one was
[1:34:39] a uh flying eagle Dan represented the
[1:34:42] lion Reuben the man Ephraim an ox and
[1:34:46] Dan an
[1:34:47] eagle that
[1:34:49] right so you think about that and then
[1:34:51] also without reading all of this notice
[1:34:54] how he says that brother bam oh boy let
[1:34:56] me see
[1:34:58] here the lion what brother bam
[1:35:01] said this was Matthew Ox Mark man Luke
[1:35:06] Eagle
[1:35:08] John all of them pointing you and
[1:35:11] guarding the place where God is and
[1:35:15] that's guarding the book of Acts and
[1:35:18] that right and they were all actually
[1:35:20] pointing to he said but say acts 230
[1:35:24] cuz that's the way to get to
[1:35:28] God that's why repent everyone of you
[1:35:31] and they're all saying that repent amen
[1:35:33] that repentance and remissions of sins
[1:35:36] should be preached in his name beginning
[1:35:37] at Jerusalem and oh the Glorious thing
[1:35:40] my Revelation this morning is this amen
[1:35:43] that you know even the Tabernacle in the
[1:35:46] wilderness was a type of what was over
[1:35:48] there so I'm not saying that nothing's
[1:35:51] over there I don't know what all is over
[1:35:52] there but you know that brother said the
[1:35:55] third Throne is
[1:35:56] here in the heart of
[1:35:59] man and listen wasn't it exactly right
[1:36:02] that God used those four anointings and
[1:36:04] where are those four anointing coming
[1:36:06] forth from the throne which is in PE
[1:36:09] people and you and I are experiencing
[1:36:12] and manifesting the coming forth of the
[1:36:15] eagle age it flies higher than any other
[1:36:20] bird that anointing is coming forth from
[1:36:23] the on if you're not anointed this
[1:36:25] morning there's something wrong with
[1:36:30] you I think we can all admit that we
[1:36:32] would prefer a preacher that's
[1:36:37] anointed I like preaching under the
[1:36:39] anointing because I'll be honest with
[1:36:41] you sometimes I feel like I never leave
[1:36:43] the
[1:36:44] ground huh I'm here to tell you
[1:36:47] something it's the devil's business to
[1:36:50] keep us
[1:36:52] grounded
[1:36:54] when you come to church it's his
[1:36:55] business to give you all kinds of
[1:36:57] attitude and problems from Wednesday to
[1:37:00] Sunday so the time you get here you
[1:37:02] can't get what you got Wednesday so
[1:37:05] you'll sit there and not get nothing it
[1:37:06] doesn't matter how much the anointing is
[1:37:08] up here you've got to be anointed so now
[1:37:12] you see what I'm saying about it's the
[1:37:13] very third Throne of God Amen Better B I
[1:37:15] believe it was in the token he also in
[1:37:17] the token and also in Christ mystery he
[1:37:19] says that you and I become the blood of
[1:37:21] Jesus Christ because of the Spirit
[1:37:23] that's on the inside so the blood is
[1:37:26] where on the throne it's right there in
[1:37:28] your heart we are the blood for the
[1:37:31] people your mercy for the people your
[1:37:33] grace for the people your love for the
[1:37:36] people the raise and The Shining of the
[1:37:39] throne amen coming forth out of the
[1:37:41] church that's what evening like
[1:37:43] Tabernacle is to be is not about
[1:37:45] building a bigger Church a prettier
[1:37:46] Church having the bigger crowd it's
[1:37:48] about manifesting Jesus Christ it's
[1:37:50] about being Al light to your community
[1:37:52] it's about being life where you work at
[1:37:55] it's about reflecting Christ reflecting
[1:37:58] the throne the eagle

[1:38:06] honor and power amen you'll hear amen
