[20:59] [Applause]
[21:06] amen if we'll just go in the Psalms this
[21:08] morning we're going to go to Psalms
[21:15] 36 children can be dismissed for Sunday
[21:18] school
[21:23] y Psalms 36
[21:30] the transgression of the wicked saith
[21:32] within my heart that there is no fear of
[21:35] God before his
[21:42] eyes the words of his mouth are iniquity
[21:45] and deceit he has left off to be wise
[21:48] and to do good
[21:58] thy mercy oh Lord is in the heavens and
[22:01] thy faithfulness reacheth unto the
[22:13] clouds how excellent is thy loving
[22:15] kindness oh God therefore the children
[22:18] of men put their trust under the shadow
[22:20] of thy wings
[22:30] for with thee is the Fountain of Life
[22:32] and in thy light shall we see
[22:42] light let not the foot of Pride come
[22:44] against me and let not the hand of the
[22:46] wicked remove me there are the workers
[22:49] of iniquity Fallen they are cast down
[22:52] and shall not be able to rise God bless
[22:55] you may be seated brother Brian
[23:12] morning brothers and
[23:14] sisters if you would turn with me sorry
[23:17] about that to the 13th chapter of
[23:22] Matthew I was going to say something
[23:25] funny but I I'll let it slip about those
[23:28] first few verses there in
[23:31] that in that chapter of Psalms there
[23:33] that 36th
[23:35] chapter um so I've talked to brother
[23:39] Thomas last Sunday morning and I've uh
[23:43] there was some other costs that came
[23:44] through the
[23:46] church and I just for the rest of the
[23:49] winter we're at a point
[23:51] where uh other than the normal expenses
[23:55] which would be you know like cleaning
[23:57] supplies and you know the fellowship
[23:59] dimmer we're we're at a point where we
[24:01] have to hold so if you have something
[24:04] that you're you want the church to do it
[24:07] have make sure it goes through the
[24:09] trustees and then brother Thomas is the
[24:11] final approval for any of it the
[24:14] expenses for the church and the reason I
[24:17] bring that up is because uh after
[24:21] settling all the debts and I just want
[24:22] to be honest if some of the people who
[24:25] had since August until now hadn't used
[24:28] some of their own money we we're at
[24:30] about $5,600 in the general fund we
[24:33] would probably be probably down in the
[24:36] threes or the low fours right now if
[24:38] they hadn't done that so just remember
[24:41] if if it's any major expense it has to
[24:44] go through the trustees and brother
[24:46] Thomas is the final approval for that so
[24:49] if make sure if you have an expense that
[24:52] brother make sure you let me know that
[24:54] that expense has gone through the
[24:56] trustee board and brother Thomas and
[24:59] right now on the general
[25:00] fund uh is
[25:02] $5,600 that's where around
[25:05] $5,600 and I do keep a cash account I do
[25:09] carry a little cash with me to pay for
[25:11] those little bills so we don't write
[25:13] checks out of the uh out of the general
[25:15] fund but I was uh re last night
[25:19] listening to a message and um as I came
[25:22] to this 13th chapter here uh I'm going
[25:26] to start at the 37th verse
[25:29] and I
[25:30] was and you'll see where I'm going and I
[25:35] might be a few reading a few verses here
[25:38] but in starting at the 37th he talks
[25:41] about the psalm of talks about the
[25:44] parable not the psalm of the sewer and
[25:46] the seed and I'll just read starting the
[25:49] 37th verse and he answered and said unto
[25:52] them he that Seth The Good Seed is the
[25:55] son of man and the field is the world
[25:57] and the good seed are the children of
[25:59] the Kingdom but the tears are the
[26:01] children of the wicked one so you even
[26:04] see here there's two seeds a good seed
[26:06] and a bad seed and the enemy that sow
[26:09] them is the devil and the Harvest is the
[26:12] end of the world and the reapers are the
[26:14] angels as therefore the tears are
[26:17] gathered and burned in the fire so shall
[26:20] it be in the end of this world and we're
[26:22] com to that point now and the son of man
[26:25] shall send forth his angels and they
[26:27] shall get gather out of his kingdom all
[26:30] things that offend them which do
[26:33] iniquity and that you could go back to
[26:35] the 36th Psalm we just read the first
[26:37] four or five verses deal with that here
[26:39] too and shall cast them into the furnace
[26:41] of fire and there shall be welling in
[26:44] nashion of teeth then shall the
[26:46] righteous shine forth as the son in the
[26:48] Kingdom of their father who ha hear ears
[26:51] to hear let him here and that's where
[26:53] we're at this morning I hope you all
[26:55] have a listening ear to the word of God
[26:57] this morning
[26:58] and he goes on to say and again the
[27:00] Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a
[27:02] treasure which is hid in a field that
[27:05] which when a man hath found it he hid it
[27:08] and for Joy therefore goeth and sth all
[27:10] that he hath and buth the field and
[27:13] again the Kingdom of Heaven is like onto
[27:15] a merchant so I was thinking of these
[27:18] these two Parables here and the kingdom
[27:21] of heaven is like onto a merchant man
[27:23] seeking Godly pearls whose when he has
[27:26] found one pearl of great pride went and
[27:29] sold all he had and bought it and then
[27:32] he goes on as he finishes this here and
[27:35] the kingdom of heaven is like onto a net
[27:37] that was cast into the sea and gathered
[27:40] of every kind and which when it was full
[27:42] they drew to the shore and set down and
[27:44] gathered The Good Into The Vessel and
[27:47] cast the bad away and that's the same
[27:50] for us when you when you interreact with
[27:52] people out there in the world it's not
[27:55] you that pick the good out of the bad
[27:57] it's God that picks the good out of the
[27:59] bad all you're responsible for is to
[28:01] tell the people the truth and so shall
[28:04] it be at the end of the world and the
[28:05] angel shall come forth and sever the
[28:08] wicked from among the just you know all
[28:11] the years I've learned one simple lesson
[28:13] you can't make people do good you can
[28:15] present the truth to them you can lead
[28:17] them but they have to be willing to
[28:19] follow and if they won't follow you just
[28:21] got to be nice to him and just be kind
[28:24] to him and let God work it out in the
[28:26] end and so shall shall it be at the end
[28:28] of the world when the Angels shall sh
[28:30] forth and sever the wicked from among
[28:33] the
[28:33] just and shall cast them into the
[28:36] furnace of fire and there shall be a
[28:37] Welling and nashing of teeth and at this
[28:40] 52nd verse Jesus ask his disciples after
[28:44] all these Parables and all the
[28:46] revelation of these Parables he sets
[28:48] them aside and he teaches them what
[28:51] really The Parables mean in the 51st
[28:54] verse really speaks to me this morning
[28:56] he goes and Jesus said on to them have
[28:58] you understood all these things that
[29:01] I've said unto they said unto him yay
[29:04] Lord so we we know that did they really
[29:07] understand everything that Jesus was
[29:09] telling them they probably didn't
[29:11] understand it completely until the day
[29:13] of Pentecost and but this 52nd verse
[29:16] really stuck with me this morning it
[29:18] kind of jumps right out of there and and
[29:21] it goes back to what I was thinking I
[29:24] was thinking this morning as I was
[29:26] reading in in uh first
[29:28] Kings about you know the life of Solomon
[29:31] this morning and he goes back to this
[29:34] Merchant that bought that field or the
[29:37] businessman that sold everything to
[29:39] possess that one Pearl and I was
[29:42] thinking of Solomon's life he started
[29:44] good God gave him everything and at the
[29:47] end he veered off at the end and I I
[29:50] kind of think about myself as I get
[29:52] older we don't want to be that way we we
[29:56] want to be consistent and we want to
[29:58] have more at the end than we did at the
[30:00] beginning you if you get it all at the
[30:03] beginning and you don't hold on to it
[30:05] until the end what good is it for you
[30:08] how's it going to prosper you and I was
[30:10] thinking of this 52nd verse here and it
[30:12] said then said he unto them therefore
[30:15] every scribe which is instructed unto
[30:17] the kingdom of heaven so he's talking
[30:19] about the Scribe this is someone who
[30:22] studies the word of God sees the word of
[30:25] God for for what it is and he goes on to
[30:27] say instructed in the Kingdom of Heaven
[30:30] is like a man that is a householder
[30:32] which bringeth forth out of his
[30:34] treasures things new and old and that's
[30:37] the way I am this morning there's things
[30:39] that God taught me 40 years ago and
[30:42] there's things that God's teaching me
[30:44] today the Christian Life or the
[30:46] Christian experience you just don't get
[30:48] you just don't stop growing you just
[30:50] don't stop you have to keep adding daily
[30:54] to your experience in Jesus Christ this
[30:56] morning the experience I had when I was
[30:58] a 25y old isn't the experience I need
[31:02] now as a 65y old but God knows what we
[31:05] each need every day and you have to seek
[31:08] after it so God shows you what you need
[31:10] to be and I was thinking I I was
[31:13] sometimes when I sit down and read about
[31:14] Solomon and all the examples in the
[31:17] Bible people that didn't finish
[31:20] well I don't want to be like that as a
[31:22] 65 year old man myself I want to finish
[31:26] well I want to hold to what God has
[31:27] shown on me and I want to gain more as
[31:30] the my as this comes to an end and I was
[31:32] just wrote some I don't want to take a
[31:35] lot of time I'll get started and won't
[31:36] stop but I was thinking of some examples
[31:39] in the Bible where people
[31:41] added had the old and added to the new
[31:44] and the the prime example that spoke to
[31:47] me going through all the
[31:49] scriptures I'll just jump to it I hope I
[31:52] marked the right spot was in Timothy
[31:55] second Timothy the 4th chapter I was
[31:58] thinking of Paul's life here's a man
[31:59] that added new the old to the new Paul
[32:03] being a s Pharisee had a deep knowledge
[32:07] of the law and of the prophets but he
[32:10] took that law of the prophets and added
[32:13] the revelation of Jesus Christ to it so
[32:16] he had both the Old and the new and I I
[32:19] was thinking of that this morning in
[32:21] this fourth chapter I'll read a I won't
[32:24] read this I'll apolog I promise not to
[32:26] read this whole chapter and I charge
[32:28] thee this is what Paul said to
[32:31] Timothy I charge thee therefore before
[32:34] God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[32:36] judge the quick and the dead as
[32:38] appearing in his kingdom so he's given
[32:41] Timothy the younger man some knowledge
[32:44] here this morning preach the word and be
[32:46] instant in season and out of season
[32:49] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[32:52] longsuffering and Doctrine and a lot of
[32:54] times we forget that word there
[32:56] longsuffering but but he goes on to say
[32:58] for the time will come when they will
[33:00] not endure sound Doctrine but after
[33:03] their own lust they shall Heap to
[33:04] themselves teachers having itching ears
[33:07] and that's where we're at this morning
[33:08] people don't want to hear the truth
[33:10] anymore they'd rather have someone tell
[33:12] them a lie and be content in their life
[33:15] than to hear the truth and it's really
[33:18] it's really bad but that's the way it is
[33:21] they'd rather have someone lie to them
[33:23] so they can have an easy life and just
[33:25] keep going down the road without any and
[33:28] then another
[33:29] example and I I'll sit down after this
[33:32] this example I was thinking
[33:34] in I I mentioned this a lot Peter uh the
[33:39] Apostle Peter was the same way he had
[33:41] something old and he had something new
[33:42] at the end and uh I'll start at about
[33:45] the 11th
[33:46] verse well let me I'll just start at the
[33:50] 10th verse here and let God's word speak
[33:52] for itself but the day of the Lord will
[33:55] come as a thief in the night in which
[33:57] the heaven shall pass away with a great
[33:59] noise and the element shall melt with a
[34:02] fervent Heat and the Earth also and the
[34:04] works that sorry about that that's
[34:06] second Peter the 3r chapter the 10th
[34:09] verse also and the work therein shall be
[34:12] burned up seeing that all these things
[34:15] shall be dissolved what manner of a
[34:17] person ought you be in all holy
[34:20] conversation and godliness and we can
[34:22] say the same thing this morning Peter
[34:24] had the revelation of the word of God
[34:26] for his hour and we had have the same
[34:28] thing this morning and when you see the
[34:30] things going on out there in the world
[34:32] this morning and the years ever since
[34:36] all those things that are going on
[34:38] you're we're at that same place here
[34:41] this morning it goes on to 13 not reread
[34:45] the same verses nevertheless according
[34:48] to his promise look for the new the
[34:51] heavens and a new Earth where in
[34:52] dwelleth
[34:54] righteousness but I'm going back to what
[34:56] Peter says later down in this chapter
[34:58] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[35:01] for such things to be diligent you may
[35:03] be found in them in peace without spot
[35:06] blameless so it really strikes me a lot
[35:09] the Christian life is not a life of
[35:11] worrying or fretting or string over the
[35:14] things that are happening but it's a
[35:16] life live in peace and longsuffering
[35:20] because you know that you know that God
[35:22] has done it for you and he goes on to
[35:25] say here but I was thinking Peter had
[35:28] both he he he walked with Jesus he was a
[35:31] disciple of Jesus he was taught the law
[35:35] as a child and yet he acknowledges Paul
[35:38] the messenger in later on he
[35:40] acknowledges Paul I'm going to reread
[35:43] the same thing but starting at the 15th
[35:46] verse and account that the longsuffering
[35:49] of Our Lord is salvation even as our
[35:52] beloved brother Paul also according to
[35:54] the wisdom given him onto hath written
[35:58] onto you so we're no different we have
[36:01] that Revelation this morning in the
[36:02] message of the hour and he goes will be
[36:05] no different also in all his Epistles
[36:07] speaking in them of these things in
[36:10] which are some things hard to understand
[36:12] which they that are unlearned and
[36:14] unstable rest as they do also the other
[36:17] scriptures onto their own destruction
[36:19] and he goes on to say here yet ye
[36:22] therefore beloved seeing you know these
[36:24] things before beware least you also and
[36:28] that we're no different this morning
[36:30] ourselves being led away with the error
[36:32] of the wicked fall from your own
[36:34] steadfastness and goes back to what I
[36:36] was saying earlier I was thinking
[36:39] Solomon's not the only you can go
[36:41] through the Bible numerous examples of
[36:44] people that started well but finished
[36:46] bad or people that what's funny some of
[36:49] the people started bad but finished
[36:52] really well but we want to be that
[36:54] person that starts right and finishes
[36:56] well and I'll just finish therefore
[36:58] beloved seeing you know these things
[37:00] before least you being led away with the
[37:02] error of the wicked fall from your own
[37:05] stead fness but grow in Grace in the
[37:08] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus

[1:06:46] church you sound like God's done
[1:06:49] something good for you this
[1:06:50] week he certainly been good to me I know
[1:06:53] that I tell you what I the singing back
[1:06:57] there just just got me uh got me uh
[1:07:00] ready to go so that's what it's about
[1:07:03] thank you brother Josh for pacing the
[1:07:05] atmosphere so we just want to continue
[1:07:07] to carry that on and have church and
[1:07:10] we're not going to put any limitations
[1:07:11] on God this morning we're just going to
[1:07:14] let God have his way you know a lot of
[1:07:16] times I think we come to church and and
[1:07:18] I've been guilty my family's been guilty
[1:07:20] and if you're honest you'll ra you could
[1:07:22] raise your hands and say we limit we
[1:07:25] limit God we put constraints on God when
[1:07:27] we say uh I've got an appointment after
[1:07:29] church I got to go to dinner I got if I
[1:07:32] know the preacher is going to go till
[1:07:33] about 12:30 and man if I can Fellowship
[1:07:36] for about 10 minutes and then I can get
[1:07:37] to Clarksville by 1:15 we can we can get
[1:07:42] there I found out the best policy is
[1:07:45] just don't plan
[1:07:48] anything because when we plan things we
[1:07:51] put a constraint on God and basically
[1:07:53] what we're saying whether we like to
[1:07:54] believe it or not is is
[1:07:56] God I'm going to give you an hour and a
[1:08:01] half and then my time is so important I
[1:08:04] need to go feed my belly I need to go
[1:08:06] take a nap I need to go watch a football
[1:08:13] game
[1:08:19] well no
[1:08:21] limitations if we want to see God move
[1:08:23] in the way that we desire no
[1:08:27] limitations turn with me if you would as
[1:08:29] you're turning uh to first Thessalonians
[1:08:31] and 2
[1:08:34] Corinthians I'm going to get into a
[1:08:36] little thought this morning
[1:08:39] and we'll see the direction it takes us
[1:08:41] and I tell you I started this and I
[1:08:43] thought well this is is going to be one
[1:08:45] phenomenal service and the more I looked
[1:08:47] at it I thought man this is going to be
[1:08:49] 20 or 30
[1:08:51] services and because it could go so many
[1:08:53] different directions and so I going to
[1:08:55] look at a thought as you earmark those
[1:08:58] two tabs 1 Thessalonians and 2
[1:09:00] Corinthians but I'm going to look at a
[1:09:02] thought this morning the King's Highway
[1:09:04] thankful to have my parents here with me
[1:09:06] this morning and and uh so they's able
[1:09:09] to come and we appreciate that and our
[1:09:10] visitors a different ones so but I want
[1:09:13] to read this to you the prophet said no
[1:09:15] matter how hard it
[1:09:17] comes how many knows we're in hard times
[1:09:21] no matter how hard it comes no matter
[1:09:22] what it looks like what anybody says I
[1:09:25] want to with patience listen now I want
[1:09:28] to with patience not fretting he said a
[1:09:31] person can't have patience and be
[1:09:32] fretting all the time but you just got
[1:09:35] to set yourselves straight right there
[1:09:38] and walk right on no matter what takes
[1:09:42] place move right on because you see
[1:09:47] storms are going to come troubles are
[1:09:49] going to come hardships are going to
[1:09:51] come hurts are going to come
[1:09:52] disappointments will come but you set
[1:09:54] yourself and you move right
[1:09:58] on you see brothers and sisters God
[1:10:01] expects those who travel on this way to
[1:10:03] live a life of
[1:10:05] Holiness he expects that life of
[1:10:07] Holiness he expects us if we're going to
[1:10:08] have that glorious privilege to commune
[1:10:10] and to fellowship with God it's going to
[1:10:12] take a Holiness a holy way of living and
[1:10:16] that Holy way of living is a way of life
[1:10:18] and it don't matter what comes our way
[1:10:21] it don't matter the tra the challenges
[1:10:23] the struggles the disappointments those
[1:10:25] things things don't matter those are
[1:10:27] emotions those are emotions of a
[1:10:30] situation that you're going through it
[1:10:32] doesn't change how you live for
[1:10:36] God and so we're looking at this and and
[1:10:39] I want to speak this morning on the
[1:10:40] King's Highway and this would I guess we
[1:10:43] would say it could be part one of the
[1:10:45] King's Highway but the bride of Christ
[1:10:48] will walk so close in his way and he'll
[1:10:51] represent him so well because they're
[1:10:53] walking a different Road than the rest
[1:10:56] of the
[1:11:00] world first Thessalonians let's read 4
[1:11:03] and seven two simple scriptures for God
[1:11:05] hath not called us unto uncleanness but
[1:11:08] unto
[1:11:10] Holiness Holiness it didn't say uh it
[1:11:14] didn't say he called us unto worry or
[1:11:16] unto fear or unto uh
[1:11:19] depression no he called us unto Holiness
[1:11:23] the rest our emotions so no matter what
[1:11:26] you go through you may have some fear
[1:11:27] you may have this but it don't stop the
[1:11:29] way you serve
[1:11:31] God second Corinthians 6 and
[1:11:37] 17 say Amen when you got it got
[1:11:41] it wherefore come out from among them
[1:11:44] and be ye separate saith the
[1:11:49] Lord you may have your seats and the
[1:11:51] Lord add His blessings to the reading of
[1:11:53] the word this morning
[1:11:56] so we look at these two scriptures here
[1:11:58] and and looking at these and I got to
[1:12:00] thinking about them and you know I
[1:12:01] thought this these scriptures aren't
[1:12:03] something that we we should do or that
[1:12:05] God just asked us to do but this is
[1:12:08] something that we must do this is
[1:12:10] something that God requires these
[1:12:12] scriptures and all scriptures for that
[1:12:14] matter when we take this word and we
[1:12:16] begin to dig into this word and look
[1:12:17] into it these are not just mere
[1:12:20] suggestions this is a way of life this
[1:12:23] is the road that we follow this is the
[1:12:26] map that we follow and by following this
[1:12:28] map is the only way you're going to get
[1:12:31] to the
[1:12:32] destination that you're longing
[1:12:35] for you see we have to have a direction
[1:12:38] in
[1:12:39] life we we make decisions we go down
[1:12:41] roads we take a path we do this we do
[1:12:43] that where we go to school where we who
[1:12:45] we who we hang out with the friends we
[1:12:48] have the the the the the the girls you
[1:12:51] date the boys you date who you'll marry
[1:12:53] all these things are decisions that
[1:12:55] begin to take place and it's lining up
[1:12:57] the direction that you're going in your
[1:12:59] life but see as Believers we've been
[1:13:02] given a GPS system that GPS system is
[1:13:07] God's provided
[1:13:12] sermons brother Steve we've been given
[1:13:15] God's provided sermons preached from
[1:13:17] 1940s to
[1:13:19] 1965 God's provided Service uh sermons
[1:13:22] and they were preached with pinpoint
[1:13:24] accuracy
[1:13:26] accuracy that no human could do accuracy
[1:13:29] that was only given by God himself you
[1:13:33] have to have that accuracy if you're
[1:13:35] going to arrive to your
[1:13:38] destination than you

[1:16:15] people we're to be a separate people we
[1:16:18] belong to Christ and there ought to be a
[1:16:20] noticeable difference between the
[1:16:23] believer the the Born Again Holy Ghost

[1:17:55] Highway you see this world is full of
[1:18:00] distractions it's full of distractions
[1:18:02] and and it's full of
[1:18:06] roadblocks it's full of
[1:18:09] detours and they'll set you back if
[1:18:11] you're not
[1:18:12] careful I tell you me and uh me and
[1:18:15] brother John went to to Johnson City

[1:18:37] something
[1:18:41] distracted we go on down the road two or
[1:18:43] three times this happens I said man we
[1:18:46] these people going have to pay attention
[1:18:48] what they're doing and then all of a
[1:18:49] sudden John watch the
[1:18:52] breaks you know we're starting to Skid
[1:18:54] the the trailer

[1:19:07] for four
[1:19:09] days got an orange sticker in the
[1:19:12] window and everybody's done slowed down
[1:19:15] and looking at that
[1:19:18] distracted distracted these distractions
[1:19:21] are coming there and brothers and
[1:19:23] sisters we're living in the midst
[1:19:25] of end time
[1:19:27] prophecy we can't allow distractions to
[1:19:29] detour us off of our
[1:19:32] road because these distractions are
[1:19:34] going to come and they're going to slow
[1:19:35] you down they're going to try to hinder
[1:19:36] you but as Believers we have to keep our
[1:19:38] faith dependent on Jesus
[1:19:41] Christ now you watch what's fixing to
[1:19:44] happen in a few short days we are fixing
[1:19:47] to as a nation we're going to decide who
[1:19:49] will be the 47th president of our
[1:19:52] country
[1:19:54] oh I got your ears
[1:19:57] now and we're going to decide who that
[1:19:59] is and as patriotic as we are as
[1:20:03] Believers we know that that outcome has
[1:20:06] already been
[1:20:09] predetermined before the foundation of
[1:20:12] the world this outcome was already been
[1:20:13] predetermined by a higher power and we
[1:20:17] as Christians shouldn't put our faith in
[1:20:19] Donald
[1:20:21] Trump you sure shouldn't put it in
[1:20:29] well I got a little political forgive
[1:20:32] me but the truth is we don't we don't
[1:20:35] put our dependability in them because
[1:20:37] you can't depend on Donald Trump you
[1:20:39] can't depend on Camala Harris you can't
[1:20:42] depend on the Republicans you can't
[1:20:44] depend on the Democrats go ask the
[1:20:47] people in the Carolinas and in in
[1:20:49] Tennessee where's their government
[1:20:52] nowhere to be found they said they told
[1:20:55] us the other day it's just people coming
[1:20:57] together it's people from this community
[1:20:59] and that state and this state and that
[1:21:00] state and he kept naming state after
[1:21:03] state after State what was it they care
[1:21:05] about each
[1:21:09] other and here we see uh we we see that
[1:21:12] we're we see what the media
[1:21:15] calls the road to the White
[1:21:19] House are you with me we're on a road to
[1:21:23] heaven
[1:21:24] they're focused on a road to the White
[1:21:27] House so they're focused on this road to
[1:21:30] the White House and their focus has
[1:21:31] changed over time their agendas have
[1:21:35] changed over time because they will do
[1:21:38] whatever it takes to get into that white
[1:21:40] house because in that white house they
[1:21:43] have power in that white house they have
[1:21:46] authority and so they're going to do
[1:21:48] whatever it takes to get in there to be
[1:21:50] the president of the United States no
[1:21:52] matter what but brothers and sister
[1:21:54] sisters I'm not worried about the road
[1:21:57] to the White
[1:21:58] House I'm not worried at all about the
[1:22:00] road to the White House this morning I'm
[1:22:02] walking on another highway I'm focusing
[1:22:05] on a highway that goes far beyond what
[1:22:07] the White House can give me a highway
[1:22:10] that take me much much greater places
[1:22:12] than anything Donald Trump could ever
[1:22:14] give
[1:22:17] me this highway I'm talking about is a
[1:22:20] healing
[1:22:21] highway it's a highway that you can walk
[1:22:23] when you say Lord Lord I'm in despair
[1:22:25] Lord I'm hurting Lord I'm I'm stricken
[1:22:28] with the disease Heal Me Lord walk that
[1:22:31] highway it's a highway that that that
[1:22:34] you can go down through there and and
[1:22:36] it's a highway of Deliverance and
[1:22:38] freedom that you don't have to be bound
[1:22:41] to the things that hold you
[1:22:44] back it's a overcoming highway it's a
[1:22:48] highway of life it's a highway that was
[1:22:51] paved by the blood of Jesus Christ on
[1:22:53] the cross of calvary
[1:22:55] it's the any other highway I'm going to
[1:22:57] tell you is a highway of
[1:23:03] death Listen Now by winning this
[1:23:07] election whoever wins they're going to
[1:23:10] come the become the voice to the entire
[1:23:14] world you say where are you going with
[1:23:16] this you see they have
[1:23:19] influence they have influence to to make
[1:23:22] decisions and they have influence to to
[1:23:25] help other leaders make decisions around
[1:23:27] the world good bad or ugly that's the
[1:23:30] truth of it whether you like it or
[1:23:32] whether you don't decisions are going to
[1:23:34] be made in that white house that are
[1:23:36] going to bring end time prophecies to
[1:23:40] pass so why are we worried about an
[1:23:49] election so we shouldn't let the results
[1:23:51] of this election Shake us we shouldn't
[1:23:54] let the results discourages because
[1:23:56] either way I'm going to keep walking in
[1:23:57] faith I'm just going to keep
[1:24:00] walking no matter what comes my way no
[1:24:02] matter what the world sends at me I'm
[1:24:04] going to keep
[1:24:06] walking you say well you may have hard
[1:24:08] times Keep On
[1:24:10] Walking you may get sick not be able to
[1:24:12] go to the hospital I'm going to keep on
[1:24:14] walking because if he was a Healer then
[1:24:16] he's a Healer today I'm going to keep
[1:24:19] [Applause]
[1:24:22] walking you know the country is not the
[1:24:25] country it once
[1:24:27] was I heard my my my father here the
[1:24:29] other day my dad the other day he said I
[1:24:31] wish you could I wish you could know the
[1:24:33] country I knew that's right yeah he said
[1:24:37] I hate it for my
[1:24:40] grandkids this country he said will
[1:24:42] never be what it once
[1:24:44] was I wish I could you could live the
[1:24:47] country we liveing but let me tell you
[1:24:49] it's not going to be what it once was
[1:24:51] it's not coming back it's not based on
[1:24:53] the principles of which it was founded
[1:24:56] on her ethics her oral her morals the
[1:24:59] values that came from Hebrew and
[1:25:01] Christian scriptures that shaped this
[1:25:03] nation when it was incepted into the
[1:25:06] world as the United States of America no
[1:25:09] longer
[1:25:11] exist you know Philadelphia has what we
[1:25:14] call the Liberty
[1:25:16] Bell somebody somebody some of y'all
[1:25:18] probably seen it right the Liberty Bell
[1:25:20] raise your hand if you seen
[1:25:22] it y'all didn't see that that when y'all
[1:25:24] was up
[1:25:26] there we're all familiar with the
[1:25:29] Liberty Bell and when that Liberty Bell
[1:25:31] was was was was cast they put an
[1:25:34] inscription on that Liberty Bell and it
[1:25:36] says Proclaim Liberty throughout all the
[1:25:38] land unto all the inhabitants
[1:25:43] thereof that's Leviticus
[1:25:48] 25
[1:25:52] 1776 they took and they put the the very
[1:25:54] scripture out of Leviticus that was
[1:25:57] given during the time of a
[1:25:59] jubilee you look back in your Bible and
[1:26:01] read Leviticus 25 it's talking about the
[1:26:04] Jubilee year every 50 years there's a
[1:26:06] jubilee there's Freedom if you're you
[1:26:08] can go you can start your own way so
[1:26:10] they put that on the Liberty Bell but I
[1:26:12] want you to know
[1:26:14] this in
[1:26:16] 1798 John Adams gave this warning to the
[1:26:19] people and you listen to this our
[1:26:21] constitution was made only for a more
[1:26:24] moral and religious
[1:26:26] people listen now it is Holy inadequate
[1:26:30] to govern of any
[1:26:35] other did you hear what I said our
[1:26:38] constitution was made only for moral and
[1:26:41] religious people where's the country's
[1:26:42] morals where's our where's the people's
[1:26:44] morals
[1:26:45] at and it and he said it is Holy
[1:26:49] inadequate to the government of any
[1:26:51] other it can't govern those people
[1:26:55] the government cannot govern people
[1:26:57] without morals or religious
[1:27:00] background well y'all getting quiet on
[1:27:02] me but let me tell you this that's the
[1:27:04] way it is with
[1:27:06] us if we we begin to Veer and we begin
[1:27:09] to get off of that road and we begin to
[1:27:11] waver off of the the very foundation of
[1:27:13] the road we're standing on if we're not
[1:27:15] careful the word of God can no longer
[1:27:17] govern us do you realize that that's how
[1:27:21] important it is that you stay right with
[1:27:22] the word you stay moral you stay ethical
[1:27:25] you stay exactly with what that word
[1:27:27] says and under that you'll be governed
[1:27:30] by God
[1:27:34] Almighty I'm giving you some stats here
[1:27:37] to lay a foundation for what's to come
[1:27:39] fast forward 208
[1:27:43] years Barack Obama June 28th
[1:27:47] 2006 I'll read it as just as he
[1:27:49] delivered it whatever we once were we
[1:27:52] are no longer a Christian Nation at
[1:27:55] least not just we are also a Jewish
[1:27:58] Nation a Muslim Nation a Buddhist Nation
[1:28:00] a Hindu nation and a nation of
[1:28:08] nonbelievers a nation of
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:28:16] nonbelievers let's go average countries
[1:28:19] this is just some stats for you your
[1:28:21] average country typically lasts 150 8
[1:28:24] years Empires stick around for
[1:28:28] 250 so where does that place
[1:28:31] us this last July this past July our
[1:28:34] country turned 248 years
[1:28:37] old you say why are you bringing all
[1:28:39] this out I'm bringing all this out to
[1:28:42] prove to you that these politicians are
[1:28:45] in place for a
[1:28:47] reason things happen for a reason as
[1:28:50] Believers when we heard Barack Obama
[1:28:52] think about this I know many of you
[1:28:54] remember this in 2006 when Barack Obama
[1:28:56] made that statement and it angered
[1:29:00] us it made us angry as as Christians
[1:29:03] that the then president of the United
[1:29:05] States could say such a statement for
[1:29:07] the whole world to hear that that he
[1:29:10] could Proclaim we are no longer a
[1:29:12] Christian Nation and We're a nation of
[1:29:15] unbelievers how many of you did it make
[1:29:17] Angry come on
[1:29:19] church thank you sister
[1:29:21] Robin yeah if made us angry that he
[1:29:25] could say such as
[1:29:27] that and it and it angered us but it
[1:29:30] ought to not have angered us because all
[1:29:33] he was doing is it should have opened
[1:29:35] our eyes because he begins to speak
[1:29:38] prophecy he begins to speak what has
[1:29:40] happened and we look at this and and
[1:29:42] remember they have a voice for a reason
[1:29:45] they're walking a different Road their
[1:29:47] motives are different he was making a
[1:29:49] declaration of the direction we were
[1:29:52] going as a nation that's
[1:29:56] right and it made us
[1:29:58] mad because we're I don't want to say
[1:30:01] proud but maybe we are a little bit
[1:30:03] proud to be American
[1:30:07] Christians and we should be that God
[1:30:09] chose us over so many to live in this
[1:30:12] country and to and to be able to see and
[1:30:15] understand and to be chosen by God that
[1:30:17] ought that ought uh give us some some
[1:30:20] pride in the right sense
[1:30:24] but I want you to watch what's happening
[1:30:26] I'm going to I'm going to read to you a
[1:30:27] little bit so you stay awake
[1:30:29] okay
[1:30:31] snowballing it's a dynamic is being
[1:30:34] driven by the acceleration and switching
[1:30:36] among young Christians ages 15 to
[1:30:39] 29 people under 30 tend to Grapple with
[1:30:43] identities of all
[1:30:48] kinds you got men being women women
[1:30:51] being men women being cat C men being
[1:30:55] dogs I tell you what I seen something
[1:30:57] the other day I thought this can't be
[1:30:59] it's got to be a joke it was not a
[1:31:01] joke it came across on the screen there
[1:31:05] an adult litter
[1:31:08] box did you hear what I said you you
[1:31:10] know that's that's where a cat goes to
[1:31:12] use the
[1:31:13] bathroom an adult litter box in
[1:31:17] somebody's
[1:31:18] house a big old
[1:31:21] sandbox and she was demonstrating how
[1:31:23] she cleaned her litter
[1:31:29] box they grapple with identities of all
[1:31:33] kinds says but there is a second Dynamic
[1:31:35] that began in 1990s that added a new
[1:31:38] layer of change keep in in mind these
[1:31:41] dates starting in the mid 1990s it
[1:31:43] became more common for adults in middle
[1:31:45] age and Beyond to discard their
[1:31:48] Christian
[1:31:50] identity so in 1990 that's about 1990
[1:31:54] let me get my dates right 1996 I got
[1:31:58] married and if I had not held on to my
[1:32:00] Christian identity and been like a many
[1:32:02] of the world who begin to leave the
[1:32:04] Christian identity what would what
[1:32:06] happened to those
[1:32:08] children when those families decided
[1:32:10] we're not a Christian family anymore and
[1:32:12] they begin to have
[1:32:16] Offspring you see where this is
[1:32:20] going listen now
[1:32:23] it gets more interesting 95 listen to
[1:32:26] this 95% or more of people who were born
[1:32:30] prior to
[1:32:31] 1940 so if you were born prior to
[1:32:34] 1940 and were raised Christian you were
[1:32:37] still Christian at the age of
[1:32:39] 65 they were
[1:32:42] solid they were solid there was things
[1:32:45] that went on in the early 1900s you had
[1:32:47] the Aus of meetings you had the the
[1:32:49] meetings that coming up and the Holy
[1:32:50] Ghost was moving across the country and
[1:32:52] people were solid in Christ
[1:32:55] they were solid in in the movement of
[1:32:58] God watch this though but among those
[1:33:01] that were born in the 40s 50s and
[1:33:05] 60s did you hear what dates I said the
[1:33:07] 40s 50s and 60s there has been a more
[1:33:11] substantial movement away from
[1:33:13] Christianity after the age of
[1:33:17] 30 so during the time when the prophet
[1:33:20] messenger stepped onto the scene and
[1:33:21] began to reveal the message of the hour
[1:33:25] 40s 50s or 60s there was a
[1:33:32] turn are you with
[1:33:36] me listen what he says notice in
[1:33:39] Revelations three he said when he come
[1:33:41] in the last day he prophesied he would
[1:33:43] come in the last day and how did he find
[1:33:45] the church Rich need of nothing set as a
[1:33:48] queen and he can he can see no sorrow
[1:33:51] the church he's talking about and they
[1:33:53] put him on the the outside of the
[1:33:56] church 40s 50s 60s up until then
[1:34:01] solid now that the revealed word has
[1:34:07] come they had no use for
[1:34:10] him they put him at without the camp and
[1:34:14] she didn't know that she was blind and
[1:34:16] naked and miserable she didn't know it
[1:34:18] but now we find him again in This Day
[1:34:21] 1964 the message going beyond the the
[1:34:24] camp now we find him again in this day
[1:34:26] as the Bible would say put outside the
[1:34:29] camp they don't want
[1:34:33] him they rejected him
[1:34:37] again he said with their counsels they
[1:34:40] would prefer prefer today like they did
[1:34:43] back then to put him on trial when the
[1:34:45] word is on trial what happened they
[1:34:47] rejected again and what they did they
[1:34:49] accepted barabus a murderer so in the
[1:34:52] 40s 50s and 60s they would rather have
[1:34:55] the spirit of a murderous Spirit over
[1:34:57] the revealed word of the
[1:35:00] hour and you wonder why there was such a
[1:35:02] fallen away because they chose
[1:35:09] barabus he said and today because listen
[1:35:12] today because they have rejected the
[1:35:14] word and the perfect Vindication of the
[1:35:17] hour they have sold
[1:35:21] out right
[1:35:24] this hurts our patriotic
[1:35:29] Soul they deny his word they deny his
[1:35:33] baptism they deny his power they deny
[1:35:36] his signs so everything that they saw
[1:35:39] everything they witnessed every Miracle
[1:35:41] every limb restored every eyeball be
[1:35:44] built this was
[1:35:46] witnessed eye to
[1:35:49] eye this is not some story people sit in
[1:35:52] the front pews and saw children's eyes
[1:35:55] be formed in the sockets of their
[1:35:59] head people sat on the front row and
[1:36:01] watched dead be
[1:36:03] raised people who were dead in the
[1:36:06] street in in the aisles and they were
[1:36:08] prayed for and they rose up they saw it
[1:36:10] with their own eyes they saw limbs of of
[1:36:14] of of children who had
[1:36:16] Polio to come back out
[1:36:22] straight and they Den Den that
[1:36:25] power they deny that power they deny
[1:36:28] that sence he said no they want
[1:36:31] Creeds so they're taking their Creeds
[1:36:33] above what God is doing in this hour so
[1:36:37] where does that take us where is that
[1:36:38] leading us I say that to say this stay
[1:36:42] focused stay focused on the on the word
[1:36:45] of the hour stay focused on what God is
[1:36:48] doing
[1:36:49] today don't look and want better
[1:36:52] tomorrow for America it's not
[1:36:55] coming you say man you're
[1:37:00] hard stay focused don't be deceived
[1:37:03] because what happens when you're deceive
[1:37:04] you get led into a sleepy mode and you
[1:37:07] begin to fail to realize what's even
[1:37:10] happening around
[1:37:11] you and all this stuff that you
[1:37:13] shouldn't be concerned with begins to
[1:37:15] concern
[1:37:17] you and you become such a political
[1:37:20] Advocate that you better be careful I
[1:37:23] have to to be
[1:37:24] careful because we do want what's best
[1:37:28] it'd be nice to have eggs at $2
[1:37:32] again
[1:37:34] $3 a gallon of meal it'd be nice to be
[1:37:36] able to go buy a gallon of meal I've
[1:37:37] seen where somebody had their grocery
[1:37:39] bill that was $75 like so many years ago
[1:37:42] and they run the same bill again through
[1:37:44] the app at Walmart and it was
[1:37:47] $240 for the very same
[1:37:50] products now my my pocketbook tells me I
[1:37:53] want
[1:37:58] that but my but my my my highway that
[1:38:02] I'm on says look unto
[1:38:06] me there's a call that's going out stay
[1:38:11] focused 50 years ago 80% of us adults
[1:38:14] were
[1:38:15] Christian 2007
[1:38:20] 78% yeah 2001 63
[1:38:24] % you know what brought this on I tell
[1:38:26] you what brought this message it was me
[1:38:28] I was I I got curious I
[1:38:30] thought I'm going to see how many
[1:38:32] Christians there are in the United
[1:38:34] States of America because based on the
[1:38:36] number of population there's no way
[1:38:38] Donald Trump can
[1:38:42] lose if there's 260 M billion or what
[1:38:46] million whatever the number is
[1:38:48] Christians well Lord have mercy he'll
[1:38:51] the country
[1:38:53] but we have to make sure those are Holy
[1:38:55] Ghost
[1:39:01] filled
[1:39:04] well so the population of Christianity
[1:39:07] begins to decline reaching 47% by
[1:39:11] mid-century and by and by 2070 should we
[1:39:16] T that long by 2070 37%
[1:39:24] from the 40s to 20 2070 a decline from
[1:39:28] 95% to
[1:39:30] 37% is expected you see Christians are
[1:39:32] fixing to be a minority if you think you
[1:39:35] under pressure
[1:39:37] now you see what I'm saying I can't you
[1:39:39] can't you cannot dispute prophecy you
[1:39:42] cannot dispute
[1:39:44] statistics you can't dispute what's
[1:39:46] happening in our country and he says now
[1:39:49] she must rot
[1:39:55] H he's talking about the country he's
[1:39:57] talking about the United States the
[1:39:59] country he says she must rot notice
[1:40:02] notice Brethren she's totally rotten her
[1:40:05] Politics the system is rotten it's just
[1:40:07] as rotten as it can be there isn't a
[1:40:09] sound bone in her in her World Systems
[1:40:12] in her politics in her religious uh
[1:40:15] politics whatever it is you say well I'm
[1:40:18] a Democrat I'm a republican I'm a
[1:40:19] Methodist I'm a Baptist the whole thing
[1:40:22] is gotten to the core do you see why
[1:40:25] it's important you don't denominational
[1:40:27] IE
[1:40:28] anything do you see why that's so
[1:40:30] important that we don't make a
[1:40:31] denomination around the word of God but
[1:40:33] that we just simply live the word of
[1:40:35] God when somebody ask what do y'all
[1:40:37] believe we believe the word of
[1:40:40] God well what part all of
[1:40:48] it he says this thing is rotten to the
[1:40:51] entire core there's got to be something
[1:40:53] give way she can't
[1:40:56] stand this is the mind of Christ
[1:41:00] speaking are you with me listen to this
[1:41:03] you say man I I still think we got hope
[1:41:05] I still think we got Co hope and Donald
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:10] Trump you could put a George Washington
[1:41:12] and an Abraham Lincoln in every County
[1:41:14] in this United States and she still
[1:41:17] couldn't come
[1:41:19] back she is beyond Redemption amen
[1:41:26] there's only one thing that can help her
[1:41:27] and that's the coming of the
[1:41:33] Creator as we as we journey through here
[1:41:35] and we begin to walk I got to thinking
[1:41:37] how true that is as we're walking and we
[1:41:39] see the hands of our loving Savior and
[1:41:42] he's saying come my bride come my bride
[1:41:46] no more no more pressure no more toils
[1:41:49] no more troubles no more trials No More
[1:41:51] Tears no more sickness no no more
[1:41:54] heartache Jesus no more worrying where
[1:41:57] you're going to eat no more worrying
[1:41:58] where you're going to sleep no more
[1:41:59] worrying if you're going to have
[1:42:01] clothes no more worrying about all these
[1:42:04] things no more worrying about your
[1:42:05] children making the right
[1:42:07] decisions praise the Lord
[1:42:10] [Applause]
[1:42:23] listen to
[1:42:24] this brother the lids come off of
[1:42:29] Hell the streams of demon powers is
[1:42:32] pouring in from everywhere it's
[1:42:34] Conquering the Nations it's conquered
[1:42:35] politics it's rotten to the court it's
[1:42:37] conquered the churches until they know
[1:42:39] nothing but
[1:42:44] denominations what we need in this hour
[1:42:47] is
[1:42:49] faith we need faith that will produce
[1:42:51] the quickening power through through the
[1:42:53] Holy Ghost a faith that will produce the
[1:42:56] quickening changing power where God can
[1:42:58] come in and move on the scene and in the
[1:43:00] moment in the twinkling of an eye change
[1:43:02] takes
[1:43:04] place turn with me to Hebrews chapter
[1:43:07] 11 Carson if you can pull that up and
[1:43:10] we'll also go into
[1:43:11] Genesis if you if you're quick enough
[1:43:14] we'll see if you're quick on the finger
[1:43:15] quick draw back
[1:43:17] there Hebrews chapter 11 familiar
[1:43:20] scriptures we're very familiar with it
[1:43:24] now
[1:43:26] Faith now Faith is the substance of
[1:43:29] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[1:43:30] Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[1:43:34] good report through faith we understand
[1:43:37] that the worlds were framed by what the
[1:43:40] word of God the worlds just think about
[1:43:43] that all
[1:43:44] countries all all all citizens All
[1:43:47] Nations all continents were framed by
[1:43:51] the word of God so when they step away
[1:43:53] from the word of God what happens to
[1:43:54] their
[1:43:57] framework through faith we understand
[1:43:59] that the worlds are framed by the word
[1:44:01] of God so that things that are seen were
[1:44:03] not made by things which do appear by
[1:44:05] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:44:07] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[1:44:10] he obtained witness that he was
[1:44:11] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[1:44:14] and by it being dead yet speaketh now
[1:44:17] here's where I want to get to by faith
[1:44:20] Enoch was translated
[1:44:22] [Applause]
[1:44:24] that he should not see what
[1:44:27] death and was not found because God had
[1:44:30] translated him can you imagine on that
[1:44:33] day when they're walking around they're
[1:44:34] looking around they say where old Enoch
[1:44:36] go I don't know I've looked everywhere
[1:44:37] for him did you go look at the did you
[1:44:40] go look at the at the Undertaker did you
[1:44:41] go to the funeral home he ain't
[1:44:46] there where'd he go where did he
[1:44:50] go in the moment in the twinkling of an
[1:44:52] ey he was translated God translated him
[1:44:55] for before his translation he had this
[1:44:58] testimony oh we better read this we
[1:45:01] better read this he pleased
[1:45:10] God he pleased
[1:45:14] God but without faith it is
[1:45:20] impossible let me read you a quote real
[1:45:22] quick
[1:45:24] listen he said 'I going to say something
[1:45:26] faith is
[1:45:29] unconscious he said yeah amen you
[1:45:31] believe that yes he said I've learned it
[1:45:33] in the years of travel around the world
[1:45:35] and meeting the people of the different
[1:45:36] walks but faith is
[1:45:39] unconscious you say how are we going to
[1:45:41] make it how are we going to make it how
[1:45:44] how did Enoch make it how are we going
[1:45:46] to make it when we see destruction all
[1:45:48] around us let me finish the
[1:45:50] quote you got faith and don't even know
[1:45:56] it so when you're downhearted when
[1:45:59] you're broken heart and you're depressed
[1:46:01] and you think oh I don't even know how
[1:46:02] we can make it through this world with
[1:46:04] the destruction with the the things that
[1:46:06] are coming upon how am I going to do it
[1:46:08] you've got faith that you don't even
[1:46:09] know you
[1:46:12] got because he says without faith it is
[1:46:15] impossible to please
[1:46:17] him the word says for he that cometh to
[1:46:20] God must believe that he is and that he
[1:46:22] is a reward of them that diligently seek
[1:46:25] Him Genesis chapter
[1:46:30] 5 genesis chapter
[1:46:34] 5 now we're going to get into looking at
[1:46:36] Enoch here for just a few
[1:46:38] minutes because I sometimes I think we
[1:46:41] get in such a hurry that we don't take
[1:46:43] time to realize what's really happening
[1:46:45] and and the timelines of the Bible and
[1:46:47] how all this is lining up and Enoch and
[1:46:49] who he was and because in Genesis
[1:46:51] chapter 5 this is a chapter we all skip
[1:46:53] when we read our Bible this one begat
[1:46:55] this one begat this one begat this one
[1:46:57] begat this begat begat begat beat beat
[1:46:59] beat man is this thing on stuck as it
[1:47:01] burn hit the you know hit the the
[1:47:04] turntable beat beat beat beat but we
[1:47:08] can't miss what happens here Genesis
[1:47:11] 5:21 Enoch lived 6 and5 years and begat
[1:47:16] methusa and Enoch walked with God after
[1:47:19] he begat methusa 300 years and begat
[1:47:22] sons and daughters and all the days of
[1:47:24] Enoch were
[1:47:25] 365 years and Enoch walked with God and
[1:47:30] he was not for God took him so you mean
[1:47:33] this happened in Genesis this is written
[1:47:35] about all the way into yeah this is this
[1:47:38] is the way it works God don't
[1:47:41] change and methusa lived 187 years and
[1:47:46] begat lamech and methusa lived after he
[1:47:48] begat lamech
[1:47:50] 782 years and begat sons and daughter
[1:47:52] daughers all the days of Methuselah were
[1:47:56] 969 years and he
[1:47:59] died so here's where we got to get to
[1:48:01] thank you Carson so here's what he got
[1:48:02] to get to brothers and sisters Enoch
[1:48:05] walked with God Enoch stayed the course
[1:48:09] Enoch didn't deviate off the course at
[1:48:11] all he lived and walked and breathed and
[1:48:14] everything he done was walking up that
[1:48:15] King's
[1:48:16] Highway and he stayed right there you
[1:48:19] say well it wasn't the same as it was
[1:48:21] back then as it is today is so much
[1:48:24] harder was
[1:48:27] it was it because do do we realize do do
[1:48:30] we really realize because I didn't until
[1:48:32] I studied this out exactly what was
[1:48:34] going on during this time listen here
[1:48:38] the Bible tells us nothing about the
[1:48:39] early years of Enoch all that we know is
[1:48:42] by the age of 65 he became the father of
[1:48:45] a child which he named
[1:48:48] methusa right so and we're told that he
[1:48:51] walked with God for over 300 years but I
[1:48:54] want you to notice the name of this
[1:48:56] child methusa if I say methusa you think
[1:48:58] what he's older than methusa right
[1:49:01] that's what you
[1:49:04] think but let's look at what the name
[1:49:06] really means you want to know what time
[1:49:09] this was what time what what Enoch was
[1:49:11] going through what Enoch saw as a
[1:49:13] prophet listen what he saw the name
[1:49:16] methusa means when he is gone it will
[1:49:21] come what's he talking about what's he
[1:49:24] talking about he'll come what what what
[1:49:27] why did he name why did God lay it on
[1:49:28] his heart to name him methusa that when
[1:49:31] he is gone it will come well if you do
[1:49:34] the math and you go looking at all the
[1:49:35] days and the time that everything
[1:49:37] happened in methusa life when you get to
[1:49:39] looking at that you'll find out you do
[1:49:41] the math that the flood in Genesis
[1:49:43] chapter 6 and 8 came soon as mathusla
[1:49:49] died and you going to tell me they
[1:49:51] wasn't having bad times
[1:49:53] because I think there's a reason God
[1:49:54] destroyed the Earth with
[1:49:58] water and Enoch preached this through
[1:50:00] the through the very name of his son you
[1:50:03] see there's a reason that God puts these
[1:50:05] people in place and here he is he's
[1:50:07] telling them at the death of Enoch Enoch
[1:50:09] knew that the world was going to be
[1:50:15] destroyed back to
[1:50:17] Enoch Enoch's name means dedicated one
[1:50:24] I hope that's what my name
[1:50:28] means dedicated one and he lived up to
[1:50:32] that name because when we begin to look
[1:50:34] at the life of Enoch we see that for
[1:50:35] over 300 years on a daily basis day
[1:50:39] after day after day he pleased God he
[1:50:42] was a man that walked with God he was
[1:50:44] intimate with God he knew God God in him
[1:50:46] walked hand in hand side by side over
[1:50:49] and
[1:50:50] over than you Lord
[1:50:54] and he soared in God God began to pull
[1:50:58] him up to a higher place and nothing
[1:51:00] could separate him from God not money
[1:51:03] not
[1:51:05] business not
[1:51:07] possessions not
[1:51:09] pleasure there was not anything in the
[1:51:11] world he was never
[1:51:14] alone and without
[1:51:19] God 365
[1:51:23] years nothing separated
[1:51:26] him because nothing separated him this
[1:51:29] enabled uh Eno to sort of heights that
[1:51:31] only we can imagine and
[1:51:35] dream Enoch was there his faith Ena him
[1:51:39] Enoch's life teaches us that how to walk
[1:51:42] with God in a fallen
[1:51:45] World God was fixing to destroy the
[1:51:48] world so we know that it was in bad
[1:51:50] shape but here's Enoch and Enoch he he
[1:51:53] lived a life that was so pleasing to God
[1:51:55] they walked side by side and he kept
[1:51:58] right there clung to the side of God now
[1:52:00] how many of us can say when we go
[1:52:01] through our daily walk our daily lives
[1:52:03] and right here clung to our side is God
[1:52:05] everywhere we go everything you do
[1:52:07] Michael John God is right there every
[1:52:09] single thing you
[1:52:11] do this man was incredible his passion
[1:52:15] his dedication his desire to serve God
[1:52:17] was beyond anything that we can
[1:52:19] imagine Flawless for 300 years I do good
[1:52:24] sometimes to make it through 30
[1:52:28] minutes well I'm
[1:52:33] honest and Enoch walked with
[1:52:36] God and as he walked with
[1:52:41] God it didn't not just only draw him
[1:52:44] closer to
[1:52:45] Heaven as he walked towards the
[1:52:48] heavenlies he be to distance himself
[1:52:51] from the world
[1:52:53] you see what's
[1:52:54] happening the closer we start to get to
[1:52:57] the seeing seeing the bright lights as
[1:52:59] closer as we get to the last day we
[1:53:01] ought to just keep focusing more and
[1:53:02] more and more on what's ahead and start
[1:53:05] letting the world stay behind us put all
[1:53:08] the world and the draw and the filth
[1:53:11] behind
[1:53:18] us the prophet said he was an eagle for
[1:53:20] that day
[1:53:23] he had his eyes set on a Heavenly up
[1:53:25] above he was an eagle he had Eagle
[1:53:27] Vision now I want you to listen to this
[1:53:29] about Eagle
[1:53:30] Vision Enoch paid attention to the fine
[1:53:34] details he didn't want nothing to slip
[1:53:37] by sometimes we just we just look at the
[1:53:39] big stuff well they don't do this they
[1:53:41] don't do that but what are you
[1:53:43] doing what about your fine
[1:53:46] details how how tuned in is your vision
[1:53:52] he has an he was an
[1:53:54] eagle you know a eagle can spot a rabbit
[1:53:57] from three
[1:54:00] miles yeah there's a different kind of
[1:54:03] vision they have Eagles see things
[1:54:09] different you say well that's that's
[1:54:11] three miles I mean my goodness let me
[1:54:13] put that in
[1:54:15] perspective a mile is 5,280
[1:54:18] feet so at 16,000 feet roughly they can
[1:54:23] see a
[1:54:24] rabbit let's break that on down a little
[1:54:26] bit more when you fly in an airplane you
[1:54:28] know when you start going up and you
[1:54:29] start seeing those cars disappear you're
[1:54:32] probably around 15 to 20,000
[1:54:35] ft so from that range and they're
[1:54:37] soaring there and they're fly they're
[1:54:39] looking down there and they're seeing a
[1:54:43] rabbit Eagles can see farther and Beyond
[1:54:46] than anything there is Eagles can go far
[1:54:49] far far way more farther than than what
[1:54:52] well we
[1:54:54] can't Paul you help me oh yeah here we
[1:54:57] go come
[1:54:59] on come here D help me too yeah so you
[1:55:03] hold this right here here let's get down

[1:56:08] right here oh yeah do you see the
[1:56:10] difference we gotta we can't keep our
[1:56:13] eyes just just honed in on one little
[1:56:15] thing we gotta be able to look and be a
[1:56:17] to see beyond thank you thank you
[1:56:18] brother Paul we got to be able to see
[1:56:20] beyond what's happening around around us
[1:56:22] and look further to the spiritual and
[1:56:24] say God is moving something's happening
[1:56:26] God keep showing me show me more show me
[1:56:29] more show me
[1:56:30] [Applause]
[1:56:36] more he says I was talking to a dear
[1:56:39] brother sitting there the other
[1:56:41] day and he said one thing brother
[1:56:43] brandham was always shook me I said what
[1:56:45] is it brother he said it he said here is
[1:56:48] what you said and it's true the minority
[1:56:51] how a little group is going to be saved
[1:56:53] in the days of the coming and we talked
[1:56:55] of how Jesus straight As the gate and
[1:56:57] arrows away but few there will be that
[1:56:59] will find
[1:57:02] it you know some people are so
[1:57:06] narrow-minded they could see through a
[1:57:08] keyho with both
[1:57:12] eyes you got
[1:57:16] it they don't want to look beyond what
[1:57:20] they see in front of them
[1:57:23] and he says you know he say straight As
[1:57:24] the gate and narrow as the way he said
[1:57:26] but he said as it was in the days of
[1:57:28] Noah where eight Souls were saved by
[1:57:30] water so shall it be in the coming and
[1:57:33] he said and I said brother you just he
[1:57:34] said remember there's only eight Souls
[1:57:36] there he said you got half the
[1:57:41] picture he said Noah was a type of the
[1:57:44] remnant that was carried over not the
[1:57:46] translated
[1:57:48] Bunch I'm not going in an ark
[1:57:54] I'm going like a
[1:57:58] thought Enoch was translated right
[1:58:00] before the floods he was a Rapture he
[1:58:04] was a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:58:06] that was raptured before the flood
[1:58:09] hardships can come it's okay let the
[1:58:12] hardships come because it it's not going
[1:58:14] to get too hard for the Bride of Jesus
[1:58:16] Christ she's going to take a Rapture
[1:58:18] she's going to take a translation like
[1:58:20] Enoch he said there there was Enoch one
[1:58:22] day just walking along and all of a
[1:58:24] sudden a ladder just FL fell out of
[1:58:26] Heaven he just walked right on up the
[1:58:31] ladder we either Believe It Or we
[1:58:36] don't so no matter what we just got to
[1:58:38] keep walking keep walking Jesus Christ
[1:58:43] no matter he says if it was a storm and
[1:58:45] the Gale was knocking from the boat from
[1:58:46] both sides of the other he was standing
[1:58:48] in his face and a mess of demons at him
[1:58:50] if they were hanging everywhere he never
[1:58:55] moved he didn't fear the things of this
[1:58:57] world because why he's not of this world
[1:59:01] and what about the Bride of of Jesus
[1:59:02] Christ she's not of this world either so
[1:59:05] don't fear the things of this world he
[1:59:08] said it never mooved he walked right on
[1:59:10] just as calm and quiet as could be you
[1:59:13] ever seen people get all worked up and
[1:59:15] been out of shape over this the minutest
[1:59:17] of
[1:59:18] things I said man don't sweat the small
[1:59:21] stuff
[1:59:23] there bigger things that can happen
[1:59:25] we're still alive we still we still
[1:59:29] full we still have our
[1:59:38] homes just walk he says unconscious of
[1:59:41] fear walk unconscious of criticism walk
[1:59:44] unconscious unto the world walk as
[1:59:46] you're in Christ walk with him not
[1:59:48] paying any attention to the right or the
[1:59:50] left hand just keep keep on moving if
