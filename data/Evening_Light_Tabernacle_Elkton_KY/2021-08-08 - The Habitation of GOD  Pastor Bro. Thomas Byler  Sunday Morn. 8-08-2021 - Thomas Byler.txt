uh foreign um god foreign you first well so um you [Music] you foreign [Music] so foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign so [Music] [Music] okay morning brothers and sisters if we'll just stand this morning brother brad will open us in prayer this morning is foreign amen the children can be dismissed for sunday school if we'll turn in the scripture uh to psalms we're gonna go back to psalms 119. psalms 119 and we're going to start with verse 17 and we're going to read verse 32 deal bountifully with thy servant that i may live and keep thy word i am a stranger in the earth hide not thy commandments from me thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed which do air from thy commandments princes also did sit and speak against me but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes my soul cleaveth unto the dust quickened thou me according to thy word make me to understand the way of thy precepts so shall i talk to of thy wondrous works remove me from remove from me the way of lying and grant me thy law graciously i have stuck unto thy testimonies o lord put me not to shame i will run the way of thy commandments when thou shalt charge my heart god bless you may be seated brother brian for adult sunday school morning brothers and sisters as we go through the 119th psalm there i don't know if you all know that but that's actually the hebrew apple that as you're going through from the start to the end also their language is a lot different than ours the semantic language words is or totally different than ours grammar everything so if you would challenge me to romans the fourth chapter i was listening to that uh reading that uh devotional this morning brother branham was talking about i'll just read a couple of these verses it says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable because you're a reasonable servant so paul is saying here no matter what our circumstances whatever state we're at or where we're whatever is going on that's your reasonable service to present yourself before the living god and to present your sacrifices before the living god no matter what the world is doing to you out there you still have an obligation as a christian to serve your lord and it goes on say and be not conformed to the world but be transformed by the renewing of your minds that you may prove what is good and acceptable in the perfect will of god and it's really hard to fulfill the second scripture if you're number one if you're not doing the abcs like brother brown taught you always believe christ and also read your bible and pray every day it's going to be a hard thing for you to do the second verse here and he goes on to say for i say through grace given unto me to every man that among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god has dealt to every man the measure of faith and that really speaks to our age that we're in you know a lot of times people think more of themselves than they really are you know you know my old profession you know i used to you know i say it a lot you know people have that disease of self-importance they think that more important than they really are in the scheme of things it's a heart disease once you it possesses you that you think without you nothing's going to work or nothing's going to be successful unless you've got your hands in it but that's not how a christian is you know that it's god's will in god's hand that guides everything um but that devotional i was reading this morning brother branham was talking about he was talking about the scripture transforming and you know he used to work as a lineman in an electrical company you know i do that every day deal with all kinds of different types of electrical parts when you know the thing about a transformer it has no moving parts there's nothing moving in that transformer but it takes a voltage from one state and moves it to another state whether it's higher or lower but i was just thinking this morning the truth about it is everything electrical you you gotta have something first before anything else will work and you've got to have the source you have to have the power or the energy to make it work and that's in anything we do in life if you don't have the power of jesus christ in your heart and life if you don't have the power of the gospel in you none of this is going to work you can try and try and try it's not going to work unless you got the baptism of the holy ghost and god has possessed your vessel it's not going to work not to say that you shouldn't strive to try i would never tell someone not to try i mean that's that's a bad spirit well you know you hear a lot of people saying well you're not going to be there so don't worry about it no i always encourage people to try to change as best they can but god when he gets on a hold of you and he changes you you know that god's done it for you we all come from different circumstances different places in life we're all raised in so most of you are from this state some of you come from other states and other places you know you all have your family groups you're from you're all raised different but the thing about being a christian all that goes to the wayside and when god makes you something then it's what god did for you not where you came from that matters and i'll just read a few more of these scriptures here you know the brother asked me this morning i'll be honest when i came to church this morning i was blank you know sometimes it's that way you can you can pray and you can read your bible for an hour sometimes and you don't have a clear concise thought that you want to express but the thing about whatever you do for the lord you've got to be willing to yield your vessel you got to be willing to just put your mind away and let god have his way in whatever you're doing in any circumstances whether it's at work whether when you come here whatever when you're dealing with issues in your family you've just got to be willing sometimes to be quiet enough to see what god's going to speak to you in any given situation and let me finish start with this third verse for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according to god hath dwelt every man the measure of faith soberly you know you could spend a long time just talking about that world it goes back to these seven virtues behind me so being sober that's something this world doesn't have be sober that everything you do every time you think of thought or you're about to engage in another type of thing that soberly you consider it in prayer and reading of your bible to make sure you're doing the right thing he goes on to say in the fourth verse for as we have had many members in one body and all members have not the same office and that's being brutally honest here we're all not the same god raises us up to do different things should you be jealous of another man or another woman because god has raised him up to do something different no but you just got to accept the fact that everyone has a different purpose and a different office that they're going to fill having gifts differing according to grace has given us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to uh here's my pronunciation of our faith or ministers let us wait on our ministering for he that teaches on teaching that goes to what paul started with in the first couple of verses again you have to be willing to yield and wait for god to give you the green light or to open the door for you to do something and then he goes i don't want to re or he that exhorts exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruth with diligently he that show with mercy cheerful cheerfulness you know that's when you know you have to show mercy that's a that's a hard thing to be cheerful about it you know you have to do the right thing and be cheerful about doing the right thing even though it might tear you apart when you're doing it but that's what the bible says sometimes you've got to make decisions where god is leading you to do something whether that's humbling yourself realizing you made a mistake or giving the other guy an advantage knowing that you're giving them an advantage you got to do it cheerfully you don't do it cheerfully it doesn't make a difference and he goes on say let love be without this simulation but poor that which is evil cleave that which is good and really for the day we're living that's really important yeah as you see things going just going crazy just let you know that you need to cling to christ even more and he goes on be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another not thoughtful in in business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in hope patient and tribulation continuing instant in prayer you know these goes back to what brother branham taught us about your abcs you know you have to do them do you do it out of uh if here's the difference you either do it out of love or you do it out of law and everyone has that where you have to say are you doing it out of love or are you doing it because you think you need to do it and he goes on rejoicing in hope patient and tribulation continuing instant and prayer distributing to the necessities of the same given to hospitality bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that you rejoice weep with them that we basically paul is talking here about just simple christian compassion for your brothers and sisters be of the same mind one toward another but not mind high things but condescended to men of low estate be not wise and you know this goes back i'm stopping in the middle of this verse it goes back to the second or first chapter of james's verse right here and you can see the bible is all intertwined together you know all the teachings in the bible you can find where you see paul say something you can see james or peter say the same thing and he goes on to say recompense no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men and if it be possible as such as lieth and you live peaceably with all men that's a goal for any christian as as much as people try to riley up you want to live at peace with them and it goes on to say dearly beloved eventually not yourself but rather get placed around for it is what written vengeance is mine and i will replace saith the lord therefore if thy enemy hunger feed him if he thirsts give him a drink for in so doing god shall he calls a fire upon his head and he that overcometh evil both overcome evil with good and like i said i come here flank this morning but the one thing i believe you you can't read god's word enough you know uh moses told the priests in his you know most people couldn't read and write in moses's state you know even 150 years ago even 50 years ago even in our old country knowing a lot of people couldn't read god's word they had to hear it from the preacher or hear from someone that could read it to him and but the thing moses told the priests is they were constantly supposed to throw the word of god upon the hearts and upon the minds of the people that was one of their obligation as priests they were constantly supposed to read the word of god and present the word of god to the people so they would fulfill it and it comes to us in our age as christians that can read and write and can reap what god has to say you know we don't have an excuse the closer you stay to god's word the closer you stay to him brother david am i with all your heart this morning understand if we could this morning and sing a little course i love you lord and i lift my voice if we could this morning it's good to see each and everyone out this morning god bless you good to have our visitors emma and brother bo god bless you this morning it's good to have y'all with us this morning [Music] i love you lord [Music] oh my soul [Music] read your take joy [Music] in what you hear let it be a sweet sweet sound in your ear once again to aim this morning [Music] oh love you lord yes i do [Music] and i lift my voice [Applause] [Music] take joy [Music] let it be a sweet [Music] sweet sounds in your ear [Music] amen well i started out traveling for the lord many years ago [Music] [Music] and then i would say i wouldn't take nothing for my [Music] i journey take nothing for my journey now gotta make it to heaven somehow though the devil didn't spit tries to turn me around [Music] he's offered everything that's got a name all the wealth i want the world and fame if i could steal a good thing nothing for my journey now [Music] well there's nothing in the world that could ever take the place of god's love [Music] [Applause] all the silver and gold cause he's my mighty touch from above when the soul needs him i begin to feel his fireworks and i said thank the lord i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now [Music] well i wouldn't take for nothing for my journey now i gotta make it to heaven sometimes though the devil gives me tries to turn you around oh he's offered everything that's got a name all the way up i want the world

got a name of the wealth i [Music] is that how you feel in your heart this morning god bless you it's like we said good to have each and everyone here this morning and amen and those that are watching online god bless you this morning you man you know i i read something this morning and i guess i'm kind of like brother brian this morning when i was praying the songs it seemed and now the way i felt like going it's going a little different but that's okay too and but branham said if you're a christian you love to go where other christians are and fellowship with other christians so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life you can't do it because it's like i'm hungry but you never go to the table i never eat or i just ain't gonna do it see you've got to go and feed on the word of god and fellowship with one another and that's our heart's desire and this song come on my mind this morning since i've been here this morning god's wonderful people i love the thrill that i feel when i get together with god's wonderful people and you know sometimes we struggle we battle just to get to the house of the lord but you know there's a reason why because the enemy doesn't want you to feed this morning he doesn't want you to praise the lord he doesn't want you to worship in spirit and truth this morning he wants you to feel beat down and feel like you're nobody but guess what you are somebody this morning you're a child of the king this morning and amen i love the thrill that i feel this morning amen i love the thrill that i feel when i get together with god's wonderful people i love [Music] [Applause] just to see all the happy faces praising god in heavenly places what a thrill that it feels when i get together with [Music] what god is love before when we need in one article and we lift our mercy is what i got oh there's no place i'd rather be than with the ones who've been set free i'm so glad i met god's great big family god's wonderful people i love the thrill that i feel when praising god in heavenly just what a thrill that'll be till i get together with god [Music] it can be just anywhere to our three are gathered that the spirit of the lord will be there too oh yes oh there's no fellowship so sweet there's no thrill that came with the real life whenever god's [Music] god's wonderful people love [Applause] [Music] praising god [Music] on that great reunion day and on that great union when our lord says come on and the saints from heaven [Music] this will be the greatest i love the [Music] faces praising god heavenly place is what a thrill that'll do when i get together with god [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh this will be the greatest [Music] god's wonderful people [Music] wonderful people we're not outside just to see heavenly place is hey man you love him this morning thank you lord amen how we love you amen when the redeemed are gathered in this morning let's sing that if we could amen you may be seated god bless you this morning and sing very good anyways and it seems like sometimes i i want to just have you keep standing and i know that's not good because everyone gets tired and i don't get tired i'm just thankful for his grace and mercy this one i shouldn't say i don't get tired sometimes i do that wasn't true but we want to do our best this morning and amen when redeemed or gathered my what a day that'll be

musicians amen and a nice warm summer day to everybody this morning amen praise the lord good to see everybody this morning amen praise the lord it's just good to be in the house of the lord can't think of any announcements amen i think we have three more sundays the fourth sunday will be our youth meetings amen so we've got about a month away so amen we'll try to keep praying that the lord have his way amen let's bow our heads this morning kind heavenly father we come before you lord once again assembling ourselves together lord as he told us to do in your precious name father we come asking god that you'll just bless every effort of each one lord and father we're so grateful to serve an awesome god like you father lord when the storms are truly raging outside lord jesus and the world is falling apart get our anchor holds within the veil lord we're so appreciative all your goodness lord and we ask god you'd help me lord just to get out of the way now so that you could speak to your people the things that you once said lord jesus and help me not to say anything in myself or in the flesh but just what you want to speak is what we want to hear lord and we ask god that you would help father the congregation this morning to pull on the gift lord of god lord jesus and that the cups may be lord held up high lord desiring father that it might be filled to overflowing we ask lord your blessing upon the reading of the word the meditation of our heart now in jesus christ's name amen amen so it's good to be in the house of the lord amen amen good to have brother bo is it amen god bless you brother bo amen i don't know if i've seen you before or not probably have but anyway amen it is good to have emma sister emma with us this morning to you so and god bless you amen praise the lord so it's just good to be in the house of the lord amen so amen we're just going to take a little thought i feel like the lord's laid on my heart to speak i was studying last week and i ran across this and i was kind of leaning that way and but then the on the other hand i just stayed with what we had there and i felt went with what i felt like the lord wanted us to have last week and then so this week we're going to turn if you will to the book of ephesians we'll turn to the book of ephesians and we're going to do a bit of reading in the book of ephesians this morning certainly a thought we want to try to pick up that paul had and expressed and for some reason the last couple three services has been has to do with the holy spirit or christ being in us amen and so as we spoke wednesday about how that we serve one another we serve god because amen and it doesn't fall in the category of serving man amen because we don't serve man but serving man is to serve a man's will outside of god's will that's serving man amen but to serve god's people by the holy spirit that's serving god amen as you serve one another you serve god we seen in judgment there wednesday night how that the sheep and the goats were separated and so forth and and both of them were either blessed or condemned because of how they treated god's people because god was in his people the least of these as you have done unto these the least of these mine children you have done it unto me amen so we know that as we treat each other as we treat god's people amen that's how we treat god amen in that right so be careful how you treat folks amen because amen if you are mean god's people remember you're being mean to god so and that's not going to be looked over so well so praise the lord i just love that thought the lord gave us and that was found and last sunday we touched on ephesians the second chapter amen and i'll just touch on it and verse 14 chapter 2 verse 14 he says for he is our peace he is our peace who has made both one and has broken down that middle wall of partition between us amen talked about god amen abolishing petitions in that right and divisions and walls and barriers amen so now we want to go down a little bit further and let's uh go down to verse 16 through 22 and this is what we'll speak on for a while this morning all right verse 16 that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and in them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and now notice here we go we go to talking about building a building from here on out talking about building a building and are built upon the foundation upon of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone amen how many believes god is building a building now notice in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into an holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are build it together for inhabitation of god through the spirit amen this morning's title is going to be a habitation for god amen so god bless this reading of the word you can be seated this morning praise be to god how many believe that god is a builder god is a builder he is a wise master builder amen i i've done carpentry work many years myself amen and i know what it's like to build and i know what it's like to have to tear down and to redo and and so forth and every every carpenter i believe has a reciprocating saw amen amen because that reciprocating sauce for the most part is to tear out what you did wrong amen and so but that's not how it is with god god don't need no reciprocating salt he doesn't need to redo anything because he knows how to do it perfect the first time amen and i'm glad for that so we know that god is in the building business amen i believe he said in saint john 13 to 14 i'm thinking maybe it was 14 where he says you know i go to prepare a place for you amen and i believe in the future home but says that jesus christ is presently over there amen and that he is building the future home amen of uh amen for us for the bride building our future home amen and so i can't imagine what it would be like now how many knows he took either i don't know which it was to be honest with you i don't know if it was uh one week or if it was 6 000 years that god took to build the earth isn't that right amen it talks about six days and so forth and then all the way to the sixth day he built this that or the other seventh day he rested amen but at any rate whether it was six days or six thousand years because the bible does say that one year is with him as a thousand years or one day is with him is a thousand years isn't it not one year but anyway so we know that he's been gone now for about what uh the lord's been working amen for a couple of thousand years you can only imagine what god can get done in that time frame amen so we know that we have something on the other side that's going to be something amen that we can't imagine amen like paul said it's not entered the heart of man the things that god has prepared for them that love him amen but he is getting a place ready for us and he is building that place over there how maybe he's going to have streets of gold walls of jasper and so forth i mean there's going to be houses and avenues and there's going to be oh man a river flowing down through the midst of it all and all of these things that you can only imagine god is building amen but can we say this morning would it be okay to say this morning amen that the streets are empty the houses are empty huh i think it'll be okay to say because how many knows he is building that for you and me amen and so you know he's getting it all ready on that side he's getting everything ready everything built just to our take and on this side he's getting another portion ready he's doing some building over here too so i don't know about you but a god is a very busy man and amen he's very busy and he's got a lot going and but you know i i can't you just blow your mind if you try to figure out how god can do all this but he can because he's god he's awesome he meant he's over here on this side and he's doing the work also and he's building something he has a purpose and he has a plan amen now to the world it is a mystery right to the world what god is up to is a mystery you know i can't figure it out they don't know what it's all about oh my but aren't you thankful that you know because listen the bible says that when he wrote which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places he said in far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but that which is to come so how many believes that creases christ at this present time is above every power above every dominion that there is he's above it all and he's got the highest name that there ever was named amen not only in this world but also in that which is to come and has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness amen that of him that filleth all and in all praise the lord then in chapter one of ephesians verse uh eight will go and read that listen he says wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will praise be to god aren't you glad this morning that you understand what it's all about oh my there is nothing like having clarity of mine amen having a clear mind understanding something perfectly it is rather illuminating amen because if you're confused and don't know and don't understand it's a terrible place to be and that's where the world is they don't understand they don't they just don't comprehend it they don't know what it's all about amen but i'm here to tell you there's only two factions in the world there's two programs in the world the one program is god's program the other one is the devil's program amen we belong to one program or the other and if you truly believe to the program that i want to help you by the grace of god this morning to get you to understand that if you have the revelation that you are part of god's program when you truly get understanding of who you really are the prophet said the rapture will take place [Music] amen oh my all right let's go home praise the lord if you understand who you are you can just go home and be happy for the whole week can we get back sunday again amen it's the greatest joy that in the world if you can understand what in the world you're here for who you really are here which side you long on where you belong and then you can put that foundation down and nothing can shake you though the storm's rage nothing can shake you amen praise the lord just go with the spirit here because jesus said a wise man what he built his house upon a rock and that right he built his house upon iraq amen the winds blew the storm games amen the streams and luke he said the streams beat me eminently against that house but it stood because he had founded his house upon the rock amen oh my that's what you got to do first the foundation amended peter i mean ephesians said he says that jesus christ is what the chief cornerstone that's what all the house leans on is that chief cornerstone he is the very foundation the chief cornerstone praise be to god he made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together gathered together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are in earth even in him amen praise be to god it's part of the things of christ are in the earth the dust of the earth isn't that right back to adams they burned them they fed them the lions they did all these things but one day god's going to gather those things all together amen everything that is in christ remember they asked brother branham we want to be in the rapture we want to be saved and should we just gather in jefferson jeffersonville should we gather in tucson where you live where should we gather he said just gather in christ the king [Applause] amen you've got to be in christ not in church in christ in the holy ghost that's the only way that you're going to be gathered if you go down to your grave without that quickening power there won't be nothing to raise you back up you got to have that quickening power god is gathering everything together praise be to god i'm going to tell you what the greatest mystery of all is the greatest mystery of all amen praise be to god now notice so he says in whom we also verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated i believe our brother touched on about a few sundays ago being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will he knew everything that would ever happen amen he can he can make it work i like that he works all things perfectly after the counsel of his own will [Music] aren't you glad that it may look like it's complete chaos but it's exactly according to his wealth oh my it's so it's so crazy that can i say as a preacher it's so crazy to think there can be that much chaos out there and yet in the midst of it all and i put it in the midst of it all right it's the perfect will of god there's the perfect will of god in the midst of it all the young folks out there they they went that way they chose to go that way and cause their own chaos they're living in their own way their own world their own bed they're sleeping in their own bed that they've made isn't that right but those that are in the perfect will of god you and i isn't that right amen we're not going by our own making our own doing we're relying on him we have completely surrendered to him and he is our builder how many believes that god is building you we are god's building amen god is building us praise be to god aren't you glad for that oh boy all right so i've got so many scriptures this morning i don't want to stand up here and be confused so he forgive me i want to i want to take and and a few of these i just want to mark them out as i go now that he comes to me let's go to first corinthians talk about we are god's building how many believes that we're god's building i absolutely believe that we are god's building amen all right we're part of his body hold on a minute now let me find this what i'm looking for ah here i go already let me think here and let me look give me a minute would you be patient with me 3 9 [Music] through 17. yes there i got it first corinthians 3 first corinthians 3. here's part of the reason all right three nine let's read this now three for we are laborers together with god ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building amen ye are god's building according to the grace of god which given to me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another man another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth their own amen have you ever heard of the work that's going on in johnson city the work that's going on up in the brother schools or wherever it might be every little church there's a work that's going on right right here there's a work that's going on there's a work that god has given me and we're building on something amen and he says be careful how you build and all right be careful how you build because there's going to come a manifestation of what kind of building you have there's all kinds of uh buildings out there every church out there and you know well god doesn't really care if you do this or you know which way how many gods you believe there is huh doesn't really matter how you baptize whether his father son the holy ghost who jesus doesn't really is that what you're building on huh you know jesus didn't say it doesn't really matter you find mo and find no scripture you'll find where jesus commanded them to do it a certain way commanded them he never said god it doesn't matter that's man people build all kinds of wishy-washy things amen and it's a fire it's gonna burn it it's not gonna stand oh my oh boy i'll tell you what people think that they can just do whatever they wanna they wanna do whatever they wanna do in the name of christianity all kinds of disgrace and everything else and they think that's what kevin's going to be made of that's not what heaven is going to be made of amen let me go on here all right i have laid the foundation another build of them but let every man take he how he buildeth thereon for another foundation can no man lay then that is lage which is jesus christ praise be to god you know as much as we admired our prophet and even he did such signs and wonders and jesus worked through him so much and he's earning the thoughts of the people in the heart and the healing that took place out there until they thought he was jesus but even brother brown says i'm not just nine no better than the sinner that was saved yesterday and in his picture you'll find that he is pointing us to christ every true prophet or messenger or preacher will not point you to their self they will point you to jesus christ you try to get in any other way and you are nothing but a thief and a robber and you're going to be found out and you're going to be said to amen how did you get in here cast them out they'll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth jesus christ is the foundation there's no other foundation than jesus christ even what he did on the cross that is the foundation of every principle of christianity i tell you something in revelation 3 and 14 and talk unto the angels of blasians right this is a faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god amen how many know jesus was the beginning of the creation of god and romans 8 says that he we were predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son that's what god's building god is building sons and daughters god is building and has been building oh a place of habitation a place to habitate your house is where you habitate i right that's your habitation where do you live 2901 green ridge borrowed that's where i live that's where my house is the world can ask jesus christ where do you live where is he gonna say i live in my people i live in my church that is the place of my habitation now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stone wood haze double every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is amen notice if any man's work shall be burnt notice if any man's work abide which he hath built upon he shall be shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer lost but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire i don't know just what that means verse 16 not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you why don't we drink why don't we smoke why don't we cuz why don't we do all this get all kinds of dirt on our hearts and our lives because the next verse says if any man defile the temple of god him shall god save destroy don't defile the temple of god for the temple of god is holy which temple are ye think about it we know that the threefold purpose of god one of them was that god was gonna be above us which was the old testament then he came down and he was gonna dwell with us emmanuel jesus christ in the flesh and then the third was that he was gonna be in his people that's why you can't give a child of god a cup of water but you'll get a reward for it you can't call them stupid but that you'll get a reward for it huh you can't call them nails you can't do anything to them but what you receive a reward for because they are where god dwells amen i think we need to remember this i think that we get so common i believe sometimes we become so common to ourselves that we forget the fact that it's god living in us doing his own good pleasure that you are not your own your bought with a price you're not living your own life you are now god god's now living his life through you everything you do everything you say everything you think should reflect christ oh i love to talk about how that we ought to have a good old shout and praising god worshiping god on this side oh we love them hallelujah gloria times let the glory roll when the roll is called glory but remember one of these days we're gonna walk those streets of golden we're gonna walk up and down on the streets of gold and i'll tell you what we want to walk here the way we're gonna walk on those streets of gold are you with me this morning what kind of life did you live the attitude that you have the spirit that you have the thought pattern that you have is that right is it worthy to walk down those streets but will you just fit in when you're transferred from here to there if you drown drop dead right now we want to be the way that you are why do you say that brother byler i say that because we know that the prophet taught us that death doesn't change you when you die that's what you are death doesn't change you amen so you ask yourself if i died right now is that how you'd want to be if not i hope before next sunday you come back you can say yeah i am where i need to be amen or should i say before next sunday before the service is over let's not push it off that long you might be dead before they get chance amen would you fit there man if you got amongst a bunch of shout and preach and scream and hollering people over there where should be god said oh i'm so glad that the lord brought me out amazing grace how sweet this how much does he really mean to you folks by saying that i realize god is building something everything he is doing he's building and working on you brother david sings that song a lot of time when i preach these things he's still working on me making what i ought to be yeah that's exactly what he's doing i believe he how many believes he's working on you because you are the temple of god and if he isn't inhabiting the way that he should then lord help us to make some more room for him back to ephesians amen how many believes were his body now we've heard all kinds of symbols and things like you know a red horse and a black horse and uh you know scorpions with tails and heads like lions and all kinds of symbolic things in the bible but our our a little bit different symbol is that we are the body of christ and the head is in heaven how many believes that the head is not with us the head is in heaven but this is the body whenever whenever they i don't have a hoffman i don't have a cloud here but how many knows that he says that was the hoffman's head of christ those angels formed the hoffman side of christ and i've seen pictures where you can see the eyes you can see the chin you can see all of that he says that's the head that's your head the thing of it is we still get orders from the head it's not severed it's not disconnected we are connected to the head isn't that right amen through spiritual revelation we're connected to the head but you are the only body that he has how many plays out this morning you are his body even the prophet said the devils don't they can't they can seem english can't do anything unless they got somebody to work through that's the same way with the holy ghost huh everything's just [Music] absolutely nothing without god being in your heart amen these are god's hands these are god's eyes this is god's mind watch what you let to go through it isn't that right amen praise the lord okay so now look let's go uh down to verse 15 of chapter four and then we're gonna go backwards and pick up a couple scriptures before that okay okay four and 16 right here we'll go to that first let's go 15 but speaking the truth in love you may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply of accord according to the effectual working of the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen so we find that the body of christ is to be fitly joined together that's why paul said don't let there be any divisions among you every one of you think the same thing speak the same thing amen because that's how a body is supposed to work so that's how everything's supposed to work the foundation comes to the primitive lord it comes to this it comes to the walls walls everything is that everything is in the place that it ought to be isn't that right notice when he went up into heaven verse 9 going backwards now here he said verse 9 when he ascended what was it but did he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth that he that descended is the same also which ascended up far above the heavens said am feel all things praise be to god i thought about that on the way to church feel all things what would happen if god was to die everything would die then brother bam says the blade of grass they don't even know what makes that grow what makes that life what's the life in that he says that's god in there huh everything with that die because he's the one that keeps everything alive all right and that's what he wants to be in his body he wants to feel all feel everything he wants to feel all things and he gave some apostles prophets some evangelists pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ how many knows that we already know that the body of christ and all the way down to each believer that you are that temple that he's building you are the building of god the body of christ is the building that god is inhabiting and now he's given apostles and prophets and teachers to do what tear out things that aren't supposed to be there because let's admit it this is a house that has to get renovated it has to completely get renovated because we've got all kinds of things in there that needs to be ripped out and it needs to be made brand spanking no amen every time the lord rebukes you every time the lord speaks to you brothers and sisters he is working on you oh i'm so thankful for that aren't you aren't you thankful that god is causing you to grow and to come to completion i believe that we had a man in this generation that came to completion that came to perfection we did i truly believe it amen that god could say that ordinary young couple that's kissing each other all over the place close to the front row just doing it to disturb the whole congregation he said whatever you say to them it'll happen to them huh well we need another anonymize and spy can you imagine no doubt but probably if he said because if you have done this they will pack your bodies out and they drop dead right there it has brought a reverence and the scare and the fear in the church like you ain't never seen lord of mercy people come in here and watch what they even think isn't that right sure but he didn't do that did he he was merciful he was merciful because that's what god is he's merciful and he says i'll tell you what can you imagine older than people god just told me that whatever i tell whatever i say about y'all it'll happen to you no doubt but the holy spirit scared the liver out of them no doubt potato had such a respect man i messed up but when he said i forgive you for that huh i forgive you for that because remember even brother bannon said that elisha i believe it was and the bears he says that was the wrath of man when he cursed them children because they made fun of him and not having any air huh it wasn't christ it was him but god backed him up because that's what he said amen oh my let me just say what's come to my mind when i think about even this church a lot of us folks have known each other for the last 30 years now by the bread been here this october 20th be 30 years when i know you i know y'all y'all know me i'm so grateful i'm thankful that god has caused us to grow up no we're not completely grown yet but we've improved isn't that right we've grown a lot we've learned a lot there's a lot of things that just don't happen anymore things that we don't do anymore because it's childish and it's foolish isn't that right well i'll tell you what brother glenn if i was still doing the same thing i did 15 years ago huh if i couldn't pastor any better than i did about 15 years ago ago i should quit huh you got to grow you got to get better grow up into him amen how many wants to do that see god i want to grow up and i just work on a little bit more amen praise be to god i know i say things that's a little sticky sometimes but i have a right to amen praise the lord you love the lord i like that paul saying the building fitly framed together groweth into a holy temple of the lord and it was just the next chapter that he goes from talking about fitly frame together to coming to perfection through the five-fold ministry that is to help and absolutely help amen how many knows if you don't ever listen to a preacher what are you are you going to get any better no because that's the way god ordained it to be amen until we come into the statue of a perfect man amen you love the lord this morning the beginning of the creation of god now notice let's look at another habitation for a few minutes would you it just came to my mind back there in the con in uh in my studies i was beginning to think about the habitation of god but god has been working to get a place that he can live a place that he's going to live out of his life and that he's going to inhabit and i thought about there's another habitation in order for that to happen in order for god to come and inhabit you and inhabit me how many know there has to be an opening of your heart's door for god to work on you you have to first open your heart before god can ever come into your heart you've got to open it because he said i stand at that door and i knock amen if any man open the door i will come into him and i will sup with him and he with me in other words we'll have fellowship together so there has to be an opening amen if you want more how many can say this morning go with me if you want more of god there has to be a further opening of your hearts door you got to open a little wider you gotta open a little deeper and how do you do that how do you get anywhere is through choice through choice let me ask you this how many knows that how many knows what you're gonna do next week right well this is what i plan on doing tomorrow morning this is what i plan to do it's because of the choice that you make hey you can be at work or you can say i'm going to canada i'm going to somewhere else i'm going here there whatever it might be i'm going to take a vacation you can be wheelchair wherever you want to be and so is it with god when you open up your choice your heart your mind and say i want more of god then guess what you're going to get more of god oh my i've been holding back on saying this but i'm going to go ahead and say it because ultimately this is what i want to try to talk about tarzan a little bit but you know because i've been praying lord draw me closer to you and yeah i've been praying lord talk to me today speak to me today how many ever does that lord speak to me because when we pray let me oh my we go down here and we get in our knees and we say lord jesus pray for my mom my dad my brother my sister god i just bless them bless me today and help me to do everything according to your will and lord do this for me and we go rattling but everybody says we do all the talking most of the time and we don't do the listening we don't do any listening god can't get the word edgewise in prayer is supposed about speaking it's lord i want to thank you and for your goodness wonderful a day you gave me and you know so i was driving down the road again i said lord i know that you want fellowship because uh you know you made it your prophet taught us that when we're reconciled to god like paul says we have every right to be in every condition that adam was before the fall folks if you need a storm to stop you should be able to stop the storm i believe it i absolutely believe it's there for us huh and he wants to fellowship and he must come come here and we're going down the road that says lord speak to me today and you know it wasn't five seconds he did brother glenn now i found out that when you want to have a fellowship with the father it's not that you're having fellowship with grandpa because if emilyn has fellowship with grandpa when we go down through walmart like she went and told her mama mama papa bought me everything oh it was just a three dollar nick not carrying a two dollar that and i can afford 15 she calls that everything but he's not a grandpa that just bestows everything upon you and that just oh man it lavishes you with things so when i ask for fellowship love fellowship lord bless me and lord i just want to have a fellowship with you talk with me i don't have a greater talk with you diving down the road and he says okay he said look at your speedometer yes lord yes lord pull it back a little well i wasn't expecting that what does a father do a child most of the time when he's growing in that right you correct me man well dude don't do this would you what you might don't start doing don't do this aren't you kids about tired of hearing that from mom and dad boy you better admit that daughter you better quit and stop that drop this stop that stop this stop that [Music] oh we don't want to hear it anymore but it's the truth it'll do a lot of good it's good for you when you get grown you'll know what you can and can't do should and shouldn't do amen we got a lot of generation out there they ain't got a clue on what they often do not to do tear down their own house i don't understand why our young generation is tearing down their own house we have a lazy generation amen i trust it's not all millennials but millennials most of the time when you see them out there they're still walking the sidewalks with their pajamas they're going to walmart they're still wearing their tablets come on huh it's sad like i said i gave room for some they're not all like that but thank god for a mom and a dad taught you how to work amen the value of a good day's work but they're thinking about that i'm getting on my track here but the lord spoke he says you know well what about that i said thank you jesus amen because he'll speak to you amen and every listen to me if you just late my this is what i got from the lord to hear in the last club if you just listen deeper oh i hope this goes out there amen [Music] every little thing that you do that's contrary to the word god will speak to you about most of the time we are listening let me tell you something and i find out most of the time we're not hearing god is wanting to fellowship with us he is wanting to talk with us but the problem is not with him talking to us how many believes that how many believe jesus loves to talk to you god loves to talk to you but it's our hearing ability that's the problem and for everything the holy spirit would convict you on that you kind of smooth it under that steal yourself in the way of him inhabiting your body you're still preventing him every little thing that you don't hear because he'll tell you if you speak too harsh to your wife he'll tell you about it if your the wife doesn't treat the husband the way that she should the holy spirit will tell you you just don't hear it because you're not here listening he'll tell you how many believes you'll do you get sensitive to the holy spirit how many had no brother ben nora that other brother that was here he said it is absolutely amazing how message believers have gotten so callous in their conscience huh and folks i'll be the first one to raise my hand hey folks i'll raise my hand lord i've gotten too calloused too calloused too hard in my heart amen he'll speak to you amen in everything praise be to god remember we're going to live with him the third thing is the third stage of it all is that he is going to have the preeminence in his people and the next thing is what in revelations 22 they shall be my people and i shall be their god we will once again be with him he was was with us in one body form just among so many people but then he's going to be with all of his saints of all the ages amen praise be to god so we see brothers and sisters how that he's looking to inhabit now i want to talk about the other habitation the other habitation is that in the age that we're living in we know that the prophet god said and i just read it this morning but he talked about how that because of music because of mostly a lot a lot of it was because of music and then of course women not dressing right and so forth at all begin at the same time and i guess elvis they called him the king of rock and roll he was one of the first to come out in that right he was one of the first to come out and do that rock thing them and the beatles and so forth they come out and i've read the histories and they'd say that right after that rock and roll was let loose and even better bam says one little song you know that they let through and they didn't censor oh my how many knows there is no censorship of nothing anymore that is way gone man folks they used to have policemen out on the beaches make sure everybody's bathing suit was so low and so long huh there ain't no sensors but what did it do it opened up the floodgates of hell there was a whole lot of rape there was a whole lot of brutal killings that happened that escalated on a massive scale as soon as that rock and roll came out what did it do it opened up for demon powers to come out and brother bam said the lid had come off of hell i mean those all of our politics all of that stuff there ain't nothing but more demons coming out inhabiting and getting into people you see it in churches you see it in the nation you see it in the government you see it in churches you see it in preachers you see it in the congregations hello it opened up the floodgate and it became revelations 18 says it this way and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory amen i believe brahman said that was the angel of this hour that angel had come down and the earth was lightened with his glory seven times around the world isn't that right healing campaigns like never before how many semi loads of cots and stretches amen in one of the meetings that they took either india africa in that right going down the street the whole city in the shutdown whole city shut down worshipping the lord the next day amen with those trucks going out there and hauling them all away and all of them singing only believe well we were almost in heaven we were ready for the rapture it was almost rapture time can you imagine i don't know about you but i love to been down them streets with them i don't love to been there just to feel the atmosphere of god so powerful healed all those people so many gave their lives to god the earth lightened with his glory but how many knows the church world didn't accept jesus christ in this hour they flat turned him away and because of it verse 2 happened and he cried with him mightily with a strong voice saying babylon is fallen nominal babylon means confusion all these 900 different churches which one is right it's confusion and those church world the church world fell how many knows is because the church world fell it's because sin is white sin the wave of sin came in the church is the type of the moon and when that let down and when they fell it let the flood of the streams come in and if you aren't founded upon the rock folks i don't care if you're a christian 30 years you can be a preacher we've had preachers in this message preached probably 30 years i don't know how long go deny the prophet deny it speak evil of it and everything walk away you never had it a son of god cannot blaspheme the holy ghost you was faking it he was an imposter that's what she was you don't you don't walk away not a son of god god doesn't god doesn't make a son of god like that and then let him go like that no it don't happen that way god isn't that foolish when he makes the son and daughter of god it's for eternity he'll hold you he that has begun a good work will finish it but now he have all kinds of imposters marriages sometimes all of a sudden the wife or the husband to go out into the world huh folks i believe that's a lot of times we don't have the victory that we do we don't have what we do because we get it on the flesh and we get it on the spirit but if he goes to that soul it has to go to that soul and change that thing amen all right babylon and that confusion that great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation not of god but of devils how many believes that's exactly the truth now people are inhabited by the devils instead of god god has a place he inhabits the devil as a place that he inhabits praise be to god and the hold of every foul spirit our church up in elkin and folks are going to have to have a vote take a vote whether they want to have homosexual preachers but he got them through that place out i'd be going so fast if they thought about taking the vote well we're going to think about it we're going to pray about it y'all pray about it i'm going to leave about it [Laughter] ain't nothing to pray about ain't nothing to think about you even think about it you're telling me i don't need to be anywhere close to this place it's the hold of every foul unclean spirit i'm sorry folks but i was watching a helicopter going over across us here the other day you know how they live homosexuals and everything else you mean to tell me there's a bunch of homosexuals out there protecting me oh my lord i know they don't want to die they're going to run probably when it comes to fighting they ain't ready to die ain't nobody ought to be in the military until they're ready ready to die not right by the glad you better be praying up and ready to give your life for god your country the only way you're going to be fit to protect the rest of us anyway that's a little military tip it's totally free all right but i'm thinking you know the world is chaos it's just corrupt it's the whole of every foul and unclean spirit we're not at home here are you at home here i'm sure not how many believes that you're a citizen of another kingdom we are a citizen of another kingdom the man was talking to his wife and he went to the grocery store and he says in the middle of the winter i mean it don't matter it can be sewn out and people go out there to the store up there at the food giant and everything else with shorts folks you don't need to be wearing that in the middle of the winter but they didn't brother brandon said man boy that can't be comfortable my listen and she he said well they just she's just got an american spirit that's all it is she says well why aren't we americans i said no not me huh we have our citizenship here he says but our true citizenship is from above he said when you go to finland when you go to germany and went to germany he would preach a campaign amen and you know and then afterwards they'd take him out and go eat somewhere and they didn't get no sweet tea but jeff they got a beer to here brother branham have one no i can't do that huh i can't do that i'm from another spirit see how many knows there's national spirits and germany it's okay don't they no they don't think nothing about it folks i'm here to tell you when i was in the world i drank that stuff and i never did like it so don't think it tastes good it don't don't even try it kids never right tastes horrible i would want to eat tea long before i want that nasty stuff but yet that's what they drink but it was their spirit they just thought it was okay praise the lord went over to finland in that right and the preacher said he was with and the next day he went out with him hey we're going to go down here down to the sauna or whatever and they took brother branham along they got in there and there was men going in there naked or just a a i don't know maybe a towel on them so far we're going in there we're going to get scrubbed we have scrub women they're going to scrub us twitched a little what what and women ain't troubling the men are they yeah yeah that's how they do here he says well i don't think so i'm not going to do that huh it was a finished spirit it wasn't right but yet they thought it was i don't know how them preachers whoever was going on in there didn't think nothing of it but it was just a spirit but brother branham had another spirit how many knows we got a holy spirit we got a holy spirit and there's things we can't do because the holy spirit won't let you do that stuff when god peels you there's a lot of stuff folks that you'll not want to do if you will still want to do that stuff you need to pray a whole lot more and you need to get your life to god a whole lot more until that desire for that is gone till all your passion all your desire is that when the holy spirit convicts you of the least little thing is god that's what i want i want nothing but your perfect will in my life that's what god is trying to form in every one of us now i believe this morning if i have a message from the lord he said the lord wants you to listen more he wants me to listen more he wants us to be able to hear what he does have to say to us and like i said it might not be some flammary thing it's going to be a fatherly speech that he's going to give to you he's our father he's our heavenly father now thankful for that aren't you glad for a heavenly father to know that you are a child of the king [Music] that's right it wasn't right brother brown says that ain't right i like that it ain't right amen why oh my listen now notice america is religious americans frolic and everything else and i said honey that's the reason that christians doesn't have any desires to act like that because they're not really americans as citizenship they are here but we are pilgrims and we're strangers you know right our citizenship is in heaven and they are born from above how many believes that you are new creation all things are passed away behold all things have become new don't let that get old to you amen always have a new life not an old life amen brother paul even there when he talked about that where i was reading about uh apostles and prophets for the perfecting of the saints he goes on down and he talks about you know that where to put off the old man and put on the new man let the old leaves fall off in the spring of the year the oak tree might have those leaves still hanging there but as new life comes on you ain't got to go pick them off and then as new life comes forth them all leaves just fall off how many wants that in your life i just want the old leaves just to fall off i want everything else just to fall off of me get away from me and let new life come that's what i want just let the holy ghost we think maybe sometimes enough but everybody not right we don't think enough about god how many will say that this week lord speak to me lord fellowship with me say something to me today i don't know about you don't we all want to hear god speak to our hearts we all want to hear god speak to our hearts because if he ain't speaking to your heart i don't know where you're at amen praise be to god that's what i want i wanted to speak to my heart listen oh i thought no matter what we have to go through with if it's trials if it's heartaches if it's persecution if it's to be laughed out and made fun of what kind of people are we to be we're sons and daughters of the king though we be in an unwelcome world how many believes that we are not welcome here folks people are letting us know we are not the devil doesn't welcome you here because he's squatting on this place he's still the prince and power of the air the political world the world wants you to know we don't like your god we don't like your christianity we don't like ten commandments we don't want none of you not dear god get our way they want us all to die i wish they'd all die and that was of them are straight up coming out and saying hey things like that happen just before a tribulation period things like that happen when people get in that mentality you have another martyr's mirror they think it they desire it and if they ever get the power to do it they'll do it because you are not in a welcome world we're not welcome here you'll never think you are and remember these unclean birds and so forth he says but there's another angel that went out and said come on my people and just before that basically says because the kings of the earth and the merchants of the earth they have been waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies folks when you think goodnight this world amen i want you to know that it is through that prostitute that catholic church you're going to own all the gold of the world they're going to have your money they're going to have your pocketbook amen so don't never get your hopes on the abundance of these delicate thieves of this world keep it with the fellowship of the father amen don't get so caught up with the delicacies of this world that you allow the holy spirit to drown out we get so busy we can't come to church oh i know how many knows when you don't make it to church the holy spirit screams at you what's wrong with you why can't you go what's your cheap excuse but we shut that out no this is important is that all right well maybe he don't you but he does me and i believe he'll do every christian that way you're filled with the holy ghost you can't wait for them doors to open oh i understand an ox being in a ditch but that box better be pretty stuck you love the lord i believe you do amen listen to what he said i read this unwelcome world though we be in a place where we're hated we're called scandalous nations what difference does it make we ought to have our chin up just like that slave remember that slave that was a slave and yet he worked hard he walked with his chest out now we don't walk like that like that like brother brown says chin up and chest out that's kind of proud it's a figure of speech you understand because a real humble christian walks with his head down wheat blood humble and so forth but at the same time down in here you're proud that your king your father is the king of a tribe isn't that right hey man you walk the way that you are wait what you act like you should because you're a child of the king amen we're going to heaven we're going to walk the streets of god we're going to be with god let's act like it let's talk like it let's walk like it let's live like it let's think like it everything we do every breath we take it's like a child of god son of god the daughter of god quit this wish you're watching us assisting us oh my trying to build something he can happen that's god there and you realize it's the greatest mystery there is i'll give you the scripture for it is that all right finishing off but says christ in you makes him the center of the revelation see and christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing i never could understand that phrase too well but it's the truth the greatest mystery the mystery of it all is that god is in you the world says ah that's just a christian ah he's just a christian you don't realize that's god how you treat him is how you treat god he is the light of that area you are the light of the world let me believe that a scripture for it's found here colossians 1 verse 25 wherefore i may the minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery amongst the gentiles what is this mystery which is christ in you the hope of glory it's the mystery they don't even know about they don't know what's going on but that's the great secret the great mysteries that god was going to dwell in you and in me and what does that do it tells you who you are that you're part of the program of almighty god and not part of this other habitation of devils unclean and hateful birds huh religious women hair like mine tight pants tights blouses whatever coming up here behind the pulpit and preaching huh remember the bible forbid every last one of them every one of those things amen paul said it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair so forth god says it's an abomination in the sight of god for a woman to wear a garment that pertains into a man there is no such a thing as women's slacks all right that's just what they named it so they wouldn't call it a man's pants huh that's right but they give them another name you love the lord this morning stand with me since you can come with our heads bowed eyes closed take the scanner of the holy spirit and look across your heart begin to search your own heart ask yourself what kind of fellowship do you have with the father how much does he speak to you every day what does he say he has a lot to say to each and every one of us now how many knows this morning that you need to be more sensitive to his voice and you need to heed that voice more it is in the lack of him telling us i truly believe he tells every everybody that he talks to everybody but they don't hear it because they're like that prospector that had found gold and he was on the way home and his dog barked and parked at night told him many times to shut him he wouldn't shut up finally took his gun and shot the dog and guess what he slept comfortably no more dog barking never heard it anymore if you're not here at hearing it remember you've hudged it you've hushed it you just don't hear it it's not that it isn't there until a man knife plunged into his heart he woke up for a few seconds before he passed away we know this story because the man that killed him confessed it before he died let's not be like that prospect or that hush that voice because i guarantee you god will lead you in a much greater way this morning if you'll hear that voice every time and if you'll heed that voice every time how many raise your hands i want to hear that voice more god bless you lord jesus we can now come before you confessing our faults and our failures and then lord jesus you're still working on us you're still building on us and this morning i believe that you have worked on the area of us and our ears and our hearing being able to hear what you have to say to us lord that still small voice that little something that tells us what to do or what we shouldn't do if we would just listen and to hear that instead of overriding it with our own voice and our own thoughts lord this morning we ask god that you look believe every hand forgive us of where we have failed to hear you like we should and lord from this sunday morning on we ask god that you help us lord to listen no matter where we are and that we would say every morning and during the day lord speak to me lord i want to fellowship with you i want to i can tell you how much i love you and i want to do that i want to speak but i also want to hear you speak back to me lord because that would be much more precious lord i ask god that you'll speak this congregation to people each heart each soul father may we experience you on a new level this week father because we have learned this morning that we need to open our ears to hear what the spirit says to us along the way not just in church but the greater things is going to be what you say to us wherever we are call that brother do a kind deed go here do that just whatever you want to say to us we want them to be able to hear it and then do and act upon it father help us not to hush that sweet wonderful still small voice that you speak to us so many times bless every heart bless every hand lord we ask you to continue to lead and guide us now in the name of jesus christ amen and amen god bless you brother [Music] amen oh i'll be somewhere listening i'll be somewhere
