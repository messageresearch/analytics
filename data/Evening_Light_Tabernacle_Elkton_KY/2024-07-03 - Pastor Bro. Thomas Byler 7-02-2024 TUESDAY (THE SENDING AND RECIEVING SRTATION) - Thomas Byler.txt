appreciated his spirit so amen amen can't think of anything else so let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you father tonight thankful Lord Jesus to be able to come together on this hot day Lord into nice air conditioned Place Lord sitting on padded pews all comfortable and all Lord and we just pray God that our Spirits would be in the area of Lord Jesus of that Heavenly places also in Christ Jesus Lord when we come in those doors that we had be at peace Lord Jesus Lord even as your scripture has said let the peace of God rule in your hearts amen that would be that we would live peaceably among all men Lord and father we thank you for the peace that you have shed abroad in our hearts God lord and the love that you've shed abroad and all that you have done for us Lord and we just want to tell you that we love you Lord Jesus and appreciate you we expecting we come expecting tonight Lord for you to come and speak to us again from your word Lord Jesus change us from glory to glory help us to go out those doors better than what we've come a little bit better than what we were Lord and we just ask God that you just continue to be with each one father that has requested prayer you know each one father and we just pray you would go there and touch them each one in a special way bless the reading of the word Lord as we open the Bible and we know that it takes your Holy Spirit to Quicken it to us we ask God for the anointing of the spirit to come now Lord and just anoint us to minister according to your word father keep ourselves out of it Lord Jesus and let it all be your spirit that we do it by we ask these blessings and favors in jesus' name amen amen and amen I want to Res I want to title this the sending and receiving station amen the sending station and the receiving station amen I was originally going to uh title it orders from headquarters amen I decided to go with something a little different amen so amen this is uh we'll just see what the Lord will have because I you know when you sometimes when you get into this and you think about this and you study and you realize how basically a lot of times I feel anyway scattered amen a little bit scattered so I mean if I'm a little scattered I just pray God will bring it together amen ain't that right because uh I was I was thinking studying and praying and been preaching for for for 30 years and still no good at it and I thought Lord if I had maybe another 200 years maybe I'd be a little better maybe 300 maybe 500 I don't know but you'd bound to get a little better after a while amen but you know you only got 60 70 years is all you got ain't that right so amen but you really amen we're going to have all the time in the world over there amen and on this side you always progress always want to get better ain't that right you have room for growth and betterment but over there you'll be perfect amen so we won't have any of that over there but amen I just can't imagine where those folks got to and how far they got how much they learned how wise they were by the time they got six or 700 years old imagine being 750 years old oh I'm 850 years old that's inconceivable almost isn't it for us amen so this little 70-year life is awful short lifespan it's awful short amen but anyway so we'll do the best we can with the help of the Lord amen and if you will I just have two scriptures is all I've got one is in uh John John 3 and then Romans 8 amen amen just to show you amen this is this this service of course this is amen all right St John 3 5 through 8 Jesus answered verily verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again amen how many remember brother Bram preaching on you must be born again Welly that was powerful wasn't it nothing else will do is that right now where are we going to go is after this thought of being born again he says verse eight the wind bloweth where it listeth and he heareth the sound thereof but can not tell when it cometh or and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit may God add His blessings to the read of the word amen let's read one more before you're seated I caught you on that one didn't I all right Romans 8 and 29 for whom he wait 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose you can be seated amen amen I like that praise the Lord so this first scripture that we want to just start with amen talks about how that a person that's born of the spirit amen is like the wind amen like the wind and there's very few times I think that the scripture talks about somebody being like the wind that is born of the spirit amen we talk much about amen being anchored to the Rock isn't that right amen and to be unmovable and all these other things that it talks about and and uh uh you know it talks about the the wind driving the chaff away you know it just talks about a lot of things but here uh it talks about basically from what I'm understanding in this is that the spirit amen is what leads a Christian and I think one example that came to mind I believe it was philli isn't it what was uh ministering somewhere brother bam said having a Revival and God wanted him to go somewhere and he just transported him over to that unic with that Chariot ain't that right transported him right there in the middle of it now brother brandham talking about it he says you know he's learned to always follow the leading of that Spirit ain't that right amen and brother Brandon got in trouble of course you know when he went to Africa I believe it was and God Holy Spirit they were had one meeting at a certain city I don't know just which one it was anymore but and the Holy Spirit was telling them stay right here stay right here but he had already made a league basically and was with a bunch of men ministers amen and he was already basically had agreement with him that we're going to go this that or the other and and uh you know there was no room for hey this is what God tells us to do you know but we want we've got plans to go up and they would not change their plan well from what I understand there was monsoons and everything that could go wrong did go wrong when they didn't follow the leading of the spirit much is to be said there because even Billy Paul said Dad man if God told you to do it then do it you know and brother brandham didn't and for years he was sick sick isn't that right he suffered for years because that he didn't follow the leading of the spirit amen and so I think after that he talked he said he talked about amen getting messed up with a bunch of preachers amen so how many knows whether it's should church or whether whatever it is when you're led by God it's important that you follow God not just every not and it's important to have a head isn't that right important to have a leader is't that right and that leader is the Holy Ghost how much better off all of those brothers would have been if they had recognized that this was a prophet of God cuz he came and told them he says God said to not to go and you'll pay for it if you do I mean yeah he told them he warned them he did his part but they still wouldn't listen amen how many know that when you don't do what the Holy Spirit tells you to do you end up paying for it it's it's never good amen amen so I want to I want to just take a few illustrations if I can I want to start with governments I want to talk about cars I want to talk about families I want to talk about your jobs amen and so forth amen and bring into into our thought amen of leadership basically you know because like I said this could be titled many headship leadership Unity whatever you might want to say but amen um so we want to look at the government first of all how many knows that now we're living in a world where they don't want any kind of order they don't want want any kind of leadership amen people are getting uh they're getting upset with the Supreme Court because they made a decision is it right oh they're just a bunch of you know they're they going against this just shut up that's what they decided on ain't that right but AB Bram talked about an absolute you know in a ball game you know that Empire it doesn't matter how hot you get it don't matter what that that that humire is the absolute and it's a good thing you got it cuz can you imagine the parents that fight each other and everything else go on if they had a democracy about whether that was a ball or whether that was a strike why they could never make it to the second inning why because no this one said it was this and that one saw it all was that oh my you just have chaos I want you to understand that a world that is not does not have leadership is a world of chaos I don't care if it's in your family I don't care if it's in your church I don't care if it's your individual I don't care where it is amen we know the government set up Amen to where we have like the president of the United States He is the leader isn't that right and then the leader of a or a state is called the governor the leader of a city is called a mayor amen then you've got your Police Department in that City and so forth he is called the sheriff and under him of course is connected to your deputies and so forth just like in a family we've got the husband who's the head of the uh family isn't that right then you've got the wife you got the children everything is connected and as long as everything is in order everything works good how good it all works when it works the way that it's supposed to [Music] amen hallelujah how good it works to be a Christian when you're the kind of Christian that you're supposed to be isn't that right amen now how many knows that God in every in all of nature all of nature God said I believe in Romans he says that you can look at the nature and see God why because everything is a reflection of him brother bam said all the natural types the spiritual and that all natural types the spiritual and so you can look at the natural and all of that and see that this God is the way that he ordained it and today while we've got you know all the conf confusion that we do is because a lack of leadership a lack of Direction and I thank God for direction I'm glad when somebody said you can't do that you shouldn't do that how you glad for rules why if you didn't have any rules you'd have a Walmart scenario with a mom going down through there and the kid screaming to the top of their voice quiet now quiet now quiet be quiet huh you'd have chaos ain't that right but when you got rules you got somebody sitting there quietly mama ain't got to fuss mama ain't got to have all those issues got to have order how beautiful that order is when things are in control and you and I were made to have something in here that leads us that controls you how many believes you're going to be led by something amen that's right you're going to be led by something you're going to be full of something let me change my settings here for just a minute on home screen so that it'll stay on for me from two minutes to 10 minutes I'm going to go go ahead I only got a five six five or six here now listen how many believes that there's only two Powers two powers in the world brother bam said that's right two Powers there's two kingdoms in this world world that we're living in amen all the rest all the minor things that's connected with either one of those Powers that's the power of God or the power of Satan as I was thinking about that even today remember every little deed that people do every move people make every move that you make every thought that you think how many believes it's all by one power or the other and what I'm getting to every war every disorder everything that comes along it's either controlled by God's power or Satan's power because there's only two powers and that is the power of God and the power of life I like what it said it's either controlled controlled by God's power so you're going to be moved by something ye amen you're going to be moved by something I don't know what we would do if we didn't have the message of the hour ain't that right where would we be if we would be in Pentecost think of where we would be look at the confusion and the mess that's there Baptist Methodist wherever it might be amen I'm going to say this you leave the message you you you leave believing that you better stay with what the prophet you leave that and you start adding to your own ideas and everything else and you'll be in the mess also you'll be in a chaos amen I don't think you got to be in a denomination to be a denomination you know you know you can be a denom one man one person denomination it's when you want to do it according to the way that you think that it ought to be done rather than the way that the word says that it was done I've lived long enough I preached long enough to know that most of the time when you're preaching when you're any part of this word there's always two sides of it there's always two ways of looking at it whether you're such a dry church until icicles are hanging off of the wall ain't that right or on the other part if you're really full you're a quiet person you know or you can be quiet he might be still hello amen so it can be either way and it takes what I'm trying to say is it takes the Holy Spirit to lead you and to guide you know when like uh Ecclesiastes talked about he says there's a time for this and there's a time for that and a time for this ain't that right and for you to Navigate to navigate through all of this it takes the leadership of the holy spirit amen and so you got to have a navigator you got to have something that navigates you a GPS so to speak amen amen two powers and you're going to be controlled that's going to control amen you got to have a country how many knows our country is what out of control plum out of control you can't have women's sports nowadays ain't that right folks you know just not so long ago one an athlete I they just forfeit it because it was going to be a trans coming against her I just forfeit why because the left that wants everything so equal they want it all so e equal and so fair they want they don't want nothing Fair they don't want nothing equal they sure don't want nothing Fair amen oh my I might as well say it there gry matter has really got scbl up up in there it's some really I don't know what kind of bug got up in there but it's really bad because they can't think right anymore and you're controlled by one or you're controlled by the other amen now my story basically the story that I wanted to start with was the uh when brother Brandon was up in Canada if you remember and he was preaching and there was this um TV salesman that he was going down through there the next next year I guess he was going down the streets and so forth and he went by this guy that was selling TVs and he got to talking to this guy about the TV screen and so forth because that guy said ah you aren't with that with what do you you with that brandom outfit are you yeah I just what do you think about him yeah I think he's the biggest hypocrite ever and all that other stuff you you know and then here just a little bit later in the conversation brother Braham says I am brother Braham he says oh wow so I just called you a hypocrite to your face he says I would rather you do it to my face than behind my back he said that's the right way to do it just s it to my face you know I don't know that this man got converted but there was very few people that didn't get converted when they come in contact with brother brandom ain't that right that Infidel of 70 years I'm getting off my subject I guess but that's not all right but the Infidel of 70 years ain't that right when he was going to squirrel hunting I can't think of his buddy that took him squirrel hunting but his buddy went up there because he knew his dad ain't that right so he went up there and talked to him a little bit and he got this say you mean you've gotten so low down you got to carry a preacher wherever you go ain't that right he says and the brother BR says well I may you think maybe I need to step out he stepped out of the cow come on up there with all of that blood on him and all this side or the other and you all know the story amen and finally got to talking about the apples and the apple trees isn't that right you know the apple trees that he planted you know the Bible talks about becoming all things to all people isn't that right so that you might win some that don't mean necessarily become like them hello folks and so forth amen but to be able to go down on their level and begin to call pick up their conversation if you're a farmer talk about farming amen come down to where they are but certainly don't partake of their s or there wrong amen but anyway so what I was saying is that even there he led him but here he was brother brandham was talking about how that uh he was talking about this uh television and how you know uh how that there's a uh in that television because that man didn't believe anything that he couldn't be scientifically proved right anything that isn't scientifically proved you know and he says I'll prove anything that you can see isn't real and only the things that you can't see is real everything that you see is temporal just had a thought coming in mind I hope I can pick it up later but I'll just say this how many believes that we we it's time that we have the mind of God it's time that we pick up the mind of God and think the way that he does amen that's all about that control that control down on the inside will cause you to think the way that God thinks and it won't look so much on the things of this Earth as it does about your spiritual welfare where you are with God the things of God are will be number one over anything else when you're thinking the way that God thinks amen God bless you Josh and sister Leah amen so uh anyway I want to get on that maybe a little bit later but I wanted to just say that before I forget it because it came to mind but that's part of Amen what's happening I truly believe that's what's happening but this this uh he was talking to him and so forth and he was talking about how that in is he said it's super natural he said it's supernatural because he man he says where's that guy you know on this television there was somebody doing some music or whatever plumbed down in Chicago and they were way up there and he says you know there's this you know there's it's no telling how many PL people that that invisible picture has to go through a't that right because maybe you just have an antenna or whatever and it's got to pick up a signal and so forth and he says you know uh and he could prove he was trying to say to brother brand I can prove that you know it it's real because you it picks it up right here the crystal picks it up and he said to brother bam he says they have a sending station where they send all the signals and the pictures and it comes here and we pick it up amen and he picks it up and he says oh that's wonderful see there's something Supernatural about and he said oh yes but see that's easy he said we've got that's easy to explain because we've got a sending station and a receiving station and I said I said so do we so do we how many believe that God has a place where he's sending his signal sending his word but there has to be somebody to receive it we which are alive and remain into the coming of the Lord so that somebody has to receive that that has to come into somebody and change their body and prove that it's real to go from the invisible to the visible amen so have we amen that's right we got a sending station and a receiving station certainly just tune out all the static the unbelief out and watch what takes place watch that picture clear up that's right you say oh yes I Lord I see it now that's what makes the different it depends on how much static you let get in see amen just stay right with God and with the word and God will bring it right straight to path pass as positive every time amen the thought tonight is connection connection amen somewhere that it's sent from and then it has to connect somewhere else when a president says something ain't that right his word is pretty powerful everybody's supposed to knck down they're supposed to do what he says amen they're supposed to especially when it's according to the law and so forth and everything that that he's supposed to uphold the chain of command comes on it's all connected comes down you know just like uh uh you know the the a federal law is supposed to be over a state law a that right they're supposed to be but the state laws are supposed to be subject but makes it it makes a little bit of a static it makes it a little bit disconnected when the federal law is breaking the law yeah and you're trying to uphold the law as we've seen with what we over in Texas and so forth with immigration ain't that right and upholding the law this out of the other then you get all kinds of friction but you know it's supposed to work together good how many believes that and when you don't it get it all messed up you got to have all of that all of the connections has to be the way that it's supposed to be and me when it is you have Unity ain't that right when everything's unified it's just so much better amen but I'm thankful now I've got another one I don't think that I had time to put this on my iPad when God made man he made him thus amen he made him with this little compartment in the man in his own for his own throne for his control tower part of the reason I said you know I'm so glad that we have the message so that we understand that we as human beings we were not meant to control or lead oursel and we were made a certain way how many believe we were made a certain way and if that certain way isn't connected the way that it's supposed to be amen then you've got major problems you've got confusion usion you've got incompletion amen I was I wasn't going to say this but I was trying to one of my lights under my cabinet blew a few weeks ago and I bought a new Under The Cabinet light wired it up flipped the breaker and you know I guess when the plug in I should have made sure I marked the the little part where supposed to be the ground or the white one and the black one I didn't do that but one had a lot more black on it than the other I put it on still flip the breaker I mean it flipped the breaker so I flipped switched them around throw the breaker back on and flip the switch and the whole thing boom I'm like well that sure wasn't right hello blew my $3 light up I said there it went $30 ain't no fixing that big boom amen how many knows when you don't get connected right amen when you don't get it right it goes boom things blow up things don't go right Sparks Fly when you don't get it right but how glorious it is how sweet it is part of this is is how what a what a wonderful walk it is what a wonderful thing it is to be a Christian this again will go along with what we're talking about amen amen praise praise the Lord I like this God wants to lead man but man wants to lead himself therefore there is a war constantly the man wants to go after the things that he sees with his eyes amen that's right preach it brother brandom Thomas B we all always want to go after the things with that you know that that that we want I want this and I want them I see this that or the other what you ought to desire more is the peace of God more of the Holy Ghost more of the things you can't see oh my brother Sean you might not be able to see it I might not be able to see it brother Glenn brother Patty s sister Patty sister Sher Lon we're not be be able to see it but we can sure feel it we can sure feel it you can just be up here for a little while and you begin to feel it more and more why it's not about feeling yeah but we know that most our folks it is not fun not to feel good it's not fun when you're feeling down and out now we all want to feel the whole world wants to feel good amen people will take that crack stuff down in Philadelphia under that bridge and they'll be going have you ever seen them yeah just spaced out on crack middle of the streets why because they want to feel good they'll sacrifice their home family everything else just to feel good aren't you glad you ain't got to go around looking like a freak CU zombie and everything else just to feel good and then have it have him to overdose you most likely and send you to a devil's hell amen they got an injection station maybe they got a place to put all their injection let me tell you something we got an injection station it's right here this is The Filling Station come in here we want you to come here filled up but if you ain't you come to the right Filling Station come to the right place even those listening if you'll receive the word of God it'll fill you up it'll give you joy unspeakable and full of Glory all right amen praise the Lord so man was not made to lead himself it's just listen so that's where he's deceived that's where SE Satan deceived Eve by what she could see the fruit was pleasant so is it tonight God wants to lead man so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that that man would be led by the spirit of God getting off of his own leadings amen which is what separated him from the fellowship to begin with man always trying to achieve something by his head he says but he's supposed to achieve by his heart amen that's the control tower where God wants to control him and directs his thoughts directs his walks directs his emotions sometimes I get so happy I just have to let loose and if I look around and see some somebody then see see I got my eyes on people then but God help me to close my eyes keep my eyes closed and I just want to be led by the spirit of God that the flesh will have nothing to do with it amen how many believes that that's right sometime when you come to church don't worry about everybody else close your eyes and Worship the Lord because as long as you you know you'll see something and it'll distract you but close your eyes amen be worship Him in spirit and in truth Amen Let me just go down a couple more here amen I have a a rough page what I call a rough page where I just rough in my thoughts and rough in my thoughts and then I want to put it over on the page the way that I want to do it well I bought my rough Pages because they were so full I didn't want to rewrite it all is that all right amen when God is where he's supposed to be amen right here and there's nothing in between is that right no static and you are where you're supposed to be how many can say now that's a good place to live that's a good I like that place amen I don't know what everybody got AT&T or if You' got a Verizon or what you got or what your phone does in here but in my metal house and so forth when you get a certain place you get under certain kind of metal and certain insulation all of a sudden you lose your signal amen and you don't got no signal you can't call out anymore you lose your contact so to speak how many believes contact communication is vital in a Christian's walk especially in war and so forth how many know one of one of the first things they want to knock out is communication amen it's so vital in our lives to have the communication with God the way that we should I'm sure that if we're sitting here tonight listening to wherever you are that your goal would be that you would have so be so tuned in to God until God could use you the way to he did brother Brandon in Memphis Tennessee God stopped that plane he made the the the electronics in it mess up there's something wrong here we can't go nowhere yet right they had to check it out while he goes down the street over here do I take a right or do I take a take a left a that right take a right go down this alley amen didn't he even go into the black Waters not a best not a good place to be a lot of times the bad side of town the Poor Side of Town get robbed get mug get whatever is that right but he went he followed leading him to went right where he was supposed to be Lord help us tonight I don't know about you but I like to listen to that voice every day how many believe I believe that each one of us has that voice in our hearts every day that voice speaks to you it does me oh here you are you're beating with a hammer and and so forth but I don't I've got a I've got a ritual I've got a habit what did Brother Ram say that we ought to do with prayer he said make it a habit to pray that right make it a habit me and my wife we like to go out on that front porch and watch our Martins she said I said that I was shooting my Martin I wasn't shooting my Martin if I say something wrong y'all correct me because sometimes I'll say it opposite of what I'm supposed to it happens after 59 now if I lost where I was huh praying right that's right make it a habit I almost got confused all these different voices you know everybody answer for I still don't know what's going on that's right make it a habit to pray me and my wife sit down on the front porch have our coffee before we do anything go anything we'll hold hands we'll talk to the Lord amen you know some people have a daily planner that right I thought man I not have a daily plan I like to have a daily planner amen you I'd get more done if I had wrote down what I want to do today cuz I like it folks when I want to you know when I get want to get a certain thing done I want to get this much done and that much done you know this is what I want to do and this is what I want to get I get irritated if I don't get all of that done but most of all I say Lord what do you want me to do today Lord what is it that you want me to do today amen how many knows it makes a big difference sometimes I'll call somebody I'll text somebody I just feel that to text this person I feel that to do this that or the other and you just text them you know or or you do this that or the other and when you feel like doing something and don't you certainly regret it don't you sir why because that's being led by that control tower amen we were meant to have that God made us to where we would have what I would might call a power pack amen I thought about tools I thought about tools how that you can have a skill buddy you can cut some boards Ain that right maybe Billy L's Sawmill back there remember that back there and he was running on electric right brother John running on electric that's right great big old saws cutting them logs up all day long oh by the power of electric flip that breaker one time see what it does don't do nothing that's the way it is with a Christian when you get your Breakers mod you're absolutely good for nothing your hand your skills are if you don't get it plugged in hello you got no power you can't do nothing got a lot of illustrations that are kind of different it might sound mechanical but I know this is not a mechanical mechanical thing but even the brother Brandon brought it down to a mechanical thing when he talked about the Cadillac is that right and the mechanics of all the Cadillac is't that right and then also of the Dynamics you got to have both isn't that right both mechanical and he used as an illustration that I want to use with the help of the Lord amen praise the Lord now let's first talk about in the Army in the military in the military there's also what we would call connection or order that if you don't have that you will be defeated is that right if you don't have order you'll be defeated he said the brains of an army lays in its captains the intelligence raml in Germany I guess it's raml in Germany was the brains of Germany not Hitler raml that's right Eisenhower military men Patton those men who were at the front it depend on which way they gave the order you follow your captain can you imagine who was it listen follow your captain if he's got the right kind of a general if he's the right kind if he's a fourstar if he's proved if he's proven to be right follow him though it may seem wrong to you go on to the front do as you are told Hallelujah we've got a five-star general spelled j s u s placing five stars of on us Faith he's never lost a batt b battle yet Hallelujah he conquered death hell the grave all the Devils out of the way he's a great Captain so the devil isn't even in the picture Amen in the greatest battle he ever fought amen our captain our five-star general in World War II brother Glenn you was in the military so I've got your ears but Brian too can you imagine a Little Grunt or a little private coming up and say hey Captain you I got a good idea for this one I I think I know how we can do it huh oh my how many wars have you been this is my first one kick him in the backside and get back in your place you'll get us all killed ain't that right no you would never listen to somebody like that not some amateur not somebody that doesn't know hasn't been there those festar generals they've been s so many battles and everything they know how to lose they know how to win a that right and man they know how to go about it 100 times better than what that grunt or that young one does so it's the intelligence of it wo think about our general how many knows our general is a fstar general j s u there ain't a smarter General anywhere we know that the devil has had 6,000 years of experience ain't that right he has got 6,000 years of smarts built up he's gotten smarter and he's got smarter the dumb guy did dumb guy got smarter I said dumb guy for a reason folks cuz my captain never was dumb my go my captain never did have to learn he never have to have experience he's the author he's the engineer his mind and his thoughts are perfect to begin with he's never had to evolve how manyan believes his weapons and his Warfare amen they never have to get any better W think that's our captain when you're connected to him you'll defeat that devil every time that's right one of the schemes the devil wants and he likes is for you to make you believe that you can defeat him without the holy ghost that you can defeat him on your own he wants you to think that because he knows you can't ain't that right all right I I think I'll drop off of that one but in the military everything has to be yes sir is that right yes yes sir yes sir how many believes in with us who's he that loveth me if you love me keep my Commandments yes sir if you love God and if you want to win do what you're told I ain't got to figure out how to win I got to just listen to what he said and do what he said and you'll win try to do it your way one time and find out how much you lose unfortunately there's a lot of message Believers think they can do it their way and win no you can't you can't go against the word of God and win you won't win it has to be according to the word of God God help our minds ain't that right I love it when me and my wife man will she'll say something and I'll say that's what I was thinking maybe working together with my boys you think something and that's what I was thinking that's on the same wavelength same wavelength how many beli you've got to be linked on the same wavelink as Christ if you're going to BN if you're going to overcome because remember Jesus is Worthy of all praise all honor and all glory is that right but it says that his bride's going to sit with him in his throne because she is worthy how many believes you're going to be worthy God's going to make you worthy amen you don't want you wouldn't want you want somebody that with the intelligence I like that and I brought that about intelligence it's the intelligence of anybody any kind of a battle it's it's it's the general that has the brains they try to figure it out they you know it's the smart of them amen and God trans ERS his smarts amen down into not your head not your head but into your heart amen that's the control to that's that's the power pack as we might say Amen praise the Lord amen next next example I want to read this and maybe just get a fresh Revelation a little bit new revelation out of it brother Bram talking about Dynamics and so for talking about the Cadillac now for instance if we were going to Tucson this afternoon and each of us was going in a big Cadillac brand new all of the seats were do skin sof soft of leather soft to sit in easy to sit in floorboards were plushed the steering wheel were nickel plated and they had diamond studs all over the engine was mechanically tested be exactly the right engine Wheels all the bearings grease tires puncture proof and free it all tested scientifically there had and had been pushed off the assembly assembly line both of them and both of them filled with gasoline that's the running power the gasoline because in it is the octane now when you go to startom although both of them look Al light and there was one of them didn't have any spark any firing power well you say the power is in the gasoline brother brandom but I don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's spark there to manifest that power amen L there's a power there to confirm that it's gasoline it might as well be water amen we've got the mechanic we've got what was the Holy Ghost given for we've got perfect Faith perfect love we've got all of the mechanics of the word how many believe the fullness of the word has been restored it's been given us back acts 238 repentance in Jesus name baptism my every part of the mechanics it's all there amen tells us that we're sons of God that we're redeemed back amen into the same condition that Adam was before the fall W how many knows that's a big mouthful that you're restored back to God and fellowship with him just like Adam was before the fall amen that you can speak to mountains and they'll move trees they'll move Bulls they'll move Hornets they'll move storms they'll move they were an example wasn't that an example all the mechanics is there but if it's just if it doesn't have that spark there if that connection's not there it might as well be water it don't mean nothing thing if the spark ain't there let me tell you you got to plug in that plug in if the breaker's off it is do a bit of good and that's the way it is with a Christian tonight you come to church you ain't got the Holy Ghost you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost how do you get it by repenting turning around from the way that you're do and saying God I Repent I ain't doing it no more please fill me with the Holy Ghost give me the power never to do it again and watch come what God come down it don't matter who it is I don't care how old you are if you're 95 years old or if you're 13 years old that pattern is for you for your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call you've got to have the Firepower you got to have the contact you've got to have the connection no matter how good word how true the word you got to have that fire that spark and what is that spark that spark is God where is it at it's in your heart how many knows that Bo Moses when he seen God he SE the burning bush amen God is a consuming fire is what the Bible says he is a fire amen but come down on the Amen on the day of Pentecost tongues of fire how many of these that's why he said man we're on fire why because the Holy Ghost is in our hearts it burns it does something it makes the word real amen you love him tonight that's the control tower where God controls man it directs his thoughts directs his walk direct directs his emotions how many believ that directs every part of you every thought that comes into your mind it directs it it leades it it guides it amen there's a whole lot said in the message about headship and I this just comes to me because I've got it wrote down here talking about a family talking about headship what is what do you got when you ain't got headship in a family you've got confusion amen you've got confusion when you don't don't have any headship husband is the head of the wife wife over to children is't that right then it goes down to servants and so forth amen and when you've got that when woman marries a husband he supplies for her honey I need groceries honey I need this honey I need that all right we'll get you some Isn't it nice when he can get you everything he may not be able to get you everything but with God he will supply all your needs Accord to his riches in Christ Jesus we've got a Heavenly husband that has got everything that we have need of I like it I like that kind of hat chip woo where you don't even have to have your own thoughts and your own ideas you just think the way he wants you to think amen it's just like a job amen somebody just comes on the job amen they ain't been there one day and they come up there to boss and he's got an idea ain't that right my wife's getting into it huh got an idea I think we ought to run it this way son you ain't been here long to give me your opinion all right I don't even want to hear that that opinion get back over there and do what you're told isn't that right we've been doing this for years amen amen that's right amen I'm so glad that we have a father that knows exactly how to do it right time the First Time Lord Here I Am Lord Jesus I want that right way every time father don't let me mess up lead me in every aspect of my life let me do it right every time from this Wednesday night on I know I might mess up but it'll be messed up because I got in the way not because God it no he tried to lead me but if not it'll be my fault amen it'll run much better for you life will be much better for you if you listen to that still Small Voice that comes down amen that's right amen there's so much more in here all things work together for good folks we used to have a horse and a buggy and a harness and have the Horseshoe and have a blanket maybe if it was cold is that right but now what have we got we got Vehicles we got cars and thank God it isn't the model A huh you'd almost have to go have a hole down there and try to help it out a little bit right no but you got a vehicle is that right I got wrote down it's Amen being a Christian is and being under the power of God it's like being that that Cadillac a that right plush seats how many got you got nice seats amen you got all these other things but you know I wanted to say and I wrote down here God is my gas pedal God is my brakes what is what what what is it that causes the car going down the road uh you know speed up and slow down is this little pedal that you put foot pushes just some little pedal isn't that right you push on that pedal and whoa here we go is that right then there's another little pedal over here on the left called the brake pedal and man when you want to slow down right now what if you just had a pedal there that was disconnected and you know sometimes we need one over on the other side for our partner right just give them a pedal to push on because they want to help you drive my wife did not so long ago I was trying to take somebody and and we run off the road and she about went off on [Laughter] me drive drive I'm in the car text Tex oh you know sometimes you think it's important you about run off the road but that's right if you had that pedal it wasn't connected but that connection goes to what to a cable or or or something that puts us on a cylinder amen and it goes into a brake line it goes all the way down into them brakes and it squishes them break pads together just the pedal don't do it but because it's connected there's power there amen they don't call it power steering for nothing God is oh my here we go a't that right think about it God is my ignition amen cuz when you go out amen what is without a key amen without that key are you going anywhere boy isn't it terrible when you lose your keys oh it's just a terrible thing because you got to have that key in order to ever power that car how many knows that God gives you Faith he gives you that key and says take this key of Faith amen and turn the thing over cuz when you turn that thing over something comes from the battery amen it brings a spark to the spark plug am me that spark go goes from there amen it goes to something that's making that thing shoot a little bit of gas in there and boom W here we go that's what happens when you prayed up huh you come to church prayed up come to church expecting because you expect the preacher to be ready you expect him to be ready he comes out here you better have something ain't that right but you get to sit coming here and you don't have to be ready you ain't to be nothing you going to sit on a flesh little C cushion seat and you're just going to sit back and huh no you ought to come and say Lord here I am come down tonight amen I'm ready now here I'm preparing I'm going to pull on the gift of God and I know you come to oh my the but B says when he's praying back there amen the church is expecting when he comes out under the he said that's the same is God speaking you receiving the word amen and being changed and going out there a different person than what you came in but you got to get ready too just like the preacher got to get ready you come in here oh it's a Wednesday night again you're going to hear Thomas B again rattling and on and everything else I hope it's more than rattles to you I hope it's a little more when any preacher comes up here but you come and say God I know that no matter who's up there huh cuz we got a little James 3 in us some sometimes well if it's certain preacher I'll amen and mo I'll be really into it but if it's another one nah not really you respect your a person backslid sorry outfit amen I don't care if we get a donkey up here I'm expecting huh God's used the donkey before amen boy that guy I don't think much of him he ain't much of a Preacher but come expecting open up your ears a little bit you'll get something all right Ain in that I me that's right and another thing it means brothers and sisters is sending and receiving station it comes down into your heart a't that right and then that controls that controls and brother Bram talked about how that the headship the head has come down the head ship has come down to the body and that headship is the word is't that right the word typifying the head now you might think well your mind your mind whether I jump or not depends on whether I want to or not it's what my head tells me what my head tells me everything my head tells me that I do amen however it goes deep ER than that because this here needs to be in charge of this here a't that right not just this being in charge of the body but this being in charge of the body because you just go by this brother Bram said what the devil uses a man's head God uses a man's heart all you have is this here and you don't have that control tower buddy you'll go places and do things unimaginable I mean you look out there and you can see what that's all about amen not a place that you want to go amen back to the carford just a minute amen I remember brother Braham talked about having automatic faith and manual faith and things like that and people live their lives manually basically or or automatically like and everything is supposed to be automatic because I used to have a 72 Chevy truck I remember when I first married my wife the rocker panels was rusted out and you could probably see out the door a little bit down through there and you know every time we come up to a red light I'd have to stop the truck get out pop the hood and get them gears I'm stuck cuz well he one of them shifters you know and I almost every light I had to go out there and do it folks she sat up beside me and loved me just as much as if I was driving a nice Corvette but I'll tell you it's not something that's fun to do is to go out there and have to CH I'll manually do this at or the other what that isn't it nice just to pull it down out woo can I say something Christian just put it in drive and let him drive cuz he's my steering will he's I'm not the captain he's the captain that's steering whe in my life let him turn you this way like he did Phillip turn you that way like you did Brother bam and me turn you this way or that way he is in control he is my got a hold of my steering wheel he got my gas pedal amen he's my throttle when he says go I go when he says stop I stop how many times God tells you now don't do that you know you won't want to do that don't do that don't don't do that and then you stop who where God tells you to do something step on the gasp go do this go do that ain't that right amen and you're riding with him joy unspeakable and full of Glory peace that passes understand standing like the cars we got today just turn on the good good music a't that right hey man I thought had to double think of whether I wanted to say it or not I'll go ahead and say it you might need to laugh I was coming home from Hopkinsville the other day and I was listening to one of my I you know I got this new uh little GPS thing in my truck because when I bought the truck I wanted the truck with the screen and backup and all that other stuff lights you know like you know and when I got this one I bought it it didn't have any of that so the other day I went to Costco was it where was it Donna Best Buy yeah and they uh had one on sale and they've installed that thing for me and and you know they install it in there when they got it in there and it sinks with my radio or my my phone and everything and I go to play in the music I like what on there and man I'll tell you what they have some kind of amplifier it is amped up brother when I go to Boogie and I mean I'm bie no not really when I turn that up it's loud so man some of those good song Oh I know yes I know Jesus blood no matter what all of them good songs and I was coming home from Hopkinsville just listening to that song and there's an Amish cart going right by there and just as I was going by there I cranked it up I cranked it up I y'all don't know what you're missing out there in I'm hot buggy and I got AC and I got my music there you go I said what I thought and hesitated on saying I guess it wasn't so bad right but isn't that right people live in Luther's age Wesley's age am mean an age going by a Pentecost while you got to speak in Tong no we're not living there folks we're living in Jesus Christ in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Jesus we got him on the steering wheel we got him on the gas pedal we got him on the brakes we're listening to him every day we let him control how many believe that why because that's the way we were made we I like it that way don't you just love being led by the spirit it's so much better when you live every day being led by the spirit not yourself the mornings are better the noons are better the evenings are better the nights are better the pillow is better your sleep is better when he's in control when you're not trying to run it yourself God was not man was not meant to lead himself he we were meant to be powered by almighty God if you're not you've got a problem Houston amen I many know when they're up there and then the astronauts up there I mean something Mal functions it doesn't matter where you're out in the sea and you have a have a have an emergency and SOS you know and you try to get somebody on the phone you try to get somebody to come and help you hello I'm glad that we have somebody that'll help us all right final let me go down here brother Braham says until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved on him to do the things that he did if he hit all 16 cylinders so will the bride amen I hope you don't have a life of sputter praise the Lord on Sunday and Monday I'm all depleted Tuesday I'm all defeated by Wednesday man I'm here to tell you I don't know if I'm a Christian or not come on no Let It Burn like brother brandom even talk about how smoothly it goes Isn't it nice to turn that key over Crank It Up put it down and drrive and hit that gas pedal and forward you go here we go woo what a drag it is when you turn it over like my Sequoia because it's so old and sometimes you just leave the door a jar and the light will train that battery turn it over and there ain't not in a light come on kind of like what some people feel maybe sometime when they come to church there's just no lights coming on here need some more juice need to re be recharged AR don't we get that way sometimes sometimes we need to recharge amen praise the Lord all hit all 16 cylinders so will the bride that's right the works that I do shall he do also how many believes that amen if we're plugged in if we have the right Spirit the way that we're supposed to have the works he did will do also I thirst I thirst give me more as David said my soul thirsts for God for the Living God I see like I say like Gideon if God before us is with us where are all his miracles how many wants to see more of God you'll do it when you follow that leading can I have just a little more time oh I printed this one out back there brother brandham how many knows he talked about the astronaut age how that we're in the astronaut age way above the horse and buggy way above the airplane way above the 747s hello way above there don't have to worry about traffic lights anymore in your flesh you do in your flesh you're still in leosia hello is that right but in your spirit you in in an astronaut way up there you hypocrite you ain't nothing but a phony well praise the Lord I love you too brother huh as not devil trying to get you down with his storms huh did you know somebody said that about you Josh I'm telling you they really bad said bad stuff about you Jos says oh really I don't I don't even have to know but I'm going to be praying whoever it was that God will just bless him huh up astronaut age above the clouds above the storms above all of that how many would to live there that's right storm comes along really oh that's not so bad we're used to flying but it's really windy it's getting blowing blowing hard here that's nice why because I'm an eagle I've learned to take that wind and let it lift me on up set my tail just right and guess what we just fly up up up way above there how many believes that we need to look at that again we should look at that again see if we're really up there where we should be but he talked about how that there man has been able to achieve amen going into outer space but they did it and they would control the shuttle and the space shuttle I think at Mars and and and that robot they had on one of those planets you know they would control it from down here ain't that right can you imagine some other planet I'm not sure just what it was but they way up there and they've got some kind of a robot going around and me taking pictures and controlling it from down here and so forth my my in the same way he was talking about hot at man when he was up there in that way up there in as an astronaut not notice the natural astronaut has a something to control him when the astronaut is in the air he has something backwards here back here here on the earth that controls him it's called radar that radar moves him around amen I'm sure you read me spiritually shows where he's at tells where he's going and that radar controls him from that radar Tower here on Earth that's the natural astronaut so the spiritual astronaut has a control Power has a control tower amen it's not down here like man see it's up there and it's the Holy Spirit that's in him that's controlling him the Tower of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen he was talking about that television how they have ascending station and in that television the way that it's made has a certain Crystal and it picks up that signal just like every channel it picks that signal up and that's what the Holy Ghost does in your heart it picks up the signal hey I want you to do this I want you to do that nbody believes that I wonder if tomorrow you won't have a testimony of brother berer Thursday the Lord told me something I followed that and it was a blessed thing amen control tower it's down here all right now notice it's under control keeps him in control by the word not a bunch of Fanatics fanaticism some whooped up nonsense but thus saith the Lord and it happens it's always under control he's got a control tower that's the Holy Ghost amen that's God's program amen now listen so they got in their great science ific tube here not long ago the astronaut tube and are talking about a countdown heading to the Moon they're getting off here too he says and they got an astronaut in a big tube powered by atomic power and they can send it plump to the Moon they claim and then they got it in their tube and they're waiting for that countdown now notice the spiritual astronaut got in Christ and is listening to the countdown how many May beli we're looking for a countdown we're listening like Terry Tidwell I think made that song He said I've been listening for a different sound is that right voice of the Brin we're looking around we're looking for the signs amen it's three minutes till midnight amen you lutherans ought to shout you Baptist and you Presbyterian watch the countdown of the word oh my they're headed to Heaven not the moon amen they'll pass the moon so fast they won't even see it waiting for that countdown waiting for the countdown that's right what are they doing they're wrapped in Christ in rapturing Grace nothing they did themselves how many believe that it's not what you did it's not what we do it's
