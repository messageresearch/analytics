we'll go to the psalms and we'll turn to psalms 5. psalms 5 there's 12 verses there give ear to my words o lord consider my meditation my voice shall thou hear in the morning o lord in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee and will look up the foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hate us all workers of iniquity but as for me i will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy and in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple for there is no faithfulness in their mouth their inward part is very wickedness their throat is an open sepulcher they flatter with their tongue but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice let them ever shout for joy because thou defendeth them let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee for thou lord will bless the righteous with favor without compass him as with a shield god bless you may be seated brother brian for sunday school the children can be dismissed for sunday school morning brothers and sisters if you return to the 90th psalm and also us if you want you can put an earmark on the sixth chapter of galatians you know i was thinking there this morning you're all brother tom's fishing yesterday i guess i wasn't there for that but you caught several fish and i was just thinking you're all here this morning and then that and that was in a natural sense but if you just think of it in a spiritual sense you know we're fishing in god's word for his promises and anything that god has in his word you're more than able to reach out in faith and reach for that promise that god has for you this morning whether it's spiritual healing whether it's physical healing whatever that need is i'm a firm believer that god is more than able to meet your needs this morning and you know the world wants you your enemy not so much the world your enemy wants you to look at the circumstances and not look at the promises when any time you get in the situation in your life you always find yourself there's an enemy trying to make you make look at your circumstances and then your circumstances become a wall that you can't climb over because you're focusing in the circumstance or whatever that might be and not in the promises that god provides for you as a believer you just got to reach out in faith just like you're fishing and you got to reach out you know send your faith out there catch it upon the waters and god is more than able to meet your need this morning and i don't know what that need is this morning only you know in your hearts what you need from god this morning but god is more than able to meet that need for you this morning i don't know well i'm going this way but sometimes we cut ourselves short you know god god always wants to do more for you than you reach out in faith for and sometimes we and what god really wants to do for you this morning but i was reading in this night and going back to that fifth psalm that we were reading here if you take the word of god it's continually it lays foundation upon foundation upon foundation and you know if you read that psalm the fifth psalm they talk about he prayed before you know he turned his heart to jerusalem or you think of or you think of jonah he you know he turned his heart toward jerusalem toward the temple and it goes all the way back to that prayer of solomon when solomon said if the children of israel got in trouble that they would if they would turn their hearts and their minds and their soul back and look to jerusalem to the temple and pray before the lord that god would heal him of their afflictions or the problems in their land looks no different for you this morning as a christian but it's in a different sense you're not looking to a physical place but you're looking to the word of god and jesus christ and the promise for the age that we live in this morning and if you in faith reach out using god's word and the promises and put them before you he'll meet that need for you this morning but i'm totally i was uh i don't read the wrong one that's the one it's the one for this morning but it's for the 12th and the scripture that this you know this guy probably when he wrote this devotional for world war ii that wrote this was probably 40 50 years old so he's not on the earth no more but when you look at the world that we're in this morning it's kind of you know they had a if you were a young man in 1941 or 1942 there was a lot of anxiety you know that was going to be on your heart no different than being a christian in the age that we're living right now you don't know what tomorrow's and and you read the psalms that when you read the psalms and you see how god thinks of people that try to subvert other people or steal from people or hurt people or lie to people i'll just read what he has to say it goes back to galatians the sixth chapter but before i read this let me i'm i'm totally off point this morning but if you turn with me to galatians sixth chapter you know i'm a firm believer in my own life you can't ever not you got constantly you've got to re-read the word of god because there's always like brother thomas says and all preachers will tell you you know you'll read a chapter in the bible or a message [Music] you know whatever message you'll read at one time you'll put it down for a few months or a few years and you'll lift it up again and you read it again and you get something different out of it it doesn't change the truth that's already in it it just adds to what you know already so when you read like galatians the six chapters in it you might read it three weeks ago or three months ago and you read it again and something else will reach out to you something you didn't see before will be there and that's that's really important but i'll just read what paul had to say here said brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault he which are spiritual restore such as one in the spirit of meekness consider taught these simple truths of life how you treat other people is how god's gonna treat you it's pretty simple the way you treat people the way you think about people the way you act around people you know you can't hide from god god knows who you are that's the same judgment you're going to receive one day yourself so you got to look inward and see what kind of purge that's the hardest thing for a human being is to really see themselves for how they really are you know there's a it's just one of the hardest things in life to really see yourself for who you are and he goes on to say here bear you one another's burdens so you fulfill the law of christ himself to be foreign when he is nothing he deceives himself and that i mean that's the world we live in people think of themselves more than they should but let every man prove his own words and then shall he be have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden you know people can help you carry your burden and lead you through life but in the end when you cross over you're gonna you're gonna bear whatever you are you're gonna bear it over to the other side whether it's good or bad you're gonna carry it with you whatever bag that you have on your heart and on your life you know like brother branham said the things you're gonna carry over are not physical things they're spiritual things whatever whatever you've done you're going to carry it over to the other side unless you've made it right and he goes on to say here so every man shall bear his own burden and it says let him that is taught in the communicate unto him that teaches and all good things and this devotion will go to this here this morning and be not deceived god is not mine whatsoever a man so if that shall he also reap and then i was reading this this morning and uh and then that's the scripture this man was dealing with and then he goes and it it's pretty true here what this guy has to say and this was in you know this was 1942 1943 then you have up to the year 2022. this is not a threat it's more than a promise it's a statement of principle it's not a threat you're going to reap what you sow it's not a threat it's a principle you know a lot of people will say god is threatening me if i don't do right he's going to judge me in the end no he's telling you what he's going to do and then you have to as principal act on it accordingly and this is a war that will not last forever and then this same thing whatever your life is wherever you're at in your life that situation is not going to last forever and it goes on but longer for sure most men who are in armed forces of america will presently be back in civilian life but forget about that just think of whatever circumstances you're in you know whatever job you're in whatever part of your life you're in sooner or later you you're gonna be back again and the world will reap the harvest of the war same thing as an individual you'll reap the harvest of your own actions believe it's no different than the man you work with or your neighbor they're no different also and he goes on but the one thing that makes a man better than a beast is his ability to look ahead to determine his conduct today on the basis of what is to be tomorrow next week next year a thousand years from now what he's basically saying today you should live today knowing that tomorrow whatever tomorrow's going to be be the same christian that you were today tomorrow and he goes on to say think of yourself in years that are to be cling to your faith as you will wish the later time that you would have done and that's the same principle for today if don't be willing to compromise for who you are to make someone happy once you do that one time the next day they're going to ask you to do it twice as much and the day after that they're going to ask you to do it three or four times once you compromise your integrity it's over they're just going to continue to have you compromise it cling to your faith as you would wish it in a later time that you had done resist temptation today in such a way that you can rejoice in your victories 10 years from now or life he didn't say that i added that keep yourself as clean as you would when you look into the eyes of your pure wife and better days than this and that's a pretty good principle for young men or old men or men my age you know everything you do you've got to go home one day and you have to look in your wife's eyes you have to look in your children's eyes and you have to you have to reckon within yourself everything you've done and he goes on to say all your life do you not curse but bless the man you're to be when when the war is over whatever your life is over i've taken a lot of time but the most important thing i can see is paul said in galatians don't be deceived who you are this morning how you came here this morning whatever when you're not here behind these walls or when you're not on when you're on the other side of these double doors when you come in that's who you really are when no one's looking in the way you like that's who you really are you can't you can't hide from yourself that's exactly who you are and if it's not message of the hours encouraging you to move ahead of that and be covered uh brother david amen it's just good to be in the house of the lord it's good to see each and every one out this morning and it's good to be home and man we just appreciate the lord this morning and and god is good isn't he amen let's sing that lol course if we could sister becky this is

soon as he calls because i don't travel a lot i don't get out a lot but i'll always say yes if i can help it all brother tom calls me so i always love being with you all good group this morning we couldn't have church amen so i thought brother troy read that out of psalms 5 and i thought i'd just reread verse 11. so psalms 5 verse 11. we'll just go into his word psalms 5 verse 11 as he read it this morning but just read that scripture there it says but let those that put their trust in thee rejoice who puts your trust in him everything going on in this world where else should we put our trust is in thee they rejoice let them that they let through i tell the kids all the time i tell the youth all the time you know the world is happy to let you know how converted they are the world is excited to let you know that i love a man or a woman loves a woman the world is excited to let you know how crazy they are about everything that is a perverted state why can't we be happy to let the world know what we believe amen he says and they he says and let them ever shout for joy because they're defended them he's always got our back let them also that love thy name be joyful unto thee be joyful unto thee forget your scripture we'll go to psalms 51. i'll let you have your seats after that if we could this morning i would title it coming out of psalms 51 restore unto me the joy of thy salvation 1962 in questions and answers read this right fast kind of got my thought when i started this a while back but he says whether i'm reading a question here and answering it he says i have lived this guy's brother's talking i've lived many years in sin until i found the lord he said please brother branham he says i have sinned again and i'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me i can be restored whole again brother brown says yes you have not sinned my friend so far in god that you could not be restored if you had sinned so far that you could not be restored you'd never want to be restored see but as long as there's something dealing with your heart you're still in line of resurrection he said now there's a place you can cross that you can't get back but you've got to go down here and again the same shape that you was it goes to show that you only fell from grace he said backsliding is not lost i want somebody to tell me where backsliding is lost and prove it in the bible a bachelor is not lost he's just out of fellowship israel black slid but they never lost their covenant they lost their praise and their joy david lost the joy of his salvation when he took the siba yuri's urethra's life but he never lost his salvation he never said restore unto me my salvation he said restore to me the joy of my salvation psalm 61 read it real quickly and let you be seated have mercy upon me o god according to thy loving kindness according to that multiple of the tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me fearfully for my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me and against thee the only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight thou mayest be justified when they're speakest and be clear when thy justice behold i was shapened in iniquity and sin did my mother conceive me behold their desires truth and my inward parts and the hidden parts that they shall make me to know wisdom purge me with herself and i shall be clean and wash me and i shall be wider than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that thy bones which there has broken may rejoice hide thy face for my sins and blot out my iniquities create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from my presence and take not thy holy spirit for me but restore unto me the joy of thy salvation heavenly father lord lord we love you this morning lord lord whirling full acknowledgement lord that without you we're nothing but lord with one word from you lord everything can be made well lord i asked you this morning lord to take every spirit and every thought that's not like you under your control lord drive it from the presence of this building lord give us freedom to have joy this morning lord give us freedom to worship your holy name lord lord move myself aside lord lord i am nothing lord i failed time and time again but with you on my side i can create i can do all things amen lord jesus be with us lord i pray say something lord to benefit your people in your lovely name we pray amen and amen and you can be seated and i thought of this and i thought you know we go through throw that down we go through life so many times and we allow the circumstances of our life get us unhappy we allow things to happen you know so many times if we're not careful we let the devil be victorious when he's not victorious he comes in our lives and he puts anything and everything before you to steal your joy why because if he can steal your joy and your happiness that he has stowed your life life is not worth living if you're not happy life is not worth living why does depression come on why does mental illnesses come on because they lose their joy they lose their satisfaction for living they lose their happiness for being alive they lose their joy for serving the lord and you see them backslide out into the world you see them go into all these spirits begin to take control why because they lost their joy because you know what you find the brother and sister that's happy and where they're at and you ain't got to worry about the devil winning their factory because they're going to win every battle why because they're satisfied and knowing the lord they serve is the lord that gives them happiness it's the lord that gives them the joy that they have and you know what we go through life and if not careful we allow the enemy to take our own lives away from us look as i said before i get so sick and tired of the world telling me how happy they are but i can't get a christian to tell me how happy they are well let me tell you something i'm happy this morning i'm happy that god took me from the world i'm happy that he took me from the perversion i'm happy that he opened my eyes to the message of this earth to let me see i am full of joy so how can you be happy living in the day because i know what my future holds i know where i'm going children of god this isn't my final resting place this isn't my destination he's going to conquer this world he's going to destroy every aspect of it and i'm going to come back and live with him forever and you know what there ain't gonna be no perversion over there there ain't gonna be no sicknesses over there there ain't gonna be no crying for sadness over there they're just gonna be tears of joy in our lives but you know i find this and and i read the quote there i read the scripture and i find the word restore is to bring back it is to bring it to a previous right or a practice or a condition or a situation or to reinstate one where they fell from and you realize before the foundation of the world you were children of god before the foundation of the world you was chosen to live in this age he's just putting you back in your place restore his bag lord restore that joy back look at david's condition in second samuel we'll we'll kind of hit this and i'll try to preach like an evangelist i'll get over the stuff and then we'll get happy okay but you know what there's a story in the bible for every situation we go through there's an example laid before us that we may see what is it that's filling my joy and i find this example in second second look before we read it remember david falls into a backslidden condition he chose to follow the desire of the flesh over the desire of god look he was a man after god's own heart i'm not speaking evil of david david was a man after god's own heart but he was a man and he had mistakes in his life children of god that should encourage us to know that though he was a man though he was chosen of god he made mistakes so are you and i we're men and women of god we're brothers and sisters of christ we are the pride of christ even though we make mistakes we are the pride of christ i was talking to a young person last night and they said you know i just don't understand because it just seems like every time i put one foot forward i fall back three feet and i said well that's a good sign why because we've heard it and heard it and heard it but let's take it to our hearts this morning if the enemy is fighting you it means you're on the opposite side it means you're in the right path what is this david he did he chose that why did he choose that he chose that for the desire of his flesh over the desire of god what did he choose he chose boshiba she was fair to look upon it pleased his flesh it brought happiness for a time and he chose because he knew that it was wrong look children of god let's just be real honest most of the things that we do we do knowing the wrong we've been raised around the message of the air we've been the church we've heard the word come forth we know right and wrong i'm not being illegal but we know what god wants and what he don't hold but yet we choose what we do david knew that it was not white to take a walk off of a off of a roof that was a wife to another man he knew that was not right but yet he he did it anyway that's what took his joy that's what took his happiness that's what the dissatisfication that's what took everything from him what was it he chose because he knew what he was what was right and wrong help us lord we make decisions every day and we know what's right and wrong when i was 12 13 years old brother carol used to tell people he said my little 12 13 year old could twist the minds the theologians and the baptists why because they have heard what is right and wrong we've been in this message too long we have heard this ministry preached too long we know the scripture too well we have the holy ghost that is leading us every day our life we know what's right and wrong but yeah we still choose look we do the same thing with our finances you know look he's making a thousand dollars a month should not have a 500 car payment but boy that car looks good but we know we're not going to be able to pay for it we know there's going to come a time we're not going to put the bill and they're going to come get the car but we got to look good for everybody around us like david david made a choice to make himself happy he made a choice that pleased his flesh he made a choice that went against what god wanted him to do but you know what he still come to church and sunday morning with his suit on he still had a smile on his face so you think joy is a smile no anybody can put a fake smile on you can put a suit on you become the church but on the inside of the inside you know where your joy is your pastor does do because you used to say amen and you don't know you used to raise your hand and you don't raise your head no more you used to be willing to sing but now you don't want to sing no more why because you've lost your joy for the word david lost his joy but he lost it because of what he did of what god did second samuel 11 we're going to read it and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time the kings go forth to battle david sent jacob and his servants with him in all of israel and they destroyed the children of amen and they be seized rabith but david tarried still in jerusalem what was it the first thing he got out of place he's a king he's supposed to go with his spoofs he's supposed to be in the forefront he's supposed to be leading his troops in the battle but yet he stayed home what happens to us so many times we know we're supposed to be at church but we stay home and instead of streaming we watch some video on youtube come on let's be honest it's dynasty this morning okay we're going to get somewhere we're going to get excited because god gave us a way out of this he knew what we would face he knew what we would go through he knew the battles that we would fight he knew the decisions that each and every one of us would make every day of our life but yet he gave us a way out and it came to pass in the evening time david arose from his bed and he walked upon the roofs of the king's house and then on the from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon what he wouldn't have seen her if he'd have been where he's supposed to be children of god if we were supposed to be most of our trials won't occur come on if you're at church on sunday morning you don't have to worry about what's playing on tv because you're a church hearing from god if you're in church on wednesday night you ain't got to worry about what the world's doing or what the news is doing because you're coming to the house of the lord to worship and praise your breaker but when you leave where you're supposed to be that's when the devil's going to come why because he's a good adversary he's a good enemy and he knows if he can get you to back up just a little bit he's going to attack what is it just in the in the common place of war when you know we he we made the devotion from world war ii but you know what when you're in battle and you're in one of the world wars korean war vietnam whatever it was the enemy is looking for you to step back because if they can ever get that enemy to step back that's when they're going to full charge because they've said they've noticed that that you you know you're losing your footing that you're the enemy is losing their footing and they're trying to retreat to find a better place and that's the best time to attack oh the devil knows the same thing when he gets you to miss one service he's coming when he gets you to miss one prayer meeting he's coming when he gets you not to read your devotion one morning he's coming why because he sees you're retreating to what you say you believe and he's coming he's coming for everything that you are what is it he said he goes on that he says and it came to pass he said and then in david terry still in jerusalem and it came to pass in the evening time that david arose from his bed he's seen a shiva and david seen and inquired after this woman and he said it's not this placebo the daughter of them the ivy right of the hittites and david sent messages and took her and she came unto him and he left for she was purified from her tongue to her and cleanliness and she returned to her house and the woman conceived and sent until david said i am with child see now david loses joy because now david knows he's done something and now there's a consequence coming behind it come on children of god when do we lose our joy when we realize that we've made a mistake and there's a consequence coming behind it you see all of these professional athletes give these these written statements of apology there's no apology in that you can read a written statement all day long but you know what you hit a real christian you hit a real child of god on the inside of the inside where it hurts and they lose their joy because they know what they did is wrong what is it so many times the things that get us in the most trouble is the choices we make look i'd love to live in a society that god had done predestinated for ordained he did predestinate for a day but that i would never make a mistake he didn't do that he just knew that i'd always turn back to him he just knew that every time david made a mistake david would turn back to his word and say god forgive me for my iniquities this isn't who i really desire to be but what was it we if we read on down second chapter uh second and same new verse 11 and verse 27 23 says in the messengers i look we skipped a little bit david is now going to make it right oh come on church how many times we do something wrong and we're going to make it right we can't make it god's the only one that can make it right making it right didn't bring we're going to read it but making it right and bring happiness and joy back to david david thought you know what if i could just cover this up come on if i could just get a good quote to justify what i'm doing it'll be okay no it won't be because on the inside of the inside is a predestinated seat of god and it knows the truth and it's not putting up with anything else but david thought you know what i could cover this up i'm the king everybody respects me i can make this go away i'll just have your eye killed and then i'll marry her and nobody will think nothing about it so what does he do he goes in the scripture and he sends your eye out in the very front you know what i always say he sent you out with the note that was going to kill him brother branham said in one place your eye was closer to god than brother than david on children of god what is it that's my desire in my heart god whatever you want me to do let me do it but see david was trying to cover it up and so he went out and he got killed in verse 23 it says in the messenger said unto david surely the man prevailed against us and he came back under this field and we were upon and even and then near the gates and the shooters shot from authority from the wall upon that servants some of the king's servants be dead and thy servant you had the hittite is dead also you know what i get from that scripture david was okay with losing some of his generals as long as your eye went down too come on children of god 2022 there's some believers it's okay if it takes some other families out just as long as it gets the one they don't like they're willing to sacrifice half the church they're willing to sacrifice half of their own family just to cover their own sin come on i told you to be rough we'll get through this come on how do you know i'm there because i'm there because i'm human i live in 2022. i don't i don't go live on a cloud somewhere where there ain't no battles i go to work five days a week i deal with people i deal with young people i talk to young people i know what they're going through what is it we're living in a day that the battle is stronger than it's ever been the devil is at your footsteps he is at your door he is in your mind he is trying to tell you to do things wrong and then david said unto the messenger thus shall there say unto job let not this thing displease thee for the sword divine earth one as well as another and make that battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage them well it's pretty don't take this wrong but that's a pretty sad picture of david that david's excited that he lost some men come on the children of god we should never be excited to lose one we have one walk out of the church we ought to go to our knees and fast and pray for them i don't care what that old kids you've heard of i don't care if the pastor's heard i don't care if they've got every pet peeve in the world against the church if one walks out of this congregation it should drive the rest of the church to inhale to the fast to bring that one so back but he was happy that he lost some men because he lost your eye you know what he said he said that scripture would say what he was going down he said they started saying to joke let not this displease you so now he's using his power of influence to encourage everybody that it's okay come on they do it all around the message they name drop like crazy well brother so-and-so said it's okay so you have to believe it no i ain't my my life and my word is not based upon brother so and so my life and my word and my revelation is based upon god almighty and if he's not happy i'm not happy i don't care who's happy maybe that's why i don't go out and preach because i ain't popular but you know what i don't care the word of god was displeased with what david said done let's finish reading that he says and the wife of and when the wife has you i've heard that iran who hurt her uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husband and when the morning was passed david sent and fetched her to his house and she became his wife and bear his son and everybody lives happy ever after no the scripture says but the thing that david had done displeased the lord he wasn't happy with david's decision he gave david a choice to choose him or his flesh david had chosen rome but you know what didn't matter how displeased god was with him he was still david he was still called the king of god's people he was still looked upon by god as a man after his own hearts and you know what it don't matter how many times you make the wrong decision it don't matter how many times the devil tries to steal everything your joy your happiness your revelation everything that you have he can't take you from the hand of god jesus through there says all that he gave me is in my head i shall not lose a one what is he saying he says i don't care what you've done you can come back to this joy you can come back to this happiness because you are a child of god they say once this thing happens david's joy leaves him david knows in his heart what he's done david knows what he's done is wrong but he puts on a sunday morning she puts on a suit of clothes and he comes into his kingship and he says everybody all it's okay god's in this no god ain't in this it decreased god but in his heart he knew he wasn't right you know what second samuel 12 then nathan confronts david why do we need a prophet in this day to confront us why do we need to listen to the messages in this day to be confronted by his word why do we come to church and have a pastor to be confronted with his word when we make decisions that ain't the best decisions in the world when we start wandering away from what god called us to be that's what god sent a pastor to do is to reach out and say open your eyes look back at the word bring you back into fellowship thank you back in the fellowship look one night when nathan would confront the prophet of that day he would confront david of his backslidden condition david finally confesses second samuel 12 but look worst see without joy you know what you know you know what the lack of joy brings anger because if i ain't happy you can't be happy come on come on if i ain't happy ain't nobody in the dirt's gonna be happy just look you know it ain't my problem that you made the wrong choice and you can't get back to god because i don't got back to god and he's done got his hand reached out and he's then asking you to come back in the fellowship he's asking you to restore your joy what is it anger comes back and you become critical how many knows them see when i said it every one of you and you thought of somebody pray it wasn't nobody in here when they lose their joy they become critical they begin to look at your life and they go oh wow see i seen him slip up at the 7-eleven the other day come on i said you know what he that brother used to say amen 17 times and now he says it two times see he's backslid on god you know that's the greatest defensive mechanism that we got is to tell other people i used to say all right i don't used to i still say in the business world when we're doing business deals and everything if i have someone come to me and they begin to downgrade somebody else i'm done with them i'm done with them because if you're so low in your confidence that you have to cut everybody around you down to make yourself feel superior you're the issue come on you're the issue you know what i don't believe in cutting people down they've been lifting people up i believe in taking people that i may not even agree with and placing them up above me and saying god use them for your service but use them in your life they become legalistic what's the second samuel 12. almost through the rough part second sabbath 21 david's anger was greatly kindled against the man against what man the prophet come on the day we're living and how many people is greatly angled against the prophet they don't want to hear all that he said they just want to hear what they like what he said they want to splice the tapes up they want to listen to the tape they want to listen to i want to listen to all the tapes because if he's got something to correct me i want to be corrected and david's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said unto nathan as the lord liveth the man that had done this should surely die what is he doing look look we just script scripture i'm sorry but we looked at the scripture we find that nathan gives him an example of what david did and david's ready to kill him and he said he said and have done this thing he said surely die and he said restore the lamb for fold because he did this thing and because he had no pity well he's all legalistic now and well he let them people know they don't left god they don't they deserve to die about half the people want a message come on look what you don't believe it the way i believe it so you just don't believe the message no i believe the message is god has given a prophet to speak a message under my heart and as he is revealed upon his knowledge and his good term to open the revelation in my heart that i can see what the prophet said know what you said but what god said and nathan said unto david thou art that man thus saith the lord god of israel i anointed the king over israel i delivered thee out of the hand of saul i gave thee to thy master's house that master's wives into thy bosom i gave to the house of israel to judah and into that and if that had been too little i would more ever give it unto thee such and such things come on you know what i hear when i read that scripture i hear god saying jonathan i have given you everything that you have need of in this day i have given you salvation of your sins i have given you forgiveness of you all of your sins and iniquities forgiven you i have been i have given you the power to be in a rhetoric right i have given you everything and if there would have been enough how to get any more wherefore there has despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight and there has killed he arrived the hittite by the sword and has taken his wife and i slain him with the sword what was it it thought he had a good cover-up going on but you don't cover nothing up from god look when your pastor gets up here and he preaches something and you think that he's been reading your text he about but god laid it on his heart to go right down that alley thank god for a prophet thank god for for a five-fold ministry in this day that'll yield themselves to god and come right to where i live and say this is what you've been talking about see this is you david i know the real truth it lingers with us it won't go away it steals our boy like it did david's but it always guides us back to the word it always guides us back to his word no wonder god could say david you're a man after my own heart because even when you think you had the greatest cover-up in the world when i sent a prophet to unveil the truth you went through your knees repenting because you knew god knew brother branham in the innerval in 1956 he says i said i'm a leaf i said smoking cigarettes and drink you're saying and running around with this is this very symptom it's the attributes of your unbelief i said you do not believe he says you do not because you don't believe jesus jesus says he that hears my words and believeth on him that sent me have everlasting life brother birmingham says when you say you're a believer and you do that it shows that something's wrong you don't believe get out like you believe you're taking reasonings and and not taking your soul's conviction because your soul is part of god that it's in you and it'll agree with the god's word it would just take out your intellectual your thinking what is he conviction does is good come on it brings us back to joy you don't have joy this morning find what it is that you backed up from god look it may not have been a great sin it may not have been adultery it may it may not have been murder it may not have been but what was it but it goes on down he says and he has to pass that away says and know that conviction can make you very restless it does that it's our good praying wife or mother can do more for the kingdom of god on our knees what is it it makes you restless it makes you unhappy it makes you not want to go to church it makes you not want to fellowship with brothers and sisters because there's something telling you their joy is gone and you're putting a faith on but god gives us a way back what is it doing we read psalms 51 but psalms 32 is it's david leading up into what he was actually filling in the 52 he's crying out to god see that's what we need to do is we need to cry out to god we need to cry out to god for god restore the joy of my salvation let me realize i need more joy now than i've ever had you say oh but i'm born again living right but i still need more joy i need happiness i need the ability to put a smile on my face without trying to and saying god i love you as far as i know my heart is clear and my heart is clean what was it he said it inverted no jeremiah 29 11 the scripture says well i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end see these are the promises i look at because you know what they're the ones that make me happy david wanting us to be he's crying out to god to restore the joy of the salvation he says what does he do he goes back to the word and he begins to see what was it and david when david would come and and then and saul was after his life and he was hiding away in another country and david was fighting the fight and he come home and all of his women and all of his lives all of his children was gone right he says you know what i've done something wrong what did he do the scripture says he went and encouraged himself what does the scripture say that he did he went and took the press plate and put it on what was the breath right there you're on thermal brother brother and said this word is our you're on tumblr today when you need to go back and encourage yourself go back to the word and find out god you're the joy giver you're the happiness giver you're the salvation giver you're the healer of almighty season you are that one i placed it before me more than anything that i have in romans 8 28 says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are called according to his purpose do you believe you're called according to his purpose so everything that happens happens for a reason well i've heard that a thousand times we'll let it sink into your heart grab a hold of it and believe it like you've never believed it before when you go through a battle realize that is god proving you that is god training you that is god molding you to be an overcomer in this day you take a truth in the battlefield that never went to boot camp how do you think that'd make it come on the last thing we would want as a country is a bunch of young men that had never trained that never tried to should never been taught how to shoot a gun and we send them over to find a battle for us they could be completely lost they'd be overtaken our country would be defeated but you know what you what would you take with a christian that don't stay in training for god that don't stay happy before the lord reading his word reading the message what is it they're going to be overcome but god thank you so much philippians 1 6 says being confident in this very thing that we shared again a good work in you we'll perform it until the day of jesus christ he started this work in you he's going to finish this work in you he gave you joy and unprecedent he gave you happiness he's there to give it back to you if you just call out for it you say well why'd you think of this because i'm living in a day that i'm watching a christian people abroad around this world that's being forsaken and downtrodden and pushed down to no end but you know what she should be the happiest people alive come on i don't know how the world goes through the things they go through without a god on their side i don't know how the world goes through what they go through without a comforter the way my comforter is i don't know how they make decisions in life without a guide that he is to me i don't know how they go through sicknesses without knowing there's a healer that is in my life that can heal me from all of my diseases no wonder kobe drove people crazy could you imagine some of us has been through it if you didn't have god to fall back on no wonder it sent them insane because there's nothing they could do to come against it but i could i fall back on my knees and say god i am happy in your word i am happy in your message you said whatever sickness i have you could be that healer he's wanting us to be more happy today you know the biggest lie of the devil is to come in and tell you oh you've got to live such a holy restricted life that you can't be happy that's a lie if you can't be happy that means you're putting it on because if you ever get it on the real inside of the inside it makes you happy to live for god it's not a depression state it's not a it's not a burden to dress like a woman it's not a burden to act like a man there's something that excites you on the inside said let me show the world exactly my god is still alive psalms 32 ends with rejoice in the lord and be glad you righteous seeing all that you are upright in hearts david pleads with god to restore god restores it to david god looks at it and says no matter what you've done i'll forgive you and wash your sins from the world no one to know what the devil will bring it up what he does to us come on we ask for forgiveness we ask for something in our lives and we ask god to forgive us the devil brings it up every morning when we wake up you know what you did yesterday you know what you did last week you know what you did to that brother last month but you know what god has forgiven me of the devil you're the only one that remembers it there's a joy that is restored back in my heart joe 23 6 says will he plead again with me with great power no but he would put strength in me see when he restores your joy back he places a little more strength he places a little more character he gives the ability for the next time that david's gets out of the wheel when he sees another besheba he knows to turn his head and walk away come on he gives us the strength that the next time we click on a little video that we shouldn't be watching we turn our head and we hit the little x why because there's something in us that god has already used us to overcome that in our life i'm not going to fall for it again i'm not there's a joy inside of me james 1 2-4 says my brethren counting all joy when you fall in the diverse diverse temptations knowing this that the trying in your face work with patience but let patience have a perfect word that you may be perfect and entire warning nothing can we can we slow down just a second and thinking yourself nobody has to say it think in your mind in years ago a trial that you was going through what is it now it's nothing five years ago a sickness that you was in what is it now it's nothing come on a month ago something in your family going on that you just thought was the end of the only since where is it now it's gone why because we serve a god that is in control of all things and the biggest thing that you have going on in your life right now three months from now you won't even think about it why because you've overcome it you've walked it on top of it and you counted it as joy what it is restoring to the georgia and david when he's restored david changed his reading of the word he changed how he said what is it then you go to romans you find romans 8 says nay and all these things we are more than that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angers nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor heights nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is christ jesus our lord look let's look at your life let's look at your own personal life for a minute and think everything the devil's brought you through he hasn't succeeded yet oh he caused me to fall but he didn't take me from god he caused you to make a mistake but he didn't take me from the love of god because he loves me forever he loves me nothing can separate us you know when we're in the deepest darkest moment as david was an example we need to look back to him and realize that he's not a father that just loves us when we do good but we have many parents here we love our kids no matter what they do they can make the biggest mistake in the world and mama and daddy still love them that's how my father is he looks down at the church and he says you're my brother it doesn't matter what you do i love you and there's something that's going to bring you back to this restoration of joy but is it in the message why brother says now 1961 he says now if you say lord i lost the joy of my salvation but one's given us a way out he says if i he said say unto the lord i've lost the joy of my salvation i want you lord i've lost the joy in my salvation and so the first thing we do is think well that's not me because i hadn't committed adultery i hadn't killed nobody i had none no it could be the smallest or smallest now if you say lord i've lost the joy of my salvation i want you i'm sorry i stayed away from prayer meeting wednesday night we'll find me right back there next wednesday night i'll be right back all right the believer says i'm confessing i'm wrong despite what he tried not to fight david trying to suppress it his joy did not return until he was honest with himself you put a smile on you can come to church but until you can get real with yourself you won't receive your joy back because only you and god knows the real you only you and god knows oh and down in the message why brother broom says now i've grieved that spirit somewhere he said if you've grieved that spirit somewhere then go right back and think in your mind what did i start doing neglecting church did i start fussing with another denomination i don't know what it is in message people they want to fight with everybody in the world this message wasn't given to be a discussion and and enough to be on public tv and have a debate over without this this message was given to those that believe can receive in their heart he says what is it he said i started the naked church did i start fussing with another nomination did i start picking on this one oh god help us hey so many great bigs then just a little thing did i start picking on this one doing this to my neighbor if you did that's what sapped it out say oh god say god i'm sorry i will go right back and make that thing right i will go right and do it and then the joy will come back to your salvation again the holy spirit just flew right up there on the rafter he's ready to fly right back down again anytime you win he says you want him to come back he does the leading that is our promise galatians 5 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law the father of christ has crucified the flesh with the affections of the lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit if joy is a promise to me i'm going to be happy y'all get accused too much of being too happy maybe we all should be accused too much of being too happy they tell me all the time with the word how are you so happy because i know my end point i ain't looking at the current circumstances i ain't looking at the battles that i'm in i know where i'm going do you know where you're going why i don't know what that means where you don't know where you're going then if you get a hold of the same god that i get out of and you know where you're going it changes the innermost being about you i can be happy living in 2022 as the world's fallen apart why because i don't get nervous when they say russia is attacking ukrainian going for the o i say praise the lord it's about time to go home it excites me to see the revelation and the prophecy of the scripture completely being fulfilled before my eyes oh you never say look i'm sorry i don't know why we got there i hope you wanted you ain't in this boat but i ain't never seen the lack of massive believers on facebook all worried about what's going on in russia have you not listened to the message he told us that in 63 they was coming for ukraine he told us that they was coming for the oil he also told us in the spirit sense that the denomination was coming for you all because you're the only ones got what it takes to get out of here that ought to make us happy if nothing else does what is it i like the scripture in exodus 22. that's exodus 22 talks about judgments and rights of property in the law but i like what this scripture says it says if the he said if the thief be certainly found in the hand of life whether it be an oxen ass or a sheep what did he say if the thief is caught that stole something from you our kentucky tennessee language right if somebody comes stowed from you and they prove that it was them what shall they do he shall restore devil so that enemy comes stowed that joy from you he's gonna have to give it back to you he's gonna have to give it back to your double he's gonna have to put up you more than he's ever put up with you because now you're gonna look at him in the face and say yeah devil you tried that once but i overcome so let me show you something now i'm going to fight a little harder i'm going to kick you a little stronger i want to stand a little longer why because you've already tried it and i've already been an overcomer i've already searched for you believe jesus in 1960 he says now i he says believe that the scriptures whether it says i believe that the scriptures cannot tell anything that's wrong you believe that there's many things in the scripture that i only wish i was able with faith enough to make it make it real to the people that was that's your prophet speaking he said but i never stand in the way of anybody that could do it come on we got people around this world that claims they believe this message that tells you well if i can't do it you can't do it you ain't listening to the message are you brother brendon says if i couldn't do it i wouldn't stop somebody else's hood if i couldn't heal a person i wouldn't stop another preacher from doing it if i couldn't bring a soul to an altar i wouldn't stop somebody else from doing it it don't have to be me it's god working through me it's god working through a ministry to bring in the tradition well you go to my camp and we're going to have 150 000 people in the altar but are they going to stay i'd rather god get out of one and bring him to him and change his eternal destination then have all the weeping and crying because if there ain't something behind it it'll never last my brother brendan talked about billy graham so many times if we're not careful we repeat that i'll move on but i'd never stand in the way of anybody that could do it if i couldn't take a walk like enoch did one afternoon with the lord and just let go so overjoyed till i just walk up home with him so overjoyed i like that whether we're going to put that in there at the enoch enoch was just happy enoch was running down through there clicking the hills he was just happy in the lord the god that the god of this universe had done showed him he's fixed death ain't nobody in the history and ain't nobody ever done this but he knocked i'm fixing to bring you on up a little higher he just got beside himself he was so happy he didn't worry about what the naysayers were saying he didn't worry about what the tomato throwers were saying he didn't worry about what the internet was saying he didn't worry about what social media was saying he didn't worry about what his family was saying he just got over jordan got beside himself he got so caught up with god god said just slide on up buddy he just slid on up and brother brown was telling this right there he says if i couldn't do it i wouldn't stop him from doing it why because he knew there's coming a day that we're living in that there's a bride of christ that's going to have the restoration of that joy to what they're going to be so happy they're just going to get caught up with him one day and just walk right on out of here he knew it was coming and like afternoon he said to the lord just go over joy till i just walk up home with him i wouldn't stand in anybody's way that did not have as much faith they could just walk up home with him without dying or tasting death of this world he says and we're trying today he's so see he said the end time is approaching there should be an end time appearing of the lord jesus he predicted in the scripture because what he said must come to pass you know what i think we need to start getting happy yeah i think joy needs to start running our lives i don't think we need to let the devil fear us anymore place fear in our lives that we can't worship him then we can't think hey look we took the youth last year last fall we took them to dollywood everybody else is shouting and hollering for their ball team shipping and hauling for their sexual desires shouting and hauling for everything else and so i just started shouting giving god the glory not on the eagle going across the thing some of them looked at me and i said hey look y'all can be heavy watch your head i got a happy one i got one of these days they ain't going to take this eagle strap to hold me up i'm just going to leave right on out of here why because there's a joy inside of me that i be with where i stand and i'm going to let the world know there ain't no joy like the joy i got there ain't no joy like the joy that the bride's got tonight why because she's firm foundation in the word of god and she knows there's a rapture approaching 1960 god's rap gift another thing i want to hear right here he says and when they see the light he's talking about the they're seeing the light when jesus was born that's what he says and when they sing the light was they ever happy come on come on we talked about wise man you know hearts thinking field look they didn't have these seeds back then to go cool off they'd been sweating for months they didn't have degree in secret like we got it wasn't a good smell come on but they had been told that there was a messiah coming and when that messiah was to come there would be a star that would hang over his birth you know it was probably the hardest day any one of them had everything that went wrong the sheeps wouldn't listen come on felt like they was a failure one of them looked up and said hey look at that star you know what that means and they begin to sound they begin to dance they begin to celebrate it says and when they seen the light they was ever so happy the bible said they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy they did a little dance they wasn't afraid to raise their hand and say thank you lord their smile come across the face that that thing tried to put there they begin to shout the oracles of god saying this is the day that you promised us little bride what's it gonna take for us this is the day that he promised us he promised us a day that the world would be so perverted it would go totally insane where are we at somebody was telling me the other day they was trying to pass something in one of the states that they want to make an elephant a human being now because he has feelings come on people this world's gone totally insane it's gone totally insane but yet we've got a message that told us this was gonna happen and so when's the bride gonna start shouting for joy when is that over exceedingly abundantly joy gonna rush into the bride and he's gonna go there it is that's what god promised that's what he said was going to be in the end time that's what he said was going to take place in my lifetime but you know what he said shortly after that he's calling me out here there's a child in my soul knowing i don't have to put up with this much longer i said oh imagine they shouted a little bit don't you imagine so amen i just imagine so so when they seen they had been an old organ in the station so long back there trying to find something that wasn't there he says when they get outside that gate and they've seen that holy ghost light shining up yonder the star of glory pulling down upon him they got so happy they had exceedingly great joy oh what does a person do when they get so overjoyed oh y'all ready for this what do you do at a ball game when they get overjoyed oh you holler hooray hurray bimbity bam whatever
