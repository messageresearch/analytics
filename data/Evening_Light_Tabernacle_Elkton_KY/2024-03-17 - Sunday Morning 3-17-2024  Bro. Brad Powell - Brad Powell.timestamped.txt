[25:57] good morning
[25:59] if we all would just stand and the
[26:00] children can be dismissed for Sunday
[26:04] school brother Tommy would you open us
[26:06] up in a word of
[26:07] [Music]
[26:27] Prayer
[26:33] so we pray speak to our hearts
[26:57] and amen amen if we would turn to 2
[27:00] Corinthians the 4th
[27:22] chapter therefore seeing we have this
[27:25] ministry as we have received Mercy we
[27:28] faint
[27:43] not but if our gospel be hid it is hid
[27:47] to them that are
[27:57] lost
[27:59] [Music]
[28:02] for we preach not ourselves but Christ
[28:04] Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[28:06] servants for jesus'
[28:19] sake but we have this treasure in Earth
[28:21] and vessel that the Excellency of the
[28:24] power may be of God and not of
[28:27] us
[28:33] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[28:36] but not
[28:46] destroyed for we which live are always
[28:49] delivered unto death for jesus' sake
[28:51] that the life also of Jesus might be
[28:53] made manifest in our mortal
[28:57] flesh
[29:01] we having the same Spirit of Faith
[29:03] according as as it is written I believe
[29:06] and therefore have I spoken we also
[29:09] believe and therefore
[29:19] speak for for all things are for your
[29:23] sakes that the abundance that the
[29:25] abundant grace might through the
[29:27] Thanksgiving
[29:29] many read down to the glory of
[29:36] [Music]
[29:40] God for our light Affliction which is
[29:43] but for a moment worketh for us a far
[29:45] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[29:48] Glory while we look not at the things
[29:51] which are seen but the things which are
[29:53] not seen for the things which are seen
[29:56] are temporal but the things which are
[29:58] not seeing our Eternal brother
[30:10] Troy good morning brothers and
[30:16] sisters all
[30:26] right well trying to get a little
[30:29] something together for Sunday school and
[30:31] of course how things go it seems like
[30:33] things always are struggle or things try
[30:36] to tend to go
[30:38] wrong but as brother Steve said that's
[30:41] that's how it goes that's life and then
[30:44] in ourselves if it was in ourselves we
[30:47] we wouldn't make it but it's not in
[30:48] ourselves to do it he said that he'd be
[30:50] with us even in us till the end of the
[30:52] world and and that's what we rest on but
[30:56] uh I had kind of a just
[30:59] a pull together just a a couple uh
[31:01] little things just a couple scriptures
[31:03] and then uh I was listening to brother
[31:07] brandom and I thought it'd kind of be
[31:09] neat because he goes over so many
[31:11] questions and answers actually we
[31:13] listening to One of brother Billy Paul's
[31:15] questions and answers that he did so
[31:17] many years ago and uh and it was to
[31:20] directed or towards kids but I thought
[31:23] that was really uh nice sometimes you
[31:26] have questions and so I just picked out
[31:29] uh couple questions here that brother
[31:30] brandham had went over and uh I thought
[31:33] we'd go over those so in the
[31:36] scripture uh it was Romans pertain to
[31:40] this one here Romans I think it's four
[31:44] let me see
[31:45] here of course like I said when uh when
[31:50] uh you think things are going to work
[31:51] out for you sometimes it don't work out
[31:53] like like we plann them to work out uh
[31:57] the pr
[31:58] it works really good when the kids are
[32:01] printing pictures to color but then this
[32:03] morning it didn't work and Robin was
[32:05] bragging about the printer she said it's
[32:07] a really good printer well this morning
[32:09] it doesn't print from my phone so I have
[32:11] to send it to Robin's phone then then I
[32:15] start printing it then the first page is
[32:16] folded then it jams and you can't of
[32:19] course I never messed with this printer
[32:21] so then you got to get all the back off
[32:23] or whatever to get the jam out but
[32:25] anyway it did work out but it's just how
[32:27] things like to go especially on Sunday
[32:30] mornings sometimes but you know uh if we
[32:34] brother Brandon said if we wouldn't have
[32:35] these issues come up what would be the
[32:37] you know the reward so we we have to
[32:39] push through the things that come up and
[32:41] and keep moving on but uh let's see
[32:45] Romans me make sure
[32:49] here I think
[32:51] it's it's Romans
[32:56] 46
[32:59] and and Paul says in here therefore it
[33:00] is of faith that it might be grace to
[33:03] the end the promise might be sure to all
[33:06] the seed to all the seed not to that
[33:10] only which is of the law but to all that
[33:12] also which is of the faith of Abraham
[33:14] who is the father of us all is as it is
[33:18] written I have made thee a father of
[33:19] many nations for before him whom even
[33:24] God who Quicken the dead and calleth
[33:26] those things which be not as though they
[33:28] were who against hope believed in hope
[33:31] that he might become the father of many
[33:32] nations according to that which was
[33:34] spoken so shall thy seed be and being
[33:37] not weak in faith he considered not his
[33:39] own body now dead when he was about 100
[33:42] years old neither yet the deadness he
[33:45] staggered not at the promise of God
[33:47] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[33:50] giving glory to God and being fully
[33:52] persuaded that he had that what he had
[33:55] promised he was able also
[33:59] it was imputed to him for righteousness
[34:02] now it was not
[34:04] written that it was imputed to him but
[34:07] for us also to whom it shall be imputed
[34:10] if we believe on him that raised up
[34:12] Jesus our lord from the dead who was
[34:14] delivered for our offenses and was
[34:16] raised again to our
[34:20] justification let's has this question
[34:22] here simple little question but a
[34:25] helpful question as we go through life
[34:27] brother BR he this person says please
[34:29] explain to how a person knows if he is
[34:32] thinking his own thoughts or if the
[34:34] devil is placing thoughts in his mind to
[34:36] make make him think wrong especially if
[34:40] you know you do not want to think
[34:43] them then if it brother R says then if
[34:46] it's contrary to the word it's the
[34:47] devil's thinking if it's w if it's with
[34:50] the word it's God's thinking if it's the
[34:53] wrong thoughts it's the devil if it's
[34:55] good thoughts of the word and of God
[34:58] it's God's thinking if the case may be
[35:01] that the devil is placing thoughts in
[35:02] your mind about a certain thing how may
[35:04] it how may it be overcome or got rid of
[35:08] brother Bren says take the vice very
[35:11] vice versa from it if the devil makes
[35:14] you think that uh you are if you know
[35:17] you're a Christian if the devil makes
[35:19] you think that you that you are if you
[35:21] know you're a Christian and he tries to
[35:22] make you think you're not a Christian he
[35:24] says just take the vice
[35:26] versa and say I am a Christian as long
[35:29] as your experience matches in God's word
[35:31] says say I am a Christian anything else
[35:34] the same way when you answer this please
[35:37] pray the man says when you answer this
[35:38] or the person uh please pray for me to
[35:41] overcome this as I'm am not by
[35:45] myself and brother BR says God grant you
[35:48] overcoming ever who you are may your
[35:50] thoughts just go right back to the other
[35:52] side and say I am a Christian I am a
[35:54] believer Satan you have no hold on me
[35:57] and then I thought this was interesting
[35:59] brother Brenham says here frankly he
[36:01] says I'm standing right here now saying
[36:03] the same thing keep me from fainting
[36:05] right here at the pulpit that's right
[36:08] four or five times I've almost pitched
[36:09] over on the pulpit that's the truth God
[36:12] knows that's
[36:13] right when a person
[36:16] realizes
[36:17] so that's brother Brenham then saying
[36:19] about what he's going through uh and
[36:23] that's so true uh we have to put as
[36:26] Believers you have to learn how to push
[36:28] through different things but uh and what
[36:31] an example brother Brenham
[36:33] was and that's with healing or anything
[36:35] that you have in your life so the person
[36:37] goes on and to say when a person
[36:38] realizes he has an inferior complex or
[36:40] some sort of complex how may he overcome
[36:42] this so should it be if he was the only
[36:44] child causes uh in his youth maybe early
[36:48] he says take exactly the opposite if
[36:49] you're always wait want wanting your way
[36:52] and that one little brat that wants to
[36:54] always have everything your way turn
[36:56] right back and around and give
[36:57] everything you got the other way if
[37:00] you're selfish and you want to hold
[37:02] everything then start giving away what
[37:04] you got see do whatever just go the vice
[37:07] versa that's the way to overcome
[37:09] anything it is an
[37:12] antidote you've uh my old southern mom
[37:15] mother used to say hair off the dog back
[37:17] is good for the bite and that applies
[37:20] this way too then he goes on to say
[37:22] brother random what achievement should
[37:24] we let our okay this is a different one
[37:26] here and then I was going to read this
[37:28] this uh verse to go with
[37:31] it I
[37:41] think
[37:46] good all right so uh and this is James 3
[37:49] we're going to James 3 you can go with
[37:51] her if you want
[37:53] but you don't have to if you don't want
[37:59] says starting in verse three my brethren
[38:02] be not many Masters knowing that we
[38:03] shall receive the greater condemnation
[38:05] for in many things we offend all If any
[38:08] man offend not in word the same as
[38:10] perfect man enable also to Bridle the
[38:12] whole body behold we put bits in the H's
[38:15] mouths that they may obey us and we turn
[38:18] about their whole body behold also the
[38:20] ships which though they be so great and
[38:23] are driven by of fierce winds yet are
[38:25] they turned about with a very small hand
[38:28] whatsoever the governor listeth even so
[38:31] the tongue is a little member and
[38:32] boasteth great things behold how great a
[38:34] matter a little fire kindleth and the
[38:37] tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so
[38:40] is the tongue among our members that it
[38:42] defile the whole body and Seth on fire
[38:45] the course of Nature and it is set on
[38:46] fire of hell for every kind of Beast and
[38:50] of birds and of serpents and of things
[38:51] in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed
[38:53] of
[38:56] mankind
[38:58] but the tongue can no man tame it is an
[39:00] unruly evil full of deadly poison
[39:03] therewith bless we God even the father
[39:06] and therewith curse We Men which are
[39:07] made after the similitude of God out of
[39:10] the same mouth proceedeth blessings and
[39:12] cursing my brethren these things ought
[39:14] not to be so do the fountain send forth
[39:17] of the same place Sweet Water and bitter
[39:20] can the Fig Tree my brethren bear allive
[39:22] berries either of Vine figs so
[39:25] can no both yield salt water and fresh
[39:30] who is the wise men and endued with
[39:32] knowledge among you let him show out of
[39:33] a good conversation as works with
[39:35] meekness of
[39:36] wisdom but if you have bitter envying
[39:38] and strife in your hearts Glory not and
[39:40] lie not against the truth this wisdom
[39:43] descendeth not from above but is Earthly
[39:45] sensual devilish for where envying and
[39:48] strife is there is confusion in every
[39:50] evil work but the wisdom that is from
[39:53] above is first pure then Peaceable
[39:56] gentle and easy to be treated full of
[39:58] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[40:00] and without hypocrisy the fruit of
[40:03] righteousness is swn in peace of them
[40:04] that make
[40:07] peace then the question comes up brother
[40:09] Brandon when some of someone gets on me
[40:12] or steps on my toes this might be a good
[40:14] one steps on my toes as the old saying
[40:18] goes my temper Rises how can I overcome
[40:21] this thing I know the Lord will have to
[40:23] do it but what can I do in my heart I
[40:26] don't want this thing
[40:28] brother venam says sweeten your temper
[40:29] with prayer then make up your mind there
[40:33] I don't guess there's too many people in
[40:34] this building ever had any more temper
[40:37] than I did begin with he said I had a
[40:39] mouth that was mashed all the time taken
[40:42] a lot of my meals out of a straw my
[40:44] mother as you know was a half Indian my
[40:47] father was Irishman a Kentucky Irishman
[40:49] at that and everyone both of them had
[40:51] enough temper to fight a buz saw all the
[40:53] time my mouth was mashed I was a little
[40:56] I was little to be with and they just
[40:58] picked me up and knocked me down and I'd
[41:01] get up again and they knocked me down
[41:03] again till I got till I just got too
[41:06] able and unable to get up anymore that's
[41:08] all that's always and then when I got up
[41:10] able to get up I got up again they
[41:12] knocked me down again so that's just the
[41:15] way I had it I thought I can never be a
[41:18] Christian but when the Holy Spirit came
[41:19] into my life that that's what done it he
[41:22] said I had a woman one time I went to
[41:25] have to cut the lights off and that day
[41:28] I had a a hair on top of my head and she
[41:30] said you kinky you little kinky headed
[41:33] idiotic I told her I said woman you
[41:36] ought not to curse like that uh don't
[41:39] you fear
[41:41] God she said you little kinky eded
[41:44] idiotic if I wanted somebody to talk to
[41:46] me about things like that I would
[41:48] wouldn't get a half fo like you he said
[41:51] what he said uh then she called me a
[41:54] blankety blank name and uh if that had
[41:57] been a year farther I always said a man
[42:00] that strike a woman Wasn't Man Enough to
[42:02] strike a man but I might have broke that
[42:05] at that time of calling my mother a bad
[42:07] name like that he said but you know what
[42:10] he said it never even fased me I said I
[42:12] will pray for you never bothered I know
[42:15] right then something had happened to me
[42:17] yes sir oh my you know the evils that I
[42:20] done when I was a kid fighting almost
[42:22] killed five men at one time took a rifle
[42:24] loaded with 16 shots when then boys beat
[42:28] me up because I was a Kentucky and no
[42:29] other reason I couldn't even hold my
[42:31] head up one would hold me by hands like
[42:34] this and the other one would stand there
[42:36] with a rock in his hand and pound me in
[42:38] the face till I just lifeless nothing in
[42:41] the world they called me a Kentucky
[42:43] squab because my mother when she was
[42:45] young she sure looked like an Indian
[42:47] look looking at her picture a while ago
[42:49] and they know she was a half Indian
[42:51] because I was was from Kentucky and
[42:53] being a squab they called me a squab a
[42:56] Kentucky squab and I had nothing in the
[42:57] world to do into it couldn't help
[42:59] because I was born in Kentucky I went
[43:02] down there to school and I didn't have
[43:04] no clothes to wear and my hair hanging
[43:06] down on my neck Papa mom took pop sold
[43:09] coat if kids think they might have it
[43:11] bad today this this is uh at a different
[43:15] level than what a lot of these kids have
[43:17] today but Mom Pop and mom took Pop's old
[43:20] coat and he was that he was married in
[43:22] and cut it up and made me a pair of
[43:24] pants to wear to school my first time
[43:26] and she dressed me with a pair of white
[43:28] stockings on and a pair of tennis shoes
[43:31] and they said if you don't look like a
[43:32] windy kuckian and all of that and then
[43:36] they went that went all the all my all
[43:39] my school days he said and all and a
[43:41] couple of boys because I walked down the
[43:42] road with some little girl and packed
[43:43] her books they didn't want me to do that
[43:45] they met me down there and beat me till
[43:47] I was simply unconscious I told them if
[43:50] they just let me go I promised I would
[43:51] go right straight home and so they took
[43:54] let me loose kicked me four or five
[43:57] times knocked him down scraped my face
[43:59] all over and I went home like this up
[44:01] through the broom Sage field had a
[44:03] little 22 Winchester rifle laying up
[44:05] over the door reached up and got that
[44:07] rifle full of bullets went right down
[44:10] through the Locust Thicket hid by the
[44:12] side of the road till these five or six
[44:13] boys came along and just waited till
[44:16] they come when they was coming there
[44:18] talking said that Kentuckian will
[44:21] realize where he's at from this on going
[44:24] on like that he said I stepped up with
[44:26] the hammer pulled back on the rifle I
[44:28] said now which one of you wants to die
[44:30] first so you don't so you don't watch
[44:32] the others they started squealing I said
[44:34] don't squeal because you're all going to
[44:36] die one by one and I Meed and just then
[44:39] they started squealing and I pulled up
[44:42] up and snaap the gun snapped I throw
[44:45] another shell in snaap it snapped
[44:47] another shell snap it snapped and a pump
[44:49] 16 shells on the ground every one of
[44:51] them snapped and then boys
[44:54] running and screaming and driving over
[44:56] the hill and and everything and after
[44:58] they left I stood there when I'd got so
[45:01] angry till I wouldn't cry just would
[45:03] laugh like a idiot and tears run down in
[45:05] my eyes now that's a temper if it hadn't
[45:07] been for God i' had been a murderer and
[45:10] I picked up them shells and put them
[45:12] back in the rifle and pow pow they'd
[45:14] shoot just as good as ever and brother
[45:16] brenon says talk about
[45:18] Grace and that is with it is so with all
[45:21] our lives it's just the grace of the
[45:23] Lord that keeps us the grace of the Lord
[45:26] that saved us and the of the Lord that
[45:27] surely's ke kept us and going to keep us
[45:31] and just like I said this morning it
[45:33] seemed like everything everything well
[45:36] you don't want to say everything that
[45:37] could go wrong but it seemed like lots
[45:39] of stuff was going wrong of course then
[45:41] you know uh it's just one of those
[45:43] things but thanks thanks be to the grace
[45:46] of the Lord and uh that's one thing that
[45:48] I always go back to you know if we had
[45:51] something to do with it I'd be worried
[45:53] about it but he said he started the work
[45:55] into it in it in us and he's more than
[45:57] able to finish the work and that's where
[45:59] I I rest myself on this morning brother
[46:25] Steve
[46:32] I think all of us can
[46:35] identify with uh what brother Troy was
[46:38] talking about if it wasn't for the grace
[46:40] of
[46:41] God my
[46:47] my and thankfully he's not a respector a
[46:51] person or age or anything he can deal
[46:55] with you anytime
[46:57] any place

[1:08:07] want to bring to your attention and um
[1:08:11] brother Bor and myself we' had a talk
[1:08:13] and got together and we we were kind of
[1:08:15] contemplating and mentioned the idea of
[1:08:18] a of a Teenage Sunday school um but I
[1:08:21] think brother B prayed about it and we
[1:08:23] were praying together and and the decis
[1:08:25] ision was made at this time we're just
[1:08:27] going to leave that teenage Sunday
[1:08:28] school kind of kind of to kind of the
[1:08:31] way it is for now um but we do want to
[1:08:34] offer the the uh um offer you the the
[1:08:39] ability or the chance to write questions
[1:08:41] and answers uh or questions I guess on
[1:08:45] things that you have and and brother Bor
[1:08:47] and myself will work together to try to
[1:08:50] take a service maybe on a Sunday
[1:08:52] afternoon he said and and we will answer
[1:08:54] any questions at the teenagers may have
[1:08:56] and if there's any adults that has a
[1:08:58] question related to the word or the
[1:09:00] message or or things that you've heard
[1:09:02] are just curious of we'd be glad to look
[1:09:04] at them and examine them and so uh you
[1:09:06] know teenagers especially go through
[1:09:08] times in their life they have questions
[1:09:11] and uh and and we definitely want those
[1:09:13] questions answered in a scriptural
[1:09:14] biblical way uh to lead and guide in in
[1:09:18] the direction that that they need to be
[1:09:19] going so I just want to put that out
[1:09:21] there if you want to jot down a question
[1:09:23] if you have a question you could give it
[1:09:24] to myself for Brother Steve uh a brother
[1:09:27] Bower when he's back so uh just let that
[1:09:30] be uh kind of out there an option for
[1:09:32] you also I want you to uh to I ask that
[1:09:36] you remember brother Ted Pedley and
[1:09:38] brother uh Zachary Wallace as they be
[1:09:40] leaving I think it's today for India and
[1:09:43] uh brother Ted uh had had messaged me
[1:09:46] last night and I'd known he was going to
[1:09:47] be leaving and we've been in prayer for
[1:09:49] him and but he just wants to bring it
[1:09:51] before the church and he he just loves
[1:09:53] loves the church here and the people and
[1:09:54] he knows your sincerity and your
[1:09:56] dedication and and he ask that you would
[1:09:58] pray for them they they've had a good
[1:09:59] work in the past over the past several
[1:10:02] years that they go to India and and so
[1:10:05] just ask the Lord to to bless them watch
[1:10:07] over them give them safe travels and uh
[1:10:10] just use them use them while they're
[1:10:12] there so we certainly don't want to
[1:10:13] spend effort and time and money and
[1:10:15] travel and and then not not be a a a
[1:10:19] benefit or or God use us so he wants to
[1:10:22] be used and brother Zachary wants to be
[1:10:24] used and so just just ask that you
[1:10:25] remember that and also continue to
[1:10:27] remember brother berer today I know
[1:10:28] brother Steve mentioned that but um be
[1:10:30] with him he wants he just he really has
[1:10:32] a burden for that area and he's
[1:10:34] expressed that with me and a couple
[1:10:36] times and so we just want to uh hold him
[1:10:39] up today that he could say what what
[1:10:41] they need to hear and that they would uh
[1:10:44] you know be encouraged and and grow in
[1:10:46] the word in that area so um just kind of

[1:14:38] you're part of that number you're part
[1:14:40] of the one he's talking about that will
[1:14:41] live without a spot without a wrinkle
[1:14:43] without a blemish you say well I'm not
[1:14:46] there none of us are
[1:14:48] yet but we're trying to get there that's
[1:14:51] why we come and gather this morning to
[1:14:53] hear the word of God and say what is it
[1:14:56] God that I need to get me to a New
[1:14:59] Height if I need
[1:15:04] punishment it's hard to say punish
[1:15:11] me turn with me Psalms 23 familiar
[1:15:14] scripture I'm getting way ahead of
[1:15:16] myself but that's okay the Lord is my
[1:15:19] shepherd I shall not

[1:15:27] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[1:15:31] Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me
[1:15:35] in the paths of righteousness for his
[1:15:37] name's sake now watch here here's what I
[1:15:41] was going to get to this is not the one
[1:15:42] we was wanting to get to but we got to
[1:15:44] it yay though I walk through the valley
[1:15:47] of the shadow of
[1:15:50] death
[1:15:51] corruption what do you think about when
[1:15:53] you think about death you think about
[1:15:55] corruption corruption is set in you
[1:15:57] think about death you think about
[1:15:58] corruption so here is this Valley of the
[1:16:01] shadow of death and here we are in
[1:16:03] corrupt bodies living in a corrupt world
[1:16:06] but thank God there's going to come a
[1:16:08] time when this corrupt body will put on
[1:16:11] incorruption when this Mortal body of
[1:16:13] mortality will put on
[1:16:16] immortality so that's where the next
[1:16:18] verse comes in so I will fear no
[1:16:22] evil for thou are with me thy Ro and my
[1:16:25] staff they comfort me aren't you
[1:16:26] thankful to have a Shepherd this morning

[1:16:33] that you go through that's the God we
[1:16:37] serve thou preparest a table before me

[1:16:47] oil and my cup runneth
[1:16:50] over you mean to tell me we can live in
[1:16:53] a place like that where we're we're so
[1:16:55] anointed by the Holy Ghost and the oil
[1:16:58] of the holy spirit that our cup can run
[1:17:00] over in this corrupt and wicked nasty

[1:17:24] don't have to live defeated lives surely
[1:17:27] goodness and
[1:17:29] mercy were sheltered brothers and
[1:17:31] sisters in the Tabernacle of God's
[1:17:33] presence surely goodness and mercy will
[1:17:36] follow me all the days of my life and I
[1:17:38] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:17:42] forever secure in his
[1:17:45] Tabernacle one more quick scripture you
[1:17:47] don't have to turn there but Isaiah 40
[1:17:49] but they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:17:51] renew their strength they shall Mount up
[1:17:54] with wings as eagles they shall run and
[1:17:57] not be weary they shall walk and not
[1:18:01] faint you can have your
[1:18:06] seats now looking at this little thought
[1:18:08] here this morning it definitely went in
[1:18:09] a different direction from what I had
[1:18:11] had originally had thought we were going
[1:18:13] to go but I like the L leadership of the
[1:18:16] Lord and I trust it'll be a blessing to
[1:18:17] all of us so we either need it or God
[1:18:20] wouldn't have give it okay so we look
[1:18:22] here and the prophet says now I want you
[1:18:24] to watch the New Testament Christian how
[1:18:26] many's the New Testament Christian this
[1:18:28] morning I want you to watch the New
[1:18:30] Testament Christian he said see Paul he
[1:18:32] had Visions he started out one way got
[1:18:36] between Straits a vision coming over to
[1:18:38] Macedonia out on the sea 14 days and
[1:18:42] nights now watch the place he was in
[1:18:44] there was no moon no
[1:18:47] stars you know when you're out on the
[1:18:49] Seas you kind of need the moon and the
[1:18:51] stars in those days that's how they
[1:18:53] navigated
[1:18:55] and he said there was there was Paul out
[1:18:57] there on the sea 14 days with no moon no
[1:19:01] stars all hopes of ever being saved was
[1:19:05] gone what a place to be
[1:19:08] in think about it now he said but then
[1:19:11] all of a sudden the angel of the Lord
[1:19:12] come to him and said Don't Fear Paul you
[1:19:15] must go before Caesar and he said how
[1:19:18] Paul little Paul and that ship Still
[1:19:20] rocking and waterlog can you imagine the
[1:19:22] waves coming in the ter tulous waves
[1:19:26] coming in and overtaking maybe the boat
[1:19:27] the little ship and there's Paul rocking
[1:19:30] back and forth no stars no moon no hope
[1:19:33] all lost and then the angel comes to him
[1:19:36] and the angel Paul said he stood by him
[1:19:38] day and
[1:19:42] night he said it was just to show me he
[1:19:45] said that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:19:47] yesterday today and
[1:19:50] forever Jesus Christ wasn't going to let
[1:19:53] Paul falter out there in the sea he knew
[1:19:55] exactly where Paul would be God knows
[1:19:57] when we find ourselves in our
[1:20:00] valleys God knows when you're going
[1:20:02] through despair God knows when you're
[1:20:04] going through discouragement and
[1:20:06] depression God knows that he knows when
[1:20:08] you can't see the sun the Stars the moon
[1:20:11] and there's no way around no way out and
[1:20:14] he says watch the New Testament
[1:20:16] Christian Paul he said Paul looking at
[1:20:19] someone and preaching and said I
[1:20:21] perceive that you have faith to be
[1:20:23] healed
[1:20:25] that's the New Testament Christian
[1:20:27] that's who we're talking about today you
[1:20:28] and I the New Testament
[1:20:31] Christian he said look at the New
[1:20:33] Testament Christian Peter Peter being in
[1:20:35] the spirit of the Holy Ghost come upon
[1:20:37] him he rebuked their sins and told him
[1:20:39] what they' done talking about an anas
[1:20:41] and Safar he said you see this
[1:20:44] practically the same thing happening
[1:20:46] Night by Night the Holy Spirit revealing
[1:20:49] and
[1:20:50] showing a new testament Christian
[1:20:52] brothers and sisters these men Paul
[1:20:54] Peter all these ones that was the the
[1:20:56] founders of our faith before us they
[1:20:59] found themselves in un predicaments un
[1:21:01] un un unimaginable
[1:21:04] predicaments but yet God was still there
[1:21:07] in their
[1:21:08] Valley God said Peter Paul even though
[1:21:11] you're in a valley in your life I will
[1:21:13] raise you to new heights and that's what
[1:21:16] I'm talking about that's my message this
[1:21:18] morning New Heights that's all I'm I'm
[1:21:20] naming it new heights and he's calling
[1:21:23] us up to a new heights the prophet said
[1:21:25] aren't you happy we should be the
[1:21:27] happiest people in the world that we're
[1:21:29] Christians living in this day
[1:21:32] friend this
[1:21:35] day the day that we said was the most
[1:21:37] wicked the most nastiest the most
[1:21:39] gnarliest the most out to get you day we
[1:21:43] should be the happiest people on the
[1:21:45] face of the Earth and he says right
[1:21:47] there he says we're the happiest people
[1:21:49] in the world he said don't look for
[1:21:51] anything greater because you can't have
[1:21:54] no greater than the Holy
[1:21:57] Spirit he said you got that right now
[1:22:00] just love it and embrace it and let it
[1:22:03] move for you and help
[1:22:06] you oh brothers and sisters I'm afraid
[1:22:09] that's where a lot of us get in
[1:22:11] trouble we get in trouble and he says
[1:22:15] each one of you listen to this he says
[1:22:18] you got it right now love it and embrace
[1:22:20] it each one of you what little faith
[1:22:21] that you've got tonight how many's got a
[1:22:23] little faith you said I don't have a lot
[1:22:25] but how many's got a
[1:22:27] little all right he says if you've got a
[1:22:30] little faith just turn it
[1:22:35] loose turn it loose he says turn it
[1:22:39] loose and let God have his way with you
[1:22:41] and God will grant it so many times we
[1:22:45] want to hold on to ourselves we want to
[1:22:47] embrace ourselves we want to love
[1:22:49] ourselves and we're not willing to turn
[1:22:51] loose of us we're not willing to turn
[1:22:53] loose this morning of the Securities of
[1:22:56] in our own life because as humans we
[1:22:59] want that that shelter we want that
[1:23:03] security and we think we're in control
[1:23:06] but that's not what God says that's not
[1:23:08] what the prophet says through the spoken
[1:23:10] word of God no he said if you've got a
[1:23:12] little faith turn it loose and let God
[1:23:15] have his way what does he mean by that
[1:23:19] he says now if you have the testified
[1:23:21] the truth of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:23:22] Christ and he says he will testify me
[1:23:25] that I have told you the truth if he
[1:23:27] testifies that I have told you the truth
[1:23:29] then every one of you ought to believe
[1:23:30] on
[1:23:32] him he says now remember here's my
[1:23:37] words to
[1:23:39] You allall ears ought to be perked up
[1:23:42] right now cuz when the prophet says
[1:23:44] here's my words to you you might want to
[1:23:47] listen he says here's my words to
[1:23:53] You and every
[1:23:55] sinner every person every sinner that is
[1:23:58] here is already
[1:24:02] saved here's my words for you that every
[1:24:06] sinner has already been saved some 19900
[1:24:09] years ago but it'll never do you no good
[1:24:12] unless you accept
[1:24:15] it all of these promises that lie in the
[1:24:18] book all of these promises that lie in
[1:24:20] the message brothers and sisters we have
[1:24:23] to accept it
[1:24:25] you can't just read it you can't just
[1:24:27] vocalize it you have to take possession
[1:24:29] of it and grab it and accept what God
[1:24:33] does for
[1:24:35] us every sick person every Afflicted
[1:24:38] person the blood of Jesus Christ is in
[1:24:41] Calvary right now and you were healed
[1:24:45] 1900 years
[1:24:47] ago but it'll do you no good if you
[1:24:49] don't accept
[1:24:51] it you just accept it and believe it and
[1:24:54] you will get
[1:24:59] well so today we're going to look at a
[1:25:02] few different
[1:25:05] thoughts going to spend quite a bit of
[1:25:07] time
[1:25:08] on who we are and a type of God's called
[1:25:12] us but I want you to know that over in
[1:25:15] Israel studying this out I found that
[1:25:17] over in Israel there's a road from
[1:25:19] Jerusalem to
[1:25:20] Jericho and there's a canyon called the
[1:25:23] valley of the shadow of
[1:25:25] death maybe some of you has been there
[1:25:28] and been been fortunate to travel maybe
[1:25:30] you've seen it or or read about it but
[1:25:32] no doubt King David probably traveled
[1:25:34] through this Valley many times in his
[1:25:37] life and some of these Canyons that run
[1:25:39] along the Jericho Road they were very
[1:25:41] narrow at the bottom and but on the
[1:25:43] walls on the sides of these canyons in
[1:25:45] this Valley it would be 800t tall now
[1:25:49] keep in mind there that the only time
[1:25:51] that you could see Sunshine at the
[1:25:53] bottom was at noon time when the sun is
[1:25:56] straight
[1:25:58] overhead can you imagine walking through
[1:26:00] this Canyon 800 foot walls on the side
[1:26:04] of you no sunlight but for just a few
[1:26:07] minutes of the day straight overhead is
[1:26:09] when the sun can hit
[1:26:13] you we feel like sometimes we get in a
[1:26:15] valley in a place in our
[1:26:18] lives that do the sun Even
[1:26:21] Shine I'm just being honest we've had a
[1:26:24] lot of
[1:26:25] uplift and feel-good messages but let me
[1:26:28] tell you life ain't always uplifting and
[1:26:30] good right sometimes Life's a struggle
[1:26:34] and sometimes we go through these
[1:26:35] valleys and and valleys often time we
[1:26:37] look and we know that valleys in the
[1:26:39] Bible it's a metaphor for difficult
[1:26:41] times times of Darkness times of Despair
[1:26:44] times of defeat times of
[1:26:48] discouragement how many's ever had
[1:26:50] those we all have and the Bible teaches
[1:26:54] us that God is Not Just God on the
[1:26:56] mountain
[1:26:58] toop but he's God in the valley as well
[1:27:03] and in these valleys is where we do some
[1:27:04] of our greatest
[1:27:06] growing now we may not like it but in
[1:27:08] The Valleys is where the most fertile
[1:27:11] ground is you know I had somebody come
[1:27:14] do a soil test on my property few years
[1:27:16] back because we seem like we couldn't
[1:27:18] grow grass in the pasture and it was
[1:27:19] just a just a rock hole and and so we
[1:27:22] couldn't grow but there had this one
[1:27:24] little Hillside over here and it kind of
[1:27:26] swept down into a bottom and they done
[1:27:28] the soil T test and they come back and
[1:27:30] they said yeah your soil's no good out
[1:27:31] here in this flat it's very poor very
[1:27:34] very poor it don't have a lot of
[1:27:36] nutrients it's don't have a lot of
[1:27:38] topsole but over here where the grass is
[1:27:41] growing what you've got is a lot of top
[1:27:43] soil what you got over there is a lot of
[1:27:46] nutrients and the reason you've got
[1:27:48] those I said well what's different I can
[1:27:49] see it all from the backyard what's
[1:27:51] different about it he said well what's
[1:27:53] different is it comes down out of that
[1:27:55] Hillside there and all that top soil
[1:27:57] runs off down into that
[1:28:03] Valley we need the
[1:28:06] valleys you say I don't want no valleys
[1:28:09] we need the valleys because in The
[1:28:12] Valleys is when you find
[1:28:14] out when you is when you call out to God
[1:28:17] with a different kind of
[1:28:19] urgency you talk to God different when
[1:28:21] you're in the valley you talk talk to
[1:28:24] God different in a different kind of
[1:28:26] urgency and it's when we see who we are
[1:28:29] it's when we see see what we're made of
[1:28:31] or might we say where the rubber meets
[1:28:33] the
[1:28:34] road is when we cry out to God in The
[1:28:38] Valleys many of us experienced those
[1:28:40] valleys and if you haven't experienced
[1:28:42] those valleys you will experience those
[1:28:45] valleys maybe someone here today is
[1:28:47] experiencing a
[1:28:49] valley let me tell you if you're
[1:28:52] wondering how will I ever see daylight
[1:28:54] in this
[1:28:56] Valley just look straight
[1:28:59] overhead just like on that road down
[1:29:01] there to Jerusalem to Jericho if you
[1:29:04] look straight up overhead you'll see the
[1:29:06] sun brothers and sisters we need the
[1:29:08] sunlight the s o n to come shine down on
[1:29:11] our lives and he's with us in these
[1:29:16] valleys valleys are part of this life
[1:29:19] valleys are
[1:29:20] inevitable valleys they they you find
[1:29:24] yourself in those valleys because that's
[1:29:25] life and and and you can't avoid these
[1:29:28] valleys and instead you can count on
[1:29:31] them they're going to be there they're
[1:29:34] going to they're going to come at you
[1:29:36] they'll be there you don't have to go
[1:29:38] looking for them you'll walk right into
[1:29:42] them valleys happen to everybody they're
[1:29:44] not they're they're impartial you ever
[1:29:47] notice good things happen to bad people
[1:29:49] and bad things happen to good
[1:29:51] people yeah it's part of life it's what
[1:29:53] we go through through because we're in a
[1:29:55] fallen and broken world so we have
[1:29:57] problems and nobody is immune to those
[1:30:02] problems but how do we handle it as
[1:30:04] Christian we're not insulated from Pain
[1:30:07] how many's ever went through pain you
[1:30:09] hurt you cry you you you you have
[1:30:11] anguish inside of you and you cry out
[1:30:14] and you're
[1:30:17] hurting you're not insulated to that
[1:30:20] nobody sails through this life Problem
[1:30:22] free no the ible tells us that many are
[1:30:25] the afflictions of the
[1:30:26] righteous but the Lord
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:54] these valleys are
[1:30:56] unpredictable we're going to get to a
[1:30:57] thought here in a minute are you with me
[1:31:00] these valleys are unpredictable you
[1:31:02] can't plan them you can't time them
[1:31:05] because you know if problems usually
[1:31:08] catch you off guard have you ever
[1:31:10] noticed
[1:31:11] that the valleys of the problems that
[1:31:14] you go through is usually at the worst
[1:31:15] time that could happen
[1:31:17] right yeah yeah you let things be going
[1:31:20] good and you're selling through life man
[1:31:22] you everything is just fine paychecks
[1:31:24] are rolling in kids are doing good a
[1:31:27] straight A in school job you guys just
[1:31:29] got a
[1:31:31] raise yeah but you wait wait there and
[1:31:34] just wait and see when the bank
[1:31:37] account's full everything's good that's
[1:31:40] right but the freezer don't go out when
[1:31:43] the bank account's full you don't have a
[1:31:46] flat tile when the bank account's
[1:31:49] full your kids are not running around
[1:31:52] acting acting foolish
[1:31:54] come on
[1:31:56] church I'm speaking reality to you this
[1:31:58] morning I'm speaking reality that this
[1:32:00] is what we have to go
[1:32:03] through but thank God thank god brother
[1:32:07] Joe that God has likened his people to
[1:32:10] something
[1:32:12] better God has likened Us in the in the
[1:32:15] Bible as many things he likened us as a
[1:32:17] branch on a vine as a tree by a river as
[1:32:20] a light on a hill he's liken us as sheep
[1:32:22] as salt as racers in a race he he Likens
[1:32:26] us as wrestlers he Likens us as Warriors
[1:32:30] have you ever thought about it but the
[1:32:32] the greatest thing I think is when he
[1:32:34] Likens us to an
[1:32:37] eagle I tell you what I love
[1:32:40] Eagles I love them I love them I love
[1:32:43] their beauty I love their nature I love
[1:32:45] their character to me they're the most
[1:32:48] wonderful animal in God's
[1:32:51] creation second probably being the line
[1:32:54] but I love these Eagles and I'm so glad
[1:32:58] that God chose to liken his people to an
[1:33:02] eagle he identifies us as
[1:33:06] Eagles he identifies
[1:33:09] us as something that Soares above the
[1:33:13] challenges you see he could have likened
[1:33:15] us to any kind of bird he wanted to he
[1:33:17] could have likened us to to a lot of
[1:33:19] them if he had so desired he had a right
[1:33:21] to because no doubt we display many of
[1:33:24] the
[1:33:25] characters
[1:33:28] attitudes
[1:33:30] jealousies
[1:33:32] indifferences angers
[1:33:35] hatreds he could have likened us to
[1:33:40] chickens those that's got chickens just
[1:33:43] chuckled those that's been around
[1:33:45] chickens know what I'm talking about he
[1:33:47] could have likened us to chickens
[1:33:49] chickens are crowd followers you ever
[1:33:52] seen chickens you get a bunch ofi chiens
[1:33:54] and and you get one that's running
[1:33:55] across the yard and what's the rest of
[1:33:57] them do they take off after them and
[1:33:58] they just they just waddle and they're
[1:33:59] chasing that leader chicken for what
[1:34:01] reason they have no
[1:34:03] idea but when one goes they all
[1:34:06] go yeah they're displaying thems in that
[1:34:10] way they don't want to miss out nothing
[1:34:12] that the majority's doing uh
[1:34:14] oh they don't want to miss out on
[1:34:16] nothing that the majori doing what are
[1:34:18] they doing they're chasing the
[1:34:20] majority and we got to be careful as
[1:34:22] Christians that we don't fall lack in
[1:34:24] our spiritualness and lack in our
[1:34:27] teachings lack in our
[1:34:29] word and go following after the
[1:34:32] majority because the majority will lead
[1:34:35] you to a
[1:34:38] Slaughter can you
[1:34:40] imagine if he would have likened us to
[1:34:45] chickens chickens naturally they
[1:34:49] squabble and they
[1:34:52] fight
[1:34:55] yeah over things in a chicken yard they
[1:34:58] squabble and they fight you let one of
[1:35:00] them you throw one of them a little
[1:35:03] treat he pick it up we we feed ours
[1:35:06] eggshells to make the shells harder for
[1:35:08] the next batch and so we throw them
[1:35:11] eggshells in our man that one he'll pick
[1:35:12] up that shell and he takes off running
[1:35:14] and the rest of them just tackle
[1:35:17] him he don't get a chance to get a
[1:35:19] single bik cuz he's hunkered over in the
[1:35:21] corner and he's getting whipped
[1:35:26] fighting squabbling chasing each other
[1:35:29] all around the yard over a bug or a
[1:35:35] grasshopper be careful
[1:35:38] Christians be careful brother Brown said
[1:35:41] a lot of that comes from from
[1:35:43] jealousy yeah he says the Joneses they
[1:35:46] paint their steps red you want to know
[1:35:48] how I was going to apply this to the
[1:35:49] message didn't you he said the Joneses
[1:35:51] they paint their steps red and you got
[1:35:53] to have yours red
[1:35:56] also H he says this is a horrible spirit
[1:36:01] for a Christian to
[1:36:08] have chickens they have no interest in
[1:36:12] the
[1:36:14] heavenlies no you watch a bunch of
[1:36:17] chickens and they're just content to
[1:36:18] live out in that old nasty stinking
[1:36:21] filthy chicken yard right they love it
[1:36:25] they can just pack and scratch and and
[1:36:27] pick up what they want and eat on it eat
[1:36:29] on it two or three times and they get
[1:36:32] form in
[1:36:34] habits they form filthy habits as they
[1:36:37] pick and they scratch and they they stay
[1:36:38] out in the chicken yard are you with me
[1:36:40] come on church and they stay out there
[1:36:43] in this yard and and they never have
[1:36:45] their eyes on the sky but their eyes are
[1:36:47] always on the
[1:36:49] ground yep looking down at the ground
[1:36:51] trying to figure out where they're going
[1:36:52] to go where going to do scratching here
[1:36:54] picking
[1:36:59] there most of them will never fly do you
[1:37:02] know
[1:37:03] that they got the ability
[1:37:06] to they've got the they've got what God
[1:37:08] give them to fly it's called
[1:37:13] Wings and most of them could take flight
[1:37:16] if they wanted to but they just live in
[1:37:18] that chicken yard right behind a fence
[1:37:21] about this
[1:37:22] tall
[1:37:25] you know I put a net over my chicken pan
[1:37:27] not because I was afraid they'd fly out
[1:37:29] I was afraid what would fly in and get
[1:37:31] them they're not going anywhere they're
[1:37:35] content brother and sisters we're not
[1:37:37] Earthbound creatures this morning we
[1:37:40] have been called to raise our sights to
[1:37:42] look to new heights to new Heavens where
[1:37:45] heavenbound creatures this morning
[1:37:47] that's why God couldn't liken us to
[1:37:50] [Applause]
[1:37:52] chickens that chicken life could never
[1:37:55] could never compare to the life of an
[1:37:57] eagle the chicken can't live like an
[1:38:00] eagle that chicken can't feed like an
[1:38:03] eagle that chicken can experience what
[1:38:05] Eagles
[1:38:09] experience but living the eagle life
[1:38:12] that's another
[1:38:14] story we hear the word Eagle we see in
[1:38:18] our minds what do you see you see a bird
[1:38:21] flying high above everything and
[1:38:23] Majestic bird flying and soaring to
[1:38:25] places that no other bird can
[1:38:29] fly and you see that right there and you
[1:38:31] begin to get that in your atmosphere and
[1:38:34] you realize that that eagle is the king
[1:38:36] of the sky that's right amen he's the
[1:38:39] king of the sky he's the master of his
[1:38:45] domain and he has a keenness of an
[1:38:48] eye and he spies out his
[1:38:50] prey and he swoops down to get his pray
[1:38:54] and he comes down with tremendous speed
[1:38:55] and sharp talons and he snatches it up
[1:38:59] and he takes his meal and he Soares back
[1:39:01] up to his nest he don't sit down there
[1:39:05] and feed and eat and filth and manure
[1:39:09] right too many Christians find
[1:39:11] themselves feeding in filth and
[1:39:16] manure you say well I got a good church
[1:39:18] to go to I'm not talking about where
[1:39:20] you're feeding here I'm talking about
[1:39:22] when you feeding outside of the house
[1:39:25] I'm talking about when you're feeding
[1:39:26] out in the world when you're when you're
[1:39:28] dabbling in things that I'm just leave
[1:39:30] it alone I believe I I believe you know
[1:39:33] where we're going with
[1:39:35] that but he doesn't feed in that field
[1:39:38] he Soares above
[1:39:42] it I was going to work one day and God's
[1:39:46] been good to me he knows I love Eagles
[1:39:48] and and I see them and probably there's
[1:39:51] a lot of you here maybe never seen one I
[1:39:52] hope you have but there's a lot of
[1:39:54] people that never ever see one living in
[1:39:57] this area I see them all the time and
[1:39:59] it's usually when I'm in in in prayer or
[1:40:02] burden or asking or need a confirmation
[1:40:04] I see an eagle I say thank you
[1:40:07] Lord I tell you a little secret I got
[1:40:09] one living right down the road here we
[1:40:12] seen him the other day didn't we and I
[1:40:14] told Jo I said that's my
[1:40:16] Eagle I see him all the time I see him
[1:40:19] over here I see him over there he just
[1:40:21] lives about a mile from our house that's
[1:40:22] my thank God for my
[1:40:26] Eagle but I was going to Hopkinsville
[1:40:29] one day and I know where that eagle
[1:40:30] lives over there and if you if you've
[1:40:33] ever been to Hopkinsville and get ready
[1:40:34] to get on the bypass or the the parkway
[1:40:36] go to Madisonville you'll notice that
[1:40:39] there's hundreds and hundreds and
[1:40:40] hundreds of
[1:40:41] buzzards they're there all the time and
[1:40:45] these buzzards just fill the sky and
[1:40:47] they're circling and they're circling
[1:40:49] and they're just going around and around
[1:40:50] and around and I happen to have the
[1:40:52] thought of eag on my mind that day and I
[1:40:54] was trying to think about it so I kind
[1:40:56] of had my eyes sharpened up looking and
[1:40:58] I thought nothing but a bunch of
[1:41:01] stinking
[1:41:02] buzzards and then I looked I thought no
[1:41:05] way and up higher than the
[1:41:09] buzzards I said up higher than the
[1:41:12] buzzards I seen a sharp flash of white
[1:41:16] and I said it can't be and I looked and
[1:41:18] saw in hundreds of feet above those
[1:41:20] buzzards was an eagle with his wings out
[1:41:22] and I said thank you God as Eagles we
[1:41:25] fly far above the
[1:41:28] buzzards the ground don't hold us
[1:41:34] down and there's something special about
[1:41:37] eagles for years for centuries hundreds
[1:41:40] of years Nations recognize Eagles
[1:41:43] kingdoms recognize Eagles Empires
[1:41:46] recognize eagles they put them on coins
[1:41:49] they put them on their seals they put
[1:41:50] them on their
[1:41:52] Flags what's the
[1:41:54] USA the
[1:41:56] eagle and and just like that God in his
[1:41:59] word tells us that we're identified with
[1:42:01] that bird of the air that eagle and that
[1:42:04] we're identified right there he's
[1:42:05] calling us spiritual
[1:42:10] Eagles you know a newborn eaglet is kind
[1:42:12] of like describing a newborn
[1:42:17] Christian yep that little Eagle he he
[1:42:21] he's just he's born
[1:42:24] peeps his way out of that egg and his
[1:42:27] eyes and his mouth is wide
[1:42:29] open it's the first thing he
[1:42:33] does what's that newborn
[1:42:35] doing he saying feed
[1:42:38] me feed
[1:42:39] me feed me and he's sitting there his
[1:42:43] parents they're they're just kept so
[1:42:45] busy because this little bird just keeps
[1:42:47] his mouth throw back feed me feed me
[1:42:49] feed me and so they go and hunt and they
[1:42:51] come down and they feed him
[1:42:53] and they feed him and what is it with
[1:42:56] the newborn Christian or Christians in
[1:42:57] general we constantly have our mouth
[1:42:59] throw open saying God feed me feed
[1:43:04] me why because that eaglet has an
[1:43:07] unsatisfiable desire for
[1:43:10] food I have an unsatisfiable desire for
[1:43:13] more of God in my
[1:43:17] life and God is like those Eagle parents
[1:43:21] and he tells these eaglets I am the Lord
[1:43:23] thy God with which brought you out of
[1:43:25] the land of Egypt open your mouth and
[1:43:28] I'll f it that's a scripture if you
[1:43:31] don't know it he told him I'm the one
[1:43:34] who brought you out of Egypt if you'll
[1:43:36] open your mouth I will feel it so that
[1:43:39] Mama and that Daddy Eagle they know what
[1:43:41] that baby eagle needs to eat they know
[1:43:45] what it has to have and Jehovah God
[1:43:48] Eagle knows exactly what you and I have
[1:43:51] need of this morning he knows exactly
[1:43:54] what your needs
[1:43:57] are I'm not talking about a new car I'm
[1:43:59] not talking about a financial need I'm
[1:44:01] talking about just when you're downcast
[1:44:03] when your spirit's broken he knows you
[1:44:06] need Joy he knows you need happiness and
[1:44:08] he will sense something by your way if
[1:44:11] we just look to the
[1:44:15] sun that's why we have to feed on the
[1:44:18] word that's why we have to feed on the
[1:44:20] word on a daily basis eat and eat and
[1:44:22] eat and eat on the word eat on the
[1:44:25] spiritual nutrients that's down on the
[1:44:27] inside and allow us to
[1:44:29] grow because it's only in the word of
[1:44:32] God that we find ourselves growing
[1:44:34] you're not going to grow watching
[1:44:36] YouTube that's right you're not going to
[1:44:39] grow watching Tik Tock you're not going
[1:44:42] to grow going to ball games nothing
[1:44:44] against it nothing against any of those
[1:44:47] things in moderation and and if you
[1:44:48] control
[1:44:50] it but if I ask you honestly if you're
[1:44:52] doing those things are you
[1:44:54] growing
[1:44:58] no no and feed on
[1:45:02] that but yet they're just withering up
[1:45:05] they're withering up because they never
[1:45:09] eat on the word of God it's
[1:45:12] dependent on the life on that food from
[1:45:15] his
[1:45:17] mouth you know the word Eagle means
[1:45:20] listen to this it means one feeding with
[1:45:23] the
[1:45:24] beak one feeding with the beak so God is
[1:45:27] feeding his own with the words out of
[1:45:30] his own
[1:45:31] mouth as you throw your head back and
[1:45:34] say God I need food he says here my
[1:45:36] child here my child here my child and
[1:45:39] he's constantly feeding and nurturing
[1:45:41] and getting us to where he wants us to
[1:45:43] be because you know Eagles can only
[1:45:46] thrive on Eagle food that's right and
[1:45:50] nothing else can take the place of that
[1:45:52] eagle food
[1:45:53] that eagle food helps Eagles to grow it
[1:45:57] helps Eagles to mature it helps them to
[1:45:59] become strong it helps them to push out
[1:46:01] new feathers to
[1:46:05] fly but if you don't take a the proper
[1:46:09] diet if you don't follow the proper diet
[1:46:12] that eagle you know what happens to them
[1:46:14] they begin to grow weak they begin to
[1:46:16] get sickly their feathers begin to fall
[1:46:19] out their eyesight begins to dim
[1:46:23] and they begin to get weaker and weaker
[1:46:25] and weaker until eventually they die and
[1:46:29] brothers and sisters we don't need
[1:46:31] spiritual
[1:46:32] death we need spiritual food we need
[1:46:35] food in due season food that strengthens
[1:46:37] us and draws us closer to
[1:46:41] God I witnessed this firsthand several
[1:46:44] years back 20 maybe 20 years I don't
[1:46:46] know we were working brother John and
[1:46:49] myself and we cut down a tree some of
[1:46:51] you I think I've told some simar this
[1:46:53] something of the story in some time or
[1:46:55] another we cut down a tree and it had
[1:46:57] three Eagles or three Hawks sorry three
[1:47:00] Hawks in it
[1:47:03] babies broke their nest all up and there
[1:47:06] they laid all bind up in the in the
[1:47:08] branches of the
[1:47:09] tree and knowing what I know now I
[1:47:12] probably should have left them cu the
[1:47:13] mama she was whistling above us and she
[1:47:16] no doubt would have come and probably
[1:47:17] tried to put a new Nest together or she
[1:47:19] would have done something with them but
[1:47:21] I thought hey they ain't going to
[1:47:22] survive
[1:47:23] we're taking them with
[1:47:25] us so I brought home one and another guy
[1:47:28] took home a couple and I brought that
[1:47:30] Hulk home I tell you what I had him in a
[1:47:33] cage and I I went down there and I got I
[1:47:35] started having to feed him by hand and I
[1:47:38] went I bought
[1:47:40] all all kinds of hamburger
[1:47:43] meat sure enough I go down there and and
[1:47:46] I'd pinch a little bit I had a glove on
[1:47:48] and I pinch a little bit of that in a
[1:47:49] ball and stick it in there where it look
[1:47:51] like a look like a mom mama coming down
[1:47:53] you know and he sit there he had a head
[1:47:56] throwback just like that every time he
[1:47:58] see me come he knew me he knew what was
[1:48:00] coming and I would taking out Peach and
[1:48:02] I put man he snatch it out my hand I'd
[1:48:05] be like do I still have my
[1:48:07] fingers see that's the way it is a
[1:48:09] Christian wants it they grab it and that
[1:48:12] little Hulk he would just snatch it out
[1:48:13] of my hands and he was doing real good
[1:48:15] for a while man he grew and and we could
[1:48:17] let him out in the yard he'd fly around
[1:48:19] the yard and he would just kind of stay
[1:48:22] around us knowing I was his mama you
[1:48:24] know I was mama
[1:48:26] Hulk and he would stay around and bounce
[1:48:28] around and and he got doing real good
[1:48:30] but then all of a sudden he started to
[1:48:32] look a little
[1:48:34] poorly he started looking a little
[1:48:36] poorly and a little weak he didn't sound
[1:48:39] quite right and I was feeding him
[1:48:40] feeding him he was eating man he was
[1:48:42] eating he was eating he was
[1:48:44] eating and I called the vet and I said
[1:48:46] you know what this may not be legal even
[1:48:48] what I'm doing I don't know but this
[1:48:51] bird is not doing good
[1:48:53] here's the situation he said he's
[1:48:55] lacking
[1:48:57] calcium he's lacking
[1:49:01] calcium you see I was feeding him all
[1:49:03] the meat I could feed
[1:49:05] him he was he was he was in the
[1:49:08] Bible he was
[1:49:10] reading he was eating he was taking it
[1:49:14] in but I didn't give him any bones to go
[1:49:16] with
[1:49:17] it he didn't have any calcium he wasn't
[1:49:20] getting enough of the
[1:49:21] message to go along with the
[1:49:24] word he was eating it up eating it up
[1:49:26] eating it up but he just kind of pushed
[1:49:28] the message out to the
[1:49:29] side I wasn't feeding him no message
[1:49:33] brothers and sisters we got to have both
[1:49:35] we got to have the word of God and the
[1:49:38] message of the hour and the two come
[1:49:40] together and it gives you a complete
[1:49:42] nutritious
[1:49:43] diet without that calcium that burn he
[1:49:46] was so defent I couldn't never get it
[1:49:48] back up and he ended up just kind of
[1:49:49] withering away and and he died and and
[1:49:52] and that's the way we are if we don't
[1:49:55] take in all of God's word and feast on E
[1:49:58] on Eagle
[1:49:59] food you're going to D wither away
[1:50:02] you're going to find yourself going
[1:50:09] away is this all right this
[1:50:15] morning sometimes we as eaglets we don't
[1:50:18] practice a serious eating of the word of
[1:50:21] God we become picky with our
[1:50:25] food
[1:50:26] uhoh it's going to hit a nerve isn't it
[1:50:30] we become picky with our
[1:50:33] food we begin to put together our own
[1:50:37] menu yeah yeah we we begin to put put
[1:50:40] our own menu together and and we begin
[1:50:42] to compile a comprise composition of our
[1:50:46] own favorite verses our own favorite
[1:50:50] quotes we put together these quotes that
[1:50:52] contain positive confessions and and
[1:50:54] positive affirmations and and we put
[1:50:57] together these these promises and these
[1:50:59] quotes that are that that we can do no
[1:51:01] wrong and and but what happens when we
[1:51:03] void out the verses that confronts us
[1:51:06] condemns us and chastens us and CH and
[1:51:09] challenges
[1:51:13] us we need Scripture to challenge our
[1:51:16] filthy
[1:51:18] Lifestyles we need the word of God in
[1:51:20] its fullness and in its entirety or El
[1:51:23] we never mature as Christians we will
[1:51:26] never mature so you know we we there's
[1:51:28] people that get this get these favorite
[1:51:30] quotes and and they got it in their mind
[1:51:32] that oh my goodness God is so good God
[1:51:35] Is My Savior God's my John
[1:51:38] 3:16 but that's where they
[1:51:42] stop God sent a
[1:51:46] prophet there's a bride in this
[1:51:49] hour oh that's all that's good that's
[1:51:52] wonderful well I believe it I love it
[1:51:53] with all my heart but if I don't take
[1:51:56] what that Prophet said in its
[1:52:00] entirety if I don't take entirely what
[1:52:03] it said what he said and it take
[1:52:04] entirely what the word says I'm never
[1:52:07] going to be a part of that
[1:52:13] bride and we find those people are
[1:52:16] diaper
[1:52:18] Christians thank you brother
[1:52:21] Steve
[1:52:25] they
[1:52:26] uh they they they're not weaned from the
[1:52:30] milk they're still feeding on milky
[1:52:33] word they're not been weaned yet
[1:52:35] sometime 40 years old 50 607 it don't
[1:52:38] matter what your age is if you're not
[1:52:40] feeding on the word in its entirety and
[1:52:43] you're just living by a handful of
[1:52:45] scriptures and sermons and
[1:52:47] quotes a diaper
[1:52:50] baby and don't give me oh I love
[1:52:53] babies they're beautiful you know Austin
[1:52:57] Serenity they just brought us a new baby
[1:52:59] into this world and man that thing is
[1:53:01] just as cute as a button that's
[1:53:05] right but you know that baby won't
[1:53:07] always be a
[1:53:09] baby that baby is not always going to
[1:53:11] drink
[1:53:12] milk that baby has to come to a point
[1:53:15] that it begins to wean itself off of
[1:53:17] that milk and it has to begin to get
[1:53:19] nutrients from outside sources sources
[1:53:22] that give it calcium sources that give
[1:53:24] it pottassium sources that give it
[1:53:26] sodium and on and on and on are you with
[1:53:28] me it has to continue to get this
[1:53:30] sources from different things because
[1:53:32] why she's going to get
[1:53:33] teeth and she's going to eat and she's
[1:53:36] going to grow and then you're going to
[1:53:38] watch her start to crawl around and we
[1:53:41] enjoy those times and and it's nothing
[1:53:43] nothing as cute as a little baby and
[1:53:45] watching it grow but wouldn't it be a
[1:53:47] tragedy if that baby just come to a
[1:53:49] certain spot in his life and just
[1:53:51] stopped
[1:53:53] think about it put the two types
[1:53:56] together what if you watch that baby
[1:53:58] grow for six months 18 months 24
[1:54:02] months three years old and all of a
[1:54:04] sudden that's as big as that baby gets
[1:54:06] you'd call a doctor wouldn't
[1:54:08] you why is it when people do it
[1:54:10] spiritually nobody seems to step in why
[1:54:14] is it when people do that spiritually
[1:54:16] it's not a concern anymore it's oh well
[1:54:18] they'll come back if God if they're one
[1:54:20] of
[1:54:21] Gods
[1:54:24] what are you doing what are we doing as
[1:54:26] Christians when we see people living in
[1:54:28] that Valley that they can't get out of
[1:54:30] they're stuck in a position and they're
[1:54:32] not growing that's right come on
[1:54:40] church God don't want his children to
[1:54:42] remain

[1:56:08] gracious you're not going to get that
[1:56:10] around the
[1:56:12] message if you
[1:56:15] are you're not going to get that around
[1:56:17] a real Holy Ghost filled Church why
[1:56:19] because God is more than just that if
[1:56:21] you want that you need to move to Texas
[1:56:23] and find you a pastor named
[1:56:26] Olin because he's a God is good all the
[1:56:30] time God's going to bless
[1:56:33] you God loves
[1:56:36] you God never does nothing to his
[1:56:39] children he he's just like a big
[1:56:42] granddaddy that's not what the prophet
[1:56:45] said and they find themselves they want
[1:56:48] that kind of preaching and they want to
[1:56:50] live that life with that little eaglet
[1:56:52] and and comfort but that's not the way
[1:56:54] God intended it brothers and sisters
[1:56:55] Eagles Are Born to
[1:56:57] Fly they sometime or another have to get
[1:57:00] out of that
[1:57:02] Nest how would you feel if your kids
[1:57:04] stay that you woke up one morning and
[1:57:06] your your children still living in the
[1:57:08] house and they're 45 years
[1:57:13] old at some point you have to get out of
[1:57:16] the nest at some point these Eagles have
[1:57:19] to get out of the nest and it's not
[1:57:21] because it's not because they want to
[1:57:23] but because it's an inheritance for them
[1:57:26] it's built inside of them there's
[1:57:28] something that God does on the inside of
[1:57:30] these little Eagles that says I can't
[1:57:32] lay here no more and their mama begins
[1:57:35] to talk to
[1:57:36] them she begins to talk to them and she
[1:57:39] begins to tell them hey we're fixing to
[1:57:41] get out of here scoot over let me pull
[1:57:44] some of this cushion out of
[1:57:46] here let me pull some of this God is
[1:57:49] good all the time out of here let me
[1:57:51] pull of this you'll never have problems
[1:57:54] out of
[1:57:55] here let me tell you you're fixing to
[1:57:57] find out where the rubber meets the road
[1:57:59] little
[1:58:00] iglet and she SS to him she tells them
[1:58:04] get on my
[1:58:07] wings and she begins to hover and she
[1:58:10] pushes and pushes air and and the
[1:58:12] prophet in the story goes that she
[1:58:14] pushes air and she knocks all the old
[1:58:16] feathers out of these little
[1:58:19] eaglets the feathers that'll do them no
[1:58:21] good
[1:58:24] and he begins to build up Faith and this
[1:58:27] Eagle is an inheritance in that eagle
[1:58:29] and it's our inherited as Believers in
[1:58:32] this message and God demands us to get
[1:58:34] out of the nest and fly to set our wings
[1:58:38] not on things of this
[1:58:40] world not on things around us but on
[1:58:44] things of a higher place of a higher
[1:58:51] calling
[1:58:52] listen to this real quick Prophet said
[1:58:54] God has set in the church
[1:58:57] gifts first the Bible he said 'I
[1:58:59] strictly a fundamentalist if anything
[1:59:01] doesn't come from the Bible it isn't
[1:59:02] true he said I believe that this is
[1:59:04] God's truth and everything every
[1:59:08] Doctrine must be based upon this new
[1:59:10] testament the New Testament Church now
[1:59:14] he said we see in the Bible that Jesus
[1:59:16] Christ the son of God when he came to
[1:59:18] the Earth he came to rid sin and
[1:59:21] sickness
[1:59:22] to divorce it to put it away forever
[1:59:25] from his people think about that and he
[1:59:29] said and he claimed that he would return
[1:59:34] again but in his
[1:59:38] absence that he gave his church the same
[1:59:42] Authority that he
[1:59:45] had brothers and sisters it's not up for
[1:59:47] us just to sit in the nest and hear the
[1:59:49] word and listen to the word and go to
[1:59:51] church and take our kids to
[1:59:53] camps it's up to us to get out of the
[1:59:56] nest to find ourselves with the same
[1:59:59] Authority that God Almighty has and do
[2:00:03] the works of a New Testament Church just
[2:00:05] like Paul just like
[2:00:07] Peter think about it think about those
[2:00:10] guys when they went into the streets and
[2:00:11] the people were healed upin the very
[2:00:14] Shadows that wasn't Jesus's
[2:00:17] Shadow it was a man of God it was a new
[2:00:21] testament Church
[2:00:26] believer brother Brown tells the story
[2:00:28] and you you're very familiar with it
[2:00:31] we're going to have to try to hurry now
[2:00:33] but he tells a story about that farmer
[2:00:35] who was walking one day and found that
[2:00:36] eagle
[2:00:38] egg everybody's heard this right if you
[2:00:41] hadn't hope you enjoy but that farmer
[2:00:43] walked down there and he found that
[2:00:45] Eagle's egg and he took that Eagle's egg
[2:00:47] and he placed it in the hen house under
[2:00:49] a settin hen and she had in there
[2:00:52] several eggs up under her at that time
[2:00:53] and and and all these eggs they just
[2:00:55] kind of sat there and they look the same
[2:00:58] but all of a sudden all the eggs began
[2:01:00] to
[2:01:02] hatch as the as these birds started to
[2:01:04] come forth the hen sitting there and she
[2:01:06] looks at it and she thinks man what is
[2:01:11] that and her way of thinking this is the
[2:01:13] oddest looking chicken I've ever
[2:01:18] seen you see we're odd
[2:01:20] boss you can try to scratch in the
[2:01:24] Barnard all you
[2:01:26] want but if this message is
[2:01:31] yours you're the oddest looking
[2:01:34] chicken the world's ever
[2:01:37] seen said this and and it's the oddest
[2:01:41] voice that that mother H had ever heard
[2:01:44] when she sit there she listen to her
[2:01:46] chicken
[2:01:46] [Applause]
[2:01:49] shirt you heard little chicks do that
[2:01:51] right right and here comes this odd
[2:01:53] looking
[2:01:55] [Music]
[2:02:00] one she's thinking my goodness what
[2:02:03] rooster got in this hand
[2:02:10] house what kind of bird is this this is
[2:02:14] something I've never seen
[2:02:16] before and this little bird this little
[2:02:19] this little eaglet sits down there and
[2:02:21] he's odd and all the others picked at
[2:02:23] him poked at him picked at
[2:02:27] him here was an eagle trying to live a
[2:02:30] life of a

[2:02:38] Baptist Church I didn't say you couldn't
[2:02:40] go I said could you be
[2:02:43] content I've been
[2:02:46] there you can't be
[2:02:49] content you can eat a little
[2:02:53] you can Fellowship a
[2:02:56] little but it's not the
[2:03:01] same the word does not do the
[2:03:07] same I'm not picking on just them I'm
[2:03:09] just picking on it I'm not picking on
[2:03:11] anybody don't don't take me that way but
[2:03:13] I'm just making an
[2:03:16] example with the message of the hour
[2:03:18] there's a there's there's there
[2:03:20] something different amen
[2:03:22] the word is brought to a life in a
[2:03:24] different kind of way that's why you're
[2:03:26] a to them you live different you walk
[2:03:28] different you look different you dress
[2:03:30] different you go different places you
[2:03:33] can't go where they go and be
[2:03:35] comfortable they can't do what you do
[2:03:37] and be
[2:03:39] comfortable you can't make an eagle a
[2:03:41] chicken and you can't make a chicken an
[2:03:44] eagle you can try all you want to reform
[2:03:47] to change but if it's not in there from
[2:03:49] the very foundation of the world it
[2:03:51] ain't for
[2:03:56] and this little chicken is out in the
[2:03:57] barnyard until one day a huge Shadow
[2:04:00] passes over the top of
[2:04:12] it and this huge Shadow passes over him
[2:04:15] and he looks up and he sees this eagle
[2:04:17] flying up in the sky and this big father

[2:05:43] on the fence
[2:05:45] [Music]
[2:05:50] post
[2:05:54] [Applause]
[2:05:56] that little
[2:05:57] eaglet he did what his father asked him
[2:05:59] to
[2:06:00] do and that father Eagle did what he
[2:06:03] said he would do he said if you'll take
[2:06:05] that Mighty jump of Faith you can land
[2:06:08] on my
[2:06:09] wings and I'll take you to places you've
[2:06:12] never
[2:06:13] seen you'll SAR to Heights that you've
[2:06:15] never

[2:06:19] you've never walked in before
[2:06:22] [Applause]
[2:06:24] there'll be no more
[2:06:25] doubt there'll be no more
[2:06:28] fear are you with
[2:06:31] me brother and sisters God as God called
[2:06:34] eaglet
[2:06:36] Christians we can't be content living
[2:06:38] the chicken life we can't be content
[2:06:41] living around in the
[2:06:45] barnyard because a barnyard believer is
[2:06:48] any attitude or mindset or lifestyle
[2:06:50] that restricts us
[2:06:52] from accomplishing all that God has
[2:06:55] purposed for us to be or do in
[2:07:01] [Music]
[2:07:03] [Applause]
[2:07:04] life that mother Eagle she trains her
[2:07:08] young to
[2:07:09] fly she watches these Eagles these
[2:07:12] eaglets until they're in the nest until
[2:07:13] they're fully feathered and when she
[2:07:15] thinks they're mature she begins to stir
[2:07:18] the
[2:07:19] nest listen to the message as the eagle
[2:07:22] stirreth her
[2:07:26] nest and she begins to stir her nest and
[2:07:28] with her beak she begins to tear out
[2:07:30] everything out of the nest and she gets
[2:07:32] rid of all the Cozy she removes all the
[2:07:34] padding she gets everything so
[2:07:36] uncomfortable and then in the process of
[2:07:39] helping them develop her wings she
[2:07:40] hovers over and begins to Flap and they
[2:07:42] watch
[2:07:44] her you see why it's so important that
[2:07:46] we're good
[2:07:48] examples you don't ever want to be a
[2:07:50] stumbling block to
[2:07:52] somebody but you want to be a steeping
[2:07:54] Stone you want to be somebody young
[2:07:55] people young teenagers be somebody that
[2:07:58] little ones look up to and say man I
[2:08:00] wish I could live like he
[2:08:02] lives now you may not be perfect
[2:08:05] nobody's going to ask you to be perfect
[2:08:07] but you're living a dedicated Christian
[2:08:09] Life and then Little Eagles they look at
[2:08:11] that mama bird and she's showing them
[2:08:12] exactly what to do live like this live
[2:08:16] like this live like this and she's
[2:08:19] sitting there she's flapping her wings
[2:08:21] and she showing them just what they're
[2:08:22] supposed to
[2:08:25] do and all of a sudden they begin to act
[2:08:28] like a
[2:08:30] belie they begin to talk like a Believer
[2:08:33] they begin to dress like a Believer they
[2:08:35] begin to go places like Believers go
[2:08:39] what is it they're watching they're
[2:08:40] learning they're strengthening their
[2:08:44] wings sometimes God has to stir our
[2:08:47] nest because we find ourselves as some
[2:08:50] of the most rooted Christians sometimes
[2:08:51] getting
[2:08:53] comfortable and getting
[2:08:55] complacent and we find ourselves not
[2:08:58] living exactly the way we should we We
[2:09:00] Begin to retract back from where we was
[2:09:03] two days ago instead of going forward we
[2:09:05] begin to step
[2:09:06] back and we have to be careful as
[2:09:09] Christians that we don't do that and God
[2:09:12] he begins to to get with his little
[2:09:13] eaglets and he stirs our nest and he
[2:09:15] says brothers and sisters we are meant
[2:09:17] to
[2:09:20] fly
[2:09:22] father
[2:09:23] eagle above us begins to
[2:09:34] call the truth is found in the mother
[2:09:36] Eagle spreading her wings and commanding
[2:09:38] her Eagles to step out in
[2:09:41] faith how many times has God ever called
[2:09:43] to you and it's a step of Faith it's a
[2:09:47] leap of faith God should I do this
[2:09:51] it's a leap of faith God should I should
[2:09:54] I do this should I witness this should I
[2:09:56] go here should I should I help this and
[2:09:59] you stepping out and you're leaping out
[2:10:00] in faith what are you doing you're
[2:10:03] stepping out on the wings of
[2:10:05] God the prophet said the wings are like
[2:10:08] the the old and the New
[2:10:10] Testament one Wings the Old Testament
[2:10:12] one's the New Testament and you're
[2:10:14] stepping out there in
[2:10:19] faith Deuteronomy 3 2 and 11 says Like
[2:10:22] an Eagle stirs her nest and hovers over
[2:10:24] young that spreads her wings to catch
[2:10:25] them and carries them to new
[2:10:33] heights listen what the prophet said I'm
[2:10:36] I'm closing now I'm not going to keep
[2:10:37] you long
[2:10:38] today he says what we need today is a
[2:10:41] nest stirring time what we need today is
[2:10:45] the power of the Holy Ghost he said what
[2:10:48] we need today is Eagle food preaching
[2:10:50] that Jesus Christ still heals he's the
[2:10:53] same The Works that I do shall you do
[2:10:57] also just
[2:10:59] like that father mother eagle flies let
[2:11:02] to know tonight that Jehovah has his big
[2:11:05] wings across here waving his Spirit back
[2:11:09] and forth and the angel of the Lord
[2:11:11] having his picture taken the same Pillar
[2:11:13] of Fire that was in the wilderness in
[2:11:15] the New Testament now in the last days

[2:11:18] forever and people being healed filled
[2:11:21] with the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues

[2:11:27] church together aren't you glad to be
[2:11:29] such a thing as
[2:11:31] that that's the life of the
[2:11:34] eagle he said it's called The Eagle
[2:11:39] age he said it's called God's prophets
[2:11:42] are eagles the eagle age we realize over
[2:11:45] the Bible we find Malachi 4 that we
[2:11:47] promised that in the last days he Likens
[2:11:50] His prophets to Eagles he calls himself
[2:11:52] an eagle he is the great Jehovah Eagle
[2:11:56] that's right listen now and he is able
[2:12:01] to achieve to himself a bride thank you
