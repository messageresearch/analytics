[14:36] Holy Spirit as your people come in Lord
[14:38] as they gather around as they find their
[14:40] places Lord as they center their hearts
[14:43] on you Lord Jesus and as they open up
[14:45] their hearts and minds to receive what

[15:06] to bring to your people, Father, so that
[15:08] the people might be fed, your sheep
[15:09] might be fed tonight, Lord. Tonight, we
[15:12] want to remember Sister Janette, Father,
[15:14] she was at the hospital and Father, for
[15:16] her breathing, couldn't breathe right,
[15:18] Lord. And the doctors don't know for
[15:20] sure if it's just the heart or if it's
[15:21] the lungs, Lord. But we're going to do
[15:23] test next week. And we ask God that you
[15:25] would just touch her and help them to be
[15:27] able to find out what's just what it is,
[15:29] Lord. And we ask God that your mighty
[15:31] hand Lord, your mighty healing power,
[15:33] your Holy Spirit would just touch her
[15:35] and Father, heal her, Lord. And we thank
[15:38] you, Father, for it, God. Lord Jesus, we
[15:40] ask those traveling tomorrow, God, that

[15:44] you'd give them traveling mercies. Keep
[15:46] the angels around about him, Father, and

[15:50] camp, at the meetings down in Louisiana
[15:52] this weekend, Lord. be with the
[15:54] ministers, Father, to help them to
[15:56] preach just exactly what you once said,
[15:58] Father. For we know that you are
[16:02] the control tower, Lord Jesus. You're
[16:04] the one that gives us the inspiration
[16:06] and what you want to say to us. Father,
[16:08] we just ask your blessing upon each one
[16:10] that has a need tonight, Lord. Brother
[16:12] Jeff's mother-in-law, we ask God that

[16:16] Lord Jesus. Bless her with healing, Lord
[16:18] Jesus, and for strength and life and
[16:20] that she might have joy, Lord. And we
[16:23] ask God that you'll bless each one now,
[16:24] Father, in Jesus' name. Everybody said,

[16:46] Bless you.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing who I am, Lord. who I
[16:52] am. Amen. I know I kind of have a
[16:54] reputation as making people stand for a
[16:56] long time, but some of these songs you
[16:59] just can't sit down and sing them. So,
[17:00] if y'all's knees hurt, your back hurt, I

[35:58] I believe we hitting on two and four
[35:59] tonight.
[36:01] [Music]
[36:03] Does everybody get that or it's a it's a
[36:06] drummer's thing. Okay. But man, y'all
[36:10] sound good tonight.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Here to praise the Lord.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; And uh it's not fair. You sang my
[36:17] favorite song and I'm pinned up in the
[36:19] back.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; And uh you know, my theophony was
[36:23] calling me, too.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; And so, we're looking forward to the to
[36:28] the word tonight. And I've got a little
[36:30] something I want to share with you.
[36:31] Won't you have your seats for just a
[36:33] minute?
[36:37] Let my eyes adjust here. I've been
[36:39] reading up close. You know, when you get
[36:40] over 40, if you read close, you can't
[36:44] see far away. If you look far away, you
[36:46] can't read up close. So, I have to have
[36:48] to find a balance in that there.
[36:53] So, uh you know, and I was thinking and
[36:56] getting ready to come and and studying
[36:57] out the word and trying to get ready for
[37:00] tonight's service. And I thought about
[37:02] this come to my mind. and thought, "Why
[37:05] are we why are we at church?
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Why why do why did you ask yourself, why
[37:10] did I come to church tonight?
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Is it just because it's a Wednesday
[37:18] night and it's the thing we're supposed
[37:20] to do?"
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Or do we come to church because we have
[37:23] a need? We we have a desire. We have we
[37:26] want something more from God. We're
[37:28] wanting We need a We need healing. We
[37:30] need deliverance. We need freedom from
[37:32] bondage. What is the reason? Why did you
[37:34] come through those doors tonight?
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Because I believe when we come through
[37:40] those doors with with an attitude of
[37:42] Lord, I'm here because I
[37:45] need I want I desire a closer walk with
[37:50] you. I desire a better relationship with
[37:52] you. I desire a a physical touch in my
[37:56] body.
[37:59] And we come with that attitude and not
[38:00] just, well, it's Wednesday night, so I'm
[38:02] going to church.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; But come with a need. Come with a
[38:05] desire. Come with with expectations. And
[38:08] see if God doesn't begin to meet your
[38:10] expectations in your life
[38:13] &gt;&gt; because he's there. That's what he
[38:15] wants. He wants to meet your
[38:17] expectations.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; You know, there's there's nothing
[38:20] greater than than a father that's able
[38:22] to when their child wants something to
[38:24] go in and just say, "I I want to do this
[38:26] for you, son. I want to do this for you,
[38:28] daughter, because I know I know you want
[38:30] this. I know you desire it. And and I
[38:32] want to meet those expectations because
[38:34] I'm able to do it.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; You know, WE GOT A GOD that's able to do
[38:39] &gt;&gt; above, beyond, and abundantly beyond
[38:42] what we could ever imagine.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; So, so when when we come into the house
[38:48] of God, let's ask ourselves, why am I
[38:51] really here?
[38:54] &gt;&gt; That that was just kind of free for you.
[38:56] But it it you know I thought about it. I
[38:58] thought that's the way I have to be.
[38:59] That's the way we all ministers have to
[39:01] come and say, 'Lord, how do you want to
[39:03] use me tonight? What are the needs of
[39:05] the people? You know, your prayers
[39:08] that you put before God inspires the
[39:11] minister on what to preach?
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Because we've all had writer's block. Is
[39:17] that right, Brother Baler? We be in a
[39:19] study and we're like, my goodness, I
[39:21] don't know what we're going to do
[39:22] tonight. I don't know what we're going
[39:23] to preach. I don't know what I'm going
[39:24] to say. I don't know what we're going to
[39:25] do.
[39:27] But then somebody begins to pray.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, I have this in my life. This is in
[39:33] my life. I need this. Lord, I have this
[39:35] desire. And then, you know, it works on
[39:37] a on a two-way line. It's and and and it
[39:40] goes up to the main line. It comes down
[39:41] and it begins to come into the heart of
[39:43] the preacher. And all of a sudden,
[39:45] you're going down avenues you never even
[39:47] be on never even imagined that you was
[39:50] going to be going down.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; For one,
[39:55] That's the way God works. I want to
[39:58] share this with you real quick as a as a
[40:00] testimony and and and a testimony of our
[40:03] church. You know, I I believe we're a a
[40:07] a church that is on fire and that is
[40:10] that the the Holy Ghost is moving in the
[40:12] lives of the people. We're seeing the
[40:14] manifestations
[40:16] of the power and demonstration of God in
[40:19] our church and in our lives, in our
[40:20] homes and our children, and in the
[40:23] people we come in contact with.
[40:26] We had prayer for a gentleman named Roy.
[40:30] Uh you might remember some here a while
[40:33] back and he was going to go he has
[40:34] prostate prostate cancer and and and it
[40:38] was it was the one we was telling you
[40:40] about and we had prayer for him and and
[40:41] they sent us an update. They'd been down
[40:43] to the Mayo Clinic and it says the the
[40:46] doctors at Mayo recommends Roy have more
[40:49] aggressive treatment.
[40:51] They're in alignment with the doctors in
[40:53] Houston. Hormone therapy radiation. We
[40:56] have an appointment with Vanderbilt on
[40:57] Friday. If you recall, she says
[40:59] Vanderbilt is reluctant to do radiation
[41:01] because it has metastasized to various
[41:04] areas. So Vanderbilt gives not a very
[41:07] good report.
[41:09] This is what she says next. However,
[41:13] Mayo Clinic did a new PSA test today and
[41:17] his PSA is 4.1, the lowest it has ever
[41:21] been.
[41:29] It gets better. She says, "We are
[41:31] believing God is hearing and answering
[41:34] your prayers."
[41:38] You see how God uses his people? He's
[41:41] believe we we believe in that God is
[41:43] hearing and answering your prayers.
[41:44] Thank you so much for all the prayers
[41:47] you have offered up on Royy's behalf. He
[41:49] is definitely sustaining us and we are
[41:52] confident that he will continue to guide
[41:54] us. Bless you.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; That was just coincidence. She said
[42:00] bless you.
[42:05] But that's how God is moving in the
[42:08] bride of Jesus Christ.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; The people we come in contact with, they
[42:12] begin to have confidence
[42:15] because of the life we live.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; They see the things that's happening in
[42:20] a church that's on fire where the Holy
[42:21] Ghost is moving in the people and the
[42:23] people are getting back to the original
[42:25] word. And we're seeing the manifestation
[42:27] and the power and demonstration of THE
[42:28] HOLY GHOST IN action in a church.
[42:34] I want to read this to you as we get
[42:36] ready to get started here
[42:39] and and this brother Brandham here and
[42:40] and then we'll stand for a reading of
[42:42] the word. We got several scriptures we
[42:43] want to go to, but I want to read this
[42:44] to you. We're getting back on our church
[42:46] ages uh series here and it says, "The
[42:48] end time evangelist message is from
[42:50] Malachi 4. It is a restoring. The
[42:55] message and messenger both will have to
[42:57] be a restoration of the faith." I
[43:00] believe that's what we're seeing.
[43:03] And he will restore the faith of the
[43:05] children back to or the faith of the
[43:07] children back to the fathers just before
[43:08] the destruction of time. What is it?
[43:11] It's a message that goes forth, a
[43:13] message and messenger of the last days.
[43:16] That's not to bring them to a creed. And
[43:19] we read this last time, but I want to
[43:20] read it again. BUT TO JERK THEM OUT OF
[43:23] THOSE creeds and bring them back to the
[43:26] original faith. THAT'S WHERE I WANTED TO
[43:28] GET TO THE ORIGINAL FAITH, BROTHERS and
[43:30] sisters. I'm looking for an ORIGINAL
[43:32] GOSPEL.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT LOOKING for some KIND OF
[43:35] COUNTERFEIT GOSPEL. I'M NOT LOOKING FOR
[43:37] A COUNTERFEIT RELIGION, a counterfeit
[43:39] healing, a counterfeit deliverance, a
[43:42] counterfeit salvation, but I'm looking
[43:45] for an original, SOMETHING THAT WILL
[43:47] STICK INTO the lives of me and the
[43:49] believers.
[43:53] the Pentecostal fathers where the church
[43:55] is to be in the last days. Not the
[43:58] Mosaic fathers, but the Pentecostal
[44:00] fathers. It's a message that'll go forth
[44:03] that'll what HE SAYS IT'LL RESTORE THE
[44:06] FAITH OF THE PEOPLE, the church today
[44:08] that's out of all these different
[44:10] corruptions and putrified and sword body
[44:13] of denominations.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; How many can say that's where we used to
[44:20] be?
[44:22] But it's getting it back to a living
[44:25] faith.
[44:27] It's not a dead faith.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; It's not something that's tucked away in
[44:30] a tomb or something that was in a days
[44:32] gone by, but it is a living faith and a
[44:35] living God. The message, listen to this.
[44:38] I think this is astonishing. The message
[44:41] has been going on for years.
[44:45] We talk about the message of the hour
[44:48] and he says the message has been going
[44:50] on for years. HE SAYS THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S
[44:53] time now that we should receive and
[44:56] believe the end time evangelism is to
[44:59] restore. Joel says in the book of Joel,
[45:02] I will restore all the years that the
[45:04] canker worm has eaten.
[45:08] He says TO RESTORE HIS BRIDE, THE ONE
[45:10] THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN in Eden, but she
[45:11] fell because she disbelieved
[45:14] the word.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; He says, "But here she's he he's going
[45:18] to restore a tree that will believe the
[45:20] word."
[45:25] &gt;&gt; You know, it does us no good
[45:28] to know the word, to read the word,
[45:31] study the word if we don't put the word
[45:33] in action.
[45:36] If the word DOES NOT BECOME ALIVE ON THE
[45:38] INSIDE, what good does it do TO HAVE IT?
[45:42] &gt;&gt; KNOWLEDGE IS NO good if you don't
[45:44] deliver what you know.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; So here believe the word and she'll come
[45:52] up on the day on the day of Pentecost
[45:54] that original doctrine that original
[45:57] faith. But what did Rome do? He says,
[46:00] "Rome then comes in and they begin to
[46:03] send in a cankerworm
[46:05] and they send in a palmer worm and they
[46:08] begin to come in here and they begin to
[46:09] eat eat his part off the fruit and they
[46:13] eat the leaves and they eat EVERYTHING
[46:15] AND THEY SUCKED IT all down."
[46:19] &gt;&gt; So man-made religion comes into the
[46:21] original word of God. THE WORD OF GOD
[46:24] THAT WAS JESUS CHRIST IN action in the
[46:27] apostles. JESUS CHRIST IN action in the
[46:30] believers.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; And now the message has now become
[46:34] distorted by man-made ideas. And these
[46:36] worms are eating and eating and eating
[46:38] and gnawing and gnawing.
[46:41] Now if you think that is just a simple
[46:43] thing, let me tell you how many's ever
[46:45] seen a field full of army worms.
[46:48] Has anybody ever seen it? I witnessed
[46:49] it. It is the most amazing, frustrating,
[46:53] discouraging thing that you'll ever see.
[46:57] our whole back back field. We had it
[47:00] looking good. It was green. It was full.
[47:02] It was lush. It was just beautiful a
[47:04] couple years ago. And I begin to look
[47:07] out there one morning. I'm watching
[47:10] and it's getting brown. It's just like a
[47:12] strip and it's getting brown and it's
[47:15] getting brown. AND AS AS TIME GOES ON,
[47:17] WITHIN HOURS, these worms, these army
[47:21] worms have begun to eat in our field.
[47:23] AND THEY START AT ONE end and they just
[47:25] go and they devour
[47:29] &gt;&gt; whatever is in their way. If it's green,
[47:32] it's dead.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And so our whole field, we could just
[47:36] watch it just like it was just like
[47:37] moving like a wave of of of of uh
[47:40] destruction coming across the field. And
[47:43] that's what has happened in the with the
[47:46] word of God over time. man has went in
[47:48] and they begin to devour it with their
[47:50] man-made traditions, their man-made
[47:52] theologies,
[47:54] &gt;&gt; THEIR IDEAS THAT THEY want to live by,
[47:58] &gt;&gt; instead of sticking to the root word.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; This is the greenery. This is the life.
[48:06] [Applause]
[48:07] &gt;&gt; This is what sustains YOU. THIS IS THE
[48:09] WATER OF THE WORD. AMEN.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; And yet the canker worms and the palmer
[48:15] worms and they come in and they eat and
[48:17] they eat and they take out and they
[48:18] destroy and THEY BEGIN TO PICK APART the
[48:20] word the way they want it to read.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; It's a destruction that's taking place
[48:31] across the land. Stand with me for the
[48:34] reading of the word if you could. We we
[48:36] went a completely different direction
[48:38] from where we was going to. We were
[48:40] going to talk about Job and somebody
[48:42] didn't want to talk about Job. So,
[48:48] we're still going to talk about
[48:49] restoration, but we're going in a
[48:50] different direction. Turn with me if you
[48:52] would to Ecclesiastes chapter 3.
[48:57] If Brother Devin get that up, it would
[48:59] sure help me.
[49:01] There we go. And verse 14 and 15.
[49:11] I know that whatsoever God doeth, it
[49:14] shall be forever.
[49:17] Now, that didn't say for a short period
[49:18] of time, did it?
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Forever. Nothing can be put to it, nor
[49:23] any taken from it, and God doeth it that
[49:26] men should fear before him. That which
[49:30] hath been is now, and that which is to
[49:32] be hath already been. And God requireth
[49:35] that which is past.
[49:39] Hebrews chapter 13.
[49:43] Familiar scripture. Very familiar
[49:45] scripture. Jesus Christ the same
[49:48] yesterday,
[49:49] today,
[49:51] and
[49:53] &gt;&gt; forever.
[49:55] Be not carried about with diverse and
[49:58] strange doctrines, the Palmer worm, the
[50:00] canker worm. For it is a good thing that
[50:03] the heart be established with grace, not
[50:06] with meats which have not profited them
[50:09] that have been occupied therein. Last
[50:12] one, John 1 and one
[50:16] 1-5. In the beginning was the word, and
[50:19] the word was with God, and the word was
[50:20] God. The same was in the beginning with
[50:23] God. All things were made by him, and
[50:26] without him was not anything made that
[50:29] was made.
[50:31] In him was life.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; In him was life,
[50:37] &gt;&gt; and the life was the light of men, and
[50:40] the light shineth in darkness, and
[50:42] darkness comprehended it not. Let's just
[50:46] pray. Heavenly Father, we come before
[50:48] you tonight and we just thankful for uh
[50:51] the service thus far, Lord. And we just
[50:53] ask that you continue to move and bless
[50:55] and anoint anoint the speaker tonight,
[50:57] Lord, that I could get myself out of the
[50:59] way and just take this these broken
[51:01] thoughts that you've placed on my heart
[51:03] and deliver it to the needy hearts that
[51:05] have need of it tonight, Lord. And I
[51:07] raise my hand and say, "Lord, I need it.
[51:08] I need more of you. I need more
[51:10] revelation. I need more uh uh more uh
[51:13] discipline in this hour. I need more uh
[51:15] of a closer walk with you, Father. So
[51:18] Lord, bless us tonight with your
[51:19] presence and your word tonight. We love
[51:22] you. We give you honor, praise, and
[51:23] glory. And may everything we say and do
[51:25] and the worship and the praise at the
[51:27] end of service just bring glory to you
[51:30] and be pleasing to your ears tonight,
[51:32] Lord. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[51:36] You can have your seats.
[51:44] Now, in laying a foundation tonight, I
[51:46] want to take a a thought and speak
[51:48] briefly on a topic that's been in the
[51:50] news lately. And and you know, I I was
[51:53] looking at this and I I began to think
[51:54] about it and you know, we have a
[51:56] Secretary of Defense or Secretary of War
[51:59] we call him now. I kind of like it that
[52:01] way. But, uh, we have a Secretary of War
[52:04] defense, Pete Hegsth. And Pete Hexth,
[52:07] how many has kept up with anything in
[52:09] the news in the last two weeks? Few
[52:11] hands.
[52:12] But Pete Hexth, who is a secretary of
[52:15] defense, became the secretary in January
[52:17] of 25 this year. So this last couple of
[52:21] weeks, he calls in all of the generals
[52:23] into the military and all the flagged
[52:25] officers, everybody of importance, of
[52:28] leadership, and he calls them into
[52:31] Quantico, Virginia. Now, you can imagine
[52:34] the rumors going around. We're fixing to
[52:36] start World War II. This is happening.
[52:38] Russia's doing this. Russia's doing
[52:39] that. It had nothing to do with that.
[52:42] But his whole commission, his whole his
[52:44] whole directive was aimed at a project
[52:46] that he called restoring military
[52:50] standards.
[52:55] Restoring military standards. NOW, THIS
[52:59] STANDARD IS SOMETHING THAT HE wanted to
[53:01] he wanted to put it out across THE WHOLE
[53:04] UNITED STATES armed services. He he he
[53:07] put these in place and he wants to look
[53:09] at this and he wants to to change the
[53:11] focus of physical fitness, of grooming,
[53:14] of training, and he wants to eliminate
[53:17] policies related to diversity and
[53:19] inclusion.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; You think, man, where in the world are
[53:25] you going with this?
[53:28] BUT HE HAS PUT THESE STANDARDS OF
[53:30] PRACTICE IN PLACE THAT THE ARMY HAS TO
[53:32] follow this standard. The Navy has to
[53:34] follow this standard. And I'm assuming
[53:36] the Air Force has to follow this
[53:38] standard.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:41] The Marines have to follow a standard.
[53:44] And he says he begins to look at this
[53:46] and he's beginning to GET THEM INTO A
[53:47] PLACE. WHY? HE'S WANTING TO GET THEM
[53:49] BACK TO A STANDARD, TO A WAY of living
[53:52] that everybody IS FOLLOWING THE WORD THE
[53:55] WAY IT WAS WRITTEN. AND HE'S TALKING
[53:58] ABOUT HE WANTS TO GET RID of the
[53:59] diversity and the inclusion. And that's
[54:02] what we need. WE NEED PREACHERS IN THIS
[54:04] HOUR WHO will stand BEHIND THE PULLPIT
[54:07] AND TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH AND THE WORD
[54:09] THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN AND THE way it
[54:11] was delivered on the day of Pentecost.
[54:15] AND QUIT LETTING PEOPLE DIVERT THE WORD
[54:17] TO THE WAY THEY LIKE IT.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; THEY DIVERT THIS WAY AND THEY DIVERT
[54:22] THAT WAY. AND CHRISTIANITY IS an
[54:24] inclusive deal anymore.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, HEAVEN IS NOT AN
[54:30] ALL-INCLUSIVE RESORT.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING.
[54:40] But the WORLD LOOKS AT IT AND THEY CLAIM
[54:42] Christianity fits everybody.
[54:49] Aussie Osburn
[54:53] and tell how many souls he sent to hell
[54:59] with his music, his image.
[55:03] But you know, somebody said, "I got to
[55:05] witness to him at the very end." and and
[55:06] and he he he said he loved the Lord and
[55:09] and I gave him a Bible and I hope he
[55:13] did.
[55:15] I hope he did.
[55:18] But not everybody's going.
[55:22] Not everybody's going. So as Pete Hegth
[55:26] begin to put this out,
[55:29] some of the generals liked him, some of
[55:32] them love him, some of them hate him.
[55:37] But he's got a standard.
[55:40] So I'm not here to debate or question
[55:41] tonight whether we like him, love him,
[55:43] or hate him. That's not that's not the
[55:44] story. But what we're looking at
[55:46] tonight, BUT WHAT I WOULD DO want to see
[55:48] is the key principles that he
[55:50] introduced.
[55:51] Pete Hgse did not introduce something
[55:54] that he just came up with.
[55:56] HE DID NOT MANUFACTURE A SET OF
[55:59] STANDARDS that said, "Well, I think I
[56:00] want to do it this way because I'm the
[56:02] Secretary of War. I'm the Secretary of
[56:04] Defense. I WANT THIS TO be the standard.
[56:07] He didn't come UP WITH THAT. HE didn't
[56:09] dream this up or manufacture this and
[56:11] say, "Oh, I think this WOULD WORK
[56:12] BETTER. I think we would have a better a
[56:15] better church if this would happen."
[56:20] &gt;&gt; He didn't do that. But when we look AT
[56:23] WHAT HE DID, HE TOOK A SET OF
[56:25] GUIDELINES.
[56:26] HE TOOK A SET OF GUIDELINES THAT WERE
[56:28] ESTABLISHED
[56:30] THAT WERE ESTABLISHED YEARS and years
[56:32] and years ago. AND THEY WERE ESTABLISHED
[56:34] TO PREPARE SOLDIERS FOR THE BATTLE AND
[56:37] FOR A WAR THAT WAS BEING FOUGHT ON A
[56:39] BATTLEFIELD.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; We didn't come one OF THE MO WE didn't
[56:45] become one of the most uh most dominant
[56:47] militaries in in in the history of the
[56:49] world
[56:51] by being dirty,
[56:53] &gt;&gt; by being lazy,
[56:56] &gt;&gt; by not studying our enemy.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; So why is it okay for Christians to walk
[57:01] that way?
[57:04] WHY IS IT OKAY FOR US TO TO TO TO GET
[57:07] DOY on the WORD TO GET DOY AND TO PULL
[57:09] BACK AND NOT REALLY GET IN there and dig
[57:11] into the WORD OR TO STAY ON FIRE?
[57:14] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, HE'S requiring these guys to
[57:16] exercise twice a day or daily and then
[57:19] come in for a physical fitness test
[57:20] every six months AND IF THEY DON'T PASS,
[57:22] they be reprimanded and they're put on a
[57:24] probation period.
[57:28] What if God done that for us? Brother
[57:30] Ver, did you read your Bible today?
[57:34] Don't answer.
[57:37] Don't Don't I'm not Don't get the rope.
[57:42] Did you read your Bible today? Did you
[57:44] pray today?
[57:49] Six months down the road, what have you
[57:50] done?
[57:54] Hey, we all have to have stuff to keep
[57:56] us on track.
[57:58] I got this app, y'all. I've been trying
[58:01] to read the Bible in a year, and I and I
[58:04] do it, but I I I don't know that I'd do
[58:06] it in a year because I lose track. So, I
[58:09] got this app now. You know, this this
[58:11] right here, this phone can be the the
[58:13] best thing or the worst thing.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; So, I got this app here,
[58:18] Holy Bible, Bible, my plan. That's what
[58:21] I got. My plan. Bible in a year. 365 day
[58:25] reading plan. I just started it in the
[58:26] middle of the month last month. I'm 23
[58:28] days in. I'm one day ahead. I like it
[58:30] when it says I'm one day ahead.
[58:35] Cuz I have seen it when it says uh
[58:37] you're behind.
[58:39] But we need things to keep us on track.
[58:41] AND THAT'S THE WAY THE MILITARY HAS
[58:43] BECOME. THEY begin to PUT OUT THIS
[58:45] BLUEPRINT. AND IT'S A BLUEPRINT THAT WAS
[58:47] PROVEN. IT'S BEEN TESTED. IT'S BEEN
[58:49] TRIED WHEN OUR MILITARY WAS AT ITS PEAK.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Now listen, I'm not trying to get
[58:54] political tonight. That's not what I'M
[58:56] TRYING TO DO. BUT I DO want us to
[58:58] realize THAT THIS THESE POLICIES, THEY
[59:00] MANDATE PHYSICAL training for SERVICE
[59:02] MEMBERS. WE NEED PHYSICAL TRAINING as
[59:05] men and women, sons and DAUGHTERS OF
[59:08] GOD. WE NEED TO TRAIN OURSELVES TO THE
[59:10] WORD so that WHEN THE WORD GOES FORTH,
[59:13] &gt;&gt; we hear the word and we know the word.
[59:20] Because many times I'm afraid that we
[59:22] get so caught up in in the the preaching
[59:24] of the word that sometimes we amen when
[59:26] we should say oh me.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; So we have to have our ears trained to
[59:34] the word.
[59:35] NOW I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS brothers
[59:37] and sisters. I was thinking on this
[59:38] department of defense versus department
[59:41] of war because you know it was a big
[59:42] thing. WE DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED THE
[59:44] DEPARTMENT of war. It looks like we're
[59:45] out to fight everybody. Like we're
[59:47] trying to dominate everybody. We're just
[59:49] a Department of Defense. It was
[59:51] originally called the Department of War.
[59:53] Am I right?
[59:54] &gt;&gt; You military guys, look at they shaking.
[59:56] They like this. I'm preaching down their
[59:58] alley tonight.
[1:00:00] IT WAS CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR. And
[1:00:04] I got to thinking about that and I
[1:00:06] thought, you know what? We as
[1:00:08] Christians,
[1:00:09] we are in a spiritual warfare tonight.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; WE LIVE EVERY DAY WE GET UP OUT OF THE
[1:00:15] BED AND OUR FEET HIT THE FLOOR. WE ARE
[1:00:17] IN A WAR. WE ARE IN A BATTLE. AND I
[1:00:20] DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I don't always
[1:00:22] want to be on the defense.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; When you're in THE DEFENSE, YOU'RE
[1:00:27] ALWAYS TAKING BLOWS.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ALWAYS TAKING BLOWS. WHEN YOU'RE
[1:00:34] ON THE DEFENSE, you say, "Well, a boxer
[1:00:37] PUTS UP HIS GUARD AND HE'S GUARDING
[1:00:38] HIMSELF." WE GOT THE SHIELD OF WE GOT
[1:00:40] the shield of faith. We got
[1:00:41] righteousness. We got truth. WE GOT
[1:00:43] PRAYER. WE GOT ALL OF THOSE WEAPONS.
[1:00:45] WE'VE GOT THE WORD OF GOD, BUT WHAT GOOD
[1:00:48] DOES IT DO YOU TO HAVE THE WORD OF GOD
[1:00:50] IF YOU NEVER swing your sword?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; And we SIT BACK AND WE DEFEND against
[1:00:59] everything.
[1:01:01] Oh, the devil's hitting my my finances.
[1:01:04] Oh, the devil, he's he's hitting my
[1:01:06] children. The devil's hitting my home,
[1:01:09] my marriage. The devil's hitting ME OVER
[1:01:12] HERE. I I'VE lost my zeal.
[1:01:16] You're putting up your guard and you're
[1:01:18] taking lick after lick after lick. You
[1:01:21] ever seen a boxer? They put them in the
[1:01:22] ropes and they just wear them out. Some
[1:01:25] of us let the devil throw us in the
[1:01:27] ROPES AND JUST WEAR us out.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; WHY
[1:01:35] QUIT LIVING AS A DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
[1:01:38] AND FIND YOURSELF AS A DEPARTMENT OF WAR
[1:01:41] AND FIGHT YOUR BATTLES? PULL OUT THE
[1:01:44] SWORD.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[1:01:53] but against principalities.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; You see, the life of the believer
[1:02:00] is against spiritual enemies.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; And we don't have to back down from
[1:02:05] these enemies.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Listen what the word
[1:02:09] says. Finally, my brethren, be strong in
[1:02:10] the LORD, IN THE POWER OF HIS MIGHT. PUT
[1:02:12] ON THE WHOLE ARMOR of God
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; that you may be able to STAND AGAINST
[1:02:20] THE WS OF THE DEVIL. For we wrestle not
[1:02:22] against flesh and blood blood, against
[1:02:24] principalities, against powers and
[1:02:25] rulers of the darkness of this world,
[1:02:27] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:02:28] places. Therefore take unto you the
[1:02:31] whole armor.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; The whole armor, truth,
[1:02:41] righteousness,
[1:02:43] peace,
[1:02:45] salvation.
[1:02:47] This is the armor, the word of God.
[1:02:53] And when you've done all to withstand in
[1:02:55] the evil day, having done all to stand,
[1:02:59] stand therefore.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; You know, when you you look at the
[1:03:03] military and you look at the the
[1:03:04] military uh attire of the day that this
[1:03:07] is being described, you're putting on
[1:03:09] the whole armor, you got your helmet,
[1:03:10] you got your shield, you got your sword,
[1:03:12] YOU GOT ALL THIS armor on the front, but
[1:03:15] you KNOW WHERE YOU'RE NOT COVERED up
[1:03:18] in the back.
[1:03:20] YOU SEE, GOD DOESN'T PLAN ON HIS
[1:03:22] CHILDREN fleeing from the scene of THE
[1:03:24] BATTLE.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY GET DOWN. YOU MAY GET KNOCKED
[1:03:28] DOWN. YOU MAY FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DEPRESSED
[1:03:30] and defeated and you've been been
[1:03:32] OVERTAKEN BY THE ENEMY, BUT YOU NEVER
[1:03:35] TURN YOUR BACK.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TOO EXPOSED STANDING FACE TO FACE
[1:03:39] AND SAY, "GOD, HELP ME FIGHT THIS
[1:03:41] BATTLE.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I stand on THE WORD OF GOD, SO HELP ME
[1:03:46] FIGHT THIS BATTLE.
[1:03:51] The question was asked,
[1:03:55] why does the military have standards?
[1:03:59] This was this was when I was researching
[1:04:01] this, I found this question and I
[1:04:02] thought this is pretty good.
[1:04:05] Why does the military have standards?
[1:04:09] And the response to the question was
[1:04:12] this.
[1:04:14] Standards and discipline are the bedrock
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; of military operations.
[1:04:22] They are vital for maintaining order,
[1:04:25] unit cohesion, ensuring readiness, and
[1:04:29] achieving mission success.
[1:04:33] I don't know about y'all, but I'm
[1:04:34] planning on taking a rapture.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; I'm planning on leaving this world, and
[1:04:38] I'm planning to do whatever IT TAKES TO
[1:04:40] BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT MISSION. SO WHAT I
[1:04:43] NEED IS I NEED A WORD THAT STANDS UPON
[1:04:45] THE ROCK UPON THE WORD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:04:48] THIS BEDROCK, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WHY
[1:04:50] WOULD THEY SAY BEDROCK? THEY SAID
[1:04:52] BEDROCK BECAUSE BEDROCK is considered
[1:04:54] the earth's foundation.
[1:04:57] When you get into A LAYER OF BEDROCK,
[1:04:59] IT'S A WELL cemented layer of rock and
[1:05:01] it MAKES A CONTINUOUS FOUNDATION through
[1:05:04] the earth's crust. This bedrock layer
[1:05:07] that there there is nothing that can
[1:05:09] break it. It doesn't change. It doesn't
[1:05:12] waver. IT DOESN'T RATTLE. ARE YOU WITH
[1:05:14] ME?
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO BE ON THE WORD OF GOD
[1:05:17] TONIGHT. THE ROCK OF THE HOUR. BROTHERS
[1:05:19] AND SISTERS, GOD IS looking for a group
[1:05:21] of believers in this end time
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; that are building their life on a firm
[1:05:28] foundation of the word of God and the
[1:05:30] life of Jesus Christ.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; You see, upon this layer of bedrock,
[1:05:37] there's all kinds of loose sediment.
[1:05:40] There's sand, there's pebbles,
[1:05:43] there there's there's material that
[1:05:45] won't pack and won't stay tight. And
[1:05:48] it's they call it loose sediment,
[1:05:51] but that don't change the bedrock.
[1:05:55] You see, as believers, you may have to
[1:05:58] be out there around people in the world
[1:05:59] that's loose living. You may be
[1:06:02] surrounded by loose living people,
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; but you have to be solid as bedrock. You
[1:06:10] have to be solid as bedrock. WHEN I
[1:06:12] NEEDED SALVATION, WHO DID I GO TO?
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; The rock.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; When I needed A FRIEND, WHO DID I GO TO?
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; The Rock.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; When I needed When I needed a shelter,
[1:06:26] WHO DID I GO TO? THE ROCK. WHEN I NEED
[1:06:29] AN ANSWER IN LIFE, WHO DO I GO TO?
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; The Rock.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; He's the rock of my salvation.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; The Rock is where I stand. The song
[1:06:39] says, "When the winds of sorrow blew
[1:06:41] blow and and who do I go to? I go to the
[1:06:43] rock
[1:06:47] in the church age book in Ephesians
[1:06:49] church age part verse three or paragraph
[1:06:52] 3." He says, "The key given to me of the
[1:06:55] word of the Lord whereby I was able to
[1:06:57] determine the messenger for each age is
[1:06:59] a most scriptural one. In fact, it might
[1:07:02] be called the keystone in the Bible."
[1:07:07] How many knows what a keystone is?
[1:07:15] MJ's the only one in this building knows
[1:07:17] what a keystone is. Well, you're going
[1:07:19] to know tonight.
[1:07:22] The keystone is a central wedgehaped
[1:07:25] stone at the apex of an arch. So, if you
[1:07:29] want to know what a keystone looks like,
[1:07:31] when you go out of the building tonight,
[1:07:32] you look at these four windows right
[1:07:34] here. There's brick work that goes up
[1:07:36] the side. And as the bricks begin to
[1:07:38] turn up the arch, there is a there is a
[1:07:41] limestone looking
[1:07:43] rock or stone that sets up there that
[1:07:45] looks like this. It's wedge shaped and
[1:07:48] it goes in there and it wedges into
[1:07:50] those brick.
[1:07:52] Now that plays a very important system
[1:07:54] in that and the part of that the
[1:07:55] function because the keystone is the
[1:07:57] final stone that is placed into the arch
[1:08:01] or a vault. So here the builders go up
[1:08:04] and they take this and they begin to
[1:08:05] build up up up up up up up up up up up
[1:08:06] up up up up up up up up up up up up up
[1:08:06] up up up up up up up up up up up up up
[1:08:06] up up up up up up up up up up up up up
[1:08:06] up up up up up up up up up up up up up
[1:08:06] up up up up up up up up up up up up up
[1:08:06] up up up up up up up and they begin and
[1:08:07] then they stick this wedge this stone
[1:08:10] down in the brick. Now the weight of all
[1:08:14] of the building is now resting on that
[1:08:16] keystone.
[1:08:18] Do you see how important the keystone
[1:08:20] is? The weight of the entire building.
[1:08:23] It has to bear THE LOAD. AND WITHOUT the
[1:08:26] keystone, the arch collapses, the
[1:08:29] building collapses, the rest of the
[1:08:31] brick comes down and loses because all
[1:08:33] of the support is GONE AND IT FALLS.
[1:08:36] BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE HAVE A keystone
[1:08:38] message.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET TELLS US THAT THE
[1:08:41] KEYSTONE OF THE BIBLE, YOU WANT TO KNOW
[1:08:43] WHAT IT IS. How many wants to know what
[1:08:45] the keystone of the Bible is? He says
[1:08:48] the keystone is the REVELATION THAT GOD
[1:08:51] NEVER CHANGES.
[1:08:54] THAT GOD NEVER CHANGES HIS WAYS and are
[1:08:56] unchangeable and and his ways are
[1:08:59] unchangeable as he is. And he goes back
[1:09:02] to Hebrews 13 and 8 and he goes back to
[1:09:04] Ecclesiastes 3 and he begins to read
[1:09:07] those scriptures and he SAYS HERE IT IS
[1:09:09] with an exclamation point. Here it is
[1:09:11] the unchanging God with unchanging ways.
[1:09:16] WHAT HE DID AT THE FIRST.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; What he did at the first,
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; he says he will have to keep on doing
[1:09:23] until it's done for the last time.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; The message that's been going around the
[1:09:32] world since
[1:09:34] the days of Paul, the message that's
[1:09:37] been going around since 53,
[1:09:41] not 1953,
[1:09:43] 53.
[1:09:46] The message that's been going around,
[1:09:48] the keystone revelation is that God
[1:09:52] never changes.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; That message keeps going and going and
[1:09:58] going.
[1:10:00] It's a beautiful picture. It's beautiful
[1:10:02] when you begin to look at it. And he
[1:10:04] says, "There will never be a change."
[1:10:06] AND HE SAYS, "APPLY THAT TO the church
[1:10:08] ages."
[1:10:10] Can you imagine God's word, God's
[1:10:13] revelation, God and who he is and God's
[1:10:15] unchanging ways? If he's a healer then,
[1:10:18] he's a healer now. If he's a deliverer
[1:10:20] then, he's a deliverer now.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; If he's gives you freedom then, he gives
[1:10:24] you freedom now.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; And it keeps going AND IT KEEPS GOING.
[1:10:29] MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE, AGE after age
[1:10:31] after age, it's never changed one time.
[1:10:40] He said, "Apply that to the church
[1:10:43] ages." The kind of man that God chose
[1:10:44] for the first age and how God manifested
[1:10:47] in that man's ministry would be an
[1:10:49] example for all other ages. SO WHAT GOD
[1:10:54] DID IN THE FIRST CHURCH age is what he
[1:10:56] listen what he wants to do in all other
[1:11:00] ages.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; He wants to do this. We read the Bible
[1:11:06] stories. We hear the things that
[1:11:07] happened. We hear the the the incredible
[1:11:10] stories.
[1:11:12] THESE ARE NOT JUST FAKE STORIES. THIS IS
[1:11:15] NOT FAKE NEWS. This is not CNN.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOD MOVING DOWN THROUGH TIME AND
[1:11:22] delivering his people. So, HE WANTS TO
[1:11:24] BE YOUR HEALER. HE WANTS to be your
[1:11:27] freedom giver.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; He wants to be all these things. He
[1:11:31] wants to move in you.
[1:11:36] You say, "Well, I didn't want it."
[1:11:38] Neither did Paul.
[1:11:41] Did you realize that the messenger of
[1:11:44] the first age, Paul, is going down the
[1:11:48] road
[1:11:49] name was Saul?
[1:11:51] And he's going down the road and HE'S
[1:11:53] GOING TO PERSECUTE EVERYBODY that stands
[1:11:56] for Jesus.
[1:12:00] Do you realize that he didn't want to be
[1:12:02] the first age messenger?
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; That's not what he was WANT TO DO. HE
[1:12:08] WAS WANTING TO STAND FIRM ON WHAT HE
[1:12:10] BELIEVED.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; HE WANTED TO TAKE THE MESSAGE AS HE
[1:12:14] understood it.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; But God says, "I can restore you, Paul.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; I CAN RESTORE YOU THE WAY I WANT TO BE
[1:12:24] IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. I CAN BRING you
[1:12:26] all the WAY BACK." SO HERE PAUL, WHY DO
[1:12:30] YOU PERSECUTE? SAUL, WHY DO YOU
[1:12:31] PERSECUTE against me?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:12:39] you know when he heard that voice, it
[1:12:41] was a different kind of atmosphere.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, AND WHAT DID GOD DO? GOD HAD TO
[1:12:47] BLIND HIM AND stricken him blind for
[1:12:49] what? Three days.
[1:12:53] And Ananas came and prayed for him,
[1:12:55] right? And Ananas WAS AFRAID BECAUSE HE
[1:12:58] WAS AFRAID OF WHAT SAUL WAS GOING TO DO
[1:13:00] TO HIM because he was going to persecute
[1:13:01] people like Ananas.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAYS, "I'M GOING TO USE SOMEBODY
[1:13:07] LIKE YOU, PAUL. I'm going to use
[1:13:09] somebody like you." AND HE BEGINS TO GO
[1:13:11] AND he begins to work and through and
[1:13:13] move through Paul through the life of
[1:13:15] the first age messenger Paul. And he
[1:13:18] begins to take THE MESSAGE AND HE takes
[1:13:20] the word. And the prophet said, "We know
[1:13:22] exactly what the word was because it was
[1:13:25] recorded by the Holy Spirit in the
[1:13:27] original church."
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He said it was founded
[1:13:36] in the original church and it was
[1:13:38] founded and God how God manifested
[1:13:40] himself in her.
[1:13:43] Did you hear what I said?
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; In her.
[1:13:48] HE DIDN'T SAY, "AND GOD MANIFESTED
[1:13:50] himself in Paul and Peter and James and
[1:13:52] John and Mark and the rest of the
[1:13:54] apostles," but he said he manifested
[1:13:56] himself in her.
[1:14:00] So who is her?
[1:14:02] Who is her? It's a common misconception
[1:14:06] that the bride of Christ is only in the
[1:14:08] last age.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; We talk better than that.
[1:14:17] BUT IT'S A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT
[1:14:19] PEOPLE THINK, "OH, THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:14:21] CHRIST IS IN THE LAST church age. That's
[1:14:23] all the bride is." But he says, "No, God
[1:14:25] manifested himself in her. That her WAS
[1:14:28] THE BRIDE OF THAT DAY. THAT'S WHO IT
[1:14:30] WAS. IT was the true believers from
[1:14:32] every age before us, every church age,
[1:14:35] Samrna, Pergamma, Thyra, Tatyra, Sardis,
[1:14:39] Philip, Leotaa.
[1:14:42] There was bride in every single age.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; You see how big? But what how how can
[1:14:50] you say that? Well, I'll tell you what
[1:14:51] he said. The message has been going
[1:14:54] around
[1:14:56] and around
[1:14:59] and around.
[1:15:01] So there was people aund years ago,
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; 150 years ago that we never knew. Maybe
[1:15:06] some of your family, your great great
[1:15:08] great granddaddy. Maybe you had a great
[1:15:10] great great uncle.
[1:15:13] Maybe you got one that was in jail and
[1:15:14] you got one that was a believer. But
[1:15:17] that message was going around and around
[1:15:21] and around.
[1:15:24] He says, "Now there is a false bride."
[1:15:27] And we see her in Revelation 17. He
[1:15:29] said, ' But now the true bride will be
[1:15:31] made up of thousands
[1:15:34] times thousands of people.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; It will be the elect out of every church
[1:15:41] age.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine, brothers and sisters?
[1:15:46] CAN YOU IMAGINE the length of the
[1:15:48] marriage table supper uh t supper table
[1:15:52] thousands of miles long?
[1:15:56] Brother Baller.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; We made it.
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Come see me when you get time.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; I'll be there in a few thousand years.
[1:16:24] BUT BELIEVERS FROM THOUSANDS OF
[1:16:26] THOUSANDS OF BELIEVERS and he says what
[1:16:28] was it? It was from every age. Every
[1:16:30] time a message went forth the people
[1:16:33] believed it and accepted it in the light
[1:16:35] that it was.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Now what does that say for us?
[1:16:42] We've got more light.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; We got more accountability.
[1:16:51] WE GOT MORE TO STAND ON. WE GOT MORE TO
[1:16:53] BELIEVE IN. WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO TO
[1:16:55] STAND A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN what they
[1:16:57] did, but they saw everything that was in
[1:17:00] their day and in their light. And he
[1:17:02] said, Jesus teaches that same thing.
[1:17:05] But behold, the bridegroom cometh and go
[1:17:07] out to meet him. Now, I want you to
[1:17:08] watch what he's talking here. He's he in
[1:17:11] this message, he's bringing it down. He
[1:17:12] says, "Those sleeping virgins,"
[1:17:15] he's talking about the foolish virgin
[1:17:16] and the WISE VIRGINS. THE WISE VIRGINS,
[1:17:19] THEY'VE BEEN STANDING ON THAT ORIGINAL
[1:17:21] word
[1:17:22] and they've been standing there and
[1:17:23] they've been feeding on that word and
[1:17:25] feeding on that word and feeding on the
[1:17:27] word
[1:17:29] just eating it up.
[1:17:32] You say, "How do you know that?" Because
[1:17:33] they were full of oil.
[1:17:36] And he said the then then you got these
[1:17:38] sleeping versions. They come and they
[1:17:40] they rub their eyes.
[1:17:43] Can you imagine that? They're rubbing
[1:17:45] their eyes
[1:17:47] and here he's coming after them and they
[1:17:49] they're rubbing their eyes and trying to
[1:17:51] wake up from a slumber.
[1:17:55] And they said, "I suppose I should have
[1:17:57] some of that oil, too." You see, they've
[1:17:59] heard the trumpet sound
[1:18:02] in the last hour, in the last watch, AND
[1:18:06] THEY KNOW THAT THE BRIDE NOW they know
[1:18:08] the bridegroom's cometh. You see, people
[1:18:11] preach and they teach and they all over
[1:18:12] the world there's going to be a rapture.
[1:18:14] Jesus is coming back. Jesus is coming
[1:18:16] back. Come as you are. Alcoholic, drug
[1:18:19] addict, it doesn't matter. Just just
[1:18:21] come as you are. Wear what you want. Do
[1:18:23] what you want. Jesus is coming. They're
[1:18:26] rubbing their eyes.
[1:18:29] They're not seeing clearly.
[1:18:32] And so here now they're looking at they
[1:18:34] SAY, "MAYBE I SUPPOSE I should have some
[1:18:36] of this oil.
[1:18:38] MAYBE I MAYBE I SHOULD SEE ABOUT THIS
[1:18:41] Godhead deal that everybody's talking
[1:18:43] about around this message. MAY MAYBE
[1:18:45] MAYBE I SHOULD MAYBE I SHOULD LOOK INTO
[1:18:47] THIS WATER baptism thing. Maybe I should
[1:18:50] check this out a LITTLE BIT DEEPER.
[1:18:52] MAYBE I SHOULD MAYBE I SHOULD GET IN
[1:18:54] THERE AND and really see God and see
[1:18:56] that he is a healer and that he can
[1:18:58] deliver me from these habits that I
[1:18:59] have.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; You see, they're wanting it now. NOW
[1:19:02] THEY'RE WANTING GOD. NOW THEY'RE WANTING
[1:19:04] the true word because the hour is at
[1:19:07] hand.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Ber, I don't want to have to
[1:19:10] live like the any different tomorrow
[1:19:12] than I live today, knowing that the
[1:19:14] hours at hand. If Jesus comes tomorrow,
[1:19:16] I hope I can get up and my life I can
[1:19:18] live the same way as I live today.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW PREPARED I WANT TO BE.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be thinking all today I
[1:19:27] can get by with this or I can get by
[1:19:30] with that. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; EVERY CHOICE and every decision we make
[1:19:34] in our lives affects tomorrow.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; And they're sitting here, maybe maybe I
[1:19:41] should get some me some oil. But
[1:19:43] brothers and sisters, it's too late
[1:19:44] then. It's too late for them to go get
[1:19:47] the oil. The bridegroom has already been
[1:19:49] announced. He's already on the scene.
[1:19:52] Don't be that foolish.
[1:19:55] Get your oil now.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. have your vessels full.
[1:20:01] Now,
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; the real true bride is standing there
[1:20:06] and she says, "We got enough."
[1:20:11] Think about this. This real TRUE BRIDE,
[1:20:14] SHE'S STANDING THERE. SHE SAYS, "WE GOT
[1:20:15] ENOUGH FOR OURSELF.
[1:20:18] WE GOT ENOUGH OF the Holy Spirit."
[1:20:20] Brothers and sisters, THAT'S THE KIND OF
[1:20:21] LIFE I WANT TO LIVE. GOD, FILL ME UP
[1:20:23] WITH ENOUGH. MAKE SURE I'VE got enough.
[1:20:26] I don't want to come up short. give me
[1:20:28] enough. He says, she stands there and
[1:20:30] says, I've got enough to get in, but we
[1:20:33] can't give you nothing.
[1:20:43] And while that foolish virgin was gone,
[1:20:48] while that foolish virgin was gone, and
[1:20:50] now she's going to try to figure out how
[1:20:51] to get in.
[1:20:53] Now she's gone, she wants to try to
[1:20:55] figure out how to get some oil. and
[1:20:56] she's trying to figure this all out. And
[1:20:58] now while she's gone, the bridegroom
[1:21:00] comes and went in with the bride.
[1:21:08] And now the bridegroom looks at this
[1:21:11] this beautiful bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:15] and says, "My love,
[1:21:18] my darling, my sweetheart,
[1:21:21] come away.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Come away.
[1:21:25] Come away with me.
[1:21:28] You've lived virtuous. You've lived
[1:21:30] pure. You've tried to live a life
[1:21:33] without spot and wrinkle.
[1:21:37] You've longed for me. You've waited for
[1:21:40] me. You've been passionate about me.
[1:21:45] Your whole life. You've wanted me. Come
[1:21:50] away.
[1:21:52] What a great what a great feeling
[1:21:53] that'll be, brother Ber. What a great
[1:21:55] feeling that will be when he when he
[1:21:57] ascend when he descends and comes down
[1:21:58] and says come away.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Come away.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Come away.
[1:22:07] You see, he says it it isn't the way
[1:22:09] that we think.
[1:22:12] It isn't the way we think it will be. He
[1:22:15] says, "We we think that he's just going
[1:22:18] to hunt him out a few thousand people
[1:22:20] from this age and take them." He said,
[1:22:22] 'N no, it's the elected out of every
[1:22:27] age.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Out of every age.
[1:22:32] So, we've established a standard. And we
[1:22:34] look at the church age book and we begin
[1:22:35] to read and we see that in this church
[1:22:37] age book, the prophet tells us that the
[1:22:39] church is the standard that was set on
[1:22:41] the day of Pentecost. that that is the
[1:22:44] standard for the believer today. And
[1:22:45] there's no other pattern.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; If you try to cut the pattern,
[1:22:52] it won't fit.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; You know, I can remember my grandmother,
[1:22:55] she used to go to the to one of them
[1:22:57] fabric stores. I'll say it's Jo-Ann's.
[1:22:59] It's probably was Jo-Ann's. That's an
[1:23:01] old place. Jo-Ann's Fabric.
[1:23:04] And they had these patterns in there.
[1:23:07] And you you go back there and you open
[1:23:09] up a drawer. And I can remember them
[1:23:10] little packages was paper packages that
[1:23:12] had three little kids or three
[1:23:13] something, three little people on it. Am
[1:23:16] I right? Some of you seamstress know
[1:23:19] what I'm talking about. And you go
[1:23:21] through there and you begin to look and
[1:23:22] you try to find out a pattern that you
[1:23:24] want to fit. And you want to make your
[1:23:26] clothes to fit you off of that pattern.
[1:23:31] But you know what? If you take that
[1:23:33] pattern and you lay it out and you got a
[1:23:34] pattern that fits you
[1:23:37] and you begin to trim it and you don't
[1:23:38] stay on the lines,
[1:23:41] well, that pattern don't fit no more.
[1:23:45] Now you're having to draw it in.
[1:23:52] Some of you know what I'm talking about.
[1:23:56] BUT GOD HAS SET A PATTERN. GOD HAS SET A
[1:24:00] PATTERN THAT DOES NOT CHANGE. AND THE
[1:24:02] one who will follow that PATTERN IS THE
[1:24:04] WISE, THE BORNAGAIN, BLOODBOUGHT,
[1:24:07] virtuous bride OF JESUS CHRIST. FOLLOWS
[1:24:10] THE PATTERN that has been laid before
[1:24:12] her. She doesn't try to trim it.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; She doesn't think, "Oh, I think it would
[1:24:18] look better if I cut a little bit off
[1:24:20] here."
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; NO, SHE STICKS WITH THE PATTERN. AND no
[1:24:25] matter, he says, "No matter WHAT WHAT
[1:24:27] YOUR SCHOLARS SAY, THIS PATTERN HAS to
[1:24:30] stay the same."
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham had a vision
[1:24:34] and he was talking about in this vision
[1:24:36] that the bride of Jesus Christ was
[1:24:38] marching in there. And he said, "Oh,
[1:24:40] they were so beautiful, long-haired, no
[1:24:42] makeup, and they were marching in the
[1:24:44] vision." And he said, "But all of a
[1:24:45] sudden, I seen one of them get out of
[1:24:47] step." AND HE SAID, "I BEGIN TO HOLLER
[1:24:50] AT HIM."
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; You go look it up. That's what he said.
[1:24:53] I BEGIN TO HOLLER AT HIM. GET BACK IN
[1:24:55] LINE. GET BACK IN STEP.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; WHY WAS THAT? HE BECAUSE THEY WERE OFF
[1:25:03] THE PATTERN. HE SAID, BUT THEN AS THE
[1:25:05] VISION went on, he watched them and HE
[1:25:07] SAID THAT BRIDE, that virtuous bride was
[1:25:11] marching PERFECTLY IN LINE with the
[1:25:15] word.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE TOOK THE WORD, THE
[1:25:21] MESSAGE THAT WAS going around and he
[1:25:23] brought it to the to the people in this
[1:25:25] age.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; And so now they're marching perfectly in
[1:25:29] line with the word.
[1:25:33] So the pattern don't change. It doesn't
[1:25:35] matter what scholars say. It doesn't
[1:25:37] matter what your neighbor thinks.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the church down
[1:25:41] the road teaches. It doesn't matter what
[1:25:43] some minister preaches.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; If it's off the word,
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; it's off the pattern. Amen.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; If I preach something that's off the
[1:25:52] word, it's off the pattern.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; You see why we talk about a standard has
[1:25:58] to be trained. An ear that's trained.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; You should be able to recognize when a
[1:26:05] preacher preaches something off the
[1:26:07] word.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Your ear should be so tuned in. Yeah.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; If the prophet said that when every word
[1:26:14] of God goes forth, you can say and you
[1:26:16] can punctuate the word of God with an
[1:26:18] amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; What does that say when the word is
[1:26:23] misused?
[1:26:27] Oh me.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to to catch that.
[1:26:34] Listen what he says.
[1:26:37] The fact of the matter IS THIS. WHAT GOD
[1:26:40] DID AT PENTECOST, he has to keep going
[1:26:42] until the church age close.
[1:26:46] That's a direct quote.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Look it up. Here's you another one. As
[1:26:50] long as men are being called and sent
[1:26:52] forth with the word of life, there is an
[1:26:54] apostolic age going forth.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; So, the word has not stopped.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; The power has not stopped. The
[1:27:03] demonstration has not stopped.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; We just got to get in the word. We got
[1:27:08] to get in there. He says, "How is it
[1:27:10] done?" The true church is always going
[1:27:11] to be like the original Pentecost.
[1:27:13] They're going to try to be like the
[1:27:15] original Pentecost. He says, "Listen,"
[1:27:18] he says, "Having the same spirit of God
[1:27:20] in them, they will try to approximate
[1:27:22] the Apostle Paul.
[1:27:25] You have to work from the original." The
[1:27:28] true church will always be the one that
[1:27:30] tries to follow in the steps of her
[1:27:32] founders at Pentecost. and her
[1:27:34] messengers will follow the Apostle Paul,
[1:27:37] the first messenger of the first age.
[1:27:39] It's that simple and that's wonderful.
[1:27:43] So, let's look at this false bride for
[1:27:45] just a minute. Let's look at what he's
[1:27:47] talking about with this false bride. He
[1:27:49] says, "Because now, since you can
[1:27:51] understand how to judge the true church,
[1:27:53] what it was like, what she was at the
[1:27:55] day of Pentecost, and how it was in the
[1:27:57] book of Acts, we can apply the same
[1:28:00] rules to show us the church failed.
[1:28:05] You've heard the word test.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Give it the word test. Should I do this?
[1:28:11] Give it the word test.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Should I go to this this this event?
[1:28:17] Give it the word test.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Should I date this guy? Give it the word
[1:28:21] test. Should I marry this man? Give it
[1:28:24] the word test.
[1:28:26] Yeah, that's right.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; You know, we would save ourselves a
[1:28:30] whole lot of trouble in life
[1:28:33] if we would give things the word test.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Well, we could stop and preach here for
[1:28:46] a little while, but we got about 10
[1:28:47] minutes, 15 minutes left.
[1:28:50] These same rules apply that to show the
[1:28:53] errors that crept into the first church.
[1:28:56] The errors that crept in, they begin to
[1:28:58] take and they begin to pull out certain
[1:29:01] parts of the word.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; And then when when Arinius came on the
[1:29:05] scene, they took the word that was there
[1:29:07] and they said, "We don't like this." And
[1:29:10] they pulled that out. And then and then
[1:29:12] as Colomba comes on the scene, look at
[1:29:14] the darkness. As Columbus comes on the
[1:29:17] scene, as they took out more and more
[1:29:19] and more of the word, the world got
[1:29:21] darker and darker and darker.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Then Wesley, Luther and Wesley move on
[1:29:28] the scene. And then we have a revival.
[1:29:29] We have a reformation. We have something
[1:29:31] taking place. And then we see a little
[1:29:33] bit of light coming back in. But then in
[1:29:35] the last church age,
[1:29:39] they didn't want none of them Holy Ghost
[1:29:41] fililled Bible toten quote quoting
[1:29:44] people
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; and churches.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; They didn't want it.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; We want to DO OUR THING. WE WANT to do
[1:29:54] what we want to do. There was a move
[1:29:57] that went across the nation from the
[1:29:59] Isuza street
[1:30:01] into the message of the hour, the birth
[1:30:03] of the prophet of the hour.
[1:30:06] Think about everything that happened
[1:30:08] around that 1900s.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS TRYING TO MOVE IN A WAY GREATER
[1:30:14] THAN HE'S PROBABLY moved in any age.
[1:30:18] And here we stand
[1:30:21] rejecting God.
[1:30:27] Give it the word test. There's a true
[1:30:30] church. There's a false church.
[1:30:33] And that false vine will always try to
[1:30:35] usurp the position of the true church
[1:30:38] and contend that she,
[1:30:40] the false church, that she, not the
[1:30:43] elect, but she is the real authentic
[1:30:45] one.
[1:30:50] I hate to be critical.
[1:30:54] I hate to be critical because when I see
[1:30:57] people worshiping the Lord, I can't help
[1:31:00] but think that he appreciates the
[1:31:01] worship. But sometime is the worship
[1:31:04] heartfelt.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Stages are filled across the world right
[1:31:12] now.
[1:31:14] Hands up worshiping
[1:31:18] living any kind of life.
[1:31:25] and they say they got it.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; You don't have to do what that church
[1:31:30] down there on Taylor's Chapel Road does.
[1:31:34] We got it.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; That's what they say.
[1:31:44] 80,000 people
[1:31:46] singing gratitude.
[1:31:51] You know what I'm talking about.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; You saw it.
[1:31:55] 80,000 people
[1:31:59] singing gratitude.
[1:32:02] So I throw up my hands. Beautiful song.
[1:32:06] I love it. We've been practicing it.
[1:32:07] Sister Becky's going to sing it for you
[1:32:09] one day.
[1:32:17] BUT THE WORD IS THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING.
[1:32:21] But what do they have?
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; What do they have? An emotion, a
[1:32:28] feeling.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; I want more than an emotion. I want more
[1:32:32] than a feeling. I WANT A GOD IN POWER
[1:32:35] AND DEMONSTRATION and action and
[1:32:37] believer IN MY LIFE
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; WHEN I HAVE A NEED. I WANT A GOD THAT
[1:32:41] SHOWS UP on time.
[1:32:48] You see, a lot of times they put they
[1:32:50] put God off
[1:32:53] way off in the distance and they're
[1:32:56] constantly worshiping and praising and
[1:32:59] it's beautiful. I have to be careful in
[1:33:01] what I say because it's beautiful.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; It's harmonious. It's moving.
[1:33:10] But they got a God off in a in a such a
[1:33:13] distant heavenly place.
[1:33:16] I want a God that stands behind this
[1:33:18] pull pit. I want a God that sits at my
[1:33:21] dinner table.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; I want a God that that that that goes in
[1:33:25] the car when I go places.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; I WANT A GOD THAT GOES WITH MY CHILDREN
[1:33:29] ON THEIR JOB. I want a God that GOES
[1:33:31] WITH MY CHILDREN TO THEIR SCHOOLS. I
[1:33:34] WANT A GOD THAT GOES WITH ME WHEN I GO
[1:33:35] grocery shopping. I WANT A GOD THAT'S
[1:33:39] with me everywhere I go.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Not off in some distant land.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; We're going to find a place to close
[1:33:59] here. Acts 2:38.
[1:34:02] Peter said unto them, "Repent.
[1:34:05] Repent and me. Baptize every one of you
[1:34:06] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:34:08] remission of your sins, and you shall
[1:34:09] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[1:34:11] the promise is unto you, your children,
[1:34:13] and to all that are far off, as many as
[1:34:15] the Lord our God shall call. The
[1:34:18] promise, listen what he says. The
[1:34:20] promise of the power with which the
[1:34:23] apostles were endued at Pentecost is to
[1:34:26] you. Now listen, the Jews,
[1:34:30] read your church age book.
[1:34:33] The power that it was given to them on
[1:34:35] the day the apostles that were endued
[1:34:37] with on Pentecost is to you the Jews and
[1:34:41] to your children the Jews.
[1:34:44] Where does that leave us?
[1:34:47] Where does that leave us? Why has he
[1:34:49] LEFT US OUT? WHY HAS HE GIVEN ALL THE
[1:34:52] POWER TO THE JEWS? WHY HAS HE GIVEN IT
[1:34:53] ALL TO THE PEOPLE WHO who even despised
[1:34:55] him and rejected him?
[1:35:00] He didn't forget you.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; AND IT IS GIVEN TO ALL THAT ARE A FAR
[1:35:04] OFF, THE GENTILES.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; THAT'S US. THAT'S ME. THAT'S YOU. AND
[1:35:10] HE'S GIVEN IT TO US, TOO. AND AS MANY as
[1:35:13] the Lord OUR GOD SHALL CALL, BOTH JEW
[1:35:15] and Gentile.
[1:35:18] He didn't leave anybody out.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; He was THINKING ABOUT YOU. THIS POWER IS
[1:35:22] ENDUED UNTO you once you've been
[1:35:24] baptized and you receive the baptism of
[1:35:26] the Holy Ghost. It's a promise that's
[1:35:29] made to you. And he says in the church
[1:35:31] age book, the what the church had at
[1:35:33] Pentecost is her inalienable right.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Why do people try to rob us of our
[1:35:41] rights?
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Have you noticed that a lot of times
[1:35:44] people will try to rob you of your
[1:35:45] right? You you go and you tell somebody,
[1:35:47] "Well, I'm praying for somebody that's
[1:35:48] got cancer. I'm praying they're going to
[1:35:50] be healed." Wait, what's a doctor say?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:35:57] Well, I'M PRAYING FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S
[1:35:58] WHO'S BOUND BY DRUG ADDICTION AND THEY
[1:36:00] THEY they can't get over it and they're
[1:36:02] just fighting and battling a terrible
[1:36:04] drug addiction. Well, you know that
[1:36:06] stuff. You can't never get off of it.
[1:36:08] You know, heroin once you once you take
[1:36:10] it, you're addicted for life.
[1:36:18] But we've got inalienable rights.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Inalienable rights. Originally, she had
[1:36:24] the pure word of God. SHE HAD THE POWER
[1:36:26] OF THE SPIRIT manifested in diverse
[1:36:28] signs.
[1:36:30] What?
[1:36:32] There should be signs amongst us and
[1:36:36] wonders and gifts of the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:44] You mean there can be speaking in
[1:36:47] tongues and somebody can stand up and
[1:36:50] interpret it?
[1:36:52] You mean there can be wonders that
[1:36:54] happen? You mean if somebody were to
[1:36:56] fall dead, we could we could simply pray
[1:36:58] and they could raise up.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Now I got you thinking.
[1:37:04] Now I got you thinking.
[1:37:07] But these are the signs and the wonders
[1:37:08] and the gifts of the Holy Ghost. So, HOW
[1:37:11] MANY OF YOU'S GOT THE HOLY GHOST?
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; SO, SO LET ME ASK YOU, WHY SHOULDN'T WE
[1:37:16] BE LOOKING FOR SIGNS and miracles and
[1:37:18] wonders?
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we?
[1:37:26] What's hindering you from believing that
[1:37:28] signs, miracles, wonders, and gifts live
[1:37:31] amongst this group of people?
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Some of you is living testimonies.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:42] Let me ask you this.
[1:37:45] Are we looking for Jesus?
[1:37:48] Because you know the rapture is going to
[1:37:50] be one miraculous event.
[1:37:53] If you hadn't thought about it, think
[1:37:54] about it.
[1:37:56] There's going to be trumpet sound.
[1:38:00] There's going to be quaking.
[1:38:04] There's going to be an ascension or
[1:38:06] descension of a of Jesus Christ coming
[1:38:09] down to catch away a bride.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Now, if we're not looking for signs and
[1:38:14] wonders, miracles, and gifts, we
[1:38:16] probably shouldn't be looking for a
[1:38:17] rapture.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; But I'm looking for those things. I
[1:38:24] believe in those things.
[1:38:26] Let me tell you, WHEN MY SON THE other
[1:38:28] day was laying in the bed for two days
[1:38:29] with a busting HEADACHE ALL DOWN,
[1:38:32] EVERYTHING GOES through your mind. Jo, I
[1:38:34] said, "Jois, maybe you need to call
[1:38:35] somebody."
[1:38:37] Being in the medical field is not always
[1:38:39] good.
[1:38:40] Cuz the first thing goes through my
[1:38:42] mind, he's been in college, he's been in
[1:38:43] a dorm, he's got menitis.
[1:38:48] Two days he's laying with a headache,
[1:38:49] busting. He said, "I I can't even get
[1:38:51] out of bed. I throwing up. Such a such a
[1:38:54] hard headache.
[1:38:57] I didn't need a God that was off in some
[1:38:59] distance.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; When I went in there and I laid my hands
[1:39:02] on him in the bed and said, "Son, I'm
[1:39:03] going to pray for you that God will
[1:39:04] deliver you from these headaches."
[1:39:07] I needed a God that that could be felt.
[1:39:10] He needed a God that he could feel
[1:39:12] touching HIM AND SAY, "GOD IS MOVING ON
[1:39:14] THE SCENE."
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; It's not It's not some big me. It's not
[1:39:23] some big you. IT'S GOD.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD THAT WE'RE TRUSTING IN. IT'S
[1:39:28] GOD THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IT'S GOD IN
[1:39:30] THE MIRACLES. IT'S GOD IN THE HOLY
[1:39:32] GHOST. IT'S GOD IN the deliverance.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; We're just vessels.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; We're just vessels. We're filled with
[1:39:40] the Holy Ghost. So, we should be looking
[1:39:42] for the signs and the wonders. You say,
[1:39:43] "Well, you're getting way out of line,
[1:39:44] preacher."
[1:39:49] Let me ask you, what did Jesus do while
[1:39:51] he was here on earth?
[1:39:54] When I read my Bible, it says Jesus
[1:39:56] healed the sick. He raised the dead.
[1:39:58] Restored sight to the blind eyes. The
[1:39:59] lame walk, the dumb talk. He even did
[1:40:01] plastic surgery on a Roman soldier's
[1:40:03] ear.
[1:40:10] Can you imagine that day? They're coming
[1:40:12] to bind Jesus and Jesus is in the go and
[1:40:14] they're sitting there. They're fixing to
[1:40:16] take Jesus away and Peter pulls OUT HIS
[1:40:18] SWORD AND HACKS AWAY at this guy.
[1:40:22] ear.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Malchus, I think was his name. I think
[1:40:26] that's right. And he hacks his ear off.
[1:40:29] And Jesus says, "My goodness, Peter,
[1:40:31] what in the world are you doing? Come,
[1:40:33] come here, Malcus. Come here. Get stick
[1:40:37] that thing back on there."
[1:40:39] Can you imagine?
[1:40:42] Why did Why did Jesus have to do that?
[1:40:46] He had to have a message of restoration.
[1:40:48] CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
[1:40:50] to Peter if Peter would have had to go
[1:40:52] before the Roman council as a as
[1:40:55] SOMEBODY WHO TRIED TO murder a Roman
[1:40:57] soldier and who cut his ear off? They
[1:41:00] would have been immediate capital
[1:41:02] punishment for Peter. So Jesus says,
[1:41:05] "I'm in the restoration business. We can
[1:41:07] put this on and it's as though it never
[1:41:08] happened." Yeah,
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; we need Jesus in our life to look at us
[1:41:14] and say, "LET ME STICK THAT BACK ON
[1:41:16] BECAUSE IT'S AS THOUGH IT never
[1:41:18] happened."
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "You're talking about, oh,
[1:41:22] you're talking about ALL THESE
[1:41:23] MIRACLES." YEAH. THE WORD SAYS in Luke
[1:41:26] 24, "Behold, I send the promise of my
[1:41:28] father upon you. Go and tar in Jerusalem
[1:41:31] until you be endued with what? Power
[1:41:34] from on high."
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Power from on high. Acts two, Peter said
[1:41:40] unto them, repent. Listen what he says.
[1:41:42] Many other words did he testify and
[1:41:44] exhort, saying, save yourselves. They
[1:41:46] were glad and received his word and were
[1:41:48] baptized. And the same day were added
[1:41:49] unto them about 3,000. And they
[1:41:52] continued steadfastly in the apostles
[1:41:54] doctrine.
[1:41:56] They went straight back to the standard.
[1:41:59] And they they they steadfastly stayed in
[1:42:02] the apostles doctrine and fellowship and
[1:42:03] breaking bread. And fear came upon every
[1:42:06] soul. And many, let me say that again.
[1:42:10] And many wonders and signs were done by
[1:42:14] the apostles.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; You say, "That's
[1:42:25] the apostles."
[1:42:28] It's the same Holy Ghost.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; It's the same Holy Ghost. Well, that was
[1:42:34] Peter and that was James. That was John.
[1:42:36] That was Paul. That was Mark. That was
[1:42:37] Bartholomew. That was all THESE GUYS.
[1:42:39] IT'S THE same Holy Ghost. It's the same
[1:42:42] restorer of the word that come in and
[1:42:44] moved in on the scene. It was the same
[1:42:46] God that come in uh in in the days of
[1:42:49] Moses when they crossed the Red Sea. And
[1:42:51] Miriam picked up that tambourine and she
[1:42:54] began to praise God because of what God
[1:42:56] had done. Why? Because he had restored
[1:42:58] them out of bondage.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Signs, wonders, miracles. The bride in
[1:43:05] action.
[1:43:11] Peter and John, they leave the day of
[1:43:14] Pentecost.
[1:43:15] Wouldn't it have been neat to be there
[1:43:17] on that day? I I'm very thankful for the
[1:43:19] age we live in because man, what a
[1:43:22] reward when we make it to the other
[1:43:24] side.
[1:43:27] But Peter and John, they leave out of
[1:43:29] the house, out of the out of the the the
[1:43:31] the day of Pentecost in the upper room
[1:43:34] and they're going around there and
[1:43:35] they're walking out the temple and and
[1:43:36] they're going out there about the hour
[1:43:38] to pray and there's a certain man laying
[1:43:40] there laying from his mother's womb.
[1:43:43] Now, the whole city knows that this
[1:43:45] guy's been laying there for years after
[1:43:47] years after years. He's never taken one
[1:43:51] single step. And he's been laying there
[1:43:55] daily asking for arms.
[1:43:57] Asking for arms. Can you can you help
[1:43:59] me? Can you give me some money? Can you
[1:44:01] give me some some something to sustain
[1:44:03] me? And Peter and John look at him and
[1:44:04] they fasten their eyes on him. And it
[1:44:07] says they they look at him and and John
[1:44:09] says, "Look on us."
[1:44:13] Who were they looking at?
[1:44:16] They were looking at the Holy Ghost
[1:44:17] working through Peter and John. Look on
[1:44:21] us.
[1:44:22] And he said, PETER SAID, "SILVER AND
[1:44:24] GOLD HAVE I NONE, BUT SUCH AS I HAVE, I
[1:44:26] GIVETH THEE. AND IN the name of Jesus
[1:44:29] Christ, NOT IN THE NAME OF PETER, not in
[1:44:31] the name of John, not in the name of
[1:44:33] Brad, not in the name of Thomas, not in
[1:44:35] the name of John Ler, but in the name of
[1:44:38] Jesus Christ, look it up on us.
[1:44:44] In the name of Jesus Christ, pick up thy
[1:44:47] bed and walk.
[1:44:53] You say, "Well, what about Matthew 12
[1:44:59] 38?"
[1:45:01] You're talking about signs and wonders
[1:45:02] and miracles and God moving on the
[1:45:04] scene. What about Matthew 12:38 where it
[1:45:06] says, "Certain of the scribes and the
[1:45:08] Pharisees answer, saying, "Master, would
[1:45:10] we see a sign from thee?" And he
[1:45:12] answered them and said, "An evil and
[1:45:14] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[1:45:16] sign,
[1:45:18] and there shall no sign be given to it,
[1:45:20] but the sign of the prophet Jonas. For
[1:45:21] as Jonas was in three days and nights in
[1:45:23] the whale's belly, so shall the Son of
[1:45:25] man be three days and three nights in
[1:45:26] the heart of the earth." Oh, thank you,
[1:45:29] brother. The men of Nineveh shall rise
[1:45:31] in judgment with this generation and
[1:45:32] condemn it because they repented at the
[1:45:34] preaching of Jonas and and behold, a
[1:45:37] greater than Jonas is here. And then he
[1:45:40] goes ON TO SAY, "THE QUEEN OF THE SOUTH
[1:45:41] SHALL rise up in judgment. She she drove
[1:45:44] on a camel train for hundreds of miles,
[1:45:47] a years and years journey
[1:45:51] to go see Solomon." And he said, "She's
[1:45:54] going to rise up in the last day because
[1:45:57] she come from the uttermost parts of the
[1:45:58] world of the earth to hear the wisdom of
[1:46:00] Solomon. And behold, a greater than
[1:46:02] Solomon is here."
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:46:07] So who are these people that is seeking
[1:46:09] this evil uh this this this sign?
[1:46:14] It wasn't apostles.
[1:46:18] Stay with me here. Stay with me.
[1:46:22] The apostles through the name of Jesus
[1:46:25] Christ do signs, wonders, miracles,
[1:46:28] gifts.
[1:46:31] This wasn't the apostles asking Jesus,
[1:46:34] "Show us a sign."
[1:46:36] They were just merely living the life of
[1:46:38] Christ.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; But this was Pharisees
[1:46:44] and Sadducees.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; They were coming in there and they want
[1:46:48] to get in there and they're trying to to
[1:46:50] look at Jesus and they're looking at
[1:46:51] this and they say, "Show us a sign." And
[1:46:53] he looks at him and says, "An adulterous
[1:46:55] generation seeks a sign." You see, they
[1:46:59] ain't they're not the bride.
[1:47:01] You commit fornication on Jesus Christ.
[1:47:04] You commit adultery on him. You've got
[1:47:05] your own doctrines, your own ideas, your
[1:47:08] own way of thinking. You're living like
[1:47:10] a Pharisee, like a Sadducee.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; But the bride is living the life.
[1:47:19] Lord,
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; so the signs follow the believer.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; The believer don't beg for signs. We're
[1:47:27] not we're not out here saying, "God,
[1:47:28] show us this, show us that, show us
[1:47:30] this." But we're just simply living the
[1:47:32] word and letting the WORD MANIFEST.
[1:47:34] LISTEN, I'M NOT UP HERE SHOUTING to try
[1:47:36] to get the Holy Ghost. WE DON'T DANCE to
[1:47:39] try to get the Holy Ghost. We don't sing
[1:47:41] to try to get the Holy Ghost. We sing,
[1:47:44] SHOUT, AND DANCE BECAUSE we got the Holy
[1:47:47] Ghost.
[1:47:52] But an evil and adulterous generation is
[1:47:55] seeking a sign. Why? Because spiritual
[1:47:57] adultery had taken place. These
[1:47:59] Sadducees, these Pharisees, they were
[1:48:01] full of corruption.
[1:48:03] This was a test of Jesus. We're not
[1:48:06] testing Jesus.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; No, we're requesting.
[1:48:11] We have needs.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; We just petition our needs.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; And God delivers.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's what you want. Sometimes
[1:48:19] it's not what you want. But in all
[1:48:21] things give praise.
[1:48:33] Stand with me if you would.
[1:48:45] I know it's a little different tonight,
[1:48:48] but I trust that the word was was
[1:48:51] edifying for you that you was able to
[1:48:54] feed tonight and getting into the word
[1:48:57] and just makes me realize and and see
[1:49:00] that God is moving in this hour. And I
[1:49:03] believe it's I believe it's it's the
[1:49:05] preaching of the word that prepares the
[1:49:07] hearts of the believers. It's the
[1:49:08] preaching of the word that that that
[1:49:10] gives us encouragement. It's the
[1:49:11] preaching of the word that inspires us
[1:49:13] and and and and and helps us to push
[1:49:16] forward and gives us the encouragement
[1:49:17] we need to be who God called us to be.
[1:49:21] You know, it's easy to just be a a
[1:49:23] wallflower and just sit over there out
[1:49:24] of the way and and never expect God to
[1:49:26] do anything. That that's the easy road.
[1:49:30] But the road of a of a bornagain
[1:49:32] believing warrior is to fight for what
[1:49:35] for what God has given you. Those
[1:49:36] inalienable rights.
[1:49:40] prophet said already the visible
[1:49:41] manifestations of what I've been telling
[1:49:43] you are seen all around us.
[1:49:46] See he's preaching the word and as the
[1:49:48] preaching of the word goes forth he
[1:49:50] begins to see those those manifestations
[1:49:53] happening.
[1:49:56] There is a fact that the prophet for the
[1:49:57] last age must bring forth a message from
[1:49:59] God that will forrun the second coming
[1:50:01] of the Lord. For by his message with the
[1:50:03] hearts of the children be turned back to
[1:50:05] the Pentecostal fathers, and with the
[1:50:07] restoration of the word will come the
[1:50:12] restoration of the power.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; It's nothing we man nothing we
[1:50:21] manufacture.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; It's just simply going back to the
[1:50:25] blueprint and letting God move in our
[1:50:28] life. Let's bow our heads.
[1:50:32] Sister Becky, if you just play, how
[1:50:33] great is our God.
[1:50:37] [Music]
[1:50:43] Heavenly Father,
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:47] we're living in a late hour.
[1:50:52] An hour of deception all around.
[1:50:55] All a lot of deception in the name of
[1:50:58] Jesus. A lot of deception in the name of
[1:51:00] the church. a lot of deception in the
[1:51:01] name of Christianity.
[1:51:05] Counterfeit,
[1:51:06] [Music]
[1:51:08] you know, that that that counterfeit
[1:51:10] bill that the prophet talked about and
[1:51:12] preached about, they had to take that
[1:51:15] counterfeit bill and they they made it
[1:51:17] off an original,
[1:51:19] but there's something about that
[1:51:20] counterfeit. It's just not exactly
[1:51:23] right.
[1:51:26] Lord, I pray that we will stand on the
[1:51:30] original Pentecostal faith of our
[1:51:33] fathers,
[1:51:36] filled with the Holy Ghost, with God
[1:51:38] moving in our church, God moving in our
[1:51:41] lives and moving in our homes, that
[1:51:43] restoration will begin to continue to
[1:51:46] take place in our in our lives and in
[1:51:47] our children, in our homes.
[1:51:51] deliverance.
[1:51:53] As we've seen in the last weeks, we've
[1:51:55] seen we've seen young people be
[1:51:57] delivered from habits. We've seen young
[1:51:58] people delivered from lifestyles that
[1:52:01] were damning
[1:52:05] lifestyles that led to lead led to a
[1:52:07] early death and destruction.
[1:52:10] [Music]
[1:52:12] But we've seen deliverance.
[1:52:14] [Music]
[1:52:17] We don't we don't manufacture it. just
[1:52:19] manifest as we spread the word.
[1:52:23] We share the word. We share the life. We
[1:52:25] share we share what you're doing in our
[1:52:27] church and in our homes and in our
[1:52:29] lives. And and and upon sharing the word
[1:52:32] as as they say, go and preach the
[1:52:33] gospel. What is the gospel? It's the
[1:52:37] good news. It's the good things you do,
[1:52:40] Lord. It's the deliverance. It's the
[1:52:42] healing. It's the It's the freedom we
[1:52:44] find.
[1:52:49] So Lord, encourage us. Encourage us as
[1:52:52] we as we seek revelation, more
[1:52:55] revelation, more of you, more of your
[1:52:57] goodness, more of your power, more of
[1:52:59] your glory.
[1:53:02] Forgive us, Lord, where we fail you. We
[1:53:05] fall short so many times, Lord. And I
[1:53:08] just want to personally say, I'm sorry.
[1:53:11] I'm sorry for anything that I've ever
[1:53:13] done that was a hindrance of the
[1:53:15] movement of the spirit or a hindrance of
[1:53:17] somebody in their life. And so many
[1:53:19] times I find I I I would, as we say, put
[1:53:22] my foot in my mouth and I say things
[1:53:24] maybe that I shouldn't and I don't get
[1:53:26] checked before it's too late. So Lord,
[1:53:29] allow me, help me, Lord, in that aspect
[1:53:32] that I would only say and do what would
[1:53:35] be pleasing to you. I don't ever want to
[1:53:38] be a stumbling block.
[1:53:40] But Lord, may my life just be a stepping
[1:53:43] stone as they look and they say, "I want
[1:53:44] what he's got. I want what she's got. I
[1:53:47] want what that sister's got. I want what
[1:53:49] that young brother's got."
[1:53:53] And we only have that by staying with
[1:53:56] the original word.
[1:53:59] The word is our sword.
[1:54:02] Faith is our shield.
[1:54:06] That's where we find our salvation. Help
[1:54:08] us, Lord, in this hour. We commit our
[1:54:10] lives to you, Lord,
[1:54:13] more fervently today than yesterday.
[1:54:16] Deal with us, lead us, guide us, direct
[1:54:18] us,
[1:54:20] encamp us with your guardian angels,
[1:54:22] Lord.
[1:54:24] We love you, Lord, with all of our
[1:54:26] hearts in Jesus name. Amen. How great
[1:54:33] is our God.
[1:54:36] Sing with me. How great
[1:54:40] is our God and all will see how great
