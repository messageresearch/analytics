concerned I just want to thank everybody amen I'll tell you what I'm just amazed amen I don't know what was it that I thought about amen I just don't know how to express it really how much how proud I am of everybody amen amen and so if you want to have more meetings you want to do all of that like that we'll try to have some more amen amen I'm very proud of everybody amen and everybody working together amen and so praise the Lord when everybody works together like that it really makes a big difference and it's a difference between their success amen or not amen and so we do appreciate each and everyone's efforts and everything everybody did amen and I know that's everybody amen so praise the Lord God richly bless you amen it was wonderful wasn't it amen just have meetings like that and so amen but now it's back to the Grind well I don't know about that but anyway amen God is good isn't it I appreciate that last song David sang because it certainly goes along with what we want to speak on with the help of the Lord amen I'll tell you what I was just kind of re rethinking some of the things that the Lord's given me and amen kind of the Nuggets you know the brother bam talked about uh being a being a prospector you know and looking for those gold nuggets and I feel like that's what God's been giving us amen some good gold nuggets out of the word of God out of the message of the hour amen things like that nightmare we preached about isn't that right talking about the spirit amen and all those messages we got amen out of that one quote of brother bam talking about I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't a Christian amen amen and so what a wonderful amen thought and then tonight I've got another amen another message for you with the help of the Lord amen and um so we want to speak on God's Temple amen it started out amen kind of thinking about amen um Victory amen talking about the victory that a Believer has the Overcomer amen how that in every age it's to him that overcometh isn't that right and we've got things that we've got to overcome by the help of the Lord amen and then it went on from there on down so we'll see how the Lord will bring this out with his help amen so just pray for me amen I can't think of any announcements uh so I know we've got that Christmas play coming up this weekend so we're looking forward to that I'll try to have a short message amen Sunday morning and then we'll have the Christmas plate amen and so forth and the dinner afterwards thank you sister Joyce the Brad amen and putting all that together and everybody that's helping you amen so looking forward to that let's just bow our head and go talk to the Lord would that be our all right father we come before you Lord Jesus grateful to be your children father it is so exciting Lord it is so so I just no words can really describe father how thankful we are to know that we are your children God in the world that we're living Lord and and the world falling apart like it is and you're holding our lives together you're keeping us together emotionally spiritually in every way Lord because we've anchored in the Rock of Ages and we're so grateful for this Lord father we just ask God that you'll come again in a special way as we try to pull back the lids of the pages of your word God we would just ask God that the Holy Spirit would come and Quicken the word to us and say what you once said let Lord help me just to get completely out of the way that you might just use the gift that you've placed in my heart in my life Lord just to minister your word father and we ask God that you be with each one of the ears of the hearers Lord that they might hear what the spirit has to say to the church tonight God lord we just commit ourselves to you thanking you for your goodness in Jesus name amen and amen amen we'll just start amen and this is going to be um uh kind of a I guess kind of a Holiness message a Holiness message amen and so we'll turn our Bibles I think to First Corinthians the third chapter 1 Corinthians 3 I really wanted to talk about God's house God's house amen kind of talking about a local body amen God's house so to speak here a local body and then also you as an individual being God's house or God's Temple isn't that right amen and so in chapter three of First Corinthians we'll begin with uh verse 16 know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you and if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple are ye amen I'm going to move this down a little bit Don I I didn't have time David called me out and I was still writing stuff down so I didn't have time to switch out to my mother so I'm going to pull that down a little bit amen so God bless you this evening you can be seated amen which Temple are ye let no man deceive himself if any man among you seem us to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise let me just start out with the quote that come to my mind amen as I begin to let the Lord speak to me and amen and what I wanted to say this evening amen and it is uh uh um out of I believe it was uh out of a total Deliverance total deliverence ministered amen and it says now but says and the member of the church if he's called to be a member of a certain group he says then he would not compromise if the church believes that we should not gamble then that member should never touch a deck of cards if we don't believe in drinking then he should turn his head completely from drinking if if we do not believe in gambling or smoking then the member of this church should never touch such a thing God gives a complete deliverance amen so how many believes that uh you know that we are the temple of God the Holy Ghost the very Temple that God dwells in amen and God likes to have a clean house I don't know about you but most people I know like to have a decent and half clean house don't they amen and you just don't bring anything into that house you're careful about what you bring into that house amen and so he's saying here if you're a member of a church or whatever and you don't believe in gambling and cussing there's a whole lot of things that don't belong in God's [Applause] house amen what he uh some of the things he said that you're to get rid of and so forth and how that we're to mortify ourselves amen but this is the one that came to me because it began to tell me you know you know he mentions a few things but how many knows there's a lot of things amen God gives a complete deliverance and he will do it if we will completely surrender ourselves to him and you know I don't know about you but I believe that we're probably going to SP most of our days finding things in our lives to surrender to God that's right more I ran across a few quotes brother B's has you know that uh if he could get 12 people he was talking about book of Ephesians and he says you know if he could get 12 people like those Ephesian church if he could get 12 people completely surrendered into his hands he said he could shake the world he can do more with those 12 than he could with all the rest of the world it takes a complete surrenderance to almighty God Amen because the devil doesn't want you to completely surrender your flesh doesn't want you to completely surrender amen amen and if you are in the place that you should be with God Amen remember this is a daily battle the devil will try to come in there right amen and I think we spoke by I think last Wednesday talking about be careful amen because when things happen it's when spirits come in when bad things happen to you somebody says something about you you really you know and it was a brother or sister boy that really hurt if you aren't careful you let bitterness come in ain't that right bitterness and with that Spirit of bitterness comes in you know and it's a terrible thing and until that confession is made that spirit's going to be in there so you got to be careful amen watch out for things when they happen because they'll come in amen and it's the same thing kind of what we're speaking of tonight amen you got to be careful amen praise the Lord amen now listen so he says uh on he says if we will completely surrender and deliver ourselves into his hands and God can live in US Christ the hope of glory and he can reflect himself from us as we get ourselves out of the way amen then our thoughts are in thoughts how many believes that's what we coming to to where when you think in your own way you're thinking what he says what God thinks amen amen oh my could you imagine he says our thoughts are his can you imagine Christ sitting there smoking a cigar I remember a long time ago I watched some television program where a preacher was talking or whatever and and he was sitting there they were sitting around you know they were talking about the Bible and it was smoking huh wow no I don't think it do there's a lot of things you won't find Christ doing is that right if you won't find Christ doing it you shouldn't be doing it amen praise the Lord amen now notice all right can you imagine him smoking could you imagine Christ drinking or playing cards amen then if you your spirit is part of his Spirit he wants it to be upon your confession but some sometimes you permit the devil to come in and to take over amen and all the time in your heart weigh down you know that you're doing wrong when you do thing then he goes on and when one member would talk against another member you know that's not that you know that's wrong you're commanded to pray one for another not talk bad about one another right wow how be unity in the house of God God's house is not divided no there's no division in God's body amen now if you're not a part of that body huh let me tell you if you're filled with poison acid and Malice you're not in the body because the Holy Spirit doesn't have you know there's another thing about the house of God is there's not supposed to be any unforgiveness in the house of God no because my look how forgiving PO he says forgiving one another if you know if anybody done forgive them because if you have bitterness that becomes a poison acid in the church isn't it right so he goes to talking about one another how many believes you got to watch what you say one to another that's just one of the things amen praise the Lord that's right talk don't talk against one another love one another I'm some some one is down let's pick him up help him amen that's a unified group of Believers when we don't obey that then we don't obey God and we displease God therefore our church and our people cannot Prosper the church cannot go on because we're disunified amen praise the Lord if one member makes a mistake don't turn them down huh is that right help him up raise him up amen amen having he have a hearing one with another that's what the scripture says and when we make a mistake let's go before God before we can go before God then we got to go before the person that we've heard oh man he says I just had to do that and I know I did wrong I lied cost my wife to lie I mean believe lies amen don't belong in the house of God dishonesty don't belong in the house of [Music] God it don't BL Bel in House of God it don't belong in you amen it don't belong in you and it don't belong in the congregation amen this place is a special place amen let me just say something that I felt like the Lord poured in on me kind of maybe off the subject but a little bit but you know I wanted to say something to our young people and to our middle age and to our older but especially to the young amen and I I wanted to think you're lucky that's kind of the phrasee that we would use you're blessed the Biblical term is you're blessed you're lucky you're blessed amen do you realize in what family you could be born in Arab family mlim family and can you imagine your mom and dad discussing with you right now well do you really want to be a boy or do you think you're a girl yeah huh no such conversation here right there's no question we're blessed because you could search the whole world over young people and this is what you would find to be the correct way some of us parents have looked everywhere trying to find the right way haven't we we had to struggle we had to pray we were men andite we were Aries we were this that or the other but we come to real realiz hey the message of the hour is the right thing it's Jesus Christ made manifest you're blessed not lucky but blessed to think that you've got what it takes to overcome as a young person as a teenager you've got the thing that'll give you the very best life that there is upon the face of the Earth that goes for us middle AG that goes for us older it goes for every one of us we know when you realize you have found the way you have found the truth you have found the life and you possess it it ought to do something to us you don't have to be in the confusion that is out there in the world I am glad to have a clear mind because there's a lot of confused folks out there and it's getting worse dear falling apart that right but God's people is this message don't cause you to fall apart it don't cause you to Backside it causes you to get stronger it don't bring more sorrow to your heart it brings more joy to you it brings more happiness it brings Victory into your heart how many in the house of God it there ought to be victory in the house there ought to be overcoming in the house of God not to be lukewarm in the house of God no l go us in the house of God no cold form no icicles hang from the chandeliers it's ought to be a place that burns up when we come together bring the fire god it ought to be full of the fire god not the fth of the world amen amen praise the Lord not [Applause] halfway if God came to restore huh all that the Palmer wor of the caterpillar all the down through the age restore us back to the original Pentecost restore us back then there's got to be somebody that fulfills that might as well be me I don't know about you but I hope and believe it's going to be me there's only one in Al I feel bad for y'all this is one place you'd be okay if you call me said I feel f for you but I can understand that amen why because no it's GNA be me you better argue it's gonna be me it's me if we all feel that way we're all in good shape amen I'm glad for clarity don't you love a clear mind a clear word right I love it now if I've told you the truth if Jesus don't back it up you can call me a false prophet you can drive me out of town you ain't got to believe a word I say and then he would come he would do what he did show himself alive there's people think that our God ain't right because you know he had to he he felt bad about you know making man and so forth all kinds of reason not to believe God I've got every reason to you believe God go ahead and find every reason if you don't want to believe God you'll still stand before him you'll still confess that Jesus is Lord it ain't going to be allaha or Buddha or what all them guys that you stand before it'll be before Jesus that you stand amen is that all right that maybe maybe there ought to be a little noise in the house of God May ought to be a little Worship in the house of God there ought to be amens in the house of God there ought to be Hallelujah in the house of God cheating lying stealing on all of other that never be mentioned Among Us amen praise the Lord you love [Applause] him amen if you ever was going to be in brother B from one place he said man and if you're ever going to get in Now's the Time to get in he said that back then shouldn't we say that even more now you're going to be something you're going to be what you're supposed to be now is the time to be it not halfway isn't that right if you're a Christian God Don't Make Any halfway Christians God makes complete Christians God Don't Make Any halfway preachers but preachers can be halfway and God makes his children Christians but sometimes they're halfway it's because the it's not in God's intention for them that to be that way but it's their own ways get mixed up with the plan of God can I say it's an unsurrendered life there still some places in people people's life that's not surrendered I don't think I got to go to church tonight unsurrendered oh I don't think I got to have prayer this morning let me tell you one thing that's important in the house of God when we come to the house of God Amen is that you come early that you have prayer and that you get quiet before God amen did you make confessions before Aly God and not just here but it ought to be every day that's what belongs in God's house amen amen because getting down on your knees and making Fashions amen that's when you're sweeping you're cleaning the place up say God forgive me if I wrong and because of God and the temple of God is a holy place it's a clean place not a filthy dirty Place hey amen you love him praise the Lord amen praise the Lord God is good isn't he amen now you're all one great big sweet group praise the Lord amen is't that nice is it nice when the sweetness of the holy spirit is dwelling in your heart when you're driving down the road when you're working it's just the joy of the Lord amen you're a sweet person amen just like a group of people praise the Lord the Devils don't have any room to come in them double doors soon as they do they get called out before Wednesday night's service is maybe there'll be some devils they all go on leave if there's any evil spirits on any of us may they be gone before the end of the service amen sweet happy group of people he says but remember my warning Satan won't let you stay that way that's right amen he'll shoot everything at you he'll do everything to try to get you to get out of that hot fiery close walk with God wants to make you look he wants to bring something in to bring depression in right God no God don't want you depressed oh my but he does sometimes the devil don't he he'll make you depressed if you possibly can amen he'll oh knows or he'll shoot person listen if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target ain't that right amen and he'll cause a person to fellow ship under the quietness and S and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff amen now remember now you remember that the enemy will come but when he does you just cling that much closer together I mean know when the enemy comes you'll do one thing or another you'll either cast him out and block him out and stay with Christ stay with your pastor or your side with that little thing that bunch of poison what is that poison he says oh Lord you stay right together if a brother or you think somebody's a little wrong or a sister say Lord don't ever let me get a root of bitterness spring up cuz it'll affect him and it'll take Christ right out of my life how manyan know the second you allow somebody to get to you they got to you as long soon as you let somebody upset you you done been upset that's what the devil love to do s you on your head amen you're standing up happy and free now you're upside down and your smile is upside down you're UPS down you're happy and now you're all sad and blue the devil wants to upset you huh oh my why he says don't never let me get a root of bitterness to spring up because it'll affect him and it'll cre Christ right out in my life those poison assets of malice jealousy hatred bitterness hello I mean those are all poison acids with a like trink and strict n to your body it'll kill you that's what gossip and and oh this ain't right and that times the the person that's saying all this stuff is the one that ain't right you cause division in a body amen huh that's not of God no oh my amen listen that's right that's just that that'll take the Holy Spirit ride away from you it'll run him from the Tabernacle it'll kill the spirit of God and drive him away from here it don't belong bitterness hatred variance emulation wrath Strife unforgiveness all those things don't belong in the house of God they don't belong here why do you think we have people come out make confession got something wrong you got sin in your life come on up confess it make it right with God because you don't want to have that hanging around here you'll be a hindrance to the Church of God is that okay hey y'all asked for it brother Glenn said that I was going to preach good I didn't know that I was going or not but said brother you going to do good night I said if you say so got somebody praying for me I know y'all do too amen amen Revival isn't over just because a great preacher leaves Holy Ghost is still here evening my Tabernacle Christ is still here we got born to be excited about God and ever hopefully we got more fire than what we had when he came with everything that we made right all the confession we made we ought to be on fire more tonight than we was at the beginning of the [Applause] services but Glen I don't know how much gonna get I don't know how it's GNA get any better I like what brother Dar said Daryl said I think years and years ago is this legal can this be legal this feels so good is it legal that's right you don't feel that way how is it don't have it with me he says you know the Christian ought to be just as exuberant in the things that he does as the world doesn't his his we as they Delight in their stuff we ought to be just as much in delighting in the stuff of ours that's right they got a touchdown a he saved me what are you talking about he redeemed me Glory yes ex amen amen glory there ought to be a thrill in the house of God oh I love the thrill that I feel when I get around God's people what is it anden I've had a mighty battle but I'm enjoying the thrill of victory when there's Victory there's [Applause] is that's what belongs in the house of God Amen that's exactly right you love him amen so let's keep poisoning acids out of our body you wouldn't drink acids amen that'll kill that's the kind of stuff that kills a church Strife bickery backbiting gossip I know a church has got a lot of that problems someday I'll get to preach there amen we'll have the altar call because that's a is what I preach right here it's it'll kill you it's a bunch of mess if you can't control your mouth amen let the devil get in your mouth speak so you'd be better off being like the apostles they were quiet men until they get up in the Pulpit not to say a whole lot amen I thank God we don't have it amen praise the Lord how many believe we got to keep that stuff out ammen we got to keep those rattlesnakes out we don't care have rattlesnakes up in here no this is not a place where the devil is welcome Devil's not welcome here evil spirits are not welcome here spirits of Torment are not welcome here spirits of fear are not welcome here we've been ordered by all Mighty God that cast out devil not just out of this building but out of this house cast them [Laughter] out I give you permission to get as happy as I do that's right get as happy as I do to love this as much as I do it won't bother me amen amen if you get order don't worry calmly talk to you a little bit amen going to tell you brother B when you get out of order I don't know but I know you know if I want to jump I'll jump come on Amen how many believe we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth God help us to be able to rephrase that we don't want to say we ought to be the happiest people we want to be able to say we are we are the happiest people on the planet Jesus amen amen well I didn't expect to preach that hard but there it is is that all right just let go and let God have his way let him say what he wants to say praise the Lord I thought that was good didn't you because right after brother B talked about that you know if the church don't want to if the church don't stand for this then it ought to never be in there it ought to be gone not just that but everything else it's ungodly it don't belong in our bodies amen it's a nightmare when we come to together it's supposed to be in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus when the preacher got to come up here and chastise the church rebuke people call out evil spirits gets a little stressful hello that's right right but when everybody's lined up people's right in their hearts we can preach the gospel unadulterated amen pure no halfway I mean I don't want to be halfway it's not God's intentions for us to be a Halfway Christian but a lot of our lot of still a lot of our own ways still ways that we have that are not like Christ that are mix up in it I'll tell you now if you in the place where you ought to be as a Christian you'll be a Powerhouse for God that neighbor that you work with that Co coworker that you work with that boss that you work for they're G to be able to say that is a real Christian amen they should be able to say I don't know where you go to where do you go to church what church you go to huh they ought to be able to say cuz whatever you got is what I need whatever you got is what I want I what you got Lord folks if you ain't got that then you ain't got what it takes right that's called being causing people to be thirsty amen be salty so they'll be thirsty amen praise be to God Amen Hallelujah all right we're done with that one that's right drive him away hurt your pastor and all that other stuff wax that much closer to one buckle up the armor amen talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless youen whatsoever things are good good report just and all these other things amen that's what you want to do that's oh my this is this is what happens when you think on good things when you're out in your garage Lord what do you want me to preach Wednesday Lord help me to go think about good things think about good things the Holy Spirit thinks about good things and call out a lot of these other things amen praise the Lord all right let me uh let me go down give you a few scriptures of things that we need to get rid of is that okay all right go to if you want to turn with me first Corinthians look at what we need to get rid of he said kind of the same things to the Corinthians as he did to 1 Corinthians 6 verse nine know ye not that the unrighteousness the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither be fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor feminine nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous huh be careful that you don't aren't too greedy huh nor drunkards nor reelers nor extortioners shall have any inherit shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you amen come on folks that what we were we about everything in the book but not anymore but you are wasse you are Sanctified and you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the spirit of our God verse 13 Meats for the belly and belly for the meat but God shall both destroy it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the the Lord and the Lord for the body and God has both raised up the Lord and will also raise up by his own power know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ how many believes that you are the body of Christ you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of the Harlot God forbid what know you not that that which is joined to in Harlot is one body for two shall sayth he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit flee fornication every sin that a man committeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinth against his own body what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own for you are bought with a price therefore for glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods how many believe that the devil he likes to F to invade he likes to come into the temple of God and pollute the temple of God this is God's Temple when the Devil comes on you remember he has no rights to be in there that's God's Temple get out of here devil you ain't got no right in the temple of God Amen ain't that awesome over in Ephesians 4 Ephesians 4 rather lengthly reading so just bear with me Ephesians 4 and 17 this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but ye have not so learned Christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in in Jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put off put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness amen told you it was a Holiness gospel tonight how many know without Holiness no man shall see God Amen wherefore putting away lying speak e every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be a ye angry and sin not let not your the sun go down upon your wrath you've heard said if you get mad at somebody don't go to sleep till it's all taken care of huh is that right neither give place to the devil I mean knows the devil just wants to creep there he's a little creeper man he'll creep in any way you can don't you think it isn't the trial don't you think it isn't a Temptation don't you think it isn't a battle it is a battle amen not all easy right no it's not easy sometimes at all amen now notice let him that stole steal no more but let him rather labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may give and have have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying is that what said say good things about one another can't say something good don't say nothing right amen that that it may Minister Grace ears and grieve not the Holy Ghost holy spirit of God whereby you are shield until the day of redemption let all bitterness wrath anger clamor evil speaking be put away from you with all malice let's it up let's get rid of all of that stuff anything that's evil everything that's unlike God that's right put it away get it out get it out of your house get it out amen how many believe that but the B says

world kick it out the door say we're cleaning this place up around here sorry I mean that's what the Holy Ghost does me any garbage in your heart get it out of there that's right oh my K the television out I doubt any of you got television maybe not maybe you [Music] do but what do we got we got computers I got a great big monitor up there huh I got the internet brother Troy you can watch

many knows it can be used for good you can listen to preaches or you can go to hell watch the most things or you can watch preachers can be used for God but I'm telling you now a man if you don't you might not even have a computer but you got a iPhone there's your television now huh yeah yeah oh my that's right it's easier access to the bad stuff no out nowadays than it was with the television amen so you better get rid of that trash that's in here you better get rid of the desire for iten you better get so much of the Holy Ghost tell you don't want to do [Applause] wrong Lord oh my sometimes you got it fall sometimes you'll stumbl and fall but you get so tired of stumbling falling you say God deliver me from such oh my you say I I refuse to grieve the Holy Ghost I refuse to get rid of my joy I'm not going to trade my joy for something wrong let me believe that going to have to be strong cuz he's come in like a flood the only standard that God's got against it is his holy spirit his holy ghost take that desire away it gives you power over the enemy move out all the trash apply the token to your house not just your house not just this house but the this house anything

you ain't gonna fool God how many believes it's time to move out all the trash time to clean this Temple up and say God I want this place clean cuz I defile this Temple but God said he'll destroy me amen he'll destroy defile the temple of God and he'll destroy you you you'll perish with the wicked amen do you think so listen to this but fornication and all uncleanness and Covetous let it not once be named among you as become of saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor joking jesting which are not convenient inconvenient jokes but rather the giving of thanks and for this ye know that no hormonger no unclean person no Covetous man no idolator have any inheritance in the kingdom of God let nobody deceive You by vain bird that because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience amen be not ye therefore partakers with them amen amen don't partake of that evil stuff you are Gods you are the temple of God you commit fornication you do things you're trying to TI Christ in it he'll leave you in a heartbeat he's not going to have any part of that amen oh my praise the Lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them don't have no Fellowship how manyan those light and darkness don't have any Fellowship the fruits of this world and fruits of God don't have no Fellowship amen somebody that's called a brother that's doing these things you're supposed to separate from are you ready for it first Corinthians 5 and verse 7 Purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrif ice for us therefore let us keep the feast not with the old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the leavened bread of sincerity and truth I wrote unto you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators yet not all together with the fornicators of this world or with the Covetous or extortioners or idolators for then must ye needs go out of the world huh but now I have written unto you not to keep company of any man that is called brother be a fornicator Covetous an idolator or a huh always railing always talking about somebody right right amen or a drunkard or an extortioner with such a one no not to it you know a gossiper or somebody that's always talking about and rally ring on somebody hey brother you want to go out to eat nah that's okay I got Boney in my fridge I'll be happy with rather than going to eat with you huh with somebody like that that's not right don't go fellowship with them that's right with such a one no n to eat for what have I Jud to judge of them that are without do not ye judge them that are within put them that are but them that are without God judges therefore put away from among yourselves that Wicked person and he was talking about it was commonly reported that there's fornication among them such as not has been named man would take his own father's wife amen Corinthians had some issues isin that right he said man you got to put that person out you can't have fellowship with such how may believe we don't have any fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness amen praise the Lord amen I'm going pass on that that's pretty much all I want to read as far as that concerned amen how many knows Paul said that if any of these things is in the house in your house be careful go home and read again if you have if any of those things Covetous a a drunker a disab out the other huh feminine and everything else if you're that way you ain't got no inheritance in the kingdom of God I hope every homosexual and lesbian and all the eminent out there heard that don't think that you're going to join with God that bunch of mess no there's a big lake of fire waiting for ungodliness uncleanness filthiness amen many believe we need to be holy and pure before almighty God Amen now notice Satan hasn't got one legal rights on anything everything he's got is been defeated the only thing he is is a scarecrow now don't let now Satan can push things over on you and he'll just keep shoving you out and shoving you up is that what he tries to do he won't just leave you in peace no he tries one way he tries another way but he ain't got no legal rights does he that's right amen if I if I went to my house tomorrow night and I looked up there and there moved into my house was a great big bunch of people and they were all drunk and prostitutes and carrying on well I put them out well how are you going to do it they say well I'm human this house was made for humans oh the devil he always finds an excuse well others are doing it so you can do it huh he's just looking for a right to stay there is that right I don't care if Thomas berer is doing I don't care if Donnie Reagan's doing it I don't care if the most famous preacher if it's not right don't do it I don't care who it is amen oh my how are you doing it you say well I'm say this house is for humans I can live here too and I say no this belongs to me how many believe this belongs to God the devil ain't got no right on here bitterness hatred M all that oh my lukewarmness condemnation it ain't got no place in there wickedness it ain't got no place in there get on amen amen no he ain't got no rights this is my legal possession I've got an abstract grief here at the courthouse that shows this belongs to me didn't we just read he says you know you are not your own you are bought with a price God paid for you so when the devil jumps on you remember he ain't got no right to be there you've got a right to call the enforce or call the Holy Ghost down say you better get all out of here depression oh you might fail you might be down because sing and so forth but you got to say God I know that you're going to come you're going to forgive you're going to wash you're going to lift me up that Devil's got to G you be amazed how quick God is cast that devil out he wants to get us

wrong I'll make it right and I'll go on I will give the devil a black eye cuz when the weakest Christian gets on his knees and repentance the devil trembles he don't just tremble but he leaves aren't you glad for that there is an amazing amount of Grace in the house of God amazing amount of Grace you know how much grace brother brother Glenn if I do you wrong 490 times a day and I Jan L to come back and say but I'm so sorry you will forgive me that's how much grace is in the house I'm sorry but my mind is just a little bit too small to be able to comprehend somebody doing me wrong that many times in that 24-hour period maybe we'll divide it down and see how many times that would be a minute or whatever but they have to pretty much turn around and be doing it right away again would you there's so much grace I believe that no matter what a person does you just won't hold it against them there's just forgiveness there you know you'll pray for them amen how many believe that's the grace of God that's what he asks of us God is more willing to forgive us than what we're willing to be forgiven amen be honest with you sometimes we have a good time feeling sorry for ourselves Amen brother B I'm talking to myself if you ain't there sometimes I just Waller in my pity a little bit and I just kind of seem to enjoy it until I get sick of it I had enough now I'm done amen I amen that
