god bless you it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight thank you that'll be all for the musicians amen happy birthday i guess suggest amen and also let's just remember adriana i mean i know she's in the middle of that test so we just pray that y'all the lord will help her amen amen and so we also greet everybody on the internet amen i don't do that very much but amen we do want to appreciate everybody that does um uh tap in so to speak amen and stream to services amen that can't be here amen so god bless you good to be back in the house of the lord amen i can't think of any announcements so let's just bow our heads go before the lord in prayer kind heavenly father once again we are thankful lord to be assembled together lord in your precious name lord and knowing god that lord if you're in the midst lord jesus that's what will make all the difference and we sure appreciate you being here father thank you lord for the comfort that you have left us with lord jesus we think of the words that you spoke to your disciples before leaving how that you told and promised them that you would send them the comforter lord jesus and certainly you knew that in this world your children would need a comfort so tonight we want to thank you for that comfort of the holy spirit lord we can't tell you how much we appreciate it and what your holy spirit means to us lord just to be able to walk through this journey and through this valley lord with the presence your presence with us lord jesus and all the things that it does for us lord jesus we can't even begin to understand name it all but lord we appreciate it and we thank you father and we ask god tonight that you'll just take control of the service lord jesus help me just to step aside and lord let the gift of god operate tonight lord jesus and we just pray father that you'll speak to hearts tonight preach minister to lives lord jesus you know what we have need of you know every heart you know every thought you know every need because you're omnipresent and omniscient and father we just ask god that lord as you see our needs as you know our thoughts father we just ask god that you just look upon us lord jesus and be able to see that in our hearts we love you and want to serve you and and as your prophet has said in many of his messages that we come together so that we can learn how to be closer to you how to walk closer to you father we ask that you just help us do that tonight now in jesus christ's name bless the opening of the word amen and amen turn your bibles if you would we'll just turn to saint luke the 16th chapter saint luke 16 i think about a week ago this thought came to me and i just something uh in me wanted to preach on it uh but then last sunday i preached on something a little different but i would like to take tonight with the help of the lord and speak on on what the holy spirit i felt like influenced on my heart to speak perhaps it'll be something that we have need of i believe it is so in hebrew not hebrews in saint luke the 16th chapter and verse 16. the law and the prophets were until john and since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presses into it amen praise the lord may god his blessings to reading words you can be seated amen can anybody tell me tonight what sermon brother brandon preached after reading that scripture amen well it was desperation desperation amen so i want to speak on that with the help of the lord for a little while and we're talking about desperation amen brother branham he makes this statement he says you know he says now desperations he says usually it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation amen see it's too bad that it has to do that amen but human beings are so thoughtful in their mind that it takes an emergency something has to arise and when it does it throws them into that desperation amen then he goes to talking about really in doing that in desperation he brings out the real thing that you are and it shows what you're made out of in a time of desperation it usually pulls out all the good things that's in you amen praise the lord so he says you know let me just read this down here he was talking about israel and when they were fixing to leave egypt and the passover now brother bannon had preached on the token just before this okay the token and how vital that the token was uh token and then he preached desperation after that and he talked about israel how that they were in a desperate place a place of desperation amen so he says because see they had seen the great hand of god they'd saw all of his miracles and then they come under the sign of the token and while they were under the sign of the token they'd taken the communion in desperation that night was a very desperate hour because they all knew that judgment was going to strike that right the new judgment was going to strike and it throwed them into desperation they had seen all the miracles that got it done here god was fixing to bring judgment down upon the world and upon egypt and it caused them to have basically a way of escape and we all know the story of how they were to post uh blood on the little of the door and so forth and everything they were supposed to do and to take communion amen to eat the lamb and so forth and they were taking communion and and they were taking the community in desperation for they knew at the time that god was fixing to strike with judgment it was a shaking time amen a shaking time it was a time where every man was examining himself amen it was a time of examining himself because the word of god or of the prophet had not failed one time now put on your as brother bannon would say that spear your spiritual thinking cap because how many knows that everything the prophets have said to us has come to pass and they're right all the signs all the wonders and so forth amen and it's fixing to god's fixing to bring judgment upon the world let me just read a little further he says now notice because the word of the prophet had not failed one time it had been proven to be true whatever he said it happened just exactly the way that he said it amen the pillar of fire was still there and then the prophet had announced that god would only pass over when he saw the token at the door it was a desperation i want to take just one moment here talk about the the theme or the uh the core perhaps of the message that we want to speak on tonight the core of it is it has to do with the type of character that god is going to live with the type of character that is going to be in the bride of jesus christ there's other words and i'll go to the scriptures other words that i want to use as a substitute of perhaps uh desperation all right couple of other words that i want to use but it's around around a talking about the character that we're supposed to have all right so first of all let me establish with what the prophet said about this desperation and and and where it should be and how it should be with us so he says um all right so he says god would only pass over when he saw the token at the door it was a desperation now i believe that we're living in the days or otherwise the days that we're living in it should cause the church to go completely into desperation i believe since the message this morning from god not me i believe it ought to throw this entire congregation into desperation amen that we have played church long enough we've went to church long enough he says we've got to do something amen so this desperation the prophet of god talked about he says this aspiration is to cause every member everybody at the tabernacle amen to examine themselves and to look to see whether you're playing church whether you're playing with this about christianity and the welfare of your soul or if you're really serious about it or if you're not serious about it because what is the opposite of desperation well many words could use it uh describe it what did you say hon i heard somebody all right that's right that's a good word one word would be just lacks or you know mediocre or something just just lukewarm right just not desperate you know as i was thinking about this message i was thinking about desperation you know brother branham clearly making a statement that they'd ought to throw everybody into desperation it ought to cause people to become very serious about god and about their welfare and i thought about this as i was saying you know uh you know i really want to read this other first before i say this but i'm gonna go ahead and say it i don't know i've got the cat out of the bag but everybody sooner or later everybody is going to fulfill this everybody in time will become very desperate it will the whole world is going to get throwed into desperation [Music] a couple weeks ago we went through the scriptures and talked about the wrath of god when it's poured out how did they'll run amen and then hide themselves in the dens and the caves of the earth and say hide it's from him huh and then into another place he talks about you know there'll be millions of people that'll come to church to come to the altar they'll seek god they'll scream god help us god help us they'll get desperate about wanting god but they're not going to have it huh you're not going to get it because when the call came out for the world to become desperate and to get serious about and quit playing when that call went out they were just like the days ago and they're right but everybody will you will the whole world will get into desperation but the bride of jesus christ should stay in desperation in vigilance in other words for desperation to me would be vigilant [Music] how many believes we need to be vigilant every day i believe the blood of jesus christ should be vigilant okay and i'm going to go on to a couple of these other thoughts and uh but peter first peter the last chapter which is five it says be sober be sober and be vigilant all right because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may destroy amen so the bible tells us to be vigilant be desperate another another message brother bannon preached a lot i believe was perseverant and that right perseverance pressing into it pushing on trying a little huh because somebody knows if you're sitting here tonight you can probably amen the fact that we have a real strong tendency to relax become slothful and hey before you long you're sleeping some people the only preacher can be running up down the aisle some people sleep huh that's not vigilant right not desperation but we as human beings brother bam says he's you know we in our minds we tend to become that way amen we tend to lean towards being slothful in our mind amen we tend the whole world is that way very much very much now you're very slothful you're not desperate they're not vigilant they're not uh perseverant but like i said this has to do with the character that jesus is looking to have lived with and brother branham used this scripture that the bible talks about that even to enter into the kingdom of heaven it says that they have to press now i preach a lot about just having faith and just accepting it and believing it right i believe there is that side but there's another side i did god wants to know whether you're serious or not i mean god wants to know he likes to test you he wants to see how serious you really are you might think i've got the faith i got the faith to believe and god don't answer and boy i thought that i had faith to do this you know and you get taken back man maybe i didn't you know i guess that's nothing to that i'll just go off somewhere else do something else huh god knew he'd be that way before he ever give it to you probably why he didn't give it to you comes to mind y'all remember buddy robinson right his story man he wanted to get saved he want the holy ghost so bad huh he kept trying he was satisfied but he just never could overcome that problem that he had of biting the mule's ear and temper and everything else isn't that right and he you know hit him over the head and then apologized and he got desperate he got serious about it and got down and he got to between life and death it had to be that way and then god says that's how i wanted you son i wanted you to i wanted to know that you mean it amen press into it you got to press into it amen so we look at this all right so we've played you got to see if you're playing how many this is the time this is the time because we don't know how long we're going to have a church open we don't know how we don't have it wouldn't it wouldn't be something where they fixed the clothes at church and now oh i'm gonna i want i want to get my life right i want to get my why don't you wait so long we had all these times yet this wednesday night yet in between services you had sunday you had all this time to get ready now when the pressure comes you all of a sudden wanted to do this no that's not time to get desperate that's not time and listen from what i'm gathering here you judge you be the judge tonight but from what i'm gathering what from my blood the prophet of god says that he says that the believer ought to be in that state of desperation without the emergency in other words clear-minded you need to be serious-minded and serious minded as if the situation was right there already how many agrees that if you would actually be that desperate about things you'd get a whole lot further you'd be a lot better off if you would just have that desperation without the emergency you'd be a whole lot happier person this church would be in a whole lot better condition if we would all be in that state all the time without the death without the problem without the emergency amen i think that's why i laid on my heart because i felt like i was just like floating along like slothful or just like you know and i'm like you know i don't think it's supposed to be like this you know the lord victor says you know remember what i told you about desperation you know i told you to be desperate without the emergency if man could just be this way all right so he says now how is it that we can see other great signs and wonders done by others and what about us he says it should cause an estate of desperation that we are determined before god that the signs of his coming should bring this entire congregation amen when we read it from the word and the holy spirit has told us that all these things would happen so forth brother brandon was talking about the cloud coming down when i got it said everything that was gonna happen it all happened i mean he believes that when god says something in this message it has happened and it will happen and it ought to make us desperate we see it unfolding we see the world truly falling apart like he said it was back in 1965 and we began to see that falling apart it ought to make us examine ourselves to see god am i where i should be right now or am i slow is my prayer life down [Music] oh my that's right again this was in paragraph 52 here's paragraph 61. desperations desperation signs of his coming should throw every member of christ into desperation now about our souls about our welfare for hereafter listen everybody the signs of his coming should throw every member of christ into desperation now about our souls our welfare for here after i like that that's why i said it twice if you noticed the welfare your welfare for the hereafter hey man because i'll tell you right now our bodies our minds everything around us it is about our existence here not necessarily about our existence in the hereafter where are you gonna be when the rapture comes what condition are you in now are you ready for the rapture or not if the law would come from the clouds from the skies and appear to those that are raising already amen would you be ready to go it's either yes or no right now right now you have to ask yourself is are you playing church are you are you really desperate about it because if you're not ready then you haven't been desperate like you should amen and that's this message is definitely for you you need to get desperate about your soul and about your hereafter because we know we don't have long to say it doesn't matter if another republican if trump's there another four years if the democrat doesn't made a bit of difference it doesn't make a bit of difference that's just a small thing being worried about that worried about the big thing and that is leaving this place because it's going to go down one way or the other it's going down she's going to sink amen all right so establishing once again talking about the desperations and the condition i believe the prophet of god said that the church ought to be in now i think of brother branham of whether he was desperate or not how blessed was brother branham how perseverant was brother branham huh preached perseverance amen he talked about amen being up and doing and amen and not being thoughtful and he he i believe in his life truly demonstrated desperation because you can listen to his messages all the way to 65 and he only got hotter for the lord he wanted more people saved trying to get people to christ is that right all the way sacrificed his life with his family and his children to try to get people into the kingdom of god he lived a life of desperation it's time don't wait am i right he did i believe that ought to rub off on the bride that all of our life we are in desperation in a state of desperation in its state of vigilance in a state of perseverance sincerity amen it'll make all the difference in the world all right so the welfare of our selves hereafter he says well right after that what are we going to going to amount to if we gain the whole world but if we lose our soul huh you think about our most of our senators and a lot of these people that are worth 100 million dollars and 200 million dollars and billionaires and all of that stuff you think well what is good is that going to do when it all falls apart not one bit it's only going to come down to one thing in it that is your soul what condition is your soul in you might gain the whole world but what good is that going to do you if you lose your soul amen brother baby says what are we living for what do you work for what does anybody make why do we work well we work so we can eat he says what are you eating for next question what are you eating for what are you struggling for is to live amen how many knows if you found out you had cancer there wasn't hard to be any other concern you would have other than trying to beat that cancer and live that would be your main concern you wouldn't be worried about your bank of cops your neighbors and what everybody else is doing in church wrong or right or whatever huh that's obvious everything else becomes second whole world becomes secondary you want to live what doctor can i find what medicine is there can they cut this thing out of me will i get healed with the lord can i get all touch him can i touch the hem of his garment all those questions would become relevant because you want to do what live hey how many is happy to be live are you glad to be alive ah that's pretty good i guess i don't know about you but i'm ecstatic about being alive i love it i'm glad to be alive that's what i'm struggling for that's what i'm working for huh to live amen and not just the natural life but that's what i'm struggling spiritually for i mean that's why i read my bible that's why i pray that's why i have a compelling with god so that i can live spiritually that's why i love desperation to talk and leadership amen to live and then are you ready for the other part i know some of y'all can answer this what are you living for what are you living for what's the answer according to brother branham what are you living for brother bam says nobody knew huh huh to die very good sister becky to die that's the exact words to die kind of a twist didn't expect that did you all right now notice what he says here you're living and you're living to die because that's what's going to happen if you stay in this world keep drawing breath eventually you're gonna die that's what you're living for is to die all right maybe somebody else has the next phrase in this is a well known by that scripture a quote all right let me see how i can phrase this well i don't know how to phrase this so i'll just read it to you is that right and you're not fit to live is right you're not fit to live until you're fit to die that's what he says you're not fit to live until you're fit to die what's he saying you're not fit to live your life unless you're right with god because you're not ready to die or fit to die unless you're right with god so he sums this whole thing up talking about what's it all about folks it's about being ready to die if you do and meet the lord because how many knows i believe brother bram talked about being burned up in a fire in a car tortured drove through with whatever he says but there's nothing as horrible as a man going out of this world without knowing christ nothing as horrible as somebody dying without god amen so he says last phrase it's true it's true amen now we come to the part where brother brahm tells us why we are not in desperation why people are so lacks thoughtful lacks a basical why i believe that the reason that we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love the love of god i think that the love of god causes desperation amen if god is in you to token inside of you and you see the conditions of times and people waiting in sin the way that they are it'll throw you into desperation i can't help but believe that part of the reason that i've come to this is because i felt lacks i felt like i'm just a little lacks on the lord there should be a little more exuberance there'd be something more about me you know i did something that i hadn't done and i want to do it a bunch more but the other day upstairs after uh getting up i turned my speaker there by my computer and that i listened to brother branham the music or whatever i took my big speaker and i turned it over to the window opened the window a little bit it was kind of cold out but i was going to go out in the garage and work and i turned it out there and i put it out to the outside so i could hear it and i turned it on real loud and i think i started with psalms somewhere early in the psalms and i cranked up the bible and i played that for the biggest part of the day i was hearing the bible read huh i thought about the times that israel would go out and remember they would have bible reading and the priests would read the scrolls and so forth for about a half a day you all remember that they'd read all of it and they'd say the glory of god would come down huh and my how many times did people go to acting up when the glory of god comes down hello that's right but you know it was the presence of the word and then the god of the word coming down and doing something and boy they had a jubilee until it says that they couldn't even read it anymore because of the people's noise amen how many knows the holy ghost brings life wherever jesus is there's always a lot of noise it can be quiet but there's always noise wherever jesus there's life but you know i did that for the most part of the day and i went through there and i'd pick up things here and pick up things there in ecclesiastes songs of solomon you know and we went through quite a few different books in that day's time but i thought that is awesome to have my farm ringing with the word of god i hope the neighbors heard it huh sometimes we gotta listen to their boom boom let them listen to the word of god a little bit i don't the cop coming back there and say hey you gotta turn your preaching down that's better than your rock and roll right but anyway why because i like to hear the word of god but you know it's just feeding me and i was like lord help me and this thought came to me lord help me because as i was reading here it talks about brother brown says that the reason people are not desperate they couldn't give a hoot what everybody's condition is let's admit it that's the world we're living in we really don't care what anybody's condition is you know why because you really don't care what your condition is huh because how many knows this to be true that when you can when you care about what condition you're in huh because that's what the love of god does when the love of god comes on me it tells me hey you know you're not quite in the condition that you ought to be in i had to have more desperation how to have more fervor it doesn't matter how smooth things are rolling it doesn't matter how nice things are going you should still be in a desperation you should still be vigilant huh how many believes that that's what brother ben was trying to tell us here don't let just that state of emergency put you in that it's too bad that it takes emergencies to get us to a place where we can actually get ahold of god or whatever it might be or be the kind of people that we ought to be and then in the conclusion of this thought is that if you care about yourself you'll get yourself in the right place and the love of god will constrain you to pray for others that need it also it makes you care for other people how many believe that that's what the love of god does it makes you desperate when you see somebody not in the state that they ought to be slipping from god they're backsliding huh the church getting too quiet everybody just too lack hey you get concerned you're like god help us there hey man it's too easy to just be let it be secondary let god be secondary huh don't make me get mean here but that's almost sometimes for us that's a good compliment that's good to have god second huh because a lot of times we put him fourth and fifth and sixth huh no it's not good to have him second but sometimes we got him five somewhere out there you know i i'll be i'll be a christian i'll do this you know you know put god on the back burner he ain't even their second anymore if we aren't careful hello not saying anybody is but i'm just saying we as human beings everybody here would completely understand that it's easy to let the devil get that on us where god becomes third or fourth not even second or let alone first it's easy for it to happen folks amen all right so i didn't want to get too mean but sometimes that about the truth isn't it so it's the love of god i think i thought about what even faith how many notes now let me just read a little more here we'll go a little further so it's here now a lack of love okay he says it'll throw you into desperation i believe it will now the word plainly states in galatians 5 that faith works by love amen one place brother brown said if a guy if a boy really loves a girl and she lives somewhere way off somewhere huh if he really loves her it might be cold it might be whatever but he's going to find a way to go see her isn't that right he'll find a way you know mom and dad say look you ain't got no money you can't do this out of the other hand you'll go get a job for a little while you'll save that money you'll get your airplane ticket and you'll fly there why because it gives you faith that i believe i can don't tell me i can't i'm gonna do it huh love brings faith faith brings desperation amen how many believes that faith gives you strength how many believes that it gives it doesn't make you lackadaisical it gives you strength faith does didn't motherboard say that faith had what on its chest was it hair or muscle hair right i was debating that i said was it hair or was it muscle i'm not sure you know what hair has got to do with it but he said hair so all right another word strength right faith makes the sword it has strength in it praise god how many believes that oh my genuine faith brings desperation love brings faith faith brings strength faith also brings perseverance amen inspiration like the woman with the blood issue is that right she was desperate for her healing and she didn't care how she had to get to him and how many people she had to wallow through and push aside hello get down there and just get through the crowd she was desperate remember this prophet makes a statement i may read it yet he says a desperate soul can always touch the heart of god isn't that something that even jesus talked about that widow or that widow woman i believe it was that went to the judge and said man i want some vengeance for this i want some recompense but he wouldn't listen i don't forget a man but because this woman continuously bombards me i'm gonna give her what she wants isn't it something that even jesus used that illustration if you want something from god amen you better be desperate for it he wants to know that you wondered about everything amen brother baptist he says not he that knocks no he said he didn't knock us hello hello knock it keep knocking amen somebody can open the door that's where it is with god he could open the door but you got to get desperate say well i'm just not desperate then get the love of god in your heart it'll bring faith in god it'll help you conquer every enemy that you've got it'll bring the goliath down it'll stop the mouse of lions but you gotta have the love of god in your heart without that well well another day huh amen man told me something the other day but i'm gonna hold off because i'm on the internet and this is one time i'm actually going to hold off i don't usually do that brother right but i don't offend anybody but listen how many believes we need desperation we need the love of god that makes us do things i was driving down the road today and while i was driving down the road that desperation hit me again because i was praying what do you want me to do and our lord brother thought hey about a week ago he thought about that and he began to pour things out and little elena she was with us and she says papa what are you going to preach on or do you have your message right remember that do you have your message you can play with us now right you got your message do you got your message she was looking for that you know i said yeah she says oh you did when did you get it i said about five miles back [Laughter] oh really what is it it's desperation and faith and as we were driving down the road i began to think about faith and how did it brings that desperation it brings perseverance is another word perseverance desperation vigilance that right now i wrote down i said honey write this down it's coming right now she began to write it down first thing is faith gives you desperation first of all love brings faith faith gives desperation faith makes you strong amen hair on the chest it gives strength it gives diligence it gives vigilance perseverance desperation amen it gives you perseverance and it makes you great how many believes it makes you brave my nobody would have dared challenge goliath and when little roddy david come in there isn't that right little brother fella put on and then he went up there and he told saul hey you know god delivered uh bear to me he delivered a lion to me he'll he'll deliver this uncircumcised philosophy huh faith takes your complexes away young people you got complexes inferior complexes get faith get the love of god in your heart it'll help with a lot of those things why because you know who you are you're nobody to begin with but he's everything isn't that right david didn't have no inferior for complex just because he was short and little but he went in there and he says you know they sat in the other and saul says really you have that kind of testimony that really happened god really did well maybe god did send you here all right guards take him back to my shield room dress him up give me my spirit give me my shield give my sword and they went back there and they dressed him up right he come back out everything was too big two sizes too big jingling and tangling and jingling and jangling and couldn't barely go can you imagine the sight to behold he's going to kill that big guy he can't even walk with what he's got on now right let's brother branham put it he says get all of this off of me i i've been proven this you know i don't know that this works hallelujah how many knows that if you don't know that it works you probably won't try it i'll tell you what if you don't know what it's like to trust god in tribulation then you probably haven't had it happen to you but if you have trusted god and he's taking you through this and he's taking you through that it gives you the faith to know that he's gonna take you through the next wall he's going to take you through the next seat he's going to help you conquer your next problem and you learn to put your trust in the lord makes you vigilant be vigilant for your adversary the devil is vigilant he's your adversary he goes about seeking whom he may devour wrote a few other things down makes you brave amen perseverance or long suffering it won't be real long real short anymore you'll have love long suffering huh you can't wear that guy out huh long suffering it makes you strength is long suffering all right but then let's talk about the other while it puts hair on your chest it makes a man out of you it makes a lady out of you isn't that right it makes you all day do you nice like a girl is supposed to be not aw my man you know give me a hat and a cap and a pair of britches no don't make you do that makes you a lady and what does it do for the men what does it make a man anybody can tell me a gentleman how many believes it makes you a gentleman all right while you're strong while you're taking down giants but yet you're a gentle man at the same time gentle it makes you kind wow big burly strap on guy just kind this can be am right that's what the holy ghost does how many knows it makes you understanding that's what it does it makes you what do else what else do what do else it makes you put yourself in other people's shoes didn't brother branham he had so much love of god in his heart he wanted to give that mexican history see if his coat would fit him you know you're trying to help and pray for him you can't love people don't want to help people hell you won't never be able to do anything unless you beloved people and put themselves in shoes and let me tell you if you got the holy ghost somebody has said something this side or the other you try to see where they come from and what they're saying hello how many knows we don't have a whole lot of that going on in the world people don't try to understand what each others are saying no but the holy ghost makes you try to understand what oh so you're saying this most of the time if we are talking to somebody i disagree but no no it's like this you're way wrong you know that's not holy ghost holy ghost gives you understanding and another thing it does it makes you meek and that right meek kind the bible says be kindly affectionate one to another how many beliefs we need kind affections kind affections one two another let me tell you this again i truly believe we need it i need it we all need this more than what we have and that is to be kindly affectionate one to another amen and i always like this because well don't just put it on no give more of the love of god and that's what it'll do for you make you considerate of other people love other people amen praise the lord so he says the only way that you can have faith is to have love first because after all faith is love's incentive incentive he says that's exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love comes off of it like a spin-off if you don't have love you can't have faith amen another one last quote here brother brahm says this way on this one anyway we know that it is true that god will meet a desperate soul how many knows he did jacob jacob was a desperate soul i've got to read this other one yet here it's it's a when i heard it i i had to print it out because i listened to desperation this afternoon i heard something and it's it's a profound statement he'll meet a desperate soul now we all know that but it usually takes something to drive us into that despair to desperation it takes something to do it he says jacob now no jacob in desperation said you know he says i may have filled you you're here with me but i'm not going to let you go somebody see sees it fine just a little sensation they get up and jump them down up and down run the hall and say well i got it i got no not jacob jacob stayed there until something happened many know jacob got into desperation because esau was coming to meet him with 400 armed men because of how he had swindled him he wasn't too happy with him and jacob was scared to death when god met jacob on the backside of the desert amen he knew he had him and it says that he wrestled with the angel of the lord i believe that's god's angel the angel of god wrestled with god hello all night long did he talk about a long wrestling match he wouldn't let him go i don't know i had hold of him but he had a hold of him he wouldn't let him go remember in the morning the bible says he said let me go i gotta go it's morning no i let you go god loves again he loves people of this nature and of this character amen jacob stayed there until something happened that made him walk different how many believes that could happen made him a different person because that he stayed until it happened the bible said it said that he held until he prevailed huh until he prevailed until that something happened the bible said now listen how can how can a man prevail over god but you can do it did you hear me say that that's what he said but you can do it again he says you can do it a man can prevail over god profound what that's what he said jacob did he wouldn't let him go how about the woman that had a problem i think it was her daughter and she came up to jesus and she wanted healing and he wouldn't even answer it wouldn't even answer they kept going and he said what are you going to do with this woman tell her to leave us or whatever and he says it's not meat to give the children spread to dogs huh tried to completely discourage her but a man said he called her a no most people would say he just caught i know it was around the clock i know it was in the in a what do you call them i don't forget just what it's called but in another way of telling you that you're a dog not not me to give the children's bed to gentiles or gentile dogs because she's a gentile and the woman prevailed and she had faith she had desperate she wouldn't let go what did she say she says yes lord she acknowledged you're right that's right you don't reach over and get the children's brand say here's susie give me your piece of bread i'm to give it to the dogs can you man little susie over there going to cry you're right lord it's not good to give him but guess what little susie hey man she had all but a little bit and she kind of dropped a big piece and it fell down on the floor now you can do the three minute or three second thing you know or a little puppy there under the table amen is going to snatch it up hey that's where i always justify a house dog sorry biblical it's under the table where's your table i guess you know here we go we gotta get off that right all right but listen he said it's you're right but she actually told him something isn't that right she told him yeah but they do eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table what did he say woman woman great is your faith be it unto you according to your faith how many beliefs that's truly how it is it'll be unto you according to your faith amen god bless you let's stand tonight power heads how many people would say that that message resonated in my life in my heart i heard that that was for me tonight that was for me god bless your hands now lord jesus we want to thank you father for we know
