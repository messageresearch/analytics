so great foreign good so hey um foreign [Music] so foreign come on okay good morning brothers and sisters if you'll just stand this morning it sure is a privilege to be in the house of the lord this morning if uh brother joe would just open this up in prayer this morning oh [Music] my um it doesn't matter foreign [Music] today [Music] amen we'll just go in the psalms and then sunday schools the children can be dismissed for sunday school and we'll go to psalms 91. psalms 91 he that dwelleth i can wait just a little bit here he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome of pestilence thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by day thousands shall fall out thy side and ten thousand at thy right side but it shall not come nigh thee because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways i shall tread upon the lion and add her the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation god bless you maybe seated brother brian for adult sunday school morning brothers and sisters you know after a chapter like that what are your worries well there's really nothing for you to now don't get me wrong you know the life can be difficult but after reading a chapter like that and if your confidence is in the word of god and in that relationship you have in it then what are your worries this morning and it's going to be your enemy's goal to get your mind clouded and your eyes clouded worrying about things that you have no control over that you should be releasing to the lord and not worrying about that's his sole purpose is to just ruin your life to get you worrying running after things that really don't matter in the end if you were talking with me to the 15th chapter of the gospel of john i was trying to use some technology this morning and it didn't work out for me so i'll have to do this for memory this morning i was uh researching certain things but i i was thinking this morning where we're sitting at if you look over on this picture right here and i have a loud notice that there's no light there it's all it's all darkness but when you look at that you got to look at it from a different perspective and i and i was listening to and reading things that brother branham had to say and the most important thing like brother joe was praying the light of the world for this age that we live in is you this morning the light that they're going to see is going to be reflected from your life that's hid in jesus christ and that's why you brother thomas has been talking about every other minister that you deal with should be talking about the fact that you should be reflecting jesus christ in everything that you do and say because you're gonna you're the life for the age that we live in right now that's what they're seeing i mean you can't hide who you are from them they're gonna know who you are and what you are you can't you can't hide that but i i i wrote that down this morning and i was thinking you know i was just in perspective i was pulling i was trying to print some stuff that i was reading but brother branham always said that in this age that we live in there's no hope and brother thomas has been talking if you look at the outside world it's a pretty miserable place there's no light out there the things that are going on out there that are totally contrary to the word of god now can you convince people what they're doing is contrary to the word of god no you just got to show them but there's a way to live a life that's totally sure before the living god you just got to be who god made you to be and and i was thinking this morning everyone here that's sitting here listening or from the beginning to the end everyone here has to come the same way and i was just like everyone will have a relationship with jesus christ everyone will have his own personal experience with the lord and it's what you're going to hit your like brother branham always talked about is what you're going to hit your horse do it's what you're going to hit your heart and your soul to that experience you have with the word of god where god you know that god come into your life and god has talked to you he's spoken through his word back to you i always try to say that it's not what i think it's not what someone else thinks it's what god's word thinks in any given situation uh i you know no one has any any a personal opinion in it this morning and we all have that experience this morning that we have to hit yourselves too am i hitching into an emotion or no i'm hissing it to what god has done for me in my life and where i have come from and everyone here sitting this morning is in the same boat you all came from one place and are moving to another place and you all had that experience in your life i hope where god has spoken to you through his word and you know that you're a child of god uh you can't manufacture that you can't make that that's something that god's got to do for you and you gotta just release it to him you know like i was saying uh there's a there's a book that sits on my desk at home i read it all the time you all know i'm what i'm about to say some of you because you've heard me so long i i read that pilgrim's progress boo book time and time again i i just liked that book i've always read that book for the last 40 years i keep reading that book during the 40 years and there's some real truth in that book real life experience and the age we're in right now is like when christian had just come out of vanity fair and he's and hopeful joins him and then they get off the path and the giant captures them and that's the age we're in right now you've got to stay on that path you got to stay on that trail you can't you have to walk the walk that god shows you and everyone is that giant of despair is out there on that world this morning we're all going to fight that giant of despair there's always going to be something trying to come into your life to get you to run after something that has no meaning and that's the purpose of your enemy this morning is to get you on a track that runs you after something that in the end won't profit at you won't do anything for you the only thing that matters the only thing that counts is your relationship with jesus christ and anything that's clouding that up this morning it shouldn't be there and uh i'll just read and you all know that i read you can tell that i read these chapters and john a lot because this page is out of my bible already and it's not that old but i really believe this you're a vine you're going to represent something this morning you're either a good vine or a bad vine this morning you're representing the truth or the hour that we live in or you're representing something else but i'll just read a few of these scriptures here this morning i am the true vine and my father is the husband men every branch in me that birth not fruit he takes away every branch that bear with branch that bear fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit and that's everyone knows in their life like i said i say this a lot but i can only speak for myself as a man you know whether god's pruning you and you know whether you're growing in the faith this morning you know where you came from and where you're headed and you know in your life what god has added to you so you know you can examine where you're at this morning and he goes now you are creating through the word which i have spoken on you inviting me and i in you and as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more no more can you except you abide in me and that's what i'm really saying this morning you have to be abiding in jesus christ this morning anything outside of that it won't mean anything and you'll have a you won't have any victory in your life if you're outside of that it's got to be in christ everything that you do and i am the true vine and you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing and if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned but if you abide in me my words abide in you you shall ask but you will and it should be done unto you aaron is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so you shall be my disciples and as the father hath loved me so so so have i loved you continuing my love and i'm gonna jump over here this morning and then i'm going to just jump over in the 16th chapter here and like and some of the stuff and jesus says these things have i spoken on to you that you should not be offended you know everyone was offended in jesus christ because of the things he was saying and i'm thinking this morning you i'm gonna finish with what no matter what you say or what you do you can't make people like you you can't make people trust you they have to see your lives this morning and see that you're really what you say you are and then they'll listen to you you can't make people do the right thing you can't force people to do the right thing it's something that they've got to choose to do and the only way they'll choose to go and walk the right way is that you represent jesus christ one you know a lot of times you you you can pray for it you can believe for it but actually like uh i firmly believe in this age it's totally dark that like i said brother brown always said and and there's a lot of things in the gospel of john that show us that it should be jesus christ living inside that little now but the people believe that jesus christ is living in you most people would say you're a fanatic if you tell them that but it's actually where we're at this morning god is only coming for his own he's not coming for anything else but his own and the only way you'll become one of his is that you totally yield to jesus christ this morning i know i say that a lot you know a man or a woman can never say that too much to people you know it's not me it's not you it's not anything we believe anything that we do or say it's what jesus christ does through us that makes the difference in everything that we are and will be you know when i was a young man it's actually been 40 years it was about this time four years ago you know god was dealing with me you know 40 years i'm almost 62 years old and 40 years goes like it's just yesterday you know what i mean it's 40 it was what 1981 in the late summer early october of this very year that god was dealing you know everyone knows that god deals with you god's been dealing with some people god deals with a lot sometimes it's later in life you know brother branham always said that most of the time god gets hold of that that man or that woman when they're young it doesn't mean that he doesn't get a hold of you when you're a hundred either but you know everyone has that experience where god is going to reach down and touch your life and like i started with a few minutes ago you have to have your anchor your anchor has to be in the word of god and where you know that god is leading you in the right direction and here i am i'm almost 62 years old and it's been a journey for 40 years and i was just thinking this morning does jesus christ in my heart mean to me at almost 62 what it did to me when i was 21 22 years ago oh and i i guess that's where we have to think as you get older does god mean just as much to me this morning as he did to me when i was 21 22 years old and is that experience that i had with him as a 22 year old is that still holding me today and that's how i have to examine myself do i still have that same zeal do i have still have that same presence with me almost 62 that i did when i was 22. brother david man you love him this morning the stand and sing that little course because he lives this morning and because he lives [Music]

amen god bless you this morning let's sing that little course turn your eyes upon jesus's brother thomas comes this morning oh turn your eyes upon jesus in his wonderful faith and the things of earth will grow strangely in the light of his glory and grace once again is brother tom comes oh just her your eyes are born jesus yes [Music] god lord you [Music] [Music] amen you can be seated for a minute i mean i asked uh our family from north carolina brother mark where's brother marquette hey man you're going to come up say a couple words for us this morning amen always good to have brother martin speaks to jackie with us amen so praise the lord i hadn't seen him since just now yet this weekend today so good but amen well it's always something good to say when you're in church i just want to thank the lord for his grace and his mercy and you know the older i get the more i appreciate his word and especially this end time message that he's revealed to us and restore to us done through the edges i usually pray lord if i ever turn my back on this just take me home you know especially when you see so much going on these days of of people um you know turning back after being it for so many years you know i just can't comprehend that but just talking with my wife and about that um i just it's something i just can't comprehend because where are you gonna go if you leave this you know i came out of the denominations and um there's there's nothing there and to go back to that i just it's just uncomprehensible to me and i just thank the lord for his absolute truth um in the word and um you know sometimes i think a lot of times we kind of live we come a little bit sheltered when we are among believers of like precious faith but when you go in among you know unbelievers like work you know um it's a total different uh kind of scenario and um sometimes you're you're called upon to stand for what you believe because there come a time where everybody will have to stand you just can't hide among the crowd and just keep it through they'll start to test you in some way and um i know at work um there was a um this girl she's getting married and i thought well that's wonderful but then i heard she was getting married to another girl and it was so it was kind of shocking to me because um you know it's all coming out in open now and bad thing is the law is protecting that so sin is being protected and then at some point you have to take a stand regardless of if the government or whoever you know pass laws it says you need you know you should go along with it because god's word is what our lives are dictated by so they they passed along a card you know of um you know congratulations you know on the whole department i don't know it's 30 something people you know would sign the card so he put it on my desk to sign and i and after knowing um the fact about this person getting married to another girl i thought i can't sign this and i and i told him i said you know i can't go along with this i mean because it's it's against it all that i stand for it's against god's word and they had a big party you know and they invited me and i couldn't go how could i go and celebrate and be joyful something that's contrary i mean you didn't have to have a revelation right that's wrong and then and then rejoice in that kind of thing and um of course when you take a stand you're marked so so you know but who are you gonna you know you're gonna get man's approval god's approval you know so always take a stand for god's word regardless of the consequence that the world would you know you get shunned okay i mean to take a stand for god's word is not all you know rejoicing and so on because you'll be shunned you'll be talked about you know and so on but in the end what does it matter you see that's what god um dictates and there just a few other day this fella right next door um he said he changed his name and i thought really what did you change his name was oliver okay i thought wow oh there's a wonderful name and he said he changed his name and i thought why did you change your name too he said i changed my name to phoenix and i said that he said well oliver was too masculine and i thought what you know if if my parents had named me hulk or gunther that would have been fine with me hey you know i'm a man of small stature anything helps you know but you know they change his name to suit his lifestyle you see so phoenix means that you know we rise from the ashes and so on the bird and i thought well you're rising from the ashes aren't you i told them but um brethren you there come a time when you have to take a stand there'll be a set of circumstances that will surround you and if you're not grounded in god's word and filled with the spirit those set of circumstances will just suck you right back out into the world you have to have a anchor that holds you and of course it's not us that order ourselves it's the holy spirit so i'm just so very thankful i'm glad to every time come to church and see believers and fellowship with you and it makes my heart glad when i see the church you know packed and um a lot of people have like precious fate so i'm very thankful for that and i'm just a word of testimony there's always something good to say give god glory and he's the one that keeps us and hopefully like i said older i get i just look forward to his coming and god bless you all it's it's good to be here thank you thank you better mark amen i think that was a sermon in itself don't you think amen praise the lord we don't i don't think we realize amen but you know being on the net and everything and people hear what you say and amen it's certainly amen uh should i say you have to either stand or you don't stand and you may be a good bit persecuted and i don't think that uh i don't think we've seen even hardly the beginning of persecution because you we know we know what is going on out there as far as persecuting anything that is right is that right and it's it's coming you know it's coming and so but i don't care amen because i only care about that right and so uh we just take a stand for the lord amen and when he gets ready to take us out of here we leave you amen praise the lord cd oh all right sound all right test that good amen um i think that'll be off of the music thank you i want to give a little report amen on our missionary endeavor in uganda probably about a month and a half ago or so brother jim from vancouver texted me and uh he wrote me a text and they said i'm going to read it to you and then lord willing if it's okay next weekend we'll take another missionary offering amen we already have several thousand in the missionary offering but we want to give everybody a chance to give to missions because it's the thing that god has told us to do not going into all the world and it is very very necessary and he can't go wrong doing missions amen and so we definitely want to do that i know in the last year so we haven't really done as much as what i had wanted to because of covet and everything and they couldn't build over there in uganda for a while because of the covet but they have taken off and done it and so i'm just going to read this to you dear brother byler greetings in the name of the lord jesus christ i just wanted to send you some church building pictures and i'll try to get those downloaded so we can see them perhaps next sunday morning as we use some of your funds to complete some of the buildings we are finding that prices are varying depending on locations just as they would in north america especially in land costs we are able to works with the discretion given to us from yourselves and others who are burdened for building churches in uganda we have a fund that we keep keep track of that all funds for church constructions are put together and used for that purpose this year we have completed nine buildings so far amen so praise be to god let's give the lord a hand amen and have purchased one extra plot of land thank you for your support and work whether the gym dot minister cloverdale bible way like i said i've got several pictures here that i want to learn and then it's i haven't quite got the trick yet but i think i got to download it to my computer and then put it on the sd card and we'll get you some pictures so amen so we're thankful for that that we can amen have have amen to see that happen praise the lord amen next sunday morning i know it's fourth of july and some of you'll be in ohio and so forth but we do want to have communion service next sunday morning amen right after the morning service so that everybody gets to participate is that all right amen so that's what we want to do amen i guess it's salah instead of sila salah all right salah amen and westerman so we're very happy to have amen in addition to our church family amen praise the lord we're so glad for that amen as we mentioned wednesday amends and we're very thankful that she's doing well everything going good amen did she have a home birth all right my wife told me that and i said well we weren't the only ones crazy then [Laughter] yeah that's right so i know caleb i think caleb was was born at home and so uh but anyway uh praise the lord everything worked out good amen praise god so we're thankful for that god bless you let's stand this morning simple little thought the lord laid on my heart to speak on for a while amen let's just bow our heads lord jesus we come before you father this morning once again thankful lord to be gathered together in your name lord jesus believers of like faith we know lord jesus that when faith of this proportion comes together anything is possible lord father we truly believe that with you all things are possible lord this morning we ask god that you'll just come down in a special way and speak to our hearts now the words that you want us to hear lord jesus come with your presence and with your spirit lord and feed your people from the word of god we're hungry lord jesus and we want to be fed lord so we ask god that as we read your word lord jesus and open up the bible father that this word would feed your people lord jesus we ask god forgiveness of anything any the body has done wrong this last week father lord jesus even as we came to church lord and before we come god we made sure that we had clean clothes we washed ourselves lord and lord so that we cut a church clean but father how much more necessary it is lord do we come to church clean in our hearts and on our souls washed in the blood of the land ready to heat the lamb ready to hear from you this morning lord jesus father i ask god that you'll just bless the meditation of our heart now in jesus christ's name amen and amen wednesday night but there have been no rod will be with us amen so you all remember that amen amen i want us i want to speak this morning on god our supplier amen our supplier amen so we'll turn to genesis go all the way back to genesis amen we'll take adam and eve as an illustration to begin with and see where the lord will take us from there genesis 3. genesis 3 and verse 22 and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now least he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning but abandon makes a statement about adam and eve and especially about adam and talking about in the beginning he says when he didn't have to shift for himself god provided everything that he had need of praise be to god think about that god provided everything that he had need of all right but after he got reckless and shiftless and so forth and done wrong and sin separated him from god then he had to shift for himself amen now jesus came to redeem this man back into the care of the hands of the loving father amen redemption brought back replaced put in position listen to this he says when a man will walk for god and walk with god god will walk with that man but when that same individual turns us back from god then god just lets him shift for himself amen and we find it is a bad thing that when we have to ship for ourselves faith be to god how many thankful for a heavenly father that cares about you he cares for you and philippians 4 amen and verse 19 paul said just in christ jesus glory oh my aren't you glad that you ain't got no covet problem in heaven you ain't got no shortage of supplies in heaven like we do down here amen every one of us is finding that man you can't get this and you can't get that no you know because his factory was shut down this was stuck down i'm sure glad it ain't that way with god amen he ain't shut down yet now the day will come when he's gonna shut down isn't that right that's right when he comes and leaves that mercy seat people will go to begging for mercy they'll throw themselves at the elders say god help me but there ain't gonna be no help anymore oh aren't you glad that you're not a sinner this morning without god having to do everything yourself amen you can't rely upon the supernatural to take care of you amen and i wanted you to know there's people that don't think that god amen is intimate about amen taking care of people's needs but i want you to know he is we have a supernatural god that provides for us he is our provider and he's a good one isn't he a good one amen go ahead take a deep breath he provided you with that right there every breath you take has been given to you when he decides to take it away that will be the end of you here amen adam eve the most terrible terrible thought the most terrible scene that you can imagine is when he had sinned against god and god took a whip and said get out of here it said he drove him up get out of here adam get out of here eve the devil use your head i use a man's heart you should have listened to what that heart told you amen that heart told you that if they that you eat thereof that day you will surely die the devil come along he says no you're not surely gonna die because god doesn't know that you know if you eat of this you're going to be like gods you're going to know both good and evil huh and it was a tree to be desired it was a tree to make one wise she lusted after wisdom [Music] this right here will get you in trouble faster than what you can ever imagine think about it amen you get this here people people will put a gun to their brains because they're sick of it they can't handle it anymore it drove them crazy hello that's what this mind will do amen but it has to come from down here and then we know that god has placed a special opening they found imminent science they found a special a compartment in your heart that is not in the animal kingdom and they say that it's the place must be the place of the soul a special compartment i believe it's the control power of man amen because you have in there and you have that soul and it is supposed to be the control tower of your entire life is right here even jesus said you know he says it's not what a man eats that defiles him but it's what comes out of the mouth amen and defiles him because what comes out comes from where the heart out of the heart are all the issues of life this is where it all comes from is we're down on the inside of your inside praise be to god oh my we want to talk this morning with the help of the lord about being ready how many know jesus said be ready for you know not the day nor the hour that the lord will come oh i'm so glad this morning that if there's one thing that's sure it's not my word it's not a man's word this here is the only word that's sure amen and if you repeat this then you're saying the right words amen because jesus said heaven and earth will pass away but this will never pass away it doesn't matter how many mockers come in the last days and say where is the promise of thy coming for since our fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were huh well let me tell you some things ain't continue like they were are they they're changing fast but yeah they were continuing like it was in the days of lot like it was in the days of sodom isn't that right homosexuality it all continues like that but oh my think about that was just before the fire fell christ is coming jesus is coming he's going to return if you could just genuinely believe that with all your heart to know without a shadow of doubt that jesus is coming back he's coming back folks and when he does he's going to come back in what they call in the bible he says behold the day of the lord comes both cruel and it's going to be a horrible thing when he comes back to this earth right the wrath of god is going to get poured out upon mankind just like it was in the days of noah every man woman and child died from the flood so the fire is going to fall and burn the earth with fervent heat and all the things are in there going to be burnt up isn't that right when he comes the day of the lord it's going to come but we know that before that day comes and before he comes back in that manner we know that he says you know that there's going to be a rapture that takes place we which are alive and remain unto his coming shall be caught up together to meet the lord in the air two will be in the field two will be in bed one will be taken and the other one will be left in that right she will be working but he'll come as a thief in the night and he'll catch his little waiting people away because he's not going to destroy the just with the wicked he didn't destroy noah with the wicked he didn't destroy a lot with the wicked isn't that right he never give the same punishment to the believer as it does the unbeliever amen he makes a way of asking aren't you glad that he provides everything folks i can't help it when i think about god and who he is i just get a little excited when i think about what god is not about what we are but what he is and how that he provides folks i thank god for air conditioning how many likes how many would like to sit right there and pour sweat just torn off of you you like that no or how about having to not get enough coats on it's freezing in here i mean why because we and we don't like the july weather do we go ahead out there in that 105 feet index go out there and say i just love this you're probably lying unless you got some really cold blood uh but we as human beings we like it in the spring and the fall i love it i i like that 50s and 70s weather why because it's just right do you realize that god had killed it he's gonna he could turn the temperature up and he probably will after a while but he had and because of the fall and the tilting of the earth we know that we have it out of cater right now it would all be the same nice rather all the time if things were in line but things are not more online that's why it gets a little too cold it gets a little too hot come on folks how many weather people do we have in here that likes good weather well i'm so glad that god provides and he wants us to be comfortable he wants it to be just right in your life he don't want you to be a miserable naked blind poor person and neither does he wants to and to be anything else but just the way that god wants it to be are you with me this morning we thank god for the comfort and it doesn't don't you know that god wants to provide everybody with comfort everybody wants comfort and what did he provide he provided us with a comforter if i don't go away the comforter can't come and he made it so that it doesn't matter how wicked and how cold and how cool the world is it don't even matter so much the tribulation in the trials that he might lead you through you can still say well praise be to god huh it is well with my soul remember the man that lost his wife his children in the boat amen in the ocean and the boat went down when he went over a boat over that same spot he got inspired to say it is well it is well with my soul aren't you glad for the comforter i mean thankful for the comforter that he provides i like that god in our spiritual self he wants everything to be just right he cares about you amen whether everything's wrong or whether he's not and how many knows that god leads his children along he leads us in many different ways and he doesn't always lead us just to flowery beds of ease no but i'll tell you this if you are in christ and in christ's care and you know that he's providing for you it doesn't matter how many dead-end roads you come to how many red seas you come to and you don't know how you're going to cross isn't that right oh god wanted to hear from the children of israel when he took him down to that red sea and they couldn't go back because the egyptians were coming all he wanted to hear was i love him and i know that he's going to take care of me and then we are just just give god praise anyway just like paul when he was in prison oh he had his he had his seats and stalks and everything else and he began to just praise the lord begin to pray and praise the lord and the angels come and open up the doors he didn't need nobody to bail him out the angels build him out god makes a way when you're in god's care god makes away am a personal witness folks many of us sitting here are a personal witness that when you come up to the places you don't know how to go over it you can't go under you can't go around and you don't know which way to go which way do you go when you don't know which way to go how about this way that's a good way to go right there that's a good way to go say lord i can't stand anymore i don't know how to go forward anymore so i'm just going to go down and i'm going to say god here this is for you i can't handle this i need you to handle this oh i've heard so many illustrations already of of the three hebrew children and how they didn't know which way to go they were in stocks and they were bound and they were being led to the fire but they trusted in their god and he made a way took the very heat out of the fire oh took the very heat out of the fire aren't you glad that god makes way god always makes the way he forgives you comfort he makes a way always with every trial everything comes your way he makes a way of escape it would really be bad if he didn't make it away wouldn't it he'd be stuck in that state but he always provides a way and in this generation how many of those that god has a provided way for this day when all of the evil that is coming in and it's flooding in this in the 1950s and 60s brother bannon said that the lid has come off of hell and he said you watch sin go plum to the core now you watch it get worse and worse and worse hasn't it done just that the sale of the lord has done just that it got worse and worse and worse and worse and man don't know if it's a man or woman anymore he said the world will eventually go completely insane we have arrived just a few short years ago the very people that are condoning it would have said that's insanity huh now they do it all right folks in the early 1900s if a woman went out there and she had her sh addressed up to here did i arrested her she was i did arrested her for immorality and you can look back and look at pictures of history and how it is and how did it just progress and got worse and worse and worse and worse now look at him out there didn't they get you don't know it hello but what is it god is going to make your way in this hour when that darkness and those demons of hell amen that wickedness just going to flood the earth over and it's going to consume almost everybody i like that almost praise the lord for the almost it's going to consume almost everybody but even like the bible says if god wouldn't have left them a seed we'd have all been made like unto solomon and gomorrah if god wouldn't have left us a word as you see jesus is the i was he's the word of yesterday he's the i am he's the word of today and he is the i will be he's the beginning he's the ending he's the first he's which he is and which will be he's all of it if god wouldn't have left us a word and the way that god has made for this hour god knew that we would need something powerful to get us through this you know right i mean i don't know about you but just being homies wouldn't have done it for me just being men and i wouldn't have done that all of them blaming young people they're losing young people they're losing people left and right people shifting back and forth they don't know where to go folks but when the message of the hour coming jesus christ come down here amen he did the very same things he did when he walked the shores of galilee through malachi 4. he had his picture taken with a man with a halo on the back let me tell you about this story right here i think it was mr best right challenge the prophet of god says i can i want to prove that there ain't no such a thing as divine healing and all those things and he had photographers everywhere and he wanted to get better about him on the platform put his finger up in his nose and say and condemn everything about him and all that and the angel finally told him he was in the audience he wasn't debating i believe it was brother at the bossworth that debated with him and so forth and i asked him one question and blew the whole debate out because he says there's no such divine healing in the new testament and he asked him it says all the redemptive compound redemptive names of jehovah does it apply to jesus jesus one of them with jehovah jireh i am your healer if he says yeah it applies to him that he is our healer he couldn't ask to for answer the first question but brother man did come with you with the commission of the angel go and close in prayer he says i never claim to be healer i'm not a healer i only represent jesus christ and so forth amen and quickly yeah miss smith had his had his people go up and put his finger up and everything i'll take pictures and guess what none of the pictures came out none of them come out except that one only one folks i'm a believer that ain't gonna tell me that now i you can't tell me a camera doesn't work any better than that that's just what god wanted it to develop he was showing you and me this morning that this is who i'm with this is the very same pillar of fire that led the children of israel thousands of years ago amen everywhere they went why and time after time never again never through the dark ages did christ come in such a way as he did in this hour discern the thoughts of the people's heart heal the sick 13 people raised from the dead did all kinds of miracles and signs and wonders until you wouldn't have the doubt but it has to be god that's why i stand here because we have something sure something that you know that you know that you know that you know something i would take a bullet in my head any day for i would gladly die for the message of the hour it's jesus christ coming and showing himself alive after two thousand years called god knew i'll send you elijah the prophet before the great and dread paul and peter and all of them aren't you glad that god has provided a way in our day you can there's only two ways that's your way or god's way it's not my way and then god come and do my way no there's going to be way too many people amen that's going to be disappointed on that hour you know even jesus says you know i'm going to provide robes there's a wedding and and the one that had the wedding furnish the guests with robes isn't that right at the door they furnish every grass rich or poor with a robe and when he comes in there and when he got to his marriage and suppose there was a man in there that did not have a robot how many believes that jesus christ provides us with the robe you don't try to make your own like adam did don't try to make your own righteousness like adam no it has to be his righteousness we come god's way or you don't come amen there was a guest in there did not have the robe on now how many knows that if you ain't got the righteousness the pure clean white linen of the saints amen imminent of the righteousness of jesus christ then your own righteousness it says what filthy rags there was a guy coming there ain't that he had been working perhaps a mechanic and he got up in that oil and he got dirty there's hardly anybody gets more dirty than a mechanic he had that dirt and grease all over him and then the master come says what are you grease monkey doing in here what are you doing you know robot you're sturdy filthy what'd he do called the guards ushers take him out find him hand and foot and cast him in the hollow darkness there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of faith and it comes on the other way and through jesus christ that god has provided they're going to be cast out into the tribulation period and when them atomic bombs come and they begin to feel them heat wave their teeth will nash and their they'll gnaw their tongues for pain as they die they will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth oh my aren't you glad that god made the way oh my with everybody is sad and blue huh folks how you can go go you can try crack cocaine you can try all of that stuff you can try whatever you want there ain't nothing going to give you happiness and joy except jesus christ huh the other it'll destroy you it'll destroy your family it'll destroy everything it's a destroyer not right but god brings you together it causes you to love your wife more it causes you to love your husband more it brings the family together that's what god provides joy unspeakable peace that passes understanding you just can't explain what it's like to have your heart right with god that's right listen i want to preach on forgiveness but now i'm gonna in en envelop it in it if it's all right god provided forgiveness huh because he knew after adam fell that we were some rascals he knew that we were some sinners he knew we were far from perfect he realized that we'd fall short isn't that right amen and uh amen and we know that he told abraham when he was up there offering his son and so forth and the son asked him we have the wood and the fire but where's the sacrifice amen and abraham says god will provide himself a sacrifice that's exactly what god did he provided himself came man amen who had a sacrifice died for your sins and for my sins so that you could have forgiveness 490 times a day if that's what you needed but he knew that we needed some serious forgiveness aren't you thankful he provided forgiveness for us because without forgiveness you can't be right with god we need forgiveness every day amen and i thank god for that forgiveness that brings us back into fellowship back into a place to where we can have god run our life oh aren't you glad for that i'm so thankful for that listen when god made man brother barron says he says he made him thus he made him a certain compartment in the throne room of his heart he says god wants to lead man but man wants to lead himself jesus said my sheep know my voice how many knows that we are considered sheep sheep have to be led that's our problem so many times we let our head lead us instead of god through the heart lead us every one of us was meant every man was made to have god on the throne room of that heart you know the good thing that god made when he made man he provided us with what we call a thirst am i right that's why a lot of us is sitting here this morning because we're thirsting for something we need something more there's got to be more to life than this huh we want more of god we have i who have been a christian for i don't know how many years close to 40 maybe i still want more of him i still thirst blessed are they which hunger and thirst for they are not going to get what i provide for them no for they shall be filled god is in the filling business how many believes that he wants us everyone to be filled to overflowing but it's our own ways to get in the way we have to let go all right can i read some more listen he wants to lead himself therefore there is a war constantly the man wants to go after the things that he sees with his eyes is that right and that's where he's deceived that's where eve was deceived because the things that she could see now paul said we knew look not to the things that are seen but the things are not seen because the things that are seen are what temporal but the things that are not seen are eternal oh my you see me happy this morning you see the fire burning it's the unseen and you please lord i need more of you lord will you touch me will you come and give me the baptism of the holy spirit will you fill me with your power and he does how do you know well i hate to go by feelings but you'll feel it when it happens you'll know when it happens oh yeah when god comes down in your heart and he does something for you i like brother brother brian's testimony 40 some odd years huh 20-something years old how was how was you when he accepted the lord brother 22 i think i was married at 22 so it's around 20 that i accepted so just a couple of years apart and look at us old men now huh i want to say well if you're 52 53 you're not old yet but when you get close to 60 you might as well confess it you're old now but i'll tell you this right now is something that holds you i like brother mark's testimony i said that just a few weeks ago we're talking about how that you know if you're really a son of god if you're really one of god's children and he has saved you it's for eternity it's not just for 20 25 years brothers mark i'm convinced that folks that even preachers i i know preachers that have preached for a very very long time amen a family member their dad died a couple years later they're announcing the message announcing everything what there's something not right down here god don't do a work like that it's a pretender somebody that can do it with their mind and so forth but it's got to be here way down in your soul it's for time and eternity when god does it amen you love him oh my but notice how that not he's let me say this and he says you notice a man or a woman that tries to walk after the things of this world amen what the bible says what is what is the things of the world the lust of flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life if you've got the love of the world in you the love of the father isn't in you because all of these things are going to pass away we are looking for christ to come we're going to live with him for a thousand years there's a new heaven a new earth we're in dwell of unrighteousness no not one bit of sin is going to be over there amen we're looking for that we look at the unseen not the things that we can see he says look if you ever if you just look at the things of the world you never can please god amen but a man a woman that will look at the but just go according to the leading of the spirit they're usually in the will of god paul said that the children of god are what led by the spirit of god praise be to god how many believes it's important that we are led by the spirit of god not just by the things that we see how many knows in the age that we live in the sight and the sight thing is stronger than ever amen not just for wanting things amen but the lust of the flesh all of that is stronger than ever and you have to be stronger than ever in the lord to overcome [Applause] and close your eyes and say look we know that this is all going to pass away folks i'm here to tell you it's not going to last much longer not going to last much longer it's getting too evil the cup of iniquity is really starting to trickle over the edge a little bit it's full fixing to run over and god is fixing to take it out he's going to bring a change how many thankful for that praise be to god so many times that god with his people was always there to provide a way remember when the children of israel they begin to complain and they murmur and the dev and the lord brought in serpents snakes to bite the people isn't that right he bite the people and thousands of them die because of their complaining but then god made it away from the live and they took a serpent and they put him up on a pole a brass pole and that serpent represented your nature your evil nature that has to go to calvary and die and that right put on the pole and then they even have it on the ambulances now that it was a type of you look upon that serpent he said and live kind of some strange thing to look at isn't it but look upon your old nature being dead and it'll bring you life in that right it'll bring you life if you'll die to your own nature amen praise be to god with every temptation the bible says with every temptation that comes your way god always makes a way of escape aren't you glad that god makes a way of escape no matter what the trial is no matter what the test is if you really seek it with all your heart say god there's got to be a way here and he'll open up a path sometimes it's not like we figure it all but i don't know about you but i really really like it when i know that it was not me clearing the way but you know that it was god opening up the path aren't you glad for god's leading folks if you're not being led by god if you don't have a great heavenly father like like a son and daughter of god does you're in a whole lot of trouble praise be to god god is good isn't he amen we've got in the dog business a little bit me and my wife have and when i look at the birth of a dog and the instinct that a dog has now we know that this is in all nature and that right that there's things that's put in the instinct of nature now i want to say this that if anybody ever studied nature if you take a close look at nature whether it's geese that were born somewhere but they automatically know where to find next all the different things you would it would almost be enough to save you to make you know that that dumb animal can't be that smart because no matter how many generations it's passed down they all know what to do just like i was talking about the birth of a dog that dog has to know that within a minute or two it has to open that puppy out of the bag and that right it's got to clear its mouth and so forth to make sure it can get a breath and then it has to cut the biblical core that's a pretty smart animal isn't that right and get all of that and that's just one instance of many things that is in nature itself amen as the prophet put he says you know that uh up in the north those ducks will go up north and dale they'll burst a bunch of baby ducks and so forth to grow by fall all of a sudden maybe the first cool wind that comes there'll be a certain duck certain male duck that'll all of a sudden go to quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack y'all weren't expecting this in church would you all of a sudden he'll go to quacking he'll fly over towards the middle of the pond and guess what all the other ducks quack quack quack quack quack quack quack i'm flocking around that one mill bird bill look at that now barnes this is what are you trying to tell us what are you trying to tell us and when he gets them all together they're all quacking they're all having a revival folks i believe that's the way it's going to be before this bride leaves amen the pressure is going to bring this church together amen you're going to hear a bunch of amen hallelujah it is about time to go amen i believe i'm going to see my loved one anytime now the time of the rapture is that [Music] god provides the animal kingdom with an instinct for survival and that right if he would provide them for an instinct for survival wouldn't he provide us with an instinct for survival when we know that it's getting cold outside it is getting real cold outside it's time to fly to a warmer place it's time to go into heavenly atmosphere into a heavenly place and then let's gather together a minute a certain cracker he'll crack and they'll just all follow him and all of a sudden he'll take to the skies and all the others take a bath when they head down for the louisiana rice paddies or whatever they head back down the warmer place and they follow that god provides us with leadership how many is that for leadership jesus said my sheep hear my voice not only here but this my sheep know my voice but in the days of the voice of the silent angel when he begins shall begin to sound mystery of god shall be finished he has declared to his servants the prophets every one of us sitting here most most of us anyway are message believers when proud when brother man of money would preach a message on those tapes and when he preached that message there was something about it wasn't it there was something about it now it wasn't necessarily the the uh i don't know what you call on the octaves of his voice isn't that right even though that had something to do with it because when he said come out of heart my people he caught his attention but when he told us about the baptist methodist presbyterian all these different religions what is right that caught our attention in it what is it because jesus said you know i speak the truth and my word has no place and you don't hear it you don't hear the truth he says the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free it's what he said it's the truth that you hear that you know is right even this morning it isn't the sound of my voice but it's what i say amen that you're supposed to hear amen and even jesus said my sheep hear my voice they know the truth oh my how different it would be if brother mark or me would come up say that we you know you can you can just kind of participate just don't let them know where you stand and stuff that's right it wouldn't sound right would it be you know we would rather we would rather die than to compromise on the truth we would rather give our life than to knock down to some because listen if brother mark listen if he went over to that party he'd had to go home and revenge because he participated in evil in a celebration of evil which that holy spirit in him no i'm not even signing that card if i signed it it'd be repent or perish it wouldn't like that signature too much but yet guess what that would be nothing but the truth that unless they repent they're going to burn in hell period that goes for any sinner doing anything wrong amen repent or perish hallelujah so god provided us in this hour with not just a man not just a preacher but christ himself to come down and confirm that what was said was the truth two confirmations with signs following according to acts acts and matthew says they went out preaching the gospel and signs followed them and they're right it has the number one match up with this bible and then god comes out and he confirms it well if you just believe both of those you're going to be in a whole lot of trouble amen he leads he he absolutely in all of nature amen you say that's nature that's not nature that is god having put something in every one of those little creatures and then last night me and my wife is sitting out on a recliner in the yard well no he wasn't we was sitting there but this is not when it happened but anyway my wife is cleaning things up we'll see leave it at that and i said honey there was a couple of big old cranes were flying up through there i said honey take a minute stop what you doing and look up look at some big old birds look how beautiful he's running flying across our pine trees over through there i said look at that how beautiful that is then there was a straggler here comes another one praise be to god and i says you know there's going to be birds flying around in heaven how many knows that it reminded me of when hope came back to brother bannon when he called her back he says he was beautiful birds were flying from tree to tree that's what she said amen i believe will have birds over there but god back this up that god put that in each every creature and if people would look at that and realize hey that can't just happen by chance a divine architect put that in there i'll tell you what that's why that's why i believe that any christian loves nature we love nature because it's so unique it's a miracle in itself to think just of the leadership of the different animals and so forth and how they're led now that you and i are supposed to be led amen let me come down towards the close of the service but i want to talk to you about priorities priorities would that be okay because if you don't have your priorities right then you don't really have now i believe a child of god is watched over by god but god brings you the place of repentance he watches you over as you sinner but you don't have the blessings like a believer does how many knows that and this is where he gets right down and we can really take something home with us this morning is that okay so let's turn to matthew if you will this is one of one of many of my favorite scriptures in the bible when it talks about god's providence and god's care amen and how god takes care of us how did he is our supplier and it actually this has a i want to try to bring out the deeper meaning of this if i can with the help of the lord matthew 6 we'll begin with verse 21. notice here first he says where your treasure is there will your heart be also how many knows your heart really needs to be in the right place and verse 24 he says no man can serve two masters shall either hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon amen i don't know all right so now verse 25 therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life or what you shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for the body what ye shall put on is not the life more than the meat and the body than raymond behold the fowls of the air they so not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them hallelujah in the wintertime when it's cold the snow is covered everything up deer by practically eating the bark off the tree isn't that right how many knows according to this that god cares about the birds out there even though they don't store anything up god still watches over them he's a caring god amen verse 25 gives us a hint of what we are to think about what take no thought for your life so it actually tells us what we are to think about now ye are much more better than they now i want to go down to verse 30. wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe ye o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the americans the germans huh the russians north koreans that's this is what all the nations of the world think seek after that's all they think about it is their food their clothes huh where they it's their houses their vehicles that's all that they meditate upon now notice for after all these things to the gentile seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need now how many knows that whenever you're before you can have something supplied there has to be a need huh and your heavenly father knows that you have need of d things of all the things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be supplied for you how many believes that now talking about if you want a heavenly father to take care of you then he's beginning to tell you what your state of mind is what he's requiring of you what he's requiring of me if he's going to take care of you now we know that our priorities for the most part let me not our not ourselves so much not if you're a christian but the world's priorities there's there's three let's talk about three priorities one of them is yourself the other one is uh your family huh the other one is supposed to be god three priorities and that's pretty much the way the world has it is myself first because people man they don't care about their family they just care about themselves that what leads to divorces people are too selfish they don't think about what your mate wants that's where they run into problems huh that's where it is right there the shelf first because in the last days the bible says men shall be lovers of themselves any high-minded truth-breakers and so forth amen but normally you think about your family amen before yourself but then your family maybe and then most people well if i get time i'll think about god how many knows that's not the way priorities are supposed to be now notice here that even jesus is saying here why are you even thinking and for ourself what is the first thing we think about ourselves if you're thinking about yourself well have i got nice clothes do i eat good but he says don't even you shouldn't even worry about that you shouldn't even worry about whether you've got good food deed or clothes to wear now we're getting stronger isn't it because you got to remember that jesus didn't have a place to lay his head he didn't have no bank account he had to go catch some fish and get some coins out of fish's mouth to pay his taxes with see oh my all right y'all getting quiet now is that all right jesus said in another place he says if a man loves his father or mother or brother or wife children more than me and that right then you're not worthy of me so if your family is before god god's not obligated to you huh you don't have your priorities right if you got your family before god if you got your wife before god or your husband before god your priorities still aren't right you have to have him first another place he says if a man is not willing to forsake all that he has he cannot be my disciple in other words you've got to be willing to forsake everything he is number one [Music] we have a lot better lives if we got our priorities right we could be a different person we get our priorities right why let me just say something else that i've seen that happens to us is that we rely too much on other people to supply us with what we have need up in different places i heard the prophet talk about he says about the jericho road how did there's only room on a jericho road listen let me just read it um he says listen man whoever amounts to anything is a man that stands alone with god him and god alone that's the man see on the jericho road there's room for just two no more and no less and that's you and jesus now how many knows that does not say that you can't be with your wife oh my goodness no if your wife's a christian that's a big plus if your family is a christian that's a big plus but it's all pluses because there's many other people that come to christ a woman come to christ and the man i don't want no part of it i'm sorry but i'm going to surrender my life to god i don't want to party anymore i don't want to do all of this anymore the man might leave her and divorce her it might happen huh even jesus said i didn't come to bring peace but a sword to bring at variance husband wife daughter-in-law brother-in-law there's a variance there if they don't want to follow jesus i'm still going to go on don't none go with me yet will i follow in order to get our priority in order to have the kind of master kind of savior amen that's going to supply everything for us just like a wife isn't supposed to have to worry about the finances of the house that's her husband's job hey man he is she is completely in his care he better get out there and work till his hands bleed to make sure she is supplied for she can be in the kitchen and house praising the lord and just having all kinds of good times she don't have to get no gray hair no worry she's married she has a husband that takes care of him go ahead amen i'll say it for you that's the truth that's the way our relationship with him that's what god wants us to do he loves for us to rely on him jehoshaphat had a whole army coming against him way more he could never handle he fell on his knees and dressed in cyclops and he never had to lift the blade god destroyed them all all they did was go and get all the jewels and all kinds of gold and stuff off of their bodies god fought their battles for him because he relied upon god god supplied his need i think we could all come to the altar and say god i worry too much about my clothes my electric bill food and i worry too much about it and i don't think enough about you lord my mind isn't completely on being right and ready oh i was thinking about ready you know and i thought you know i've preached before ready or not christ is coming i don't really believe that's true it's true for the unbeliever but i know that god is going to have a bride with a spot and she is going to be ready if he said be ready i believe she's going to be ready and i thought well thomas bottler look at your faults look at your failures maybe i'm what's keeping this whole thing up are you ready are you keeping the rapture from coming are you holding him up do you need a closer walkway are you not in the place that you ought to be the one thing that i want to ask ourselves is the one thing that i see in my life and that is that i'm itching closer and closer it may not be a big great big step it might be small steps but as long as i'm getting a little closer to christ than i was last week huh how many is that as long as you're making little steps towards god then you can rejoice say well look i see improvement here god is helping me just get a little bit at a time huh but you sure don't want to be going the other way if we go back the other way it won't be long that our women will rest wrong dress wrong huh we'll have blue hair we'll have tattoos no drinks if we go the wrong way but no i want to see us more modest i want to see let us be modest in a modest apparel the bible says huh our brothers oh boy here we go man of the house the spiritual leader of the house treats his wife like christ treats the church and gives himself for her bible says that a man that is married seeks the things of the world how did he can go ahead please his wife your wife ought to have a smile on her face no you don't go get that boo new bow and arrow and then they'll buy her no pots and pans we ain't got no money for that arnie and how could you buy that big old bow that was twelve hundred dollars here we go already men that love their wives have themselves i've often said if you do that your family problems are taken care of if she leaves you after you treat her like that you don't need her anyway ooh that was kind of strong wasn't it i said if she leaves you not you throw her out or something but if she leaves and you treat me real good huh that's not on you amen all right where was he seek the kingdom first take no thought for tomorrow for the marshall take care of the thought of itself sufficient for the day is the evil thereof so that's what he was saying that our minds should be on god's kingdom and us being ready to meet him at any time one more thought can i convey one more thought to you and that is the thought of relying on others for our joy for our happiness that's why i brought this out it's just you and him well i went to this church and nobody's friendly huh tell you what i was outside and people just walked by and nobody's friendly i'm not going back to that church huh folks you're going to be going to a lot of churches you see folks it's you and christ and if there ain't a friend in the world you'll be singing what a friend i have in jesus oh he's the best friend you'll ever have you might get disappointed and probably will get disappointed in your friends sooner or later a little bit am i right but this friend will never forsake you he'll never leave you you'll always be the best friend that you've ever had well nobody loves me come on folks do you realize what you have when you go tell me something somebody this is i'm going to leave it open when you have the holy ghost what have you got you have everything that you'll ever have need of in this life's journey and when you come to taking your last breath god's going to take care of you then is that right you can't rely you can't have this walk with this one and with that one you'll find yourself by the wayside it's you and god that's the walk no matter what anybody else does you're walking with god remember when jesus preached real hard and everybody left and he says to disciples are you going to leave me too he said are you going to leave me too and how many knows that they eventually did peter even denied knowing the guy three times they all forsook him he didn't have anybody but did that keep did he miss did he lose out on his course no he kept the course because him and the father him and the holy ghost right here in that right all the way to the end doesn't matter what the disciples did doesn't matter what anybody else did he had a relationship with god this brings me to mind that people and christians so time so many times need they have need uh they need attention huh they need attention well i want attention and they want to be ministered to but remember what jesus said i didn't come to be ministered you don't have to baby me you don't have to baby me i didn't come to minute be ministered to but i came to minister in other words i came to give love i came to give care i came to give it's not whether i get it back and it's that's what i come for amen and that's the way i believe christians are every one of us it doesn't matter whether people love us or not whether care for us or not my friend or not i want you to be i like lots of friends and lots of love and lots of pats on the back sure we all like that good job brother by the good decided to the other but doesn't have to have nah doesn't matter i'm still going to love people just as much anyway i'm here to minister how many is with me let's be ministers not have to be ministered to brother babe says people that need attention are people usually that are sick i'll tell you what when your wife gets sick you better give her attention isn't that right when one of us will have the need or whatever we want to give him attention and eat it but if you're spiritually healthy you shouldn't need attention amen god bless you this morning this is just what the lord laid on my heart amen thinking about the jared cole road how do we walk with him and how did he supplies everything that we have need of amen praise the lord this just comes to mind you are sitting on the very thing that i just said it was divinely provided we got this church almost done but we had no seats isn't that right and a tornado tore down a baptist church and we went to them folks i don't know who did brother john but some of us maybe brother billy or some of us asked that church what they were going to do with it if i'm not wrong they said that we could have it free of charge right completely free of charge so as you see you're sitting on god's provided way let's give the lord a hand take a minute as i close and think about your life think about what god has supplied for you when you didn't know how it was going to be happen huh think about it i'm thinking about something right now it was great it was big it was huge didn't know which way to go there god made a way now do you have a thought let's give him another hand for what he's done for you say thank you lord jesus [Applause] in closing stand with me saint john 14 jesus says behold i go and i prepare a place for you that where i am there you can be also how he's looking forward to go to that place that he's going to supply he's going to have a place ready for us amen see folks god has called me the pastor he's called me the pastor he's called me to help you get ready how many believes that that's how i want every one of us i want you ready and waiting if you go by the way the rapture that's wonderful but if you come down to the door of the grave and i've had several people go by the way of the grave that i can say this morning that i was proud of them they did not fear death when they looked it in the face when they embraced it they did not fear it there was no fear there they were ready to go that's how i want to be that's why each one of us because guess what one of these days is going to be the ultimate need that you have and that is for god to supply for you if you take your last breath you say lord into thy hands i commit my spirit huh you're gonna rely upon god at that time to take your spirit and put it in that new body you're gonna completely rely on god let me say this i believe our daily life with our heads bowed in our daily life that's what we need to do completely rely on god to lead us and to guide us and we put our complete trust and faith in him that what we have need of he knows all about it he knows behold the fowls of the air he said look at the bird i take care of them aren't you worth a lot more than that god is looking down every day and he is looking at what you're thinking about he is looking at what you are caring the most about he is looking at your heart and he's saying where is your heart because he says that wherever your treasure is that's where your heart will be also may god begin to help us each and every one every day of our life to make him the center of all that we do all that we say and all that we think lord jesus we bow our heads to you this morning and as we bow i want to ask the congregation how many in here knows that you really need to begin to focus on god more than what you do the things of this world the holy spirit spoken to you this morning said you know your focus is still not right where it should be your priorities are still not quite right i want to meet you i want to take you into disguise but first your priorities have to be right i want to be first in your life i'm worthy of that i'm god almighty i take care of you i'll care more for you than what you know that i care about you god god bless those hands it's just honest lord jesus you see our hands everywhere lord father we are supposed to be concerned lord jesus about your righteousness above the food that we daily the clothes that we wear daily you're supposed to be number one the first thing that we want lord is to be ready to meet you to be pleasing to you father and we ask this morning that you would forgive us father of where we're still short lord well we have to still shake down ourselves and ask for forgiveness for things we ask god that you bless every heart every hand this morning that has went up who wants to reconsecrate themselves see you fresh in a new way and say god lead me and guide me father i already have completely committed myself into your hands thrown myself into your hands lord and i rejoice because i know lord that you are the one that leads and that guides me and that cares about me father in jesus name amen and amen while i pray for people brother david [Music]
