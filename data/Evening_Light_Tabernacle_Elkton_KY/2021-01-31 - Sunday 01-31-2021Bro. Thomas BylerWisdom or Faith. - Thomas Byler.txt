has certainly made its rounds so we want to remember all those in prayer this morning suffering with covet and different ailments and just ask the lord to move on them in a mighty way touch their bodies heal them restore their strength it's my understanding it takes a lot out of you so i just need the prayer of the brothers and sisters so brother john hershberger would you open a service in prayer this morning yes lord yes yes lord hey man if you would turn your bibles to the book of psalms we'll read chapter 26. book of psalms chapter 26. judge me o lord for i have walked in thine integrity i have trusted also in the lord therefore i shall not slide for thy loving kindness is before mine eyes and i have walked in thy truth i have hated the congregation of evil doers and will not sit at with the wicked that i may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell all thy wondrous works gather not my soul with the sinners nor my life with the bloody man but as for me i will walk in mine integrity redeem me and be merciful unto me altogether my foot standeth in an even place in the congregation will i bless the lord amen brother troy good morning brothers and sisters okay so uh well we'll attempt to do a song service or uh he asked me last night and so you'll just have to bear with me i was gonna pick out randomly so i wouldn't have to sing so many songs just people to come up and sing specials but there's a lot of people missing so and then my go-to special was going to be woody and michelle but they said that they might not have they might have needed natalie for their special too so we might sing four songs this morning but uh it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning um like brother brad mentioned there's a lot out sick uh with different things and well mostly covet i guess but it's good to be in the house lord the word says where two or three are gathered together they're all being their midst and that's what we're here this morning for we never we never got up out of bed and got dressed and drove very far or uh for nothing we drove here and we're here to hear the word of the lord and to get something from the lord this morning we're in a not so great world right now it's crumbling all around us so so if you'll just uh i guess put forth and and do your best to help me sing because i'm not a singer so so we'll go to uh uh i'll fly away 369 i think is what i got here and i don't know keys or nothing so [Music] so everybody just pitches together and uh maybe it won't be so bad somebody when this is [Music] [Music] hallelujah prison bars [Music] hallelujah now it's just a few more weary days and then [Music] um [Music] hallelujah amen if uh if anybody does have a special one they want to raise their hand right now we can make room for you okay so you just got nominated back there we'll do that thank you very much all right if we'll go up let's see here if we'll go to 155 piece in the valley [Music] start maybe with the course there will be [Music] there will be peace [Music] [Music] [Music] there will be well i'm tired and so weary but i must go along till the lord [Music] is [Applause] there will be peace in the valley for me someday there will be peace in the valley for me lord i pray there'll be no sadness no sorrow no trouble there will be peace peace in the valley for me let's go to the last verse well the bear will be gentle [Music] [Music] chains from this creature that i am oh yes there will be peace peace in the valley for me someday there will be no sadness no sorrow no trouble i'll see there will be peace in the valley for me someday amen that's what we're all striving for is that land just beyond the river i was thinking when i was driving to church here told brother austin in the back a little bit but sometimes you remember those old-time songs that you heard in the church from long ago and i was remembering that song that is his grandpa would always sing and i just love to hear his grandpa sing brother billy and uh that song i want to stroll over heaven with you i love that song but uh if we'll just uh let's see here uh get a couple brother brad and maybe brother austin to come and do the uh offering and like brother brad mentioned there's a lot of people sick i didn't get no reas i guess writ requests but uh brother stephen said his knees bothering real bad brother steven laster said he needs some new cartilage in his knee god's able to do whatever he needs to do to make people feel better uh that may not be what everybody else is you know some people have covered but god's able to be with you and nobody else is able to be with you he's there in the room and he's able to touch you when you need to touch from him my wife wasn't feeling good last night so we'll remember her and then maybe just all the other people that are out with covid and brother bad one let's go maybe brother brad will get a prayer um amen uh let's see here if we go to 309 i come to the garden [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay i come to the garden alone while the jew is still on the road and the voice i hear falling on my ears [Music] he talks [Music] and the joy we [Music] has ever known he speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet the birds they're singing and the melody that he gave to me [Music] [Music] is and he talks with me and he tells me [Applause] as ever ethan and uh caden want to come and we'll sing this last we'll just sing the chorus again and he talks with me and he tells me i am [Music] [Applause] you may be seated sorry [Music] uh there's a river way out yonder beyond the valley across the flames there's a river where i'm going when my savior caused my day no more crying no more weeping no more sadder only day cause on that river [Music] and we will sing sweet hallelujah praises you our glory is king won't you come with us to the river river of happiness thank you right we're going to change the order of the service i guess here and have brother tom come and i really appreciate you all singing this morning uh and i am sorry that i left you standing so long that wasn't i wasn't thinking but uh just pull from the gift that the lord's given us like i said he knows the thoughts and intents of your heart he knows the different ones what they're struggling through and he's here this morning to meet your needs the thing is for our us to get ourselves out of the way and our carnal thinking out of the way so we might accept what he has for us yes so if we'll just uh sing amazing grace this morning as brother tom comes [Music] it's amazing grace [Music] me [Music] [Applause] stand with me [Music] i am [Music] good thing about this now [Music] when we have been there million years right the sun with no last days to sing god's wonderful praise then when we first so we say praise god praise god oh yes lord yes jesus praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god amen and we'll go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on praising god praise the lord god bless you this morning it's good to be in the house the lord how many is feeling good amen if you wouldn't be here you wouldn't be here if you went i guess but amen so praise the lord it's good to feel good and we certainly feel for those who aren't amen and we just pray that god will give everybody a speech recovery this morning amen i'll tell you i thought about the counseling today i know we had a lot out but i said you know we have quite a few people god's blessings with a lot of people and you know to be honest with you i was just looking about four or five of it i didn't know how many he's going to show this morning so amen i don't get a chance to preach a little crowd anymore here god's given us a good group of people amen and so it's not small this morning anymore so praise the lord we're just glad for everybody it does feel good and we certainly each every one of us bind together amen this afternoon when you get home today just continue for each one that is not feeling well amen and we do thank god for those who had it just mildly not really bad but then there's a few of us from an understand you know got really sick and so i'll tell you what it's those week long sicknesses that's really got to be tough you know i you know you know when i work whatever i had a couple months ago i guess you know uh throwing up and so forth and chills and so forth it didn't last but 24 hours and so i was very glad that it didn't last long because and when i was younger i remember those week-long sicknesses and i know one thing those are not fun amen so we certainly feel for everybody that is sick but i didn't i thought well you know i could do it at home we could stream at home and my wife mentioned well you could go down to church and just you know have a few there and and and do streaming there i said well look if i'm gonna go down there and we're gonna have streaming and you know i'm gonna let the people come that's feeling good anyway so i didn't cancel it's just everybody that's feeling good it may count but i want to say again anytime anybody has got a sniffle if you got anything you not feeling good at all stay at home amen you can stream because if it is coveted you don't know for sure if it is i just you know just hold off so that it doesn't get spread amen so praise the lord god will take us through this how many knows that and and so amen we certainly have been really hit hard this last week but amen so we you know because i was hoping and trusting a week a few weeks ago sister that you know it was over with pretty much for here but you know uh the devil's on the rampage amen he certainly like for us to uh try to make us sick but by god's grace we thank him for his goodness so god bless you good morning each and every one of you thank each one that helped out this morning we appreciate it greatly everybody did a wonderful job amen amen and so we appreciate everybody this morning amen i did have a message on my heart and so i just had a scripture that came to me where paul talked about he says you know i came to you not in enticing words of man's wisdom but i came in power and demonstration of the spirit so that your faith would not rest understand in the wisdom of man but in the power of god and so that's what we want to talk about this morning amen so let's bow our heads this morning and just go before the lord we greet everybody of course out there in the streaming world each and every member of evening like tabernacle that is not feeling well that's streaming this morning we'll feel for it god bless you amen and may you get better better soon amen lord jesus we just come before you father knowing lord jesus you are the god that heals all of our sicknesses and all of our diseases lord and if we do get better lord it's because of your miracle because of your grace and we thank you father for each and every one here lord a lot of us already had it a lot of us have went sick got sick and so forth and feeling better and it just makes us appreciate more feeling good and lord would just ask god that you just be with each one out there lord in a special way we believe with all of our heart that you're the same yesterday today and forever and lord when it beats you on your back plumb down to the ribs the bible says that by his stripes we are healed and we believe lord that it was for each and every one of us that our healing was purchased on calvary and we believe your word god despite anything the devil might do we believe that by your stripes we are healed we ask god that you'll bless the meditation of our heart and that which we feel lord you've laid upon our heart to speak this morning we just ask god that you'd help us father truly to get our carnal mind and our carnal thinking and our own abilities out of the way and just to be able to yield to you that you might use this lord to speak father to hearts this morning lord we know that you're the same yesterday today and forever and that you still speak by the spirit to your people and we trust that you'll do that this morning in jesus name amen and amen open your bibles if you will and we'll begin with genesis if that's okay genesis and also first corinthians the second chapter one through five so if you want to pick those two up this morning we'll go for a little while amen now there will not be a wednesday evening service amen and hopefully after this coming wednesday everybody will be aiming into where perhaps one after that we'll be able to continue our wednesday night services too but with it being a little rampant like this we'll just hold off on our midweek service one more time anyway didn't really want to do that but with everything that's going on i think i will and then also uh one more announcement that is uh brother uh brother andrew glover is supposed to be with us next weekend so that's going to be a treat amen brother andrew glover amen so pray for him all right genesis 3 amen how many knows that everything had a beginning and it all started in genesis amen and so we're going to go to genesis and go to chapter 3 and read that just one more time now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but if the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it least ye die the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god does know that in the day you eat thereof your eyes are going to be opened and you'll be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did he and gave also to her husband with her and she did the and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons over in first corinthians if you want to go with that first corinthians the second chapter amen these two scriptures go hand in hand remember that it said that this tree was desired to make one wise so it had to do with wisdom all right so our secrets not secret but our key words this morning is wisdom and faith okay wisdom the wisdom of man or faith in the power of god first corinthians chapter 2 verse 1 and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god now remember that's exactly what the serpent did he was declaring unto eve the testimony of god is that right he said god has said you are not surely going to die all right he was declaring it he was talking about it he had his speech was of wisdom though declaring unto you the testimony of god for i am determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but its demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen wisdom or faith wisdom or faith that's the scripture that came to me that's what i began to think about i felt like the lord laid upon my heart and then i the lord kind of brought in my mind of a scripture and of a sermon that the prophet of god preached amen when he preached a message in 62 called wisdom versus faith wisdom versus faith amen so if you don't mind i'm just going to read a couple quotes of something that he said that i like real well amen to kind of lay a foundation amen praise the lord he says now notice he says that there's two sources that we can draw our life from one of them is wisdom and the other is faith amen remember just as you know because we realize that wisdom comes from also comes from doubt all right it brings down all right now we know that there is a godly wisdom and there is a wisdom that comes from god and there's a wisdom that comes from the devil the wisdom of god always points you to the word of god anything outside of that is the wisdom that comes from satan all right two sources she says one is faith and one is doubt and if we think that wisdom what wisdom produce and then what faith produces but those two sources we're going to talk about them and so forth he says and now notice also something that he said because if y'all remember the lord told brother bantam he says to go back to jeffersonville and so forth and to go back and just store up food how many knows that to store up food let me before i follow i even finish this quote and thought i want to bring that in because he says now what are we doing this morning trying to follow what the lord said lay up food you're going to need it one of these days so lay this food up how many believes that we need eat this food i mean it believes this food that god has stored for us in this end time is actually what's going to carry us through amen it's what's going to sustain us in this time of drought because we know the word of the lord is precious nowadays thus saith the lord is precious nowadays a preacher that really has something that's solid and not just something watered down or some good idea hello that's not what it's supposed to be it's supposed to be the word of the lord is that right amen and we have the word of the lord we have the saith the lord amen i believe that's what this message is what the bible is it's thus saith the lord so it's the food this morning we're going to feed on the food that god has given to us amen way back in the 50s and 60s because we are going to need it and we certainly need it this morning so let's eat amen and then what mama said sit down let's eat that's what we're going to say this morning let's eat praise the lord god bless you it's good to see all of y'all on the front row young folks god bless you amen all right that's the way that's where to be right on the front don't back back there somewhere you know especially in life and then serving the lord say right there serve the lord amen be stay close to him amen they pray the lord i know when i was young i did the same thing and if thoughts have never regretted great big greatest thing you'll ever do is serve the lord jesus christ so now listen now faith and wisdom to begin with we've noticed that in genesis the first chapter when it was in his faith was introduced and wisdom was also introduced i mean the first battle that ever took place took back took place in genesis and truly you and i know that we both realized that that we're in a battle right we're in a battle we're in a constant battle we're in a constant struggle right amen and we're battling the powers of evil amen and the battle of faith or the battle of doubt the battle of reasoning or the battle of uh wisdom and the battle of having faith and amen we're fighting a battle to preserve our life or we're fighting a battle to get behind something that'll protect us from the enemy and from even from death itself amen we want to get a hold of something that will give us joy something that will give us comfort something that'll give us peace because you don't have to live very long and you realize hey there's not a whole lot of peace out there there's not a lot of comfort out there amen as soon as you get the age accountability and so forth and boy i'll tell you what you do things wrong and that begin to build on and build on and the sin heaps up and you get tormented and people will drink and do drugs and get into everything and if you don't look out careful i mean you'll be swallowed up with the corruption that is in the world so we're looking at battling for we're battling for our life we're battling for deliverance to be delivered from the power of the enemy to be delivered from the pas the power of this flesh and the desires of this flesh amen and every that's the greatest battle is found of course there in genesis and i want you to i want you to know that that greatest weapon the devil had back there he is still using and the greatest weapon that god has he is still using and you have to use it this morning amen when blah blah blah preached my greatest about whatever thought he says it's an array amen it's set before us amen and if you just notice that the apostle paul i believe it says that we're to cast down imagination and what reasoning all right so let me let me let me let's talk about this wisdom first all right so now now we find that these two factions these sources one of them is wisdom and the other one faith and they've versed each other amen how many verses to be contrary one to another one versus the other one one fights the other one they're against each other it's either one or the other all right they have versed one another since creation in the garden of eden amen praise the lord now one of the first points that i want to make uh is that wisdom he says let's take wisdom first wisdom has reasoning that's what wisdom has satan's wisdom with eve he said you're going to be wise right but what he what did he do to give her this wisdom he used the instrument the knee and i believe that is the greatest weapon that the devil uses you know just like if you're sick well you know the devil will tell you well you know you you've prayed before you've believed before and you just stayed sick he will point you to a past failure he will use your mind you know and that's how he gets people is by using their mind and using their reasoning ability you know and all of us probably have heard the statement about well you can't reason with that guy there's no reasoning with that person you know in other words you're a barrier there and it just you won't get past there you can't get it in the head can't get through there's no reasoning with some people well the devil wants you to reason with him because remember natalie uh nelly i believe is nellie sanders i believe it was that got saved got baptism in the holy ghost and a day or two later she walked by that dance hall she used to go dancing with and her and her boyfriend and my boy they were just dancing stars and she stopped for a minute and listened for a minute and she said well maybe i can be a witness to them folks it was the devil using her reasoning and before she knew it she was out on the dance floor again amen and then she ran to brother bannon because she was so miserable she knew she had sinned amen and brother bannon began to pray and some wicked evil looking back kind of a devil come up behind or in that right when god brother ben prayed says devil you got to let her go is that right you don't realize that that that spirit that spirit of guilt and that horrible spirit or that feeling that you get sometimes if you uh sin against god that that's a horrible demon actually huh it takes the holy spirit to cast that thing out but she used reasoning the devil used her reasoning so we see the power of wisdom the power of wisdom is to bring reasoning into your mind the only way he'll convey to you his wisdom is through your reasoning now the second part if you remember faith bill bam says has no reasoning huh it has no reasoning it don't reason where would we i really don't know where we would be at and how it would be it's just a big tissue thought this morning where would we be at this morning if eve wouldn't have fell i would have been i don't exactly know the human creation would have never been in a following condition no right god would have never been a savior never been a redeemer never been a deliverer never right he allowed that he allowed leave to fall he knew she would he's not dumb he's not ignorant of anything he knew she would so that he could be a redeemer he could be a savior he could be a deliverer amen so he knew that she would reason now adam how many knows adam didn't reason nah devil he he didn't bother coming over talking to adam did he he probably did maybe he did a time or two but adam says you just get the behind me god has said period huh and he you know resist the devil and he'll flee from you open up your mind to a little reasoning he'll come on in that's what he did with eve that was one of the first things he did was to bring his smarts his wisdom a little more understanding a greater life be smarter huh be smarter is what he tried to tell her that you're going to be smart you're not smart huh god never asked us to be smart over in first corinth against the first chapter remember he says that you know that god calls you know those who are nothing he calls the people that are not great men and so forth you know but this is simple people that's most of the time god who god calls hey you know if you're not smart you know you're not smart i tell folks i'm headed here to tell you you know once you recognize you're not as my person i'm not a smart person i need the lord to guide my mind amen i i gotta you know just about pray about anything anymore and i should just go have god's guidance like service this morning lord what do you want me to do and i felt the holy spirit say hey go ahead and have it amen the love of the devil would love for us not to have it at all that's what he'd like to have he'd love for us not to go to church at all amen but not god god wants us to come together and amen and assemble ourselves together and and praise the lord because you know of all things remember what we're here for this morning we make some of us made a long drive we make that sacrifice and that's for one purpose not because we have to but because we want to worship and praise our god i don't i don't know about you but i don't want ever i don't ever want worshipping the lord and praising god and amen and hallelujah i don't ever want that to get old to me because if it gets old to you here it'll probably get old to you over there remember it got old for the devil over there he got tired of it all he wanted something different that's what a lot of church folks do to come to church you know they come to church for a while but then they want something different they want something new it's not it gets old go ahead and go out there try it you're going to be disappointed this is the best thing that we can possibly do is worship the lord and serve him the rest of our days and all through eternity that's why man we'll sing that song praise god god praise god praise god praise god then we'll sing it some more well praise god praise god praise god and then we're going to sing it some more well i hope you don't get tired of praising god because that's what's going to happen over there amen okay kind of off my thought here but listen praise the lord so we realize that wisdom has reasoning faith don't have any reasoning praise be to god real genuine faith has no reasoning now what does faith do faith puts its complete rest and trust in the power of god in god's word god's word said it that's how it is that settles it do you realize that noah for 120 years would not reason because look at the size of that boat on top of that hill for 120 years if he'd allowed the devil to begin to say talk to him he just says it has never rained one day it's never rain it don't rain he says you know i think this is feudal i don't think this is ever going to rain if he'd one time if he'd have thought and begin to reason he'd acquit he'd quit the job that boat would have been half done huh same way with abraham but god says i'm going to make you a father of many nations isn't that right he didn't reason either he knew god was going to do it no matter how much he failed no matter how much sarah had him to speak with hagar this saturday abraham still knew he believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and that right but when you begin to reason for 120 years noah did not reason with god and god's word and what happened the rain finally came it actually actually finally happened everybody else in town the newspaper of that data media and that right they had him a fool they had him a nut crazy man up on the hill beating away every day do you hear that hammer every day do you hear that song he's up there does it work in a way i never seen somebody go off his head that bad before that he'd build a boat up on top of the hill for 120 years huh noah never came out this pub and says now wait a minute folks i'm not quite sure if god told me to do this huh every time he come out i'm here to tell you folks it is going to rain it is going to flood the earth the only safe place the only place that you'll stay alive is in this here boat huh how many knows in this hour we've had the same thing man not in no church it ain't gonna be be safe anywhere you can won't be able to climb mount everest you won't be able to climb the biggest mountain it ain't gonna be safe no matter what hill you have to climb in no matter what church you belong to what denomination you belong to you ain't gonna be safe anywhere not even at the branham tabernacle you're not going to be safe there's only one place that you're safe and that is in jesus christ the holy ghost praise the lord only place of safety the only place that you're going to be safe from the wrath of almighty god in this generation it's in jesus christ and the devil comes to us he's come to us no doubt he'll come to you and make you wonder well i wonder if i'm gonna make the rapture i wonder if i'll be translated and he'll reason with you and he'll say look at your life look at what you're not what you ought to be huh anybody have problems like that sure but you know down in your soul that faith says i don't care devil i'm i believe i'm gonna be there god did not bring me safe this far just to lead me off here at the end amen you look around and look at the cycle that the prophet of god said every church goes a church age goes through amen right every church age she had a revival and people were on hot and fire for god and praying all night and speaking in tongues and the methodists and the different ones shouted and then they'd have him some of them were called the shakers because they'd fall on the floor and just shake under the power of god and oh my you know they thought when they shook they had it oh mine and after a while they quit shaking after a while well well well hum drum after a while you know they couldn't have barely read their bible anymore and i just fizzed out that right faded out and it was called the cycle of death and man they all kind of just fade away and then we look at the message of the hour and look at the fading away that's happening look at the seal that people are losing look at the enthusiasm people don't have anymore huh then you can say then thomas byler says by the word of the lord and i be believed by the holy spirit look up you can't go much longer or everybody in the message should be dead but there'll be some i mean believe there'll be some that's still got the fire of god in the heart that loves the lord that looked for him to come one of these days i was thinking this morning you know you have about a 50 50 chance of going into rapture 50 50. i thought well maybe that needs a good analysis because the bible says you know two will be one will be taken and when it will be left but you know you don't want to take a chance like that right you want to make sure that if there's two in the bed i'm ready to go i'm the one ready to go amen to be in the field wanna be taken one will be left it's if your heart is right with god or not amen all right let's go a little further amen talking about reasoning the power of reasoning the power of faith now remember this that god paul said here that i didn't come to you with excellency of speech using the wisdom of man and so forth but i come to you in power and demonstration of the holy ghost so that your faith would not rest in the wisdom of man but so that your faith would rest in what come on y'all the power of god the power of god we need amen corner who's going to volunteer that be my amen corner this morning resting in god's power not your power not my power not your ability not my ability but his ability no one ever he never trusted his own ability he could have never brought the rain down he could build the boat but he can't make it rain he knew that god would have to do it and god did it so we're supposed to live and have our faith and hope resting in the power of god in our life okay praise be to god and not to use our reasoning that's i'm going to tell you let me just say this i think this is more intricate and perhaps a little closer to each and every one of us than what we realize and i think every one of us ought to pray lord jesus help me to recognize when the devil is trying to use my reasoning all right reasoning is simply being able to reasons things out and that right being able to hey you know this or figures figure it out the reason animal kingdom don't have that power i mean but we do we can reason out and figure it out and think it out that's what the devil used on eve to try to emit bring it in such a way and bring a thought into her mind that was contrary to the word of god and remember this that satan's ambition according to isaiah the 14th chapter was i will be exalted above the most high i will exalt my throne above the stars of god in other words he's going to have his kingdom is going to be higher than the stars of god right there's the stars in other words he's going to come in and he's going to say now you know paul didn't really know what he was talking about you ain't got to really listen to the bible or what paul said here or any of his messengers had come and brought the word of god he would bring in reasoning and that's what he would use and he would have a word for each and every one of those folks amen that would contradict and anybody listen anybody that goes contrary to god stars god's messengers god's word is absolutely anointed by the devil and as soon as you or i take your reasoning remember this as soon as you take your reasoning over what god said the devil becomes your god and he's the one that you're serving amen just like catholicism we know because our loyalism you know they believe that they could forgive sins and we're going to have a booth over here and i need you to come and confess your sins and then i'm going to say your sins are forgiven you uh they think they have the power to forgive how many knows there's only one that has the power to forgive you many different things like that that they would do amen that they would pervert the word of god peter was their first pope peter wasn't the first pope no and but yet they make that paul and different ones you know and so forth they perverted and satan just let me just say this the wisdom of the devil is 99 true it's almost right and if he ever deceives any of us if he ever gets you to reason it'll be 99 percent right it's that other one percent when he came to eve he had 99 right all but one word just one word he got eve to disbelieve and that is that she shall not surely die amen just that not she thought god didn't mean what he says amen praise the lord all right what does faith do what is the christian principle first of all jesus said one place come unto me all he who are weary and heavy laden is that right and i will give you what rest i will give you rest amen and how do you get this into this rest through faith i wrote down here it's wisdom or faith it's rest or reason rest or reason because reasoning it'll take you away from god ultimately you'll be miserable it won't give you any kind of rest or comfort but real genuine faith in god gives you rest amen i know about you but rest is pretty precious nowadays it's a struggling world we're in a struggling world we're in a sick world we're in a dying world we're in a completely chaotic world but in the middle of all of that aren't you glad that you can actually come to a place that you rest and that rest is in that faith brings you to a rest in the power of god am i believe that you rest in the power of god once your faith is not standing in your wisdom then it's standing in the power of god let's take for example the three hebrew children how many would say did it wait upon the lord shall renew their strength amen they completely could have said man how are we going to get out of this when they were coming towards that fire when they were fixing to be burned amen what did they resident rest in how are we going to get out of this we better figure they didn't figure anything out they went bound hand and foot amen maybe there was chains on their feet maybe their hands were there just enough to be able to walk to go up there to be pushed over the edge into the fire they had faith in god didn't they and it bring a rest to where they did not have to worry about anything they rested in the power of god we this morning stand in the power of god through no matter what you go through i believe that's what the lord's telling us don't try to figure it out just rest in my power how many knows that's the one thing that god tried to get israel to do time after time after time yeah he did in hebrews the third chapter hebrew three and we'll begin with verse 15. while it is said today if you will hear his voice harden out your hearts as in the provocation for someone they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whoms were he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not how many was israel was always relying on their reasoning why moses why did you bring us out here into this trap wasn't there enough graves in egypt always using their mind always thinking with their head how many notes that's what the devil uses is our head always trying to figure it out rather than just resting and standing in the power of god said look they should have said look but we don't understand why god would bring us down here between these big rocks down to this water and we can't even retreat we can't go nowhere we can't turn right left can't go forward and here we hear them coming and moses don't know what to do my lord as we might say have we got ourselves in the pickle and they can begin to what complain the devil begin to use their mind and i want you to know that's what god does for every one of his children and i want to show you by the prophet of god that god is trying to get that out of his people that you don't use your own thinking you only rely on one thing and that is the power of god the word of god they would complain why was he grieved with them why did he swear you're not gonna end his rest because they did not have faith because faith is what actually brings you the power of god and causes you to rest now notice so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief chapter 4 verse 1 let us therefore fear least a promise of being left at least a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it praise the lord it is absolutely amazing how that god can absolutely save a soul change your nature fill you with the holy ghost simply by what you are able to hear it am i right they heard the gospel they heard moses there they hold that but there was no faith mixed in it they didn't believe it and we know you don't just hear or understand with your mind but you hear with your heart and god speaks us not only through the pastor and the preachers but he speaks to you when you're driving down the road when you're listening to a tape when you're reading your bible god speaks to your heart you know right and when you hear that voice don't harden your heart but let it be soft let god tell you what he's trying to tell you israel didn't do that for time after time again now right time and time again they didn't do it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he saith amen as he has said verse 9 of the same chapter chapter 4 says there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he has also ceased from his own works as god did from his praise be to god but makes a statement he says you know i find around most christian lives he says i mostly hate to say this but it's true that most people can that profess to be christians they seem to have such a hard time holding on i believe it's because of a lack of correct teaching of the bible no such a thing as holding on he done the holding on the whole christian principle is based upon the rest come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy lady now i will give you rest praise be to god how many of those three were children even though they were going to the fiery furnace they could have arrests we're not trusting in our masculinity and our power and our strength we're resting in the ability that god has god's ability daniel the same way he didn't rest in his own ability or able to figure it out he rested in the power of god and god come on the scene amen daniel in the lion's den he didn't rest upon his vulnerability israel amen what was it joshua and caleb amen i wonder why you don't hear more hey brother nathan how you doing hey brother cora how you doing you don't hear a lot of dating core names do you nobody wants to name their kid after somebody like that but we hear a lot of davidson joshuas and caleb's isn't that right daniels huh peters pauls amen micas all of these great names because they had faith in god they didn't rely on their ability or their knowledge or their wisdom because caleb and not caleb and yahweh was caleb and joshua and caleb came back from spying out the lands and all those other ten spies that went over there brought back a report no we are not they have walls they have chariot races on top of their walls [Music] ain't no way we're ever going to get defeat defeat that weakness i'll tell you why i had to hide behind a mulberry tree in a big old oak cause man i'll tell you what when them giants come stomping through there it was a scary thing they have giants in the land huh they come back whimpering and crying and moses even cried to the lord one time god here i am he's in god why do you cry to me moses quit your crying you cry baby amen speak the word and go forward joshua and caleb they came back and they had all these grapes and they had to have an audience they had to get up on the pulpit so to speak and the platform says calm down y'all what is wrong with y'all calm down calm down he says we are more than able to take the land why because you're not i'm not releasing on all of y'all short little guys most of israelites and jews a lot of them are short little fellas they aren't big great big people we're not relying on our ability we're relying on the one that brought us safe this far they had a positive god loved them too there were only two originals that went into the promised land because they could believe that they could do it amen that's the way i believe the message of the hour god is bringing brought us a message that amen the bride is going to be ready for the rapture and i believe that that is absolutely the truth there'll be a group of people that have eaten of the good food that god has provided for us in this day it will make them what they're supposed to be it isn't a bunch of hot dogs and a bunch of poison it's some good meat it's some good food that's gonna sustain you gonna get us ready for this rapture don't you believe that and this is one of them this one this is part of the food amen that is that you don't rest on your own abilities you rest in the power of god absolutely no matter what comes life or death you have got to rest in the power of god as you get older your body gets weaker hey man you used to be able to lift 200 pounds 300 pounds now you do good to lift 25 pounds it'll be good did you be able to lift five pound weights after a while maybe three pound weights i mean then you'll get sick you'll get so weak you'll be doing good to be able to raise your arm up in that deathbed you'll be so weak so weak amen and that's when you're going to have to rely on the power of god amen how many believes that as you get older we lose our strength you get weaker all the time amen but what we need is the holy ghost amen that's right you can take all the vitamins you want you can take all the black juice or whatever it is you want to drink you're still going to keep on getting weaker the only thing that i know of that'll really perk you up amen it's the word of god i am el shetty i the breasted one and that right you all remember the story of the pentecostal that came up in the pulpit he was about 80 some years old and couldn't barely get up the steps you know and it had him to come up to preach a little bit he got up there and he talked about the rainbow and so forth and the covenant of almighty god and amen the stars that shot up for joy he jumped up in the air clicked this hill together you ain't got enough room up here for me to preach i'm that quickly power make you alive again the power of god isn't there right you may think you have power but folks i'm telling you all of our power will fail one of these days and we want our our power to be gone now i'm not resting on my power or my ability let me just talk to you about something else and you'll hear this and know this through the prophet's message that the the moabites were relative to abraham is that right there were lots kids and they were moabites and they did the same church they had the same church they had the same preachers they had the same deacons they had the same set up they had the same god they had the same everything but they were carnal everything was by carnality isn't that right only the israelites they were the ones that were spiritual they followed the pillar of fire they had the holy ghost among them everybody else just did it as a ritual and the prophet taught us that it goes on all the way to the end you always have twins you always have those that rely upon their wisdom upon what they do naturally or politically or physically they can do and the others rely upon god there's a church spiritual and there is a church carnal amen the carnal relies on what they can do the spiritual totally relies upon god amen praise the lord scripture says in psalms there is no king saved by a multitude of and hosts a mighty man is not delivered by much strength amen how many know samson when he looked at those big steel gates she knew that he was no match for those steel gates if he'd begin to reason he wouldn't have backed up to him huh he wouldn't have backed up to them gates grabbed the hole a few of them bars and pulled the things right out of the ground and it says he went up and running up on the hill and threw it off he didn't reason about whether he could or not he just did it huh moses didn't rely on his ability his smarts when he went down into egypt and that right in his wisdom to go down there he just said god said let my people go oh my the king of egypt pharaoh he was he is his intellect he looked at all of the hosts and his army and you and what army is coming to set off all these uh these israelites free is that right but even pharaoh after a while wanted to reason with moses he wanted to reason with him he says you know what why don't you the man why don't you just some of y'all go out there in the mountains and so forth and worship your god amen but leave your chill into all of it leave them all here and then come back he tried to reason with him what did moses do he was he was not a reasonable man why because he uh had faith faith don't reason moses said sorry no deal that's what eve should have said no deal devil i don't want any of your fruit i don't want any of your smarts i don't want to get any smarter amen my if you'll read and listen to that hey wisdom versus faith i believe it is there better not say that let me see here where we're at all right no i believe it's perfect strength by perfect weakness i believe where he talks about uh he said look around today at all of our great achievements that we think we've done and where is christianity in the united states look at our churches and our denominations that's what the prophet god said our evangelists and our healing campaigns and everything else we've had what is it it's worse not than it was at the beginning but we can sure say that nowadays can't we amen he could say it back then but look at where it is today my even the letting homosexuals coming on in the women cut their hair wear makeup wear men's clothes every old way you think that's what god's going to take to heaven with i don't think so he demands holiness without holiness no man shall see god amen praise the lord now notice so brother ben makes a statement listen no ability i don't care whose it is will ever be usable in the sight of god as long as you think you can do something you better be careful you better just rely on god you better get on your prayer bones and say god what is it that you want me to do i have nobility of myself god has to get all of our abilities out of us before he can ever achieve his purpose if he's got something for us to do but as long as we feel we can do it then god can never use that that's where he talked about look around look at all the churches look at all those folks trying to do now i want to tell you something there was one man that was surrendered to the will of god in this generation brother branham he was surrendered to almighty god he come up here and he says now you know i can't do nothing i can't tell you who you're from what your name is or i can't help you i'm waiting on him he'd always have to wait on him and when he would come huh it would all be different that's why people would drive 1500 miles 2 000 miles in one weekend people would drive 1500 miles just to get to one service or two and drive all the way back home because they didn't just hear a man talking but they seen the power of god manifested amen the dead dropped over my brother right here i believe was right behind the man that was dropped dead probably god went down and prayed for him and he got back up that's the power of god we don't rest on our ability we're resting on the power that's what i want for my life don't you want that for yours lord that's what i want i want to realize completely the power of god i don't want any ability of us i don't want any of me in god's way amen praise the lord he talked about the long prayers they made catholic and protestant would get together say some prayers he says he says he might as well not done it what it takes is a surrender life to god i mean that's exactly what daniel that's what david that's what what the three hebrew truth that's what they did they were surrendered completely to god that's what god kept trying to get israel to do was to surrender to him because it's not about what we do it's about what god does amen jehoshaphat remember when the armies was coming up again surrounded him and he had no chance he went to prayer and believed in god and he didn't even have to fight the battle god fought the battle for him that's the way it is with us don't you want to see that more of that in your life and say god when i come up against the situation i want to see you handle the battle praise the lord amen i know brother john he's listening this morning he gave me a testimony of how he surrendered something to god and god turned the whole thing around and blessed it said god it's your father maybe sometimes he'll give a testimony of it that's what i like to hear when people surrender their problems and their things to god and see god come on the scene that's what paul was saying look don't rest upon your wisdom or your ability but just rest in the power of almighty god now i believe it's more relevant now than ever don't you that we rest with what we don't know what the future holds the world crumbling hey it's time to rest more on the power of god if we get out of here it won't be because if you're figuring it out it'll be because of the power of god that you trust in that you live by amen all right perfect strength by perfect weakness amen listen what could it do it didn't do any good all of those things look at the condition of the world and it'll never be until every person that professes to be a christian will forget his own ability and yield himself to god you know you really don't know how to run your life how many know you don't really know how to run your life god is the one that is supposed to run your life he's the one that's supposed to work miracles and do the great things that need to be done not you he wants us surrendered to him life or death surrender to almighty god listen never until every person that professes to be a christian amen oh my i truly believe this is the material the bride is going to be made out of that she's not going to rest in anything outside of god in his power not of your own ability what you can do then god can achieve his pur purpose by sending not a revival but brother what he needs to do is send a real killing first amen so that we can revive you have to die before you can be born again let me just say this if you want more of god then you're going to have to die more to yourself how many beliefs there's more of god to be had there's more of god to be had there's more of the holy ghost to be had but you ain't gonna get it one bit not even a little bit until you are willing to die a little more to yourself well brother butler i don't think i'm a pretty good there you go you're a rotten person already if you think you're a pretty good person if you really have much of the holy spirit you realize that you're not what you ought to be huh praise be to god and the holy spirit will show each and every one of us those areas where you can die a little more how many is with me so lord here i am show me that area of my life that i need to die to myself a little more so that you can live so that i can see your power in my life not my power not what i can do but what you can do this church ought to be full of testimonies of metabolism this is what god did for me i trusted him and i asked him for this and this is what god did for me this is this is what we want to hear huh my am i lord help us that's right we need a killing of ourselves the prophet of god said if he said that back then he says this tabernacle he was at the tabernacle this tabernacle needs a killing and me with it hallelujah all of us we need a killing so that we can be revived in new life a new hope a new hold a new experience we need first a day of mourning listen we've got to get away from that that human ability we got to get to a place where we are surrendered our soul our lives even to the housewife the farmer the mechanic or whoever you are we got to surrender completely to god and know that we are nothing and let god start from there remember he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore let's struggle then let's struggle and paddle until we get to this place of rest is that right let us labor therefore enter into that rest at least any man falls after the same example of unbelief how many knows that this listen all right i'm gonna tell you a story here in closing brother bam said that he was reading about paul raider you all remember paul raider the story of him and him i don't remember paul rayder but i remember the story of him he preached divine healing he not only preached it but he practiced it listen he says let me see here he was over in some other country over there doing missionary work and he took some kind of a fever black water fever or yellow fever or something and it rose so high in him until he began to come unconscious and he said to his wife don't leave me stay by my side pray for me and she kept praying and he went into a coma notice and he says that he was unconscious he went unconscious and when he did he dreamed through his back in his woods as a logger again because that's what he used to do cutting timber and he cut a big log his paw said send him up on the hill to cut this log and bring it back and he struck his axe in that soft timber on the evergreen and started to pick it up and he just couldn't pick it up it was just too much for him and he said well why would the boss ask me to cut this log if if i couldn't pick it up and he says if you get a symbol of it god will never give you something that because grace won't give you the power to do that's right he will never promise something in here but but he will fulfill it he's tried to pick it up and he couldn't he says he just wore himself out tugging at it that's what's the matter with the church denominations what they've done they have wore their self out tugging at this and tugging at that trying to do this just turn loose let god do it that's the thing to do listen to this this is very good just let god do it it's too much for you anyhow god's let men run to their limit right now god let men go and have this world he let them prove to themselves that they can't run this world come on folks a amen he has allowed people to get to the place to where they realize they can't run this world amen all the governments they can't run a thing they try dictatorship it don't work nothing works god with his mighty hands shows this world cannot stand that's right god rules the world he will rule it through jesus christ but now man wanted to rule it and you see what chaos he's got it in that's what he's got it in every time that's what he got in before the andalubian destruction and so forth and when the signs were given and that's what he's got that kind of condition before the first coming of christ and you see what happens to sign the pure and it's not a third time that's the last time the ending of all things but anyway he says paul he paul raider again he going back to the story he said he paul said he talked at it he just didn't know what to do he sat down on a tree and started crying oh i can't pick it up i have lost my strength so he heard a voice speak he says and he heard his boss his voice speak with a kind voice and said paul i said what are you struggling at it for why do you not just throw it over in the water cast all your cares upon him for he cares for you amen come unto me all you are weary and heavy laden i will give you rest how many thankful for that rest i'll tell you what aren't you glad that no matter what the future holds no matter what happens you can rest in christ and you can know that you're right with god that you're ready to meet him if he was to take you home before you got home want to rest you don't have to struggle and fight daniel didn't have to fight and struggle he just had to walk got to carry the rest moses he just had to say what god said god took care of the rest am i right no oh my throw it over in the water and the water the water runs right down by the camp so he looked up and his boss was the lord jesus so he just took that big old log and pushed it over in the water jumped the straddle of them and began to splash the water right and right down the river glory how many is riding down this river of time this stream of time and it's not you doing it it's not your power but you're riding on the power garden you're just saying hallelujah glory praise be to god i'm riding on it i'm right i didn't know it how many is riding on it this morning that's right he was hollering i'm riding on it i'm riding on it riding on it and said he was coming right into the camp screaming with all of his boys i'm riding on it when he came to himself he was standing out in the middle of the floor with his hands up in the air screaming i'm riding on it i'm right now it's god's promise he has here he was healed right there in the room and the fever has left him praise the lord may that be every sick person's this morning if you're sick you have a fever whatever it is just begin to write on the word of god by his stripes i am in glory love begin to praise god amen begin to act like you're feeling better and watch healing just come to you claim the word of god that's the only hope we have is the word of god you the holy ghost this morning said here i am lord i surrender all i surrender all lord how many believes without you'll never experience the full power of god until there is a full surrender of your heart and mind and soul to the lord jesus christ nice amen praise be to god how many this morning would search your hearts both here and out there would say there is still more that i can surrender to god there is still more that i can surrender to god and i want to do that this morning if you want to stand to your feet this morning amen let's just stand to our feet and say god here i am let me become a prisoner to you lord it's not about what i can do it's not about relying on reasoning or figuring it out help us never to do that but rest completely on what your bible has said but what your word has said lord that's what we rest on this morning and as we go down through these troublesome waters lord jesus we ain't going to be afraid of what's going to happen we don't have to be afraid of what tomorrow holds because we know the one that holds tomorrow and lord we can say truly in our hearts those of us who have surrendered our hearts see lord we're just riding on it we're just riding on the power of god this morning we're believing that he will raise us up he'll heal us he'll give us strength father we come before you this morning with our heads bowed our hands raised saying lord jesus look down into my heart look into my life lord and i ask myself and show me god where i'm not quite this dead is what i should be where i reason too much where i give the devil a little bit of room and i get robbed of god's blessings because i let the devil talk me out of it lord help us not the reason not to be reasonable when it comes to the word of god god said it i believe it that settles it we don't have any more that we want to hear lord help us to be in that way father and i believe this morning anybody that will really take you at your word and say i believe that by his stripes i am healed and when we begin to praise god and say god praise you anyway no matter what i am going to praise you father i'm going to give you honor i'm going to give you glory lord because you're worthy of praise lord you take us through every place every every dead end we come to lord you raises up lord you have delivered us out of the hand of the enemy lord you have caused us to be able to escape the corruption that is in the world amen by your divine power god according to first peter lord you've changed this lord jesus and you've given us father the spirit of god in our hearts lord as many as believes you your bible has said that they have they were given the power to become the sons of god lord the daughters of god lord we ask god that you fill each and every one this morning with that power that quickening power that thing that just sets a spark in our hearts that sets us on fire for you lord and causes us to love one another to pray for one another and most of all to love you lord and to give our all to you lord lord from the youngest here to the oldest may we re-surrender our lives this morning and say lord jesus here we are surrendering completely even as all those who have experienced and saw your power work we now surrender ourself and watch your power just like joshua did amen a jericho lord it wasn't his power that brought those walls down but it was him simply yielding himself to god god brought the walls down god you'll bring this sickness lord and you'll cast it out of each and every one of us if we'll just seek the kingdom of god and your righteousness first and all these things shall be added unto you lord father we love to sit back and watch your power we love to sit back so to speak and rest in you and watch you fight our battles for us to completely slay the enemy we ask god that you just touch each and every heart and hand this morning bless father the words that have been spoken may they go down in each heart lord and bring forth a hundredfold may this morning lord those who have common both those that are listening lord have a closer walk with you after this morning more surrendered to you lord in every aspect of their life lord reveal and show to us by your holy spirit let the light shine down in our lives and show us all the areas god that we haven't surrendered yet the way we should and help us to repent and to surrender it to you lord for we ask this in jesus name amen and amen praise be to god be positions if you'll come how many loves the lord let's just give him a clap offering say thank you lord jesus
