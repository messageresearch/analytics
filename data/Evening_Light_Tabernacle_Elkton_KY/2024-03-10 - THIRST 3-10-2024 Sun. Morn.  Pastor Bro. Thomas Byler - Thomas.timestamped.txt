[25:19] chapter Paul and Apostle of Jesus Christ
[25:22] by the will of God to the Saints which

[25:28] Christ
[25:34] Jesus blessed be the God and father of

[25:58] to himself according to the good
[26:01] pleasures of his

[26:14] according to the riches of his
[26:22] grace having made made known unto us the
[26:25] mystery of his will according to his
[26:28] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[26:34] [Music]
[26:44] himself we have obtained an inheritance
[26:47] being predestinated according to the
[26:49] purpose of him who worketh all things
[26:52] after the counsel of his own
[26:56] will
[27:01] we'll read this one together in whom ye
[27:04] also trusted after you heard the word of
[27:07] Truth The Gospel of your salvation in
[27:10] whom also after that you believe were
[27:12] sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise
[27:16] brother
[27:25] tro you may be seated
[27:35] good morning brothers and
[27:37] sisters oh drop
[27:41] something usually have a bunch of things
[27:43] written down and and a lot of things
[27:46] tried to put together uh usually when I
[27:49] get up here then it kind of all goes to
[27:51] the wayside it seems like it's kind of
[27:52] hard to keep track of things but uh if
[27:56] you'll go with me to
[28:00] uh 1
[28:03] Samuel chapter 30 we're going to read a
[28:06] a story in here but um it's a story
[28:10] about
[28:14] David
[28:16] um they were out fighting him and his
[28:18] men were out fighting and they just came
[28:20] back to the city of Zig lag it's a story
[28:23] or scripture to us but uh in when iten
[28:27] happed to David and it wasn't a story to
[28:29] David it was a a very trying time for
[28:33] David uh it was a very hard time for
[28:35] David and then it was also very
[28:38] triumphant triumphant time for David so
[28:41] it's uh 1 Samuel chapter
[28:45] 30 and we'll just read through here we
[28:48] might skip a little bit of it maybe for
[28:49] time's sake maybe but starting in verse
[28:52] one and it came to pass when David and
[28:55] his men were come to zigg on the third
[28:58] day that the Mal malachit had invaded
[29:01] the South and zigg and smitten zigg and
[29:05] burn it with fire and had taken the
[29:08] women captive that were there therein
[29:11] they slew not any either great or small
[29:14] but carried them away and went on their
[29:17] way and David and his men came to the
[29:21] city and behold it was burned with fire
[29:23] and their wives and their sons and their
[29:25] daughters were taken captive when David
[29:27] and the people that were with him lifted
[29:30] up their voice and wept until they had
[29:33] no more power to weep so very very low
[29:36] time and David's two wives were taken
[29:40] captive a h Noom and jezus and Abigail
[29:45] the wife of nabal the carlite and Dav
[29:48] distressed for the people spake of
[29:50] stoning him because of the soul of all
[29:53] the people was grieved every man for his
[29:56] every man for his sons and for his
[29:58] daughters but this is a key here but
[30:01] David encouraged himself in the Lord his
[30:03] God and David said to abathar the priest
[30:07] aik's son I pray thee bring me hither
[30:10] the epod and abathar brought hither the
[30:13] ephod to David and David inquired at the
[30:16] Lord saying shall I pursue after this
[30:18] troop shall I overtake
[30:22] them and he answered pursue for Thou
[30:24] shalt surely overtake them and without
[30:26] fail recover all so David got a positive
[30:31] positive thing from the Lord there he
[30:32] said go forth and take take him over so
[30:34] David went he and the 600 men that were
[30:37] with him and came to the brook bizor
[30:40] where those that were left behind stayed
[30:42] but David pursued and he and let's see
[30:46] he and 400 men for 200 AB Boe behind
[30:49] which were so faint they could not go
[30:51] over the
[30:52] brook bore and they found an Egyptian in
[30:56] the field and brought him to David and
[30:59] gave him bread and he he did eat and
[31:01] they made him drink
[31:02] water and they gave him a piece of cake
[31:05] of figs and two clusters of raisins and
[31:07] when he had eaten his Spirit came again
[31:09] to him for he had eaten no bread nor
[31:11] drink any water three days and three
[31:14] nights and David said unto him whom
[31:17] belong us thou and whence art thou and
[31:19] he said I am a young man of Egypt
[31:21] servant to an amalaki and my ma Master
[31:24] left me because three days ago I fell
[31:26] sick
[31:27] that wasn't a very good Master he left
[31:29] him sick with no food and no water so we
[31:33] made an invasion upon the south of the
[31:36] shites and upon the coast which
[31:38] belongeth to Judah and upon the south of
[31:41] Caleb and we burn zigg with fire David
[31:44] said unto him C thou bring me down to
[31:46] this company and he said swear unto me
[31:49] by God that thou will neither kill me
[31:51] nor deliver me into the hands of my
[31:53] master and I'll bring thee down to the
[31:55] company and when he had brought him down
[31:59] behold they were spread upon all the
[32:00] Earth eating and drinking and dancing
[32:03] making all the great spoil that they had
[32:05] taken out of the land of the Philistines
[32:07] and out of the land of
[32:09] Judah and David smote them from the
[32:12] Twilight even until the evening of the
[32:14] next day and there escaped not a man of
[32:17] them save 400 young men which rode upon
[32:19] camels and fled and David recovered all
[32:22] that the amalekites carried away and
[32:24] David rescued his two wives there was
[32:27] nothing lacking to them neither uh small
[32:30] nor great neither Sons nor daughters
[32:32] neither spoil nor anything that they had
[32:35] taken to them David recovered all Lord
[32:39] praise the Lord amen and David took all
[32:41] the flocks and the herds which they
[32:43] drave before those other cattle and said
[32:45] this is David's spoil so not only did he
[32:47] recover everything but he actually got
[32:49] more than then was even his and David
[32:52] came to the 200 men which were so faint
[32:55] that they could not follow David whom
[32:56] they had made also to abide at the ver
[33:00] Bor and they went forth to meet David
[33:02] and to meet the people that were with
[33:03] him and when David came to near to the
[33:06] people he saluted them then answered all
[33:09] the wicked men men of bow of those that
[33:11] went with David and said b or he said
[33:14] because they they said because they went
[33:17] not with us we will not give them ought
[33:19] of the spoil that we have recovered
[33:21] saved every man his wife and his
[33:23] children that they may lead them away
[33:25] and depart then they d you shall not do
[33:27] so my brethren with that which the Lord
[33:30] hath given us who hath preserved us and
[33:32] delivered the company that came against
[33:34] us into our hand David had a real
[33:37] revelation of who was the one fighting
[33:39] for him which was God who is the one who
[33:40] gave him the stuff in the first place
[33:43] for who will hearken unto you in this
[33:45] matter but as his part is that goeth
[33:48] down to the battle so shall his part be
[33:50] that terth by the stuff they shall part
[33:53] alike and it was so from that day
[33:56] forward
[33:57] that he made it a statute and ordinance
[33:59] for Israel unto this day when David came
[34:01] to zigg he sent of the spoil unto the
[34:05] Elders of Judah even to his friends
[34:06] saying Behold a present for you of the
[34:08] spoil of the enemies of the Lord and it
[34:10] goes to say that he divided upon these
[34:13] different tribes and stuff but uh that
[34:17] story to me it says you know
[34:20] there's there's uh a lot of things in
[34:23] that story it's a breakdown of the
[34:25] hardship that David went through
[34:27] it's a breakdown of what David or what
[34:29] we do during a time of hardship we
[34:31] encourage oursel in the Lord we search
[34:33] for an answer from the Lord and then
[34:34] when we have an answer from the Lord we
[34:36] go forward uh it it also is a a story of
[34:41] great Triumph but what
[34:43] I like about it and kind of what what
[34:46] was gearing my thoughts towards it was
[34:49] don't uh don't ever give up to the enemy
[34:52] and don't ever give in the enemy
[34:54] basically don't ever give up and uh
[34:58] there's lots of other uh places in the
[35:00] scripture if I can keep my head on here
[35:02] and we'll look at these different just a
[35:05] few different ones just encouraging um
[35:08] scriptures but many stories in the Bible
[35:11] of
[35:12] shamgar uh how they had taken his stuff
[35:14] so many years but you know there was one
[35:16] year then he that was the that was the
[35:18] end of them taking his stuff he said
[35:20] that's that's it he can't do it no more
[35:22] so he fought for what he had his
[35:23] god-given rights were and he killed all
[35:26] those
[35:27] Philistines um let me see here we if
[35:31] we'll
[35:34] go see here if we go to Luke I might
[35:38] have this
[35:40] one talking Luke
[35:43] 181 where's Jesus talking about the
[35:46] unjust judge let me see if I can find it
[35:55] here
[36:03] Luke
[36:04] 181 this is Jesus and he spake a parable
[36:07] unto the them to this end that man ought
[36:09] to always to pray and not to faint
[36:12] saying there was in a city a judge which
[36:15] feared not God neither regarded man and
[36:17] there was a widow in that City and she
[36:19] came unto him saying avenge me at my
[36:22] adversary and he would not for a while
[36:24] but afterward he said within himself
[36:26] though I fear not God nor regard man yet
[36:29] because this Widow troubleth me I will
[36:31] avenge her Le by her continually coming
[36:35] she weary me and the Lord said hear what
[36:37] the unjust judge saith and shall not God
[36:41] avenge his own elect which cry day and
[36:44] night unto him though he bear long with
[36:46] them I tell you that he will avenge them
[36:48] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[36:50] man cometh shall he find faith on the
[36:52] earth and then if we'll go you can go
[36:56] with to me with me too uh if you want to
[36:59] it's up to you but let's see here that
[37:02] was uh let's see Matthew
[37:08] 15 I think it's
[37:17] 21 and this is of the cph cian
[37:25] woman yes 21 Jesus went then and
[37:28] departed unto the coast tyn Sid and and
[37:31] behold a woman of Canaan came out of the
[37:33] same coast and Cried unto him
[37:35] saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son
[37:38] of David my daughter is griev grievously
[37:41] vexed with a devil but he
[37:43] answered not a word and his disciples
[37:46] came and besought him saying send her
[37:48] away for she crith after us but he
[37:51] answered and said I am not sent but unto
[37:53] the lost sheep of the House of Israel
[37:56] then then came she and worshiped him
[37:59] saying Lord help me she said but he
[38:02] answered and saidit is not meat to take
[38:04] the children spread and cast it to the
[38:06] dogs and she said truth Lord yet the
[38:09] dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from
[38:11] the master's
[38:12] table then Jesus answered and said unto
[38:14] her oh woman great is thy faith be it
[38:17] unto thee even as thou Wilt and her
[38:20] daughter was made whole from that very
[38:25] hour she uh uh not giving up and not
[38:30] giving in to what the devil may say
[38:32] there's many other stories of the woman
[38:34] think about the woman that washed jesus'
[38:36] feet there would have been many options
[38:38] in her mind I'm sure to get out and try
[38:40] to get away from that uh being that you
[38:43] know the devil probably was telling her
[38:45] well you're not you're not worthy to go
[38:47] in there those you're all the different
[38:49] things that might come you know the the
[38:52] heckling from the people and so forth
[38:54] but she pursued and went through through
[38:56] with what she had set in her heart to do
[38:58] which was to wash Jesus's
[39:00] feet um if we'll
[39:03] go let's see First Corinthians I think
[39:25] nine
[39:27] 1 Corinthians
[39:38] 9:24 Paul says talking about running a
[39:41] race know you not that they which run in
[39:44] a race run all but one receiveth the
[39:47] prize so run that ye may obtain and
[39:49] every man that strive for the Mastery is
[39:51] temperate in all
[39:53] things now they do it to obtain a corrup
[39:56] corruptible Crown but we an
[39:58] Incorruptible I therefore so run not as
[40:02] an uncertainty so fight I not as one
[40:05] that beateth the air but I keep under my
[40:08] body and bring into subjection lest that
[40:10] by any means which I have preached to
[40:12] others I myself should be a
[40:15] Castaway talking about running the race
[40:18] and never giving up uh there's I'm going
[40:20] to finish here let's see I think I got
[40:24] a well I had a quote here
[40:28] so brother Bram saying this is my angel
[40:31] should go before
[40:32] me brother bam saidh says this off often
[40:36] where he says a winner never quits and a
[40:38] quitter never
[40:40] wins uh let's see but we not not but we
[40:44] not we who we who are in contact with
[40:47] the spiritual realm of God well I was
[40:49] prayed for talking about receiving your
[40:52] healing what you need to do when you're
[40:54] prayed for and so on and so on well I
[40:55] was prayed for and I didn't get my
[40:57] didn't get me healed so I guess there's
[41:00] nothing to it he says oh what a poor
[41:03] Crow bait you make for God see look no
[41:05] sir God wants somebody who will not give
[41:08] up a winner never quits and a quitter
[41:10] never wins you've got to stay and call
[41:13] it call things right before Satan tell
[41:17] him it's this away thus sayeth the Lord
[41:20] the Lord has said so and that it is
[41:21] written it's written no matter what he
[41:23] says it's written right here well
[41:26] brother he goes on to say a lot of times
[41:29] this is what the devil says and this is
[41:30] where we have a issues or I have issues
[41:33] I don't know you guys might be going
[41:35] sailing smooth through it but the devil
[41:39] always tries to put it back on ourselves
[41:41] well you can't well you can't well it's
[41:43] not for you well it happened for them
[41:45] but it can't happen for you because
[41:48] because it has not much to do with us it
[41:51] has to do with the word of the Lord and
[41:54] if we can encourage yourself in the word
[41:57] like David did back at zigg he went and
[41:59] encouraged himself in the Lord if we can
[42:01] go back and encourage ourself in the
[42:03] word because it doesn't have with we
[42:06] always look for these different things
[42:08] to touch or this or so on and so
[42:10] on it's really going back to the word
[42:13] sticking with the word and that's where
[42:15] we have our confidence from and that's
[42:17] where we can continue and say well now
[42:19] because of the word I can't give up in
[42:22] myself I could give up but because what
[42:25] I'm standing on is a sure Foundation I
[42:28] can't give up if I was standing on our
[42:30] own if we're standing on our own
[42:31] Foundation or something that we did I'd
[42:33] already gave up a long time ago but
[42:38] because we're not standing on our own
[42:40] Foundation or something that we've
[42:42] created or something that we've made up
[42:44] we're standing on the word of the Lord
[42:47] which is never changing so brother renom
[42:51] goes on to say and it just Contin but we
[42:54] uh okay let me see here he says well
[42:57] brother Brenham never got to touch
[43:00] me brother Brenham never got to touch me
[43:02] he said it is written brother Bren never
[43:04] got he he goes on to say it is written
[43:07] brother Brenham never done no healing
[43:09] God done your healing it's already did
[43:12] it's written whatever I ask and believe
[43:15] God I shall receive it it's mine my
[43:18] personal property and if we can just
[43:20] stick with that and he goes on to talk
[43:22] about Edison you know how people push
[43:24] through when said somebody said well
[43:26] that's not possible there's not no
[43:28] possible to have electricity well here
[43:30] today we enjoy electricity because a man
[43:32] named Thomas Edison sat and pushed
[43:34] through and push through and push
[43:36] through when everybody said that's not
[43:37] possible but he believed it was possible
[43:40] and here we sit this morning enjoying
[43:43] enjoying what he said was possible so if
[43:45] we just stick with the word stay on the
[43:47] word and basically the the moral of the
[43:50] story to me was just never give up
[43:52] always always believe God always
[43:54] continue if you got breath in your
[43:57] body keep quoting those scriptures and
[44:00] going back to the word of God brother

[1:26:52] Amen in St John
[1:26:56] 1 and we'll just read uh quite a few
[1:27:00] scriptures here kind of to just to get
[1:27:03] our foundation so to
[1:27:06] speak St John four did I say one St John
[1:27:12] 4 when therefore the Lord knew how that
[1:27:15] the Pharisees had heard that Jesus uh
[1:27:18] made and
[1:27:20] baptized uh more disciples and John
[1:27:23] though Jesus himself baptized not but
[1:27:25] his disciples he left Judea and be
[1:27:28] departed again into galile for he NE
[1:27:32] must needs go through Samaria amen
[1:27:36] praise the Lord amen what a sermon right
[1:27:40] there ain't that right God when the Lord
[1:27:43] Jesus Christ was walking on the shores
[1:27:45] of Galilee and so forth in Samaria he
[1:27:47] had needs to go a certain direction amen
[1:27:50] how many knows that Jesus was led by the
[1:27:52] spirit amen and then uh then cometh he
[1:27:56] to a city of of Samaria which is called
[1:27:59] Saar amen near to the parcel of ground
[1:28:03] that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now
[1:28:06] Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore
[1:28:08] being wearied with his journey sat thus
[1:28:11] on the well and it was about the sixth
[1:28:14] hour then cometh a woman of Samaria to
[1:28:16] draw water and Jesus saith unto her give
[1:28:19] me it give me to
[1:28:21] drink
[1:28:23] for his disciples were gone away unto
[1:28:25] the city to buy meat then says the woman
[1:28:28] of Samaria unto him how is it that thou
[1:28:31] being a Jew askest drink of me which am
[1:28:33] a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no
[1:28:37] dealings with the Samaritans and Jesus
[1:28:40] answered and said unto
[1:28:42] her if thou knewest the gift of God and
[1:28:45] who it is that saith unto the give me a
[1:28:47] drink I would have asked him ask of him
[1:28:51] and he would have have given thee Living
[1:28:53] Water Amen to woman saith unto him sir
[1:28:57] thou has nothing to draw with and the
[1:28:58] well is deep from when then hast thou
[1:29:02] that Living Water art thou greater than
[1:29:05] our uh father Jacob which gave us the
[1:29:08] well and drank thereof himself and his
[1:29:11] children and his cattle I mean as when I
[1:29:14] read that I thought he could have
[1:29:16] replied uh yeah I kind of made Jacob and
[1:29:19] all of his children and the well
[1:29:23] how many knows that's right without
[1:29:25] Jesus Christ there was not anything made
[1:29:27] that was made the Bible said amen that's
[1:29:31] right he was certainly greater wasn't he
[1:29:32] and Jesus answers and said unto her
[1:29:34] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:29:37] thirst again but whosoever drinketh of
[1:29:39] the water that I shall give him shall
[1:29:42] never
[1:29:43] thirst how many can say Amen to
[1:29:45] that amen but the water that I shall
[1:29:48] give him shall be in him a well of water
[1:29:50] springing up into everlasting life the
[1:29:53] woman saith unto him sir give me this
[1:29:56] water amen that I thirst not neither
[1:29:58] come hither to draw and Jesus said unto
[1:30:01] her go call thy husband and come hither
[1:30:04] the woman said unto answerers and said I
[1:30:06] have no husband and he says unto her
[1:30:09] thou has well said I have no husband for
[1:30:12] thou H has had five husbands and whom he
[1:30:15] whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in
[1:30:18] that s thou truly the woman saith un him
[1:30:22] I perceive that thou art a prophet our
[1:30:25] fathers worshiped in this mountain and
[1:30:26] ye say that in Jerusalem is the place
[1:30:29] where men ought to worship Jesus saith
[1:30:31] unto Heroman believe me the hour cometh
[1:30:34] when you shall neither in this mountain
[1:30:36] nor at Jerusalem worship the father amen
[1:30:40] how many's glad to worship God amen amen
[1:30:44] wherever you are you can worship God why
[1:30:47] because he says he got to worship Him in
[1:30:49] spirit and in truth amen but the hour
[1:30:52] cometh and now is when the true
[1:30:54] worshippers shall worship the father in
[1:30:56] spirit and in truth how many knows it's
[1:30:59] not all just about Spirit but it's
[1:31:01] worshiping him in spirit and in
[1:31:05] truth amen if we're going to worship him
[1:31:07] we got to have something to worship him
[1:31:09] about and his word is what gives us that
[1:31:13] amen worshiping ability God is his
[1:31:15] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:31:16] worship Him in spirit and in truth the
[1:31:19] woman saith unto him I know that the
[1:31:20] Messiah cometh which is called Christ
[1:31:23] when he is come he will tell us all
[1:31:26] these things Jesus said unto her and I
[1:31:29] you verely ever hear Jesus saying this
[1:31:32] to people amen but he says it to her I
[1:31:35] that speak unto thee am
[1:31:39] he
[1:31:41] amen amen oh my I don't know about you
[1:31:45] but H you talk about a gulp of
[1:31:48] water you talk about a drink that
[1:31:53] satisfies amen those scribes the
[1:31:56] Pharisees they call Jesus be
[1:31:58] elub called him chief of devils but this
[1:32:01] woman he was told that hey he is the
[1:32:04] Messiah no longer did she ever have to
[1:32:06] wonder whether he was again or not
[1:32:09] amen and upon this came his disciples
[1:32:12] and marveled that he talked with the
[1:32:14] woman yet no man said what see seekest
[1:32:16] thou or why talkest thou with her how
[1:32:19] many knows he was there by herself by
[1:32:21] himself with a woman of ill Fame amen
[1:32:25] but he had need to go by
[1:32:26] Samaria didn't Jesus say all that the
[1:32:29] father has given me will come and I will
[1:32:33] lose not a
[1:32:35] one amen this preacher standing up here
[1:32:38] does not have to worry about whether God
[1:32:39] is going to get all his children God is
[1:32:42] going to get his
[1:32:43] children he's going to see to it I don't
[1:32:46] care what he's got to do amen amen then
[1:32:50] the woman left her water pot went under
[1:32:52] the way into the City and says unto the
[1:32:54] men come see a man which showed me all
[1:32:57] things that I ever did is this not the
[1:32:59] Christ then they they went out of the
[1:33:02] city and came unto him amen we God add
[1:33:04] His blessings to the reading of the word
[1:33:06] you can be seated this
[1:33:09] morning but we're going to talk about
[1:33:11] thirst this morning is that okay let's
[1:33:14] talk about thirst amen praise the Lord
[1:33:18] hallelujah this woman was thirsty now
[1:33:21] notice how that after he uh how many
[1:33:24] believe that he actually gave her that
[1:33:26] drink he gave her that drink that
[1:33:29] satisfied amen amen and so we realize
[1:33:34] that all of humanity how many beles that
[1:33:36] all of humanity God has left in their
[1:33:39] heart a little place of void there's a
[1:33:43] thirst in all of humanity first of all
[1:33:45] amen but you know and we want to talk
[1:33:48] about it with a little with the help of
[1:33:49] the Lord a little how that lot of people
[1:33:51] try to satisfy that thirst that God put
[1:33:54] in you amen one of the first things that
[1:33:58] uh we would think about it is in the
[1:34:00] world in the world order and and and
[1:34:02] even the uh Io Io or something like this
[1:34:06] this new drug that came out you know how
[1:34:09] that it's an epidemic and how people are
[1:34:12] overdosing and so forth and just trying
[1:34:15] to get a little piece of mind because
[1:34:17] they're thirsty because we as humans
[1:34:19] know that we're more than
[1:34:23] animals people know people know in their
[1:34:26] heart that there is a God they might try
[1:34:28] to deny and covered up but they know
[1:34:31] that they're going to come to
[1:34:32] judgment how many beli everybody has to
[1:34:35] come to
[1:34:36] judgment so it creates a thirst for
[1:34:39] satisfy that to quench that to have that
[1:34:41] question
[1:34:42] answered
[1:34:44] amen praise the
[1:34:47] Lord amen let me uh before we go much
[1:34:51] further on our thought I want to read
[1:34:52] another scripture come back in Book of
[1:34:54] Revelations 22 Amen in verse uh verse 17
[1:34:59] it says you know the and the spirit and
[1:35:02] the bride say come and let him that
[1:35:06] heareth say everybody amen say come and
[1:35:10] he let him that is a thirst come and
[1:35:13] whosoever will let him take of the Water
[1:35:17] of Life
[1:35:19] freely amen I believe that even that
[1:35:22] word will is a form of
[1:35:26] thirst amen because when uh uh uh it's
[1:35:30] something that you desire or you want
[1:35:33] you will you I want to come I want to
[1:35:36] get a drink it's a thirst it's a longing
[1:35:40] it's a
[1:35:42] passion Amen in our tables what what is
[1:35:45] you that you spread out your food and
[1:35:47] yeah basically have your food and your
[1:35:49] water and that is basically the
[1:35:51] substance of life amen is food and water
[1:35:55] and Jesus said blessed are they which
[1:35:57] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:36:01] for they shall be filled before there
[1:36:03] was a fin on a fish's back there had to
[1:36:06] be water for him to swim in and then
[1:36:09] before there was a a a a a wing on a
[1:36:12] bird there had to be air for him to fly
[1:36:16] with and me before there was a call of a
[1:36:19] elk amen that would make the
[1:36:23] woo and then before he would have there
[1:36:25] would be a cow somewhere that can
[1:36:28] understand the call of that
[1:36:31] elk is that
[1:36:33] right amen Jesus said my sheep hear my
[1:36:37] voice they know my voice and a
[1:36:40] stranger's voice they will not follow
[1:36:42] amen a real son and daughter of God Amen
[1:36:45] when they hear that true voice there's
[1:36:47] just something about that voice they
[1:36:49] just know that's right
[1:36:53] oh aren't you glad oh I'm oh my think
[1:36:56] about it all that the father has come
[1:36:58] given me will come to me and I won't
[1:37:01] lose a one of
[1:37:04] them
[1:37:09] amen fish are made to swim did you ever
[1:37:12] try to catch one with your hand did you
[1:37:15] ever try to swim after
[1:37:18] one why they leave you so far behind
[1:37:21] they'd be picking on your little
[1:37:24] toes
[1:37:26] huh ever see the oh my the fish how they
[1:37:29] can just swim through that
[1:37:31] water why they've got that why people
[1:37:34] can't see God in nature I don't
[1:37:37] know all these little sounds and all
[1:37:39] these instincts and all these instincts
[1:37:42] that God put in the animal kingdom and
[1:37:44] so forth and and the sounds of the birds
[1:37:46] and the different ones and you don't
[1:37:48] understand it and we don't understand a
[1:37:50] lot of what they're saying saying and so
[1:37:51] forth me but when a h goes
[1:37:55] wo me you don't understand what in the
[1:37:57] world they're saying but there will be
[1:37:58] one way down on the other end of the
[1:38:00] woods go
[1:38:02] back the craziest bunch of sounds of the
[1:38:05] human being but they understand but
[1:38:07] they're
[1:38:07] saying
[1:38:10] glory
[1:38:12] amen let me tell you something it's
[1:38:16] something when a child is away from God
[1:38:20] when a child of God is away from God
[1:38:22] it's like a fish out of
[1:38:24] water that
[1:38:26] right and they can't use their F but
[1:38:29] what did they do whenever you land that
[1:38:30] fish
[1:38:34] they ain't that
[1:38:36] right that's right you go to diving
[1:38:39] after him because if that bank just has
[1:38:41] a little curve in it brother Glenn just
[1:38:43] a little curve is all that little fish
[1:38:45] needs he's been given an instinct flop
[1:38:47] flop flop amen it ain't no time and he's
[1:38:50] going to be back back in the water and
[1:38:51] if he gets in the water he's gone that's
[1:38:54] the way a child of God is Man we might
[1:38:56] flop from here flop from there but let
[1:38:58] me get into the word of God and I'm
[1:39:00] telling you I know how to
[1:39:02] swim amen a child of God when you get
[1:39:05] saved you know how to worship God you
[1:39:07] know how to give him praise and honor
[1:39:09] and

[1:39:47] more they're happy where they
[1:39:50] are
[1:39:58] amen see folks I'm not
[1:40:00] happy until I get back to the Garden of

[1:46:08] religions is that

[1:46:18] of a certain menite a certain h or that
[1:46:21] came out of that one and that one came
[1:46:22] out of that one you know and they're
[1:46:24] this brand they're that brand and this
[1:46:26] brand and that
[1:46:28] brand
[1:46:29] huh this woman no doubt but she was
[1:46:33] confused I looked up at word Saar and it
[1:46:35] was a place of confusion and so forth
[1:46:39] the meaning of was a place of
[1:46:41] confusion Jesus comes into the place of
[1:46:44] confusion people living in the
[1:46:46] are of
[1:46:49] confusion and desolate and so forth and
[1:46:51] gives them Clarity this woman had no
[1:46:53] more
[1:46:55] question and yet Christ could come and
[1:46:57] do the very same thing in our generation
[1:47:00] discern the thoughts and Tents of the
[1:47:01] heart world over never fail thousands of
[1:47:04] times and people will fail to recognize
[1:47:06] that that's the Messiah that's Jesus
[1:47:14] Christ aren't you glad that you can have
[1:47:16] peace of mind you don't have to wonder
[1:47:20] whether what you believe is the truth or
[1:47:22] not there's no doubt there is no
[1:47:28] question
[1:47:31] amen aren't you glad that I don't have
[1:47:34] to come up here and give you my idea of
[1:47:37] it I don't have to listen to your
[1:47:39] stinking idea of
[1:47:41] it because I'm here to tell you if God
[1:47:43] wouldn't have sent Malachi 4 took his
[1:47:47] own
[1:47:49] picture the form a pillar of
[1:47:51] fire when when uh Dr best was there and
[1:47:54] he was putting his finger and he was he
[1:47:56] was going to put it in the papers that
[1:47:58] you know I really reproved this Propet
[1:48:00] and I ought to be the one to drive him
[1:48:01] out of town took a bunch of pictures and
[1:48:03] that's the only one that was developed
[1:48:05] went to JJ Lacy the head of the FBI and
[1:48:07] so forth and they documented and
[1:48:09] searched it out and said the only real
[1:48:11] absolute authentic picture of a
[1:48:14] supernatural being ever taken God took
[1:48:16] it
[1:48:18] amen amen
[1:48:21] thousands of times he would do that sign
[1:48:23] of the Messiah Jesus would come on the
[1:48:25] platform and he would you know do
[1:48:27] exactly like he did when he was walking
[1:48:30] on the shores of Galilee so why so I
[1:48:32] wouldn't have to worry about my own idea
[1:48:34] we wouldn't have to in the world of
[1:48:36] confusion but the Bible calls it mystery

[1:48:41] Abominations of the Earth let me tell

[1:51:56] down in the whole earth was lightened
[1:51:58] with his glory how many can say but
[1:52:00] about in his ministry Jesus Christ went
[1:52:03] over
[1:52:04] the seven
[1:52:07] times he faced Mohammad as Buddha
[1:52:09] 500,000 challenge him Jesus Christ to

[1:52:45] right but they rejected that light
[1:52:48] having great power amen and the Earth
[1:52:51] was lightened with his
[1:52:54] glory and he cried mightily with a
[1:52:57] strong voice saying Babylon the great is
[1:52:59] Fallen is fallen and become the
[1:53:02] habitation of devils and the hold of
[1:53:04] every foul Spirit and the cage of every
[1:53:07] unclean and hateful Bird that's what

[1:58:13] that's the truth too isn't it all these
[1:58:16] different voices that's out there you

[1:58:20] praise the
[1:58:23] Lord turn with me if you want
[1:58:25] to let's go to Jeremiah the first
[1:58:28] chapter Jeremiah
[1:58:31] 1 praise the
[1:58:37] lord we want to look at something that a
[1:58:40] lot of us are familiar with but it want
[1:58:42] to take it back to the scripture
[1:58:44] Jeremiah 1 I'm sorry not one again but
[1:58:47] Jeremiah 2
[1:58:49] and verse
[1:58:52] 12 be
[1:58:55] astonished oh ye Heavens at this and be
[1:58:59] hor horribly
[1:59:01] afraid and be very desolate sayith the
[1:59:04] Lord for my people have committed two
[1:59:06] evils they have forsaken me the Fountain
[1:59:11] of Living
[1:59:13] Waters and heed them out ssts broken
[1:59:17] ssts that can hold
[1:59:19] no
[1:59:21] water
[1:59:24] Amen brother BR explains this describes
[1:59:27] it I like it because I know what he's
[1:59:29] talking about I was raised at
[1:59:31] Amish and we would have this great big
[1:59:34] barn now our water came a little
[1:59:36] different but a regular sister they get
[1:59:39] the rain water off of the barn ain't
[1:59:41] that right we'd have cows everywhere
[1:59:43] amen it would get hot in the summertime
[1:59:45] the wind would blow and they would stomp
[1:59:48] around in all kinds of manure and that
[1:59:49] dust from all of that to get up in them
[1:59:51] on on top of the roof and everything and
[1:59:53] the rains that come down and they have
[1:59:55] some kind of a rag is that right they
[1:59:58] have some kind of rag before it goes
[2:00:00] into the SST so that it'll catch some of
[2:00:02] the bugs but it might catch some big
[2:00:04] stuff but I mean know it'll never catch
[2:00:07] the
[2:00:11] juices I'm here to tell you there's
[2:00:13] people that love to dip their Cup in
[2:00:15] there saying oh you should just love the
[2:00:18] what you drink you should be happy with
[2:00:21] it huh no not a real believer I can't
[2:00:26] imagine drinking that stuff but people
[2:00:27] would rather do that because why they
[2:00:29] can still do their own
[2:00:31] thing they can have their own way and
[2:00:35] people love that people like to have
[2:00:36] their own way that's why man I'm telling
[2:00:40] you what whatever you're thirsting for
[2:00:43] there's a church out there that'll meet
[2:00:44] your thirst you want to wear shorts
[2:00:47] bikinis you want to wear makeup and
[2:00:49] pants and all that other
[2:00:51] stuff they're out there for
[2:00:54] you that right every Church they have
[2:00:57] their own filter whatever that you know
[2:00:59] the filter is as long as you come
[2:01:00] through that filter you're
[2:01:02] fine
