[38:24] we pray you'll just speak to our hearts
[38:26] Lord this evening for we ask it in Jesus
[38:28] name amen if you have your Bibles
[38:30] tonight we're going to look back again
[38:33] at habac 2 and verse two we're going to
[38:36] pick back up kind of where we left off
[38:38] on wednes or Sunday actually I want to
[38:41] speak to you on living in the hour of
[38:43] fulfillment I made mention to that to
[38:45] you on Sunday I actually preached part
[38:47] three tonight we're going to look at
[38:48] part
[38:51] one you glad to be in the house of the
[38:53] Lord yeah okay good not bad for a
[38:56] Wednesday night
[38:58] amen so we're going to we're going to
[38:59] look here as you turn there just also
[39:01] want to bring greetings from brother Tim
[39:03] Timothy brother Aaron made it home today
[39:06] he's taking the service
[39:07] tonight so tonight we're going to look
[39:09] at something for you older people I'm
[39:11] not not picking on you because you got
[39:12] gray hair and no
[39:15] hair ah yeah come on it's okay to laugh
[39:17] on a Wednesday night uh but tonight will
[39:20] be a refresher for many of us older ones
[39:22] who's been established in the message
[39:25] but I believe it's going to help our
[39:26] young people to gain a foundation of why
[39:30] we believe what we believe and so we're
[39:32] going to look at this tonight living in
[39:34] the hour of fulfillment and so just uh
[39:38] just let's just take this to the Lord
[39:39] and ask him to bless it so habac 2 and
[39:42] verse two and the Lord answered me and
[39:43] said write the vision and make it plain
[39:45] upon the tables that he may run that
[39:48] readeth it for the vision is yet for an
[39:50] appointed time but at the end it shall
[39:53] speak and not lie though it Terry wait
[39:55] for it because it will surely come
[39:58] it will not t God bless you you can have
[40:00] your seats this
[40:03] evening we look at this word here run
[40:06] and many times we think this means to be
[40:09] physical to get out and you know jog or
[40:11] do something of that nature and to exert
[40:13] some sign of energy but the word run
[40:15] here means to announce the divine
[40:18] revelation so what we're finding here in
[40:20] habca the Lord answered him and said I
[40:23] want you to write the vision and I want
[40:25] you to make it plain so who he that runs
[40:29] or he that's going to announce it going
[40:32] to make the announcement that he's going
[40:34] that anybody that he announces to can
[40:37] read it or understand it and so we find
[40:40] though also here in Jeremiah 23 and 21
[40:44] if you look at this it says I have not
[40:47] sent these prophets yet they ran they
[40:50] begin to
[40:52] announce so what are they announcing
[40:54] they're announcing the vision and we
[40:55] spoke earlier we'll kind of get get back
[40:57] into this again tonight but yet they ran
[41:00] I have not spoken to them yet they
[41:02] prophesied so we understand there's one
[41:05] thing to for God to call you and to give
[41:08] you an understanding and you run with it
[41:10] it's another thing to want to do
[41:12] something from God and you running
[41:13] without a vision and so we find habc is
[41:16] bringing his sin and he's telling if
[41:19] God's going to give a vision and those
[41:20] are going to run with it those that are
[41:22] going to announce it then make it plain
[41:24] so there's no no confusion about it and
[41:27] so we find here also I want to kind of
[41:29] briefly touch on this habc 117 his
[41:33] question to God is shall they therefore
[41:36] empty their net and not spare continue
[41:38] to slay other nations you know he's
[41:40] looking back and he's seeing the Chans
[41:43] ravish this nation pillage and plunder
[41:45] and take it back and go back out pillage
[41:48] and plunder another nation and he's
[41:50] asking God how long are you going to
[41:52] permit this to take place and so when
[41:54] the Lord responds to habac he doesn't
[41:57] respond to him like I'm talking to you
[41:59] tonight but he gives him a vision
[42:02] because I want you to know the vision
[42:04] wasn't only for habac but it's for every
[42:07] generation following that Vision
[42:09] everyone he's therefore write the vision
[42:12] make it plain don't make it cryptic you
[42:14] want it plane so everybody that sees it
[42:18] understands it and those that are called
[42:20] to run with it the ministry that's been
[42:22] called to run with it they're not
[42:24] running without the vision they're not
[42:25] running without clarity but it's been
[42:27] made known it's been made plain and they
[42:30] had the divine revelation of what you
[42:32] have need of in that hour for That
[42:35] season so we want to look at this again
[42:38] tonight Vision what is a vision brother
[42:40] Joe a vision is a prophecy a Divine
[42:43] communication that is a dream a
[42:45] revelation or an oracle now you young
[42:47] people this is directed to you tonight
[42:49] so I'm going to ask you to get with me
[42:50] I'm going to ask you to take notes if
[42:52] you got paper pen whatever you need to
[42:54] be taking notes of this because this is
[42:56] going to help you it's help you
[42:57] understand why we believe what we
[43:01] believe all right why do we believe what
[43:05] we believe we don't believe it because
[43:07] some man said it we believe it because
[43:09] we can take it back to the Bible and
[43:12] we're going to take it back to the word
[43:13] tonight so you young people out there in
[43:16] school out there in the jobs out there
[43:18] on the streets you don't have to be
[43:20] shine away why you believe that God sent
[43:23] a prophet why you believe that we follow
[43:25] the voice of the god in this last day
[43:28] you can have the foundation because it
[43:30] comes back to the word of God everything
[43:33] that we stand for it's right here in
[43:36] this word every Doctrine we believe it's
[43:38] right here in this word and the prophet
[43:41] of God that God s in this hour we can
[43:43] find it right here in the word of God
[43:46] you don't have to be ashamed of saying I
[43:48] believe that God sent a prophet in this
[43:51] end time because the Bible declares it's
[43:53] going to send
[43:55] one now I'm going to go down and teach
[43:57] and not preach but I want you to
[43:59] understand it's emphatic that you young
[44:01] people get this understanding cuz I know
[44:04] when I first came to the message you
[44:06] know you just hear well God sent a
[44:08] prophet but I didn't tell nobody because
[44:11] I didn't I didn't know what in the world
[44:12] they were talking
[44:14] about but as you grow and mature and you
[44:17] learn and you you developed you kind of
[44:20] get that basis so I want to help I know
[44:22] you're good you're well taught here I'm
[44:23] not trying to come in and say that
[44:26] you're not taught well but it's a
[44:29] refresher
[44:30] okay it's a refresher so a vision Divine
[44:34] communication dream Revelation or an
[44:37] Oracle and in Proverbs 29 and verse
[44:41] 18 I don't see nobody
[44:43] writing y'all got your little phones you
[44:45] can do it all on your phone now right so
[44:47] Proverbs 29:18 the Bible says where
[44:51] there is no vision the people perish so
[44:55] initially when we think about that
[44:57] brother bad we hear this word perish
[44:59] automatically we think well they're
[45:00] going to die right is that what you
[45:02] think but that's not what it
[45:04] means that's why we got to go back to
[45:06] the word so what it means here this word
[45:09] perish it means to be let loose to be
[45:11] loosened of rest strength to make naked
[45:15] to set at not to perish to refuse to
[45:18] uncover now let's jump over to
[45:20] Revelations
[45:22] 3 let me show you some things Revelation
[45:25] 3:15 we find here now Jesus speaking to
[45:28] the leoan church our
[45:31] age this generation he says I Know Thy
[45:35] Works Thou Art neither cold nor
[45:38] hot I would that thou were cold or hot
[45:41] so then because thou are
[45:44] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[45:46] spew thee out of my mouth because thou
[45:49] sath notice what they're saying of
[45:52] themselves thou sayest I am rich I am
[45:56] increased with Goods I have need of
[45:58] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[46:01] wretched miserable poor blind and
[46:07] naked where there is no vision the
[46:11] people become naked now not naked as far
[46:15] as undressed but naked as in they have
[46:17] no restraint they're loosened here so
[46:19] otherwise we find that we're living in a
[46:22] day where the people are perishing
[46:24] they're void of restraint people are set
[46:26] at not against the word of God you try
[46:28] to tell them what the word says they say
[46:30] well my church doesn't say that but the
[46:32] word says it but my church doesn't say
[46:34] that well you either going to take what
[46:36] the church says or you're going to take
[46:37] what the word says and for me I find it
[46:40] in the word I'm going to stay with what
[46:42] the word
[46:44] says but they're they're they're they're
[46:46] set it not against what the word of God
[46:49] says and we find people but you find
[46:52] them they're rich they're prospering
[46:53] they're
[46:54] successful oh they're rich in
[46:56] worldliness but they're naked in the
[46:57] things of God they have nothing on
[47:01] nothing you can tell them about I
[47:03] remember when I first became a Christian
[47:04] and I was in a Baptist Church and you
[47:07] know I had a bunch of friends and hey we
[47:09] went we partied on Saturday night went
[47:10] to a church on
[47:12] Sunday I didn't know any better till I
[47:14] grew in the Lord but you know they the
[47:17] the famous Baptist slogan is once saved
[47:20] always
[47:21] saved you know what and I told this
[47:23] young friend of mine and she had been a
[47:26] Christian a lot longer than and I had
[47:27] and she grew up a Christian I didn't and
[47:29] I said how in the world can you say that
[47:31] doing the things that you're doing he
[47:33] goes cuz that's what the church says
[47:35] they said once saved always say well I
[47:36] believe if you're truly saved then
[47:39] there's got to be something happen on
[47:40] the inside of your life that shows that
[47:42] you're truly saved and then once you're
[47:45] saved you are truly saved but you can't
[47:47] tell me you're going out partying on
[47:49] Friday night bar hopping on Saturday
[47:51] night going to the house of God for a
[47:53] couple hours or or or maybe an hour on
[47:56] Sunday morning and you're telling me you
[47:58] living like the devil through the week
[47:59] and all of a sudden you some Saint some
[48:01] some terrible Sunday you ain't saved you
[48:04] need to repent and be filled with the
[48:06] Holy
[48:09] Ghost look I didn't have any knowledge
[48:11] of God then I have any knowledge of the
[48:13] message but I knew what she had I didn't
[48:16] want I knew that if I was going to get
[48:18] saved if I was going to give my heart to
[48:20] God my let me tell you I didn't want to
[48:22] go back to the bar I didn't want to keep
[48:24] living the same way I lived I didn't
[48:26] want to keep uh partying and doing the
[48:28] same thing that I done I wanted
[48:29] something different therefore when I
[48:31] gave my heart to God I didn't take it
[48:33] back the next day I said God I give it
[48:35] to you you keep
[48:37] it that's what it means to be saved
[48:40] that's what it means to be born again
[48:42] but we find the church in the condition
[48:45] I'm
[48:46] rich I'm increased with good I go to the
[48:48] biggest church and you know my dad so
[48:51] and so and my mom so and so but where
[48:53] are you at with God
[48:57] where there is no Divine Oracle where
[48:59] there is no vision the people
[49:04] perish they lose self-control they don't
[49:07] care they're happy going to church on
[49:09] Sunday and living like a dirty dog on
[49:14] Monday come on
[49:18] church and notice here in Revelations
[49:20] 3:20 notice who's at the door knocking
[49:24] behold I Jesus is speaking can hear in
[49:27] my Bible it's read letter i stand at the
[49:29] door and knock and if any man hear my
[49:31] voice and open the door I will come into
[49:33] him and I will s with him and he with me
[49:35] he has been put out of his own church
[49:38] knocking trying to get back in because
[49:41] why there is no vision or the people
[49:44] will not hear the vision for the age
[49:46] that they're living in and because of
[49:49] this they become uh uh distraught they
[49:52] become said it not they become notice
[49:55] they become loosened of a they have
[49:57] become
[49:59] naked and in Amos 3 we understand this
[50:03] at least we must Amos God does nothing
[50:07] but what he first reveal it to his
[50:09] servants the
[50:11] prophets Amos 3 and: 7 surely the lord
[50:15] god notice we're taking everything we
[50:16] believe back to the Bible so surely the
[50:19] Lord God will do nothing now I know
[50:24] you're in Kentucky and I just come from
[50:25] a place and then people didn't have all
[50:27] their
[50:28] teeth I tell you what I ran out of
[50:31] Walmart as quick as I ran into Walmart
[50:33] thought I was in a hillbilly
[50:36] Hil but here nothing means nothing
[50:39] whether in your Louisiana or whether
[50:41] you're in
[50:42] Kentucky come on John look at me and
[50:45] smile nothing means nothing yeah so the
[50:48] absolutely nothing he says surely the
[50:50] Lord God will do
[50:53] nothing he's not going to do one thing
[50:56] but he revealed his secret unto his
[51:00] servants the prophet so God has a way of
[51:03] speaking right God has a method of
[51:06] speaking and the Bible clearly tells us
[51:10] how he
[51:11] speaks and when God does it he does it
[51:14] through a
[51:15] prophet all right so notice when God
[51:18] what did he do to the Egyptians before
[51:20] any plagues came he sent
[51:23] Moses he didn't just send Moses down
[51:26] there Moses had a message and he went to
[51:29] the house of pharaoh first and said let
[51:31] my people go if you don't let them go
[51:34] then this this this and this is going to
[51:36] happen but God had a way of doing it
[51:39] also the ammonites and the
[51:56] by
[51:57] Christ so neither will God bring the
[52:00] destruction of our day the end time
[52:03] without having first sent a prophet he
[52:07] must send a prophet to do what to warn
[52:10] the
[52:11] people always to warn the People Get
[52:15] Ready Get Ready Get ready quit listening
[52:20] to whatever you're listening to and get
[52:23] ready excuse me and follow the voice of
[52:27] the Lord notice before there can be an
[52:28] end time before the Lord can return God
[52:32] has to send a prophet
[52:35] messenger he sent a prophet messenger
[52:37] before his first coming we're going to
[52:40] go there let's go there right now we'll
[52:42] do that Ma Malachi 3 and verse one so we
[52:45] can understand everything we believe is
[52:47] in the
[52:49] Bible Malachi 3 and verse1 says behold I
[52:53] will send my messenger and he shall thou
[52:56] prepare the way before
[52:58] me so God is speaking through a prophet
[53:01] saying before I come physically I'm
[53:04] going to send a prophet and he's going
[53:06] to make preparation for my
[53:09] coming and we understand that this was
[53:12] fulfilled by John the
[53:13] Baptist all right everybody with me
[53:16] least nod your head I know it's
[53:18] Wednesday night and then we go to ma uh
[53:20] Matthew 11 now here we find in in
[53:24] Malachi 3 verse1 God speaking saying I'm
[53:27] going to send my messenger before my
[53:30] coming then Jesus picks up on it in
[53:32] Malachi 7 or Malachi 11: 7 and as they
[53:36] departed Jesus began to say to the
[53:38] multitude concerning John what went you
[53:40] out to the Wilderness to see was it a re
[53:43] shaking With the
[53:44] Wind he says but what when out you to
[53:47] see a man clothed in soft ramond behold
[53:50] they are the ones that are in King's
[53:51] houses but what went you out to see a
[53:53] prophet yeah I say more than than a
[53:57] prophet so why was he more than a
[53:59] prophet because he was the Forerunner of
[54:02] Jesus
[54:03] Christ not that he was any better than
[54:06] any other Prophet not that he did any
[54:07] Supernatural Miracles that we know of
[54:09] John was alone he lived in the
[54:11] wilderness he ate uh Locust and honey
[54:13] and things of that nature but he
[54:16] announced the first coming of Our Lord
[54:19] so he was more than just a prophet he
[54:22] was a prophet messenger he was
[54:25] announcing this great coming he was
[54:28] preparing the
[54:30] way for the one to come so John
[54:33] fulfilled the scriptures regarding his
[54:35] coming let's look in Luke 3 and verse1
[54:39] 15 everybody happy tonight yeah I smile
[54:43] a little bit it's all right I won't be
[54:46] too long tonight last time I did it took
[54:48] four hours just kidding just kidding we
[54:53] get a chuckle out of them then right
[54:55] Luke 3 and verse1 15 this is John
[54:57] speaking and as the people were in
[54:59] expectation and all men mused in their
[55:02] hearts of John whether he were Christ or
[55:05] I notice they were wondering about John
[55:08] because his ministry so mirrored that of
[55:12] Jesus and any God called man's Ministry
[55:15] should mirror that because it should be
[55:17] the very same life but notice what John
[55:19] says here in luk in Luke 3:16 and John
[55:23] answered saying unto them all I indeed
[55:25] baptize you at water
[55:27] but one mightier than I cometh the
[55:30] latchet of his shoes I am not worthy to
[55:32] un loose he shall baptize you with the
[55:34] Holy Ghost and with fire so we find John
[55:39] now he's a prophet messenger and notice
[55:42] everybody was looking to him are you
[55:44] Christ are you the one that we've been
[55:46] expecting to come and he says no I'm not
[55:48] the one but there's one coming after me
[55:51] notice he didn't point the people to
[55:53] himself he didn't Point them to his
[55:55] church he didn't Point them to his
[55:57] ministry he pointed them to Jesus Christ
[56:01] and every God called man every son
[56:04] that's been called to preach this gospel
[56:07] will point you to Jesus Christ if he's
[56:09] pointing you somewhere else I say run
[56:11] from that man run from that Ministry run
[56:13] from that
[56:15] church let to point you to Jesus Christ
[56:18] and he is the word made flesh
[56:22] today so we find in Malachi 3 also in
[56:25] verse 6
[56:26] you can go there we're going to learn
[56:28] something here tonight by the scripture
[56:29] God doesn't
[56:32] change you change some of you used to be
[56:39] young some of you some of us used to
[56:41] have
[56:42] hair amen there we go get it brother
[56:46] Joe we change people change churches
[56:50] changed Society has changed but God
[56:55] never changed
[56:57] what he was yesterday he is the same
[57:00] today and what he is today he will be
[57:03] the same tomorrow you don't cherry-pick
[57:05] God and one day you reaching in and he's
[57:07] something one day that he's not the next
[57:09] he is the very same thing that he always
[57:12] was or he wasn't that to begin with so
[57:16] we find here in Malachi 3: 6 he says for
[57:19] I am the Lord I change not all right
[57:23] that's it enough said case over it is
[57:26] not worthy to be disputed if either
[57:29] that's God's word or it's not God's
[57:32] word so God doesn't change therefore he
[57:35] must keep the same pattern he will send
[57:39] another Forerunner if he sent John to
[57:42] forrun his first coming and who's
[57:44] expecting the second
[57:46] coming not all of you well praise I need
[57:49] to turn this entire subject around and
[57:51] start preaching on
[57:53] repentance if we're expecting the second
[57:55] coming of the Lord and he doesn't change
[57:58] and he sent a prophet Messenger to
[58:00] announce his first coming then he must
[58:02] send a prophet Messenger to announce his
[58:05] second
[58:06] coming do you believe that tonight
[58:09] that's what we believe and this is the
[58:11] scriptures that support this God doesn't
[58:14] change what he did he does who he was he
[58:18] is I say praise God tonight we can put
[58:21] our faith on that that God never changes
[58:27] we can have confidence in the scriptures
[58:29] let me tell you theologians may twist
[58:31] this up one day they may say it says
[58:33] this and another time what denomination
[58:36] background it may be they may say it
[58:38] translates to this but God is his own
[58:40] interpreter and he never changes the
[58:45] interpretation so we jump to Malachi 4
[58:48] let's go there Malachi 4 and verse
[58:51] one you have to excuse my excitement I
[58:53] love the Lord and I love this
[58:57] word he says now Malachi 4 this is
[59:00] what's going to distinguish Malachi 3
[59:02] from Malachi 4 distinguish John from the
[59:06] end time Prophet says for behold the day
[59:09] cometh not here yet but it's coming that
[59:12] shall burn as an oven now look you got
[59:15] to be blind deaf and dumb if you don't
[59:17] what that's referring
[59:19] to he's not going to destroy the world
[59:22] with
[59:23] water it's going to be fire it's going
[59:26] to be nuclear
[59:27] destruction so we find here the day
[59:30] cometh th sh burn as an oven and all the
[59:33] proud yay all that do wickedly shall be
[59:36] stubbled that word stubbled there is
[59:38] chaff and chaff is just you know very
[59:40] lightless of of the wheat then they they
[59:43] they they do whatever they do to it I
[59:45] mean you Farmers y'all probably know
[59:46] what you do to your wheat around here
[59:48] but it can be lit up real quickly and
[59:50] combustible just like that he said it's
[59:52] going to be stubble and that day that
[59:54] cometh shall burn them up sayith the
[59:56] Lord of host that it shall Le them
[59:58] neither root nor Branch so this was not
[1:00:02] the first coming because there's not had
[1:00:04] this day yet therefore it must refer to
[1:00:08] the second coming which we're preparing
[1:00:11] for okay is that okay but unto you that
[1:00:15] fear my name shall the son of
[1:00:17] righteousness arise with healing in his
[1:00:19] wings and you shall go forth and grow up
[1:00:21] as calvs of the stall and you shall
[1:00:23] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[1:00:25] ases under so your feet in the day that
[1:00:27] I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts
[1:00:28] remember the law of Moses my servant
[1:00:31] which I commanded him in horor for all
[1:00:32] of Israel with his statutes notice in
[1:00:35] verse five now this is our scriptures
[1:00:37] right Malachi 45 and 6 we we hang on
[1:00:40] this and we hang on this and if we don't
[1:00:42] know nothing else in the message we know
[1:00:43] Malachi 45 and 6 behold I send you
[1:00:47] Elijah the prophet but if we read it so
[1:00:49] quick all we catches Elijah the
[1:00:53] Prophet come on Church
[1:00:57] behold I send
[1:01:03] you I send you Elijah the
[1:01:07] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:01:09] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[1:01:12] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[1:01:14] the children and the Heart of the
[1:01:15] children to the fathers lest I come and
[1:01:18] smite the Earth with the curse see God
[1:01:20] didn't send Elijah the prophet just to
[1:01:22] send him hoping that he would have a
[1:01:24] following but he sent him for a purpose
[1:01:29] he sent him to prepare the people for
[1:01:32] his second coming come on but many of us
[1:01:36] not us but many around the message had
[1:01:38] made the Malachi 45 and six all about
[1:01:45] Elijah now we got to find a true balance
[1:01:48] with that we do not discredit the Elijah
[1:01:51] cuz without the Elijah we don't have a
[1:01:53] messenger that prepares us for the
[1:01:55] second coming but recognize who he was
[1:01:58] sent to God speaking behold I send
[1:02:03] you so the purpose of sending Elijah is
[1:02:07] for you tonight the purpose of sending
[1:02:10] of Elijah is so that your hearts could
[1:02:12] be turned back to the faith of the
[1:02:15] fathers this entire message everything
[1:02:18] that we believe has been about you
[1:02:21] tonight that's why he sent a prophet
[1:02:24] that's why he's coming again he ain't
[1:02:26] just coming to take one man he's coming
[1:02:28] to take a
[1:02:29] people and you are that people oh I say
[1:02:33] hallelujah tonight and it's backed up by
[1:02:36] the
[1:02:38] word you can find it in the
[1:02:41] scriptures see you are the
[1:02:44] purpose of the
[1:02:47] message
[1:02:49] behold I God send you the bride
[1:02:56] my Prophet my second
[1:03:01] Forerunner oh that's beautiful
[1:03:02] scriptures to
[1:03:04] me and notice this Elijah like the first
[1:03:09] Elijah he didn't Point people to
[1:03:13] himself but he pointed people to
[1:03:17] Christ he could have had a million
[1:03:19] dollars several times tore the checks up
[1:03:21] because it wasn't about preaching for
[1:03:22] money he could show Joe Olin and of
[1:03:25] these other ones a thing or two
[1:03:27] preaching for Prosperity but what about
[1:03:29] preaching for results what about
[1:03:31] preaching to turn the hearts because see
[1:03:33] that was God's gift to turn your heart
[1:03:37] that's why you couldn't go with
[1:03:38] mainstream that's why you couldn't be
[1:03:40] out there and just Flo around and
[1:03:42] continue to live the same life you live
[1:03:44] because on the inside of your heart God
[1:03:46] deposited a seed and at the right time
[1:03:49] that Prophet Messi's word came across
[1:03:52] that seat and it begin to come to life
[1:03:55] on
[1:03:56] for the purpose of turning your heart
[1:03:59] back to
[1:04:01] him now in the church age we find this
[1:04:04] brother B will tell us immediately after
[1:04:06] the coming of this Elijah the Earth will
[1:04:08] be cleansed by fire and the wicked burn
[1:04:10] to ashes of course this did not happen
[1:04:13] at the time of John the Elijah for for
[1:04:16] his day the spirit of God that
[1:04:18] prophesied of the coming of the
[1:04:19] messenger in Malachi 3 was John John was
[1:04:23] just reiterating his previous prophetic
[1:04:25] statement of Isaiah 40 and ver3 he was
[1:04:28] the voice of the one crying in the
[1:04:30] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:04:33] Lord that's what John did so we can see
[1:04:36] from these scriptures that the prophet
[1:04:38] of Malachi 3 was John was not the
[1:04:41] prophet of Malachi 4 two independently
[1:04:44] distinct
[1:04:45] prophets both with the great message to
[1:04:48] forerun the coming of the
[1:04:50] Lord therefore if God thought it was
[1:04:53] essential Thomas to send us a prophet to
[1:04:57] turn us to prepare us for the Lord
[1:05:00] shouldn't we at least listen to The
[1:05:02] Prophet shouldn't we quit trying to
[1:05:04] cherry-pick our quotes and cherry-pick
[1:05:07] our scriptures and oh we're going to do
[1:05:08] this and make this fit and this one I
[1:05:10] don't care about you know that may be
[1:05:12] just his idea but if God thought so much
[1:05:15] to send you a prophet to turn your heart
[1:05:17] then it behooves us to listen to what he
[1:05:22] said it's more than just signs and
[1:05:25] wonders
[1:05:26] it's more than just healing and
[1:05:28] Supernatural the healing and the
[1:05:30] supernatural doesn't turn your heart the
[1:05:32] word is what turns your
[1:05:34] heart the signs and wonders just catches
[1:05:37] your
[1:05:38] attention so now this messenger of
[1:05:41] Malachi 4 they asked a question now this
[1:05:44] messenger Malachi 4 brother R brings
[1:05:46] this out in the church age and
[1:05:48] Revelations 10 is going to do two things
[1:05:51] write this down you probably already
[1:05:53] know it but if you
[1:05:54] don't you you're going to get it tonight
[1:05:56] one according to Malachi 4 he will turn
[1:05:59] the hearts of the children to the
[1:06:01] fathers two he will reveal the mysteries
[1:06:04] of the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[1:06:06] which are the revelations contained in
[1:06:08] the Seven Seals and it will be these
[1:06:11] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:06:13] literally turned the hearts of the
[1:06:15] children to the Pentecostal
[1:06:17] fathers so the revealing of the seals is
[1:06:20] what actually turns your
[1:06:23] heart come on that's where you say Amen
[1:06:26] the revealing of these seals is what
[1:06:29] actually turns your heart and you
[1:06:30] realize he ain't just some
[1:06:33] preacher but he's a messenger a
[1:06:35] prophetic messenger god is sent to do
[1:06:38] what to turn our hearts back you got
[1:06:42] Ministry out there on TV Land and
[1:06:45] Ministry out there in radio land what
[1:06:47] are they doing they're probing at
[1:06:48] Revelations 10 they're probing at these
[1:06:50] things and probing at it and probing at
[1:06:52] it and probing at it let me tell you the
[1:06:55] days are probing are over for the prde
[1:06:57] we've received the message we've
[1:07:00] received the ministry what the days are
[1:07:03] probing over the seals have been loosed
[1:07:05] off the back of the book and it's the
[1:07:07] revelation of those seals that have
[1:07:10] turned our hearts back to the faith of
[1:07:12] the original Pentecostal fathers let me
[1:07:15] tell you I'm not looking for another
[1:07:16] church home I'm not looking for another
[1:07:18] denomination I'm not looking for
[1:07:20] anything else I found what I came for
[1:07:22] and that's turn back to that same
[1:07:24] original p Pentecostal faith in the word
[1:07:27] of
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:29] God now I believe that we can say
[1:07:31] Malachi 4 has been fulfilled we're
[1:07:33] speaking about living in the hour of
[1:07:36] fulfillment so he's he has come and he's
[1:07:39] performed the word that was a lot of for
[1:07:41] him to fulfill and we're here today

[1:08:59] God's
[1:09:00] kingdom let God do the work don't trying
[1:09:03] to fasten yourself after somebody else
[1:09:05] that you're never going to measure up
[1:09:07] to whether that be boy or
[1:09:12] girl I used to tell people I I look I
[1:09:15] was fat and happy back when I was a
[1:09:18] teenager why you
[1:09:22] laugh I was 220 lbs you know what I know
[1:09:25] what I look like you can't hide 220 FBS
[1:09:29] stacked in 5'5 5' 6 it shows brother
[1:09:34] John you think I let it bother me
[1:09:36] absolutely not I strutted my stuff all
[1:09:39] of
[1:09:40] it I was happy in
[1:09:43] myself you say well why' you lose weight
[1:09:45] cuz I wasn't
[1:09:48] dumb but I didn't try to be something
[1:09:50] that I was I knew I was fat chunky short
[1:09:53] tell everybody you know what I may not
[1:09:55] be tall darkg and handsome but I'm short
[1:09:56] Stumpy and
[1:09:58] cute it's all right to be short Stumpy
[1:10:01] and cute not everybody could be Andrew
[1:10:03] Glover tall dark and
[1:10:06] handsome but we fine let's get back to
[1:10:09] the scriptures here let's look here in
[1:10:11] Hebrews 1 and verse one we're going to
[1:10:13] see how God talks to us is this okay
[1:10:17] tonight I didn't know I was going to be
[1:10:18] here but we're here brother Thomas
[1:10:21] persuaded me I like you know what he's a
[1:10:23] faithful Pastor he needs a break so just
[1:10:26] stay one extra
[1:10:27] day and give him a break let him sit
[1:10:30] back and enjoy and just Feast do some
[1:10:33] things that we enjoy we've had a great
[1:10:34] time fellowshipping with brother Thomas
[1:10:35] and brother Tommy woo we're going to do
[1:10:38] it again in December Lord
[1:10:39] willing okay maybe y'all didn't know
[1:10:42] that but Hebrews 1 and verse one god
[1:10:45] notice who's who it is God not man who
[1:10:48] at Su dry times and in diverse manners
[1:10:51] spake in times past unto the father's
[1:10:56] by
[1:10:58] theologians no not theologians by
[1:11:02] prophets and he's God and I don't change
[1:11:06] so if this is the way God does things
[1:11:08] it's the way God will always do things
[1:11:11] because God doesn't change his
[1:11:13] pattern so God in sundri times that
[1:11:17] means old times now that's ain't 1960 so
[1:11:19] don't think it's that old this is old
[1:11:22] times so we find divver maners he wrote
[1:11:25] the Bible by the prophets he wrote the
[1:11:28] Bible by notice his own chosen
[1:11:32] way so God didn't need me God didn't
[1:11:35] need you God didn't need the greatest
[1:11:37] ministers as that we have around the
[1:11:39] land today to tell them how to write the
[1:11:41] Bible he chose it and wrote it the way
[1:11:43] he wanted it
[1:11:45] written so he wrote the Bible by his own
[1:11:47] chosen way he didn't have to write it
[1:11:49] that way neither did he had to save Man
[1:11:51] by Blood he didn't have to preach the
[1:11:53] gospel by man he could have let the son
[1:11:54] of moon and stars preach the gospel he
[1:11:56] could have let the winds hum the gospel
[1:11:59] but he chose man he chose the way his
[1:12:02] word came and that was by His prophets
[1:12:05] which were predestinated and for
[1:12:07] ordained being part of God's word
[1:12:09] declaring the revelation of his word to
[1:12:11] the age and to that time for the word of
[1:12:14] God came to the prophets
[1:12:17] only the word of God came to the
[1:12:20] prophets
[1:12:23] only never does it come to a theologian
[1:12:26] it only comes to prophets God can out
[1:12:28] lie how many can say Amen to that we
[1:12:30] will find I have a scripture here we're
[1:12:32] going to get to that's going to back
[1:12:33] that up the word of God over a hundred
[1:12:35] times in the Old Testament the prophets
[1:12:38] speaking the Lord came to me or the word
[1:12:40] of the Lord came to me see it always
[1:12:43] comes to a prophet that's God's order
[1:12:46] that's God's pattern that's God's plan
[1:12:49] so then notice now so it comes to the
[1:12:51] prophet and the Believers of that
[1:12:54] Prophet they watch for the Fulfillment
[1:12:56] of it of what their Prophet said as
[1:13:00] identification that he is truly a
[1:13:02] god--all prophet because if it do
[1:13:05] doesn't come to pass then he is not a
[1:13:07] god--all prophet he is a
[1:13:10] liar and if he's a liar then you get
[1:13:12] away from the man no different than the
[1:13:14] man standing behind this desk tonight
[1:13:17] Sunday or whenever you have if he's up
[1:13:19] here preaching fallacy and false
[1:13:21] teaching and false Doctrine and lies and
[1:13:23] prophesying it doesn't come to pass you
[1:13:25] need to drag that man to this Altar and
[1:13:27] tell him to get that lion Spirit off of
[1:13:30] him but we watch believers they watch
[1:13:33] for the Fulfillment of what he says to
[1:13:35] make sure it comes to pass so brother B
[1:13:38] would tell us now the church what the
[1:13:40] church was at Pentecost is the
[1:13:44] standard that is the pattern there is no
[1:13:48] other pattern no matter what the
[1:13:50] scholars say God has not changed that
[1:13:52] pattern what God did at Pentecost has to
[1:13:55] keep on doing until the church age
[1:13:58] closes now second Peter 1 and verse
[1:14:02] 21 I know you're a W for that scripture
[1:14:05] so here we go for the prophecy came not
[1:14:07] in Old Time by the will of man but holy
[1:14:10] men of God spake as they were moved by
[1:14:12] the Holy
[1:14:14] Ghost so God has a
[1:14:18] method so there's no reason to be
[1:14:20] ashamed of God's method there's no
[1:14:23] reason to be
[1:14:27] embarrassed because we claim and we
[1:14:29] believe that God sent us a prophet in
[1:14:31] this day because we can back it up
[1:14:35] scripturally so Pentecost is the pattern
[1:14:37] see you can't change the pattern church
[1:14:41] we can't change the pattern to fit our
[1:14:42] ideas we can't change the pattern to fit
[1:14:45] our personalities and our makeups and
[1:14:47] you know I don't like this so I'm going
[1:14:49] to take this part out no we have to fit
[1:14:51] ourself to fit the pattern
[1:14:55] notice Elisha could not put on Elijah's
[1:14:58] robe until he matured enough so the robe
[1:15:00] would fit him now he could have had a
[1:15:02] seamstress kind of cut it here cut it
[1:15:04] there and sew it back up here and sew it
[1:15:06] back up there and fit but it wasn't the
[1:15:08] original we don't want some
[1:15:10] second-handed roow we want the original
[1:15:13] we want that double portion poured back
[1:15:16] on us therefore we must mature to fit
[1:15:19] the word and not cut the word to fit us
[1:15:25] now full obedience to the word will
[1:15:28] entitle you to the Token life it
[1:15:31] entitles you to the Holy Ghost full
[1:15:33] obedience that means you come in line to
[1:15:36] the word and you find well well you know
[1:15:38] here we find things today people will
[1:15:40] say well brother bandam never mentioned
[1:15:42] that or brother bham never discussed
[1:15:44] that well maybe that wasn't a thing at
[1:15:46] that time but notice if you look at the
[1:15:48] world and the trend of the world and you
[1:15:50] can see the fads of the world and if
[1:15:52] that thing is going with the fads of the
[1:15:54] world it doesn't take a prophet to come
[1:15:55] and tell you it's wrong you look at the
[1:15:57] FBS of the world and you can recognize
[1:15:59] that's not of
[1:16:01] God so we can need to be a stute enough
[1:16:04] to recognize these things don't cut
[1:16:07] yourself or don't cut the word to fit
[1:16:09] you but cut yourself to fit the word
[1:16:12] don't pick and choose what you're going
[1:16:14] to receive and what you're not going to
[1:16:15] receive you got to receive it all say
[1:16:17] Lord help me to have the understanding
[1:16:20] of these things so that I can clearly be
[1:16:23] what you want me to be let's keep going
[1:16:26] I'm going to try to close this out and
[1:16:28] whatever time I get done he says now
[1:16:31] notice Believers wait for the word to be
[1:16:33] confirmed so it was not wrote by man but
[1:16:37] by the Lord God therefore it's not a
[1:16:39] book of man now I'm going to shine some
[1:16:41] light here this is what brother bam says
[1:16:43] in modern events made clear through
[1:16:45] prophecy he says somebody said well you
[1:16:47] know it's just a old Hebrew writings a
[1:16:50] book of old Hebrew writings and he says
[1:16:52] now would the Hebrews write a letter
[1:16:54] that condemned them
[1:16:56] eles would that fine nation of Jews
[1:16:59] self-styled polished would they write
[1:17:01] their own iniquities and condemning
[1:17:03] themselves certainly not tell of his own
[1:17:05] sins how they went into idolatry and how
[1:17:08] they committed fornications against
[1:17:10] God's word no they never would tell that
[1:17:13] that proud Nation nor would you write an
[1:17:15] all tale novel telling of everything
[1:17:18] that you've ever done there's some
[1:17:20] things that we have done that we don't
[1:17:21] want anybody to know but God so
[1:17:25] therefore the book The Bible is not a
[1:17:28] book wrote by man or it's a book wrote
[1:17:31] by God and God moved on these men to
[1:17:34] tell these deep dark dirty secrets so
[1:17:37] that they can have faith in knowing that
[1:17:39] that's how God chooses to
[1:17:42] speak he said God does his own choosing
[1:17:45] by predestination chooses the prophets
[1:17:48] for every age notice he fixes his nature
[1:17:51] yeah that's right he fixes his nature of
[1:17:54] the Prophet to fit the age he fits his
[1:17:58] style whatever he does he fits him
[1:18:00] whether he's educated or Not educated he
[1:18:03] fits his gifts the manner that he'll
[1:18:05] preach in the gifts he'll have and the
[1:18:08] message for the certain age God
[1:18:10] predestinated a certain thing to happen
[1:18:12] and there's not another thing can take
[1:18:14] its place and God not only does that for
[1:18:18] profits but he does it also for
[1:18:20] preachers not every preacher is the same
[1:18:23] They Don't Preach in the same style the
[1:18:25] same Cadence and the same passion some
[1:18:28] of us are teachers not me some of us are
[1:18:30] evangelists I raise my hand some of us
[1:18:32] are pastors some of us are are you know
[1:18:35] missionaries there's five different
[1:18:37] degrees or five different levels that
[1:18:39] God chooses we're not all Cookie Cutter
[1:18:42] thank
[1:18:43] God some of you are
[1:18:47] extroverts some of you are introverts
[1:18:49] cuz you're introverting right now
[1:18:53] right this is a time to extrovert I tell
[1:18:56] my friends so they don't get mad at me
[1:18:59] look I'm
[1:19:01] 50/50 I'll introvert for 50% I'm going
[1:19:03] extrovert for 50% you better hope you
[1:19:05] get the extrovert because when I
[1:19:08] introvert I'm checking out my people
[1:19:10] meet her pegs out and I'm going to my
[1:19:12] bedroom see you
[1:19:14] later I love people but I love me
[1:19:17] too at least I got some honest people in
[1:19:19] here
[1:19:20] tonight but God fixes the nature I love
[1:19:24] what he says here he says he makes the
[1:19:26] man of the hour to catch the people of
[1:19:29] the
[1:19:31] hour and it's not a mistake that God
[1:19:33] makes to man of the hour be happy with
[1:19:36] your pastor don't go looking around some
[1:19:38] other Pastor I wish I had so and so from
[1:19:40] my past God makes the man of the hour
[1:19:43] that catch the people of the hour God
[1:19:46] knows exactly what you have need of in
[1:19:49] Elon Kentucky therefore he sent you a
[1:19:51] faithful Minister and he equipped him
[1:19:54] with a kick here in Brother Brad to do
[1:19:56] what so that he would preach to you
[1:19:58] Sundays and Wednesdays to meet the needs
[1:20:01] of the
[1:20:03] hour what God did it in a prophet he
[1:20:05] also does in a
[1:20:09] Ministry wonderful God
[1:20:13] wonderful notice a prophet will be in
[1:20:16] his nature and manners this Prophet this
[1:20:18] Prophet messenger we're speaking of now
[1:20:20] he will be like the Elijah and John
[1:20:25] see the prophet message will be in this
[1:20:26] nature and manners as were Elijah and
[1:20:28] John the people of the prophet's message
[1:20:30] day will be as they were in ahab's day
[1:20:33] and in John's day and since it's only
[1:20:35] the children whose Hearts will be turned
[1:20:38] it's only the children that'll
[1:20:40] listen come on
[1:20:42] somebody since it's only the children
[1:20:45] whose Hearts will be turned it's only
[1:20:46] the children that will listen oh
[1:20:49] somebody come on say Amen again

[1:20:59] it's correction you will listen whatever
[1:21:02] it is coming from behind the pulpit

[1:21:20] stuff y'all didn't know I could teach
[1:21:22] did you
[1:21:24] what is a prophet how many wants to know
[1:21:26] what a prophet
[1:21:27] is about three of y'all all right well
[1:21:29] y'all see me after church we're going to
[1:21:32] stop notice now we're speaking to the
[1:21:34] young people I want you to understand
[1:21:36] what is a prophet
[1:21:38] why why do we need a prophet because God
[1:21:41] has always used but what is a prophet
[1:21:43] he's a
[1:21:44] Seer a prophet he he's a brother B will
[1:21:48] say it's there's a difference between a
[1:21:49] gift of Prophecy and a prophecy a
[1:21:52] prophet he the gift of Prophecy is that
[1:21:55] when it has a gift and a a gift of
[1:21:57] Prophecy must be judged by two or three
[1:21:59] spiritual men and it can come on one
[1:22:01] person tonight and another person the
[1:22:02] next night and another person the next
[1:22:04] night but it has to be judged by two or
[1:22:06] three spiritual men but a G a prophet
[1:22:10] he's born a
[1:22:11] prophet he's not ordained a Prophet by
[1:22:14] man he's not laid Hands On by man he's
[1:22:17] not declared by man or some theology or
[1:22:20] or some School of Theology or some
[1:22:21] denominational backing he is a born
[1:22:25] a prophet he's born a prophet and we
[1:22:26] find the scripture for that we find it
[1:22:29] in Jeremiah and the Bible would tell us
[1:22:31] Jeremiah before I formed you in the womb
[1:22:34] I called you and ordained you a
[1:22:38] prophet so prophets are not chosen by
[1:22:43] man because you know what we would do
[1:22:46] just like they did when Samuel came to
[1:22:49] anoint
[1:22:50] David you look to the best you want the
[1:22:54] best
[1:22:55] you wouldn't pick some five foot five
[1:22:57] short Stumpy little cute
[1:23:00] preacher you're supposed to
[1:23:03] laugh no you're GNA find that nice
[1:23:06] eloquent one that can talk and he
[1:23:08] doesn't spit and slobber you know he can
[1:23:11] put it all together and that's what we
[1:23:14] want but what does God
[1:23:17] want God wants one that's going to get a
[1:23:20] little bit fiery sometimes and slobber
[1:23:22] sometimes he may stumble over his word
[1:23:24] sometimes but he's God
[1:23:27] called I was talking to a brother the
[1:23:29] other day he says you know I've never
[1:23:31] been ordained I've never had a no know
[1:23:34] hands laid on me I said you don't need
[1:23:36] to have that I mean that's all fine and
[1:23:37] dandy if if man I you know if they lay
[1:23:40] hands on you ordained you a preacher I
[1:23:41] said but if God called you God's
[1:23:42] ordained you I said I ain't never had
[1:23:45] nobody lay hands on me but I can tell
[1:23:46] you one thing God uses my Ministry
[1:23:49] because I'm called by God I'm not called
[1:23:51] by man and if some man laid hands on me
[1:23:53] and ordain me then what happens when
[1:23:55] that man dies and he ain't there let me
[1:23:57] tell you my faith is not in some man my
[1:24:00] faith is in my calling and the one who
[1:24:02] has called me and that's who I preach
[1:24:04] for that's why I believe the way I
[1:24:06] [Applause]
[1:24:08] believe and it goes the same for you you
[1:24:10] may not be called the priest but you're
[1:24:12] called The Living you're called the
[1:24:14] serve God and it ain't based on what
[1:24:16] some man sees over you or what some man
[1:24:18] has picked you and said this in a prayer
[1:24:20] line or whatever if God called you and
[1:24:22] turned your heart that's all you need to
[1:24:24] know tonight is I've been called by God
[1:24:27] I've been elected by God I've been
[1:24:29] chosen by God and I'm not going
[1:24:31] back that's all you need to know tonight
[1:24:35] don't worry about some man's and find an
[1:24:37] influence by some man your influence
[1:24:39] comes by the word of God your
[1:24:42] Vindication comes by you receiving the
[1:24:45] message and your heart has been turned
[1:24:48] and your Nature's been changed your
[1:24:50] desires are different
[1:24:56] Hallelujah notice so a prophet now we
[1:24:58] got to get back on that I got to I got
[1:25:01] to hurry
[1:25:02] up notice a prophet is a Seer and he's
[1:25:06] referred to in the Bible as an eagle see
[1:25:09] prophetic and intercessors has often
[1:25:11] been compared to eagles with good reason
[1:25:14] Eagles habitually live in high
[1:25:17] places with some preferring to Nest on
[1:25:21] high Cliffs and when on a hunt their
[1:25:24] King eyesight allows them to spot their
[1:25:26] prey about three miles away look I'm
[1:25:29] barely seeing my Bow Peep site about t
[1:25:32] inches and an eagle can see three miles
[1:25:35] away they have an entirely different
[1:25:37] view of the world than the ground bound
[1:25:40] creatures do and the prophet of God will
[1:25:42] tell a see a prophet is a sear he's
[1:25:44] referred to in the Bible as an eagle who
[1:25:46] goes way up high in the air higher that
[1:25:48] you go the further you see so the eagle
[1:25:51] Soares up higher than any other bird
[1:25:53] there's no bird can go with an eagle
[1:25:56] there's no eye like the eagle see the
[1:25:58] Hulk hasn't got a chance in his sight
[1:26:00] the Hulk cannot stand the altitude of
[1:26:03] where the eagle can soar or he would die
[1:26:05] see he doesn't he hasn't got the makeup
[1:26:07] that the eagle has so an eagle would
[1:26:11] raise up high and he could see things
[1:26:14] that we don't
[1:26:15] see he could see trouble coming before
[1:26:18] trouble's there he can see the storm
[1:26:20] brewing before the storm is
[1:26:23] there and God likened his Prophet to an
[1:26:26] eagle that would go
[1:26:28] up he said he would go up he would climb
[1:26:31] into the rims notice he says he climbs
[1:26:33] beyond the emotion of the
[1:26:36] church because sometimes seems like
[1:26:38] that's all our faith with the church is
[1:26:40] happy I'm happy when the church is down
[1:26:42] I'm
[1:26:43] down come on see a prophet rise he
[1:26:46] climbs beyond the emotion of the church
[1:26:48] he goes beyond the rhythm of the music
[1:26:50] he goes beyond the Clapping of hand he
[1:26:52] goes beyond the joy among the Saints he
[1:26:55] goes beyond all that and God brings him
[1:26:57] up into a real alone then he opens his
[1:27:00] eyes and he lets him look around and see
[1:27:02] the things to
[1:27:04] come then he brings him back down among
[1:27:07] the members of the body to foretell them
[1:27:09] what is in the making so a prophet is
[1:27:13] not a prophet for his own account but
[1:27:15] God has called him and lifts him up into
[1:27:18] a real alone opens his eyes and he
[1:27:20] begins to look and see and he begins to
[1:27:23] see things that are
[1:27:25] coming then he comes down then he begins
[1:27:28] to
[1:27:30] share modern events made clear through
[1:27:33] prophecy he begins to share what's
[1:27:36] coming seven continuous Visions he
[1:27:38] begins to share what's going to happen
[1:27:41] in the end time cuz he's seeing it long
[1:27:44] before it ever comes a
[1:27:49] prophet notice now when I was back in
[1:27:52] the Baptist Church
[1:27:54] man they used to have me so scared of
[1:27:56] the Rapture you know what's going to
[1:27:58] happen in the Baptist Church when a
[1:28:00] Rapture takes
[1:28:02] place airplanes are going to fall out of
[1:28:04] the sky you telling me that every pilot
[1:28:07] is a
[1:28:09] Christian because they crashing planes
[1:28:12] are going to run off the tracks so every
[1:28:14] person that drives a train he's a
[1:28:16] Christian too cars are going to run off
[1:28:18] the road there's going to be uh crashes
[1:28:20] and all kind of craziness going on see
[1:28:23] that's their view of the
[1:28:26] Rapture but what did God do in this hour
[1:28:29] God sent a prophet messenger he went up
[1:28:32] into the Heavenly real and he came back
[1:28:35] down and he told you according to the
[1:28:37] scripture that he's going to come as a
[1:28:39] thief in the night you will not even
[1:28:43] know that he came and took you until
[1:28:45] years later months later you'll be
[1:28:48] looking for us and we'll be gone that's
[1:28:50] the only time life is going to continue
[1:28:53] as it all always
[1:28:56] was you know how it is somebody steals
[1:28:58] something from you you you don't miss it
[1:29:00] immediately well when you go to looking
[1:29:02] for it and you can't find it somebody
[1:29:05] done broke in cuz they didn't go banging
[1:29:07] on the door at 12:00 at night to come in
[1:29:09] your house they slipped
[1:29:12] through they found the crack in the
[1:29:14] window they slid something through the
[1:29:16] door lock and opened up and made their
[1:29:18] they were quiet they tiptoed they didn't
[1:29:20] make a sound they didn't wake nobody in
[1:29:22] the house it ain't going to be Trains
[1:29:24] and Automobiles crashing it's going to
[1:29:26] be as a thief in the night one minute
[1:29:29] you're going to be here the next minute
[1:29:30] you're going to be gone see thank God
[1:29:33] that we had a Prophet come thank God
[1:29:36] that we're not like the world that's
[1:29:38] having to be on medicine and any and a
[1:29:41] depression pills because they're so
[1:29:43] worried and so concerned of where their
[1:29:45] salvation lies and what's going to
[1:29:47] happen when the Rapture takes place
[1:29:48] where they going to be will they make it
[1:29:50] can they make it let me tell you we know
[1:29:52] we will make it
[1:29:54] we know we had a voice in this hour we
[1:29:57] had a messenger in this hour come and
[1:29:59] tell us these things and modern events
[1:30:03] are being made clear now by
[1:30:06] prophecy long before it ever took place
[1:30:10] God lifted him up in 1933 and he be to
[1:30:13] see things that were
[1:30:15] coming woo beautiful
[1:30:18] stuff that's why I don't bother me about
[1:30:21] a message it don't bother me about a
[1:30:22] prophet
[1:30:24] you going to follow a man whether he's
[1:30:27] headquartered in this city that City
[1:30:29] this denomination that denomination I
[1:30:31] follow mine he follows this
[1:30:33] one Hallelujah so let's keep
[1:30:36] going all
[1:30:38] right it's 8:15 what time you want me to
[1:30:41] stop all right nobody said anything
[1:30:45] notice a prophet is also a gift of
[1:30:49] knowledge and knowledge is like an
[1:30:51] attorney he studies the books and when
[1:30:53] you hire an attorney you ain't going to
[1:30:55] hire a dummy you want to make sure you
[1:30:57] get one that knows the law and so a
[1:31:01] prophet as I spoke to you Sunday he goes
[1:31:03] back and he looks at what the other
[1:31:05] prophets before him wrote to make sure
[1:31:09] that what he is saying is in line with
[1:31:11] what they said because if he says
[1:31:13] anything different then he's not a god-
[1:31:16] called
[1:31:18] Prophet notice a gift of knowledge in
[1:31:20] the Bible is a prophecy which goes up
[1:31:22] and finds out the things that are to
[1:31:24] come and brings them back down and but
[1:31:26] they must compare with the Bible see
[1:31:28] then the word that God has spoken I want
[1:31:30] you to catch this part right here this
[1:31:33] is in the impersonation of Christianity
[1:31:35] then the word that God has spoken before
[1:31:38] the foundation of the world it isn't
[1:31:40] that God speaks and says something to
[1:31:42] the prophet at that time catch that it
[1:31:46] isn't that God speaks and says something
[1:31:48] to the prophet at that time it is that
[1:31:51] the prophet catches what God has already
[1:31:54] he said for the word was before the
[1:31:57] foundation of the world God spoke the
[1:31:59] word it's laying out way out stretched
[1:32:02] out in time and the prophet goes up and
[1:32:04] he sees the time coming so it's only of
[1:32:07] gift of knowledge that brings it down
[1:32:09] and puts it on
[1:32:11] paper and for us he put it on real to
[1:32:14] real put it on tape put it on CD now
[1:32:18] it's on
[1:32:20] MP3 so a prophet is the word this is in
[1:32:23] the revelation of Jesus Christ a prophet
[1:32:25] is the word we know that the word
[1:32:27] Prophet means divine interpreter of the
[1:32:28] word so the Divine word is wrote The
[1:32:31] Prophet has a Divine gift of God within
[1:32:33] him and you know the prophet in the Old
[1:32:35] Testament he was called a God so if you
[1:32:37] go to John 10 and verse 33 the Pharisees
[1:32:41] here are talking to Jesus and Jesus
[1:32:43] answered them he says now is it not
[1:32:46] written in your law I said you are gods
[1:32:50] and if he called them Gods unto whom the
[1:32:52] word of God came to referring to the
[1:32:54] prophets and the scripture cannot be
[1:32:56] broken so he's telling them well I'm
[1:32:59] saying I'm a Son of God but yet you can
[1:33:02] say that the prophets are called God and
[1:33:03] you're having a problem with me saying
[1:33:05] I'm just a Son of God not God at
[1:33:08] all so we find this when you go to
[1:33:11] Exodus 71 the Lord said unto Moses I
[1:33:14] have made thee a
[1:33:17] God to
[1:33:19] Pharaoh I've made thee a God to pharaoh
[1:33:21] and Aaron is your Prophet he's your
[1:33:24] mouthpiece so a prophet is God's
[1:33:27] mouthpiece notice he will not be God but
[1:33:31] he will be God's
[1:33:35] mouthpiece and there's never been in any
[1:33:37] Age Two Major Prophets on the earth at
[1:33:40] one
[1:33:42] time Elijah and Elijah walked arm and
[1:33:45] arm but Elisha never put on Elijah's
[1:33:48] robe until Elijah
[1:33:50] left only one major prophet in a
[1:33:55] generation yeah that's right one major
[1:33:58] prophet in a generation now you find
[1:34:00] there's people that claim they going to
[1:34:01] be they're going to fulfill they're
[1:34:02] going to finish what the seventh message
[1:34:05] left off
[1:34:08] hogwash call it hogwash one major
[1:34:12] prophet to a generation we have received
[1:34:15] that major prophet he's gone up he's
[1:34:17] broke the seals he loosed the seals he
[1:34:19] told us the things that are come he
[1:34:21] talked about a Rapture we're going to be
[1:34:23] there we know all these things we're not
[1:34:24] looking for somebody else to come and
[1:34:26] finish we got what we need all we got to
[1:34:29] do is heed what the prophet warned us
[1:34:31] about make preparation that we will fit
[1:34:33] that same scripture in that same life
[1:34:35] when he comes to catch away the bride we
[1:34:38] will go with
[1:34:40] him so how do we do that you line up to
[1:34:43] the
[1:34:45] word so there's one major Propet to a
[1:34:47] generation we'll keep moving on Jeremiah
[1:34:49] we talked about that jeremiah: 15 before
[1:34:51] I form thee in the belly I knew thee and
[1:34:54] before thou camest out of the womb I
[1:34:55] Sanctified thee and ordained thee a
[1:34:57] prophet to the Nations so a prophet is
[1:34:59] not called by
[1:35:02] man when I first came to the ministry I
[1:35:04] will be honest with you brother Brad I
[1:35:06] struggled because I didn't have nobody
[1:35:08] tell me I was God called you know how
[1:35:10] sometimes you want somebody to tell you
[1:35:12] give you a little
[1:35:13] encouragement I see a gift in your life
[1:35:16] no nobody told
[1:35:17] me no but there was something there
[1:35:20] because look before I came to the
[1:35:21] message I was about to go to Seminary
[1:35:24] cuz I knew what God did for me when I
[1:35:26] when he took me out of the world I was
[1:35:28] on fire for God I quit drinking I quit
[1:35:32] cussing I quit partying I quit
[1:35:34] womanizing I quit it all before I came
[1:35:37] to this
[1:35:38] message because I met God and I want to
[1:35:42] do something and so a local church
[1:35:43] Baptist Church reach reached out to me
[1:35:45] and said we want you to be our youth
[1:35:47] pastor and we'll send you to Seminary
[1:35:49] I'm like man yeah this is what I'm
[1:35:52] talking about I want to do something for
[1:35:54] God and at the same time that that was
[1:35:56] happening I come in contact with the
[1:35:59] message you want to talk about spiritual
[1:36:02] warfare Satan trying to keep his man
[1:36:04] that's why I said Satan you had me when
[1:36:05] I was in the world but you had to let go
[1:36:08] then you had me when I was in the
[1:36:09] denomination but you had to let go why
[1:36:11] because God already a seed on the inside
[1:36:14] and it may be covered up with sin it may
[1:36:17] be covered up with religious ideas but
[1:36:19] oh Hallelujah one day one day that
[1:36:22] seed's going to burst out to
[1:36:25] life I know it's Wednesday night but we
[1:36:28] can have hey I just saw a clip of your
[1:36:30] pastor jumping all over the place
[1:36:31] slobbering telling exhorting y'all for
[1:36:33] gratitude or attitude or something of
[1:36:35] that
[1:36:36] nature man we can have church up in
[1:36:40] here knowing that we're in line
[1:36:42] everything we believe is backed by the
[1:36:45] Bible this ain't some fairy tale this
[1:36:47] ain't some good book feeling this is
[1:36:50] thus sayith the lord it's in the word
[1:36:54] you can hang your soul on every word
[1:36:57] written in this Bible you don't have to
[1:37:00] fear you don't have to be ashamed of it
[1:37:02] you don't have to be embarrassed it's
[1:37:04] backed up by the Bible and it's backed
[1:37:06] up by
[1:37:08] God yes
[1:37:10] it notice this Prophet we're going to
[1:37:14] hurry up and bring this
[1:37:15] down this prophet he goes up and he SE
[1:37:18] things he sees the cup of iniquity full
[1:37:22] before it's filled
[1:37:25] didn't Isaiah
[1:37:27] say there's going to be Darkness upon
[1:37:30] the land and gross Darkness upon the
[1:37:33] people now Isaiah is a prophet it ain't
[1:37:37] no telling how many years it's 3,000
[1:37:40] 4,000 years ago God lifted up this
[1:37:42] Prophet into a rim and guess what he's
[1:37:45] seeing our day he's seeing our day he's
[1:37:50] seeing Darkness upon the land you

[1:38:58] how we would say it today you done
[1:39:00] bumped your head nut head no God lifted
[1:39:03] him
[1:39:05] up and people today they want to
[1:39:07] question your Prophet they want to
[1:39:09] question what he got lifted up look I
[1:39:12] don't question
[1:39:13] it you question all you want I'm living
[1:39:16] it that's right I know where I was and I
[1:39:19] know that what what what couldn't be
[1:39:21] done out there in denominational system
[1:39:23] it got done in this system cuz it ain't
[1:39:26] some man-made Kingdom it's God's kingdom
[1:39:28] it's a kingdom of redemption it's a
[1:39:30] kingdom of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:32] it's a kingdom of a nature change it's a
[1:39:34] life change and I know what I was and I
[1:39:37] know what I am today and it ain't been
[1:39:39] by some man but God said a word and the
[1:39:42] word has changed
[1:39:44] us and God deals with us through a
[1:39:48] prophet therefore I'm not ashamed to say
[1:39:51] I believe that God sent a prophet
[1:39:54] not ashamed at all brother Ram says
[1:39:56] prophets are the chief sign prophets are
[1:39:59] the chief sign God's chief sign is a
[1:40:02] prophet if God is going to speak he will
[1:40:04] send a
[1:40:06] prophet you hear me if God is going to
[1:40:09] speak he will send a
[1:40:13] prophet they are his word made manifest
[1:40:16] for the age that's the reason a prophet
[1:40:18] always God's chief sign and in another
[1:40:20] place I just listened to it that a
[1:40:22] prophet is a true sign that's
[1:40:25] overlooked because it doesn't go with
[1:40:27] the
[1:40:28] mainstream because it sounds a little
[1:40:30] bit
[1:40:30] oldfashioned it sounds a little bit
[1:40:32] spiritual sounds a little bit religious
[1:40:36] fanatic
[1:40:41] cultish y'all drank the
[1:40:44] Kool-Aid no we a drink the Kool-Aid we
[1:40:46] got to fill with the Holy Spirit cu the
[1:40:49] holy spirit will lead us and guide us
[1:40:51] into all truth
[1:40:53] I tell people when I I had a buddy of
[1:40:55] mine I'm sharing some personal stuff I
[1:40:57] had a buddy of mine when I first came to
[1:40:58] this message he and I went to church
[1:41:00] together we study together you know we
[1:41:02] were College not roommates but we were
[1:41:04] college buddies and man we spent all
[1:41:05] kind of time together when when I when I
[1:41:07] came to this message man he got online I
[1:41:09] started finding out about serpent seed
[1:41:11] and about this and about that and all
[1:41:12] this stuff and he called me on the phone
[1:41:13] he said Joe you're in a Coke get out he
[1:41:16] was crying a grown man crying to me get
[1:41:20] out he what in this world does this deal
[1:41:22] with the serpent SE I didn't know
[1:41:24] squat all I knew is something they got I
[1:41:27] ain't got and I want
[1:41:29] it and so I began to study by the time I
[1:41:32] mean I studied and I studied and you
[1:41:34] know God was already pulling on me to
[1:41:35] preach but I was studying and studying
[1:41:37] and studying so I had the opportunity
[1:41:39] brother Thomas said go back to my
[1:41:41] hometown or the town where we went to
[1:41:42] college and he was still in college and
[1:41:44] I'd already graduated and I invited him
[1:41:46] over to my hotel room he done messed up
[1:41:48] now old boy got about a year
[1:41:50] understanding behind him so we went back
[1:41:51] there man I broke serpent seed down to
[1:41:54] him I said come on let's go to Genesis 3
[1:41:56] let's look at it you tell me what the
[1:41:58] Bible says about it I made him read it
[1:42:01] with his own mouth he couldn't deny I
[1:42:03] will put him INE between thy seed and
[1:42:06] the Serpent's Seed that's thus sayeth
[1:42:08] the Lord you can't argue with the word
[1:42:11] either he's right or he's wrong either
[1:42:13] he had a seat or he didn't have a seat
[1:42:15] and he walked out of my hotel room with
[1:42:17] his head between his leg because he
[1:42:19] realized the word never fails you may
[1:42:22] not understand it I may not understand
[1:42:25] it but it ain't based on understanding
[1:42:27] it is based on Revelation and I believe
[1:42:30] God has sent us exactly what we have
[1:42:32] need of to get out of
[1:42:35] here divine revelation of the written
[1:42:38] word a prophet of God will bring that
[1:42:40] divine
[1:42:44] revelation I love it God always sends a
[1:42:49] prophet he always has he always will
[1:42:54] that's his method numbers 12 and verse 6
[1:42:57] and he said hear now my words if there
[1:42:59] be a prophet among you I the Lord will
[1:43:02] make myself known unto him in a
[1:43:04] vision and will speak unto him in a
[1:43:07] dream God has a way of doing
[1:43:11] things let's keep going
[1:43:15] here
[1:43:17] hallelujah amen let me find my place
[1:43:23] so a prophet is an
[1:43:26] interpreter for a deity a prophet a
[1:43:30] Seer there's a difference between the
[1:43:32] gift of
[1:43:33] Prophecy and the office of a
[1:43:37] prophet so we find God never changes he
[1:43:40] always does it the same he said the
[1:43:42] coming of a prophet is a sign that God
[1:43:45] is ready to
[1:43:46] speak and if he's spoken which we
[1:43:49] believe he has because our Prophet or
[1:43:52] his prophet is off the scene let me just
[1:43:55] say this we have to listen to
[1:43:58] him we have to study this word study
[1:44:01] what he says make it make sense
[1:44:04] understand also that as a man he grew in
[1:44:07] his Revelation and understanding some of
[1:44:10] the things he preached in 57 58 59 he
[1:44:13] got more clarity in 63 64 65 remember in
[1:44:16] 63 he became a brand new book therefore
[1:44:19] the things he used to see prior to 63 he
[1:44:22] was dealing with Lucen
[1:44:24] after 63 he had a new book come on
[1:44:28] church I'm trying to tell you even
[1:44:30] though he's a prophet he's still a human
[1:44:32] he had his own share of mistakes but
[1:44:34] when it came to thus sayith the Lord he
[1:44:36] never once failed because it wasn't him
[1:44:39] cuz he could only speak what God put in
[1:44:41] his
[1:44:43] mouth so a prophet is a sign that God is
[1:44:46] ready to speak and he doesn't change we
[1:44:48] found that out in Malachi 3
[1:44:51] and we we look here in Revelations
[1:44:55] 10 brother B would tell us in God's only
[1:44:59] provided place of worship that a prophet
[1:45:02] is God's
[1:45:03] reflector how many knows that all right
[1:45:07] good a reflector doesn't reflect itself
[1:45:09] the reflector isn't the reflection see
[1:45:12] there has to be something strike the
[1:45:14] reflector to reflect it to make it
[1:45:16] reflect so let me just kind of put it in
[1:45:19] Louisiana terminology
[1:45:23] brother Joe you got a life-sized mirror
[1:45:26] in your bedroom you walk by
[1:45:32] it
[1:45:34] boy what are you doing you're looking in
[1:45:36] the mirror what it reflecting oh your
[1:45:41] silliness but
[1:45:43] see that's what we are to God that's
[1:45:46] what a prophet is he's only mirroring
[1:45:49] out reflecting what is being reflected
[1:45:51] to
[1:45:53] you know me I like look when I get in a
[1:45:55] full length mirror man I like to show
[1:45:59] out oh yeah brother Tommy knows what I'm
[1:46:02] talking about we got guns I may be close
[1:46:05] to 50 but hey I still got it get in
[1:46:08] there and start posing like
[1:46:12] Jessica yeah you ain't marryed no old
[1:46:14] man whoop
[1:46:16] whoop get out and show up but I'm only
[1:46:19] only thing that's going to be reflected
[1:46:21] back is what I put into it
[1:46:23] and that's the way it I know that's kind
[1:46:25] of silly but that's the way it is with
[1:46:26] god with a prophet he's only reflecting
[1:46:30] what God has put into it that's right
[1:46:32] he's a reflect and so are we reflectors
[1:46:35] so what do we find when we get to
[1:46:37] Revelations 10 and we find his John type
[1:46:40] of the bribe he's being encouraged take
[1:46:42] the
[1:46:44] book take the book eat the book consume
[1:46:48] the book but that ain't where it stops
[1:46:51] it doesn't stop with just well hey I
[1:46:53] believe God sent a prophet or way you
[1:46:55] know I believe the message of the hour
[1:46:56] it's more than just believing thou must
[1:47:00] prophesy
[1:47:02] again see it's it's one thing for a
[1:47:05] prophet to be the mouthpiece of God but
[1:47:07] notice brother Brandon what tell us
[1:47:09] there's coming a time that listen what
[1:47:11] he says he says now the in the Dark Ages
[1:47:14] the word was almost entirely lost to the
[1:47:16] people but God sent Luther with the word
[1:47:18] and the Lutheran spoke for God at a time
[1:47:20] but they organized and again the pure
[1:47:22] word was lost from organization Trends
[1:47:24] toward they Trend to toward doctors and
[1:47:26] Creeds and and and they not the simple
[1:47:29] word and they can no longer speak for
[1:47:31] God then God sent Wesley and he was a
[1:47:33] voice with the word in his day and the
[1:47:35] people who took his Revelation from God
[1:47:37] became the living Epistles read and
[1:47:39] known of all men for their generation
[1:47:42] but when the Methodist fell God raised
[1:47:44] up others and is going through years
[1:47:46] until this last day there is again a
[1:47:49] people in the land who under their
[1:47:51] Messenger will will be the final voice
[1:47:54] to the final age look it's more than
[1:47:56] just God said and the prophet we have
[1:47:59] heard that message we have received that
[1:48:01] message we have taken that book we had
[1:48:03] devoured that book and now we are the
[1:48:06] voice we are the
[1:48:09] mouthpiece we are God's mouth how do you
[1:48:12] say we are the mouthpiece I Don't Preach
[1:48:14] I'm a I'm a lady I'm a sister your life
[1:48:17] preaches it your long hair your modesty
[1:48:21] your dignity you young boys you line up
[1:48:24] to the word you don't tell dirty jokes
[1:48:26] you're not looking at things you
[1:48:27] shouldn't looking at your life is clean
[1:48:29] and holy and modest that's how you
[1:48:31] preach the message that's how you
[1:48:33] prophesy
[1:48:37] again you
[1:48:38] reflect as a prophet reflects God so do
[1:48:41] we reflect God let me just say something
[1:48:44] else you also reflect the leadership of
[1:48:47] this
[1:48:47] church you local assembly you also
[1:48:50] reflect the leadership the Ministry of
[1:48:53] this
[1:48:54] church you line up to what is being
[1:48:58] preached does it mean you have to agree
[1:49:01] with it all now let's just be honest
[1:49:02] because sometimes we may see things a
[1:49:04] little different but because that's your
[1:49:07] spiritual head your leadership you do it
[1:49:10] anyway at least you
[1:49:12] should shouldn't be adversarial so you
[1:49:15] reflect the views of your church you you
[1:49:18] reflect the views of your
[1:49:21] pastor you reflect Christ in all that we
[1:49:26] do so let's go on I'm going to bring
[1:49:30] this down right
[1:49:32] here so to Revelations 10 it shows that
[1:49:34] the seventh Angel's message will be a
[1:49:36] person in the last days anointed of God
[1:49:39] for a Ministry just like Elijah the
[1:49:42] prophet as predicted in Malachi 4 to
[1:49:44] reveal the true word of the original
[1:49:46] word original God in the generation the
[1:49:49] original word of God in this generation
[1:49:51] see it's the seven Angel as spoken of
[1:49:54] Revelations 10 the same person they
[1:49:57] asked brother Bram excuse me let me let
[1:49:58] me rephrase this this is in question
[1:50:00] answerers ask brother is the seventh
[1:50:02] angel as spoken of in Revelations 10 the
[1:50:05] same Elijah in Malachi
[1:50:08] 4 young people this is going to be maybe
[1:50:11] new for you older people you already
[1:50:12] know the answer yes it's the same
[1:50:15] person see Revelations 10 is the seventh
[1:50:18] Angel's message which the seventh
[1:50:20] Angel's message of the seventh Church
[1:50:22] age which is Malachi 4 which turns the
[1:50:24] heart of the people back to the faith so
[1:50:28] we're living musicians if you would make
[1:50:29] your way back we're closing
[1:50:33] now musicians I mean are y'all out
[1:50:37] there you have me scared me and brother
[1:50:39] Thomas have y'all H us lately W brother
[1:50:43] Josh better make your way buddy oh
[1:50:46] whoever's closing
[1:50:47] out excuse me I better stay in my Lane
[1:50:53] so yes the Malachi 4 and the revelations
[1:50:56] 10:7 are the same so we're living in the
[1:51:01] hour of fulfillment I spoke to you on
[1:51:04] Sunday Israel is in her Homeland first
[1:51:07] time in 2500
[1:51:10] years but before there can be an end
[1:51:12] time there has to be a
[1:51:14] prophet Malachi 4:5 and6 must be
[1:51:17] fulfilled and if not William brandham
[1:51:20] then who you just answer me that if not
[1:51:23] William brandham then where is that
[1:51:26] messenger Prophet messenger that's going
[1:51:28] to fulfill Malachi 45 and6 I don't care
[1:51:31] the naysayers in the world you answer me
[1:51:33] that question before this world will be
[1:51:35] destroyed there has to be a Malachi 4
[1:51:38] Ministry fulfilled there has to be a
[1:51:40] people whose hearts are
[1:51:42] turned believe the sign dis believe the
[1:51:44] sign I don't care about your sign I'm
[1:51:45] telling you right now there has to be
[1:51:47] somebody and for me it's already been
[1:51:50] fulfilled cuz my heart heart has been
[1:51:54] turned I can't base it on anything else
[1:51:56] but I know that my heart I don't know
[1:51:58] about you but I know my heart's been
[1:52:00] turned Luke 17:30 has been fulfilled
[1:52:05] we're living in the day of Sodom and
[1:52:07] gomorra you look
[1:52:10] around Sodom condition but we also
[1:52:12] receive the son of man Ministry in this
[1:52:14] hour that's right think about it if this
[1:52:18] isn't Sodom and Gomorrah then what age
[1:52:19] are we living in
[1:52:22] I hate to see where we will be in 10
[1:52:25] years if this is not it now everywhere
[1:52:28] we go we encounter Sodom
[1:52:31] Spirits you run headlong in Walmarts gas
[1:52:35] stations you may not even know but you
[1:52:37] bumping into those Spirits all the time
[1:52:39] Sodom gamor liberal remember where
[1:52:44] there's no vision the people perish lack
[1:52:48] of restraint do what I want to do I'm en

[1:52:55] some of you did you hear the little
[1:52:57] press conference your vice president had
[1:53:00] the other day somebody spoke up and said
[1:53:02] Jesus Christ is Lord she stopped and
[1:53:05] said you're at the wrong
[1:53:06] rally you're at the wrong rally you
[1:53:09] should be at the little one down the
[1:53:14] street Sodom condition no desire for God
[1:53:20] nowhere lgbqt has enter the churches in
[1:53:23] politics and our school
[1:53:25] systems churches the Methodist churches
[1:53:28] now have
[1:53:29] homosexual
[1:53:32] preachers transgender gay sitting right
[1:53:35] in the service say well Jesus loves us
[1:53:38] all he loves you but he wants to change
[1:53:41] you you're welcome to come but you're

[1:53:46] same come on in but be changed let the
[1:53:50] word wash you let it change you let it
[1:53:52] reach regenerate you but that's not the
[1:53:54] preaching we find the scriptures are
[1:53:57] being fulfilled Revelations 3 and verse
[1:54:00] 20 Jesus Christ is on the outside of his
[1:54:03] church begging Brother Brad to get back
[1:54:05] in knocking brother Thomas for somebody
[1:54:07] to open the
[1:54:09] door notice samesex couples in the
[1:54:12] church and he's just trying to call some
[1:54:14] of them out come out of her my people be
[1:54:18] not partakers of her
[1:54:20] plagues Revelations 10:7
[1:54:23] the
[1:54:24] Mysteries have been
[1:54:27] fulfilled the loose sins from the
[1:54:29] previous ages have been tied together
[1:54:31] the seals are all finished then we look
[1:54:34] in Zechariah 12 and verse 2 and the
[1:54:36] Bible says and I will make Jerusalem a
[1:54:38] coup of trembling unto all the people
[1:54:40] round about when they shall be the siege
[1:54:43] both against Judah and against Jerusalem
[1:54:45] in that day will I make Jerusalem a
[1:54:48] burdensome stone for all the people
[1:54:53] as of the 22nd of May 19 or not 19 but
[1:54:56] 2024 bise Bolivia Colombia All severed
[1:55:00] diplomatic relations with Israel bearan
[1:55:03] Chad Chile Honduras Jordan South Africa
[1:55:05] turkey have all recall the ambassadors
[1:55:06] from Israel citing aeli actions during
[1:55:09] the war US President Joe Biden was
[1:55:11] warned that Israel risked losing
[1:55:13] international support over its
[1:55:15] indiscriminate bombing of civilians in
[1:55:17] its war against Hamas in a besieged Gaza
[1:55:20] Strip Biden also suggest suggested that
[1:55:22] the US views Israel government as
[1:55:26] extreme that word extreme means a
[1:55:29] terrorist
[1:55:30] organization our president suggests that
[1:55:34] we view Israel as a terror
[1:55:38] organization some of Israel's closest
[1:55:40] European allies pressed for a ceasefire
[1:55:42] in the war with Hamas on a Sunday this
[1:55:45] has been several weeks ago underscoring
[1:55:47] growing International unease with the
[1:55:48] devastating impact of the conflict on
[1:55:50] Gaza civilians United Nations General
[1:55:53] Assembly voted 124 to4 on Wednesday to
[1:55:56] strip Israel of the right to
[1:55:58] self-defense in the West Bank Gaza and
[1:56:01] East
[1:56:02] Jerusalem telling me that they can come
[1:56:04] into your home into your neighborhood
[1:56:06] into your city and you can't fight
[1:56:09] back several weeks back many of you
[1:56:12] probably heard Iran bombed Israel with
[1:56:14] 200 bombs not one hit its Target those
[1:56:19] that made it through Israel Defense
[1:56:20] System fell on sand land never even
[1:56:23] exploding they fell in targets why
[1:56:26] because God Is Watching Over Israel and
[1:56:29] if Israel is the natural what about God
[1:56:32] Watching Over Us you don't have to fear
[1:56:36] little
[1:56:37] bride there's nothing that we had to
[1:56:39] fear if he can watch over naturalism and
[1:56:41] keep her safe without anybody being
[1:56:44] destroyed any death anything what about
[1:56:46] us we have nothing to fear God has sent
[1:56:49] you a message God has sent you a word we
[1:56:51] are living in the hour of
[1:56:55] fulfillment we are

[1:57:36] are you in your
[1:57:38] position are you in your
[1:57:43] position for when that time comes he's
[1:57:46] coming as a thief in the night he's not
