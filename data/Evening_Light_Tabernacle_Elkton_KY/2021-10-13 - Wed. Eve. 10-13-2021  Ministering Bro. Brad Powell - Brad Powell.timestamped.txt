[45:06] tonight
[45:08] speaking about grace man where would we
[45:10] be without grace and happy needs grace
[45:13] amen every man should be up i was
[45:16] reading today and it said grace you know
[45:18] what it stands for
[45:19] god's riches at christ's expense
[45:23] and i thought that's pretty good
[45:25] explanation right there
[45:28] so let's bow our heads we'll go before
[45:30] the lord in prayer heavenly father we're
[45:32] thankful lord to be in your house once
[45:33] again tonight lord to
[45:35] bring the word of life lord and we just
[45:37] ask lord that you would quicken the word
[45:39] to us lord that your spirit would move
[45:41] amongst us and and lord it would just
[45:43] minister to our hearts needs and
[45:45] words that would draw us closer to your
[45:47] words that would inspire us and
[45:49] encourage us and words that would help
[45:51] us to identify who we are in this late
[45:52] hour father because lord we don't have
[45:55] much time left father lord we just want
[45:57] to be right and be ready when the time
[45:59] comes we just want to tell you we love
[46:00] you we appreciate you we dedicate the
[46:03] remainder of this service into your
[46:04] hands that your will and your way would
[46:07] be done in jesus name amen amen if you
[46:10] will just have your seats for a minute i
[46:13] i don't want to keep you up i got a long
[46:14] reading i kind of want to lay a little
[46:16] background with the thought that come to
[46:18] me and before we get into the reading of
[46:20] the word and i i want to just focus
[46:22] tonight if i could
[46:24] uh focus our thoughts
[46:26] on the holy ghost and uh you know
[46:30] wednesday nights are a little different
[46:31] uh they always are a little different we
[46:33] don't have you know quite quite we got a
[46:36] good crowd tonight but not not like on a
[46:38] sunday but i find it easier myself to
[46:41] speak to 500 instead of
[46:43] 50 so that's just that's just me so i
[46:45] have to get in my get in a comfort zone
[46:47] here to be able to to go but i want to
[46:50] focus on the holy ghost and
[46:52] questions surrounding the holy ghost
[46:54] and
[46:55] because i believe many times we make the
[46:57] holy ghost harder than what it is
[47:00] and getting the holy ghost having the
[47:02] holy ghost how do i know i've got the
[47:04] holy ghost those kinds of questions and
[47:07] and i think it's really easy it's really
[47:09] simple if we look at it so i want to
[47:10] break it down and and when i was
[47:12] thinking about that thought that come on
[47:13] my mind you know i got to thinking about
[47:15] the conductor and we talk about a
[47:18] conductor and an orchestra and we've
[47:20] we've heard that illustration over time
[47:21] many times the conductor and the
[47:23] orchestra and and i just thought more
[47:25] about it i thought what is the
[47:26] responsibilities of this conductor
[47:29] you know what you know we know he guides
[47:31] the musicians he gets up and he keeps he
[47:33] does all this but what are his true
[47:35] responsibilities so i looked it up and i
[47:38] found it really really nice and
[47:40] interesting so the primary
[47:41] responsibilities of the conductor are to
[47:44] unify the performers
[47:48] to unify the performers and when i
[47:51] thought about that i thought that makes
[47:52] perfect sense if you've ever seen a been
[47:55] to a musical or a production where the
[47:58] performers are getting ready they're
[47:59] they're all in their own little world
[48:01] they're tuning their instruments you
[48:03] hear where when why you hear the violins
[48:05] you hear the the bass over here you hear
[48:07] the
[48:08] all these different sounds and noises
[48:10] and every single one of them there are
[48:12] professionals
[48:15] they're all great as individuals are you
[48:18] with me
[48:19] god's children are all great as
[48:21] individuals
[48:23] but somebody has to come and unify
[48:26] the performers
[48:28] and pull them together and they're
[48:30] they're working on that and you hear
[48:31] that tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
[48:32] he takes that little baton
[48:34] and he gets their attention
[48:36] what happened on the day of pentecost
[48:39] there was great individuals there and it
[48:41] took somebody to come and unify them and
[48:43] pull them all together into an upper
[48:44] room
[48:47] and unify the group what else does he do
[48:50] he sets the tempo and he
[48:52] executes clear preparations
[48:57] my goodness how much clearer could that
[48:59] be
[49:00] he executes the tempo or sets the tempo
[49:03] he tells us when
[49:04] and where and he keeps a beat and he's
[49:07] executing the clear preparations he made
[49:09] his clear exactly clear what we have to
[49:12] do and what we have to achieve to be
[49:14] able to make it on that day the great
[49:16] conductor
[49:18] and and he says he the next thing i like
[49:20] he says he listens critically
[49:24] he listens critically
[49:27] and sometimes we think we can't even
[49:28] take anything to god because we think
[49:30] it's too small
[49:32] or it's too great
[49:33] it's not important
[49:35] but this conductor listens critically
[49:37] and he he listens critically and he
[49:39] shapes the sound of the ensemble
[49:43] his job is to control
[49:46] the interpretation
[49:51] we had a messenger
[49:54] sent to control the interpretation
[49:57] there's no misinterpretation of the word
[49:59] out there anymore the word has been
[50:01] opened the words went forth the voice
[50:03] has spoken
[50:05] and so he's there to
[50:07] to control the interpretation and the
[50:10] pacing of the music and then this was
[50:12] one i really thought stood out to me and
[50:13] his communication is non-verbal
[50:19] so how many of you this week raise your
[50:21] hand because i want to speak to you
[50:23] have heard from god lift
[50:25] actually a voice that spoke to you this
[50:27] week and told you to do something
[50:30] not me brother david he heard from god
[50:32] lift the ear voice
[50:34] praise the lord that doesn't happen
[50:36] every day
[50:37] that doesn't but most of the time god
[50:39] speaks to us in a non-verbal type state
[50:45] and he does he ensures that the
[50:46] candidates have the playing style
[50:50] and tone
[50:51] that he prefers
[50:54] see you're not just going to go in on
[50:56] any way you want to
[50:59] because god has a purpose he has a he
[51:01] has a plan
[51:02] he has a a
[51:04] a script laid out to the way we have to
[51:07] walk the way we have to talk the way we
[51:09] have to live
[51:11] so he picks these candidates and he
[51:12] looks and makes sure that their playing
[51:14] style and their tone is what he prefers
[51:17] and the last one i like
[51:19] and he ensures
[51:21] that the candidates meet the highest
[51:24] performance
[51:25] standards
[51:27] you see god doesn't accept second place
[51:30] very well
[51:33] he don't want to be in second place he's
[51:35] not gonna allow us as believers to put
[51:37] him in second place in anything we do
[51:40] god
[51:42] looks for perfection
[51:44] amen let's stand we'll go to the bible
[51:46] if we would turn to romans chapter 8.
[51:50] i just i hope that helps somebody that's
[51:52] what we're going to look at today and it
[51:53] just stood out to me and if it's not for
[51:55] anybody in the building this whole
[51:57] message is for me and i'll i'll take
[51:59] because i needed it
[52:02] romans chapter eight it's important to
[52:04] know romans chapter eight here it's a
[52:06] declaration
[52:07] in romans chapter eight it's declaring
[52:09] that those who are who are with christ
[52:11] are
[52:12] more than conquerors
[52:14] romans chapter eight says that those who
[52:15] are with god should not fear anything of
[52:17] this world because god is greater than
[52:19] all things
[52:21] so we keep that in mind as we read here
[52:24] there is
[52:26] there is therefore i think i met yeah
[52:28] verse 1 chapter 8 verse 1. there is
[52:30] therefore now no condemnation to them
[52:32] which are in christ who walk not after
[52:35] the flesh but after the spirit now that
[52:37] tells us not much good comes from this
[52:39] flesh
[52:40] and we can all agree to that that
[52:42] anything any thought anything i've ever
[52:44] had in the flesh has not been very
[52:46] pleasing to god
[52:49] for the law of the spirit of life in
[52:51] christ jesus hath made me free from the
[52:53] law of sin and death
[52:55] for what the law could not do and that
[52:58] it was weak through the flesh
[53:00] god sending his own son in the likeness
[53:02] of sinful flesh
[53:04] and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[53:08] that the righteousness of the law might
[53:10] be fulfilled in us
[53:12] watch now who walk not after the flesh
[53:15] but after the spirit
[53:17] for they that are after the flesh do
[53:20] mind the things of flesh
[53:22] so what happens there those who's
[53:23] thinking about fleshly things they're
[53:25] going to try to
[53:26] accomplish fleshly things and more than
[53:28] likely they're consumed with me me me i
[53:31] i i
[53:32] because it's flesh
[53:34] he said but they that are after the
[53:36] spirit
[53:38] that are after the spirit the things of
[53:40] the spirit
[53:43] so those people are about their father's
[53:45] business
[53:47] for to be carnally minded is death to be
[53:51] spiritually minded is life and peace i
[53:53] want to know what is carnally minded
[53:55] what we hear that and we think about i
[53:56] thought what in the world does it really
[53:58] mean so if if you've got your things on
[54:00] things of the flesh we know we're
[54:01] carnally minded but carnal that word
[54:04] comes from the word meat
[54:06] so carney which is a spanish word for
[54:09] meat
[54:11] means you're carnally minded means to
[54:14] live after things that animals live for
[54:18] so that kind of changes the perspective
[54:20] of what carnally mind it is you're
[54:22] thinking like an animal
[54:24] you're thinking about wanting to desire
[54:26] the full desires of animals
[54:29] carnally minded
[54:31] because the carnal mind is enmity
[54:32] against god for it is not subject to the
[54:35] law of god neither indeed can be so
[54:38] then they that are in the flesh cannot
[54:41] please god it's impossible
[54:44] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[54:46] spirit if so be the spirit of god dwell
[54:49] in you now if any man have not the
[54:51] spirit of christ he is none of his and
[54:54] if christ be in you the body is dead
[54:56] because of sin
[54:57] but the spirit of life
[54:59] because of righteousness
[55:01] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[55:03] jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[55:05] raised up christ from the dead shall
[55:07] also quicken your mortal bodies
[55:10] by his spirit that what dwelleth in you
[55:14] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[55:16] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[55:19] you live after the flesh ye shall die
[55:22] that's pretty plain
[55:23] but if ye through the spirit do mortify
[55:26] the deeds of the body ye shall live
[55:29] keep this in mind that number 14.
[55:31] for as many are led by the spirit of god
[55:34] they are the sons of god
[55:37] for he have not received the spirit of
[55:38] bondage again to fear but you have
[55:40] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[55:42] we cry abba father
[55:46] which means my daddy or my papa
[55:49] and
[55:50] the little jewish boys there they that's
[55:52] where they come from the little jewish
[55:53] boys if they've got a real personal
[55:56] a real loving relationship with their
[55:58] daddy they call him abba father
[56:02] so
[56:03] number 16 the spirit itself beareth
[56:05] witness with our spirit that we be
[56:07] that we are the children of god god
[56:10] bless you you can have your seats may
[56:11] god bless the reading of the word
[56:15] so i'm going to try to just kind of take
[56:16] my time i don't think i'm going to be
[56:18] long or hold you along tonight i know
[56:19] it's been a probably a week for
[56:21] everybody uh but uh
[56:24] we want to take a little thought here
[56:25] and just kind of break it down i want to
[56:27] mess title my message tonight led by the
[56:30] spirit of who we are
[56:32] and and i know that's a mouthful and
[56:34] it's a lot to think about and but i just
[56:36] want you to break that down what i said
[56:39] led by the spirit of who we are you know
[56:42] last wednesday night brother ben nora he
[56:44] spoke and he spoke to us and he spoke on
[56:46] overcoming and and we overcome by what
[56:49] we overcome by the spirit of god we
[56:51] through the spoken word he said you'll
[56:52] speak into your overcoming and then
[56:55] sunday brother byler spoke on greater is
[56:57] he that is in me
[56:59] so who is he
[57:01] who is he
[57:03] that's god that's the holy spirit that
[57:04] lives and dwells inside of his people
[57:06] greater is he that lives in me than in
[57:08] the world and so tonight i'm going to
[57:11] look at led by the spirit of who we are
[57:12] and i hope we can see as believers that
[57:15] the message as the messages are showing
[57:17] up and as god is showing us who we are
[57:20] this is not just here this is around the
[57:22] around the country and around the world
[57:24] because god is coming into a place that
[57:26] he wants us to recognize who we are so
[57:29] that we can gain an identity and then an
[57:32] identity that we will be needing to get
[57:34] out of this world because this world is
[57:36] coming to a climax
[57:39] this world is coming to a climax and
[57:41] brothers and sisters i'm not going to be
[57:43] dwelling here much longer you're not
[57:45] going to be dwelling here much longer as
[57:47] the song says this world is not my home
[57:49] we're just passing through
[57:52] and when we think about that we're just
[57:54] passing through life is but a moment in
[57:58] time
[58:00] you've heard brother byler speak of it
[58:02] as we get older
[58:04] as we get older time speeds up
[58:06] and you would think as you get older
[58:08] things would slow down
[58:10] but that's not the case time seems to
[58:13] speed up and we're just here for a short
[58:15] season somebody asked me here it was a
[58:17] month or two up to what how old are your
[58:19] boys what grade are they in now i said
[58:21] well carson's a freshman and wesson is a
[58:22] junior and joel said western ain't no
[58:24] junior he's a senior
[58:26] but just like that
[58:27] and it went that quick and i thought man
[58:29] that's right he is a senior he's fixing
[58:31] to go he's fixing to move out go to
[58:33] college he's going to pursue things but
[58:35] life just keeps moving faster and faster
[58:37] and faster
[58:38] and jesus even makes mention of this in
[58:41] in
[58:42] in john chapter 8 the scribes and the
[58:45] pharisees i love this scene because they
[58:46] come to jesus and they're bringing this
[58:48] woman who's been called in the act of
[58:50] adultery
[58:52] and as they bring this woman who's been
[58:54] caught in the act of adultery
[58:56] and they begin to try to catch jesus in
[58:58] a trap they want to try to outwit him
[59:01] and they want to try to to prove that
[59:02] he's not who he says he is or who who
[59:04] he's been known to become
[59:06] and they look at him and they're saying
[59:08] the law of moses says that we're going
[59:10] to stone this woman to death that's what
[59:12] the law of moses says for us to do
[59:16] and i always like to say because jesus
[59:18] he just kneels down
[59:21] and he begins to write in the dirt and
[59:22] he doesn't really pay any attention at
[59:24] all to what they're saying and they keep
[59:27] hitting at him with the law law law let
[59:30] me tell you what moses said moses said
[59:32] we got to do this what do you say jesus
[59:34] moses said we caught her in the very act
[59:36] what do you say jesus and he just keeps
[59:38] his head down ignoring their very their
[59:40] thoughts
[59:41] or their words
[59:43] until finally he stands up and he says
[59:45] those without sin cast the first stone
[59:50] and where was all our accusers
[59:53] they left
[59:55] but did the pharisees and the scribes
[59:57] leave
[59:59] see god works things out in our life god
[1:00:01] will step up and he'll speak and he'll
[1:00:03] go to the go to the bat for so to speak
[1:00:05] and he'll mark things out but your your
[1:00:07] accusers will never leave
[1:00:10] they came right back and they started
[1:00:11] putting more at him and i'm asking more
[1:00:13] about this law and that law and this law
[1:00:15] until jesus finally stands up and he
[1:00:17] says listen i'm not of this world
[1:00:22] you say what i'm saying we're not of
[1:00:23] this world
[1:00:24] and jesus looks at those accusers the
[1:00:26] pharisees and scribes and he says you're
[1:00:28] from beneath it
[1:00:32] but i'm from above i'm not of this world
[1:00:35] you're the ones that's of this world
[1:00:36] you're beneath it brother and sister
[1:00:38] playtime is over
[1:00:40] jesus looks at these scribes and
[1:00:41] pharisees and says
[1:00:43] it's over
[1:00:44] i know where i stand and we've got to be
[1:00:46] in a place in this hour that we're
[1:00:48] living in as we see the world coming to
[1:00:50] a climax let me tell you it can't go
[1:00:52] much farther
[1:00:54] and we've heard that and we've heard
[1:00:55] that we've heard that but there is so
[1:00:57] much idiocracy that i see happening in
[1:01:00] government and the government is going
[1:01:01] to send this thing over the edge
[1:01:05] they're going to send this over the edge
[1:01:07] we know it's going to happen
[1:01:09] and we've been thinking for years we're
[1:01:10] going to see it but i really believe
[1:01:12] we're fixing to see it
[1:01:16] so we better know
[1:01:19] we better know if we're being led by the
[1:01:20] spirit
[1:01:22] or are we being driven by force
[1:01:26] see there's difference there are you
[1:01:27] being
[1:01:28] are you being led in everything you do
[1:01:30] you know i find it i think about i find
[1:01:33] it kind of amusing
[1:01:35] that people want to talk about led by
[1:01:36] the spirit they always think they got
[1:01:38] the preacher in mind
[1:01:40] i hope father's led by the spirit when
[1:01:42] he preaches today
[1:01:44] i hope he's under the spirit when he
[1:01:45] what about you
[1:01:48] what about the believers sitting in the
[1:01:50] pews we all have to be led by the spirit
[1:01:52] are we being led by the spirit on our
[1:01:54] jobs
[1:01:55] are we being led by the spirit when we
[1:01:56] go to the grocery store and we see
[1:01:58] somebody and maybe they have a need is
[1:02:00] god nudging you
[1:02:03] we're all led by the spirit
[1:02:08] from the pastor to the church mouse
[1:02:10] we're all led by the spirit
[1:02:13] brother brown said i ask you christian
[1:02:15] friend
[1:02:16] what if he was dying tonight
[1:02:20] could america save you
[1:02:23] i would say that was the same response
[1:02:25] he got
[1:02:29] but he says let me warn you
[1:02:32] let me warn you this was in 59 i think
[1:02:36] let me warn you get right with god
[1:02:39] he said get the spirit get acquainted
[1:02:41] with the heavenly things of that spirit
[1:02:43] that come down from heaven where
[1:02:45] holiness stands
[1:02:47] where angels of god stand where jesus
[1:02:49] christ stands at the right hand of god
[1:02:51] in majesty and glory and holiness and
[1:02:54] power of god
[1:02:56] he said then you walk as a stranger here
[1:02:59] because you're an alien here you're not
[1:03:01] of this world
[1:03:03] we got to get ourselves into a place
[1:03:05] that we stand in holy places
[1:03:07] i'm not there i will be honest
[1:03:14] i'll be honest if you'll be honest
[1:03:19] i got room i got room i never got room i
[1:03:21] need to grow in that area
[1:03:24] brothers and sisters we become so
[1:03:25] consumed with the assets and the world
[1:03:27] here
[1:03:29] things that really don't matter
[1:03:32] things that really don't matter when you
[1:03:34] know i i seen it on facebook and it's
[1:03:36] just come to me but i seen that picture
[1:03:37] on facebook it showed the rich man's
[1:03:39] house and the poor man's house and a
[1:03:41] rich man's grave in the poor man's grave
[1:03:44] you know what looked the same
[1:03:47] a six foot deep hole
[1:03:49] we didn't we're not taking any houses
[1:03:51] with us we're not taking any cars with
[1:03:53] us we're not taking any businesses with
[1:03:54] us our assets but yet our homes our
[1:03:56] careers our businesses our fleshly
[1:03:59] pleasures
[1:04:00] many times we fail to realize that just
[1:04:02] how insignificant we make god
[1:04:08] and we talk about putting god in in
[1:04:10] first place
[1:04:11] i wonder if he's even on the top 10 list
[1:04:15] that hurts
[1:04:21] but when we die
[1:04:24] when we die
[1:04:30] we're going to go somewhere
[1:04:35] and every day we're breathing
[1:04:39] think of the thousands of thoughts and
[1:04:41] images
[1:04:43] and sounds
[1:04:44] that go through our minds and through
[1:04:45] our eyes and through our ears
[1:04:48] especially if you have to go out into
[1:04:50] the public
[1:04:53] think about all this but during that
[1:04:54] time
[1:04:56] you know someday if we don't go by the
[1:04:58] way of the rapture we're gonna we're
[1:05:00] gonna we're gonna die
[1:05:03] and every breath you take we're making
[1:05:05] preparations
[1:05:07] of where we're going to go
[1:05:10] we're making preparations of where we're
[1:05:12] going to go because this
[1:05:13] you don't just end
[1:05:16] carson and i we were at a little
[1:05:18] restaurant that we like to go to in
[1:05:19] clarksville and i'd seen on facebook
[1:05:21] that uh one of their employees a young
[1:05:23] young man had passed away and
[1:05:26] it kind of it was sudden and i kind of
[1:05:28] wondered what was what it was i didn't
[1:05:29] really know i never known the young man
[1:05:31] never knew him never knew who he was but
[1:05:33] when we went in to eat and i i seen up
[1:05:36] front they had a little donation box you
[1:05:38] know for his funeral and so forth and
[1:05:40] just looked like a nice young man and i
[1:05:42] asked i said what what happened to the
[1:05:44] young man
[1:05:46] and he said they don't know
[1:05:48] 22 years old so don't know if his heart
[1:05:50] stopped or his brain quit they don't
[1:05:52] know what
[1:05:53] and i kind of just left it alone
[1:05:56] because i could tell he he was kind of
[1:05:58] getting tore up a little bit about it
[1:05:59] and what the long man carson said he
[1:06:01] come over to our table and he began to
[1:06:04] talk he said you know it hit me pretty
[1:06:05] hard he said he died 22 years old he
[1:06:08] said it brought back a lot of memories
[1:06:10] to me he said my sister died when she
[1:06:12] was 22 years old
[1:06:14] and he said i'm 34 and he said you know
[1:06:16] this young man had his whole life out in
[1:06:18] front of him
[1:06:20] and then the next statement got me
[1:06:22] he said but now he ceased to exist
[1:06:27] and it was the time of the place
[1:06:30] but i thought my goodness
[1:06:33] that young man is not ceasing to exist
[1:06:36] he's either in heavenly place where
[1:06:38] there's love peace joy
[1:06:42] where there's happiness
[1:06:44] or he's where there's weeping and
[1:06:45] wailing and gnashing of teeth and
[1:06:47] torment
[1:06:49] but he did not just cease to exist
[1:06:55] and that brought to reality the
[1:06:56] seriousness of what he had said and i
[1:06:58] thought my goodness what am i doing for
[1:07:00] god
[1:07:02] what am i doing for god what am i doing
[1:07:04] am i being led by the holy ghost in
[1:07:06] everything i do am i fully dedicating
[1:07:09] every better bit of breath and effort
[1:07:11] that i've got to do something for god
[1:07:15] because people think they cease to exist
[1:07:22] jesus said you're not of this world
[1:07:24] little children
[1:07:25] neither am i of this world i pray for
[1:07:28] you
[1:07:30] and brother branham talks about that he
[1:07:31] said jesus prayed for his church
[1:07:34] that they would not be of this world he
[1:07:37] prayed for him don't be of this world he
[1:07:40] said i don't care
[1:07:42] you're not american
[1:07:45] this is a prophet
[1:07:47] and we get so patriotic sometimes
[1:07:50] but you're not american
[1:07:52] get it out of your head
[1:07:54] if you want to make it we've got to get
[1:07:56] to the realization we're not americans
[1:08:00] we're not jamaicans
[1:08:02] we're not europeans we're not africans
[1:08:04] he says you're christians
[1:08:06] he said you're christians and if you're
[1:08:08] christian your spirit's from up there
[1:08:11] he said if you're christian it makes you
[1:08:13] live holy
[1:08:14] if you're christian it makes you want to
[1:08:16] be holy if you're christian it makes you
[1:08:18] want to act like christ and act like god
[1:08:21] and your whole desire is on
[1:08:24] heaven and not this world
[1:08:34] how i fail
[1:08:38] my dad and i were driving down the road
[1:08:40] and
[1:08:41] was saying
[1:08:42] right down the road right across yeah
[1:08:44] right yeah right across the road here
[1:08:46] mennonite was out plowing a field had a
[1:08:48] team with five or six horses
[1:08:50] i said you know i don't think i'm gonna
[1:08:52] live that way all the time but that'd be
[1:08:54] pretty neat
[1:08:55] and my dad he don't have a care in the
[1:08:57] world
[1:09:01] he's not worried about his kid making
[1:09:03] the baseball team
[1:09:06] not worried about if
[1:09:07] if
[1:09:09] you know his his wife's
[1:09:11] having an affair at work
[1:09:14] he's not worried about if the husband's
[1:09:16] out
[1:09:16] gambling or doing this or that i'm not
[1:09:18] saying they don't have that stuff but
[1:09:20] he's working behind a team of horses
[1:09:24] he don't have all this clutter that goes
[1:09:27] around in his mind and i thought you
[1:09:28] know that dad you're right he probably
[1:09:30] don't have a whole lot of cares
[1:09:33] not like us
[1:09:35] because we make our cares
[1:09:38] we make our cares
[1:09:41] you know i find out people generally do
[1:09:42] in life what they want to do
[1:09:46] you make time for whatever you want to
[1:09:48] do
[1:09:50] we had something out it was something to
[1:09:52] do with the moms the other day something
[1:09:53] went disastrous i can't remember what it
[1:09:55] was you know how the devil is
[1:09:58] and my dad said you know we we should
[1:10:00] have done that but we didn't have much
[1:10:01] time i said i had time dad
[1:10:04] he said well you've been busy so i said
[1:10:06] don't make excuses for me i've done what
[1:10:08] i wanted to do
[1:10:10] i knew that should have been done and i
[1:10:12] didn't do it so now we pay the
[1:10:14] consequences
[1:10:16] he just looked at me okay
[1:10:19] but we do generally what we want to do
[1:10:22] but living brothers and sisters living
[1:10:24] in the spirit means living as a child of
[1:10:26] god
[1:10:27] let's look back at our scripture for as
[1:10:28] many as are led by the spirit of god
[1:10:30] these are the sons of god for you do not
[1:10:32] receive the spirit of bondage to fear
[1:10:34] but you receive the spirit of adoption
[1:10:36] by whom we cry abba father
[1:10:39] so doesn't it make sense that the sons
[1:10:40] of god shall be led by the spirit of god
[1:10:44] that just makes good sense in life don't
[1:10:46] it
[1:10:46] you know i i'm raising my kids i want to
[1:10:49] be the one leading them
[1:10:51] i want to be the one guiding them and
[1:10:53] telling them which way they need to go
[1:10:54] you better not do this you better go
[1:10:56] here you better not go there
[1:10:59] that's my kids
[1:11:00] and we're sons and daughters of god
[1:11:03] and god wants to be the one doing the
[1:11:04] leading but sometimes we get it all
[1:11:06] scrupled up and we think we're going
[1:11:08] down the right channels in life
[1:11:12] well if i go to church
[1:11:15] you know if i go to church
[1:11:17] if i read my bible
[1:11:20] but that's not what paul said
[1:11:22] paul didn't say as many as go to church
[1:11:24] these are sons of god as many as read
[1:11:26] their bible and pray are sons of god
[1:11:29] he didn't say as many as claim the
[1:11:31] message are sons of god
[1:11:35] he didn't say as many as take communion
[1:11:37] are the sons of god
[1:11:40] think about that
[1:11:43] the devil goes to church
[1:11:47] what was next
[1:11:49] the devil can read the bible
[1:11:52] he knows he's in it he sees himself in
[1:11:54] it he knows
[1:11:58] he's been all around the message
[1:12:01] sitting in here tonight
[1:12:04] no doubt in my mind satan's here tonight
[1:12:09] and jesus took communion
[1:12:13] think about it
[1:12:14] so all these things don't make you sons
[1:12:16] of god but our text tells us that to be
[1:12:19] a son or daughter of god that person has
[1:12:21] to be led by the spirit of god
[1:12:23] so how are we led by the spirit of god
[1:12:27] we're guided
[1:12:28] god simply leads us through guidance
[1:12:31] he nudges you to do things he brings you
[1:12:33] here he tells you to do this to do that
[1:12:36] and it's for your well-being sometimes
[1:12:38] sometimes it's for the well-being of
[1:12:40] others sometimes it's when you got a
[1:12:41] problem he's the solution
[1:12:43] but he guides you through these ways
[1:12:44] i'll give you an example
[1:12:47] we had honey this year and we had more
[1:12:49] than what we had anticipated i guess but
[1:12:51] you know with kobe there's no jars those
[1:12:53] people in arkansas don't work no more
[1:12:56] arkansas glass shut down
[1:13:00] i couldn't get enough jars
[1:13:02] so i drive all the way to cerulean
[1:13:03] kentucky to a guy who's who's supposed
[1:13:05] to have thousands of jars and i pull up
[1:13:08] and i say mr shirk
[1:13:10] i'm here to get some jars do you have
[1:13:11] any jars
[1:13:14] he said
[1:13:15] ain't no jars in this country to be had
[1:13:18] i said i don't need about 150 maybe 200
[1:13:21] at the most can you can you spare some
[1:13:23] i've seen him in his warehouse he's i
[1:13:26] got to have this for our sorghum
[1:13:29] i said okay
[1:13:31] i understand he said but you
[1:13:32] you might try going to all these little
[1:13:34] bitty stores you might find some that
[1:13:35] nobody's grabbed yet
[1:13:39] i'm driving down the road and i'm
[1:13:40] thinking where am i gonna find these
[1:13:42] jars
[1:13:43] somebody's got to have some jars i go to
[1:13:45] the dollar store wiped out
[1:13:48] tsc wiped out walmart wiped out kroger
[1:13:50] wiped out joel's causeway says is it
[1:13:52] major am i what is it myers what mate
[1:13:55] whatever it is y'all know what i'm
[1:13:56] talking about you ladies do
[1:13:57] they got them up in a little i'm not
[1:13:59] driving to louisville to go get the jars
[1:14:04] what am i going to do
[1:14:07] and then that little still small voice
[1:14:09] of guidance
[1:14:11] said hey do you remember bill abel that
[1:14:12] come by
[1:14:13] he was a he's he's a a broker for
[1:14:16] flowers he knows people all over the
[1:14:19] tree
[1:14:20] call him
[1:14:22] i said bill he said yeah what do you
[1:14:24] need i said i don't need no flyers i
[1:14:26] said i need jars i said do you know
[1:14:28] anywhere in the country around me where
[1:14:30] i could find some jars
[1:14:32] he said the only place i can thanks a
[1:14:33] little place in fort campbell just on
[1:14:35] the other side of the the interstate
[1:14:37] there it's a little country store a
[1:14:38] little mennonite store he said they had
[1:14:40] some go
[1:14:43] you know which way i went
[1:14:46] i went in there and i said hey you have
[1:14:47] any jars yes sir how many you need i
[1:14:50] said praise the lord
[1:14:53] i got more jars than i need now i got
[1:14:55] about a 200 left over but that's just
[1:14:57] how god leads us and guides us he cares
[1:15:00] and if you'll follow his leadership and
[1:15:02] guidance in business in life in in your
[1:15:05] homes in your marriages in your schools
[1:15:07] you'll find yourself being led by the
[1:15:09] spirit of god and you'll find yourself
[1:15:11] at peace
[1:15:12] because you know god's in it
[1:15:17] he draws us
[1:15:18] he leads us by drawing us
[1:15:21] he draws us to himself
[1:15:24] you know it's something about whenever
[1:15:26] you hear about a meeting close by or
[1:15:28] something's fixing to happen for church
[1:15:30] you get a little you get a little angry
[1:15:31] if somebody don't ask you to come
[1:15:34] that's if you're being drawn
[1:15:36] if you want to be closer to god
[1:15:38] and those services and stuff are
[1:15:40] announcing those things and god begins
[1:15:41] to draw you close to him
[1:15:44] and sometimes when you on another note
[1:15:46] whenever you get going through life and
[1:15:47] you find fear or sadness or something
[1:15:50] comes over you and you just say man god
[1:15:53] what's going on and he says just come
[1:15:55] close son
[1:15:57] just come close daughter
[1:15:59] and he draws you near to him
[1:16:02] he's our governing authority
[1:16:06] we can't even walk without him holding
[1:16:08] our hand
[1:16:09] he's our governing authority but what we
[1:16:11] got to learn to do is to yield ourself
[1:16:15] and be conscious
[1:16:17] of the still small voice
[1:16:19] be conscious of god's leading and
[1:16:21] guiding and directing us because let me
[1:16:23] tell you he's not going to force you
[1:16:25] into anything
[1:16:28] prophet said he was a gentleman
[1:16:34] did you know you don't have to go to
[1:16:35] church
[1:16:38] no
[1:16:40] he's not going to force you
[1:16:44] did you know you don't have to pay your
[1:16:45] tithes
[1:16:46] don't worry about it
[1:16:52] he's not going to force you
[1:16:55] he'll never force anything on you you
[1:16:57] don't have to read you don't have to
[1:16:58] pray you don't have to do any of that
[1:16:59] stuff
[1:17:01] he's not going to force any of it on you
[1:17:03] he's not going to come and and force
[1:17:05] these things on you but if you're a real
[1:17:07] christian led by god and you've got the
[1:17:08] holy spirit that holy spirit is going to
[1:17:11] tell you i'll be a church when the door
[1:17:12] is open that holy spirit will tell you
[1:17:15] i'm going to pay my first fruit to god
[1:17:17] that holy spirit will tell you i want to
[1:17:19] read and i want to pray and i want to
[1:17:21] commune and talk and learn and love you
[1:17:23] more god
[1:17:24] that's the holy spirit on the inside
[1:17:29] now if you feel like you don't have to
[1:17:30] do those things you might want to check
[1:17:32] your spirit
[1:17:36] because as christians
[1:17:38] we're on free moral agency
[1:17:42] brother brown said this
[1:17:44] i never had seen this this little story
[1:17:47] some of you maybe have i've never called
[1:17:49] it he said i want to give you a slogan i
[1:17:51] want you to remember it
[1:17:53] do right that's your duty to god
[1:17:56] think right that's your duty to yourself
[1:17:59] and you're bound to be right
[1:18:04] let me say it again do right that's your
[1:18:06] duty to god think right that's your duty
[1:18:09] to yourself and you're bound to be right
[1:18:13] see you'll come out right if you'll do
[1:18:15] right
[1:18:16] that's your duty to god think right
[1:18:18] that's your duty to yourself and you'll
[1:18:20] come out right brothers and sisters
[1:18:22] we have to do what's right in life
[1:18:27] i've told my boys from a young age boys
[1:18:29] whatever you do
[1:18:31] do it right
[1:18:34] do the right thing
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:36] not because somebody's watching here or
[1:18:38] not because you want notoriety but do
[1:18:40] the right thing just because it's the
[1:18:42] right thing to do
[1:18:44] if you will do that you'll be all right
[1:18:46] in life
[1:18:47] but it's when we try to shortcut it's
[1:18:49] when we try to do things the back way
[1:18:51] it's when we try to do a little sloppy
[1:18:54] deal or something that's when we get
[1:18:55] into trouble
[1:18:57] because there's no getting out of it
[1:18:59] you tell a lie you have to tell a bigger
[1:19:01] one to get out of that one
[1:19:03] and it'll catch up with you
[1:19:05] i got another story i'll tell you in a
[1:19:06] few months wait till this one comes
[1:19:08] about you'll like this one
[1:19:12] but you got to tell another lie to get
[1:19:14] out of a lie out of a lie
[1:19:16] out of a lie
[1:19:18] listen to the still small voice
[1:19:22] james tells us to submit yourselves to
[1:19:25] god resist the devil
[1:19:28] and he'll flee
[1:19:30] so when you've got thoughts in your mind
[1:19:31] should i do this
[1:19:33] should i be going over here should i be
[1:19:35] listening to this should i be looking at
[1:19:37] this
[1:19:38] flea
[1:19:40] because if you got to question it i can
[1:19:42] about guarantee you shouldn't be
[1:19:44] participating
[1:19:48] this is for our young people how many
[1:19:50] young people we got
[1:19:51] we got a few young people say look
[1:19:53] listen up
[1:19:57] he said i told my boy here when he was
[1:19:59] about 14 years old
[1:20:02] his brother brown talking to billy paul
[1:20:04] he said stand and hold your hands out
[1:20:06] like this son
[1:20:08] he said you're coming to adolescence now
[1:20:10] a place where i'm away from home a lot
[1:20:14] and he said i won't be able to direct
[1:20:15] you he said his mother's dead he said
[1:20:18] but i want you to hold your hands out
[1:20:19] like this this is your right hand this
[1:20:21] is your left hand
[1:20:23] and he said i want you to look at it
[1:20:24] this way this is your right hand this is
[1:20:27] your wrong hand
[1:20:29] if you're left-handed i'm sorry
[1:20:32] but he said in life he said you can't be
[1:20:34] going right and wrong at the same time
[1:20:38] he said you can't be going right or
[1:20:39] wrong at the same time you may think
[1:20:41] you're going right
[1:20:44] but it's wrong
[1:20:46] he said always remember where your right
[1:20:48] is come to that right don't go wrong he
[1:20:51] said when you're going that way you may
[1:20:53] think this is wrong he might even think
[1:20:54] this is wrong he said but it's going to
[1:20:56] be right you're bound to come out right
[1:20:58] so this is god this is satan if you
[1:21:01] follow god and what you've been taught
[1:21:03] you're going to come out all right he
[1:21:05] said that's the truth he said just
[1:21:07] remember anytime you ever get in trouble
[1:21:09] and daddy comes to you i'm going to
[1:21:11] spread out my hands like this and say
[1:21:14] which side did you take
[1:21:17] has anybody ever heard that
[1:21:21] you've heard it sister
[1:21:22] i've never heard him give this
[1:21:23] illustration but he said he said i'm
[1:21:25] going to come to you and i'm going to
[1:21:26] spread my arms out and say which side
[1:21:28] did you take son you're a free moral
[1:21:31] agent now
[1:21:33] the decision is his do i go this way or
[1:21:36] do i go this way and he said you
[1:21:38] remember this he said i've raised you up
[1:21:40] the best that i know he said to your age
[1:21:43] now he said but you're going out with
[1:21:44] other boys in high school and college
[1:21:46] and around and you're going to have
[1:21:48] everything before you
[1:21:54] everything
[1:21:55] before you
[1:21:57] and he said but remember always hold
[1:21:59] fast to the right
[1:22:02] keep to the right
[1:22:04] and you'll come out
[1:22:06] all right
[1:22:10] amen
[1:22:13] so you ask where does the holy spirit
[1:22:15] lead us
[1:22:17] how do i know you know these are the
[1:22:19] questions people say how does the holy
[1:22:21] spirit lead us how do i how do i know if
[1:22:23] i'm being led by the holy spirit maybe
[1:22:25] young christians sometimes wonder how do
[1:22:27] i even know if i've got the holy spirit
[1:22:30] the bible tells us by their fruits you
[1:22:33] shall know them and there's two truths
[1:22:35] to that
[1:22:36] if you've got the holy spirit they're
[1:22:38] going to know you by your fruits you're
[1:22:40] going to produce love and peace and joy
[1:22:42] and long-suffering and forgiveness those
[1:22:44] are the things that are going to be
[1:22:45] coming out of you
[1:22:47] and also on the flip side of that if
[1:22:49] you've got the holy spirit
[1:22:51] and you're around people that don't have
[1:22:52] the fruit of the spirit your spirit's
[1:22:54] going to be grieved
[1:22:57] they're going to start talking the way
[1:22:58] you don't you don't talk
[1:23:00] they're going to start
[1:23:02] discussing things you don't want to
[1:23:04] discuss
[1:23:05] they're going to start looking at things
[1:23:06] you don't want to look at
[1:23:08] and the spirit inside of you if it's
[1:23:10] grieved and said ooh i don't i don't
[1:23:12] really this is this is not that's not
[1:23:13] where i want to be that's a good
[1:23:15] indicator you got the holy ghost
[1:23:18] and if people said man that's the most
[1:23:20] loving person
[1:23:21] he's so kind
[1:23:23] he he he's so forgiving to everybody
[1:23:25] he's just he just he's just a special
[1:23:27] kind of person there's a good sign
[1:23:28] people are saying the holy ghost working
[1:23:30] through you
[1:23:32] so look let those kind of be two little
[1:23:34] indicators but what else how else do we
[1:23:36] know that the holy ghost is leading us
[1:23:39] he leads us to repentance
[1:23:42] and this is a hard one for us
[1:23:45] but you if you've got the holy ghost
[1:23:47] that holy ghost won't let you be
[1:23:49] satisfied with doing something wrong or
[1:23:51] thinking bad thoughts or thinking bad
[1:23:54] about somebody until you make it right
[1:23:58] so the holy ghost is constantly leading
[1:24:00] us in repentance i had a situation i had
[1:24:01] to make right for 20 years ago a couple
[1:24:04] of weeks ago
[1:24:08] it wasn't easy i hadn't thought about it
[1:24:09] in years had no thought of it until i
[1:24:12] seen the man
[1:24:14] and i went up to him and i said
[1:24:17] i said brother
[1:24:20] i said i need to talk to you
[1:24:23] he said yeah what what you got brother
[1:24:25] brad i said well
[1:24:27] i tell you what about
[1:24:30] 15 or 20 years ago
[1:24:33] people told me some things about you
[1:24:36] and i said i was young
[1:24:38] i was i was
[1:24:40] i was not as stable as i am
[1:24:42] i said i just was listening
[1:24:45] and i said i
[1:24:47] i listened to him enough
[1:24:49] that i established
[1:24:51] who you was based on what they said
[1:24:54] and i said i've held i've held you to
[1:24:56] their standard ever since
[1:25:00] i said i didn't know nothing about it to
[1:25:02] be the truth i said but i've held that
[1:25:04] and thought of you in the way of the
[1:25:05] light they showed you to me ever since i
[1:25:08] said i'm sorry i said i i hate it i said
[1:25:10] because i think we could have had a an
[1:25:12] amazing friendship and fellowship with
[1:25:14] one another
[1:25:15] and said
[1:25:17] man
[1:25:18] he said i've been there before
[1:25:21] and i thought
[1:25:25] thank you lord
[1:25:27] he said don't you worry about that
[1:25:29] he said don't think another thought
[1:25:30] about it
[1:25:33] but it had to be made right
[1:25:36] 15 to 20 years ago
[1:25:40] two weeks ago it was made right and the
[1:25:42] freedom that i felt the burden that
[1:25:44] lifted off of me i didn't even know i
[1:25:46] had
[1:25:48] so today a day after i walk a little
[1:25:50] lighter
[1:25:51] because i made something right god told
[1:25:54] me said hey this guy you got to get this
[1:25:55] off your shoulders you've carried it
[1:25:56] long enough
[1:25:58] you're holding a guy accountable for
[1:25:59] something he didn't even do
[1:26:05] how do we know we're being led by the
[1:26:06] spirit
[1:26:09] he leads us
[1:26:12] he leads us to think little of ourself
[1:26:15] and much of him
[1:26:18] the smaller i can make myself
[1:26:20] the greater god becomes
[1:26:23] that don't matter if you're a song
[1:26:25] leader it don't matter if you're a
[1:26:26] musician
[1:26:28] a singer a preacher
[1:26:30] laity in the pew
[1:26:32] the smaller you can make yourself more
[1:26:34] humble you can make yourself
[1:26:37] the greater your god will be
[1:26:41] he leads us
[1:26:43] unto truth
[1:26:45] we know we've had the fullness of the
[1:26:46] word in this hour
[1:26:48] and to deny that would be denying god
[1:26:51] so if if people are around this message
[1:26:53] have turned around and walked away and
[1:26:55] left the message
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:26:58] they've denied the truth a question
[1:27:01] a
[1:27:03] and i'll just leave it at that
[1:27:07] he leads us unto love
[1:27:10] you know i find it just interesting when
[1:27:13] jesus is at the last supper we call it
[1:27:15] and he's uh
[1:27:16] he's telling all the disciples about
[1:27:18] what's fixing to happen and and his his
[1:27:20] terms his language and they they're
[1:27:22] they're just kind of bum-fuzzled and
[1:27:23] can't really figure out what's happening
[1:27:25] and it says right after he he subbed
[1:27:27] with judas
[1:27:29] he dipped in there
[1:27:30] you know what a couple lines down the
[1:27:32] next thing he says he says i give you a
[1:27:34] new commandment
[1:27:36] he said i give you a new commandment
[1:27:38] unto you that you love one another as i
[1:27:41] have loved you
[1:27:44] right after the one that's to betray him
[1:27:47] dip bread together
[1:27:50] as i have loved you that you also love
[1:27:52] one another and by this shall all men
[1:27:55] know that you are my disciples if you
[1:27:57] have love one to
[1:28:00] another
[1:28:02] wow
[1:28:05] that's amazing statement
[1:28:07] when you think about the scene that
[1:28:08] jesus knows is about to unfold and who
[1:28:10] just sold him out and he says i'm going
[1:28:12] to tell you guys what you've got to do
[1:28:14] if you want to be associated with me you

[1:29:52] daughters of god

[1:29:56] daughters of god
[1:29:58] representing ourselves every time we go
[1:30:00] out
[1:30:03] and in our homes
[1:30:05] you know a lot of times people can
[1:30:06] represent out in public but how do they

[1:31:37] you know this story
[1:31:40] brother brown talks about the
[1:31:43] slave trade
[1:31:45] and it's one of the greatest stories i
[1:31:46] think he ever told
[1:31:50] he said sometime down in the south lands
[1:31:52] he said we come down here you know the
[1:31:54] people go and they buy slaves and
[1:31:56] and he said they they buy a bunch of
[1:31:58] them and bring them over here like use
[1:32:00] cars he said these are human souls and
[1:32:02] they buy them and sell them
[1:32:04] and he said they go around and they have
[1:32:06] legal papers on them and they they just
[1:32:08] like an automobile and they
[1:32:09] commercialize it and they sell them and
[1:32:11] they trade and
[1:32:12] they sell them off and so forth he said
[1:32:14] but a buyer came to a certain place to
[1:32:16] this certain plantation
[1:32:18] and he said he come wanting to buy some
[1:32:20] slaves
[1:32:21] and he looked over there and he said
[1:32:24] he looked around and he said he noticed
[1:32:26] a young slave there had his chest out
[1:32:30] head up
[1:32:35] chest out and head up
[1:32:37] and he said he looked around the very
[1:32:38] rest of them and they look very
[1:32:39] disturbed and weary
[1:32:41] he's like because they've been brought
[1:32:42] out of their homeland
[1:32:45] they've been captured and brought in
[1:32:47] from another country of a people they
[1:32:48] didn't know
[1:32:49] people they couldn't speak with
[1:32:51] different people
[1:32:53] and men placed with women that wasn't
[1:32:55] their women
[1:32:56] that's the way that it was a trade
[1:33:00] and he said they were there away from
[1:33:02] their homeland they were so sad and they
[1:33:03] wouldn't work and they would beat them
[1:33:05] and they would take whips and beat them
[1:33:07] and beat them
[1:33:09] and he said he he knew they wasn't going
[1:33:11] back to home so they were sad he said
[1:33:14] but not this young man
[1:33:16] he stuck his chest out
[1:33:18] he said he was snappy
[1:33:20] ready anytime
[1:33:22] there's work to be done let's do it
[1:33:26] he said the buyer said let me buy that
[1:33:27] one
[1:33:29] no
[1:33:30] he's not for sale
[1:33:32] he said well i've never seen a slave act
[1:33:34] like that he's a dandy
[1:33:36] he said i'll give you more than what
[1:33:38] five slaves would cost
[1:33:41] no he's not for sale
[1:33:44] well what makes him act like that
[1:33:47] he said what is it that makes him act
[1:33:49] like that is he the boss over the rest
[1:33:51] of them
[1:33:52] no
[1:33:54] he said maybe you feed him better than
[1:33:56] you do the rest of them
[1:33:57] no
[1:33:58] they all eat in the galley just just all
[1:34:00] together he said i don't feed him any
[1:34:02] different he's no balls he's just simply
[1:34:04] a slave
[1:34:05] well what makes him act different
[1:34:09] he said
[1:34:10] i didn't know for a while he said but
[1:34:11] you know i found out one day
[1:34:14] that his father is the king of a tribe
[1:34:16] in his homeland
[1:34:18] he said yet though he's a son an alien
[1:34:20] away from home he keeps the morale of
[1:34:23] the rest of them up for he knows he's a
[1:34:26] king's son
[1:34:30] let that sink in brother brown said oh i
[1:34:33] thought oh oh god he said though we've
[1:34:35] alieated here in a dark world amongst
[1:34:37] unbelief and skeptics and infidels and
[1:34:39] scoffers and laughter brother stick out
[1:34:42] your chest
[1:34:44] he said because we're sons and daughters
[1:34:46] of the king let's act like men and women
[1:34:49] of the kingdom of god though we're
[1:34:51] aliens let's act like sons and daughters
[1:34:54] of a king
[1:35:00] let me tell you
[1:35:02] if you've got the holy spirit leaning
[1:35:03] into your life and i'm about to finish
[1:35:05] if you've got the holy spirit leading
[1:35:07] you into your life you learn to talk a
[1:35:09] little bit
[1:35:11] the things you used to say the degrading
[1:35:13] words the dirty jokes the filthy
[1:35:16] comments you used to make the hurtful
[1:35:17] things you said to people you don't say
[1:35:19] those anymore you talk a little
[1:35:21] different you walk a little different if
[1:35:23] you're led by the holy spirit you walk a
[1:35:25] little different you're a little lighter
[1:35:27] in your feet now
[1:35:28] are you with me
[1:35:30] if you got the holy spirit let me tell
[1:35:32] you you worship a little different
[1:35:35] you don't sit out there just hum drum
[1:35:37] and and worshiping but if you've got the
[1:35:39] holy spirit you're led by the holy
[1:35:41] spirit your songs are songs sung a
[1:35:43] little different have you ever noticed
[1:35:44] when you go to the meetings and you hear
[1:35:46] and the holy ghost goes through meetings
[1:35:48] and through services and then anoints
[1:35:50] the musicians the fingers are just
[1:35:52] moving they don't know where their
[1:35:53] fingers are going they're just moving
[1:35:56] the singer seeing from a place that they
[1:35:58] that they normally wouldn't see what is
[1:36:00] this the holy spirit and the next thing
[1:36:02] you hear is screams across the
[1:36:04] auditorium why is that because they're
[1:36:06] people led by the spirit that know their
[1:36:09] sons and daughters of god and what god
[1:36:11] has brought them through
[1:36:21] the bible says they cry to have a father
[1:36:26] let me tell you my daddy conquered death
[1:36:27] hell in the grave
[1:36:32] my daddy calls the blind to see
[1:36:35] my daddy calls the death to hear
[1:36:37] my daddy calls lazarus to come forth out
[1:36:39] of the grave
[1:36:40] my daddy walked through the three hebrew
[1:36:43] children through the fiery furnace
[1:36:45] my daddy parted the red sea so the
[1:36:47] children could walk across without muddy
[1:36:49] feet
[1:36:50] my daddy let me tell you my daddy he led
[1:36:53] a shepherd boy to bring down a giant
[1:36:55] my daddy he fed 5 000 with two loaves
[1:36:58] and five fish five five loaves and two
[1:37:00] fish
[1:37:03] my daddy's the king of kings and the
[1:37:04] lord of lords who's yours
[1:37:07] who's yours
[1:37:09] what are we being led by tonight
[1:37:12] what are we being led by
[1:37:14] tonight
[1:37:16] you know sometimes i think we need a
[1:37:18] little wine
[1:37:20] thank you sister becky
[1:37:25] we need a little wine
[1:37:29] stimulation
[1:37:31] wine stimulates
[1:37:33] on the day of pentecost one of the most
[1:37:35] beautiful scenes in the bible the why
[1:37:37] they they say they come out and they
[1:37:39] were staggering and they were walking
[1:37:40] along and brother brown said even mary
[1:37:43] mother of jesus was staggering like a
[1:37:45] drunk woman
[1:37:47] why because they said they think they
[1:37:48] was under the influence of wine
[1:37:52] drunk on the spirit
[1:37:55] and brother brown said what the world
[1:37:56] needs today is an old-fashioned saint
[1:37:58] paul revival bible holy ghost back in
[1:38:01] the church
[1:38:02] and that's what's a matter with the
[1:38:03] church and that's the reason it's so
[1:38:05] formal and indifferent
[1:38:09] i hate to say this but i'm going to say
[1:38:11] it
[1:38:12] it's not in my notes it's just coming
[1:38:15] on the day of pentecost they walked out
[1:38:17] of the day of pentecost and they
[1:38:18] staggered like drunk people under the
[1:38:20] anointing of the holy ghost speaking in
[1:38:22] tongues
[1:38:24] that the people couldn't the people said
[1:38:25] how are those people speaking in that
[1:38:26] tongue that's not where they're from
[1:38:30] they were so anointed by god so anointed
[1:38:32] with the holy spirit and they staggered
[1:38:34] and people was in awe and said they're
[1:38:35] drunk
[1:38:37] and we walk out wondering when we're
[1:38:38] going to the next restaurant ball game
[1:38:42] volleyball game
[1:38:45] where's the next job
[1:38:46] what we're going to do we're going
[1:38:47] fishing today what are we going to do
[1:38:49] something's wrong
[1:38:55] something's wrong
[1:38:57] let that sink in
[1:38:59] stimulation
[1:39:01] we need the stimulation of wine in the
[1:39:04] holy ghost we need that stimulation
[1:39:06] but i tell you what
[1:39:08] i tell you i don't know if we can handle
[1:39:10] it
[1:39:15] i don't know if we can handle it
[1:39:19] you know jesus warned against putting
[1:39:21] new wine
[1:39:23] into old bottles
[1:39:28] now
[1:39:29] for some that's interpreted two
[1:39:30] different ways
[1:39:31] one is you can't bring law into grace
[1:39:36] but the way i look at it
[1:39:38] and the way it makes sense to me
[1:39:41] is you can't put wine in old starchy
[1:39:45] stiff
[1:39:48] dried up vessels
[1:39:51] because it can't hold it
[1:39:54] so as believers we got to find ourselves
[1:39:57] somehow to be able to soften up
[1:39:59] we got to be under the spirit of god to
[1:40:01] be softened up so that when that wine
[1:40:03] goes in there you know how wines made
[1:40:05] they crush up the grapes they stomp them
[1:40:07] in their feet they bring and sift all
[1:40:09] the juice put a little sugar put a
[1:40:10] little yeast in there and let it begin
[1:40:12] to ferment they pour it in those skins
[1:40:16] stopper on it
[1:40:20] well let me tell you if you're starchy
[1:40:23] cold on god dried up your hides brittle
[1:40:27] and fragile
[1:40:29] and that wine begins to bubble
[1:40:32] oh it begins to shake
[1:40:35] see we don't have enough we don't have
[1:40:36] enough bubble and shaking us
[1:40:40] you say well
[1:40:41] we're white folk i don't care what color
[1:40:43] you are
[1:40:45] there's nothing wrong with having a
[1:40:46] little little life about you
[1:40:50] and you'll find if you'll release
[1:40:51] yourself you'll find yourself that you
[1:40:53] enjoy god that you enjoy worship that
[1:40:56] you enjoy singing that you enjoy being a
[1:40:58] son and daughter of god because the
[1:41:00] blessings are numerous
[1:41:02] but if you put that wine in that old
[1:41:04] skin
[1:41:06] you lose it
[1:41:08] yeah
[1:41:08] it's gone
[1:41:12] how many wants pliable skin today
[1:41:15] pliable skin that the holy ghost can
[1:41:17] bear and can work in
[1:41:20] let's stand to our feet
[1:41:22] that's long enough i got three more
[1:41:23] pages but we'll shut her down
[1:41:26] it's wednesday night
[1:41:30] god's sure good to us
[1:41:34] i just want to be that vessel
[1:41:37] i want to be a vessel that god can move
[1:41:39] through that the conduit an open conduit
[1:41:42] that god flows through
[1:41:45] you know the spirit's typed in about
[1:41:47] three different ways it's water
[1:41:49] wine and fire
[1:41:52] think about it
[1:41:53] i want that
[1:41:54] water of life to flow freely through me
[1:41:57] i want the fire of god to make me move
[1:41:59] in such a way and make me make me so on
[1:42:01] fire for god
[1:42:05] and i want that stimulation
[1:42:07] of revelation of what it is to be full
[1:42:09] of the holy ghost
[1:42:11] i don't want anything in this world to
[1:42:12] hold me back i don't want any pleasure i
[1:42:16] don't want any any want any desire and
[1:42:18] that's hard because we're americans and
[1:42:20] we've got it easy even in this world we
[1:42:22] live in we've got it easy we we make we
[1:42:24] have we've got people's got good livings
[1:42:26] here and we see things we want things
[1:42:28] and we got to be careful
[1:42:31] because if you're not careful
[1:42:33] god's down here
[1:42:36] wants us up here
[1:42:39] you love the lord
[1:42:41] let's tonight bow our heads heavenly
[1:42:43] father
[1:42:44] we thank you lord jesus for the service
[1:42:46] tonight lord we thank you for your
[1:42:49] your holy spirit speaking to us and
[1:42:52] quickening the word to us lord i trust
[1:42:54] lord that somebody was helped by the
[1:42:56] service and
[1:42:57] somebody would be able to realize and
[1:42:59] identify who they really are and how the
[1:43:01] holy spirit moves because it's a
[1:43:03] question that many have how do i know
[1:43:05] i've got it lord i hope tonight they
[1:43:06] know
[1:43:07] by their fruits by their actions by
[1:43:10] their words by their thoughts by their
[1:43:11] desires
[1:43:13] that proves they've got the holy ghost
[1:43:15] because they love you lord
[1:43:18] they desire to be here lord they desire
[1:43:20] to be around your people lord there's a
[1:43:23] drawing in their life that pulls them
[1:43:24] close to you to come to you father
[1:43:28] and everything they want to do they want
[1:43:30] to put you first
[1:43:32] lord and if we fail you anyway lord and
[1:43:36] and we've got it on the wrong end of the
[1:43:37] spectrum and we've got you way
