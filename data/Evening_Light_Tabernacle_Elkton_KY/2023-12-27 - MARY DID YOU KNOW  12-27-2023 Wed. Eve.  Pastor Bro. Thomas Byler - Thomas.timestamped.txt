[1:10:10] thinking about all that Mary needed to
[1:10:12] know
[1:10:13] amen turn the other one off what is
[1:10:17] it check test test test check it test
[1:10:21] test test I'm I'm getting some here
[1:10:23] y'all hear
[1:10:26] it
[1:10:31] test I'm
[1:10:35] green well it's

[1:10:41] now amen and also we got some of that
[1:10:44] back so we thank Micah for getting that
[1:10:45] fixed I have not called them people
[1:10:48] about our fiber so tomorrow I'm calling

[1:11:08] brother Tommy had taken some pictures
[1:11:10] from up
[1:11:12] there amen did some video from up there
[1:11:14] so we're going to think about going up
[1:11:16] top because it's certainly gives a
[1:11:18] better view on the internet from back
[1:11:20] there and then they maybe have to just
[1:11:22] draw it in while the is preaching or
[1:11:24] something but it certainly look good but
[1:11:25] it'll be an option something that we
[1:11:27] look amen look to doing one more thing
[1:11:29] before we read the word and change the
[1:11:31] order service is
[1:11:33] um everybody needs to give me input Amen
[1:11:37] on our winter months I talked to Brother
[1:11:40] Steve about it with but for those who
[1:11:42] are working it may be a little hard but
[1:11:44] if you want to start service at 6:30
[1:11:46] during new winter month let me know amen
[1:11:50] and if we have enough and there's not
[1:11:52] anybody can say well I can't make that
[1:11:54] you know maybe we'll keep it like that
[1:11:55] but if you can make it by 6:30 that way
[1:11:57] we'd be out by 8:00 amen and so of
[1:12:00] course we know it's a dark by five so uh
[1:12:03] you know if you want to do that we will
[1:12:05] change the winter month I know the
[1:12:07] summer month amen we'll probably switch
[1:12:09] back but maybe we can have maybe we
[1:12:10] could do something like that amen I be
[1:12:12] okay with me amen but we want to think
[1:12:15] about those working and having jobs and
[1:12:17] stuff too so but I do need your input so
[1:12:20] please each family say yay or nay of

[1:12:54] of in the direction of a song that was
[1:12:56] wrote and what it meant and so forth and
[1:12:59] kind of feeling inspired to go a little
[1:13:01] further on it we ask God you'll just
[1:13:03] help us now Lord as we open your word
[1:13:05] father and Lord and look at it once
[1:13:07] again that your Holy Spirit would
[1:13:09] Quicken it to us father and that we go

[1:13:45] that's kind of a different title isn't
[1:13:47] it amen praise the
[1:13:49] Lord amen so we'll read and I think
[1:13:52] we'll go
[1:13:54] to
[1:13:56] um all the
[1:13:58] way over to let me see where we're
[1:14:02] at the
[1:14:04] crucifixion that is found in St
[1:14:07] Luke St
[1:14:10] Luke
[1:14:12] 23
[1:14:14] amen St Luke
[1:14:22] 1023
[1:14:25] and I didn't even really take the time
[1:14:27] to look up that song and some of the
[1:14:29] things but we know that he talked about
[1:14:31] him walking on the water and the
[1:14:33] different things that that uh
[1:14:36] amen verse 26 of chapter 23 of St Luke
[1:14:41] here we go backwards again and as they
[1:14:43] led him away they laid hold upon one
[1:14:45] Simon a serian coming out of the country
[1:14:49] and on him they laid a cross that he
[1:14:52] might bear it after Jesus and there
[1:14:54] followed him a great company of people
[1:14:56] and of women which also bewailed and
[1:14:59] lamented him but Jesus turning unto them
[1:15:01] said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for
[1:15:03] me but for yourselves and for your
[1:15:06] children for behold the days are coming
[1:15:08] into which they shall say blessed are
[1:15:10] the barren and the wombs and the that
[1:15:12] never bear and the PS which never gave
[1:15:14] suck and they shall begin to then shall
[1:15:16] they begin to say to the mountains fall
[1:15:18] on us and on the Hills cover us and if
[1:15:22] they do the things in the Green Tree
[1:15:23] what shall be done in the drive amen may
[1:15:28] God ask you blessings to the reading of
[1:15:30] the word
[1:15:36] Amen brother Bram in from that time in
[1:15:39] 1961 says now en closing the devil said
[1:15:43] that's not the Son of God he couldn't
[1:15:45] stand and let that spit hang on his face
[1:15:48] and as many times as he's told these
[1:15:50] things and so forth and predicted things
[1:15:53] they smack him on the head with a re and
[1:15:55] would prove that he was the son of was
[1:15:58] the son of God he isn't the Son of God
[1:16:01] so in closing let's take a little trip a
[1:16:03] mental trip now listen close let's go
[1:16:05] back to Jerusalem 1500 years ago it was
[1:16:07] strange and odd morning never was a
[1:16:10] morning like that morning the sun come
[1:16:12] up but it looked very strange something
[1:16:14] was going on wrong along about 9:00 they
[1:16:18] were standing in a room and I could hear
[1:16:20] a mob screaming screaming saying way
[1:16:22] with him away with him I see a little
[1:16:25] woman right out run out in front of the
[1:16:26] mouth and say what has he done tell me
[1:16:29] what has he done he's only healed your
[1:16:32] sick and brought hopes to the Hopeless
[1:16:34] what's he done to deserve this who's she
[1:16:37] talking about amen and I look behind and
[1:16:41] I hear something bump bump bump and
[1:16:42] here's an old ruged cross coming down

[1:17:48] stinging The Sting of death amen
[1:17:53] Amen Let me uh read you kind of the
[1:17:56] quote that come to my mind amen that led
[1:17:58] me to this Amen brother bam says it this
[1:18:01] way and he was talking about Christ
[1:18:03] Christmas and how that it was converted
[1:18:07] from Pagan Pagan the juper or the son
[1:18:10] God birthday to the son of God's
[1:18:12] birthday he says now Christianity was
[1:18:14] accepted in the way in Rome and they
[1:18:17] said that we'll make the same
[1:18:19] celebration we'll make son of make it
[1:18:22] the son of God God's birthday the son
[1:18:24] got Jupiter's birthday then the son of
[1:18:26] God's birthday around the 25th of
[1:18:29] December amen butam says now what
[1:18:32] difference does it make see today even
[1:18:34] if they was doing it in July or August
[1:18:37] or whatever it might be it's still the
[1:18:40] sacredness of remembering that God gave
[1:18:43] us hope that we have that have that we
[1:18:47] the hope that we have in US amen and now
[1:18:52] you say well the rest of them got all
[1:18:55] got a Santa Claus and going on like they
[1:18:57] do why don't we might as well join in
[1:18:59] and do it no sir no this is not and I
[1:19:02] like this now remember this engrave this
[1:19:05] into your hard drive no this is not a
[1:19:08] say Pagan celebration to
[1:19:11] us amen how many believes that Christmas
[1:19:14] for the believer is not a pagan
[1:19:19] celebration amen but it is a sacred hour
[1:19:23] he says if there had been no Christmas
[1:19:26] there would be no
[1:19:29] Resurrection if there was no Christmas
[1:19:31] there'd be no love there'd be no peace
[1:19:35] there'd be no Hereafter for the believer
[1:19:37] if there if it hadn't been for
[1:19:41] Christmas praise the Lord how many glad
[1:19:44] that there's a Christmas I read in the
[1:19:46] news this week where colon cap
[1:19:49] Kaepernick whatever how do you spell his
[1:19:51] name the one that started kneeling for
[1:19:53] the national anthem and it's that he
[1:19:56] wants to cancel
[1:19:58] Christmas and all the giving of
[1:20:01] gifts huh but you know I got to thinking
[1:20:05] you know how many knows that Christmas
[1:20:07] is something that's world
[1:20:09] over amen and I'm here to tell you it's
[1:20:12] about it's supposed to be about the
[1:20:14] birth of the Lord Jesus Christ people
[1:20:17] want to try to deny it but as long as
[1:20:19] they celebrate Christmas it still has to
[1:20:21] do and it still points them to a Son of
[1:20:24] God that was born very little boy amen
[1:20:29] praise the Lord amen I've got a few
[1:20:31] quotes here that I won't even really get
[1:20:33] into it but brother Benham many times
[1:20:35] and as you know brother benam taught
[1:20:37] that uh Jesus amen was not the son of
[1:20:42] Mary amen and even when he was in the
[1:20:44] cross he said
[1:20:47] woman he never said mother brother B he
[1:20:50] said he never called her mother he even
[1:20:51] says your mother
[1:20:53] is looking for you amen and what he say
[1:20:56] he says who is my mother but he that
[1:20:58] serves the Lord and so forth amen never
[1:21:00] called her mother because now we know
[1:21:02] brother Ben actually it was kind of a
[1:21:04] strong statement but he says that she
[1:21:06] was just the
[1:21:08] incubator now in the Bible many places
[1:21:10] he
[1:21:11] says mother mother of Jesus and so forth
[1:21:14] you know because naturally giving birth
[1:21:16] to him in that aspect it's important I
[1:21:18] believe that people understand that in
[1:21:20] that aspect it was his mother but as far
[1:21:23] as really being a part of
[1:21:27] her there was not one
[1:21:30] Speck so you know in that aspect she was
[1:21:32] not her mother Joseph was not because
[1:21:36] even when Mary and brother B says the
[1:21:38] the the uh the detail of the word
[1:21:44] correcting the air amen Jesus when the
[1:21:48] Mary come up to thy father and I you
[1:21:50] know or the mother and I we've been
[1:21:52] searching for you he never acknowledged
[1:21:55] that what they said was the truth is
[1:21:57] that right he says what who is my mother
[1:22:00] and so forth it was absolutely has to be
[1:22:03] be because if he' ever said
[1:22:05] mother hello if he'd ever called her
[1:22:08] mother huh think of what how that would
[1:22:11] have broke things brother in here talks
[1:22:14] about we're a mixed congregation and so
[1:22:16] forth but if the part of that it takes a
[1:22:19] man it takes genetics of the woman and
[1:22:22] it takes genetics of the man to actually
[1:22:24] make a baby isn't that right amen and if
[1:22:27] if if one side of it and even if it had
[1:22:29] been mother if it had been mother and it
[1:22:32] been the mother side there but says
[1:22:33] there would have been a sensation
[1:22:35] between God and Mary and God has no part
[1:22:38] of all that amen there's no kind of
[1:22:40] sensation whatsoever it was a gene amen
[1:22:43] it was created both parts were a spoken
[1:22:46] word
[1:22:48] creation of God in the womb of Mary
[1:22:53] Glory but you know Mary and I want you
[1:22:55] to understand this that and I want to go
[1:22:57] over perhaps a little bit try not to
[1:23:01] keep you past 10 10:30
[1:23:03] okay but look at look at this of Mary do
[1:23:06] you know and it's about knowing who this
[1:23:09] really
[1:23:11] is
[1:23:12] amen and you know I want to say in every
[1:23:16] age people don't know who he
[1:23:20] is they don't know who who Jesus is
[1:23:26] amen amen
[1:23:28] Mary from what I understand the
[1:23:30] scripture says you know that this child
[1:23:32] that you're going to have he said he's
[1:23:35] going to save his people from their
[1:23:39] sins so Mary knew that hey this is the
[1:23:42] Messiah he's going to come and he's
[1:23:44] going to save our people from their sins
[1:23:47] is that right but just how perhaps that
[1:23:50] that was going to happen she didn't
[1:23:55] understand she didn't understand because
[1:23:58] brother bam said in one of the uh I
[1:24:00] believe it was in one of the ancient
[1:24:01] writings that they was said amen that
[1:24:04] Mary went along up there because I
[1:24:06] couldn't find it in the Bible but went
[1:24:08] up there and he said he made that
[1:24:09] statement like he says what has he
[1:24:12] done and I I read that scriptures where
[1:24:15] a multitude of women multitud company of
[1:24:18] people and women bewailed and lamented
[1:24:20] him they were following him no doubt
[1:24:22] demonstrate said you know what's he done
[1:24:24] but good what's he done this out the
[1:24:28] other H not but you made gentlemen out
[1:24:32] of the men I made real ladies out of
[1:24:35] prostitutes look at he just nothing done
[1:24:37] but why do you do
[1:24:41] this amen so we say Mary did you know
[1:24:45] maybe Mary did you know that your boy is
[1:24:48] going to walk on water Mary did you know
[1:24:51] that the age of 12 he's going to perhaps
[1:24:53] dispute with the scribes and Pharisees
[1:24:54] and you're going to wonder where he is
[1:24:56] and he's going to tell you don't you
[1:24:57] know I must be about my father's
[1:25:01] business how many know he was about his
[1:25:03] father's business and it wasn't
[1:25:05] construction it wasn't
[1:25:08] carpentry oh my brother brother brother
[1:25:11] Tommy can you imagine if they had take
[1:25:13] the genetic test back then if they had
[1:25:16] been able to take a genetic test what
[1:25:19] the doctor by the GL what would he have
[1:25:21] said
[1:25:26] wow
[1:25:29] huh these this genetics he had to say is
[1:25:33] not of this
[1:25:35] world it's not of this
[1:25:38] world why because it was genetics of God
[1:25:42] it was God's blood if they tested his
[1:25:45] blood it was God's blood it wasn't a me
[1:25:47] it wasn't Jewish blood it wasn't Gentile
[1:25:49] blood it was God's very own blood
[1:25:56] oh
[1:25:57] my but you know maybe Mary didn't really
[1:26:00] understand and no doubt but if this was
[1:26:03] true and Mary was following she didn't
[1:26:05] as a mother she didn't want him to
[1:26:08] die nothing but good that he done and
[1:26:11] here he's gone to the
[1:26:13] Cross but Mary don't you know this is
[1:26:16] what I come
[1:26:18] for
[1:26:20] amen Mary doubt when he heard oh my
[1:26:23] there's 5,000 people his church is Big
[1:26:27] the multitudes are following him Mary no
[1:26:30] doubt was
[1:26:31] proud that's my
[1:26:33] son that's my
[1:26:36] boy
[1:26:39] amen she was
[1:26:41] human
[1:26:43] huh your father and I calling calling
[1:26:47] him her son did you my
[1:26:48] son
[1:26:51] huh that's right think about it 5,000 oh
[1:26:57] my when he got the news that he took
[1:26:59] five Lo and five fishes and fed 5,000
[1:27:03] woo his Fame is spreading all around how
[1:27:07] proud mom must have
[1:27:12] been you know I think about it like it
[1:27:14] today you know it had a big church but
[1:27:16] you know it's not about the size of your
[1:27:18] church not about the size of the group
[1:27:20] but it's what Christ is here
[1:27:23] for he's Bolding and he's shaping
[1:27:26] individuals into His Image getting them
[1:27:28] ready for heaven that's what he's really
[1:27:30] all about it's not about crowds and
[1:27:32] multitudes it's about the
[1:27:37] Lord
[1:27:41] amen
[1:27:43] my what if he wouldn't have come what if
[1:27:47] there be no
[1:27:48] Christmas there' be no
[1:27:50] salvation amen man Mary Don't You
[1:27:55] Know
[1:27:57] Mary following along saying what has he
[1:28:00] done Mary I want to say Mary Don't You
[1:28:03] Realize what's going to become of this
[1:28:06] that when he sheds his blood and when he
[1:28:08] dies he dies for the sins of the whole
[1:28:14] world oh my and they're going to get
[1:28:18] [Applause]
[1:28:19] forgiveness a lot of folks didn't
[1:28:21] understand I want to bring it to this
[1:28:22] day here at the end if I can Peter
[1:28:26] didn't
[1:28:27] understand they didn't understand what
[1:28:29] was was all about they thought maybe he
[1:28:32] was going to come and that he's going to
[1:28:33] restore the Kingdom of Israel back again
[1:28:36] at that
[1:28:37] time he's going to be the king huh
[1:28:40] you're going to drive the Romans out and
[1:28:42] all of this but it was contrary to what
[1:28:44] they thought they barely even
[1:28:46] knew who he
[1:28:49] was have I been with you this long and
[1:28:52] still you don't know

[1:28:55] disciples show us the father he keep
[1:28:58] talking about the father show it to us
[1:29:00] and it'll satisfy
[1:29:02] us
[1:29:05] amen oh my it's
[1:29:08] important that you know who he
[1:29:11] is if Mary could have seen the scope and
[1:29:14] if Mary would have understood the scope
[1:29:17] of what he was going to do she just
[1:29:20] stepped back and said to God be the
[1:29:24] glory there's going to be Millions set
[1:29:28] free there's going to be Millions healed
[1:29:31] the power of the enemy is going to be
[1:29:34] broke this is what my boy come to the
[1:29:37] world for was to

[1:29:43] [Applause]
[1:29:44] life amen for his children
[1:29:50] amen Peter
[1:29:53] oh
[1:29:54] my peter in 16th chapter of Matthew in
[1:29:57] verse 21 says and from that time forth
[1:30:00] Jesus began to show unto his disciples
[1:30:02] how that he must go into Jerusalem and
[1:30:04] suffer many things of the elders and the
[1:30:06] chief priests and the scribed and be
[1:30:09] killed bad
[1:30:12] news they didn't want to hear that kind
[1:30:14] of
[1:30:15] stuff and he be raised again the third
[1:30:17] day and Peter took him and began to
[1:30:19] rebuke him saying far be it from thee
[1:30:23] Lord this shall not be done unto
[1:30:27] thee Peter did you
[1:30:31] know Peter didn't
[1:30:34] know no that this man needed to go and
[1:30:40] be
[1:30:40] crucified he wanted him to stay
[1:30:44] there
[1:30:47] amen this shall not be done unto the but
[1:30:49] he turned and said to Peter get the
[1:30:52] behind me

[1:33:13] but Jesus said in the 16th chapter verse
[1:33:15] 13 when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:33:17] ciceria Philippi he asked his disciples

[1:34:09] today
[1:34:12] amen
[1:34:15] amen that's right who do you say that I
[1:34:17] say am some say thou art John the
[1:34:20] Baptist Eli as others Jeremiah one of
[1:34:23] the prophets Jesus said unless you
[1:34:25] believe that I am he to describes the
[1:34:27] Pharisees you're going to die in your
[1:34:31] sins know what he said Pharisees didn't
[1:34:34] know who he

[1:34:40] was do you know who he is do you realize
[1:34:43] who this
[1:34:45] is
[1:34:47] amen
[1:34:50] no
[1:34:57] how be
[1:35:00] it he says but we speak the wisdom of
[1:35:03] God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[1:35:05] which God ordained before the
[1:35:08] world unto our
[1:35:10] glory amen which none of the princes of
[1:35:15] this world knew for had they known it
[1:35:18] they would not have crucified the Lord
[1:35:20] of Glory
[1:35:26] amen remember P asked that pilot asked
[1:35:30] him he says he said art thou the king of
[1:35:33] the Jews and he answered and said unto
[1:35:35] him thou sayest it and the chief priest
[1:35:39] accused him of many things but he
[1:35:40] answered nothing and pilot asked him
[1:35:42] again say and said answerest thou
[1:35:44] nothing behold how many things they
[1:35:47] witness against they but Jesus yet they
[1:35:50] answering nothing so so pilate
[1:35:53] marveled amen and another one
[1:35:58] of gospels if you remember he says don't
[1:36:01] you realize I've got power to release

[1:36:28] was if he had really know who he was
[1:36:32] they wouldn't have crucified
[1:36:35] him let me say again in this
[1:36:39] hour how many beli that Jesus is
[1:36:41] identified brother preached the message
[1:36:43] God is identified by his characteristics
[1:36:46] brother BR had to come right out and
[1:36:48] explain it to the people hey you know hi
[1:36:50] whatever he did and however he acted
[1:36:52] back then if he acts like this back here
[1:36:55] now and I understand that's Jesus you'll
[1:36:58] understand him by his actions by his
[1:37:01] charactertics that's right but the
[1:37:04] churches even though Jesus come and use
[1:37:09] brother brandham deser the thoughts and
[1:37:11] intent of the
[1:37:12] heart didn't he preach a message who do
[1:37:14] you say this is who is this this
[1:37:18] generation did not know who he was
[1:37:22] aren't you glad that your eyes are open
[1:37:25] to understand who Jesus is that he is a
[1:37:28] manifestation of the word of
[1:37:32] [Applause]
[1:37:34] God that he's oh my talk about following
[1:37:38] a star they followed his star to Jesus
[1:37:41] how about today how many knows amen it
[1:37:44] is the seventh angel the star in his
[1:37:46] right
[1:37:48] hand but in the days of the voice of the
[1:37:50] SU Angel when he shall begin to time the
[1:37:52] mystery of God should be
[1:37:54] finished what did they
[1:37:57] do what brother M say the churches did
[1:38:00] to Jesus in this hour crucified him the
[1:38:03] second
[1:38:05] time put him
[1:38:07] out didn't know who he
[1:38:10] was because he came in such
[1:38:14] Simplicity through a prophet of God with
[1:38:17] his totes and hints and his Kentucky
[1:38:20] land
[1:38:21] AG they still didn't see
[1:38:24] him the the very Disciples of his had a
[1:38:28] hard time understanding and seeing who
[1:38:31] he really was Peter believed that he was
[1:38:33] the son of God is that right but he sure
[1:38:37] didn't want him to Die the way he was
[1:38:39] going to
[1:38:40] die you can only imagine none of us
[1:38:42] really understand the disappointment in
[1:38:44] all of the disciples when they all left
[1:38:46] Jesus when he was coming captured is
[1:38:47] that right the all Almighty were in
[1:38:50] bitterness the whole thing so to speak
[1:38:52] fell
[1:38:57] apart it's sad is it thinking about
[1:39:00] Peter his right-hand man a't that right
[1:39:03] had the Revelation but yet Jesus said
[1:39:05] you're going to deny me three
[1:39:07] times no you're going to deny me Thrice
[1:39:11] before that grows three times he
[1:39:13] denied him Jesus was there by
[1:39:16] himself oh my Mary didn't you know that
[1:39:20] he was going to die
[1:39:22] a horrible death a death you didn't even
[1:39:25] want a death you didn't like not what
[1:39:27] you was
[1:39:29] expecting
[1:39:32] amen but what a glorious thing it
[1:39:35] was what a glorious thing it was when he
[1:39:38] raised Lazarus man did you know that
[1:39:40] even Lazarus after being dead four
[1:39:43] days huh he brought him from the
[1:39:49] dead wow how wonderful is that
[1:39:55] right walk on
[1:40:00] water feed
[1:40:02] 5,000 cleanse the
[1:40:05] lepers is that right heal the sick raise
[1:40:09] the
[1:40:10] dead but that wasn't his primary
[1:40:16] purpose didn't even but Braham say that
[1:40:19] healing is a minor
[1:40:21] healing is a minor it's the bait on the
[1:40:23] hook that catches the
[1:40:26] fish
[1:40:28] what God did a miracle for this person
[1:40:31] God did a miracle for that
[1:40:33] person brother Tom is supposed to
[1:40:35] attract people's attention
[1:40:39] wow
[1:40:40] sure but the objective is what that soul
[1:40:45] on in there salvation is a
[1:40:48] major how many beli the saving of your
[1:40:51] soul is a major not a minor the purpose
[1:40:55] is that we might see and know who he
[1:41:00] is amen aren't you glad you know God
[1:41:05] opened up your eyes to who he
[1:41:09] is they didn't want to go but Jesus said
[1:41:12] it's expedient it's necessary my
[1:41:16] disciples it's needful that I go
[1:41:19] away
[1:41:23] even he told pilot for this purpose have
[1:41:25] I come
[1:41:27] amen oh man can you
[1:41:30] imagine now no doubt but when he comes
[1:41:33] the second time brother Tommy he's going
[1:41:35] to come with all the legions of
[1:41:40] angels I don't know about you better
[1:41:42] Glenn but I'm looking for him to come in
[1:41:45] clouds of
[1:41:49] Glory
[1:41:51] call me stupid because I I believe Jesus
[1:41:53] came in this generation he's already
[1:41:55] come and manifested himself like never
[1:41:58] before and proved himself alive and real
[1:42:01] but that does not take away from the
[1:42:02] literal coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:05] I hope in 2024 that we get to see those
[1:42:08] Clouds Of Glory he says they were
[1:42:10] looking up disciples in Acts and said
[1:42:12] they were looking in the heaven they was
[1:42:14] gazing in the heaven the angel said why
[1:42:16] are you standing gazing here he'd have
[1:42:19] to tell me twice why are you gazing cuz
[1:42:21] I would gaze till I couldn't gaze no
[1:42:24] more a sight like that to see him go
[1:42:27] into
[1:42:28] heaven I wouldn't turn my head would you
[1:42:31] I wouldn't be turning my head say well
[1:42:33] that ain't no but the point was but the
[1:42:37] way he they said as you have seen him go
[1:42:40] he will come
[1:42:41] again and we're going to meet him over
[1:42:45] there Mary did you know that if he dies
[1:42:48] and he purchas the ball all of these
[1:42:51] Saints one of these days amen there's
[1:42:53] going to be a resurrection but the B
[1:42:55] says man there's no Resurrection there's
[1:42:57] no going home there's no place over
[1:43:00] there if there's no
[1:43:04] Christmas aren't you glad he
[1:43:07] came if you don't go to the Cross if you
[1:43:09] dump
[1:43:11] High fight that great battle Mar did you
[1:43:15] know he would conquer every devil that
[1:43:17] comes in front of him in his
[1:43:19] lifetime
[1:43:22] but did you not know
[1:43:25] Mary that when you heard those
[1:43:27] cobblestone streets going bump bump bump
[1:43:31] bump bump bum he
[1:43:35] was over those cobblestones dragon that
[1:43:39] bump bloody seemed like an ordinary
[1:43:43] morning but yet a horrible horrible
[1:43:46] morning it seemed like people were going
[1:43:49] to die today people going to get stuck
[1:43:52] on a post hands driven Nails throw feet
[1:43:56] pierced through and hang there till they
[1:43:59] die a horrible death from what to
[1:44:01] understand it's a horrible
[1:44:03] death so it wasn't joyful it was a
[1:44:06] sorrowful
[1:44:09] thing was a sorrowful
[1:44:11] thing but it was going to be a lot of
[1:44:14] Joy it was going to bring a lot of
[1:44:18] Joy all of that sadness was going to
[1:44:21] bring
[1:44:22] joy
[1:44:24] amen it's going to bring
[1:44:27] happiness
[1:44:29] woo it's going to bring
[1:44:31] freedom it's going to break
[1:44:34] Chains It's going to spoil
[1:44:37] principalities and
[1:44:40] Powers his greatest battle wasn't
[1:44:43] raising
[1:44:45] life from the dead his greatest battle
[1:44:47] wasn't the epileptic child he was now
[1:44:49] facing his greatest battle but said the
[1:44:52] greatest battle was in The Garden of
[1:44:54] Gethsemane it was even hard for Jesus if
[1:44:57] it be possible at this pass pass from me
[1:45:00] nevertheless now I will but I'm going to
[1:45:02] do this and we're going to overcome this
[1:45:07] deviling the devil didn't even realize
[1:45:10] what was going on huh he didn't even
[1:45:13] know he says I'll get this guy he ain't

[1:45:27] the stinger took out of him a't that
[1:45:29] right and it was hard it was hard for
[1:45:32] Jesus perhaps it was very hurtful very
[1:45:36] painful every stripe on his back until
[1:45:38] you could see his
[1:45:40] ribs spit in his face crowns of thorns

[1:58:03] died to
[1:58:05] living He gave up everything he died for
[1:58:09] you and for me least we can do is give
