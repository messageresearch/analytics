TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we will read till um verse 20 a false balance is abomination to the Lord but a just weight is his Delight the Integrity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness when a wicked man dieth his expectation Shall Perish and the hope of unjust men perisheth an hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbor but through knowledge shall the just be delivered by the blessing of the upright the city is exalted but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked a tail Bearer reveal Secrets but he that is a a faithful Spirit conceal the matter he that is charity for a stranger shall smart for it and he that hateth ship is sure the merciful man doeth good to his own soul but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh as righteousness tendeth to life so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death this one together they that are of a frowed heart are Abomination to the Lord but such as are upright in their way are his Delight morning brothers and sisters I'll try not to move this around a whole bunch I was just uh thinking about what they had on the board back there about Nebuchadnezzar you know just a a gentile King that God was working with sometimes when you when you read his whole life and all that he went through that God put him through and what he did to other nations but he still worked with a gentile King it's amazing what God can do if whether you're a vessel of Wrath or a vessel of Grace God's still going to use you our hope as Christians is that we stay as Christians and God uses us as a vessel of Grace uh I was and reading in that that Psalm I mean after reading those 20 verses if that's exactly what we need as Believers this morning we have to have these verses have to be in our hearts and lives this morning if these aren't working the way out of you and this isn't how you're dealing with the people that surround you then there's something wrong but I was uh listening to a message this morning and this wasn't the scripture but I was if you turn with me to Deuteronomy the 29th chapter but I was also listening and uh this last verse in this chapter speaks volumes for where we're at you know the world is coming to an end here quicker than we thought it would you know ministers will come up and they'll tell you it's a late hour and there's something that's going to happen in our hearts and lives when you hear that you're either going to get worse or you're going to get better you're either going to believe it or you're not going to believe it either you're going to act on it or you're not going to act there's and you know and that's what Deuteronomy is there's a negative and a positive to everything we choose to do or everything we choose not to do in our hearts and lives but I'll I'm going to jump around until I get to the 29th verse and we know that it's a the Deuteronomy is a book of contrast a b Book of Life or a book of death and as an individual as a as a tribes and as a nation Israel had to either choose the right way or the Long Way well it's no different for us this morning you either have to choose the right way or the wrong way I I hope I don't read this whole chapter but um but starting at the ninth verse of the 29th chapter of Deuteronomy I find myself if I just read God's word then I'll only say what God's word has to say I used to listen to a preacher every morning when I used to drive on post uh and he was one of the one of those people that would read a verse and then talk about that verse but not change the verse he would just say what the verse has to say and I find that if you read a verse and you study the verse and move to the next one you'll find yourself being grounded in the word of God but I'll read the ninth verse keep therefore the words of the Covenant and do them that you may prosper and all that you do and I mean that's pretty simple there he goes on to say ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God your captains your tribes your elders your officers with all the man of Israel so it's you're just as important as a father of a family as the preacher of the church you all stand before the god responsible for who God gives you care of and he goes on to say here your little ones and your wives The Strangers that is in thy Camp from the ureer of the wood onto the drawer of thy water that thou th should US enter into a covenant with the Lord thy God into his oath which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day that he may establish thee to a day for a people unto himself that he may be unto thee a God he ha sent unto thee as he has sworn unto thy fathers Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob and then I'm going to stop there I'll wind up reading the whole chapter then I'm going to jump into the uh about the 22nd verse and finish at this last verse and it says here so that at the 22nd verse it says here so that the generations to come of you children that shall rise up after you and the strangers that shall come from AAR land shall say when they see the plagues so this is they' chose if they choose the opposite this is what it's saying here they shall see the plagues of the land and the sickness which the Lord hath laid upon it and and that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burning that is not sewn nor bre or any grass that groweth therein like overthrow of Sodom and gomorra forgive my pronunciations of these words Adema and zeum which the Lord overthrew in his anger and his wrath so this is another contrast this is a bad cont a dark contrast here even all the in nation shall say wherefore hath the Lord done this onto this land what meanthis heat of this great anger and we know what this means that they chose the wrong way that man shall say because they have forsake and this is what's really and this this speaks to our nation it speaks to you as an indiv or me as an individual or any country or any place in the world this it's no different you know um God dealt with the children of Israel for so many years he's dealt with the Gentile church so many years but you reap and you sell you can't get you can't get away from those Prin principles they're going to apply to you as an individual they're going to apply to you as a family they're going to apply to you as a church or as a nation you can't get away from those simple principles and I lost my place but I'll and it's the 24th verse even all these nations shall say wherefore hath the Lord done this unto this land what meaneth the heat of this great anger then men shall say because they have forsaken the Covenant of the Lord God their fathers which he had made with them he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt well I can take I'm not going to take you can look at this scripture and it's no different for us you have the whole gospel presented before you and it's no different for us this morning you it's got to change your heart in your life just like it had to do theirs and he goes on to say for they went and served other gods and worshiped them Gods whom they need not and whom they have not given unto them and it's no different than our what you know they were worshiping they didn't have the information age that we have this morning but where they were just worshiping dead dumb Idols well it's no different today whatever you spend the most time doing I I found in my own life whatever you find yourself defaulting to what you want to do the most when no one's looking that pretty much gives you a good sign or a good example of who you really are and I don't know anyone here but I just know know for myself if I find myself doing something too much then I know that I'm off the mark and I need to come back to the center line and he goes on to say here and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the land to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book and the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger and in Wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land as it is of this day but I was just thinking about this scripture this morning as I read it and brother brandham preached about this scripture right the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us I'm be stop there that's no different for us this morning this message of the hour we all truly believe and trust it's no different for us this morning I know I try not to repeat myself that secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us to our children forever that you may do all the words of the law well I I don't I was thinking this morning it's no different for us the whole message of the hour is before you all the secret things that have been revealed all you're responsible for this morning or all I'm responsible for is the word of God that's been presented to me in the age that I live in this morning and all I'm responsible for is fulfilling that word in my life and in my heart this morning and that's the only thing that matters and it's the same thing that Moses told the children of Israel this that I'm reading right here these things these blessings that come from the message of the hour that come from the word of God they're yours this morning anything that you have need of this morning any word I was listening to that message this morning and he was you know he was going from the end of I'm trying not to drop this mic closes up I was about to say something I say it a lot I wasn't going to say it but that's I was listening to to that message this morning and as he finished presenting the word of God I forget what message it was he got done and then he took and then you you used to you'll hear this a lot where he says he where brother Bram as a minister prays and takes full control over every Spirit everything that's going on in that assembly so that he can exercise that gift on the hearts of the people and I and what was striking is that soon as he does that he starts revealing the what lays in the hearts of the people and I was saying to myself that's what we need this morning where the spirit of God can speak to our hearts and this morning that we take full control over our families over our our group together where God can deal with us as individuals this morning you know that presence is here for us this morning I I'm just going to stop with this simple point the world out there is just a crazy place I I don't even like talking about it a whole bunch because it's just crazy it's it has totally gone off the edge and it's like I said before it's just like a rocket shooting in the air you know it just it accelerates and accelerates and accelerates and once it gets in space there's no resistance there's no no gravity anymore so it just accelerates and that's where we're at this morning it's just accelerating and there's no stopping it so it just lets me know as a Believer instead of going that way I need to go the other way and I need to get closer to him I need to get closer to Jesus Christ this morning so I'm ready on that day I hope that the only thing I have a hope for in this life is that God will come touch my heart make me a better Christian tomorrow than I was today that's the only thing that matters in this life that we live Brother David amen you love him this morning I guess my mic's not on do you love him this morning amen let's stand this morning and I enjoyed that

again for the opportunity to to stand before you um the last time I thank you musicians the last time I was here he uh he kind of gave me what I would call a backhanded compliment I believe that's the the right word I think he said uh he wasn't expecting it to be that good and uh you know what was really funny about that brother B I don't know if I told you this but the first time I ministered at our church our pastor brother Nathan got up and he said uh I was expecting it to be good but not that good so I was the second backhanded compliment that I've gotten but uh but that's okay um if you have your bibles if we could turn to uh we're going to turn to John uh one we're going to read John 1 through three we're going to read a little bit of scripture here so you might be standing for just a few minutes and um so get comfortable for a minute here all right I like that so John John 1 we're going to read one to three in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made all things were made or created by God everything yeah there's never been anything put on this Earth or put in this atmosphere anything ever that was not created by by God things have been perverted but nothing has been created unless it was by God life was only given by God everything that lives was because God gave it life even Cain the the the one from the evil one brother Brown said even Cain life came from God all things were created all things that live were made by god let's turn to Genesis 1 we're going to read 27-31 and then we're going to jump right on into Genesis 2 and we're going to read 1: 3 if you're there say Amen all right so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which which is upon the face of all the Earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of the tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and every beast of the earth and every foul of the air and everything that creepeth upon the Earth where wherein there is life I have given every green herb for meat and it was so and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day keep going right on over into two 1 to three thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it because that in because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made now think about this for a minute God created everything on the earth in this time this was not easy this was this was hard work I mean I I don't know how this was for God but I know he rested after he got done do you think about what he did here the details in which he has just performed he didn't just put a tree I don't believe that there was ever a time where God put a tree over here and said now I like it better over here he put that tree specifically there for a reason that may been thousands of years from the time that he put that tree there but that tree was there for a reason maybe that tree is going to fall over and it's going to rot and some ants are going to start building a colony in that tree because there's going to be a an animal brother Tommy that I don't even know what it's for but an ante eater is going to come along and it's going to need something to eat and those little litty bitty ants that this ante eater eats are going to be there because that tree was there he doesn't miss a detail all the way down through your life every person that you were ever going to need to come in contact with every this church right here was in the mind of God before the foundation of the Earth every detail he doesn't miss a one let's go to Joshua 10 we're going to read 12 to 14 we there okay Joshua 10 we're going to read 12-4 then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel son stand thou still upon gibian and thou moon in the valley of aelon and the sun Stood Still and the moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the sun Stood Still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man the Lord fought for Israel what's going on right here here is that gibian is under attack from five other countries five other kings have come together to attack this Ally of the children of Israel and the sun's starting to go down it's get starting to get dark and they know that if the sun goes down these men are going to have the opportunity to regroup they're going to be able to retreat they're going to regroup this battle is going to continue to the next day if something something doesn't happen this wasn't just a little Skirmish this was a battle and they needed it to end then so Joshua commands the sun to stand still the moon to stop moving and God the creator of everything hearkened hearkened means he listened he listened to the voice of a man and he stopped everything from moving for almost a day let's pray dear heavenly father Lord It's always such a wonderful and an awesome opportunity father to come into your house Lord to stand before uh uh your people father your your sons and daughters Lord Lord God I pray father that uh you would just move in here Lord in a special way father Lord I just pray you would would anoint me father to say what you would have me say Lord Lord I pray that you would just anoint each person here father Lord I pray that it would be a blessing to them Father the words that you you you're having me Speak Lord I pray it would be an encouragement to them I pray that uh that each one father would just with anything that they would have need of Lord just would be on their heart as as we would be taking this little text father and and that that it would just just do something for them Lord Lord I pray that you just be in the service father have your way father let everything that's said and done be pleasing to you Lord we love you and we just thank you for all that you do for us in Jesus name I pray amen you can be seated thank you so as we're going through this I would like for you if you if you have something on your heart to hold it on your heart this morning and and and think about this as we're as we're as we're going through this little this little text the uh titled to my sermon is little Lazarus and I'm going to tell you right now we're going to take a few left turns and a few right turns okay so you're probably going to be wondering here in a little bit where in the world I'm going with this but with the help of the Lord this is all going to make sense um so if anybody gets confused at any point raise your hand and we'll we'll back up and figure it out but I'm going to start off by telling you guys a story and uh this has been a little while back I was on a um a trip with a a good friend of mine and uh it was a a trip he was preaching um at another church and I went with him and as I'm sitting there and I'm listening to him preach and he's he's more of a teacher but as I'm as I'm listening to this and uh man he's he's just taking he's just taking the the the Bible and he's just diving deep into it and he's he's he's he's saying things that just like I mean me sitting there I mean they're just like wow I've never thought of this that way I've never I've never thought of this and this and and I mean he's just really just doing a great job and I start sitting there and the devil he starts tapping me on the shoulder saying what does he need you for if he's got men like this what does he need you for and so I start questioning my Ministry because I'm wondering the same thing if he's got men that can preach like this this man's a teacher I'm an evangelist you know Lord if if you're gonna you're G to lay a thought on my heart and you're wanting me to express it well don't just lay it on his heart and let him express it cuz he's better at than me and then I can just sit out here this whole Ministry thing can go away and my wife said yes so I'm just thinking what do you need me for and so I'm I I start dealing with this and I feel that he's called me to preach but I'm trying to figure out you know why does he need me and as a Son of God and I do believe that I'm a Son of God what can you use me for what can what can I do for you and so I did something here and I started I started seeking after a sign now before everybody panics because we're not supposed to seek after signs right we're gonna we're gonna kind of talk about this for just a minute because there's there's two two different types of people that seek after a sign I was at at lunch with another Minister that I didn't know that well not too long ago and I started telling him about this and I I didn't know if he was going to kill over you know from a heart attack or if he was going to choke to death on his food because all of a sudden I'm not a Believer because I'm seeking a sign you know that's that's a big problem but there's two different types of people that seek after a sign see there's an a non-believer somebody that will say if you'll do this for me Lord show me a miracle show me if you'll if you'll take my my mother that's dying of cancer and you'll heal her then I'll believe this that's a non-believer see they don't believe they're looking for something to make them to believe this but a Believer that's looking for a sign a Believer if you're a Believer you already believe this and if you believe this what you're looking for is the Vindication I already believe this I'm not I'm not asking you to do this so I will believe it I'm asking you to do it because I do believe it I want to see this in my life I want to see this in action that's the difference between a Believer and a non-believer somebody looking for a sign I'm going dig into this just a little bit deeper here and we're going to go into uh uh I'm going to look at Matthew 16 I'm going to read 1 to4 the Pharisees also with the Sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from Heaven he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather uh foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering oh ye Hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky but cannot but can ye not discern the signs of the time a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of prophet Jonas and he left him and departed they were asking him for a sign to prove who he was he'd given so he'd given multiple signs to them but they were non-believers it did not matter what sign or how many signs he gave them they were never going to believe they were nonbelievers so a wicked and evil people you are seeking after his sign and I love I really liked his answer too because he he talks about you can walk catch this you can walk out of your house in the morning and you can look up in the sky and ju you've got the knowledge up here to look up here and go today' be a great day for a picnic or no today I'm going to stay home because I can see the way this looks there's there's rain coming you've got something up here but when it comes Discerning the time the the the times of of of now Discerning the times there's nothing in here for you to discern so you're constantly asking let me see a sign let me see a sign but he wasn't going to show them any more signs I'm going to read Matthew 12: 38-42 then certain of the scribes and the Pharisees answered saying Master we would we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas so again I'm not giving you any more signs you I've given you signs you don't believe you're never going to believe I'm not going to just I'm not going to be a clown for you I believe is the way brother brandham put it not God's not a clown I'm going to keep reading for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the Well's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas's here the queen of the South shall rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here so so my question would be is why are these people going to rise up with this generation and judge them Jonah and the queen of the South or I'm sorry the men of Nineveh and the queen of the South why are they going to rise up in judgment well it's because they saw a sign one sign and they believed brother Bram talks about this fish swims up to the the the banks of this this this of the the the beach there opens its mouth out and this Prophet walks out of this fish the men of Nineveh they look at this this that was one sign but then it says he preached to them and they believed it didn't say that he performed Miracles there was not another sign given one sign but they believed because they were Believers the queen of the South brother Brown I believe said that she rode for three months on a camel to get to Solomon because she'd heard something that was going on there and then when she gets to him and brother Brown talks about the gift that Solon have the gift of discernment when she saw this gift one time she believed it changed her life forever one sign she didn't need to stay there and and and keep asking let me see another one let me see you do that again heal this one heal this one let me see another one no one because she was a Believer the difference between a Believer wanting to see a sign and a non-believer there's a big difference there so there I was as a Believer looking for a sign I believed this word I believ this and I believe this with all of my heart I know this is the truth and I wanted to see I wanted something that nobody could explain away that's what I was looking for you guys have heard my testimony I know that that was him that intervened in my life for me there is no other explanation for that and I think that you guys believe the same thing because I believe you're Believers but if I'm sitting in front of a atheist psychologist could he explain that away sure he could he could explain using some sort of psychology as to why I did this or that or whatever he could explain it away I was healed of migraines that I had for 30 years I know that I was healed by him of migraines that I had for 30 years I know that because I'm I'm a Believer because I believe what's what's here but if I'm sitting in front of a a aist doctor could he explain it away of course he could he could come up with some sort of a reason why that happened I wanted something that nobody could explain and why did I want it it wasn't just for my sake it was for your sake Jesus standing in front at at the at the tomb of Lazarus when he's praying Lord I know that you hear me and I know that you always hear me but for their sake so that they will know that you sent me I wanted something just you can't explain it let me see let give me something so that that I know that I'm I'm I'm in your will here I I'm doing what you're wanting me to do so here I am looking for this sign whether you'll give it to me or not Lord I'm still going to believe this word because I'm a Believer so it doesn't matter whether you give this sign to me or not I'm still going to be a believer because I'm a Believer but you called me to the ministry I didn't ask for this you called me and I'm looking for something I'm looking for something that you can give me that I know without a doubt so as I'm dealing with this and Satan's really starting to beat me up about this brother was you able to get that picture this little guy comes along as I'm dealing with this if we can get it up there I don't know if we can or not if not I can get it up on here and I can give them just a minute so this little guy that I'm talking about is a little bunny and I got to give a little backstory to where I'm going with this because we're taking a a detour here so this little bunny comes along and we're getting close it's flashing uh this little bunny comes along and and previously to this bunny that that that they're they're trying to get the picture up um I was uh building a deck I think I told you guys I'm I'm a contractor and I was building a deck and while we were building this deck we uncovered a nest of bunnies and this little um Nest had had four bunnies in it and I took a board and I laid it across the nest because I didn't want anything to happen to him I thought well maybe mom's still around whatever she'll come back so um we work all day long on the deck I don't see mom anywhere the whole time so I had taken a little video of it and I kind of was petting one of the the little bunnies and and my youngest daughter she flips out man she wants the bunnies and so I'm sitting there thinking well I got you know a couple choices here really I can either leave them here and it was still cold outside and I was like I can leave them here and they're they're probably either going to starve to death or they're going to die you know of from freezing to death um or I could put them in a box and I mean they were little bitty guys or I can put them in a box and I can take them home and you know take their we can take the chances of of she can actually keep them alive so there's like a you take a a little bunny out of its its nest um it has about a 10% chance of survival so I took them I put them in a little box that I had and I took them home with me my daughter's flipping out and so my daughter uh she names them and she starts feeding these little bunnies and she went and the the the the pet people said hey get cat formula so she was literally putting the the formula in her hand and letting them eat out of her hand and she would have to bring them over there and she got them to the point where they were doing that good and then she started bottle feeding them and they started thriving all four of them which was was amazing and two weeks later now they're eating grass uh I mean they're running around they're just having a good time and two weeks later this bunny here that they're trying to get up on the screen shows up and and how this one came about was a friend of my daughters uh they live kind of on a farm and I guess the lawnmower had run over a nest and this was the only only one that survived so she called my my my daughter because she knew she had some other bunnies and was like Hey you want another one and Lena of course was like yeah I'll take it you know and so she takes this one and well she names this bunny Lazarus and uh um and so as she starts to basically do the same thing with this one that she had with the with the other four and uh it starts doing pretty good it starts eating a little bit and it's it's it's doing good and it's you know much smaller than the other ones but one day it it starts getting sick and we didn't know why couldn't figure out what was going on with this thing so I just took the little guy I'm already dealing with this whole Ministry thing and I took the little guy put him in my hands and I just prayed and my prayer was more than anything of Lord this thing does not have a soul it does not matter if this thing lives or dies it makes no difference whatsoever from what I can tell the only reason that bunnies exist are food for other animals they have no reason there's I mean what what what do they do for you nothing other than food that's what they you know they have babies constantly you know they they they they they just there's tons of them you know if something's not eating them you're going to get overran by bunnies so it's like will you let this thing live just because I'm asking you to do it going back to because I believe this and your word says because I care you care ask anything in my name and you'll have it so I'm asking you will you let this little guy live just because I'm asking you to well a few days later he dies there he is few days later he dies now he was only about this big and I'm thinking why what difference did it make Lord I've I I've got enough Faith to where I've been healed of migraines I've been healed of back pain instantly more than once you know I I know I have faith why couldn't this little guy live when he's he's meaningless it was just because a son of yours was asking you will you let him live and then he dies and I found out that he died because my wife had text me and it was on a Thursday I was actually at work and so I'm she text me this and I'm like man you got to be kidding me and it was just like you know things were just kind of starting to pile up on me a little bit I'm questioning my Ministry Satan just beating me up over that I'm asking Lord will you let me see something here hoping maybe it would you know maybe this right here well and then this guy dies and I it's just it's a it's a a bunny that means nothing why and so so I'm starting to to these things I mean he's he's you know Satan's now he's beating up on me good then I start to think this bunny right here the other four that my daughter got and named she named them Thumper Peter common name for money uh Theo and Jack nothing biblical why did did this one get named Lazarus and she calls me on a Thursday when he died he died on a Thursday and I start thinking Thursday how many days was it in the Bible that Lazarus was raised from the dead four days what's four days from Sunday four days from Thursday Sunday right Resurrection Day and then I kid you not that same day I'm listening to a tape and brother brandham starts talking about preach the gospel to Every Creature it didn't say every person it didn't say every man it said preach the gospel to every creature and I'm going to read that quote here in a few minutes but brother brandham said the word of God will take effect upon every creature so I just hear this quote and I'm thinking May maybe this is what I'm looking for I'm starting to get excited so I come home and I take little Lazarus and I put him in a little box and I take my prayer cloth that I keep in this Bible and I laid it over top of little Lazarus and this is on a Thursday evening Sarah's asking you know what what are you going to do with him I said just I'm GNA put him down here in my office leave him there and I start preparing now you guys have heard my testimony in thought I was nuts now you're really going to think I'm crazy I start preparing a sermon to preach on Sunday morning to a dead bunny because his word says preach the gospel to Every Creature so I start preparing this sermon sermon Sunday morning rolls around something wakes me up earlier than normal I look over at the clock and I mean I'm an hour and a half earlier than what I even need to get up or what I would even normally get up brother Tommy I go ahead and I get up I get ready I put on my suit I'm ready for church and I go and I get little Lazarus and I take my Bible I get my iPad I go outside there's a porch on the side of our house and I go outside I take little Lazarus and I set him on a little stand I open my bible on my iPad and I start preaching a c it was a beautiful day out Sun was shining nice breeze blowing I mean it was perfect and I was excited because this was the moment that I was looking for I'm not going to go through the whole sermon I am going to read you though the scriptures and the quotes that I read during that sermon and I titled titled that sermon Lazarus which just so happens to mean God has helped so I went to Philippians 4:6 be careful for not be careful for nothing but in everything be but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God John 15:7 if ye abide in me and my words abide in in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you James 4:2 ye lust and have not ye kill and kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and War yet ye have not because ye ask not John 16:24 hither to have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full Romans 8:38-39 for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate is from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord Proverbs 12:10 a righteous man regardeth the life of of his beast but The Tender Mercies of the wicked are cruel Luke 126 are not five sparrows sold for two farlings and not one of them is forgotten before God first Peter 5:7 casting all your care upon him for he carth for you Matthew 1030 and 31 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered for he for ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me 1965 definitive identifications of the Church the true church chur of the Living God here's the quote how many knows what the gospel is not the word Paul said the go Paul said the gospel come to us not in word only but through the power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost the gospel is the power of God to make the word act what it is what it says it'll do preach the gospel all the word all the world preach the gospel to just the white people or just the brown yellow black to every creature amen Every Creature you believe that means that I seen G God baffle a bull one day I seen him cause Hornets not to sting I seen him raise up AUM that has been laying dead all night every creature the gospel will take effect upon anything that you ask you say that's wrong brother Bram it's not wrong Church age book program of church age there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man John 11:11 these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep John 11:23 Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again John 11:25 and 26 Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this John 11:40 Jesus saith unto her said I said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should us see the glory of God John 11:41 and44 in closing on this little sermon that I I did then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou Hast heard me and I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou Hast sent me and when he thus had spoke he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave cloth and his face was bound about with a napkin Jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go I preached that sermon to a dead Bunny and then I took my Bible I put it in my hand I took little Lazarus out of the box and I laid him right here on my Bible and I took the prayer cloth and laid it on top of him I wasn't playing a game I believe this word I believe he sent us a prophet and I believe the words of that Prophet I laid little Lazarus right here on the Bible and I put my hand over him and I started to sincerely pray and as I prayed with all expectation because this was the moment I was looking for and as I ended my prayer and I pulled my hand away and I want you guys to hold on to that thought remember where we're at in that story we're going to come back to that we're going to take a little turn here you guys still with me everybody's still with me okay so about eight years ago or so me and my wife we took a vacation to Jamaica this was before this was right before we started coming back to church while we were on this vacation in Jamaica we were staying at a resort and we were going to take an an Excursion that day where they take you out and show you some sites or whatever so us and all these other people get on this bus and this lady uh Jamaican lady real heavy Jamaican accent she's kind of like the guide that she starts to talk and tell us where we're going to go and all these things as the bus starts to pull away a lady in the back from our Resorts yells up and says wait wait wait I got a problem she's like I left something in the room I have to have it I don't remember it was medication I don't know what it was they stopped the bus she gets off she runs she grabs whatever it needs she gets back on the bus this Jamaican lady decides to take this opportunity to tell us a little something about the island is saying that they have she said here on the island we don't have problems we only have situations and I don't know why that struck me the way it did I mean I hadn't even started coming back to church yet but for some reason that little phrase stuck with me we don't have problems we only have situations so a little while back because this thing has just stuck with me I thought I'm going to look this up so I look up the definition of a problem I look up the definition of a situation I even Googled what's the difference between a problem and a situation what I could come up with is a problem is something that may or may not have an answer a problem might not have an answer to it there may not be a way of solving this problem there might be a way to solve the problem but the answer might not be what you're wanting it might not be a good outcome but that's the answer a problem could have more than one answer and it's hey take the lesser of the two evils it might not be this this might not be what you want to do and this might not but be what you want to do but these are the answers to the problem but a situation is something that can be changed and now you ask me what in the world does this have to do with me preaching to a dead bunny what does this have to do with the scriptures I was reading at the beginning and I'm going to tell you so there was a man by the name of Joshua that was in a battle and the sun started going down and this wasn't just a little scrimmage like I said this was a battle that they needed to end that today and as all the men start gathering around Joshua and they're saying the sun's going down Joshua these men are going to get away we're going to have to fight this battle tomorrow it might last another gay because they're going to regroup we got a big problem here but because Joshua knew the Creator he knew the one that created the son he knew the one that created the Earth he knew the one that created the moon he was able to look at those men and say no we don't have a problem we only have a situation that the Creator is able to change so I say to you son stand still I'm saying Moon don't move because I have a situation on my hand I cannot let the get dark I need to finish the battle today so God the creator of the heavens and earth that listened to the voice of a man changed the situation in a moment's time there was a story of a young man named David that was bringing food to his brothers and they were in a fight and as David walks up on this scene he he sees the children of Israel God's Army scared shaking in their sandals that's what he sees and he's wondering what is going on puts his stuff down and he hears this giant out here yelling threats to this Army and these men are scared to death and even Saul is telling him we've got a problem and David's like I'll go out there why he knew the Creator and as Saul tries to arm him with all this armor and all this stuff he get all this stuff off of me he takes a slingshot he walks over to a little creek to pick down pick up some Stones because the Creator that never misses a detail had put a boulder there years and years and years before knowing that the water from that Creek was going to keep pounding up against that Boulder and pounding up against that Boulder and hundreds of years later the water would break that Boulder down into five little smooth rocks that this young man David was going to need and as he picked those rocks up and he puts him in his pouch and he walks out onto the battlefield and Goliath is looking at this little guy like you've got to be kidding me right now this is what they sent out here I will put you on the end of my Spear and I will let the birds eat you you've got a problem little boy but because David knew the Creator he was able to look at Goliath and say no I don't have a problem I've only got a situation that he is more than able to change you're coming at me with a sword and a shield I come at you in the name of the host of the Lord and in a moment's time the situation changed because he was able to call on the Creator there's a story of a man named Lazarus that was dying his sister sent word to the Healer to Jesus Christ we need you to come this man your friend is dying and Jesus waits he waits a couple days and as he comes into the city Martha comes running to him if you would have only been here it's too late now but if you would have only been there you could have healed him the people standing around they know the Miracles that this man has performed this was his friend if he would have only been here I am the resurrection and life and he says believest Thou this believest thou this this is something that the ministers in the message those three words maybe they should get a hold of because there's a move in the message that's it's all about emotion if you jump up and down if you scream if you speak in tongues that's your evidence it's not the evidence he never ever said did you feel it he's never ever said did you feel it he said Do you believe it believest thou this the woman that touched the Hem of His Garment all those people touching him he's walking but all of a sudden he stopped he turned he didn't say because you felt it he said you are Faith because you believe it it's not about a feeling it's not about emotion I can feel the power of God right now I can feel I can feel him in this building right now but if I didn't feel one thing I would still know he was here because I believe this where two or three are gathered because I'm a Believer it's not about emotions and don't get me wrong I don't have a problem with emotions I'm getting emotional right now I don't have a problem with emotions but don't base everything on emotion don't base your experience on emotion it's not emotion do you believe so as Jesus stands there believest thou this moments after he says this he's found over weeping he's crying and the people are watching this he's got himself in a mess now he's never going to be able to forgive himself because he didn't come when they called him he didn't get here in time he's got a big problem now he's gonna have to live with this for the rest of his life but I love the way brother Bram talks about this as a man he was standing there his shoulders stooped over he was nothing to look at a little bitty man but when he stepped up to the tomb of and he squared up them shoulders all of a sudden he squared up CU he was ready to fight it didn't matter how long Lazarus had been dead it was not a problem it was only a situation that the Creator the one that created that man the one that gave that man life it was only a situation that he could change and give life back to that man it wasn't a problem it was just a situation so there I was little Lazarus laying on my Bible I just sincerely prayed for that little bunny a little Dead Bunny I picked him up out of that box he was still just as limp as he was the first day hadn't stiffened up his little eyes were closed all I could keep thinking about was he's just sleeping so I laid him there and I prayed and when I moved my hand back not one thing happened little Lazarus was still laying there just as dead as he was nothing happened I didn't understand that this and just being honest with you I got mad I got mad at this situation everything was piling up on me and I believe this I believe this with everything in me so why God why not let me have this little this little why not let me have this little moment why not let me have this little bunny the life of this little bunny that means nothing why not so I got angry and now it's time to go to church because it's Sunday morning so we get in the car my wife she can tell that I'm not good not saying anything Satan is in the back seat he's pulled himself right up got his hands on both my shoulders and he's just whispering in my ear is the word true because you just did everything it said to do and nothing happened or maybe you don't have the Holy Ghost maybe that's where the problem is or maybe it's both but he's talking to me and he's telling me it's a beautiful day out perfect day to go play golf and I'm driving to church and I mean everything he's saying it's right nothing he has said Is A Lie something took over in me something started driving that car and it wasn't me because something inside of me was going to go to church it was in that moment right there it was when I was at the end of my road but he stepped in I I couldn't go I Jonathan howchin couldn't go any further but he stepped in he said I'll carry you for a little bit he knew he had a servant that was in trouble he said 'i'll carry you for a little bit so we get to church I'm still mad I'm standing in the back back there not even inside the sanctuary back there back out in the entryway I'm standing back there the song service has started I'm talking to the deacons I looked at one of the deacons and said well I should probably go on in I sit down not singing any songs I'm really and truly sitting there thinking probably shouldn't even be in here sister gets up and sings a special one of my favorite songs nothing nothing I wouldn't give anything was upset was mad this did not work out the way I wanted it to brother Nathan comes out and he starts preaching his opening sermon opening scripture my wife looks over at me almost to say is like did you just hear what he said because it was Taylor Made For Me right then in that moment his title to his sermon was hope never heard a preach I've never heard a preacher preach on Hope before Faith yes not hope but as he starts to preach even his opening prayer it was as if he was praying for me right then in that moment as he starts to preach I've been in sermons and I'm sure you have too where the preacher says something and you're like wow man get out of my living room because that's what we were just talking about that might go on for five or 10 minutes this was every every single line every word he was saying everything that he was saying pertain to my situation right then you can call me a liar if you want that's you're entitled to that I've never seen that before every single line everything he said was exactly pertaining to my situation the whole sermon and he ends his sermon and he begins to close in prayer and in his closing prayer it's as if he was praying for me he hadn't got done praying and I was already on my way to the altar because I knew I had messed up he just took an hour of his time eight billion people on this planet he just took an hour of his time to talk directly to me for an hour straight without stopping I'm heading to the altar I'm at the altar for like 45 minutes I get up I turn around I see brother Nathan never seen this happen before he's sitting all the way in the back corner where this sister with the blonde hair is he's sitting back there he looks as discouraged as anybody I've ever seen in my life I walk back there he say I've never felt so much push back on a sermon in all my life the man suffered through a sermon and I mean he suffered for me wasn't nothing he could do about it because there was a creator that had a servant that wasn't doing too good and he needed to talk to that servant for a little while later on that evening we had a guest minister in brother Diego brother Diego comes in he starts preaching on a moment a moment in time that you will have but that you need to have the Holy Ghost to understand when that moment is so in that course of that day brother Nathan's sermon he gets up he starts preaching and where Satan was saying his word's not true brother Nathan's Sermon Just obliterated that brother Diego gets up behind him starts talking about when that moment comes you need the Holy Ghost to know when that moment is Satan telling me maybe you don't have the Holy Ghost let's get rid of that he used the very thing I was questioning to answer my question as those two brothers were preaching the one thing that kept coming to my mind was 1 Corinthians 1:21 for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe he used the thing I was questioning he said here you go I'm right here I'm right here with you you want something that nobody can explain away somebody explained that to me he gave me the very thing that I was looking for if I would have just waited on him but because it didn't happen the way I wanted it to happen I got angry but he had a servant he knows he knew and he knows that I'm a Believer it didn't matter what happened I'm a Believer in this yeah but he was stepped in and he carried me for a little bit my vocabulary is not big enough to tell you guys how important Having the Holy Ghost is in those moments when you get when you get in those moments right there where you're at the end of your rope the pastor is not going to carry you an evangelist it won't matter you need him he's the only one in those moments right there you better be anchored into something more than just a church you better be anchored into something more than just a message or more than a prophet you better be anchored into the Rock Jesus Christ because I'm telling you when those moments come when those Storms Come they will knock you down and if you're not anchored into something more than just your church you won't get back up that Holy Ghost is so important so many people in would have looked at that in that situation and they would have thought I had a real problem but for him it was only a situation it was only a situation that he could change in a moment out by the name of Daniel in the Bible he gotten himself into a the the the the some men had come to the king you guys know the story they had tricked the king into declaring a a proclamation That Couldn't pray and Daniel gets caught praying and they throw him in the Lion's Den and they were good friends the king and Daniel were good friends even the king thought I've got a problem here I got a real problem here but the next morning when he yelled down to Daniel are you still there yes this was only a situation that my God was able to shut the mouths of the Lions was just a situation that was able that he was able to change yes Lord story of the the three the three children of Israel that are about to be thrown into a fire how often does this happen with us he's always in that fire everybody was looking at that situation thinking what a problem but it wasn't a problem it was only a situation it was just a situation that could be changed there was a man by the name of Jesus Christ he came and he lived a life of misery he could have had a wife he could have had a house he could have had nice clothes but he said I sanctify them myself for their sake he lived a life of misery and then he died on a cross for us and as Satan looking at that situation thinking I've got him now now he's got a problem but we're talking about the Creator we're
