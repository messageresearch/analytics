We ask that you be in every portion now of the service in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. If you'll just go with me in the Psalms this morning. We're going to go over to Psalms 40. Psalms 40. I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me and heard my cry. He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God. Many shall see it in fear, and shall trust in all the in the Lord. Many, oh Lord, my God, are in thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us, ward, they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee. If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered. Then said I, low, I come in the volume of the book. It is written of me. &gt;&gt; I have preached righteousness in the great congregation. Lo, I have not refrained my lips. Oh Lord, thou knowest. withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, oh Lord, thy loving kindness and thy truth continually preserve me. Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me, O Lord. Make haste to help me. Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that they say unto me, "Aha! Aha!" &gt;&gt; Let's together. But I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinkketh upon me. Thou art my help and my deliverer. Make no tearing. Oh my God. God bless you, brother David. &gt;&gt; This morning, it's good to see each and everyone out this morning.

But when you talk about his grandkids, he really smiles then. Amen. We're just just want to thank the Lord for watching over for Zoe and Josh and little Haven last night. And at first they saw thought Sister Zoe had a a broken arm, but she didn't have. And so they're resting this morning. We just want to say thank you, Lord, and give the Lord a hand of praise this morning. Amen. He is He's an awesome God this morning, you know, and we we live in a in a crazy world. Amen.

Give him a hand of praise this morning. Amen. Amen. I would not be denied this morning. Amen. Let's sing that with all of our hearts this morning. Well, when pains of death seized on my soul unto the Lord, I cry. till Jesus came and he made me whole. Well, I would not be denied. Well, I would not be denied. Oh, I would not be denied. until Jesus came and he made me whole. Well, I would not be denied. Well, as Jacob in the days of Lord, will I wrestle with the Lord at time with a courage? Well, I stood up on his word. Well, I would not be day night. Oh no. Well, I would not be denied. Well, till Jesus came and he made me whole. Well, I would not be denied. Well, oh, Satan said my Lord was gone and he would not Yes. But praise the Lord. The word is God. Christ the Lord is here. Well, I would not be denied. Oh, I would not be denied. until Jesus came and he made me whole. But I would not be. Sing that last verse again if we could. Well, oh, Satan said, "My Lord was gone and he would not hear my prayer." But praise the Lord, the work is done and Christ the Lord is here. Well, I would not be denied. Oh, no I would not be denied until Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be denied. Amen. Is that your desire this morning? How many's ever had the devil tell you that it don't matter? God don't hear your prayer when you're praying. And I always tell him, I said, 'Well, if it don't matter, why are you bothering me while I'm praying? If my prayers ain't no good and he don't hear them, why are you bothering me this morning? But I believe we have a prayer answering God this morning. Don't you, brother Daniel and brother Michael John, Brother Paul, would you come this morning? And we have some prayer requests this morning. And we want to take them to the Lord in prayer. Like I said, we thank the Lord for watching over Zoe and and Josh and little Haven. and just want to pray that God will continue to heal their body this morning. And also remember sister Parish and Sister Peggy, our shutins. And also we want to continue to remember McCagan and and Paulie and Palmer this morning that God will continue to be with them. And and also Aiden and Katie Wade are sick this morning. We want to remember them in prayer that God will just touch their body this morning. And also uh Brother Joe said remember Sister Hannah. She's here this morning. Her back's bothering her this morning. and just pray that God will just touch her body this morning. If you have a need in your heart, you might let it be known this morning. And Amen. Brother Tommy, would you stand and pray over Well, he's gone. I I just thought I seen him over there. I'm sorry. Brother Wade, Jonathan Wade, would you stand and pray this morning? Amen. Let's sing that song. I keep falling in love with him over and well. When I first fell in love with Jesus and I gave him all of my heart and I thought I couldn't love him more than I did right from the start. But when I look back over the mountains and the valleys where I've been and it makes me know I love him so much more than I Oh, I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. Oh, I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. Oh, he gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by. Oh, what a love. And I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. Well, there's a hand that I hold on to through each valley and each trial. And there's a shoulder that I lean upon as I face another mile. Well, there's a love that I can depend on. It's fresh and new each day. And with love, my heart is overflowing. And that is why I say, "Oh, I keep falling in love with him over and over again." Over and over again. Oh, I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. He gets sweeter and sweeter as the day goes by. Oh, what a love between my Lord and I. keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over. &gt;&gt; Well, good morning. Isn't that the truth? &gt;&gt; The more you know him, the more you fall in love. This house where I'm living, it's not much to look at, but I'm blessed and I call it mine. But soon I'll be leaving to go live with Jesus. You can have it if you're left behind. Cuz I hold a clear title to a home that's far better, that would never flood or decay. If the rapture was yesterday, would you still be here today? If the rapture was yesterday, would you still be here today? If the trumpet had sounded by saints surrounded, would you have been called away while there's still time to make up your mind? Let me invite you to pray. If the rapture was yesterday, would you still be here today? Jesus. Jesus said when he comes back, two will be sleeping, one taken and one left behind. How people can go on who aren't rapture ready. Don't it just stagger your mind for a one new lead either way. If the rapture was yesterday, would you still be here today? If the rapture was yesterday, would you still be here today? If the trumpet had sounded by saints surrounded, would you have been called away? While there's still time to make up your mind, let me invite you to pray. If the rapture was yesterday, would you still be here today? If the rapture was yesterday, we wouldn't be here today. If the trumpet had sounded by saints surrounded, we would have been called away. While there's still time for you to make up your mind, let us invite you to pray. If the rapture was yesterday, we wouldn't be here today. If the rapture was yesterday, we wouldn't be here today. Well, God bless you all and I hope the Lord appreciates that young man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Appreciate Brother Glenn, don't you? And his love for the Lord. and he asked me the other day to to help him.

So, God bless you. Let's give Brother Glenn another hand this morning. Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother Daniel and Sister Annabelle have a song this morning. the light of the world.

This is my song. Let the worshippers arise. Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing. I'm surrendering my all. I surrender to the king. Father, I hear it growing louder.

I surrender to the King. Hallelujah. Give him a hand clap of praise this morning. Hallelujah. Surrendering my all to the King. The King of Kings, the Lord of Lords. That's what we're here to do, right? To praise him, to lift him up, to worship him, to give him the glory that he deserves in this hour. Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. And we uh certainly uh thankful for your prayers. We've we felt them. And I tell you, last night things just begin to pour and reveal. Thank you, musicians. We appreciate you. &gt;&gt; Aren't we thankful for our musicians? I tell you what, we sure appreciate him, brother Daniel. Way to step up, buddy. Way to step up. So, we uh we certainly appreciate him. But I do do appreciate your prayers. Felt your pres the prayers and the presence of the Lord as things begin to just unfold to me. So, we uh want to thank you for that. And I was just back there. I was peeking in on Brother Ber preaching there at Brother Ron's this morning for just a minute. And he's right in the middle of the heart of things. So, we'll remember him in prayer this morning, too. Turn with me, if you would, into the into your Bibles to the book of Galatians. How many come to have church? &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, we're living in a in an hour where there's no better place to be and no no better thing to do than to come and have church and to hear the word and let the word live through us and and lead us and guide us. So we uh we certainly want to uh give our part to the Lord. So, Brother Brandham is speaking. I want to speak this morning just to go ahead and give our title, but I want to speak this morning on Abraham's seed fully equipped. Abraham's seed fully equipped. The prophet tells us, he says, "The devil can beat you around and he can beat you around the stump on your feelings." He said, ' If I had to go by my feelings, there wouldn't be many times that I would uh that I there wouldn't be many times that I would be all out of condition. But I don't rest on my feelings. He said, I rest upon the unconditional word of the living God who made the covenant with me that if I would believe it, not if I would feel it, but what I believe in. He said, Jesus never said, "Did you feel it?" He said, "Do you believe it?" He said, "Now, I want you to notice this one time, Israel, they was called out to war against the Philistines." He said, "And the Philistines had gathered over on the side of the mountain and a and there was a valley between them and Israel on the other side." And just as the enemy always does, he feel he felt like he's got the upper hand. He said, "And when he feels like he's got the upper hand, he likes to puff and he likes to blow and he likes to brag about it." How many's ever had Satan do that to you? He you he thinks he's got the upper hand and he thinks, listen what he says. He thinks if he can just GET YOU TO COW DOWN. He said if he thinks that he can get your little heart to flutter a few times to make you think you didn't get your healing. &gt;&gt; He says, "Yeah." He says, he likes to do things like that. If he can get you to look at your hand and say, "My hand's no better." He loves to do that because he's got you conquered right then. He's got you conquered right then. If he could just get you to think that. We don't rely on thinking. We don't rely on feelings, but we rely on the unadulterated tr PROVEN TRUE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says. I see a crutch sitting back there here by a lady. He said if if he can make her believe that she's going to have to use that crutch to get out of here, she's whipped. But when she won't look at that, but when she will look towards the promise of God, that crutch will be left in ITS SEAT. SHE WON'T NEED A CRUTCH TO LEAVE OUT OF THE BUILDING, BUT WHEN SHE STANDS ON THE WORD, THE CRUTCH WILL STAY AND SHE WILL LEAVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Galatians chapter 3, it's already getting warm up here. Chapter 3:22. But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ may be given unto them that what? &gt;&gt; Believe. But before faith came, might we say, before Jesus came, listen to this. Before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto faith which should afterwards be revealed. Therefore, wherefore the law was our school master to bring us unto Christ. Do this, do that, go here, do that, act this way, speak this way, the treat the temple this way. The law was our school master to bring us to Christ that we might be justified by faith. But after faith come, after Jesus arrived on the scene, after after the Holy Ghost, after the ca after the crucifixion, after the Holy Ghost, after faith had come on the scene, we are no longer under a school master. FOR WE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you has been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. So you if you've BEEN BAPTIZED IN CHRIST, YOU HAVE PUT ON FAITH. YOU'VE PUT ON CHRIST. YOU'VE UNDER YOU PUT ON OVERCOMING POWER AND YOU NO longer live under the thumb of the law. But now we live, brothers and sisters, under the blood THAT WAS SHED ON CALVARY. SO IT'S NO LONGER a set of rules to follow. Think about this. Come on, church. It's no longer a set of rules TO FOLLOW, BUT NOW it's a love affair. It's a love affair that grows deeper and deeper and deeper every day as the day goes by. Because what? THE HUSBAND AND THE BRIDE ARE BECOMING ONE. THEY'RE BECOMING ONE THOUGHT. THEY'RE BECOMING ONE IN ACTION. THEY'RE BECOMING ONE IN MIND. AND JUST LIKE IT WAS ON the day of Pentecost, they're becoming in one accord. &gt;&gt; There was neither Jew nor Greek. There was neither blood by bond or free. There was neither male or female. For ye are all one. On the day of Pentecost, they were what? &gt;&gt; One. But you are all now one in Christ. And if and if be you be in Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning with grateful hearts, Lord. Thankful that you've laid this message on our hearts. And Lord, we put notes on paper as so to speak and we've got thoughts processing in our mind. But Lord, it's not about my my thinking or my thoughts, but it's about you moving on the scene. It's about your presence in the building. And Lord, we feel you this morning. We just ask Lord that you would just move in our midst and in the congregation that you just sweep through the aisles this morning. Encourage those that are un unencouraged this morning. release people from the bonds of depression and fear and doubts and worries, all the the anxieties that are pressed upon us in this hour we living in. It's a tough hour, Lord. But if we stay true to the word and and and don't fail to rely upon your promises, the word says we'll be free. So Lord, speak to our hearts this morning. Allow us to grasp the reality of the word in our lives. We love you, Lord. We lift you on high and thank you for all you do in Jesus name. Amen. You can have your seats this morning. Turn with me if you would into the book of John. We'll read a little bit out of chapter 8. John chapter 8 verse 31. Very familiar scriptures here. Jesus then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then you be my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and they answered answered him and said we be Abraham's seed. Now I want you to watch how these how these theologians were thinking. We be Abraham's seed and we've never been in bondage to any man. How sayest thou that ye shall be made free? And Jesus answered them and said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, whosoever committh sin is the servant of sin." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you're COMMITTING SIN, YOU ARE SERVANT TO THAT SIN. YOU ARE LETTING IT BE your master and your taskmaster. &gt;&gt; But now WATCH WHAT HE SAYS. AND THE SERVANT ABIDETH NOT IN THE HOUSE FOREVER. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STAY IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD IF you're serving sin. &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS NOT GOING TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF YOUR HOME IF YOUR HOME IS FULL of sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But but it says the son abideth ever. The son abideth ever. If the son therefore shall make YOU FREE, YE SHALL BE free indeed. Hallelujah. This morning, if you've been set free THIS MORNING BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, YOU ARE FREE INDEED. SO, brothers and sisters, we're talking about a true spiritual freedom. And with this true SPIRITUAL FREEDOM COMES POWER, COMES AUTHORITY FROM JESUS CHRIST BECAUSE IT'S JESUS CHRIST THAT SETS YOU free today. IT'S JESUS CHRIST THAT has liberated his people from the bondage OF SIN. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A PHYSICAL BONDAGE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SHACKLES and chains and and being locked up in a prison. NO, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A MAN HOLDING US BACK. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE IN CHRIST, MAN CAN'T STOP YOU. MAN CAN'T HOLD YOU BACK. &gt;&gt; MAN MAY CRITICIZE. MAN MAY MOCK. MAN MAY put you down. But man will never stop the work of God. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's in a church, in a home, in a business. If you put God first, But Jesus is allowing you and I to in this day to live freely in the world that we're LIVING IN BY THE word of this day. &gt;&gt; Well, I like that. Praise the Lord. Somebody's in tune. We're free this hour. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE'RE FREE IN THIS DAY. WE'RE FREE IN THIS HOUR TO HAVE FAITH TO RECEIVE THE PROMISES THAT GOD AND THE blessings that God has laying in the word for every believer. It's for you and it's for I and it's ours freely to have. WHY? COME ON. WE'RE NO LONGER ARE we slaves to sin, but we're CHILDREN OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WEDNESDAY NIGHT, I SAID, "HOW MANY'S GOT THE HOLY GHOST?" HANDS ALL OVER THE BUILDING. WE'RE CHILDREN OF GOD. WE IDENTIFY WITH THAT. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO identify with that, why not reap the benefits of it? &gt;&gt; Don't expect the benefits and the rewards if you're not living the life. &gt;&gt; I better throw that in there. I don't want everybody thinking you can do what you want and the Lord's just going to bl That ain't the way it works. &gt;&gt; But we no longer HAVE TO BE SLAVES TO THE FEARS OF THIS LIFE. WE no longer HAVE TO BE SLAVES TO THE DOUBTS AND THE WORRIES AND THE UNBELIEF, the rage THAT THAT IS ALL AROUND us in this world. I don't have to be a slave to that. &gt;&gt; We don't have to let habits, filthy habits control our lives. &gt;&gt; We're no LONGER UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE EVIL THAT PRODUCES. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT PRODUCES. It produces spiritual death. &gt;&gt; And you SEE WHEN THAT SPIRITUAL DEATH COMES UPON PEOPLE WHO IS UNDER THAT VERY BONDAGE OF THE SPIRITUAL EVIL this world, YOU SEE THE MOANING, YOU see the groaning, &gt;&gt; you see THE BELLY ACHING. NOBODY'S EVER HAPPY. NOTHING'S EVER GOOD ENOUGH. NOBODY PREACHES GOOD ENOUGH. NOBODY SINGS GOOD ENOUGH. There's always a murmur and a complaining in the camp when they're living a life of spiritual death. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the SPIRIT ON THE INSIDE IS SLOWLY DYING AWAY. &gt;&gt; But I'm not under the control of that spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our opening quote, brother Brandham, listen what he said. When Satan feels, we don't run on feelings. Satan runs on feelings. We run on an absolute. &gt;&gt; He runs on a mind game. &gt;&gt; HE SAID WHEN SATAN FEELS LIKE HE'S GOT THE UPPER HAND, HE HUFFS and puffs and blows and drags about. He said when he thinks, &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, HE THOUGHT HE WAS BETTER THAN GOD. HE THOUGHT that he wanted to HAVE A KINGDOM. HE THOUGHT HE could rule the world. HE THOUGHT THAT he could rule your lives. &gt;&gt; I GOT SOME WORD FOR HIM. HE THAT HAS BEEN SET FREE IS FREE INDEED. HE NO LONGER RULES MY LIFE. The enemy THINKS THAT HE CAN MAKE YOUR heart flutter. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, I just I've been feeling this and I've been feeling that. I think I might ought to go to the doctor. Well, maybe. But maybe God says, "By my stripes, &gt;&gt; you're healed." &gt;&gt; STANDING UPON THE PROMISES OF GOD. LISTEN WHAT HE SAYS. HE SAYS, "IF HE can make you look at your hand and say, "It's no better and makes you say it's no better." He loves to DO THAT BECAUSE HE'S GOT YOU CONQUERED RIGHT THEN. BUT BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THE WORD IN OUR DAY, THE WORD THAT WE'VE BEEN TAUGHT in the work that's BEEN PREACHED TO US OVER AND OVER AND OVER IS A WORD THAT SAYS WE ARE more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT TO BE CONQUERED, BUT WE'RE MORE THAN CONQUERORS. WE'RE NOT THE DEFEATED, BUT WE'RE THE VICTORIOUS in Christ. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S WHO WE'RE PREACHING TO TODAY. It's not through the law. Think about our scriptures. It's not through the law. It's not through the rules of man-made ideas. It's not under the dictatorship of theology. It's not even under the the the the ideas or the thinking of a pastor or a preacher. Don't y'all get so quiet. He'll listen. Brother Ber will listen. I'm not saying anything he won't agree with &gt;&gt; because he knows and I know. And every preacher that preaches the word of God knows if we can get up here and start injecting, oh, this is my idea. This is my opinion. That's just what you got is man's idea and MAN'S OPINION. &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A WORD IN THIS HOUR, &gt;&gt; an absolute. Who cares what I think? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, MY THINKING HAS GOTTEN ME IN A WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE over time. &gt;&gt; Some of you is honest with me. &gt;&gt; But you know, when I stand up on the word of God, &gt;&gt; things are a LOT DIFFERENT. SO, IT'S not under the rules of man and ideas, BUT IT'S BECAUSE HE FIRST loved me. &gt;&gt; That is where we STAND THIS MORNING. BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED ME AND HE CHOSE ME BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. HE CHOSE YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world and said you don't have to live in defeat. &gt;&gt; BROTHERS AND SISTERS, NOW A HEART, think about this, YOU AND I, OUR HEARTS THAT WAS ONCE HARD, our hearts THAT WERE ONCE FULL of a sinful nature, A HEART THAT WAS ONCE LIVING IN MISERY. LET ME TELL YOU, I WAS A MISERABLE PERSON BEFORE I GOT IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; OH, I smiled. I I done this and I run and I done all I wanted to do with my friends. And even when I WAS MARRIED, BEFORE WE REALLY GOT IN CHRIST, MISERABLE. &gt;&gt; MISERABLE. You say, "Well, why was you miserable?" You was going to church. I was going to church. I was in church, but church wasn't in me. &gt;&gt; There's a difference. &gt;&gt; You can COME THROUGH THOSE DOORS TIME AFTER TIME after time, BUT IF WHAT YOU HEAR DON'T LEAVE WITH you &gt;&gt; and YOU START LIVING THE WORD THAT YOU'VE HEARD PREACHED, &gt;&gt; defeated Amen. &gt;&gt; I was helpless and defeated. &gt;&gt; You know, life is so much better in Christ. &gt;&gt; Life is Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; GIVE HIM PRAISE THIS MORNING. LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER IN CHRIST. I've been through some times of defeat. Somebody look at me AND SAY, "WELL, HOW DID YOU GO THROUGH THAT? YOU YOU ALWAYS GET UP AND YOU JUST SMILE AND YOU GO ON. WHY? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO TO CHANGE IT?" I don't lay down in defeat. I say, "Lord, what are we going to do today? &gt;&gt; What direction are we GOING TO GO TODAY?" BECAUSE YESTERDAY DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO GOOD FOR ME. I must have had some of my own stinking thinking in it. So, Lord, what are we going to do today? the you know what I found out and we preach it but the more I pray the better I feel. &gt;&gt; THE MORE I GO BEFORE GOD IN PRAYER AND COMMIT and dedicate my life, my home, my children, &gt;&gt; my loved ones, THE MORE I GO IN PRAYER AND SAY, "GOD, YOU KNOW THEIR SITUATION. YOU KNOW THEIR SITUATION. YOU KNOW THIS ONE'S SITUATION. I COULD SAY A LOT OF THINGS BUT LORD you you can change the situation. &gt;&gt; So in prayer is where I find victory. In prayer is where I find victory. And I want to let you know I told about told you about our hearts that were hardened, our hearts that were miserable and our hearts that were that WERE DEPRESSED AND DEFEATED. BUT THAT SAME HEART THAT SAME HEART THAT HAS COME IN CONTACT WITH CHRIST AND IS NOW IN CHRIST, THAT SAME HEART HAS NOW BEEN TENDERIZED, THAT SAME HEART HAS BEEN SOFTENED UP. And the things that I USED TO DO, I don't do anymore. &gt;&gt; THE SINFUL NATURES THAT I ONCE HAD, I DON'T have it anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Man, somebody must have preached a real message to get you to change." No, &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T THAT AT ALL, MY FRIENDS. IT WASN'T BECAUSE SOME SOME PREACHER COME UP HERE AND PREACHED HELL, FIRE, AND DAMNATION TO me and scared me to an altar. You know, that was a trend. WOMEN DON'T CUT YOUR HAIR. WOMEN DON'T DO THIS. MEN DON'T DO THAT. BOYS DON'T DO THIS. GIRLS DON'T DO THAT. AND IF YOU DON'T COME UP HERE TO THIS ALTAR AND REPENT IN 10 SECONDS, YOU'RE GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL. 10. &gt;&gt; NINE. YOU LET SOMEBODY GET UP HERE AND PREACH WITH SOME POWER AND AUTHORITY AND SEE IF THE THAT THE PEWS DON'T clear out and everybody be up HERE WEEPING AND SOBBING. GOD HELP ME. &gt;&gt; But does it stick? &gt;&gt; But does it is rules and regulations, BROTHERS AND SISTERS? BUT WE ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. IT'S NOT ABOUT DOS AND DON'TS. &gt;&gt; God don't have to threaten you. &gt;&gt; You're the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. If I went to threatening that pretty lady right there, I'd be picking my eyeballs up off the ground. I guarantee you, you can laugh you want, man. You be doing the same thing &gt;&gt; because women are not doormats. AND THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST IS NOT A DOORMAT TO BE TOLD, "DO THIS, DO THAT, DO THIS, GO HERE, GO THERE." I don't have to tell HER WHAT TO DO. SHE LOVES ME AND SHE DOES WHAT SHE KNOWS IS PLEASING to this guy. &gt;&gt; Come on. I don't do the things I used to do because I love him too much for what he's done for me. &gt;&gt; I love him entirely too much to hurt him. &gt;&gt; I love him too much to bruise him. &gt;&gt; You know what? You know what, BROTHERS AND SISTERS? I'M THE one that put him on Calvary in the first place. &gt;&gt; If you're honest, you going to put your name there. &gt;&gt; I've put HIM UP THERE ONE TIME. I'VE DONE PUT HIM THROUGH TORTURE ONE TIME. &gt;&gt; I'VE PUT HIM through beatating one time and bruised. And he went AND HE SAID, "OKAY, for you &gt;&gt; for you. I'm going to go to Calvary and freely give myself for you. One thing in this life I don't want to be guilty of is putting him there again. I don't want to hurt him. I don't want to do nothing that would be displeasing to him. You say, "Well, are you saying you're flawless? You don't make mistakes?" &gt;&gt; I asked my wife if she's flawless or makes any mistakes. She'll be honest. She'll tell you every day. I'm talking about just little maybe a little little spad here. I know y'all probably don't have those your home. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when those things happen, I didn't say get out. I said, "Let's talk about this." Lord, I don't know why I'm going down this hole. Let's talk about this. And you know, when we go through times in our life and maybe we disagree or we rebel, might we say, or or have a little spat against God, against Jesus himself, he don't kick us to the curb, &gt;&gt; but he says, "Let's talk about this. Why don't you visit me in prayer for a little while? WHY DON'T YOU LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS AND LET'S see if we can't work this situation out." And if your heart is something's going on IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU'VE GOTTEN HARD ON GOD, YOU'VE GOTTEN HARD ON CHURCH, YOU'VE GOTTEN HARD on your fellow believers, talk it over with God AND SEE IF THAT HEART don't begin to get a little bit softer and a little more tender and a little more welcoming. And then you BEGIN TO DRAW YOUR CIRCLE BIGGER AND SAY, "HEY, LET'S ALL BE LET'S BE A family again." &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're the family of God. &gt;&gt; You see, it's a love affair. Now, You know, for 20 years of being around this message and and just being a Christian, I heard people say, "You can't do this. You can't do that. You're going to hell if you do this. You're going to hell if you do that." I thought, man, you think about what I'm fixing to say. I thought, man, can't nobody live this. Can you, brother Troy? No. Brother John can't do it. You can try to follow all the but somewhere you going to lose your temper. You're going to do something maybe just a little sneaky. Then you something's going to come to you. Oh, I shouldn't have done that. But one thing about it, the love that you have on the inside, it'll bring you right down to the foot of Calvary &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, I should not have done this. You have taught me better. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE SHOWN ME A BETTER WAY TO LIVE. IT'S NOT A OH MY GOODNESS. THINK ABOUT WHAT HE DID. HE SHOWED THE DISCIPLES, "LOOK, I WANT YOU TO WATCH THE LIFE THAT I LIVE, AND YOU MIMIC THE LIFE THAT I LIVE. You do the THINGS THE WAY I DO THEM. YOU TALK THE WAY I TALK, AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE." &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was training them up for a work. HE WAS TRAINING THEM UP FOR A TIME WHEN THE HOLY GHOST WOULD COME ON THEM. YES, they had the rules. They saw the rules. They saw the letter. But when the Holy Ghost came, they didn't follow the letter. They lived the life. We got TO LIVE THE LIFE, brothers and sisters. Live the life. THE BEST SERMON I'LL EVER PREACH IS THE LIFE I LIVE. The best life, the the BEST EXAMPLE YOU'LL EVER GIVE ANYBODY IS THE way you treat them and the life you live before them. You see, that's why as believers, WE'VE HAD THIS ETERNAL union that has taken place between me and my savior. &gt;&gt; It's not between me and my wife. It's not between me and my children. It's not between me and anybody else. &gt;&gt; But it's between me and my savior. And as believers, that's why our lives have to be rooted in the word of God. And that's why we stand on the promises OF GOD. WE'RE TRUSTING IN THE LOVE THAT WAS PLACED ON DISPLAY AT CALVARY FOR THE ENTIRE world to see. This wasn't some hidden show. THIS WAS A PUBLIC DISPLAY FOR the entire world to see and to know and to experience. You see, he loved us so much up on that public display for the world to see. He loved us so much that he said, "I must go, but I will not leave you comfortless." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will not LEAVE YOU COMFORTLESS. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL promises from Jesus Christ in John chapter 14 IN THE BIBLE BECAUSE IT TELLS US EVEN THOUGH HE'S DEPARTED THE WORLD, EVEN THOUGH WE can't walk up and shake his hands today, even though we can't go TALK TO HIM FACE TO FACE and and lip to ear, so to speak, BUT HE SAID, "I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU. I'm committed to send you back the Holy Spirit so that you won't be comfortless. Hallelujah. Not only that, but I'm not just I'm not going to leave you. I'm going to send it back and I'M GOING TO PUT IT INSIDE of you &gt;&gt; so that YOU CAN FEEL SO THAT YOU CAN EXPERIENCE. SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE WARMTH AND THE AND THE LOVE THAT I ONCE HAD. NOW YOU CAN HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You Why is the capstone love? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. When Jesus was on the scene, it was about love. &gt;&gt; He loves you so much &gt;&gt; that he GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN son that whosoever &gt;&gt; should believe. In other words, he looks down and upon the cross and we hear the words he says before he gets ready to leave. But what he's really trying to say is, "My love, you're not alone." Think about it. My love, you're not alone. You're not helpless. You don't have to be lonely. You don't have to BE DEPRESSED. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BOUND BY SIN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BOUND by unbelief because I'm going to equip you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to EQUIP YOU WITH AN ENDURING PRESENCE THAT WILL LEAD YOU. And I'm going to EQUIP YOU WITH A PRESENCE THAT WILL GUIDE YOU AND WILL GO BEFORE YOU IN YOUR BATTLES that you face. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T FIGHT THIS FIGHT ALONE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Thank God for the Holy Spirit today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why would anybody want to debate the works of the Holy Spirit? Why would ANYBODY WANT TO SAY THE HOLY SPIRIT'S NOT FOR us today? &gt;&gt; Why? Why would you want to live a dead lifeless Christian life when the word Christian itself, as we've explained many times, is Christlike? &gt;&gt; How can I act like Christ if he ain't leading me? &gt;&gt; How can I act like Christ? How can I treat PEOPLE THE WAY CHRIST WOULD TREAT THEM IF I'M NOT BEING LED by something that says, "Do just like this." &gt;&gt; Let me TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS. WHAT IT IS. and you watch and you tell me if I'm not right after service. But let me tell you what it is. People who live thinking that the Holy Spirit is not for them today. Hard, &gt;&gt; miserable, defeated. &gt;&gt; Miracles are impossible. &gt;&gt; We going to get to it. Ephesians chapter 3, it says, "Now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power," can you pull that up, brother, real quick? Ephesians chapter 3. Now, if you Bible readers and you've been you've taken notes and you mark your Bibles and you know you know I just read that incorrectly. I didn't finish the verse. We got time. Don't don't rush, brother Deon. Chapter 3. There we go. I think it's 20. Ephesians 3:20. YEAH. NOW UNTO HIM THAT IS ABLE TO DO EXCEEDINGLY ABUNDANTLY above all that we ask or think according to the power. That's where I stopped. But we GOT TO UNDERLINE. WE GOT TO HIGHLIGHT. WE GOT TO CIRCLE THE NEXT PART. THAT WORKKETH in us. &gt;&gt; THAT WORKKETH IN THE BELIEVER THAT WORKKETH IN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE POWER THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THIS IS GOD'S ABILITY TO ACT BEYOND HUMAN IMAGINATION. Beyond human imagination. It's his ability to ACT UPON OUR PRAYERS AND EXCEED HUMAN EXPECTATIONS. YOU SEE, AS HUMAN BEINGS, WE HAVE EXPECTATIONS. And a lot of times because of things we've been through, the life we've been dealt, the the the the hand that we've had to live, sometimes our expectations don't get too high off the ground. But that's not what the word says. We're standing on the words. WE'RE NOT STANDING UP on our experiences that keep us down here. We're standing up on the word says that said it's exceedingly and abundantly above all that we ask or think. Let me tell you, God is a good God. &gt;&gt; We can't fathom as believers, as Christians, WE CAN'T FATHOM THE GOODNESS OF GOD AND ALL that he does for us on a minute-by-minute basis. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT YOUR HEART BEATING, do you? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's an involuntary response. Love dub loved dub loved dub loved dub loved dub. You let it stop for a second or two. You begin to think real quick. Oh Lord. YEAH. YOU LET SOME OF THOSE THINGS HAPPEN. YOU BEGIN TO THINK real quick. But we we we we we just don't hold to the highest esteem of all that he does in our life. Brothers and sisters, you know, I was listening. And I was thinking, I hope many of you probably listened to brother Ber's service last night and he gave the testimony of Sister Donna. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; BUT HE BE TO TESTIFY AND HE BE TO tell all of the lies that Satan had placed in her life. &gt;&gt; It looks like Yeah, it looks like you got cancer in all your lymph nodes. It looks like you've got cancer in your bones. It looks like you've got cancer in your lungs. It looks like you got cancer in your breast. &gt;&gt; But what she say, &gt;&gt; that's what he said. But God says, &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS THE PET SCANS ARE CLEAR. exceedingly and abundantly above all that we can think. In our human being thinking, we think that's not possible as a human. But as the spirit dwells on the inside, oh hallelujah. As the spirit dwells and moves on the inside, WE FIND OUT THAT IT'S MORE THAN WHAT I THINK. IT'S WHAT GOD DOES. GOD IS A HEALER. GOD IS A DELIVERER. You see, we're going to change gears here for just a minute. We talked about adoption last Wednesday, this past Wednesday, and we thinking about adoption. You see, when a family goes to an to adopt a child, they go into an agreement with an agency. They go into an agreement and they and they go in there and they ensure that agent that they're going to love that child. I'm going to love that child. I'm gonna provide for that child. I'm gonna do everything I can for that child. I'm going to be here for that child through thick and through thin. All right. They go to adopt that child not out of pity. Christ didn't go to Calvary out of pity for you. They don't go to adopt that child out of pity or out of obligation. But there is A SINCERE DESIRE DOWN in their heart to love that child. They say, "I'M GOING TO ADOPT THIS CHILD. I'M GOING TO LOVE THIS CHILD. I'M going to embrace this child just like it's my own." &gt;&gt; That is the process of adoption. And when that child, listen now, when that child is adopted into the family and it becomes one of them, that child begins to gain access. That child gains access to brothers and sisters and grandparents and aunts and uncles and cousins. Are you with me? And they THEY TAKE THAT CHILD AND THEY SAY, "LOOK, here's your very own bedroom. You have a bed of your own now. This is yours." Well, is there strings attached? No. No. We We want to do this for you. our hearts. WELL, IN OUR HEARTS, WE LOVE YOU. In our hearts, we want you to be part of us. This is all yours. They give them A BED. THEY GIVE THEM a seat at the family table. This is your chair, Tommy. God said, "This is your chair. This is your chair." AND AND AND THEY PULL UP AND THEY GIVE THEM EVERY BIT OF THAT. This is your own table, A SEAT AT THE TABLE. And they even accept you of their own by giving you their own family name. They changed that, right? There's been a change. Correct. You go through a legal process and say, "I'VE I'VE ADOPTED THIS CHILD. WE'RE taking them into our home. THEY'RE ONE OF US. NOW, I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM MY LAST NAME." You ever heard of Mrs. Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. But what I want you to know this morning in this adoption process, one of the most important things that they can do is equip that child with a name that carries authority. Their name once was no good. THEIR NAME ONCE WAS A NAME KNOWN IN AN ORPHANAGE. Their name once was a name that was lost and undone and helpless. BUT WHEN THAT CHILD WAS ADOPTED INTO THE FAMILY, THEY gave them a name, a new name. AND THAT NAME NOW SAYS YOU HAVE POWER AND YOU HAVE THE SAME AUTHORITY THAT THE FATHER'S name carries. So if you NEED TO GO BUY GROCERIES, GO BUY GROCERIES. IF YOU NEED GAS IN YOUR CAR, CARSON, GO GET GAS IN YOUR CAR. It's the same authority when you swipe that card. &gt;&gt; Here's your debit card, son. Swipe it at will. Just kidding. &gt;&gt; But you know what I'm saying? He's adopted. He's pulled them in. And what is he doing BY GIVING HIM THAT NAME? HE'S GIVING HIM EVERYTHING that he has need of. and he's equipped him with the very same life than the ability to live the way he lives. &gt;&gt; So if you say, "I can't live a Christian life," you ain't been fully adopted. &gt;&gt; I can't do this. I can't do that. You need to go to the adoption agency. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO GET TO THE CROSS. YOU NEED TO BE AT THE FOOT OF CALVARY AND SAY, "GOD, POUR OUT YOUR LOVE UPON ME. GIVE ME THE BLESSINGS, LORD. &gt;&gt; MAKE ME ALL OF YOURS. I WANT A SEAT AT THE TABLE. You see, anybody who's ever done or knows anything about mechanic or handiwork and carpentry, you know that having the right kind of equipment is half the battle. Ask Tommy, I'm gonna leave you alone today, buddy. I'm gonna pick on brother Joe Adams. He won't mind. He won't mind if I tell you this. He comes up here last week or when it was he preached and visits and he's like, "I want to do some renovations on the house, but I need an air compressor. I don't have an air compressor. I need I need an air gun. I don't I I NEED A CHOPSAW so that I can chop this wood up. I want to do some trim work." So he searches out marketplace and Lord blesses him. I'll just tell you. He gets a he gets a air compressor and he he he gets chopsaw and he finds all this stuff here and he takes it home and after he's been home for a few days and getting away from the thoughts of, you know, kind of unwinding from preaching so to speak, he sends me pictures. He's got chair rail up. He's got Wayne's coating up. I said, ' Man, carpentry work, if you're going to be a good carpenter, having the right tools is half the battle, isn't it? He said, "Praise the Lord." Cuz let me tell you, I remember when I used to try to build with wood and and I would take those big old finish nails, you know, they're about three and a half inches long. They say they're finish nails. And you try to drive them into wood and what's it do? It splits the wood. So you tear it out. You have to cut another board. You have to start all over. Not anymore. IT'S JUST POP POP POP. AND IT GOES THROUGH SO FAST AND SO QUICK THAT THE WOOD NEVER even knows it's been touched. The right equipment gets us ready for what we have need of in life. &gt;&gt; GOD EQUIPS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US WITH EXACTLY what you need tomorrow. You think, "I feel so insignificant. I feel I feel like I I'm insufficient in everything that I want to do." I promise you, God has equipped you with everything you have need of. You know, the having the right equipment is essential in any process or or progress of any endeavor. Our country was founded upon the right equipment. Do you realize that our country, the day that we live in, the hour that we live in, we we we out of the walking to get to the grocery store days, and we're out of the horse and buggy days. We're out of the out of the uh airplane age even. We can go somewhere just like that. They've got airplanes now that can fly, I think it's from uh from uh London to California or London to New York in about three hours. I think I'm not riding on that one. That's the government's airplane. But you know, equipment has revolutionized America as the way we know it. We have a cotton gin. There was a steam engine. Think about this. A light bulb, a telephone, an assembly line. They were all equipped to do a job. They have uh we we we have uh uh infrastructure like car uh uh uh roadways and railways, the train system. Do you realize all this happened within a within a span of about a hundred years? &gt;&gt; Think about this. The right equipment revolutionized the world that we know. In 1793, did you realize it was that long ago? 1793, Eli Whitley Whit Whitney, let me get his name right. Give credit where credit's due. ELI WHITNEY CREATED THE COTTON gin that revolutionized the textile world. John Deere come up with a plow in 1837 that would change the way people cultivated their lands. Can you imagine trying to grow enough food for the population we have today without modern equipment and technology? I still wonder where some of this food comes from. Paul can 3D print a banana. Where's our food coming from? The telegraph. There was a process for making steel and the process for a radio and a television, automobiles, airplanes. Think about all this that's happening all so quickly and so rapidly. But these inventions, they didn't just change industries. They reshaped American society, the work that we do, the lives we live, daytoday life, creating a modern world that we live in. But I want you to realize this. YOU SAY, "WHY ARE YOU BRINGING THAT IN?" I WANT YOU TO REALIZE THIS. I want you to realize today that THIS MORNING THAT ALL THAT IS WONDERFUL. ALL OF THAT SHAPED the world that we live in and MADE IT A WORLD FULL OF POSSIBILITIES. But long before the cotton gin, long before there WAS A RAILROAD, LONG BEFORE THERE WAS AN ETHERNET, LONG BEFORE THERE WAS AN IPHONE, GOD PLACED SOMETHING on the inside of the BELIEVER'S HEART CALLED FAITH. F AI T. And if you've got that faith this morning, HE SAID, "IF THOU CANST only believe, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE." WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RAILROADS and airplanes and iPhones. I'm talking about healings. I'M TALKING ABOUT DELIVERANCE. I'M TALKING ABOUT PRODALS COMING HOME. I'M TALKING ABOUT babies being healed. &gt;&gt; Cancer can't stand before it. &gt;&gt; Heart disease CANNOT STAND BEFORE IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT VERY STATEMENT, IF THOU CAST ONLY BELIEVE, all things are possible. What does that do for the believer? Brothers and sisters, it unlocks ALL THE POTENTIALS IN YOUR LIFE. It unlocks and it allows YOU TO OVERCOME YOUR LIMITATIONS. &gt;&gt; You can have your lost children. &gt;&gt; That's what that statement. Let's say that together. If thou canst only &gt;&gt; believe &gt;&gt; all things are possible. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. Now, do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Some of you do. Now, the rest of you say it with me this time because not all of you did. We're all going to say it or we'll stay right here. We're going to speak through positive confession right here. If thou canst only, &gt;&gt; if only &gt;&gt; believe &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE, &gt;&gt; all things are possible. &gt;&gt; YOU JUST UNLOCKED YOUR LIMITATIONS, BROTHERS AND SISTERS. YOU JUST SPOKE A POSITIVE. YOU JUST SAID, "ANYTHING THAT I HAVE NEED OF, GOD CAN DELIVER." HALLELUJAH. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, GOD ALWAYS EQUIPS HIS PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; You look over there and you got these big Philistines over there. And brother Brandham said there was always a fly in the ointment to Israel. Might say they're a thorn in their flesh. And here was those PHILISTINES OVER THERE, THE THESE Philistine people over there. AND THERE WAS A CHALLENGER OVER THERE BY THE NAME of Goliath. And the prophet said he was a big mammoth. Big fella. They said his fingers were 14 in long. Yeah. You. Yeah. Now listen here. This is our gentle giant. Okay. But I want you to realize something. I got I got pretty average size hands. I want you to look at this guy's Daniel. Oh, get him. Come here. Get him. Let's look at this guy. Put your hand up there to his. Turn around there where they can see. Now turn the other way. We got to see his hand. Yours is overshadowing. Thank you, buddy. Thank Thank you, Carson. Oh, wait. Come here, Carson. Come here. Listen one more time. How long is that finger? How long is that? Yeah. Let's Let's measure that. We should have done this at home, but I was afraid you wouldn't come. Huh? &gt;&gt; Okay. Four and a half. Four and a half inches. And you've seen how it dwarfed my hands and Gideon's hands. add 10 inches to that. This is a 12 inch ruler, right? You see, sometimes we talk about a giant, but we don't put it into perspective. This giant of a man that goes over there and he begin to talk and he begin to to brag and he be to proposition the people over there AND THAT'S THE WAY SATAN DOES. I'M BIGGER THAN YOU. YOU CAN'T overcome your habits. You can't overcome drugs. YOU CAN'T OVERCOME ALCOHOL. YOU CAN'T OVERCOME A lustful spirit. This is WHAT HE WAS CRYING ACROSS THE VALLEY. ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; I'M A GIANT AND YOU CAN'T defeat me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's a liar. You see, we recognize that. But the children of Israel was scared to death. Absolutely scared to death. AND THE PROPHET SAID THERE, IF THERE WAS ONE man in the entire nation of Israel that would have been equipped physically TO WHOOP THIS GIANT, that man was Saul. See, sometimes it's not always what we think. HE SAID THAT SAUL WAS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE ENTIRE ARMY. HE WAS WELL TRAINED. He was a master of maneuvering. He knew how to handle THE SPEAR. HE KNEW HOW TO USE A SHIELD TO KNOCK OFF THE DARTS AND KNOCK OFF THE the the the swords and knock off the lick of the swords. He was the trainer of men. He said, "But he being the largest man of the nation, the best train that there was, he was a coward." He said, "But on one day," I said, "On one day." On one day, WAY BACK FROM THE BACKSIDE OF THE DESERT COME THIS LITTLE RUDDY LOOKING DRAWLED UP KNOT CALLED Jesse's son, David. HE SAID THIS LITTLE SHEEPKIN COAT ON HIM. HE was packing a slingshot in his hand. H I told you God would equip you with anything you had need of. And here he comes, this giant on the other side of the valley crying out all that he's going to do and all he's going to devour and all he's GOING TO DESTROY. HE MADE HIS BRAG at the wrong time on the wrong day &gt;&gt; because he was in earshot &gt;&gt; of a real warrior. &gt;&gt; He was in earshot and he was SITTING THERE AND DAVID LOOKED OVER AND HE SAID, "YOU MEAN TO TELL ME?" &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE THESE GREAT MEN, THESE MEN WHO WERE BATTLE TRAINED soldiers standing and listening to that day after DAY AFTER DAY? WHY DO WE as Christians listen to the devil? &gt;&gt; Rise up, David. &gt;&gt; Day after day, they're listening to this and LISTENING TO THEM DEFY the armies of a living God. And this little man, this little man, little ruddy man, takes up the challenge. You see, David knew God in a way that the entire nation of Israel had never experienced. It's not how broad your shoulders are. It's not about how much money you got. It's not about how many people you know around the world. Come on. But what it's about is if you had an experience with him. &gt;&gt; Have you had an experience with him? You see, David may have looked like a boy, BUT SAUL WAS TALKING TO A MAN. &gt;&gt; What was he 14? Is that what we've been told? I'm right. Am I right, brother? 14. Is that right? You've been doing this for a long time. Help me out. I think that's right. 14. And and and and THE PROPHET SAID HE MAY HAVE LOOKED like a boy, BUT BUT SAUL WAS TALKING TO a man that had experience. He knew WHAT IT WAS TO EXPERIENCE GOD IN HIS TIME OF NEED. He knew what it was like TO EXPERIENCE HAVING TO CALL GOD ON THE SCENE IN SITUATIONS THAT WERE COMPLETELY OUT of his hands. Come on, church. We go through things in life THAT ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF OUR HANDS. BUT WE HAVE THE ABILITY AS CHILDREN OF GOD TO CALL GOD ON THE scene in whatever our hour of despair is. And he looks at it AND HE SAYS, "SIR, I WAS TAKING CARE OF MY DADDY'S SHEEP. I'm about my father's business." &gt;&gt; Come on, church. WE LIVE EVERY SINGLE DAY OF OUR LIVES ABOUT OUR FATHER'S BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE LIVING for your business, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU'RE LIVING for about your father's business, that's where it's at. That's where you find your overcoming power. AND HE BEGAN TO TELL HIM, "ONE DAY BACK THERE, A LION CAME IN ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HE GRABBED ONE OF MY SHEEP AND HE RUN OFF WITH IT. AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I DID. I WENT AND I TOOK MY SLINGSHOT. Can you imagine this lion running off with a lamb in his mouth as hard as he could go? David didn't cry. David didn't moan. David said, "What did God give me?" Oh, I got my sling. And he said, "I WENT BACK, SAUL, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I DID. I WENT AND AND I SNATCHED my lamb back out of his mouth. And when that lion got up and tried TO RUN OFF, I GRABBED HIM BY THE THROAT AND I SLAYED THAT THING." &gt;&gt; WELL, that was just a fluke, Dave. Uh uh David, that was just, you know, don't don't get all excited. You got lucky. I didn't GET LUCKY BECAUSE IT WASN'T TOO LONG AFTER THAT, HERE COME A BEAR AND THAT BEAR COME DOWN THERE AND THAT BEAR took away one of my lambs and I knocked that thing down with a ROCK FROM MY SLING. LET ME TELL YOU, GOD HAS GIVEN ME THE TOOLS I NEED FOR THE TRADE I LIVE. AND AS CHRISTIANS, WE HAVE PRAYER, WE HAVE FASTING, WE HAVE DEDICATION BEFORE GOD. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't hurt any of us to fast a little more. You know, they I've been reading and they, you know, they they say everything, but they say when you fast, there's an obligation to meet the needs you're fasting over. But I like to eat. It won't kill you when you pray. Your voice is heard in heavens. Your voice is heard. Angels hear. Angels respond. Angels report. Come on church. So if we will find ourselves using the weapons that we have, PRAYER, FASTING, PRAISE, I wasn't going to go here, but I guess I will. Here we are. You know, when the praises go up, the blessings come down. &gt;&gt; Have you ever noticed that? We go to phenomenal meetings. We have phenomenal meetings. Last year here, people listened and they heard the word. They received the word. They were feeding at the table. But when did the freedom come? What would have happened if we' have sang one song and went out the back doors? You see, we don't we don't allow ourselves time to enter into worship and to give praise to God for all that he's done. you know that we don't train ourselves to to praise. But let me just tell you, if you find yourselves entering into a place of praise TO WHERE YOU DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR NEIGHBOR THINKS, let me tell you, I like to sing, but I can't sing. But I don't care what you think. &gt;&gt; Well, to a certain degree. But when I find myself shut away and I'll close my eyes and I don't think about the words, but I just let the words come and I begin to raise my hands AND I BEGIN TO PRAISE AND WHILE I'M SINGING, I BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT God and I BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT WHAT GOD IS DOING THROUGH THE SONG AND THROUGH THE MUSIC AND I BEGIN TO PRAISE HIM FOR ALL HE IS. THERE'S WHEN THE BLESSINGS BEGIN TO FLOW. YOU LET A CHURCH SERVICE THAT HAS SOME HAS SOME FLOW at it and see if the people don't turn loose. See if the people don't find some freedom. &gt;&gt; But we harness that. Why do we harness that? Are we embarrassed? I don't know. Why do we harness that? Why do we Why do we shut that off? Well, we've been here for an hour and a half. Let me tell you the way I'm preaching right now. We can just go for about three or four hours because that's the way I FEEL IN THE PRESENCE THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. TIME DOES NOT MATTER WHEN YOU'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD. And when we BEGIN TO POUR OUT OUR PRAISE AND WE BEGIN TO POUR OUT OUR THANKS THROUGH SONG AND THROUGH WORSHIP, GOD BEGINS TO POUR AND POUR AND POUR AND HE OPENS UP THE windows of heaven. AND THAT'S WHEN YOU FIND &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE YOU'VE ALLOWED GOD TO COME IN. YOU'VE ALLOWED GOD TO WOO OVER THE congregation and you have caught him on the scene. Hallelujah. Brothers and sisters, it don't take a lot of thinking, but what it takes is a humble heart. It takes a humble heart. And David looks at Saul and he says, "Listen, your servant, how many servants do we have in here?" Amen. If you're not serving, you better re-evaluate. Living the life of Christ is serving others. Am I right? &gt;&gt; YOUR SERVANT. HE DIDN'T SAY YOUR GREATEST WARRIOR, the hero of Israel, the greatest shepherd, but Saul, your servant, your servant will go and fight this Philistine. I'm going to fight him. AND OF COURSE, SAUL LOOKS AT HE SAID, "I CAN'T LET YOU GO. I can't let you go like that, David. YOU'RE BUT A BOY. ALL YOU'VE GOT IS A SLINGSHOT. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LITTLE MORE WEAPONRY. Let me give you some equipment. Here, come pick out your sword. Pick out your shield. Pick out your armor. Pick out PICK OUT YOUR PICK OUT YOUR your your vest, your coat of male. You know what I found? I stepped on the scales the other day and I found out that the armor of God is pretty heavy. Some of you got Some of you'll get that. Some of you will never get that. But here's David. I can't do this. I can't stand. I CAN'T MOVE LIKE THIS. I CAN'T WALK LIKE THIS. I TAKE THIS THING OFF OF ME. I've never proved this kind of equipment. I HAVE NEVER PUT THIS STUFF ON IN MY LIFE. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THIS STUFF. But what I do know, what I DO KNOW IS WHAT GOD HAS PLACED IN MY hand and in my life to defeat every enemy that is before me. AND THAT IS THIS SLING. AND brothers and sisters, FOR US, THAT IS THE WORD OF GOD. We need that KIND OF FAITH. WE NEED THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE IN THE RESURRECTED JESUS CHRIST OF OUR DAY. BROTHERS and sisters, IT'S NOT THEOLOGY. IT'S GOD. IT'S GOD AND NEOLOGY. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, he said, "It's neology, not theology." And he takes this little slingshot. He said it was all he knew anything about. But he knowed that God could use that thing for a purpose. and how much it meant to save the whole army of Israel with a slingshot. God equips his people. God equips his people. In the Garden of Eden, Brother Random says, God, he he knew his enemy and and he knew his enemy and he knew all of the attacks of his enemy. But God being infinite and an infinite God that he was, he he knew all things before they ever was. Hallelujah. If you know all things before they ever were, can you be defeated? If I read tomorrow's newspaper, I'd be a multi-gazillionaire. You would, too. Don't tell me you wouldn't. Don't look at me like that. You'd be looking at that stock market. You'd be looking say, "What's up tomorrow?" cuz I'm going to put it in today. But if you knew tomorrow's news today, how different WOULD YOU LIVE? AND THAT'S THE WAY CHRIST WAS. HE LOOKED AT THAT. He could see the end from the beginning. And he knew that he would have children on this earth, HIS OWN BLESSED CHILDREN. HE said that he knew HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE THE BEST for them. &gt;&gt; That's you. He could see you. He could see your shortcomings. He could see your afflictions. He could see your failures. He could see even your complexes. H. He said, "But he's a father. He's a parent." And he said just like any earthly parent and parenthood originated in God. He was the first parent. He said seeing what Satan would do and how he would act, he gave his children and provided for them the best thing that he could provide for them. Knowing the enemy's attack what it would be. God fortified. Are you with me? He built a fortress around you. And he fortified you, his children. He said he he's fortified you with with the word of God. HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW TO EQUIP his people. So if we notice the very first thing that God equipped us with in the beginning being infinite, he knew what it would take to defeat Satan any place, anytime, anywhere, on any conditions. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I can't beat him because I'M ADDICTED TO THIS. I can't beat him because I can't quit looking at this. I can't BEAT HIM BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THE WORD SAYS. &gt;&gt; The word of deliverance SAYS THAT GOD GAVE YOU THE equipment &gt;&gt; being INFINITE AND KNOWING WHAT your weaknesses were. He gave the equipment to defeat Satan anytime, any place, anywhere, on any condition. And he says, "I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM something right here." And he didn't turn around and say, "But I may study this out and give him something a little better in a few years." God don't change. If he could defeat Satan in the Garden of Eden, if he could defeat Satan in David's time, if he could defeat Satan in the in the lion's den, if he could defeat Satan in the fiery furnace, are you with me? &gt;&gt; He can defeat Satan today on anything that he throws at you. AND HE SAID, "BUT GOD IN THE BEGINNING gave his CHILDREN AN ATOMIC WEAPON." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AN ATOMIC WEAPON. HE SAID it because he's an infinite God and he sees that there's going to be conflict. You're going to have conflict. THERE'S GOING TO BE DAYS THE DEVIL is going to just whoop you up. Anybody tells you he don't, they lying to you. You tell that preacher to quit lying before he gets in the pit. That's what I say. But being an infinite God, he knows you're going to go into battle. And God equipped HIS CHILDREN WITH THE RIGHT kind of ammunition, THE RIGHT KIND OF ATTACK, THE RIGHT kind of everything they had need of. Now listen, THAT WOULD SWEEP THEM ALL THE WAY from Eden to the rapture. &gt;&gt; You see, it wasn't just overcoming power in the garden. NOW, IT WASN'T JUST OVERCOMING POWER in the lion's den or in the in the fiery furnace and those things we've TALKED ABOUT. IT'S OVERCOMING POWER IN your life, Paul, &gt;&gt; Daniel, Courtney. It's overcoming power in your life, young people. WELL, JOHN, IT'S OVERCOMING POWER IN YOUR LIFE. In my life, it's overcoming power. the atomic weapon that would sweep through all the way from Eden to the rapture. AND HE SAID, "WHAT WAS IT?" It's the word. &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD IS WHAT IT WAS. THE WORD THAT defeats Satan. It's the word that'll feed him anywhere, any place, any time, on any condition. And he said, "There is no substitute for it. &gt;&gt; Don't think you're going to change the program. Just follow the word. Just follow the word. And he said it's not WAS IT WASN'T JUST FOR ONE OR TWO OF THEM. NO, it wasn't just for them back there in Sister Becky. It wasn't just for them, but it was for everyone. Every believer, he said, HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE THE WORD AND FIGHT every enemy anywhere that you meet him. &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm in a place I DON'T EVEN KNOW. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF ANYBODY CARES. MEET THE ENEMY RIGHT THERE WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND SEE IF YOU don't win. Face any battle YOU HAVE WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND SEE. I CHALLENGE YOU, CHURCH TO SEE IF YOU'RE NOT VICTORIOUS. YOU SAY, "WELL, I can't overcome this." Take it to the cross. &gt;&gt; Take to the word. &gt;&gt; Take it to the WORD AND SAY THAT BY HIS STRIPES, I'M HEALED. GOD SAID THAT HE WOULD DELIVER ME FROM ANYTHING, &gt;&gt; any infirmity, &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, that ain't a habit," is it? Ain't it? However you want to word it. Anything that's hindering you, anything that's that that is bringing you down, anything that is tearing you down, that's an enemy. It's an infirmity. &gt;&gt; If you've got a habit that is destroying your liver, &gt;&gt; that's an infirmity being built in your body. IF YOU'VE GOT A HABIT THAT'S DESTROYING YOUR LUNGS, &gt;&gt; that's an infirmity that is brewing in your body. &gt;&gt; And he can deliver you from those things. &gt;&gt; Moses, we're going to take we're going to hit on Moses and then we'll wrap up. Is that good? We got time for Moses. &gt;&gt; Moses was out there and he he began to look and God spoke to Moses as Moses was out on the back side of the desert. And Moses was back on the back side of the desert and and God comes to him and he says, "Moses, I have seen the suffering of my people and I remembered my promise." And Moses says, "Well, hallelujah. I'm glad you did." And God says, "And I I'm going to send you back to where you came from." Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This ain't the way it's going to work, God. You see the affliction. You hear their cries. You know what they're going through. I'm already out of that bondage. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; No. Moses, I've equipped you. I've equipped you to go and deliver the children in my name. I've equipped you to go right through there. Moses began to do what a lot of us would have done. Complain, murmur, and complain. I don't want to do, let me tell you. 3:30 this morning when my alarm was about to go off, I didn't want to do. You see, sometimes when we don't want to pray, it's just because we don't want to do. But you know what I did? I did. And God is equipped and God has answered. God is moving. Brothers, I I can't preach like this. I I don't have the capabilities. If you could only see what goes through the minds as a preacher's preaching, THE RAPID PACE AND the speed that things go through. Yes, I've got words ON A PAPER, BUT THOUSANDS OF WORDS THAT I'LL SAY ARE NEVER ON THIS PAPER. &gt;&gt; And it's because you prayed &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE WE GIVE AND WE GAVE AND GOD IS OBLIGATED TO MEET US for to defeat enemy at any time, any place, anywhere. Satan, you don't have no rights IN THIS BUILDING. YOU DON'T HAVE NO RIGHTS IN OUR HOME. YOU DON'T HAVE NO RIGHTS in our children. &gt;&gt; You're a defeated foe. I'm here to tell you this morning. &gt;&gt; And Moses began to complain. And Moses didn't want to go. AND FOR 40 YEARS, THINK ABOUT THIS. MOSES, and listen the way I love the way the prophet says this. For 40 years, he was trained in Pharaoh's house. He was trained to be uh the next ruler in line. He was the most theologically sound person. BUT HE SAID FIVE MINUTES, five minutes surrendered into the presence of the fire of God. HE WAS A BETTER EQUIPPED than all the equipment in the world could ever make him. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE NEED TO TAKE FIVE MINUTES IN THE PRESENCE of God AND SAY, "GOD, USE ME. &gt;&gt; GOD, CLEAN OUT ANYTHING IN MY LIFE THAT IS HINDERING ME FROM DOING WHAT you want me to do." &gt;&gt; FIVE MINUTES. WHAT WHAT WOULD AN HOUR DO? &gt;&gt; Are we preaching now? WHAT WOULD AN HOUR DO? WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD JUST 30 MINUTES DO IF YOU GOT IT down on YOUR KNEES BEFORE GOD DAY in day out before noon before and BEFORE YOU GO TO BED? WHAT WOULD 30 MINUTES do if five minutes erased all the knowledge? &gt;&gt; You see, we got to get ourselves out of the way. &gt;&gt; And you don't get yourselves out of the way by doing what you want to do. You get yourself out of the way by getting on your knees and doing a little neology. and say, "God, erase my thinking out of the way. God, make me what you would have me to be." &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes God requires us to do the most ridiculous things. the most ridiculous things. And here comes Moses and he runs home and grabs Zapora and the prophet said he set her a straddle of that mule with a kid on each hip. Now he might be picking his eyeballs up. What were we talking about earlier? Come on, Sephora. Get the youngans. We're going on a journey. How we going? You got us a Cadillac. You got us a bus. What we got? Get on that mule. Where's the kids going to ride? On your hip. Huh? Are you kidding me, Moses? You see, it looked ridiculous, didn't it? It looked ridiculous into the eyes of even Moses and Zapora. They said there he's got him up on a mule now. Got her on a mule with a kid on each side. And here he is 80 years old, whiskers blowing in the wind with a stick with a stick. Where are you going, Moses? Where are you going, Moses? Well, I'll tell you. I'm going down to Egypt. I thought you done left that place. You said you was never going back. You know what? You never say never to God. &gt;&gt; Woo! You will pay FOR THAT ONE. &gt;&gt; LORD, I'M NEVER GOING TO PREACH AGAIN. How many sermons ago was that? Never say never. I'm never GOING TO SING. YOU MAY be the next lead singer in the choir. You may be the next song leader. WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MOSES? I'M GOING DOWN to Egypt. Why? Don't you know what's going on down there? Yeah, I know what's going on. I've been there. I've lived it. I know. BUT I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THERE AND I'M going to take over. &gt;&gt; Ha ha. Lol. Smiley face as Tommy sends you. Squirting eyes. Squirting eyes. squirting eyes. It took me forever to figure out what she was doing. I was like, "What is that?" Then I figured out it's the crying and his cries. Anyway, you're going to YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHAT, MOSES? I'M GOING TO TAKE OVER BECAUSE GOD SAID SO. GOD TOLD ME THAT I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THERE AND TAKE OVER. SEE, IT DON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE OF HOW unreal it seems, how ridiculous that it seems, how unfitting it seems, how impossible it seems. BUT WHEN GOD SAYS IT, we believe it AND THAT SETTLES IT. GOD MOVES on the scene of his believers. AND HE TOLD HIM, "YOU'RE GOING TO GO DOWN THERE." AND THEY SAID, "HOW YOU GOING TO TAKE OVER? WHAT KIND OF WEAPON you going to use? A stick. A stick. Don't you think, Moses, that's a little bit of a weak weapon for what you're about to face? God said he would equip me. &gt;&gt; You can't even talk, Moses. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SPEAK TO PHARAOH WHEN YOU GET ALL nervous up there and you begin to sweat in the armpits and and he's questioning you these hard questions and YOU'RE STANDING BEFORE PHARAOH'S COURT? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO EVEN SPEAK? HE SAID he would give me a spokesman. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE WOULD PROVIDE MY VOICE. HE WOULD PROVIDE A WEAPON. HE WOULD PROVIDE everything that I had need of to GET THOSE CHILDREN BACK OUT OF THE the the garbage pits of Egypt. &gt;&gt; So, if you're living in Egypt and you're sucking on garlic and onions, it's time to quit eating that cuz it stinks. Let God equip you. And Moses goes down there and he goes down there and it may look like it's real insignificant. It looks like it's real insignificant and and nothing can ever happen, nothing can ever come out of it, but when he steps before Pharaoh and God, I said God begins to prove himself. One plague. Oh, you don't ain't enough to convince you, Pharaoh? Two plagues. Oh, you still don't believe I'm real? Three plagues. Four, five, six. How many was it, Brother Troy? You a theologian? 10. That's what I thought. 10. Do you believe me now that your son's laying dead? Do you believe me now that Moses was my spokesman? Do you believe me now when that stick that he was that he was packing went down and swallowed up the very serpents that you had? DO YOU BELIEVE ME NOW, PHARAOH? &gt;&gt; How many of us this morning could look and we need to say we need to get before we need to get before Satan and say, "DO YOU BELIEVE ME NOW, SATAN? I DON'T FALL to your ws no more &gt;&gt; because IN THIS HOUR I'VE BEEN MADE MORE THAN A CONQUEROR. I'VE TAKEN over everything that you took away from me. I thought about that song Brother Andrew sang last night. I went to the enemy camp and I took back what he stole from me. &gt;&gt; I thought that's what we got to do. God has equipped us with the ability to take back. If you've lost your joy, take it back. If you've lost your love for for your brotherhood, &gt;&gt; take it back. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, ain't nobody friendly TO ME." SHOW YOURSELF FRIENDLY. &gt;&gt; You know, I found out the hard way. That's the way it work. I think ain't nobody loved me for years, but it was me that was a stuck up, stubborn snoot. Hey, &gt;&gt; but it's the truth. BUT WHEN I STARTED FINDING MYSELF BEING FRIENDLY, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; God will Oh, God will move on the scene. If you need more love, show love to somebody. If you Here we go. If you need more money, &gt;&gt; give a little bit to somebody. &gt;&gt; Pay your tithe. Pay your offering. &gt;&gt; Give a little extra on the tip when you really ain't got it to give. And see what happens. &gt;&gt; See what happens. I challenge you. &gt;&gt; My wife, Lord, I love her with everything in me, but she thinks a $2 tip sometimes is too much. I said, "I'm not doing that. &gt;&gt; They working hard and they don't get paid nothing. If they take care of me, I'm going to take care of them." &gt;&gt; So, I kind of set it in my mind, you know, they say, "Well, 10% then somebody said 10%'s good for Jesus. It's good for the waiter." If I go in and I eat a $10 meal and I give 10%, what is that? Who said that over here? You start, boy. A dollar. Yeah. I don't know why we're going this way, but we're going. If you need to to be blessed, bless somebody. I made it. I made it kind of a little thing in my mind. I thought if I can't give 25% to the waiter, the waitress for the meal that I get, I don't need to be spending money to eat out. And you know what happened? The funny thing happened. I go back to those restaurants now. I never run out of chips. I never run out of salsa. I never run out of Coke. Zero. Bring it on. Bring it on. Would you like anything else, sir? No, I think I'm good. Are you sure? Do you want me to top off your drink? No, I think I'm okay. I'll bring you some if you want it. You see what I'm saying? If you want to be blessed, bless others. You want to see I if you if you want to see your life be fulfilled, be fulfilling to others. &gt;&gt; God equips his people. God equipped Moses to be a leader. God equipped Joshua with a vision. God equipped Esther and gave her courage. God equipped Daniel and gave him an equipment to interpret dreams that would change the world history. He gave Paul, this is one we don't like. He gave Paul the ability, the equipment to endure trials and training. I got I got that mastered. What I'm trying to get to us this morning, Abraham's seed. Abraham's seed. It's not about you. It's not about me. It's not about a lineage, but it's about being in Christ. It's about being in Christ and letting God equip you with what you have need of. Sometimes he'll use your weakness. Sometimes he'll useh provisions. He'll give you a skill. He'll give you a resource. He'll give you a way to complete some task. Sometimes he uses transformation. He said, "I know you guys are fishermen, but if you'll come and follow me, I'll make you fishers of men. Get rid of this stinky mess we're in. Who wants to go around smelling like fish all day? Let's go save some souls, brothers." Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, the power of transformation. Hallelujah. Let's stand to our feet. We got to find a place to stop. Musicians, if you'll come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. God is good. You know, Jesus, Jesus's death was the greatest equiptor of believers the world has ever known. Because upon that death on Calvary, there was an offering. There was an atonement made for your sins, for your shortcomings, for your failures. There was an atonement made. And in that atonement, there was a purifying that took place that said, "I take away all of sin's powers. I take away all of sin's powers and now we're going to defeat death, hell, the grave and devil and anything he throws at you. That's what the empowerment and that's what the equipping of the the cross of Calvary and the bloodshed of Jesus Christ did for you and I. Aren't you thankful for that this morning? That it gives you the power of freedom OVER SIN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BOUND BY THE THINGS THAT USED to bind you. Just lay it down. lay it down and speak the word OVER IT. THAT IS THAT IS WHAT GOD DID AT CALVARY. IT IT broke the legal hold the laws because before faith came but after faith came the laws were broken. You can have your deliverance. You can have all those things. That's what Jesus did. Jesus on the cross, he gave us healing. It gave us peace. It gave us righteousness. And most importantly, it gave us the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day, for your blessings, for your love. Lord, we thank you for stepping on the scene this morning.

And if there's anybody here that would just just say, you know, I I've been struggling with this in my life and I've been struggling maybe over here and and I've been wandering into into places I shouldn't go in my life and I I haven't quite been that real example that I should have been. And you just want to raise your hand up and say, "God, forgive me. I repent of my shortcomings. I forgive them. forgive for I I I want to I want you to forgive me of my failures. Hallelujah. God bless those hands. Honest hearts. It's honest hearts is where God moves. If you won't be honest with God, he can't do nothing for you. You want to overcome, confess your faults between you and God. If no man's involved, confess it between you and God and see if he don't come in and tenderize that heart of yours. Hallelujah. God bless you. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord for moving in our lives Lord in our church and our young people and our homes the families knitting together as the day approaches your word says forsake not the assembly and Lord I see in this hour people are coming together there's a closeness there's a unity that's taking place between the bride of Jesus Christ. All around the world and in the United States and all around the world, there's a unity that's taking place. We know, we sense, we feel something's happening. Continue to use us, Lord. Use each vessel sitting here this morning that they may be a witness. That maybe maybe they'll be the one that witnesses to that very last one. Hallelujah. We love you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. We lift your name this morning. The lovely name of Jesus. Amen. Amen. What you playing, Sister Becky? My Jesus. My Jesus. It's not that one. Tell me about my Jesus. Yeah, we can do that.

All your hearts now. Oh, it's your season to be blessed. God made you a promise. You stood the test. He'll open up a window and pour you out a blessing. It's your season to be blessed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're certainly in a season of blessing and God is so good to us and you know and we just given a note here and very very serious and sad situation that was just handed to me and you hate to have to deliver a message like this but this family needs prayers. This is from brother Devin says, "Please pray for my former co-worker's family. The 9-year-old daughter found her 14-year-old sister who had committed suicide this morning. That's a tough situation. I don't know this person. You don't know this person. But I can't imagine what that family must be feeling in this hour. Especially the 9-year-old. It's found her sister in this situation. So, let's just go before the Lord and ask that the Lord would be with them at this time. Heavenly Father, there's things in life that we just completely have to be honest and say we don't understand. But what we know is that the enemy is real. The enemy is real in the hour that we are living in and he's no respector of person. No doubt this something has caused this young lady of 14, just a just a mere young child, Lord, to feel like for some reason life wasn't worth living. We thank you Lord for allowing us to be appreciative in life itself. But Lord, Satan had pulled the wool over her eyes. No doubt because a child of 14 just in her youth, she had so much to live for, it would appear. But something had caused the distress and influenced her to commit an act that you just hate to hear, Lord. So Lord, we just pray this morning for the family. There's a mother and a father that's grieving and no doubt questioning why. What happened? What could we have done? There'll be many, many, many questions that go through their minds in the days to come, in the weeks and even years. Lord, I don't know if a person would ever get over it on this side, Lord. Lord, my heart breaks for that little girl that found her sister in that condition, Lord. And Lord, I just ask this morning, Lord, that you would go and you would comfort her. Don't ever let her think she was at fault or that she failed in some way because it's a hard load that she'll have to carry and a burden she'll bear. But Lord, we ask Lord that you will be her burden bearer this morning. May she find peace and solace in you, Lord. If she don't know you, may may she find you through this, Lord, and the family, Lord. We commit it into your hands, Lord, asking that you would just move in a mighty way on this scene. We commit it to you trusting and believing that you'll handle the situation in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Brother David, if you've got a couple psalms or a song, the goodness of God this morning. I love you, Lord, for your mercy never fails me. And all my days I've been held in your hand. From the moment that I wake up till I lay my head, I rule in the goodness of God.
