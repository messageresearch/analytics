we must be speaking for him Sunday morning amen and then probably making the trip back Sunday afternoon back come back Sunday late Sunday night probably because it's probably about a seven hour trip a minute so will you remember us in prayer as we travel first go to the wedding over there and so forth and then on down amen so praise the Lord amen that's our heads Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and we're so grateful to be able to assemble ourselves together again Lord in your name knowing god where two or three are gathered Lord Jesus there you are in the midst we realize lost God and believe truly that you'll take control of the service and that you'll have your way Lord and that you'll just take the word father that I feel you've quicked upon my heart to speak apply it to the people now in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen and amen let's turn our bibles if you will amen over to um one of them is going to be in second chronicles and the other one is going to be in the book of Luke amen so we'll go to the Book of Luke 17. verse 11 of Luke 17 verse 11 and he came to pass as he went to Jerusalem did he path through the midst of Samaria and Galilee a certain Village there met him 10 men that were lepers which stood afar off and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priests and he came to pass as they went that they were cleansed boys glorified God and fell down on his face at his his feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan and Jesus answered and there were not found that that returned to give glory to God save this Stranger in second chronicles 29 he was atturing the time of Hezekiah King being King and they were making an anatomy atonement for Israel amen making a lot of different sacrifices but in the 29th chapter of second chronicles and in verse 31 then Hezekiah hi out answered and said that now you have consecrated yourselves unto the Lord come near and bring thank offerings amen amen look at that word thank all priests into the house of the Lord and the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings amen as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings may God that is blessed blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen amen foreign give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you in everything give thanks amen amen title tonight is thank you Lord thank you Lord amen but basically I'll be honest with you it's kind of a feeling amen it's kind of a feeling that I had and just the way that I felt amen and I begin to hurt and you know we're always asking God for more we're designing hiring things from him a lot we have a lot of needs that we have and get from him in that right amen man we need victories we need triumphs we need that we need encouragement we need all of this but so many times the things that when we come and they will approach almighty God it is with the request or a desire or asking for something but very few times do we have a service Amen to where our codal focus is on just thanking God just thanking him amen because I got to thinking when we get over there and when we get over to the other side you know and I like that song and boy I'll tell you when I begin to think about there's so many songs comes to mind and man I can only imagine what I will do amen when I stand before him you know under what will I do amen and so forth uh dance before you what will I figured you won't have to ask for more strength and uh to overcome this and overcome that but when you fall before him think about what you're gonna do and over in the Book of Revelations find that Thanksgiving is a part of worship isn't that right thanks giving is a part of worship so every time you thank God or you say Amen or you say hallelujah it's all praising God it's always thanking God now notice that thanks and praise go hand in hand not only thank him but praise him for his goodness so tonight I thought Ma I'll just put a list of things down and we'll go down through here and think about all the things that we can thank him for now the feeling like I said that I had you know and normally you don't go by feelings as far as preaching the word but as long as your feelings match the word I think it's okay amen and I thought you know God you have been so good to me now I'm in that song There's oh you have been oh so good to me that even a song that says that isn't that right how good God has been to you you know I thought you know what is what is your answer if I ask you tonight is how good has God been to you how good she been to you how good's he been to you you know and I think the correct answer that probably most of us would give would be better than I deserve he had been and when we get over there we're just gonna think I just wanna I just I'm gonna fall down before him and just thank him thank you Lord Jesus I don't ever have to have a prayer meeting anymore I don't have to never have uh you know ask for strength for this for that and the other be I won't have to never have a victory anymore because we've come past all of that now it's all in the past and for thousands of years we're just going to give him glory and honor and thanks the Bible talks about how that we're to give it he is God a great God and greatly to be praised before we go down the list I want to look at something that David said amen as we look at this it's in first Chronicles these things when I begin to think about it this this message so I thought about that song and I just wanna thank you Lord you know forget it I just wanna thank you Lord for letting me hear your word how many Clap That amen what have I done to deserve such Glory that's revealed in me amen I just wanna thank you Lord God it's so good sometimes until all I want to do all I want to do is love him amen all I want to do is praise you praise him praise him in the morning praise him in the noon died Praise Him in the evening praise him till the sun goes down amen now notice what David says then on that day David delivered first this Psalm to thank the Lord into the hand of Asif and his Brethren give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people in other words that's what we do here at church isn't it we talk about his deeds the great Deeds of stopping the Sun and the Moon a man of taking the Lions and and bears and killing them and goliathus that gets lained in front of his children amen these great Deeds that God does amen make known his deeds give thanks unto the Lord amen sing unto him sing Psalms unto him taught me of all of his wondrous works amen over in verse 23 it says Sing unto the Lord Earth show forth from day to day his salvation amen declare his glory among the Heath then and his serverless Works among all nations for great is urgent and amen also to be feared above all gods for all the gods of the people are Idols but the Lord made the heavens Glory and Honor are in his presence strength and Badness are in his place give unto the Lord eat kindreds of the people given to the Lord glory and strength give to the Lord the glory due to his name my my and I thought boy oh boy I'll tell you what I I just don't think that we do sometimes give him truly the glory that's due to his name amen when brother John remember when we was out in the world he said you know I'm there's a song He said lime I'm living forgiving the devil his dues amen people that are out there living to give the devil his dues amen and I'll tell you what it isn't a whole lot murder they don't get much out of it amen death and sorrow and everything else but here it says that give God glory that's due to him amen that's what I want to do tonight is just give God the glory that's due to his name bring it all free amen praise the Lord for him and Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness I mean every time that we come to church you come to church to bring a sacrifice and that song says we bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart I will enter his courts with praise that's right praise praise the Lord we go to a football game or a softball gamer uh maybe Michael Jordan back in the day you know and man he can Grinch slam dunk it more than people screaming they're giving him glory glorifying a man spacing a man but God says bring praises to Him thing isn't that the truth give Glory unto the Lord that's due to his name bring it all free don't just sit there and quiet don't do nothing no make no sack with the sacrifice of our lips the Bible says giving praise to his name praise the Lord amen oh my can't you wait we're done Debbie can't you wait to get over the other side back in them Hills somewhere amen and just praise the Lord praise God you're gonna hear me I'll be more loud I'm gonna be louder over there but I'm not gonna wait to start saying him and praising him till I get over there we're gonna start over here start right here start tonight giving him praise somebody say Amen somebody Oma if y'all notice this this you study that chapter that we talked about it was a free will offering of thanks and so forth because they did it from the heart the Bible says they weren't forced to it no it was a free will hey man I like that an offering of bringing sacrifice bring an offering and a sacrifice of thanks man did you know you can't go to the grocery store but what the tellers say thank you right thank you for coming by thank you for buying from uh thank you thank you somebody does anything thank you hey how many know we got a lot of think you're welcome you're welcome but the last time we don't come stop and say Lord thank you thank you thank you thank you Jesus for all that you have done for me and and David he wrote a song of Thanksgiving amen praise the Lord in everything over in Thessalonians Paul said in everything give thanks praise be the God be it how many knows it shows appreciation for what God has done amen let's read on all right now fear before him and the beauty of Holiness verse 30 pure before him all the Earth the world also shall be stable that it be not moved let the heavens be glad and then let the Earth rejoice and let men say among the Nations the Lord Reina oh let the sea Roar and the fullness thereof let's the fields rejoice and all that is therein then shall all the trees of the word sing out at the presence of the Lord because he cometh to judge the earth oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good amen God is good all the time amen how many believe God is good God's been good I mean has God's been good to you oh when you think about how good God has been to him we have no room to complain amen God is good for God is good in his mercy endureth forever oh say ye save us our god of our salvation and gather us together and Deliver Us from the Heathen that they may give to thy holy name and glory in thy praise blessed be the lord of the god of Israel forever and ever and all the people said amen and he says and the people praise the Lord and the people praise the Lord are you all ready to praise the Lord tonight or not that's what we come for we didn't come here to tie here down with Byler and and we're here to praise the Lord we're here to say thank you Jesus don't worry about asking but he's on the other right now let's just give God praise and glory and say thank you Lord and I think about that song and that first one I thank you Lord for saving my soul for making me whole thank you Lord I believe it's time I was so down and out but now you made me want to shout amen he brought me out of the Maori clay he set my feet on the Rock to stay I made that for that see we always want something new we're always wanting something else instead of really appreciating the simple things that he's giving us already [Music] amen how many bleeds that praise be to God I'm here you know before you go to praising God or shouting or dancing there's really something has to be behind it don't there has to be a reason for it has to be a reason for it and how many knows that there's plenty of reasons we want to look at some of those some of those reasons why we want to thank him amen one of the first things that I thought about was that when he was on the cross thank you Lord because when you was on the cross I was on your mind aren't you glad that when he was dying he was thinking about you and others are how many how many thankful that he was thinking of you before the foundation of the world he had you in his mind he was thought about you before the foundation of the world thank Lord amen but when he went on the cross he paid oh I'm so grateful I'm so thankful for the blood oh I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me thank you Jesus amen thank you Lord for what you did on Calvary how good that he has been God been he has been to you amen listen oh my then I thought about you know another thing is oh my when we just think begin to think he says you know uh he said one place he says you can um how was the word used not sympathized but he you can you can think about what I'm telling you can't really think about the word but when he was young he said there's things that bothered other kids or bothered you but it didn't bother anybody else remember that he's talking about he says that was teeth laying down amen and he says it wasn't just no accident we didn't get saved God didn't save you by accident amen you didn't just happen upon it neither did you uh say well I just want to serve God no no you can't even come unless he draws you so I thank the Lord that he placed how many of that seed on the inside amen I thank for most of anything else to know that I'm one of God's children and he put that seat in there gave me that desire he says and then you stumble into a mission you heard the word of God and you heard the truth and you surrendered and you give yourself to it that was God doing all of that so let me know thankful for Amazing Grace Amazing Grace that saved the Wretch like Me thank you thank you Lord for saving me I'm just gonna have to be safe tonight I'm glad to be saved saved from what people don't even know what they're saying from wonderful amen we're saved from sin we're safe from unbelief and what is sin probably God said sin means to miss the mark every time you do something contrived with contrary to God you're sinning or you're missing the mark God says to do something and you don't do it you've sinned you've missed the mark and God came to save you from missing the mark he came down where you could be pleasing to God I'll be glad that you can walk a life every day that's pleasing to God if you can you need more in the blood of Jesus Christ in your life folks I'm thankful that he saved me from sin from missing the mark he saved me from strife and from contention and from hatred and from various from emulation from wrath from bitterness from painting from all of that oh aren't you glad that he saved you oh my you have no idea imagine if somebody come and kidnapped you kidnapped you right nobody knew where you was right he was in the complete control of somebody else they had you bound again they send a letter to your parents said we've got your child you better ping around somewhere else huh what would it be like if a hero come he will come and knock them guys out you heard a bunch of commotion and ragged and whatever it might be and here comes a knight in shining arm delivered you and catch your friends and said here come on you free don't you realize that's what God did for every one of us he paid our Ransom he come and rescued Jill he ransomed me [Music] I'm thankful for that rescue me from the Grinch of the devil the grips of a wrong spirit Oh my he set me free yeah he set me free he broke the bonds up prison for me I'm Glory bound My Savior to see Oh Glory to God he set me free I'll make that thank you Lord for saying to me thank you for setting me free but people still not really free [Music] or sometimes folks the problem is we neglect these little things we're not thankful for him anymore we're not even grateful for a fact that he said it's free or that he saved you I want at least a thousand years maybe two maybe a million or two years Brother Don just to sing I'll sweep the sound Brother Brad it's unfathomable okay to think of the millions of people that's out there huh the druggies that are out there trying to get satisfaction and can't you've got satisfaction you've got peace huh you've got joy unspeakable and full of Glory you know that you're a son and daughter of God and he's chosen you out of those millions of people wow it's amazing how did he do that I didn't deserve it we none deserved it no but he did it he did it before the foundation of the world he thought about you you know what you know mother Glenn I got to think about this message I got to think you know if he had me in his mind before the foundation in the world right he's seen every problem that I would ever face and you know what he did in every problem that I ever faced he would make a way of escape from he made me the way to get out of it it's already made I ain't got to worry about anything that comes my way he's already got it fixed folk because he started to work in me he's gonna finish it right come on folks if I don't do something for your tingling your toes I don't know I will to think he's got it fixed up he's gonna be there kill his child he gonna say to it then you're there he thought of you before I found it so every trial that comes you away he had to let it it's special made for you I don't pay for trials but I don't pray that God will take away the trial according to the prophet of God that God allowed to come your way I pray God help me to make it through I'm here I'm here you're here that means he made a way are you the world but he's made a way and I thank him for it I praise him for he's worthy of Rights thank you Lord thank you Jesus keep one of your thanks [Applause] he's worthy of praise we sit around neglect what God's really done we get rusty on God isn't that the truth these simple things sure but it's the simple things that's the most important like great by faith are you saved through Grace I'm thankful for Faith tonight aren't you you realize that faith that would have that you have by faith we have access into disgrace isn't that right God gave you the faith to be able to believe or you'd be out there in a bar somewhere you'd be a prostitute somewhere you'd be painted out somewhere you'll be dressing more somewhere you'd be empty you'd be unhappy [Music] you might be homeless a bum somewhere no telework be no telling where I'd be amen oh my I thought about that wow if you thought of me he wrote my name down how many please you wrote your name down if he's glorified to you if he's Vindicated to you that you are his son is that right Paul said by his Spirit that's in us that's how we know that we are the sons of God spirit that he's put inside of us if he's done that let me put your name down he procrastinated you already knows everything that's coming your way and guess what he's already got out of every big trouble problem that comes you where he's already got an escape plan for you he's got an Escape Plan how do I know because I've already escaped brother John I've escaped he helped me escape [Applause] what did I escape how many wants to find out what you escaped let me tell you what you escaped what whatever are given to us exceeding Great Divine Nature having us have a big escape the corruption sure because if you had a different nature you'd do different things but we had to have a nature change amen Brother David he was going down that road he testified a lot of times better Joe we all know that we probably you got it that's dead right it didn't live very long didn't serve God didn't live very long none of us probably live very long if we didn't serve God we wouldn't be right in our minds amen so I wrote down here thank you Lord for a sound mind thank you Lord Hallelujah oh my that's right taking this how do bondage think about it your first nature if you're still bind you up oh my you'll be singing the blues of some kind singing the walls you always you booze hey man sadness sorrow no oh but God has given me all these things that's the reason that we're praising him how many knows amen so I wrote down here hey World hey world we have a lot of the same trials the Bible even declares that the sin around this Christian boat we all have trials we have things that happen to us unexpected they have things happen if you aren't careful you're gonna have road rage just like the next person gonna have road rage uh you're gonna have problems things are gonna go wrong but if I could say yeah something I can say but we have got somebody that takes it to it and when we get to the other side we can still be happy we don't have to do more drugs we don't have to shoot somebody or shoot ourselves oh Hallelujah aren't you glad that we've got somebody that takes you through those things thank you Lord for taking me through those hard places amen thank God for on your behalf all right take you through those hard places take this away from the line to turn there's nothing else and that is that whatever comes your way God has a plan and you can find it you can find it folks right here that's where you'll find it folks go on your knees and say Lord what am I supposed to do what am I supposed to do that's something that I didn't know what to do didn't know what to do didn't know what to do didn't know what

bit is that all right let me see here 6 26. amen thank you Lord for telling me to look at the birds he said in Matthew 26 6 and 26 he said behold the fowls behold the fowls Jesus talking here of the air for they so not and neither do they read father feedeth them I mean much and they how many knows I'm thankful that he is a heavenly father that cares about you're taking care of yourself if you think now you wouldn't even draw back there with his grace you'd be in a wheelchair somewhere perhaps you'd be in the hospital of half dead perhaps or whatever might be how many do I have to have to have Mobility tonight to know that you're Heavenly Father cares about you we've got a heavenly father that cares about us he said just look at the birds they don't so in order to read but a Heavenly
