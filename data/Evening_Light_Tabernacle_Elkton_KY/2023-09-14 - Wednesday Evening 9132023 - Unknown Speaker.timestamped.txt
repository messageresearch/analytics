[29:07] praise the Lord
[29:10] amen so if you will uh turn your Bibles
[29:12] to the Book of Revelations
[29:14] Revelations and
[29:18] amen
[29:21] I think we're still okay
[29:24] amen speak a little further Amen on Amen
[29:28] the goodness of God and and how great he
[29:31] is amen I'll tell you what since Sunday
[29:33] I've been just thinking what we preached
[29:35] about it amen and amen and I just tell
[29:38] you what it's so good it's just amazing
[29:41] what God can do when you open up your
[29:42] mind Amen to how great God is amen you
[29:46] realize you realize how little you
[29:48] really know amen
[29:50] yeah
[29:52] it's so amazing God is good uh what was
[29:56] it as I was coming to church I thought
[29:57] about
[29:59] um that song because there's never been
[30:01] a light that shines so bright as this
[30:05] day amen I don't believe we've ever
[30:07] understood the gospel like we have in
[30:10] this hour
[30:12] I don't think we've understood the
[30:13] concept or been in the back God part of
[30:16] God's mind so to speak and understand
[30:18] what the whole plan was all about about
[30:20] like we did in this hour amen because
[30:23] it'll be light in the evening time amen
[30:25] a greater light than any other time amen
[30:28] so praise God and that's what we're
[30:30] doing when we come together just to look
[30:32] at that light and let that light shine
[30:33] down in our hearts and so I believe it
[30:36] will shine again this evening with the
[30:37] help of the Lord all right Revelations
[30:40] will begin
[30:42] amen
[30:44] and I want to speak on omniscience
[30:47] and elections omniscience and election
[30:52] amen so Revelations 1
[30:57] and we'll begin with verse 17.
[31:04] and when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[31:07] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[31:10] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[31:13] and the last
[31:15] I am he that liveth
[31:17] and was dead amen and behold I Am Alive
[31:20] forevermore amen and have the keys of
[31:24] hell
[31:25] and death amen over in verse 8 of the
[31:28] same chapter says I am the alpha the
[31:31] Omega the beginning and the ending saith
[31:33] the Lord which is and which was and
[31:36] which is
[31:38] is to come
[31:39] the Almighty we got it
[31:42] amen so we want to start right here amen
[31:45] and I like that I like
[31:47] this
[31:49] first scripture that we read
[31:53] amen because
[31:56] he identifies
[31:58] Jesus Christ isn't that right now over
[32:02] in Isaiah around the 40th chapter down
[32:04] through chapter 45 somewhere if you'll
[32:07] go look at that you'll find that God
[32:09] calls himself the I am quite a few times
[32:12] I am the I am amen that is my name one
[32:15] place he says that that's my name you
[32:17] know so one of the first names that we
[32:19] find God calling himself is that he's
[32:21] the I am I think of his Moses amen I
[32:23] believe when he went down to Egypt he
[32:25] says you know when he was they asked who
[32:27] represents him he says the I am sent me
[32:30] the I am
[32:31] amen and so
[32:34] uh you know because it I think it shows
[32:37] us that God is a present God Amen I like
[32:40] that don't you because we're always
[32:42] looking at the god of history or the god
[32:43] of the future but he is the
[32:46] I am amen even in the next second or the
[32:49] next hour or tomorrow we want God in
[32:51] that but what's important is that God is
[32:53] right here right now amen
[32:56] amen and so uh praise God
[32:59] he is the I am praised me to God so we
[33:03] look at that and we begin to just think
[33:04] about it and tonight as we talk about
[33:07] this and we want to first of all talking
[33:09] about omniscience or
[33:11] omissions or what we also might call for
[33:14] knowledge right
[33:17] for knowledge this is something of
[33:19] course that we as message Believers have
[33:21] heard a lot now the things that we talk
[33:24] about tonight of course most churches
[33:27] just wouldn't couldn't believe this
[33:30] even brother banham if you remember said
[33:32] now this is a bad word used in the
[33:34] Pentecostal group right for Destination
[33:36] you know other people just you know
[33:39] people have a problem with
[33:40] predestination
[33:42] amen and uh so let me see here first
[33:45] let's start it says put a brand press
[33:47] first of all predestinate that word
[33:49] predestined he said that's
[33:51] not a good word to use he says now the
[33:54] word foreknowledge is better he says and
[33:57] of course we know that's because of the
[33:58] group that he was in he says now
[34:00] predestination looks back to
[34:01] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to
[34:04] destination or destiny amen
[34:08] so try to help me understand this
[34:12] predestination is to destined something
[34:15] to happen it's destined it's destined
[34:18] it's supposed to it makes it happen
[34:19] isn't that right
[34:20] and it looks to foreknowledge because
[34:22] God destineds things to happen because
[34:26] he already knows just
[34:29] how to make it happen
[34:33] he knows
[34:35] what's gonna happen
[34:37] gone a little bit more tonight with the
[34:39] help of the Lord because amen you know
[34:41] we've heard it a lot but I like it amen
[34:44] and there's another scripture as I begin
[34:46] as I begin to study and and seeking the
[34:50] Lord and what he'd have me to speak amen
[34:52] I was over in Isaiah kind of going back
[34:54] over on my message or whatever to see
[34:56] where we're at and this is what I picked
[34:58] up over in Isaiah the 46th chapter if
[35:01] you want to turn with me and this is
[35:03] kind of Amen where we want to pick up
[35:04] here
[35:08] let me see I'm going to go to
[35:10] Revelations right too because I want to
[35:12] compare that
[35:13] amen this uh scripture that we're about
[35:17] to read
[35:18] because if you'll notice here he says I
[35:22] am Alpha and Omega Jesus is not talking
[35:25] to John isn't that something out that as
[35:27] soon as Jesus went back into Spirit form
[35:29] that he began to speak to John he says I
[35:31] am Alpha and Omega now we know that the
[35:36] alpha of course from what I understand
[35:37] is the first letter of the alphabet and
[35:40] Omega is alas isn't that right so he's
[35:43] the complete alphabet and also he's the
[35:46] beginning and in the ending and the
[35:50] ending I mean at the beginning and the
[35:53] ending that's what he is
[35:56] so I think Sunday we covered it a little
[35:58] bit how that he covers all time and
[36:01] space
[36:03] I mean so he's he he is all of that and
[36:07] amen and so and I am he that liveth and
[36:10] was dead and behold I'm nine remember
[36:13] the former things of old for I am God
[36:18] and there is none else I am God and
[36:21] there is none like me
[36:26] amen
[36:29] how many slapped ain't none like him
[36:32] Lord that's just come to my mind isn't
[36:35] there even a song Lord there is none
[36:37] like you that's right nobody's even
[36:41] close to comparing
[36:43] to whom will you
[36:45] compare me amen nobody can even now
[36:47] notice here he says verse 10 declaring
[36:50] declaring the end
[36:53] from the beginning amen declaring the
[36:56] end from the beginning and from the
[36:58] ancient times the things that are not
[37:01] yet done amen saying my counsel shall
[37:06] stand and I will do all my pleasure
[37:11] just comes to mind I didn't write it
[37:13] down but it comes to mind where it says
[37:14] and all things were created up over
[37:17] Revelations I'm not sure which chapter
[37:18] is this all things were created and uh
[37:21] for his pleasure in that one for for his
[37:24] pleasure he created everything it was
[37:26] all for his pleasure
[37:27] here he is actually uh letting us know
[37:30] that he'll he'll he he my counsel shall
[37:33] stand
[37:35] amen
[37:36] calling a ravenous uh bird from the East
[37:40] a man that executed is my counsel from
[37:43] the far country Yates I have spoken it I
[37:46] also will bring it to pass I have
[37:49] purpose it and I will also do it
[37:54] amen
[37:56] how many knows that when you think about
[37:57] the foreknowledge of God when you think
[37:59] about the predestination of God the
[38:01] destination how to be predestines things
[38:04] to happen and so forth I got to thinking
[38:07] of of what it was what it's really like
[38:10] what what it is really like for God Amen
[38:13] to have note everything and I thought
[38:15] now what about what would happen
[38:19] if you or I knew the future
[38:23] huh
[38:25] if you and I knew the future let's say
[38:28] we have the scoreboard of the future
[38:32] let's say you would know what the stock
[38:34] market would do for the next year or
[38:36] whatever
[38:37] yeah
[38:40] you know what I would do if I would if I
[38:42] knew what the stock market would do and
[38:43] all that probably I'd probably saw
[38:45] everything I got
[38:46] I sell everything I got
[38:49] and in a year I'd probably mostly it's
[38:51] been alive
[38:56] somebody that knew the future isn't that
[38:59] right how many notes called inside
[39:00] trading right well if you knew what was
[39:03] going to be really up there gonna we're
[39:04] gonna go way high and everything and
[39:06] that's the whole thing about the stock
[39:07] market it's investing in the right thing
[39:09] you would never make a mistake you never
[39:11] lose
[39:12] [Music]
[39:15] faces or whatever it was in this in a
[39:18] world of sin and so forth why you know
[39:20] exactly what hurts
[39:22] isn't that right
[39:23] [Applause]
[39:25] all right let's talk about uh
[39:28] foreknowledge just a little bit now I
[39:29] want to use an example here and I want
[39:32] to be careful in doing this but maybe
[39:34] Danny if you would help me do this
[39:35] tonight
[39:37] let me express to you one of the ways
[39:39] that I kind of got in my mind of what
[39:41] four knowledge is and and so forth
[39:44] and God knowing everything all right I
[39:47] want you to take take your hand like
[39:49] this and go in
[39:51] um what do you call in slow motion okay
[39:53] and come at me like that just slow
[39:56] motion like that and don't don't follow
[39:58] me just go right from my faith no matter
[40:00] what I for the face now don't hit me
[40:02] we're in church tonight okay
[40:06] but let's go
[40:13] like why that's that's knowing what's
[40:16] going to come he can do whatever he
[40:18] wants in the meantime
[40:20] isn't that right and how many knows
[40:22] guess what God did whenever he knew that
[40:25] head would try to kill all those
[40:27] children isn't that right he knew he'd
[40:28] tell Joseph to take Mary and little
[40:31] and Jesus and Scott on out of there
[40:34] that's why I say Satan doesn't stand a
[40:36] chance against God because God already
[40:38] knows the devil's move
[40:42] here any seats where that hand is coming
[40:44] from and and my when I think about that
[40:47] and I think about you know that God
[40:49] predestined he foresaw you he foresaw
[40:52] every bit of you
[40:54] he knew that every he knows everything
[40:57] that you would ever do
[40:59] he knew I would go just like that before
[41:01] the foundation of the world

[41:58] end from the beginning not only does God
[42:01] know where that punch is going to come
[42:03] from not only does he know everything's
[42:05] going to happen in the future but he
[42:07] goes into the future so to speak

[42:13] is that right goes into that he sets
[42:16] certain things in order how does he time

[45:43] question be the richest man and end up
[45:45] on the planet
[45:47] isn't that right because you knew the
[45:49] future
[45:50] amen now let me ask you something else
[45:54] what about
[45:55] what about the believer
[45:57] what about the
[45:59] Christian
[46:02] that's a good answer right there
[46:04] I mean I was we no the future
[46:10] therefore we can be the richest people
[46:14] on the planet we can be the happiest
[46:17] people on the planet
[46:20] [Applause]
[46:23] hey I take that for that he that
[46:27] believe is on me Jesus said he that
[46:30] believeth on me though he were dead yet
[46:33] shall he live and he that liveth and
[46:35] believes on me shall never die
[46:38] I mean that's the future of those who
[46:41] receive Christ you'll never die that's
[46:44] your future it should never die that's
[46:46] worth more than any manner you could
[46:48] ever make
[46:50] hey man so how many would take man like
[46:52] Birdman said give me 50 years give me 70
[46:55] years 80 years of hardship and toil and
[46:57] misery and pain and I'll give you all of
[47:00] that if that's what it takes if I can
[47:02] just get eternal life I would rather
[47:05] have that than to be here for a million
[47:07] years and to be the king of the world
[47:08] but the man says to be king of all the
[47:11] world the ruler of all the world for a
[47:14] thousand years for 10 000 years
[47:17] I would take the 50 years or whatever a
[47:19] misery and woe
[47:21] let me tell you something we as
[47:23] Christians we're not oh man I'm getting
[47:24] ahead of myself
[47:26] not promise the flower a bit of ease
[47:28] God's election and God's electing You by
[47:31] foreknowledge he wasn't uh in the show
[47:33] oh my it's going to be all easy for you
[47:36] now
[47:37] hey man we'll get in that in a minute
[47:39] but listen so we look at that we think
[47:41] about it you know truly we do we have
[47:44] the scorecard
[47:45] devil Lake of Fire
[47:48] believer
[47:50] eternal life
[47:52] amen we have this cocoa this is the
[47:54] future we can see a future
[47:57] amen isn't it something how how the God
[47:59] would use the prophet of God
[48:01] and he would look and
[48:04] look back and I I believe he must have
[48:07] seen Marilyn Monroe having a heart
[48:09] attack didn't he he said it wasn't the
[48:11] drugs it was her heart attack
[48:14] God could tell her Allen Luke Plumb Back
[48:17] to Eden he feels all time in space I
[48:21] mean it was everything that you every
[48:23] emotion you ever do every color of every
[48:25] shirt every suit you have to wear
[48:26] everything you ever did that's all
[48:28] recorded calls it recorded
[48:31] the man and God just replayed it or
[48:33] whatever took him back to that time
[48:34] space and showed him what he looked like
[48:36] and all these other things
[48:38] people that were sitting there maybe all
[48:40] Jason this after the other take them
[48:42] back in time right there it is it ain't
[48:44] going nowhere
[48:47] [Music]
[48:52] God knows everything
[48:55] he predestinates he ordains
[48:58] amen
[49:00] praise the Lord
[49:02] because he knows what you would do
[49:06] he knows what you would do what you will
[49:08] do
[49:10] I thought man you can just relax a
[49:13] Believer it's so real it's so such a
[49:16] security
[49:18] to be a believer now if you're not a
[49:20] Believer it's a scary thought
[49:22] and a lot of people if they're not saved
[49:25] the eyes are scary it's up to think that
[49:27] if you ever was saved you would say
[49:29] before the foundation of the world
[49:31] how many believe that
[49:35] I'm going to say it again I've said it
[49:37] before the pope but here one of the most
[49:38] things that you can't comprehend is that
[49:41] God doesn't have to plan something he
[49:43] does plan something but if we when we
[49:46] think about a plan it's around all right
[49:48] let's change the plan let you know when
[49:51] God has a thought it's a perfect thought
[49:53] the first time
[49:55] how many knows God's thoughts are
[49:58] eternal
[49:59] and you have to be one of those thoughts
[50:01] that he had before the foundation of the
[50:03] world if you're ever going to be there
[50:06] this brings into now another thought
[50:09] that is identification
[50:11] amen
[50:12] because I mean it's important that you
[50:14] know who you are what you are
[50:16] amen and as you look into here
[50:19] right into the mirror of God's word
[50:23] it's going to reflect
[50:26] it's going to reflect what you are
[50:28] in there right who your daddy is
[50:31] who's your father
[50:33] the choices that you make identify who
[50:35] you are and if you are identified with
[50:37] them
[50:38] when you've been buried with him by
[50:41] baptism
[50:43] hey amen amen come forth in newness of
[50:46] life amen you've got filled with the
[50:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost you're
[50:50] identified with Acts 2 you're identified
[50:52] in God's word you want to be the
[50:55] happiest person the greatest thing that
[50:56] you'll ever have is to know that you're
[50:58] a son of God
[51:01] for anything you'll ever have is to know
[51:03] who you really are what your identity
[51:05] really is
[51:08] amen
[51:10] you have to be a part of this plan
[51:14] how many believe that to be a part of
[51:16] his plan
[51:18] a part of those thoughts those things
[51:20] that he knew
[51:22] and purpose before the foundation of the
[51:24] world
[51:27] I wanted to give it just a little bit of
[51:29] a thought on on the opposite side of it
[51:32] now Jesus says
[51:34] all that come to
[51:36] me what if he say you know well I'll
[51:39] tell you what you're going to be saved
[51:40] if you don't do this you don't
[51:43] anybody be saved
[51:45] no
[51:46] no you wouldn't make it because you're a
[51:48] human being
[51:49] full of mistakes
[51:51] promised by the prophet of God you'll
[51:53] always have mistakes as long as you
[51:58] draw breath
[52:03] yeah
[52:06] Lord forgive me for that viewers relying
[52:08] on yourself
[52:09] but if you're not relying on ourselves
[52:12] we're relying on what he did what he
[52:15] wrote
[52:17] it's so much so that he told Peter them
[52:20] he says man the devil said oh my you're
[52:22] casting them out the lady we're walking
[52:25] and all open up the eyes and all of
[52:28] these people that joins me because your
[52:31] names are written in hell
[52:40] you're a part of the program of God the
[52:47] judge
[52:48] aren't you glad for that
[52:51] see we love Romans don't we
[52:53] I love Romans 8.
[52:59] I love Romans 8 and
[53:02] verse 29 for whom he did for no
[53:05] he also did predestinate Amen to be
[53:07] conformed to the image of his son
[53:09] that he might be the first born among
[53:11] many Brethren moral
[53:13] over whom he did predestinate then he
[53:15] also called whom he called them and he
[53:17] also Justified then we Justified them we
[53:19] also glorified
[53:21] let me see
[53:25] over in chapter 9 chapter 9 of Romans
[53:30] talking about
[53:32] for knowledge and for the nation
[53:37] in verse 22 what if God willing to show
[53:39] his wrath and to make
[53:41] his power known and do it with much
[53:44] long-suffering the vessels of Wrath
[53:46] fitted for Destruction
[53:48] then he might that he might make known
[53:50] The Riches of his glory on the vessels
[53:53] of Mercy how many beliefs that's what
[53:56] we're talking about tonight
[53:57] we're talking about the riches of his
[53:59] glory on the vessels of Mercy I'm gonna
[54:02] believe you're a vessel of Mercy
[54:06] which he had
[54:09] a far prepared unto Glory
[54:13] even us
[54:15] whom he hath called not of the Jews only
[54:18] but also of the Gentiles
[54:21] how many notes he before
[54:24] ordained you
[54:26] to this Glory
[54:28] amen
[54:32] even us whom he has called there you
[54:34] find yourself and listen who he has
[54:36] called them he also Justified whom he
[54:38] has Justified then he also glorified
[54:41] Converse in Ephesians before we kind of
[54:43] go in a different direction tonight
[54:45] but Ephesians
[54:47] 1
[54:48] and verse let's go with verse 4.
[54:55] according
[54:57] as he has chosen Us in him before the
[55:00] foundation of the world that we should
[55:02] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[55:06] love having predestinated us unto the
[55:08] adoption of children of Jesus Christ
[55:09] himself according to the good pleasure
[55:11] of his will how many knows if God knows
[55:15] he's in
[55:17] infinite
[55:23] I noticed
[55:25] he could set things in order to happen
[55:28] now notice by God's wise Providence
[55:33] he
[55:34] had
[55:36] reveal
[55:37] by spiritual going to be a chosen vessel
[55:40] and his mother wasn't scared of the
[55:42] King's Command by faith she's
[55:46] saw him
[55:48] with the children
[55:50] bring them over into the Promised line
[55:52] the Promised Land
[56:04] as a matter of fact
[56:07] I think I got it here yeah here it is
[56:11] everything was all pre-planned by God
[56:13] before the foundation of the world
[56:15] that you're here the infinite God knowed
[56:18] to be infinite he had to know every flea
[56:22] that ever would be on the earth and how
[56:24] much many times
[56:26] that it with that it's I that's infinite
[56:29] now our little Minds cannot fathom what
[56:33] infinite means
[56:34] amen the infinite God he knowed all
[56:37] things therefore there's nothing out of
[56:39] cater
[56:42] if we know the word of God
[56:45] we know where we are living
[56:47] we know the hour that we're living in
[56:50] and a while ago
[56:52] I think George somebody said we know
[56:54] what the future holds listen to what
[56:56] brother Adam says we know what lays
[56:59] ahead
[57:01] we know what lays ahead
[57:04] now there's a lot of things happening in
[57:05] our lives
[57:06] I wasn't expecting a Saturday either but
[57:09] overall we know why do we know that lays
[57:11] ahead we know the one that holds your
[57:13] future we know that he had promised that
[57:15] he's going to take
[57:17] you through
[57:19] isn't that right no matter what comes
[57:22] your way no matter what problems you
[57:23] face all about it
[57:26] amen
[57:28] amen and God is going to take care of
[57:31] you he's promising we know what lays
[57:34] ahead and God will it always makes a way
[57:40] because we're in his hands were
[57:42] completely surrendered to him praise be
[57:45] glad for that he knows all about it and
[57:48] just as he can go and he can block a
[57:51] punch he can do whatever he can set it
[57:53] all in order all we got to do is be
[57:55] yielded to him and say God whatever your
[57:57] plan is Lord that's what I want amen
[58:01] praise the Lord
[58:04] Hallelujah
[58:08] now
[58:10] action
[58:12] election always election always also
[58:17] also looks back to foreknowledge
[58:20] foreknew you and God elected you
[58:24] now do you know what I really like
[58:28] about election
[58:30] you know because
[58:33] some of some of the
[58:35] SE
[58:37] politicians that you know you just like
[58:40] to fire him just fire the guy
[58:45] when you're elected
[58:48] you can't be fired
[58:51] I they took a great big they're doing
[58:54] that take a re-vote they have to take
[58:55] some
[58:59] look a vote put him in a vote left take
[59:02] him out
[59:03] that you can't just fire the guy
[59:08] not how many knows that if you're a
[59:10] child of God God
[59:14] you you can't just put you out
[59:19] there's only one not one that I know of
[59:21] can put you out
[59:24] he says anybody adds to this book his
[59:27] name can be removed
[59:29] you know
[59:31] but God the one that does it amen one
[59:34] whose names are going to be removed
[59:39] you know it would scare me to hear a red
[59:41] preacher come up here and preach
[59:42] something contrary to the word and
[59:44] change this take that away because you
[59:46] know what I would think that guy's gonna
[59:48] have his name removed if you don't
[59:49] repent
[59:51] he's a he's a good candidate to have his
[59:53] name removed
[59:55] I don't have my name removed I bet I
[59:57] want to stay right there with the word
[1:00:01] but that's what I I don't know about you
[1:00:02] but that's what I like about election
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:06] got elected you to be Son of God now
[1:00:08] notice he elected you he predestinated
[1:00:11] you and he showed his love to you
[1:00:16] by what
[1:00:18] election how many believes that his
[1:00:20] elect his love is elective love
[1:00:24] listen to what the brother Brian says
[1:00:27] the proof of his love is election no
[1:00:30] matter what happens his love is proven
[1:00:33] by the fact that they were chosen unto
[1:00:36] salvation
[1:00:37] amen God has chosen you unto salvation
[1:00:41] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:00:42] believed for the truth he may commit you
[1:00:44] to death like he did Paul he may commit
[1:00:46] you to suffering like he did job that's
[1:00:48] his prerogative but that he's Sovereign
[1:00:50] but it's all for his purpose but the
[1:00:52] thing of it is
[1:00:54] I like this because we love election but
[1:00:57] remember this if God elected you he
[1:01:00] elected you to be his son and daughter
[1:01:02] of God
[1:01:04] and when I was thinking about this he's
[1:01:06] elected you to hardship he elected you
[1:01:08] to trials
[1:01:10] remember one place here Jesus said you
[1:01:12] know and he said man I I send you out
[1:01:14] there sheep amongst the wolves
[1:01:16] it has not been easier the the believer
[1:01:20] those who are elected and foreknowledge
[1:01:22] and the foreknowledge of God he said we
[1:01:24] were predestinated to be conformed to
[1:01:26] the image of fun I mean it was that
[1:01:28] character doesn't come by just uh magic
[1:01:32] wand
[1:01:34] those things come through suffering and
[1:01:36] through hardships and battles and
[1:01:37] everything else
[1:01:39] he says blessed are they which are uh uh
[1:01:41] uh hunger now for they shall be
[1:01:44] fulfilled isn't that right all these
[1:01:46] different things he said about it when
[1:01:48] they persecute you and and so far from
[1:01:50] City to city and this out of the other
[1:01:51] all down through time my the Christian
[1:01:54] those elected ones they've had it hard
[1:01:57] God never promises elect the people that
[1:02:00] he foreknew a lifeline and then that's
[1:02:03] why
[1:02:04] I said Lord Jesus look at us
[1:02:07] here we are in laodicea and and even if
[1:02:09] you look back at the early 1900s you
[1:02:12] know and the first depression first
[1:02:14] world war one the people that didn't

[1:03:26] listen the talking about Israel he says
[1:03:28] they couldn't figure out God's love they
[1:03:29] thought that love meant no suffering
[1:03:32] they thought that lovement and baby in
[1:03:35] Parental care but God said and his love
[1:03:37] was elective love and love real genuine
[1:03:40] love is also corrective lovers many as I
[1:03:43] love I rebuke I chase and I chastise

[1:04:29] daughter God they don't look for it easy
[1:04:32] we don't expect it easy when God said
[1:04:34] something our way we ought to be Sons
[1:04:37] and Daughters of God and make him proud
[1:04:39] how many knows in any family even in
[1:04:42] this election thing but if I'm talking
[1:04:43] about he says we know that in the
[1:04:45] foreknowledge of God God wanted a family
[1:04:46] of his own he wanted Sons like himself

[1:05:32] that's how he shows his love how did we
[1:05:34] show our love back I think how do we
[1:05:36] show our love back to him
[1:05:39] by conducting ourselves as sons and
[1:05:42] acting like children of the most high
[1:05:45] this great God that knew all things and
