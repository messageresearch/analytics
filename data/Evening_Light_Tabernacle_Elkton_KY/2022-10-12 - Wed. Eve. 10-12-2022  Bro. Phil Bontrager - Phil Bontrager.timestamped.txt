[47:32] from acts about three or four verses in
[47:34] Acts 19.
[47:36] starting at verse 13.
[47:39] Acts 19 will start at verse 13.
[47:50] it says this then certain of the
[47:52] Vagabond Jews Exorcist
[47:54] took upon them to call over them which
[47:57] had evil spirits the name of the Lord
[47:58] Jesus saying we endure You by Jesus whom
[48:02] Paul preacheth
[48:03] and there are seven sons of one skiba a
[48:05] Jew and chief of the priest with did so
[48:08] and the evil spirit answered and said
[48:10] Jesus I know and Paul I know
[48:14] but who are ye
[48:16] and the man in whom the evil spirit was
[48:18] leaked on them and overcame them and
[48:19] prevailed against them so they fled out
[48:21] of that house naked and wounded go ahead
[48:24] and have a seat tonight I want to I'm
[48:26] going to speak on the thought the
[48:27] devil's question
[48:30] I'm gonna ask you
[48:32] who are you
[48:34] yeah who are you
[48:37] because see right now this world is
[48:39] having a serious identity crisis
[48:43] nobody knows who they are
[48:46] men can't decide if they're a man a
[48:48] woman woman can't people can't even tell
[48:50] you what a woman is they they can't tell
[48:52] what gender they are they say well I'm
[48:54] I'm gender fluid I'm a man one day I'm a
[48:56] girl the next day sometimes I'm a cat
[48:58] sometimes I'm something besides all that
[49:00] and the whole world is going crazy and
[49:02] what's the really bad part is the people
[49:04] who should know better the Educators
[49:07] smart people the doctors the leaders of
[49:09] the country all these people they
[49:11] actually go along they say yeah this is
[49:13] legitimate friends is not legitimate
[49:15] this is insanity your Prophet said is
[49:17] going to happen in this world he said
[49:19] the world will go completely insane and
[49:21] we see it right now on the street and
[49:23] the people who are supposed to be
[49:24] leading us are the ones who are leading
[49:26] that insanity
[49:29] that's right what's it all about friends
[49:31] it's Satan asking the question he's
[49:33] trying to figure out excuse me I'm
[49:34] choking to death already
[49:36] he's trying to ask who are you he wants
[49:38] to find out why because Satan always has
[49:40] problems identifying Christ in flesh Oh
[49:43] my he always has struggle because he
[49:46] looks at you he said are you kidding
[49:49] this is the bride of Christ
[49:51] come on ordinary people like this
[49:54] the bride of Christ
[49:58] he struggles with that he does
[50:01] because he can't stand to think that you
[50:05] in that flesh body you're in can
[50:07] overcome him
[50:09] he cannot stand to think that you can
[50:11] cast him out he cannot stand to think
[50:13] that you can lay your hands on the sick
[50:15] and they will recover and that demons
[50:17] are holding him have got to leave he
[50:19] can't stand you because of this
[50:22] because he's got every other age he's
[50:24] got every the bride all the way he got
[50:26] eat he got the Israel the the Jewish
[50:29] bride he got every Church ate down
[50:30] through the church ages he got him all
[50:33] to fall to some temptation but he can't
[50:35] touch you what is wrong with you who Do
[50:38] You Think You Are
[50:40] because you've been given something that
[50:43] those other ages lost and that was the
[50:45] pure work to produce a pure bride that
[50:47] will not that will not uh hybrid herself
[50:50] with some man-made doctor and some
[50:51] man-made's Creed and you see here with
[50:53] the pure word is producing the act the
[50:55] absolute genuine Jesus Christ in flesh
[50:57] again today
[50:59] in case you wanted to know that's who
[51:00] you are
[51:03] now do you believe that as a Doctrine
[51:06] would you have the authority of the word
[51:08] to stand there on the word because it's
[51:09] been revealed to you because see that's
[51:11] where a lot of people are and they're a
[51:13] good message believe or they believe
[51:14] they're proper and they believe there
[51:16] they live a good life
[51:18] but it's just a Doctrine
[51:21] and if it's just a Doctrine the best you
[51:23] can produce as lukewarm Lego seed and
[51:26] message believer
[51:28] that's a horrible place to be in this
[51:30] day friends because God hates that
[51:32] spirit
[51:34] Satan try to identify God in flesh he's
[51:38] always been doing it look let's look at
[51:39] this John the Baptist he come out right
[51:41] and the priests and Levites come out to
[51:43] him and say who are you
[51:45] tell us who you are he said he confess
[51:47] it I'm not the Christ
[51:49] he's coming after me but look what look
[51:51] what Santa is doing he always has it's
[51:53] the religious leaders and just be is
[51:56] Satan almost always taking those
[51:57] religious denominational leaders and
[51:59] leading them he's trying to find John
[52:01] are you that Christ are you the one says
[52:03] no I'm not the one because Satan saw
[52:04] that he had a strange kind of birth he
[52:06] knew there was something strange about
[52:07] him so he was concerned oh you hear me
[52:09] so I'm not him
[52:12] Jesus come along he started doing some
[52:14] amazing things what happened Nicodemus
[52:17] come out here he snuck out at night
[52:18] right because he's part of that
[52:20] denominational system who didn't really
[52:22] like what's going on they didn't want
[52:23] some other religion popping up to oppose
[52:26] them because that took away their power
[52:28] and their Prestige and their money and
[52:30] their popularity and so Nicodemus came
[52:32] out and said now now we know first of
[52:34] all he said we know that means they've
[52:36] been discussing it right they're sitting
[52:38] around thinking who is this guy why is
[52:40] he not there doing these so he said we
[52:42] the the the denomination we know that
[52:45] you're a man sent from God you're a
[52:46] teacher from God because no one could do
[52:47] these things what was Nicodemus next
[52:50] question
[52:51] now we know yourself from God his next
[52:53] question would have been now who are you
[52:57] identify yourself
[53:00] Jesus cut them off
[53:02] never let him ask that question you know
[53:04] why Jesus said it don't make any sense
[53:08] we know your man sent from God except
[53:10] you're born again you can't believe it
[53:11] anyways you can't understand it anyways
[53:13] you cannot see the kingdom of God I am
[53:15] the Kingdom of Heaven stand in front of
[53:16] you and he said unless you're born again
[53:18] you can never see or understand so
[53:20] you're wasting your time until you get
[53:22] the new birth and let me tell you
[53:24] something brother sister tonight if you
[53:26] are sitting in this church and you don't
[53:28] have the new birth you're still wasting
[53:30] your time
[53:31] because you're not going anywhere you
[53:34] want without it
[53:36] I don't care how faithful you are in
[53:38] this church you can see her pay attizing
[53:40] preach to everything you want to do but
[53:42] unless you're born again you will never
[53:44] understand the kingdom of God because
[53:46] the kingdom of God is inside you and if
[53:48] it's not inside you you don't know what
[53:50] you're talking about I don't care how
[53:52] much you can quote the prophet
[53:54] it's just the way it is friends it's
[53:57] never changed since Nicodemus went to
[53:59] Jesus till tonight except you're born
[54:01] again you cannot understand the kingdom
[54:03] of God
[54:04] and you can look around and see all
[54:06] these wonderful people and you can think
[54:07] you're one of them
[54:10] but if you don't stand on the revelation
[54:12] of the authority of the word in your own
[54:14] self personally you're just being
[54:16] deceived
[54:22] [Applause]
[54:24] John 10 says the Jews came around him
[54:26] and said him down how long does that
[54:28] make us doubt if thou be the Christ tell
[54:31] us plainly
[54:33] oh he's asking who are you
[54:36] Jesus answers I already told you
[54:41] and you believe not
[54:43] because it wasn't the way they wanted
[54:45] him to be he wasn't the Christ the
[54:46] Messiah that they look for that's why he
[54:49] fooled Satan because it wasn't the way
[54:51] you know sales saw that word he saw the
[54:53] prophecy for what the messiah's supposed
[54:54] to be and here comes this man he born a
[54:56] really strange birth he grows up he just
[54:58] disappears
[55:01] and Satan's watching him all this time
[55:03] he goes to his teen years nothing really
[55:04] happens
[55:05] go says 20s
[55:07] don't look at nothing here I guess it
[55:09] was just another flash in the pan
[55:11] all of a Suddenly It's just about his
[55:13] authorities and all of a sudden he
[55:14] starts doing things they say oh
[55:17] I gotta find out who this is
[55:22] so he's there he's watching there's John
[55:24] the Baptist that crazy man down there
[55:25] dunking people in the water and Jesus
[55:27] goes to him and say and said oh let's
[55:29] see what's going on he says he saw the
[55:30] the spirit of God like a dove come down
[55:32] on him oh
[55:34] oh now he's going to start his ministry
[55:36] now he's going to start assembling an
[55:37] army and throw the Romans out of out of
[55:39] Judea and now he's going to start with
[55:41] causing Revolt he's going to start
[55:42] Gathering people together and Satan said
[55:44] okay gotta stop this now because Satan
[55:46] believed that because all those other
[55:47] people believed it he had inspired them
[55:50] to believe that the scriptures that way
[55:54] yeah and you know what this said the
[55:56] Bible says the spirit the Holy Spirit
[55:57] drove him into the the desert
[56:04] why would the Holy Spirit do that
[56:08] same reason he does it with you
[56:12] he takes you to the desert doesn't he
[56:15] I hope so if he doesn't you got
[56:17] something to worry about because every
[56:19] son and daughter of God has to go
[56:21] through their desert experience and
[56:22] ain't a one-time thing we go through
[56:24] these over and over because this is
[56:25] where you mold your character
[56:28] all right
[56:29] so Satan's watching and he's out there
[56:31] wandering through the desert he's
[56:32] getting weaker because he ain't eating
[56:33] you remember he's a man and he's not
[56:35] eating for 40 days and you know what
[56:37] happens when you don't eat for 40 days
[56:38] you get weak you get weak spiritually
[56:40] you get weak physically you will get
[56:42] weak mentally you get weak emotionally
[56:44] and all it has effect we're going to get
[56:46] weak when you're not eating you become
[56:47] weak and it affects your whole life
[56:50] until about 40 days Satan says you know
[56:52] what this guy's pretty much pretty weak
[56:53] is he gonna get he's probably gonna
[56:55] start eating let me go out and just tell
[56:56] him because I got every Prophet
[56:58] everything every person every man every
[57:01] woman I got Eve I have a very Paradise
[57:03] itself to fought to my Temptation and
[57:05] I'm gonna prove to you that this ain't
[57:07] him either
[57:09] care what John said about the Lamb of
[57:11] God I'm gonna get him because I have I
[57:13] know how to tempt a person
[57:16] you ever tempt you
[57:19] I hope so
[57:21] he better be
[57:23] so he goes up to him he says
[57:26] if thou be there is there is your
[57:28] question
[57:30] if thou be
[57:32] the Son of God you're hungry why don't
[57:35] you turn some of this rocks into bread
[57:37] and eat I mean goodness sakes he got
[57:39] Moses to fall to that Temptation he got
[57:41] Elijah he got all these people use your
[57:43] gift
[57:44] you've got great gifts use this to prove
[57:46] your because he knew Satan knew that he
[57:48] knew that if he was the Messiah he was
[57:50] the very Creator he could do anything he
[57:52] wanted
[57:52] Satan knew that
[57:56] kind of just jump off a little bit a bit
[57:57] yeah
[57:59] I'm convinced friends that so many
[58:01] message Believers still think he's the
[58:02] second person in a trinity
[58:06] and I think that so many massive
[58:08] Believers think that the holy spirit is
[58:10] some inferior Spirit to God the Father
[58:15] because we treat him so different oh
[58:17] yeah the holy spirit is here holy spirit
[58:19] is here really and we treat him the way
[58:20] we do
[58:22] foreign
[58:27] so Jesus met that Temptation with the
[58:30] word
[58:31] singed from tail feathers he didn't know
[58:33] saying that's tail feathers the prophet
[58:35] said he sent his tail feathers
[58:37] I don't know what he looks like with
[58:38] tail feathers but
[58:41] so Satan wised up a little bit he said
[58:43] whoa
[58:45] he thought he would
[58:47] and so he gave him another temptation
[58:49] he said you know dump up you know go
[58:52] take up on the the temple there and jump
[58:54] off and he quoted the scripture to him
[58:57] and Jesus came right back with another
[58:58] scripture
[59:00] and Jesus scripture overcomes saying
[59:02] scripture
[59:04] he said there are both scripture yeah
[59:05] but why does saying scripture fall to
[59:08] see Jesus because Satan did not have the
[59:10] authority of the word it was not in
[59:12] Revelation it was just a Doctrine
[59:15] all saying could do was called the
[59:16] scripture as a Doctrine
[59:20] and Jesus no standing and he took the
[59:22] authority of the word and he overcomes
[59:25] Satan and brother Brown says that's the
[59:27] only way why he was doing the show and
[59:28] you and I had to overcome the only way
[59:31] you know you're overcoming is if you're
[59:33] using the word
[59:35] and it's not because you can quote Dr
[59:37] the scripture I tried that so many times
[59:39] and Satan's coming their Temptation and
[59:41] I take a scripture and I quote and I
[59:43] quote and I quoted and I still fall to
[59:45] the Temptation why because it wasn't
[59:47] something that God had revealed to me
[59:49] I'm just trying to take a Doctrine
[59:53] you have to know friends that's been
[59:55] revealed that you have the authority
[59:56] when you recognize who you are in the
[59:58] word brother Brad said Jesus saw himself
[1:00:00] in the scripture he went out and
[1:00:01] fulfilled what the Messiah was supposed
[1:00:03] to fulfill and he says that's what the
[1:00:05] bride does too you see yourself in the
[1:00:07] word for this day and you go on you
[1:00:09] fulfill what the brightest post to
[1:00:11] fulfill
[1:00:13] you don't do that by just quoting a
[1:00:15] Doctrine or a quote or whatever like
[1:00:16] that it's got to be something well how
[1:00:17] do you get this Revelation well first of
[1:00:19] all brother bear said you should pray
[1:00:20] for Revelation more than anything else
[1:00:27] how do you get this real he's so you
[1:00:30] can't give yourself Revelation he has to
[1:00:31] reveal it to you
[1:00:33] and that's sovereign
[1:00:34] he gives it to who he will
[1:00:36] well I'm living a good life that doesn't
[1:00:39] matter
[1:00:40] I mean that doesn't mean it doesn't
[1:00:41] matter it does
[1:00:43] that doesn't mean you're gonna it's
[1:00:44] gonna be revealed to you well how do you
[1:00:45] get it you wrestle
[1:00:49] between
[1:00:51] you
[1:00:52] guys are having it or your mom your dad
[1:00:54] having it you must have that Revelation
[1:00:56] yourself you must wrestle it out you had
[1:00:58] to have that root that that relationship
[1:01:01] with Christ and I'm not talking about
[1:01:02] just a church relationship when it comes
[1:01:05] Sunday morning and you're worship and
[1:01:06] you praise and you listen to the
[1:01:08] preacher and you say amen and you go out
[1:01:09] and say boy we had a good service can't
[1:01:11] wait till Wednesday night
[1:01:15] you're not going into reaction with the
[1:01:17] church relationship it's got to be a
[1:01:20] daily relationship you got to know and
[1:01:22] it's got to be something once you know
[1:01:24] him and you can't help but love him and
[1:01:27] when you love him you want to be with
[1:01:28] them and you don't want to make it some
[1:01:29] kind of Justice well I pray and read my
[1:01:32] Bible 15 minutes every night before I go
[1:01:34] to bed
[1:01:38] I'm gonna get in trouble here I'm gonna
[1:01:40] talk about stuff I got nothing about
[1:01:41] okay married couples okay I'm single in
[1:01:44] case you didn't know that never been
[1:01:45] married but let me ask you brother
[1:01:47] something
[1:01:48] who are married
[1:01:52] let's say you're at work
[1:01:55] and you think about your wife and you
[1:01:57] have a break so you call her up
[1:01:59] honey I just want to talk to you I just
[1:02:00] want to say hello and she said you know
[1:02:01] I'm really busy can we talk tonight at
[1:02:03] that 15 minute planned talk we have
[1:02:08] oh I just want to I know I know listen
[1:02:10] something just came up on Facebook I'm
[1:02:12] busy I gotta answer this all right we'll
[1:02:14] talk later
[1:02:19] how many guilty of something I'm not
[1:02:22] preaching against Facebook
[1:02:23] do whatever you want I don't care
[1:02:25] I'm not preaching against Facebook
[1:02:27] anymore I'm preaching against hunting
[1:02:28] anymore I'm preaching again hunt uh
[1:02:29] shopping or eating or anything else the
[1:02:31] only thing I'm saying is when you go do
[1:02:33] what you're going to do take Jesus with
[1:02:35] you
[1:02:36] take Jesus be sitting right beside you
[1:02:38] there when you're on Facebook when
[1:02:40] you're shopping when you're hunting
[1:02:42] whatever it is take him with you that's
[1:02:43] all he's asking for and I go with you
[1:02:45] can I be part of your life
[1:02:48] I give you 15 minutes every night what
[1:02:50] do you want
[1:02:53] I go to church twice a week I pay my
[1:02:56] times I live a good life what more are
[1:02:58] you looking for he's looking for love
[1:03:01] he hates religion he wants love
[1:03:04] that's all he's ever wanted is someone
[1:03:06] who wants to love him more than they
[1:03:08] love their Church well then they'll love
[1:03:09] their religion those Pharisees love the
[1:03:11] religion more they love Christ so they
[1:03:13] had to reject him and that's the same
[1:03:14] thing today that's why the denomination
[1:03:18] affected him many years ago because you
[1:03:19] have to humble yourself
[1:03:21] to be to be one of Christ and you had to
[1:03:24] suck you had to rest without yourself
[1:03:25] with Christ you as an individual it
[1:03:27] doesn't matter what church you go to it
[1:03:29] doesn't matter what you believe you have
[1:03:31] to wrestle it out you and God alone it's
[1:03:33] an individual walk it's not you and your
[1:03:36] church it's not you and your family it's
[1:03:38] not you and your pastor it's just you
[1:03:40] and Jesus Christ
[1:03:43] nothing else counts
[1:03:48] look at your life I challenge you look
[1:03:50] at your life who are you
[1:03:53] who are you do you have that
[1:03:56] relationship with Christ are you just a
[1:03:58] lukewarm messageably or sitting in a
[1:03:59] nice view in a nice church with a nice
[1:04:01] passion with a nice everything going on
[1:04:03] and you're being so blessed look around
[1:04:05] you because all that's fiction to fall
[1:04:07] apart
[1:04:11] I can tell you this I believe this with
[1:04:12] all my heart there's going to be a time
[1:04:14] and then very near future when all of a
[1:04:16] sudden these computers are gonna start
[1:04:17] filling up
[1:04:20] with all those people who have the last
[1:04:22] oh I want to get I'm not right with God
[1:04:24] I'm not right with God I got to get to
[1:04:25] church you know they're sitting out
[1:04:26] there just enjoying this nice
[1:04:28] bubble that's gonna burst
[1:04:33] let me ask you a question
[1:04:35] I'm so off my subject but anyways
[1:04:38] what if you knew you don't but what if
[1:04:42] you knew
[1:04:43] that the Rapture was going to happen
[1:04:45] next Sunday
[1:04:50] how would it change your life
[1:04:52] yeah
[1:04:55] would you also get serious
[1:04:58] oh so you're not serious now
[1:05:02] would you all sing it A Prayer life
[1:05:09] think about it
[1:05:17] he was on the cross and found me the Son
[1:05:19] of God come down off the cross
[1:05:22] mocking him
[1:05:23] trying to see if it was trying to prove
[1:05:26] to themselves it wasn't him because they
[1:05:28] did not want to accept that's that's who
[1:05:30] it was
[1:05:32] they didn't want to accept it
[1:05:39] Matthew 8
[1:05:41] 28 I want to read something here if you
[1:05:43] want to turn to it that's fine but you
[1:05:44] don't have to
[1:05:47] so this was a little bit later after the
[1:05:49] Temptation This is when Jesus had gone
[1:05:50] about doing some mighty works and you
[1:05:52] know what the demons find out babe this
[1:05:54] is the real deal right here
[1:05:56] 8 28 and when he was coming to the other
[1:05:59] side into the country of the good scenes
[1:06:01] there Mayhem two possessed with Devils
[1:06:02] coming out of the tombs exceeding Fierce
[1:06:04] so that no man might pass that way
[1:06:09] and behold
[1:06:10] they cried out saying what have we to do
[1:06:14] with thee Jesus thou Son of God
[1:06:17] what a difference
[1:06:20] they are still asking questions
[1:06:23] but it was no more a question of who he
[1:06:25] was those demons identified who he was
[1:06:29] they knew who he was the religious
[1:06:32] people were calling him a devil the
[1:06:34] Devils were calling him God
[1:06:40] asking him what do we have to do with
[1:06:42] you why don't you leave us alone
[1:06:44] why don't why do you have to mess with
[1:06:46] it just we're happy here just don't come
[1:06:48] in here and stir things up
[1:06:50] just leave us alone I'm happy being a
[1:06:53] lukewarm message believer I'm happy
[1:06:55] sitting here in this seat why should you
[1:06:57] come and mess with me why do you get
[1:06:59] you may have to get me uncomfortable in
[1:07:01] my chair
[1:07:03] I have a good standing in the church
[1:07:06] thorn in your pastor's flesh
[1:07:16] let me I'm kind of just blunt for a
[1:07:19] second if you're a lukewarm message
[1:07:20] believer you are a thorn in your past
[1:07:22] with flesh because you bring that nasty
[1:07:23] spirit in here every time you come to
[1:07:25] church
[1:07:28] it's true
[1:07:31] if you want me to quit I'll quit
[1:07:35] these demons coming to identifying who
[1:07:38] he was and say why are you messing with
[1:07:40] us
[1:07:42] leave us alone
[1:07:45] they were done they asked another
[1:07:46] question all right now come hither to

[1:10:11] studying and I got busy on some other
[1:10:14] ridiculously nonsense total wasted time
[1:10:16] and all of a sudden it's time to go to

[1:11:17] he's looking for someone to take him at
[1:11:19] his work so he can come and move to the
[1:11:22] profession of his word that's all he's
[1:11:24] looking for
[1:11:26] yeah
[1:11:27] let's keep looking at these folks here
[1:11:29] they said are you kind of headed to
[1:11:32] torment us before the time
[1:11:34] now I don't know exactly what that means
[1:11:37] torments before the time I'll imagine it
[1:11:39] has to sending them back to hell because
[1:11:41] friends the demons themselves hate hell
[1:11:44] they don't want to go to hell they want
[1:11:45] to be out here on Earth where they can
[1:11:47] torment people and live in people and
[1:11:48] even live in pigs they're ready to live
[1:11:50] in pigs go to hell
[1:11:52] can you imagine if we have to go there
[1:11:54] friends don't go to hell you don't have
[1:11:56] to
[1:11:58] you don't have to what the world has to
[1:12:00] offer I promise you is not worth it

[1:12:06] tell you all this is going to be good
[1:12:08] you don't want it's so hard to be a
[1:12:09] Christian

[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:15] how hard is it to be a sinner
[1:12:18] they're the most miserable I've ever
[1:12:20] seen I work in mental health with
[1:12:22] troubled kids you want to see troubled
[1:12:24] unhappy kids they're out there serving
[1:12:26] the devil as hard as they can they're
[1:12:28] the most miserable suicidal people I've
[1:12:30] ever seen

[1:12:33] devil he promised you all this stuff and
[1:12:34] you find out I'm so miserable I can't
[1:12:36] stand myself
[1:12:39] they're miserable out there they can't
[1:12:40] decide who they are they're getting all
[1:12:42] these changes getting all this stuff
[1:12:44] done we're giving puberty blockers to
[1:12:46] five and seven-year-old kids that's just
[1:12:48] Insanity we're we're doing surgery on
[1:12:50] people changing their gender before
[1:12:52] they're even an adult
[1:12:54] what kind of heathens are we
[1:12:58] just devil possessed
[1:13:01] and that's better than being a Christian
[1:13:06] they think you're odd they think you're
[1:13:07] insane we think they're insane
[1:13:12] they walk in and said look at you insane
[1:13:14] people yo I got natural hair color
[1:13:22] where are your nose rings for goodness
[1:13:24] sakes how can you be happy without a
[1:13:26] nose ring I don't see any tax
[1:13:31] and all you identify as the gender uh
[1:13:35] prescribe that birth
[1:13:40] you must be miserable
[1:13:44] a sign that bro that's the word I mean
[1:13:45] let me ask you something how
[1:13:48] if I if my boss will fire me if she
[1:13:50] hears but that's okay
[1:13:52] how do you assign a gender at Birth when
[1:13:55] the person comes out of the womb that
[1:13:58] way
[1:14:00] they come out either male or female in
[1:14:02] the doctor and it says hmm
[1:14:05] eeny meeny miny moe oh we got 50
[1:14:08] hundreds of genders so let's assign this
[1:14:11] gender over here it's not actually a
[1:14:13] gender but we'll make one up for it
[1:14:15] it's not a signed up birth is a sign
[1:14:17] that conception
[1:14:18] in fact it's a sign in God's mind before
[1:14:20] the foundation of the world if you're
[1:14:21] one of his that's right he knew what you
[1:14:24] were going to be
[1:14:26] I still ain't come to the best part here
[1:14:31] he said oh that kind of hit it to
[1:14:33] torment us before the time and there was
[1:14:34] a good way off from them and heard of
[1:14:36] many swine feeding this Devils we saw
[1:14:39] him saying
[1:14:40] listen
[1:14:42] if thou be I'm sorry if thou casteth out
[1:14:44] suffer us go away into the hurtless line
[1:14:46] the Devils were asking Mercy
[1:14:49] don't send us back to Hell let us go
[1:14:50] into the pigs
[1:14:53] they are asking mercy and and this is
[1:14:56] the best part I said if thou cast us out
[1:15:00] it wasn't can you
[1:15:03] there was no question
[1:15:06] there was no like well we're gonna try
[1:15:08] and stay here they knew he had the
[1:15:10] authority to say go and he did all he
[1:15:12] said was go he didn't scream or shout or
[1:15:15] do anything he just said go
[1:15:17] to do off they go
[1:15:20] because he knew who he was
[1:15:23] if thou cast this out friends do you
[1:15:26] recognize that you had that same
[1:15:28] Authority
[1:15:30] when God reveals to you something and
[1:15:32] you stand the authority of the word you
[1:15:34] can go to that whatever that situation
[1:15:35] is and there's no question that devil
[1:15:38] has to go
[1:15:39] he can't stay there if all all the
[1:15:42] devils in hell were there they have to
[1:15:44] go because you're standing on the
[1:15:45] authority of the word because you know
[1:15:47] who you are
[1:15:49] you know who you are you've been
[1:15:51] identified the word has identified you
[1:15:53] the token is on display in your life and
[1:15:56] you can see who you are and the Devils
[1:15:58] know who you are and if you go up and
[1:16:00] pray for someone and then you pray to
[1:16:02] cast them out and that devil says well
[1:16:04] who are you
[1:16:07] I'm way ahead of myself I'm gonna back
[1:16:09] up we'll get to that later Lord willing
[1:16:13] but friends recognize who you are you
[1:16:16] are here as the bride of Christ all hell
[1:16:18] all Heaven is for you all hell is
[1:16:21] against you and with the revelation of
[1:16:22] Jesus Christ the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:16:25] Prevail against you
[1:16:27] you know what the problem is we're
[1:16:29] afraid of the gates of hell
[1:16:32] if the gates of hell are around you need
[1:16:34] to go down and kick it down don't be
[1:16:36] afraid of it don't make some compromise
[1:16:38] don't sit back as well if you leave me
[1:16:39] alone I'll leave you alone don't leave
[1:16:41] them alone
[1:16:43] they're Bluff
[1:16:45] all he is is a bluff and Friends Satan
[1:16:48] will try to Bluff you and try to Bluff
[1:16:49] you but he knows if you're a buff or not
[1:16:51] and here's the thing you can be a
[1:16:52] born-again child of God and go to pray
[1:16:54] for someone and the devil just looks
[1:16:56] like you like whatever
[1:16:59] because you don't have that Revelation
[1:17:01] enough of who you are it's not it's
[1:17:04] clear enough it's you don't have the
[1:17:05] Revelation even to pray for that
[1:17:07] situation or to do with that because you
[1:17:08] haven't wrestled it out with God enough
[1:17:10] to get to that point
[1:17:12] yeah
[1:17:14] a baby is born to a family
[1:17:17] at a very young age maybe from birth
[1:17:19] that that that baby can identify who mom
[1:17:22] is
[1:17:23] if you asked him who's mom he'd go
[1:17:27] he can't say anything but something
[1:17:29] decided to identify he gets a little
[1:17:31] older he says dada mama he can sort of
[1:17:34] identify he gets an order he said that's
[1:17:35] my dad that's my mom he's starting to
[1:17:37] identify who he is oh I belong to this
[1:17:39] family
[1:17:40] and the older he gets the more he can
[1:17:43] identify who he is see brother Brown
[1:17:44] said once the bridalizes who she is
[1:17:46] recognizes who she is the rapture goes
[1:17:49] you say well we all know her bride was
[1:17:50] taking so long because we're going
[1:17:52] through a growing process because we had
[1:17:53] to come to a point where we take over
[1:17:55] dad's business
[1:17:57] watch that business it should cast
[1:18:00] Devils out and send them back to hell
[1:18:04] I hope it's okay for me to say that
[1:18:06] Jesus had mercy and they said go to the
[1:18:08] pigs
[1:18:09] I'm going to say go back to hell
[1:18:13] I hope that's all right
[1:18:16] hey they drowned the pigs they had to
[1:18:18] get out of them anyway so they still
[1:18:20] have a place to go
[1:18:22] that's our job friends is to withstand
[1:18:25] Satan withstand the devil to be the
[1:18:27] light in this world to be Christ in this
[1:18:28] generation
[1:18:30] but until we grow up and it doesn't come
[1:18:32] you grow into it you go battles to your
[1:18:35] tryouts to your dancers all these things
[1:18:37] you keep growing and growing until Dad
[1:18:39] hands you the checkbook he hands you the
[1:18:40] keys to the truck and you go down to the
[1:18:42] bank and said I need a loan and they say
[1:18:44] sign your name I don't need my dad's
[1:18:45] signature no you got the same Authority
[1:18:48] he does
[1:18:51] are you there
[1:18:53] [Applause]
[1:18:54] are you there
[1:18:59] do you stand there in front of the devil
[1:19:01] and say
[1:19:02] I know who I am
[1:19:04] and I Know Who You Are
[1:19:06] and you're gonna leave
[1:19:08] because my papa told me to tell you to
[1:19:10] get out
[1:19:15] it's true he has to go
[1:19:18] friends you can be anointed and scream
[1:19:20] and shout and pray and anoint with oil
[1:19:22] and everything over that person but if
[1:19:24] you don't have the authority to stand
[1:19:26] there and knowing who you are that
[1:19:27] Devil's gonna just sit there and go do
[1:19:30] if you don't care
[1:19:33] but will you stand there with the
[1:19:34] authority know who you are you're not
[1:19:36] bluffing anymore and he knows you're not
[1:19:38] bluffing he's got to go remember when
[1:19:39] was it uh
[1:19:43] Peter and John right at the gate they
[1:19:44] walk by and that person is asking alms
[1:19:46] he said silver and gold have another one
[1:19:48] I have what I give I give to you what I
[1:19:50] have I give to you and why did he picked
[1:19:52] him up and that man jumped up right away
[1:19:53] he started jumping and shouting and
[1:19:55] being he was healed a lot you know what
[1:19:56] that devil never said that devil never
[1:19:58] said well you can't do that that devil
[1:20:00] recognized the authority of those men
[1:20:01] and he goes out of there and he was
[1:20:03] fleeing out of there he's I'm out of
[1:20:04] here man you could go ahead and walk
[1:20:07] because he knew that it was not a
[1:20:08] question of candidate it was if you cast
[1:20:11] me out I said yes we're going to cast
[1:20:12] you out now go
[1:20:17] part of the problem is when it doesn't
[1:20:19] happen immediately like that we start
[1:20:20] doubting
[1:20:23] you lay your hands on the sick to be
[1:20:24] prayed for and to heal him and it you
[1:20:27] know we pray and we believe and then it
[1:20:29] doesn't happen and it doesn't happen we
[1:20:31] start wondering well maybe well maybe uh
[1:20:35] what do you mean maybe
[1:20:37] what do you mean baby
[1:20:39] is it God's word or is it not he's just
[1:20:42] testing you to see if you believe who
[1:20:44] you say you are
[1:20:46] that's all it is he's just testing you
[1:20:52] if thou cast this out
[1:20:55] I love it it's time to torment Devil's
[1:20:57] friends it's time for us to stand up and
[1:20:59] be the bride of Christ
[1:21:04] notice
[1:21:06] excuse me how much time do I okay
[1:21:08] being personally identified by the
[1:21:10] original headship
[1:21:12] we have the answer to the devil's
[1:21:14] question
[1:21:16] by being personally identified not
[1:21:19] Church identified personal just you
[1:21:22] if no one else in this church is
[1:21:24] identified by the original headship you
[1:21:26] are you are
[1:21:28] I am that's what brother Brandon said if
[1:21:30] one person in your city goes in the
[1:21:31] Rapture you got to know it's you
[1:21:34] sorry for the rest of you because I'm
[1:21:36] gone
[1:21:37] no because I taught myself into no
[1:21:39] because it's been proven the Holy Spirit
[1:21:41] has identified Who I Am by the
[1:21:43] revelation of Jesus Christ to me
[1:21:45] personally
[1:21:46] personally identified you as an
[1:21:48] individual identified by the original
[1:21:51] headship what's that that's the pure
[1:21:53] word living through you manifesting what
[1:21:55] the word is supposed to manifest in this
[1:21:56] day
[1:21:58] as an individual
[1:22:00] not my church just you
[1:22:07] we had the answer to the devil's
[1:22:09] question he Christ has risen has paid
[1:22:11] the price and raising up the body
[1:22:13] let me skip down a little bit just to
[1:22:15] save time he said you think I'd be
[1:22:17] signed myself I'm not we've got the
[1:22:19] devil's answer it's not me that liveth
[1:22:21] but Christ the word living in me
[1:22:24] I have no power over any demon I am not
[1:22:28] smart enough I'm not spiritual enough I
[1:22:30] can overcome anything I can do nothing
[1:22:32] but it's not me it's him was living in
[1:22:34] me and he's identifying Christ and flesh
[1:22:37] today it's the very mystery
[1:22:39] be that God wants you to know it's
[1:22:41] Christ in you the hope of glory it's not
[1:22:44] me it's him and me and Satan hates you
[1:22:46] for that
[1:22:48] because that's where he has the biggest
[1:22:49] struggle is when Christ forget in a
[1:22:51] human being and start manifesting
[1:22:53] yourself and Satan can't stop it he can
[1:22:56] stop religion he can stop all kinds of
[1:22:58] movements he can stop anointings but he
[1:23:00] cannot stop Christ and flesh the hope of
[1:23:02] glory
[1:23:04] you can't stop it
[1:23:07] we got the devil's answer it's not me
[1:23:09] but Christ that liveth in me
[1:23:11] now we are the sons of God not will not
[1:23:14] we will be but we are
[1:23:16] oh that's such a great Doctrine that's
[1:23:19] such a great thing to confess now I am a
[1:23:21] Son of God and I am a son of God
[1:23:24] does it prove does your life prove that
[1:23:28] or do you just try to get religious to
[1:23:29] try to work something up Fred don't work
[1:23:31] anything out just let the Holy Spirit
[1:23:33] Come and prove Who You Are
[1:23:36] you're his witness let him use you to
[1:23:38] witness the kingdom of God is within you
[1:23:42] what does that even mean
[1:23:45] if the kingdom of God is within you that
[1:23:47] means there's a king residing within you
[1:23:50] and when a king resides and so he can
[1:23:53] take Dominion
[1:23:57] and he is looking for somebody to take
[1:24:00] dominion over this Earth to take
[1:24:02] dominion over Devils he's looking for
[1:24:04] someone's hands and arms and mouth and
[1:24:07] heart and body to use so he can take
[1:24:09] dominion over everything he's supposed
[1:24:11] to take dominion over in this age and
[1:24:13] that means every devil
[1:24:16] oh he's looking for someone who
[1:24:18] recognizes who they are they come to
[1:24:20] places dad give me the checkbook I'm
[1:24:22] ready to go to battle I'm ready to go to
[1:24:25] work I'm ready to do what you asked me
[1:24:26] to do because I recognize who I am
[1:24:32] it's not just
[1:24:35] I gotta get down here it's not just an
[1:24:38] anointing
[1:24:40] you get a church
[1:24:44] so many times
[1:24:47] okay I'm sorry I have to go here
[1:24:51] I don't go to youth services meetings
[1:24:53] too much anymore they said I'm too old
[1:24:55] they kick me out right
[1:24:56] but I talked to a lot of people who do I
[1:24:58] got friends that go there and they talk
[1:25:00] about and you could use Services here
[1:25:02] and you know it's a wonderful atmosphere
[1:25:04] and the kids are all up front and
[1:25:05] they're they're anointed and they're
[1:25:07] praising God and this wonderful
[1:25:08] atmosphere
[1:25:10] saying anything against that
[1:25:13] but six weeks later you can talk to them
[1:25:17] they haven't changed
[1:25:19] some of them some of them absolutely
[1:25:21] changed wonderful
[1:25:22] but so many you talk to him and said
[1:25:24] why'd you go to the front because
[1:25:25] everyone else did
[1:25:27] that's one of the worst reasons to go to
[1:25:29] the front
[1:25:32] what are you going from because I wanted
[1:25:33] to feel the anointing
[1:25:38] that's not the new birth
[1:25:41] you can feel that really and then what
[1:25:43] happens is they start going from one
[1:25:45] your service to the next to the next
[1:25:46] because it's like getting at their high
[1:25:48] like they're addicted and I have to go
[1:25:49] get another anointing so I can feel good
[1:25:52] but that relationship with Christ isn't
[1:25:55] there
[1:25:56] for so many of them I'm not
[1:25:59] please I am not diminishing Youth
[1:26:01] Services I think they're incredibly
[1:26:03] vital incredibly helpful but but we got
[1:26:05] to make sure the kids know what they're
[1:26:06] looking for don't look on my hair
[1:26:08] looking for a sensation don't come
[1:26:09] looking up Eric should jump in bubble
[1:26:11] dance of that why are you dancing why
[1:26:13] are you shouting I believe in shouting I
[1:26:15] believe in dancing but why are you doing
[1:26:17] it just because you feel something
[1:26:19] all right
[1:26:21] that will never put you in a rupture
[1:26:25] let's be honest
[1:26:30] oh my
[1:26:32] God now we are sons of God now we will
[1:26:34] be we are now we're redeemed we have
[1:26:35] Satan's answer God Vindicated himself
[1:26:38] God proved himself to his promise in
[1:26:41] this day the headship is here that's his
[1:26:43] answer who are you I am the
[1:26:45] manifestation of the word for this day
[1:26:47] that's who I am who are you
[1:26:50] you're a devil going to a devil's hell
[1:26:53] you're going to be totally annihilated
[1:26:54] and we are not even when you're not even
[1:26:56] a member anymore I'm still going to be
[1:26:58] alive and well
[1:27:00] torment the Devils with that instead of
[1:27:03] letting them kick you around tell them
[1:27:04] about their future home they come and
[1:27:06] say well you're not going to the Rapture
[1:27:07] you don't know that devil don't know if
[1:27:09] you're going in the Rapture or not so
[1:27:10] quit listening to what he has to say
[1:27:12] because he got he's got a mountain as
[1:27:14] high as this building with all the
[1:27:16] evidence proving that you're not a
[1:27:17] Christian and all you have is one little
[1:27:19] promise from God and so you got one
[1:27:21] little promise in here you got Satan's
[1:27:23] pile of evidence to prove that you're
[1:27:25] not
[1:27:26] a believer
[1:27:28] you say I'll take this
[1:27:33] I'll take this
[1:27:34] because this will last when the world is
[1:27:37] gone and everything Heaven and Earth
[1:27:38] will pass away but this promise can't
[1:27:40] pass away that means all his lies will
[1:27:43] pass away but that promise won't pass
[1:27:45] away
[1:27:46] are you a believer
[1:27:49] amen praise the Lord
[1:27:52] oh my
[1:27:55] God man was put here with dominion over
[1:27:56] the Earth he had everything under his
[1:27:58] control Adam lost it Jesus prude he had
[1:28:00] restored he stopped nature raids that
[1:28:01] they did another thing the world is
[1:28:03] growing today the Bible said for the
[1:28:04] manifestations of the sons of God
[1:28:07] the whole world you know why it's going
[1:28:09] crazy out there nature is waiting for
[1:28:11] you and I to come to our place where we
[1:28:13] take minion like we're supposed to yeah
[1:28:18] for God to get into his children again
[1:28:19] in reality and make things real
[1:28:23] is
[1:28:25] stumbles the people he gave them
[1:28:27] dominion over the Earth
[1:28:30] but his Fallen estate dropped that but
[1:28:32] what they lost by Adam it was restored
[1:28:34] by Christ
[1:28:35] we had to be restored back go listen to
[1:28:38] gadget Christ is a mystery that third
[1:28:40] phase is to take all the way back to
[1:28:42] everything Adam and even Eve lost in
[1:28:44] Eden is restored to us
[1:28:47] we needed to stop believing what the
[1:28:49] word says about us friends
[1:28:55] amen
[1:28:57] kingdom of God within you friends let me
[1:28:59] just see if I can just quit here
[1:29:08] you must be identified Brother Brad says
[1:29:10] this is spiritual Amnesia you must be
[1:29:12] identified somewhere you must show your
[1:29:14] live shows tonight where you are
[1:29:16] identified
[1:29:19] you identified either in Christ or out
[1:29:22] of Christ
[1:29:25] your life bruising
[1:29:29] you are not halfway
[1:29:32] a friend of mine was talking to the
[1:29:33] sister just recently
[1:29:35] Church having service he went up to he
[1:29:36] said are you are you born again
[1:29:39] she said I don't know
[1:29:43] well I do
[1:29:46] if you don't know you're probably not
[1:29:49] that doesn't mean you're not going to
[1:29:51] have doubts and Satan's going to prove
[1:29:52] you're not that's what I'm talking about
[1:29:53] at all
[1:29:56] but when it comes down to that question
[1:29:58] sinks down deep You're Going To Know Who
[1:30:00] You Are
[1:30:01] if you take God out his word
[1:30:04] you're not halfway
[1:30:06] there's no such thing as a drunk sober
[1:30:08] man there's no black white bird you're
[1:30:09] either saved or you're not saved you're
[1:30:12] a saint or a sinner one or the other
[1:30:16] listen to this please
[1:30:17] your spiritual attitude towards God's
[1:30:21] word identifies you exactly where you're
[1:30:24] standing
[1:30:27] what is your spiritual attitude towards
[1:30:29] God's word
[1:30:33] it tells you who you are
[1:30:34] Satan sees that he sees your attitude
[1:30:37] towards the word
[1:30:39] and then when you come to pray and he
[1:30:41] knows you're bluffing he just laughs at
[1:30:43] you
[1:30:46] but if your spiritual attitude towards
[1:30:48] the word is I'm a Believer and no matter
[1:30:50] what this circumstance no matter what
[1:30:51] Satan puts on me no matter what's going
[1:30:53] on no matter how much I fail no matter
[1:30:55] what so all this stuff going on but I
[1:30:56] know I'm a Believer because I've been
[1:30:58] identified by the word itself
[1:31:01] then when you walk up he starts you know
[1:31:03] what he'll do he's such a he is he's a
[1:31:06] car he's a boy and while he'll do he'll
[1:31:08] stop backing if you walk toward he'll
[1:31:09] back up and says come on man I ain't
[1:31:10] afraid of you
[1:31:12] come on you gotta pray for him I don't
[1:31:14] care
[1:31:15] yeah I'm not afraid of you he's backed
[1:31:18] up the whole time
[1:31:20] he is because he knows who you are
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:24] yes he knows that you have authority
[1:31:26] over him he'll scream and shout and
[1:31:28] Bluff and do everything else but when
[1:31:30] you speak he's got to go because it's
[1:31:32] the word of God speaking through you
[1:31:33] it's not your own word and you cannot go
[1:31:35] and do this well if I do that I'm gonna
[1:31:37] go heal people I'm gonna save them I'm
[1:31:39] gonna do it no you're not because you
[1:31:40] don't get that kind of authority until
[1:31:42] you got the the the character to handle
[1:31:45] it
[1:31:45] God don't give you the checkbook until
[1:31:47] he says okay you're ready to be led by
[1:31:49] the spirit remember Jesus could himself
[1:31:51] he had to do what the spirit led him to
[1:31:53] do he wanted that pull up it says the
[1:31:55] Bethesda or whatever that was he walked
[1:31:57] up there and there's one man
[1:32:00] and he healed and he walked away there's
[1:32:02] all these other sick people around
[1:32:04] you think Jesus the man did not want to
[1:32:06] heal every one of them
[1:32:09] of course he did
[1:32:11] he said I always that was pleased with
[1:32:13] the father all that my father showed to
[1:32:14] me that what to do if you don't show me
[1:32:16] something I don't do it and that's the
[1:32:17] same thing with the mature bride of
[1:32:19] Christ and she will go and do what he
[1:32:21] says and she won't do anything else with
[1:32:22] it because that's not what his will is
[1:32:25] see human Humanity doesn't understand
[1:32:27] that at all they think if he's a god of
[1:32:29] Mercy he should just save everybody
[1:32:31] well he's given a chance
[1:32:33] they just don't love this God of Mercy
[1:32:35] that's the problem they love their own
[1:32:37] God
[1:32:40] the Satan will say when you die you're
[1:32:42] lost
[1:32:43] say you're wrong
[1:32:45] I have the perfectest product I'm the
[1:32:46] purchase product I have the token what
[1:32:48] is the token listen to this he knows
[1:32:51] what it is
[1:32:52] don't fool with him he knows what it is
[1:32:55] now you might talk to these preachers
[1:32:57] they'd argue if you're not Satan he
[1:32:58] knows better he came against it two or
[1:32:59] three times you know made a mistake of
[1:33:01] Temptation Satan knows what you're
[1:33:02] talking about just show that token he'll
[1:33:04] fly
[1:33:06] Satan knows if you're bluffing or not
[1:33:10] he knows it
[1:33:13] can read one more quote
[1:33:18] they try to figure out Jesus how do you
[1:33:20] do these things what done it he he said
[1:33:22] I'll ask you a question
[1:33:24] was the ministry of John the Baptist was
[1:33:26] it a God or was it a man they said we
[1:33:28] can't say he said neither do I tell you
[1:33:29] that's right he went on
[1:33:32] he wasn't going to mess with those
[1:33:34] make-believing lukewarm so-called
[1:33:36] believers
[1:33:39] from henceforth no man asked him
[1:33:40] anything he just cut them off
[1:33:43] when Satan comes and starts tormenting
[1:33:45] in your mind about something whatever
[1:33:47] just cut him off
[1:33:49] don't argue with the devil you're going
[1:33:51] to lose every argument with the devil
[1:33:52] all right because that's all he wants
[1:33:54] you to do just cut him off just take
[1:33:56] them and say hey satan this is the word
[1:33:58] now shut up
[1:34:00] and walk away
[1:34:02] will he quit tormenting me he might he
[1:34:04] might not
[1:34:06] would you still do the same thing
[1:34:09] don't start picking up an argument with
[1:34:10] him he'll just get you all wore out and
[1:34:12] stressed
[1:34:14] he just cut them off he didn't tell them
[1:34:17] nothing about it none of their business
[1:34:19] he had a work to do and he finished it
[1:34:21] oh my what an attitude it's none of your
[1:34:24] business someone wants to come argue
[1:34:25] with was the prophet right about this
[1:34:27] was he right about this
[1:34:29] you know what go argue with someone else
[1:34:31] I ain't got time for you devil
[1:34:34] I ain't got time to discuss this with
[1:34:36] you because you don't want to find an
[1:34:37] excuse not to believe the message is
[1:34:39] true you want to listen to some devil
[1:34:40] that told you it's not true because you
[1:34:42] can't explain everything the prophet
[1:34:43] said
[1:34:44] you would have done the same thing but
[1:34:46] Jesus well he said except you drink my
[1:34:47] blood and eat my flesh you have no part
[1:34:49] in me and they said this is a hard thing
[1:34:51] who can say it we can't understand this
[1:34:52] and they walked away that's why they're
[1:34:54] walking away from the message today
[1:34:55] because they can't understand everything
[1:34:57] prophecy and the reason he said the
[1:34:59] things the way he did is so they would
[1:35:01] walk away
[1:35:03] he has to cut them loose because they're
[1:35:05] just hanging on they're just they're
[1:35:06] just hair in the biscuit they're just
[1:35:08] gonna be a problem they're bringing that
[1:35:10] nasty spirit and we need to get that out
[1:35:12] of here so we can have the fellowship of
[1:35:13] Jesus Christ
[1:35:17] hey man
[1:35:20] it's none of their business he had to
[1:35:22] work today he finished it not help us to
[1:35:25] do the same thing that's what your
[1:35:26] Prophet said do the same thing he said
[1:35:28] we don't have to answer the devil's
[1:35:30] question
[1:35:34] we don't have to answer the devil's
[1:35:36] question if thou be so and so you're
[1:35:39] responsible for that Gospel of preachers
[1:35:42] and that's all not how it's written it's
[1:35:44] just responsible for saying it I'm not
[1:35:46] response for anything but say what he
[1:35:48] gave me to say tonight and if you will
[1:35:50] hear what I'm saying my words they have
[1:35:52] spirit and they have life and you can
[1:35:54] receive what you want from Jesus Christ
[1:35:56] tonight because he set me up here with
[1:35:58] the word to tell you that he's here to
[1:36:00] take care of your needs if you'll just
[1:36:02] stand and believe who you are
[1:36:04] that's all you have to do that's all you
[1:36:06] have to do is accept your spiritual
[1:36:08] attitude towards the word it dictates
[1:36:10] who you are and where you stand tonight
[1:36:14] personally
[1:36:17] oh
[1:36:20] praise the Lord
[1:36:22] [Music]
[1:36:23] all he ever wants all he wants is just
[1:36:26] that relationship with he just
[1:36:29] he just wants you
[1:36:32] he don't want your religion
[1:36:37] your son's a schema they came and they
[1:36:40] said hey I think we're going to identify
[1:36:41] ourselves as some Holiness preachers
[1:36:43] here we're going to cast out some devils
[1:36:47] and they try to do it without the
[1:36:49] authority of the word
[1:36:52] it says those Devils say you know he
[1:36:53] said in the name of Jesus whom Paul
[1:36:55] preaches and that devil said you know
[1:36:57] Jesus we know Paul
[1:37:00] I'm not sure who you are
[1:37:03] they kicked their tail clear out of all
[1:37:05] seven of them naked and wounded
[1:37:09] yeah
[1:37:11] what about you
[1:37:13] who are you
[1:37:18] Jesus I know
[1:37:21] Paul I know
[1:37:22] brother random I know
[1:37:25] brother Thomas I know
[1:37:28] who are you
[1:37:32] who are you
[1:37:34] this is a question you
[1:37:37] ask her personally
[1:37:39] you can ask your pastor Who You Are
[1:37:42] you can ask your mom or dad Who You Are
[1:37:44] you have to know from God he's the only
[1:37:46] one who can reveal it to you
[1:37:49] and the way you get that is because you
[1:37:51] and him have a relationship because you
[1:37:53] wrestle it out with him
[1:37:56] it's not well I have a 10 minute prayer
[1:37:57] and he didn't say anything so I'll just
[1:37:59] go do something else
[1:38:05] every day
[1:38:07] well I'm busy brother Phil
[1:38:11] okay
[1:38:12] well I tell you what when you're in the
[1:38:14] when you're in the tribulation period
[1:38:17] you're gonna be busy
[1:38:19] like you never thought be busy
[1:38:21] because you're too busy to have a
[1:38:23] relationship with Christ he said I'm too
[1:38:24] busy to put you in a rapture
[1:38:29] what is what is eternal life worth to
