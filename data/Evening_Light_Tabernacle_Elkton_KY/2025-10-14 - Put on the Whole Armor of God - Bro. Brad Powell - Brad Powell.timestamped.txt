[0:00] And I got to thinking about that and I
[0:02] thought, you know what? We as
[0:04] Christians,
[0:05] we are in a spiritual warfare tonight.
[0:08] We live every day we get up out of the
[0:11] bed and our feet hit the floor. We are
[0:13] in a war. We are in a battle. And I
[0:16] don't know about you, but I don't always
[0:18] want to be on the defense.
[0:22] When you're in the defense, you're
[0:23] always taking blows.
[0:28] You're always taking blows when you're
[0:30] on the defense. You say, "Well, a boxer
[0:33] puts up his guard and he's guarding
[0:34] himself." We got the shield of We got
[0:36] the shield of faith. We got
[0:37] righteousness. We got truth. We got
[0:39] prayer. We got all of those weapons.
[0:41] We've got the word of God. But what good
[0:44] does it do you to have the word of God
[0:46] if you never swing your sword?
[0:53] and we sit back and we defend against
[0:55] everything.
[0:57] Oh, the devil's hitting my my finances.
[1:00] Oh, the devil, he's he's hitting my
[1:02] children. The devil's hitting my home,
[1:05] my marriage. The devil's hitting me over
[1:08] here. I I've lost my zeal.
[1:12] You're putting up your guard and you're
[1:14] taking lick after lick after lick. You
[1:17] ever seen a boxer, they put them in the
[1:18] ropes and they just wear them out?
[1:21] Some of us let the devil throw us in the
[1:23] ropes and just wear us out.
[1:29] Why?
[1:31] Quit living as a department of defense
[1:34] and find yourself as a department of war
[1:37] and fight your battles. Pull out the
[1:40] sword.
[1:42] Lord,
[1:47] &gt;&gt; we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[1:49] but against principalities.
[1:53] You see, the life of the believer
[1:56] is against spiritual enemies.
[2:00] And we don't have to back down from
[2:01] these enemies.
[2:03] Think about it. Listen what the word
[2:05] says. Finally, my brethren, be strong in
[2:06] the Lord in the power of his might. put
[2:08] on the whole armor of God
[2:11] that you may be able to stand against
[2:13] the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not
[2:15] against flesh and blood, against
[2:17] principalities, against powers and
[2:19] rulers of the darkness of this world,
[2:20] against spiritual wickedness in high
[2:22] places. Therefore take unto you the
[2:24] whole armor,
[2:32] the whole armor, truth,
[2:34] righteousness,
[2:36] peace,
[2:38] salvation.
[2:40] This is the armor, the word of God. And
[2:44] when you've done all to withstand in the
[2:46] evil day, having done all to stand,
[2:50] stand therefore.
[2:52] You know, when you you look at the
[2:54] military and you look at the the
[2:55] military uh attire of the day that this
[2:58] is being described, you're putting on
[2:59] the whole armor, you got your helmet,
[3:01] you got your shield, you got your sword,
[3:03] you got all this armor on the front, but
[3:05] you know where you're not covered up
[3:08] in the back.
[3:11] You see, God doesn't plan on his
[3:13] children fleeing from the scene of the
[3:15] battle.
[3:17] You may get down. You may get knocked
[3:19] down. You may feel like you're depressed
[3:21] and defeated and you've been been
[3:23] overtaken by the enemy, but you never
[3:25] turn your back. You're too exposed
[3:28] standing face to face and say, "God,
[3:31] help me fight this battle.
[3:34] I stand on the word of God, so help me
[3:37] fight this battle.
