but I could hear you play Real Clear sounds like everybody worship thank you musicians Amen brother Josh thank you it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen for a midweek service amen God is good amen praise the Lord amen get to see everybody amen let's just bow our heads gracious and kind Heavenly Father we once again come before your throne of grace Lord thanking you father for your goodness to us Lord Jesus and for all that you mean to us Lord for all that you do Lord Jesus and have done Lord and will do it for your word that you have sent us Lord that's a rock to our lives father Lord we just ask God that you'd come again Lord Jesus and help me just to get out of the way that you might speak to your people what you once said Lord and father we ask Lord you bless the meditation of our heart father in that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak tonight father may you just come and especially anoint the service now we welcome you to come to speak to us along the way father in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen turn your bibles if you will let's go to the uh to the Book of Psalms I think we'll go Psalms 34. amen I think tonight we have a brand new message even kind of something I don't remember speaking on before amen that's kind of hard for me to do amen but uh anyway so I'm sure I've covered it it covered it in one way or the other but amen perhaps just a different way so Psalm 34 I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord to Humble shall hear thereof and be glad o magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all of my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this man this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles the angel of the Lord encampeth around about them that fear Him fear fear Him and delivereth them oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusts in the Lord amen amen Psalms 81 Psalms 81 and I want to read just one verse and perhaps we'll come back and pick up some of the other scriptures that I'd like to touch on but for now we'll just lead read uh um the last verse because I'll get my title from this verse 16 81 and 16 says he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee amen God bless the reading of the words you can be seated I want to title this honey out of the Rock Amen honey out of the rock praise be to God amen and I want to really speak about healing amen healing amen I got to thinking about healing you know because you know most of the time we think about healing we think about perhaps just our physical body you know but healing uh if you have need of healing it means that you are not in the state that you once was and you need to be redeemed back to what you was once amen back to a a a perfect condition not a fallen condition but a a perfect condition and we realize that the whole world needs healing isn't that right everybody every even though we were all in a big hole and and wounded and and dying so to speak and everybody needs healing tonight and I got to thinking about uh and I'm just gonna go here for now in Hebrews 12. this scripture God come to me when I thought about healing amen and how that uh uh you know we we needed so much in the age that we live in and something that prophet of God said that I want to amen just start with amen and it's in Hebrews the 12th chapter amen Hebrews the 12th chapter and we're gonna read from 11 to 13. amen not no chastening of for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterwards it yield us the Peaceable fruit of rightness unto them which are exercise thereby amen wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees makes and makes straight paths for your feet at least at least that which is be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed amen so Paul talking about here and I ran across is looking for it and of course Jesus doesn't have a reference but I couldn't help but think that perhaps Paul amen must have read the book of Isaiah and over in Isaiah 35 I'll just go quickly go to it 35 and 3 it says strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees amen so perhaps Paul Paul picked this up you know because he got the talking about wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees in other words somebody that's down somebody that's weak isn't that right and the Bible encourages to to build that up and to strengthen it but abandon makes a statement I'm sure that you've heard it before he says if your brother's in air don't push him down amen so you know because honey knows that it's so easy to do when somebody is in air or somebody does something wrong what is the first thing that we do as human beings see we become judgmental right we first of all we want to condemn them you know instead of finding out perhaps wise in that state or what it is you know and trying to you know pick him back up and and so forth and probably God puts it on this way he's as far as he wants to be now further down he don't want to be any further down help him up give him a hand lift him up amen he lived there love him no matter if you can't agree with him love him anyhow amen and so you see when somebody's sick somebody's feeble somebody a man that needs strength in the Bible encourages you know to to strengthen the people and so forth but we uh then I got to thinking about Jesus you know because we're so quick to condemn rather than to have the right words to say to somebody like that are you with me to encourage him to pick him back up and say no come on now you know let's go you can do it and so forth amen and I was in the I was in my devotions I think it was yesterday morning or this morning and and I was just opened my Bible on my lap my iPad and my it popped up there and this this scripture uh it was right there in front of me and I thought wow that that's really neat and so in job job 16 1-5 he says job then answered and said I have heard many such things miserable comforters are y'all hahaha I mean no job didn't have a lot of real comforters what did they do they accused him of having secrets in or he ain't right with God or something wrong with him amen we've heard different preachers and we've said it here before that it's so easy whenever you know we're going down through them we need we need to be patient and love me but when somebody else says a lot of times we're judgmental and so job's saying here you're miserable comforters shall mean words have an end have you ever y'all remember uh the phrase you know putting yourself in somebody else's shoes right well I got a new one for you all right it's right here and it says or what emboldeth boldness thee that thou answer us I also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my soul Stitch all right so job's saying look if you're about you were in here if your soul wasn't here you know then I and I could Heap up words against you and shake my head at you but all right listen he says he wouldn't shake his head into a lot but I would strengthen you with my mouth uh I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving up my lips would assume your grief in other words I do not say something to try to comfort you amen so I think it's true that you know we have to be careful that we say the right thing to somebody that's down are you with me no matter if they're straying a little whatever it is being judgmental is never going to do it remember the first words that Jesus said when he come to the world John 3 16 I believe it was amen and I know if I can quote it just perfect like but Jesus says I came not to condemn the world that was not his purpose of coming was to condemn everybody now we know there's going to come at a time now condemnation I'm in those to condemn are to judge I'm not here to judge you now but I'm here to save you I'm not here to condemn you but he's here to save and that's God's purpose today and I believe it will be to uh until the last Christian and say we're going out of here because even Jesus said blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy why do you think that he didn't condemn the woman caught in a very active adultery isn't that right he didn't condemn her even the Pharisees they had picked up Souls isn't that right they were ready they were ready to get down but Jesus come along and says you know he that he's without sin cast the first stone I imagine we had a holy ghost service right there don't you I imagine the atmosphere was there so strong that it condemned everybody huh I don't know I don't care if there was Paul in there I don't care for somebody that was dogmatic in there that would like to just go ahead and throw the first stone there was such a presence nobody could throw us through huh what an atmosphere that must have been that he had created and that was there and he went riding on the fan you know what I don't know what he wrote but anyway he was writing on the sand and everybody what did they do went back to the house hopefully to repent to think about their own faults now this just comes to me is this okay but wouldn't that be probably the way that it would be for a lot of us if we see somebody within the air whatever if you begin to think about your own faults a little bit you realize hey you know I need to keep my mouth shut maybe I need to go a little show a little kind and show a little Grace have a little Mercy and realize you know I'm not just here to condemn because that's not the purpose the purpose is to lift somebody up a Healer to make how many knows that the whole purpose of Calgary was to save the world to heal everybody because everybody needs healing everybody needs to get honey from The Rock oh my don't you just love that Honey in the Rock oh praise the Lord all right now notice that better man he makes a statement he says listen he says that's what's the matter with a lot of our Pentecostal experiences we're lying on something that happened way back Yonder and it gets wiggle tails in it all right can I stop there for a minute that's where you that applies to you that applies to me that we can't just go by our experience of yesterday with the Lord you need a daily experience with the Lord if you don't have a daily walk of daily things that happen to delay the things that God does the daily drinks from the fountain huh you're going to get stale you're gonna get stagnant listen we're going to say he says and they get stale what about today he says today is the time like David says oh taste the honey that's in the Rock David said oh how sweet it was there's something about honey that God likes praise the Lord amen let's read the scripture on on this now we already uh I'm going too fast here now notice let me finish this here all right so he says listen David said it was sweet there's something about honey and I noticed David being a shepherd and that Shepherd used and carried a script bag by their side now that's what I want to get to that script back and in his script back they put honey and when their sheep got sick they would take some of this honey and they would rub it on a rock I'm gonna move this down a little bit rub it on the Rock and the six sheep would go over and get the licking on this rock and while licking the honey off he got Limestone out for the Rock and the Limestone heal the sick sheep praise the Lord amen what a beautiful type today listen friends I got a whole script back here honey and I'm gonna put it on Christ amen put it on Christ I'm gonna put it on Christ on the Rock Christ Jesus and you six sheep you go to licking now and you're sure to get well just as certain as anything lick from Calvary don't look from some Baptist Church in method or some man-made idea you can lick on the wrong kind of things you'll never get well let me know how many know you can go and you can read whatever book you want but you'll never get the satisfaction that you get from reading your Bible this is where you lick from if you're sick it's there I'll make that for that praise be to God began to lick from the lick the honey off of The Rock amen you know David said it this way he says how sweet are thy words unto my taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth amen foreign and then in Psalms 34 and verse 8 this is where we read just a minute ago but it says oh taste and see that the Lord is good amen better man talking about the Pentecostals how uh the way it sounds they would have a service that so Holy Ghost filled and they were just licking from The Rock and he says people would just stand around and go I thought that's kind of strange but I don't want to say anything you get the Holy Ghost or anything anybody does you know that new inspiration but I got to thinking of what does this really mean what does it really mean to taste the Lord no taste and see that the Lord is good David said he's sweeter than the honey and sweet it on the honeycomb our Lord's sweeter than that because in this life we know that we all love good tasting things things that taste good things that are good a good ribeye hello good salad amen all good things and so he begins to bring that over to us and talk about how to taste the Lord and see how good it is but about in many places and talking about Honey in the Rock and he says oh have you tasted it have you ever tasted how good the Lord is well David explains this here he's when he's talking about I Will Bless The Lord at all times I will praise praise continue his praise shall continually be in my mouth why how do you taste it the Lord is good well he said he said look this poor man cried and the Lord heard how many times David cried to the Lord isn't that right up in verse 4 he says I sought the Lord and he heard me and he delivered me out of all my fears amen when God delivers you when you actually are delivered up something just like Israel when they were delivered of the Egyptians when they come over to the other side oh my they've got so good that Miriam just beginner oh man she couldn't stand good couldn't stand it come on sisters let's go dancing how many never heard the Sweet Taste of victory the harder to battle the sweeter the victory amen and so that's how you taste the Lord the way I see it that's how you taste how good God is in your life Amen brother man I knew what it was like to get a real taste listen when we talk about this get this because the how many knows that Jesus Christ God he is the Holy Ghost so it doesn't matter how much Bible you read or whatever you've got to get the spirit not just the word but the spirit drink from the spirit link from the spirit so to speak that's what's sweet otherwise yeah he tastes nothing I mean it's just as you draw amen as you draw and as you lick from that rock and whatever you have need of how many knows whatever you have need of whatever the sickness is amen there's healing in Licking that rock licking the honey and getting the and and getting the Limestone that you need praise be the god oh don't you just love that all right this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles now I don't know maybe he was talking about somebody else but I know that I happen to know that David got into a lot of trouble isn't that right he got into a lot of trouble a bear a lion everybody what did God do deliver him oh oh that's so sweet the Sweet Taste of victory folks how many knows we need more of that air life Oh I thought about this thinking about this I thought about this thinking about this that's a new one amen and how does it say you don't you just can't you can't just let the devil run you over you can't yield to Temptation and still keep you going there's nothing sweet about losing the battle it's the agony of defeat you'll feed an egg in the end oh my downhearted driver when you're defeated but didn't make three in your life and you'll be like Miriam oh my praise be to God another story I want to go to let me finish this other one can't lick off of a Baptist Church this out or the other and if there ever was a time that's the sick sheep ought to go to licking it's today amen how many believe that let me know the world is sick it's very sick the only chance they have is to go to The Rock and look oh why do you think that we need church so much that's where you get the water that's where your Honey comes forth that's where the rock is we're not pointing you to a minister Brother Brad me to anywhere not point to him man we're pointing to the man Christ Jesus and his word we're not here to sell some Amway or some other kind of product to this idea all kind of met no this is real how many bleeding how many knows this is real folks this is sure I love it oh my now notice he says in the old days they used to what they had their uh what they called a mad Stone y'all remember the story a person got mad dog bit in other words I believe rabies because I believe it was when one of these quotes you talked about you know they didn't have the rabies medicines or Raby shots anymore back then but the Mad Dog bit and that person was a a got mad dog but they take them to the Mad Stone and if they got stuck if they stuck to the stone they got well but if they didn't stay they died reminds me of the story of uh an eagle going through moping period isn't that right as long as he keeps licking as long as he keeps eating he'll beat them scales off oh my but like our Christian experience brother man said every Christian has to be tried we all have to get way down to that place to where you find out whether you're gonna go on or whether you're not whether you're gonna give up job was there he got there but guess what job how many beliefs he strengthened himself he got he he made it through hey man when we get down to that place and I'll tell you what you have to go and you better keep feeding on the word keep trusting the Lord God will bring you through I mean please but keep feeding on it keep feeding on it if you're bit by the devil if you're I don't care what it is if you're backslit if you've been tempted and and you failed that day guess what get back to the Rock go to licking let me know if there's Grace there's Mercy there's forgiveness that's one of the greatest things that I love that I think is so good that amen If any man feel or come short of the glory of God we haven't advocated the father amen and when you get your sins washed under the blood of Jesus Christ I'll tell you what you'll have joy unspeakable [Music] I never met a happy sinner yet huh amen oh tattooed and sad you know praise be to God talking about talking about being judgmental remember brother bam said one place he says don't condemn The Sinner for sinning don't condemn the drunk before going home and drinking his whiskey and smoking his cigarette and all of this we could say doing his pot don't contend him for that that's the only pleasure that he has but he says show him that what you got is so much better than that how many blazing ain't gonna act real funny under that stuff uh judge us if we get just a little happy with what we drink we might stand here like drunk people too huh I mean please on the day of Pentecost they got a full dose of this honey and they're all they come out of there looking for the devil they weren't afraid of him anymore why they had been filled out with honey from The Rock oh there's Honey in the Rock my brother there's Honey in the Rock for you if you're sad and depressed there's Honey in the Rock for you there's joy in the rock for you even one place brother bam says man there's Honey in the Rock if you're down hollered or whatever it is it's for you it's there for you how many needs more of the joy of the Lord if you're not happy with where you are with the Lord you better go to Lincoln have God talked to you God's word speaking to your heart is more David said it's better to me than honey and the honeycomb does the Lord speak into his heart amen remember Samson one day how many of those remember when he was going down a certain way and a lion come up you know that's brother bam says he says this line looked at him a little running little fella I'm gonna have me a good meal well brother Brandon says you know that he wasn't Samson deciding that I'm gonna kill this thing he said but the difference and what made the difference was the spirit of the Lord came upon him how many blades that's what we need more we need the spirit of the Lord come on but the spirit of the Lord comes on you to make all the difference in the world he slew that diet after a few days he was going back by that way and he decided to go over to visit the lion remember that he went and visited the line and he looked and there was a big old beehive [Music] [Applause] sweet honey I thought that's the Sweet Taste of victory and what did he do he went and took it home for his mom and dad and mom and dad ate it but the Bible says he didn't tell his parents where it was out of you probably wouldn't hate it either if you come from an old rotten wine huh said it said you can tell him where he come from reminds me of the bear story right remember brother bam talked about it yes that molasses in his tent there was him bears and he shoot him away and so forth and but the one wouldn't leave he just would not leave it had no asses all over it and it was just enjoying that sweet love Hallelujah like some of us sometimes getting in the spirit not just enjoying it I'm gonna believe that's what we're going to do to enjoy it praise be to God Lord help us we don't have always have to get beat after this when we come to church we shouldn't always need a whooping no we should be there and say Lord just talk to me some more father amen that's right Hallelujah healing healing in the Rock Amen that honey that's in the rock oh my there's Honey in the Rock tonight how many believe it praise God all right so now notice you know I've often wondered when Moses let the children of Israel through the Wilderness and when he brought him out there was about two million people young old all together he led them for 40 years now just think of that without a sanitation that we have today they had young a lot of young people there how many babies you think were born in a night out of 2 million and then besides that old people and cripples and things and he left in 40 years under the leadership of God in the wilderness 40 years and when they come out it said that it wasn't the feeble one among them oh my wouldn't you like to look at Dr Moses medicine Satchel tonight how many knows that you just think about it now looking in your medicine cabinet folks I go in my medicine cabinet and my vitamin cabinet and they fall out when I open the door there's so many of them I don't know about you look at your boy there's this and there and the other you know not so much the medicine now as it is vitamins but you have your medicine cabinet isn't that right and then if man you know can you imagine I was just thinking about this trying to uh think with Bill abandon here of two million people out there in the wilderness no doctor's offices I don't remember any doctors other than Dr Moses brother Brandon called him Dr Moses right amen and what it had to do listen now so notice he says look at his Satchel to see what he had to keep them well would you like to look at it he says I can show it to you over in the book of Exodus I show you this is his medicine's chest and it sat back there I'll look right into that medicine sack and see what it says and then what did he say it says he says listen it was I am the Lord that healeth all thy diseases that's all he had to go by I may believe he's our healer praise be to God he's our Healer not not just not just for physical healing but for everything praise God when there was a baby boy he said somebody had perhaps appendicitis or broke out with TB or anything like that here's first of all this prescription I'm the Lord that healeth thee that's the only thing that he had I am the Lord that healeth it that's the only thing he had and that is good enough amen every one of them they just prayed for him and he got well and you know another thing happened during the time in the wilderness is they didn't even need any new shoes when they came out and their clothes never got threatened haha can you imagine I imagine somebody just had a little jump and fit once in a while you know the pants is as good as what they were huh my shirt's as good as it was my shoes are good what they were a walking Miracle every day we don't see it so much but you're a walking Miracle every day why because God is supplying all your needs how maybe that's why it's so good that's what tastes so good about the Lord he has promised he would take care of me now and in my future when I come to the door of death if I would in that going to Rapture hopefully I'll go in the rap but he's going to take care of all of it how many believe that the good things what is it that makes the Lord taste so good all of his precious promises said he gives us I'll never leave thee I'll never forsake thee my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Christ Jesus he supplies all our needs how many knows that to see him do it he delivers us out of all our troubles oh my a lot of us should think back think back a little bit and look at the trouble that you've had in your life aren't you glad you're past that aren't you glad you don't have to go through that not that there won't be more troubles but God delivered you out of that wasn't that sweet wasn't that wonderful let me know she's delivered you out of your sin he's forgiven you of all your transgressions watched you why does snow that's what's so good about the Lord that's what tastes so good folks it's sweeter than any kind of a honey it's the sweetest thing in this world but not as sweet as God God is sweeter than honey he's sweeter than a honeycomb he's Pace better than anything else in the world and you can think about many things the devil would try to offer people and he gives people popularity Fame money wealth houses lands more money they know what to spend with that has been hey let me tell you something you got something more precious than that that's sweeter than all the riches of the world to have him he is that sweet honey the cleft of the rock remember that honey that came out of the cleft of the rock that's out of Jesus's side came honey sweeter than honey amen praise be to God Abraham how many knows Abraham needed some healing Abraham and Sarah they needed it what did God do that's at 100 years old Abraham a hundred years or 99 something went there and Sarah at 65 or was it 75. it's 25 years apart been 75 years old it was see they gave it the promise at 65 I believe it was 75 to 85 95.30 it's 25 years anyway but it was so many years and God had to do what heal their bodies change them back just to be able to receive the promise that he had given him I don't know about you brother Glenn but if I got changed back to a young man again remember Sarah and the King down there said come on here I want you to possibly be my wife that's where brother Brandon made the case that she had to be turned back because she wouldn't be 75 years old him and him wanting a grand great grandma but he had changed her back I believe it takes a profit to know those things don't you you and I could probably never pick that out or know that or couldn't say it for sure but he's the prophet of God he that's the one that the word of the Lord comes to that's why he could tell you the color of Eve's higher isn't that right but he seen that once again young how do you end the Rock Honey in the Rock David how it was Honey in the Rock the victory that he had over Goliath and over the Bears how
