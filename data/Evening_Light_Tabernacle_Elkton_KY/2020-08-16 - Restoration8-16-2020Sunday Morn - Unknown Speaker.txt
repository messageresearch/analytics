uh we're better off with our new body isn't that right all right what have we got new batteries all right fix me right up there we are going to uh try a few new things our internet as you know it's a little bit slow so i've talked to a att technician and we're going to this new tower they put up over here is att so we're going to try another route see if it does any better we're going to keep searching until we get something that works real good amen so and then eventually probably get a little better camera too but there's no sense in getting a better camera unless we have better internet so we're going to keep trying y'all just keep praying amen god bless you it's certainly good to be in the house of the lord once again amen knowing that one of these days we're going to meet amen and it's not going to be like this amen it's going to be somewhere else in a much better place so praise the lord um i got some brother jonathan jones coming this coming wednesday to cover for me

down there amen but anyway so god is good and so we'll be leaving tuesday lord willing we'll be leaving tuesday and coming back probably about thursday is what the plan is amen so this morning i can't think of any other announcements amen good to see everybody out this morning amen um just continue to pray for sister becky and those that are in contact with people that have this stuff all the time amen and so we appreciate them being careful amen at this time i believe we need to be careful amen as much as we can be and god will to do the rest of it amen um so let me see i can't think of anything else let's just power heads kind of heavenly father we come before you lord this morning once again on this side of eternity lord jesus thankful to be able to do what you have asked us to do similar selves together in your name lord knowing god that you promised that you'd meet with us lord jesus whatever two or three would agree on anything you do it and we believe lord jesus this morning that you just come and speak to us along the way lord and that you'll help me just get out of the way and use the gift that you've given the church lord jesus to minister and to be ahead of the edification father to the body of christ we love you and we appreciate your father and it makes us love one another lord because we love you and we ask god that you just bless the reading the word meditation of our heart this morning father bless our assembling together now and we ask god that you would you just provide as you have father continued protection lord jesus for us by your spirit and by your power father and we love you lord jesus with all our heart and we pray god that you'll have your divine will to be done this morning now in jesus name amen turn your bibles if you will to joel the second chapter joel 2 and we just greet everybody amen out there on the airwaves wherever you are may god richly bless you amen as we continue our journey amen down this road that we get to finish one day and so uh i was listening brother branham's life story last evening and i was very tempted to play that uh life story this morning amen i said lord if you want me to play that i will but then he seemed to lay something on my heart so but i'll tell you i really enjoy that that life story this will be tying into that just a little bit but that was preached in 59 i know he preached he ministered life story many times but this one he preached in 59 and i enjoyed that uh some of the things that he said amen so praise the lord i may always enjoy his listening to brother branham amen i truly believe that he was the best preacher of this whole generation amen you won't listen to a better preacher than the prophet of god amen so joel 2 and we'll begin with verse 23 joel 2 and verse 23 be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former reign moderately and he will cause to come down to you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month now brother banham taught a double portion of rain amen in that latter rain so and the floor shall be full of wheat and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the canker worm the caterpillar the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be a shame amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning i want to talk about restoration this morning restoration and i'll call it also going back going back amen now most of the time and when we ever we're we don't usually speak so much about going back we usually speak about going forward and not looking back and that right so i've come to the conclusion that there's a time to look back and there's a time not to look back amen just depends on which way you're going and we'll try to cover this for you just for a little bit but let's first of all talk about not looking back and not going back because there's an aspect that you know we as christians we don't look back we don't we don't go back amen but what we don't do is like lot's wife i believe it said over in luke the 17th chapter it says in verse 32 he says remember lot's wife amen remember lot's wife he said so jesus one place there was telling us you know and he was speaking about whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and who whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it amen so you can't look back at your old life and the way that you used to live and amen you can't look to that remember lot's wife she looked back she kind of desired sodom she likes adam and gamora isn't that right because it treated her good she could do whatever she wants she had all the fancy things she had life was good she had her way down there isn't that right you know people like their way people like to do what they want to do they like the deluxe things of life and so forth and the luxuries of life people like and sometimes you know if you aren't careful as a christian you tend to look back back and that's one thing jesus said that he needs to remember that when it comes to that that's not something that you want to do is to look back amen never look back amen look only forward amen only direction that you want to look is forward because we know that she because she did how many knows the angel that says you know leave this place and don't look back minute so they all left the place but she's the only one that turned to look back and because she looked back she was turned into a pillar of salt and is there i guess as a memorial even unto today not right so there's times and things that you want there's certainly things that you don't want to look back to that's your old life amen and so over and also in luke the ninth chapter and verse 59 he says and he said unto another follow me but he said suffer me first to go and bury my father jesus said unto him let the dead bury the dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god amen wow that's quite something in it his own father jesus says i mean he believes it that's the kind of commitment that god is looking for amen you'll drop everything you'll leave everything even your own life also if you're not willing to forsake it to follow me you're not worthy of following me i mean he believes it takes a complete commitment to follow the lord don't try to drag the old thing we're taught in this hour that amen when you come to the message of this hour you got to forget what pentecost taught you you forget about methodist and baptist nominee you're going to forget all about what you always ever thought amen you can't put new wine in that right in old bottles say man it's got to be new bottles put in new wine and so forth and and then you try to drag that stuff in there it'll contaminate it it's not it won't work you got to forget everything that you was ever taught amen especially the things that's wrong because there's so many things that we were taught wrong in our past amen so looking back thinking about looking back there he says to this he let go and preach the gospel and another said also lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the power and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god amen so there are some instances and cases you know amen places where you don't need to look back you don't want to look back you're commanded not to look back amen you know and philippians paul he also said in philippians 3 and verse 12 he says you know uh verse 13 brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind that right and reaching forth unto those things which i which are before amen so paul even he had learned not to look back to the old things and he looked forward amen to what's ahead of him and i believe that's what we do we look what's ahead but you know on the other aspect of things you know on the other side so the other side of the coin of looking back you know we realized that man as a whole amen after the fall amen and this is the thing of it and then after the fall he meant he became a fallen creature he and he was like in a hole and and we're like in a hole even tonight amber this morning we're like in hole and and we're groaning in paul said we're even groaning amen waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god we're you know we're somewhere we're scrolling we're still we want to get back to the place that we once was amen and that was in that place that we had fellowship with god amen the way that adam was before the fall but he makes a statement amen and believe it was god of this evil age or different places he mentions how that amen we are actually going back to eden as hard as we can amen how many looking forward to that amen and you know i'll tell you what i don't know a few people that live out in the country if you get to sit outside in the chair very much or if you get to go outside and you begin to able to see the beautiful clouds you begin to see the birds you hear the birds you see the beautiful sunset you perhaps you see the beautiful clouds around you know amen and begin to long you begin to long for a day that is eternal where the birds will be perfectly singing forever where their trees will be blooming and green forever there'll never be a fall there there'll never be a winter there amen i believe there's a longing amen and you know one of the things as i begin to think about this the lord begin to move on me about this message you know he says it this way he says you know they just come this was under the sixth seal he says they just come through one of those episodes amen brother maguire he says i think he's here now and they caught him downtown without his western clothes on remember how they have these episodes of how they'd have perhaps a day or so amen and everybody would dress western and then they'll go back the old western base isn't that right it may be long to go back to how it used to be in the western days amen he says without his western clothes and they throw him in jail put up a kangaroo court and made him pay for it and then they made him go out and west buy a western outfit i seen the rest of them walking around with guns about about that long hanging on them they just go negative out there they're trying to live in something in the back days gone by the bygone days amen see and then in kentucky he says you're trying to live in the bygone days of the out of the east here get back in the reno valley and so forth you like to go back to the old days there's some things causing that there's something causing that but when it comes to going back to a gospel back to the original people don't want that amen oh my he said when it comes back to the gospel going back that you want something modern then see but it goes to show he says he goes to show there's something in a man something in man amen that wants to go back to the old days amen how many of them have talked about it and i i tried to pull it up he talks about sometimes we'll get 40 we'll get about 50 years old and all of a sudden we'll get a flat top haircut amen we'll get us a convertible car or we'll get that old camaro we used to have or that firebird that we used to have when we're driving around and we'll go to thinking we're young again huh yeah he talks about people wanting to go back because why because those were the good old days amen the good old days you know and it's amazing how that you can go into stores and you look at a people a person certain people amen perhaps my age around and so forth and they'll be playing certain rock and roll or a certain classic uh uh rock or whatever it might be and i can pretty much tell you what time era those people were from because of the music that listened to amen because i don't know about you but that they're you know nowadays you know they do you know you go back to what you what you really liked and what she was raised up under and you know all of that new stuff that come out brother irvin i'll tell you right now you know whenever old michael jackson come out here he looks like a girl he squeals like a girl you know i just didn't have much for that kind of music or sings like a girl you know what all it is this is all of this new stuff that people are into and now i don't even know where it's at now i don't really care to know but it's so far out there no doubt is that right i think after that just comes to mind now they got into rap and all that other stuff you know and and whatnot you know since this is gone to the dog so if he was back when the dogs back then you know it wasn't no good rock and roll was never any good but you can tell people kind of go back to their roots you go back to what they once was because they'd like to be that again they want to be young again isn't that the truth all right so now listen let's yeah he talks about the western how they'd like to go back to the western day they want to go back to something and then you can take people that want to restore cars even i mean those people like to restore cars amen and whenever whatever time era you was you know and whether it was the old nova or whether it was a chevelle or whether it's a 56 chevy you know you know and people were young at that time and you know then they remember that and people actually go and restore things like that because there's something in them amen because they want to be in a place that they have fallen from that's what restoration and really how many knows the whole whole plan of humanity is about restoration it's all about going back sure it is because remember what redemption means he is our redeemer a redeemed means to bring back back to his original state that it once was amen and we were once with god in that right we were once a part of god amen adam throwed us into this hole amen and not a whole earth is groaning to be back again where they once was especially god's children amen they want to be they want to be restored they want to be brought back to what they once were all right brother even makes a statement about in his life story hmm maybe it's in here no right here it is in front of me i thought it was a life story but it's not it's trying to do god's services about it as well but he makes the statement now notice he says the good heavenly father permitted me to walk behind that curtain one day and see it he says talking about how many heard about that soul what it's under looking a past the curtain of time there it was just the same as i was preaching to y'all there they stood souls under the cry under the elder crying how long not just a myth somebody who had intelligence how long see why we feel that now as our age like brother doll is setting here 93 there's something longing for that young man again there's something uh you'd give anything how i would like to brother jack and all the rest of us go back amen he says here into that young manhood he says what do you want to do that for to be young again and run around no sir because we feel that we'd have more time to glorify god amen and this that we love the god that we love so even brother brandon was saying everybody doesn't matter even christians how many believes it that you have a longing i don't you know as you begin to get older and as you begin to use your strengths and this side or the other and amen and i was talking to sister john east and i was asking how she was doing and if her leg is getting a little better and she's about no not really just about the same i says boy it's sure nice when things get a little better you know you don't want to just stay the same and perhaps as the ogre you get you know that he's healed slower isn't that right amen and you wanna hey man you're you you you wanna be young again you wanna have that youth again you wanna be healed you wanna be restored how much a nice it is you know amen and brother venom you're saying you know it doesn't matter who each one of it us of it is amen we want to be that young again there's something pulling there's something longing amen and that something is in there because god has made us he didn't make us to be old he didn't make us to be feeble he didn't make us be broke down because how many knows that one time we were 20 years old we were strong we were like brother bam says you know he took a picture of you then he says and that's about what you're going to be in eternity for eternity he's right about 20 years old because after that you begin amen to fall and to fall and the fall and the fall isn't that right and there's a longing there amen it doesn't matter who it is in the world you'll see people in better maps that we even long to be young again amen because we are we're in a fallen place a fallen state we desire amen even as you might see a car and it's perhaps got rust and it's old and so forth and you see well i remember when that car was shining i remember when i drove that thing boy it had plenty of power and it drove nice and so forth and you might think i'm going to restore that thing amen that's what god feels about you and i hey man god is going to restore us i'm just glad that he's our true restorer he wants to restore and bring us back to what we once was praise be to god hallelujah oh my so that's what he says now dear brother he says i have this message this morning he says there is a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever and he says in there we'll glorify him through the ages and all the ages and he roll why do we feel that because there is a deep calling to the deep amen and as long as there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond to that call or there wouldn't be that call praise the lord praise the lord this morning we think about it how did god meant to it's about the cake worm the caterpillar and then we see that even the first church how many knows even the first church how that uh in the book of acts how they had they had so much of the power of god in their life until peter people would just get in the shadow of peter and be healed i guess it happened with jesus i can't think of an instant right now before they would just get in the shadow i know they touched that movie's garments but they just got in the shadow of peter amen and they'd raise up and praise be to god what kind of power that church had what kind of a power that church was amen and then we read over in revelations you know it wasn't long after amend the book of acts we find in the first church age the ephesus church age he says nevertheless he says i have somewhat against thee because that has left thy first love amen just begin to let down just begin to get oh just begin to get common huh amen begin to let down begin to fade away like everything that we ever know always wants to fade away and now only the holy spirit can restore us only you god can bring us back hallelujah remember therefore from whence thou art fallen [Music] and repent and do the first works amen how many believes that brother man went into great detail he was telling that church he says you know first you got to go back in your mind of where you fell from amen and then in action begin to go back to the place that you fell from that church age you begin to fall and they begin to fall down through their dark ages and that can't get worm it just begin to eat a way of first their first love was gone then the next time they began to get a little bitter isn't that right they got him bitter they got mirror in their lives they got embalming fluid and then they went into death amen all the way down through those dark ages until we're utterly in other darkness but the spirit said i will restore hallelujah how is that that the holy ghost is in the restoring business oh my i'm so glad for that that he restores like david said my soul amen praise the lord how many believes that and it happens to people a lot of times it happens to christians it happens to churches that you begin amen to fall you begin to get away from prayer you begin to get away from that fire that once burned amen that love that you had for everybody out there one time it begins to fade away and you're in need of a restoration praise the lord let me tell you something i believe that god is restoring the church remember this malachi says he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so even in malachi 4 the message of the hour is a restoration message for giving us back to what we once was so what the church one was what people once was with god this morning maybe well come right down home you maybe you have to ask yourself where you as your closest to the lord where was your closest to the lord and if you can't say that you're closer than you was you're in your closest back then then you're not as close to god as what you should be because you're going backwards not forwards maybe we need to go forward not backwards that's right so do you need a restoration if you're not just on fire ever what remember you need a restoration this morning you need to go back how many ways you need to go back to what you was as a question as to what you once was praise the lord i believe god can do it don't you absolutely praise the lord i believe there's a process how many of those there's a pro process that comes with restoration amen a process that comes with it god has to do a work whenever they take something and they begin to work on it amen they begin to do the saturn the other and how many knows that whenever god created the earth and amen and man fell in the garden of eden god already knew that he was going to flood the earth with water why didn't he burn it with fire he could have done it but no god knew that this earth needed a process of restoration and that press that process was that he was going to have to baptize it with water he's going to have to wash it by the water of the word and that right he's going to have to baptize it and he baptized the earth amen with water at that time and it was the first stage of the process was to wash it clean it up amen and then what was the next process the next stage of restoration just like he does the end of it how they believe that god's got to pick you up amen he's got to call you amen that's the first process is to call you amen to get you in this process of restoration amen to pick you up to wash it you up there's a cup in there right you pick the cup up next thing you begin to clean it the next process was the blood of jesus christ amen the very blood of god dropped upon the earth at calvary all of his blood came out and i'll tell you what how many believes that there was a redeeming work being done to this very planet that we stand on the very earth that we stand on hello and that has two meanings one meaning is this literal earth was sanctified isn't that right this literal earth was sanctified at that time the second meaning is is that you as an individual are married out of dirt it means this piece of earth also was sanctified through the blood how do you believe that that's why i didn't mean that this was done when you go through the process of the new birth amen you go by the way of the water you go by the way of the blood you can't not get sanctified without the blood of jesus christ dropping upon your heart amen and then you get all of those desires those things go by the wayside you become a pure vessel you become a clean vessel god forgives you of all your sins when the blood dropped on that cross amen on the earth all men sins were forgiven whosoever will let him come isn't that right and then that process came and he began to do a work praise be the god amen but from there it isn't enough to pick a cup up it isn't enough just to clean a cup out amen and get it sparkly clean how many knows there's another process that has to happen and that process is there has become a filling of that cup there has become a fiery baptism in other words the holy spirit has to come down there is something let's just admit it there is something special that has to happen if you are ever going to have the ability to be able to call yourself a christian because without that pillow fire without that personal experience feather man says you ain't fit to call yourself a christian you ain't fit to be behind the ball but you ain't seen the cake communion you ain't seen to call yourself a christian unless that baptism has taken place hallelujah how many know this world is in for a fire baptism unlike you have ever seen or can ever imagine it's gonna burn until the very elements shall melt with fervent heat the heavens are gonna be on fire the earth is gonna be on fire and god's gonna expand this thing i believe he said he's going to just bring it into ashes [Music] new law will spew far from the center of the earth amen and when we come back friends for the new heavens and the new earth i'm killing you right now amen in the millennium we're going to walk out on the ashes of the wicked and it's going to be an eden unlike you have ever imagined praise be to almighty god you used to be out there in the world amen you used to live in sin and debauchery and misery and every devil could make its abode in your heart but after the baptism of the holy ghost comes in he washes all them devils out he burns every german every sister out of your heart hallelujah it becomes a new place amen and you can leap for joy amen if you had wings you'd fly why because there is such a peace there is such a joy there's such newness of life a new creature a new creature honey believes it's a process god takes us through that process and if we don't go through that whole process amen we're still somewhere stuck in the middle in the middle of restoration amen praise be to god you love him this morning [Applause] how many needs more of that fire say hey lord i need more of that fire you need more of that than anything else in this world you need more of that fire how do you get that fire but how much you get rid of your old self leave your old self your old thinking your whole ways behind say i'm coming to follow you i ain't worried about what i got to do here my lord i'm just coming completely so you can do a work of restoration for me and that person has to be restored i mean it's in our hearts in the lives of each and every one amen we are to earnestly earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints how many believe that that but i truly believe that malachi 4 that word is not going to return void it's going to accomplish what god said it was going to do it's going to take people back to the very faith that peter and paul and jesus and all of the disciples all that they had i believe it's going to bring a people to that place it's going to restore sooner or later it's going to happen amen and just as we can get ourselves out of the way and that we can die to ourself that faith can come in let me tell you something you won't get any more of god until you make more room for god how many believes you've got to make room for god god's got to have a little bit of room he's got to have some time he's got to have so you have your mind he's got to have your heart he's got to have your thinking but no we're thinking about everything else all the time no wonder god can't do nothing for us no wonder he can't bring a stimulation revelation bring our blind by lord bring our minds back and and then bring it back to the original place that we once had amen the joy that we once had the fire that we once had amen god is still doing it he's still in the business this morning god is going to bring it back if you're a child of god you're going to be in the restoring process amen oh we pray we pray lord give me this and give me the lord make life easy and god says man that's just the opposite of what i'm gonna give you we always want things easy when once he's comfortable and god's in the business of making things hard sometimes for us making things rough because he wants to see how we do when things not going so good see if we really have the faith because that is the goal that god wants to live with trials temptations hardships different things come our way because god's want to live with somebody that wants to love him and will serve him no matter what not just the good times but in the bad times not unjust the good things of life but in the bad things of life why do you think he let it get that way amen praise be to god i know about you but i'm going to be one happy camper when we get to the other side and there is no more trial there's no more tests there is no more sickness there is no more sorrow there is no more good days and bad days there's no ups and there's no downs there's no old age and no gray hair no getting feeble no sickness no coronavirus huh i was just thinking the other day isn't it gonna be nice when we can say hey the coroner's past man huh are we all gonna be glad things are a little bit back to normal a little bit now we know things are never going to be completely normal because this this this world's going downhill really really fast so i don't think it's going to go backwards so it's going to keep going getting worse we have thus saith the lord you watch you'll get worse and worse until the skies catch on fire is that right that's right but i'm looking forward to it i don't know about you but i'm looking forward to it when the lord amen restores the earth the bible that says one day you know the lord will come and he'll she'll bring these kingdoms amen and crush them the stone that was shown out of the mountain that says amen which is christ amen will come and he'll crush these nations to powder there's nothing left going to be left for ashes of these nations and then the bible says i'll give glory to god people for the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdom of our god and our savior and our lord how many believe god's going to restore this world the earth just as he has redeemed how many believe that redemption except for the physical body i believe that we are redeemed back to god according to the prophet of god amazing with me sure brother baby said it man has been redeemed we have the same rights as adam did now except we still have this carnal flesh that has to be dealt with amen god has done a redemptive work he has restored us if you're filled with the holy ghost this morning amen and god's going to do it to this world god's going to take it to this take this earth through the process of cleaning it up changing it purifying it just like he does you and i how many thankful for the work that god does in your life amen he has a way of catching our attention don't he sure he does praise be to god going home i'm just looking forward to going home being restored back to our home where we once was amen we sing that song going home i'm going home amen never more to rome if you're a sinner this morning what does that mean amen that means that the holy spirit is calling amen and you have been away from father for so long and that spirit begins to call come home son come home where are you son where are you amen and something in the inside begins to say i want to go home i want to be home again i'm not in my right place i'm not supposed to drink and party and live in the world that's not my place there's something else for me there's a better place and you begin to call and god calls you home to himself comes you back brings you back to the holy spirit getting us ready to take us home to our eternal home i believe as we come down towards the end of the world as we come down to where this is certainly needing a complete restoration and we feel it calling us we feel it calling us i hope you feel that call because i sure do i feel that call that god is coming close now he's gonna cook it's close to bring us back to himself to be united with him through all of eternity brother banham in life story he says this how many people here is away from home let's see he says this is not your native home he says let's see your hand you're from another city perhaps somewhere else oh my half of us more than half of us is away from home no matter what city we're from or where we come from it's just a little different as the minister said the other day the little church in the desert that he was pastoring no matter what it is or how humble it is like the old proverb says the old song says there's no place like home hey amen no place like home but martha they do a bit of world traveling they could probably tell us you know it's wonderful to see the world but no place like home right ah we're home again ah my bed my bedroom my kitchen huh isn't that what we do when we go on vacation sometimes and oh it's wonderful and it's great but still there's no place like home amen and folks i'm here to tell you if you're a person that strays away from god you may go straight straight away but when you get back to god you can say ah no place like home no place like being right with the lord no place like having his spirit dwelling in me there's just no place amen so brother brown's making a point no place like home he says if you'll notice always before people die you'll notice they're always having a longing to go back to the old home place amen i thought when he said that i said well brother byler you just visited your old home place up there but i don't hope that i'm fixing live just yet but some time though sometimes it was like 20 years before i seen the old home place where i was raised you know and i we drove up in there i remember me and my wife we took my vehicle and went up in there and it was my first cousin then her husband that were there and they weren't that much older than me but they were already retired and in a mommy daughter house if you know what that is it's a grandma grandpa house you know they're on a little side house there beside ours and i guess their children were in the main house where i live now i'm like wow time does go on don't it my first cousin's already retired and so forth you know one you begin to look around and you see what used to be precious memory and that right how many has precious memories and every one of us has those don't we the place that we were raised our neighbors that we visited i went and visited several of my neighbors while i was up there and how surprising it was to see him again how surprised they were to see me after many years but he says before they die they'll go and see the whole place again my father before he left he hadn't been down to his old home place for many years many many years some 25 years i guess i seen him sitting on the beam of the plow one day he was crying and i was just a little laugh and i didn't know very much about it and i said what's the matter dad he come over and he said you don't understand billy but someday you will he says i want to go home i want to see the old home place again you know it wasn't but a little bit after he visited the old home he went away he went up there he'd come back and he was crying and i was okay this is brother frank okay this is father brother brother brahms father-in-law he's speaking of now he went up there he come back from his old home place and he was crying and i was going with his daughter and i said what's the matter brother frank he said billy i set up on the old place up there today and he says where the old house used to stand said the old spring along over there on the side of the hill said you could just hear my old mother say oh frankie well just a few days i buried him maybe it was a call coming from another land he could hear the echoes from across the earth i went to a man some time ago killed in an accident he was just dying come out of the accident like manner and i've seen many of them going that way not just wonder he says that if when we're coming even death is hard jesus fought against it if it be possible let this cup pass but when we're coming down right down to the end of the road and i've watched my wife as she went out and i wonder when we get to the end of the road if god doesn't just say to mother or for some of them on the other side look daughter's coming home this morning go down there by the bank of the river and watch for them get to see them when their these eyes become trans becoming transformed from the natural to the supernatural amen in that vision when it's catching on us it's a fog that just dries away there and we can look to the other side and see them coming down the river amen i'll tell you this i truly believe that when brother ivan was going i remember when he was going to further and i caught his attention one time when he was just about gone and i said jesus loves you and he jerked his head back like like he was coming out of the other world and realizing that you're still partially here or something i'd believe that i believe that when they get down to that door they can actually begin to see you on the other side they begin to see home homes called amen he says brother brown he said he's seen many of people come to down that place and begin to speak i don't think i have the next page but he took i don't think he was here but he says listen catching us it's a fog that's there we can look on the other side see them coming down to the river i hope that's so i don't know i can't say for sure at all but i've seen many times when our loved ones pass on it goes that way i was listening to brother branham and he was talking about uh how that he just couldn't bear it anymore when his wife passed and media i mean hope passed and sharon rose and he had grabbed was going to try to grab a hold of that hot wire with all of that amps on it and so forth and he was reaching for it and he says he found himself down on the ground crying and so forth and he says that was just god protecting his gift how he got down there i don't know but got an angel mowed down grabbed him and laid him down there what for you and me so we could receive the message of the hour so we could be restored back to the faith of the fathers amen and then he said he went home and he just still couldn't bear in the old cold room you know and uh and tried to shoot we wouldn't shoot he wouldn't shoot he says god you won't even let me die threw the gun down there and it went off you know and he says he fell asleep and when he fell asleep he said he don't know just what it was but he's seen sharon he's seen a young lady by an old schooner wagon schooner i believe this wheel was broken or something over there and he seen his daughter there and she was asking where billy paul is you know and uh she was 20 years old and she says dad how you doing dad you know and brother billy says you how how what do you call me dad you know i don't have a daughter this age he says you don't understand we aren't little babies over here you know we're full grown when we come over here and she says you know mama's waiting for you mom's waiting for you up at the house up there and he looked up there in the old mansion up there up there to your house and brother brown says brandon's gonna have homes the vagabonds and it was a real hard time for him but you know he went up there he said he went up the steps went up the steps to this house opened the door and there was hope standing there you know and welcomed him in and talked to him talked to him a little bit and said you know promise me he said she you know and anyway he seen the chair over there in the other room remember that he seen the chair and and uh you know and hope says you know over here he told the story of how they had come and taken his chair because he couldn't afford that dollar a week and they took his chair and she said there's your chair you know they won't come and take this one it's paid for he seen that place over there and anyway he was in his sleep or whatever it was hope keep telling them you know that you have got to quit worrying about us she said we're in a better place than you are how many of these our loved ones are loved ones that are christians they're in a better place than we are much better place there's no tb over there there's no pneumonia there's no things that's going to kill you over there you just perfect life perfect 20 years old perfect health nothing ever like we have to face here amen amen i think about think about that how many believes that's what we're going back to and anyway so hope kept saying that you know and he went over there he seen the chair and so forth and kept talking to me i just can't do without you and so forth well promise me you won't worry anymore promise me you won't worry anymore and he says i just can't promise that and directly he woke up he said there he was in the rooms all dark and she had put his her arm around him you remember and she was patting him i don't know just somehow around there patting him you know on his back and she had her honor around him and so forth but she woke up and there and all of a sudden he still felt that pat still fed her felt that patent now what about that promise what about that promise you won't worry anymore you won't fret anymore how many believes the lord jesus actually because of what he was going through was comforting his prophet he allowed that to happen for that dimension to come into this dimension just far enough to give him comfort and let him know we're all right keep pressing the battle keep pressing the battle amen and that's what brother ram said he was doing but anyway so she was patting him on the back and not only did he feel the pad of her hand on him but he heard her voice saying you know now what about that promise but you won't worry what about that promise he says all right okay i promise i won't worry anymore and she patted him a few more times and there she was calling and you know he turned on the light and everything looked around but she was gone but there's a land beyond the river folks that we call a sweet forever amen that i believe all of us is longing to see one of these days there is somebody believe this is a real place heaven's a real place folks and so is hell hell is a real place judgment's going to be real god is real and he's bringing his people back to himself getting us ready to completely restore us back to where they were supposed to be before this ball started rolling and i don't know about you but i'm looking forward to going to that eden where there's no old age there's no death there's no sickness there's no sorrow no battles how many is with me this morning god bless you stand with me this morning let's go before the lord in prayer musicians if you want to come going home going home there is nothing to hold me here amen kind of homesick for a country to where i've never been before how many believes there's something calling in our hearts saying this world is not my home here we have no continuing city folks amen but we seek one to come we seek a body that will never get old that will never die in a country that is forever and that is just beyond this veil here lord jesus as we bow our heads father we pray god if there's one person in here this morning that needs a closer walk with you may they raise your hand and say god i need a closer walk with you father lord restore my joy again restore me back to you father god bless those hands god bless you god bless you now lord jesus you know why you laid that on my heart father because you knew people that needed a closer walk with you father and i i pray god that after today they would become more homesick and say god this is just not my home this world is not my home this is a pest house down here it's satan's eden and a pest house what a horrible place to have to be but lord jesus we thank you for the comfort of your spirit and for your word god gives us comfort through this journey lord that whether we live or whether we die we are yours and we don't have to fear anything not even death we ask god that you'd help us lord to get ready father lord to meet our loved ones to meet that land and to come into that home that you have prepared for us you said i go to prepare a place for you that where i am there you may be also and lord we look forward to today god that when you'll restore us all the way back to eden again father and we'll have that fellowship with you we'll be able to walk up and down in the cool of the day lord enjoy all the blessings lord you bestowed upon us never

prepare them lord to go home to be with you to restore us back to yourself father and lord will come up there to be with you for about three and a half years or so father while you make this world and this earth once again you bring the fiery baptism upon it and you restore it back to the way it was supposed to be before the sin got this ball of rolling in the wrong way and all sin and admired admired us up father you'll make it right you'll restore it father we thank you lord jesus for the restoration that you have done in our each one of our lives and we pray god this morning if there's a young person an older person a middle-aged person that has not been restored to you and doesn't know you in a personal way father that you would give him the real experience of the baptism of the holy ghost lord and that they would be restored back to god the way that they were supposed to be father we love you lord jesus and we commit ourselves to you now in jesus name amen and amen god bless you
