[0:00] Amen. We want to remember Charlie Kirk
[0:03] and their family this morning. Amen. We
[0:06] uh
[0:07] know enough about him that that uh he
[0:11] went right in the face of the devil.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; I mean, he faced the devil down. So much
[0:18] so that he'd have to wear a bulletproof
[0:20] vest. Ain't that right?
[0:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because of the threats. Ain't that
[0:24] right? So, he wasn't afraid to get right
[0:26] out there and try to help them young
[0:28] people. That's right.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; Try to tell them the truth.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So, I have a lot of
[0:32] respect for the man.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're certainly living in
[0:36] Bible days. Yeah. Isn't that right?
[0:38] Where evil tries to destroy good.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. And so, from what I
[0:44] understand, the man was living with a a
[0:46] trans partner.
[0:49] So, that tells you much a whole lot
[0:50] about the trans person. Isn't that
[0:53] right? Or homosexual.
[0:56] If they'll do that, folks, if a man will
[0:58] live with a man or something like it,
[1:00] they'll do just about anything. I'll say
[1:02] this from the pulpit, they have no
[1:04] morality. You got no morality. Zero. I
[1:09] wouldn't trust you more than nothing.
[1:11] That's right. It's sad.
[1:15] But we do pray for the man that did it.
[1:17] We pray that God will bring conviction
[1:18] on him. Isn't that right? We pray for
[1:20] him. We pray that God will save his
[1:22] soul. That's right. Perhaps you'll see
[1:24] that this man was willing to give his
[1:26] life for what he believed. When you do
[1:28] that, you've got something worthwhile
[1:31] &gt;&gt; because I highly doubt he's got
[1:32] something worth giving his life for.
[1:34] Amen. So, we pray for him. We pray God
[1:37] save his soul. Is that right?
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Have mercy on him. Amen. But what he did
[1:42] was terrible. And so, we want to just
[1:45] think about in a modern age in our own
[1:47] country where a Christian because he's a
[1:50] Christian and stands for Christ, they
[1:52] took his life. Amen. So they have killed
[1:56] him, martyed him because of that.
[1:57] Because of that. Amen. Because of his
[1:59] stands against these type of lifestyles
[2:03] and simply just telling the truth.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Nowadays, telling the truth
[2:10] can get you killed. Ain't that right?
[2:12] But that's okay. We're going to tell the
[2:14] truth anyway. I I don't care who hears
[2:15] it. I don't care if you like it or not.
[2:17] It's the truth, and we're going to stand
[2:18] for it.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. We don't we don't give one
[2:21] bit one nothing one little care whether
[2:23] you don't like it.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; It's still the truth. It's always going
[2:26] to be the truth.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; And it ain't going to change. We ain't
[2:29] going to change for people's opinion. Is
[2:31] &gt;&gt; that right?
[2:32] &gt;&gt; We don't change for nobody. Amen. We
[2:35] stand with the Lord if it cost us our
[2:37] lives.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; We would much rather die. Hello. Than to
[2:42] give in to such scum and such such
[2:45] falseeness.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And such perversion. Ain't that
[2:50] right?
[2:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. No way we would ever want
[2:52] to uh taint our souls with such things.
[2:57] Amen. And it shows where the world is.
[2:59] So, let's have a moment of silence to
[3:02] remember
[3:03] Charlie Kirk.
[3:17] Lord Jesus, this morning we also
[3:18] remember his wife, his children, his
[3:21] family, Lord, that
[3:24] have to separate from him and suffer the
[3:27] loss and feel that emptiness and have to
[3:29] go through that, Lord. And we do pray
[3:31] for comfort for them, Lord, that they
[3:34] could believe that Charlie's over in
[3:35] heaven knowing he's given his life for
[3:38] the gospel and for the cause of Christ.
[3:40] And we just pray for them in a special
[3:42] way that you'll bring comfort to that
[3:43] family now in Jesus name. Amen. And
[3:46] amen.
