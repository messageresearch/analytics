[Music] you said don't believe it has done you said I believe you said [Music] We Believe [Music] can we believe [Music] so I just uh I just recently um heard this song and uh it really it really showed a lot with it and um it's all about when the devil just completely tries to make you feel so down about yourself and you start overthinking and you feel like nobody's there when truly his when God is there for you and um I uh I found a scripture before I started um before I got up here and I it's from Luke 15 18 to 24 and the 24th versus for my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be married and it just shows just how merciful god truly is and this song kind of reminded me of that [Music] thank you have you ever felt like nobody was there have you ever felt forgotten in the middle of nowhere you ever felt like you could disappear like you could fall no one would hear to let the lonely feeling wash away maybe there's a reason to believe you'll be okay cause when you don't feel strong enough to stand you can reach reach out on your head and told someone will come running and I know they'll take you home even when the darkness crashing through when you need a friend to carry you when you're broken off the ground you will be found to let the sun come streaming in cause you'll reach up and you'll rise again yeah you will be found there's a place where we don't have to feel unknown and every time [Music] [Applause] [Music] across the silence your voice is [Music] [Music] you will be found so let the sun come stream your eyes again lift your head and look around don't you will be found you will be fine [Music] [Music] is now it's filling up the empty and suddenly I see that everything is known even when the dark comes crashing through when you need a friend to carry you when you're broken on the ground you will be found so let the sun come streaming and show reach up in your eyes again [Applause] on you will be fine [Music] you will be fine [Applause] amen praise the Lord how many is looking forward to the word now amen stand with me tonight let's just expect tonight and pull everybody pull him along the gift of God they meant to come out and preach for us hopefully everybody's not as tired as I am amen I was up on the roof hot roof metal screwing metal down today so amen but I feel pretty good so hopefully everybody's awake and ready amen let's just sing Amazing Grace is our brother Danny comes tonight or amen Amazing Grace [Applause] [Music] uh like me [Music] [Music] it was Grace [Music] in Grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] all operations [Music] God praise God and praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God [Music] praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God and praise God amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight hope everyone's doing all right I counted a in honor and privilege to be here tonight and tonight what I want to speak on is the Battle of surrender see because because um the world wants you to conform to it World once II to have our surrender the devil wants us to Bow before him a one once he has the the world and in the in his his grasp through everything and right now uh we we're seeing literal devil worship uh everywhere in in Brazil that remember when on the news we've seen how they were how that maybe it was on the news but I seen that that they were all worshiping the devil and they were they were blaspheming the name of Lord Jesus Christ they they had this whole devil festival and then the very next day they had the wrath of God come on them and they had a bunch of uh floods I believe in that and it was in that very next day but the devil wants us to surrender to him that's why he also asked Jesus he told Jesus I would give you all of this if you would just bow before me surrender to me because there's a battle going on in the spiritual realm of a battle of surrender because uh as the Lord wants us to surrender into him but the devil also wants our surrender and every time we choose the things of the world over God we're surrendering into the devil when we when we surrender to God when that's obedience to God's word when we obey God's word we focus on God we choose to do that instead of going out into the world instead of instead of looking to these other things that that the devil wants us to surrender to we surrender it to God powerful things can happen man let's turn to Romans 12 in and verse 1. Romans 12. it says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and and um I have another scripture to turn to turn to uh Rome's I mean excuse me Rome I don't know I said that but James for James 4 and we'll start with verse seven I don't know where I got Rome's from anyways I'm sounding like Joe Biden my therapist for a second anyways James 4 verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to God and He will draw an eye to you clean cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded and go go to verse 10 humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up may God well actually let's pray let's pray Lord God we can't um humbly before you Lord with with with our hearts Wide Open Lord to surrender unto you to to surrender to your will Lord I I just pray tonight Lord that you come and take control of our hearts so let us not surrender to the things of the world let let us not conform to this world but but seek you to seek you to seek your will for our lives Lord to not be so caught up with the things of this world the things that are going on but but to focus on you above everything else to put you first Lord tonight I pray that you'll come in a powerful way tonight Lord and speak to a heart sword help us Lord to grow closer to you Lord for that is our desire Lord that we may be closer to you in a closer walk with you Lord we aim for Perfection Lord but but [Music] Lord help us to be as close as we can to that place we didn't know it and we can't exactly get to the place of perfection but Lord help us to grow closer to perfection closer to to becoming Your Perfect Bride your perfect spotless bride that you have called us to be Lord in your perfect will Lord tonight help us Lord to surrender our more Lord Lord we we may already have our hearts surrendered to you Lord but help us to surrender a little bit more a little bit more tonight Lord may we surrender or whatever part it might be of Our Lives Lord surrender everything to you Lord not just a part of our Lives not just the this part and this part and this part but everything Lord help us to surrender everything to you Lord tonight I pray in Jesus name amen amen surrendering excuse me you can be seated surrendering all is laying everything down at the feet of Jesus and committing everything to him it's giving up and letting him take control surrendering it to him is that is the best way to overcome anything regardless of what it is that we're going through if we're if we're going through different issues different problems in our lives and and we're worrying about it stressing over it and thinking how can I overcome this how can I I overcome it if we can just get to the place where we lay it before Christ and we say God I'm committing this to you I'm putting this at your feet I'm surrendering it to you now Lord and not not just the place where you say I surrender it and then you end the rest of the day you're thinking about and worrying about it and and being doubtful about it and thinking well maybe you might not maybe he might but if we get to the place where we're at peace and and we can just say God's in control I'm not going to worry about it I'm just gonna put in his hands he's going to take care of it he's going to come through because innocent that's the way we can tap into that spiritual sense of faith is surrendering to God you've got to surrender soul body you gotta surrender soul body Spirit strength everything you are to the will of God becoming a prisoner to him you're going to be somebody's prison and you don't belong to yourself you are are somebody's prisoner you're either a prisoner of the devil knowing this truth and won't surrender to it or a prisoner to the world and Sur and surrender surrender to God one or the other you're either the devil's prisoner to sin or Europe God's prisoner to righteousness you're one or the other amen and he says as uh here in um a super sense this is a good one but but that same sense God spoke when there was nothing what is that sense that super sense is God the faith of God in you the part of God that that comes unto you who gives you the super sense by that same super sense God frame the world together with things which was not and did not appear he spoke his word and believed his word and in a world shook into into existence The Sixth Sense the the super sense oh oh God pouring it out on me give it to me and everyone who needs it poor thy Sixth Sense and and to me Lord I am willing to surrender these five my own knowledge thoughts casting down all reasonings or let Thy word be true and every man's a lie every reasoning every doubt be Cast Away and let me walk in the super sense the sense of the Holy Spirit he says don't you want that that's the thing that we want God God bless you friends that's what you need that super sense will I will ask for something and it knows that he will give it it's persuaded for for he that cometh the God must believe that he is in a rewarder of those that diligently seek him if the sixth sense says God keeps his word I give myself to him I surrender all I got to I got to to him my my sense says that and this will bring it to pass my faith and God's word then then call anything else contrary to it as though it wasn't Abraham met God and God said you're going to have a baby by Sarah and him 20 75 not 25 and his and her 65 Abraham and called everything that wasn't that was contrary to that as though it wasn't he walked as if he seen God and he believed amen and this kind of Faith the Abraham surrendered his own doubts is it of course Abraham had doubts of course Abraham had had fears in thinking what and how can this be hey how how is it possible but he surrendered it to God he didn't he didn't and feed the aid that I think if that thing that those thoughts that went in his mind which we all have them he let them go away he said I don't care God said it that sells it I believe it I don't care what anybody else says I don't care what my own wife says I'm gonna believe it I'm going to trust that that God's gonna take care of it no matter what because I am surrendering it to God I'm saying surrendering it to him and I know that he's going to take care of it because why he said so and I'm gonna believe it Abraham a man who who waited patiently for the Fulfillment uh this is if he waited patiently for his son Isaac God told Abraham to sacrifice his only son Isaac his only son and he went up the mountain and and and and and and and I and uh his son asked him why are you taking me here where's the why are you taking me up here without a sacrifice and Abraham known that God what God had told him and had responded with God's going to provide the sacrifice I don't I don't care how absurd this sounds to everybody else I'm not even I didn't he didn't even tell his own wife he didn't tell his own wife because he knew what her reaction would be you're taking my only son to be sacrificed there's no way God told you to do that he wouldn't do that and we would all think the same thing if God ever told someone to do this in his life in these days especially God telling God promised you a son and God's going to take him up there and sacrifice your only son kill your own you're gonna kill your only son upon that mountain and he said I don't care God told me to do it I'm gonna go up there and do exactly what he said and I believe that that because he said he and he was going to uh he was going to to um give me a so many a um children by him so so many grandchildren grandchildren grandchildren and it had to be through him God's Gonna raise him back to life or he's going to do something and I'm going to trust him no matter what even when I don't understand it [Music] even when I don't understand I'm going to trust in God I'm gonna I'm I'm gonna do exactly what he told me to do regardless of what anybody says about it I don't care what anybody else thinks how crazy it looks and and his own son knew to trust in his father he went with it he didn't try to run away he didn't try this essay hey oh but but let's go back let's go get a lamb just in case maybe he he was going to bring a lamb along with it and I was going to sacrifice no he trusted his father and Abraham trusted his heavenly father that everything was gonna uh work out for the good because God always comes through and even in this time he's going to come through amen he didn't have to worry he didn't have to he didn't have to he didn't have to think about about how and what is God gonna do this he didn't and try to explain it to himself he just trusted God completely because he was fully surrendered to God he fully surrendered his will not my will but your will be done I'm gonna do exactly what he and called me to do and and as they started climbing up this mountain and and and I can imagine him am scared both of them both of them scared for aired because they both knew that that they might not see each other again and because uh because he was going to do exactly what God told him to do he didn't he didn't care about his own thoughts his own feelings how he he felt about it he was he was going up there practically mourning in his own son because because he knew what was going to happen he knew what he had to do but he had to still keep going he had to push past those feelings because we can't rely on our own feelings and our flesh when we have to rely on on what where God is leading us not how our feelings are leading us because our feelings can go over the place and if he simply went by his feelings he would have not followed through with God what God had called him to do to the top of the mountain and and his son's looking at him and and he told him get get on upon that that rock he now that this will make you just bolted away ran away I'm not gonna do that I'm not gonna get on there we've gone too far where's the sacrifice at where is it I don't see any sacrifice but he he he I believe he just calmly went and my dad said to do this I'm going to follow through exactly what he said to do I'm gonna Trust question him I'm gonna trust in God God knows what he's doing I'm gonna get upon this altar I'm gonna sacrifice myself now I don't think that that Abraham had to tie him down does it say he had the time down I don't think it does because if if we we have I don't have this scripture I don't think he had to tie him down I don't remember remember reading once that he had to tie his own son down he gladly got up there upon upon that altar with all the wood and everything around it go up on that altar as his as sacrifice because he trusted it in in his father and and he's interested in his heavenly father as well because he knew that his father was following God's commands because he knew that that God had called his father or to be who he is and called him to go up there upon that rock to be a sacrifice and so he was sacrificing himself thinking I'm gonna I'm on this altar as a sacrifice to God I'm not up here because my father decided it it to be crazy one day he didn't and I think he didn't see his father as going insane because that's how everyone putty would have looked at it you're insane Abraham why are you doing this you seem like some kind of crazy hey mentally ill person you could have imagined anybody that would have knew about what he was doing people watching him go along without without a sacrifice what where's the sacrifice that Abraham God's Gonna provide it going up there in there God's Gonna provide the sacrifice and and he's up there he's uh he's on that altar he's saying taking within himself I'm I'm about to die but this is a worldly cause this is a sacrifice as he watched the knife go over him thinking and here it is that's it I'm a sacrifice to God I I'm sacrificing myself to God because that's what God told my father to do and I'm gonna trust him I'm gonna even though I'm gonna die right now he fell in his heart because it was way too close for him to question whether he was going to die or not with a knife over him and without him even being tied down you're even pulling that up brother piler you can't find it where it says he they didn't tie him down did he I see pictures of him uh on a book of him being tied down I don't think he was tied down though all right but but he offered himself because he see he could have still ran away I don't think he was they also show him on pictures of him being tied with his hands like this uh himself he was trusting yeah okay I I don't ever remember reading that he was tied up though I believe he he offered himself as that sacrifice as well because he trusted and and and just as he was about to to kill him just as he was about to sacrifice his son and then the angel of the Lord Eric came and spoke and said said don't kill your son I the Lord has provided a sacrifice amen but this was an example of what God was going to do thousands of years I believe and later that that Jesus Christ was going to die upon that cross but this time it was gonna he was gonna fall through with it completely and and the Lord Jesus Christ offered himself as a sacrifice for our sins upon that cross as a Living Sacrifice willingly and and and he he said he said and uh not my will Lord but yours be done not my way uh Lord God but yeah yours be done he surrendered himself before the almighty that was that was as God manifested In the Flesh but we we know that that according to what brother Branham said he was a tabernacle and and that flesh didn't want to die upon that cross that flesh didn't want to die upon the cross because he had to suffer he had he had to suffer so um so much on that cross as as the The Living Sacrifice as an example to it to us all that we we should pick up our crosses and follow him and surrender ourselves before him that we may be a Living Sacrifice before the Lord Jesus Christ that we might follow him and follow his way and his guidance just like that rich the Rich Young Ruler Jesus asked him to surrender everything get rid of everything sell everything you have and come unto me and pick up your cross and follow me and the burden was too hard to Bear he couldn't surrender himself even though the the Lord loved that Mandela and Jesus said yes love love that man and he loved his sincerity asking how can I enter into the Kingdom of Heaven because he knew he lacked something he knew there was something that was missing and that was that that sacrifice that commitment and and following Christ that's what what he was missing he he had to not just follow them with the all the Commandments and everything he had to become a Living Sacrifice and follow the lord Jesus Christ and take up his cross and follow him says this and didn't you ever see see a man that had been stricken by an evil spirit like that he is several times his strength this is what it means to surrender to an evil spirit several times his strength how I have noticed them in the meetings when groups of police couldn't even hold them they they would tear them and then police the pieces and throw them aside and and throw them inside and get in and get them out and and and and just create chaos and everything around around the entire building because they were had an evil spirit but brother Branham says how much more so we have if we surrender until Lord Jesus Christ how much more power we can get if we surrender unto God because because that is just that those are Fallen Angels how much more or can the power of God come on upon a person that is fully surrendered unto God how much more can they have how much more power that God will give us over them the evil spirits and that they have the Superhuman strength that can then probably lift this Pulpit out I remember um just to explain how heavy this Pulpit is remember when we moved in when there was a baptism it's so heavy you can't hardly lift it and and they could just lift it up probably over their head and toss it across the room like that so much power strength but we can and just say a few words and they have so much fear of the believer so much fear of of those that are surrendered unto God is so much fear of us that yet they are so powerful the the power of God is stronger than that every every single oh devil has to Bow before that a son or daughter of God they have to bow before us and they have to to surrender into us all of our our enemies will bow before us that that's my they have to they have to say surrendered to us is because those evil spirits how much more can the believer have when he surrenders unto God foreign surrendered to the evil one it took possession of him and he had not his own understanding he only did what the evil spirit put in him to do that's what what's fully surrendering to that evil spirit is doing that's what they they're they do and right now there's a lot of people in the insane asylum there's a lot of people out on the streets that are demon-possessed but they haven't fully surrendered to that because when they do that it takes over and it controls and they and and you you'll sometimes see that happen when you make one one of them angry you know they'll start to allow that that able Spirit to come upon them more and they'll they'll some sometimes attack you sometimes sometimes they'll they'll restrain themselves and just yell at you or scream out I've seen in videos of them just screaming on the streets they just screed super loud and and you seem loan to them well wouldn't they said when Donald Trump got in a bunch of them started screaming on the street started is crying out like crazy and said the the leftists and and all that that I won't go to too deep into that is evil spirits in them that's making them do that as evil spirits in in them that's making them them act the way they are they they call it Mental Illness but really it's just a demonic spirit that gets upon them now now he continues then then I thought with a complete surrender to the devil can give a man maybe five times his strength what would a complete surrender to God do to a man what would it do to it to a that's a weak and body and can't walk or something if we could just completely yield to the Holy Ghost give us super strength to rise in the in the name because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world see you the strength of God that's in you is greater than any Affliction that can come upon you there is nothing can overtake take you you can suit it that can supersede you because you are full of super power and that superpowers the holy spirit that dominates your life if you are a Christian amen fully surrender if we can fully surrender into God on his power will come down in our lives like neg we've never seen before if we can fully surrender into into unto God and then and all only then can the power of God be manifest within us if we can surrender and yield ourselves unto God that that's what what a preacher is supposed to do when he gets up here to yield himself off to God to surrender himself to God that God might come down and speak through him and every demon every devil has to leave in Jesus name because there's no demon no darkness and and hell can't stand against it nothing in hell can stand against the the believer that's been surrendered unto God because God is living within that manifested in the in the flesh and the form of the Holy Spirit and it'll become begin to manifest in your life and your actions and the things that you're doing and if we can sometimes we get to the place where even us that are baptized with the Holy Ghost can get to a place where where where sometimes where we we get so full of ourselves where we're we're we're going on it and and we we begin to have a few things that aren't completely surrendered unto God a few things here a few things there and we begin to to get overcome with the the things going on the the in our lives the things that are happening that can get can just slowly creep in that the devil's always sneaky he always tries to If he if he can't if he can't get us to surrender her to him he's gonna get us to surrender to different things so that makes him innocent he'll try to he'll try to get our attention diverted because the devil is always roaring about like a like a roaring lion not or not a roaring lion he's not a wrong line he's just a bluff an acting like a roaring lion but really he's he's just a bluff he's not as big as a lion he's he's not a lion but he Roars like one he roams about roaring like a lion because he's angry and he's tired of of seeing us Believers acting upon what God has told us to do and and following in God's footsteps he's tired of seeing the power of God being manifested and the Believers because when when the power of God comes down and manifests himself within us if we surrender ourselves fully unto God that that power May flow through Satan sees everything we're doing and he wants to distract us he'll he'll smell he'll snap something in our lives you'll put something in our lives that'll distract us get our minds off of that he'll get our minds off of that and on to that thing that problem that pops up this part the devil's always trying to put sickness and illnesses whatever it is and he'll pop it up in our lives and and we and we'll be oh no how am I going to deal with this I don't know how how am I gonna do this but God cause us to surrender it to him God called us to surrender to him that he may use us because sometimes we we get up in our own selves and we we we get so so so much so particular in in our own ways in doing our own way and doing our own things that we forget to surrender to God surrender it to him that he made it come in a powerful way and heal us and bring us to the place where he wants us to be to his perfect will and use us in a powerful way that his power May flow through us and cast every every devil out and that's where where this first comes on it comes into to my play they shall cast out demons they they shall heal the sick they shall do all these things in my name but what's the first thing thing that God calls us to do surrender to him he wants us to take up our cross and follow him that's the only way these these things can come into manifest into our lives is if we can surrender those things to him and think things will still come up and things will still try to get your attention diver your attention the most distracting thing is this phone um the most or or your TV or or it could just be someone uh you know the times when when you're praying and a notification pops up and the phone starts ringing and because the devil don't like it when you get on your knees and pray the devil don't like it when you're when you're on your knees surrendering everything to God the devil don't like it so we're gonna do it more amen and we get we gotta keep that devil full angry as long as the devil's angry at us and throwing everything and we resist the devil we we he will flee you say I rebuke that devil in Jesus name I'm going to keep on focusing on God I'm going to keep on surrendering to God I don't care what's popping up I don't care what's going on I'm just going to surrender it to God and you'll get that that peace that passes understanding and and you'll have have the power of God moving in your life if you are surrendered unto God amen if we could fully surrender ourselves to God he can he could use us in a in powerful ways but we get so into our own way of doing things that we forget to go to God for guidance we forget to surrender to God and sometimes we we go to God and say hey we surrender but we don't fully mean it because we worry and we think about it and so much instead of just committing it to God and trusting in Him and man I don't I don't think there's one of us that's not guilty of that we're all guilty of that we we say God I surrender to you well maybe it's not supposed to work out the way I thought it was gonna maybe it was it's going to be a little bit different than than I thought it was going to be I don't I don't know I don't know it's what can I do to to to make this different what can I do and where and where we're out here trying to trying to do God's work trying to try trying to to stop it from whatever it is we always try and try our very best to to be in control of everything and when we get to the place where we don't surrender it to God and commit it to him and we we go around uh running around and trying to trying to work everything out ourselves and trying to fix that and trying to fix that and and then and then and um and God just tells us to Just Surrender it to me I'll take care of it just just commit it to me those things that we're not in control of God wants us to surrender it to him because we can't control everything we're human beings we try to control everything we try to say I want to do it this way I want to do it that way and and then we forget to go to God and surrender it to him and say God I commit this to you uh I'm not going to worry about God help me not to worry about because we're human beings we worry about things help me to surrender it to you if we could just surrender it to him tonight surrender everything he'll do it all for you maybe maybe not when or how we imagined or or wanted it but uh but we'll see breakthroughs we didn't even know could happen we'll see healings that we were told that were impossible we'll see chains break that we thought couldn't be broken if we could just surrender again let God take control of it surrender to God it's it's we can't just say I surrendered to God and and and and not say that's end of story We it's a daily thing surrender to God every single day crucify the flesh commit it to God and say God I surrender to you every single day it's not just one day I surrender all to you and the next day and everything's good the next day everything's good every single day it takes surrender we have to surrender every single day if we don't we're gonna be all over the place our day is gonna be so bad and it's gonna go downhill and things are not gonna work out the way we want it to and things are and things will crash down in our faces and when we're trying to go about and try to fix it ourselves and try to do it ourselves When God Says stand still and know that I am God I will make it happen laughs now Moses standing before the burning bush encountered the very presence of God he heard the voice of the Lord commanding him to to go to pharaoh and deliver the Israelites from their bondage from Moses and his humanness was filled with doubts and spheres he questioned his own abilities and hesitated to embrace the Monumental task before him yet in that moment of uncertainty Moses made a decision that changed the course of history he showed surrender over cell phone Reliance he surrendered his doubts his insecurities his limitations and to the all-sufficient god Moses understood that surrendering to God's will meant acknowledging his own insufficiency and embracing the power and authority of the Almighty I mean we don't uh we don't always admit to our own insufficiency we don't admit to God I'm not able to do it we don't like admitting to that because it is us as human and things we we like to think we can do it all we like to think well I can make this happen I I I'm I'm confident in myself I can do it I can make this as happen when in reality we can't and the only way we can surrender to God is we can say God I can't do this God I can't do this by myself I need your help I need yeah you to do it for Me Lord it's not I'm not saying that that we don't do any work out of course no it's not we we uh God uses us as human beings to do his work for him but but I'm talking about those things that we can't control those things that we think maybe we can James this and we're trying our best maybe we can change it maybe we can fix this but in in reality if you're continuously thinking I yes I can fix it I can fix I can fix it instead of looking at God you can fix it lord I can't I I and sometimes we'll get to the place where where we're trying so hard trying so hard in our own abilities that that we realize we've failed and and then we go to God and say say hey God I I couldn't do it can you turn this hole around because I just made a whole mess of everything God I Surrender it to you I give it all to you because I can't do it surrender is committing everything to God and and in your ability in your flesh it's denying yourself saying that's that that's it right there denying yourself because you have to deny yourself in order to surrender to God say say this flesh is not able to do it I am not able to do it no one else is able to do it the doctor said I can't do it I can't get better the doctor said it's not it's not possible but uh instead if we that's the thing we we say well the doctor said the doctor said this doctor said that but but if the doctor is not able to do it sometimes we have to have his head to where to where the doctor said and you're that's it end of story that's it this end it's about to be the end of your story and then we say say now I know the doctor can't do it now I know it's not not possible uh during other times we just string along it's uh well the doctor said this it's gonna get better sometime it's gonna get better then then you're having some faith in the doctors but but it's when the doctor says we can't and then you walk away and you get to you're thinking to yourself I can't do it the doctor can't do it it's when you look at and say you can't when you can't when I can't when the doctor can't it's when it's when you take away the the cross when you take that cross and you carry it away from the can't and you turn it into a can because with that cross you can but it takes it taking that cross away from that can't taking it away and that you can when you're carrying your cross and you say I can't the doctor can't they can't when you're singing on you're hoping that the doctor can that's that that is an example of Faith you're praying and God I hope it happens quicker God I hope it everything continues the way that you said it was gonna and that the doctor said it was going to happen but when the doctor says you can't that's when a real faith kicks in when they're real for when when you're that spiritual sense of faith has to kick in because there's no other option when when there's no other option that that's when desperation comes into play when desperation comes into play and then it has to be it has to be that God's power has to come down and and heal you and that's when God uh has to make a move that's when he he does when you know that God has to do it or things ain't gonna change or thing because the doctor has no hope left for you because if there's hope outside of Christ then you're not hoping in God you're hoping in the doctor you're hoping in somewhere else it's when the hope crumbles down and there's no longer a hope of anything else and all you can do is look to God that's when he'll come down and move when you have to surrender to God surrendering is denying yourself is denying I don't know where that came from that was just God speaking through me right there because I I didn't think of that on my own surrendering to God means letting go of our own agendas our own desires and our own understanding it means placing our trust fully in the one who knows the beginning from the end the one who who holds the universe in his hands when we surrender we exchange our weakness we exchange our weakness we say we're not strong enough we say we can't do it we're not able God take control for his strength and we surrender our doubts and we surrender all these things in exchange for his faithfulness and we surrender our fears for for his perfect love the only and the only time we aim God can can move is when we surrender those things surrender our fears surrender our doubts say because faith cannot work in doubt foreign Moses surrendered his past his insecurities and his comfort in in order to step into the calling of God what happened next God displayed his mighty power through the plagues the party of the Red Sea and the miraculous provision in the wilderness Moses became a vessel of God's because he surrendered himself completely to the place and purposes of God he surrendered to God he even though at the time he was doubtful he was saying God I can't speak God I can't stand speak very good I I'm not the eloquent speech and I can't do this by myself I can't do what you have told me to do but here's the thing when it comes to that confidence is is called you to do it I told you to do this but uh but uh when we're walking outside of God's will when we're walking outside of God's Will and we try to do things how and we have confidence in ourself instead of him that's when things can go down and downhill and and not in the right way that that God wants it to be because God tells us to do something differently and we're we're trying to go our own way and say I can do it I can do it I can do it when it's not what God told us to do but when God tells us to do it then we can have faith and know that we can do it we are able to do it because God has told us to do he's called us to do it today God is calling us to surrender he is calling us to lay down our burdens are lay down our burdens our worries and Ambitions our Ambitions at the foot of the cross he is calling us to her and to relinquish control and allow him to guide our steps in in our surrender God will make a way where there seems to be no way he will lead us through the Wilderness and into the promised land of His blessings Galatians 2 and verse 20 says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of God of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me amen God calls us to die to ourselves to surrender who we are to take up the cross take up our cross and follow him as a Living Sacrifice surrender to our ways surrender to our ideas surrender to what we think we can do and what we and what our ability is to do and and surrendering our uh not just that but surrendering our faith in the doctors the answer and surrounding that and putting that faith in God and knowing that God is going to make a way through this not the doctor not anybody else because when we're having when we have Faith somewhere else in somebody else we're not having faith in God and we're relying on something else [Music] but when we have faith in God when we when we they surrender everything to God surrender it whatever it is to God he'll he'll come and he'll take control of it and he and he'll when we when we rely on him sometimes when we have no choice but to rely on him and that's when when he'll move not other times when we think we can and control it now to to be able to say not my will Lord but yours sacrificing who we are there to be it to be what he wants us to be and so hard sometimes to say God you take control of the situation you take control of what I'm going through I commit it to you why why because we must let go of our worries and doubts and take on faith the only way we can take on faith is by letting go of worries in doubt take on faith and trusting in God that it's in his hands now let's see I don't got to how much time do I got what excuse me let's say r820 I time time sure flies when when you're yeah when you're having a good time Joe now we all know the story of Job what he went through there and and everything that the suffering that that God put him through it allowed him to go through excuse me allowed him to go and go through everything that that he had had dealt with he could he could have just gave it all up and committed suicide or or whatever he could have just said that I've had enough of this uh why is God punishing me all the religious leaders gather around him saying look at you what have you done wrong to deserve this you're going You're Going Through Hell so to speak why is God punishing you like this there must be some reason there must be something and we would have thought the same same thing if if there was a joke in this day God tuck your family God took your wife well now your wife everything but your wife the god Tucker in your house God tuck your your the things you own God took all your animals everything why don't you just Curse God and die that's what that's why I told him but he's in but he instead of doing that he said he he said I'll speak is like a foolish woman and and and he said said the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord he surrendered to God regardless of what was happening he surrendered to God he said said I don't care if if all hell's against me I don't care if if everything thing is crashing down in my eye life and I I and God took his health god well allowed the devil to do all this to him because God God doesn't put that on upon his believer says the devil he allows that to happen to us right it's the devil that that that does that to us because Brandon said that God cannot or will not rather or inflict sickness illness upon on his people he will not inflict us with and we say why God why you letting me suffer the through this he's allowing us to to go through that he's allowing those things to come upon us but he's not inflicting upon us he's not putting upon us that's what brother Branham said but but job was suffering so much so much sober so badly and yet he he surrendered it to God he said I don't care what happens now I don't care what I have nothing to lose he had nothing to lose but he he trusted and God he he surrendered to God and God gave him everything back because he surrendered it to God because he said and regardless of the situation regardless of what's going on regardless of what God is allowing me to go through I'm going to trust in God and I'm not going to allow my wife to talk me out of out of my faith in my in my father I'm not gonna let anything talk me out of this because God is in control I trust that God is in control and I don't know what I've done wrong but I'm not gonna going to uh I'm not going to give up I'm uh because God gave me all that it gave me everything he gave me my health it gave me it gave me my my house it gave me my family it gave me my children he can take it away if he wants to and I'm not gonna do anything about that I'm just gonna surrender my life to him regardless of what happened ourselves dead and alive to Christ but when he made the way that when we allow we we could sacrifice ourselves to to his service to follow him if we followed him we lead the life that that he lived that's wonderful amen and I won't be too much longer in in Luke 9 and verse 23 it says um and he said to them if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life will lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man Advantage if he gained the whole world and lose himself and be Cast Away Lucy's own in other words lose his own soul and and be Cast Away into hell what would it matter if you become president you become all these things if you just lose it all if you and be cast into into hell now it says here brother Brandon said come follow me take up your cross deny yourself come after me I'll break the chains I'll break the ranks of the enemy uh break the ranks of sin I'll break the ranks of sickness and and you follow me and fight as the best you can for I'll make a hole through it and your homes will be preserved unto eternal life amen please stand if you will musicians if you'll come amen God says if we want to follow him we must deny ourselves deny means to refuse to refuse to give or Grant or in other words in this context refuse to to allow our flesh to have control of our life and refuse the choice of following our flesh following what what this flesh wants and commit it to him we we must refuse the desires of this flesh every day surrender to to Jesus give him all of our attention and seek Him above everything else give him everything we are and where and will be till we get to the place where we can say I am his and his alone I I don't want any part of this world all I want to do is serve him the old man is dead I am a new creation in Christ when we can say I am his and his alone not none of these things in this world can dead take that away from me none nothing in the world will I surrender to but him nothing in this world I am I only belong to him I am and I don't follow the things in my flesh I am crucified daily following him on a closer walk with him every single day and I don't care what anybody else says I don't care what pops up I don't care what no phone calls also happen and and things while I'm praying I don't care what things come up just forget it put that phone on silent and go back to praying forget it and and surrender everything to him surrender your time that's one thing that that is the hardest one of the hardest things to do as a Believer is surrendering your time because you're as when you're surrendering your time you're surrendering your life people will say I would die for Christ but would you live for him would you live for him and what does that mean and to live for him it means everything a thing you do is for him everything you are is for him amen if you would sing uh I surrender all Softly because that's what it takes in this world it takes surrendering everything into to him it takes committing everything to you to him [Music] because the Lord Jesus Christ wants our surrender he surrendered himself upon the cross to Die For Us on that cross for an example that we may take up our cross to follow him [Music] every headband does anyone here tonight that has things unsurrendered while you left your hands to him tonight uh surrendered all to him surrendered to surrender there are those things that come up in our in our lives and things that are trying to detect us from being to surrender everything to him because [Music] there's things the surrender of our time [Music] a hard time in him our time and effort is surrender to the devil oh dude [Applause] us to give our everything to him there's a story that says you'll understand when I say this is chicken in this this pig that asked and all that this chicken said hey let's let's go in and give and then well there's a this shop that says eggs and and ham and eggs and bacon and desperately wanted and and the chicken said why don't we give this to the demand let's give this a demand and then the pig said you're crazy I have to give up everything that I am I have to to give up myself you might be laughing at that but but but that the chicken and it has only has to lay eggs for them but the the what we don't want to do is we don't want to give ourselves completely we want to say this egg here this egg here like that that chicken this egg here when God uh desires there's to have a bacon pork every everything but God's desires are surrendered not just a little here not just a little there but God wants us to fully surrender to it to him not just a part of our life not a little bit not just that's what we're we so willingly want to do is to give it a little here little there but but when it comes to surrendering our whole selves as a Living Sacrifice into him nothing left in me nothing of me left to him to give him if we can just surrender everything to him not that there's nothing left of us in our flesh but only Christ that people might see Christ in US
