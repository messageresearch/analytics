[13:53] morning I told uh told Brother William
[13:57] Brother David I just don't get up here
[13:58] and make everybody upset then they'll
[14:01] have to get them back in good spirits
[14:03] for service
[14:05] starts I was looking around outside
[14:12] yesterday we're letting our
[14:15] trash get out of hand over in our
[14:19] provision over there and on the pick a
[14:21] ball court
[14:23] and just scattered around
[14:27] um if if you're able to take a cup up up
[14:33] there you should be able to do something
[14:35] with the
[14:37] cup when you're
[14:40] done I'm
[14:42] uh the Lord has blessed us
[14:47] abundantly and uh I noticed this even
[14:51] goes back I just sort of
[14:53] watch uh even from the bonfire and
[14:58] everything that we have had the week
[15:00] before the trash was left up there and
[15:04] then last weekend with us having the
[15:06] carry in it just accumulated
[15:10] more so after service
[15:13] today I'm expecting
[15:16] volunteers to go up there and clean
[15:20] up another thing
[15:23] is we have people from in the
[15:26] neighborhood bring their kids of course
[15:28] and play
[15:30] um and that that was expected after we
[15:33] put up the
[15:35] playground but they have been really
[15:39] good about not
[15:42] trashing our area uh but I'm afraid if
[15:48] we don't keep it
[15:50] clean what's going to happen is you know
[15:53] hey they don't care so why should I care
[15:56] and
[15:57] so uh I want have them to talk
[16:00] to so I just like for that to be took
[16:04] care of today and I notice the broom
[16:07] handle has got broke uh we'll get that
[16:11] fixed I know y'all need it to clean the
[16:14] rocks and stuff off the pick a ball
[16:16] court so that'll get took care of but
[16:19] let's just try to take care of what the
[16:22] Lord has blessed us
[16:24] with this also applies to the fellowship
[16:27] building
[16:29] um if you have an event or or something
[16:33] or even if you just come to
[16:35] play uh pingpong that's perfectly okay
[16:39] but don't leave a mess down there uh
[16:43] it's Sister Mary Jane and sister Jessica
[16:46] clean the church and
[16:47] everything
[16:49] but I don't want to put more of a
[16:52] hardship on them to feel like they have
[16:55] to check behind us done it Fellowship
[16:58] building
[16:59] too they do a really good
[17:02] job and so that's just basically what I
[17:06] had to say
[17:09] uh did I miss anything my wife knows
[17:12] what I was going to say because I told
[17:17] her uh if you put food in the
[17:22] trash uh let's try to tie that up or do
[17:27] something Brother David has been super
[17:30] faithful about hauling getting rid of
[17:34] the trash once it's and so uh I asked
[17:37] him this morning I said do you mind he
[17:39] says no said I I don't mind said uh I've
[17:42] got somewhere to put it so let's get
[17:45] everything in bags let's get it tied up
[17:49] and uh and we'll put it in his truck
[17:53] so I think that's that's everything that
[17:57] wasn't too painful was it
[18:00] okay as long as we just clean up behind
[18:02] ourselves and and remember this you know
[18:08] we got a very nice facility very nice
[18:12] and uh we're going to take care of it
[18:16] okay Lord bless you brother
[18:26] Troy we'll just all standing this
[18:33] morning got the bad news out of the way
[18:35] now we're here for the good news so no
[18:39] that's that's good we definitely want to
[18:41] keep it clean um if
[18:44] you'll just bow your heads maybe brother
[18:46] Joe will open us in prayer this
[18:57] morning e
[19:28] believe
[19:58] you
[20:31] all
[21:01] tell
[21:32] amen the children can be dismissed for
[21:34] Sunday school and if you'll go with me
[21:36] in the
[21:37] Psalms we're going to go to Psalms
[21:41] 71 it's a little bit longer Psalms but
[21:46] um Psalm
[21:50] 71 it's an encouraging
[21:53] Psalms Psalm 71 in thee Oh Lord do I put
[21:57] my trust let me never be put to
[22:08] confusion be thou my strong habitation
[22:11] wherein to I may continually Resort thou
[22:15] Hast given commandment to save me for th
[22:18] Thou Art my rock and my
[22:27] Fortress for thou art My Hope Oh Lord
[22:30] God Thou Art my trust from my
[22:43] youth I am as a Wonder unto many but
[22:47] Thou Art my strong
[22:54] Refuge cast me not off in the time of
[22:57] old age for take me not when my strength
[23:07] faileth saying God hath forsaken him
[23:10] persecute and take him for there is none
[23:12] to deliver
[23:19] him let them be confounded and consumed
[23:22] that are adversaries to my soul let them
[23:25] be covered with reproach and dishonor
[23:27] that seek my hurt
[23:34] my mouth shall show forth thy
[23:36] righteousness and thy salvation all the
[23:38] day for I know not the number
[23:48] thereof oh God thou Hast taught me from
[23:51] my youth and hither to have I declared
[23:54] thy wondrous works

[24:43] Hast
[24:44] redeemed my tongue also shall talk of
[24:47] thy righteousness all the day long for
[24:50] they are confounded for they are brought
[24:52] unto shame that seek my hurt God bless
[24:55] you may be seated brother Brian
[25:12] morning brothers and
[25:15] sisters if you would turn with me to uh
[25:19] you can turn to Luke the 6th chapter and
[25:21] then
[25:22] Ephesians the fourth
[25:27] chapter you
[25:29] not about what brother Steve was saying
[25:31] but people are
[25:32] people you know that uh that Parable
[25:36] that talks about narrow is the
[25:38] way broad is you know Broad and narrow
[25:41] is the way that's just you can't get
[25:43] away from Human Nature you know it's
[25:45] just that way everyone wants to take the
[25:47] easy path no one wants to take the hard
[25:49] path but
[25:52] um I lost my place
[25:56] here uh about the 46th
[26:00] verse of the sixth chapter of in
[26:06] Luke we just before I get started this
[26:09] is the beginning of this
[26:10] month um I had the the I just chant the
[26:15] southern states did fill up the tanks in
[26:18] December so all the all the propane
[26:22] tanks are filled up I don't know how
[26:24] much it cost us though I'll know that in
[26:26] a week or two and then we have to make
[26:29] another quarterly insurance payment on
[26:32] the uh about the 15th of December and
[26:36] that'll be about $1,000 payment so
[26:39] that's where we're at and then in the
[26:41] general fund it's gotten a lot better
[26:43] we're back up to about $88,500 in the
[26:46] general fund so of course I'll have to
[26:49] pay the insurance payment and the um and
[26:52] the fill up but we're getting back on
[26:55] where we were at before we started doing
[26:57] all that work in in August but I was uh
[27:02] listening to a few messages this morning
[27:06] and over the week and I was just was
[27:09] thinking in the world the world we live
[27:12] in just like the psalm we just
[27:14] read uh it's I was just thinking about
[27:18] the world everything is falling apart
[27:20] out there in the world you there's no
[27:23] safety out there in the world and and I
[27:25] was just thinking in my office this
[27:27] morning
[27:29] you know our lives are just like an old
[27:32] uh childhood nursery rhyme about the
[27:35] three little pigs and I I'm going to I'm
[27:38] going to read this this morning and and
[27:41] which which one of them are you and I'm
[27:43] hoping you're the one that has built
[27:45] your house with stone and not with hay
[27:48] this morning but I'll just read this
[27:50] here uh if I got myself to the right
[27:54] place I'll start at about the um we all
[27:56] know that a
[27:59] Jesus was giv Parables about trees
[28:01] there's good trees and bad trees and
[28:03] then I'll start about the about the 43rd
[28:07] verse I'm going further back I know I do
[28:09] this a lot for a good tree bringeth
[28:12] forth not corrupt fruit and neither does
[28:15] a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
[28:17] it's impossible you're like brother
[28:20] Brown said your nature is going to
[28:22] people know who you really are once you
[28:24] get out there and mingle with people
[28:26] they see the good and the bad side you
[28:28] You Can't Hide who you are sooner or
[28:29] later everyone's going to know who you
[28:31] are and what you are and he goes on
[28:33] every tree is known by his own fruits
[28:36] for the Thorns of men do not gather for
[28:39] of thorns men do not gather figs nor of
[28:42] a Bramble Bush gather they grapes so
[28:45] whatever you are whatever type of fruit
[28:47] you bear that's what people receive from
[28:50] you and a good man out of the good
[28:53] Treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[28:54] that which is good and an evil man out
[28:57] of evil treasure of his heart bringeth
[28:59] forth that which is evil for out of the
[29:01] abundance of the heart is the mouth
[29:03] speaketh so you you know a lot of people
[29:06] say you can talk a good talk but do you
[29:08] live what you actually talk about and a
[29:12] lot of times people don't realize who
[29:14] they really are until other people start
[29:15] telling them what they see in their
[29:17] lives but I'm I was thinking about these
[29:19] four verses here this morning and he
[29:22] said when why call you me Lord Lord and
[29:25] do not the things which I say and that's
[29:28] where we're at this morning in this
[29:30] world whosoever cometh to me and heareth
[29:33] my sayings and doeth them I will show
[29:35] you to whom he is
[29:37] like he is like a man which built his
[29:40] house and dig deep and laid a foundation
[29:43] on a rock and when the flood Rose the
[29:46] stream beat verly upon that house and it
[29:49] could not shake it for it was founded
[29:51] upon a rock and that everyone here this
[29:54] morning has a foundation everyone here
[29:57] has built a building building in Christ
[29:59] this morning or you haven't and when the
[30:01] storms come what is going to hold and
[30:05] sometimes we don't find out until we
[30:08] have trials and we have struggles in our
[30:11] life what kind of foundation we really
[30:13] have and that's the worst time in your
[30:15] life to find out what kind of foundation
[30:17] you have when all the world is falling
[30:19] apart you want to have the right
[30:21] foundation this morning you want to have
[30:23] that right experience you want a house
[30:26] that's built by Jesus Christ this
[30:27] morning morning so when the storms of
[30:29] life push against you that your
[30:32] foundation doesn't fall and and I was
[30:34] just thinking the world we living is
[30:36] just falling apart this morning the
[30:38] whole world is just being shaken you
[30:40] know and that it goes back to uh Hebrews
[30:43] the 12th chapter everything that will be
[30:45] shaken will be shaken and when you look
[30:48] out there in the world there's no hope
[30:49] the only hope is in and I'll go on and
[30:52] but he that heareth and doeth not is
[30:54] like a man that without a foundation is
[30:57] built upon the house and the Earth
[30:59] against which the stream did bended me
[31:01] and immediately it fell and the runin of
[31:03] the house was great and um I know we
[31:07] don't want to be that example this
[31:08] morning and I was just thinking of that
[31:11] nursery rhyme about the Three Little
[31:12] Pigs we you don't want to be the one
[31:15] that when the wolf blows down blows your
[31:17] house down on that day and the only way
[31:20] that you'll have that Foundation goes
[31:22] back to what we were what I was thinking
[31:25] about earlier there's two paths that we
[31:27] take there's a narrow path like in
[31:29] Pilgrim's Progress it's a narrow path
[31:32] it's a hard path to follow you have to
[31:34] stay in study of God's word you have to
[31:37] stay prayed up every day to stay on that
[31:39] narrow way that leads to righteousness
[31:42] that leads to Salvation and really in
[31:45] life there's a Broadway and that's the
[31:47] easy path and that path in the end will
[31:50] bring you to destruction but I I'm not
[31:52] going to I say that but I'm not going to
[31:54] read if you would go to the fourth
[31:56] chapter of Ephesians
[31:58] Ians starting at about the 16th ver it
[32:03] kind of starts with what I was saying
[32:05] this morning from when the whole body
[32:07] Filly joined together compacted by that
[32:10] which every joint supplieth according to
[32:12] the affectionally working of measure
[32:15] this is the fourth chapter of Ephesians
[32:17] the 16th verse I know I get in a hurry
[32:20] sometimes according to the effectual
[32:22] working in the measure of every part
[32:25] maketh increase of the body unto the ad
[32:28] ifying of itself and love goes back to
[32:30] what I was saying the whole body is put
[32:33] together and when it's put together
[32:35] correctly nothing can shake it apart and
[32:37] I say therefore and testify in the Lord
[32:40] that you henceforth walk not as others
[32:43] Gentiles walk in the vanity of their
[32:45] mind you know you can read that
[32:48] scripture this morning and you can see
[32:51] it out there in the world today they're
[32:52] just running after their the vanities of
[32:55] this life and he goes on to say having
[32:58] the understanding darkened and being
[33:00] alienated from the life of God through
[33:02] the ignorance that is in them because of
[33:05] the blindness of Their Own Heart who
[33:08] being past feeling have given themselves
[33:10] over to lishness to work all unclean
[33:15] with greediness forgive my
[33:17] pronunciations of those words but you
[33:20] have not so learned Christ and that's
[33:23] what I'm thinking this morning that's
[33:25] not what I've learned I've learned what
[33:27] God has taught me in the word of God
[33:29] this morning in the message of the hour
[33:31] which is total opposite of what I just
[33:33] read he goes on to say if it if it so be
[33:36] that you have heard him and have been
[33:39] taught by him as the truth is in Jesus
[33:42] that you that ye put off concerning the
[33:45] former conversation the old man which is
[33:48] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[33:52] and uh and be renewed in the spirit of
[33:54] your mind and we go on to this 2 fourth
[33:58] verse says that you put on the new man
[34:01] which is after God is created in
[34:03] righteousness and true Holiness and it
[34:05] goes back to that Foundation that Jesus
[34:07] was talking about if you have that true
[34:10] foundation and God has built this house
[34:12] and built this body in you then you
[34:15] there's nothing that can shake it death
[34:17] whatever it is nothing will shake it
[34:19] wherefore putting away lying speak every
[34:21] man truth with his neighbor for we are
[34:24] members one
[34:26] another uh be be angry and sin not let
[34:30] not the sun go down upon your WRA so
[34:32] Paul's given us nuggets here he's given
[34:35] us principles this morning how we were
[34:37] to interact with each other as brothers
[34:39] and sisters this morning did to give
[34:43] place to the devil let him that stole
[34:45] steal no more but rather let him label
[34:47] working with his hands the things which
[34:50] is good that you may have to give him
[34:53] that needeth and when I read the
[34:55] scriptures I think it's so simple I mean
[34:58] I know God puts it so simple but a lot
[35:01] of times it's in the it's not in the
[35:03] nature of man to look at what he needs
[35:06] to do for salvation he thinks he has to
[35:09] do some great thing or he has to
[35:11] struggle with it but all it is is simply
[35:13] believe in God just letting go and
[35:16] believe in God's word and just letting
[35:18] it have its way with you that God does
[35:21] it and you don't do it yourself and uh I
[35:24] lost my place and he goes be angry and
[35:28] sin not let the sun go down on neither
[35:30] give place to the devil let him that
[35:32] stole no more rather let him label
[35:35] working with his hands that things which
[35:37] is good that he may have to give them
[35:39] which
[35:40] needeth and this is really important in
[35:43] this age that we liveing it's to really
[35:46] control your mind control your heart and
[35:48] your life and your soul that when you
[35:51] speak to people that you don't let the
[35:53] corrupt communication that doesn't
[35:56] there's more that speaking corrupt
[35:58] Community speaking a neev negative
[36:00] confession speaking something that's not
[36:02] positive to people you know you should
[36:04] be biting your if all you can say to
[36:06] something somebody is something negative
[36:08] or something that's not upbeating then
[36:11] it really shouldn't be said you should
[36:13] everything you when you communicate to
[36:15] people should be uplifting should be in
[36:18] everything should be have a good voice
[36:20] to it does it mean that if you have to
[36:22] talk to somebody about something they
[36:23] did wrong there's a right way to talk to
[36:26] people about when they do things wrong
[36:28] let not corrupt Communications proceed
[36:30] out of your mouth by that which is good
[36:33] to the use of edifying that it may
[36:35] Minister Grace unto the hearers and
[36:38] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[36:40] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[36:42] redemption let all bitterness and wrath
[36:45] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[36:47] be put away from you with all malice and
[36:51] be you kind one to another tenderhearted
[36:54] forgiving one another even as God for
[36:56] Christ's sake has forgiven you you know
[36:59] that the thing I I see in a in the word
[37:03] when I look at the word of
[37:09] God it sometimes it's so simple it's
[37:12] even hard for me to reason with it
[37:15] sometimes but as you read what Paul had
[37:18] to say in Ephesians 4th chapter you you
[37:21] read in Luke the 6th
[37:24] chapter what I realize is
[37:28] not how much you can manufacture
[37:29] something it's but it's how much you can
[37:32] get low enough in your life to let God
[37:34] do it for you where you're not
[37:36] struggling with the things in life but
[37:39] you're willing to let go I I mean I got
[37:41] to be
[37:42] honest that's that's a hard thing for me
[37:45] it's in my Baldwin traits is sometimes I
[37:49] get ahead of my skis as I say I want to
[37:52] do it myself instead of letting God do
[37:54] it for me and in this age that we living
[37:57] right now it's really important before
[37:59] you make whatever that decision is in
[38:02] your life that you pray about it you
[38:05] look at God's word and you desire to do
[38:08] what God would have you to do it's real
[38:10] easy to run ahead when you run ahead
[38:14] sometimes when you get to the end of the
[38:15] path you find out that you left a lot
[38:18] behind with you that you should have
[38:19] brought along with you so if I not
[38:22] wanting to menander and thought the most
[38:24] important thing I thought this morning
[38:26] this world is falling
[38:28] apart and what hope do we have but in
[38:31] Jesus Christ this morning I I know I say
[38:33] that a lot but I I was just looking at
[38:35] the uh political events going on in the
[38:37] world and and I I think of the message
[38:40] of the hour what brother brandham taught
[38:42] in the message you know and he taught
[38:44] about those different powers when you
[38:47] when you see the Roman power where you
[38:49] see the leader of the Roman Church
[38:52] allowing outright filthy sin in the
[38:55] church and then you see see China is on
[38:59] the March that bamboo curtain like
[39:01] brother Bram thought it's on the March
[39:03] it wants to conquer the known world you
[39:06] you
[39:07] see the you see the Israeli conflict you
[39:10] see the Syrian conflict you see the
[39:12] Russians you see the north you see that
[39:15] bear you see all this conflict in the
[39:18] world it just lets me know that every
[39:20] day is precious and we just brings us
[39:23] closer to that time where God's going to
[39:25] Rapture the church and I from what I see
[39:28] in the world today I I would just
[39:30] encourage you all we don't want to be
[39:32] here after that day we all want to go up
[39:35] to heaven in the Rapture this morning
[39:37] and just like Jesus said in in Luke the
[39:40] 6th chapter that Foundation that house
[39:44] it has to be built on Jesus Christ this
[39:47] morning if it's not built on that it
[39:50] won't hold it won't last on that day uh
[39:53] Brother David

[40:02] morning

[1:09:34] begin
[1:09:40] Revelations and this is an expression
[1:09:43] now of course once again of when the

[1:13:06] same yesterday today and forever he's
[1:13:09] the beginning he's the ending he's the
[1:13:11] author and finisher of our faith he is
[1:13:14] more than what I ever can take five
[1:13:16] hours to express amen praise God every

[1:13:51] was the prophetic age Amen brother

[1:13:57] one of those Powers amen voiced their
[1:13:59] opinion amen and they heard amen saying
[1:14:02] blessing and honor amen they all say
[1:14:05] praise you can be seated this morning
[1:14:07] may God add His blessings to the reading
[1:14:09] of the word amen we just wanted to recap
[1:14:11] we're talking basically and trying to
[1:14:13] speak on what God is amen and talking
[1:14:18] about what he does Amen his attributes
[1:14:21] the attributes amen the attributes of
[1:14:24] God now we know those attributes was
[1:14:27] that before there was ever the first
[1:14:30] Stardust was ever created before the
[1:14:32] first star was hung before there was any
[1:14:35] Angels before there was anything at all
[1:14:38] God was all by
[1:14:40] himself for eons of time we don't know
[1:14:42] it's
[1:14:44] unfathomable amen the human mind can't
[1:14:47] comprehend the greatness of almighty God
[1:14:50] just not big enough to do it but yet we
[1:14:53] know that he is amen and way back before
[1:14:56] then he had something in him Amen to
[1:14:59] express amen and so he wanted to express
[1:15:02] it and the only way he could express it
[1:15:04] was to create a situation like what
[1:15:07] we're in right now how many believes
[1:15:10] that this was the plan of God this was
[1:15:13] no accident not just what happened and
[1:15:15] I'm going to make adjustments God don't
[1:15:17] work that way he don't make adjustments
[1:15:20] just you know as he goes along he knew
[1:15:22] the beginning from the end he said I am
[1:15:25] the beginning and I am the ending I'm
[1:15:27] the first and the last I'm Alpha and
[1:15:29] Omega he is all of that amen so there's
[1:15:32] nothing no surprises to
[1:15:34] God Amen can I recap Wednesday night a
[1:15:38] little bit for y'all that didn't hear
[1:15:40] hear it and mean we talked about how
[1:15:42] that uh God loves to put trials on us he
[1:15:46] loves to test
[1:15:48] us bad things
[1:15:51] happen he allows bad things to happen
[1:15:58] we're going to recap here a little bit
[1:15:59] before we get into my message praise the
[1:16:02] Lord that's
[1:16:05] right I don't think I have my other
[1:16:08] one that's right he loves to just put us
[1:16:12] into places like he did Israel after he
[1:16:15] brought them out like I said you know
[1:16:17] sometimes it seems like God could do
[1:16:19] things and get things fixed up before we
[1:16:21] get there but sometimes he don't like
[1:16:23] Israel he didn't have the red SE open he
[1:16:25] leted him to go down into a trap so to
[1:16:27] speak is't that right get him into what
[1:16:29] he calls a trap prophet of God says he
[1:16:31] put him right there in a trap he me he
[1:16:33] he puts you sometimes right in a trap to
[1:16:36] see what you do about it he put them in
[1:16:39] a trap down there amen and my whole core
[1:16:42] of men tonight was don't worry about the
[1:16:44] Trap God is not not God is not concerned
[1:16:48] with your
[1:16:49] trial it's not about the trial that's
[1:16:56] hello remember job he was a perfect man
[1:16:59] there was no reason to put a trial on
[1:17:01] him perfect most upright is that right
[1:17:04] and our scripture for my thought this
[1:17:05] morning is job God allowed that to come
[1:17:08] upon him and he went to Satan said hey
[1:17:10] have you considered my servant job Jo
[1:17:13] and and Satan said what he said yeah
[1:17:16] yeah all that a man has you know but if
[1:17:18] you take all of his stuff and everything
[1:17:20] away he says he'll curse you to your
[1:17:23] face so it was about what job would
[1:17:28] do that God allowed job to go through
[1:17:31] that trial go through that test God
[1:17:34] allows us to go through tests and not so
[1:17:36] much God can just use anything he wants
[1:17:39] to put a test on
[1:17:43] you he'll have somebody cut you off on
[1:17:46] the road or something you know and see
[1:17:48] what kind of road rage that you have and
[1:17:51] that right do any kind but he uses
[1:17:53] different things and with job he allowed
[1:17:55] all this to come upon Him amen and God
[1:17:56] was going to prove to the devil that job
[1:17:59] wasn't going to curse
[1:18:01] God because if you'll notice every time
[1:18:04] after the first chapter he says job said
[1:18:06] the lord gave the Lord taken away
[1:18:09] blessed be the name of the Lord that was
[1:18:11] the response that God was looking
[1:18:14] for it is not about the trial it is
[1:18:17] about your attitude and your response to
[1:18:20] the trial that God is looking for
[1:18:25] woo I believe we need that down in our
[1:18:27] hard drive don't you way down in the
[1:18:29] core of our
[1:18:31] car
[1:18:33] amen just as me and my wife as you know
[1:18:35] we got that bad news ain't that right
[1:18:38] amen of the doctor saying just saying
[1:18:41] that hey you you know when when I said I
[1:18:44] I said well what what can we do are you
[1:18:45] going to move remove the breast what are
[1:18:47] you going to do no there's no use in
[1:18:48] removing it it it just cause the car you
[1:18:50] are going to die of breast cancer is
[1:18:53] what she told her very bluntly which is
[1:18:55] I guess the way we need it and of course
[1:18:58] you know that was a real shock when
[1:18:59] somebody tell you are going to
[1:19:02] die huh like I said earlier you know if
[1:19:05] somebody says you know you know you know
[1:19:07] you've got cancer but I'll tell you what
[1:19:09] it's a tumor and I believe we can cut it
[1:19:10] off I you know you've got hope there but
[1:19:14] when there's no
[1:19:15] hope amen you're in a
[1:19:18] trap what are you going to

[1:19:25] boohoo and and falling on her lap and
[1:19:27] may everything else you know but she was
[1:19:30] like what you crying

[1:19:40] words but a it's okay and she's smiling
[1:19:43] and stuff and you know the whole way the
[1:19:45] whole way through this she never got
[1:19:46] that fear never got that scared that
[1:19:48] that's what she said that's what the
[1:19:50] doctor said that's not what I said
[1:19:52] that's not what God says
[1:19:59] and I'm just going to go ahead and say
[1:20:01] it but you her breast was all it's got a
[1:20:03] big big spot on it big red the whole
[1:20:06] thing was almost big and red and it's

[1:20:19] dramatically amen but you know you can
[1:20:22] either have doubt and you can think
[1:20:23] about the feeling funeral and you can
[1:20:25] think about the suffering of death and
[1:20:27] everything you can think about that and
[1:20:29] you can

[1:20:39] sorrow come upon me and I begin to cry
[1:20:40] out God spare Lord Jesus and I it was
[1:20:44] not I didn't feel like it was me but I
[1:20:46] felt like God put this upon me two times
[1:20:48] it happened two times majorly amen that
[1:20:51] I just went down on my knees on the bail
[1:20:53] of head and began to cry out to God Amen
[1:20:56] it said God you said that the righteous
[1:20:58] cry and I hear them and deliver them out
[1:21:01] of their own that's what you said God
[1:21:03] Amen and I begin to inter I felt like I
[1:21:05] was
[1:21:06] interceding how many believe we need
[1:21:08] some interceder when God puts that
[1:21:10] intercession you and begin to pray amen
[1:21:13] that's God doing not you trying to
[1:21:15] manufacture something but I believe that
[1:21:18] it's God doing
[1:21:20] something amen but a trap talk about
[1:21:23] this trap that we get into it Israel get
[1:21:25] into this trap and I found so much that
[1:21:27] I've had to come up to the level of
[1:21:29] faith that my wife has you know God is
[1:21:31] more than able he's the same yesterday
[1:21:34] today and forever and we know amen that

[1:21:46] healed all you got to do is meet those
[1:21:49] same conditions because God is the same

[1:21:57] Ghost amen everybody got anybody that
[1:21:59] ever got saved amen got the baptism of
[1:22:01] the Holy Ghost on the inside you meet
[1:22:03] those same conditions this morning amen
[1:22:05] and you can have it
[1:22:07] too no matter what it
[1:22:11] is oh I'm so glad that all of God's
[1:22:14] promises the Bible says are yay and amen
[1:22:18] they are positive there's nothing
[1:22:21] negative about this these promises God
[1:22:24] has given us exceeding and great and
[1:22:26] precious promises the Bible says it's
[1:22:29] not just
[1:22:30] salvation it's healing it's Deliverance
[1:22:34] it's Joy it's peace it's all of those
[1:22:36] things there's so much that's
[1:22:41] ours
[1:22:43] amen praise the
[1:22:52] Lord amen it's our responsibility to
[1:22:56] believe God's it's his responsibility to
[1:23:00] do
[1:23:02] rest
[1:23:03] amen this morning I want to title this
[1:23:07] The Great Escape The Great
[1:23:10] Escape we talked about being in a trap
[1:23:13] how Bud like to hear about getting out
[1:23:15] of the Trap I like that amen so God
[1:23:19] allows us to get in traps he allows it
[1:23:23] he did Israel isn't it
[1:23:25] something because he loves to see your
[1:23:27] response see how you
[1:23:30] respond because right here brother bam
[1:23:32] says he puts you right in that trap to
[1:23:34] see what you're going to
[1:23:37] do he put them in that trap right down
[1:23:40] there amen praise the Lord but listen to
[1:23:44] what he says the writer once says he
[1:23:47] says when they got into that place
[1:23:48] wondered that what Moses would do see
[1:23:51] God had commanded go forward go go
[1:23:54] forward if you're in the line of duty no
[1:23:57] matter what comes in the way he says the
[1:24:00] greatest experiences that I've ever had
[1:24:02] that I've come up against something that
[1:24:04] I couldn't get over it couldn't get
[1:24:06] under it am mean just stand there and
[1:24:09] watch God make a way
[1:24:14] through that's right that's the way to
[1:24:17] do it just keep moving keep moving just
[1:24:20] press your nose right up against it he
[1:24:23] said
[1:24:24] you come up against the wall God wall
[1:24:26] God say just keep on going that's what
[1:24:29] Israel hey we're going to just stand
[1:24:31] still and see the salvation of God but
[1:24:34] don't
[1:24:37] doubt now one more point that I made
[1:24:39] Wednesday was that the Bible says that
[1:24:41] they provoke God by unbelief first he
[1:24:43] gets them in a trap a place they can't
[1:24:46] get around can't get over can't get
[1:24:47] around it and then when they murmur and
[1:24:49] complain God gets angry with them right
[1:24:56] hey that's my daddy you're talking about
[1:24:59] that's right that's right like some of
[1:25:01] our daddies you fall down and skin your
[1:25:03] knee a little bit after you get so big
[1:25:05] Ain that right when they're little oh
[1:25:06] you might pet them and stuff but when
[1:25:08] they get it's just a little scratch quit
[1:25:10] your whining quit crying so much
[1:25:13] huh cruel daddies sometime whip our kids
[1:25:17] and then say all right dry it up or I'll
[1:25:19] give you some more
[1:25:24] Mike and Caleb now they're like yeah we
[1:25:27] you know they're like well it's easier
[1:25:29] to dry this up than it is to say in them
[1:25:31] more but that's what God told Moses god
[1:25:34] Moses cried he was crying to him and God
[1:25:37] says why are you crying why Cry To Me
[1:25:40] Speak the word and go forward how many
[1:25:43] believe that's what we got to do speak
[1:25:45] the word say What God Says and go
[1:25:49] forward amen keep going forward just
[1:25:53] keep on going
[1:25:55] amen praise the Lord he says just keep
[1:25:58] on going God Will Make A Way because God
[1:26:04] is a
[1:26:05] specialist of the
[1:26:07] impossible once you come to the place of
[1:26:09] impossible and not anything you can do
[1:26:12] that's where God is a specialist of
[1:26:14] stepping in if he's got to wall up the
[1:26:17] waters dry up the land and walk
[1:26:21] across amen praise the Lord
[1:26:25] are that's right and they did and I'm
[1:26:29] believing that he's the same today as he
[1:26:33] was yesterday God hasn't changed
[1:26:41] any
[1:26:44] amen now when you uh when you get into
[1:26:48] this trap and let me just start out by
[1:26:51] saying this that
[1:26:55] every one of
[1:26:57] us was
[1:27:00] born in this
[1:27:02] trap we were
[1:27:05] born in sin shaped in iniquity come into
[1:27:11] this world speaking lies what does that
[1:27:14] child do as soon as they get old enough
[1:27:17] and smart enough to do they'll
[1:27:21] lie they're not angels
[1:27:24] huh no they're first they were born with
[1:27:27] the first wrong nature I mean we were
[1:27:30] born with the wrong nature why do you
[1:27:32] think God said that you got to be born
[1:27:34] again Born Again of the
[1:27:39] spirit amen let me just say this
[1:27:42] somebody asked brother Bram he says you
[1:27:44] know I'm a Christian but I still have
[1:27:46] these desires I still do these things do
[1:27:48] these things he says well just what
[1:27:50] happens if a tree dies or a a follow the
[1:27:54] year comes and the life goes down in
[1:27:57] amen and what happens all those leaves
[1:27:59] just drop
[1:28:00] off and he says that's the way with a
[1:28:03] born again believer when you change your
[1:28:05] nature the old leaves they just F they
[1:28:08] just fade
[1:28:10] away when God comes and he takes
[1:28:12] something from you it's
[1:28:14] finished amen but we were born in a trap
[1:28:19] born without hope in this world
[1:28:27] condemn amen what a terrible place to
[1:28:31] find
[1:28:35] ourselves amen and let's admit it this
[1:28:40] is a cruel
[1:28:45] place you know in all of this it makes
[1:28:48] the reality of dying a little bit more
[1:28:52] real the fact that we all come to that
[1:28:56] place we're all going to come to that
[1:28:57] place if time would
[1:28:59] tar amen we do our hunting we do things
[1:29:03] that we enjoy doing we all of these
[1:29:05] things but in the end guess what the
[1:29:08] ultimate outcoming would be a
[1:29:10] funeral is that
[1:29:18] right and we always we always think well
[1:29:23] it's somebody else it's somebody else
[1:29:24] but someday it hits
[1:29:26] you someday it comes to your
[1:29:29] door that ambulance that we hear
[1:29:31] screaming up and down the road one day
[1:29:34] it could be you could be you in
[1:29:37] there one of these days that Hearst
[1:29:40] going down the road it's not going to be
[1:29:41] somebody else goingon to be
[1:29:43] you
[1:29:45] amen praise the Lord but think about it
[1:29:48] and we realize that God allowed us to
[1:29:52] get into this situation
[1:29:54] through the prophet of God we even
[1:29:56] understand that he designed Eve as a
[1:29:59] byproduct ain't that right because he
[1:30:01] knew Adam wouldn't fall but he made a
[1:30:03] byproduct off of him and he knew before
[1:30:07] he ever made her that she would fall
[1:30:09] that's
[1:30:11] right
[1:30:14] amen oh boy this is get this is going to
[1:30:17] be a little meaty here but do you
[1:30:19] realize and I never knew it until the
[1:30:21] message of the hour that God that that
[1:30:23] even the angels that God created were on
[1:30:26] free moral
[1:30:28] agency they could choose whether they
[1:30:31] wanted to stay with God or they wanted
[1:30:33] to go with Lucifer and there was a big
[1:30:35] division in heaven two-thirds of the
[1:30:38] angels went with Lucifer is that right
[1:30:40] they were all cast out they made their
[1:30:42] choice so they were made and designed so
[1:30:44] that they could fall amen that's why we
[1:30:49] have Cancers and tuberculosis and suc
[1:30:51] diabetes and all these other demons
[1:30:54] they're devils in the Supernatural realm
[1:30:58] amen that's right we've got hatred and
[1:31:01] bitterness and envy and jealousy and all
[1:31:04] those things are
[1:31:05] demons hello that's right hatred like
[1:31:09] Cain did led to
[1:31:14] murder but I've got a scripture of Hope
[1:31:17] for you is that okay first I want to
[1:31:18] talk about the bad for a while is that
[1:31:20] all right but I'm going to I'm going to
[1:31:22] talk if I can here if I can find it
[1:31:24] right
[1:31:26] quick let me
[1:31:28] see it's either in Romans or
[1:31:36] Corinthians see the creature in Romans 8
[1:31:40] and2 says for the creature was made
[1:31:42] subject to
[1:31:44] vanity not willing you but by reason of
[1:31:48] him who has also subjected the same in
[1:31:51] hope in other words God allowed us to
[1:31:54] come into this place but God has also
[1:31:58] subjected us to
[1:32:03] Hope and I don't know sure just how I
[1:32:06] got
[1:32:07] it let me just read it the way I got it
[1:32:10] wrote down hopefully makes sense God
[1:32:12] that allowed us to get into this sming
[1:32:15] Burning dump so to speak this hell hole
[1:32:19] this terrible place this evil place how
[1:32:24] many knows this is Satan's eating now
[1:32:27] all kinds of evil and wicked things the
[1:32:29] god that allowed us to get into that
[1:32:31] place
[1:32:33] amen has also given us something that is
[1:32:38] greater than
[1:32:40] that there's something that's
[1:32:43] greater Paul said for I reckon that the
[1:32:46] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:32:49] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:32:52] that shall be revealed in US us this 60
[1:32:56] 70 80 years of suffering and so forth
[1:32:59] amen for the sake of Christ it's not
[1:33:02] worthy Paul and his suffering and all of
[1:33:04] his suffering he says all the suffering
[1:33:06] that he did how many knows Paul suffered
[1:33:09] a
[1:33:10] lot shipwreck Stripes imprisonments his
[1:33:14] head cut off hello but it says it's not
[1:33:17] to be compared with the glory that shall
[1:33:20] be revealed in
[1:33:22] US amen so all in all no matter how
[1:33:26] depressing it looks no how bad things
[1:33:28] are we still shout the glory of
[1:33:32] God we have our heads above it why
[1:33:35] because of God is greater than any of
[1:33:39] it
[1:33:43] amen
[1:33:51] amen I'll go ahead and say it since it
[1:33:54] comes to mind it's actually the end of
[1:33:56] my sermon but I'll go say this you say
[1:33:59] well what about death brother B what
[1:34:01] about when somebody isn't that such a
[1:34:03] horrible terrible thing as far as
[1:34:05] leaving and and and being absent from
[1:34:08] them
[1:34:08] people it's terrible
[1:34:11] thing but the Bible says how precious is
[1:34:14] the death of one of his children in
[1:34:17] God's eyes it's the best thing happened
[1:34:20] to
[1:34:21] him how many knows brother Brandon went
[1:34:23] beyond the curtain of time he shook
[1:34:25] their hands he hugged them and he seen
[1:34:26] them they were there they're really
[1:34:28] there that's right he says you know when
[1:34:30] he came back he says there's no words in
[1:34:33] the English vocabulary to describe to
[1:34:35] you how beautiful it is over there
[1:34:37] there's no old age There's No Tomorrow
[1:34:38] there's no yesterday there's no you know
[1:34:40] pretty good and good days and bad day
[1:34:42] it's absolute perfection and beyond that
[1:34:46] and so when it comes right down to it
[1:34:48] folks even the worst that you can think
[1:34:50] we know that beyond that last breath is
[1:34:53] a world that is beyond our comprehension
[1:34:57] awesome
[1:34:59] Amen so that's our hope that's our faith
[1:35:02] that's what we
[1:35:04] know amen why you think Paul could said
[1:35:07] oh death where is your sting oh grave
[1:35:09] where is your Victory EV Bosworth the
[1:35:11] different one says man who's dying here
[1:35:13] you or me play me some Snappy gospel
[1:35:15] song Oh down at the cross where my
[1:35:19] savior play me some Snappy songs why
[1:35:22] because they knew that going into the
[1:35:24] presence of God so now the Stinger of
[1:35:28] death has been taken out when you look
[1:35:31] at that in the right
[1:35:34] way you're doing good because the devil
[1:35:37] wants you to look at it in the wrong way
[1:35:39] is that right he sure does praise the
[1:35:42] Lord so we were born in this
[1:35:45] trap born in a terrible thing called our
[1:35:50] first nature
[1:35:58] huh but we were born with a nature
[1:36:01] that's even wrong something that how
[1:36:03] many knows you can fight it all you want
[1:36:05] to you can fight that nature all you
[1:36:07] want to but without the power of the
[1:36:10] Holy Spirit you'll never overcome
[1:36:15] it you can come to church and you can
[1:36:17] call yourself a Christian you take
[1:36:19] communion you can do all of those things
[1:36:21] but you're still going to go out there
[1:36:22] and cheat and lie and steal and
[1:36:23] everything else you're going to do
[1:36:25] things that's
[1:36:27] wrong why because it's your
[1:36:30] nature that's why we need a nature
[1:36:32] change the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:36:34] and joy and peace forgiveness
[1:36:36] longsuffering gentleness and all of
[1:36:37] those things Galatians 5 talks about the
[1:36:40] fruit of the flesh is emulation and
[1:36:42] wrath and strife and Sedition and
[1:36:44] adultery and all of hatred and variance
[1:36:47] and
[1:36:48] emulation terrible things nothing good
[1:36:51] about the nature of a flesh
[1:36:53] but God comes to change that amen so
[1:36:57] we're born in a
[1:36:58] trap amen now I want to go to our
[1:37:02] beginning scripture is that
[1:37:05] okay amen praise the Lord 1 Corinthians
[1:37:09] 10 1 Corinthians
[1:37:12] 10 this is what the Lord laid on my
[1:37:14] heart to speak on this
[1:37:22] morning if comes to me I'm just going to
[1:37:25] say it as it comes you know Jesus says
[1:37:28] you believe in God why don't you also
[1:37:31] believe in me ain't that right I want to
[1:37:34] say that this morning people say they
[1:37:36] believe Jesus Christ of yesterday why
[1:37:38] don't they believe the Jesus of today
[1:37:41] what God is doing
[1:37:42] today he says and even Jesus says unless
[1:37:45] you believe that I am he that was to
[1:37:47] come you'll die in your
[1:37:50] sins amen how many believ it's important
[1:37:53] to believe Jesus Christ in your hour in
[1:37:56] your day amen now in uh 1 Corinthians 10
[1:38:01] and verse 13 there has no temptation
[1:38:04] taken you but such as is common to man
[1:38:08] but God is faithful who will not suffer
[1:38:10] you to be tempted above that you are
[1:38:12] able but will with that Temptation also
[1:38:16] make a way of
[1:38:18] Escape praise the
[1:38:21] Lord hallelujah aren't you glad that God
[1:38:24] makes a way of
[1:38:26] Escape I believe it's in
[1:38:30] Hebrews Hebrews 2 chapter says therefore
[1:38:35] we ought to give the more Earnest to the
[1:38:37] things which we have heard least at any
[1:38:39] time we should let them slip for if we
[1:38:41] for if the word spoken by Angels was
[1:38:43] steadfast and every transgression and
[1:38:46] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:38:49] of reward how shall we escape
[1:38:55] amen if we neglect such a great
[1:38:57] salvation which at the first began to be
[1:39:00] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[1:39:02] unto us by them that heard
[1:39:06] them the third scripture of Escape is in
[1:39:10] second
[1:39:12] Peter second Peter 1 and verse4 whereby
[1:39:16] are given unto us exceeding great and
[1:39:19] precious promises how many believe
[1:39:21] that that's right
[1:39:24] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:39:26] of the age I'll never leave you nor will
[1:39:28] I forsake you whatever you ask in my
[1:39:31] name I will do
[1:39:32] it amen I say unto you that if you say
[1:39:36] to this mountain be plucked up and cast
[1:39:38] into the sea and if you doubt not it
[1:39:40] shall be
[1:39:42] done how many beli so many promises that
[1:39:45] if you ask anything in my name I will do
[1:39:50] it Lord help us to come up to that
[1:39:53] whatever you ask God I will do
[1:39:56] it why because how many believes we've
[1:39:59] been restored back to the in our spirit
[1:40:01] realm we've been restored back to the
[1:40:03] way that Adam was before the
[1:40:06] fall exceeding great and precious
[1:40:08] Promises by the that by these he might
[1:40:11] be partakers of the divine nature having
[1:40:15] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:40:17] world through lust amen so we have
[1:40:19] escaped there one place we've escaped
[1:40:22] amen
[1:40:23] the corruption that is in the
[1:40:26] world if you're a Christian this morning
[1:40:29] you have escaped so many
[1:40:34] things so many things to be a Christian
[1:40:38] means that you be
[1:40:39] Christlike to be filled with his holy
[1:40:46] spirit amen
[1:40:57] unless you are born again you cannot
[1:41:00] even see the kingdom of God Jesus said
[1:41:03] unless a man is born of water and of
[1:41:06] spirit Paul said he that hath not the
[1:41:09] spirit of God is none of his it takes a
[1:41:13] new birth of the Holy Spirit to change
[1:41:16] your nature to cause you to escape the
[1:41:20] corruption that is in the world I mean
[1:41:23] there's some real corruption out
[1:41:25] there I'm glad that I'm not governed by
[1:41:29] Satan this
[1:41:31] morning don't have to tattoo myself and
[1:41:34] paint all over myself and wear nose
[1:41:36] rings and eye rings and have orange hair
[1:41:38] and pink hair doesn't the devil just
[1:41:40] really paint him up good don't he go to
[1:41:43] Walmart and you got orange and green and
[1:41:45] pink hair and oh
[1:41:49] my you're on my if you're you're if
[1:41:52] you're man didn't get win the
[1:41:55] election just going crazy because
[1:41:58] somebody didn't win the election come on
[1:42:01] folks huh it's just
[1:42:05] sad
[1:42:10] amen
[1:42:12] Amen brother brand preached a message in
[1:42:15] 1956 making a way that's where I like
[1:42:18] got a lot of De thoughts from but my
[1:42:20] initial thought was this and that is
[1:42:22] that I want to say make a statement are
[1:42:25] you ready for
[1:42:26] this no matter what it
[1:42:29] is no matter what it is it don't matter
[1:42:34] like I said all the way to the door of
[1:42:37] death God makes a way of
[1:42:41] Escape if he' had just left us in this
[1:42:44] condition it had been a terrible way to
[1:42:45] have to live but no he has provided a
[1:42:48] way of
[1:42:49] Escape no matter what it is
[1:42:54] H and there's only two
[1:42:57] factions there's only two factions that
[1:43:01] governs
[1:43:04] everything that's Faith or
[1:43:09] doubt when you get into those traps when
[1:43:11] you get into those places you'll either
[1:43:12] be governed by
[1:43:14] fear or faith and I want you to
[1:43:18] understand something about God and that
[1:43:19] is God forces you to make a decision you
[1:43:25] have to pick one or the other just like
[1:43:28] you have to pick heaven or
[1:43:32] hell you have to God put it out there
[1:43:36] and he said whosoever will let him come
[1:43:39] you have to decide even the prophet of
[1:43:40] God said God isn't going to send you to
[1:43:42] hell you make the choice yourself of
[1:43:45] whether or not you're going to go to
[1:43:46] hell why because he put the pardon there
[1:43:49] if you don't accept it you're sending
[1:43:51] yourself there
[1:43:59] Amen in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:44:01] there's only two elements that you can
[1:44:03] be controlled by that's either Faith or
[1:44:06] doubt
[1:44:07] amen he says we've had Wars rumors of
[1:44:11] wars that's how the Earth stands today
[1:44:13] there'll be plenty more Wars but do you
[1:44:15] realize there's only two powers in the
[1:44:17] universe and all of our differences
[1:44:19] between the Nations difference between
[1:44:21] each other and everything
[1:44:23] all it all amounts to two Powers there's
[1:44:26] only two powers and two kingdoms amen
[1:44:29] and all of the rest of these little
[1:44:31] minor things are all connected to either
[1:44:33] one of those Powers that's Satan's power
[1:44:38] and God's
[1:44:40] power the power of Faith or the power of
[1:44:45] Doubt
[1:44:47] amen another
[1:44:49] one here he says there's only two
[1:44:51] elements in the world that control
[1:44:53] controls the world tonight that's fear
[1:44:54] and faith and I don't think I uh but on
[1:44:58] the other quote he says that's either
[1:45:00] fear or doubt and fear will accompany
[1:45:04] doubt how manyan knows it's ultimately
[1:45:06] fear and faith but doubt and fear
[1:45:09] always accompanies
[1:45:15] doubt
[1:45:17] amen if I doubt that Donna is going to
[1:45:21] live I could be very
[1:45:24] depressed when I think about her dying
[1:45:27] and me not being with her and so
[1:45:30] forth or it can be very
[1:45:32] depressing it could bring
[1:45:34] fear is that
[1:45:36] right bring fear and depression because
[1:45:40] that's what doubt does
[1:45:45] Amen so think about it doubt brings fear
[1:45:51] when I think about Adam how many knows
[1:45:54] Adam let's let's look a little bit with
[1:45:56] the help of the Lord on to two different
[1:45:59] things that
[1:46:00] uh doubt
[1:46:09] brings
[1:46:10] doubt
[1:46:13] amen will make you keep your
[1:46:19] condemnation how many know people that
[1:46:21] don't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:23] don't believe in the Forgiveness of sins
[1:46:26] don't believe in the remission of
[1:46:28] sins they don't believe the Lord they
[1:46:30] will keep their condemnation that's
[1:46:33] right they will always be condemned like
[1:46:36] Adam was and the first thing that
[1:46:38] happened even when Eve disbelieved the
[1:46:40] word look at what it brought fear death
[1:46:45] Adam willfully stepped out to save his
[1:46:47] wife and so forth and what did they find
[1:46:49] themselves doing hiding why hide because
[1:46:53] they were scared because they had fear
[1:46:56] that's the one thing that comes into
[1:46:58] each and everyone and I don't care even
[1:47:00] the prophet said he's been by many a
[1:47:02] person that has many brags and
[1:47:04] everything else and curse God and
[1:47:06] whatnot but when they come to ding they
[1:47:08] say could I have been wrong when it
[1:47:11] comes down to the door of death there's
[1:47:13] that fear that comes in and they realize
[1:47:15] they going out
[1:47:17] amen and fear come into Adam why because
[1:47:20] doubt was there but doubt has absolutely
[1:47:24] no virtue there's nothing good about
[1:47:25] fear or
[1:47:27] doubt butam says you know if I knew I
[1:47:29] was going to get shot tomorrow it
[1:47:31] wouldn't do me any good to be scared
[1:47:33] about it to worry about it fear and
[1:47:36] worry doesn't do anything for
[1:47:39] you but make it
[1:47:42] worse
[1:47:48] amen
[1:47:50] amen I think you I think yall have a lot
[1:47:53] of confidence in what I
[1:47:55] say because you know I talk from
[1:48:00] experience I talk from
[1:48:03] experience
[1:48:09] amen that was put on me it was forced on
[1:48:12] me it was forced on my wife it's forced
[1:48:14] on all of us what are you going to do
[1:48:17] which way you going to
[1:48:19] go amen and I thank God for his grace
[1:48:24] for his Mercy that in the midst of all
[1:48:27] that you can find the right way you can
[1:48:29] find the right thought and that is his
[1:48:31] thoughts not your thoughts and not the
[1:48:33] devil thoughts and I I'm here to tell
[1:48:35] you it brings you
[1:48:37] peace peace that passes
[1:48:40] understanding when the waves are coming
[1:48:43] when the ship is about to sink amen it's
[1:48:47] just like the disciples when they had to
[1:48:48] go back there and wake him up don't you
[1:48:50] care that we perish he up there and says
[1:48:53] oh ye of little faith how long will I
[1:48:56] suffer you he rebuked them can you
[1:48:58] imagine getting up they're about to
[1:49:01] drown amen where's your
[1:49:04] faith amen I'm here to tell you that
[1:49:07] there's God is still here that calms the
[1:49:10] storm he's still got power over the
[1:49:13] waves amen I want you to understand
[1:49:15] there's still an anchor that can hold
[1:49:17] that ship that the waves may come over
[1:49:20] may come around may come under but if
[1:49:22] it's anchor to that
[1:49:24] Rock
[1:49:26] Amen it ain't going
[1:49:29] nowhere it'll
[1:49:33] hold that's right praise be to
[1:49:39] God and I'm just going to go ahead and
[1:49:41] tell what comes to mind we have went all
[1:49:45] of us I we've went through a lot of hard
[1:49:50] things and God has brought us through
[1:49:52] all of those and he is taking us through
[1:49:55] this he is taking us through this thank
[1:49:57] you Jesus thank you
[1:50:04] Lord cuz he's the same yesterday today
[1:50:06] and forever and our faith and our
[1:50:09] confidence is in
[1:50:13] him but it does take Faith you got to
[1:50:17] believe how many believes that when that
[1:50:20] uh what was it I believe it was the man
[1:50:23] with the epileptic child came up to him
[1:50:26] he says if thou can't believe all things
[1:50:29] are possible I mean that boy was in a
[1:50:31] terrible State and God says if you can
[1:50:34] believe how many knows he's still saying
[1:50:36] the same thing to every one of us if you
[1:50:38] can believe all things are possible he's
[1:50:41] the same yesterday today and
[1:50:45] forever but there are those let me say
[1:50:49] this there are those who do not Escape
[1:50:51] there are those who do not not make
[1:50:54] it
[1:50:56] amen there are those who do not make it
[1:51:01] first of all I want to start out with
[1:51:02] this remember Jesus said go and sin no
[1:51:06] more when he would deliver somebody go
[1:51:08] and send no more or a worse thing come
[1:51:11] upon
[1:51:12] you you can lose your healing you can
[1:51:15] lose these things if your doubt goes
[1:51:17] down if you begin to have doubt and you
[1:51:20] don't believe it anymore guess what
[1:51:21] you'll lose it
[1:51:24] even as God might sanctify you and clean
[1:51:26] the house and get rid of the evil that
[1:51:28] you have but if you don't feel that up
[1:51:31] with something seven more Devils more
[1:51:33] evil than that one will come
[1:51:37] back what about the children of Israel
[1:51:39] how many they came they escaped Egypt
[1:51:42] right but they kept doubting they kept
[1:51:44] not believing in hard
[1:51:49] situations they let their faith dwindle
[1:51:52] God brought them up to that Red Sea
[1:51:54] isn't that right and they complained
[1:51:56] wasn't there enough Graves for us to be
[1:51:58] buried in in Egypt how many times say oh
[1:52:01] I wish I would have we we let's go back
[1:52:03] and go back to
[1:52:05] Egypt naan and C they
[1:52:08] doubted that Moses was called to be the
[1:52:11] leader he thought I ought to have a
[1:52:12] little bit in this leadership stuff it's
[1:52:15] not just a one man thing
[1:52:17] here no we're all holy we're all say go
[1:52:20] Moses was grieved God was so so grieve
[1:52:23] with them cuz they doubted God's calling
[1:52:25] of Moses did they escape
[1:52:30] no no they didn't they swallowed them up
[1:52:35] they
[1:52:36] died because they didn't
[1:52:39] believe so I in my study I come up with
[1:52:43] this conclusion it's dangerous it's
[1:52:46] deadly it's horrible it's dangerous to
[1:52:50] not believe
[1:52:52] amen ex very dangerous not to
[1:52:58] believe you'll send yourself to Hell by
[1:53:00] not believing you'll not be healed by
[1:53:03] not believing you'll not be saved by not
[1:53:09] believing
[1:53:11] amen God doesn't like that
[1:53:14] unbelief God sent us a prophet in this
[1:53:16] generation took his picture with it the
[1:53:18] pillar of fire very same Pillar of Fire
[1:53:21] that led the children of Israel amen did
[1:53:23] signs and wonders very same things he
[1:53:26] did millions of times Discerning the
[1:53:28] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:53:30] brother Brandon would have to wait till
[1:53:32] he comes oh you know who I'm waiting on
[1:53:34] and all of a sudden your name is from so
[1:53:35] and so the very same Messiah
[1:53:38] sign and people don't believe
[1:53:41] it people don't believe it on the day of
[1:53:43] judgment Jesus is going to say I did
[1:53:45] that world over challenged the Hindu
[1:53:47] Buddha 30,000 of them said any of
[1:53:50] your all of your gods come open this
[1:53:53] Blind Man's eyes and I'll have your
[1:53:55] relationship but if my Jesus will open
[1:53:57] it did all of that and they still won't
[1:53:59] believe he says we did that all for you
[1:54:03] amen but you wouldn't
[1:54:10] believe amen go ye into all the world
[1:54:13] Jesus said and demonstrate the gospel
[1:54:15] the power of the Gospel 12 people raised
[1:54:18] from the dead will people believe it no
[1:54:21] remember last when you know he he this
[1:54:25] this this rich man died went to hell and
[1:54:27] said man send somebody back from the
[1:54:29] dead send somebody back back from the
[1:54:31] dead and let them he said no if they
[1:54:33] don't believe the prophets they won't
[1:54:34] believe anybody even though they're
[1:54:35] raised from the dead God can graise
[1:54:38] people from the dead and they still
[1:54:39] don't
[1:54:40] believe man can't do that that's
[1:54:46] God and I thought M when I thought about
[1:54:48] doubt and what it
[1:54:50] does God keep me away from from
[1:54:53] doubt it'll bring depression CU see I've
[1:54:56] got wrote down here uh you know this
[1:54:59] condemnation brings fear fear brings a
[1:55:03] complex when you're scared of something
[1:55:05] you can't be the man that you're
[1:55:06] supposed to be you can't have confidence
[1:55:09] it brings
[1:55:13] inferiority is't that right you feel
[1:55:15] inferior and and you are
[1:55:18] inferior it brings weakness it brings
[1:55:21] feelings of worthless
[1:55:22] lessness you want to you're it's you
[1:55:26] you're scared you want to
[1:55:28] hide it brings
[1:55:32] unsur you're on sinking sand it brings
[1:55:35] sorrow and it brings
[1:55:38] depression many times it brings
[1:55:41] suicide people feel so worthless that's
[1:55:44] what doubt will
[1:55:46] do it'll keep your sin upon
[1:55:50] you amen
[1:55:54] condemnation
[1:55:56] my go ye into all the world and preach
[1:55:58] the gospel to Every Creature he that
[1:56:01] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:56:04] he that believeth not shall be
[1:56:08] damned there it is that's right so God
[1:56:11] says you know if you believe for God
[1:56:13] send his for God to love the world that
[1:56:16] he gave his only begotten son that
[1:56:17] whosoever should believe in him should
[1:56:19] not perish but have everlasting life for
[1:56:22] God sent not his son into the world to
[1:56:24] condemn the world but that the world
[1:56:26] through him might be
[1:56:27] saved there is your
[1:56:31] pardon you have that pardon now accept
[1:56:35] it or don't accept
[1:56:38] it decide which way you want to go
[1:56:42] decide where you want to spend eternity
[1:56:45] you have
[1:56:47] to once you hear the truth once you hear
[1:56:50] the gospel You're Not Innocent anymore
[1:56:55] God this morning service in my preaching
[1:56:57] is being recorded and it'll be played
[1:56:59] back on the day of judgment that's why
[1:57:02] it's so important that I say what the
[1:57:04] Bible
[1:57:05] says what God has Vindicated and proven
[1:57:08] to be true amen or I'll be judged I will
[1:57:12] have to give an
[1:57:13] account you see where we're
[1:57:16] at amen it's dangerous to doubt man if
[1:57:21] you would have just realized how
[1:57:23] dangerous it was to flirt with that
[1:57:26] serpent she'd have smacked him like a
[1:57:28] good woman does flirting with a somebody
[1:57:30] that ought to be flirting with I just
[1:57:32] thought about that you like that iing
[1:57:34] about picture of
[1:57:35] it smack him get away from
[1:57:39] me stay away from me don't you even
[1:57:42] come don't come anywhere close to
[1:57:45] me I mean that's what you and I ought to
[1:57:47] be saying don't don't you come anywhere
[1:57:49] close to me don't you try to get up in
[1:57:51] my mind and make me doubt cuz that's
[1:57:53] what he does and he's a good guy at it
[1:57:55] try to make you
[1:57:58] doubt by your own reasoning your own
[1:58:01] thinking watch your own thinking it
[1:58:03] better be the way that God
[1:58:09] thinks
[1:58:11] amen praise the Lord you've got to give
[1:58:13] things up folks you got to give your own
[1:58:16] ways up got to give your own thinking up
[1:58:18] your own ideas up amen
[1:58:23] what does it say lean not to your own
[1:58:28] understanding my my my that's right he
[1:58:33] that believeth not just that
[1:58:36] simple sends your soul to hell because
[1:58:38] you don't believe that's dangerous
[1:58:40] that's not something that we want to do
[1:58:49] amen I looked up on
[1:58:52] theory about
[1:58:54] penicillin where it come
[1:58:57] from some kind of
[1:59:00] mold I'm out it's some kind of
[1:59:07] mold amen
[1:59:10] menitis and a few other things a bunch
[1:59:13] of stuff that that's good for is that
[1:59:15] right that'll
[1:59:18] cure but before they could find that how
[1:59:20] many knows those
[1:59:23] medical science or what do they call
[1:59:25] them chemists I
[1:59:28] guess what they'll do is they'll go out
[1:59:30] and they'll find out try to find Roots
[1:59:33] they'll find they'll just try about
[1:59:36] everything I mean who have thought let's
[1:59:39] get some terrible mold that'll kill you
[1:59:41] and let's find out if we can get a cure
[1:59:42] out of
[1:59:46] it even prophet of God says you know you
[1:59:48] go to praying for a for a a disease an
[1:59:52] antidote you might get
[1:59:54] one they do that why to try to cure
[2:00:01] different diseases different
[2:00:04] sicknesses I don't know about you but
[2:00:06] praise God for
[2:00:08] Tylenol praise God for
[2:00:11] aspirin praise God for everything
[2:00:13] medicine all of medicine that they've
[2:00:15] been able to come up with and make you
[2:00:17] feel
[2:00:18] better that's
[2:00:20] right but you know they say that they'll
[2:00:23] take these chemistry and they'll take a
[2:00:24] a rat or something and inject that rat
[2:00:26] with it is that
[2:00:31] right and see how they do see how they
[2:00:35] react put the sickness on them first and
[2:00:37] then see if it works and if it
[2:00:40] works amen even Trump has allowed stuff
[2:00:45] that hasn't really been proven right but
[2:00:49] if a person is terminal go ahead and try
[2:00:51] it
[2:00:53] right can't
[2:00:55] lose you know it might just
[2:00:59] help but you know they've come up with
[2:01:01] vaccines for things we thank God for
[2:01:04] those
[2:01:05] vaccines you and I needed a
[2:01:08] vaccine from this nature of sin that
[2:01:11] we're
[2:01:13] in from our
[2:01:18] depression from the things that tear us
[2:01:20] apart
[2:01:23] from
[2:01:24] grumbling from
[2:01:26] complaining from not getting along for
[2:01:29] being hateful
[2:01:31] [Music]
[2:01:32] mean
[2:01:35] hello why because we ain't got peace in
[2:01:37] our
[2:01:38] heart
[2:01:40] amen and how many knows God one
[2:01:44] day looked down from
[2:01:47] heaven saw his
[2:01:49] son ain't that right
[2:01:52] and he injected the spirit into Jesus
[2:01:56] cuz he came down like a dove and landed
[2:01:59] on him he injected him with something
[2:02:03] and I'm here to tell you when he come to
[2:02:04] Matthew 4 he was up on the mountain of
[2:02:07] the devil tempted him in every
[2:02:10] manner amen he got sined and the
[2:02:13] inoculation
[2:02:15] hell when he come up the demons when he
[2:02:18] come up the epilepsy when he come up the
[2:02:20] blind people it's would he come up to
[2:02:22] any kind ofbody like that woman at the
[2:02:24] well with the blood issue just touch him
[2:02:28] that inoculation was
[2:02:30] good how many's glad for
[2:02:33] that amen then he went on the ramp parts
[2:02:36] of glory amen let me say this first of
[2:02:38] all and then but he wanted to get the
[2:02:40] ultimate
[2:02:42] serum why because even though he had
[2:02:45] it you couldn't have
[2:02:48] it he could heal you but you really
[2:02:51] didn't have power to heal others you
[2:02:54] couldn't lay your hands on somebody else
[2:02:55] and give them the Holy Ghost cuz you
[2:02:57] didn't have the Holy Ghost hello but he
[2:03:01] went to
[2:03:02] Calvary that's why we promote Calvary
[2:03:05] that's why we promote the cross of Jesus
[2:03:07] Christ cuz when he died he said it is
[2:03:11] finished the prescription has been
[2:03:14] wrote go ye into all World baptizing
[2:03:17] them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:03:18] Christ for the remission of their sin
[2:03:21] that right Father Son and the Holy Ghost
[2:03:22] is with Jesus Christ and they shall
[2:03:25] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:27] the promise is to you to your
[2:03:30] children let me stop for a minute when
[2:03:34] God does something he's not like us he
[2:03:38] doesn't have to advance he doesn't have
[2:03:39] to get better he doesn't have to improve
[2:03:41] on it and has never needed to
[2:03:46] improve isn't it something how our
[2:03:48] doctors of divinity in our Bible schools
[2:03:50] tried to tell the muhammads and
[2:03:52] different ones that Mark 16 from a
[2:03:54] certain verse on down amen well that
[2:03:56] wasn't
[2:03:57] inspired they're trying to make the
[2:03:59] inoculation no
[2:04:01] good but they can't never make it no
[2:04:04] good no matter how the much they doubt
[2:04:06] no matter how much they
[2:04:09] disbelieve amen it's still good
[2:04:12] today you repent be baptized in the name
[2:04:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[2:04:17] remission of your sins and you shall
[2:04:19] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the
[2:04:21] promise is to you to your children my
[2:04:24] grandchildren to them that are far off
[2:04:27] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:04:32] call amen aren't you glad that if you oh

[2:04:37] blues we'd have to drink and smoke and

[2:09:24] greatest battle in the Garden of
[2:09:26] Gethsemane between God's will and his
[2:09:29] will even Jesus when he was facing death
[2:09:32] said if it be
[2:09:34] possible even
[2:09:36] Jesus let it pass from
[2:09:40] me so
[2:09:42] hard but yet he said
[2:09:45] nevertheless not my
[2:09:47] will but thy will be done that's for
[2:09:51] every believer how many believes that's
[2:09:53] for all of us amen that's right amen
[2:09:58] it's always the sweet will of God praise
[2:10:02] be to God you love him this morning
[2:10:06] amen that's right God makes a way for
[2:10:11] the
[2:10:12] believer can't say that always how many
[2:10:15] let me say this how many knows that God
[2:10:17] was merciful to the Israelites ain't
[2:10:20] that right now to daythan and car to
[2:10:23] Dayan he wasn't very merciful when Dayan
[2:10:26] rose up and all of those princes and
[2:10:28] everybody rose up with him ain't that
[2:10:30] right Moses said you bring your incense
[2:10:33] you bring your incense to the the temple
[2:10:36] and we're going to see who God has
[2:10:38] received and who hasn't is that
[2:10:41] right and after that we found out that
[2:10:44] God didn't give him another chance he
[2:10:46] opened up the Earth and swallowed him
[2:10:49] up but with all of the israelit when God
[2:10:52] wanted to just SW wipe them all off he
[2:10:55] says just separate yourself from them
[2:10:58] Moses and Moses was a Jesus and he stood
[2:11:00] in breach no Lord people say he wasn't
[2:11:04] able to deliver and so forth before you
[2:11:07] them take my life how many times that
[2:11:10] God was merciful to Israel even with
[2:11:13] their
[2:11:16] doubt even with their doubt God was
[2:11:19] merciful
[2:11:21] But
[2:11:22] ultimately we understand that it was
[2:11:25] only their children that went in when
[2:11:28] they doubt it for the last time at ktie
[2:11:31] Baria God said that's
[2:11:33] it go back out into the Wilderness and
[2:11:36] they all went back into that Wilderness
[2:11:38] until they were all dead all those
[2:11:41] people that doubt it were all dead two
[2:11:44] million that's pretty strong
[2:11:48] folks but they didn't make it
[2:11:51] let me tell you something that's how
[2:11:53] dangerous doubt
[2:11:55] is when we come to the Judgment bar up
[2:11:58] there if you disbelieve trust me it'll
[2:12:00] show on that day God will show it in Box
[2:12:05] Car size letter the thoughts that went
[2:12:06] through your mind what you did with the
[2:12:09] word of
[2:12:10] God Amen this generation of Pentecostal
[2:12:16] Baptist methodists Catholics every kind
[2:12:19] that saw the manifestation of Jesus
[2:12:22] Christ 10 times greater than the book of
[2:12:25] Acts and they still walked
[2:12:28] away judgment's going to be bad for him
[2:12:31] it's going to be a bad day for him
[2:12:34] because brother Braham says my tape
[2:12:35] those tapes will be played back because
[2:12:36] that's not me but that's Jesus Christ
[2:12:39] Ministry they'll be played back on the
[2:12:41] day of
[2:12:42] judgment
[2:12:45] amen
[2:12:47] amen whenever brother brandom is praying
[2:12:49] for somebody with cancer or or sick
[2:12:52] person now raise your hands you don't
[2:12:53] know how many times me and my wife will
[2:12:55] raise our hands and now get up on your
[2:12:56] feet for laying on the bed we'll stand
[2:12:58] on our feet why do we do that because
[2:13:01] brother brandham said that even after
[2:13:03] I'm gone these tapes they will live
[2:13:06] on they will live on why are they're
[2:13:10] still alive the word of God is still the
[2:13:13] [Applause]
[2:13:14] TR amen if you can believe it amen
[2:13:18] somebody made a comment about that
[2:13:20] Pillar of Fire and God healed a't that
[2:13:22] right that's right made a negative
[2:13:25] confession about it and also got a
[2:13:27] damnation for it that's right God knows
[2:13:30] the motive and objective he knows our
[2:13:32] hearts thoughts and intents of our heart
[2:13:36] I'm going to try to close
[2:13:38] here with Paul's description of those
[2:13:41] who believe
[2:13:42] not in uh 1 Corinthians
[2:13:46] 10 moreover Brethren I would not have
[2:13:48] you to be
[2:13:49] ignorant that not all of our father that
[2:13:52] all of our fathers were under the cloud
[2:13:53] they all passed through the sea amen
[2:13:56] everybody claims to believe in Jesus
[2:13:59] everybody claim to be a Christian they
[2:14:01] were all baptized unto Moses in the
[2:14:03] cloud and the Sea they didn't all eat
[2:14:05] the same spiritual meat they all drank
[2:14:07] from the Spain spiritual rock that
[2:14:10] followed them and that rock was
[2:14:12] Christ oh I'd love to preach a little
[2:14:14] bit on that how many of knows when they
[2:14:16] were so thirsty they were about to dry
[2:14:18] up God didn't have a little spring
[2:14:21] springing up out of some soft sand
[2:14:23] somewhere no he had water to come on a
[2:14:26] hard
[2:14:29] rock God can do anything praise the Lord
[2:14:33] but with many of them God was not
[2:14:35] pleased because they were overthrown in
[2:14:36] the wilderness because they believe not
[2:14:39] now these things were our examples to
[2:14:41] the intent that you should not lust
[2:14:42] after evil things as they also lusted
[2:14:45] don't be idolators as some of them also
[2:14:48] were the people sat uh down to eat and
[2:14:51] to drink when they rose up the play and
[2:14:54] neither let us commit fornication as
[2:14:55] some of them committed and fell in one
[2:14:57] day 20 and
[2:14:59] 3,000 amen and don't murmur how many
[2:15:02] know when they were murmuring the snakes
[2:15:04] come and bit them they're complaining
[2:15:07] and they're
[2:15:09] murmuring woo like I said Wednesday Papa
[2:15:11] a hard God sometimes you want to cry and
[2:15:14] you want to complain maybe because of
[2:15:15] the hard times you go through amen God
[2:15:19] doesn't want you to murmur and to
[2:15:21] complain he wants you to believe him
[2:15:25] amen all the things and they were
[2:15:28] destroyed of Destroyer now all these
[2:15:30] things happen unto them for in samples
[2:15:32] and they are written for our admiss
[2:15:34] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[2:15:36] world are
[2:15:37] come boy oh boy so to speak aren't we at
[2:15:42] the ends of the world yeah we're at the
[2:15:45] ends of the world and we've got all of
[2:15:46] these examples when God does something
[2:15:49] believe him don't doubt
[2:15:51] no matter what comes your way don't
[2:15:53] doubt don't falter don't walk
[2:15:56] away don't run don't quit but
[2:16:00] believe amen Lord help us to be people
[2:16:04] of Faith how many want to say Lord don't
[2:16:06] get me around don't let me get around
[2:16:07] that dangerous thing called doubt or
[2:16:10] unbelief don't let it enter in my
[2:16:14] mind immediately cast it
[2:16:17] off amen and then all things are POS
[2:16:21] possible your
[2:16:22] salvation
[2:16:25] Deliverance let me close with this once
[2:16:29] again no matter
[2:16:33] what the sickness
[2:16:35] is sin sickness depression no matter
[2:16:40] what it is how many believes God has an
[2:16:44] escape for
[2:16:45] you he makes a way of Escape for you
[2:16:50] amen amen this just comes to me but even
[2:16:53] brother Braham says aren't you glad
[2:16:55] there is such a thing as
[2:16:57] death you see these old people and and
[2:17:00] and they just just the quality of life
[2:17:02] just just just barely they're just about
[2:17:05] dead huh I don't know about you but when
[2:17:08] I get to that place I don't want to do
[2:17:10] that for another 50 years okay just just
[2:17:12] let me go on you
[2:17:14] know that's right why to take you out of
[2:17:16] this pest house and give you a brand new
[2:17:19] body
[2:17:21] how glad oh man how glad that even the
[2:17:24] Bible says if this Earthly Tabernacle if
[2:17:26] this house is disolved M it's already
[2:17:28] got an escape you ain't got to wander
[2:17:30] out there in the regions of the Lost no
[2:17:33] you escape the regions of the lost and
[2:17:35] enter into your new
[2:17:36] body he's got a new house for you brand
[2:17:41] new amen we're so thankful for
[2:17:44] that that no matter what comes we're in
[2:17:47] the great Shepherd's hands stand with me
[2:17:50] this morning Amen Brother David I'd like
[2:17:52] to sing that way maker song if we could
[2:17:54] at least that one if you
[2:17:56] could amen if you know
[2:18:01] how let's bow our heads how many beli
[2:18:04] that Jesus is
[2:18:07] here he's in your heart he's in my heart
[2:18:11] anybody that's in here that's a genuine
[2:18:14] Christian has Jesus in their heart for I
[2:18:18] will be with you even in you to the end
[2:18:23] of the
[2:18:26] world now take a moment and think of
[2:18:32] what you need Deliverance or an escape
[2:18:34] from think of what your need is this
[2:18:43] morning Paul said my God shall supply
[2:18:47] all your need according to his riches in
[2:18:52] Christ
[2:18:53] Jesus think about that need if you have
[2:18:55] a hand you want to raise up say God you
[2:18:57] know what I in need
[2:19:02] of I don't know about you but if I
[2:19:05] wouldn't have anything else I would say
[2:19:07] Lord more of you Lord I want more of you
[2:19:12] father Lord Deliver us all help us all
[2:19:15] to escape from our first
[2:19:19] nature and let the second man rule let
[2:19:22] the first man be dead and the second one
[2:19:24] man have have to preeminence so to speak
[2:19:27] the white dog let him be fed so much
[2:19:29] until the black dog is starved to death
[2:19:32] Lord you see the hands that are up they
[2:19:35] defy gravity and they rais their hands
[2:19:37] to you and you see that hand you see
[2:19:40] that heart you see the mind you see what
[2:19:43] they're asking for just now
[2:19:45] Lord and help them to believe right now
[2:19:48] God that it's their possession it's
[2:19:50] their property that you paid for on
[2:19:53] Calvary it would be an insult for us not
[2:19:56] to accept our healing it would be an
[2:19:58] insult for us not to accept our
[2:20:00] Salvation when he died for it when he
[2:20:03] went and paid the ultimate price for us
[2:20:06] so now we accept Lord Jesus every
[2:20:08] promise in the book is mine every
[2:20:11] chapter every verse every line Lord
[2:20:15] continue to refine us continue to mold
[2:20:18] us and shape us into your image for we
[2:20:21] know that soon you're coming God and
[2:20:25] you're going to help us to escape this
[2:20:27] world by giving us a body
[2:20:31] change we're going to escape this
[2:20:33] tribulation
[2:20:35] period by what we believe to be the
[2:20:38] Rapture will be changed in the moment in
[2:20:41] the twinkling of an eye at the last
[2:20:42] Trump we which are alive and remain
[2:20:46] shall be CAU up together to meet them in
[2:20:50] the air care and so shall we ever be
[2:20:54] with the Lord When We Get Over Yonder

[2:21:01] honor and glory and power and strength
