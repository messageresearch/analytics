[0:56] luke
[0:57] eight
[0:58] uh
[1:01] and uh we'll begin with uh verse
[1:07] 43 to 48.
[1:22] uh
[1:37] and a woman having an issue of blood in
[1:40] 12 years which had spent all
[1:43] her living upon physicians neither could
[1:46] be healed of any came behind in him and
[1:49] touched the border of his garment and
[1:51] immediately
[1:52] her issue of blood stains
[1:55] and and jesus said who touched me
[1:58] when all denied
[2:00] peter and they that were with him said
[2:02] master the multitude thronged thee and
[2:05] pressed thee and says thou who touched
[2:07] me and jesus said
[2:09] somebody had touched me for i perceived
[2:12] that virtue has gone out of me
[2:14] and when the woman saw that she she was
[2:16] not hid she came trembling and falling
[2:19] down before him she declared unto him
[2:22] before all the
[2:23] people for for what caused since she had
[2:26] touched him and and how how she was
[2:29] healed immediately
[2:31] and he said unto her daughter be of good
[2:34] comfort thy faith hath made me whole go
[2:37] on peace
[2:39] may god has blessing to read the word
[2:41] you can receive it
[2:48] amen what what i would
[2:50] what the title of my service is
[2:53] uh making a move for god
[2:56] see
[2:57] because um
[3:00] she it was in in that
[3:01] condition to where
[3:04] she was either going to
[3:07] potentially die from her condition
[3:10] she got to that place where she was in
[3:13] in desperation that she needed something
[3:16] from the lord
[3:17] and
[3:19] and so
[3:20] um
[3:22] what what brother branham said about
[3:25] this is um
[3:28] up up on the hill
[3:31] said a woman knitting
[3:32] i wonder what's all the discouragement
[3:35] all the upset about down there she
[3:38] looked down
[3:39] some of them said you know that healer
[3:42] he's he's come to our town that
[3:45] that's him down there don't don't go
[3:47] down
[3:48] now but but the poor little woman had a
[3:51] blood issue for many years she sold all
[3:53] she had give it to the doctors and none
[3:56] of them could help her they couldn't
[3:58] stop the issue of blood she
[4:00] if that man is the son of god who who
[4:03] claims and to he he claims to be
[4:06] i won't have to have him him to pray for
[4:09] me i'll go down there and just touch the
[4:12] border of his garment and i'll get well
[4:14] that's right i'll just
[4:17] touch his garment and i'll i'll be well
[4:19] in other words if i can make some kind
[4:22] of contact i'll get well
[4:24] and i i see her coming pale face
[4:26] withered up and uh later knitting down
[4:29] and here she comes down the hill there
[4:31] there stood the priest saying where are
[4:33] you going
[4:35] i'm going to meet this man jesus
[4:37] do you realize that will put you out of
[4:39] the church i don't care in a way she
[4:42] went right right on through them
[4:45] here's
[4:46] another man saying do you know that the
[4:48] days of
[4:49] miracles is past don't you know i'm a
[4:52] teacher of the scripture
[4:54] we haven't had miracles since the death
[4:56] of the last prophet well we don't we
[4:58] don't have no miracles them days has
[5:00] passed moses
[5:02] did miracles but this guy is just a
[5:04] fanatic it's just a bunch of psychology
[5:07] that's all it is
[5:09] i can just see here that they said yeah
[5:11] you cannot go
[5:13] i can and see her ducking her little
[5:14] head down
[5:15] and just crawl between their legs and go
[5:18] right on anyhow she she wanted to get to
[5:21] jesus and she said if i can get to him
[5:24] i'll touch him and i'll get well that
[5:26] that's it that's something and in a way
[5:29] she went and
[5:31] jesus everybody around him him like that
[5:34] and she crawled up behind him and she
[5:37] she touched his garment and then and
[5:39] when she touched his garment
[5:41] he stopped looked around over the
[5:44] audience something happened
[5:46] he's the same yesterday today and
[5:47] forever he will do the same same thing
[5:50] here just touch him one time and see
[5:54] looked around said
[5:55] daughter thy faith has made thee whole
[5:57] amen and this is not hid it's in the
[6:00] bible see thy faith has saved me and the
[6:03] woman and felt in her body that the
[6:05] blood issue had stained had stopped
[6:08] see that's what what it takes sometimes
[6:11] god will bring you down down to such a
[6:13] low uh in in every
[6:15] uh
[6:17] generation and every time there's always
[6:19] been
[6:20] when things are going all well it's just
[6:22] like we don't really need god let's just
[6:25] just um let's just
[6:27] do whatever we want do whatever we
[6:29] please same with what what israel did is
[6:33] when
[6:35] they
[6:36] um
[6:37] things were going really really well and
[6:39] then um and then uh they were like
[6:42] all right then you know they started and
[6:44] you know starting to
[6:46] slowly get away from god and then when
[6:48] they when they did and they went to
[6:50] other gods and so forth
[6:52] they
[6:54] got god um
[6:57] he he sent an army to to take over and
[7:00] the king
[7:02] took over and and 18 years later they
[7:04] finally got themselves together and
[7:06] cried out to god
[7:08] and and and when they cried out
[7:11] god
[7:12] came and answered their prayer and send
[7:15] his prophet to go and kill the king
[7:19] and and so so it took that time of
[7:22] desperation that time of
[7:24] whether they needed something
[7:26] for from god for them to finally reach
[7:29] out it took him 18 years to realize they
[7:31] needed that but but
[7:34] but then they realized what is what had
[7:36] happened to them and they were
[7:40] they were
[7:41] god's servants at one time then they
[7:43] drifted away and then and then god had
[7:44] to send hard times to bring them back to
[7:47] him
[7:49] god never left them
[7:50] he just
[7:52] he just simply
[7:53] a um
[7:55] let them be overthrown by an enemy let
[7:57] them them see where they're at let them
[8:00] get down to the lowest valley and then
[8:02] and then realize
[8:03] oh
[8:04] i i know what what
[8:06] we've done they all of a sudden realize
[8:08] where they're at and what condition
[8:10] they're into to where they they get to
[8:12] that state of repentance and they turn
[8:14] from their ways and cry out to god
[8:16] for his help once again
[8:21] and um
[8:24] and so oh yeah it takes
[8:28] sometimes it takes desperation it takes
[8:31] being in a
[8:32] a bad place to to where
[8:35] you actually get in in desperation for
[8:38] god
[8:44] i think
[8:45] that
[8:46] if things are always going well
[8:48] and and we begin to to go through a
[8:51] this nation and it went through really
[8:54] hard times it went through
[8:57] absolute um i mean went through wars and
[9:00] and then we got this great nation we
[9:02] fought for this nation and everything
[9:04] but then then we started taking it for
[9:06] granted we say look at all the this
[9:08] goods that everything's good and then
[9:10] and then we we begin to get soft and and
[9:12] we get a generation that
[9:14] that is is
[9:16] so so weak
[9:18] and and it becomes getting weaker i i
[9:20] read this quote a while back
[9:24] it says um
[9:26] let me just find it here real quick
[9:29] tough times create strong men strong men
[9:32] create easy times easy times create weak
[9:35] men
[9:35] weak men create tough times
[9:38] and that that is is true it's not always
[9:42] true in every sense because some people
[9:43] get weak in tough times
[9:45] and and give up
[9:47] but but in general that that's kind of
[9:49] how it is
[9:50] and
[9:51] and that's what where this nation is
[9:53] getting to to a place where
[9:56] uh uh it goes way down and crashes on
[9:59] and then once everything gets to to the
[10:01] worst point where it's in the
[10:03] in the valley of um
[10:06] desolation or whatever then they start
[10:08] crying out uh god save us god
[10:11] and and it has happened in in many a uh
[10:14] different civilizations i would say in
[10:17] sodom and gomorrah as the flames fell
[10:20] they were all crying out and repenting
[10:23] and everything else but it's too late
[10:26] and and that's what what and what's
[10:28] going to happen they can't hide
[10:29] themselves under underneath the rocks
[10:33] that the bible says they'll try to hide
[10:34] themselves in their rocks from from god
[10:36] the one that they took out of school is
[10:38] the one that they took
[10:40] out of everything and foresay it forsook
[10:43] god because of a time of of pleasure and
[10:46] good things that that we got right now
[10:48] sure we got it's starting to go downhill
[10:50] right now that's
[10:52] because
[10:53] because he got president doesn't it
[10:54] nobody know what he's doing
[10:56] but
[10:58] but but yeah that that's that's kind of
[11:00] what happens in in every single
[11:02] generation and
[11:04] and i didn't think i was going to start
[11:05] out this way but
[11:07] but here we are anyways
[11:11] there's there's another uh i have quite
[11:14] a few verses here um let's see
[11:21] oh yeah this was actually the main one i
[11:22] was going to go off of it it's a quite
[11:25] long one it's luke 7 if you want to go
[11:27] to it in verse 37 and 50.
[11:30] and and behold a woman in the city which
[11:33] was a sinner and when she she knew that
[11:35] jesus and me in the pharisees house
[11:37] brought an alabaster box appointment and
[11:39] she stood at his feet behind him weeping
[11:42] and began to wash his feet with tears
[11:44] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[11:46] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[11:49] them with the ointment now when the
[11:51] pharaoh in him saw it he spake within
[11:54] himself saying this man if he were a
[11:57] prophet would have known who and what
[12:00] manner of woman this is that touched and
[12:03] toucheth him
[12:05] for she is the sinner and jesus answered
[12:07] it and said and unto him simon i have
[12:10] somewhat to say unto thee and he said
[12:12] master say on and there there was a
[12:15] certain creditor which had two debtors
[12:18] the one owed 500 pence and the other 50
[12:22] and when they had nothing to pay he
[12:25] frankly forgave them both
[12:27] tell me therefore which of them will
[12:29] love him the most
[12:31] simon answered and said i suppose that
[12:33] he to whom he forgave the most
[12:36] and he said and until now has rightly
[12:38] judged and he turned to the woman and
[12:40] said unto simon see style this woman i
[12:43] entered unto the thy thine house that
[12:46] gave us me no water for my feet but she
[12:49] hath washed my feet with tears and wiped
[12:51] them with the hairs of her head she she
[12:54] gave us me no no
[12:56] thou gave us me no kiss but
[12:59] this woman since the time i came and had
[13:03] not ceased to kiss my feet my head went
[13:06] with oil thou didst not anoint but this
[13:08] woman have anointed my feet with
[13:10] ointment wherefore say unto thee her
[13:12] sins which are many are forgiven for she
[13:15] loved much but to whom little is
[13:17] forgiven the same loveth little and and
[13:20] he said unto her
[13:22] thy sins are forgiven and they that sat
[13:25] and meet with him begin to say within
[13:27] themselves who is this that forgiveth
[13:29] sins also and he said to the woman thy
[13:32] faith has safety go in peace
[13:34] see
[13:35] this one this woman she she she was in
[13:38] such a bad state she she was
[13:41] brother brandon said that
[13:43] she was
[13:45] a prostitute and and she she was the
[13:47] worst center in the in the building and
[13:49] she
[13:50] but but she has something in her heart
[13:52] she's seen jesus with his
[13:55] his feet unwashed and with a filth
[14:00] filthy feet you can imagine how filthy
[14:02] it was as that's what what brother
[14:04] brandon said it and with his feet all
[14:06] right really dirty and everything and
[14:08] she she used it was her hair which which
[14:11] was her her only glory that she had
[14:16] because she hadn't had really long hair
[14:18] but
[14:19] but but even even though no one else
[14:22] else knew who this man is she recognized
[14:25] who who
[14:27] he
[14:28] who he is and and and so
[14:32] uh oh sh she
[14:33] she did and she was standing there all
[14:35] scared and
[14:38] and she she didn't know what he was
[14:40] going to do tell him and tell her that
[14:44] um
[14:45] shout out her to leave or whatever and
[14:49] and yet yet she she still made that move
[14:51] even though she was scared she had a lot
[14:53] of fear and i could imagine and
[14:57] how scary that would be this man that
[14:59] you know is a prophet and you just
[15:01] uh or she recognized to be a prophet and
[15:04] and she it goes in
[15:06] and and does that at forum and not even
[15:09] knowing
[15:11] and um
[15:12] how his reaction was going to be
[15:19] now uh
[15:20] what uh i was gonna i'm gonna read here
[15:23] what um yeah here it is what brother
[15:25] brandon said about this and and she
[15:27] rushed in real quick went went and got
[15:29] that alabaster box for oil probably had
[15:32] bought it
[15:33] with the money from her prostitution but
[15:35] what was it she she might have thought
[15:38] he is a
[15:39] he is a prophet but i remember another
[15:42] woman in my effects another character
[15:43] like mine she had the opportunity and
[15:45] she recognized him and she was forgiven
[15:48] up there there at the uh well of uh
[15:51] sideshow
[15:52] uh if i'm pronouncing it right
[15:54] last night we talked of it in it
[15:58] and if
[16:00] i can only get to him i know who he is
[16:04] i'll do him a service if the the rest of
[16:07] them i don't i don't care what what they
[16:09] do i'll do him a service i'll recognize
[16:12] he's the son of god and and that's
[16:14] exactly what what she did she she run in
[16:17] she got real close to him she felt so
[16:20] guilty that's the way a real dependent
[16:23] penitent and sinner feels in his
[16:26] presence guilty
[16:28] and and the tears begin to fall and and
[16:31] she was trying to hide them they they
[16:33] dropped on his feet she was going to
[16:36] annoy him but the tears dropped me on
[16:38] his feet and she she began to wipe them
[16:40] in and crying and and wiping them with
[16:43] their hands and and his
[16:46] feet was all getting uh
[16:52] forgive me if i pronounce this wrong
[16:54] mused up with the the dirt
[16:56] that that was on it and and if if you
[16:59] want to really believe it with the stink
[17:01] of the animals off the trail everyone
[17:02] walked the same trail and there there
[17:04] was a stink on him sitting there and her
[17:07] tears were dropping on his feet and she
[17:09] was trying to wipe them off and and she
[17:11] had no towel
[17:14] what what is the woman's beauty and
[17:15] honor is your hair that's the reason
[17:18] many of you women today cut it all off
[17:20] that's wrong
[17:22] she she took her hair and began to wash
[17:25] the
[17:26] his feet and wipe them her her pretty
[17:29] hair taking the stink off of him and
[17:32] upon herself bearing his reproach oh my
[17:35] that that's
[17:36] when you recognize who is in your
[17:38] presidency our sisters would have to
[17:41] almost stand on their head to get enough
[17:43] hair to do that
[17:45] so so there she she washed his feet and
[17:48] wiped them with the hairs of her head
[17:50] and she kissed his feet and that old
[17:52] simon standing back there said
[17:55] uh
[17:56] oh i can and just see him blow up he
[18:00] didn't recognize who he was said i told
[18:02] and told you he wasn't a prophet if he
[18:05] he was a prophet he would recognize that
[18:08] what kind of woman that is around him
[18:11] jesus never moved
[18:13] a foot
[18:14] he he just watched her and she was
[18:16] scared
[18:18] then after he had got through
[18:22] she doing the service to him she she
[18:24] looked over said simon
[18:25] i've got something to say to you you
[18:27] invited me here you brought me here in
[18:28] other words a trump update
[18:31] a trump upper sleeve you you wanted to
[18:34] show me off you wanted to prove that i
[18:36] wasn't what i am and you
[18:39] when you brought me here you should have
[18:41] had and my feet washed but you never you
[18:44] you shouldn't give me oil to anoint my
[18:47] head but you didn't you never kissed me
[18:49] welcome and this woman ever since i've
[18:52] been here has washed my feet with her
[18:55] tears and wiped them with their hair and
[18:57] constantly has kissed my feet since i've
[18:59] been here i i have something against you
[19:02] simon
[19:04] that then he turn turns to her i just i
[19:08] can just imagine seeing her standing
[19:09] there and her big pretty eyes all
[19:11] stained up and her face
[19:13] is and where she had grease and
[19:19] off of the road on her face and and she
[19:22] she thinks and and what
[19:25] have i done
[19:27] and have i done wrong
[19:31] he said it and i say unto her her sins
[19:34] which are many are all forgiven go in
[19:36] peace what was it she recognized she
[19:39] recognized her opportunities see she did
[19:41] it she did him a service the pharisees
[19:44] didn't do it she saw it and recognized
[19:46] his presence
[19:47] and what what did it do it washed what
[19:50] what it didn't release to her
[19:52] forgiveness released to her forgiveness
[19:55] of her sins what did it
[19:57] do also it also released the power of
[20:00] god to show them unbelievers that he was
[20:03] a prophet he knowed who she was it also
[20:06] released joy and power and eternal life
[20:08] it released that
[20:10] amen and and
[20:12] and see see what she did as as any
[20:16] example of
[20:18] um
[20:19] not not caring about the fears that try
[20:22] to pull you back from doing what you
[20:24] know is why she had it on her heart i've
[20:26] got to do this i've got to go and buy
[20:28] that at alabaster box and only hit his
[20:30] feet and they all
[20:32] ignored her they all all just was like
[20:36] no no that's
[20:38] what he's just uh
[20:40] we're just gonna
[20:42] um we're not going to
[20:44] greet him or anything we don't don't
[20:45] really
[20:46] care about him he is
[20:48] like it's like inviting this
[20:51] homeless guy off the street to tonight
[20:55] out front from the street with his dirty
[20:57] feet and everything why would we even
[20:59] want to deal with that and but that was
[21:01] because they didn't know who he was and
[21:04] and yet that she even though she was so
[21:06] scared and she felt it felt in her heart
[21:10] i
[21:11] i don't know
[21:12] i i um
[21:14] my flash is telling me say no don't do
[21:17] that that that's that's a prophet right
[21:19] there you don't want to touch him you
[21:20] don't want to get close to him you're
[21:22] not worthy to be in his presence even
[21:24] but but yet yet
[21:26] she felt in herself to that that i have
[21:29] to it's it's
[21:32] uh seeing his feet dirty i can't
[21:35] understand it he's he's
[21:37] more than this he he he deserves this he
[21:42] she recognized who he was
[21:44] and and when and in doing that she she
[21:47] felt she had to do in that service she
[21:49] had to to go go through that in and i
[21:52] know uh it feels sometimes that that god
[21:55] is calling you due to a certain purpose
[21:57] to each and every one of us have our own
[22:00] calling in our own specific place and
[22:03] and it takes getting out of your comfort
[22:05] zone and getting getting past that and
[22:07] saying
[22:08] i don't care what anybody else is going
[22:10] to think she knew she knew the pharisees
[22:12] they says or whoever across from jesus
[22:16] was going to judge her she knew everyone
[22:18] in the building was going to say and
[22:20] think things against her
[22:22] look at this this prostitute going up to
[22:25] this this man and washing his his feet
[22:29] with her hair look look at her
[22:32] and he should know what kind of vile
[22:35] thing this is right here
[22:39] and and all throughout the bible it
[22:40] always considers a prostitute as being
[22:42] the worst sinner in in the bible pretty
[22:44] much
[22:46] and that there she was annoying
[22:47] anointing his his feet with oil you know
[22:50] like coming out of her comfort zone
[22:52] which obviously she wasn't comfortable
[22:54] no doing that knowing
[22:56] who he he was and and i couldn't could
[22:59] imagine and just about
[23:01] anyone being that close to him and
[23:03] knowing who he was that would be nervous
[23:06] and be scared of what what he's he may
[23:09] be thinking and what what he might he
[23:11] might think of me in the end is he gonna
[23:14] accept this and and we we don't know see
[23:18] with
[23:19] with me
[23:22] i remember when i was at linton a little
[23:25] kid
[23:26] in the
[23:27] pew
[23:28] wanting to say men but i couldn't say
[23:31] amen because i was too shy
[23:33] and i remember i was like you know and
[23:35] and the first time
[23:37] raising my uh
[23:39] hand is i i here i got written down here
[23:43] i remember one of the first times
[23:44] raising my hand in church during a
[23:46] prayer and picking to make sure
[23:49] no no one was watching and and i and i
[23:51] wasn't the only one and raising my hand
[23:54] i remember just it was just like like
[23:56] that was is it was my fa what family
[23:59] sitting next to me or standing next to
[24:01] me and i would just be it just be like
[24:05] oh no oh if
[24:06] my my other family are raising their
[24:08] hand
[24:09] maybe i shouldn't it is it was just like
[24:11] that
[24:12] and
[24:14] and and uh
[24:16] and and so it would also be when the the
[24:18] first time i started saying amen i said
[24:21] it so quietly even i couldn't hear
[24:23] myself saying amen
[24:27] amen
[24:29] and and and it it just uh
[24:33] every time i mean it it's just like like
[24:35] that i remember
[24:37] um
[24:40] when when i was younger i decided that i
[24:42] was going to pray to them and dismiss my
[24:44] sunday school class for extra points
[24:48] of course i wouldn't do without getting
[24:49] any extra points but
[24:51] instead i froze
[24:53] and and uh there and in silence there
[24:56] was complete silence everything was
[24:58] quite
[25:01] and and uh
[25:03] everything was completely silent for for
[25:05] like
[25:06] three minutes or so and uh because i
[25:08] couldn't think of anything i was so
[25:10] nervous
[25:11] i was like come on you gotta say
[25:12] something
[25:15] all of a sudden my mind completely froze
[25:19] i i couldn't i couldn't get a single
[25:21] word out my my mouth
[25:24] and
[25:25] and and that now not now look at me i'm
[25:29] preaching i mean that that's proof that
[25:31] god can change someone sin
[25:34] so much
[25:35] it just takes that desire on the inside
[25:38] that you realize this is more important
[25:41] than anything and you surrender
[25:42] everything to him and realize that it
[25:44] doesn't matter what anyone thinks only
[25:47] what god thinks and that is how i've
[25:50] come this far i i don't say oh i've
[25:53] worked myself up this far i say it was
[25:56] it was not nothing but god that's helped
[25:58] me through it through this whole thing
[26:01] and
[26:02] just to even and get the strength to go
[26:04] up here and preach i mean it takes a lot
[26:08] don't don't get me wrong i still have
[26:10] fears and and nervousness but
[26:13] i i know know that oh i'm doing this for
[26:15] god because
[26:17] what he thinks is all that really
[26:19] matters
[26:21] amen
[26:22] and and
[26:25] every time i i asked them
[26:28] for them to sing this song because every
[26:29] time i hear that song with the lyrics
[26:32] that special night when i saw your
[26:34] glorious light i
[26:36] i remember that night at youth service
[26:39] here years ago
[26:41] there was a youth service in
[26:44] and it was just like every single youth
[26:46] service that i went to i was like
[26:50] there's always that pool you you you
[26:53] need to to go to that alter there's
[26:55] there's just something and it was like
[26:57] the first second youth in camp it was
[27:00] here i think he was in the pew back
[27:02] there
[27:03] when i was just
[27:04] thinking and what what was everyone
[27:07] gonna think was was i was there with my
[27:10] siblings uh annabelle and michael john
[27:12] and i was just like
[27:14] i don't know if i should do this i don't
[27:16] think
[27:17] and it was like that almost every time i
[27:19] always had that call
[27:20] something
[27:21] something in in my heart said go
[27:24] but but then i always tell my bat and
[27:26] self something always held myself back i
[27:28] believe it was satan it wasn't myself
[27:30] because because i wanted to go but but
[27:32] it was always something that said no
[27:34] what are your family going to think what
[27:35] what is what what are they going to
[27:37] think what is
[27:38] is and my brothers and sisters going to
[27:41] think what
[27:42] and then it was just in just that one
[27:45] one time
[27:46] when it was so overwhelming i said
[27:48] enough
[27:49] don't don't think and i i was just like
[27:52] hey i i i just
[27:54] let let go i just completely said i'm
[27:58] going to do this because i feel
[28:00] something on the inside that's calling
[28:01] me to that altar i felt
[28:05] felt that i i had to go and and it was
[28:08] just drawing me and it got
[28:10] so much like that and and what are they
[28:12] going to think what it what's your
[28:13] family god think you look stupid and i
[28:15] said it i'm gonna go i don't care what
[28:18] anyone else thinks
[28:21] i don't i was like don't think because i
[28:24] i seen something that said and
[28:26] if you
[28:27] whenever you there's a five-second
[28:30] rule where where you just tell yourself
[28:32] you gotta do it in five seconds you
[28:34] gotta let go of of the the thoughts that
[28:36] try to hold you back and you and when
[28:38] you know that you you got to do it you
[28:40] just
[28:41] don't think at all instead instead of
[28:44] if you're thinking loads of dots and
[28:46] everything you just say enough don't
[28:47] think and so so i walked out i walked
[28:50] down that
[28:51] and it was these pews down here i walked
[28:54] down and i got
[28:57] and and i remember i was kneeling
[29:00] i i remember it was like
[29:03] i was i was in this view like i think
[29:06] right here and and
[29:09] and i was just right here and
[29:12] and i would i was just thinking
[29:14] my siblings are right there and i was
[29:16] thinking
[29:18] just don't think it's just like
[29:19] something to control my feet and i just
[29:22] walked up like this and and then i
[29:25] remember i was like right in here and
[29:27] then i just
[29:28] it got on my knees and i raised my hands
[29:30] and then and then
[29:32] it was it was so amazing and i i was
[29:34] just praying and i was crying and crying
[29:37] out to god i didn't care what anyone
[29:39] else thinks i i'm
[29:41] i'm giving my my everything to you lord
[29:43] and i just
[29:45] and i i believe that was one the night i
[29:47] got saved and it was just like like i
[29:50] seen
[29:52] i was with my eyes shut and i've seen
[29:55] i've seen in uh
[29:57] this
[29:58] i seen a dive like in a pillar of fire
[30:01] air shaved like like a fire and it was
[30:03] just in my mind it was just
[30:06] i couldn't explain it it's just so
[30:08] amazing i could feel the presence of god
[30:10] i don't believe that that was when i got
[30:12] the baptism into the holy ghost but that
[30:14] was that was when i felt that in the
[30:16] holy ghost for the first time and it was
[30:18] the most amazing experience and i can
[30:20] always go back to that time because it
[30:22] was such a powerful night and that's
[30:24] what why i say
[30:26] when i sing that song
[30:28] on that special night when i saw your
[30:30] glorious light that was that special
[30:33] night when i saw his glorious thought it
[30:34] was it was the most amazing thing i've
[30:37] ever experienced
[30:39] from that time and then i've experienced
[30:42] similar experiences but
[30:44] but with everyone everything that almost
[30:46] the same as that like when when i got
[30:48] baptized and stuff what i
[30:50] said but it was so so amazing that
[30:53] special night and
[30:55] and when i i just let go and i didn't
[30:58] care what anybody else thinks and that
[31:00] that's how it is that that that's how
[31:02] it's got to be we always get in in a
[31:05] place where we're like looking at
[31:08] the the people next to us what are they
[31:09] going to think and they say i feel like
[31:12] dancing
[31:13] but you don't because you're like oh i'm
[31:16] going to look like an idiot here i'm
[31:18] going to look stupid and and that's and
[31:21] that's when i learned
[31:23] i i got to get out of my comfort zone
[31:25] and and i don't i don't care
[31:28] you have to get to that place where you
[31:29] don't care what anybody else thinks
[31:31] that's how it is to begin with with the
[31:33] the gospel to begin with you don't care
[31:35] what anybody else thinks yeah and and
[31:38] just like noah everyone's laughing and
[31:40] look at this city and here building an
[31:42] ark when there's never been any rain
[31:44] ever and and yet yeah and you got to be
[31:48] someone's full you're either full for
[31:50] christ or you're full for the devil and
[31:52] that that's how that's how it is and and
[31:55] you you can either go
[31:57] too far
[31:58] or you can just stay in a comfortable
[32:02] place in the church pew and just sit in
[32:04] the back and just be like this all the
[32:06] time and and never have really never
[32:09] really have
[32:10] much of an experience and just be a
[32:13] like a baptist
[32:15] oh my that that's that that's what we we
[32:19] need
[32:20] to do
[32:21] just just let go
[32:23] of these and these
[32:25] these thoughts of doubt what and and
[32:29] thinking
[32:31] what is everyone else gonna think
[32:33] i don't i don't know if i should do this
[32:37] and and we always go back to that and
[32:40] and that's what happens when
[32:42] when when you let the the devil get
[32:44] control uh oh when you you just stay
[32:47] stay and stay back and he's he's got you
[32:49] where he wants you if you if you just
[32:52] listen to every single time he tells you
[32:54] yes sit still sit still stay where you
[32:57] at don't do don't do anything
[33:00] just don't don't move
[33:03] so something that doesn't move at all is
[33:05] dead
[33:07] [Music]
[33:09] just like brother branham said with
[33:10] emotion something that is emotionless is
[33:13] dead
[33:15] and and so that that's how it is also
[33:17] with moving making
[33:19] a move
[33:21] for god instead of just sitting still or
[33:24] just
[33:25] sitting back and never really doing
[33:27] anything and never really
[33:30] seeking god that's why i said sometimes
[33:32] it takes the hard times to get you to
[33:35] the place where where you need to be to
[33:38] aid and and that's kind of how it is
[33:41] with trials and things if god let us all
[33:44] have a really comfortable life
[33:46] then we probably would still be out in
[33:48] the world a lot most of us or and and
[33:51] that's how how it is we have to go
[33:52] through
[33:54] troubles and trials and things other and
[33:56] or otherwise we won't appreciate the
[33:59] good
[34:00] and that is also why their sickness and
[34:02] everything else because
[34:04] as you can't enjoy being well without
[34:07] there being sickness
[34:10] and and uh you can't enjoy the sunshine
[34:13] as much without there being rainy days
[34:17] amen
[34:21] and and that's and i i've
[34:24] when i understood that that
[34:26] when we get we get sick sometimes and we
[34:28] get back
[34:30] things happen
[34:33] so and and that's the thing if if
[34:35] everything was always good we would
[34:37] always
[34:38] we we would
[34:39] never be content
[34:41] we would never be content because
[34:44] as you get into a place where you want
[34:46] more and more and more and then and then
[34:48] it's just always good good times and you
[34:50] just like you you begin to get lazy and
[34:53] that's how always how it is in in every
[34:55] generation and everything if
[34:58] if things go good all the time then
[35:00] people start getting lazy
[35:08] i also heard this quote i i kind of put
[35:10] these to the side because i wasn't sure
[35:11] if i was going to say them
[35:13] i heard this quote while back
[35:16] lazy people do a little work and think
[35:18] they should be winning but winners work
[35:20] as hard as possible and still worry if
[35:23] they're being lazy
[35:24] and
[35:25] i mean that that really has a lot
[35:28] to do with um
[35:31] that that is how it is really because
[35:33] um
[35:35] i mean uh if you
[35:36] really
[35:38] going after something you're not just
[35:40] going to sit back and relax and say i'll
[35:42] be
[35:45] when you really desire something when
[35:47] you really want something you work hard
[35:50] for you're not you're not like like what
[35:52] just sit back and relax and not do
[35:54] anything about it and then that's why it
[35:56] takes it takes for us to make a move in
[35:59] order to make god
[36:01] and in order for god to move
[36:03] for us
[36:04] like and every
[36:06] um
[36:07] all throughout the bible it always shows
[36:09] a time where
[36:10] um uh god will bring prophets and stuff
[36:14] and tell the the nations repent and
[36:17] repent or perish basically and and and
[36:21] if they ain't they decided to just sit
[36:24] still and not do anything then
[36:27] that then
[36:28] they'll they'll receive the wrath of god
[36:30] otherwise
[36:31] is
[36:33] they have to make that move
[36:35] for god in order for god to to move for
[36:39] them then that is why if if anyone is
[36:42] sick or an error in need of something if
[36:46] you
[36:47] don't if you just um stay still and not
[36:50] even and see god
[36:52] that then god's not going to move for
[36:53] you either
[36:56] amen
[37:01] and and that's why
[37:02] god demands us to reach out in faith
[37:05] reach out
[37:07] to god in faith if you're seeking for
[37:09] something
[37:11] and and when god asks you to do
[37:13] something
[37:14] to do it and and to do it with
[37:17] thanksgiving and do it with diligence in
[37:20] and with your whole heart i've seen a
[37:22] sign on the way here
[37:24] that that set says
[37:26] his work work
[37:28] er eric hard with with
[37:31] your hands and your heart
[37:33] so so
[37:34] we're not to just work hard work with
[37:37] our hands and
[37:38] say oh i'm i'm doing all this work all
[37:40] these good things but if your heart's
[37:42] not in it then what really work are you
[37:43] doing you're just doing it for yourself
[37:46] if if you're not doing with all your
[37:47] heart and your ear
[37:49] you say lord god i'm doing this for you
[37:51] this is what you have called me to do
[37:54] and and you give it everything that you
[37:56] have and then and then that's
[37:59] that's the kind of work that god
[38:01] wants us to do a kind of work that we're
[38:05] doing it for him and not for ourselves
[38:09] and and we're giving in our whole heart
[38:11] not not just doing it because we have to
[38:14] but we're doing it because we want to
[38:17] and that's how it always should be in
[38:19] everything in youtube and it says in the
[38:22] bible in in everything you do do it for
[38:24] the glory of god
[38:26] amen
[38:29] and um
[38:31] i also got a few other
[38:33] places in the bible
[38:36] uh let's see
[38:45] but be doers of the word and not hears
[38:48] only deceiving in your own selves this
[38:50] is james 1 and verse 22
[38:53] for for if
[38:55] any be a hearer of the word not a doer
[38:58] he is like unto a man beholding his
[39:00] natural face in a glass for he beholdeth
[39:03] himself and go with his wings straight
[39:05] away forget it what manner of man he was
[39:09] but whoso
[39:10] looketh into the
[39:11] perfect law of liberty and continue it
[39:13] there he being not a
[39:16] forgetful here but a doer of the work
[39:20] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[39:23] see there's so many people in this world
[39:26] that are hearers of the word but not
[39:28] doers then they say oh i'm i've actually
[39:32] met people that say i i follow the bible
[39:34] i've i um
[39:37] well i i read the entire bible i
[39:40] actually talked to someone like that but
[39:42] yet they're living out in the world and
[39:43] doing whatever they want and not doers
[39:46] otherwise they're hearers but not doers
[39:48] of the word and and you say oh amen to
[39:51] thy amen to that but but if you never
[39:53] actually follow it
[39:55] then then what are you doing
[39:58] see
[39:58] god calls us to be doers of his word and
[40:01] not only hearers
[40:05] and and so
[40:07] that's and that's how it is and if in
[40:09] order to get god to move on the scene in
[40:12] it it takes
[40:14] two people in the in the it takes two
[40:17] for a relationship to come to to be so
[40:20] it takes two for for god to make a move
[40:24] in your life it takes two takes you
[40:28] um presenting yourself in the right way
[40:30] and seeking after god uh for god to come
[40:33] on the scene and move in your life you
[40:36] have to move for him to say god god come
[40:39] and help me in
[40:40] and and you follow his word exactly like
[40:43] that
[40:44] then he'll come and and and help you and
[40:47] what whatever you need and he'll be
[40:49] there
[40:51] amen
[41:08] all right i got another place here in
[41:11] uh
[41:12] matthew 20
[41:14] uh verse 30 to 34. and behold two blind
[41:18] men sitting by the wayside when they
[41:20] heard that jesus passed by cried out
[41:22] saying have mercy on us o lord thou son
[41:24] of david and the multitude rebuked them
[41:27] because they they should not hold their
[41:30] peace
[41:31] see that the multitude said and you you
[41:34] you guys are being saying stupid what
[41:36] are you doing he he's and he's got work
[41:39] to do you're you're you're not worth him
[41:42] stopping you're look at him he he's he's
[41:45] the
[41:46] prophet or he said the different ones
[41:48] saying different things he's the prophet
[41:50] he's he's he's so busy he don't got time
[41:53] for you
[41:54] he doesn't care about a sinner like you
[41:56] stay still
[41:58] but they cried the more saying have
[41:59] mercy on us oh
[42:01] son of david
[42:03] and jesus stood still and called them
[42:05] and said what will ye they that i shall
[42:08] do unto you
[42:10] and they said unto him lord that our
[42:12] eyes may be open so jesus had compassion
[42:15] on them and touched their eyes
[42:17] immediately their eyes received sight
[42:18] and they followed him see see they
[42:21] didn't care what anybody else else was
[42:23] saying around them they're probably
[42:24] telling them all kinds of stuff if y'all
[42:27] ain't worthy yeah
[42:29] you don't know
[42:30] i don't even know this guy why and why
[42:33] why cr are you crying for it then shut
[42:37] up but
[42:38] but yet something on the inside told
[42:39] them they they can receive their healing
[42:42] they can become
[42:43] they can see if if they
[42:45] he just has to say the word
[42:48] you know their received their sight and
[42:51] they had faith and they pushed and they
[42:53] said i don't care what these other
[42:55] people are saying i don't care what
[42:57] anybody else says i'm i i'm not going to
[43:01] to let these voices stop me from doing
[43:06] it
[43:07] from getting my healing i'm not going to
[43:08] let anything stop me because i know this
[43:11] could be my only chance to to receive my
[43:14] sight and so so they and that's what
[43:16] they did they and they cried out
[43:19] have mercy on us oh lord and they they
[43:22] didn't stay still and they didn't stand
[43:24] sit back and watch or
[43:28] well they couldn't have watched them
[43:30] anyway but
[43:32] it hurt and walked by
[43:35] but but that's how it was they
[43:39] they they couldn't just let him pass
[43:41] them by they had to to receive their
[43:43] healing they had to get
[43:45] that that healing
[43:47] and and they knew that they could
[43:48] receive it
[43:50] amen and that that's how how i know i've
[43:54] i felt a lot and that the feeling of
[43:58] um pressure they didn't get given to to
[44:01] peer pressure or or anything that that
[44:05] around them that would try to hinder
[44:07] them
[44:08] from receiving that that healing they
[44:10] wasn't listening to any
[44:13] voice that told them and not to go
[44:17] and i better hurry here we know
[44:19] much time anyways
[44:21] um
[44:23] here in luke 14 16-33 it says
[44:27] that and then
[44:28] then
[44:29] said he unto a certain man
[44:31] made a great supper and paid money and
[44:33] sent his servants at supper time and say
[44:37] to them that were bitten come for all
[44:39] things are not ready and they all with
[44:41] one consent began to make excuse first
[44:44] one said unto him i have bought a piece
[44:45] of ground and i
[44:47] don't see it i pray thee have an excuse
[44:51] another said i've bought
[44:53] five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them
[44:56] i pray that you haven't excused another
[44:58] said i have married a wife and therefore
[45:00] i cannot come so that servant came and
[45:03] showed his lord these things
[45:05] and
[45:06] then the master of the house being angry
[45:08] said to his servant go out quickly into
[45:10] the streets and lanes of the city and
[45:12] bring in heather the poor and the maimed
[45:14] in the hall and the blind and the
[45:15] servant said lord islam is a commanded
[45:18] and yet there is room
[45:20] and the lord said unto the servant go
[45:22] into highways and hedges and compel them
[45:24] and to come in that my house may be
[45:27] filled
[45:29] and and um
[45:30] that then i'm not going for i'm probably
[45:33] not going to read this whole thing but
[45:35] but that's the the thing we we always
[45:37] it's either
[45:38] um we we think to ourselves
[45:42] i don't i'm not sure if i should do this
[45:44] and and stuff and things trying to hold
[45:46] you back and then you begin to make
[45:48] excuses and excuse time and time and
[45:51] again in in in the bible this is quite a
[45:54] few people i think
[45:55] that have made excuses like like moses i
[45:58] cannot speak um very clearly
[46:02] and and i don't i don't know if i am
[46:04] able to do this and and will they
[46:06] actually hear me and whatever and and
[46:09] beginning making excuses that that's how
[46:12] it is sometimes excuses after excuses
[46:15] making excuses and and
[46:17] and if we keep making excuses time and
[46:19] time again eventually
[46:22] time is going to run out and we can we
[46:24] can't keep making excuses and this many
[46:28] people today make excuses i have my job
[46:31] i have
[46:32] i can't make it on wednesday because of
[46:34] my job i made that excuse one time
[46:37] but but then i i started realizing wait
[46:42] now it's either i'm just making an
[46:44] excuse
[46:46] or i'm i'm
[46:48] simply
[46:49] uh
[46:50] i simply can't or i'm making excuse and
[46:52] then i realize
[46:54] well
[46:55] maybe i can try to figure this out and
[46:57] and then and then i actually started
[46:59] going on wednesday nights even with my
[47:01] full-time job i had
[47:03] and
[47:04] and and yet and then and then that's
[47:06] where i realized
[47:08] that i was actually just making an
[47:10] excuse
[47:11] and even though though it was late and i
[47:14] got off work late a lot of times i was
[47:17] still simply
[47:18] making an excuse when i
[47:21] when i could actually make it to church
[47:23] and and
[47:24] and that's what we we do a lot of times
[47:26] we make make excuses and when uh
[47:30] something may be going on but
[47:32] and you say i don't got the time i don't
[47:34] got at the
[47:36] time i got this job and everything and
[47:38] i've made those excuses many times i
[47:40] know by experience
[47:42] that that it's actually just an excuse
[47:46] that you're not making the time to do
[47:48] instead you're just saying you've got
[47:49] busy schedule and everything that blah
[47:51] blah blah and then and then you go in
[47:54] and and
[47:55] you need we need to go and look at our
[47:57] schedule and get done a pen
[48:00] all right time to make time with god
[48:02] make time with god
[48:03] read the bible start writing down in our
[48:05] schedule let me let me make time for god
[48:09] and stop making excuses and stop saying
[48:11] i can't do this i can't stand uh i can't
[48:15] seek him i can't i don't have time to
[48:18] pray for an hour in the closet i don't
[48:20] got time to do this
[48:22] well no
[48:24] for for me it was simply i i don't got
[48:27] time in it and then i realized well
[48:30] and then then oh yeah okay you're
[48:33] spending how much time on your phone
[48:34] four hours a day okay
[48:38] and and then you cut down on the time
[48:40] that you spend on things that are
[48:42] trivial and that don't matter and spend
[48:44] that time for god and
[48:46] and now my uh time on my phone i think
[48:50] his has either has been like cut in half
[48:52] for like at one hour or something and
[48:55] and and really that that's that's the
[48:58] thing we need to stop making excuses see
[49:01] see god and i i felt it when
[49:04] when
[49:05] god brought me to this place where i'm
[49:07] at such a low
[49:08] to i to where i actually start seeking
[49:11] god and i actually start
[49:13] really getting on my knees and praying
[49:15] for for
[49:16] like two hours it was in the closet and
[49:19] and how did i have that time to do it
[49:22] uh
[49:23] well i quit my job
[49:26] well i had that time because i made that
[49:28] time and i didn't miss
[49:34] well that that didn't help at all that
[49:36] job did
[49:39] but it's it's always that we we make
[49:41] excuses and say we ain't got time and
[49:44] because of this or because of that but
[49:46] we need to get a pen and write in our
[49:48] schedule that's that's what we need to
[49:49] do
[49:51] amen
[49:56] i know i know i i need to do that more
[49:59] than that
[50:00] but write him down in your schedule a
[50:02] little more
[50:03] a little more
[50:06] a little less time with this and a
[50:07] little more time with him
[50:10] reading in the bible and stuff
[50:18] [Applause]
[50:26] amen um let's see here
[50:45] like like um
[50:48] like like daniel and and like
[50:50] um
[50:53] uh the uh
[50:54] shatter act me shack and abednego but
[50:57] when when a time really came down to it
[51:00] they they didn't and just
[51:03] um
[51:04] give in to peer pressure like everybody
[51:06] else everybody else bowen what is
[51:07] everybody gonna think if we just stand
[51:10] here
[51:11] and and but they stood there anyway
[51:13] because they knew
[51:15] what they were standing for and and they
[51:17] knew even if they would get burnt up
[51:19] even if they would get burned burnt up
[51:22] to a crisp and and they would die
[51:25] they're still going to stand for for god
[51:27] and and really
[51:29] a
[51:30] they'd just
[51:34] not give in to anything that they try to
[51:36] and try to
[51:38] to um tell him and well why aren't you
[51:41] bowing and
[51:42] we're not careful to to tell this to you
[51:45] but we won't serve your god we won't bow
[51:48] to him
[51:51] and and that they made that that stand
[51:53] for god they made they even when the
[51:56] pressure was as at the uh
[51:59] to the place where they would die if
[52:01] they didn't stand
[52:03] they still
[52:06] stood for him and they still
[52:24] watch
[52:25] and this is a um
[52:28] quotes by brother brandon watch
[52:30] here comes the the word the preacher
[52:32] faith cometh by hearing hearing the word
[52:36] listen to elijah go seek god first bake

[52:51] pronounce that but
[52:53] run dry until the the day that god sends
[52:56] rain on the earth amen you

[53:19] dipped out a big hole cake out of the
[53:22] barrel enough to make one for her son
[53:25] and eat until the rain come why
[53:27] god sent his preacher faith cometh by
[53:30] hearing hearing of the word the
[53:32] invitations give out
[53:35] now as soon as invitation was given out
[53:39] then the excuses was made oh yes what
[53:42] one married a wife and the other one
[53:45] brought some oxen you know the story
[53:47] that that's the way it is today god made
[53:50] the supper and ready sent the preacher
[53:53] to preach the faith what happened oh i
[53:56] can't go
[53:57] because i'm a deacon in another church i
[53:59] just couldn't do that well i couldn't go
[54:02] because it was it would lower my
[54:04] prestige
[54:05] your prestige then then oh
[54:08] i couldn't
[54:09] because i didn't don't believe them old
[54:13] holy rollers that's acting like that
[54:15] i'll just i'm going to live my life the
[54:19] excuses
[54:20] was made
[54:21] oh it's too straight i wouldn't want to
[54:24] do that excuse and and say well i'm so
[54:27] tired when i i come in at night i can't
[54:30] go to church that's excuses today oh i'm
[54:34] afraid that
[54:35] and husband wouldn't like it
[54:39] and i'm afraid my wife would kick me out
[54:41] of the house she ought not to that
[54:43] that's the kind of men you are that's
[54:45] right button but there you are excuses
[54:47] made many of them
[54:50] we could name excuses
[54:53] amen
[54:54] we we all make excuses sometimes
[54:57] why we can't do this or that for god and
[54:59] say oh i'm not good enough and and me
[55:02] maybe
[55:03] i'm i'm still questioning whether god
[55:05] actually wants me to do that or not
[55:08] when it's in his word and for us to do
[55:10] those things and and different things
[55:12] like that we we have a tendency to make
[55:15] excuses on just about everything and and
[55:18] we say well i can't can't go to altar
[55:21] to be prayed for because i'm too scared
[55:26] that's why it takes and accept that pull
[55:29] that that desire that and you just say
[55:32] enough and you go forward anyhow even in
[55:36] with all the fear i was so scared this
[55:39] is the first time of me walking out in
[55:41] faith and saying i'm gonna go to the
[55:43] altar because i feel that call in my
[55:45] heart that i
[55:46] got to and and i i felt that i had to
[55:50] and and that's how how it is is despite
[55:53] the fear despite the thoughts that that
[55:56] come in my head the things that satan
[55:58] tries to tell me to not he was trying
[56:00] with everything he could it was like it
[56:02] always felt like chains were trying to
[56:05] hold me back
[56:06] from going to the altar
[56:10] and i was
[56:13] the alter oh my and i had that
[56:16] experience and and that experience came
[56:20] from
[56:22] from i'm just
[56:24] just
[56:25] giving into what what god wants me to do
[56:27] knowing this is what what god wants me
[56:30] to do and you put that at the
[56:32] foot in front of you
[56:35] and you just do it don't think about the
[56:37] things that that satan tries to put in
[56:40] your mind you gotta take that step if i
[56:42] would have just stood still if i would
[56:44] have just
[56:46] stood there and in and resisted every
[56:49] single time i would be resisting the
[56:51] holy ghost and that that's how it is
[56:53] sometimes we resist the holy ghost by
[56:55] making excuses after excuses and sick
[56:58] and put in these lights and here and you
[57:00] listen to me yeah i guess i'm too scared
[57:02] yeah i guess
[57:04] i have all this fear and anxiety of me
[57:07] doing that i i'm so so nervous as
[57:10] to do that i'm so nervous to start
[57:12] saying amen in church i'm too nervous to
[57:14] raise my hand i'm too nervous to do this
[57:18] excuse after excuse after excuse i can't
[57:20] do it i can't do it i can't do it but
[57:23] jesus christ says you can
[57:25] and and he has given you the power to do
[57:27] it he has given you you the power you
[57:30] just have to reach out in faith and say
[57:32] god i surrender myself to you god i i
[57:36] know i'm scared i know i have this fear
[57:38] i know i have this anxiety
[57:40] but yeah i'm going to do it anyway
[57:41] because it's what you want me to do
[57:44] and and you reach out in faith and you
[57:47] say
[57:47] god you can't take control and and
[57:51] oh my and i took my feet forward and i
[57:54] just said
[57:55] i got
[57:56] to do this i got to do this no turning
[57:59] back no turning back i'm i have to this
[58:03] is my calling
[58:05] god is calling me to the altar and
[58:08] and not give in to the excuses don't
[58:11] just stop making excuses it's not too
[58:14] late for
[58:16] where
[58:18] the time time is running out when when
[58:20] those and people that make those excuses
[58:23] and excuses and excuses will one day say
[58:26] i wish i didn't give in
[58:28] i wish i wish i didn't give in to those
[58:30] excuses the lies that satan said i wish
[58:32] i didn't
[58:34] and it's just be i wish i didn't i wish
[58:36] i did this i wish i went forward i wish
[58:38] but i was too scared
[58:42] and that that
[58:43] time comes and you're just like
[58:47] i could imagine if i didn't walk forward
[58:50] if i
[58:51] if i didn't and go forward if i didn't
[58:54] surrender myself to god if i didn't want
[58:56] to take those first steps out of my
[58:59] comfort zone out of that fear that
[59:02] that fear that was trying to hold me
[59:04] back
[59:05] i could imagine on the day and day of
[59:06] judgment
[59:08] i put it in your heart to do that i put
[59:09] it in your heart to go forward
[59:12] i called you
[59:13] but you didn't hear it
[59:15] uh and i was too scared god i was i had
[59:18] too much fear i i it held me back
[59:22] i was too scared to get out of my
[59:23] comfort zone to raise my hand for you
[59:26] but during the prayer thing i was i was
[59:28] too scared to get on my knees to pray i
[59:31] was
[59:33] excuses after excuses god doesn't demand
[59:36] us and give excuses
[59:39] and and when that time comes i don't
[59:41] want that guilt and and feeling uh i
[59:44] could have done better i could have done
[59:46] this better but i was too scared and i i
[59:49] i was scared of what other people would
[59:51] think
[59:52] it doesn't matter what anybody else
[59:54] thinks the only
[59:55] thought that counts is god's thoughts
[59:59] and and when we let go
[1:00:01] of the the fear and the anxiety and the
[1:00:04] things that hold us back and and sure
[1:00:07] some of us have it worse than others so
[1:00:09] bad i imagine i was just i'm so scared
[1:00:13] and like i said i couldn't even
[1:00:15] speak when it came to to praying in in
[1:00:18] sunday school and there's
[1:00:20] the fear and the anxiety and the the
[1:00:23] feeling i don't think i could do this
[1:00:25] how am i i remember thinking
[1:00:28] why would god choose me to be a preacher
[1:00:30] i didn't and in fact i wasn't even sure
[1:00:32] if my mom was right about that calling
[1:00:34] that's why god had to reveal to me
[1:00:36] himself
[1:00:37] that that this is my calling and god had
[1:00:40] to reveal it specifically to me because
[1:00:42] i didn't really believe wave necessarily
[1:00:44] what mom said oh i'm gonna be a preacher
[1:00:46] well
[1:00:47] i'm too scared how am i i'm have stage
[1:00:50] fright i had so bad stage fight
[1:00:53] and and people say well you have to go
[1:00:56] sing well that was me going out of my
[1:00:58] comfort zone to do that and i went up
[1:01:00] there my knees shaking like this and
[1:01:03] you couldn't see on the film i was just
[1:01:05] shaking so bad when i first went there
[1:01:07] to sing it i was like
[1:01:10] and here i am still still
[1:01:13] being
[1:01:14] i still have
[1:01:15] such an um i still have nervousness when
[1:01:18] i first get up here because it's going
[1:01:20] out of my comfort zone but i know it is
[1:01:22] what god called me to do and i know
[1:01:25] know that this is
[1:01:26] is the place i'm supposed to be and so i
[1:01:29] don't care what anybody else thinks i'm
[1:01:32] i get here and i get scared what is
[1:01:34] other people kind of thinking and what's
[1:01:35] that good sermon and i'm always like if
[1:01:37] i play my papers and
[1:01:39] try trying to have fun
[1:01:41] and try to not have it too much of a
[1:01:43] silence um
[1:01:45] time try to find something and then and
[1:01:48] mumble over myself and my words and
[1:01:51] but i'm i'm still here and i'm i'm doing
[1:01:54] what god called me to do and getting out
[1:01:56] of my comfort zone and uh and sometimes
[1:01:58] i need to remember
[1:02:00] that
[1:02:00] this is what god wants me to do it
[1:02:03] doesn't matter what anybody else thinks
[1:02:06] if god called me to do this
[1:02:09] it's okay
[1:02:11] to to be scared or just keep going just
[1:02:15] you'll be scared just do it scared
[1:02:17] just do it with all that fear
[1:02:19] nervousness just do it get out of your
[1:02:21] comfort zone and it'll get less and less
[1:02:23] and and the fear and anxiety will start
[1:02:26] to leave and and you'll get mad more and
[1:02:28] more er
[1:02:30] in
[1:02:31] and you'll get less
[1:02:33] and less scared and fearful and nervous
[1:02:36] and and that's how it is it's always a
[1:02:38] slow journey and getting used to things
[1:02:41] getting
[1:02:42] but
[1:02:42] start that that's that was my point and
[1:02:46] start start getting out your comfort
[1:02:48] zone start whispering amen underneath
[1:02:51] your breath start right um
[1:02:54] raising your hands so no one can see it
[1:02:57] but but still raising your hand but just
[1:02:59] start that's
[1:03:01] how it is i i started and i i because i
[1:03:04] had that desire in my heart i wanted to
[1:03:06] i wanted to do this i i wanted to to
[1:03:10] see god i wanted to grow closer to god i
[1:03:13] wanted to get out of my comfort zone
[1:03:16] and then as the musicians come
[1:03:19] and
[1:03:20] uh
[1:03:21] even my
[1:03:22] uh sister
[1:03:25] she said my sister i seen such a change
[1:03:27] in her
[1:03:28] because she she said she listened to a
[1:03:31] sermon at the church camp
[1:03:33] and
[1:03:34] about
[1:03:35] getting out of the comfort zone your
[1:03:37] comfort zone
[1:03:39] and and and i was amazed by it and bill
[1:03:42] actually
[1:03:43] even even would dance for the lord and
[1:03:46] it's it's it was such a change that i've
[1:03:48] seen in her okay because all because she
[1:03:51] she knew
[1:03:53] that she had to start getting out of
[1:03:54] that comfort zone and start pursuing in
[1:03:58] god and start and forgetting what
[1:04:00] anybody else thinks just do what god
[1:04:03] wants you to do he
[1:04:05] his thoughts is the only thing that
[1:04:07] really counts
[1:04:09] in
[1:04:11] and
[1:04:12] and i've seen it well i didn't see her
[1:04:14] but but she told me she went and went to
[1:04:16] the
[1:04:17] uh
[1:04:18] there's a prayer line and she went in
[1:04:20] that prayer line to get prayed for and
[1:04:22] and and if she wouldn't have got i knew
[1:04:26] annabelle
[1:04:27] um
[1:04:28] i've never seen anybody go to to alter
[1:04:30] anything before so i knew
[1:04:32] i knew what it was like that first time
[1:04:34] going to all altars or or getting in the
[1:04:36] prairie line is so it's so
[1:04:40] like you're going to the altar and
[1:04:42] everybody's looking at you wonder what
[1:04:43] he's done wonder what she's done to
[1:04:46] don't think that
[1:04:48] it's not it's never a thing of
[1:04:51] what have they done look at
[1:04:54] that that's
[1:04:56] how we we can't ever get as a church we
[1:04:59] can't ever look down on the people that
[1:05:01] go go to the altar whatever it might be
[1:05:04] and
[1:05:05] and
[1:05:06] and so she went in the prayer line to go
[1:05:08] and get
[1:05:09] and prayed for and
[1:05:11] and that was that night she received the
[1:05:13] gift of holy ghost and she told me how
[1:05:16] amazing it was and
[1:05:18] and i remember
[1:05:20] us
[1:05:20] in the car and stuff on the way back and
[1:05:22] and she was
[1:05:24] shouting thank you jesus thank you jesus
[1:05:27] the the
[1:05:28] top of her lungs at one time and she
[1:05:30] said that was the same feeling she got
[1:05:32] when she got the baptism in the holy
[1:05:34] ghost again i was like oh my thank you
[1:05:38] god
[1:05:39] i was like wow this is this is amazing
[1:05:42] that she had that experience it's so
[1:05:44] amazing that how good god and god is to
[1:05:47] us
[1:05:48] amen and and i i just
[1:05:51] urge you if if there's something
[1:05:54] that
[1:05:55] if there is something that that is on
[1:05:58] your heart to do but that fear is
