[47:40] week this week so far. Amen. And I was
[47:43] studying this afternoon praying. I said,
[47:46] 'Lord, I can't do this. I have no idea.
[47:48] I can't come up with a message. You're
[47:50] going to have to do this. So, we got to
[47:52] pray. And he laid something on my heart.
[47:54] So, amen. We'll see what the Lord will
[47:56] have in store for us. Amen. For this
[47:59] evening. Amen. Um, do remember, Amen.
[48:03] Sister Betty and them. Amen. And I know

[48:10] know if she goes, she'll be in a much
[48:12] better place. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[48:15] Let's bow our heads.
[48:17] Precious, kind heavenly father, as we
[48:19] come before you, Lord, once again, Lord,
[48:21] so grateful, Lord, to feel the warmth of
[48:23] your spirit in our hearts, Lord Jesus,
[48:26] knowing, Father, that you've are keeping
[48:28] your promise, that you said you'd never
[48:31] leave us nor forsake us, even to the end
[48:33] of the world, Lord. And Father, here we
[48:35] are at the end of the world, Lord. But
[48:36] you're still with to your people,
[48:38] Father. Lord, one of these days that he
[48:40] who letth will let until he be taken out
[48:43] of the way, Lord. And we know we've been
[48:44] taught that one day God will lift his
[48:47] spirit from the Gentiles, go back to the
[48:49] Jews, Lord. And we want don't want to be
[48:51] left here, Father, when that time comes.
[48:53] But we, Lord, we want to come up to
[48:55] glory to meet you in the air, Father.
[48:57] And we want to be ready, Lord, for that
[48:58] time. And that's what we come for, Lord
[49:01] Jesus. out of the depth of our heart, we
[49:02] want to thank you, Lord, for doing a
[49:04] work in our lives, Lord Jesus, and for
[49:06] being with us and for comforting us and
[49:08] and giving us light in this darkness,
[49:11] Lord Jesus. Giving us joy in the sorrow.
[49:14] Amen. And [snorts] give us understanding
[49:16] in all of the misunderstanding that's
[49:18] out there, Lord. Father, we could just
[49:20] go on and thank you, Father, for all
[49:22] that you do for us. We ask God that
[49:24] you'd help me get out of the way now
[49:26] Lord for your prophet taught that the
[49:28] real gift is to be able to get out of
[49:30] the way. So Lord help me to get out of
[49:32] your way Lord so that you can do what
[49:35] you do Father and that's to speak to
[49:37] your people. That's to minister to your
[49:38] people. That's to speak to hearts.
[49:40] That's to change lives Lord. And just
[49:43] Father we ask God that you just come now
[49:46] in a special way in Jesus name. And
[49:48] everybody said
[49:50] &gt;&gt; amen. Praise the Lord. Turn your Bibles
[49:52] if you will. We'll go to the book of
[49:53] Isaiah. Amen. And so this is kind of a
[49:57] new message, I guess, for me. Amen. And
[50:08] Amen. In my mind, we're going to get out
[50:11] of here about a quarter after 8.
[50:14] Amen. That's in my mind.
[50:18] I got it pre-planned. So, Amen. And
[50:21] remember that's me. So we'll just let
[50:24] the God have his way. Ain't that right?
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's hope it's not quarter after
[50:29] 9. Amen.
[50:32] Well, I maybe I shouldn't say that.
[50:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, some might
[50:36] wish or some might hope that it's not.
[50:39] Amen. But anyway, Isaiah 35. Isaiah 35.
[50:52] and verse eight
[50:54] and an highway
[50:58] shall be there. Amen. And there many
[51:00] songs have actually been right. I'm on
[51:02] highway to heaven.
[51:08] You realize that's actually not correct.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; It's actually incorrect
[51:14] according to the prophet. Amen. because
[51:17] he said and a way. Brother Ram clearly
[51:20] says that's a conjunction and all right
[51:24] there's a highway and then there's a
[51:27] way. Amen. And it shall be called the
[51:31] way of holiness. Amen. Amen. So the way
[51:36] is what we want. Amen. The unclean shall
[51:40] not pass over it, but it shall be for
[51:41] those the wayfaring men, though fools
[51:44] should not heir therein. Let's go to
[51:47] Matthew. Let's go to the book of Matthew
[51:55] chapter 7
[51:58] and verse 13.
[52:02] Enter ye in at the straight gate, for
[52:05] wide is the gate, and broad is the way
[52:08] that leadth to destruction, and many
[52:10] there be that go there in that that go
[52:13] which go in thereat.
[52:16] Because straight is the gate, and narrow
[52:19] is the way, which leadth unto life, and
[52:23] few there be that find it. Amen.
[52:28] Amen. John 14
[52:31] In John 14 and with verse read verse
[52:34] six,
[52:36] Jesus saith unto him, I am the way,
[52:41] the truth, and the life. No man cometh
[52:44] unto the father but by me. Amen.
[52:49] Amen. Today I felt like I had a little
[52:51] revelation and y'all just bear with me.
[52:54] Y'all be the judge of whether it's
[52:55] whether it's correct or not. But heaven
[52:57] has an address.
[52:59] Heaven has an address.
[53:02] Amen.
[53:04] 01
[53:06] Jesus.
[53:08] Amen.
[53:10] 01 Jesus. How many knows that I was
[53:15] going to say 2000 2000 the Lord Jesus
[53:18] Christ.
[53:20] But
[53:22] 2,000 years ago is where it happened.
[53:25] Ain't that right? Calvary. And since the
[53:28] time of Christ, they begin given time
[53:30] again. Ain't that right? Amen. When you
[53:32] everything points back to the time of
[53:34] when Christ was uh died, right? So
[53:37] that's why I say 01. It might be 00. I
[53:40] could be wrong, but it's right there at
[53:43] Calvary when God came down and he
[53:46] bridged the way for us back to God.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many know? And he is the way.
[53:52] He said the way you know and he said uh
[53:59] he said u I go to prepare a place for
[54:02] you and I will come again and receive
[54:05] you unto myself that where I am there ye
[54:08] may be also and whether I go ye know and
[54:12] the way you know. How many glad that God
[54:14] made a way?
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The way to where? Heaven. How many
[54:18] knows Jesus is the way to heaven? Amen.
[54:21] He is heaven itself. He is heaven.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; You can't get to the father but by him.
[54:27] So let's put our compass and I put our
[54:29] GPS so to speak. Amen. On Jesus Christ.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; There's many, many ways, many, many
[54:36] roads. And I believe even the pope said
[54:38] not so long ago, you know, we all serve
[54:40] to God and there's many ways that we get
[54:42] to him. How many knows that's a lie?
[54:48] Yeah. because he wants everybody come
[54:49] home to papa, you know, come home to
[54:51] papa, you know, and you go your way, you
[54:53] go to heaven, get to heaven your way,
[54:55] and this one gets to heaven that way.
[54:57] That's not what Jesus taught.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus thought there's one way. There's
[55:02] one Lord, one faith, one baptism. I am
[55:04] the way. You come this way or you don't
[55:07] come.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; How many believe Jesus is the way? Now,
[55:09] our title. Have you got our title up
[55:12] there? I hope I spelled that right. I
[55:15] think y'all respelled that for me. I had
[55:17] probably had and I had navigator. The
[55:20] navigator. Amen. Amen. I had n a v a g-
[55:24] a t r something like that. But amen. So
[55:26] I'm glad you corrected my really good
[55:28] English. The navigator. We want to talk
[55:30] about the navigator for a while tonight.
[55:32] Amen. God bless you. You can be seated.
[55:35] Amen. Hope you had a stretched your legs
[55:39] really good and ready. That comfortable
[55:42] seat feels real good now, don't it?
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you richly tonight. We
[55:48] want to speak on the navigator. Amen. As
[55:51] we begin to think about this and we're
[55:53] going to basically we want to try to
[55:55] stay on the earth so to speak tonight
[55:58] because there's many times that I've
[56:00] preached. Amen. uh to where that the
[56:04] progress
[56:05] uh of mankind such as the airplane, such
[56:09] as the jets, such as uh the uh space
[56:12] shuttle and outer space travel. Brother
[56:15] Brandham said all of those natural
[56:18] achievements are a type of the spiritual
[56:21] achievements. Ain't that right? How that
[56:23] we've progressed and so forth. Amen. And
[56:25] how you know that we're you know
[56:28] spiritually speaking. Amen. We're up
[56:30] there in the astronaut age. Ain't that
[56:33] right? The age of the astronaut. Amen.
[56:37] And and we are we've got unlimited
[56:40] speed. Isn't that right? Out there. I
[56:42] guess you have unlimited speed. You can
[56:43] go really really fast out there. I don't
[56:46] know if you'd know it or not, but I
[56:48] don't know what you're going to pass to
[56:49] really tell you you're going fast. But
[56:52] anyway, but I don't want to go so much
[56:54] in that realm as I want to go just in
[56:56] talking about roads. Amen. roads. Amen.
[57:01] Traveling the roads and and and being
[57:04] navigated. I don't know. Like I said,
[57:07] the Lord just kind of give me that
[57:09] thought of the navigator. And so I said,
[57:12] "Well, you Lord, if you'll just bless
[57:14] it, then we'll go go from there." And I
[57:16] he really begin to pour it out to me.
[57:18] Amen. You would kind of laugh if I
[57:20] actually played you my phone while I was
[57:23] driving down the road. Amen. And boy, I
[57:25] was just having me a jubilee.
[57:28] And you would you'd say I was crazy
[57:29] probably, but I was having a pretty good
[57:31] time. Amen. You know, as the Lord was
[57:34] revealing some of these things, Amen. to
[57:35] me. Amen. But I got wrote down here,
[57:39] let's use our imagination just a little
[57:41] bit. Amen. First of all, if you lived,
[57:45] let's say, in Elton area or wherever
[57:48] area you are, just this small area all
[57:50] your life and you had never went to
[57:52] Hopkinsville, never went to Clarksville,
[57:55] never went to Dixon, Tennessee, never
[57:57] went anywhere,
[57:59] and mom, dad, somebody says, "I need you
[58:02] to go to Dixon and I need you to pick
[58:03] something up."
[58:06] You'd say, and you'd say, "It's just
[58:07] south of us." Okay.
[58:11] Now, can you imagine getting in the
[58:13] vehicle and heading out?
[58:20] It' be something else, wouldn't it? You
[58:22] you you'd say, "I don't know where it
[58:24] is. I don't know where this is."
[58:29] I told you it was south.
[58:32] Now, how many knows the the It used to
[58:35] be. Amen. Some of us probably still do.
[58:39] And that's when you go somewhere, you
[58:40] actually have a map. Folks, I I I
[58:45] congratulate you if you still do because
[58:48] we've got we've got a navigational
[58:50] system in our vehicles. Almost every
[58:52] every car about does. Isn't that right?
[58:54] A navigational system. Amen. Amen. Tells
[58:58] you how to get there. Now, the map used
[59:01] to tell you you used to go follow that
[59:03] map. Now, it's be pretty easy to teach
[59:06] somebody to just follow 79 or, you know,
[59:10] 181 to 79 and go on down and it'll take
[59:12] you into Clarksville, you know, and take
[59:15] them right there. And then, of course,
[59:16] JUST KEEP GOING FOLLOWING down through
[59:17] there and you'll you'll finally get to
[59:19] Dixon. YOU MIGHT FIND YOUR WAY WITH A
[59:22] MAP. AMEN. I got to thinking, YOU KNOW,
[59:25] THERE'S A A SONG, a gospel song that I'm
[59:27] using my Bible for a road map, and my
[59:31] last stop is heaven one of these days.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; How many believe this is our road map?
[59:37] &gt;&gt; This is our navigational system right
[59:40] here.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; And not only this, but also the Holy
[59:46] Spirit.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't matter where uh where you
[59:50] are, even in the ocean and the ships and
[59:53] all of those, they have a they have a
[59:55] navigational system and they used to go
[59:57] by what? The stars.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? In other words, to
[1:00:02] know HOW TO GET TO PLACES, they had to
[1:00:04] GO BY THE STARS. WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE
[1:00:06] NAVIGATED BY?
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; HUH?
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Those are our navigators. That's right.
[1:00:13] Amen. And the ultimate stars, of course,
[1:00:15] THE NORTH STAR. CUZ ALL THOSE STARS
[1:00:18] REFLECT FROM THE STAR AND they point you
[1:00:20] to the north star. But those have been
[1:00:22] the ones that have helped the church to
[1:00:24] navigate. Amen. In the last 2,000 years
[1:00:28] THROUGH ALL THE COMPLEXITY OF LIFE. HOW
[1:00:32] MANY KNOWS LIFE IS COMPLEX?
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; A MAP IS COMPLEX. TO GET TO SOMEWHERE,
[1:00:38] YOU'VE GOT ROADS EVERYWHERE. IT'S like
[1:00:41] spaghetti.
[1:00:43] There's just roads everywhere. And if
[1:00:45] YOU DON'T HAVE SOME LITTLE KNOWLEDGE,
[1:00:46] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU TAKE OFF
[1:00:49] without some kind of an idea or some
[1:00:51] kind of a map and you ain't never been
[1:00:53] there before, you better BE READY
[1:00:55] BECAUSE YOU'LL GET LOST. AMEN. And the
[1:00:58] one thing about our navigational system,
[1:01:00] Amen. I want to talk to you. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:03] About our n uh how did how did how did
[1:01:06] even our you know our navigational
[1:01:10] systems in our car, HOW THEY'LL THEY'LL
[1:01:12] TELL YOU. AMEN. when you're in a and
[1:01:15] they'll show you the blue line, right?
[1:01:17] AMEN. AND IT'LL TALK TO YOU. I ALWAYS
[1:01:19] LIKE TO HIT THE SPEAKER. HEY, get that
[1:01:21] speaker working. I LIKE WHEN IT TALKS TO
[1:01:23] ME.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IT'LL TELL YOU, GO PAST THIS
[1:01:27] LIGHT AND AT THE NEXT LIGHT, TAKE A
[1:01:29] RIGHT.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT? THAT'S how how how
[1:01:33] detailed it is. But now we also know and
[1:01:36] a lot of us have uh I I've heard of some
[1:01:39] people that has ended up in some kind of
[1:01:41] a cow pasture maybe because you know THE
[1:01:44] THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM ISN'T PERFECT.
[1:01:46] WHY? BECAUSE IT'S HUMANMADE.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And you might think man I didn't
[1:01:51] order I didn't put in here no Herfords
[1:01:54] or no black Angus. I had an address
[1:01:57] here. I didn't want cows. But here we
[1:01:59] are and you're like MY THIS AIN'T THE
[1:02:01] RIGHT PLACE. ISN'T IT FRUSTRATING HOW
[1:02:03] THAT YOU GET, you know, a lot of us
[1:02:06] probably have, well, here this is
[1:02:07] SUPPOSED TO BE IT, but yet it isn't it.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But how MANY KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE
[1:02:13] FOLLOWING THIS, this never mislead you.
[1:02:18] You never end up in a dead end road
[1:02:20] somewhere where you ought to be when you
[1:02:22] follow this.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; THIS GUIDANCE SYSTEM WILL GUIDE YOU,
[1:02:27] RIGHT?
[1:02:29] AMEN.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; And you need it
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; through every aspect
[1:02:36] of life.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows that as in the
[1:02:40] natural realm, Amen. In the natural
[1:02:43] realm,
[1:02:45] Amen. We know that brother Bam says, you
[1:02:46] know, WHEN HE PREACHED ON LEADERSHIP, he
[1:02:48] talks about how that he says, YOU KNOW,
[1:02:51] YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO
[1:02:53] GUIDE YOU, TO lead you, to help you.
[1:02:55] Amen. It is a child. Amen. And when you
[1:02:58] begin to walk it, mama will hold that
[1:03:00] little uh child's hand. Amen. And try to
[1:03:03] get it TO WALK A LITTLE AND go a little
[1:03:04] walking. And and after it gets so good,
[1:03:07] all of a sudden it tries TO WALK ON ITS
[1:03:09] OWN. AND NOW, BUT IT'LL FALL DOWN and
[1:03:12] and guess what? Mama comes over and help
[1:03:15] picks it up. Got to try again. AMEN.

[1:03:19] AND AS YOU GO THROUGH YOUR TEENAGE
[1:03:21] YEARS, WELL, that's a little bit more
[1:03:22] complex. Amen. You need a mom. You need
[1:03:25] a dad. YOU NEED SOMEBODY THAT'LL TALK TO
[1:03:27] YOU AND EXPLAIN THINGS to you because
[1:03:29] you've got emotions. YOU'VE GOT ALL
[1:03:30] KINDS of things to go through. How many
[1:03:33] believe we are our our natural realm of
[1:03:35] see, taste, feel, hear, and smell. It's
[1:03:37] a whole lot of roads. Amen. It's a whole
[1:03:39] lot of avenues. Amen. And if you don't
[1:03:42] KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THAT STUFF,
[1:03:46] you'll end up in a lot of trouble.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Your reasoning, your memory, your
[1:03:51] conscience, and all of that.
[1:03:54] it. You got to really KNOW HOW TO
[1:03:56] NAVIGATE THROUGH those things. It's not
[1:03:58] easy and you need a guide. You need
[1:04:01] something to direct you. Amen. Praise
[1:04:05] the Lord.

[1:04:20] HOW ABRAHAM SAID YOU OUGHT TO PRAY ABOUT
[1:04:22] IT.
[1:04:23] THAT'S RIGHT. YOU need to you need to
[1:04:25] FIND THE RIGHT ONE BECAUSE IF YOU FIND
[1:04:27] THE WRONG ONE, you're going to be in a
[1:04:28] lot of trouble. IT'S GOING TO BE WATER

[1:04:57] he guides us. Amen. Amen. You get
[1:05:01] married and have children. Amen. And all
[1:05:04] even marriage can be complex. Ain't that
[1:05:06] right?
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. In a life of sacrifice and
[1:05:10] not just about you now it's about the
[1:05:12] other person and it can be complex and
[1:05:14] you need to navigate THROUGH ALL OF IT.
[1:05:16] NAVIGATE THROUGH MARRIAGE PROBLEMS.
[1:05:18] AMEN. AMEN. AS A PASTOR, I KNOW I'VE HAD
[1:05:21] TO NAVIGATE THROUGH A WHOLE LOT OF

[1:06:06] AMEN. YOU CAN'T HARDLY PICK YOUR FOOT UP
[1:06:08] TO GO UP THE STEPS ANYMORE. And you fall
[1:06:10] right flat face into the steps and say,
[1:06:13] "Man, I can't even lift my feet anymore.
[1:06:16] How do I navigate through this? This is
[1:06:18] frustrating. Getting old can be
[1:06:20] frustrating, people.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. You got to learn to
[1:06:25] accept. YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT HAVE HEALTH
[1:06:26] PROBLEMS. YOU MIGHT HAVE ISSUE this and
[1:06:28] issue that. Amen. It's something that
[1:06:31] YOU GOT TO DEAL WITH. SAY, "I've had
[1:06:33] that. Things come upon you not used to."
[1:06:35] And uh you know
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; you GOT TO NAVIGATE THROUGH ALL OF that
[1:06:41] and try to keep a smile.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Try to stay happy.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; How many believe you can? How many's
[1:06:49] glad that you can?
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; You can stay up. You can keep your joy.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] Thanks be to God.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God.
[1:07:04] because we can.
[1:07:07] [sighs and gasps]
[1:07:10] I want to How many remembers brother
[1:07:12] Brandham teaching that there's seven
[1:07:15] dimensions? Might see seem off the
[1:07:18] course a little bit, but we're going
[1:07:20] somewhere. The seven dimensions, the
[1:07:22] first three being light are time,
[1:07:24] matter, and space. Time, matter, and
[1:07:27] space.
[1:07:31] And you know, even if we didn't have a
[1:07:33] clock to tell us that we're in time, how
[1:07:35] many knows we'd know that we're in time?
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Our hair would turn gray. We'd get
[1:07:40] older. Sun would go up, sun would go
[1:07:43] down. Amen. It's time. But somehow they
[1:07:46] have put it into a clock and put 12
[1:07:50] hands on it. Not hands, but 12 numbers.
[1:08:01] And they made it 12 noon and then 12 to
[1:08:06] midnight. I don't know why they didn't
[1:08:07] just go with 24 of them. Go a little
[1:08:10] slower and put 24 up in there. That was
[1:08:12] just a new idea. But anyway,
[1:08:16] that's right. So, they have 12. And by
[1:08:18] that, we know that we're in time. How
[1:08:19] many knows we're in time?
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Adam and Eve when they
[1:08:23] sinned, how many know we were dropped
[1:08:25] DOWN IN TIME. BEFORE THAT, WE WERE IN
[1:08:29] ETERNITY. THERE WAS NO CLOCKS TO GO BY.
[1:08:32] They were in eternity and we were
[1:08:34] dropped down into time. MATTER OF
[1:08:37] COURSE, IT'S JUST HERE WE ARE. WE'RE IN
[1:08:39] MATTER. Everything's everything that is
[1:08:41] is is tangible, material. Amen. It's
[1:08:44] matter.
[1:08:46] Amen. And unfortunately, Hitler thought
[1:08:49] that we were all just matter. And Amen.
[1:08:51] Did he go into towns and wipe every
[1:08:53] living soul out? Ain't that right? He
[1:08:56] was ruthless. He was terrible.
[1:09:00] Wiped everybody out. Amen.
[1:09:04] AND ACTING TREATED THEM LIKE ANIMALS,
[1:09:06] LIKE THEY'RE JUST MATTER. But how many
[1:09:08] knows WE'RE MORE THAN JUST MATTER?
[1:09:12] There's down in here there's a soul.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Those people out, they were souls.
[1:09:18] Amen. And the other one, of course, is
[1:09:21] space. Just a space out there. Amen. I
[1:09:26] mean, think about it from here to there.
[1:09:28] And it's, you know, it's, you know, it'd
[1:09:30] be nice to be able to just travel by
[1:09:32] thought, but we can't. We have to have
[1:09:34] vehicles and so forth to, Amen. to uh
[1:09:39] close the distance or get to where we're
[1:09:42] going. and going from this place to the
[1:09:44] other place. Amen. Has to do with Amen.
[1:09:47] our travelings and so forth. Amen. Then
[1:09:50] he talks about the fourth dimension. The
[1:09:53] fourth dimension he says is is in the
[1:09:55] realm of radio,
[1:09:58] television, sound going through this
[1:10:01] room.
[1:10:02] Is that right?
[1:10:04] All kinds of sounds, pictures, and
[1:10:06] everything else. And everything's going
[1:10:08] through here and we just can't see it.
[1:10:10] How many knows if God would give you the
[1:10:12] crystals in your eyes, Amen. like a like
[1:10:15] a television, the right tube, you'd be
[1:10:17] able to see it.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that God gives a
[1:10:21] prophet? AND THAT PROPHET was born with
[1:10:25] his subconscience, like his dream world
[1:10:28] and the NATURAL WORLD SO CLOSE TOGETHER
[1:10:30] THAT he could, so to speak, dream while
[1:10:32] he was standing IN THE PULPIT. AMEN. GOD
[1:10:35] WOULD SHOW HIM VISIONS.
[1:10:38] AMEN. The light would come. THERE'S
[1:10:39] ANGELS. ALL OF THOSE THERE'S THAT
[1:10:41] DIMENSION IN THAT REALM. AMEN. BUT RADIO
[1:10:44] AND ALSO BROTHER BAM SAID YOU KNOW that
[1:10:46] even demons are in that fourth
[1:10:48] dimension.
[1:10:52] Didn't he say cancer was a
[1:10:53] fourthdimensional disease and the cancer
[1:10:56] is actually demons.
[1:10:58] And there's something that I don't know
[1:11:00] how to teach really because uh I know
[1:11:03] that brother Ben one place he taught
[1:11:05] those different dimensions of three
[1:11:07] going this way and then three going that
[1:11:09] way or whatever and that middle one
[1:11:11] would have to be four I guess and I
[1:11:12] don't know just how to do all that. So
[1:11:14] we'll just stay with kind of the way he
[1:11:16] he brought it. Okay.
[1:11:19] Uh in in in one area anyway. The fourth
[1:11:21] dimension will be that. The fifth
[1:11:23] dimension he said was the regions of the
[1:11:25] lost.
[1:11:29] Fourth dimension is the regions of the
[1:11:30] lost
[1:11:32] where people that are not saved are.
[1:11:35] It's a terrible place.
[1:11:39] Amen.
[1:11:42] And then in the sixth dimension,
[1:11:45] sixth dimension is the saved. It's where
[1:11:48] he went. How many knows he went into
[1:11:50] that dimension when he was lifted up
[1:11:52] from his bed and went and SEEN THE SOULS
[1:11:55] OF THOSE THAT ARE SAVED UNDER THE ALTAR
[1:11:58] RIGHT IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD.
[1:12:01] AMEN. Got over there and THERE AIN'T
[1:12:02] NOTHING BUT PERFECT LOVE IN that
[1:12:04] dimension.
[1:12:06] Ain't nobody has one WRONG THOUGHT
[1:12:09] THERE. NO ill feelings, no hurts, no
[1:12:12] pains, no nothing in that dimension.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; That's just above us.
[1:12:17] Ain't that right? AND THEN THERE'S THE
[1:12:20] SEVENTH DIMENSION where Jesus is
[1:12:22] himself.
[1:12:23] NOW, BROTHER BRANDON, one place WHEN HE
[1:12:25] WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE'S A trinity of
[1:12:28] the devil where the regions of the lost
[1:12:30] are. There's the demons and then there's
[1:12:32] hell itself. And up this way he says is
[1:12:35] the regions of uh of the the Holy
[1:12:38] Spirit. Amen. The saved AND THEN WHERE
[1:12:40] CHRIST HIMSELF IS LIKE A TRINITY.
[1:12:44] AMEN.
[1:12:46] both of them. And this is what he said.
[1:12:49] Now notice like this street here, here
[1:12:52] where there's mortals live, where these
[1:12:54] mortals live. How many knows he's
[1:12:56] talking about matter now where we are
[1:13:00] where mortals are influenced. We're
[1:13:02] influenced by an outside world.
[1:13:08] I should understand by the grace of God.
[1:13:10] I deal with spirits and I SHOULD KNOW
[1:13:13] WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. GOD. HOW MANY
[1:13:14] BELIEVE THAT? AMEN. HE WOULD WATCH A
[1:13:17] CERTAIN SPIRIT OF uh epilepsy or
[1:13:20] whatever it might be. And he had
[1:13:21] everybody CLOSE YOUR EYES. DON'T OPEN
[1:13:23] IT. Because for some reason, I guess if
[1:13:26] YOU GOT YOUR EYES OPEN and he would cast
[1:13:28] that out, THEY COULD COME INTO YOU.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; I don't know how. Can't just explain it
[1:13:34] why, but I don't know about you, but I'd
[1:13:35] shut my eye.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Close your eyes. of the disrespectful
[1:13:41] pastor in his church one time was in THE
[1:13:43] BALCONY WOULDN'T DO IT AND THE WHOLE
[1:13:46] BUNCH WAS GOT INTO AN EPILEPTIC FIT.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; HELLO. BECAUSE THEY WERE DISRESPECTFUL
[1:13:52] and when HE CAST IT OUT OF SOMEBODY they
[1:13:54] went into them people.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; So he knows that people are influenced
[1:14:01] by another world.
[1:14:05] Amen.
[1:14:08] Oh my.
[1:14:10] And I look THROUGH THIS DARK MASS of
[1:14:12] gaity. And every once in a while, now
[1:14:15] notice he WAS KIND OF SAYING, let's say
[1:14:16] it's just black as night in here. Amen.
[1:14:20] Of gaity. Every once in a while, YOU'LL
[1:14:22] SEE LITTLE LIGHTS BURNING. That's right.
[1:14:25] There you are. It's your table today.
[1:14:28] Lights are burning. That's the Christian
[1:14:30] IN THE DARKNESS GIVING LIGHT.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW MANY BELIEVE THERE'S DARKNESS
[1:14:37] EVERYWHERE WHERE YOU WORK, WHERE YOU GO,
[1:14:40] IN YOUR HOME, YOU'RE THAT LITTLE SPECK
[1:14:43] OF LIGHT?
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:47] So he says, now look at this here. Now
[1:14:50] he says, the sinner is influenced by the
[1:14:53] spirit because he has a spirit and the
[1:14:56] wrong gives influence. Amen. And the
[1:14:59] right gives influence. IN OTHER WORDS,
[1:15:02] IT'S SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU,
[1:15:04] influences you, THAT GUIDES YOU, THAT
[1:15:07] CAUSES YOU TO do what you do,
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; powered by it. Those are that are
[1:15:14] dominated by blackness and separation
[1:15:17] are dominated from the underworld of
[1:15:21] devils.
[1:15:23] TELL ME SOMETHING. WHAT IS THE WORLD
[1:15:25] INFLUENCED BY? WHAT ARE THEY GUIDED BY?
[1:15:28] They're guided by the underworld
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; of devils.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; That's why they act like they do. THAT'S
[1:15:37] WHY THEY THINK LIKE they do. That's why
[1:15:40] they do like they do.
[1:15:43] Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; The underworld of devils.
[1:15:47] Now notice now the first thing you know
[1:15:49] when you're going out this line.
[1:15:52] Amen. Get this straight. Here's where
[1:15:53] mortals live. A whole conglomeration of
[1:15:56] blackness and darkness. little lights
[1:15:58] placed in there now and then he says now
[1:16:00] that's Christians born again of light we
[1:16:04] are said on a hill a candle him in a
[1:16:07] room gives light to the room now notice
[1:16:10] now the wicked or the unbeliever is
[1:16:12] influenced from beneath he says there's
[1:16:14] a trinity of hell like there's a trinity
[1:16:16] of heaven they're influenced by evil
[1:16:20] powers
[1:16:22] then the first thing as you start down
[1:16:24] the first thing you find in the realm
[1:16:26] there amen you got the unsaved where and
[1:16:28] that that's where Jesus went and sold to
[1:16:30] the soul preached to the souls that were
[1:16:32] in prison that repented not in a long
[1:16:34] suffering in the days of Noah. Next is
[1:16:37] demons. Next is hell itself. The world
[1:16:39] is influenced
[1:16:41] by these demon powers through a trinity.
[1:16:45] And the Christian is influenced by a
[1:16:50] spirit too.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; My scripture that I didn't read, I want
[1:16:56] to read now. For as many as are led by
[1:16:59] the spirit of God, they are the sons of
[1:17:03] God. How many believe it's important
[1:17:05] THAT YOU ARE LED BY THE spirit of God?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; The world in WHICH WE ARE LIVING IN IT
[1:17:12] IS COMPLEX. THERE'S A LOT OF TWISTS.
[1:17:14] There's a lot of turns. There's a lot of
[1:17:16] curves in this life.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you NEED THE HOLY SPIRIT TO
[1:17:21] lead you, to guide you.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THOSE TURNS. BROTHER B ONE
[1:17:27] place he SAYS IF YOU NEGLECT THE TURN
[1:17:29] AND TURN A CORNER YOU WILL WRECK.
[1:17:35] AMEN.
[1:17:36] So we find we find there's a lot of
[1:17:40] people that wreck.
[1:17:44] Amen. Remember just Judith Judith Potter
[1:17:48] out here on Stringtown Road going home
[1:17:50] one foggy night come out to the end of
[1:17:52] Stringtown. Y'all know it's a T. Well,
[1:17:55] she come up to the T and she was going
[1:17:58] too fast. [laughter]
[1:17:59] Poor thing. She was all right, BUT SHE
[1:18:02] COME OVER THERE AND JUST, MAN, slammed
[1:18:04] her car into the ditch. Amen.
[1:18:10] Amen. And if you aren't careful,
[1:18:12] when there's a curve and you don't turn,
[1:18:15] what are you going to do?
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; You're going to crash. You're going to
[1:18:20] wreck up. Praise the Lord.
[1:18:23] So my point was here, amen, is that
[1:18:27] we're influenced or led by or powered by
[1:18:31] one or the other worlds. And that is
[1:18:33] listen to this. It is most miserable.
[1:18:37] It's most miserable. It's and devil
[1:18:39] devils are miserable out there by
[1:18:41] theirel. They're not happy unless they
[1:18:44] can inhabit somebody.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; I don't think people are HAPPY UNLESS
[1:18:49] THEY HAVE SOMETHING IN THEIR HEART.
[1:18:51] AMEN.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU THINK THEY TATTOOED
[1:18:55] THEMSELVES, PUT MORE THIS OR THE other
[1:18:58] and AND DO ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS?
[1:19:01] To be empty is terrible.
[1:19:05] AND THAT'S WHAT the other empty.
[1:19:08] And the only WAY TO GET FILLED IS TO GET
[1:19:10] FILLED WITH SOME EVIL SPIRIT. AND WHEN
[1:19:13] THEY'RE TIRED OF THAT SPIRIT, THEY
[1:19:14] INVITE MORE SPIRITS IN. AND AFTER a
[1:19:16] while, they're just a terrible thing.
[1:19:19] Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I was saying A WHILE AGO,
[1:19:22] IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT AMEN. AS A a as a
[1:19:26] child,
[1:19:28] as a child to have Christian parents to
[1:19:32] teach you, right? To get you on the
[1:19:35] right road.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; You see why we have to pity our young
[1:19:39] people? We have to pity our young people
[1:19:42] out in the world.
[1:19:45] They're our fellow Americans.
[1:19:48] They're our brothers AND OUR SISTERS. AS
[1:19:50] FAR AS A NATION AS OUR AMERICANS. But
[1:19:52] brother Bam SAID, "LOOK AT WHERE THE
[1:19:53] PARENTS ARE. IT'S PARENT DELINQUENCY.
[1:19:55] THEY'RE NOT GUIDING THEM. AND NOW THEY
[1:19:58] HAVEN'T HAD A GUIDE. NOW THEY DON'T KNOW
[1:20:00] WHO they are. WHERE THEY THEY'RE OUT
[1:20:02] THERE IN CHAOS.
[1:20:04] AIN'T THAT RIGHT?
[1:20:08] God help them."
[1:20:10] But they don't have to be cuz God's got
[1:20:13] a way for them.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; How many's glad for that? WE OUGHT TO BE
[1:20:17] HAPPY TONIGHT BECAUSE GOD HAS HELPED
[1:20:20] YOU. GOD HAS SHOWED YOU THE WAY. YOUNG
[1:20:22] PEOPLE, YOU OUGHT TO BE GLAD FOR GODLY
[1:20:24] PARENTS TO TRY TO TEACH YOU AND GUIDE
[1:20:26] YOU ON THE RIGHT PATH.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:35] So this way, it's a narrow way. How many
[1:20:40] believes it? It's a narrow way. It's a
[1:20:42] harder way. Not an easy way. Why?
[1:20:45] because you have to die to yourself.
[1:20:54] You realize
[1:21:01] that if you have self-control,
[1:21:05] if you have self-control,
[1:21:13] then you
[1:21:16] are more powerful
[1:21:19] than if you fought the devil.
[1:21:24] If you fought the devil himself,
[1:21:26] it would be as much as you overcoming
[1:21:30] yourself.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; What did brother Bam said was your
[1:21:36] greatest enemy? He didn't say the devil.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; No, it's yourself. Look in the mirror.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Why? because he was defeated at Calvary.
[1:21:44] Ain't that right? But you have to
[1:21:47] overcome yourself. So if you can
[1:21:49] overcome yourself
[1:21:51] and actually bring yourself into the
[1:21:54] control of the Holy Spirit, you are that
[1:21:58] mighty warrior that brother Tommy puts
[1:22:00] up here sometime of great gladiator, a
[1:22:03] great shield and a great warrior.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Paul was like that. That was Paul. He
[1:22:08] had conquered himself. He had taken the
[1:22:11] sword of the word and cut himself down.
[1:22:14] Amen. And he was yielded into the hands
[1:22:16] of God. Amen.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:24] You see
[1:22:26] this turn. Sometimes there's many turns
[1:22:29] in life, whether it's teenager,
[1:22:32] marriage, midlife, old age, decisions
[1:22:36] you got to make in that. How many knows
[1:22:39] that when brother Brandon preached on
[1:22:41] Zakius being in the tree and being where
[1:22:44] there's two branches
[1:22:46] and he was making a choice and he wanted
[1:22:48] to see Jesus, you know, he says and
[1:22:51] that's like two choices. Two road where
[1:22:53] two roads meet. The choices we make are
[1:22:56] where roads it's like at a crossroad.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. HOW MANY BELIEVES IT'S IMPORTANT
[1:23:02] TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE TO CHOOSE THE
[1:23:05] RIGHT ROAD?
[1:23:08] AMEN. Because one leads to destruction,
[1:23:11] many going there at Amen.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; But the choices that we make
[1:23:19] determines which road that we take.
[1:23:24] And even Malachi 4 said that he came to
[1:23:27] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:23:30] children. How many knows those
[1:23:32] Israelites, the Pharisees, THEY COULDN'T
[1:23:34] TURN? THEY JUST COULDN'T TURN.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; NO, THEY JUST COULDN'T DO IT.
[1:23:42] But the purpose was THAT HE HAD TO GO TO
[1:23:44] THE children
[1:23:46] to the apostles
[1:23:49] TO CHRIST FROM THE LAW TO GRACE.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; And what did they do? They wrecked up
[1:23:56] because they couldn't make that turn.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:03] When Luther came out out of reformation
[1:24:06] AND HE BEGAN TO PREACH AND HE HAD A
[1:24:08] AUDIENCE WITH THE POPE AND THEY
[1:24:10] CHALLENGED his intellect and everything
[1:24:12] else,
[1:24:14] HE WAS TRYING TO TURN THEM, HEY, THE
[1:24:16] JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH. THIS PAYING
[1:24:18] FOR YOUR SINS AND ALL OF THAT, IT AIN'T
[1:24:20] IN THE BIBLE.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; How many knows? HE GAVE HER SPACE TO
[1:24:24] REPENT, BUT SHE DIDN'T REPENT. SHE WOULD
[1:24:27] NOT TURN THE CORNER.
[1:24:34] WHY? AND SO LUTHERAN COME OUT
[1:24:38] BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS A STRAIGHT SHOT.
[1:24:40] HOW MANY I KNOW THAT IN THIS IN THIS
[1:24:42] PATH IN THIS ROAD THAT WE GO, IT'S NOT
[1:24:45] EXACTLY A STRAIGHT. IT HAS CURVES. IT
[1:24:47] HAS HILLS.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; LIFE IS LIKE A MOUNTAIN RAILROAD.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, he's a good he he could
[1:24:54] do you a good Sunday school on pilgrims
[1:24:56] progress of Amen. going through this
[1:24:59] swamp and the swamp of uh despair and
[1:25:02] all THESE OTHER AREAS TRYING TO CLIMB
[1:25:04] THIS MOUNTAIN WITH THIS BIG HEAVY
[1:25:06] WEIGHT.
[1:25:08] AMEN.
[1:25:11] OH, I trust everybody's got rid of your
[1:25:13] weight.
[1:25:16] Amen.
[1:25:18] But choices that they make, Luther came
[1:25:21] out.
[1:25:24] Amen. And what DID THEY DO? THEY GOT SO
[1:25:27] TRADITIONALIZED, so set in their ways.
[1:25:31] Is that right? How many of you believe
[1:25:32] that you got to be careful about that?
[1:25:35] YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT'S
[1:25:36] GOING TO come and and DO SOMETHING THAT
[1:25:40] YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THE HOW MANY KNOWS WHEN THE h
[1:25:46] in in the time of Israel when the WHEN
[1:25:48] THE PILLAR OF FIRE MOVED,
[1:25:51] they were to move. LET'S GO. LET'S GO.
[1:25:53] LET'S GO. FOLLOW THE PILLAR OF FIRE.
[1:25:55] WHEN HE STOPPED, THEY CAN'T.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that the way IT IS IN LIFE? AMEN.
[1:26:00] WHEN YOU COME TO A STOP SIGN, IT'D BE
[1:26:02] BETTER FOR YOU TO STOP.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And if THE GREEN LIGHTS GOING, I'M
[1:26:06] TELLING YOU WHAT, WON'T TAKE LONG.
[1:26:08] SOMEBODY going to blow the horn at you.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; GO STOP WHAT WHEN HE SAYS TO DO.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Life is like that.
[1:26:23] WESLEY I MEAN LUTHER GOT SO SO SET IN
[1:26:26] HIS WAYS PUT A PERIOD WHAT BEHIND HIM
[1:26:28] BELIEVE IN WESLEY COME ALONG AIN'T THAT
[1:26:30] RIGHT WESLEYANS COME ALONG BE
[1:26:32] SANCTIFICATION MORE THAN JUST
[1:26:34] JUSTIFICATION WE GOT TO GO DEEPER NOW
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; LET'S KEEP ON GOING IF YOU GOING TO
[1:26:41] FLORIDA YOU CAN'T STOP IN ATLANTA YOU
[1:26:43] CAN'T STOP IN CHATTANOOGA
[1:26:45] hello but that's what they did they
[1:26:48] stopped
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; they didn't keep doing.
[1:26:54] Imagine trying to go to Florida without
[1:26:56] a map, without a GPS, without anything.
[1:26:59] Hey, go down to Florida and pick this
[1:27:01] up. You ain't never been there before.
[1:27:03] You'd probably end up in California.
[1:27:07] Ain't no telling where you'd end up. Can
[1:27:10] I say something tonight? Without Jesus
[1:27:12] Christ, there ain't no telling where
[1:27:14] you're going to end up at.
[1:27:17] Without the Holy Spirit for your guiding
[1:27:19] system,
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; there's no telling where you are going
[1:27:22] to end up at.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit will never mislead you.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; He won't misguide you.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; How many knows that this way, this road,
[1:27:34] this the the way of holiness,
[1:27:37] Amen. It's a one-way street.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. A ONE-WAY STREET. AND WHERE ARE
[1:27:44] YOU SUPPOSED TO WALK ON THIS STREET?
[1:27:47] Where are you supposed to walk on it?
[1:27:49] Right side, left side.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Middle.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; The middle, right? That's right. DOWN
[1:27:55] THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. SOMEBODY SAID,
[1:27:56] "BROTHER BRANDON, MAN, you're going to
[1:27:57] get hit if you go down the middle of the
[1:27:59] road." Amen. You know,
[1:28:02] and he says, "Nah, what you fail to
[1:28:04] realize is is a one-way street.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Everybody's going down the same way."
[1:28:09] AND GUESS WHAT? IT PITCHES A ROAD
[1:28:12] PITCHES.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? AND THERE'S A LOT OF
[1:28:15] PEOPLE THAT GO OFF TO THE RIGHT. HOW
[1:28:17] MANY KNOWS IF YOU GO OFF INTO FANATICISM
[1:28:20] INTO EMOTIONALISM,
[1:28:22] you're going to end up wrecked
[1:28:23] [screaming] up.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; WELL, MY GRACIOUS. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU,
[1:28:28] WE HAD SUCH A SHOUTING, SCREAMING,
[1:28:30] RUNNING DIALS, AND DANCING TIME. AMEN.
[1:28:33] AND TONIGHT, IT'S JUST SO BORING, you
[1:28:36] can't barely hear. Amen.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Boy, I'm telling you what, that church
[1:28:41] is dead.
[1:28:43] I need to find me a new church.
[1:28:47] Huh? You're going to know what you're
[1:28:49] going to do? You're going to end up
[1:28:50] wrecked up.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not about
[1:28:55] emotionalism.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Even though I like it,
[1:28:59] you like it.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; But there's there's hilltops, there's
[1:29:04] valleys,
[1:29:06] all kinds of places that you go through.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:11] And then the other side HE SAYS IF
[1:29:13] PEOPLE GO OFF AND THEY END UP WRECKED
[1:29:14] UP.
[1:29:17] AMEN. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT PENTECOST? LET
[1:29:19] ME FINISH MY OTHER STORY. AMEN.
[1:29:20] PENTECOST. AMEN. COME ALONG AND EVEN
[1:29:23] WESLEY COULDN'T TURN THE CORNER. HOW
[1:29:26] MANY ALL OF YOU WESLEY AND ALL OF THE
[1:29:28] LUTHERAN?
[1:29:30] All of Luther. ALL OF WESLEY. THEY
[1:29:32] SHOULD ALL BECOME [screaming]
[1:29:33] PENTECOSTALS.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. THEY SHOULD ALL BECOME
[1:29:39] PENTECOSTAL. THAT'S WHERE GOD WAS ON
[1:29:42] ISUZA STREET.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; GOD was doing this. It was his doing.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I like to be
[1:29:50] where it's God's doing.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Not my doing,
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; but his doing.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BROTHER BRANDHAM TRIED TO TELL
[1:30:01] THEM, "NO, NO, NO. The evidence OF THE
[1:30:03] HOLY GHOST AND MEANING THAT YOU'RE SAVED
[1:30:05] IS NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU SPEAK IN
[1:30:07] TONGUES." THEY WOULD BEAT YOU ON THE
[1:30:09] BACK. THEY'D PRAY WITH YOU AND SLAP YOU
[1:30:11] UPSIDE THE HEAD. WHATEVER THEY HAD TO DO
[1:30:13] UNTIL YOU BEGIN.
[1:30:22] You don't know what I'm talking about,
[1:30:23] do you? That's what I said in Amish. BUT
[1:30:25] THEY WOULD SPEAK IN TONGUES.
[1:30:28] RAISE somebody heard and understood.
[1:30:31] But anyway,
[1:30:33] then he said, "No, that's not it." Why?
[1:30:35] cuz he's SEEN WITCH DOCTORS AND
[1:30:37] EVERYBODY ELSE SPEAK IN TONGUES AND
[1:30:38] WRITE UNKNOWN TONGUES AND EVERYTHING
[1:30:40] ELSE. IT'S FURTHER. IT'S DEEPER THAN
[1:30:43] THAT. BUT THEY COULD NOT TURN THE CORNER
[1:30:46] IN 63 AND THEY PUT HIM OUT.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And what did they do?
[1:30:52] They wrecked [screaming] up.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THEY DID NOT FOLLOW THE
[1:30:58] NAVIGATOR.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; The g navigational system. Hallelujah.
[1:31:06] That's right.
[1:31:09] Wrecked up because of it.
[1:31:13] Amen. How many know even brother
[1:31:15] Brandham had to make a choice.
[1:31:22] Brother Brandon was preaching and he was
[1:31:23] just really tearing into the churches
[1:31:26] and the things they were doing wrong and
[1:31:28] everything. and Danny Henry, I believe
[1:31:30] it was, come up,
[1:31:32] you know, and he come up there and said,
[1:31:35] "That could be added to the book of
[1:31:36] Revelations. Let me pray for you." And
[1:31:39] he went to laying his hands on brother
[1:31:40] Brandham and praying for him, and he
[1:31:42] began to speak in tongues.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Remember that? Begin to speak in
[1:31:47] tongues. And there was another French
[1:31:50] woman, I guess, or another A COUPLE MORE
[1:31:53] SPOKE IN TONGUES. AND THERE WAS ANOTHER
[1:31:54] ONE, A LADY in there that was French.
[1:31:56] She says, "That's not tongues. That's
[1:31:58] perfect French."
[1:32:00] Is that right? He spoke in French.
[1:32:04] AMEN. INSTEAD OF PRAYING FOR BROTHER
[1:32:05] BRANDHAM THAT, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE FELT
[1:32:07] LIKE HE WAS WRONG,
[1:32:10] he spoke in tongues.
[1:32:12] And this is the prophecy or the what he
[1:32:15] said. HE SAYS BECAUSE THOU HAS CHOSEN
[1:32:18] THE NARROW PATH.
[1:32:21] BECAUSE THOU HAS CHOSEN THE NARROW PATH,
[1:32:23] THE HARDER WAY.
[1:32:26] THOU HAST WALKED of thine own choosing.
[1:32:29] Oh my. He says, I I can get that. All
[1:32:32] right. See, you choose yourself. CHOS
[1:32:35] MOSES HAD MADE A CHOICE. HE didn't have
[1:32:38] to. NEITHER DID I HAVE TO TAKE THIS
[1:32:41] PATH.
[1:32:42] I COULD HAVE HAD BIG BUILDINGS OUT
[1:32:44] YONDER LIKE SOME of them. Scott
[1:32:49] could HAVE BEEN FLYING ALL AROUND the uh
[1:32:51] United States. I COULD HAVE BE ALL
[1:32:52] ACROSS ON TELEVISION.
[1:32:54] But who would sponsor me with me tearing
[1:32:56] up their very foundation?
[1:32:59] Remember that one preacher CAME TO HIM
[1:33:01] SAYS, "BROTHER BANNON, WE WANT TO
[1:33:02] SPONSOR YOU. WE WANT TO GET TO A PLANE
[1:33:04] AND WE WANT TO HIT ALL THESE HIGH SPOTS,
[1:33:08] nerve centers."
[1:33:10] They want it to be big.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. When somebody
[1:33:13] wants to be big, it's not Christ.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. When there's big eyes and little
[1:33:20] U's and I'm much bigger than you, that's
[1:33:23] not the message that Brother Brandham
[1:33:24] taught. He says there's no big eyes and
[1:33:26] little U's. We're all on the same level.
[1:33:28] We're all brothers and sisters. I
[1:33:30] thought, you know, I thought about any
[1:33:32] of us. We're equal.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Let's all say that we're equal.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; No big eyes and little U's. That's the
[1:33:42] devil. That's pride
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; that wants to make people feel like
[1:33:47] they're bigger than anybody else. And
[1:33:48] this one's bigger than that one. No, no,
[1:33:50] no, no. Don't even go to that. Cuz if
[1:33:52] you really want to think that you're
[1:33:53] big, you remember what Jesus said. Amen.
[1:33:56] Let him that is the greatest be servant
[1:33:58] of all.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the greatest. And what did HE
[1:34:01] DO? WENT DOWN THERE AND WASHED HIS THE
[1:34:04] DISCIPLES FEET JUST OFF THE TOP OF HIS
[1:34:08] HEAD OR WHATEVER FOREVER. HE KNEW WHY HE
[1:34:10] WAS DOING IT. HE WAS GIVING THEM AN
[1:34:11] EXAMPLE THAT YOU SHOULD DO AS I HAVE
[1:34:13] DONE UNTO YOU.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; PETER SAID, "NEVER. YOU AIN'T NO
[1:34:17] FOOTWATCH FLUNKY OF MINE.
[1:34:20] If I watch you not ask no part with me.
[1:34:23] Amen.
[1:34:25] But he chose. BROTHER BRANDON DIDN'T
[1:34:27] CHOOSE to have all this.
[1:34:31] [sighs]
[1:34:32] Amen. I don't have Listen, that's right.
[1:34:35] I I'd be tearing down that very
[1:34:37] foundation. But one thing, I DON'T HAVE
[1:34:39] to bow down to nobody's feet but the
[1:34:41] Lord Jesus Christ. That's right. I CAN
[1:34:44] PREACH WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. I DON'T HAVE
[1:34:46] TO COMPROMISE WITH THEIR organizations
[1:34:48] because I don't belong to them. I MADE
[1:34:51] THE CHOICE. AMEN. Just like he said, as
[1:34:54] I was with Moses, so will I be with
[1:34:56] thee. Amen. Moses made his choice. AMEN.
[1:35:00] BECAUSE THOU HAS CHOSEN THE NARROW PATH,
[1:35:02] THE HARDER WAY, THOU has walked in there
[1:35:04] walked of your own choosing. Now this
[1:35:06] man, watch how he's how it's wrote. You
[1:35:09] see what it's wrote in foreign words?
[1:35:11] That has picked the correct and precise
[1:35:13] decision. and it is my way.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY IN HERE CAN THINK OF TIMES THAT
[1:35:21] YOU HAVE CHOSEN THE WRONG WAY?
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Chose the wrong path.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; We've all done it. If you're human, YOU
[1:35:31] AIN'T going to but make a mistake
[1:35:33] sometime and choose the wrong path.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; But one thing's for sure is you'll say,
[1:35:41] "Lord, help me. I want to choose the
[1:35:42] right path. Help me to make the right
[1:35:45] choice.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Very, very important. How many knows Eve
[1:35:51] chose the wrong road and he'd let her to
[1:35:54] her wreck. Amen. David, even a temporary
[1:35:58] wreck, a small wreck. David had a man
[1:36:00] after own God's own God. WHEN HE CHOSE
[1:36:02] TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD, it led to a lot of
[1:36:06] destruction, lot of humiliation. It was
[1:36:08] terrible.
[1:36:10] When we choose wrong roads, things don't
[1:36:13] turn out so good.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Let's choose the right path.
[1:36:22] No, I like this. I like this. I've
[1:36:24] always said I've always thought that it
[1:36:26] was this, but I never I didn't I don't I
[1:36:30] don't know. Maybe the back of my mind,
[1:36:31] but brother Random actually kind of
[1:36:33] bears it out.
[1:36:35] Th walked of thy own choosing. Now this
[1:36:38] man, now watch, he wrote this. He says,
[1:36:40] "Thou has picked the correct and price
[1:36:41] decision, AND IT'S MY WAY." BLESS GOD.
[1:36:44] It's my way. He says, because of this
[1:36:45] momentous decision, a huge portion of
[1:36:49] heaven awaits thee.
[1:36:52] He says he had never heard about the
[1:36:54] vision. See, I always thought that it's
[1:36:57] those millions
[1:36:59] of souls that are going to be in heaven.
[1:37:03] Listen to what Brother Bram said.
[1:37:06] He never heard about that vision. You
[1:37:07] see, you remember the vision? huge
[1:37:10] portion of heaven awaits thee. What a
[1:37:12] glorious decision thou has made. This in
[1:37:17] itself will bring to pass and which will
[1:37:20] give and make come to pass their their
[1:37:23] tremendous victory in love divine.
[1:37:25] That's the part he didn't really know
[1:37:27] what was what it was. We can't say. But
[1:37:31] I do know that because he made the right
[1:37:34] choice,
[1:37:36] we'll be there, too. How many believe
[1:37:38] he'll be there?
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; We're his converts.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; It would have been a terrible thing for
[1:37:43] him to make the wrong choice. Amen.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:50] Amen.
[1:37:53] What did brother Brandham say
[1:37:57] about when he went beyond the curtain of
[1:37:59] time and also to the regions of the
[1:38:02] lost? He said he was in the regions of
[1:38:04] the lost also.
[1:38:06] And he said he was so terrible. HE
[1:38:08] YELLED, "MOM,
[1:38:09] NO MOM. DAD, NO DAD. GOD, [screaming]
[1:38:15] NO GOD.
[1:38:17] Nothing there. No God there." And he
[1:38:21] said, "God, if you'll bring me back, I
[1:38:23] promise I'll be a good boy. I'll do
[1:38:25] right."
[1:38:27] Isn't that right? And God brought him
[1:38:29] back out of there. He was dying of that
[1:38:30] gunshot, I believe it was. And he they
[1:38:33] were just he was really almost almost
[1:38:35] dead.
[1:38:37] But he says he come back and he says
[1:38:39] whatever you do don't go down that
[1:38:43] downward road.
[1:38:45] Young people don't ever go down that
[1:38:49] downward road. Don't take the wrong
[1:38:52] road. Don't make the wrong choice.
[1:38:56] Amen. Make the right choice. The
[1:39:00] greatest choice you're going to make is
[1:39:01] to serve Jesus. How many believe say,
[1:39:03] "God, I choose you." Without God,
[1:39:07] without the Holy Spirit, there's no way
[1:39:10] that I can make it. There's no way that
[1:39:12] you can make it. You'll end up wrecked
[1:39:15] up somewhere.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; How do you start down the right word?
[1:39:21] Well, I don't have to listen to what mom
[1:39:23] and daddy says. I don't have to listen
[1:39:24] to what the preacher says. I want to
[1:39:26] quit going to church. Uh-oh. There is
[1:39:28] down the wrong road.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Down that wrong road. It won't be long
[1:39:34] till there's no telling where you'll be
[1:39:36] in the misery that you'll be in. Amen.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Don't go down the wrong road.
[1:39:44] Amen.
[1:39:46] All right.
[1:39:48] Couple more things. 15 after already.
[1:39:51] That was quick, wasn't it? Amen. Time
[1:39:53] goes fast when you haven't t haven't
[1:39:55] time. Brother Bandam is explaining
[1:39:57] something now.
[1:40:00] I want to talk about the cars that we
[1:40:02] have for a minute. Okay.
[1:40:05] And I want to talk about back in my day
[1:40:08] there was many of them that were manual.
[1:40:10] Ain't that right, brother Bannon one
[1:40:12] time in explaining
[1:40:15] when you get over there and they say
[1:40:18] he'll say to the goats, he says, you
[1:40:19] know, when I was hungry, you didn't feed
[1:40:21] me. When I was naked, you didn't clothe
[1:40:23] me. When I was in prison, you never
[1:40:24] visited me. Isn't that right? And then
[1:40:27] he said, "On the other eye, to the
[1:40:28] sheep." He says, "WHEN I WAS HUNGRY, YOU
[1:40:30] FED ME. WHEN I WAS CLO when I need
[1:40:32] clothes, you clothed me." And so forth.
[1:40:33] WHEN I WAS IN PRISON, YOU VISITED ME.
[1:40:35] And they said,
[1:40:37] THEY SAID, "WHEN DID WE DO ALL THOSE
[1:40:40] THINGS?" I didn't bring the quote out,
[1:40:42] but says, HE SAYS, "WHAT IT WAS, WHAT IT
[1:40:45] IS IS IT WAS SO AUTOMATIC IN THEIR
[1:40:47] HEARTS."
[1:40:49] AND HE SAYS, "THAT'S HOW YOU WANT IT TO
[1:40:52] BE." AMEN. The Christian life that YOU
[1:40:54] LIVE NEEDS TO BE AUTOMATIC.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Just something that comes from you,
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; you know. And I was thinking about a
[1:41:05] Wednesday night. Sometimes it's hard to
[1:41:07] GET OUT, BUT WE COME TO CHURCH ON
[1:41:09] WEDNESDAY NIGHT because we believe in
[1:41:10] having church on Wednesday.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE ON HAVING CHURCH ON SUNDAY.
[1:41:15] IF WE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN ON COME HAVING
[1:41:17] CHURCH ON WEDNESDAY, WE wouldn't come.
[1:41:20] THERE'S CHURCHES THAT ONLY DO HAVE IT
[1:41:22] ONCE A WEEK.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WHY? WE LOVE IT. WE WANT MORE
[1:41:27] OF IT.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE WHAT IS IT?
[1:41:31] BOUGHT BY God and
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; enjoying every minute of it. Something
[1:41:36] like that.
[1:41:39] Amen. [laughter]
[1:41:41] ISN'T THAT RIGHT? HOW MANY HOW MANY
[1:41:42] ENJOY COMING TO CHURCH?
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; WHY? AMEN. THERE'S THOSE THAT ARE KIND
[1:41:47] OF MANUAL. MAYBE THERE'S PEOPLE HAVE TO
[1:41:49] JUST REALLY STRUGGLE. BOY, I DON'T KNOW.
[1:41:51] I don't I don't really want to go to
[1:41:53] church, BUT I BETTER SOMEBODY'S going to
[1:41:54] wonder where I am.
[1:41:57] Don't have a manual transmission. Have
[1:41:59] an automatic transmission.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; AUTOMATICALLY. OH, PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[1:42:04] WE'RE GOING TO GET TOGETHER TONIGHT.
[1:42:05] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME TONIGHT.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; We're going to HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:42:09] EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BRING THEIR AMENS
[1:42:11] and their hallelujah.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; GLORY. BROTHER BAM SAYS, YOU KNOW, MY
[1:42:17] YOU GET A REAL CHRISTIAN THAT'S NOT IN A
[1:42:19] JUSTIFIED STATE. AMEN. NOT IN A MANUAL
[1:42:21] STATE, BUT AMEN. IT'S JUST SO AUTOMATIC.
[1:42:24] THEY'RE IN THE PRESENCE of God. Amen.
[1:42:26] Whether they HAVEN'T HAD A REVIVAL FOR
[1:42:28] SIX MONTHS, THEY'RE STILL IN A REVIVAL.
[1:42:31] I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I WANT TO
[1:42:32] LIVE IN THAT CHAKANA GLORY INTO THE
[1:42:34] HOLIES of holies. NOT BEING OUT THERE
[1:42:37] WHERE THE CANDLE GOES OUT. I don't want
[1:42:40] my GAS TO RUN OUT. I DON'T WANT TO GET
[1:42:42] MY FILM. I want to be automatic.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; I want IT TO JUST FLOW OUT.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOMETIME BETTER B SAYS, YOU KNOW,
[1:42:53] MY DENOMINATIONAL SYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
[1:42:55] THAT AIN'T that are JUST IN A JUSTIFIED
[1:42:58] STATE. AMEN. THERE'S NOT REALLY COME ALL
[1:43:00] THE way in yet.
[1:43:02] THEY GOT TO COME TO CHURCH AND THEY GOT
[1:43:04] TO PRAY AND THEY GOT TO GET PUMPED UP.
[1:43:06] And maybe if the preacher gets excited,
[1:43:08] they'll get a little excited.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll TELL YOU WHAT, YOU KNOW,
[1:43:13] WHEN YOU HAVE AN OLD WELL LIKE I USED TO
[1:43:16] AT HOME ON AN AMISH FARM AND WE'D HAVE
[1:43:19] TO GO OUT there and we'd have to get a
[1:43:20] bucket of water AND WE'D HAVE TO POUR IT
[1:43:22] IN OVER TOP OF THAT LITTLE PUMP. AMEN.
[1:43:24] Down the hole to prime it and then we'd
[1:43:26] have TO PUMP REAL FAST AND GET THAT
[1:43:28] THING PRIMED.
[1:43:32] And finally THAT WATER COME SHOOTING UP
[1:43:34] OUT OF THERE. HE SAYS THAT'S THE WAY
[1:43:36] SOME CHRISTIAN IS, MAN. YOU GOT TO GIVE
[1:43:38] HIM ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR OF PRIMING
[1:43:40] BEFORE YOU'LL EVER GET AN AMEN out of
[1:43:42] him
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; or hallelujah.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we DON'T WANT TO BE THAT WAY.
[1:43:49] HOW MANY I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT WAY. I
[1:43:51] WANT THAT ARTISIAN WELL SPRINGING UP.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO LIVE.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:59] ANOTHER EXAMPLE MAYBE QUICKLY GIVE YOU.
[1:44:02] AMEN. THE CARS THAT WE HAVE. AMEN. HOW
[1:44:04] MANY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I I'M
[1:44:06] GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO get in there. It
[1:44:07] might be nice. You know, if you have a
[1:44:09] sports car, you know, you got this hot
[1:44:11] rod or whatever. MAYBE SOME OF THOSE
[1:44:13] FOLKS, they like to, YOU KNOW, THEY LIKE
[1:44:15] TO PUT THAT CLUTCH IN AND PUT PULL IT UP
[1:44:17] INTO SECOND AND YOU GOT TO PUSH this and
[1:44:20] you got to push this and you SHIFT IT
[1:44:22] AROUND. THERE WE GO.
[1:44:28] Brother Glenn, Sister Shay, isn't it
[1:44:30] nice to just pull it down
[1:44:33] into D and push the G on the G. Put it
[1:44:38] in D and press the G. Press the gas and
[1:44:42] off YOU GO. IT SHIFTS FOR ITSELF.
[1:44:45] You know, even that Dodge truck better,
[1:44:48] it's got a place where I could do that
[1:44:49] if I want to. Just shift it, you know,
[1:44:51] push it over in first gear. And I that
[1:44:53] means you can go a little rev it out a
[1:44:55] little higher. You can come up to A STOP
[1:44:57] SIGN.
[1:45:04] YEAH, IT'S GOT THAT OPTION. But a
[1:45:06] Christian likes it in automatic.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? An automatic.
[1:45:13] And you know, I WANT TO TELL YOU
[1:45:14] SOMETHING IN CLOSING.
[1:45:16] And that IS THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE.
[1:45:19] WE'VE GOT SOMETHING BESIDE THE
[1:45:21] AUTOMATIC.
[1:45:29] something beyond something further.
[1:45:32] Brother Joe probably he's got the newest
[1:45:34] truck probably of anybody.
[1:45:37] Amen. AND CAN YOU PUT IT ON AUTOPILOT?
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; YEAH. It won't run a ditch.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; It won't run a ditch. You can take your
[1:45:45] hand off your gas. Can you take your
[1:45:47] hand off your brakes? Can you take your
[1:45:49] HAND OFF THE STEERING WHEEL?
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; WOW. SO [screaming] ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS
[1:45:55] PUSH A BUTTON AND IT'S ON AUTOPILOT.
[1:45:59] IT WON'T WRECK IN THE OTHER GUY. WON'T
[1:46:01] WRECK IN THE DITCH. HOW MANY BELIEVE
[1:46:03] THAT'S THE WAY YOU AND I WANT TO BE
[1:46:05] GOING DOWN THIS ROAD? AMEN. LET'S JUST
[1:46:07] LET HIM BE THE PILOT. [applause]
[1:46:10] LET HIM BE THE PILOT. OH NO. NO. A LOT
[1:46:13] OF US OLDER FOLKS SAY, "I DON'T TRUST
[1:46:15] IT. MY WIFE SAYS THAT. I WOULDN'T WANT
[1:46:18] THAT AUTOPILOT. LET ME HAVE THAT
[1:46:20] STEERING WHEEL. YOU GIVE ME THEM BREAKS
[1:46:22] AND YOU LET ME HAVE THAT GAS. THAT'S THE
[1:46:26] WAY WE ARE IN THE CHRISTIAN WALK. HELLO.
[1:46:28] I LIKE BEING ABLE TO HAVE CONTROL OF
[1:46:29] THINGS. BUT HOW MANY BELIEVES THIS
[1:46:32] PILOT? AMEN. CHRIST IS OUR PILOT. HE
[1:46:35] WON'T WRECK YOU. JUST LET GO OF THE WILL
[1:46:37] AND ENJOY THE RIDE. [screaming]
[1:46:40] ENJOY BEING A CHRISTIAN. ENJOY GOING TO
[1:46:42] CHURCH. ENJOY [screaming] THE THINGS OF
[1:46:45] GOD. AUTOPILOT. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; DON'T MAKE HIM YOUR CO-PILOT. THAT'S HOW
[1:46:51] WE LIVE SOMETIMES. WE WANT TO GO DOWN
[1:46:53] the road and say, "Oh, Jesus, you just
[1:46:56] sit there and hang on now. I'm driving
[1:46:58] this thing. I'm glad that you're with
[1:47:01] me."
[1:47:02] You know,
[1:47:05] BUT WE'VE GOT HIM IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.
[1:47:08] WE DON'T WANT HIM IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.
[1:47:10] HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE DRIVER'S
[1:47:12] SEAT. HOW MANY BELIEVES HE IS MY PILOT?
[1:47:14] HE'S NOT MY CO-PILOT. HE'S MY PILOT.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; HE'S MY AUTOPILOT. [screaming]
[1:47:21] AMEN. AND LET HIM TAKE YOU HOME. LET HIM
[1:47:24] TAKE US HOME. HE KNOWS THE WAY. WE
[1:47:27] DON'T, BUT HE DOES. [applause]
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:32] I'm glad.
[1:47:34] [sighs and gasps]
[1:47:37] [snorts] Amen. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Greater than automatic. We've got a
[1:47:43] autopilot.
[1:47:45] Sit back and enjoy the ride. One place,
[1:47:48] Brother Bam says, "Me and we are sealed.
[1:47:50] We've got the great leader leading us
[1:47:53] and guiding us. We're just enjoying a
[1:47:56] going along."
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's not always easy. No. But if
[1:48:00] you'll commit it to him,
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; he'll take you through.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY SO THANKFUL THAT OH MY, YOU'VE
[1:48:07] HAD SO MANY STORMS. I MEAN, SO MANY
[1:48:09] DIFFERENT PLACES THAT YOU COME UP TO. IF
[1:48:11] YOU'D HAVE JUST GIVEN IT TO HIM, IT'D
[1:48:13] HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER OFF. YOU'D HAVE
[1:48:14] LESS GRAY HAIR.
[1:48:18] AMEN.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; You want to be young, YOU WANT TO LOOK
[1:48:22] YOUNG, QUIT WORRYING. BE LIKE THAT LADY
[1:48:24] THAT BROTHER BRANDON MET IN THE STORE.
[1:48:26] MAN, SHE WAS 60 LOOKING 30. WHAT DID YOU
[1:48:28] DO? I'M TELLING YOU WHAT, IF GOD CAN'T
[1:48:30] HANDLE IT, AIN'T NO SENSE IN ME WORRYING
[1:48:32] ABOUT IT.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S HOW WE WANT TO
[1:48:35] BE?
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:41] Like that man that went uh Brother Bam
[1:48:44] tells a story. I won't I won't read it,
[1:48:46] but I'm trying to hurry. But he was
[1:48:51] poor. THIS MAN WAS POOR. HE WAS A
[1:48:54] PALPER. AND HE COME UP TO THIS FLOWER,
[1:48:55] PICKED THIS FLOWER, AND THIS FLOWER
[1:48:56] SAID, "YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN POOR, HAVEN'T
[1:48:58] YOU?" "YES, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN POOR."
[1:49:00] "WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT?" "You know, IF
[1:49:03] YOU CAN ASK WHATEVER YOU WANT AS LONG AS
[1:49:04] YOU CARRY ME WITH YOU." AND HE SAYS, "I
[1:49:06] WISH THAT MOUNTAIN OVER THERE WOULD OPEN
[1:49:08] UP AND I COULD GET SOME GOLD AND SOME
[1:49:10] DIAMONDS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS." HE
[1:49:12] SAID, "AS YOU WISH." WOO! THERE GOES THE
[1:49:15] MOUNTAIN. HE GOES WALKING IN AND HE
[1:49:18] GRABS CHUNKS OF GOLD, GETS HIS BAG AND
[1:49:20] LOADS UP AND GETS AS MUCH AS HE CAN. HE
[1:49:23] SAYS, "MAN, I'M GOING TO GO UP THERE.
[1:49:24] I'M GOING TO GO BACK HOME AND I'M GOING
[1:49:26] TO SHOW HIM. SHOW HOW MUCH RICH
[1:49:28] [screaming] I AM. I'M GOING TO ENJOY
[1:49:29] IT." BUT HE SAID, "WHATEVER YOU DO,
[1:49:31] THAT'S FLOWER." SAID, "YOU GOT TO TAKE
[1:49:33] ME WITH YOU." BUT HE LAID IT ON THE
[1:49:35] SHELF. HE HAD TOO MUCH OF HIS STUFF AND
[1:49:37] HE WAS ENJOYING THE BLESSINGS OF GOD.
[1:49:39] BUT HE FORGOT THE FLOWER AND LEFT THE
[1:49:41] FLOWER THERE. AMEN. WENT OUT THERE AND I
[1:49:43] THINK SHUT UP. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? CLOSED
[1:49:47] UP. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WITH CHRISTIANS
[1:49:50] A LOT OF TIMES. [screaming] WE ENJOY THE
[1:49:51] PRESENCE OF GOD. WE ENJOY THE HOLY
[1:49:53] GHOST. DON'T YOU FORGET TO TAKE HIM
[1:49:55] ALONG.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO, TAKE HIM WITH
[1:49:58] YOU.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; On this road, don't never leave him
[1:50:04] behind. You'll find yourself way out
[1:50:08] there somewhere.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:11] Praise the Lord. God bless you. Amen.
[1:50:16] As you go along, Brother Abraham tells
[1:50:18] the story of the prospector.
[1:50:20] Amen. Found gold out there prospecting.
[1:50:24] Filled his bag up and he was on his way
[1:50:27] home. Amen. How many believes that you
[1:50:29] FOUND GOLD?
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; WE FOUND [laughter] DEITY. WE FOUND
[1:50:32] GOLD. AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY HOME. AMEN.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WHEN HE GOT TO HIS CAB AND HE
[1:50:38] WENT TO TRY TO GO TO SLEEP, THAT DOG
[1:50:40] BARKED AND BARKED AND BARKED AND BARKED.
[1:50:42] SHUT UP, FRITZ. SHUT UP, FRITZ, SO TO
[1:50:44] SPEAK. WE'LL CALL HIM FRITZ TONIGHT.
[1:50:46] CAUGHT UP, DOG. SHUT UP. AND HE WOULDN'T
[1:50:48] QUIT BARKING. HE FINALLY GOT UP AND SHOT
[1:50:50] THE DOG.
[1:50:53] HELLO. And later that night, somebody
[1:50:56] knew he had that.
[1:50:59] Somebody knew he had that and he went
[1:51:01] and killed him. But Abraham says, "The
[1:51:03] way that they know that he did it was
[1:51:05] the guy that shot him before dying
[1:51:08] confessed it."
[1:51:10] That's right. That's how you know the
[1:51:12] story anyway. And so, but what did he
[1:51:16] do? He hushed that voice. How many
[1:51:18] believes you need to listen to that
[1:51:19] navigator when it warns you of something
[1:51:22] dangerous near?
[1:51:24] AMEN. THAT PHONE DANGER IS NEAR. OVER
[1:51:27] HERE'S A TRAP. SO THE DEVIL LIKE A
[1:51:29] ROARING LION IS TRYING TO GET THE YOU TO
[1:51:32] AMEN. GO INTO THE ditch
[1:51:35] trying to rob you of your gold
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; to keep you from getting home.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:42] So let's listen to that still small
[1:51:43] voice. Don't never hush it. Young
[1:51:46] people, listen to that still small
[1:51:48] voice. Elena, listen to that still small
[1:51:51] voice. All of you listen to that still
[1:51:54] small voice. It'll lead you right.
[1:51:58] How many's glad for that still small
[1:52:00] voice?
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; It was meant to lead us, to guide us.
[1:52:04] Stand with me,
[1:52:06] musicians, if you'll come.
[1:52:11] That's right.
[1:52:15] I truly believe that we're living in the
[1:52:18] hour
[1:52:20] when as brother Bannam as he was in
[1:52:23] Memphis and his plane was downed and he
[1:52:26] would go down a street and he would say,
[1:52:28] "Take a right turn. Take a left turn."
[1:52:30] Ain't that right? Oh, my plane's going
[1:52:33] to lose. I'm going to miss my plane.
[1:52:35] Fear tried to grip him. Don't let fear
[1:52:37] grip him. Just listen to that voice.
[1:52:39] We're living in the hour of the GPS of
[1:52:41] the Holy Spirit that tells you don't do
[1:52:44] this, don't do that. How many wants to
[1:52:47] hear that voice in a greater way than
[1:52:48] what you are? God help us. Let's bow our
[1:52:51] heads. Lord Jesus, we bow our heads to
[1:52:53] you now, Lord.
[1:52:55] Thanking you, Father, for your presence.
[1:52:58] Thanking you for the Holy Spirit that
[1:53:01] leads us, that guides us,
[1:53:04] Father, that even though you've given
[1:53:06] pastors to pastor people and and
[1:53:09] teachers to teach and and all these
[1:53:11] things, Lord, but the greatest and the
[1:53:13] main leader that you have given us, the
[1:53:15] main guide that you have given us is the
[1:53:17] Holy Spirit in each one of our lives,
[1:53:20] Lord Jesus. And we want to ask God
[1:53:21] tonight that you would help each one,
[1:53:23] Father, especially those of us, God, who
[1:53:25] have in the past know that we've taken
[1:53:28] wrong turns and it was bad.
[1:53:32] Lord Jesus, you've taught us not to.
[1:53:33] You've taught us to be more careful
[1:53:35] about the turns that we make, the
[1:53:37] choices that we make. Make sure it's not
[1:53:40] in your flesh. Make sure it's in the
[1:53:42] spirit. Make sure it's what God wants
[1:53:44] you to do. I ask God that you'd lead and
[1:53:47] guide everybody here at Evening Light
[1:53:49] Tabernacle. Lord, those that are
[1:53:51] streaming, ask God that you'd bless
[1:53:53] them. Father, we're glad that they
[1:53:55] listen. We pray God that you'll lead
[1:53:56] them, guide them, Lord Jesus, into the
[1:53:59] truth. For we know that you said that
[1:54:01] the comforter would lead us into all
[1:54:03] truth. We ask God that you would lead
[1:54:06] each one now, [music] Father, as we go
[1:54:08] through these perilous times, Lord
[1:54:10] Jesus, of robbers everywhere, devil
[1:54:12] everywhere, roaring lion, trying to take
[1:54:15] our joy from us, trying to take our
[1:54:17] peace from us, trying to get our eyes on
[1:54:19] the things of the world instead of the
[1:54:21] things of God. Amen. And to give us a
[1:54:24] greater passion for the things of the
[1:54:25] world than the things of God. Forgive
[1:54:27] us, Lord. We ask, God, that you would
[1:54:29] now, Lord, take and look beneath every
[1:54:31] hand, Lord, tonight. And Lord, I pray
[1:54:34] God that you're the navigator navigator
[1:54:36] of the Holy Spirit. [music] As Paul
[1:54:39] said, those that are led by the spirit
[1:54:40] of God, they are the sons of God. That's
[1:54:43] what we want to be is led by you,
[1:54:45] Father. [music]
[1:54:46] We ask it in Jesus name.
[1:54:49] Amen. And amen.
[1:54:52] Amen. And amen. God bless you, Brother
[1:54:55] David.
[1:54:57] Y'all help me sing it. God will make
[1:55:01] [singing and music] a way
[1:55:03] when there seems to be no way. [music]
[1:55:09] He makes a way.
[1:55:14] He will [singing and music] make a way
[1:55:17] for me.
[1:55:18] He will be my [singing and music] guide.
[1:55:23] Hold me closely to his side.
[1:55:28] love and caring for each new
[1:55:31] [music and singing] day. He will make a
[1:55:35] way.
