[50:25] Brother Michael John and brother John
[50:27] Wade and brother Caleb, would you come
[50:29] take up the
[50:33] offering? Uh, Brother
[50:35] Austin, I guess he got the stomach bug
[50:38] from the girls, so he's not feeling well
[50:41] tonight. So, we brother Austin and
[50:43] little Haven and SA and just pray for
[50:46] Sister Serenity that she don't get sick
[50:48] and just pray that God will be with him.
[50:50] And also uh continue member Sister
[50:53] Parish as she's in the hospital and
[50:55] that's all the requests that we have
[50:57] tonight. Continue member Janet, she's at
[50:59] home and she watched the service this
[51:01] morning. She thoroughly enjoyed it. And
[51:04] and but she tells me, she said, you
[51:05] know, it's nice to be able to stream,
[51:08] but it just not like being there. But
[51:11] you know what? If you can't do nothing
[51:12] but stream, that's the best thing to do
[51:15] because it sure beats missing church
[51:16] altogether. I'll tell you. You know,
[51:19] there there's a lot of people they won't
[51:20] miss and they'll spend thousands of
[51:22] dollars to go to a ball game and I mean
[51:25] literally thousands of
[51:27] dollars and then their team loses and
[51:30] they're they're just heartbroken,
[51:32] especially mine. They're not doing too
[51:34] good this year, but that's part of life.
[51:36] But you know what? We serve an awesome
[51:37] God tonight. We don't lose. I read the
[51:40] back of the book, Brother Tommy, and we
[51:42] win. Amen. So, if you have need on your
[51:45] hearts, you might let it be known by the
[51:46] uplifted hand. And we're going to ask
[51:47] brother John Wade if he'd pray over the
[51:49] offering tonight and these requests.
[52:50] Let's sing a little horse. And I just
[52:52] want to thank you, Lord. Come ahead,
[52:54] Sister Lisa. And I just want to thank
[52:58] you,
[53:00] Lord, for letting me hear your word.
[53:07] What have I done to deserve such glory
[53:13] revealed in
[53:15] [Music]
[53:17] me? Thanks for that special
[53:22] night when I saw this glorious
[53:28] light. Came face to face with
[53:32] eternal life. And Lord, I thank
[53:38] [Music]
[53:50] you. See if that's on.
[54:04] So, I wasn't going to sing this song um
[54:06] but last night my um Jana actually
[54:09] mentioned it and so I thought it
[54:12] actually went pretty well with this
[54:13] morning. So, I went ahead and and I'm
[54:16] going to sing it.
[54:19] [Music]
[54:41] A man was lame so long. He thought all
[54:44] hope was gone. He needed someone strong
[54:48] to get him through the throng. His
[54:51] friends, they raised the roof. They had
[54:54] to get through somehow.

[57:30] appreciate them, the girls being with
[57:32] us. And Sister Zoe, God bless you. And
[57:49] You can take care of it.
[57:57] [Music]
[58:11] I came to
[58:14] you with my heart in
[58:17] [Music]
[58:19] pieces and found the
[58:22] God with healing in his hands.
[58:28] I turned to
[58:30] you, put
[58:33] everything behind
[58:36] me, and found my
[58:39] God who makes all things new.
[58:45] And I looked to
[58:48] you drowning in my
[58:53] question and found the God who holds all
[58:59] the
[59:01] wisdom. And I trusted you and stepped
[59:06] out on the ocean.
[59:11] You caught my head among the
[59:14] waves. Cuz you're the God of all my
[59:22] days. Each step I
[59:26] take. You
[59:28] make
[59:31] way. And I will give you all my praise.
[59:39] my
[59:40] season
[59:42] change. You stay the
[59:47] same. Cuz you're the God of all my
[59:54] days. I ran from you.
[59:58] I wondered in the
[1:00:02] shadows and found a
[1:00:05] god who rinlessly
[1:00:10] pursues. I hid from
[1:00:14] you, haunted by my
[1:00:18] failure, and found the
[1:00:21] God whose grace still covers me.
[1:00:27] I fell on you when I was at my
[1:00:34] weakest and found the
[1:00:37] God, the lifter of my
[1:00:42] head. I've
[1:00:44] worshiped you and felt you right beside
[1:00:50] me. You're the reason why I sing. Cuz
[1:00:55] you're the God of all my
[1:01:01] days. Each

[1:01:10] away and I will give you all my
[1:01:17] praise. My
[1:01:19] sins are changed.

[1:01:25] same. You're the God of all my
[1:01:33] days. In my
[1:01:36] worry, God, you are my stillness.
[1:01:42] In my
[1:01:44] searching, God, you are my
[1:01:49] vision. In my
[1:01:52] blindness, God, you are my
[1:01:57] vision. And in my
[1:02:01] bondage, God, you are my freom.
[1:02:07] in my
[1:02:09] weakness. God, you are my
[1:02:14] power and you're the reason that I sing.
[1:02:18] Cuz you're the God of all my
[1:02:25] days. You step by
[1:02:29] day, you make the
[1:02:33] way. And I will give you all my
[1:02:40] praise. My
[1:02:43] se
[1:02:44] change. You stay the
[1:02:49] same. You're the God of all my days.
[1:02:58] In my
[1:03:00] blindness, God, you are my
[1:03:05] vision. In my
[1:03:08] bondage, God, you are my
[1:03:13] freom. Cuz you're the God of all my
[1:03:18] days.
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:22] [Applause]
[1:03:31] Amen. Let's stand if we could. We're
[1:03:33] just going to change the order of
[1:03:34] service and sure appreciate those
[1:03:37] specials tonight and just being in tune
[1:03:39] with the Lord and the movement of the
[1:03:40] spirit. So, but at this time, we just
[1:03:42] want to give the Lord his time, most
[1:03:45] important mo most important time of the
[1:03:47] service. And brother Joe's got a long
[1:03:49] drive ahead of him tonight and and uh
[1:03:51] about 10 hours. And so we want to give
[1:03:54] him all the time that he needs. Okay,
[1:03:56] we're not here to rush God. So, but
[1:03:59] let's just say sing Amazing Grace as
[1:04:01] brother Joe
[1:04:02] comes.
[1:04:06] Amazing
[1:04:08] grace, how
[1:04:11] sweet the
[1:04:13] sound that
[1:04:16] saved a
[1:04:19] rich like me.
[1:04:25] I
[1:04:27] once was
[1:04:30] lost, but
[1:04:33] now I'm
[1:04:35] found. Was
[1:04:38] blind, but
[1:04:41] now I see.
[1:04:45] [Applause]
[1:04:47] Was
[1:04:49] grace that
[1:04:52] taught my
[1:04:55] heart to
[1:04:57] fear and
[1:05:02] grace. Thank you.
[1:05:08] Oh, how
[1:05:12] precious
[1:05:14] did that
[1:05:17] grace
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:19] appear? The
[1:05:22] hour I
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:28] mer. Amen. Let's just go to him in
[1:05:30] prayer. Father, we believe tonight we
[1:05:33] thank you for your presence this
[1:05:34] morning, Lord. We know that's not the
[1:05:36] work of a man. But Lord, we know that
[1:05:38] your spirit come and you begin to stir
[1:05:41] hearts and stir lives, Lord, and begin
[1:05:43] to bring the revelation of the promise
[1:05:46] that you've given us in your word, Lord.
[1:05:49] And it stimulates us, Father, to faith,
[1:05:51] to believe, to
[1:05:53] overcome, Lord. One by one, each begin
[1:05:56] to get out of their seat and walk around
[1:05:57] making a declaration of faith. God, only
[1:06:00] you can do that. And Lord, we're not
[1:06:03] under an expectation you're going to do
[1:06:05] the same thing tonight. But we are in a
[1:06:06] great expectation that you're going to
[1:06:08] do what you desire to do what you
[1:06:10] pre-planned before the foundation. And I
[1:06:13] just want to do my part, Lord, as a
[1:06:14] minister of the gospel to step aside for
[1:06:17] this next little bit, Lord. Allow you to
[1:06:18] speak to your people, Lord. Speak to
[1:06:21] hearts, speak to lies. Again, we thank
[1:06:24] you for the ministry here, the
[1:06:25] confidence they have in us, Lord, to
[1:06:28] invite us to come and speak to the
[1:06:30] purchase of the blood.
[1:06:31] Lord, we just want you to have your way
[1:06:33] now. We ask in Jesus' name.
[1:06:36] Amen. If you have your Bibles again this
[1:06:39] evening, we're going to we're going to
[1:06:40] pick up here in
[1:06:42] Matthew. I'm going to pick up where I
[1:06:44] didn't finish this morning because I
[1:06:46] only preached about 10 pages of my
[1:06:48] notes. So, uh I have 60 pages, but I'm
[1:06:51] not going to finish off all all of it
[1:06:54] tonight. I know some of us we done went
[1:06:56] home. Everybody done got scattered out.
[1:06:58] But I want to speak some things tonight.
[1:07:01] Maybe that will just kind of coincide
[1:07:02] with this morning how the service
[1:07:04] changed and uh for those who are at
[1:07:07] home, they may stream it later just to
[1:07:09] kind of anchor what we preach this
[1:07:11] morning and solidify and may it just
[1:07:13] take root. So we're going to look here
[1:07:15] in Matthew 17 and verse 20 and we're
[1:07:18] speaking again
[1:07:19] on power restored to the
[1:07:23] church. Power restored to the church.
[1:07:26] That's going to be a theme because the
[1:07:27] thing about it is you must realize that
[1:07:29] you are the church
[1:07:31] and that you're not a powerless group of
[1:07:34] people, but you're a church that God has
[1:07:37] deposited his power into, his life into,
[1:07:40] we look here in in Matthew 17. And for
[1:07:43] those that made a step this morning, let
[1:07:45] me just say this. This is going to be
[1:07:46] for you tonight. Uh Matthew 17 and verse
[1:07:49] 20. And Jesus said unto them, "Because
[1:07:52] of your unbelief, verily I say unto you,
[1:07:54] if you have
[1:07:55] faith, remember we hinted on faith this
[1:07:58] this morning. But if you have faith as a
[1:08:00] grain of a mustard seed, you shall say
[1:08:03] unto this
[1:08:05] mountain, remove hence to yonder place,
[1:08:07] and it shall remove, and nothing shall
[1:08:10] be impossible unto you."
[1:08:13] In Luke 13 and verse 19, it is like a
[1:08:16] grain of mustard seed which a man took
[1:08:18] and he cast into a garden and it grew
[1:08:21] and it waxed a great tree and the fowls
[1:08:24] of the air lodged in the branches of it.
[1:08:27] So God bless you. You can have your
[1:08:28] seats this morning or this
[1:08:30] evening. I would ask that you would keep
[1:08:32] us in prayer as we travel home this
[1:08:34] evening. We have about nine and a half
[1:08:37] to 10 hours to go and the girls have to
[1:08:40] be at work tomorrow.
[1:08:42] That's odd to say. They're teenagers,
[1:08:43] right? They got to be at work. But we're
[1:08:46] going to get home, Lord willing, this
[1:08:47] evening in one piece. But I want to
[1:08:50] speak to you and I just kind of want to
[1:08:52] take my time this evening. Usually I'll
[1:08:53] take a second service and slow down big
[1:08:56] time because you know the morning
[1:08:57] service I kind of put everything into a
[1:08:59] morning service. But hey, we don't know
[1:09:00] how the Lord's going to lead. But just
[1:09:02] want to look at this. If you have faith
[1:09:04] as a grain of a mustard seed and you
[1:09:06] know sometimes you talk to people
[1:09:08] brother Brad and brother Thomas as a
[1:09:10] minister you talk to people and you know
[1:09:12] their first maybe their first reaction
[1:09:14] or their first confession is I don't
[1:09:16] have faith or I don't have great big
[1:09:17] faith and you know and but the Bible
[1:09:20] tells us that God has given every man
[1:09:23] now that doesn't mean just man alone and
[1:09:26] not
[1:09:27] women but every man or or human species
[1:09:31] we'll call it like a measure of faith.
[1:09:35] So God has done this. So to say that you
[1:09:38] don't have faith means you're denying
[1:09:40] what God has already done. But God has
[1:09:42] given you faith. And we find this is
[1:09:45] Jesus speaking here to his disciples.
[1:09:48] And he says, "If you have faith as a
[1:09:50] grain of a mustard seed, the
[1:09:53] smallest seed that there
[1:09:55] is." And brother Brandham makes a
[1:09:58] statement about mustard seed. It's a
[1:10:00] seed. is a that can't be mixed with
[1:10:02] anything else. Mustard is mustard. It
[1:10:05] won't be mixed with unbelief. It won't
[1:10:07] be mixed with fear. It won't be mixed
[1:10:09] with
[1:10:10] denominationalism. It will not be mixed.
[1:10:13] It is mustard seed. It cannot hybridize.
[1:10:16] It cannot mix. And he says if you have
[1:10:19] faith, just a little bit of faith as
[1:10:22] small as a grain of a mustard seed, you
[1:10:25] can speak to your mountain. Amen.
[1:10:30] You can speak to your mountain.
[1:10:33] Whatever that thing is in your life.
[1:10:35] Remember, we're speaking on power now.
[1:10:37] Don't lose the theme of the service.
[1:10:40] Power restored to the church. And you
[1:10:42] think, "Well, I don't have much." You
[1:10:44] have a mustard seed amount of faith. You
[1:10:47] have enough faith in you right there to
[1:10:50] move a mountain.
[1:10:52] The prophet of God said, "We have enough
[1:10:54] faith or enough power within us now that
[1:10:56] we can create another world." and go
[1:10:58] live on it.
[1:11:00] Look, I don't need another world to go
[1:11:02] live on. I need to conquer this one. I
[1:11:05] need to conquer this world right here,
[1:11:07] this flesh right here. And I want you to
[1:11:09] know, many of you, you may say, "Well,
[1:11:11] my position or my situation, my trial,
[1:11:14] the thing I'm going through, it's so
[1:11:15] different. Nobody's been there before."
[1:11:17] But if you got the smallest amount of
[1:11:21] faith, no matter where you've been, no
[1:11:23] matter what you're going through, I want
[1:11:26] you to know tonight, you can speak to
[1:11:27] that mountain that lays before you and
[1:11:30] say, "Remove, hinder place." And it has
[1:11:32] to move.
[1:11:34] There's no question. Will it move? It
[1:11:36] has to move because this is red letter
[1:11:39] in the King James Bible. And you can
[1:11:41] tell it to remove yonder place. and
[1:11:45] nothing shall be impossible unto you.
[1:11:50] So God does not require a whole lot out
[1:11:53] of you.
[1:11:56] You know, think about it. We think,
[1:11:57] well, if I can just have faith like
[1:11:59] brother Joe, he's got bulldog
[1:12:01] faith. But God's not asking you to have
[1:12:04] that type of faith.
[1:12:07] Come on, church.
[1:12:09] He just wants you to have just a little
[1:12:10] bit. says, "With that smallest amount,
[1:12:13] God can do wonders."
[1:12:17] God can do amazing things with that
[1:12:20] amount of faith. And I like what he
[1:12:22] says, and I'm just like I said, I'm
[1:12:23] going to slow it down and maybe not
[1:12:25] teach, but kind of preach teach here,
[1:12:26] but he said, "If a farmer went and
[1:12:28] planted a great big big wheat, and every
[1:12:30] morning he got out there and dug all the
[1:12:32] wheat up to see if it was going to
[1:12:34] sprout or not, as long as you keep
[1:12:36] digging up the seed, it will never
[1:12:38] grow." That's right.
[1:12:40] You know, a lot of times on our
[1:12:42] humanity, that's what we do.
[1:12:45] All right, it's just us girls here this
[1:12:47] evening. That's what we do. We pray, we
[1:12:50] believe. The next morning, we dig it up
[1:12:52] and say, "Okay, did it happen?"
[1:12:55] Come on.
[1:12:57] Dig it up. Oh, you know I, you know, you
[1:12:59] expect it immediately. You just expect a
[1:13:01] harvest. Look, when you plant seed in
[1:13:03] the ground, y'all live around here. I
[1:13:05] mean, this is beautiful country and
[1:13:07] there's farmlands all around. But they
[1:13:09] didn't plant that seed yesterday and all
[1:13:11] of a sudden it's standing this
[1:13:13] tall. Nor did the farmer get out there
[1:13:15] every morning and dig it up and say, "Am
[1:13:16] I going to have a crop?" And so that's
[1:13:18] what the prophet of God is telling you.
[1:13:20] He's saying that farmer, as long as you
[1:13:22] keep digging up the seed, it will never
[1:13:24] grow. You interrupt the process. There's
[1:13:28] a natural process of planting that seed
[1:13:30] in the right environment, in the right
[1:13:32] ground, and allowing the right sunlight,
[1:13:35] just the right amount of sunlight to
[1:13:37] strike that seed in its environment. But
[1:13:40] as long as you keep digging it up and
[1:13:41] flipping up that environment, that seed
[1:13:44] will never grow because it's lacking the
[1:13:46] the nutrients that it needs and the
[1:13:48] atmosphere that it needs and the
[1:13:50] condition that it needs to bring forth
[1:13:52] life.
[1:13:54] And as long as you maybe you're here
[1:13:56] tonight and you pray for your children
[1:13:58] and man, you justounding them andounding
[1:14:00] them and hounding them. Well, are did
[1:14:02] you make a decision? Are you going to do
[1:14:03] this? You don't need to do that. You
[1:14:04] need to quit doing this. You need to
[1:14:06] quit doing
[1:14:06] that. You try to legislate your
[1:14:09] righteousness over to your children.
[1:14:11] Look, you planted that seed in the
[1:14:13] ground.
[1:14:15] Commit them to God and back off and say,
[1:14:18] "I give I've given you to the Lord and
[1:14:21] that's where it lays. quit digging it up
[1:14:23] expecting uh expecting their life to be
[1:14:26] different, but plant it and in time in
[1:14:28] the season, God will strike that heart.
[1:14:31] God will get a hold of that life and
[1:14:33] there will be nothing that can stop that
[1:14:36] seed from germatizing because then it
[1:14:38] will spring forth.
[1:14:40] But mama, daddy, quit digging it up, but
[1:14:43] plant it there and leave it there and
[1:14:45] believe that I'm going to have a harvest
[1:14:47] because God's word declared it.
[1:14:52] He says, "Every time you look at your
[1:14:54] symptoms, get this, it delays you too in
[1:14:59] your
[1:15:01] healing." But look, my back, Lord, I
[1:15:05] dealt with that one for the last
[1:15:07] month. You know, every time you look at
[1:15:09] I don't try to dwell on my ailments. My
[1:15:12] kids say, "Well, you moan a lot in the
[1:15:14] morning. That's just part of getting
[1:15:16] old."
[1:15:18] But no, we don't. You just believe.
[1:15:22] I believe that God will honor his word
[1:15:26] no matter what. I believe in laying
[1:15:28] hands on the sick.
[1:15:30] I believe in all the things that we do
[1:15:33] when we just come from our youth camp.
[1:15:34] We had amazing prayer line and I was
[1:15:37] dealing with the situation with a
[1:15:38] sciatic nerve and I I came here me and
[1:15:41] brother Brad moved this 80,000 pound
[1:15:43] couch of brother Weston's and about
[1:15:45] broke both of us down. So, I've been
[1:15:48] hurting with that for about a month now.
[1:15:49] And why we had this prayer line and
[1:15:51] we're praying for everybody just, you
[1:15:53] know, and I didn't go through the prayer
[1:15:56] line. Something said, "You should have
[1:15:58] went through." But I'm like, "God, you
[1:16:00] said you're my Huda regardless if I walk
[1:16:01] through that prayer line or
[1:16:05] not." And I just believe that if we had
[1:16:08] that kind of faith, I believe there
[1:16:10] should be prayer lines in the church. I
[1:16:11] believe there should be altar calls in
[1:16:12] the church. I believe there should be
[1:16:14] laying hands on the sick. I believe
[1:16:15] there should be the anointing of oil,
[1:16:17] but I also believe as a child of God,
[1:16:20] you have to plant that seed.
[1:16:24] I'm going to tell you, sitting in the
[1:16:25] back back there,
[1:16:26] church, you look at the backer, there's
[1:16:29] a seed that's been planted in the heart
[1:16:30] of Sister Donna and Brother Thomas, that
[1:16:33] cancer is not going to res destroy them.
[1:16:36] But they put a seed of faith in the
[1:16:38] ground saying, "We're coming out of this
[1:16:40] thing."
[1:16:42] God has given this church a
[1:16:44] testimony. And I look around and I see
[1:16:46] where many of us have been and where God
[1:16:49] has taken us. All it is is we're
[1:16:51] committing that promise to the Lord and
[1:16:53] committing it and not turning it over
[1:16:55] and digging it up and trying to
[1:16:57] manufacture something and create
[1:16:59] something that's not to be created, but
[1:17:00] it's taking God at his word and realize
[1:17:04] that he God has restored something back
[1:17:06] to the people. He's restored faith back
[1:17:09] to the people to believe. Otherwise, why
[1:17:12] would he send us a
[1:17:15] message? If Pentecost was all we needed
[1:17:18] is if uh Wesleyanism and Methodism and
[1:17:21] and and whatever Luther's message and
[1:17:24] all of that, if that was all we needed,
[1:17:27] then why did God send a prophet? Because
[1:17:30] God sent a prophet? Because he knew in
[1:17:33] the end time there was going to be a
[1:17:35] people. They needed more than
[1:17:36] justification. They needed more than
[1:17:38] sanctification. They needed more than
[1:17:41] just the gifts of the spirit back in the
[1:17:43] body. They needed the life on the
[1:17:45] inside. And that life on the inside will
[1:17:48] germatize the seed that was planted. And
[1:17:51] it can't help but to come forth.
[1:17:54] Praise the Lord. We're not little baby
[1:17:56] Christians today, church. What we saw
[1:17:59] back in the 50s and 60s was a bride in
[1:18:01] her infancy. But no longer is she a
[1:18:04] bride in her infasy. She is a mature
[1:18:06] woman with the mature word. And it's now
[1:18:09] it's time to speak to the mountains that
[1:18:11] we face.
[1:18:13] Because God had once again charged the
[1:18:16] people with power to believe
[1:18:21] to believe.
[1:18:23] Plant that seed in faith.
[1:18:27] Water that seed with
[1:18:30] thanksgiving and expect a
[1:18:34] harvest. Give that to you again. Plant,
[1:18:37] if you got a pen and paper, write it
[1:18:39] down. Plant that seed in
[1:18:42] faith. Water that seed with
[1:18:49] thanksgiving. Not not wow, he hadn't
[1:18:51] done nothing yet. That ain't
[1:18:52] thanksgiving. I'm talking about thank
[1:18:54] you Lord for saving me. Thank you, Lord,
[1:18:56] for giving me the Holy Ghost. Thank you,
[1:18:58] Lord, for saving my children. Thank you,
[1:18:59] Lord, for restoring my marriage. Thank
[1:19:01] you, Lord, for doing this. Thank you,
[1:19:02] Lord, for healing my body. Thank you,
[1:19:04] Lord. Thank you, Lord. And come into the
[1:19:06] house of God with an atmosphere of
[1:19:08] thanksgiving and create an atmosphere so
[1:19:11] that your neighbor, your brother, your
[1:19:13] sister can catch a fire and have that
[1:19:16] same courage to say, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:19:18] And come expecting a harvest.
[1:19:22] Don't expecting anything less.
[1:19:30] Brother says, "In a time of decision,
[1:19:33] 1959, a farmer just commits the seed to
[1:19:37] the ground." Boy, that just seems so
[1:19:40] simple, Brother
[1:19:41] Joe. I mean, you mean that's all we got
[1:19:44] to do?
[1:19:45] Absolutely. We want to complicate the
[1:19:47] messes. We want to complicate the
[1:19:49] gospel. We want to complicate everything
[1:19:51] and think, "Well, we got to do some Hail
[1:19:52] Marys and our messes. Hail Marys. If we
[1:19:56] don't listen to three sermons a day,
[1:19:57] then we're not going to get our request.
[1:20:01] We try to legislate legal make it
[1:20:03] legalistic.
[1:20:07] No, the farmer just commits to seed to
[1:20:10] the ground. He gets he gets the best
[1:20:12] seed that he can find and he puts it in
[1:20:16] the ground because he's made a decision
[1:20:18] that he wants a crop. Did you hear that?
[1:20:22] He made a decision that he wants a crop.
[1:20:26] And some of you made a decision this
[1:20:28] morning. I saw you get up and walk
[1:20:29] around because you're expecting a crop.
[1:20:33] Whatever it is, put that seed there.
[1:20:36] Don't dig it up. Notice he says now,
[1:20:39] "But if he's got the best seed that he
[1:20:40] can buy, you know, he lays it in the
[1:20:42] ground. He just commits it to the ground
[1:20:44] and don't look anymore." He said,
[1:20:46] "That's up to God to take care of the
[1:20:48] rest of it. And the best seed that I can
[1:20:49] find is the word of God." because it's
[1:20:52] eternal. Just commit it in your heart,
[1:20:55] not your head.
[1:20:59] Notice I want I want to stop here for a
[1:21:01] minute and kind of bring this out and
[1:21:02] take this quote here and dissect it.
[1:21:04] This is paragraph 38. He says, just
[1:21:06] commit it in your heart, not your head.
[1:21:10] He goes, "You'll keep digging it around,
[1:21:12] turning it around, saying,"Well, the
[1:21:14] doctor said so and so, and my pastor
[1:21:16] said the days of miracles has passed."
[1:21:18] But in your heart, let it alone. See, in
[1:21:22] your mind, that's the battleground.
[1:21:24] That's where it comes. Well, you know,
[1:21:25] I'm not feeling any better, and you
[1:21:27] know, the kids seem to keep going
[1:21:29] further and further and further away,
[1:21:30] and I don't seem to have the right
[1:21:32] desires or the right change come over
[1:21:34] me. Notice he said don't commit it with
[1:21:36] your head but you commit it with your
[1:21:38] heart
[1:21:41] and leave it alone.
[1:21:44] And he said start acting if you already
[1:21:46] had your crop.
[1:21:51] Get your sickles all sharp. Get ready to
[1:21:55] go into the field. Don't dig it up every
[1:21:57] morning. Just leave it there. If it's
[1:21:59] germatized, it'll work. It'll raise up a
[1:22:02] crop. And when a man plants a seed, this
[1:22:04] is in the court trial, 1964. So, brother
[1:22:07] Brandham kept this theme through his
[1:22:09] ministry. So, we find here in 1964, he
[1:22:12] said, "Now, when a man plants a seed, if
[1:22:14] you're a farmer, you know anything about
[1:22:15] planting a seed, if you plant a seed
[1:22:17] today, some corn, and you put it in your
[1:22:20] garden, tomorrow morning you dig it out
[1:22:21] and dig it up and look at it and say,
[1:22:23] "Well, there's no difference in it."
[1:22:27] That's most of us, especially
[1:22:30] parents. Guilty. Come on.
[1:22:33] You know, there's no difference in it.
[1:22:35] It'll never come up. It can't do it.
[1:22:37] When you dig it up, you spoiled the
[1:22:40] picture right
[1:22:41] there. You got to commit it to the
[1:22:44] earth. And when it's up to the earth to
[1:22:46] it's up to the earth to do the rest of
[1:22:48] it. And every time you look at your
[1:22:50] symptoms and testify about them and
[1:22:53] complain about them, God can never heal
[1:22:55] you.
[1:22:58] You commit it to God and believe his
[1:23:01] word and he will bring it to pass.
[1:23:04] So we start this sermon out with just a
[1:23:07] small amount of
[1:23:09] faith. But you don't have to just keep a
[1:23:11] small amount of
[1:23:12] faith. But see, if you just commit it to
[1:23:15] God and believe his word, that little
[1:23:17] bit of faith can grow into a bigger
[1:23:19] faith and a bigger faith and a bigger
[1:23:21] faith and a bigger faith until you have
[1:23:24] great big faith. You know, you think
[1:23:26] about the prophet said,
[1:23:29] "Faith has great big muscles
[1:23:32] and hair on his chest." I'm like,
[1:23:34] "That's my kind of
[1:23:36] man." Not a little shriveled up,
[1:23:39] nothing, a little weak, nothing I can't
[1:23:40] believe, but just one that's willing to
[1:23:43] believe against all odds.
[1:23:46] See, whether it's sprouting or whether
[1:23:48] it's whatever it's doing, you don't
[1:23:49] care. God promised it. And potentially,
[1:23:52] you have your healing when you accept
[1:23:54] it. But it's in seed form.
[1:23:59] Whatever you have need of, not just
[1:24:00] healing because a lot of times, you
[1:24:02] know, we think about healing in that
[1:24:03] aspect, but whatever your need is when
[1:24:07] you came or you walked around this
[1:24:09] morning, maybe it was in seed
[1:24:13] form, but it is not always going to
[1:24:16] remain in seed form.
[1:24:21] I'm here to tell you I'm expecting a
[1:24:24] miracle in the back.
[1:24:27] That seed of faith that's not let it
[1:24:30] bother me. Let's not let it change who I
[1:24:33] am, beat me down and go and hide under a
[1:24:36] tree and you know, woe is me. It's going
[1:24:38] to flourish. Just like a brother Ron
[1:24:41] Spencer, you look at that. He's four or
[1:24:43] five years now. And for the first time
[1:24:45] in many, many, many years, he's had
[1:24:48] hundreds or not hundreds, but he's had
[1:24:50] many, many, many brain scans. And just
[1:24:52] last month, he finally got a clean brain
[1:24:58] scan. Why is
[1:25:00] that? Did he dig it up every morning?
[1:25:03] Did he go back to the doctor's report
[1:25:04] and say, "Well, how can this happen? How
[1:25:06] when you keep digging it up, you hinder
[1:25:08] your faith?" But he committed it to the
[1:25:10] to the Lord. And for the first time in
[1:25:13] four or five years, he's got a clean
[1:25:15] brain scan because he planted that seed
[1:25:18] in faith and he watered that seed with
[1:25:20] thanksgiving. And he was in the back
[1:25:22] office throwing up, but he'd come out
[1:25:24] and preach and he continued to preach
[1:25:26] and show forth a real son of God how he
[1:25:30] should respond under the
[1:25:32] trial. And that's what I'm trying to
[1:25:34] tell you this morning. If you asked for
[1:25:37] an oak tree and I gave you an acorn.
[1:25:43] Well, I wanted an oak tree. Well, dummy,
[1:25:45] you got it.
[1:25:48] Plant it in the ground. Expect it to
[1:25:50] grow forth. Well, it's going to take a
[1:25:52] long time. Well, if you keep looking at
[1:25:54] it, it
[1:25:55] will put the proess in the dirt and put
[1:25:58] the son of God on it and you will see
[1:26:01] God take that little acorn and raise up
[1:26:05] a tree. And that's what I'm telling you.
[1:26:08] The prophet of God said, "If you needed
[1:26:09] a loaf of bread, Brother Tommy, cuz you
[1:26:11] were starving and he gave you 25 cents."
[1:26:14] You ain't doing that today, but he gave
[1:26:16] you 25 cents. He says, "You can just go
[1:26:19] skipping and rancing through the land."
[1:26:21] Why? because you got the purchase price.
[1:26:23] You may not have the loaf of bread, but
[1:26:26] you got what it takes to get the loaf.
[1:26:28] And what am I telling you this morning?
[1:26:30] God has restored power back to the
[1:26:32] church. He put in your hands the
[1:26:35] purchase power. Hallelujah. Whatever you
[1:26:37] have need of, you can skip and jump and
[1:26:39] and leap and praise God because you got
[1:26:42] what it takes to get that tree to grow.
[1:26:47] He put in your possession, bride, the
[1:26:50] purchase price, the Holy Ghost, the
[1:26:52] power of the word.
[1:26:54] It'll make that seed live.
[1:26:59] If you ask for an oak tree and you gave
[1:27:01] me an acorn, potentially I have an oak
[1:27:04] tree.
[1:27:07] You just matter on how you looking at
[1:27:08] it.
[1:27:11] You give me an oak tree, I'm a hunter.
[1:27:13] I'm like, give me a white oak.
[1:27:17] Dear love white oak.
[1:27:20] I'm going to plant
[1:27:22] it. And I'm not only going to plant it,
[1:27:24] but I'm going to expect
[1:27:27] it. And if you ask for a car or an ear
[1:27:30] of corn, excuse me. Some of you asking
[1:27:32] for a car, I cannot help
[1:27:35] you. I may be able to go pick off an ear
[1:27:37] of corn, but a car, we going to have
[1:27:39] some trouble. You got to have some
[1:27:41] strong faith.
[1:27:43] But if if I give you an ear of corn and
[1:27:47] or you gave me a I need an ear of corn,
[1:27:48] you gave me a grain of corn, potentially
[1:27:51] I have an ear corn, then commit it to
[1:27:54] the ground and water it. See, that's the
[1:27:56] key.
[1:27:58] You can have that seed all day long in
[1:28:00] your
[1:28:01] hand and you can put it in the ground. I
[1:28:04] commit it to God. I commit it to God. I
[1:28:05] commit it to God. But you ain't watering
[1:28:07] it.
[1:28:09] You ain't bringing it into the sunlight
[1:28:12] of the
[1:28:13] word. No, but water it and keep all the
[1:28:19] weeds, all that unbelief, all the
[1:28:23] doubts, all the mind battles. Keep all
[1:28:25] the weeds away from it that would draw
[1:28:28] straight from the ground around it. Keep
[1:28:30] the weeds out. Then it will
[1:28:32] automatically grow because it's
[1:28:34] committed and is a germmitized seed.
[1:28:38] See, God will send a prophet in our day
[1:28:40] and take something so
[1:28:43] simple but yet make it so profound that
[1:28:46] we know how to believe as children of
[1:28:48] God. Little story of a seed being
[1:28:50] planted in the ground. But think about
[1:28:52] that seed. When you think about the
[1:28:55] promise of God and you think about your
[1:28:58] trial and you look at what lays in that
[1:29:01] word and he's simply telling you how to
[1:29:04] get a
[1:29:06] crop, plant it, order it, and expect a
[1:29:12] harvest. The Bible says in Psalms 126,
[1:29:16] "The day they that sew in
[1:29:18] tears shall reap in joy."
[1:29:23] He that goeth forth and weepeth bearing
[1:29:26] precious seed shall doubtless come again
[1:29:28] with rejoicing bringing his sheath with
[1:29:32] him. You know as a parent there is many
[1:29:34] tears shed for your
[1:29:36] children. You pray that they make the
[1:29:39] right decisions. You pray that they come
[1:29:40] to the Lord. You pray and you pray and
[1:29:43] there's a lot of things and we find here
[1:29:45] that you know as a farmer the sewing
[1:29:48] season is the most difficult
[1:29:51] season. This is a season where you got
[1:29:53] to break up the ground that's been dried
[1:29:55] through the heat of the sun and it's
[1:29:57] been baked in and everything's been
[1:29:59] baked and just hard. And you know, a lot
[1:30:02] of times as a parent, every kid is
[1:30:05] different. At least mine are.
[1:30:08] You can't you can't do for one the way
[1:30:11] you've done for all the others because
[1:30:13] what works on one may not work on the
[1:30:15] other. So you have to kind of find how
[1:30:18] do I break that fow
[1:30:21] ground. And when you notice that that's
[1:30:23] the sewing time is the hardest time.
[1:30:25] It's a time of labor of of sorrow. A lot
[1:30:28] of prayers go into it. It's the burden
[1:30:30] of the farmer. And no doubt when all
[1:30:33] that labor is done and he's exerted all
[1:30:36] his efforts and all his energies, no
[1:30:38] doubt there's weeping because of the
[1:30:41] stress of the
[1:30:42] load. But you know the expectation of
[1:30:46] harvest, the
[1:30:48] expectation that there's going to be a
[1:30:50] crop that's manifest, it exceeds by
[1:30:54] greater all the sweat, all the tears,
[1:30:58] all the labor, all the worry of the
[1:31:01] sewing season.
[1:31:04] So what are you saying, brother Joe? I'm
[1:31:05] telling you, just like a mother, a wife,
[1:31:08] a lady who's pregnant, she's going to go
[1:31:10] through pains. They call birth pains.
[1:31:13] I'm not going to get graphic, don't
[1:31:14] worry. Where they go through the birth
[1:31:16] pains and you know, and it may be that
[1:31:18] she's in certain stages of the pregnancy
[1:31:20] and then that day comes and you know,
[1:31:23] then there's a lot of a lot of shouting,
[1:31:27] a lot of
[1:31:29] shouting. Yeah. There's things that take
[1:31:31] place. There's a lot of pain.
[1:31:36] And just a few, not a few minutes
[1:31:38] because sometimes it could be hours. I'm
[1:31:39] not going to demoralize or diminish the
[1:31:42] impact of it. But there's a Tommy, don't
[1:31:44] look at me and laugh like
[1:31:46] that, Tommy. Like, you know what I'm
[1:31:48] talking about. You ain't never been
[1:31:51] there. But there's a lot of pain that
[1:31:54] goes with But after that child is born,
[1:31:58] the pain immediately leaves. and she's
[1:32:01] holding that little cuddlebug in her
[1:32:03] arms. That life is now in her
[1:32:08] possession. She's not thinking about all
[1:32:11] the pain and all the worry. Now, don't
[1:32:13] ask her. She wants another child because
[1:32:15] she'd probably kick you in the
[1:32:17] face. But months go by and she's
[1:32:20] enjoying this child and she does it all
[1:32:22] over
[1:32:25] again. Because the Bible would tell us
[1:32:29] when you sew in tears, you're going to
[1:32:31] reap in
[1:32:33] joy. And it knows that many times in our
[1:32:36] Christian journey, there's a lot of
[1:32:37] struggles along the way. There's a lot
[1:32:40] of birth plains along the way. There's a
[1:32:42] lot of hardships along the way. But I'll
[1:32:46] tell you, don't abort the pregnancy.
[1:32:50] Can I say that? Don't abort the
[1:32:51] pregnancy. Some of us take a little bit
[1:32:53] longer to to come out. Some of us take a
[1:32:55] little bit longer to manifest. Some of
[1:32:57] us take a little bit longer to be that
[1:32:59] life and have that life on display. Some
[1:33:02] of us are in the labor pain, the labor
[1:33:04] process a lot longer than others. But
[1:33:07] don't abort it. Don't stop it. Don't
[1:33:09] give up on it. You know, like a what
[1:33:11] your prophet said that a son of God can
[1:33:13] go a long time before he ever recognizes
[1:33:15] that he's a son. And you may have people
[1:33:18] sitting around you right now. You look
[1:33:20] at them and you're like, there ain't no
[1:33:21] hope in the world for them to ever get
[1:33:23] right. You don't know what God's planted
[1:33:26] on the inside of that. The only thing
[1:33:28] I'm asking you to do is create an
[1:33:30] atmosphere each and every service so
[1:33:33] that no matter what who it may be, one
[1:33:36] sws, but the other waters, but God
[1:33:38] giveth the increase. And that's what
[1:33:40] we're looking for today is to be a
[1:33:41] church to create an atmosphere so that
[1:33:45] others can be born again and have their
[1:33:48] needs met by the power of God.
[1:33:53] So joy is more than equivalent of the
[1:33:56] weariness and the sorrow. That child
[1:33:59] being held in that arm far exceeds the
[1:34:03] pain that they face. So I want to
[1:34:07] encourage you even like of
[1:34:09] Elton Kentucky to prepare for a
[1:34:13] harvest. Prepare for a harvest.
[1:34:18] Church has been in a growing season for
[1:34:20] a long time. Church has come through the
[1:34:23] the breaking of the fow ground for a
[1:34:26] long time. It's been a
[1:34:28] while. There's been some hurts. There's
[1:34:30] been some tears. There's been some
[1:34:32] sewing. It's time for a harvest.
[1:34:36] Look what God is doing. God's adding
[1:34:38] people.
[1:34:40] Starting to
[1:34:41] add. Starting to say, "Look, I'm behind
[1:34:44] this ministry. I'm behind this. This is
[1:34:46] my work. Now, I'm going places not even
[1:34:48] in my notes right now, but I'm telling
[1:34:50] you, God is behind the work here.
[1:34:54] God's not taking away from it. God is
[1:34:56] rebuilding re from other places. Now,
[1:34:59] they're looking to move. There's seeds
[1:35:01] that are going to be planted. Amen.
[1:35:04] God's not done with ELT. God's not done
[1:35:07] with this church. God is only on the
[1:35:09] starting point. Look, you have labored
[1:35:11] for years now to to get through some
[1:35:14] very hard seasons.
[1:35:16] some very tough baked in ground with the
[1:35:20] word.
[1:35:21] And now that word is being able to plant
[1:35:24] seeds of life and expects people to move
[1:35:28] in and to water that with their praise
[1:35:30] and get behind it and have uh such an
[1:35:33] atmosphere like we had this morning.
[1:35:35] That atmosphere wasn't created because
[1:35:38] somebody stands stands behind the pull
[1:35:39] pit. That atmosphere was created because
[1:35:42] there was a seed on the inside of your
[1:35:44] heart calling out for God. Watering that
[1:35:47] seed with the word and with your
[1:35:49] thanksgiving. And I'm here to tell you,
[1:35:51] prepare for harvest. Prepare. Plant that
[1:35:53] seed in the ground. And expect God to do
[1:35:56] the miraculous.
[1:36:00] Expect God to get a hold of that heart.
[1:36:02] Expect God to fill your child with the
[1:36:04] Holy Ghost. Expect God to heal that
[1:36:06] body. Expect God to do what he said
[1:36:08] he'll do. Come under an expectation
[1:36:11] service after service after service and
[1:36:13] create an atmosphere every single time
[1:36:16] and put your shoulder to the wheel.
[1:36:20] Lord, well, how do I put
[1:36:23] my I don't care who it is. Get behind
[1:36:26] the work. Put your shoulder to it and
[1:36:29] let's move this
[1:36:31] [Applause]
[1:36:33] thing. Amen.
[1:36:37] Put your shoulder to it. Give a good
[1:36:39] amen sometime behind the word. Create an
[1:36:42] atmosphere.
[1:36:44] You may shock your neighbor. Shock them.
[1:36:50] [Applause]
[1:36:56] I believe we got a promise. I believe
[1:36:58] he's here. I believe the power is back
[1:37:01] in the body.
[1:37:03] It's okay to say amen. It's okay to
[1:37:06] shout. It's okay to get Pentecostal.
[1:37:09] [Applause]
[1:37:14] Come on, church.
[1:37:16] You say, "Well, God ain't done nothing
[1:37:18] for me." Are you sitting here tonight?
[1:37:20] Are you breathing tonight? I say he's
[1:37:22] done enough for you. I say he's done
[1:37:25] enough right there. You got breath in
[1:37:27] your lungs and praise him about it.
[1:37:32] Got a desire to come to the house of
[1:37:35] God. I say rejoice in that desire.
[1:37:38] [Applause]
[1:37:41] Prepare for a harvest.
[1:37:44] Man,
[1:37:49] some of you need to go get you some egg
[1:37:51] cartons.
[1:37:53] You said, "What do you mean?" Come on. I
[1:37:56] mean, go get some egg cars and expect
[1:37:59] them to fill up.
[1:38:02] Well, I ain't got no chickens. It don't
[1:38:04] matter. We got neighbors.
[1:38:09] We got neighbors. They got good
[1:38:11] chickens. They lay good eggs. Bring your
[1:38:14] empty carton to church and expect God to
[1:38:18] fill it up. I say, "Fill it up, Lord.
[1:38:21] Heal the sick, deliver the lost, call
[1:38:23] the backslider back. I'm bringing my egg
[1:38:26] cart into the house of God.
[1:38:31] I'm not depending on Brother Brad to put
[1:38:32] his eggs in there. I'm depending on God
[1:38:34] to put his promise in there. Fill it up,
[1:38:37] Lord.
[1:38:43] We have a
[1:38:45] promise. Prepare to reap what thou hast
[1:38:48] sown. Brother Thomas, you've been
[1:38:51] faithful.
[1:38:55] I'm going to tell you, I love your
[1:38:56] pastor.
[1:38:58] He and I have great friendship.
[1:39:04] He has stayed steady. He said, "Why are
[1:39:07] you doing this, Brother Joe?" Cuz I'm
[1:39:08] giving him a rose today cuz I may not be
[1:39:10] here tomorrow to give him a reef. That's
[1:39:12] right. But you're going to know where I
[1:39:14] stand with your pastor. I ain't saying
[1:39:16] he's dying. Don't get get that out of
[1:39:17] your head.
[1:39:20] But he stayed the course.
[1:39:24] Can I say that? And some of you have
[1:39:26] stayed the course. You have been shook.
[1:39:29] You have been broken up. The ground has
[1:39:32] been hard. It's been sown. It's been
[1:39:34] talked about. People gave up on you, but
[1:39:36] God ain't give up on you. God remained
[1:39:40] faithful. Now, let's expect a harvest.
[1:39:43] We've been through the hard season.
[1:39:45] We've been through the summer season.
[1:39:46] Let's get into the springtime as God
[1:39:49] pour it out. Lord, we want a revival. We
[1:39:52] want a Holy Ghost revival in this
[1:39:56] church. I'm going to expect it. I'm
[1:39:58] going to create an atmosphere. I'm going
[1:40:00] to water with my praise. I'm going to
[1:40:02] believe God.
[1:40:05] Come on. Can somebody say amen to that?
[1:40:07] [Applause]
[1:40:12] Prepare to reap what you have sown.
[1:40:17] Brother Thomas, prepare to reap what you
[1:40:21] have sown.
[1:40:23] You have sown stability in the message.
[1:40:29] He may not have all of it all figured
[1:40:32] out. Who does?
[1:40:37] But he's been faithful
[1:40:40] at that post of duty Sunday after
[1:40:43] Sunday, Wednesday after Wednesday,
[1:40:45] service after service, house call after
[1:40:47] house call, doctor visit after doctor
[1:40:52] visit.
[1:40:55] Prepare. I want you to prepare, church.
[1:41:00] You got special meetings in two weeks.
[1:41:03] Let me ask you, what are you going to do
[1:41:04] to prepare?
[1:41:07] Let's bring it down. Let's get it off of
[1:41:09] brother Tom for a minute. What are you
[1:41:10] going to do to prepare? Well, brother
[1:41:13] Joe, I'm going to cook a meal. That's
[1:41:14] great. We appreciate that. But we ain't
[1:41:17] eating that meal in here.
[1:41:19] What are we going to do in here? What
[1:41:22] are we going to do at home? Are you
[1:41:24] going to get there and begin to pray and
[1:41:26] get up early in the morning and seek
[1:41:28] God's face and say, "God, you gave us a
[1:41:30] promise. Lord, we ain't had means in
[1:41:32] years, but I'm coming expecting. I'm
[1:41:34] coming believing. I'm coming for a
[1:41:36] supernatural outpour. I'm coming
[1:41:38] expecting God to pour it out. I'm
[1:41:40] expecting those balconies to be filled
[1:41:42] up. I'm expecting God to move on the
[1:41:44] backsliders.
[1:41:46] I'm under great expectation.
[1:41:50] You know, there's people that ain't
[1:41:51] sitting here. They used to sit here.
[1:41:54] But what are you going to be doing for
[1:41:56] the next two weeks?
[1:41:58] Well, I'm just going to let the ministry
[1:42:00] pray for them. It's their
[1:42:02] responsibility. They get paid for it
[1:42:04] anyway. Shame on
[1:42:07] you. Kind of mentality we have around
[1:42:09] this message. God's giving power back to
[1:42:11] the church and we want to dumb it down
[1:42:13] like that.
[1:42:15] It ain't the ministry's responsibility.
[1:42:16] It's the ministry's responsibility to
[1:42:18] preach to you the unadulterated word.
[1:42:20] It's our collective responsibility to
[1:42:23] create an atmosphere that we have this
[1:42:26] morning that a young daughter of God can
[1:42:27] come and give her heart to the Lord and
[1:42:29] say, "I don't want to live the way I was
[1:42:30] living, but I want to serve God from
[1:42:32] this day forth." What about it for us?
[1:42:35] Create an atmosphere, put that seed on
[1:42:38] the inside and expect a supernatural
[1:42:40] harvest.
[1:42:46] I said I wasn't going to get
[1:42:48] assimilated, but my goodness.
[1:42:52] I'm sorry, church. No, I'm not.
[1:42:57] I only have two gears off and on.
[1:43:00] Right now, I think I'm on.
[1:43:03] But I want you to be I want you I mean,
[1:43:06] I want every household. I'm not your
[1:43:08] pastor and I'm not trying to pastor you.
[1:43:09] Brother Thomas, if I'm stepping
[1:43:11] overstepping my brownies, you just tell
[1:43:12] me, "Hey, you're overstepping." But I
[1:43:15] want every household to begin to make
[1:43:17] preparation.
[1:43:20] Don't think about what you going to cook
[1:43:21] for the the cooking and whatever y'all
[1:43:23] call it around here. What y'all call
[1:43:25] that? Carry in. Cook in. Carry in.
[1:43:28] Excuse
[1:43:29] me. Well, worried about who made what
[1:43:32] and what made who and all this other
[1:43:33] stuff. Don't worry about that. I'm
[1:43:35] talking about, man, when you occupy this
[1:43:37] pew, you come 30 minutes early and you
[1:43:39] begin to pray, you begin to seek God.
[1:43:42] And I ain't talking about seeking God
[1:43:43] with your eyes closed, you half asleep.
[1:43:45] I'm talking about seeking God and
[1:43:47] saying, "God, we want something. We got
[1:43:49] special meetings. Brother Timothy's
[1:43:50] coming. Brother Andrew's coming. I'm
[1:43:52] coming. And we're going to have a
[1:43:54] revival in the house of God. We're going
[1:43:56] to see the sick healed. We're going to
[1:43:58] see the lost saved. We're going to see
[1:44:00] sons and daughters of God filled with
[1:44:01] the Holy Ghost. I'm coming for revival.
[1:44:04] I'm coming with an expectation.
[1:44:09] My my my my. Why not believe for it?
[1:44:16] Why not believe for it?
[1:44:21] They can get excited at a ball game. I
[1:44:24] know. Hey, look. I get excited at a ball
[1:44:26] game.
[1:44:28] It's all
[1:44:29] right. But I tell you what, I'm not
[1:44:32] shouting more there than I am here.
[1:44:36] Ain't no hypocrite in Joe
[1:44:39] Adams. You ask my kids, man, I'll scared
[1:44:42] the fool out of them shouting in the
[1:44:44] house. But when I come to the house of
[1:44:46] God, I know church, I know what he's
[1:44:50] done for me.
[1:44:53] I know where I was headed. I know I was
[1:44:56] that beggar, brother Thomas, that was
[1:44:57] crippled. Maybe not crippled with my
[1:44:59] feet, but I was crippled in my spirit.
[1:45:01] And there kept been something crying
[1:45:02] out. Lord, just change me. Lord, I want
[1:45:04] to do different. Lord, I don't want to
[1:45:05] live this way anymore. And I kept coming
[1:45:07] back to the same spot. I kept coming
[1:45:09] back to the bottle. I kept coming back
[1:45:11] to the party. I kept coming back to this
[1:45:14] and to that. I couldn't I couldn't
[1:45:15] overcome it. I couldn't do this. But one
[1:45:17] night,
[1:45:19] one night when I got to my end where I
[1:45:21] didn't want to live anymore, Brother
[1:45:23] Joe. And in my mind, I just wanted to
[1:45:24] commit suicide. And I was driving off
[1:45:27] down the road and I may have told you
[1:45:28] this many times, but I keep telling it
[1:45:30] because I want you to know how dark I
[1:45:31] was. I didn't care about living. I
[1:45:33] didn't care about the next day. I'm
[1:45:35] ready to end my life. But a voice spoke
[1:45:37] from the darkness and said, "Turn your
[1:45:39] car around."
[1:45:41] Let me tell you, if you knew who I was
[1:45:42] then, you would not believe who I am
[1:45:44] now.
[1:45:46] But I'm telling you, there was a
[1:45:48] grandmother of mine that prayed for a
[1:45:50] grandson and say, "Lord, get a hold of
[1:45:52] him." And on a on a maybe 12:00 on a
[1:45:55] dark night, God came in my car.
[1:46:00] Let me tell you, I turned that car
[1:46:02] around. I turned this life around. I
[1:46:04] turned it all around.
[1:46:07] We don't need all that shouting.
[1:46:11] We don't need Look, we That ain't how we
[1:46:14] do it in Kentucky.
[1:46:18] Well, Kentucky, you invited me.
[1:46:24] That ain't how what are you? You the
[1:46:28] pope.
[1:46:32] You done got a monopoly on how we
[1:46:34] supposed to act in church.
[1:46:36] Look at that. Look at that. That
[1:46:39] crippled
[1:46:40] man. He had planted a seed that he
[1:46:44] wanted to walk.
[1:46:47] He didn't know what it meant to walk,
[1:46:50] but he watched others.
[1:46:53] Maybe doubt he studied their step, their
[1:46:57] stride. Maybe he looked at a little five
[1:46:59] foot John over there and
[1:47:07] watched. Yeah, got your back,
[1:47:10] Jack. Maybe he study. He's like, "Man,
[1:47:13] if I could have my feet, maybe I go to
[1:47:15] his
[1:47:16] gym. I'll pump some iron with Tommy
[1:47:19] John."
[1:47:26] No doubt. Day after day, wishing he
[1:47:31] could be you.
[1:47:34] Do you realize others out there wish
[1:47:36] they had the opportunity to sit in one
[1:47:39] of these pews?
[1:47:42] This man had never ever
[1:47:44] ever walked, never ever
[1:47:48] ever wiggled his toes. He didn't know
[1:47:52] the feeling to move his ankles or his
[1:47:55] feet to feel sensation through his lower
[1:47:59] extremities. But
[1:48:02] God God planted a seed on the inside of
[1:48:06] that man.
[1:48:07] It took over 40 years before the right
[1:48:11] man with the right word got to that
[1:48:13] right seat.
[1:48:16] But it got there.
[1:48:19] Do you hear what I'm telling you? It may
[1:48:22] have took 20 years to get to where we
[1:48:24] are today as a church. 30 years, 40
[1:48:27] years, I don't know. But we're here.
[1:48:29] Amen.
[1:48:31] And all I'm asking you,
[1:48:33] church, all I'm asking you tonight, you
[1:48:36] got to make a decision. What he's
[1:48:38] preaching, either it's true or it's not
[1:48:40] true. What John was preaching, what
[1:48:42] Peter was preaching, that crippled man
[1:48:44] had a belief, it's the truth or it's not
[1:48:46] the truth. But he says, "Such as I have,
[1:48:49] give I to thee in the name of Jesus of
[1:48:51] Nazareth, rise up and walk." And a man
[1:48:54] who had never walked before, a man who
[1:48:56] had never felt sensation before, jumped
[1:48:58] up on his feet and began to leap and to
[1:49:02] shout and to praise God. And if he can
[1:49:05] do that in a crippled state, what about
[1:49:08] us in our crippled
[1:49:11] state? That's why I rejoice. That's why
[1:49:14] I don't care what you think about me.
[1:49:17] Because if you was sitting in the chair
[1:49:19] that I was sitting in,
[1:49:22] if you was in that place, you didn't
[1:49:24] want to live. Just like I was in that
[1:49:26] place I didn't want to live. I was
[1:49:27] looking to die. I was ready to end this
[1:49:29] life. Oh, if you can over realize the
[1:49:32] pain that I was feeling and the pain
[1:49:34] that I was under, but no, notice when
[1:49:36] nobody cared, he did.
[1:49:39] When nobody checked in, he did. And now
[1:49:42] all he's wanting is somebody to jump and
[1:49:44] to shout and to praise God. And nobody
[1:49:47] will do it but I will. I'll do it
[1:49:50] because he's done it for me. He saved
[1:49:52] me. He filled me. And he's delivered me.
[1:49:55] And I'm here to tell you, I rejoice in
[1:49:58] what he's done.
[1:50:05] So what about it? ELT. Yes, some of you
[1:50:09] going to stay there just occupy a
[1:50:13] pew. Well, brother Joe, you know it
[1:50:15] ain't all about
[1:50:17] emotion. I
[1:50:18] know. I
[1:50:20] know. But I tell you one thing, you let
[1:50:24] me slam a hammer down on your thumb,
[1:50:30] I guarantee you a shout. Amen.
[1:50:35] Oh, you don't like that carnal that
[1:50:37] carnal analogy, do you?
[1:50:42] But the Holy Ghost ain't no hammer. But
[1:50:45] I tell you what, you get a taste of them
[1:50:46] one time.
[1:50:49] You get a t look more than just a creed,
[1:50:52] more than just an ideology, more than
[1:50:54] just man's conception, but you get the
[1:50:57] taste of the true baptism of the Holy
[1:50:59] Ghost. You'll never know how you will
[1:51:01] act. Let me tell you, I seen a little
[1:51:04] Menite girl up in a service few months
[1:51:06] ago and begin to run around the church.
[1:51:08] Why? Because the Holy Ghost, you telling
[1:51:11] me she didn't know what the Holy Ghost
[1:51:12] would do. But when she felt the attack
[1:51:14] of it or she felt it come down on her,
[1:51:17] got up and begin to run around the
[1:51:19] church, what am I telling you church?
[1:51:20] That the same Holy Ghost and the same
[1:51:23] supernatural in here, Sister Jana, he's
[1:51:25] the same God.
[1:51:29] You just got to allow yourself to
[1:51:31] respond.
[1:51:33] Allow that seed to grow.
[1:51:40] You didn't stifle it, did you? Felt
[1:51:43] good, didn't it?
[1:51:46] Felt good.
[1:51:48] I'm going tell you, it feels good. I
[1:51:49] know you think, well, everybody's
[1:51:51] looking at me. Uhuh. Everybody's like, I
[1:51:53] wish I could be me. But it can.
[1:51:56] I'm just trying to prepare the harvest.
[1:51:59] Look, I'm preparing for two weeks. I'm
[1:52:01] coming back and I'm going to be in a
[1:52:04] different position. I won't be the
[1:52:06] preacher. I'm going to be the puller.
[1:52:08] And I'm here to tell you, prepare cuz
[1:52:10] you done hooked up to the wrong meal on
[1:52:13] this one because we going to pull it
[1:52:14] down. And we're going to expect God to
[1:52:17] pour out and pour out and pour out on
[1:52:19] Thursday night. Pour it out on Friday
[1:52:21] night. Pour it out on Saturday night.
[1:52:24] pour out on Sunday morning. Pour it out
[1:52:26] again and again and again. Why? Cuz you
[1:52:30] plant the seed and expect a
[1:52:34] harvest. Pour it
[1:52:36] out. Come on. It's okay to shout. It's
[1:52:39] okay to jump. It's okay to dance. It's
[1:52:41] okay. He promised it.
[1:52:48] If a minite can shout and jump and
[1:52:50] dance,
[1:52:53] my my
[1:52:56] my Come
[1:52:59] on, man. This ain't hooked up to no
[1:53:03] horse and buggy. We got astronaut power.
[1:53:08] Our has been restored to the church. You
[1:53:12] realize that we're this close from
[1:53:14] rapturing?
[1:53:17] We're this close from rapturing.
[1:53:20] You think you going to rapture sitting
[1:53:21] there with your arms folded?
[1:53:29] You better get your seat on. All that
[1:53:32] snoring you doing in the house of God.
[1:53:37] Come on, church.
[1:53:39] Church should be a safe haven. Should be
[1:53:42] a refuge. You unpack your burdens. You
[1:53:45] unpack your stresses. You know that in
[1:53:47] any moment anything can happen
[1:53:52] in the house of God. Any moment you may
[1:53:54] have come in under the weight and the
[1:53:56] load of the pressures of life, but in
[1:53:59] one moment.
[1:54:01] Harvest time.
[1:54:03] Harvest time. That bird came in. We just
[1:54:07] let
[1:54:09] you know what Superman, y'all. Never
[1:54:11] mind. I'm going to go. Superman went
[1:54:13] into a phone booth just like I'm dressed
[1:54:15] right now.
[1:54:17] But when he came out,
[1:54:19] Clark Kent was no longer Clark Kent.
[1:54:24] He come out with a big S on his chest.
[1:54:28] Said, "I am
[1:54:30] Superman." What am I telling you,
[1:54:32] church? I'm telling you, when you walk
[1:54:34] through those doors, you may have walked
[1:54:36] in one way in your clothing, but we can
[1:54:39] walk out as a super church, as the bride
[1:54:43] of Jesus Christ who's been changed. Let
[1:54:46] me tell you, there ain't no script
[1:54:48] tonight. There ain't no devil. There
[1:54:50] ain't no sin that can keep you beat down
[1:54:53] when you got the power back in church.
[1:54:56] Musicians come
[1:55:03] Power. Power for a rapture. Power for
[1:55:07] body change. Power for revival.
[1:55:13] Remember, you can't get blood. I have
[1:55:14] nothing that don't have blood in
[1:55:17] it. You're expecting a revival. The
[1:55:20] revival signs.
[1:55:23] Somebody put revival signs out. Come on.
[1:55:27] Let me tell you, they don't need to see
[1:55:28] the sign on the street. They need to see
[1:55:30] the sign in the seat.
[1:55:34] I ain't looking for revival out on the
[1:55:36] street. I'm looking for revival in the
[1:55:38] seat where sons and daughters recognize
[1:55:40] who they are. That we are sons of God.
[1:55:43] We are daughters of God. And any minute,
[1:55:45] we're going to take a rapture. Sickness
[1:55:47] can't hold us. Sin can't hold us.
[1:55:49] Depression can't hold us. Anxiety can't
[1:55:52] hold us. Cancer can't hold us. Why?
[1:55:54] Because we are in revival.
[1:55:56] [Applause]
[1:55:58] Revival's coming to the church. Amen.
[1:56:05] Rebecca, come on. I need
[1:56:08] you. What's that song you
[1:56:13] sing? It's on the tip of my
[1:56:16] tongue. Ain't no grave. There you go.
[1:56:20] And I lay my burdens down. You can go
[1:56:22] behind that one with that one. Come on,
[1:56:24] let's create an atmosphere. Ain't no
[1:56:27] grave. Ain't no grave. This body wasn't
[1:56:29] made for a grave. This body wasn't made
[1:56:31] for a grave. This body was brave for the
[1:56:34] heavenly. I would tell you today, this
[1:56:36] body was made to be changed in the
[1:56:38] moment, in the twinkling of an eye. Come
[1:56:41] on. Let's have church. Let's worship the
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:49] Lord. All right. Come on now.

[1:57:53] prison as cruel as a
[1:57:57] name. Oh, shame is a robber and he's
[1:58:02] going to take my
[1:58:04] name. Oh, my love is my
[1:58:08] redeemer. Lifting me up from the ground
[1:58:12] of love is the power. He's going to take
[1:58:17] my eyes down. There ain't no
[1:58:22] [Applause]
[1:58:24] grave. Going to hold my body
[1:58:29] down. There ain't no
[1:58:32] [Music]
[1:58:36] way going to hold
[1:58:42] my Oh, and when I hear that trumpet
[1:58:49] sound, oh, I'm going to rise up to the
