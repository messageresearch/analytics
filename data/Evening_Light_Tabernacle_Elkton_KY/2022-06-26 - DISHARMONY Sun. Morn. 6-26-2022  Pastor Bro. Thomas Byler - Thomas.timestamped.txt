[0:00] the mind of christ that's the same mind
[0:02] that should be in us all there's no
[0:03] differences in christ everyone is the
[0:06] same and i interest thee also true yolk
[0:09] fellow help those womans with labor with
[0:12] me in the gospel with clement and also
[0:15] with other my fellow laborers whose
[0:17] names are in the book of life and i'm
[0:19] sure all of you
[0:20] rejoice in the fact knowing that god has
[0:23] put your name in the book of life
[0:25] rejoice in the lord always again i say
[0:27] rejoice you know you like i said you'll
[0:30] see plaques with some of these let your
[0:32] moderation be known unto all man that
[0:35] the lord is at hand
[0:37] be careful for nothing but in everything
[0:39] by prayer and supplication with
[0:42] thanksgiving let your requests be made
[0:44] known unto god
[0:46] you know and
[0:48] that's pretty important here
[0:50] god doesn't want warriors
[0:52] if
[0:54] it's one of the things i know about the
[0:56] can you look can you get a ray from
[0:59] worrying
[1:00] no but
[1:01] worrying won't do any good it won't
[1:03] change anything i know from a fact i i
[1:06] can only i hate to say that again but i
[1:09] can only speak for myself i know that
[1:11] you can get so stressed out in life or
[1:13] so stressed in a situation you can do
[1:16] all that worrying and i realized a long
[1:18] time ago that
[1:20] that won't change anything god can
[1:22] change it but you worrying about it
[1:24] isn't going to change anything doesn't
[1:26] mean that you don't take it serious but
[1:28] there's a difference between allowing
[1:30] your body and your mind to be totally
[1:32] worried and an anxiety over something
[1:35] and sometimes letting it go and i'll
[1:37] just read a few of these scriptures
[1:39] that the lord spoke about in psalms
[1:43] 100
[1:44] you might some of you won't be able to
[1:46] keep up with me because i got this
[1:47] thompson chain reference bible psalm 127
[1:51] verse 2 it is vain for you to rise up
[1:53] early in the sit-up way to eat the bread
[1:56] of sorrows for so he that giveth his
[1:58] beloved
[2:00] sleep so
[2:02] david's saying here it's best to put
[2:03] your cares upon the lord and not worry
[2:05] about it matthew the sixth chapter and
[2:08] the 25th verse it says therefore i say
[2:10] unto you take no thought of your life
[2:13] what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink
[2:15] yet for your body what you shall put on
[2:18] it is not life more than meat and the
[2:20] body more than raiment that's true as
[2:24] true in that day as it is for today you
[2:26] know you can't make yourself an inch
[2:28] taller you can't make yourself an inch
[2:30] shorter you know there's nothing you can
[2:32] do to change who you are you just got to
[2:34] yield and he goes on to say luke 10th
[2:36] chapter and the 44th earth
[2:40] jesus answered and said on to martha
[2:42] martha thou are careful and troubled
[2:44] about many things
[2:46] you know and this goes to the story
[2:48] where mary and all the other ones were
[2:50] at jesus feet and martha was doing all
[2:52] the serving and she got to a point where
[2:55] she wanted her sister to help her and
[2:57] jesus said her sister had chosen the
[2:59] right path and it goes on luke the 12th
[3:02] chapter and the 29th verse seek ye not
[3:04] what you shall eat or what you shall
[3:06] drink neither you be of a doubtful mind
[3:09] and basically it's the same thing today
[3:11] you know you don't have to be doubtful
[3:13] god will provide for you doesn't mean
[3:15] it's going to come when you think it
[3:17] should come sometimes it doesn't happen
[3:19] that way you just have to be willing to
[3:21] yield right though
[3:23] let god have his way and then in luke
[3:25] the
[3:26] 21st chapter and the 34th verse take
[3:29] heed to yourselves at least at any time
[3:31] your hearts be overturned
[3:33] charged with suffering
[3:36] uh it's actually suffering and
[3:38] drunkenness and cares of his of this
[3:40] life so that the day come upon you
[3:42] unaware and i was thinking this morning
[3:45] as i was reading this scripture in the
[3:46] tom thompson chain reference bible i'll
[3:49] go back to it
[3:50] then i read of ephesians 4 and 6 verse
[3:53] it says to be careful in nothing but
[3:56] going back to this verse right here
[3:58] you know i think that's where we're at
[4:00] this morning i'm not saying that's where
[4:02] you're at
[4:03] as an individual looking at the clock
[4:05] before i go on a different avenue
[4:07] but i
[4:08] that's where every where the world is at
[4:10] this morning
[4:12] is
[4:13] and i was
[4:14] writing this down
[4:17] who who who am
[4:19] i or who are you
[4:21] you know there's a spiritual picture of
[4:24] that god has of you
[4:26] and an image of you that
[4:28] only god knows about you in that image
[4:31] and there's you're either in that image
[4:34] you're either a true saint of god or
[4:36] you're an unbeliever
[4:38] and that's the problem that's what the
[4:39] scripture is dealing with this morning
[4:41] here
[4:43] that i just read
[4:45] are you are you doing the things that
[4:47] the lord wants you to do in the day that
[4:49] we're living in
[4:52] are you just surfing a long life with no
[4:55] real responsibility or no real attitude
[4:58] for the things of the lord are you
[5:00] are you just
[5:02] are you just mingling in it are you just
[5:05] just going
[5:06] with the flow and not really
[5:08] consecrating yourself to the things of
[5:10] the lord this morning and that's where i
[5:12] think we're at as a as a society
[5:16] you know people aren't say they what
[5:17] they are on the outside but they're
[5:20] but the inside is not what they're
[5:22] professing to be and
[5:25] i all the preachers have been saying
[5:27] lately
[5:28] you know you don't get out of this life
[5:30] without god proving who you are this
[5:32] morning and then god knows who you are
[5:35] this morning you don't get out of this
[5:37] life without a true relationship with
[5:40] jesus christ you know i'll just finish
[5:42] with this i'm i'm all over the plate
[5:44] this morning but i would say the most i
[5:46] say this a lot
[5:49] you can't say it enough i mean you know
[5:52] the one thing that life has taught me
[5:55] about whether it's coming up here for
[5:57] the last 20 or so years
[6:00] you know if you're looking
[6:02] at people to be an example then you're
[6:05] you're starting off at the wrong foot if
[6:08] don't get me wrong brother branham as an
[6:10] example your pastor is an example
[6:13] but if you're trusting that example more
[6:16] than you should
[6:18] when something happens to that example
[6:21] it might be your father it might be
[6:23] whoever it is if you put them on a
[6:25] pedestal higher than they should be
[6:28] in your life and something happens to
[6:30] them and they fall
[6:32] then you start wavering or questioning
[6:35] your experience this morning or were you
[6:37] trusting christ or were you trusting
[6:40] their word or her word and that's what
[6:42] the scriptures deal with this morning
[6:44] that foundation that we have this
[6:46] morning has to be built on the word of
[6:49] god in jesus christ does it mean that
[6:51] you don't use people are good you know
[6:53] the bible says you know look at the
[6:56] the right example follow the right
[6:58] example but it never says to put i don't
[7:00] why i'm saying this don't ever put that
[7:03] example on a pedestal where it shouldn't
[7:05] be the only one that should be on that
[7:07] pedestal that you're serving and trying
[7:10] to
[7:11] image in your life is jesus christ in
[7:13] his example that's the image that you
[7:15] should be footing before anything else
[7:18] in your life and and i just know from
[7:21] what's going on in the world today
[7:23] there's a lot out there trying to take
[7:25] away
[7:26] your focus from what it really should be
[7:28] on this morning but don't ever let the
[7:31] enemy take your focus off of jesus
[7:33] christ this morning brother david
[7:40] this morning if we could
[7:47] sing that song a little course this
[7:48] morning more than ever before lord i

[31:00] brother glenn this morning sister sherry
[31:02] it's been a joy
[31:04] meeting them and knowing them
[31:06] brother glenn's always smiling he always
[31:08] has something good to say and
[31:10] amen
[31:12] he's not always honest because he always
[31:13] tells me i do a good job and i know it's
[31:15] different but
[31:16] but he sure makes me feel good
[31:21] amen i was kidding about singing and
[31:23] said please sing on key
[31:25] and i don't do that so i shouldn't tell
[31:28] anybody else but you know i was thinking
[31:30] as he talked about brother brad and
[31:32] brother thomas and we think about the
[31:34] things and brother brad preached the
[31:35] sermon this
[31:36] then some time ago and
[31:38] he's talking about a
[31:40] they went to eat and
[31:42] ministered that he was with a friend he
[31:44] had asked the lady and he said you know
[31:46] discerning the spirits of the people
[31:48] that you're dealing with and he said
[31:50] here i was and i began to think about
[31:52] that and the other it's been a few weeks
[31:54] ago i went through
[31:56] burger king to get something to eat and
[31:57] get some ice and
[31:59] and uh
[32:00] this young
[32:02] lady was there at the
[32:04] window and i said well how are you today
[32:05] she said i'm not doing very good i don't
[32:07] feel good
[32:08] of course you know the first thing that
[32:10] popped in my mind i'm giving her money
[32:12] and getting changed she's got coveted
[32:14] that's just the first thing in my mind i
[32:16] thought well i'm not going to worry
[32:17] about it
[32:18] and i thought you know she doesn't feel
[32:19] good and
[32:21] as soon as i pulled up
[32:23] someone said what's wrong with you
[32:25] you back up
[32:27] and you ask her
[32:29] if you can pray for her
[32:32] and that sermon come in my mind brother
[32:34] brad and i said
[32:35] there's nobody behind me i backed up
[32:37] trailer and all i backed up and she said
[32:38] what's wrong
[32:39] and i said i want to ask you something i
[32:41] said you said you don't feel good do you
[32:43] she said no i don't
[32:47] and i said
[32:49] well i just felt on my heart that i
[32:51] heard to pray for you
[32:53] and she said no
[32:55] i said well let me have your hand i want
[32:56] to
[32:57] lay hands on you and pray for you
[33:00] and the whole time in my mind my brain's
[33:02] saying you don't need to be doing this
[33:04] but i thought you know
[33:06] if he's in me
[33:08] there's nothing on her that's going to
[33:09] bother me
[33:11] because greater is he that's
[33:13] in me that he that's in the world and i
[33:16] began to pray for her and i left she
[33:18] said you have a blessed day
[33:20] and i thought you know that i could
[33:21] yield and and take heed of what had been
[33:24] said
[33:25] and to feel what someone felt not just
[33:27] because of me i could basically went on
[33:29] down the road and prayed for when i
[33:31] wrote that's not what god wanted
[33:33] because see i had to get out of my
[33:35] comfort zone
[33:37] to ask her if i could pray for her
[33:39] because i don't know her i wouldn't know
[33:40] if i met her today i don't even think
[33:42] i'd recognize her
[33:44] but god wants us to get out of her
[33:46] comfort zone and be a ministry to him
[33:49] not just for the brad and brother thomas
[33:50] and brother daniel but all of us this
[33:52] morning come ahead brother steve

[44:27] beautiful it is
[44:28] amen to be in harmony even especially
[44:31] with god

[44:40] going to talk about disharmony
[44:43] disharmony amen
[44:45] amen and so
[44:47] may the lord help us in that right i
[44:49] mean y'all pray for me
[44:51] amen god bless you let's bow our heads
[44:52] before we open the bible lord jesus we
[44:54] come before you
[44:56] thank the lord jesus to be able to
[44:57] assemble ourselves together in your name
[44:59] lord jesus and having the
[45:01] reactionality in our hearts of what you
[45:04] said when you said
[45:06] that wherever two or three are gathered
[45:08] there you will be in our midst lord and
[45:10] we truly believe god that you are in our
[45:13] midst lord jesus we feel you lord in our
[45:15] heart and we know that you're here lord
[45:17] jesus because you've always proven
[45:19] it to us lord and we ask god that you'll
[45:21] just help me lord get out of the way
[45:22] that you might use your gift to speak to
[45:24] your people may we go from here better
[45:26] people to serve you lord jesus and we
[45:29] for all the health and the blessings and
[45:31] everything that you bestow upon us lord
[45:33] we can't even begin underneath them all
[45:35] but lord this morning as we look at this
[45:36] thought of this harmony and what it's
[45:38] all about lord we ask god you just help
[45:40] me lord and as i read your word father
[45:43] give us the concept of it lord jesus
[45:45] speak to our hearts this morning in
[45:47] jesus name amen and amen
[45:51] turn to bibles and i'm going to go to
[45:53] the one scripture first of all i have
[45:55] quite a few scriptures so i'm going to
[45:57] do a little bit of reading here first
[45:59] let's go to matthew if you will
[46:02] amen
[46:04] matthew the 10th chapter
[46:07] and i want to begin with the help of the
[46:09] lord after i read the description we
[46:10] want to go over
[46:12] and we want to talk about the purpose of
[46:14] god amen because we spoke wednesday
[46:15] night about the will of god amen and how
[46:18] did those that are in the bride of
[46:19] christ the people of god the children of
[46:22] god they only want to do the will of god
[46:25] amen
[46:26] and god has a purpose god has a will
[46:28] amen there's something that god wants i
[46:30] mean that's what we desire whatever god
[46:32] wants and to understand his purpose
[46:35] amen
[46:36] in his ways and the ways of god in every
[46:39] aspect so chapter 10 of matthew
[46:42] will begin with verse 32 amen
[46:46] whosoever
[46:48] 10 32 whosoever therefore shall confess
[46:51] me before men him will i confess also
[46:54] before my father which is in heaven but
[46:56] whosoever shall deny me before man him
[46:58] will i also deny before my father which
[47:01] is in heaven amen think not that i am
[47:04] come to send peace now how many knows
[47:06] there another place he says my peace i
[47:08] give unto you not as the world giveth
[47:10] divine to you amen how many know is it
[47:12] god god does give us peace
[47:15] every real christian has peace in his
[47:18] heart but i want to ask you a question
[47:20] right off the bat are you ready
[47:21] everybody
[47:22] awake do you have peace around you
[47:27] is there peace all around you it's a
[47:30] very tricky question
[47:33] huh
[47:35] is there peace everywhere
[47:37] it sounded like peace on the news last
[47:39] night
[47:40] does that sound like peace
[47:42] no no let me tell you something there's
[47:44] not going to be any peace around you
[47:48] no no no
[47:50] the only
[47:51] peace that you're gonna have
[47:53] is down in here this is the real peace
[47:56] down in here but the external and out
[47:58] there that's the world
[47:59] you're still in the world where there is
[48:01] no peace there's no peace for the wicked
[48:03] saith the lord and you're going to have
[48:05] be all around the wicked as long as
[48:07] you're here on earth the only place he's
[48:09] going to have peace around you is in
[48:11] heaven amen we're not there yet
[48:13] amen now notice here how that jesus does
[48:16] give us peace but think about this how
[48:19] did he also
[48:20] came to do something besides listen what
[48:22] he says think not that i have come to
[48:24] send peace on earth amen
[48:27] i am not condescend peace by the sword
[48:33] ma
[48:34] that's quite something
[48:36] for him to declare that he didn't come
[48:38] to send peace but a sword and i like
[48:40] this sword and what he brings it to
[48:42] because
[48:43] he says i am come to set a
[48:46] man at variance i like that amen at
[48:51] variance in other words there's going to
[48:52] be a little friction there's going to be
[48:54] a difference a variation
[48:58] are you with me
[49:00] against his father
[49:03] and daughter against her mother and
[49:05] daughter-in-law against her
[49:07] mother-in-law now do you reckon that
[49:08] this
[49:09] applies to believers
[49:16] not supposed to
[49:17] no no no no the bodies to be unified
[49:20] you'd be you this this
[49:22] just comes to me can i speak speak to
[49:24] here listen to this
[49:27] if i can quickly find in colossians here
[49:31] you know for us it's like this therefore
[49:34] i beseech you this is in ephesians 4 i
[49:36] therefore the prisoner of the lord
[49:38] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[49:39] vocation wherewith you are called with
[49:42] all loneliness and meekness and
[49:44] long-suffering forbearing one another in
[49:47] love putting up with each other
[49:49] endeavoring to
[49:51] keep the unity of the
[49:54] spirit in the bond of peace because
[49:56] there is one body
[49:59] amen
[50:00] there is one spirit
[50:02] go ahead
[50:04] i'm waiting
[50:05] amen how many know we're all baptized
[50:07] into one body by one spirit
[50:11] variance comes when you don't have the
[50:13] same spirit as somebody else
[50:16] you don't have the same goals as
[50:17] somebody else you don't have the same
[50:19] thought as somebody else
[50:22] all right
[50:23] one uh hope of your calling
[50:26] one lord amen we ain't gotta fuss about
[50:30] heaven and two three different gods no
[50:31] one lord we have one faith we have one
[50:35] baptism we have one god and father of
[50:37] all who is above all and through all and
[50:39] in you all amen back to our scripture
[50:42] over here
[50:43] all right
[50:48] come to say that variance his father
[50:50] and daughter
[50:53] shall be they out of his own household
[50:59] wow
[51:01] he that loveth and father mother more
[51:03] than me is not worthy of me or he that
[51:05] love a son or daughter more than he is
[51:07] not worthy of me and he that taketh not
[51:08] of his cause
[51:11] and followed after me is not worthy of
[51:14] me he had findeth his life shall lose it
[51:16] and who that loses his life for my sake
[51:18] shall find it
[51:19] amen may god add his blessing to the
[51:21] reading of the word you can be seated
[51:24] oh praise the lord disharmony when i got
[51:26] to thinking about this harmony i got to
[51:28] thinking about a lot of words that go
[51:30] along with this harmony amen
[51:33] like adversity
[51:35] and now first of all some this harmony
[51:38] is something that is not working
[51:40] together
[51:43] it doesn't have the same purpose
[51:46] therefore it doesn't have the same goal
[51:49] because your purpose is usually your
[51:51] goal
[51:52] how many there's a purpose there's a
[51:54] purpose while we're here this morning
[51:56] there's a an achievement we're trying to
[51:58] achieve and that's heaven
[52:01] amen
[52:03] oh my
[52:05] well let me just slow down and go to

[52:44] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[52:46] places in christ let me put this down a
[52:49] little bit
[52:50] according as he has chosen us in him
[52:53] before the foundation of the world that
[52:55] we should be holy and without blame
[52:58] before him in love
[53:01] having predestinated us unto the
[53:03] adoption of children by jesus christ

[55:31] us the mystery of his will
[55:34] according to his good pleasure which he
[55:36] has purposed in himself
[55:39] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[55:41] of times he's going to gather together
[55:44] in one all things that are in christ
[55:48] praise god both which are in heaven and
[55:51] which are in earth now how many knows
[55:52] he's going to gather all that is in
[55:55] christ to himself in the rapture we're
[55:57] going to go to heaven and be with christ
[56:00] but the bible also talks about it he's
[56:02] also going to do a bunch of binding
[56:04] and a bunch of bundling together of what
[56:08] the tares
[56:10] they're also going to be gathered in one
[56:13] isn't that right
[56:15] but what's it gonna be for for the fire
[56:18] for the burning
[56:21] amen
[56:22] how many knows there's a fire coming
[56:25] heaven shall be on fire everything on
[56:27] earth is gonna be completely burned just
[56:29] as sure as there was water that flooded
[56:31] the earth the whole earth is going to be
[56:34] burned
[56:36] amen
[56:38] second peter 3
[56:40] amen there won't be anything left is it
[56:42] going to burn
[56:44] amen the elements shall melt with
[56:46] fervent heat the bible says
[56:48] and it's right around the corner
[56:50] not notice
[56:52] so it says both in heaven which are on
[56:53] earth and so forth but listen i like
[56:55] that according to his purpose he has
[56:57] made known to us the mystery of what his
[57:01] will
[57:02] is
[57:03] in ephesians the third chapter
[57:05] and i believe it's in
[57:08] if you want to follow me chapter 3
[57:10] ephesians verse 8.
[57:12] and he's talking about how that god had
[57:14] called paul and struck him down the road
[57:16] to damascus and made him a minister
[57:18] right
[57:20] to the gentiles amen
[57:22] which in other ages in verse 5 says was
[57:25] not made known unto the sons of men and
[57:27] it is as it is now revealed unto his
[57:30] holy apostles and prophets by the spirit
[57:33] now that's how the whole mystery has
[57:34] been made known
[57:36] why god created the earth why are you
[57:38] hung assad why you on the moon why you
[57:40] made the animals why he made the earth
[57:41] why he made everything that he did that
[57:44] mystery has been made known you can now
[57:46] know the full purpose you can know the
[57:49] full plan of god
[57:52] one place i believe it says that we have
[57:53] made known unto us the manifold wisdom
[57:55] of god manifold wisdom
[57:58] it may be in here let's see
[58:01] verse 8 unto me who am less than the
[58:03] least of all saints is this grace given
[58:06] that i should preach among the gentiles
[58:09] the unsearchable riches
[58:11] of christ
[58:13] and to make all men he
[58:16] really like for all men to see this
[58:19] everybody should see it
[58:21] nate no person in the world but
[58:22] shouldn't see what paul was trying to
[58:24] say to make all men see what is the
[58:26] fellowship of the mystery what's it all
[58:29] about
[58:31] oh my
[58:33] you don't have that question do you i
[58:35] don't have that question but there's
[58:36] billions out there that have that
[58:38] question
[58:38] what's it all about
[58:42] what's the whole plan for
[58:45] because don't get me wrong
[58:47] god knew that be just like this he knew
[58:49] everything about him
[58:51] he knew that down through the dark ages
[58:53] from the time of christ till the 1500s
[58:56] you know 68 million christians would
[58:58] give their lives be thrown in the lions
[59:00] then be crucified by the droves
[59:03] be killed with the sword
[59:05] but even jesus says you know be faithful
[59:07] unto death and i will give you a crown
[59:08] of life
[59:10] having a sword stuck through your heart
[59:12] having your head chopped off it's not
[59:13] that big a deal
[59:15] all right
[59:16] oh yeah it seems like it but no after
[59:18] that you're going to live throughout
[59:20] this further than the sun and the moon
[59:21] any any of them ever eternity
[59:25] amen the persecution the trials the
[59:27] hardships the things that you suffer
[59:29] paul said is not to be compared
[59:32] with the things that's going to be given
[59:34] you for what you suffer for christ
[59:38] folks i'm here to tell you it's going to
[59:39] be a little different
[59:40] because this is the same message that's
[59:42] over but just a new angle is that okay
[59:44] this morning
[59:45] it's gonna be a little different
[59:50] amen
[59:51] they don't unders people don't
[59:53] understand the purpose of god they don't
[59:55] understand his ways
[59:59] they don't understand his plan
[1:00:01] isn't that right
[1:00:05] and that's why they are in the shape
[1:00:07] that they're in
[1:00:09] i believe that it was
[1:00:11] paul had said in hebrews about israel
[1:00:14] and how they could never get it
[1:00:18] they could never get it
[1:00:21] they kept disbelieving now the worst
[1:00:23] thing that you can have is unbelief in
[1:00:25] the word of god
[1:00:27] unbelief
[1:00:28] and they kept this believing they kept
[1:00:30] commemorating they kept complaining
[1:00:32] god would bring a mighty hand and bring
[1:00:34] them out of egypt and plagues and
[1:00:36] everything that happened and water
[1:00:38] turned into blood fleas jumping in the
[1:00:41] the king's bed chamber and under his
[1:00:43] sheets and biting him in the legs and
[1:00:45] biting him all over and he just sweet i
[1:00:47] don't know but he'd drive me crazy
[1:00:49] we drove him crazy i'll tell you what he
[1:00:50] said just go just go god did these
[1:00:53] miracles amen and they went out
[1:00:55] rejoicing
[1:00:57] and god took them all the way to the red
[1:00:59] sea and brought them to a dead end
[1:01:02] and then they what opened their mouth
[1:01:04] and didn't believe god
[1:01:05] did wasn't there enough graves in egypt
[1:01:08] we had it better back then and they said
[1:01:10] together where where's the gods now that
[1:01:12] he delivered you out of egypt and so
[1:01:14] forth and did all these miracles he's
[1:01:15] still here he's still with you
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:20] and why did they not enter into the
[1:01:22] kingdom why did they not jesus even set
[1:01:24] their everyone dead why did they all
[1:01:25] perish because they didn't understand
[1:01:28] something why
[1:01:29] will this world perish and everybody in
[1:01:32] it that doesn't believe in christ
[1:01:34] because they don't understand
[1:01:36] they never get it
[1:01:39] and mostly because they refuse to
[1:01:40] believe
[1:01:42] because your whole world your whole
[1:01:43] world
[1:01:44] is created by the things that you
[1:01:46] believe and accept
[1:01:47] let me tell you this what we're fighting
[1:01:49] for is simple little ideas
[1:01:54] like uh people are fighting for the
[1:01:56] right to have a choice you know
[1:01:59] to have a choose choose whether they
[1:02:01] want what they want to do with their
[1:02:02] body
[1:02:04] well i have some news for them maybe
[1:02:07] that's not just their body anymore that
[1:02:08] that's little one's body
[1:02:11] huh
[1:02:12] and they're throwing a big fuss but
[1:02:14] can't take because they can't spill
[1:02:16] blood
[1:02:17] brains and guts and everything else and
[1:02:19] kill all these big people having a fit
[1:02:21] let me tell you something what that is
[1:02:23] that is that is uh a medieval that is
[1:02:26] just evil
[1:02:29] pure and simple evil i don't care what
[1:02:30] you say
[1:02:32] people are having a fit because they
[1:02:33] can't kill little unborn babies
[1:02:40] not right in their mind they're medieval
[1:02:43] amen and then you wonder why they have
[1:02:45] their teenage kids and going to school
[1:02:47] and killing everybody well mama killed
[1:02:49] her baby
[1:02:50] that they can kill all them
[1:02:52] they got a right to do that i cannot
[1:02:54] have a right to do whatever i want kill
[1:02:56] anybody i won't they got a right to kill
[1:02:59] you see the philosophy
[1:03:01] they don't understand
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:04] but what i'm saying is and the other
[1:03:06] idea is that hey you know they have a
[1:03:08] right
[1:03:09] both of them claim to have rights
[1:03:11] you know but it's an idea it's just a
[1:03:13] little it's a difference isn't it it's
[1:03:16] adversity
[1:03:18] it's disharmony
[1:03:19] because they don't have the same idea
[1:03:22] let me tell you something as soon as you
[1:03:24] get a different idea than somebody else
[1:03:26] while there's not going to be harmony in
[1:03:27] there
[1:03:28] that's why paul was saying you know
[1:03:30] you're one body one faith one lord one
[1:03:32] baptism one in god and father of all who
[1:03:35] is in all and through all that's how
[1:03:37] it's supposed to be supposed to be
[1:03:39] harmony supposed to be one
[1:03:41] america is supposed to be one
[1:03:44] you know i'm thinking the other day i
[1:03:45] said man how can you make can you
[1:03:47] imagine running any kind of a government
[1:03:49] with a putin
[1:03:51] huh
[1:03:57] oh my
[1:03:58] ungodly heathen nation don't believe in
[1:04:02] god
[1:04:03] you do something they don't like we're
[1:04:04] going out behind that witch head and
[1:04:06] you're going to disappear and we're
[1:04:07] never going to see you again that's that
[1:04:08] justice
[1:04:10] huh
[1:04:14] my thought is that man ain't no kingdom
[1:04:17] ever was fit to rule or reign or
[1:04:19] anything unless he was a christian
[1:04:22] we did our very best we had the best
[1:04:23] nation on the earth when christian men
[1:04:25] ran it
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:28] we were founded upon christianity
[1:04:30] huh
[1:04:31] on our on our dollar even god we trust
[1:04:35] can you imagine all the eighth can you
[1:04:36] all the americans that hate that thing
[1:04:38] they hate that oh i got oh i hate that
[1:04:41] thing
[1:04:41] huh they do
[1:04:44] yeah you wait till the tribulation
[1:04:46] period until they come after the
[1:04:47] christian
[1:04:48] the conservatives and those that call
[1:04:50] themselves christians because they're
[1:04:51] already saying they need to die
[1:04:53] hello
[1:04:54] everything's coming to a head people
[1:04:56] people are gonna become as bad as they
[1:04:58] can become
[1:04:59] coming to a headstone same with the
[1:05:01] bride of christ coming to a head
[1:05:03] all right
[1:05:05] so now notice over in israel notice how
[1:05:07] that they tempted listen he says listen
[1:05:11] he was talking about them hard not your
[1:05:13] hearts as in the provocation in the day
[1:05:15] of temptation in the wilderness when
[1:05:17] your fathers tempted me proved me and
[1:05:19] saw my mighty works 40 years
[1:05:31] they saw my mighty works for 40 years do
[1:05:34] you realize
[1:05:35] malachi 4 says behold i'll send you
[1:05:37] elijah the prophet before the great and
[1:05:38] dreadful day of the lord he'll turn the
[1:05:40] hearts of children back to the father he
[1:05:42] will send us elijah before the great and
[1:05:44] dreadful day of the lord
[1:05:46] god didn't have to send elijah jesus
[1:05:48] christ didn't have to come in this
[1:05:49] generation and discern the thoughts in
[1:05:51] the tenth of the heart like he did with
[1:05:52] the woman that dwell millions of times
[1:05:57] the sick were raised the dead were
[1:05:58] raised and all the miracles that he did
[1:06:00] he didn't but he did
[1:06:02] it because of grace
[1:06:05] because of mercy for this world
[1:06:08] i'm telling you right now because
[1:06:10] we are in the condition of it because
[1:06:12] people did not accept it didn't receive
[1:06:14] it they don't want it
[1:06:18] israel they lost they they had to go
[1:06:21] back out uh you know and and uh they
[1:06:24] could never go into the promised land
[1:06:26] god forbid them to
[1:06:28] when your father's tempted me prove me
[1:06:30] somebody works 40 years where if i was
[1:06:32] grieved with that generation and said
[1:06:33] they do always err
[1:06:36] in their hearts and they have not known
[1:06:39] my ways
[1:06:41] how many know it's important to
[1:06:43] understand and to be able to get the
[1:06:45] concept of what god's thinking about
[1:06:48] what is god thinking what was god
[1:06:52] thinking
[1:06:54] amen how is his ways what is he like
[1:06:57] what does he like to do what does he do
[1:07:02] amen
[1:07:05] praise be to god
[1:07:09] why are we
[1:07:11] in the place that we are now this is a
[1:07:15] it's really a global message
[1:07:18] really
[1:07:19] when you think about it
[1:07:21] what is what's in god's mind
[1:07:25] why did it allow humanity to fall adam
[1:07:29] and eve to fall he allowed that to
[1:07:31] happen
[1:07:32] or if he wouldn't want it to happen he
[1:07:34] wouldn't let it happen it'll never
[1:07:35] happen
[1:07:38] isn't that right
[1:07:39] now i was driving down the road the
[1:07:41] other day and this is where it began to
[1:07:43] multiply my mind i began to think of
[1:07:45] them what if we'd never fail
[1:07:50] how many know we'd have been in perfect
[1:07:51] harmony the whole time
[1:07:54] there would have never been any
[1:07:55] disharmony
[1:07:58] it would be perfect
[1:07:59] a garden of eden the lions and the oh my
[1:08:03] they not ripped nobody apart
[1:08:06] you can cuddle up to him and oh does
[1:08:08] everybody everybody everyone was
[1:08:10] everything was perfect they didn't know
[1:08:12] any wrong they didn't know anything they
[1:08:14] didn't have any opposition so to speak
[1:08:18] but he allowed him to fall
[1:08:20] and when man fell
[1:08:23] he became self-destructive
[1:08:26] i know his man destroys himself most of
[1:08:28] the time
[1:08:30] no we never no no no no no humanity does
[1:08:34] not learn from history
[1:08:36] we're repeating it right now
[1:08:40] humanity is repeating it exactly like
[1:08:42] they did in the days of noah man's mind
[1:08:45] is what's continually evil
[1:08:49] all the imagination of man's heart was
[1:08:51] continuously and that's how it's become
[1:08:55] wrong it's become right right it's
[1:08:57] become wrong
[1:09:00] they're going backwards just like the
[1:09:02] prophet said it
[1:09:03] it flips so to speak goes right back
[1:09:05] amen we become a bunch of heathens again
[1:09:07] with nose rings and earrings and tattoos
[1:09:10] and everything else
[1:09:12] going right back to heathen and after
[1:09:13] being christians
[1:09:15] a christian
[1:09:18] nation always going back and we're
[1:09:21] heading back to destruction again
[1:09:23] going back to being destroyed again god
[1:09:26] will have to destroy he will destroy it
[1:09:28] because man corrupted himself
[1:09:32] i mean that's what's happening man he's
[1:09:33] corrupting himself
[1:09:37] and then i began to think
[1:09:40] i began to wonder i thought you know
[1:09:42] in the midst of all of that god has a
[1:09:46] plan god makes a way for man
[1:09:51] 100
[1:09:53] god makes a way for a man not to be
[1:09:55] destructive not to be wrong not to be
[1:09:58] sinful but to have a relationship with
[1:10:00] god
[1:10:02] and he allowed that to show you that we
[1:10:04] are empty we were born in sin shaken in
[1:10:06] anybody come into this world speaking
[1:10:08] lies and jesus says you must be born
[1:10:11] again
[1:10:13] you can never be a christian unless you
[1:10:16] do like jesus said unless you're willing
[1:10:17] to take your cross and follow on me and
[1:10:20] hate your own life also if you're not
[1:10:22] willing to die to yourself you cannot be
[1:10:24] my disciple
[1:10:26] unless a man is born again he cannot
[1:10:29] enter into the kingdom of you've got to
[1:10:30] have a new birth and that is the holy
[1:10:33] spirit coming into your life
[1:10:36] are you with me
[1:10:38] god has to come in there and the reason
[1:10:40] that man goes the way that he does he's
[1:10:42] just born to it's like in his genetics i
[1:10:45] thought man it's in man's genetics to
[1:10:47] fall it's a man's genetics to go the
[1:10:49] wrong way to corrupt himself to get
[1:10:52] worse all the time
[1:10:55] it's in his
[1:10:56] makeup but most of all it's in his
[1:11:00] nature
[1:11:02] you can't fight your nature
[1:11:04] huh
[1:11:06] you know how hard it is to quit smoking
[1:11:07] cigarettes
[1:11:09] and nicotine didn't get on you and you
[1:11:11] just can't hardly let them go it's a
[1:11:13] tough battle
[1:11:15] it's very strong and outside of the holy
[1:11:17] spirit
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:20] and it takes because listen the one
[1:11:22] thing i want to emphasize this morning
[1:11:24] is that god knew that we would be in
[1:11:26] that champ he allowed us to get in that
[1:11:28] shape but like paul said he says the
[1:11:30] first adam took us into death but the
[1:11:33] second adam picked us up out of that
[1:11:36] he created and brought a second atom so
[1:11:38] we can get out of that if you chose to
[1:11:43] i hear some amen
[1:11:45] because you're glad to be out of that
[1:11:49] and like i said wednesday talking about
[1:11:51] god amen that he uh all things work
[1:11:53] together for good to them that are
[1:11:54] called according to his purpose right
[1:11:57] those that are called according to his
[1:11:59] purpose and don't move he pressed that
[1:12:01] predestinates he predestinated to be
[1:12:03] conformed to the image of his son
[1:12:06] his real purpose was to have men and
[1:12:09] women he wants
[1:12:11] sons and daughters like himself that's
[1:12:14] his objective
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:22] that's his objective and that's what the
[1:12:24] whole plan of calvary wants
[1:12:26] to pay the price for mankind oh and god
[1:12:28] was so generous that he didn't just
[1:12:30] ration it to certain ones but he said
[1:12:32] whosoever will let him come
[1:12:36] whosoever will let him come
[1:12:39] amen
[1:12:40] but knowing who would and who wouldn't
[1:12:45] praise be to god you love him
[1:12:49] can we go a little longer this morning
[1:12:51] well we ain't even passed time yet so we
[1:12:53] ain't got nothing to worry about
[1:12:59] i like that
[1:13:00] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:13:04] before
[1:13:05] the foundation of the world
[1:13:07] how many knows god knew everything
[1:13:09] before it ever happened
[1:13:11] he knew all things he knew who would
[1:13:12] want to and who wouldn't
[1:13:15] amen
[1:13:17] folks when i think about having been out
[1:13:18] there at 18 19 year old loving ac dc van
[1:13:22] halen and rock and roll and pot and
[1:13:24] everything else
[1:13:26] huh then i think about there was
[1:13:28] something down on the inside of my heart
[1:13:30] said there's got to be something more to
[1:13:32] life than this
[1:13:35] and god to begin to call down there and
[1:13:37] says you know there's a greater calling
[1:13:38] than this there's got to be more
[1:13:41] and i got the hunger and i got the
[1:13:42] thirst after righteousness
[1:13:45] because the bible says you are blessed
[1:13:46] if you have a hunger you are blessed if
[1:13:49] you desire god because so many people
[1:13:50] don't even have to desire
[1:13:53] that's the saddest thing that ever could
[1:13:54] happen to a person from that i have no
[1:13:56] desire for god
[1:13:58] and i'm guarantee you what if he knew
[1:14:00] you before the foundation of the world
[1:14:03] there's gonna be something down there
[1:14:05] there's gonna be something down there
[1:14:07] that pulls you
[1:14:10] jesus said it this way he said all the
[1:14:12] father has given me
[1:14:14] will
[1:14:16] it just say under your seats
[1:14:19] all that he has given will
[1:14:21] will come to me
[1:14:25] and i will lose or not i will cast them
[1:14:27] out i will lose none of them
[1:14:32] oh in the midst of adversity in the
[1:14:34] midst of discord
[1:14:37] huh because how many knows that's what
[1:14:38] the devil brings he brings discord
[1:14:47] amen
[1:14:49] you want to see the beginning
[1:14:51] of disharmony
[1:14:53] let's read the scripture on the
[1:14:55] beginning the creation
[1:14:58] of disharmony
[1:15:02] the devil was in heaven right
[1:15:05] the devil at one time was god's right
[1:15:07] hand
[1:15:08] man
[1:15:10] but something came into his heart
[1:15:13] and then he says how are thou fallen
[1:15:15] from heaven
[1:15:16] oh lucifer son of the morning
[1:15:18] how are thou cut down to the ground
[1:15:21] which did streak in the nations for are
[1:15:23] we becoming weak we're becoming really
[1:15:26] weak
[1:15:27] a nation divided itself cannot stand
[1:15:30] what do you reckon won't happen
[1:15:32] we're so divided
[1:15:37] lying politicians will run saying we're
[1:15:40] going to bring unity we're going to
[1:15:42] bring everybody do they not even a
[1:15:44] little bit
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:48] and i can't blame them
[1:15:50] folks
[1:15:51] i'd be i'd be i wouldn't be unified with
[1:15:53] the wrong thing either i'd be kind of
[1:15:55] politicians that stood for what you
[1:15:56] believed
[1:15:58] stand for what's right
[1:16:00] not just give in to every other thing
[1:16:03] amen
[1:16:04] anyway listen
[1:16:06] which that's weak in the nations for
[1:16:08] thou i set in thine heart i will ascend
[1:16:11] into heaven i will exalt my throne above
[1:16:14] the stars of god i will sit upon the
[1:16:16] mount of the congregation on the sides
[1:16:18] of the north i will ascend above the
[1:16:20] height of the cloud i will be like the
[1:16:24] most high
[1:16:27] in other words i'm going to be like god
[1:16:29] people are going to worship me
[1:16:32] isn't that exactly what hollywood stars
[1:16:34] do
[1:16:35] basketball football stars to musicians
[1:16:38] and everybody else they love for people
[1:16:39] to worship them
[1:16:43] amen
[1:16:45] and it's all comes from the devil the
[1:16:46] devil wants you to worship him and all
[1:16:48] you got to do is take his idea
[1:16:50] i mean that's all you got to do is take
[1:16:52] his will
[1:16:54] do what he wants you to do that's why
[1:16:56] the dark ages they just wanted you to
[1:16:58] acknowledge just kiss the cross just
[1:17:00] tell just do what we tell you to do and
[1:17:02] we'll let you live
[1:17:04] they want you to submit to their will
[1:17:07] that's what the devil wants you to do
[1:17:08] this morning submit to his will
[1:17:11] and he's got you
[1:17:13] but not the bride of christ we will not
[1:17:15] submit to their his will
[1:17:20] amen
[1:17:21] that's where it started that's where the
[1:17:23] dissension came that's where amen that
[1:17:26] disharmony began
[1:17:28] and what happened there was war in
[1:17:30] heaven there was a battle in heaven
[1:17:34] amen that was a great big split in
[1:17:36] heaven
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:41] god cast them out
[1:17:44] he says there's no unity here
[1:17:46] i believe in you
[1:17:48] in order of unity you have to have the
[1:17:50] same idea
[1:17:52] one faith how many know is that
[1:17:54] a church has to have the same
[1:17:57] the same goal
[1:18:00] amen
[1:18:02] and there was that was where the first
[1:18:03] one came along
[1:18:05] how many knows the second one was found
[1:18:07] down in the garden of eden
[1:18:09] when the devil planted in eve's mind
[1:18:13] that god wouldn't really do what he did
[1:18:15] but he'd know that you'd be like god
[1:18:17] knowing good and evil he impregnated her
[1:18:20] he put in her mind the wrong seed
[1:18:23] and she believed
[1:18:24] him oh that's why my my hairs are great
[1:18:29] thanks eve
[1:18:31] that's why i'm getting old when my arms
[1:18:33] and hands are getting all wrinkled
[1:18:35] huh getting more feeble every day
[1:18:38] thanks eve she did it
[1:18:41] that's why
[1:18:42] paul says she's not allowed back here
[1:18:45] i forbid a woman to speak
[1:18:47] she has a question asked her husband at
[1:18:49] home she's the weaker vessel she can be
[1:18:51] deceived much
[1:18:52] easier she was deceived adam knew what
[1:18:56] he was doing
[1:18:57] he was going out and for her sake to
[1:19:00] save her he knew better
[1:19:02] amen
[1:19:05] oh my
[1:19:07] praise be to god
[1:19:10] so you think about that that's where the
[1:19:12] second major one was where he brought in
[1:19:14] and and there was oh my think about it
[1:19:20] when when when david could kill goliath
[1:19:23] he could kill bears and everything else
[1:19:26] but the devil put that lust in his mind
[1:19:28] for beth sheba
[1:19:30] isn't that right
[1:19:33] now let me tell you something i will
[1:19:34] talk a little bit about two kinds of uh
[1:19:37] disharmonies god will bring disharmony
[1:19:39] in your life
[1:19:41] actually you bring it upon yourself
[1:19:42] there's one kind that you bring it upon
[1:19:44] yourself david brought this harmony he
[1:19:46] brought chaos he brought the whole
[1:19:48] nation was in turmoil for years
[1:19:52] many soldiers died fighting absalom and
[1:19:54] different things that happened and all
[1:19:56] kinds of all kinds of things happened
[1:19:58] because of what david did the disharmony
[1:20:00] that david brought upon himself
[1:20:03] but then there's other things that god
[1:20:04] allows he's you know i chasing you as
[1:20:07] children how many knows god god allows
[1:20:09] disharmony to come
[1:20:11] just like job he allowed all those
[1:20:13] things to happen to job to try him to
[1:20:15] test him amen
[1:20:18] just as our trials today here all they
[1:20:21] were all allowed by god
[1:20:28] this is all part of the plan
[1:20:32] isn't that a great thing to be able to
[1:20:33] say
[1:20:34] to know that this whole thing is all
[1:20:36] part of the plan
[1:20:38] it is absolutely part of the plan
[1:20:42] and people say well where is god in all
[1:20:44] this
[1:20:45] oh he's there
[1:20:47] they just don't want him
[1:20:49] they kick him out of schools
[1:20:51] now they're all getting shot
[1:20:53] huh they kick him out of our our our
[1:20:56] government buildings our law officers
[1:20:57] the ten commandments they wanted they
[1:20:59] want him out on them they want to say
[1:21:01] where's god at
[1:21:03] let me tell you something god put us on
[1:21:05] free moral agency and if you don't use
[1:21:07] that free moral agency right
[1:21:09] it is chaos
[1:21:14] that's right free moral agency
[1:21:16] you can just about do whatever you want
[1:21:18] it to do right now
[1:21:20] huh
[1:21:22] that's a tremendous tool
[1:21:24] but if you don't submit to god and put
[1:21:26] him in a control tower
[1:21:28] folks you're it's kind of like this let
[1:21:30] me explain this whole thing kind of in a
[1:21:32] simple thing it's like all these
[1:21:34] vehicles that i hear are sitting in lots
[1:21:37] and they can't sell them because there's
[1:21:38] a certain wire harness that they don't
[1:21:40] have just a simple little 25 wire
[1:21:43] harness perhaps
[1:21:45] and it will not run and they can't do
[1:21:47] anything with it until they get that
[1:21:49] wild harness and that's the way it is
[1:21:51] with every human being you're not ready
[1:21:53] to operate you're not ready to run until
[1:21:55] you get harnessed with the holy ghost
[1:21:58] until you get the baptism of the holy
[1:22:00] ghost you're not fit to live until
[1:22:01] you're ready to die you're not fit to
[1:22:03] live until you've got the holy ghost
[1:22:05] without the holy ghost as the prophet
[1:22:07] said you are nothing but a natural brute
[1:22:09] beast you are worse than an animal
[1:22:14] monkey still kill other monkeys because
[1:22:16] they're not part of the tribe but listen
[1:22:17] when they will kill their own that's
[1:22:19] really bad
[1:22:22] you don't even see monkeys going amongst
[1:22:23] each other and just killing their own
[1:22:25] tribe
[1:22:26] huh
[1:22:28] man is a beast without god
[1:22:34] and people think well i'd never do this
[1:22:36] just give it time
[1:22:37] give it the right pressure
[1:22:39] let it meet the right circumstances
[1:22:41] and people can become utterly evil
[1:22:46] let your kids watch the wrong stuff
[1:22:49] in their bedrooms
[1:22:50] play those head blowing games and
[1:22:53] everything else desensitize the blood
[1:22:55] and everything else
[1:22:58] oh my it's all just getting right for it
[1:23:02] you all right this morning
[1:23:03] i hope i'm not too hard but i'm just
[1:23:05] preaching what i feel led to preach i
[1:23:06] hope that's good
[1:23:08] aren't you glad for grace
[1:23:10] i'm so glad for what christ did on
[1:23:12] calvary
[1:23:14] that's part how many knows that's part
[1:23:15] of the plan
[1:23:16] let me say it quick before i don't say
[1:23:18] it but the whole plan of god is that we
[1:23:20] would get saved and that we go into all
[1:23:22] the world and preach the gospel
[1:23:24] tell everybody that jesus loves them
[1:23:27] tell them all that christ died for you
[1:23:30] nancy pelosi christ died for you
[1:23:34] trump god christ died for every life he
[1:23:37] died for everybody
[1:23:40] what are you going to do about it
[1:23:43] christ died for every one of us
[1:23:46] what are you going to do about it
[1:23:50] all right
[1:23:55] jesus said
[1:23:56] if you're ashamed of me
[1:23:59] there's going to come a day where i'm
[1:24:00] going to be ashamed of you
[1:24:02] in other words in the midst of
[1:24:04] opposition
[1:24:06] in the midst of
[1:24:07] uh
[1:24:11] disharmony
[1:24:12] people that don't agree with you
[1:24:15] huh
[1:24:17] it's easy to confess to believe that i
[1:24:18] believe jesus
[1:24:20] but how about confessing unbelievers
[1:24:22] i'm a christian
[1:24:25] you're ashamed to confess christ he'll
[1:24:27] be ashamed to confess you
[1:24:30] now we've heard the phrase
[1:24:33] that life is not a flowery bed of ease
[1:24:37] god doesn't make it a flowery bed of
[1:24:39] ease for his children
[1:24:42] this whole world is not a flowery bed of
[1:24:44] ease it really isn't
[1:24:47] amen

[1:29:06] christian or not
[1:29:08] you could never exercise these things
[1:29:10] you could never love somebody that hates
[1:29:11] you if you didn't have anybody to hate
[1:29:13] you
[1:29:14] let me say this god allowed the devil
[1:29:18] only he who now let us will let until he
[1:29:20] be taken out of the way
[1:29:22] god allows it god allows all his
[1:29:25] adversity
[1:29:26] amen
[1:29:28] he knew this would be the setting for a
[1:29:29] christian
[1:29:32] gift to every man that asked us of the
[1:29:34] thee and him that taketh away thy goods
[1:29:36] asked him not again
[1:29:39] and as you would that men should do to
[1:29:40] you to you also to them
[1:29:44] you what thank have you hello
[1:29:47] notice how you start if you don't have
[1:29:49] disharmony

[1:29:53] if you don't have somebody
[1:29:56] that doesn't love you
[1:29:57] you will not be able to return it
[1:29:59] because listen to this let's just go on
[1:30:01] for sinners also love those that love
[1:30:04] them
[1:30:05] you see philosophy of christ
[1:30:08] what good is it if everybody just always
[1:30:10] loves you
[1:30:12] sure you love those that love you don't
[1:30:14] you
[1:30:15] everybody loves those that love them
[1:30:16] that's easy

[1:30:22] was meant to be
[1:30:23] christianity was not a flower bed it
[1:30:25] never even was meant to be
[1:30:28] and i have a feeling that there's going
[1:30:29] to be a lot more pressure on all of us
[1:30:31] are you ready there's going to be more
[1:30:33] pressure on every last one of us of
[1:30:35] whether we have the life of christ or
[1:30:37] whether we don't
[1:30:39] whether we can do these things and live
[1:30:40] this kind of life
[1:30:42] amen we'll be on greater display
[1:30:45] amen
[1:30:46] you know it's just had a little thought
[1:30:48] and i know it's just business but us

[1:30:51] it's getting to where you can't ship
[1:30:52] them you cannot ship them unless unless
[1:30:54] you have a certain paper and if you do
[1:30:55] you better be under usda
[1:30:58] or they'll find you ten thousand dollars
[1:31:00] and they will come and shut you i know
[1:31:02] somebody that got shut down over a bunch
[1:31:04] of dogs

[1:31:15] closer and closer
[1:31:18] why do you think oh boy here we go
[1:31:20] why do you think the government wants
[1:31:22] their car once their hands on all of our
[1:31:24] cars wanted to bail out all the banks
[1:31:26] why do you think they want to bail out
[1:31:27] all the small businesses and all of it
[1:31:29] they're going to get their hands on
[1:31:30] everything and control
[1:31:32] everything
[1:31:34] you won't buy or sell unless you be a
[1:31:36] puppy or belong to the mark of the beast
[1:31:38] unless you belong to them
[1:31:40] that's what the bible says
[1:31:42] amen
[1:31:44] and if you do good to them they do good
[1:31:46] to you what thank have you wow jesus i
[1:31:49] like being good to know that he says

[1:32:04] oh do you see where i'm going with this
[1:32:08] disharmony god allowed all this

[1:32:13] come in your life to get you to get down
[1:32:15] on your knees and get a little closer to
[1:32:17] god

[1:36:32] of the wicked one the bible says
[1:36:34] children of the wicked one the world's
[1:36:36] full of them and that's why these like

[1:37:08] praise be to god
[1:37:10] all right
[1:37:17] just a couple words and we'll close
[1:37:20] look couple of words one of them is
[1:37:21] resistance
[1:37:24] resistance
[1:37:26] is in other words for
[1:37:27] disharmony
[1:37:29] somebody resists you
[1:37:34] you say something say no i don't agree
[1:37:37] with that
[1:37:39] do you know that's actually really
[1:37:41] really really terrible
[1:37:45] if what you're saying is this here
[1:37:47] not so much your word but you disagree
[1:37:49] with this
[1:37:52] you're going to hell
[1:37:54] you're going to perish
[1:37:58] the life that you have one day will not
[1:38:00] be anymore
[1:38:01] eternal life is this life that you have
[1:38:03] on the inside
[1:38:05] to have ceaseless ages of perfection in
[1:38:07] heaven
[1:38:09] the earth is a place of trial
[1:38:11] the earth is a pace of place of testing
[1:38:15] the earth is a place of proving who you
[1:38:17] are what you are what you'll stand for
[1:38:19] whether you'll stand or whether you'll
[1:38:21] fall
[1:38:22] whether you'll be a dishrag or you'll be
[1:38:24] a son and daughter of god
[1:38:26] amen
[1:38:27] that's what it's all about
[1:38:29] it's about grace
[1:38:31] amazing grace
[1:38:34] christ died for the sins of the whole
[1:38:35] world every sin that ever will be done
[1:38:37] that has been done all been paid for
[1:38:41] huh
[1:38:42] the pardon has been signed but it's not
[1:38:44] a pardon unless it's received as a
[1:38:46] pardon
[1:38:47] and that's the problem is people are not
[1:38:49] receiving it
[1:38:51] that's why the trouble is
[1:38:53] that is
[1:38:55] resistance
[1:38:56] defiance like goliath i defy the armies
[1:39:01] of the living god
[1:39:03] whoa
[1:39:04] none of us likes to be defied
[1:39:07] none of us likes to be resisted against
[1:39:10] how pleasant it is the bible says for
[1:39:12] brothers to dwell together in unity
[1:39:16] jesus christ came to save sinners
[1:39:19] a little louder
[1:39:21] we're all one with that amen
[1:39:24] you speak one thing and you get all
[1:39:26] agreement
[1:39:28] agreement opponent
[1:39:29] praise be to god
[1:39:31] resistance
[1:39:32] defiance
[1:39:34] to differ
[1:39:35] difference
[1:39:37] differences i guess we have differences
[1:39:40] of opinion
[1:39:44] has that ever been all that good for you
[1:39:45] not really
[1:39:47] you can't walk the same path you don't
[1:39:49] agree with each other
[1:39:51] your opinions are different god's
[1:39:53] opinion and god the devil's opinion is
[1:39:56] different
[1:39:59] amen
[1:40:00] they differ that's little word differ
[1:40:03] can be a terrible word
[1:40:05] amen
[1:40:10] dislike
[1:40:12] to dislike
[1:40:14] i wanted to pull it up probably god says
[1:40:16] it's a terrible thing
[1:40:19] for one person to
[1:40:20] dislike another

[1:40:26] you just don't like it at all
[1:40:28] huh

[1:40:56] discord
[1:40:58] amen
[1:40:59] god hates
[1:41:00] discord

[1:44:42] with brother bannon
[1:44:44] the fbi searched it out the only
[1:44:46] supernatural light ever taken and it was
[1:44:48] the pillar of fire god himself
[1:44:51] god himself you say well well you can be
[1:44:54] how many knows you can be critical
[1:44:56] but if that really really is god
[1:45:00] what do you reckon your attitude's going
[1:45:01] to mean it's going to mean a lot if that
[1:45:04] really is god and i believe it is that
[1:45:06] pillar fire over brother baby the only
[1:45:07] picture that would even develop
[1:45:10] amen
[1:45:10] all the others of that critic wouldn't
[1:45:12] even come
[1:45:14] out miracles and signs and wonders to

[1:45:21] taped library back there 1100 tapes of
[1:45:24] jesus discerning thoughts and intensive
[1:45:25] heart miracle after miracle there's no
[1:45:27] excuse for this generation
[1:45:29] they're just not
[1:45:30] america it's just not going to be an
[1:45:32] excuse for
[1:45:34] how many knows it's it's one thing for a
[1:45:37] sinner to just
[1:45:39] you know he can't really turn his back
[1:45:40] on god but when a nation that claim god
[1:45:44] then turns your back on god
[1:45:46] can you imagine the penalty that it's
[1:45:48] going to be
[1:45:52] it's going to be fire folks it's going
[1:45:54] to be hot
[1:45:56] amen
[1:46:00] so i want to close with this thought
[1:46:03] he put it that way he says look
[1:46:05] you confess me before me and i'll
[1:46:07] confess you you're ashamed of me i'll be
[1:46:09] ashamed of you
[1:46:10] he puts it in such a way until you have
[1:46:12] to make a choice
[1:46:13] how many believes you got to make a
[1:46:14] choice
[1:46:15] people don't want to make a choice but
[1:46:16] you have to make a choice who you're
[1:46:18] going to serve because jesus said no man
[1:46:20] can serve two masters he only he'll
[1:46:22] serve the one and hate the other or love
[1:46:23] the one ate the other
[1:46:27] let's stand this evening early afternoon

[1:47:08] if there's anybody that god is tugging
[1:47:10] on your heart you feel something in your
[1:47:12] heart that tells you you should give
[1:47:14] your life to god don't wait do it now

[1:47:43] that we want it to be
[1:47:45] this way that god has already ordained
[1:47:46] it to be
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:49] how many
[1:47:50] inhibitions that need to be a greater
[1:47:52] reflection of christ because that's
[1:47:54] truly his purpose not our businesses and
[1:47:56] everything else but his the business of
[1:47:58] christ is to go into all the world and
[1:48:00] preach the gospel to tell the world of
[1:48:02] what christ did for him
[1:48:04] that there's grace there's salvation
[1:48:07] there's mercy for him
[1:48:09] there's a guide there for him there's a
[1:48:11] holy spirit to lead and guide him give
[1:48:12] him joy and peace in the midst of a very
[1:48:15] unpeaceful world
