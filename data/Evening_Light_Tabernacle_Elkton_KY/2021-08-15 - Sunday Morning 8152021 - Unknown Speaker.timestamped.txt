[0:52] us so whatever you need is this morning
[0:55] what you've come here for whatever your
[0:57] desire

[0:59] i know everyone's pure desire is to know
[1:01] the lord in a better way and in a purer
[1:03] way but just open your hearts and faith
[1:06] and believe he can do something for you
[1:07] today
[1:09] lord we just move upon you lord god
[1:13] desire to see your lord touch the hearts
[1:15] of your people this morning lord
[1:17] that you'll take full control over the
[1:19] service lord you know the needs in the
[1:21] hearts of your people you know their
[1:22] desires lord
[1:24] now just move upon the service lord may
[1:27] we yield yourselves lord to be taught
[1:29] from you lord to open our hearts to you
[1:31] this morning lord
[1:33] be with everybody today i pray lord
[1:35] whatever their situations are lord just
[1:38] touch their lives and touch their hearts
[1:40] we ask and believe this thing lord in
[1:42] your precious name amen and we'll read
[1:45] these
[1:46] like uh brother troy's been doing it
[1:49] i'll start
[1:50] at the 49th first
[1:52] and he goes to say here remember the
[1:53] word unto thy servant upon which thou
[1:56] has caused me to hope
[2:04] the proud have made me greatly in
[2:06] diversion yet i have i not declined from
[2:09] thy law
[2:17] has taken hold upon me because of the
[2:20] wicked that forsake thy law
[2:29] i have remembered thy name o lord in the
[2:31] night
[2:32] and have kept thy law
[2:38] thou art my portion o lord
[2:40] i have said that i would keep thy words
[2:51] i thought on my ways and turned my feet
[2:54] unto thy testimonies
[3:00] the bands of the wicked have robbed me
[3:02] but i have not forgotten thy law
[3:13] thee and of them that keep thy precepts
[3:18] the earth o lord is full of thy mercy
[3:21] teach me thy statutes you can be seated
[3:25] i was just going to reread this one
[3:27] verse
[3:28] a lot of preachers talk about this
[3:31] i know that
[3:33] you know thing about salvation is
[3:36] basically to get started all you've got
[3:37] to realize is you're going the wrong
[3:39] direction and turn around and go the
[3:41] opposite direction and anything in life
[3:43] if you keep running against the wall and
[3:45] it's not working obviously you need to
[3:48] turn around do something different but
[3:49] it says here
[3:53] so i thought on my ways so
[3:55] it lets you know that you have to think
[3:57] on your way sometimes sometimes you can
[3:59] get in a rut or you just put your head
[4:00] down and you just keep going and going
[4:02] and before you know it you're not going
[4:04] nowhere but he says i thought on my ways
[4:06] and turned my feet on to thy testimony
[4:08] so you got to think on your ways and
[4:10] then you got to turn your feet or your
[4:12] life on his testimonies and not what you
[4:15] thought about life or what you think is
[4:17] right but what god's word says is right
[4:20] and you just got to turn in the right
[4:21] direction if you return with me to uh
[4:25] romans the 10th chapter
[4:29] and uh first
[4:30] corinthians
[4:32] the first chapter
[4:35] i was
[4:36] thinking this morning i was just wanting
[4:38] to read this before i get started you
[4:40] know
[4:42] there's a lot to be you know simply to
[4:44] get started on the path we're all on
[4:46] this morning
[4:48] you know first thing that god has to do
[4:50] for you is put that desire in your heart
[4:52] that you want something other than what
[4:54] this life has to order
[4:57] for you you know you have a desire to
[4:59] serve the lord that little kindle of
[5:01] light or that little light that's in
[5:03] your heart that you want to do better
[5:05] and god is trying to speak to you but i
[5:07] was going to read this out of pilgrim's
[5:09] progress
[5:11] this statement here this is
[5:13] this is after vanity fair
[5:17] and this is one hopeful george christian
[5:19] and hopefully explaining the christian
[5:23] what brought about his salvation but
[5:25] i'll just read this statement here and
[5:27] there's a lot of you know i was thinking
[5:29] of these people in the you know in the
[5:31] 16th century this is 400 years ago
[5:33] around this time you know in the about
[5:35] 1620 to 1640 you know that's 400 years
[5:39] ago but like uh brother branham said the
[5:42] truth of god they never changed they're
[5:44] they're constant the formula
[5:46] for us
[5:47] the is the same in any generation if you
[5:51] want to get closer to god and brother
[5:53] branham said pray every day and read
[5:55] your bible and always believe christ so
[5:58] simple principles they don't change
[6:00] their i mean the world might try to
[6:02] educate you out of them but there's
[6:04] pretty simple you know i listen to a lot
[6:07] of ministers you know when i'm driving
[6:09] my truck i'll put on a different
[6:10] christian
[6:11] and
[6:12] they really if you say you always
[6:14] believe what god says no matter what you
[6:16] tell me i'm gonna believe god they'll
[6:18] laugh at you they say well you
[6:20] explain it well that's the first time
[6:22] that's where you really start you don't
[6:24] have to explain anything god's word
[6:25] stands on its own you don't have to
[6:27] prove it to people you just have to
[6:29] present it to people but i'll just read
[6:30] what this statement is if if it's on the
[6:34] 162nd chapter if you have your own copy
[6:37] i don't know if the chapters then pages
[6:40] are gonna match this is in the old
[6:42] english here
[6:43] it goes on this is what hopeful says
[6:45] this is what he prayed god be merciful
[6:48] to me a sinner
[6:51] and make me to know and believe
[6:53] in jesus christ
[6:55] so the first thing
[6:56] i have to do or anyone has to do is
[6:59] accept the fact who you really are and
[7:01] know that in yourself there's nothing
[7:03] sufficient for you to
[7:05] make yourself clean on that day you so
[7:08] the first thing god be merciful to me a
[7:11] sinner and make me to know and believe
[7:13] in jesus christ
[7:15] for i see that if his righteousness had
[7:17] not been or i have not faith in that
[7:20] righteousness i am utterly cast away and
[7:23] it goes back to what brother branham
[7:25] taught to us it's not your own
[7:27] righteousness it's not anything you do
[7:30] or anything that you can do it's
[7:32] everything that god has done for you
[7:34] it's a finished work you just have to
[7:36] have enough faith god's got to give you
[7:38] enough faith
[7:39] everyone has a little bit of faith the
[7:41] apostle said god
[7:43] told jesus increase our faith so they
[7:45] could believe the word that he was
[7:47] telling it's the same for us and he goes
[7:49] on to say
[7:51] in the righteousness i'm utterly cast
[7:53] away lord i have heard that thou art a
[7:55] merciful god and as adorn
[7:58] ordain thy
[7:59] son
[8:00] jesus christ should be the savior of the
[8:02] world and moreover
[8:04] thou art willing to bestow upon such a
[8:06] poor sinner as i am
[8:08] and i am a sinner indeed we're all
[8:10] sinners you know there's nothing perfect
[8:12] about us nothing good about us we're all
[8:14] come from different situations but in
[8:17] the end we're all sinners whether you're
[8:19] rich or poor whether you're big or small
[8:21] it don't make a difference everyone on
[8:23] the face of the earth is the sinner and
[8:25] without god and the grace of god gives
[8:28] them they're they're headed to
[8:29] destruction now you don't hear that too
[8:31] much anymore
[8:33] uh about destruction but that's where
[8:35] we're all headed if we don't accept this
[8:38] am i and i am a sinner indeed lord take
[8:40] there for this opportunity
[8:43] and magnify the grace in the salvation
[8:46] of my soul through thy son jesus
[8:49] christ amen and i was going to go back
[8:52] here to this um
[8:54] 10th chapter here
[8:56] of romans i believe you all know this
[8:59] uh pretty well but i'll start here
[9:03] paul's talking here to the gentiles
[9:06] and i'll start at about uh about the
[9:08] sixth earth but the righteousness which
[9:11] is of faith speak it on this bus
[9:14] say not in thine heart who shall ascend
[9:16] into heaven that is bringing christ down
[9:18] from above or who shall descend
[9:22] into the deep that is to bring up christ
[9:24] again from the dead but what saith the
[9:26] word is nigh
[9:28] thee even in thy mouth that in thy heart
[9:31] that is
[9:32] a word of faith which we preach and
[9:35] that's what goes forth every every
[9:37] service here the word of god and faith
[9:39] you've got to believe in faith
[9:41] the word of god it
[9:43] no one can make you believe in faith
[9:45] that's something god's got to give you
[9:46] that the word becomes
[9:48] preeminent in everything you do in your
[9:50] life and he goes on
[9:54] and he
[9:55] i don't want to reread this i do that a
[9:57] lot i apologize for that thou shalt if
[9:59] thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[10:01] lord jesus and shall believe in thine
[10:03] heart that god has raised him from the
[10:05] dead thou shalt be saved but with the
[10:07] heart man believeth on to righteousness
[10:09] and with the mouth
[10:11] confession is made onto salvation for
[10:13] the scripture saith whosoever believeth
[10:15] on him shall not be ashamed so paul's
[10:18] saying here
[10:20] whatever the world does to you out there
[10:22] there's no you there's nothing to be
[10:24] ashamed of for a christian no matter
[10:26] what they say to you what they do to you
[10:28] how they treat you you should never be
[10:30] ashamed of the fact of what god has done
[10:32] for you
[10:33] in your heart and life they might make
[10:35] fun of you they might walk away from you
[10:37] your family might disown you but you
[10:40] have a better hope a better desire it
[10:42] shouldn't it shouldn't offend it
[10:44] shouldn't offend you and it shouldn't
[10:45] change thee and he goes on say for the
[10:47] scripture saith whoever believeth on him
[10:50] shall not be ashamed for there
[10:54] for there is no difference between the
[10:56] jew and the greek
[10:58] for the same lord over all is rich on on
[11:01] to all that call
[11:03] upon him there's like i said there's no
[11:05] great men or no small one it comes to
[11:07] the grace of salvation it's all a gift
[11:10] that god gives to anyone
[11:12] and uh it goes whosoever shall call upon
[11:14] the name of the lord shall be saved how
[11:16] then shall they call upon him which they
[11:18] have not believed how so they believe on
[11:20] him which they have not heard and how
[11:23] shall they hear without a preacher so
[11:25] it's kind of hard to get away from the
[11:26] fivefold ministry it goes on and how
[11:29] shall they preach except they be sent as
[11:32] it is written how beautiful are the feet
[11:34] of them that preach the gospel
[11:36] of peace bring glad tidings and good
[11:38] things
[11:39] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[11:41] for our elijah said said lord hath
[11:44] lord who hath believed our report that
[11:46] goes back to the 53rd
[11:48] 53rd chapter of isaiah there
[11:51] and so faith cometh by hearing and
[11:54] hearing by the word of god but i say
[11:56] have they not heard yes verily their
[11:59] sound went out into all the earth their
[12:01] words onto the ends of the world
[12:03] for i say did not israel know
[12:06] first moses saith i will provoke you to
[12:08] jealousy
[12:09] by them that are not
[12:11] are no people but and by
[12:14] foolish nations will i anger you and
[12:16] we've already gone for that period
[12:18] already that last 2 000 years on the
[12:21] faith we're at the end now we're at the
[12:22] end
[12:24] of it all
[12:25] right now
[12:27] you know people say that a lot we're at
[12:29] the end of it all am i saying it's going
[12:31] to be tomorrow no am i saying it's going
[12:33] to be 10 days from now no i'm just
[12:35] saying as you see the world falling
[12:37] apart the way it is there's no hope in
[12:39] the world there's no hope in your
[12:41] country there's no hope in your state
[12:42] whatever there's no hope in that if
[12:44] you're counting on any of that you're
[12:45] going to be a miserable person but we're
[12:48] coming to a point where you can't keep
[12:50] going the way it's going
[12:52] excuse me
[12:54] but elias was very bold and saith
[12:56] i was found of them that sought me not
[12:59] and that's us here i was found of them
[13:01] that sought me not i was made manifest
[13:04] onto them that asked not after me
[13:07] but to israel he saith all day long if i
[13:10] stretch forth my hand onto a disobedient
[13:12] and gain saying people that's where we
[13:15] were you know god
[13:17] you know i only can speak for my own
[13:18] life you know when i was a young man you
[13:21] know i don't i'm not from this state
[13:23] you know i was totally happy you know
[13:25] until god got a hold of my heart one day
[13:27] i
[13:28] i was totally happy in my situation
[13:30] until i realized that my situation
[13:32] wasn't a good situation and god had to
[13:34] speak to my heart and life just like all
[13:36] you had to speak
[13:38] your heart and life one day but as i
[13:41] look at this world i i just shake my
[13:43] head sometimes
[13:45] sister gannett knows i'm the last couple
[13:47] days haven't been good days for me
[13:48] because you know you don't spend all
[13:50] those years on active duty and see
[13:52] what's going on with our country right
[13:54] now and you know it doesn't bring you
[13:56] any peace you see what what's being
[13:58] allowed to happen out there on the stage
[14:00] you know i was just thinking yesterday
[14:02] that it's like i'm living in the 1970s
[14:05] again what we see going on in the world
[14:07] and in our government you know it's just
[14:10] like uh 1970s are being relived all over
[14:13] again you know
[14:14] so we have no hope in this world the
[14:17] only hope we have is in jesus christ

[40:04] and
[40:05] share it with the people lord we just
[40:07] ask that you would move on the scene in
[40:08] a special way that you would show your
[40:10] power that you would show your might and
[40:12] your demonstration of what you can do

[40:38] word goes forth that it would sink in
[40:39] deep lord because i feel like lord that
[40:42] we're in a a state in an hour
[40:44] where you're calling your people up
[40:46] higher lord jesus
[40:47] that you've raised the bar you've raised
[40:50] standard and the expectations that we
[40:52] have to have as
[40:53] christians are not what they once were
[40:55] 10 15 20 years ago but it's a higher
[40:58] calling now lord
[40:59] and i pray lord that the people can
[41:01] grasp what we have on our heart this
[41:04] morning lord as we come forth we love
[41:06] you lord we thank you for all you do and
[41:08] we appreciate you in christ's name amen
[41:11] amen
[41:13] if you would turn with me into the book
[41:14] of romans
[41:18] romans chapter 8
[41:20] and we'll look at verse 13.
[41:23] romans chapter 8 and verse 13.
[41:28] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[41:29] this morning and thankful for the rain
[41:31] we got here and i trust if you live away
[41:33] you've got some rain it's sure been dry
[41:35] and hot and it was just not this morning
[41:38] to to go out for a little bit and and
[41:40] just feel some cool air for a change and
[41:43] we're thankful for that
[41:45] how many come expect them this morning
[41:47] good good that's uh that's what we want
[41:50] to talk about is expectations this
[41:52] morning
[41:54] you know
[41:57] there's so many things going on i pre
[41:59] preach it a lot we get called in the
[42:01] trap of it that things change but god
[42:03] don't change
[42:05] uh covet comes to destroy but but god's
[42:07] still a healer
[42:09] um you know struggles come our way but
[42:11] god's still a deliverer
[42:13] you know they try to just continually
[42:15] throw stuff at us you know
[42:17] and and they want you to
[42:20] conform to their way of thinking i say
[42:22] there i'm talking about the world in
[42:24] general
[42:25] but
[42:25] god don't change
[42:28] uh romans chapter 8
[42:32] verse 13
[42:34] for if you live after the flesh you
[42:36] shall die
[42:38] but if ye through the through the spirit
[42:40] do mortify the deeds of the body ye
[42:43] shall live
[42:44] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[42:47] god
[42:48] they are the sons of god
[42:51] for ye have not received the spirit of
[42:53] bondage again to fear aren't you
[42:55] thankful for that
[42:56] but ye have received the spirit of
[42:59] adoption
[43:00] where we cry abba father
[43:04] abba father
[43:07] so this is this means an intimate
[43:09] relationship abba father intimate and a
[43:12] lot of times preachers preach it as i
[43:14] have a father means papa or daddy but
[43:16] there's another side to it that means
[43:18] obedience
[43:20] you're not only in an intimate
[43:21] relationship with abba father but you
[43:24] also have to be in obedience to abba
[43:26] father and the only two people to use
[43:28] this phrase in the bible is jesus and
[43:30] paul
[43:31] have a father
[43:33] the spirit itself
[43:35] beareth witness with our spirit
[43:38] did you catch that the spirit itself
[43:41] beareth witness with our spirit so now
[43:43] we have two spirits that are aligning
[43:45] two spirits that are coming together the
[43:47] deep is now called into the deep
[43:51] the spirit itself bear witness with our
[43:54] spirit that we are the children of god
[43:57] and if children then heirs
[44:01] heirs of god and joint heirs
[44:04] with christ
[44:06] don't you like that joint heirs with
[44:08] christ they you didn't you don't go to
[44:11] the estate reading
[44:12] and find out that this one or this
[44:14] brother or that brother or this brother
[44:16] got got a thousand acres this one got a
[44:18] porsche this one got a lamborghini this
[44:20] one got an airplane and you got stuck
[44:21] with the silverware
[44:24] it don't work that way
[44:26] your joint heirs with christ so
[44:28] everything that christ has from god
[44:30] everything that he is also yours
[44:35] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[44:38] may also be glorified together may god
[44:40] add his blessings to the reading of the
[44:42] word this morning you can be seated
[44:45] matthew chapter 7 and 8 and luke 11 and
[44:47] 10 both read exactly the same and they
[44:50] say for
[44:51] everyone that asketh receiveth and he
[44:54] that seeketh findeth
[44:56] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[44:58] opened
[45:00] so i'll ask you again this morning how
[45:02] many come
[45:03] expecting
[45:06] brother branham says we always get what
[45:08] we expect
[45:10] now i've got quite a bit of quotes i'm
[45:12] going to go through today and by god's
[45:13] grace we're going to preach them and not
[45:15] read them and and so uh pray for us in
[45:18] that area
[45:19] we always get what we expect when people
[45:21] expect anything
[45:23] well then they usually get what they
[45:25] look for it's the mental attitude that
[45:27] you have he said remember this and never
[45:30] forget it he said the right mental
[45:32] attitude towards any promise of god
[45:35] will bring it to pass
[45:37] the right mental attitude towards any
[45:39] promise
[45:40] it doesn't take the gifts of healing to
[45:42] heal sick people
[45:45] here we have the prophet of god who has
[45:46] the gift of healing in his life and he's
[45:49] saying it don't even take that
[45:51] you don't have to be what i am as the
[45:53] prophet of god a
[45:54] gift of healing you don't have to have
[45:57] that to heal the sick it's not amazing
[46:00] he said you don't have to have that any
[46:02] person in here that has he has the right
[46:04] to meet satan anywhere if you're a
[46:07] christian and beat him on any grounds
[46:10] that he could stand on
[46:12] and when jesus was here on the earth and
[46:14] in him dwelled the fullness of the
[46:16] godhead bodily all the great powers of
[46:18] god was in his son christ jesus for the
[46:22] scripture tells us
[46:24] uh that god was a christ reconciling the
[46:26] world to himself that all things was
[46:28] delivered unto him though he spoke
[46:30] nothing but what the father told him and
[46:32] no one was healed but what he first saw
[46:35] being healed
[46:36] verily i say unto you the son can do
[46:38] nothing without in himself but what he
[46:39] sees the father doing listen to this in
[46:43] another one many times brother brown
[46:44] preached expectation numerous times and
[46:46] there's different things he pulled out
[46:48] about expectations and and how we should
[46:50] be
[46:51] expectating what thank god will do
[46:53] and he says but now tonight i want as we
[46:56] gather here to start this prayer meeting
[46:58] praying for the sick believing god for
[47:00] the supernatural
[47:02] i trust that every person in here will
[47:05] take it up on themselves
[47:08] to be under prayer all the time
[47:11] in your homes
[47:14] be fasting and praying
[47:16] and come with great expectations for if
[47:19] you don't expect anything you won't
[47:21] receive anything you'll just receive as
[47:24] you expect
[47:26] so brothers and sisters we've been
[47:27] talking and and i i hope you've been uh
[47:30] if you haven't been here on wednesday
[47:31] nights i hope you've been following
[47:32] along with the ministry as it's been
[47:33] going forth the different ministers
[47:35] coming it's all time together and i hope
[47:37] you can see that that god is not content
[47:39] with us in a place that we're at but
[47:41] he's calling us to a higher place a
[47:44] higher level that would stand up on the
[47:46] word of god and apply the word of god
[47:48] into our lives and find ourselves
[47:51] participating and be the joint heirs
[47:54] with christ
[47:58] expectations
[48:00] a strong belief that something will
[48:03] happen
[48:04] or it'll be the case in the future
[48:06] expectations brothers and sisters are
[48:08] built upon our faith
[48:10] and expectation
[48:12] is something that god honors
[48:15] our faith in
[48:16] that's the expectation
[48:21] so i ask you one more time
[48:23] how many come expecting this morning
[48:28] brothers and sisters have we come to
[48:29] church with a purpose
[48:32] have we uh
[48:34] got our lives lined up to live life with
[48:37] a purpose are we christians on a mission
[48:41] do we have a need this morning a mission
[48:43] a desire in our hearts that in order to
[48:46] come into contact with god
[48:49] let me ask you this do you need a
[48:50] miracle
[48:53] do you need a breakthrough in a
[48:55] situation in your life
[48:59] do you need a word from god sometimes we
[49:02] just need a word from god
[49:04] do you need healing this morning
[49:07] brothers and sisters it's a time
[49:10] to expect great things in christ you
[49:13] know sometimes people come up
[49:16] and they get things going on in their
[49:17] life and the next thing you know they
[49:19] they ask for this and they pray for this
[49:21] and they're just stubborn enough to
[49:23] receive it
[49:25] in their life
[49:27] they're just stubborn enough to receive
[49:29] it
[49:30] whether or not god really wants them to
[49:32] have it but because of their mindset and
[49:33] the way they think they believe and they
[49:36] stand up on the promise that they think
[49:37] in their mind and they have it
[49:40] where does it leave us as
[49:42] christians has been speaking to us over
[49:45] and over and over about becoming one
[49:47] with him and trusting in him and letting
[49:49] him move on the scene in our life
[49:52] so what about it uh the letting the holy
[49:54] spirit take control of our every
[49:55] movements
[49:57] and creating the atmosphere that we want
[49:59] to live in
[50:01] creating the atmosphere you build a
[50:03] world and you go live in it that's the
[50:05] atmosphere you create
[50:07] but here's the thing about it we control
[50:09] it
[50:11] we control it we control uh we control
[50:14] whether we yield to the holy spirit or
[50:16] whether we don't
[50:18] we control uh either we came expecting
[50:21] this morning or we don't
[50:23] let me ask you this question did you
[50:25] come this morning with a dedicated plan
[50:26] to prove god in action
[50:28] did you come this morning to prove god
[50:30] and to call god on the scene are you
[50:32] just here for the food so to speak
[50:35] you know there's a difference
[50:38] you've heard the same people go to a
[50:40] wedding they're not really there uh to
[50:42] participate in the wedding they're not
[50:43] in the wedding party hey i'll see you
[50:45] nice for you to be here i'm just here
[50:46] for the food
[50:48] and that's the way sometimes people come
[50:49] to church
[50:50] they don't come to church with a plan
[50:52] they don't come to church with an action
[50:54] and when you
[50:55] fail to plan your your planning to fail
[50:58] and so they come and they just come for
[51:00] the food the words going forth they take
[51:02] in the work they hear the word all
[51:03] that's nice the preacher is doing good
[51:05] and you know praise god we're out of
[51:07] here they've done their duty for the
[51:09] week
[51:11] but what about coming and saying i'm
[51:13] going to come get something from god
[51:14] today
[51:16] i've got a need in my life i've got a
[51:18] desire that i can't fulfill i've got
[51:20] something that i need god to move on the
[51:22] scene i need a miracle
[51:25] you know you don't know you need a
[51:26] miracle till you need a miracle
[51:28] you don't think about it until it's in
[51:30] your in your court and you have to have
[51:32] a miracle but you come to god with a
[51:34] plan and say i'm going to get something
[51:36] from god that's the difference
[51:38] galatians 4 if you want to follow along
[51:42] now i say that the heir as long as he is
[51:45] a child
[51:46] difference nothing from a servant
[51:50] though he be lord of all
[51:53] but is under tutors and governors
[51:56] until the time appointed of the father
[52:01] even so we
[52:03] when we were children
[52:04] we were in bondage under the elements of
[52:06] this world but when the fullness of time
[52:08] had come
[52:10] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[52:12] made under the law
[52:14] to redeem them that were under the law
[52:16] that they might receive adoptions
[52:20] of sons
[52:21] and because ye are sons god hath sent
[52:24] forth the spirit of his sons unto your
[52:25] heart crying here it is again abba
[52:27] father
[52:29] wherefore thou art no more a servant but
[52:32] a son and if a son than an heir of god
[52:35] through
[52:36] christ
[52:38] brother and sister god is calling us to
[52:40] that higher place this morning
[52:43] we've been under the tutorship
[52:45] of the message of the hour
[52:48] for years
[52:50] we've been under the message of the hour
[52:52] we've been under the tutorship of the
[52:53] prophet
[52:58] for years
[53:00] let's think about it there's people
[53:02] that's been around this message
[53:04] that said in the prophet's meetings
[53:09] they've got kids
[53:11] sitting in the message churches
[53:13] grandkids
[53:15] sitting in message churches
[53:17] great grandkids
[53:19] sitting in message churches
[53:21] some people have great great grandkids
[53:25] setting in message
[53:27] churches
[53:28] so it's not because of the life of not
[53:31] seeing god's greatness we've seen god's
[53:33] greatness we've seen god good in the
[53:35] lives of others and we've seen it in the
[53:37] in the bible in the lives of the prophet
[53:39] but what about
[53:40] you what about me what are we exercising
[53:44] this morning what is god doing in our
[53:46] life
[53:47] what about our personal experience
[53:50] with god
[53:52] you know we listen to the stories that
[53:53] the prophet tells and we see how the
[53:57] prophet
[53:58] calls god on the scene
[54:02] and we see how that god moves on the
[54:05] scene and how god takes over the
[54:07] scenario and the scenes
[54:09] and i'm just going to read a few of
[54:10] these things to you today some of the
[54:12] stories that we've heard since
[54:14] we cut our teeth on the message
[54:16] brotherhood was telling the story
[54:20] and he said
[54:23] you may laugh at this
[54:25] but that'll be between you and god
[54:28] there was a big old male cow down there
[54:31] that had killed a man
[54:32] and they sold him to another farm he
[54:34] said well i was there in the game warden
[54:36] i had to go out and turn fish loose that
[54:38] afternoon and some minnows up in the
[54:40] creek and i had a sick call over the way
[54:42] and i thought well i'll just walk over
[54:43] there and make this sick call
[54:45] and i'll go over there and pray for this
[54:47] person that's sick and then i'll go back
[54:48] to my truck
[54:49] and he said
[54:51] so i got out of my truck and i walked
[54:52] across the field and i'm going over
[54:54] there and there's some little shrubs i
[54:56] never thought about this fella sitting
[54:57] over in the field
[54:59] he never thought about this fella
[55:00] sitting over in the field and he said
[55:02] there you know i was out in the middle
[55:03] of that field maybe 300 yards from the
[55:05] fence and the fence four to five feet
[55:08] high and he said all of a sudden i
[55:10] jumped that big fella and recognized
[55:12] that i was in the field he was in
[55:15] can you imagine walking across that
[55:17] field we've heard this story numerous
[55:18] times but he's walking across this field
[55:21] and a 2 000 pound bull stands up that
[55:23] has already killed a man
[55:25] and he's 300 yards away from any kind of
[55:28] safety and security and he said he
[55:31] raised up there and that big fellow let
[55:33] out a billow like and threw his head
[55:35] down and he said it's the truth he said
[55:37] i knowed he could beat me to the fence
[55:39] and there was nothing to do there but
[55:42] die right in the field
[55:45] the prophet of god is staring death
[55:50] face to face
[55:52] two thousand pound bull
[55:54] and he said he started coming at me
[55:57] and he said but something happened and i
[55:59] wish it would only happen now and stay
[56:01] that way
[56:02] but instead of hating that bull i loved
[56:04] him
[56:09] you mean just loving
[56:12] brother bile or preached on love here a
[56:13] little bit the other day
[56:15] and what love would do for us
[56:17] you mean love just loving an animal
[56:23] a a a rank 2 000 pound bull just putting
[56:26] love and shadow and love upon him will
[56:28] cause him to turn
[56:30] he said i just loved him he said that
[56:32] seems strange but i thought poor fella i
[56:34] disturbed him
[56:35] he said i wasn't no more afraid of him
[56:38] he wasn't going to hurt me he said there
[56:40] was no fear at all i loved him and he
[56:43] said he started coming towards me with
[56:44] his head down like that and throwing
[56:47] dirt all over his back has anybody ever
[56:48] seen a bull do that
[56:50] it's not a fun sight
[56:52] they begin to paw and they stick their
[56:53] head in the ground they throw dirt up
[56:55] about 10 feet in the air they mean
[56:56] business
[56:58] and a 2 000 pound bull will crush you in
[57:00] an instant
[57:02] and here's this bull coming at him
[57:03] throwing his head up and he said he run
[57:05] right up to me and i thought well that
[57:07] poor fella i'd hate to be woke up like
[57:09] that too
[57:14] you mean the prophet put himself
[57:16] in the place of a bull
[57:18] he put himself there he showed love to
[57:20] him he put himself there and thought i
[57:22] would hate to be woke up like that too
[57:24] and he got down there and i looked and i
[57:25] said now look i'm sorry that i disturbed
[57:28] you i didn't mean to do that
[57:31] you're god's animal
[57:33] and i'm god's servant
[57:35] and
[57:36] god is sending me over here to pray for
[57:37] a sick woman and i'm on god's mission
[57:40] do you remember one of the first things
[57:42] i asked you this morning do you have a
[57:43] mission
[57:46] do you have a godly mission do you come
[57:48] to church with a purpose do you get up
[57:50] every morning and go through life with a
[57:52] purpose for god or are we just going
[57:55] through the motions
[57:56] do you have a purpose i'm on a mission
[57:58] i'm god's servant you don't want to hurt
[58:00] me
[58:01] in the name of jesus go go back to where
[58:04] you are and lay down and he said that
[58:06] bull running right towards me as hard as
[58:08] he could got within five feet
[58:10] and he and then he threw out his feet
[58:12] and stopped
[58:17] five feet
[58:21] he threw out his feet and stopped like
[58:22] that and he looked sideways
[58:25] can you imagine
[58:27] that bull
[58:29] that was just kicking up dirt and just
[58:30] had one mission on his mind to put that
[58:32] man in the ground and now he still comes
[58:34] to a halt and says
[58:36] huh
[58:39] my thoughts have changed
[58:42] i no longer want to kill you
[58:45] i don't know why
[58:47] but i no longer want to kill you and he
[58:49] said he started to look at him sideways
[58:50] and look so depleted
[58:53] don't you love it when you can deplete
[58:54] the devil
[58:56] when the devil comes at you and he's
[58:58] raging he's rampant and he's throwing
[59:00] dust and snorting and kicking and coming
[59:01] to you to kill you and you can say stop
[59:06] and he's depleted
[59:09] wow
[59:11] and he said and he he turned right
[59:12] around and he went over there and laid
[59:14] right down under that tree
[59:16] and that's a killer
[59:21] brother and sister
[59:23] that's when we have to realize that
[59:25] god's still alive
[59:26] and that's what the prophet said he said
[59:28] god's not dead i did that because god is
[59:31] still alive it's the same god that was
[59:33] there in daniel's day just like it's the
[59:35] same god that was there in the prophet's
[59:37] day for us and we learn constantly from
[59:40] these experiences to
[59:42] draw us closer into a place that we can
[59:44] operate in a godly fashion
[59:50] he said last summer i was mowing my yard
[59:54] it's a big yard
[59:58] as all the kids heard these stories i
[1:00:00] think all you adults have
[1:00:02] all the kids heard them maybe some
[1:00:04] sometimes
[1:00:06] learn from them i was in my backyard he
[1:00:08] said mow in the yard
[1:00:10] and i couldn't get nobody to help me i
[1:00:12] mowed a few rounds and and i had to run
[1:00:14] in and take my overalls off
[1:00:17] don't you just love seeing the prophet
[1:00:19] as a human
[1:00:24] i had to run in and take my overalls off
[1:00:28] and i put on my suit and i had to go in
[1:00:29] and pray for them and then i get
[1:00:31] get rid of them run them back out and
[1:00:33] i'd make a couple more rounds and the
[1:00:35] grass was growing in the front yard
[1:00:36] before i could get the backwood mowed
[1:00:38] and he said i was in the backyard one
[1:00:39] afternoon a pair of overalls and i just
[1:00:42] taken my shirt off you know it was hot
[1:00:44] and i was mowing as hard as i could this
[1:00:46] little low mower and there's a fence
[1:00:47] that runs down beside a bird box he said
[1:00:50] i put a little martin house up for the
[1:00:51] kitties
[1:00:53] and right in there there was a bunch of
[1:00:54] hornets that had built in there
[1:00:57] and he said and me with no shirt on and
[1:01:00] he said and there i was i bumped up
[1:01:02] against it
[1:01:03] and against that fence and they covered
[1:01:05] me in just a few minutes time
[1:01:09] and me with no shirt on
[1:01:12] brother sister that's a good time to
[1:01:13] call god seen
[1:01:16] sometimes we find ourselves in
[1:01:17] situations that we didn't intend
[1:01:20] and sometimes
[1:01:22] these situations can get a little bit
[1:01:23] sticky
[1:01:25] and i don't know if you've ever been
[1:01:27] surrounded by bees or hornets but it's
[1:01:29] not a fun experience
[1:01:31] i keep bees on the phone and i put on
[1:01:33] bee suit and i i try to cover up hands
[1:01:36] and arms and face
[1:01:38] but i had a hive over at our place and i
[1:01:40] asked the guy about the beer i said did
[1:01:42] you sell me killer bees
[1:01:45] he said i don't think so
[1:01:47] i know these things are devils
[1:01:52] i said i take the lid off i smoke them i
[1:01:54] do everything i'm supposed to do and i
[1:01:56] take the lid off and they just come
[1:01:57] boiling up out of there i said you can't
[1:01:59] control them he said really yeah really
[1:02:05] and i'm working the bees and of course
[1:02:06] it's the best hive i've got and i got
[1:02:08] them i finally got it broke apart and
[1:02:10] trying to get the honey and i'm setting
[1:02:11] the hive the box over here in this box
[1:02:13] over here and and next thing i know ah
[1:02:16] they got me in the leg got me in this
[1:02:17] leg
[1:02:20] and then i feel something and they're
[1:02:22] just beating my leather gloves
[1:02:25] i'm talking 15 20 at a time on each hand
[1:02:28] and i'm doing this i'm shaking and i'm
[1:02:31] going to get away from this stuff
[1:02:33] so i walk over and just give them a
[1:02:34] minute and i thought i'll let them calm
[1:02:36] down
[1:02:38] hey it looked like they calmed down
[1:02:40] i said they look like they've calmed
[1:02:41] down
[1:02:43] and here they come again and hundreds of
[1:02:45] bees coming up bowling out of here and
[1:02:47] just surrounding me and trying to get me
[1:02:48] from every direction it's not a fun
[1:02:50] feeling
[1:02:51] and he said here these beasts surrounded
[1:02:53] him
[1:02:55] they mean business brothers and sisters
[1:02:56] they surround him and they said you know
[1:02:58] i thought the same thing about the bull
[1:03:02] i didn't mean to bother you i didn't
[1:03:04] mean to disturb you
[1:03:06] and he said little fellas i'm sorry that
[1:03:08] i deserve to disturb you i'm god's
[1:03:10] servant
[1:03:11] how many of you here today are doing
[1:03:13] something for
[1:03:14] god you're putting your life on display
[1:03:19] i hear your comments when i talk to you
[1:03:21] you're witnessing here you're witnessing
[1:03:22] there you're trying to spread the
[1:03:23] message you're trying to spread the
[1:03:25] gospel of jesus christ you're serving
[1:03:27] god as you serve others
[1:03:30] and he said i'm god's servant
[1:03:32] and he said people come here and i
[1:03:34] minister to him and he said i'm in a
[1:03:35] hurry to get the art mode i'm sorry i
[1:03:37] disturb you now in the name of jesus
[1:03:39] christ little fellas go back to your box
[1:03:41] and i'll disturb you no more
[1:03:45] i didn't have that kind of faith
[1:03:49] these beans were boiling out of that box
[1:03:50] but the problem said go back
[1:03:52] and and go back to your box and he said
[1:03:54] them hornets
[1:03:56] they lined up one by one
[1:03:59] and went straight back into that box
[1:04:04] and never bothered him
[1:04:05] again
[1:04:09] calling god on the scene
[1:04:12] what was his expectation what do you
[1:04:14] think the prophet was expecting when he
[1:04:17] said
[1:04:18] in the name of jesus christ
[1:04:20] go back into your box
[1:04:23] what was his
[1:04:24] expectations when he
[1:04:26] spoke to that bull and said now go back
[1:04:28] over there i'll bother you no more do
[1:04:30] you think he thought well i'm going to
[1:04:31] say this but i'm probably fixing to get
[1:04:33] killed
[1:04:35] no
[1:04:36] it's all in your mind in the way we
[1:04:38] think in the way we believe in our faith
[1:04:40] as our faith gets stronger when you say
[1:04:42] what you mean and you mean what you say
[1:04:44] in the name of jesus christ go back into
[1:04:46] the box
[1:04:47] he never had a doubt in his mind that
[1:04:49] those hornets were going to go back
[1:04:52] he knew that something had happened in
[1:04:54] his life and had changed him in a way
[1:04:56] that he could speak to those hornets and
[1:04:58] they do exactly what he said to do
[1:05:06] he said he was in portland oregon one
[1:05:08] more and we're going to move on
[1:05:10] just getting my foundation
[1:05:12] he was in portland oregon
[1:05:15] and he said he was in a meeting there
[1:05:17] the other night
[1:05:19] standing there preaching and i've seen
[1:05:22] this great big huge fellow running there
[1:05:24] like this with his hands shaking
[1:05:28] and he said i thought maybe he had a
[1:05:29] telegram for someone
[1:05:32] he said and all of a sudden he got up to
[1:05:34] the platform and there were about 200
[1:05:35] preachers standing back there behind me
[1:05:37] on the platform and they just shrunk out
[1:05:39] of the building and i thought what's the
[1:05:41] matter
[1:05:43] he said and here this fellow turned
[1:05:45] around great shoulder stood about six
[1:05:47] foot and a half tall
[1:05:48] and big fists great arms and he said i
[1:05:51] weighed about 128 at the time
[1:05:54] little man big stature
[1:05:56] i weighed about 128 at the time
[1:05:59] and he said but he must have weighed
[1:06:00] about 250 or 260
[1:06:03] and he looked at me and he said you
[1:06:04] snake in the grass you're imposing
[1:06:06] yourself as a man of god i'm gonna break
[1:06:08] every bone in your weasley little body
[1:06:11] and show you
[1:06:13] what you're made of has sat never talk
[1:06:16] to you like that
[1:06:18] and satan never come to you and threaten
[1:06:20] you and say i'm going to break every
[1:06:21] bone in your body i'm going to expose
[1:06:23] i'm going to show everybody that you're
[1:06:25] not truly a child of god i'm going to
[1:06:27] show everybody that you're not rapture
[1:06:28] material i'm going to show everybody
[1:06:30] that you have no faith
[1:06:33] and this man comes up to him
[1:06:36] and he's putting his threats upon him
[1:06:39] and he said well i thought my
[1:06:42] this great big fella
[1:06:44] he's able to carry out his threat
[1:06:46] he said i turned around and there was no
[1:06:48] preachers left
[1:06:51] 200 of them
[1:06:53] you know sometimes we're going through
[1:06:55] our
[1:06:55] most threatening times of our life and
[1:06:57] there ain't a friend to be found
[1:07:01] why is that
[1:07:02] who do you have to depend on
[1:07:05] amen
[1:07:07] god puts us in those places sometimes
[1:07:09] where and we're between a rock and a
[1:07:10] hard place so that he can come in and
[1:07:12] say now you have nobody in your life
[1:07:14] there is no friends that's going to
[1:07:15] stand for you nobody's going to have
[1:07:17] your back but you will have to rely on
[1:07:20] me where do you stand
[1:07:22] what are your expectations this morning
[1:07:25] and he said so i looked everywhere and i
[1:07:26] guess i noticed that this man was out a
[1:07:29] maniac out of the insane institute and
[1:07:31] come to find out he had broken the jaw
[1:07:33] of a preacher just the week before
[1:07:35] and he's looking at this man face to
[1:07:37] face now
[1:07:42] and i was standing there and i thought
[1:07:43] well what was i going to say
[1:07:46] i said well what's the matter with you
[1:07:48] sir
[1:07:49] what's the matter with you sir
[1:07:52] and just about that time the same thing
[1:07:54] happened
[1:07:56] the presence of the lord
[1:07:59] came in and i just kept still
[1:08:04] how many times have we been talking
[1:08:05] about just yielding to the presence of
[1:08:08] the lord
[1:08:10] the presence of the lord came down he
[1:08:12] said and i just kept still so he was
[1:08:14] yielding himself to the lord he said and
[1:08:16] he walked towards me with those big
[1:08:17] fists drawn and and everybody was
[1:08:20] breathless and he said i'll break every
[1:08:22] bone in your body i'll knock you plumb
[1:08:24] back over in the middle of the floor you
[1:08:26] snake in the grass
[1:08:29] i never said a word
[1:08:32] looked up
[1:08:33] up to him like that
[1:08:34] he was coming to me with his teeth set
[1:08:37] tighter his eyes
[1:08:39] bulged in he looked at him and i never
[1:08:41] said a word
[1:08:43] but he said brother you better know
[1:08:45] where you're talking about in those
[1:08:47] kinds of times
[1:08:49] you better know what you're talking
[1:08:50] about in those kinds of times
[1:08:53] he said and then about then i heard
[1:08:55] something talking
[1:08:57] and it was myself
[1:08:59] he said and it said because you have
[1:09:01] challenged the spirit of god tonight
[1:09:02] you'll fall over my feet
[1:09:06] and that maniac looked at him and he
[1:09:07] said i'll show you
[1:09:10] i'll show you that i won't be falling
[1:09:12] over your feet tonight because you're a
[1:09:14] hypocrite and he walked right to me and
[1:09:17] spit in his face
[1:09:20] wow
[1:09:23] you're talking about having to have the
[1:09:24] presence of god in your life
[1:09:27] and he said and i looked at him and said
[1:09:28] satan come out of this man in the name
[1:09:31] of jesus christ he threw his hands up
[1:09:34] his eyes bulged way out and he turned
[1:09:37] around and around and fell on the floor
[1:09:38] and pinned my feet to the floor
[1:09:44] was this because it was the prophet
[1:09:48] no it's because he stood where jesus
[1:09:50] christ was
[1:09:51] jesus christ was right there and this
[1:09:54] man who had made threats upon jesus
[1:09:56] christ and the ministry of jesus christ
[1:09:58] now stands pinned to the floor of the
[1:10:00] man of god
[1:10:08] he said the police had to come and roll
[1:10:10] him off of there before he could move
[1:10:12] his feet
[1:10:18] the presence of almighty god no matter
[1:10:19] what it is he's lord he's a very present
[1:10:22] help in a time of trouble don't be
[1:10:24] afraid he says
[1:10:25] stand your ground when god moves god is
[1:10:28] god and he will do it
[1:10:31] now if he says tonight if the lord jesus
[1:10:33] christ has promised us this thing
[1:10:36] that if we would believe why it's all
[1:10:39] things are possible do you believe that
[1:10:41] all things
[1:10:42] these are possible
[1:10:45] what was the ministry of the prophet
[1:10:47] what did the angel tell him he said the
[1:10:49] angel told him said if you can get the
[1:10:50] people to believe
[1:10:55] to believe on william
[1:10:56] branham no he said if you get the people
[1:10:59] to believe then all things are public
[1:11:01] impossible if they can believe on jesus
[1:11:03] christ brothers and sisters the who's
[1:11:05] was those stories told for
[1:11:07] those stories were told for you and they
[1:11:08] were told for me that was our training
[1:11:10] it was to build our confidence in christ
[1:11:13] these stories are more important than
[1:11:15] just a story back in 1960
[1:11:19] but what has happened
[1:11:21] the truth of the matter is we've let
[1:11:23] stories become common
[1:11:28] i can i can about assure you that as i
[1:11:30] began to tell these stories there were
[1:11:32] some thoughts going through this
[1:11:33] building i've heard this before
[1:11:37] we've heard this ten times we've heard
[1:11:39] this a hundred times
[1:11:41] don't we have any new material
[1:11:43] we gotta learn from material we got
[1:11:45] first
[1:11:46] we gotta learn how to put the material
[1:11:48] we got into action first
[1:11:50] and so many times we hear these stories
[1:11:52] and they become common and preachers in
[1:11:54] the past i got to be careful right here
[1:11:56] but preachers in the past
[1:11:59] they have preached these stories in such
[1:12:00] a way that it appears that these things
[1:12:02] can only happen in the life of william
[1:12:05] branham
[1:12:07] and that's simply not the case
[1:12:10] it happens in the children of god
[1:12:12] god is willing to meet your expectations
[1:12:15] when you come to those places where you
[1:12:16] say god i need and i expect and i need
[1:12:19] you to move on the scene god is there
[1:12:21] when we draw god close
[1:12:23] just like he was for the prophet
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:30] he was he was close to god
[1:12:33] no doubt probably way closer than i am
[1:12:37] and i try and i try to get closer and
[1:12:40] closer
[1:12:42] because i want the same kind of
[1:12:45] spirit
[1:12:46] and i want to see the same kind of
[1:12:48] things come to fruition that happened in
[1:12:50] his life
[1:12:52] but they wasn't just for him where is
[1:12:54] god when we need god
[1:12:56] where is god when we need god
[1:13:00] the message of the hour wasn't for the
[1:13:01] prophet
[1:13:06] it was for millions
[1:13:08] that would hear
[1:13:09] the message of the hour
[1:13:12] he was merely a servant
[1:13:14] in the hands of god
[1:13:17] a man what was his title a man sent from
[1:13:21] god
[1:13:24] he wasn't a man for god
[1:13:27] the only man from god
[1:13:30] a man sent from god to bring a message
[1:13:33] that would deliver the people around the
[1:13:35] world
[1:13:37] luke chapter 3 if you want to follow
[1:13:38] along
[1:13:42] and the people were in expectation
[1:13:46] chapter 3 verse 15.
[1:13:53] john the baptist here has been
[1:13:55] ministering and preaching
[1:13:59] and the people were in expectation
[1:14:02] and all men mused in their hearts of
[1:14:05] john
[1:14:06] so they looked and they were absorbed in
[1:14:08] their thoughts they were absorbed in
[1:14:10] their thoughts and john and said whether
[1:14:12] he is the christ or not so we see
[1:14:15] desperate people in an eager
[1:14:17] expectation of their messiah coming
[1:14:20] and i like what one translation i've
[1:14:22] seen and i heard a preacher preaching
[1:14:23] and he said the expectation was and the
[1:14:26] translation was that the people were on
[1:14:28] tiptoes and anticipation and expectation
[1:14:33] the people were on their tiptoes
[1:14:35] and it reminded me of the little story
[1:14:37] that the prophet told with the little
[1:14:38] boys with no money that wanted to get
[1:14:40] into the carnival
[1:14:42] and here they are standing outside of
[1:14:44] the the fence in area they had so much
[1:14:46] excitement so much anticipation so much
[1:14:50] expectation that they would do whatever
[1:14:52] they had to do to see what was happening
[1:14:53] on the other side of that wooden fence
[1:14:56] and so they began to look there and they
[1:14:58] couldn't saddle brothers and sister for
[1:14:59] somebody else's experience
[1:15:02] they couldn't settle for what the people
[1:15:03] on friday night saw
[1:15:06] they couldn't settle for what the kids
[1:15:08] down the street saw they wanted to get
[1:15:10] there and they wanted to look in there
[1:15:11] for themselves so they had to see so
[1:15:12] what did they do they stood on their
[1:15:14] tiptoes
[1:15:16] and with this anticipation standing on
[1:15:18] their tiptoes looking through the knot
[1:15:19] hole in the fence they wanted to see
[1:15:21] what was on the other side
[1:15:23] and that's what we have to do we have to
[1:15:25] activate our faith to stand on our
[1:15:27] tiptoes and expectation
[1:15:29] knowing that god can do the impossible
[1:15:34] they looked on the other side and they
[1:15:36] stretched up and they looked and one
[1:15:37] might say i see an elephant
[1:15:40] and the other one looked and said i see
[1:15:41] a giraffe
[1:15:42] and the other one said i see
[1:15:44] see a line i can imagine once i get out
[1:15:47] of my way let me see
[1:15:49] brother says i'm we're looking through
[1:15:50] the nut hole i see healing
[1:15:52] i see deliverance i see peace and
[1:15:55] understanding i see love and joy i see
[1:15:58] overcoming i see the power of god i see
[1:16:00] a conqueror i see the line of the tribe
[1:16:03] of judah
[1:16:05] what are your expectations
[1:16:10] it's for you this morning
[1:16:12] it's for you this morning to
[1:16:14] expect and to receive
[1:16:17] what you have expected
[1:16:20] turn with me to acts chapter three
[1:16:25] acts chapter three
[1:16:32] very familiar story
[1:16:38] peter and john went up together into the
[1:16:40] temple at the hour of prayer being the
[1:16:42] ninth hour
[1:16:44] here lays this certain man lame from his
[1:16:46] mother's womb
[1:16:49] and he lays up the day at the gate
[1:16:52] day to day at the temple which is called
[1:16:54] beautiful and he's there to ask alms of
[1:16:56] the people who's entering into the
[1:16:58] temple
[1:17:00] who's seeing peter and john about to go
[1:17:02] into the temple asking all
[1:17:04] and peter fastened his eyes upon him
[1:17:06] with john and said look on us
[1:17:10] and he gave heed unto them what
[1:17:12] expecting to receive
[1:17:15] something from them
[1:17:17] now what was he expecting to receive
[1:17:20] he was expected to receive a little
[1:17:22] silver a little piece of gold a little a
[1:17:24] little bit of a trinket a little
[1:17:25] something he could spin and put into his
[1:17:27] savings
[1:17:28] that's what he was looking to receive
[1:17:30] but peter looked at him and he said
[1:17:32] silver and gold have i not
[1:17:35] but such as i have i give of thee in the
[1:17:38] name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up
[1:17:40] and walk
[1:17:42] and he takes this lame man by the hand
[1:17:45] he lifts him up and immediately it says
[1:17:47] his feet and his ankles come together
[1:17:49] his feet and his ankles come under him
[1:17:51] and he stood and he leaped and he walked
[1:17:54] and can you imagine the people as they
[1:17:56] begin to look upon this man who laid for
[1:17:58] his whole entire life at the gate asking
[1:18:00] for money because he's crippled his feet
[1:18:03] turned in legs drawn up muscles
[1:18:05] atrophied
[1:18:07] and they see this man now running but
[1:18:09] what was it
[1:18:10] from birth he was carried to the temple
[1:18:13] day after day to beg
[1:18:17] his life
[1:18:19] revolved around his sickness
[1:18:22] his life revolved around his sickness
[1:18:25] day in and day out
[1:18:28] but this day
[1:18:30] something was about to change
[1:18:32] this day something was about to change
[1:18:35] this day this man activated his faith
[1:18:38] this day this man received a miracle
[1:18:40] right then and there because of his
[1:18:42] great expectations so when he when he
[1:18:44] says what if i'm expecting expect him to
[1:18:47] receive what god i will honor your
[1:18:50] expectations
[1:18:51] even though you need money even though
[1:18:53] you need silver even though you need
[1:18:54] gold you have faithful and i know your
[1:18:57] true expectations
[1:19:02] what if he just said
[1:19:04] i've been here every day of my life
[1:19:07] i guess i'm destined to be here
[1:19:10] i guess i'm just going to be here every
[1:19:11] day of my life and
[1:19:14] give me a little gold give me a little
[1:19:16] silver
[1:19:18] you think he would have got his miracle
[1:19:20] no he would not have received his
[1:19:22] miracle
[1:19:23] because he hadn't got down there with
[1:19:24] the right kind of expectation but
[1:19:25] because he expected
[1:19:30] mark chapter 10.
[1:19:38] for even
[1:19:39] chapter 10 verse 45
[1:19:46] for even the son of man
[1:19:48] came not to be ministered to but to
[1:19:50] minister
[1:19:51] and to give his life a ransom for many
[1:19:54] they came to jericho and went out
[1:19:56] jericho with his disciples and a great
[1:19:57] number of people blind bartimaeus the
[1:19:59] son of timaeus
[1:20:00] sat by the highway side begging
[1:20:03] and when he had heard that jesus of
[1:20:04] nazareth he began to cry out and say
[1:20:07] jesus now son of david have mercy
[1:20:10] on me
[1:20:15] and what happened
[1:20:17] many charged him
[1:20:19] and commanded him and told him to hold
[1:20:22] your peace
[1:20:26] but he cried out more a great deal thou
[1:20:29] son of david have mercy on me
[1:20:31] and jesus stood still and commanded him
[1:20:32] to be called and they called the blood
[1:20:34] man saying to him be of good comfort
[1:20:36] rise he calleth thee
[1:20:39] the next sentence is what i want you to
[1:20:41] to see and grasp a hold of
[1:20:44] and he cast away his garment
[1:20:47] and rose and came to jesus
[1:20:50] and jesus says what wilt thou i should
[1:20:52] do unto thee and the blind man said unto
[1:20:55] him lord that i might receive my
[1:20:58] sight. and jesus said unto him go thy
[1:21:02] way thy faith has made thee whole and
[1:21:04] immediately
[1:21:05] not yesterday not today not tomorrow
[1:21:08] immediately right now he received a
[1:21:11] sight and followed jesus
[1:21:13] now brothers and sisters you got to
[1:21:14] realize that in the biblical days
[1:21:17] being blind was a curse
[1:21:19] this guy was cursed people looked at him
[1:21:21] as cursed and the only way that they
[1:21:23] could financially support themselves was
[1:21:25] to go beg in the streets
[1:21:27] well they kind of had a problem similar
[1:21:29] to probably what we got today
[1:21:30] panhandlers out on the street wanting
[1:21:32] money here wanting money there so what
[1:21:34] the government did they gave them a
[1:21:35] cloak
[1:21:37] if you can prove that you're blind
[1:21:39] you're lame and you truly need uh
[1:21:41] financial help we're gonna give you a
[1:21:43] cloak
[1:21:44] and this garment had significant colors
[1:21:46] it had significant markings and they had
[1:21:49] to wear this in order to bag it on the
[1:21:50] street and only true beggars could get
[1:21:52] it
[1:21:54] so here he is in the street
[1:21:56] with his cloak on
[1:21:59] permission to beg
[1:22:02] and here he is blind
[1:22:05] no doubt his ears are sharpened to the
[1:22:07] things going on around him and as they
[1:22:10] sit in their blind
[1:22:12] and he hears the conversations of the
[1:22:14] people walking down the streets
[1:22:16] there's a man called jesus
[1:22:18] there's a man called jesus and the
[1:22:20] miracles are being performed over and
[1:22:22] over we we're seeing all these things
[1:22:24] and bartimaeus can't believe but
[1:22:26] something begins to spark inside of it
[1:22:28] and he says you know what i want to meet
[1:22:29] this jesus i want to see this jesus
[1:22:32] and jesus is coming through the town and
[1:22:34] they say here comes jesus and he can
[1:22:36] hear it and he says jesus
[1:22:40] thou son of david
[1:22:42] have mercy on me
[1:22:51] make a call out to jesus and see what
[1:22:53] happens
[1:22:56] start doing something for jesus and see
[1:22:58] if you don't get try to get quietened
[1:22:59] down
[1:23:00] make it make a move make a stand make a
[1:23:02] make a movement for christ try to do
[1:23:04] something for christ and see what
[1:23:05] happens
[1:23:08] you can't do that
[1:23:10] don't you know who this man is
[1:23:16] jesus he called again
[1:23:20] have mercy on me
[1:23:23] thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:23:27] but this time it was different
[1:23:30] this time he had an opportunity to meet
[1:23:31] the healer face to face and he was not
[1:23:33] going to be silenced anymore and as
[1:23:35] jesus looked at him it says he threw his
[1:23:37] cloak aside
[1:23:39] he threw off this garment why is that so
[1:23:41] significant he threw off his garment
[1:23:43] because he's saying i'm throwing away my
[1:23:45] old life
[1:23:47] i won't let this garment hinder me
[1:23:49] anymore i'm throwing off my comfort zone
[1:23:52] i'm getting rid of the way i used to
[1:23:54] live
[1:23:55] and i'm no longer going to be defined as
[1:23:57] a beggar i'm no longer going to be
[1:23:58] living in darkness
[1:24:00] this wasn't just a shirt or a jacket
[1:24:03] this right here was his livelihood
[1:24:04] brothers and sisters this was life or
[1:24:06] death
[1:24:07] this was live or die
[1:24:10] feast or famine
[1:24:12] how many of us are willing to do that
[1:24:14] when god calls
[1:24:16] we call out to god a lot jesus jesus i
[1:24:18] need i need jesus jesus i ah
[1:24:22] but are we willing to take off our cloak
[1:24:26] are we willing to cast away all of the
[1:24:28] old things in our life
[1:24:31] are we willing to step aside and say god
[1:24:32] i'm not gonna live for you
[1:24:39] but this guy was so desperate for a
[1:24:40] change
[1:24:43] he threw away his garment
[1:24:45] still blind as a bat
[1:24:50] still blind as a bat throws away his
[1:24:53] garment
[1:24:55] and makes a stand for christ
[1:24:58] i want to remind you about something
[1:25:04] i want you to think and be reminded that
[1:25:06] the devil is not concerned
[1:25:09] with what you used to be
[1:25:13] think about that
[1:25:16] he's not concerned with what you used to
[1:25:18] be
[1:25:20] and i want you to think that the devil
[1:25:21] is not concerned with what you
[1:25:24] are let that sink in for just a minute
[1:25:29] he's not concerned with what you used to
[1:25:30] be or what you are he's quite content if
[1:25:33] you remain just in your old crippled
[1:25:37] your old blind state he's content with
[1:25:41] you being right there
[1:25:44] and never expecting things to
[1:25:47] be
[1:25:49] content
[1:25:55] you're not a threat to him in that state
[1:25:59] you're not a threat to the devil right
[1:26:00] now
[1:26:05] but you know what torments him
[1:26:09] what torments satan is when you get into
[1:26:11] a place he's terrorized at the thought
[1:26:14] of what you can be
[1:26:16] that's exactly right
[1:26:18] you say i'm not what i used to be you're
[1:26:20] not what i want to be i'm not i'm not
[1:26:22] what i ought to be
[1:26:23] but you there's more for you brothers
[1:26:25] and sisters
[1:26:27] there's more for us as believers and we
[1:26:29] got to keep going and going and we got
[1:26:30] to get up on our tiptoes with the spirit
[1:26:32] of expectation and saying that the best
[1:26:34] is still yet to come
[1:26:36] tomorrow is a different day tomorrow
[1:26:39] i'll do more for christ
[1:26:45] you don't have to see it to believe it
[1:26:48] just start now
[1:26:50] praising expectation you say well i
[1:26:52] don't feel like praising the lord pray
[1:26:54] anyway well i don't feel good i'm tired
[1:26:57] praise god anyway you say well my
[1:26:59] business is not doing well
[1:27:02] soak your crops with expectation see
[1:27:04] what happens put the expectation that
[1:27:07] you want god to bless out there and see
[1:27:09] if he blesses you say well i don't even
[1:27:11] have the strength to pray
[1:27:13] pray
[1:27:14] with expectation
[1:27:19] expect the outpouring of the holy spirit
[1:27:21] in every area of your life because god
[1:27:23] is able if we just tiptoe
[1:27:27] if we tiptoe up and we look and we get
[1:27:29] up and we say today i expect god to move
[1:27:32] today i can be healed
[1:27:35] today i can be filled today i can be
[1:27:37] blessed today i can be anointed
[1:27:42] so where are you expecting god
[1:27:44] to break through in your life
[1:27:52] one last story
[1:27:53] this story is always amazed me
[1:28:00] there was a prophet of god coming from
[1:28:02] dallas texas
[1:28:05] he's flying from dallas texas
[1:28:08] and he said we got in a storm and we
[1:28:10] were forced
[1:28:12] to land
[1:28:14] they didn't say
[1:28:15] flight 282 you might want to detour
[1:28:18] flight 282 you might want to uh just go
[1:28:21] around these clouds
[1:28:24] you might want to go a few few thousand
[1:28:26] feet higher to get over the clouds but
[1:28:28] he said you are forced to land you find
[1:28:30] the the the airport right now in memphis
[1:28:33] tennessee
[1:28:37] and and this airplane is grounded by the
[1:28:40] storm and he's there all night long
[1:28:43] and he said they put him in a hotel he
[1:28:45] didn't know what to do so he started
[1:28:47] writing letters and somehow god just
[1:28:49] constantly orchestrates in our lives
[1:28:52] and he begins to write these letters
[1:28:54] and he's going about his business he
[1:28:56] gets up the next morning and it's
[1:28:57] supposed to be at the limousine at x
[1:29:00] number of time to take him to the
[1:29:02] airport
[1:29:04] and he said he just got to sitting there
[1:29:07] and all of a sudden something said stop
[1:29:09] a minute
[1:29:13] stop a minute he said i was thinking
[1:29:16] and i just kept going
[1:29:18] see he wasn't always obedient to the
[1:29:19] word either
[1:29:21] he said i just kept going
[1:29:23] he said but then something said again
[1:29:25] stop a minute
[1:29:27] he said so i had these letters in my
[1:29:29] pocket and i thought well i'll put them
[1:29:30] in the mailbox on the corner
[1:29:32] and then something said just keep
[1:29:34] walking
[1:29:35] and i thought well i better get back i'm
[1:29:37] going to miss my limo ride
[1:29:39] just keep walking
[1:29:42] i started again and i turned to go this
[1:29:44] way and something said just keep walking
[1:29:47] you know sometimes when we're doing
[1:29:49] something and we're going forward with
[1:29:50] god and god's moving in our life things
[1:29:52] are going good and the devil comes and
[1:29:54] he starts saying things to us back and
[1:29:56] forth sometimes we just gotta look at
[1:29:57] them and say i'm just gonna keep walking
[1:30:00] i'm just gonna keep walking with where
[1:30:01] god wants me to be
[1:30:03] it doesn't matter what anybody thinks
[1:30:05] what anybody says what anybody does i'm
[1:30:07] just going to keep walking
[1:30:09] and he says i'm just going to keep
[1:30:10] walking i went on walking first thing
[1:30:12] you know i come over on the other side
[1:30:14] of the river part there
[1:30:15] and i find myself in a little colored
[1:30:17] district
[1:30:18] and a bunch of shadies
[1:30:21] he said the sun was high i looked at my
[1:30:22] watch it was already 7 30 and i was two
[1:30:25] miles from the hotel but something just
[1:30:27] kept saying
[1:30:28] walk
[1:30:31] i just walked i started singing that
[1:30:33] little song
[1:30:34] there are people almost everywhere whose
[1:30:37] hearts are all aflame
[1:30:41] and he said i was humming it and i
[1:30:43] looked over there at this little shannon
[1:30:44] leaning across the gate was this typical
[1:30:46] old aunt jemima
[1:30:50] she had a shirt tied around her head
[1:30:53] and great big fat cheeks
[1:30:55] and he said i was about 40 yards from
[1:30:57] her and she was humming and i was
[1:30:58] humming that song and i passed on by it
[1:31:02] was such a beautiful morning
[1:31:04] the the storm had come through the roses
[1:31:06] the honeysuckle the fragrance was
[1:31:08] bursting and and this old colored woman
[1:31:10] i passed side she passed by she said
[1:31:12] good morning pawson
[1:31:16] and i turned and looked at her
[1:31:19] and i said good morning auntie
[1:31:22] and he said tears
[1:31:26] tears was running down those big black
[1:31:27] fat cheeks
[1:31:30] and she was smiling
[1:31:33] and i said how did you know i was a
[1:31:34] person
[1:31:36] listen what she said
[1:31:38] i know you was coming
[1:31:42] how does she know
[1:31:45] you talk about her expectation
[1:31:48] she had such an expectation
[1:31:50] how did you know auntie
[1:31:52] she said did you ever read in a bible
[1:31:54] about that shulamite woman
[1:31:56] yes ma'am i have i i was that kind of
[1:31:59] woman
[1:32:00] i had no children i was a wash woman
[1:32:04] and said i promised the lord if he'd
[1:32:05] ever give me a child i'd raise it for
[1:32:07] his glory and he said i've been a
[1:32:09] christian ever since i was a little baby
[1:32:11] girl
[1:32:13] no doubt she had an old nanny
[1:32:16] that taught her the word of god
[1:32:18] she said in some holy ghost meetings too
[1:32:22] now here she says
[1:32:24] not on not on grandma's experience
[1:32:27] but on her experience
[1:32:29] because it's her child
[1:32:32] laying there dying
[1:32:35] and she looked to be in her 50s or 60s
[1:32:38] and she said the lord gave me a fine boy
[1:32:40] parson said but he got out with the
[1:32:42] wrong company
[1:32:43] and he took a disease syphilis
[1:32:46] and his blood was four plus and the
[1:32:48] doctor man said that there was nothing
[1:32:50] he could be done for him
[1:32:51] and he's in the room dying
[1:32:54] and the doctor man had left the day
[1:32:56] before yesterday and he's unconscious
[1:32:58] that he would never gain consciousness
[1:33:00] again
[1:33:02] she said parson i just couldn't stand to
[1:33:04] see my baby in that condition
[1:33:09] said i prayed to the lord all night
[1:33:11] before last and all last night
[1:33:15] and along about two o'clock in the
[1:33:17] morning i fell asleep
[1:33:20] and i dreamed that i was talking to the
[1:33:23] lord
[1:33:24] she said lord you gave me the baby just
[1:33:26] like you did this you know white woman
[1:33:28] but where's my elisha
[1:33:32] and the lord told me to look
[1:33:35] and i seen a man coming
[1:33:39] and this man was wearing a tan suit and
[1:33:41] a little tan hat
[1:33:43] and said it was you parson
[1:33:47] and i has been standing here at this
[1:33:48] gate before daylight waiting for you to
[1:33:50] come
[1:33:52] and i said auntie my name is branham
[1:33:54] did you ever hear of me
[1:33:57] no sir
[1:33:59] it wasn't about brother brown
[1:34:01] that's where we get this story mixed up
[1:34:04] we want to put the emphasis on what
[1:34:05] brother branham did here no no no
[1:34:09] this story is about her and her
[1:34:11] situation
[1:34:13] says parson branham did you ever hear me
[1:34:16] no he said i pray for the sick
[1:34:18] no sir i never did hear of you
[1:34:22] and she wasn't interested this is what
[1:34:23] the prophet said she wasn't interested
[1:34:25] about praying for the sick
[1:34:28] she didn't want her boy to die in that
[1:34:30] lost condition
[1:34:35] he said i went in through that chain old
[1:34:37] chain hanging gate there and and you
[1:34:39] know he said it had a plow uh
[1:34:41] shank on it to pull it back shut and he
[1:34:43] said i went into that house no rug on
[1:34:45] the floor no iron
[1:34:47] uh an old iron bed beds uh steed and
[1:34:50] black boy laying there about 180 pounds
[1:34:53] six foot tall
[1:34:55] and he said i looked around and there
[1:34:56] was a sign on the wall and said god
[1:34:58] bless our home and he said i've been in
[1:35:00] king's palaces

[1:35:12] i'm not pronouncing these right many
[1:35:14] other places and i've been welcomed but
[1:35:16] i never felt any more welcome than i did
[1:35:17] in that little shack that morning
[1:35:19] because
[1:35:20] god
[1:35:21] was there
[1:35:25] that's where i want to be i don't have
[1:35:28] to be rich
[1:35:29] i don't have to be increased goods i
[1:35:31] don't have to have the pleasures and the
[1:35:33] good things of life
[1:35:34] but let god be there
[1:35:36] let god be there over my family let god
[1:35:39] be in my home let god be first
[1:35:45] and he said i walked in and that big boy
[1:35:47] laying there had a blanket in his hand
[1:35:49] going huh
[1:35:52] i said good morning sir she said parsons
[1:35:54] he ain't spoke the word and know nothing
[1:35:56] for three days he's dying
[1:35:59] she knew her situation
[1:36:01] he's dying
[1:36:03] and i looked at her and she said will we
[1:36:05] pray
[1:36:06] and i knelt down on the floor and that
[1:36:08] little boy that boy said huh
[1:36:12] and he said i thought that poor fella i
[1:36:14] felt his feet they were just as stiff
[1:36:16] and icy as they could be
[1:36:19] i don't know if you've ever felt that
[1:36:20] but it's a feeling you never forget
[1:36:23] when somebody's dying
[1:36:27] as nurses i felt it many times
[1:36:33] and he said he's very sick
[1:36:35] what's he
[1:36:36] mumbling he said parson he's saying it's
[1:36:39] dark in here he's been saying it for
[1:36:41] three days and he thinks he's on the
[1:36:42] ocean lost
[1:36:44] and he's in a little boat and he thinks
[1:36:46] he's rowing this boat and he's lost in
[1:36:48] the dark and he's screaming
[1:36:50] and tears are now running down her face
[1:36:52] as she's telling us to
[1:36:53] to brother brown and says parson i just
[1:36:55] can't stand to see my baby die like this
[1:37:03] and i said let's pray auntie
[1:37:06] and we knelt down and watch what he did
[1:37:10] and i said
[1:37:11] you pray
[1:37:15] you pray
[1:37:16] that's right
[1:37:18] it wasn't the prophet
[1:37:20] it wasn't the man sent from god
[1:37:24] it wasn't all the healing campaigns all
[1:37:26] the crutches all the wheelchairs all the
[1:37:28] cots in africa that was loaded up into
[1:37:30] the busloads
[1:37:33] you pray
[1:37:36] you pray and he said she began to pray
[1:37:38] and i tell you oh my you talk about a
[1:37:40] prayer that black woman rendered a
[1:37:42] prayer to god that would make the
[1:37:43] hardest heart cry i stood there and
[1:37:46] bathed in the beauty
[1:37:48] of god while she was praying and she
[1:37:50] wiped her big eyes out
[1:37:52] and she said
[1:37:54] now will you pray parson
[1:37:57] now will you pray
[1:38:02] i put my hand over his feet i said lord
[1:38:04] i don't know why i was led down here
[1:38:07] but maybe this is the place i can't
[1:38:09] understand but i pray you help this poor
[1:38:11] dear saint of yours who stood faithfully
[1:38:14] her back wet with the dew we're
[1:38:17] through the night in the early morning
[1:38:20] expectation
[1:38:24] sometimes we give up on our expectations
[1:38:27] sometimes we call god for god to come on
[1:38:29] the scene and before the first new drop
[1:38:31] falls we give up on god
[1:38:33] sometimes brothers and sisters we need
[1:38:35] to set our roots set our feet deep into
[1:38:38] the ground and root ourselves like a
[1:38:39] great oak tree and say no matter what
[1:38:41] happens god you need to move on the
[1:38:44] scene for me
[1:38:45] and my expectation god is that you're
[1:38:48] coming and i pray god that whatever i
[1:38:50] have to do to get you here you come
[1:38:56] spare this boy
[1:38:59] spare the life of this poor boy
[1:39:02] he said i got no more no that much more
[1:39:05] out of the prayer until he said mama
[1:39:10] he said i stopped he said yes honey baby
[1:39:12] what does mama baby want
[1:39:15] that's love he says
[1:39:18] that's the love that conquers the bull
[1:39:21] that's the love
[1:39:22] that conquers the hornets
[1:39:26] that's the love that heals the blind
[1:39:29] that's the love and the expectation that
[1:39:31] heals the crippled
[1:39:32] that's the love that's calling us to
[1:39:34] come up higher to a higher place in our
[1:39:37] life
[1:39:38] that we can stand where empty did
[1:39:41] you say i don't want to stand where i
[1:39:42] want to get i don't either but i want to
[1:39:45] know i got that kind of faith and that
[1:39:47] i've got the kind of expectation that
[1:39:48] makes me stand right there when the when
[1:39:51] the going gets tough
[1:39:53] he said what does mama's baby wants
[1:39:56] he said though he would disgrace her
[1:39:59] home
[1:40:00] and was dying in sin with a venereal
[1:40:03] disease
[1:40:04] that mother still loved him
[1:40:07] and he said then i can't help but think
[1:40:08] about the grace of god
[1:40:11] with your names
[1:40:13] engraved on the palms of his hands
[1:40:18] and she began kissing him
[1:40:20] and he said mama
[1:40:22] it's getting light in the room
[1:40:26] in less than five minutes time that boy
[1:40:28] was sitting on the side of the bed and
[1:40:30] he was giving glory to god
[1:40:32] and brother randall said i struck a
[1:40:34] plane i got out of a cab and got out
[1:40:36] there two hours late but it was just
[1:40:38] making the last call
[1:40:41] he said the faith of that colored woman
[1:40:43] grounded that plane and held it there he
[1:40:46] said my when i think of those things and
[1:40:48] the many things i've seen and think how
[1:40:50] rich how pure how fathomless and strong
[1:40:52] the love of god is for a poor
[1:40:55] insignificant peasant ignorant colored
[1:40:57] woman but her prayers grounded the plane
[1:41:00] and held it there and sent me down there
[1:41:02] for that boy
[1:41:06] what expectation
[1:41:11] and brother branham goes on to tell the
[1:41:12] story you know he was going to go uh
[1:41:15] heading to phoenix and he goes into
[1:41:16] memphis into the train station and said
[1:41:18] somebody jumped off the comer running at
[1:41:20] him there and said parson branham
[1:41:23] how do you do
[1:41:26] he said don't you know me
[1:41:28] i don't believe i do son
[1:41:31] he said you remember that morning you
[1:41:32] come down to my house and i was dying
[1:41:36] he said you're not that boy he said yes
[1:41:37] parcel
[1:41:38] i was healed and i was a christian now
[1:41:42] brother brown closes that's that story
[1:41:44] with this right here brother the spirit
[1:41:46] of god leads you if you're expecting him
[1:41:49] to do it
[1:41:50] just as great tonight as it was then as
[1:41:53] it will ever be
[1:41:56] do you love the lord this
