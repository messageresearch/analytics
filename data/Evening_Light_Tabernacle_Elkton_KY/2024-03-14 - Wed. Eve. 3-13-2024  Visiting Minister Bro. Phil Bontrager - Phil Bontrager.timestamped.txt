[45:29] things we tried running here and there
[45:31] we might have tried things in the world
[45:33] we've tried religion but there's one
[45:34] thing we finally found and that
[45:36] satisfies us and that's your presence
[45:39] within us Lord and all we long is to see
[45:42] more of that and
[45:43] father tonight we've gathered here

[46:02] do it father so Lord we're thirsty
[46:04] tonight each one comes we're tired we're

[46:11] us down but tonight will you refresh us
[46:13] with a drink Lord From The Throne of God

[46:24] good to be here again I really

[46:27] the opportunity to come up here and
[46:30] share what's on my heart and just just
[46:34] the
[46:35] atmosphere you walk in here and it's
[46:37] just like this is just a good place to
[46:39] be it's a good place to be I'm gon to
[46:43] read from uh Hebrews 11 we're going to
[46:45] read a couple verses there Hebrews
[46:50] 11 amen I pray everyone's doing well
[46:54] fighting the devil you know it's it's
[46:56] all always good when you're when you're
[46:58] back there and you get ready to come out
[46:59] and you hear the song service and the
[47:01] songs that are being sung and you
[47:03] realize you the same holy spirit that
[47:05] anointed me to say anointed that song
[47:07] leader that special or something to to
[47:10] sing and that special we just heard it
[47:11] just it's just it's what I'm gonna
[47:13] preach tonight it is it's just that
[47:16] daily walk just get up in the morning
[47:18] and go about your business that's all
[47:21] you got to do Hebrews 11:5 it says by
[47:24] faith Enoch was translated that he
[47:25] should not see death and was not found
[47:28] because God had translated him for
[47:31] before his translation he had this
[47:33] testimony that he pleased God you may be
[47:36] seated
[47:38] he pleased God ain't that amazing what a
[47:41] what a testimony recognize this wasn't
[47:43] this wasn't Enoch claiming that this was
[47:46] God claiming that God gave him the
[47:47] testimony hey you're pleasing me and so
[47:49] he walked right out of here in his own
[47:51] personal rapture we know that's a type
[47:53] of us we're going to have to have that
[47:54] Enoch walk and we're going to walk right
[47:56] out of here here in our Rapture and the
[48:00] tribulation Goes On Noah is the type of
[48:02] going through the tribulation but we're
[48:03] going to be out of here are we pleasing
[48:08] God that's all we have to do find out
[48:10] are we pleasing God because if we're
[48:12] pleasing God you have a guaranteed
[48:14] Rapture coming up that's all there is to
[48:17] it Brent it's guaranteed you say it's
[48:19] impossible how in the world can I please
[48:21] God well if you look at it from your
[48:23] point of view of your flesh you're right
[48:25] you cannot please God if you depending
[48:27] on your flesh but we don't have
[48:28] confidence in our
[48:33] flesh confidence in the promise of God
[48:35] estation of it happening in our lives as
[48:37] we go about our business dayto day it's
[48:40] absolutely happening and
[48:43] you can look at that and in spite of all
[48:46] satan says to you oh Satan hates that
[48:53] P positive that positive testimony

[49:09] because when we please God then he
[49:12] had such a we're not grieving him away
[49:16] we're doing what he wants us to do look
[49:18] look let me ask you something has God
[49:20] asked you to do something that you
[49:21] haven't
[49:23] done then what more can you ask for what
[49:27] more can he ask than just to do what he
[49:29] asked you to
[49:30] do that's what you're doing why are you
[49:33] not doing something else you
[49:34] need get a little bit spiritual you get
[49:37] a little bit more religious you need to
[49:39] do a little bit more we're gonna cover
[49:40] that tonight we're g to smack that devil
[49:42] in the
[49:43] face because you don't need to be doing
[49:45] a little bit more you morning go about
[49:48] your business go to bed at night and
[49:50] tomorrow you do the same
[49:52] thing and you're going to walk right
[49:54] into a
[49:55] rapture
[50:00] a by faith you can't please him I don't
[50:02] care how religious you are how many
[50:04] rules you fou everything you're doing
[50:06] you are not pleasing God because you're
[50:07] just being religious and God never asked
[50:10] you just to be religious he said walk by
[50:12] faith because without faith it's
[50:14] impossible to please him for he that
[50:16] comes to God must believe that he is and
[50:18] he is rewarder than that diligently seek
[50:20] him and so people take that and Satan
[50:22] will take that and push your path you
[50:24] need to diligently seek God you need to
[50:25] really be you need to really try you no
[50:28] you
[50:29] don't by faith you simply do by faith
[50:33] what's Faith it's a
[50:34] revelation that makes it so simple well
[50:36] what is Faith I got to have great faith
[50:38] no you have to have normal a everyday
[50:40] average Faith that's what the prophet
[50:43] said it's just normal Faith you don't
[50:44] have to be Supernatural super faithful
[50:46] some of you have great gifts of faith
[50:49] I'm not talking about that but just to
[50:51] walk your daily walk you just need the
[50:52] same Faith you get up in the morning and
[50:54] turn on the light
[50:55] switch that's all it is friends why are
[50:58] we trying to make it something more than
[51:01] that so what is Faith it's a revelation
[51:04] Abraham what he wanted to do what did he
[51:07] do he came to Abraham and said Abraham I
[51:09] want you do this this and this Abraham
[51:10] said okay and that made him
[51:14] righteous it's too simple friends that's
[51:18] the reason people going to miss the
[51:19] Rapture it's too simple they cannot
[51:21] believe it could be that
[51:25] simple a re is God telling you either
[51:28] what to believe or what if you do
[51:31] that you're pleasing to
[51:34] God look look friends it's not a maybe
[51:37] there's not a guess well maybe if I do
[51:38] this maybe if I give a little more in
[51:40] the offering maybe if I have this
[51:41] brother preach uh Pray For Me Maybe if I
[51:44] pray a little bit more here maybe
[51:45] there's not a maybe to it you're just
[51:47] gonna be like Kane Kan well maybe if I
[51:49] do this and maybe if I worship this way
[51:51] there's not a maybe you do what God told
[51:54] you to do and just sit there and be
[51:56] satisfied what what he told you to
[51:58] do when he tells you to believe
[52:00] something you believe it you confess it
[52:02] when he tells you to do something you go
[52:03] do it and that's how you please God
[52:05] because that's Faith it's not a hope so
[52:09] guess so well maybe I should do this
[52:11] maybe I should do that no he told me
[52:13] directly exactly what to do it's a cut
[52:14] and dry decision he said this is what I
[52:16] want you to do I want you to work here I
[52:18] want you to do this I want you to raise
[52:19] your kids I want you to go to this
[52:21] church this is your pastor I want you to
[52:23] give this and the offering I want you to
[52:24] this and you just keep doing what he
[52:26] tells you you to do by Revelation but
[52:28] friends without the Revelation you can
[52:29] have the longest hair in the world you
[52:30] got the longest dress you can do
[52:32] everything exactly following the same
[52:33] rules and
[52:36] God says you're not pleasing me at all
[52:38] your religion he doesn't want you trying
[52:40] real hard he simply wants you to believe
[52:42] what he told you and just walk in that
[52:44] Faith because that's impossible to
[52:46] please him
[52:48] besid
[52:51] that there's no guessing about this
[52:54] let's go back to Hebrews that fourth
[52:56] verse right there right before that
[52:59] 11:4 by faith Abel offered unto God a
[53:02] more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[53:04] which he obtained witness that he was
[53:05] righteous God testifying of his gifts it
[53:09] wasn't able he wasn't say look how look
[53:11] how righteous I am no God testified by
[53:13] accepting the sacrifice he said by it he
[53:16] being dead yet speaketh so you said well
[53:18] then what was the difference between can
[53:19] and Abel why was Cain not accepted
[53:21] because he was not walking in faith Abel
[53:24] was walking in faith God came to look
[53:27] look Abel
[53:30] didn't guess he didn't look at Kan and
[53:34] said let me see God didn't accept his
[53:35] fruit and vegetables maybe where it no
[53:38] no no let me see let's let's let's try a
[53:40] sheep let's try a lamb there are no
[53:43] guessing God told him exactly what he
[53:47] required he has told you exactly what
[53:50] you he requires of you it's not a guess
[53:52] well if I hope I live good enough to go
[53:54] in the
[53:55] rapture
[53:57] you ain't going
[53:59] to there ain't no guessing friends God
[54:02] tells you exactly what he wants you to
[54:04] do and you go do that and then you say I
[54:06] am pleasing
[54:11] God be more me to do and I'm pleasing
[54:13] him while I do it don't let Satan talk
[54:16] you into becoming more religious because
[54:18] you feel like you're everyday
[54:21] walk you're just kind of non-spiritual I
[54:23] just go I work I take care of what are
[54:25] you looking for yeah that's
[54:30] right what super spiritual thing do you
[54:33] think you need to be doing tell me
[54:35] what's more spiritual than pleasing
[54:39] God tell me what's more spiritual than
[54:41] walking in faith doing he told you to
[54:43] do God never revealed to
[54:46] Cain he said what Cain had an excuse no
[54:48] he didn't he could have waited Cain
[54:51] didn't wait until he had a clear-cut
[54:53] decision he said well what if God didn't
[54:55] come to Cain and tell him then he could
[54:56] have watched and what see what Abel did
[54:59] and he see this is what I accept if and
[55:01] he didn't God come to a to Cain and said
[55:04] if you would do what Abel did I'll
[55:05] accept you look at that attitude to
[55:08] serpent seed and God so loved the world
[55:10] that he would even say I know your
[55:12] serpent se but Cain you didn't choose to
[55:14] be that and I'm
[55:15] G give you a chance how do you treat
[55:21] Sinners
[55:22] oh right how do we treat them oh that
[55:26] old dirty old nasty
[55:28] person it's not how Jesus treated him
[55:30] you know he go you know he had the
[55:32] hardest time with the religious
[55:34] folks the one sitting in message pews
[55:37] with that Pharisee attitude look how
[55:39] holy I
[55:41] am God's will humbles
[55:44] us he humbles us and all all all Ken had
[55:47] to do was sit there and wait and and
[55:49] wait and pray and he's waiting and then
[55:50] he sees Abel accept he said well okay
[55:52] that must be it let me go get a sheep
[55:54] hey hey Abel can I can I borrow one your
[55:57] lambs of
[55:59] course he would have been accepted but
[56:01] he couldn't do that he couldn't do it
[56:03] his nature was
[56:06] wrong humbles
[56:09] us this is a quote from Brother Brams he
[56:13] said this other morning I said to the
[56:15] wife he said I'm already 50 honey if I
[56:17] do anything for the Lord I got to
[56:20] hurry sounds pretty good doesn't it she
[56:23] said Bill God trained Moses years and
[56:26] said he can train you for another 50
[56:29] years to get one day service from
[56:31] you
[56:35] oh sassy
[56:39] wife said he's got a purpose for you so
[56:43] just stand
[56:48] still I thought that's a lot of
[56:51] wisdom God gave him the right
[56:54] wife he said don't get ahead of God
[56:57] don't go try to do something just stand
[56:59] still God got a purpose for you and when
[57:01] he wants you to do it you'll do it don't
[57:03] get ahead of well I got a gift to do
[57:05] this I got a gift to do that good when
[57:07] God wants to put it in action in It
[57:09] season he'll put you in action when he
[57:11] wants to use that gift he he'll do that
[57:13] when he wants you to sing a special
[57:14] he'll put you up there to sing a special
[57:17] whatever it is that he wants you to do
[57:18] just wait for him and do the way he does
[57:21] it it's too simple friends it's too
[57:24] simple we got to do something I said I
[57:26] thought that's a lot of wisdom stand
[57:28] still God moves every hand just
[57:30] according to his great plan just be S be
[57:33] still
[57:34] don't try to
[57:37] push you get ahead of him then it's a
[57:39] whole lot better to try to foul him than
[57:41] the lead because he's the leader don't
[57:43] try to push don't try to accomplish
[57:44] something well there's got to be a third
[57:46] pull
[57:47] there there's got to be more
[57:50] God brings that to pass in its season
[57:53] every seed has a season friend
[57:56] that's right think about this let me get
[57:58] off my subject just a little bit in in
[58:00] season every seed will come forth in its
[58:03] season if it comes in a different time
[58:05] it will die that's why you brothers and
[58:07] sisters you mom and dads you keep
[58:09] praying for your kids because in season
[58:11] that seed is going to come to life you
[58:13] can't make it happen you can't preach
[58:15] him into it you can't pray him into it
[58:17] but in season that seed that's in there
[58:20] were gonna come to life right when it's
[58:22] supposed to and if you just keep
[58:24] prodding and prodding and prodding it's
[58:26] not going to because they're just going
[58:27] to resist but you will put it in God's
[58:29] hand and say God I claim that I I put
[58:32] the token over them they are going to
[58:34] come because they are mine and you gave
[58:36] them to me and you just hide and watch
[58:40] and they're going to come into life one
[58:43] day that's all it is friend you got it's
[58:45] got to be in season that goes for your
[58:47] healing that goes for deliverance
[58:49] everything else God could deliver you
[58:51] for everything you want to be delivered
[58:53] from right now but he said this is not
[58:55] the SE
[58:56] I'm going to wait six more months for
[58:58] you to walk in faith and then I'm going
[59:00] to bring it
[59:01] to
[59:05] pass excuse me a
[59:12] second friends it's in season look at
[59:15] yourself look at how many of us how many
[59:16] of us were out in the world running here
[59:18] and running there finding just misery
[59:20] misery misery then all of a sudden one
[59:22] time something got a hold of us and it
[59:23] starts dragging us here and dragging us
[59:25] there and in season that seed came to
[59:28] life and here you
[59:30] said now how did that happen because you
[59:33] got religious were you going out there
[59:34] serving the devil and one day say you
[59:36] know what Satan I'm tired of you let me
[59:38] go serve Christ now oh no you never you
[59:40] never sought God at all God sought you
[59:43] he came and found you in that place you
[59:44] are and just because you might not have
[59:46] been in the world you still need a
[59:49] Salvation just like the rest of us maybe
[59:51] even more because you thought you were
[59:53] pretty good but you weren't you were
[59:55] just as rotten as the rest TR of us and
[59:57] God came there and he dragg you out of
[59:58] that and you look back and say God look
[1:00:00] where I was at down there in that cess
[1:00:02] pool of the world and you came all the
[1:00:04] way down there to get me out now can you

[1:00:21] much that's what he did except it worse
[1:00:25] than that

[1:00:34] man and he had all the sins think of
[1:00:40] every sin you've ever done and how

[1:01:22] abide there God will use you if you try
[1:01:24] to step over and do something something
[1:01:26] else you'll find yourself wrecked up

[1:02:12] unto them when you have lifted up the
[1:02:13] son of man then shall you know that I am
[1:02:15] he and that I do nothing of myself but
[1:02:19] as of as my father hath taught me I
[1:02:21] speak these
[1:02:22] things Jesus himself that body walking
[1:02:25] to there did not do anything on his own
[1:02:28] he waited until it was revealed to him
[1:02:29] of the father what he should do the holy
[1:02:31] spirit said come and said say this say
[1:02:33] this do this do this and he waited until

[1:03:30] many believed on him ain't that amazing
[1:03:32] they believed on him then said Jesus to
[1:03:35] those Jews which believed on him go
[1:03:37] ahead and put yourself in that to those
[1:03:39] message Believers you heard the message

[1:03:50] truth the big question is are you going
[1:03:53] to continue he brought you this far he
[1:03:55] promised to take you the rest of the way
[1:03:56] he said whatever he started he's going
[1:03:58] to finish we're going to believe that
[1:03:59] we're just going to keep walking like
[1:04:00] that are we going to try to push ahead
[1:04:02] of him said I just don't feel very
[1:04:04] spiritual anymore I just need a little
[1:04:05] bit more I just need another what do you
[1:04:07] need
[1:04:09] more what do you need
[1:04:13] more look friends once you're born
[1:04:16] again quit worrying about if you're born
[1:04:20] again quit arguing with the devil if
[1:04:23] you're born again or not I was praying
[1:04:26] here a couple weeks ago I think I don't
[1:04:29] think I've said this here I was praying
[1:04:31] and and my prayer was something like
[1:04:33] this God if this is right if if I'm
[1:04:35] right I so sincere
[1:04:38] oh so sincere God if this is right and
[1:04:41] and I'm I'm I'm walking in the light
[1:04:43] then and he just rebu me stopped me
[1:04:45] right there he said what do you mean
[1:04:47] if yeah after all I've done for you
[1:04:50] after all I've told you after all I've
[1:04:52] spoke to you and you're sitting there if
[1:04:55] I'm right if I'm born again if he said I
[1:04:59] don't want to hear that junk out of your
[1:05:00] mouth anymore you confess what I said to
[1:05:03] you and if comes from Fear any if comes
[1:05:06] from doubt any if comes from unbelief
[1:05:08] any if comes from
[1:05:09] Hell once he has revealed it to you who
[1:05:12] you are and you go anything back on that
[1:05:14] you're
[1:05:18] backslid I I still make so
[1:05:21] many mistakes
[1:05:23] [Music]
[1:05:24] okay
[1:05:27] and what does have that have to do with
[1:05:30] it I'm sorry what you're trying to have
[1:05:32] confidence in your flesh is that what
[1:05:34] you I
[1:05:36] overcome no you didn't you just got
[1:05:38] another Spirit
[1:05:41] of Pride instead of what you were
[1:05:44] dealing
[1:05:47] with you didn't overcome anything yet
[1:05:52] dead so these people that believed him
[1:05:55] these beli they said to him they said
[1:05:57] unto him what shall we do that we might
[1:05:59] work the works of God they wanted to
[1:06:01] please God just like we all want to
[1:06:02] please God everyone wants to please God
[1:06:04] so they said Jesus what can we do to to
[1:06:07] do the works of God he gave them an
[1:06:10] answer they did not
[1:06:11] like Jesus answered said to them this is
[1:06:14] the work of God that you keep all the
[1:06:16] law that you go to the synagogue that
[1:06:18] you wear your clothes correct that you
[1:06:20] don't drink this that you do this no he
[1:06:22] didn't you don't know what he said this
[1:06:25] this is the work of
[1:06:28] God that you believe on him whom he ha
[1:06:31] sent I want a law to keep they love
[1:06:34] their law the Jews they love that law
[1:06:35] because it made them they could do
[1:06:37] something that made them feel religious
[1:06:38] and made them feel spiritual they could
[1:06:40] kind of Lord it over look at all those
[1:06:42] Sinners out there who are not living as
[1:06:44] good as I am don't even think that
[1:06:46] that's not in the message all over the
[1:06:48] place because we have the same thing
[1:06:50] that's why we're preaching this tonight
[1:06:51] because that spirit is
[1:06:54] there so that we can look down on those
[1:06:56] poor Baptists those poor Catholics those
[1:06:58] poor Amish who aren't as revelated as we
[1:07:01] are that's the wrong approach friend
[1:07:04] believe on him who he has sent he Jesus
[1:07:06] Christ and he sent a message to every
[1:07:07] age he sent a church age Messenger to
[1:07:10] that age and then under that messenger
[1:07:11] he sent a five-fold Ministry and brother
[1:07:13] and sister if you want to go in the
[1:07:14] Rapture you believe on him who he has
[1:07:16] sent which is the ministry that he sent
[1:07:17] to you and you need to know who that is
[1:07:20] and you need to know that this brother
[1:07:22] here is your pastor if you don't have
[1:07:23] that Revelation yet what are you doing
[1:07:25] here that's right if you don't have that
[1:07:27] Revelation yet where are you go what why
[1:07:29] are you doing here brother and sister
[1:07:31] you need to know that you know that God
[1:07:33] put you here because if you're not in
[1:07:34] the right Church in the right place
[1:07:36] you're not going to the Rapture anyways
[1:07:37] because God has you fing that role
[1:07:39] somewhere else you have to know what
[1:07:41] you're doing it's not a guess it's well
[1:07:43] my family goes here so I'll go here well
[1:07:45] brother and sister you need to know by
[1:07:47] Revelation where you're supposed to be
[1:07:48] who your pastor is and sit under the
[1:07:50] ministry God says and when the pastor
[1:07:52] calls someone in that God brings God
[1:07:54] puts on his heart to bring in a Ministry
[1:07:56] then be under that Ministry while he's
[1:07:58] here because it was God telling him to
[1:07:59] do
[1:08:01] it it's not a guess it's not well I just
[1:08:03] I don't like that P that preacher very
[1:08:05] well so I'm just gonna take it off this
[1:08:07] evening I'm just gonna not gonna show up
[1:08:09] or I don't like that I'm just gonna kind
[1:08:10] of Snooze back here I'm going to do
[1:08:12] something else brother and sister you do
[1:08:13] that your own Peril because you're not
[1:08:15] accepting whom he has
[1:08:17] sent I ain't bringing I I ain't bringing
[1:08:20] up P preachers and saying well you got
[1:08:22] to listen to preacher I'm just telling
[1:08:23] you God's way of doing things friend
[1:08:25] this is how he does
[1:08:29] it oh my it's just that simple the one
[1:08:33] they they they want to say God you know
[1:08:35] I want to please God but when it comes
[1:08:36] down to it they won't do an able
[1:08:38] sacrifice they want a can sacrifice so
[1:08:40] they can be exalted so they can have a
[1:08:41] little something to do with it I want to
[1:08:43] position to the church I want to do this
[1:08:44] I want people to see me this way I want
[1:08:46] to have a reputation have a great faith
[1:08:49] I I I
[1:08:51] I who cares what you want there's two
[1:08:54] people care what you want you and Satan
[1:08:57] I don't care what you want he said I got
[1:08:59] my best interest in mine you go ahead
[1:09:01] and let that eye die and watch me come
[1:09:03] on the
[1:09:05] scene that's the way you do it friends
[1:09:07] that's the way you do it let him come
[1:09:09] because who wants to see Phil I don't I
[1:09:13] want to see Jesus Christ I don't want to
[1:09:15] hear what I have to say I want to hear
[1:09:16] what he has to say
[1:09:19] oh brother and sister I want to hear
[1:09:21] what God has to say tonight and I know
[1:09:24] that he put this on my heart to bring us
[1:09:25] so I'm standing in complete confidence
[1:09:27] knowing that I am speaking what he gave
[1:09:29] me to say so I have confidence to to
[1:09:31] tell you that he will speak to your knee
[1:09:33] tonight if you would just accept him the
[1:09:35] same way he will take care of what you
[1:09:38] have need of tonight well I walked out
[1:09:40] there feeling never felt anything that's
[1:09:42] what you had need
[1:09:46] of can you accept that you needed him
[1:09:50] not to say anything to you personally
[1:09:52] tonight you needed him he needed you
[1:09:54] just to sit there in the chair and
[1:09:56] believe it anyways and have him not a
[1:09:58] wink of a revelation walked out of here
[1:10:01] that was kind of boring that's what you
[1:10:03] got that's what he wanted you to go
[1:10:05] through to see how it's going to affect
[1:10:07] you and if you get bored then that's
[1:10:09] what he had you doing tonight because
[1:10:10] tomorrow he's going to speak to you or
[1:10:13] tomorrow two days from now if you will
[1:10:14] keep the right attitude and not think
[1:10:16] well I just don't think there's anything
[1:10:18] to it whatever else you're thinking is
[1:10:20] that making sense
[1:10:22] yeah that's the hardest thing to do some
[1:10:25] time when you're sitting in church and
[1:10:27] you feel As Dead As midnight and they're
[1:10:28] around
[1:10:30] you other people are shouting and
[1:10:32] jumping and
[1:10:35] pray what about me pass me not oh
[1:10:38] General savior where is he
[1:10:42] anybody you walk out of here thinking I
[1:10:44] must be
[1:10:45] backslid well if you confess it you're
[1:10:47] right yeah walk out here and confess I
[1:10:50] must be backslid you're
[1:10:52] right you are because you confess
[1:10:55] Satan's gospel
[1:10:59] yeah I heard I heard Tim brother Tim pu
[1:11:02] say this just a couple days ago he said
[1:11:04] sometime you have red letter days
[1:11:05] sometime you have black letter
[1:11:07] days that got me sometime Jesus Christ
[1:11:11] speaks to you directly red letter and
[1:11:14] sometime you're just reading the black
[1:11:16] letters between yeah you're still
[1:11:18] reading it you're still believing do
[1:11:19] that making
[1:11:20] sense because we are not always walking
[1:11:23] on the rainbows in the top of the
[1:11:24] mountain right because where does where
[1:11:27] does change come down in the
[1:11:31] valley when you can't feel him if that
[1:11:34] anointing was on you every time all day
[1:11:36] long say what could Satan do to you he
[1:11:39] just like go away but it's when you he
[1:11:42] lets you become
[1:11:43] weak he lets you become tired he lets
[1:11:46] become sick he lets you afflict your
[1:11:47] body because when your body is sick
[1:11:49] you're not as strong mentally or
[1:11:50] spiritually
[1:11:51] either he lets the stress of Life get to
[1:11:54] you you weaken down you think oh I got
[1:11:58] to go to church I got to hear from God
[1:12:00] and you get up to go after service and
[1:12:02] it's
[1:12:05] like well friends that's Enoch's
[1:12:10] walk that's how you get in the Rapture
[1:12:13] is you just go home you go to bed you
[1:12:14] get up tomorrow morning and you do it
[1:12:17] again
[1:12:18] yeah it's that
[1:12:22] simple Jesus talking to the woman at the
[1:12:24] well John 22 he said ye worship you know
[1:12:26] not what why they had no Revelation who
[1:12:29] it was they had their own God of their
[1:12:32] imagination we know what we worship for
[1:12:34] salvation is of the Jews but the hour
[1:12:36] cometh and now is when the true
[1:12:38] worshippers shall worship the father in
[1:12:39] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:12:40] seeketh such to worship him God is a
[1:12:43] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:12:46] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:12:48] friends this is the only way to please
[1:12:50] God is worshiping spirit and Truth we
[1:12:51] get a lot of times we have a lot of
[1:12:52] spirit but we don't always have truth
[1:12:54] well we we have the message of the hour
[1:12:57] we do have the message of the hour but
[1:12:58] what has God told you personally because
[1:13:01] that to Worship in truth it must be the
[1:13:03] individual Revelation that God gave to
[1:13:05] you as an individual it's not something
[1:13:08] he revealed to your pastor not something
[1:13:09] he revealed to your husband your wife
[1:13:11] your father whoever it is it has to be
[1:13:13] your own Revelation it's not off the
[1:13:15] word it's what's been spoken but God
[1:13:17] takes that word and reveals it to you
[1:13:19] and says this is the word for you
[1:13:22] tonight that's the only way you can
[1:13:24] worship and truth because that's truth
[1:13:27] that that that word becomes part of you
[1:13:28] it becomes flesh Jesus said I am the way
[1:13:30] the truth and life why because the word
[1:13:32] had come off the page when was living in
[1:13:34] flesh that's the only way you can know
[1:13:41] truth but he also said this he answered
[1:13:44] said to them well hath Isaiah prophesied
[1:13:46] to you
[1:13:48] Hypocrites sweet Jesus calling them
[1:13:50] Hypocrites as it is written this people
[1:13:52] honth me with their lips but the heart
[1:13:54] is far from me why because with their
[1:13:56] lips they're just like hey I worship you
[1:13:58] I worship you I praise you I believe you
[1:14:00] but the heart isn't there without
[1:14:03] Revelation the heart isn't there how be
[1:14:05] it in vain they do worship me teaching
[1:14:07] for doctrines the Commandments of men
[1:14:09] because they are looking for something
[1:14:10] beyond what what what God's doing it
[1:14:12] cannot be that simple humble sacrifice
[1:14:15] that Abel had it's got to be something
[1:14:16] that CED we got to have something going
[1:14:18] on on our church we got to have
[1:14:19] something big we have to be something
[1:14:21] spiritual we have to do something that
[1:14:22] gets some
[1:14:24] attention that's just nature that's a
[1:14:26] human nature friends that's why we go
[1:14:28] that's why we go through the TR the
[1:14:29] trials we go through to kill that
[1:14:32] thing Amen Let me let me just keep going
[1:14:34] they're trying to be spiritual trying to
[1:14:36] be religious like
[1:14:38] Cain let me read this there is a place
[1:14:41] in their heart that's thirsting for
[1:14:42] something God created them to thirst but
[1:14:44] to thirst after him they try to hush
[1:14:46] that blessed holy thirst with the things
[1:14:48] of the world why you're perverting the
[1:14:50] very thing that God gives the people to
[1:14:52] thirst for him you are trying to satisfy
[1:14:54] with the things of the world it will not
[1:14:56] work it never will work anybody who's
[1:14:58] out there trying to serve the things of
[1:15:00] the world and you have a seat of God in
[1:15:01] you you know that you cannot satisfy
[1:15:04] that thirst it's just
[1:15:08] impossible and then if the devil can't
[1:15:10] get you to do that to try to satisfy
[1:15:13] that thirst with the
[1:15:14] world he gets you to just get put your
[1:15:18] name on a church book and call yourself
[1:15:20] a Christian the devil gets you to do
[1:15:23] that
[1:15:26] he tries to satisfy it with that but
[1:15:28] there is no satisfaction until God
[1:15:30] himself comes into the heart to control
[1:15:32] and to satisfy the people and bless them
[1:15:34] and give them the things that created in
[1:15:36] their heart he wants to fill that space
[1:15:37] there's nothing in the world that will
[1:15:38] fill that don't you all never forget
[1:15:40] that so brother and sister what Satan
[1:15:42] does is when he says he he sees he can't
[1:15:44] keep you out of church he sees you're
[1:15:46] sincere about serving God then he going
[1:15:48] to take it he's gonna push you on past
[1:15:49] it he's going to push you on past just a
[1:15:52] simple walk like Enoch just a simple
[1:15:54] walk in faith and he going to but you
[1:15:56] need to start doing this you need to
[1:15:57] become more holy you need to start maybe
[1:16:00] maybe you wear your wear your skirts two
[1:16:01] inches longer just to show how holy you
[1:16:04] are maybe brother you should cut your
[1:16:05] hair just a half an inch shorter just to
[1:16:07] show how holy you are maybe you should
[1:16:09] do you know I'm going to start praying
[1:16:11] four more hours a week just to show how
[1:16:14] holy I
[1:16:15] am I'm G start putting a lot more in the
[1:16:18] offering just to show how holy I am just
[1:16:21] to show how sincere I
[1:16:23] am
[1:16:27] Cain
[1:16:30] worship God does not accept that at
[1:16:33] all he said but it's good it's
[1:16:36] not but they're doing better no they're
[1:16:38] not they're being deceived legalistic
[1:16:42] Spirits deceiving those people to think
[1:16:44] that well if I just try a little bit
[1:16:46] harder don't try a little bit
[1:16:48] harder it's simple faith and don't try
[1:16:51] to work up Faith that's just something
[1:16:53] in your mind it's why God has told you
[1:16:55] well God hasn't spoke to me for a while
[1:16:57] well the last time he spoke to you is
[1:16:59] where you need to be standing
[1:17:02] then see the light in the path and the
[1:17:05] next step you take that step another
[1:17:06] light you take another step and if
[1:17:08] there's no light then stand still until
[1:17:10] you see the next
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:14] light it's the hardest thing you can do
[1:17:16] friends is fight this
[1:17:18] battle it's not easy it's you say well
[1:17:22] brother s brother it seems so simp it's
[1:17:24] like this it's simple it's not easy that
[1:17:27] make sense yeah it's very simple it's
[1:17:30] not complicated but just go try do it
[1:17:32] some time it's the greatest battle ever
[1:17:35] fought right it's like this and you have
[1:17:38] a you have an algebra equation you know
[1:17:39] covers half the have the wall and I look
[1:17:42] at that said I am clueless give me two
[1:17:44] plus two four I can do
[1:17:47] simple but then he says okay now there's
[1:17:49] a 100 pound bag of sand I need you to
[1:17:52] carry that for a mile h
[1:17:55] that's
[1:17:57] difficult that's what it is to actually
[1:17:59] walk in this is difficult but it's
[1:18:01] simple the whole idea is simple just
[1:18:03] pick it up and
[1:18:04] walk and then you finally get it done
[1:18:06] and he said now pick up
[1:18:10] two you ain't never going to be done
[1:18:12] friends we're never going to get easy it
[1:18:14] never gets to the place oh I got this
[1:18:16] all wrapped up no you do not you're in a
[1:18:18] bad place if you think you got it all
[1:18:20] figured
[1:18:23] out
[1:18:25] David he tried to he tried to do God a
[1:18:28] service without it being his will you've
[1:18:29] heard that message I'm sure many times
[1:18:32] DAV could not just be satisfied being
[1:18:34] King he had to try to get
[1:18:36] spiritual let's see what brother random
[1:18:38] says about
[1:18:41] this he said we see here that David done
[1:18:44] in the scripture reading of first Chron
[1:18:45] intentions were
[1:18:49] good God does not give us merits on Good
[1:18:52] Intentions that's right
[1:18:55] but God I'm trying I don't
[1:18:58] care he don't care about your
[1:19:01] intentions that's
[1:19:04] not
[1:19:06] Faith it's not been revealed he says
[1:19:09] there's only one way to serve God that's
[1:19:10] by doing his will at his command that's
[1:19:12] all it is that's the way to do his will
[1:19:14] that's how you please God is do his will
[1:19:16] when he tells you
[1:19:18] to do
[1:19:22] it another thing David here we see in
[1:19:25] his heart he wanted to do something that
[1:19:26] was good he had no bad something for the
[1:19:29] Lord check your motive and
[1:19:32] objective that's a good place to start
[1:19:35] David had a good motive and good
[1:19:37] objective and it wasn't
[1:19:40] enough just because you want to do
[1:19:42] something that's good does not mean it's
[1:19:44] God's
[1:19:45] will you know what David did not do he
[1:19:48] did not do what Jesus said to do to work
[1:19:51] the works of God believe on him whom he
[1:19:53] has sent because consulted with the
[1:19:55] priest with the military with the
[1:19:57] captains with all the neighbors
[1:19:58] everybody you know he did not consent
[1:20:00] with cons consult with the one whom God
[1:20:04] has
[1:20:04] s Nathan the prophet and if you would
[1:20:08] have gone to there that never would have
[1:20:09] happened and Nathan would have told him
[1:20:11] what to do but you got to go to the
[1:20:13] ministry that God gives you and if you
[1:20:14] don't you're just winging it you're just
[1:20:17] winging
[1:20:18] it don't do
[1:20:21] that one great thing about God he's not
[1:20:24] left now without knowing what the truth
[1:20:26] and how to do it he wouldn't be just to
[1:20:28] punish us for doing something that we
[1:20:29] didn't know how to get how it was going
[1:20:31] to be done and just let us stumble into
[1:20:33] something he's not that kind of a god
[1:20:35] he's a God that speaks the word and
[1:20:37] expects his children to believe it so he
[1:20:39] said he does not just leave it up to us
[1:20:41] I try it go see what happens and if
[1:20:42] you're wrong I'm gonna punish you that's
[1:20:44] not the kind of God is he he doesn't got
[1:20:48] you he doesn't play gotcha look at you
[1:20:51] over there trying to be a Christian got
[1:20:52] it wrong gotcha go to hell
[1:20:55] that ain't the way he does it friends he
[1:20:56] tells us exactly we can know exactly
[1:20:59] where we are with him at any time we
[1:21:02] know what we're supposed to be
[1:21:05] doing hang on a second I got to find
[1:21:09] a no matter how sincere what good
[1:21:11] motives and what good objectives and
[1:21:13] what how people want things done they
[1:21:14] see the need of it there is a will of
[1:21:16] God to be carried out in these things
[1:21:18] that's why they want to drive down
[1:21:20] right tight for I want to make this so
[1:21:22] you have have to see it in if the spirit
[1:21:24] of God dwells in you that's the reason
[1:21:25] I'm lingering so long no matter how much
[1:21:27] it's needed how much everybody agrees
[1:21:29] that it's needed how much that that is
[1:21:31] the
[1:21:32] truth yet there's one thing to find out
[1:21:35] is that the will of
[1:21:39] God brother and sister sometime the
[1:21:41] pastor has to put up with brother Thomas
[1:21:43] I think we should do this brother Thomas
[1:21:44] I think we should do that or maybe go to
[1:21:45] the Deacon say Brothers I think we
[1:21:47] should do that and brothers I think we
[1:21:48] should do that and then nothing's
[1:21:49] happened and say well no one listens to
[1:21:51] me well maybe you're not doing what
[1:21:53] you're supposed to be doing because it's
[1:21:54] not the position you've been called
[1:21:56] to
[1:22:00] oo
[1:22:02] oh the papers even fell off after
[1:22:08] that God has offices that he works
[1:22:11] through friends yes you don't know
[1:22:14] what's going on you don't know what
[1:22:15] brother Thomas is looking at well I
[1:22:17] think we should do this brother Thomas
[1:22:18] brother let's pray about it well I think
[1:22:21] it's a good idea not saying it's not is
[1:22:24] it is it the season for
[1:22:27] it is it the person for it God has a way
[1:22:31] of doing things and sometime we just got
[1:22:33] to swallow our pride and say okay
[1:22:34] brother Thomas I'm trusting you
[1:22:36] leadership the holy
[1:22:40] spirit it's true
[1:22:48] friends and on every religious thing
[1:22:51] they could is the David probably put out
[1:22:53] advertisement and everything great
[1:22:55] Revival the ark is going to be brought
[1:22:56] back we're going to have a Revival we're
[1:22:58] going to do this he sent singers people
[1:23:00] with hars with trumpets they' done every
[1:23:01] religious thing they knew how to do and
[1:23:03] still God was not in it somewhat what we
[1:23:05] see repeating again don't we let me just
[1:23:09] be a little raw we see that all over the
[1:23:11] message now we see people they're trying
[1:23:13] to work something up they have these
[1:23:14] great meetings they have all let's come
[1:23:16] to this church because we got this going
[1:23:17] on let's go to that church they got that
[1:23:19] going on and it's all these things and
[1:23:20] what are they doing they're doing
[1:23:23] things that are necessary producing
[1:23:26] Christ is just producing another Revival
[1:23:29] so to
[1:23:30] speak does that makeing
[1:23:32] sense you FOC they're they're focusing
[1:23:35] on the wrong thing we're going to get to
[1:23:36] that in a little
[1:23:40] bit they took all the singers they took
[1:23:43] heart players the trumpet blowers the
[1:23:44] women the men whoever it was that sang
[1:23:46] they took them they done all there and
[1:23:47] they went through every religious motion
[1:23:49] I don't want to say this but I got to
[1:23:51] say it so as these denominations they
[1:23:53] Pentecostal and all is going through
[1:23:55] every religious motion of singing and
[1:23:59] shouting it's necessary that we sing and
[1:24:01] we shout and worship but that if that's
[1:24:03] what you're focusing on you're missing
[1:24:05] out on your day in this message we
[1:24:08] need to recognize our day in this
[1:24:11] message and the seed for this
[1:24:14] season we got to have the right word in
[1:24:17] the season David shouted with all his
[1:24:19] might he screamed he jumped he went
[1:24:20] through every religious motion there
[1:24:21] could be and still God was not his
[1:24:24] motive his objecting everything was
[1:24:25] right but he went wrong way with
[1:24:29] it just being religious friends ain't
[1:24:31] going to get it well I go to church and
[1:24:33] I praise and I worship that's
[1:24:36] wonderful but are you born again to
[1:24:38] begin with that's what you got to have
[1:24:41] without being born again you're wasting
[1:24:43] your
[1:24:48] time now let's see what happened
[1:24:51] allthough the religious emotional stuff
[1:24:52] was great their intention was great
[1:24:54] their Crusade was great their singing
[1:24:55] was great their dancing was great their
[1:24:57] shouting was great their music was great
[1:24:59] and they had the ark the ark is a type
[1:25:01] of the word they had the word and they
[1:25:03] had everything they have a need for they
[1:25:04] have a need for this revival we got to
[1:25:06] get the word back so people can can
[1:25:08] console with God everything was exactly
[1:25:11] right except for one
[1:25:13] thing it wasn't God's will to do it then
[1:25:16] and that
[1:25:19] way they had the ark listen to what he
[1:25:22] says what goods the ark without God it's
[1:25:26] just a wooden box a couple tables of
[1:25:29] stone and let me just say this what good
[1:25:31] is this book without the revelation of
[1:25:34] it it's just a piece of paper and
[1:25:37] leather this will do nothing but send
[1:25:39] you to hell it's going to condemn you to
[1:25:41] hell if you don't get the revelation of
[1:25:42] this word for yourself
[1:25:45] personally I read the Bible every day so
[1:25:47] does the devil goodness sakes if he
[1:25:49] needs to he needs to friend you got to
[1:25:53] have the it's got to be Faith by faith
[1:25:56] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:25:57] God so all the religious acts we do well
[1:25:59] I read my Bible and pray every day
[1:26:01] because brother Brown said a Christian
[1:26:02] does that is doing you absolutely no
[1:26:08] good if you only reading the Bible and
[1:26:11] praying because
[1:26:13] brother said a Christian does that then
[1:26:16] you have the wrong
[1:26:19] witness Jesus said I don't even accept
[1:26:22] John's witness I have a greater witness
[1:26:24] than John there he was John that great
[1:26:26] man the greatest man that ever was until
[1:26:28] that time BR Jesus said there's never
[1:26:29] never been a greater prophet and yet
[1:26:31] Jesus said his witness is not
[1:26:34] enough you cannot take a person's
[1:26:36] witness you cannot take someone else's
[1:26:38] idea you cannot take a well brother
[1:26:40] Thomas says I'm born again so I'm born
[1:26:42] again brother Thomas wouldn't do that
[1:26:43] unless God told him to but brother and
[1:26:45] sister that's not going to be enough
[1:26:46] because when you come up against Satan
[1:26:48] and you said well brother Thomas said he
[1:26:49] gonna say I don't care what brother
[1:26:51] Thomas said what about you you have to
[1:26:53] know what personally for
[1:26:57] yourself you got to have a greater
[1:27:01] witness brother brand told said to do
[1:27:04] this and that you need a greater witness
[1:27:05] you got to do it because God told you to
[1:27:07] do
[1:27:10] it I know that don't go over sometime
[1:27:13] with a lot of people but brother and
[1:27:14] sister you you have to be able to stand
[1:27:17] on the revelation God gave you
[1:27:23] personally thank it's just a wooden
[1:27:32] box so what is pleasing what is the day
[1:27:36] what is our day in this message let me
[1:27:37] let me get over this about 15 minutes
[1:27:39] and try to be done I don't want to keep
[1:27:41] you
[1:27:41] alone brother Ram says this he said now
[1:27:44] don't just don't interpret nothing if
[1:27:47] God wants you to know anything he'll
[1:27:49] send it to you
[1:27:51] see there it is
[1:27:55] friends don't try to interpret something
[1:27:58] you know some time we sit around we
[1:28:00] fellowship and you you see you know
[1:28:01] sometime we try to show how spiritual we
[1:28:03] are by the the the way we can quote and
[1:28:05] the things we can see and we try to
[1:28:07] impress people especially
[1:28:11] preachers he'll send it to you he said
[1:28:13] so just be real real solid now hold
[1:28:16] still something has happened and now
[1:28:18] just be

[1:28:22] don't put on some kind of religious
[1:28:23] feather just be

[1:28:28] he said you
[1:28:30] Christ because you take yourself away
[1:28:33] from God Don't Make Yourself weird don't
[1:28:36] make yourself odd the
[1:28:39] holy spirit will make you odd enough let
[1:28:43] it do it but don't go and try to be
[1:28:44] weirder OD or different let's see how
[1:28:46] religious I am you you God in there just

[1:28:56] right I ain't got time all a sudden they

[1:29:01] especially if they find out you're a
[1:29:03] preacher

[1:29:17] other day see then just remember
[1:29:19] there'll be no impersonation like there
[1:29:21] was of the other two now what's he
[1:29:22] saying he said don't try to produce the
[1:29:25] third

[1:30:10] time did he preach how many times did he
[1:30:13] raise the dead how many times did he

[1:30:17] hear anything at all his testimony was
[1:30:20] he W he pleased God he walked with God
[1:30:22] he was not because he pleased God

[1:30:44] you the greatest thing is happening is
[1:30:46] happening all around us the church a
[1:30:51] book and it's it's the Lan Church age
[1:30:54] and I'm it's a long quote so I kind of
[1:30:55] chopped it up a little bit you can go
[1:30:57] read that if you want it's talking about
[1:30:58] where he's talking about the beginning
[1:31:00] of the creation of
[1:31:06] God let to's see if we recognize our day
[1:31:08] and our this message what God is looking
[1:31:11] for how do we get this Enoch walk the
[1:31:14] beginning of the creation of God that is
[1:31:15] who the Lord Jesus says he is he's the
[1:31:17] beginning of the
[1:31:18] creation God the words should be he is
[1:31:21] the beginner or author of the creation
[1:31:23] of God so he's a creator of a finished
[1:31:25] physical creation so there he was Jesus
[1:31:28] Christ and he created everything let
[1:31:30] there be let there be and it's a
[1:31:31] finished creation the old creation right
[1:31:34] then what is this new creation the
[1:31:36] beginning of the creation of God is
[1:31:37] talking about a new creation right but
[1:31:39] now he is standing in the midst of the
[1:31:41] church as he stands there revealing who
[1:31:44] who he is in this last age remember it's
[1:31:46] in this last age he's standing revealing
[1:31:48] who he is and one of the things he calls
[1:31:49] himself is the
[1:31:51] begning or the beginner of the creation
[1:31:53] of God he calls himself the author of
[1:31:56] the creation of God this is another
[1:31:58] creation oh I'm going to get happy this
[1:32:01] has to do with the
[1:32:03] church you say yeah he was that New
[1:32:06] Creation yes but it also has to do with
[1:32:08] the church this is a special designation
[1:32:11] of himself he is the creator of that
[1:32:14] church the Heavenly bridegroom created
[1:32:16] his own bride as a spirit of God came he
[1:32:19] came down and created in the Virgin Mary
[1:32:20] the cells from where his body was
[1:32:22] born am it was not enough for the Holy
[1:32:25] Spirit to Simply give life to a human
[1:32:27] oam supplied by Mary that would have
[1:32:29] been sinful mankind producing the body
[1:32:31] that would not have produced the last
[1:32:32] Adam of whom it was said ly body hast
[1:32:34] thou the father who prepared me God not
[1:32:37] Mary provided that body Mary was a human
[1:32:39] incubator and she carried that holy
[1:32:41] child brought him to birth brother and
[1:32:43] sisters it's like this here was Mary she
[1:32:46] was old creation but God came and he put
[1:32:48] that seed in her which was a new
[1:32:50] creation and she brought forth it was
[1:32:52] not old creation it was literally a new
[1:32:55] creation you all believe that don't you
[1:32:58] know that that's why he was not Jew he
[1:33:00] was not Gentile he was God himself a
[1:33:03] complete New Creation not part of the
[1:33:05] old creation at
[1:33:07] all but he was just the
[1:33:10] [Music]
[1:33:11] beginning oh Hallelujah there's got to
[1:33:14] be an end to it there's got to be more
[1:33:16] to it than just the
[1:33:18] [Applause]
[1:33:19] beginning he said he brought she brought
[1:33:22] forth that holy child brought him to
[1:33:23] birth it was a God man the new creation
[1:33:26] is a God
[1:33:28] man God
[1:33:31] woman he was the son of God he was of
[1:33:34] the new creation man of God met and
[1:33:36] joined he was the first of this new new
[1:33:40] race he is the head of this new race
[1:33:43] it's not a oneman race it's a many
[1:33:46] membered body race he was the alpha of
[1:33:49] this new creation this new race and
[1:33:51] there's got to be an Omega of this new
[1:33:54] race and it was dark it was Shadow it
[1:33:56] was Cloud day all the way from alpha to
[1:33:58] Omega with the evening time there shall
[1:34:01] be light this evening
[1:34:04] Tabernacle not just the name uh the even
[1:34:06] light Tabernacle not just the name of
[1:34:08] this building but it's the name of the
[1:34:10] people inside who are manifesting that
[1:34:12] there is a new creation there is
[1:34:14] something going on inside and it's in
[1:34:16] this old creation but this old creation
[1:34:18] contains a new creation and it is
[1:34:20] absolutely bringing this old creation
[1:34:22] into subjection because we must be the
[1:34:24] manifestation of that Omega creation
[1:34:27] that Omega race that is what we get to
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:34] do this age that's why the seals are
[1:34:37] open because that could produce that
[1:34:39] pure work could produce you
[1:34:42] a a complete New Creation like they had
[1:34:45] at the very beginning where the first
[1:34:47] that is this day in this message do you
[1:34:50] recognize follow the rules if I can just
[1:34:52] go to church no there is a new creation
[1:34:55] happening and you if you're born again
[1:34:57] and it's actually going to take and
[1:34:59] change this whole body one day and make
[1:35:01] this part of the new
[1:35:04] creation when he was in
[1:35:07] Mary that new creation came to came to
[1:35:10] fruition and was separated from that Old
[1:35:12] creation but in you it's not that way he
[1:35:15] put that seed in you before you were
[1:35:17] born you came to Earth with that in
[1:35:19] there and in
[1:35:21] it right season when it was the time for
[1:35:24] that creation to come to life that
[1:35:26] creation was birthed by the pure word
[1:35:29] which took you all the way back to a
[1:35:30] Justified State you never sinned in the
[1:35:33] first place your body might have your
[1:35:35] old nature might have done that but your
[1:35:37] new nature never did it it has never sin
[1:35:40] that Soul has never sinned it cannot sin
[1:35:42] it's been sealed away abolutely New
[1:35:45] Creation just like Adam was formed it's
[1:35:47] also been
[1:35:51] formed amen even more than Adam was
[1:35:55] formed out of the old creation the dust
[1:35:58] this new thing was not formed Out of the
[1:36:00] Dust it was formed out of the spoken
[1:36:02] word of God it was a complete new
[1:36:04] creation and it's going to stay in there
[1:36:07] until it's time to bring the rest of
[1:36:08] this creation to
[1:36:11] place that that's what we're doing
[1:36:15] here that's what we're doing that's what
[1:36:18] it means to walk like Enoch walk because
[1:36:21] what more can you ask for than that what
[1:36:23] more than just know that as I walk
[1:36:25] through my life I am a new creation and
[1:36:28] here I walk and
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:32] Satan hates
[1:36:34] me can't stop me creation because he has
[1:36:38] no no hold on it he still has a hold on
[1:36:44] this
[1:36:47] flesh never touched that new creation he
[1:36:50] has nothing to touch it
[1:36:52] with
[1:36:54] throw that in his face when it comes
[1:36:56] against you take him just push that in
[1:36:58] his face and saying I want you to know
[1:37:00] something I am a new creation and I know
[1:37:02] it and God knows it and now you know it
[1:37:06] too he recognizes Faith he backs down
[1:37:10] for Faith you want to walk with faith
[1:37:12] you want to please God you keep walking
[1:37:14] like that and he will back down in front
[1:37:16] of you because he cannot stand in the
[1:37:19] face of real
[1:37:22] faith
[1:37:27] now try to produce
[1:37:29] that try to produce a new creation go
[1:37:33] ahead someone stand up and create
[1:37:35] something see how ridiculous it is when
[1:37:37] we get ahead of God when we try to do
[1:37:39] something well I'm gonna try to be more
[1:37:40] religious I'm gonna try to be more
[1:37:42] spiritual create something that's that's
[1:37:44] the message of this hour is that you are
[1:37:46] a new creation that's what the
[1:37:51] seals open for that's what the message
[1:37:53] so the pure seed and that's what it
[1:38:03] produces man and God met and
[1:38:08] joined he was the first of this new race
[1:38:11] he is the head of this new race
[1:38:14] Colossians 1:18 he is the head of the
[1:38:15] body of the church who was beginning the
[1:38:17] first born from the dead that in all
[1:38:18] things he I have
[1:38:19] preeminence there you can see that
[1:38:21] though man was of the old order or
[1:38:23] creation Now in Union with Christ he has
[1:38:25] become the new creation of God Ephesians
[1:38:27] 2:10 for we are his workmanship created
[1:38:29] in Union with Christ Jesus unto good
[1:38:31] works Ephesians 4:24 and he that and
[1:38:33] that he put I'm sorry and that ye put on
[1:38:35] the new man which after God has created
[1:38:38] in righteousness and true Holiness look
[1:38:39] look friends that's why that's why when
[1:38:41] the seals were open they didn't had to
[1:38:43] write more to this it's all in there it
[1:38:46] was all in there look at Paul saying all
[1:38:48] these things about new creation and yet
[1:38:50] Paul didn't have the same understanding
[1:38:52] we do because of the books had book
[1:38:54] hadn't been open opened yet ain't that
[1:38:57] amazing it was not the season for it
[1:39:00] this is the season for it for us to
[1:39:02] realize who we
[1:39:05] are oh when not the old creation made
[1:39:07] over or it could not be called a new
[1:39:09] creation this is exactly what it says it
[1:39:11] is New Creation it's
[1:39:13] another creation distinct from the old
[1:39:16] one no longer is he dealing by ways of
[1:39:18] the
[1:39:19] flesh but now out of every Kindred tribe
[1:39:21] and Nation he has purposed a new
[1:39:23] creation he is the first of that
[1:39:24] creation he was God created in the form
[1:39:26] of
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:28] man do you see what the new race is is
[1:39:31] God created in the form of man be
[1:39:36] recognized who you are
[1:39:39] iare no I don't think that I know I
[1:39:44] am man that's who the prophet said Do
[1:39:47] you believe our
[1:39:49] Prophet then he said you are a God man
[1:39:52] you are a god God
[1:39:55] woman you are God and man God and woman
[1:39:58] United in a way that hasn't been done
[1:40:00] since the alpha
[1:40:06] bride Now by his Spirit he's creating
[1:40:09] many sons into himself God the Creator
[1:40:11] creating himself a part of his cre this
[1:40:13] is the true revelation of God this was
[1:40:15] his purpose this purpose took form
[1:40:19] through election oh my election there it
[1:40:23] is is you didn't even get to
[1:40:26] choose he didn't even depend on your
[1:40:29] choice by his own decree he elected the
[1:40:32] members of this new creation he
[1:40:35] predestinate them to the adoption of
[1:40:37] children according to the good pleasure
[1:40:38] of his will not your will he wasn't
[1:40:41] depending on your will he was oh I sure
[1:40:43] hope brother Thomas is choose right
[1:40:45] because I want him to be part of my
[1:40:46] right come on brother Thomas I sent
[1:40:47] someone to preach get come no no he said
[1:40:49] when that time for that seed to come to
[1:40:52] life there's no devil in hell could keep
[1:40:54] it from
[1:40:56] coming because in It season it's going
[1:40:58] to come to life every one of you every
[1:41:01] one of us in It season it comes to life
[1:41:02] and you can look back and you can see
[1:41:04] look at the difference in my
[1:41:06] life this just explains it all friends
[1:41:11] yes well God does not just want
[1:41:13] fellowship with
[1:41:17] you under the blood all right you better
[1:41:22] you better explain that one
[1:41:23] [Laughter]
[1:41:28] before under the blood of bulls and
[1:41:29] goats God got a fellowship from a
[1:41:31] distance because the sin was
[1:41:36] covered under the blood of Jesus
[1:41:39] Christ true fellow that Union but then
[1:41:43] when the bride started
[1:41:45] mix the word down through the church
[1:41:48] ages he couldn't marry
[1:41:50] her that's right all the way down he
[1:41:52] couldn't marri her because she still had
[1:41:54] false seed that's why the seals had to
[1:41:57] be open because it brought pure
[1:41:59] seed and then it was no more two they
[1:42:03] become one yeah it's like it's like a
[1:42:05] man and woman you're married right
[1:42:07] you're one but there's two
[1:42:09] bodies that's down through the church
[1:42:12] ages it ain't that way
[1:42:14] anymore there's not two anymore you're
[1:42:17] one you can live brother Bram said you
[1:42:19] can live such a life that Satan can't
[1:42:21] find you all he seus
[1:42:24] Christ this so this so flesh needs to
[1:42:27] die doesn't
[1:42:28] it to get our buttons
[1:42:32] pushed it's like this you could bake a
[1:42:35] cake right you have eggs you have flour
[1:42:37] you have bacing soda you have chocolate
[1:42:39] you have chocolate whatever you're G to
[1:42:40] put in there right you have all these
[1:42:42] different ingredients mix them together
[1:42:44] and bake it find the individual
[1:42:48] ingredients you can it's
[1:42:52] one let me put it this way now during
[1:42:54] the church let's say you had two pieces
[1:42:56] of iron and you're gonna M weld them
[1:43:01] together but you can still see where the
[1:43:03] weld is this is where they old one piece
[1:43:07] this the throw them back in the
[1:43:11] furnace and they melt down together you
[1:43:14] pull them out find the individual
[1:43:19] iron and the great part about this in
[1:43:21] this day he did not use two old people
[1:43:23] pieces of iron he he created two new
[1:43:26] ones the word for this day manifest in
[1:43:30] flesh creating Christ in you the hope of
[1:43:34] glory that's what it is when when
[1:43:36] brother BR preached Christ is the
[1:43:38] mystery of God revealed put yourself in
[1:43:40] that word you are the mystery of God
[1:43:44] revealed he say oh brother Phil that's
[1:43:47] really pushing it no it's not you are
[1:43:49] the Christ in this day if you are the
[1:43:51] Living Word in this day you are Christ
[1:43:54] in this day you're not the one we pray
[1:43:55] to but that the Living Word Christ is
[1:43:58] the Living Word that's who you are
[1:43:59] friends you are the Living Word in this
[1:44:02] day a new creation a new
[1:44:07] race and all he wants you to do is
[1:44:12] walk what greater thing can you have
[1:44:15] than that well brother Phil Phil I
[1:44:18] perform Miracles I've raised the dead
[1:44:19] I've healed the sick I'm a new
[1:44:22] creation what's greater because false
[1:44:25] anointed ones can heal the sick and
[1:44:26] raise the dead and preach and shout and
[1:44:28] everything else and completely go to
[1:44:30] hell but if you're part of a new
[1:44:31] creation you can't go to
[1:44:33] hell you can't you're
[1:44:40] Christ let me finish
[1:44:43] up elected to
[1:44:46] this God Witnesses
[1:44:49] it God Witnesses testifies that you
[1:44:52] please pleas
[1:44:54] him because if he wouldn't please with
[1:44:57] you he'd tell you to do something
[1:45:00] different ain't that right brother
[1:45:03] bandam said he doesn't let you just
[1:45:04] stumble along without telling us exactly
[1:45:06] what he wants so if he wants you to be
[1:45:08] doing
[1:45:09] some else he'll come to you say brother
[1:45:11] Caleb I want you to do this I want you
[1:45:12] do that and Caleb's gonna do it but as
[1:45:14] long as he's not telling you to do
[1:45:14] something different you just keep
[1:45:15] walking the way he told you to walk it's
[1:45:18] too simple it's just too
[1:45:21] simple
[1:45:23] so do you recognize our day our
[1:45:27] message we are the manifestation of
[1:45:30] it now I got one more thing to say and
[1:45:32] this might get a little
[1:45:39] raw do we really believe what I just
[1:45:44] said let me ask you something I know
[1:45:47] this can't happen but just play along
[1:45:48] with me what if you knew Jesus Christ
[1:45:51] was going to walk through that door
[1:45:53] and come to church
[1:45:56] tonight the body that was crucified he's
[1:46:00] going to walk through you and you knew
[1:46:01] that brother Thomas put out the word hey
[1:46:02] everybody Jesus Christ in flesh is gonna
[1:46:05] be in the church
[1:46:06] tonight would you have come with a
[1:46:08] different
[1:46:10] attitude would you have dressed
[1:46:12] different would you have been more
[1:46:15] sincere that's
[1:46:17] good if you believe what I preached he
[1:46:21] did he walked through that
[1:46:25] door he every time that door opens he
[1:46:27] walks through that door every time you
[1:46:29] have church Jesus Christ in flesh walks
[1:46:31] through that
[1:46:32] door that's right how do you treat
[1:46:37] him how do you treat
[1:46:39] him because if you would treat that
[1:46:43] body if you would treat that body
[1:46:45] different than you treat him here you're
[1:46:47] a respector of
[1:46:49] persons you're sinning a great sin
[1:46:53] that brother and sister well I don't
[1:46:54] know if they had the holy ghost or not
[1:46:56] well that shows that you probably need
[1:46:57] it
[1:46:58] yourself that hurts but brother and
[1:47:00] sister that's your attitude you're gonna
[1:47:01] treat them different just because maybe
[1:47:03] they don't that's the way you treat
[1:47:06] Sinners how did Jesus treat
[1:47:09] Sinners Judas son of
[1:47:12] predition let's have a last supper sit
[1:47:14] beside me
[1:47:17] Judas yeah Judas come to the Garden of
[1:47:20] Gethsemane friend you think he meant
[1:47:23] that yeah or was he a
[1:47:27] hypocrite he treated Judas the same way
[1:47:29] he treated everyone else and so he said
[1:47:31] when are you gonna betray me none of
[1:47:32] them looked ah it's Judas we knew it not
[1:47:35] a single one he did not treat him
[1:47:40] different hanging
[1:47:43] on on the cross did he love those people
[1:47:47] yeah and forgive him or was he just
[1:47:49] doing that because he was supposed
[1:47:51] to do you do it because you're supposed
[1:47:56] to or do you
[1:48:02] love great way to stop
[1:48:07] huh whatever your motive is whatever
[1:48:09] you're
[1:48:10] doing God's going to bring you to the
[1:48:12] place you need to
[1:48:14] be every one of us who are
[1:48:18] predestinated ordained to go in the
[1:48:20] Rapture is going in the Rapture and the
[1:48:22] way you're going to get there is you're
[1:48:23] going to have the same testimony God's
[1:48:24] going to testify that you are pleasing
[1:48:27] me that's what puts you there amen is
[1:48:30] that all
[1:48:51] right
[1:48:58] I had I needed I guess
[1:49:09] not brother and sister it comes down to
[1:49:12] that
[1:49:14] God takes it serious right he preaches
[1:49:18] it he tells us these wonderful things he
[1:49:20] tells us who we are but then he also
[1:49:21] holds that standard really high says now
[1:49:23] I need you to walk here but now don't
[1:49:25] don't don't go and walk there just well
[1:49:27] I'm going to try hard I'm going to try
[1:49:28] I'm going to start being nicer to my
[1:49:29] brother and sister be nice I'm not
[1:49:32] saying not to be nice but recognize
[1:49:33] that's not what he's saying it's to
[1:49:36] recognize Christ in you and recognize
[1:49:40] Christ in each other and then you're
[1:49:42] naturally it's just going to come out
[1:49:43] naturally that you start treating people
[1:49:45] the way you should treat them you're
[1:49:46] going to start treating because you
[1:49:47] recognize that this is your nature your
[1:49:49] old Nature has gone to that new creation
[1:49:52] it just treat people that way it loves
[1:49:53] people it tells people the truth it is
[1:49:56] not rude it's not you know what I'm
[1:49:58] talking about it's just it's just a
[1:49:59] person that it just expresses God's love
[1:50:03] that's what I'm gonna say it expresses
[1:50:04] God love and brother and sisters that's
[1:50:05] all he's asking for you is die to
[1:50:08] yourself get out of the way so he can
[1:50:10] love through you so that when people see
[1:50:12] you they see
[1:50:14] Christ that's all he's looking for I I
[1:50:17] look that's what's going to put you in a
[1:50:18] Rapture amen Lord Jesus we're so
[1:50:21] grateful you would come tonight and
[1:50:24] Speak Lord Jesus I believe that I
[1:50:26] believe you had you said what you wanted
[1:50:28] to said I just pray that the word would
[1:50:30] let it have the effect that you want it
[1:50:31] to have let it anchor Let each person
[1:50:33] Lord examine it and hold on and and wait
[1:50:36] for that to sink into the heart if it's
[1:50:37] not there ready and that it can have the
[1:50:39] effect you wanted to have Lord that it
[1:50:41] does not return void but it produces
[1:50:43] Christ in flesh Lord Jesus there's
[1:50:45] nothing greater I can think of than a
[1:50:47] person to see that new creation of Jesus
[1:50:49] Christ living through them there's it's
[1:50:51] greater than any Miracles greater than
[1:50:53] any Ministry greater than anything
[1:50:56] we do is to know that we are one with
[1:51:00] you completely molded together
[1:51:02] Inseparable man and God a new race this
[1:51:06] is who we claim we are because you're
