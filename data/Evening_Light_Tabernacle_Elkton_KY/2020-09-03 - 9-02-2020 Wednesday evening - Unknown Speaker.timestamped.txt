[0:00] committed fornicator and the merchants
[0:02] of the earth are waxed rich through the
[0:04] abundance
[0:05] of her delicacies and i heard another
[0:07] voice from heaven saying
[0:09] come out of her my people that ye be not
[0:12] partakers of her sins and that you
[0:14] receive
[0:15] not of her plagues for her sins have
[0:18] reached under heaven
[0:19] and god has remembered her iniquities
[0:22] just before just before brother branham
[0:24] reads this in 1965 the god of this evil
[0:27] age he says what is it
[0:30] he said the world's heading to a climax
[0:35] heading to a climax why the spirit
[0:39] of lawlessness moral decay
[0:44] scientific religion has let it
[0:48] let it to each of every hateful
[0:53] and unclean bird and refers this to
[0:57] a absolute
[1:01] that the spirit of loneliness moral
[1:03] decay scientific religion has
[1:05] absolutely led it to this place so
[1:07] revelations 18
[1:08] this is the climactic time of religion
[1:12] amen this is the climax of religion
[1:16] this is not only the climax of religion
[1:19] but
[1:20] we should say that not just any religion
[1:23] because there's actually two
[1:24] two religions one is the devils and
[1:26] one's gods and that right
[1:28] and so this is this is the climax of of
[1:31] wrong religion
[1:33] moral decay amen now
[1:37] so now brother bam says right after that
[1:39] in the next one he says now what a
[1:41] warning he says that throws the church
[1:44] exactly back to revelations 3 14
[1:47] again to that leadership age lawlessness
[1:52] religious real religious brother man
[1:55] says
[1:56] real religious but lawlessness
[1:59] amen you know and so he says you know
[2:04] because thou sayest we are rich and have
[2:06] need of nothing no it's not that our
[2:08] naked
[2:08] miserable blind and knows it not
[2:11] perfectly with the scriptures
[2:12] of this age not the scripture for
[2:15] daniel's h or the other age of noah but
[2:17] for this last age
[2:19] amen so we see that this is a
[2:23] climactic age that we're living in we
[2:25] know that it's going there's a climax
[2:27] both for god's the religion god's faith
[2:30] god's people and also satan's religion
[2:34] and we find here that that this babylon
[2:38] is followed now how many knows that at
[2:40] one time
[2:41] uh you know we had we had
[2:44] women still do i guess but all these
[2:47] different religions of methodists
[2:52] and presbyterians and uh confusion
[2:55] right and that's what babylon was was
[2:58] confusion babylon means confusion
[3:01] you know and so but so it talks about
[3:04] balablon haven't fallen
[3:06] so to me it sounds like at one time
[3:09] babylon
[3:16] fallen yet that's exactly what a prophet
[3:18] taught us there was a time
[3:19] where even brother branham amen in his
[3:21] ministry would
[3:22] tell now finds you a good church home to
[3:24] go to there's a lot of them around here
[3:26] is that right
[3:28] amen and he would send people to the
[3:29] denominations he would send them in
[3:31] there and send them
[3:32] in there god was dealing with them god
[3:33] was working with him and so forth
[3:35] but there we all know that there was a
[3:37] great turning point in that right
[3:39] a great turning point where the the
[3:42] denominations actually
[3:43] kicked jesus out amen they cut christ
[3:46] out
[3:47] amen and after that it fell now notice
[3:50] that it actually
[3:51] fell because of disobedience now
[3:55] let me just read something else here
[4:05] the meaning i want you to i want to read
[4:07] you the meaning
[4:09] the meaning of disobedience
[4:12] okay disobedience now
[4:16] over in ephesians i want to read that
[4:18] scripture about
[4:19] the disobedience and the children of
[4:21] disobedience because brother bennett
[4:23] makes reference to this
[4:25] he says now in ephesians 2 and verse 2
[4:28] where
[4:29] in times past ye walked according to the
[4:32] course of this world according to the
[4:34] prince of the power of the air
[4:36] the spirit that now worketh in the
[4:38] children of
[4:40] disobedience all right disobedience
[4:43] now but says children of disobedience
[4:45] this is god of the civil age
[4:47] disobedience means
[4:50] rebellion i looked that up in the
[4:53] dictionary to be sure rebellion
[4:55] rebellion against what
[4:58] the revealed word of god am i right
[5:04] the revealed word of god like cain
[5:07] rebelled against abel's revealed
[5:10] revelation
[5:12] all right vindicated of god that it was
[5:15] he was righteous and cain rebelled
[5:18] against it
[5:19] and slew his brother the pharisees with
[5:22] their own denominational
[5:25] knowledge of what the word of god was
[5:27] selected hand pikmin
[5:29] rebelled against the vindicated word of
[5:32] god made manifest
[5:34] for the day jesus christ and they
[5:38] killed him amen
[5:41] so we see there but he makes a statement
[5:44] that there's only two classes of people
[5:47] spoke up in the new testament that's the
[5:49] children of god
[5:50] and the children of the devil or we
[5:52] could say the children of disobedience
[5:55] amen brother bam goes on to talk about
[5:57] that that there's
[5:58] there's only two classes and there's the
[6:00] children of obedience
[6:02] and then there's the children of
[6:04] disobedience amen or
[6:07] rebellion now i'll
[6:10] tell you what how many knows that when
[6:12] if anybody ever has a parent if you're a
[6:14] parent
[6:15] and if your child ever decides to rebel
[6:18] against you
[6:19] that's one of the worst things that a
[6:21] parent can experience
[6:22] is a rebellious child
[6:25] hey man you try to talk to them you try
[6:27] to talk loud to them you try to be nice
[6:29] to them and they just don't want nothing
[6:32] then they're gonna hear it amen they are
[6:34] not gonna listen to you they rebel
[6:36] against you
[6:37] and that is a real hard place for a
[6:40] parent to be
[6:41] is that right how many know that in the
[6:43] old testament and if a child was too
[6:45] rebellious would not do it they'd
[6:46] actually take them out and stone
[6:48] them because that's what god thinks
[6:50] about rebellion
[6:52] amen now we all know that the first
[6:54] rebellion and the first disobedience and
[6:56] rebellion that ever happened
[6:58] happened where in heaven
[7:04] the first disobedience happened in
[7:06] heaven the first rebellion
[7:08] that happened what happened in heaven
[7:10] and i can't imagine how that god must
[7:12] have felt isn't that right
[7:14] for satan to come up and two-thirds of
[7:16] the angels by the time says
[7:17] a two-third but anyway and so you you
[7:20] know for god to have to deal with and
[7:21] actually cast
[7:22] the devil out all right cast the devil
[7:25] out
[7:25] and and now here in revelations if
[7:28] you'll notice that
[7:29] in the revelation it says that
[7:34] the babylon the great is fallen and has
[7:37] become
[7:37] the habitation of devils
[7:41] amen so how many of those that's any
[7:44] spirit
[7:44] that is a spirit of rebellion
[7:48] or disobedience is the spirit of a devil
[7:54] it's an evil spirit it's a horrible
[7:57] spirit
[7:58] amen and so it's become the habitation
[8:01] of devils
[8:02] the whole of every fowl spirit and the
[8:05] cage of every unclean
[8:07] and hateful bird amen so we see
[8:11] we know that brother babe taught in the
[8:12] lineages and the two lineages he said
[8:14] there's only two
[8:15] classes of speak people spoke of
[8:17] children of god
[8:18] children of the devil we trace that back
[8:20] all the way to genesis
[8:22] and we find out that there was only two
[8:23] kinds of children one of them was the
[8:25] children
[8:26] of abel isn't that right and not the
[8:29] children of abel abel didn't have any
[8:30] children
[8:31] amen but over in genesis it talks about
[8:34] cain now i wanted to read this can i
[8:37] take my time and just read this
[8:39] let's look at these two children for a
[8:41] minute in genesis 4
[8:43] and verse 16 we'll start with and now
[8:46] cain went out from the presence of the
[8:48] lord and dwelt in the land of nod
[8:50] on the east of eden now this was after
[8:54] of course he had slew his brother
[8:56] amen and the lord came down and said
[8:57] where is abel thy brother and
[8:59] you know he says i know not am i my
[9:02] brother's keeper
[9:03] he lied right into the face of almighty
[9:06] god
[9:07] that's the audacity of satan's lineage
[9:10] is to lie
[9:12] right in his face that was the same
[9:15] kind of devil that was on the pharisees
[9:18] that looked jesus
[9:19] in the face amen and said don't we speak
[9:22] well that we say that thou art has the
[9:25] devil
[9:26] you know and so forth that dies the
[9:27] devil you know right there
[9:29] right to his face the very god they
[9:31] could raise the dead and so forth
[9:33] the pharisees had a lot of audacity
[9:34] audacious same as the cain had
[9:36] he has a lot of adapts to the let me
[9:39] tell you something the children of cain
[9:41] they have a lot of audacity
[9:43] they're not afraid to speak evil
[9:47] amen if god's people are of god even
[9:51] tread you know where they walk with hot
[9:55] nail shoes
[9:57] people they speak and that's what cain
[9:58] was he right into the
[10:00] [Music]
[10:03] god and said i don't and then of course
[10:05] cain there
[10:06] given the revelation and said look if
[10:08] you get the same revelation if you'll do
[10:10] exactly like what
[10:12] your brother did you'll be accepted
[10:15] but in the face of all of that he still
[10:19] refused he willfully
[10:22] what disobeyed
[10:26] instead of doing what god said to
[10:30] he didn't do what god said do he rebel
[10:33] how many knows that cain was the first
[10:36] rebel he was the first rebel that
[10:38] rebelled against god amen
[10:42] and so we look at that we see that in
[10:43] the lineage of canaan also
[10:46] amen this this this the beginning of it
[10:48] how that
[10:49] uh you know that's where all of this
[10:51] come from brother baby says look at cain
[10:54] you know in him was hatred in him was
[10:57] jealousy amen from jealousy with hatred
[11:00] and from hatred went to murder
[11:02] you know and so but you know i believe
[11:05] that god's children are different they
[11:06] have a different
[11:07] atmosphere about them amen especially
[11:10] when you're born again now you might be
[11:12] by nature
[11:14] children of wrath you might be that way
[11:17] but once you get the holy ghost that
[11:18] nature dies and you get a new nature
[11:21] it's completely different we see that's
[11:23] why i said
[11:24] you know you know whether you kill as
[11:26] many as what hitler did or you kill one
[11:28] you'll
[11:29] still be a murderer you know right and
[11:31] so
[11:32] cain here we see how that he uh
[11:35] how did he had this nature of rebellion
[11:39] and he goes all the way down and we find
[11:41] like rubber bands says the climactic age
[11:43] is what the age in which you are
[11:45] you and i are living in and then i'm
[11:48] gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna save time but
[11:50] it talks about how that came to his wife
[11:52] she conceived and bear enoch
[11:54] and he builded a city and called the
[11:57] name after the name of his son
[11:58] enoch all right so we see that first
[12:01] thing that brother bam says here
[12:03] is that the lineage of cain
[12:06] and what he begin to do he says
[12:10] if you'll notice there come a great
[12:12] civilization
[12:13] through that lineage of cain back there
[12:16] and they begin to come up
[12:17] men begin to multiply they begin to go
[12:20] out and get different educations and so
[12:22] forth and discovery of things if you go
[12:25] down further
[12:26] here uh jubal his he was a maker of the
[12:30] harp and the organ
[12:31] how many of them says he would make
[12:33] instruments cain's lineage is the one
[12:35] that could make instruments
[12:37] amen and boy i'll tell you what you know
[12:39] how many knows the devil one time was
[12:41] right in the presence of god so he knew
[12:42] how to worship
[12:44] the devil knew how to worship and so you
[12:46] look at rock and roll you look at what's
[12:49] out there and you look at the
[12:50] you know there's so many different kinds
[12:52] of rock there's so many different kinds
[12:54] of music
[12:55] and then then the people you have a
[12:56] concert and people will go
[12:58] absolutely wild you know right screaming
[13:01] holland doing
[13:02] all kinds of man they worship they're
[13:04] gone
[13:06] amen and so you know they really worship
[13:09] their god
[13:09] and i'll tell you what i believe we
[13:11] ought to worship our god as much as what
[13:13] they worship theirs
[13:15] that's exactly right because we've got
[13:16] something real something greater
[13:18] something better than what they have
[13:20] but yet he knew that and he does that
[13:22] that's what he does
[13:24] today he provides all of his children
[13:26] amen things like that but if you'll
[13:28] notice here
[13:29] that the lineage of caden and i want to
[13:30] talk about these
[13:32] children of disobedience and these uh
[13:34] these lawless nature of
[13:36] lawless children the children of
[13:38] lawlessness
[13:40] and their nature and what they do and
[13:42] what they lean on
[13:43] okay now notice he says and they went
[13:45] out and got all kinds of educations and
[13:47] so forth
[13:48] and it just comes to mind i didn't
[13:49] bother pulling it up but how many mo how
[13:51] many of
[13:51] the bands says education civilization
[13:54] and culture
[13:54] and and progress progress and all of
[13:57] these things
[13:58] are all of the devils
[14:02] science education all these things are
[14:05] of the devil
[14:06] amen and i i meant to bring that out how
[14:09] that you know it says that the children
[14:11] will be disobedient to parents
[14:13] now you know i i thought about saying
[14:16] this that the reason that our children
[14:18] are disobedient is because the parents
[14:21] taught them to be disobedient
[14:25] how can you say that brother about it
[14:26] because our prophet clearly said
[14:28] we wouldn't have disobedience we
[14:31] wouldn't have
[14:32] juvenile delinquency you had to have
[14:34] parent delinquency before you had
[14:36] juvenile delinquency
[14:38] he said it's parent delinquency because
[14:41] they're just little children
[14:42] and they will obey you if you make them
[14:45] is that right
[14:45] and so they taught them and they taught
[14:47] them not to whip them they taught them
[14:49] not to do this and the
[14:51] count the one two three this out of the
[14:53] other and they taught them disobedience
[14:56] amen and so that that's why they became
[14:59] that way and along with that
[15:00] all that other stuff that is written
[15:02] there was a result of them
[15:04] teaching them not to have to obey they
[15:07] they taught them this
[15:08] was disrespect and they became selfish
[15:10] in all of the things that they have
[15:11] become
[15:12] so now notice another thing it says
[15:14] listen different education science all
[15:16] this
[15:17] and discovery of things inventions
[15:21] now we read that in the fourth chapter
[15:23] of genesis where
[15:24] you know these people they became
[15:26] inventors
[15:28] they invented things they discovered
[15:31] things
[15:33] amen maybe and he says there's another
[15:36] one that was a great worker of wood and
[15:38] how they built and to begin to build and
[15:40] build and build
[15:41] and it was listen brother bound says it
[15:43] was a sign
[15:45] that the end time was near and that
[15:48] because of the building and building
[15:49] like as it was in the days of noah they
[15:51] built it they did this
[15:53] that was one of the signs that he was
[15:55] getting close to the end
[15:57] now notice and that's one thing i want
[15:58] to bring out if you'll notice
[16:00] that the children of kane they love to
[16:03] build
[16:04] cities now how many knows that when you
[16:07] look at those big cities out here
[16:08] i don't know about you but i know sons
[16:11] of god daughters of god live in those
[16:13] cities they're
[16:13] not not they can't live in them but it's
[16:15] it was something that
[16:17] you know for the most part i mean i
[16:19] believe a christian likes to be
[16:21] somewhere
[16:22] under an evergreen tree amen we love the
[16:25] mommy loves to be out in the country
[16:27] i love the country amen and that's what
[16:29] says children is brother bam said they
[16:31] were sheep
[16:32] murderers they lived out there in the
[16:34] country sheep and herod and so forth
[16:36] and it says that whenever seth
[16:40] listen it says and adam knew his wife
[16:43] again and she buried his son and called
[16:44] his name seth
[16:45] for god says he says she has appointed
[16:49] me another seed instead of abel whom
[16:51] cain slew
[16:53] so we see another seed line and to seth
[16:55] verse 26
[16:56] to him also there was born a son and he
[16:58] called his name enos
[17:01] and then began men to build cities
[17:04] to make pipe organs to be inventors
[17:07] no then men began to call on the name of
[17:11] the lord
[17:13] amen that's why i'll tell you what i
[17:16] believe that a christian doesn't rely
[17:18] they don't lean on science we don't
[17:20] leave on education
[17:22] we don't lean on progress and i don't
[17:24] think we lean
[17:25] on the lord i mean
[17:29] you release the son and daughter god we
[17:30] are leaning in it's on the law we're
[17:32] leaning on the lord
[17:33] not on all these modern things amen
[17:37] praise the lord inventions wood and so
[17:40] forth now notice
[17:41] and they were great workers of metal all
[17:44] right
[17:44] they discovered how they could do it
[17:47] with metal
[17:48] and look what they're doing with metal
[17:49] today they're even making steel
[17:52] or metal houses now how many knows that
[17:55] there's a lot of construction out there
[17:57] with metal studs and all of that
[17:58] everything metal metal
[18:00] metal metal metal amenities goes to show
[18:03] you know that where did that come from
[18:05] amen they cut out all the timber and i
[18:07] noticed and the great discoveries of
[18:08] education and great going on of science
[18:12] and progress
[18:13] of science he says it's a sign
[18:16] of the end time look what science has
[18:19] done in the last few years
[18:21] that's the things that it's done what is
[18:23] it nearing the end time
[18:25] he says it's a sign to all the believers
[18:28] and he says and ministers in the pulpit
[18:30] should be preaching it
[18:31] with all the force that they got showing
[18:34] the people
[18:34] that were passing milestones
[18:38] and all things point to the end amen
[18:42] all right
[18:46] now notice notice these smart educated
[18:50] canaanites out of the lineage of uh cain
[18:54] came these humble boys they married
[18:56] these humble peasant boys of seth
[18:58] and from there become great giants that
[19:00] were renowned
[19:01] we find out that they were great
[19:03] scientists
[19:05] great workers of wood great and smart
[19:08] and educated people they had a great
[19:12] economy huh that about what it is now
[19:16] the devil has a great economy let me
[19:18] tell you something
[19:19] the stock market that every nation
[19:22] on the heavens probably is tied to the
[19:25] stock market almost
[19:27] you know and they if if the stock market
[19:29] would crash it wouldn't just affect
[19:31] us it would affect everybody all over
[19:33] the world
[19:34] and they're trying to control how many
[19:36] of these are that's all in the hands of
[19:38] the devil the devil's controlling
[19:39] all of that amen yes he is
[19:44] and you know uh but anyway so i know it
[19:46] was educated now
[19:48] he said became scientists educated
[19:50] people a great economy
[19:52] and they lived in such a scientific age
[19:56] until they built pyramids that we can't
[19:59] even
[19:59] build today i mean they were smart
[20:04] folk all right
[20:06] he says and they leave great marks that
[20:09] we see
[20:10] in the rock and the sands of time he
[20:12] said that we could not produce or
[20:14] reproduce today because those people
[20:16] leaned
[20:16] upon their knowledge and become
[20:18] scientists and smart men
[20:21] and renowned men but the sons of god
[20:24] that stayed humble stayed away from such
[20:26] as that
[20:27] and relied upon god
[20:32] how many is with me tonight we're not
[20:34] relying on the science and education
[20:36] we're relying on god i'm
[20:38] glad to be led by
[20:42] god amen
[20:46] so he says there's only two classes and
[20:49] i just want to put something in here
[20:51] two classes of people and that's the
[20:53] children of lawlessness
[20:54] and the children of god amen and there's
[20:57] a spirit
[20:58] he says it's called the spirit of
[21:00] lawlessness but he says there's
[21:02] also another spirit let me just let me
[21:04] uh
[21:08] right here here's what i'm looking for
[21:11] but i haven't finished this all right
[21:15] knowledge now men
[21:21] okay so the people today say they're
[21:23] smart they got all this
[21:26] and we do all this so much smarter than
[21:28] we was
[21:29] and we're so much further away from god
[21:31] than we were
[21:32] is that the truth look at the world so
[21:34] much more science but
[21:36] look how far
[21:39] away people found from god see
[21:42] you draw yourself away like that now i
[21:45] notice brother bam says now we find out
[21:47] that she's naked in this age she's lewd
[21:49] she's nude
[21:50] the world seems to be in the most evil
[21:52] age
[21:53] ever ever never in any day do women act
[21:57] like they do
[21:58] except for before the andaluvian
[22:00] destruction
[22:02] amen i wrote down here in my notes you
[22:04] don't have to wonder
[22:06] what people acted like and what they
[22:08] look like and what they
[22:09] did before the destruction isn't that
[22:11] right
[22:13] amen it was the most immoral world and i
[22:16] mean
[22:16] i'll tell you what it's just terrible
[22:19] what the world's gotten to
[22:21] but you know it says if you want to know
[22:22] what it looks like in the days of no all
[22:24] you got to do is go to walmart
[22:26] all you got to do is go out a little bit
[22:27] and you'll see exactly what it was like
[22:28] in the days of noah
[22:30] we don't have to wonder what it was like
[22:32] in days of life
[22:33] right and the immorality homosexuality
[22:36] caused people we hear it and see it
[22:37] every day
[22:38] amen totally immoral amen
[22:42] my no morality left anymore
[22:46] now notice so he says just before
[22:48] destruction jesus referred to it he says
[22:50] we'll get to it after a while
[22:53] says has god lost control or is he just
[22:55] permitting another agency to control
[22:58] i wonder and the true answer to this
[23:00] question to my opinion
[23:02] is that there's two opposing spirits in
[23:04] the world today
[23:06] at work he said now there can't be no
[23:08] more than two just two heads
[23:10] and one of them is the holy spirit at
[23:12] work and the other one is the spirit of
[23:14] the devil
[23:16] amen oh my and in these last days in
[23:19] deception now we're going to base our
[23:21] thoughts right there he says
[23:23] the two spirits one of them is god's
[23:25] holy spirit
[23:26] and the other one is the devil's spirit
[23:28] working in deception
[23:31] i thought about that and i got to
[23:33] thinking about how that each and every
[23:35] one of us
[23:36] is like a car a car
[23:40] right and a car has to have somebody on
[23:43] the steering wheel
[23:44] right somebody that has to turn the
[23:47] ignition somebody has to give it gas
[23:49] somebody
[23:50] has to push the brakes and we are only a
[23:53] vessel how many believes we're only a
[23:55] vessel
[23:55] and we are either driven we're driven by
[23:58] something you've heard people make the
[23:59] statement well
[24:00] i it was something just drove me to do
[24:02] that yeah something's driving you
[24:05] i mean believe tonight even every one of
[24:07] us is driven
[24:09] we are being driven by something
[24:11] something drives you
[24:14] amen praise the lord
[24:18] hallelujah if i wasn't up here praising
[24:20] god and saying thank you lord jesus i'd
[24:22] probably be cursing and drinking a bear
[24:24] huh bye we're going to be driven by
[24:27] something you're going to have some kind
[24:28] of a spirit on you
[24:30] some kind of a spirit is going to drive
[24:32] you so we have to ask ourselves
[24:34] what is driving you is it the holy
[24:37] spirit
[24:39] or is it the antichrist spirit remember
[24:42] the antichrist spirit will make you
[24:43] think you're okay and when you're
[24:45] lukewarm and when you're not what you
[24:46] ought to be
[24:47] the holy spirit will convict you of what
[24:48] you are it'll cause you to want to get
[24:50] closer to god
[24:53] amen so we're driven by something one or
[24:56] the other
[24:57] amen as bad as it is brother adam says
[25:00] there's only two
[25:01] two powers only things two only two
[25:03] things driving us
[25:06] and he says listen there's one of the
[25:07] spirit of god one of the holy spirit the
[25:09] other one working in deception the
[25:11] people of the earth are now
[25:12] making their choice and the holy spirit
[25:16] is here calling
[25:16] out a bride for christ amen how many is
[25:20] god's doing that he's calling a bride
[25:23] in this evil age that we're living in
[25:25] the most evil of all
[25:27] evil ages since the time of noah
[25:31] right and since the time of light it's
[25:34] never been this
[25:35] evil that's why they said in the days of
[25:38] noah when we read that sunday
[25:39] the thoughts of people's minds are only
[25:43] wicked constantly wicked amen
[25:46] people were wicked brother says it's an
[25:48] evil age
[25:50] and the devil is the god of this
[25:53] evil age evil wicked
[25:57] satan's eden is where we're in but in
[26:00] the middle of all that
[26:02] all right listen the holy spirit is
[26:06] calling a bride out
[26:07] he's doing it by vindicating his word of
[26:09] promise
[26:10] to her for this age showing that
[26:13] it is christ
[26:17] all right now notice whatever part of
[26:19] the spirit the holy spirit the spirit of
[26:21] god
[26:22] as it's growed into the full stature of
[26:26] god
[26:29] hallelujah how many believes the holy
[26:31] spirit
[26:32] has grown the church now into the fools
[26:38] of christ luther he just walked by faith
[26:44] hey i protest the child mark and these
[26:46] feasts is on the 99
[26:48] thesis so i guess he put tact on the
[26:50] door and stuff protesting the catholic
[26:52] church and he protested
[26:54] he was beginning to walk by faith
[26:56] sanctification through wesley and
[26:58] pentecost was speaking in tongues and so
[27:00] forth
[27:01] but brother brown says the holy spirit
[27:03] has come now and he is up a man
[27:05] so much until people thought he was
[27:08] jesus christ
[27:13] huh yeah people thought brother branham
[27:15] maybe was god
[27:19] i mean he could tell you who you're from
[27:21] where it is then he pronounced healing
[27:22] upon you and everything else in that
[27:23] right
[27:24] and how many times brother bran would
[27:25] have to clarify now i can't heal you
[27:27] i'm just your brother he would always
[27:29] have to clarify clever people still
[27:31] didn't listen
[27:32] you need to get a q-tip right and just
[27:34] clean it and listen
[27:35] i said i wasn't jesus you make me
[27:37] antichrist i'm getting off the field if
[27:38] this
[27:40] that serpent that he saw you know
[27:41] wiggling his tail he tried to kill it
[27:43] but he didn't quite kill it
[27:44] amen that's why he didn't quite kill it
[27:46] because he's still in the land today
[27:48] people trying to make g by the random
[27:50] god
[27:51] but it's so close he's grown into the
[27:53] full stature of god
[27:55] amen because so because you he knew that
[27:57] you and i would need this kind of a
[27:59] ministry
[28:00] that we would need to see and know and
[28:02] be proven that it's real otherwise we'd
[28:04] probably be swamped up too we wonder
[28:06] what to believe
[28:08] we feel in confusion i'm thankful for
[28:11] the message of the hour
[28:13] i'm thankful for what i thank god i say
[28:14] thank you lord jesus for sending a
[28:16] prophet
[28:17] let me tell you if you want one of the
[28:18] greatest signs of all signs that we're
[28:20] at the end time
[28:21] behold i kind of he says uh the day
[28:24] cometh that shall burn as an oven
[28:26] right right but i'll send you elijah
[28:28] before the great and dreadful day of the
[28:30] lord
[28:30] before this happens i'll send you lights
[28:32] that was the greatest sign this world
[28:34] saw
[28:35] amen was that was that god was fixing to
[28:37] destroy and burn this world
[28:39] was by sending my life all right
[28:44] so now notice
[28:48] i was gonna let you out at eight tonight
[28:50] i'm gonna let him out of eight and just
[28:51] surprise him
[28:53] but can i go a little further all right
[28:56] so now the spirit of god as he grows
[28:58] into the full stature of god the age
[29:00] that we're now living in the holy spirit
[29:02] here
[29:03] vindicating the message of the hour
[29:06] the holy spirit is doing this so that
[29:09] the people
[29:12] believe god will be called out
[29:15] of this chaos when you walk into walmart
[29:19] you don't look like everybody else when
[29:21] you go anywhere you don't look like
[29:23] you don't dress like everybody else hey
[29:25] man you're like a star
[29:26] you're like a light in the night they're
[29:28] like wow there goes the sister with the
[29:30] dress and long hair
[29:32] i mean he was homie you going anywhere
[29:34] you see that anymore it's like wow
[29:36] there's still some left
[29:40] oh my praise the lord
[29:44] that's right the holy spirit is doing
[29:45] this the devil's unholy spirit is
[29:48] calling his church by error
[29:52] as usual by perversion of the word of
[29:55] god like
[29:56] he did at the beginning amen see it
[29:58] coming right back to that seed time
[30:01] again
[30:01] from here it is again
[30:05] amen so now notice notice how beautiful
[30:08] the scriptures tied themselves together
[30:10] in every age
[30:11] when the church would not have that word
[30:13] of god to rule over them they
[30:16] accept that they murder barabbas
[30:19] how many knows that how many that's
[30:21] exactly what
[30:22] cain did when he did not accept the
[30:24] revealed word of the hour
[30:26] he became a murderer
[30:29] huh and murdered his brother
[30:33] he was a murderer he picked up a rock
[30:35] probably and
[30:36] mashed his head in out in the field he
[30:38] was a murderer
[30:41] amen so now here again he says you know
[30:43] even
[30:44] um now i was going to read it i'll save
[30:47] time but over there in
[30:48] saint john i believe it is brother uh
[30:50] not brother but jesus christ was talking
[30:52] to the pharisees and there was disputing
[30:53] whether he was of god and
[30:55] all of these out of the other and
[30:56] calling him a devil and he was saying no
[30:58] you can't hear my word my word has no
[31:00] place in you i
[31:01] come from god and do his works if you
[31:03] would be of god you would hear me
[31:06] amen and then finally you talk so much
[31:08] until he said i
[31:09] and my father are one and they took up
[31:12] stones to stone him
[31:14] what is it amen you get an argument with
[31:17] the lineage of the devil
[31:18] and they'll get so mad until they will
[31:20] try to kill you
[31:24] amen that's where it leads to where
[31:25] they'll actually kill you
[31:27] i mean that's what the world that we're
[31:28] living in is people amen that'll take
[31:30] that
[31:30] same way with the pharisees amen with
[31:32] stephen amen they got so
[31:34] mad they got so angry until they
[31:37] actually touched on him didn't they
[31:40] amen you talk about the people that like
[31:42] to grab some rocks and
[31:43] kill people now jesus did condone so
[31:46] many bad people
[31:47] that were rebellious but he never
[31:48] condoned stoning good people
[31:52] but that's what cain does he is a amen
[31:55] somebody
[31:55] likes us kill people and now i notice
[31:59] so now notice so he says they chose they
[32:02] accepted a murderer
[32:03] for rabbits what did this do
[32:06] oh my it exalted satan
[32:10] the god of this evil age amen
[32:14] notice how he says how beautiful the
[32:15] scriptures tie themselves together in
[32:17] every age brother batman's talk bringing
[32:19] it down to our age
[32:20] also it exalted satan
[32:24] the god of his evil age to a place
[32:26] that's always that he's always
[32:28] wanted to be in listen satan has not
[32:31] spoke of the god of any other age but
[32:34] until in this age he is the god of this
[32:37] age
[32:37] worshiped by millions and billions of
[32:40] people
[32:41] and they don't know it
[32:44] that's pretty strong in it that's right
[32:48] now let's just look at that
[32:52] he knows that whenever jesus come along
[32:54] when cain come along they would he would
[32:56] not accept it
[32:56] when jesus come along and tried to tell
[32:58] them the truth they would not accept it
[33:00] they absolutely rebelled
[33:03] against the word of god in that hour
[33:06] they came against it they rejected it
[33:08] and they rebelled against it just like
[33:10] the churches did
[33:11] in our day i mean those day rebelled
[33:15] they accepted something that was going
[33:17] to kill them
[33:18] a barabbas a murderer
[33:22] they accept that the same lie
[33:25] that satan told eve
[33:28] a perverted word that right
[33:31] all right
[33:37] and what did it do it classified them
[33:41] as the spirit
[33:44] and the children of what
[33:48] disobedience it put them into the class
[33:52] of disobedience
[33:58] all right
[34:11] but said it wasn't until this hour this
[34:13] age
[34:14] that actually satan is actually in the
[34:17] place that he wanted to be
[34:20] not six thousand years ago but much fur
[34:24] further back than that when he was up in
[34:26] heaven
[34:27] i want to be like god i want to be like
[34:29] the most high
[34:30] all right and he rebelled against
[34:32] anything he didn't care anything what
[34:33] god said or had to say
[34:35] just like a rebellious child the most
[34:37] horrible nightmare is for they don't
[34:38] care what you say what you think
[34:40] they're gonna do what they're gonna do
[34:42] and that right
[34:43] that's what he was he had an ambition
[34:45] that he had
[34:46] and listen so he he
[34:50] he he's achieving what he wanted
[34:54] and i want to own a i want to give you
[34:56] another signpost another milestone i
[34:58] believe that's happening right here in
[35:00] front of us
[35:02] amen that's showing us where we're at
[35:06] but let me let me read this here let me
[35:08] read this before i do that
[35:11] listen so he says now she is the devil's
[35:14] bride wrapped in his religious
[35:16] sin-loving knowledge
[35:17] for this present evil age to deceive you
[35:20] the whole clique of denomination
[35:23] of seduce seducing spirits by scientific
[35:26] knowledge
[35:27] and a modern civilization claiming
[35:31] that she's building a great world for
[35:33] you to live in how many knows that
[35:34] this whole world and everything about it
[35:36] is geared to make it easier
[35:39] to sin in
[35:42] easier to sin in all right
[35:46] because that's what the devil is he
[35:48] that's what he is his sin
[35:52] she claims that her civilization she has
[35:55] built fine churches colleges schools
[35:57] hospitals libraries
[35:59] temporary health for man without god's
[36:02] word she's done it
[36:04] she's proved that she could do it and
[36:05] the people fell for it yes sir
[36:07] schools denominations culture better
[36:10] dress people better fed people but i'd
[36:12] rather be in the
[36:13] red line and be right with god than to
[36:15] have chicken three times a day and
[36:16] belong to a prostitute like that
[36:19] now he knows that when you go against
[36:20] the word of god you automatically come
[36:23] into the
[36:23] class of a prostitute
[36:27] that's why over in revelations i want to
[36:29] read it again
[36:30] over revelations that
[36:34] she was called
[36:39] it says all nations have drunk of the
[36:41] wine of the wrath of her
[36:43] fornication fornication okay
[36:48] and the kings of the earth have
[36:49] committed fornication with her
[36:51] and the merchants of the earth our wack
[36:53] structure delicacies
[36:55] so that we can say that whole
[36:58] church world pentecost baptist everybody
[37:00] that goes against the word of god
[37:02] they actually commit spiritual
[37:04] fornication against almighty god
[37:08] right so now notice
[37:12] she says i'd rather have that now you
[37:13] remember the hour is close at hand when
[37:15] the mark will come
[37:16] and you will be either in or you'll be
[37:19] out and it'll come like a thief in a
[37:20] night and it'll catch you right there
[37:22] and there you are you ain't gonna get
[37:24] out of it then you done took it
[37:26] so he says come out the angel that came
[37:29] down from heaven with a great shining
[37:31] face
[37:31] and cried with the people that shook the
[37:33] earth come out of babylon for she's
[37:35] fallen be that partakers of her plagues
[37:38] her sins my people get out of her get
[37:41] out
[37:42] didn't you just read that in the word
[37:43] while ago the angel's message see
[37:45] coming down notice the holy spirit he's
[37:48] called
[37:48] getting her to come out of there that
[37:50] you've been out partakers of her
[37:53] sins that you receive not of her plagues
[37:56] so that's what god is doing in a broad
[37:58] right form because
[37:59] how many knows that jesus said you know
[38:02] over revelations he says blessed are
[38:03] they that do my commandments that they
[38:05] might have a right to the tree of life
[38:09] if you love me keep my commandments how
[38:10] many believe that the children of
[38:11] obedience
[38:13] they want to obey every word that is in
[38:15] him
[38:16] every word that's in here at the
[38:18] children of god but the
[38:20] children of the devil they don't want to
[38:21] have any of it
[38:23] and now i'm going to tell you what i
[38:25] wanted to tell you in this
[38:26] i think what's going on in our political
[38:28] system it certainly has a spiritual
[38:30] significance
[38:32] because we
[38:35] realize there's people and there's
[38:36] congress people over there out there now
[38:39] that
[38:39] we thought were just plain dumb we just
[38:41] they would make statements that was
[38:42] completely
[38:44] completely unfathomable isn't that right
[38:47] and we're like wow
[38:48] but those same people are becoming more
[38:50] popular than anything
[38:51] all right there i just read today where
[38:53] where some of those congress people are
[38:55] that are have the craziest idea there's
[38:57] the most popular
[39:00] and look at what we've gotten to now now
[39:03] the churches
[39:04] brother branham oh my we could go on and
[39:05] on the god of this evil age brother
[39:07] brown says the churches man you can wear
[39:09] bikinis you can wear your hair
[39:10] you can do all of these things and you
[39:12] can still belong to him you can still
[39:14] belong to church
[39:15] now right denominational church doesn't
[39:17] support and
[39:18] listen even it's hard to believe that
[39:20] even
[39:21] churches that would call themselves
[39:23] pentecost we're a pentecostal church
[39:25] we believe in pentecost a real new
[39:27] experience and
[39:28] the holy holy absolutely antichrist
[39:33] absolutely have turned god away no more
[39:35] god in it than that brother i'm saying
[39:37] that everyone's dead they've turned god
[39:39] away
[39:40] so never never thinking that remember
[39:42] the devil and his children they are
[39:44] very very religious those folks out
[39:46] there the whole world practically is
[39:48] religious
[39:49] not everybody but it's most people are
[39:52] and brother goes into detail if you want
[39:54] to listen to
[39:56] that tape god of this evil age he talks
[39:58] about how that
[39:59] the devil let her do anything and that's
[40:01] what people want people want to be able
[40:02] to do
[40:03] anything and call themselves christians
[40:05] that is the devil's church that's the
[40:07] devil's people
[40:08] they don't really want to have any rules
[40:10] they don't want to follow any laws
[40:13] isn't that right and now our country and
[40:17] the state that we are
[40:19] oh my and people are falling for our
[40:22] sports people and the whole world's
[40:24] falling for it
[40:25] amen to even thinking about defunding
[40:28] the police
[40:29] isn't that right and you to think that
[40:32] is the dumbest thing that you could ever
[40:34] do
[40:34] you know right but so many people
[40:38] so many people are listen
[40:42] it's not about defunding the plea you
[40:44] know what it means if you defund the
[40:45] police you know how many what is a
[40:46] police officer
[40:47] a police officer is somebody that is a
[40:51] what do you call him now a law
[40:54] enforcement officer
[40:57] right police is law enforcement
[41:00] officers they want to get rid of the law
[41:03] enforcement officers why because they
[41:06] don't want no law
[41:09] they're disobedient they don't obey
[41:12] anything
[41:13] and that right children of disobedience
[41:17] are coming to their climax they're
[41:19] coming to where they want to live in the
[41:21] world where there ain't no laws
[41:23] that's where cain wanted to live god
[41:26] says do this
[41:27] now i'm going to do that huh
[41:30] jesus said to the fast do this you need
[41:32] to do that no we don't want to do none
[41:34] of that
[41:34] huh look at what the prophet god came
[41:36] and said you've been you this is what
[41:38] you need to do and this is the rules of
[41:40] god
[41:40] you know you can't add one word or take
[41:42] one word away
[41:43] and they're right we don't want to do
[41:45] that we're going to reject you know
[41:46] throw you all out we all want to do what
[41:48] we want to do that's what the world that
[41:49] we're living in
[41:50] and to think that that move would be
[41:52] that probably powerful
[41:54] and that popular let me tell you
[41:56] something
[41:57] anybody that supports that partakes of
[42:00] it and that
[42:02] anybody supports it partakes of it
[42:04] becomes part of it
[42:06] and why do you think you have the
[42:09] lawlessness
[42:10] isn't that right and they're letting
[42:13] them
[42:14] peter they're actually letting them uh
[42:16] one news anchor
[42:18] went to the went to do a you know a
[42:20] series and so forth and he went to a big
[42:22] old party these
[42:23] young people were having and they were
[42:25] just getting drunk and just smoke
[42:26] they were just having a party because
[42:28] they're we're in a little bit
[42:30] we're going to go do this a bunch of
[42:31] stuff we're going to lie
[42:33] we're going to do this that or the other
[42:35] i mean they pre-planned these things
[42:38] do you know what used to happen with
[42:40] something like that
[42:41] you'd have law and order we're calling
[42:44] for law and order in a world
[42:46] of lawlessness
[42:49] now notice what brother branham said and
[42:50] that's what i've come to this
[42:52] thought in the beginning was what is it
[42:55] the world's heading to
[42:56] a climax with the spirit
[43:00] of lawlessness so we can see how that we
[43:03] are climaxing
[43:06] the spirit of no law
[43:10] we come into our climax that spirit
[43:12] started with cain
[43:14] and it's right here in front of us
[43:17] and we can scratch our heads and say
[43:19] really
[43:20] don't you realize what kind of world
[43:22] that would be
[43:24] what kind of world will it be i don't
[43:26] know but
[43:27] i don't want to be here when it comes to
[43:29] fruition are you with me tonight
[43:31] lord help us i believe it is another
[43:34] milestone
[43:35] it is telling that hey it's the children
[43:38] of cain
[43:39] the children that were taught to disobey
[43:41] they're truly children of disobedience
[43:45] no respect they don't want the law
[43:47] chicago now
[43:48] then people in those uh those thoughts
[43:51] that
[43:51] they're very careful now because they
[43:53] said that we want you fair the cop comes
[43:55] around we want you to shoot him
[43:56] and record it they've got a word out
[43:59] just
[43:59] shoot him and record it spirit of
[44:02] lawlessness
[44:03] it's on us how many believes it and
[44:06] where did it come from first it started
[44:08] with the churches
[44:10] churches ain't going to follow god's
[44:11] word huh how many knows your mom and dad
[44:14] don't follow the word well the kids
[44:15] ain't going to worship more about
[44:17] where he's about your word won't hold
[44:19] much weight
[44:20] isn't that right and if uh our
[44:22] government and all these other people
[44:24] churches and so forth they don't do it
[44:27] then the children will do it
[44:28] and the devil bread it right into him
[44:30] and bring it right into it
[44:32] because the devil doesn't want no law he
[44:34] wants to do whatever he wants to do
[44:37] that's the devil that's his children
[44:40] this is his eden
[44:41] and we're coming to the climax with the
[44:44] spirit of lawlessness
[44:46] god bless you let's stand tonight
[44:52] because we all know that his law is not
[44:55] a law
[44:55] but even brother brown said it wasn't
[44:57] unless it's enforced
[44:59] amen doesn't mean anything if it isn't
[45:02] enforced
[45:04] how many is glad to be a part of the
[45:05] children of this and not disobedience
[45:07] but obedience
[45:08] we want no part of disobedience we want
[45:10] to say lord here we are
[45:12] help me to believe every word the
[45:14] prophet god said
[45:16] full obedience to every word of god

[45:20] to the token amen we want to obey
[45:24] everything that jesus said but this
[45:26] shall
[45:27] all men know that you are my disciples
[45:30] if you
[45:31] keep my commandments no he didn't say it
[45:33] just that way but over it says
[45:35] you know we know that we love him
[45:38] if we keep his commandments in first
[45:39] john with our heads bowed
[45:43] how many feels the holy spirit is here
[45:46] he's speaking to us showing us where the
[45:49] world is
