[1:06:36] a happy anniversary to you
[1:06:40] may you be all jesus
[1:06:50] anniversary to you and the best one
[1:06:55] you've ever had
[1:07:00] amen
[1:07:04] amen god bless you this morning thank
[1:07:06] you all that'll be all for the music
[1:07:09] amen this morning let's just
[1:07:12] amen change the order of service get
[1:07:15] into the
[1:07:16] word of god this morning would that be
[1:07:17] all right amen stand with me
[1:07:25] i'll tell you what yeah i hope that the
[1:07:27] lord just
[1:07:28] anointed the way that he did when he
[1:07:30] gave this to me amen i don't know just
[1:07:33] how it will be but i think it was
[1:07:38] friday night i think it was friday night
[1:07:40] maybe or thursday night about
[1:07:42] two o'clock i woke up and i had been
[1:07:45] praying of course for a message and
[1:07:46] as i usually do and so then he just
[1:07:50] began to lay pour something on my heart
[1:07:52] was up for about an hour probably just
[1:07:54] trying to you know i was laying on the
[1:07:56] bed there after i got up and laying
[1:07:58] there and meditating on the lord and
[1:08:00] uh he began to just kind of pour it out
[1:08:02] and i says well you know if you don't
[1:08:04] get up and write this down you won't
[1:08:06] remember it for sure you know so
[1:08:07] i got up and began to write things down
[1:08:10] and so
[1:08:10] you just i know that you're praying for
[1:08:12] me and help
[1:08:14] for the lord's help amen because this
[1:08:17] you know being in the place of a
[1:08:18] minister the more i
[1:08:20] the older i get i'll say this as the
[1:08:22] older i get i feel
[1:08:24] i feel the gift of god in my life i feel
[1:08:27] that
[1:08:28] pulling stronger amen it's getting
[1:08:30] stronger and pulling harder
[1:08:32] amen it really is because i believe that
[1:08:35] we're living in a late hour amen and and
[1:08:38] so
[1:08:39] i just pray that i can yield myself and
[1:08:42] meant to god in a greater way that he
[1:08:44] can use me in a greater way amen
[1:08:46] but this morning and i know that michael
[1:08:48] i think hawbaker had that he said
[1:08:51] told me one time that he kind of wanted
[1:08:53] to he wished he but i maybe sometime
[1:08:55] would give
[1:08:56] my life story amen and this won't be my
[1:08:59] life story but it is will be a testimony
[1:09:02] i mean about my life amen and so forth
[1:09:05] but
[1:09:06] um we'll just pray and then we'll read
[1:09:09] the word of god and see what the lord
[1:09:10] will have for us
[1:09:12] but as i begin to look at this and study
[1:09:15] this i realize that
[1:09:16] we could be here a long time amen
[1:09:19] because if i wanted to try to say all
[1:09:21] that i want to say
[1:09:21] and and the lord began to pour out to me
[1:09:23] we would be here a while but
[1:09:25] amen we'll just try not to go you know
[1:09:27] longer than the holy spirit will have us
[1:09:29] go
[1:09:30] but uh i believe that on this easter day
[1:09:34] i mean you know this is easter day which
[1:09:36] we say easter but that's the
[1:09:37] resurrection day amen
[1:09:39] this is the day that he rose from the
[1:09:41] dead i mean it was really a big day
[1:09:44] that right because if he didn't raise
[1:09:46] from the dead everything he said didn't
[1:09:48] mean a thing
[1:09:50] but because it arose from the dead
[1:09:53] everything that he said
[1:09:54] meant everything it meant
[1:09:58] everything and let me tell you something
[1:10:00] it's true
[1:10:02] every word of it is true it's the only
[1:10:05] truth that we have
[1:10:06] because as you know the world is taking
[1:10:09] truth
[1:10:10] and making a lie and they're making a
[1:10:12] lie taking the lie
[1:10:14] and making it truth they're switching
[1:10:16] things around but they can't take this
[1:10:18] and make it a lie
[1:10:19] they'll never change this amen oh my
[1:10:24] so let's just bow our heads father we
[1:10:26] come before you this morning
[1:10:27] once again thankful to be able to
[1:10:29] assemble ourselves together lord and
[1:10:31] i do feel this morning that this will be
[1:10:33] a solemn assembly
[1:10:35] lord jesus a sobering solemn time father
[1:10:38] for us and
[1:10:39] and lord jesus we just ask god that is i
[1:10:42] feel that you've moved upon my heart in
[1:10:44] this way
[1:10:45] we ask god that you would just take the
[1:10:47] meditation of our heart
[1:10:48] father and the thoughts of our heart
[1:10:50] lord and father we desire god that
[1:10:52] you'll have your perfect way in
[1:10:54] everything that is said and done lord
[1:10:57] most of all we ask god that you would be
[1:10:59] the speaker lord jesus and
[1:11:01] father the gift that you've placed in my
[1:11:03] heart lord jesus just to be able to get
[1:11:04] myself
[1:11:05] out of the way and let you do the
[1:11:07] speaking father and then lord not just
[1:11:09] speaking but also to
[1:11:10] have your presence to come down lord
[1:11:12] jesus and to anoint
[1:11:14] both the speaker and the ears of the
[1:11:16] years lord for we know that
[1:11:18] outside of your presence lord jesus the
[1:11:20] word of god will seem like the newspaper
[1:11:23] that we might
[1:11:24] pay 25 cents for in the morning but lord
[1:11:27] when your spirit comes down it makes it
[1:11:29] alive to us lord jesus and it causes it
[1:11:31] to live
[1:11:32] and that's what we truly desire is that
[1:11:34] that word will live lord in our hearts
[1:11:36] and in our lives and be real to us
[1:11:38] and that your resurrection will be real
[1:11:40] to us father and that
[1:11:42] that same spirit that raised christ from
[1:11:44] the dead that it would also quicken
[1:11:46] our mortals body amen cause us to be
[1:11:49] alive father
[1:11:50] lord as i attempt lord jesus just to
[1:11:53] give a witness and to be a testimony for
[1:11:55] you
[1:11:55] this morning we ask god that you to be
[1:11:57] in everything that is said and done lord
[1:11:59] and we know that father
[1:12:00] every person that's in here lord we
[1:12:03] truly believe that it's been ordained of
[1:12:04] you
[1:12:05] this setting is unique father every
[1:12:07] setting is unique lord and
[1:12:09] we just ask god for you to have your way
[1:12:11] now in the name of jesus christ we ask
[1:12:13] it
[1:12:13] amen and amen amen turn your bibles if
[1:12:16] you will to the book of acts and we'll
[1:12:18] just go to the very scripture that i
[1:12:19] felt laid on my heart
[1:12:21] amen when i began to study this amen
[1:12:24] when it began to come to me amen i
[1:12:26] certainly have enjoyed the things that
[1:12:28] the lord has given us
[1:12:29] you know here lately amen
[1:12:32] i believe it was wednesday night we
[1:12:34] spoke of the wages of sin is death
[1:12:37] isn't that right but the gift of god is
[1:12:39] eternal life
[1:12:40] amen and and i think probably everybody
[1:12:42] here was there for that but
[1:12:44] the lord just really kind of anointed
[1:12:45] that thought and amen and give us a real
[1:12:48] description of what debt
[1:12:51] how that sin will take us further than
[1:12:54] what we want to go it'll take
[1:12:55] keep us longer than what we want to say
[1:12:58] and it will certainly cost us a whole
[1:12:59] lot more
[1:13:00] than what we want to pay amen and so
[1:13:04] you know and that goes for everybody i
[1:13:06] mean you know how many knows that people
[1:13:08] might be able to
[1:13:09] sin and sin and sin and and disbelieve
[1:13:12] the word of god you know but
[1:13:13] eventually at the day of judgment
[1:13:15] they'll pay and it'll cost them a whole
[1:13:17] lot more than they would have liked
[1:13:20] in uh acts the first chapter
[1:13:23] and we'll just go and i thought you know
[1:13:26] and i do have a couple of scriptures
[1:13:27] here that i'd like to perhaps
[1:13:29] read that has to do with the
[1:13:30] resurrection and has to do with easter
[1:13:33] but as i read this scripture i thought
[1:13:35] well you know this isn't this is really
[1:13:37] a
[1:13:37] easter message also so easter scripture
[1:13:40] amen now in acts 1 the former
[1:13:44] treaties have i made o theophilus of all
[1:13:48] that jesus began
[1:13:49] both to do and to teach unto the until
[1:13:52] the day in which he was taken up
[1:13:54] after that he uh through the holy ghost
[1:13:57] had given commandments unto the apostles
[1:14:00] whom he had chosen to whom he also
[1:14:03] showed himself alive
[1:14:05] after his passion by many infallible
[1:14:08] proofs amen now keep in mind that jesus
[1:14:11] has done
[1:14:12] this very same thing in our generation
[1:14:15] amen that he has shown himself alive
[1:14:19] with many infallible proofs amen
[1:14:24] being seen of them 40 days and speaking
[1:14:28] of the things that pertain to the
[1:14:30] kingdom of god amen
[1:14:33] and being assembled together with them
[1:14:35] commanded them that they should not
[1:14:37] depart from jerusalem
[1:14:39] but wait for the promise of the father
[1:14:41] which saith he
[1:14:42] ye have heard of me for john truly
[1:14:45] baptized with water but you shall be
[1:14:47] baptized with the holy ghost
[1:14:49] not many days hence when they were
[1:14:51] therefore come together they ask of him
[1:14:53] saying will thou at this time restore
[1:14:56] again the kingdom of israel and he said
[1:14:58] unto them it is not for you to know the
[1:15:00] times and the seasons
[1:15:02] which the father hath put his own in his
[1:15:04] own power
[1:15:05] but ye shall receive power after that
[1:15:08] the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:15:11] and you shall be witnessed this unto me
[1:15:15] both in jerusalem and in all judea and
[1:15:18] in samaria
[1:15:19] and unto the other most parts of the
[1:15:21] earth
[1:15:22] and when he had spoken these things they
[1:15:24] have they while they beheld
[1:15:26] he was taken up and a cloud received
[1:15:29] them
[1:15:29] out of their sight and while they looked
[1:15:33] steadfastly towards heaven
[1:15:34] as he went up behold two men stood by
[1:15:37] them
[1:15:38] in white apparel which also
[1:15:41] said ye men of galilee why stand ye
[1:15:44] gazing up into heaven as i said before
[1:15:47] i had been one gazing is that right but
[1:15:50] has seen that i'd have been looking
[1:15:52] wouldn't you have
[1:15:53] he says why are you looking so engaging
[1:15:55] this same
[1:15:56] jesus which is taken up from you into
[1:15:59] heaven
[1:16:00] shall so come in like manner
[1:16:03] as you have seen him go into
[1:16:06] heaven may god add his blessings to the
[1:16:08] reading of the word you can be seated
[1:16:10] this morning
[1:16:13] what a powerful scripture
[1:16:16] amen and you know
[1:16:20] ever since jesus left
[1:16:23] even the disciples thought that he would
[1:16:26] come back any time
[1:16:28] even they thought that it would be we
[1:16:30] call this their second his second coming
[1:16:32] is that right where he comes back
[1:16:36] amen and for 2 000 years
[1:16:39] every generation of christians their
[1:16:42] anticipation
[1:16:43] their expectation their vision
[1:16:46] their goal their ambition has been
[1:16:50] to see him come back amen
[1:16:54] coming into clouds of glory as many
[1:16:56] wrong songs
[1:16:57] amen have been wrote about amen when he
[1:16:59] comes in the clouds of glory and so
[1:17:01] forth
[1:17:02] amen and we're expecting him to return
[1:17:04] but what i want to take
[1:17:05] not so much in that aspect this morning
[1:17:07] amen but i want to start with the eighth
[1:17:09] verse where he talks about ye shall
[1:17:12] receive power
[1:17:13] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:17:15] amen and you shall be witnesses
[1:17:17] unto me both in jerusalem and in judea
[1:17:20] and unto the other most parts of the
[1:17:23] earth
[1:17:24] praise be to god god now we know that
[1:17:27] he told the disciples he told them that
[1:17:30] they were supposed to
[1:17:31] go into the city of jerusalem until you
[1:17:34] be
[1:17:34] endued with power from on high
[1:17:37] amen now let's look at first of all we
[1:17:40] realize is that i want to talk on i want
[1:17:41] to call this
[1:17:42] i am a witness is that okay
[1:17:46] i am a
[1:17:50] witness
[1:17:53] amen and that's what we'll talk about
[1:17:56] with the help of the lord
[1:17:57] you know and a witness in the court of
[1:17:59] law we know that a witness is somebody
[1:18:01] that they will
[1:18:02] use as evidence
[1:18:06] isn't that right a witness can be used
[1:18:09] as
[1:18:09] evidence against somebody in other words
[1:18:12] if somebody testifies hey
[1:18:14] he did it to me it happened to me i was
[1:18:17] there
[1:18:18] i experienced it
[1:18:22] so in order to be a proper witness you
[1:18:25] have had
[1:18:26] to have experienced it
[1:18:29] praise be to god amen
[1:18:33] brother tommy wasn't you there whenever
[1:18:35] that one man was raised from the dead
[1:18:37] and by the brandon meeting saw it
[1:18:41] we have this man sitting right here
[1:18:43] that's seen a man raised from
[1:18:45] raised from the dead in brother
[1:18:46] branham's meetings see he's a witness
[1:18:49] he saw this man here he could tell he
[1:18:52] already told i love to have lunch with
[1:18:53] him because
[1:18:54] he can tell you story after story after
[1:18:56] story of things that he saw
[1:18:58] places that he spend and things that
[1:18:59] he's experienced brother branham's
[1:19:01] children they can tell you story after
[1:19:03] story after story
[1:19:05] of what god has done dear witnesses
[1:19:08] see it'd be different if everybody was
[1:19:10] gone but so hundreds of thousands of
[1:19:13] witnesses
[1:19:14] and you and i become a witness i believe
[1:19:16] every christian
[1:19:18] becomes a witness
[1:19:22] amen and you know it isn't always about
[1:19:25] just seeing things hello i mean that was
[1:19:29] because even
[1:19:29] thomas he wouldn't believe unless he saw
[1:19:32] it
[1:19:33] but even jesus said you know what is
[1:19:35] better for you not to have
[1:19:36] seen and still believe
[1:19:40] amen but this here when it comes to the
[1:19:43] power of the holy ghost
[1:19:44] when it comes to talking about the lord
[1:19:46] when he talks about the
[1:19:48] salvation is what he really wants us to
[1:19:51] testify about
[1:19:52] it's the plan of salvation and what god
[1:19:54] has done
[1:19:56] amen now we know that he told them over
[1:20:00] i believe it in mark he says you know
[1:20:01] mark 16 he says
[1:20:03] he says you know afterwards he appeared
[1:20:07] unto the eleven that
[1:20:08] sat at meat and operated them for their
[1:20:10] unbelief and hardness of heart because
[1:20:12] they would not believe on them
[1:20:13] that had seen him after he was risen and
[1:20:16] he said unto them
[1:20:17] go ye into all the world and preach the
[1:20:20] gospel to every creature
[1:20:24] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:20:26] be saved he that believeth not
[1:20:28] shall be damned
[1:20:31] amen so salvation is based on faith in
[1:20:34] god
[1:20:35] people that believe the gospel amen
[1:20:38] shall be saved
[1:20:39] they didn't believe not shall be damned
[1:20:42] this brings me to my story
[1:20:45] amen that's what a lot of you know
[1:20:49] igual de edchikiboda
[1:20:54] i was born dutch or amish born amongst
[1:20:57] the amish
[1:20:59] and you know i have a lot of respect for
[1:21:01] amish homies folks are
[1:21:02] some of the best in the world very kind
[1:21:06] you know and you know but you know in
[1:21:09] their group
[1:21:09] it's the same as another group there's
[1:21:11] good and there's bad
[1:21:14] you know i was born raised that way and
[1:21:16] you know i want to say it's good
[1:21:17] it's a good way to have been raised
[1:21:21] is that right becky it's a good way to
[1:21:25] have been raised man we didn't have the
[1:21:26] soda to pop we didn't have the nintendo
[1:21:28] game we didn't have the music
[1:21:30] we wasn't messed up at eight years old
[1:21:32] like most of them are today
[1:21:36] huh it's true even the prophet of god he
[1:21:40] says you know they're very holy they
[1:21:41] live
[1:21:42] very holy in other words they have very
[1:21:44] strict rules and
[1:21:45] and no unholiness you know but we find
[1:21:48] out that holiness isn't just about the
[1:21:50] outward
[1:21:51] even though it does have to do with what
[1:21:52] you do and don't do amen
[1:21:54] of whether you stay clean or not amen
[1:21:58] but anyway so you know i was that way
[1:22:00] until i was about 14. i'm
[1:22:02] not going to go so much on that but i
[1:22:03] just maybe say it's a good way to have
[1:22:05] been or to be from amen i don't care if
[1:22:09] it's amish
[1:22:10] i don't care if it's mennonite i don't
[1:22:11] care if it's baptist i don't care what
[1:22:13] it is we all look back and we realize
[1:22:15] that
[1:22:16] in those churches they have certain
[1:22:17] things they believe and if you're going
[1:22:19] to be in those churches you have to
[1:22:21] believe what they believe
[1:22:23] and if you go beyond that guess what
[1:22:25] you're in trouble
[1:22:27] that's where the problem is not which
[1:22:29] establishment and so forth them
[1:22:30] but most with all churches they put a
[1:22:33] period behind what they believe
[1:22:35] they create offense and god doesn't stay
[1:22:38] in any of that
[1:22:40] amen but anyway we'll get into that a
[1:22:43] little bit later
[1:22:44] perhaps but let's go on amen and while i
[1:22:46] was about 14 years old you know
[1:22:48] most of my my uh you know like i said i
[1:22:51] can't go into the full depth of it but i
[1:22:53] know that my dad he had gotten a
[1:22:54] revelation of the word
[1:22:56] and he believed the word and he be
[1:22:58] forget the holy ghost or whatever you
[1:22:59] know and he began to talk to them about
[1:23:01] the word and so forth
[1:23:02] and of course immediately if you uh you
[1:23:05] know come against him in any way
[1:23:06] you're going to be sean put in the band
[1:23:08] and all these other things and
[1:23:10] and so forth and he was looked down upon
[1:23:12] him as a result as his kids looked was
[1:23:14] looked down upon you know and
[1:23:16] kind of persecuted and and and you know
[1:23:19] it just didn't like really fit in and of
[1:23:21] course i think
[1:23:22] money he was the first one to you know
[1:23:24] run away from home and so forth him and
[1:23:26] moe's and
[1:23:27] and you know they went up in the top of
[1:23:29] the barn i guess it was and they cut
[1:23:31] each other's hair
[1:23:32] and you can imagine what that looked
[1:23:34] like that was a real mess
[1:23:37] they decided they didn't want it to be
[1:23:39] cut hair like that they wanted an
[1:23:40] english haircut and
[1:23:42] they ran away from home and of course
[1:23:43] the police caught him and brought him
[1:23:45] back home and
[1:23:46] and you know it was a sight to behold
[1:23:48] i'll never forget when i was in that a
[1:23:50] schoolhouse
[1:23:51] i was in the schoolhouse and they sent
[1:23:54] them to school
[1:23:55] and they come down over that over to
[1:23:57] gravel the road
[1:23:58] down through there and of course
[1:24:00] everybody in the school then was all
[1:24:02] looking out the window here they come
[1:24:04] here comes them little runaways you know
[1:24:06] and when they come in they'll thought
[1:24:08] your
[1:24:08] hair was still cutting it wasn't right
[1:24:10] there was no fixing that you know
[1:24:13] but anyway and so they begin to do that
[1:24:15] and it wasn't too long after they jumped
[1:24:17] the fence so to speak that they kind of
[1:24:19] like
[1:24:19] fence jumping and they didn't last long
[1:24:21] they ran away again and so forth
[1:24:23] but anyway they ended up ended up all of
[1:24:25] the kids ended up going away from home
[1:24:27] so forth and
[1:24:28] i was one of the last ones if i'm i
[1:24:30] think maybe one more
[1:24:31] after me but i was one of the very last
[1:24:33] ones to go amen and my sister placed me
[1:24:35] in the mennonite home amen because she
[1:24:37] was men and i
[1:24:38] and i just lived with a mennonite
[1:24:39] preacher for a little while
[1:24:41] amen and and so i think it was a year
[1:24:44] perhaps
[1:24:44] uh i was 14 when i left amen 14 years
[1:24:47] old that's pretty young isn't it
[1:24:48] i'll never forget the first two weeks i
[1:24:50] was going i'll tell you what i got
[1:24:52] homesick and i cried for mom
[1:24:54] you know i really cried for mom and dad
[1:24:56] and at home you know how it is but after
[1:24:58] that two weeks it kind of broke off
[1:25:00] and i lived with this guy and his
[1:25:01] preacher of course he was they were
[1:25:03] pretty much
[1:25:04] nice to me overall you know but i was a
[1:25:06] really really backwards guy because if
[1:25:08] you raise the homies most of the time
[1:25:10] that's what you're going to be you're
[1:25:11] going to be pretty backwards you know
[1:25:13] you don't
[1:25:13] talk too much you don't have a lot of
[1:25:15] conversation you're just
[1:25:17] quiet bashful
[1:25:22] you know and that's just how i was and i
[1:25:24] didn't talk too much and and of course
[1:25:26] he didn't like that too well he wanted
[1:25:27] me to open up and perhaps get close to
[1:25:29] me as anyone would
[1:25:30] but i just didn't really know how to go
[1:25:32] about all of that but anyway
[1:25:34] and we did all right i helped him on the
[1:25:35] farm and so forth and and uh
[1:25:39] and but he you know he did have a temper
[1:25:40] and he he boy i'll tell you what he got
[1:25:42] so mad at once i mean he tried to give
[1:25:44] me a whooping
[1:25:45] i was 14 i was pretty stout he didn't
[1:25:47] quite get it accomplished but
[1:25:49] anyway
[1:25:52] so anyway after after a while
[1:25:56] uh you know i come to the place he'd get
[1:25:58] upset and get mad you know finally
[1:26:00] brother moani you know he was he was
[1:26:02] already english and laying block and
[1:26:04] doing
[1:26:04] masonry work and so one morning i
[1:26:06] decided i don't think
[1:26:08] this is for me so i packed my bags and
[1:26:10] while he was down there milking the cows
[1:26:12] i went in the house dropped my bags out
[1:26:14] of
[1:26:15] whatever belongings i had dropped the
[1:26:16] doctor when the graft and then went up
[1:26:18] through the woods
[1:26:19] i went i don't think i could even i
[1:26:21] don't think i even knew how to find
[1:26:22] delton i don't know how y'all know that
[1:26:25] and anyway i was
[1:26:26] you know but i was up through the woods
[1:26:27] up through the field and i found my
[1:26:29] brother
[1:26:29] at 16 years old he got me a job hello
[1:26:33] mixing mud wheeling wheelbarrows
[1:26:36] carrying brick
[1:26:37] laboring hard keeping them guys supplied
[1:26:40] and i worked hard and many a days i
[1:26:42] would have to mix black mud with the
[1:26:43] mortar
[1:26:44] i'd come with that stuff i was a black
[1:26:46] man for the red end of that day
[1:26:49] you know but worked hard and i learned
[1:26:50] to work hard
[1:26:52] and i think by 16 or 16 and a half and
[1:26:55] then i met some other buddies and i just
[1:26:57] went out into the world
[1:26:59] amen and uh you know live with my
[1:27:02] brother and so forth and
[1:27:04] of course you know uh you you just once
[1:27:07] you get out of that and you're free
[1:27:08] you feel like you're free right and so
[1:27:11] the scripture came to me i want to read
[1:27:13] uh i'll read you a scripture of of the
[1:27:16] first status of how i felt like i was
[1:27:19] and it certainly was that way and i
[1:27:20] think i read it
[1:27:22] uh last wednesday and so
[1:27:25] you know it was it was here and i like i
[1:27:28] said i began to live with my
[1:27:30] brother for a little while and while i
[1:27:31] was with my brother before i've got some
[1:27:33] buddies together we actually got
[1:27:34] together and rented an apartment
[1:27:36] or a trailer for ourselves you know it
[1:27:38] wasn't long before
[1:27:40] you know you get into sin you get into
[1:27:42] the things of the world isn't that right
[1:27:44] whether it's drinking and so forth and
[1:27:46] smoking and we won't get into that
[1:27:47] because none of that is
[1:27:48] anything that is to be proud of in that
[1:27:51] right
[1:27:52] but uh you know because i'll tell you
[1:27:55] what if you have a christian parents
[1:27:57] that raise you in the nurturing
[1:27:58] admonition of god and
[1:28:00] you can just fall right into it and you
[1:28:01] can get into the baptism of the holy
[1:28:03] ghost and
[1:28:04] give your life to god that you just save
[1:28:06] yourselves a whole lot of trouble
[1:28:08] because i still have to hard times once
[1:28:11] in a while
[1:28:12] some song will pop into my head that i
[1:28:14] gotta resist get out of here
[1:28:15] because the flesh might like it if flesh
[1:28:17] likes that rock and roll but
[1:28:18] the spirit don't hey you gotta block
[1:28:20] that out but yet that's so engraved
[1:28:22] because of those years
[1:28:23] that i spend listening to those things
[1:28:26] amen and it affects you and you
[1:28:28] if you don't have that trouble you're a
[1:28:29] blessed person but you know
[1:28:31] paul said you know that when we were in
[1:28:33] sin and we were
[1:28:35] he says i speak after the man and this
[1:28:37] is in romans 6 and verse 19.
[1:28:39] i speak after the manner of men because
[1:28:41] of the infirmity of your flesh
[1:28:43] and as you have yielded your members
[1:28:45] servants to uncleanness
[1:28:47] and to iniquity and to iniquity and
[1:28:50] that's the way i was living
[1:28:51] now i was going to live in the flesh i
[1:28:52] was going to sin i was going to do
[1:28:54] whatever i wanted to do and i did
[1:28:56] everything i wanted to do
[1:28:58] huh and let me tell you something i'm
[1:29:00] still doing everything i want to do
[1:29:04] i'm a christian and i do everything i
[1:29:06] want to do
[1:29:08] because those things are different now
[1:29:09] my appetite is different
[1:29:11] i want to do different things and folks
[1:29:14] if you
[1:29:14] if you're doing something because you
[1:29:16] feel like you have to
[1:29:18] you haven't got it like you should have
[1:29:19] it yet
[1:29:21] no it'll give you a desire blessed are
[1:29:23] those that hunger and thirst after
[1:29:24] righteousness
[1:29:25] but anyway unto iniquity even so
[1:29:29] now paul says yield your members as
[1:29:32] servants unto righteousness
[1:29:33] unto holiness for when ye were servants
[1:29:36] of sin
[1:29:37] you were free from righteousness
[1:29:41] now let me know that sin has a certain
[1:29:43] amount of pleasure there is a certain
[1:29:44] amount of pleasure even moses
[1:29:46] he says you know he pursued the
[1:29:48] pleasures of egypt isn't that right
[1:29:50] the pleasures that he could have had sin
[1:29:51] is beautiful sin may be very pleasurable
[1:29:54] but let me tell you sin will leave you
[1:29:57] empty
[1:29:58] inside it will leave you
[1:30:01] dead the only real thrill that it has is
[1:30:04] what it can give your body because it'll
[1:30:06] leave you
[1:30:06] with no spirit in here amen
[1:30:10] but i was that way i was to wear you
[1:30:12] know and like i said it started with the
[1:30:14] johnny cash i fell into the ring of fire
[1:30:17] and that right
[1:30:18] i went down and the flames went higher
[1:30:20] well thank god he saved me from the
[1:30:22] flames
[1:30:23] praise be to god but he went from one
[1:30:24] thing to another all the way to ac dc
[1:30:27] and that inhale and
[1:30:28] as hard as you could get you know and
[1:30:30] you know in my time you know if you
[1:30:32] perhaps shot up with a needle or
[1:30:33] something and maybe
[1:30:34] maybe with some kind of i don't know
[1:30:36] what it was but i only shot with a
[1:30:37] needle one time and it
[1:30:39] certainly certainly made you feel good
[1:30:40] in that out but you know we have here
[1:30:42] people to this morning that went into
[1:30:44] this crack cocaine and
[1:30:45] what they have nowadays was is way
[1:30:49] stronger than what i experienced my time
[1:30:51] amen and it has a lot stronger hold on
[1:30:54] you
[1:30:54] it is a lot worse for you if you survive
[1:30:57] it you're a blessed person isn't that
[1:30:59] right
[1:31:00] and i thank god they didn't have that
[1:31:01] stuff back then in my day amen because
[1:31:03] what i had was bad enough
[1:31:04] but anyway notice here it says you know
[1:31:06] we were free from righteousness paul
[1:31:08] says
[1:31:09] when you were servants of sin you were
[1:31:11] free from righteousness
[1:31:13] and what fruit had ye then indo things
[1:31:16] where you
[1:31:16] are now ashamed that's right
[1:31:20] those things are shame how many believes
[1:31:22] that amen like the bible says you know
[1:31:24] we did those things people do things
[1:31:26] things in darkness that you don't even
[1:31:28] want to talk about
[1:31:30] that it is a shame to even speak of some
[1:31:32] of those things that we did
[1:31:35] amen but you know you think about that
[1:31:38] he says for the end of those things
[1:31:40] is death amen but now
[1:31:44] being free but now being made free from
[1:31:48] sin we become servants of god ye have
[1:31:50] your fruit unto righteousness
[1:31:52] and the end everlasting
[1:31:55] life the one thing i liked about my
[1:31:59] youth the one thing i liked about the
[1:32:00] freedom that i thought i had
[1:32:02] is man i could just i thought i was
[1:32:05] living
[1:32:06] huh like brother bam talked about when
[1:32:10] he went in a hotel room and seen all of
[1:32:12] those women going are half naked and
[1:32:13] everything else you know and
[1:32:15] and they thought they were having a good
[1:32:16] time they thought this is life it's not
[1:32:18] really life
[1:32:19] he might think that it's life but it's
[1:32:21] not life
[1:32:23] it's death amen
[1:32:26] i mean it's death because we have a
[1:32:29] tendency you know if you've been bound
[1:32:31] up real tight all your life you have
[1:32:32] a tendency to go plumb way out there
[1:32:36] let me tell you something where there's
[1:32:37] a lot of churches that ain't christian
[1:32:39] that are not really right
[1:32:40] the world isn't right either it's going
[1:32:43] to the same place a lot of churches a
[1:32:45] lot of church folks are going yellow
[1:32:47] but i'm thankful that god has provided
[1:32:48] us a way
[1:32:50] he has got us made his way so i was the
[1:32:52] servant of sin
[1:32:53] amen lived and i thought you know but
[1:32:55] you know whether you was alcohol whether
[1:32:57] it was drugs whether it was
[1:32:58] girls and whatever you wanted to do and
[1:33:01] all of those things at the end of the
[1:33:02] day
[1:33:03] the next morning it would leave you
[1:33:06] with a headache and totally empty inside
[1:33:11] the only thing you had to look forward
[1:33:12] to was another budweiser at the end of
[1:33:14] the day
[1:33:15] to try to make you feel a little better
[1:33:17] and it never did make you feel
[1:33:19] feel good now i remember working when i
[1:33:21] was still up in ohio
[1:33:23] before i moved down to still work in
[1:33:25] ohio there amen and i
[1:33:26] i was working with a christian young man
[1:33:29] and he tried to lead me to the lord
[1:33:32] he tried to testify to me
[1:33:36] you know later in my sermon i will talk
[1:33:37] to you about how that jesus says no man
[1:33:39] can come to me
[1:33:41] except my father draw him
[1:33:45] i've got good news and i got bad news
[1:33:47] for you this morning
[1:33:49] bad news is you're not coming unless god
[1:33:52] draws you you're not coming to jesus
[1:33:55] unless god draws you
[1:33:57] you won't have no desire to there's a
[1:33:59] lot of people have no desire i don't
[1:34:00] want nothing to do with religion i don't
[1:34:02] want nothing to do with god
[1:34:04] if you're in that place you're in a sad
[1:34:05] place
[1:34:07] because you're blessed amen if god
[1:34:10] knocks on your door
[1:34:12] and i thank god that later on amen later
[1:34:15] on
[1:34:16] that changed for me that changed for me
[1:34:20] even though that boy
[1:34:20] tried to leave me the lord and i didn't
[1:34:22] want nothing to do if anything i was
[1:34:24] going to make fun of it or whatever
[1:34:25] i didn't want nothing to do with it
[1:34:29] didn't really want anything to do with
[1:34:30] the lord or anything like that
[1:34:33] amen and i ended up my brother moved to
[1:34:36] florida because there was work down
[1:34:38] there there was masonry work a lot of
[1:34:40] masonry work back in the 80s
[1:34:42] building condominiums and so forth so we
[1:34:45] went down there and worked down there
[1:34:46] for a while once again living in sin for
[1:34:48] about
[1:34:48] the thank you i'm so thankful though god
[1:34:51] by the grace of god it was from 17
[1:34:53] 18 19 20 no more than about four years
[1:34:56] before god got a hold of me
[1:34:59] amen before something began to move in
[1:35:02] my heart
[1:35:04] amen but you know you thought
[1:35:07] you know i thought boy this you know i
[1:35:09] just want to live i love
[1:35:10] life the bible says if he that will love
[1:35:13] life
[1:35:13] and if you want to see good days let his
[1:35:16] tongue refrain from evil
[1:35:18] and a true that which is evil amen
[1:35:22] how many knows who doesn't but want to
[1:35:24] live
[1:35:25] everybody like being alive i like living
[1:35:29] i like the life that god has given you
[1:35:31] how many knows each and everyone in here
[1:35:33] this morning
[1:35:34] if you are alive this morning you have
[1:35:36] been chosen by god
[1:35:38] because in the conception between your
[1:35:40] mom and dad
[1:35:41] there could have been a million others
[1:35:43] that he could have chose
[1:35:46] for the conceived could have been red
[1:35:47] head could have been black it could have
[1:35:48] been
[1:35:49] could have been any of that but we know
[1:35:51] that through that
[1:35:52] there is a predestinated one that ends
[1:35:55] up being conceived
[1:35:56] amen and we are chosen alive god chooses
[1:36:00] us to life
[1:36:02] you know right chooses us alive amen and
[1:36:04] i begin to
[1:36:05] it means something begin to pull me and
[1:36:08] you know you might think well i
[1:36:10] began to seek god i found out that it
[1:36:12] wasn't me seeking god
[1:36:14] if it was me i didn't want nothing to do
[1:36:15] with it but god began to draw me he
[1:36:17] began to knock on my heart's door
[1:36:21] but you know i had done been amish i had
[1:36:23] done been mennonite and i had done been
[1:36:24] all of these others and i looked at all
[1:36:26] the churches around look
[1:36:27] everywhere and i began to say well what
[1:36:29] is right what can you believe what is
[1:36:31] the truth
[1:36:33] huh and of course does that begin to
[1:36:37] multiply in my
[1:36:38] heart and so forth i made my repentance
[1:36:40] on my own in the little old trailer that
[1:36:42] i was living in and say god i want to
[1:36:44] find you god i want to serve you
[1:36:46] but i don't know what to do i don't know
[1:36:49] where to go
[1:36:52] and i didn't even really want to read my
[1:36:53] bible at first because of all the
[1:36:55] confusion that is
[1:36:56] around it how many know i'll tell you if
[1:36:59] you're not going to be a christian
[1:37:00] because of all the hypocrites that are
[1:37:02] around
[1:37:02] because of all the false people that are
[1:37:04] around and you're just never going to be
[1:37:05] a christian
[1:37:07] because there's all kinds of stuff all
[1:37:09] around
[1:37:11] but there's a real true kernel there
[1:37:14] there's the real truth there
[1:37:18] amen praise be to god
[1:37:23] and something began to draw me some
[1:37:25] begin to call me
[1:37:28] not begin to wonder what was the truth
[1:37:30] and i made my commitment my repentance
[1:37:32] and i began to
[1:37:33] then after a bit something said you know
[1:37:36] pick that bible up
[1:37:39] and believe it from one end
[1:37:42] to the other believe all of it
[1:37:46] you have to believe if you're son of god
[1:37:48] you have to believe that this is the
[1:37:49] truth
[1:37:50] that this is god's word because if you
[1:37:53] don't believe that
[1:37:54] you have no real ground to stand on
[1:37:58] amen now of course i take the scriptures
[1:38:01] and
[1:38:02] all of a sudden i found myself in
[1:38:04] spiritual debates with people
[1:38:06] talking to this preacher or that group
[1:38:08] or whatever in minecraft sarasota
[1:38:11] you know searching for something

[1:40:09] but anyway one of them said something
[1:40:11] about you got any papers to roll some of
[1:40:13] that tobacco
[1:40:14] and i'll tell you right now i figured
[1:40:16] out right quick i don't care which kind
[1:40:18] of deback it was i didn't want no part
[1:40:20] of it because i done that and didn't

[1:40:26] no more wacky tobacco you know
[1:40:28] no more cigarettes and things like i
[1:40:30] want to get away from i want to be holy
[1:40:32] i want my temple to be holy before god
[1:40:33] am i right
[1:40:34] but i searched and i looked then one day
[1:40:37] one day
[1:40:38] there in minecraft
[1:40:41] amen i met john steeman
[1:40:45] pastor of that church down there and uh
[1:40:48] also sam golden they were out there
[1:40:50] witnessing the ivan brother irvin
[1:40:52] they was there ivan was there and
[1:40:54] different ones were there and they were
[1:40:56] over there and
[1:40:56] i think it was david miller and and i i
[1:40:58] was over here by the
[1:41:00] uh the fruit market and over here was
[1:41:03] the saw shop the sauce up where where
[1:41:06] they sharpened songs and things and they
[1:41:07] were over there
[1:41:08] and then brothers were clean cut you
[1:41:10] know and they were just as testifying as
[1:41:12] this boy and i looked over there and
[1:41:14] something said in my heart
[1:41:15] now there's some real brothers they're
[1:41:17] some real brothers
[1:41:19] so i went over there and i tested them
[1:41:21] with the same scripture that i had
[1:41:23] tested everybody else with
[1:41:24] where the bible says he that is born of
[1:41:26] god does not commit sin
[1:41:28] for his seed remaineth in him he that
[1:41:31] sinneth is of the devil and so forth
[1:41:34] you know and that unbelief we know that
[1:41:36] that sin is the unbelief to disbelieve
[1:41:38] the word of god is sin
[1:41:40] you'll go to hell you will burn in hell
[1:41:42] for one thing alone
[1:41:43] and that is not to believe what god said
[1:41:45] that's good enough
[1:41:46] that's all you have to do is not believe
[1:41:48] what god said he that believeth not go
[1:41:50] preach the gospel he that believeth and
[1:41:51] he's baptized shall be saved he'd
[1:41:53] believe in that
[1:41:53] shall be down pretty simple all these
[1:41:57] other things that people do
[1:41:58] are attributes because they don't
[1:42:00] believe
[1:42:01] amen so that i i brought that out
[1:42:04] wednesday talking about the whole world
[1:42:06] it'll be condemned all god has to ask on
[1:42:08] the day of judgment did you believe what
[1:42:10] i said
[1:42:11] did you believe what i said
[1:42:16] all right there's europe what did the
[1:42:17] bible say if he believeth not shall be
[1:42:19] damned
[1:42:20] off into the lake of fire you go that's
[1:42:23] all he has to do
[1:42:24] because he listen what he did on calvary
[1:42:27] what he did on this weekend for us
[1:42:29] hello it was the secret to the whole
[1:42:32] mystery of the gospel
[1:42:35] oh my the whole gospel i'd love to get
[1:42:38] into it for a minute maybe i will but
[1:42:40] what is to preach the gospel to preach
[1:42:42] the gospel is to tell the story
[1:42:44] the mystery that has been hid from ages
[1:42:47] and from generations paul said in
[1:42:48] colossians 3 i believe it is
[1:42:50] has now been made known unto the church
[1:42:53] what is the mystery of god
[1:42:55] what is the real mystery of it all and
[1:42:57] how how
[1:42:58] all of creation everything it's all been
[1:43:00] made known
[1:43:02] how did god would allow us to get into a
[1:43:04] sinful state
[1:43:05] how that eve would fall and how that we
[1:43:08] would get
[1:43:09] to where we are actually born in sin
[1:43:12] shaped in iniquity come into the world
[1:43:14] speaking like we were born in sin
[1:43:16] we didn't have a chance god knew
[1:43:19] all of that before there was even one
[1:43:21] star thus created
[1:43:23] he knew exactly how it would all be he
[1:43:25] knew who would
[1:43:26] have that seed on the inside of them
[1:43:28] that god would call
[1:43:30] didn't i i told you i had good news and
[1:43:32] bad news i haven't given you the good
[1:43:34] news yet
[1:43:35] the bad news is that you can't come
[1:43:38] unless
[1:43:39] the father draws you no man can't come
[1:43:42] unto me except my father draw him
[1:43:44] let me just read that scripture would
[1:43:45] that be okay i've got it here
[1:43:48] gonna take our time this morning is that
[1:43:50] okay
[1:43:52] i believe it's in saint john
[1:43:56] all right saint john they were asking
[1:43:58] him
[1:43:59] they said in verse 42 of verse chapter 6
[1:44:03] is not this jesus the son of joseph
[1:44:05] whose father and mother we know
[1:44:07] how is it then that he said i came down
[1:44:10] from heaven
[1:44:11] in other words he had to say i had come
[1:44:13] from god and i go back to god and so
[1:44:14] forth
[1:44:15] you know oh my
[1:44:19] jesus therefore answered and said unto
[1:44:21] them why murmur not amongst yourselves
[1:44:24] now he's going to get real strong he's
[1:44:27] going to get real strong
[1:44:28] they can't believe that he came from
[1:44:30] heaven because we know his mom and dad
[1:44:32] and do you realize most of the time the
[1:44:34] bible says that a prophet
[1:44:36] or a person of god is usually not
[1:44:38] accepted they are usually accepted
[1:44:41] except for by those of their kin folks
[1:44:44] and in their own country
[1:44:45] usually that's the people that reject
[1:44:48] what god sends them
[1:44:50] and so then he says to them no man can
[1:44:53] come unto me
[1:44:54] except the father which has sent me draw
[1:44:58] him
[1:44:59] i can preach all morning we can read the
[1:45:01] word of god and everything
[1:45:02] else but you know unless god draws you
[1:45:07] that's right it's going to be nothing to
[1:45:09] you
[1:45:11] i was at that place i was at that place
[1:45:13] in my youth
[1:45:14] whenever trying my tried to witness to
[1:45:15] me i was like you know i just didn't
[1:45:17] have no drawing
[1:45:18] i had no interest huh
[1:45:22] and it's not a good place folks i thank
[1:45:25] god that he didn't take me
[1:45:26] in all of those for those bikes that i
[1:45:29] was riding around and driving around
[1:45:31] illegally and
[1:45:32] dodging cars and flying through
[1:45:34] graveyards and trying to
[1:45:36] miss the tombstones instead of bashing
[1:45:38] my head into one of them or
[1:45:40] you know coming up the stop sign and
[1:45:42] it's wet roads and i can't
[1:45:44] stop and i gotta go take the ditch and
[1:45:46] almost take my head off on the
[1:45:48] guide wire on the telephone poles and
[1:45:50] everything else brother tommy i'm glad
[1:45:51] to be alive aren't you
[1:45:53] thank god that he spared us during those
[1:45:55] times
[1:45:57] amen no desire
[1:46:01] but you know i'm thankful that god began
[1:46:03] to fordraw me amen but listen
[1:46:06] so he said no man can come except my
[1:46:07] father and i will
[1:46:09] raise him up at the last day are you
[1:46:12] ready for the good news
[1:46:14] the good news is that he says in the
[1:46:18] same chapter a little bit earlier
[1:46:22] he says in verse 35 and jesus said unto
[1:46:24] them i am the bread of life he that
[1:46:26] cometh to me
[1:46:28] shall never hunger and he that believeth
[1:46:31] on me
[1:46:32] shall never thirst that life that i was
[1:46:36] thirsting for
[1:46:38] it just wasn't in budweiser it just
[1:46:40] wasn't in drugs it wasn't in pleasure it
[1:46:42] wasn't
[1:46:43] you know how many knows it would never
[1:46:45] satisfied those things never satisfy
[1:46:48] well i'll give me a husband and i'll be
[1:46:49] happy no you won't
[1:46:51] i'll give me a wife and i no you won't
[1:46:53] there's only one thing that'll really
[1:46:55] ever satisfy
[1:46:56] a son and daughter of god and that is
[1:46:58] jesus christ
[1:47:00] the baptism of the holy ghost that's the
[1:47:02] only thing that'll ever satisfy
[1:47:04] that's not really where i was going but
[1:47:06] let me go on but i say unto you that you
[1:47:08] also have seen and believe
[1:47:10] not all the father hath giveth me
[1:47:14] shall come to me
[1:47:17] hallelujah how many believes all that
[1:47:20] the father hath given him
[1:47:22] that he has predestinated and knew
[1:47:23] before the foundation of the world
[1:47:25] that they would comment that they would
[1:47:26] have a desire in their heart
[1:47:29] all that the father will come
[1:47:32] will come to me folks i wish i had wings
[1:47:36] to fly to think
[1:47:37] that i was one of those that he knew
[1:47:40] would come
[1:47:43] you will come if you're god's child
[1:47:46] you will come listen let me let me
[1:47:50] read this wrong for just a second second
[1:47:54] and all that he has given me i should
[1:47:57] lose some of them
[1:48:01] folks i'm one that believes that when
[1:48:03] god saves you
[1:48:05] at 20 years old at 59 you're still going
[1:48:08] to be saved
[1:48:10] he holds you it's for time and eternity
[1:48:14] there's a lot of people that just get a
[1:48:16] taste of it just a little bit
[1:48:18] just enough just to make them more
[1:48:20] hungry or whatever it is
[1:48:22] but if you ever get really genuinely
[1:48:24] born again it is not something you did
[1:48:25] in the first place
[1:48:26] it's something that god did in you
[1:48:32] thing i want to do is live
[1:48:35] i wanted to live i still want to live
[1:48:41] and not just live as the world might
[1:48:44] think but i want to live
[1:48:46] eternally eternally
[1:48:50] in one we can't imagine but in a hundred
[1:48:53] million years from now
[1:48:55] thomas byler believes that he'll still
[1:48:57] be alive
[1:49:01] living in the presence of almighty god
[1:49:07] and listen folks just as sure as we're
[1:49:10] sitting here
[1:49:13] i'm gonna enjoy some beautiful sunshine
[1:49:15] isn't it beautiful out
[1:49:17] really nice we get to enjoy it but i'm
[1:49:18] here to tell you
[1:49:20] that one of these days the place is
[1:49:22] gonna be burning
[1:49:25] it's gonna be on fire not going to be
[1:49:28] such a good day
[1:49:32] amen behold the day cometh
[1:49:36] both cruel amen their elements shall
[1:49:40] the heavens shall be on fire and the
[1:49:41] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[1:49:44] all that do wickedly shall be
[1:49:47] ashes under the soles of your feet
[1:49:50] when i was still out in the world
[1:49:56] living in sin i look at the sun
[1:50:00] and look at the clouds that look around
[1:50:02] and i'd realize you know
[1:50:04] that sun just don't make a perfect
[1:50:05] circle by itself every time
[1:50:08] the seasons all of these things they
[1:50:10] just don't do that by themselves
[1:50:12] there's got to be a god somewhere god
[1:50:15] has to be
[1:50:16] somewhere he's got to be real
[1:50:19] and i realize you know i may be young
[1:50:21] now but i have no promise of tomorrow
[1:50:23] you don't know when you're going to get
[1:50:24] killed or die
[1:50:26] and sure maybe you'll get old maybe
[1:50:28] you'll live to get old but today
[1:50:30] folks just like from there to now it's
[1:50:32] just to snap a finger time goes really
[1:50:34] fast
[1:50:37] and the holy spirit is beginning to make
[1:50:39] me realize hey you know we're so
[1:50:41] temporal here
[1:50:42] this is just a temporary place that we
[1:50:44] are
[1:50:46] and it's like we are on uh in the water
[1:50:48] we're like it's like we're in the water
[1:50:50] heading carts and niagara falls
[1:50:53] all right and maybe maybe we can just
[1:50:56] hear it just a little bit a little bit
[1:50:58] of a
[1:51:02] [Music]
[1:51:04] way up ahead you hear a roar like
[1:51:07] huh
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:14] you're not going to live forever folks
[1:51:16] you're going to come to the judgment
[1:51:17] you're going to come to the place where
[1:51:19] you'll give an account for everything
[1:51:20] you've ever done
[1:51:22] there's something in your soul says
[1:51:24] there's got to be a way
[1:51:26] there's got to be a way that i don't
[1:51:27] have to be condemned there's hellfire
[1:51:29] waiting that we've been preached to for
[1:51:31] a long time
[1:51:32] how about how that you know every man
[1:51:34] who's going to stand before god and give
[1:51:36] an account for what he's done
[1:51:37] is that right and they got to begin to
[1:51:41] pull on me and i begin to say god help
[1:51:43] me
[1:51:44] show me what's true and let me go on
[1:51:45] with my testimony and then we'll get
[1:51:47] into some of these things
[1:51:48] but you know i met those brothers and i
[1:51:49] went over there and i tested them with
[1:51:51] the
[1:51:51] with the word of god and and they begin
[1:51:53] to say that's exactly right
[1:51:55] brother tom that's exactly right tom
[1:51:59] i believe that if the bible says it's
[1:52:01] the truth how many believers i don't
[1:52:02] matter if you understand
[1:52:04] the bible's the truth anyway
[1:52:08] and they begin to tell me you know
[1:52:09] that's right you know and he just began
[1:52:11] to talk about
[1:52:11] the antichrist system and the mark of
[1:52:14] the beast is coming in and
[1:52:15] how the america is going to get in the
[1:52:17] financial bind and how that
[1:52:19] catholics are going to pay off the debt
[1:52:20] you know we i don't know maybe it's
[1:52:23] already done i don't know
[1:52:24] but we got to borrow all these trillions
[1:52:26] of dollars from somebody
[1:52:29] isn't that right just as sure as we're
[1:52:32] sitting here folks
[1:52:33] it's happening and it's going to happen
[1:52:36] we're here this morning
[1:52:37] that's why i say a solemn assembly
[1:52:39] because we search and we look at our
[1:52:41] souls and whether you're
[1:52:42] going to live or whether you want to
[1:52:44] become extinct
[1:52:46] because that's exactly what's going to
[1:52:47] happen
[1:52:49] and you can't come you can't have
[1:52:51] eternal life outside of jesus christ
[1:52:54] outside of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:52:56] and the new birth and the new birth is
[1:52:58] much more simple than what people figure
[1:53:00] but here i go let me pick that up a
[1:53:02] minute again so i talk to the brothers i
[1:53:04] begin to they begin to challenge me they
[1:53:06] begin to talk about all these things you
[1:53:07] know
[1:53:07] and then they tell me you know the bible
[1:53:09] says in malachi 4
[1:53:10] you know that before the great and
[1:53:12] dreadful day of the lord that god's
[1:53:14] going to send us a prophet
[1:53:16] that he's send a prophet and he'll turn
[1:53:17] our hearts back to the fathers again
[1:53:20] amen and i says well i don't know about
[1:53:23] that
[1:53:24] people get awful scary and he came and
[1:53:28] jesus christ they began to tell me how
[1:53:29] that jesus christ
[1:53:30] in his ministry would come and he would
[1:53:32] do this very same messiah
[1:53:34] sign as what he did when he was here on
[1:53:37] the earth
[1:53:38] he would discern the thoughts and tense
[1:53:39] of the people's heart
[1:53:41] and that woman when he did that to her
[1:53:43] heart he says you've had five husbands
[1:53:45] and the one you're living with now at
[1:53:46] yours
[1:53:47] she ran into the city and said isn't
[1:53:49] this the messiah
[1:53:51] come see a man who has told me
[1:53:52] everything i've ever done
[1:53:54] isn't this the messiah
[1:53:59] and it says that the people believed on
[1:54:01] the lord because of her testimony
[1:54:05] do you realize that the human beings we
[1:54:07] as human beings
[1:54:08] we tend to be hard-headed
[1:54:11] we tend not to believe it's hard
[1:54:14] for god to get us to believe even his
[1:54:18] disciples
[1:54:19] let me i'll pick up my story with the
[1:54:20] help of the lord in a minute but let's
[1:54:22] talk about just how hard it seems to be
[1:54:25] for people to believe
[1:54:26] god because for one thing we know that
[1:54:29] he does it always in such simplicity
[1:54:31] that if you ever find jesus remember
[1:54:33] you're gonna find him in some humble
[1:54:36] little person you're going to find him
[1:54:39] in whatever is humble
[1:54:40] and most of the time it's going to be
[1:54:42] called the elzebab
[1:54:44] but we all in every generation comes to
[1:54:46] the place where you got to decide
[1:54:48] whether he's beelzebub or like pilate
[1:54:50] says what do you want me to do with this
[1:54:53] man
[1:54:53] called christ everybody has to decide
[1:54:56] what you're going to do with this jesus
[1:54:57] christ
[1:54:58] amen let's look at how humanity and
[1:55:02] how that we can be so hard-headed it's
[1:55:05] in mark
[1:55:07] this has to do with the resurrection and
[1:55:09] when jesus was early in the first day of
[1:55:11] risen early in the first day of the week
[1:55:14] he appeared first unto mary magdalene
[1:55:16] out of whom he had cast seven devils
[1:55:19] so mary was the first one to see jesus
[1:55:22] after he was resurrected
[1:55:24] and when she came and told them that he
[1:55:26] had been
[1:55:27] that had been with him as they mourned
[1:55:31] and wept
[1:55:32] and they when they had heard that he was
[1:55:33] alive and had been seen of her believe
[1:55:36] not huh
[1:55:39] how would you like to have a friend come
[1:55:41] say i saw him he's alive
[1:55:44] i don't believe you thomas was that way
[1:55:48] that's why my name has such a reproach
[1:55:50] on it because outing thomas he called
[1:55:52] him
[1:55:53] i just wouldn't believe well i wasn't
[1:55:55] the only one doubter
[1:55:57] well me or thomas this thomas wasn't the
[1:56:00] only doubter
[1:56:02] amen
[1:56:05] and afterwards he appeared in another
[1:56:08] form
[1:56:09] unto two of them and the bible talks
[1:56:10] about those two disciples coming from
[1:56:12] the road of emmaus remember and he
[1:56:14] talked to him and he did something that
[1:56:15] he had done before
[1:56:17] and they knew that it was him because of
[1:56:19] him doing something that he had done
[1:56:20] before
[1:56:21] see in this generation brother branham
[1:56:23] amen he preached he would
[1:56:25] preach the messages you know just like
[1:56:27] that and
[1:56:28] on that how that he had done something
[1:56:29] he had done before and they believed him
[1:56:31] but now jesus comes in our generation
[1:56:33] does exactly what he did when he was
[1:56:35] alive here on earth
[1:56:36] to prove that he is alive how many knows
[1:56:39] that's what the message is all about
[1:56:41] it's about showing to the world that
[1:56:43] he's alive when he was in front of
[1:56:45] india hindu and the 500 000 people he
[1:56:50] challenged
[1:56:50] all them priests he says you know if
[1:56:53] your god
[1:56:54] can open this blind man's eyes up i'll
[1:56:56] come and believe believe you
[1:56:58] whoever can do it i'll believe your
[1:56:59] religion huh
[1:57:01] i'm following religion but he says i
[1:57:03] can't do it either but
[1:57:04] jesus christ who i represent who rose 2
[1:57:08] 000 years ago
[1:57:09] he's here if he don't
[1:57:12] raise if he don't open this blind man's
[1:57:14] eyes you run me out of town
[1:57:16] and call me i put a sign on my back
[1:57:19] false prophet
[1:57:21] but if he'll open his eyes will you
[1:57:22] receive him
[1:57:24] amen they all said yes amen and i'll
[1:57:28] tell you what
[1:57:29] god opened that blind man's eyes
[1:57:32] to prove that he was risen
[1:57:36] take a moment see we're living the hour
[1:57:39] folks when
[1:57:40] the whole world is in darkness the bible
[1:57:43] says there'll be a day that's neither
[1:57:44] dark nor light i believe it's an amos
[1:57:46] but in the evening time it shall be
[1:57:48] light in that in the evening
[1:57:51] time god will come and he will show
[1:57:52] himself a life like he was two thousand
[1:57:55] he had done it in 2000 years
[1:57:57] but here jesus comes again amen in the
[1:57:59] prophet of malachi 4
[1:58:00] and he began discerning the thoughts in
[1:58:02] the states of the heart
[1:58:04] and people it's so hard for them to
[1:58:07] believe it
[1:58:08] that they do what dude let me tell you
[1:58:10] what they do
[1:58:15] and afterwards she appeared into the
[1:58:16] form of two another form and to the two
[1:58:19] of them as they walk and went to the
[1:58:20] country
[1:58:21] and they went and told it to the residue
[1:58:24] and they didn't believe it
[1:58:25] you tell but jesus is risen you tell him
[1:58:28] that he's not in the churches anymore
[1:58:31] that he has come out amen they they
[1:58:33] absolutely had him
[1:58:35] they absolutely crucified him afresh
[1:58:39] and put him in the opener shape
[1:58:42] but about where do you find that jesus
[1:58:45] isn't even in the churches anymore
[1:58:48] well we all know that most of the
[1:58:50] churches that we go to you can't be a
[1:58:52] real christian they won't accept they'll
[1:58:53] put you out
[1:58:54] if you're a real christian you must
[1:58:57] speak in tongues or prophesy in some
[1:58:59] skirts churches
[1:59:00] if you want to clap your hands and shout
[1:59:02] a little or say amen
[1:59:05] come on and even the pentecostals
[1:59:08] remember even the pentecostals in 1963
[1:59:11] got to the place even though they had
[1:59:13] sponsored and believed
[1:59:14] and come to the meetings where jesus
[1:59:16] christ was coming and discerning the
[1:59:17] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:59:19] it got to the place because that the
[1:59:20] prophet said denominationalism
[1:59:22] and churchianity like that is the mark
[1:59:25] of the beast it'll come to where if you
[1:59:26] belong to one of them
[1:59:27] you have taken the mark of the beast it
[1:59:30] might have been okay
[1:59:31] in day just passed to kind of not for
[1:59:34] sure know but now we know for sure
[1:59:36] jesus has come and he has vindicated and
[1:59:38] proved himself
[1:59:39] now our sins open i don't know not
[1:59:41] without abuse anymore
[1:59:43] and to disbelieve after god shows
[1:59:45] himself like that
[1:59:46] is absolute sin it's unbelief
[1:59:49] okay now notice told to the rest
[1:59:53] and they didn't believe him either
[1:59:58] i'm dumping around too much i said show
[2:00:00] me where he's outside of the churches
[2:00:02] see those stars look at those stars look
[2:00:05] at the church ages
[2:00:06] okay in revelations 1 and verse chapter
[2:00:12] 1
[2:00:12] verse 20 20 it says the mystery of the
[2:00:15] seven stars which thou saws in my right
[2:00:18] hand
[2:00:18] and the seven golden candlesticks the
[2:00:20] seven stars are the angels of the seven
[2:00:23] churches
[2:00:24] and the seven candlesticks which thou
[2:00:25] saw us are the seven churches
[2:00:27] and he goes to talking about all these
[2:00:29] different churches and so forth
[2:00:31] and that we know that by the revelation
[2:00:33] the prophet that that was the last two
[2:00:34] thousand years
[2:00:36] we have lived out each one of those ages
[2:00:39] in other words when brother bennett
[2:00:40] preached his message of the seven church
[2:00:42] ages
[2:00:43] when he was there after he preached him
[2:00:45] had brought out
[2:00:46] the attended the angel of the lord i
[2:00:48] don't know if tommy was there or not but
[2:00:49] he could tell you about it
[2:00:50] people that was actually there an angel
[2:00:52] of lord came like
[2:00:54] into the back of the church i believe it
[2:00:55] was and you know it
[2:00:58] he said the back of the church i guess
[2:00:59] it would have been back there i don't
[2:01:00] know but listen
[2:01:01] it says and the angel came and drawed it
[2:01:03] out supernaturally exactly like that it
[2:01:05] was
[2:01:06] that's how much god proved that that was
[2:01:08] the truth amen
[2:01:10] but we find in the last church age okay
[2:01:13] the layout is your church age
[2:01:14] they were rich they were increased with
[2:01:16] goods they didn't think they had needed
[2:01:18] nothing
[2:01:18] people's going to go do what they want
[2:01:20] to do how they want to do it
[2:01:22] they think they got everything but the
[2:01:24] bible says they're wretched miserable
[2:01:25] poor blind and naked
[2:01:27] and they don't know it
[2:01:31] homosexuality is endorsed anymore in our
[2:01:34] churches it's the cage of every unclean
[2:01:36] spirit and a foul bird oh my and
[2:01:39] you how does this tie in with your
[2:01:40] testimony brother see i didn't know what
[2:01:42] was right
[2:01:43] i come to find out later that these
[2:01:45] churches and so forth
[2:01:46] are actually full of unclean and hateful
[2:01:49] birds the way i
[2:01:50] the only way you'll really find christ
[2:01:52] is to come out of it
[2:01:54] get out of there get out of there why
[2:01:57] i'll show you what
[2:01:58] in verse 20 it says behold this is the
[2:02:01] only place that he ever says
[2:02:03] to any of the churches i stand at
[2:02:06] your door and knock
[2:02:10] jesus was outside the churches
[2:02:13] knocking trying to get in and i believe
[2:02:16] this was fulfilled in around 1963
[2:02:19] when they wouldn't even allow their
[2:02:21] members to come
[2:02:22] to brother bannon's meetings again where
[2:02:24] jesus would come down after he would
[2:02:25] preach
[2:02:26] he would discern the thoughts and tense
[2:02:27] of people would get healed blind would
[2:02:29] be
[2:02:30] open and receive their site miracle
[2:02:32] after miracle and they would absolutely
[2:02:34] excommunicate somebody that would
[2:02:36] participate in it they
[2:02:38] put him outside now he's outside
[2:02:42] trying to get back in but he doesn't get
[2:02:45] into churches again and they don't let
[2:02:46] him they have never let him in
[2:02:48] now he's knocking on people's hearts
[2:02:50] door
[2:02:52] how many know that jesus loves you this
[2:02:55] morning let me tell you something you
[2:02:56] may not have a friend in the world
[2:02:58] because
[2:02:58] i when after i got saved after i come
[2:03:01] and i talk to those brothers
[2:03:03] and i actually come to begin to uh you
[2:03:05] know you know
[2:03:06] they showed me acts 2 38 the real way to
[2:03:08] get born again
[2:03:10] you know because it says in acts 2 that
[2:03:12] they were pricked in their hearts the
[2:03:14] men of israel said to
[2:03:15] peter them he did that they were pricked
[2:03:17] in their hearts and said what must i do
[2:03:18] to be saved and peter said
[2:03:20] repent everyone of you and be baptized
[2:03:22] in the name of the lord jesus christ for
[2:03:23] the remission of your sins and you shall
[2:03:25] receive the holy ghost
[2:03:27] the promise is to you to your children
[2:03:29] to them that are far off
[2:03:30] even as many as our lord our god shall
[2:03:33] call see
[2:03:37] that's the true plan of salvation some
[2:03:39] churches will have you
[2:03:40] you know and i was when i was men and i
[2:03:42] thought i became a church a member of
[2:03:43] the mennonite church and i had to go to
[2:03:45] uh
[2:03:46] because instruction class what they
[2:03:48] called for six months
[2:03:51] i didn't read that in the bible the way
[2:03:53] the true way of salvation is for you to
[2:03:56] accept the word of god
[2:03:58] in your seat right where you sit like
[2:04:01] cornelius in his house
[2:04:03] when peter coming he preached to them it
[2:04:05] says while he
[2:04:06] yet spake these words the holy ghost
[2:04:09] fell upon
[2:04:10] them amen and then peter says i command
[2:04:12] you get baptized
[2:04:14] if you get the baptism the holy ghost on
[2:04:16] your heart i command you this morning
[2:04:18] you better get baptized in the name of
[2:04:20] jesus christ for there's no other name
[2:04:22] given under everywhere by you must be
[2:04:24] saved
[2:04:25] and how many more how many people came
[2:04:27] to christ that day over 3 000 people
[2:04:30] come to christ
[2:04:31] on the day of pentecost why because they
[2:04:33] accepted it
[2:04:34] instantaneously oh my
[2:04:37] how many believes we don't have church
[2:04:39] memberships the only church membership
[2:04:41] our prophet brought us was according to
[2:04:43] first corinthians
[2:04:44] by one spirit are we all baptized into
[2:04:46] one body
[2:04:47] and members in particular praise god how
[2:04:50] many knows that's the only way you
[2:04:51] really come into the body of christ
[2:04:53] is through the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:04:57] amen but notice here
[2:05:00] he was standing outside of the door
[2:05:02] knocking trying to get him come in
[2:05:04] a minute and i believe that jesus loves
[2:05:06] he the only reason we're still here
[2:05:09] is because still i believe that jesus is
[2:05:11] calling
[2:05:12] just like he called me
[2:05:16] like he called you and i you know
[2:05:19] i'm gonna make a couple more points this
[2:05:20] morning
[2:05:22] after i did get baptized that says look
[2:05:25] if that's the way you're supposed to be
[2:05:26] baptized if you're supposed to re accept
[2:05:28] the lord that way and i didn't
[2:05:29] understand about a prophet and all of
[2:05:31] that i
[2:05:31] kind of had to begin to listen to the
[2:05:33] tapes and so forth
[2:05:35] because if you'll remember the angel of
[2:05:36] the lord told the prophet you
[2:05:38] you store up those tapes you record
[2:05:40] those tapes but
[2:05:41] because in a later hour it's what's
[2:05:43] going to sustain you'll have food
[2:05:45] later on so that we could actually feed
[2:05:48] on it otherwise every one of us would
[2:05:49] look like them people out there
[2:05:51] we'd all be having perhaps earrings and
[2:05:53] all kinds of tattoos looked like the
[2:05:55] world we'd be lost if it wouldn't have
[2:05:56] been for what god did
[2:05:57] and the food that he stored up
[2:06:02] aren't you thankful for the food he
[2:06:03] stored up
[2:06:05] amen
[2:06:10] so i began to get baptized and i went
[2:06:13] down to philippi creek
[2:06:15] got baptized amen come up out of the
[2:06:18] creek
[2:06:20] and i was there on the banks and
[2:06:22] something happened very special i don't
[2:06:24] know how much of the holy spirit i had
[2:06:25] before that
[2:06:26] but i'll tell you what philippi creek is
[2:06:29] a slow running creek
[2:06:32] it goes real slow real slow
[2:06:37] and me and brother john he went and
[2:06:38] baptized me in the name of jesus christ
[2:06:41] i come back up and prayed i come up out
[2:06:44] of there and i sit there and i thought i
[2:06:45] was just going to float away
[2:06:48] all my sins all my cares
[2:06:52] all my wicked doings all washed away
[2:06:56] folks if you don't know the washing
[2:06:58] power of the lord jesus christ
[2:06:59] you don't know nothing he can wash every
[2:07:02] stain
[2:07:03] away put it in the sea of his
[2:07:05] forgetfulness
[2:07:09] aren't you glad for that
[2:07:17] and afterwards after i got the baptism
[2:07:21] in the holy ghost i was saved
[2:07:22] i love the lord i was such a peaceful
[2:07:24] feeling
[2:07:26] my buddies i think it was brother ivan
[2:07:28] and different ones
[2:07:30] they gathered over at the saw shop
[2:07:31] because that's where we'd hang out as
[2:07:33] young folks we'd hang out
[2:07:35] we'd get together birds of a feather
[2:07:37] flock together
[2:07:38] isn't that right well my feathers are
[2:07:40] changed better dad they really
[2:07:42] changed i got a bag of oranges like i
[2:07:45] went over there and
[2:07:47] they were like hey tom there have a bud
[2:07:50] i'm like nah i don't drink anymore
[2:07:52] no i got saved praise be to god
[2:07:56] here let's eat some oranges
[2:08:00] from my daughter i lost all my friends
[2:08:03] in the next three minutes
[2:08:06] oh my friends jumped in the car
[2:08:09] they got out of there yeah
[2:08:12] from the one telling everybody let's go
[2:08:14] party let's go do that and you know i
[2:08:16] became let's have some oranges and
[2:08:17] praise god praise goodness
[2:08:19] they don't want me no more living i was
[2:08:22] there by myself
[2:08:23] by myself i'm gonna do now
[2:08:27] you might not have any world friends but
[2:08:29] you'll have a friend
[2:08:31] that meant more to me than all the
[2:08:32] worldly friends i ever had
[2:08:35] because you've got a friend in jesus
[2:08:36] he'll stick with you
[2:08:38] through all eternity i'm a witness this
[2:08:40] morning brothers and sisters that
[2:08:41] god can change your life forever
[2:08:45] he can give you eternal life
[2:08:54] and that ghostly scary feeling in your
[2:08:57] life
[2:08:58] of condemnation and damnation
[2:09:02] you don't have to fear ferret anymore
[2:09:04] you don't have to be afraid
[2:09:06] why because he throws a life line in
[2:09:08] grab
[2:09:09] hold of this lifeline and you grab all
[2:09:11] over that lifeline
[2:09:15] right i gotta worry about it no more
[2:09:20] the day of god comes both cool
[2:09:23] and very vicious it's gonna be a
[2:09:25] horrible thing on the day of the lord
[2:09:26] but you don't have to fear judgment
[2:09:28] because paul said the saints will come
[2:09:31] the saints shall judge the world
[2:09:33] daniel said he comes with ten thousands
[2:09:35] of his sakes to judge the world
[2:09:38] we're there with christ when the ju when
[2:09:40] the world gets judged
[2:09:41] paul said you know and even jesus says
[2:09:44] there is now no
[2:09:45] condemnation to them that are in christ
[2:09:47] jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[2:09:49] after the spirit
[2:09:50] we've passed from death unto life and
[2:09:52] there's no judgment
[2:09:54] there's no condemnation to the believer
[2:09:56] why because you ever really stood the
[2:09:58] wrath of god
[2:09:59] jesus when he was died when he died last
[2:10:01] friday so to speak
[2:10:02] when he died on friday and when he was
[2:10:04] crucified
[2:10:06] that was god's wrath being poured out
[2:10:08] upon him
[2:10:09] and it should have been poured out on
[2:10:10] you and me
[2:10:13] the judgment of almighty god for our
[2:10:14] sins and he took our judgment for us
[2:10:17] we don't have to worry about that
[2:10:18] horrible sound that lonely feeling and
[2:10:20] that scary feeling of
[2:10:22] being condemned one of these days you
[2:10:23] don't have to feel that
[2:10:25] you can have peace jesus says i come to
[2:10:28] give you peace not like the world gives
[2:10:30] and jesus said come unto me all ye who
[2:10:32] are weary and heavy laden
[2:10:34] and i will give you rest there's no
[2:10:37] church should give you that
[2:10:38] not this church can't give you that only
[2:10:40] jesus christ can give you that
[2:10:42] rest and that satisfying drink that
[2:10:44] you'll
[2:10:45] drink from him and you'll never thirst
[2:10:47] again you'll never want to smoke and do
[2:10:49] all those things again you won't want to
[2:10:51] live for the world
[2:10:52] the only thing that you really care
[2:10:54] about after you get born again
[2:10:56] is doing what jesus said if you love me
[2:10:59] keep my commandments amen
[2:11:02] the commandments don't save you keeping
[2:11:04] the law don't save you
[2:11:05] but it shows that you love him amen
[2:11:11] the other thing about it when you come
[2:11:15] to the lord like i did when you come to
[2:11:16] the lord jesus christ
[2:11:18] i didn't go over there to my friends and
[2:11:20] say
[2:11:22] well now i just i don't want to tell you
[2:11:24] why but i can't do it
[2:11:28] i don't tell you why i don't want to
[2:11:30] drink but i want to do it
[2:11:33] now this is how i felt let me see if i
[2:11:38] can
[2:11:39] end it here
[2:11:46] in mark 8 and verse 34 whosoever will
[2:11:49] come after me let him deny himself
[2:11:51] take up his cross and follow him
[2:11:55] when you come to the lord you've got to
[2:11:56] be willing to forsake all
[2:11:58] when you come to the lord you can't
[2:12:00] worry about what mama daddy
[2:12:02] well if i come to the lord jesus my
[2:12:04] husband won't like me
[2:12:06] my wife won't like me for my boss it
[2:12:08] might fire me
[2:12:10] huh you can't worry about anybody else
[2:12:12] when you come to the lord jesus christ
[2:12:15] and you even got to die to yourself and
[2:12:18] i remember when i gave my heart to god i
[2:12:20] said lord jesus wherever you want me to
[2:12:21] go
[2:12:22] whatever you want me to do i'm willing
[2:12:24] to do it
[2:12:25] because that's what it takes for god to
[2:12:27] really be able to take you
[2:12:28] a complete sacrifice whosoever will save
[2:12:31] his life
[2:12:33] amen you want to do things your way yeah
[2:12:35] you can do it your way
[2:12:36] you can do whatever you want to do
[2:12:38] however you want to do it however long
[2:12:39] you want to do it but
[2:12:40] if you have that life you're going to
[2:12:42] lose it
[2:12:43] you'll come to an end but whosoever will
[2:12:46] lose his life for my sake in the gospels
[2:12:48] the same shall save it for what shall it
[2:12:51] profit a man if he shall gain the whole
[2:12:53] world
[2:12:53] and lose your own soul how many beliefs
[2:12:55] that's what we're here about this
[2:12:56] morning
[2:12:57] that's why we assemble this god what
[2:12:59] about my
[2:13:00] soul what about the you
[2:13:08] my brother our prophet went beyond the
[2:13:09] curtain of time god picked him up
[2:13:11] he's seen all the saints he's seen them
[2:13:13] all
[2:13:15] huh how many believes in there paul is
[2:13:17] gathered with his group
[2:13:19] irenaeus is gathered with his group
[2:13:22] their body may be in the grave some of
[2:13:24] them are eaten by lions
[2:13:26] many of them are burnt at the stake all
[2:13:28] those people their bodies are all gone
[2:13:30] but their soul
[2:13:31] is alive forever that's what we're
[2:13:34] concerned about this morning how
[2:13:36] is your soul where where will you spend
[2:13:40] eternity amen
[2:13:42] so i know notice here let's get to the
[2:13:44] point
[2:13:46] and lose his own soul or what will it
[2:13:48] give man give in exchange for his soul
[2:13:52] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[2:13:54] me and my words in this adulterous
[2:13:57] generation
[2:13:58] amen of him also shall the son of man be
[2:14:01] ashamed when he cometh
[2:14:02] in the glory of his father and all
[2:14:06] the holy angels one thing i'm not
[2:14:10] ashamed of never will be
[2:14:12] any that's why i proclaim the message
[2:14:14] they are because it isn't just about a
[2:14:15] man
[2:14:16] not just about a part but it's actually
[2:14:17] jesus christ that came
[2:14:19] and showed himself alive after 2 000
[2:14:22] years and
[2:14:23] going down through the dark ages
[2:14:24] catholicism almost had it all swallowed
[2:14:27] up
[2:14:28] they even burnt books you couldn't read
[2:14:30] you can do anything unless you was a
[2:14:32] catholic
[2:14:32] amen in this 1400s martin luther broke
[2:14:35] free and he says no i don't have to pay
[2:14:37] for my sins
[2:14:38] the just shall live by faith and he
[2:14:40] hacked the thesis on the wall and we had
[2:14:42] a reformation
[2:14:44] amen and we began to come out and
[2:14:46] believe the bible again and so forth in
[2:14:47] that right
[2:14:48] and here we are being able to believe
[2:14:49] the full word and not just a full word
[2:14:52] but in the midst of a place in the world
[2:14:54] where there's so many different ways god
[2:14:56] comes and he proves it
[2:14:58] with signs and infallible proofs that
[2:15:01] it's the truth
[2:15:02] and most of all the thing that makes it
[2:15:04] so infallible is it's 100
[2:15:06] according to the word of god it doesn't
[2:15:09] matter whether it's salvation baptism or
[2:15:11] whatever it might be it's all exactly
[2:15:13] the word of god and jesus commonly
[2:15:15] proved it he proved it over in africa
[2:15:17] he proved it in india proved it to
[2:15:21] 70 america went about 70 preachers here
[2:15:23] in america well known
[2:15:24] well renowned ministers that wanted to
[2:15:26] question brother branham on serpent seed
[2:15:28] in the godhead and so forth
[2:15:29] amen and then brother bannon was shown a
[2:15:32] vision of who would sit where and all of
[2:15:34] these other things and he told the
[2:15:35] brother
[2:15:36] amen he says you're not going to have
[2:15:37] the room that you think that you're
[2:15:38] going to have
[2:15:39] but there's going to be a certain person
[2:15:40] a certain and if that be
[2:15:42] exactly how it was they had that meeting
[2:15:45] and
[2:15:45] and and that brother come up he says now
[2:15:47] you might question about the ban
[2:15:49] doctrine and so forth but i'll tell you
[2:15:50] this one thing he told me that person
[2:15:52] would be sitting there
[2:15:52] that we wouldn't have that room long
[2:15:54] before we didn't even have it
[2:15:56] huh and brother baby says you know you
[2:15:59] come up and show me where the baptism is
[2:16:01] wrong or the godhead is wrong or these
[2:16:02] things and stand by my side
[2:16:04] because the angel of lord had told him
[2:16:06] come go ahead go and talk to him he says
[2:16:08] it's trap set for you
[2:16:10] but i'll be with you i'll be by your
[2:16:11] side by his right side
[2:16:15] amen but abram says you know the angel
[2:16:18] of the lord
[2:16:19] he believed that he would have struck
[2:16:20] him dead if they had come forward
[2:16:22] but it was a quiet bunch let me tell you
[2:16:25] something we have arisen corrupt we have
[2:16:26] arisen
[2:16:27] resurrected jesus christ thank the lord
[2:16:30] for it
[2:16:31] we can know what's right we can know the
[2:16:33] direction that we're going
[2:16:35] amen i'm so thankful for that oh i'm so
[2:16:38] thankful for that aren't you
[2:16:39] i'm not ashamed of the gospel i want to
[2:16:41] be a witness i want to testify that's
[2:16:44] what a witness does right
[2:16:45] he testifies of what god has done
[2:16:49] that god still calls god is still
[2:16:51] drawing

[2:16:55] there's something in our hearts
[2:16:57] that want to say that's what i want

[2:17:24] so much he cares more than we realize
[2:17:27] that he cares about us
[2:17:30] but the question is do you care

[2:17:36] don't care where it is
