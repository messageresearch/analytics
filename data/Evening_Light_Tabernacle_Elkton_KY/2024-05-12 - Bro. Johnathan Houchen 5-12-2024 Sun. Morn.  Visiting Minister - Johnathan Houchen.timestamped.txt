[56:19] sisters get up and
[56:20] sing the
[56:22] power there's power in the name of Jesus
[56:26] then another couple gets up and they
[56:29] sing he came looking for
[56:31] me that was some confirmation for me I
[56:34] couldn't have handpicked those two songs
[56:36] any better if I had
[56:38] to but I'd just like to say uh Happy
[56:41] Mother's Day first of all um it's a
[56:44] privilege to be here uh with you guys on
[56:47] on Mother's Day and
[56:50] uh
[56:53] um it's an honor to be here uh I was a
[56:56] little surprised when when brother
[56:58] Thomas text me and was like hey can you
[57:00] come take uh well was first it was
[57:02] Wednesday night service and and uh I was
[57:05] like yeah yeah I can and then the storms
[57:08] hit and I guess you guys had some
[57:09] flooding and some tornado warnings
[57:12] coming through and so we canceled that
[57:13] and he's like what about Sunday morning
[57:16] I sure I can do Sunday morning so I uh
[57:19] yesterday I don't have a whole lot of
[57:21] problems with my allergies but yesterday
[57:23] Mercy they hit and I was like man and I
[57:26] was thinking Lord I hope I can sleep you
[57:28] know last night and you know it was it
[57:31] was a rough night but he he let me get a
[57:33] little bit of sleep and you know I
[57:35] thought the devil's fighting that hard
[57:38] to keep me from getting here something
[57:41] special is probably going to happen you
[57:43] know
[57:44] so
[57:49] Amen brother brother Thomas had also
[57:52] told me that you guys usually go an hour
[57:53] and a half on Wednesday and I thought
[57:56] man I'll do my best but then he said
[57:58] Sunday with three hours on Sunday
[57:59] morning right
[58:02] so yeah no it's uh like I said it's good
[58:06] to be here um met a few of you at a
[58:08] picnic three three four weeks ago and
[58:12] and I really just enjoyed the time with
[58:14] you and looking forward to this morning
[58:16] and and um yes so uh I may be uh a
[58:22] little different maybe than some other
[58:26] you've had I tell everybody I'm a I'm a
[58:29] message preacher that wears a tape boy
[58:32] pen he called out A peculiar people
[58:34] though right I believe brother brandham
[58:36] called us oddballs I don't know that I
[58:38] can get any more Oddball than a message
[58:40] preacher that wears a tape boy P so uh
[58:43] you all pray for me and and um we'll get
[58:46] through it but uh if you have your
[58:48] bibles if we could turn to Luke 8 we're
[58:52] going to read 38 and 39
[59:12] Luke 8 38 and
[59:16] 39 now the man out of whom the Devils
[59:19] were departed besought him that he might
[59:22] be with him but Jesus sent him away
[59:25] saying turn to thine own house and show
[59:29] how great things God hath done unto thee
[59:32] and he went his way and published
[59:34] throughout the whole city how great
[59:37] things Jesus had done unto
[59:39] him return to thine own house and show
[59:43] how great things God hath done unto thee
[59:46] let's also turn to Second Timothy 1:7
[1:00:03] probably familiar to to to some of
[1:00:06] you second Timothy 1:7 For God hath not
[1:00:11] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[1:00:14] and of love and of a sound
[1:00:17] mind let's
[1:00:20] pray dear heavenly father Lord as we
[1:00:23] come before you once again Lord Lord
[1:00:25] just thankful for this this this place
[1:00:27] to be able to come in and assemble
[1:00:28] ourselves together Lord and fellowship

[1:00:32] Precious Faith father Lord I just pray
[1:00:35] that you would just come in Lord I've
[1:00:37] your spirit has felt so strongly already
[1:00:40] Lord I just pray that you would just
[1:00:42] continue to have your way in this
[1:00:44] service Lord Lord I pray that I would
[1:00:46] just get completely out of the way
[1:00:48] father that your Holy Spirit Lord would
[1:00:50] just shine through me father and just
[1:00:52] say whatever you would want me to say
[1:00:54] Lord Lord if I go to say something that
[1:00:57] you don't want me to say or that would
[1:00:59] be displeasing to you father I pray you
[1:01:00] would just shut my mouth Lord Lord I
[1:01:03] pray that you would just take complete
[1:01:04] and total control of this service have

[1:01:10] would like for me to say and I pray that
[1:01:11] you would anoint the ones here to hear

[1:01:16] we love you and we just thank you for
[1:01:18] all that you do in Jesus name I pray
[1:01:21] amen you can be seated thank you I'm
[1:01:24] going to take this jacket off if that's
[1:01:25] okay okay and get a little bit more
[1:01:30] comfortable you know as I was thinking
[1:01:32] about what I was going to speak on and
[1:01:35] knowing that today is Mother's
[1:01:37] Day I don't know if there's any Mothers
[1:01:40] here that maybe have had some children
[1:01:45] that have gone astray or maybe you're
[1:01:47] sitting here now and you've got some
[1:01:49] children that have gone astray and
[1:01:51] you've been praying for them but I'd
[1:01:53] like for you to hold that in your heart
[1:01:56] as we talk about this subject that I'm
[1:01:58] going to speak on I know you guys don't
[1:02:01] know me and uh so I
[1:02:04] thought instead of really preaching to
[1:02:07] you this morning I'm going to give you a
[1:02:09] couple
[1:02:11] testimonies so I want to read a
[1:02:15] quote this is uh
[1:02:19] 1950 believest thou
[1:02:22] this the first day passed oh my how dark
[1:02:27] second day passed dark Third Day fourth
[1:02:30] day all hopes was gone he's already a
[1:02:33] rotting in the grave and the skin worms
[1:02:36] was going through him all hopes was gone
[1:02:39] everywhere discouraged their pastor had
[1:02:41] let them down their loved one The
[1:02:44] Miracle Worker had let them down didn't
[1:02:47] come to the rescue and there was Mary
[1:02:50] and Martha left alone mother and father
[1:02:52] gone now just them two girls left alone
[1:02:55] in the world World someone come along to
[1:02:57] encourage them they sat in
[1:03:00] sackcloth Black Veils and weeping and
[1:03:02] mourning over their brother and now in
[1:03:05] their very darkest of hours then Jesus
[1:03:08] came
[1:03:09] along that's just the way he does it
[1:03:12] Amen brother it may be your darkest hour
[1:03:16] right now but Jesus comes along just at
[1:03:19] those at the darkest of hour when I
[1:03:22] think of it the darkest The Darkest Hour
[1:03:25] the woman with the blood issue had ever
[1:03:26] seen she spent all of her money then
[1:03:29] Jesus come along it was the darkest of
[1:03:32] hour that Jas had ever seen his little
[1:03:35] daughter lay dead then Jesus come along
[1:03:39] it was the darkest of hour that Peter
[1:03:41] and the apostles had ever seen on the
[1:03:43] sea looked like they was going to drown
[1:03:47] then Jesus came
[1:03:51] along so I'm going to start off by
[1:03:53] talking to you a little bit I want to
[1:03:55] talk to you about this man that we just
[1:03:56] read about
[1:03:58] Legion and
[1:04:03] uh my
[1:04:04] title is Legion in
[1:04:08] me we're going to take a take a look at
[1:04:10] this man Legion that we don't know his
[1:04:13] name the Bible never tells us his name
[1:04:16] we just know this man as
[1:04:18] Legion and
[1:04:20] uh this man
[1:04:24] was living in a graveyard was living in
[1:04:29] the tombs amongst the tombs amongst the
[1:04:31] dead that's where this man was
[1:04:34] living he was
[1:04:36] naked he was cutting
[1:04:39] himself this was his
[1:04:43] life brother Brandon would talk about
[1:04:46] him and he would take this
[1:04:49] story and he
[1:04:53] would give us a little more Insight on
[1:04:56] it that this
[1:04:59] man was not always like
[1:05:02] this this man had a wife he had
[1:05:06] kids that from time to time this man
[1:05:09] would come to himself and he would
[1:05:11] remember I've got a wife and I've got
[1:05:15] kids I'm sure this man had a
[1:05:19] mother his mother was probably praying
[1:05:21] for him I don't know how many Mother's
[1:05:23] Days went by that she didn't hear from
[1:05:25] this man
[1:05:26] but I'm sure she was praying for him but
[1:05:29] he would come to himself and he would
[1:05:30] have these thoughts I had another life
[1:05:34] but he gotten himself into a a situation
[1:05:37] he gotten himself into a position he
[1:05:39] could not get himself out of he had made
[1:05:42] some choices in life that took him down
[1:05:44] a road so far he was powerless to turn
[1:05:49] around and come
[1:05:52] back brother Braham talked about that
[1:05:55] maybe he maybe he took a drink one day
[1:05:58] and a demon entered into
[1:06:01] him he goes home and he has to tell a
[1:06:04] lie to cover what he just did and
[1:06:06] another demon enters in then maybe he
[1:06:08] had to tell another lie to cover that
[1:06:10] lie and another
[1:06:11] demon and he just kept doing this until
[1:06:14] he was completely demon-possessed he got
[1:06:17] himself in this situation he could not
[1:06:20] get himself out of
[1:06:21] it so here he is in the grave in this
[1:06:24] graveyard naked cutting
[1:06:28] himself but one day as he was in that
[1:06:33] graveyard naked cutting himself being
[1:06:37] tormented by these
[1:06:39] demons there was a
[1:06:42] man on the other side of the
[1:06:45] sea that was about to enter into a
[1:06:48] boat this man had just preached to 5,000
[1:06:53] people and he was leaving every one of
[1:06:55] of them because there was
[1:06:58] one across the
[1:07:03] sea that before the foundation of the
[1:07:05] world had something placed in
[1:07:12] him Satan would do everything he could
[1:07:15] to stop this moment from
[1:07:17] happening he sent a legion of
[1:07:20] demons caused a storm to come upon that
[1:07:23] sea
[1:07:27] Jesus just spoke it out of
[1:07:29] existence because he was going to that
[1:07:32] one nothing was going to stop him from
[1:07:35] getting to that
[1:07:39] one as we look at this scene for a
[1:07:43] moment these disciples had probably rode
[1:07:47] through the night in this boat to get to
[1:07:50] the other side of the
[1:07:51] sea maybe it was Dawn about the time
[1:07:54] they got there
[1:07:56] as they pull up onto the
[1:07:58] shore Jesus steps out the disciples step
[1:08:02] out they're looking out
[1:08:05] here all they see is tombs maybe the sun
[1:08:09] is rising a bit behind them and the
[1:08:12] Shadows from these tombs are Long
[1:08:14] Shadows being CAU cast along the ground
[1:08:18] maybe the fog hasn't lifted quite yet
[1:08:21] it's a very eerie sight that they're
[1:08:23] looking at and I see as Jesus would
[1:08:26] start walking maybe the disciples
[1:08:29] thought we'll just get behind him this
[1:08:32] this doesn't look real real good as they
[1:08:36] fell in behind him see Legion was in
[1:08:40] there Legion had lost everything any job
[1:08:44] that he'd ever had any money that he'd
[1:08:46] ever made any house that he ever owned
[1:08:49] his wife his kids his mother his father
[1:08:52] everything he had lost
[1:08:54] everything this was this man's darkest
[1:08:57] hour and then Jesus
[1:09:02] came me he
[1:09:05] walks as he comes out of that boat and
[1:09:07] he starts walking here comes this man
[1:09:10] running out of the
[1:09:14] Grave to talk with him but it's not the
[1:09:17] man that's talking it's the demons
[1:09:20] talking out of this man they encounter
[1:09:24] Jesus
[1:09:26] what are you doing
[1:09:28] here you know I love Jesus I love the
[1:09:31] way he reacts in this moment he doesn't
[1:09:34] start
[1:09:35] screaming he doesn't start jumping up
[1:09:37] and down and raising his voice and
[1:09:40] speaking in
[1:09:41] tongues he just simply says
[1:09:45] go and just like that 2,000 demons leave
[1:09:49] this
[1:09:50] man this man that was in a position that
[1:09:54] he could not do anything to get out of
[1:09:58] in an
[1:09:58] instant That's The Power of Jesus
[1:10:04] Christ and as I can imagine this man
[1:10:07] Legion coming to himself for the first
[1:10:09] time and who knows how
[1:10:12] long thinking my
[1:10:15] goodness what kind of power this man
[1:10:19] possesses what kind of man is this and
[1:10:23] just like any of us knowing we don't
[1:10:26] really have anything to go back to we've
[1:10:28] destroyed anything that we've ever
[1:10:30] accomplished and ever had in our life
[1:10:32] we've destroyed it I'm going with you
[1:10:36] that's what he was thinking I'm going
[1:10:38] with this man right here and as Jesus
[1:10:42] gets into the boat and he turns and he
[1:10:44] looks at Legion and he
[1:10:45] says return to thine own
[1:10:50] home I'm sure Legion is thinking or wait
[1:10:53] a minute
[1:10:55] I know what you just did for me but
[1:10:58] maybe you don't quite understand what
[1:11:00] I've done to
[1:11:02] others there's no way that I can return
[1:11:07] home there's nobody there that loves me
[1:11:10] they certainly don't trust me there's no
[1:11:14] possible way that I can return
[1:11:17] home and Jesus says return to thine own
[1:11:21] home and show them the things God has
[1:11:25] done for
[1:11:29] you so as I'm sure that as he starts to
[1:11:33] walk home maybe he had an old pair of
[1:11:36] clothes or something that was stashed
[1:11:37] somewhere amongst the tombs and he threw
[1:11:39] some Rags
[1:11:41] on probably put his hands in his pockets
[1:11:44] head was down as he was walking back to
[1:11:47] his
[1:11:48] house the people seeing him come were
[1:11:51] the same ones that had tried to chain
[1:11:53] him and tie him up because he' try to
[1:11:56] hurt people and I'm sure these people as
[1:11:58] they would see him coming would cross to
[1:12:00] the other side of the street thinking
[1:12:03] yikes that that's that's that man
[1:12:06] right he does at least have clothes on
[1:12:08] but that is him they're getting away
[1:12:11] from him and I'm sure he's just thinking
[1:12:14] just get back to your my house just get
[1:12:17] me back to my
[1:12:19] house and as he gets to his
[1:12:22] house he notices that it's empty
[1:12:28] because this
[1:12:30] man that was a husband that was a father
[1:12:36] hasn't been around to pay the
[1:12:37] bills he hasn't been around to help his
[1:12:45] family so he sees this house that he
[1:12:49] once had and it's sitting
[1:12:51] empty maybe he asked somebody have you
[1:12:53] seen the people that that lived here in
[1:12:55] this
[1:12:56] house they yeah they're they're down
[1:12:59] here in this this alley down here so he
[1:13:03] starts walking down the alley and looks
[1:13:05] up and all of a sudden he sees his wife
[1:13:08] he sees his
[1:13:09] kids so he starts walking towards them
[1:13:12] he notices their clothes are ratty
[1:13:16] they're torn they're dirty they don't
[1:13:19] have
[1:13:20] anything they see him
[1:13:22] coming they turn to run
[1:13:25] he says hold on just a second please
[1:13:27] wait just one just just one second kids
[1:13:31] probably ran and got behind
[1:13:33] mom she's not sure what to do at this
[1:13:36] moment do I turn and run what do I do he
[1:13:39] says give me just just one minute so I
[1:13:42] want to tell you I want to tell you
[1:13:45] something see Daddy met Jesus
[1:13:51] today and I want to tell you about it
[1:13:55] I want to tell you what happened to me
[1:13:59] today as they stand there and they talk
[1:14:01] for just a few
[1:14:03] minutes she's noticing something seems
[1:14:07] different something seems a little
[1:14:09] different he says can I just have dinner
[1:14:12] with you she reluctantly
[1:14:15] agrees so they go into the Little Shack
[1:14:17] she prepares dinner they sit down at the
[1:14:19] table which they haven't done in a long
[1:14:21] time and he starts to tell them
[1:14:25] what happened to him that day what what
[1:14:27] his life had been like and how he he'd
[1:14:30] met a man today that changed
[1:14:33] him they're sitting there looking at him
[1:14:36] she's not sure what to
[1:14:39] do night starts to get come around and
[1:14:43] he asks can I put the kids to bed I
[1:14:46] haven't done that in a long
[1:14:48] time she says okay she's watching him
[1:14:51] very carefully there's no trust here
[1:14:54] there's no love love here he puts the
[1:14:57] kids to bed kisses them good night
[1:15:00] hasn't done this in a long time he comes
[1:15:03] back out with his wife they're standing
[1:15:05] there they talk for a little bit
[1:15:08] longer he's just asking her give me a
[1:15:13] chance just give me a
[1:15:16] chance she's thinking about this and
[1:15:19] night is fallen and it's time to go to
[1:15:22] bed he looks over in the corner of the
[1:15:24] room and there's one bed and he looks at
[1:15:26] her and he can read all over her face if
[1:15:29] you think you're getting in that bed
[1:15:31] with me you've lost your
[1:15:34] mind we've got a covered porch we'll
[1:15:37] make you a bed out there you can sleep
[1:15:40] out there he agrees to
[1:15:43] this so that night when he goes out
[1:15:45] there he's got his bed ready and maybe
[1:15:50] he kneels down for the first time in a
[1:15:52] very long time to pray
[1:15:57] and all of a sudden it starts to sink
[1:15:59] in he didn't just say go tell them he
[1:16:04] said go show
[1:16:06] them and he starts that's that really
[1:16:08] starts to sink in this go show them that
[1:16:12] might take a little while to do
[1:16:16] this and so he says his
[1:16:19] [Music]
[1:16:21] prayer he uh
[1:16:25] gets up the next morning maybe gets up a
[1:16:28] little bit earlier he goes and he fixes
[1:16:31] breakfast for his
[1:16:33] family wife gets up kids get up they're
[1:16:36] thinking wow this is definitely
[1:16:38] different for sure so they eat breakfast
[1:16:41] he talks with him for a little bit and
[1:16:44] he says uh I'll be back in a little
[1:16:47] while there's something I've got to go
[1:16:49] do as he walks out the door there's a
[1:16:52] little crate sitting on the porch and he
[1:16:54] picks up that that crate he starts
[1:16:56] walking to the middle of the
[1:16:58] city his wife looks out the window she's
[1:17:02] thinking what in the world is he
[1:17:04] doing maybe she thinks I'm just gonna
[1:17:06] follow him from
[1:17:08] afar because I want to see what he's
[1:17:11] doing and she's watching him walk to the
[1:17:14] city he's got this crate maybe she's
[1:17:18] thinking wonder if he's going back to
[1:17:20] the same bar that he used to go to maybe
[1:17:24] he's going to take that crate and fill
[1:17:26] it with bottles of alcohol maybe that's
[1:17:29] what he's doing he's going to try to
[1:17:30] come back and hide it somewhere at the
[1:17:32] house but as she watches
[1:17:35] him walks into the middle of the
[1:17:38] city he sets that crate down he gets up
[1:17:42] on top of
[1:17:44] it and he says people of
[1:17:47] GAD come let me tell you about a man
[1:17:50] that changed my life I want to show you
[1:17:53] what this man did for me
[1:17:56] me and even though he's going to have
[1:17:59] critics the rest of his life he's going
[1:18:02] to have critics because there's going to
[1:18:03] people be people say you did not deserve
[1:18:07] what he did for you there's no way that
[1:18:10] he took somebody that was that evil and
[1:18:13] changed you to this person over here
[1:18:16] it's not
[1:18:18] possible but I guarantee you that he
[1:18:21] stood on that box for the rest of his
[1:18:23] life and you ask me
[1:18:25] why would I say that how would I know
[1:18:27] that because he came in contact with
[1:18:30] Jesus Christ that's the power of Christ
[1:18:34] he can change somebody from here and
[1:18:37] make them this person over here because
[1:18:40] he works in the impossible that's what
[1:18:42] he does is The
[1:18:45] Impossible what did he do for Legion he
[1:18:48] gave him power he put love in his heart
[1:18:52] and he gave him a sound mind
[1:18:55] Legion was not worthy of any of this
[1:18:58] there was nothing Legion could do to
[1:19:01] deserve what happened but he was born
[1:19:06] differently he looked like a vessel of
[1:19:09] Wrath but he was a vessel of
[1:19:13] Mercy it ta took the light from the S so
[1:19:17] n to hit that seed that had been planted
[1:19:21] in him and once it did it changed his
[1:19:24] life life forever he will never go back
[1:19:27] to that again from that moment on he
[1:19:30] will walk different he'll talk different
[1:19:33] he'll think different he'll pray
[1:19:35] different he was a different
[1:19:44] person that's the testimony of
[1:19:47] Legion I told you I wanted to tell you a
[1:19:49] couple of
[1:19:51] testimonies so I'm going to tell you a
[1:19:52] little bit about me
[1:19:55] you guys don't know me so this is going
[1:19:56] to be a real good way for you to get to
[1:19:58] know
[1:20:01] me so Legion and
[1:20:04] me found ourselves in a very similar
[1:20:08] situation now I will say that I didn't
[1:20:13] have a couple thousand demons in me my
[1:20:16] wife sitting right there may disagree
[1:20:18] with
[1:20:20] that but Legion and I found ourselves in
[1:20:24] a very similar
[1:20:26] situation found ourselves in a situation
[1:20:29] that we could not get ourselves out of
[1:20:32] I'm going to read you another quote this
[1:20:33] is from the church age
[1:20:37] book Here and Now set forth the love of
[1:20:40] God he desired in love a family of his
[1:20:43] own a family of Sons Sons like
[1:20:47] himself there be there before him lies
[1:20:50] all mankind as a lump as one lump of
[1:20:53] clay out of that that same lump he will
[1:20:56] now make vessels unto honor and unto
[1:20:59] dishonor the choosing will be his own
[1:21:01] choosing then those chosen ones born of
[1:21:04] his spirit will be trained and conformed
[1:21:07] to His Image in their walk he reproves
[1:21:10] with all longsuffering and gentleness
[1:21:13] and mercy he chastens with nail scarred
[1:21:16] hands sometimes this Potter must take
[1:21:19] the vessel he is working on and
[1:21:21] thoroughly break it down in order that
[1:21:24] he may rebuild it exactly as he desires
[1:21:27] it but it is love that is his love
[1:21:32] another way of his love there is not
[1:21:34] there cannot
[1:21:36] be these
[1:21:39] vessels that brother bram's talking
[1:21:41] about here are mentioned in Romans
[1:21:43] nine they're also regarded as vessels of
[1:21:47] Wrath and vessels of
[1:21:50] Mercy that God
[1:21:53] knew before the foundation of the world
[1:21:56] by his foresight he could look down
[1:21:59] through time and he knew who was going
[1:22:02] to choose this and who was going to
[1:22:04] choose
[1:22:06] this jacob have I loved Esau have I
[1:22:09] hated and they had not been born yet but
[1:22:12] he knew by predestination who was going
[1:22:15] to be who vessels of Wrath vessels of
[1:22:19] Mercy
[1:22:21] Mercy vessels of honor and of
[1:22:27] dishonor in
[1:22:35] 1997 we went me and my wife which was
[1:22:38] not my wife at this point we went to
[1:22:41] some
[1:22:42] meetings that brother Billy Paul Branham
[1:22:44] was holding in
[1:22:46] Pennsylvania and I was seeking the Holy
[1:22:51] Ghost I would have been 20 years old
[1:22:55] and uh we get to these meetings and
[1:22:59] brother
[1:23:00] Billy he did a prayer line and I went
[1:23:03] through this prayer line and I told
[1:23:05] Brother Billy I remember telling him I
[1:23:06] need the Holy Ghost so bad that's what I
[1:23:08] told
[1:23:09] him and I remember the prayer that he
[1:23:11] prayed with me I'll never forget that
[1:23:13] prayer I'll never forget what he said
[1:23:16] but it was in that
[1:23:18] moment there was a lot of
[1:23:21] emotion that that took place there and I
[1:23:25] thought that I had received the Holy
[1:23:27] Ghost but I
[1:23:32] hadn't the very following year in 1998
[1:23:36] me and my wife got married that's been
[1:23:39] almost it' be 26 years ago next
[1:23:43] Thursday now I want you guys to keep in
[1:23:47] mind that we were born and raised in the
[1:23:49] message both of us were we both went to
[1:23:53] the brandham Tabernacle for years and it
[1:23:56] meant absolutely nothing for us and I
[1:24:00] don't say that to say something
[1:24:02] derogatory about the Bram Tabernacle I
[1:24:05] love the Bram Tabernacle Bram Tabernacle
[1:24:07] will always mean a lot to me that's
[1:24:09] where I got my
[1:24:12] Foundation but it meant nothing to me
[1:24:16] because I didn't have a relationship
[1:24:18] with
[1:24:20] Christ I knew the
[1:24:22] pastor I was at the brandham Tabernacle
[1:24:26] but I had no relationship with Christ
[1:24:29] see I've seen people come from the
[1:24:32] Baptist from Pentecostal I've seen them
[1:24:33] come from Catholic and I've seen them
[1:24:36] come into the message I've seen people
[1:24:39] that are in the message that you would
[1:24:41] never in a million years think would
[1:24:43] leave the message and I've watched them
[1:24:44] walk away and not just walk away but
[1:24:47] then turn around and attack this message
[1:24:50] why because they didn't have a
[1:24:52] relationship with Christ they had a head
[1:24:55] knowledge of the message and they had
[1:24:57] nothing in
[1:25:01] here so both of us born and raised in
[1:25:04] the
[1:25:05] message we get married
[1:25:10] 1998 and I remember and I'm just G to be
[1:25:13] transparent with you guys a little bit
[1:25:14] here I hope that's
[1:25:16] okay I remember the first fight that me
[1:25:18] and our my wife got into was on our
[1:25:21] honeymoon got into a fight over money
[1:25:25] and I mean it wasn't just a little fight
[1:25:26] I mean it was a fight we didn't talk to
[1:25:28] each other for half the day we were
[1:25:31] there this just kept getting worse and
[1:25:35] worse as time went
[1:25:38] by we had pictures hanging on our wall
[1:25:41] in weird places but they were to cover
[1:25:43] the holes from where things would get
[1:25:47] thrown this relationship just continued
[1:25:50] to get worse the fighting just continued
[1:25:52] to get worse five years into our
[1:25:55] marriage my wife gets pregnant with our
[1:25:58] first
[1:25:59] child this is also the same time we
[1:26:02] separate for the first
[1:26:04] time and you guys can imagine how well
[1:26:07] that went I am supposedly a message
[1:26:10] believer and I have just left my
[1:26:12] pregnant
[1:26:13] wife you can imagine the phone calls I
[1:26:16] was
[1:26:17] getting I didn't
[1:26:19] care I didn't there was nothing inside
[1:26:23] of me to care to to make me care about
[1:26:26] anything I didn't
[1:26:28] care we ended up patching things up we
[1:26:31] get back
[1:26:32] together seven years in now we have two
[1:26:35] girls we have Camilia is my oldest Alina
[1:26:39] is our youngest and they are 10 and a
[1:26:41] half months
[1:26:44] apart my problem
[1:26:46] was I didn't know how to show
[1:26:50] love it would be like me grabbing
[1:26:54] somebody around the
[1:26:56] throat holding them up against the wall
[1:26:58] and shaking them and saying why can't
[1:27:01] you see that I love
[1:27:03] you that's the way I would express it I
[1:27:05] didn't know how to show
[1:27:09] love seven years in two kids now
[1:27:13] fighting continues just keeps getting
[1:27:16] worse we had been going to
[1:27:19] church but now our lifestyle starts to
[1:27:21] change a little bit and we start moving
[1:27:23] away from church a
[1:27:25] bit as we start doing this the more we
[1:27:29] move away from church the more people
[1:27:31] back away from us I've said this many
[1:27:34] times I'll say it to you guys as well
[1:27:36] this is something we've got to get
[1:27:37] better at in the
[1:27:39] message somebody starts to go down the
[1:27:42] wrong path the worst thing you can do is
[1:27:45] go the opposite way now I don't mean go
[1:27:48] out and go to the bar with these people
[1:27:50] but check on them show them love
[1:27:55] now I'm not saying that that's what my
[1:27:57] problem was and I'm not saying that
[1:27:58] would have changed anything but that's a
[1:28:00] problem we need to get better
[1:28:03] at so as we continue fighting and start
[1:28:06] moving away from church
[1:28:10] and again our problem
[1:28:13] was we had no relationship with Jesus
[1:28:22] Christ so
[1:28:25] this continues and continues and one day
[1:28:28] I had a friend of mine just so you guys
[1:28:31] know I am a general contractor by trade
[1:28:33] that is what I do so I had a a plumber
[1:28:36] friend of mine that did work for me from
[1:28:38] time to time and uh I needed a new water
[1:28:41] heater so I called him up and and uh he
[1:28:46] came over to to to change out our water
[1:28:48] heater I help him get it out of the
[1:28:49] house and as he's putting in the new one
[1:28:51] I'm out in the front yard draining out
[1:28:53] the old one
[1:28:54] I come in to hear him this man's name is
[1:28:57] David by the way and I want you to
[1:28:58] remember this man's name David
[1:29:01] okay I come in and David is talking to
[1:29:04] my wife about marriage classes I'm like
[1:29:06] oh my goodness gracious he goes to a
[1:29:09] mega church and I'm thinking yeah that's
[1:29:12] what we need is marriage classes from a
[1:29:14] mega church because I mean we're message
[1:29:17] Believers we don't need marriage classes
[1:29:20] from a mega church but as David
[1:29:22] continues to talk
[1:29:25] I finally reluctantly say fine we'll go
[1:29:28] to some marriage classes so we did go
[1:29:32] and they were
[1:29:33] helpful unfortunately it was like
[1:29:36] putting a Band-Aid on this gaping
[1:29:41] wound and
[1:29:44] so we keep going down this
[1:29:47] path we keep pulling away from
[1:29:52] church other parents didn't necessarily
[1:29:55] want our their kids hanging out with our
[1:29:57] kids because we weren't in church all
[1:29:59] the time we started looking a little
[1:30:02] different from other
[1:30:04] people and as you start moving down this
[1:30:07] path you will finally hit a
[1:30:13] moment anger starts to build anger
[1:30:17] towards your spouse anger towards
[1:30:21] church anger starts building
[1:30:24] and you'll get to a
[1:30:26] point where you're you just think I just
[1:30:30] thought
[1:30:32] God I've done I've I've I've I've been
[1:30:35] in the
[1:30:37] message but it's it hasn't helped me
[1:30:40] there's nothing is helping me I'm
[1:30:42] watching my family just slide this way
[1:30:44] we're going this way we're we're losing
[1:30:46] our friends everything is falling
[1:30:48] apart if you're not going to help me I
[1:30:51] don't need you
[1:30:54] and then when you cross that line right
[1:30:56] there now it's extremely hard to back
[1:30:59] up and then Satan has got you right
[1:31:03] where he wants
[1:31:04] you because see now Satan will just
[1:31:07] start feeding you things just a little
[1:31:10] bit at a time just a little bit at a
[1:31:13] time what something something very small
[1:31:15] doesn't seem like much you you take that
[1:31:18] and then he's here just a little bit
[1:31:20] further just keep coming a little bit
[1:31:22] further and you just keep grabbing and
[1:31:25] grabbing and as a message believer
[1:31:28] you'll start doing things that you never
[1:31:31] would have thought that you would ever
[1:31:33] do but you just keep
[1:31:37] moving in that
[1:31:41] direction so Satan now has us right
[1:31:45] where he wants
[1:31:47] us we're not praying
[1:31:51] anymore we're not going to
[1:31:54] Church our friends of all but
[1:31:57] gone but see the thing is is every one
[1:32:00] of us is born with that that little
[1:32:03] hole and if you don't fill it with him
[1:32:06] you're going to fill it with something
[1:32:09] and so he just keeps handing you more
[1:32:11] and more and
[1:32:14] more and things just keep getting worse
[1:32:17] and worse and worse because I can tell
[1:32:19] you that there's never a point where
[1:32:21] Satan has your best interest at heart
[1:32:24] he is trying to break you down he is
[1:32:26] trying to destroy everything about you
[1:32:28] that he can destroy it looks like fun
[1:32:32] until everything's
[1:32:35] gone so as we just keep moving in this
[1:32:38] direction we just keep getting worse and
[1:32:42] worse kids are starting to grow up the
[1:32:45] fighting is still going on it's it's
[1:32:47] getting worse than
[1:32:48] ever our kids are about 13 14 years
[1:32:52] old and I come home home one day and my
[1:32:55] youngest daughter says something about
[1:32:57] my wife had mentioned
[1:32:59] divorce I thought really okay because in
[1:33:04] my mind I've done the things that I'm
[1:33:07] supposed to do I'm supposed to be a
[1:33:10] provider which I had
[1:33:12] done anything that they wanted I got it
[1:33:15] for them house cars whatever I had done
[1:33:19] my part as far as being a provider
[1:33:21] that's in my mind that's what I was
[1:33:22] supposed to do and I had done that so if
[1:33:25] you want a divorce fine we'll get a
[1:33:27] divorce let's see how you do without me
[1:33:30] so I remembered that day she came home
[1:33:32] and I asked her that question she said
[1:33:34] yes I I'd mentioned that I said okay I'm
[1:33:37] gone so I packed a couple
[1:33:40] bags and this was the second time we
[1:33:42] split up I walked out the door had no
[1:33:46] idea where I was going had no idea where
[1:33:49] I was even going to
[1:33:51] live walked out the door
[1:33:54] believe it was two days
[1:33:57] later that my wife called my one and
[1:34:01] only friend at that time his name was
[1:34:04] Rob now I'm going to give you a little
[1:34:06] background to Rob okay Rob was a man
[1:34:10] that also went to that same mega church
[1:34:13] Rob was a divorced man he was not living
[1:34:16] right
[1:34:18] himself a couple years prior to this
[1:34:20] moment that I'm talking about about me
[1:34:21] walking out is when I had met Rob
[1:34:24] me and Rob became pretty good friends we
[1:34:26] did the same line of work we were both
[1:34:28] contractors we ended up going to Houston
[1:34:31] Texas together for a while to do work
[1:34:33] when the economy got really bad while we
[1:34:36] were in Houston
[1:34:38] Texas Rob ter goes to Joe olin's church
[1:34:43] he
[1:34:44] visits anybody here doesn't know who Joe
[1:34:47] Olstein is he's a very wealthy Pastor
[1:34:50] that preaches prosperity
[1:34:55] Rob goes to Joel olin's church I would
[1:34:59] have never met Rob except for the fact
[1:35:01] that that man that I talked about David
[1:35:04] the
[1:35:05] plumber what's my point to
[1:35:09] this that
[1:35:10] he will use
[1:35:13] anybody that he wants in any manner that
[1:35:16] he wants to get to one of
[1:35:20] his I never meet Rob without
[1:35:24] David Rob never turns his heart his life
[1:35:27] around and gives his heart back to the
[1:35:29] Lord without Joel
[1:35:31] Olstein he does not miss a
[1:35:34] detail these were the people that he
[1:35:36] placed in my life because he knew I was
[1:35:39] going to need these people he doesn't
[1:35:42] miss a
[1:35:44] detail so my wife calls my friend my one
[1:35:47] and only friend Rob she tells him what's
[1:35:50] going on we have no idea why she did
[1:35:52] this this is something that I just call
[1:35:55] her a moment because we don't know why
[1:35:57] she did it she despised
[1:36:00] me there was nothing about me she liked
[1:36:06] she had made the remark many times it
[1:36:08] would be better for her to live alone
[1:36:09] than it would be with me she felt alone
[1:36:12] with me
[1:36:14] anyways so Rob gives me a call he ask me
[1:36:18] what's going on I didn't even really
[1:36:21] want to get into it with him to be
[1:36:22] honest with you but he kept prying so I
[1:36:24] started telling him what was
[1:36:27] happening well long story short he asked
[1:36:31] me he said if I can get her to sit down
[1:36:34] with us would you come and sit down with
[1:36:36] me I was like sure whatever it's not
[1:36:39] going to help anything it's not going to
[1:36:41] fix anything she's not even GNA
[1:36:43] come so he gets her she agrees so we
[1:36:47] both agree to sit down with my my friend
[1:36:50] Rob now
[1:36:56] we meet at this little restaurant about
[1:36:59] lunchtime and I remember at least three
[1:37:01] times Rob having to tell me to calm down
[1:37:04] because I was actually starting to draw
[1:37:06] attention to the table because I was
[1:37:08] getting so
[1:37:10] loud this meeting here went absolutely
[1:37:15] horrible but during this meeting I
[1:37:18] remember Rob asking her what's the pro
[1:37:21] what do you think the problem is and her
[1:37:24] answer was is he does not respect me he
[1:37:27] does not respect my opinion on
[1:37:30] anything Rob looks at me and he says is
[1:37:33] that true and I remember playing as day
[1:37:36] saying yes that's very accurate I don't
[1:37:40] respect her and I don't respect her
[1:37:41] opinion and even in that moment I still
[1:37:44] did not think there was anything wrong
[1:37:46] with that whatsoever because I wasn't
[1:37:48] the problem she was it wasn't me it was
[1:37:51] her I was I had done my part I was the
[1:37:56] provider as we're having this moment I
[1:38:00] remember looking across the table at my
[1:38:02] my friend
[1:38:03] Rob I see tears starting to run down his
[1:38:08] face and I start thinking to myself
[1:38:10] you've got to be kidding me my one and
[1:38:13] my only friend and now she's got him
[1:38:15] suckered in she's got him on her
[1:38:20] side I just get more angry
[1:38:24] we end up leaving the
[1:38:26] restaurant storming out it was
[1:38:30] terrible about two weeks after that Rob
[1:38:34] kind of trying to talk to me a little
[1:38:37] bit from the time we left there and till
[1:38:39] this moment I'm getting ready to tell
[1:38:41] you
[1:38:43] about two weeks after this as I said I'm
[1:38:47] a contractor and in that moment I had a
[1:38:49] lot of work and I didn't have enough
[1:38:51] people to do the work
[1:38:53] so I had a customer that was wanting a
[1:38:55] floor job done they weren't going to be
[1:38:58] home I didn't have enough guys to come
[1:39:00] help me with it so I went to this house
[1:39:02] by
[1:39:04] myself I get in there and I start laying
[1:39:06] the floor I get on my
[1:39:08] knees it's interesting the things that
[1:39:11] can happen when you get on your
[1:39:14] knees you see I was in a moment right
[1:39:18] here I didn't know what I was going to
[1:39:20] do I didn't know where I was going to go
[1:39:22] I didn't know where I was going to live
[1:39:24] truth be told I was thinking about
[1:39:26] moving to
[1:39:27] Florida and as I'm going through these
[1:39:30] thoughts in my mind I had one friend
[1:39:34] left I had lost my family my wife my
[1:39:38] kids they wanted nothing to do with
[1:39:41] me this right here was my darkest
[1:39:45] hour and then Jesus
[1:39:52] came you see as I was on my knees laying
[1:39:56] that floor I can't explain to you what
[1:39:58] happened all I can tell you is that in a
[1:40:02] moment I found myself arguing with
[1:40:06] myself over was it my fault or
[1:40:09] hers and it took all of about 30 seconds
[1:40:14] for him to take a 40-year-old man men
[1:40:19] don't
[1:40:20] change it took him about 30 seconds to
[1:40:23] to change the heart of a 40-year-old man
[1:40:26] right there in that
[1:40:30] moment that's the power of Jesus
[1:40:33] Christ I didn't understand what was
[1:40:36] going
[1:40:37] on but I got up off the floor I
[1:40:41] immediately called my buddy Rob now
[1:40:44] there's tears running down my face I'm
[1:40:46] telling him what's going on he's blown
[1:40:49] away he doesn't even know what to say
[1:40:53] he
[1:40:54] says you need to go
[1:40:57] home you need to talk to them return to
[1:41:02] thine own
[1:41:04] home so unlike Legion I didn't know what
[1:41:07] had happened here but I can tell you
[1:41:09] that Daddy had just met Jesus for the
[1:41:11] first
[1:41:15] time so I text my wife and I asked her
[1:41:19] can I meet with you for just a couple
[1:41:21] minutes she said says yes so I go
[1:41:26] home the kids were in another
[1:41:29] room and I remember getting her and
[1:41:32] setting her down on the couch and taking
[1:41:35] her by the hands and getting down on my
[1:41:39] knees and ask her to forgive
[1:41:43] me as tears are streaming down my face
[1:41:46] and I look up at her brother Thomas it's
[1:41:49] blank there's
[1:41:51] nothing and I all of a sudden I'm
[1:41:54] thinking this might take a
[1:41:57] while because just like Legion I'm
[1:41:59] coming to a home where there's no love
[1:42:02] and there's absolutely no trust
[1:42:06] whatsoever
[1:42:08] so after we get done talking we talk to
[1:42:12] my buddy
[1:42:14] Rob he asked her to see to save money if
[1:42:17] I could move into the basement of our
[1:42:21] house of my house
[1:42:24] so I
[1:42:25] agree to move into the basement the
[1:42:29] unfinished basement of my
[1:42:32] house I had concrete walls a concrete
[1:42:36] floor and that was
[1:42:39] it and I know you brothers are probably
[1:42:42] sitting here thinking that man lost his
[1:42:45] mind but I tell you it was because I had
[1:42:48] met Jesus Christ is why I agreed to that
[1:42:52] because I had every
[1:42:54] right by message
[1:42:56] law to come into that house and say I'm
[1:43:00] the head of this
[1:43:02] house something happened to me and now
[1:43:06] you all are going to have to fall under
[1:43:08] my headship I had every right to do that
[1:43:12] but because I had met Jesus Christ
[1:43:15] something changed inside of here and so
[1:43:19] I agreed to live in an unfinished
[1:43:22] basement
[1:43:23] not knowing how long this was going to
[1:43:27] take so I started living in our
[1:43:30] basement the only time I would come
[1:43:33] upstairs is if I needed to use the
[1:43:35] restroom because there was nothing in
[1:43:37] the
[1:43:37] basement I had a television and a
[1:43:40] mattress that's what I had down there my
[1:43:44] oldest daughter Chamilia would come down
[1:43:46] pretty much on a daily basis at least
[1:43:48] once just to check on me just that's who
[1:43:51] she is
[1:43:54] I lived there for a little while week
[1:43:58] maybe
[1:43:59] two and
[1:44:01] we came to the to the decision that I
[1:44:04] would start having dinner with my family
[1:44:06] once a week so the only interaction we
[1:44:10] had was once a week I started to ask my
[1:44:13] wife out on a
[1:44:15] date I asked my own wife out on a date
[1:44:19] three times before she finally said yes
[1:44:24] we go out on a date and it goes
[1:44:29] horrible as we're sitting there at the
[1:44:32] table now this time she's the one
[1:44:35] getting
[1:44:37] vress she's doing everything she can to
[1:44:40] push my
[1:44:41] buttons but I didn't react to
[1:44:44] it so even though this date goes
[1:44:47] horribly wrong the one thing that
[1:44:51] happened was I didn't get up and
[1:44:54] leave because the old me would have got
[1:44:57] up walked out of the restaurant and left
[1:44:59] her there and she could have figured out
[1:45:01] how to get home but I just sit there I
[1:45:05] tried just to talk
[1:45:07] calmly and talk through
[1:45:10] this which was very
[1:45:12] different she had to have seen this and
[1:45:15] was thinking something's a little
[1:45:19] different but I was taking little steps
[1:45:23] just one foot in front of the other and
[1:45:26] he had a hold of my
[1:45:32] arm so as we continue to progress our
[1:45:38] relationship starts getting better I was
[1:45:42] in the basement for four months before I
[1:45:44] was finally invited to come back and
[1:45:46] live with my
[1:45:48] family as me and her start getting back
[1:45:52] together
[1:45:53] our lifestyle has not
[1:45:56] changed again I'm just being
[1:45:59] transparent we were still going to the
[1:46:02] bars we were still wearing clothes we
[1:46:04] had no business wearing we were doing
[1:46:06] things we had no business
[1:46:08] doing this was our
[1:46:10] lifestyle and we just kept living that
[1:46:15] lifestyle but he had to another plan for
[1:46:20] us so what started happening mix
[1:46:24] was our daughters started heading down a
[1:46:29] path and as they started heading down
[1:46:32] this
[1:46:36] path we knew we had to do something for
[1:46:40] them
[1:46:45] and we knew the we had to get them away
[1:46:49] from school friends and get them church
[1:46:50] friends we had to get them some
[1:46:52] different friends
[1:46:53] so brother Trevor Eman I don't know if
[1:46:55] any of you know him but uh he had uh he
[1:46:59] had been one of the very few that had
[1:47:01] kept in contact with me and he kept
[1:47:04] telling me you've got you know just just
[1:47:06] come to this church of brother Nathan
[1:47:08] Bryant's church and my problem was there
[1:47:11] was I had known brother Nathan Bryant
[1:47:12] since he was about two years old and I
[1:47:15] could couldn't get those thoughts out of
[1:47:17] my head and I'm like there's no way I'm
[1:47:18] going to that church but eventually it
[1:47:21] was like okay we've got to find our Our
[1:47:23] Girls we've got to find them some
[1:47:24] friends some church friends see the idea
[1:47:27] was is to get them in church and once we
[1:47:30] did that then we could go live our own
[1:47:32] lifestyle and and they could have some
[1:47:34] church friends
[1:47:38] so we
[1:47:40] start to go to that
[1:47:43] church and I remember as I come into
[1:47:48] church again I am a message believer and
[1:47:52] I remember sitting there Sunday morning
[1:47:55] just doing everything I can to pick
[1:47:57] brother Nathan
[1:47:59] apart I'm not praying at this
[1:48:02] moment I have no relationship with
[1:48:05] Christ
[1:48:07] whatsoever
[1:48:09] see when you get to that those moments
[1:48:12] of where you've you you've told God I
[1:48:14] don't need you I'm I'm just G to do this
[1:48:17] myself and then you start moving away
[1:48:19] from fellowship from friends from
[1:48:21] brothers sisters
[1:48:23] Satan gets you
[1:48:24] isolated it's is that's exactly where
[1:48:27] he's wanting you at is isolated I've got
[1:48:31] a friend that's in the military he says
[1:48:32] the first thing the enemy does when they
[1:48:34] attack you is they try to isolate you
[1:48:38] they try to cut off all
[1:48:41] communication which is exactly what
[1:48:43] Satan had done there was no
[1:48:45] communication between me and
[1:48:47] God when there's no communication you
[1:48:50] can't call for help you can't call call
[1:48:53] for backup you can't call for supplies
[1:48:55] you can't call for anything you're
[1:48:57] isolated and that's where we were at
[1:48:59] it's exactly where Satan had us was
[1:49:01] right
[1:49:02] there we started going to that
[1:49:05] church and I remember it was the third
[1:49:08] or
[1:49:09] fourth the third or fourth service that
[1:49:13] we were
[1:49:15] in the end of service they start playing
[1:49:19] the
[1:49:20] song pass me not oh gentle
[1:49:23] savior brother I lost
[1:49:26] it I start
[1:49:28] crying I have no idea what in the world
[1:49:31] is wrong with me we're bringing our
[1:49:34] girls so that we can go do our own
[1:49:37] thing the next
[1:49:39] Sunday they start playing The Anchor
[1:49:43] Holds and I lose it
[1:49:46] again
[1:49:49] and I didn't understand what was going
[1:49:52] on with me but it was him dealing with
[1:49:55] me he started he started pulling me
[1:50:01] in and it
[1:50:03] was I think it was a couple months after
[1:50:06] we started going to church and he's
[1:50:08] starting to deal with
[1:50:10] me they uh tell us that this Camp is
[1:50:14] coming up byc I don't know if any of you
[1:50:17] young people have been there but we
[1:50:19] think this is great for our kids we'll
[1:50:22] make them go to this
[1:50:24] Camp so we take them we drop them
[1:50:28] off there was the second night that they
[1:50:33] called us second night we get a phone
[1:50:35] call she gets a phone call she puts it
[1:50:38] on speaker because our girls are irate
[1:50:43] they are not asking us they are
[1:50:45] demanding that we come and get them
[1:50:48] right now because this Camp is not up to
[1:50:51] their standards
[1:50:53] it's dirty there's
[1:50:56] flies this is not going to work for a
[1:50:59] week and I tell them you're there until
[1:51:03] Friday deal with it we'll see you on
[1:51:07] Friday now little did I know that the
[1:51:10] very next
[1:51:13] night they would meet him
[1:51:19] [Applause]
[1:51:24] they came in contact with Christ there
[1:51:27] at that
[1:51:29] camp so now we start going to
[1:51:33] church we start making some progression
[1:51:37] making some
[1:51:40] Headway I start praying
[1:51:46] again I start talking to the
[1:51:49] Lord about how I've got a family here
[1:51:55] and I can't just walk into this family
[1:51:57] and say hey we're going to start
[1:51:59] changing this and we're going to start
[1:52:00] doing this the clothes that they were
[1:52:02] wearing were the clothes that I bought
[1:52:04] them the makeup they were putting on was
[1:52:06] the makeup that I bought them the
[1:52:09] lifestyle that I was still living I was
[1:52:11] still wearing shorts I was still playing
[1:52:13] golf on Sunday afternoon instead of
[1:52:16] going to church I was still doing all of
[1:52:18] that but we just started making those
[1:52:20] little
[1:52:21] steps so I start praying to the
[1:52:24] Lord I know he's dealing with me I know
[1:52:27] I'm starting to change but they've got
[1:52:28] to change too but I can't just walk in
[1:52:32] there and say we're GNA do this so Lord
[1:52:35] I need you to step in I need you to do
[1:52:38] the impossible here you gave them to me
[1:52:41] and I didn't do my job I'm going to need
[1:52:43] you to do it for
[1:52:46] me so I watch as my family starts to
[1:52:51] change
[1:52:53] I watch as their
[1:52:57] progression they continue to
[1:53:01] move he does the
[1:53:03] impossible that's what he
[1:53:07] does a quote 1955 faith in action over
[1:53:11] and over again does the blind see the
[1:53:13] deaf hear over every night The
[1:53:15] Impossible scientifically impossible for
[1:53:18] a human being to do what the Holy Spirit
[1:53:20] does here every night right before for
[1:53:22] your face amen absolutely impossible but
[1:53:26] Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God
[1:53:29] does it
[1:53:31] anyhow six months in after I'm watching
[1:53:35] my family start to progress I'm starting
[1:53:37] to progress I rededicate my life to the
[1:53:39] Lord wasn't good enough for me just to
[1:53:42] go to church on Sunday morning and go
[1:53:43] play golf now now all a sudden
[1:53:45] something's happening to me and I'm
[1:53:47] getting serious six months in I
[1:53:49] rededicate my life and I I received the
[1:53:53] Holy
[1:53:53] Ghost I received the Holy Ghost at some
[1:53:56] meetings that we were
[1:54:00] having there was a prayer line going on
[1:54:04] I wasn't in the prayer line I didn't go
[1:54:06] in the prayer line I was sitting at my
[1:54:08] Pew praying for the people that were
[1:54:10] going through the prayer line but
[1:54:12] something happened in that moment I
[1:54:14] can't even sit here and say I physically
[1:54:16] felt anything a tear ran down my cheek
[1:54:19] there was no emotion like in 97 a tear
[1:54:23] ran down my cheek but I knew something
[1:54:24] had happened well you ask well how did
[1:54:27] you know that you received the Holy
[1:54:28] Ghost well because from that time I
[1:54:32] changed I could months down the road two
[1:54:35] months three months four months down
[1:54:38] something was different about me the way
[1:54:40] that I would address her the way that I
[1:54:43] would address my kids the way I would
[1:54:45] handle things was different I started
[1:54:48] talking different I started thinking
[1:54:50] different I started worshiping
[1:55:02] different I had someone ask me not too
[1:55:05] long
[1:55:07] ago how did I
[1:55:15] know brother Bram talks about something
[1:55:17] here and I want to express this to you
[1:55:22] because I had always wondered about what
[1:55:24] happened to me in that house when I was
[1:55:26] on my knees laying a floor what happened
[1:55:29] right there I couldn't couldn't
[1:55:31] understand that I knew there was no way
[1:55:33] that I received the Holy Ghost I hadn't
[1:55:35] repented of anything that would not be
[1:55:38] fair for him to treat me that way and
[1:55:39] everybody else a different way and I'm
[1:55:41] certainly not John the Baptist so that
[1:55:44] wouldn't have been fair so what happened
[1:55:46] in that
[1:55:48] house and then this scripture I came
[1:55:50] across this script scripture Ezekiel
[1:55:53] 3626 and 27 a new heart also will I give
[1:55:57] you and a new spirit will I put within
[1:56:00] you and I will take away the Stony heart
[1:56:03] out of your flesh and I will give you an
[1:56:05] heart of
[1:56:07] Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[1:56:10] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:56:14] and ye shall keep my judgments and do
[1:56:16] them there's two different things being
[1:56:18] talked about right here brother Bram
[1:56:21] says in 56 hidden life with Christ now
[1:56:24] the Bible said that he would give us a
[1:56:26] new heart and he would give us a new
[1:56:29] spirit and many people even Pentecostal
[1:56:32] people and Full Gospel people has been
[1:56:35] deceived in that many times God said
[1:56:39] I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't
[1:56:42] his Spirit that's your spirit then I
[1:56:45] will put my spirit in you I'll give you
[1:56:48] a new spirit then I will put my spirit
[1:56:50] in you and many times you get the new
[1:56:53] spirit and think you've got the Holy
[1:56:55] Spirit and trusting upon emotions and
[1:56:59] signs and things when your life doesn't
[1:57:02] PIV up to
[1:57:04] that your life doesn't pvy up to that
[1:57:07] people will stop at that moment right
[1:57:09] there thinking that they've got the Holy
[1:57:11] Spirit they don't have
[1:57:14] it Sunday morning is still good enough
[1:57:17] for
[1:57:19] them vacation cloth is still still okay
[1:57:22] with them taking that drink from time to
[1:57:26] time is still okay with them because
[1:57:30] that New Birth has not happened that
[1:57:33] change has not
[1:57:35] happened 1956 making the valley full of
[1:57:38] ditches show me your company I'll tell
[1:57:41] you who you are let me walk into your
[1:57:44] house let me see what's laying open on
[1:57:47] the table let me see how the Bible's
[1:57:49] marked up let me see where it's old Tru
[1:57:52] stories let me listen to what kind of
[1:57:54] music you're bringing on your radio let
[1:57:57] me see what kind of pictures you got in
[1:57:59] your house I'll tell you what you're
[1:58:01] made out of yes sir that's what your
[1:58:04] soul is feeding on regardless of what
[1:58:07] your testimony is your fruits prove what
[1:58:11] you
[1:58:16] are your
[1:58:18] fruits that's what we're looking for is
[1:58:21] a progress aggression not a feeling he
[1:58:24] never said did you feel it he said you
[1:58:26] believe it not a feeling not an emotion
[1:58:30] we're looking for fruits we're looking
[1:58:33] for one two three six months a year from
[1:58:35] now how's your life
[1:58:38] look don't stop at that moment where you
[1:58:41] feel
[1:58:44] something keep going until you see it
[1:58:48] until you can show someone what he's
[1:58:50] done for you
[1:58:57] so as we continue to go to church I'm
[1:59:00] doing a lot better my wife and kids are
[1:59:04] still struggling with
[1:59:06] things and I know that they
[1:59:09] are so I start praying to him
[1:59:12] again Lord I need you to I need you to
[1:59:15] help me here I can't do it I can guide
[1:59:19] them but I'm not going to come in here
[1:59:21] with an iron Rock and start
[1:59:23] swinging I'm doing the best I can I need
[1:59:26] your help
[1:59:28] though and then I start
[1:59:31] watching
[1:59:36] again if I would have walked in there
[1:59:40] and I would have went after them it
[1:59:43] wouldn't
[1:59:45] stick if the pastor says you need to do
[1:59:48] this and this and that's the reason you
[1:59:50] do it it won't won
[1:59:52] stick if brother brandham says you need
[1:59:56] to do this this and this and you're only
[1:59:58] doing it because brother brandom said do
[2:00:01] it it won't stick you've got to have a
[2:00:05] relationship with
[2:00:10] Christ he's the only one that can change
[2:00:13] someone from the inside out everybody
[2:00:17] wants to change the outward appearance
[2:00:19] but let him get a hold of you he changes
[2:00:23] what's inside here the outside will
[2:00:28] follow give somebody a chance to get him
[2:00:32] inside give him a
[2:00:35] [Applause]
[2:00:39] chance that vessel Of Dishonor very well
[2:00:42] might be a vessel of Honor that vessel
[2:00:46] of Wrath very well might be a vessel of
[2:00:50] Mercy
[2:00:58] so I stood back and I watched
[2:01:02] again I watched him start changing my
[2:01:06] family I can still
[2:01:09] remember my youngest daughter
[2:01:15] asking asking
[2:01:17] me to come take the fingernail polish r
[2:01:21] rack off of her wall that I hung there
[2:01:25] for
[2:01:26] her she took it down and she threw it in
[2:01:29] the
[2:01:30] trash I still remember the last time my
[2:01:34] oldest daughter wore a pair of
[2:01:37] shorts I can still remember the last
[2:01:40] time my wife went out for drinks with
[2:01:43] her
[2:01:44] friends but when she got
[2:01:48] there she couldn't take a drink
[2:01:52] [Applause]
[2:01:56] it wasn't
[2:01:57] me it wasn't
[2:02:00] me they found
[2:02:02] him and he started changing them and he
[2:02:06] started working from the
[2:02:09] inside
[2:02:12] out as we continue going to
[2:02:15] church and we continue to grow and we
[2:02:19] see these changes my wife gets concerned
[2:02:22] because she's saying why are you moving
[2:02:26] so much quicker than us spiritually why
[2:02:29] are you moving so much
[2:02:31] faster I didn't have an answer I didn't
[2:02:33] know
[2:02:34] why but it was a little while after she
[2:02:37] said that I heard somebody give these
[2:02:40] statistics Brothers if you hear anything
[2:02:44] I say this morning listen to this part
[2:02:47] right here there's any young Brothers in
[2:02:50] here that have just gotten married or
[2:02:51] thinking about getting married listen to
[2:02:54] this part right
[2:02:56] here
[2:02:58] statistics if you've got a family that's
[2:03:01] not going to church and the child of
[2:03:04] that family starts going to church
[2:03:07] there's a three and a half per chance
[2:03:10] that family will follow
[2:03:12] them if you've got the wife mother of a
[2:03:16] family that's not going to church and
[2:03:19] she starts going to church there's a
[2:03:22] 177% chance that that family will
[2:03:26] follow but if you take the father of a
[2:03:30] family that's not going to church and he
[2:03:34] starts going to church there's a
[2:03:38] 93% chance that that family will follow
[2:03:43] that is headship that is his design
[2:03:46] that's not a message statistic that's
[2:03:49] worldwide statistics
[2:03:52] that is a staggering number it's because
[2:03:54] it's headship and no matter how much the
[2:03:57] world is trying to break it down is
[2:03:59] trying to destroy that headship is
[2:04:01] trying to keep our young men's in Mom's
[2:04:04] basement playing video games I don't
[2:04:06] care how much they're trying to do it
[2:04:08] they cannot destroy that because it's
[2:04:11] his
[2:04:13] plan that's
[2:04:15] headship so young men middle-aged men
[2:04:20] husbands
[2:04:22] if you decide that you're going to stay
[2:04:23] home on Sunday morning to watch a
[2:04:28] game there's a 93% chance that family is
[2:04:31] going to follow you if you decide not to
[2:04:34] do devotions in your house there's a 93%
[2:04:38] chance that your family is going to do
[2:04:39] the same thing but if you decide to get
[2:04:43] up and go to church on Sunday morning to
[2:04:47] go to church on Sunday night if you have
[2:04:49] service to go to special meetings to to
[2:04:51] lead them in devotions there's a 93%
[2:04:54] chance they're going to follow
[2:05:03] you he was leading me I was leading
[2:05:12] them what changed us we met Jesus
[2:05:19] Christ I can still
[2:05:22] stand in
[2:05:24] church watching my kids with their hands
[2:05:26] in the air and I'll tear up every time I
[2:05:31] know right now they're in
[2:05:34] church why I'm not there because they're
[2:05:37] not doing it for me they're not doing it
[2:05:39] for the pastor because they met Jesus
[2:05:46] [Applause]
[2:05:49] Christ so as we start to keep
[2:05:52] progressing in our walk a couple years
[2:05:55] in I start feeling a call on my
[2:05:59] life and I'm thinking there is no way
[2:06:02] you have got to be kidding
[2:06:04] me there ain't nobody listen to one
[2:06:07] thing I say every every one of them know
[2:06:10] who I am they know where I came from
[2:06:12] nobody's going to listen to me Lord
[2:06:15] there ain't no way you got the wrong
[2:06:17] person I can also tell you he will not
[2:06:20] send you into battle
[2:06:22] unequipped he will equip you for
[2:06:25] whatever battle he is placing you
[2:06:27] in my biggest problem though was going
[2:06:31] to be telling my wife this that I'm
[2:06:33] feeling
[2:06:35] called she was raised tape
[2:06:40] only she had always thought that the
[2:06:43] church we were going to was just going
[2:06:45] to be a stepping stone and that we would
[2:06:48] eventually go back to tape
[2:06:50] only and I have to go tell her that I
[2:06:54] want to be a preacher let me rephrase
[2:06:56] that I did not want to be a preacher
[2:06:58] that I was feeling called to be a
[2:07:01] preacher I hit my knees again
[2:07:04] brother because I'm thinking
[2:07:07] Lord there's no way in the world that I
[2:07:10] can tell her this you're going to have
[2:07:12] to do something with
[2:07:14] her nine
[2:07:16] months my friend Trevor Eman
[2:07:19] knew and my pastor Nathan Bryant were
[2:07:22] the only two people that knew and I held
[2:07:24] that for nine months because I couldn't
[2:07:27] figure out the right time to tell her
[2:07:30] and when I finally broke down and I told
[2:07:32] her it was worse than what I thought it
[2:07:35] was going to
[2:07:37] be now I couldn't start ministering and
[2:07:40] I had this burning desire to start
[2:07:44] ministering and I couldn't do it because
[2:07:46] I just kept remembering if a God if God
[2:07:49] calls a man he'll call his wife
[2:07:52] I couldn't get past that one so I waited
[2:07:55] and I waited and I started slowly seeing
[2:07:59] her start to
[2:08:02] change and the opportunity
[2:08:05] came for me to go to
[2:08:07] Africa with brother
[2:08:10] Trevor I was going to be going to
[2:08:12] minister for the first time of my life
[2:08:14] in
[2:08:16] Africa she had progressed enough to
[2:08:20] where she said she was getting to the
[2:08:23] point where she was dealing with it and
[2:08:26] becoming okay with it I got to
[2:08:30] Africa the first place we stopped I
[2:08:32] unload my
[2:08:34] luggage and this fell out of my
[2:08:39] luggage it says hi just wanted to leave
[2:08:42] you a little note to say how proud of
[2:08:45] you that I
[2:08:48] am and how thankful of the husband and
[2:08:51] and
[2:08:52] father that you've become that God has
[2:08:55] made
[2:08:58] you I look forward to hearing all the
[2:09:01] stories and testimonies when you get
[2:09:04] back love
[2:09:10] Sarah he does the
[2:09:13] impossible that's what he does he does
[2:09:15] the
[2:09:19] impossible he makes the impossible
[2:09:21] possible possible when you're in that
[2:09:24] situation and you're
[2:09:26] thinking I don't see how to get out of
[2:09:29] this I can't even find the door to
[2:09:33] open give him just a minute he'll create
[2:09:37] the door and then he'll open
[2:09:39] it he does the
[2:09:44] impossible he took me and he had to
[2:09:47] thoroughly break down that vessel
[2:09:50] because he had to rebuild it the way he
[2:09:53] wanted
[2:09:56] it there's a brother by the name of
[2:09:58] Daniel Evans you guys may know him he's
[2:10:01] a pastor out in
[2:10:04] Tucson me and brother Daniel had known
[2:10:07] each other for a long time but we'd
[2:10:10] never really spoke we'd probably known
[2:10:11] each other for 20 years but we had never
[2:10:14] really
[2:10:15] spoke I was not very approachable
[2:10:22] I had been chiseling away at this
[2:10:26] thought of me being a a preacher with my
[2:10:29] wife for some time and it gotten her to
[2:10:31] the point where she was
[2:10:34] okay brother Dan Evans preached a sermon
[2:10:37] and he said something and brother Dan
[2:10:39] Evans and my wife come from a very
[2:10:41] similar background and I'd been
[2:10:43] chiseling away at this for a couple of
[2:10:45] years and all of a sudden he comes along
[2:10:47] and it's like he took a
[2:10:49] sledgehammer and just knocked this ball
[2:10:51] P her out so I just reached out to him
[2:10:54] because I wanted to let him know what he
[2:10:56] had done for our family in that
[2:11:00] setting I sent him a text like I said 20
[2:11:04] years me and him made maybe had spoke
[2:11:06] five words to each
[2:11:09] other told him what had happened and
[2:11:11] everything we decided we were going to
[2:11:12] meet for breakfast so a couple days
[2:11:15] later we meet I got there a little bit
[2:11:18] before
[2:11:20] him he walks in I walk over I shake his
[2:11:22] hand I give him a hug we go when we sit
[2:11:25] down at the table he looks across at me
[2:11:27] and he goes something's different about
[2:11:31] you I didn't know what he was talking
[2:11:33] about I was like I got you know what
[2:11:34] gray hair my glasses I what is it you
[2:11:37] know he said no he said your entire
[2:11:40] demeanor is
[2:11:42] different what was
[2:11:44] that that's the power of Jesus
[2:11:48] Christ a man that I talk to maybe two or
[2:11:52] three times in my life looks across and
[2:11:54] could tell that something was different
[2:11:56] about
[2:11:57] me
[2:11:59] why because there was
[2:12:01] love coming through he could tell he
[2:12:05] could see there was something different
[2:12:06] Daddy had met Jesus is what the
[2:12:09] difference was I can still remember when
[2:12:13] he took me by the arm and he started
[2:12:16] walking with
[2:12:18] me I can remember him walking me back to
[2:12:20] my family brother Thomas I remember him
[2:12:23] walking me all the way to Africa to give
[2:12:26] this same testimony I'm giving right
[2:12:29] now he's walked me to 10 or 12 other
[2:12:32] churches to give this same testimony I'm
[2:12:34] giving right
[2:12:35] now what is
[2:12:39] that that's Jesus
[2:12:42] Christ that's Jesus Christ the same
[2:12:45] yesterday today and
[2:12:47] forever he changed my
[2:12:50] life what did he do for me he gave me
[2:12:54] power he put love in my heart he gave me
[2:12:58] a sound
[2:13:01] mind there was something placed in me
[2:13:03] before the foundation of this world
[2:13:06] there wasn't a demon in hell that could
[2:13:09] stop what was going to happen it didn't
[2:13:11] matter what I had done in the past there
[2:13:14] was nothing could stop that
[2:13:17] moment people constantly talk about what
[2:13:19] God has done done in the Bible what he's
[2:13:22] done in the past what God is is doing
[2:13:25] he's going to do in the future he's
[2:13:26] coming back for us they talk about the
[2:13:28] past but what about right now he's not
[2:13:31] just the god of the Bible he's not just
[2:13:35] the god of our future he's the god of
[2:13:37] today Legion is standing in front of you
[2:13:41] right now he is the god of today he's
[2:13:44] the god of right now what you have need
[2:13:47] of he changed my life he's not a
[2:13:50] respector of person
[2:13:51] what he did for me he can do the same
[2:13:54] thing for
[2:13:58] you we moved into a house just a couple
[2:14:00] years
[2:14:03] ago there's a lot of trees on this
[2:14:06] property I'm closing there's a lot of
[2:14:09] trees on this
[2:14:10] property was one of the reasons why we
[2:14:13] bought this property three and a half
[2:14:14] acres a lot of the trees really pretty
[2:14:18] after we moved on to this property we
[2:14:19] noticed that when a storm would come
[2:14:22] these trees and I'm talking trees that
[2:14:24] you can't get your arms around I mean
[2:14:27] two of us couldn't get our arms around
[2:14:28] these trees these trees would fall
[2:14:31] over and they' be Hollow on the inside I
[2:14:35] was like what in the world is going on
[2:14:37] so I Googled it that's what we all do
[2:14:40] Google right I Googled it and it said
[2:14:44] that a
[2:14:46] tree can be
[2:14:48] dead and not know it
[2:14:52] these trees would were standing there
[2:14:54] big trees they would have leaves on them
[2:14:58] these
[2:15:00] trees that are dead can still produce
[2:15:04] leaves they cannot produce
[2:15:08] fruit they can stand there for a
[2:15:11] while but when a storm comes it'll knock
[2:15:15] them
[2:15:17] down I started thinking about that and
[2:15:19] then I heard a brother at our church get
[2:15:22] up and pray one time and he started
[2:15:24] talking about a fruit tree that he had
[2:15:27] pretty good sized tree that was in his
[2:15:30] front yard a storm came it knocked the
[2:15:34] tree over roots and everything came up
[2:15:36] out of the
[2:15:38] ground he had a buddy of his that had a
[2:15:40] crane he didn't know if it would work or
[2:15:42] not but he brought the crane over they
[2:15:45] lifted the tree back
[2:15:47] up they put the ports on that tree

[2:27:02] the blood of Jesus Christ is what saves
[2:27:05] us amen this is an outward showing of
[2:27:07] something that happens on the inside
[2:27:10] amen a sign of repentance amen and being
[2:27:14] immersed in water amen showing that you
[2:27:16] are dying to yourself and being buried
[2:27:20] ain't that right amen and so when Peter
[2:27:23] was given to prescription as the prophet
[2:27:25] of God Called It the prescription Amen
[2:27:28] in Acts 2 and verse 20 37 it says now

[2:27:36] to the rest of the Apostles men and
[2:27:38] Brethren what shall we do in amen how

[2:27:57] pricking their heart Amen to follow the
[2:28:00] Lord with all of their heart what a
[2:28:02] glorious thing at a young age I was 20
[2:28:04] years old I don't know how old you I was

[2:28:27] amen and say God I need your help
[2:28:29] because it takes God Amen what shall we
[2:28:32] do and then Peter saith unto them repent
[2:28:34] and be baptized every one of you in the
[2:28:36] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:28:38] of your sins and you shall receive the
[2:28:41] holy spirit for the promise is to you to
[2:28:44] your children to them that are far off
[2:28:46] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:28:49] call amen

[2:28:55] verse 11 it says this is the stone which
[2:28:58] was set at not of you Builders which has
[2:29:00] become the head of the corner and
[2:29:03] neither is there salvation in any other
[2:29:06] for there is none other name under
[2:29:09] Heaven given whereby men must be saved
