[23:42] time, she asked me, she said, "Brother
[23:43] David, did you put your name in there or
[23:46] is that really the way it goes?" I said,

[23:53] anyways, we're just glad to be in the

[26:18] Amen. How many's thankful for the

[26:23] old old story how my savior came from
[26:28] glory. How he gave his life on Calvary
[26:34] to save a [singing] wretch [music] like
[26:36] me. And I heard about his groaning of
[26:42] his precious blood atoning.
[26:46] Then I repeated [music]
[26:48] of my sins and won the victory.
[26:54] Oh victory in Jesus my savior

[27:26] about his [singing and music] healing of
[27:30] his cleansing power revealing
[27:33] how he made the lame [singing] to walk
[27:36] again. [music] And he caused the blind
[27:39] to [singing] see.
[27:42] Then I cried, "Dear Jesus, [music]
[27:45] come and heal my broken [singing] spirit

[28:11] blood. Oh, he loved me. I knew him

[28:16] and all my love.
[28:20] He plunged me to victory
[28:24] beneath [singing and music] the
[28:26] cleansing flood. And I heard about a
[28:30] mansion he has built for me in glory.
[28:36] And I heard about [music]
[28:38] the streets [singing] of gold beyond the
[28:41] crystal sea. [music]
[28:44] about [singing] the angels sing
[28:47] and the old [music] red
[28:50] story and song. I'm going to sing
[28:54] [music and singing] up there that song
[28:56] of victory.
[28:59] Oh, victory
[29:01] in Jesus my savior
[29:05] forever.

[29:23] [music and singing] me to victory
[29:26] beneath the once again if we could. Oh,

[29:50] my love is [singing] due him. He plunged

[32:19] [singing]
[32:20] of the Lord.
[32:23] In whom the wisdom of the angels
[32:28] lies.
[32:30] For whom the [singing] raging [music]
[32:32] of the seas

[32:37] A living sacrifice,
[32:41] the [music and singing] only source of
[32:44] life. Oh yes, my hope [music]

[33:02] is in the Lord [singing]
[33:06] forever more.
[33:09] I love this.
[33:12] His tender mercies [music]
[33:15] come with ever rising sun
[33:20] to meet the sitter in his [singing]
[33:23] brokenness [music]
[33:27] to offer healing [singing] and
[33:29] forgiveness.
[33:34] [music] And those who trust in him will
[33:38] find their hearts at rest. Oh [singing]
[33:41] yes, my hope
[33:44] [music] it's in the Lord
[33:47] [singing]
[33:48] from this time on
[33:51] and ever more.
[33:54] Oh my hope [singing]
[33:58] is in [music] the Lord
[34:01] forever. Let's stand and sing that
[34:04] second verse as brother Chris comes.
[34:08] Tender [singing and music] mercies come
[34:11] with every rising sun
[34:15] to meet the sitter [singing] in his
[34:18] brokenness
[34:20] [music]
[34:22] to offer healing [singing]
[34:24] and forgiveness. [music]
[34:29] And those who trust [music] in him will
[34:33] find their [singing] hearts at rest. Oh
[34:36] yes, my hope
[34:38] [singing]
[34:39] [music] is in the Lord
[34:42] from this time on

[34:49] Oh my hope

[35:26] Sing it again. Oh,
[35:30] my
[35:31] hope
[35:34] is in the Lord
[35:37] for this [music and singing] time on
[35:40] for never more.
[35:45] My hope
[35:47] is in the Lord
[35:51] forever
[35:52] more.
[35:54] [music]
[35:56] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful tonight? God bless
[36:01] you. You may be seated. Just had a few
[36:03] songs on our heart tonight to sing. I
[36:06] hope it's a blessing
[36:08] as they come forward.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:49] &gt;&gt; When I [singing] think of how he came
[36:55] [music]
[36:56] so far from glory.
[37:01] He came to dwell among the lowly
[37:09] such as I
[37:14] to suffer shame and such disgrace.
[37:21] on Mount [singing] Calary took my place.
[37:27] Then I ask myself this question.
[37:32] Who am I?
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, who am I
[37:41] that a king [singing] would bleed and
[37:46] die for?
[37:49] [singing]
[37:51] Who am I that he would pray? [singing]
[37:57] Not my will but thine, Lord.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Not my will but thine, Lord.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; The answer I may never [singing]
[38:08] know.
[38:11] Why ever
[38:13] love me [music] so?
[38:17] [singing] to that old rugged cross he
[38:21] would go for who am I?
[38:29] When I'm reminded [singing] of his words
[38:35] I'll leave you never.
[38:40] If you'll be true, I'll give to you
[38:47] life forever
[38:50] and forever.
[38:53] I wonder what I could have done
[38:59] to deserve God's only son.
[39:05] We fight our battles until they're won.
[39:11] For who am I?
[39:16] Oh, who am I that a king would bleed and
[39:25] die for?
[39:27] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, who am I that he would pray?
[39:35] Not my will but thine, Lord.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Not my will but thine, Lord. [singing]
[39:41] &gt;&gt; The answer I may never know.
[39:48] Just why he ever
[39:51] loved me.
[39:55] to [music] an old [singing]
[39:56] rugged cross he would go for who am I?
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, and to an [music] old [singing]
[40:09] rugged cross he would go for who am I?
[40:20] Hey,
[40:23] [applause]
[40:36] God bless you all. Pray for me as I sing
[40:38] this. It's been a really long time and I
[40:40] hope I can make it through it.
[40:42] [clears throat]
[41:01] The [singing] room grew still as she
[41:05] made her way to Jesus. She stumbled
[41:08] through the tears that made her blind.
[41:13] [singing]
[41:16] She felt such pain.
[41:19] [music] Some just spoke in anger. Heard
[41:23] folks whisper, "There's no place here
[41:26] for
[41:28] her kind."
[41:31] But still on she came through the shame
[41:35] that flushed her face until [music] at
[41:38] last [singing]
[41:39] she knelt before his feet.
[41:45] And though she spoke no [singing] words,
[41:48] everything she said was heard as she
[41:53] poured her love for the master from her
[41:57] box of alabaster.
[42:03] I've come [singing] to
[42:06] pour my praise on him like oil
[42:13] from Mary's alabaster box.
[42:20] Don't be angry if I wash his feet with
[42:25] my tears and I dry them with my hair.
[42:30] [singing]
[42:35] You who weren't there
[42:38] the night Jesus found me. [singing]
[42:42] You did not feel what I felt when he
[42:46] wrapped his loving arms around me. And
[42:50] you don't know the cost of [music] the
[42:54] oil in my alabaster
[42:59] box.
[43:05] I can't forget the way
[43:09] life used to be. I was a prisoner to the
[43:14] sin that held me bound. [singing]
[43:19] [music] I spent my days poured my
[43:23] [singing] life without [music] measure
[43:26] into a little treasure box I thought I'd
[43:31] found. [singing]
[43:35] until the day when [singing] Jesus came
[43:39] to me. He healed my soul with the wonder
[43:44] of his touch.
[43:48] So now I'm giving back to him. All the
[43:52] praise he's worthy of. I've been
[43:55] forgiven.
[43:57] That's [music] why I love [singing] him
[44:00] so much. [screaming]
[44:06] I've come to pour my praise on him like
[44:12] oil
[44:15] from Mary's alabaster box.
[44:19] [music]
[44:23] Don't be angry if I wash his feet with
[44:27] [music] my tears and I dry them with my
[44:32] hair.
[44:37] You [singing and music] weren't there
[44:40] the night Jesus found me.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[44:44] &gt;&gt; You did not feel what I felt when he
[44:48] [music] wrapped his loving arms around
[44:51] me. And you don't know
[44:54] [singing and music] the cost of the oil
[44:57] in my alabaster
[45:00] box.
[45:03] Sing it with me. I've come to pour my
[45:09] praise on him like oil [singing]
[45:15] alabaster box.
[45:21] So don't be angry if I wash his feet
[45:25] with my [singing] tears and I dry them
[45:30] with my hair.
[45:36] You [singing] weren't there
[45:39] the night Jesus found me. And you did
[45:43] not feel what I felt when he wrapped his
[45:47] loving arms around me.
[45:51] And you don't know the cost of the oil
[45:56] in my alabaster
[45:59] bone.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Praise [snorts] the Lord.
[46:16] Tell you, every time you think about
[46:17] [music] what he's done for you, where
[46:19] he's took you from in this world
[46:22] and gave you salvation,
[46:26] I'm so thankful today.
[46:29] Just thought we would sing [music] this
[46:30] song.
[46:38] [music]
[46:49] &gt;&gt; It's so easy
[46:51] to criticize [singing]
[46:54] when [music] someone else fails.
[46:59] It's so easy to [singing] see faults in
[47:03] them when we overlook ourselves.
[47:09] [music] Lord knows I'm not perfect.
[47:12] I [singing] don't deserve to throw rocks
[47:16] at anyone.
[47:19] So [singing and music] when there's a
[47:21] mistake,
[47:25] let [singing] it be this [music] one.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; If I'm guilty, [singing and music]
[47:33] let me be guilty of too much mercy.
[47:39] [music and singing]
[47:40] If I'm going to be wrong,
[47:44] let me [music and singing] be wrong for
[47:46] treating someone else right.
[47:50] [music]
[47:51] &gt;&gt; I don't want to purse down. All I want
[47:55] to do now is help [music] my brother
[47:58] [singing] back
[48:00] on his feet.
[48:02] If I'm guilty, [music and singing]
[48:05] let me be guilty of too much mercy.
[48:10] [singing]
[48:13] &gt;&gt; So many moments [music]
[48:15] I'm busy [singing] taking when I should
[48:19] be g. [music]
[48:23] So [singing] many moments
[48:26] I'm busy [music] talking when I should
[48:29] be giving.
[48:33] Yeah, [music] I need to make it more
[48:36] about others. Time after time [singing]
[48:42] I have found [music]
[48:44] the simple truth.
[48:46] Whatever you give is going to come back
[48:51] around.
[48:54] If I'm guilty, [music]
[48:57] let me be guilty of too much [music]
[49:01] mercy.
[49:04] If I'm going to be [singing] wrong,
[49:07] [music] let me be wrong for treating
[49:10] [singing] someone else right.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm first down. All I want to do
[49:19] now [singing] is help my brother back
[49:23] [music]
[49:23] on his feet.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; If I'm guilty, [music] let me be guilty
[49:31] of too much mercy.
[49:34] [music]
[49:36] If I'm guilty,
[49:39] let me be guilty of too much mercy.
[49:44] [singing]
[49:46] [music]
[49:46] If I'm going to be wrong,
[49:49] let me be wrong for treating someone
[49:53] [singing and music]
[49:53] else right.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Push [music and singing] down. All
[50:00] I want to do now is help my brother back
[50:06] on his [music and singing] feet.
[50:08] If I'm guilty,
[50:11] let me be guilty of too much [music]
[50:15] mercy.
[50:16] [singing]
[50:18] [music]
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:20] [applause]
[50:22] Let me be guilty. Too much mercy. You
[50:25] know, he showed us mercy. He came by
[50:28] your way, shaped [music] in sin,
[50:30] speaking lies. Aren't you thankful
[50:32] tonight? We serve a great God. We have a
[50:36] great message. God has revealed the end
[50:38] of the hour and we should be the
[50:40] happiest people.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; You know, there's nothing in the cross
[50:44] that I see that's negative,
[50:47] but nothing but positive. If you ever
[50:48] look at the cross, do you see any
[50:50] negative in the cross? It's always
[50:51] [music] positive. [snorts] I thought
[50:53] about, you know, you do have to have
[50:54] negative trials and [music] hard things
[50:57] in life. But it takes the negative and
[50:59] the positive to crank your car up
[51:00] tonight.
[51:02] If you go crank it up tonight, if you
[51:03] take the negative off, it won't crank.
[51:07] So sometimes you need the negative to
[51:09] just filter out the junk in our life of
[51:12] the trials and tribulations and things
[51:14] we go through. But I'm thankful for it
[51:16] all. He's still worthy of our praise.
[51:20] May God bless you tonight. Let's [music]
[51:22] just turn to him tonight. Let's just
[51:24] pray. Father, we love you, God, as we
[51:27] turn the order of the service, [music]
[51:28] Lord.
[51:30] God, the most important part is the
[51:32] hearing of your word.
[51:34] [music] And God, we stand before your
[51:36] people today, God, and just ask you
[51:39] would speak, [music] Lord. God, you'd
[51:41] have your way tonight.
[51:44] God, we love you, Father. We serve such
[51:46] a great God. You're you've been God,
[51:48] you've always been there [music] for us.
[51:50] You never forsaken us. God, we might
[51:53] have forsaken you, but you've never
[51:54] forsaken us. God, we're thankful for
[51:57] this truth and thankful for this church.
[52:00] And brother Ber, may you bless them
[52:01] tonight, Lord. May you touch them.
[52:04] Father, may you touch your people. May
[52:05] you encourage us. May you stop by
[52:07] [music] and lift us up in heavenly
[52:08] places tonight in Jesus name. Amen. God
[52:12] bless you tonight. I just again want to
[52:15] speak your labor is not in vain. Excuse
[52:18] my voice, but we'll get through it.
[52:20] Labor is not in vain. I just maybe put
[52:22] that part two, but I just felt led to
[52:25] finish it out. I was going to go a
[52:27] different direction, but I just feel led
[52:29] just to bring this out again as we turn
[52:31] to 1 Corinthians 15:E 50. As we stand,
[52:35] it' be great. 1 Corinthians 15:50-58.
[52:40] Read this and I'll get into some more of
[52:43] this. 1 Corinthians 15:50-58.
[52:47] It says now it says this I say brethren
[52:51] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[52:54] kingdom of God nor doeth corruption
[52:56] inherit incorruption. Behold I show you
[52:59] a min a mystery. We shall not all sleep
[53:03] but we shall all be changed
[53:07] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye.
[53:09] Are you waiting for that day?
[53:11] at the last trump. For the shall sound,
[53:15] and the dead shall be raised
[53:17] incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
[53:21] For the incorruptible must put on
[53:23] incorruption, and this mortal must put
[53:26] on immortality. Aren't you thankful God
[53:28] took your place tonight? He He became
[53:31] sin that you may not become sin.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; He became cor He corruption where we
[53:39] could we could get salvation. Verse
[53:41] [snorts] 54. So when this corruptible
[53:44] shall put on incorruption, and this
[53:47] mortal shall have put on immortality,
[53:51] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[53:53] that is written, death is swallowed up
[53:55] in victory. Aren't you thankful there's
[53:58] no more death to a Christian? Verse 55,
[54:01] oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave,
[54:04] where is thy victory? The sting of death
[54:07] is sin, and the strength of sin is of
[54:09] the law. And as I spoke before, but
[54:12] thanks be to God which give us victory
[54:16] through our Lord Jesus Christ. Not
[54:19] through some other god tonight, not
[54:21] through some other Buddha tonight that
[54:24] over in India, they they serve all these
[54:26] gods. Hundreds and hundreds of gods, but
[54:30] but you've been enlightened to serve one
[54:32] Lord Jesus Christ.
[54:34] And he goes on to verse say verse 58.
[54:37] Therefore, my beloved brethren, it says,
[54:40] "Be yet steadfast,
[54:42] unmovable,
[54:44] always abounding in the work of the
[54:47] Lord.
[54:48] For so much as you know that your labor
[54:51] is not in vain in the Lord." May God has
[54:53] blessings. You may be seated. Aren't you
[54:56] thankful that your labor is not in vain?
[55:00] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of stuff we could do
[55:02] tonight. You can go home. You can go
[55:05] watch a ball game.
[55:07] Whatever it is, but you're here tonight
[55:09] and I'm here to tell you, your labor is
[55:11] not in vain. Just because I'm laboring
[55:14] up here, you're laboring. You're pulling
[55:15] on the word of God. And I just ask you
[55:18] tonight just to pull on the word as it
[55:20] comes forth and let you get your
[55:22] blessing.
[55:24] But it's not in vain what you're doing,
[55:26] what you're coming to church, bringing
[55:27] your kids day after day,
[55:31] service after service.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; And it might be that very service
[55:35] tonight that you walk out well.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; It might be the very service tonight you
[55:41] check your bank account and you got more
[55:42] money than you than you left with.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; There might be a job offer on Monday
[55:46] morning because you came today.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; You never know.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Yeah.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; But our God looks at your faithfulness.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Your God looks on the inside of the
[55:58] heart.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; And that's why I love what brother
[56:00] Brandwood would, and I'm paraphrasing
[56:01] tonight, but God would look at the
[56:03] inside of your heart tonight. And he
[56:05] doesn't look through our mind. Aren't
[56:06] you glad God doesn't look at your mind
[56:08] tonight like we look at other people and
[56:10] we go, "Well, we think he does this and
[56:12] we think they're this." But aren't you
[56:14] glad our God Aren't you glad we're not
[56:16] to judge everybody
[56:19] &gt;&gt; because we probably wouldn't. There
[56:20] wouldn't be many saved probably.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; But our God looks past the mind. He
[56:25] looks inside your heart.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Brother Chris, I'm
[56:29] I'm a million miles away." But hey,
[56:31] you're still go in progression tonight.
[56:34] We're all sons and daughters of a king.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean that you're not
[56:38] going to fall up and make mistakes. And
[56:40] there's nothing that my sons can do that
[56:42] they come to me and tell me, "Daddy, I
[56:44] messed up. I done this." And hey, hey,
[56:47] you know what? Make it right
[56:50] &gt;&gt; that I not put them up in my hold them
[56:52] and say, "No matter what age you are, I
[56:54] forgive you and Jesus Christ forgives
[56:56] you."
[56:58] &gt;&gt; And so, how much more does the father
[57:00] forgive us when we're falling short? And
[57:03] we're falling short in life. And there's
[57:05] things that young people, you're going
[57:07] to fall short in things.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; But it's the the thing you need to
[57:11] understand is you got to get back up.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; You got to keep pressing on. I fall
[57:16] every day. Every single day, I need I
[57:20] need to I need to look in the mirror and
[57:21] say, "Lord, but your mercies are new
[57:23] every morning."
[57:24] &gt;&gt; I like what David says because you
[57:27] realize you need them mercies every day.
[57:30] Not just not just on Sunday, but Monday
[57:32] through Friday through Saturday through
[57:35] Sunday, we need his mercies.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, if you say,
[57:39] "Brother Chris, I think I went too far."
[57:42] And maybe you felt like I've gone too
[57:44] far from the God. But guess what? If
[57:46] there's that deep cause, too deep to
[57:48] respond, there's some you be thankful
[57:51] tonight that there's something on the
[57:53] inside saying, "That's me, Lord. That's
[57:57] me. I come another service and maybe
[58:00] this service will be your breakthrough.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Maybe this service you'll leave without
[58:06] depression and anxiety or whatever you
[58:09] keep bringing in every single day.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; And too many times we we carry our stuff
[58:14] that he says my yoke is light.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Too many times we we carry our baggage
[58:22] and we we carry past sin. We carry past
[58:25] mistakes.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] when God wants, he's already carried it
[58:30] to the cross.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm just way off my notes,
[58:34] but here I am. But I but I but I'm here
[58:37] to TELL YOU THAT WE got to STOP CARRYING
[58:39] IT. IT'S NOT YOUR DUTY to carry it.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ carried it all [snorts]
[58:45] &gt;&gt; and it's not in vain. He went to the
[58:48] CROSS AND HIS BLOOD is still dripping
[58:50] for every one of you tonight.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Every single one of you BY NAME. HAS
[58:57] CALLED YOU OUT BY THE CROSS.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Make it personal tonight.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Make it personable in a way that when he
[59:04] looks when he was on the cross, you by
[59:08] name was on his mind.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't in vain. He got beaten. He
[59:14] didn't get beaten in vain. He He kept
[59:16] his mouth shut
[59:18] for me and you.
[59:21] He could have called 10 million legions
[59:23] of angels down from heaven to end it
[59:26] right away. But he knew he saw me and
[59:29] you today. HE SAW US COMING TO CHURCH
[59:33] AND AND THROUGH THIS LIFE AND GOING
[59:35] THROUGH HEARTACHES AND MAYBE LOSING MY
[59:38] HOUSE AND MAYBE LOSING MY CAR, BUT his
[59:41] increase is better.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; And maybe you've lost a loved one or
[59:45] maybe you lost a job. WHATEVER IT IS,
[59:48] BUT GOD is still worthy of our praise.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; And maybe you think like Job tonight,
[59:56] JOB LOST IT ALL, BOYS. HE WOULD GOT
[59:59] SICK. HE uh he tried Job.
[1:00:02] Who can I try? Who's worthy? And he
[1:00:04] looks at he says, "Try job. He won't
[1:00:06] curse me. He won't he he he he's a
[1:00:08] worthy man."
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; And maybe you come in this church and
[1:00:13] you're like, "Brother Chris, I'm tired.
[1:00:14] I'm weary. I've lived in the message
[1:00:16] long enough, but I'm here to tell you,
[1:00:19] don't live in the message. Let the
[1:00:21] message live in you.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Let the message be a part of your life.
[1:00:26] Let the word of God shine in your heart
[1:00:29] and live for him forever.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; But it says, "Be steadfast, unmovable,
[1:00:37] always abounding." I love that. And the
[1:00:40] work of the Lord,
[1:00:42] his work is not finished.
[1:00:44] Maybe you be the last hands and feet
[1:00:47] that's all he's got to get that last
[1:00:49] person in. Praise God.
[1:00:52] If I could tell you, I would give all
[1:00:54] the money I have, which ain't much. I
[1:00:56] give it all to you if you could find the
[1:00:58] last person because this is a pess house
[1:01:00] to me. Every single day you live in it,
[1:01:03] you're like, "How are we making it day
[1:01:05] by day? The government's corrupt.
[1:01:08] Everything's corrupt. The only thing we
[1:01:10] got is a solid foundation is the word of
[1:01:13] God.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; It has been opened before our day from
[1:01:18] Genesis to Revelation. And you have been
[1:01:20] given the sword.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Every one of you has been given the
[1:01:25] sword of the king.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; And you go, "Well, brother Brandham, it
[1:01:30] came down in Arizona and he got the
[1:01:32] sword of the king, but he got the sword
[1:01:34] of the king and he's handed it off to
[1:01:36] each and every one of us.
[1:01:38] He's gave YOU A SWORD TO FIGHT THE devil
[1:01:41] anywhere, anytime, any place,
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; and we take it for granted that it came
[1:01:49] to him and he passed it off to you
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; because he says this message must live.
[1:01:56] I'm talking about live individuals, not
[1:01:58] live on a book, not live on a bookshelf,
[1:02:01] not live on these iPads, but live on the
[1:02:04] inside
[1:02:06] and be something that you're walking
[1:02:08] written epistles read of all men.
[1:02:12] People are watching you. Your
[1:02:13] grandchildren are watching you. Maybe
[1:02:15] you say, "Brother Chris, I kind of lost
[1:02:17] one." Well, guess what? It's not in
[1:02:19] vain. You look at me like, "Well, that's
[1:02:22] crazy. It's not in vain." No, you can
[1:02:24] have your house. your whole house
[1:02:26] tonight. The devil will tell you, "Well,
[1:02:28] my house is." You can have your house,
[1:02:31] just apply it to them.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Just because YOUR FAITHFULNESS, YOUR
[1:02:36] ENTIRE home comes in.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; For the ones you love than the ones that
[1:02:41] loved you,
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; you talking about grace tonight. That's
[1:02:45] the grace of God. I don't care how far
[1:02:47] they look, how far they can sin. I tell
[1:02:50] you, my God's my God's blood that shaped
[1:02:52] iniquity. My blood, God's blood that
[1:02:54] shed on Calvary, I'm sorry, shed on
[1:02:56] Calvary is still dripping tonight for
[1:02:59] every one of lost souls.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's your family member tonight.
[1:03:04] Maybe you got a brother, a sister,
[1:03:06] whatever uh here in the world, but God's
[1:03:09] going to call them in one day.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; God's going to call every one of them in
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; just because of your stance in Jesus
[1:03:17] Christ. I like where 1 Corinthians 15
[1:03:20] and and and I read this earlier, but
[1:03:22] this other translation says, "So now,
[1:03:24] beloved ones, stand firm, stable,
[1:03:26] enduring. Live your lives with an
[1:03:29] unshakable confidence."
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; I think it would do good us tonight to
[1:03:35] have an unshakable
[1:03:37] confidence. You know, you might say,
[1:03:39] "Well, I probably don't want to boast,
[1:03:40] RIGHT?" NO, BUT JUST HAVE A CONFIDENCE.
[1:03:43] You know what your savior did for you.
[1:03:46] know that the blood is sufficient for
[1:03:49] all your needs. Whatever needs you got,
[1:03:53] it's sufficient.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Whatever sin you committed, whatever you
[1:03:57] did last night, whatever you did today,
[1:04:00] whatever you're going to do, that the
[1:04:02] cross is three-dimensional.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; It's for your past sin, your present
[1:04:07] sin, and your future sin.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, think about it tonight. It don't
[1:04:14] JUST COVER YOUR PAST. IT covers your
[1:04:16] present and it covers your future sin.
[1:04:21] That's how strong Jesus's blood is.
[1:04:23] [applause]
[1:04:25] That covers it all. Aren't you thankful
[1:04:27] tonight? As I read earlier, the
[1:04:30] definition of steadfast is firm, fixed,
[1:04:32] unwavering, dependable. That's hard to
[1:04:35] find today. Dependable.
[1:04:38] I have a little little little job and
[1:04:40] you barely get anybody to come in to
[1:04:42] work today. They want to call in about
[1:04:45] this. My tooth hurts or a lot my this
[1:04:47] way my my wheel fell off or it's always
[1:04:50] some excuse.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; I ran out of gas.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; My my mama's foot hurts. It don't
[1:04:56] matter.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; It's always an excuse. But I'm here to
[1:05:01] tell you, WHEN I SHOW UP TO the kingdom
[1:05:03] one day, when I show up to the gate,
[1:05:07] when I get to heaven, I This is how we
[1:05:09] should all be. When we should get up to
[1:05:12] heaven, THERE'S ONE PLACE YOU SHOULD
[1:05:14] SHOW UP EXHAUSTED.
[1:05:16] That's when you get to the end of the
[1:05:18] gate and you should just be going,
[1:05:19] "Brother Joe, oh, I barely MADE IT, BUT
[1:05:22] I MADE IT." [applause]
[1:05:24] That's when you SHOULD SHOW UP
[1:05:26] EXHAUSTED. YOU SHOULD SHOW UP EXHAUSTED
[1:05:29] RIGHT WHEN YOU get up to Jesus Christ.
[1:05:31] Say, "God, I just fall in your arms."
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; That's where you want to show up
[1:05:36] exhausted. And I tell you what, I might
[1:05:38] be exhausted tonight, but it's worth it
[1:05:41] all.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; It's worth it all for one more soul.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; One more saint to say, "God, I want to
[1:05:48] serve you more. I want to give my life.
[1:05:50] I want to pray more. I want to read my
[1:05:52] Bible more.
[1:05:54] but be fixed, unwavering, dependable,
[1:05:58] constantly faithful of what I have.
[1:06:01] And then I wrote down unmovable.
[1:06:04] Unmovable means to [snorts] be not to be
[1:06:07] pushed off course. Shaken. I tell you,
[1:06:10] we're living in a time that if you can
[1:06:12] be shaken, you will be shaken. We're
[1:06:15] living in a message of the hour where
[1:06:17] they can look at quotes and twist this
[1:06:19] quote and say this date and that date.
[1:06:21] But I'm here to tell you if it line
[1:06:23] still lines up with the word, I take the
[1:06:26] entire book.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; You got to line it up from Genesis to
[1:06:30] Revelation.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet of our hour, you know, they
[1:06:34] want to say this. He made I'll tell you
[1:06:36] what, to me, he may he didn't he might
[1:06:39] have made mistakes as a man, but he
[1:06:40] still brought the revealed word of God.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; And he's made Jesus Christ revealed in
[1:06:46] your day.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:49] There's many people we'll go through the
[1:06:51] airport and I I was in Dallas the other
[1:06:53] week preaching a couple weeks ago,
[1:06:55] brother Dallas David McGary's and
[1:06:57] everybody looks chaotic.
[1:06:59] You drive through there and you go up
[1:07:01] through there, everybody looks depressed
[1:07:03] 100 miles an hour
[1:07:07] and they got a void that I can walk
[1:07:10] through the AIRPORT AND SAY, "LORD, I'M
[1:07:12] SO GLAD I'M NOT ONE OF THEM.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Doesn't make me any better. I'm just It
[1:07:18] just shows me how much more grace I can
[1:07:20] take. It makes ME GO, "LORD, I'M
[1:07:23] THANKFUL FOR calling me out." WHEN YOU
[1:07:26] SEE THIS LOST WORLD DYING and going to
[1:07:29] hell
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; and you know what? Hell wasn't made for
[1:07:35] them all. He said, "Whosoever will come,
[1:07:38] let him come." His much grace is so
[1:07:41] extended to the entire world. But we
[1:07:45] forget. Maybe it's at the gas station.
[1:07:47] Maybe it's on your job. Maybe he doesn't
[1:07:49] look like you. Maybe she don't look like
[1:07:51] you. But you let God do the cleaning.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; You just be the you just be the the oil
[1:07:58] that comes on the outside and they go,
[1:08:00] "I want what he's got.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; I want what he's got."
[1:08:06] But unstable, pushed off course, shaken
[1:08:09] or shifted away from the truth of God's
[1:08:11] word. You know, I tell you, I I just
[1:08:14] believe the word of God. Once you get
[1:08:16] truly anchored in Jesus Christ, once you
[1:08:18] get anchored in this message of the
[1:08:20] hour, you will not leave
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; because you are part of God.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; You can't leave. Once you get anchored
[1:08:28] in to this truth, you can't leave. Maybe
[1:08:31] it's crossed your mind. Well, this might
[1:08:33] be THE TRUTH. THIS NO, IT IS THE TRUTH.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:41] You wouldn't know about water baptism.
[1:08:43] And I guess he does say water baptism,
[1:08:45] you don't need a revelation, but you
[1:08:46] wouldn't know what happened in the
[1:08:48] garden. You would all through the entire
[1:08:50] the entire book, all the seals were open
[1:08:53] for you, for me. God knew that we had to
[1:08:56] stand in the toughest day, the hardest
[1:08:59] day when all the hell of uh demons have
[1:09:02] released on the earth.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; But you going to get on there on that
[1:09:06] day and Paul's going to ask you how you
[1:09:09] made it.
[1:09:11] They're going to look at you and you're
[1:09:12] going to say, "How did you do it?" No,
[1:09:14] they're going to say, "No, how did you
[1:09:15] make it? I didn't even see NO LIGHT."
[1:09:17] YOU MIGHT SEE LIGHT, but there is no
[1:09:20] light.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham in his day had him
[1:09:25] come ac the the agents come across the
[1:09:27] back wall
[1:09:29] and he penciled a little. It was
[1:09:31] complete darkness.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; And he penciled a little bit of light
[1:09:36] for me and you tonight. He saw
[1:09:40] believers. He saw you, every one of you.
[1:09:43] AND HE SAID, "I'LL PENCIL A GRACE for
[1:09:45] you."
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Because he knew there'll be a small in
[1:09:49] number,
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; but mighty in Jesus Christ,
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; but be strong, unmovable. It's not in
[1:09:58] vain. You [snorts] might say, "Well,
[1:10:00] Brother Chris, I've been praising this
[1:10:02] long. I've been worship leading this
[1:10:03] long." I don't care. It's not in vain.
[1:10:06] WHEN YOU WORSHIP GOD, IT'S NOT IN VAIN.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; When you read your Bible, it's not in
[1:10:10] vain. When you get on YOUR KNEES AND
[1:10:12] PRAY, IT'S NOT IN VAIN.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; It makes you that much stronger for God.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I read a quote not long
[1:10:24] ago. He said, "You can get to a place
[1:10:26] where the devil doesn't know what to do
[1:10:29] with you." Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, when I get out of the bed,
[1:10:32] I want the devil to say, "Here he goes
[1:10:35] again."
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Joe, here he comes. HE'S WAKING
[1:10:40] UP. LORD JESUS, DON'T WAKE him up.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; LET HIM PASS ON. LET HIM GO TO GLORY.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; HE WON'T SHUT up about the truth because
[1:10:52] he knows my beginning and he knows my
[1:10:54] end.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; It's been revealed to you, brother. It's
[1:10:59] been revealed to you, sister, tonight.
[1:11:02] [snorts]
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; You might ask for a million dollars of
[1:11:04] this and that, but you've got a million
[1:11:06] dollars.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; You got more than a million dollars.
[1:11:09] You've got the entire book that's been
[1:11:12] handed to you. And what are you doing
[1:11:15] with it?
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Are you letting it sit where it be just
[1:11:20] dusty? But are you being his hands and
[1:11:22] his feet tonight?
[1:11:24] Are you into a lost world today that you
[1:11:27] can tell people about Jesus?
[1:11:30] It's so easy. I'm telling you, it's so
[1:11:33] easy just to sit there and say, "It's me
[1:11:35] and my four and no more."
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; It's easy to listen to a message and
[1:11:41] say, "Well, my family's in. I'll forget
[1:11:43] the others."
[1:11:46] But I'm hearing today that we need to
[1:11:48] stop worrying about that. We need to get
[1:11:50] as many people. I'm like on a rescue
[1:11:52] boat. Come on, keep throwing them. Keep
[1:11:55] throwing them.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; As many as you ever been on, you ever
[1:11:58] saw a cruise ship and went to a gospel
[1:12:00] cruise one time and I was telling that
[1:12:02] brother, they shut down everything. They
[1:12:04] shut by the bars. They shut It was
[1:12:06] amazing. They shut down everything. And
[1:12:09] they shut down they they had no just
[1:12:11] regular drinks. It was just amazing. But
[1:12:13] I saw these little boats and he's got
[1:12:15] these little rescue boats all down the
[1:12:16] side. And I said, "Lord, how many people
[1:12:19] on this boat needs the rescue of the
[1:12:21] Holy Ghost?
[1:12:23] How many people in this boat still are
[1:12:25] singing about you, quoting your
[1:12:27] scriptures, and on that day they'll say,
[1:12:29] "Depart from me. I never knew you."
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; But you have been get given eternal
[1:12:36] life. You've been given the key to
[1:12:39] unlock the door.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; You should walk around the out of this
[1:12:43] church today with your head held high.
[1:12:45] You should be the happiest people. I
[1:12:48] don't care what your circumstance looks.
[1:12:49] I don't care what your storm you're
[1:12:51] going through. You need to start telling
[1:12:53] your storm who your God is.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; You need to start telling your
[1:12:57] circumstance who your God is.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; You need to start not telling God what
[1:13:02] your circumstance is. Tell your
[1:13:04] circumstance who your God is.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Tell him who your God is.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; As greater is he that's in us than he
[1:13:15] that's of the world.
[1:13:18] as [snorts] we get to it. Uh, I'll try
[1:13:20] to get through it. But brother Bram says
[1:13:22] that this quote, he says, "Today, while
[1:13:24] the harvest is on, it don't say, "Let's
[1:13:27] sit down and gather sheav and sit in the
[1:13:29] house."
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; It says, "Let's go about gathering the
[1:13:34] sheav everywhere, wherever God gives you
[1:13:37] to do, you're a little housewife.
[1:13:39] Testify."
[1:13:41] He said, "Testify to the neighbors or
[1:13:43] something." He said, "Do something. and
[1:13:45] bring somebody with you when you come.
[1:13:50] He said, "I must carry home to a heaven
[1:13:52] on a flower bed of ease while others
[1:13:54] fight to win the prize."
[1:13:57] Oh, and sail through the bloody seas. He
[1:14:00] said, "No, I must fight. I must I must
[1:14:02] reign. Increase my courage, Lord." He
[1:14:05] said, "That's my prayer." Amen.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; He says, "Tell tell me not in mournal
[1:14:11] moral numbers, mortal numbers, life is
[1:14:14] just an empty dream."
[1:14:17] He is quoting this little uh psalm or
[1:14:19] song. He says, "And the soul is dead
[1:14:22] that slumbers and things are not what
[1:14:24] they seem." Yeah. Life is real and life
[1:14:27] is earnest. And the grave is not its
[1:14:31] goal. Dust thou earth to dust to
[1:14:33] returnest was not speakest to the soul.
[1:14:38] He said that's right. He said lives of
[1:14:40] great men all remind us
[1:14:43] and we have make our lives sublime with
[1:14:47] partings behi left leave behind us
[1:14:50] footprints on the sands of time.
[1:14:54] He said foot pits to perhaps another
[1:14:57] selling over life solemn. He said for a
[1:15:00] four-long and shipwreck brother sin
[1:15:03] shall take heart again. [snorts] He goes
[1:15:06] on to say, he says, in the power of
[1:15:08] decision, if a man once anchors, listen
[1:15:10] to this, if a one if a man once anchors
[1:15:13] his heart against the heart of Calvary,
[1:15:15] all devils in hell will never shake him
[1:15:18] no more.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; He said he's there. He said, notice, he
[1:15:25] said, for he that cannot stand
[1:15:27] chastisement is an illegitimate child.
[1:15:31] He said he claims God to be his father
[1:15:34] when he's not. He's just tossed about by
[1:15:36] every wind of doctrine, not stable.
[1:15:38] Don't you think that's the day we live
[1:15:40] in? And don't know where he's going.
[1:15:43] He's doubleminded and a lot of times
[1:15:46] double tonged and don't know where he's
[1:15:48] standing or what you're talking about.
[1:15:52] He goes on to say, "Then a man that's
[1:15:54] born again of the spirit OF GOD KNOWS
[1:15:57] EXACTLY WHERE HE'S AT."
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right. there. Nothing
[1:16:02] phases him because something on the
[1:16:05] inside of him has already witnessed
[1:16:08] somebody outside the cloud yonder.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "And by faith, he sees him." Do
[1:16:16] you see him tonight? Maybe you don't see
[1:16:19] him spiritually, but on the heart, you
[1:16:21] should feel that theophony pulling you
[1:16:24] to a higher place.
[1:16:26] You should be like, I don't know WHY THE
[1:16:28] GRAVITY IS holding me here, but I'm here
[1:16:30] to tell you this BODY IS NOT MADE. I
[1:16:33] belong to that body.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; I like that song my wife sings. I think
[1:16:40] it goes they'll we'll speed up and
[1:16:42] they'll slow down.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for that day. I'm waiting
[1:16:46] for my mother to walk through that door
[1:16:48] between that sixth and nine hour
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; and say, "Son, everything you preached
[1:16:54] about, everything you talked about,
[1:16:56] everything you stroll about, all the
[1:16:58] miles YOU DROVE WERE NOT IN VAIN.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; All the times you came to church, all
[1:17:04] the times you pray, all the times you
[1:17:07] READ YOUR BIBLE WAS NOT IN VAIN."
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; You could put all your time here. YOU
[1:17:15] PUT ALL YOUR TIME HERE. Where's your
[1:17:17] time spent?
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Whether the planes are
[1:17:25] rocking, whether the lightnings are
[1:17:27] flashing, whether the spies has gun on
[1:17:29] me, whether it is, it doesn't matter.
[1:17:31] I'm going to press. I'm going to sit
[1:17:34] down in the battle.
[1:17:36] I'm going to press the battle by the
[1:17:39] grace OF GOD WHILE I PREACH THE GOSPEL
[1:17:42] to every creature and every person that
[1:17:45] I can.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Persuading them. He said persuading them
[1:17:51] to he said to do to to that beautiful
[1:17:54] land yonder. I'm here to persuade you
[1:17:58] today. You don't want to miss it for the
[1:18:00] world.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; You can miss ball game. You could be
[1:18:04] late for dinner. You could be missed
[1:18:06] every single appointment. But don't miss
[1:18:10] this one appointment.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Don't miss the appointment that the ark
[1:18:15] door is closing.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I went here to tell you venture to say
[1:18:20] when he built the ark for 120 years. You
[1:18:24] don't think he got criticism?
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; He's like, "Well, well, why?" Well, you
[1:18:29] think about the message believers today
[1:18:31] or people that come and get the message.
[1:18:33] Well, Noah, I just got a question.
[1:18:35] Wouldn't you build the the boat near the
[1:18:37] water?
[1:18:39] Why would you just pick a big boat that
[1:18:41] we've had no rain and you're going to
[1:18:42] put it out in the over here and no?
[1:18:45] Well, cuz I'm going to show you how big
[1:18:46] my God is
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; for 120 years. Yes, he probably went
[1:18:52] through a lot and a lot and a lot of
[1:18:54] hatreds, name calling
[1:18:58] or brandites or whatever they want to
[1:19:00] call you. But I'm here to tell you, one
[1:19:02] day they're GOING TO CALL YOU GONE.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; That's the day you should be striving
[1:19:07] for.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; That's why I drive millions and hundreds
[1:19:12] of miles or whatever it is JUST FOR SEE
[1:19:15] ONE MORE soul get the kingdom of God.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; He says whether it's not matter. He says
[1:19:24] persuading them to go look at the land
[1:19:26] you're under. I [snorts] like what
[1:19:28] Galatians 6:9 says. We're talking about
[1:19:31] uh it's not in vain. It says let us not
[1:19:34] be weary and welloing.
[1:19:37] There's nothing in here that says sit
[1:19:39] down.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in my Bible that tells
[1:19:42] you to go sit down and hang out and just
[1:19:45] relax cuz you got all the truth.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; It says let us be not be weary and
[1:19:51] welloing for in due season we shall reap
[1:19:54] if we faint not.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. Hebrews 6:10 uh 6:10.
[1:20:00] For God is not unrighteous to forget
[1:20:03] your work and labor of what? Love
[1:20:08] which you have showed toward his name.
[1:20:11] It says in in that you have ministered
[1:20:14] to saints and do minister. Isaiah, I'm
[1:20:17] just reminding you Isaiah 55:11. So
[1:20:20] shall my word be that goeth forth out of
[1:20:23] my mouth. It shall not return unto me
[1:20:26] void.
[1:20:28] But it shall accomplish that which I
[1:20:30] please, and it shall prosper in the
[1:20:33] things where I see it.
[1:20:36] Psalms 126. We'd be here all night
[1:20:38] showing you stuff that's not in vain.
[1:20:41] [snorts]
[1:20:41] Psalms 126 5-6. They that sow in tears
[1:20:46] reap in joy. He that goeth forth and
[1:20:49] weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
[1:20:52] doubtless come again with rejoicing,
[1:20:55] bringing his sheav with him. The prophet
[1:20:58] of God says, he goes on to say, he said,
[1:21:00] but it's accepting the person in Christ
[1:21:02] Jesus.
[1:21:04] And these other things that come right
[1:21:05] on in and they fit together. He said,
[1:21:08] "Let every member in this body this
[1:21:10] morning, let this little group of
[1:21:12] people," he said, "if you could pull the
[1:21:14] curtain down." Listen, if you could pull
[1:21:17] the curtains down along each side, every
[1:21:22] person in here to receive the person in
[1:21:24] Christ Jesus, there would never be a
[1:21:28] fuss.
[1:21:31] There would never be an argument.
[1:21:34] Oh my. He said, "I just be perfect. It
[1:21:37] would just be perfect love.
[1:21:41] Yeah, you'd still believe this and
[1:21:43] believe that, but I I He said, I just be
[1:21:45] so full of love. He said, now Jesus
[1:21:49] said, by your fruit you shall know them.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; And the fruit of the spirit is what?
[1:21:55] Love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:21:57] gentleness, meekness, gentleness.
[1:22:01] goes on to say, he says, 'Now, he said,
[1:22:04] 'I give you my estimation of what I
[1:22:06] think that the closest thing to an
[1:22:08] evidence that a man is a Christian than
[1:22:11] anything I know of. You know what it is?
[1:22:14] It's a travail of a soul.
[1:22:18] A person that's always so hungering, he
[1:22:21] didn't say sit back and not eat.
[1:22:25] He says, he said always hungering and
[1:22:28] thirsting of God.
[1:22:30] He said, 'Th that's just simply the day
[1:22:32] and night. They just can't stand it.
[1:22:34] They've got to do something for God.
[1:22:39] [snorts]
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; They're full of love and they just their
[1:22:41] soul travails. They're travail almost.
[1:22:43] The Bible said, "He that goeth forth so
[1:22:46] to tears would doubtless return again
[1:22:49] rejoicing bringing him with precious
[1:22:51] sheav." So in other words, get to work.
[1:22:57] In other words, as my grandfather would
[1:23:00] say, put the pedal to the metal.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Don't sit back and relax. It's not a
[1:23:06] time to sit back and relax. It's a time
[1:23:08] to press on. It's the time, you know,
[1:23:11] when he went behind the uh when when
[1:23:12] they brought his when he went over to
[1:23:14] the uh he pulled his way in the other
[1:23:15] dimension and he was sitting on the bed
[1:23:17] and his his hands around him and he went
[1:23:19] to the other dimension, he didn't want
[1:23:21] to get back in that body and he came
[1:23:24] back and he said, "You don't want to
[1:23:25] miss it for the world.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; You don't want to miss it." He couldn't
[1:23:31] even describe how beautiful it was.
[1:23:34] He did a little bit, but he couldn't
[1:23:36] even You couldn't even taste how
[1:23:38] heaven's going to be.
[1:23:40] But I'm here to tell you, give it all
[1:23:42] you got for Jesus. Young people, sell
[1:23:45] out to God. Don't sell out to drugs,
[1:23:48] alcohol, lust, everything of this world.
[1:23:52] Give your life to Jesus now.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Give it to Christ.
[1:23:59] As first Corinthians says set three
[1:24:02] [snorts] verse 7-9
[1:24:05] so that he neither then neither is he
[1:24:08] that planteth anything neither he that
[1:24:10] waterth but God that giveth what? The
[1:24:14] increase. You don't have to worry about
[1:24:16] the increase. You just you just bring it
[1:24:19] to God and let him do the increase.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:22] Now he that planteth, he that waterth
[1:24:25] are one, and every man shall receive his
[1:24:28] own reward according to his own labor.
[1:24:32] Verse nine, for we are what? Laborers
[1:24:36] together. I say us together with God. Ye
[1:24:41] are God's husbander and ye are God's
[1:24:44] building.
[1:24:46] Oh, I love that. I just got a lot of
[1:24:49] scriptures I'm finishing. Philippians
[1:24:51] 2:16, holding forth the world of life
[1:24:54] that I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[1:24:56] that I have not run in vain.
[1:25:00] Can you imagine on that day people
[1:25:02] singing in his name, people traveling
[1:25:04] the world in his name, big artist, big
[1:25:07] fame,
[1:25:10] Michael Jordan, all these people making
[1:25:13] millions and billions of dollars,
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; but they don't have one thing that you
[1:25:18] got.
[1:25:20] Can you imagine on that day when they
[1:25:22] get there, that money ain't going to
[1:25:24] matter anymore.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Because we all go if we we go by the
[1:25:29] grave, we all go by that six-foot hole.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; But when we meet Jesus Christ, he said
[1:25:35] every knee shall bow, every tongue will
[1:25:38] confess that day. Even the atheists will
[1:25:40] have to confess.
[1:25:44] They will have to even bow to that name,
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; But you should the happiest people
[1:25:52] tonight.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; You really should. We should. We should
[1:25:56] not wake up all dreary and down and out
[1:25:59] every day and get up and go, "Well, I'm
[1:26:01] just going to barely MAKE IT." NO,
[1:26:03] YOU'VE ALREADY MADE IT.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; God has opened the book. HE'S GAVE IT TO
[1:26:08] YOU.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; It's you. You got to accept it.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; That the door, if I walked IN THAT DOOR,
[1:26:16] GOD IS KNOCKING AT that door tonight.
[1:26:18] Maybe he's taking that door tonight. And
[1:26:20] maybe, I don't know, this ain't in my
[1:26:21] notes, but maybe he's standing at the
[1:26:24] door knocking tonight.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Do you hear that? Tonight, God might be
[1:26:29] knocking at your door tonight saying,
[1:26:31] "Let me in."
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Because guess what? You're on the inside
[1:26:36] of that door and you have to open it.
[1:26:39] Our God is a gentleman. Jesus Christ is
[1:26:42] a gentleman. And he wants you to open
[1:26:45] the door. And not just your living room,
[1:26:47] not just your kitchen, but your master
[1:26:49] bedroom, your bedroom, all the doors of
[1:26:52] own doors.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; And maybe you should go home and just
[1:26:56] clean out some stuff tonight. Kick stuff
[1:26:58] out.
[1:27:00] I don't know what it is, but I'm here to
[1:27:03] tell you, maybe it's a house cleaning
[1:27:04] time, sir.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Maybe you do this. maybe do that. I
[1:27:09] always tell my boys, yeah, my boys had
[1:27:11] the phone the other day. I said, "You
[1:27:13] control this. It doesn't control you."
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; And let Jesus get on the inside and let
[1:27:22] him control you. Let him be your power.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. I'm telling you, when
[1:27:31] you get there on that day, we'll say,
[1:27:32] "Brother Chris, well, you remember that
[1:27:34] service we had? Praise God. It was not
[1:27:36] in vain. Brother Joe, I'm tell you what,
[1:27:39] I'm gonna be dancing. Whatever y'all
[1:27:41] want to do, I'm gonna be dancing.
[1:27:42] Whatever. I'm tell you what, I I'll be
[1:27:44] dancing like David danced. Maybe you'll
[1:27:47] be crying. Maybe you'll be shouting.
[1:27:49] Whatever it is,
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; but I tell you what, I take you all to a
[1:27:53] ball game tonight. I bet you wouldn't
[1:27:55] sit just
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; It's the fourth quarter.
[1:28:01] We got 236 races. Say we We're on the
[1:28:04] We're on the second race. where we got
[1:28:07] we done went 300 laps in NASCAR.
[1:28:11] I've been there when I was in the world.
[1:28:15] [snorts] Not saying nothing against it.
[1:28:16] I'm just telling you my dad took me and
[1:28:18] I sat there and I'll never forget we
[1:28:20] watched your brother Joe. We were down
[1:28:21] to like 300. He said, "Hey, you want to
[1:28:23] beat the crowd?"
[1:28:26] I'm like, "Dad, we got 15 laps left. Are
[1:28:30] you crazy?" Like, I want to watch this.
[1:28:35] But how is that our life, guys? Don't I
[1:28:38] don't think we got but five laps left.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; It's dark out there.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; We're down to the last five laps.
[1:28:49] Don't give up. We're down. It's like
[1:28:53] dad's like, "All right, let's go. Let's
[1:28:54] beat him to the car." Here we are. We're
[1:28:56] rushing to the car and we parked like
[1:28:58] 100 miles away.
[1:29:01] I'm like, "If we're going to park A 100
[1:29:02] MILES AWAY, WHY WHY DIDN'T WE WAIT THE
[1:29:05] LAST lap
[1:29:08] and then we leave? We get out there in 5
[1:29:09] minutes." He said, "See, I bet you they
[1:29:11] waited three hours. I waited to see the
[1:29:13] end."
[1:29:16] I don't know about you, BUT WE'RE NOT
[1:29:18] GOING THROUGH TRIALS AND tribulations
[1:29:20] and and trolling through life and
[1:29:22] reading our Bible and praying for just
[1:29:24] not
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; it's NOT IN VAIN. WE'RE LAST TO LAST
[1:29:29] LAP. WE'RE COMING AROUND the last
[1:29:31] corner.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; We're coming around the last corner. And
[1:29:36] I'm here to tell you to get in.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; If I got to provoke you to get, I got to
[1:29:42] pick you up and put you in. Let's go.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; It's time to go.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; We're about to take liftoff.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; It's about a count. It's a countdown
[1:29:54] time.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; We're living in a countdown day. And
[1:29:58] young people, I want to tell you to I
[1:30:00] tell you, sell out to Jesus.
[1:30:03] [snorts]
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; I didn't do it. But I'm here to tell
[1:30:05] you, if I could do it all over, there's
[1:30:07] a lot of things I would change. And I'm
[1:30:10] still reaping what I sowed.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; But you sew the right seeds.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Live for God. [snorts] Find a faithful.
[1:30:20] Find some If you date somebody, make
[1:30:23] sure they love God more than they love
[1:30:24] you.
[1:30:30] I didn't have that in my notes, but
[1:30:31] there it was. 1 Thessalonians 3:5. For
[1:30:35] this cause, when I could no longer be
[1:30:38] forebear, I sent to you to know your
[1:30:40] faith, least by some means the tempter
[1:30:43] have tempted you, and your labor is
[1:30:45] what?
[1:30:47] Not in vain.
[1:30:49] Your labor is not in vain. Matthew 6:6.
[1:30:52] But now, when thou prayest, enter into
[1:30:55] thy closet, [snorts] and thou what has
[1:30:58] shut the door, pray, thy father, which
[1:31:00] is in secret, and thy father will seeth
[1:31:02] in secret, shall reward thee openly.
[1:31:07] [snorts] Maybe it's sometime tonight,
[1:31:08] maybe just just lay down your bed and
[1:31:11] just get on your knees and say, "Lord, I
[1:31:13] just want to tell you I love you.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to ask for
[1:31:18] anything. I just want to tell you I love
[1:31:20] you.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Maybe young people, you get at your your
[1:31:25] bed and just lift your hands and say,
[1:31:27] "Lord, I don't even know what to say to
[1:31:28] you. All I know to tell you is I love
[1:31:30] you.
[1:31:32] It will not be in vain."
[1:31:35] I thought about where we're talking
[1:31:36] about Noah. [snorts]
[1:31:39] The people mocked him. They ignored him.
[1:31:41] You know what also? They rejected his
[1:31:43] message
[1:31:45] for 120 years. They rejected his
[1:31:48] message. And the prophet of God brought
[1:31:50] his message in his day. and it was
[1:31:52] rejected.
[1:31:53] It was turned down from the US.
[1:31:56] But guess what? You've accepted it.
[1:32:00] You've accepted it. That should put
[1:32:03] something on the inside tonight.
[1:32:06] I know everybody's probably tired and
[1:32:07] weary and got full of mashed potatoes,
[1:32:11] but our God's still good.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; But think about his obedience. It was
[1:32:17] not in vain. God [snorts] kept his word.
[1:32:20] And guess what? The ark what? It floated
[1:32:23] through every trial.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; He built this ark for 120 years. And all
[1:32:28] them task masters were looking down at
[1:32:29] him. And brother Bram said he put one
[1:32:32] window in the ark where he could look
[1:32:34] up.
[1:32:36] And I'm here to tell you, if you don't
[1:32:38] have any other window in your life, look
[1:32:40] up and know where your blessings are
[1:32:42] coming from. Look up and say, "Lord, I'm
[1:32:45] thankful for all your benefits."
[1:32:49] If he doesn't do one more thing for you,
[1:32:52] he's still good.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; He's still worthy of our praise. He's
[1:32:56] still worthy of everything we got. If he
[1:32:58] don't do anything before you, if your
[1:33:00] power bill don't get paid, your lights
[1:33:02] get shut off.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; He's still good.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; His obedience preserved, Think about
[1:33:11] this. I wrote this down. His obedience
[1:33:13] preserved the future of humanity.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; I thought about Elijah. Let's turn there
[1:33:20] real quick. First Kings 18
[1:33:24] Kings
[1:33:26] 18.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Elijah on Mount Carmel.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; And I thought, look at Elijah was here
[1:33:40] with the prophets of Bal.
[1:33:43] 450 prophets grows 400 850 false
[1:33:47] prophets. Think about this. Israel
[1:33:51] doubted. The kings resisted him. Think
[1:33:54] about this. Some things I wrote down.
[1:33:56] God answered with fire.
[1:33:58] It was not in vain. Listen to this in
[1:34:00] verse 22 of 18. He says, "Then Elijah
[1:34:03] said unto the people, I remain a prophet
[1:34:06] of the Lord and but Baal's prophet are
[1:34:08] 450 men." He said, "Let them therefore
[1:34:11] give us two bollocks, and they choose
[1:34:13] one bo of themselves, and they [snorts]
[1:34:16] lay the wood, they put on the fire,
[1:34:18] and he called on the name of your gods.
[1:34:22] And I'll call on my name of what?" The
[1:34:25] Lord.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; They called on a bunch of gods. You
[1:34:29] don't need a bunch of gods. You just
[1:34:31] need one Lord.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; You need one experience with our Lord.
[1:34:36] You don't need a bunch of worldly gods.
[1:34:38] You don't need a bunch of this and that.
[1:34:40] You just need one experience with the
[1:34:43] Lord.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, he says, "But let
[1:34:46] him," he said, he answered in verse 24,
[1:34:49] he said, "And they called on the name of
[1:34:51] their gods, of your gods, and I'll call
[1:34:54] on the name of the Lord."
[1:34:57] And the God that answered by fire, let
[1:34:59] him be God. And [snorts] all the people
[1:35:01] of Ezra said, "It's well spoken." And
[1:35:03] Elijah said unto your prophets, "Choose
[1:35:06] you one bullet yourself, and dress it
[1:35:07] the first, for ye are many." And he
[1:35:10] called on the name of the gods on of
[1:35:12] your gods, but no fire under.
[1:35:16] And they that took the bulock were given
[1:35:18] to the dressed it, and called the name
[1:35:20] of Bale from the [snorts] morning until
[1:35:22] noon, saying, "Oh Bale, hear us." But
[1:35:25] here was no voice, no answer. And they
[1:35:28] leaped upon the altar which was made.
[1:35:31] And it came to pass at noon, verse 27.
[1:35:34] I'm showing you something that's not in
[1:35:35] vain. Elijah mocked them and said, "Cry
[1:35:38] aloud, for he is a god." Either he's
[1:35:41] talking or he's pursu pursuing or he's
[1:35:44] journey or or maybe he's asleep.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe your god is asleep.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Maybe you need to wake him up.
[1:35:54] That's what he said. He must be
[1:35:56] awakened.
[1:35:57] He goes on to say, basically, I put in
[1:36:00] my notes, he's not responding.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; His gods are not responding.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; But let me show you something that's not
[1:36:07] in vain. And they cried aloud and they
[1:36:10] cut themselves and their manner which
[1:36:12] knives and and lassets until they blood
[1:36:15] gushed out of them. And it came to pass
[1:36:17] the midday pass that prophesied until
[1:36:19] the time offering and eating sacrifice.
[1:36:22] And there was neither voice nor any
[1:36:24] answer in any that regarding Elijah said
[1:36:27] unto all the people come near unto me.
[1:36:30] All the people came unto him and they
[1:36:32] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[1:36:34] broken down. Elijah took 12 stones
[1:36:37] according to the number of tribes of
[1:36:38] Jacob. Let's [snorts] just skip down for
[1:36:41] time. Verse 33. And he put the wood in
[1:36:43] the order of the cut of the pieces of
[1:36:45] the boan pieces and laid them on the the
[1:36:48] wood. And he filled four barrels with
[1:36:50] water. He filled it with the burnt
[1:36:52] sacrifice on the wood and he said, "Do
[1:36:55] it a second time." He said, "Do it
[1:36:58] again." And he said, "Do it a third
[1:37:00] time." And they did it a third time. And
[1:37:02] the water ran about all through the
[1:37:04] altar and filled the trench also with
[1:37:06] water. That's how confidence he was in
[1:37:09] his God.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Not just do it one time, but let me tell
[1:37:13] you, do it again.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And do it again. and then fill the whole
[1:37:19] trench up with water.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; And [snorts] then he goes on to say, I'm
[1:37:24] just showing you, he knew his God was
[1:37:25] not in vain. And he said to him, "And it
[1:37:29] came to pass, verse 36, and the time of
[1:37:32] the offering of the evening sacrifice,
[1:37:33] the legion of Elijah the prophet came
[1:37:35] near, and the Lord God of Abraham,
[1:37:37] Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known
[1:37:39] this day that thou art a God of Israel,
[1:37:42] and thou am I thy servant. Thou have
[1:37:45] done all these things in thy word. Hear
[1:37:48] [snorts]
[1:37:48] me, oh God. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me. I
[1:37:51] think some of us tonight could just say,
[1:37:53] "God, hear me, oh Lord." When's the last
[1:37:56] time you called on your Lord? And said,
[1:37:59] "I'm in this situation. I've told
[1:38:01] everybody about it. I've let all the
[1:38:03] Facebook know, but when have I let you
[1:38:05] know?
[1:38:08] When have I said, "Lord, here am I."
[1:38:13] He goes on to say
[1:38:16] he verse he says servant he said I've
[1:38:18] done all these things in the word he
[1:38:19] said hear me oh lord hear me that these
[1:38:22] people may know that they are lord our
[1:38:24] god I would say that tonight hear me oh
[1:38:27] lord that you hear that the ark door is
[1:38:30] closing
[1:38:33] then the fire of the lord fell and
[1:38:35] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:38:37] wood and stones and dust not just the
[1:38:39] wood just the stones not just the dust.
[1:38:42] But I'm tell you how powerful our God
[1:38:44] is. He licked all the water that was in
[1:38:46] the trench. He even licked the dust off
[1:38:49] the ground.
[1:38:51] [snorts]
[1:38:52] THAT'S OUR GOD. THAT'S YOUR GOD TONIGHT.
[1:38:55] If he can do it for him, you can lift
[1:38:57] him up out of history and he can do it
[1:39:00] for you.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; He just took the dust. It took the
[1:39:06] stones, the dust, the wood. It looked up
[1:39:08] all the water in the trench. And all
[1:39:10] these people saw and fell on their faces
[1:39:12] and they said, "The Lord God, he is the
[1:39:14] God. The Lord, the Lord, he is the God."
[1:39:18] Aren't you thankful? We were in Israel
[1:39:20] when we went by the tomb. We have an
[1:39:22] empty tomb today.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go to Israel to see
[1:39:25] it. It should be in your heart.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; You should know that he's been risen and
[1:39:31] he lives on individuals, me and you,
[1:39:33] tonight.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; That you're not just here taking up air.
[1:39:38] Maybe maybe some of us are, but not all
[1:39:40] of us.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; And like I was saying, you could go to a
[1:39:45] ball game tonight. I remember I never
[1:39:46] forget, brother Joe, I went to a
[1:39:48] baseball game one time and I was
[1:39:49] screaming and yelling and my boy goes,
[1:39:51] "Daddy, I hope you do that on Sunday.
[1:39:55] He got me back."
[1:39:57] And on Sunday, I was bringing it
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; cuz I said, "Lord, I'm not going to let
[1:40:04] that ball I'm not going to worship that
[1:40:06] ball more than I worship you."
[1:40:08] [cheering]
[1:40:09] [applause]
[1:40:14] [cheering]
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; And that's how we should be. I'm not
[1:40:17] saying be so legalism where you can't do
[1:40:19] this and you can't do this and you can't
[1:40:21] and you're just like a robot. Well,
[1:40:23] that's just a book of laws. No, you
[1:40:25] should be living on the inside. You
[1:40:27] should have a life and you should enjoy
[1:40:30] life and you should get out here and be
[1:40:32] the best Christian you can be. Wherever
[1:40:34] it's on the ball field or maybe it's on
[1:40:36] your job or wherever you're at, you can
[1:40:39] be the best Christian you can be.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; But too many times we take a message and
[1:40:44] we go, "Hey boys, it's a book. Let me
[1:40:47] beat you with it.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Let me beat you with this Bible." And
[1:40:52] before you know it, they're way down the
[1:40:53] street somewhere
[1:40:55] and they don't want nothing what you
[1:40:56] got.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell my boys all the time,
[1:41:00] this is the best life you can have. You
[1:41:03] can be the fun. You can have the best
[1:41:05] life and have the funnest time as a
[1:41:06] Christian.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for the balance tonight.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; I tell you, get in the middle. Don't get
[1:41:17] too far to the left and so legalism to
[1:41:19] the right, but get in the middle of the
[1:41:21] road. Someone said, "Well, you're going
[1:41:23] to get hit." No, it's a one-way street
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; and it's going to glory.
[1:41:28] [snorts]
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; I thought about Ruth as we come down to
[1:41:31] a close and I just want to bring out
[1:41:34] something with Ruth tonight.
[1:41:37] I'll try to hurry where you don't fall
[1:41:39] asleep. But but I just thought three I
[1:41:42] thought about Ruth, if you turn to Ruth
[1:41:44] real quick, that she knew her God was
[1:41:46] not in vain.
[1:41:48] I thought I was just praising the Lord
[1:41:50] back there thinking about Ruth. You know
[1:41:52] what? That's your book. That's me and
[1:41:55] you today. That's our love letter to the
[1:41:58] bride tonight.
[1:42:00] That book was written for me and you to
[1:42:02] look back and you [snorts] know what?
[1:42:03] She was a Moabitete and I didn't even
[1:42:04] deserving to be in that lineage of Boaz.
[1:42:08] You were a gentile. You we were not me
[1:42:11] and you were not even in the lineage of
[1:42:13] of the Je of back to the Jews. But God
[1:42:16] by his grace and mercy turned from his
[1:42:18] own children to say, "Hey, here's some
[1:42:21] grace. Here's some light for our day."
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; He blinded his own kid, his children to
[1:42:27] say, "Hey, there's more Gentiles."
[1:42:30] But I like what Ruth and I'll try to be
[1:42:32] quick with it, but he goes on to say
[1:42:33] about Ruth, how it was not in vain. And
[1:42:36] I like what it said. You know the book
[1:42:37] of Ruth. Most people probably know the
[1:42:39] book of Ruth. If you get a chance, it's
[1:42:40] only for it's only four. So if you can
[1:42:43] read it, it's wonderful. I just I read
[1:42:45] it all the time. I love it. But I just
[1:42:47] think about what a love story it is to
[1:42:48] us
[1:42:50] that here she is that Moab and Orpa.
[1:42:53] [snorts]
[1:42:54] Here she is going to Moab. And there
[1:42:57] were women of Moab and Orpa and Ruth.
[1:42:59] And you think about it, they had a
[1:43:01] choice to follow after her her sons
[1:43:04] died. Naomi, they asked Ruth, she said,
[1:43:07] "Ruth, entreat me not to leave thee or
[1:43:10] return." Verse six, and Ruth, verse uh
[1:43:12] chapter 1, it says, "After thee, for
[1:43:14] whether thou goest or whether thou
[1:43:17] lodest, I'll lodge. Let my people be thy
[1:43:20] people and and and thy God be my God. I
[1:43:24] tell you, I think that's where a place
[1:43:26] we got to get in our life where I I want
[1:43:30] I want to see Jesus Christ.
[1:43:32] And she goes on to say, he goes,
[1:43:34] [snorts] she goes, verse 18 says, when
[1:43:36] she saw that that she was steadfast,
[1:43:39] listen, when Ruth was steadfastly minded
[1:43:41] to go with her, then she left speaking
[1:43:44] unto her. She tried to convince her,
[1:43:46] hey, you don't need to go. I can't have
[1:43:48] more kids. I don't know who you're
[1:43:50] looking for. No, I'm just following the
[1:43:52] God that's inside of you.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; In verse [snorts] chapter two, I like
[1:43:57] it. This is what I want to go on to.
[1:43:59] It's not in vain. And Naomi has a
[1:44:02] kinsman of her husbands and a mighty man
[1:44:04] in chapter 2. Verse one, a mighty man of
[1:44:07] wealth and family, Amalecch, and his
[1:44:09] name was Boaz. Do you know you have a
[1:44:11] mighty man of wealth?
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; He owns a cattle on a thousand hills.
[1:44:18] He [snorts] has everything in the palm
[1:44:20] of his hands
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; and that's your Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Put [snorts] your name there tonight.
[1:44:27] And Ruth the Moabitete said unto Naomi,
[1:44:29] "Let me now go into the field and glean
[1:44:32] ears of ears of corn after him in whose
[1:44:35] sight I shall find grace." And she said
[1:44:38] unto her, "Go, go, my daughter."
[1:44:42] And she [snorts] went, and she came and
[1:44:44] gleaned into the field after the
[1:44:46] reapers. and he and her and and Hap was
[1:44:49] the light a part of part of the field
[1:44:51] belonging to Mo Boaz.
[1:44:53] Ain't that awesome? She steps into the
[1:44:56] field that was already prepared for her.
[1:45:02] Think about it tonight. God has put a
[1:45:04] field out before you tonight to step
[1:45:06] into.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Don't reap in any other
[1:45:10] field. Don't go to any denominations.
[1:45:13] You're reaping straight from the word of
[1:45:14] God. You're reaping straight from heaven
[1:45:17] tonight.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't go in any other field
[1:45:21] belong." He said, "The field belong to
[1:45:23] Boaz who has the kingdom of Amalecch."
[1:45:26] Did you know your field tonight is from
[1:45:28] Amalecch, from Jesus Christ? You're
[1:45:30] reaping from him. And it came, listen to
[1:45:33] this verse uh let's just get down to
[1:45:36] verse six. And the servant was set over
[1:45:39] reapers answered and said, "Is it a
[1:45:41] Moabit Moabish woman dam damsel that
[1:45:44] came back with Naomi out of the country
[1:45:46] of Moab?" And she said, "I" and he said,
[1:45:49] and she said, I pray, let me glean and
[1:45:52] gather all the reapers among the sheavs.
[1:45:54] So she came and hath continued even from
[1:45:57] the morning until now. Then she terried
[1:45:59] a little in the house. Do you know she
[1:46:01] had work to do? She didn't just sit back
[1:46:04] and relax. She gleaned. She worked in
[1:46:07] the field. You have work to do.
[1:46:11] Don't stop.
[1:46:13] Goes on to say verse 8, as the musicians
[1:46:16] come, then said Boaz and to Ruth,
[1:46:19] "Hearest thou thou not, my daughter, go
[1:46:22] not to glean in another field." And I
[1:46:25] will here to tell you tonight, don't go
[1:46:27] to any other denominational field and
[1:46:29] glean in. There's not another field,
[1:46:32] church. There's not another field,
[1:46:35] saints, to glean in. You've been given
[1:46:38] the best field to glean in.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour has came in your
[1:46:44] day, and you are gleaning in God's
[1:46:46] field.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; And I'll finish this. And it says, "Let
[1:46:51] thine eyes be on the field, and thy do
[1:46:54] after them. I have not charged the young
[1:46:57] men. You shall not touch thee."
[1:47:00] Not only that, you go clean glean in my
[1:47:02] field and I'll put a shield of
[1:47:04] protection around you.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Did you know when you driving down that
[1:47:08] road, angels are probably in between
[1:47:10] them lines? That's
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Because God, when until he's done with
[1:47:15] you and pulls your card, he says the
[1:47:17] devil can't do nothing to you. He said
[1:47:19] the devil can't even do nothing to you
[1:47:21] unless God permits it.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; And it goes on to say, you shall touch
[1:47:28] them not. you shall not touch thee. And
[1:47:30] when thou art, he says, when thy vessels
[1:47:32] and they drink, verse nine, thou which
[1:47:35] are young men have drawn. Verse 10, then
[1:47:37] she fell on her face and bowed herself
[1:47:39] to the ground and said unto him,
[1:47:42] why have I found grace in thine eyes? I
[1:47:45] think tonight you can look to me, look
[1:47:47] to the field, you can look to Jesus
[1:47:49] Christ, not to me, but you can look to
[1:47:51] Jesus Christ and fall on your face and
[1:47:53] say, "How have I found grace in thy
[1:47:56] sight?
[1:47:57] How have you gave me the entire book and
[1:47:59] it's been opened? The entire seals, all
[1:48:02] the book has been revealed. You are
[1:48:04] gleaning in heavenly places
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; and you should fall on your face tonight
[1:48:09] and say, Lord, I'm not worthy,
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; but you made me worthy.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; As I play something softly, I like verse
[1:48:18] 11. And it says, "And Boaz answered and
[1:48:19] said unto her, it hath fully been showed
[1:48:22] to me all thy and thy mother-in-law and
[1:48:25] death of thine husband." But listen to
[1:48:28] this verse 12 and we'll close. The Lord
[1:48:30] replic rep repreants [music] thy work
[1:48:33] and what? A full reward.
[1:48:38] He's gave you a full reward tonight.
[1:48:41] He's gave you his son that died on the
[1:48:44] cross, shed his blood
[1:48:49] and it's not [music] in vain.
[1:48:51] It's not in vain when you come to
[1:48:53] church. It's not in vain when you
[1:48:55] worship God. It's not in vain when
[1:48:57] you're in your car and you're praising
[1:48:58] God. It's not in vain when you listen to
[1:49:01] the tapes. It's not in vain
[1:49:04] when you pray in your clothes or you
[1:49:06] pray by yourself or pray in your car or
[1:49:08] you sing in your car. It's not in vain.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; You're entertaining angels unaware.
[1:49:17] You could be singing in your car. You
[1:49:19] could be in the worst mood and all of a
[1:49:21] sudden the presence of God drop in.
[1:49:24] Maybe some of you just need to let go
[1:49:26] and just let your hair down and say,
[1:49:28] "God, I don't care who looks [music] at
[1:49:29] my left. I don't care who looks at my
[1:49:31] right tonight. I just want to praise
[1:49:33] you. I want to tell you I love you. I
[1:49:35] want to tell you what you done for me,
[1:49:37] what you where you brought me from and
[1:49:39] where I'm going today.
[1:49:42] Where I could have been and where you
[1:49:44] are. Look at what God might look at your
[1:49:46] past, but look what he's doing for you
[1:49:49] today.
[1:49:51] Don't focus on the rearview mirror of
[1:49:53] life. Look what he's doing for you
[1:49:55] today. Look where he's brought you from,
[1:49:57] young ones.
[1:49:59] And if you haven't experienced that, I
[1:50:02] tell you to get to Jesus.
[1:50:05] Get to Jesus. It will not be in vain. I
[1:50:09] pray this stits in your in your life so
[1:50:11] hard that you realize that it's not in
[1:50:15] vain.
[1:50:16] This message is not in vain. The prophet
[1:50:18] of God didn't iron his suits in his car.
[1:50:21] He didn't have no money.
[1:50:24] He brought a message for me and you. And
[1:50:27] we're reaping what he put in the field.
[1:50:30] He put the field out. He's plowed the
[1:50:33] fields. And we're reaping what he's
[1:50:35] plowed.
[1:50:37] He's put it all out there. You get into
[1:50:39] the message. You get into these tapes
[1:50:42] cuz it will not be in vain. [music]
[1:50:45] All heads bowed.
[1:50:50] All heads bowed tonight.
[1:50:53] Just Just talk to him tonight.
[1:50:56] Just Just tell him how much you love
[1:50:57] him. [snorts] Think about where he's
[1:51:00] brought you from.
[1:51:03] Think about how he's blessed you. Maybe
[1:51:04] with a with a with a family, maybe with
[1:51:06] a be with a lovely home, a wife that
[1:51:10] loves you,
[1:51:12] whatever it may be. Just maybe it's just
[1:51:13] [music] a kid tonight. Maybe maybe you
[1:51:16] whatever situation you are, there
[1:51:18] there'll be something that you can thank
[1:51:19] God about.
[1:51:21] Just the breath in your body you have
[1:51:23] tonight. You can go home tonight [music]
[1:51:24] to a warm home. No matter the size,
[1:51:29] think about it just for a minute. You
[1:51:31] get to walk out to a car and put your
[1:51:33] heater on. Maybe you got heated seats.
[1:51:36] I'm telling you, church, we live in
[1:51:38] luxury. We have all the luxuries of this
[1:51:41] world. But don't forget Jesus.
[1:51:45] Don't forget the one.
[1:51:47] Even brother Brandham had to have Jesus.
[1:51:50] We all had to have Jesus. We've all have
[1:51:53] to have the one innocent one tonight.
[1:51:56] And it will not be in vain tonight.
[1:52:00] Whatever you have need of, we'll pray
[1:52:02] with you. Whatever it is,
[1:52:06] you lift your hands up. Pray. Pray how
[1:52:08] you want to pray. Just speak to him for
[1:52:11] a few minutes.
[1:52:16] Oh, as they sing a song tonight, you
[1:52:19] worship him however you feel.
[1:52:24] [music] is real for I can feel you in my
[1:52:29] soul.
[1:52:33] My God.
[1:52:35] [music]
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, worship him tonight.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; I may not know
[1:52:41] [singing] there are some places
[1:52:45] I
[1:52:47] can go. [music]
[1:52:51] But I am [singing] sure. Oh, come on.
[1:52:54] I'm sure it's one thing.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; It's one [music] thing.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise him tonight.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; My God is real for I can feel him in my
[1:53:05] [singing] soul. Let's stand. Let's sing
[1:53:07] it.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; My God is [music] real.
[1:53:12] He's real in my soul.
[1:53:16] My God is real. For he has washed and he
[1:53:21] made me whole. Oh,
[1:53:25] his love for [music and singing] me.
[1:53:29] It's like gold.
[1:53:32] [music]
[1:53:33] My God is real. For I can't feel him
[1:53:38] [singing] in my soul.
[1:53:42] Some [music] f me down.
[1:53:46] Some folks [singing] may score
[1:53:51] [music]
[1:53:53] tonight and leave me alone. [music]
[1:53:59] But
[1:54:01] as for me, [music] I'll take God's
[1:54:07] for God is real. [music]
[1:54:10] For I can't feel him in my heart. Oh
[1:54:14] yes. [music]
[1:54:15] My God is real.
[1:54:19] [singing] He's real in my soul.
[1:54:24] My God [music] is real. For I watched
[1:54:28] and made me [singing] whole. Oh yes, his
[1:54:32] love for me [music]
[1:54:36] is like
[1:54:40] my God is real. [music]
[1:54:43] I can't [singing] feel. God bless you,
[1:54:45] buddy. Love you, buddy. Amen.
[1:54:48] Well, I cannot tell. Oh yes. Just
[1:54:53] [singing and music] how you f
[1:54:57] when Jesus come
[1:55:02] away. Yes.
[1:55:05] But since that day,
[1:55:09] oh, since [music] that hour,
[1:55:13] God has been [singing] real. For I can
[1:55:16] feel his holy power. [music]
[1:55:21] My God is real. Oh yes, he's
[1:55:25] [music and singing] real in my soul.
[1:55:29] My God is [music and singing] real. For
[1:55:32] he has washed and he made me whole.
[1:55:37] His love for me [singing]
[1:55:41] is like pure gold.
[1:55:45] My God is real for you
[1:55:50] in my singing sing that last verse
[1:55:52] again. But I cannot tell
[1:55:57] just how you fell
[1:56:01] when Jesus [music]
[1:56:04] your sin
[1:56:06] [singing] away.
[1:56:09] But since that [music] day, oh yes,
[1:56:13] well, since that hour,
[1:56:17] God has been real. [singing and music]
[1:56:19] I can feel his holy power.
[1:56:24] My God is real. [music]
[1:56:28] He's real in my soul.
[1:56:32] [music]
[1:56:32] My God is real. For he has washed and he
[1:56:37] [singing] made me whole.
[1:56:40] His love for me. Yes. It's like gold.
[1:56:46] [singing and music]
[1:56:48] My God is real for I can feel him in my
[1:56:53] [music] soul.
[1:56:57] Amen.
[1:56:59] Amen.
[1:57:01] Amen.
[1:57:03] Amen. How many remembers how you felt
[1:57:05] that night? I felt like Muhammad Ali. I
[1:57:09] was fast as a butterfly.
[1:57:11] The whole world had lifted off my
[1:57:13] shoulders. I was 18 years old and I
[1:57:16] finally after running and the road I
[1:57:19] come to I couldn't run no more. He come
[1:57:22] and he made me whole.
[1:57:26] People told me they said I'd be in
[1:57:28] prison before I was 20.
