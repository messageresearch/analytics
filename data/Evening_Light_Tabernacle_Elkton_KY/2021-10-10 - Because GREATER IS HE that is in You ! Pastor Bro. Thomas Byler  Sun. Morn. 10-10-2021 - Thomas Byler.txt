TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you so hmm uh [Music] you uh you um so oh foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign so so oh [Music] [Music] foreign um so so [Music] [Music] well morning brothers and sisters uh there's not going to be any sunday school this morning if you all stand with me please and whatever your request thought of this morning uh you know we all serve all knowing god he knows where each one of you are at this morning where i'm at this morning so whatever that need is god knows it and yeah i was reading the devotional this morning were mom a couple of days ahead where brother branham was talking about how we pray you know the most important thing about anything you do when you're praying is you just gotta surrender yourself and surrender your will it's not having a bucket list of things you need it's just surrendering and letting god have his way in his will in your life and i'll just open with a prayer lord god we just come to this house again lord one more time lord to give you the praise and the worship you're worthy of lord we just desire to see you have your will in our hearts and lives today lord praying and believing the lord that you'll have full control over this service lord from the preaching all the way down the singing whatever said or done lord will be done to glorify you lord speak to our hearts this day lord come and have your way in our hearts we so desire to see you lord in this day that we live lord we truly need you lord we just invite you into this assembly lord god we just pray that you'll come and have your way again in thy name we pray amen if you return with me to the 12th chapter of proverbs i couldn't quite remember where troy left off last time i did this in the 119th psalm but we're going to read this these first 12 verses in the 12th chapter i've said before you know that when you take something like proverbs and you read proverbs you see solomon's wisdom you know 3 500 years ago and you read it today and you see that same wisdom is just as much applicable for the things we do in life today as it was three thousand years ago and i'll start with the first verse whosoever loveth instruction loveth knowledge but he that hateth through proof is brutish a man shall not be established by wickedness but the root of the righteousness shall not be moved the thoughts of the righteous are right but the councils of the wicked are deceit the wicked are overthrown and are not but the house of the righteous shall stand and he that is despised and hath a servant is better than he that honored himself and of bread he that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with the bread but he that follow with vain persons is void of understanding the wicked desire the net of evil men but the root of the righteous yielded fruit you know the one thing i don't it can all be seeded as brother dave it comes up i'm not teaching sunday school but that one scripture in there you know says a righteous man considereth the needs of his animals so whether you're human or animal god expresses us to treat everything with love and kindness love the lord with all of your heart this morning and it's good to see each and every one out and we have a pretty empty house this morning and brother stephen he's having to work this morning and then the rest of them are gone on fall break so it's good to have you here this morning and i had text brother steve avery this morning and he said well i'll just read you what he said you know me i usually get things messed up said good sunday morning to you as well god bless you brother dave he calls me dave he's one of the few i let do that i always tell everybody my name is david that's what they named me but anyways he said may god bless your church service i miss everyone at the church special group at the evening light tabernacle now i thought well i'm glad that we all made that kind of impression on our brother that he misses us and we miss him too but you know one of these days and but joe made a comment back there he said when he come in this morning and he said you know he said how will it be on that day when we're over there and we don't have any pain you know there's no old age no pain it's just kind of hard for us to imagine and he said you got something to smile about every day you know the world we live in sometimes it's not always there's not a lot to smile about but you know if you have jesus christ in your heart honestly even though we have sickness pains and aches i still believe as a as the bride of jesus christ we have something to smile about this morning i believe that with all my heart this morning and uh i'd like to sing that little course if we could this morning lord i lift your name on high and and also i uh i lost a ink pen it's brown and it has wade's cars on

this morning amen appreciate that very much amen god bless you this morning and pray the song service been a blessing to your hearts this morning and and just looking forward to what god has for us by the way of the word this morning and you know i i was praying this morning and i was thinking and something brother brad had said a few weeks ago it's been a while back he said you know we go to special meetings and i said lord help us all to come with that mentality this morning that we're coming we want something we're hungry this morning we're special it's just not the same thing but i said lord let me be that way let it be in me this morning and i got to pray and i said lord help me and you know we we just want to do what's pleasing to the lord this morning and create an atmosphere that he's pleased with this morning that's my heart's desire amen god bless you let's stand this morning and i pray that the lord will just speak to your heart as brother thomas comes and speaks the word let's sing that lol course this morning fill my cup as brother thomas comes this morning amen is that your desire this morning he'll fill your cup oh fill my cup lord it up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] up and make me amen good morning good to be back in the house of the lord good to see everybody out this morning amen god is good isn't he amen so we're just appreciate beautiful beautiful day thank you musicians thank you better david amen just each one amen so we're certainly enjoying the beautiful fall weather amen i don't know if we'll get a chance to i think with a john maybe we'll just keep watching the weather if next saturday we'll shoot for next saturday try to sew this grass out here all right we'll try for next saturday it's too wet now and if it rains much more we might not be able to but we'll try to get everything together so all you young men put that on your schedule if you would amen and we'll just see if we can't make it happen we'll keep you posted okay but we do need to get it done and the sooner the better amen amen can't think of anything else so let's just bow our hands kind heavenly father we come before you again lord thankful to be here to have gathered in your name with your believers lord jesus to be able to open your word father and ask you father just to give us the interpretation of it and to for you to speak the things that you once said lord jesus lord for each one to hear just the way that they should hear lord and father that we might go from here a better people than what we've come we ask both for the people that are here and in the radio land we ask god that you bless each and every one lord with a closer walk with you and lord as we've tried to minister that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak to the people father we ask god that it would be the thing and the message that you want this morning for us lord we just glorify you and praise you for all your goodness we ask these blessings in jesus name amen and amen amen enjoyed the message wednesday amen i think brother branham brother brother ben did good amen and so praise the lord always appreciate having ministers to help amen pray for brother brad he's going to take wednesday night for me so he may always appreciate his ministry amen for sure and so uh maybe before i wanted to just say a couple words maybe before i get started um you know brother ben he mentioned about uh sometimes you sit there and you as a minister anyway you think about the preacher what he's saying and and we as a minister you think of other scriptures and things that go along with what he's saying you know and he kept talking about he and he said you know if you have any victory if you're going to have victory and overcome it's going to be because of what you what comes out of your mouth right i thought well where would be a scripture for that you know i know that jesus used the word any time any place he used the word right and he got his victory that way but there's also i thought of another one over in revelation where it says and uh and this was not read in chapter 12 of revelations verse 11 i believe it says when accuser is cast down which accuses us day and night before god he says but they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony i said that's right you know amen and so also he talks about amen how that he mentioned brother branham saying something in the uh church age book i believe it is how that a fully surrendered person amen um uh to god is omnipotent all-powerful it's quite a mouthful it's for us human beings isn't it amen but i thought about the scripture he says you know i think i'm going to read it this morning where the bible says uh that it says that and if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed nothing shall be impossible with you amen i thought that's right you know a minute how many knows you can sit there and you always when i call it being optimistic always uh you know believe what the preacher is saying amen now if he says something wrong of course you can't and have can't have confidence but being optimistic about preaching is a whole lot better being pessimistic a lot of time we all know that you can sit there and be pessimistic well over here it says this or over here it says that you'll get a lot out of service that way amen so praise the lord but we just enjoy that god bless you if you will turn your bibles this morning to uh first john i believe it is first john and this morning uh service is going to be a center just howard's worshiping him amen starts worshiping him amen and i like the special of a song i know a man who can amen aren't you glad that you know a man who can amen so certainly the songs went along with what we were going to speak about first john 4 and verse 4. amen and this is certainly going to be and that and i a all right and first john 4 and 4 year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world may god had his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated i was working this week and just doing things and meditating on the lord and uh you know and it just began to come to me and the thought came to me uh of all the great things that god has done amen the powerful things that god has done amen all down through history all down through time and it made me think ask this question is there anything too hard for god and i believe brother brandon met him might have preached the message that way is there anything too hard for god amen i mean when you look at what what god can do and then i think brother brad mentioned i even forget already but something that would come out of the uh the lake against michigan or whatever i'd forget what it was but it took over the world amen and heard brother i'm saying yesterday and he that is in you talking about how that god could create so many billions of flies or fleas or he could destroy the world anyway that he wanted to he is that great amen and so there's nothing impossible with god isn't that right and so but my title this morning's just going to be and i'm going to bring in a lot of the is anything too hard for god but i want to title it because greater is he that is in you amen than he that is in the world amen and you know i mean you you can look at these couple of different ways but we realize that one way that i kind of look at this is that greater is the one that's on the inside of me than me right he's so much greater than the person that's in the world one place that says you are in the world but you're not of the world right so we're in the world and you know if we don't have him well we're pretty certain certainly limited to what we can do so we're going to take different examples different stories perhaps this morning of uh of what's happened in people when god was not only in them but we want to start with when he is with them amen amen then we want to talk about how that uh you know it's it's kind of a uh and we'll find it in saint john the tenth round the tenth chapter i believe it where it talks about the vine and the vine here the branches and so forth you know if any man abide not in me so you can you can get away from god how many believes that you can get away from god god doesn't say that he's going to get away from you but he does say you can get away from him amen and so there's a lot of stories we'll take with the help of the lord at least a few of them of people who got away from god amen and how that then of course they were no longer overcomers i mean those you cannot be an overcomer without him amen so praise god uh greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world what a mighty god that we serve let's first talk about the old testament i'm going to go way back amen and we find how that you know in the old testament for the most part god was with them right he was with them not necessarily in them but with them right a lot of times the holy spirit or god's spirit the bible says would come on samson it would come on david it would come on this one it would come on that one right here that holy ghost i mean god would come down on him and anoint him just like moses his full face shone that's how much of god that was on him you know but there is still an element way down in the soul amen that wasn't changed yet that's why david was a man after god's own heart but without a conversion he still had that carnal nature that he simply could not overcome amen and so but you know god was with him and as long as god even having god with them makes them all-powerful in joshua i like this when uh in the first chapter of joshua god after the death of moses the servant of the lord came it came to pass the lord spake unto joshua the son of none moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now arise and go over this jordan now and all this people unto the land which i will give them even to the children of israel and every place that the soul of your feet shall tread that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness of this lebanon even unto the great river the great river euphrates and all the land of the hittites and to the great sea towers the going down of the sun shall be your coast now notice here he says this and there shall not any man be able to stand before thee amen now notice what our scripture says our scripture said ye have overcome them now who is them anybody that isn't with god or that god isn't with anybody that is against you you will overcome as long as you have him well i'm here to tell you this morning if we get anything out of this service it's going to be that we learned the importance of having him on board now oh my so he says any man no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee oh my aren't you glad for that aren't you glad that you and i have a promise that i will never leave you nor forsake you even to the end of the world i mean it means every child of god every born-again person has that promise that god promised that i will be with amen and that's what we're all so happy about that's what makes life life you know i came to have life not more abundantly because i live all if you've got a m you aren't even living this morning is about bragging about jesus there's a woman when come came up the brother bam says you know i really enjoyed your message but you just bragged too much on jesus he was just a prophet or you know another good man or whatever you know and he was you know he wasn't divine or whatever you brag too much i believe was she said that the only fault that i have with you what you're saying in your ministry is that you brag too much about jesus i was pretty happy you know imagine you did a little jig huh say about praise speak to god hallelujah if that's all you can find fault with and i am pretty happy wouldn't you be if that's the only fault somebody could find was that you brag too much about jesus amen i'll be glad to announce that i don't just brag about him i adore him i love him and not only that i plumb worship the man are you asked god plump worship him amen right because all before him and worshipped him and he said no that belongs to god no he accepted the worship because they said my lord and my god that's what he called him because that's what he was amen so we're going to brag on jesus amen because he's the only one worth bragging about and then he goes on to talk about the law not departing out of the mouth and so forth verse nine i have not i commanded thee be thou strong strong and of good courage be not afraid need to be dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee with me whether so ever thou goest oh i love to tell the old stories don't you amen whenever moses met god on the back side of the desert right when he was introduced to him his life was pretty bland right it was pretty plain living on the backside of the desert serving her his wife's uh father and so forth and working there and and doing all that watching the sheep until god finally said moses i want you to come up to this mountain i want to talk with you right from that point on his life completely changed and when he met that pillar of fire when he met god oh my aren't you glad you met god you met that pillar of fire that's something that made a change folks if that don't happen in your life all you ever do is just come to church and hear a bunch of words it's just a bunch of empty words just you know doesn't mean much at all but you meet him it makes all the difference in the world you'll never be the same never a testimony that you'll never be the same i belong i met that pillar fire when i was 20 years old hello that's a long time ago i've never never been the same why because he did something moses met him and then he began to say you know i want you to go down there and i want you to deliver my people and what did moses say i am insufficient i can't do it i i i can't do it folks i want you to know when you get to that place and you realize you can't do it but god says don't you worry i'm gonna be with you didn't he say i'm gonna be with you moses you ain't going down there alone how are they gonna know that you know that i'm son of god he says what do you got in your hand huh take this stick he had a stick in his hand calling the staff and then he says you know about this you're going to deliver israel and i just take this dick and so forth and go down that you your stick and me and we're going to do the job my man knows i ain't no job too big for god amen amen all right brother dave i think you might saw all right i love you amen but amen praise the lord uh but anyway listen so amen there he was and he said i can't do it but i know that he can and he had to get that over to to moses look i'm with you we're a majority let me ask you something well let me tell you something you know where you would be if it wasn't for god controlling and being in your life you would be like samson after he disobeyed god let me know because samson is an example of leaving god i didn't leave him samson was the one that disobeyed he's the one to cut his hair give away secret and that right and because of it he was down there at the mill grinding going around and around with his eyes out miserable being mocked oh they didn't figure drums out no they wanted him to hear them laughing at him and their god and he's god he was a complete mockery he was in complete prison how many knows that's why we wouldn't be if it wasn't for god in our life that's right a terrible place but moses went down and all he did was follow christ he was an example of somebody that was completely surrendered to god isn't that right come on folks are you with me completely surrendered to god so there was nothing impossible with him with god nothing is impossible aren't you glad for that man i'm here to tell you we truly should be the happiest people on the face of the earth amen don't you just love him amen in matthew 17 and 20 it says it this way and jesus says unto them well they go to 19. then came his disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out and jesus says unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if you have faith as the greatness of a mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hands and move yonder and young in the out to younger place and it shall remove for and nothing shall be impossible unto you all right maybe we've said it a hundred times maybe preachers have said it 100 times but i want to say it one more time and maybe in just a little bit different ways so put this in your hard drive are you ready remember this when you face impossible odds impossible things in your life things that look like it could never be fixed it could be you can't get over it you can't get under you can't get around it and it it may be completely different unlike anything you've ever seen maybe it's not a mountain being removed maybe it's a tumor maybe it's cancer maybe it's whatever it is remember this no matter what it is if you have him with you greater is he that is in you than he is in the world there is nothing that you can't conquer how he believes that no matter how big it is no matter how hard the problem as long as he is there it's not you doing it most of our problem is right the battle that we face is conquering ourself that's the giant many times is completely being able to surrender to almighty god and let him do it i like that think about it no matter what the problem i don't care if it's uh you know you know look at what god had moses to do yet perhaps him to do things and that hadn't been done before call flies call for fleas call for frogs call for the water to be turned into blood i mean he didn't care god didn't care what it took he was going to get the job done god will not fail if you are in the line of duty god will not fail and folks i want you to know something if you are continuously failing remember that ain't god [Music] no it's not god if you're always failing if you're never having the victory if you're achieving your purpose it's not god that's something that you're doing you have gotten yourself into it judge your life of whether it is a life a victory or a life of defeat that's pretty good it don't matter what it is folks i've it's just you know it's something the lord's showing me fresh amen because god he never is defeated you think pharaoh you did the story the story would be completely different no the israelites they stayed captives and god just forgot about he couldn't do it huh didn't even even moses used that against god one time right when god was ready to destroy them all said just separate yourself i'll destroy a whole bunch and moses says no don't do that because then the heathens will say that he wasn't able to take him on huh and so god says i right but the story is how many believe god is more than able and the thing of it is if god is able to do anything if he is in you then you can conquer go through anything isn't that powerful greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world all right let's take a few of people who who didn't have god with him now we we all know are very very familiar with the message brother man preached on that people in this age these churches they're doing god a service without it being his will god isn't with them no you wouldn't have homosexuals you wouldn't have women cutting their hair and wearing makeup looking like prostitutes walking in their doors if god was with him huh no no no no listen so there we find that people think that god is with him sometimes when he's not let's just i wanted to take samson because samson was an example that god was at one time with him right and with god with him it didn't matter oh my sometimes we think we have so little to work with here well you know if i you know if i could have a million dollars i could be a missionary and i could do missionary work if i was a great preacher i could do this or if i you know no no no if you just have god with you it doesn't matter if all you have is in your hand is a jawbone of a meal you can conquer everything that's in front of you it doesn't matter what you have you have to have very little promise god is in it just like moses that stick that's all he really really really needed now stretch forth thy sap amen into the red sea and it'll part right it wasn't the stick coming it wasn't this thick it wasn't moses it was god in moses oh my praise be to god so samson we realized that he got away from god he got away from god and all of a sudden it was defeat after defeat after defeat how many know any when everything starts going wrong i begin to say lord did i do something wrong somewhere how many's with me if this goes wrong and that goes wrong and this goes wrong and that what if i miss it here you know oh my and i we realize god allows you to go through trials but one thing's for sure if you're in his will god will take you out the other side he'll bring out the other side folks brother john all of us i would be a complete wreck beside the road i'd be somewhere who knows where if it wasn't for god's hand on my life you would be too we'd be complete wrecks if it wasn't for god's and on our lives to take us through the trials that we go those hard times those emotional times that we have those those oh my those great trials that god allows to come our way amen but boy i'll tell you all right we real quick gravity that is in you now if he is not in you let's talk about that for a minute you do your own thing you have a plan like let's go with another how about nathan cora how about korra or was it dayton remember and he says moses you take too much upon yourself and he did something in himself right man we're religious too we're only two [Music] now was god with him no god was not with him and what he ended up he ended up getting his whole family swallowed up in the earth everybody around him that took sides with him destroyed that wasn't god that was just him getting away from the god or god ordained way same way with samson he disobeyed god and i want you to know something you can't really have how many knows you can't have confidence towards god if you're doing things that is contrary to his word can't disobey god and expect god to just keep on blessing you no we got to be obama's we got to be obedient god demands obedience samson was an obedient and what look when god left him boy he became a complete uh calamity he was terrible things that went with him amen same way with nathan he was on the road he was riding with the group he was praising the lord with miriam and allah oh man until he left god amen and did his own thing that's what happens amen when you do your own thing remember israel i believe it was ahab and that wanted to go up and take a certain portion of land and they consulted micah micah says go on up but i seen israel scattered like sheep having no shepherd and so forth they went up there without the lord even though there are gods people in the land belong to them but they did something that the lord didn't tell them to do and god was not with them and they got killed didn't they they got scattered because they did something did something that the lord wasn't with folks i want you to know right now don't you leave the lord don't leave the lord otherwise calamity will strike things will go terribly wrong you won't have any victories no matter what you do it'll be defeat after defeat after defeat after defeat think of all the times that israel got away from god and then the enemies would come and take him captive amen my [Applause] now that was those those those times back there with samson with israel with nathan and so forth in the new testament it was the seven sons of siva that we can take as an example of he wasn't with them they were copycats they thought they could just not have down in here what paul had and what jesus had so when they went to casting out those devils they says we know who paul is because we know who's with them i mean it wasn't just paul it was who was with paul and they knew jesus well right they know the holy ghost but these guys didn't have the holy ghost so they tried to impersonate to do something they did and god didn't even protect him did he jesus did not even protect him let me tell you something when you're in the line of duty god protects you you have his protection that's why you don't have to fear anything don't be don't fear don't be dismayed for i am with you praise the lord how many believe that over in john the 14th chapter and verse 16 i'll start i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you amen how many please when jesus was there with them their clear distinction that he is now with them and shall be in you there is a world of difference there is a world of difference between him being with you and in you if he's here beside you sure he'll guard you he'll protect you he's with you but when he comes on here we know there has to be a work done before he ever makes his abode in your heart amen because man they knew him the disciples do it but they did not know the love of god even peter and them you know what to kill anybody that wait contrary to him and so forth god obviously and everything else but when he comes in here you have the same love you have the same feeling that god himself does because he is not just with you now but he is in you i don't believe we can ever over emphasize this enough no it's christ the mystery what was christ the mystery which was hid from other ages and so forth it's christ in you the hope of glory that's the great mystery christ in you so he says and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while when the world sees me no more but you see me because i live ye shall live also aren't you glad to live amen he lives you live and at that day you shall know that i am in my father you are in me and i am you praise be to god it brings us again to the true meaning of what our prophet taught us that is he says if you have the holy ghost on the inside of your heart when you're born again and when you have the holy ghost you have everything that you will ever need in this life's journey and what else thank you and in the world to come because how many of those a lot of us are dead are getting older we're getting older now we've got to realize and then the next decade hey there's perhaps amen you're going to have to face one of the biggest challenges of your whole life that's death itself you're gonna have to face death amen amen and you can do it unless you can do it with as long as he's in here it'll be all right how many believes it'll be all right amen because i tell you i've realized i believe we as christians need to know this for sure that all it is is stepping from this dimension into the other dimension amen it's taking your last breath here but it's not the end it's taking you first over there amen it's not as bad it's not bad amen not for a believer it isn't it's the most glorious thing for a believer but it's scary amen but still it'll be a challenge it's to check you out make sure whether you're right or not amen let me say something else this morning about about this i wanted to kind of do this at the end but i'm just going to go as it comes there is no rapture there is no rapture unless it is him in you you'll be left in the tribulation period to be punished to listen to the sounds of those nuclears i was laying in the bed thinking this morning i believe it was of those who missed the rapture and those who experienced those atomic bombs going off i had to think this i had to think probably you won't even die from that heat that's hotter than the sun you know how hot a nuclear bomb is i understand it's hotter in the sun it's very very hot but just uh what do you call that wave that comes yeah just that would probably kill you long before you ever felt the heat does that throw you so far right probably kill most of people unless you're in the building somewhere in the fire but folks you don't have to worry about that aren't you glad but there's no rapture unless he is in you now how many knows what brother braham talked about the token what is he it's when he has supreme control in here he said the literal life the song says like israel he says when i see the blood i will pass over you now it's not just the literal blood but it's the life that was in the blood which is him unless he is living his life out through you don't expect to go because it's the only thing that is accepted the only thing that god accepts is christ's life in you now he that hath not the spirit of god paul said is none of his you have to have the holy ghost in your soul not just your flesh and spirit but down in your soul you have to have him down here in order to take a rapture i mean please we have another big challenge this is the challenge i want to face brother irvin i want to challenge oh my and we can do it i mean there's nothing you can't do without him aren't you glad for that doesn't that make you happy to know that no matter young people listen if you've got him on board remember no matter what comes don't get irated don't fall don't go go crazy about no just surrender it to god say god i know you can handle this and then watch him handle it i'm here to tell you folks i am sorry to say this but i have seen way too many people try to make things happen themselves and bitterly failed because he was themselves committed to god say god you take care of it keep my dirty hands off of it sure as you get your dirty hands in it you are going to feel bitterly because god ain't going to be with you amen now where was i amen i was gonna read you something one night amen but that's right amen he's gotta be into him in the holy ghost the token his own life in you that's the only thing that's accepted where we have our trouble and where we have our defeats folks is where the prophet says you know we get too many of our own ways mixed up in it i mean at least we still got to get rid of our own ways still too many of thomas boiler's ways in i don't know where i was at i was going to go to the rapture the challenge second thessalonians amen oh my when i when i got to thinking about this hallelujah my i had to be a fit off there's nothing nothing too hard for god nothing too hard for you sometimes we think it is but it's not even close or very hard for god folks for for one of for one of his children one time that needed something he so to speak stop the universe he told the sun to stop the moon to stop huh everything stopped why because one of his children had a need nothing is too hard for god if he can stop the sun and the moon for somebody's need he can sure take care of your knee second thessalonians 4 we call this a funeral message but it's really a rapture message he just talks about those that are sleeping amen who are taking a nap but i would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep and that ye sorrow not death even as others which have no hope amen i don't know if i should but i i feel like i maybe be all right sister becky i remember when we buried your mom if i remember right you was up there with a shovel singing and praising god anyone yeah i remember that i was there he said i think burying your mom with a devil praising god hallelujah huh she don't have to sorrow like others who have no hope why because we believe that if we're of god that we know where they're at no we ain't got to be sad like others who have no hope we can rejoice and oh my they're in a better place amen concerning them which are asleep that you saw not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god then the dead in christ shall rise first [Music] now we know that when jesus rose from the dead that abraham and sarah were seen down in the city right for about 30 days or so people begin the scene they wouldn't visit the old city and people saw them and so forth that's why the prophet of god said when this red direction takes place know that you're going to see loved ones perhaps you'll see your loved ones we're gonna have church then huh can you imagine brother irvin if you saw ivan huh you say i'm an uh oh where'd he go just see him for a glimpse see our loved ones all of a sudden and then what what happens after that then we which are alive and remain right shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord [Music] folks if the prophet god said he really does not believe that he would die of old age before the lord comes back he'd be over 100 now thought that he would come in 1977 here we are in 2020 how late is it we can almost assuredly say we believe i'll say it like he did i don't believe i'll die of old age before he comes huh praise be to god that means you'll either be in the rapture or a tribulation period i don't believe i'm gonna be in the tribulation period why because i have seen god in my life way too much remember he says the world sees me no more but you're going to see me how are you going to see me because i'll be with you even in you doing things that you know you could never do you know that it's me working in your life amen one of the things that really one of the things that tells you if you're his is you go through all kinds but yet there's something down inside him hanging on to you and helping you to serve him no matter what you love him anyway you still love him you're still serving him amen he brings you through all these thoughts you see him and i just happen to believe that one of these days folks how many believes you have to have faith i have to believe we have to challenge so to speak to know that god is more than able to one of these days i believe it says paul said will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye well i'm not a psycho not a psychologist but a philosopher to know just what twinkling an eye is but my interpretation is something that happened pretty quick in a moment the twinkling of an eye just a little glimpse of something about your eye twinkles just a little light that shines like for a second it's gone just a twinkling of an eye just in a moment we'll feel a change sweep over huh it'll not be something that you can do hello but it'll be something god does in you i don't know about you but i believe that's a real faith challenge for a real believer to know that god's gonna change us in our very adams one time we're gonna be just like enoch the bible says and he was not for he had this testimony that he pleased god our testimony is that we please god and we have him on board we have him in our hearts letting him live out his life remember the token life the literal life reminds us nothing but the literal life of jesus christ living in you is the only thing that is accepted oh my aren't you thankful for that this is uh just worship the lord say thank you lord amen to know that he's on board no matter what comes no matter what goes he's on board because greater is he that is in you than he is that is in the world remember the laodicea church age let's talk about somebody else for just a minute over in revelations 11 revelations 3. we know in revelations 3 the last church age unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now notice behold i stand at the door was he with him no he was put outside wasn't he he wasn't with him anymore no he wasn't there anymore here's a church age that doesn't have him on the inside but has him on the outside what is their condition they say verse 17 thou sayest i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked that was their condition just as samson was a slave these people here in this church age because they didn't have him on the inside right they were wretched miserable poor blind and made naked and the bible says thou knowest not they didn't even have the mental capacity to know they were naked that they were miserable that they were poor they were blind they were wretched i'm here to tell you it'll be the group that comes up that says heaven we were rich in god we did we do all great kinds of unwonderful things huh they thought they were rich but they weren't he was actually outside they were doing their own thing [Music] amen god's not coming for people who do their own thing he's coming for those who are fulfilling doing his service that he wants none not the thirst that he doesn't want done miserable poor blind and naked no doubt every one of us knows what it's like that when you grieve the holy spirit how many was like you grieve the holy spirit and he takes it slight from you how many has ever have ever experienced that hey folks am i your preacher your pastor is saying both hands are up sure i've lost my emperor did all kinds of stuff that doesn't take a whole lot folks just lose your temper one time just remember this the holy ghost gone ah that's right you're gonna have to say i'm sorry before he comes back all right we all what happens i pray i never do i sometimes i think you know i've gotten over i i i don't but get in sometimes uh dog will jump up pet me and poke me in the eye you know you just something's gonna irritate you right but anyway but just that empty feeling and then you're like i don't like this it's horrible how many knows it's horrible to live without christ horrible and live without the holy ghost if you're ever going to overcome anything listen we overcome this leia we come over lukewarm as everything because of him that's in you that's the only reason you overcome because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you can grieve the holy spirit away how many believes that turn with me one more scripture i want to go to in john the 15th chapter i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit that's why i always preach that god is never satisfied with you no matter how good you are he's in the project and the job of making you a little better yet how many believes that he's always working on us he's always pruning always trying to get us to bear more fruit amen now notice now are clean through the words which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you amen as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abides in the vine our brother said the other day he says now you are the vine and i am the branches he said i was he was listening if they were really listening he says that's not how it is jesus is the main mind right we are the branches the vine don't bear any fruit the fruit comes off of the branches amen and that's what you and i are we are the branches that bears god's life no more can ye accept about you abide in me amen i am the vine and ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit how many please that what kind of fruit the fruit of the spirit brother how can you be so long suffering because greater is he that is in me that is in you that is in the world how can you love people that smite you on the cheek and do you wrong how can you never go telling everybody how much you hate them people huh because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world how can you love everybody makes me love everybody how can you have so much joy well greater is he that is in me than this guy that would want to get in the way are you with me this morning if you have joy it's because he's greater in you than you are of yourself if you love people if you have patience if you're kind if you channel if you're meek if you have faith if you have temperance those are all the fruit of the spirit it's all because he's greater than you are now how many this morning believes that that's what we all want is lord i want you to be greater than me you know because if i'm greater than you none of those things is going to happen i can't bear any fruit i can't have long suffering i can't be patient and all these things no because i'm greater than he is because he's not greater than i am but it's supposed to be the other way greater is he that is in you than he did is in the world the same bringeth forth much fruit all right he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do some things a little just a little bit no zero [Music] you can't live a little christian life at all you cannot be a christian you cannot produce anything unless you have me without me you can do nothing now put look at the world around you are they doing anything for god anything good no zero it's going the other way they're doing absolutely nothing the only body that can do anything is a christian that has christ in their life they're the only ones that can do anything for god and for good without him you're empty your void if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire we're talking about laodicea now hello he knows pentecost church of god baptist lutheran all of them every last one of them they're going to be cast into the lick of fire because they have left god and they are withered and they're going to be bound in bundles the bible says that the uh the tares are what they're bound in bundles right they all gather together under one head and that's the pope world council of churches they all gather together they're all being bundled together right because they're what withered get a preacher up there let me go up there and hear hear a preacher preach this bible the way that it's supposed to be preached they'll throw him out so fast he won't be there the next sunday preach on heaven the holy ghost and what the holy ghost really does oh they'll preach that oh yeah you've got to have the holy ghost but they don't tell you the holy ghost it's going to make you live right do right go take the paint off your face wear the right clothes huh that's right to quit cutting your hair all those things holy ghost we tell them that god sent a prophet in this generation that's what the holy ghost would do if god told the world i send you a prophet what in the world are we going to tell the world same thing god told the world behold i'll send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen that's what he'll do but if a man don't abide him he is withered [Music] oh my we all know what that feels like when the holy sees for just a little bit right but a child about how many knows a child of god does the same thing that others do there's only one difference the child of god back child of god repents amen that god forgives amen oh my sometimes we feel withered i'm sure i'd get a raising of hands this morning if i ask how many has ever felt like you were just withered like my i just don't feel spiritually alive at all anymore i feel so withered and it's a miserable feeling terrible to go a day an hour or a minute without the holy ghost are you with me not i don't want to go one minute without the holy ghost i don't want to go one minute without him i can't even walk without him holding my hand amen praise be to god my without him i could would be nothing without him i'd surely fail without him i would be drifting like a ship without a can do nothing without him now notice here cast them into the fire and they are burnt if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will hallelujah oh my what you will and it might be done unto you and it shall it's a contract word it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit i hope from this morning on that us here at night tabernacle will be able to be able to say in a greater way brother byler this is what god did for me boy i'll tell you what i just committed it to god and the judge i'll tell you what god did that for me he did this for me god is real i believe we need the greater testimony of that don't you each and every one of us should be able to have a testimony i ask god to do something and they do huh because we're all careful already right that we don't want to ask amiss huh now if you don't ask a miss and you ask according to god amen i can i can man i can just think of of things that i asked the lord to do and sure enough a couple months later i see it happening amen i know god is real don't you god is real and i want him to be greater than this guy right here as long as he is greater than this guy everything will be all right i'll overcome everything that comes my way as long as he isn't here all right let me finish up here that ye bear much fruit and so shall ye be my disciples as the father had loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love amen if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken now let's find out why in the world he told look at why he told us all this stuff these things have i spoken unto you that you my joy might remain in you and that your joy may be half full empty no smile a little smile no a big smile that your joy may be full how many please with the fullness of him comes the fullness of joy amen god bless you let's stand this morning how many appreciates the lord how many appreciates the holy spirit in this generation remember he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and i'll tell you right now we're at the end of the world and i'm glad of all the things i'm most glad that he's in us that he's with us aren't you glad that the holy spirit is still here because one of these days that holy spirit will be lifted and then everything in here will be completely black brother brahm says he seen this age what did it do completely black out after the rapture for the gentiles it is going to be completely dark no hope no joy no peace no any of that i mean let's bow our heads search your heart ask yourself if you truly are so surrendered to him that everything that comes your way you're overcoming he's overcoming through you i know we have our faults i know we have our failures i know we have the times that we get defeated and when we do we get right back up again and try again don't we that's right because we know that hey there's still just too much of me in there and i'm committing myself in a greater way i realize there's still too much of me and not enough of him how many wants more of him say lord jesus i'm raising my hand i want more of you more and more and more lord until i can say that it is not me there's nothing good about me i can't do a thing but he can do anything lord jesus we ask this morning as we raise our hands to you we ask god that you would help us lord to go farther to a death to ourselves in a greater way so that you can live so that you can have the preeminence in our life lord and so that we can realize that no matter how great many of different people experience different trials different tests different things that we have to overcome but lord man we all realize that if we have you on board and if you are the one that's in us there is nothing too great for you there is nothing that you can't do lord we ask god that you would be the leader in the guide in our lives lord in a greater way after this morning realizing lord jesus that father we just want to completely worship you in our lives every day of our life lord on monday tuesday wednesday no matter where we are on our jobs in our homes no matter what we're doing lord always have you before us we ask god that you would live your life out through us and have us ready for that translation lord we believe it won't be long lord jesus and you're going to come down father and sweep over we're going to have a changing of the body lord jesus we're going to see our loved ones we believe it with all of our god because you have not brought us this far to leave us we believe god that you're doing a work in our lives and we thank you for it we ask your continued leadership and guidance forgive us lord jesus this morning where there's still too much of us sometimes we're greater than you are and that's when we fail it's when we're too great yet lord we want you to be the great one lord we want you to be greater than what we are in every aspect of our life in jesus name amen and amen god bless you brother david
