[Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] brother Joe will open us in prayer this morning foreign foreign every day I'm going to look around here they shouldn't be doing for you whatever you think the Lord you show me how to fix it let's get on your knees and pray for the person or that's what Real Love Is Lord I pray this morning download another different points is going through this Jesus they have ever made in this morning or that we can open our hearts and our ears and our eyes for whatever we're having together Lord we lay here we will never be the same Lord I'm concerned to say I feel like I'm the most need the next one you want to see everything around us Lord the world has fallen apart it is not something of the future the Lord I pray that you have made one of us this morning thank you for the mercy of Grace that you've had committed foreign this morning with this place in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen children can be dismissed for Sunday School we're just going the Psalms here good prayer brother Joe it's all we needed yeah sure is easy to fix everybody else's problems but it's not really it's always easy to fix our own problems I can lose weight for everybody else and go on a diet and help them do that but it's hard to go on a diet yourself and do the same thing but it's easy to give advice but a lot harder to walk through the things that we have to go through sometimes uh Psalms one we're gonna go to Psalms one for our scripture reading just a real short Psalms blessed is the man that walketh not in the console of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of of Sinners nor siddeth in the seedeth scornful and he shall be like a tree that is planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish God bless you may be seated we'll be doing some scripture reading a little bit of scripture reading here got a couple quotes here if I can get them all together here can't go wrong with reading the scriptures so sometimes that's what I got to try to stick with so let's see here if we'll go to uh you can go with me if you want to and if you don't have to if you don't want to but Zechariah 14. verse 6. and seven uh Zechariah 14 6 and 7 and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall be that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that that in the heat at the evening time there shall be light it showed me like and uh that's where I believe we are right now actually the Rems called into dismal Dave and uh this is from let's see here the great coming revival and outpouring of the Holy Ghost were the rims and then through this time did you ever see a day that was dark and drizzle in a dismal-like day that's the thing that we've lived through well they got enough light that they can see that Jesus was the Christ and they ought to accept and as Savior but all of his great powers and things have been hid from them they can't see it all through the day they said the days of Miracles has passed all them things they had on Pentecost that ceased and that's when the Sun was shining back there in the east but geographically and that's where we are today uh that's one of the things I was gonna uh but we should be so thankful that we do have eyes that can see in yours that can hear because most of the world and most of the denominational people they they can't see it you can you can show it to them right to their face you can take them back to the scriptures and show it to them over and over and over again and they'll get out of it this way and they'll get out of it that way they'll get out of it whichever way they can get out of it because they can't see it but thank you Lord for letting me be able to see what I can see and hear what I can hear because once you do see and hear you can't unsee it so once you do have a revelation of what God's done in this age and what he's doing in this age you cannot unsee it but just the same way unless God would open their eyes and open their ears they cannot see it but geographically speaking brother Brown says watch the sun is done crossed over now by human theology by Church organization by the nominations and so forth it's dark in these things from the Christian's eyes that's right it's dark and Divine Healing let's start in the power of God it's darkened all the gifts they've applied it back there where the Sun was shining here it is but the prophet said it shall be light in the evening time the sun rises in the East it sets in the west when we're the Western People Western Hemisphere here we're in the west the Western people as it Rose Over Yonder in the beginning and was showed that the same Holy Spirit the fell on the day of Pentecost and things that it accompanied in the church there the very things that happened back there in the uh in the last days in the last 20 or 30 years has felt here on the western world and showing the same signs here that it did over there it'll be light in the evening time he says the clouds broke back denominations are broke Hallelujah and the people has entered into the baptism of the holy spirit with signs and wonders just like they had in the beginning it'll be light in the evening time and remember it was the evening time when the bride was chosen Rebecca was taken in the evening time it was the evening time that she met Isaac he was out in the field it's the evening time our general Gentile Revival is coming is ending pretty soon the Jews are going to take the Revival as soon as they can see the power of God manifesting and receiving the Holy Ghost they'll take the gospel or Gentile days are ending get into the kingdom while you have a chance to get into the kingdom he says I'm gonna Revive on outpouring of the Holy Spirit and that's so true that's exactly where we're standing today like brother and brother Joe's prayer the world is crumbling and whoever's supposed to be in charge they're they're in on vacation or something they're they're not making good choices so the world is crumbling and it seems to be crumbling faster and decisions that people are supposed should be making they're making the opposite of those decisions so it's unraveling and it's unraveling fast uh I had some more scriptures here I was just uh listening to different things and um well let's go over here once let's go to Matthew let's go to Matthew 24. no Jesus is in here telling his disciples what it's what will kind of be like here foreign the fourth verse Maybe in Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many you should hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass the end this did not yet Nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be famines pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these things are the beginning of Sorrows then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted as you kill you they shall you should be hated of all Nations for our name's sake and then shall many have be offended and shall betray one another shall he and shall hit one another many false prophets shall rise they shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold while iniquities abounding in the love of the love is definitely waxing cold in the world but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all the nations and then shall the End come and uh yeah if you turn well you know I don't know but if you turn on your phone basically or any any device that um has the news on it there's killings every day murders every day so a lot of times mass shootings there's Wars or rumors of wars um I was listening uh to an interview and uh yeah the the systems that are in place we don't know how fast of unravel we don't quite know where we are and we do we can see say one thing we better be looking up because the world is coming apart at the seams nobody seems to have uh you know a clue of what to do about it but uh basically that's uh I was listening to this interview and they said uh the the bombs that were dropped in Nagasaki Japan they were they said the bombs that we have now the nuclear weapons and stuff they said times what was dropped in Nagasaki Japan which was so hot it melted granite and people are still having deformities from what was dropped back then at the end of the last World War and they said multiply that times 500 they said so once things start going bad which they are going heading that direction but basically it it wouldn't take long for the destruction on the whole world and uh as Brother David oftentimes sings all our hope and all our hope should be in Jesus we know we don't have we get kind of well we do get distracted I know I get distracted with things we got things that we have to do we always got so many obligations it seems like keeps us so busy but I guess uh you know the main focus and what we should be focusing on especially because I believe it is winding down time is Jesus beginning getting ourselves ready to leave this world which has nothing left for us but uh getting ourselves ready to leave this world and what did Jesus say in there he said I believe you sit in there as you see these things approaching look up for your Redemption draweth nigh and that's all we want to do that's what we're that's what we come into the house of the Lord this morning to do to listen to the word to search ourselves and I know I know we make mistakes I know the Devil beats us up over these you know different things that we make mistakes over but the one thing that we got to do is if we get knocked down if we get kicked while we're down just roll over and do your best get back up you might have to crawl for a while but whatever you have to do keep going in the right direction the devil is going around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may destroy and uh we don't want to be left on the outside of that arc when when the rain starts raining so we want to get ourselves ready we want to be ready so uh that's pretty much all I got this morning brother David all your heart this morning I thought that as he mentioned that little course that we sang so many times oh my hope is in Jesus I thought you know Lord where could I go this morning where could we go [Music] I don't know but I'm so glad this morning [Music] that all my hope is in him let's stand and sing that this morning oh My Hope Is In Jesus yes [Music] oh my God my yes we're days gone and all my sins [Music] once again this morning if we could oh oh my God [Music] thank God [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen are you thankful they've been washed by the blood this morning and you know the the devil you need to sing that song to him when he comes telling you what all you've

picks you up and you just feel like nothing ever was wrong because he just picks you up out of that trial or test whatever you want to call it that she was Aaron and you know you might need me and you might call me and I might not answer but if you call them heavenly father he's always there to answer isn't he hey man he's a he's a constant friend amen loving this morning and amen and I just appreciate the Lord this morning and appreciate his goodness and just thought what an opportunity to come in the house of the Lord this morning and I follow the things that's been said this morning

give him some very powerful powerful services and he said they'd had 30 come to the Lord and thought my what an awesome thing you know and I just pray that God just continue to speak to our hearts and you know one of these days that last one's going to come in and we're going to get to go home amen and you know we sing We Sing a lot of wonderful songs and I thought this morning as I was praying and getting songs and I thought you know Lord it's so good but what do you want us to sing what do you want done this morning that you might get the glory and honor this morning and this song Come On My Heart this morning and amen and I I know we sing it sometimes a lot but I'm thankful for the victory this morning aren't you amen and the only Victory I know is in Christ Jesus because in David Wade

and that you could be touched by we certainly serve a mighty God this morning and thankful to be in the house of the Lord and we if you want to grab your Bibles we will get right into the word here in just a second I guess uh I need to put out a little disclaimer uh brother Biola preached on being content on the last service we had and and uh all a week or so two weeks I've been preaching I'm not being content or thinking I'm preaching on not being content so I'm not here to contradict what he said or what he's what he was going and I hope you understand the difference in the two contexts of where he was at and where I'm going uh but uh I think if we could open our hearts this morning and and just receive what God would have in store for us I think God wants wants us a little closer this morning and I think God wants us to live a little closer to him this morning you know we love the encouraging messages and man do I love to preach him I love to preach inspiration encouragement and trying to lift others up and I love to see people succeed and be successful but you know when it all boils down to it if we're not successful at the end if our lives are not lining up with where the word is we've it's all it's all vanity so we have to be able to line up to the word in order to be truly successful at the end of our road and that's where I want to be so when I preach today I'm preaching to you I'm preaching to my to myself I'm preaching to my wife I'm preaching to my children to everyone I want us to be ready and if I put a title on this this morning I'm going to title this check yourself before you wreck yourself we'll turn to Isaiah chapter 6. very one of my favorite scriptures but I've I don't think I've ever ever preached on this um but I love I love this scripture here Isaiah chapter 6. say Amen when you get there okay in the year this is Isaiah speaking here in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting up on the throne high and lift Ed up and his Trump the seraphim s foreign I'm kind of I've always had an intriguement I guess angels and and you know you see different things and I kind of chuckle and it just so the response of some people and I don't mean to say this lightly but some people I think understand exactly what they're looking for and angels and cherubims and seraphims and you know you see people that uh you'll see it on car windows and so and so passed away and they received their wings and that's not the way it works with you're either a human or you're an angel you don't receive Wings when you die and go on cemetery is a lot you see the little chubby face baby-faced angel with wings that's far from what a true chariable Miss and the seraphim and when you read this you see and I think this tells us in this next scripture it tells us the magnificence of of what what uh Isaiah sees in this vision and if you think about every time in the Bible that an angel step forward or appeared or showed himself and I think even when uh brother Billy Paul was seeing the angel they were warned don't be afraid don't be afraid so there's a magnificence about these angels and these seraphims and these cherubims that are Divine beings if you have to be told don't be afraid okay so let's go on with our text here and each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face with Swain he covered his feet with Twain he did fly and one cry to another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory Watch What Happens and the post of the door moved at the voice the very doorpost shook when these voices were crying out holy holy holy as Isaiah sees it in the scripture or in the vision here and they moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke watch what happens to Isaiah then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar and he laid it up on my mouth and said Lo this has touched the this has touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away thy sins are purged wow how many can say this morning I I could use an angel of God to come down and touch my lips what was me I could use an angel to come down and touch my lips with a hot coal of fire to burn out anything in my life that's contrary to the word of God amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we just want to tell you this morning we love you we appreciate you Lord Lord I just come before you personally asking that I might decrease that you would increase that the words that will be spoken today would reach down and prick our hearts as you go through the congregation weaving through the congregation Lord this is not the kind of services that we that we uh pull forward that we ask that we ask for Lord but it's the kind of services that we need to make sure we're ready and Lord I put myself at the Forefront if there's anything in my life that's contrary if there's anything that's holding me back from being what you would have me to be Lord I I pray that you come down and burn it out with the fire of God that would cleanse my lips cleanse My Life Cleanse my home and my job my work whatever it would be that I could be pleasing to you because I see the importance of being ready everything else is just temporary but being ready and being in the word being what you would have us to be is eternal Lord Jesus help us this morning in Jesus name we pray amen you can have your seats this morning this is okay if I take my time well you gave me permission so here we go brother random says uh you can hear the word of God and then sit still friends how can you hear the word of God and sit still friends don't you see that science says about five years ago that it's three minutes till midnight he said do you know what God did he said because it's past time and he said do you know what God did he said he reached out with his hand and stopped God stopped time he said he reached out with his hand and stopped it with his hand for the church to make herself ready God thought enough about you and I our families our children that he would say this is getting too close to the end I've got everybody ready and everybody in I'm stopping time to allow my people time to prepare he stopped time he said there's a few more yet to come into the body of Christ maybe some of them was here today he said that's why I'm here to persuade you and this morning if I could persuade you and myself my family that it's a late hour and he says I'm not here to persuade you that don't be Catholic don't be Methodist or you can throw any denomination and you can throw a message in there he's not here to persuade you to be don't be those things he said I'm not saying it's what you belong to you can belong to all of them you can belong to none of them but what I want is for you to be filled with his spirit if we can find ourselves filled with God's spirit it doesn't matter what you claim to be where you claim to go who your pastor is but it matters what if you're filled with God's holy spirit and he says remember on that day I'll meet you on that day you've heard it he says I will meet you on that day he says and these words will be a witness against you he said go on God's tape recording and this great picture camera of Heaven listen to this and you're sitting and walking away and leaving it now when I said that somebody went through your mind let's not worry about somebody because I will tell you this if we're not careful we begin to progress into worldliness step by step instead of staying with what the message said I'm guilty you're guilty we're all guilty you'll see your own self at that day in the mirror of God so I say check ourselves before we wreck ourselves we look into the word of God and we want to make sure that we're doing what God would have us to do that we're living the life God would have us to live in 1988 brother Butler used Kenny Rogers I'll use Michael Jackson 1988 Michael Jackson sang a song and debuted a song and went to the top of the pop charts and it's titled Man in the Mirror and this song it talks about changing the world and the entire theme of that song it says if you're ever going to make a change in this world and make it a better place you have to first start looking at yourself you have to start looking at the man in the mirror and that's what he said he said I'm starting with the man in the mirror he said I'm asking him to change his ways why would I worry about somebody else when I'm not even right yeah Emmy Michael listen I want you to listen to the next verse and this lyric a lyric in this verse and it repeats itself over and over and says no message could have been any clearer this is Michael Jackson what could we say no message has been any clearer and his song He's there's no message could have been any clearer if you want to make the world a better place take a look at yourself and make that change and we have been given a message of the hour we've been giving it a message of an hour that I find very ironic that that song would even say that and top the pop charts and become one of the most recognized iconic songs to this day saying over and over and we have been given a message that is absolutely there's nothing clearer that's ever been said brothers and sisters I tell you this morning that clear message of this hour is clear-cut that message of this hour is clear-cut to make our way a better place to make our world a better place to make your home a better place to make your marriage a better marriage to make your life your children's life your neighbor's life the place that you work look in the mirror but many times the problem is we just don't take time to look and examine ourselves we don't stop to truly look at ourselves and then when we do we don't make that change you know we have we don't take time to review Our Lives against the standard by which we should be living and honestly say I need to make a change you say well I think I'm doing all right that's not what the word says it says You Must Die daily it says we must die daily that is taking an examination of yourself and seeing where you're falling short and honestly looking and say God I need change I need to come to the Altar and I need to lay down this this hindering me in my life this or this others are you a stepping stone or a stumbling block yes here we would have to put the employees in it was my job and we had to do staff performances evaluations hated them I hated doing and I would pull the staff in and set them down in front of me and we begin to talk and we would discuss and I would say well how do you think you've done in the last year 99.9 percent of the time the responses I get were all positive oh I'm a team player I'm never late I don't make errors you know I get along with everybody I love my residence over and over I'm a positive all positive over and over and over all positive you know it's real easy to look at ourselves and see success it's real easy to look at ourselves and say I'm successful compared to so and so my family is prospering compared to so and so but what do you do when you look and you say how successful am I when I look at the handbook because that's what I would do when I would sit down with this and I would say you know you're exactly right you're never you're hardly ever late you got perfect attendance you're this this and this but what about when I look at the handbook and you're not lining up with a handbook and the of the company handbook with this policy you're not lining up with the company handbook with this policy and then they get a little defensive you know they don't like nobody likes to be told what you're doing wrong but as Christians and Believers we need somebody that will stand up here and tell us where we're falling short step on our toes kick us in the backside and say get with the program and the preachers do that because they care because they love you easy to see good qualities and many times as Christians I believe we come complacent and content with our lives and it's because God has been so good to us we can't deny that nobody in here can deny that God has been so good to you you prosper as as business people you prosper in your careers your families are prospering your children are prospering life is good and it's so because of that it's so often times we find ourselves we fail to realize that God is still wanting a Christian to be thankful for these prosperities and we go through life at this point in our life we go through life and somebody comes up a preacher evangelist Pastor whoever yes maybe it's just a lay member maybe it's your neighbor again and think well maybe maybe I'm not just right here but then we just only pay attention attention to it and those words begin to fall on deaf ears because we're prospering life is good things are going as you planned them man we're rolling and all of a sudden everything that you hear doesn't apply to you it doesn't apply to you anymore because you you don't you don't even have to go you don't even have to pray God just gives gives gives gives and you find yourself down there sometimes and you begin to wander and and wonder is words falling on deaf ears you know Jeremiah in the Bible there it talks about in Jeremiah and God comes down and talks to Jeremiah says you know Jeremiah I'm going to give you a word of mine to share with my people I'm going to give you a word and I want you to go out and speak and I want you to do all that now keep in mind Jeremiah's about 15 years old when God comes to him and tells him this and Jeremiah then responds back to the back to God and says listen I'm too young for this God I can't take your word I'm not polished I'm not seasoned I'm too young I can't do this and God says I'll help you and what did God say he was going to do if you if you study your Bible and you look back in there and you read on it he says God said he touched his lips God come down and touched his lips and told Jeremiah Jeremiah don't worry I'm going to put the words into your mouth I'm gonna tell you what to say and I want you to do it no matter what and I will protect you and God warned him when you speak these words they're coming for your life now how would you like that responsibility and Jeremiah here God comes down to him and tells him all right it's time we're fast forward 15 years he's about 30 years old now and God says it's time for you to speak the words that are placed in your heart and on your lips and Jeremiah begins to call the tribes from the north all these people that God is telling him are wicked and all the people that are forsaken him and it says that he God told him he said Jeremiah they're burning incense to their gods idols Idols in their lives so I asked us this morning is there anything in our lives that we cherish and we put forward and we and we nurture and we and we pull close to us and we put above God because that's exactly what these people were doing that Jeremiah was going to speak to they had idols and he says they're they're worshiping The Works of their own hands so these people are worshiping idols and they're worshiping and and the prophets of their own hands their businesses are flourishing you say well we got to be careful we got to be real careful here and then he looks there and he tells Jeremiah to stand strong say to him everything that I command you and Jeremiah tells them change your ways change what you're doing don't follow deceptive words follow the word of God don't find yourself listed to men outside of the of the message and taking leadership and guidance stay right with the word stay with the word stay with the word and Jeremiah's preaching this and as it goes forward he comes back and these people are sitting there and they look at him and they look at him and they say even though God commanded you these words you know where he was preaching at you know where these words were spoken at the Bible tells you they were in the house of the Lord these people all gathered in the house of the Lord these wasn't heathens they gathered in the house of the Lord and Jeremiah speaking and commanding these people to do what God had told them to do and they look at him and they say you shall die don't tell us what to do you see how the mindset can change so quickly foreign don't tell us what to do we are successful we don't have to follow the rules anymore they don't apply to us anymore and said God come down there and God begin to talk and God says don't worry Jeremiah I told you I'd protect you I'm going to take care of you and that's exactly what he did but these people brothers and sisters they did not see themselves anymore in God's message let that sink in for a minute they were around it they knew it they heard it they knew the message they knew the messenger but they could not see themselves and because they couldn't see themselves they began to rationalize everything away and then the gross the ugly the self-destructive the abomination of life that they were living towards God they didn't even recognize it couldn't even see it because of the good things that were going on and brothers and sisters we have to be even be very careful in this hour of plenty that we live in that we don't fall into that same trap and rationalize the message away if it was the message in 1940 1960 it's the message today it didn't change it doesn't change because we're getting older we change but the word doesn't change sometimes we begin to just think we're just okay to live any other way we want to because we're surrounded by the word I've been around this a long time you know there's people been arrested since uh they're still people probably living that was here when when brother Brown was here does that give you security just because you're around it no you have to be in it and it in you so when we begin to put the word on the outside and Surround ourselves with it and not be a participator of it we hinder ourselves and we hold ourselves back from begin being and becoming what God would have us to be let me tell you let me tell you like this your true identity your true God called identity can be lost just that quick it can be lost that quick if we're not careful the bride no longer looks like the bride the bride no longer talks like the bride the bride no longer identifies herself as the bride she no longer Walks Like the dry bride dresses like the bride talks like the bride the bride finds himself going places she used to wouldn't go the bride finds herself saying things she used to wouldn't say the bride finds herself listening to things that she used to wouldn't listen to do you see what I'm talking about God trick our hearts trick our hearts this morning that we don't find ourselves in this rut of life around the message that we're surrounded by the message but we have no part of it because that is very deceptive and that's where Satan wants you he wants those scales over your eyes where you can't even see your own faults you can't even see your own failures you can't see your own shortcomings because you're comparing yourself to brother so and so sister so and so that family hmm yeah we find ourselves doing those things we shouldn't do and then here on Sunday morning it's Hallelujah Mass shout glory god we don't like to change our ways we don't like to change our ways you know why we don't like change our ways because we get full of ourselves and when you're full of yourself when I'm full of myself there's no room for the feeling of the Holy Ghost what I need is to decrease so that he might increase and I need to allow God to come into my life and kick Pride out because pride is the what begins to creep into our lives and says I'm too good I I have too much pride to come to the altar anymore are we too good for altar calls are we are we beyond altar calls and all we want is to be lifted up and placed into heaven and it don't matter how we get there no that won't work that won't work we have to be able to Die daily and find ourselves at an altar of repentance and find ourselves repenting before our peers and making a public example and say God forgive me where I failed you I've got this in my life I need it out I want to get it out so that I can go forward so that I can be an example brothers and sisters we need a humble repentance a humble repentance that will change our ways to change our actions we don't want the word falling on deaf ears deaf ears are your biggest enemy brother Brennan preached a message he used Isaiah 6. he preached a message influence listen to this closely he said you know there are so many of us and most all of us influence Somebody by the things we do the way we live and the things we say brothers and sisters when we realize that we're the most powerful influencers that the world will ever know The Living World it'll change our whole perspective on what we should be doing I'm not talking about being an influencer like on Facebook or Tick Tock one of these celebrity influencers that are trying to get you to do this or do that or do this I'm talking about the kind of influencer that encourages people and leads people to the kingdom of God that's the kind of influencer I want to be listen to this he says we influence somebody somebody is watching your life and then when we profess to be Christians what type of life should we live if somebody is watching us and your life that you live will reflect an influence on somebody this next statement caught my attention probably as great as any I've ever read he said there t-h-e-i-r there Eternal destination will rest upon the way that you live and the things that you do for they watch you when we come to a place brothers and sisters that we hear that and we understand and we realize that it is a responsibility that God has placed on us with that one little statement right there that their Eternal destination will rest upon you that is a responsibility that is greater than anything that I know that I could do on the face of the Earth is it when people watch me when they hear me when they when they see how I react when they when they see what we do as Christians because people want to know what does God and shoe leather do in 2023 what does this good and shoe letters speak in 2023 I will tell you this it's not homosexuality it's not transgender let me tell you you know it's bad and this just come to me it's bad when the beer drinkers boycott transgenders do you realize Anheuser-Busch because they promoted a transgender lost over four billion dollars in sales that's bad when the beer drinkers are taking a stand we're living in a wicked wicked world but to know that the life that I live and somebody watching me could help them make it to that Eternal destination do you see the importance of this morning as we examine ourselves and we look in the mirror and we say am I lining up with the message of the hour am I living according to the standard to God's handbook not what I think's right you know I've got a lot of opinions most of them's not right so I can't live my life and say well I think God would approve of this or brother so-and-so said that God would probably be okay if I do this or if the women do this or if the ladies do this that's not what we go by if he brother so-and-so is not pulling it right out of here brother so-and-so has got his own ideas involved so we have to be careful when we do that because we have no choice but to measure up to God's word and if we're not where we need to be change has to happen he said in our text this morning we find an influence that this King Uzziah he said he was a great influence to Isaiah he said it was a young prophet Isaiah had been called to his side and and Vindicated the prophet of his day and now we find the Uzziah was called to be king at the age of about 17 16 years old and he said after his father's death his father was a great believer talking about Uzziah now his father was a great believer his mother was also a very fine woman and this young king had been crowned at a young age and quickly had taken the road that was right because of the influence of a Godly father and a Godly mother parents your responsibility my responsibility as parents is to set an example before our children that we will live our best at home because the prophet said you will live your best and you will live your worst at home why is that it's because we're comfortable nobody's there we're in the Comforts of our own living room nobody from the outsides looking in the shades are pulled the only people there is you and your children so it's our responsibility to live a life that'll be an example to our children he said though the children might not just act exactly they're noticing they're noticing he said you think that they're not but I'm afraid to tell you they're watching you watch these little babies around here you watch them they're going to do what they've seen to do little sailor she was wanting to shake everybody's hand at our house one night so I changed it up on her I give her Knuckles and said what does she want to do to everybody then it was no more handshaking it was knuckles because she saw somebody do it and so they were beginning to mimic so our children are watching everything we're doing from this size all the way up to I can't reach as tall as mine his size they're watching Lord help us I'll be honest and tell you I've failed I failed many times and I've told myself I wished I hadn't done that I wished I hadn't said that I wished I had implied that but I was comfortable in my own house [Music] not only the children are watching but your neighbors are watching not only the neighbors are watching but those you're associated with are watching you the people at your church watch you the people you do business with in the markets they're watching you after your confession yeah if you say you're a Christian you better act like a Christian always he says reflect Christ in everything we do foreign are full I gotta say out of hypocrites I heard somebody once say that they were trying to witness to somebody and somebody said you know I would go church but ain't nothing but a bunch of Hypocrites there and he said well I'm sure we got room for one more come on down [Music] we can't be putting out a life in confession and not lining up it stumbles people Uzziah begin his Reign at 16 like I said he'd reigned for 52 years and I want you to notice as we get into our story here for the next 30 minutes or so I want you to notice as as we look at you Zaya and the story that he lived the Legacy he left behind where we're at in our day our hour in the United States in the world we live in it's very similar Uzziah reigned for 52 years and overall he was a good King he did what was right in the sight of God and what was according to what his father had done he'd been taught well he was doing good and he sought God in all the days of his life and he began to get in there and he would understand the visions of God and as look but watch what it says here in second chronicles all this is going good as long as long as he sought the Lord God that made him prosper so as long as Uzziah followed the handbook as long as he done what he was supposed to do the kingdom was being built the home was being increased the prophets were beginning to rise and as long as he followed what he did with the what the book said Prosperity was on the rise and use this was a powerful man a powerful man who led military against the Philistines who led military victories against other nations he was known as a strong man and the Bible tells us that his Fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt oh this man was well known uziah was well known as a powerful powerful person life was good under uzziah's reign the United States is pretty good even in a bad shape it's pretty good Prosperity has been on the rise growth has been on the rise think back Tim let's just go back 10 years and see what's happened many of us like I've said before better than we've ever been in our lives uzziah's reign produce that kind of environment but uzziah's life begin to end tragically because Uzziah it says he was strong in his heart and was lifted up to his destruction so Uzziah began to let a little thing we like to call Pride come into his life I am as good as anybody I have a right to what anybody else has or does I'm as good as anybody I can do what anybody else does it doesn't matter if they're priest or profile of the temple when I'll burn my own incense and he goes back there and he begins to burn the incense and the priests come up to him and says you can't do that that's not for you to do and that's a big problem around the message we got people trying to burn incense teach the word preach the word that has no business preaching teaching or prophesying the word it's not their position and it causes people to fall it causes Nations to fall it causes kingdoms to fall and God looks down here and he looks at him and says you done wrong so now I've got to give you leprosy and because of what you've done uziah you will now live the rest of your life in isolation the most rain on the face of the Earth for 52 years disobeys one time thinks of itself a little more than what he is you know the boy the word says that Pride goeth Before Destruction and a holy spirit before the fall with all the successes in his life everything that he had accomplished and done you still can't bypass the handbook in the words of my mama she said boy you're getting too big for your britches Uzziah was getting too big for his britches he thought of himself a little more than what he was so this Kingdom now the Uzziah reigned over is that destruction because because now Ayah has died he was a great and wise King and Isaiah sitting here looking out here now and Isaiah is now finds himself discouraged because this was his mentor this was his friend this is his Confidant somebody he went to and he's now in here and he's he's beginning to get in here and he's going before the Lord at this tragedy and Isaiah is now saying God where are you and all this where are you in the tragedies of our life and Isaiah's setting here let me tell you where he was at he was at the altar in the temple that's why I say it we shouldn't be ashamed to come to the altar in the temple and he's here at the altar of the temple and he's crying out and says God where are you in all this and the vision then Pops in his head and it says I saw the Lord sitting on a throne so now you got to see the picture of this Throne Room Vision that Isaiah is having Isaiah's now said in there and he sees God sitting on a throne and thrown in heaven why was God there God was setting up on this Throne to tell Isaiah that no matter if King Uzziah is gone or not I'm still in control and brothers and sisters we go through things in our lives we go through troubles and trials and hardships whether it's brought on us by us or by others God is still on the throne the throne signifies a sovereign King a throne signifies a judge a throne signifies Authority and Isaiah may have been depressed but God is still on the throne and he said he was high and lifted up here is God Now setting up on this Throne high and lifted up and all of his majesty picture yourself Through The Eyes of Isaiah as you're looking at this pitch you're and go Temple his train filled the temple now back in those days men didn't normally wear trains on their ropes only Kings and hierarchies because it was it was too hard to work in it it was too Troublesome you had to have somebody move it but if you could imagine what Isaiah's seeing as he looks up and he sees God sitting on the throne surroundedly high and lifted up and his train fills the temple so can you imagine God sitting on a throne and the train of his robe is the carpet of this building completely fills the upholstery of the throne room and above it stood of seraphim or seraphims surrounding the throne these angels seraphims cherubbles known as The Burning ones because their their appearance was so bright and it was like fire and it said it was like the Bible tells us I think in Ezekiel that these these charitable the seraphims would move back and forth through through the throne room and it would be like lights of flashing lightning back and forth so much that Isaiah was hard for him to look upon him and they're moving back and forth back and forth the burning ones coming around and each has six things you got to you got to stay with me see this picture Lord help them help us all to see this picture help us to see this throne room picture you got these angels these Sarah films with six wings two of the Wings to cover their face why do they have to cover their face they had to cover their face because the Divinity the divine presence the brightness of God they couldn't even look upon them because even though they were divine they were too lowly the Angels themselves were too lowly to even put their eyes upon God yeah and Isaiah has taken all that the sin and with two Wings they covered their feet they had come humble in the presence of God why do we wash feet to show our humility because it's dirty our feet are nasty they're stinky they're filthy think about walking in sandals and manure and the two they covered their feet to be humble before God so their eyes are covered their faces are covered their feet are covered and with two they fly back and forth and what are they doing as they fly back and forth they're at God's beck and call they're bidding God's business whatever God needs he sends them back and forth back and forth back and forth so the two Wings cover their face they couldn't endure the brightness of God two covered his feet with two they flew willing to serve God and while they're there they begin to cry holy holy holy Stay With Me God on the throne high and lifted up his train fills the temple the seraphim's flying back and forth with such brightness that I can't even be looked upon and there too hum they have to be so humble and they're so lowly that they can't look upon God and Isaiah's taking all this in and now he hears holy holy holy is the Lord holy holy holy is the Lord have you ever wondered why they didn't just say holy is the Lord in English [Music] we use words great greater greatest Hebrew don't use those words so what they're saying is Holy Holier holiest they're flying back and forth and said this is the holy God this is the god that's any other is the very God that is the holiest of all holies this is the king of kings the Lord of lords and the throne room all of this is taking place holy holy holy do you realize that if all of creation were to dissolve today God still sits on a throne [Applause] he was Elohim at one time the self-existing one he didn't need it he desired us and he had desired us to be as he is he desired us to be like he was so by looking at this he sets himself apart from Humanity you have God you have Humanity over here you have God you have Humanity but then they all come down they come together and you begin to look at this and the Bible tells us that yet because we are made in the image of God are you with me we are made in the image of God so this is how Jesus could come and add Humanity to the world the holy spirit is how we can add God into the world and the divine presence of God into our lives brother I said now did you realize that being the person you are being the person that you are you're not all together flesh he said your spirit and flesh not only that but Jesus said that the Bible said that you are in a miniature way gods so that doesn't leave us much excuse to be doing this doing that going here going there seeing this saying that you know I I I tell the kids that I work with on the baseball team I say why did you do that and they try to give me some long excuse I don't hear no excuses you know better and I wonder sometimes if God don't look at us that way and he's thinking why did they do that and then we try to come up well you know I've seen this and it kind of caught my attention that was a little flashy in front of my face and I just grabbed a hold of it and before I knew it I was hooked and he says don't give me your excuses you knew better you knew better he said your miniature gods minutes your way God Jesus said that if prophets and so forth in the Old Testament Jesus was referring to and said it is written in your law that's your gods and if then God's the word of God come to and then why not himself being the Son of God when he makes himself equal with God we are in an amateur way creators um these seraphims these Majestic beings their voices carrying weight back and forth and as they cry holy holy holy with such power and such Authority that the very doorpost of the throne room of God shakes before Isaiah's faith and Isaiah begins to see this and he sees the shaking of the doorpost and it says that this the house was filled with smoke the presence of God in the room if the doorposts were to be shaken because the Angels cry holy holy holy how much more should this building be shaken if we have the same heart if we would sing with the same intensity to God as the Angels sing Holy Holy Holy and sometimes we and I'm guilty we're not in the mood to sing and we sit and we sit who suffers for that is it is it God no no it's us I have found when I'm not in the mood or I don't like the song Leader song and I don't like the the key that it sung in and I saw up like a bullfrog eating Buckshot I'm the one that suffers because I leave grumbly and I leave upset I didn't get to sing tonight because they don't sing in my key I'll be honest we went to Johnson City Youth Services couple weeks ago good great Services brother brother Aaron that's coming here you're in for a treat if you've never heard him you're in for a treat but I always look forward to the song service I love to sing I'm not good but I love it I better it okay we know that and I get that man I'm ready for this this heart up service and that brother is saying like an angel but he sang in an Angelic key that I could not sing I just sang off key I said forget it I was a little discouraged I was a little let down but I wanted to make sure that God knew that I cared enough to share my voice and give back and say God thank you I worship you I send you my glory I send you my praise because you have done so much for me you saved my sin sick soul with the Bloodshed on Calvary and here's where we get to our message Isaiah is seeing all this taking it in keep the picture in your mind and the only words that can be uttered out of his mouth is woe is me I am undone the prophet of God woe is me I am undone Isaiah looks at this situation now Isaiah looks at this situation and and he begins to come apart he understands and he realizes that he's been Measuring Up himself compared to others it's by what standard do you measure yourself up to Isaiah begins to look and he's thinking I'm a pretty good guy I've been doing this for a long time I've got good friends I got church people I know people I'm good friends with the pastor and then all of a sudden he looks at the very presence of God and he sees himself in the presence of God and trembles says whoa what was me for I am undone I'm but a sinner he goes back to that self-evaluation we many times don't see our faults Isaiah didn't see his faults because in the presence woe is me he sees the angels and all their holy humility their obedience to God their praising God back and forth holy holy holy and he realizes not only that it was he not unlike the Lord he was not even unlike the angels he couldn't even do what the Angels had done after all that God had done in his life whoa it's me they cry holy holy holy and praise God over and over and over and he couldn't do it because he was a man of unclean lips and he begins to exhibit he says I'm a man of unclean lips I can't cry holy I came out in the presence of God I can't even stand in the presence of God and cry holy because of the life I'm living the prophet of God for his day and he saw the Lord and he knew what man he really was he didn't measure it up by theology he didn't measure it up by somebody's ideas not his own ideas not the church's ideas but he measured up his life to the very presence of God how many of us this morning would say in the presence of God I find myself woe is me woe is me he saw what kind of man he was and the more he looked the more he knew what he was and at that point in his life Isaiah no longer had Pitchfork religion he said ah I am unclean he didn't say I wish brother so and so could have been here so he could heard that message that was right down his Avenue now he didn't say that woe is me ah ah am unclean because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people with unclean lips sinfulness was exposed you know I don't have to stand up here and call I have not I've not called out one thing that I would consider sin because you know what's hindering your life I know what's hindering my life I can't line myself up with anybody in this building but I have to look up to the throne room I have to look up to the throne room to the very eyes and to the very presence of God and cast my eyes there and say Woe Is Me Lord I have fallen short in this part of my life and he says my eyes my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts brothers and sisters Isaiah was a righteous man Godly by all outward appearances but when he saw the enthroned king the Lord of hosts he saw how sinful he really was and one of these Sarah found seeing Isaiah in total despair aren't you glad God sees our despair that will you know that when you come to the altar when you sat down on your knees before God and you fall down and say God I'm not holy I can't even cry holy because of the life I'm living that he says I see your despair son I see your despair daughter I see where you're standing and now because I know deep down inside you truly love me you truly adore me and you truly want to be in my presence I will send you fire from heaven Isaiah stood there in the presence of God and the center fam goes over to the altar of God with tongs and picks up a lighted cold and touches it to the tip of his of his lips laughs that coal was burning and it was hot do you think that hurt Isaiah the Bible doesn't tell us he felt any pain you say well you know how would we know what he thought he told us everything he saw heard and witnessed in that room did that say anything about pain but Deliverance fire that come down from heaven from the coals of the altar touch the tip of his lips and and touched and burned off all the sin in his life brothers and sisters what happened to Jeremiah well he wasn't adequate to share the word of God he said God went down and touched his lips what happened on the day of Pentecost when they gathered in the upper room the fire fell in tongs of fire touch their lips and they began to speak in unknown tongues there's something about when the fire of God comes it cleanses it opens up a vessel for God to enter in where ourselves matter no more but it's us being filled with God listen to this as we get ready to close the cherubims took the tongs and the coal of fire from The Altar and touched them unclean Lips This is the prophet speaking and he turned him from a coward he turned him from an educated man turning from a teacher to a prophet that the word of God could speak through turned him into a world into a man that the word of God could speak through sure while he was in the presence of God it was something different that thirst that he had had it had reached that place then till he was filled with it the very thing he'd been living his whole life for the very thing he desired the most when he he couldn't find out what is it I'm missing God In The Presence he said I know what it is I need more of you I need the busyness of this life out of my life I need the muck and the mirror in the mud out of my life he says let me tell you friend I don't care how many churches you join how many names you put on your on the book whether you're sprinkled or baptized or whatever you are until you meet that person Jesus Christ I'm not saying there's a single one of you here that's not saved I know I believe most of us most all of us in here has met Jesus Christ but there's a different kind of meeting there's a different kind of meeting when you go into that throne room and he says emotions won't do it a lot of times we want to lean on that excitement emotions just like when I went to the Johnson City I wanted that so bad to enter in and sing and just oh I wanted that but what I found is what I needed was the word and he said emotions won't do it you might jump up and down and shout as long as you want to you might run up and down the floor you might speak in tongues I would love to see all of that he said as much as you want to them things are good and holy I don't say nothing against it but until you meet that person listen to who that person is he says that satisfying portion you can't be satisfied until you meet God he said that satisfying portion is something that takes every fiber in your body not by emotion but by satisfaction let's stand musicians if you'd come I know there's a lot of information this morning in the scriptures there but I trust you saw the picture I trust that God has spoken to your heart trust that you examine yourself in the mirror this morning sister Becky if you just play something soft how many would like to have the throne room experienced this morning as she plays something Softly on the piano we finished early so we're not in a rush no need to hurry but let's just all just close our eyes bow our heads just go before the Lord in prayer this morning say Lord woe was me [Music] Lord as I stand in your presence this morning [Music] and as the word went forth if there's something in your heart that pricked your heart this morning that would cause you to look in

you but if God spoke into your heart here's you an opportunity to look into the eyes of the of God Almighty the creator of heavens and earth who sets on the throne who sets with his train filling the temple in such a holy presence to stand there and come before and say I publicly come before you this morning God I publicly come before you because there's something that has pricked my heart and I know there's something in my life that is hindering me from being the the example that has hindered me from being the Christian that is hindering my family from going forward with you god that is hindering my children when they see me and I just want to come before you and to alter this morning Lord and raise my hands and say bring the fire from heaven down God and touch my lips clip my soul
