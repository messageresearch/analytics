[20:16] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[20:18] Good to be in the house of the Lord this
[20:20] morning.
[20:22] If we'll just stand
[20:24] and uh maybe brother Joe will open us in
[20:27] prayer this morning.
[20:39] This is the best place to be.
[20:54] Lord, I pray you
[21:00] examine ourselves and see where we
[21:02] stand. We look at the scriptures
[21:09] church
[21:22] without
[21:26] sitting here
[21:28] doubt everyone.
[21:30] They had to
[21:37] susmon
[21:57] our dayord.
[21:59] Too late.
[22:10] Watch it on TV. We realize
[22:21] we
[22:26] heard the prophet say this week.
[22:30] the pastor. He's the over
[22:58] work so different things. We ask that
[23:02] you
[23:05] ask you todayless.
[23:25] Amen. Amen. Amen. Children can be
[23:28] dismissed for Sunday school.
[23:31] And if you'll go with me in the Psalms,
[23:33] we're going to go to Psalms
[23:35] 84.
[23:40] Psalms 84.
[23:51] How amable are the t thy tabernacles, O
[23:56] Lord of hosts.
[24:07] The sparrow hath found an house, and the
[24:08] swallow a nest for herself, where she
[24:11] may lay her young, even thine altars, oh
[24:13] Lord of hosts, my king and my God.
[24:27] or the ways of them.
[24:36] They go for they go from strength to
[24:38] strength. Every one of them in Zion
[24:41] appearth before God.
[24:49] Behold, O Lord, our Behold, O God, our
[24:52] shield, and look upon the face of thine
[24:54] anointed.
[25:05] For the Lord God is a son and shield.
[25:08] The Lord will give grace and glory. No
[25:12] good thing will he withhold from them
[25:14] that walk uprightly.
[25:17] Oh Lord of hosts, blessed is the man
[25:19] that trusteth in thee. God bless you.
[25:22] May be seated, Brother Brian.
[25:36] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[25:40] After two knee replacements, going up
[25:42] and downstairs is still never easy. If
[25:44] you would turn with me to uh
[25:47] Galatians, I mean, not Galatians,
[25:49] Philippians, the third chapter.
[25:52] Would you believe me if I told you after
[25:54] all these years coming up here every
[25:57] Sunday, it's still hard every day I do
[25:59] it, it's not an easy thing because you
[26:01] know you that God is listening and he's
[26:04] watching you and everything that we do
[26:07] has to be by his grace this morning. And
[26:10] I was thinking um
[26:14] with the circumstances in the world this
[26:17] morning, just just like I was saying
[26:19] last Sunday, just
[26:22] think this morning that God thought of
[26:24] us enough that we're here this morning
[26:26] in this assembly this morning, ready to
[26:29] hear from the word of God with our
[26:31] hearts open and our minds open to the
[26:33] condition of the world this morning. And
[26:36] that's a really really makes me love the
[26:39] Lord even more that he would give me an
[26:42] open mind, a clear mind to see the age
[26:45] that we live in this morning to make
[26:46] myself ready for that day when he's
[26:49] coming. And I was, you know, the world
[26:51] is a crazy place. But I was listening to
[26:55] a message while I was in the garden
[26:56] yesterday morning and you know, brother,
[26:59] I wrote some notes that before I even
[27:01] read. I don't I I don't know if I'll
[27:03] even get to read what I was going to
[27:04] read, but
[27:07] he was talking about all the different
[27:09] church ages. He was going back talking
[27:11] to about the children of Israel. And and
[27:15] it really struck me that in this age
[27:17] that we live is no different than in any
[27:20] of those other age. We're all striving
[27:22] to be there on that day. And he was
[27:24] talking about the word of God. And
[27:26] that's the only thing that's going to
[27:28] make us prepared, that's going to keep
[27:30] us clean to be there on that day. And
[27:33] I'll I'll go read I got to read some
[27:36] scripture this morning. Um if you third
[27:39] chapter um the first verse, but I was
[27:42] thinking when I was reading this the
[27:43] last couple of days when Paul's talking
[27:46] about being a Jew, being of the
[27:49] circumcision,
[27:51] I was thinking it's no different than
[27:53] us. I I'll just read and then I'll my
[27:55] thought I'll Paul said here in the third
[27:58] chapter of Philippians finally my
[28:00] brethren rejoice in the Lord to write
[28:02] the same things to you to me indeed is
[28:05] not grievious but for you it is safe and
[28:08] Paul's given a warning here beware of
[28:10] dogs and beware of evil workers
[28:14] forgive my pronunci be beware of
[28:16] confision for we that are the
[28:19] circumcision which worship God in the
[28:21] spirit
[28:22] rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no
[28:25] confidence in the flesh. And that and
[28:28] that message I was listening to
[28:30] yesterday, Brother Brandon was saying
[28:32] the same thing. You have you can't have
[28:35] any confidence in this world or in the
[28:37] flesh. Everything that we have has to be
[28:40] in Jesus Christ. And he goes on to say,
[28:43] though I might also have confidence in
[28:45] the flesh, if any other man thinkketh
[28:47] that he hath whereof, he might trust in
[28:49] the flesh, I more. And he goes on saying
[28:52] who he is, describing who he is. And I
[28:55] got to think, we got to think of
[28:56] ourselves. It isn't what church you
[28:58] belong to. It isn't what society. None
[29:02] of that matters. But this is what Paul
[29:04] had to say. Circumcised the eighth day
[29:06] of the stock of Israel out of the tribe
[29:08] of Benjamin. A Hebrew of Hebrews is
[29:11] touching a law a Pharisee. Concerning
[29:14] zeal, persecuting the church, touch and
[29:17] righteousness, which is in the law,
[29:19] blameless.
[29:21] But what things were gained to me, I
[29:23] counted for loss for Christ. So no
[29:25] matter what I was in the world, whoever
[29:27] I thought I was or what I wanted to be,
[29:30] doing the same thing Paul did, I had to
[29:32] put it all aside to reach out for the
[29:35] cross this morning. Each of us, none of
[29:38] us is different. We all have to put it
[29:39] all aside and reach out for the cross
[29:42] this morning.
[29:43] And uh u I lost my place there. I do
[29:46] that a lot.
[29:49] Yeah. Doubtless I count all things but
[29:51] loss for the excellency of the knowledge
[29:53] of Christ. Jesus my Lord whom I have
[29:56] suffered the loss of all things. Do
[29:58] count them but done that I might win
[30:00] Christ. So again pushing everything
[30:03] aside. And I that message I was
[30:06] listening to brother Brham was talking
[30:08] about it was in August of 1965
[30:12] and he was in the Brham tabernacle and
[30:14] it really struck me you know these are
[30:16] people that had followed brother
[30:17] Brandham probably for 30 40 years and he
[30:20] preach preaches this simple message and
[30:23] he's he's telling the people out in the
[30:25] congregation and through all the hookups
[30:28] that he had on the phone
[30:31] is that you can't be trusting the
[30:33] physical. You have to be trust in the
[30:35] spiritual. You have to let the presence
[30:38] of Jesus Christ. You just got to let it
[30:40] pass through everything and get down to
[30:42] the inner soul. Get down to the seed
[30:44] that's in your heart. You can't count on
[30:46] you've done this or you've done that or
[30:48] you've been here or been there. That has
[30:51] nothing to do with it. It's the very
[30:53] presence of Jesus Christ passing through
[30:55] the outside to the inside of your heart
[30:58] making a change. You can't have it. We
[31:01] don't, you know, we're not trophy
[31:03] hunters. It's not I've done this, I've
[31:05] done that, I've done this, have men
[31:07] here. That doesn't mean anything as a
[31:09] Christian. The only thing that matters
[31:12] is has God taken a crow of that seed in
[31:14] your heart and have you grown in Jesus
[31:17] Christ and I lost my place that I may
[31:20] know him and the power of his
[31:21] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[31:24] suffering being made conformable unto
[31:27] his death. And that means suffering,
[31:30] putting everything aside. If by any
[31:32] means I might attain the resurrection on
[31:35] unto the dead, not as though I had
[31:37] already attained either was already
[31:40] perfect, but I follow out follow after
[31:43] it that I might apprehend that for which
[31:46] I have apprehended of Christ Jesus.
[31:50] And he goes on, everyone that you know
[31:52] people have plaques of certain of these
[31:54] scriptures hanging in the house.
[31:56] Brethren, I count myself to have
[31:59] apprehended, but these things I do,
[32:01] forgetting those things which are
[32:03] behind, and reaching forth unto those
[32:05] things which are before. And I pray, I
[32:08] press toward the mark and the prize of
[32:11] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[32:14] And he goes on to say here, let us
[32:16] therefore, as many as be perfect, be
[32:18] thus minded. If anything other than
[32:22] otherwise minded, God shall revere even
[32:24] this not you. Nevertheless, whereto we
[32:28] have already attained, let us walk by
[32:30] the same rule and let us mind the same
[32:32] things. And as I was listening to that
[32:35] message yesterday,
[32:38] that virtue that God gives you in your
[32:40] heart when you receive the baptism of
[32:42] the Holy Ghost, that should bring about
[32:44] a change in your heart and life. You
[32:47] should be growing each day in your
[32:49] relationship with Jesus Christ. You
[32:51] shouldn't be walking backward. And
[32:54] I know in my own life, we all make
[32:56] mistakes, but you don't look at your
[32:58] mistakes. You look at God's promises.
[33:01] That's what we're following. We're
[33:02] following the promises of God. And let
[33:05] me just finish this reading here. I
[33:07] probably lost my place again. For as
[33:09] many brethren, be followers together of
[33:12] me, and mark them which walk as you have
[33:15] us for an example. For many walk, of
[33:18] whom I have told you often. Now tell
[33:21] you, even weeping that they are the
[33:23] enemies of the cross of Christ, whose
[33:25] end is destruction, whose god is their
[33:27] belly, and whose glory is is in their
[33:30] shame, who mind earthly things. For our
[33:34] conversation is in heaven, which hence
[33:36] also we look for the Savior and the Lord
[33:38] Jesus Christ,
[33:40] who shall change our vile body, so that
[33:43] it may be fashioned like unto his
[33:45] glorious body, according to the working
[33:47] therewith. He is able even to subdue all
[33:51] things in himself. And I was I'm not
[33:54] going to say, but I was listening to
[33:56] what he had to brother Brandham had to
[33:58] say yesterday. And then I'll finish. I'm
[34:01] not going to I have a lot of things I
[34:03] keep brief saying, but the one thing I
[34:05] was going to say this morning, what
[34:07] really struck my heart about what I've
[34:09] listened the last couple of days to is
[34:12] at the end of brother Brandham's life
[34:14] that last year,
[34:16] even though he had preached all the
[34:18] mysteries of Christ, all the things that
[34:21] we needed as believers that he perfected
[34:24] in the day and age, he still simply
[34:26] preached a simple message to the people
[34:29] that you have to believe that you
[34:31] believe. You've got to have the baptism
[34:33] of the Holy Ghost and you have to have
[34:35] the presence of Jesus Christ in your
[34:37] heart and life. Outside of that, we're
[34:39] lost. And I'm thinking of the age that
[34:41] we live in. You know, the world is
[34:43] totally lost this morning. I I mean, you
[34:47] can say that with, you know, you could
[34:49] come up here every Sunday and say that
[34:50] and it would be the truth. But what
[34:53] really strikes me is the total collapse
[34:56] of society. Whether it's our country or
[34:58] any other country in the world, we're
[35:00] seeing the very collapse of the very
[35:02] societies that we, you know, we might
[35:05] have had hope in one day. You I can see
[35:07] right now in the world this morning that
[35:09] if you're hoping in anything out there
[35:12] in the world this morning, you're going
[35:13] to be a miserable person because there's
[35:15] no hope out there this morning in the
[35:18] world. The only hope we have is in the
[35:20] true word of God this morning. And
[35:22] outside of that, there is no hope. The
[35:24] only hope that you have is to get closer
[35:27] to the word of God. And that's what
[35:28] brother Brandham was saying. A believer,
[35:31] a real believer in Jesus Christ is going
[35:33] to be tied to the very word of God. You
[35:36] can't separate the believer from the
[35:38] word of God. The believer won't leave
[35:41] the word of God in this age that we live
[35:43] in. He won't separate himself from the
[35:45] word of God. as he sees the things going
[35:48] on in the world, it strives him closer
[35:50] to the word of God because brother
[35:52] Brandham was talking the word of God is
[35:55] Jesus Christ. It's it is the you know
[35:58] this is the written word but he's you
[36:00] know he's the revealed word. It's I I
[36:04] just realize as I get older I'm totally
[36:06] dependent on the presence of Jesus
[36:09] Christ in my heart and life. It's
[36:12] I just know that in myself. I know I'm
[36:15] going to fall if I don't trust him. It's
[36:16] just the way it is. If I don't put him
[36:19] first in my life and in the things I
[36:21] want to do, I know I'm going to I'm not
[36:23] going to be successful in anything that
[36:26] we do or any hope that we have. Without
[36:28] Christ, there's no hope this morning.
[36:31] You know, I I was going to say that I'm
[36:32] not I I keep saying the same thing, but
[36:35] I as I look at this world and this
[36:38] situation that we see this morning, we
[36:41] see the children of Israel this morning
[36:43] under fire from their enemy. We see the
[36:46] world tearing itself apart. We see
[36:49] people believing things that you thought
[36:51] I thought, you know, I I remember saying
[36:54] 10 or 15 years ago how the homosexual
[36:56] society was going to take over the
[36:58] world. And I mean that's that's normal.
[37:02] Now look at all the the sin and
[37:04] perversion in the world this morning
[37:06] that's well past that. So you realize
[37:09] that as you look at the world this
[37:10] morning if you're trusting anything else
[37:13] other than Jesus Christ this morning
[37:15] it's not going to work for you. The only
[37:17] hope we have I I if I I can't say it
[37:20] I'll keep saying it. The only hope we
[37:23] have this morning is in Jesus Christ.
[37:25] And the thing I was um
[37:28] struck me about what brother Brown was
[37:30] talking about. He was talking about how
[37:33] you know people in a different age
[37:34] believe this and the people in another
[37:36] age believe this and the people in this
[37:39] age believe that. And then he said that
[37:42] they never they never testify to the
[37:46] fact that they were wrong. They just
[37:47] keep moving further and further away
[37:50] believing not believing the truth. So
[37:53] that's what I was saying this morning.
[37:54] Without the word of God and the message
[37:56] of the hour, you don't have anything to
[37:58] bring you back to the fundamental truth
[38:01] of the word of God this morning. So I
[38:04] would say to myself, I consider myself a
[38:07] fortunate man that God was willing to
[38:09] open my eyes on that day. Brother David,
[38:19] Amen. Amen. Let's stand this morning.
[38:22] You love the Lord with all your heart.
[38:25] Amen.
[38:28] All my hope is in Jesus, Sister Becky.
[38:32] And all my hope is in Jesus.
[38:40] Thank God
[38:42] my yesterday's
[38:45] gone
[38:47] [Music]
[38:49] and all
[38:51] my sins are forgiven.
[38:57] Oh, I
[39:00] washed.
[39:03] Are you thankful for that this morning?
[39:06] Oh
[39:08] my hope is in Jesus.
[39:15] Thank God
[39:17] my yesterday's
[39:20] gone.
[39:21] [Music]
[39:24] All my sins are forgiven.
[39:30] [Music]
[39:33] And I
[39:35] been washed by the blood.
[39:40] Amen. Are you glad you've been washed in
[39:42] the blood this morning?
[39:44] Amen. And Amen. This song was playing as
[39:49] I come in this morning. And I don't know
[39:51] if we have the words, Brother Carson,
[39:53] and I don't know it very well, but you
[39:55] help me sing it. Here I am to worship.
[39:58] How many knows that song this morning?
[40:00] You help me this morning.
[40:02] Oh, here I am to worship.

[40:14] that you're my God.

[40:47] Lord.
[40:50] Beauty that made it hard to adore you.

[41:43] glorious in heaven above.
[41:50] Humbly you came to the earth you
[41:55] created.
[41:58] All for love's sake became poor.
[42:05] Here I am to worship.
[42:09] Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say

[43:06] And I'll never
[43:09] know how much it costs
[43:14] to see my sin
[43:17] upon the cross.
[43:21] I'll never know
[43:24] how much it cost
[43:28] to see my sin
[43:31] upon that cross.
[43:35] I'll never know
[43:38] how much it costs
[43:42] to see my sin
[43:45] upon that cross.
[43:50] Oh, here I am to worship.
[43:54] Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say

[1:10:59] this morning. Don't you think? Amen. God
[1:11:02] bless you. It's good to be back in the
[1:11:03] house of the Lord to see everybody out
[1:11:05] this morning. Amen. And Amen. It's just
[1:11:08] good a nice Sunday. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:11] Certainly. Uh we're glad to be shut in
[1:11:13] with God. Amen. Thought I had a little
[1:11:15] something wrote down that said if you
[1:11:17] aren't shut in with God, you better
[1:11:19] hurry and get in. Get shut in with God.
[1:11:21] The missiles are flying. Amen. How many
[1:11:23] know the missiles are flying? Amen. The
[1:11:26] enemy of Iran is the enemy of Israel is
[1:11:29] uh throwing everything they got at God's
[1:11:31] people over there. And we know that the
[1:11:33] devil is throwing everything he's got at
[1:11:35] God's people. Amen. As Gentiles. Amen.
[1:11:38] Praise the Lord. So, amen. We need to be
[1:11:41] shut in with God. Praise the Lord. I
[1:11:44] can't think of any. Oh, I do want to
[1:11:46] say, Amen. Enjoyed the testimony. Amen.
[1:11:49] Wednesday night. Amen. Brother Eduardo.
[1:11:52] And but he wanted me to um cuz I was at
[1:11:55] home and I give him a call on the way
[1:11:57] and and talk to him for just a minute.
[1:12:00] Amen. Because you know from what I was
[1:12:02] getting I was getting that he was only
[1:12:04] in the message for about four or five
[1:12:05] years. And I said, "Well, he's just a
[1:12:06] young one." And yet he knew all this all
[1:12:09] these people in Jeffersonville and all
[1:12:10] that and so forth. But he wanted me to
[1:12:13] make sure and I told him I would to make
[1:12:14] sure that his date on 2021
[1:12:19] was really 2001. Amen. So he got that
[1:12:22] date a little mixed up and he don't want
[1:12:24] amen for you know they all think that it
[1:12:27] was it was that way. So he just wanted
[1:12:28] to make that clear. So amen. We
[1:12:30] appreciate it. Praise the Lord. Had a
[1:12:32] good time. Amen. In the Lord and and so
[1:12:36] God bless you this morning. We want to
[1:12:38] with the help of the Lord basically.
[1:12:40] Amen. What comes to mind is as I begin
[1:12:42] to uh seek the Lord on what to speak on
[1:12:46] this morning. Amen. Uh, I went back kind
[1:12:51] of and you know, even brother Bham said
[1:12:53] that you could preach on this on one
[1:12:55] verse for I don't know how many years,
[1:12:57] hundreds of years I think he said. It
[1:12:59] was way up there. He said because it
[1:13:01] really does all tie together, don't it?
[1:13:03] Amen. And so this morning's message is
[1:13:05] going to tie in, Amen, with what we have
[1:13:08] uh kind of where we left off. Amen.
[1:13:12] Uh, I guess Wednesday. Amen. Not
[1:13:15] Wednesday, Sunday. All right. Praise the
[1:13:18] Lord. God bless you this morning. We've
[1:13:20] prayed. Open your Bibles if you will.
[1:13:22] We'll just get right into the word of
[1:13:23] God. Amen.
[1:13:27] Amen.
[1:13:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:34] Amen.
[1:13:36] Matthew, if you will go to Matthew
[1:13:45] 6.
[1:13:54] and verse 24.
[1:13:57] Amen.
[1:14:00] No man can serve two masters. For either
[1:14:03] he will hate the one and love the other,
[1:14:05] or else he will hold to the one and
[1:14:07] despise the other. He cannot serve God
[1:14:10] and mammon. May God add his blessings to
[1:14:12] the reading of the word. You can be
[1:14:14] seated. Amen.
[1:14:20] I want to basically
[1:14:23] pick up where we left off. I think
[1:14:26] Wednesday evening I told you I had like
[1:14:28] a punchline me uh punchline quote and I
[1:14:32] want to make a I want to make a
[1:14:34] statement this morning.
[1:14:40] And that statement is nobody says it
[1:14:43] like God's prophet.
[1:14:47] Nobody says it like God's prophet.
[1:14:51] Amen.
[1:14:56] Amen. When Noah said it's going to rain,
[1:14:58] nobody said it like Noah.
[1:15:01] Amen. The reason I say that is because
[1:15:05] we we love to read. How many believe? We
[1:15:07] we love to read quotes. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:13] I don't I don't understand anybody that
[1:15:15] wouldn't want to quote the quotes. Amen.
[1:15:19] Brother Bam said, "Just say what's on
[1:15:21] those tapes." Is that right?
[1:15:24] Praise the Lord. Well, I had a I had a
[1:15:28] whole quote on that and I'm going to go
[1:15:31] ahead and read it if if that's okay. I
[1:15:33] was going to pass it up, but now that
[1:15:35] I'm on it, I'm going to go ahead and
[1:15:36] take my time. Amen. We're going to be
[1:15:39] here till the rapture takes place
[1:15:40] anyway. So, we might as well take our
[1:15:41] time. Amen. Before I read it, the reason
[1:15:45] I say that that nobody says it like
[1:15:47] God's prophet because we know that
[1:15:49] surely the Lord will do nothing but he
[1:15:51] revealth his secrets to his servants and
[1:15:53] prophets. Amen. The word of God came of
[1:15:56] old, you know, in the old times. How did
[1:15:59] the word of God how does the word of God
[1:16:01] come to through us? Through his
[1:16:03] prophets. Amen. Paul was a prophet.
[1:16:05] David was a prophet. God speaks to his
[1:16:08] prophets. And so when they say
[1:16:11] something, Amen. Uh that's why I say
[1:16:13] nobody says it like them. And we love to
[1:16:15] repeat that because Amen. It's a
[1:16:17] vindicated word
[1:16:20] in go trying to do God a service without
[1:16:23] it being his will. Back in 1965,
[1:16:26] the seventh month, I think he died in
[1:16:28] the 12th month. So this was just a few
[1:16:30] months before brother Brandham went off
[1:16:32] the scene. He says God keeps his
[1:16:34] promise. Amen. Every promise that he has
[1:16:37] made, he has kept it. Has he told you
[1:16:40] what would happen? It did happen. I
[1:16:43] bring heavens and earth before you today
[1:16:46] in a challenge. Has God ever said
[1:16:48] anything that he has not fulfilled and
[1:16:50] done exactly what he said that he would
[1:16:52] do?
[1:16:54] Amen. Hasn't he done it just the way
[1:16:57] that he said he would do? That's
[1:16:58] exactly. So, will he continue to do it?
[1:17:03] Just don't add to it or take from it.
[1:17:06] Just believe it and walk humbly before
[1:17:08] God, the Lord your God, because we are
[1:17:10] nearing the going into the land.
[1:17:16] Amen. How many feels it? We're getting
[1:17:19] close to the going in of the land. Amen.
[1:17:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:26] Amen.
[1:17:27] And then also he says, he say this, "And
[1:17:30] don't take some new thing. They're
[1:17:32] flying everywhere and there will be more
[1:17:34] that come. How many know that? Yeah, we
[1:17:37] had more new things come up in the
[1:17:39] message. People with this idea and that
[1:17:41] idea and new things.
[1:17:44] Why do you say not take new thing? How
[1:17:45] many believe we have what it's going to
[1:17:48] take to put us in the rapture? Why would
[1:17:50] you want to add to it or take away? How
[1:17:52] many know that is the devil's trick is
[1:17:55] to add to or take away? That's is that's
[1:17:57] how he does things. Amen.
[1:18:01] And uh I won't go go in well I might
[1:18:07] well anyway let me just before I go
[1:18:10] further
[1:18:13] Moses read in the Old Testament he says
[1:18:15] now therefore hearken oh Israel unto the
[1:18:17] statutes and to the judgments which I
[1:18:19] teach you for to do them that ye may
[1:18:22] live and go in and possess the land
[1:18:24] which the Lord your God of your fathers
[1:18:26] giveth you. He says, "Ye shall not add
[1:18:29] unto the word which I command you.
[1:18:31] Neither shall you diminish ought of it.
[1:18:33] Don't add one thing. Don't take one
[1:18:35] thing away." See, you shall keep the
[1:18:37] commandments of the Lord. Your eyes have
[1:18:39] seen what the Lord did to Baal PR. Amen.
[1:18:42] How many knows? We've seen what God did
[1:18:44] in our generation. We seen what God did
[1:18:47] with all of those uh Hindus, the
[1:18:49] Buddhists, and the all of those how he
[1:18:51] challenged them. Come open this blind
[1:18:53] man's eyes and I will serve your God.
[1:18:56] the God that's really God. Come on up
[1:18:58] here and open his eyes. And he was a
[1:19:00] quiet bunch.
[1:19:04] Oh my. Praise the Lord. Amen. A and so
[1:19:07] we've seen it. We've known it. Amen. And
[1:19:10] listen how that God destroyed them from
[1:19:12] among you. He says, "But ye uh did but
[1:19:16] and but ye that did cleave unto the Lord
[1:19:19] your God, ye are alive, every one of you
[1:19:22] this day." Amen.
[1:19:25] And when you shall beget children and
[1:19:26] children's children and remain long in
[1:19:29] the land and he says if they corrupt
[1:19:31] themselves which they did that's what
[1:19:33] happened and make engraven images and so
[1:19:35] forth. I call heavens and earth to
[1:19:37] witness against you this day that ye
[1:19:39] shall utterly perish from the land from
[1:19:41] where you go over Jordan to possess it
[1:19:43] and you shall not prolong your days upon
[1:19:45] it but ye shall utterly be destroyed.
[1:19:48] This was Moses speaking to Israel after
[1:19:50] he had been a vindicated by God and the
[1:19:53] pillar of fire. Amen. How many knows at
[1:19:55] the pillar of fire? Praise be to God.
[1:19:58] How many is glad for that? You know,
[1:20:00] it's something how that uh you know
[1:20:02] critics of brother Brandham how they
[1:20:05] will try to dig something up something
[1:20:07] little somewhere. Amen. to try to prove
[1:20:10] and try to get people to believe that
[1:20:12] that uh he he was false that he was
[1:20:15] wrong on one thing when there's billions
[1:20:18] billions of things. Brother Bam says you
[1:20:21] couldn't even write books on how many
[1:20:23] things that where Jesus would come and
[1:20:25] tell exactly prophesy and tell exactly
[1:20:28] what was right. But no, he wants to try
[1:20:31] to get somebody just to believe on
[1:20:33] something little negative or or what
[1:20:34] they think is wrong when it really
[1:20:36] wasn't.
[1:20:38] Hello
[1:20:39] Amen. It's so so shallow, so feeble,
[1:20:42] isn't it? Amen. But what about all the
[1:20:46] things that he said daily, hourly, and
[1:20:48] when he was here? The thing of it is
[1:20:50] when he was here, they tried to
[1:20:53] challenge the prophet,
[1:20:55] those ministers, 70 ministers in Chicago
[1:20:58] said they were going to challenge him
[1:21:00] and they were going to prove the serpent
[1:21:01] seats wrong. Amen. The godheads wrong
[1:21:03] and all that. He says, "Now God has told
[1:21:05] me." He and brother Bam, of course, he
[1:21:07] said, he told this one ministry, he
[1:21:08] says, "You're not going to have that
[1:21:09] place that you rented. The place where
[1:21:12] you thought you're going to have, you're
[1:21:13] not going to have that." Yeah, we rent
[1:21:14] it. We got the down payment and
[1:21:15] everything. He said, "No, you're going
[1:21:17] to have a certain room, certain and a
[1:21:18] person with that's dressed a certain
[1:21:20] way, a woman with certain clothes on and
[1:21:22] they're going to sit everywhere." Amen.
[1:21:24] And sure enough, as it ended out, you
[1:21:26] know, the hotel or wherever they were
[1:21:28] said, you know, we had already rented
[1:21:29] it. We didn't realize we did. Sorry.
[1:21:31] Here's your money. They had to get
[1:21:34] another one. And he came up and told all
[1:21:35] of these guys this.
[1:21:38] Ain't that right? Told him, "Hey,
[1:21:39] brother Bam, yesterday told me we
[1:21:41] wouldn't have that and that that woman
[1:21:42] would be set this that the other. So
[1:21:44] y'all can do what you want." Brother B
[1:21:45] comes up here and he says, you know,
[1:21:47] because he wasn't going to take the
[1:21:48] challenge, but the angel said, go
[1:21:51] ahead, go. He says, I will be by your
[1:21:53] right side.
[1:21:55] Amen. And then he says, okay, you
[1:21:57] brothers, I understand it. Y'all are
[1:21:59] going to disagree with this and this is,
[1:22:00] you know, on challenge me on the
[1:22:02] serpent. Now, anybody wants to disprove
[1:22:03] the serpent's seed of Godhead, come up
[1:22:05] here and stand by my right side. My
[1:22:07] right side. Go back and listen to it.
[1:22:11] Hello. Did any of them get up? He said
[1:22:13] they were smarter than I thought they
[1:22:15] were.
[1:22:17] Oh yeah. The devil once the servants off
[1:22:19] the scene, they they challenge you. They
[1:22:21] try to, you know, say things, but come
[1:22:23] on. Come on in front of it. Oh my. How
[1:22:25] many knows it's a dare? It's a terrible
[1:22:28] thing to speak against God's prophet.
[1:22:31] That's right. If Jesus Christ, the
[1:22:32] pillar of fire, actually care to have
[1:22:34] his picture taken above it. And I'm here
[1:22:37] to tell you something that millions of
[1:22:39] people that claim they love the Lord
[1:22:40] Jesus that died for him for them on
[1:22:43] Calvary, those people will reject God's
[1:22:45] prophet. They'll reject who God sent,
[1:22:48] they won't believe it, but yet they'll
[1:22:50] say they believe it. They're liars. I
[1:22:52] say this morning, they're liars. They
[1:22:54] don't really love him.
[1:22:58] Amen. All right. Well, this was just a
[1:23:00] little starter. Is that okay? Praise the
[1:23:03] Lord. So, he says, Brother Bam says, you
[1:23:06] know, that that uh uh Moses called
[1:23:09] heavens and earth to witness. If you add
[1:23:11] one thing or take one thing, one thing
[1:23:12] away, he'll not stay in the land where
[1:23:15] the Lord God gives you. Amen. How many
[1:23:19] knows in this generation, this
[1:23:21] generation, there was times when Brother
[1:23:22] Brandham was praying, I pray your
[1:23:24] churches fill up and that God blesses
[1:23:26] you and and fills your churches up. But
[1:23:28] then later after they turned down Jesus
[1:23:31] Christ, he says, "Y'all are everyone
[1:23:33] dead." You're like a turtle that's still
[1:23:35] snapping his mouth and his head's
[1:23:37] chopped off. You're dead and don't know
[1:23:38] it.
[1:23:40] That's right. Amen. How many know they
[1:23:42] were dead? When the prophet said they're
[1:23:44] dead, they're dead. God's not in that
[1:23:45] anymore. God ain't blessing there
[1:23:47] anymore.
[1:23:48] Amen. My It's a strong thing. Now,
[1:23:52] brother Ma'am says, "So say I in the
[1:23:54] name of Jesus Christ." Don't you add one
[1:23:56] thing. Don't you put your own ideas to
[1:23:58] it. Just say what I said on those tapes.
[1:24:01] You just do exactly what the Lord has
[1:24:03] commanded to do and don't add to it.
[1:24:07] Amen. Then he says, "I bring heavens and
[1:24:09] earth to challenge you." Amen. Did I
[1:24:11] ever? Did he ever? No. But he did it
[1:24:13] always exactly what he said. Amen.
[1:24:17] Don't take the new thing. They're flying
[1:24:19] everywhere. Listen, but you take the
[1:24:21] Don't take this new things. The Lord
[1:24:23] your God has declared to you what is
[1:24:25] truth. The Lord your God has vindicated
[1:24:28] what is truth by his word and by his
[1:24:32] spirit.
[1:24:33] Amen. Not by power, not by might, but by
[1:24:36] my spirit, sayeth the Lord. God seeks
[1:24:39] those that worship him in spirit and in
[1:24:41] truth. Don't never start some
[1:24:43] organization or try to build upon
[1:24:46] anything else, but stay humble before
[1:24:49] the Lord your God. For it looks like the
[1:24:51] gates may open into the promised land
[1:24:55] anytime. How many can say that this
[1:24:56] morning? Uh that gate that Amen. He's
[1:24:59] going to split the eastern sky one of
[1:25:01] these days. He's going to make come
[1:25:02] visible among us just anytime. Amen. I
[1:25:06] feel it. It's time. It's getting close
[1:25:08] for him. Amen. to get us and take us in
[1:25:10] a rapture, people.
[1:25:13] And I believe it's time to tighten up
[1:25:15] the armor. Amen. Where Satan comes in
[1:25:17] like a flood. We got to tighten down.
[1:25:19] The devil doesn't like this church. The
[1:25:21] devil doesn't like you. He don't like
[1:25:24] you sitting in a pew here. He don't want
[1:25:26] you here.
[1:25:28] Hello. And he'll do anything. And those
[1:25:31] some of those things we want to talk
[1:25:32] about this morning with the help of the
[1:25:33] Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. May open
[1:25:37] soon. Then let us go on with true
[1:25:40] singing and rejoicing when the bride and
[1:25:43] the groom takes its place upon the
[1:25:45] throne. Oh, let your mind wander a
[1:25:48] little bit. How many knows we're going
[1:25:49] to sit with him on his throne through
[1:25:52] all of eternity? That's what we're
[1:25:54] looking for. Amen. Not a new house, not
[1:25:57] a mansion on a hill, but we want the
[1:25:59] mansion on the hill over there to be
[1:26:02] with him. Live humble, live loving, love
[1:26:05] one another. Don't never get nothing
[1:26:07] among you.
[1:26:09] Amen. If you see something coming up in
[1:26:11] your heart against somebody, get it out
[1:26:13] of there right quick.
[1:26:16] Amen. And Satan will do his best to get
[1:26:18] among you.
[1:26:20] Don't let that happen. Some slick tongue
[1:26:23] fella might come along and try to take
[1:26:25] you away from it. You think they could
[1:26:28] take Moses out of the presence of God?
[1:26:29] No. Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Bam
[1:26:33] says, "We don't want no malice. We don't
[1:26:34] want no strife. We want God and he is
[1:26:38] his word.
[1:26:40] Nobody says it like the prophet.
[1:26:46] Hallelujah. Amen. Now I want to read
[1:26:50] basically where I uh left off and and go
[1:26:54] from there with the help of the Lord for
[1:26:56] a while this morning. Amen.
[1:26:59] I'm praying and you pray for me that I
[1:27:00] will take more time in prayer and study.
[1:27:04] Amen. I need to take more time in prayer
[1:27:08] and study because that's where we draw
[1:27:11] our resources from. The quote that I
[1:27:14] want to kind jump off of pretty much
[1:27:16] pick up and go from is amongst a lot of
[1:27:18] people we find where emotions and so
[1:27:20] forth. He says there becomes tattlings
[1:27:22] and backbitings and all kinds of ungodly
[1:27:24] things. Brother, that's sulfuric acid in
[1:27:26] the church. It's demon power. spirit of
[1:27:28] men and women who get among one another
[1:27:30] and try to push off and say this one's
[1:27:33] not right and that one's not right. He
[1:27:35] says and that one's not right. If you'll
[1:27:37] chase it down nine times out of 10 it's
[1:27:39] the very person making the stir that's
[1:27:42] not right.
[1:27:44] Amen. Now here is where we're going to
[1:27:47] go from. God hates discord among
[1:27:50] brethren.
[1:27:52] God hates discord among brethren. Have
[1:27:56] you got my title up? Seven things that
[1:28:00] God hates is what we want to talk about.
[1:28:02] Seven things. And if you will go with me
[1:28:04] and we'll read that and then we'll um
[1:28:06] come back perhaps just a little bit on a
[1:28:09] couple New Testament scriptures.
[1:28:13] Amen.
[1:28:16] And we want to go to the scripture. And
[1:28:18] I didn't even realize that that was in
[1:28:19] there when I was looking for it because
[1:28:21] but for some reason God laid on my heart
[1:28:23] about these things that God hates. And
[1:28:25] how many knows that there seems to be a
[1:28:27] whole lot of hate going on in the world?
[1:28:31] Amen. There's a whole lot of hate.
[1:28:33] There's a whole lot of chaos. There's
[1:28:35] murder. How many knows those those uh
[1:28:37] politicians, a couple of politicians got
[1:28:39] killed because of political reasons and
[1:28:42] so forth. And so we find that murder and
[1:28:45] chaos and hatred. Amen. And if just to
[1:28:49] recap a little bit, if you'll notice um
[1:28:53] if you'll notice Jesus said that no man
[1:28:55] can serve two masters for he will either
[1:28:57] hate the one.
[1:29:00] Amen. So he says you're going to hate
[1:29:01] somebody. You got to hate something.
[1:29:05] You'll either hate God.
[1:29:08] Hello. Or you'll hate the devil. Don't
[1:29:11] you just hate the devil? Hate what he
[1:29:13] does.
[1:29:15] Amen. Amen. That's exactly right. He's
[1:29:18] cruel. He's meaner than a snake. He has
[1:29:21] no mercy at all. He's a terrible fellow.
[1:29:24] And I hate him. Amen. Now, how many
[1:29:26] knows that we we we love we love
[1:29:30] sinners,
[1:29:31] but we hate sin. We do not love sin at
[1:29:34] all. Those riers and all those that are
[1:29:37] people are doing all of that, you know,
[1:29:39] they're just they're just absolutely
[1:29:41] blind and don't know it. We hate what
[1:29:44] people are doing. We all hate those
[1:29:46] actions. We hate the devil what he does.
[1:29:48] But we love people. We don't hate
[1:29:49] anybody because we got to love our
[1:29:52] enemy. You know, we got to have no hate
[1:29:53] in that manner. Amen. Uh uh towards
[1:29:57] anybody. Amen. Because the the hatred
[1:30:00] that we have is a righteous hatred.
[1:30:02] Amen. I hate to see people caged up. I
[1:30:05] hate to see that eagle all caged up, but
[1:30:08] a man would give a million dollars just
[1:30:09] to see him uncaged.
[1:30:11] I hate what the devil is doing to
[1:30:13] people. Amen. You hate it. You feel bad
[1:30:17] for them. You pity them. Amen. So Jesus
[1:30:20] saying here, you're going to hate one of
[1:30:22] them. You can't serve. We realize we
[1:30:24] can't serve but one master. You're going
[1:30:27] to do one or the other.
[1:30:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:37] Amen. That's the truth, ain't it?
[1:30:40] Prophet says it best. Do you know that
[1:30:43] there that we've had wars and rumors of
[1:30:47] wars?
[1:30:49] Amen. I got to thinking of Trump
[1:30:52] yesterday, I guess it was. They were
[1:30:53] having a big old military parade,
[1:30:58] you know, and I thought, you know, you
[1:31:02] got tanks, you got this, that, and the
[1:31:03] other. I'm waiting for when we stack
[1:31:05] arms. We're not rejoicing about having
[1:31:07] one many military. We're looking to
[1:31:09] stack our arms, aren't we? Amen. Put it
[1:31:12] down. Have peace for a thousand years.
[1:31:14] That's what we're longing for.
[1:31:18] Amen. But there's wars and rumors of
[1:31:20] wars. And if the earth stands, we'll
[1:31:22] have plenty more wars. But do you
[1:31:23] realize that there's only two powers in
[1:31:27] the universe?
[1:31:30] Only two.
[1:31:33] Amen. And all of our differences between
[1:31:36] nations and between each other. Hello.
[1:31:40] Notice how brother Bam says, "Remember,
[1:31:42] but don't let nothing come between you."
[1:31:44] Ain't that right? Because that's where
[1:31:46] the devil works in our differences,
[1:31:49] trying to get little things built up.
[1:31:53] Amen. And all the difference between
[1:31:55] each other and everything. It all
[1:31:56] amounts to two powers. There's only two
[1:31:59] powers, two kingdoms. Amen. and all of
[1:32:02] the rest of the little things that goes
[1:32:04] in connected with either one of those
[1:32:05] powers. Those powers he said is God's
[1:32:08] power and it's Satan's power.
[1:32:13] I want to say there's only two gods. But
[1:32:16] I can't say that because there's many
[1:32:18] gods.
[1:32:19] Is that right? There's many gods. But I
[1:32:22] want to say another thing. Amen. There
[1:32:24] is one. There is only one true God.
[1:32:32] only one.
[1:32:35] Every other god is false.
[1:32:39] Amen. Because they can't create. The
[1:32:42] devil cannot create. He hasn't got the
[1:32:45] power of the spoken word. We'd have
[1:32:47] problems if he did.
[1:32:50] Right. All he can do, brother Ben said,
[1:32:53] is pervert things. Isn't that right?
[1:32:56] Amen. That's God's power and Satan's
[1:32:58] power. every war, every disorder,
[1:33:01] everything that comes along is either
[1:33:03] controlled by God's power. Amen. Cuz
[1:33:06] that's the only two powers or Satan's
[1:33:08] power. That's the only two that there
[1:33:09] is. The power of life and the power of
[1:33:15] death.
[1:33:17] Amen. How many knows that's what the
[1:33:19] devil is? The devil has the power of
[1:33:21] death. The thief cometh not, the Bible
[1:33:23] says, but to steal, to kill, and
[1:33:27] destroy.
[1:33:30] I am come that they might have life and
[1:33:32] that they might have it
[1:33:34] more abundantly.
[1:33:37] He wants more. He wants you to get
[1:33:39] happier. He wants you to have more joy.
[1:33:41] He wants you to have more life.
[1:33:44] Amen. The devil don't come but to rob
[1:33:46] and to steal. Why would anybody want to
[1:33:49] serve the devil?
[1:33:53] Why would anybody want to serve the
[1:33:55] devil? He don't nothing but bring you
[1:33:58] depression, give you sadness, give you
[1:34:01] oh my anxiety and murmurings and
[1:34:04] complainers and discontent and
[1:34:06] everything else.
[1:34:08] I feel bad for those riders. I feel bad
[1:34:11] for the world. Why? Because no matter
[1:34:13] what they do, no matter if they get the
[1:34:15] stay in America, no matter what they do,
[1:34:17] they'll never be happy. Cuz there is no
[1:34:20] other happiness, there is no solution
[1:34:22] for the problem but Jesus Christ.
[1:34:27] Amen. I had this rope up here before
[1:34:30] brother Brian even said what he said. He
[1:34:32] said, "Jesus is your only hope."
[1:34:36] Amen. Of escape. He is the only chance
[1:34:39] that we got of escaping.
[1:34:41] Amen. The devil's grip. The devil's
[1:34:44] prison house. The chains that the devil
[1:34:47] puts people in.
[1:34:49] That's right. Amen.
[1:34:53] Oh, I like that. There's only two. Amen.
[1:34:56] That uncomplicates it. Brother Tommy
[1:34:59] uncomplicates it. Makes it pretty
[1:35:00] simple. Everything that comes,
[1:35:02] everything that goes, every word, every
[1:35:05] thought that you think comes either from
[1:35:07] God or the devil.
[1:35:11] Amen. I believe it's time to cast out
[1:35:14] the evil one.
[1:35:16] Cast him out. Amen. See, Satan, he can
[1:35:19] only his power is God. It's a perverted
[1:35:22] power of God. It's not a real power.
[1:35:27] It's a perversion of God's power.
[1:35:29] Everything that Satan had, death is only
[1:35:31] a perverd of life. Life is I mean a lie
[1:35:35] is only truth mistold.
[1:35:37] Adultery is only a righteous act
[1:35:39] misused. Everything Satan's got is
[1:35:41] something that's perverted, but it's a
[1:35:44] power. Amen. And I like this. And today
[1:35:47] we are sitting here. How many sitting
[1:35:49] there? Well, I'm not. So anyway, don't.
[1:35:53] Amen. Listen. Sitting here and one of
[1:35:55] those powers is going to control us.
[1:36:02] Aren't you glad you know which power is
[1:36:05] controlling you? You can say, "Brother
[1:36:07] Battle, I know which power is
[1:36:08] controlling me."
[1:36:12] Why? Because I have booed the devil
[1:36:14] until he's so small. I need a microscope
[1:36:16] to find him. Cuz he ain't nowhere around
[1:36:18] my house, man. And I'm here to tell you,
[1:36:21] that's the way we need to be. He ain't
[1:36:22] nowhere around. I can't see him. That's
[1:36:24] where God wants him. That's where you
[1:36:26] should have him.
[1:36:31] Amen. He's a bluff. Woo. Say it with me.
[1:36:35] He's a bluff.
[1:36:37] He's a bluff.
[1:36:39] He's a fake. He's an impostor.
[1:36:45] Amen.
[1:36:47] He wishes he was God.
[1:36:51] He is a God, but he's not God. There's
[1:36:54] only one true God. He's a false god. A
[1:36:57] fake.
[1:37:01] Amen.
[1:37:04] God might as well just preach. Kind of
[1:37:07] like when the three Hebrew children come
[1:37:08] up to the king. Isn't that right? He
[1:37:11] says, "Don't you realize I can throw you
[1:37:13] in the fire and I'll bow and we'll save
[1:37:15] you." He says, "And they booed back. You
[1:37:19] ain't got no real power." Ain't that
[1:37:21] right? Amen. When Herod told Jesus, he
[1:37:23] says, "I've got the power to release
[1:37:24] you." He said, "You ain't got no power
[1:37:26] unless my daddy gave it to you. Unless
[1:37:28] my father had given you, you wouldn't
[1:37:30] have no power. So don't think you're
[1:37:31] some God. I know who's God. Amen. Those
[1:37:35] Hebrew children, they knew who was God.
[1:37:37] Who was supreme ruler. You're a fake
[1:37:40] God. You're a fake authority. He's got
[1:37:42] the final authority. God come down and
[1:37:44] said, "That's my boy. I'm going to
[1:37:46] That's my children. I'll stand with
[1:37:48] him."
[1:37:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:53] Put God on the spot. He'll come through.
[1:37:56] Amen. Brother Bam says, "If you want
[1:37:58] your healing, start confessing it. Tell
[1:38:00] the world, "Thank you, Jesus." and start
[1:38:02] rejoicing. Start acting like you are
[1:38:04] healed. He'll come on the scene.
[1:38:09] You're not saved. Start acting like you
[1:38:11] are saved.
[1:38:14] Start believing that you are saved. Oh,
[1:38:15] I'm not saved. I can't get the Holy
[1:38:17] Ghost. Keep thinking that. You never
[1:38:18] will.
[1:38:23] My my my. He's the God of chaos. The
[1:38:26] devil is.
[1:38:27] All right. Now, praise the Lord.
[1:38:32] Now know listen to this. We know that
[1:38:34] this battle that you and I are in
[1:38:37] started in heaven.
[1:38:40] Amen.
[1:38:42] I almost titled this discord in heaven.
[1:38:46] God hates discord. That's where discord
[1:38:49] came from was from heaven. How many know
[1:38:53] division came from heaven.
[1:38:57] Lies came from heaven.
[1:39:02] That's right. Lies, deceit,
[1:39:08] all right.
[1:39:13] Amen. Somehow or other, these things
[1:39:15] were found in the heart of this Lucifer.
[1:39:19] Amen.
[1:39:21] This great first battle that was ever
[1:39:22] fought begin in heaven when Michael and
[1:39:25] his angels fought against Lucifer and
[1:39:27] his angels.
[1:39:30] Amen. The first battle that was in
[1:39:31] heaven. So sin did not originate on
[1:39:33] earth. It originated in heaven. And when
[1:39:35] it was thrown down from heaven, cast out
[1:39:38] of heaven.
[1:39:42] You think homosexuals and all these
[1:39:44] perverts are going to be up there? No.
[1:39:45] They ain't even going to make it there.
[1:39:48] You know, he throwed a bunch of liars
[1:39:50] and a bunch of things, pride and
[1:39:52] everything. He throw that out of heaven.
[1:39:53] He's not going to take it back in.
[1:39:58] Amen.
[1:40:00] And then thrown down from heaven and
[1:40:02] cast out of heaven to earth and it fell
[1:40:04] on human beings. Then that battle from
[1:40:06] the angels became human battles and
[1:40:08] Satan come to destroy God's creation.
[1:40:12] How many know that's why the marriage is
[1:40:15] being destroyed?
[1:40:16] Even male and female is being destroyed.
[1:40:19] Anything that God has ordained, the
[1:40:22] devil is trying to destroy it.
[1:40:25] All you parents tell your children that
[1:40:27] they don't know if they're a boy or a
[1:40:29] girl. We don't know for sure. How many
[1:40:32] know is God is not the author of
[1:40:34] confusion. The devil is the author of
[1:40:36] confusion.
[1:40:38] No, God made male and female. He made
[1:40:40] man and woman. That's right. Amen. And
[1:40:44] so the devils, whether they know it or
[1:40:46] not, they're being used by the devil to
[1:40:47] try to destroy
[1:40:50] God's kingdom.
[1:40:53] And what are we doing? We're up here
[1:40:55] upholding the kingdom of God. You are
[1:40:58] upholding the kingdom of God. We don't
[1:41:00] marry women with women and men. No, we
[1:41:03] despise that. God hates that. It's not
[1:41:06] right.
[1:41:09] Amen.
[1:41:11] Praise be to God.
[1:41:13] That's right. Trying to destroy God's
[1:41:15] creation. What God had created to be for
[1:41:17] himself. Satan come to destroy this.
[1:41:19] That's his purpose was to destroy it.
[1:41:22] Then the big battle begin here on earth
[1:41:25] and it begin in us. And it has been
[1:41:27] raging
[1:41:29] ever since.
[1:41:32] Amen.
[1:41:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:36] It's been raging ever since. Now, we'll
[1:41:38] go to our scriptures
[1:41:41] over in the book of Proverbs.
[1:41:45] Seven things God hates.
[1:41:53] What God hates,
[1:41:56] I hate. Are you with me? God hates it, I
[1:42:00] hate it.
[1:42:02] What God loves, I love. Amen.
[1:42:07] What the devil loves, I hate.
[1:42:13] What the devil hates, I love.
[1:42:19] Amen. That's right. Cuz the devil hates
[1:42:22] God. I love God.
[1:42:26] All right. Chapter six of Proverbs.
[1:42:34] These six things
[1:42:37] does the Lord hate. Did I say six or did
[1:42:40] I say say seven? Right. Seven things
[1:42:42] that the Lord hates. Seven are an
[1:42:45] abomination unto him. A proud look, a
[1:42:49] lying tongue, hands that shed innocent
[1:42:51] blood, a heart that devises wicked ima
[1:42:53] imaginations, feet that is swift to
[1:42:55] running the mischief, a false witness
[1:42:58] that speaketh lies, and he that sweth
[1:43:01] discord among brethren. Amen.
[1:43:07] Number one, a proud look,
[1:43:12] pride.
[1:43:14] How many know God hates pride?
[1:43:22] I didn't pull this scripture up so I
[1:43:24] can't go to it, but
[1:43:26] somewhere in Peter, Peter says, "Humble
[1:43:28] yourselves under the mighty hand of God,
[1:43:31] and he will exalt you in due time." And
[1:43:34] in another place, it talks about, "He
[1:43:36] that humbles himself, God will lift up.
[1:43:39] And he that
[1:43:42] lifts himself up shall be what? A
[1:43:44] based."
[1:43:45] We always talk about the way up is what?
[1:43:48] The way up is down. So, let me ask you,
[1:43:52] which way is down? What's the way down?
[1:43:56] That's right. The way down is up. Why?
[1:43:59] If you lift yourself up, what comes
[1:44:02] before downfall? Pride comes before
[1:44:05] downfall.
[1:44:07] That's right. So, you get lifted up. And
[1:44:09] what does Satan? He li He got lifted up.
[1:44:12] How many know he's in for a downfall?
[1:44:15] That's right. He's in for a downfall.
[1:44:19] So, we're going to deal with the devil
[1:44:21] in heaven. Had pride in his heart. He
[1:44:25] got proud. He had pride. He wanted
[1:44:28] prestige. He wanted popularity. He
[1:44:31] wanted something. He wanted to be a
[1:44:33] somebody with his chest stuck out and
[1:44:35] stuff.
[1:44:37] Cuz in chapter 14:12, it says, "How art
[1:44:40] thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son
[1:44:42] of the morning? How dust thou how art
[1:44:44] thou cut down to the ground which did
[1:44:46] weaken the nations? Because thou has
[1:44:49] said in thine heart I will ascend.
[1:44:52] See the devil was wanting to go on up.
[1:44:54] He want to go up and he says you're
[1:44:56] going to be brought down.
[1:44:59] Amen.
[1:45:01] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:45:03] of God. I will sit upon the mount of the
[1:45:06] congregation on the sides in the north.
[1:45:08] I will ascend above the height of the
[1:45:10] clouds and I will be like the most high.
[1:45:13] In other words, he got proud and he
[1:45:15] wanted to be somebody.
[1:45:18] How many know when you want to be
[1:45:20] somebody, you're on your way down.
[1:45:22] When you realize you're a nobody and
[1:45:25] stay there, stay on the Damascus dust.
[1:45:27] Realize you're a nobody.
[1:45:30] Amen. Then God will raise you up and
[1:45:32] he'll use you for his kingdom. Amen. But
[1:45:35] when you get pride, when you get lifted
[1:45:37] up in pride, look out. You're in for a
[1:45:39] downfall.
[1:45:41] So this pride originated in heaven.
[1:45:44] That's why God hates it so much. God
[1:45:47] hates that pride. These things I hate. A
[1:45:49] proud look.
[1:45:51] I want to be like I want to ascend above
[1:45:52] the stars of God. I want to be up there
[1:45:54] on the throne. I want to be worshiped.
[1:45:58] I want to be like God. I want to be like
[1:46:00] the most high.
[1:46:06] Amen. And then I pulled the thought into
[1:46:10] also
[1:46:12] where he says uh
[1:46:15] where brother Brandham said.
[1:46:23] He said spirit of men and women will get
[1:46:26] off on one another, push off and say
[1:46:27] this one's not right and that's not
[1:46:28] right. And if you chase it down, right?
[1:46:31] So I can only imagine that this phrase,
[1:46:34] this phrase of this isn't right and
[1:46:36] that's not right. Amen. That that
[1:46:38] started in heaven.
[1:46:42] Huh? The devil was saying, "God, you get
[1:46:45] all the glory.
[1:46:47] Everybody worships you. We're holy.
[1:46:52] Why can't we get some of that worship?
[1:46:55] Why can't we get some of that
[1:46:56] recognition?"
[1:46:59] Hello. People want recognition. People
[1:47:02] want position. If you want that, you
[1:47:04] better watch out. What kind of spirit?
[1:47:08] Woo. And people will go to great measure
[1:47:11] and length and do crazy stuff
[1:47:14] just to try to have that recognition,
[1:47:16] have a little following, have people
[1:47:19] look up to them as they're somebody.
[1:47:22] It's a devil spirit.
[1:47:26] Hello.
[1:47:28] My
[1:47:30] that's right. How art thou fallen? Thou
[1:47:34] said in thine heart, I will ascend. He
[1:47:36] had pride
[1:47:38] in his heart.
[1:47:41] Amen.
[1:47:44] Now back to our thought,
[1:47:48] back to Proverbs.
[1:47:52] Proud look and a lying tongue.
[1:47:58] Not two times he uh talks about a lying
[1:48:00] tongue in here because a false witness
[1:48:03] that speaketh a lie is down in verse 19.
[1:48:08] God hates that.
[1:48:10] Is that right? So a lying tongue,
[1:48:13] remember in Revelation it says that all
[1:48:15] horongers and liars,
[1:48:19] murderers, all they shall have their
[1:48:21] part in the lake of fire. God hates a
[1:48:23] lie because it's the truth
[1:48:26] misrepresented.
[1:48:28] A lot of times it's 99%
[1:48:31] truth.
[1:48:35] If there's ever somebody in a church
[1:48:36] that has a little bitterness in their
[1:48:38] heart, they will tell 99% this person
[1:48:41] pretty good, but
[1:48:43] but you know they got this problem. They
[1:48:46] got that problem this that or the other.
[1:48:48] Oh, watch out.
[1:48:51] Hello.
[1:48:53] Watch what you say.
[1:48:55] A lying tongue. Because the devil lied,
[1:48:58] didn't he? The devil had to lie to those
[1:49:01] angels.
[1:49:05] God hates that lie. He hates a liar.
[1:49:12] Always tell the truth.
[1:49:15] And hands that shed innocent blood.
[1:49:19] hands that shed innocent blood.
[1:49:24] In other words, a murderer.
[1:49:27] Who was a murderer in the Bible? Cain.
[1:49:31] The son of the serpent.
[1:49:33] So God hates a murderer.
[1:49:37] Amen.
[1:49:39] Because that murdering spirit came from
[1:49:41] heaven. That's right. came down into the
[1:49:45] serpent
[1:49:46] and had that hatred
[1:49:49] hatred of God's people.
[1:49:53] My
[1:49:58] This is Father's Day, right?
[1:50:01] Amen. I guess you realize that people
[1:50:05] have daddy issues.
[1:50:09] This world has daddy issues.
[1:50:15] Because why? For one thing, they're like
[1:50:18] their daddy. People tend to be like
[1:50:21] their daddy.
[1:50:23] Amen. I can look in the mirror and see
[1:50:24] certain reflections of my dad.
[1:50:28] Amen.
[1:50:30] How many knows Cain had daddy issues?
[1:50:34] He didn't have a problem. He didn't have
[1:50:36] a problem telling God, you know, I know
[1:50:38] you said that if I do what my brother
[1:50:40] did, I'll be accepted, but I ain't doing
[1:50:42] it. I ain't repenting.
[1:50:46] I don't know if the devil was ever given
[1:50:48] a chance up in heaven or not, brother
[1:50:49] Tommy. I don't know if he was given a
[1:50:50] chance and all the angels. All right,
[1:50:53] you guys. All right, you either on his
[1:50:56] side or you come over here on my side
[1:50:57] cuz how many knows in the earth? That's
[1:51:00] what God did when Nathan and Car come
[1:51:02] down and worship and so forth. And Amen.
[1:51:04] And they all thought that they were
[1:51:05] holy. And finally Moses had said,
[1:51:06] "Everybody that's on our side, on my
[1:51:09] side, come on over.
[1:51:13] God always was graceful. He had mercy.
[1:51:17] Amen. And even Moses said God vindicated
[1:51:20] him, you know, cuz God destroyed him at
[1:51:23] LPR. Amen. Those who stayed with Moses,
[1:51:26] they are still alive.
[1:51:30] Amen. But God gave him a chance. Give
[1:51:32] him a chance to make a choice. And you
[1:51:35] know, I I want to say something else.
[1:51:37] I've got it in here. Amen. That God
[1:51:39] hates bad choices.
[1:51:43] God hates bad choices. I I guess I
[1:51:46] won't, but brother B talks about the
[1:51:47] great battle that that that we face.
[1:51:50] Amen. God chose and the devil chose.
[1:51:53] Amen. He the mutual ground and the
[1:51:55] greatest battle ever fought is in the
[1:51:57] human mind. How many know this is where
[1:52:00] the battle is? Why? Because you have the
[1:52:03] power of choice. Why? We be cows. We
[1:52:06] just eat grass and move. But we ain't
[1:52:08] just cows. We know right from wrong. We
[1:52:10] are given a choice
[1:52:13] and bad choices. I don't know about you,
[1:52:15] but I hate choices. I think back in my
[1:52:18] life and I think of the bad choices I
[1:52:20] made and I regret it to this day. I wish
[1:52:22] I wouldn't have made that bad choice.
[1:52:24] Young people don't make bad choices.
[1:52:26] You'll regret it.
[1:52:28] God hates bad choices. He hates the
[1:52:31] choices that he made. He hates the
[1:52:32] choice that Eve made. Eve made a bad
[1:52:34] choice. God loves when you make good
[1:52:37] choices.
[1:52:40] Thank you, Lord. Amen. Was it Sister
[1:52:43] Hadtie right? She chose to say, "That
[1:52:45] ain't nothing but the truth." God says,
[1:52:46] "I love her. I love what she said. I
[1:52:49] don't care if it's a billion dollars.
[1:52:51] Tell her whatever she wants, she can
[1:52:53] have." God loves good choices.
[1:53:01] Amen.
[1:53:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:07] Lord, help us to make good choices.
[1:53:08] Amen.
[1:53:11] Every day you make choices.
[1:53:14] This is an ongoing battle.
[1:53:17] Amen. We'll fight this battle all the
[1:53:19] way to the end. It's a continuation
[1:53:22] continuing battle.
[1:53:25] Amen.
[1:53:26] Satan will constantly punch at you until
[1:53:29] you're finished here on the earth. Just
[1:53:31] remember that. You'll never have a time
[1:53:34] but where there's a punching going on
[1:53:35] all the time cuz you're in a battle.
[1:53:39] Amen.
[1:53:40] Woo. How many knows
[1:53:44] I got wrote down here this this so get
[1:53:47] behind get fortified
[1:53:49] cuz we're living in what they call you
[1:53:52] know even the riots has said this is a
[1:53:54] liquid situation.
[1:53:56] A liquid situation. In other words,
[1:53:58] somebody might hit me with a rock at any
[1:54:00] time. We don't know which way this will
[1:54:02] go in the next five minutes. It's a
[1:54:04] liquid situation. Amen. out there. This
[1:54:06] world is in a liquid situation. There's
[1:54:09] no real anchor there. It's all sales and
[1:54:11] no anchor.
[1:54:16] Amen.
[1:54:18] It's a constant battle. You have to
[1:54:20] watch every day. You have to be on guard
[1:54:21] all the time.
[1:54:26] Amen.
[1:54:27] This is not a picnic. Amen. If you think
[1:54:30] it is, you're sure going to be surprised
[1:54:32] because it's a constant battle. I've
[1:54:34] been on the field for 31 years and I
[1:54:36] fought every inch of the way. That's
[1:54:37] right. Israel had to fight for every
[1:54:39] inch of the way. You have to fight for
[1:54:41] every You have to guard constantly.
[1:54:44] Situations come up. Amen. Your
[1:54:46] situation, conditions, things happen in
[1:54:48] our lives, church,
[1:54:51] things happen in the church. Things
[1:54:53] happen to you.
[1:54:55] Amen. Like brother Brad said a couple
[1:54:58] weeks ago, something happened and well,
[1:55:00] you know, he had a mind battle. He had
[1:55:01] to fight that thing out.
[1:55:03] Ain't that right? Cuz something always
[1:55:05] comes up. Something will come up.
[1:55:06] Something will come up next week.
[1:55:08] Something will come up next month. Sure.
[1:55:10] But how many know you better be on your
[1:55:12] prayer bones and you better say, "God,
[1:55:14] help me. Guard me from any thought that
[1:55:16] is not like you and help me from keep
[1:55:19] every thought out that would torment me
[1:55:21] and bring me fear and doubt and
[1:55:23] frustration."
[1:55:26] That's what he is. He's the God of
[1:55:29] frustration.
[1:55:32] Lies.
[1:55:34] Lies
[1:55:36] bring discord.
[1:55:38] Amen. They bring they cause discord.
[1:55:44] Amen.
[1:55:48] All right.
[1:55:51] Father issues.
[1:55:54] Listen. I know he said that ye are
[1:55:56] Abraham's seed, but ye seek to kill me.
[1:56:00] Amen. They were wanting to shed innocent
[1:56:04] blood.
[1:56:05] They wanted to kill Jesus.
[1:56:08] Because my word has no place in you. I
[1:56:12] speak that which I have seen of my
[1:56:14] father and you do that which you have
[1:56:16] seen of your father. In other words, you
[1:56:17] got your daddy's nature. You're a bunch
[1:56:20] of murderers.
[1:56:23] You're a bunch of hypocrites. You're
[1:56:25] sheep and wolves.
[1:56:27] You're wolves and sheep clothing.
[1:56:30] [Laughter]
[1:56:33] Amen. I think I preached on that a
[1:56:35] couple weeks ago. I said we were
[1:56:38] uh we were sheep in wolves clothing
[1:56:41] is what we were because brother Bam says
[1:56:44] that seed on the inside we have the
[1:56:46] nature. We were by nature the children
[1:56:49] of wrath, right? And it looked like we
[1:56:51] were just a bunch of hippies and a bunch
[1:56:53] of sinners and everything else. But down
[1:56:55] here was a seed. Down here was a sheep.
[1:56:58] the outside. And what did we do? We
[1:56:59] finally came to what we were and we
[1:57:01] throw that old wolf nature off of us and
[1:57:04] become what we were supposed to be and
[1:57:06] what we were all along. Sheep.
[1:57:11] It's better to be that than the other.
[1:57:15] Amen. Praise the Lord. So he says,
[1:57:17] "That's right. You do what you have seen
[1:57:19] of your father." Then answered, they
[1:57:21] answered and said unto him, Abraham is
[1:57:23] our father. Jesus said unto unto them,
[1:57:27] "If you were Abraham's children, you
[1:57:30] would do the works of Abraham." Another
[1:57:33] place he says, "If you can't believe me,
[1:57:34] why can't you believe the works? Ain't
[1:57:36] nobody can raise the dead." Right?
[1:57:38] Unless he's right of God. Even Nicodemus
[1:57:40] said, "We know that you're of God, cuz
[1:57:42] nobody can do these things." Amen. But
[1:57:46] now ye seek to kill me, a man that has
[1:57:48] taught you the truth which I have heard
[1:57:50] of God. This did not Abraham. Ye do the
[1:57:53] deeds of your father.
[1:57:56] Then came they said unto him, we be not
[1:57:59] born of fornication. We have one father,
[1:58:02] even God. Oh yeah. They wanted to look
[1:58:05] for something in Jesus. They found
[1:58:06] something.
[1:58:08] Yeah, that's right. Joseph and Mary were
[1:58:11] espoused,
[1:58:13] engaged. How many knows in the eyes in
[1:58:15] the Old Testament and they're new now
[1:58:17] that if you get engaged, you're as good
[1:58:19] as married.
[1:58:21] They say you was, you know, he wasn't
[1:58:22] even really formerly married and
[1:58:24] everything else and so you were born of
[1:58:25] fornication. Oh, they they found a way.
[1:58:29] Jesus said unto them, if God were your
[1:58:31] father, you would love me. That's why I
[1:58:33] said earlier people that want to say
[1:58:34] that they love Jesus of the Old
[1:58:36] Testament, not or of Calvary back then.
[1:58:38] But they refuse the vindicated proven
[1:58:42] Jesus of today shows what they would
[1:58:44] have really done. Amen. If you
[1:58:48] I proceeded
[1:58:50] came forth from God, neither came I of
[1:58:51] myself. Why do you not understand my
[1:58:53] speech? Because you cannot hear my word.
[1:58:55] Ye are of your father the devil.
[1:59:02] My my my
[1:59:06] people probably it probably didn't even
[1:59:08] bother. They were so cold in their
[1:59:11] hearts that Jesus himself said, "You're
[1:59:14] of your father, the devil." I don't know
[1:59:16] about you, but if somebody just raised
[1:59:18] Lazarus from the dead and healed the
[1:59:19] open eyes and he told me that I was of
[1:59:21] the devil, I would get weak in the
[1:59:23] knees. Oh no, don't say that. Please
[1:59:25] don't say that. I don't want to hear
[1:59:28] that.
[1:59:30] But he was that straight with him. He
[1:59:32] told him who their daddy was because
[1:59:33] he's a murderer. Amen.
[1:59:38] Listen. And the lust of your father will
[1:59:41] ye do. For he was a murderer from the
[1:59:44] beginning.
[1:59:46] That's right. Okay. And he was a
[1:59:47] murderer from the beginning. He shed
[1:59:49] righteous blood. Abode not into truth
[1:59:52] because there's no truth in him. When he
[1:59:54] speaketh a lie, he speaketh of himself
[1:59:57] for he is a liar.
[2:00:01] Amen. Oh, you'll never be saved. You'll
[2:00:03] never be healed. Liar.
[2:00:06] You'll never be a Christian liar. You'll
[2:00:08] never make the rapture liar.
[2:00:11] How many know the devil is a liar?
[2:00:19] And I will say he's a good one.
[2:00:25] The devil is a good liar. He's good at
[2:00:29] it.
[2:00:31] I mean, he can go 99% truth.
[2:00:36] He went to Eve. God knows no this that
[2:00:38] or the other. Yay, God has said, but ye
[2:00:40] shall not. Just put one little word in
[2:00:42] there. And when he came to Jesus, he
[2:00:45] says, you know, uh, turn these, the
[2:00:47] Bible talks about, you know, jump off of
[2:00:49] here because the scripture says he shall
[2:00:51] not dash his foot against any stone. He
[2:00:53] used the scriptures against Jesus.
[2:00:57] Brother Brand said, boy, he come up to
[2:00:59] the wrong one. He met a thousand watt
[2:01:01] vaults. fry him. Because what did he do?
[2:01:05] He says, "Yeah, but it's also written.
[2:01:10] It's also written." That's what you got
[2:01:12] to do, devil. I know he says that, but
[2:01:14] it's also written. So, get thee behind
[2:01:17] me.
[2:01:19] I can't help but believe that there's a
[2:01:21] bride in this end time that's got a
[2:01:23] message that don't have to add to or
[2:01:25] take away from it. We've got a message
[2:01:27] that we can open up our minds and become
[2:01:29] an invincible army. Amen. We're going to
[2:01:32] be ready for the rapture. We're going to
[2:01:33] flee to the skies. What a day. Amen.
[2:01:36] Because we shall open up the one mind of
[2:01:38] our womb to this perfect word that he's
[2:01:41] brought.
[2:01:43] Hallelujah.
[2:01:48] That's going to be the avenue that God
[2:01:50] uses in open mind of children to take
[2:01:54] that pure word of God that has been
[2:01:56] identified, that has been vindicated of
[2:01:58] God, proven of God. Amen.
[2:02:02] Hallelujah.
[2:02:06] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:02:09] My my my.
[2:02:11] The devil
[2:02:13] is the God of everything bad.
[2:02:17] Everything bad. He's the god of
[2:02:18] confusion, discontent, disorder,
[2:02:21] division, misunderstandings,
[2:02:23] indifference, funny feeling, bitterness,
[2:02:25] variance, strife, hatred, emulation,
[2:02:29] disobedience. Amen. That's what he's the
[2:02:32] god of.
[2:02:35] Amen. Okay.
[2:02:38] So, covered a proud look,
[2:02:42] wanting to be a somebody, a lying
[2:02:44] tongue. He's a liar. God hate that lie.
[2:02:49] No doubt. But God had to ask the angels,
[2:02:52] "Do you really believe what he told you?
[2:02:57] Do you really believe that?"
[2:03:03] Amen. Cuz it was a lie.
[2:03:08] Remember Dayan, he says, "You take too
[2:03:12] much upon yourself, Moses. You lift
[2:03:14] yourself up above the congregation.
[2:03:17] How many knows that was a lie? Moses
[2:03:21] didn't want the job, did he? God take
[2:03:24] somebody else. Do somebody else. No, I
[2:03:26] didn't lift myself up. God put me here.
[2:03:32] God hated that lie so much. That pride
[2:03:35] that rose up in Nathan. He says, "We're
[2:03:37] only two.
[2:03:39] We're only two." Just like the devil
[2:03:41] did. Hey, we're holy, too, God. You
[2:03:44] don't get all the glory. We want some of
[2:03:45] this glory.
[2:03:48] Watch out.
[2:03:50] Glory seekers.
[2:03:53] Amen. Folks, when I get up here, I be
[2:03:56] careful that I don't Everything's about
[2:03:59] I I I me I I I. Huh?
[2:04:05] It's him.
[2:04:08] Oh, my wife when people say, "Oh,
[2:04:10] sister, you got the fence." She says,
[2:04:11] "No, no, no. It's his faith. It's not
[2:04:14] me. It's him. Give him the glory.
[2:04:18] He gets the glory."
[2:04:21] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:04:25] So bad.
[2:04:28] Greed.
[2:04:30] But let's let's let's stop here. Let's
[2:04:32] go back to lies. Nathan lied.
[2:04:35] And then what did God what did Moses
[2:04:37] say? Moses said, "Go get your sensors.
[2:04:40] get your incense and come up here and
[2:04:42] let's see who God confirms and so forth.
[2:04:43] Ain't that right? Come to find out that
[2:04:46] God vindicated Moses. Is that right?
[2:04:49] Then Moses got to said, "Separate
[2:04:51] yourself. Get yourself away from these
[2:04:54] people."
[2:04:57] Get your get yourself out from among
[2:04:59] them. Get them away from their tents.
[2:05:02] Talk about division. God hates division.
[2:05:05] God a hate separation
[2:05:08] when it's the body of Christ.
[2:05:11] But now when it comes to unbelief,
[2:05:14] Amen.
[2:05:17] You better separate yourself. That's
[2:05:20] exactly right. Amen.
[2:05:23] Paul said it this way. How many, you
[2:05:26] know, there comes a time for separation.
[2:05:30] Unbelief and belief doesn't dwell
[2:05:32] together real well.
[2:05:34] Light and darkness has no fellowship.
[2:05:37] Something that's right and something
[2:05:38] that's wrong doesn't have fellowship.
[2:05:42] No, there's no fellowship there.
[2:05:45] Amen. And somebody that causes divisions
[2:05:48] in a church. Hello.
[2:05:51] Paul said it this way. I command you. He
[2:05:55] says, "I wrote you in an epistle not to
[2:05:58] keep company with fornicators, yet not
[2:06:01] altogether fornicators of this world, or
[2:06:03] the covetous or extortioners, idoltors,
[2:06:06] for then must be needs go out of the
[2:06:08] world. But now I have written unto you
[2:06:10] not to keep company." Hello. Don't keep
[2:06:13] company. If any man is called a brother,
[2:06:15] be a fornicator, covetous, or an
[2:06:16] idoltor, or a Always railing on
[2:06:20] somebody. Always saying something bad
[2:06:22] about people. a drunk or an extortioner
[2:06:24] with such a one know not to eat. So the
[2:06:28] Bible says if there's somebody causes
[2:06:29] divisions, get away from them. Don't
[2:06:32] hang around them. Don't listen to them.
[2:06:35] Amen.
[2:06:37] It's something how that God hates. God
[2:06:40] hates the things that happen. A lot of
[2:06:42] us, a lot of us, we are what we are
[2:06:45] because of the experiences that we've
[2:06:47] went through, the things that we've
[2:06:50] experienced.
[2:06:51] And that's the way it is with God. He
[2:06:54] isn't because of He isn't like we are
[2:06:56] changed. He don't change. But because of
[2:06:59] things that happen,
[2:07:01] isn't that right? There's certain things
[2:07:04] he especially hates. And the last of it
[2:07:07] was someone who sews discord. How many
[2:07:12] know that's what the devil did in Eve?
[2:07:14] He swed
[2:07:15] discord.
[2:07:18] Amen.
[2:07:21] M loves being of one accord.
[2:07:25] Amen. One mind. All right. I I'm going
[2:07:28] to pick that up again in in in First
[2:07:31] Corinthians here in a minute, but I want
[2:07:32] to go back to our thought.
[2:07:37] Looking at that clock, I says it's
[2:07:38] probably already time to go. We may have
[2:07:40] to hold you late again today. Wouldn't
[2:07:43] that be terrible?
[2:07:46] Thank you. Thank you very much. All
[2:07:47] right. All right. It's an abomination.
[2:07:50] How many know Brother says an
[2:07:51] abomination is some smoldering dump that
[2:07:54] stinks of puke and everything else? He
[2:07:56] hates it with a passion. A proud look a
[2:07:58] lion tongue hands that shed innocent
[2:08:01] blood. How many knows if you say
[2:08:04] something bad about somebody, you might
[2:08:06] as well have shot him.
[2:08:09] Watch out. You're a murderer. I wonder
[2:08:11] how many people over there will be
[2:08:14] guilty of murder.
[2:08:18] Well, you know what's going on at
[2:08:19] Evening Night Tabernacle. You know what
[2:08:20] this is, that the other. Go ahead.
[2:08:23] Shoot. You'll answer for it someday.
[2:08:26] Murderer. That's right. Killing the
[2:08:29] influence of somebody.
[2:08:32] That's right.
[2:08:34] Or a heart that devises wicked
[2:08:37] imaginations.
[2:08:40] A heart that devises wicked imagination.
[2:08:43] How many knows
[2:08:46] that the devil devised in heaven wicked
[2:08:50] imaginations?
[2:08:54] In other words, God knows what's in your
[2:08:56] heart.
[2:08:59] A heart, the heart talks about the heart
[2:09:01] that devises it.
[2:09:03] In Isaiah 14 and verse 13 says, "For
[2:09:07] thou hast said, in thine heart,
[2:09:12] in thine heart, I will ascend into
[2:09:15] heaven." He had a absolute wicked
[2:09:19] imagination.
[2:09:22] He devised something that was wicked. We
[2:09:24] deal with it today because of what he
[2:09:26] devised.
[2:09:28] And God hates somebody
[2:09:30] that says one thing and does another.
[2:09:34] Hello. You can say this and you can say
[2:09:37] that, but how many knows God knows why
[2:09:40] you're doing it. He knows the intent of
[2:09:44] your heart.
[2:09:46] We're not hiding it from God.
[2:09:50] You get something in your heart, you
[2:09:51] want a certain way, and you'll do
[2:09:53] anything to get it that way. You better
[2:09:55] watch out. God hates that kind of a
[2:09:57] heart.
[2:09:58] Always be what you are. Amen. Feet
[2:10:03] that are swift to running to mischief
[2:10:06] always into something besides what they
[2:10:09] should be in. A false witness that
[2:10:12] speaketh lies. Amen. A false witness.
[2:10:16] Somebody say something wrong about
[2:10:17] somebody. Ain't that right? God hates
[2:10:19] it. It's also a lie. Once again, that
[2:10:21] lie. And he that sweth discord among
[2:10:26] brethren
[2:10:28] to sow discord.
[2:10:30] How many know discord
[2:10:33] to so that discord brings division?
[2:10:37] It brings confusion.
[2:10:40] It brings variance. It brings emulation,
[2:10:44] wrath and strife.
[2:10:46] Amen.
[2:10:48] How many know God on the other hand he
[2:10:51] come to bring unity to make us one? How
[2:10:56] many believe that? Yes. One mind, one
[2:10:59] soul, one heart, one accord.
[2:11:02] Different ones even talk talked about
[2:11:04] it. God wants you to have the one mind,
[2:11:06] one accord, not a division.
[2:11:10] Amen.
[2:11:13] Praise the Lord.
[2:11:19] In 1 Corinthians 1 and verse 10, Paul
[2:11:22] says, "Now I beseech you, brethren, by
[2:11:24] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
[2:11:25] that ye speak the same thing." Amen.
[2:11:30] That you speak the same thing, and that
[2:11:32] there be no divisions among you.
[2:11:38] Amen.
[2:11:39] and that ye be perfectly joined together
[2:11:42] in the same mind
[2:11:45] and in the same judgment.
[2:11:49] For it has been declared unto me of you,
[2:11:52] my brethren, by them which are of the
[2:11:54] house of Khloe, that there are
[2:11:56] contentions among you. Doesn't the Bible
[2:11:59] say one place there's envy and strife?
[2:12:01] Is there's evil, there's every evil
[2:12:04] work? How many knows God hates jealousy?
[2:12:07] God hates envy. cuz that's what the
[2:12:09] devil had in heaven. He envied him.
[2:12:12] He was jealous of him just like the
[2:12:15] Pharisees were jealous of Jesus because
[2:12:17] everybody was following him
[2:12:20] and they were jealous of him and they
[2:12:22] wanted to kill him because of it.
[2:12:24] Jealousy and envy is a terrible thing.
[2:12:26] Don't never let it come into your heart.
[2:12:30] Amen.
[2:12:32] The devil will try because how many
[2:12:34] knows that's where the devil works is
[2:12:35] try to plant something in your heart.
[2:12:39] sew something in your heart that's not
[2:12:41] supposed to be that be there. Amen.
[2:12:49] And the other thing that it does, what
[2:12:53] disunityity or
[2:12:58] discord does,
[2:13:00] discord,
[2:13:02] it's the opposite of being of one
[2:13:04] accord.
[2:13:07] It's like a fine running machine. Is
[2:13:10] that right? A fine running machine
[2:13:14] and a wrench. Maybe these pulleys are
[2:13:17] just running perfect, but you let a
[2:13:20] piece of steel or something drop into
[2:13:22] there. The teeth fly off, the belt flies
[2:13:26] off, the mean cl the machine clatters,
[2:13:29] bangs, and it just goes to chaos.
[2:13:32] You're like, "Oh my, it was the devil
[2:13:35] did in heaven.
[2:13:37] He brought chaos to heaven."
[2:13:40] That's what you're seeing over there in
[2:13:41] LA. Chaos.
[2:13:44] I told my wife cuz she was kind of
[2:13:45] bothered by that. I said, "Honey, it's
[2:13:46] just another riot. Don't worry about it.
[2:13:49] They did it in the 60s under Luther and
[2:13:51] all of these other Lutheran. They had
[2:13:52] riots. They have riots. They'll never be
[2:13:54] happy.
[2:13:56] There'll be those riots and there'll be
[2:13:58] more riots after that. I'm more
[2:14:00] interested in what God's doing in his
[2:14:02] people. Yes, that is a sign of how that
[2:14:06] like brother Brian said, the the moral
[2:14:08] decay, the nation is falling apart.
[2:14:11] Brother Bram said, the world was falling
[2:14:13] apart. Well, that's what it is. It's
[2:14:14] falling apart.
[2:14:16] I don't want to get political, but it
[2:14:17] comes to my mind how we know that Trump
[2:14:20] won what unanimously by landslide and
[2:14:23] now they want to resist him and they
[2:14:25] don't want to go with it. No, they want
[2:14:26] to, you know, even Walmart owner is part
[2:14:29] of coming against and let's resist
[2:14:31] resist resist. Yeah, you're not I don't
[2:14:34] want to say I want to say you're not
[2:14:35] American. You're not American at all.
[2:14:38] American is if certain ones, well, you
[2:14:39] got to put up with it. We put it up with
[2:14:41] it for four years. We didn't say no
[2:14:43] riot. Hello. So why you got to do that?
[2:14:46] Come on, be American. Wait till the next
[2:14:49] election and then you get your chance
[2:14:51] again. In the meantime, shut up
[2:14:54] and go home.
[2:14:59] Hopefully, they'll arrest them all.
[2:15:02] Hello. Isn't that the truth? Come on.
[2:15:06] You know the American people spoke. You
[2:15:08] can't even put up with that. Sometimes
[2:15:10] we don't want to. I don't want to
[2:15:12] sometimes, but you have to.
[2:15:15] All right. So, order. Let me say this.
[2:15:18] How many knows there was disorder in
[2:15:21] heaven?
[2:15:23] There was disorder.
[2:15:27] And I don't know about you, but I like
[2:15:28] order.
[2:15:30] My wife likes order.
[2:15:33] Amen. And uh the younger we get, I going
[2:15:36] to say that another older word.
[2:15:40] We like our house clean. She likes her
[2:15:42] house clean. She's more specific about
[2:15:45] it cuz man, I'll tell you what, if you
[2:15:46] aren't, you're just cleaning that thing
[2:15:48] all the time. And she gets on to me.
[2:15:50] Hey, you left your socks here. You left
[2:15:53] your cup here. And I want to get
[2:15:55] frustrated. I want to say what?
[2:16:01] But I thought, no, I'm very glad that
[2:16:03] she's like that cuz I like order. I told
[2:16:06] her years ago, I said, "If something
[2:16:07] ain't got a place, then you don't need
[2:16:09] to have it or something. Everything has
[2:16:10] to have its place." Amen. How many knows
[2:16:13] God loves order, the devil loves
[2:16:16] disorder?
[2:16:21] So much so that you know he said for
[2:16:23] children to be in obedience to the
[2:16:25] parents. Isn't that right? Everybody be
[2:16:27] subject one to another. Wives be subject
[2:16:30] to your husbands and all this. Husbands
[2:16:32] love your wives. God loves order. I love
[2:16:35] order. But the devil tries to come and
[2:16:37] bring disorder by discord and division.
[2:16:44] Amen. I'm going to go ahead and say it
[2:16:45] here. It comes to my mind. You know, you
[2:16:48] would have thought that message people
[2:16:50] could have learned from Pentecostals.
[2:16:52] Amen. That separated over whether he was
[2:16:55] coming with a from a cloud or heart. But
[2:16:57] we ain't learned a thing. No, we still
[2:17:00] separate over little issues just that or
[2:17:02] the other. Folks, if you can't get over
[2:17:04] little issues,
[2:17:06] you've got issues.
[2:17:09] That's right. You're just going to have
[2:17:11] an issue if you can't get over those
[2:17:12] little things. Amen. Somebody don't
[2:17:14] shake your hand and you want to go home
[2:17:16] and pout all your hair. Well, all we got
[2:17:17] just go pout then.
[2:17:20] You probably didn't mean nothing by it
[2:17:22] anyway. But no, you're going to have
[2:17:23] your little fit.
[2:17:25] That's right.
[2:17:28] Amen. We got to be grown up. I read it
[2:17:30] just this morning. It's time that the
[2:17:32] tabernacle be grown-ups, not babies.
[2:17:36] We don't want to be babies. Babies petty
[2:17:38] about every little thing.
[2:17:41] Babies still have pride.
[2:17:45] They still have pride in their hearts.
[2:17:52] It has been declared to you of the house
[2:17:54] that there's contentions among you. Now,
[2:17:57] I say this that every one of you says,
[2:17:58] "Well, I'm of Paul. I'm of palace. I'm
[2:18:02] from this church and I'm from that
[2:18:03] church. We go to this church. We got the
[2:18:06] best preacher. We got the best. We got
[2:18:08] this. The greatest this, the greatest
[2:18:09] that. You big bunch of babies.
[2:18:13] Still got pride.
[2:18:16] That's what they did. And Paul said, "Is
[2:18:18] Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for
[2:18:20] you? Or were we baptized in the name of
[2:18:22] Paul?
[2:18:24] I thank God I baptized none of you. But
[2:18:26] of these two, least they should say that
[2:18:28] I baptize in my own name. Amen.
[2:18:32] My
[2:18:36] Where's the other one?
[2:18:41] Where is the other one?
[2:18:51] There it is. Chapter three. that I
[2:18:54] baptize none of you except for these.
[2:18:56] You know, Christ sent me not to baptize
[2:18:58] but to preach the gospel, not with
[2:19:00] wisdom of men's words, lest the cross
[2:19:02] should be made of none afraid. In
[2:19:04] chapter three, he says, "I breed could
[2:19:06] not speak to you as unto carnal, I mean
[2:19:08] spiritual, but as unto carnal." Brother
[2:19:09] Bandham called them babies, even as unto
[2:19:11] babes in Christ. I have fed you with
[2:19:13] milk. In other words, your baby, and not
[2:19:15] me. For hither to you were not able to
[2:19:17] bear it, neither yet now are ye able.
[2:19:21] Are ye not yet carnal? For whereas there
[2:19:23] is among you envying and strife and
[2:19:26] divisions?
[2:19:28] Are ye not carnal and walk as men? For
[2:19:31] one saith, I am of Paul, another of
[2:19:32] Paulus. Brother Bram says that's I
[2:19:35] brother Brand but but Paul says you're
[2:19:37] still carnal. I mean know I don't care
[2:19:41] what church it is, what preacher it is.
[2:19:42] There are brothers and are sisters. We
[2:19:45] are brothers and sisters in this. Amen.
[2:19:48] And one day we're going to spend
[2:19:49] together eternity over there. We're not
[2:19:53] babies anymore. Get that pride out of
[2:19:55] your heart. Get all of those envy, any
[2:19:58] anything. Get that out of your heart.
[2:19:59] Cuz the devil will try his best to get
[2:20:02] bitterness or indifference
[2:20:05] or hatred or variance,
[2:20:09] just some little thing in your heart to
[2:20:12] cause you
[2:20:15] to be depressed.
[2:20:17] How many know depression is of the
[2:20:18] devil? Anxiety is of the devil.
[2:20:23] Being down is of the devil. Praise the
[2:20:27] Lord.
[2:20:29] All right. Can I go a little longer? How
[2:20:32] many knows that God God's children are
[2:20:35] the children of obedience to what God
[2:20:38] says?
[2:20:40] Amen. Those out there, they have no
[2:20:42] order. They don't care about law. They
[2:20:43] don't care about order of any kind.
[2:20:46] Hello. But God's children do. But the
[2:20:49] Bible said they are children of
[2:20:51] disobedience.
[2:20:53] How many know in our house we like
[2:20:55] order?
[2:20:58] Amen. It's been said, you know, they
[2:20:59] used to not count to one, two, three,
[2:21:01] four.
[2:21:04] Amen. It was like, I told you. And when
[2:21:07] you you might have reminded them and
[2:21:10] then after the I told you, you and I
[2:21:12] would have a soul saver in our house.
[2:21:15] That's right. I wrote on our big old
[2:21:17] paddle, soul saver. The Bible says,
[2:21:19] "Spare the rod and spoil the child. Thou
[2:21:22] won't kill him. Just try not to quite
[2:21:24] kill him." Okay,
[2:21:28] folks. It's a good thing, Sister Hannah,
[2:21:30] sometimes that we don't take brother
[2:21:31] Brandham literal.
[2:21:34] How many know she says I would my
[2:21:35] daughter would to come out with her
[2:21:36] whole clothes this that the other. She
[2:21:38] wouldn't get up for two weeks or
[2:21:39] something like that. Get up for two
[2:21:42] weeks. She couldn't get around. It was
[2:21:44] rough. Go read some of them quotes,
[2:21:46] folks.
[2:21:48] Three quarter dead.
[2:21:55] They'd be scared to death to do
[2:21:57] something wrong. But no, we count to
[2:21:59] two, two and a half, three, three and a
[2:22:01] half, four or four. You know, come on
[2:22:04] people. Why do you make yourself
[2:22:06] miserable? You're the one that trains
[2:22:08] them. You're the trainer and you train
[2:22:10] them to make you miserable. No, don't do
[2:22:12] that.
[2:22:16] Amen. We love order. They don't want to
[2:22:18] obey. Not I want to obey what God said.
[2:22:20] How many know better says every
[2:22:22] obedience to every word of God entitles
[2:22:24] you to the token.
[2:22:27] I'm here to tell you the prophet of God
[2:22:28] came to give us a word to get us back to
[2:22:31] what Eve disobeyed disbelief. We're not
[2:22:34] going to disobey or disbelieve the word
[2:22:37] of God. Not one word. Why? Then you're
[2:22:40] protected from the enemy. The devil
[2:22:42] can't come in here and poke nothing in
[2:22:44] there cuz he sure will try. I want to
[2:22:49] finish a quote where he said, you know,
[2:22:51] uh
[2:22:52] um let me see here. Satan will
[2:22:56] constantly punch at you until you're
[2:22:57] finished. Before he said that, he says,
[2:22:59] "Don't you ever let a little ism Hello.
[2:23:03] I mean know the devil is the god of isms
[2:23:08] or something another a little bad
[2:23:10] feeling ever arise among you. Hello. How
[2:23:14] many knows? You got to watch that. It's
[2:23:15] easy to let some little bad feeling
[2:23:18] towards somebody arise in your heart.
[2:23:23] How many has ever done it?
[2:23:27] I'll raise my hand.
[2:23:31] I'll raise both hands.
[2:23:34] I'll raise a foot.
[2:23:38] Two feet.
[2:23:40] Sure. Why? You're human. We have those
[2:23:44] things that happen. And that's the
[2:23:45] devil's avenue to bring division in the
[2:23:48] church. Hallelujah. I trust it ain't
[2:23:51] nowhere right now. If it is, we've got
[2:23:53] to rope and say, "God, brother Bible, I
[2:23:55] want that out of my life. I don't want
[2:23:57] no ism. I don't want no bad feelings. We
[2:24:00] all know what those bad feelings are. Or
[2:24:02] those little funny feelings.
[2:24:05] A little bad feeling ever rise among
[2:24:07] you. Get it out of there right now.
[2:24:10] Amen. Hit the little fox and grapes. So
[2:24:13] keep it out of the way. Any little funny
[2:24:15] feeling, go tell that person, I'm wrong.
[2:24:19] I don't feel right towards you or
[2:24:22] something. Help me and pray over it that
[2:24:24] I get better. Oh my. And I'm here to
[2:24:26] tell you if we could ever do that, if we
[2:24:28] could ever realize that if you have a
[2:24:30] bad feeling or you have the problem with
[2:24:32] somebody, go to that person say, "I need
[2:24:34] to get it right." And you both come to
[2:24:36] the altar, I'm here to tear things and
[2:24:38] get straightened up. The Holy Spirit
[2:24:40] would come and forgive and you'd walk
[2:24:41] out as brothers.
[2:24:44] That's the way the sevil differences
[2:24:46] under the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:24:53] That's right.
[2:24:55] that I'll get better because we don't
[2:24:57] want nothing but just purely
[2:24:59] unadulterated Holy Spirit of God among
[2:25:01] us.
[2:25:03] Prophet says it best. That's what we
[2:25:05] want. Then the gifts and things will
[2:25:07] work right and everything will be coming
[2:25:09] and right. Oh, don't you just love us
[2:25:11] smooth? Something that runs smoothly.
[2:25:14] It's where the Holy Spirit had the
[2:25:16] preeminence in the church. Not no ism,
[2:25:19] not no funny feelings. All clear.
[2:25:21] Nothing between my soul and my savior.
[2:25:24] Amen. Amen. Let nothing between. Don't
[2:25:28] let nothing come in between you. Why
[2:25:30] have half a church when you can have a
[2:25:31] whole one? Why accept a substitute when
[2:25:34] the whole skies are full of the genuine?
[2:25:36] Amen. We don't want that. So if a little
[2:25:38] funny feeling ever comes up among you
[2:25:41] with the you members one to another, you
[2:25:43] go to that person. Amen. Praise the
[2:25:46] Lord. Then he says constantly the devil
[2:25:48] will always try. He'll always keep
[2:25:50] trying.
[2:25:51] Amen.
[2:25:53] In closing, Brother Bam says, "Stay
[2:25:55] right together." If you think he's a
[2:25:58] little wrong or a sister, say, "Lord,
[2:26:00] don't never let me get a root of
[2:26:01] bitterness springing up."
[2:26:04] What is it? It's the devil that wants to
[2:26:06] bring discord. God hates it.
[2:26:10] Amen. Just that little. He told Eve,
[2:26:13] just that little something.
[2:26:16] That's all he wants.
[2:26:18] That's right. Say, "Lord, don't ever let
[2:26:20] me have a root of bitterness spring up
[2:26:21] because it'll affect him and it'll take
[2:26:23] Christ right out of my life."
[2:26:31] All right, I might as well say it. Comes
[2:26:34] to mind. How many has ever got mad at
[2:26:36] your wife?
[2:26:41] Well, that's pretty lately, but that's
[2:26:43] all right. Well, the blood of Jesus
[2:26:45] Christ is still good. That's right. I
[2:26:48] you know we could probably all say our
[2:26:50] hand. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:26:52] And you know the feeling that you get
[2:26:55] when you do. Hello. In other words, it
[2:27:00] got to you,
[2:27:03] the devil got to you.
[2:27:07] Cuz the second the temper sink second
[2:27:09] the temper comes in, the Holy Spirit
[2:27:11] leaves.
[2:27:14] I'm sorry, but this is not how the Holy
[2:27:15] Spirit looks.
[2:27:20] He don't look that way.
[2:27:26] Nope. That's not the Holy Ghost. He done
[2:27:29] left. Look more like a wolf.
[2:27:34] Teeth, man. Why? Sure. That ain't
[2:27:37] canines in there.
[2:27:42] That's right. But the Holy Spirit just
[2:27:44] leaves.
[2:27:45] Amen. You realize, "Oh, I shouldn't have
[2:27:47] done it."
[2:27:49] Amen. What did I say? Husbands got mad
[2:27:52] at your wives. What about wives getting
[2:27:54] mad at your husbands?
[2:27:59] Man, I told him. I told him. Hey, my
[2:28:02] wife's got mad at me several times.
[2:28:06] And I hate to admit it, but she had to
[2:28:09] just call us
[2:28:12] cuz I'm a man and we're not because I'm
[2:28:15] not always as thoughtful as what I
[2:28:17] should be. Hello,
[2:28:20] aren't we? We're just a little more
[2:28:21] burly.
[2:28:23] Ah, that garbage will be all right. Next
[2:28:25] morning's scattered everywhere.
[2:28:28] But whatever it might be, but you've
[2:28:30] probably experienced where you just
[2:28:32] don't have that sweet feeling in your
[2:28:34] heart anymore.
[2:28:36] Amen.
[2:28:39] I hope that you men have gotten smart
[2:28:41] enough to learn that if you got to fuss
[2:28:43] with your wife, you should be the man of
[2:28:44] the house and go ahead and apologize
[2:28:46] first before she does. Hurry up.
[2:28:51] Huh?
[2:28:53] That's right. Me the man in the house.
[2:28:55] Say, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got upset.
[2:28:58] I'm sorry I upset you." Because how many
[2:29:01] know it's a quick wave? Hello. Devil
[2:29:04] gets in marriages,
[2:29:06] boy. He gets in marriages and divides
[2:29:09] marriages because of feelings and
[2:29:11] unrepentitiveness and stubbornness and
[2:29:14] all that stuff.
[2:29:17] Amen.
[2:29:19] Brothers and sisters, it's a late hour.
[2:29:21] The devil will try to get in and make
[2:29:23] you miserable any way that he can. How
[2:29:26] many know that's the devil's objective
[2:29:28] is to make you as miserable as he is.
[2:29:33] I want to stick my tongue out at him
[2:29:34] almost and say, "You just be miserable.
[2:29:37] I'm not going to be miserable. So get
[2:29:39] away from me, devil." Right. Boo, devil,
[2:29:43] get away.
[2:29:50] That's right. Listen, he says, "That's
[2:29:52] right. It'll just take the Holy Spirit
[2:29:53] right away from you just to have that
[2:29:55] little rooe of bitterness, just to know
[2:29:57] that somebody isn't quite right." Right.
[2:29:59] Brother Ram says if you don't if you
[2:30:01] think he's a little wrong or he did you
[2:30:03] a little wrong or said something a
[2:30:05] little wrong. Hello.
[2:30:08] Be big. Be big. He didn't mean that. How
[2:30:13] many knows those those preachers sitting
[2:30:15] behind Brother Brandwood said, "Man, I
[2:30:16] had all kinds of thoughts coming at me.
[2:30:19] All kinds of terrible thoughts coming at
[2:30:21] me." He says, "They were just
[2:30:23] ricocheting off of me." You know what he
[2:30:25] said? They ricocheted off of me. Why?
[2:30:28] They tried to hit him and he just
[2:30:29] shugged him off. Those brothers back
[2:30:31] there, they caught it maybe and like
[2:30:33] where did that come from?
[2:30:37] Amen. I wanted to do a little study, but
[2:30:39] I'm here to tell you that when you sit
[2:30:41] back there with resentment, you're
[2:30:42] asking for a devil to get on you. You
[2:30:45] sit there with resentment and hatred and
[2:30:48] little bit of ah, you watch out, folks.
[2:30:50] It's a bad thing to do. People have
[2:30:52] dropped over dead because of it. Amen.
[2:30:55] Because the Holy Spirit knows exactly
[2:30:57] what our attitudes towards the word of
[2:30:58] God is.
[2:31:00] So he says, "Listen,
[2:31:04] that's right. It'll just take the Holy
[2:31:06] Spirit right away from you. It'll run
[2:31:08] him from the tabernacle here. It'll kill
[2:31:11] the spirit of God and drive it away from
[2:31:13] here. Hurt your pastor. It'll do
[2:31:16] everything. Don't you do that. You just
[2:31:18] wax that much closer together." And
[2:31:20] that's my message for the church this
[2:31:22] morning. Let's draw a little closer
[2:31:25] together. Let's have more love one for
[2:31:27] another, more compassion one for
[2:31:29] another. And the more the devil tries to
[2:31:32] get at you and make you miserable, the
[2:31:34] more you get closer to one another. And
[2:31:36] block the devil out. Are you with me
[2:31:38] this morning? Block the devil out. He
[2:31:40] ain't got no way. He's got to have
[2:31:42] somebody to work through. And he's not
[2:31:44] working through us. Why? Because he's
[2:31:47] under our feet. And we're going to keep
[2:31:48] him under our feet. Out of our minds.
[2:31:51] We're going to keep him out of our mind.
[2:31:53] He's out of our heart. We're going to
[2:31:54] keep him out of our heart. Amen. We're
[2:31:56] going to live for Jesus. Amen. He come
[2:31:58] to give us life and more abundantly, joy
[2:32:01] unspeakable and full of glory.
[2:32:07] There ain't no way you'll ever break
[2:32:09] those chains of the devil. You'll never
[2:32:11] break them outside of the power of the
[2:32:13] Holy Ghost. Cuz you are born with that
[2:32:16] nature, born with those things, born
[2:32:18] with them devils. Amen. And only the
[2:32:20] Holy Spirit can break that.
[2:32:24] Only Jesus can break us from those
[2:32:26] things.
[2:32:28] You feel for people that are chained.
[2:32:31] Stand with me this morning.
[2:32:33] Thank you, Lord. Musicians, if you'll
[2:32:34] come.
[2:32:36] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:32:42] God is good, isn't he?
[2:32:45] How many that loves a God that has given
[2:32:47] us a way of escape?
[2:32:49] You've overcome this. You've overcome
[2:32:51] the world. You've overcome the devil.
[2:32:53] How did John say? He says, "By the faith
[2:32:55] that you've got in your heart." We
[2:32:57] overcome the devil by faith. By
[2:32:59] believing in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:33:00] That's the only way we overcome. Amen.
[2:33:02] Is having faith in the word of God.
[2:33:05] We're privileged people this morning,
[2:33:06] aren't we?
[2:33:08] God bless you.
[2:33:12] with heads bowed,
[2:33:15] a moment of an altar call. Let's not
[2:33:18] rush it. Prophet surely didn't. Is there
[2:33:22] any that would want to have a moment of
[2:33:24] prayer? I'll pray with you if you want.
[2:33:27] Maybe you're depressed. Maybe the
[2:33:28] devil's got you down. Maybe some of the
[2:33:30] things that I've mentioned has affected
[2:33:32] you and you want to get rid of it here
[2:33:35] and now. You want to say, "God, I want
[2:33:37] peace in my heart. I want love in my
[2:33:39] heart. I don't want no bitterness. I
[2:33:41] don't want to be miserable. I don't want
[2:33:42] any of those things in my life. This
[2:33:45] morning, I'm saying, Lord Jesus, give me
[2:33:46] your faith. Give me your life. Don't let
[2:33:49] me Don't let the devil make me
[2:33:50] miserable.
[2:33:53] God bless that hand. God bless that
[2:33:55] hand. God bless you. God bless you. God
[2:33:57] bless you. Lord Jesus, we raise our
[2:33:59] hands, Lord Jesus. And sometimes we
[2:34:01] fail. Sometimes we falter. We let things
[2:34:04] like that happen. But God, I pray that
[2:34:06] you will cause us to grow into maturity,
[2:34:09] Lord Jesus, to where we have control of
[2:34:10] our emotions, control of our affections,
[2:34:12] Lord, that the devil doesn't go in there
[2:34:14] and cause a little thought to come in, a
[2:34:17] little feeling to come in that is not
[2:34:18] like you. That we wouldn't have the
[2:34:21] right feeling, Lord Jesus. Perhaps a
[2:34:22] little bit of bitterness come in,
[2:34:24] Father, and we would sit there, Lord
[2:34:26] Jesus, and be miserable, God. I pray
[2:34:28] every hand that has went up. You see
[2:34:30] what's beneath that hand. Deliver now,
[2:34:32] Lord, as we surrender and commit
[2:34:33] ourselves to you, accepting everything
[2:34:36] you have said, obeying every command
[2:34:38] you've given, Lord, for we love you. You
[2:34:41] said, "If you love me, keep my
[2:34:42] commandments." And Lord, that's what we
[2:34:44] desire to do, Lord, to be in order, not
[2:34:46] to get out of order, Lord, but just to
[2:34:48] be where you want us to be. Live the way
[2:34:50] you want us to live, Lord, and stay
[2:34:52] fortified behind the word of God. Bless
[2:34:54] every heart now. We ask it in Jesus
[2:34:56] name. Amen. And amen. God bless you.
[2:35:00] Amen. Happy Father's Day to all of you
[2:35:03] fathers. May God
[2:35:06] help you to be a better father. How many
[2:35:10] wants to be a better father. I want to
[2:35:13] be a better father. I want to be a
[2:35:14] better grandpa and a happy grandpa, too.
[2:35:18] Everybody that's grandpa. I don't get to
[2:35:20] have a grandpa day. So, we're going to
[2:35:21] have a grandpa day. It's the same day as
[2:35:24] daddy day. All right, father and
[2:35:26] grandfather. God bless you. Amen. As you
[2:35:28] spoil them children rotten. No.
[2:35:34] Well, brother said, you know, God's not
[2:35:36] a dirty old grandpa. You know, I guess
[2:35:38] he said grandpas tend to be doy with
[2:35:40] them grandkids, but Amen. You just keep
[2:35:43] the balance. Ain't that right? God bless
[2:35:45] you. We love you. Amen. God richly bless
[2:35:47] you. May God help us all. I'm praying
[2:35:50] this for myself. Lord, help me to be
[2:35:52] better, closer to God, and more like him
[2:35:55] all the way around. How many is with me?
[2:35:56] Lord, help me to be a better Christian
[2:35:58] all the way around. Amen. And it's it's
[2:36:01] time. It's time that we buckle up the
[2:36:03] armor. Like brother Ram said, buckle the
[2:36:04] armor up, wax that much closer, and keep
[2:36:06] the enemy out. Amen. God bless you.
[2:36:09] Amen. Love the Lord this morning. Amen.
[2:36:12] How many enjoyed that? Let's give the
[2:36:13] Lord a hand of praise. Amen.
[2:36:16] Amen.
[2:36:19] Amen.
[2:36:21] Amen.
[2:36:22] Amen. Let's sing that little chorus
[2:36:25] before we go. Lord, prepare me to be a
[2:36:27] sanctuary this morning. Oh Lord, prepare
[2:36:32] me
[2:36:34] to be a sanctuary.
[2:36:42] Pure and holy,
[2:36:48] tried and true.
[2:36:50] [Music]
[2:36:53] And with thanksgiving
[2:36:59] I'll be a livinging
[2:37:04] [Music]
[2:37:06] sanctuary
[2:37:11] for you once again this morning.
[2:37:16] Oh Lord, prepare
[2:37:20] me
[2:37:22] to be a sanctuary,
[2:37:26] [Music]
[2:37:29] pure and holy,
[2:37:34] [Music]
[2:37:35] tried and true,
[2:37:38] [Music]
[2:37:41] with thanksgiving.
[2:37:46] I'll be a livinging
[2:37:51] [Music]
[2:37:53] sanctuary
[2:37:59] for you.
[2:38:03] And the more that I
[2:38:07] surrender,
[2:38:08] [Music]
[2:38:10] the lighter
[2:38:13] my Lord.
[2:38:17] The more that I
[2:38:20] release my cares,
[2:38:24] the more he takes control.
[2:38:27] [Music]
[2:38:30] The more that I can humble myself,
[2:38:37] the more he lifts me up.
[2:38:42] Every day I leave.
[2:38:47] Lord, I love
[2:38:50] you more.
[2:38:55] Amen. Amen. And we can say it's been
[2:38:57] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[2:38:59] morning. Amen. Remember the service
[2:39:02] Wednesday night at 7:00 and come hungry
[2:39:06] and you'll be fed. Amen. And as we go
[2:39:09] this morning, let's sing that old song.
[2:39:11] Ain't God good to give us so many
[2:39:14] blessings? Undeserving. That's what we
[2:39:17] are. But we ought to thank him. Well,
[2:39:20] ain't God good? God bless you to
