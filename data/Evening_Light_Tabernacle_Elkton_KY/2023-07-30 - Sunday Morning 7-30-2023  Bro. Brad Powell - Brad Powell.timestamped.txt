[43:18] we need encouraging I need encouraging
[43:21] you you guys might be living above where
[43:25] I am but
[43:26] I think we all sometimes need
[43:27] encouraging
[43:28] uh
[43:30] so the god hold him here pretty uh just
[43:33] not it wasn't very much notice they had
[43:36] but
[43:36] I was just going to go uh to Matthew if
[43:39] you go with me to Matthew
[43:41] 24
[43:42] keep
[43:45] scripture
[43:47] portion of scripture you're here it's
[43:49] Matthew 24 it keeps coming back to me a
[43:52] lot but we'll just start reading through
[43:53] here
[43:54] let's listen to Brethren
[43:56] a little bit this morning actually it
[43:59] was on
[44:00] Gabriel Gabriel's instruction to Daniel
[44:04] and he was saying in there
[44:06] which we know the world we live in it's
[44:07] dark world it's not a not a nice place
[44:10] to live as far as um
[44:13] the world is dark
[44:15] but as a you know uh Abraham and Sarah
[44:18] were pilgrims and Were Strangers my
[44:21] brother Brandon was saying in this
[44:22] message he was saying how Daniel got
[44:24] taken he said at age 13 around 13 or 14
[44:27] he got taken
[44:30] uh and to a foreign land a heathenland
[44:34] and where nobody believes like he did
[44:37] nobody sang songs like he did nobody was
[44:40] like him but he kept the faith he kept
[44:42] in the scripture he kept in the work for
[44:44] his day he said he was
[44:46] studying books and uh that's where this
[44:50] uh scr or message came from Gabriel's
[44:52] instruction to Daniel
[44:54] but uh how he kept himself faithful to
[44:58] what God had called for him to be he
[45:00] said and when brother Brown was
[45:01] mentioned he said 68 years he kept him
[45:03] so nobody believed like he did it was
[45:06] just him
[45:07] but anyway here in Matthew we're going
[45:09] uh to Matthew 24 we'll just start in
[45:12] there where Jesus is
[45:14] speaking to the disciples
[45:17] and Jesus went out and departed from the
[45:19] temple and his disciples came unto him
[45:21] for to show him the
[45:24] done left upon another and as he said
[45:26] upon
[45:27] the Mount of Olives the disciples came
[45:29] unto him
[45:31] privately seen tell us when shall these
[45:34] things be and what shall be the sign of
[45:36] thy coming and of the end of the world
[45:40] Jesus answered and said for
[45:44] many shall come in my name saying I am
[45:46] Christ and shall deceive many
[45:49] and he shall hear and ye shall hear of
[45:51] wars and rumors of wars see that you'd
[45:53] be not troubled for all these things
[45:55] must come to pass but the end is not yet
[45:58] said for nation shall rise against
[46:00] Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there
[46:03] shall be famines pestilence and
[46:06] earthquakes in diverse places
[46:09] and all these things are the beginning
[46:10] of Sorrows then shall they deliver you
[46:13] up to be afflicted and shall kill you
[46:15] and you shall be hated of all Nations
[46:17] for my name's sake and then it shall
[46:20] many be offended and shall betray one
[46:22] another and shall hate one another and
[46:25] many false prophets shall rise and shall
[46:27] deceive many
[46:28] and because of iniquity shall abound the
[46:31] love of many shall wax cold
[46:34] but he that shall endure unto the end
[46:36] the same shall the same shall be saved
[46:38] and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be
[46:40] preached in all the world for witness
[46:42] unto all nations and then shall the End
[46:45] come
[46:46] when ye therefore see the abomination of
[46:49] desolation spoken of by Daniel the
[46:52] Prophet stand in the Holy place
[46:54] whosoever let him understand
[46:57] then let them which be in Judea flee
[46:59] into the mountains let him which
[47:02] is on the housetop not come down to take
[47:05] anything out of his house neither let
[47:08] him that which is in the field return
[47:09] back to take his clothes
[47:12] and woe unto them that are with child
[47:14] unto them that give suck in those days
[47:16] but pray ye that your flight be not in
[47:18] the winter neither on the Sabbath day
[47:20] for then shall be Great Tribulation such
[47:23] as was not since the beginning of the
[47:25] world to this time nor ever shall be
[47:28] and except those days should be
[47:30] shortened there should no flesh be saved
[47:33] but for the elect's sake those days
[47:35] shall be shortened
[47:37] and if anyone shall say unto you Lo
[47:39] hears Christ or there leave it not for
[47:42] there shall arise false Christ false
[47:45] prophets
[47:46] and shall show great signs and wonders
[47:48] in so much that if it were possible they
[47:50] shall deceive the very elect
[47:52] behold I have told you before
[47:55] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[47:57] behold he is in the desert gone off for
[48:00] neither is he in this treat Secret
[48:04] for as the lightning cometh out of the
[48:06] East and even unto the West so shall
[48:09] also the coming of the son of man be for
[48:11] Weather Service the car forever
[48:13] wheresoever the carcass is there shall
[48:15] the Eagles be gathered together
[48:17] immediately after the tribulation of
[48:20] those days shall the sun be darkened and
[48:22] the moon shall not give her light the
[48:24] Stars shall fall from Heaven and the
[48:26] powers of Heaven shall be shaken
[48:28] and then shall appear the son of the son
[48:29] of man in heaven and then shall all the
[48:31] tribes of the earth mourn they shall see
[48:33] the son of man coming in the Clouds Of
[48:35] Heaven with power and great Glory you
[48:38] shall send his angels with the Great
[48:39] Sound of the trumpet and they shall
[48:40] gather together his elect from the Four
[48:42] Winds from one end to heaven to the
[48:44] other
[48:45] he says now learn the parable of the Fig
[48:47] Tree when his when his branch is yet
[48:50] tender
[48:51] puteth forth leaves he known that summer
[48:55] is nigh so likewise ye when you shall
[48:57] see all these things know that it is
[48:59] near even at the door
[49:01] brother said the the children of Israel
[49:04] were pushed back into their Homeland for
[49:05] that purpose
[49:06] rarely I say unto you this generation
[49:08] shall not pass through all these things
[49:10] be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass
[49:12] away
[49:13] but my words shall not pass away
[49:16] but of that day and hour knoweth no man
[49:19] not no not the angels of heaven but my
[49:23] father only
[49:25] he keeps going on here he says
[49:28] but as the days of Noah were so it shall
[49:32] also be the coming of the son of man B
[49:34] for as in the days that were before the
[49:37] flood they were eating and drinking
[49:39] now just say no in your personal lives
[49:42] look at what's going on in the world for
[49:44] us in the days that were before the
[49:45] flood they were eating and drinking
[49:46] marrying giving in marriage until the
[49:49] day that Noah entered into the ark
[49:51] they were living just their normal lives
[49:53] they were working doing whatever they
[49:55] had to do and they knew not until the
[49:56] flood came and took them all away so
[49:58] shall also the coming of the seven man
[50:00] be
[50:01] then shall UV in the field and one shall
[50:03] be taken and the other left two women
[50:05] shall be grinding at the meal one shall
[50:07] be taken the other left watch therefore
[50:09] for you know not whether
[50:10] for you know not what hour your Lord
[50:12] doeth come
[50:13] but know this that if the good man of
[50:15] the house had known it
[50:18] well watch the thief would come he would
[50:20] have watched and would not have suffered
[50:22] his house to be broken up
[50:24] therefore be also read ready
[50:28] for in such an hour as you think not the
[50:31] son of man cometh who then is a faithful
[50:34] and wise servant whom his Lord hath made
[50:36] ruler over his household to give them
[50:38] meat in due season
[50:40] blessed is that servant whom is Lord
[50:43] when he cometh
[50:44] shall find so doing
[50:46] verily I say unto you that he shall make
[50:49] him ruler over all his Goods
[50:51] the evil servant Chastain is hard
[50:54] but if the evil spirit shall seen it
[50:57] hurt my Lord Do It delay is coming
[51:00] well we're in that stage where man's
[51:03] basically saying he is delaying his
[51:05] coming and a lot of people are saying
[51:06] there is no such thing as even a god
[51:09] and shall begin to Smite his fellow
[51:11] servants and to eat and drink with the
[51:12] drunkards the lord of the that servant
[51:14] shall come in a day when you looketh not
[51:16] for him and in an hour that he is not
[51:18] aware
[51:19] and she'll cut a misunder and appoint
[51:21] him with his poor his portion with the
[51:23] Hypocrites there shall be weeping and
[51:25] gnashing of teeth
[51:27] and he keeps going here in the next uh
[51:30] chapter
[51:31] like and The Virgins and the ten virgins
[51:34] but
[51:35] it's just Jesus pointing us to to us and
[51:38] telling us what it's going to be like
[51:41] when he when he's coming back and if you
[51:43] look around
[51:44] you can see these scriptures being
[51:46] fulfilled today
[51:48] in our in our life and what's going on
[51:50] in the world
[51:53] uh that's how it I had another um
[51:58] I don't know if I can find that one I
[52:00] had another quote here about
[52:03] but basically what's really what I'm
[52:05] saying you know the hardest
[52:07] he was saying that America needs uh
[52:11] needs uh people to be testimonies you
[52:14] know uh
[52:16] um missionaries basically and he was
[52:18] saying that it's harder to uh to for uh
[52:23] educated heed than what she was what he
[52:26] called Amer a lot of Americans educated
[52:28] Heathen to accept God and what's God's
[52:30] done in this day then for a non-educated
[52:33] heathen
[52:34] but if you look out there that's what
[52:37] all the churches they become they do
[52:40] they do their own thing they do whatever
[52:42] seems right I guess unto them or they
[52:45] take a man's ideas again over what God
[52:47] had said in the scriptures and what was
[52:49] brought out in our day
[52:50] and this is from that same uh message
[52:53] here Gabriel's instruction to Daniel
[52:54] brother Adam said oh God if there ever
[52:57] was a time that we ought to be setting
[52:58] ourselves in order
[53:00] to pray it's now for we as his true
[53:03] servant we see by the letters of the
[53:05] Apostles by the warnings of the holy
[53:07] spirit that were in the last days
[53:10] the Holy Spirit speaks that in the last
[53:12] days men will be heady high-minded
[53:15] lovers of pleasure more than of God
[53:17] truce Breakers false accusers
[53:20] incontinent those that are good I
[53:24] understand it he said by the letter
[53:27] and you can see that in the in the media
[53:31] and all these things despise
[53:33] of those that do good it's not just good
[53:36] enough for them
[53:38] but uh to not do good but now they're
[53:42] despisers of those that do good they
[53:44] have a grudge or an uh something against
[53:47] you because you try to live a Christian
[53:49] Life
[53:50] but remember says and I understand that
[53:52] there will come scoffers in the last
[53:53] days
[53:55] I understand that there will be a
[53:56] nations against Nations
[53:58] and reflect this on the life and the day
[54:01] that we're in right now think about
[54:02] what's going on in the world nations
[54:04] against nations in the last day I
[54:07] understand there will be a tidal waves
[54:09] waves in the last days I understand that
[54:12] will be fearful sights like flying
[54:15] saucers
[54:16] just I think
[54:18] I read a little news clip uh some sort
[54:22] of hearing and some sort of uh
[54:24] discussions about UFOs
[54:26] I've never before that I ever known that
[54:29] Congress would go talk about come meet
[54:32] together and talk about UFOs what can be
[54:34] done about UFOs
[54:36] flying saucers in the heavens mysterious
[54:39] sites
[54:40] Brotherman says men's Hearts will be
[54:42] failing for fear it'll be perplexity of
[54:45] time and distress amongst the people I
[54:47] read that that they'll go into
[54:48] organization
[54:50] things and denominations and have a
[54:52] confederation in the last day I
[54:54] understand that women will Bob off their
[54:56] hair in the last day understand their
[54:57] well shorts clothes you know short close
[55:00] and walk with high heel shoes tinkling
[55:02] as they oh he said in the last days I
[55:06] understand that the morale will be very
[55:07] low in the last days look at the morale
[55:10] of the people yeah yeah very low it's
[55:13] really really low it's a to a set a
[55:15] point of being sad
[55:19] I understand that the preachers will be
[55:21] false shepherds in the last days look at
[55:23] the denominational preachers
[55:25] false Shepherds they're yeah terrible
[55:28] false Shepherds
[55:30] Gathering to their own self riches
[55:33] but they can't and he goes on to say
[55:35] last days they'll compromise yep they've
[55:37] compromised and will not feed the people
[55:39] the word of God
[55:40] but we'll go after Creeds and things
[55:42] instead but I understand there will be a
[55:44] voice and this is where brother bear
[55:46] this is where we come in but I
[55:48] understand there will be a voice come in
[55:50] the last days crying out falling to the
[55:52] people back to the original message back
[55:55] to the things of God I understand by the
[55:57] book those things will take place he
[56:00] says I understand that in the last days
[56:01] there will come a famine the churches
[56:03] will be so organized and so set to
[56:06] everything in the last days there will
[56:08] become a famine that it will not be for
[56:10] bread and water only
[56:12] but for hearing the true word of God and
[56:15] people will go from the eat
[56:17] system
[56:20] request from the North and the South
[56:21] nope that they'll fail to hear
[56:24] I understand
[56:26] that by the book
[56:28] s but in that day oh God they're in
[56:31] Elijah before that they become
[56:34] an end and he will have to have a
[56:37] message that will turn the hearts of the
[56:39] children back to the faith of the
[56:40] fathers
[56:41] to the original go back to again to the
[56:45] end and start I understand that it will
[56:47] take place just before the spirit leaves
[56:49] Gentile church and returns unto the Jews
[56:52] and that was out of the um Gabriel's
[56:54] instruction to Daniel
[56:56] well we're right on the verge of that my
[56:58] friend so if anything
[57:02] as uh the scripture says look up your
[57:05] Redemption draw nigh

[1:31:57] brother Brown said do you realize that
[1:31:59] you're sons of God
[1:32:00] the atmosphere and the air that you live
[1:32:03] in you create a situation around you
[1:32:06] that either draws
[1:32:08] you're pulling God in
[1:32:10] or you're pushing it away
[1:32:12] one of those two things you're either
[1:32:14] drawing on God or you're pushing God
[1:32:16] away he said we ought to get ourselves
[1:32:18] in that kind of atmosphere create each
[1:32:21] one of you is a creator
[1:32:23] did you know that each one of you people
[1:32:26] that's born again
[1:32:28] is a Creator we must create an
[1:32:31] atmosphere
[1:32:33] amen turn with me in the scriptures if
[1:32:35] you would to Genesis this chapter one
[1:32:41] Genesis chapter 1
[1:32:45] like I said I feel completely
[1:32:49] in tune
[1:32:50] with the songs that we're saying in the
[1:32:52] way
[1:32:53] things have
[1:32:55] come about and transpired and so I'm
[1:32:59] ready to uh to
[1:33:02] Genesis chapter one in the beginning God
[1:33:05] created the Heaven and the Earth
[1:33:08] and the Earth was without form and void
[1:33:10] and the Darkness was upon the face of
[1:33:12] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:33:14] upon the face of the waters and God said
[1:33:17] let there be light and there was light
[1:33:19] and God saw the light that it was good
[1:33:22] and God divided the light from the
[1:33:24] darkness and God called the light day
[1:33:27] and the Darkness he called night and the
[1:33:30] evening in the morning were the first
[1:33:31] day turn with me into Revelations if you
[1:33:34] would chapter 21.
[1:33:38] we're going to start at the beginning
[1:33:40] and end at the end
[1:33:42] I'm not going to cover everything in
[1:33:43] between I promise
[1:33:48] Revelations chapter 21.
[1:33:51] and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[1:33:54] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[1:33:56] were passed away and there was no more
[1:33:58] sea and I John saw the holy city a New
[1:34:02] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:34:05] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:34:08] her husband
[1:34:10] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[1:34:12] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[1:34:16] with men
[1:34:17] and he will dwell with them aren't you
[1:34:20] happy he will dwell with them and they
[1:34:23] shall be his people and God himself
[1:34:26] shall be with them and be their God what
[1:34:29] a beautiful scene
[1:34:31] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[1:34:34] their eyes
[1:34:36] there shall be no more death neither
[1:34:37] sorrow nor crying neither shall there be
[1:34:40] any more pain for the former things are
[1:34:43] passed away
[1:34:44] and he that set upon the throne said
[1:34:46] behold I make all things new and he said
[1:34:50] unto me right for these words are true
[1:34:53] and faithful and he said unto me it is
[1:34:56] done
[1:34:57] it's done say it with me it is done
[1:35:02] I'm the alpha the of Life freely say
[1:35:06] inherit
[1:35:08] inherit all things and I will be his God
[1:35:12] and he shall be my son
[1:35:14] may the Lord that is blessings to the
[1:35:16] reading of the word you may be seated
[1:35:21] I want to speak to you
[1:35:23] King
[1:35:25] Dom Builder
[1:35:28] Kingdom Builders
[1:35:30] in the message secondhand robe the
[1:35:32] prophet says when mankind the sons of
[1:35:35] Adam were backed into a corner diseases
[1:35:38] afflictions and sin canker in them
[1:35:40] eating them driving them to hell like
[1:35:42] taskmasters the devil has broke

[1:36:21] this little natural people with nothing
[1:36:23] they could do
[1:36:25] watch this then in heaven something took
[1:36:29] place
[1:36:31] then in heaven something took place
[1:36:33] Adam's people was backed into a corner
[1:36:36] when you and I find ourselves brothers
[1:36:38] and sisters backed into a corner
[1:36:40] something in heaven takes place he said
[1:36:43] there was one that stepped out called
[1:36:45] Jesus the precious Son of God the ones
[1:36:49] thou called Jesus standing up there one
[1:36:51] day on Calvary he said when he seen the
[1:36:54] thickest part of any human life the
[1:36:56] darkest part death
[1:36:58] every man fears death he said and when
[1:37:01] Jesus of Nazareth run against every
[1:37:03] devil in hell
[1:37:07] when Jesus run against every devil that
[1:37:10] there was in hell he didn't some devils
[1:37:13] you fight he didn't say this devil or
[1:37:15] that devil uh maybe this devil or or
[1:37:17] maybe this sickness he said when he run
[1:37:20] against every devil that was in hell and
[1:37:23] caught death caught him and pulled him
[1:37:26] right into his bosom he said he called
[1:37:29] him and put him right into his bosom and
[1:37:31] conquered death
[1:37:32] he sent back the Holy Spirit
[1:37:38] listen what he said he sent back the
[1:37:40] Holy Spirit he said take this and do the
[1:37:43] best you can Liberate the people
[1:37:47] the Holy Spirit was commanded to
[1:37:49] liberate the people the Holy Spirit was
[1:37:52] given to set you and I free it was given
[1:37:54] so that we could be just like Jesus we
[1:37:57] could be creators and after

[1:38:14] no such thing he said but I'm going to
[1:38:16] pick it up and say we need to receive
[1:38:19] the Holy Ghost and because it will
[1:38:20] defeat every devil of sin drunkenness
[1:38:23] whatever it is we've got him on the run
[1:38:27] to be
[1:38:28] conquered
[1:38:32] I'm tired of running from Satan
[1:38:36] I like to see him on the run for a
[1:38:38] little while I want enough god in me
[1:38:41] that when the devil looks at me he said
[1:38:42] oh no he's up again I'm getting out of

[1:38:54] Sorrows is conquered he said uh we are
[1:38:58] at the spirit in our own possession as
[1:39:00] Divine the branches on the vine the
[1:39:02] spirit emerging and energizing the
[1:39:04] church with the Holy Spirit we've
[1:39:06] commanded to go into the world and
[1:39:08] preach the gospel
[1:39:10] cast out Devils lay hands on the sick
[1:39:13] and they shall recover
[1:39:16] let me tell you there's there's big
[1:39:18] things happening
[1:39:19] around the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:39:22] it's not just here but you listen to
[1:39:23] messages you watch Service as you go
[1:39:25] participate in Services big things are
[1:39:28] happening around the Bride of Jesus
[1:39:30] Christ
[1:39:31] in Virginia and Florida in Tennessee in
[1:39:34] Kentucky right here in Elkton Kentucky
[1:39:36] big things can happen with the Holy
[1:39:39] Ghost in our lives
[1:39:41] we have to harness the power harness the
[1:39:44] energy of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:50] you see in the beginning I'm going to
[1:39:51] lay some foundations now we're building
[1:39:53] today
[1:39:55] in the beginning you have God and he
[1:39:57] created the Heaven and the Earth and you
[1:40:00] see God began to create out of a thought
[1:40:02] that he had in his mind
[1:40:04] and on what he wanted to accomplish
[1:40:07] begin to build upon his thoughts and the
[1:40:10] Bible tells us the first thing that God
[1:40:12] is the creator in the beginning he
[1:40:14] created the heavens and the Earth
[1:40:19] so here God speaks
[1:40:22] and things begin to come into existence
[1:40:25] things that wasn't there are now
[1:40:28] beginning to appear and God begins to
[1:40:31] act solely this creation is solely upon
[1:40:34] this act of God this is not an accident
[1:40:37] this is not an accident that God said to
[1:40:40] set up and said God said let there be
[1:40:42] that was not an accident there was a
[1:40:44] plan there was a blueprint there was
[1:40:46] something in thought in the very Mind Of
[1:40:48] God that he wanted to create this
[1:40:52] this deity this self-expression of God
[1:40:57] brothers and sisters creating a world is
[1:41:00] work
[1:41:03] you ask any Builder
[1:41:06] work if you build a house it's work
[1:41:10] it's hard work if you're going to build
[1:41:12] a family
[1:41:15] it's work it's hard work if you're going
[1:41:18] to build a career it's work it's hard
[1:41:21] work if you're going to build a life
[1:41:23] that is surrounded and filled with the
[1:41:25] power of God Almighty it's work it's a
[1:41:28] lot of work it's hard work and God
[1:41:30] begins to prove that to us as he begins
[1:41:32] to build and he begins to speak the
[1:41:35] worlds into existence and step by step
[1:41:37] by step we see God using his Almighty
[1:41:41] power
[1:41:43] I want you to notice that there is an
[1:41:44] order to this creation the first there's
[1:41:47] an order to this that God takes the form
[1:41:50] of chaos you might say
[1:41:53] and the prophecy there's a little
[1:41:55] clinker began to drop
[1:41:57] and he takes this form and he begins to
[1:41:59] go into the Realms of the heavens and on
[1:42:02] day one God creates the lock and
[1:42:04] separates it from the darkness and he's
[1:42:06] forming day and night on day two he
[1:42:10] separates the waters and he creates the
[1:42:13] sky
[1:42:14] on the first part of day three he
[1:42:16] separates the dry land from the sea
[1:42:19] now notice that all of these I told you
[1:42:21] these were in an order in a sequence
[1:42:23] for a purpose I want you to notice that
[1:42:26] all of these were essential to the
[1:42:28] survival of what was to follow
[1:42:32] have you noticed in the Bible
[1:42:34] as time goes on you learned a little
[1:42:37] something from the people behind you
[1:42:39] you learned a little lesson from Moses
[1:42:41] you learned a little lesson from David
[1:42:43] all of those things were essential to
[1:42:45] get the Bride of Jesus Christ where she
[1:42:47] needs to be at the end time
[1:42:51] so God he begins to meticulously plan
[1:42:54] all of this out
[1:42:56] sky has to be a place for the birds the
[1:43:00] ocean has to be in place for the fish
[1:43:02] and the Earth has to be in place
[1:43:04] for you
[1:43:06] and God meticulously puts all of this in
[1:43:09] order here and he begins to fill these
[1:43:11] Realms that he has created
[1:43:13] on day three he creates plant life
[1:43:16] on day four the Sun the moon the stars
[1:43:19] the sky the lights are beautiful in
[1:43:21] themselves can you imagine the picture
[1:43:22] as God has been
[1:43:24] building off of this blueprint that he
[1:43:27] had in his mind
[1:43:29] and he's building step by step by step
[1:43:31] and on day five God fills the water in
[1:43:34] the sky with fishes and birds
[1:43:36] gonna survived without the plants that
[1:43:38] he put in a few days before
[1:43:40] nothing is out of order with God
[1:43:43] nothing is out of out of order with God
[1:43:46] nothing's out of place everything's in
[1:43:48] sequence
[1:43:49] in other words you can't lose
[1:43:53] finally on the sixth day he creates
[1:43:56] animals and then the Apex of God's
[1:43:59] creation
[1:44:00] the humanity to populate the land
[1:44:05] God and objects of worship setting up
[1:44:07] there with a desire for somebody to love
[1:44:10] him
[1:44:10] with a desire for somebody to worship
[1:44:13] him with a desire for somebody to adore
[1:44:16] him and praise him and
[1:44:18] lift him up you know a lot of times we
[1:44:21] get it backwards we we hope God will do
[1:44:23] all that for us
[1:44:25] we want to feel God's love we want to
[1:44:27] feel God's affection we want to feel
[1:44:28] God's blessings but the truth of the
[1:44:30] matter is it started with him wanting to
[1:44:32] be wanted by us
[1:44:34] he cares that much for you and I that he
[1:44:37] wants to be worshiped by us
[1:44:42] pay close attention here by noticing
[1:44:45] God accomplishes all of these things
[1:44:49] by speaking
[1:44:52] God's there
[1:44:53] God said
[1:44:55] God said
[1:44:56] God said
[1:44:58] God said let there be
[1:45:00] and it was
[1:45:02] and if we're many creators
[1:45:05] if we're supposed to be set in an
[1:45:07] atmosphere that God can be right in our
[1:45:10] midst and if we're sending an atmosphere
[1:45:12] if God said why can't bride say
[1:45:16] because the word says with the Greater
[1:45:18] Works is what we will do
[1:45:23] brothers and sisters this lets us know
[1:45:25] that God's power is more than sufficient
[1:45:28] to create and maintain his creation
[1:45:32] you think his plan is going to falter
[1:45:35] no do you think his plan is going to
[1:45:37] fall short
[1:45:38] no there is common a rapture
[1:45:41] somebody's going to see it
[1:45:43] might as well be me
[1:45:46] somebody's going to see it somebody's
[1:45:48] gonna live it somebody is going to
[1:45:49] translate right out of here bam and
[1:45:51] you're going to be in another dimension
[1:45:52] and then
[1:45:55] there's no more time
[1:45:57] you go from time into it
[1:46:03] we don't need to worry about God running
[1:46:05] out of gas
[1:46:08] you know we we we we kind of wonder
[1:46:10] sometimes as is this Creation in a dire
[1:46:13] state of existence so you know the world
[1:46:16] around us is looks like it's just
[1:46:18] completely Fallen apart
[1:46:20] and from time to time we look at it and
[1:46:22] we think oh my goodness
[1:46:26] what is going on
[1:46:31] spiritually speaking it may look so
[1:46:35] but nothing is out of order
[1:46:39] the chaos that you see in this world
[1:46:41] today is exactly what's got to happen
[1:46:45] things that are going on in this world
[1:46:47] the people turning from God losing their
[1:46:49] love for God and their desire for for
[1:46:52] God and church and Christianity it's got
[1:46:55] to happen
[1:46:57] but God's creation
[1:46:59] God's creation the true creation his
[1:47:02] passion what he loves and what he's
[1:47:04] passionate about the true love the Bride
[1:47:07] of Jesus Christ she's vibrant she's only
[1:47:11] she's in love She's On Fire for God
[1:47:13] she's moving on right where she should
[1:47:16] be she is making herself ready
[1:47:22] go
[1:47:23] God this creation is secure
[1:47:27] the believer's existence is secure
[1:47:30] Satan can't harm you
[1:47:33] he has to ask permission to touch you
[1:47:36] he can't lay a finger on you
[1:47:39] we're just like job you got a hedge
[1:47:41] about you and I pray that on my my kids
[1:47:45] all the time when they go out I say God
[1:47:47] put more hedge of protection around my
[1:47:49] children
[1:47:51] with that hedge of protection
[1:47:58] you know God doesn't
[1:48:00] need help from anyone
[1:48:02] or anything really to maintain his goals
[1:48:06] huh
[1:48:08] and I'll prove it to you at the end here
[1:48:10] God's going to have it God's way
[1:48:13] and there's nothing that can change that
[1:48:16] so you do you realize no matter how Grim
[1:48:18] it may look through our Earthly eyes as
[1:48:20] we look out there there is no battle
[1:48:24] there are no forces there is no amount
[1:48:27] of Chaos
[1:48:29] that can threaten or undo the creation
[1:48:32] that God has begun in his bride
[1:48:38] I feel so defeated
[1:48:41] you win
[1:48:45] we don't go on feelings
[1:48:48] that's why we don't go on feelings
[1:48:49] because I wake up a lot of mornings and
[1:48:51] think man I don't feel like getting out
[1:48:52] of bed I don't feel like going I don't
[1:48:54] feel like reading I don't feel like
[1:48:55] praying I don't feel like talking
[1:48:59] we can't base what we're going through
[1:49:01] on our feelings you say well well I I
[1:49:04] feel beat down you win
[1:49:07] you're looking at it through the wrong
[1:49:08] set of eyes
[1:49:10] you have to put your spiritual eyes on
[1:49:12] when you don't feel good
[1:49:14] you have to look through your spiritual
[1:49:16] eyes and keep preaching and keep pushing
[1:49:18] and keep pushing and keep building God's
[1:49:20] Kingdom in your very life
[1:49:25] somewhere between Genesis 1 and
[1:49:28] Revelations 21
[1:49:30] this Earth was corrupted
[1:49:33] this Earth was seems broken this world
[1:49:37] seems to be out of kilter it seems to be
[1:49:40] filled with people and forces that are
[1:49:43] completely and continually working
[1:49:45] against against God's very purpose
[1:49:50] and it looks like not everything in this
[1:49:52] world is going according to God's plan
[1:49:55] and that's why the prophet said she can
[1:49:58] do the Greater Works we've used this
[1:50:00] quote a lot lately it must mean
[1:50:02] something
[1:50:03] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[1:50:06] an invincible Army if you get the two
[1:50:08] the revelation of the two Spirits within
[1:50:10] the framework of the Christian church
[1:50:13] if you get that framework of the two
[1:50:15] Spirits he said in the Christian church
[1:50:17] and by God's spirit discern
[1:50:23] there's your key
[1:50:24] If You by God's spirit can just
[1:50:28] discern
[1:50:31] two Spirits What Spirit are you
[1:50:33] following
[1:50:35] what are you being led by what are you
[1:50:37] answering
[1:50:39] to
[1:50:40] what are you
[1:50:41] commit
[1:50:43] ment to what are you doing to then
[1:50:45] discern the two spirits and then she
[1:50:47] will be able to withstand the Antichrist
[1:50:50] spirit
[1:50:51] and Satan will be powerless before her
[1:51:01] brothers and sisters God chose to share
[1:51:04] his creativity
[1:51:06] he chose to share the creative
[1:51:09] responsibility with human beings
[1:51:11] it's God's choice not a necessity
[1:51:18] it's a privilege may I say it that way
[1:51:21] that God would entrust you
[1:51:23] that God would look down and say
[1:51:27] that person is so important he loves me
[1:51:29] so much
[1:51:30] he has dedicated his life to me so much
[1:51:33] I'm going to freely pour myself out upon
[1:51:35] him
[1:51:36] I'm going to pour myself out upon her
[1:51:39] and the Very works that I do up here
[1:51:41] they'll do
[1:51:43] that's the way God thinks about you so
[1:51:46] think about this now
[1:51:48] God is building a kingdom God wants to
[1:51:51] pour himself out into you
[1:51:53] and we've heard the story about the
[1:51:55] ocean right if I go to the ocean and I
[1:51:58] find and I jump into the ocean and I
[1:51:59] take a big old swallow a gulf of the
[1:52:01] ocean water
[1:52:03] there's about 92 minerals and salts that
[1:52:06] are in that ocean water and if I take a
[1:52:08] big old gulp of that ocean of water I'm
[1:52:11] gonna choke I'm going to gag I'm gonna
[1:52:13] spew because I'm not used to that ocean
[1:52:16] water
[1:52:19] now if I go take a teaspoon out there
[1:52:22] and dip it in that ocean and put it in
[1:52:25] my mouth what am I gonna do I'm gonna
[1:52:27] choke and I'm gonna spew and I'm gonna
[1:52:30] get that out of my system because it's
[1:52:32] the same 92 elements that's in the ocean
[1:52:34] in the vast ocean that it is in the
[1:52:37] teaspoon
[1:52:39] and so everything that God is the ocean
[1:52:42] of God's ability and his power to build
[1:52:45] a kingdom it all Lays right here if God
[1:52:49] is Faith your faith if he's virtue your
[1:52:51] virtue if he's knowledge your knowledge
[1:52:53] your patience your godliness your
[1:52:55] brotherly kindness your love your
[1:52:58] everything that God is because one
[1:53:00] teaspoon of God is enough and sufficient
[1:53:03] for all
[1:53:04] [Applause]
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:08] we have to understand that if God is
[1:53:11] building a kingdom
[1:53:13] so is Satan
[1:53:16] but the difference is is Satan has zero
[1:53:19] ability to create anything
[1:53:24] he can't create nothing
[1:53:26] when we look at Satan we we have to
[1:53:27] understand he's a counterfeit
[1:53:31] he he's not an original he's a bluff
[1:53:35] he's an Illusionist
[1:53:36] he uses trickery he's he's an antagonist
[1:53:39] on God's people he likes to use
[1:53:42] Illusions you've all seen Illusionist
[1:53:44] right they can make things appear like
[1:53:46] they're not right you know you say
[1:53:49] I'm not an Illusionist I did the best I
[1:53:51] could do
[1:53:53] but they appear make things appear as
[1:53:55] though they're not so he's an
[1:53:57] Illusionist and Satan is this
[1:53:58] counterfeiter but the one thing I know
[1:54:00] the most about Satan to be absolutely
[1:54:02] true is that he is a liar
[1:54:09] and Satan is only as powerful as we make
[1:54:13] him
[1:54:14] Satan is only as powerful as we let him
[1:54:17] be
[1:54:19] he's only as big as we let him grow
[1:54:22] he's only as loud as we let him bark
[1:54:26] he has no ability
[1:54:29] and so here it is Satan if we let him
[1:54:31] come into our lives and we let him place
[1:54:34] the shackles of unbelief and sin around
[1:54:37] us
[1:54:39] we've allowed that to come into our home
[1:54:42] we've allowed that to come into this
[1:54:44] Kingdom that we're building
[1:54:48] and if we allow that to come in there
[1:54:50] then we find ourselves under what
[1:54:52] bondage
[1:54:53] we find ourselves under bondage come on
[1:54:56] church if we allow fear to enter into
[1:54:58] the channel of our thoughts
[1:55:02] what do we become we become anxious
[1:55:05] we become nervous we become scared that
[1:55:08] our whole world is falling apart why is
[1:55:11] that why are preachers preaching so hard
[1:55:13] on anxiety fear and nervousness
[1:55:16] I'll tell you why they're preaching on
[1:55:18] it because it's the age we're living in
[1:55:20] and the prophet said in the end times
[1:55:22] it's an age of neurotics
[1:55:26] and so we're battling those same Spirits
[1:55:28] you're not you're not uh you're not
[1:55:30] immune to the spirits that you're
[1:55:31] rubbing up against
[1:55:33] our job though is to battle them so
[1:55:35] preachers are having to hit on fear
[1:55:36] anxiety nervousness over and over and
[1:55:39] over and if we let those come into our
[1:55:41] thoughts and we let a doubt it flare up
[1:55:44] in our Christians life it won't belong
[1:55:46] to you even wonder if you're saved
[1:55:49] you will actually Wonder you'll begin to
[1:55:52] question
[1:55:53] and there's nothing but a lie of the
[1:55:56] devil it's an illusion that he tells you
[1:55:59] you're not going to make it you're not
[1:56:01] living good enough let me tell you none
[1:56:03] of us are living good enough
[1:56:05] none of us are living good enough we
[1:56:08] need to live closer to God today than
[1:56:10] we've ever lived in our lives
[1:56:13] I liked what brother Butler said he
[1:56:14] needs to get more into the word I need
[1:56:17] to get more into the word
[1:56:19] you need to get more into the word
[1:56:22] we need to stay in God's presence
[1:56:32] he knows
[1:56:36] Satan knows just what channels to get
[1:56:39] into to infiltrate your minds
[1:56:42] he knows just which Avenues to go down
[1:56:45] to he knows your every weakness
[1:56:47] he knows the weaknesses that your flesh
[1:56:50] has he knows the weaknesses that's been
[1:56:52] handed down to you from generation to
[1:56:55] generation Maybe by your great great
[1:56:57] grandfather there is a flaw in your DNA
[1:57:00] system
[1:57:01] because you're human
[1:57:03] and Satan begins to explore that and he
[1:57:06] looks back and he says you know
[1:57:08] foreign
[1:57:13] had this problem
[1:57:17] I think I can probably get him with that
[1:57:20] problem
[1:57:22] you think he don't know who you are
[1:57:25] he knows exactly who you are he knows
[1:57:28] whether he knows whether the uh whether
[1:57:30] he knows everything about your family we
[1:57:33] might as well say that Satan knows your
[1:57:35] family tree
[1:57:36] he knows your history
[1:57:39] but thinking about that thank God I know
[1:57:42] that my my life was bought and paid for
[1:57:44] on a tree on Calvary my family tree of
[1:57:48] my history does not matter because my
[1:57:50] tree is on calvary's Hill
[1:57:53] yeah
[1:57:54] that's where I get my freedom
[1:58:03] Martin
[1:58:05] are gone my soul's been set free
[1:58:09] and brothers and sisters
[1:58:12] the question today is which kingdom are
[1:58:13] we building this morning
[1:58:16] which kingdom are we building this
[1:58:17] morning you know the the Bible tells us
[1:58:20] that the Israelites were slaves in Egypt
[1:58:25] they had to make bricks for Pharaoh's
[1:58:28] buildings
[1:58:30] that's what they did
[1:58:32] they come down there and and there's a
[1:58:35] new King in town
[1:58:36] and this King he really didn't care and
[1:58:39] and Joseph meant nothing to him
[1:58:43] all the goodness that the people of God
[1:58:45] had
[1:58:46] all the freedoms they had it meant
[1:58:49] nothing to this new king
[1:58:50] and he comes there and he says you know
[1:58:52] what we have to be careful here guys
[1:58:55] he said they're growing in numbers
[1:58:58] and they're getting bigger and bigger
[1:59:00] and bigger and the more they grow and
[1:59:03] the more they stay in the word and the
[1:59:05] more they pray
[1:59:09] the stronger they get and they could
[1:59:11] just get enough people together to
[1:59:13] uprise against us
[1:59:16] and then they're going to overthrow us
[1:59:18] and we can't win the war and soon we'll
[1:59:21] be they'll be too large for us to defeat
[1:59:23] and to have bondage over them
[1:59:27] basically what he was saying was if this
[1:59:30] person brings his liquor fire
[1:59:32] and this one brings his look of fire and
[1:59:35] she brings her Lake of Fire and this
[1:59:37] lick of fire in this liquor fire and
[1:59:39] then all this leaks of fire began to
[1:59:40] come together we become an Unstoppable
[1:59:43] Army before pharaoh and Pharaoh knew
[1:59:47] that so he tried to hinder them by
[1:59:49] putting oppression on them and forced
[1:59:52] labor upon the children of Israel
[1:59:54] God's people under forced labor now pray
[1:59:59] question
[2:00:02] building the ancient Egyptian
[2:00:05] monuments
[2:00:07] but Satan has you do for him
[2:00:12] if you're not careful
[2:00:15] the great monuments were built with
[2:00:17] stones to the last eons of times we see
[2:00:20] it in the pyramids the Sphinx all the
[2:00:23] tombs King touch tomb all those filled
[2:00:25] with stones
[2:00:26] but you know what
[2:00:28] palaces
[2:00:30] the very home
[2:00:33] Satan the kingdom of pharaoh has built
[2:00:36] with mud bricks so that it would become
[2:00:38] uncomfortable so that it would be cool
[2:00:40] In the Heat of the day and warm at night
[2:00:45] and it was built on the backs of God's
[2:00:48] people
[2:00:51] there's a painting in rockemeyer's Tomb
[2:00:54] rockemeyer was an
[2:00:55] ancient Egyptian
[2:00:58] a noble official of the 18th Dynasty he
[2:01:01] was a governor of
[2:01:03] slave
[2:01:05] making bricks
[2:01:07] and it shows it's like a it's like a
[2:01:09] do-it-yourself step by step step one two
[2:01:11] three four and he tells every step of
[2:01:13] how it's done in these hieroglyphics
[2:01:15] the paintings in his town
[2:01:18] but the first app and what I would
[2:01:20] consider probably the hardest step
[2:01:22] was there was a pit that was dug in some
[2:01:24] of the best clay around
[2:01:26] they would put water in there and it
[2:01:28] shows in these hieroglyphics the slaves
[2:01:31] trodden
[2:01:32] and packing the mud and the clay and in
[2:01:35] this bog in their tracking and they're
[2:01:37] treading and they're bogged down and sin
[2:01:40] they're bogged down with with oppression
[2:01:43] they're balled down with doubts and
[2:01:45] fears
[2:01:46] are you with me
[2:01:47] and they're carrying the weight and the
[2:01:50] burdens that Pharaoh has put upon them
[2:01:51] so that he can be glorified
[2:01:55] this is God's people
[2:01:58] and they're going through there and
[2:01:59] they're looking at there and they're
[2:02:00] bogged down by old habits
[2:02:04] and they're bogged down by new habits
[2:02:08] you say new habits I thought we're
[2:02:09] Christians we shouldn't pick up new
[2:02:11] habits well
[2:02:15] let me tell you
[2:02:16] it happens
[2:02:18] and that's where
[2:02:20] bogged down
[2:02:24] the trip for us to get out of the mud
[2:02:26] pits
[2:02:27] we are far past time to be treading in
[2:02:30] the mud pits of Satan and Pharaoh's mud
[2:02:33] pit we have no need or no ability we
[2:02:37] should have no desire to build it
[2:02:39] any buildings for Satan
[2:02:46] and Moses
[2:02:47] comes onto the scene here
[2:02:50] and Moses comes onto the scene here with
[2:02:52] a word from the Lord
[2:02:54] and he says pharaoh
[2:02:56] let my people go
[2:03:00] Let My People Go Moses had a word from
[2:03:03] the Lord and God says Moses I'm tired of
[2:03:05] my people I've heard their cries I've
[2:03:08] heard their oppression I've heard their
[2:03:10] cries and I want you to go down there
[2:03:12] and tell pharaoh to let my people go
[2:03:15] now let me tell you
[2:03:17] if you're a king of a kingdom and you've
[2:03:19] got thousands and thousands of people
[2:03:21] doing your work in a service to you day
[2:03:24] after day after and you've got them
[2:03:26] right under your thumb are you just
[2:03:27] gonna say okay you can have them by no
[2:03:30] and Pharaoh didn't do that either he
[2:03:32] kept he kept a hold on and he said Moses
[2:03:35] had been true to God come through the
[2:03:37] trials now watch what Moses said all of
[2:03:40] nature screamed out against it as he
[2:03:43] took the Israelites on the path of Duty
[2:03:46] mountains on this side deserts on this
[2:03:49] side he said Pharaoh's Army was pursuing
[2:03:52] them and the Red Sea blocked them off
[2:03:55] all of nature screaming against them
[2:04:01] and he said there they stood it looked
[2:04:03] like God was a poor military man and
[2:04:07] they was trapped
[2:04:10] how many of these ever felt trapped
[2:04:13] you felt like you found yourself in a
[2:04:15] place that you're saying oh my God I
[2:04:17] want out of here so bad but this has
[2:04:19] consumed me so much I can't get out of
[2:04:22] it
[2:04:23] I can't get out of this I can't get rid
[2:04:25] of this fish I can't get rid of this
[2:04:26] doubt I can't get rid of this habit
[2:04:29] and you find yourself right there and it
[2:04:32] looks like you may be a poor military
[2:04:33] man
[2:04:35] because you've got yourself trapped you
[2:04:37] know a deer ain't very smart or a bobcat
[2:04:40] or a skunk or a fox or whatever they're
[2:04:42] not real smart if they find themselves
[2:04:44] trapped
[2:04:45] and these men find themselves trapped
[2:04:48] and he said it looked like God was a
[2:04:49] poor military man to push them right
[2:04:51] into a corner where they would perish
[2:04:57] well that sounds grim
[2:04:59] that sounds gloomy
[2:05:01] that sounds like a a day of doubt and a
[2:05:04] day of Destruction for the children of
[2:05:06] Israel
[2:05:07] but the prophet said that God loves to
[2:05:11] do that
[2:05:13] how many of you love it when he does it
[2:05:17] God loves to do it he said God loves to
[2:05:20] show his mighty hand yes he does he
[2:05:23] likes to show his power
[2:05:27] you see what kind of Kingdom we're
[2:05:28] living in
[2:05:29] we're living in a kingdom of power and
[2:05:32] authority and he said he's waiting to
[2:05:34] show it tonight in you
[2:05:36] he's waiting to show it to the center to
[2:05:38] turn him around to the woman of ill Fame
[2:05:40] to change her back to make her back to a
[2:05:43] young man or a young woman just took a
[2:05:45] wrong path to bring them back he's ready
[2:05:47] to do that he's ready to show his power
[2:05:49] to the man dying of cancer he's ready to
[2:05:52] show his power to diabetes he's ready to
[2:05:54] show his power to the blind
[2:05:58] they're backed into a corner
[2:06:00] he said he's put them right down there
[2:06:02] into that trap it looked like nature
[2:06:04] itself was hiding its face
[2:06:08] and he said one writer said that they
[2:06:10] got into a place and wondered what Moses
[2:06:12] would do and he had one command
[2:06:15] go forward
[2:06:16] go forward he said if you're in the line
[2:06:18] of duty no matter what it says go
[2:06:21] forward go forward he says the greatest
[2:06:24] experiences I've ever had or come up
[2:06:26] against is things I couldn't get over
[2:06:28] things I couldn't go under things I
[2:06:31] couldn't go around things I just had to
[2:06:33] stand there and watch God make a way
[2:06:37] through it
[2:06:39] we don't have to win every battle on our
[2:06:42] own
[2:06:43] God is standing there waiting to show
[2:06:45] himself powerful he wants to do it he
[2:06:48] puts you in places where he can do it
[2:06:50] and you can turn around and say glory to
[2:06:53] God he's seen me through
[2:06:56] he said that old colored man had his
[2:06:59] Bible told you know the story and he
[2:07:00] said they said Moses why you carry that
[2:07:03] Bible you can't read he said I believe
[2:07:05] it
[2:07:07] he said I believe it he said but you
[2:07:09] can't read he said you believe all to
[2:07:11] there I believe it from Kimber to cut
[2:07:13] kiver and The Giver too because it says
[2:07:14] Holy Bible
[2:07:16] and he says almost he said what if God
[2:07:19] you anything God told you to do he said
[2:07:21] yes I would he said what are you going
[2:07:23] to do if God tells you to jump through
[2:07:25] that stone wall
[2:07:27] the guy thought he had him stumped
[2:07:30] he said I'll tell you what I do he said
[2:07:32] I would jump and I would believe there
[2:07:33] would be a hole there if God told me to
[2:07:35] jump
[2:07:37] that's the kind of power that God is God
[2:07:39] Will Make A Way when there seems no way
[2:07:45] you know sometimes getting out of order
[2:07:47] is the best order to be in
[2:07:55] West
[2:07:57] but I liked it when brother Butler come
[2:07:59] down and sang a song on his own this
[2:08:01] morning
[2:08:03] this is the day that the Lord has made
[2:08:05] kind of goes with the scriptures
[2:08:08] did you pick up on that
[2:08:10] God moves in Mighty ways God changes
[2:08:13] things did you hear the song that Sister
[2:08:15] Laura played yeah it was gone movement
[2:08:18] is orchestrating the the whole system we
[2:08:20] build kingdoms
[2:08:22] you want an atmosphere build the
[2:08:25] atmosphere why do you think preachers
[2:08:27] pick certain songs and certain things
[2:08:29] that go with the message they pray about
[2:08:31] it they think on it they're building an
[2:08:33] atmosphere and trying to build an
[2:08:34] atmosphere that you can get yourself
[2:08:36] into and God can have a way to work
[2:08:40] through you
[2:08:44] to pull you to encourage you
[2:08:49] Moses trapped here in this place and
[2:08:51] he's right in the line of duty he says
[2:08:53] it says he's forward
[2:08:55] he said
[2:08:57] Moses he said one writer said that he
[2:08:59] believed God looked down through the
[2:09:01] pillar of fire with angry fiery eyes
[2:09:07] and he looked at that
[2:09:09] red
[2:09:10] sea that was trying
[2:09:12] to cut off his children
[2:09:14] he said in the line of duty they were he
[2:09:17] said in the sea got scared to look
[2:09:20] down through the pillar
[2:09:22] fire with angry fiery eyes
[2:09:25] and in the sea to say sorry
[2:09:29] I didn't mean to
[2:09:31] come on through
[2:09:33] I didn't mean to do that I'm sorry God
[2:09:37] that's how much God cares for you that's
[2:09:38] how much nature responds to the power of
[2:09:41] God and God's Authority he said if he
[2:09:44] can look through that Pillar of Fire and
[2:09:45] do that what could he do for you if
[2:09:48] you'll just look through the blood of
[2:09:49] Jesus Christ
[2:09:54] they crossed over the Red Sea
[2:09:59] see you rolled back they walked across
[2:10:01] on dry land you know they tried to
[2:10:03] debate that and they tried to debate
[2:10:04] that and they try to debate that well
[2:10:06] they can debate that all they want but
[2:10:08] God will put somebody in place that'll
[2:10:10] prove it
[2:10:12] there was some archaeologists and
[2:10:13] scientists they said this is where we
[2:10:16] crossed this is where it's at biblically
[2:10:18] this is where this is where it says it
[2:10:20] would be we're going to do some research
[2:10:22] 30 feet below the water was a highway a
[2:10:27] ridge
[2:10:28] 30 feet below the water and in that they
[2:10:32] found chariots
[2:10:34] and wheels and helmets and skeletons
[2:10:39] dead horses hundreds and hundreds and
[2:10:42] hundreds of Chariots scattered and
[2:10:44] littered across the Red Sea floor tell
[2:10:46] me it didn't happen how did they get
[2:10:48] there
[2:10:50] me
[2:10:54] and the task Masters are now laying all
[2:10:57] behind them dead
[2:11:00] God's people would no longer be beaten
[2:11:02] God's people would no longer be under
[2:11:05] the bondage no more no more treading in
[2:11:08] the pits of Meyer and bogged down by the
[2:11:10] by the things of Satan in their life
[2:11:13] the task my sisters lay Dead behind them
[2:11:17] and Moses's message of let my people go
[2:11:23] had come to pass
[2:11:30] you see we had a message from God in our
[2:11:31] day too
[2:11:35] we had a message from God in our day too
[2:11:37] and
[2:11:39] my people
[2:11:41] come out of her my people come out of
[2:11:44] denominations come out of your
[2:11:45] denominational way of thinking and

[2:11:52] hey brothers and sisters God is building
[2:11:55] the kingdom a holy ghost filled bride
[2:11:58] that will take her stand against the
[2:11:59] kingdom of Satan Joshua 1 it talks about
[2:12:03] after the death of Moses the servant of
[2:12:05] the Lord came to pass that the Lord
[2:12:06] spoken to Joshua the son of none and he
[2:12:09] said Moses my servant is dead
[2:12:16] now follow along with me
[2:12:18] Moses had a message let my people go
[2:12:22] the prophet had a message come out of
[2:12:24] her my people
[2:12:25] the word says to Joshua
[2:12:28] Moses my servant is dead
[2:12:34] are you with me
[2:12:37] Moses my servant is dead
[2:12:39] the same
[2:12:41] and God is now telling Joshua you go
[2:12:45] down here and you go over the Jordan you
[2:12:48] take these
[2:12:49] people unto the land which I give them
[2:12:52] you do it Joshua you do it every place
[2:12:56] that The Souls of your feet try
[2:12:59] it wasn't the messenger anymore Moses is
[2:13:02] gone

[2:13:33] thy life as I was with Moses
[2:13:37] you remember that ocean we talked about
[2:13:42] as I was an ocean to Moses now you take
[2:13:45] a teaspoon of it Joshua because I was an
[2:13:48] ocean to brother random now you take a
[2:13:51] teaspoon of it Brian you find yourself

[2:14:02] observe
[2:14:04] listen to what he says
[2:14:07] be strong that I may observe and do
[2:14:09] according to the law
[2:14:11] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[2:14:16] now we ain't under law
[2:14:18] but we had a lot of really good words
[2:14:24] marriage and divorce children of a bride
[2:14:26] servancy
[2:14:28] godhead
[2:14:30] and he's telling Joshua
[2:14:33] sure you take what Moses said it was a
[2:14:36] sin and turned not to the left or to the
[2:14:39] right that thou mayest Prosper wherever
[2:14:41] you go I'm going to say you take
[2:14:44] whatever he said and you don't turn from
[2:14:46] the left or the right and you do exactly
[2:14:48] what he said and see if you don't
[2:14:49] Prosper everywhere you may go

[2:15:01] you'll get underneath the word
[2:15:03] and the message
[2:15:05] you will
[2:15:07] see
[2:15:12] I I get mad at myself because I do not
[2:15:15] spend the time I'm being honest with you
[2:15:18] I'm mad at myself because I'm cutting
[2:15:21] myself short of everything God wants to
[2:15:24] do for me
[2:15:29] my priorities are not always what I
[2:15:31] always said I think I got God first I
[2:15:33] know I don't
[2:15:38] this is just coming now this is off the
[2:15:41] notes
[2:15:42] but I told my kids I have to preach
[2:15:44] sometimes when at home when I feel like
[2:15:47] the I need to be
[2:15:48] great
[2:15:50] to make
[2:15:52] sure God is first

[2:16:15] this Holy Ghost Kingdom
[2:16:19] Moses thy servant is dead but as I was
[2:16:21] with Moses
[2:16:23] I will I
[2:16:25] failed thee
[2:16:27] I'm gonna have good courage
[2:16:30] this law shall not depart out of thy
[2:16:33] mouth
[2:16:34] meditate on it day and night
[2:16:40] day and night
[2:16:46] I'm embarrassed
[2:16:49] I'm embarrassed when I
[2:16:51] hear people say
[2:16:52] they listen to three messages
[2:16:54] a day
[2:16:58] I'm embarrassed
[2:17:01] I get occupied
[2:17:06] you know Satan when those children of
[2:17:08] Israel were down there in Egypt
[2:17:11] and they were treading through the muck
[2:17:13] and the minor and they were doing this
[2:17:14] and that Pharaoh said they got too much
[2:17:16] time on their hands take away their
[2:17:17] straw
[2:17:21] he does that in our lives
[2:17:24] they got too much time to read let's
[2:17:26] give them another job
[2:17:27] they got too much time to study
[2:17:30] let's give them another sport to play
[2:17:34] let's put them on another
[2:17:37] travel ball team
[2:17:41] hey I'm preaching to myself
[2:17:43] pointing one at you three at me
[2:17:55] the courage if they were ever thou goest
[2:18:00] something for Joshua that it ought to do
[2:18:02] for us
[2:18:05] when we hear that that God is with thee
[2:18:08] wherever thou goest you know what Joshua
[2:18:10] did he jumped up and it said Joshua
[2:18:12] commanded his officers of the people
[2:18:14] saying pass through the host
[2:18:17] foreign
[2:18:22] everybody prepare your victuals
[2:18:26] for Within
[2:18:29] American River
[2:18:31] he stepped into what the word was saying
[2:18:33] in his hour
[2:18:35] prepare yourself because the day is
[2:18:38] coming
[2:18:39] and the prophet said he can see Joshua
[2:18:41] out there and he said he could see him a
[2:18:43] young leader and he said he didn't get
[2:18:46] scared even though Moses was dead he
[2:18:49] didn't get scared he said but our eyes
[2:18:51] and go across this Jordan he said
[2:18:53] something about it Hallelujah he says
[2:18:55] there's a deep calling to the Deep
[2:19:00] that's what was happening in Joshua's
[2:19:02] life
[2:19:03] because that River it was that they said
[2:19:05] it was at the time of the of the the
[2:19:07] melting of the The Ice and the river was
[2:19:10] flowing faster than it ever flowed it
[2:19:13] was roaring faster than they had ever
[2:19:14] seen and he's standing on this side and
[2:19:16] it's wider than it's ever been and he
[2:19:18] says in three days I'm going across
[2:19:20] there and y'all are coming with me
[2:19:26] that's courage
[2:19:29] that's courage
[2:19:31] and he said there was a deep on the
[2:19:33] other side of that River
[2:19:35] there was a deep over there calling
[2:19:37] saying come over
[2:19:41] that's me saying that probably didn't
[2:19:43] say that come
[2:19:49] hauling from the deep when we listen to
[2:19:51] heaven
[2:19:52] there's something there's a deep that's
[2:19:54] calling when you're sitting there and
[2:19:55] you're awaking in the middle of the
[2:19:56] night and it's laying something
[2:19:58] spiritual in your mind that is a d
[2:20:00] calling down saying come up
[2:20:02] come up it's preparing you to come up a
[2:20:05] little bit higher
[2:20:07] come over
[2:20:10] he said God shows there's something
[2:20:14] pushing down
[2:20:16] coming down to us he said when you hear
[2:20:19] that thing brother you believe this
[2:20:21] tonight believe it in the name of the
[2:20:22] Lord that the things we have done are
[2:20:23] the minor things
[2:20:25] to what God is fixing to do right now
[2:20:30] Prophet said the things that I have done
[2:20:33] are minor things
[2:20:36] compared to what you're fixing to see
[2:20:38] God do now
[2:20:41] you're going to hear of great things
[2:20:45] brothers and sisters
[2:20:50] when I listen to messages being preached
[2:20:52] and brother Byler had mentioned this too
[2:20:54] we hear a move we hear a call we hear a
[2:20:57] a movement of God amongst his people
[2:21:01] and it's preparing a group of people
[2:21:03] and it's getting a group of people ready
[2:21:05] and you're going to hear great things
[2:21:09] and every people's got different gifts
[2:21:11] in their lives and different Ministries
[2:21:12] and and different things happen
[2:21:14] different different singing abilities
[2:21:16] preaching abilities and this preacher
[2:21:18] preaches different than this preacher
[2:21:19] something's got a gift of healing some
[2:21:21] got a gift of teaching some got a gift
[2:21:22] of explaining
[2:21:26] but everybody's moving in One Direction
[2:21:30] get your people ready
[2:21:40] what we need are some joshuas to rise up
[2:21:43] what we need in this hour are some
[2:21:45] joshuas to rise up and stand faithful to
[2:21:48] the words
[2:21:49] been given
[2:21:50] we need men and women who will look art
[2:21:53] out of your mouth
[2:21:57] men and women who will March right
[2:21:59] across the river
[2:22:01] stand the the river that stands in the
[2:22:04] way of your Promised Land
[2:22:06] God is building a kingdom and I'm coming
[2:22:09] to a close bear with me
[2:22:12] Joshua 24 14-16 says now therefore fear
[2:22:16] the lord and serve him in sincerity and
[2:22:19] in truth
[2:22:20] put away the gods which your fathers
[2:22:22] have served on the other side of the
[2:22:24] flood
[2:22:25] and on the other in Egypt as you serve
[2:22:27] the Lord
[2:22:28] and if it seems evil unto you to serve
[2:22:31] the Lord choose this day whom you will
[2:22:34] serve
[2:22:37] whether the Gods
[2:22:39] which your father served were on the
[2:22:40] other side of the flood are the gods of
[2:22:42] the amorites and who
[2:22:45] me and my house
[2:22:49] we're going to serve the Lord Richard
[2:22:52] and said God forbid that we should
[2:22:53] forsake the Lord and serve other gods
[2:22:55] what was he doing he's building a
[2:22:57] kingdom Joshua was building a kingdom
[2:22:59] and telling the people serve God after
[2:23:01] me and my house we're going to serve God
[2:23:06] Jesus answers talks to Simon barjona
[2:23:10] for Flesh and Blood have not revealed
[2:23:12] this unto thee but the Father which is
[2:23:14] in heaven I say unto thee thou Peter
[2:23:16] Upon This Rock my church and the Gates
[2:23:18] of Hell shall not Prevail against it
[2:23:21] and I will give unto thee the king these
[2:23:23] are the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[2:23:25] that shall bind on Earth shall be bound
[2:23:27] in heaven and whatsoever thou shall
[2:23:29] loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven
[2:23:36] he says this is the revelation of Jesus
[2:23:38] Christ in this hour
[2:23:40] not what he was in another hour what he
[2:23:42] is now the Bible expresses it's a grown
[2:23:46] in the bride it's growing the bride to a
[2:23:51] full stature he said the bride the
[2:23:53] Rapture will come forth
[2:23:55] he said and there is any any pre-planed
[2:23:57] by God it's all backed up
[2:23:59] remember I told you God is going to get
[2:24:01] what God wants
[2:24:03] none of us are going to do anything
[2:24:05] outside of what God wants us to do
[2:24:07] listen to this quote the bride is in the
[2:24:10] right and the Rapture will come forth
[2:24:11] there is an all pre-planned by God all
[2:24:14] backed up from the beginning he knows
[2:24:17] every man every place who would sit all
[2:24:19] about it
[2:24:21] he know the exact seat you'd be setting
[2:24:24] in this morning
[2:24:27] June the 30th July 30th 2023.
[2:24:33] he knew when you'd get
[2:24:35] that
[2:24:36] go to the bathroom
[2:24:38] he knew what songs we were going to sing
[2:24:41] he knew it and who wouldn't
[2:24:43] see
[2:24:44] Steve
[2:24:49] he said it's all pre-blind God knew it
[2:24:52] would be here he made it that way so
[2:24:54] that when we get there he's gone to
[2:24:56] prepare a place for us he said when we
[2:24:58] get there it'll all be prepared just
[2:25:00] like even the night is prepared and this
[2:25:02] hour's prepared
[2:25:06] building a kingdom
[2:25:08] God's Building A kingdom
[2:25:11] I'm searching for a city whose Builder
[2:25:13] and maker is God
[2:25:16] he's on the omnipresent because he's
[2:25:17] omniscient he's omniscient because he's
[2:25:19] omnipresent therefore by his
[2:25:21] foreknowledge he can't just be like the
[2:25:24] wind over here and he's a bean
[2:25:27] he just isn't a myth he's a being he
[2:25:29] dwells
[2:25:30] he dwells in a house he dwells in a
[2:25:33] place called heaven and therefore being
[2:25:36] omnipresent omniscient knowing all
[2:25:38] things and omnipresent he knows all
[2:25:41] things he said now
[2:25:43] you grew from your birth when you was
[2:25:46] born and presented into this world God
[2:25:48] knew you were going to be here on this
[2:25:50] Earth
[2:25:51] he he growed from birth to
[2:25:55] Church
[2:26:00] hey I could things would come in my mind
[2:26:02] and I could see it as Vivid as day as
[2:26:04] I'm looking at you and then two three
[2:26:06] days later he'll come to pass
[2:26:09] now what happened with that
[2:26:14] I got old brother Matt
[2:26:18] but he says there's things that happen
[2:26:20] strange
[2:26:24] what was it that led me to go to the
[2:26:27] altar at a Louisiana campus
[2:26:29] full of hundreds of people
[2:26:33] what was it that what was that strange
[2:26:35] feeling that told me to be down there
[2:26:38] you would have thought I'd have been the
[2:26:40] last one there with the group I was with
[2:26:42] I was with a bunch of saints not really
[2:26:47] laughs
[2:26:48] I think we all made it down there before
[2:26:50] the night was over
[2:26:51] but something called on me something
[2:26:53] strange happened and called me to come
[2:26:55] down the front why was that because God
[2:26:57] knew he had a plan for me
[2:26:59] God knows he's got a plan for you
[2:27:01] sometimes he says we just don't
[2:27:03] understand understand these things but
[2:27:05] God is building a kingdom
[2:27:07] God is building a kingdom and his people
[2:27:10] in his bride and the bride is going to
[2:27:13] be in that Kingdom
[2:27:18] listen this and we're going to get ready
[2:27:20] to close
[2:27:21] he said the world had sin the penalty of
[2:27:25] sin was death he had to die that's why
[2:27:27] God was manifested in flesh so he could
[2:27:29] take death on him and pay the penalty
[2:27:31] there's nothing to come back it's not
[2:27:33] earmarked it's absolutely freely paid
[2:27:35] all the debt is paid it belongs to him
[2:27:38] and we are delegates of his kingdom
[2:27:45] so when Satan tells you you're not one
[2:27:46] of his
[2:27:48] that you'll only serve Satan that your
[2:27:51] life is wicked that you can't make it
[2:27:53] that you you'll never make a rapture
[2:27:57] you tell him say Satan you're a liar
[2:28:01] because God tells me that I'm a delegate
[2:28:04] of his kingdom and that I'm assembled
[2:28:06] right here tonight in the name of Jesus
[2:28:08] Christ sitting in Heavenly places
[2:28:12] God is building a kingdom
[2:28:15] let's stand to our feet musicians would
[2:28:18] come
[2:28:42] oh
[2:28:44] let's just bow our heads go before the
[2:28:47] Lord in prayer
[2:28:52] brother Josh if you prepare favorite
[2:28:54] songs and he sings it and and uh
[2:28:59] so if I asked him we get done praying
[2:29:01] he'll sing for us
[2:29:04] it's just bow our heads Heavenly Father
[2:29:05] we're just thankful Lord for this day
[2:29:08] we're thankful Lord to be part of a
[2:29:10] kingdom being built
[2:29:12] that we don't have to
[2:29:16] tread and trot and and be weighed down
[2:29:18] and bogged down into the pits of the
[2:29:21] clay that pharaoh and Satan would Place
[2:29:23] upon us with doubts and fear and
[2:29:26] anxieties and depressions and habits and
[2:29:30] battles that we have to face we don't
[2:29:32] have to be tied down and Shackled In
[2:29:34] bonds anymore
[2:29:35] but we're part of the kingdom of a
[2:29:37] greater Kingdom we're part of an eternal
[2:29:40] Kingdom we're part of a kingdom where
[2:29:42] you you call us Lord Jesus and there's a
[2:29:45] deep that's calling out to the deep and
[2:29:47] there's a place that you've gone to
[2:29:48] prepare for us and it'll be a place as
[2:29:51] we've never imagined before we read
[2:29:53] about it we sing songs about it we
[2:29:57] dream about it but it'll be a place
[2:29:59] where there'll be no more Sorrows No
[2:30:01] More Tears no more fears no more doubts
[2:30:03] no more worries
[2:30:06] it'll just be a Heavenly place
[2:30:08] a Heavenly Home a kingdom
[2:30:12] and Lord Jesus we come to realize that
[2:30:14] no matter what we go through in life
[2:30:17] no matter what challenges we face in
[2:30:19] life
[2:30:20] the obstacles the struggles
[2:30:23] Satan cannot do anything to us that is
[2:30:26] not allowed
[2:30:27] and then no matter what we go through in
[2:30:29] life no matter the the the the the worst
[2:30:32] of struggles the rivers that we've got
[2:30:34] to cross the Roaring rivers that we have
[2:30:36] to cross Lord we realize
[2:30:41] that because of you because of the Holy
[2:30:43] Spirit the holy ghost that was poured
[2:30:45] out on the day of Pentecost

[2:30:49] inside of us
[2:30:51] gives us overcoming power Lord
[2:30:54] we just pray today Lord that if there's
[2:30:57] anybody here that don't know you they
[2:30:58] would come and come and to realize that
[2:31:01] that you are the only way the truth and
[2:31:03] the life Lord
[2:31:04] and Lord we just pray that if there's
[2:31:06] somebody here that don't have the Holy
[2:31:08] Ghost we just pray that you would fill
[2:31:09] them with the Holy Ghost this morning if
[2:31:11] there's somebody here is struggling with
[2:31:13] with any kind of habits or fears in
[2:31:16] their life or or problems Lord we just
[2:31:18] ask that you would just touch their
[2:31:19] hearts in a special way that you would
[2:31:21] draw to them Lord that you would call
[2:31:23] them out let that deep call out to that
[2:31:25] deep
[2:31:27] Lord we just want to be ready
[2:31:29] we want to be ready in this hour we want
[2:31:31] to think about our our Heavenly home as

[2:31:37] we thank you for what you've done for us
[2:31:39] on Calvary we thank you Lord for that
[2:31:42] blood that was shed
[2:31:43] and
