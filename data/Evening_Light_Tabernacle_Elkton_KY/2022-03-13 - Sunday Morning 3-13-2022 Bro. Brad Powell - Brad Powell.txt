all right so let's plan on lord willing doing that amen been a long time since we've even had a hardly a fellowship in or anything and i think that by god's grace it looks like the covet is about pretty much gone don't everybody shout at once now that's awesome isn't it just to know that we ain't hearing a bunch of that mess anymore i'm certainly glad i i almost act silly when i go to a public place i want to say nobody wearing masks that's so nice nice you know but i don't want to act as full but i don't know what to do but i'm glad not to see all that stuff i'm glad to be about pastor that you know you know there for a while we didn't know whether it was going to last forever or what's going to go on you know amen but it was i mean it was something real and this last surge i think was about as bad as the first surge you know and so but anyway we're just thankful to be over it some of us gotta know what it's all about in that right and so it ain't no fun but praise the lord for feeling good everybody feeling good all right go like that a little bit it's cold and stiff i just want you to loosen up get ready for a good service in the lord amen what was it brother ma'am said wave your handkerchief or something you know or hey man just loosen this up a little bit put a smile on that face and expect to hear from the lord this morning so if everybody would respond to us over on the internet about that and then we'll go from there so because we want to try to make it to where it works for everybody amen and then also brother joshua rivas is going to help us out on songs from here on out so if he comes up here and do some song reading so they said you're not wow what's going on here so just letting everybody know amen that he's going to be helping us out amen so praise the lord um but anyway um that's all i can think of so let's just open up service and prayer if you will stand with me amen and amen let's just bow our heads kind heavenly father we come before you lord jesus so grateful lord jesus to feel good this morning to have good health lord jesus and to have good spiritual health lord jesus we should be that's most spiritual healthiest people that ever lived on earth father for we've had such a vindication and such a evidence and such a uh proof lord jesus that you're alive that you're real that the god that created the heavens and the earth is not dead but he's alive he's alive and well living in me and then living in all of us father we ask god this morning that you just come lord and be a present god not a god of history but lord that you would speak to our hearts this morning lord along the way two thousand years ago you walked with your disciples and you spoke with them and exhorted them and so forth and so forth lord jesus but father we need you to walk with us this morning lord jesus we just invite you to come in a special way and we know that you always come where you're invited lord so we're expecting to see you lord jesus to manifest yourself and in all kinds of different ways lord we just don't know what you'll do but we want you to have the preeminence in the service lord whatever it is that you want to do lord and you know each and every one of our needs you know where we're at father you know exactly what we need lord and we ask god that you'd meet those needs lord jesus and speak to our hearts fathers we have assembled ourselves together in a precious name of the lord jesus christ and father we just ask god that you'll bless this service now and also sean that's i'm feeling well this morning woke up with a migraine lord we know that he's had problems with that father we just pray lord that the holy spirit would go where he is just as now just now and touch him in a special way lord and heal him father we ask god that you bless now we worship you father and praise you in jesus christ's name amen and amen sunday school sundays you can be dismissed for sunday school brother tommy are you going to do your bible reading for us this morning get the bear with me they just asked me to do this he asked me to do two or three chapters so i hope you can bear with me uh before i get started though since i'm up here anyway i wanted to share a little testimony i told brother tom i wanted to and you know god just keeps inspiring our faith but one day i got a letter in the mail and i had already been telling tammy that so i just want to believe that you know god he can he can take care of these doctor bills you know and one day i got a letter in the mail i got the letter and opened it and said this is a letter being sent to notify you that your request for financial assistance has been approved and that's all i read i put it up i took a picture of it and sent it to her and she was like does that mean and this is for the icu bills you know i had multiple doc i went to three different hospitals and then i had a life flight homeless bills but this just mainly the icu bills and i kept wondering what they was going to be like when they came in and uh i didn't think much more of it and i was working and stuff and she was like does that mean they're forgiving i'm like i don't know i mean he just says we're approved and this is another miracle about the whole situation because i haven't even had got my taxes back yet so i haven't even applied for any help and uh then the next morning i'm sitting there getting coffee and the letter was laying right there and i'm sitting there getting my coffee and it says it has i read the rest of the letter i didn't even read all the letter that day and it says we have applied the charity as a write-off to this account and it is now closed and that's [Music] [Applause] god is still raising our faith up and get us ready to get out of here but hebrews 11 1 through 10. now faith is the substance of the things hoped for the evidence of things not seen through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so the things we which are seen are not made of the things which do appear by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had the testimony that he pleased god by faith noah being warned of god the things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to save to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness with which is by faith by faith he sojourned in the land of promise and as in a strange country dwelling in the tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with them him of the same promise for we look for a city which have foundation whose builder and maker is god you know after reading something like that what do you have to worry about i mean i know don't get me wrong this world we live in wants to work make you worry about things but what do you really have to worry about if god is in you then you're he's going to take care of it doesn't mean you won't have pain doesn't mean you won't have suffering just means that he's there with you through it um kyla wrote something down last week before i started but you know i was thinking in the world that we're living if you want to turn with me to second timothy the third chapter but i wrote this down one of the scriptures we read last week when jesus was teaching the disciples and and and all the children of israel at that time he gave a prophecy on what would happen to jerusalem and then when you when he told his disciples when you see the enemies surround it uh flee and don't even look back because of what's going to happen and you know and i was thinking those disciples and those people in that day they knew to leave the city when the romans were starting to encircle the city that day so they had a knowledge so they wouldn't be there on that day when that suffering happened and sometimes god is warning us not to be in certain places so we don't go through the judgments that other people go to but do we always listen i'm thinking and i was also thinking this morning uh i was jumping over here this has nothing to do i was just sitting there this morning and as everyone sees what's going on in the world this morning or the last couple of months but i was thinking there's never been a time like this and we we see what's going on in in ukraine and was but what i was thinking about is everyone thought that the mark of the beast or the you know where they could actually keep you from buying and selling it you know we've heard that for hundreds of years for the last 30 or 40 years but you can see it being applied to a whole nation right now to that russian nation right now where they're making it almost impossible for them to buy or sell because they have a they don't agree with what they're doing i'm not taking the side here but and then you can see it on our own country and you can see an encounter if you if you're one of those canadian truck drivers they've actually destroyed your livelihood they've put them in jail they've taken their rights away and does anyone do you hear anything about it they completely took a class of people and took all their rights away where you know you don't hear much about it and even in our own country i'm i'm not like i said i'm not taking side left or right but those people that were there on january 6 they're still people sitting in jail this morning that have been in jail for over a year for some minor offenses now they don't think they were minor but they're still sitting in jail over a year without trial so what i'm trying to say who would ever thought that we'd live in a in a time where things like this could happen they could just in a second take away your bank accounts take away everything that you've worked your whole life for and you just seeing their ability they if they can do it to a whole nation just imagine what they could do to our country or any other country if they took it decided that they were gonna make an example of you and i was also thinking you know we believe things that to the people even our own country we believe things that are that they can't accept if you believe that homosexuality is wrong there's places that you would have a hard time getting a job if you believe that homosexuality is wrong certain behavior is wrong you'd have a heart you'd either have to be totally quiet or you wouldn't you wouldn't do well in certain places that and even in our own country this morning but i was uh just going to read this this uh i was just thinking i'll read this 13th chapter of revelations but what i was also thinking there's been no other time in the time of man where you can see everything that's going on in the world whether everyone has got it here this morning either got a tablet that you're reading the bible offer or you're reading it off your phone that very same instrument allows you to see what's going on so when you read these scriptures and paul in the days of john or paul you know you people for the last thousand years were trying to say how could everyone know what's going on across the total face of the earth well you have that ability this morning that you can see what's happening in ukraine you can see what's happening in china you can see what's happening in south africa you can see the whole world in a little digital device that everyone carries with them nowadays but i'll just read what this says here in this 13th chapter and i stood upon the sands of the sea and i saw our beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon us that's the name of blasphemy and the beast which i saw was like a leopard and his feet were just the feet of a bear in his mouth as the mouth of the lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seed and his great authority and you all know the message i'm not having a separate thought here but what i'm saying is you have an ability now to see this happen all across the world with your digital devices you know in paul's day all they knew the news was in their general area now you know the news all the way around the world and i saw one of his heads as if it was wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast and that's where i'm going the whole world wandered after the beast and the world's the same way with the the ability that we have right now you can wonder after the things that are happening in the world it should give you solace to know if you're in christ then you have something greater for yourself and the world has and as they worship the dragon they gave power on the beast they worshiped the beast saying who was like on to the beast and who was able to make war with him you know and financially that's worse than people shooting at you if they take your financial ability away from you they take your ability for commerce to exchange goods for services they take that away from you what are you you're going to be either going to have to live out in the woods providing for yourself or you won't be able to provide for yourself and it goes on to say and there was given unto him my mouth speaking great things and blasphemed me some power was given on to him to can you continue 40 in two months and he opened his mouth and blessed me against god a blasphemous name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and you see i'm i'm not encouraging it but you can see this on your tablets and on your phones every day where people blaspheme the word of god and blaspheme the things that we hold dear to ourselves and it goes on and it was given on to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and the power was given unto them over all kindreds and tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names were not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world and if any man here let him hear it goes he leadeth into captivity he should go into the p he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword he that is patient and faith of the saints excuse me i didn't read be killed here is the patience and the faith of the saints and behold another beast came out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon but my point being i'm not going to read this whole chapter is i was just thinking of the last couple of months what we see going on in the world whoever thought there would come a time in the world where they could isolate a whole country like they've done over the situation in the last month have almost made it impossible for that country to to thrive as a country well you're one individual is far worse than a country if they can do that to a country imagine what they can do that to an individual or to a group of people so the only hope we have is in christ so i was gonna jump over here to timothy the third chapter this morning i'm not wanting to take a lot of time i know i have some pet peeves i say all the time i don't mean to be a repetitive um i'll just i'll just i want to read i'm not going to read the beginning because it kind of deals with what i read out of revelations but paul starts at about the ninth ninth first year in the second timothy the third chapter but they shall proceed no further for their following shall be manifest onto all all men as theirs also was and he's talking to timothy here and he's saying but that was fully you know my doctrine manner of life purpose faith long-suffering charity and patience paul's basically telling timothy just like brother branham told us and you know to look on to paul as we look on to brother brown as an example and he goes on persecutions afflictions were came on to me and antonaki and forgive my pronunciation like them and listeria what persecutions i endured but of all them all the lord delivered me yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution are we any better that's the thought that comes to my mind we're no better than paul or anyone else but the but evil men and seducers shall act worse and worse deceiving and being deceit but continue down the things which thou has learned and has been [Music] assured knowing of whom thou has learned them and that from a child that was known the holy scriptures and whether you're a 60 year old man that's come to christ or you're a 15 year old boy or girl that's come to christ you can you have to apply these scriptures for that was known the scriptures which were able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in jesus christ all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of god may be perfect and thoroughly furnished onto all good works so this right here in the message of the hour you you have what you need you have what you need to be strengthened every day so you can fight the battle of faith that we deal with and uh you know there there might come a time where you're forced whether to accept their doctrinal i'm not going to call it doctrinal but to hold the job you out there in the world that might come to a point where you might have to confess things that you know that you can't confess or hold that job or to keep your bank account so you've got to be ready for that day i you know i'm i'm not that old i'm early 60s i never thought i'd see a day where the stuff that's going on in our own country i know i'd say this a lot but i can't you can't be surprised anymore you don't know what tomorrow is going to bring but we do have a hope and that hope is in christ itself that if your hope is in that there's nothing that's going on it can be uh it can be not let it dismay you when you look at it you say this is crazy why they keep doing this it keeps getting worse or worse well we don't have any promises for it to get better but we do have a promise to get out of here that's the only promise we have that really counts we don't have promises that it will be better but you can be better this morning by making yourself better staying in the word of god brother david him with all of your heart this morning uh it's good to be a christian isn't it amen amen let's stand and sing that little song this morning i was thinking the brother tommy's testimony this morning and what he said and and i began to think of this song my god is real this morning you believe he's real amen let's sing that if we could well there are some things oh i may not know there are some play says i can't go but i am sure yes love is one thing that god is real or i can feel [Music] my god is real

pay the price whatever others do and i'll take the way with the lords despise you well i started with jesus and i'm going through and oh [Music] [Music] accept it because it is new but not very many expect to go through well i'm going through [Music] with the lord well i've started with jesus and i'm going through and i'd rather walk with jesus alone and have for a pillow like jacob a stone and living each moment with his face and views that shrink from my pathway and failed to go [Music] through and through [Music] oh and i'll pay the price whatever others do and i'll take the way with the lord despise you when i started with jesus and i'm going through and oh brother now will you take up the cross and count on it as draws sell all thou has and give to the poor and go through with jesus

this morning and man god is so awesome and you know look at daniel and brother brian brother jeff would you come pick up the offering this morning i remember brother sean this morning he's under the weather still want to pray for him and the enemy is really fighting by the sean and just want to keep him in our prayers this morning and our shut-ins brother parish sister parish and sister peggy smith the different ones and and then we're just so thankful for god's grace and mercy and you know we we serve an awesome god this morning and you know i was thinking about tommy's testimony and i began to think back in in times whenever we went through hard trials and we wondered how we how things would go and we used to burn propane i hate propane i don't even have it anymore because i just don't like it and at the end of time we'd pray think lord if you don't undertake we're going to be cold and i've seen the lord move in a special way and what brought that to mine was this morning brother andrew glover put a thing on facebook this morning he said if god could turn water into wine he can take care of your gas tank where you need to go so we need to all believe and you know i thought you know what your problem is and i'm talking about me said you've got too much and you don't have enough faith like you need to have because when it's truth when it comes push to shove he's never let us down we've always failed i have i can't speak for you but i have failed many times but our heavenly father has never failed he's always kept his hand upon us he's always led us and guide us in the right way and i was talking with sean the other day and we were texting and and he told me some things on his heart i said i want to tell you i said you make sure it's the will of god i said because i've told this many times i didn't lose i didn't move here years ago like the lord wanted me to i moved here about 16 years ago but a long time before that he laid on my heart to go and i didn't i said you know i said he'd give me a good old-fashioned spanking he beat the far out of me and i said i make sure now that i'm in his perfect will because i don't ever want another spanking like that and i said you just be sure and pray and if it's in god's will he'll take care of the problem and i said don't be like me and get in the way i can only say that by personal experience but just pray that god will keep us all in this perfect will this morning also sister lois has a couple of prayer requests this morning says please pray for our dog he can hardly walk and also a friend of mine went on a campbell her mother has dementia and pray for her so they can get sleep she's going up and down and i know all about dementia with my dad and i'll tell you that's a that's a horrible disease and just remember that family in prayer that god would just be with him if you have any on your heart you might let it be known uplifting hand daniel would pray over the offering this morning amen the eastern gate sister becky amen well i will meet you in the morning oh just inside the eastern gates yes lord then be ready [Music] oh i will meet you i will meet you in the morning just

that what you're looking for this morning amen good to be in the house of the lord that'll be all for the music i tell you i hope your hearts are full of expectation and anticipation this morning and not only for the service today but for the coming of the lord uh brothers and sisters i don't know about you but for me the coming of the lord is more real today than it's ever been in my life and as we look and and see the things that's going on around the world and and i'm going to bring out some of those things today and and look at those things and but we as christians we should be striving and working and pushing and dedicating ourselves and our and our brothers and sisters others around us in a you know in a greater way to the word of god like we've never pushed before you know brother byler i was telling him he recently spoke on being precise and and living with precision and and two or three days in a row i worked woke up in the morning the first thing that hit my mind was man we're so close the message he preached on precision just really stuck with me and you know and you know that's important that we are precise it's important that we're precise because there's many in this world that claim christianity there's many in this world that claim to be pride many put a claim you know the bible tells us there's churches churches and brides brides and and you know but for many it's just claim it's just a claim you say well how do you know that why are you being so critical how do you know that i know that because when you see scripture and you see prophecy begin to be fulfilled around them they can't handle it they can't handle what's really happening around them and you begin to watch and fear and nervousness it begins to set in on them and they begin to tremble at the very word that they claim did you think about that and i was thinking about myself you know and and i think you know they're focusing on the event and not the finality the events shouldn't matter to us it's the main event the finality that we should be looking for because the bride she's looking up the bride of christ is looking up she begins to make herself ready when all these things happen there's no fear it's no trembling it's dressing herself she's getting herself ready and she's beginning to look and she's she's saying i'm anticipating because the groom is on the way in and i'm looking for this grand finale this main event the rapture let me ask you do you fear russia do you fear what's happening do we watch do we know do we concern sure we are but are you scared what are you scared of if you're living in christ what are you scared of turn with me to philippians 2. how many loves the lord this morning philippians 2. i'm going to read out of philippians i i tell you what i this is going to be one of those messages that it's a this is a series it's a first half and a second half part one part two all in one day i told joyce yesterday i tell you we was we was running a few errands and should never do that on the saturday before sunday when you preach and i i told her i said man i wish the lord would tell me what to preach i said yeah i tell you i just don't know what i'm gonna what i'm gonna speak on i didn't until later in the evening yesterday and you know i was trying to we just we needed to take about an hour and a half to run to clarksville and do a few things that had to be done and get over there in sam's and what should have took a 30 minutes was an hour uh you know loaded up all over onto the counter and they said well your membership's expired you got to go to the member's counter so take everything off the go to the membership counter you know just those kinds of things and it's just like your nervousness and stuff wants to set in but if you've got philippians 2 this morning say amen let's look at verse 4. look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus i want to focus a portion of our service on that let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross i want to speak this morning on jesus finding lost things jesus finding lost things let's pray heavenly father we're just thankful to be in your house this morning and have a place that we can come and worship and fellowship with brothers and sisters of light precious faith brothers and sisters that are committed to living a holy life a life that would be pleasing to you and lord a life that we would reflect on ourselves and look and say how can we get closer and and make adjustments and corrections and as our pastor preached recently on being precise in the way we live our life lord we're just it's just an honor and a privilege to be able to fellowship with people like that lord we just want to commit ourselves to you this morning as the word goes forth may it sink down into our hearts to draw as close to you if there's somebody here that that that don't know you're somebody is not as close to you as they once were for somebody that's maybe just drifted lord we just asked or that you would just come down and speak to their heart our hearts because we're we're human lord and and we just seek and and long to be close to you lord there's nothing like knowing that when we call upon your name that you can that you'll wrap your arm around us lord and pull us close to you lord we just want to tell you we love you and appreciate you in jesus name amen amen you can have your seats so looking at the scripture here um just to lay a foundation paul is telling us that if we're going to be like christ and if we're called according to his purpose if we are the elect if we're the bride if we're the chosen few and and brothers and sisters if that's what we're claiming this morning then we're going to have to have that same mind that christ had and and and we're going to have to walk like him we're going to have to talk like him we're going to have to act like him we're going to have to conduct business like him we're going to have to love like him we're gonna have to forgive like him are you with me this morning and as we look at these things you say well we've heard that for years you're right and what we do we take scripture and we take these things knowing we have a goal in mind we have a place that we're trying to get to and knowing how that we've got to do these things so we begin to take scripture and we break down that scripture and we find something in the scripture that we can type to it and something that can lead us along the way because we look back at the saints of old and we say if they could do it we can do it god gave us examples placed back way way way way way back before we were ever born this says there is a way for you to be what you should be so imagine here if you will this man jesus so humble and so obedient to the word so let me tell you you're going to have to have the same kind of humility and obedience if we're going to be like him and as we look at this i imagine if you will jesus coming down from the throne of heaven and becoming a man and we look at this and we see that jesus was set enthroned in heaven's glory and there was nobody there to tell jesus what to do there was no rules for him to to have to obey because somebody said this was jesus's home this was his territory this is god's own domain and jesus leaves heaven's glory to be found himself in the appearance of man and becoming obedient to the death that was set before him that's what our scripture tells us here that he fashioned himself as a man and brothers and sisters he indeed humbled himself and we look at this jesus humbled himself when he took on [Music] the form of man jesus could have come as anything he wanted to think about the cr the creation that he had in a heavenly being in a heavenly place the angels the arab the cherubs the seraphims all up there think about the golden the golden city as you picture jesus and he could have come down as any kind of high authority or dignitary to set such a standard that nobody could ever reach but what did he come down as as a man humble as a man he was humble that he was born in an obscure and oppressed place he was born into poverty and despised by his people he didn't have to come and be born in a stable but because of his humility he found himself being born as a child in a stable he was humble think about this by submitting himself into obedience as a child in a household we have hard enough time telling our kids what to do and listening jesus finds himself having to be humble as a child he finds himself humble as he's learning to practice a trade as a carpenter he finds himself humble we can go on and on with the temptations he endured the temptations like that you and i have to go through because he didn't have to but the bible said he would have to take on all manner of temptations as man should take on and so there's jesus coming down in humility he was humble in the agony of his death think about the cross how humiliating that would be to be the king of glory and now you're wearing a crown of thorns now you're wearing a purple robe scarred with scarlet blood stains think of the agony and the humility and the shame as the public mocked him and humiliated him and he's enduring all this agony as a sacrifice on the cross what a humbling experience turn with me to luke if you would chapter 15. and here's where we'll base our second portion it's all going to tie together by god's grace luke chapter 15. very familiar parable a lot of times this portion is is uh not not preached on a lot this portion of it luke 15 and 8 and 9. and you're going to have to bear with me today because i've got a lot of reading i got a lot of quotes i've got a lot of prophecies i've got a lot of facts i got a lot of stuff that we're just gonna have to share to lay the foundation okay so stay with me luke chapter 15 verse eight and nine either what woman having ten pieces of silver she loses one piece does not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she had found it she called her friends and her neighbors together saying rejoice with me for i have found the peace which i had lost now when brother brown preached this message on luke 15 8-9 in 1957 he says this may seem like a very odd scripture for the second coming of christ but it's speaking of the second coming of christ and this great subject that we have here here before us now is one of the most vital subjects in the entire holy writ the second coming of christ and a lot of times we we we think that a lot of times it's the death burial and resurrection and those things are important but he goes on to say that this is one of the most important vital subjects of the entire holy writ there's nothing so important as the coming of the lord jesus for if it does not come we have been found as false witnesses if it does not come our dead that are in the graves they're perished if it does not come there's no hope left for us if jesus does not visibly come the second time and he said in very this light in this very light of the second coming is so important and he's preaching this around easter so he's talking about the holy week of easter coming up and so forth he says as it's approaching that jesus when he was approaching at the very first time the shadows of the cross he spoke very little of his death burial and resurrection and he spoke more on his second coming than he did his death burial and resurrection he says so in the light of this it's a very important subject [Music] i never really thought about it i never really realized it until i read that that jesus spoke very little of the death burial and resurrection but time numerous times over and over and over he speaks about his coming back and his return because it's such a special day and a main event in the history of the gospel the second coming of the rapture of christ he says they can come at any time he said now i could miss that by a year i could miss it by 20 years i could miss it by a hundred years let me stop and let me stop this just comes to me and i want to you know people want to debate the prophet the prophecies the message there's no debate to be had the things i'm about to read you was preached in 1960 and we know the things that were said were before that in 1930 or 19 back in early days when the prophecies went forth but people want to try to debate they want to try to find a loophole they want to find some way that this stuff don't line up and my thought to you this morning is there's nothing that lines up any closer there's nothing that comes even close to being able to there's nobody ever spoken words in 1940 1950 1960 that could be what we're looking at today like this message right here and so that to me there's no debate to be had so listen as we read these i could miss it by 20 years a year or 20 years i could miss it by 100 years i don't know where i like his honesty that's what tells me that this is genuine because he can honestly when he don't when he honestly doesn't know he'll tell you he honestly doesn't know when it's a prediction versus a prophecy there's a big difference there and he says but i'll predict according to the vision and and and the way things are progressing i say it'll be sometime between 33 and 77. he said at least this great nation is going to strike a war and that's how it's going to blow it to bits he said it's pretty close it's awful close i could be wrong i'm predicting everybody understand that amen he said but the lord showed me a vision of a great powerful woman in 33 on paper and he said roosevelt would help cause the war the world to go into a war these these things i'm fixing to tell you are important to the next half of the script or the service so listen close how mussolini would make an invasion into ethiopia and he would take it but he would come to a disgraceful end and how that the three isms nazism fascism communism would all wind up in communism and how there are here remember remember how many here remembers uh me saying that and i tell you watch russia watch russia king of the north watch russia watch russia king of the north he says again watch russia king of the north how many has heard me say it he said you owe timer see back there in the early part of the church watch russia king of the north and see what he would do for all those islams heap up into russia he said now this nation would finally go to war with germany and germany would build the concrete wall you know all that happened to took place the americans would take an awful beating at that line and the brethren at the time of the roy roberson and them and asked what happened uh he said but finally i said we'll we will overcome and we'll be the winner in the war between us and germany talking about the world war ii he said now at that time as science would really progress they did make an atomic bomb and everything i said during their progression they would make cars that began to constantly begin to shape like an egg and why don't we hear these things preached on much anymore i can remember hearing these things preached on when i was 17 18 20 25 but for somewhere down the road we've gotten kind of away from seeing the things that's been placed before us i see these cars as shaped like an egg and finally they will invent a car that won't have a steering wheel in it a scene he's seen a family going down the road in a glass top car great big fine looking roads and fine car has anybody seen the new tesla y model or the s model glass from front to back it's one big glass as far as you can see the whole thing and you know what it's kind of shaped like an egg i'm not saying tesla's what he saw but we're seeing what he saw and they were sitting there looking at one another and the car was running by itself and going right on around the curves and everything he said they've got the car now it's already invented he said they've got the car and he said oh how science will progress brother glenn just got a new vehicle one of them nice ones i like that vehicle we we just got us a new one and it is amazing and if any of you got any uh our old one was old one so i don't know maybe i don't know how how modern this technology is but we can hit cruise control and we go driving down the road then we hit another button that recognizes the lines on the road so if i veer over it tells me to get back well i can push another button and i can let go of the steering wheel and that thing will drive itself i said look at this just just went on for it went on for quite a while and then bbb please place your hands on the steering wheel oh okay but i didn't have to the car was doing it itself brother glenn yours do it if you're like me have you figured out those buttons yet but that goes to the next thing science is progressing technology is progressing science progresses in that day he said i seen now you don't you ladies don't get mad at me when i say this i'm just repeating what he said but when you look back you can see the truth they're going to permit women to vote and by voting they're going to elect the wrong man some of these days he said and you did that at the last election when the woman voted in kennedy and he said now you'll see crooked machines and things they fixed up and the fbi exposed it does anybody remember this last election [Applause] if if that don't strike a nerve right there fbi expose it and he said they won't do anything about it because they're afraid they'll lose their job that are rotten to the core so think about this think about what we're seeing taking place in front of us the very day that we're living in and brothers and sisters everything to the human race after the cross of calvary rests solemnly upon the second coming of the lord and there's religions all over the world and there's different motives and different objectives different theologies and christians but christians around the world should base it upon death burial resurrection and the second coming of the lord jesus christ living today in the shadows we i can't stress it enough and i'm going to say it over we are living in the shadows of the second coming of christ let's listen to this there's not one hope left for the church outside of the second coming the world in itself it's listen to this this this ain't even a word this wasn't even a word it's still not a word he used this word and my computer flagged it and said this is not this is not a word and i don't know if i can say it the way it's written the world is in its wild pandemonic condition did we just go through a panda pandemic did we just go through two years of covet two and a half years of a pandemic in the world he says in a wild have you ever lived such a wild experience we just went through as this panda pandemonic condition he says it has gotten completely out of control in every man-made organization of the world he says kings can't hold their kingdoms dignitaries can't hold their their dictators can't hold their people democracy can't hold people anymore there's nothing left but the second coming of the lord do you see the prophecies happening so let me challenge you this morning are we living the way we want to be living because if you agree with me that we're right at the brink of the greatest event that's ever happened since the existence of mankind and you claim to be a part of it you claimed you told me you claimed it are we where we want to be because he says it's the most horrible time for the unbeliever and the center that ever witnessed because the doom time is close at hand but it's the most blessed time for the believer it's the most blessed time for the people that believe the word of god and who live the word of god because there's two factors he says on this earth tonight the lord is coming to condemn one and he's coming to take away the other so where do you stand this morning he said if i want to know what time it was i'd look at my watch i said what we do we got an appointment we got somewhere important to be what time is it what time is it honey i got to be here what time is it oh let me see it's uh it's 15 until 12. is that right it's 15 to 12. he said if i if i want to know what day it was or what what day of the week it was or what month when he said i would look at a calendar and he said if i want to know the approaching the time of this great event i would look at the word of god he said and that tells me that time is at hand for the bible says when these things come to pass lift up your head your redemption is not time is at hand brothers and sisters we if we can't see how close we are i think we're probably as blind as bats i think god has allowed iphones technology cars these things that were prophesied he's allowed us to see him as an awakening to the hour we're living in and i thought to myself the other day how thankful when i said that the the the coming of the lord means more to me today than it ever has i thought how thankful should i be that this was revealed to me that i could see because churches all around the country churches all around the world do not have this knowledge or they don't accept this knowledge so there's soon there's coming a day that life will no longer exist as we know it the life will no longer matter you know those jobs you go to that you labor at they won't matter you know this body that you died all the time and you watch what you're eating you lifting weights and you run you're trying to get yourself in shape and you're trying to do all these things it won't matter all that money we're working hard to make it won't matter all that you try to do for organization and church that's what he said it don't matter you know i can remember it wasn't too long ago i had community-based services and organizations wanted me to serve on boards they want me to serve on this board and that board and and be a part of this organization to help push the community and so forth and so i was thinking i was serving on three boards uh and and and coaching baseball and doing those things you know what i found out those boards didn't matter i may be blackballed in the community if anybody sees that they try to do good work and they're doing good work for the community i'm here for that's not the work i'm sent to do so i had to let those boards go because those things are coming to a time that all of that stuff is about to vanish and jesus said they ask jesus what'll be the signs how will we know and he tells them he said here's what the sign will be he says the time will come when there will not be a stone left up on another you'll hear of war wars rumors of wars pestilence earthquakes and diverse places you see it's written it's right there for us to read in black and white but people don't want it because they think life matters when i say that i mean here your jobs your careers your accomplishments your money and we hear these things preached on over and over but so sometime down the road this is going to become a reality jesus began to speak to him he said the time will come wars rumors or pestilence earthquakes and divers places and he says when you see the fig tree putting forth its bud the jews now he says the jews have been scattered all around the world in great numbers millions in germany in italy united states all over the world and god as he did in the early days hardened pharaoh's heart he hardened mussolini's heart on the jews and the jews were ousted from italy he hardened hitler's heart they were ousted from germany he hardened stalin's heart and they were ousted from russia let me read you this current article in the jerusalem post as tensions between ukraine and russia began escalating in november some israeli officials said that they were preparing for a wave of mass immigration from ukraine were at least two hundred thousand who are eligible to immigrate to israel under its law of the law of return for jews for their relatives according to the european jury jewry you know those jews have to go home that's scriptural those jews have to go home and we don't understand why things happen maybe the way they did when you don't look through these eyes but when you look through these eyes you see the purpose of stalling you see the purpose it has nothing to do with a nation it has nothing to do with germany it has nothing to do with russia it has nothing to do with ukraine it has to do with god and israel and him getting his people where they should have never left in the first place it's all calling them back to a place so that the rapture can happen you are seeing prophecy scripture being fulfilled on a day-to-day basis he says now 62 years ago he said i have a picture at home and he said it's called by the scientist three minutes before midnight if the scientific world has said that the clock has went around until it's three minutes before midnight he said do you know what has anybody looked that up i looked it up i thought well if they had it back then i won't see what this thing looks like so it's the doomsday clock the scientists created 75 years ago and he's looking at this clock and it says they said because of the atomic powers that they've made he said that the atomic the oxygen the atomic and all those great powers they could harness and 62 years ago said we had three minutes left on the clock now this clock fluctuates depending on how things are going in the world okay so at some time back in i don't know maybe the uh early late 80s and 90s the clock went down to 17 things were pretty good according to scientists now i looked at it we're 100 seconds 100 seconds on today's world clock based on atomic powers based on leadership around the world listen now he says they've got enough power 62 years ago that they could harness they could completely cause the annihilation in five minutes time they could absolutely tonight there could not be one living person on the entire north american continent in 30 minutes now let me ask you does your job matter does the car you drive matter now i'm not teaching slothfulness i'm not telling you to any way you want and don't take care of your stuff and i'm not telling you that you go to work you try to do the better that's that's the way god intended it but in the grand scheme of things what matters is where you stand what matters is the life you're living he says because in 30 minutes time it's laying right in the bunch of hands of infidels who hate us they hate us he said and besides that we've got barges and ships set around all over siberia hungary in different places where our ships are sitting loaded with the same type of missiles just like that let me tell you putin's lost his mind listen 60 62 years ago they right in moscow could direct missiles guided by stars and radar they could exactly on 4th street in lowell if they wanted to you know that's not too far away i can be in louisville about two hours and those kind of bombs carry quite a punch he said what would happen my brother if that great missile turning would take place in this country and receive a shake and at the same hour we would turn loose of the same thing and shake it on the other side and we're living on a little bitty bitty tiny thin crust anyhow because the earthquakes have eaten away and hollowed out the earth he said it's hollowing out like an egg you ever tried to squeeze the egg that's full you can't hardly do it but you squeeze the egg that's had the yolk blown out of it you can just crush it easy and he says it's sitting there just like an egg and she'll make one big burst and then as eight thousand miles of thick lava will spew into the air and do exactly what god said would take place we're at the end time that's where we're at no way to stop it i don't know if i get uh concerned or chuckle a little bit or i don't know what what i feel when you talk these things to people and they act like this this part of the scripture don't exist they like jesus on a cross that forgives them of the bad things they do so that they can go out and do it again and get forgiven again but they don't want to hear the part where it all comes to a glorious sin there's very few people that are excited about what's happening but the bride of jesus christ is actually on this on the verge of excitement you know that bride when she's waiting in that chamber she's excited she's she's dressed herself she's got her garment on she's living with anticipation of the wedding and the marriage is fixing to happen and that bride is sitting there waiting for this and there's no way to stop it there's no minute they're going to get up there and says whoever thinks that they shouldn't get gary just now's your time to speak that's not going to happen nobody's stopping this marriage nobody's gonna stop this when it happens he says you can put a eisenhower in every country it'll never stop it the fig tree is putting forth her buds let me tell you this you can put a trump you know some people want to think trump is the answer to it all let me tell you what the prophet said no way to stop it well i've heard that before we've had wars before we thought that was going to be the end of the world we've we've seen all these things where we've had earthquakes that shook california we've had earthquakes we've had terrorist attacks that shook our nation we've had all this stuff so why when or why is it even going to happen it's going to happen let me tell you there's going to be a date there's going to be one time there's going to be that last earthquake there's going to be that last war there's going to be that last jew that goes back to israel it's going to happen be ready when it happens the prophet i was reading somewhere else he was talking about he was in california for some meetings and he was sitting in a barber shop and the jars and the canisters started to come off the shelf he said i got up and i run to find my wife he said this could be the last one so there's going to be a last one you said were you sure doom and gloom this morning and no i'm just trying to make sure my bags are packed i'm trying to make sure your bags are packed i'm trying to make sure this morning that we don't miss that trip because we we can't afford to miss that trip we can't afford to miss he said why don't you miss it we don't want to be here when these bombs start falling the bride will be gone before that first one hits on 4th street in louisville let me assure you of that just know where you're at because if anything in my life is out of place i want to find it if anything is out of place or i've lost something that i have to have to make that trip i want to find and i want you know jesus finds lost jesus is telling the story in the 15th chapter and he's explaining about the lost sheep to the pharisees and you remember they got angry at jesus they got angry at jesus because he was explaining about these lost sheep and they got angry because jesus sat down and ate with these people he went to the lost he went through those people and he ate with him and the pharisee said i can't believe that you would be around those such sinners as that and he started sharing a story about a foolish sheep a foolish sheep that had wandered off on his own now if i were to ask you to raise your hands how many foolish sheep have we had in here yeah both of mine go up this foolish sheep that had wandered away from the shepherd and it wandered off foolishly away from christ and away from the word of god and isaiah says all of us are like sheep that have gone astray so we can't point fingers there's no finger pointing this morning if you're looking at something look at yourself in the mirror and say where am i that's our challenge this morning and this this wandering sheep leaves out from the from the herd from the flock but you know god who's rich in mercy he couldn't stand to see that that little sheep over there wander all by he knew what was in store for that sheep and god goes down just like he has for you and for me and he goes down there because he's got a heart for the people and he pulls that little sheep back into the flock and nurtures them why is it sometimes when people leave church and they come back we have a grudge against them yeah it'll be a day of rejoicing when someone who has left or went out and done things and got into a position in their life and strayed away from god and god goes out and pricks their heart and pulls them back into the flock it'll be a day of rejoicing say another one is saved another one won't suffer destruction but sometimes we look at them through eyes like here they are i see you oh me but jesus finds lost things jesus didn't stop there with that lesson you know because these pharisees they were critical anything he said they want to criticize so they couldn't settle for what he had said in the example he just gave so he began to give another example there and he began to tell these religious leaders something else that he wanted them to see and he wants us to see and without taking a breath he goes right into the scenario about a woman who had 10 coins and she lost one of them now when we read this in the bible it reminds me of sophomore year of algebra martha had 10 coins and she can't find them all she lost one she gained two how many did martha have but when we read this story we begin to look at this and see what exactly happened because jesus looked at it and he says there's one missing because he called it the lost coin he said there's one missing you say well what's the big deal she's got nine more but there's something special about these coins it's more than just having a monetary value to these coins these coins that we're talking about shows that a woman was engaged or married they didn't wear wedding bands like we wear his brother brown said if a woman is married she should wear a wedding ring as a sign she's married he says that's to keep other men from having anything to do with her they look at her and they say she's a married woman in those days they didn't have wedding rings they had what called a tablet and they put it on their head ever seen the pictures of the women from the middle east they've got the band that runs across their head it's usually a golden band or something that's woven with gold threads and then it has little dangly things i thought that was to make those when they danced because you know they they like to dance and over there don't tell me you've never watched anything biblical movies where the women's always dancing but i thought it was to make a jingle no it's to signify that they're married it's to signify that they're engaged and so these coins they had on around their head told everybody i'm taking boys don't flirt with me and so here these these coins are that are around their head they had really no monetary value they could have been gold it could have been silver it could have been any kind of metal that there was it didn't really matter but it showed a site just like a legendary some people get one carrot some people get two cats some people get they carry it you get what you get you don't throw a fit so monetary value had no part with these coins and they got these right here placed around their forehead but these coins had certain value spiritually scripturally and the prophet said the first one was the coin meant the love to her husband the second one was a pledge a virtue to live clean for him the third fourth fifth ninth and tenth they all had things he said i don't have time to go into it look go to galatians 5 if you want to look it up fruits of the spirits where he's going with that he says his love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience the tablet was supposed to be worn in church brotherly love kindness godliness patience temperance knowledge virtue faith now are you with me and if we were to look back into the culture in the days of jesus we would see that these coins were so special they wasn't coins like we would just throw into a jar no they wasn't that kind of coin they had meaning i like my coins i'm the kind of guy that goes to the restaurant or whatever and if they say it's ten dollars from eleven dollars if i got a nickel in my pocket because i want my 95 cents back my wife's just opposite she'll dig out 99 pennies before she'll give them a dollar but i like my coins but that's not these kind of coins these coins were important sign of engagement just like the statue of a perfect man these virtues are important they signify something they announce to the world who you are just like it announced to the world this headdress of this ten coins announced i'm taking it this announces to the world we're taken [Music] so to lose one of these coins will be like you ladies losing your engagement ring boy do i have a story my wife takes hers off probably like most of you do when she cooks or whatever so she comes in i can't find my ring what was you doing patting out hamburger me that don't sound good we look and we look and we look and we find it that's where'd you put it she's always laying on top of the coffee maker that's where i always put it it's not there did you make coffee no i didn't make coffee i didn't i didn't know it didn't didn't lose it don't blame me so i go looking at a coffee maker and i look i look down inside this little crevice and how that ring got in that crevice i'll never know but i could see it down in there i fished it out good to go a few days later i'm eating at the table she's doing something over by the dishes and i almost choked and spit food everywhere because i see her ring laying on the floor and our dog is fixing to lick it and pick it up not good oh oh your ring okay i'm just about to spit food everywhere so she picks it up well how did i it's never come off my finger before i was just washing my hands i said it's cold out your hands are shrunken so my mom makes her this little dish that she can put her ring in now and it's set there so she can know where it's at and it shouldn't get knocked off but we go down to plant flowers the other day and i said you got your ring on yeah yeah i'm i'm making sure they'll come off somebody's gonna get a golden pot of flowers that's all i can say so the value the ring the tablet it would be like you lose your engagement ring so you can imagine why it makes complete sense that this woman once she sees that this coin is missing that she begins to tear her house completely apart upside down and the focus on this is not the woman the focus is on the coin jesus is not worried about the one he's worried about the coin she's lost and jesus is trying to point this out to the to the people to the pharisees he's talking to that this parable is about things that are lost because it signifies something in her life that she's either lost one her virtue she's lost uh her dignity and and keep in mind that jesus finds lost things don't forget that and he's drawing our attention to this lost coin you know sometimes monetary value versus heart value is a big difference because let me tell you if i lose one of these coins that's going to hurt i can't buy that it's taken years for me to get some of those coins and some of them i've just got a very small portion of so sentimental value these coins come through the trials you've been through these call you learn faith when you're in the gutter is that right you learn faith when you're in the gutter your virtue you learn that as you've been to grow in christ we get on out there to patients some of us are still just really really really thin on patients brotherly kindness let me move on brotherly kindness we've all got room to grow but i can tell you one thing under no circumstance i want to lose any of those because when i lose those my whole character changes well at least mine does if i begin to lose my brotherly love i find fault in people if i begin to lose my faith i can't overcome any obstacles if i lose my virtue i begin to live any way i want to live when i lose my knowledge i begin to doubt the word are you with me you see how important these are it's just like that woman that was so important and she was loaded out looking into me cleaning doing some things around the house and looks into a little looking glass that sees that coin's gone you see how subtle and how quick it jumps up on you listen to what this what he says visit again he said it was getting close tonight and close to dark and her husband will be coming home soon and if he found one of those coins listen you know what it meant it meant that she was marked as a harlot that puts a new meaning i'm not losing any of these don't it if it's all new meaning i'm not losing any of these she would be marked as a harlot it would show that she had been defiled and she would be seen by the people because her priest would come and and that seen and witnessed it and who the one who brought a witness would come to the priest and she if she was a married woman and he would take the tab the coin out of her tablet so that everybody she come in contact with would know what she'd been doing if she'd been out flirting showing she wasn't true to her husband they took it out and when the husband come home and found that she would be marked he would divorce her immediately and had nothing to do with such a woman he did not want such a woman you know christ is coming back for a bride that wears that tablet and if we're not following that tablet what are we marked as and if we lose one of those and christ comes out and he says ah you look really good except for put whatever you struggle with so that shows us the important and the prophet said it's better for the church to be examining ourselves and to see our purity to see our loyalty to see our devotion because all most of the world he says that you look and he said you look at the rest of the world in the christian church and they're associating with things out in the world and you can hardly tell one from the other this is what distinguishes us one from the other this is what when you walk out on a day-to-day basis that people can say hey that person's different that person is different they believe they have faith he said i've never seen such faith as in a person as that you know i seen a guy the other day he talks about about that guy but he just went up and he called him brother and told him he loved him how many times let's just go on how much easier is it to say hey you're doing me wrong you knock your teeth out that's what happens when you don't have that statue he says the church is lollying around and the church has no conscience anymore you can't hardly wake them up and it says the bible said they would come into that condition when they would say lo our lord delays is coming and they'll be devouring abiding at one another and so forth and fighting around we don't have that and we don't want that how do we keep that from happening follow the statue no doubt when this woman sees this coin missing out of her tablet it says she immediately lit a candle and she grabbed her broom brother says i think we got some people that need to light a candle and grab a broom around the message around churches because she knew what was coming so she got her can you imagine i imagine every candle in the house was burning every light in the house was on and i imagine the dust was fine as she was trying to find this coin so that she could replace it into her tablet we need people that are willing to search and fight and dig and do whatever it takes to get that stature [Music] she sweeps the whole house out searching it with tooth and cone a fine-tooth comb i should say turning the house upside down she didn't look for it like some of us men look for things honey where's this at it's in the cabinet i don't see it it's right there on the second shelf shelf i don't see it you're looking right at it where somebody had that happen this week it looks like no she swept she was diligent she was working hard i've got to find it i've got to find it and if we as christians and believers would get that in our mind we've got to have it we've got to have it we've got to find it we've got to possess it in our in our possession our lives would be different [Music] this woman depicts the holy spirit the holy spirit is what makes you dig and what guides us and leads us and gives us that makes us look for these things the holy spirit is what pricks our heart and says you don't have brotherly kindness the holy spirit is what pricks our heart and says you need more patience you're short with people your temper's too short your fuse is just about this long we need to lengthen it out that's the holy spirit that works and draws towards men and aren't you thankful when the holy spirit pricks your heart and you can come right back and pick up right where you left off you can find it it's sitting there waiting for you but what a lot of times people do they get away they stray or they they do some of this stuff on the statue of a perfect man they really they get out there and they're doing things that they shouldn't be doing they get it back and they're like well i'm home i'm returned that's all you ever hear of it that's not what it says she done this woman when she found this coin with virtually no value monetary it says that she found it she called her friends she called her neighbors and she said rejoice with me i have found my coin so why don't we do that find ourselves this morning begin to praise god a little bit more for the things in our lives thank you god for giving me faith thank you god for giving me patience thank you god for all the virtues thank you god for godliness because the world is missing godliness thank you god for love so that little coin we said yeah she had nine what did she need one more for had no value right we didn't determine whether it was gold silver it didn't matter what it was made of let me tell you you've got to have every one of these and one is no more valuable than the other and you say well i i know i don't have as much faith as brother so and so he can pray and stuff happens it didn't say you had to have abundant it didn't say you have to have every one of those has to be in complete perfection you just gotta have some the woman next to her all her template may have been solid 14 karat 21 karat gold and hers may have just been hand beaten silver but she had it so don't look at this and think i can never achieve it because i'm not here i don't have love i don't have enough love if you've got just an ounce of love you're on the right track keep building on it keep growing on it keep doing those things and when you get it why don't we look at this thing as we look at this whole situation this tablet and the world it's in why don't we look at this and just say well let's just have a heavenly celebration a heavenly jubilee so this morning talking about this tablet maybe you don't feel like much you don't look like much maybe you don't have a whole full row of coins in your tablet you've lost it somewhere jesus finds lost things all you've got to do is ask you see how simple it is get your broom out light your candle it may cost you a work it may cost you a little dedication it may cost you a little commitment but whatever you do don't you miss it we've determined what the hour we're living in we've determined by prophecy by scripture we're close you say well i heard that 16 20 30 years ago that means we're 30 years closer i tend to believe that when that coin fell off of her headdress off that tablet god knew exactly where it landed because god don't lose things he's not like me when i lay my keys down somewhere and i can't remember or i lay something down that's not god he finds lost things let's stand to our feet if the bible says his eye is on the sparrow he's watching over you if the bible tells us every hair of your head is counted he knows you so he knows where you are this morning i don't have to ask i don't have to make an altar call it's not necessary because you know where you stand you know the life you're living you know the hour that we're living in so you know if you need to get your light out and you know if you need to get your broom out and start cleaning house let's bow our heads heavenly father we're so thankful this morning to have a revelation of the world around us so many are roaming in darkness so many are wondering what's going to happen next so many are fearful of what's about to happen in this world but lord i i want to be like that little woman that went to searching for that coin this morning if i know there's something that's not right in my life if i know there's something that's not lining up with you and i've lost that fire i've lost that the the joy of my salvation if i've been back slit or if i've just slipped some on you lord i want to find it i want to work hard lord i want to to sweep the house clean i want to turn it upside down to be able to find that coin because whatever happens lord i need these stature on this poster behind me lord i need that statue of a perfect man i need to know that i know because the hour is at hand i want to be just like that woman when she found that coin all fear was gone because lord if we know that we're living in the statue of a perfect man if we possess those statures it describes us it tells our character it tells our life it's placed before the people and all fear is gone and i know with those virtues the statue of a perfect man i know that i can walk through life with that peace that passes all understanding knowing that you're coming back for your bride lord we love you this morning if there's anybody here that would just in your seats you just want to say lord i feel like i've lost part of my christian walk i feel like i've lost part of my experience i don't feel like i've got the faith that i once had i don't feel like i've got the love i once had i don't feel maybe i've got the virtue that i once had and you just want to slip your hand up to the lord this morning god bless those hands that's being honest before god knowing [Music] that you desire a closer walk with him that you desire in your heart to be in the stature of a perfect man lord we thank you lord for the service we thank you for honest hearts this morning we thank you for the word the revelation of the hour the message of the hour we thank you for a prophet [Music] we thank you lord that you won't lose a one we love you lord in jesus name amen the way he wants me to live i
