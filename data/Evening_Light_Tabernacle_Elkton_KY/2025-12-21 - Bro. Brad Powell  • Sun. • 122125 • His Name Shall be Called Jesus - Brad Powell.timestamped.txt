[46:52] radant
[46:56] from hell. my holy face
[47:02] with

[47:06] of redeeming

[47:12] Jesus
[47:15] Lord
[47:16] at thy birth.
[47:22] Jesus,
[47:25] Lord,
[47:26] at thy birth.
[47:32] Amen. Good morning.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Morning.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just greet each one of you in
[47:40] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[47:42] want to welcome all our visitors. This
[47:43] is good to have each one. Brother
[47:45] Tommy's dad back there. God bless you.
[47:47] Amen. Just different ones. And so, Amen.
[47:50] We're looking forward to what the Lord
[47:51] has for us. We are certainly amend this
[47:54] kind of a special time. Amen. Because
[47:57] this is the time of the year I guess for
[47:59] centuries now that we've celebrated the
[48:02] birth of Christ. Amen. We know he was
[48:04] probably born in April and so forth, but
[48:06] Amen. It's quite something just to think
[48:09] that and and I'll just bear with me for
[48:13] a minute. Musicians and I told Troy I
[48:15] would just not have Bible reading this
[48:17] morning because I had just had something
[48:18] kind of come on my heart. Amen. that I
[48:21] want to share. Amen. Would that be okay?
[48:22] So, we'll just have a little something.
[48:24] Amen. It just came to me, you know,
[48:26] about
[48:29] um
[48:30] if there really is a Christmas,
[48:33] there really was a Christmas.
[48:37] There really was a time when God became
[48:40] flesh, Emanuel, and dwelt among us.
[48:43] Amen.
[48:45] They brought tidings of great joy.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:51] and we sing about it and we celebrate
[48:52] it. It's just as sure. Even our
[48:56] calendar,
[48:58] our time testifies
[49:00] that God came to the earth and died for
[49:02] us because our calendar is programmed
[49:05] from the death of Christ, isn't it?
[49:08] &gt;&gt; So even our calendar testifies that God
[49:10] came the first time.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; And if he really did,
[49:15] then praise the Lord, we know that
[49:18] forgiveness is real. There really is
[49:20] forgiveness.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't none of us perfect. We all have
[49:24] done a bunch of bad stuff in our life.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Things we that haunt us perhaps things
[49:30] we don't like.
[49:33] But guess what?
[49:34] &gt;&gt; That's what he died for. He came to
[49:36] forgive.
[49:38] Thank God for forgiveness.
[49:42] Amen. That's what he did. When he died,
[49:45] we lived. Living he loved me. dying, he
[49:48] saved me. Paid the price, rising,
[49:52] dejustified. In other words, Amen. He
[49:55] justified us when he rose from the dead.
[49:57] Amen.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; And not only that, but if there truly is
[50:02] forgiveness, then there's also truly an
[50:06] infilling of God himself in our hearts
[50:09] &gt;&gt; because he says, "I'll not leave you
[50:10] comfortless. I will come to you."
[50:13] &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[50:15] salvation is real.
[50:17] Christmas is real.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Then forgiveness is real.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Salvation is real.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; And it's real that if I go away, I will
[50:27] come again. How many believes God Jesus
[50:30] is coming again?
[50:34] &gt;&gt; He is coming again.
[50:37] And if Christmas is real,
[50:39] then there's a heaven to go to.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[50:43] &gt;&gt; There's a heaven to go to.
[50:46] And there's a hell to stay away from.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; And you have to make a choice in this
[50:52] life which one you want to go to, where
[50:56] you want to go.
[50:58] Amen. And so I thought that's real. How
[51:01] many believes all of those things are
[51:02] real?
[51:04] And in Mark, I like this
[51:08] in St. Mark after he rose again. Amen.
[51:12] This is kind of a resurrection story.
[51:15] Brother Brad will bring us the Christmas
[51:16] message, but I'll bring us a
[51:18] resurrection message this morning.
[51:20] Amen. Last chapter of Mark talks after
[51:23] Jesus was risen again, he was seen of
[51:25] different ones and after he appeared to
[51:27] all of his disciples, he upraded them
[51:28] for their unbelief unbelief and hardness
[51:31] of heart because they believed not the
[51:33] ones that had told him that he was
[51:34] risen. And he said to them, "Go ye into
[51:36] all the world and preach the gospel to
[51:39] every creature." Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; How many believe the preaching of the
[51:42] gospel? Amen. That there is forgiveness.
[51:44] There is salvation. There is redemption.
[51:47] That's the gospel. Go everywhere. Tell
[51:49] that you CAN COME BACK TO GOD. YOU DON'T
[51:51] have to be in this condition.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; God came to bring us reconciliation back
[51:56] to God the way that Adam was before the
[51:58] fall. He says, "Go into all the world
[52:00] and preach the gospel to every creature.
[52:02] He that believeth and is baptized shall
[52:05] be saved."
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that believeth not shall be
[52:09] damned. Amen. So my thought is
[52:14] the only the real sin the real sin is to
[52:19] not believe.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; To not believe God and the record that
[52:23] he gave of his son is enough to cast you
[52:28] into hell. Not your bad deeds, not all
[52:31] of that stuff. That's all attributes of
[52:34] you not believing. Because if you
[52:36] believed and got filled with the Holy
[52:37] Ghost, you stop all that.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Attributes of unbelief. The real
[52:42] sin is to not believe.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; That in itself will either save you. He
[52:47] that believeth, Amen, shall be saved. He
[52:50] that believeth not shall be damned.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Wow. So it's important to believe.
[52:56] One more scriptures I'll make it short.
[53:00] And that's found in
[53:02] first John 5 and verse 9. If we receive
[53:06] the witness of men, how many knows in a
[53:09] courtroom and so forth, if somebody
[53:10] gives witness something, we believe
[53:12] them.
[53:14] It's kind of hard to nowadays, but
[53:16] you're supposed to be able when to put
[53:17] the Bible hang on the Bible and say, "I
[53:20] swear to tell the truth." That witness
[53:22] is supposed to be good. Supposed to be.
[53:26] So if we receive the witness of men, the
[53:28] witness of God is greater. For this is
[53:30] the witness of God, which he hath
[53:32] testified of his son.
[53:35] He that believeth on the son of God hath
[53:37] the witness in himself, and he that
[53:39] believeth not, God hath made him a liar.
[53:43] In other words, somebody comes up and
[53:46] tell you says, and you say, I don't
[53:47] believe it. You're saying that you
[53:50] believe they're a liar.
[53:53] Not true. You're saying it ain't true.
[53:55] Don't believe it.
[53:58] Hath made him a liar because he has not
[54:01] believed the record that God gave of his
[54:04] son. How many believes Jesus came to
[54:07] earth?
[54:08] &gt;&gt; I believe Christmas. I believe that God
[54:09] did come to the earth
[54:11] &gt;&gt; to save us from our sins. Amen. Amen.
[54:16] And I don't just celebrate that during
[54:18] this season. Amen. We celebrate that all
[54:22] year around. Amen.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; So, I trust and believe and hope that
[54:27] everybody here believes God
[54:30] &gt;&gt; because if you don't believe God, you'll
[54:32] be damned for it. Amen. So, thank God
[54:35] for his grace and for his mercy.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. A merry Christmas
[54:40] to everybody.
[54:42] Amen. And just want to tell you that we
[54:44] love you. Looking forward to a good
[54:46] service and a good fellowship this
[54:47] afternoon together. Amen. So, we'll turn
[54:49] it over to brother David. God bless you.
[54:54] God bless you.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Let's stand this morning. Amen. How
[54:59] many's glad to be in the house of the
[55:00] Lord this morning?
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what an awesome time. What an
[55:05] awesome message this morning we've
[55:06] already heard. Amen. That was that was
[55:09] wonderful. You love him. Let's bow our
[55:11] hearts this morning. Heavenly Father, we
[55:12] come before you this morning.
[55:15] We just want to tell you we love you,
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Lord. Just to be in your presence this
[55:21] morning, Father.
[55:22] and be a recipient of your goodness and
[55:24] your grace and your mercy in our lives.
[55:26] Lord, we're very thankful this morning.
[55:28] And Lord, I pray you'll bless each and
[55:30] every one that's here this morning and
[55:32] those that couldn't be here this
[55:33] morning. I just pray, Father God, that
[55:35] you would be with them most of all and
[55:38] speak to their hearts. Be with those
[55:39] that are streaming this morning, our
[55:41] shutins. Lord, may you just come and
[55:44] anoint the service this morning once
[55:46] again. May you walk up and down the
[55:48] aisles and speak to our hearts, Lord. We
[55:50] pray in Jesus name. Amen. You love him
[55:53] with all your heart this morning. Amen.
[55:57] I've got several songs, but this song I
[55:59] wanted to sing. This is the day that the
[56:02] Lord has made. I will be sad. And no,
[56:05] that's not the way it goes. I will

[1:10:10] up to that?
[1:10:14] Oh, let your word come ahead choir be
[1:10:19] born
[1:10:21] in the manger of my heart.

[1:12:35] and the prophets spoke the word.

[1:12:43] Prepare the way of the Lord. And the
[1:12:47] angels told the shepherds.
[1:12:50] And the shepherds bowed to pray.

[1:14:22] And he conquered death and sin.

[1:19:35] fifth, the minor fall, the major lift.
[1:19:41] With every breath I'm singing halleluah,
[1:19:49] hallelu,
[1:19:54] hallelu,
[1:19:59] hallelu,
[1:20:04] hallelujah.
[1:20:10] Yeah.
[1:20:21] A couple came to Bethlehem
[1:20:26] expecting child. They searched the inn
[1:20:31] to find a place for you were coming
[1:20:36] soon.
[1:20:40] There was no room for them to stay. So
[1:20:45] in a manger filled with hay, God's only
[1:20:50] son was born. Oh halleluah.
[1:20:57] Hallelu.
[1:21:02] Hallelu.
[1:21:06] Hallelu.
[1:21:11] Hallelujah.
[1:21:28] The shephers left their flocks by night
[1:21:32] to see this baby wrapped in light. A
[1:21:38] host of angels led them all to you.
[1:21:46] was just as the angel said, you'll find
[1:21:52] him in a manger bed. Emmanuel

[1:22:38] Bethlehem.

[1:22:44] surely long for you.
[1:22:50] into the place at which you were. Their
[1:22:55] frankincense
[1:22:57] and golden myrr they gave to you and

[1:23:36] boy would grow to be a man and one day
[1:23:42] die for me and you.
[1:23:48] My sins would drive the nails in you.
[1:23:53] That rugged cross was my cross too. So

[1:27:48] Let's just bow our heads.
[1:27:52] Sweet Jesus, we just come before you,
[1:27:54] Lord.
[1:27:57] Lord, you're the high priest of our
[1:28:00] profession, Lord.
[1:28:03] when we submit and we surrender to your
[1:28:05] will, Lord, and then you lay on our
[1:28:08] hearts what to speak over ourselves and
[1:28:11] over our loved ones and over the rest of
[1:28:14] humanity. Jesus,
[1:28:16] this is the position you've put us in
[1:28:18] when we accept your word and we let you
[1:28:21] come and live inside of us.
[1:28:23] And so, Lord, we want to turn praise
[1:28:25] back to you for everything you've done
[1:28:28] and how you're moving
[1:28:30] and how we can see your glory and we can
[1:28:32] see your power moving down here in this
[1:28:36] world that's affected by sin and death
[1:28:38] and everything. And Lord, we're also
[1:28:41] coming. We're speaking life and we're
[1:28:42] speaking healing and we're speaking hope
[1:28:45] to the different prayer requests. Jesus,
[1:28:49] we were originally created, Lord, to be
[1:28:51] eternal and living with you. And then
[1:28:54] because of sin, then we're we're subject
[1:28:56] to all these negative things. But that's
[1:28:59] why that's why Christmas happened. So
[1:29:02] you could come and you could take the
[1:29:05] the punishment
[1:29:07] for all of that so that we could step
[1:29:09] back into our rightful position with
[1:29:11] you.
[1:29:12] And as
[1:29:14] sons and daughters of you,
[1:29:17] we we stand on your word and we take our
[1:29:20] position. And Lord, these different
[1:29:22] prayer requests,
[1:29:24] we thank you for them because they're
[1:29:27] your way of showing us how much you
[1:29:29] still love us. And it's your way of
[1:29:31] being able to move
[1:29:33] and just show your love to us. And so I
[1:29:37] ask that you'll move in these
[1:29:38] situations. We claim it, Lord. In your
[1:29:41] name. Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Let's look at the Let's sing that lorus
[1:29:46] again. Let your word be born as Emilyn
[1:29:48] gets ready to sing. Oh, let your word
[1:29:53] be born
[1:29:56] in the manger of my heart.
[1:30:01] Let it move in me.
[1:30:09] Hold me inside this house of clay
[1:30:14] and mold me every day.
[1:30:21] Be born
[1:30:23] in the manger
[1:30:26] of mine.
[1:30:50] Away
[1:30:51] in a manger,
[1:30:54] no crib for a bed.
[1:30:59] The little
[1:31:01] Lord Jesus
[1:31:04] lay down his sweet head. The stars in
[1:31:10] the sky
[1:31:13] looked down where he lay. The little
[1:31:19] Lord Jesus
[1:31:22] asleep on the hay.
[1:31:26] The cattle
[1:31:29] are lowing.
[1:31:31] The baby
[1:31:33] awakes.
[1:31:35] But little Lord Jesus,
[1:31:40] no crying
[1:31:42] he makes.
[1:31:44] I love thee, Lord Jesus.
[1:31:48] Look down from the sky
[1:31:53] and stay by my cradle
[1:31:57] till morning
[1:31:59] is night.
[1:32:02] Be near me, Lord Jesus.
[1:32:06] I ask thee to stay
[1:32:10] close by me forever
[1:32:15] and love me. I pray
[1:32:19] bless all the dear children in thy
[1:32:25] tender care
[1:32:28] and take us to heaven to live with thee
[1:32:35] there.
[1:32:37] and take us to heaven to live with thee
[1:32:44] there.
[1:32:54] Amen. I pray the song service has been a
[1:32:56] blessing to you this morning. And I told
[1:32:59] him I'd be willing to cut my part short.
[1:33:01] And sometimes I don't do a very good job
[1:33:02] of that. But we got one more thing to do
[1:33:05] before we ask brother Brad to come out.
[1:33:07] And
[1:33:09] you know, and we have a
[1:33:14] a pastor that we love very much
[1:33:19] and his wonderful wife. Bless her heart
[1:33:22] for putting up with him. But anyways,
[1:33:25] no, we love Brother Thomas and Sister
[1:33:28] Donna very much. And
[1:33:35] this has been a special year for our
[1:33:36] church.
[1:33:40] Through many trials
[1:33:42] and tests, we've come.
[1:33:45] But guess what? We're a winner today.
[1:33:48] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:33:50] praise this morning. Amen. Come ahead.
[1:33:52] Come up here, Sister Donna.
[1:33:55] Amen. And I know she don't really like
[1:33:57] to come up here, but that's okay. I get
[1:34:00] to embarrass her once a year. So, we
[1:34:03] love him very much. Come ahead, Brother
[1:34:04] Thomas. God bless you. We love you,
[1:34:06] buddy. Come on up here, Sister Donna.
[1:34:09] Amen. God bless you.
[1:34:14] That's for Brother Thomas. And sister
[1:34:16] Donna, you don't have to tell him how
[1:34:17] much we gave you this year.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you'all very much. I just
[1:34:24] want to say amen. It has been a special
[1:34:27] year, you know, because about a month
[1:34:30] ago, November the 6th, I think it was a
[1:34:33] year ago is when my wife was diagnosed
[1:34:36] with force
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; stage four.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anyway, so I didn't do it, but I
[1:34:48] thought about November 6. Um,
[1:34:52] you know, it's was one year that, you
[1:34:54] know, they had pretty much send her home
[1:34:56] said nothing we can do other than make
[1:34:58] you comfortable.
[1:35:01] But by God's grace,
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; the Lord said no.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:10] Amen.
[1:35:13] Amen. And we believe it's going out of
[1:35:15] the lymph nodes, out of the lungs, and
[1:35:17] Amen. It's just going away. Amen. And
[1:35:19] we're so grateful that she's up to
[1:35:21] strength and feeling good and reclaiming
[1:35:24] their complete healing. Amen. It's all
[1:35:26] going to be gone. Amen. God bless you.
[1:35:28] Amen. Love you, baby.
[1:35:34] Amen.
[1:35:36] God is good, isn't he?
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand this morning. And I
[1:35:41] want to sing that song as Brother Brad
[1:35:43] comes. Oh, come all ye faithful this
[1:35:45] morning. Amen.
[1:35:48] Oh come
[1:35:50] all ye faithful
[1:35:54] joyful and triumphant.
[1:35:59] Oh come,
[1:36:02] oh come ye to be deathly hand.
[1:36:11] Come and behold
[1:36:14] him born the king of.
[1:36:21] Oh come let us adore
[1:36:25] him. Oh come let us adore
[1:36:31] him.
[1:36:34] You want colder?
[1:36:37] I'll get you one right here.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; The Lord
[1:36:44] sings
[1:36:46] of angels
[1:36:50] sing
[1:37:01] heaven.
[1:37:06] Glory
[1:37:08] to God.
[1:37:12] Glory in the highest.
[1:37:16] Oh come let us adore
[1:37:21] him. Come let us adore
[1:37:27] him. Oh come let us adore
[1:37:32] him.
[1:37:34] Christ
[1:37:38] our Lord.
[1:37:41] Amen. He's certainly worthy to be adored
[1:37:43] this morning. You know, thinking about
[1:37:46] Christmas and
[1:37:48] Christmas, you know, is not about a it's
[1:37:50] not about a party. It's not about a
[1:37:52] celebration. It's not not about
[1:37:53] exchanging gifts, but it's about
[1:37:56] worship. It's about thanksgiving.
[1:37:59] It's about about praising God for what
[1:38:02] God has done. It's about praising God
[1:38:04] for sending his son, his only begotten
[1:38:06] son, that whosoever will believe on him
[1:38:09] should have everlasting life. That's
[1:38:12] what Christmas is about.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Certainly good to be in the house of the
[1:38:16] Lord this morning. And Roy, Kimberly,
[1:38:19] good to have y'all here. I tell you
[1:38:21] what, we've had prayer for Roy. If y'all
[1:38:23] y'all heard us talk about Roy, we've had
[1:38:25] prayer. He's battling a very familiar
[1:38:28] battle that's a lot of our believers
[1:38:30] around the world have had to fight. But
[1:38:33] you know what? He's still in the battle.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; He's still fighting. We're still
[1:38:37] believing God.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Moving on the scene.
[1:38:42] Praise the Lord. Good to have you here.
[1:38:44] We love you guys.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; So, if you would turn in your Bibles as
[1:38:47] you're turning there and we'll turn to
[1:38:49] Isaiah chapter 7.
[1:38:52] Doing things a little different this
[1:38:54] morning. And you probably noticed and
[1:38:56] you know I've always been a paper pencil
[1:38:58] guy and I usually use a headset but I'm
[1:39:01] using an iPad today and a microphone. So
[1:39:05] uh oh could be right. Uh oh could be
[1:39:08] right. I've got pages in the back
[1:39:10] printed off. Don't don't think I didn't
[1:39:12] come prepared. So um we do want to look
[1:39:14] here in Isaiah chapter 7 and and verse
[1:39:18] 14. And while you're turning there I
[1:39:20] want to just take a little thought here.
[1:39:22] You know, Brother Ber said I'd be
[1:39:23] bringing the Christmas message. And this
[1:39:24] is a Christmas message, but it's it's
[1:39:26] it's a little bit different than
[1:39:28] probably a Christmas message you've
[1:39:29] heard before, but we want to just speak
[1:39:31] on it. The prophet tells us this as
[1:39:33] we're as you're turning. What is every
[1:39:35] name? He says, "Every name of every
[1:39:38] person will bear the name of what?"
[1:39:40] Jesus. He says, "The whole heaven is
[1:39:42] named Jesus. The whole church is named
[1:39:46] Jesus." Everything is named Jesus. For
[1:39:49] it's the only name that God ever had.
[1:39:52] He's called Jehovah. Jehovah Gyra, the
[1:39:55] Lord's provider, the Lord's sacrifice.
[1:39:57] Jehovah Rafa, the Lord that health thee.
[1:40:00] Jehovah, the Lord's banner. Manassth.
[1:40:03] Jehovah, the different Jehovah's. He's
[1:40:05] called the morning star. He's called the
[1:40:07] Father. He's called the Son. He's called
[1:40:09] the Holy Ghost. He's called the O Alpha
[1:40:12] and the Omega. He's called the beginning
[1:40:15] and he's called the ending. He's called
[1:40:17] the branch. Oh, he's called all kinds of
[1:40:20] titles, but he has one name.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; But he has one name. He says the father,
[1:40:25] father is not a name. Son is not a name.
[1:40:27] Holy Ghost is not a name. It's a title
[1:40:30] to a name. He says it's the name of
[1:40:32] three attributes that belong to one God.
[1:40:35] What was his name? The angel said, "Thou
[1:40:38] shalt call his name,
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus. For he shall save his people from
[1:40:45] their sins." Yeah.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 7:14.
[1:40:50] Therefore, the Lord himself give unto
[1:40:52] you to you a sign. Behold, a virgin s
[1:40:55] shall conceive and bear a son, and shall
[1:40:58] call his name Emmanuel. Now, we know
[1:41:00] that means God with us. Isaiah chapter
[1:41:03] 9, if you'll turn a couple pages there,
[1:41:06] verse six.
[1:41:09] For unto us a child is born, unto us a
[1:41:14] son is given, and the government shall
[1:41:17] be upon his shoulders, and his name
[1:41:19] shall be called Wonderful, Counselor,
[1:41:23] the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father,
[1:41:25] the Prince of Peace. One more place as
[1:41:28] we lay our foundation. Matthew chapter
[1:41:30] 1. I'll give you a second there. Matthew
[1:41:34] chapter 1.
[1:41:38] Matthew chapter 1 verse 18.
[1:41:41] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on the
[1:41:43] wise when he when as his mother Mary was
[1:41:46] a spouse to Joseph before they came
[1:41:49] together she was found with child of the
[1:41:52] Holy Ghost. Notice this wasn't child of
[1:41:54] a Jew. It wasn't child of a Gentile. It
[1:41:56] wasn't child of an Egyptian or somebody
[1:41:59] from Arabia. This was a child of the
[1:42:02] Holy Ghost. Then Joseph, her husband,
[1:42:04] being a just man and not willing to make
[1:42:06] her public example, was minded to put
[1:42:08] her away privately. So here he is. Now,
[1:42:11] Joseph is going to save her from the
[1:42:13] humility of the of the community. He's
[1:42:15] going to save her from being mocked.
[1:42:17] He's going to save her from being made
[1:42:19] fun of and disgraced by the people for
[1:42:22] the condition that she finds herself in.
[1:42:25] But while he thought on these things,
[1:42:27] behold, the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:42:29] unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph,
[1:42:32] thou son of David, fear not to take
[1:42:34] thee, Mary, thy wife, for that which is
[1:42:37] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost,
[1:42:41] and she shall bring forth a son, and you
[1:42:44] shall call his name
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Isn't that amazing?
[1:42:49] We're going in from the Old Testament to
[1:42:51] the New Testament. Emmanuel. Jesus. You
[1:42:55] shall call his name Jesus, for he shall
[1:42:57] save his people from their sins. Now all
[1:42:59] this was done that it might be fulfilled
[1:43:01] which was spoken of in the Lord by the
[1:43:03] prophet, saying, "Behold, a virgin shall
[1:43:05] be with child and shall bring forth a
[1:43:07] son, and they shall call his name
[1:43:09] Emmanuel, which is being interpreted as
[1:43:12] God with us." I want to speak this
[1:43:14] morning if we could entitle my message,
[1:43:16] "His name shall be called Jesus." Let's
[1:43:19] pray. Heavenly Father, we come before
[1:43:21] you this morning with grateful hearts.
[1:43:23] Thankful, Lord, just to be in your house
[1:43:24] once again and to serve you during this
[1:43:28] uh special time of the year and we just
[1:43:30] want to take a time today just to
[1:43:31] worship you, Lord. We've heard songs of
[1:43:33] praise. We've heard songs of gratitude
[1:43:35] and songs of worship, Lord. So we just
[1:43:38] ask Lord as when now we open the bread
[1:43:40] of life in the word as we begin to
[1:43:42] minister the word that it would just
[1:43:44] sink down into our hearts to help us to
[1:43:46] realize the true meaning of this season
[1:43:49] we call Christmas. Lord, we're so
[1:43:51] thankful that you sent your son to die.
[1:43:54] You sent your son to as a redeemer for
[1:43:57] the lost. You sent your son as a
[1:43:58] deliverer for those in in need of
[1:44:00] deliverance. We just want to tell you we
[1:44:02] love you. We appreciate you Lord and
[1:44:04] give you honor, praise, and glory. and
[1:44:06] may everything be said be pleasing to
[1:44:08] your ears today, Lord, in Jesus name.
[1:44:10] Amen. You can have your seats.
[1:44:16] We're going to try to not hold you long.
[1:44:17] We've had a lot of preliminaries and we
[1:44:19] got the the the dinner afterwards, but
[1:44:21] we do want to take our time to worship.
[1:44:24] We want to take our time to lay the word
[1:44:25] out and to worship what God has done for
[1:44:27] us. And looking at this scripture here,
[1:44:29] we see that 700 years after the
[1:44:32] prophecy, now think about that. 700
[1:44:34] years after the prophecy in the book of
[1:44:36] Isaiah, we have a young virgin girl here
[1:44:39] from Nazareth whose name was Mary. Now,
[1:44:42] she's engaged to this young carpenter
[1:44:43] boy. And so, as they're going through
[1:44:45] about their daily life, before they're
[1:44:48] married, an angel visits Joseph and
[1:44:50] comes to Joseph and says, "I want to
[1:44:53] confirm with you that Mary has conceived
[1:44:55] a child."
[1:44:59] Now, think about this.
[1:45:01] An angel of the Lord comes to me and
[1:45:02] says,"I want to confirm with you and let
[1:45:04] you know, Joseph, that Mary, the one
[1:45:06] you're espouseed to Mary, that she IS
[1:45:09] NOW WITH A child with the Holy Spirit."
[1:45:13] Now listen, Joseph, NOW I KNOW THIS MAY
[1:45:15] CONFOUND YOU. You may not understand
[1:45:17] what's going on, but you will call his
[1:45:18] name Jesus.
[1:45:21] Clear instructions. Clear instructions.
[1:45:24] in Matthew. When we look into Matthew,
[1:45:26] we understand that the fulfillment of
[1:45:28] Isaiah's prophecy is delivering an
[1:45:31] inspired revelation. And all of this is
[1:45:34] taking place from what the prophets had
[1:45:36] said 700 years ago. Yeah.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; So now we SEE THAT THE GOD of the Old
[1:45:42] Testament who had revealed himself in
[1:45:44] word form, the God who had demonstrated
[1:45:47] himself and carried himself in his work
[1:45:50] through the letter of the law and
[1:45:52] through written revelation to the people
[1:45:54] of that day. We're talking about a God
[1:45:57] who who who led the children of Israel
[1:45:59] into the promised land as a cloud by day
[1:46:01] and a fire by night.
[1:46:04] This very same God 700 years later is
[1:46:07] now going TO BE BIRTHED INTO A BODY OF
[1:46:09] FLESH.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO COME INTO A BODY OF FLESH.
[1:46:14] AND IN THIS BODY of flesh, a form of a
[1:46:16] man, a man that would be tested, A MAN
[1:46:19] THAT WOULD BE tried in every way you can
[1:46:21] imagine. A MAN THAT WOULD FEEL PAIN. A
[1:46:24] man that could get emotional.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; A man WHO WOULD CRY. A man who would
[1:46:30] hurt. a man who would have concern for
[1:46:32] those around him.
[1:46:34] He's not a god back in the laws anymore.
[1:46:38] NOW HE'S GOING TO COME INTO and he's
[1:46:39] going to BE THIS MAN. A MAN THAT COULD
[1:46:42] RESIST all temptations.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; A man that would come onto the scene and
[1:46:49] be tested and tried IN ALL WAYS. JUST
[1:46:51] LIKE YOU AND ME, Brother Tommy, just
[1:46:52] like you and me, Brother Troy. Just like
[1:46:55] you and me. He's going to be tested.
[1:46:56] He's going to be tried. He's going to go
[1:46:58] through these things. BUT THIS MAN WOULD
[1:47:01] overcome the world as WE KNOW IT BECAUSE
[1:47:03] HIS NAME WAS JESUS.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE DEFINITION OF WHAT IT MEANS
[1:47:12] TO LIVE A VICTORIOUS LIFE.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THAT DEFINITION. THE WORD TELLS
[1:47:18] US IN JOHN chapter 16 that Jesus has
[1:47:21] overcome the world.
[1:47:24] There is not a single THING THAT WE CAN
[1:47:25] ABSOLUTELY go through OR POSSIBLY GO
[1:47:28] THROUGH THAT JESUS HAS NOT ALREADY
[1:47:30] OVERCOME.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; So brothers and sisters, as believers
[1:47:35] and as followers of Christ and the
[1:47:36] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, WE ARE GOING TO
[1:47:39] FACE TRIBULATIONS.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO FACE TRIALS. WE'RE GOING
[1:47:43] TO FACE TEMPTATIONS. WE'RE GOING TO FACE
[1:47:46] ALL THESE THINGS, HARDSHIPS
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOUR EMOTIONS ARE
[1:47:52] GOING TO GET THE BEST OF YOU.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; YOUR HUMAN SIDE, BROTHER BER, IS GOING
[1:47:59] TO SOMETIMES GRAB AND GET A HOLD OF US
[1:48:01] and it's going to GET THE BEST OF YOU.
[1:48:03] YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF ON OCCASION
[1:48:05] having a little temper tantrum.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; You say, "CHRISTIANS DON'T DO THAT."
[1:48:10] YES, THEY DO. What world do you live in?
[1:48:14] Yeah,
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; some of you's laughing. Some of you's
[1:48:17] looking at your husband. Some of you is
[1:48:18] looking at your wife. Some of you is
[1:48:19] looking at your neighbor.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Every now and then, ANGER MIGHT JUST
[1:48:25] RISE UP FROM TIME TO TIME.
[1:48:28] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DAYS WHERE YOU'RE
[1:48:29] GOING TO HAVE DOUBTS.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FEARS. YOU'RE GOING
[1:48:33] TO HAVE SICKNESSES THAT MAY COME ON YOUR
[1:48:35] WAY. YOU MAY HAVE SICKNESSES THAT WILL
[1:48:37] MAKE YOU WONDER, "AM I EVER going to
[1:48:39] make it through this?" Yeah.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; BUT PRAISE BE TO GOD THIS MORNING THAT
[1:48:44] CHRIST HAS A VICTORY.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; JESUS CAME AND HE'S VICTORIOUS OVER SIN,
[1:48:50] DEATH, HELL, GRAVE, WORLD through all
[1:48:54] the worldly troubles and everything that
[1:48:56] could that come come onto the believer.
[1:48:58] HE GIVE US A WAY OUT.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE THAT? BECAUSE OF JESUS
[1:49:03] and that beautiful name of Jesus, the
[1:49:05] believer today can have peace.
[1:49:08] The believer today can have courage. The
[1:49:10] believer today can have hope and
[1:49:12] assurance AND KNOWING THAT WE ARE NOT
[1:49:15] ALONE. BUT THAT the victory can be had
[1:49:17] THROUGH CHRIST WHO DIED ON CALVARY.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Listen church. The victory
[1:49:28] the victory doesn't remove the hardship.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we would love for it to.
[1:49:37] But the victory does not remove the
[1:49:40] hardship. The victory is there as a
[1:49:43] conquest. The victory is empowering
[1:49:46] believers to find a peace amongst life's
[1:49:49] challenges. THAT THROUGH THIS TRIUMPH,
[1:49:52] HIS TRIUMPH, we can find ourselves
[1:49:54] remembering that in the valley there's a
[1:49:58] mountain.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT THE VALLEY, there is no
[1:50:01] mountain.
[1:50:03] And every day that we get up and every
[1:50:05] day we we get oursel up out of bed, we
[1:50:07] have to realize that without a battle,
[1:50:09] there is no victory.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; And when we talk about Jesus coming down
[1:50:13] onto the scene and we talk about JESUS
[1:50:15] COMING INTO FLESH, HE STEPPED DOWN FROM
[1:50:17] HEAVENLY brothers and sisters,
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; he stepped in from a heavenly realm into
[1:50:21] an earthly realm
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; to fight the battle for you and for me.
[1:50:31] Do you realize what he gave up? He said,
[1:50:34] "Your ways are not my ways. You don't
[1:50:35] think like I think. I don't think like
[1:50:36] you think. Heavenly. You don't think
[1:50:38] heavenly thoughts. I don't think earthly
[1:50:40] thoughts.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; I'm a heavenly being." Jesus said, "And
[1:50:44] yet I'm going to come down to the earth
[1:50:46] and I'M GOING TO FIGHT your battles for
[1:50:48] you."
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; I like the way the prophet puts it. He
[1:50:53] said, "Finally, one day they come to
[1:50:55] come by a royal seed, not born of a man,
[1:50:59] but conceived in the womb of a virgin by
[1:51:01] God himself with no sexual desire, Holy
[1:51:04] Spirit born." He said, "But when the
[1:51:06] Holy Ghost overshadowed that little
[1:51:08] virgin and conceived in there, the true
[1:51:10] seed of Abraham," how many, how many are
[1:51:13] the true seed of Abraham? Raise your
[1:51:15] hands, church, that's you.
[1:51:17] But when the true seed of Abraham, when
[1:51:20] that Holy Ghost had come in there and
[1:51:22] the true seed of Abraham, the faith that
[1:51:24] Abraham had in God, GOD HAD MADE A
[1:51:26] PROMISE to this seed born of virgin
[1:51:30] birth and that he had power over all the
[1:51:34] gates of the enemy.
[1:51:38] You want to talk about a Christmas
[1:51:40] message
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS COME DOWN ON THE SCENE AND
[1:51:43] WAS BORN IN THE AND birthed into the
[1:51:45] womb of this little virgin girl. And in
[1:51:48] that very womb, he has all of the power
[1:51:51] that he needs to overcome every gate of
[1:51:54] the enemy.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; And while he was HERE ON EARTH, HE HAD
[1:51:58] THE GATES OF SICKNESS in his power.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:05] You know, we give the devil a whole lot
[1:52:07] of credit, brother Ber. We give him a
[1:52:09] whole lot of credit that he really don't
[1:52:10] have coming.
[1:52:13] You say, "Well, I'm sick. The devil's
[1:52:15] really after me. I I got this. I got
[1:52:17] that. The devil's really got me." No,
[1:52:19] that's not the way the word reads. IT
[1:52:22] SAYS HE HAD THE POWER. HE HAD THE g the
[1:52:25] gates of sickness in his hands.
[1:52:32] He spoke to the sick and the gates were
[1:52:34] opened up.
[1:52:37] So why do we let de why do we let the
[1:52:39] devil bind us?
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; When the WORD SAYS HE SPOKE TO the sick
[1:52:43] and the gates OPENED UP AND THEY WALKED
[1:52:45] OUT FREE BECAUSE HE HAD THE GATES TO
[1:52:48] LEPROSY. Think about this in the Bible.
[1:52:51] When Jesus walked on the scene and there
[1:52:52] was lepers all around them and people
[1:52:55] were scared to go to him because they
[1:52:56] were afraid they were going to get the
[1:52:58] leprosy and he went and he just what did
[1:53:00] what? He unlocked the gate of leprosy
[1:53:03] and they became clean.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; When they were laying in the streets
[1:53:08] afflicted when they were laying in the
[1:53:09] streets years after years of being
[1:53:11] crippled and AFFLICTED WHEN JESUS WALKED
[1:53:14] BY HE JUST SIMPLY LOOKED down and said,
[1:53:16] "I'm going to unlock your gate to
[1:53:18] freedom."
[1:53:20] They got up AND WALKED.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; IT WAS JUST THAT SIMPLE. THAT'S WHAT HE
[1:53:25] DID. I'M GOING TO UNLOCK THE GATE. WHEN
[1:53:27] BLINDED EYES WERE THERE, HE UNLOCKED the
[1:53:29] gate of vision. Deaf ears, he unlocked
[1:53:32] the ears of hearing. And he owns that
[1:53:36] very key this morning. Brothers and
[1:53:37] sisters, if you could just let me tell
[1:53:39] you, IF YOU COULD JUST SWING those gates
[1:53:41] open, whatever your need is this
[1:53:45] morning, let Jesus take the key and
[1:53:47] unlock the GATE THAT IS HOLDING YOU
[1:53:49] BACK.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; If you were locked up this morning in a
[1:53:52] gate, in a prison house of depression,
[1:53:55] let Jesus take the key and open THE GATE
[1:53:58] AND FIND YOUR FREEDOM. YEAH, SIR.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; If you're in a prison this morning of
[1:54:07] doubt, maybe there's somebody sitting
[1:54:09] here say, "Man, I I don't know what this
[1:54:10] guy's talking about. I don't believe a
[1:54:12] word he's saying. I just can't believe
[1:54:14] it. I can't see it. I DON'T BELIEVE IT."
[1:54:16] UNLOCK. LET LET JESUS TAKE AND just put
[1:54:18] that key in that in that keyhole. Let
[1:54:20] him just take and put that key IN THERE
[1:54:22] AND JUST TURN THAT KEY AND LET'S SAY,
[1:54:24] GOD, OPEN UP MY HEART OF UNDERSTANDING
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; THAT I COULD SEE YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE,
[1:54:30] JESUS.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; John 3:16.
[1:54:39] Some of us live behind gates of fear.
[1:54:43] Some of us live behind gates of
[1:54:44] anxieties. Some of us are living behind
[1:54:47] gates of cancer,
[1:54:49] heart disease,
[1:54:51] diabetes,
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; fatigue,
[1:54:58] doubt.
[1:55:00] What trouble do you want to put in
[1:55:01] there? What's your trouble? Don't answer
[1:55:03] out loud.
[1:55:07] But many of us find ourselves living in
[1:55:10] a prison
[1:55:13] and we're bound up like a caged animal.
[1:55:20] And that's all you can think about
[1:55:24] is your hardship, your trial, your
[1:55:27] sickness,
[1:55:29] your fear,
[1:55:31] and you FIND YOURSELF LOCKED UP THERE.
[1:55:34] Sometimes people find themselves locked
[1:55:36] up behind a prison of lukewarmness.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Let's think about this, brothers and
[1:55:44] sisters. Now, this church as a whole has
[1:55:46] been on fire.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and praise the Lord.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; AS WE'VE HAD TESTIMONY AFTER testimony
[1:55:56] after testimony, and we we see the Lord
[1:55:58] moving in in our young people and moving
[1:56:00] more and more every time, this church as
[1:56:02] a whole has BEEN ON FIRE. BUT SOME OF US
[1:56:04] ARE STRUGGLING with lukewarmness.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE THE
[1:56:09] FIRE IN YOUR BONES.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; They're on PEOPLE GET ON FIRE, brother
[1:56:15] B, FOR SO MANY THINGS AROUND THE WORLD.
[1:56:17] THEY GET ON FIRE FOR THEIR JOBS.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; THEY GET ON FIRE for their kids
[1:56:21] activities.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; They Oh, man. I tell you, we can hoop
[1:56:25] and holler.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; WE GET ON FIRE for for our money.
[1:56:32] We get on fire for a favorite television
[1:56:34] program. Oh, glory.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; You get on fire for it. Can't wait till
[1:56:46] the next episode comes out. Man, I got
[1:56:49] to know what's going to happen.
[1:56:51] I think it's going to happen this way.
[1:56:52] No, no, no, man. We're going to wait. We
[1:56:54] just can't wait. We can't wait. Can't
[1:56:55] wait till that ball game comes on.
[1:57:01] I'm done talking about ball games. I got
[1:57:02] in trouble last time.
[1:57:05] I said, "We's going undefeated, going to
[1:57:07] win a championship." I think we're
[1:57:08] upside down in a in a whirlwind. Can't
[1:57:10] get out right now.
[1:57:16] But what has happened that has caused us
[1:57:19] to lose a fire? Now, I'm not asking you
[1:57:22] to raise your hand, but you know WHO YOU
[1:57:23] ARE.
[1:57:25] YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE SITTING HERE AND YOU
[1:57:26] THINK, "MY GOODNESS, I JUST DON'T HAVE
[1:57:28] THAT FIRE THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. I
[1:57:30] don't have that LOVE AND THAT JOY AND
[1:57:32] THAT EXCITEMENT WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THE
[1:57:33] WORD OF GOD. I DON'T CARE IF I GO TO
[1:57:35] CHURCH OR I DON'T go to church."
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Well, IF YOU DON'T CARE, THEN IT TELLS
[1:57:40] ME THAT YOU'RE NOT THAT that that you
[1:57:42] don't love the Lord the way you should.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Because the word says if the love of God
[1:57:46] is in your heart, YOU'LL BE IN THE HOUSE
[1:57:49] OF GOD EVERY TIME those doors are open.
[1:57:55] But lukewarmness, it become you become a
[1:57:57] prisoner of lukewarmness
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; and you will let everybody else do your
[1:58:03] work for you.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T ON FIRE,
[1:58:08] so you need everybody else to do the
[1:58:10] praying.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, would you pray for this? Would you
[1:58:20] pray for that? Please pray for the Well,
[1:58:22] sure I will. But what are you going to
[1:58:24] do when it's answered?
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; What What are you GOING TO DO WITH IT?
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Are you going to start coming to church
[1:58:35] every Sunday, every Wednesday? Are you
[1:58:38] going to start testifying when God
[1:58:40] answers your prayers? When God meets
[1:58:41] your needs, when God gives you what you
[1:58:43] have need of? and you've asked
[1:58:44] everybody, every deacon, every every
[1:58:46] trustee, every preacher in the world to
[1:58:48] pray that this happens. Are you going to
[1:58:50] give God the GLORY AND START SHOWING UP
[1:58:53] to serve, to praise, TO WORSHIP, TO
[1:58:56] TRUST IN GOD?
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of our praise.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Now, just because you don't get your
[1:59:05] prayer answered every time, that doesn't
[1:59:06] mean that you don't come to church.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; I serve him if he answers. I serve him
[1:59:11] if he don't.
[1:59:15] Why? Because what else am I going to
[1:59:16] serve?
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; People a lot of times will say, "Well, I
[1:59:21] don't ain't sure if you believe what I
[1:59:23] can believe exactly the way you
[1:59:25] believe." That's okay, BUT SHOW ME
[1:59:26] SOMETHING BETTER.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Show me SOMETHING THAT WILL CAUSE YOU TO
[1:59:31] LIVE THE WAY OUR PEOPLE LIVE.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Show me a word, a written word that will
[1:59:38] make you live better. Not that we're
[1:59:41] somebody. Not that we're better, not
[1:59:43] that we put ourselves, ESTEEM OURSELVES
[1:59:44] HIGHER, BUT IT'S THE WORD OF GOD. IT'S
[1:59:46] THE LIFE OF CHRIST LIVING FROM THE
[1:59:49] INSIDE, WORKING through the outside,
[1:59:51] making me act and do and talk the way I
[1:59:54] talk.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; That's the greatest gift.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; You want to know what the greatest GIFT
[2:00:01] IS? IT'S THE HOLY Ghost working in your
[2:00:02] life.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE HOLY GHOST MOVING IN YOUR
[2:00:05] CHILDREN. IT'S THE HOLY GHOST HEALING
[2:00:07] YOUR BODY. It's the Holy Ghost
[2:00:09] delivering you of the bondage that
[2:00:10] you're in.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; I know this ain't traditional. This
[2:00:15] ain't going down Jerusalem and
[2:00:17] Bethlehem,
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; but we're going down the living room.
[2:00:23] But Jesus has the keys that can open
[2:00:25] those gates.
[2:00:27] Now when we think about these gates,
[2:00:30] lukewarmness, doubt, hatred, envy,
[2:00:33] malice,
[2:00:35] sickness, disease, we think about those
[2:00:38] gates and we SAY, "HOW MANY WOULD AGREE
[2:00:40] JESUS has the key?"
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Well,
[2:00:44] we better rewind and start preaching
[2:00:46] again BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET HOW MANY
[2:00:48] BELIEVE JESUS HAS THE KEYS?
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; NOW, HERE'S WHERE WE HAVE TO BE BE
[2:00:54] RESPONSIBLE. If somebody comes in and
[2:00:56] says, "I've got a safe full of money and
[2:00:58] I've got a key and I'm gonna open the
[2:01:00] door."
[2:01:06] Hallelujah.
[2:01:11] Gold bars, silver bars,
[2:01:15] it's all yours. I got the key. I'm going
[2:01:17] to open the door. Are you going to sit
[2:01:18] on the outside of that safe, Michael
[2:01:20] John, and look in there and say, "Man,
[2:01:21] that sure is nice."
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:01:25] No, look at he's smiling like a monkey
[2:01:29] in a banana sideways. He knows what I'm
[2:01:32] talking about.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO JUMP IN THERE AND SAY,
[2:01:34] "THIS IS MINE." BECAUSE THE KING, THE
[2:01:36] MAN OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID, "I CAN
[2:01:38] HAVE IT ALL." BUT WE SAT THERE AND WE
[2:01:40] NOT WILLING TO WALK THROUGH THE DOOR.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO be willing as a believer to
[2:01:45] walk through the door AND SAY, "JESUS
[2:01:47] GAVE IT ALL. HE UNLOCKED IT. HE UNLOCKED
[2:01:50] ALL THE se gates to sickness, to
[2:01:52] depression, TO ANXIETY. WE'VE GOT TO BE
[2:01:55] WILLING TO WALK through the gates and
[2:01:57] take it and say it's mine and possess
[2:01:59] it.
[2:02:01] You know, when Daniel, the seed of
[2:02:03] Abraham was thrown into the lion's den.
[2:02:06] You think about Daniel down in that
[2:02:08] lion's den. He goes into the lion's den
[2:02:09] to be killed by these lions and the
[2:02:12] angel of the Lord comes up to him that
[2:02:14] night and stopped those lions.
[2:02:19] No doubt that great pillar of fire come
[2:02:21] down. The same pillar of fire that was
[2:02:24] with the children of Israel through the
[2:02:25] wilderness, THAT SAME PILLAR OF FIRE
[2:02:27] COME DOWN. And he SAID, "YOU KNOW,
[2:02:29] ANIMALS DON'T LIKE don't like fire. They
[2:02:31] don't like light." But that PILLAR OF
[2:02:33] FIRE COME down there and IT BEGAN TO SET
[2:02:35] over into the corner
[2:02:37] right there where that lion was. And
[2:02:39] there was Daniel and a face off face to
[2:02:43] face with this lion. And the pillar of
[2:02:45] fire comes moving in. THE PILLAR OF FIRE
[2:02:49] comes moving in. And there was Daniel
[2:02:51] right there. And the prophet said that
[2:02:53] that animal was so scared of the light,
[2:02:54] that big light lion set over there. And
[2:02:56] he said it laid down in that corner.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Now that's somebody that's got a key to
[2:03:03] a gate.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; What was it? You say, "Well, God moved
[2:03:10] on the scene." WHAT WAS IT? I SAID,
[2:03:12] "DANIEL,
[2:03:14] listen to me. Daniel possessed the gate
[2:03:17] of that enemy."
[2:03:21] Daniel possessed the gate OF THAT ENEMY.
[2:03:24] DANIEL, HE SAYS, CLOSED THE MOUTH of the
[2:03:26] lion because God had promised that he
[2:03:28] was Abraham's seed and HE JUST ACCEPTED
[2:03:30] WHAT GOD SAID HE WAS ABLE to do for him.
[2:03:39] Is God able to give you your children
[2:03:41] back?
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we've seen witness of that. Is God
[2:03:46] able to heal of your diseases? Yes,
[2:03:48] we've seen witness of that. IS GOD ABLE
[2:03:51] TO DELIVER YOU AND GET make you free in
[2:03:53] YOUR LIFE? YES, WE HAVE seen
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; those three Hebrew children. They come
[2:04:01] into a place that they were thrown into
[2:04:03] a fiery furnace.
[2:04:05] WHAT WAS THAT INSIDE THAT FIERY FURNACE?
[2:04:08] THEY HAD POSSESSED THE KEY. THEY HAD
[2:04:11] POSSESSED THE GATES OF THAT FURNACE. The
[2:04:14] son of God had came down there and took
[2:04:17] the fire off of them.
[2:04:20] Now, could they do that? No. But they
[2:04:23] had the key.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; THEY KNEW WHAT GOD WAS ABLE TO DO.
[2:04:28] THEREFORE, they did not fear. They did
[2:04:30] not worry. THEY DIDN'T HAVE DOUBT. THEY
[2:04:32] SAID, "WE'RE GOING TO WALK INTO THIS
[2:04:33] FIRE. WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO THIS
[2:04:34] FURNACE AND GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF IT
[2:04:36] BECAUSE he said he would do it.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Moses when he come in there, Moses
[2:04:42] coming there on the commission from God
[2:04:44] down to Egypt to bring those children
[2:04:45] out of the out of Egypt and into the
[2:04:47] promised land. The prophet said the
[2:04:49] devil draw a gate across him.
[2:04:56] They walk up to that Red Sea. Brother
[2:04:57] Eduardo, they walk up to that RED SEA.
[2:05:00] THE PROPHET SAID HE DREW A GATE RIGHT
[2:05:02] THERE WITH THE Red Sea in front of him
[2:05:04] and the old Pharaoh coming up from
[2:05:06] behind him. Nowhere to go. Couldn't go
[2:05:09] forward. Can't go backwards. But there
[2:05:11] was a gate right there. And there was a
[2:05:13] key right there surrounded by Pharaoh's
[2:05:15] army.
[2:05:17] And the key be to turn.
[2:05:26] He said the wind be to blow. The wind be
[2:05:30] to blow. They drove a It blowed so much
[2:05:32] that it blowed a dry streak right across
[2:05:35] that Red Sea.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; A key.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; A KEY THAT GOD'S people had possession
[2:05:42] of. You see, it was a key THAT THEY HAD
[2:05:44] POSSESSION OF. THEY COME INTO THE
[2:05:46] wilderness and the and the and the
[2:05:47] Jordan there. GOD SPOKE TO JOSHUA AND HE
[2:05:50] TOLD JOSHUA, he said, "Now I'm going to
[2:05:52] let you I want you to cross over that
[2:05:54] Jordan River.
[2:05:59] Make my people ready.
[2:06:03] Make my people ready in the month of
[2:06:05] April.
[2:06:07] Make them ready on the month that I'm
[2:06:08] going to flood this place."
[2:06:12] Remember, he don't think our thoughts.
[2:06:14] We don't think his thoughts.
[2:06:16] He's going to flood the place, but he's
[2:06:19] telling Joshua to make my people ready.
[2:06:22] Make my people ready as I get ready to
[2:06:23] flood this place. And I'm going to
[2:06:25] SPREAD THE WATER ALL ACROSS the valleys
[2:06:27] in this in this land right here. Now,
[2:06:30] this looked like a poor poor poor
[2:06:33] strategy.
[2:06:35] But, you know, sometimes we shouldn't be
[2:06:37] thinking about what God's plan is about
[2:06:39] our plan, but think about what God's
[2:06:40] plan is. GOD WAS PLANNING TO DO
[2:06:43] SOMETHING ON THE MIRACULOUS SIDE. WHEN
[2:06:45] IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS NO WAY POSSIBLE
[2:06:47] WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE THEY COULDN'T CROSS.
[2:06:49] When it looked like that that THE
[2:06:50] STRATEGY WAS SO BAD THAT THAT MUDDY
[2:06:52] JORDAN RIVER, THE WORST TIME IN the
[2:06:55] world and the in the day right there,
[2:06:57] the river at its highest. But brothers
[2:07:00] and sisters, MANY TIMES GOD LETS US end
[2:07:02] up down that same road.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; God will allow us to go down that same
[2:07:08] road when all seems hopeless.
[2:07:11] Think about this. Think about the Daniel
[2:07:13] in the lion's den.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Think about the three Hebrew children in
[2:07:18] the fiery furnace. Think about uh the
[2:07:21] Moses here as he comes up to the Red
[2:07:22] Sea. Think about ju Joseph now or Joshua
[2:07:25] now as he's coming up to the sea and has
[2:07:28] to cross over THE JORDAN RIVER. GOD MANY
[2:07:30] TIMES WHEN IT SEEMS hopeless when all we
[2:07:33] know to do is to give up.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN ALL WE KNOW TO DO IS JUST CALL
[2:07:38] SURRENDER.
[2:07:40] I can't take it no more, devil.
[2:07:43] I can't take it no more. I'm at I'm at
[2:07:45] my wits ends. I'm at a roadblock and I
[2:07:47] can't get through it. I can't get around
[2:07:49] it. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER. THAT'S WHEN
[2:07:51] YOU CALL ON GOD.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER, HE'S GOT
[2:07:56] THE ANSWER. WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A WAY,
[2:07:59] HE MAKES A WAY.
[2:08:02] THAT'S OUR GOD. THAT'S THE key to the
[2:08:04] kingdom this morning.
[2:08:08] If you're a SEED OF ABRAHAM,
[2:08:10] GOD IS GOING TO HOLD on to his promise.
[2:08:13] IF YOU'RE A SEED OF ABRAHAM, GOD CAN
[2:08:15] GIVE YOU HEALING. GOD CAN GIVE YOU
[2:08:17] SALVATION. GOD CAN GIVE YOU YOUR
[2:08:20] CHILDREN. GOD CAN GIVE YOU YOUR JOY. I
[2:08:22] SAID GOD CAN GIVE YOU THE FIRE IN YOUR
[2:08:24] BONES LIKE YOU'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE.
[2:08:32] But sometimes it's at the end of the
[2:08:33] road.
[2:08:35] Sometimes it's at the end of the road
[2:08:37] and it looks worse than it ever did.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; The doctor says there's not a chance.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; He don't know my God.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; You know, the devil is so dumb.
[2:09:05] just an absolute idiot to think that he
[2:09:09] can have dominion over anything my God
[2:09:12] says I can have.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Think about this. If if somebody come to
[2:09:18] me AND SAID, "LISTEN, BRAD, I'M GOING TO
[2:09:20] GIVE YOU I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THIS
[2:09:21] PARTIAL of land and it goes from this
[2:09:24] corner to that corner to that corner to
[2:09:26] that corner.
[2:09:28] Do you think I'm going to let anybody
[2:09:30] else tell me what to do on that land?"
[2:09:33] Come on, church. Am I going to let
[2:09:35] anybody else come in there and walk in
[2:09:36] there and say, "Well, I think I'm going
[2:09:37] to cut a road right through here to get
[2:09:39] to MY PROPERTY." OH, NO YOU DON'T.
[2:09:41] BECAUSE I am the king of this kingdom.
[2:09:43] THIS IS MY DOMAIN. AND GOD SAYS, "IF I
[2:09:46] CAN HAVE IT, he can give it."
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; He's more than able.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Joshua didn't begin to think about how
[2:09:58] wide the Jordan River was.
[2:10:02] He didn't walk up there and say, "Man,
[2:10:03] this sure is muddy.
[2:10:07] I'm just going to get stuck in this bog.
[2:10:10] We need to get us some kind of shoes or
[2:10:12] something. Some kind of snowshoes or we
[2:10:14] got to put lay we got to lay us some
[2:10:16] boards out across here because this this
[2:10:18] has just become so muddy that if we
[2:10:20] don't do that, THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID.
[2:10:22] HE SAID, "GATHER YOURSELVES."
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; He looked down there at THAT WATER AND
[2:10:26] HE SAID, "WELL, PRAISE THE LORD. GET
[2:10:28] READY, BOYS. GATHER YOURSELVES.
[2:10:31] WE'RE GOING ACROSS.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING ACROSS THIS RIVER BECAUSE I
[2:10:35] KNOW A MAN THAT'S GOT THE KEY. SO,
[2:10:38] SANCTIFY YOURSELVES.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; That's a lot of times that's a problem.
[2:10:45] We're ready to gather ourselves. We
[2:10:46] ready to go. We ready to do. But we fail
[2:10:48] to sanctify ourselves.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to
[2:10:55] help you.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; We got We can't get the cart in front of
[2:10:58] the horse. We got to keep things in
[2:11:00] order.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; SANCTIFY OURSELVES, GATHER OURSELVES,
[2:11:03] GET READY TO CROSS WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN
[2:11:04] US. BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT IN AN
[2:11:06] UNCLEAN, unfilthy way.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; But sanctify YOURSELVES AND FIND
[2:11:11] YOURSELVES. GATHER YOURSELVES. GET READY
[2:11:13] TO CROSS OVER THAT JORDAN RIVER BECAUSE
[2:11:15] GOD HAS A key to the kingdom.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, we're living in an
[2:11:22] hour of possession.
[2:11:26] You hear the testimonies. WHY IS THAT?
[2:11:28] BECAUSE THIS IS AN HOUR of possession.
[2:11:32] It's an hour WHERE GOD HAS CALLED OUT TO
[2:11:34] HIS CHILDREN. WHEN GOD HAS CALLED OUT TO
[2:11:36] THE BELIEVERS, THE BRIDE JESUS CHRIST TO
[2:11:38] SAY, "LISTEN, THIS IS WHAT I MADE YOU to
[2:11:41] be."
[2:11:44] And you know what? Some of her is
[2:11:46] accepting it.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Some of her is grasping A HOLD OF WHAT'S
[2:11:50] BEING SAID. SOME OF THEM are believing
[2:11:53] that WHEN HE SAYS YOU CAN BY HIS STRIPES
[2:11:56] OR BY MY STRIPES YOU CAN BE HEALED.
[2:11:59] There's a group OF PEOPLE THAT'S TAKEN A
[2:12:01] HOLD OF IT AND SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I
[2:12:03] JUST HAD A REAL fresh revelation that
[2:12:05] the word of God tells me no matter what
[2:12:07] I'm going through, no matter what my
[2:12:08] sickness, no matter WHAT IT IS, THAT BY
[2:12:11] HIS STRIPES, the promise says I can at
[2:12:16] his will be free.
[2:12:24] Somebody ought to praise the Lord this
[2:12:25] morning.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY OUGHT TO SHOUT AMEN THIS
[2:12:29] MORNING.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say hallelujah this
[2:12:32] morning
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF WHAT GOD IS DOING IN THIS
[2:12:34] HOUR. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, it's an hour
[2:12:36] of possession. I just want you to have
[2:12:39] what he wants you to have.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; They smacked him on the face.
[2:12:50] They pulled the the hairs of his beard
[2:12:53] out of his face. They spit up on him.
[2:12:56] THEY THEY TRIED TO get him to do
[2:12:58] something that was wrong. They tried to
[2:12:59] get him to GIVE UP. THEY TRIED TO GET
[2:13:01] HIM TO QUIT. And Jesus said, listen to
[2:13:03] this. Jesus said, "I could speak to my
[2:13:05] father." And straightway he would send
[2:13:07] me 12 legions of angels.
[2:13:12] Now you think about how much God loves
[2:13:14] you.
[2:13:19] Satan tried to give him an out.
[2:13:22] All you got to do is just renounce what
[2:13:24] this whole mission that you come down
[2:13:25] from heaven. All you got to do is
[2:13:27] renounce all of that. I'll give you all
[2:13:29] this kingdom. Look out here, Jesus. You
[2:13:30] can have all of this and you never have
[2:13:33] to go to Calvary.
[2:13:37] And Jesus in reply,
[2:13:39] listen, I could call 12 legions
[2:13:43] of angels
[2:13:45] and my father would send them
[2:13:49] for me.
[2:13:50] But you know, the whole point of the
[2:13:52] story is he wasn't thinking about
[2:13:54] himself. THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; I MY FATHER COULD SEND 12 LEGIONS of
[2:13:59] angels for Elton, Kentucky.
[2:14:03] MY FATHER COULD SEND 12 LEGIONS of
[2:14:05] angels for the little assembly over here
[2:14:07] for Lacy, for Tammy,
[2:14:11] for Lisa, for Joe.
[2:14:15] Now, let's put this in perspective here.
[2:14:17] What this says, IT SAYS THAT JESUS HAS
[2:14:19] full authority and power. And it shows
[2:14:22] that he could easily overcome his
[2:14:24] capttors.
[2:14:27] He could call him down and say, "I I can
[2:14:29] send these angels to whoop every single
[2:14:31] one of you." But no, he chose. I SAID HE
[2:14:35] CHOSE TO GO GET THE KEYS.
[2:14:38] HE MADE A CHOICE TO GO GET THE KEYS to
[2:14:40] the kingdom from the pits of hell
[2:14:43] instead of calling a legion of angels.
[2:14:48] Let's put in perspective what this
[2:14:49] legion is. You know, a legion, we've
[2:14:51] talked about this, a Roman legion of
[2:14:52] 6,000 soldiers.
[2:14:55] SO HE COULD HAVE CALLED 12 LEGIONS.
[2:14:57] 72,000
[2:14:59] angels at his beck and call. 72,000
[2:15:04] angels at his beck and call. And Jesus
[2:15:07] emphasizes,
[2:15:09] I've got a limitless amount of angels.
[2:15:12] More than 12 legions could come at my
[2:15:15] beck and call.
[2:15:19] Let's talk about the power of these
[2:15:20] angels.
[2:15:24] There's a story in Isaiah chapter 37.
[2:15:27] I'll read it real quick. Third verse 36.
[2:15:30] Then the angel of the Lord went forth
[2:15:31] and smoked in the camp of the Assyrians
[2:15:33] 104 score and 5,000. When they arose in
[2:15:36] the morning, behold, they were all dead
[2:15:38] corpses.
[2:15:44] Let me tell you how many that was. One
[2:15:45] angel defeated 185,000 Assyrian
[2:15:48] soldiers.
[2:15:54] one.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about 12 legions.
[2:15:58] We're talking about 72,000.
[2:16:00] Let me tell you that. I I'll just do the
[2:16:02] math for you. Don't get your calculators
[2:16:03] out. They they'll think you're texting
[2:16:05] in church, okay?
[2:16:09] 3,318
[2:16:10] million
[2:16:15] enemies
[2:16:16] fallen at the 12 legions that he could
[2:16:19] have called.
[2:16:21] And we talk we and we think we got
[2:16:23] troubles. Listen to me. Let me tell you,
[2:16:25] THERE AIN'T ENOUGH DEVILS OUT OF HELL
[2:16:27] AND WHOOP THAT. THREE BILLION ENEMIES
[2:16:31] WILL FALL AT THE FEET OF THE 12 LEGION
[2:16:33] ANGELS. ALL WE NEED TO do is TO BE ABLE
[2:16:35] TO CALL ON GOD AND SAY, "GOD, SEND YOUR
[2:16:37] MINISTERING angels down TO US AND HELP
[2:16:40] ME WIN this battle.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; The battle's not mine. It's his." Said
[2:16:45] little David.
[2:16:50] Let me tell you, Joshua,
[2:16:58] Jesus,
[2:16:59] let's think about this. I got to slow
[2:17:01] down. I'm gonna finish before I need to
[2:17:06] Joshua. Now,
[2:17:09] Daniel, David, Moses, Joseph,
[2:17:15] all of them had power to conquer an
[2:17:19] enemy.
[2:17:23] But now, G Oh, I'm glad it got quiet.
[2:17:24] Listen to what I'm about to say. But
[2:17:26] Jesus, he came because Jesus had to
[2:17:30] conquer the one that they could not
[2:17:33] conquer.
[2:17:41] There's one shouting account. I SAID
[2:17:43] JESUS CAME TO CONQUER WHAT THEY COULDN'T
[2:17:46] CONQUER. THEY HAD THEIR BATTLES. YES,
[2:17:49] THEY WON THEIR BATTLES. BUT JESUS DON'T
[2:17:51] JUST WIN THE BATTLE, BROTHERS AND
[2:17:52] SISTERS. HE WINS THE WAR. We win.
[2:18:00] THEY KILLED HIM ON CALVARY. THERE HE
[2:18:03] WAS. THEY KILLED HIM ON CALVARY AND HIS
[2:18:04] SOUL DESCENDS DOWN INTO HELL. AND HE
[2:18:06] GOES DOWN THERE AND HE TURNS THE KEY ON
[2:18:08] HELL and says, "Listen," he comes down
[2:18:10] there and he unlocks this place. And the
[2:18:12] prophet said he absolutely took it over.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; SATAN COULD NOT STAND IT. HE KNOCKS ON
[2:18:23] THE DOOR. LET ME IN. I'M HERE TO TAKE
[2:18:26] OVER. GIVE ME THOSE KEYS.
[2:18:32] WHAT WERE THOSE KEYS? THOSE KEYS WERE
[2:18:35] THE KEYS TO YOUR GATE AND YOUR GATE AND
[2:18:37] YOUR GATE AND YOUR GATE AND YOUR GATE.
[2:18:40] THAT'S WHOSE KEYS HE TOOK AND SAYS, "I'M
[2:18:43] ABOUT TO FREE ALL OF MY CHILDREN."
[2:18:53] And when we are dead in Christ as
[2:18:56] Abraham's seed, we're more than
[2:18:59] conquerors.
[2:19:00] I said, "We're more than conquerors
[2:19:02] through him who conquered everything for
[2:19:04] us."
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; No reason. No reason for us to have to
[2:19:09] overcome anything.
[2:19:13] What y'all get so quiet for? He said,
[2:19:15] "It's no reason for us to have to
[2:19:17] overcome anything because it's already
[2:19:19] conquered.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; It's already conquered. He's already
[2:19:22] went. The last enemy, the last sickness,
[2:19:24] the last death, the temptation, all
[2:19:26] those things are put under his feet on
[2:19:30] Calvary.
[2:19:37] And we are the seed of Abraham. And he
[2:19:40] said, being dead in Christ, WE ARE
[2:19:42] ABRAHAM'S SEED, MARCHING on to victory,
[2:19:45] to victory,
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; to victory. WE DON'T STOP AT ONE. I'm
[2:19:50] here to win everything that God has
[2:19:52] promised me. I'M NOT PLANNING ON GIVING
[2:19:54] THE DEVIL ONE THING OF MINE BECAUSE THIS
[2:19:57] IS MY DOMAIN. THIS WORLD THAT GOD HAS
[2:20:00] GIVEN ME. It's where I dwell
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; and it's where THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[2:20:05] dwells
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; right here.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Stay away Satan. This property is
[2:20:11] posted.
[2:20:15] Death has no gate for us. Brothers and
[2:20:18] sisters, I'll never die.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; How many is in Christ this morning?
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NEVER DIE.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; I will NEVER DIE BECAUSE I'M ALREADY
[2:20:35] DEAD.
[2:20:36] MY LIFE, I'm buried. My life is hid in
[2:20:39] God through Christ.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Now, do I sometimes get myself in the
[2:20:43] way? Do I get my life in the way? Yes,
[2:20:45] sir. Oh yeah.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; But when I think about it, I thank God,
[2:20:49] LET ME START OVER this morning.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Now I lay me down to sleep. Forgive me
[2:20:54] for the mistakes I make.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; And when my feet hit the floor, Lord,
[2:20:58] give me a new start
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; every morning. But our life is hid in
[2:21:05] Christ, sealed by the Holy Ghost. And
[2:21:07] the Bible says, "The devil couldn't get
[2:21:09] me if he had to.
[2:21:12] IF HE HAD TO, IF THE DE SO SOUL, IF THE
[2:21:15] DEVIL'S HELL DEMANDED AND RELIED UPON
[2:21:18] getting you, HE CANNOT GET you
[2:21:22] off limits.
[2:21:27] I want you to notice the power in the
[2:21:30] name of Jesus this morning. Luke chapter
[2:21:33] 1, I'm going to read a little bit to you
[2:21:35] here. Luke chapter 1. And the angel came
[2:21:37] unto her and said, "Hail, thou art
[2:21:39] highly favored. The Lord is with thee.
[2:21:41] Blessed art thou among the women. This
[2:21:43] is Luke chapter 1. If you brothers want
[2:21:45] to pull it up. And when she saw him, she
[2:21:47] was troubled at his saying, said, cast
[2:21:49] in her mind, what manner of salutation
[2:21:51] should this be? The angel said unto her,
[2:21:54] Fear not, Mary, for thou has found favor
[2:21:57] with God. Isn't that a good place to be?
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Fear not, bride, you have found favor
[2:22:03] with God.
[2:22:07] Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,
[2:22:10] and bring forth a son, and his name
[2:22:12] shall be called Jesus. And then Mary
[2:22:16] said unto the angel, How shall this be,
[2:22:18] seeing that I know not a man? And the
[2:22:20] angel said unto her, the Holy Ghost
[2:22:22] shall come upon thee, and the power of
[2:22:23] the highest shall overshadow thee.
[2:22:25] Therefore also that holy thing which
[2:22:28] shall be born of thee shall be called
[2:22:30] the Son of God.
[2:22:32] Skip down to verse 36 there. And behold
[2:22:36] thy cousin Elizabeth.
[2:22:40] We ever read this in a Christmas
[2:22:41] message? Not usually. Behold thy cousin
[2:22:45] Elizabeth. She also hath conceived a son
[2:22:48] in her old age and is about the sixth
[2:22:49] month with her who is called barren.
[2:22:53] And this is an astounding statement. The
[2:22:55] next verse 37. Put that up there,
[2:22:57] brothers.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:05] Your cousin Elizabeth is going to
[2:23:06] conceive a child. She's six months
[2:23:08] conceived and but and she's called
[2:23:11] barren. But for WITH GOD NOTHING SHALL
[2:23:13] BE IMPOSSIBLE. And she rose in the city
[2:23:16] and and left haste and left into the
[2:23:18] city of Judah and entered into
[2:23:20] Zachariah's
[2:23:21] house and saluted Elizabeth. And it came
[2:23:24] to pass when Elizabeth heard the
[2:23:26] salutations of Mary, the babe leapt
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled
[2:23:33] with the Holy Ghost.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:23:43] Mary Mary was kind of working for UPS at
[2:23:45] that time. She's delivering Christmas
[2:23:48] packages.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Hey, Elizabeth.
[2:23:52] You know, Prophet says she was going
[2:23:53] down through there. She was going there
[2:23:55] and and the and the and the angel the
[2:23:56] Gabriel had told her exactly what was
[2:23:58] going to happen and and that she would
[2:23:59] call his name Jesus. and and and and
[2:24:01] you're going to go see your your your
[2:24:03] cousin Elizabeth and everything's going
[2:24:05] to all this stuff is going to transpire.
[2:24:07] Now, Elizabeth had been praying to God.
[2:24:10] Elizabeth had been praying to God that
[2:24:12] God would give them a baby. She was
[2:24:15] barren, 60 years old, and and Zechar
[2:24:18] Zacharias was Zachchariah was in his
[2:24:20] 70s, no children,
[2:24:24] and she'd been praying.
[2:24:27] Now, Zachariah goes up into the church
[2:24:29] to carry out his mintorial duties. And
[2:24:32] while he's up there, HE GOES OVER AND HE
[2:24:34] LOOKS AND he sees the angel Gabriel
[2:24:36] standing in the corner. And Gabriel then
[2:24:38] confirms to him, "Hey, listen to me.
[2:24:41] You're going to have a child."
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:24:47] I want you to listen to what he says
[2:24:48] here. While he was in there burning
[2:24:50] incense, he stood there standing at the
[2:24:52] right hand of the altar. There stood
[2:24:53] Gabriel, the archangel.
[2:24:55] Now his next statement says, "Live
[2:24:57] right, do right. Angels are still
[2:25:00] living. God has them at his command."
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; There stood a Gabriel the archangel and
[2:25:06] told him what was going to happen. And
[2:25:07] after this, he goes down there and now
[2:25:09] Elizabeth, as soon as she found out that
[2:25:11] she was going to be mother.
[2:25:14] So he goes home and he tells Elizabeth,
[2:25:16] "Now listen to what happened at the
[2:25:17] church.
[2:25:20] When I was up there doing MY DUTIES, I
[2:25:21] SAW AN ANGEL, GABRIEL, AND he says,
[2:25:23] "We're going to have a child."
[2:25:26] And the prophet said she she doubted.
[2:25:28] No, no, don't get the story mixed up.
[2:25:32] She didn't doubt. He said SHE WENT AND
[2:25:34] HID HERSELF AWAY. And she began to knit
[2:25:36] little booties.
[2:25:39] And she went in there and she began to
[2:25:41] knit these little booties getting ready
[2:25:42] for this little fella. She began to knit
[2:25:44] a little blanket and getting all these
[2:25:46] things together because she knew she was
[2:25:48] going to be a mother. But she began to
[2:25:50] worry about something.
[2:25:53] How many of you's ever had a promise
[2:25:55] from God and and it's all good and it
[2:25:57] sounds good and you know it's going to
[2:25:58] happen, but all of a sudden it's not
[2:26:00] lining up
[2:26:03] and you begin to worry. You know it was
[2:26:07] God that told you. YOU KNOW IT WAS GOD
[2:26:09] THAT YOU HAD YOUR FAITH IN. BUT NOW ALL
[2:26:11] OF A SUDDEN THINGS are not lining up and
[2:26:13] this is not going as you planned in your
[2:26:15] mind. Remember he don't think our
[2:26:17] thoughts. We don't think his thoughts.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; Keep ourselves out of the way.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; But here it was Elizabeth now. SHE DONE
[2:26:25] GETTING EVERYTHING READY. BUT SHE BEGAN
[2:26:27] TO WORRY because it was about six months
[2:26:29] and that baby had not yet moved.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Six months. Any of you mothers or
[2:26:37] expected mothers know that that's not
[2:26:38] normal.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Six months. There should be some moving.
[2:26:42] There should be some thrashing. There
[2:26:43] should be some life in there.
[2:26:47] So now she's sitting there and and and
[2:26:49] she pulls back her curtain and sees this
[2:26:51] sees this little girl running, this
[2:26:53] little 18year-old girl running towards
[2:26:55] her house. And she's looking trying to
[2:26:58] figure out who is this? I should know
[2:27:00] her. Well, look well, look at here's
[2:27:02] Look at THAT. THIS IS THAT'S MARY. LOOK
[2:27:05] AT HER. I know who this is. Mary, come
[2:27:06] on IN HERE. COME ON IN, MARY. WHAT HAVE
[2:27:08] YOU got to tell what's going on? How are
[2:27:10] you doing? Oh, I'm just fine. How are
[2:27:13] you, Elizabeth? I'm fine. I'm feeling
[2:27:15] wonderful.
[2:27:17] And Mary says, "I'm so happy to hear the
[2:27:19] news that you're going to have a child."
[2:27:25] Do you ever wonder how Elizabeth thought
[2:27:26] that Mary knew that?
[2:27:30] Well, the Gabriel, the archangel, told
[2:27:33] Mary, "Go see Elizabeth. She's going to
[2:27:35] have a child."
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; That's who the messenger was.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; And I'm so happy to hear that you're
[2:27:41] going to have a child. And she said,
[2:27:43] "That's right. I'm so happy. I am so
[2:27:46] happy. And and she said, "Mary, or she
[2:27:49] said she said," Elizabeth, do you know
[2:27:52] that I'm going to have a child, too?
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; Well, you and Joseph got married.
[2:27:58] Congratulations. Well, not exactly.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; Not exactly.
[2:28:07] I'm not married at all, but I am going
[2:28:10] to be a mother.
[2:28:12] I don't understand this Mary. I don't
[2:28:15] understand WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU
[2:28:16] TRYING TO TELL ME? WELL, YOU SEE THE an
[2:28:19] angel named Gabriel come down and told
[2:28:21] me
[2:28:24] that I was GOING TO BE OVERSHADOWED WITH
[2:28:25] A CHILD OF THE HOLY GHOST. And he said
[2:28:28] THAT YOU WHO WAS ONCE BARREN THROUGH GOD
[2:28:31] WHERE ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE are now
[2:28:33] going to have a child.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; So don't worry.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; God's got it all under control.
[2:28:43] You mean you mean Mary? You mean Gabriel
[2:28:46] come and told YOU THAT? YES. GABRIEL
[2:28:48] COME AND TOLD ME THAT AND HE ALSO TOLD
[2:28:50] ME THAT I'M GOING TO CALL HIS NAME
[2:28:51] JESUS. AND THAT BABY JUMPED. THAT BABY
[2:28:54] LEAPT FOR JOY. A BABY THAT WAS ONCE DEAD
[2:28:57] IN THE WOMB OF ITS MOTHER AT THE NAME of
[2:29:00] Jesus begins to roll. It begins to
[2:29:02] thrash. IT BEGINS TO PRAISE the Lord for
[2:29:04] what God is doing in its life.
[2:29:09] As soon as she said Jesus, that little
[2:29:11] John come to life.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the the enlightenment on
[2:29:19] Elizabeth's face?
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW SHE MUST HAVE FELT
[2:29:23] WHEN AND WHEN THAT NAME JESUS was
[2:29:25] spoken? The name of Jesus Christ that
[2:29:27] brought the life into that dead baby.
[2:29:29] The first time his name, brothers and
[2:29:31] sisters, was ever spoken through human
[2:29:33] lips and a dead baby comes to life.
[2:29:46] Not only that, but the Bible says that
[2:29:48] that baby in the womb of Elizabeth's
[2:29:50] womb would be full of the Holy Ghost.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, what a gift. Full of the Holy
[2:29:59] Ghost. SO IT THAT SAME name Jesus if it
[2:30:03] would heal and deliver a dead baby in
[2:30:07] the womb that's the same name WHEN WE
[2:30:10] SAY JESUS I'm sick
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; and that's THE SAME NAME JESUS I'M SICK
[2:30:15] AND IT GIVES HEALING IT'S THE SAME NAME
[2:30:17] WHEN WE SAY JESUS I'M OPPRESSED AND HE
[2:30:20] frees the oppressed IT'S THE SAME NAME
[2:30:22] that when you're under bondage
[2:30:25] when you need deliverance in your life
[2:30:28] WHEN YOU'VE GOT HABITS THAT YOU CAN'T
[2:30:29] OVERCOME. It's the same name. WHEN YOU
[2:30:32] SAY JESUS, HE moves on the scene. And
[2:30:35] you ought to come to life when you hear
[2:30:37] that name, Jesus. You ought to stand to
[2:30:39] your feet and praise God for what he's
[2:30:41] done in your life.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; HE'S WORTHY OF OUR PRAISE. HE'S WORTHY
[2:30:49] OF ALL GRACE. HE'S WORTHY OF ALL
[2:30:51] DOMINION. HE'S WORTHY OF HONOR. HE'S
[2:30:54] WORTHY of glory.
[2:30:56] Why? Because it's Jesus. It's Jesus.
[2:31:00] It's Jesus.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the Lord said unim,
[2:31:18] I'm going to give you a sign. The virgin
[2:31:21] shall conceive.
[2:31:24] Now the name Emanuel would become a a
[2:31:26] promise.
[2:31:28] It would become a promise. It becomes a
[2:31:30] promise that Jesus is going to establish
[2:31:32] himself as an everpresent help in a time
[2:31:36] of trouble.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; What a gift.
[2:31:45] What was it?
[2:31:47] It was Christ reconciling himself to the
[2:31:50] world.
[2:31:54] Brother Ber mentioned it. He probably
[2:31:57] didn't know why he was mentioning it,
[2:31:58] but it was in my notes.
[2:32:01] Either that or he was at my in my house
[2:32:03] this morning looking over my shoulder.
[2:32:07] But Jesus became a man
[2:32:11] to overcome everything that we couldn't.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; Think about this.
[2:32:19] Down on his road DOWN THERE TO MEET
[2:32:20] LAZARUS. LAZARUS LAYING DOWN THERE DEAD
[2:32:22] IN A TOMB. And he was looked like that
[2:32:25] that the human being part had been
[2:32:26] conquered. And there was his flesh, the
[2:32:29] human the flesh,
[2:32:34] God, the man
[2:32:36] walking down there. And he begins to
[2:32:38] weep
[2:32:39] and he begins to cry and he begins to
[2:32:42] hurt because OF WHAT HE KNOWS HAS
[2:32:44] happened to Lazarus.
[2:32:46] This was his friend. and he's looking
[2:32:48] down there and he looks down THERE AND
[2:32:50] HE'S CRYING AND WEEPING.
[2:32:53] But then he throws his shoulders back.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; The tears dry up.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; The crying stops.
[2:33:05] The weeping. The emotions are put aside.
[2:33:08] And he says, "Lazareth,
[2:33:12] LAZARUS, COME FORTH." BROTHERS AND
[2:33:14] SISTERS, THAT WAS MORE THAN A MAN. THAT
[2:33:16] WAS GOD ON THE SCENE. THAT WAS GOD
[2:33:19] DELIVERING HIS WORD. THAT WAS GOD
[2:33:21] DELIVERING A MESSAGE for that hour. When
[2:33:25] he come down out of the mountains and he
[2:33:27] come down that night and he was hungry.
[2:33:28] He didn't have nothing to eat. And there
[2:33:30] was a fig tree with no figs on it. And
[2:33:32] he looks down there and he's hungry.
[2:33:34] He's hungrying as a man and says, "Man,
[2:33:36] I got to have something to eat."
[2:33:40] That was a man.
[2:33:42] But when HE TOOK THOSE FIVE FISHES AND
[2:33:44] those loaves and those fishes and he
[2:33:47] began to break it and he BEGAN TO TAKE
[2:33:48] THOSE FIVE BISCUITS and those two fishes
[2:33:50] and HE BEGINS TO FEED 5,000 MEN, 5,000
[2:33:54] WOMEN AND their children, that was more
[2:33:57] than a man.
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; That was not him hungering as a man, BUT
[2:34:01] THAT WAS GOD IN THE MAN.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:34:09] Prophet said one day he was laying on
[2:34:10] that boat that night and the storm was
[2:34:13] so bad and so torturous. He was just
[2:34:15] worn plum out from preaching. HE WAS
[2:34:17] WORN PLUM out from ministering to the
[2:34:19] people. AND HE WAS BACK THERE ASLEEP in
[2:34:21] the back of the vessel. AND HE SAID
[2:34:23] THERE WAS 10,000 DEVILS ON THE SEA THAT
[2:34:26] SWORE THEY WERE GOING TO DROWN HIM.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; He's tired. He's weary. He's resting.
[2:34:36] That was a man.
[2:34:44] But when he put his foot up on the brow
[2:34:47] of that boat,
[2:34:51] no more tiredness, no more weariness, no
[2:34:54] more, it was all business. THEN WHEN HE
[2:34:56] PUT HIS foot up on the brow of that boat
[2:34:58] and he SAID, "PEACE BE STILL." THAT WAS
[2:35:00] MORE THAN A MAN. THAT WAS GOD ON the
[2:35:03] scene, brothers and sisters.
[2:35:09] When a woman come to him 12 years with a
[2:35:11] blood issue,
[2:35:19] she comes to him and she touches the hem
[2:35:22] of his garment.
[2:35:28] I don't have the detailed notes here,
[2:35:30] but we'll share what we know. We'll
[2:35:32] share it with you. In in Hebrew Jewish,
[2:35:35] the religion there, the the hem of the
[2:35:37] garment is considered the wings.
[2:35:39] The Bible says there's healing in the
[2:35:42] wings.
[2:35:44] So Jesus has his his his mock his smock
[2:35:47] on, whatever you want to call it, the
[2:35:48] robe. And at the bottom of his robe is a
[2:35:51] little fringes. And this woman WHO'S HAD
[2:35:53] A BLOOD ISSUE FOR 12 YEARS, BATTLING HER
[2:35:56] WAY THROUGH THE CROWD, SHE SAYS, "IF I
[2:35:57] COULD JUST GET TO THAT MAN, THAT'S GOT
[2:36:00] HEALING in his wings, AND IF I COULD
[2:36:03] JUST TOUCH THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT, I
[2:36:06] KNOW MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME
[2:36:12] AFTER 12 YEARS OF A BLOOD ISSUE." GONE.
[2:36:21] Here's Jarius's daughter. We're trying
[2:36:23] to find a place to get off here.
[2:36:26] Here's Jarius's daughter. Jarius's
[2:36:28] daughter's laying there. She's been
[2:36:29] sick. AND HE'S GOT SO MUCH confidence in
[2:36:31] Jesus. HE'S HEARD ALL ABOUT this man
[2:36:34] named Jesus. AND HE'S GOT so much
[2:36:36] confidence. AND NOW JARIUS'S daughter is
[2:36:38] sitting there. And her heart begins to
[2:36:40] fail.
[2:36:42] And she passes on over.
[2:36:47] and she's passed over laying there dead.
[2:36:52] Jesus is on his way
[2:36:56] and the messenger comes to Jarius and
[2:36:57] says, "Jarius, I hate to have to tell
[2:37:00] you this,
[2:37:02] but your daughter's already dead.
[2:37:05] There's no need for you to trouble the
[2:37:07] master."
[2:37:11] Jarius's heart falls.
[2:37:14] He begins to weep.
[2:37:16] He begins to cry. And he turns around
[2:37:19] and he looks into those dark eyes of
[2:37:21] Jesus.
[2:37:23] And Jesus says, "Did I not say, "Fear
[2:37:26] not."
[2:37:29] Did I not say, "Fear not,
[2:37:32] for thou shalt see the glory of God."
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have to walk through the
[2:37:40] gate.
[2:37:43] Did I not say that you're going to see
[2:37:45] the glory of God? And Jesus then walks
[2:37:49] into the death chamber.
[2:37:52] It was not a hospital anymore. Now we're
[2:37:54] in a morg.
[2:37:56] And he walks into the death chamber
[2:37:58] where those people were in there. And he
[2:38:01] says, "She's not dead. She's just
[2:38:03] asleep."
[2:38:06] They said, "Look at listen to this guy.
[2:38:09] Listen to this guy.
[2:38:12] In other words, this guy's crazy.
[2:38:15] He has not been to medical school. He's
[2:38:18] not a doctor. HE HAS NOT STUDIED. HE
[2:38:20] DOES NOT KNOW. WE SAW the very life
[2:38:22] leave out of her. She's not breathed in
[2:38:24] ours. BUT LITTLE DO THEY KNOW THAT THEY
[2:38:26] WERE STANDING IN THE PRESENCE of the
[2:38:27] great physician himself, the one and
[2:38:30] only healer of all diseases, all
[2:38:32] afflictions. And he looks over there and
[2:38:35] HE SAYS, "GET THEM OUT OF HERE."
[2:38:38] YOU SEE, HE didn't have room for doubt
[2:38:40] to be around me.
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; Get them out of here.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; When I'm going through something, I
[2:38:46] don't have room for doubt to be around
[2:38:47] me. If you're going to come telling me
[2:38:48] how bad my MY SITUATION IS, STAY AWAY.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want you around me.
[2:38:57] But if you're going to come and TELL ME
[2:38:59] HOW GOOD MY GOD is and HOW BIG OF A
[2:39:02] HEALER HE IS, HOW MANY TIMES HE'S
[2:39:04] DELIVERED, if you're going to tell ME
[2:39:06] THOSE KINDS OF THINGS, COME TALK TO ME.
[2:39:08] COME SING ME A SONG AND WE'LL PRAISE GOD
[2:39:10] TOGETHER.
[2:39:16] Get him out OF HERE. AND HE PUT HIM OUT
[2:39:18] OF THE ROOM and he says, "Now there he
[2:39:21] was possessed of the power not of man
[2:39:26] but of the Holy Ghost."
[2:39:29] You see, Jesus was a man, but he was
[2:39:32] more than a man.
[2:39:37] At the time when all earthly things, all
[2:39:40] the man's ideas, they're going to fail.
[2:39:42] All these things are falling around. He
[2:39:45] looks down at this little girl, this
[2:39:46] little damsel there that's taken her
[2:39:48] breath hour, her last breath hours
[2:39:50] before, and he says,
[2:39:52] "Tella,
[2:39:56] little girl,
[2:39:59] also interpreted as little lamb,
[2:40:03] get up.
[2:40:05] Arise.
[2:40:08] Arise.
[2:40:10] That wasn't a man.
[2:40:13] He was speaking in a foreign tongue. He
[2:40:15] was speaking in another language. He was
[2:40:17] speaking under the uncction of the Holy
[2:40:19] Ghost. NOT AS A MAN NO MORE, BUT TO
[2:40:21] LITHIA. GET UP, LITTLE GIRL. Get up.
[2:40:24] COME BACK TO LIFE. COME BACK FROM WHERE
[2:40:26] THE SPIRIT LAND THAT YOU'RE FROM. He
[2:40:28] said, you're not laying there dead
[2:40:30] anymore.
[2:40:34] And that girl,
[2:40:38] I said, that girl stood to her feet.
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; The girl that was once dead stood to her
[2:40:50] feet and lived again. Brothers and
[2:40:52] sisters, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR
[2:40:53] SITUATION IS. IF WE'LL ALLOW GOD TO COME
[2:40:55] INTO OUR LIVES, YOU SAY, "I'M COLD. I'M
[2:40:57] BACKSLID. I'M INFORMAL." LET GOD COME IN
[2:41:00] AND SEE IF YOU DON'T live again.
[2:41:08] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[2:41:11] and forever.
[2:41:14] Let's stand to our feet. I got to quit.
[2:41:21] Our Emmanuel
[2:41:24] be with us forever. He said, "I'll never
[2:41:27] leave you. I'll never forsake you. I'll
[2:41:30] be with you. I'll be even in you to the
[2:41:32] end of the world. That's our God. You
[2:41:36] know, there are seven compound names of
[2:41:37] Jehovah. Jehovah Gyra, my provider.
[2:41:40] Jehovah Rafa, the Lord who heals.
[2:41:42] Jehovah Ni, the Lord my banner. Jehovah
[2:41:45] Shalom, the Lord my peace. Jehovah Rah,
[2:41:48] the Lord my shepherd. Jehovah Sakanu,
[2:41:52] the Lord our righteousness. Jehovah
[2:41:55] Shyama, the Lord is there. Brothers and
[2:42:00] sisters, that was Old Testament.
[2:42:03] We've got the New Testament. We've got
[2:42:05] God our healer. God our deliverer. God
[2:42:08] our for our forgiver. God our burden
[2:42:11] bearer. God the restorer of our
[2:42:13] families. The God the restorer of our
[2:42:14] homes. The God restorer of our bodies.
[2:42:18] WE GOT A GOD who's a redeemer.
[2:42:20] Let me TELL YOU, HE HE'S HERE TONIGHT.
[2:42:23] HE'S here this morning. He's here this
[2:42:26] morning. And he's here in us in a in a
[2:42:28] in a mighty way.
[2:42:33] Put that song up there, brothers. He's
[2:42:34] in the house.
[2:42:41] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:42:45] Bear with us. We're trying to get things
[2:42:47] figured out here.
[2:42:50] You know this song.
[2:42:56] This is talking about Jarius's daughter.
[2:43:00] But let's don't place Jarius's daughter.
[2:43:02] Let's place us there. He's in this
[2:43:05] house.
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; He's not in a manger. He's not somewhere
[2:43:10] in a manger, but he's in this house.
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; He's in this church. He's here to
[2:43:14] deliver. He's here to give what?
[2:43:16] Everything that you have need of.
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:43:20] Let's sing this. Little girl was lying
[2:43:24] there.
[2:43:26] People all were weeping.
[2:43:30] They just laughed at Jesus
[2:43:34] and said, "She's only sleeping."
[2:43:38] As he took her by the hand,
[2:43:42] she began to live again.
[2:43:46] Some begin to praise the Lord.
[2:43:50] Some begin to say,
[2:43:55] "He's in the house.
[2:43:59] Death has to flee.
[2:44:03] Now there is life
[2:44:06] where darkness used to be.
[2:44:10] Now there is hope.
[2:44:14] There's no more doubt.
[2:44:18] Praise his name.
[2:44:21] Praise his name.
[2:44:25] He's in the house.
[2:44:31] We were like that little girl,
[2:44:35] dead in all our sins.
[2:44:38] till Jesus touched this heart of mine
[2:44:42] and gave me life again.
[2:44:46] I am just a house of clay.
[2:44:50] Ever since that blessed day,
[2:44:54] there's a light that shines on me for
[2:44:57] all the world to see.
[2:45:01] He's in the house.
[2:45:04] Death has to flee.
[2:45:09] Hallelujah.
[2:45:11] There's life
[2:45:13] where it used to be so dark and cold,
[2:45:16] now we have hope.
[2:45:18] There's no more doubt.
[2:45:21] Oh, praise his name.
[2:45:26] Praise his name.
[2:45:30] He's in the house.
[2:45:34] He's in the house.
[2:45:37] Death had to flee.
[2:45:41] Now there is life
[2:45:44] where darkness used to be.
[2:45:48] Now there is hope.
[2:45:52] There's no more doubt.
[2:45:56] Praise his name.
[2:45:59] Praise his name.
[2:46:03] He's in the house. else.
[2:46:07] You love him this morning. Give him a
[2:46:09] hand clap of praise.
[2:46:12] I just want to speak the name of Jesus.

[2:46:18] How many knows the importance of that
[2:46:19] name in Jesus? Brother Tommy, I say

[2:47:18] freedom.
[2:47:21] I speak Jesus.

[2:47:30] power.

[2:50:59] We bless your name, Lord Jesus. We bless
[2:51:02] your name. We praise you, Father, that
[2:51:04] is morning. Lord, from the bottom of our
[2:51:07] heart, Lord Jesus, we are beneficiaries
[2:51:10] of your life that you live when you was
[2:51:12] here on earth, Lord. We're beneficiaries
[2:51:15] of your resurrection, Lord Jesus. We're
[2:51:18] just beneficiaries of you, Lord Jesus.
[2:51:21] Father, and we ask, Lord, that you would
[2:51:22] just, Father, fill each and every heart,
[2:51:25] Lord, this morning. If there's any Lord
[2:51:27] that's not saved, God, may they not pass
[2:51:30] by this day without getting saved and
[2:51:32] filled with your Holy Spirit, accepting
[2:51:34] what you've done for us, Lord Jesus, for
[2:51:36] them, Lord, on Calvar's tree, Lord, and
[2:51:39] all that you have done, Father. Thank
[2:51:41] you for speaking to our hearts, Lord
[2:51:43] Jesus, this morning. We give you praise,
[2:51:46] Father, for your goodness to us. We love
[2:51:48] you with all of our heart, Father, for
[2:51:50] you first loved us, Lord, and you gave
[2:51:52] your life for us, Lord Jesus. and we
[2:51:55] give our life to you, Lord. We're
[2:51:57] willing, Lord, to die to oursel, to take
[2:51:59] up our cross, and to follow you, Lord
[2:52:02] Jesus. We're not ashamed of you, God.
[2:52:04] And Lord, I know on that day, you won't
[2:52:06] be ashamed of us, Lord. But if you are
[2:52:09] ashamed of us, if we're ashamed of you
[2:52:11] here, you'll be ashamed of us, though,
[2:52:13] Lord. And if we're ashamed to confess
[2:52:15] you here, you'll not confess us there
[2:52:17] before the Father and all of his holy
[2:52:19] angels. So Lord, we confess that we
[2:52:22] believe you. We accept you and we love
[2:52:24] you with all of our heart. Lord, more
[2:52:26] than anything else, there's nothing else
[2:52:28] in this world worth living for. Father,
[2:52:31] we thank you for this service, Lord
[2:52:32] Jesus. Thank you for brother Brad, Lord,
[2:52:35] just yielding himself, Lord, to you,
[2:52:36] God, this morning and speaking through
[2:52:38] him, Father, to to hearts, Father, this
[2:52:41] morning, Lord. Father, and I pray, Lord,
[2:52:43] that it'll fall on that good, fertile
[2:52:45] ground, Lord. May people believe, Lord,
[2:52:47] for whatever they need, Lord, this
[2:52:50] morning. Whatever it is, nothing is too
[2:52:52] big for you, Lord. If you can open red
[2:52:55] seas, Lord. Lord, if you can do that,
[2:52:57] you can do anything, Lord Jesus. If you
[2:52:59] can stop the sun and the moon, Amen, for
[2:53:01] Joshua, God, you can stop the world.
[2:53:04] Amen. Amen. If we'll just believe, Amen.
[2:53:06] with all of our heart. We love you, Lord
[2:53:08] Jesus, this morning. We just want to
