[34:03] that I was telling brother Thomas and
[34:04] brother Brad in the back before we get
[34:06] started tonight that the Lord laid this
[34:08] thought on my heart and I thought I was
[34:09] going to preach it Sunday but brother
[34:12] Thomas and sister Donna neither one was
[34:14] here and when brother Thomas invited me
[34:16] to come he put this on my heart for
[34:19] sister Donna so tonight we're just going
[34:21] to believe I know all of us have a need
[34:24] but we understand that there's a great
[34:25] need back there but we also understand
[34:27] we ser serve a great big God who's able
[34:29] to meet that need so tonight I want to
[34:32] speak to you on and I give it a title
[34:34] it's not over yet it's not over yet and
[34:37] we'll look here in 2 Corinthians 4 we're
[34:40] going to start at verse 5 and I'm kind
[34:42] of going to back up and forth here once
[34:44] we get down and I'll have you seated but
[34:46] so for we preach not ourselves but
[34:48] Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[34:51] servant for Jesus's sake for God who
[34:54] commanded the light to shine out of
[34:56] Darkness has shined in our hearts to
[34:59] give the light of the knowledge of the
[35:00] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[35:03] but we have this treasure in Earth and
[35:06] vessels that the Excell Excellency of
[35:09] the power may be of God and not of us
[35:11] we're troubled on every side yet not
[35:13] distressed we're perplexed but not in
[35:15] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[35:18] down but not destroyed always bearing
[35:21] about in the body the dying of the Lord
[35:23] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[35:25] be made manifest in our body skip down
[35:28] to verse
[35:29] 14 knowing that he which rais up the
[35:32] Lord Jesus shall also or he that rais up
[35:35] the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by
[35:38] Jesus and shall present us with you for
[35:40] all things are for your sakes that the
[35:43] abundant grace might through the
[35:44] Thanksgiving May redown to the glory of
[35:47] God for which cause we faint not but
[35:49] though the outward man perish yet the
[35:51] inward man is New Day by Day for our
[35:54] light Affliction which is yet but a
[35:56] moment worketh for us a far more
[35:58] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory
[36:01] while we look not on the things which
[36:03] are seen but the things that are not
[36:04] seen for the things which are seen are
[36:07] temporal but the things which are not
[36:09] seen are Eternal God bless you you can
[36:13] have your seats this
[36:16] evening I don't see brother Tommy he
[36:19] didn't make it tonight oh there he is I
[36:21] can't hardly see nothing that's the
[36:22] honest thing I left my glasses at the
[36:25] room and I usually just need readers but
[36:28] tonight looks like I I can't see a face
[36:30] out there so that may be a good thing
[36:31] but also want to look here at another
[36:33] scripture 1 Peter 5 and ver8 very quick
[36:37] it says be sober otherwise that means
[36:39] not
[36:41] intoxicated be sober be vigilent because
[36:44] your adversary deser the devil as a
[36:47] roaring line walketh about seeking whom
[36:51] he may
[36:53] devour amen this word devour here as we
[36:57] look at it means to drink to swallow up
[36:59] to Gul down to absorb to engulf to
[37:02] submerge to overwhelm to swallow greedly
[37:05] to devour to destroy to annihilate your
[37:08] enemy seeks to annihilate you tonight he
[37:11] seeks to overwhelm you tonight and he
[37:15] has many facets of overwhelming the mind
[37:17] of the people and the hearts of the
[37:19] people and we understand that Satan does
[37:21] all that he has and he does all that's
[37:23] in his power to try to destroy the elect
[37:27] of of God you understand that you here
[37:30] tonight are his main
[37:33] focus you're his goal tonight his goal
[37:37] is to destroy you to annihilate you to
[37:41] stop you from progressing in your walk
[37:43] with God but I also want you to know
[37:45] tonight that you are God's main
[37:48] focus Satan is after you but God is for
[37:51] you tonight and if Satan can put so much
[37:54] power so much energy so much Focus us
[37:57] into trying to keep you from becoming
[38:00] what God has called you to be how much
[38:03] more tonight Church of the Living God
[38:05] it's God's focus on you tonight he said
[38:08] you're the apple of his
[38:11] eye woo my think about it l oh you
[38:16] tonight in epton Kentucky are the apple
[38:19] of God's eye tonight and no matter what
[38:22] you're going through no matter what
[38:24] you're facing on this side there ain't
[38:26] enough power in the Demons of Darkness
[38:28] there ain't enough power in the Dooms of
[38:30] Hell tonight to stop you and to stop our
[38:34] God and can I put the devil on notice
[38:37] tonight he may be trying you he may be
[38:40] attacking you he may be coming against
[38:42] you but it ain't over
[38:44] yet the god that we serve brother Thomas
[38:48] he has the final
[38:52] say I told myself I wasn't going to get
[38:55] excited I lied on
[38:57] notice Satan does all within his power
[39:00] to try to stop
[39:02] us but you're here
[39:04] tonight some of you tried to throw in
[39:07] the towel but you're here tonight some
[39:09] of you tried to quit but you're here
[39:12] tonight why because the devil don't have
[39:14] enough to stop God's bride he don't have
[39:17] enough to stop you
[39:21] tonight and as long as we're in these
[39:24] bodies as long as we're in this world
[39:28] we're going to face
[39:31] trouble all right Ain't nobody got Wings
[39:35] here
[39:36] tonight we're going to have hard times
[39:40] difficult
[39:42] times and but the Bible says though the
[39:45] outward
[39:47] man this outward thing that we call the
[39:52] the body or the humanity and whatever
[39:55] name you want to give it this thing will
[39:57] embarrass
[39:58] you it would ridicule
[40:01] you look I'm about to be 50 years old in
[40:04] 3 months and I wake up every day going
[40:07] oh my
[40:08] god when I was 25 I didn't wake up
[40:11] saying that I said praise God today I'm
[40:14] waking up oh my God we got a new ache we
[40:17] got a new pain we got a new this we got
[40:19] a new that there's trying times as we
[40:22] progress along but I want you to know
[40:25] tonight we serve a great big God tonight
[40:29] and though the outward man perish though
[40:31] this flesh perish the inward man let me
[40:34] tell you Satan can't get to the inward
[40:36] man he can Tu this outward man he can
[40:39] bring it down to destruction but this
[40:41] inward man is Renew Day by
[40:45] Day
[40:47] Hallelujah you can come against my body
[40:50] you can come against my mind but you
[40:52] can't come against this soul of mine
[40:54] because it belongs to God tonight
[41:00] Hallelujah the outward man perishes but
[41:03] the inward man is
[41:05] renewed the outward man is in feeble but
[41:08] the inward man is
[41:10] strengthened the outward man grows old
[41:13] he
[41:14] decays but the inward man renews his
[41:17] strength and is invigorated in its
[41:21] youth let me tell you young people you
[41:23] may not think much about that right now
[41:27] but one day these scriptures or this
[41:29] thought here will be a reality to
[41:32] you though this outward man
[41:35] perish oh there's something in a heart
[41:37] of a Believer longs to to see God it's
[41:41] renewed by reading the word of God it's
[41:43] renewed by studying the message of
[41:47] God I like what it says here in verse
[41:49] four 2 Corinthians or verse 7 excuse me
[41:52] it says but we have this treasure so
[41:57] Brother Brad I was looking at that today
[41:58] I'm like what is he talking about now
[42:00] Paul is is telling us here we have this
[42:05] treasure in Earth and
[42:09] vessels sometimes we don't want to put
[42:11] treasure in Earth and vessels in
[42:13] humanity do we CU Humanity will
[42:16] disappoint
[42:17] you Humanity will fail
[42:21] you Humanity will hurt
[42:25] you not intentionally hopefully but it
[42:28] does but Paul is here is saying we have
[42:32] this treasure in Earth and vessels that
[42:35] the Excellency of the power may be of
[42:38] God and not of us so I've started
[42:41] looking back at the beginning of this
[42:43] chapter in verse one it says therefore
[42:45] seeing we have this
[42:48] ministry so otherwise Paul is pointing
[42:51] back the treasure that we have Paul is
[42:54] saying in his day the treasure that we
[42:56] have is this ministry otherwise the
[43:00] treasure that we hold in Earth and
[43:02] vessels is the message of the hour Paul
[43:06] was proclaiming in that age in the
[43:08] Ephesian age that the treasure that the
[43:10] believer possessed was The Treasure of
[43:13] the message of the
[43:16] hour the ministry of the Gospel of Jesus
[43:21] Christ you said brother Joe are you sure
[43:23] go to verse three but if our gospel Paul
[43:27] still speaking here if it be hid is hid
[43:29] from them that are
[43:31] lost and the gospel is the good news is
[43:34] it
[43:36] not to me it's good
[43:38] news so The Treasure of the Gospel the
[43:41] rich and invaluable truths which they
[43:44] are called to preach to others so when
[43:47] you come to the church you come and you
[43:49] listen to tapes and different things of
[43:50] that nature go to meetings and
[43:53] camps you should count it a
[43:56] treasure the words that are proceeding
[43:59] out of the man's mouth it's not his own
[44:02] thoughts but it's the mind of God coming
[44:06] out and expressing itself to the people
[44:09] as the gospel the good news so this word
[44:11] treasure here is applied to truth on the
[44:14] account of their inestimable worth
[44:17] otherwise you can't put a price on it in
[44:20] one scripture they would say it's to
[44:22] Pearl of great
[44:25] price the gospel
[44:27] and if that's not what it means to you
[44:29] you need to come to the
[44:32] altar it should mean everything to
[44:37] you the gospel the good news it means
[44:41] that whatever is in this
[44:44] word no matter what it ask of us to do
[44:48] to how we should dress how we should
[44:51] behave how we should act how we should
[44:53] conduct oursel what we should believe
[44:55] what we should uh what whatever it may
[44:57] be we should come under subjection to
[45:00] the
[45:01] word cuz it's a
[45:04] treasure now let me just say this if I
[45:07] had a million dollars here tonight with
[45:09] me and I stuck it in a vessel in the
[45:10] back and I said hey first one comes to
[45:12] the altar first one comes up here I'm
[45:14] going to give you the access code to the
[45:17] treasure y'all all be streaming up here
[45:19] right
[45:20] now come on who don't want a million
[45:25] bucks but what he's given us Paul is giv
[45:29] us is something that far exceeds a
[45:31] million dollars your million dollars
[45:33] will Rust your million dollars will burn
[45:35] up your million dollars will canker and
[45:37] go down to the grave but what God is giv
[45:39] us tonight is The Treasure of the Gospel
[45:42] that'll lift you out of here and change
[45:44] your body and heal your sickness and
[45:47] deliver your children it'll take you out
[45:49] of this
[45:50] realm I'm talking about The Treasure of
[45:53] the
[45:55] Gospel not just the word preached but
[45:58] the word preached in power and
[46:00] manifestation of the words of
[46:03] God anybody can stand behind here and
[46:05] quote scripture quote quotes but I'm
[46:08] talking about the gospel being preached
[46:10] by the anointing of the Holy
[46:14] Spirit Paul said I came not with
[46:17] enticing words of
[46:21] man no but Paul preached he demonstrated
[46:25] the reality
[46:27] of the
[46:31] word he preached the reality so after
[46:35] brother Brandon went off the scene what
[46:36] have we done as a Mist Community we went
[46:38] we seed seeds of
[46:41] theology 60 years of
[46:44] theology message theology theology
[46:47] theology theology but where is the
[46:50] manifestation of the
[46:52] theology oh church I'm here to tell you
[46:55] tonight Satan's trying to drown it out
[46:57] and give you well it's thus sayth the
[46:59] message it's thus sayth the message what
[47:01] let me tell you if it never comes on
[47:03] your Humanity if it never manifest in
[47:06] your church in your home in your life it
[47:09] ain't th sayth the message but when it
[47:12] becomes a living reality Hallelujah when
[47:15] it becomes a manifestation then it
[47:18] becomes your ring
[47:22] reality the message in the Bible has to
[47:25] come off pages
[47:29] it has to come off the pages and it has
[47:32] to come in the heart I don't care if
[47:34] you're young if you're old if you're
[47:36] blind whatever it may be it's got to be
[47:39] more than books on a shelf it's got to
[47:42] be more than takes on a on a record
[47:44] player it's got to be a living
[47:50] manifestation and you don't think the
[47:52] prophet of God will want this word that
[47:54] he preached begin to manifest
[47:57] it's got to be more than just quoting
[47:59] what he
[48:01] said but it's living what he
[48:06] said it's a treasure that just struck me
[48:09] today brother Thomas a
[48:11] treasure I treasure it there's not a
[48:14] moment that I or a day that I don't wake
[48:16] up and I thank God for this message
[48:19] there's not a time that I lay my head on
[48:21] the bed at night that I don't thank God
[48:24] for this message cuz I know where I was
[48:28] Brother David I know the life I used to
[48:32] live and I know the joy of my heart
[48:35] tonight I know the love that I have for
[48:38] the things of God tonight but let me
[48:40] just go little let's go on now cuz I
[48:41] don't want to get buried down there but
[48:43] we look here in verse eight it says we
[48:44] are
[48:46] troubled on every
[48:48] side we are troubled
[48:51] we not just
[48:53] you sometimes we think well it's just me
[48:57] no it didn't say me it said we we are
[49:00] troubled it ain't just you it's not just
[49:02] the preachers it's not just the deacons
[49:04] it's not just the pastors it's not just
[49:06] this group this church but the Bible
[49:09] says we are troubled on every side yet
[49:12] not
[49:14] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[49:17] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[49:20] down but not
[49:22] destroyed so we look at
[49:24] this and we find a negative
[49:28] connotation and if you're not careful
[49:31] all that you focus on is the negative
[49:36] connotation see we look at the
[49:38] scriptures and oh we're troubled and all
[49:41] we focus on is all the trouble if you
[49:44] just knew what I've been through brother
[49:47] Joe you find people oh come
[49:50] on man they'll lock you up in a meeting
[49:53] and all of a sudden you're out there in
[49:54] the vegetable or the foyer or out side
[49:57] man they want to unload years of trouble
[49:59] I'm like I ain't got enough time for
[50:02] that y'all know uh what was her name
[50:06] Shirley not Shirley C liquor what was
[50:07] her name Sweet
[50:09] Brown no y'all don't watch YouTube do
[50:12] you y'all saved church that's good
[50:15] you're doing a good job brother
[50:18] Thomas well she done had bronc she said
[50:21] ain't nobody got time for that yeah
[50:24] y'all remember her sweet brown or
[50:25] whatever her name was was well that's
[50:27] what no Joe you got to get out of
[50:30] junkyard business and start watching
[50:31] some
[50:33] YouTube but we find here Satan loves to
[50:37] make you feel like you're the only
[50:40] one I'm the only one going through what
[50:43] I'm going
[50:45] through come on somebody I'm the only
[50:48] one brother Joe you don't understand
[50:50] everybody's against me they don't
[50:52] understand my pride I'm the only one
[50:54] dealing with this no you're not
[50:59] there's been sons of God there's been
[51:01] Daughters of God down through 2,000
[51:03] years down through seven Church ages
[51:06] that's been through what you're going
[51:07] through and they made it let me tell you
[51:09] if they made it you'll make it it wasn't
[51:13] over for them and it ain't over for
[51:17] you but Satan wants you to think you're
[51:19] the only one so we understand that this
[51:21] Christian life is going to have its
[51:23] share of hardships and difficulties
[51:27] but can I tell you they're not
[51:30] permanent they're not permanent the
[51:32] Bible says that we look not at the
[51:36] things which are
[51:38] seen but a lot of times that's all we
[51:40] can put our eyes on is the things that
[51:42] are seen things that are felt things
[51:44] that we you know we go through we look
[51:47] at those things and wow they're they
[51:49] become the reality for most of us but he
[51:53] says we don't look at the things which
[51:54] are seen but the things which are not
[51:56] seen why is that brother Joe why is that
[51:59] Pastor Paul for the things which are
[52:02] seen are
[52:05] temporal otherwise that hardship you're
[52:07] going through is temporal that trial
[52:10] you're facing is temporal that sickness
[52:12] is temporal his temporal what is he
[52:15] saying take your eyes off of that and
[52:17] put your eyes back on the word of God
[52:19] for the things that are not seen the
[52:22] things that you can't see the things
[52:24] that you can't taste the things that you
[52:26] can't feel those things are Eternal
[52:29] those things have value what is he
[52:31] talking about he's talking about faith
[52:33] to overcome Faith to rise up and stand
[52:36] your ground and say it's thus sayith the
[52:38] Lord for
[52:42] me we're going to face
[52:46] difficulties but where where we find
[52:48] these
[52:50] things we're not to look at
[52:53] times we are to look
[52:57] at
[52:59] Jesus look your Prophet preach the
[53:02] message look and
[53:07] live maybe you're not going through what
[53:09] sister Donna is going through tonight
[53:12] and I asked earlier this this morning I
[53:14] said how are you feeling she said it's
[53:17] unbelievable I've never had one
[53:22] fear cuz she's not looking at the
[53:25] diagnosis
[53:27] SE she's not looking at the lump in the
[53:30] breast she's not looking at the scan
[53:32] that the doctor she's looking to looking
[53:34] at the things that are temporal she's
[53:37] looking at the things that are
[53:40] Eternal and if I can get you tonight to
[53:43] take your eyes off the things that are
[53:45] temporal and put your eyes back on the
[53:47] things that are Eternal we will have a
[53:49] Hallelujah meeting tonight they will
[53:51] break forth joy unspeakable and full of
[53:54] Glory on a Wednesday night when it's 16°

[57:26] that it's to be grasped tightly so if
[57:30] you're troubled and you're in somebody's
[57:32] grasp like I'm grabbing this
[57:35] microphone I got it completely
[57:37] surrounded by my hands and it here it
[57:41] means it protrays to be grasped tightly
[57:44] to be squeezed to be brought to distress
[57:47] CU you don't see how you can get out of
[57:50] the antagonist hands how are you going
[57:53] to be removed from the clutch of that
[57:57] trouble no doubt sister Donna when you
[57:59] got that call or when you went to the
[58:01] and got that scan and got the report
[58:03] maybe you felt a little bit of that
[58:05] trouble but the Bible says we're
[58:07] troubled on every side but yet not
[58:10] distressed tonight that word distress
[58:13] there means as though we have no hope as
[58:16] though we have no way of Escape I don't
[58:18] care where the devil has you tonight we
[58:21] are a people that are not in distress
[58:23] tonight we are a people that have hope
[58:25] we have faith we have joy we have the
[58:28] word of
[58:33] God then we come down to the second part
[58:36] of it it says we're
[58:39] perplexed that word perplexed there
[58:42] means sometimes we don't know what to do
[58:45] have any of you ever been to that place
[58:48] in your Christian walk or maybe in your
[58:51] just your Humanity let's just bring it
[58:52] to that place you're facing a decision
[58:55] your place you're facing an obstacle a
[58:57] trial a situation and you just don't
[59:01] know what to
[59:03] do
[59:04] perplexed we're troubled oh my but yet
[59:08] not in
[59:09] distress we're perplexed and there's
[59:12] times we don't know what course to steer
[59:14] or how we're going to be relieved how
[59:16] we're going to be
[59:17] supplied sometimes we're even at an
[59:19] uttermost loss for the things that we
[59:22] face that are temporal but the Bible
[59:24] says yet not in
[59:28] despair that means we're not at a
[59:31] complete loss or absence of hope that's
[59:34] right that's why we look to Jesus and
[59:39] live let me just say this and I'm sure
[59:41] brother Thomas doesn't mind but you
[59:43] can't look to your pastor and live
[59:45] tonight you can't look to Brother Brad
[59:48] another Minister and live tonight young
[59:50] people you can't look to Mama and Daddy
[59:53] you can't look to your favorite preacher
[59:55] you got a to look to Jesus and live you
[59:58] got to look back to the word of God and
[1:00:01] live tonight because I'm going tell you
[1:00:03] when the pastor's gone because old age
[1:00:05] is kicked in and he's gone by the way of
[1:00:07] the Grave God will still be with you
[1:00:09] when Mama and Daddy ain't there for you
[1:00:11] God will still be with you when your
[1:00:13] friends are forsaken you God will still
[1:00:15] be with you
[1:00:17] tonight look to him tonight and
[1:00:21] live the Bible says also we're
[1:00:24] persecuted now we all know by
[1:00:26] persecution it means to be pursued from
[1:00:28] place to place followed with mines and
[1:00:30] curses and reproaches laid hold on in
[1:00:34] prison threatened with the severest
[1:00:38] tortures but yet the Bible says we're
[1:00:40] not
[1:00:41] forsaken oh you may be persecuted you
[1:00:44] may be sought after but we're not
[1:00:47] forsaken we're not brother Thomas we
[1:00:50] have not been abandoned by almighty
[1:00:53] God you may feel that you're the only
[1:00:56] one but you're not alone you may feel
[1:00:59] that everybody's left you and forsaken
[1:01:01] you but he has never left you nor
[1:01:04] forsaken
[1:01:06] you then it says that we are cast down
[1:01:09] that means to be dashed to Pieces it's
[1:01:11] kind of a wrestling term and it means
[1:01:13] that in a wrestling term is when the
[1:01:16] first one throws the other opponent down
[1:01:18] then that one that's standing is to
[1:01:20] conquer and many times we have felt
[1:01:22] thrown down by the enemy
[1:01:26] we are felt overwhelmed by the trial by
[1:01:28] the situation by whatever it is that
[1:01:30] you're going through and but the Bible
[1:01:32] says we're cast down but yet not
[1:01:36] destroyed oh Satan may have thrown you
[1:01:38] down this evening or this week or this
[1:01:41] year but let me tell you we're not cast
[1:01:43] down brother Thomas we get up to fight
[1:01:45] again we get up to live again we give up
[1:01:48] to say Amen to the word I'm still coming
[1:01:52] I'm still believing I'm still trusting
[1:01:54] tonight
[1:02:00] though we're troubled on every
[1:02:02] side though we're perplexed though we're
[1:02:05] persecuted though we're cast
[1:02:08] down I don't find one
[1:02:11] scripture in all of the Old Testament
[1:02:14] nor in the New Testament brother Tomy it
[1:02:17] ever says you're
[1:02:19] defeated did you hear me
[1:02:22] somebody if you can find one place that
[1:02:25] you're defe needed let me tell you we
[1:02:27] might as well walk away and give up but
[1:02:29] as long as there's not a word in the
[1:02:30] Bible says that all the scriptures is
[1:02:33] inspired by God and if all the word is
[1:02:36] inspired by God and there's not one word
[1:02:38] written about your demise there's not
[1:02:41] one word written about your defeat that
[1:02:43] tells me right there that that devil
[1:02:45] don't have enough tonight he may put
[1:02:47] this on you he may put sickness on you
[1:02:50] he may put cancer on you but I'm here to
[1:02:52] say it ain't over yet it a ain't over
[1:02:56] yet
[1:02:58] Church there's nothing written in the
[1:03:00] word about your defeat
[1:03:03] tonight but we can go to the back of the
[1:03:06] book I said we can go to the back of the
[1:03:09] book and we can read about his defeat we
[1:03:11] can read about his demise come on
[1:03:14] somebody don't you realize you're the
[1:03:17] you're more than a conqueror
[1:03:21] tonight though were troubled on every
[1:03:24] side
[1:03:27] yet I'm not
[1:03:31] defeated Romans 8:31 says what shall we

[1:03:39] us

[1:04:06] scriptures that as Sons and Daughters of

[1:04:10] difficulties but we're going to come
[1:04:13] out we're going to live sister da to
[1:04:16] fight another
[1:04:18] day I like what it says in Ephesians 6

[1:04:23] scriptures here not sure where my voice
[1:04:25] is going but sometimes we put these as

[1:07:30] originated it didn't happen down here in
[1:07:33] the garden of Adam and Eve but it
[1:07:35] happened in
[1:07:37] heaven but we find that's why many
[1:07:40] Christians even Believers we wrestle
[1:07:43] against
[1:07:45] anxieties

[1:14:27] from unbelief he's trying to get a
[1:14:30] people that'll believe his word and he
[1:14:32] told him he was told by an Angel if you

[1:18:05] God notice the word and then we look in
[1:18:08] John one in the beginning was what the
[1:18:11] word the Word was God the word was with
[1:18:16] God the same was in the beginning with
[1:18:18] God all things were made were made by
[1:18:20] him and without him was not anything
[1:18:21] made that was made verse 14 and the word
[1:18:25] was made flesh that word there is
[1:18:29] Loos so we're to be fortified behind the
[1:18:33] logos otherwise the only on the on the
[1:18:36] day of Pentecost the prophet of God said
[1:18:39] it was the logos it came and divided
[1:18:42] itself up and came and indwelled the
[1:18:46] people they now Brother David were were
[1:18:51] fully behind the the word of God fortifi
[1:18:55] behind the word of God they were they
[1:18:57] put on the whole armor of God and God
[1:19:01] came in this generation God came in this
[1:19:04] age when the Pentecostal fires blew out
[1:19:07] and it went down through the Dark Ages
[1:19:09] God raised up another Mighty messenger
[1:19:12] and under his message He restored the
[1:19:15] truth of of Pentecost and the true
[1:19:17] genuine filling of the Holy Ghost has
[1:19:20] been restored back in this day
[1:19:23] Church Paul had a portion let me tell
[1:19:26] you a Martin had a portion Wesley had a
[1:19:29] portion but in this generation you got
[1:19:31] all the portion you've got the token
[1:19:34] life on display it is Jesus Christ
[1:19:37] coming and dwelling and in encapsulating
[1:19:40] you with the whole armor of
[1:19:43] God don't you understand you can't make
[1:19:45] a Rapture without
[1:19:48] it I'm here to tell you you're not going
[1:19:52] to make a r without the armor
[1:19:55] play Church all you want to I'm trying
[1:19:57] to spare you I ain't saying you're not
[1:19:59] going to heaven that ain't for me to
[1:20:02] judge but I'm here to tell you if you
[1:20:04] don't have the armor of God you don't
[1:20:05] have the Holy Ghost not some sensation
[1:20:09] not some snot not some shout not some
[1:20:12] dance not some emotion I'm talking about
[1:20:14] having the person tonight if you don't
[1:20:17] have that you're not going in a Rapture
[1:20:20] you can find it in the
[1:20:22] message so while we have the opportunity
[1:20:26] and your first messenger and your
[1:20:28] seventh messenger are both telling us
[1:20:31] put on the whole armor of God because
[1:20:33] Paul knew what it meant to be filled
[1:20:35] with the Holy Ghost Paul knew what it
[1:20:38] meant to receive Revelation from on high
[1:20:40] and so did William brandham go into a
[1:20:43] cave and meet with an angel over and
[1:20:45] over and over he knew what it meant to
[1:20:47] be in the presence of the pillar of fire
[1:20:50] let me tell you and there's a people in
[1:20:52] the land today that knows what it means
[1:20:54] to be in the presence of the pillar of
[1:20:56] fire we know what it means to be in the
[1:20:59] presence of almighty
[1:21:05] God
[1:21:08] Hallelujah the whole armor of God is the
[1:21:11] Holy Ghost fortifi behind the word he
[1:21:14] says he comes in to try to find
[1:21:15] something what did he says Satan tries
[1:21:17] to come in and find something that God
[1:21:19] did then he tries to find a counteract
[1:21:21] to it but God God never has to change
[1:21:24] because he give them his word at the
[1:21:26] beginning he is infinite he cannot
[1:21:28] change it will still it's still his word
[1:21:31] today never changes from the word there
[1:21:33] he is in the word his church is
[1:21:35] fortified by the word his first person
[1:21:38] was fortified Eve but she stepped just
[1:21:41] for a minute to listen to Satan's
[1:21:44] tactics so young people when we talk to
[1:21:46] you about these things we're not trying
[1:21:48] to be big bad wolf we're not trying to
[1:21:50] be ugly parents we're not trying to be
[1:21:53] mean preachers we're trying to help you
[1:21:57] we're trying to point you to the
[1:21:59] light trying to show you there's a
[1:22:01] better
[1:22:02] way I know you don't believe it but some
[1:22:05] of us has been where you
[1:22:07] are when you get about 25 you're going
[1:22:10] to think man my mom and dad wasn't that
[1:22:11] dumb after
[1:22:13] all and then when you get saved and get
[1:22:15] filled with the Holy Ghost you going be
[1:22:16] like man I was
[1:22:19] stupid that preacher was right brother
[1:22:21] Thomas was right brother Brad was right
[1:22:23] brother Joe was
[1:22:26] right let me go on now notice so we find
[1:22:29] what is Satan's tactics today
[1:22:33] reasoning well you know really that's
[1:22:35] just brother brandom's
[1:22:41] idea that's just his
[1:22:43] idea this man met with an
[1:22:47] angel this man was
[1:22:50] Vindicated over and over and over I'm
[1:22:54] sorry you may be smart you may be
[1:22:57] superintelligent have a 180 IQ but I'm
[1:23:00] going to take this man's
[1:23:05] understanding over yours any
[1:23:10] day not trying to be ugly to you I know
[1:23:13] some of you are very smart and that's
[1:23:14] good Pat your Chef on the back when
[1:23:16] service is over but we're talking about
[1:23:20] equipping oursel to leave this place
[1:23:24] that when the battle's over we're going
[1:23:27] to leave when he comes we're going to
[1:23:30] meet him in the
[1:23:31] air so we find Satan uses reasoning well
[1:23:35] that's just brother brandom's idea you
[1:23:37] know oh my that's just brother Thomas's
[1:23:40] idea you know he grew up
[1:23:42] homish I mean he grew up homish now he
[1:23:44] trying to bring that into the
[1:23:46] church
[1:23:50] no that's how some of us
[1:23:52] think oh he goes to 10 puits you know
[1:23:55] he's a hillbilly he's on the other side
[1:23:57] of the you know all he knows how to do
[1:23:59] is raise
[1:24:00] goats sometimes that's what we think we
[1:24:02] think so little of men who are in the
[1:24:05] presence of God we think so little of
[1:24:07] people let me just say that not just men
[1:24:09] but people who are
[1:24:13] spiritual said there's a there's a
[1:24:15] Razor's Edge between insanity and
[1:24:20] spirituality you may think we're insane
[1:24:22] and let me tell you I hope you think I
[1:24:24] am
[1:24:26] cuz I am insanely in love with
[1:24:29] Jesus that I don't he said well brother
[1:24:33] Joe you done lost your mind brother Joe

[1:24:38] something years ago and I don't want my
[1:24:40] old mind back I'm glad to take the mind
[1:24:43] of Christ let me tell you somebody

[1:24:47] that was in Christ be in me he thought

[1:31:32] brother Thomas thank you for inviting
[1:31:37] me can I go a little further all right
[1:31:40] praise the Lord Matthew 19: 26 but Jesus
[1:31:44] beheld them and he said unto them with
[1:31:47] men this is
[1:31:50] impossible but with God all things are
[1:31:57] possible but you say well brother Joe
[1:31:59] you're saying all things are possible
[1:32:00] with God certainly we agree to that
[1:32:04] don't we
[1:32:07] church but let's just jump over into
[1:32:10] Mark 9 verse
[1:32:12] 23 y'all got somewhere y'all showing
[1:32:15] this nowhere we got nobody run a
[1:32:18] projector tonight do we oh my
[1:32:21] goodness that's okay I'll read
[1:32:25] y'all got your
[1:32:26] Bibles y'all need to write these two
[1:32:28] scriptures
[1:32:31] down because a lot of times we want to
[1:32:34] put it on
[1:32:36] God With God all things are possible
[1:32:40] well God ain't in my flesh right now God
[1:32:41] ain't in my trial God ain't in my
[1:32:43] sickness God ain't God God ain't God
[1:32:45] ain't but With God all things are
[1:32:46] possible but what about me what about my
[1:32:49] doctor's report what about my home
[1:32:52] that's tore up what about my marriage Us
[1:32:55] in
[1:32:58] shamas Look what Jesus does so you want
[1:33:01] to put it all on Jesus and say with
[1:33:04] Jesus everything's possible and
[1:33:06] certainly it
[1:33:07] is but Mark 9 verse 23 Jesus said unto
[1:33:11] him if thou can't
[1:33:15] believe if thou cast believe all things
[1:33:19] are possible to him that believeth
[1:33:24] so you want to put it on Jesus but Jesus
[1:33:26] is putting it back into your LA tonight
[1:33:29] if you can believe if you will believe
[1:33:31] tonight no matter what you're going
[1:33:33] through no matter what your trouble no
[1:33:35] matter what your perplexity no matter
[1:33:37] what what you're facing tonight if you
[1:33:39] can believe all things are possible
[1:33:43] tonight for the believer say brother Joe
[1:33:46] I believe tonight that have what you ask
[1:33:48] for ask anything in my name and I'll
[1:33:51] give it to you tonight that's just sayth
[1:33:53] the word of
[1:33:57] God he said you got to believe the
[1:34:00] impossible in order to have new life
[1:34:04] then he says in another place the
[1:34:06] impossibilities Are Made Real when God
[1:34:10] is taking at his
[1:34:12] word he said don't doubt anything just
[1:34:15] go right on believing it'll be all right
[1:34:17] God promis it God will perform it God
[1:34:20] watches over his word to keep it and to
[1:34:23] answer
[1:34:27] prayer impossible things this is in
[1:34:29] Jesus came and called but impossible
[1:34:32] things are made real when God has took
[1:34:34] at his word The Impossible is made
[1:34:37] realities when God is taken at his
[1:34:41] word he goes now how beautiful but even
[1:34:45] now
[1:34:46] Lord Lazar is 4 days late Mary had to
[1:34:50] believe for the
[1:34:51] impossible but even now
[1:34:54] Lord whatever you
[1:34:56] ask whatever you ask God on a Wednesday
[1:35:00] night even now Lord whatever you ask God
[1:35:03] it looks like my Situation's
[1:35:06] over even now Lord whatever you ask the
[1:35:10] father whatever you ask in my name
[1:35:15] believing but that's the key is not have
[1:35:19] an ounce of Doubt mixed in with but
[1:35:21] believing he said You shall have
[1:35:25] whatsoever you
[1:35:28] ask now brother Timothy tells a story
[1:35:30] and I'm going to repeat it for y'all
[1:35:32] tonight he there was a
[1:35:35] king and this King many people came to

[1:39:36] umbrella of the message that would begin
[1:39:38] to
[1:39:39] drift and it would take a parents'

[1:40:31] so we understand that in a game of
[1:40:34] chess there's one there's one figure one

[1:40:49] this one there's that one there's the
[1:40:50] queen I mean come on certainly the queen
[1:40:55] no what you see here is a chess board
[1:41:01] it's a game of strategy it's where you
[1:41:03] as a chess player try to manipulate your
[1:41:07] opponent into making
[1:41:09] moves that help you put that player's
[1:41:13] King see it's all about the
[1:41:16] king put the king in
[1:41:20] Checkmate and when their King has no
[1:41:23] more moves brother
[1:41:26] Tommy then you can put your chest out
[1:41:30] check
[1:41:32] me we would say it in English Today mik
[1:41:37] drop some of y'all get that
[1:41:43] tomorrow next
[1:41:45] slide I hope this comes up pretty
[1:41:48] good we're bringing it to a close right
[1:41:50] here
[1:41:55] so this picture that we're about to look
[1:41:59] at this
[1:42:01] picture is a
[1:42:03] painting that was painted by a famous
[1:42:07] man by the name of Frederick Fredick RZ
[1:42:11] he's got several little names in there
[1:42:12] I'm not going to read all those but this
[1:42:14] painting
[1:42:16] once once was uh displayed in the Lou
[1:42:20] Museum in Paris
[1:42:21] France you look at this painting and
[1:42:24] this is a you can't really see all the
[1:42:26] detail of it if you look back in the
[1:42:27] back you can really see the detail so
[1:42:29] everybody turn around real quick and
[1:42:30] look at the back because this is a much
[1:42:32] better picture everybody see that stand
[1:42:35] up if you need to I'm okay I'll preach
[1:42:36] right here y'all stand up with me we're
[1:42:38] about to close stand on up and turn
[1:42:40] around look at that so we look at this
[1:42:42] painting here and we see that this King
[1:42:46] we find this man which is the devil here
[1:42:49] he's being portrayed as a devil and we
[1:42:52] find the lion here on the far left he
[1:42:54] has his paw on the skull of another uh
[1:42:58] maybe a previous victim then you see
[1:43:00] this Red Feather which is an emblem an
[1:43:02] ancient emblem of cunningness and Malice
[1:43:04] and we find that this this King he seems
[1:43:08] for lawn and the angel in the back is
[1:43:10] looking at them because this painting is
[1:43:13] called
[1:43:15] Checkmate and we look at this and we
[1:43:17] find here that Satan appears to have so
[1:43:19] many more pieces of the king's pieces
[1:43:23] and the King only has just a handful
[1:43:25] keep looking back there way that's okay
[1:43:26] I want you to focus on the painting so
[1:43:28] we see here there's an ancient legend
[1:43:30] that said that there came a Grandmaster
[1:43:33] chess Champlain into the Lou Museum one
[1:43:35] day he came through with a group and
[1:43:37] they looked at the Mona Lisa o they
[1:43:39] wound over it but next to the Mona Lisa
[1:43:42] hung this portrait or this painting and
[1:43:45] he stopped and he looked at it and he
[1:43:48] meditated on it and he studied it
[1:43:53] because we find here this chess board is
[1:43:56] placed on a coffin so what that's
[1:43:59] telling you that Satan and this King are
[1:44:03] playing for the king's
[1:44:05] Soul so young people you can't play with
[1:44:08] this message you can't play and
[1:44:11] gamble with this
[1:44:14] message cuz Satan is after your king and
[1:44:17] when he gets your king he gets you he
[1:44:21] gets your soul and we find here that we
[1:44:24] look at this and we see that he got this
[1:44:26] red rooster or this rooster feather in
[1:44:28] his cap and and his Wicked pieces the
[1:44:31] king's Wicked pieces he's his own self
[1:44:33] as the king his Queen is voluptuous
[1:44:36] female his offices of his devices are
[1:44:39] laziness anger Pride falsehood doubt and
[1:44:42] unbelief and the devil is in a winning
[1:44:44] position and everyone knows it and he's
[1:44:47] one of the lot of the king's pieces and
[1:44:49] the devil looks absolutely arrogant
[1:44:51] while the young king and the angel
[1:44:53] looking on look extremely anxious and
[1:44:57] distraught and bewildered and no doubt
[1:44:59] with his head in his hand like many of
[1:45:01] us he says how did I get in this
[1:45:06] condition I've lost it
[1:45:08] all there's no
[1:45:11] hope I have no other
[1:45:15] moves but see this is not just a game of
[1:45:18] chess
[1:45:20] church more importantly young people
[1:45:23] it's a game of
[1:45:25] life it's a game of life and every day
[1:45:29] Satan is making moves to try to get you
[1:45:32] to make moves they say that a good chess
[1:45:36] player can make one move ahead at a time
[1:45:39] one move he can think one move ahead at
[1:45:41] a time a great chess player can make
[1:45:44] four to five moves ahead at a time but a
[1:45:49] really great chess player can make 20
[1:45:52] moves ahead head at a time so Satan is
[1:45:56] all about making moves while you're
[1:45:59] streaming the internet scrolling through
[1:46:03] and he knows he can just show that click
[1:46:05] image and when you click there's 20
[1:46:08] other moves that he's going to do follow
[1:46:10] right behind it and see Satan also
[1:46:13] studies your weaknesses and a lot of
[1:46:15] times the opponent will make a move to
[1:46:19] exploit the weakness of his opponent
[1:46:24] he will make a move knowing that it's
[1:46:26] going to cost him but he's looking for
[1:46:29] weaknesses in his
[1:46:31] opponent and that's what Satan does he
[1:46:34] does things because he's looking for
[1:46:37] weaknesses well you say you're a
[1:46:39] Believer but you got this weakness and
[1:46:41] then he will exploit that
[1:46:43] weakness then he will turn that weakness
[1:46:46] into a habit then he would turn that
[1:46:49] habit into an addiction and if he can
[1:46:52] turn it into an addiction then he gets a
[1:46:54] stronghold in your
[1:46:56] life and he knows if he can ever gain a
[1:47:00] stronghold then it's next to impossible
[1:47:03] for you to defeat
[1:47:05] him let's carry on keep looking at the
[1:47:10] painting so the devil concentrates on
[1:47:12] our weakness and he thinks ahead and he
[1:47:15] begins to get you to make choice and
[1:47:17] sometimes you know we're human we make
[1:47:19] choices on our complexes we make choices
[1:47:21] on how we feel we make choices on you
[1:47:24] know if we're you know fear and worry
[1:47:25] and regret and you know then Satan will
[1:47:28] begin to blur the lines between right
[1:47:30] and
[1:47:31] wrong you know what used to be black and
[1:47:33] white areas he will mix those and now
[1:47:35] they're all gray things begin to come in
[1:47:37] your home that used to not come in your
[1:47:39] home music you listen to you used to not
[1:47:41] listen to movies come in your home that
[1:47:42] you used to would not
[1:47:46] watch see he begins to blur the lines
[1:47:49] but the only way to defeat s
[1:47:54] Satan the only way to defeat your
[1:47:58] adversary is by believing the
[1:48:01] truth so the facts may be stacked up
[1:48:03] against you tonight that yeah we are
[1:48:05] troubled on every side a lot of my
[1:48:07] pieces are gone but the truth is we're
[1:48:10] not in despair the fact is you may be
[1:48:13] perplexed tonight but the truth is
[1:48:15] you're not distressed the fact is we may
[1:48:17] be persecuted and feel the persecution
[1:48:20] but the truth is you're not forsaken the
[1:48:22] the facts may be that you've been cast
[1:48:24] down but the truth is you're not
[1:48:29] destroyed so the facts may be against
[1:48:31] you but the
[1:48:33] truth is on your side
[1:48:36] tonight so we get back to the painting
[1:48:38] and back to the legend of the story of
[1:48:40] this great
[1:48:42] Grandmaster studying what seems to be
[1:48:46] ours looking at this picture studying
[1:48:49] this painting looking at the pieces on
[1:48:52] the board
[1:48:54] see this spider at the bottom he's about
[1:48:57] to spin a web for his next
[1:49:00] victim
[1:49:01] my how did my family end up here my how
[1:49:08] did my marriage end up

[1:49:21] the message
[1:49:24] I've gone to meetings I've gone to
[1:49:26] camps but it seems like the further I go
[1:49:29] the more I lose and the more the devil
[1:49:32] takes and this Legend This grandmas he's
[1:49:37] studying brother Thomas he's studying
[1:49:38] this picture like you are right now and
[1:49:40] he's looking at
[1:49:43] it and he's studying it and all of a
[1:49:47] sudden he breaks the silence the know
[1:49:49] the Lou museum is a very quiet dignified
[1:49:52] place
[1:49:53] not a whole lot of talking going on kind
[1:49:55] of like a
[1:49:56] library and all of a sudden he said
[1:49:59] wait wait a
[1:50:02] minute he said it's not over
[1:50:06] yet what do you mean the curator runs
[1:50:09] over brother Thomas and he says it's not
[1:50:11] over yet the painting is wrong it's
[1:50:14] wrong it's wrong it's wrong it's not
[1:50:16] over yet the King has one more move oh

[1:50:46] children it may look like you're for
[1:50:48] long and
[1:50:49] gone but the king he said you're going
[1:50:53] to have to call the author you're going
[1:50:54] to have to call the one who painted us
[1:50:56] and tell him he needs to rename this
[1:50:58] painting because the King has one more
[1:51:05] move see Frederick Ric painted this
[1:51:09] painting sister Donna with the hidden
[1:51:12] Mystery
[1:51:13] inside he knew that one day there was
[1:51:17] going to come a
[1:51:19] Grandmaster and only Through The
[1:51:21] Grandmaster eyes cuz he read the board
[1:51:25] and look at the pieces that have been
[1:51:27] taken and the pieces that are
[1:51:31] remaining and what appears to be that
[1:51:34] the king is in
[1:51:35] Checkmate the next move was the devil in
[1:51:41] Checkmate and can I tell you there's
[1:51:44] been men who have studied this bride

[1:51:59] but God sent a grand champion God sent a
[1:52:02] messenger in this final age and he
[1:52:05] looked at the word and he looked at the
[1:52:07] people and he said the king our King
