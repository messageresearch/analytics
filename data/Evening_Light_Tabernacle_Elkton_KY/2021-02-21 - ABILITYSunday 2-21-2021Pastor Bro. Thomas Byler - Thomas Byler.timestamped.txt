[0:59] [Music]
[1:23] morning brothers and sisters
[1:26] if uh before we if
[1:29] you go ahead and stand with me please
[1:34] go ahead and be before we open in prayer
[1:37] go ahead and turn to
[1:38] ecclesiastes the seventh chapter
[1:45] i hope god's been good to you all this
[1:47] week
[1:49] that his blessings are abiding with you
[1:53] and i'll just open with the word of
[1:55] prayer
[1:59] whatever you have in need of this
[2:01] morning you know don't be afraid to ask
[2:03] for it don't be afraid to believe it
[2:05] whatever you need this morning god is
[2:06] more than able
[2:08] to meet your needs this morning we know
[2:11] that we want god to speak to us today
[2:13] through
[2:13] this service we don't want to go away
[2:16] empty we want to go away
[2:17] full so i'll just pray lord god we just
[2:21] come to your house lord with our hearts
[2:23] open lord
[2:23] with the desire to see you minister to
[2:25] the needs of your people lord
[2:27] that you speak to our hearts again of
[2:29] your word and your desire for us in this
[2:32] age that we live
[2:33] lord i pray that you'll bless your
[2:35] people each one hear the lord you know
[2:37] their needs
[2:38] you know it's not possible for human
[2:40] mind to know everything that's needful
[2:42] lord
[2:42] every day but we desire our lord and i
[2:45] desire that you'd bless these people
[2:47] lord be in their hearts and lives
[2:49] bless this service lord take full
[2:52] control over it lord his art
[2:54] is my prayer we just believe these
[2:56] things lord in your precious name
[2:58] amen and i'll start with the first verse
[3:01] here
[3:02] you know i i'm not gonna go but just
[3:05] remember that the word of god is a
[3:08] powerful thing
[3:09] as we speak it you know it might not hit
[3:12] your heart but you never know it might
[3:14] hate
[3:14] someone else's heart might be the thing
[3:17] they need to hear
[3:18] this morning to make them victorious in
[3:20] the days ahead
[3:22] and i'll start with this first verse a
[3:24] good name is better than precious
[3:26] ointment
[3:27] and the day of death than the day of
[3:29] one's birth
[3:42] sorrow is better than laughter for by
[3:44] the sadness of the continents
[3:46] the heart is made better
[3:57] it is better to hear the rebuke of the
[3:59] wise than for a man to hear the song
[4:02] of fools
[4:12] surely oppression maketh a wise man mad
[4:15] and a gift destroy of the
[4:27] be heart hasty in thy spirit to be angry
[4:31] and angry for anger rested in the bosom
[4:34] of fools
[4:45] wisdom is good with an inheritance and
[4:48] by it there is profit to them that see
[4:50] the son
[4:52] for wisdom is defense and money is
[4:55] defense
[4:56] but the excellency of knowledge is that
[4:58] wisdom giveth life
[5:00] to them that have it amen i said the
[5:03] most important thing is the word of god
[5:05] has to abide in our hearts brother david

[39:20] the book of num
[39:21] the book of numbers and
[39:25] would it be okay if we take our time
[39:26] this morning amen we'll just take our
[39:28] time
[39:30] this morning because we just want to say
[39:32] what god wants us to say
[39:34] amen and i trust that it will be a
[39:35] blessing to you certainly i appreciate
[39:37] it brother brad's message last sunday
[39:39] i really like that that was really good
[39:41] amen praise god
[39:42] amen
[39:53] and this morning i want to talk to you
[39:55] on the subject
[39:56] of ability ability
[39:59] amen in numbers the 13th
[40:03] chapter and we'll begin with verse 26
[40:06] and they went
[40:07] and came to
[40:12] getting ahead of you there a little bit
[40:14] chapter 13
[40:19] verse 26 and they came
[40:22] and they went and came to moses and to
[40:25] aaron
[40:25] and to all the congregation of the
[40:28] children of israel
[40:29] unto the wilderness param to kadesh
[40:33] and brought back word unto them and unto
[40:36] all the congregation
[40:38] and showed them the fruit of the land
[40:40] and they told him and said we
[40:43] we came into the land wither doubt did
[40:45] send us
[40:46] and surely it floweth with milk and
[40:48] honey and this is the fruit thereof
[40:51] nevertheless the people be strong that
[40:53] dwell in the land
[40:54] and the cities are walled and very great
[40:57] and moreover we saw the children of
[40:59] enoch there
[41:00] and the amalekites dwelt in the land of
[41:02] the south and the hittites and the
[41:04] jebusites
[41:05] and the amorites dwell in the mountains
[41:08] and the canaanites dwelled by the sea
[41:10] and by the coast of jordan
[41:12] and caleb stealed the people before
[41:14] moses said let us go up at once
[41:17] and possess it for we are well able
[41:21] to overcome it but the man that went
[41:23] with
[41:24] up uh with him said we be not able to go
[41:28] up against the people for they are
[41:29] stronger than we
[41:31] and they brought up an evil report of
[41:33] the land which they
[41:34] had searched on the children of israel
[41:37] saying the land
[41:39] through which we have gone to search it
[41:40] it is a land that eateth up the
[41:42] inhabitants thereof
[41:44] and all the people that we saw in it
[41:47] are men of great stature and there were
[41:51] and there we saw the giants the sons of
[41:53] enoch
[41:54] which come of the giants and we were in
[41:57] our own
[41:58] sight as grasshoppers and so we were
[42:01] in their sight and all of the
[42:04] congregation lifted up their voice and
[42:05] cried and the people wept that night
[42:08] and all the children of israel murmured
[42:10] against moses and against aaron
[42:12] and all the people of the congregation
[42:14] said unto them would to god that we had
[42:16] died in the land of egypt
[42:18] or with the god that we had died in this
[42:20] wilderness and wherefore saith the lord
[42:23] hath the lord brought us into this land
[42:25] to fall by the sword
[42:26] that our wives and our children shall be
[42:29] pray
[42:30] were with not better that we should
[42:31] return to
[42:33] egypt amen
[42:36] amen and that's as far as we will go
[42:41] god bless the reading of the words you
[42:42] can be seated this morning
[42:45] so we see here there was two thoughts
[42:47] isn't that right two ideas one of them
[42:50] was
[42:50] when caleb began to hear all this he
[42:53] heard a lot of
[42:54] negative thoughts a lot of negative
[42:57] words
[42:58] am i right they're stronger than we are
[43:01] these guys
[43:02] are giants they're huge people and
[43:04] they're inhabited everywhere
[43:06] everywhere you go by the seaside or
[43:09] whether you go to the south or whether
[43:10] he go to the north
[43:12] i mean these people are strong they're
[43:14] very armed they're very capable
[43:16] you know and he says we be not able
[43:20] so we want to take the thought of
[43:22] ability for a while amen because
[43:24] ability now
[43:27] we would if when we begin to think about
[43:29] ability it's
[43:30] the uh it's something that helps you to
[43:33] be able to actually get something
[43:35] done amen there's ability and then
[43:38] there's
[43:39] inability unable not able
[43:42] can't do it the difference between able
[43:45] to
[43:46] do it or you can't do it
[43:49] you're either able to do it or you're
[43:51] not able to do it amen
[43:55] so that's what we want to focus on this
[43:57] morning with the help of the lord
[44:00] and so we see this that
[44:04] especially here that
[44:07] when caleb saw it
[44:11] he said look let us go up at once let's
[44:14] go right away
[44:15] let's go do this he said we can do it
[44:20] we can do it we're able we're
[44:23] well able
[44:27] to do it more than
[44:30] able all right we're more than able to
[44:33] do this
[44:34] the other said we're not we can't you
[44:36] can't do it
[44:37] we can't do it nope can't do it and uh
[44:40] as we know
[44:41] the majority of them took the side of we
[44:44] can't do it
[44:48] now if i'm not wrong brother branham
[44:50] said that this was where
[44:51] israel made their last fatal
[44:55] decision that was the last time that god
[44:58] dealt with these guys right
[44:59] that was the last time that he was going
[45:02] to
[45:03] deliver them out of the hands of the
[45:05] enemy and and do a miracle for them and
[45:08] and so forth and then them for them to
[45:10] see the land
[45:11] it meant to be negative to such a point
[45:14] they had already come god had already
[45:17] brought him out of egypt he already
[45:19] supplied them food when they were hungry
[45:21] he already
[45:22] had the rock to bring water out he
[45:24] already fed a manna from heaven
[45:26] and opened the red sea and just i think
[45:29] it was
[45:30] either these 10 times the bible talks
[45:32] about these 10 times have i
[45:34] showed my power huh
[45:38] have i showed my ability to deliver them
[45:42] isn't that right
[45:43] amen and this was the last time this was
[45:46] the last time
[45:47] amen that they were going to disbelieve
[45:49] god isn't that right
[45:51] because the bible says over hebrew said
[45:52] he says they would not enter into israel
[45:55] because of what unbelief
[45:59] that's actually what kept them out of
[46:01] the promised land was their
[46:03] unbelief they never could get it through
[46:07] their heads hey
[46:08] you know look at the picture picture
[46:10] you're more than able to do it
[46:14] praise be to god
[46:18] amen so in this scenario here we want to
[46:20] take several scenarios here with the
[46:22] help of the lord we want to talk about
[46:23] daniel for a little bit also
[46:26] but you know in this scenario here god
[46:28] was basically fed up he was
[46:30] it was done let me tell you something uh
[46:34] even even when uh the
[46:37] pharisees and the children of israel
[46:39] whenever jesus was talking to them and
[46:41] they were talking about moses being
[46:43] their prophet and abraham is our father
[46:45] and so forth and
[46:46] our fathers eight will a man in the
[46:49] wilderness
[46:52] and when they were saying that the jesus
[46:55] if you remember
[46:56] jesus says and they are everyone
[47:00] dead
[47:06] our prophet taught us that what that
[47:08] meant was eternally separated from god
[47:12] is that right dead not sleeping or
[47:15] whatever but they were dead they were
[47:17] all dead
[47:18] amen that they were lost amen
[47:22] and we know that out of two million
[47:24] people there was only
[47:26] two people in that right out of that
[47:29] original bunch
[47:30] that made it into the promised land now
[47:33] we know that their children because
[47:35] after this god told them to go back out
[47:36] into the wilderness go back you know for
[47:38] 40 years they wondered
[47:41] hello they wandered until that old
[47:43] generation the old fighters
[47:45] the old doubters the old unbelievers all
[47:48] died off
[47:49] god says i'll take your children in your
[47:52] children go in because you say hey
[47:54] here we are gonna perish our children
[47:55] are gonna perish you know
[47:57] he says i'm gonna take your children but
[47:58] you're not gonna go in
[48:00] so joshua and caleb went in with their
[48:02] children and they were crossed over into
[48:04] the promised land
[48:05] but every one of them perished because
[48:08] they did not believe that they had
[48:10] the ability to do it with god
[48:16] i don't know about you but at whatever
[48:18] it is that you do
[48:20] you either can do it or you cannot do it
[48:24] and that right is one or the other and
[48:26] if you can do it there's
[48:28] that ability or the equipment and then
[48:31] to be able to get the job done
[48:34] we all know that half of any kind of a
[48:36] job is having the right equipment to do
[48:39] it
[48:40] praise be to god and you know there was
[48:43] a time there was a time
[48:44] all the way up until acts 2 38 all the
[48:47] way until there was a time when man
[48:50] amen it was very hard for them to
[48:52] overcome sin
[48:54] overcome unbelief overcome the lusts of
[48:56] the flesh
[48:58] is that right because they didn't have
[49:00] the means to be able to do it
[49:02] they would come and they make sacrifices
[49:04] to god and kill the sheep and the lambs
[49:06] and so forth
[49:06] every year but they would still go out
[49:08] there with the same desire that they had
[49:10] before
[49:12] they'd have to come the next year maybe
[49:14] maybe around december or whatever what
[49:16] time every day
[49:17] would come amen they would have done the
[49:19] same thing again they did the year
[49:21] before
[49:24] they they absolutely did not have the
[49:26] ability to overcome
[49:29] amen praise the lord
[49:32] all right let me uh read you a quote
[49:36] from the prophet now
[49:37] amen amen
[49:40] it's what was the holy ghost given for
[49:43] and he talks about moses
[49:45] when moses was called by god he says he
[49:49] was
[49:50] a total complete prophet
[49:53] and here's the segment i want you to
[49:55] listen to when god sends a man to do
[49:58] anything
[49:59] he completely equips him with everything
[50:03] that he has
[50:04] needed
[50:07] praise be to god y'all see your seat
[50:10] don't get too happy now
[50:12] but think about it if god ever sends a
[50:14] man if he gets you to do
[50:15] something he's not going to send you
[50:18] half
[50:19] ready half equipment he's going to give
[50:22] you
[50:22] everything that you have needed to get
[50:26] the job done
[50:32] praise be to god aren't you happy for
[50:34] that this morning in other words she's
[50:36] gonna make you
[50:37] able amen
[50:40] not unable he didn't bring them up here
[50:44] to kadesh barnea
[50:46] and to make them believe they can't do
[50:48] it that was not what god had intended
[50:50] whatsoever
[50:51] it so displeased god until basically
[50:54] they cross the line between mercy and
[50:56] judgment
[50:58] when you cross that line you can never
[51:00] go back again it's like blasphemy the
[51:02] holy ghost it's over with god's son
[51:05] hello amen so i like that
[51:09] notice he equips him completely equips
[51:13] him
[51:14] with everything that he has need of and
[51:16] if god calls a man
[51:17] to be a preacher he puts something in
[51:20] him
[51:21] to preach with
[51:25] amen if he calls him to be a teacher he
[51:28] put something
[51:29] in him to teach with amen if he calls
[51:33] him to be a prophet he'll pull
[51:35] something in him to be able to see
[51:36] visions
[51:38] amen how many knows that brother branham
[51:40] even explained to us that when god
[51:42] builds a prophet
[51:43] amen he puts his conscience and his
[51:45] subconscious
[51:46] so close together that he can actually
[51:49] see a dream
[51:50] while he's wide awake
[51:53] well i call it a dream but it's actually
[51:55] a vision
[51:56] because how many of us will have a dream
[51:58] and we'll remember just
[52:00] very vividly what it is i had one the
[52:01] other day very vivid dream
[52:04] amen of the house and uh just everything
[52:07] i ain't going to get into that but
[52:08] anyway
[52:09] and i can tell you the full details of
[52:10] it all but the prophet even he is
[52:13] he brings it so close together that he
[52:15] gives him that ability not everybody has
[52:17] that ability
[52:19] but he equips him praise be to god and i
[52:22] got to thinking about that that doesn't
[52:24] apply
[52:24] just to a prophet or a teacher i believe
[52:27] that applies to
[52:29] every one of us if he calls you to be a
[52:31] son
[52:32] or a daughter of god he will equip with
[52:34] you with the power
[52:36] to be able to be a son and daughter of
[52:39] god
[52:41] one of the things i want to bring out to
[52:42] this morning it's going to be one of the
[52:45] punch lines of the whole message of what
[52:47] i felt like the holy spirit brought to
[52:48] my attention and i want to bring to us
[52:50] the reason why
[52:54] we are not able
[52:59] the reason why that we are not able
[53:02] to do it amen
[53:06] how many like to know why i can't do
[53:07] this why why can't i do this
[53:11] in other words whatever it is that you
[53:12] need to overcome or whatever you need
[53:27] because in ephesians 3

[1:01:02] something else i want to talk to you
[1:01:03] about with the help of the lord this
[1:01:05] morning for a while
[1:01:06] and that is that our christian walk with
[1:01:08] the lord
[1:01:10] it isn't over with when you get born
[1:01:12] again
[1:01:16] your fight with unbelief
[1:01:21] your fight with your flesh and lust
[1:01:24] temptation wrong thoughts
[1:01:28] wrong deeds even that isn't over with
[1:01:31] it's a growing process
[1:01:36] oh god saved abraham he says i have made
[1:01:40] the father of nations
[1:01:42] ah he believed god
[1:01:45] and it was imputed unto him he was saved
[1:01:50] but he still took lot with him he stood
[1:01:53] till his father with him he still had a
[1:01:57] lot of turmoil
[1:01:59] he still had a bigger and fuss and
[1:02:01] fighting on the backside of the dead
[1:02:03] he still took a lot of unbelief
[1:02:04] unbelievable process
[1:02:07] huh that's the way it is with our life
[1:02:11] oh we feel the sweetness of the holy
[1:02:13] ghost come down and forgive us of our
[1:02:15] sin we think oh
[1:02:16] it's going to be heaven from here on out
[1:02:21] hello first thing we know we go down
[1:02:25] into one of them he white
[1:02:27] valleys the jebusite seasides
[1:02:30] we get the blues and we wonder if we
[1:02:33] ever was saved
[1:02:36] am i really a son come on folks
[1:02:40] all this comes in and that comes in
[1:02:42] trials comes why does this still bother
[1:02:44] me
[1:02:46] god's working on us i believe he's
[1:02:49] working on
[1:02:50] us until the fullness of christ
[1:02:53] is in us because a baby has a pre-born
[1:02:57] it has to learn to walk it has to grow
[1:02:59] up into its teenage years
[1:03:01] it has to go up until it becomes a full
[1:03:04] stature
[1:03:05] of a man or a woman
[1:03:08] and that's the way it is with us it was
[1:03:11] with the way with abraham it was the way
[1:03:12] it was with israel
[1:03:15] but you know the problem with israel is
[1:03:16] the neighbor would grow
[1:03:18] grow huh because how many knows after

[1:03:36] getting up in his armpits and biting it
[1:03:40] just get your people and get out of here
[1:03:45] huh i would too wouldn't you that's
[1:03:48] right he can make him so miserable
[1:03:50] god made him so miserable he said just
[1:03:51] take your people and go i had enough
[1:03:54] i mean all the children of israel but
[1:03:57] they did

[1:08:27] religious liberty away

[1:08:31] supposed to do that
[1:08:33] you ought to be saying god hey praise
[1:08:35] the lord we're rounding this thing down
[1:08:37] finally
[1:08:39] huh that's right it's supposed to go
[1:08:41] that way well there's only one thing
[1:08:43] left for america and that is
[1:08:45] the fire of god to come and to burn it
[1:08:47] up
[1:08:48] it's the only hope for this world praise
[1:08:51] be to god

[1:09:00] let this happen don't let that
[1:09:02] you're going for real disappointment
[1:09:06] it's supposed to happen it's supposed to
[1:09:08] get worse and we're seeing the
[1:09:09] multiplication of it isn't that right
[1:09:12] amen if you remember in daniel's time
[1:09:15] they manipulated the laws isn't that
[1:09:18] right to where
[1:09:19] it became illegal for him to worship his
[1:09:22] god
[1:09:22] that's what's happening around us they
[1:09:24] want to make it illegal for us to
[1:09:26] worship our god
[1:09:28] boy i'll tell you what you preach
[1:09:29] against homosexuality we'll shut you
[1:09:31] down go ahead and shut me down
[1:09:34] because i'ma preach against
[1:09:35] homosexuality against me
[1:09:37] against lesbianism against the
[1:09:40] government
[1:09:41] against everything that's ungodly that's
[1:09:43] my right as a
[1:09:44] prophet as a messenger of god
[1:09:48] boy i'll tell you what we do killed 68
[1:09:50] million of us before
[1:09:52] you might want to try to do it again i
[1:09:53] don't know but one thing's for sure
[1:09:56] there's a higher authority than the laws
[1:09:58] of the land
[1:10:00] that's the law of god but then
[1:10:02] manipulate it to where it would get
[1:10:04] daniel in trouble
[1:10:05] isn't that right and he got daniel in
[1:10:08] trouble and got him phoned in the lines
[1:10:09] then
[1:10:12] what did the king say the next morning
[1:10:14] he liked daniel
[1:10:15] and he had hated that that had happened
[1:10:17] he went out there
[1:10:19] and what did he say daniel
[1:10:22] the god that you serve every day and all
[1:10:24] the time
[1:10:25] that's the problem sometimes is we don't
[1:10:27] serve god all the time like daniel
[1:10:30] did i believe he's got to be a constant
[1:10:33] serving of the lord jesus christ
[1:10:35] every day every minute a day every
[1:10:37] breath you breathe
[1:10:39] it needs to be the lord huh
[1:10:44] and the king said daniel was your god
[1:10:48] able to save you
[1:10:52] from the lion's mouth
[1:10:56] hallelujah then you said yeah king he is
[1:11:00] more than able
[1:11:01] how many know we serve a god that is
[1:11:03] able more than able
[1:11:05] to take care of any problems that you
[1:11:07] have just allow your needs
[1:11:10] to give you a revival in your heart
[1:11:13] to revive that to reach how many needs
[1:11:16] are reused returning of your youth
[1:11:18] just like you once loved the lord and
[1:11:20] served god with all your heart
[1:11:22] you got away from that perhaps hello
[1:11:26] can you hear the spirit speaking to you
[1:11:28] you've gotten away from me but you can
[1:11:30] come back
[1:11:32] you're able i made the means
[1:11:35] i supplied the means amen
[1:11:41] praise be god yes he's able amen
[1:11:45] just like tasha and the cable we're more
[1:11:47] than able to take it
[1:11:51] oh mine i want to tell you something
[1:11:53] whatever the laws of the land become
[1:11:54] whatever we
[1:11:55] face in our future how many knows our
[1:11:57] god is able
[1:11:59] not only is he able but you are able
[1:12:04] we're more than able to face whatever
[1:12:07] comes our way and if god ever called you
[1:12:09] to be a christian
[1:12:12] if he called you think about it
[1:12:18] i've always wondered what it would have
[1:12:19] been like to have been born in the
[1:12:21] middle
[1:12:22] ages back in the 1500s 1400s
[1:12:25] you know gladiators and swords and
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:30] all this stuff but it was a catholic
[1:12:33] rule how many knows for a thousand years
[1:12:35] the catholics ruled
[1:12:37] and anybody disagreed with them went to
[1:12:39] the state got burnt
[1:12:41] went into the gladiators den
[1:12:44] hello fed the lions and all these other
[1:12:46] things gave their life for the gospel
[1:12:49] amen but i wasn't born back then you
[1:12:52] wasn't born back then
[1:12:54] why god has chosen you
[1:12:57] to live now and if he chose you to live
[1:13:00] now
[1:13:01] and he has called you in your heart to
[1:13:02] be a christian now i believe he's going
[1:13:04] to be equipping you
[1:13:06] to overcome this laodicea age this lay
[1:13:09] odyssey age
[1:13:10] oh my back then they didn't have hardly
[1:13:12] anything when i think about
[1:13:13] me 1920s when we had that
[1:13:17] stock market crashing everybody had to
[1:13:19] go out they made it take corn
[1:13:20] and feed it on the railroad tracks and
[1:13:22] eat that corn and they would
[1:13:24] oh people starving people one job people
[1:13:26] wouldn't work
[1:13:28] huh but yet that revival look at the
[1:13:30] revival that we had people
[1:13:32] come to god people pray now we've got
[1:13:34] everything
[1:13:35] the devil has given us every little
[1:13:37] delicacy everything
[1:13:38] ain't meant to take your time aiming to
[1:13:40] rob you of what god really has for you
[1:13:44] make you so busy with getting things and
[1:13:46] having things and having things nicer
[1:13:49] so you can't say amen in church you
[1:13:50] can't say hallelujah
[1:13:52] amen maybe oh my even brother bob says
[1:13:56] you know good times enable life of ease
[1:13:58] has never been good for the christian
[1:14:00] it makes him soft and doty a little bit
[1:14:03] of persecution
[1:14:05] that's always been good for the church
[1:14:08] hard times hard times will make you a
[1:14:12] lot better person than good times will
[1:14:17] oh yeah it's your will if what's most
[1:14:20] why do you think god allows trials to
[1:14:23] come your way
[1:14:24] i mean not another fifty thousand
[1:14:26] dollars
[1:14:27] not another hundred thousand dollars but
[1:14:29] trials things that make you
[1:14:31] sweat a little i mean that's what males
[1:14:33] character in you
[1:14:34] it's what make mole's character in us he
[1:14:37] could have made this world all a life of
[1:14:39] ease but he didn't make it that way
[1:14:42] all around his death all around his
[1:14:44] sickness all around his
[1:14:45] oh my it's just horrible
[1:14:49] amen but in the midst of all of this
[1:14:51] prosperity
[1:14:52] in the midst of all this getting and all
[1:14:54] of these goods that we have
[1:14:55] i believe the bride of jesus christ is
[1:14:57] going to keep her eye
[1:14:59] on the word of god amen we care about
[1:15:02] what we have here we care about whether
[1:15:04] we go to heaven
[1:15:06] even when there's holiness and
[1:15:07] righteousness and purity
[1:15:10] we care about how we're going to look
[1:15:11] when he comes
[1:15:13] whether we'll be accepted of him or not
[1:15:16] because that's what's important folks
[1:15:18] the coming of the lord
[1:15:23] amen praise the lord god is good
[1:15:26] amen this is another reason i really
[1:15:27] wanted to have this service this morning
[1:15:29] because i had something on my heart
[1:15:30] i'll tell everybody come lord give me a
[1:15:32] good message come on
[1:15:34] come on to church let's have church amen
[1:15:38] praise the lord it's not a rebuke not
[1:15:40] against anybody but
[1:15:41] amen i hope people was not sled riding
[1:15:43] yesterday but they can't make it to
[1:15:45] church today
[1:15:49] i think somebody needs to die a little
[1:15:51] folks
[1:15:52] we can do a lot of stuff on saturday but
[1:15:54] we can make it to the house of god come
[1:15:56] on folks where's your love at
[1:15:59] gotten a little bit of that layout to
[1:16:00] see it rubbing off on you
[1:16:02] amen lukewarmness amen praise be to god
[1:16:07] all right oh god is good isn't he
[1:16:12] oh so let's listen to this here we go
[1:16:15] all right let's go to
[1:16:16] part number two part number two on why
[1:16:19] why it is that so many times we can't
[1:16:26] all right then just like you
[1:16:31] says if you're a christian now god don't
[1:16:34] make halfway christians
[1:16:36] he makes complete christians
[1:16:41] god don't make any halfway preachers
[1:16:44] but the preacher can be halfway
[1:16:48] folks how many knows that that's the
[1:16:50] truth so many christians are about half
[1:16:52] christian
[1:16:54] half the time a little bit
[1:16:57] kinda what makes you that way what makes
[1:17:00] it that way
[1:17:02] i don't make it that way amen
[1:17:05] let me stop for just a second if i can
[1:17:07] find it let's talk about the preacher
[1:17:10] first of all if he makes a preacher
[1:17:13] brother ben says you know if he makes a
[1:17:14] preacher he'll give you something to be
[1:17:16] able to preach with
[1:17:22] in he romans let me see if i've got this
[1:17:26] rope down here
[1:17:27] so i brought my pen along so i could
[1:17:28] hebrews one
[1:17:31] write these things down so i don't
[1:17:33] confuse myself
[1:17:45] hebrews 1 and 7.
[1:17:57] now notice
[1:18:01] verse seven and of the angel he saith
[1:18:05] who maketh his angels spirits
[1:18:08] as angels or messengers or ministers
[1:18:12] and he makes his ministers a
[1:18:15] flame of fire
[1:18:19] so if a preacher is called to preach he
[1:18:22] makes him
[1:18:23] a flame of fire and no wonder
[1:18:27] whoever wherever he come from way back i
[1:18:30] guess
[1:18:30] minister of many years ago that become
[1:18:33] that said this
[1:18:34] he says you know why did the people want
[1:18:36] to come and hear you
[1:18:38] why did they come out to hear you
[1:18:41] what oh he said they come out to hear me
[1:18:44] because
[1:18:44] i just what i do is i set myself on fire
[1:18:48] and the people watch me burn many things
[1:18:54] that's the word all the work
[1:18:55] that's the way that a christian is
[1:18:57] that's the way that every one of us that
[1:18:59] has the holy ghost
[1:19:00] amen he gives you a flame of fire a
[1:19:03] liquifier
[1:19:04] in your heart the people watch you burn
[1:19:08] and they say well i want what he's got
[1:19:12] i'll never never forget when i brought
[1:19:14] the message to moani and mose and my
[1:19:16] brother's up there
[1:19:17] that was the words that moani said he
[1:19:18] says you know i don't know just what you
[1:19:19] got
[1:19:20] but whatever it is you got i want it
[1:19:24] huh how many please that should be the
[1:19:26] testimony of every christian
[1:19:28] your neighbors your wife
[1:19:34] should be able to see christ in you
[1:19:37] i backed my truck down this morning my
[1:19:39] wife's back's much better
[1:19:41] but she's still you know a little bit
[1:19:42] hurting a little bit and so and but i
[1:19:44] backed my truck down and
[1:19:46] it was snowy and slick i always parked
[1:19:48] my truck down and
[1:19:49] wait for my wife to lock the house up
[1:19:51] bring her person everything out there
[1:19:52] i had told her to bring a cup of coffee
[1:19:54] with her you know and i was sitting
[1:19:55] there and i watched her
[1:19:57] trying to hold a cup of coffee lock the
[1:20:00] door
[1:20:00] and someone said you know a gentleman
[1:20:02] would get out and open the door for a
[1:20:04] helper
[1:20:06] i got myself out of that truck you know
[1:20:09] come over around that slick spot that
[1:20:11] says here let me have that coffin let me
[1:20:12] have him first open the door
[1:20:14] help her in and help that says honey
[1:20:17] holy spirit just told me a gentleman
[1:20:18] come out here
[1:20:19] and he said well she said well i am
[1:20:21] certainly glad thank you very much you
[1:20:23] pulled the door forward you know
[1:20:25] that says i'm enough of that i said not
[1:20:27] just a rude rude you know i said i've
[1:20:30] had enough of the others by the time i
[1:20:31] do a little bit something to try
[1:20:34] amen so that's what the holy spirit will
[1:20:36] help you to be a gentleman and that
[1:20:38] right that's what the holy ghost does
[1:20:40] it tells you what you ought to not do
[1:20:43] amen
[1:20:43] sure but anyway so for whoever needed
[1:20:47] that you brothers maybe amen
[1:20:49] don't forget to open their door and shut
[1:20:51] it and help her out help one another out
[1:20:54] now where we're at that's why i believe
[1:20:57] that's for every christian
[1:20:59] make a flame of fire put something in
[1:21:02] here now how many knows that
[1:21:04] truly the bottom line of it all that the
[1:21:07] equipment that we need
[1:21:09] is the holy spirit that is
[1:21:12] what you need to be equipped with
[1:21:15] because without that it doesn't matter
[1:21:16] how much you try
[1:21:17] what you do you're not going to be able
[1:21:21] oh i try and i try and i try yeah it's
[1:21:24] always you
[1:21:24] trying you're going to fail
[1:21:28] but if it's him trying it's a whole
[1:21:30] different story
[1:21:33] amen that's where it comes in where paul
[1:21:36] says
[1:21:36] i know how to abound i know how to have
[1:21:39] all i need and i know how to suffer need
[1:21:42] i know how to be full and not how to be
[1:21:44] empty i can do all things through christ
[1:21:47] but strengtheneth me
[1:21:50] and the secret was in galatians i
[1:21:53] believe it is
[1:21:54] this is the secret as we go into this
[1:21:58] paul says you know i am crucified with
[1:22:00] christ
[1:22:01] he says nevertheless i live
[1:22:05] in other words paul said i am leaving
[1:22:07] but yet
[1:22:08] it's not me
[1:22:12] yet it's not me but
[1:22:15] christ liveth in me
[1:22:18] and the life that i now live i live
[1:22:22] in the flesh i live by the faith of the
[1:22:24] son of god
[1:22:26] and that in there greater is he that is
[1:22:29] in me
[1:22:30] than he that is in the world he that is
[1:22:33] in the world can overcome nothing
[1:22:35] but he that is in me he will overcome
[1:22:39] hallelujah oh my
[1:22:44] so i wrote down here my notes so why
[1:22:49] can we not overcome why can't we have
[1:22:52] victory
[1:22:54] why do we have this cantor
[1:22:58] amen the random used the phrase
[1:23:01] might be kind of poor english but it's
[1:23:03] still i like the phrase he said talks
[1:23:05] about a cantor
[1:23:07] and he can her amen
[1:23:11] praise the lord let's talk about that
[1:23:14] for just a minute
[1:23:18] he says now some of you people walking
[1:23:20] along and say well i
[1:23:21] just can't quit drinking i just can't
[1:23:25] quit this and that he says the holy
[1:23:28] spirit comes to live in you
[1:23:30] to make all these cats get away from you
[1:23:38] praise be to god oh no excuses
[1:23:42] make them quit tattling that's what it's
[1:23:45] for to make you live a holy life to
[1:23:47] follow god's instructions in the bible
[1:23:50] every time amen how many please that's
[1:23:54] what the holy gets you to do
[1:23:55] to follow it every time
[1:23:59] no excuses amen
[1:24:04] praise the lord
[1:24:12] all right so i wrote down here
[1:24:17] the reason that we still can't
[1:24:22] we don't have the joy that we should
[1:24:23] have we don't have the
[1:24:26] love of god like we should other things
[1:24:29] are just more important to us
[1:24:31] than god
[1:24:34] come on folks
[1:24:38] we ain't got no hallelujahs
[1:24:42] we ain't got no shouts in the church
[1:24:43] anymore we don't have no miracles
[1:24:46] happening
[1:24:48] we're moss back backslid
[1:24:52] not what we ought to be how many wants
[1:24:55] to know
[1:24:56] why
[1:24:59] all right and i believe it's found
[1:25:03] our answer is going to be found
[1:25:08] in luke and also
[1:25:11] in matthew
[1:25:14] let's start with luke
[1:25:19] the 14th chapter i don't know about you
[1:25:22] but i love it
[1:25:24] when there's a problem
[1:25:28] but i love it more when there's an
[1:25:31] answer to that problem
[1:25:32] [Applause]
[1:25:33] [Music]
[1:25:34] because if you didn't have an answer to
[1:25:35] that problem then you couldn't do it
[1:25:38] you would be unable
[1:25:42] to solve that problem
[1:25:46] so jesus said in luke 14 verse 28 i'm
[1:25:49] going to jump around here a little bit
[1:25:51] verse 28 he says now for which of you
[1:25:56] intending to build a tower
[1:26:00] sitteth not down first and counteth
[1:26:04] the cost amen
[1:26:08] whether he have sufficience to finish it
[1:26:13] all right in other words
[1:26:17] can you finish this project can you do
[1:26:20] this
[1:26:21] or can't you do it that's what he's
[1:26:23] asking you can you do it
[1:26:25] or can't you do it right
[1:26:28] at least happily after he had laid the
[1:26:31] foundation he
[1:26:32] is not able
[1:26:36] to finish it
[1:26:40] all that behold it begin to mock him
[1:26:44] saying this man began to build
[1:26:48] and was not able to finish it
[1:26:51] how many knows in ephesians 4 i believe
[1:26:53] it talks about how that god
[1:26:55] is building a tabernacle and we are that
[1:26:58] tabernacle that god is building
[1:27:00] amen that's right
[1:27:06] or what king going to make war against
[1:27:08] another king
[1:27:09] sitteth not down first and consult us
[1:27:12] whether he be able
[1:27:14] all right with ten thousand immediate
[1:27:16] uncommons against him with twenty
[1:27:18] thousand
[1:27:20] in other words anybody that's smart
[1:27:23] or wise wants to make sure that you're
[1:27:26] able to do it
[1:27:33] how do i put this
[1:27:37] i don't believe that i have met anybody
[1:27:39] that just loves to be a loser
[1:27:42] i just love to lose you know i love to
[1:27:45] fail every time
[1:27:47] huh we like to slow things down we like
[1:27:49] to say oh man
[1:27:51] you know if we fail it disturbs us when
[1:27:54] we fail we don't want to fail
[1:27:56] we want to get it done we want it to
[1:27:58] happen right that's what jesus
[1:28:00] is saying here you want to know whether
[1:28:02] you're able to do it or whether you're
[1:28:04] not able to do it
[1:28:06] all right or else while the other is yet
[1:28:10] a great way off he sendeth an ambassador
[1:28:14] and desirous conditions of peace
[1:28:17] in other words he's so smart
[1:28:21] that if he knows he's going to lose he's
[1:28:23] going to make peace somehow
[1:28:24] he's going to come out on top here
[1:28:26] somehow
[1:28:28] right now notice that jesus would
[1:28:31] actually take these
[1:28:32] two parables before saying this
[1:28:36] all right conditions of peace so
[1:28:38] likewise
[1:28:39] whosoever he be of you
[1:28:43] that forsaketh not all that he hath
[1:28:46] he cannot be my
[1:28:49] disciple
[1:28:54] wow and i wrote down here that the
[1:28:58] reason that we can't do it a lot of
[1:29:00] times is because
[1:29:02] we fail to sell everything
[1:29:08] now notice if you're not willing to
[1:29:11] forsake everything
[1:29:12] for christ then you're not going to be
[1:29:15] the kind of christian that you're
[1:29:16] supposed to be
[1:29:19] now i wanted to go back to the beginning
[1:29:23] in verse 26 of chapter 14 of luke
[1:29:27] if any man come after me well
[1:29:30] let me go this way let me go back a
[1:29:32] little bit he was just finished talking
[1:29:34] about the
[1:29:34] supper that he made many were bitten and
[1:29:37] a lot of made excuses and so forth
[1:29:39] and there went a great multitude with
[1:29:42] him
[1:29:43] and he turned and he said unto them so
[1:29:45] how many knows when jesus began to teach
[1:29:46] something you better listen
[1:29:48] a great multitude if any man come after
[1:29:51] me and hate not his father
[1:29:53] mother wife children brethren sisters ye
[1:29:57] and his life also
[1:30:03] huh isn't that something he knocks
[1:30:06] out your family how many knows we all
[1:30:10] know
[1:30:11] there's not supposed to be anything as
[1:30:13] thick as blood
[1:30:16] nobody loves you more sticks together
[1:30:18] more than blood but jesus wipes that all
[1:30:20] out
[1:30:22] if any of that is more important to you
[1:30:23] to me then you ain't gonna be able to
[1:30:25] walk with me
[1:30:26] you ain't gonna be the kind of christian
[1:30:27] i'm looking for
[1:30:32] huh and not only
[1:30:35] family but also your
[1:30:39] own life
[1:30:50] your ways
[1:30:53] your thinking
[1:30:56] your ambitions your goals
[1:31:01] your prosperity
[1:31:04] whatever it is hello it better not be
[1:31:08] more important
[1:31:09] in christ and be with christ
[1:31:14] but people can't even make it to church
[1:31:17] i'm scared for you see i'm your pastor
[1:31:19] if i see somebody slacking on church
[1:31:22] i'm i'm getting worried folks
[1:31:25] i hate dislike as much as we did but
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:28] to because of sickness but i believe
[1:31:30] church is important
[1:31:32] i believe you being at your post of duty
[1:31:34] is important
[1:31:35] it shows everybody of how much you love
[1:31:38] the lord or not
[1:31:41] hello now i notice your own life your
[1:31:43] own way people and that's why we still
[1:31:45] listen i got the quote for you but
[1:31:46] listen
[1:31:47] swiss that's right and whosoever does
[1:31:50] not
[1:31:50] bear his cross and come after me
[1:31:54] cannot be my disciple
[1:31:59] amen
[1:32:05] all right where is this i'm looking for
[1:32:09] a certain thing here
[1:32:13] all right here it is see
[1:32:17] sometimes and i truly believe this that
[1:32:20] the reason that we can't
[1:32:22] if there's still too much of our own
[1:32:24] life in there
[1:32:28] there's still some of us in there
[1:32:30] there's still some you
[1:32:33] that's living maybe it's your business
[1:32:36] life maybe it's your private life
[1:32:39] huh your life of pleasure
[1:32:43] your you time everything has to be
[1:32:47] covered
[1:32:48] by the blood god wants every part of you
[1:32:53] every day that you live you want to be
[1:32:56] able to say just like paul
[1:32:58] it's not me that's living here it's
[1:33:02] christ that's living in me
[1:33:05] see god makes his children christians
[1:33:09] but sometimes they're halfway christians
[1:33:11] but it's not god's intentions for them
[1:33:13] to be that way
[1:33:14] it's their own ways that get mixed up
[1:33:18] in the plan of god for their life that's
[1:33:20] why we find so many people can't do it
[1:33:24] amen that's what makes them the way
[1:33:27] that they are it takes a complete
[1:33:31] surrenderence to jesus christ
[1:33:36] last scripture i want to go to matthew
[1:33:48] 13.
[1:33:52] matthew 13 this has to do with selling
[1:33:57] all right matthew 13 and verse 44.
[1:34:01] again the kingdom of heaven is likened
[1:34:04] unto a
[1:34:04] treasure head in a field
[1:34:09] the which one a man hath found he hideth
[1:34:12] and for joy thereof goeth and
[1:34:16] self
[1:34:20] have you ever heard of being sold out
[1:34:22] how many sold out
[1:34:24] folk i am sold out
[1:34:32] and here's the problem for some of us
[1:34:35] probably it reads like this
[1:34:37] sell off some that he had
[1:34:41] a little did he have kind of like
[1:34:44] and
[1:34:49] hey we sold that land we sold
[1:34:52] five acres of land and we're giving the
[1:34:55] money to the church
[1:34:56] that's what they said we want to donate
[1:34:58] it to the church where he caused
[1:35:01] they come in there and gave it to him
[1:35:07] husband came gave it to him in that
[1:35:08] right says we're given this
[1:35:12] but they kept out a portion of it
[1:35:17] they kept out a portion of it
[1:35:21] and what did that make it a little white
[1:35:26] lie sure
[1:35:28] that's the land that's the money from
[1:35:29] the land but it's not all the money from
[1:35:31] the land
[1:35:34] and peter says why have you why has
[1:35:36] satan put in your heart
[1:35:38] to lie to the holy ghost
[1:35:45] amen see folks if people aren't honest
[1:35:48] with god
[1:35:50] they're probably not going to be honest
[1:35:53] amen think about it and it can be an
[1:35:56] honest neighbor
[1:35:58] that's right because you're dealing with
[1:36:00] god
[1:36:01] and then his wife also came in and said
[1:36:05] the same thing
[1:36:07] how many believes that if she said no no
[1:36:10] that's not right
[1:36:11] we only gave half we want to give half
[1:36:13] that's what we're given
[1:36:15] that lady would have lived she'd have
[1:36:18] stayed alive
[1:36:20] but she was like her husband i mean
[1:36:22] believes it's important to have a good
[1:36:24] husband to lead you right
[1:36:26] amen not on us not the full measure
[1:36:32] can we say that's how god feels when we
[1:36:35] only give him a certain portion of
[1:36:36] ourself
[1:36:38] he says you're not worthy to be called
[1:36:39] my disciple if you're not
[1:36:41] going to only have self has sell half
[1:36:43] out
[1:36:44] i want your all
[1:36:48] i want you mine i want your ambitions
[1:36:50] you goal
[1:36:52] everything about you your life
[1:36:56] well i tell you what i have certain
[1:36:57] things that i want to do and maybe he
[1:36:59] wants you to be a missionary
[1:37:01] maybe he wants you to be a preacher
[1:37:02] maybe he wants you to be an evangelist
[1:37:04] maybe he wants to do something for the
[1:37:05] kingdom of god huh
[1:37:08] think about it that's what you got to be
[1:37:10] willing to do if that's what god
[1:37:12] wants you to do i'll never forget when i
[1:37:15] come to the lord i says
[1:37:16] here i am lord whatever you want me to
[1:37:19] do i'll do it
[1:37:20] here i am i believe that's
[1:37:23] god honored that sacrifice he filled me
[1:37:25] with the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:37:27] i've been trying to do just what god
[1:37:29] wants me to do ever since oh and i
[1:37:31] failed many times in many things hello
[1:37:36] but i truly believe i'm in the will of
[1:37:37] god i believe we're in the will of god
[1:37:40] i believe this is the will of god
[1:37:43] amen and i still see things in my life
[1:37:47] little things little areas in my life
[1:37:51] where i could say you know
[1:37:52] you need to get that surrendered that's
[1:37:55] right
[1:37:57] you might not think it's much but it is
[1:38:00] just little thing all kinds of little
[1:38:02] things like this morning about
[1:38:04] being a gentleman or you know
[1:38:07] being neighborly and being kind and have
[1:38:10] affection and so forth for
[1:38:12] for one another and pray for one another
[1:38:17] amen and need more of the love of god
[1:38:20] to share the gospel with my neighbors
[1:38:23] with those who i work with
[1:38:24] those around you there's only one going
[1:38:27] to be one treasure in heaven that's
[1:38:28] those whom you've
[1:38:29] won to the lord jesus christ those souls
[1:38:32] that'll be eternal
[1:38:34] amen so now those that's right he
[1:38:38] selleth
[1:38:38] all that he has because that's what it's
[1:38:40] going to cost you unless you're willing
[1:38:42] to give
[1:38:42] all that's right
[1:38:46] your feelings your emotions whatever it
[1:38:48] is it's got to be surrendered
[1:38:50] completely to god
[1:38:54] i believe with all of my heart that when
[1:38:57] you completely surrender to god
[1:38:59] and you don't you know that's exactly
[1:39:01] what god wanted israel to do
[1:39:03] when moses come down around them into
[1:39:06] that trap
[1:39:06] and there was nowhere to go anymore all
[1:39:10] god wanted to hear was look at what god
[1:39:13] did he's more than able to take care of
[1:39:15] our problem here
[1:39:17] i surrender my heart if hey if they come
[1:39:20] and kill me with the spear
[1:39:21] if that's god's will then let them kill
[1:39:24] me but i'm god's
[1:39:26] ain't no spear would ever got to them
[1:39:29] them oh my and they didn't god saved him
[1:39:33] despite their unbelief didn't he
[1:39:35] despite their unbelief he saved him all
[1:39:37] of those times
[1:39:38] delivered them all of those times
[1:39:40] because god is more than able
[1:39:43] amen praise the lord how many is glad to
[1:39:46] serve
[1:39:47] god that is able possible
[1:39:52] whatever we face in the future folks i'm
[1:39:55] telling you
[1:39:56] keep god in your heart i truly believe
[1:39:59] the holy spirit is calling
[1:40:01] both here and out there everyone to
[1:40:04] completely
[1:40:06] give themselves to him so that he might
[1:40:09] fill you
[1:40:10] with the fullness of christ and you'll
[1:40:13] be able to overcome whatever it is that
[1:40:15] you need to overcome
[1:40:18] and go through whatever you need to be
[1:40:20] able to go through
[1:40:21] because you're more than able because he
[1:40:23] is more than able
[1:40:28] in jude 1 and verse 24 jude he says now
[1:40:32] unto him
[1:40:33] that is able to keep you from falling
[1:40:37] amen and to present you
[1:40:40] fault lust before the presence of his
[1:40:43] glory with exceeding
[1:40:45] joy i truly believe that every eagle
[1:40:49] every son of god every predestinated
[1:40:51] child of god
[1:40:52] i mean there's something on the inside
[1:40:54] that god is working on
[1:40:56] and he is ultimately the one that is
[1:40:59] going to do it
[1:41:01] how many believes it but god has to take
[1:41:03] us through things and he's got to teach
[1:41:05] us all
[1:41:05] to surrender a little bit more and
[1:41:07] that's what we all come to church for
[1:41:09] this morning isn't it
[1:41:10] to get a little closer to the lord to
[1:41:12] walk a little closer with him and then
[1:41:14] it may be cold out there the world is
[1:41:17] black and dark and smart as as the
[1:41:20] bottom of the pits of hell out there
[1:41:22] this world is nothing but
[1:41:24] smut of hell it's horrible out there
[1:41:28] but in the midst of all of this he's got
[1:41:30] a shining light i mean people that are
[1:41:32] purified
[1:41:33] by the blood of jesus christ that asks
[1:41:36] for forgiveness of their sins
[1:41:37] they give themselves completely to god
[1:41:39] and say lord
[1:41:40] we're getting away from the world we're
[1:41:43] getting away from our own life
[1:41:44] every day a little closer to you lord
[1:41:47] surrendering more and more
[1:41:50] so that no matter what comes whether
[1:41:53] it's lions dens
[1:41:54] whether it's in uh daniels and the lion
[1:41:57] sense or whether it's
[1:41:59] fiery furnaces and folks i'm telling you
[1:42:02] right now you're in a
[1:42:03] fiery furnace of laodicea lukewarm
[1:42:08] mushy gushy jellyfish back boneless back
[1:42:11] no spine anymore and people
[1:42:15] hello just a bunch of gushing everything
[1:42:18] out
[1:42:18] but in the midst of it all he's bringing
[1:42:21] us together and forming some real
[1:42:23] strong amen christians that are going to
[1:42:25] meet the lord in the air and so shall we
[1:42:28] ever be with the lord
[1:42:29] why because we know he is our ability
[1:42:33] oh that's what little caleb
[1:42:37] could say we're more than able we're
[1:42:40] more than able
[1:42:41] how many this morning amen when you well
[1:42:44] first of all let's just check our hearts
[1:42:46] take eric check your hearts maybe
[1:42:49] everybody's perfect in here i hope you
[1:42:51] are
[1:42:52] i know i'm not but look at your heart
[1:42:55] say you know there's this area in my
[1:42:57] life that i really haven't surrendered
[1:42:58] yet like i need to
[1:43:00] and that's where my ways are getting
[1:43:02] mixed up
[1:43:04] that's why i'm not the christian that i
[1:43:06] should be i'm not a complete
[1:43:09] christian like i should be
[1:43:14] that's right i know my faults i know
[1:43:17] exactly what it is and i hate to think
[1:43:22] huh
[1:43:24] that's right i've already confessed it
[1:43:27] to you all a bunch of times but
[1:43:28] anyway just little things the devil try
[1:43:31] to
[1:43:32] slip you up you know no matter what it
[1:43:34] is
[1:43:36] but you know god looks at your heart he
[1:43:38] looks into your heart
[1:43:39] he looks at every one of our heart he
[1:43:40] knows just what it is
[1:43:44] i know where i'm slack and say god help
[1:43:45] me i want to surrender all to you lord
[1:43:49] you're more than able to help me to be
[1:43:52] what i
[1:43:52] i'm supposed to be more than able but it
[1:43:55] takes me
[1:43:57] saying god i'm this morning selling
[1:44:02] my life it's all yours i'm trading my
[1:44:04] life lord for yours
[1:44:08] here i am how many is with me this
[1:44:09] morning stand with me say lord here i am
[1:44:13] i'm selling my life lord i'm giving it
[1:44:15] all not just partially it's this little
[1:44:17] partial stuff
[1:44:18] that causes you not to be able
[1:44:22] to do the things that you know you
[1:44:24] should do
[1:44:26] that's the bottom line of the message
[1:44:28] this morning it's our own ways that get
[1:44:30] in the way
[1:44:31] is why we're not able
[1:44:34] like i said i don't know who just you
[1:44:36] know but you know
[1:44:38] you know who you are you know what it is
[1:44:40] in your life
[1:44:43] that you can't overcome that you just
[1:44:46] can't get past
[1:44:49] there's no magic wands it's
[1:44:52] simply a complete selling
[1:44:56] of yourself to almighty god if you want
[1:44:59] the holy ghost it takes you
[1:45:01] completely to repent of
[1:45:04] every wrong say god i stop i quit

[1:45:40] work this morning
