[40:32] you thank you
[40:36] musicians enjoyed the the the service
[40:38] last night brother Tommy that was the
[40:41] testimony was outstanding if you call it
[40:44] a testimony seemed a little bit like a a
[40:47] sermon going on there but uh I enjoyed
[40:50] it it was very good uh and then brother
[40:53] Thomas gets up behind him it's always
[40:55] it's always great to get up behind uh a
[40:57] brother that's taking his time and your
[40:59] time and uh you know but uh that was
[41:03] okay it was it was great the uh uh it
[41:05] was it was really really good I've been
[41:08] struggling I kept going back and forth
[41:10] on what am I what am I going to speak on
[41:12] what am I going to speak on and and uh
[41:15] you know I know we we joke about this
[41:18] you know as as ministers and things of
[41:20] you know just coming out to the pull pit
[41:22] still not even sure what I'm going to
[41:23] what I'm going to speak on and but it's
[41:26] a serious thing thing it's not something
[41:29] to be taken lightly I believe there's
[41:32] there's Souls at
[41:33] stake and as brother Tommy made a
[41:36] comment I I'm not here to play
[41:39] church I believe he sent me here I
[41:42] believe he ordained this moment before
[41:44] the foundation of the world for a reason
[41:48] and so it puts
[41:49] pressure to make sure you get out of
[41:51] your way his way and and not pick
[41:54] something wrong not get in front of him
[41:57] but just with brother Tommy started out
[42:01] and he was on this sermon and then he
[42:03] was on this sermon and then he was on
[42:04] this sermon on this sermon but he
[42:07] started targeting in on one and then
[42:10] when brother Thomas got
[42:12] up it was pretty clear what I was
[42:14] supposed to preach so just going to try
[42:16] to take the thought that they were going
[42:19] with and just keep going with it but uh
[42:24] you all pray for me as as we uh work
[42:26] through this and um we're going to start
[42:29] in uh Genesis
[42:31] 3:15 we're going to read about four
[42:33] scriptures here and then I'll let you
[42:35] sit
[42:36] down you know I was in um I think it's
[42:40] been about a month ago Sarah and I went
[42:42] to West Palm Beach and I don't know if
[42:45] you guys know brother Jack Duff or not
[42:47] but he's there in West Palm West Palm
[42:49] Beach and just a a really really good
[42:52] brother if you ever if you're ever down
[42:54] there make sure to stop in but a it's a
[42:58] it's a black church and uh so my when I
[43:03] travel to West Palm Beach I normally
[43:06] kind of amp the dressing up a little bit
[43:09] to try to keep up with my brothers from
[43:11] West Palm Beach I'm not toned down
[43:14] nearly as much there as I am here
[43:16] today and uh um but I mean those
[43:20] Brothers know how to dress you know so
[43:22] so uh as I'm there there's another
[43:24] brother there in Buon Beach that he had
[43:26] asked me to minister and I had only
[43:28] brought one outfit and uh it wasn't
[43:33] something that I would typically preach
[43:34] in but I walked into brother Jean's
[43:37] office there in Boon Beach and I told
[43:40] him I said brother I said I only brought
[43:42] one outfit I said I hope this is okay
[43:45] and I thought his answer was so perfect
[43:47] brother Thomas he looked at me he said I
[43:50] don't care how you're dressed I just
[43:52] want to hear the word and I hope that's
[43:55] what we're here today for not to show
[43:57] off the way that we're dressed or see
[43:59] how somebody else is dressed or hear
[44:01] from a
[44:01] man but to hear the word of God that's
[44:05] what I'm here
[44:06] for so Genesis
[44:09] 3:15 and I will put enity between thee
[44:13] and the woman and between thy seed and
[44:15] her seed and it shall bruise thy head
[44:19] and thou shalt bruise his
[44:21] heel this is one of my favorite
[44:24] scriptures it's showing
[44:27] that God before the foundation of the
[44:30] world knew that this fall was going to
[44:32] happen and he made a Plan of
[44:36] Redemption before it ever
[44:40] happened the world has just been created
[44:43] people have just been placed on the
[44:45] world the fall has just happened and yet
[44:48] he's talking about the one that's going
[44:51] to
[44:52] come to redeem
[44:55] us John 11 we're going to read
[45:13] 47-52 John 11:
[45:17] 47-52 then gathered the chief priests
[45:20] and the Pharisees a counsel and said
[45:22] what do we uh what do we for this man
[45:26] doth many miracles if we let him thus
[45:29] alone all men will believe on him and
[45:32] the Romans shall come and take away both
[45:34] our place and
[45:36] nation and one of them named Caiaphas
[45:39] being the high priest that same year
[45:42] said unto them ye know nothing at all
[45:45] nor consider that it is expedient for us
[45:48] that one man should die for the people
[45:52] and that the whole nation perish
[45:54] not and this spake he not of himself but
[45:58] being high priest that year he
[46:00] prophesied that Jesus should die for
[46:02] that nation and not for that Nation only
[46:06] but that also he should gather together
[46:09] in one the children of God that were
[46:11] scattered abroad that's
[46:14] us he didn't just die for them he died
[46:18] for
[46:19] us a a a god of today brother
[46:25] Thomas John
[46:39] 34-17 John 314- 17 and as Moses lifted
[46:44] up the serpent in the wilderness even so
[46:47] must the son of man be lifted up that
[46:49] whosoever believeth in him should not
[46:52] perish but have eternal life for God so
[46:56] loved the world that he gave his only
[46:58] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[47:01] him should not perish but have
[47:03] everlasting life for God sent not his
[47:07] son into the world to condemn the world
[47:10] not to condemn us but that the
[47:13] world the entire world not just us
[47:16] sitting here not the church down the
[47:19] street the entire world but that the
[47:24] world through him might be
[47:27] saved Matthew 18:14 last
[47:39] one Matthew
[47:42] 18:14 even so it is not the will of your
[47:46] father which is in heaven that one of
[47:50] these little ones should
[47:52] perish he doesn't want to see one of us
[47:56] one of anybody he doesn't want anybody
[47:59] to
[48:01] perish A Plan of Redemption for everyone
[48:05] that everyone in the world that would
[48:07] believe on him would have eternal
[48:11] life let's
[48:13] pray dear heavenly father
[48:16] Lord as I take this this simple thought
[48:19] Lord and just try to express it to your
[48:22] your children here father Lord I pray
[48:24] that that I would just move out of your
[48:27] way father and that you would just
[48:29] express your thought to them Lord Lord I
[48:34] pray that you would just take complete
[48:37] and total control of this service Lord
[48:39] take control of every spirit that would
[48:40] be in this building father Lord any
[48:43] doubt any any any anxieties any any
[48:47] anything that's not pleasing father that
[48:49] would hinder this service Lord I pray
[48:51] that you would just move it out of the
[48:52] way father Lord I pray that our thoughts
[48:54] and just everything about us would be
[48:56] centered around you right here right now
[48:59] Lord father I pray that you would just
[49:01] be with me just speak through me Father
[49:04] we love you with all of our hearts Lord
[49:06] in Jesus name I pray amen you can be
[49:09] seated thank
[49:11] you you know I noticed last night as we
[49:17] had uh what seemed to be some people
[49:20] there that may not be sitting
[49:23] here this morning some people that had
[49:27] kind of gathered you know as as brother
[49:31] Tommy was was giving his uh his
[49:34] testimony there know people were
[49:37] listening and people always want to hear
[49:40] you know what the Lord has done for
[49:42] somebody but when brother Thomas got up
[49:45] and he started preaching the
[49:47] word all of a sudden the place started
[49:49] emptying
[49:51] out you know these are people of the
[49:55] world and through ignorants they started
[49:58] to
[49:59] leave because that's not what they want
[50:01] to hear they didn't want to hear what
[50:04] brother Thomas was warning them about
[50:07] they just wanted to hear the good things
[50:10] that God does for us that's what they
[50:12] wanted to
[50:13] hear but I want to as we sit in this
[50:16] church this
[50:17] morning I'm not preaching to the world
[50:20] this morning I'm preaching to message
[50:25] believers but is that good
[50:29] enough we're sitting here and as we go
[50:33] through this
[50:34] sermon I want you to keep in mind we're
[50:38] not the
[50:39] world we're message Believers and we're
[50:41] sitting in a message
[50:43] church but is it good
[50:46] enough the title of my sermon this
[50:48] morning is the heart of
[50:52] God and what I'm wanting to talk about
[50:56] here
[51:00] is what is the heart of
[51:02] God what does the heart of God look like
[51:05] what are the characteristics of the
[51:07] heart of
[51:09] god so let's identify First who who is
[51:13] the heart of
[51:15] God 1955 the unwelcomed Christ now I
[51:19] want to say something to you Jesus Took
[51:22] the lowest place of flunky Hallelujah
[51:25] that proves to me he was God he took the
[51:28] lowest place to wash feet now I'm
[51:30] dropping down a little bit to paragraph
[51:32] 72 here still talking about the same
[51:34] thing find out there ain't much good
[51:37] about us when you think of him becoming
[51:40] a footwash flunky the lowest there was
[51:44] he really in heart was the highest there
[51:46] was he was the heart of God and became
[51:50] the lowest paid footwash flunky so
[51:53] brother brandham is here saying he's
[51:55] saying Jesus Christ was the heart of God
[51:59] okay so now brother brandham also goes
[52:02] on to talk about how Jehovah in the Old
[52:06] Testament was Jesus Christ of the New
[52:09] Testament right okay I've got a quote
[52:12] here but we we'll just keep going with
[52:13] this you guys know where I'm talking
[52:15] about so where I'm going with this if if
[52:18] if if god Jehovah Christ Elohim these
[52:22] are all God right so the characteristic
[52:26] the heart of God is going to act the
[52:28] same in Genesis as he does in Revelation
[52:32] he's going to act the same in judges as
[52:35] he does in Matthew he's never going to
[52:38] change it doesn't matter what figure
[52:41] he's taken on who what body he is using
[52:44] the his heart is going to continually be
[52:47] the same Through the Ages same as it is
[52:50] today same as it will be
[52:53] tomorrow he doesn't change right
[52:59] so now that we've had that we've got
[53:01] this part
[53:03] established let's start talking about
[53:06] what are the characteristics of the
[53:09] heart of
[53:10] God and before I jump into
[53:13] that I'm going to tell you about a a a
[53:17] picture a painting that me and my wife
[53:19] got as a gift this isn't
[53:21] necessarily uh Inspire this sermon but
[53:24] as I looked at this painting it just
[53:26] went so well with it so I'm going to
[53:28] describe this painting to you okay and
[53:31] it's a painting that we got as a gift
[53:33] and it's from GH Africa okay and I'm GNA
[53:38] as if I'm standing behind the painting
[53:39] so you guys are looking at the front as
[53:42] you see this painting one of the th
[53:45] first things typically that pops out is
[53:47] the ark okay there's clouds in the
[53:52] sky the water the waves are crashing ing
[53:57] around
[53:58] everything crashing onto the ark
[54:01] crashing onto a mountain there's a bolt
[54:03] of lightning coming
[54:05] down over here there's a
[54:08] mountain the sky is really dark
[54:11] okay I've asked several people because I
[54:15] knew when I looked at this painting
[54:17] there was things that just popped out to
[54:19] me real
[54:20] quickly so I started checking to see if
[54:23] it was this just me or was this with
[54:27] with everybody so as I started showing
[54:29] this painting to people it's pretty
[54:32] evident that the same things that popped
[54:34] out to me were the same things that
[54:36] popped out to other people almost every
[54:38] single person saw the same thing almost
[54:42] exactly in the same order the first
[54:45] thing was the
[54:48] ark so let's look at this for a minute
[54:52] because the first thing that people see
[54:54] are the ark and I'm going to say that
[54:57] this is a characteristic of the heart of
[54:59] God is
[55:01] compassion okay there's an arc here
[55:05] because of his
[55:07] compassion for his
[55:10] creation he did not want to lose a one
[55:14] and I'm got a lot of scripture here that
[55:17] I'm just going to kind of maybe I'll
[55:19] read it all maybe I won't I'm going to
[55:21] throw out the the the scriptures if you
[55:23] guys want to write it down and go back
[55:24] and read it later that that's great
[55:27] Genesis 6 uh 613 and 14 and God said
[55:30] unto Noah the end of All Flesh is come
[55:33] before me for the Earth is filled with
[55:35] violence through them and behold I will
[55:37] destroy them with the Earth he asked him
[55:40] to make an
[55:42] ark so because of his compassion for the
[55:46] human race because of his compassion he
[55:49] was providing a way of
[55:51] Escape okay because he cares for us he
[55:55] cares for his
[55:58] creation going right back to Genesis
[56:00] 3:15 before the foundation of the world
[56:03] because of his compassion he was already
[56:07] making a Plan of Redemption knowing that
[56:09] we were going to fall knowing that we
[56:12] were going to have to have something to
[56:14] redeem us instead of in i he could have
[56:18] come down in the garden and said okay
[56:19] I'm just going to wipe these two out and
[56:21] I'm going to start over but because he
[56:24] had compassion
[56:26] he made a way to get back he because he
[56:31] loves them he loves us he doesn't want a
[56:35] one of us he doesn't want to lose one
[56:39] because of his
[56:40] compassion Matthew 14 14- 21 and Jesus
[56:44] went forth and saw a great multitude and
[56:47] was moved with compassion toward them
[56:50] and he healed their
[56:52] sick I'm not going to read this whole
[56:54] thing this is the the the five 5,000
[56:57] okay he's standing there with a group of
[56:59] it's more than 5,000 5,000 men that
[57:02] didn't count the women and the children
[57:03] I don't know that's a lot of
[57:06] people but because of his compassion
[57:08] they he was moved by his compassion he
[57:11] healed their
[57:12] sick can you imagine the prayer line
[57:15] that looked like over 5,000
[57:19] people and he prayed and healed their
[57:22] sick and then didn't stop there the
[57:25] discip come to him and say hey we're in
[57:27] a desert there's nothing to eat we need
[57:29] to send these people away but because of
[57:31] his compassion no don't send them away
[57:33] let's feed them the disciples are
[57:36] thinking are you kidding me we don't
[57:38] have enough food here to feed the 12 of
[57:40] us how are you going to feed over 5,000
[57:43] people but because of his compassion for
[57:45] the people bring it to me 12 baskets of
[57:49] food I believe it was that was left
[57:53] over but that's his compassion
[57:56] Luke 7 11
[57:59] 11-15 and it came to pass the day after
[58:03] that he went into a city called Nan and
[58:06] many of his disciples went with him and
[58:09] and much people now when he came nigh to
[58:12] the gate of the city behold there was a
[58:14] a dead man carried out the only son of
[58:16] his mother and she was a widow and much
[58:19] people of the city was with her and when
[58:21] the Lord saw her he had compassion on
[58:24] her and said unto her her weep not so
[58:28] he's walked into a
[58:31] city there's a funeral going
[58:35] on he doesn't know this this woman he
[58:39] doesn't know this person that's
[58:41] died but he sees the
[58:45] situation and he has compassion for her
[58:49] she's a widow she doesn't have a husband
[58:51] now she's lost her son I don't know if
[58:54] she had more kids it doesn't say but
[58:56] he had compassion for
[58:58] her and there was nothing that she did
[59:00] to deserve what he was about to do
[59:03] there's nothing that she could do to
[59:04] earn what he was about to do but he
[59:06] walks over and the Paul Bears just move
[59:08] out of his way and he raises a man up
[59:11] from the
[59:12] dead because of the compassion for that
[59:16] woman a
[59:18] woman a one lonely woman but
[59:23] that it didn't matter if it was five
[59:26] ,000 people or if it was one his
[59:29] compassion still
[59:32] stood so on
[59:35] compassion we've talked about the Plan
[59:37] of Redemption that he's made because
[59:39] he's compassionate he loves us he needed
[59:42] to find a way for us to get back
[59:45] something to redeem us
[59:47] back build a
[59:49] boat even after he'd seen how evil the
[59:52] world had gotten his compassion he did
[59:55] not want anything anyone to die so he
[59:57] laid it on a man's heart to build a boat
[1:00:00] so that as many would come was
[1:00:08] welcome when before the destruction of
[1:00:12] Sodom Abraham comes to him and he's
[1:00:15] asking
[1:00:17] him if I can find
[1:00:19] 50 you guys know the story he says find
[1:00:23] me 50 I'll save them all because of his
[1:00:27] compassion what about 40 30 20 if I can
[1:00:31] find 10 if you can find 10 people I will
[1:00:36] save the city I will not destroy them
[1:00:39] because of his
[1:00:42] compassion Christ in the Garden of
[1:00:45] Gethsemane brother brandham says that
[1:00:48] that that Jesus died more in Gethsemane
[1:00:50] than he did in
[1:00:52] Calvary why his compassion
[1:00:56] the even the thought when you go back
[1:00:59] take this cup from
[1:01:01] me I don't want to do what I know is
[1:01:04] coming believe brother Tommy touched on
[1:01:07] this last night I don't want to do this
[1:01:11] but in the same breath not my
[1:01:15] will but yours be
[1:01:18] done the
[1:01:21] compassion god Jehovah Christ doesn't
[1:01:23] matter Old Testament New Testament it's
[1:01:26] the Same Heart of
[1:01:30] God the second thing people see in this
[1:01:35] painting is the
[1:01:38] storm the clouds how dark they are the
[1:01:42] waves that are crashing on the ark
[1:01:45] there's a lightning bolt that's shooting
[1:01:47] out of the sky and a young man pointed
[1:01:49] out how it splits and goes around the
[1:01:50] ark it didn't hit the ark and I thought
[1:01:53] about this what was that
[1:01:57] another
[1:01:58] characteristic of the heart of God
[1:02:02] Mercy he's a merciful
[1:02:05] god he had a
[1:02:08] boat he he laid it upon the heart of a
[1:02:11] man to build a boat to save people that
[1:02:14] if you will get in this boat you will
[1:02:17] you will not uh you'll be safe from this
[1:02:20] storm that's coming because of his Mercy
[1:02:26] Genesis 6:5 to7 and God saw the
[1:02:28] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[1:02:32] and that every imagination of the
[1:02:34] thoughts of of his heart was only evil
[1:02:36] continually and it repented the Lord
[1:02:39] that he had made man on Earth and it
[1:02:41] grieved him at his heart it repented he
[1:02:43] regretted the fact that he even made man
[1:02:47] because he saw how evil they had
[1:02:51] become and yet through his Mercy he
[1:02:55] would was providing a way of
[1:02:58] Escape Genesis
[1:03:00] 18:32 and he said oh let not the Lord be
[1:03:04] angry and I will speak yet but this once
[1:03:07] peradventure 10 shall be found there and
[1:03:10] he said I will not destroy it if for
[1:03:12] 10's sake just we were talking about
[1:03:14] just a minute ago Abraham just pleading
[1:03:16] with the Lord don't destroy if you can
[1:03:19] find 10 because of my
[1:03:21] Mercy find 10 and I'll spare them all
[1:03:26] Luke 171 12-19 and he entered into a
[1:03:29] certain Village there met him 10 men
[1:03:33] that were leopards which which stood AAR
[1:03:36] off and they lifted up their voices and
[1:03:38] said Jesus Master have mercy on us we
[1:03:42] know this story 10
[1:03:45] leopards they come to him they're asking
[1:03:49] for
[1:03:51] Mercy all he does is tell them to go and
[1:03:54] show themselves to the to the
[1:03:56] priest he doesn't say you're healed he
[1:03:58] doesn't say anything he just says go
[1:03:59] show yourselves as they're walking away
[1:04:02] they realized they're clean they realize
[1:04:05] that they're healed because of his Mercy
[1:04:08] they asked for mercy and he provided
[1:04:11] Mercy one turned around and came back to
[1:04:16] him he asked
[1:04:18] him where are the other nine but show me
[1:04:22] in the Bible where it says that they the
[1:04:25] the Le lepry came back on
[1:04:28] him he still healed them because of his
[1:04:31] Mercy it didn't matter that they didn't
[1:04:33] come back and thank
[1:04:35] him they still remained healed because
[1:04:38] of his Mercy they asked for mercy and he
[1:04:41] provided
[1:04:42] Mercy Mark 10:46 to 52 and they came to
[1:04:47] Jericho and as he went out of Jericho
[1:04:50] with his disciples and a great number of
[1:04:52] people blind bmus the son of TUS Sat by
[1:04:56] the highway side begging and when he
[1:04:58] heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he
[1:05:00] began to cry out and say Jesus thou son
[1:05:02] of David have mercy on me and many
[1:05:05] charged him that he should hold his
[1:05:07] peace but he cried the more a great deal
[1:05:10] thou son of David have mercy on me again
[1:05:14] another person Jesus did not know this
[1:05:17] man he's walking through a city and this
[1:05:20] man starts screaming have mercy on me
[1:05:23] and because of the mercy of Jesus Christ
[1:05:26] the mercy of the heart of God he stopped
[1:05:30] and said bring him to me even though the
[1:05:33] crowd is telling him to be quiet no
[1:05:35] bring him here he's asking for mercy and
[1:05:38] I can provide that
[1:05:43] mercy so as we look at
[1:05:46] Mercy another attribute another
[1:05:48] characteristic of the heart of God even
[1:05:52] though he regretted making Men He Saw
[1:05:55] where the the the sons the sons of God
[1:05:59] see the daughters of of man and they
[1:06:01] they mingle with them even though they
[1:06:03] knew not to do that but they did it
[1:06:07] anyways but even with that he sends a
[1:06:11] man to preach for 120
[1:06:14] years about something that had never
[1:06:16] happened before what did he even
[1:06:20] say the what there was no word for this
[1:06:23] it never happened before how do you what
[1:06:25] how do you to people the the the sky
[1:06:27] it's going to start
[1:06:29] crying the water's going to start
[1:06:32] falling out of the
[1:06:33] sky these people are like what are you
[1:06:35] talking about there's did Noah make up
[1:06:38] 60 years in thinking okay I got to make
[1:06:40] up a word for this so now he starts
[1:06:42] preaching it's going to rain people and
[1:06:44] everybody's going I don't even know what
[1:06:45] that
[1:06:47] is but he preached for 120 years God had
[1:06:51] this man preach for 120 years because of
[1:06:54] his Mercy
[1:06:56] that anybody that would
[1:06:58] listen come into this
[1:07:00] Ark he sent two angels into
[1:07:03] Sodom just to see if they could find
[1:07:10] enough because he would spare it find
[1:07:13] 10 because of his
[1:07:18] Mercy he healed people time and time
[1:07:21] again whether they deserved it whether
[1:07:24] they didn't deserve it
[1:07:27] whether they thanked him or didn't thank
[1:07:30] him he would still heal them because
[1:07:33] they would ask for mercy and he could
[1:07:35] provide Mercy for them I needed Mercy
[1:07:39] brother Tommy if you listen to his
[1:07:40] testimony he needed Mercy we all at some
[1:07:44] point in our lives needed Mercy I would
[1:07:45] be a divorced man not standing here
[1:07:48] before you today if it was not for the
[1:07:51] mercy of the heart of God
[1:07:55] [Applause]
[1:08:04] the third thing people notice in the
[1:08:07] painting as you look at the ark and you
[1:08:10] realize there's people in that
[1:08:13] Ark why are the people in that
[1:08:16] Ark because of his
[1:08:19] grace another characteristic of the
[1:08:23] heart of God grace
[1:08:26] where would we be without his
[1:08:31] grace Genesis 68 but Noah found Grace in
[1:08:36] the eyes of the
[1:08:39] Lord as as God's looking around sees all
[1:08:43] of this evil but this one man found
[1:08:49] Grace and you know that Ark was open to
[1:08:54] anyone that would come the grace was
[1:08:57] there for them but they would not accept
[1:09:01] his grace it was there but they wouldn't
[1:09:04] accept
[1:09:05] it Genesis
[1:09:08] 1917-19 and it came to pass when they
[1:09:11] had brought them from brought them forth
[1:09:14] abroad that he said Escape for thy life
[1:09:18] look not behind thee neither stay thou
[1:09:20] in all the plain escape to the mountain
[1:09:23] lest thou be consumed and lot said unto
[1:09:26] them oh not so my Lord behold now thy
[1:09:31] servant hath found Grace in thy sight
[1:09:34] and thou Hast magnified the mer thy
[1:09:36] mercy which thou has showed unto me in
[1:09:39] saving my life and I cannot escape to
[1:09:41] the mountain lest some evil take me and
[1:09:44] I die
[1:09:47] lot he did nothing to deserve this Grace
[1:09:51] lot knew better and yet he stayed in a
[1:09:55] city city that was so
[1:09:59] evil that God was going to destroy this
[1:10:02] place and lot knowing better stayed
[1:10:05] there with them because of wealth
[1:10:08] because of his
[1:10:09] Comforts he would not separate himself
[1:10:12] from them lot did not deserve Grace but
[1:10:16] because God is so full of
[1:10:21] grace he gave them a way of Escape
[1:10:27] Mark
[1:10:28] 59 and he h and he asked him what is thy
[1:10:32] name I couldn't leave this one out
[1:10:33] brother Tommy and he answered saying my
[1:10:37] name is Legion for we are
[1:10:41] many Legion of me you've heard this this
[1:10:45] man did nothing to deserve the grace of
[1:10:51] God it was just simply the fact that
[1:10:54] before the foundation of the world God
[1:10:56] had looked down through time and he saw
[1:11:00] this
[1:11:01] man and he knew the decision that this
[1:11:04] man would make if he could just be
[1:11:08] freed and so by the grace of
[1:11:11] God by the grace of the heart of God he
[1:11:16] spent a trip to go over the sea to one
[1:11:20] man that's Grace nothing he could have
[1:11:24] done to deserve it
[1:11:25] there was nothing he could do to deserve
[1:11:27] that but the grace of
[1:11:30] [Applause]
[1:11:32] God acts 9 1 to8 I I'm not going to read
[1:11:36] this whole thing and Saul yet breathing
[1:11:38] out threatenings and Slaughter against
[1:11:40] the Disciples of the Lord went to the
[1:11:42] high priest desired of him letters to
[1:11:45] Damascus to the synagogues that he found
[1:11:47] any of the way whether they were men or
[1:11:49] women he might bring them bound to unto
[1:11:52] Jerusalem we know this story this man
[1:11:57] saw on his way to round
[1:12:01] up Christians to round up
[1:12:03] Believers to put him in prison to have
[1:12:06] him put to death a man that stood and
[1:12:10] held the coats of the men that stoned
[1:12:13] Stephen to
[1:12:15] death that
[1:12:18] man and yet the grace of God was
[1:12:22] powerful enough to cover that
[1:12:26] sin I can't imagine being Paul having to
[1:12:30] live with that on my
[1:12:32] conscience but for the grace of God I am
[1:12:37] what I am that's what he said but for
[1:12:41] the grace of
[1:12:42] God that's the grace of
[1:12:46] God Luke 23 39 to
[1:12:50] 43 and one of the Mal
[1:12:53] factors which
[1:12:56] were hanged railed on him saying if thou
[1:12:59] be Christ save thyself and us but the
[1:13:02] other answering rebuked him saying Dost
[1:13:06] not thou fear God seeing Thou Art in the
[1:13:10] same
[1:13:11] condemnation and we indeed justly for we
[1:13:14] receive the due reward of our Deeds but
[1:13:17] this man hath done nothing amiss and he
[1:13:20] said unto Jesus Lord remember me when
[1:13:23] thou comest into thy King Kingdom and
[1:13:26] Jesus said unto him verily I say unto
[1:13:28] thee today shalt thou be with me in
[1:13:32] Paradise a convicted criminal sentenced
[1:13:35] to
[1:13:36] death reached
[1:13:38] out at the last moment of his
[1:13:43] life and the Heart of God hanging there
[1:13:47] that did not deserve it he did nothing
[1:13:50] to deserve what was
[1:13:53] happening he did it because of
[1:13:55] compassion he did it because of mercy
[1:13:58] and now hanging on the cross he shows
[1:14:00] his grace to a man that did not deserve
[1:14:04] it in his dying breath he's asking will
[1:14:10] you give me
[1:14:11] Grace and he was
[1:14:14] granted I don't know what that man's
[1:14:16] life looked like up to that moment I can
[1:14:18] tell you he got there for a
[1:14:22] reason and yet in this last last
[1:14:26] moment a few hours after that he was in
[1:14:30] Paradise because of the grace of
[1:14:33] God we could tell story after story of
[1:14:37] the what the grace of God has done what
[1:14:40] it's looked like in our
[1:14:44] lives we love Grace we need Grace I
[1:14:48] needed
[1:14:49] Grace I needed Grace if not more than
[1:14:52] anybody sitting in this room I needed
[1:14:54] Grace
[1:14:56] I did nothing to deserve what he did for
[1:14:59] me but yet here I stand and I say just
[1:15:02] like Paul I because of the grace of God
[1:15:06] I am what I
[1:15:10] am
[1:15:12] compassion Mercy Grace the
[1:15:16] characteristics of the heart of
[1:15:20] God the fourth
[1:15:22] thing that people see in this
[1:15:31] painting this
[1:15:33] mountain it's over here to the side as
[1:15:37] you start looking at the painting a
[1:15:39] little
[1:15:40] closer you start realizing that there
[1:15:43] are
[1:15:44] people on this
[1:15:47] mountain their hands are up and they're
[1:15:49] crying
[1:15:50] out they're looking at they're looking
[1:15:53] down at the ark they're climbing to the
[1:15:56] highest part that they can get to
[1:15:57] because the water's
[1:15:59] Rising this thing that they'd never
[1:16:01] heard of before in their life was
[1:16:03] happening the rain was falling and the
[1:16:06] waters were
[1:16:10] rising and because of God's compassion
[1:16:13] because of his Mercy because of his
[1:16:16] grace the way of Escape was right
[1:16:20] there and they didn't take
[1:16:23] it but what what are they looking at
[1:16:27] now the
[1:16:31] anger
[1:16:34] anger another
[1:16:36] characteristic of the heart of
[1:16:39] God now some people would say wait a
[1:16:42] minute anger that's a sin no anger is
[1:16:43] not a sin anger is an
[1:16:47] emotion and it is a
[1:16:49] characteristic of the heart of God
[1:16:52] numbers 25 1:5 and Israel Abode in
[1:16:56] chidam and the people began to commit
[1:16:58] whoredom with the daughters of Moab and
[1:17:01] they called the people unto sacrifices
[1:17:03] of their gods and the people did eat and
[1:17:06] bow down to their gods and Israel joined
[1:17:08] himself unto bpor and the anger of the
[1:17:12] Lord was kindled against Israel and the
[1:17:15] Lord said unto Moses take all the heads
[1:17:17] of the people and hang them up before
[1:17:20] the Lord against the Sun that the the
[1:17:23] the that the fierce anger of the Lord
[1:17:25] may be turned away from Israel and Moses
[1:17:28] said unto the judges of Israel slay ye
[1:17:32] everyone his men that were joined unto
[1:17:36] bpor this is the anger of
[1:17:41] God kill every single one of
[1:17:44] them that joined into this or I'll take
[1:17:48] every one of you out I'll kill you
[1:17:51] all he's a jealous God
[1:17:55] his anger was kindled against his
[1:17:59] people because of the way that they were
[1:18:02] acting he brought them out of Egypt with
[1:18:06] his compassion with his Mercy with his
[1:18:10] grace and yet now they're turning away
[1:18:13] from
[1:18:15] him and the other characteristic of the
[1:18:18] heart of God the anger started to be
[1:18:23] kindled mark 11 12 to 14 and on the
[1:18:27] tomorrow when they were come from
[1:18:29] Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig
[1:18:32] tree a far off having leaves he came if
[1:18:36] happily he might find anything there on
[1:18:39] and when he came to it he found nothing
[1:18:42] but leaves for the time of figs was not
[1:18:45] yet this is when he's coming down from
[1:18:48] from from his his time there he hasn't
[1:18:51] ate in a while he sees a fig tree Christ
[1:18:55] a man a Hungry Man The Heart Of God a
[1:19:00] Hungry Man and as he walks up to this
[1:19:03] fig tree and it has no figs on it I you
[1:19:08] can call maybe he got hangry you know
[1:19:10] the man was hungry and he got mad
[1:19:13] because this tree did not have figs on
[1:19:15] it and he cursed the tree because he was
[1:19:19] angry this wasn't a temper tantrum he
[1:19:22] was mad and he cursed that tree it's you
[1:19:26] know types there's a type here the
[1:19:29] treated was not producing fruit the way
[1:19:33] it's supposed to be producing fruit so
[1:19:35] he cursed it and the tree Withers up and
[1:19:40] dies you guys getting the type here
[1:19:43] right his
[1:19:47] anger John 2
[1:19:49] 13-6 and the Jews Passover was at hand
[1:19:53] anded Jesus went up to J Jerusalem and
[1:19:55] he found in the temple those that sold
[1:19:58] oxen and sheep and doves and the
[1:20:01] Changers of money sitting and when he
[1:20:03] had made a scorge of small cords he
[1:20:06] drove them all out of the temple and the
[1:20:09] sheep and The Oxen and poured out the
[1:20:12] Changers money and overthrew the
[1:20:17] tables he saw this happening in the
[1:20:21] Lord's
[1:20:22] house and he got angry
[1:20:25] I was sitting in a service one time and
[1:20:27] a brother was preaching and and he he
[1:20:30] asked he asked the it's a dangerous
[1:20:32] thing when you asked the congregation
[1:20:33] something but he asked the
[1:20:35] congregation you know because he was
[1:20:38] talking about temper and he said you
[1:20:40] know did did Jesus did you ever see
[1:20:43] Jesus have a temper and a man yelled out
[1:20:45] what about when he was in the
[1:20:47] temple this wasn't a temper this was he
[1:20:50] was mad he had every right to be mad was
[1:20:56] anger and because of the anger he did
[1:21:00] what needed to be done what anybody
[1:21:02] should have done he grabbed some cords
[1:21:05] put them together and started beating
[1:21:07] people out of
[1:21:08] there through the tables
[1:21:11] over not in my
[1:21:17] house so another
[1:21:20] characteristic of the heart of God
[1:21:23] anger how many times did Moses stand in
[1:21:25] the breach for the PE for the children
[1:21:27] of
[1:21:28] Israel because he got angry with them so
[1:21:33] many times he would have just destroyed
[1:21:35] them if it would not have been for
[1:21:39] Moses Noah
[1:21:42] Sodom he always makes a way of
[1:21:47] Escape when he starts getting
[1:21:50] angry and he knows that the end is
[1:21:53] coming the is only going to allow this
[1:21:56] to go on so long he will always make a
[1:21:58] way of Escape but it's not because he's
[1:22:01] not
[1:22:06] angry prayer however can change
[1:22:11] things Moses did it time and time
[1:22:16] again a god of anger about to destroy
[1:22:21] his own people and yet a prophet would
[1:22:23] stand there and pray and it would change
[1:22:28] the mind of God would change some he had
[1:22:32] already made up his mind what he was
[1:22:33] going to do and yet prayer would change
[1:22:38] his
[1:22:41] mind the last thing that people see in
[1:22:44] this painting it was the last thing I
[1:22:47] saw in this painting in fact it took me
[1:22:49] a day before I ever even saw
[1:22:52] it here's the painting The Ark the storm
[1:22:56] the waves crashing in on the Ark on the
[1:22:59] mountain the clouds the
[1:23:01] lightning you see the
[1:23:04] people on the
[1:23:06] mountain and then you realize what
[1:23:08] they're looking up
[1:23:10] at because up here in a cloud there's a
[1:23:14] face and it's an angry
[1:23:17] face it's the face of
[1:23:21] Wrath which is another character istic
[1:23:25] of the heart of
[1:23:27] God is
[1:23:30] wrath Exodus 32
[1:23:34] 7-1 and the Lord said unto Moses go get
[1:23:37] thee down for that people which thou
[1:23:40] broughtest out of the land of Egypt have
[1:23:43] corrupted themselves they have turned
[1:23:46] aside quickly out of the way which I
[1:23:48] commanded them I think it's very
[1:23:52] interesting that in this moment right
[1:23:54] here and the Lord said to Moses go get
[1:23:56] thee down for the thy people which thou
[1:24:00] brought out of Egypt if I remember right
[1:24:03] at the burning bush this conversation
[1:24:05] looked a whole lot differently Moses is
[1:24:07] doing everything that he can to not go
[1:24:10] do this because he's not capable of
[1:24:12] doing it and God is trying to convince
[1:24:15] him you all you got to do is go I'll
[1:24:18] take care of it from
[1:24:21] there because he was going to bring them
[1:24:24] out God was going to bring it out but
[1:24:26] now he's telling Moses the ones that you
[1:24:29] brought out of
[1:24:32] Egypt they have turned aside quickly out
[1:24:34] of the way which I commanded them they
[1:24:36] have made them a molten calf and have
[1:24:38] worshiped it and have sacrificed there
[1:24:41] unto and
[1:24:42] said these by these be thy Gods oh
[1:24:46] Israel which which have brought thee up
[1:24:49] out of the land of Egypt and the Lord
[1:24:52] said unto Moses I have seen this people
[1:24:54] and behold it is a stiff necked
[1:24:56] people brother Thomas read a scripture
[1:25:00] last night where Christ says the exact
[1:25:02] same thing now therefore let me alone
[1:25:05] that my wrath May Wax Hot against them
[1:25:08] and that I may consume them and I will
[1:25:11] make of thee a great nation he's telling
[1:25:13] Moses step
[1:25:16] aside I'm angry with them I've done I've
[1:25:19] showed compassion I've showed Mercy I've
[1:25:22] showed Grace
[1:25:24] but now it's time for wrath I've had
[1:25:28] enough get out of the way I'm going to
[1:25:31] destroy every one of them but I'll raise
[1:25:34] you up another Nation
[1:25:37] Moses and Moses besought the Lord his
[1:25:40] God and said Lord why do thy wrath Wax
[1:25:45] Hot against thy people which thou Hast
[1:25:49] brought forth out of the land of Egypt
[1:25:52] with great power and with with a mighty
[1:25:56] hand it's
[1:25:58] almost as if he's reminding the Lord as
[1:26:01] his
[1:26:02] servant I didn't bring them out you did
[1:26:06] and you brought them out for a
[1:26:10] reason he sees the wrath of God is
[1:26:15] coming John 213-
[1:26:20] 16 we're going back to the to the uh the
[1:26:24] Passover here the money
[1:26:27] changers you know as as as as Jesus
[1:26:29] walked up on this scene and he sees
[1:26:31] what's going on in his in the in the
[1:26:33] house of God he starts getting
[1:26:36] angry and he starts binding those cords
[1:26:39] together why because the Wrath was
[1:26:43] coming the Wrath is what starts beating
[1:26:46] the Wrath is what starts turning the
[1:26:48] tables
[1:26:49] over that's the Wrath the same thing uh
[1:26:53] uh with the with the fig tree you know
[1:26:56] he walks upon the tree the anger was
[1:26:58] there because there's no
[1:27:00] figs the Wrath part was the tree
[1:27:03] withered out withered up because wrath
[1:27:07] is a characteristic of the heart of
[1:27:12] God Revelations 61 12-1 17 and I'm going
[1:27:16] to read this in the King James and I'm
[1:27:18] also going to read this in the
[1:27:21] Amplified and I beheld when he had
[1:27:23] opened the six seal and lo there was a
[1:27:26] great earthquake and the sun became
[1:27:28] black as sack sackcloth of of hair and
[1:27:32] the moon became as blood and the stars
[1:27:34] of Heaven fell unto the Earth even as a
[1:27:37] fig tree casteth her untimely figs when
[1:27:41] she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the
[1:27:43] heaven departed as a srel went in in it
[1:27:47] is rolled together and every mountain
[1:27:49] and Island were moved out of their
[1:27:51] places and the kings of the earth and
[1:27:53] the great men and the rich men and the
[1:27:56] chief captains and the Mighty Men And
[1:27:59] every Bond Man and every free man hid
[1:28:02] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[1:28:04] of the mountains and said to the
[1:28:06] mountains and rocks fall on us and hide
[1:28:09] us from the face of him that sth on the
[1:28:11] throne and from the Wrath of the lamb
[1:28:16] for the great day of his wrath is come
[1:28:19] and who shall be able to
[1:28:21] stand same same Revelation 6 15 to 17
[1:28:24] and the
[1:28:26] Amplified then the kings of the earth
[1:28:28] and the Great Men of the military
[1:28:30] commanders and the wealthy and the
[1:28:32] strong and everyone whether slave or
[1:28:35] free hid themselves in the caves and
[1:28:39] among the rocks of the mountains and
[1:28:41] they called out to the mountains and the
[1:28:43] Rocks fall on us and hide us from the
[1:28:46] face of him who sits on the throne and
[1:28:49] from the righteous wrath and ignation of
[1:28:53] the Lamb for the great day of their
[1:28:56] wrath and and Vengeance and rep
[1:28:59] retribution has come and who is able to
[1:29:02] face God and stand before the Wrath of
[1:29:06] the
[1:29:08] Lamb this is speaking to the end times
[1:29:12] what's coming
[1:29:14] people these
[1:29:16] are great
[1:29:19] men I this could be the president of the
[1:29:21] United States for all I know didn't
[1:29:24] matter if you were poor didn't matter if
[1:29:26] you were Rich you are in a situation
[1:29:29] right
[1:29:30] now that you cannot get out of the wrath
[1:29:35] of God is now upon you and there's
[1:29:38] nothing you can do to escape it he's
[1:29:41] already tried with his compassion he's
[1:29:43] already given you Mercy he's already
[1:29:46] given you Grace but now the Wrath is
[1:29:49] upon
[1:29:51] you the doors to the ark are now
[1:29:55] closed and the rain has started to
[1:29:59] fall can you imagine being those people
[1:30:02] in that
[1:30:04] day Noah and his family have now went
[1:30:07] into this Ark and everybody has been
[1:30:09] making fun of this man for 120
[1:30:14] years and all of a sudden a raindrop
[1:30:16] hits you in the
[1:30:18] face what was
[1:30:21] that and then another and another
[1:30:25] what was the last thing that these
[1:30:27] people were
[1:30:28] seeing it was the wrath of
[1:30:32] God he did everything he could to save
[1:30:37] because not he doesn't want to see one
[1:30:39] of them
[1:30:41] lost even through his anger he doesn't
[1:30:44] want to lose
[1:30:46] one but they would not accept anything
[1:30:50] that he provided for them and now the
[1:30:53] last thing that they're seeing is the
[1:30:55] wrath of God the children of Israel
[1:30:58] wandering around in the desert until the
[1:31:01] entire generation died
[1:31:05] off the last thing that those people saw
[1:31:08] was the wrath of God all of the miracle
[1:31:12] they traveled with a
[1:31:15] prophet they traveled with the pillar of
[1:31:18] fire food fell out of the sky everything
[1:31:23] these people had
[1:31:26] seen the the the compassion for those
[1:31:29] people those were his chosen people the
[1:31:32] compassion the mercy the grace that he
[1:31:37] had and all of the signs and wonders
[1:31:40] they
[1:31:41] saw and yet the last thing that they saw
[1:31:45] was the wrath of
[1:31:48] God the people in
[1:31:51] Sodom living an moral
[1:31:57] lifestyle we know what they were doing
[1:31:59] the
[1:32:04] homosexuality he gave them every
[1:32:08] opportunity I know in the in the message
[1:32:10] that you know homosexuality that's like
[1:32:12] a phobia don't get too close to that guy
[1:32:15] I might catch
[1:32:19] that Moses stood in the gap for these
[1:32:21] people who's standing in the gap for
[1:32:23] them
[1:32:26] he could not step over Moses that's what
[1:32:28] brother Bram said he could not his wrath
[1:32:33] could not step over the
[1:32:35] prophet who's standing in the Gap
[1:32:38] now the Bride of Jesus Christ that's
[1:32:42] us and we're running from him like we're
[1:32:44] going to catch
[1:32:46] something the Wrath is coming
[1:32:54] the last thing those people
[1:32:56] saw was a ball of Fire coming at
[1:33:01] them after he had given them every
[1:33:06] opportunity even through his
[1:33:08] anger but here comes the
[1:33:13] Wrath this is always the last thing that
[1:33:16] people
[1:33:18] see I don't know who those people were
[1:33:20] there last night the ones that got up
[1:33:23] when he started preaching on what I'm
[1:33:25] talking about right
[1:33:27] now but they did not want to hear that
[1:33:30] part they want to sit in their little
[1:33:33] churches or their big mega churches and
[1:33:35] all they want to do is hear how good God
[1:33:38] is what God can do for a man that
[1:33:41] doesn't deserve anything no I don't mean
[1:33:44] that brother Tommy and I didn't deserve
[1:33:46] it either but that's all they want to
[1:33:48] hear is how good he is they want to hear
[1:33:51] about his Mercy his grace his compassion
[1:33:54] they don't want to hear his wrath is
[1:34:00] coming why does he always send that
[1:34:02] warning why does he always make that way
[1:34:05] of Escape because he's already angry his
[1:34:09] anger's already been kindled before that
[1:34:12] moment he knows that the that
[1:34:15] destruction's coming he knows I'm only
[1:34:17] going to deal with this so
[1:34:19] much but I'm going to give you every
[1:34:23] opportunity
[1:34:25] before the Wrath hits Noah day he sent
[1:34:30] the ark he had a man preach for 120
[1:34:32] years about something that had never
[1:34:33] happened the days of Sodom he went down
[1:34:37] he sent some angels to see if they could
[1:34:39] find
[1:34:41] anybody so what about
[1:34:48] today if he never
[1:34:52] changes the Ang ER is what comes first
[1:34:57] people then he provides the way of
[1:35:00] Escape there would not need to be a way
[1:35:02] of Escape if there was no
[1:35:06] anger why did he send William
[1:35:10] brandom a way of Escape his compassion
[1:35:15] was to
[1:35:16] send William
[1:35:19] branam his
[1:35:20] Mercy was the fact that you would hear
[1:35:23] it
[1:35:25] his grace is the fact that you're
[1:35:27] sitting here right
[1:35:30] now what comes next people the
[1:35:37] Wrath 1962
[1:35:41] presuming but they say oh he is a good
[1:35:44] god he is a good God but don't you
[1:35:47] presume on that he is a God of Justice
[1:35:50] too he is a good god like a little
[1:35:53] teenage boy said not long ago said you
[1:35:56] know God is so good he just don't care
[1:35:58] what I do nonsense He does care what you
[1:36:02] do yeah you say God is a good God God is
[1:36:06] a good God but we hear too much of that
[1:36:09] today God is a god of wrath he is a god
[1:36:13] of judgment he was God enough to go down
[1:36:16] there and take Israel right out of the
[1:36:18] mouth of death and turned right turned
[1:36:22] turned right in the wilderness and let
[1:36:24] them rot because they wouldn't follow
[1:36:26] him God has a good God was a good God to
[1:36:31] pull you Pentecostals out of them
[1:36:34] organizations but you turned right back
[1:36:36] around and acted like your Mammy so
[1:36:38] you're rotting in it there's a tape
[1:36:41] recorder going on here it goes around
[1:36:44] the world you know I'm not sure I'm not
[1:36:47] so much speaking here now but you rot
[1:36:51] right in it then come tell you the truth
[1:36:55] then you don't believe it here it is
[1:36:58] wrote right here see in the word yes
[1:37:03] sir there's a tape being recorded right
[1:37:07] now that's going to go around the
[1:37:12] world because his wrath is
[1:37:14] coming he's a god of wrath
[1:37:19] 1963 is your life worthy of the Gospel
[1:37:23] now we see when God gives a man an
[1:37:25] invitation and to do something or to
[1:37:27] receive the invitation that he's given
[1:37:29] him and he returns it and he returns it
[1:37:32] down then there's nothing left after
[1:37:35] Mercy is spurned but judgment if you
[1:37:38] step over the boundaries of Mercy then
[1:37:41] there's only one thing left and that is
[1:37:43] Judgment brother bam talks about how you
[1:37:46] will have to crawl over every boundary
[1:37:49] every obstacle that he puts in front of
[1:37:52] you to go to hell
[1:37:56] and we find that man has done that in
[1:37:59] all ages it's happened most every age in
[1:38:02] the Bible when God sent Noah his servant
[1:38:05] and made a way of an escape for all the
[1:38:07] people who wanted to be saved but the
[1:38:10] people only laughed and scorned at Noah
[1:38:12] but God made the way but they had an
[1:38:15] excuse it wasn't according to their to
[1:38:18] their modern thinking it did it wasn't
[1:38:21] the way they wanted it so they made made
[1:38:23] excuses in the days of Noah they made
[1:38:26] excuses in the days of Moses they made
[1:38:28] excuses in the Days of Elijah they made
[1:38:31] excuses in the days of Christ and they
[1:38:34] make excuses
[1:38:40] today we're in a message
[1:38:43] church we believe the
[1:38:45] message
[1:38:48] right because of his compassion his
[1:38:51] Mercy his grace
[1:38:54] he's made a way of
[1:38:56] Escape his wrath is coming
[1:39:02] next but let me give you some good
[1:39:05] news 1959 thinking on our way we don't
[1:39:10] mean by that that we're going to heal
[1:39:13] anyone we believe that by the grace of
[1:39:17] God we're going to let them know that
[1:39:19] God has already healed them and they are
[1:39:22] just they and they are just
[1:39:25] accepted it then just as we're trying to
[1:39:29] let the sinner know that God loves him
[1:39:32] and he's already saved him if he will
[1:39:35] just accept it it's the work that Christ
[1:39:38] finished at Calvary when he made that
[1:39:40] all sufficient word saying it is
[1:39:42] finished the whole Plan of Salvation all
[1:39:46] that could be done for mankind by the
[1:39:48] heart of God was finished when Christ
[1:39:51] said those words God's plan was is
[1:39:53] completed we just have to have faith to
[1:39:57] receive what he has finished for
[1:40:01] us the sin question was settled at
[1:40:05] Calvary sickness was settled at Calvary
[1:40:09] eternal life was settled at Calvary
[1:40:12] everything we have need of was settled
[1:40:14] at Calvary because of his compassion
[1:40:17] because of his Mercy because of his
[1:40:20] grace
[1:40:24] he's already shown he's
[1:40:26] angry he would have never sent William
[1:40:28] Brown of if there wasn't anger if we
[1:40:31] didn't need a way of Escape he would not
[1:40:34] have needed to send
[1:40:37] him he's done everything he can possibly
[1:40:43] do to let us get
[1:40:48] out wrath is
[1:40:50] coming so my question Church
[1:40:54] is are you
[1:40:57] ready because it's coming nothing's
[1:41:00] going to stop it nothing can stop it the
[1:41:05] Wrath is
[1:41:11] coming you look at the the the world in
[1:41:14] its condition today as as brother Thomas
[1:41:17] just said last night brother Bram
[1:41:20] said how much worse can it get before
[1:41:22] he's going to be obligated to raise up
[1:41:24] Sodom and apologize to him how much
[1:41:28] longer do we
[1:41:31] have his
[1:41:33] compassion he sent us a prophit his
[1:41:36] Mercy he's allowed you to hear it he's
[1:41:40] allowed you to hear
[1:41:41] it the one sitting right here he has
[1:41:44] allowed you me to hear it because of his
[1:41:51] Mercy because of his
[1:41:55] compassion you're sitting here right now
[1:41:58] because of his
[1:42:00] Mercy each and every one of
[1:42:03] us because of his
[1:42:06] grace he's extended the
[1:42:10] grace but the Wrath is what
[1:42:14] follows are you
[1:42:17] ready when the Rapture takes
[1:42:21] place the world is not going to know
[1:42:24] what
[1:42:26] happened there's going to be so few
[1:42:29] people brother Brown talks about this it
[1:42:33] the world even if there was a million of
[1:42:35] us gone that's nothing 8 billion people
[1:42:39] on this planet a million people gone is
[1:42:42] nothing the world is not going to have
[1:42:45] the first clue as to what happened it's
[1:42:48] just going to start getting worse and
[1:42:50] worse and
[1:42:51] worse can you it's this bad now and his
[1:42:54] spirit is still here what will it be
[1:42:57] like when he removes his Spirit from
[1:42:59] this place I do not want to be here I
[1:43:02] will not be
[1:43:09] here when the Rapture takes place though
[1:43:13] the world will not know what happened
[1:43:16] but you
[1:43:18] will you think about that church the
[1:43:22] people sitting in message churches that
[1:43:25] all of a sudden on Sunday morning
[1:43:28] because they only come to church on
[1:43:29] Sunday
[1:43:31] morning when they show up and half the
[1:43:33] people aren't there or maybe five or six
[1:43:37] aren't
[1:43:38] there and then they
[1:43:40] call this church down the road hey you
[1:43:45] know is is uh you know are these people
[1:43:47] over there cuz you know our pastor's not
[1:43:49] here we're ready to have church but our
[1:43:52] pastor's not here
[1:43:55] we're just wondering uh and then them
[1:43:57] saying about uh you know it's funny
[1:43:59] we're having the same problem here and
[1:44:02] you start
[1:44:04] calling and then fear is going to set in
[1:44:07] because it's not going to take a whole
[1:44:09] lot to figure out what has
[1:44:15] happened I talked to I've talked to to
[1:44:19] to
[1:44:22] people and when I ask the question are
[1:44:24] you
[1:44:25] ready and the answer is I yeah I believe
[1:44:29] I am I believe I'm ready I I I think I
[1:44:31] think I'm
[1:44:32] ready and then I point out this
[1:44:42] quote and I it's really how can you be
[1:44:46] certain that you're
[1:44:47] ready is is more of the question and and
[1:44:51] when I point this quote out
[1:44:53] let me just read it
[1:44:56] 1963 questions answers on the
[1:45:00] seals someone said well there is no need
[1:45:03] for me trying it brother brandham said
[1:45:06] there's only one only be one saved out
[1:45:09] of Jeffersonville see now see it's

[1:46:32] that I am the one going something's
[1:46:35] wrong something's wrong with your faith
[1:46:39] and I'm telling you that wrath is
[1:46:42] coming so I'm asking you don't leave

[1:47:20] your children father your people people
[1:47:23] father that Lord we know that you're a
[1:47:26] compassionate God there wouldn't be a
[1:47:28] one of us sitting here if it wasn't for
[1:47:30] your compassion your mercy and your
[1:47:32] grace father but Lord we always forget
[1:47:35] about the
