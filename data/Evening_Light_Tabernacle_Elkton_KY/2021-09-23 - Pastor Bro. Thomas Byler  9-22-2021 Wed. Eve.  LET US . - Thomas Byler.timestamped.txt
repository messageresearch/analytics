[35:31] able to send assemble together lord
[35:34] jesus with your children father and
[35:36] knowing god that you're being in our
[35:38] midst as according as you have promised
[35:40] wherever two or three are gathered in
[35:41] your name
[35:42] there you will be in our midst lord
[35:45] father we just think about where we
[35:46] would be if you would have lifted the
[35:48] holy spirit from the earth already lord
[35:50] if you weren't here with us anymore lord
[35:52] how what a horrible thing that would be
[35:54] father so we're so grateful lord jesus
[35:56] to have you with us
[35:57] even in us to the end of the world
[36:00] we ask god that you just bless the
[36:01] meditation of our heart the thought
[36:03] which we feel like you've laid upon our
[36:04] heart to speak on we ask god that you
[36:07] just take control of my heart my lips my
[36:09] mind my thought and just say the things
[36:11] that you once said lord and help us
[36:12] father just

[36:34] understand it with our heart in jesus
[36:36] name we ask it amen and amen amen so i
[36:41] want to speak on another thought that i
[36:42] spoke uh told you i wanted to speak on
[36:44] he meant something that it's just real
[36:46] kind of different but amen it's just
[36:49] what i felt like it was law known to my
[36:51] heart so that's what we'll do is that
[36:52] okay
[36:53] and we'll turn to
[36:55] i think we'll go first to
[36:57] the old testament this this came to my
[37:00] mind whenever i begin to think about
[37:03] this
[37:04] this thought this this little story came
[37:07] to my mind and i thought it was good
[37:10] so we'll start with second kings
[37:13] i'm gonna put this down lower so it
[37:15] doesn't poof like that
[37:17] all right second king seven
[37:21] uh three through nine
[37:30] now just to lay up you don't have to
[37:32] read it just yet but let me lay out a
[37:34] little bit
[37:35] of a thought here
[37:36] the king i believe
[37:38] of syria had surrounded samaria
[37:42] and they were inside of the city all
[37:43] walled up and they were in great
[37:46] distress they were running out of food
[37:49] they were starving them out the syrians
[37:51] had plenty
[37:53] but the israelites didn't have hardly
[37:54] anything to eat at one point the king
[37:57] went walking by the wall
[37:59] and the woman calls out to him and he
[38:01] wanted some
[38:03] justice i guess and
[38:05] and she was saying help me help me and
[38:07] so forth and says what do you want me to
[38:08] help you with well
[38:10] she said that she had made this
[38:12] agreement with this one woman they both
[38:14] had babies and these uh the
[38:17] one woman says look let's uh kill your
[38:19] baby today and boil it need it and then
[38:22] tomorrow we'll kill mine
[38:24] so the one woman did she killed her
[38:26] child and they ate it and uh come the
[38:28] next day
[38:30] the other one hit it you know and so
[38:32] this is what this woman was wanting
[38:33] wanting the king to find his baby so
[38:35] this is kind of the stress
[38:37] situation that they were in it was an
[38:39] entire situation amen
[38:42] and so
[38:43] but you know elijah had prophesied he
[38:45] had prophesied that tomorrow
[38:47] i mean you're going to be eating good
[38:49] it's going to to put it in us other
[38:51] words he says you're going to it's going
[38:52] to be there's going to be plenty there
[38:54] and the king didn't believe it and says
[38:56] only if god opened the windows of heaven
[38:58] would anything like this happen and then
[39:00] elisha prophesied well you're going to
[39:02] see it but you're not going to partake
[39:03] of it and the next day when it all
[39:05] happened he was ran over by the crowd
[39:08] amen and killed i mean right about the
[39:10] time that he saw
[39:12] but just before all that happened and
[39:14] after the prophecy was made
[39:16] there was four lepers in chapter seven
[39:18] and verse three it says and there was
[39:19] four lepers leprous men
[39:22] at the entering in of the gate and they
[39:24] said one to another why sit we here
[39:27] until we die
[39:29] if we say we will enter into this city
[39:31] then the famine is in the city and we
[39:34] shall die there and if we sit here still
[39:37] here we die also
[39:39] now therefore come and let us amen let
[39:43] us fall into the hosts of the syrians
[39:46] amen if they save us alive we will live
[39:50] and if they kill us well we shall but
[39:52] die amen said they don't they knew they
[39:55] didn't have much of an option
[39:57] right
[39:58] but they made a decision here they made
[40:00] a choice right
[40:01] and this word
[40:03] uh
[40:04] let i want to talk about that for a
[40:06] little bit just let word here in a
[40:08] minute but we shall live and if they
[40:10] shall kill us we shall die and they rush
[40:12] up rose up in the twilight
[40:15] i guess just before daylight to go into
[40:17] the camp of the syrians and when they
[40:20] were come to the other most parts of the
[40:22] camp at the syrians behold there was no
[40:24] man there for the lord had made the host
[40:27] of the experience to hear a noise
[40:30] how many remembers i always say god can
[40:32] control your mind he can control your
[40:34] ears
[40:36] amen and so god was controlling their
[40:39] minds he was controlling their ears and
[40:41] to hear a noise of chariots and a noise
[40:45] of horses
[40:46] you and i can only imagine what this
[40:49] sound sounded like
[40:51] to scare
[40:52] the liver so to speak out of this camp
[40:55] of syrians
[40:57] right until this is what they did
[41:00] even the noise of a great hosts and they
[41:03] said one to another lord the king of
[41:05] israel
[41:06] has hired us
[41:08] the has hired against us the kings of
[41:10] the hittites and the kings of the
[41:12] egyptians to come upon us
[41:15] wherefore they also
[41:17] they they arose and fled into twilight
[41:20] and left their tents and their horses
[41:22] and their asses even the camp as it was
[41:25] and fled for their life like i said it
[41:29] really scared them because they didn't
[41:30] take nothing
[41:31] with them
[41:33] yeah
[41:34] and when these lepers came to the utmost
[41:36] parts of the camp they went in
[41:38] tent and did eat and drink and carry
[41:40] thin silver and gold and raymond
[41:44] and when did hit it
[41:46] these guys were having a blast
[41:49] let's go hide this stuff
[41:51] all right
[41:52] oh my
[41:53] you come again and and went and hit it
[41:55] and come again and entered into another
[41:57] tent and carried things also went and
[42:00] hit it
[42:01] we're gonna be poor no more folks right
[42:04] my what a blessing just for the choice
[42:06] they made right they made a choice
[42:09] and they got blessed for it amen
[42:12] then say what's then said they one to
[42:14] another we do not well this day is a day
[42:16] of good tidings and if we hold our peace
[42:19] if we carry till the morning in other
[42:21] words if we're too greedy here some
[42:23] mischief will come upon us now therefore
[42:26] come that we may go and tell the king's
[42:28] household may god add his blessings to
[42:30] the reading of the words you can be
[42:31] seated tonight
[42:33] amen so we find out there that of course
[42:35] he went he told the king and the king
[42:37] wouldn't believe it he just believed
[42:39] that they made it look like that they
[42:41] were just
[42:42] you know running away and so forth and
[42:44] some of his counselors convinced him to
[42:47] take about five of the horses that they
[42:48] had and to go out and find out if it was
[42:51] so as they had said and of course it was
[42:54] amen
[42:56] god had driven the enemy plum out of the
[42:58] out of out of the country so to speak
[43:00] and they went and they had plenty of
[43:04] everything based on the fact that these
[43:06] uh
[43:07] you know the messengers told them now
[43:09] look back at these lepers these lepers
[43:11] made a choice amen we want to look at
[43:13] that word tonight with the help of the
[43:14] lord
[43:15] let us
[43:16] let
[43:17] us over in isaiah i'm going to just go
[43:20] to isaiah
[43:22] for a minute
[43:23] but in isaiah 1 and verse 18 he says
[43:26] come
[43:28] god says to us
[43:29] come now and let us read it together
[43:32] saith the lord though your sins be a
[43:34] scarlet they shall be as white as snow
[43:37] though they be red like crimson they
[43:39] shall be as wool this is one place that
[43:42] god invites us
[43:45] to come and to reason together i believe
[43:47] the brother man features a message
[43:48] called conferences how that god wants to
[43:51] have a conference with us amen how many
[43:54] how many believe that god wants to have
[43:56] a conference with all of humanity he
[44:00] invites us to come to him
[44:02] amen so i begin to look at this word let
[44:05] us
[44:06] amen in other words let's let us do this
[44:09] or
[44:10] let's do that or uh let's not you know
[44:14] in many many places it says uh you know
[44:17] for you to not to do certain things then
[44:19] it says let's provoke one another to
[44:21] love it let's do something it ties us up
[44:24] to something amen to a decision that's
[44:27] been made
[44:28] all right so this word let's ties us to
[44:31] a decision that's been made you're not
[44:33] in limbo anymore you're not thinking
[44:35] well am i going to do isn't this or am i
[44:37] how many knows that's a terrible place
[44:38] to be
[44:39] you know you know it's not really a good
[44:42] place where you really don't know which
[44:44] direction that you're going to go what
[44:46] you're going to do
[44:47] right but when they said let's
[44:51] how many the decision had been made a
[44:53] decision had been made they're going to
[44:55] do something
[44:56] something's fixing to happen when
[44:58] somebody is fixing the
[45:00] when that word let come on let's let it
[45:02] be done amen so i've tied it even that
[45:05] word kind of to me it ties in with and
[45:07] it's just me but it ties in with the
[45:09] word amen
[45:10] [Music]
[45:13] amen amen how many knows that what amen
[45:17] means what
[45:18] sophia and the kings used to say so let
[45:22] it be done all right so let it be
[45:25] written
[45:26] so let it be done amen
[45:28] sophia
[45:30] amen so you say amen it's the finality
[45:32] it's something that's
[45:34] rock solid it's something that's sure am
[45:36] it
[45:37] so we look at that word and it has in
[45:39] all the way to me it says so it's an
[45:41] absolute we know that god's word is an
[45:43] absolute
[45:44] amen and i believe that's i believe it's
[45:46] time and even our prophet talked about
[45:48] how that in the age that we're living in
[45:51] and now that jesus has come and done
[45:53] what he did
[45:54] he says the decision is forced upon
[45:57] people in other words you have to make a
[45:59] choice
[46:00] in other words you have to make a
[46:01] judgment it is this christ is not christ
[46:04] just what is it
[46:06] the degeneration was forced to make a
[46:09] decision
[46:11] amen are you gonna believe it or are you
[46:13] not gonna believe it
[46:15] amen but i like it because listen it
[46:18] shows something
[46:19] a forward motion that something's
[46:21] happening amen now here amen god invites
[46:25] us let's read it let us
[46:28] i like the word us
[46:31] you know because it's more than one how
[46:33] many just likes to be all alone
[46:36] i don't know anybody likes to be all
[46:37] alone and i think when it comes to this
[46:39] us
[46:40] it's a particular
[46:43] group of people
[46:45] it can be one more or it can be a
[46:47] thousand more it's us
[46:49] us can apply to one or a thousand and
[46:52] how many knows that when there's one
[46:53] that can chase a thousand then two can
[46:56] chase ten thousand
[46:58] right it's strength how many knows when
[47:00] there's one of us it's a certain strike
[47:03] when there's two of us there's more
[47:05] strength
[47:08] and what about a three-fourth cove
[47:11] three-fold cord
[47:14] how many knows the three-fold cord is
[47:19] not easily broken
[47:21] it's not easily broken so the more that
[47:24] you have the more strength you have but
[47:26] it talks about you know he says let him
[47:29] that cometh let it land whosoever will
[47:31] let him that come you know let him come
[47:34] but here when he talks about us he's
[47:35] talking about more than one person and
[47:37] we're just going to go through some
[47:38] scriptures tonight with the help of the
[47:39] lord and some of the scriptures that he
[47:41] talks about the new testament about let
[47:43] us as a group of people
[47:48] amen
[47:50] that's what we have tonight right we got
[47:51] a group of people
[47:53] let us
[47:56] amen let's do something
[47:58] amen let us
[48:01] you know because somebody knows that god
[48:03] says that let us reason together and the
[48:06] bible talks another place and i'll just
[48:08] read one more scripture to try to bring
[48:10] out what i want to say here
[48:13] but in hebrews
[48:15] the 12th chapter it says wherefore
[48:17] seeing
[48:18] we are also
[48:20] compassed about with
[48:22] witness
[48:23] let us
[48:25] lay aside every weight and the sin which
[48:27] does so easily beset us and let us
[48:30] run with patience success the race has
[48:32] set before us
[48:34] amen i say that this generation and
[48:36] every individual watch as a group we
[48:38] need to have a conference with god we
[48:40] need to have a good fashion talk
[48:42] old-fashioned talk with god amen because
[48:46] we are running a race how much we're
[48:47] running a race
[48:49] and you better you better have some
[48:52] wisdom about you to go through this
[48:54] life's journey
[48:57] amen
[48:59] i'm going to slow down here a little bit
[49:02] you know i was driving
[49:05] i was driving up north to junior's land
[49:07] the other day
[49:08] and uh
[49:09] here comes a funeral procession right
[49:12] and uh
[49:16] of course you pull over to the side
[49:17] right you're respectful and you know you
[49:19] go down through there and you're sitting
[49:20] there and
[49:23] you you know you think a little bit i
[49:25] thought you know you know you're
[49:27] sold another 10 15 years if you lived
[49:30] through all of that
[49:31] they're going to have a funeral
[49:32] procession for you
[49:35] i thought man that's scary i don't care
[49:37] who you are
[49:41] you know because my by the day was my
[49:43] 50s it went really fast if my 60s go
[49:45] that fast you know you better be
[49:47] thinking about your funeral procession
[49:50] right
[49:51] you better think about it because it
[49:52] ain't going to be long folks how many
[49:53] knows you don't have no you don't have
[49:55] no promise of making there's a lot of
[49:57] our friends people sitting here didn't
[49:58] make it through the 50s cancer and
[50:00] everything else
[50:02] we have no problems to make it 360. we
[50:04] have no promise of making in another
[50:05] decade
[50:07] so you better look at what you're doing
[50:08] we better i want to run this race
[50:12] amen looking to the author and the
[50:15] finisher of our faith
[50:17] if we're going to do something i like
[50:19] let us do this and let us not do that
[50:22] amen because it shows that there's
[50:24] something that you and i are supposed to
[50:26] do now
[50:27] because how many knows that god has
[50:29] already done his part
[50:32] this this brings out to me that god has
[50:35] already done his part when he said it is
[50:37] finished on calvary the work was done
[50:39] brother branham kevin said if jesus was
[50:41] standing right here
[50:44] in my suit
[50:46] and he was
[50:48] i believe he's filled with the holy
[50:49] ghost he was standing in his suit
[50:53] there's not anything that he could do
[50:54] for you
[50:56] you might say oh he owe me jesus email
[50:59] me jesus what did brother man say that
[51:00] he would say
[51:02] he says i can't
[51:05] i can't
[51:06] because i already did
[51:09] huh because so how many believes that
[51:11] god has already done his now let us
[51:14] do our part how many is with me now
[51:17] let's do our part now it's up to us
[51:21] what will we do what choice will we make
[51:24] i love it because you know it's glorious
[51:26] when somebody makes a choice makes a
[51:28] decision
[51:30] make a decision everybody has to make a
[51:33] decision sooner or later right
[51:35] i like it
[51:36] and and and on this place in this
[51:39] plateau in this place of decision before
[51:41] you can say well
[51:43] let's do this before you can say that
[51:45] you have to decide what you're going to
[51:47] do
[51:48] i mean as you don't just go do stuff
[51:49] without thinking about it
[51:51] without praying about it
[51:54] and also it's the most critical most
[51:57] crucial
[51:58] craziest place on earth
[52:03] that's right
[52:05] because how many has heard uh
[52:07] about this young abby girl that's just
[52:09] you know they're looking for everywhere
[52:11] and a boyfriend and all the little
[52:12] journey that went on to and she's been
[52:14] murdered
[52:15] somebody had to make a choice to do that
[52:19] you know when they had their fights and
[52:21] their buses and everything else he had
[52:22] to make a choice that's why it's a crazy
[52:24] place
[52:26] it's a crazy place it's a very dangerous
[52:28] place
[52:29] amen because
[52:30] and it's also on the opposite side of
[52:33] the coin it's also the greatest place
[52:35] you can imagine if the right decision is
[52:38] made
[52:39] if the right choice is made
[52:44] you go in the right direction
[52:46] and you decide to do the right thing
[52:49] it's a glorious place because it'll
[52:51] bring peace in your mind
[52:53] folks i was thinking about the other day
[52:55] he says you know you don't know how much
[52:57] it's worth for you to have
[52:59] peace
[53:00] in your mind
[53:03] and peace in your heart
[53:05] and peace
[53:06] in your soul
[53:08] and you can only have that through
[53:11] christ
[53:12] by the holy ghost that's the only place
[53:14] you can have peace like a river peace
[53:16] like a river or you'll have absolute
[53:19] hell
[53:20] in your mind and in your life
[53:23] if you make the wrong choice if you go
[53:25] the wrong
[53:26] way jesus said one place he said let not
[53:30] your heart be troubled
[53:32] you believe in god you believe in me
[53:34] amen
[53:35] i came to give you peace he says so you
[53:37] said in a couple places let not your
[53:39] heart be troubled neither let it be
[53:42] afraid
[53:45] amen i like that don't let it be afraid
[53:47] don't let it do that amen
[53:49] and you can only do that through christ
[53:51] jesus
[53:53] amen so we see here let's just go on
[53:56] here because i believe that it's a time
[53:57] but in sisters that you and i we are
[53:59] reaching for higher heights
[54:02] is that right
[54:03] deeper depth
[54:05] well how does that song go it just comes
[54:06] from a higher higher still amen and
[54:10] deeper
[54:11] higher deeper in the love of jesus
[54:15] praise the lord and you have to make a
[54:17] choice
[54:18] that you're going to go in that
[54:18] direction when we talk as a group as we
[54:21] talk as a church group here amen we want
[54:24] to say look let us paul was saying let
[54:27] us
[54:29] in other places he says to the saints in
[54:31] our philippi to the saints and they're
[54:33] here i believe here that he wasn't
[54:35] talking about amen the sinners i believe
[54:38] he's talking to believers don't you
[54:40] he was talking the people had already
[54:42] begun to race who had been born again
[54:45] and he's trying to say look let us go
[54:47] let's
[54:50] run let's finish this the right way
[54:54] are you with me tonight
[54:56] let's finish let's do this
[54:59] let's run this race let's finish this
[55:01] course
[55:02] let's lay aside every weight
[55:07] because what does that weight do
[55:09] what does that sin do
[55:12] that so easily drags you
[55:15] down
[55:18] how many knows it's so easy to get your
[55:19] mind off somewhere else by the time
[55:21] sunday night amen by sunday come come
[55:23] wednesday night or whatever
[55:25] you have this weight on you again
[55:28] it's hard for
[55:29] you to sing hard for you to praise god
[55:33] paul said let's lay aside every way let
[55:35] us lay aside every weight every sin that
[55:37] does so easily beside us
[55:40] so that we can run this race
[55:42] with patience the race that set before
[55:45] us
[55:46] because he said look see look at all the
[55:48] witnesses
[55:50] that we are compass with
[55:53] we won't go into that because i want to
[55:54] talk about some of these things the
[55:56] scripture talk about that we're to do
[55:59] amen
[56:00] but we see how that are the witnesses
[56:02] they have so many have done it
[56:05] amen
[56:08] all right so he says let us run this
[56:10] with patience that said before looking
[56:12] unto jesus the author and the finisher
[56:14] of our faith who was set down for the
[56:16] joy of set before him endured the cross
[56:18] despising the shame and is set down at
[56:21] the right hand of
[56:23] almighty
[56:24] god
[56:25] so brothers and sisters i'm here to say
[56:28] let us run and let us lay aside
[56:32] anything
[56:35] that hurts your relationship with the
[56:36] lord jesus christ
[56:39] anything
[56:41] your christian walk
[56:46] i heard brother branstad what the other
[56:48] day he was preaching he said you know i
[56:49] don't care how big how strong how much
[56:50] skiller you are how much of a he-man you
[56:52] are whatever make me think of arnold
[56:54] schwarzenegger and
[56:55] and some of them big movie stars or
[56:57] whatever look at him today he says he's
[57:00] one of these days probably god says you
[57:01] want to these days you'll frill
[57:05] up and die
[57:06] [Applause]
[57:07] that's exactly what they're doing
[57:09] they're traveling up and they're gonna
[57:10] die
[57:13] here we have no continuing city all of
[57:16] this mortality when you come down to the
[57:18] door of your death it isn't gonna mean
[57:20] anything to you
[57:23] the only thing we have to do is try to
[57:25] make ourselves as comfortable as we can
[57:28] isn't that right
[57:30] with our natural with our money and the
[57:32] things that we do but folks that's not
[57:34] our goal that's not what we're looking
[57:35] at that's not we're focused on
[57:38] amen paul is saying keep your eyes
[57:41] keep your eyes on the race let's finish
[57:43] it
[57:44] amen
[57:46] over another scripture
[57:50] i believe it's in hebrews 6.
[57:56] in hebrews 6 he says therefore
[58:00] amen
[58:01] therefore leaving the principles of the
[58:03] doctrines of christ
[58:05] let us
[58:07] go on
[58:09] unto perfection
[58:11] amen
[58:13] let us
[58:15] go on unto perfection not laying again
[58:17] the foundation of repentance of dead
[58:19] works
[58:20] and a faith towards god in other words
[58:23] you shouldn't have to be repenting all
[58:25] the time
[58:26] oh i gotta repent again i gotta repent
[58:28] again we gotta no we wanna come up a
[58:30] little higher we don't wanna keep laying
[58:32] the foundation all the time we wanna
[58:34] build on higher things isn't that right
[58:38] amen praise the lord i'm glad to be
[58:41] higher than that aren't you
[58:43] yeah yeah a lot of i thought about this
[58:46] you know let's not make the mistakes
[58:47] that we have made in the past
[58:50] or our parents have made in the past or
[58:52] our friends or relatives have made in
[58:54] the past
[58:56] or we have made in the past

[59:57] how many believes in going forward let
[1:00:00] us go on
[1:00:02] unto perfection
[1:00:04] over in philippians is another one
[1:00:08] in philippians
[1:00:11] 3
[1:00:18] and verse 12 paul says
[1:00:22] not as though i had already attained
[1:00:25] either were already perfect so paul says
[1:00:28] i'm not even perfect
[1:00:30] but i follow after
[1:00:33] if that i may apprehend
[1:00:36] that for which i also am apprehended
[1:00:39] of jesus christ
[1:00:41] brother i count not myself to have
[1:00:44] apprehended but there's one thing i do
[1:00:47] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:00:53] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:00:55] which are before
[1:00:59] hello
[1:01:00] how many knows brother bam said that for
[1:01:03] the unbeliever the worst nightmares you
[1:01:05] could ever imagine is the worst time
[1:01:06] ever for the unbeliever out there
[1:01:09] there is no forward there is no future
[1:01:12] for the unbeliever
[1:01:15] but for us what's before
[1:01:18] i'll tell you i was coming to church
[1:01:19] tonight and i thought you know the less
[1:01:21] i would think of the politics and
[1:01:23] everything that's just kind of it needs
[1:01:24] to just kind of fade away
[1:01:27] you know just don't worry about that
[1:01:29] anymore
[1:01:30] don't worry don't worry it's not going
[1:01:32] to get any better
[1:01:34] right so don't worry just don't worry
[1:01:35] about focus on what's ahead for us
[1:01:39] that's what paul's saying here look at
[1:01:41] what's ahead for us
[1:01:45] look what's past that last breath
[1:01:48] i mean i don't look at the funeral
[1:01:50] position i look at that last breath and
[1:01:52] what's over on that other side saying
[1:01:55] lord i know that it's you know it's a
[1:01:57] terrible river to have to cross but with
[1:01:59] christ it don't have to be so terrible
[1:02:02] i'm
[1:02:03] thankful that i have somebody that
[1:02:04] across should help me cross that river
[1:02:07] amen
[1:02:09] praise the lord
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:14] all right
[1:02:15] i'll i have something that happened
[1:02:17] funny but i'm not here to tell jokes
[1:02:19] maybe some
[1:02:20] time i'll tell you on the side but i
[1:02:22] told my wife on the way to church but
[1:02:24] anyway
[1:02:25] and that's why i'm kind of grinning
[1:02:26] because of that but anyway so anyway so
[1:02:28] paul says here notice here he says those
[1:02:30] things which are behind but reaching
[1:02:32] forth unto those who are before
[1:02:34] he said for i pressed hearts to mark
[1:02:38] for the prize of the high calling of god
[1:02:43] folks those
[1:02:44] lepers they had
[1:02:46] gold and silver and they went and dug
[1:02:48] them some holes and they had them a good
[1:02:50] time
[1:02:51] but let me tell you something how many
[1:02:52] of us are
[1:02:53] gold is a christ-like character our gold
[1:02:57] is heaven amen
[1:02:59] yeah we decide we have decided like we
[1:03:01] said i have decided to follow jesus
[1:03:04] there's no turning back no turning back
[1:03:07] don't go with me yet still will i follow
[1:03:10] you've made that choice you've made that
[1:03:12] decision you're going with christ no
[1:03:14] matter what
[1:03:16] another place he talks about i believe
[1:03:18] the song says you know if
[1:03:20] my brother don't go
[1:03:22] don't hinder me if my sister don't go
[1:03:24] don't hinder me i'm on my way praise god
[1:03:28] i'm on my way we're pressing towers to
[1:03:30] mark for the prize of the high calling
[1:03:33] of god
[1:03:34] which is what eternal life
[1:03:36] how many knows that's the prize is
[1:03:38] eternal life
[1:03:40] our reward is eternal life
[1:03:44] because if this life is all you have
[1:03:45] folks it's certainly not much not much
[1:03:49] but eternal life high calling in christ
[1:03:52] jesus
[1:03:53] that's our goal let us
[1:03:56] let us therefore
[1:03:59] as many as be perfect
[1:04:02] be thus minded
[1:04:05] amen
[1:04:06] keep your
[1:04:07] mind
[1:04:08] on the end
[1:04:10] think about what you're going to do when
[1:04:12] you come down to the door of death we
[1:04:14] don't know it might linger another 10 15
[1:04:15] years we haven't got a clue
[1:04:18] isn't it something our brother brown
[1:04:19] thought he would be in 77
[1:04:22] but then back later on he says you know
[1:04:23] i don't care i don't know if it's 20
[1:04:25] years 30 years 50 years 100 years a
[1:04:27] thousand i don't know he said
[1:04:30] he didn't know
[1:04:32] because i'll tell you what he certainly
[1:04:33] didn't think we'd be in 2021
[1:04:36] never seen us coming this far
[1:04:40] so what does that do for us who are here
[1:04:43] say lord help me to be ready
[1:04:46] lord help me to be
[1:04:48] ready let us therefore as many as be
[1:04:51] perfect be thus minded and if anything
[1:04:55] the
[1:04:56] uh if there be any other thing
[1:04:58] otherwise might god reveal it to us even
[1:05:01] unto us
[1:05:02] amen jesus said you know how many knows
[1:05:04] jesus said to be
[1:05:06] ready
[1:05:07] for you know not the day nor the hour
[1:05:10] that he is gonna come back we don't know
[1:05:12] when he's gonna come back so i say
[1:05:13] tonight let's
[1:05:15] get ready
[1:05:17] if you're not ready get ready right
[1:05:19] but it's best to be ready let's be ready
[1:05:23] for we don't know
[1:05:25] when he will come

[1:05:34] spent
[1:05:38] the day
[1:05:39] is at hand
[1:05:41] it is the rising of the sun how many
[1:05:42] they say but i'm remembering
[1:05:44] says you know it's just dark it's just
[1:05:47] before the light
[1:05:48] but he said it is
[1:05:50] the rising
[1:05:52] of the sun
[1:05:54] amen how many beliefs is the rising of
[1:05:56] the sun

[1:08:22] we can see that whenever we have have
[1:08:25] that i have love i believe we gotta have

[1:08:29] 13 says let us walk
[1:08:34] honestly
[1:08:36] amen so it says listen we have to let us
[1:08:38] cast off the darkness put on the armor
[1:08:41] of light let us walk honestly as in the
[1:08:44] day not in rioting in drunkenness
[1:08:47] not in chamber chambering and wanting us
[1:08:51] not in strife and enemy amen
[1:08:56] how many believes that
[1:08:58] then also it says romans 14 let us
[1:09:00] therefore
[1:09:02] follow after the things which make for
[1:09:04] peace
[1:09:05] and things wherewith one may
[1:09:08] edify
[1:09:10] another
[1:09:11] how many believes eternal life is living
[1:09:13] for others
[1:09:14] so it says let us follow after the
[1:09:16] things which make for peace and the
[1:09:18] things where one may edify another
[1:09:20] galatian 6 9 says
[1:09:22] let us
[1:09:24] not
[1:09:25] amen
[1:09:28] be
[1:09:29] weary
[1:09:30] in well-doing
[1:09:34] don't get tired of your christian walk
[1:09:37] and serving the lord
[1:09:40] because it says for in due season
[1:09:42] you shall reap
[1:09:44] if we
[1:09:46] faint
[1:09:47] not how many believes it's really
[1:09:49] something you have to work on
[1:09:52] and
[1:09:53] it says as we have
[1:09:56] opportunity let us
[1:09:59] do good unto all men
[1:10:02] especially unto them that are of the
[1:10:04] household
[1:10:06] of
[1:10:07] faith
[1:10:08] how many believes that we all ought to
[1:10:09] always be looking for something in good
[1:10:12] that we can do
[1:10:14] for
[1:10:14] one another
[1:10:17] i believe that
[1:10:19] that's what he said look always look for
[1:10:21] an opportunity
[1:10:23] to do something good one for another
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:31] so listen but ye brethren are not in
[1:10:33] darkness that that they should overtake
[1:10:35] you as a thief ye are all the children
[1:10:38] of the light and the children of the day
[1:10:41] we are not of the darkness
[1:10:44] therefore
[1:10:45] let us
[1:10:47] not
[1:10:48] sleep
[1:10:50] amen
[1:10:52] now how many knows
[1:10:54] even the prophet of god says you know
[1:10:55] wake up pentecost wake up churches wake
[1:10:58] up people wake up
[1:11:00] why because they were spiritually
[1:11:05] huh they were spiritually sleeping
[1:11:09] not aware of what's really going on
[1:11:12] too caught up with the things of the
[1:11:13] world the things of the world will make
[1:11:15] you droggy
[1:11:17] it'll make you sleepy
[1:11:19] just the cares of life
[1:11:22] what can make you droggy and sleepy
[1:11:25] before you know it
[1:11:26] you have no fresh revelation anymore
[1:11:30] you don't hear the voice of god that
[1:11:31] sweetness isn't there anymore because
[1:11:33] you're so busy taking care of things
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:38] so it says don't sleep amen we're not
[1:11:40] children of the night but we're children
[1:11:42] of the day
[1:11:44] but
[1:11:44] let us not sleep as do others but let us
[1:11:47] watch
[1:11:49] and
[1:11:50] be
[1:11:51] soper amen
[1:11:54] first timothy 6 6 says but godliness
[1:11:57] with contentment
[1:11:59] is great gain
[1:12:01] for we brought
[1:12:02] nothing into this world and is certainly
[1:12:06] and it is certain that we can carry
[1:12:09] nothing out
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:14] you came into this world naked
[1:12:17] you'll leave
[1:12:18] with a suit of clothes
[1:12:20] and probably your shoes off i don't
[1:12:22] think they put shoes on people
[1:12:24] you might have socks
[1:12:26] pair of pants suit coat your hair
[1:12:31] that's what you get to take with you
[1:12:35] getting stuff right but that's what you
[1:12:37] get to take with you
[1:12:40] outside of christ but with christ you
[1:12:42] have something that's eternal and i'm
[1:12:43] glad for that let's say thank you lord
[1:12:45] jesus for giving me something more than
[1:12:48] a pair of socks a pair of clothes to
[1:12:50] take with me i can take something that's
[1:12:52] eternal
[1:12:53] of eternal weight amen
[1:12:56] but it says paul says tells us to be
[1:12:58] content with such things that we have
[1:13:01] and having food and raiment
[1:13:05] let us
[1:13:06] be
[1:13:07] there with
[1:13:09] content
[1:13:11] content
[1:13:13] isn't that a sweet word
[1:13:15] content
[1:13:17] happy
[1:13:20] not a baby screaming and hollering
[1:13:24] but a baby on a bottle on mama's breast
[1:13:30] as happiness can be content contentment
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:35] how many believes that's what it ought
[1:13:37] to be
[1:13:38] and
[1:13:39] listen also
[1:13:41] let us hold fast
[1:13:43] our profession
[1:13:45] of faith without
[1:13:47] wavering
[1:13:49] for he is faithful that promised
[1:13:52] and let us
[1:13:54] consider one another
[1:13:56] how many beliefs we need to can be
[1:13:58] considerate of one another hey you
[1:14:00] wouldn't have to he could say you know
[1:14:02] it would be a different word but let us
[1:14:03] as a group
[1:14:05] when you have more than one you always
[1:14:07] have to be considerate of the other
[1:14:09] person right
[1:14:10] we who are married have learned that if
[1:14:12] you haven't you're still in for a really
[1:14:14] really strong lesson
[1:14:19] yeah if you haven't learned that already
[1:14:22] how to be considerate of your wife or of
[1:14:23] your husband
[1:14:25] amen
[1:14:28] now notice let us consider one another
[1:14:31] and i like this word to provoke
[1:14:36] huh
[1:14:37] provoke now i don't know the exact i
[1:14:40] didn't look up the meaning but
[1:14:42] irritate perhaps or
[1:14:46] prod
[1:14:47] or push
[1:14:48] we know that when you provoke somebody
[1:14:50] to anger well we know what you're what
[1:14:52] that's all about right
[1:14:54] but this is let us provoke one another
[1:14:58] unto love
[1:15:00] and good works
[1:15:03] huh
[1:15:04] somebody does something maybe a little
[1:15:06] now brother you know you shouldn't do
[1:15:08] that now you know you shouldn't have
[1:15:09] scolded them or you know you should have
[1:15:12] been considered provoke one another to
[1:15:14] love
[1:15:15] push one another to love and to good
[1:15:18] works that right that's what paul said
[1:15:21] that we were to provoke one another to
[1:15:24] love and to
[1:15:25] good works
[1:15:27] amen last of all
[1:15:31] let us
