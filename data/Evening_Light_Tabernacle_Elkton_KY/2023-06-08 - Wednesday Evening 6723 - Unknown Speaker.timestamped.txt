[26:16] before the Lord in prayer father we come
[26:17] before you Lord Jesus we want to thank
[26:20] you Lord for one other wonderful day
[26:21] that you have given us Lord we thank you
[26:23] for all the good things that you have
[26:25] bestowed upon us Lord realizing God when
[26:27] we think back lord if our forefathers
[26:30] and the different ones back in the early
[26:32] 900
[26:33] 1900s Lord and we think of how people
[26:36] used to have it really really bad and
[26:38] rough we think sometimes we have it bad
[26:40] but we really don't in comparison so
[26:42] Lord help us to be thankful and grateful
[26:44] father for how good you are to us Lord
[26:46] and father to think also Lord Jesus of
[26:48] when we was in confusion and people
[26:50] still out there in darkness and in
[26:52] confusion spiritually not knowing where
[26:54] they are Lord you have brought the light
[26:56] of your father so that we can understand
[26:58] these things better father we ask God as
[27:01] we have assembled ourselves together
[27:02] Lord and come into those double doors
[27:05] Lord Jesus we ask God that you'd help
[27:06] each and every one of us not to go out
[27:08] the same Lord but to go out better than
[27:10] what we've come Lord not to be on the
[27:13] same condition as what we was when we
[27:15] came in Lord we ask your blessing upon
[27:17] the reading of the word the meditation
[27:18] of our heart and ask God that you just
[27:20] bring the inspiration now and help me
[27:22] say just what you want me to say and
[27:24] keep my mouth from saying anything Lord
[27:26] that where you wouldn't once said father
[27:27] let it be a blessing and edify the body
[27:31] of Christ for we ask it in the
[27:33] all-sufficient name of the Lord Jesus
[27:34] Christ amen and amen amen
[27:39] if you will turn your Bibles amen we
[27:41] want to amen kind of go this is kind of
[27:43] one of those things where uh you know
[27:47] it's the same word of God same
[27:50] scriptures and all but it'll be
[27:52] something that I I just feel like
[27:54] perhaps maybe you know getting my age
[27:57] sometimes I think it's new maybe maybe
[28:00] it is maybe I've spoken on it before but
[28:02] anyway I don't think I have amen so amen
[28:06] it's kind of just something other
[28:07] something a little bit different angle
[28:09] perhaps I mean than what we're used to
[28:11] amen or or have seen maybe we can see it
[28:14] just a little bit different amen
[28:17] amen so I think we want to go to the
[28:19] Book of Matthew let's go to Matthew
[28:22] first
[28:24] amen just do a little lesson tonight
[28:27] with the help of the Lord the word of
[28:29] God Amen and the power of the word and
[28:32] how we can see the word amen in its full
[28:37] strength Amen in its full power amen and
[28:41] so I just want to read
[28:45] um in the 13th chapter of Matthew
[28:48] 1 through 9 and then I want to go to
[28:52] verse 18 to 23 of the same chapter it is
[28:56] the story or should we say the parable
[28:58] of the sower that went forth to sow
[29:02] verse 1. the same day when Jesus went
[29:06] Jesus out of the house and sat by the
[29:09] seaside and the great multitude were
[29:11] gathered together unto him so that he
[29:13] went into his ship and sat and whole
[29:16] multitude stood on the shore
[29:18] and he spoke many things unto them in
[29:21] Parables saying behold A sower went
[29:23] forth to sow and when he sowed some
[29:26] seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls
[29:30] came and devoured them up some fell upon
[29:33] Stony places where they had not much
[29:36] Earth and forth with they sprung up
[29:39] because they had not much deepness of
[29:41] Earth and when the sun was up they were
[29:45] scorched and because that they had no
[29:47] root they withered away then some fell
[29:50] among thorns and Thorns sprang up and
[29:52] choked them but other fell on into good
[29:55] ground and brought forth fruit and some
[29:58] 100 fold and some 60 and and some 30. he
[30:03] who has an ears to hear Let Him hear
[30:06] amen isn't it something that he said
[30:08] that but yet he had told him that he
[30:10] speak
[30:11] spoke to a lot of them in Parables
[30:13] showing that they seeing would not see
[30:16] him ears would not hear neither would
[30:18] they understand amen it takes the Holy
[30:21] Spirit to really reveal it now in verse
[30:23] 19 of the same chapter he begins to
[30:27] explain it verse 18. he hear ye
[30:31] therefore the parable of the sower when
[30:33] anyone Hearth the word of the Kingdom
[30:36] amen how many believes that's the word
[30:38] of God is that right the Bible one here
[30:41] is an understandeth it not
[30:44] then cometh the wicked one and catches
[30:46] away that which is sown in his heart
[30:49] this is he which received seed by the
[30:52] wayside
[30:54] but he that received the sea seed on
[30:56] Stony ground places the same you see
[30:58] that heareth the word and annoy with joy
[31:01] receiveth it
[31:02] yet he had not root in himself but do
[31:06] Earth for a while
[31:07] forming tribulation or persecution
[31:10] arises because of the word by and by He
[31:15] Is offended
[31:16] he also with received seed among the
[31:18] thorns and see that heareth the word and
[31:21] the cares of this world the world and
[31:24] the deceitfulness of riches choked the
[31:27] word and he becometh unfruitful
[31:31] but he that receive a seed in the good
[31:33] ground to see that heareth the word and
[31:35] understandeth it which also bears fruit
[31:37] and bringeth forth some 100 fold some 60
[31:40] and some 30. may God add His blessings
[31:43] to reading in the words you can be
[31:44] seated tonight
[31:46] amen so we see here brothers and sisters
[31:48] that you know uh and and we speak so
[31:52] much and we do believe that whenever God
[31:54] sends forth his word Tommy believes it
[31:56] when God sends forth his word and when
[31:59] he speaks something it says that it will
[32:01] not return to him void amen it's Eternal
[32:04] in the heavens and it can't pass away
[32:06] and so forth and all of God promises
[32:08] that way but I want to look at something
[32:10] a little bit uh perhaps in a little bit
[32:12] different light and there's a whole
[32:14] world of uh whole message basically that
[32:16] we could preach on on the unconditional
[32:19] Covenant that Abraham had with God that
[32:22] God saved Abraham unconditionally isn't
[32:24] that right and so forth but tonight we
[32:27] want to speak on conditions conditions
[32:31] amen
[32:32] as you can see by the word of God that
[32:36] there were certain conditions isn't that
[32:38] right that the word fell into and it
[32:41] only brought forth a little or or it
[32:44] only sprung up so far it really didn't
[32:46] it doesn't sound like it really achieved
[32:49] what it was supposed to do isn't that
[32:50] right
[32:51] amen and so that that's true you know
[32:54] and that's the way it is and you know
[32:57] and ultimately we find that
[33:00] um
[33:01] you don't want to save that comment for
[33:03] later but anyway we find here that
[33:05] there's all these different different
[33:06] conditions that it falls on and on and
[33:09] and even Jesus said to uh I believe it
[33:12] was the Pharisees he says you know you
[33:15] by your Traditions have made the word of
[33:18] God of none effect to the people
[33:22] and we have to say that you know even
[33:24] though the word of God I mean every last
[33:26] word is true and every promise is right
[33:29] but yet most people do not benefit from
[33:33] it do they
[33:34] they never really reap the benefits of
[33:37] the word of God we want to tonight look
[33:39] at the conditions amen of reaping the
[33:42] full benefits of the word of God because
[33:45] notice he says that he wants us to bring
[33:47] forth fruit now let's talk about
[33:50] conditions I wanna I wanna I wanna I
[33:52] wanna name a bunch of conditions
[33:55] amen that there that comes with the word
[33:58] of God we're going to say that there's a
[33:59] bunch of conditions because I heard a
[34:01] preacher one say I don't give his word
[34:02] with conditions
[34:04] there's no conditions with his word I
[34:06] just didn't quite agree with it
[34:09] amen
[34:10] because there's conditions
[34:12] amen
[34:14] so one of the conditions I want to talk
[34:17] about of course is
[34:19] um
[34:20] one of the conditions is you have to be
[34:22] hungry
[34:23] hunger Hunger is a condition
[34:27] that right
[34:29] thirst is a condition
[34:32] right to come it's a condition
[34:36] whosoever
[34:37] will
[34:39] is a condition
[34:42] if
[34:43] the word if is a major
[34:45] condition
[34:47] remember
[34:48] when that one came to him and wanted
[34:50] healing for his daughter I believe it
[34:52] was and
[34:54] you know he says if thou if thou can't
[34:57] believe how many times did Jesus if
[35:01] thou can't believe that's the condition
[35:05] if you can
[35:07] amen
[35:09] if you can so we got the word if we'll
[35:12] get cover that a little bit and so forth
[35:13] amen another one is repent another one
[35:16] is water amen you know and so forth
[35:21] of course faith if thou can't belief
[35:23] faith is of course one of the major
[35:25] conditions you got to have faith to
[35:26] believe it I heard brother bam talking
[35:28] about faith and he says you know if you
[35:30] could just believe for anything
[35:33] ask anything just believe anything if
[35:35] you could really have faith for that
[35:38] what kind of world would it be
[35:40] what kind of world would you live in if
[35:41] you could just ask anything because the
[35:43] Bible says if you can believe it even if
[35:46] you have faith and don't doubt you'll
[35:48] have it
[35:49] but brother bam says he makes a
[35:51] statement he says you know the Holy
[35:52] Ghost
[35:53] won't give you faith
[35:55] to believe something that is according
[35:57] his word
[35:58] or according to his will
[36:01] isn't that right or according to his
[36:03] will the Holy Ghost won't so whatever
[36:05] Faith you have is just mental faith it
[36:07] ain't your faith is God's requiring
[36:10] amen
[36:11] so and I you know I thought about that
[36:13] because I know that we're saved
[36:15] unconditional God's going to save us and
[36:16] so forth but I want to say that even for
[36:19] us believer even for us Believers the
[36:22] word of God is on condition
[36:25] it's on condition
[36:27] all right I just want to start with
[36:28] saying that
[36:30] all right
[36:32] let's start with the first condition
[36:34] let's go all the way to the Book of
[36:35] Revelation
[36:36] let's look at this here first
[36:40] amen I'm sure we all could say tonight I
[36:42] want more of God
[36:44] I want more of the spirit well there's
[36:46] got to be more there
[36:47] you know but what what is what what's
[36:50] got to be there what Scott to be there
[36:52] if you're ever going to get more
[36:54] there has to be a deep calling right a
[36:57] deep calling to the Deep amen
[37:02] Revelation is 22 here's the first thing
[37:05] I want to talk about
[37:06] in Revelations the very end of the
[37:08] chapter
[37:11] how many remembers Jesus said whosoever
[37:13] will let him come in Iraq and the spirit
[37:16] verse 17 and the spirit and the bride
[37:19] say come and let him that heareth say
[37:23] come and let him that is
[37:27] read it with me a thirst
[37:30] come so there's your condition you'll
[37:33] never come right unless you're thirsty
[37:37] so that's why I said the condition is
[37:38] that you've got to get thirsty
[37:44] before you get anything from God you're
[37:46] going to have to get thirsty
[37:48] amen
[37:49] all right
[37:50] and
[37:52] and
[37:53] whosoever will right let him take of the
[37:59] Water of Life freely now how many means
[38:03] that that's what this is this is the
[38:06] Water of Life
[38:07] this is the bread of life this is the
[38:10] Tree of Life
[38:12] and the Bible says if whoever wilts
[38:16] now how many knows whosoever will let
[38:18] him come
[38:19] that no uh John 3 16 for God so loved
[38:22] the world that whosoever Shall Believe
[38:23] in him should not there should
[38:25] everlasting life
[38:26] whosoever will and that will is right in
[38:30] there because people just don't really
[38:32] want it that's the problem
[38:36] because if that will was there for
[38:38] everybody everybody would be saved
[38:40] everybody gets saved if the will was
[38:43] there
[38:44] that's a big statement ain't it
[38:47] the whole world would get saved if the
[38:50] will was there Cain would have got saved
[38:53] if the will would have been there God
[38:54] made him the offer do like your brother
[38:56] and you'll be accepted did he want to he
[38:59] had not the will
[39:01] the Pharisees that have been saved if
[39:03] they had the will but they don't have
[39:05] the will
[39:06] oh
[39:07] [Music]
[39:10] Glory how much more I got a revelation
[39:13] of this body when I got to thinking
[39:14] about this God put it in such a way that
[39:17] this Bible is really just for believers
[39:21] they're not like it's really just for
[39:23] the Believers or real Believers the only
[39:25] one that's really going to just will
[39:28] he's the one that's gonna be thirsty
[39:31] he's the one that's gonna be hungry
[39:34] the others ain't hungry they're not
[39:36] thirsty so it's there for you
[39:45] pray pray be to God think about here's
[39:47] another one Matthew 5 there's so many
[39:50] things but blessed are the poor spirit
[39:52] and so forth but blessed Jesus said
[39:54] blessed are they which do hunger
[39:59] and thirst
[40:02] blessed are they for what does it say
[40:05] for they shall be failed
[40:10] Hallelujah
[40:15] oh my think about it
[40:18] oh my let me go back a little bit go
[40:21] back to the other thought well
[40:22] you know people say well I want to I
[40:24] want to
[40:25] I want to be Christian people come up
[40:27] developer perhaps
[40:29] but the question is how much do you want
[40:31] to
[40:32] how many knows that God knows how much
[40:34] you really want to
[40:37] are you really are you if you really
[40:39] will then you have to come with all the
[40:42] other ones you know what the other ones
[40:43] is Jesus said unless the person is
[40:46] willing to forsake all to follow me is
[40:49] that worthy of me
[40:51] so are you sure you want to do all that
[40:53] yeah for a sec oh it don't matter
[40:57] if you're married and your husband or
[41:01] your wife isn't going to come when you
[41:03] come guess what she might divorce you
[41:05] might put you away but that's what you
[41:06] got to be willing to do
[41:11] if Jesus said man those who have
[41:14] forsaken houses and lands and wives and
[41:16] children for my sake huh the same shall
[41:18] be saved
[41:19] so that will God knows and just the same
[41:22] with the Holy Ghost people will say well
[41:24] I tried and I tried and I tried I tried
[41:26] even better man said he said you know
[41:28] there's there's people that have tried
[41:30] to get the Holy Ghost and it just seems
[41:31] like people can manifest the word of God
[41:33] and others man you just can't do it huh
[41:39] isn't that how it is sometimes
[41:43] let me just read it his word is always
[41:45] what he wants to see Vindicated and
[41:48] it'll only be Vindicated upon certain
[41:50] conditions this is accepting God's way
[41:53] 1963. that's when you meet those
[41:56] conditions and you see people that can
[41:58] take the word of God and just make it
[42:00] live for them and others come right back
[42:03] with the same word and they can't do
[42:05] nothing with it it's on conditions
[42:15] whoa
[42:16] praise be to God
[42:18] can I read you some more again he says
[42:21] on the next quote it's on conditions
[42:23] absolutely you can have Divine Healing
[42:26] you can have salvation you can have the
[42:28] baptism in all he goes but that's on
[42:31] conditions
[42:33] that you meet God's conditions
[42:38] outside of that it's not for nobody but
[42:41] Believers
[42:43] that's about the right that's why we say
[42:46] that this is really a love letter to his
[42:48] church
[42:49] that's
[42:50] why all of these conditions we're
[42:52] talking about it it doesn't really apply
[42:54] to the unbeliever they'll never meet
[42:56] those conditions
[42:58] and if you meet those conditions if you
[43:01] will or if you are a thirst
[43:03] you blessed person if you want more of
[43:06] God if you want more of the holy God you
[43:07] are a blessed person
[43:10] that's why you guys say you're blessed
[43:12] if you're hungry and thirsty
[43:15] you want more God you're a blessed
[43:17] person
[43:18] because those people they're happy
[43:19] wherever they are whatever they're doing
[43:21] I'm not happy until I'm doing what God
[43:24] wants me to do
[43:26] together
[43:28] I'm not happy until I'm in the perfect
[43:30] will of God
[43:35] oh my
[43:37] I'm thirsty
[43:40] I mean these thirsts is another
[43:42] condition you got to be thirsty
[43:45] isn't that something could have said
[43:47] anything but he said let him that's a
[43:49] thirst
[43:50] come
[43:52] anybody that's thirsty come on
[43:55] come and drink of the Waters of Life
[43:58] freely
[44:01] amen takes me back to David
[44:04] isn't it something how David was
[44:07] a renowned person he was carnal he did a
[44:10] lot of bad things because of his flesh
[44:12] and lack of the Holy Ghost
[44:13] don't we all when we ain't got the Holy
[44:16] Ghost like we ought to
[44:17] David did but there was something else
[44:19] about David that God really liked
[44:22] and David was a consecrated man to God
[44:24] he'd repent that he's wrong and so forth
[44:26] and you know
[44:28] he had it his heart said on God and in
[44:32] Psalm 63 and 1 he says oh God Thou Art
[44:35] my God early will I seek thee
[44:38] amen praise the Lord oh my God let me
[44:42] just add this in how many knows and
[44:44] another condition amen of receiving God
[44:46] is that you seek God you might think I'm
[44:48] you know you're seeking God that's
[44:50] actually God working that's the grace of
[44:52] God pulling on you
[44:55] seek and you shall find hello no
[45:02] not giving unto you
[45:04] only will I seek thee my soul thirsts
[45:07] just for thee my flesh long for thee as
[45:11] the in a dry and thirsty land
[45:17] boil boy we can sure say that this place
[45:20] around here it's Troy this world is dry

[46:01] if you come to church Thursday you'll
[46:02] say oh let me jump some of that down

[46:15] that's right we love to come on

[46:42] Glory
[46:44] so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary
[46:49] oh my
[46:50] that's what we hunger and thirst for is
[46:52] to see the power of God don't we
[46:55] power of God in your life
[46:58] power of God in my life to see him do
[47:00] Miracles so when you ask something he
[47:02] answers it
[47:04] don't you just love to be in the place
[47:07] another condition
[47:09] another condition forgetting what you
[47:11] want
[47:13] in Saint John 15 he said
[47:15] if
[47:17] huh if ye abide
[47:21] in me
[47:25] if you abide in me and my word abides in
[47:29] you then you can ask what you will in
[47:32] other words you've got to be right with
[47:34] God
[47:35] Christ has to be there Holy Ghost has to
[47:38] be there he has to be there because he
[47:41] said without me you can't do nothing
[47:44] you ain't getting nothing you ain't
[47:45] doing nothing
[47:47] you ain't gonna be the light of the
[47:49] world you ain't gonna be like to nobody
[47:51] you ain't gonna be your help for nobody
[47:55] talk before we get back flint and when
[47:57] we get sin in our life we get depressed
[47:59] we get down on ourselves and the devil
[48:01] will try to make us men feel bad about
[48:03] ourselves and if you feel bad about
[48:05] yourself everybody else is probably not
[48:07] want to be around you
[48:10] you can't let the devil do that
[48:14] who was it sister Lisa I think it said
[48:16] if he said something about that last
[48:18] time last Sunday in the on the special
[48:20] talking about the devil trying to beat
[48:21] you down
[48:22] I thought boy that's right I won't even
[48:24] give a testimony about it but I'll say
[48:26] it now the devil make you try to feel
[48:28] bad about you if you feel bad about
[48:30] yourself
[48:32] that's a terrible place to be
[48:35] get down on your knees and get right
[48:37] with God and feel good about yourself
[48:39] wear a smile
[48:42] it's so much better
[48:46] it's found
[48:48] so much better
[48:50] you love him
[48:52] that's right if you abide in me and I'm
[48:54] my word if if if if if if if if those
[48:58] are conditions
[49:03] because it's all possible
[49:05] think about it well we allowed to talk
[49:08] we always preach about all things
[49:09] impossible
[49:11] but if thou I can't believe then all
[49:15] things are possible if you can believe
[49:17] but that's the condition
[49:19] and half of the people don't get it weak
[49:21] a lot of times don't get it amen that's
[49:23] right preach it brother because we don't
[49:24] believe the way we should
[49:28] yeah I want to say it again can I better
[49:30] John Wayne
[49:32] that if we don't get what what you know
[49:34] a lot of time we think well God didn't
[49:36] give it to me God didn't give don't you
[49:37] ever blame God
[49:42] you blame yourself
[49:44] because if you blame God you're saying
[49:46] his word ain't true and his word is true
[49:51] he keeps his word
[49:55] when you think well God don't keep me
[49:56] let him just go ahead and show exactly
[49:59] why you didn't get what you wanted
[50:01] what you asked for
[50:03] and that right and you'll say oh boy it
[50:05] wasn't him at all was it
[50:08] amen
[50:09] while we're on that subject there's a
[50:11] scripture for it
[50:13] says it this way
[50:19] well
[50:21] Galatians 4
[50:25] well
[50:30] it's in James no it's in James let's go
[50:33] to James I'll find James here
[50:39] amen
[50:43] James is way back here
[50:46] I need my tabs
[50:56] I stuck it downwards on below
[50:58] all right foot winds comes Wars and
[51:01] fightings among you come there dot hands
[51:03] for even from your own lust that war in
[51:06] your members
[51:07] isn't that the truth yeah all of our
[51:10] lusts and all of our desires and stuff
[51:11] that's where all of our problems come
[51:13] from you lust but you have not you kill
[51:16] you desire to have and you cannot obtain
[51:20] you fight in war
[51:22] that you have not
[51:26] because you asked not
[51:29] you ask and receive not
[51:32] because you ask a miss
[51:36] [Music]
[51:41] it's because the wrong thing
[51:44] my my
[51:47] you ask a miss that you may consume it
[51:49] upon your own lust
[51:53] you adulterers and adulterers know you
[51:55] that the Friendship of the world is
[51:56] inevity with God and whosoever therefore
[51:58] will be a friend of the world is the
[52:01] enemy of God
[52:04] amen
[52:06] what is he saying here a lot of times
[52:07] we've got a load of our own selves in
[52:10] there yet amen still our own ways in
[52:14] there and then we want this and we ask
[52:16] that and we doubt we find we try to get
[52:18] it we don't never get it never get to
[52:20] where we're going
[52:21] never get what we want
[52:23] never we have asked
[52:27] because we ask for the wrong thing
[52:30] I believe it was said whenever brother
[52:31] Brandon was talking about that and how
[52:33] it said that you can't just ask for and
[52:34] he says you got to ask for the will of
[52:36] God
[52:37] you know and when you know that it's
[52:39] according to the will of God then ask
[52:41] and it'll be done
[52:43] amen
[52:44] yes sir
[52:46] praise the Lord you love him
[52:48] back to David again

[53:58] becomes a reality it's called the place
[54:01] of desperation

[54:09] serious about it

[58:24] starved you don't even have any hunger
[58:25] pains

[59:28] word to cry for reaching out in the
[59:31] spirit amen

[1:00:06] thirst you got to have a thirst
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:11] got to be in travail so to speak travail
[1:00:15] foreign
[1:00:21] in travail
[1:00:23] Paul said for we know that the whole
[1:00:25] creation groaneth and travaila in pain
[1:00:30] together until now
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:35] and not only they
[1:00:37] but ourselves also which have the first
[1:00:41] fruits of the spirit
[1:00:45] I mean at least that's what that means
[1:00:46] you got the Holy Ghost
[1:00:48] but you're also travailing you're also
[1:00:52] in pain
[1:00:57] what are we in pain we want to like Paul
[1:00:59] said until Christ is fully formed
[1:01:01] I don't know about you but I mean
[1:01:02] travail
[1:01:04] until the word is fully formed in me
[1:01:07] take this seed take this word Lord let
[1:01:10] it put it in it here
[1:01:13] and let it bring what a hundredfold
[1:01:15] isn't that right isn't that what we want
[1:01:17] to do we want this word to come in their
[1:01:20] lives and to be fruitful because that's
[1:01:22] exactly what Jesus asked in Saint John
[1:01:24] 15 that you bring much for bring forth
[1:01:28] much fruit that's the father's will is
[1:01:31] that you bring forth much fruit
[1:01:35] amen and this is the fruit tree
[1:01:39] praise be to God
[1:01:41] it's like a seed amen
[1:01:45] for we ourselves growing within
[1:01:46] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:01:48] wit the Redemption of our body amen so
[1:01:52] we have to be in travail
[1:01:55] to get what we want you have to travail
[1:01:57] sometimes
[1:01:59] ask
[1:02:00] seek
[1:02:02] and knock thirst
[1:02:04] come
[1:02:07] amen
[1:02:10] now notice
[1:02:12] better man I'm talking about Elijah and
[1:02:14] Elisha
[1:02:16] Elijah turned around
[1:02:20] he says the only thing that he wanted to
[1:02:21] know was
[1:02:23] talking about Elisha it was could he get
[1:02:27] that promise
[1:02:28] that's all he wanted
[1:02:30] and he says now I'm going to ask you or
[1:02:32] tell you what my desire is I want a
[1:02:35] double portion of your spirit to come
[1:02:37] upon me
[1:02:38] now what are you going to say
[1:02:40] basically he Elijah's telling Elijah and
[1:02:43] Elijah the anointed Prophet turned
[1:02:46] around and said thou Hast ask a hard
[1:02:50] thing
[1:02:51] but this will be given to you on a
[1:02:54] condition
[1:02:55] and so it's the Holy Ghost given to you
[1:02:58] on conditions see on conditions how many
[1:03:01] believe that
[1:03:03] well I want to get changed
[1:03:06] I'll believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:08] and shall be saved
[1:03:11] well that's not all there is
[1:03:16] huh
[1:03:18] how many believes the Baptists they've
[1:03:19] shaped their hands or just just raise
[1:03:21] your hands believe on the Lord now
[1:03:23] you're saved
[1:03:26] if you truly believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:03:29] Christ
[1:03:30] you'll follow Acts 2.
[1:03:33] isn't that right you'll follow Acts 2
[1:03:35] the Bible says repent every one of you
[1:03:37] what must we do to be saved repent every
[1:03:40] one of the condition is that you got to
[1:03:42] repent
[1:03:43] see the Baptist a lot of them died a lot
[1:03:45] of people think that they're going to go
[1:03:46] to heaven they're saved they're going to
[1:03:48] go to heaven with all their junk
[1:03:52] not gonna happen
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:56] boy oh boy didn't that one man say to
[1:03:59] brother Brandon I'll tell you what I
[1:04:01] believe in I believe predestination and
[1:04:03] I can do whatever I want I'm saved now
[1:04:05] and you know I go paint the porn the
[1:04:09] town red and just go have me up well you
[1:04:11] can imagine go out there and get drunk
[1:04:13] and scream up and down the streets
[1:04:15] thinking he having a good time till the
[1:04:17] headache comes the next morning right
[1:04:20] but around says that shows that you
[1:04:22] aren't saved in the first place
[1:04:24] you ain't got in the first place if
[1:04:26] that's your attitude
[1:04:29] amen
[1:04:31] praise be to God
[1:04:34] that's right on conditions if you meet
[1:04:36] that condition of that Essence listen if
[1:04:39] you can see me while I go away you'll
[1:04:42] have what you've asked for that's all
[1:04:45] the light you want that wants to promise
[1:04:50] that's the way this is you and I all we
[1:04:53] really want is the promise
[1:04:55] just give me the promise
[1:04:58] I want the problem he wants promise
[1:05:00] we're not like you so he saw these Spies
[1:05:04] The Promise didn't he the birthright he
[1:05:06] despised that Birthright other people
[1:05:09] rather bam says you know there's a lot
[1:05:10] of days of Miracles is past
[1:05:12] there's no such a thing as the Holy
[1:05:14] Ghost it was only for this it didn't
[1:05:16] despise the bathroom then he spies the
[1:05:18] promises to you to your children to them
[1:05:21] that are far off even as many as the
[1:05:22] Lord Our God shall call
[1:05:26] now I want to say this when Acts 2 is
[1:05:29] met when a person goes and gets baptized
[1:05:33] huh
[1:05:34] all I do is baptize him in the name of
[1:05:37] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:38] come up and they're supposed to receive
[1:05:41] the Holy Ghost aren't they
[1:05:43] I can I do that can I give him the Holy
[1:05:45] Ghost no
[1:05:47] that's completely between them and God
[1:05:50] God knows if their repentance was
[1:05:53] genuine because brother bam says there's
[1:05:55] no waiting if that's repentance and that
[1:05:58] sacrifice is perfect in the right if the
[1:06:00] repentance is perfect God is obligated
[1:06:03] to you to give it to you right there and
[1:06:05] right then
[1:06:06] he goes on to say salvation healing I
[1:06:09] don't care what it is Deliverance
[1:06:11] whatever it is if God ever delivered
[1:06:13] anybody and he saved anybody on a
[1:06:15] certain condition if you will meet those
[1:06:18] conditions God will do it again
[1:06:22] I'll tell you what if a joke was ever on
[1:06:24] fire that church will have to meet that
[1:06:26] same conditions
[1:06:28] how many beliefs if we're ever going to
[1:06:30] be Acts 2 churches gotta be
[1:06:32] amen that we're always one Accord one
[1:06:35] mind one hour
[1:06:39] amen
[1:06:42] praise be to God you love him
[1:06:45] all right
[1:06:49] praise be the Lord
[1:06:52] now notice it's on any conditions
[1:06:54] absolutely you can have Divine Healing
[1:06:56] you can have salvation you can have the
[1:06:58] baptism in the Holy Ghost but it's on
[1:06:59] conditions you have to meet God's
[1:07:01] conditions I love that it's not for any
[1:07:03] unbelievers a man said to me that long
[1:07:05] ago a minister said I
[1:07:09] statements of raising the dead and
[1:07:11] everything else says I don't believe it
[1:07:13] I said certainly not it's not for
[1:07:16] unbelievers
[1:07:19] how many believe that that's exactly
[1:07:21] right this is not for unbelievers
[1:07:25] this is for believers
[1:07:27] oh ask a sinner out there do you believe
[1:07:30] that Jesus raised from the dead do you
[1:07:31] believe that if you believe in Christ
[1:07:33] amen you'll be sad no I don't believe
[1:07:35] that
[1:07:40] I seen in the news
[1:07:43] Arnold Schwarzenegger
[1:07:46] he said about heaven do you believe in
[1:07:48] heaven
[1:07:49] and he had that blankety liar
[1:07:55] that's what he called God
[1:07:57] called Heaven A blankety liar
[1:08:02] I thought woo
[1:08:05] old man about to die
[1:08:07] you know what I thought
[1:08:09] he's exactly right there is no Heaven
[1:08:11] probably for him
[1:08:13] there is no heaven for him
[1:08:15] the only thing he's gonna find is hell
[1:08:18] unless he repents which I would want
[1:08:20] Arnold to repent wouldn't you
[1:08:22] I wanted to see him saved but to say
[1:08:24] something like that amen same way with
[1:08:26] John Wayne he went out saying something
[1:08:28] very bad about God so forth not having
[1:08:31] any faith
[1:08:32] amen
[1:08:33] but does it surprise me brother not
[1:08:36] really because most of those people have
[1:08:38] sold their soul already
[1:08:42] to do what they do and the way that they
[1:08:43] are they have already sold their soul
[1:08:45] and they don't want they wouldn't want
[1:08:47] to believe it if you showed him
[1:08:49] I heard another
[1:08:51] people going out there he says show me
[1:08:53] proof show there you know they know from
[1:08:54] God I says let me give you a tape see
[1:08:57] what you think about that
[1:08:58] where God came down and Vindicated and
[1:09:00] proved himself let him give you a
[1:09:01] picture here's here's here's a picture
[1:09:03] the FBI and the government said it was
[1:09:05] real
[1:09:08] amen
[1:09:10] let me ask you something do you think
[1:09:12] they believe then
[1:09:16] Jesus at one place even though one would
[1:09:17] race from the dead an unbeliever still
[1:09:19] won't believe
[1:09:23] amen so how many believe this for this
[1:09:26] is for believers
[1:09:27] this is for you this is for me
[1:09:31] if you're a Believer you'll meet how
[1:09:33] many believes you'll meet these
[1:09:34] conditions
[1:09:35] now we may not only bring 30 folds some
[1:09:38] 60 folds and maybe some of us a
[1:09:40] hundredfold maybe you don't have all of
[1:09:41] the same Faith but how many beliefs if
[1:09:43] you'll believe it and you'll plant it in
[1:09:45] there and believe it it's for you
[1:09:48] it's for me how many slides salvation is
[1:09:50] mine brother Glenn healing is mine
[1:09:53] sister Sherry I'm healing is yours
[1:09:56] Hallelujah
[1:09:58] Towers
[1:10:00] happiness is mine Joy is mine the Holy
[1:10:04] Ghost is mine
[1:10:06] peace is mine Heaven Is Mine God Is Mine
[1:10:10] it's all mine I accept it the other
[1:10:14] condition I mean there's the other
[1:10:15] condition I want to speak on just a
[1:10:17] little bit and that is acceptance
[1:10:20] this book is a book of Pardon for the
[1:10:23] whole world whosoever will
[1:10:25] but you've got to will and you have to
[1:10:28] accept it like that uh that soldier that
[1:10:30] was shot you all remember
[1:10:33] after getting a pardon from Abraham
[1:10:35] Lincoln into the Supreme Court said you
[1:10:37] know a pardon is not a pardon unless it
[1:10:39] is
[1:10:41] accepted as a pardon this has to be
[1:10:44] accepted by the man says I don't care
[1:10:46] what promise of God I don't care if it's
[1:10:48] the Holy Ghost I don't care for the
[1:10:49] remission of your sins I don't care what
[1:10:51] promise of God in here he says the first
[1:10:53] thing you have to do if you ever got it
[1:10:55] is to accept it then it's already done
[1:10:59] acceptance is a condition
[1:11:02] you can't wander Maybe
[1:11:05] you have to be willing to be ate by a
[1:11:07] lion you have to be willing to be burnt
[1:11:09] in the fire
[1:11:11] isn't that right
[1:11:14] like the three Hebrew children they
[1:11:16] believe that if it's going to cost them
[1:11:18] their lives
[1:11:20] we're a blessed people folks
[1:11:24] I think sister Martha
[1:11:26] Donna said something about she's seen on
[1:11:28] there where they couldn't take pictures
[1:11:30] or something or whatever but those
[1:11:31] people are there they're looking at the
[1:11:33] cottage homes in Rome now and all them
[1:11:35] people there and he's the one thing that
[1:11:37] she said was that these people don't
[1:11:39] celebrate their birthdays
[1:11:41] they didn't celebrate their birthdays
[1:11:43] they celebrated their death days
[1:11:48] that's what she said I hope it's true I
[1:11:50] think it is
[1:11:51] but death days why because he said we're
[1:11:55] just now starting to live today is the
[1:11:57] day we're gonna start to live
[1:11:59] their birthdays were their death days
[1:12:02] they celebrated that
[1:12:04] I can see it
[1:12:06] I'd have probably been one of them
[1:12:09] bring them lines oh
[1:12:13] bring that
[1:12:17] power take me to heaven
[1:12:20] let me from limb to live
[1:12:23] that's right just claw right on you
[1:12:25] there with your big old teeth and get my
[1:12:27] heart racing let me go to heaven
[1:12:30] that's the way the Christians were back
[1:12:31] then
[1:12:35] amen
[1:12:37] celebrated their death day
[1:12:42] I mean you know that same devil
[1:12:45] is waking up
[1:12:47] that walk movement I don't think that's
[1:12:49] anything but the devil waking up
[1:12:51] getting ready for the Great Tribulation
[1:12:53] and to devour
[1:12:55] the woman's seed that is left here
[1:12:59] amen those who are left here after the
[1:13:01] Rapture takes place woe to them
[1:13:05] you'll have to give your life
[1:13:08] to say you're a message believer still
[1:13:10] that you believe in God
[1:13:12] amen
[1:13:16] all right
[1:13:19] that's right praise the Lord
[1:13:23] when you plant a seed in the ground
[1:13:27] what condition is there other than
[1:13:30] planting it in the ground
[1:13:33] and putting it there what's the other
[1:13:34] condition for it to ever grow
[1:13:37] you have to add water
[1:13:42] amen glory now I know one thing let me
[1:13:45] take you on a large scale there's a seed
[1:13:48] you are a seed
[1:13:49] how many of these you received and when
[1:13:52] the Holy Spirit comes around the
[1:13:53] preacher preaches a sermon or you read a
[1:13:56] book it doesn't matter isn't that right
[1:13:58] when that water comes down but the man
[1:14:01] says you look quick in that seat you're
[1:14:03] gonna bring it to life
[1:14:05] okay give me Serpent seated give me
[1:14:07] water baptism it can be the goddess it
[1:14:10] could be whatever
[1:14:12] but if you're a child of God if you're a
[1:14:13] city God when that Holy Spirit comes and
[1:14:16] anoints and wonders it it breaks forth
[1:14:20] I remember when I sprung forth
[1:14:23] huh
[1:14:25] Minecraft Sarasota
[1:14:27] isn't that right Pinecrest Sarasota
[1:14:29] that's right when they said man there's
[1:14:31] nobody ever been baptized any other
[1:14:33] wedding in the name of Jesus Christ I
[1:14:34] said where's the water let's go I want
[1:14:37] to be baptized
[1:14:38] come up out of the water
[1:14:40] sit on the bank
[1:14:42] and just wanted to float away
[1:14:45] sins were gone
[1:14:48] you asked me why I'm happy so I'll just
[1:14:52] tell you why because
[1:14:55] my sins are gone
[1:14:59] amen
[1:15:00] but if your sins aren't gone you ask me
[1:15:03] what upset

[1:20:20] got a lot of thoughts of his past that
[1:20:23] are troubling him
[1:20:25] because he sure doesn't seem to be very

[1:20:33] if we get older when folks get older you
[1:20:35] get more nervous you think about all
[1:20:37] that you've done all your life you begin

[1:20:49] and preaching and so forth and and he
[1:20:52] went to a restaurant and uh
[1:20:55] he thought it was a restaurant but it
[1:20:57] ended up being a bar

[1:21:01] sitting there and so forth with a couple
[1:21:02] men you know with kind of painted you
[1:21:05] know and just terrible and he says God
[1:21:08] how my children have to be raised in
[1:21:10] this why don't you just wipe it off the
[1:21:11] map isn't that right
[1:21:13] and God took him in behind the door and
[1:21:15] I kept watching as I stood behind the
[1:21:17] door and I see my own sins come up and
[1:21:19] every time they would start to hit the
[1:21:21] throne the blood would act like a bumper
[1:21:23] car on a car it caught it neither and
[1:21:25] and I would see it shake and and the
[1:21:28] blood would run down his face and I seen
[1:21:30] him raised his hands and said father
[1:21:32] forgive him he doesn't know what he's
[1:21:34] doing I seen myself do something else
[1:21:36] and he shook him again and bumped and
[1:21:38] God would have killed me right then but
[1:21:40] his blood was catching it it was holding
[1:21:43] my sins and I thought oh God did I do
[1:21:45] that surely it wasn't me but it was then
[1:21:48] it went walking like that like this like
[1:21:51] I was going through that room and I
[1:21:52] walked up close
[1:21:54] being there and it had my name on it all
[1:21:58] kinds of black things and sins and so
[1:21:59] forth wrote across it I said Lord I'm
[1:22:02] sorry I did this did my sins cause you
[1:22:05] to do that did I spin your blood around
[1:22:07] that world did I do this to you Lord I'm
[1:22:10] so sorry that I did it he reached out
[1:22:13] and I said will you forgive me I didn't
[1:22:15] mean to do it
[1:22:16] he says and I'll try to be a better boy
[1:22:18] if you'll just help me and he took his
[1:22:20] hand and patted his side
[1:22:22] took his finger and rode pardoned
[1:22:26] on my book
[1:22:27] and thrown it over behind him and to see
[1:22:30] if his forgetfulness watched every bit
[1:22:32] of it he says now

[1:22:37] forgiven but what about her you want to
[1:22:39] blow her up

[1:22:51] he says you're forgiven you feel all
[1:22:53] right but what about her she needs it
