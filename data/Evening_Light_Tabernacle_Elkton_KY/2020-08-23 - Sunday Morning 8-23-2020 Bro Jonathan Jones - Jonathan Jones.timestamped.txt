[8:56] you know i was thinking while she was

[9:01] we sing that song
[9:06] periodically
[9:08] but do you realize what you're really
[9:10] asking for
[9:13] in the old testament you read when the
[9:16] power of god came down
[9:18] it was normally so great that they could
[9:20] even like on the mountain
[9:22] they couldn't even get on the mountain
[9:24] they would kill them
[9:25] or in the sanctuary it'd be so great
[9:28] that they couldn't
[9:30] and we're asking god to come in this
[9:34] yeah amen
[9:44] we have
[9:47] we're so blessed
[9:50] amen let's just stand and sing it of
[9:56] [Music]

[11:23] [Music]
[11:26] my
[11:28] [Music]
[11:29] oh my what a cry what a plea to god
[11:33] [Music]
[11:34] i want to be something like that's never
[11:36] been on the earth before
[11:37] i want to be your sanctuary lord amen
[11:41] ain't been truly love being back here
[11:44] but i think i'm gonna have to slip up
[11:45] here on a sunday to hear brother tom
[11:47] preach
[11:48] so the only time i've got to hear you i
[11:50] believe is watching you and i'd rather
[11:52] be here
[11:53] so maybe next time we'll just surprise
[11:55] everybody and slide in on you
[11:58] but uh my brother tom asked me about
[12:01] brother girl and
[12:02] i got a text friday so
[12:06] and he's recovered from the virus and
[12:08] his strength is coming
[12:10] back but it's just really slow and uh
[12:13] they told him i think he was still on
[12:14] oxygen this week
[12:16] breathing going to rehab twice or three
[12:18] times a week but
[12:19] uh he is getting better praise god and
[12:24] you know whatever you want to call it
[12:27] the virus is real
[12:28] people's really getting sick and it
[12:31] affects people so much differently than
[12:33] others
[12:34] but you know brother carol's not a young
[12:37] man
[12:38] and it takes him a little while longer
[12:40] to recover so uh he truly appreciates
[12:43] your prayers but he is recovering they
[12:45] told him
[12:46] he needed patience and telling brother
[12:48] carol he needs patience
[12:50] like telling me i need patience it don't
[12:51] always go over good
[12:53] but uh we're believing god completely
[12:56] healing gaining all his strength back
[12:58] and uh seeing mount moving about again
[13:02] i've missed suppers with our dinners
[13:04] with him i try to meet him every now and
[13:05] then and eat with him and
[13:06] through all of this he wouldn't be smart
[13:08] so i'm ready for him to get better where
[13:10] i can go sit down and eat lunch with him
[13:12] again so
[13:13] but uh just continue to pray and pray
[13:16] for each and every one of us
[13:18] hey it's like what stephen said man
[13:19] we're out there rubbing elbows with the
[13:21] world
[13:21] we don't know what they got when we go
[13:23] into the gas station we don't know what
[13:25] bug they've got on them
[13:27] you better be frayed up you better have
[13:28] a sanctuary you better be believing
[13:30] god's going to take care of you
[13:32] so and i thank god that he's done that
[13:34] so scripture let's turn to exodus
[13:35] chapter three this morning
[13:39] i was spent yesterday evening trying to
[13:42] get my mind away and
[13:44] i've never preached this before so i'm
[13:46] not sure where it's going to go but
[13:48] we're going to try to go with it
[13:50] 1958 brother branham in a message i know
[13:53] my redeemer with liberty he says
[13:55] you know how that coincides this morning
[13:57] with the faith
[13:59] the living faith of a living god in his
[14:02] church he said there is something
[14:04] in our heart that speaks that there is
[14:08] a land beyond that river
[14:11] he says i cannot put my finger on that
[14:13] land and neither can any man
[14:16] but there's something within us that
[14:19] tells us
[14:20] that the grave is not its goal that even
[14:23] though as dust there are and dust that
[14:25] return us
[14:26] it was not spoken unto the soul there's
[14:29] something within us
[14:32] a fire that is burning a light that has
[14:34] been lit by god
[14:36] that no breeze can blow out
[14:39] there's no coat spells in the church
[14:41] there's no indifferences amongst the
[14:43] people
[14:44] there's no persecution of the world
[14:48] that can blow out that flame that god
[14:51] has lit
[14:52] praise god for god's
[14:55] purpose that he torched light of freedom
[14:58] would burn into the coming of the lord
[15:01] and no powers can blow it out
[15:04] there will only they will only make it
[15:07] burn brighter as they blow
[15:10] and it's been proven through the aging
[15:12] that persecution
[15:14] strengthens the church amen do we live
[15:17] in that today
[15:18] thank god for a prophet that could say
[15:20] it in such words that
[15:22] there's no code spells in the church
[15:24] there's no
[15:25] indifferences in our opinions there's no
[15:28] pressures and persecutions of the world
[15:31] that condemn this light that god has lit
[15:34] inside of me
[15:35] it's going to burn even brighter but in
[15:36] exodus just to do a foundation and try
[15:39] to title it this morning there is a land
[15:42] there is a land exodus chapter three
[15:45] just start a foundation chapter one
[15:47] we find moses now moses kept the flock
[15:49] of
[15:50] jethro his father-in-law and the priest
[15:53] of midian and he
[15:54] led the flock to the backside of the
[15:55] desert and came to a mountain of god
[15:58] even to horeb and the angel of the lord
[16:00] appeared unto him in a flame
[16:03] a fire out of the midst of a bush and he
[16:05] looked and behold the bush burned with
[16:07] fire
[16:08] and the bush was not consumed and moses
[16:11] says i will not turn aside and see thy
[16:14] great sight
[16:15] why the bush is not burnt when the lord
[16:18] saw that he turned aside to sea
[16:20] god called unto him out of the midst of
[16:22] the bush and said moses
[16:24] and he said here i am and he said drone
[16:26] nigh
[16:27] drove not neither hither put off thy
[16:30] shoes off thy feet for the place where
[16:32] thy standeth
[16:34] is holy ground wherever he says i am the
[16:37] god of the father the god of abraham the
[16:39] god of isaac the god of jacob
[16:41] and moses hid his face and he was afraid
[16:45] to look upon god
[16:47] what a place to be welcoming to come
[16:49] live in us
[16:51] and the lord said i have surely seen the
[16:53] afflictions of my people which are in
[16:54] egypt
[16:55] and have heard thy cry by reason and
[16:57] i've heard by thy tax masters
[16:59] and i know thy sorrows and i come down
[17:02] to deliver them
[17:03] out of the hand of the egyptians and to
[17:05] bring them up
[17:06] out of that land and bring them up out
[17:09] of that land
[17:10] unto a good land and a large into a land
[17:14] flowing with milk and honey
[17:17] under the place of the canaanites and
[17:18] the hittites and the amrits
[17:20] and pesticides and the havats and the
[17:23] jebusites
[17:24] now therefore behold the cry of the
[17:27] children of israel
[17:28] is coming to me and i have also seen the
[17:31] oppression
[17:33] where the egyptians oppressed them come
[17:36] now therefore and i will send thee
[17:38] unto pharaoh and that i mayest bring
[17:40] forth my people
[17:42] the children of israel the children of
[17:44] israel out of egypt
[17:45] and moses said unto god who am i that i
[17:48] should go into pharaoh
[17:50] and that i should bring the children or
[17:52] bring forth the children from israel out
[17:53] of egypt
[17:54] and he said surely i will be with thee
[17:58] and this shall be a token unto thee that
[18:00] i have sent thee
[18:02] when thou has brought forth the people
[18:04] out of egypt you shall serve god
[18:07] under this mountain very unfamiliar but
[18:09] let's say what a prayer heavenly father
[18:12] lord you see this morning as we gather
[18:14] together lord we
[18:15] hear such wonderful testimonies of how
[18:18] prayer still changes things lord and
[18:21] lord we're in a season of time lord
[18:24] we're in the end of time
[18:25] here that we're in such a battle lord
[18:28] but we have a promise lord
[18:30] this isn't just for naught we're not
[18:32] fighting this batter for naught but
[18:34] we have a promise that there is a land
[18:37] to come
[18:38] it is truly a land that flows with milk
[18:41] and honey it is truly
[18:42] a land that represents every promise
[18:45] that you've given us lord
[18:47] and lord let that fire running inside of
[18:49] us burn ever so bright
[18:51] that lord we can believe and have faith
[18:53] that we're coming to that land
[18:56] lord be with us this morning lord lord
[18:58] move myself aside lord
[19:00] teach me lord to yield to the holy
[19:03] spirit
[19:04] lord we love you we thank you we give
[19:06] you the praise in your lovely name the
[19:08] lord jesus christ
[19:10] amen and you'll be seated and i thought
[19:13] as
[19:13] beautiful as beautiful as the scripture
[19:17] is to me and
[19:18] sometimes i often i go back and i just
[19:21] read the scripture that i think is so
[19:23] common that
[19:24] that we've all heard preached on we've
[19:26] all read the scripture and
[19:27] we know the story of how the burning
[19:29] bush was
[19:30] but lord there's so many more meanings
[19:33] inside of that if we can get in touch
[19:34] with god
[19:35] if we can find and as i was reading it
[19:38] this morning i began to see
[19:40] yes that bush yes we know we we know the
[19:43] the wording of the scripture that that
[19:44] bush burned with the flame of fire but
[19:47] never was consumed
[19:48] it was never consumed why because the
[19:50] bush was not burning it was the holy
[19:52] spirit inside of that bush
[19:54] and i began to think as my wife would
[19:56] sing that song
[19:57] oh god that's what we're asking of you
[20:00] it's to come down
[20:01] and live inside of burn that fire ever
[20:04] so brightly it ain't going to consume
[20:06] this flesh
[20:07] this flesh is still going to have
[20:08] thought this flesh is still going to
[20:10] happen
[20:10] but god on the inside of the inside
[20:13] would you burn me out to
[20:15] anything unlike you and anything in my
[20:18] mind
[20:18] and become who you are in my life
[20:21] and i began to think oh god that's what
[20:24] it's going to take to go to in this land
[20:26] you realize they had dreads and and as
[20:28] we could back top this story maybe a
[20:30] little we could find
[20:31] the children of israel had come
[20:33] accustomed to the time they lived in
[20:35] they had gotten used to getting up in
[20:37] the morning and going mixing the mortar
[20:39] and making the brick
[20:41] and to just being a slave but there was
[20:43] something on the inside that still
[20:45] wasn't satisfied
[20:47] and they begin to cry out to god god
[20:50] this
[20:50] isn't the way you want us to live and i
[20:53] thought oh god
[20:54] ain't that how we are as children of god
[20:57] we're living here
[20:58] but there's something on the inside that
[21:00] is crying out for a land to come
[21:02] that it's not happy living the way we're
[21:04] living that he's not happy going through
[21:06] daily life
[21:08] but yet there's something there saying
[21:10] oh god get us to that promised land
[21:14] but you know what in every situation god
[21:16] gives a promise he gives a way to get to
[21:18] that promise
[21:19] you realize that when god gave them the
[21:21] promise that there was a land of milk
[21:24] and honey
[21:24] he had already foresaw how joshua was
[21:27] going to take him into that land
[21:29] he had already saw how the people with
[21:31] mum were against god
[21:32] how they would murmur against moses but
[21:35] yet that didn't change the promise of
[21:37] god
[21:37] there was still a land to come
[21:41] and i think oh god thank god for that
[21:43] because we're living in a day that is a
[21:45] bride
[21:46] we mumble and complain more than we've
[21:48] ever mumbled and complained
[21:49] we gripe about everything we debate
[21:52] about everything
[21:53] but yet that doesn't change what god
[21:55] said was gonna happen
[21:57] he said there would be a bride she would
[22:00] be spotless
[22:01] she would be white as snow and she would
[22:03] go into a rapture
[22:07] that's like oh god and it's such a
[22:09] miracle
[22:10] that moses would turn aside and begin to
[22:12] speak to god
[22:13] in that bush and that god would begin to
[22:16] tell moses
[22:17] i have heard the cries of my people i
[22:20] have a land prepared for them
[22:22] i have a promised place prepared for
[22:24] them i'm going to send you
[22:26] moses to go get them you know god in our
[22:29] day
[22:30] he knew there would be a bride in 2020
[22:32] that was putting up with corruption like
[22:34] they've never been on the face of the
[22:36] earth that's putting up with covet 19
[22:38] that another world has never seen this
[22:40] kind of action he knew that we would be
[22:42] living here
[22:43] but he also knew there was a fire inside
[22:45] of that bride
[22:46] that was crying for a land to come
[22:50] so what did he do he sent a prophet in
[22:52] our day you realize he died
[22:54] in 65 but he was preaching to us in our
[22:57] day
[22:57] he was preaching to the bride he was
[22:59] preaching to the remnant
[23:01] that was looking for that land to come
[23:05] you know so many times we often forget
[23:08] the people that brother branham was
[23:09] preaching to in the 50s and 60s
[23:11] wasn't understanding what he was saying
[23:14] they wasn't grasping the revelation that
[23:16] was come
[23:17] but we come through the 70s we come
[23:19] through the 80s
[23:20] that was filled with revelation that
[23:22] revelation was just poured out upon the
[23:24] bride
[23:24] and we had scripture and we had a
[23:26] prophet that showed us it was true
[23:28] and we begin to believe it and that fire
[23:31] began to burn brighter every day in our
[23:33] lives
[23:34] what is it there's something on the
[23:36] inside of me
[23:37] that is longing for a land to come
[23:40] there's something inside of me
[23:41] that no matter what is happening around
[23:43] me i know where my destiny lays
[23:48] and i think and as great as this was to
[23:50] moses
[23:52] as great as this was to brother branham
[23:54] it wasn't for them to go into that land
[23:57] it wasn't for moses to go into the land
[23:59] the promise was in the moses
[24:01] to get my people out of egypt god never
[24:04] promised him the land
[24:06] he promised the people the land he
[24:08] promised the people of israel
[24:10] they had the land the sons and daughters
[24:12] of abraham the sons and daughters of
[24:14] isaac
[24:15] they are into them is the promise
[24:17] granted
[24:19] moses didn't make it but he didn't
[24:21] change god's promise
[24:23] you know i've been around the message
[24:24] all my life and i've heard people say
[24:26] well is that what brother brennan if
[24:29] what he taught if what he preached
[24:30] was absolutely the truth then why didn't
[24:33] he go in the rapture
[24:34] the rapture wasn't for him he was there
[24:37] to encourage the bride
[24:38] to let us know that the rapture is true
[24:41] the rapture is scripture
[24:43] the rapture is for our bride that is to
[24:45] come
[24:46] that doesn't discourage me when god sees
[24:50] fit to take his man he takes his man
[24:53] could you imagine though the people of
[24:56] israel
[24:57] i'm sure they got discouraged didn't
[24:58] they they're human
[25:01] they followed this man moses they saw
[25:04] his life do you realize
[25:05] moses had been taught from a child of
[25:08] the land that was to come
[25:10] moses had been taught that we're not
[25:12] egyptians we're
[25:14] israelites we're the gods people we have
[25:16] a promised land waiting for us
[25:18] we're in bondage here but one day god's
[25:20] gonna send someone for us
[25:23] he knew it in his mind but it never come
[25:26] real
[25:26] until he meet the fiery burning bush
[25:29] when he met the holy ghost himself
[25:31] he'd become real in his life oh that's
[25:33] the problem with so many people today
[25:35] they've never met god themselves
[25:40] they've said in message churches and
[25:42] they know baptize them in jesus name
[25:44] and they know the revelation that for
[25:46] horse riders and they know the seven
[25:48] seals and they know the thunders
[25:50] and they know all of it but they've
[25:51] never met a fiery burning bush before
[25:54] their us
[25:57] you know it changes you when you meet
[25:59] god face to face
[26:01] you can have all the knowledge in the
[26:03] world you can have
[26:04] you know we can relate this to the
[26:06] natural so many of you in here are so
[26:08] smart
[26:08] that you could astound me with your
[26:10] knowledge but you know what
[26:12] but you can go to school your whole life
[26:14] you can learn every degree you can
[26:16] you can have degrees up on top of
[26:18] degrees on top of degrees
[26:19] but if you never go into the workforce
[26:21] you really don't know what it's like
[26:26] you know we look in the natural okay and
[26:28] we find men
[26:30] this ain't in church this is just in the
[26:32] world
[26:33] we find people that come out of school
[26:36] and they go in to be
[26:37] you know i call them they their
[26:38] lifestyle becomes a
[26:40] properly graduate they're always in
[26:42] school
[26:44] but you know what they go to school for
[26:45] 20 years and maybe they go to school
[26:48] for business and they know every they
[26:50] know every objective they know
[26:52] every syllable they know everything
[26:54] there is to know about business
[26:56] but they never work a day in their life
[26:59] what good have they done
[27:01] and let me tell you something when they
[27:02] go into business they're going to fail
[27:04] because experience is a great teacher
[27:06] experience or teacher think that then
[27:08] books won't teach you
[27:10] when you make mistakes because that book
[27:11] tells you this is the way you ought to
[27:13] handle this
[27:14] but you don't take an account you're
[27:16] dealing with people
[27:18] oh god spiritually speaking that's the
[27:20] problem with the world today
[27:22] that's the problem with so many people
[27:24] in message churches today
[27:25] they know that there's a land but they
[27:27] don't have an experience of what that
[27:29] land is
[27:30] they don't have a situation that they
[27:32] can go back to that they can tie their
[27:34] anchor down to a table
[27:36] and say devil that's where i met god
[27:41] that's where my fire got lit
[27:44] that's where that fire that brother
[27:46] branham talked about that nothing can
[27:48] blow out
[27:48] that's where that fire got lit devil
[27:52] let me tell you something the harder you
[27:54] blow devil
[27:56] it's the more oxygen you give in that
[27:57] fire and that fire is just going to
[27:59] kill up me one day and i'm going to walk
[28:01] right out of here
[28:03] why because there's truth in the word of
[28:05] god
[28:08] how many of them come against moses as
[28:10] you let the children out
[28:11] we know the plagues we ain't got enough
[28:13] time to go all the way through this like
[28:14] it's a three-part sermon but we're just
[28:16] going to have to
[28:17] put it in there but we find
[28:21] that they would begin to go through all
[28:23] of these trials
[28:24] but nothing changed moses opinion
[28:28] moses could come before pharaoh and
[28:30] pharaoh could crack him down
[28:32] call him anything he wanted to tell him
[28:34] he wasn't taking a people
[28:36] and moses would walk out with his head
[28:37] held high so i'll be back tomorrow
[28:41] i'm taking my people out of here why
[28:43] because he had a promise
[28:44] from god that god was going to deliver
[28:47] them people
[28:48] and he knew by the experience with that
[28:50] burning bush that it wasn't just
[28:52] something that
[28:53] somebody put a thought in his head that
[28:55] somebody just told him what it was going
[28:57] to be like but it was something
[28:59] real inside of him that he knew he was
[29:02] the man
[29:04] oh god if the bride of christ could ever
[29:06] get to the point
[29:07] that they could realize they are the
[29:09] bride of christ i'm not talking about
[29:11] two interlect i'm not talking about
[29:13] because somebody told you you're the
[29:14] bride
[29:15] that i'm talking about on the inside of
[29:16] the inside if that fire can light
[29:19] inside of you and you could realize who
[29:22] you are
[29:22] nothing could stand before you
[29:27] no discouragement no disease no sickness
[29:30] no nothing could stand before you why
[29:32] because that fire that's burning inside
[29:34] of you makes you equal with god
[29:36] you say oh brother no i'm serious it
[29:39] makes you equal with god because
[29:41] gail you have made a sanctuary for god
[29:44] to come down inside of your life
[29:46] and for you to realize this isn't my
[29:48] dwelling place
[29:50] i have a land for me
[29:53] i believe i have a land for me
[29:58] deuteronomy 1 we find again another
[30:02] we skip some but
[30:05] we begin to speak unto the children it
[30:08] says behold i have set
[30:10] the land before you go in and possess it
[30:15] you realize every promise of god
[30:16] requires you to do something
[30:19] god ain't just gonna you know look look
[30:21] there's there's a bunch of snotty nosed
[30:22] brats that are running around this
[30:24] world because mom and daddy gives them
[30:25] everything sometimes i think my kids are
[30:27] the worst
[30:28] see i talk about me and i don't talk
[30:29] about y'all
[30:31] okay but there's a lot of brats running
[30:33] around this world that gets everything
[30:35] handed to him on a silver platter
[30:37] though that he's a great businessman he
[30:39] made all this money and they just give
[30:40] it to him and he runs it in the ground
[30:42] because he has no experience to back up
[30:45] what he's done
[30:46] dear god that's what's tried to happen
[30:48] inside of manchester churches
[30:50] oh my pastor so and so i don't care who
[30:52] your pastor is
[30:53] who is your god who is the one that is
[30:57] burning on the inside of you
[30:58] who is your where is your witness
[31:04] behold i have sent the land before you
[31:06] go in and possess the land
[31:08] which the lord swear unto your fathers
[31:09] abraham isaac and jacob
[31:11] and he gave to them so he'd already
[31:13] gained their land
[31:15] they just had to go get it look our land
[31:18] is already there he went to prepare a
[31:20] place
[31:21] he went to build a mansion for us he
[31:23] went to build the streets of gold for us
[31:26] it's up to us to go claim that land
[31:30] to give unto them and their seed after
[31:32] them and i speak unto you at this time
[31:34] saying i am not able to bury you myself
[31:38] alone that the lord your god has
[31:40] multiplied you
[31:41] and behold you are this day as the stars
[31:44] of heaven for the multitude
[31:46] and the lord god of your fathers make
[31:48] you a thousand times so many more than
[31:49] you are
[31:50] and bless you as he
[31:54] has promised
[31:58] you little bride he's promised
[32:01] you a rapture it's time for an
[32:04] encouragement inside the bride
[32:06] it's time for us to get our thoughts out
[32:08] of our head of how it can't happen and
[32:10] it can't happen and it ain't going to
[32:11] happen because then
[32:12] no it's going to happen the promise is
[32:14] unto the pride
[32:16] the promises of those that has that fire
[32:18] burning in
[32:19] sight of them in this day there is a
[32:21] promise that there is a land to carry
[32:23] there's a promise to come
[32:28] on down in jeromey one we know the
[32:30] scripture probably aware but i just feel
[32:33] to read it verse 21 says behold
[32:37] the lord thy god has set the land before
[32:40] thee
[32:41] go up and possess it
[32:44] little bride is time to quit playing
[32:46] church
[32:47] it's time to quit sitting on the pews
[32:49] and waiting on the pastor to bring the
[32:51] sermon
[32:52] it's time to quit sitting on the pews
[32:53] and wait on the song leader to get
[32:55] everybody in a good mood
[32:57] it's time to show up prayed up and ready
[33:00] for service
[33:01] it's time to show up with your arms up
[33:03] in the air saying thank god i'm not sick
[33:06] thank god i'm able to come to church
[33:08] thank god i'm here to praise the lord
[33:11] this morning
[33:11] i'm here to lift my hands i'm here to
[33:14] sing the psalms
[33:15] i'm here to say amen to your word
[33:17] [Music]
[33:22] amen
[33:25] he said and let the lamb before they go
[33:26] up and possess it and the lord god thy
[33:29] father
[33:29] has said unto thee fear not
[33:32] neither be discouraged yourself but
[33:35] you're reading old testament it is an
[33:37] example
[33:38] unto us it is an example unto a people
[33:41] that is in bondage in a land that does
[33:44] not have that promise that is waiting
[33:46] for the fulfillment of their promise but
[33:48] it is an example to you and uh
[33:50] that though we are aliens living in this
[33:52] world that we're living in a time
[33:54] that is so frustrated and discouraged
[33:56] and distressed
[33:57] we have a promise of a land
[34:00] that there is a land and it's true
[34:05] and you came near unto me every one of
[34:06] you and you said we will send men before
[34:09] us
[34:10] and they should search out all the land
[34:12] and bring this word
[34:13] again bring us word
[34:17] again what are they going to bring back
[34:19] they're going to bring back word
[34:20] they're going to bring back scripture
[34:22] they're going to bring back quotes from
[34:24] the prophet
[34:24] to show you that this is true a man gets
[34:27] up and he tries to
[34:28] discount the word of god he tries to
[34:30] discount the prophets that god has said
[34:32] you better get away from me you better
[34:35] get behind to get out of his sight
[34:37] why because he's not bringing you to a
[34:39] fulfillment of your promise
[34:40] he's trying to discourage you and get
[34:43] you to where you can't even receive a
[34:44] blessing
[34:46] but what do they do they're going to
[34:48] bring word into you
[34:52] and saying please me well and i took 12
[34:56] of you
[34:57] one out of every tribe and they turned
[34:59] and they went into the mountain
[35:00] and they came into the valley vessel and
[35:03] they searched it out
[35:05] and they took out of the fruit of the
[35:07] land in their hands
[35:09] and they brought it down unto us and
[35:10] they brought us
[35:12] word again so everything they did they
[35:16] took them back to the word
[35:18] they took them back to hey this is the
[35:19] proof this is the evidence
[35:22] this is what i'm talking about you see
[35:23] you know what i proved to you it's the
[35:25] evidence
[35:26] we can go back in my life and show you
[35:28] the sinner that i am
[35:29] and then we can show you the man that i
[35:31] am today it didn't happen because i went
[35:33] to a self-help group it didn't happen
[35:35] because i wanted to be a good person
[35:37] it's happening because something was lit
[35:40] inside of my life and it began to change
[35:42] who i am
[35:43] why because that coincides with the word
[35:48] if it doesn't coincide with the word you
[35:50] need to get to an altar
[35:52] if you need a self-help book to get you
[35:53] to doing better you need to go to an
[35:55] altar
[35:56] because you're still trying to fight
[35:57] with the old human you're trying to try
[35:59] and fight with the old demon that's
[36:00] sitting inside of you but if you'll ever
[36:02] release it to him and let the holy ghost
[36:05] burn it out
[36:06] there'll be nothing that can keep you
[36:08] from that promised land
[36:12] they took the fruit of the land in their
[36:15] hands they brought it down
[36:16] to us and they brought us word again and
[36:18] said
[36:19] it is a good land and which our lord god
[36:22] does give us
[36:24] you realize even the lion spies couldn't
[36:27] lie about the word
[36:29] they had to agree the truth they had to
[36:32] agree the promise was true
[36:34] they had to sit and agree and tell the
[36:36] people look here's the grapes
[36:39] here's the apples here's all the fruit
[36:42] it all coincides with the word of god it
[36:45] all coincides with what moses said it
[36:48] would be
[36:48] the land is there it's truly there it's
[36:51] not a myth it's not a
[36:52] it's not a magical illusion that's
[36:54] trying to crap to your mind
[36:56] it is true the land is there
[36:59] little bride the truth is the land for
[37:02] us
[37:02] is there it's not just a story told by a
[37:05] man of god
[37:06] it's not just the story that your pastor
[37:08] preached
[37:09] is about but there is a land that is a
[37:11] true land of christ
[37:14] there is a promise to come
[37:20] oh i'm over here i'm going to skip down
[37:21] and read a quote and then we'll go back
[37:22] maybe
[37:23] in 1960 as i was with moses so i'll be
[37:26] with you
[37:26] but the brotherhood says joshua he knew
[37:29] that land was there why
[37:30] because joshua was one of those spies he
[37:32] saw it with his own eyes
[37:35] he said he knew that land was there and
[37:37] he went first and he found out
[37:39] that he could come back as a witness
[37:41] that that land was true
[37:44] brother when it says god called
[37:45] ministers ought not to be so
[37:47] stuffed out with theology but have
[37:49] visited
[37:50] the land to where we're going oh god
[37:54] brother brother come back in our day
[37:55] there's a bunch of message preachers
[37:57] he'd give a hide woman
[37:59] because we've become so theological
[38:01] we've become so that we can quote
[38:03] everything and we can understand
[38:05] everything
[38:05] but brother said don't give me god
[38:08] called me in like that
[38:09] but give me god called men that's been
[38:11] across that death river
[38:13] had been across and has seen that land
[38:15] to come
[38:16] and i can give you an example that land
[38:19] is real
[38:24] god called ministers oh not to be so
[38:26] stuffed out with theology
[38:28] but have visited the land that you which
[38:30] were going
[38:31] bringing back evidence of the divine
[38:34] love
[38:35] and the power of jesus christ to make
[38:37] known to their congregation
[38:39] that there is a land beyond that river
[38:47] help us in 2020 god
[38:50] to realize just because mama called or
[38:53] that he called a preacher don't mean
[38:54] he's got god
[38:55] just because a man can get up there and
[38:57] quote a few scripture and quote a few
[38:58] quotes
[38:59] that don't make him a preacher you're
[39:01] looking for a man of god
[39:03] that can stand up and say i've
[39:05] experienced the love of god
[39:07] i've experienced the grace of god i've
[39:09] experienced
[39:10] the creation of god i've been there done
[39:13] that i've been to the back side of the
[39:14] desert
[39:15] i've been before that pillar of fire it
[39:17] has burned inside of me
[39:19] now i'm one with that word and i can
[39:22] tell you by an example
[39:23] that god is ripple his promises are real
[39:29] you say you get excited yeah i get
[39:31] excited because i know where we're going
[39:33] oh and i can feel every day that words
[39:35] tell you a state thing closer
[39:37] that we're a step closer that that
[39:39] promise is fixed into
[39:41] in fulfillment you imagine it's just
[39:44] what we're skipping down here but we're
[39:45] going to go with it
[39:46] we could find him we can imagine joshua
[39:49] even though they listened to the lion's
[39:50] face
[39:51] even though they turned and walked away
[39:53] from jordan they wandered in the
[39:54] wilderness for 40
[39:56] years i don't think joshua was
[39:57] discouraged today in his life
[40:00] joshua knew what was coming to him he
[40:02] had a promise of a land
[40:09] i wrote down this sitting in the office
[40:12] we find that joshua
[40:14] crossed into that line
[40:17] and though everything was taught against
[40:19] joshua everything alive was taught
[40:20] against joshua
[40:21] everything oh god help us this morning
[40:23] everything is light against the bride
[40:25] everything has told us that we're much a
[40:27] hypocrite there were a bunch of foolish
[40:29] people that were a bunch of fanatics
[40:30] that we've lost our minds
[40:32] thank god we've lost our minds and
[40:33] gained his mind
[40:36] we find joshua across that land and it
[40:39] changed who he was
[40:41] joshua was never the same person anymore
[40:44] why god let him cross
[40:45] death he'd let him cross the river
[40:47] jordan he'd let him cross over and see
[40:50] the promises are true he let him cross
[40:53] over and see
[40:54] it wasn't just a story but it's true
[40:56] this land
[40:57] really does exist
[41:01] no wonder we need ministers that have
[41:04] been across that land
[41:06] that have been to that promise and they
[41:08] can come back and tell you
[41:09] it's not just a story i'm not just
[41:12] trying to make you feel good
[41:13] i'm not just trying to beat you into
[41:15] submission i'm not just trying to
[41:17] control your life
[41:18] i'm here as a living example that that
[41:21] land to come
[41:22] is true in anointed land of god and the
[41:25] only way in
[41:26] is to get burned again and get a hole it
[41:29] goes fire burning inside of you
[41:32] you realize there's no way through all
[41:34] of the discernment through all the
[41:35] persecution
[41:36] through all the trials that a bride will
[41:38] go through there's no way without the
[41:40] holy ghost you can make it
[41:43] i don't care if it's your kid my kid
[41:45] your spouse my i don't care
[41:47] if they don't have the holy ghost
[41:49] they're not going to make it to this
[41:51] land
[41:51] they're not going to make it through
[41:53] this persecution they're going to fall
[41:55] by the wayside
[41:57] look sometimes we need to just open
[42:00] their eyes
[42:01] and don't be in this bubble thinking
[42:03] that everything around us is false
[42:06] there's on this message that we would
[42:08] have never thought would have left this
[42:10] message
[42:10] that we would have stood up and staked
[42:12] our reputation
[42:14] on the fact that this brother this
[42:15] sister they'll never leave
[42:17] and they've left the message why did
[42:20] they leave
[42:20] there wasn't something there that was
[42:23] holding them to the truth
[42:24] they was trying to do it on man's
[42:26] central leg they was trying to do it on
[42:28] man-made experiences
[42:30] and they had never met god
[42:36] you realize a man can come by
[42:39] a good evangelist hey a good evangelist
[42:42] i love a good evangelist because man he
[42:44] can come into the church
[42:45] and he can put a whooping on everybody
[42:47] in the church and i didn't care
[42:50] but you know what he can do he can stir
[42:51] up a fire inside of you
[42:53] he can smoke around he can he can trot
[42:55] around he can get you encouraged he can
[42:58] get you set up that you want to do
[42:59] what's right
[43:00] he can get you to an altar and there's
[43:02] nothing wrong with any of that
[43:04] but until you meet god that evangelist
[43:07] is just working on your emotions
[43:09] until you meet god and allow god to
[43:12] light that
[43:13] fire it won't last
[43:17] let's just be honest for a second okay
[43:19] how many youth chemists do we have every
[43:20] year and i love youth camps
[43:22] i take our youth group every year to any
[43:24] of them that i can i'm not against
[43:26] them don't even quote me of that but you
[43:28] know what
[43:29] there's hundreds of youth laying in the
[43:31] altar
[43:32] but a month from a month later where are
[43:34] they at
[43:36] they've worked up an emotion they've
[43:38] worked up an appetite they worked up
[43:40] and that's all good we need that but if
[43:42] they don't allow
[43:44] god to strike the match it would burn
[43:46] out and they would go back to who they
[43:48] was
[43:52] what is it they can't focus
[43:56] that the promise is true you realize you
[43:59] realize all the ones that come against
[44:00] the prophet and come against this
[44:02] message
[44:02] they don't come against their saith lord
[44:05] they don't come against the miracles of
[44:07] the healing because they can't come
[44:08] against it because it's true
[44:10] but what do they do they come against
[44:12] things that they don't see
[44:14] they come against oh it's the bridge and
[44:16] there's so many people fell in why
[44:18] because they can't see it and they don't
[44:20] have the faith of god just to believe
[44:22] the man for his word
[44:24] why there's nothing burning inside of
[44:27] them
[44:28] they come to church every sunday they've
[44:30] come to church every wednesday
[44:31] they've heard the preacher talk about
[44:33] brother brethem they believe yeah he was
[44:35] a special man
[44:36] look the the hottest believe jesus was a
[44:39] prophet
[44:40] but that don't make them right
[44:45] there's a lot of people the devil knows
[44:49] brother brennan was a prophet but that
[44:51] don't make him right
[44:53] just because you come to a message
[44:54] church and you believe that brother
[44:56] brennan was a prophet
[44:57] there's still not a fire lit inside of
[44:59] you you still can't go back
[45:01] and say that is my promised land that is
[45:04] what i have been given
[45:05] that is mine yeah i'm selfish
[45:08] it's mine and i'm going to that promised
[45:11] land
[45:12] and i'm going to take and i'm going to
[45:14] possess what god has given
[45:16] me i feel like caleb when caleb
[45:20] stood up and he says he promised me that
[45:22] mountain
[45:23] i'm gonna go take it i'm not worried
[45:26] about it i'm not i'm not stressed about
[45:28] it
[45:28] god if it's your time for me to take
[45:29] that mountain give me the word
[45:31] i'm going to take that mountain
[45:34] no wonder brother branham could say he
[45:36] said if god would tell me
[45:38] to go to the cemetery and raise george
[45:40] washington on the dead
[45:42] i'd invite him and use that like there
[45:44] was why because if god tells you to go
[45:46] get it
[45:47] it's going to happen there's a fire
[45:51] burning on the inside that isn't happy
[45:53] with our contemporary lifestyles
[45:56] that isn't happy with what we're living
[45:57] at that is a happy living and dealing
[45:59] with
[46:00] corroborating when it isn't happy with
[46:02] living with the politics the way here
[46:04] but he's crying out to god saying but
[46:07] god
[46:07] you promised unto my fathers and unto
[46:09] their fathers that there was a land to
[46:11] come
[46:12] it's time for me to experience that land
[46:19] we find joshua crossed into that land he
[46:23] saw for himself
[46:25] all the false reports wouldn't want to
[46:28] change his mind
[46:30] he done had an experience with god see
[46:33] so many of us mama had an experience
[46:35] and a false report changes her mind
[46:38] because we didn't have the experience
[46:41] but joshua had an experience
[46:45] josh was seeing that land with his own
[46:47] eyes joshua may have took a bite of that
[46:49] grief and realized that's the best grape
[46:51] he ever put in his mouth
[46:54] kind of some of us i put a good stake in
[46:57] my mouth i can't wait to get back to
[46:58] that store to get me another one
[47:00] and that's by the way joshua felt joshua
[47:03] said hey there's something there that's
[47:04] quenching my appetite
[47:06] there's something there that's
[47:07] satisfying the inside of the inside
[47:10] i can't wait to get back to where i'm
[47:12] going oh little pride if we could get a
[47:15] taste of that this morning
[47:16] if we could get a true feeling of what
[47:19] that land is
[47:20] there'll be something rises up inside of
[47:22] us he says i can't wait
[47:24] to get there why because there is
[47:27] a land it's not a myth it's not a story
[47:30] but it's a true
[47:32] anointed land of god that is bright
[47:35] that is going to
[47:39] all the false reports all the lies
[47:43] get your mind off of joshua for a minute
[47:45] and think about the bride in 2020
[47:48] all of the false reports you ain't going
[47:51] to change the bride's opinion
[47:53] why because she knows there's a land
[47:56] all of the lies all of the insults
[48:01] oh god all the unbelief all the doubt
[48:03] all the people
[48:05] siding with the false flies it ain't
[48:07] gonna hurt me none
[48:08] if they want to side against me let them
[48:10] side against me
[48:11] because i ain't on the winning side
[48:16] why because i've met my fire and it
[48:18] rubbed off on me
[48:20] i become one with him and though i may
[48:23] not look like it sometime
[48:24] he's living on the inside of me and he's
[48:27] moving my
[48:27] every day and he's moving in my life
[48:30] every day and he's drawing me closer
[48:32] and he's letting me know i didn't just
[48:34] promise you that
[48:35] to make you feel better but i promise
[48:38] you that because i love you
[48:40] and i want you to have what i've given
[48:42] unto you
[48:45] i wonder
[48:49] how many people children
[48:52] of god how many children of israel
[48:56] that walked the millions upon the
[48:59] millions right
[49:00] that walked out of egypt under all the
[49:02] plaques that walked to the red sea
[49:05] saw god open it up and cross over the
[49:07] red sea
[49:10] as they wandered in the wilderness
[49:13] they had to think
[49:16] where did we miss it this isn't
[49:21] what we was promised there had to be
[49:24] times they began to cry out
[49:26] and say we've missed it
[49:29] but it never changed the promise there
[49:32] was still a people
[49:34] gonna go into that oh god help us this
[49:36] morning help us to see
[49:38] that oh god we may have failed we may
[49:40] have fumbled the ball
[49:41] we may have missed the step but you know
[49:43] what it's time to get back
[49:45] up on the horse it's time to get back up
[49:47] on the train and say god i'm in line
[49:50] with your word
[49:51] god i may have held you but you never
[49:53] failed me
[49:57] you've never felt me
[50:01] you realize in the day that we're living
[50:03] in whether brethren would going on and
[50:05] he would say
[50:06] we live under a joshua ministry why
[50:09] because it's a ministry
[50:11] that tops the holy spirit there may not
[50:13] be a prophet in the land but the holy
[50:15] spirit is in the land
[50:17] the holy ghost is in the land brother
[50:19] brown may not be walking in flesh
[50:21] amongst us
[50:21] but the god that directed that prophet
[50:24] to preach these messages
[50:25] is walking in flesh in you and i it's
[50:28] that fire that's burning inside of us
[50:30] it's the same god
[50:35] joshua stood there when it was time to
[50:37] cross that river and he knew moses
[50:41] wasn't with him
[50:42] he knew the prophet was gone but yet he
[50:44] had a promise
[50:45] that god had spoke to him as i was with
[50:47] moses i will be with you
[50:49] joshua had been in that land you realize
[50:53] moses
[50:54] never went land did he joshua did though
[50:58] and he knew that same god that had
[51:01] vindicated that prophet moses
[51:03] had now vindicated his life little
[51:05] children if we can open our eyes and see
[51:07] the same god that vindicated william
[51:10] branham is the same god that has
[51:12] vindicated each and every one of you
[51:16] why because you're his bride
[51:19] you're especially human as brother
[51:21] branham was you were special to him as
[51:23] paul was
[51:24] you are special to him as any man of god
[51:26] a daughter of god
[51:27] down through time has ever been why
[51:29] because you're his
[51:32] and he loved you so much that he placed
[51:35] a little lick of fire down inside of you
[51:40] kind of like they didn't know western
[51:41] days they took the branding iron and put
[51:43] it on the cattle hide
[51:45] be no mistake who he belongs to oh
[51:47] children of god
[51:49] when we walk into the world there
[51:50] shouldn't be no doubt who we belong to
[51:52] there shouldn't be no doubt that the
[51:54] world can look oh there's something
[51:56] different about brothers so and so
[51:57] there's something different about so and
[51:59] so
[51:59] they have a different brand in their
[52:01] life they have a different example in
[52:03] their life why
[52:04] because they realize they have a land
[52:06] they're going to
[52:07] this is not the land but that land is to
[52:10] come
[52:14] oh my 1965 things are to be
[52:18] brother brown says now think how that
[52:21] god
[52:23] how we should behave ourselves and act
[52:25] like christians
[52:27] if god's placed a lick of fire in you
[52:30] we'll
[52:30] act like he's placed a lick of fire in
[52:32] us
[52:34] we shouldn't just wander around with the
[52:36] world aimlessly and
[52:37] oh yeah i'll believe it one day no if
[52:40] he's placed a fire in you
[52:41] then we ought to be able to stand up and
[52:43] fight any battle that he places before
[52:45] us
[52:45] why because he has confidence in you he
[52:48] has the ability
[52:49] to believe you are going to overcome
[52:51] every test that he has why
[52:53] because he placed the litter on him in
[52:54] you
[52:59] we should behave ourselves and act like
[53:02] christians
[53:04] our conduct should be like christians
[53:08] oh but you don't know how they treated
[53:10] me that was free i'm sorry
[53:13] come on even as christians we get our
[53:16] own mind sometimes
[53:18] somebody does me wrong and i think well
[53:20] how can i get them back
[53:23] oh i guess i'm the only human in here
[53:26] come on
[53:28] we live there we deal with that
[53:32] don't tell me somebody comes by and
[53:34] sideswipes your brand new convertible
[53:36] you're going to just hug his neck and
[53:37] tell him you love him
[53:40] come on
[53:43] we should be like christians
[53:47] because we're aliens here this
[53:50] is not our home no we're just put here
[53:54] temporarily
[53:55] we've got to go every one of us tonight
[53:58] he said now think in god in his mercy
[54:02] as the mother before the little baby is
[54:03] born it's craving for some vitamin
[54:06] and the mother's word speaks for the
[54:08] dead i want a cantaloupe for a
[54:10] watermelon i want
[54:11] something another it's out of y he'll
[54:14] do everything he can to get that look we
[54:17] know that in the natural
[54:19] sense there's a pickles comfort and
[54:22] chocolate now that's that what a
[54:23] pregnant woman wrote i will do it it
[54:24] don't matter how stupid it sounds
[54:26] if our wife pregnant with our child
[54:28] wants something we're going to give it
[54:30] to him
[54:32] he says if so he says then why he'll do
[54:34] everything he can to get that because he
[54:36] knows
[54:36] he wants his child born as perfect as it
[54:39] can be see
[54:40] and he'll do everything that he's able
[54:42] to do to get it
[54:43] and brother brennan says how much more
[54:46] able or is he
[54:47] to get it he's the creator he now thank
[54:50] you
[54:51] now think how able he is to prepare as a
[54:54] body
[54:54] what to prepare us a body as a sanctuary
[54:57] before god
[54:58] how able is god to provide us with
[55:01] everything we have need of
[55:04] to prepare somebody to live in his own
[55:08] glorious body if we want to live there
[55:11] is something in us calls to life
[55:13] there's something in us that calls us to
[55:15] do right you ever realize
[55:17] when you truly get born again this flesh
[55:20] may want to go back to that honky tonk
[55:22] this flesh may want to turn that music
[55:24] on this flesh may want to hit that joint
[55:26] one more time
[55:26] but there's something on the inside that
[55:29] has a craving for something much higher
[55:34] there's something in us that calls us to
[55:37] do right
[55:38] then god will call somebody on the
[55:40] platform under the pulpit
[55:42] and we'll preach the absolute truth why
[55:45] see
[55:45] it shows you that if you're a real child
[55:48] of god
[55:49] you begin to cry out god take it away
[55:51] from me
[55:52] [Music]
[55:54] sucker-size me from this
[55:57] god i realize there's something in me
[55:59] that's craving for a new land but i also
[56:02] realize as a batter as paul
[56:04] says there's a battle within me between
[56:06] two
[56:07] the will to do right in the will to do
[56:09] wrong there's a life there there's a
[56:11] battle there
[56:12] but dear god i know which one i'm
[56:14] following i'm following the one that's
[56:16] going to get me to my promised land
[56:18] and i'm asking you this morning to
[56:21] circumcise
[56:22] anything unlike that promise out of my
[56:24] life
[56:26] see if you're a real child of god you'll
[56:28] do it if you're a true child of god
[56:30] you'll say amen to every word that it
[56:32] says
[56:33] even when it cuts your toes off you'll
[56:36] say amen
[56:38] i've had to do it before it's good for
[56:41] you
[56:42] it's good for you when preacher steps on
[56:43] your little pet peeve and you lift your
[56:45] hand and say hey man
[56:46] i don't know how i'm going to overcome
[56:48] it but amen that's the truth
[56:52] it gives you a little encouragement on
[56:55] the inside
[56:57] brennan told about the indian said which
[56:58] dog's winning he says the one that i
[57:00] feed the most
[57:02] dear god no wonder brother branham says
[57:04] you want to get closer to god read your
[57:05] bible and pray
[57:07] why because that end on the inside he
[57:08] needs fed
[57:10] he needs an anointing he needs to come
[57:12] to church and get in the atmosphere
[57:14] he needs to be preached too he needs to
[57:16] be taught to
[57:17] he needs to communicate with god he
[57:19] needs to strengthen himself
[57:20] to overcome the wiles of the devil
[57:24] somebody told me one time they've been
[57:25] going to message church for 40 years
[57:27] born again living for god everything's
[57:29] right
[57:31] well i'll just be honest
[57:34] with you wouldn't hurt me to miss a
[57:35] month church you liar
[57:38] i'm sorry i probably weren't supposed to
[57:40] tell you that because you're so well
[57:42] thought of by everybody in the message
[57:44] you miss church your life is going to
[57:47] show it
[57:48] you miss one service your life is going
[57:50] to show it
[57:51] why because you're not look at us you're
[57:53] our live stream
[57:55] thank god for live streaming conditions
[57:57] we need live stream
[57:58] but upstream isn't for a real child of
[58:00] god that is healthy and able to come to
[58:02] church
[58:03] that has the ability to get to a church
[58:06] but it isn't for that why
[58:08] because there's something in that child
[58:09] of god that desires
[58:11] in the presence of those that believe
[58:13] like him and worship thou almighty
[58:15] living god
[58:20] wow because they're not satisfied
[58:24] with where they're living they want to
[58:26] get closer to god
[58:28] well as i said wednesday night i tell my
[58:31] wife she's perfect she said no i'm still
[58:33] here
[58:34] it's truth and we're all still here so
[58:37] we ain't perfect
[58:39] well you know you know i mean it would
[58:40] be real i've often said
[58:42] i'm glad i didn't live in the 50s and
[58:44] 60s because i would have hated to be
[58:46] sitting on the front row
[58:47] and watch that prophet look at me and
[58:48] start discerning my life let's be honest
[58:52] but we can look and say everybody
[58:53] important fingers down but look let's
[58:55] see let's be honest
[58:56] i ain't always been the man i wanted to
[58:58] be
[58:59] i'm still not the man i want to be but
[59:02] there's something inside of me
[59:03] that is drawing me to that land that's
[59:06] drawing me
[59:06] to get as close to god as i can
[59:13] there's something in us that calls
[59:17] to do right then god would call somebody
[59:20] the platform of the pulpit
[59:21] and would preach the absolute truth
[59:25] why see it shows then that you're
[59:28] a real child of god and you begin
[59:32] to cry out god take this away but may
[59:34] circumcise me from this
[59:36] these things take these things away from
[59:39] me why
[59:40] it's needed for your heavenly home that
[59:43] you're going to
[59:44] where he's going going to repair you've
[59:47] got to be
[59:48] a real word bride of christ
[59:52] you can't be lukewarm he's going to spew
[59:54] you out of his mouth
[59:56] god's going to be more upset at look
[59:58] more message believers than he is
[59:59] sinners on the streets
[1:00:02] he's going to be more disgusted and
[1:00:03] discouraged with people that have sit on
[1:00:05] message views their whole life
[1:00:07] and never give in to the glory of god
[1:00:10] then he is the drunk that's always been
[1:00:12] a drunk
[1:00:14] at least he knows who he is
[1:00:17] oh god help us matthew 5 6 blessed are
[1:00:21] they
[1:00:24] which do hunger and thirst
[1:00:27] after vaginas for they shall
[1:00:30] be filled
[1:00:34] you know i told somebody one time i says
[1:00:37] if you ever
[1:00:38] lose that craving to get closer to god
[1:00:42] you better get away and pray you better
[1:00:46] get an ultra well
[1:00:50] but if you ever lose a burden to see us
[1:00:55] so saved
[1:00:56] something's wrong if you ever
[1:01:00] see a desire to see yourself and others
[1:01:02] get closer to god something's wrong
[1:01:05] when you start thinking in your mind
[1:01:07] well i've arrived if everybody else will
[1:01:08] get in their place we'll go
[1:01:10] home the devil's got you deceived
[1:01:13] ain't none of us arrived yet ain't none
[1:01:15] of us got to that place of our rapturing
[1:01:17] faith yet or we wouldn't be here this
[1:01:19] morning
[1:01:20] if we had rapturing faith we would walk
[1:01:22] out of here this morning
[1:01:23] but we're not there yet but there's
[1:01:25] something inside of us
[1:01:26] that knows that land that he's promised
[1:01:28] this is true that knows that rapture is
[1:01:31] true
[1:01:31] that knows that it's coming again
[1:01:33] between six and nine one morning
[1:01:35] that we're going to go home and meet him
[1:01:37] in the sky
[1:01:38] and that longing and that craving
[1:01:42] keeps us coming back he keeps us coming
[1:01:46] back to the well
[1:01:47] it keeps us coming back to the word it
[1:01:49] keeps us coming back
[1:01:50] no how to heart heart the pastor
[1:01:52] preaches and slaps you side to head you
[1:01:54] come back and get it again
[1:01:55] why because you won't be
[1:01:59] circumcised out of you you want
[1:02:03] to be able to receive the promised land
[1:02:08] you don't want to wander around for 40
[1:02:10] years of your life
[1:02:12] and not get a reward for it you know
[1:02:16] it's one of the most scariest things and
[1:02:18] i'm not trying to pick on anybody y'all
[1:02:20] probably good but this is just to
[1:02:21] encourage you but that's one of the most
[1:02:23] scariest things to me is
[1:02:25] people that's been around since the
[1:02:26] prophet was alive and they've said in
[1:02:28] these meetings
[1:02:29] and they want to ride back on the ah
[1:02:32] i've been in the message 50 years
[1:02:35] that scares me that scares me
[1:02:40] cause i ain't been in the message long
[1:02:42] enough but i pray to god the message is
[1:02:44] inside of me
[1:02:46] i pray that god each and every you and
[1:02:47] you that that message is inside of you
[1:02:49] that it's become part of you you're not
[1:02:51] just in the message with the messages in
[1:02:53] you
[1:02:57] it's in you
[1:03:01] oh my john chapter 14
[1:03:04] we have a promise
[1:03:08] let not your heart be troubled you
[1:03:11] believe in god
[1:03:13] believe also in me in my father's house
[1:03:17] are many mansions
[1:03:19] if it were not so i would have told you
[1:03:24] do we believe jesus would we believe
[1:03:27] jesus was the son of god
[1:03:29] do we believe that he was god embodied
[1:03:31] in flesh that walked amongst us
[1:03:33] that when he says me and my father are
[1:03:34] one he wasn't just telling the story it
[1:03:36] was the truth
[1:03:38] okay so if he's telling the truth
[1:03:41] if he's given us an example and stories
[1:03:44] that i just believe what he said
[1:03:47] and he says if it was not so i would
[1:03:49] have told you
[1:03:50] because i'm here to tell you all truth
[1:03:52] i'm here to tell you everything you have
[1:03:54] need of
[1:03:55] why do i need to start a question did he
[1:03:57] tell us all to us
[1:03:58] come on y'all heard it well i don't know
[1:04:01] if jesus really told us everything no he
[1:04:03] told us everything we needed to know
[1:04:05] the problem is we rely upon knowledge
[1:04:08] and intellect more than we rely upon the
[1:04:10] spirit of god
[1:04:13] if it were not told so i would have told
[1:04:16] you
[1:04:17] i go to prepare a place for you if he's
[1:04:20] going to prepare a place for me i can't
[1:04:22] wait to get to that place
[1:04:23] there's a longing inside of me to go
[1:04:26] find out what that place is
[1:04:28] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[1:04:30] i will come again
[1:04:32] and receive unto you myself that where i
[1:04:35] am
[1:04:36] there you may be also
[1:04:39] and whether i go you know and the way
[1:04:41] you know not but you know what
[1:04:43] i'm coming back for you if he goes on he
[1:04:47] says but i ain't going to leave you
[1:04:48] comfortless i'll send the spirit unto
[1:04:50] you
[1:04:51] i'll send the holy spirit out of you
[1:04:53] that's why it's so important that you
[1:04:55] have that
[1:04:56] because he realized you couldn't do it
[1:04:59] without the holy ghost
[1:05:05] oh we can go on and on and on and on and
[1:05:07] on
[1:05:08] but we find the disciples begin to
[1:05:10] wonder
[1:05:12] about like they was lost and didn't know
[1:05:13] what to do
[1:05:15] jesus had died he was hung on the cross
[1:05:18] he was placed in the tomb oh they get
[1:05:21] all so discouraged and upset
[1:05:23] and then they go to the tomb and find
[1:05:25] out the rock's been a road away and the
[1:05:26] body's not there
[1:05:28] they walk with this man this man spoke
[1:05:31] unto them parable
[1:05:32] this man spoken to them explaining
[1:05:34] revelation after revelation
[1:05:36] he told them bury this temple kill this
[1:05:39] temple
[1:05:39] take it down in three days it'll rise up
[1:05:42] again
[1:05:42] but yet they look and go oh they must
[1:05:44] have come got the body
[1:05:47] everybody like some of us message
[1:05:48] believers
[1:05:50] oh can you believe what russia is going
[1:05:52] to do yeah sure can they go and push a
[1:05:53] button and the bombs coming over here
[1:05:56] but i gotta promise i'm gonna be gone
[1:05:57] before that bomb falls
[1:06:01] we've got word telling us this day that
[1:06:05] we're living in
[1:06:07] is going to be the most absurd and
[1:06:09] insanity day of all time
[1:06:11] brother branham said they would go
[1:06:12] totally insane
[1:06:14] they have gone totally insane if they
[1:06:16] get much more i don't know if we can
[1:06:17] take
[1:06:18] it but god knows just how much we can
[1:06:22] take
[1:06:23] so i have to rest back in his word and
[1:06:25] say god you're fulfilling it
[1:06:27] i'm not going to get in the way i'm not
[1:06:29] going to get up here and get on my
[1:06:30] little self-tantrum and tell everybody
[1:06:32] what i think about it but i want to try
[1:06:34] to get up there
[1:06:35] and yield myself to be god and say god
[1:06:38] you speak to your people you encourage
[1:06:41] your people
[1:06:42] you let your people know this is your
[1:06:44] plan
[1:06:47] you're fulfilling every
[1:06:51] scripture along the way and so therefore
[1:06:54] because the disciples i'm trying to
[1:06:55] hurry now
[1:06:56] because the disciples was wondering
[1:07:00] how would this be but one of them
[1:07:02] happened to think
[1:07:03] he says you know what he said he
[1:07:05] wouldn't leave us alone
[1:07:06] he'd send the spirit back to comfort us
[1:07:10] and so they would gather together and
[1:07:11] begin to pray at the day of pentecost
[1:07:14] they would begin to pray before god
[1:07:16] ahead not what i thought not what man
[1:07:19] said not what i understood
[1:07:21] but you said three days you would raise
[1:07:24] up again and you would send your spirits
[1:07:27] god here we are believe it
[1:07:30] you're just going to take that for a
[1:07:32] bride y'all we can't just sit around and
[1:07:34] wait on somebody else to believe for us
[1:07:37] we can't just sit around and wait for
[1:07:38] the other the pastor to wrap us up in a
[1:07:40] rope and drag us into a rapture
[1:07:42] no it's going to take a bride of god
[1:07:44] that believes what god is saying in
[1:07:46] scripture
[1:07:47] that believes there is a rapture to come
[1:07:49] that believes there
[1:07:50] is a land over there that'll come
[1:07:52] together and sacrifice their life
[1:07:55] sacrifice their will be sacrifice their
[1:07:58] job
[1:07:58] sacrifice their reputation and say but
[1:08:01] sadness they would come
[1:08:04] you said and we know god delivered on
[1:08:10] his father's
[1:08:13] sent down a ball of fire broke into all
[1:08:16] of those sitting in that room
[1:08:17] they come out speaking in unknown
[1:08:19] tongues
[1:08:21] you know you know you know acts 2 38 you
[1:08:23] know impressive thing to me is
[1:08:25] is everybody heard it in their own
[1:08:26] language everybody debates about the
[1:08:29] speaking in tongues hey
[1:08:30] i've seen speaking in tongues that's
[1:08:32] wonderful but i've never been blessed
[1:08:34] enough to understand tongues
[1:08:36] i've never been given the opportunity to
[1:08:38] have a prophecy out of that that wasn't
[1:08:40] my gift
[1:08:41] but you know what there stood all of
[1:08:43] these worldly people
[1:08:44] and they could hear it in their own
[1:08:46] tongue what was it
[1:08:48] god fulfilling his word that this day of
[1:08:51] pentecost was to come
[1:08:53] and he did it again and he did it again
[1:08:59] and we get to us first thessalonians 4.
[1:09:03] we know it don't we but i would not have
[1:09:06] you
[1:09:06] to be ignorant brethren
[1:09:10] concerning them that which are asleep
[1:09:12] that you saw or not
[1:09:13] neither as others which have no hope oh
[1:09:16] god thank you for hope
[1:09:19] for we believe that jesus died and rose
[1:09:21] again
[1:09:22] and we believe that right ain't there
[1:09:24] ain't no use going any further unless we
[1:09:26] believe that
[1:09:27] he died and he rose again so we believe
[1:09:29] that even so
[1:09:31] them also which sleep in jesus
[1:09:35] will god bring him with him
[1:09:38] see god sent a prophet to understand
[1:09:40] what sleep meant
[1:09:42] sleep ain't sleeping he said christian
[1:09:45] never dies they just sleep
[1:09:48] all of our lost loved ones all of our
[1:09:50] born-again loved ones
[1:09:51] that we have lost by the way of the
[1:09:53] grave they're not
[1:09:54] dead they're just on the other side of
[1:09:57] the chasm
[1:09:58] they're just on the other side of the
[1:10:00] death river of jordan
[1:10:02] and they're sitting there waiting on us
[1:10:03] to go into that land
[1:10:05] oh they could probably see the land
[1:10:07] better than we can because they've
[1:10:08] already crossed death's door
[1:10:10] they're already standing there they know
[1:10:12] that it's true and they're looking back
[1:10:14] saying come on just a little bit more we
[1:10:17] can make it home
[1:10:24] we're sleeping jesus will god bring with
[1:10:26] him
[1:10:27] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:10:29] the lord that we which also alive and
[1:10:32] remain unto the coming of the lord
[1:10:33] shall not prevent them which are sleep
[1:10:37] for the lord himself said he's saying
[1:10:40] from heaven with a shout
[1:10:43] the voice of an archangel the trump of
[1:10:45] god and the dead
[1:10:46] and christ shall rise first then we
[1:10:49] which are alive and remain well that's
[1:10:52] us
[1:10:54] put your listening devices on he's
[1:10:57] talking to us
[1:10:58] oh i've read this scripture a hundred
[1:11:00] times
[1:11:02] but as it settled here see so many of us
[1:11:06] we know the rapture of scripture
[1:11:09] we can quote it word for word and not
[1:11:11] miss a beat
[1:11:14] but have we allowed it to unite
[1:11:17] with the spirit of god that's inside of
[1:11:19] us
[1:11:20] you want that fire to get bigger let
[1:11:23] that word start fueling that fire
[1:11:26] for fire to get bigger he's got to have
[1:11:27] some fuel
[1:11:29] some of us suffocate the holy ghost out
[1:11:32] we don't give you no fuel
[1:11:35] but if we open up and we begin to read
[1:11:36] more we begin to listen more we begin to
[1:11:38] pray more we begin to feed this
[1:11:40] more than we've ever fed it
[1:11:44] shows who you are then which was alive
[1:11:46] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:11:48] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[1:11:52] in the air
[1:11:53] and so shall we ever be
[1:11:56] with the lord you know i love verse 18.
[1:12:00] revelation is gone now so nobody wants
[1:12:02] to quote it
[1:12:04] for comfort one another
[1:12:08] with these words why because he knew
[1:12:12] when he was on the horizon he knew what
[1:12:15] we would be
[1:12:16] he knew the discouragement he knew the
[1:12:18] depression of this day
[1:12:20] he knew the mental warfare and he's
[1:12:23] trying to let us know
[1:12:25] comfort one another with these words
[1:12:29] so when i walk up to my brother i go to
[1:12:32] thomas
[1:12:33] i'm going in a rapture how about you
[1:12:37] oh i'm going in the rapture too brother
[1:12:39] well praise god we've got something to
[1:12:40] worship about
[1:12:42] i don't care how sick i am i don't care
[1:12:44] what the devil is doing to my family
[1:12:46] i've got something to praise him about
[1:12:48] because i have a promise that there is a
[1:12:50] land
[1:12:51] and in that land is my dwelling place
[1:12:57] and the rapture message in 65 brother
[1:12:59] brennan says now the rapture
[1:13:00] is only he says the rapture that we're
[1:13:02] talking about
[1:13:03] is only for the bride no wonder the rest
[1:13:06] of the world can't get it
[1:13:08] it ain't for them the promise wasn't to
[1:13:11] the israelites that wandered in the
[1:13:13] wilderness the promise wasn't for the
[1:13:15] israelites
[1:13:15] they come across in war and then
[1:13:17] followed the spies
[1:13:19] of the lion's fathers the lying
[1:13:20] preachers of their day and no wonder it
[1:13:22] wasn't for them they couldn't see it
[1:13:25] but the elected bride of god could see
[1:13:28] the promised land the elected bride of
[1:13:31] god could see
[1:13:32] joshua is anointed of the holy one
[1:13:36] ain't no different in our day for you
[1:13:39] elected of god
[1:13:40] she is chosen for the rapture not
[1:13:43] because you said in earth
[1:13:45] not because you believe brother helen
[1:13:46] was a prophet they all believed moses
[1:13:48] was a prophet
[1:13:49] they all was in his church but there was
[1:13:52] a bride
[1:13:56] that rapture that we're talking about
[1:13:59] is only for the bride remember the bride
[1:14:02] said in the rest of the day he said and
[1:14:04] the rest of the dead lived not for a
[1:14:05] thousand years
[1:14:06] the great rapture it's not a rapture
[1:14:10] friends where we're
[1:14:11] where are we at he says what are we
[1:14:14] going to do
[1:14:16] what age are we living in what promise
[1:14:19] do we have there is going to be
[1:14:23] a rapture the bride said the bible says
[1:14:26] there will be
[1:14:26] and that's and that is only for the
[1:14:28] elected the elect lady the bride in this
[1:14:30] day
[1:14:31] that's pulled out the church
[1:14:34] come on brother jonathan what's your
[1:14:38] promise
[1:14:40] i'm going to meet him in the sky one day
[1:14:42] i got a rapture coming
[1:14:45] see maybe i ain't been over there as
[1:14:47] much as y'all have
[1:14:49] but god's allowed me to go across jordan
[1:14:51] a couple of times
[1:14:52] and see what that promised land is
[1:14:54] coming to be
[1:14:55] he's letting me catch a glimpse of the
[1:14:57] blueprint but i know what he's doing
[1:14:59] now i can't put my finger on it i can't
[1:15:01] tell you exactly what it's going to be
[1:15:03] like
[1:15:03] but i know it's real because i know my
[1:15:06] god doesn't ever start anything that he
[1:15:08] don't finish
[1:15:09] and he started by saying i will go and
[1:15:11] prepare a place for you
[1:15:12] and he come back and he said little
[1:15:14] bride i'm telling you
[1:15:16] one day there's the sleep shall rise
[1:15:18] with me
[1:15:19] and those that are alive and remain will
[1:15:21] meet me in the air
[1:15:23] i know that he's coming that promise is
[1:15:25] real it's become
[1:15:26] part of my life it is what i'm longing
[1:15:29] for why because i
[1:15:30] know there is a land
[1:15:35] there is a land
[1:15:39] if you want to stand this morning
[1:15:41] musicians want to come
[1:15:44] i want to read one more thing i read the
[1:15:48] little excerpt about god called
[1:15:49] ministries remember me reading that
[1:15:52] shouldn't be stuff for theology
[1:15:55] but how to visit that land right before
[1:15:57] that brother brennan makes a comment
[1:16:00] he says oh how the church ought to look
[1:16:03] this morning
[1:16:05] see i'm just a believer that as the
[1:16:07] prophet of this day he was an extension
[1:16:10] of god and that he would speak through
[1:16:14] his prophet to you and i
[1:16:16] and when he makes comments like that it
[1:16:18] makes me want to listen
[1:16:19] how should we look what should we be
[1:16:22] like
[1:16:23] oh how the church ought to look this
[1:16:24] morning to find the spirit
[1:16:28] working amongst the people oh you mean
[1:16:31] he didn't say to find the most educated
[1:16:33] men in the message
[1:16:34] no oh he didn't say to find the man that
[1:16:37] knows the most quotes
[1:16:39] no to find the spirit
[1:16:43] working amongst the people
[1:16:47] if you want a church home with the
[1:16:49] spirit that raised christ from the dead
[1:16:52] the holy spirit that would move amongst
[1:16:54] the people
[1:16:56] that's the spirit that god is raising up
[1:16:59] in that's the spirit
[1:17:04] not not a bunch of not a bunch of
[1:17:05] branham quotas not a bunch of
[1:17:07] message theologians he's raising a
[1:17:10] church
[1:17:11] that is moved by the spirit of god
[1:17:15] look there was a time in brother
[1:17:16] brennan's ministry see if i can break
[1:17:18] this okay
[1:17:19] there was a time in brother branham's
[1:17:21] ministry that he would quote and refer
[1:17:23] to what all the prophets said
[1:17:26] but then there would come a time that it
[1:17:28] was a spoken word age
[1:17:30] and he began to speak what god was
[1:17:34] saying
[1:17:35] see there was a time in our lives that
[1:17:37] we could rely upon
[1:17:38] and we still can i'm not doing away with
[1:17:40] the prophet don't even get that in your
[1:17:41] minds
[1:17:42] but we heard what he said we knew what
[1:17:45] he said
[1:17:47] but now there's a time of manifestation
[1:17:50] of what he said now there's a time of
[1:17:53] the bride realizing hey
[1:17:55] that prophet was speaking about me
[1:17:58] that prophet was talking about me
[1:18:01] allowing the spirit of god to move in my
[1:18:04] life
[1:18:04] in my church
[1:18:08] spirit working by the people if you want
[1:18:09] a home church the spirit is raised
[1:18:11] across from the dead
[1:18:12] the holy spirit that will move amongst
[1:18:14] the people
[1:18:15] that's the spirit that god is raising up
[1:18:17] in these last days
[1:18:19] to take the people over
[1:18:23] realize you're not going to go over if
[1:18:24] you don't let him move in you
[1:18:26] to take the people over into that other
[1:18:28] land into the full
[1:18:29] promise of the blessings of god into the
[1:18:32] full commission that he gave
[1:18:33] or to that promise the promise is unto
[1:18:36] you and to your children
[1:18:38] as israel sought for the promised land
[1:18:40] knowing that it was somewhere
[1:18:42] because they had been somebody there
[1:18:44] before
[1:18:45] so is the church today we
[1:18:48] know that there is a land somewhere
[1:18:50] there's a power somewhere
[1:18:52] because there's been others over there
[1:18:56] we know that that land leads me on the
[1:18:58] river we know we're
[1:19:00] headed towards this morning trying to go
[1:19:02] into that promised
[1:19:05] land how do we know
[1:19:08] because we have the evidence of those
[1:19:13] that have crossed over into that word
[1:19:16] brother brennan says you young ministers
