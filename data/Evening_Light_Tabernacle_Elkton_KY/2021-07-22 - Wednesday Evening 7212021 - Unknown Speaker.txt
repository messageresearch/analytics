song jesus loves me this i know but i am so glad that he loves me tonight let's stand and we ask for the thomas to come tonight and speak the words of life and pray this song was a blessing to you and

tonight i think they're calling for a 50 chance of rain so we'll play it by ear if it gets a lot better by the weekend i've got the material all sorted out behind the church there so we're going to try to do something amen this weekend if we can friday night clean up maybe get started and then saturday seal the driveway if we can but if not just give me a call i need about 12 15 guys so amen we'll need as many as many people as we can get amen but uh at this point it's just to play it by ear because of the weather amen so praise the lord let's bow our heads kind of heavenly father we come before you lord jesus once again lord getting away from our jobs and our work lord and lord all the stress of life father just to come away to be an in oasis with you lord and center our minds on your word and to worship you in spirit and in truth with lord we ask god tonight you would just help us lord jesus once again lord to lift up your name to glorify you to bring honor and glory to your name lord and father that we would have worshipped lord jesus that lord that you could love and that you could appreciate father we ask god you'll bless the meditation of our heart bless your reading of your word lord and we ask god you'd help me just to get out of the way that you might use me father for your honor for your glory lord you know all the needs that's represented lord jesus we just lift them all up before you father desire god that you'll have your perfect way in our life lord we ask these blessings and favors in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen so amen this is going to be perhaps just a little different tonight but i was just praying about what to speak on this you know i thought about sunday of what we had talked about walking with the lord and how our walk ought to be and how we ought to be ready at all times for his coming amen and so tonight i'm going to call expressions of our walk with the lord expressions of our walk with the lord and i want to ask this question if somebody would ask you somebody would ask you the question and after tonight i hope that you'll be able to have an answer amen it would ask you what is it like to be a christian what's it like can you explain to me what is it like to be a christian amen so that's going to be the question that we ask ourselves and y'all take some time and just take a few moments and think about that now we'll take questions or means perhaps put it before some of us if you have something that you'd like to share and say well this is what it's like like for me brother i mean this is kind of what it's like and of course i've got several things wrote down that's because i had plenty of time to think about what to write down but any kind of illustration let's say a bible reference a bible parable a story that brother branham told anything that would express what it's like to know the lord have come to the lord and what you walk with the lord is like amen so that if a sinner asks you well what's it like to be a christian you could be able to give them an answer amen is that okay tonight we do it that way i like i like participation amen i think it gets you on edge and just going to get you on your toes a little bit when i ask you a question or whatever and i mean it kind of challenge you a little bit amen because amen i think it's good for us amen so god bless you let's just read the word tonight colossians if you will like i said just uh just expressions stories parables something you might say about what it's like to walk with the lord and to have fellowship with him amen colossians 2 and verse 12. we are buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead now i'm going to read go ahead and read chapter 3 also chapter 3 of colossians 1 through 3 1-4 yeah three if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affections on things above and not on things on earth for ye are dead and your life is hit with with your life is hid with christ in god amen may god had his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen let me just say this i'm going to start off okay i'm going to start off by saying this if someone was to ask me what is it like to be a christian amen the first thing i would say probably is that it's like having died and then rose again amen when i died the old man died and there was a new man that was born old things passed away all things became new how many believes that amen all of a sudden we had our affections on the things of the world and the earth but all of a sudden it's changed now and now i've set my affections on things above and not on things below sure we got to take care of ourselves or we gotta buy for our home and our family that's bible isn't that right but your main affection your main objective is that you amen i have your affections on things above and you are dead notice verse 3 verse chapter 3 verse 3 for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god amen so we know that when we come forth we put on a new man so it's all new completely changed so you know for some of us especially probably i think brother david's mentioned it that you know when he was a sinner he was just a different man you know and no doubt that was probably for a lot of us whenever you were not born again you were a different person you were different than what you are because god changed you amen question has got somebody's got an illustration or something you'd like to say this is what it's like for me to live every day christian life you have a type parable or anything but it's to eat amen i like that that's good that's right does anybody have a story that you could think of perhaps brother ramsey along with that no all right i've got one for you is that okay because this is one of the things i had wrote down you know and that is having a guide is that right i'm just glad to have a guy i mean somebody that'll direct you the right way now brother was a christian he was born again he was god's prophet but yet he got up in those mountains isn't that right and he thought he could find his way now right and he got the storming and snowing and he went killed his animals and hung them up on a tree right and he went straight he was going back the way he was supposed to be and all of a sudden he comes around and there's his animals hanging right there huh he was right back there he was called the death walk amen that's what i tell people is i was on the death law i was gonna die i was lost huh and he says now i know i'm a guide i know my way and everything else and wasn't he going to try it about the third time he was going to try it about the third time he said i'm going to blame my i'm going to do this and he was heading out isn't that right he was heading out and what happened somebody touched him on the shoulder huh that's thing that gives you direction that's what a christian has without god you see out there what happens without direction they don't know what they're going to do next they don't know what they're going to become next they don't know what they're going to look like next they don't know what they're going to do with their hair next they don't know what they're going to do with their skin next they don't know what they're going to do with their wife their husband their family or their kids next no direction but thank god for the tap it means you got somebody that's help going to help you and guide you and help you to find your way because in this world we need to find our way and you can't find it by yourself how many knows the story but i'm saying out west to those mountains so forth you can't even go hunting by yourself they won't let you without what a guide amen so praise the lord you once without a guide and now you have a guide amen and what did he do he miraculously opened up through the fog and everything else so that he could see a certain place and he could see a tower i believe it was right because he knew if he could get to that tower there is a line that they had pulled and all you got to do is grab ahold of that line and you'll find your way back down to the cabin where i believe his wife and his child was and he even said they would perish unless he got got help him so his whole family was gone without the lifeline that's what it's like to be a christian you have somebody to help you find a lifeline and we get that in a lot of times in our lives all through our christian walk we come to places to where you know you need direction you need god to come supernaturally and help you praise be to god i'm going to explain after that hallelujah amen anybody can think of anything else that what's it like to be a christian because remember it's what you live like it's what you experience every day isn't it our walk with our god is what we experience every day what's it like so i ask you what's it like to be a christian and having found god and to walk with god anybody got anything but a bread whatever what will god 365 amen i like that security amen how many knows we just read that scripture about your life is hid it'll hid in christ you don't have to be scared amen i like and let me say this first of all is that when you get into christ there's there's an atmosphere it knows it's an atmosphere and in that atmosphere in the atmosphere of the holy spirit people have wrote almost every song all right comes by what inspiration so if you really want to now i've got things wrote down here if you really want to express there's a lot of people that express what it's like to walk with god in song in song and i could think one of the things that one song that i could think of that would express what brother brad was saying is the song that people wrote about leaning on jesus amen leaning on jesus leaning on jesus safe and secure from all alarm i'm lit hello walking with the lord puts a song in your heart how many believes that we ought to have a song it puts a song in our heart when uh uh fanny what was her name fanny crosby all right it's hard to hear four voices and brother figure out what was said fanny crosby that's right when she was asking oh look you're blind you can't see and how are you gonna know him over there how many know she had such a peace such a comfort in her heart that she wrote a song about it that right she goes oh i shall know him i shall know him she expressed it in the song her comeback was in the form of the psalm i shall know him by the prince of the nails in his hand praise the lord i'll say a little more tower said if that's okay because i got it wrote down it's like being shut in with god it's like being behind the inner veil i mean believes that's where we need to be i'm here to tell you right now this message is to take us not in the first court or the second court because there you worry about everything you're affected by the weather you know what the prophet of god said when things are going good oh you're happy but boyfriend things are going bad you're just all down in the dumps but he says and you meet these people and then what other people you know that are just up one day and down the other in one day and doubt the other you know they've come to church and so forth they're justified perhaps perhaps even sanctified but they need a trip in behind the veil that's what it's like it's being shut in somewhere when all on the outside there's just all kinds of noise and all kinds of craziness going on but you shut in with god and you are it's sound proof as he said you don't hear all those things because if you're listening to all that mess and you're hearing it how many knows it's going to affect you it is going to affect you that's why you're going to be shut in with god amen in a secret place how many knows they expressed it also in that song shut in with god in the secret place amen praise the lord oh yeah so anybody else can anybody else think of anything of what it's like to walk with god [Music] god [Music] um [Music] [Music] um [Music] foreign amen thank you sister that's good i like that amen one of the things i thought about was that you have a friend that'll never leave you or forsake you amen that's what i would say i say look i got a friend that'll never leave me no forsake you when everybody else forsake you he'll promise never to leave you nor to forsake you praise be to god aren't you glad for a friend like that what a friend we have in jesus amen all our sins and griefs to bear what a privilege is is to carry everything to god in prayer amen what a friend they wrote a song about that about having a friend amen praise be to god i like that amen i like that anybody else and many times when you have problems remember [Music] and when i turn myself completely over to god which i have completely don't worry about that in my wife i just don't worry about this one it's god's power i i never turned a moment from god no siree i put him first in every thing i did praise the lord amen praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah god is good amy yes he is made a song about that can anybody remember what he might have a song it went with that he cares for you he through sunshine or shadow he cares amen amen the other one is cast your burden to jesus before he cares for you amen many things like that that's awesome to have somebody that you can cast your care upon all your cares upon him for he careth for you that's what it's like to be a christian amen brother john coming late that's all right we're asking questions of what it's like to walk with the lord what it's like to be a christian if sinner was to ask you well what is it like to be a christian what's it like amen oh my what would she say i say brother i'll tell you what if you're not you don't know what you're missing is that right it's the best thing in the world it's the only way i was listening to tape in 58 brother brandon was talking about he says oh i just don't know what i would do if i was a christian he said i would probably be a suicide case that's what he said i'd probably be a suicide case if i couldn't be a christian why you pull your hair out you'd worry fret amen praise be to god anybody else has anything that they i've got things wrote down here we'll just if you mention it we'll pick it up and mention it if not i'll i'll speak on it a little bit anybody else tell me what is it like to be a christian what is it like to walk with the lord amen comfort and peace i like that answer you have no idea what kind of comfort it is to be a christian and to walk with the lord and it is a peace that what passes understanding that's what it's like to be a christian it's a peace that passes understanding down in my heart down in my heart it says amen i've got the peace that passes understanding down in my heart where how long to stay see almost every aspect of our walk with god is written in song almost every aspect there's hardly any subject that you can't find amen i don't care if it's job or if it's a man that lost his wife and child in the ocean and they drowned it went down with the ship and he comes with another ship and sails right over top of that spot and you ask him what do you have to say when peace like a river attendeth my way when sorrows like sea belows roll whatever my lot i have learned he has taught me to say it is well with my soul so you tell us you know you tell somebody to ask you it doesn't matter what the situation is the great part of it is if you get in a bad place you have somebody that'll get you out if you get in a bad situation he will carry you through you don't have to put a gun to your head and shoot yourself amen praise be to god i like that very two things i've got wrote right down here it's uh peace that passes understanding what was the other one joy unspeakable and full of glory that's what it's like to be a christian and to walk god and remember as we go through these things because i don't know about you but i'm sure that even sunday with the altar we all want to attain to that walk with god that we're supposed to have isn't that right and as we go through these things can you see yeah i've got that peace that passes i've got that joy unspeakable and full of glory i do put my trust in god no matter what happens no matter what comes our way i'm not going to worry about it get gray hair huh because it's a devil business devil's business to make you mad about something to get you upset about something upset is upset let's not get upset let's stay upright is that right and that's some of the hardest things that we'll do sometimes it takes until you get as gray as i am before you learn it to not get upset about things just to commit it to god getting upset about it isn't going to do any good and sometimes that's hard on the flesh it takes prayer and it came to commit almighty god praise the lord anybody else yes brother is before what [Music] i got [Music] my wife is [Music] you know it's all about i'm all right [Applause] yes sir praise the lord so just amen to be like jesus to be like jesus to walk like jesus to talk like jesus amen mommy believes that i mean that's what it's like to be a christian and it's so important amen because if you can't be a light to your workers and those around you then you know because that's where your light truly shows in that you're like amen so i appreciate that testimony praise the lord so lord sold y'all's house huh well praise be to god hallelujah at least you're not amen at least you're not without money and without a place to go as far as you know in a bad place it's just the lord's taking care of you and that's good that's uh you can just rest assured amen i like that amen praise the lord anybody else amen i've got a whole few things here about what the holy spirit will cause you to do amen god bless you brother david [Music] amen that's good that's a that's a good example right there amen i mean another one that we could say and that is it's like having a found that we found the pearl of great price isn't that right and it costs you everything to get that pearl amen and you're broke now when somebody tries to sell you something else well you ought to be the muhammad or this out of the other that's it i'm flat broke sir i can't afford anymore i put all my money in the pearl of great price amen and it is absolutely awesome just to be a christian amen i found that great pearl that most greatest treasure that a person can find by god's grace that's what it's like amen anybody else um amen yes amen that's right amen he teaches us along the way don't he one thing i've got wrote down here it's like going to it's like going to school christianity once you become a christian it's like going to school god has to take you to first grade he has to take his second grade he's got to teach you everything yet you know what brother brahm said the pentecostal thought they had arrived when they got the holy ghost that was just the beginning amen it's like having a tutor to teach you things amen and he's trying to get us to the place just like you go to school perhaps even go to college so that you can be ready to what face the world they call it right ready to face the world you're ready well that's what god's trying to get us is to ready to face the new world not this world but get us ready for that world amen again trying to get us a place of graduation a place to where we're ready for the new world but it is a process isn't it he teaches us many things it's just not all peace and comfort it isn't here but the lessons we go through are not always peace and comfort but if you can learn just to commit it all to god and learn learn your lessons like you should and mature amen i'm glad that whenever you pass the tests god doesn't make you take it over again amen not always the same amen so praise god brother joe i appreciate that about amen you know a lot of us could probably say that if god can help me he can help anybody amen pray or like amen so i like to appreciate y'all's testimony what is it like to be a christian what would you say does anybody else have anything that comes to mind well it's like a bird and it's like being a rabbit i got two of them it's kind of like being a bird all right the bible says behold the fowls of the air am i right they don't gather in the barns in the winter they aren't already they live just one day at a time they don't know where the next meal is going to come from isn't that right but there's somebody that supplies for them i mean believe we got a supplier if you're a christian you have a supplier you have somebody that watches over you amen a lot of times as you are young sometimes and maybe you overspend or you get in a tight place you can't make your truck payment or your insurance payment on the truck and there's your boss so there's your brother there's your family there's somebody you can lean to and say hey can you help me out a little is that right somebody that helps you that's what god is he's somebody that helps you and watches out for you amen so it's like being a bird amen god cares about the foul of the air he certainly cares for you for you're worth a whole lot more than the bird amen so we thank god for being a supplier when you're a christian it means you have somebody that knows what you have need of and he has somebody there and meant to take care of you amen someone used to break down like sister parrish put that seat back and say lord i need to talk to you here am that right help me send somebody my way i need to help just be patient you know right i hope it's not too long get run get out of gas and get all hot or something but you learn to trust in god into little things amen praise be to god amen well i'll tell you what maybe i'll just share a little testimony too hey my son used donna's bug to go down to uncle ease when he got down there aiming that bug quit on him just squid on him wouldn't run anymore i was like well what am i going to do what am i going to do and so of course i called brother david i thought maybe he'd have a uh a trailer that i could take and hook up and go down there and load it up and so you know try i've thought about my trailers but they are like that a bug's not gonna go up over that and so i called him he says well your truck ain't gonna pull that i said well it pulls a big old tractor down the road he said you want me to go get it i just i love you brother yeah yeah well yeah go ahead go down there and you know he went down there and took care of it all while i was sitting back in my bed relaxing lord takes care of things isn't that right or your brother does so praise god amen so now let's just pray it isn't big i hope it's just a battery in the little key you know or something like that but we just leave it in the lord's hand isn't that right praise be to god all right anyone else is their problems that's right yeah yeah that's good i appreciate that i just listened to that story yesterday i heard him talking about that story about memphis an ignorant woman that god honored her so much until he stopped the plane and a year later that boy says hey parson you don't know who i am amen i'm a christian now amen what it is like to be a christian praise be to god i'll say this you know remember the story of the two women that went through the prayer line one was for something in her throat i think it was in her stomach and she kept testifying i believe the gods healed me and her husband finally told her you know you're bringing a reproach you know you're not really healed you're saying you are and you're just hanging on same way with john ryan and so forth sometimes that's what faith is all about just confess it and keep believing it doesn't matter what it is and i'll say this i believe you got to have that same patience with a sinner or somebody that's trying to do right and don't seem to be able to get it right keep having confidence keep praying keep believing god will come on the scene sooner or later amen i believe that's the way god is don't you and that's the way we need to be as a very very patient long-suffering with people amen and outside of blasphemy the holy ghost you know god will forgive all sin amen i heard brother brahm say that god even forgives murder even forgives murder so you ain't murdered nobody yet hopefully no i don't mean yet or ever will but david you know david he was guilty of murder you know and so god forgiven but anyway so praise be to god for his mercy and for his grace amen go ahead um uh go ahead is amen amen yes amen yeah amen thank you sis becky that's right isn't that the truth though all those enemies we have is right down in here and god is working on it and every one of us i every one of us i believe god is working on those enemies amen and he'll slay him amen praise the lord the host rise against me praise be to god how about pressure a pressure release when you come to christ because i don't care what human it is how many knows god has put a religion a thirst in every everybody you find the africans american indians they're all religious god has put that in them to know that there's a god somewhere amen and that they're all guilty they're all sinful but god has given us a release from that scare that fear i put down here the prophet talked about how did it's like a rabbit that is running from a wolf and he's scared to death he's worried he's under a lot of pressure vixen leaves his life but if you can just get to that rock pile if you can get just get to that hole in the rock you'll be safe that's what it's like when you found christ when christ saved you amen it was like coming into that place of refuge amen and they wrote a song god is my refuge amen i'm strong my strong and mighty that i can run into how many is glad for a refuge there's just we could go all night till tomorrow morning probably just talking about all the different things it is and what it means to be a christian amen it's glorious praise be to god another one i've got wrote down here it's like being on a ship on a great big ship on the ocean and there's comes a storm that could tilt that ship sideways that could sink that but if that ship will take and put its anchor out and grip on a rock down there it'll hold it steady no matter how many waves come beat against us go over top underneath that ship is safe it's anchored it's got a anger that's the way it is to be a christian is you're not tossed on life's boundless ocean anymore but you've got to anchor in your heart now amen i thank god for the anchor at 20 years old it's when god saved me when i got that anchor and it gripped that rock oh we've had some storms every kind of storm you can imagine all kinds of waves all kinds of things that's come along but if that anchor grips and holds that solid rock you don't have to fear you don't have to be afraid amen praise the lord like the song says i was sinking deep in sin far from the peaceful shore very deeply stained within sinking to rise no more but the master of the sea heard my despairing cry and from the waters lifted me now safe am i love lifted me amen another one is amen my heart was distressed beneath jehovah's grit frown and low in the pit where my sins dragged me down amen but he brought me out of the miry clay set my feet upon the rock to stay amen how many thankful for that that's what it means you were strifting on lysosome fixing the sink fixing to die but then he lifted you up and let you know that even though you draw your last breath that's not the end you don't have to even fear that it's just going from this place to that dimension amen i'm thankful for that praise the lord it's like the little black woman amen that was the cook for some timber cutters way out in the timbers if you remember in the one boy that came in he was trying to get a job just to hold him over a wanderer and he went in there and they gave him a job with this black woman i believe it was to cook and that night a storm came up a twister the trees were snapping and that woman was over there just singing the melodies and the praises of god she wasn't afraid amen and jesus said can i come over there and he went over there are you right with god no no he says well you better pray pray down he says later he says you know i was too scared to pray the only thing he said he said i all i could say was god if you'll get me out of this i promise yeah i'll address this here under better conditions and i believe it was in one of brother venom's meetings i believe it was that he addressed the situation and he wanted to get things settled amen with god and he got that anchor we will have that anchor that that woman have that though the trees are snapping though the tornadoes are coming you do not have to fear you don't have to be afraid because you know what god has got his hand on you i'm just glad that god's got his hand on you i'm glad to be a christian praise be to god i am thankful to be a christian that's some of the things that it means to be a christian i wrote down here i'm going to cut the service short so that maybe we can sing a few of these songs because how many believe that god is in songs god is in our worship and when we worship i want to encourage every one of us when we worship let's just close our eyes and just amen just think about him and think about the words that we're singing and worship him because he comes in the atmosphere he inhabits the praise of his people many things we know that it's in heavenly places to be a christian means that you're in heavenly places in christ jesus amen and i'll tell you what you you think about it let me just i wanted to say this at first give me a couple minutes but even coming to church we come we come with sincerity we come and pray before the service and we begin to climb higher and higher in the spirit amen and baby said how he would get so caught up in the spirit in his preaching and so forth then he would have to come back down that night and the next day and he says coming down it's all depressing you feel horrible it's just a terrible feeling until you get back down he says that's the way it is with spiritual people that have wrote songs like uh there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's mains i believe it was one of those songs that they were so caught up in spirit until they they go way up in the spirit they'd pray and it get oh my just consecrate maybe for days just meditating on the lord and then they would go up so fine they'd write these songs when they come down boy it was hard amen when you're a christian it means you can climb in the atmospheres in the spheres of the heavenly and i wrote down here you know just not enough time is spent in the supernatural if we're not walking with the lord like we should is because we don't take the time amen to climb into spears that we should because we should still be writing songs how many believe that preachers still preach under the anointing of the holy ghost the holy spirit still speaks but you have to climb up higher come up in the heavenly atmosphere and that's what we come to church for amen to come come out of our work come out of our cares and set aside a few minutes just to worship the lord and caught up higher how many know that when you go out those double doors you feel better you feel better because why you've lifted up from the things of the world and now you've got a taste of the things of heaven brother david if you would come let's stand this evening and go before the lord in prayer lord jesus we come before you father we've just expressed ourselves lord expressions of our walk with the lord what it's like what it's like to walk with god lord jesus we don't know maybe there was somebody out there on the internet somebody that heard something that would encourage him say well that's what i want to i want to be a christian if that's what it means to be a christian then i want to be a christian lord jesus i just pray father that you'll take these words these testimonies god and you'll do something with it we know that you will we ask god that you help each and every one of us lord to re examine and just look at the blessings and the goodness god of jesus and what it's like to be a christian lord i think of that song when i think of the goodness of jesus and all that he has done for me then my soul cries out hallelujah praise god for saving me lord we honor you we love you with all our heart we ask god that you just continue lord with each and every person here and all out there on the on the airwaves lord that you draw us closer to you that you'd help us to walk more closer to you than we ever have before lord and to be more like you and that our brothers our sisters our moms our dads our cousins our aunts and our uncles our families our neighbors everyone could see the reflection of christ in us lord for until we see that lord we will not be satisfied until we know that we are reflecting you the way that we should forgive us of all sin forgive us of all shortcomings and lord we do want to thank you father for the testimony we've heard of how that you have supplied and how did you care for your children and how that we can cast our cares upon you lord for we know that you care for us you care about the sparrows you care about the birds lord you care about your children and we watch over us and we thank you father for your many blessings in jesus name amen god bless you
