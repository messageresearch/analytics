[41:45] by our feelings I wonder how many of us
[41:48] would have showed tonight right you
[41:50] really went by what your flesh wanted to
[41:52] do a that right amen praise the Lord and
[41:55] so
[41:56] amen I'll tell you what I just felt felt
[41:59] like I could really use a refreshing
[42:01] really needing refreshing refreshing
[42:04] amen and my thought is speaking on
[42:07] refreshing so we're really gonna preach
[42:09] to myself tonight amen so God bless you

[42:16] amen it's always good amen when you want
[42:18] to come least or do something to least
[42:20] that's a good sacrifice amen that's when
[42:23] we want to do it amen because if we went
[42:26] by our flesh my goodness where would we
[42:28] be Ain that right where would we be if
[42:31] we went by our flesh's
[42:34] desires amen praise the Lord so amen I
[42:38] thought about just having a prayer
[42:39] meeting
[42:42] tonight just to have a prayer meeting
[42:44] it's called Wednesday night prayer
[42:45] meeting you know amen but we preach most
[42:49] of the time amen so maybe I'll cut it
[42:51] short and we'll have a little prayer
[42:52] meeting maybe I said so amen
[42:58] amen want to give the Lord thanks for
[43:01] all he's done amen with sister Hannah's
[43:03] operation is that right amen what God's
[43:06] doing for sister Mildred amen and sister
[43:09] Pon let's give the Lord a
[43:13] hand amen certainly glad that that went
[43:16] well amen and that she's recouping
[43:19] recovering amen and so we continue to
[43:22] pray that she'd get her strength back
[43:23] she works hard as it is and so I'm sure
[43:26] she needs a lot of rest amen so God
[43:29] bless her Amen in a special way um I
[43:34] can't think of any another any other
[43:36] major
[43:38] announcements so let's just bow our
[43:40] heads and pray Lord Jesus we come before
[43:42] you tonight thankful once again Lord to
[43:45] be inside a nice warm place Lord Jesus
[43:47] and to honor you Lord Jesus by coming
[43:50] out father and making the sacrifice of
[43:52] our time lord Jesus to come to hear your
[43:55] word and to see what you would have for
[43:57] us tonight God and we just pray Lord
[43:59] that you'll bless what I feel you've
[44:01] laid on my heart to speak for a little
[44:03] while that you would just have your way
[44:05] God and just speak to our hearts tonight
[44:07] Lord once again we want to thank you
[44:09] Lord we just want to thank you for all
[44:12] that you do for us every day in Jesus
[44:14] name amen amen my thought originally
[44:18] come from Aaron's Rod I titled it
[44:22] Aaron's Rod but I really want to talk
[44:24] about refreshing refreshment
[44:28] amen being refreshed but Aaron's Rod
[44:31] amen and how that when it was inside of
[44:34] the holies of holies how did it budded
[44:37] and blossomed and yielded almonds amen
[44:42] amen and
[44:43] so amen if you will turn your Bibles and
[44:46] we'll go to Isaiah first I really only
[44:49] had to two scriptures usually my Bible
[44:52] is got about 20 little tabs I'm going to
[44:55] read the second one one but just before
[44:57] I came out amen I had two more that kind
[45:00] of come to me so we'll see if we go
[45:02] there amen amen so praise the Lord amen
[45:06] in
[45:07] Isaiah
[45:15] 28 Isaiah
[45:21] 28 thank everybody for coming out and
[45:23] God bless those listening and streaming
[45:26] wherever they are amen amen praise the
[45:29] Lord we're getting close now we're
[45:31] getting close now to be able to get our
[45:33] fast internet get some better cameras up
[45:36] so that anybody that is streaming can
[45:38] see it better and hear it better amen so
[45:41] shouldn't be long it's on string toown
[45:43] road coming our way I guess amen all
[45:46] right Isaiah 28 verse 9 Whom Shall he
[45:50] teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make
[45:52] to understand Doctrine to them that are
[45:55] weaned uh from the milk and drawn from
[45:57] the breast precept must be upon precept
[46:00] precept upon precept line upon line here
[46:02] a little and there a little for with a
[46:05] stammering lips and another tongue will
[46:08] he speak to his people amen I believe
[46:10] this was talking about Pentecost amen
[46:13] and he says to whom he said this is to
[46:16] rest wherewith he will cause the weary
[46:20] to
[46:24] rest and
[46:26] this is the refreshing yet they would
[46:29] not hear amen may God add his Blessing
[46:32] to the reading of the word you can be
[46:33] seated tonight amen this is not only is
[46:37] this the rest amen that'll cause the
[46:40] weary to rest but it's also a refreshing
[46:45] amen you know I I just want to start
[46:48] perhaps by talking about all the re that
[46:50] we
[46:51] need the r
[46:54] re how manyan we human beings we have a
[46:56] lot of reads that we need amen one is we
[46:59] need to be refreshed amen the other one
[47:03] is we need to remember how many believes
[47:06] we are forgetful people I believe Peter
[47:09] said amen that he wanted to stir up our
[47:11] Pure Minds by way of
[47:14] remembrance amen so we need our minds
[47:17] amen refreshed and we need to remember
[47:19] things amen a lot of times we need
[47:22] rebuke is that right as many as I love
[47:25] rebuke I chasen and so forth ain't that
[47:28] right amen
[47:29] reprove amen reprove us sometimes we
[47:33] need revived amen I many believes we as
[47:36] humans need
[47:37] revived amen because we are human and as
[47:40] long as we are in this body and in this
[47:42] flesh amen it's going to be a constant
[47:45] pull in the wrong
[47:46] direction amen amen so amen I'll just go
[47:52] ahead and bring the one scripture in
[47:54] Hebrews 2 says you you know therefore we
[47:57] ought to give the more Earnest to the
[47:58] things that we have heard least at any
[48:00] time we should let them slip cuz how
[48:02] many knows as human beings we're prone
[48:05] to
[48:06] slip we're prone to slip we're prone to
[48:09] slide amen a lot of times and that is a
[48:11] lot of times backwards
[48:13] amen amen but here we look at this here
[48:17] uh scripture about talking about this is
[48:19] the this is what amen this is the rest
[48:22] wherewith I will cause the weary to rest
[48:25] now I want to read the scripture about
[48:26] Aaron's uh Rod because we know that
[48:29] where how many knows where Aaron's Rod
[48:32] was amen he was inside of that holies of
[48:34] holies in the presence of God isn't that
[48:37] right and it says in that you don't have
[48:40] to turn to
[48:42] it numbers 17 and5
[48:45] Blossom and I will make to cease from me
[48:49] the murmurings of the children of Israel
[48:51] whereby they murmur against you amen so
[48:56] we know that uh Moses laid that that he
[49:00] laid that Aaron's Rod they had put
[49:02] everybody a lot of other people's rods
[49:04] in there too but he said the one that
[49:06] blossoms and so forth is the one that he
[49:08] amen has chosen to be his priest and so
[49:11] forth
[49:12] amen amen and I got to thinking about
[49:15] the holies of holies now when we think
[49:17] about the holies of holies I didn't
[49:19] bring the little thing out here I love
[49:20] to use it amen and I've preached on this
[49:22] a bunch of times but you know
[49:26] when you think about it I think it was
[49:28] about four
[49:29] me messages brother Brandon preached one
[49:32] with the inil amen um the other one was
[49:36] why are the people so tossed about and I
[49:39] can't think it off top of my my head
[49:41] right now but there was the inner Court
[49:43] perhaps there was two more amen uh uh
[49:47] message that the prophet preached and he
[49:49] focused on Amen on uh the holies of
[49:52] holies in the Tabernacle in the
[49:54] wilderness amen we know that at the
[49:57] beginning of course and this has to do
[49:59] with
[50:01] the presence of God Amen I believe perua
[50:06] means the presence of God Amen and soen
[50:09] we want to talk about the presence of
[50:11] God for a little while amen and again
[50:15] just looking at the scope of the whole
[50:17] picture when you look at the scope the
[50:19] whole picture Paul said that we might
[50:21] know the height and the breadth and the
[50:23] depth to know the love of God and to to
[50:26] to understand that begin to Fathom the
[50:29] depth of God amen amen and so I think
[50:32] what was it what was it that we preached
[50:34] last something about being closer to God
[50:36] and how we should get and what we do to
[50:38] get closer to God ain't that right it
[50:40] talked about meditating on him day and
[50:42] night
[50:43] and tell your children to tie it upon
[50:46] your post and let it be as funlet
[50:48] between your eyes and so forth amen um
[50:53] I'm not sure I I would think somewhere
[50:54] it talks about even on you know
[50:57] sometimes even on yourself amen
[50:59] frontless between even on your body amen
[51:02] you know so I you know it's not so that
[51:04] so wrong to where uh you
[51:08] know you might get a persecution but
[51:10] that's okay to have scriptures perhaps
[51:12] on your shirt or whatever amen but
[51:16] anyway just to meditate on him day and
[51:17] night and so forth that's going to be
[51:19] what brings you closer as you has
[51:20] Fellowship as you have communion with
[51:22] God Amen tonight's going to be focused
[51:24] more amen going into that Holy place now
[51:27] let's go all the way back to the
[51:28] beginning we know Adam and Eve after
[51:30] they sinned and they fell short amen of
[51:32] the glory of God they were thrown out
[51:34] and they were ke kicked out so to speak
[51:36] the Angels amen ran them out of the
[51:39] Garden of Eden and there was cherubs
[51:41] there was Angels put up in place Amen to
[51:43] keep them from the Tree of
[51:47] Life isin't that right to keep them away
[51:50] from the Tree of Life and nobody could
[51:51] come in the presence of God because they
[51:54] were not holy they were not pure and you
[51:56] couldn't come into His
[52:01] presence amen so he kept them out then
[52:04] the next place we find God tabernacling
[52:07] of course we know that he was in the
[52:08] they built it and the holies of
[52:11] holies there were three courts there was
[52:13] the outer Court where they had like the
[52:15] sacrifice their sacrifice they washed it
[52:18] and burned it and so forth am me the
[52:20] second part was a actually a door that
[52:22] they went into and it was the sanctuary
[52:24] like where they had the seven golden
[52:26] candlesticks and all of that amen typing
[52:28] the church ages a that right and then
[52:30] behind the that was the holies of holies
[52:33] there was a veil or a curtain made out
[52:35] of badger skins and all of those type of
[52:37] things Amen to keep people from the back
[52:39] there amen and you dare shouldn't go
[52:42] back there or you would be
[52:44] struck
[52:47] dead and even Aaron had to have
[52:51] everything just right amen he had to
[52:55] have everything just right he had to
[52:57] walk right he had to smell how many of
[52:59] those he had to be
[53:00] perfumed even he had to wear the perfume
[53:03] and everything like that amen oh my I
[53:06] don't know if I can find it right off
[53:08] the gate or not gogate or not but amen
[53:11] he had to come in there just right amen
[53:15] because if he didn't amen he was also
[53:18] struck dead but he had to come right and
[53:20] it was a type it was a type how that a
[53:24] sinner any body that comes and
[53:26] approaches God and he had he had I
[53:28] believe he had a thing of blood in front
[53:30] of him ain't that right he had to come
[53:33] with blood and how many knows when you
[53:34] approach the throne of God and you want
[53:35] to get anything from God you don't just
[53:38] come to any way you want
[53:41] to however you want to know you better
[53:43] come by the blood you ain't going to get
[53:46] to God unless you know you bring the
[53:48] blood you come by the blood of Jesus
[53:50] Christ amen and amen because even in the
[53:52] New Testament it says we can approach a
[53:54] throne of grace
[53:55] boldly coming boldly Before the Throne
[53:57] of Grace by the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:00] amen and so we know that they were un
[54:03] allowed to they would you B Dar to go in
[54:05] behind that Holy don't don't dare come
[54:07] into that presence amen but you know uh
[54:11] you know the other place that we find
[54:13] now how many knows where the holies of
[54:15] holies is now yeah where's the holies of
[54:19] holies now Jesus Christ how many US
[54:22] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost
[54:25] is the holies of holies that's why Jesus
[54:29] said
[54:31] come I mean know after the death burial
[54:34] Resurrection you know then you could
[54:36] come into the presence of God not
[54:40] before not before the death and actually
[54:43] whenever that veil was rent how me when
[54:45] that veil was
[54:47] rent amen and put that put God
[54:51] in back into the presence of God amen
[54:55] and then
[54:57] Jus said come unto me all ye who are
[55:00] weary and heavy laden and I will give
[55:02] you rest and you know I don't care where
[55:04] you are I don't care what church service
[55:06] it is I don't care where you are it's
[55:08] all about the presence of God right
[55:11] that's what it's
[55:12] about amen and you and I are a
[55:15] privileged people how many believe
[55:17] you're privileged people to come into
[55:20] the presence of God okay there was
[55:21] something else I wanted to start
[55:24] with
[55:29] amen
[55:32] amen all
[55:40] right
[55:42] well where's it
[55:44] at right here this last one underneath
[55:47] here let's start like this I heard
[55:50] brother make mention this and this is
[55:53] kind of off the subject but I just I
[55:56] thought it was a good
[55:59] start I believe we're living in a very
[56:03] wonderful glorious day of opportunity
[56:06] when people of this day living to see
[56:09] the Shadows of the coming of the son of
[56:11] man now into the greatest Revival it
[56:15] this this in 56 into the greatest
[56:18] Revival there was
[56:23] ever known
[56:28] amen wouldn't it be something if we just
[56:31] stopped
[56:33] there we just stop there you would think
[56:35] that the world was going to burst into
[56:37] the greatest Revival ever now it was
[56:39] between 1956 and 1957 all right Revival
[56:42] and he went and preached in America
[56:45] turned
[56:47] Christ
[56:50] down so much so that brother Braham said
[56:52] I don't even pray for it there's no hope
[56:55] there's not a hope for her she has
[56:57] crossed the line between mercy and
[57:00] judgment there's no coming back for
[57:02] her how many know those are some
[57:04] tremendous big
[57:10] words now
[57:13] let let me read the rest of the
[57:17] quote
[57:19] or it's it's going into the darkest
[57:23] chaos that been ever known in
[57:29] history now I have a question for you
[57:32] which you way did it go brother
[57:34] Glenn the second
[57:37] one didn't it that's exactly right it
[57:40] went into the second
[57:43] way I mean if you can't see the
[57:48] chaos in the darkness you got to be
[57:52] blind why now notice
[57:55] it's a great time of people to make a
[57:59] decision on what they're going to
[58:02] do amen how many it was a time of
[58:07] decision now can I tell you what my
[58:09] Revelation from all of this
[58:11] is my Revelation from all of this is is
[58:15] that those who accept the
[58:17] Lord those who receive it they're going
[58:20] to have the
[58:22] greatest Revival the Great thing ever
[58:26] known to man is what they're going to
[58:29] have how many believe you are part of
[58:32] that I am part of that why because he
[58:35] going to usher in and he's going to
[58:37] bring the very coming of the Lord Jesus
[58:39] Christ he said we're living right in
[58:42] the
[58:44] shadows and you and I as living and
[58:46] we're going to get to see him come in
[58:49] Cloud of Glory we're going to have the
[58:51] biggest Revival that we ever had it's
[58:53] the greatest person that's ever been
[58:55] known
[58:56] about and they could have all had it but
[58:59] they didn't have one it they refused it
[59:01] they rejected but do not have receive it
[59:04] accept it what a wonderful thing it
[59:11] is that's what I got out of
[59:14] it that's why we
[59:16] Rejoice that why we we just don't know
[59:20] how to act hardly
[59:22] huh why because when we think about
[59:29] the word that was manifested to us and
[59:32] how Christ came in our day
[59:37] and
[59:41] amen oh
[59:43] my brother BRS what's the matter with
[59:46] you people he says you seen the
[59:52] goodness let me go back a little can I
[59:54] just take my time tonight we'll we'll
[59:57] start prayer meeting at 10: maybe
[59:59] tonight or something I don't
[1:00:01] know sometime ago he a man was on his
[1:00:04] road to the seaside he was going over
[1:00:07] there for a rest and he just wanted to
[1:00:08] refresh himself because he loved the
[1:00:11] thought of what he would hear the
[1:00:12] seagulls that flew over the water and
[1:00:14] skipped down into the great white tip
[1:00:16] waves as he roared and burst in the air
[1:00:19] and he wanted to smell the salt water he
[1:00:21] said oh it'd be such a rest on that life
[1:00:24] to live that
[1:00:25] Seashore for a while and I just want to
[1:00:28] rest I want to live by the seashore to
[1:00:30] see all the things that she has to offer
[1:00:32] the blue skies as it
[1:00:34] reflect from the sky to the water how
[1:00:37] that the foam of the salt water will
[1:00:39] boil up to a great wave and strike and
[1:00:41] roll he says oh if I can just stand and
[1:00:44] look at that and hear the scream of the
[1:00:46] go I don't know about you but I can hear
[1:00:48] it now can't you Peter spend a lot of
[1:00:50] time there by the Seas
[1:00:53] has I don't know if that sounds anything
[1:00:55] like it but hopefully it's
[1:00:57] close ain't that right
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:00] close yeah we know because
[1:01:04] just Oh my he wanted to hear it just

[1:01:14] at it he the scream the go on his Root

[1:01:23] in Old Salt old sailor from the
[1:01:26] sea another place brother bam said he
[1:01:29] about 70 something years old
[1:01:33] he said where go th he says I go down to
[1:01:36] the seashore to enjoy the goodness of
[1:01:38] the Sea and the old Saul said
[1:01:41] I see nothing
[1:01:45] so strange about it amen I wish I had a
[1:01:49] different quote on that because he made
[1:01:50] it he says I don't see nothing so
[1:01:52] special about it it's just water it's
[1:01:53] just got
[1:01:57] the waters are just water Sky to Sky the
[1:01:59] go is another bird you see he said but
[1:02:01] he had seen so much of it until it had
[1:02:04] become common to him it's not amen read
[1:02:09] is but you get away from the presence of
[1:02:11] God oh this is another Wednesday night
[1:02:13] this is another Bor church
[1:02:16] service oh it gets
[1:02:19] D gets
[1:02:21] old these things get old but he should
[1:02:24] never get old to us isin't that
[1:02:27] right oh my it wasn't thrilling to him
[1:02:30] anymore that's what's the matter with
[1:02:34] you people but the B says even the
[1:02:37] Pentecost the people things are and I
[1:02:41] looked on this quote when I was looking
[1:02:42] this up about becoming common he says
[1:02:44] man just you just do one of those in
[1:02:47] Tanzania and Africa and those places and
[1:02:49] 10,000 will fall at the feet of Jesus
[1:02:53] the reality that God is real and here we
[1:02:56] sit better Pentecostals people at the
[1:02:59] Tabernacle come and say well I guess it
[1:03:01] was pretty good I guess it's all
[1:03:05] right I gotta go to work tomorrow again
[1:03:07] it just doesn't thrill them anymore
[1:03:09] don't ever let the message people would
[1:03:12] go to church people would offer your
[1:03:15] heart I believe he to come from your
[1:03:17] heart don't let it get
[1:03:20] stagnated amen I
[1:03:23] was when I was meditating on this I
[1:03:26] thought about become common become
[1:03:29] common to me is a
[1:03:32] symptom a symptom of getting called on
[1:03:35] God just like if you was to you doesn't
[1:03:38] mean to you as much as it ever
[1:03:40] did now where was we that's right Divine
[1:03:46] thing listen and divine things of God
[1:03:48] moving and work until it becomes
[1:03:51] common you don't notice it no more in
[1:03:53] the me ings I've noticed people where
[1:03:56] the Lord under discernment will speak
[1:03:58] right out in the audience just as he did
[1:04:01] when he walked the shores
[1:04:03] of Galilee just like
[1:04:07] he promised that he said he would do the
[1:04:10] first time they say oh boy did that ever
[1:04:13] that's quite something that's got to be
[1:04:15] the Lord and the next time
[1:04:22] well become
[1:04:27] and he T it and after a while well it's
[1:04:30] just another
[1:04:32] thing yeah brother brandham
[1:04:36] watch watched
[1:04:38] people in that
[1:04:40] condition let it
[1:04:43] become
[1:04:49] common I
[1:04:52] wonder No Doubt but that
[1:04:55] he we as Christians I
[1:04:59] don't care if you're a Christian
[1:05:01] whatever you are some people man they're
[1:05:02] not they're not it's past don't notice
[1:05:04] your eyes of
[1:05:08] understanding you to let things become
[1:05:11] common it's not a thrill anymore not a
[1:05:14] thrill to get on your knees and talk to
[1:05:16] the Lord
[1:05:17] anymore boy that's a real good sign that
[1:05:19] you need a good prayer that's
[1:05:22] right now listen H be on anything you
[1:05:25] walk know it should do something to you
[1:05:29] it should shake your faith till you open
[1:05:32] up Every Door of Faith and everything

[1:05:38] me

[1:06:01] misunderstandings away take my doubts

[1:06:06] people have let it become common what
[1:06:07] they need is little eyes they have to
[1:06:09] open their eyes and realize that they've
[1:06:11] gotten cold on God churches and people
[1:06:14] they need eyes have the eyes have of the
