[23:26] morning brothers and sisters ask us to
[23:29] open our bibles the second corinthians
[23:31] 6.
[23:35] we'll read that whole chapter
[23:39] the last verse together
[23:44] it'll be second corinthians 6.
[23:50] we then as workers together with him
[23:52] beseech you also that you receive not
[23:55] the grace of god in vain
[24:12] giving no offense in anything that the
[24:14] ministry be not blamed
[24:25] and straps imprisonments and torments
[24:29] and labors and watchings and fastings
[24:33] [Music]
[24:39] by the word of truth by the power of god
[24:43] by the armor of righteousness on the
[24:44] right hand and on the left
[24:55] as unknown and yet well known as dying
[24:59] and behold we live as chastened and not
[25:01] killed
[25:11] o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto
[25:14] you our heart is enlarged
[25:21] now for recompense in the same i speak
[25:24] as
[25:24] unto my children be also enlarged
[25:36] what community
[25:39] and what concord have christ with bella
[25:42] and what part
[25:43] hath he that believeth with an infidel
[25:48] of god
[25:59] wherefore come out from among them and
[26:02] be ye separate
[26:03] saith the lord and touch is not an
[26:05] unclean thing and i will receive you
[26:08] and i will be your father unto you and
[26:10] you shall be my sons and daughters saith
[26:13] the lord almighty
[26:15] brother david
[26:28] you can all be seated god bless you all
[26:31] i was uh
[26:33] in my office this morning i wrote this
[26:35] down i think the last time
[26:37] we actually had an adult son this school
[26:39] i think i wrote it down was like the
[26:41] 15th of march in 2020 so that's how long
[26:44] it's been but since it's been a while
[26:48] um i was going to get if you want you
[26:50] can turn with me to uh
[26:52] titus the second and third chapter but i
[26:55] haven't done this in a while
[26:57] i usually do this every couple of months
[27:02] before i get started but you know you
[27:05] could spend years just preaching out of
[27:06] or teaching out of that
[27:08] uh sixth chapter of corinthians ii
[27:10] corinthians there's a lot of nuggets in
[27:12] there
[27:13] but i wrote i wrote something down today
[27:16] and
[27:17] you know the thing about being a good
[27:18] father a good leader a good minister or
[27:21] whatever a good friend
[27:24] is do they the thing about that
[27:27] is they have to know your mind they
[27:29] always have to know your mind they've
[27:31] got to know exactly
[27:32] what you're going to do and how you're
[27:34] going to do something
[27:36] that way they have confidence in you
[27:38] that no matter what happens you're
[27:40] always going to be
[27:41] either the same man or the same woman no
[27:44] matter what
[27:45] doesn't mean you don't have bad
[27:46] situations in your life or
[27:48] bad things or good things but in
[27:52] everything then people will have
[27:55] confidence in you
[27:57] no matter what the situation is they can
[27:59] rely on you to be
[28:01] there and do the right thing and you
[28:04] know being an old army man that
[28:06] that's an important thing your men need
[28:08] to know your mind they need to know
[28:09] exactly what you're going to do
[28:11] and when you're going to do it if they
[28:13] don't then you'll never be successful
[28:15] it's no different with being a father of
[28:17] a christian family
[28:18] whether you run a business everyone has
[28:20] to know exactly who you are and what you
[28:22] are
[28:23] and if they don't if you're wishy-washy
[28:25] they'll have no confidence in you and
[28:28] and that's why you see the world the way
[28:29] it is is because
[28:31] men and women are not consistent they
[28:33] don't
[28:34] they don't believe things the way they
[28:37] should and they don't do things the way
[28:39] they should
[28:40] but i was going to do this like i'm
[28:42] being myself you have to forgive me for
[28:44] that i can only be myself
[28:46] um this is the church church's uh
[28:48] financial report
[28:50] right now in the uh i don't mean to
[28:53] accuse
[28:54] i confuse anyone uh right now
[28:58] if i were to show you the checkbook we
[29:00] would have sixteen thousand six hundred
[29:01] and eighty eight dollars and some change
[29:04] but uh someone's made a uh missionary
[29:08] offering twice
[29:09] so with additional there's 2600
[29:12] out of that account that's not been
[29:14] earmarked any mission fund yet
[29:16] so that would leave a total unspent
[29:19] you know unallocated and there's some in
[29:22] there for the for the youth banquet too
[29:24] um of about fourteen thousand dollars
[29:28] there's
[29:28] change that's in the general fund right
[29:31] now
[29:32] and then we had a men's meeting uh we
[29:34] had a meeting of the not so much men's
[29:36] meeting but of the trustees deacons and
[29:38] the pastor a couple of months ago and we
[29:41] decided to
[29:43] try to start paying off the actual
[29:45] church loan
[29:46] and uh which i've been doing and we're
[29:49] down to
[29:50] 89 000 so out of 200
[29:54] 000 we're down to uh 89 000. the mature
[29:58] date of the loan is uh i think it's
[30:00] october of 2030.
[30:02] so uh it shouldn't be we stay
[30:06] paying 500 here 700 here we should pay
[30:09] it off a few years early
[30:12] in the building account which i make
[30:14] that a payment out and there are some
[30:16] people i've told you before
[30:18] that stole you know so put money into
[30:21] the building
[30:22] account we have uh 2100 and change
[30:26] the things that we've spent money on in
[30:28] the last several months
[30:30] as you all know we had to do that repair
[30:32] on the water
[30:33] we've had big water bills we also
[30:37] bought a building well that was in
[30:39] december january time frame we bought
[30:41] that building
[30:43] we've also bought long lawn equipment
[30:46] in for doing the lawn up here we bought
[30:49] the lawnmower before we even had covid
[30:51] we had the lawnmower before we even then
[30:54] so that's where we're at right now with
[30:57] the uh with the funds
[30:59] if you like i said if you have any
[31:01] questions
[31:02] don't be afraid to come up and ask me i
[31:04] am approachable even though i seem like
[31:06] i'm hard on the outside i am
[31:09] approachable
[31:11] uh if you would go with me to a titus
[31:17] i had that place marked this morning
[31:21] you'll have to forgive me i can talk for
[31:23] hours and not even read anything
[31:25] but um i was thinking
[31:28] us as as men and as people
[31:32] and that's what brother branham was
[31:33] talking about and i probably don't even
[31:35] have that he was talking about this
[31:37] morning in the devotional i'll just
[31:39] read a few sentences at the end he's
[31:41] talking about stephen
[31:43] about how stephen no matter what the
[31:46] pharisees were saying he held his
[31:47] testimony
[31:48] and he sealed it with his death and you
[31:51] know
[31:53] and what kind of example was that for us
[31:55] as christians or for the
[31:56] christians in his day that was a great
[31:58] example that you could be victorious in
[32:01] death or
[32:02] in life you can still be victorious i'll
[32:04] just i will read
[32:06] all of this and that's another
[32:08] anachronism of mine i say i won't read
[32:10] it all and that's all i do is read but
[32:12] i'll uh this is at the end of this day
[32:15] he said you say well
[32:16] how many was there you say there may be
[32:20] five thousand how many of them got
[32:22] he was talking about on the day of
[32:25] pentecost
[32:26] there was one that held a cold cell the
[32:29] young
[32:30] pharisee standing there and consulted
[32:32] gave witness to his death but when he
[32:34] saw the advertisement of the power of
[32:36] the resurrected christ
[32:37] and that little fellow so he's talking
[32:39] about paul was even there
[32:41] and he seen what stephen was was willing
[32:43] to do for
[32:44] for christ it made a dent in his heart
[32:48] if you never got away from him the same
[32:50] man paul
[32:51] the one standing there that morning led
[32:53] tens of thousands of souls to christ
[32:56] because one man was willing to give his
[32:58] life to be an
[32:59] advertisement board for jesus christ
[33:02] what ought to be today
[33:04] and he goes on we do not have to be we
[33:06] don't have to have a big audience
[33:08] we don't have to preach to ten thousands
[33:10] we don't have to even preach
[33:12] we can be an advertisement board how do
[33:15] you know that your life might not start
[33:18] some young man on the gospel some of you
[33:20] older men you older woman
[33:23] them young men on the field out there to
[33:26] win 10 000
[33:27] souls to christ it's because
[33:30] that they saw christ in you and it's you
[33:32] that presented it to him
[33:34] in the simple power of the gospel
[33:36] basically just being that man or being
[33:38] that woman of christ
[33:40] being that christian and living whatever
[33:43] you are
[33:44] here is the same person when you're at
[33:46] work or you're at home
[33:47] being that same consistent person and
[33:50] showing
[33:51] people that christ lives inside your
[33:53] heart and life
[33:54] that's all you really need to turn
[33:56] people from being
[33:58] bad people to good people and the only
[34:00] way that happens
[34:01] it's it's not by word it's not by deed
[34:04] it's by our relationship
[34:06] with jesus christ but i'll read this uh
[34:09] third chapter and titus here uh you know
[34:13] in the i'm not going to talk about the
[34:15] world but the world is a crazy place i
[34:17] say that a lot
[34:18] i come up here i mean a year ago i said
[34:20] look at where the world is at a year ago
[34:22] now look where we're at now
[34:24] and like brother banham said things are
[34:26] on an acceleration course
[34:29] so what would take five years to happen
[34:32] maybe three or four years ago now it's
[34:35] only
[34:36] it might only take a few weeks for the
[34:38] same thing it just keeps accelerating
[34:40] accelerating hey it all has an end point
[34:43] it has a goal it's all reaching
[34:45] to that goal which is the rapture and
[34:48] the sanctification of the soul that's
[34:50] in this church this morning or the
[34:52] destruction of the world that we live in
[34:54] it's
[34:54] you're either going one way or the other
[34:57] and that's a choice that you make this
[34:58] morning
[34:59] which way you're going to go as an
[35:01] individual but it's
[35:02] accelerating now to that point where you
[35:05] either get on the train or you're going
[35:06] to be totally left behind
[35:08] there's no more you know preachers say
[35:10] it a lot you can't play
[35:12] church anymore you you can't it's no
[35:14] more play time you either believe
[35:16] it and move with it or you're going to
[35:17] get left behind but i'll read
[35:20] what is but paul's talking here put them
[35:23] to mind to subject
[35:24] to principalities and powers to their
[35:26] magistrates
[35:27] be ready for every good work speak evil
[35:30] of no man that's really
[35:32] that speaks to the age we live and
[35:33] that's what people do is talk bad about
[35:35] each other nowadays
[35:37] it's rare it's rare to find someone that
[35:39] you work with
[35:40] that even the he knows that someone has
[35:42] bad character tries to build
[35:44] them up they just try to tear each other
[35:46] down he goes um
[35:48] and he goes speak evil oh no man i lost
[35:52] my place power to match race to be ready
[35:54] to every good work
[35:55] speak evil of no man be no brawlers but
[35:58] gentle showing all meekness on to all
[36:01] men
[36:02] you know you nowadays you'll worry if
[36:03] you get into a confrontation
[36:05] with someone if he's going to shoot you
[36:06] nowadays for ourselves also we're
[36:09] sometimes foolish
[36:10] disobedient deceived serving divers
[36:13] lusts
[36:14] and pleasures living in malice envy
[36:17] hateful and hating one another i know
[36:18] all of us can
[36:20] know in a time in our life where these
[36:22] same ideas were in us
[36:24] and we don't want to be like that
[36:26] anymore
[36:27] but after the kindness and the love of
[36:29] god our savior toward
[36:31] man appeared not by the works of right
[36:34] not by the works of righteousness which
[36:36] we have done
[36:37] but according to his mercies he saved us
[36:39] by the washing and the regeneration
[36:41] and the renewing of the holy ghost and
[36:43] if i ever say one thing in my life to
[36:45] anybody
[36:46] that talks to me about the lord i always
[36:48] say this one thing
[36:49] you know they no matter what you do how
[36:52] much
[36:53] works you have how much you try which
[36:56] are good things i'm not saying they're
[36:57] not good
[36:58] things it's it's pretty simple you have
[37:01] to totally yield yourself
[37:03] to the presence of jesus christ it's
[37:05] nothing you can do
[37:06] it's something that you got to let god
[37:08] do for you and if you're trying to do it
[37:10] in yourself
[37:11] it's never going to happen and he goes
[37:13] on to say which were shed
[37:15] on us abundantly through jesus christ
[37:17] our savior
[37:18] that being justified by his grace we
[37:20] should be made hairs
[37:22] according to the hope of eternal life
[37:24] and this is a faithful saying and these
[37:26] things i will
[37:27] that thou affirm constantly that they
[37:30] that which have believed in god might be
[37:32] careful
[37:33] to maintain good works these things are
[37:36] good and profitable
[37:37] onto men so paul's also saying here you
[37:40] should have a testimony
[37:41] in your life you shouldn't be the same
[37:44] you should be better each day you go on
[37:47] you should be a better person and doing
[37:48] better things and he goes on to say
[37:51] and this speaks to the age everyone
[37:53] wants to argue about
[37:54] everything nowadays but avoid foolish
[37:57] questions
[37:58] and genealogies contentions and
[38:00] strivings
[38:01] about the law for they are
[38:03] unprofessional in vain you can just
[38:05] you can put the new testament in there
[38:07] too you know you can argue with people
[38:09] does it ever change anything it's a they
[38:12] it has to be a revelation
[38:13] if it ain't a revelation you could talk
[38:15] to people into your blue
[38:18] and they'll never change them or they'll
[38:19] never see it your way and
[38:21] do they have to see it your way no you
[38:23] just present it to them
[38:25] and hope they see it your way and he
[38:26] goes on to say
[38:29] paul also says here man that is the
[38:31] heretic after the first and
[38:33] second automation reject knowing that he
[38:36] he is such a verdict and sinneth being
[38:39] condemned of himself
[38:40] and then i'll i'll stop there because he
[38:42] just talks about
[38:44] apollos and paul and these other people
[38:46] he's sending out
[38:47] but the only simple thing i have to say
[38:49] this morning
[38:52] i i won't i i say a lot of things that
[38:54] are
[38:55] cliches i was about to say i won't say
[38:57] the only most important thing you all
[38:59] hear this morning
[39:00] i don't know you where you're at in your
[39:02] lives you know that's the thing about a
[39:04] human being
[39:05] we see the outer man all the time we see
[39:08] that person we've known all life we see
[39:10] that outer person
[39:12] but we never know what's inside that
[39:14] inner person we don't know what's inside
[39:16] that what is suffering is or what a
[39:18] situation is
[39:19] but i can stand here and tell you
[39:20] without a doubt that i know that god
[39:22] knows who you are and i know that
[39:24] god knows what your situation is no
[39:26] matter what i say or what i believe
[39:28] if god's got a blessing for or desire
[39:30] for you i know that he can fulfill it
[39:32] in your heart and life this morning
[39:35] brother david
[39:46] man you're loving with all your heart
[39:47] let's stand this morning when i'm tossed
[39:50] online i see you sister becky
[40:07] well when i'm tossed on my sea
[40:11] and the waves cover me

[1:03:23] here and certainly uh
[1:03:25] we appreciate our fathers and and all
[1:03:27] that they do for us and
[1:03:30] we just we have a lot of confidence in
[1:03:32] our father
[1:03:33] and and not just our earthly but more
[1:03:36] confidence in our heavenly
[1:03:38] and we want to take and look at a few
[1:03:40] things that'll be all for music thank
[1:03:41] you
[1:03:42] look at a few things this morning uh
[1:03:45] kind of uh
[1:03:45] something was on my mind i feel like
[1:03:47] things have just led up to this
[1:03:48] uh with things that were said songs that
[1:03:50] were saying in the past
[1:03:52] week week and a half um things that were
[1:03:55] on my mind and i just kind of brought it
[1:03:56] into light and
[1:03:58] one thing that was said brother byler
[1:03:59] said last sunday i don't know if you
[1:04:01] caught it
[1:04:02] uh but he said when i think last sunday
[1:04:03] when he was preaching he said it seems
[1:04:05] god gets in a pickle did anybody catch
[1:04:08] him when he said that
[1:04:09] it seems god gets in a pickle and i
[1:04:12] thought man that is so true it looks
[1:04:14] like many many times throughout the
[1:04:15] scripture that god finds himself in a
[1:04:17] place
[1:04:17] that he can't get out of but when we
[1:04:20] look at the scripture we know
[1:04:22] and brother brought it out too god is
[1:04:24] always in control god is never going to
[1:04:26] get caught in a pickle
[1:04:28] uh he may look like it he may seem like
[1:04:30] it but he's always
[1:04:32] right there i want to turn in your
[1:04:34] scriptures if you would to exodus 14
[1:04:37] familiar scripture and i want to read
[1:04:39] this quote before we get started if i
[1:04:41] could
[1:04:44] brother brown says all right he said
[1:04:47] that's his word
[1:04:49] and his written word tonight
[1:04:52] is a seed listen now he says if the
[1:04:56] written word tonight is a seed
[1:04:58] that'll take life as soon as you believe
[1:05:02] his word it's just the same authority to
[1:05:08] night over all sickness is
[1:05:12] to bring your faith back to him
[1:05:15] quicken it right back see make it
[1:05:18] quickened so the word tonight is a seed
[1:05:22] and we have to realize it every time we
[1:05:24] read the word we place that seed into
[1:05:26] our hearts
[1:05:27] and we begin to nurture it and fertilize
[1:05:29] it and we begin to
[1:05:30] take that that seed and as soon as that
[1:05:33] seed if we believe that that seed is
[1:05:34] going to grow that seed is going to come
[1:05:36] forth and
[1:05:37] upon our belief all things are possible
[1:05:41] exodus 14. familiar scripture we've
[1:05:45] heard the story
[1:05:46] many many times it's not new
[1:05:49] nothing in the bible's new i i kind of
[1:05:51] get tickled a time or two when i hear
[1:05:53] people talk about well
[1:05:55] yeah i've heard that a hundred times
[1:05:57] well you know it's the foolishness of
[1:05:58] preaching
[1:05:59] it's been preached over and over and
[1:06:01] over and over
[1:06:03] but we still need it so exodus 14 and
[1:06:06] 10.
[1:06:06] let's look at verse 10.
[1:06:11] and when pharaoh drew nigh the children
[1:06:14] of israel lifted up their eyes
[1:06:16] and behold the egyptians marched after
[1:06:18] them
[1:06:19] and they were sore afraid and the
[1:06:22] children of israel cried out
[1:06:24] unto the lord and they said unto moses
[1:06:27] because there were no graves in egypt
[1:06:28] has thou taken us away to die in the
[1:06:31] wilderness
[1:06:32] wherefore has thou dealt with us to
[1:06:34] carry us forth out of egypt
[1:06:36] is not this the word that we did tell
[1:06:39] thee in egypt saying let us alone
[1:06:41] that we may serve the egyptians for it
[1:06:43] had been better for
[1:06:44] us to serve the egyptians than that we
[1:06:48] should die in the wilderness
[1:06:50] now watch moses and moses said unto
[1:06:52] these people
[1:06:53] fear ye not stand still
[1:06:57] and see the salvation of the lord
[1:07:00] which he will show to you today listen
[1:07:04] for the egyptians whom ye have seen
[1:07:06] today
[1:07:09] ye shall see
[1:07:12] what confidence moses had that god had
[1:07:15] spoken to
[1:07:16] him and placed him into a position to
[1:07:18] tell the children of israel
[1:07:19] these people that you see the enemy
[1:07:21] that's binding you the people that is
[1:07:22] holding you back and has encamped you as
[1:07:24] slaves for years and years
[1:07:26] after today you will see them know
[1:07:29] more what confidence
[1:07:32] the lord shall fight for you and ye
[1:07:34] shall hold your peace
[1:07:35] and the lord said to moses wherefore
[1:07:38] christ thou unto me
[1:07:39] speaking to the children of israel that
[1:07:40] they go forward but
[1:07:42] lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thy
[1:07:45] hand over the sea
[1:07:46] and divide it and the children of israel
[1:07:48] shall go on dry land through the midst
[1:07:51] of the sea verse 30
[1:07:54] thus the lord saved israel that day out
[1:07:57] of the hand of the egyptians
[1:07:59] and israel saw the egyptians dead
[1:08:02] upon the seashore and israel saw
[1:08:05] that great work which the lord did upon
[1:08:07] the egyptians
[1:08:09] and people feared the lord they believed
[1:08:12] the lord and his servant
[1:08:15] moses let's just pray heavenly father we
[1:08:18] thank you for this day we thank you for
[1:08:20] your grace we thank you for your mercy

[1:09:05] would draw us close to you
[1:09:07] and lord that it would give us

[1:09:31] it and the more i thought about it
[1:09:33] it's probably going to slide right in
[1:09:34] and tie right into a father's day mess
[1:09:38] this is when we talk about how great our
[1:09:40] god is
[1:09:41] how great our heavenly father is and
[1:09:44] like we said you know brother balor made
[1:09:46] that statement about jesus
[1:09:48] seems to get himself in a pickle and
[1:09:50] many times in our life we go through
[1:09:51] life and we find ourselves
[1:09:53] in a pickle we find ourselves in a mess
[1:09:56] and our life seems like it's just torn
[1:09:58] up and in turmoil
[1:09:59] and we find ourselves in a mess and
[1:10:02] brother branham says that they were
[1:10:03] standing in this place
[1:10:05] he said they were in this jeopardy and
[1:10:07] that word jeopardy it means of risk
[1:10:10] it means harm it means harms out there
[1:10:12] it's available it could even mean death
[1:10:14] so he says
[1:10:14] they're standing there in this jeopardy
[1:10:17] and they've got the mountains on this
[1:10:18] side
[1:10:19] and the red sea had cut them off and
[1:10:21] pharaoh's army marching on steadily
[1:10:24] and it seemed like all nature would
[1:10:26] scream
[1:10:27] for them so they're in a place that all
[1:10:30] of nature is looking down upon this
[1:10:32] situation as it unfolds and the prophet
[1:10:34] said that nature itself
[1:10:36] looks like they will scream for them
[1:10:39] brothers and sisters this is a dire
[1:10:41] situation that they're in a dire
[1:10:43] situation that they're in and brother
[1:10:44] branham said oh
[1:10:46] god loves to get his children in those
[1:10:49] kinds of places
[1:10:52] and he said and i'm glad of it
[1:10:57] we didn't ask for these kind of
[1:10:58] situations
[1:11:00] we didn't wake up this morning say god
[1:11:02] put me against a red sea
[1:11:04] and put an enemy a pharaoh and my
[1:11:06] enemies coming against me
[1:11:07] but he said god loves to put his
[1:11:09] children in those kinds of places
[1:11:11] i'm glad of it he said it's the greatest
[1:11:14] experience of my life when i get against
[1:11:16] something that i can't get over
[1:11:18] i can't get around i can't get under i
[1:11:20] just stand still and watch god make a
[1:11:22] way
[1:11:23] through it
[1:11:26] i stand there and watch god make a way
[1:11:29] through it he said here stood israel
[1:11:32] mountains desert pharaoh's army and the
[1:11:34] red sea
[1:11:35] what a time but it just so pleased
[1:11:38] god that's hard swallow sometimes
[1:11:43] brother brown said that he believed one
[1:11:45] writer said he looked down and he said
[1:11:46] he said it like this he looked down
[1:11:48] through the pillar of fire with angered
[1:11:52] eyes god
[1:11:54] in heavenly places looking down upon
[1:11:56] this situation pleased with where the
[1:11:58] children of israel are
[1:11:59] knowing that he's going to defeat this
[1:12:01] army of pharaoh and he looks down
[1:12:03] through a pillar of fire
[1:12:04] and through angered eyes knowing the
[1:12:07] outcome
[1:12:08] and the children of israel have
[1:12:10] themselves backed up against a wall
[1:12:12] and they're beginning to get scared
[1:12:16] the red sea got scared he said
[1:12:20] the children of israel had no reason to
[1:12:22] be scared
[1:12:24] after all they had seen in egypt what
[1:12:26] did they have to be afraid of
[1:12:28] they didn't have no reason to be scared
[1:12:29] the prophet said when the
[1:12:31] god looked down through the pillar fire
[1:12:32] with angered eyes he said the
[1:12:35] sea got scared he said the red sea got
[1:12:38] scared
[1:12:39] and it just rolled back because god's
[1:12:41] path
[1:12:42] led through it sometimes we don't
[1:12:45] understand in our life how we're going
[1:12:46] to get from point a to point b
[1:12:48] we don't know around it over and under
[1:12:50] we don't know but we know one thing
[1:12:52] god's got a way for us
[1:12:53] there it may not be the way one in our
[1:12:57] minds it may not be an easy road
[1:12:59] you may feel some pressure in your life
[1:13:02] but you're gonna make it
[1:13:06] don't worry if you're following god god
[1:13:10] will make everything
[1:13:11] stand still for you to pass through it
[1:13:14] just take his word follow his spirit
[1:13:17] he'll make things move out he'll have a
[1:13:20] house cleaning before
[1:13:21] you god is good brothers and sisters
[1:13:27] brothers and sisters how many times in
[1:13:28] our life have we found ourselves
[1:13:30] caught between the devil and the sea of
[1:13:33] life that you felt that there was
[1:13:34] hope in other words you find yourself
[1:13:37] there trapped between an impenetrable
[1:13:39] object
[1:13:40] and pharaoh and the enemies behind you
[1:13:43] the mighty enemies pushing you nowhere
[1:13:45] to run nowhere to hide
[1:13:46] no way of escape
[1:13:51] you've been where the israelites have
[1:13:52] been
[1:13:54] you've walked where the children of
[1:13:56] israel have walked you've felt there
[1:13:58] you've been
[1:13:59] you've escaped the slavery
[1:14:03] you've been in this slavery you've been
[1:14:04] in that bondage you've been right there
[1:14:06] hemmed against the red sea
[1:14:07] and the armies of egypt against you
[1:14:09] ready to kill you
[1:14:11] the armies of egypt ready to take you
[1:14:13] back to re-enslave you or to kill you
[1:14:16] into egypt
[1:14:19] you see these children of israel have
[1:14:20] been slaves for a long time
[1:14:23] these children have been raised in
[1:14:24] slavery over and over
[1:14:26] in their minds they were no more than
[1:14:28] slaves suffering in the slavery
[1:14:31] they know what their heritage is they
[1:14:32] know where their roots lay
[1:14:34] and out of sadness of this slavery they
[1:14:36] begin to cry out to god
[1:14:39] god please send something you come free
[1:14:41] as god
[1:14:43] and god begins to look down upon them
[1:14:45] and he hears their cry and he sends
[1:14:47] moses you know the glory
[1:14:51] laying a foundation here moses comes in
[1:14:54] in the situation and he begins to
[1:14:56] confront pharaoh
[1:14:58] and moses divine demands israel's
[1:15:00] release
[1:15:03] what pharaoh do yeah you just go ahead
[1:15:04] take them off no
[1:15:06] no it don't come like that now it don't
[1:15:08] come like that pharaoh refused
[1:15:11] over and over and over so much that god
[1:15:13] begins to now send plagues upon the face
[1:15:15] of the earth
[1:15:16] upon the upon egypt and he wants to
[1:15:19] punish pharaoh for his stubbornness for
[1:15:20] not letting his people go
[1:15:23] you know along about the tenth plague
[1:15:25] when all the firstborn of egypt was
[1:15:27] killed
[1:15:28] except for the israelites who was
[1:15:30] underneath the blood token
[1:15:33] egypt finally began to begin to see the
[1:15:35] picture of what god was doing
[1:15:37] god finally put him into a misha place
[1:15:40] where he says i'm going to let these
[1:15:41] people go he's going to kill every one
[1:15:42] of us
[1:15:44] so here now is pharaoh and he says to
[1:15:47] moses
[1:15:48] rise up go away from here take your
[1:15:51] people take your cows take your animals
[1:15:53] take everything and leave
[1:15:55] me now
[1:16:01] brother sister it appears at this point
[1:16:04] that that old devil's thrown in the
[1:16:06] towel
[1:16:09] he's giving up he's quit
[1:16:12] what'd you say sister johnny's no ma'am
[1:16:16] that's right she said no no
[1:16:19] he didn't give up he's not going to lay
[1:16:22] down and quit
[1:16:23] but here's the children of israel
[1:16:25] leaving egypt headed towards the
[1:16:27] promised
[1:16:28] land a land flowing with milk
[1:16:32] and honey you know the word honey in the
[1:16:36] bible means prosperity
[1:16:38] if you've got honey in the bible you're
[1:16:40] prosperous
[1:16:41] and they're going to a land where i'm
[1:16:43] fixing to prosper
[1:16:45] things are looking good everything seems
[1:16:47] good i'm
[1:16:48] free they're thinking in their minds i'm
[1:16:50] free no more bricks to make
[1:16:52] no more bondage no more orders to take
[1:16:54] no more lashing of the whips of the
[1:16:56] slaves and the task masters
[1:17:00] i'm gonna be free life is good
[1:17:05] oh it seems that way
[1:17:08] but what happened
[1:17:12] after their departure
[1:17:16] pharaoh kind of had to change heart
[1:17:19] pharaoh thinking what am i going to do
[1:17:21] about my kingdom
[1:17:23] who's going to build my monuments who's
[1:17:25] going to build
[1:17:26] the snakes who's going to build the
[1:17:28] pyramids who's going to build this
[1:17:30] kingdom of mine and raise me up and put
[1:17:32] me up on a pedestal
[1:17:33] make me look good who's going to do it i
[1:17:34] can't let these people go
[1:17:37] so he calls his commanders and says
[1:17:39] listen i want you to go get all the
[1:17:41] chariots we got
[1:17:43] over 600 armed chariots
[1:17:48] and he goes and gets all these chariots
[1:17:50] six of all the officers
[1:17:52] and he begins to pursue the devil don't
[1:17:55] roll over and die
[1:17:58] the devil's not going to just lay down
[1:18:00] and quit he's not a quitter
[1:18:02] has anybody in here ever thought in your
[1:18:05] mind
[1:18:07] that you've won a battle
[1:18:12] man i've overcome i've won the battle i
[1:18:16] tell you i'm on fire and god is good and
[1:18:19] you wake up the next morning find out
[1:18:20] the battle's still there
[1:18:24] you wake up and you find out that this
[1:18:27] war that we're in
[1:18:28] is made up of many battles and you may
[1:18:31] have prayed for deliverance
[1:18:34] and you know that god has moved on the
[1:18:36] scene
[1:18:37] you know that god has been there and but
[1:18:40] now all of a sudden you wake up and
[1:18:41] those thoughts
[1:18:42] shouldn't be happening anymore you're
[1:18:44] still there
[1:18:47] but i thought you was a christian i
[1:18:48] thought you'd give that to god i thought
[1:18:49] you laid at the altar but they're still
[1:18:51] there
[1:18:53] what's happened they're still there the
[1:18:55] anger the temper that i had
[1:18:58] it's still there
[1:19:02] just being honest that depression that
[1:19:05] fear that hate that anxiety that
[1:19:07] jealousy that doubt
[1:19:08] all those things they're back they're
[1:19:10] back they're back
[1:19:15] but god i made a move i made a move when
[1:19:19] i left my seat
[1:19:20] and come up to the altar i made a move
[1:19:23] to you god i made an exodus in my life
[1:19:26] there was an exit took place and i said
[1:19:27] i'm leaving this and i'm never going
[1:19:29] back
[1:19:35] are you with me
[1:19:41] what is that what is that
[1:19:45] when you walk away you made the move the
[1:19:46] exodus you've made an exodus in your
[1:19:48] life you've come up to the altar you've
[1:19:49] laid it down
[1:19:50] and all of a sudden you wake up and it's
[1:19:51] still there what is that
[1:19:53] that's pharaoh's army chasing you down
[1:19:56] that's pharaoh's army chasing you down
[1:19:58] to come and add you and pull you back
[1:20:00] into that torment that you just walked
[1:20:02] away from
[1:20:06] so here it happens at this egyptian army
[1:20:10] they begin to come up to the israelites
[1:20:12] at the red sea and they begin to
[1:20:14] overtake them and
[1:20:16] here's israel caught between the devil
[1:20:17] and the sea
[1:20:21] how could this happen
[1:20:25] well the first thing that we think
[1:20:26] happens in our lives is what did i do
[1:20:28] wrong
[1:20:30] what did i do wrong god where did i make
[1:20:32] the mistake i thought i'd give
[1:20:33] everything i thought i laid it all down
[1:20:35] and what did i do to come right back
[1:20:36] into this and if that's not what your
[1:20:38] thoughts if it's somebody on the outside
[1:20:40] you're in the church you're thinking
[1:20:40] what did they do wrong
[1:20:42] when you see them go right back into
[1:20:44] their ways what did they do wrong
[1:20:45] where's the sin in the camp
[1:20:48] it's our nature and they begin to wonder
[1:20:51] and we begin to wonder what is all this
[1:20:52] but brother and sister in this
[1:20:54] instance they didn't do anything wrong
[1:20:58] they didn't make one wrong move if they
[1:21:01] didn't they didn't get there at the red
[1:21:03] sea because of their poor choices
[1:21:06] they didn't get there because they took
[1:21:07] a wrong turn on the way
[1:21:09] they didn't get there because moses made
[1:21:11] a mistake
[1:21:13] and leading them out of the out of egypt
[1:21:15] that wasn't a mistake moses didn't make
[1:21:17] that mistake
[1:21:19] but what did they accuse him of moses
[1:21:23] was it because there were no graves in
[1:21:25] egypt that you've taken us into the
[1:21:26] wilderness to die
[1:21:28] what did you bring us out here for what
[1:21:29] did you bring us out of egypt wouldn't
[1:21:30] it be better for us to serve the
[1:21:32] egyptians than to die in the wilderness
[1:21:33] that's
[1:21:34] man's thinking that's the way man looks
[1:21:37] at these situations
[1:21:38] but that's not the way god looks at
[1:21:40] these situations here they are
[1:21:43] the israelites not trapped by any error
[1:21:45] of their own
[1:21:48] but look they were trapped
[1:21:51] by pharaoh's decision to pursue them
[1:21:57] that simple you know why
[1:22:01] because god said i
[1:22:04] personal pronoun i will harden pharaoh's
[1:22:08] heart
[1:22:09] and he will pursue them
[1:22:13] you mean to tell me that god
[1:22:17] the god of the children of israel
[1:22:20] hardened pharaoh's heart
[1:22:23] and made pharaoh pursue israel
[1:22:28] you mean to tell me that god was
[1:22:29] involved in pharaoh's choice
[1:22:32] that god was involved in setting this
[1:22:36] trap
[1:22:41] stay with me
[1:22:44] you see israel got caught between the
[1:22:46] devil and the red sea because
[1:22:48] god put them there
[1:22:51] god put them there it says god led the
[1:22:53] people to round about way
[1:22:55] through the wilderness to the red sea go
[1:22:57] on down and it says
[1:22:58] the refers to the angel of god who went
[1:23:01] before israel's
[1:23:02] of the israelite army leading them along
[1:23:03] the way and said
[1:23:06] god told moses tell the israelites to
[1:23:08] turn back and count
[1:23:09] by the sea
[1:23:13] wow and over over and over and over but
[1:23:16] we forget that god is in control of
[1:23:18] every situation no matter how
[1:23:20] bad the outcome looks god is in control
[1:23:24] so it's very clear
[1:23:25] god is involved god is in control so if
[1:23:27] you find yourself in a difficult place
[1:23:29] maybe you're there because god put
[1:23:32] you there
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:36] just maybe god put you there for a
[1:23:39] specific purpose
[1:23:41] maybe god put you for his purpose maybe
[1:23:43] why did god put israel in such a
[1:23:45] difficult and dangerous place why did he
[1:23:48] put him there between the devil and the
[1:23:49] red sea
[1:23:50] he put him there because he wanted to
[1:23:51] show the devil that he's going to defeat
[1:23:52] him
[1:23:53] and he wanted to bring glory to himself
[1:23:55] and he wanted to build their
[1:24:00] faith
[1:24:02] we need faith as believers we need
[1:24:06] faith let me tell you why we need faith
[1:24:08] we believe in a resurrection
[1:24:11] that the dead in christ shall rise let's
[1:24:14] take a step forward we believe
[1:24:15] in a rapture you got to have a lot of
[1:24:19] faith to believe that
[1:24:22] to people that don't believe this to
[1:24:24] atheists and people we are lunatics
[1:24:27] we're howling at the moon okay so it
[1:24:30] takes a lot of effect for us to get
[1:24:32] ourselves up there we have to put
[1:24:33] ourselves in such a place
[1:24:34] that our faith gets built and built and
[1:24:36] built and the prophet said that
[1:24:38] sometimes god puts us in those places
[1:24:40] proving to listen listen to who to prove
[1:24:44] to the weakest of christians
[1:24:48] that you can defeat satan anywhere
[1:24:51] anytime with the simple plain word of
[1:24:56] god
[1:24:59] how many is the wicked christian i'll
[1:25:00] raise my hand
[1:25:03] i'm a weak christian i
[1:25:06] fail daily so i need god i need to be
[1:25:10] put in those kind of situations even
[1:25:12] though i don't like them so that god
[1:25:13] continually lifts my faith up and says
[1:25:15] you can make it you can make it you can
[1:25:17] make it you win
[1:25:19] so many times this word we hear you lose
[1:25:21] you lose you lose you're not going to
[1:25:23] make it you're no good you're no count
[1:25:25] but god's trying to tell you you're
[1:25:26] going to make it you're going to win
[1:25:29] brother and sister god wanted to
[1:25:31] increase israel's faith by demonstrating
[1:25:33] his power on their behalf
[1:25:36] so he brings them up to the sea and he
[1:25:39] takes and he parts the water
[1:25:41] and the children of israel go walking
[1:25:43] along on dry land with walls
[1:25:45] of water you know there's people that
[1:25:48] try to disprove it and they try to say
[1:25:50] they walked across on a dry spot they
[1:25:52] walked across on reeded ground where the
[1:25:54] reeds were it was a dry
[1:25:55] drought it was this that the other but
[1:25:57] the bible that i read tells me that
[1:25:59] there was
[1:25:59] walls of water
[1:26:03] walls of water so great that when they
[1:26:05] walked across
[1:26:07] and the army of egypt follow him across
[1:26:10] that when moses waved his south again
[1:26:13] the walls consumed
[1:26:15] the egypt army
[1:26:18] and the bible says that not one of
[1:26:22] them remain
[1:26:26] what was the effect of this on israel
[1:26:29] israel began to see a great work
[1:26:31] israel began to see what god was doing
[1:26:32] for them and they remembered what god
[1:26:34] saw what
[1:26:35] moses said when he said fear not in our
[1:26:37] first scripture for this today
[1:26:39] these people you see you will see them
[1:26:41] no more ever
[1:26:44] here's god's word the spoken word that
[1:26:46] was given to moses
[1:26:47] and moses put it out there now coming to
[1:26:49] pass and the
[1:26:50] israel have to look at and say oh my
[1:26:52] goodness
[1:26:54] we've arrived
[1:26:59] brother sister don't forget the great
[1:27:02] works in your life
[1:27:04] don't ever forget the great works that
[1:27:06] god has done in your life
[1:27:09] like i said there's many times people
[1:27:11] will try to put you down
[1:27:13] they will try to downplay walk with god
[1:27:15] they will try to make you less than what
[1:27:17] god has you at
[1:27:18] but don't ever let that begin first in
[1:27:20] your mind don't ever
[1:27:21] let build and build and build off your
[1:27:23] experiences with god did god save your
[1:27:25] soul
[1:27:26] build on it did god deliver you from
[1:27:29] cigarettes
[1:27:30] build on it did god deliver you from
[1:27:32] alcohol build on it did god deliver you
[1:27:34] from lying and hatred
[1:27:36] build on it nobody put you back
[1:27:39] to egypt because those
[1:27:42] remain no more
[1:27:50] your faith will get stronger and
[1:27:52] stronger
[1:27:53] and stronger if god puts you between the
[1:27:57] devil and the red sea of life
[1:28:00] it's a personal experience to you it's
[1:28:04] your
[1:28:04] personal experience at the red sea so
[1:28:07] that he can deliver you so that you can
[1:28:08] build your faith
[1:28:09] and whenever god puts you in a hard
[1:28:11] place like that he's not going to
[1:28:13] defeat the devil by working in some kind
[1:28:16] of miracle
[1:28:17] and deliverance on your behalf or he's
[1:28:20] going to glorify himself
[1:28:21] in the eyes of others as they watch how
[1:28:23] you walk through that trial
[1:28:27] and then he's going to build your faith
[1:28:28] and increase your faith as you
[1:28:30] leaned upon him in a time of trial and
[1:28:32] trouble
[1:28:35] so what we have to do is learn to
[1:28:39] do what the children of israel did in
[1:28:42] the times of trouble we have to learn to
[1:28:44] call
[1:28:44] god on the scene and if i was going to
[1:28:48] title this anything today it would be
[1:28:49] calling god
[1:28:50] on the scene because brother says that's
[1:28:52] the first thing they
[1:28:53] did when the pressure came they called
[1:28:56] out to god
[1:28:57] and i can imagine from a distance that
[1:28:59] they could hear
[1:29:01] those horses hooves in the background
[1:29:04] and as they looked over their shoulder
[1:29:05] they see the billowing clouds of dust
[1:29:07] and the nostrils of the horses flare
[1:29:09] coming as hard as they can
[1:29:15] looking into the eyes of those soldiers
[1:29:18] and warriors
[1:29:20] that we're going to pull them back
[1:29:23] to the life they just left
[1:29:26] gonna pull them back into a sinful
[1:29:28] condition
[1:29:30] satan now that's the way he works gonna
[1:29:32] pull them back
[1:29:34] so the first thing they did in exodus 14
[1:29:36] they cried out as pharaoh drew neal the
[1:29:38] israelites looked back
[1:29:40] and they saw the egyptians advancing
[1:29:41] upon them and in great fear the
[1:29:43] israelites cried out to the lord
[1:29:47] you see prayer puts us in touch with the
[1:29:49] resources of heaven
[1:29:52] do you know that prayer is your conduit
[1:29:53] to god
[1:29:56] and i'll tell you what i find myself
[1:29:58] some sometimes so many times
[1:30:02] that i don't have the conduit flowing
[1:30:06] to god the way it should
[1:30:09] we get busy in life you know we talk
[1:30:11] about that a lot but it's the truth
[1:30:13] we have if you want to get close to god
[1:30:15] we have to have that conduit between god
[1:30:17] and keep going and keep going to god
[1:30:19] because in jeremiah 33 3
[1:30:21] it says god says call unto me and i will
[1:30:23] ask thee and show
[1:30:25] fighting things which thou knowest
[1:30:29] not we don't even know the mightiness of
[1:30:33] god
[1:30:35] we can't even fathom what god is capable
[1:30:37] of doing
[1:30:38] you think about this red sea situation
[1:30:41] that's uncomprehendable
[1:30:44] but god did it and god can continue to
[1:30:47] do that so
[1:30:48] when we're in these problems and when we
[1:30:49] things going on we need to pray
[1:30:52] we need to call god on the scene quit
[1:30:54] our grumbling and complaining
[1:30:57] because that's exactly what what got
[1:30:58] them in trouble they said to moses were
[1:31:00] there no graves in egypt
[1:31:02] did you bring us out here until we could
[1:31:04] die in the wilderness wouldn't it be
[1:31:05] better if we were in egypt
[1:31:07] and serving this the egyptians
[1:31:10] brother and sister prayer puts you in
[1:31:13] touch with the power of god
[1:31:16] so if prayer puts you in touch the power
[1:31:18] of god what does bumbling and
[1:31:20] complaining do
[1:31:23] it shuts that conduit down that conduit
[1:31:27] between you and god as you're praying
[1:31:29] and he's listening and he's answering
[1:31:30] and you feel his presence and you feel
[1:31:32] it
[1:31:32] you feel the deliverance you feel that
[1:31:34] to us and then all of a sudden well i
[1:31:35] tell you what if i could have done this
[1:31:37] i would have done
[1:31:38] different if i would have done this or
[1:31:39] if they hadn't said this i wouldn't be
[1:31:41] here
[1:31:42] and complaining the preacher preaches
[1:31:43] too long the music's too loud the
[1:31:45] drummer hits the snare
[1:31:47] grumbling and complaining
[1:31:52] you pinch that conduit down god can't
[1:31:55] hear you
[1:31:57] when you're grumbling and complaining
[1:31:59] why would god listen to that
[1:32:04] well
[1:32:07] he'll put up with it for a while
[1:32:10] yeah he'll put up with it for a while
[1:32:12] he'll get by with it for a little while
[1:32:13] that's what he did in this situation the
[1:32:15] children vision they grumble to complain
[1:32:16] did you ever see in the bible where he
[1:32:18] said anything about it to him
[1:32:20] not in this situation but what happened
[1:32:21] in numbers 11 when they began to grumble
[1:32:24] and complain
[1:32:25] they they begin to grumble and complain
[1:32:27] and they complain and it says the lord
[1:32:29] heard their grumbling complaining and
[1:32:30] was
[1:32:31] anger kindled against them
[1:32:36] it says then the fire of the lord burned
[1:32:38] against
[1:32:39] them brothers and sisters let me tell
[1:32:42] you something we don't want the fire of
[1:32:45] god
[1:32:46] burning against us we want the fire of
[1:32:48] god burning against our enemies the one
[1:32:50] that's pushing us
[1:32:51] and trying to get us to come back that's
[1:32:53] where we want that so we need to quit
[1:32:54] our murmuring quit our complaining
[1:32:56] paul says do all things without
[1:32:59] murmuring
[1:33:01] and arguing so that you may be blameless
[1:33:04] and innocent
[1:33:05] children of god without blemish
[1:33:10] in the midst of what a crooked and
[1:33:13] perverse
[1:33:14] generation i believe i heard somebody
[1:33:16] mention something about the generation
[1:33:18] we're living in now believer brian
[1:33:19] before service talked about
[1:33:20] the day we live in the perversion the
[1:33:22] wickedness the crookedness
[1:33:24] no murmuring no complaining
[1:33:29] when we call god on the scene amazing
[1:33:33] things happen
[1:33:36] we're going to talk about some of the
[1:33:37] amazing things that's happened we just
[1:33:39] talked about the children of israel at
[1:33:40] the red sea
[1:33:42] but let's look at here when jesus comes
[1:33:44] and he's been teaching all day
[1:33:46] and he's in the he's been at the uh
[1:33:48] going through the parables that he's
[1:33:49] tired and he's exhausted and he says
[1:33:51] let's cross over to the other side of
[1:33:52] the lake
[1:33:54] and so jesus gets in a boat and him and
[1:33:57] his disciples they start out across the
[1:33:58] sea
[1:33:59] and leave him behind them the crowd
[1:34:01] they're trying to follow him still
[1:34:03] they've loaded their boats and they're
[1:34:04] going where jesus is going
[1:34:07] they're going to follow jesus anywhere
[1:34:08] he goes but then all of a sudden a
[1:34:10] fierce storm comes up
[1:34:13] so here's the storm comes up and these
[1:34:15] high waves were breaking into the boat
[1:34:17] and the boat began to fill with water
[1:34:19] and jesus was in the back of the boat
[1:34:21] sleeping
[1:34:23] with his head on a
[1:34:26] cushion they're afraid they're going to
[1:34:28] drown so they come up and jesus they
[1:34:30] wake him up
[1:34:31] and says jesus jesus wake up and he says
[1:34:33] silence
[1:34:34] be still think about this
[1:34:39] silence be still these men
[1:34:43] fishermen were completely terrified and
[1:34:46] they look at this and they think who
[1:34:48] is this man they'd seen him work they'd
[1:34:51] seen his teachings they'd seen some
[1:34:52] miracles
[1:34:53] but here now their life was in jeopardy
[1:34:56] their life is in jeopardy and brothers
[1:34:58] and sisters this storm came this fierce
[1:35:00] storm and what are storms their tests
[1:35:03] the storms of life are the tests and you
[1:35:05] and then when you go through these
[1:35:06] storms you'll discover yourself
[1:35:08] exactly what you're made of storms have
[1:35:11] a way about revealing the truth about
[1:35:13] who you are
[1:35:14] on the inside you either live by fear or
[1:35:16] you live by faith
[1:35:18] storms reveal if your heart is full of
[1:35:21] trust or full of doubt
[1:35:24] storms the way you react to god during a
[1:35:26] storm
[1:35:27] reveals whether you want him or you
[1:35:30] don't
[1:35:34] storms happen suddenly
[1:35:38] storms happen suddenly the bible says in
[1:35:41] verse 37
[1:35:42] the soon a fierce
[1:35:45] storm came up we look up fierce there it
[1:35:49] means seismic
[1:35:51] now we use the word seismic to describe
[1:35:53] our earthquakes
[1:35:54] we have seismic activity
[1:36:00] of galilee somewhere about 13 miles wide
[1:36:03] seven seven miles deep 150 50
[1:36:06] down to the bottom and here they are
[1:36:09] with this size
[1:36:10] activity on the water
[1:36:15] not a fun place to be not a fun place to
[1:36:19] be
[1:36:21] did jesus know this storm was coming
[1:36:25] absolutely why would we doubt that he
[1:36:27] did
[1:36:29] but this storm of life was part of the
[1:36:31] disciples
[1:36:32] lesson this norm of life was part of the
[1:36:35] disciples lesson
[1:36:36] to teach something about god and to
[1:36:39] teach them something about themselves
[1:36:43] fierce the storm was fierce
[1:36:50] and suddenly quickly
[1:36:55] that's the way life is
[1:36:59] one minute everything is good
[1:37:03] one minute everything is fine
[1:37:07] and the next minute the bottom falls out
[1:37:13] it takes one phone call and your world
[1:37:16] is turned upside down
[1:37:18] it takes one doctor's visit and you see
[1:37:21] a seismic activity in your life
[1:37:24] your world begins to shake your earth
[1:37:26] begins to quake you're in the middle of
[1:37:28] a storm
[1:37:31] one conversation and you're shaken
[1:37:37] that's the reality brothers and sisters
[1:37:39] one conversation and your life
[1:37:42] is changed and what happens many times
[1:37:44] in storms
[1:37:45] storms it could cause people to begin to
[1:37:48] doubt
[1:37:48] god storms begin to make us doubt god
[1:37:53] jesus was sleeping in the back of the
[1:37:54] boat with his head on the cushion and
[1:37:56] they wake him up shouting teacher don't
[1:37:58] you
[1:37:58] care what about to happen to us don't
[1:38:01] you care what's going on the storm
[1:38:03] island the sea is shaking
[1:38:06] these hurricane winds are blowing our
[1:38:08] boat in all directions
[1:38:09] don't you care we're talking about
[1:38:12] experienced fishermen here
[1:38:15] they knew the sea they knew how to
[1:38:16] maneuver a boat they knew how to handle
[1:38:18] the situations like this but here they
[1:38:20] are in a panic
[1:38:22] this is more than they've ever dealt
[1:38:24] with and jesus is in the back of the
[1:38:26] boat asleep what kind of man is this
[1:38:31] teacher don't you care that we're going
[1:38:32] to drown
[1:38:35] their first concern was drowning
[1:38:38] many times we get in our life and things
[1:38:40] begin to smother in on us
[1:38:43] and we feel like we're rounding in live
[1:38:45] situations
[1:38:46] we feel like life is coming down upon us
[1:38:49] and the sea is raging and we got that
[1:38:51] seismic earthquake activity
[1:38:52] and things are raining on us and we're
[1:38:54] beginning to suffocate and drown
[1:38:59] but this was a classroom this was more
[1:39:02] than the sea of galilee this was a
[1:39:04] classroom
[1:39:05] this was a place where god had him in a
[1:39:07] place where he could sit there and he
[1:39:09] began to teach them the real
[1:39:10] storms of life you know life is the
[1:39:13] storms of
[1:39:15] life are easy when we're in setting in
[1:39:17] church
[1:39:18] and the preacher's preaching you think
[1:39:19] man are you i can associate with that
[1:39:21] yeah that's me i've been there i've done
[1:39:22] that i've done this
[1:39:23] but what is it what kind of education is
[1:39:25] it when you lose a loved one
[1:39:28] what kind of education is it when you
[1:39:30] can't pay your bills
[1:39:32] what kind of education is it when your
[1:39:34] health begins to leave your
[1:39:37] what kind of education is it when your
[1:39:39] marriage falls apart
[1:39:42] that's a storm that's a size a storm of
[1:39:45] seismic activity brothers and sisters
[1:39:47] that's when god puts us in a place in
[1:39:49] the middle of that storm and that's when
[1:39:51] we have to be able to call blood on the
[1:39:53] sea
[1:39:54] that's when we have to have that
[1:39:55] communication that khan do when they
[1:39:57] said jesus
[1:39:58] wake up and we got to be able to call
[1:40:00] jesus on the scene in our storms of life
[1:40:02] and he comes in and says
[1:40:03] when be still
[1:40:08] right
[1:40:12] let me ask you this question
[1:40:15] you're gonna like this i got got message
[1:40:18] believers in here right
[1:40:20] you're gonna like this let me ask you
[1:40:22] this question if jesus knew the storm
[1:40:24] was coming he knew the dangers that left
[1:40:26] the head why would he put his disciples
[1:40:28] in that situation
[1:40:30] why would he risk it why would he go
[1:40:32] through that knowing that things were
[1:40:34] coming
[1:40:35] was it to teach those guys a lesson yeah
[1:40:38] was it teach those guys to rely on him
[1:40:40] yes was it to teach him
[1:40:41] how powerful he was yes
[1:40:44] there was another story taking place
[1:40:50] night or two before that he crossed the
[1:40:52] seas this is the prophet speaking
[1:40:54] he's been very weary and he had stealed
[1:40:56] the sea for them crossed way over into
[1:40:58] gudera
[1:41:01] crossed way over into gudera and there
[1:41:02] was a maniac
[1:41:04] taking the chance of crossing that
[1:41:06] stormy sea
[1:41:07] when the devils of the sea swore that
[1:41:10] they
[1:41:10] would drown him
[1:41:15] but he went there listen
[1:41:19] at the cry of one
[1:41:22] person
[1:41:27] these fishermen went through a storm of
[1:41:30] life
[1:41:31] jesus had a purpose
[1:41:35] they learned a lesson sure but jesus is
[1:41:37] constantly moving he's moving from place
[1:41:39] to place he's just constantly being
[1:41:40] about the father's business
[1:41:42] at the cry of one person
[1:41:45] one poor maniac lost his mind perhaps a
[1:41:47] good man one time
[1:41:49] walked up right before god but probably
[1:41:52] got in the wrong crowd
[1:41:54] he might be started in drinking in
[1:41:56] something and lost his mind
[1:41:58] now he lives out there in the tombs
[1:41:59] where the demons lived
[1:42:01] they put him in chains but he had
[1:42:03] supernatural powers he'd break those
[1:42:05] chains
[1:42:05] and jump on man and beat them and kill
[1:42:08] them if he could
[1:42:09] when they come by that poor fella
[1:42:14] you want to know how god was called on
[1:42:15] the scene
[1:42:19] how did god know close probably some of
[1:42:23] that too
[1:42:24] brother branham said he had an old
[1:42:25] gray-headed mother somewhere
[1:42:30] she knew how to get a hold of god an old
[1:42:32] gray-headed mother somewhere that was
[1:42:34] praying for him
[1:42:35] and jesus he said cross that sea all the
[1:42:38] way over into godera to give
[1:42:40] mercy to one man
[1:42:44] what a god we serve what a god we serve
[1:42:48] this man he said was a sociable god
[1:42:51] fearing man there could be anybody
[1:42:53] sitting in this room
[1:42:55] a sociable god fearing man but he got
[1:42:57] out with the wrong
[1:42:58] crowd he had one two three kids i think
[1:43:01] he's
[1:43:02] at home married fine little wife at home
[1:43:06] that could be anybody sitting here
[1:43:10] but the prayers of an old gray-headed
[1:43:12] mother
[1:43:13] praying for him and here's this fellow
[1:43:16] legion
[1:43:19] no hopes living in the tombs with the
[1:43:23] devils now
[1:43:24] year after year getting worse and worse
[1:43:26] and worse so that no man could pass by
[1:43:29] without him hurting them
[1:43:34] here's a man now excommunicated from his
[1:43:37] city
[1:43:38] excommunicated from his wife his
[1:43:41] children
[1:43:42] his mother the whole town
[1:43:46] pushed him on the outside
[1:43:51] the darkest hour
[1:43:54] man we've been up against the red sea
[1:43:57] with pharaoh breathing down our back
[1:44:01] we've been in a storm a raging storm
[1:44:04] when the activity seemed like there was
[1:44:06] no way you could make it and now
[1:44:08] here the darkest hour of a man's life
[1:44:14] the darkest hour of a man's life and
[1:44:17] jesus comes up there and steps onto the
[1:44:19] land of gadara
[1:44:20] and jesus is confronted he runs out to
[1:44:22] him
[1:44:25] jesus asks him his name
[1:44:32] legion legion
[1:44:38] you understand this is probably the most
[1:44:44] terrifying account of demon possession
[1:44:46] in all the bible
[1:44:51] this man who once had a home now lives
[1:44:53] in the cemetery
[1:44:55] and y'all want to live there i don't
[1:44:57] think so i'm out
[1:45:00] peace living in a cemetery
[1:45:03] his home is now within the tombs
[1:45:07] helpless a man of society helpless
[1:45:11] a man of wealth at one time naked
[1:45:14] a man who was exceeding fierce in his
[1:45:17] life
[1:45:18] totally unmanageable constantly crying
[1:45:22] and cutting himself
[1:45:24] torturing himself these days what's on
[1:45:26] the inside of him
[1:45:31] driven by a legion of demons
[1:45:36] my name is legion
[1:45:39] this let me tell you this wasn't
[1:45:42] somebody who just stepped away
[1:45:45] this wasn't somebody who just fell from
[1:45:47] grace for a minute
[1:45:49] this wasn't somebody who just backslid
[1:45:52] for a day or two legion when you look up
[1:45:56] the name
[1:45:56] legion it means 6 000
[1:46:00] demons 6

[1:46:10] wrap your wrap your mind around that for
[1:46:11] a minute

[1:46:15] day to day but this man has six
[1:46:17] thousand demons six thousand demons that
[1:46:20] are pushing him
[1:46:21] and making him act the way he is that
[1:46:22] has completely taken him away from the
[1:46:24] life he once knew the good life
[1:46:26] a life a god-fearing man the prophet
[1:46:28] said and has taken him away
[1:46:31] brothers and sisters he needed god on
[1:46:33] the scene
[1:46:35] that greyhead had wanted called god onto
[1:46:37] the scene jesus crossed the raging sea
[1:46:39] and he takes legion by the hand and
[1:46:41] delivers him those demonic spirits go
[1:46:43] into the swine
[1:46:44] over the cliff they go
[1:46:47] look at the difference this wretched
[1:46:49] demonic man's conversion to christ
[1:46:52] he's now sitting not screaming
[1:46:56] he's sitting he's praising not cursing
[1:46:59] he's dressed not naked he's in his right
[1:47:01] mind not insane he's converted to christ
[1:47:04] and not a captive of satan no longer
[1:47:07] brother sisters that's what god has done
[1:47:09] for us
[1:47:10] god has come down and delivered us from
[1:47:12] all demonic powers
[1:47:14] all the legions that you could face and
[1:47:16] god has put you in a place
[1:47:17] that you can go be a witness for him
[1:47:22] use what god has given you witness for
[1:47:24] him
[1:47:25] many preachers type this story how a
[1:47:27] madman became a missionary
[1:47:32] how a madman became a missionary how was
[1:47:35] that
[1:47:37] you know in many of the many of the time
[1:47:40] jesus touches somebody he heals somebody
[1:47:42] he opens blinded eyes he raises somebody
[1:47:44] from dead and what's he tell them
[1:47:45] don't tell nobody
[1:47:49] don't tell nobody but here
[1:47:53] he told him he said you go and tell
[1:47:56] everybody
[1:47:57] what i've done for you you go tell
[1:47:59] everybody what jesus has done for you
[1:48:01] and how good he's done to you and what
[1:48:02] did he do he departed and went to the
[1:48:04] capitalist
[1:48:05] and he began to write about the good
[1:48:07] things of god let me tell you decapolis
[1:48:09] was a ten
[1:48:10] city area he didn't just go to his
[1:48:13] hometown
[1:48:13] he went right back to the big big town
[1:48:16] to the cities and he began to witness
[1:48:17] what god
[1:48:18] has delivered me from i was that man in
[1:48:20] the tomb
[1:48:21] i was that man that was cutting myself i
[1:48:24] was that man that had to leave my wife
[1:48:25] and kids
[1:48:27] but god was called on the scene
[1:48:32] brother branham said the darkest hour
[1:48:35] then jesus came along
[1:48:37] he said could you imagine lead legion
[1:48:39] going back down to his home
[1:48:41] and finding where he used to live the
[1:48:44] little wife had to sell her place
[1:48:47] and he wondered where she was at
[1:48:51] and he began to search from place to
[1:48:53] place
[1:48:54] and he said finally someone said she
[1:48:55] lives down in the alley
[1:48:58] and he said legion goes down there into
[1:49:00] that little 0-10 shack
[1:49:01] and he sees the children coming and they
[1:49:04] run to hide
[1:49:06] they remember who legion was
[1:49:10] they remember what he acted like they
[1:49:12] remember how he treated them
[1:49:15] and they run to hide and said his wife
[1:49:17] picked up her shawl and she ran
[1:49:18] out there to the gate and he said never
[1:49:21] mind honey
[1:49:22] never mind the children come here to
[1:49:26] daddy
[1:49:28] i want to take you in my arms
[1:49:31] i want to put my arms around you
[1:49:33] sweetheart
[1:49:36] and she said what happened
[1:49:40] what happened
[1:49:44] and he looks at her he says jesus
[1:49:47] came along
[1:49:51] jesus came along that's what made the
[1:49:53] difference wife
[1:49:55] he's come to me it was in my darkest
[1:49:57] hour the devil tormented me
[1:49:59] to no end and jesus came along
[1:50:05] a little gray-haired mother praying for
[1:50:07] her son was able to call jesus on the
[1:50:09] scene we got to be able to call jesus on
[1:50:11] the scene this morning
[1:50:17] mark 5 21.
[1:50:20] i don't even know what time i started so
[1:50:22] i don't know what time to quit
[1:50:26] mark 5 and jesus was passed over again
[1:50:30] by a ship until the other side much
[1:50:33] people gathered unto him and
[1:50:34] not unto the sea and behold he cometh
[1:50:38] one of the rulers of the synagogue
[1:50:40] jairus by name and he saw him and he
[1:50:42] fell at his feet
[1:50:44] and besought him greatly saying my
[1:50:45] little girl lies at the point of death i
[1:50:47] pray thee come
[1:50:49] and lay thy hands on her that she may be
[1:50:51] healed
[1:50:52] and so that she may live and jesus went
[1:50:55] with him and much people followed him
[1:50:58] and thronged him
[1:51:01] so here we have this religious leader
[1:51:03] now jairus
[1:51:05] and his daughter went in on her deathbed
[1:51:08] and he goes and he finds see jesus and
[1:51:11] he seeks him out and he begins to tell
[1:51:12] him about his situation
[1:51:13] now i want you to notice that jared
[1:51:15] spoke in his faith
[1:51:18] that's what attracted jesus to his story
[1:51:22] he made a commitment to come and find
[1:51:24] him and fell down at his feet and said
[1:51:25] if you come and you lay your hands on my
[1:51:27] daughter i believe she will be made
[1:51:29] well so jesus says okay let's go let's
[1:51:32] do this
[1:51:33] and jesus is walking down there through
[1:51:35] the city they're making their way
[1:51:36] through the multitude
[1:51:37] and a woman comes up behind jesus and
[1:51:40] secretly touches the hem of his garment
[1:51:43] a touch of faith she touches him and
[1:51:45] jesus asked
[1:51:46] who touches me and his disciples says
[1:51:50] lord you see these crowd of people
[1:51:53] they're all touching you they're
[1:51:54] everywhere they're bumping into
[1:51:55] everybody everybody's touching he said
[1:51:57] no no no no
[1:51:58] it's not that kind of a touch this is a
[1:52:01] touch that pulled virtue from me
[1:52:03] this is a touch that has felt different
[1:52:05] because virtue has left me
[1:52:07] somebody is calling me onto the scene
[1:52:10] somebody has a need from me somebody is
[1:52:13] going to be
[1:52:14] what i'm going to be what they need me
[1:52:15] to be
[1:52:18] now put yourself in jairus place
[1:52:23] he has run to jesus to get a hold of him
[1:52:26] to bring him back to his daughter and
[1:52:27] now jesus suddenly stopped
[1:52:30] and jesus has stopped in the middle of
[1:52:32] this scene and his daughter is at
[1:52:33] death's door
[1:52:34] and he's probably thinking jesus come on
[1:52:36] hurry up please hurry up i need you to
[1:52:38] come as quick as possible she's at that
[1:52:39] store she's going to die any moment i'm
[1:52:41] going to lose my daughter
[1:52:45] and this woman has touched the hem of
[1:52:47] his garment
[1:52:49] and jesus stops to minister to her
[1:52:54] isn't it funny how we think we can
[1:52:56] control what what jesus does what god
[1:52:58] does and when he's going to do it
[1:53:03] and she's touching the hem of his
[1:53:04] garment
[1:53:07] and jerry's standing there thinking this
[1:53:10] isn't fair
[1:53:13] this isn't fair is life always fair
[1:53:17] no life's not fair
[1:53:20] but that's life
[1:53:23] and jesus is ministering here to this
[1:53:25] woman and jerius is thinking then this
[1:53:27] woman's been sick for 12
[1:53:29] years she has lingered on for 12 years
[1:53:33] and my daughter
[1:53:34] is dying my 12 year old sweetheart is
[1:53:38] laying there dying i come to you first
[1:53:40] jesus
[1:53:41] come and heal my daughter you shouldn't
[1:53:45] even be attending to this woman
[1:53:49] she don't have a right to be here by the
[1:53:52] levitical law
[1:53:54] she should be stoned to death for having
[1:53:55] a blood issue
[1:53:57] and now jesus is ministering to her
[1:54:00] jesus is talking to her isn't that
[1:54:03] something how our minds work
[1:54:06] we need god more than anybody right our
[1:54:08] situation is greater than yours
[1:54:11] my need is greater than yours god come
[1:54:14] on the scene they can wait
[1:54:18] jesus has taken up all this precious
[1:54:21] time with the social
[1:54:22] outcast
[1:54:25] proven that he's no respecter of person
[1:54:30] he doesn't care about your background he
[1:54:33] doesn't care where you're from he
[1:54:36] doesn't care
[1:54:36] what what county you live in he doesn't
[1:54:38] care who your parents are he doesn't
[1:54:40] care if you're a royalty he doesn't care
[1:54:42] if you're a vagabond he cares about your
[1:54:44] soul
[1:54:46] and this woman came in contact with
[1:54:48] jesus in such a place that she laid
[1:54:50] her finger on his garments
[1:54:54] and said i need you on the scene
[1:54:58] years years she'd waited
[1:55:05] did jairus panic boy how about he was
[1:55:08] thinking some things
[1:55:11] but nope panic jesus is talking with
[1:55:14] this woman
[1:55:16] and while jesus is talking to this woman
[1:55:19] a messenger comes to jairus and says
[1:55:23] jairus i hate to
[1:55:27] tell you this but your daughter has died
[1:55:32] your daughter didn't make it we called
[1:55:35] the doctors
[1:55:36] the doctors came they tried everything
[1:55:38] they done everything they know to do
[1:55:40] but your daughter has died
[1:55:44] jesus is ministering to this lady
[1:55:48] and jesus hears the messenger talk to
[1:55:51] jairus
[1:55:52] about his daughter being dead and he
[1:55:55] turns to him and says
[1:55:57] don't be afraid only believe
[1:56:03] put yourself there you've just run
[1:56:07] a marathon to get to somebody that you
[1:56:09] think can lay his hands on your daughter
[1:56:11] and
[1:56:11] and make her well and now you've just
[1:56:14] been told by a messenger that she didn't
[1:56:16] make it she's gone she's not coming back
[1:56:18] she's dead as dead can be
[1:56:21] that's the reality of it and jesus looks
[1:56:23] at you and says don't be afraid
[1:56:25] only believe
[1:56:31] don't panic just act like you would
[1:56:35] if she wasn't dead
[1:56:40] boys
[1:56:42] as far as jesus was concerned
[1:56:45] death wasn't a challenge death is not a
[1:56:49] challenge to jesus
[1:56:50] death is not a child it's not an
[1:56:52] obstacle it's no different than sickness
[1:56:53] or blindness or deafness or
[1:56:55] cancer heart trouble it's no different
[1:56:58] than any of those things
[1:56:59] death is just a thing and he is in
[1:57:03] control
[1:57:04] and he knew that he has the power to
[1:57:05] restore her health
[1:57:07] and if he had the power to restore his
[1:57:09] he's got the power to raise but from the
[1:57:11] dead
[1:57:11] so jairus don't panic don't panic
[1:57:15] don't let that sudden unreasonable
[1:57:17] outpower fear come over you
[1:57:23] jesus is the messiah standing by jairus
[1:57:25] and he says trust me
[1:57:28] we have no factual evidence that she's
[1:57:30] going to be dead
[1:57:31] when we get there can you imagine
[1:57:34] walking back to that house
[1:57:37] can you imagine the road back to that
[1:57:39] house and jesus
[1:57:40] walking with you and said there's no
[1:57:43] reason to fear
[1:57:47] you see brother and sister when you're
[1:57:48] hand in hand with jesus
[1:57:52] there's no report bad enough that will
[1:57:54] change your situation
[1:57:58] god is in control when you're hand in
[1:58:00] hand with god
[1:58:03] you're in hand in hand with the master
[1:58:05] of the universe
[1:58:12] don't panic we have no evidence
[1:58:20] satan knows we'll go this direction for
[1:58:24] a minute
[1:58:25] satan knows that he can drive out your
[1:58:29] faith
[1:58:30] with fear
[1:58:34] you can have the most abundant amount of
[1:58:36] faith that you're ready to
[1:58:38] to to take on uh to cross a raging sea
[1:58:42] you can have enough faith to think you
[1:58:43] can walk on water
[1:58:46] but once jesus or once satan puts fear
[1:58:48] in you
[1:58:49] everything you think about jesus cost
[1:58:51] consistently goes down
[1:58:54] peter walk on the water
[1:58:59] and people get walk out on the water and
[1:59:01] he sees jesus he's got his eyes on jesus
[1:59:02] his faith is big it's strong
[1:59:04] and then all of a sudden the fear became
[1:59:06] to come on him and what did he do
[1:59:08] down down down
[1:59:14] listen what the prophet says here
[1:59:18] no matter how weak how sick
[1:59:21] how far in sin whatever the condition
[1:59:25] is he's there to make intercession upon
[1:59:28] what we confess
[1:59:29] that he has did for us and anything that
[1:59:31] was included in the atonement wounded
[1:59:33] for our transgressions bruised for our
[1:59:35] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:59:36] upon him
[1:59:37] by his stripes were healed any of those
[1:59:39] things those
[1:59:41] attributes of his death if we take it in
[1:59:44] our heart and believe it to be
[1:59:46] truth and confess it that it
[1:59:49] that he has done it before we
[1:59:52] ever feel anything about it he's god
[1:59:55] to make it right to make intercession
[1:59:59] listen here i read this and when i read
[2:00:02] it i thought i know he just didn't say
[2:00:03] that
[2:00:04] listen to this next statement
[2:00:07] he says if i was paralyzed
[2:00:10] has anybody ever heard him say this if i
[2:00:14] was paralyzed
[2:00:15] and in my heart i believe he healed me
[2:00:19] i'd confess that i was healed if i
[2:00:22] couldn't move a muscle
[2:00:23] and i believed it if i confess that i
[2:00:26] was healed
[2:00:27] then according if i mean from my heart
[2:00:31] not just mentally but from my heart
[2:00:36] before god he's making intercession upon
[2:00:38] my confession
[2:00:39] he has to bring it to pass
[2:00:50] why was jesus telling paris not to be
[2:00:52] afraid
[2:00:53] only believe only believe
[2:00:57] the lord tells us too not to be afraid
[2:00:59] not to panic
[2:01:00] because when we panic negative
[2:01:02] situations begin to take place
[2:01:04] the negativity begins to come in and
[2:01:07] jesus
[2:01:09] he didn't deny the reality of the
[2:01:10] situation
[2:01:13] this was a real situation jerry jerris
[2:01:15] was his daughter was real
[2:01:18] but like i said she was really dead and
[2:01:21] jesus knew this
[2:01:23] and jesus you know he didn't look at
[2:01:26] jairus and say you know what
[2:01:29] if that woman hadn't stopped me i bet
[2:01:31] we'd have made it on time
[2:01:36] it must not be the will of god that your
[2:01:39] daughter be healed
[2:01:41] or she wouldn't stop me
[2:01:44] isn't that the way people try to do your
[2:01:45] walk with god
[2:01:50] i'm praying about this and i'm praying
[2:01:51] that god will lead me and guide me
[2:01:53] through this and then all of a sudden
[2:01:54] you're trying to tell
[2:01:55] you're trying to you want people to
[2:01:58] build your faith and i say well
[2:02:00] it just wasn't the will of god
[2:02:04] just wasn't for you
[2:02:07] you want to be a christian but look at
[2:02:09] your backslide it's just just not the
[2:02:10] will of god
[2:02:11] you must not be that seed you must not
[2:02:13] be that one you must not be
[2:02:16] predestinated
[2:02:20] jesus didn't look at him and say you
[2:02:21] know if it would have been his will
[2:02:24] i'd have been on the scene but i'm sorry
[2:02:26] it's too late it's too late darius i
[2:02:27] can't do nothing there's nothing i can
[2:02:28] do about it
[2:02:31] you had a lovely little girl but now
[2:02:32] she's gone
[2:02:35] that's not what he said
[2:02:38] that's not what he did he went straight
[2:02:40] into jairus house as if nothing
[2:02:42] had happened he went straight in there
[2:02:44] with a kind of faith
[2:02:45] doesn't panic he went right in there
[2:02:47] with the kind of faith that holds on to
[2:02:49] what he had
[2:02:50] he goes in there with that kind of faith
[2:02:51] and he operates the way he always does
[2:02:53] and the way he always will
[2:02:55] because god knows the outcome jesus
[2:02:59] starts fulfilling
[2:03:00] his promises and when jesus starts
[2:03:02] fulfilling the promises in your life and
[2:03:03] answers prayer
[2:03:04] you're going to be in a different kind
[2:03:06] of place
[2:03:09] he doesn't care that the storm rises he
[2:03:12] doesn't care that there's a red sea and
[2:03:13] pharaoh's behind you
[2:03:14] he doesn't care that the raging sea in
[2:03:18] your life
[2:03:19] is scaring you to death god does not
[2:03:21] concern with that
[2:03:23] god concerns with what he can do and as
[2:03:25] far as he's concerned
[2:03:26] he's going to continue in the direction
[2:03:29] to get you there
[2:03:30] if you need a miracle in your life he's
[2:03:32] going to continue to push you in the
[2:03:33] direction to receive
[2:03:34] a miracle
[2:03:38] don't let go of your faith your faith is
[2:03:41] what holds you
[2:03:43] and jesus listen he surrounded himself
[2:03:45] with faith
[2:03:47] he took peter james and john
[2:03:50] and they come into the house of the the
[2:03:52] synagogue ruler
[2:03:55] and they see this commotion and people's
[2:03:57] crying and wailing all around them
[2:04:00] and they're crying she's dead she's dead
[2:04:02] the girl's dead
[2:04:04] and jesus looks at him and says she's
[2:04:05] not dead
[2:04:07] she's asleep and they laughed at him
[2:04:11] are you a crazy man she's dead because
[2:04:14] we've already embalmed her
[2:04:15] the prophet said they emballed within an
[2:04:17] hour or so an hour or two
[2:04:19] of a person dying so that they could get
[2:04:21] them in the grave so that the stench
[2:04:22] didn't take over
[2:04:22] she's dead we've been are you crazy no
[2:04:25] she's not dead
[2:04:26] she's just asleep
[2:04:32] and all this commotion and all this
[2:04:35] laughter
[2:04:36] and all this doubt he pushed on the
[2:04:39] outside
[2:04:41] of the room
[2:04:45] that's right what did he take it's just
[2:04:47] like in the holies of holies
[2:04:49] he took in faith into that interior room
[2:04:52] he took faith in there where jairus's
[2:04:54] daughter was laying there asleep
[2:04:56] he took peter john and the mama and
[2:04:58] daddy who else is going to pray greater
[2:05:00] for you than
[2:05:01] my daddy and jesus walked over to her
[2:05:04] and he begins to get over to her and he
[2:05:06] looks at her he takes her by the hand
[2:05:08] and he says
[2:05:08] talitha
[2:05:12] which means little girl i say unto you
[2:05:16] get up
[2:05:21] talitha kumar little get up because
[2:05:23] you're gonna live
[2:05:24] regardless of the doubters regardless of
[2:05:26] those laughing regardless of what others
[2:05:28] said
[2:05:28] i said you're asleep so rise up and what
[2:05:31] did she do she got up and walked
[2:05:32] she made a confession that god had moved
[2:05:35] on the scene because
[2:05:36] somebody called god
[2:05:48] mary and martha can i do one more
[2:05:52] mary and martha they send word to jesus
[2:05:55] come quickly and quickly our brother's
[2:05:57] sick
[2:05:58] our brother's sick we don't know how
[2:05:59] long he can make it
[2:06:03] well four days later
[2:06:06] four days later after the tomb was
[2:06:10] sealed
[2:06:10] four days later after the embalming
[2:06:12] process four days later
[2:06:14] after the grieving process has started
[2:06:16] here comes jesus onto the scene
[2:06:22] and martha looks at him and says lord if
[2:06:23] you had been here i know
[2:06:25] my brother would not have died i know in
[2:06:28] my heart he wouldn't have died
[2:06:30] but what did she say next but i know
[2:06:33] that even now god
[2:06:35] you will give whatever you're asked of
[2:06:39] so she begins to look at him and jesus
[2:06:41] says martha
[2:06:42] martha answers and said i know he'll
[2:06:44] rise again in a resurrection because
[2:06:46] jesus said he's going to rise
[2:06:47] and jesus says i am the resurrection do
[2:06:50] you believe in me
[2:06:51] if you believe in me as the resurrection
[2:06:53] he can resurrect right now
[2:06:55] so they go in there and they begin to
[2:06:56] tell everybody and as they're going to
[2:06:58] the tomb here comes mary now and she's
[2:07:00] crying and she's wailing
[2:07:02] saying why didn't come jesus we called
[2:07:04] you and called you and called you i know
[2:07:05] you heard
[2:07:07] and jesus and his heart hurt
[2:07:10] jesus begins to seek pain and the
[2:07:12] anguish that these ladies have went
[2:07:14] through
[2:07:15] lazarus was his friend and jesus begins
[2:07:18] to see that lazarus
[2:07:19] meant so much to these and he begins to
[2:07:24] weep
[2:07:30] he walks up to the tomb and says remove
[2:07:33] the stone
[2:07:36] we can't do it it's been four days
[2:07:41] jesus it's been four days his nose has
[2:07:42] sunk in the worms are eating his flesh
[2:07:45] he stinks we can't unlock undo the tomb
[2:07:50] undo the tomb and as they roll the stone
[2:07:53] away he moves into the scene and he says
[2:07:55] lazarus
[2:07:56] fourth and the prophet said if he hadn't
[2:07:59] said it every resurrected saint would
[2:08:01] have come up out of the ground
[2:08:02] that is the power of god on the scene
[2:08:04] god moving on the sea
[2:08:05] come forward lazarus brothers and
[2:08:07] sisters
[2:08:12] if he can resurrect a physical body
[2:08:15] he can resurrect a broken marriage if he
[2:08:18] can resurrect a physical body he can
[2:08:20] resurrect your finances
[2:08:22] he can resurrect anything that the world
[2:08:24] says is dead
[2:08:26] the world may say it's there but in
[2:08:27] reality that's not the finality of it
[2:08:32] the ultimate thing is that god is in
[2:08:34] control and god jesus may have another
[2:08:36] plan for your family
[2:08:38] god may need to put you into a place
[2:08:40] that you have to go witness to somebody
[2:08:42] god needs people that will get out in
[2:08:44] shoe leather and witness to the people
[2:08:46] of what god has done in their life
[2:08:52] you may be dead right now but when jesus
[2:08:54] is on the scene
[2:09:01] let me tell you something keep people
[2:09:02] with faith authority
[2:09:05] you keep the peter and john the james
[2:09:08] all those naysayers all those doubters
[2:09:11] they'll come to you
[2:09:13] like flies they'll come to you like
[2:09:16] flies on death why because that's their
[2:09:18] job is to discourage you
[2:09:20] to put you in a different direction
[2:09:21] surround yourself with faith
[2:09:23] surround yourself with god let's stand
[2:09:27] to our feet
[2:09:29] amen amen
[2:09:37] there's nothing impossible with the
[2:09:38] master of the wind
[2:09:46] you may get a little sidetracked in your
[2:09:47] journey
[2:09:53] things may not always seem like they
[2:09:55] want them to be
[2:09:56] you may not always think that things are
[2:09:58] going to work out to your benefit or to
[2:10:00] your goodness or to
[2:10:01] the way you want things to work but
[2:10:02] remember just to call god on the scene
[2:10:05] god takes the impossible and makes it
[2:10:08] possible
[2:10:09] god takes death and turns it into life
[2:10:12] god takes a
[2:10:12] an uncrossable sea and brings down a
[2:10:15] highway
[2:10:18] god's mindful of every one of his
[2:10:19] children is that you
[2:10:23] i don't know what you're going through
[2:10:26] but i know this was strong on my
[2:10:28] heart and i know it's been leading up to
[2:10:29] it for for a week and a half two weeks
[2:10:32] of words that's been said by our pastor
[2:10:34] in the past week songs that's been
[2:10:36] saying so i don't know what it is that
[2:10:38] somebody's needing today
[2:10:40] but i feel like there truly is somebody
[2:10:42] here this was for
[2:10:45] it was for me i feel like i need to know
[2:10:49] more about god and being able to place
[2:10:51] god on the scene
[2:10:53] being call him into a place to where
[2:10:57] he meets our need
[2:11:00] you know when we realize who we are you
[2:11:02] know what the prophet said we're an
[2:11:04] invincible army
[2:11:06] and that's a powerful statement
[2:11:10] i want god to be able to use me
[2:11:14] and depend upon me to be a witness for
[2:11:17] somebody in this life
[2:11:19] brothers and sisters i didn't have this
[2:11:21] on my notes and
[2:11:24] being a witness for some of our life
[2:11:26] this church ought to be full you know
[2:11:27] there's people are so
[2:11:28] lost in sin people are so
[2:11:32] wretched in the way they live they hate
[2:11:34] the way they live
[2:11:35] but they don't know what the answer is
[2:11:38] we have to be a witness to somebody we
[2:11:40] have to be able to answer
[2:11:42] to somebody
[2:11:49] god sure is good to us you know what

[2:12:49] side pharaoh behind them a sea all
[2:12:51] around them on the other side

[2:13:04] the belief in the hope and the
[2:13:05] deliverance that they have need of this
[2:13:07] morning
