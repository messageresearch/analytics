Psalms 112. page is still turned in there amen if you're there amen praise ye the Lord blessed is the man that feareth the Lord that delighteth greatly in his Commandments wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endureth forever [Applause] a good man showeth favor and lindeth he will guide his affairs with discretion he shall not be afraid of evil Titans his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord [Applause] he had dispersed he hath given to the poor his righteousness endureth forever his horns shall be exalted With Honor altogether the wicked shall see it and be grieved he shall gnash with his teeth and melt away the desire of the wicked Shall Perish amen foreign Lord bless you all this morning you know you read a Psalm like that you know run around talked many messages about worrying you read what God's word like that what do you have to worry about you know it doesn't take away from the fact that we're human you know we have emotions and sometimes we let our emotions get the best of us but when you read something like that why are you worried if you committed a completely into Christ's hands what is there really to work now again I have to you always have to quantitate stuff excuse my using big words but you really have to bring it down to the basics your enemy's goal in life is to make you worry about things you absolutely have no control over and when you and when you realize the sole goal is to get you to worry about the things that really don't matter what they do is they keep you away from the things that really do matter and I was uh reading that devotional this morning and uh I'm totally awful what I was going to say but if you return with me to Peter uh first Peter the fourth chapter in the devotional this morning I was reading the one I read every day the old one you know it talks about brother I wrote some bullets from it but yeah the scripture this morning for that devotional was the fourth chapter of First Peter and I'll read it's not a long chapter and like I said you can never read God's word too much if this is what Peter had to say but we know it wasn't Peter but we know it was the Lord speaking through Peter for us in this generation where we're at right now we have the very words that God spoke through Peter to us and it says for as much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourself likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered In the Flesh had ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his times in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God and that's the purpose of your enemy this morning you know I don't I don't even want to talk about it anymore you know I you know years ago I would talk about how it's only going to get worse and get worse while talking about it don't make a difference anymore it's already here so worrying about it ain't gonna change what's going on outside those four walls and when he goes on to say for times past for time past our life may suffice to have brought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness plus excess of wine reveling banqueting and abdominal idolatry so Pierce pointing us where we came from when they think if they strange that you run not with them to the same exact excess of Riot speaking evil love and so what Peter's telling us is what all the preachers tell you you know that they're going to speak evil of you no matter who you are so trying to fellowship with the world out there and the age that we're living in right now is not going to do you any good it's only going to make you worse it isn't going to make you better and worrying about the things they're doing is going to make you far worse so you know and simply believe in God's word is where we need to be it and then goes on to say hint say here we're in they think it's strange that you run that with them to the same excess Riot speaking evil love you who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead for this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to God in the spirit and I was this is the most important things at the end of this chapter but the end of all things is at hand and you be therefore sober I'll watch him onto prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover a multitude of sins you know the world gets worse basically we need to get better it's that we need to be the opposite of whatever the world is this morning you need to be the opposite as they get worse you need to get better in the age that we live in I mean it's pretty simple you know and it goes on to say but at the end of all things is a tambi you're therefore sober and watch on to prayer and above all things have further charity among yourselves for charity shall cover a multitude of sins you know that's the gospel and the Bible but the message of the hour hour that we all trust and believe it's just simple charity and being sober in the age that we is and goes on use Hospitality one to another without virgin and as every man hath received gifts even so ministered so the thing that strikes me brother brownham said the same thing and Peter's saying the same thing as God gives you more you should be giving out more it's not you storing everything up and not giving anything out so as God gives you more of himself you should be poor and more out to the people around you and he goes on that use Hospitality one to another without grudging as every man hath received the gift even so many of the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God I'll keep reading and I'll take a lot of time I was in that message you know it was talking about the story of the Hornets but I wrote some bullet things he was talking about he was saying if we as Believers as Christians he was talking about being more juvenile what he meant anybody changed and then a a comma later is being more childlike so as Christians we need to be more childlike and what that means is as a child is dependent on their father or mother for every good thing that that's given to him it's the same as us as Christians but if we can remain simple in childlike and just totally trust Jesus Christ for the things that we need you wouldn't have any worry this morning and the other thing he talks about it uh brother Brown talks about it but the world is the opposite it's Simplicity you know it's the simple things that God wants you to do you know read your Bible pray you know just simple things that are hard to do in these so there's so much trying to take over your time out there and the other thing he mentioned here the most important thing is and everyone stress stresses over this basically you just simply have to relax and just believe you just got to relax you just got to trust God and just believe that he's going to bring about the good circumstances that you need in your life and then and then all that produces one simple thing and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the promises of God and it's that Divine love he was talking about in that job or he had that Divine love not just feeling of love but he had Divine love for those Hornets that they were they would since he had that kind of love the Hornets just simply listened to him when he asked him to go back into their nest and then Fellowship all that brings about one thing in our lives and that's true Fellowship between you and Jesus between you and the spirit and he uh I just gonna read this I was thinking about that this morning uh and I'll finish with this I hope I turn to the right chapter yeah I turned to the right Java uh it's chapter you don't have to turn there it's chapter 40 in job and it and it kind of goes along with what I'm saying you can't add to yourself you can't take away from yourself whatever your statute is whether you're tall or small big or wide whatever it is it doesn't make a difference you are what God makes you to be and you can't change anything about yourself in the National sense because that's who God wants you to be but you can change who you are in a spiritual sense you can change yourself every day you don't have to remain that same old lack of power lack of Charity Christian you can allow God to change you and become better than you are this morning but um it's just uh reading yeah I think I lost my place here I think it was the 39th chapter of Joe Bob was reading but God is talking to job and letting him know that in in context we're just one seed in a grain in a garnery we're just one little seed in a whole sea of seeds we're just one little aspect of it and I'll just read what God had to say here in job in the 39th chapter I won't read the whole chapter I know I say that I wind up read 40 or 50 verses but I'll just read a few notes thou the time this is in the 39th first verse notice about the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth well cance thou Mark when the Heinz do calf so God's telling job here you don't have control over this I do you can't tell when this happens or that happened but I can and you go cancel that number the months that they fulfill or know thou the time when they bring forth they bow themselves they bring forth their young ones they cast out their sorrows their young ones are in good liking they grow up with corn they go forth and return not on to them so everything that God is talking about here is set in Aura by himself and it's no different in our own lives and in our things God sets things in order I'm just going to read a few more and who had sent out the young ones that are in good life and grow up with corn forth and return not unto them who have sent out the wild ass fewer who have loose the bands of the wild ass who whose house have I made the Wilderness and the baron land his dwellings to scorn us the multitudes of the city neither regardeth either crying of the driver I'm not going to read the whole chapter cutting a little short here this morning but he also later on in the chapter talks about the ostrich you know so he sets there's all different kinds of animals over there some would you think are better mothers other others you would think are less better modest but it's all in God's time it's all in God's planning and it's the same way for us this morning the only thing I would say is you see the world that we live in this morning you shouldn't worry about what the what the final result is if you have Christ as your savior this morning you know the world I was just thinking out there this morning as we go into another Christmas season or as the church is out there are going into another Advent season as they call which is nothing wrong with it but you know do you spend yourself more concerned about the first Advent where we should be actually more concerned about the second Advent or the Rapture of the church is where we really should be worried about this morning brother David loving with all your heart yes amen God is good isn't he yes he is let's stand this morning amen just appreciate the Lord this morning appreciate each and every one that's here this morning God he's just an awesome God he's been so good to us and I sing a little horse I Love You Lord and I left my

breathe in that little one or not but appreciate it what the Lord's done for brother Weston and just pray you keep his hand upon him and somebody's got to fly year round so I'd rather it be someone that I knew that trusted in God you know and I hear the prophet talk about he said about a doctor he said that's the one I want he said I want him to come work on me because he's got faith and he believes in God he said that's the one I want amen and you know somebody was talking and I said well I said you know they said they trusted God until the rains broke brother and said that's the time you start trusting him because you feel like you got control but you know in this day and time we just have to trust the Lord every day because we don't know what this day holds but we know who holds it amen God bless you buddy it's good to have you all with us this morning amen I always overlook him every time they come and it's good to have y'all this morning amen listen to that song on page 139

that used to come to church here and I won't mention any names and I was up early this morning and just praying on my heart and just praying that God would move and I thought you know Lord they're in situations it's not really good but that's where you brought me from this morning amen you know if he can save me he can draw them back in and you know I I'm just so thankful that God doesn't look at how much money we got or who we are but he looks at that we're a child of the king this morning amen I'm just so thankful for that this morning amen I've Anchored In Jesus this morning page 157 amen

and Greece my peers [Music] just did that grease appears [Music] thank you good morning everyone God bless you it's good to be a Christian Good to Be Alive how many is alive this morning how many is alive in Christ this morning thanks be to God appreciate you and open your bibles if you would I'll get right to the word I'll just I'll spend any time saying hello from everybody to everybody but hello and God bless you and good to be a part of the body of Christ and the family of God and so good to be part of what God is doing in this hour we are his action we are his work the Bible said we're his workmanship created we are his new creation today amen thank you for standing and honoring the word now in the book of Colossians I want to read beginning verse 25 I would have to say hello from the Saints back home and from my life and even from Joel he said say hi to any of his old friends up here and uh and uh we thank God for each and every one of you 25 of Colossians 1. we're up I made a minister according to the dispensation and dispensation means an economy so God opened up an economy for the people through the prophet or the in this case the church-aged messenger Apostle Paul and God opened up an economy for us through brother Brown through the message of the hour so we have a we have a different economy than the world's got we got promises that they don't have aren't you glad for that and so we got to make ourselves a Avail to those things if otherwise if we don't go to the store just like if I wanted to buy some good old Amish stuff I'd have to go over to where is it Scottsville and go over to the Amish store over there and go in and get it it's available but you got to go get it amen so we're here today to get what God has made available to us today amen and then you know the word sin means you miss the mark Or you miss what God was offering to you that at that time so I don't want to be a sinner I don't want to be a sinner I want to get what God has for me today amen and uh so we read here wherever my May to minister according to the dispensation or the economy of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hid from ages and generations but now has made manifest to his Saints it's the mystery that's been hid from ages and generations made manifest to you then then you're one of his Saints it's only made manifest to the Saints so when you look at yourself the kind of life but if he's made the mystery known to you you're one of his Saints the the revelation of the mystery is going to make you a saint amen we don't change ourselves I love what Brother David said he changes us aren't you glad for that and uh we appreciate the Lord and so this mystery that God was going to make known is this in verse 27. that God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is say it with me Christ in you the hope of glory shall we bow our heads and have a word of prayer Heavenly Father we love and appreciate you it's such a joy be back here amongst friends and loved ones thank you for brother Byler and sister Byler and all the Byler family thank you for Caleb my friend who's always gives me a little room up there in the house and and uh shares his lovely loving animals with me and we appreciate that pure love that that these creatures of God have but we as people on the other hand have a little trouble uh showing pure love so we just ask you to help us have the pure love in our heart today Father and we love you with all our heart like Brother David said in the song serve his brother was sharing it's just everything that happens just makes us love him more and we love you and if we love you then we have to love each other because book said if we say we love God but can't love our brother then rely we're telling a lie oh Lord don't let us live lie let us live the truth in all honesty father we ask you for thy Glory bless your people today uh take hold of my uh lips and the gift that you put in me and uh steer it just the right direction that will help someone here today Father and we commit our life to you in Jesus name amen God bless you take your seats make yourself comfortable we won't be here long I'll just get this over and we'll have a good time uh I'm I'm learning you know I guess you know I look closer you get towards your body change and the other dimension you realize you don't have to preach it all over here uh we'll be talking about the Lord forever and forever and forever so uh you know I used to I guess with that Evangelistic call on my life I would just give both barrels 100 and tell them everything I know because I never thought I never knew if I'd be able to come back again but here I've been invited time after time and I appreciate brother Byler doing that so uh we'll uh we'll be uh we'll be merciful and gracious to you today how about that but on the other hand I'll say exactly what God put on my heart and if it if it burns a little or hurts a little it's got to uh you know if it doesn't make you sick sometime it'll it won't get you any better so uh God has to shock us sometimes even in a new birth you know you have to sometimes you have to sometimes those weren't Lively I'm telling you but other times you've got to get a little spank so uh God does you know a lot of the things we've gone through in this last year and I think maybe you have also has been God given us a little spank maybe to shock us to take a deep breath and realize we are alive in Christ and that every promise in the book belongs to us amen and we thank God for that and so we do appreciate him so I want to talk about uh the power of high expectation and we realize uh uh having said that that they're the other side of that and we want to kind of think on that line too that the sin of low expectation you know a lot of times we don't think well we know we're living clean we're not out here doing sin and stuff like that but brother bear said sin is unbelief and unbelief will cause us to have very low expectations of what God's promised us and I look around I see people with low expectations I see families I see uh married people do you ever notice that when you first get married you got high expectations I mean way up there like your marriage is going to be the best ever was this is the finest woman in there in the world or finest man in the world and then after uh how long does it take to start getting disappointed uh after a few disappointments you you lower your expectations based on your perceived reality but yet if the dream could continue living in your heart you see then you would based on your high expectation you would have to fulfill what the prophet said you get what you expect you expect to see somebody fail exactly if you expect to see yourself fail exactly that's what's going to happen amen and so um you said say you say expect to see something to criticize even in his meeting can you imagine could you how many of how many would think that you could possibly go to hear Brother Brown and preach in a live meeting and he'd be there in preaching the prophet our prophet and you'll be disappointed because but some people go there with their mind made up of what they're going to get and what how God's going to do it and he doesn't do it that way and they get disappointed because they expected that maybe it would happen that way but when you expect that God's going to give you everything you need uh you can you can be sure or you're going to get what you expect but your expectation actually brings it from that other dimension into where you live right now there's one thing to have the cure for disease it's another thing you need to access it a lot of it you a lot of times you go down to get something from the drugstore or something like that and the boys say I just need to get this medicine I've got enough prescription but once we go there in the drug stores close but you go down there and you can't get it but see God has made it available to us this morning because God knew we'd be here God knows exactly everything that's going on I believe that morning by morning his mercies are renewed to us his promises confirmed to us time and time again it's like God confirmed the Covenant with Abraham he's confirmed it with Jesus Christ he confronted it with Brother by Adam he's confirming his promise to you day by day amen morning by morning it's brand new life it's a brand new day it's a brand new opportunity and so here we are living in the past under disappointments and hurts and having low expectations and it's a sin to be like that for a Christian I don't want to say I'm a Christian and have low expectations because that's the proof that I'm really not what I'm saying amen so I think I've made that point did I hammer that one in good low expectations is sin so we want to flip that over and find out just what our expectations should be and how that God wants us to have high expectations what he what he demands of us amen what he expects of us because he's expecting Also let's read that in a scripture in the book of uh Hebrews I want to read this in Hebrews chapter oh Where'd I put my Bible marker well I think I took it out of there no problem I won't spend all morning looking for it but it said that Jesus has ascended up on high henceforth he's already beat the devil down he's already paid the one price that was the only price that could bring us back to our sonship amen because we're more than just human there will never be angels we are actually God beings put in a human flesh because we have eternal life eternal life never be down never ends it's God's own life Zoe life and that life is in you now amen Hallelujah so we're not a We're Not a Human Being having a Divine experience we're a Heavenly being having a human experience is just a time here after we go through this we go back where we came from praise the name of the Lord and uh I'm looking forward to that aren't you but I'm not only looking forward to it like it's going to be way off I'm looking for it like it's right here today everything God needs to do for me today he can do and will do if I expect it to happen amen so we do thank the Lord appreciate God's uh goodness and mercy oh I got so many scriptures we could read on this but I want to take us to Genesis 1 1 and just read this you don't need to turn because you probably know this one by heart in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light now I did something overnight I just came back from India and I did something over there I said I told the people it was a 500 people gathered in this building came back about two weeks ago about a week ago or something from India had a wonderful time it's uh you know it's amazing that when you when I was young and just looking forward to you know what God might and then I hear I look back on all these trips overseas and and everyone that I ever went on was the best wine so this one was the best one ever even though back in August I went to Africa and that was the best one ever so it just keeps getting better because that's what I'm expecting I'm needed to get better we need to be better amen we need to have the realization of what God is amen and uh God we don't we can't be expecting God to change but we're expecting God to change us so everything that happens is part of that great plan aren't your plan for that amen like God told Jeremiah he said I'm going to hasten to perform my word you know when you look that up it means I am going to stay alert I am going to keep watch over you it means I will not let my promise fall and God's high expectations keeps him drawing from you that which he's put in you aren't you glad for that anything everything that's in the tree is already in there everything's in seed form already inside you how many believe that you were an elect seed before you even had a clue about what was going on God had placed something in you that was going to transform you into a supernatural being and yet you're still human you can worry you can cry you can suffer you can hurt you can feel disappointed but at the same time you got God's nature in you that is pushing out high expectations see when God spoke the word and he said let there be light now brother Brown describes it like this he said he pointed his finger and said there was a little light that just sprung into me and he said it flew out there for millions of years and he said then he pointed and said stop and that light stopped and said God had spoken the word and God had believed his own word and God had expected his word to happen just like he said it and watch it might have been millions of years he said but he said God kept his expectation level high all the time now I'm not talking mind over matter and I'm not you know one of these motivational speakers but I'm talking about the nature of God in you is what projects your faith and your expectation you could not ever do it but because of who is in you dude it's like we look at ourselves in America and say how could I ever be the bride of Christ how could I be ever identified with a man to the caliber of brother Branham or even the some of you all here how can I be identifier called your brother or even be to the capacity to what I would be preaching and you'd be listening to me how could I ever do that I can't do it but he that commissioned us is doing it already Amen Let me thank God for that and that's why that's why we don't worry because worry don't have no virtue I was so good bro that was a confirmation to me brother Brian God bless you all I love you all so much and my time is so short to tell you so I'll just show you by preaching the law a long sermon in a short time I'll show you that I love you I got a year of sermons I want to tell you about I just got it on my heart to express those so many things and the Lord help me to mind the clock back there amen and uh praise the name of the Lord good thing my eyes are failing they must be because I went out the other day isn't amazing I went out in the woods and I've heard about you know the deer's populations down and must pull dying off or something like that and I heard of things because of the drought listen drought we live with drought in Arizona drought is just normal rain is what's special but out here for you to have a drought nah I know it was rough and it is still rough still rough steel rough we need not just the little Dew drops of Mercy that are falling here we need we need showers a blessing I'm going to expect God's going to send it to you and I know brother Stephen he called me said brother Pray For Rain is so dry our ponds are drying up and everything else and I I prayed for rain the next day he called that praise the Lord it rained but it only rained for three hours so he said Pray Again I said with that kind of expectation something's going to happen when you call like people would go to brother Adams you know for an interview or something and they believed that when they got there something was going to happen and brother Brown said that's the reason they got what they came for the same thing with our everyday life and our coming to church when we pray like our sister saying sister who sing that song that was so beautiful God bless you amen I I clapped in the back everyone else clapses that was so sweet and through you know I can't we can pray but she prayed prayer without expecting uh it it isn't the same because you do praise because you're expecting God to do something amen and we appreciate the Lord so even God's Own nature which when you're born again it isn't always shouting and jumping and running and feeling good and you know everything's fine and you know no it's not you at all it's God's Own nature that has come into you and he if yeah I hope you can agree with me on this God doesn't never lower his expectations God keeps them way up there amen and so if you're like him which is child of God should be in His image you know we were made in His image like Adam was expectations should be way up here amen and so today that's if I could leave you with that thought expect the miraculous like we read in the scripture he Christ in you is the mystery the mystery is Christ in you but how many knows that the Bible talks about in the last days the the so-called Christians would be just have the form of godliness but you know I know when God talked about in in in Timothy when he talked about God made flesh in a human being which by the way was divinely born Jesus but he's also born in you God made flesh in you is the mystery of godliness and the church out here is the form of God in this and they're both reading the same Bible they're both praying to the same God both talking to the same God but one is a form of godliness because it's not inspired them the whole church is based and built on Revelation you can just memorize it and you can quote it and you can say it you can try to do it and how many here I've tried and failed and got disappointed and then your expectations go down down down down down down I believe my job as a preacher your job as a Christian as a parent is to build people's expectations not to push them down they already down they've already got low expectation and I believe God sent brother Branham build our expectations Way High and God said brother Thomas to do that for us too no to see but we can't just look at the person because the person is going to disappoint us there is no person here that will not disappoint now I don't expect to disappoint you but I probably will come find out recently there's a lot of people I disappointed never even knew it they were so disappointed they they were ashamed to talk to me about it you can be so disappointed or ashamed to pray you lower your expectation well God don't want to hear me God does want to hear you he said it already in his word God expects to hear from you like a sister saying good I can't I can pray I can not only can pray I must pray I must pray because I have to have something in me that can connect with God and the only thing that could connect to God is God God and God connect them brother man said you got two omnipotents that are meeting here like Martha as a grave of Lazarus when Jesus came in it was one omnipotent was almighty God in Jesus Christ the other omnipotent brother Adam said what that faith and that expectation that was in Martha's heart when two omnipotents met something happened praise the name of the Lord how many can call you and said I'm that something today time that's something that's happening today God's omnipotent promise and my omnipotent high expectations makes it happen in my life today even if I don't see it even if I don't feel it even if nobody else sees it I'm a mystery of godliness I'm not a form of God and is trying to pretend trying to put on and show the church that I'm spiritual I'm a mystery of godliness amen God hiding himself in that little room that little tent down on the inside that third pull that is the opening of the word of God to you as an individual amen so God's going to watch over his word and a lot of times Satan is coming to come around all the time and say God don't care about you because look it's not happening well what do you expect an unbeliever to say he ain't seeing nothing he ain't feeling nothing amen well I'll tell you one of these days You're Gonna feel about foot on top of his head he's going to feel your foot because the Bible said you expect this to happen that shortly the God of Peace is going to brew Satan under your feet amen hallelujah but the devil's so hard-headed he never learned he can get beat up he doesn't even know how it happened or why amen but me and you we can be get beat up we can be put down we can be hurt but then we have a reason why God is putting us through things getting us the place to where we won't sin anymore and as I said at the beginning sin is having low expectations of God's promise for us how many members you have first converted brother you thought everywhere you have Miracles where you did birds were saying indifferent everything was great everybody loved you you loved everybody and you come to find out two days later I wonder if anybody loves me but blessed be the name of the Lord that nature doesn't quit having high expectations so it was easy to change people Jesus wouldn't have had to go to Calvary it ain't easy to change people especially people in your life our own children grandchildren our own loved ones even spouses you can't change them but keep your expectations up high in God and God can do what you can never do amen is that is that too simple you are but David I think was talking about Simplicity and I think brother Brian too I think brother Thomas mentioned it back there so you wouldn't expect me to be complicated today then would you amen you would expect me to get on with my sermon though and get it over right so God bless you amen so God is staying alert he's keeping watch over and he's not going to let his promise fall amen uh and his high expectations stayed High until the promise materialized and that's the same way in our life this Rapture promise we'll materialize in US brother bam said as we feed on the word write that word that you feed on how does that body change happen he said that body forms around that word that you have become inside of you amen blessed be the name of the Lord so I want to become the word I skipped this little thought and I was talking about thinking about these deer I got on that and I got off of it but looking around I said boy how do they do it every deer I saw was healthy and happy until he met me then the Lord blessed us with venison again I thought you know here coming out here I'm just something you know it wasn't going to be good and even Brother Brad thank God he was so he was so expecting me to see that that nice doe that lord gave me us while I was praying for I was expecting it and then it just you know didn't work out it was over at both Austin's and it was just little guys and little gals and it wasn't it wasn't the one I was looking for for me I'm a meat Hunter I'm not coming here and shoot the horns that you want you get the horns I'd never found a way to boil them to get them soft enough to eat I like the food you can have them but then on the other hand I got to have a disclaimer on that I don't know if I could hold myself back if I saw the monster okay so careful if you put me on your farm I'll try to have integrity I think I did the other day and I waited Brother Brad I called him just Beth just for dark he said brother tell you just be patient that's sitting there nothing happening squirrels were all around I think they got a nest above that thing that little Hut there and a below it and everywhere else and uh I see in the old days I would just jumped out and try to run around the woods and probably spooked everything in the country and brother Urban remember those days don't let by the cat around the hunting Woods because everything's going to run but this time he just said be patient it'll happen oh I love that that's encouraging too you know and you know somebody has expectation when yours have lowered down and and sure enough just around five minutes till five no one knowing not knowing brother Caleb I knew he was over it right here back behind the woods you grow some healthy deer over here I'm telling you what you're not only that you got some helpful people there are some healthy Christians here amen so if you'd like to clap your hands you could do it too I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm one of them I got high expectations even being better gonna make it through the drought it's not going to hurt us they're they're fat that there yes it was so fat I shot by the grace of God not telling nothing stories and pulpit at the I think it was within five minutes that brother Caleb got the got his right over here and they were exactly almost his we're just a little bit longer a little bit bigger a little bit better but my expectations was met God will give you what you expect and then he gave me the strength getting old as I am which you may not have noticed and you probably haven't but yet I can't walk around like I used to do so I'm thinking how am I going to do this and then it worked out to where your camera came up with his truck and helped get it out of there brother Brad I didn't know how I was going to do it I didn't know how I was going to do it by the grace of God we did it so you know just put things in God's hand just expect that he's going to be there when when nothing is working out praise the Lord anyway brother praise the Lord anyway because God hasn't stopped being God God hasn't stopped watching over his word God hasn't stopped protecting you God hasn't stopped Sheltering you he's always there and he just wants to test you by letting your feelings run Rampage sometimes just see what's really the real part of you is it the feeling or is it that something that little something that God has done inside of you like brother man when he was tested in the final test you know and he said Satan came down said I don't love you remember when his lost is it lost his uh a child now his wife and Satan came down said how can you serve a dog like that he don't even love you here I've seen you pray I've watched you pray I've watched you Satan watches us when we pray I have watched your sacrifice I've watched you I don't know how Satan gets in our private chamber but he can see when you're dedicating consecrating when you're talking to God and he'll pull that on you he'll come back and say I heard you say that to God and God look at he don't love you remember brother Brandon said he said that was my hardest test that was my lowest hour my lowest hour and he said he couldn't now Satan couldn't get me on the reason to God because I knew there was a god I'd experienced his reality but he got me on he don't love you brother bam said he had this thought coming up in his mind didn't he and his thought was coming up in him you watch how God watches over his children brother you can have something creating a wrong thought in your mind and brother Brandon was taking then he don't love me then if he don't love me notice before you say it with your mouth you've got to think in your mind and he thought it in his mind if you're going to be that way I won't serve you he was going to say that to God now listen our Prophet wasn't uh Angel friends he was a human being but he had the nature of God and he expected that God was going to help him an hour of need amen and he's that thought from his brain to his mouth how long would that take traveling at the speed of light or a speed of nerves in the body just like that from his brain to his mouth something else was there down in his heart that interrupted what was going on in his brain couldn't get to his heart God cut off God cut off the unbelief cut off the low expectation cut it off and God pushed them expectations way up there and said though God slay me like job did you know I'll trust you I serve a God Like That I serve a God that can bring me from the deepest low I've ever been in to the highest high that I've ever had by bringing raising my expectations and I find out that when I have high expectations the people around me is kind of getting rubbed off on them you want that you want that anointing that you have to be rubbing off on other people but not that down part not that complaining part that's why when you're around somebody complaining listen nobody no Christian likes to be around a complainer because they're creating that kind of an atmosphere negativity and this and that because maybe sure they're way down there but their expectations being low proves that that's sin and if you take part in all the complaining you can but if you're living High here and high expectations they can be complaining all around you and it doesn't touch you because you're on a walk with God and you're lifted up in Heavenly places in Christ that's where we belong that's what God wants for us amen Church [Music] I don't want to bring you quantity I want to bring you quality so if you've got if you've got the quality you needed Let's uh you know let's start shutting down all shut down too but if you keep pulling you're still looking for the quality you need a that's what I'm gonna bring you but it ain't going to be quantity today promise don't have no high expectations of a long sermon because I was cleared in the back room in the office make sure that that was a a throat loss injure not a button in my mouth and I'm good I've been feared I got my clearance the Lord so thank me to God but it's just you get so much in your heart you want to bring it all I don't have to bring it all out to you because I ain't saying anything new I'm saying oh what the prophet said to us in this hour yeah that's what I love to see is people that stay with the message and have high expectations that God is big enough to make it happen in your life amen amen good yeah so never lowered his expectation you won't find one disclaimer in the Bible where God gives a disclaimer said in case it doesn't work out uh you know I won't be held liable God never put an old disclaimer in his word he just said there it is come and get it they didn't have to put a disclaimer because when you got high expectations your faith is there it's gonna happen amen blessed be the name of the Lord so I love this quote the scripture that we read Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you the hope of glory and that really means the expectation of the miraculous when you're a Christian you wake up every morning with that hope of glory that expectation of the supernatural God the miraculous the inspiration you know some people are looking for inspiration so hard looking for Revelation so hard when God comes down in Simplicity they miss it because they've lowered their expectation I've preached to people like that pretty well on a regular basis some one or two do I walk away from her no I'll come right back come right back waiting for that quality moment when they're lifted out of that see God's came down brother God's whole purpose from the beginning was to come down to our level amen God to come down to our level because we couldn't get up where he is so he had to come down and friends we gotta have him come down this morning we got to have him and he will because he's placed something in you that's part of him aren't you glad for that and he has high expectations and brother Ben said this way about the eagle you know the eagle is a special bird how many Eagles here today amen and because we know that the the the analogy there between the eagle and we're an eagle age and the message of the hour and he said oh he Likens his church to an eagle he said you are a city that sat on a hill not you're not in a valley you're a city that's set on a hill you can be seen as far off a lighted candle the church setting high with high expectations High ambitions Redman said I haven't got much hope for a pastor's church that hasn't got Ambitions to better themselves day by day year by year a church that's really a Church of the Living God will never stop and say well uh just come in I guess it's all right now that ain't the Church of God he's got an ambition to press on well I've done my part I've brought one Center this year and he got saved brother his brother Branham here brother that's not the ambition of the Church of God brother he said well you brought one you want to bring another and another and another and another we want to have high ambition and high expectation God wants us to be that way amen quoting the prophet amen you know Brother Band expectation he said in 61. it's usually expectation it's based upon a faith [Music] somebody gives you a promise say like I had a high expectation my brother invited me said he was going to come and get me and take me out tell you what my expectations were super and the it was exactly like it was amen so we went over to a good place and I've been wanting one of those ribeye steak and I don't eat it very often because I'm a venison man but I suffer through the dry heat to get a good rib eye steak once in a while and but I don't eat them too often because they uh they're not really good for your longevity but I ain't challenging you on that I ain't challenging you I'm just saying what I heard but brother Brown said if you're gonna eat one eat one prayer and he told Donnie think of me and rare steak so I like it just as red as it can get they just tastes better I found that out with venison duper Thomas if you don't cook it well done you leave it all pink in the middle it is much more delicious and I think it's that way that God wants to see the blood all the time in us we can have some delicious Fellowship delightful times when we're showing the red amen into his presence because it was the red that redeemed us amen I knew it was the blood praise the name of the Lord grateful to God anyway some of those may be my personal opinions and that's all but the other part of it is at my high expectations was met and praise the Lord for that and God will honor at high expectation and low expectations means there's sin around somewhere so you get that part so Broadband said the major sin of the Bride in the last days would be worldliness and the whole world out there has got low expectations they got to where they just don't care anymore they're so hard they could like that woman that rubber bands that girl who rejected the holy spirit in the meeting brother said it's your last call sister and you embarrassed her she ran out of the meeting said since that time brother Benny met her on the street drunk that's flask will be skinny room it and just gone so since that time brother ma'am that was God dealing with me and I refused it and since since that time I have got so hard careless I could see my mother you know Brian hell and laugh I think that's the way the world has got they have Lowered Expectations so much that the greatest reason in the world brother Bandy put him all over YouTube brother branham's on YouTube all the time everywhere all the great features the of the message out there and people just passing by because their expectations is so low but once in a while once in a while somebody will tune into something of spark on the inside have you got that little spark on the inside that just brings you to the word you know if you have the nature of God and you it always brings you to where God is and what God's doing amen and God Is Lifting our expectations through the miraculous Christ in you the expectation of the miraculous and the beautiful that's what that means Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you the expectation of the miraculous and the Beautiful so I look in the mirror and I don't see beautiful I see more ugly all the time a memo of it too uh realizing that wall you know by brother Ted Mr Smyrna they're getting so old we don't want to be around them anymore but thank God for people that aren't like that they got high expectations they don't look at me as old they look at me as and close to the body change amen we're not getting weaker we're getting better God's doing listen God's people say brother and Ted how can you do it because God got a high expectation that maybe this next year I might go five times overseas again because pandemics over thank God and I might go five says how can you do that why you just because one soul is worth 10 million worlds to me and if I can spark something by something I do or say and a lot of times it's not something I even say we had a family in India they came to me they drove 200 miles to come and tell me thank you and they brought their little girl she was seven years old she said seven years ago she was in the mother's womb and went to the doctor and the doctor said you got down syndrome child here this child is not you should abort this child and they said well what do we do what do we do now and and it was a little girl baby and they listen somebody said see I heard there's a meeting episode showing this brother from America is going to be there and there's just something they said sparked in their heart and they said we got to go there and I listen to most people I'm just nobody right maybe you can feel the same some most people don't realize who you are but sometimes somebody realizes there's something inside of you that can change people's life amen and that's where you gotta go whether you feel alive or don't feel like you still got to go because you got high expectations amen and uh and so I I went and we prayed for that mother I remember that very well two years later I went over there and they showed me the baby was born I thought one-year-old two-year-old baby and I blessed that little child her dedicated that little child then they come back they drove all the way they'll never forget this the rest of their life they drove all the way back said this was what they wanted us to abort this beautiful girl name is hope she's just a living doll seven years old and she just up against me like this like my own grandchild and I blessed her and had the time of our life and that family went away with tears in their eyes saying oh my we expected it and we got it amen so you can't make that lie you can't say well I expected it and I didn't get it you your expectations wasn't right God doesn't fail we fail we got to look at the Unseen not of what we see but what we believe amen right so look at it look at how it happened in heaven even can you imagine being in heaven and losing your expectations Lucifer in heaven lost his expectations he didn't think it was ever going to change he was always going to be a servant he wanted to be one of the upper echelon he wanted people to worship him he wanted angels to worship him he wanted to get some notoriety after all he was the most beautiful after all God had made him special but you know what makes us special we're able to admit that we're nothing that's what a real believer has this special he on the other hand lowered his expectations that God was ever going to give him a better position although he had the best position available right second in command brother bam said he was almost co-equal Satan was almost co-equal with God and he it still wasn't according to what he wanted he lowered his expectations that anything could get better and he got to thinking you know what we need a change around here said we need to get something a little more exciting a little daring a little naughty going on here and and then we can have a better way of life here and having that he lowered his expectations in God and now God felt that look God feels it when you lower your expectations do you think he does God can sense it God's got a machine better than whatever the doctors have he can read your spirit God discerns your heart he sees when you have dropped your expectations when your faith brother Adam could look out and see it like a light said man expectations were all up the roof your faith is high then he could also see it when a dark shadow come over when a dark shadow come on and you lowered your expectations my brother God's purpose in our being here this morning is to challenge us not to be sinning by having low expectations though God bless your heart Satan lowered his expectations and then he went into the garden and he lowered Eve's expectations Eve's expectations was Adam's going to tell me Adam's going to speak the word I'm going to have the child she might want to be a mother like any woman she wanted to be a mother God had already said she would be she wanted to have that child and Satan came along and said ah it's not going to happen the way you think Adam just Adam ain't gonna do it Adam he's way off somewhere else Adam should be here with you if he had been there that devil wouldn't he'd have had his legs cut off right there he'd have gone on his belly amen he should have done that when that devil came talking but she lowered it she got her to sympathize with his idea don't trust you Adam Adam Adam ain't going to do this for you right he lowers expectation how many marriages probably right even in a church like this have you seen you know break up and because of expectations lower and Satan come Whispering that that poisoned breath of the serpent where spring said nah they'll never change now they'll never change no they'll never change and you lower your expectations and you don't create anything around them anymore that could help them yeah and then you become dysfunctional we're all Masters Believers we believe we're all part of the Bride but we could be we could be very dysfunctional I want to be a functioning part don't you know there's times in my life I've been dysfunctional but I tell you what I needed somebody to come and create expectation in my life not just positive mind over matter you know motivational all the little nice little phrases I needed an atmosphere is that what we crave remember long for an atmosphere when he comes everything gets better when Jesus came amen blessed be the name of the Lord so we find out even she quit waiting for Adam and she lowered her expectations and went with the devil's plan got the Devil's Child that wasn't God's child that lets serpents seed that was the Devil's Child that he put in her for having low expectations I don't carry the Devil's Child around even though I'm in the message quote quotes and stuff but if I'm carrying Doom Gloom fear doubt Darkness impossible hopelessness that's the Devil's Child you see it in the message all the time oh you got to come here here's the Messiah here's the Messiah here's listen you don't have to move across the world to India or Africa where it got away they got these new brother branhams over there who believe that they got they got a quote brother Brandon said God takes his man never takes his spirit so here they were one day and William bam came and took over their body and now they're the new William Bannon and one of them's got ten thousand people following him and the other one has got 20. because people they build up their High expertise on the wrong place high expectations on the wrong place is as good as having no expectations at all you put your faith where it belongs on God's promise not on a man's ability lift up some man he'll always if he's a man of God God will make him thaw God will make him fall so he'll repent God will put it down because that's not his Messiah that's not his answer his is the word Christ in you the hope of glory the bride's Revival is not in a town not in a state not in a place the bride's Revival is you you are the bride's Revival that's what God expects God expects you to be the bride's Revival see what brother Ted how can I snap out of it you've got to do that yourself I can't do that for you but if I can say something that makes you Ponder about doing what our sister said praying about it and doing what Brother David does every Sunday and brother Thomas does in spite of what's going on in their life you wouldn't think anything was wrong when he comes up to lead song because he's in another Channel he's in that high expectation amen blessed in the name of the Lord we find that when when these are told by the man to get the people to believe not get them to Hope get them to know get them some knowledge get them to believe but if they believe they were level will rise so high it'll Force the promise into manifestation how many believe God for that you know it's farmer knows if he can get that seed in at the right time of year and the weather permitting and the sun will shine the length of days and the moisture content will be just right he knows that seed is certified seed he knows that that's going to grow amen it's going to sprout and grow blessed be the name of the Lord if God put something in these deer that should have been all scrawny this year but this is one of the I can't believe it they're just so healthy looking and I don't know if I asked somebody I said did half of them die because they're not that many rounds I don't know but the ones that I saw they made it brother in spite of the doubt is that okay using this analogy As the deer pants for The Living Water of the brook they found water somewhere say well I had no water every deer gonna die we ain't gonna have any good hunting this year but I came over here expecting but then my expectations went low but Brother Bear I knew because they've seen 19 the day or two before thank you but I'm giving away all the secrets my secret my secret honey hole Heidi Heidi Place of the deer I've gave it away but no you don't know exactly where it is and now I'm going to tell you but he will because he wants to help build up other people's expectations God's good to us when you have something positive powerful and wonderful miraculous beautiful in you which is Christ he's an expectation of that same power Wonder might Beauty rubbing off on someone else so you know that's why Satan wants to get you so down and say I ain't going to church I ain't going to that dinner they all want to get together and dinner and I know they all were going to gossip and all that and I ain't going to go what are you trying to do keep your keep all your miraculous to yourself give all your beauty to yourself or is it you're feeling so guilty because you're so ugly oh in expectations [Music] so God has to supernaturally come down doesn't he and Inspire his word to you do you know there's four Bibles in the beginning was the word and the words with God and the Word was God and that word is logos right the logos and that was Jesus but that word logos actually means the plan thank you God has a plan don't worry his plan will not be foiled Satan will not stop his plan amen but ambassadors four Bibles God wrote he made it clear to mankind he put one in the Stars do you ever study the Zodiac mother Brian and teach on that and I know like brother Morris hunger and he really taught on that a lot I think he's gone to the Lord is he brother Morris hungry and I think he went to the Lord a few years ago from down Tennessee Memphis yeah you ever hear him saying I just heard brother Brown say he'd love to hear Brother Morris I'm going during the seals he's saying down from his glory but he studied on the stars and it was just for me it was too much because if I got into that I'd be a longer preacher than I ever thought I could because you could go on and on and on and on forever so I just never went that way but I the thought of it is amazing that God wrote his Bible in the Stars and then he wrote another Bible that's that is the pyramid and the pyramid God hit all these mystery Secrets all these mysteries of what was going to eventually unfold to this moment and then he hid all that in there and and that was in the pyramid oh the king's chamber and the Queen's chamber and the distance and the measure of the years of time between Moses and David and David and Christ is all the pyramid God doesn't miss anything because you know people can actually delve into the study of the Stars delve into the study of the pyramid and miss the message of the hour because God brought it down so simple now the next Bible was in John 1. and the Word was made flesh and First Timothy 3 16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest in the flesh you say oh that was Jesus that is me that is you Jesus came to release you is that true the third Bible is the pyramid the fourth Bible the word made flesh oh I'm so glad that I'm not just a trying to work up my own enthusiasm and Revival my own energy I have people all the time brother Ted retire you pre you pre you went over 85 times overseas I said that ain't enough I got to go another 85. so I've gone two since then so I'm up at 87 across across the ocean say are you bragging no oh I'm bragging on him because he put inside of me a high expectation that I might win that last soul how do you know you won't be the one that wins that last search arms nobody listen to me nobody want to hear me come on somebody's needy somebody is waiting for you to cross their pathway but Madam said when you have the token like mother earth I know you like this quote when you have the when you have the talking in your life you create an atmosphere around you you make people not all the people maybe not even most of the people maybe not even some of the people but maybe just one person you make them hunger to have you talk to them give them a word give them something that'll raise their expectations out of from beneath the floor and lift them up on high where God wants us to live amen you say brother Ted you've you've really had one of them motivational speakers that's what you are you say anything you want about me what it is that's made me what I am it's almighty God he's built my expectation I expect that when I preach when I'm invited to preach I expect God moved on brother Thomas to invite me I didn't push my way in here good night brother Thomas And just because you feel sorry for me that's what the devil says all over the Thomas just feel sorry for the old man what what kind of voice to tell me God would never call me the old man he said my son like he did to job my son and his devil said ah you're so called son you pamper him you baby him you give him everything all right I said I'll turn you loose on him and I'll prove to you that he's my son he's got high expectations amen brother if you're going to quote brother Brian you're going to quote quote all of brother madam he's talking about that old man said he didn't have room up here to preach and brother random said I don't have time enough to preach everything I said some quote Brother Brad of can't follow me on up time would fail us even Paul said to tell about all the people who out of their low place were lifted into a high expectation you could just go through the Bible and every time Moses you take the woman at the blood issue the woman at the well the different ones the Miracles blind Bartimaeus the different things and go through there and see how their expectation became raised too high left all of a sudden because the presence of God had drawn down drawn near to them their expectations went Sky High out the roof oh brother this is like prayer remember that sister brother I'm told about they hooked up the meter to her when she was praying as a dying lady and they hooked up their scientific meter to her they'd hooked it up to another man which was a filthy letter a dirty Wicked ungodly sinful uh viciously horrific uh evil man and they hooked up the meter to him and it went One Direction all the way down to the very bottom because of his spirit and then they hooked it up to this dying lady sister supposedly dying but Christians don't die and she was praying and said that meter went all the way over brother Vance there was enough power in that to send a beam of electricity uh out into outer space and back about 20 times inside of one prayer of one woman who had high expectations uh I could tell you testimonies of people I was in a meeting and a brother raised his hand and something told me in my heart he was sitting right behind me something told me in my heart Reach Out And Touch his hand grab his hand and I turned and I grabbed his withered hand became straight right there miraculous Tower of God tears running on his eyes he said brother I was asking God for you to do that I expected it to happen I said there it goes foreign how many times do we pass by an individual because we've got a little complex about that they don't want to hear from us and maybe they don't want to hear what we've always been like maybe just preaching at them or maybe just making them feel bad putting them down bringing the law we're not of the law we're not of the letter we're of the inspired word brother this message is not LED or you don't you don't chop people up with the with the letter of this message brother this message sets free sets people free by the inspiration of high expectations brother amen but maybe that person that we've passed by is expecting something to change and maybe you're the change that they're expecting that's all the time we put it on other people don't we oh you you did this to me me and you do this to me I live with it every day with people that are blaming somebody else for 20 years ago and not moving listen we are in Christ in you the expectation of the beautiful and the miraculous amen high expectations low expectation is really just sin amen [Music] my lifesaver's gone let's bow our heads I brought my Lifesaver out to you that'll save your life if you'll believe it it'll lift you out we sing that song he brought me out of the my replay David his expectations was low he was looking at himself he's looking at his sin he's looking at his adultery looking at his murder looking all the stuff he did said how can I be a recipient of the sure mercies of David I don't deserve it true but God's a god of high expectations David God is a god of hide expectations of the beautiful and the miraculous to be brought into manifestation in our life now is there anybody sitting here today that would first of all agree that low expectations for a believer in this hour to have low expectations for a message follower or we say even a member of this church a part of this local assembly for a local assembly member of this church to have low expectations is sin do you agree with that part you must agree with the next part which is in you the whole plan wasn't Christ in Jeffersonville Christ in you I'm just Christ in brother man Apostle Paul brother bam said I'm not him I'm just here to point you to him I'm just a voice that he used if you'll believe this he'll prove it to you so high expectations is what he expects of us in spite of our situation in spite of the people that you know that are talking against you right now it doesn't phase you you got high expectations I should be like somebody tried to grab a 220 volt line and say I'm going to stop this electricity no they're not going to stop that electricity it's going to run right through them you're not going to stop God's word it's got high voltage high voltage this is a high octane high voltage message and it's so simple it all works down to the level of your expectation brother Adam said I've been in meetings I didn't even have to preach or pray for the sick said I walk out on the platform and the expectation of the people was so strong every sick person and every sinner was healed in saved before I even came out on the platform as I was walking out they were all healed and I got the quote to read it to you if you want me to and he said church that's what God wants every service he said Church if we met that same level of expectation God would do the same thing today I I believe that don't you maybe there's someone just an uplifting hand I'm not going to even look I don't have to I expect that somebody's going to lift their hand and that's all I need to know you want to raise your hand to God and say Lord my expectations has been way down in the dumps but now I'm getting a little hope hope means expectation amazing that they named that little child hope over there in India little Punjabi girl beautiful little girl she was their hope she was their expectation not aborted but living and healthy and beautiful [Music] I believe that you're living foreign and beautiful and had high hopes for you God has the same feeling towards you that's why he sent you Elijah the prophet he wasn't sent to everybody but he was sent to you because he had high hopes for you brother Thomas wasn't so cute for you you were sent to brother Tom that's because God they had high hopes for brother Thomas too we need each other we help each other create an atmosphere brother Urban that quote on the token again you create an atmosphere around you of power that makes someone wants you to say something to them God makes all things beautiful in his time this may be his day this may be the day this may be the hour and then again God can do something and you never see it but it's done that's the beauty of our God he hides himself he doesn't put on a show he just saves he changes the atmosphere you're all a miniature Creator how many want to create love when you go around create Faith around instead of doubt and fear God bless you with your hands raised but is there somebody here that brother Ted this old guy from Arizona has said something that made you think and you want to say Lord I need to have my expectations raised up again where they used to be I want to get back to that place and then go onward and onward from there I don't want to stagnate again I don't want to stagnate God bless you God bless you we're going to pray now with our heads bowed real quiet in here that's okay God can do more without any noise like brother Ramsay draw God can draw millions of gallons of water out of the ocean up into the sky to send rain over Kentucky and you never heard any of it in silence he did it man has to make a lot of noise in fanfare God doesn't have to do that God just does it because he has high expectations so we're going to pray we're going to take the advice of our sister beautiful song that she's saying I can pray you can pray we can pray when high expectations pushed by faith driven by love creates an atmosphere where God can fulfill his promise Heavenly Father it's a sacred we don't go by feelings but if I could we try to describe what it is by using our human terms I feel a sacred fee feeling here and I believe that you're doing this a great work in the hearts of your children I believe that brother Brandon said when the faith is right you don't need a prayer line you don't need all the goings-on and activities that look like a great church meeting all right when that's there you don't need anything done already heavenly father I pray that you do the work and hearts today and build their expectations High because Lord we don't want to be sinners going around in this day of the mystery of godliness the fourth Bible and acting like a form of godliness we want to be the real mystery of godliness Christ in you the hope of glory the expectation of beauty and miraculous not pray that blessing upon everyone here today bless our time Fellowship after church bless our lunchtime and continue to make us to be a blessing because you put us on this planet to be a blessing that's each one of your children father we ask you for thy Glory in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and everybody said God bless you brother Thomas you come now God be with you appreciate
