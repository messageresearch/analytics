The prodigals [singing] return and all my [singing] hope is [music] in Jesus. Thank God my yesterday's gone. [singing and music] And all my [singing and music] sins are forgi. [singing and music] And I've been washed by the blood. I'm no stranger to the prison. I've worn [singing and music] shackles and chains, but I've been [singing] freed and forgi. I'm not going back. I'll never be the same. That's why I'm singing. All my hope is [singing and music] in Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh, thank God. My yesterday's [music] [singing] gone. And all my sins are [singing] forgiven. and I [singing] washed by the sing last verse again. I'm no stranger to [singing] the prison. You remember those days? Oh, I've worn shackles [singing] and chains. [music] Hallelujah. But [singing] I've been freed and forgiven. I'm not going back. [singing] I'll [music] never be the same. That's why I'm singing. [singing] All my hope is in Jesus. Hallelujah. Well, thank God my yesterday's [singing] gone. And all my sins are [singing] forgiven. [music] and I've been [singing] washed by the blood. Give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight. [music] Aren't you thankful? You've been washed by the blood tonight. You're no longer a a slave and shackled, but you've been freed from your sins. And you've been freed and forgiven. Hallelujah. It's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. We do have several that's out we want to uh hold before the Lord and we have several needs. So, if we could uh we'll just take those needs to the Lord. And brother Brian, would you mind making your way up and we'll we'll have you pray over these needs tonight. Uh want to remember continue to remember Sister Parish. She's uh she's doing much much better. She sends her greetings. She wants to tell everybody hi. So, hi from Sister Parish. And just to remember her in prayer. She is still suffering a little bit of pain and uh I think some tingling and nerves, nerve issues in her feet. So remember her in prayer tonight if you would. And um so u brother Steve says she looks really good but she just don't even know she's got shoes on sometimes. So remember her in prayer if you would. So brother Shawn is not feeling well. He's got a fever and and sore throat tonight. So we want to remember him. Also we want to remember brother Steve. Uh uh most of you probably know his heart was out of rhythm here a little bit ago and and he had to go get it uh shocked back into rhythm. Well, oh, Satan, come scratch it again. And he's out of rhythm again. So, uh, they're going to send him to a specialist and see about doing a little procedure to try to make sure the the nerves are not interfering with [music] each other in his heart and the the crossfiring electro electrol electrodes, I guess, in his heart. So, [music] remember him in prayer. I think you said it was April. They couldn't get you until April. [music] So, we're just going to believe for a healing before then. believe God will move on the scene, put him right back in rhythm. If he created a heart, he can sure fix the heart. So, we believe that. Remember Sister Janet tonight? Uh she her legs are giving her problems. She she had a little incident. I think a dog jumped up and and [music] scratched her leg, the one that was giving her trouble. So, she's she's suffering a little bit with that. Remember her. Also, we want to remember Sister Aaliyah and sister uh or little Hie. We want to remember them. [music] Halie's having some some nightmares and waking up in in a in a terrified state and screaming and [music] you know that's just the devil. That's all that is. And we call him a tormenter. That's because he's torments. But we know somebody who can who can push the tormentor aside. So we're going to rely on Jesus tonight that he would move on the scene. Sister Robin asked that we would remember her stepdad. He's he's going to be traveling and got to be coming home from Pennsylvania. Is that right? Massachusetts up in that area up north. And he's trying to get back west over the snowstorm that's approaching. So, [music] we need the Lord to just uh watch over him and help him to make it home safely. Uh I have a note here that says uh remember a co-orker uh of of theirs uh Melinda Howard. Her son is around 10 years old and has been having a lot of health issues. His name is Landon. And we just want to uh hold him before the Lord in prayer. You know, when people ask you to pray, it's because they got confidence. And I got confidence in this church. And I got confidence in the prayers. They don't just stay here, but they reach the throne of heaven. So, [music] we'll turn the service to brother Brian here as he as he uh uh will pray over these needs and just ask that the Lord would intervene in a special way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brothers and sisters, there's no way I'll be able to remember all that. But we [music] know that God knows our needs, knows our place, knows exactly who we are. Lord God, we're just humble, Lord, this night to come before your presence, Lord. [music] Knowing that you're an allseeing God, Lord, and you know the needs of these people. You see their hearts, Lord. [music] You see their bodies, Lord. We just reach out in faith, Father, to touch you, Lord. That you would come down and minister to the needs of these people, Lord, [music] these great needs they have, Lord, both for physical healing, Lord, maybe for mental touch or whatever it is, Lord, that you'll come and be with these people this night, Lord, and have your way for a complete delivery, Lord, from these afflictions. Now Lord, as we open this service, Lord, we desire, Father, to see you touch the hearts of your people, Lord. Be with the minister, be with all portions of the service, Lord. We pray and believe, Lord, that no one will leave here tonight, Lord, without knowing you greater than they did coming in, Lord. [music] We just love you, Lord. We bring these things to you, Lord. Ask you minister to the needs of your people, Lord. And we just simply want to say that we love you. In your precious name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's uh let's turn and sing that song if we could. The Psalms 34 song. If we could pull that one up while you're standing tonight. I sought the Lord and he answered me and delivered me from every fear. Those who look on him are radium. [singing] They'll [music] never be ashamed. They'll never [singing] be ashamed. This poor man. Oh, [music] this poor man cried. And the Lord heard me [singing] [music] and save me from my eneies. The [music and singing] son of God. Hallelujah. surrounds his saints. He will deliver them. He will deliver [singing] them. Magnify the Lord. Oh, magnify the [singing] Lord with me. Come exalt [singing] his [music] name together. Glorify [singing] the Lord with me.

I lean on you. We're trying to learn some new ones. It's been requested we sing some new songs. So, we're working on them. I'll sing them if you'll help me. Okay. So, we'll sing them. I lean on [singing] you, Lord. I lean on you, Lord, for the things that I need. [music and singing] I lean on you when I don't know [singing] just what to do. I've got the [music] faith you'll see [singing] me through to supply every need. I lean on you. I lean on you, Lord. Let's try it again. I lean [singing] on you, Lord. I lean on [music] you, Lord, for the things [singing] that I need. I lean on [music] you when I don't know [singing] just what to do. I've got the faith you'll see me through to supply every need. I lean on you. Well, I've been up on [singing and music] the mountain where the sun was shining bright. I've been down in the lowest valley where the clouds were black as night. While I've been betrayed [music] like Jesus [singing] by a friend who wasn't true. But in the good times and the [music] bad times, Lord, I've learned to lean on you. I lean on you, Lord. I lean [singing] on you, Lord, for the things that I need. I [singing and music] lean on you. When I don't [singing] know just what to do, I've got the faith you'll see me through. To supply every need. I lean on you. Well, I've heard the battle raging and I prayed till the victory came. There's been times [music] I thought, Lord, do you even really know my name? But I've been blessed and I've been down to where I didn't know what to do. But in the times of joy and sorrow, Lord, I've learned I got to lean on you. I lean on you, Lord. [singing] I lean on you, Lord. for the things [singing] that I need. I lean on you. When I don't [singing] know just what [music] to do, I've got the faith you'll see me through. To supply every need. I lean on you. Let's stand. Sing it once again. I lean on you, Lord. [singing] I lean on you, Lord, for the things that I need. I [singing] lean on you when I don't know just what to do. I've got the faith you'll see me through to supply every need. I lean on you. Amen. And aren't you thankful that you've got a shoulder you can lean on? No matter what you're going through, he's there for you. Amen. Certainly good to to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Looking forward to what the Lord has in store for us. I come expecting. I hope you come expecting. Our pastor, he he preached hard this weekend and he said he's been taking the last couple days to recover and and [music] I'm sure sister Donald's been just treating him like a king and and bringing his coffee and letting him rest. But you know what? He's he's recuperated now. So, he's ready to preach again. So, pull on the gift of the Lord tonight and and pull on our pastor that we might have our needs met tonight. Let's sing if we could turn the service to brother Ber as we sing Amazing Grace tonight. Amazing grace, how sweet [singing] the sound that saved a rich. I once was lost, but [singing and music] now I was blind, but now I see. [singing] It was [singing and music] grace that taught my heart to fear and grace [singing] [music] my fears relive. [music] How precious that grace [singing] appear [music] I first believe. Praise God. Praise God. [music] Oh, praise [singing] God. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you, brother Brad. Praise God. [music] Praise God. Praise God. Praise [singing] God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise [singing] God. And when [music] the [singing] battle's all over, we shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall [singing] wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. And when the [singing] battle's over, [music] we shall wear a crown. [singing] in the new Jerusalem. Where a crown, wear a crown, [singing] wear a bright and shining crown. And [music] when the battle's [singing] over, we shall wear a crown in the new Jerusalem. Hallelujah. Give him a clap offering tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. Good evening, everyone. &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the house of the Lord. Good to see everybody. Amen. Good to look at everybody again and be back home. Certainly is kind of dreary out there. Amen. And so, Amen. But I know it's supposed to get worse this weekend. If we got coming what they're supposed to, what they're saying it's supposed to. I don't know whether we'll have service Sunday or not. I hate not to, but I'm not going to have you going across icy roads either. Amen. We're going to pre pray the power stays on. Right, &gt;&gt; Lord? Keep the power on. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you tonight. Amen. It's just good to be a house of the Lord. And thank each one for coming out tonight. That'll be all for the music. Amen. We're going to have to crank her up, ain't we? Find out just what kind of noise she's making. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we had a good time down there, Brother Hon and Brother Andrews. Amen. By God's grace, thank you for your prayers. Amen. Amen. And if there's one thing that we uh we should know, Amen. that is that prayer makes a difference. How many believes prayer changes things? Prayer makes a difference. Amen. You know, we believe in accepting Lord, I believe what you did on Calvary. It's it's all finished and it's all finished. We do believe that. But yet, look at all the times that Jesus said, "Ask and it shall be given to you." Amen. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you. Amen. So, I still believe in asking. I still believe in prayer. Amen. Having fellowship with God and so forth. Amen. And so I don't know if brother Ronald will listen to this tonight and brother Andrew, but one thing I'll say. All right. Now, devil, get on out of here. All right. That sound system. See, is that if you don't want to start a fire, don't light a match. That place is full of fumes, man. It'll kill you. Amen. Just line and match and boom, you know. Oh my, you talk about easy crowd, kind of like y'all. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we really appreciate the folks down there. They're certainly precious brothers and sisters of like faith. We're looking forward to being in heaven with them. Amen. So, praise the Lord. God bless you. Amen. I'm sure we got a lot of fumes up in here tonight, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. So, Amen. I'll tell you what, you know, we preached about an hour down there. And so, but you know, I think we had close for what would be a midweek service, which they have it on Saturday night. Instead, we didn't get out of there till 10:00, right at 10:00 from 7, 8, 9, 10. I thought, man, I thought 9:30 was long here. They go to 10 on a on a night like that. Amen. So, but it was just wonderful. Amen. when the people enter in and worship the Lord because how many believe we're entering into that state now to where we're worshiping God. Amen. Really giving God glory and honor and praise. Amen. So tonight with the help of the Lord, we'll just uh not keep you standing too too long. Um I can't think of any announcements other than not this coming Sunday, but the following Sunday, we want to take up our first offering and maybe last. I have faith that it'll probably be the last offering for our $30,000 roof. Amen. So, that's not this coming Sunday, but the following. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. That way, we can get that taken care of. Amen. And uh we'll we'll need that by let's say uh probably wait till after our meetings to actually do it. You know, we want to make sure it's good and warm so they you know, go down and and March is usually pretty cold month yet. And then middle of April is when we have our meetings and so we'll probably wait until afterwards. We certainly don't want things tore up when we have our meetings. Amen. So that's the only announcement that I can think of. Let's bow our heads, go to the author before we open the book. Lord Jesus, we come before you tonight again Lord thanking you Lord Jesus for each soul that you've brought out here. And we also thank you for each Lord person that will be streaming tonight. We ask God that you would bless them, Lord Jesus. Father, may they receive something from you, something special, Father, Lord Jesus. And we just ask God that you'll help me to get out of the way. And Lord, use the gift, Lord Jesus, that you've placed in my life, Lord, Father, and just use it, Father, to minister your word to your people that we might be edified, Lord Jesus, that we might grow into the image of Jesus Christ. We ask Lord Jesus you to bless the meditation of our heart that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to minister tonight now for we ask it in Jesus name. Amen and amen. Praise the Lord. Turn your Bibles if you will and just try get started somewhere. Boy, these glasses are not working. It's all right. I got another five. So that's all right. Amen. Amen. Y'all pray for me. I'm praying about getting that lasacic surgery done. Amen. And throw these things in the garbage. Amen. So, that's what we're praying about doing. Amen. All right. Let's turn, if you will, and I think we'll go to Revelations. Revelations 10, very familiar scriptures. Most of what we're going to be reading and talking about tonight is going to be very familiar. Amen. But it's the direction I feel led to go. So that's how we go. Ain't that right? Revelations 10 and verse 7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can be seated tonight. Amen. I want to say that uh Amen. We uh I feel led to in the things that we're going to say and some of the stories we want to tell. Amen. Uh it's not just when we preach here, it's not just for here. Isn't that right? I think we've had around average of 70 streamers or whatever. And so we also look at those who stream and being able to see it on the internet. We look at that as a channel of missionary work. Amen. Being able to reach out to people. Amen. Perhaps it can't be here. Amen. And so, uh, you know, we just want to try to try to with the help of the Lord make the things that we talk about as clear as possible. Amen. And share with the world what God has done in our day. Amen. Again, I just want to kind of pick up where we've left off. Amen. Uh and this is going to be tonight perhaps you remember when I was talking about the few different series that I had and and I wanted to preach on this day this scripture is fulfilled and this is going to kind of be that. Amen. But I want to reread a couple of quotes to start with. Amen. And then I want to after I read these, I want to kind of give you a u what I what I call a appetizer. How many wants an appetizer tonight? You anybody want to order appetizer tonight? All right, we got a little appetizer, a little something I want to say before I get into the message and then let's uh we'll just go from there. Amen. But the quote that I wanted to uh start with was Amen. And brother Brandham says, you know, coming into Christ is like going down to this great big arcade here or a variety store. Now, I like that variety store. Another place he called it a department store. Amen. Just a variety store. Amen. And so, and I look all around and there's everything in there. The shelves are all full of nice, pretty things. And everything that I like. I like that. Don't you? everything that you like. Remember a uh smoking man's filter, a thinking man's filter, a smoking man's taste. Amen. And he preaches about the taste that people have. Amen. How many knows that whatever you thirst for, whatever you have a taste for, wherever your your treasure is, that's where your heart will be also. So we have to ask ourselves what is the things that we like. How many doing right now what you like? &gt;&gt; Amen. I love coming to church. I love worshiping the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything that you like. And he says they're all mine. Every one of them belongs to me and I can go over there and take what I want to. My message tonight is called the effects of Revelations 10:7 and Malachi 4 and5. The effects. Amen. Praise the Lord. And I'll just say this. One of the effects OF MALACHI 4 IS RIGHT HERE. I don't know about you, but when I was on, THEY DIDN'T TELL ME THAT I HAD EVERYTHING. Everything that you could ever want in Christ is yours. &gt;&gt; All things are yours. Amen. And somebody out there might not quite understand what we're trying to say. So I just really want to try to scripturalize what we would say. And in first Corinthians the 3r chapter and verse 21, it says, "Therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours." Amen. All things are yours, whether palace, uh, Paul, Cphus, or the world or life or death or things present or things to come. They're all yours. How many knows we're joint hes with Christ? Jesus come, he's false heir to everything. And we're joint hes with Christ. And he said, "The meek shall inherit the earth." So we DON'T GET ALL EXCITED ABOUT A LITTLE 38 acres out there in Lewisburg. And you DON'T GET ALL EXCITED ABOUT THE FEW ACRES that you got, the nice house. Amen. The nice Chevys, Ford, Dodgers, or whatever it is that you drive. We are very, very happy because our neighbor in heaven &gt;&gt; and we are a part of this. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I LIKE THAT BECAUSE I HERE TO TELL YOU WHENEVER YOU GO, YOU could just take this here. Amen. When you talk about a variety, how many know that there's a variety of things in here? &gt;&gt; A large variety of things. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Christ is our variety store. Amen. Let me see. I don't have it. Yeah, right here it is right in front of me. I'm about to read it and I was looking for it. Just read Thomas and quit talking. All right. And Christ is our variety store. For by one spirit are we all baptized into one big variety store. Brother Bram said amen. &gt;&gt; Should we say amen? He said amen. Amen. Anything that you have need of, he will supply. If you need healing, I'll take it. You joy, I'll take it. Amen. If you need victory, I'll take it. It's all hanging around in great God's great variety store and I'm in possession. And you have possession of everything in that store when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost. We're going to take our time. Try not to go to 10. But if we don't have church this weekend, let's just make up for it tonight, maybe. Amen. How many's glad? Oh my. Another place he talks about, we ought to be the happiest people. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Happiest people on the face of the earth. I don't know about you, but I do not want to be a wannabe. Well, I want this and I'm want that. I wish I had this and I wish I had that. That's wishbone. Remember last time years ago I preached on this and I talked about if everything has been supplied. If he was here, he couldn't do anything more for you. Then guess what? YOU ARE WHAT YOU WANT to be. &gt;&gt; You are what you want to be. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE HE'S WAITING ON YOU NOW. AMEN. &gt;&gt; There ain't no more waiting on God. He's waiting on us. &gt;&gt; That's what he preached. HE CARES. DO YOU CARE? He said, you got to now care first because he cared. Now, do you care? God wants to see your reaction. How many BELIEVE THAT OVER IN REVELATIONS WHEN THEY ALL OF THEM ARE SAYING there's a great voice and the shout and the uh the I hate that I can't remember. So we just go to it. After these things, I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, hallelujah, salvation, glory, and honor, and power unto the Lord our God. In other words, HOW MANY KNOW THAT God invested HIMSELF IN CALVARY? HE WENT AND HE PURCHASED IT. HE MADE A WAY. He paid for you and I. AND NOW THERE'S TO COME A TIME WHEN HE GETS A RETURN ON WHAT he did. &gt;&gt; How many WOULD SAY WITH ME, I AM his return. &gt;&gt; I AM HIS [screaming] RETURN. IN OTHER WORDS, IF HE PAID FOR SOMETHING, HE'S GOING TO GET SOMETHING. HIS WORD IS NOT GOING TO GO OUT AND BE VOID. IT'S NOT GOING TO COME BACK TO HIM VOID, BUT IT'S GOING TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT IT HAS SAID THAT IT'S going to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And he's going to have people that take advantage, amen, of his grace and of his mercy and accept and become beneficiaries of Calvary. &gt;&gt; How many glad to be a beneficiary? Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. Now, something for us that I feel Lord just kind of I felt like he spoke to me today. Amen. And it felt like something that we need to do. Amen. This is kind of the appetizer before we get into the message. It's found in Malachi. Now, we know that Jesus said that if any man come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. How many knows that if you're not willing to FORSAKE ALL TO FOLLOW ME, you're not worthy to be my disciple. Whether that's far, that's uh land or houses or or wife or husband or family. Come on now. Family, you know, it's the hardest thing. That's blood. But he GOD EXPECTS our best. &gt;&gt; He expects our all. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he really doesn't accept anything less. No, it really won't. And so in Malachi 1 and verse 6, we're going to start. A son honorth his father and a servant his master. If I then be a father, where is my honor? If I be A MASTER, WHERE IS my fear? Sayeth the Lord of hosts unto you, oh ye priests that despise my name, and ye say, "Wherein have we despised thy name?" YOU OFFER POLLUTED BREAD upon my altar, and you say, "Wherein have we polluted thee?" In that you say, "The table of the Lord is contemptable. And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? Offer it now unto thy governor, will he be pleased with thee?" Amen. No, he won't be pleased with thee or accept thy person. He'd tell you to get on out of here, wouldn't he? How many when we come to church, not just church, BUT WHEREVER WE ARE, we ought to be giving God our best. &gt;&gt; Now I pray, pray thee, beseech God, if he'll be gracious unto us. This has been by your means. Will he regard your person? Sayaith the Lord of hosts. Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for not? Neither do you kindle fire of mine under the altar. I have no pleasure in you, sayaeth the Lord of hosts. Neither will I accept an offering at your hand. Remember what brother Bam said about this that they came to church all the time. They did the offerings. They did it all, but they did it out of tradition AND NOT FROM THEIR HEART ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the real meaning behind IT ANYMORE. JUST BECOME A THING THEY DID. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD, IT OUGHT TO BE A FRESH REAL thing every time. &gt;&gt; See, from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles. How many believe that's right? That's who WE MAGNIFY. THAT'S WHAT WE GLORIFY. THERE'S NO name under heaven given whereby we must BE SAVED. THERE'S NO NAME THAT is above Jesus' name. His name is above every name that is named. And you ARE AND I ARE PART OF THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS SCRIPTURE. His name is great. Amen. Amen. For my name shall be great among the heathens, sayaith the Lord. But you've profane profaneed it in that ye say the table of the Lord is polluted and the fruit thereof. Even his meat is contemptable. Ye have SAID SO. BEHOLD, WHAT a weariness it is. Oh man, twin night again. Huh? I'm too tired. Huh? I'll tell you what. I I I MEANT TO PRAY, BUT I had I was behind on my schedule and I had to get to work. Ain't that something? How, man? I'M TELLING YOU WHAT, WE'LL MAKE SURE WE'RE out work on time. That's more important than taking time and making sure you're on time for prayer. &gt;&gt; That was free. I ain't even got that wrote down. &gt;&gt; But that's I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT GOD'S TALKING ABOUT. AIN'T YOU? AMEN. Our jobs. Amen. It's important IF YOU HAVE A JOB AND WORK FOR SOMEBODY TO BE THERE ON TIME. HOW MANY TRIES TO BE ON TIME ON HAVING A JOB? That's right. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT RESPECT FOR YOUR BOSS. YOU HONOR YOUR BOSS. GOD forbid you don't. Oh, no. BUT THE LORD JUST SEEMS TO LET YOU SLIDE. WELL, HE'S WATCHING, FOLKS. He notices. HOW MANY NOTICE? HE NOTICES THE LITTLE THINGS THAT you do and the little things that you don't do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Well, it's coming. Maybe I better just say it. LIKE A WORSHIP. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT WHEN YOU GET OVER THERE, I MEAN, WE OUGHT TO GIVE GOD SOME REAL WORSHIP. when you get OVER THERE ACCORDING TO SCRIPTURES AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAID AMEN AND OVER THERE EVERYBODY SAID AND THEY ALL THE WHOLE GROUP SAID HALLELUJAH amen praise the Lord [screaming] &gt;&gt; let ME ASK YOU THIS WHEN YOU GET OVER THERE IS IT GOING TO BE A WEIRD THING FOR YOU YELL OUT AMEN I ain't never done that before &gt;&gt; hallelujah where'd that come from I I AIN'T NEVER DONE THAT IN CHURCH MORE. &gt;&gt; A CHRISTIAN OUGHT TO PUNCTUATE EVERY WORD OF GOD with a &gt;&gt; amen. Come on, people. Amen. That's what WE COME TO CHURCH FOR IS TO WORSHIP HIM in spirit AND IN TRUTH. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE TRUTH GOES FORTH, AMEN. we worship with a amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I PITY ANY PREACHERS THAT AMEN. that [clears throat and cough] has TO CLEAR HIS THROAT AFTER SOMEBODY says amen or or screams a little. &gt;&gt; No, it's a sickum to a really holy ghost preacher. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GO GET HIM. THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER. Did that help you any? &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "You have brought, listen, you have BROUGHT THAT WHICH WAS torn and that which was lame and that which was sick. Thus ye brought an offering." Now, let me tell you something. I'm very grateful for where y'all are at. And I'm not trying to say y'all are a bunch of lame, sick people bringing all kinds of lame things. But I am saying I'm very glad for where we brought us, but maybe we can go a little bit more higher. &gt;&gt; Maybe a little more. &gt;&gt; Get into it a little more. &gt;&gt; Sit on the edge of the seat, right? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Do like the preachers do back there sometimes. And preachers SAY SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY LIKE THEM PREACHER STAND UP SAY. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. I just CAN'T TAKE THAT SITTING DOWN. I GOTTA stand up to eat that food. &gt;&gt; Means something to you. Praise the Lord. Let's not come and offer God our second best. are seconds. I'll tell you what, I worked like a dog today and I worked hard and I made my boss happy, but when I come to church, it was time to rest and fold my arm. No, you try to save some of that energy. I might as well say it. I'M THINKING TAKE TIME OFF A LITTLE EARLY ON WEDNESDAY. GET YOU A NAP. THAT WAY WHEN YOU COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD, YOU'RE REFRESHED AND YOU'RE READY. &gt;&gt; Anybody ready? &gt;&gt; You sound ready. You sound ready. [applause] AMEN. WHY? SACRIFICE. MAKE A LITTLE SACRIFICE. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO MAKE A SACRIFICE. AMEN. DON'T COME TO CHURCH AND OFFER THE SACRIFICE OF quietness and no smiles, no grins, no hallelujah. No praises. I DON'T WANT the lame. You know the story. Some people go to baseball game. Ain't that right? Their kid drives a home run. Something happens, man. They pull the hat plum off. The little round part of the hat stays and the rim comes down over. [laughter] THEY BECOME FOOLS. [screaming] MANIC excited they come to church. I'm not an emotional person. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU BETTER BECOME AN EMOTIONAL PERSON. DON'T BE SO ex don't give the devil OR THE WORLD OR YOUR PLEASURES SOMETHING MORE THAN WHAT YOU GIVE GOD. GOD'S WATCHING. [applause] GOD NOTICES THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY WANTS THIS CHURCH TO COME UP TO A HIGHER LEVEL? &gt;&gt; WELL, then that means you means you need to come up to a higher level. Oh, no. Don't just sit THERE AND SAY, "YEAH, THE CHURCH DOES, BUT I DON'T KNOW that it's going to be me." No. Uh-uh. [screaming] You come up to a HIGHER LEVEL. YOU START OFFERING GOD THE BEST. &gt;&gt; I never forget WHEN I'D SHOOT A BIG OLD BUCK. AMEN. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'D RUN TO THE HOUSE. I'D RUN BACK TO I GOT HIM. I GOT HIM. I SAID, I'M VICTORIOUS. I'M VICTORIOUS. &gt;&gt; HEY, IF I CAN DO THAT FOR A LITTLE OLD DEER. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE GOD OF HEAVEN THAT SAVED MY SOUL [screaming] AND FILLED ME WITH THE HOLY GHOST? AMEN. YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO do a LITTLE JIG FOR GOD. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; That's right. WE DON'T NEED THAT SECOND STUFF. DON'T DO IT. AMEN. When it comes to our hunting equipment, we got to have the best. Ain't that right? That's right. I got to have that $2,000 vi not viper. What is it, Micah? What's my crossbow named? Raven, thank you very much. That's right. A raven that'll Amen. IT SHOOT 100 YARDS AND IT'LL HIT A 3/4 INCH HIGH AND A 3/4 inch [snorts] to the left at 100 yards. That's further than you can see probably. Huh? We got to have the best. You know what the most expensive meat there is? The most expensive meat that I know of is venison. It's expensive now. That's right. I PROBABLY SPENT 800 BUCKS ON SOME cameras this year. Did I shoot a deer? [laughter] I don't think I even shot it here. Oh my. But ain't that right? We'll do all of that. Then we come to the house of God and buddy, our wallets close up. I got to watch my money. I gota watch my offering. &gt;&gt; $2, $5. Spend $1,000 or so for something else. What? Come and give God your second. No. How many believe God wants your first? Amen. Praise the Lord. Hunting equipment. Amen. Our jobs. Amen. We'll spend endless hours. Is that right? To make our business a success. Endless hours. AND A COUPLE HOURS A WEEK. COUPLE HOURS A WEEK. MAYBE IT takes four hours to get here and go back home. Isn't that right? Twice. That's eight hours out of how many in a week? It's a whole lot, isn't it? Well, I just can't do it, Brother Ber. No, no, no. You don't want to. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you wanted to, you could. &gt;&gt; You would make a way. &gt;&gt; You make way. You make a way for the things that you like &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT'S A TREASURE TO YOU. YOU MAKE A WAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE NEED TO MAKE A WAY FOR GOD MORE. IF YOU WANT MORE OF GOD, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE HIM MORE of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that when streamers are watching, I believe when THEY'RE WATCHING, THEY OUGHT TO SEE a preacher. Amen. WHEN THEY SEE THE PREACHER, THEY'RE SEEING A PREACHER THAT IS PREACHING IT THE WAY IT ought to be preached. &gt;&gt; Don't you believe that? &gt;&gt; Oh, it might not, THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE IT REAL WELL. A LOT OF TIMES THE THING THAT SAY WE DON'T LIKE REAL WELL, BUT that's just about the right kind of preaching. HELLO TO GET US ON OUR TOES because it's so easy to backslide. It's so easy to become calm. It's so easy. BUT I THANK THE HOLY SPIRIT TONIGHT THAT HE WAKES US BACK UP AGAIN. AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT he us GIVES US A LITTLE SPANKING? AMEN. AND SAID, "LOOK, YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. [applause] Can't keep going on doing the same thing expecting different results unless you're crazy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the STREAMER STREAMS, GUESS WHAT? THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SEE the real kind of worship. &gt;&gt; The way that people worship. &gt;&gt; Now, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, AMEN. WHEN THE PREACHER'S PREACHING, THE WORD'S GOING FORTH and everything's quiet. No. No amens, no hallelujah. That's not what they ought to see. &gt;&gt; No, they ought to be able to hear amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE STREAMERS OUGHT TO BE SAYING AMEN. &gt;&gt; Your wife ought to be able to hear you say amen. &gt;&gt; Your husband ought to be able to hear you say amen. That's right. It shouldn't be awkward. It shouldn't be weird. It should be perfectly normal. YOUR KIDS OUGHT TO JOIN RIGHT IN THERE. &gt;&gt; You ought to get THEM ALL DOWN BESIDE THE COUCH THERE AND SIT down and really stream it. &gt;&gt; Instead of eating that peanut butter crackers and soup and steak and salad, WHATEVER ELSE YOU'RE CHOWING DOWN while you're listening to A SERVICE, GIVE GOD SOME GLORY. GIVE HIM SOME RESPECT AND SAY, "LET'S HAVE SOME REVERENCE FOR THE WORD OF GOD GOING FORWARD." WE DON'T HAVE A BUNCH OF SOUPS AND STUFF UP IN HERE. [applause] WE DON'T CARRY NO DRINKS IN HERE. We don't carry on with business in here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. God wants your best. You can only GIVE YOUR BEST BY being sincere, honest. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And being dedicated. You got to be dedicated to God. THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS. [snorts] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. All right. So that was just what I felt led of the spirit to say concerning not letting things become common, not getting lukewarm, and not offering anything else that you do more glory than what you give God, &gt;&gt; more respect or time than what you give God. &gt;&gt; And I hope I never have to say that again. I hope that changes us and we can say from this moment on from what brother Ber said tonight because I know it's the word of God even Jesus said you can't love anything else more than what you love me I want all your strength you got to love God with all your heart all your mind all your strength and all your soul all that's within you God wants that we are to meditate upon him day and night &gt;&gt; amen and then you will have good successmen Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As I as I just in the last couple of weeks, I guess, Amen. begin to ponder the things and looked at these things again and look at Revelation 10:7, look at Malachi 4, I REALIZE WHAT REALLY HAS HAPPENED, WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON AND WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN OUR GENERATION. Cuz you SEE WHERE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, YOU KNOW, WE OUGHT TO BE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE ON THE FACE of the earth. And he said, "Because we see THE RESURRECTED CHRIST OF THE 2,000 YEARS AGO HERE AMONG US, DOING THE SAME things that [screaming] he did, PROVING HIMSELF ALIVE." AND THAT'S WHY WE OUGHT TO BE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT IN SOME ISMS. WE'RE NOT IN SOME DEAD CHURCHES ANYMORE. NO, WE'RE [screaming] A PART OF THE LIVING CHURCH, THE LIVING CHRIST. AMEN. THE EFFECTS OF MALACHI 4, which we need to read. Oh, aren't you glad for Malachi 4? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for Revelation 10:7? &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to look at some of the things that that did for us. Amen. Malachi 4 says, "Behold, a day cometh that shall burn as in oven, and all the proud, and all that DO WICKEDLY SHALL BE STUBBLE, and the DAY THAT COMETH SHALL BURN THEM UP, says the Lord of hosts." I was just reading today studying. Brother Bram says he believed that the whole United States is going to be nothing but ashes. That whole United States. And I thought, my my my. So, I'm going to give you some advice. If you are in the tribulation period, go to Canada. Go to Europe. Go somewhere else cuz you're not safe here. [laughter] I don't know. You know, he talked about we know the whole world's going to burn eventually. Isn't that right? The whole world's going on fire. So, it's not going to be a safe place. You might have a couple more years. I don't know just how it'll all go. But I'm here to tell you, if you're here in that time, you know what you got coming. You got a fire coming. &gt;&gt; There is a fire coming. There is a fire coming. Thus saith the scripture, there's a fire coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they shall be stubble in the day that cometh shall burn them up, sayaith the Lord of hosts. And it shall leave them neither root nor branch. Amen. Praise the Lord. BROTHER BAM SAYS WHEN THAT FIRE COMES, he's going to burn all of the germs and all of the sickness and all of the diseases and EVERYTHING ELSE. IT'S ALL GOING TO BE BURNT. ANNIHILATED. JUST BURNT. But I like this. The world's going TO BE BURNT. BUT somebody say but. &gt;&gt; How many glad for the butt. That's right. Amen. But unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings. How many believe he did that? He rose. AMEN. WITH HEALING IN his wings. BUT SAYS, "WHAT MAKES US SO HAPPY TO SEE THE GREAT SIGNS AND WONDERS, THE GREAT POWERS OF GOD OF PEOPLE GETTING HEALED, THE BLIND EYES COMING OPEN, the dead RAISED IN OUR GENERATION." YOU MIGHT NOT HEAR NOTHING ELSE FROM THIS PREACHER. YOU MAY NOT HAVE NOTHING ELSE, BUT THIS YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR. AND THAT IS THAT JESUS CHRIST CAME IN OUR DAY AND DID WHAT HE SAID THAT WE WOULD DO. THE WORKS THAT I DO SHALL YOU DO ALSO. IN MY NAME, THEY'LL CAST OUT DEVILS. THEY'LL TAKE UP SERVANTS. IF THEY DRINK ANY DEADLY THING, AMEN, IT SHALL NOT HARM THEM. THEY SHALL LAY HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEY SHALL RECOVER. WE'VE SEEN THE DEAD RAISED MULTIPLE TIMES. WE'VE SEEN ALL OF THESE GREAT HEALINGS TAKE PLACE IN OUR GENERATION. And I'm going to read you a couple stories here probably be yet if I had get a chance of what God has done. Because you see, we are to declare his glory among the heathen and his marvelous works among all nations. How many believe that's what WE'RE TO DO? DECLARE WHAT GOD HAS DONE, is doing, and will do, BUT ESPECIALLY WHAT HE'S DONE IN OUR GENERATION. How many believe the effects of Malachi I BELIEVE THE EFFECTS OF MALACHI 4 IS GOING TO put a bride in the rapture? I don't care HOW LONG TIME GOES. I DON'T care who doubts it. I don't care who walks away FROM IT. AMEN. THERE'S GOING TO COME A BRIDE OUT OF THIS MALACHI 4. SHE'S GOT TO BE WITHOUT SPOT AND WITHOUT WRINKLE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [snorts] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE, HOW MANY GLAD TO SEE THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING OLD AND FORMAL AND WE'RE NOT GOING INTO THE CYCLE OF DEATH. AMEN. AND ICICLES HANGING OFF OUR SAND. [screaming] NO, WE'RE GETTING HOTTER ALL THE TIME. WE'RE GETTING AWAY FROM LUKEWARMNESS. WE'RE GETTING MORE FIRED UP ALL THE TIME. WHY? IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S WHAT HE'S DOING IN YOU. IT'S WHAT HE'S DOING IN ME. HE PROMISED THAT THIS ROCK WILL NOT FALL. WE WILL NOT FALL. WE WILL NOT GO BY THAT WAY. [sighs] &gt;&gt; You see, HE CAME TO CALL US OUT. HOW MANY BELIEVE GOD IN THIS GENERATION, MALACHI WAS TO CALL US OUT AND TO RESTORE US? THE EFFECTS OF MALACHI WAS TO RESTORE THE HEARTS of the children back to the fathers. Behold, verse five, behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. John the BAPTIST WAS THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE LORD. This is THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD. Brother Bannon, when he WAS ON THE OHIO RIVER BAPTIZING THE SEVEN THINGS, PURSING A VOICE OUT OF HEAVEN, CAME AND SAID, "AMEN, AS JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS SENT TO FORERUN MY FIRST COMING, YOUR MESSAGE IS GOING TO FORUN MY SECOND." AND HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THE EFFECTS OF MALACHI 4 IS? AMEN. IS IT'S GOING TO INTRODUCE JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. INTO THE SKIES. NOT BACK TO THE WORLD AGAIN. NOT TO THE EARTH AGAIN. NOT SET FOOT ON THE EARTH AGAIN. BUT TO TAKE US into heaven. &gt;&gt; IN THE SKIES. BUT ALSO Luke 17:30 THAT WE MENTION SO OFTEN. AMEN. THUS SHALL IT BE AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS of Noah, as it as it was in the days of Lot. Thus shall IT BE WHEN THE SON OF man or prophetic ministry once again is revealed. Amen. Praise the Lord. And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. Remember one Elijah doing two things. turn the hearts of the fathers to the children which was the with the um is Israelite fathers capus and all of them he WAS TRYING TO TURN THEM TO THE HEARTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT THE children and then he'd have to do another work and THE HEART OF THE CHILDREN BACK TO THEIR FATHERS LEA COME AND SMITE THE EARTH WITH A curse how many believes that sooner or later each and every one of us needs to fulfill that scripture. &gt;&gt; Our heart has been turned back &gt;&gt; to restore. &gt;&gt; RESTORE. And I thought, YOU KNOW, WE ARE TO BE RESTORED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FAITH, BACK TO THE BIBLE. This becomes a new book to us. &gt;&gt; WHEN IT'S RESTORED, IT LOOKS LIKE A NEW CAR AGAIN. WHEN THAT ENGINE'S RESTORED, IT LOOKS BRAND NEW AGAIN. AMEN. WHEN IT'S REBUILT, AMEN, IT PURR LIKE IT DID AT FIRST. THAT'S THE WAY THAT THE CHURCH IS. AMEN. IT OUT OF PRAYER LIKE THE FIRST CHURCH. BUT I WANT TO SAY THIS, WE'RE NOT JUST RESTORED BACK TO THERE, BUT WE'RE RESTORED ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHERE ADAM AND EVE WAS BEFORE THE FALL, EXCEPT FOR THIS PHYSICAL BODY. HOW MANY BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN RESTORED? THAT'S WHAT IT HAS. WOO. That's what it's done. Brought a restoration. I want to talk with the help of the Lord. Amen. On that Malachi 4 also manifested and fulfilled the scriptures of that there'll be a day that's neither light nor dark, but in the evening time it shall be light. We'll get to that in a minute. but restored. How many believes we've been restored? The food, THIS BIBLE, THE word has been restored. Now, this Bible and everything about it hasn't really changed. Luther and them, you know, they they they uh King James version, I guess King James, you know, that's what our version is it, but Luther first uh uh translated into Ger German the f the first Bible, the first thing it was done. And that's why the Amish, they'll stay with the German Bible. That's the original. They don't like this here. This is second time it was done. But Luther did it first and he did it into Germany into German. So they read high German. Well, that's fine and dandy, but guess what? We had a prophet come along and said, "This is the version you ought to keep. This is what you go with. This what he God watches over his word." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good enough for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. But what did he do? He came back and he would preach. She would preach things like, you know, that it's got to be more THAN JUST A HANDSHAKE, MORE THAN JUST CHURCH HORNING. We started BACK AND SAID, "YOU MUST be born again. &gt;&gt; By what spirit are we all baptized into one body and become members IN PARTICULAR, BACK TO THE ORIGINAL WORD?" &gt;&gt; Brings the original power. &gt;&gt; Brings us back to where we're supposed to be. Amen. All right. Puts us back on the right foundation. &gt;&gt; I could start here and go through the entire message for this series. Entire message. I don't know just how long we'll go, but it'll certainly be longer than tonight. Amen. You love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember in the Philadelphia church age, I believe it was just before Leadsia, Jesus said, "Behold, I have set before thee an open door." An open door. How many knows what the door is? In the next age, that o that door would become open. Amen. We find out that Jesus is that door. Now, Malachi 4 to me was like a window, a window that God opens. Amen. And not just a window open perhaps, but let's just say the shades are pulled back from the window. Why do you put a window in your house in the first place? To let light in. Amen. But you put a bunch of curtains over it and it don't let light in. But Malachi 4 opened up the shades. &gt;&gt; IT WAS SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN THE HEALINGS WERE TAKING PLACE, THE DISCERNMENT WAS GOING FORTH THAT JESUS CHRIST WAS SHINING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. AND OTHERS WOULD SAY, "WELL, I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT. MY DENOMINATION DON'T TEACH IT AND GO BACK AND STAY IN YOUR DENOMINATION WHEN THAT VINDICATION HAS BEEN THERE. JESUS CHRIST COMES AND DOES THE VERY SAME THING THAT HE DID AT WITH THE WOMAN AT THE WELL DISCERNED HER THOUGHTS AND INTENTS OF THE HEART AND SHE SAID RAN INTO THE CITY. HE SAYS WELL NOT BEFORE SHE ran into the city he said he said we know when THE MESSIAH WHEN HE COMES HE'LL do these things. She said that the Jesus she EVEN SHE A HARLOT PROSTITUTE KNEW WHAT THE MESSA SIGN WOULD [screaming] BE. &gt;&gt; IS IT SAD THAT HARLOT KNEW IT BUT THIS GENERATION OF PREACHERS DIDN'T know it? THAT SAME SIGN DONE THOUSANDS OF TIME AND THEY CAN WALK AWAY FROM IT. NO. But Bam says THEY GO INTO THE BASEMENT. THEY SHUT THE DOOR AND THEY SAY THE SUN'S NOT SHINING. NO. NO. NO. THE SUN'S NOT SHINING. What if I told you it was dark outside? It's dark outside. You say, "No, brother B, it ain't dark. You go OUTSIDE AND IT'S STILL DARK. IT'S DARK." NO, it's not dark. If you wouldn't be willing to acknowledge that, I'd say there's something wrong up in the up in here. Few screws loose. I believe Brother Bam said there's something mentally wrong with people. There's some, let me say this both here and out there. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH SOMEBODY THAT WILL NOT accept proof. won't accept proof. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO MANY TIMES THE PROPHET CAME SAY NOW IF I'VE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH IT'LL LINE UP THE WORD IF JESUS CHRIST IF HE DON'T BACK IT UP YOU AIN'T GOT TO BELIEVE IT BUT IF HE'LL come and that's what he came in one place he says you know you know there's a lot of heathens and so forth that can't make the word of God live he says but God's helped me to be able to show the world that Jesus Christ is alive. that he's alive, that he's resurrected, he's among us. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS LIGHT? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT LIGHT WAS. LIGHT WAS WHEN WHEN THE PROPHET OF GOD WOULD COME AND HE WOULD TAKE, I MEAN, those things like Malach OR UH MATTHEW 28 OF THE WATER BAPTISM AND HE BRING TO LIGHT JUST WHAT REALLY THE NAME OF THE FATHER, SON, and the holy ghost is. AND THEN JESUS CHRIST SO MANY TIME WOULD COME AND PROVE AND VINDICATE IT. And he says that's what gives us joy to know that Jesus Christ backs up his word. Amen. And he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Let's look at this light for a minute. Now, we could take the thought of light for for a long time, but we'll try to just find what the Lord would want us to say. And uh I'm going to skip over. Well, no, I'm not this light that Malachi 4 brought. And I think the uh Zechariah 14 is where it talks about Zechariah 14 and six. I don't know if you have that or not. I didn't put a sticker in here. Zachchariah. Zephaniah. Zachchariah. Just before Malachi, isn't it? That's Zephaniah. I hope this is the right scripture. Yeah. In Zechariah 14, I do have a sticker. Zechariah 14:6 says, "And it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark. But it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day nor night, BUT IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT at evening time it shall be light. &gt;&gt; David said, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, a light unto my trapine path." &gt;&gt; Amen. So we know that the word is light. And how MANY KNOWS JESUS WAS THE WORD? In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. Amen. And in VERSE 12 IT SAYS the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And in him was life. How many believe that in Christ in Jesus was life and his life was the light of men. Jesus said if you cannot believe me believe my works. What the life that it is. How many knows that our life speaks louder than our words do? Our life is light. Jesus says, "I'm the light of the world." And he also said, "Ye are the light of the world." How many believes we're the light? We are the effects of Malachi 4. We are the effects OF REVELATIONS 10:7. In the days of THE VOICE OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL, WHEN HE SHALL BEGIN to sound, the whole mystery of God should be finished as he has DECLARED TO HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT THAT SEVENTH ANGEL MALACHI 4, THAT SEVENTH ANGEL WAS ALSO MALACHI 4, as we found out, and that angel is one that opened up the whole book OF REVELATION. HE OPENED IT up and began TO REVEAL THE CHURCH AGES, which is the first three chapters of Revelation. All right, we get into a little bit of teaching now. Is that all right? Amen. Amen. I just want to say this, the here and out there. The Bible says in Revelations 1 and3, "BLESSED IS HE that readeth and they that hear the words OF THIS PROPHECY." IN OTHER WORDS, TO BE able to understand this book of Revelation, you're a blessed person. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IF YOU AREN'T if you don't IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE REVELATION of what this is, and then most likely you're going to be deceived. &gt;&gt; But the mark of the beast lays in here. YOU GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT THE MARK OF THE BEAST IS. SO YOU DON'T GET THE MARK OF THE BEAST. YOU FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW HOW THAT THE DEVIL WORKED IN THE SEALS AND IN THE CHURCH AGES. How he works and what he does. I like that scripture. Blessed is he that hear they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which were written therein. For the time is at hand. And then he goes to talking about uh basically oh my you'd have to study the church age book to go through all these things where he's in the midst he was in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot g about the paps a golden girdle his head had hairs hairs white like wool [snorts] we don't have that picture up there do we amen white as snow his eyes were a flame afar. Amen. And then all all three re chapters of Revelation there talks about the church ages, everything that happened last in the last 2,000 years. Amen. But he didn't stop there. I like this because this and we'll get into this here in a minute. Um because in the fourth chapter Revelations, I've always liked this scripture because after the church ages, he says, "And after this, I looked and behold a door was open in heaven." Now, how many KNOWS THAT A DOOR is a place of entry or it's a an avenue or a channel to go from one place to the other? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Well, how many knows when Jesus came, he was the door. Amen. HE BRIDGED THE GAP. HE OPENED UP THE WAY FOR MAN TO COME BACK. AMEN. And to be UNITED WITH ALMIGHTY GOD. HE CLOSED THE CHA HE BRIDGED the chasm. Not closed it, BUT BRIDGED THE CHASM. AMEN. BETWEEN GOD and man to bring us back into fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; How many is glad to be in fellowship with God? &gt;&gt; You might be my friend today. You might not be my friend tomorrow. But I'm here to tell you, he is a friend that sticks closer than a brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is more precious than anybody that you'll ever associate with in this world. He's the most dearest person that you have. How many believe that to walk with him, to fellowship with him every day, &gt;&gt; you can sit on your couch and nobody else talk to you, but guess what? He'll talk to you. YOU CAN FELLOWSHIP WHEREVER YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; So he's that door. He said an open door. HE HAD AN OPEN DOOR WAS IN HEAVEN. Opened in heaven. AND THE FIRST VOICE WHICH I were heard was as the voice of a trumpet talking with with ME WHICH SAID, "COME UP HIGHER. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THINGS WHICH MUST be hereafter. How many know as IF WE CAN TRULY SAY THAT IT WAS 2,000 years later before WE EVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT? &gt;&gt; Even brother Bam said ministers, amen, theologians and everybody HAS PROBED AT IT AND COME UP WITH ALL KINDS OF CONCLUSIONS. But you and I HAVE HAD A PROPHET MESSENGER. AMEN. THAT GOD WOULD COME DOWN and say, "No, no, no, no. That's not what it is. THAT WHITE HORSE, YOU KNOW, THAT WASN'T CHRIST. THAT WAS THE ANTICHRIST. He was about to make a mistake. &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD FOR THAT? YOU AIN'T GOT TO WORRY. YOU AIN'T GOT TO YOU AIN'T GOT TO WORRY. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, he goes there and he shows us. Amen. He begin to show us. What did he show? He showed the the throne and one sat upon the throne. Before that we were in we were in u in in a dismal day. People that WILL BAPTIZE IN FATHER, SON, AND THE HOLY GHOST. PEOPLE THINK THERE'S THREE GODS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU'RE STILL IN THE DARK AGES. YOU'RE STILL IN A DISMAL. YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE IF IT'S THREE OR THREE IN ONE, one in three, and oh my. AMEN. BUT THIS PASSAGE CAME TO TELL US THAT Jesus is God. &gt;&gt; I AM HE WHICH WAS DEAD AND AM ALIVE forever more and have THE KEYS OF HELL AND DEATH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ONE SAT ON THE THRONE. There's one God, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, ONE NAME GIVEN under heaven whereby you must be saved. &gt;&gt; NOT TWO. IT'S JUST ONE NAME GIVEN UNDER heaven whereby you must be saved. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE FLOODGATES BECOME OPEN. HE RESTORED US BACK TO [screaming] WHAT WE REALLY NEEDED TO KNOW GOD. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS? REVELATION. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WE NEEDED REAL GENUINE FAITH. AMEN. IT'S GOT TO BE BY REVELATION, PERSONAL REVELATION TO YOU. IF GOD don't personally REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, AMEN, YOU HAVE A PERSONAL REVELATION. ALL YOUR MOM AND DADDY'S TEACHING won't hold you. &gt;&gt; IT'LL NEVER GIVE YOU PEACE. NOW, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THAT PERSONAL REVELATION. AND THERE IS NOT ENOUGH DEVILS in hell TO EVER TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I HAVE BEEN ONCE YOUNG AND NOW I AM OLD. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, GOD DON'T FAIL. GOD HOLDS YOU. YOU'VE GOT A REAL EXPERIENCE WITH GOD. YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT IT ISN'T YOU HOLDING, BUT IT'S GOD HOLDING ON TO YOU. HE GIVE YOU A REVELATION. AND I CAN'T GO. HE WON'T LET ME GO. &gt;&gt; HE WON'T LET YOU GO. &gt;&gt; ANYWAY, that's another avenue I'd like to take. But let's just talk on light for just a couple more minutes. Amen. light. We all walk in the light. Such a beautyful light. Walk where the dew drops of mercy are bright. Amen. Aren't those mercy dew drops bright to know that you never did it in the first place? &gt;&gt; God knew you before the foundation of the world. That's some really nice dew drops. The dew drops OF MERCY ARE BRIGHT. SHINE ALL AROUND ME BY DAY and by night. IT MEANS SO MUCH. HALLELUJAH. AREN'T YOU GLAD TO BE A PART OF THE fulfillment &gt;&gt; that in the evening time it shall be light. &gt;&gt; We're walking in the EVENING LIGHT. THAT'S WHY OUR CHURCH IS NAMED EVENING LIGHT TABERNACLE. AMEN. We believe in the evening light. NOT IN LUTHER'S LIGHT, NOT IN WESLEY'S LIGHT, NOT IN THE AGES GONE [screaming] BY LIGHT, BUT IN THE EVENING TIME LIGHT WHEN THE FULL REVELATION OF THE WHOLE PLAN OF GOD HAS BEEN MADE KNOWN TO OF US. AND REALIZE THAT IS HE IS THE FIRST, HE IS THE LAST, HE'S THE BEGINNING, HE'S THE END, &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE PART OF THAT. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT PART OF THOSE THAT ARE PREDESTINATED UNTO CONDEMNATION. NO, WE ARE A PART OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN PREDESTINATED UNTO GLORY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Anybody listening the church here tonight, I want TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. DON'T let this message become common TO YOU. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET IT BECOME DULL [screaming] TO YOU. DON'T LET THE THE THE THE THE WALK THAT YOU'VE GOT WITH GOD, DON'T LET IT BECOME DULL. IF IT DOES, I HOPE YOU GET SO MISERABLE UNTIL YOU CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOU GET BACK DOWN TO THE ALTAR AND SAY, "GOD, I [screaming] BACKSLID. I'M NOT WHERE I OUGHT TO BE. I WANT TO BE ON FIRE FOR YOU." &gt;&gt; How many believe you used to be used to coal used to co WE USED TO USE COAL OIL. AMEN. WE USED TO LIGHT A MATCH AND WE USED TO HAVE FIRE FOR OUR LIGHT. AMEN. I BELIEVE WE STILL NEED SOME OF THAT. AMEN. LET YOUR FIRE BE YOUR LIGHT. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. God is good, isn't he? Well, I'm going to skip a lot because I want to try to with the help of the Lord perhaps drive the nail in here just for a little bit because we know that this is not something that man has done. This is not something that brother Brandham did. This is something that the Lord Jesus Christ that resurrected 2,000 years ago ago did through his prophet that he sent said he would send. Amen. And I can tell you assuredly that what you do with this prophet you do to Jesus. know assuredly that what you do whether you accept or reject God's prophet is what you he that receiveth you receiveth me. Ain't that what Jesus said? He receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. And it goes vice versa. If you reject the one, you reject the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might not like like I said earlier, you might not hear nothing else, but you will hear this one thing and you'll be responsible for it. God sent a prophet in our generation to straighten this mess out and to bring light to us to get us ready for a rapture. You can believe that or you don't have to believe that. It'll be up to you. But know this, you'll answer for it someday &gt;&gt; cuz he didn't do this in a corner. He did this worldwide, ALL OVER THE WORLD, SEVEN TIMES ROUND. In closing, I want to read you two stories. Would that be okay? for the sake of our listening a congregation also. Amen. Praise the Lord. You love him. &gt;&gt; All right. I believe this was in Durban, South Africa had 150,000 people or something like that. And he said this other missionary was saying, "Oh, that one person that he had won in 20 years, that precious jewel, that precious jewel." And if you remember, if I'm not wrong, I mean, that one Muhammad that he went over, he was carrying a certain idol or something also. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And he called him Thomas. Brother Ram said he I'm going to call you Thomas because he says, "Well, if the God Moya, the God that y'all are preaching to me, if he fails, this one won't because my daddy was being chased by a lion and he quickly set up a a a camp and got him a fire going and it protected him from the lion. So, I keep the idol." Brother Bram says, "Man, you aren't a very good hunter. You would know that that fire keeps the lion away." Amen. But he was doubting. Amen. He said, "One that one of all the years that he spent over there trying to missionary and so forth." Amen. He had been there 30 years preaching and had won one Muhammad. Brother, the Muhammad and the Hindus came from the old Mes and Persians. They don't alter. They don't change. Amen. But that real genuine Lord Jesus in action at one time he says when I [snorts] made the altar call after discernment so forth went ball ain't that right in one afternoon which I believe brother Julius I believe you'd be believe he he's way over there but 30,000 came to Christ at one time in an altar call FF Bossworth if everybody anybody ever met that saint in this modern day he says brother Bosworth yes sir I stand with that if he said I'd stand with that if I was dying this minute. And that old man stood there looking over the ground weeping. An estimated 25,000 miraculous healings taking place. And I never touched one person. Just stood there and prayed for them. Seven truckloads of all kinds of sticks and stretches and things was packed off the ground where they walked RIGHT AWAY FROM THEM. 25,000. How many remembers in Bible's TIME JESUS WOULD HEAL A MULTITUDE PERHAPS? Isn't that right? Perhaps. [screaming] AND I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT IT WAS. MAYBE ONE TIME THEY had a a multitude of 5,000. I don't know that they were all healed at the time, BUT HE WOULD HAVE SOMETIMES HEAL THEM ALL, BUT HERE NEVER RECORDED PROBABLY 25,000 healings where people just brother Brand prayed and the Holy Spirit moved over them. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. Can you imagine in the supernatural realm the angels that was touching them? Amen. Oh my. Think of it. And here you preach till you snuff your life out almost. And one will say, "Well, that's a pretty good message, I guess, but I don't really care to go back anymore." Ain't that America for you? Oh, your day has come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, your day has come &gt;&gt; over in India. I'm going to tell you a couple more stories, but Abraham says if God would reveal to that little girl sitting there that she was going to walk, he says, "I bet the devil couldn't send it every He could send every demon out of hell and that wouldn't stop it." Amen. Let me tell you something. My wife had faith. She had a revelation she's not going to die. She didn't fear cancer. THOSE DEVILS AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE HER AS LONG AS SHE'S GOT A REVELATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT ENOUGH DEVILS IN HELL. THAT WOULDN'T STOP IT. That man sitting there in a wheel wheelchair, whoever you are, it wouldn't stop him. No, there ain't nothing can stop him. God said so. That settles it. Now in Finland, a little boy, remember brother Brandham, years before it happened told everybody to re uh write it in their Bibles that a little boy and the color and things that was going to be is going to be raised from the dead. He don't know where, he don't know who, but it happened and it happened in in Finland when they were driving down the road and there was a great big accident and a little boy laying out on the road dead. Now let's continue the story there in Finland when that little boy had been laying there on the ground there dead. I've got that document pronounced dead when went and got the mother and the father before the undertaker could take him was laying there and I come down and I said that's that little boy I seen two years ago in America there stood about 500 people the mayor of the city and I said to Mistress Isaac's interpret this and she did I said if that baby doesn't raise from the dead laying there dead every bone in his body broke wound up like that throwed him out even his little feet and things sticking through his socks, his shoes off of him and everything. If that baby isn't standing on his feet in five minutes from now, I'm a false prophet and a liar. You run me out of this country. Imagine interpreting that. I'm believing that there I'm believing this was the case where those those soldiers seen it happen and even take even mus uh Russian soldiers and Finnish guys hug each other. Amen. Listen out of this cont WHY I WAS CERTAIN THAT GOD HAD SHOWED me the vision. It has to be so there's nothing that can stop it. Amen. How many knows you prayed for it and that little boy rose up? &gt;&gt; How many believes that was a great light? great light. I won't have time tonight to get into it, but the manifestation of the word of God is the light. When God manifests himself, when he manifests his love through you to somebody else, you are the light. That kindness that you show somebody, that's the light. &gt;&gt; When God heals somebody, that's the light. WHEN SOMEBODY FILLS THE HOLY GHOST, THAT'S THE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD DOES SIGNS AND WONDERS, that's the light. Amen. Send the light. Send the light. Amen. Okay. Next story. That night in India before all those people when the Rihads I guess on their pillows and the holy men sitting around sitting all around. Now remember the day before that this meeting took place all the different religions of India they took them to TOOK BROTHER BRANDHAM THROUGH THEIR temples and showed them all their all of their history and how many millions and millions how they're the greatest and how Christianity is one of the least. just kind of mocking Christianity and how great they were and everything. But Brandham listened to it and went all that. He says, "But come out tomorrow and come out to the meetings." And there they were in the meeting sitting around. And I had been in the temple of the seeks and the James that day and they made fun of Christianity. They said, "The very idea of Christ dying when they won't even kill a flea or mop a floor as they go to keep from stepping uh stepping or or or an ant." They believe in reincarnation. think it might be some of their relatives. How could you preach to them the blood sacrifice? I said, "Let God speak. That's God. Some of us has got to be some of us got to be wrong." And I picked up the Quran in one hand and the Bible in the other and I said, "Something's wrong somewhere." Can you imagine BEFORE 500,000? I BELIEVE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG SOMEWHERE. LORD HELP US. HOW MANY KNOW THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME ELIJAH'S SPIRIT ON MOUNT uh Mount Carmel, I believe it is, THOSE 400 PROPHETS IN THE DAYS OF THE BIBLE SAYS, "IF YOUR GOD IS GOD, LET HIM PROVE IT. &gt;&gt; LET HIM COME FORTH. BRING YOUR SACRIFICE." AMEN. THEY BROUGHT THEIR SACRIFICE. AMEN. And man, they tried to get the FIRE GOING. TRIED TO BURN. IT WOULDN'T START. YOU TALK ABOUT A NON-STARTER. IT WAS A NON-STARTER. BUT AFTERWARDS, ELIJAH SAID, "BRING, BRING ME NOW SOMETHING. I WANT YOU TO DOUSE IT. DOUSE IT AGAIN. DOUSE IT AGAIN." AMEN. UNTIL IT'S FLOODED. &gt;&gt; WOO. That's what BROTHER BRANDON WAS THERE. AMEN. THE ELIJAH SPIRIT SAID, "NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE." HE WAS BRINGING A CHALLENGE. HE WAS OPENING UP THE EYES OF THE WORLD. AND REVELATIONS 18, THE ANGEL THAT CAME, HIS GLORY LIGHTENED [screaming] THE WHOLE EARTH. AREN'T YOU GLAD TO BE A PART OF THAT LIGHT? IT'S WORTH EVERY TIME, EVERY EFFORT, EVERY SACRIFICE WE MADE TO BE A PART OF THAT LIGHT. &gt;&gt; Shall be light in the evening time. &gt;&gt; Amen. SOMETHING'S WRONG SOMEWHERE. LET GOD that's real speak. Hallelujah. Brother says, "About that time, they brought a blind man up there and I says, I cannot heal the man." Of course not. I said, "His name is spelled and he spells out the letters like that." That's right. I said he's a beggar. His wife's the little thin woman. He's got boys. One of them six and the other one's eight. Correct. Standing out there that mo that anoint underneath that anointing them re r a j ah rahas sitting out there them holy men said he's reading their mind. I thought I thought oh them hypocrites. Then I looked back and I thought, "Oh, God, if you'll just do something." And I looked back and here's a vision. And there he stood looking around in the vision. And brother, now now let something happen. AND I SAID, "I CHALLENGE EVERY MOHAMAD AND PRIEST in here, EVERY PRIEST OF BUDDHA, seek James THAT MADE FUN OF CHRISTIANITY, COME HERE AND GIVE HIM HIS SIDE." I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT REMINDS ME OF CHICAGO WHEN THEY HAD A TRAP SET FOR HIM. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? HE SAYS, "ANY ONE OF YOU PREACHERS THAT WANT TO WANT TO CHALLENGE ME ON THE WATER BAPTISM AND THE GODHEAD, COME UP HERE AND STAND BY MY SIDE." CUZ THE angel had told him, "I'll be by your right side. I'll be by your side." Challenged them. And what did they do? They were smarter than he thought. They kept their mouth closed and didn't come. Amen. But here he is. Here he is challenging them. That's another video I want to see when they get over there. Don't you? Amen. I want to do some scrolling when I go over there. David, David and Goliath, SAMSON, SAM. I WANT TO SEE THAT. [screaming] Just think ABOUT HOW MANY KNOWS FAITH COMES BY HEARING. HEARING WHAT? HEARING THOSE MAKES YOU BELIEVE GOD IS HERE. HOW MANY BELIEVE GOD IS HERE TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; HIS PRESENCE IS HERE. [applause] Thank you, Jesus. Anything's possible. Oh yeah. I'm going to have the time of my life. When the time of my life is over, we're going to get carried away. After we get carried away, well, we don't know why. We become a little shy. When we get around, a whole lot of people are up in the pulpit. Amen. Okay. I challenge every Muhammad or priest. See, James, you made fun of Christianity. Come here and give him a sight. Surely the God that created him. If you And he said, I'll serve the God that gives me my sight. [laughter] I'll serve the God that gives me my sight. I said, oh, of course you say he's wrong. He's a not sun worship. Sure. He's worshiping the creator instead of the create creation instead of creator. And I said, "What would your James do? You just proc the light and make him a Jane. What would you Muhammadas do?" The same thing. What would you Buy? We got the same thing in America. Amen. Oh, let me just say what comes to mind. How many knows the gospel don't come in word only but in power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. That is the true light. The power and the demonstration of it. I said all the Methodists that like in America he wants to make everybody Baptist and Pentecostals and everybody else. But I said surely the God that made him hallelujah. The God that made him ought to do something about it. Well, you think I would have said that by by no means would I have said that if I hadn't seen that vision. Amen. I knowed where what was going to happen then and the devil couldn't do nothing about it then. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh, how many glad that the message that we follow, it's the evening time light when he was in Germany and other places. Amen. And he was having a tent and THE WITCH DOCTORS ACTUALLY CALLED UP A STORM. AMEN. AND IT WAS ABOUT TO rip the tent away. But he spoke in the name OF THE LORD. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? AND GOD BROUGHT IT BACK. THERE WASN'T ENOUGH DEVILS IN HELL TO STOP THIS LIGHT FROM SHINING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OKAY. Devil couldn't do nothing then. If he'd showed a vision that if he would if he would show a vision that George Washington was going to rise from the dead in the morning, I'd invite the whole world and stand and watch it done. &gt;&gt; Amen. What you would have done with God yesterday, you would have done it today. I believe every one of us would stand by the side of the grave and we'd be saying, "Yeah, we it's going to happen. We believe it. I believe it. It's going to happen." We wouldn't doubt, would we? No, sir. We wouldn't be called mental telepathy. And I said, "Now, you Muhammadans that say you're the predominant religion, come give him his sight and I'll be your disciple." Wow. IMAGINE THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYING he's going to put Christianity down. Put everything down. That's what he said. And I'll come follow your religion. It's a very, very good challenge. Because on the flip side, ain't that right? There's a flip side to it. I'll be your disciple. You holy man. Come give him his sight. tens time tens of thousands times thousands laying in them big fields there. There set the mayor of the city. Got his name and address if you want to write him and ask him. And they said, "Why?" I I said, "You're awful still crowd." [laughter] He was nice. He was nice. Elijah in the Old Testament wasn't so nice. HE SAID, "WHERE'S YOUR GOD AT? Maybe he's on a vacation. Maybe he's asleep and you need to wake him up. But Brandon, all he says, he says, "You're quiet." He was nice on him. What's the matter with you? You were telling me today how little creity was and how great your religion WAS. I SAYS, "LOOK AT YOU PEOPLE OUT THERE. LOOK AT YOUR PRIEST. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THEM? THEY CALLED ME A FANATIC." Telling the crowd that their priests and their pastors called him a fanatic. a American soapbox salesman selling religion like it was on a soap box because I shook my arms when the Holy Ghost was on me. I don't know, maybe it was that way. That's the way I shake my arms. I don't know how Brother Ram shook his, but sometimes the Holy Ghost just make you shake your arms, kick your feet, stomp the Holy Ghost stomp. I hope everybody with that. Brother Aram shaking his hand just because he shook his hands. Amen. They had a problem. Now notice, so he says, "SO BOX SALESMAN, LET THEM COME." Now notice, and I said, "LET THEM COME FORTH then and give this man his sight." Hallelujah. Watching that vision, I says, "Why don't you come?" "It's because you can't. &gt;&gt; It's because you can't." And he said, "Neither can I. But the God of heaven, &gt;&gt; I like the way he addresses that. But the God of heaven, the one that made the moon, the stars, the earth, and everything else in it, he says, "Who raised up his son, Christ Jesus, that gave me the vision just now that I saw that man standing there with his sight. I saw him in a vision. If he doesn't give him his sight, then I'm a false prophet. you run me out of India. If he does give him his sight, HOW MANY OF YOU Muhamadans and Buddhists and all of YOU WILL RECEIVE CHRIST as your savior? Let me tell you something people listening tonight. If you really believe this story that God did this, vindicated this prophet, how many believe you should believe? You should believe. Amen. And you should give your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ. If he does give him his heart, how many will you receive Christ? Just black hands as far as you could see. Said, "Bring him here." I put my arms around him. I said, "Lord Jesus, no more than that." Wow. Lord Jesus, no more than that. And I said, he began hollering something and hollering like that. He could see as good as I could run and grab the mayor of the city running up AND DOWN LIKE THAT. WHAT WAS IT? IT'S THE SAME GOD. GOD'S WORD IS JUST AS real tonight as he ever was. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. God is just the same as he ever was. JESUS, THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. That was just one of so many thousands. But that was one of the greater events where God Almighty challenged the Buddha. Jesus Christ challenged him through his prophet used him to bring light to them. 30,000 raw heathens in Africa. I don't know how many in India that gave their lives to the Lord at one time. I don't know about you, but when I heard the message, something clicked. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Something clicked. If you're an eagle and you hear that eagle cry, you hear that truth, there's something that clicks. Anybody listens, I ask, does something click? Is there something in your heart that says, "I believe that's the truth. Did God really do something?" You pursue that. You follow that with all of your heart. God bless you. Stand tonight. Amen. Let's bow our heads and pray. Lord Jesus, we come before you tonight trusting Lord Jesus that Father that you will have spoken to one of your children's hearts. Lord, maybe many. But Father, I pray God that as we walk in this beautiful light, it's a wonderful light, Lord. It's not dismal anymore. It's not cloudy. It's not fl foggy anymore. It's clear. We don't have to guess at it anymore. We don't have to wonder about it anymore. It's according to what Paul preached. And it's vindicated BY YOU YOURSELF COMING down and proving it's true by many signs and wonders that followed. And Lord, we ask God that you would take everybody both in here in this congregation right now, anybody listening, and help us, God, as we raise our hands, say, "Lord, I want a closer walk with you. Lord, help me to be a greater light in my community, in my neighborhood, to my wife, to my husband, to my children, to my grandchildren, to those that I work with. Lord, help us to be a greater light. Bless every heart, every hand tonight, Lord. Make us more like you. Draw us closer to you, Lord. [snorts] And we'll give you all the glory, the honor, and the praise in Jesus Christ's name. Oh, we'll walk in the light. Such a [singing] beautiful light. And walk [singing] where the do drops of mercy are bright and all around [singing] us. God bless you, brother Ben. [music] And by night, Jesus, [singing] the light of the world. We'll walk in the light. Oh, we'll walk in the light. [singing] Such [music] a beautiful light. Come where the [singing] dew drops of mercy are bright. Shine all around us by day and by [singing] night. Jesus the light of the world. Amen. How many enjoyed the message tonight? Let's just give the Lord a hand clap of praise. [applause and music] It ought to do something for us when we hear about the goodness of God and all that he does for us and raising the dead and healing the sick and creating. You know, you you hear that story, Brother Brandham. Uh well, they it's been told about brother Brandham. He said he created the eyeballs of that little girl. He not only created those eyeballs, but he looked down, the story goes, and he says, "Sweetheart, what color eyes would you like?" And she said, 'I heard blue is pretty. Hallelujah. That's the kind of God we serve. [music] Let's say before we go, let's sing Oh, I want to see him as I journey through the land, singing as [singing] I go, pointing souls to [music] Calvary, to the [singing] crimson flow. Many arrows pierce [music and singing] my soul from withoutin. But [music] my Lord [singing] leads me on and through him I must [music] win. Oh I want to see [singing] him. Look upon his face there to sing [singing and music] forever of his saving grace. And on the streets of gloryy, let me lift my voice. [singing] [music] Cares all past home at last. Ever to rejoice [singing] [music] when before me billows rise from the mighty [singing and music] deep. Then my Lord directs my bark. He does safely [singing and music] keep and he leads me gently on through [music] this world below. And he's a real friend to me. And oh, I love him [singing] so. And oh, I want to see him. [singing and music] Look upon his face. Dare to sing [singing] forever of his saving grace. On the streets of gloryy. [singing and music] Let me lift my voice. Cares all past. [music] Home at last. [singing] Ever to rejoice. Hallelujah. I tell you, we're going to go ahead and dismiss. It's getting late tonight, but [music] the preaching of the word is worth the time spent. a lot of other places we could spend time, but no better time than right here. So, if I just want to say if anybody has a need knowing the storm's coming in, if you know anybody in need, maybe they need groceries or or preparing for maybe they need gas, they you're not going to be able to probably get out if we get what they say, please let Brother Steve and Brother David know so that [music] they can we can enter the channels to make sure everybody's taken care of. All right, so God bless you as you dismiss. Let's sing it as we go. Oh, I want to [singing and music] see him look upon his face there to sing [music and singing] forever of his saving grace. On the [singing] streets of glory, [music] your
