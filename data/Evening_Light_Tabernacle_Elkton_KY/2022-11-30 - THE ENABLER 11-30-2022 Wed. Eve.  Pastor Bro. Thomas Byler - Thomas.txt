that's represented tonight in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord turn your bibles if you will to the first chapter of or the first book of Timothy Timothy 1 Amy and I have quite a few scriptures and so I hope that I can kind of keep it together here I have like to go back over them a little bit because when you have quite a bit it's easy to get mixed up amen so praise the Lord [Music] amen First Timothy one and we'll read verse 12. and I thank Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a prosecute persecutor an injury injurious but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly and in unbelief and the grace of our Lord was exceeding the Abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus amen now I want to turn the numbers the 13th chapter and we want to read uh the report of the 12 Spies actually this is the report of Defense spies after coming back from spying out the land for 40 days amen we know that the Lord send them back out into the Wilderness for 40 years because of their unbelief each year was for one day that they were out there because of their bad report and verse 27 of chapter 13 of numbers and they told him and said we came unto the land where their thou as send us send us to us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of Enoch there the amalekites dwelled in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and Caleb Still the people before Moses said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we are and they brought an evil brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw are so in it are men of great stature and there we saw the Giants the son of Enoch which come of the Giants and we were in our own side as Grasshoppers and so we're we were in their side amen may God had his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning at this evening this evening amen over in chapter 14 and verse 36 it says and the man which Moses sent to search to land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him bringing up his land upon the land even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the Lord before the Lord but Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of Jeth and then which were of the men that were in search the land lived still amen so we see the outcome of those who brought up an evil report amen it just comes to me now as I think about how that the Bible tells and says that he that believeth not is condemned already isn't that right so over in the New Testament for those who do not believe amen perhaps don't believe what God has said death is pronounced upon him already isn't it even as these men who brought up an evil report and I think they're that the big problem was with verse 33 it says that we were now notice there's two two things here two places he says and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers amen amen uh you know it brings it down home that a lot of times you are what you think you are you know life has a lot to do with how you look at yourself is that right how look how you how do you look at yourself amen uh you know and it says that we as we were also in their sight you know what they looked at us you know uh it doesn't really matter so much but it's matters of how they look at themselves they looked at themselves completely wrong didn't they because it wasn't about them in the first place isn't that right they should have looked at the god that they were serving because you know David he looked one time and you know I'm sure that Goliath looked at David as a a dog he's as himself he says am I a dog that you sent this little weakling you know he looked at David as just a weakling uh nothing but David how many knows David he was a little fitty shrimp of a fella but he didn't look at himself as a weakling you know because he knew that it wasn't about David but it was about the God that was with him so tonight's uh I want to title this the enabler the enabler amen the one that makes things possible amen you've heard the saying uh you know uh no can do how many has ever heard that you know somebody wants to you know want something from you or whatever he says no can do you know and that's the way in the attitude that the Israel had no can do we can't do it right I don't know about you but when I want a project I know when I want something done I like for somebody to tell me can do yeah no problem we can do it amen and so that's what we're going to focus on tonight with the help of the Lord for a little while amen and uh so you know because amen here this this was of course looking at the Old Testament now how many knows that as brother bam said that the Old Testament was a reflection or a shadow of the New Testament and as they looked and Scattered out so to speak in spite out the land they found out that it was a good land it was a really good thing I mean those that's a type of the Holy Ghost brother bam said amen the Holy Ghost is a good thing Christ is a good thing you know but there's some Giants in the land there's some things that we Face some time that oh it just looks like we're grasshoppers compared to what the problem is you know but how many knows you can never take the wrong attitude towards that problem amen and no matter how big it looks no matter how much how impossible it might seem amen the second that you think that you can't do it well then that's when you can't do it amen and it's not always easy amen and so but they but you got to keep you got to look at it in the right aspect in the right way praise be to God so I like this so um you know but you know there's only one thing that we one one thing about it is that in order to do anything first of all we realize that we in ourselves and we hear this a lot that we in ourselves we can't do it how many knows that we can't do it you can't do a whole lot by yourself you know you can't really do anything by yourself but even Jesus talked about that he was the vine that we're the branches he says he didn't abideth and me and I and him the same bringeth forth much fruit he says for without me ye can do nothing you can do nothing without Christ so I mean it's a secret to being a person that can't do it is somebody that is in Christ amen brother bam says some of you people walking along and saying well I just can't quit drinking and I just can't quit this the Holy Ghost comes to live in you to make all these camps get away from you how many knows my goodness he says you know you got to get away amen you know there's a can of the Holy Ghost is a canner I asked Micah today I said you know I don't know for sure if there's even a word amen enabler enabler I guess that's a word that's as well if it's my English but a brand I'm used by English too and it talked about canners and canters I don't know if there's a words either but I understand what he's saying and I guess that's what's important right but to get all these kids away from us that's right better man in the series of what is the Holy Ghost he was preaching the Holy Ghost series and what was the Holy Ghost given for the Bible says the Holy Ghost comes to live in you to make all these can't get away from you amen make you women quit cutting your hair make you men and quit wearing these shorts and slacks no excuses presidents no excuses amen um it would make the women come to hair and make them wearing shorts and slacks he says and make them quit tattling oh yeah hey man that's what it's for to make you live a holy life the holy ghost that will follow the instructions of the Bible every time amen Raymond will say well it's just too hot I've got the worries he's gives me a headache if I don't let if I let my hair grow but there's no excuses with the Holy Ghost it's there to make it so amen it'll follow the word just exactly that's what the Holy Ghost is to do to make you man turn your head from them half naked women and quit lusting after them that's right it's to make you quit smoking and drinking and wanna be a big shot it'll make take that all out of you it'll humble you when you do when you do that that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's for a holy life make you quit gossiping make it quit playing cards shooting craps and all these other things that you do around the corner it'll make you quick you're carrying on the way that you're doing living untrue to your wife that's what it'll make you quit you want to marry somebody else's wife that's exactly right that's what it is make you live a holy life that's why the holy ghost power is for it'll make you set your affections and things above where Christ sitteth at the right of hand of God it'll put in the mind of Christ in you amen amen praise the Lord when I got to think about that and if it's just come to me amen I would guess it was four o'clock in the morning and I was just meditating on the Lord woke up and and this this little quote came where another man have got to talk about the cancer and the canner and I said Canon Cantor and I remembered he talked about you know you get the Holy Ghost that can or that cancer get away from you that canner will come in praise be to God I got to thinking about the scripture like Paul says I can do all things I mean I can do all of it I know how it is what it's like to be a base I know what it's like to have much I know what it is like to have suffering and all these other things but Paul he was a person that believed that he could do oh my God oh don't you just love it amen Philippians I want to turn to that scripture I'm gonna slow down just a little bit if that's all right Paul says you know I speak in respect of want and for I have learned and whatsoever State I am there with to be content he's all right no matter what state he's in last chapter of Philippians 4 and verse 12. I know both know how to be a base and I know how to abound everywhere in all things I am instructed both to be full or to be hungry both the bound are to suffer need oh my we could add a whole lot more in there he knows what it's like to be Shipwrecked he knows what it's like to be stoned he knows what he's like to be schwepped and left for dead he knows how to suffer a need but he says I can't do all things through Christ which strengthens me amen oh my how many knows what it's it's just a whole different world there's two worlds that you live in you live inside of Christ or you live outside of Christ how many knows that you're either hid away in Christ or you're outside of Christ Jesus made it plain I'm the mind you're the branches if you don't bring forth fruit you're cut off if you cut off your outside and you withered you get outside of Christ you'll wither away amen praise be to God but in Christ it's a different story all things are possible amen the Holy Ghost comes to make all these things happen you say well I just can't do it oh I just can't do it sure you can but the Holy Ghost came for that purpose so that you could amen how many believe that Paul says I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me amen let's go to another one how about Ephesians 3 and 20. Ephesians 3 and verse 20 it says now unto him that is able amen he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in US I like that praise be God I was just you know I I just drive down the road and I got to thinking about the Lord and I got to thinking you know it's so it's something now that we have God on board now we love God and how we serve God we don't realize the power that is that our disposable the power that God has that basically is untouched yet by us a lot of times there's no telling what can God can do in your life amen and I thought about that you know I'm Tim the disabled he is able to do exceeding the abundance above all that we can ask oh my I like that what's the other word that we can ask or say it out loud think amen I like to stretch these little gray matters up in here a little bit come on now believe a little more think about it a little more realizing you've got a God that's not just a god of History amen how many believe God can change your situation you know sometimes the devil will try to tell us you know we can't change we can't change huh and we know preachers tell us you can't change your husband you can't we can't change each other you can't change yourself I'll give you and stop there think of where you'd be how horrible would it be to think that you can't change but I'm here to tell you this is what this is all about it's all about change Paul said that we look into the mirror of his word and we change from glory to glory but a man says that you can't come in those double doors and stay the same you'll either go out better or you'll go out worse what would be like that just to go out of history and that's the problem is people don't believe that God is here today amen so they say that oh the Holy Ghost was just for the Old Testament or for the apostles and so forth amen the Bible says that they had to have a form of godliness but they would deny the power of it hey man what the power to change us can I tell you something else come to my mind last week I don't know who we are it's just like give me my apparently we don't know who we are yet foreign what is it the reason I come to that conclusion because of the rest of the quote that President Brown said he says when she realizes who she is [Music] the right should take place so we're still here so apparently we don't know who we are quite yet but we're gonna figure it out aren't we we're gonna figure it out that I've been better Ted talk about it because I kind of contemplated it he was talking about the whole mystery it's about you I'm like what that's a big word because I don't like always thinking about myself let's think about him a little shall we but the Bible clearly says great is the victory of Christ which is Christ The Mystery of God that it is Christ in you the hope of glory that's what the Bible said even by the way I'm talking about the whole mystery is the revelation of you Christ in you the bad thing that you and I hope that I've kind of wrote down somewhere but the bad thing that you and I can have is to know that the living Christ is in you every single day and you are seeing him manifested through [Music] you that God could take these vile frail uh uh shortcoming bodies and vessels and so forth that we got to repent all the time and everything but he could steal and happiness in such a way that he would fulfill his word and complete his mission here through you and I am that right amen wow how am I yeah David didn't have a problem he says I will take your head off amen because I don't come to you with a sword and a shield I don't come to you with my ability but I come to you because I know the god that's in heaven let me just skip to page three I usually have one page but I've got about three this time the only reason the only reason that you can't do whatever it is that you need to do to live according to the Bible is why why is it well I've had the prophet say that he'd have harlots and prostitutes to come get their healing we're saying so huh well let me just give you a scriptural Lance how many lack of scriptural answer because you remember the epileptic child that their parents brought to the disciples and they just couldn't cast him out and remember to ask why couldn't we do it and what was the first direct answer that Jesus said he said because of your faith Hallelujah let me tell you so I believe that's where we like if we like anywhere is because of our faith in God because Bible says all things are possible anything's possible if you can believe nonetheless Bible says that with you nothing shall be impossible you can do anything if you have the Faith Lord there's nothing impossible oh Hallelujah think about it when Joshua needed more time I mean we're talking about massive things we're talking about great things like stopping the universe so to speak stopping the sun stop in the moon and we've got a little problems with taking care of our family our home and everything else huh you can't even do some of those little things they can't even treat your neighbor right you can't even treat your wife right or your husband right folks it's time to start with a small thing but it does no limit things are possible so don't give me excuses that's what the prophet said Oh my he was getting the owner he pinched on people a little bit I want to hurt you but I've told you I'm here to in the deepest of sincerity and I keep to keep from pinching you once in a while I just jump off the line somewhere else say something a little bit different staying there and make it in such a way it won't pinch too hard but I'm here to tell you something the Bible says it is wrong for a woman to cut her hair and you say you've got the Holy Ghost and cut your hair now that's just one illustration of whatever it is that you're having a problem with tonight are you with me huh may not be here but something whatever it is is contrary to the word you said oh you know okay and you can only want to go to church I don't feel like going to church you better get a different feeling in your heart isn't that right or whatever it might be wrong for it to do her hair and you say you got the Holy Ghost I wonder if you have and I don't get mad if you do it shows that you're another Mark against you why because the Bible said for a woman not to cut her hair isn't that right the Bible says it's wrong for a woman to put a garment that pertains to a man and you wear those little overalls or whatever it is you've grown women I guess a little girl or a little baby or whatever to play with the little boys and things but look when you're a grown woman 15 16 18 years old no grandma on off the road the opposits an Abomination it's not a God to wear another thing and you wear them anymore and you say you got the Holy Ghost I wonder sometimes that Holy Ghost will follow God's word to the letter and the preaching behind the pope will they got Grace enough to preach it I doubt he's got it he hit us all Tony that's right Glory now I got wrote down here but you know most people make an excuse you know for themselves and say well it was for some other age let me tell you something people got to form the godliness but they deny the power they're us when God does something he doesn't complete work how many that's what God's singing he's doing a complete work Lord keep changing me help me to go out here for better person don't want to come in let me be equipped I mean those that God equips his people but if I'm talking about Moses he completely when God sends a man to do anything he completely equips him with everything he has made of Hallelujah and when God equips a man he equips him with his own material I like that don't you it's not by our might it's not by our power but it's by his spirit says the Lord that's the way you learned it he says he's talking about amen that God that's how God equips his army is he fills them with his spirit we got all that like both here and out there that you need more of the Holy Ghost you need more Christ and a lot of these problems you wouldn't have anymore because the Holy Ghost wouldn't do it the Holy Ghost is sensitive about everything that you do amen but it's only by faith I wanted to pull that out and amen because that's where the problem is is the faith level amen because even that man that had that child and brought to him and so forth he says if thou can't believe all things are possible he says Lord I believe Lord help them an unbelief huh but that's what Jesus pointed to him when the disciples came up to something that they couldn't overcome it was your faith level is what the problem is amen praise the Lord Joshua 23 1-6 it talks about he says you know uh let's just go there let's just go to Joshua let's read this one be thee therefore very courageous to keep all to do that is written in the book of the law this is 23 and verse 6. that you turned on a side they're from to the right hand or to the left that ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor by yourselves unto them but cleave unto the Lord your God as you have done unto this day for the Lord has driven out before you the great Nations and strong you great Nations this is a strong but as for you no man has been able to stand before you all your days how many noses that's what he told even Josh at the beginning you don't focus on God give him a night they meditate day and night he says and there's no man that'll stand in front of you Billy Paul said about his dad you know the greatest Miracle about his dad is how they can control every situation I wonder if that was for God's people for God's Prophet I wonder if that ain't for you and I tonight that if you stay in Christ and focus the way you are that there will nothing stand in your way nothing will stumble you nothing will bring you down oh I don't know about you but I believe it's for you and for me I believe it's for me amen now notice stand before you unto this day one man of you shall chase a thousand when God is with you it don't matter how many is against you how many knows that Samson is an example David's an example Moses an example if God before us who can be against us if God is for you who can be against you doesn't that make you feel good man doesn't that make you just want to jump up now a little bit when I look at these problems of good this the more I got the looking at it I realized why the prophet of God says we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth you ought to be the happiest people in the world if truly you're buried in Christ you ain't got to worry in the world not even death pastors can scare you think's yours Paul said life death these presence things to come it all belongs see because Jesus paid for it on Calvary every enemy is under your feet amen praise be to God that's right let's talk about this ability how many believe we when we when God's with you you're able the enabler you know it's I just got the thought of thinking about that word able and not able you know to not have an ability is to be helpless it's like to being down in a big old hole No Way Out way down there no way out at all how many knows that's the way the human race is that's the way every person that's born of a woman is you're born down in a hole No Way Out but somebody throws your rope down there right throws you a rope down there and now all of a sudden now you're what able to get out of there gives you the ability amen now you what can instead of can't can't is not really in a Christian's vocabulary is it no never use the word can't can't unless of course it's for the right reason like you can't do things that the devil wants you I can't do that I can't do that no but as far as your possibility there's no can't because why is there no can't this scripture here takes away all the can'ts nothing shall be impossible for you so don't give me no chance well I just can't not just can't I can't sure you can but there's one that can that's him when he comes in there you can amen praise be to God Paul says I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me now I want to go just for a minute I'm going to talk about the devil side you can't side huh the devil's the one that is has an inability he's not able when it comes to fighting Christians or getting you he's not able he has the word he has to use the word many times I tried but I couldn't I couldn't how many times the Devils used that down through history I couldn't I failed I failed I couldn't amen over in Romans eight because the Bible says one place about the devil in his weapons he says no weapon formed against thee shall prosper so no matter what the devil throws Against The Real Son of God daughter of God that's in Christ now huh that's in Christ no weapon formed against you is able to make it can't stand can't do it Paul said it this way he was so convinced that the devil could never get to him that he wrote in Romans 8 and verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation distress or persecution I mean that's what the devil does persecute or famine our nakedness or Peril or sword all fails right you can't for it is as it is written for thy sake we are killed all day long we are counted as sheep as the slaughter but no in all these things we are more than conquerors more than able right through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers amen nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus nothing can separate us from his love amen aren't you glad for that thank you there's another scripture just comes to mind when I looked up that Abel word running it down he says all that the father has given me will come to me amen and he talks about and being in the father's hand and he says no man is able to pluck him out of my hand no man is able nothing is going to be able to pluck it out talk about ability and not ability no devil can ever pluck you out of his hand if he gets a hold of you foreign keep your seats because this applies to you look at all the times he's tried and look at where you are still today look at all the times he's tried to pluck you out of his hand you away I'm gonna say something I don't mean to pinch too hard but I'm here to tell you that I don't hardly know any weapons that the devil hasn't used against me huh many many weapons this church a lot of y'all any weapons is many weapons tried in many ways this brings me to another scripture if I can just read it 4 and 21 that's not the one I'm looking for 8 35 nope all right all right let me just look at this 835 . here it is 14 Romans 14 and 4. who art thou that just just another man's servant amen to his own Master he standeth or falleth in other words we should be very careful about judging each other you know how quick it is well he's up the devil well he ain't of God or look at what he's doing you know and all these others quickly that just condemn somebody and so forth when you're trying to be a Christian Paul says be careful who are not a judge is another man's servant to his own Master he standeth or follow up yea he shall be holding up for God is able to make him the stand amen how many knows don't try to knock somebody else down trust me if God don't hold him he's gonna fall amen but you're sure not going to be the one that causes him to fall or makes him fall because God is able to hold him up but if the devil wouldn't he like to do that to every one of us he wants every one of us to fall amen sure he does amen First Timothy 1 and 12 he says unto him that is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day is that right all right I want to do another little series before I bring it to a close Ephesians 6. ability let's talk about ability because that's what we're talking about when we're talking about enabling to be able ability very familiar scriptures but I was surprised at how many times he talks about it Paul in Ephesians 6 and verse 10 finally my brethren amen that's what I want to double shout out to us tonight everyone listening here at the end time in this horrible age that we're living in May this apply to every one of us finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand amen Against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers I like what brother Phil brought to you tonight if you can stop him right here when he comes into your mind you'll you've stopped him don't never let him come in here and then drop down in here because James talk about when Temptation comes in you know and when it has conceived it brings forth sin it's got to be conceived first it has to be accepted you've got to think about it amen against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places War for take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand how many needs ability tonight see God help me I need ability I don't need excuses I need ability to stand in the Evil Dead and having not all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able I like that all these shall be able I like that you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked praise be to God and take the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching guarantee with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen wow Lord increase my faith that's the only reason that you're not able if you don't have the faith if you don't believe the only reason amen all right let's go to one more scripture here in Jude I like this thank you he says verse 24 now unto him that is able remember one place he says you know he that hath begun a good work he's also able to perform it it's not about you performing it it's about him performing it in and through you isn't that a message we've heard much but yet now notice that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy amen to him that is able to keep you from falling I mean those that's all by the Holy Spirit it's all just the Holy Spirit with God and with the holy spirit all things are possible With God all things are possible now like what he says you know he says when God equips a person he equips his that person with his material I believe his material is his spirit amen he is able Abraham said you know he uh staggered not at the promise of God through I believe was but was strong through you know believing that he who had promised that was able to perform it I mean I believe we're to rely on God to perform it in your life my life God is doing a work amen hey well I just don't have no joy in my life but what was wrong with you amen you can have toy you can have fullness of joy you're gonna have peace that passes understanding unspeakable and full of Glory amen but I also thought about this whether one thing better than sisters and that is that we got to continue to focus more on the Lord you still have too much focus on the things of this world I mean and that's why we're weak in faith a lot of times our prayer life lacks our fellowship not love how the holy spirit's been speaking to us about our fellowship Amen brother Tommy even is talking about you know when he come first stop talking about God wants fellowship with us he wants to Fellowship what a fellowship what a joy divine leaning on the Everlasting Arms oh my praise be to God musicians if you'll come stand with me tonight I had to serve a god that is able to have a holy spirit in you that is able amen with Joshua with stopping the son Jesus says if thou can't believe you'll say to this mountain be moved into deceived thou doubts not it'll be done you just get rid of all the doubt Lord get rid of the doubt I'm wondering how many tonight would say you know I've still got too much doubt too many things that caused me to doubt Lord take that away and give me more Faith Lord to believe amen Lord Jesus do you see all the hands all over the building tonight Lord my heart's desires God help me father that my my affections would be more on the things above and not so much on the things beneath because when we have the Holy Spirit that's where our focus is more Lord but we're living in laodicea and we have all these cares sometimes these cares drowned out the Holy Spirit it drowns out the faith that we need to live above some of these Hang-Ups and these these uh things that the prophet of God talked about these little things that hang on to us and Lord we ask God did you give us more faith than that law draw us closer to you Lord and build our faith Lord to believe that all things are possible give us the ability overcome Lord all of our habits and all the things that shouldn't be there Lord for we know that the Holy Spirit wants to total line as your Prophet said you set the mark and we tow it we come up to it Lord Jesus that's what we want father we want to be pleasing to you in everything we do father amen we ask these blessings and favors now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen Donna do you have that song ready for us I mean I like this there's I think there's two songs he is able he is able I know my
