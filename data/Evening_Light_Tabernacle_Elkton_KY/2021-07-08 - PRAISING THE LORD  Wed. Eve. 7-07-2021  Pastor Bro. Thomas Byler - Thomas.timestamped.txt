[40:58] i said all right amen and we want to
[41:02] title this this evening
[41:03] just this phrase called praise ye the
[41:06] lord
[41:07] praise ye the lord amen amen
[41:12] because god is good how many knows god
[41:13] is good
[41:15] amen he truly is so we'll start with the
[41:19] lepers over in the book of luke if you
[41:22] will turn with it
[41:23] with me to the book of luke the 17th
[41:26] chapter
[41:28] and i do want to read quite a few few
[41:30] scriptures this evening
[41:32] amen do quite a bit of reading
[41:35] amen
[41:38] luke 17.
[41:46] and we'll begin with verse 12. and as he
[41:48] entered into a certain village there met
[41:50] him ten men
[41:52] that were lepers which stood afar off
[41:54] and they lifted up their voices and said
[41:56] jesus master
[41:57] have mercy on us and when he saw them he
[42:00] said unto them go show yourselves unto
[42:02] the priests
[42:03] and it came to pass that as they went
[42:05] they were cleansed
[42:06] and one of them when he saw that he was
[42:08] healed turned back
[42:10] and with a loud voice glorified god
[42:13] and fell down on his face at his feet
[42:17] giving him thanks and he was
[42:20] a samaritan and jesus answering said
[42:23] were there not ten cleanse but where are
[42:25] the nine
[42:27] there are not found that return to give
[42:29] glory to god save this stranger
[42:32] and he said unto him arise go thy way
[42:35] that faith has made thee whole i want to
[42:38] go to second timothy second timothy
[42:40] the third chapter i don't know why my
[42:43] voice wants to be a little hoarse
[42:44] tonight
[42:47] but it seems to want to second timothy 3
[42:51] and verse 1.
[42:59] one and two this know also that in the
[43:02] last days
[43:03] parallels time shall come for men shall
[43:06] be lovers of their own selves
[43:07] covetous boasters proud
[43:10] blasphemers disobedient appearance
[43:13] unthankful
[43:15] and unholy amen and the main key word
[43:18] that i wanted to pull out of there was
[43:20] unthankful amen god bless you you can be
[43:23] seated
[43:24] may god add his blessings to the reading
[43:25] of the word
[43:30] amen we look at first of all the story
[43:33] of the lepers
[43:34] there was 10 lepers and from what i
[43:37] understand all cleansed that right
[43:41] there was ten of them as far as i know
[43:43] they were all cleansed
[43:44] and we know that leprosy is something
[43:46] that's incurable
[43:48] it's a type of sin isn't that it's a
[43:50] type of sin
[43:51] uh leprosy is something that just can't
[43:53] be cured and so
[43:55] these different men i guess it was these
[43:58] lepers
[43:59] doesn't say whether it was men and women
[44:00] but uh these lepers they
[44:03] were cleansed of their leprosy and only
[44:06] one
[44:07] had something special in him didn't he
[44:12] he had appreciation he had
[44:15] thankfulness amen
[44:18] amen the rest of them i don't know
[44:21] it's kind of hard to imagine where they
[44:23] were brother glenn where were they at
[44:25] i mean what would you do if a man told
[44:28] you
[44:28] i'll tell you what just go and show
[44:30] yourselves to the priest
[44:32] and as you did what he said all of a
[44:34] sudden your leprosy
[44:35] left you all right you were cleaned
[44:38] and then you went on about your way and
[44:41] oh man just lift your life
[44:46] huh not a whole lot of
[44:49] natural affection there is it not a
[44:52] whole lot of
[44:53] thought not a whole lot of feeling there
[44:55] amen
[44:56] that's what it was with them and it also
[44:58] talks about the last days that
[45:00] you know that people will be without
[45:02] natural affection in verse three
[45:05] people don't have any natural affection
[45:07] you know that's why people are such
[45:09] brute beasts
[45:10] because they don't have the the kind of
[45:12] affection that
[45:14] a normal natural person is supposed to
[45:16] have
[45:18] you'd never never kill anybody wouldn't
[45:20] hurt anybody
[45:21] you know if you had the kind of natural
[45:23] affection that god expects us to have
[45:26] that you're supposed to have just
[45:28] natural affection
[45:29] amen and he says that it would be
[45:31] perilous times
[45:32] that would come in our last days because
[45:35] for one thing people are going to be
[45:37] unthankful for
[45:41] unappreciative how many know that we're
[45:43] living in a
[45:44] in a in a country especially especially
[45:47] in a country that is not
[45:48] thankful for their own house
[45:53] for their for the place that you live
[45:54] how many likes where you live at
[45:56] you like your house you wouldn't just go
[45:58] and smear mud and
[46:00] you know go tell everybody i terrible
[46:02] house i ate my house
[46:04] but yet that's what people do and do
[46:07] everything to tear that house down
[46:09] people are
[46:09] not thankful for the blood people
[46:11] spilled to build the house
[46:14] people are absolutely ungrateful
[46:19] and in my opinion i don't have a very
[46:21] high opinion of somebody
[46:23] that is not thankful not very high at
[46:26] all
[46:31] amen and that's the world that we're
[46:33] living in amen
[46:35] as you know it's getting to where our t
[46:38] my our
[46:39] our college students and all those kind
[46:41] of people amen and i don't know about
[46:42] this critical race theory but i'm here
[46:44] to tell you that
[46:44] people are actually being taught and
[46:46] they're actually saying that they're
[46:48] ashamed they're an american
[46:51] he used to be we're proud to be an
[46:52] american and all that right let's try to
[46:54] make him ashamed and you know the thing
[46:56] of this reason
[46:57] where i want to go with this is not
[46:59] necessarily our politics because we know
[47:01] that we're living in a very dark time
[47:03] and it's only going to get darker
[47:05] but i want to talk about god amen and i
[47:08] want to talk about
[47:10] amen being thankful to god
[47:14] amen and giving him the praise that is
[47:18] to his name
[47:19] because when you think about god and who
[47:21] he is and what he is and i want to read
[47:23] a lot of scriptures yet because we want
[47:25] to go over this and
[47:26] i really want to keep you too long but
[47:28] you know wednesday night i know how it's
[47:30] hot
[47:30] you wear out if you work hard at all
[47:32] that energy zaps a lot out of you amen
[47:35] but i was even tired coming to church
[47:38] but i was just tired i rested a lot
[47:40] today
[47:42] i got to catch up i said what tell you
[47:44] you know
[47:46] it takes a lot to get your energy back
[47:47] up but uh
[47:49] in the midst of all that it says look
[47:51] even if you're tired you should still
[47:53] enjoy hey this is your time
[47:54] go and have church go enjoy church you
[47:56] know if you come to church
[47:58] tired that's really good that's a good
[48:01] sacrifice to god
[48:03] that's a good way to praise the lord is
[48:05] just when you don't feel like
[48:07] it when your body's too tired and you
[48:10] don't want to
[48:12] how many has there been there everybody
[48:14] don't want to go
[48:16] your body don't want to get up
[48:19] look at a few modest ones among us
[48:22] but anyway but it's a good sacrifice
[48:25] amen the spotty is not willing but the
[48:27] spirit is amen
[48:29] the fl the spirit is willing but the
[48:30] flesh is weak the bible says
[48:32] so we find that people are lovers of
[48:34] themselves disobedient to parents
[48:37] they are absolutely disrespectful
[48:40] if they'll disrespect their parents
[48:43] they'll
[48:44] disrespect everybody else that's why we
[48:47] don't have any respect for the law
[48:48] anymore because they don't even respect
[48:49] their parents
[48:52] complete disrespect
[48:55] boy i'll tell you what how many knows
[48:57] back in the old days when your
[48:59] grandchild come up to you and they
[49:01] smartmouthed you a little bit they made
[49:03] it to your grandchild but did get it
[49:05] back in
[49:05] pretty good they'd only do it once or
[49:09] twice and that'd be about it
[49:11] why because they were taught respect you
[49:14] teach them respect but people have no
[49:16] respect
[49:17] anymore they don't have any respect for
[49:19] the good things that they have
[49:22] how many knows god is good he's been
[49:23] good to us he's good to the whole world
[49:26] right now god is good to the whole world
[49:29] but that's fixing the end
[49:30] it'll not always be that way amen
[49:33] so we see that they're unthankful unholy
[49:36] amen
[49:39] oh my we think about that in the age
[49:42] that we're living in how that
[49:44] we're living in a disrespectful
[49:48] dishonorable disobedient
[49:51] unthankful ungrateful generation
[49:57] amen and so i like this one leper that
[50:00] came back
[50:02] after being cleansed from his leprosy
[50:05] and he fell down and he
[50:07] got a little loud from what i heard
[50:11] with a loud voice
[50:14] huh lori
[50:18] he he just got all beside himself
[50:21] i mean that's the way kids are when they
[50:23] get real happy they get a little loud
[50:25] they get beside themselves they just go
[50:27] to
[50:27] that's how he felt he was happy
[50:31] because he had been cleansed
[50:37] how many have been cleansed from sin i'm
[50:40] glad when you
[50:41] mess up and when you need forgiveness
[50:44] the lord forgives you
[50:46] and he gives you your peace back
[50:50] amen and you begin to say thank you lord
[50:54] that's one of the things we praise god
[50:56] for amen praise you the lord for
[50:59] his mercy into earth forever
[51:03] amen he's a very merciful god

[52:12] usually something big fourth of july the
[52:13] finale is really big
[52:15] well this is the way the psalms ends
[52:18] amen and what david thinks and the way
[52:20] that david was thinking and
[52:21] the inspiration that he had under him
[52:23] when it came down to the
[52:25] the final chapters of psalms
[52:29] amen and we'll begin with 145 he says i

[57:03] compassion slow to anger
[57:05] and of great mercy
[57:09] the lord is good to

[57:17] whole wide world
[57:18] you haven't got a clue of how god
[57:22] is very very good to you right now
[57:25] any kind of good that you
[57:31] he could crank this thing up about 15
[57:34] degrees
[57:35] and we would be the most miserable
[57:36] creatures upon the faith of the earth
[57:39] wishing we could die
[57:42] and would die from heat exhaustion isn't
[57:44] that right
[57:45] he'd just have to crank the thermostat
[57:47] up a little bit thank you lord for not
[57:49] cranking it up not yet anyway
[57:51] uh he's going to crank it up after a
[57:53] while he's gonna get real hot
[57:55] the elements shall melt with fervent
[57:57] heat

[58:01] mercy
[58:03] they turned down his great they didn't
[58:05] want him amen
[58:09] oh my he is good to all
[58:13] that's right as long as that blood
[58:15] covers the earth
[58:16] isn't that right it protects everybody
[58:21] still grace for everybody as long as
[58:23] that mercy seat is there as long as he
[58:25] sits there on that mercy seat
[58:27] and that blood covers the earth but when
[58:29] that blood is taken away
[58:31] and that right and god cannot have
[58:34] god does not uh
[58:37] intermingle with evil it can't come into
[58:41] his presence
[58:42] no no no no then he's got to purge it
[58:44] and cleanse it
[58:46] get rid of all of it amen
[58:50] and his tender mercies are over all
[58:53] of his works all thy
[58:57] work shall praise thee o lord
[59:01] how many believes that everything all of
[59:04] nature

[59:34] become sinful and
[59:36] amen go out there and you know and
[59:39] and live in sin and whatever we did and
[59:41] god had grace
[59:42] and mercy upon us to put something down

[59:46] ear that we can hear with we say oh

[1:03:00] and that all flesh flesh bless his holy
[1:03:04] name
[1:03:05] forever and ever
[1:03:09] now i just want to take one verse from
[1:03:11] 146 and also one word
[1:03:13] verse from 147 and i'm going to go to
[1:03:15] 148 149
[1:03:17] and 150. 146 to begin with
[1:03:21] not paul but david says praise ye the
[1:03:24] lord

[1:03:43] you might be backwards you might be
[1:03:45] forwards you might be this way or you
[1:03:46] might be that way but
[1:03:47] be yourself be genuine you know when we
[1:03:51] praise the lord we don't want to put on
[1:03:54] huh when we do anything we don't want to
[1:03:56] put on if nothing put on
[1:03:58] is any good for us huh
[1:04:01] why because it's artificial we're going
[1:04:04] to be
[1:04:04] genuine and when we praise the lord
[1:04:08] it doesn't need to just come from
[1:04:09] something that you put on but
[1:04:11] it has to come from your soul
[1:04:15] praise the lord o my soul
[1:04:19] while i live i will praise the lord
[1:04:22] i will sing praises unto my god while i
[1:04:26] have any being verse 40

[1:04:42] and praise is calmly
[1:04:46] yeah amen tell you what you meet
[1:04:49] somebody you should be
[1:04:50] just totally in order for force to say
[1:04:53] to us

[1:04:56] it's calmly
[1:04:58] praise the lord sister god is worthy of
[1:05:01] praise
[1:05:03] he is let me tell you something my
[1:05:06] jordan gets his praise
[1:05:09] muhammad ali got his all of these they
[1:05:11] got their praise
[1:05:12] they got their honor they got their
[1:05:14] glory and paul says that we're to give
[1:05:16] honor to whom
[1:05:17] honor is due glory to whom glory dude
[1:05:20] how many believe god is worthy of a
[1:05:22] whole lot more glory
[1:05:24] than some football or some basketball or
[1:05:26] anything else in our life
[1:05:30] folks there should be things that we can
[1:05:31] get excited about
[1:05:33] that we can be enthused about but not
[1:05:35] like god
[1:05:37] not like the holy spirit
[1:05:42] amen all right
[1:05:45] now let's begin with 148.
[1:05:49] what does it say that's right
[1:05:53] glory praise you the lord twice
[1:05:56] praise ye the lord from the heavens
[1:05:59] praise him in the heights
[1:06:00] now i don't understand that i haven't
[1:06:04] gotten up there in the space shuttle to
[1:06:05] be in the heavens to praise him yet
[1:06:08] right but if you go up there from what i
[1:06:10] understand
[1:06:11] go ahead and praise the lord while
[1:06:12] you're up there praise him from the
[1:06:14] heavens
[1:06:15] praise him from the moon if you go there
[1:06:18] huh
[1:06:19] praise him from the heights wherever you
[1:06:21] are just praise him
[1:06:23] verse 2 praise ye him all his
[1:06:27] angels praise him all his hosts
[1:06:34] amen can i stop there for a minute
[1:06:38] talk about giving god to praise giving
[1:06:40] god the glory
[1:06:41] how many knows that that's what david
[1:06:43] did david gave god to pray
[1:06:48] you know sometimes people like to take
[1:06:50] the glory they like to take the credit
[1:06:52] oh i did this and oh i did that
[1:06:54] okay didn't do nothing amen
[1:06:58] even when david was fixing to take
[1:07:00] eliza's head off
[1:07:02] and what he said he says you know you
[1:07:04] come at me with a sword
[1:07:06] and a shield but i don't come with my
[1:07:09] i come with a sling and a stone but
[1:07:10] that's what i'm bringing i'm coming to
[1:07:12] you and what the name of the lord of
[1:07:15] hosts
[1:07:16] because that's the one that's going to
[1:07:17] do that's the one that's going to get
[1:07:19] the credit
[1:07:20] that's if there's any good in any of us
[1:07:23] isn't that right
[1:07:24] the lord gets the credit because we're
[1:07:26] all evil wicked mean
[1:07:28] nasty kind of people we are men and
[1:07:30] women every last one of them we could be
[1:07:32] very very very wicked
[1:07:35] oh and uh if we were wicked we'd brag
[1:07:37] about who's the most wicked and who's
[1:07:39] the baddest
[1:07:41] why do you think chicago all of them
[1:07:42] guys are killing each other with guns
[1:07:44] they're all trying to prove who's the
[1:07:45] baddest
[1:07:48] they're dead bad people sad ain't it
[1:07:53] they need the lord to realize my
[1:07:56] doesn't lead nowhere but death
[1:07:59] so if any good the good that we've seen
[1:08:02] each other
[1:08:03] the kind handshake how are you doing
[1:08:05] that's the lord
[1:08:07] god bless you brother god bless that's
[1:08:09] all god
[1:08:10] in you and in me caring for one they're
[1:08:14] loving one another
[1:08:15] it's all god he gets the glory
[1:08:18] he gets the praise because he's worthy
[1:08:21] of it all right
[1:08:25] all his hosts he says praise him you'd
[1:08:28] be amazed at how many times
[1:08:30] as david comes down to finishing his

[1:09:30] we'll sting this just a little bit
[1:09:32] but i'm telling you as a pastor most of
[1:09:34] the time one of the things that i have
[1:09:36] to deal with the most
[1:09:37] that reoccurs and that happens among us
[1:09:39] and all of us
[1:09:41] is that people get unsatisfied unhappy

[1:09:49] time again and i'll tell you when you
[1:09:52] become unthankful
[1:09:53] amen you become unhappy this ain't right
[1:09:57] that ain't right i don't like this
[1:09:58] we can go on all day folks it's one of
[1:10:02] the things that a pastor has to contend
[1:10:03] with a lot
[1:10:04] because we as human beings tend to not
[1:10:06] be happy with things
[1:10:08] and that's just not god that does that
[1:10:10] on us it's the devil isn't that right
[1:10:13] amen but thank god he helps and
[1:10:16] snaps us out of it amen we all get that
[1:10:20] way
[1:10:21] amen oh my my wife she reminded me what
[1:10:25] i was talking about a little bit
[1:10:26] reminded me well you know you get that
[1:10:28] way sometimes
[1:10:28] yeah honey you're right but thank the
[1:10:30] lord we we've managed to get through it
[1:10:33] amen praise the lord
[1:10:37] okay where are we at so that's right
[1:10:41] he says uh all his all ye his hosts
[1:10:43] praise ye him
[1:10:45] sun and moon praise him all ye
[1:10:49] stars of light
[1:10:53] write it david say it david i'm your
[1:10:56] audience tonight glory
[1:10:58] that's right david i know where you're
[1:11:00] coming from you just
[1:11:01] know that god is worthy of so much
[1:11:03] praise
[1:11:04] because i can't imagine having been in
[1:11:06] david's shoes
[1:11:07] huh having to kill goliathus and having
[1:11:09] to dodge spears from saul
[1:11:10] and run from saul for many months and
[1:11:13] everything he went
[1:11:14] through with epsilon and everything else
[1:11:15] because of his sin and all the army said
[1:11:17] he camped about him and we're going to
[1:11:19] kill him and swore they'd kill him and
[1:11:20] all the times that he says you know the
[1:11:22] one army will come pass me about
[1:11:24] i will not fear david you had to trust
[1:11:27] in the lord
[1:11:28] david went through a lot so he knew he
[1:11:32] said he's my buckler he's my shield he's
[1:11:33] my strong power he's my defense he's
[1:11:36] everything to me
[1:11:37] and he's just beginning to begin to
[1:11:39] shout out say let the sun let the moon
[1:11:41] let the sun
[1:11:42] that everything prays alone
[1:11:46] because he's worthy of praise
[1:11:51] amen he is isn't he how is the son going
[1:11:54] to praise him well the sun's a time of
[1:11:56] a type of god himself i mean
[1:11:59] without the sun there wouldn't be a
[1:12:01] living thing upon the earth
[1:12:03] without god there would be not a living
[1:12:05] thing upon the earth
[1:12:07] so the son gives him glory the god son
[1:12:09] praises him
[1:12:10] the moon praises him what because the
[1:12:13] moon
[1:12:14] is that's what the moon from what i
[1:12:16] understand controls the tides
[1:12:18] we'd all be sucking water in our lungs
[1:12:21] right now if you're walking for the moon
[1:12:22] the tides come in and just let wash
[1:12:24] everything up
[1:12:26] wouldn't it be nice if uh or shouldn't i
[1:12:28] say wouldn't it be terrible
[1:12:30] if you lived on the coast or somewhere
[1:12:32] anywhere close to a coast
[1:12:33] and you'd never know when the waves are
[1:12:34] going to come in for about a hundred
[1:12:36] miles and when it was and you could have
[1:12:38] fun building a house and here it comes
[1:12:39] and watches away
[1:12:40] but i wish the tides would make up their
[1:12:42] mind of what they want to do
[1:12:46] huh but isn't it something they'll build
[1:12:49] them right there on the
[1:12:50] edge because they know just pretty much
[1:12:52] outside of a tsunami
[1:12:54] they know pretty much where to build
[1:12:55] them amen and lord help them when the
[1:12:57] tsunami does come they ain't ready for
[1:12:59] all that
[1:13:02] they didn't build the planting on the
[1:13:04] tides not keeping their distance and
[1:13:06] staying out
[1:13:07] they didn't plan that they didn't plan
[1:13:08] on earthquakes
[1:13:11] amen that's why i'd want to live up on
[1:13:13] top of a mountain if i was on a coast
[1:13:15] with you
[1:13:16] and get out of florida it's only eight
[1:13:18] foot above water level one little wave
[1:13:19] and the whole thing's gone folks
[1:13:22] no i'm just kidding i get doubt you
[1:13:24] trust the lord anyway right
[1:13:27] gonna get out of somewhere get out of
[1:13:29] california because we know that's the
[1:13:31] of the lord it's going down i don't know
[1:13:33] how anybody's still out there but anyway
[1:13:35] this bellar i guess
[1:13:38] but what is it praise the lord for the
[1:13:40] moon right
[1:13:41] let the moon give god glory the moon
[1:13:44] gives god glory how many knows what
[1:13:46] else the moon is a type of the moon is
[1:13:47] the type of the church
[1:13:51] amen and what does the church do in the
[1:13:53] night time
[1:13:54] it reflects the light of the sun down
[1:13:57] and a beautiful
[1:13:58] beautiful full moon you can almost walk
[1:14:01] without a light
[1:14:03] and that's the way you and i are we're a
[1:14:05] type of the the moon amen that reflects
[1:14:07] the light of jesus christ
[1:14:09] because the sun is so high amen so high
[1:14:12] that it reflects to this
[1:14:14] the moon and it shines down on us even
[1:14:17] when it's on the other side of the earth
[1:14:20] jesus christ was exalted so high
[1:14:23] amen and the light of his light comes
[1:14:25] down upon the church
[1:14:27] and comes out through here you know
[1:14:30] while i was studying this i thought you
[1:14:32] know why don't all people give him
[1:14:33] praise
[1:14:34] he says for everybody to give everything
[1:14:36] all people let him get up and give you
[1:14:38] pray
[1:14:38] but you know the devil in his kingdom in
[1:14:40] this world
[1:14:41] they're not going to praise the lord
[1:14:44] no they're going to throw them out of
[1:14:46] our courthouse and they're going to try
[1:14:47] to get rid of him and after a while they
[1:14:49] won't like god so much they'll
[1:14:50] try to shut us down hello they want to
[1:14:53] get rid of anything
[1:14:54] no they're not going to be giving praise
[1:14:55] the world's not going to give him praise
[1:14:57] but somebody's going to give me praise
[1:15:00] somebody's going to praise the lord
[1:15:02] somebody's going to give god the glory
[1:15:04] and it's going to be his people maybe my
[1:15:07] minority people when it should be the
[1:15:09] whole earth should be everybody living
[1:15:10] on the earth but they are not
[1:15:12] all right now notice
[1:15:16] all right the moon let it give uh let it
[1:15:19] let it praise the lord and it really
[1:15:20] does
[1:15:23] the moon the sun it praises god how
[1:15:27] well just for the fact that it makes a
[1:15:29] perfect circle every
[1:15:30] morning huh isn't it something how they
[1:15:34] can type it
[1:15:34] uh i don't know if it's july or
[1:15:36] somewhere somewhere in this time down
[1:15:38] the days will begin to get shorter
[1:15:40] shorter maybe a minute a day all the way
[1:15:42] to december
[1:15:43] and they can write that out you know
[1:15:46] they can write it out in the calendar
[1:15:48] and they'll be right every time it'll do
[1:15:49] everything right it gives god
[1:15:51] praise because god commanded it and it
[1:15:54] holds
[1:15:56] god's commandment holds
[1:16:01] ah that don't do nothing to the world
[1:16:02] but it does mean
[1:16:04] to know that god's word holds it holds
[1:16:07] the stars
[1:16:08] another place earlier there it says he
[1:16:10] names all the stars
[1:16:11] i mean those are astronomers and
[1:16:13] everybody they got jupiter they got mars
[1:16:15] they got venus they got the big dipper
[1:16:16] they got a little dipper
[1:16:17] and i don't know what all else i'm not
[1:16:19] that's about as far as i've been
[1:16:20] educated
[1:16:21] but all most of those stars got names
[1:16:23] and everything god's got them all
[1:16:25] out there and they all got names he
[1:16:27] knows all about them
[1:16:28] he stretched out the heavens out there
[1:16:30] it says he found he created the
[1:16:32] foundation of the earth
[1:16:34] he created all of that amen let it all
[1:16:37] bring praise to god
[1:16:41] because he's worthy to be praised
[1:16:45] let me tell you something god's not
[1:16:46] worthy of a lukewarmness
[1:16:49] he's not worthy of you know just
[1:16:51] something haphazard or something lame
[1:16:55] some animal that you know like over
[1:16:58] there i believe it is in
[1:17:00] malachi says you know offer now that
[1:17:02] which is lame unto thy governor and see
[1:17:04] if he'll be pleased with it
[1:17:10] when we come to church we as preachers
[1:17:13] we'll work eight hours for an hour and a
[1:17:15] half
[1:17:17] maybe more than that we'll labor and we
[1:17:19] we pray and
[1:17:20] seek the lord and and we're burdened on
[1:17:22] our heart about
[1:17:23] the message and about being in the place
[1:17:26] that we ought to be when we come to the
[1:17:27] house of god isn't that right
[1:17:29] i mean it means the congregation i mean
[1:17:31] it gets something i know how comfortable
[1:17:33] it is back there i'd sit there and
[1:17:34] it can get to where you're just plumb
[1:17:36] relaxed
[1:17:41] and if you aren't careful you become
[1:17:43] dodie and you won't say amen you won't
[1:17:46] wave your hand or hallelujah or whatever
[1:17:48] but that's not the way it's supposed to
[1:17:49] be
[1:17:50] we come to the house of god to worship
[1:17:52] the lord isn't that right
[1:17:54] let's find out so he led us here
[1:17:58] wow praise him in the heavens of heavens
[1:18:02] any waters that be above the heavens
[1:18:06] let them praise the name of the lord for
[1:18:09] he commanded
[1:18:10] and they were created i guess this
[1:18:13] scripture
[1:18:14] explains the first scripture well how
[1:18:16] can the waters way above the heavens
[1:18:18] above the clouds we know that
[1:18:19] the clouds are actually what holds the
[1:18:21] water in there right so he said
[1:18:23] even let the water in the clouds even
[1:18:25] let them praise the lord
[1:18:30] well how can the waters praise the lord
[1:18:32] well brother branham taught
[1:18:35] that those clouds out there they'll
[1:18:39] go out there in the salt water they'll
[1:18:41] pick that supper up
[1:18:43] and it'll cleanse that salt water
[1:18:46] huh i don't know what it does how it
[1:18:48] does it is a miracle but it's god's
[1:18:50] commandment
[1:18:51] it pulls off that moisture because i'll
[1:18:53] tell you what you like dead crops if
[1:18:54] there was salt water weren't coming on
[1:18:56] down
[1:18:58] isn't that right if you pick up that
[1:18:59] saltwater because a lot of that comes
[1:19:01] right off of there
[1:19:03] pulls it off of that comes in and it's
[1:19:05] all refined it's pure
[1:19:07] clean good water
[1:19:11] how many knows is hardly anything better
[1:19:13] than rain water it's real good water
[1:19:15] amen unless it comes down through the
[1:19:18] power plants
[1:19:19] where the power plants are i've seen a
[1:19:20] lot of dead trees going over towards
[1:19:22] knoxville there they've got power plants
[1:19:24] and all the trees the evergreens are all
[1:19:26] dead and i'm like i guess that's called
[1:19:27] acid rain
[1:19:29] that's man's doing not god's doing
[1:19:33] amen so even even he was looking at that
[1:19:38] amen let them praise the name of the
[1:19:41] lord for he commanded and they were
[1:19:42] created
[1:19:43] he also he had also established them
[1:19:46] forever and ever he had made a
[1:19:50] decree which it shall not
[1:19:53] pass you talk about thou shalt not pass
[1:19:57] and they're right when god says it he's
[1:20:00] got to stay in his place
[1:20:01] even the prophet says you say well i see
[1:20:03] a shooting star
[1:20:04] now you see fragments of some kind if
[1:20:07] that
[1:20:08] star ever moved out of its place it
[1:20:10] would just it would it would
[1:20:12] uh mess everything up just like the moon
[1:20:14] if he'd ever got too far away or too
[1:20:16] close
[1:20:17] or the sun get a little further away
[1:20:19] we'd be in the ice age get a little
[1:20:21] closer
[1:20:21] it'd be something else
[1:20:24] amen so he makes a decree which it shall
[1:20:29] not pass
[1:20:29] praise the lord from the earth ye
[1:20:33] dragons and all
[1:20:36] depths
[1:20:39] amen i mean knows all of the things in
[1:20:42] the deep ocean
[1:20:44] it all praises god every bit of it
[1:20:47] praises god
[1:20:49] fire hail snow
[1:20:53] and vapors stormy wind
[1:20:56] fulfilling his word hallelujah
[1:21:01] it's all god's making
[1:21:05] i don't know about you but i like snow
[1:21:08] how many of us is fascinated with a
[1:21:10] snowflake
[1:21:11] wow look at that snowflake we're not
[1:21:13] anymore we're old but when you're a kid

[1:32:00] says you know the reason that we have
[1:32:01] arthritis and
[1:32:03] all these other things he says you know
[1:32:04] it's probably because we should be more
[1:32:06] like the birds
[1:32:09] huh the nightingale at night every time
[1:32:11] the moon comes out
[1:32:13] comes out from behind those clouds he
[1:32:15] just goes to singing and man
[1:32:17] i'll tell you what you ever go to camp
[1:32:19] and aim in on the river and you get a
[1:32:20] nightingale you want to get the shotgun
[1:32:22] out i'm trying to sleep here i don't
[1:32:25] want to hear all
[1:32:26] that work have been going on
[1:32:29] they can make a noise and just keep
[1:32:31] making it
[1:32:37] praising the lord but you don't see no
[1:32:39] ambulance for them right
[1:32:44] every time you get up in the morning
[1:32:45] early in the spring and you go outside
[1:32:47] early and guess what all the birds are
[1:32:49] singing praising the lord
[1:32:52] they're having a good day
[1:32:56] that's right we'd be healthier
[1:32:59] happier if we sang more to the lord and
[1:33:02] i probably won't get to it
[1:33:03] so i'm going to do it while it comes to
[1:33:05] mind is that okay
[1:33:07] this is how paul said that we ought to
[1:33:08] be in ephesians 5
[1:33:10] 19 it says giving thanks
[1:33:13] always how many believes we as
[1:33:16] christians should always
[1:33:18] be giving thanks and that's part of
[1:33:21] worship that's praising god thank you
[1:33:23] lord jesus
[1:33:23] that young uh that that that leper came

[1:33:38] always for
[1:33:40] all things unto god
[1:33:43] and the father in the name of the lord
[1:33:46] jesus christ
[1:33:48] hey i got a little ahead of myself go
[1:33:50] back to verse 19.
[1:33:51] we should be speaking to yourselves in
[1:33:54] psalms
[1:33:56] and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:34:00] singing and making a melody in your
[1:34:03] heart
[1:34:05] to the lord and then it says giving
[1:34:08] thanks always for all things
[1:34:10] that's the kind of people we should be
[1:34:12] people that worship
[1:34:14] people that praise the lord
[1:34:21] all right
[1:34:25] verse 6 of chapter 149
[1:34:28] let the high praises of god be in their
[1:34:30] mouth and a two-edged sword in their
[1:34:32] hand
[1:34:33] to execute vengeance upon the heathen
[1:34:35] and punishments upon the people
[1:34:37] to bind their kings with chains and
