[26:40] got me sappy back there singing and and
[26:44] uh just enjoyed it and maybe we should
[26:46] uh maybe we should have just had a song
[26:48] service this afternoon I don't know but
[26:51] we just do what the Lord's laid on her
[26:52] on her heart and and uh preach what he's
[26:55] laid on her heart and and I like that
[26:58] song they sang Like an Eagle will take
[27:01] to the sky one of these days we're going
[27:03] to wipe away the last
[27:05] tear the last heartache will be gone and
[27:09] like an eagle will take to the
[27:14] sky
[27:16] so if you would turn in your Bibles to
[27:19] John chapter
[27:26] 1
[27:28] we had just a great service this morning
[27:30] we appreciate the word the awesomeness
[27:32] of the word that went forth this morning
[27:34] and speaking about judgment so we got
[27:36] our spiritual bellies full this morning
[27:38] and and then you got your natural
[27:41] bellies full so I know you're tired I
[27:43] try not to keep you and I know we uh we
[27:47] want to come and hear the word and and
[27:49] if you just give us about an hour maybe
[27:51] less I'm I'm not going to keep you and
[27:53] you know the old saying is the the
[27:55] spirit's willing but the flesh is weak
[27:57] uh we're we're willing to be here and we
[27:59] want to be here but in the flesh we're
[28:01] getting tired so uh I know I know where
[28:03] you're at I want to speak to you today
[28:06] if I could on just a little topic of
[28:09] Broken Vessels Broken
[28:11] Vessels and
[28:13] um we today was communion Sunday and and
[28:17] you know I I just think communion
[28:18] Sundays are special Sundays it's a time
[28:21] of remembrance it's a time that we can
[28:23] reflect back and just take some solemn
[28:25] moments to thank the Lord for what he's
[28:27] done for us and and uh so I always try
[28:30] to bring in a scripture if I'm asked to
[28:32] speak on that day of any either service
[28:34] and and just a to just to remember what
[28:36] God has done for us and and there was a
[28:39] I won't keep you standing long but uh
[28:42] we'll get into our scripture but there
[28:43] was a a a clip that was sent to me two
[28:46] or three years ago and it and it it
[28:48] stuck out to me and it stuck with me and
[28:51] I get amused every time I see it and and
[28:53] I can tell it to my kids over and over
[28:55] and I laugh and they because it's Dad
[28:59] you know and uh but it's a little boy
[29:02] and he's sitting at the
[29:04] table and and he's sitting at the table
[29:06] and he's doing a a a word math problem
[29:09] how many loves word math problems me
[29:11] neither we're we're we're just alike so
[29:14] we're in good company I hate them but
[29:16] he's doing the math word problem and
[29:18] he's reading the word problem out loud
[29:20] and he said and the problem reads Jaden
[29:24] has a dollar and Jaden has a quarter
[29:28] Jaden has two
[29:30] dimes and one nickel how much money does
[29:33] Jaden have and he looks up at his mama
[29:36] and smiles and he says Jaden
[29:39] [Applause]
[29:42] broke Jaden broke now I never in a
[29:45] million years thought I would use that
[29:47] in a sermon to to start out a sermon but
[29:50] when I thought about Broken Vessels I
[29:52] thought Jaden broke Jaden had some money
[29:55] Jaden had
[29:56] a150 but in the mind of this little boy
[29:58] Jaden was broke and I'm afraid that's
[30:00] the way we are a lot of times as
[30:02] Christians we have a little bit of joy
[30:03] we have a little bit of happiness we
[30:05] have a little bit of love a little bit
[30:06] of life a little bit of Hope but we walk
[30:09] around like we're broke
[30:11] Christians and so I I thought about that
[30:14] and I thought Broken Vessels what what
[30:16] does that mean there's songs written
[30:18] about it and and so I looked it up and
[30:20] there's actually a scriptural definition
[30:22] for Broken Vessels and it said a person
[30:25] who is destroyed or forgotten or who
[30:27] feels flawed broken or
[30:31] empty and I thought
[30:33] my Broken Vessels how many of us have
[30:37] walked through life maybe this week last
[30:39] week maybe yesterday maybe today and in
[30:42] your life you're thinking I feel so
[30:43] flawed I feel so broken I feel so
[30:47] empty we've all been there and I thought
[30:50] Broken Vessels so let's go to our
[30:53] scripture here and let's look at this
[30:54] and and we'll try to look through this
[30:56] and break it down if we can so John
[30:58] chapter 1 in the beginning was the word
[31:01] and the Word was with God and the Word
[31:04] was God the same was in the beginning
[31:06] with God all things were made by him and
[31:09] without him was not anything made that
[31:12] was made watch this in him was life and
[31:16] the life was the light of man so here
[31:19] Jesus comes on to the scene and John's
[31:20] recounting who Jesus is and he's letting
[31:23] us know Jesus is not an empty broken
[31:26] vessel Jesus is a man of life he is a
[31:29] man that carries the light of men in
[31:31] within him so he is not an empty vessel
[31:35] and the light shineth in darkness and
[31:37] the Darkness comprehend it not there was
[31:40] a man sent from God whose name was John
[31:43] the same for a witness to Bear witness
[31:45] of the light that all men through him
[31:47] might believe he was not that light but
[31:50] was sent to Bear the witness of that
[31:52] light that was the True Light which lith
[31:55] every man that cometh into the world
[31:57] world he was in the world and the world
[31:59] was made by him and the world knew him
[32:01] not now here's one of the most
[32:03] astounding statements in the Bible he
[32:05] came to his own and his own received him
[32:10] not how could you feel any more empty
[32:12] than that right there he
[32:15] came to his own his own received him not
[32:20] but as many as received him listen now
[32:21] there's a different group of people but
[32:23] as many as received him to them gave he
[32:25] power to become the sons of God even to
[32:29] them that believe on his name which were
[32:33] born by your last name no not by Blood
[32:38] it was born not of blood nor by the of
[32:41] Flesh nor by the will of man but of God
[32:45] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[32:47] amongst us and we beheld his glory and
[32:49] the glory of as of the only begotten of
[32:52] the father full of grace and truth and
[32:54] John bear witness of him and cried
[32:56] saying this was he of whom I spake he
[33:00] that cometh after me is preferred before
[33:03] me for he was before me and of his
[33:06] fullness have we all received and Grace
[33:10] for grace for the law was given by Moses
[33:14] but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ
[33:18] you can have your
[33:19] seats John begins to look at this I'm
[33:22] going to lay a little Foundation before
[33:23] we get into our thoughts John John uh
[33:27] begins it looks at this not at the
[33:29] baptism of Jesus like Mark does he
[33:32] doesn't start his writing there he
[33:34] doesn't even start with the conception
[33:35] or the birth of Jesus as as Matthew or
[33:38] Luke write it but he starts at
[33:42] in back in the word all the way back to
[33:46] Genesis 1:1 so John must have had what I
[33:50] would say was a truly great revelation
[33:53] of who Jesus Christ was in this past
[33:57] here Jesus is identified as the
[33:59] Incarnation of Eternal Word so now Jesus
[34:02] has stepped on the word into the world
[34:05] and and he has identified himself as the
[34:07] word come to life for the whole world to
[34:12] see this word is brought into a
[34:15] relationship with God in the closest
[34:17] possible way he was both was was God and
[34:21] was present in the beginning he was God
[34:23] in the creation and it was the
[34:25] uncomprehended source of life life he
[34:27] was that light for humankind he brought
[34:30] salvation into the world are you with me
[34:33] but despite despite John's testimony and
[34:36] what he tells Jesus was not universally
[34:40] received Jesus was not a man that was
[34:43] received through the hearts of all
[34:44] mankind that he come in contact with
[34:47] there were many that couldn't stand
[34:48] Jesus there were many that looked at him
[34:50] and mocked him and and didn't like his
[34:52] Works who tried every way to to send him
[34:54] away and and to get him out of their
[34:56] cities the Pharisees the Sadducees they
[34:58] could not stand the work of
[35:04] Jesus so in this word he became the
[35:08] Incarnate of Jesus John the Baptist
[35:12] tells of his greatness and the author of
[35:15] the book of John adds to John the
[35:16] baptizer testimony and says that Jesus
[35:19] even supersedes
[35:23] Moses this is powerful words they had
[35:26] been waiting and waiting for somebody to
[35:28] come onto the scene for the Messiah to
[35:30] come on the scene and now they're
[35:32] telling this man John the baptizer says
[35:34] this man right here is greater than
[35:36] Moses was ever take and know and know
[35:40] this guy and put your eyes on him and
[35:41] see what he's doing because Moses only
[35:43] gave the law but this man Jesus when
[35:46] he's on the scene he gives us Grace he
[35:48] gives us truth he gives us life he gives
[35:51] us hope he gives us joy he gives us
[35:53] forgiveness he gives us these things so
[35:56] Jes Jesus revealed God the Father whom
[35:59] the world had never put eyes on now he
[36:03] stands in shoe
[36:07] leather now let's fast forward a bit
[36:10] we've laid a foundation of who Jesus was
[36:12] and what John saw and and what John the
[36:14] Baptist testified of let's fast forward
[36:17] a little bit and see what the prophet
[36:18] says about Jesus he said there he was
[36:21] when he was dying Yonder at
[36:23] Calvary everything had rejected him he
[36:27] said they they had spit on him and his
[36:30] face was full of a mockery spit they had
[36:33] a rag around his eyes they hit him on
[36:35] the head and said if you're the prophet
[36:36] tell us who hit you and a little woman
[36:40] run in the midst of him and said what is
[36:42] he done but heal your sick raise your
[36:45] dead and done good and he said they
[36:47] smacked her in the
[36:49] mouth they smacked her in the mouth and
[36:52] said would you listen to a woman instead
[36:53] of your priest away with such a person'
[36:57] and he said his own Dear Mother walking
[36:59] in his bloody
[37:00] Footprints his own Dear Mother walking
[37:03] in his bloody Footprints as he went
[37:04] Yonder to Calvary down in her heart was
[37:07] wondering when she seen her darling
[37:10] child die Yonder a man 33 years old but
[37:14] looked 50 he said the Bible says the
[37:17] strain and and where he probably was
[37:20] turning gray and the grim look on his
[37:22] face to where he was suffering not so
[37:24] much physically but because he was in
[37:30] agony my brothers and sisters can you
[37:32] imagine the pain can you imagine the
[37:35] pain and the anguish that Jesus was
[37:37] feeling down into his heart the
[37:39] loneliness and the emptiness that he
[37:41] must have been going through how he must
[37:43] have felt like some kind of a broken
[37:45] empty
[37:46] vessel and he sits there on the cross
[37:49] and the prophet said he never died from
[37:51] a Roman
[37:52] spear neither did he die from a nail
[37:55] drove into his hand hand or his
[37:58] feet but he died of a broken
[38:02] heart rejected he died of a broken heart
[38:06] being rejected he came to his own and
[38:09] his own received him not and listen what
[38:11] the prophet said he said and you say
[38:13] brother brandom I wish I could have
[38:14] stood there on that day of Calvary he
[38:16] said brother you're standing in a better
[38:19] place today because you're standing in
[38:21] the presence of a resurrected Lord Jesus
[38:24] who has proven himself
[38:27] triumphant We Stand today in the
[38:30] presence of a resurrected Jesus Christ
[38:32] who will never be spit on again he'll
[38:34] never be mocked again he'll never be
[38:37] nailed to a cross again and we stand in
[38:39] the very presence of him today because
[38:42] we are
[38:45] triumphant Psalms 31 I'm gonna go
[38:47] through several scriptures you just have
[38:49] to listen you don't have time to turn to
[38:54] them Psalms 31 have mercy mercy on me oh
[38:57] lord for I am in trouble mine eyes is
[38:59] consumed with grief yay my soul and my
[39:02] belly for my life is spent with grief
[39:06] and my years with s my strength faileth
[39:10] because of my iniquity and my bones are
[39:13] consumed reproach amongst all my enemies
[39:17] but especially amongst my neighbors and
[39:20] I fear to my a fear to my acquaintance
[39:23] that they did see me with without fled
[39:25] from me
[39:27] I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind
[39:32] I am like a broken
[39:38] vessel brothers and sisters this is
[39:41] David we hear this account of David we
[39:43] see Christ and we can look back at
[39:45] others in history job for instance and
[39:47] they go through times when they feel
[39:48] like they just don't measure up we go
[39:51] through times like they did where we
[39:52] feel inadequate or like we're never
[39:55] enough and David Avid says have mercy on
[39:57] me oh Lord because here's David again
[40:00] layment out in sorrow and David is
[40:02] turning his head up in sorrow and
[40:04] layment out to Christ showing that both
[40:06] during their times of rest and during
[40:09] times of
[40:11] adversity God is still there God is
[40:14] still in the presence he's showing that
[40:16] God's people that the adversity comes in
[40:19] Seasons yet David looks to the Lord
[40:21] again it's like we're riding an
[40:22] emotional roller
[40:24] coaster we go high one day and then we
[40:27] go down or like you're on a boat and
[40:28] full of waves and all of a sudden you
[40:31] feel like man you could you could
[40:32] conquer the world and you're feeling
[40:34] good man there's nothing in the world
[40:35] that can stop me and then the next thing
[40:37] you know man there is nothing I can't
[40:38] even get out of bed we're riding this
[40:41] roller coaster and David is talking
[40:43] about this roller coaster and David
[40:45] begins to look back and he even takes
[40:47] some some thoughts from The Book of Job
[40:49] and looks back at job's life and he says
[40:52] my eyes waste away with grief he's in a
[40:55] pable condition here my eyes are wasting
[40:57] away with grief and he's talking about
[41:00] his afflictions you know our our
[41:01] afflictions come in different ways
[41:03] different
[41:04] maners but they all are are are thrown
[41:07] at us by Satan and David talking about
[41:11] his afflictions here the the first one
[41:12] he talks about is
[41:14] physical he says my strength fails me my
[41:17] bone waste away now many times as we get
[41:20] older and we begin to mature and and we
[41:22] become in the veteran age of life and
[41:24] we're getting just about that ready our
[41:26] bones begin to fail us and we feel like
[41:28] we're wasting away and we feel like that
[41:30] Satan has sapped our physical strength
[41:32] to the point that we're approaching
[41:34] death David is describing his
[41:37] predicament at that David was not at a
[41:41] point of death but that is how he
[41:43] described himself because he could feel
[41:45] like he just could not go
[41:49] on our afflictions hit us
[41:52] emotionally David says my life is spent
[41:55] with grief and my years is filled with
[41:56] sign fear is on every side so
[42:00] emotionally David is now feeling drained
[42:03] and pulled down by the hour he's living
[42:06] in how many of us can feel some
[42:08] emotional pull and some drain by the
[42:11] hour we're living in it is a constant
[42:14] battle Satan is not sleeping on the job
[42:16] brothers and sisters it is a constant
[42:18] battle that he's constantly pulling and
[42:21] pulling And the emotions and the the
[42:23] things that you hear the news the things
[42:25] that go on in Schools they're pulling us
[42:27] and draining
[42:30] us
[42:31] social David said I've beeno reproach
[42:34] amongst my enemies repulsive to my
[42:36] acquaintances brother and sisters David
[42:38] says I don't fit
[42:41] in we can
[42:45] say that we don't fit you better
[42:49] emotion you as social mortal he says
[42:53] take they take counsel together against
[42:55] me and scheme to take my life away Satan
[42:57] is constantly scheming against
[42:59] you he is a mortal enemy of yours
[43:03] spiritually listen to what David says
[43:05] because of my iniquities because of my
[43:07] failures because of my shortcomings
[43:10] because of my
[43:12] mistakes I'm not even
[43:14] adequate because of all of these things
[43:16] building up social emotional mortal
[43:19] spiritual I just a forgotten man out of
[43:22] mind and I am a broken vessel
[43:27] it's okay to feel
[43:30] broken David is letting us know you
[43:32] can't overcome
[43:35] Brokenness Jesus let us know that you
[43:38] can overcome
[43:41] Brokenness how do you overcome
[43:43] Brokenness how do you overcome emptiness
[43:45] how do you overcome the the waters and
[43:47] the oils leaking through your vessel I'm
[43:49] fixing You Second Kings 4 1-7 there was
[43:54] a woman there in Second Kings her
[43:58] husband had died she was left with two
[44:01] boys and a big boatload of
[44:04] debt two Bosman are coming after
[44:08] her they're going to take her boys and
[44:10] make them work off the debt and take
[44:12] them in and make them and pull them into
[44:14] to slavery pretty much to work off the
[44:16] debt and Elija says to her what shall I
[44:19] do for thee tell me what hast thou in
[44:22] the house and she said thy handmade hath
[44:25] not anything in in the house except save
[44:28] a pot of
[44:31] oil you don't have no
[44:34] money you you don't have no gold you
[44:36] don't have no silver you don't have you
[44:38] don't have cattle you don't have any
[44:40] sheep have nothing you can barter with I
[44:43] have nothing but a pot of
[44:46] oil
[44:48] Elisha looks down at her said what am I
[44:50] going to
[44:51] do no Elisha says little is much if God
[44:56] is in it Elisha says I tell you what you
[44:59] go and borrow vessels from all over the
[45:03] neighborhood you go and borrow these
[45:05] vessels empty vessels borrow not a few
[45:08] did you hear that borrow not a
[45:15] few and when thou come in thou shut the
[45:18] door upon thee and upon thy sons and Y
[45:21] shall pour out into all those vessels
[45:23] and thou shalt set aside that which is
[45:25] full
[45:26] I'm going to say it again little is much
[45:28] if God is in it little is much if God is
[45:32] in it so she went and she goes and she
[45:34] shuts the door she gathers and brings
[45:36] all the vessels in and she brings them
[45:38] and she begins to pour
[45:41] out and it said it came to pass that
[45:43] when the vessels were full that she said
[45:45] unto her sons bring me yet a vessel and
[45:48] he said unto her there is not a vessel
[45:51] more and the oil
[45:54] stayed amen
[45:57] amen little is much when God is in it
[46:01] then she came and told the man of God
[46:03] and he said go and sell the oil and pay
[46:06] thy debt and live thou and thy
[46:09] Children of the
[46:12] [Applause]
[46:17] rest the prophet says go and go and
[46:21] borrow empty vessels borrow not a few is
[46:25] this strange we think sometimes in our
[46:27] natural Minds that the answer to this
[46:29] woman's dilemma is going to be fullness
[46:31] she's got to have gold she's got to have
[46:33] coins she's got to have how only way she
[46:35] can get out of this is if she's got
[46:36] money or cattle or sheep or something
[46:39] that she can barter with but that's not
[46:41] the way it is the natural mind iMed
[46:43] immediately begins to look for what does
[46:45] she have that she can
[46:46] sell what does she have that she can has
[46:49] an abundance that she can get rid of but
[46:52] that is not the way it is with God God
[46:54] has a different way to deliver her
[46:57] because God has always been in the
[46:58] business of making something out of
[47:02] nothing let me tell you brothers and
[47:04] sisters there is nothing that attracts
[47:06] the attention of the Lord like
[47:09] [Applause]
[47:11] emptiness like emptiness listen what the
[47:14] prophet said he said oh it's God's
[47:16] strategy to take a empty human
[47:20] vessels you and me to take empty human V
[47:25] vessels and shake the world with them
[47:29] that's right that's what the he didn't
[47:32] say he was going to take a bunch of
[47:33] preachers and shake the world he didn't
[47:35] say he was going to take a bunch of
[47:36] musicians and shake the world he said I
[47:38] want somebody that will pour themselves
[47:40] out and let me pour myself in and I'm
[47:43] going to take that person that's willing
[47:44] to be empty and I'm going to shake the
[47:47] entire world with them that's what God
[47:51] is looking
[47:52] for he said look at it on the day of
[47:55] Pentecost what what did he do he said it
[47:56] took them 10 days to get
[48:00] emptied yep there they was in that upper
[48:03] room up there praying and praying and
[48:04] praying God couldn't move on to the
[48:07] scene until the very last morsel of
[48:10] pollution was out of their out of them
[48:13] people and we get down on our knees
[48:15] sometimes say oh God forgive me
[48:18] Phyllis oh God I'm sorry feel me are we
[48:22] really getting down to where the rubber
[48:23] meets of Road and emptying ourselves out
[48:26] completely and getting out every bit of
[48:28] trash and and smoke and mire out of our
[48:32] Lives before we ever ask God to move
[48:34] into our lives we ask God for things but
[48:37] we're asking for things a Miss sometimes
[48:39] because we're not ready to accept
[48:44] God and he said God he took himself and
[48:48] he filled them up because they were
[48:50] standing there with their vessels turned
[48:54] up
[48:56] the only way they could turn them up is
[48:57] if they had took them had taken them
[48:59] from turning them down and turned them
[49:02] up they had poured out everything on the
[49:05] day of Pentecost and he says and that's
[49:07] what we need today that's what we need
[49:10] today is empty vessels brothers and
[49:12] sisters we need men and we need women
[49:13] and young people and children that are
[49:15] willing to empty themselves out and turn
[49:17] their themselves up to God and say God I
[49:20] am clean pour yourself in
[49:24] me
[49:27] pour yourself in
[49:30] me there's a natural law that
[49:33] says that nothing can remain
[49:36] empty everything has to be filled you go
[49:39] dig a hole what happens water comes up
[49:41] in it right yeah you go out there and
[49:44] you dig a post hole you come back well
[49:45] I'll come back in a couple days and I'll
[49:47] put my post in at my concrete you going
[49:48] to have to get the water out first
[49:51] because the hole is filled up either
[49:53] that or the dirt has filled itself back
[49:55] in don't don't ask me how it does it you
[49:57] dig a hole it will fill itself back
[50:00] in you can't wait and that is a law of
[50:04] Nature and since nothing can remain
[50:06] empty and we realize in this condition
[50:09] we have to be intentional we have to be
[50:11] deliberate we have to act uh uh and
[50:14] choose to be emptied we have to want to
[50:16] be
[50:18] emptied you know you can cruise through
[50:21] life claiming Christianity claiming to
[50:24] be a believer claiming all these things
[50:27] you can cruise through life but are you
[50:30] truly empty do you truly allow God a
[50:34] completely clean and empty vessel to
[50:37] dwell
[50:38] in I'm speaking to myself as I looked at
[50:42] this I thought you know what I could do
[50:44] so much more empty and out I could I
[50:47] could get get rid of so much stuff in my
[50:49] life that would allow God more time in
[50:54] it
[50:56] and in our story here he tells her to go
[50:59] and buy go go and borrow sorry go and
[51:02] borrow these
[51:04] vessels and so she goes and she begins
[51:06] to borrow from this neighbor and this
[51:07] neighbor and this
[51:09] neighbor and we don't know what was in
[51:11] those vessels do we it could have been
[51:14] any kinds of many kinds of things filled
[51:16] in those vessels that she borrowed and
[51:18] in those vessels it could have been
[51:19] flour in one of them it could have been
[51:22] meal in in one of them maybe it could
[51:24] have been honey in one of them them
[51:26] maybe hot peppers in another one so
[51:28] she's got all these vessels and and so
[51:31] maybe maybe in one of those vessels
[51:32] there was Envy in one of
[51:34] them did you hear me and one of those
[51:38] vessels maybe there was hatred in one of
[51:40] them maybe one of those vessels was
[51:42] filled with a with a Red Hot Chili
[51:45] Pepper of
[51:49] temper now you can't just take that oil
[51:52] and pour it in there and expect it to be
[51:54] good
[51:56] no we don't know what came in those but
[51:58] one thing we do know that those vessels
[52:00] had something in them and in order for
[52:02] God to use them those vessels had to be
[52:04] cleaned out and that's the way it is
[52:07] with us because these vessels are going
[52:09] to house
[52:10] something good or bad you're going to
[52:13] have something in this
[52:16] vessel but under God's command it says
[52:19] if if he's to use them I can't use them
[52:22] until they're first all emptied out
[52:23] clean out all the old stuff so brothers
[52:25] and sisters regardless of the condition
[52:27] that these vessels were found in
[52:30] regardless of the condition that you're
[52:32] living
[52:33] in there has to be a cleaning and a day
[52:36] when when you're dumped out and cleaned
[52:38] out regardless of what you've done in
[52:40] the
[52:41] past regardless of what Memories you
[52:44] have of the
[52:45] past regardless of where you're living
[52:50] today so if there's anything in your
[52:53] life that's hindering God from moving
[52:56] dump it out get rid of it that's the
[53:00] required condition empty means to have
[53:02] nothing on the inside it means that that
[53:04] you can you have to be there with no
[53:06] worth no significance meaningless
[53:09] lifeless and
[53:12] boy now how many wants to be
[53:17] empty well that's a hard that's a that's
[53:20] a that's a catch 22 is it because man
[53:24] we're that we to work hard in life we
[53:26] ought to be be make our parents proud We
[53:28] ought to make each other proud We ought
[53:29] to be proud for our homes we ought to be
[53:31] able to to do this and do that and and
[53:34] and show ourselves but here's not what
[53:35] it's saying it's telling us we need to
[53:37] be empty we need to be lifeless we need
[53:39] to be void we need to be
[53:43] meaningless because the only way we can
[53:45] make God proud and let him live in US is
[53:47] if that's the condition we're in we have
[53:50] to get to such a place that emptiness is
[53:52] we're speaking of as a condition of the
[53:54] heart it's an attitude it's a
[53:56] disposition of the heart that changes
[53:58] the entire life before God and says God
[54:01] I'm weak I'm hopeless I'm helpless I'm
[54:05] powerless and I am nothing without
[54:09] you you want to get somewhere with God
[54:12] get less with
[54:14] yourself you want to move forward with
[54:16] God and have God to move become an empty
[54:18] vessel Be A Life That's wholly given up
[54:21] to God and fully surrendered a life that
[54:23] is totally surrendered and sustained by
[54:30] God John 15 tells us I am the vine ye
[54:34] are the branches he that abideth in me
[54:36] and I in him the same bringeth forth
[54:38] much fruit for without me ye can
[54:43] do nothing it's plain and simple we try
[54:47] to make it hard we make it hard because
[54:50] we try to do things our way we try to do
[54:53] things the way we want things done
[54:55] that's right but that's not the way God
[54:57] is God says if if I'm going to use you
[55:00] you have to be mine you have to be fully
[55:03] committed you have to be
[55:10] labeled we we had some
[55:12] honey we had some some honey that we had
[55:16] and and we give it out to to various
[55:18] ones well we had Amber Amber and Jordan
[55:22] come and they we give them some honey
[55:23] two years ago three years ago I don't
[55:25] know but it was some of the best honey
[55:28] that you could possibly imagine it was
[55:30] just as crystal clear as as you could
[55:32] ever see they loved it well she she been
[55:36] wanting some more so she come up a
[55:39] couple weeks ago and she went over to
[55:41] ny's house my
[55:43] mother-in-law and she had some honey on
[55:45] the table that had our label on
[55:47] it she ate that honey and she said I ate
[55:51] some of your honey over at nanas I said
[55:53] no you didn't
[55:55] she said it had your label on it I said
[55:58] it wasn't our honey I said that was
[56:01] something we had to we bought out and I
[56:02] just put it in that jar had our label on
[56:06] it she said oh cuz I buy it in bulk she
[56:10] said oh I said but I've got some that
[56:13] the label stands behind what's in it
[56:16] I've got some that's inside the jar here
[56:18] that's exactly come off of our farm and
[56:21] it will put that other to shame you'll
[56:23] like this honey because it's the real
[56:24] deal and that's the way it is with God
[56:26] if God's going to put his label across
[56:28] you and says that's one of mine you
[56:31] better be the real
[56:34] deal John 6 53 then Jesus said unto them
[56:38] verily verily I say unto you I say uh uh
[56:41] very very I say unto you except you eat
[56:43] this flesh of the son of man and drink
[56:44] his blood you have no life in you so
[56:48] we're most valuable when we are
[56:52] empty how many times have we said it I'm
[56:54] must decrease so that he must increase
[56:59] when it when we become nothing he can
[57:01] become everything that's right that
[57:03] that's when something really begins to
[57:05] take place is is when we become nothing
[57:08] God becomes everything there's a story
[57:11] and and we talked about this here a
[57:12] while back but I've I've dug deeper into
[57:14] it with this this story here in 1
[57:17] Samuel Samuel said when thou was little
[57:20] in thine own sight was thou not made the
[57:23] head of the tribes of of Israel and the
[57:26] Lord anointed thee King over Israel and
[57:30] there's a story in the Book of
[57:32] Judges and and this is one I want to get
[57:34] to the story in the Book of Judges where
[57:36] God uses emptiness in a powerful
[57:39] way Judges 7 and16 Gideon divided the
[57:44] 300 men listen to this Gideon divided
[57:46] the 300 men into three companies and he
[57:50] put a trumpet in every man's hand with
[57:52] empty pictures and lamps within the
[57:59] pictures did you hear what I said 300
[58:03] men with a trumpet and an empty picture
[58:07] a water
[58:09] picture with a
[58:12] candle these 300 men carrying a trumpet
[58:15] and a an empty picture with a candle are
[58:19] fixing to go take on a huge medanite
[58:23] Army
[58:27] well little is much if God is in it
[58:32] because here is 300 men taken on this
[58:35] army with no swords no Spears no knives
[58:39] no Shields a
[58:42] trumpet and a empty water picture with a
[58:46] c are you getting the picture brothers
[58:49] and sisters I don't know about you but I
[58:50] don't find that too
[58:53] intimidating
[58:55] if I'm the midianite Army and I'm
[58:57] looking up there and I'm looking down on
[58:59] them on them guys them 300 men I'm
[59:01] looking down and I'm probably yelling
[59:03] what you g to do with them trumpets in
[59:04] that water pcture are y'all going to
[59:07] cook us some soup and sing us a song or
[59:09] what are y'all going to do are you going
[59:11] to serenade us with your
[59:14] trumpet that's right because if I'm
[59:17] going into battle I'm planning and
[59:20] preparing to take on men with swords and
[59:23] shields and Spears and
[59:25] catapults and armor that that's what I'm
[59:28] looking for and here I'm looking at an
[59:29] Army full of men with trumpets and an
[59:31] empty water
[59:36] picture it what it was that made their
[59:39] picture valuable was God's
[59:41] purpose see it wasn't the beauty it it
[59:44] wasn't their beauty it wasn't the
[59:45] particular shape or the design of the
[59:47] water pictures it had nothing to do with
[59:49] what they were used for in the past had
[59:52] nothing to do with any of that it didn't
[59:53] matter whose house else it come from it
[59:55] didn't matter if those pictures were
[59:56] made of gold or silver or clay or or
[59:59] whatever none of that stuff mattered or
[1:00:01] brass that wasn't what God was looking
[1:00:03] for but what made them valuable to God's
[1:00:05] purpose is the same thing that makes us
[1:00:07] valuable to him today and they were
[1:00:11] empty they were empty and they were
[1:00:16] breakable we don't like to be broken do
[1:00:20] we oh
[1:00:22] boy I got one sitting right there and
[1:00:25] there's one sitting right there that
[1:00:27] does not want to be
[1:00:29] broken they got the the the the uh that
[1:00:33] they could be
[1:00:34] twins 16 15 16 years
[1:00:37] apart Carson and
[1:00:40] sa they don't want their Spirit broken
[1:00:43] when they set their mind to something
[1:00:45] they're going on they're going to dig
[1:00:47] their heels in they're going to keep
[1:00:50] going on till they accomplish what
[1:00:52] they're looking to
[1:00:53] do am I right Austin smiling yeah he's
[1:00:58] thinking man don't don't be bringing my
[1:01:00] family into
[1:01:02] this it's all good it's all good it'll
[1:01:06] all work
[1:01:08] out but we don't like to be
[1:01:10] broken we don't like our spirit broken
[1:01:13] we don't like somebody to tell us no we
[1:01:14] don't like for somebody to say you've
[1:01:16] got to fail before you can
[1:01:18] succeed you know what I found out
[1:01:20] everybody wants what you got but they
[1:01:22] don't want to do what it takes to get
[1:01:24] what you
[1:01:25] got let me tell you some of the most
[1:01:28] successful people in the world ever to
[1:01:30] walk on the face of the Earth whether it
[1:01:31] be business or Athletics or or just just
[1:01:35] in life in general marriages they
[1:01:37] because they
[1:01:39] fail over and over and
[1:01:43] over but they don't stop right they keep
[1:01:46] digging in their heels and say we may
[1:01:48] not have made it today but
[1:01:51] tomorrow is a different day exactly
[1:01:55] right Baby Ruth had 780 or 700 and
[1:01:59] something home
[1:02:00] runs held the record for years but they
[1:02:03] never talk about the 1400
[1:02:06] strikeouts and you know what his motto
[1:02:08] was don't let the fear strike it out
[1:02:10] keep you from playing the
[1:02:14] game unbre we don't want to be broken
[1:02:17] but God tells us we got to be breakable
[1:02:19] these pictures were empty they were
[1:02:21] breakable and if you want to get God's
[1:02:24] attention and show him your emptiness
[1:02:26] show him that you're empty and show him
[1:02:28] that you want to attract the heart but
[1:02:30] because you're
[1:02:32] breakable you'll never serve God's
[1:02:35] higher purpose until you get empty and
[1:02:37] broken before
[1:02:38] God you say man I thought you preachers
[1:02:41] were pepping us up here at the last days
[1:02:44] I thought you preachers were trying to
[1:02:45] get us ready for a rapture we
[1:02:47] are if your vessel is not completely
[1:02:50] empty God can't completely fill you
[1:02:53] that's right
[1:02:57] God does his be best work with broken
[1:02:59] things broken pictures broken bread
[1:03:02] broken
[1:03:04] hearts you know they didn't even realize
[1:03:06] who Jesus was until he broke the
[1:03:09] bread when he broke the bread they began
[1:03:11] to realize by the scars on his hands I
[1:03:13] don't know or by the way he broke the
[1:03:15] bread but they said oh we know who this
[1:03:17] is and he
[1:03:19] vanished so God does great things in
[1:03:22] broken pieces
[1:03:25] so here they were these pictures now
[1:03:27] let's look at these
[1:03:29] pictures they were empty to hold a
[1:03:32] candle these these water pictures were
[1:03:35] empty to put the candle
[1:03:37] in secondly they had to be broken to
[1:03:41] allow the light that was inside to be
[1:03:43] seen to release the treasure that was on
[1:03:46] the
[1:03:47] inside now it just I hope I can I hope I
[1:03:50] can get this across to you the way it
[1:03:51] came to me but when I read John chapter
[1:03:54] 1 one and it said
[1:03:56] in him was life and the life was the
[1:04:00] light of men in
[1:04:03] him was life and the life was light of
[1:04:06] men here they have a picture they have a
[1:04:10] candle he's the life the light of men
[1:04:13] they put the light into the
[1:04:17] picture and then when the when the the
[1:04:20] they they begin to go and the but the
[1:04:21] light on the inside has to be seen
[1:04:26] you know we can have all of God in us
[1:04:28] till we're full to the top to the very
[1:04:30] tip of our
[1:04:31] hair but if the world never sees
[1:04:34] him if the world never sees God living
[1:04:37] through you if if the world never sees
[1:04:40] God speaking through you and walking
[1:04:42] through you and talking through you and
[1:04:44] ministering through you what good is all
[1:04:46] of that light going to
[1:04:52] do and unfortunately many Christians
[1:04:54] have forgotten that our reason for being
[1:04:56] saved is not to be a have a more
[1:04:57] comfortable life and that's a common
[1:04:59] misconception boy if I get saved life's
[1:05:01] going to be easy I'm in cruise control
[1:05:03] because God loves me and I'm going to be
[1:05:05] blessed boy that's a what a that's a
[1:05:08] real wakeup call when that don't happen
[1:05:10] it brother Troy you know what I'm
[1:05:12] talking about life life begins to happen
[1:05:17] but but the real thing is to manifest
[1:05:19] the reality of the resurrection of a
[1:05:21] savior to the world yes that's what the
[1:05:24] is that's what the life and the light is
[1:05:26] that's on the inside of us is to let the
[1:05:28] world know that there is a resurrected
[1:05:30] savior who can come and cut you loose
[1:05:33] who can free them who can save them who
[1:05:35] can deliver them who can heal
[1:05:37] them how does the world know that by
[1:05:40] going to church no they don't go to
[1:05:43] church they know it by watching you they
[1:05:47] know it by hearing your testimonies they
[1:05:49] know it by by seeing you and they say
[1:05:51] that woman right there she's a walking
[1:05:53] Mir mirle because she has been
[1:05:55] completely healed of
[1:06:05] cancer but to manifest the beauty of
[1:06:07] this resurrected
[1:06:10] savior here Gideon is with these 300
[1:06:13] soldiers a trumpet a pitcher and a
[1:06:16] candle the candle inside the picture and
[1:06:20] all of a sudden the Army begins to S to
[1:06:23] to scream to scream out at the top of
[1:06:25] their voice and they begin to look out
[1:06:27] there and they begin to holler out and
[1:06:29] they begin to scream out of what that
[1:06:31] look at what God this is the sword of
[1:06:33] God and Gideon
[1:06:37] yes and the pictures the light goes
[1:06:42] forth and they scream this is the sword
[1:06:44] of God this is the sword of Gideon and
[1:06:47] they said God turned the swords of all
[1:06:49] of those men upon themselves and they
[1:06:52] fleed the scene and God won
[1:06:57] victoriously little as much when God is
[1:06:59] in it it don't matter if it's a water
[1:07:01] pcture a candle a trumpet it doesn't
[1:07:03] matter but if God is in it and you're
[1:07:05] letting God have complete control watch
[1:07:08] him move on the
[1:07:09] [Applause]
[1:07:11] scene empty vessel the prophet said
[1:07:14] borrow not a few brothers and sisters we
[1:07:17] shouldn't hold back on
[1:07:21] God brother B's been preaching a lot
[1:07:24] here lately about ask big things get big
[1:07:30] results
[1:07:32] well if you going to ask for big things
[1:07:35] and you going to take this bottle cap to
[1:07:37] catch all of God's oil you ain't going
[1:07:39] to take home a
[1:07:43] lot if I had up here
[1:07:46] today put that right
[1:07:48] there if I had up here today and said in
[1:07:52] this back room right here I've got a
[1:07:53] garden h
[1:07:55] and out of that garden hose flows pure
[1:07:57] Liquid
[1:08:01] Gold go get all the vessels you can
[1:08:03] carry bring them up here we'll fill them
[1:08:05] up you can have all you can carry out of
[1:08:07] here well y'all setting off a
[1:08:10] Ste cuz I know better if y'all thought
[1:08:13] that was a true statement if I could
[1:08:15] produce that You' be running out there
[1:08:16] trying to find every water trough you be
[1:08:18] opening the hood on your trucks you be
[1:08:20] backing your cars up here and fill this
[1:08:22] vessel fill this
[1:08:24] vessel why is it when we talk about God
[1:08:26] we don't do that bring all of your
[1:08:29] vessels to God if you need Joy bring a
[1:08:31] vessel for Joy if you need happiness
[1:08:34] don't settle for just Joy get happiness
[1:08:36] too get love get Deliverance get Freedom
[1:08:39] get get rid of fear and take on the good
[1:08:42] things the peace of
[1:08:43] God bring your
[1:08:46] vessels not a few bring them all bring
[1:08:49] them
[1:08:51] all it was not when the there was no
[1:08:54] longer a a empty vessel that the oil
[1:08:57] stopped flowing if we could just have a
[1:09:00] fresh flow of the Holy anointing of
[1:09:03] God we would see that we could have the
[1:09:06] peace and the security and the love and
[1:09:08] the freedom and happiness and
[1:09:10] forgiveness
[1:09:12] and
[1:09:17] joy but we must come
[1:09:19] empty I want you to listen to this
[1:09:22] again fixing the close I'm going to
[1:09:25] break 40 50
[1:09:27] minutes maybe God's strategy don't
[1:09:31] forget this God's strategy is to take
[1:09:34] empty human vessels and shake the world
[1:09:38] with
[1:09:40] them shake the world with
[1:09:48] them turned up and God took himself and
[1:09:52] filled him up that's all and they shook
[1:09:54] the world poured himself into him that's
[1:09:58] what we have need today is empty vessels
[1:10:01] so that God can fill them up God cannot
[1:10:04] use them as long as they're already
[1:10:06] filled
[1:10:10] up now listen to this I like this Elijah
[1:10:13] didn't say some vessels and borrow a lot
[1:10:16] of oil and we'll see if we can get a
[1:10:18] good sale price on it and get you a
[1:10:21] little more than what we can so that we
[1:10:23] can pay your neighbor back he didn't say
[1:10:27] that see we try to barter
[1:10:31] sometimes but he didn't say that he said
[1:10:33] go bring me some empty vessels that's
[1:10:36] all you need he said brothers and
[1:10:38] sisters he says as it was on the day of
[1:10:40] Pentecost they had those empty vessels
[1:10:42] so God could fill them up and he says
[1:10:45] brother listen now this day demands
[1:10:50] that this day demands that this day
[1:10:54] you've got to have that will'll have
[1:10:56] that or will'll
[1:10:59] perish you see how important it is that
[1:11:02] we empty oursel out that our lives this
[1:11:04] little short period of time we're here
[1:11:06] really doesn't mean a
[1:11:08] lot
[1:11:10] right we've got to have that or
[1:11:18] perish he says brother listen to this
[1:11:23] I'm close
[1:11:24] the lid has come off of Hell the streams
[1:11:28] of demon power is pouring from
[1:11:31] everywhere it's conquered the Nations he
[1:11:34] didn't say it will
[1:11:36] conquer he said it's conquered the
[1:11:39] Nations right it's conquered
[1:11:44] politics man I hope Trump
[1:11:47] wins it don't
[1:11:49] matter it's conquered the politics till
[1:11:52] it's rotten to the core it's
[1:11:55] conquered the churches that's until they
[1:12:00] know nothing but
[1:12:02] denomination you say well I'm a
[1:12:04] Christian I'm a he says I'm a Methodist
[1:12:07] are you a CH Christian
[1:12:10] I'm no more than being a pig or a hog or
[1:12:14] a horse or something
[1:12:16] else now that sounds pretty
[1:12:18] harsh you go tell that to your Baptist
[1:12:22] friends
[1:12:29] Go Tell it to your Catholic friends you
[1:12:31] might get a
[1:12:33] [Applause]
[1:12:36] curing that doesn't matter it has
[1:12:39] nothing to do with it you're a Christian
[1:12:41] when you're born again and filled with
[1:12:43] the Holy Ghost not until that not until
[1:12:45] you're yielded completely to the spirit
[1:12:48] if you are not yielded to the spirit
[1:12:50] then you are never born again and you
[1:12:51] don't have the Holy Ghost you might
[1:12:53] speak in tongues and river and jump and
[1:12:55] run and do all kinds
[1:12:57] of he said but what we need oh God I
[1:13:01] feel it pouring in through here now what
[1:13:03] we need is a prophet of God who will
[1:13:06] rise up with a thunderbolt of
[1:13:09] God I think we got
[1:13:12] that we know what we have need of and
[1:13:16] and more and more I study this message
[1:13:18] the more and more I realize that I got
[1:13:20] something that the church world does not
[1:13:24] have and if I'm not careful and if
[1:13:27] you're not careful we will take these
[1:13:29] very
[1:13:31] quotes the very very scriptures we'll
[1:13:35] take them for
[1:13:37] granted we will we will fail to realize
[1:13:40] how important and how blessed we are as
[1:13:43] a people at the Bri of Jesus Christ
[1:13:48] we've been told that our whole life so
[1:13:50] it's it's common to us but we can't let
[1:13:52] this message message become common to us
[1:13:55] when he tells us we have to be empty we
[1:13:57] got to be empty when he tells us that
[1:14:00] politics has been conquered it's been
[1:14:02] conquered when he tells us the
[1:14:04] denominations have been conquered it's
[1:14:06] been conquered so we have to take these
[1:14:08] and live by these words and don't take
[1:14:11] them for granted and he says so get weak
[1:14:13] so you can get
[1:14:16] strong how many tonight would say God
[1:14:18] help me get weak so that I can be strong
[1:14:23] help we get weak it'll conquer every
[1:14:26] devil he said it'll put the learned to
[1:14:31] [Applause]
[1:14:34] shame you know your kids can teach many
[1:14:37] of
[1:14:39] theologians they won't believe
[1:14:41] them but they can teach
[1:14:44] them they can tell them truths that the
[1:14:46] world has never
[1:14:49] heard you're five year olds six year
[1:14:52] olds eight year
[1:14:54] olds why because God has found empty
[1:14:59] vessel willing to accept the word and
[1:15:01] the message of his
[1:15:04] hour he says remember as it was in the
[1:15:07] days of Noah so it'll be in the coming
[1:15:08] of Son of Man eight Souls were saved
[1:15:11] think in the Days of Elijah there was
[1:15:13] 7,000 only had it just think we're
[1:15:16] living think we're we're living now when
[1:15:18] John came on the scene the little church
[1:15:20] was certainly in the minority but there
[1:15:22] was empty
[1:15:23] vessels to pour the oil in God let us
[1:15:29] empty ourselves up let's stand to our
[1:15:35] feet as the musicians
[1:15:38] come he says get empty
[1:15:42] friends get
[1:15:44] weak deny your own
[1:15:47] ability that's hard for
[1:15:50] men that's hard for for humans to deny

[1:15:55] ability because it's easy we want to fix
[1:15:58] things we want things to be our way and
[1:16:00] we can do it I can do it I know I can do
