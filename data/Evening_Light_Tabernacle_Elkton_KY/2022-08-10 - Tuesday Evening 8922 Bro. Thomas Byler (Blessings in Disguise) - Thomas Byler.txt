see Grace is there any way that you can zoom in with that camera I'm going to need it here in a little bit okay but I um just wanted to give the church a little report if that's okay Amen on two issues and one of them is my health amen not so long ago I guess about a week or so ago the devil brought me a box of rattlesnakes amen and so that box of rattlesnakes is high sugar and I'll tell you um I'm just thankful the Lord that I found out what it was and no brother Steve Langley I think when was it brother Steve last Wednesday last Wednesday but if Steve after I told him that I was having a hard time seeing way off easier to see close but not as easy far off amen he says you know you need to go get your blood sugar checked you know and and I ain't never worried about my blood sugar at all and uh so anyway I once before brother Steve had given me advice I didn't take it and while I was sorry I didn't so I appreciate brother Steve's advice and uh but anyway I uh went and then I got me a tester you know and and I was feeling a little bit better you know doing a little better than what I had been and I tested it and I don't know how far it didn't go 500 did it go with them those testers against him little electric ones used to pinch blood and the second time was four 80 or 90 something like that and what brother Dave what what numbers are coma numbers okay well anyway the first time I tested this is after I'm doing quite a bit better okay well anyway the first time I tested this is after I'm doing quite a bit better all right it it it didn't even say anything he said it uh it said hi that's all it said said hi so I was like well that don't tell me much other than that I want a number and it was the second time that I checked that it was 470 or something so anyway and I believe it was during this time that I've had this covet and even a little before maybe I you know I'd have to go to the bathroom a lot and when I got sick uh you know with the covet and all I would get thirsty and of course I'd be using the bathroom almost every hour of the night and I was like man what is all this you know and so this must be the covert stuff you know but anyway I'd get cottonmouth like crazy I'd get thirsty and I'd go get apple juice and pure grape juice and get me some orange juice and I drank up 25 30 worth one time and did it twice went up to the Food Giant and did it again you know uh but I'd go outside sometimes looking and it was just like man this is bad it's just terrible you know and I thought it was covered right amen even two Sundays here ago when I preached on uh I preached a couple I think it was last the other Sundays I was up here and y'all were blurry yeah honestly you were blurry and you know remember when I got the flashing a little bit you know I had to make myself stop I was getting silly my wife silly but anyway I realized that it had to be way up there over 500 I don't know where in the world it was but when you drink a gallon a half a gallon of orange juice on the way I saw I'll quench this earth right well anyway it's a miracle I didn't kill myself right I said I would I had to be next to a coma many times for many days to be honest with me I'm different times I'd say how in the world am I going to preach like this you know this just keeps going on and on and on and carrying on that's why I was out for so long tried to get as many ministers in and everything I could you know but anyway so that's where it's at and uh like I I think I told my wife I said the other day I said honey I'm really eating right now for the first time in my life but anyway because I am you're all gonna eat all the wrong food and everything but anyway so uh I love to drink apple juice and orange juice you know I've drank a lot of it and now vinegar you know um a couple things that we need to make sure everything's all right but anyway so you have to watch it but anyway so just pray for me amen and so the first thing I wanted to say while you've got diabetes you know not what you think that's what you want to tell yourself I got diabetes that might even told Caleb I might have it or whatever you know and so and he said he'd rebuked me he says Dad don't you accept that dollar right about uh box of rattlesnakes amen and I said that's right son I'm sorry for saying that because I don't want to say that I don't want to say it you know because the second you say I've got that you just signed let me know that you just signed you said you had it you accepted it amen so I always say I have blood that's sugar that's a lot that I'm fighting with that's what I'm fighting well I pleasure nothing Valor can't take care of right amen and that's that's what I will say in forever amen I'd be like John Ryan I don't care how long it takes I'm here praise the Lord keep on going and so anyway it was up from 470 Saturday I think last Saturday and uh then it dropped down to 325 or three somewhere 350 somewhere in there and I said well if it ain't better by Monday I'll go to the dock you know and so anyway Monday come along and it was around 250 225 at a time you know jump back up to 350 something that says and Caleb and them's a better go into this so uh anyway but I didn't go back went yet but anyway so uh I know it you probably should but anyway I think we was 217 the uh yesterday afternoon and so I think another day because on the strict diet and so uh I think we'll get it back down I plan on getting it back down to you know 180 140 130 whatever it's supposed to be amen and try to just diet right Eat Right amen and so that's where it's at and so if I acted a little silly amen one time I had I know sometimes you say say stuff you know your mind Skips a little bit right not especially when you're up there it's a wonder I didn't skip more than I did but anyway I'm just thankful I'm thankful because when I was here I was good enough to preach you know and that was over 500 so and it was way I I had I don't know I really had to be way out there folks so thank the Lord right that he spared me watch that for me and then I went and took the test just to find out you know and to me I didn't want to hear nothing of it even though my dad had it pretty heavy and my mother got it at 80 just before she passed away she said she had it you know but my dad had it heavy I think Grandpa and a lot of in our families have it has it has it hasn't yeah but anyway so I've never worried about it you know and and didn't accept their claim it so but I praise God that uh you know 60 years you know without any of that problems I praise God for it amen amen and so anyway um I thought well I got to thinking about it you know and all these weeks coming up to it and how really bad I felt just not wanting to do anything couldn't hardly do anything and now that I'm gonna die this is man I'm singing I'm happy I'm you know even in the 250 realm hello 275 around me there I I'm feeling really good you know and so um I'm thankful to feel better and to know what it is and what I'm fighting amen like brother Steve said you got to know what you're fighting and so forth and so I'm thankful to feel better and I thought well you know hmm you know I said I know the Lord doesn't allow anything to come upon you unless you're allows it is that right nothing comes on you unless God allows it so you know I thought well maybe maybe this is a blessing in disguise that's gonna be my title tonight and so because you know if I I told my wife and my wife even said you know you just can't eat them half gallon of ice creams and all of that other stuff and every night you know that hot dog you know anything I want to eat you know I was getting a big belly and stuff and I was I jumped back up there to well we won't say the number but anyway for the eye and so you know I thought well you know if I kept going that way in five six years who knows I'm gonna had a heart attack right a stroke who knows what happened so if God allows this to thin me down and to get me on a DOT Eden right and feeling better you know I'll probably live longer this way I would do the other way so I you know I don't know amen I don't know if just what the local plan of the Lord is but amen all things work together for good to them to love God how many believe that and so anyway just pray for me that uh amen I've got a wonderful wife back there that cooks some really good food and I'm telling you what happy I was real happy when I heard that you could eat meat shrimp shrimp right I got a lot to learn but I'll tell you what all of them things sauce together pretty good it's pretty good amen so it's not not you know but I'm just thankful amen that God watched over me during the time that I tried to quench my thirst and the higher it would go the drier my mouth would go the more I'd drink and you know you you know where you're going to go there you know and so praise God I did amen but by the grace of God and I'm thankful for it so just letting you know where I'm at amen and so forth with that so just amen claim my healing for me and don't sign for me all right would you mind not saying brother Butler's got that you know don't sign for me please you know we're believing with him that his uh high sugar will be controlled and the Lord will just keep it the way it's supposed to be amen so yesterday my wife just a little funny my wife she said well let me check mine oh my you ain't never seen when I got that little pricker closer she was just screaming at home oh my but praise the lord we checked it into 133 right there where it's supposed to be for the Lord so amen that was funny I reacted but anyway so that's good praise be to God brother and sister Byler amen and this is from Brother Barry brother Byler and the Saints God bless you and thanks so much for the offering sent for the people of you crane the needs are great and they are continuing to experience real hardships in the shadow of the war your support is very timely God bless you and thank you amen amen that thing just carries on and Carries On doesn't it amen one more thing I want to do here this is when you might want to zoom in hey man talk to trustee board Deacon board and so forth and about uh the Mennonite that came to us and wanting to buy some of this field back here I mean they're Rocky rough terrain down there and uh then of course we know that I think it's Joe hunt over here he also Brother Brad had said that he wanted to find out if we ever sell that landed back there or whatever he want to know so I went and talked to him the other day he says he's all hyped up about it so what we want to maybe do and back again to the story of the deacons and trustees everybody's in favor of bringing it before the church and then let the church vote whether we might want to sell it and then take however much we get and pay off the principle of the church amen and we don't know how much we don't know exactly the boundaries and all that but we're going to get as much as of course we possibly can and right now of course the prices are real high and it seems the selling's pretty easy so I think it's definitely a good time amen but uh we want your permission I mean it's up to you if we don't sell it that's fine too you know uh just whatever whatever we want to do but since they asked somebody asks and I know how rough the land is and stuff I'm not I'm not all that gumbo about it and if somebody wants to give me a pretty good price for it I'm I'm like well hey be nice to have this place paid for we're not so that's the plan is to go to that I wanted to show you and I might Sunday again too but I want to show you a little bit of the idea if anybody has really curious of where the property lines and what we want to do is uh we're going to cut it off first I'll just explain that you all know the woods down here so it'll be on that side of the woods coming up right up to the edge where that starts to curve up and go over you know on our this year that's going to stay but down over the edge down in the edge of the field well my fence line basically you'll see in the fence line back there maybe just a little bit further that way up to the corner of the woods and then it'll go either straight across all the way there but if we sell it to Joe hunt then we need to come and angle it back from the other corner to it angle it back up to his yard like or just a little bit just enough to where he can get on that from his property amen and were Mennonites not listening but uh I would favor I would favor It with Joe because I know that he'll probably just have some cows and a food plot on it or whatever but the other Mennonite was talking about maybe selling it to somebody that's interested in maybe putting a he mentioned a butcher Butcher Shop like Fairview butchering or whatever down somewhere over there if that was the case of course we want to plant some trees along that fence down there so it's just pretty much closed from there there and you won't see it much more than it's be about as far away as from this up this would be up here so that's kind of where it's at I hope everybody out there is getting it and listening because I want you to pray about it till Sunday and then I'd like to take a vote Sunday all right if uh I could get a couple people come up here and hold this for a minute all right can you zoom in I we might do this Sunday yet but uh I'm just going to put it this way we'll show it tonight and then if anybody's curious about property lines please uh contact one of us and we'll we'll go over it with you so that you can understand both here and out there okay so here's the uh old church facility this is the fellowship hall and of course this is where a volleyball is here this big church is somewhere right here okay and this is the property line on the corner of that back woods over there and that's pretty much pretty close to my fence that I got running through there so it would be right through here all the way up to the edge of this woods and then this is this is the old Daniel Bell it's Joe hunt now but we would either come well whoever it is Woods is I'm not sure just where this wood is but from here across like this way and if uh we could go to any of these Stakes to make sure that joke could access this us trustees and deacons will really decide on some of this here that all has to be these guys and Survey but it goes way down it and our property doesn't go to the edge of the field even though I fenced it all off and then my cows on there for many years they said hey you know them rock quarry people don't like people on them too much you might get in trouble so anyway I wish all back up to the property line and I'll need to get the fence down but it's not all the way in the field it goes back here a little bit from the edge of the field up okay and then this runs along the houses out there way out there it runs right along the back of them houses it goes across the ditch partially up in the woods there's you know quite a bit right over on the other side you know but the creek runs down through here somewhere but uh this is the section from here over it wouldn't you know we still have room for plenty of room back here if we wanted to do something and we'll have the field over here on the side straight down behind the fellowship hall that little field still be ours graveyard all of that air is gonna be us okay but pretty much from the back side of that Woods over and maybe a little jot over is what we're thinking about selling okay all right so everybody pray about that and if you have questions let us know all right let's stand go before the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we come before you once again Lord grateful Lord to be in your house Lord to have strength Lord Jesus to have energy Lord Jesus to be able to worship you in spirit and in truth to bring honor glory to Your Name Lord and we ask God that you would just bless the service tonight in every aspect Lord and a little thought that heal Lord You've laid upon my heart to minister God may it be a blessing father to those here and those that are out there on the web Lord Jesus watching bless them father in Jesus name amen amen if you will turn to Hebrews the 12th chapter and tonight I had two Germans on my heart and I'm not really going to say that uh but this is one time that I've chosen felt led to changed what I was going to preach tonight because I was going to go a different route most all day but I had another thought laid on my heart and and something just I just felt led to preach this tonight because uh this will be a little shorter and the other one I would I definitely like everybody here because it has to do with the squeeze it has to do with uh modern events that are being made clear by prophecy so probably Sunday morning it'll be modern events May being made clear by prophecy things that's going on that prophecy that's coming to pass and so forth and I've had a lot of reading a lot of quotes from brother Brandon but tonight uh that little thought came on to the little thought came on to me about blessings in Disguise amen and so we want to just speak a little while on that um let's go with Hebrews 12. Hebrews 12. and verse 5. and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despised thou not the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth receive it if ye endure chastening God deals with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement whereof all our partakers then ye are bastards not son furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and gave us them and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they merrily for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterwards it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercise thereby wherefore lift up the hands that hang down in the feeble knees in other words be encouraged you know right and I like the part where it says for rarely verse 10 for they verily for a few days chasing enough that chastened us after their pleasure their own pleasure but he for our Prophet amen for our Prophet I mean it's for us that mean my partakers of his holy Holiness may God add His blessings to the reading your word the message of course being blessings in disguise blessings in Disguise or disguised blessings I like that disguised blessing now you all know that I have preached on trials and tests and all of that 100 million well not maybe that much time but a bunch of times you know right a whole lot of time but this is just another little angle if that's all right is that okay amen so we see here that uh God of course he allows tests or trials whichever you want to call them because to me they're about same thing trial is a test amen talking about it's for our good amen it's for our good not just for our parents good or whatever but it's for our good amen that things and trials and things come upon us praise God Amen because you know I I you know it you know it's yeah whenever something happens to you you know or when something bad happens to somebody else or whatever you know sometimes it's a like a recession but when it happens to you it's a depression amen it's a little different story when it comes down home so that's the way it is with me tonight it comes down home amen and and so uh you know but I'm so grateful I'm so grateful that it doesn't matter it no matter what comes down your road as long as God is with you isn't that right amen he'll take care oh I'm so glad to have a caretaker amen praise be to God Amen now listen now brother bam says now before you can have a victory there has to be a battle if there's no battles there's no Victory so we ought to be thankful for the battles into trying is God given us the opportunity to have a victory amen praise the Lord oh my don't that make you feel a lot better now see the battle comes along and somebody's saying something bad about your sickness come on you maybe God gave you those light afflictions that he might heal you to show you favor to you let you see what it what he means by it he loves you amen like the old Shepherd story that was told there of Jerusalem in the Holy lands of the Shepherds and the shepherd was packing a sheep and he said what are you packing it for said it's got a broken leg and they say well what what did it what happened did it fall over a cliff said no I broke his leg no I broke his leg while you are a cruel Shepherd to break that sheep's leg said no I loved it and said it was going astray and I couldn't make it mind me so I broke its legs so that I could give it some special attention so that it would love me more and follow me sometimes God has to let us break down just a little bit in health to give us a little extra attention praise be to God oh my tonight I want to talk a little bit about people who tonight I want to talk a little bit about people who have the big you know the times that we ask what is God doing huh what is going on here you know because God does that in our lives what's going on how can this be of God huh Amen to woo us up in his bosom when the doctor said that nothing can be done then he takes into his us into his bosom and says I love you I'm gonna let you get well see oh he does doesn't that just make you feel a little bit better praise the Lord how many knows that everything that happens it always brings us closer to God the trials and the tests and the things that we go through does one more thing and that is it brings God more Glory I remember brother Branham he was preaching and he said and and get in the service bless the service Lord and get glory to yourself God get glory to himself because I mean please knows that he's worthy of Glory honor power strength everything he's worthy of all that oh he's so great he's a marvelous Shepherd isn't he no wonder David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he leads me beside the Still Waters he restores my soul and runs our cups over and anoints us in the presence of our enemy that's the only quote we have tonight amen so I like to go down a little bit can we just take a little trip amen amen all the way back oh my we could go so far back but we see how that so many times God allows us to get into places that we don't understand amen but I go to the scripture where Romans says for whom he did no not for whom did for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God how many believe that to them that are to call according to his purpose God makes if you're part of God part his program he makes all things work for the good and I want to take some instances in some cases tonight to where ultimately even though it was the most horrible things that happened to people in the end there was a blessing behind it all at all it looked terrible trials look terrible they seemed terrible isn't that what it said Chast typing and all these things said are Grievous but it yields the Peaceable fruit of righteousness it always comes out right amen we think about we think about of course you know how all the way let's talk about Israel perhaps you know on that day gloriously come out of Egypt and come up down to the Red Sea isn't that right now right they come down there and they could not understand what's going on they complained didn't they he ran straight down to the Red Sea to a dead end a place that couldn't go further forward they couldn't go backwards they couldn't go sideways it seemed bad huh it seemed so terrible that the people no doubt what's going on what's God doing what's going on here huh but in the end what did it do it brought glory to God like you've never seen God opened up a path God opened up a way for him and on the other side they were screaming and hollering and Miriam dancing up and down and everywhere wasn't she that was a blessing there there between a rock and a hard place that place a dead end seeming light ended up being a blessing just like the prophet said you know he may take you to the hospital the doctor May say you're gonna die huh pretty rough place huh but you find out most of the time it brings you closer to God there's something beautiful that comes from it amen when I was so sick and and getting better and so forth beginning to feel better you know I just appreciated feeling better so much more not only that I was weak in my flesh but I was closer to God I began to understand you know sometimes that's what Paul talked about when we're weak in our flesh then we're stronger in the spirit he brings to Israel weak in their flesh they couldn't do anything but if data just believed right and trusted God it had been so much better off amen but we know that most of them didn't pass a test did they no they didn't realize hey there's a blessing in that if we could just realize that because there's many times many things that happen terrible in our lives losing loved ones it can be anything that we might think we want to thank God how can this be good how can this be good huh but you know I believe the prophet says you shouldn't question God you should realize that everything that happens to a believer and I believe it I believe that nothing can come upon nothing can happen to you without permission I'd have never got that box without permission first huh I ain't got to sign for it but God's going to get Glory out of it all amen praise be to God same way with Israel if they said look we're in God's hand God is more than able amen remember Israel at Katie sparnia y'all remember when they finally made all the rounds and they were fixing to cross over and despise went over across there and meant we know that the spies came back ten of them and they said man the walls they run chariot races unto at Jericho isn't that right they were on jediers Giants folk I have to hide behind the bushes before all that big giant stomp past me it was scary folks huh so how many knows that the the uh the obstacles that they faced were great don't never think that God's gonna give you a little obstacle unless that's all you can handle you God usually gives you big obstacles real tests real trials like he did death half of them or ten of them said we aren't able to take it it's way man they're way too strong for us amen if they had just believed so now we don't know here we are we're facing these big giants and big city walls and big things that you can't handle that you can't do if you could just realize hey this isn't got to be a blessing in this somewhere huh because when they finally went over there in that right when they crossed and I'm thinking that they dried up the water again didn't they went on dry ground again the second time to cross over amen and did Joshua I love that little song my grandkids and I catch a few of them sing I wish Grace you would have them sing that song Sunday maybe Joshua was how was it Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho Jericho is that right there he was and he went around and around and around he didn't just realized this is gonna turn out to be a blessing whoa walls come tumbling down praise be to God you could just realize that your trial is a blessing in disguise don't believe that yeah it may seem really bad but guess what if you trust the Lord in it there's a God speaks to do something when he heals you when he makes you better whatever he does what's it going to do brother bam says he gives you that so did you have a testimony of how real God is in your life especially if you start straying or getting away from God is that right he just may break your leg it would be hard to understand wouldn't it seeing a shepherd and a broken leg and say I broke it huh but that little lamb can't get around it has to be handled it probably has to be held half the time and laid there it has to be brought its food and it has to be taken care of it has to be I have a whole lot of love it'll appreciate walking it'll appreciate its master amen oh my thank you Lord Jesus for watching over me amen I'm glad to have a shepherd that Watches Over You takes care of you amen heals you back up praise the Lord oh my it was terrible when Israel under Saul were pinned down by the Philistines in Goliath for days and weeks perhaps would get out there and run his mouth and they'd have to listen to his mouth all the time they were scared because they had no doubt got beaten back isn't that right they got beaten back and they said man we are the armies of God you know what we were supposed to be Victorious and here we are hiding in our foxholes this enemy of our keeps posting huh oh you're 425. you lying devil up you ain't got no rights here no think about it that Old Devil thinking about man we're good you know y'all serve us you know and so forth but what was God doing they were all tense they were all stressed but you know different times when God was going to make somebody king or raise him up or make him popular among the people or like among the people are accepted or honored or whatever he wouldn't allow something to happen you know and he was letting him he would letting Israel come in that place God had a plan I mean God had a plan all things work together pretty good he added David bring a little basket of food for his brothers the plan Here Comes God's plan he's going to make it to work for the good here comes the blessing David and all he did was bringing the brothers food the brothers were skeptical of it and then shyster soda's big you come down here because you wanted to see the battle you know my dad told me to bring that food all of a sudden David heard off in the distance I defy by the armies of the Living God and all this other stuff why there's water around here he got inspired isn't that right he got inspired that's the difference when you get inspired this who is this uncircumcised feelings see running his mouth I'd like to shut him up you know and he went over there and David was a nobody David was just sheep her he couldn't even join the Army he was too little probably huh couldn't even join and so forth you know it's all after uh David told him look God delivered the lion and the bear to me he'll deliver him to me put all of his armor on and his get this off of me just give me my slinging God and we'll take care of it and been out of that terrible situation there what happened greatest blessing great is blessing Amen to David when he went over there I don't still don't know how nervous everybody was all the unbelievers have to be nervous seeing this little running fella going over there and we're all going to be slaves right they were a little bit unbelievable there's a lot of unbelieving Israelites they're always complaining and murmur and never believing that anything's possible but when that big old giant fell backwards in the dust flew up David went over there amongst dust cut his head off and come up out of the dust and said here it is everybody got inspired how many knows when one person in this church if one person will get inspired you don't know but the next person I didn't might get inspired we need people that get inspired we need now do you want me inspired or do you want me to just well now we're gonna learn our ABCs tonight and you know is it nice to have it inspired or anointed preacher amen and I want to tell you this I believe every one of us can be inspired every one of us anointed but it all depends on how much you get into it is that right been a while since I heard come on brother by the preach it it's okay you know it's taking me on be all right but he got inspired not and it inspired the rest of the Israelites they come jumping up out of there and it said they chased them and they chased them till dark all the way to the further parts of the land killing them left and right you know that's what happened in our day a David called mother Bynum inspired by God comments begin to shoot the enemy back so the days of Miracles is not fast all things are Tommy Hicks I believe in the different ones amen that went out and got into a room after they seen such person healed and he asked whether around him hey do you think that God would sue that you know for anybody yeah he would he went in the room and began to pray and he went out and God did a lot of the things through his ministry I mean most of those ministers even the prophets that most of the ministers what do you call uh rose up rose up under the prophet's Ministry and went out and many of them went out and did because of the inspiration but it was a blessing in disguise even though they were bogged down didn't know where to go can you imagine I would hate to be Saul I would hate to be a king in a stalemate nobody's going anywhere all you can do you would be praying God help me God help me yeah right how about Hezekiah this just comes to mind I remember Hezekiah the armies were all going to come against them you know and they did not have near enough to defeat him they were going to come in and they shed them send them letters of intimidation and so forth and intimidate them with the letters to set and everything you know but Hezekiah got in sackcloth now I should I believe it was her he got down before the Lord and he cried out God didn't yeah in a bad situation it was terrible the Army was going to come in on him but God delivered them how by causing them to turn on each other oh the more I talk about this faith comes by hearing the more I thankful to be serving a god that is a god of your everyday that you live no matter what happens no matter what comes your way God is God and he's not dead he's still alive amen it's the same yesterday today we're not just deserving the god of history but we're here servant of God of today amen praise the Lord another reason that I'd all happened was because David need to be magnified amen after that he become very popular isn't that right very popular and eventually become king and that was God's way one way of God's one of God's ways to magnify David amen all right Joe let's talk about job for just a minute everybody anybody would wonder what in the world is going on even his friends and close friends said you're a secret sinner nah nah nah God's breaking your leg for sure uh but no it was simply because God was challenging the devil I was challenging the devil and he used job to beat him huh his job to beat the devil because he comes right down to it when he was so miserable Oh my he could he oh my job was miserable it was a terrible thing boils and he cursed today he was born and the son that it wouldn't shine on that day and all kinds of things oh he was very miserable amen and his wife seen him so miserable he said why don't you just Curse God I don't want to see you suffer like that Curse God and I I love you she might have went meant well but Paul said Paul said here we go job said thou speak is like a foolish woman and he worshiped God I mean when you're going through trials you know how you worship God you say the lord gave the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord amen and he would not and he came out and the Bible says that he had twice God doubled everything he had and he gave him his children amen how did he give him his children only as a prophet of God in this generation could really tell you how didn't raise him back up but he gave him to him over there oh my you have to ask yourself if God would take your children like that huh wouldn't it be it's the most horrible thing would be to lose your children and then put something like that on you and you're like man what could I do because didn't do nothing but when his promise was that he would have his children it'd be like okay because perchance somehow or other they may be lost otherwise but God gave them it you're gonna have and not that but it was a blessing in disguise he gave him twice as much as he had before poor job was too busy after that wasn't he hey man because a lot of times we have so much until we're too busy but he's a large blessing in disguise Joe's trial was a blessing in disguise nothing seemed good you couldn't understand why what is God doing amen praise God what about the widow woman God-fearing lady isn't that right she had to be a God-fearing lady for Elijah to show up at her house amenity come right down to the last meal her and her son the last meal I got just a cup of this just a cup of oil I can make some bread and so forth we're gonna eat it and then we're gonna die and then the man comes along and says well bring me that first what wouldn't it be hard to understand uh yeah take my last what but she was praying she said okay can you imagine she was a giving person and she says well we're going to die anyhow let's give this man all right yeah she was willing to give it it looked bad the whole situation looked bad and then to ask that but it was a blessing coming down to her Lane a blessing in disguise all the days of the drought she ate good how many well I shouldn't do that how many knows the prophet typed her with the pride in this generation you know where there's a drawing a thirsty man or no food and no water is she says the people are drying up people are dying but the bride is going to have food stirred up she's gonna have a good good eating every day good Feast every day all the time until this is over aren't you glad it's not going to run out that's going to keep bringing us food he's going to keep feeding us all the way to the Rapture as a matter of fact you have a smorgasbord well everybody is dying of food and hunger and sir amen you are eating good hold on praise aren't you glad for that I'm very thankful for that it was a blessing it was a blessing in disguise her getting right down to that but she was still under the care of almighty God she was willing to give her last meal to God's prophet and after that and I don't imagine that she had to wait till evening if she wanted a snack at three o'clock or two o'clock it's all right take a little more out praise be to God aren't you thankful for that that's you you are all black you ain't lacking nothing God has given us everything we have need of amen it seemed real bad things went South for Jonah things went bad for donut and you know that brother Benham always stuck up for Jonah right wanna write and pretty much said the permissive what was the perfect will that knew just what he was doing but he picked the man that would not want to do the job all right that would go the other way because guess what he was going to have a fish prepared another way and preach to him and so forth and he went the other direction and then things began to get bad what happened until they threw everything out of the boat that they could possibly throw out of the boat to lighten the boat so they wouldn't die and it still wasn't enough and the boat was filling up and they cast lots or something amongst themselves to find out who why this is why is this storm this why are we going down that came on Jonah didn't it look at Jonah Jonah they fell on you it's you so there Jonah was at the sink he says well this is really turning out bad this can't be any worse what in the world is going on here as they grabbed him by his hands and his legs right and threw him in the water can you imagine he thought this is it I'm never gonna have to go to Nineveh now this is it I'm out of here I'm dead you know I'll never lose terrible you have to have a terrible feeling getting thrown into that ocean way out there in the middle of nowhere amen but I think it proves that God had it all planned out because the Bible says he had a special prepared fish amen but a bam said that there was an atheist or somebody saying proving that the Bible is wrong because he would take a great big Quail or something and said the the hole ain't big enough for a man to go through but random couldn't stand it he says you know he I beg to differ with you he says the Bible says that it was a special prepare I want to use the word stupid right now huh if God can make a whale he can surely prepare a special one with a big enough throat huh he made it all to begin with but doubting God the Bible says that it's true amen made a big throw he'd swallowed him how many knows three days and three nights don't have to think about it right he won't let me die going to go let me die here I am it is um how many months to talk to Jonas say was it really bunch of slobber what was what was it like all that muck in that acid and I'm telling you what I don't know about you but in three days You're Gonna feel the acid you're gonna feel something it's gonna be sticky dark huh [Laughter] [Music] my bad situation very dark bleak but it was a blessing in disguise why because you see when the fish spit him out that fish I'm just going to perhaps say that he did like some sharks too perhaps and wiggle this way up to the beach and everybody was at the beach that day why I'm up through there and I said oh you got big trash you know and all of a sudden that big fish opened up out comes a man huh out comes a man on his hands and knees got spitting cloth everywhere come on the beach gets up everybody all kinds of mess isn't that right man man you know take some water to wash off and they're all right they're either that fish just spit a man up he got up y'all better repent y'all better repent on 30 days God's Gonna destroy all of you huh what did they do the governor and everybody this spread like wildfire said we better repent and we're going to perish and it just so happened that their God was a fish God right our God spit a man out to tell us we better repent we better repent ah and it's just what they needed he brought it in a way that they would hear it praise be to God you would wish it for this generation wouldn't you but God brought it he brought it and the way that they really couldn't deny it I mean if they can't deny it no they couldn't deny it that it was God coming and bringing it to him and they look at it they hear it and you either have to accept it or reject it like the brother bam says you know you just have to say this I ain't Shining I'm going to the basement and I'm shutting the windows and it's not sun shining out Christ hasn't come he hasn't Vindicated himself he hasn't prove himself God isn't real what he has right in front of you amen so this generation doesn't have any excuse do they no they're not going to have an excuse God did everything he possibly could to get this generation's attention to get them to repent amen amen last of all Jesus and the disciples all right that end the end of Jesus and the disciples was horrific it was terrible as brother bam says they were all deflated they didn't know what was going on what is going on we know he said something about dying and raising again but he's gone all our hopes are gone huh they came and they took him away now they have crucified and killed him and they all a lot of them went fishing a lot of them went ran their own different ways isn't it they all scattered it was so dark and Bleak until Peter was hungry and cold and he went in amongst a group to get a little food I believe it is and the worm himself you know and he was there by the fire and somebody says oh look oh look hey you were one of his disciples aren't you huh oh no doubt looked at him and he knowed him what could happen they may crucify him right they're gonna catch me no I'm not can you imagine how Peter felt how horrible it was to deny Christ not once what was it but twice three times before the crows crows that will deny me Thrice amen second time now we know that no I'm not yes you are blankety blank blank I am not you have to feel bad after that one didn't he oh yeah said he cursed to get him to convince that he wasn't the follower maybe after the curse words you're like well yeah you're probably right nobody would curse like that that was following him trying to convince him that he wasn't one he said he said I would do that what did he go out and weep bitterly bitterly weak it was dark dark hour so dark the sun refused to shine isn't that right for so long the time it was a dark hour but it was the greatest blessing ever in disguise I mean those the sufferings of Christ the terribleness of it all was the greatest blessing the world has ever known because God was going to purchase every one of his children he was buying him back he was purchasing this world he was making a way for you he was making him wait for your healing he was making a way for your salvation he was making the way for everything he says if I don't go away the Holy Ghost can't come I've got to go Peter didn't want this to happen because he said you know he took up well what did he say this should never happen I believe she said and Jesus said get thee behind me thou I say thou savior is not the thing to be of God and when it actually come time for them to come and take him I don't know where in the world did Peter find a sword I guess maybe the carried one I don't know maybe he grabbed one off of the soldiers or something I'll show you I used to be a soldier you reckon he was aiming for the ear or the head imagine your name before the year if he was aiming for the hearing he was a really good shot but not least smitten a split his skull this ain't happening ain't gonna take my master but they did huh isn't it amazing no doubt there was an angel there I'm not going to let him be a murderer and he put his hand right there let him get the ear Jesus did what perhaps picked up the ear but he said she went right back in there took his hand off perfectly normal give me that blind that means you use the word blind everybody saw that and they still don't believe he's the Messiah huh very very sad isn't it for them to be able to see something like that and still not believe that he's the Messiah and say no no no let me isn't it true that whenever they something else because it should have caught their attention because if I'm not wrong when they came Powers him what happened didn't the Bible says that they were not back they were knocked back by the power of God the first time they were knocked back if I'm not wrong and then they come again try it again I don't know about you but you think a person with sense would say woo I don't want a part of that did it they were persevering but out of that amen dark hour for the disciples very dark hour and for Jesus too I don't know if he was a very dark out for him he's a 50 cup if it'd be possible let this pass from me but nevertheless not my will he wept in the garden and so forth fought the greatest battle he ever did for you and for me so that 2000 and what is it 22 you could enjoy the peace of God if you could un you could enjoy the forgiveness and Grace of almighty God and all of his blessings what a blessing it was in Disguise they thought it was horrible but to round out it wasn't so horrible amen when Peter got the revelation that he was alive isn't that right he heard he was alive and he believed he's alive didn't he run him and John they had a foot race they must have been kind of young couldn't have been my age they'd only got a few blocks and that had been hit they ran all away they just run and my they leaked for Joy he's alive he's alive he's alive and Unforgiven amen oh my Heaven's gates are open wide he's alive how many loves him but God bless you so let's stand tonight how many wants to understand that in your life and are what God allows to come your way remember it's a blessing in disguise if you are part of God he'll make good out of it all things work for the good for them that love God to them that are called according to his purpose to draw you closer it's to bring goner and glory to God heads Lord Jesus we come before you Lord Jesus and sometimes we fail in this area Israel certainly did but help us not to help us to realize that when something comes our way we look at the good in it we look at look at what you might be doing and what you what you're going to accomplish through this Lord Jesus for the battle is not ours the battle is yours we are your children father we're in your care and we know that the will of God will never take us anywhere that the grace of God can't keep us and take us through or tonight we raise our hands God forgive me if we have failed Lord Jesus and help me from this night on to realize that whatever happens whatever box that God allows to come to your door even though you don't mind for you realize it's God allowing it amen to see what you'll do and to bring you closer to God we ask God that you'd help us to realize that all of these trials are for our own good they make us better people they made it make us better Christians father amen and we ask God that you just bless us with a closer walk with you father thank you for your healing thank you for your grace
