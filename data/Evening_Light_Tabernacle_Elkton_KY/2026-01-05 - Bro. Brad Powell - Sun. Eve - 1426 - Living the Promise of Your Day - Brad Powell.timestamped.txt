[29:30] And he paid [music and singing] a debt
[29:33] at Calvary.

[42:52] the king. Give the Lord a hand clap of
[42:54] praise this afternoon. Hallelujah. Thank
[42:56] you, Lord. We praise you, Lord Jesus. We
[42:59] surrender all to you, Lord. Thank you,
[43:01] Father. Glory. Hallelujah. [applause]
[43:04] Man, hasn't it been a wonderful day in
[43:06] the Lord?
[43:07] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, this morning in service
[43:09] and and the songs and and just
[43:12] everything, we're just we're just
[43:13] grateful and thankful for what the
[43:14] Lord's done for us. And I just want to
[43:17] kind of uh re reiterate and and not to
[43:20] add to what Brother Ber preached this
[43:22] morning, but just to say how good 25 was
[43:24] and how much better 26 is going to be
[43:27] &gt;&gt; in the Lord. Amen. If you would turn in
[43:30] your Bibles, I want to speak just a a
[43:33] short sermon and if I could, I I've got
[43:35] probably got enough notes for uh for a
[43:37] couple hours here. And uh but I'm I'm
[43:40] going to keep it brief if we can. So, I
[43:42] know you're tired. You've eaten well and
[43:44] you've eaten well twice today. So, we'll
[43:46] just go for dessert. How's that? And uh
[43:49] I want to speak if we could living the
[43:51] promise of your day. And as you're
[43:54] turning into the book of Joshua, we will
[43:56] be reading out of there the book of
[43:58] Joshua in chapter 1. And speaking on
[44:01] leaving living the promise of your day,
[44:03] Mark Twain said this, "The two most
[44:06] important days of your life are the day
[44:08] you are born and the day you find out
[44:11] why."
[44:15] So you know you think about that quote
[44:17] there what he says and he's emphasizing
[44:19] that your birth I it it it grants your
[44:22] existence it brings you into this world
[44:25] but the second part of that when the day
[44:27] you find out why you were born that
[44:29] places you into a place that you gives
[44:31] you meaning to your existence
[44:35] &gt;&gt; so we look at that and thinking about it
[44:36] the prophet he says this he's talking
[44:38] and he says Jesus Christ is in the
[44:40] building tonight think about the quote I
[44:42] read and the quote that the prophet
[44:43] saying he says we're the Jesus Christ is
[44:46] in the building tonight to perform
[44:48] miracles but he does it through his
[44:50] church his people they shall lay their
[44:53] hands on the sick they shall recover in
[44:55] my name they shall cast out evil spirits
[44:57] is that right he says that's a
[44:58] commission given to the church that's
[45:01] what's the matter with the church today
[45:03] it doesn't know his position
[45:05] take it back to our title living the
[45:07] promise of your day
[45:10] &gt;&gt; he said if you know positionally listen
[45:12] to this. If you kned positionally who
[45:14] you was and what you are tonight, there
[45:17] wouldn't be a feeble person in here in
[45:20] the next five minutes.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "That's right. The thing that
[45:25] it is, you're looking off into a
[45:27] millennium somewhere for something to
[45:28] happen when it's already here." He said,
[45:32] "Now, we are the sons of God. Not we
[45:35] will be, but we are right now." He says,
[45:38] "When?" Right now. Right now. this
[45:41] minute we're seated in heavenly places
[45:43] in Christ Jesus. He said, "Oh, if you
[45:46] could only recognize that and the
[45:48] supreme authority that Jesus Christ has
[45:51] given to every believer."
[45:54] &gt;&gt; To every believer. Anything you have
[45:57] desire of, any need, only thing you have
[46:00] to do is ask and receive it. Whatsoever
[46:03] you desire when you pray, believe you
[46:06] receive it and it'll be given unto you.
[46:10] Joshua. Let's read out of Joshua. We'll
[46:12] get you to have your seats. I want to
[46:13] leave you standing for a little bit
[46:14] because I know how it is when you sit
[46:16] down after a meal. So, you stand and
[46:18] I'll stand and we'll all just be happy.
[46:20] Y'all want to stand the whole service?
[46:25] Joshua chapter 1. Now, after the death
[46:28] of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it
[46:30] came to pass that the Lord spake unto
[46:33] Joshua the son of Nun, Moses's minister,
[46:35] saying, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now
[46:38] therefore arise. Watch what he says. Go
[46:41] over this Jordan, thou and all this
[46:43] people, unto the land which I do give to
[46:47] them. Brothers and sisters, that is a
[46:49] promise. That is a promise that God made
[46:52] to the children of Israel. Now listen to
[46:53] what the promise is. that every place
[46:55] that the soul of your feet shall tread
[46:57] upon, that have I given unto you, as I
[47:02] said unto Moses, from the wilderness of
[47:04] Lebanon, even unto the great river
[47:05] Euphrates, to the land of the Hittites,
[47:07] unto the great sea towards the going
[47:09] down of the sun, shall be your coast.
[47:12] There's, now watch, there shall not be
[47:14] any man be able to stand before thee
[47:18] all the days of thy life. Now, here's
[47:21] the key part. As I was with Moses,
[47:25] so I will be with thee. I will not fail
[47:28] thee, nor forsake thee. Listen to what
[47:30] he said. He said, "As I was with Moses,
[47:33] I will be with you. I will not fail you.
[47:36] I will not forsake you." It didn't say,
[47:38] "There shall not be any man able to
[47:40] stand before you because you are greater
[47:42] than Moses." No, he didn't he didn't do
[47:45] that. But God clearly told him how to
[47:47] keep things in perspective. It's not
[47:49] about you, Joshua. It's about me. It's
[47:53] about God. It's about God in our lives.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; And if we're going to be victorious, if
[47:58] we're going to be able to live the
[48:00] promise in our hour, we have to keep
[48:02] this in perspective. Turn with me
[48:05] quickly to Joshua chapter 3.
[48:13] Joshua chapter 3
[48:16] 7-13.
[48:18] And the Lord said unto Joshua, "This day
[48:20] will I begin to will I begin to magnify
[48:24] thee in the sight of all of Israel, that
[48:27] they may know that as I was with Moses,
[48:31] so I
[48:32] you hearing me? So I will be with thee.
[48:36] And thou shalt command the priests that
[48:38] bear the ark of the covenant, saying,
[48:40] When ye are coming to the brink of the
[48:42] water of Jordan, ye shall stand in the
[48:45] Jordan." And Joshua said unto the
[48:46] children of Israel, "Come hither and
[48:48] hear the words of the Lord your God."
[48:53] Emphasis on the Lord your God. And
[48:56] Joshua said, "Hereby ye shall know, ye
[48:59] shall know that the living God is
[49:01] amongst you." Aren't you thankful
[49:03] tonight that a living God is amongst us?
[49:06] &gt;&gt; The living God in this hour is amongst
[49:08] us. And Joshua is telling him, "Hereby
[49:10] you know that the living God is amongst
[49:12] you and that he he he without fail drive
[49:17] out from before you the Canaanites, the
[49:19] Hittites, the Hivites, the Persites, the
[49:22] Gersites, and the Amorites, and the
[49:23] Jebusites.
[49:25] Behold, the ark of the covenant of the
[49:27] Lord, for of all the earth passeth
[49:30] before you unto Jordan. Now therefore
[49:32] take you 12 men out of the tribes of
[49:34] Israel, and out of every tribe of man.
[49:36] And it shall come to pass, here we are
[49:38] again, as soon as the souls of your feet
[49:41] of the priests that bear the ark of the
[49:43] Lord, the Lord of the all the earth
[49:46] shall rest in the waters of the Jordan,
[49:47] that the waters of the Jordan shall be
[49:49] cut off from the waters that come down
[49:51] from above.
[49:53] All the floods going to stop. All the
[49:55] problems going to stop. Why? Because
[49:56] they got God first.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; And they'll stand up on a heap. Praise
[50:02] the Lord.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; May God add his blessings to the reading
[50:04] of the word. can have your seats.
[50:09] Let me see what time we are. 3:00. Can
[50:12] we have
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Can we have a few minutes? I'll leave it
[50:16] that way.
[50:19] So, the prophet of God begins to tell
[50:21] the story here of Joshua. And and we
[50:23] look here and he talks about Joshua, how
[50:25] Joshua has been a warrior, how Joshua
[50:28] has been elected of God. He's been
[50:29] chosen of God. And he meets this king.
[50:32] And we think about Joshua here as he
[50:34] meets this king, this great man, the
[50:36] prophet said, was standing up next to a
[50:38] wall and he's standing there near
[50:40] Jericho. This man as a warrior and he's
[50:43] and Joshua now begins to see a real
[50:46] visible thing. Now, no doubt that the
[50:49] man that he saw, he he had confidence.
[50:53] The man that Joshua approaches, he had
[50:55] confidence and he could see that he he
[50:57] had a he had authority. This man that
[51:00] Joshua sees, he had he had overcoming
[51:02] power. He had something in his eyes that
[51:06] Joshua had never seen in the eyes of any
[51:08] man before. So, brothers and sisters,
[51:10] who do you think this man was standing
[51:12] against this wall that Joshua comes up
[51:14] and walking out of the wilderness from
[51:16] Jordan to Jericho? Who was this man? Who
[51:20] was this man that he had come in contact
[51:22] with? I hope that we have met this man
[51:24] in the hour that we're living that we
[51:26] have come in contact with a man of
[51:29] authority, with a man of power, with a
[51:31] man who overcomes all
[51:34] the infirmities of our lives.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; So you see brothers and sisters, all of
[51:39] us had to have a day when we were born
[51:41] into this world. We call it a birth day.
[51:44] We all have a day that we were born. But
[51:47] along the journey of life that is when
[51:49] we discover what we were born to do.
[51:52] It's along this journey is what we we
[51:55] decide or we discover what we were born
[51:57] for. It's along this road of life where
[52:00] we fall and we get back up and we fall
[52:03] and we get back up and we fall.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; And we get back up. It's in those times
[52:10] that we find out what our calling is.
[52:14] And we see Joshua here being this big
[52:17] chief warrior that he was. He draws his
[52:20] sword upon this man.
[52:23] Now, put yourself in this image. You
[52:26] just stand up and you walk up and you
[52:27] look into a man that you see authority
[52:29] like you've never seen. You see power
[52:31] like you've never seen. You see a man
[52:33] who's got who's got confidence like
[52:35] you've never seen before. And you're
[52:37] going to walk up to him and draw your
[52:39] sword.
[52:42] And he walks up and he draws his sword
[52:44] and he pulls it out and he says, "Who
[52:46] are you?
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Are you for us or are you against us?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Do you stand with Israel or do you stand
[52:54] against us?"
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Now, I can imagine this man looks back
[52:57] at him with a little smirk on his face
[53:01] and he goes
[53:04] and he towers his sword over the top of
[53:07] Joshua's head. And as he towers his his
[53:11] sword up over there and lifts it high
[53:12] above his head, he says, "No, I am the
[53:16] captain of the host of the Lord God of
[53:19] all of Israel. Know now who you're
[53:22] looking for, Joshua. Know now who you're
[53:25] talking to. Know now whose presence you
[53:28] stand in."
[53:31] &gt;&gt; And immediately,
[53:33] go read. Immediately Joshua unlatches
[53:36] the laces off of his shoes and he falls
[53:38] down on his face and he falls on his
[53:41] face before him and says, "What would my
[53:43] Lord have me to do?"
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, so many times we need to get that in
[53:50] our lives where we fall down and say,
[53:51] "What would my Lord have me to do?
[53:56] &gt;&gt; I only want to do, brother Ber, what he
[53:58] wants me to do. I only want to do and
[54:00] say and go and act how he wants me to
[54:03] act.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; And so that's where we fail so many
[54:08] times, brothers and sisters, is we get
[54:09] wrapped up in doing what we want to do.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; We get wrapped up in doing what we want
[54:18] to do. We get wrapped up in our jobs.
[54:21] We get wrapped up in in our friends.
[54:26] We get wrapped up in our children.
[54:32] Well, some of you believe me. Some of
[54:34] you living it. Some of you doing it.
[54:35] Some of you's done it.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; We get wrapped up in our children. Do
[54:41] you know we can even get so wrapped up
[54:43] in our spouses.
[54:48] Some of you's careful to say amen on
[54:50] that one. Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; But we get so wrapped up in our spouses
[54:57] that we get so wrapped up in life
[55:00] that we fail to loosen the shoes on our
[55:03] feet and fall on our faces before God
[55:05] and say, "My Lord, how would you have me
[55:09] to live?
[55:11] Not my life."
[55:15] &gt;&gt; We're talking about priorities.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; We're talking about priorities. We what
[55:20] what did we have first in 2025? And what
[55:23] will we have first in 2026?
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, how would you have me to live? I
[55:29] fall before you. You see, there's a
[55:31] saying that goes like this. If you say
[55:33] yes to everything, you're saying no to
[55:36] something.
[55:37] Think about that. If you say yes to
[55:40] everything your children want, I want to
[55:42] go here, daddy. I want to go this. I
[55:43] want to do that. I want to be a part of
[55:45] this. But it'll take us out of church.
[55:48] You said yes to your kids and no to God.
[55:52] I want a new job. This job that they've
[55:54] been offered is going to give me this
[55:55] big amount of money, but I'm going to
[55:57] have to be gone three weeks out of four.
[55:59] You've said yes to a career and you've
[56:01] said no to God.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Honey, I don't want to go to that church
[56:11] anymore. I want to go over here. But you
[56:12] know, we can't be consistent if we go
[56:14] there because it's too far of a drive.
[56:15] You've said yes to honey and no to God.
[56:20] Well, somebody help me.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; If you say yes to everything, you're
[56:27] saying no to something. And the prophet
[56:29] said that Joshua when Joshua was on his
[56:33] face is when he was finding out his
[56:37] position.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; It wasn't when he was saying under the
[56:43] wings of Moses.
[56:45] Oh, we think that we listen to that and
[56:47] we we hear the stories and we know he
[56:49] was right there as his right-hand man.
[56:50] But that is not when he found out his
[56:52] position.
[56:54] He found out his position when he fell
[56:56] on his face and said, "Lord, what would
[56:58] you have me to do?"
[57:04] It was on his face when he found out who
[57:07] he was.
[57:09] It was on his face
[57:12] on the dirt when he found out what the
[57:14] mission plan was. It was on his face
[57:17] when he found out what he was born to
[57:19] do. On his face, he learned to trust in
[57:22] God.
[57:25] We don't like these days.
[57:27] We don't like to be on our face.
[57:31] We like to see what's coming.
[57:34] But it was on his face that he learned
[57:36] how to lead through adversities.
[57:39] Brothers and sisters, you realize that
[57:41] Joshua being one of the greatest
[57:42] military men that had ever been on the
[57:44] face of the earth, the prophet said
[57:45] there was never a general that could
[57:48] compare to the likes of Joshua. At no
[57:51] time, at no age, nowhere has there ever
[57:54] been anybody compared to the military
[57:57] might that Joshua was.
[58:03] You say, "Well, Trump just went in and
[58:04] got that guy." I don't care what Donald
[58:06] Trump just did.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Well, he's going to take care of Iraq. I
[58:10] don't care what he's going to do. There
[58:12] was never anybody, no commander ever
[58:14] was, ever will be, ever, that will line
[58:17] up with the might of Joshua.
[58:24] You see that word Joshua, it comes from
[58:26] another word, another a word we know
[58:28] very well means Jesus. It means Jesus.
[58:31] It means savior. It means deliverer. But
[58:34] what I want us to realize tonight that
[58:36] even in all of his glory,
[58:39] we hear about the stories of Joshua and
[58:40] we hear about all they overcoming this
[58:42] and he overcome that and the walls came
[58:44] down and this. But in all of his glory,
[58:46] what I want you to realize tonight, in
[58:49] all of his might, Joshua was not
[58:51] perfect.
[58:54] He was not perfect at all in any of his
[58:57] actions. But Joshua longed for
[59:00] perfection. We talked about it. Brother
[59:01] Ber mentioned it this morning. How many
[59:03] wants to be perfect?
[59:05] Joshua longed for perfection. But as a
[59:08] man, he was not perfected. As a man, he
[59:12] was not perfect. In a as a man, he
[59:14] failed many times after many times after
[59:16] many times. And no doubt he wanted to do
[59:20] exactly what God wanted him to do. His
[59:24] desire was to be obedient. That's all of
[59:27] our desires. We all want to be obedient
[59:29] to the word of God and what God wants us
[59:31] to do. But he was a man just like you
[59:34] and just like I
[59:37] &gt;&gt; H
[59:39] plenty of faults. When we look at
[59:41] Joshua, we look at his faults, we see he
[59:44] failed many, many times and and he knew
[59:48] what discouragement was all about.
[59:53] Now, we don't think about that a lot.
[59:56] If I say Joshua, you think great
[59:58] warrior. If I say Joshua, you think
[59:59] overcomer. If I say Joshua, you say
[1:00:01] walls come down. If I say Joshua, you
[1:00:03] think big grapes carrying them back,
[1:00:06] overcoming promised land.
[1:00:08] We don't think about the Joshua that was
[1:00:10] disobedient.
[1:00:12] We don't think about the Joshua who got
[1:00:14] the big head.
[1:00:16] Oh, well, you you don't you don't
[1:00:17] believe me? Some of you looking at me
[1:00:20] like a a cow staring at a new gate.
[1:00:23] But that's what the word says when we go
[1:00:26] in here and look, we see what Joshua's
[1:00:28] most significant weakness occurring over
[1:00:30] and over and over was his ability to
[1:00:33] make major decisions based on his own
[1:00:36] judgment, his ideas. He wanted to
[1:00:40] conquer the world
[1:00:42] the way he wanted to conquer the world.
[1:00:48] You want this?
[1:00:57] You won't conquer a thing in yourself.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; You got enemies.
[1:01:07] You got fears. You got doubts. You got
[1:01:09] anxieties. You got you got oppressions.
[1:01:11] You've got habits. You've got things
[1:01:13] that you just can't overcome. You've got
[1:01:15] enemies in your life. And you say, "I
[1:01:17] want to conquer it, but I'm going to do
[1:01:18] it this way.
[1:01:22] You're setting yourself up for a long
[1:01:25] hard winter.
[1:01:30] Joshua,
[1:01:32] he begins to rely on himself.
[1:01:35] In the blink of an eye, Joshua goes from
[1:01:38] zero to hero.
[1:01:43] Think about it.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; He goes from zero, nothing. hadn't done
[1:01:47] anything
[1:01:49] to hero. All of a sudden, he begins to
[1:01:52] he all of a sudden the miraculous thing
[1:01:55] happens at Jericho. He goes up and he
[1:01:57] tries to tell the people. He begins to
[1:01:59] tell the people if we do this and we do
[1:02:00] this and we follow this and we go here
[1:02:02] and we do this and we shout and we walk
[1:02:04] and we march and we take the ark before
[1:02:07] us, the walls will come down. And what
[1:02:10] happened?
[1:02:12] The walls came tumbling down.
[1:02:16] Fast forward a few days.
[1:02:21] What did you Did y'all quit reading
[1:02:22] right there?
[1:02:26] The story doesn't end there. No. Joshua
[1:02:29] begins to look and he says, "Who's next
[1:02:31] on the list?" After the walls of Jericho
[1:02:33] coming down, Joshua begins to get the
[1:02:35] big head. Look in chapter 7 of Joshua.
[1:02:38] They suffer a great defeat of a city
[1:02:40] called I.
[1:02:44] The walls of Jericho came down.
[1:02:48] Maybe it was your enemy one day that
[1:02:50] came down.
[1:02:52] You said, "Oh, I praise God. I did it.
[1:02:59] I have overcome depression.
[1:03:04] I have overcome oppression.
[1:03:07] I have overcome smoking. I have overcome
[1:03:10] drinking.
[1:03:20] The walls came down and Joshua looks
[1:03:24] around and says, "Ah, look at this. This
[1:03:27] is what I was called for.
[1:03:29] I'm living the promise of my hour. I
[1:03:33] brought the walls down."
[1:03:38] H
[1:03:40] brothers and sisters, humility went out
[1:03:42] the door.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Humility went out the door. Brother Ber
[1:03:46] said this morning, we got to stay
[1:03:47] humble.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; We got to stay humble. I didn't know
[1:03:50] what he was preaching. He didn't know
[1:03:51] what I was preaching. But I do know
[1:03:53] this. If you're going to go anywhere
[1:03:54] with God, you better stay humble before
[1:03:56] God. You better give credit where credit
[1:03:59] is due.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; And here is Joshua. He comes down here
[1:04:03] and he looks and he says, "Oh, I don't
[1:04:06] need
[1:04:07] to counsel God anymore."
[1:04:14] Have y'all read this story,
[1:04:18] Brother Joe? You read this story.
[1:04:21] Just shake your head.
[1:04:28] I don't need counsel anymore because I
[1:04:31] had this great victory at Jericho and I
[1:04:33] know what I'm doing now. I know how to
[1:04:35] go forward. I know. But what he failed
[1:04:38] to realize, what he failed to remember
[1:04:40] is his big victory at Jericho was not
[1:04:42] anything he done. He simply followed
[1:04:45] instruction.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; What God told him to do, he told them to
[1:04:49] do.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; It wasn't because he was great. It
[1:04:52] wasn't because the warriors were great.
[1:04:54] It was because they simply followed
[1:04:56] instruction.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; If you want to overcome things in your
[1:04:59] life, follow the way God said do it.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; If you want to get closer to God, what
[1:05:05] do you do?
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; See, I don't have to tell you that. I
[1:05:09] don't have to preach that to you. You
[1:05:10] know what to do.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; And Joshua looks out here and he says,
[1:05:16] "Who's next? Who's next on the list? Who
[1:05:19] shall we destroy today?
[1:05:22] I
[1:05:23] I Joshua is the next city in the way.
[1:05:27] Where is I? Who is I? How big is I? And
[1:05:32] Joshua begins to send the the men of
[1:05:34] Jericho down to the city of I. And he
[1:05:35] says, "Go down there into the country
[1:05:37] and I want you to look and tell me about
[1:05:39] this city I."
[1:05:43] And the men come back and they go down
[1:05:45] or they go down there and they begin to
[1:05:46] look at the city. They begin to survey
[1:05:48] it all out and they go down there and
[1:05:50] they come back and they tell him,
[1:05:51] "Joshua,
[1:05:53] there's no need in sending many people
[1:05:55] up there.
[1:05:57] There's no need in sending a bunch of
[1:05:58] people up there. Let the people rest. We
[1:06:00] can just send about 3,000 men up there.
[1:06:03] Didn't you see what we did to that city
[1:06:05] of Jericho? 3,000 of our men can take
[1:06:07] this little town out with no problem."
[1:06:11] And Joshua says,
[1:06:13] "Okay,
[1:06:15] sounds good.
[1:06:18] Let's do it.
[1:06:20] In the Bible, nowhere it says does it
[1:06:23] say he talked to God about it. Nowhere
[1:06:27] in the Bible does it say he prayed about
[1:06:28] it. Nowhere in the Bible does it say he
[1:06:31] he he got himself before God and fell
[1:06:33] before God and said, "God, how should we
[1:06:35] handle this?" But he said, "I'll take it
[1:06:37] upon ourselves. We'll take our men and
[1:06:39] we'll go down there." And there was
[1:06:41] about 12,000 men in the city of I. And
[1:06:45] they go down there. We s Josh Joshua
[1:06:46] sends 3,000 men and the men of I run
[1:06:49] them out of the city the gates and kill
[1:06:51] 36 of God's men.
[1:06:57] Yeah. Brothers and sisters, now the
[1:07:00] people's hearts, the Bible says that the
[1:07:02] heart of the people melted and it became
[1:07:03] as water.
[1:07:06] These are the same people that I thought
[1:07:08] was victorious. These are the same
[1:07:10] people I thought that was right there at
[1:07:12] the city of the walls of Jericho came
[1:07:13] down and they shouted and they danced
[1:07:15] and they screamed and they praised God
[1:07:17] and thank God for all that he's done.
[1:07:20] And now it says that their their their
[1:07:22] very hearts had melted and became his
[1:07:24] water. So now, brothers and sisters,
[1:07:26] here they stand defeated. A once
[1:07:28] victorious army now lays before their
[1:07:31] own people defeated.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; No more shout,
[1:07:37] no more victory.
[1:07:43] All because they overcome one enemy
[1:07:47] and failed to give God the praise.
[1:07:51] Come on, church. And failed to give God
[1:07:54] the glory.
[1:07:57] Now the little enemies are starting to
[1:08:00] build up.
[1:08:01] Jericho was a big place.
[1:08:05] They took it down pretty easily with the
[1:08:07] word of God.
[1:08:10] But in man's eyes, in man's might, in
[1:08:13] man's will and way, they can't even
[1:08:16] overcome a little bitty city maybe the
[1:08:18] size of Elton.
[1:08:21] And the Bible tells us that Joshua now
[1:08:23] rinse his clothes. And Joshua rinse his
[1:08:27] clothes and he falls on the his face
[1:08:29] before the ark of the Lord. Now watch
[1:08:31] what Joshua does. This is just the human
[1:08:33] nature. This is the way we all will
[1:08:34] react. And Joshua comes down. He says,
[1:08:37] "Ah Lord God, why hast thou?
[1:08:45] Why hast thou brought us people, the
[1:08:48] people over the River Jordan to deliver
[1:08:50] us into the hand of the Amorites and
[1:08:51] destroy us?"
[1:08:54] So now Joshua is blaming God.
[1:08:58] It's your fault. Listen, God, it's your
[1:09:01] fault. You're the one who done this. You
[1:09:03] let this happen. You brought us over
[1:09:05] here.
[1:09:09] Are you with me?
[1:09:12] And Joshua goes on to say, "What to God?
[1:09:14] We'd have been content to dwell on the
[1:09:16] other side, Lord. We would have been
[1:09:17] happy to dwell on the outskirts of the
[1:09:19] Jordan, but here you are. You made us
[1:09:21] all of these promises. You told us all
[1:09:24] about this land with milk and honey. You
[1:09:26] told us about all these deliverers we
[1:09:28] all the deliverance we could have. You
[1:09:30] told us about all this overcoming power.
[1:09:32] You told us that all things could be
[1:09:34] ours and whatever we ask would be in our
[1:09:36] hands.
[1:09:40] You told us that we would live a life of
[1:09:44] plenty.
[1:09:46] Huh? Lord, but this is hard. We can't do
[1:09:49] this, Lord. Now, everyone knows how weak
[1:09:51] we are and they're going to war against
[1:09:52] us. Look at us now, Lord. We lay here
[1:09:55] defeated. Lord, you broke your promise.
[1:10:00] Can you imagine the good things that God
[1:10:03] has done in our lives? The good things
[1:10:06] that God has done in our lives. And then
[1:10:08] we fail to realize, we fail to praise.
[1:10:10] We fail to give God glory. And all of a
[1:10:12] sudden, we stand defeated because we
[1:10:14] can't even get over a toothache.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; I promise we're going to get on the
[1:10:25] victorious side in a minute.
[1:10:31] Because I tell you what, God don't bring
[1:10:33] us this far to lose us.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; God will never bring you to a place and
[1:10:39] say, "Oh, you've you've accomplished all
[1:10:40] you can in the word and now it's done
[1:10:43] here." God does not put a period after
[1:10:46] his promises.
[1:10:47] But we keep growing. We keep growing. We
[1:10:49] keep developing. We keep maturing. Thank
[1:10:52] God.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; We keep getting better and better in
[1:10:55] God. But see, but Joshua let self get in
[1:10:59] the way. He let self get in the way. And
[1:11:02] the victory that came at Jericho was all
[1:11:04] forgotten about.
[1:11:11] Let me ask you, what was your victory
[1:11:14] 15 years ago on this date?
[1:11:19] You see what I mean?
[1:11:21] How quick, how quick we fail to remember
[1:11:25] all the goodness of God. How quick we
[1:11:28] fail to realize that all the good things
[1:11:30] in our life come from him. 2025 was a
[1:11:34] good year because this church put God
[1:11:37] first. If you want 2026 to be a good
[1:11:40] year in your home, in your job, in your
[1:11:43] life, in your children, in our church,
[1:11:45] put God first.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Joshua's sitting here wallering around
[1:11:56] like a hog in the waller, crying,
[1:11:59] pouting, whining. And the Lord looks at
[1:12:01] Joshua and he says, "Get up."
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Get thee up. Wherefore lies thou up on
[1:12:08] thy face?
[1:12:12] Listen to me. Follow me. He said, "Take
[1:12:14] counsel from me. Get up. Quit laying
[1:12:18] around. Quit trying to do things your
[1:12:19] way. Quit trying to do things the way
[1:12:21] you want to do it and listen to me.
[1:12:23] Follow me. Put me first in the battles.
[1:12:25] Let me go before you. You crossed the
[1:12:28] river when the ark went first.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we just have to be
[1:12:34] reminded.
[1:12:36] Joshua kind of had to be reminded.
[1:12:38] Joshua, don't you remember that big
[1:12:40] bunch of grapes that you brought back on
[1:12:42] your back for the evidence?
[1:12:44] Don't you remember Joshua marching down
[1:12:47] there with those grapes on your soldiers
[1:12:49] on your shoulder soul shoulders singing
[1:12:52] uh the songs of Jubilee? Don't you
[1:12:55] remember going down there and singing we
[1:12:57] are able to go up and take the country
[1:13:02] to possess the land from Jordan to the
[1:13:05] sea.
[1:13:07] Though the giants may be in our way to
[1:13:10] hinder,
[1:13:12] our God has promised us the what?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Victory.
[1:13:20] [applause]
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; God said, "Remember who you are, Joshua.
[1:13:25] Remember what you were born to do.
[1:13:27] Remember the day that you were born and
[1:13:29] remember the day that you fell on your
[1:13:31] face and I told you what you were born
[1:13:33] to do.
[1:13:38] You see, just because we fall, just
[1:13:40] because we fall today don't mean we're
[1:13:42] lost tomorrow. Just because we're
[1:13:44] defeated today doesn't mean you that
[1:13:46] that you allow the devil to steal your
[1:13:47] victory. Because tough times makes tough
[1:13:50] people. And tough times never last, but
[1:13:53] tough people do.
[1:13:59] Everywhere
[1:14:01] the souls of your feet trod, you shall
[1:14:06] possess it. I'm going to change gears
[1:14:09] here for just a little bit. I'm going to
[1:14:10] share some stories with you, some
[1:14:12] modernday stories of overcoming power.
[1:14:15] There was a man, a gentleman by the name
[1:14:17] of Richard Norris William II,
[1:14:20] born in 1891.
[1:14:22] Norris Williams was an American tennis
[1:14:24] player. At the age of 12, he began to
[1:14:27] start playing tennis. He began to get
[1:14:29] direction under his dad. He began to
[1:14:31] excel in tennis.
[1:14:33] You say, "What's this got to do with
[1:14:35] Joshua?"
[1:14:36] He had to realize who he was. He had to
[1:14:39] realize exactly what he would what he
[1:14:42] was called to do and how he would have
[1:14:44] to overcome obstacle after obstacle
[1:14:46] after obstacle.
[1:14:48] Norris Williams and his father in the in
[1:14:50] the month of April of 1912. Does that
[1:14:52] name does that date and that month sound
[1:14:54] familiar to any of you? They boarded a
[1:14:57] ship called the Titanic.
[1:15:01] Norris Williams and his dad boarded a
[1:15:03] ship called the the Titanic. And as they
[1:15:05] sailing across the sea, we know the
[1:15:07] story. The Titanic hit the iceberg. The
[1:15:09] iceberg pierced the side. The Titanic
[1:15:11] began its final plunge.
[1:15:14] As the ship begins to go down, Norris
[1:15:17] Williams is going through the bunkheads
[1:15:19] of the of the ship there. And he sees
[1:15:21] people locked behind doors. He breaks
[1:15:24] down the doors
[1:15:26] and releases those people to their
[1:15:28] freedom.
[1:15:30] One of the stewards on there said, "You
[1:15:32] will be charged for this.
[1:15:35] You're going to have to pay for this."
[1:15:37] Very familiar scene in the story in the
[1:15:40] movie Titanic.
[1:15:42] That was Richard or that was Norris
[1:15:44] Williams that they were talking about.
[1:15:47] As Williams gets on the Titanic and he
[1:15:49] begins to him and his father they jump
[1:15:50] and they bail off of the ship of the
[1:15:52] Titanic and they enter into the icy sea.
[1:15:55] Him and his father's out there and in
[1:15:57] just a moment one of the smoke stacks
[1:15:59] begins to come tumbling down and it
[1:16:01] falls and lands right on his father
[1:16:05] and he sits there and he begins to look
[1:16:07] at this and he said, "I saw one of those
[1:16:08] great funnels come crashing down on top
[1:16:11] of him and just for an instance I stood
[1:16:13] there transfixed.
[1:16:15] I stood there as I saw it crashing down.
[1:16:18] Not because it had missed me by a few
[1:16:20] feet, but curiously and not because it
[1:16:22] had killed my father, but because of the
[1:16:25] I was transfixed of the enormous size of
[1:16:28] this funnel, still belching smoke. He
[1:16:31] said, "It seemed as two cars could have
[1:16:33] driven side by side in it as it made its
[1:16:35] way to me."
[1:16:39] He struggles to swim in the icy sea.
[1:16:42] Finally, he grabs a hold of a lifeboat.
[1:16:46] And for hours,
[1:16:48] after grabbing a hold of the lifeboat,
[1:16:50] no room for him inside the boat. He
[1:16:52] hangs on over the edge. And for hours
[1:16:54] and hours, his legs are left out there
[1:16:56] into the freezing waters.
[1:17:00] Finally, a ship, the Carpathia, arrives.
[1:17:04] The Carpathia comes and arrives and and
[1:17:07] comes and picks up all the survivors.
[1:17:08] and they're they're going through there
[1:17:10] and they're they're pulling them in and
[1:17:11] they call him in and they say, "Listen,
[1:17:13] your legs are so severely frostbitten.
[1:17:18] You will never walk again."
[1:17:27] Footsteps means possession.
[1:17:31] Think about this. You will never walk
[1:17:34] again. It is an absolute must that we
[1:17:37] amputate your legs.
[1:17:40] He said, "No,
[1:17:43] I'm going to walk."
[1:17:45] And day after day, he would take a step
[1:17:49] wobbling on his legs so severely
[1:17:52] frostbitten, black and and rotten and
[1:17:55] looked like appeared to be rotten in a
[1:17:56] way. And he would take a step and a
[1:17:58] little step here and a little step there
[1:18:00] and another little step and another
[1:18:02] little step. And he began to possess
[1:18:04] He began to walk and he began to
[1:18:06] possess. Are you with me? The doctor
[1:18:09] said, "You'll never walk. We have to
[1:18:10] amputate." That's what Satan wants to do
[1:18:13] sometimes. He'll tell you, "You can't
[1:18:15] have your victory. You just might as
[1:18:17] well cut it off right now."
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; And Satan wants to amputate what God has
[1:18:22] already given you. This man was a
[1:18:24] God-gifted, talented tennis playing
[1:18:27] athlete.
[1:18:32] Don't cut my legs off.
[1:18:35] And he walks step after step after step.
[1:18:47] Did you think he ever played tennis
[1:18:49] again?
[1:18:55] 1912,
[1:18:59] not soon after the accident, after the
[1:19:01] Titanic sinks, and after he begins to
[1:19:03] regain his strength, after he begins to
[1:19:05] take step after step after step, and he
[1:19:07] says, "I was born to play tennis. I was
[1:19:10] born to live this kind of life. We were
[1:19:12] born to be Christians. We were born to
[1:19:15] possess the gates of our enemy. We were
[1:19:17] born to be overcomers."
[1:19:20] This man begins to take these steps and
[1:19:22] in the same year of 1912 he defeated
[1:19:25] eighttime champion Wallace Johnson and
[1:19:28] he began to win again in 1914.
[1:19:31] He became a multiple time multiple time
[1:19:34] multiple time tennis champion.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not listening to the devil
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; this year. I'm not listening to the
[1:19:45] devil. When he says I you can't have
[1:19:48] this, I'm going to say you watch me go
[1:19:50] get it. When he tells me I can't have
[1:19:53] victory, when he tells me I I can't have
[1:19:55] uh happiness in my life, I'm going to
[1:19:57] say, "Devil, you watch me. I'm going to
[1:19:58] go get it."
[1:20:05] at the age of uh at the age of 33 in the
[1:20:09] 1924 Olympics.
[1:20:12] He's playing in a tennis match and he
[1:20:14] severely sprains his ankle.
[1:20:18] They tell him say, "You're going to have
[1:20:19] to withdraw from the match. You're going
[1:20:21] to do more damage than if you were to
[1:20:23] get out. Just just get out. You're going
[1:20:24] to do more damage. You're going to hurt
[1:20:26] yourself more." He says, "I'm not going
[1:20:27] to stop playing tennis. just over a
[1:20:29] little sprained ankle. And he began to
[1:20:32] keep going and he began going and he won
[1:20:34] the gold medal in the mixed doubles on a
[1:20:37] severely sprained ankle.
[1:20:40] He knew what he was born to do. And you
[1:20:42] say, "Well, that's a tennis player. How
[1:20:44] much more should it apply to us as
[1:20:46] Christians?
[1:20:48] How much more victorious should we be?
[1:20:51] We shouldn't let a little hurt feeling
[1:20:52] keep us out of church. We shouldn't let
[1:20:54] a little poor attitude keep us out of
[1:20:56] church.
[1:21:05] She was born prematurely at 4 lb and 5
[1:21:09] oz in the summer of 1940
[1:21:13] in St. Bethlehem, Tennessee.
[1:21:16] Many of you drive daily down a road
[1:21:18] that's named after her.
[1:21:21] You ever heard of Wilma Rudolph?
[1:21:24] Wilma Rudolph was born. She had several
[1:21:26] childhood illnesses. She had pneumonia.
[1:21:28] She had scarlet fever. She had contacted
[1:21:31] infantile paral paralyzis
[1:21:34] caused by polio virus.
[1:21:38] Her legs were in braces most of her
[1:21:40] life. They said she would never walk
[1:21:43] again.
[1:21:45] Think about this. They said she would
[1:21:48] never walk again. She would be
[1:21:50] physically disabled much of her life.
[1:21:52] Leg brace. 12 years old in leg braces.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; medical facilities wouldn't take care of
[1:21:59] African-American black black people at
[1:22:01] that time in the 1940s.
[1:22:05] So there she was.
[1:22:08] She knew who she was, but what was she
[1:22:11] born to do?
[1:22:15] You mean to tell me this young little
[1:22:17] girl who has who has par paralysis in
[1:22:19] the legs? A young little girl who's
[1:22:21] wearing braces. You mean to tell me she
[1:22:23] was born to run?
[1:22:27] It don't make sense.
[1:22:31] But she knew who she was. She loved
[1:22:33] basketball. She loved track and field.
[1:22:35] She loved to do all those things. And
[1:22:37] she began to little by little her
[1:22:40] parents would take her all the way to
[1:22:41] Nashville to a hospital that would take
[1:22:43] care of black people.
[1:22:45] black children.
[1:22:47] They would come home and they would
[1:22:48] spend two or three trips a week to go to
[1:22:50] Nashville and they would prescribe her
[1:22:52] therapy and massage her legs and massage
[1:22:54] her legs and say, "Walk a little more.
[1:22:57] Walk a little more. Possess what you
[1:22:58] want."
[1:23:00] Come on, church. We need to exercise
[1:23:02] some of our muscles.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we set paralyzed in church,
[1:23:07] not willing to take a step or make a
[1:23:09] move.
[1:23:13] take another step, make another move.
[1:23:16] And they begin to massage her legs and
[1:23:18] massage her legs. And week after week
[1:23:20] after week, she began to take these
[1:23:22] treatments.
[1:23:29] The head coach
[1:23:32] of Temple
[1:23:34] seen her playing basketball as a 14y old
[1:23:38] two years after she's in leg braces.
[1:23:43] and he looked at her and instantly said,
[1:23:46] "That girl was a born athlete."
[1:23:54] He invited her to come to the summer
[1:23:56] program at Tennessee State. He invited
[1:23:58] her to come to the track camp. And there
[1:24:01] as a 14-year-old, she won all nine
[1:24:03] events in the amateur athletic union,
[1:24:05] the AAU events. She won all nine events.
[1:24:09] and she went to Pennsylvania,
[1:24:10] Philadelphia, Pennsylvania under his
[1:24:12] guidance and she began to run with the
[1:24:14] track team. She was then invited to go
[1:24:16] to the 1956 Olympics as a 16year-old
[1:24:22] girl
[1:24:23] who four years earlier was embraces.
[1:24:29] Sometimes we let our complexes hold us
[1:24:31] back. We allow our complexes to hold us
[1:24:35] back. we allowed them to keep us from
[1:24:37] doing the things that we were called to
[1:24:39] do.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; What if What if the preachers allowed
[1:24:42] the complex of be getting up in front of
[1:24:44] people? What if they allowed that
[1:24:46] complex to hold them back and not do
[1:24:48] what they were told to do?
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; What if you allowed the complex of
[1:24:53] getting up in front of people and not
[1:24:54] singing
[1:25:00] kept you from doing what God called you
[1:25:03] to do?
[1:25:05] She began to run and she began to run
[1:25:07] and she began to run over and over and
[1:25:09] over. She won medal after medal after
[1:25:11] medal. Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold.
[1:25:17] She's become one of the She is the most
[1:25:19] one of the most decorated females in
[1:25:21] Olympic track history.
[1:25:25] Statues have been made after her.
[1:25:27] Buildings have been named after her.
[1:25:29] University coliseums have been named
[1:25:32] after her.
[1:25:34] How could that happen? How could some
[1:25:36] little teenage girl who had so many
[1:25:38] setbacks and become a household name?
[1:25:40] Because she stood on the promises of
[1:25:42] what she was, of what God made her to
[1:25:45] be. Some of us need to accept what God
[1:25:48] wants us to do in our hour and in our
[1:25:50] lives.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, why is this church here
[1:25:55] so much on fire?
[1:25:58] because a few
[1:26:00] because a few decided to take a stand
[1:26:02] and do what God called them to do.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; You know, I I hate to call people out,
[1:26:12] but I like to give roses where roses are
[1:26:14] due.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; We listen to the testimony of Brother
[1:26:19] Tommy.
[1:26:22] Jo, she said, "I'm glad you got Tommy."
[1:26:24] I said, "I am too." Tommy texts me about
[1:26:27] every day, sends me pictures of his
[1:26:30] breakfast,
[1:26:31] his lunch,
[1:26:35] his supper.
[1:26:38] He sent me a plate of food last night.
[1:26:41] Uh, steak, potatoes, beans. I don't know
[1:26:44] what I was on. I said, "Man, that ain't
[1:26:45] right." I said, "I just ate peanut
[1:26:47] butter and crackers."
[1:26:53] And you say, "Well, y'all sure talk a
[1:26:54] lot about Tommy." Well, let me tell you
[1:26:55] about Tommy. Tommy has taken and and
[1:26:57] became and got a boldness in his heart.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; And he's be to take that boldness that
[1:27:02] God called him with, and he's be to take
[1:27:04] that boldness and he shares it out into
[1:27:06] the out into the community. He takes it
[1:27:08] into the prisons. Now, he didn't do it
[1:27:10] all by himself. Now, he's got a team.
[1:27:13] He's be
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; And good things are happening.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Good things are coming of it. But let me
[1:27:22] tell you this, maybe he won't tell you,
[1:27:24] but there was a time he told me. He
[1:27:26] said, I'm I'm quitting this. Am I right?
[1:27:29] He said, I I don't have no nobody comes.
[1:27:31] No, there's no outcome. People are
[1:27:33] starting to dwindle away at the prison.
[1:27:35] We started out with several, but then
[1:27:36] last time it was about just a few, maybe
[1:27:38] six or seven.
[1:27:40] This is my last day.
[1:27:44] Let's don't tell God what we're going to
[1:27:46] do.
[1:27:49] Let's say, God, is this my last day?
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Because he shows up at the prison on his
[1:27:56] last day when he's fixing to announce,
[1:27:58] "I'm done with this. We're not coming
[1:27:59] back." And how many was there? 20
[1:28:01] something. 30. 21. Thank you, brother
[1:28:04] Glenn.
[1:28:06] 21 shows up, the biggest crowd they've
[1:28:08] had. And they they show up there, 21 of
[1:28:10] them. And he says, "I'll see y'all next
[1:28:12] week." [clears throat]
[1:28:16] 21 of them. [applause] They pray
[1:28:19] together, they sing together, they talk
[1:28:21] about the word, they bring in the Lord.
[1:28:23] Now, the prison won't let him come in
[1:28:24] and bring in message,
[1:28:27] but God has given him a gift and he can
[1:28:30] recall.
[1:28:32] I said, "Man, I wish I could recall like
[1:28:34] Tommy." He gets to preach it to me. I
[1:28:36] said, "Man, won't you here? Just take
[1:28:38] this and go."
[1:28:44] And that little fire spread here and
[1:28:48] here and there and there and there and
[1:28:53] there.
[1:28:57] We got a group of people that's in
[1:28:59] action. We got a group of people that is
[1:29:02] allowing God to move into their lives.
[1:29:04] That's how it happens. You got to stand
[1:29:06] on what you know that God is doing in
[1:29:08] your life.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Use me, oh Lord. Lord, what would you
[1:29:12] have me to do?
[1:29:15] Be a Joshua.
[1:29:17] Be a Joshua.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're not a Tommy. Maybe you're
[1:29:20] not a Maybe you're not a brother Thomas.
[1:29:22] Maybe you're not a brother Brad. Maybe
[1:29:23] you're not Maybe you're not a singer.
[1:29:24] Maybe you're not this. But what has God
[1:29:26] called you to do?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; You see, you can have a job. You can
[1:29:30] make the most money than anybody in this
[1:29:32] building. But if you're not doing what
[1:29:33] God wants you to do, it's all in vain.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Your money means nothing to God. Do you
[1:29:39] know that?
[1:29:43] He doesn't need it.
[1:29:47] He don't want your money. He wants your
[1:29:49] heart.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; He wants a living vessel, somebody that
[1:29:52] he can use, somebody that he can move
[1:29:54] through.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; And sometimes the avenues we have to
[1:29:57] take to get there is not always a fun
[1:29:59] way. It's not always a fun road.
[1:30:03] April the 17th, 2018,
[1:30:06] Southwest Flight 1380
[1:30:09] was climbing towards cruising altitude
[1:30:11] when the left engine detonated with such
[1:30:14] a force that the captain Tammy Joe
[1:30:16] Schultz thought they collided with
[1:30:18] another aircraft.
[1:30:22] Metal shrapnel gum. It pierces through
[1:30:24] the fuselage. The window seat 14A
[1:30:27] exploded. The cabin depressurized. One
[1:30:29] of the passengers was pulled out of the
[1:30:31] opening and the others grabs a hold of
[1:30:34] her and begins to pull her back in.
[1:30:36] Oxygen mass drop. This is our worst
[1:30:38] nightmare when we get on a plane, right?
[1:30:42] The oxygen mass drop.
[1:30:44] They drop down there and the plane rolls
[1:30:46] violently and it pitched into a dive and
[1:30:49] smoke begins to fill the cockpit.
[1:30:51] Passengers are now terrified and they're
[1:30:53] typing their final messages out to their
[1:30:55] families.
[1:30:57] Chaos
[1:30:58] in the sky.
[1:31:00] Tammy Joe Schultz picks up the radio.
[1:31:04] Captain Schultz in a calm voice says,
[1:31:07] "This is Southwest.
[1:31:10] This is Southwest 1380.
[1:31:14] We're a single engine.
[1:31:22] We're a single engine and we have part
[1:31:24] of the aircraft missing. So, we're going
[1:31:26] to need to slow down a bit.
[1:31:30] That's her quote. This is air traffic
[1:31:33] control documented communication. We've
[1:31:35] lost part of our airplane. We're going
[1:31:36] to have to slow down just a little bit.
[1:31:39] Air traffic controllers, they couldn't
[1:31:40] believe what they were hearing. While
[1:31:43] 148 people are fighting full of full of
[1:31:45] terror, she's up there flying the
[1:31:48] aircraft.
[1:31:50] She's up there just flying along. what
[1:31:52] they what it seemed impossible.
[1:31:55] It wasn't luck. It wasn't look. She was
[1:31:59] forged through 30 years of being told
[1:32:01] she didn't belong in an airplane.
[1:32:05] Listen to what I'm telling you.
[1:32:08] 30 years she'd been told you don't
[1:32:10] belong in an airplane. For 30 years
[1:32:12] she'd been told women don't fly.
[1:32:17] For 30 years they said women cannot fly
[1:32:20] jets.
[1:32:24] Some of us could say, "For 30 years, the
[1:32:26] devil's told me I can't do this."
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; For 30 years, the devil has told me I
[1:32:30] can't overcome this habit.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; For 30 years, the devil's told me I
[1:32:34] can't quit drinking. For 30 years, the
[1:32:36] devil's told me I can't quit smoking.
[1:32:38] For 30 years, the devil's told me I
[1:32:40] can't stop pornography.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; She goes to aviation school.
[1:32:50] growing up watching the the fighter jets
[1:32:53] over her over her place in New Mexico.
[1:32:55] And she goes to aviation school and she
[1:32:57] shows up at the lecture and she pulls up
[1:33:00] in there and the guy says or she says,
[1:33:03] "I want to be a pilot."
[1:33:06] And he tells her the truth and she says,
[1:33:08] "There are no professional women pilots.
[1:33:11] Girls don't fly jets.
[1:33:13] Military don't want you."
[1:33:17] Huh? Has the devil ever told you God
[1:33:20] don't want you?
[1:33:22] Some of you is honest.
[1:33:24] The devil sometimes tells us these
[1:33:26] things. The Air Force rejected her three
[1:33:29] different times. Navy told her she'd
[1:33:31] never score enough because she wasn't a
[1:33:33] man. Her standards were higher for most
[1:33:35] women, and she took a full year to find
[1:33:37] a recruit willing to submit her
[1:33:39] paperwork because she knew in her heart
[1:33:42] she was good enough.
[1:33:47] You say, "What's this got to do with
[1:33:49] Joshua?"
[1:33:50] It's got a lot to do with Joshua. It's
[1:33:53] about us finding our position. It's
[1:33:54] about us living out the promises of our
[1:33:57] hour.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; She became one of the first women to fly
[1:34:01] an FA18 Hornet in the US Navy.
[1:34:05] You think, man, she's arrived. And
[1:34:06] that's the way we do a lot of times. The
[1:34:08] devil tell you can't do this, you can't
[1:34:09] do that. And the next thing you know,
[1:34:10] you get it, you overcome it, and you
[1:34:12] say, I've arrived.
[1:34:17] her first assignment to hum humiliate
[1:34:19] her.
[1:34:21] Her officer refused to let her teach
[1:34:23] aerial gunnery. You know where they go
[1:34:25] up and they dog fight and they shoot and
[1:34:26] they do the all. You know, you've seen
[1:34:27] it. Some of you seen Top Gun years ago.
[1:34:33] Some of you's in that danger zone.
[1:34:40] But they said you can't do that. So
[1:34:41] here, in order to to re to to humiliate
[1:34:44] her as a as a form of punishment and a
[1:34:47] way to si sideline her, they tell her,
[1:34:49] "For a year, you're going to go teach
[1:34:51] pilots how to recover aircraft from
[1:34:53] spins, dives, and catastrophic failures.
[1:35:02] I want her flying my plane."
[1:35:06] This was a lesson in her life that was
[1:35:09] born from discrimination. This was a
[1:35:11] lesson in her life that would save 148
[1:35:14] lives. When that engine exploded 25
[1:35:18] years later, warning lights flood the
[1:35:20] panel of her plane. Can you imagine the
[1:35:22] the red lights
[1:35:25] and she's descending at 20,000 ft in a
[1:35:28] minute?
[1:35:34] We've lost an air. We've lost an engine.
[1:35:36] We're going to have to slow down a
[1:35:37] little bit.
[1:35:41] She comes in here, one engine gone, the
[1:35:45] fuselage torn open. She lands the plane.
[1:35:50] Medics come down to check her after the
[1:35:52] landing. They check her vital signs and
[1:35:56] they said her vital signs and her heart
[1:35:59] rate were barely elevated.
[1:36:06] You see, sometimes the devil tries to
[1:36:08] humiliate us.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we go through things that
[1:36:13] we think, man, why am I going through
[1:36:15] this? But God has a perfect a a plan.
[1:36:19] God has a purpose and it's a perfect
[1:36:22] purpose and a plan in our lives. It's up
[1:36:25] to us to live the promise that God has
[1:36:28] given us. 148 people. They didn't rush
[1:36:31] her off the airplane. She went from
[1:36:33] passenger to passenger to passenger and
[1:36:36] hugged them and said, "Thank you for
[1:36:38] flying with us today."
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; They probably said, "Hallelujah. Thank
[1:36:47] you for landing us today."
[1:36:54] I'm going to stay true to my word less
[1:36:56] than an hour. I don't think I said that,
[1:36:57] but that's what I was thinking.
[1:37:01] Joshua
[1:37:03] Joshua a leader. Joshua led first in the
[1:37:07] wilderness where there was thousands
[1:37:08] times 10 thousands and thousands of
[1:37:10] noble men. But the prophet said Joshua
[1:37:13] seemed to realize who he was and he
[1:37:17] found out that he was positionally he
[1:37:19] was elected of God.
[1:37:22] Brothers and sisters, it is a privilege
[1:37:24] for us to stand up here before you
[1:37:27] because I feel like every time we stand
[1:37:29] up and preach, it's a privilege because
[1:37:31] I am standing to the positionally placed
[1:37:33] elected bride of Jesus Christ. And when
[1:37:37] you realize who you are, and when you
[1:37:40] realize what you were called to do, and
[1:37:42] you realize that you wasn't born without
[1:37:44] a purpose, but that God has something
[1:37:46] for you,
[1:37:51] you're more than a conqueror.
[1:37:55] Your life is victorious.
[1:37:59] Musicians, won't you come up this
[1:38:00] morning or this evening?
[1:38:04] Joshua positionally
[1:38:07] placed and elected of God.
[1:38:12] As I was with Moses,
[1:38:15] so will I be with you. And no man shall
[1:38:19] stand before you all the days of your
[1:38:21] life,
[1:38:23] neither be discouraged.
[1:38:25] Why? For the Lord thy God
[1:38:31] is with thee.
[1:38:34] It's not you. It's not me. It's him
[1:38:38] through me. It's him through you.
[1:38:41] There's our victory. And when the it
[1:38:43] seems like the devil's tried to cut off
[1:38:45] every avenue and he's cut off your legs,
[1:38:47] he's cut off your feet. He's cut off any
[1:38:49] way you have to get victory. Just keep
[1:38:50] walking. When it feels like life's so
[1:38:53] cold and you're so numb because you've
[1:38:55] been hanging on the side of that
[1:38:56] lifeboat for so long, just keep walking.
[1:39:03] Let's stand if we could.
[1:39:11] Let's just bow our heads if we could.
[1:39:16] Sister Becky, won't you play that song
[1:39:17] through it all? Had come to me a little
[1:39:20] bit ago.
[1:39:26] Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:39:27] Father,
[1:39:30] we come to you this afternoon, Lord, and
[1:39:32] with this little message. Trust it is a
[1:39:35] message of hope,
[1:39:37] a message of deliverance,
[1:39:40] message of overcoming. As we hear about
[1:39:42] Joshua, your servant, how he was born,
[1:39:46] but he was more than born just a man. He
[1:39:49] was born
[1:39:51] with a purpose. And Lord, as we look at
[1:39:53] our lives and we see what you're doing
[1:39:55] in our church and in our homes and our
[1:39:57] lives, we have to realize that we were
[1:39:59] born
[1:40:01] more than just to be a a vessel on this
[1:40:04] earth, but we were born with a purpose.
[1:40:07] We were born with something for you to
[1:40:09] do in our lives, Lord. and we raise our
[1:40:11] hands and we lift our our our hearts to
[1:40:13] you and and and and bow before you,
[1:40:15] Lord, and say, "Lord, whatever it is you
[1:40:18] would have me to be. Whatever it is you
[1:40:20] would have me to do, Lord, tell me.
[1:40:24] Use me.
[1:40:28] Where you want me to go, I'll go. What
[1:40:29] you want me to say, I'll say. What you
[1:40:31] want me to sing, I'll sing.
[1:40:33] If you want me to preach, I'll preach.
[1:40:35] If you want me to to just be an
[1:40:37] encouragement, I'll be an encouragement.
[1:40:39] If you want me to clean the bathroom
[1:40:41] stalls, I'll clean the bathroom stalls.
[1:40:45] And Lord, what? No matter what I go
[1:40:47] through in life, no matter what 2026
[1:40:49] brings or whatever we went through in
[1:40:51] 2025,
[1:40:55] through it all, we find out that our
[1:40:57] trials make us strong.
[1:41:00] And Lord, through the trials, through
[1:41:02] the battles, every little victory we
[1:41:04] get, we'll give you praise. Every time
[1:41:07] that we that we overcome a little
[1:41:09] challenge, we'll give you praise. Any
[1:41:12] obstacle is placed before us, we'll ask
[1:41:13] you how to get around it, Lord,
[1:41:17] because we're dependent upon you, Lord.
[1:41:21] We love you, Lord. We thank you, Lord.
[1:41:24] We give [music] you honor, praise, and
[1:41:25] glory, Lord.
[1:41:28] Thank you, Lord.
[1:41:32] Oh,
[1:41:34] through it all. [singing]
[1:41:39] Through it all,
[1:41:43] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:41:48] I've learned to trust in
[1:41:51] [music and singing] God.
[1:41:54] Through it all. [music]
[1:41:58] Through it all,
[1:42:01] [singing]
[1:42:02] I've learned to depend [music]
[1:42:06] upon his word. Let's sing it once again.
[1:42:09] Through it all. Oh, through [singing] it
[1:42:13] all.
[1:42:17] [music] Through it all,
[1:42:21] I've learned to trust in [music] Jesus.
[1:42:26] I've learned to trust in God.
[1:42:32] Through [singing] it all, [music]
[1:42:36] through it all,
[1:42:40] I've learned [music]
[1:42:42] to depend upon his word. Well, I thank
[1:42:47] God for the mountains.
[1:42:50] Well, I thank God [music and singing]
[1:42:52] for the mountains.
[1:42:55] And I thank him for the valleys.
[1:42:58] [singing]
[1:42:59] And I thank him for [music] the storms
[1:43:03] he's brought me through.
[1:43:08] For if I'd never had a problem,
[1:43:13] I wouldn't [singing and music] know that
[1:43:15] God could solve them. I'd never know
[1:43:18] [music]
[1:43:20] what faith in God [singing] could do
[1:43:23] through it all. Now let's say to him, oh
[1:43:27] through it [singing] all. [music]
[1:43:31] Oh, through it all,
[1:43:36] I've [music and singing] learned to
[1:43:37] trust in Jesus. Oh, I've learned to
[1:43:42] trust in [music and singing] God.
[1:43:45] Through it all,
[1:43:50] through it all,
[1:43:54] I've learned to depend [singing] upon
[1:43:59] his [music] word.
[1:44:02] Through
[1:44:04] it all, [singing and music]
[1:44:08] through it all,
[1:44:12] I've learned to trust in [music] Jesus.
[1:44:17] I've learned to trust in [singing] God.
[1:44:22] Through it all,
[1:44:26] through it all, [music]
[1:44:31] I've learned to depend
[1:44:34] [music and singing] upon his word.
[1:44:37] Aren't you thankful you can depend on
[1:44:39] that word? We're just going to keep
[1:44:41] walking. We're just going to keep
[1:44:43] believing. No matter what happens, no
[1:44:45] matter what we got to go through, it's
[1:44:48] in him. It's in his word. Let's sing
[1:44:50] [music] that song. Let's change the
[1:44:51] pace. Walking up the King's Highway.
[1:44:55] It's a highway
[1:44:58] to [singing and music] heaven.
[1:45:02] None can walk up there.
[1:45:06] Oh, but the [singing] pure and heart.
