TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] morning brothers and sisters if we'll just stand this morning maybe brother John Wade w put us in prayer this morning you every expect can be smiss for Sunday school if you'll go in the Psalms with me to Psalm 62 Psalm 62 truly my soul waiteth upon God from him my salvation how long will ye imagine Mischief against a man you shall shall you be and as a to in fence my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him in God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my Refuge is in God okay I think we're at are we at nine okay surely men of low degree are vanity and Men of high degree are a lie to be laid in the balance they are all together line to theity God hath spoken once twice have I heard this that power belongeth unto God also unto thee O Lord belongeth Mercy for thou renous to every man according to his works for the Brian God bless you may be seated sorry about that Lord bless you all he is a I'm not trying to be a comedian here but I guess as I read that Psalm it it's got the positive and it's got the negative and I was just thinking I guess David had fake news in his day and in his day too but if you would turn to me that's what I was thinking because the opposite is people that deliberately tell you a lie knowing telling you a lie as it's the truth knowing what they're doing trying to deceive people about what really has happened and and that's a horrible thing but if you would turn with me to um math I mean Mark the 9th chapter I was reading this morning in Kings Second Kings also between uh Hezekiah and Manasses and I was just thinking it kind of kind of like where we're at today when we think of our own how you have a high and then you have lows then you have a high and then you have a low you know we went from one president another president but I just look at the scriptures and I look at the message of the and and I know no matter how you might feel things might get better they're not going to get better so it makes us realize not that as Americans we as Patriots we don't want our country to be we all want our country to be successful but we know that it's coming to an end here sooner or real soon and not to be deceived by the world out there as you see time going on it should make us want to get closer to Christ not be further away and I was also you know Manasses was a evil King and I and and when you think as a king I where I'm going here he literally defiled the temple of God that's one he set the clock in order for the for Judah to be taken away in captivity where you went from Hezekiah to Manasses to Manasses son who was assassinated to a good King but when Manasses come into rain that's when God set his clock and that's when the Babylonians and and Isaiah told Hezekiah because he showed all this stuff to the Babylonians God told he told Hezekiah that that Kingdom would come and take Judah into captivity but when Manasses did the things he did he set that clock he said it in order that the children of Israel would be taken into captivity no matter what they did they were going into captivity and it's no different for us this morning the message of hour has come you have the word of God for the hour that we live in this morning and the clock is set and the only thing that's going to help you as a is to realize that there's only one way you're getting out of here in a Rapture that's the only way you're getting out of here and anything else really doesn't matter you know we all want to be successful in our lives but the only thing that matters I know I say this a lot I can't say enough the only thing that matters is is it real to you is the presence of Jesus have you sold out everything for the master this morning that's the only thing that counts this morning any is just father the only thing that really a Believer this morning is to be totally committed to Jesus Christ this morning and all the Loose Ends that might you know like I mean there's numerous examples I can all the loose ends you just need to let him go the only thing that matters is Jesus Christ this morning and I was reading in um Mark 9 there was some other things I was going to say about manassis reain but it it goes on in our very n you know they were offering children at sacrifice but they do that all across our country's hospitals are are taking gal off of boys and girls and 100 years ago if a if a a wife and a mother had gone to a doctor and said I want you to cut the genitals off my son or my daughter what do you think think they would have done to that wife or to that father they would have put him in an insane asylum 100 years ago so it just let you know that the world is crazy and the only sane people are Christians this morning and I um I'll start about the uh 38th verse here this morning of the ninth chapter of Mark and he's talking about he takes a child I'll start if I read too much you'll have to forgive me but also I I hadn't even got started but what I'm trying to say that's the age that we live in people desire peace they desire safety they desire security and what are you will for it is what I would ask you what are you willing to sell to have peace and security this morning are you willing to sell your values are you willing to sell your relationship with Jesus Christ this morning to have some peace in the world that we live you're not you're going to cast it all aside you just want what God has for you this morning and do you we're all going to have decision one day what are we willing to where are we going to walk and how are we going to do are we going to sell out in our lives just a little piece or we just going to hold true to the Cross this morning and uh I'll start about the about the 35th verse here about the 30 but they held their Peace by the way they had disputed themselves who should be the greatest that's the world every everyone wants to be better than someone else and he goes on and he sat down and called the TW and said onto them if any man desired to be the all servant of all the servant leadership that's what Christian leadership is and he took a child and set him in the midst of them and when he had taken him in his arms he said unto them whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoever receiveth me receiveth not me but but he excuse me but him that sent me and that's the promise still this morning here John answered him saying we saw one casting out devils in thy name and not us and we forbade him because he followed not us and he goes Jesus goes on to say here Jesus said forbid him not there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil to me so you know you never really want to stop people from being good people good things he go for he that is not against us is is on our part whatso shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because belong to Christ verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward doesn't the most important thing no matter what you're doing good things that's great but like I just said in the beginning your heart's got to be right and you've got to be serving to the Lord to make it matter and it goes on whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it's better for him that Millstone be hanged about his neck and he into the sea and if they hand If thy hand defend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life M than having two hands and go into h into the fire that never shall be quenched where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched um there's a lot of churches out there if you read these scriptures there'd be people that walk out and If thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee halt in life than having two feet be cast into hell into fire that never shall be quenched where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out I that's when I think read this scripture I really think we this day age that we live in because you all have tablets you all have smartphones you all have all kinds of it out there and this is where this scripture really comes into this age you got to be careful what your eyes see if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee to enter in the kingdom of God with one eye and then having two eyes that be cast into Hellfire and where the worm dieth not but the fire is not quenched for everyone shall and I was just thinking of this this morning the 49th verse to the 50th verse for everyone shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt and Jesus goes on to say here salt is good but if the salt have lost its saltiness whereof will you season it have salt in yourselves and have peace one at another and you really need to have God salt in your hearts and lives and I'll just finish with this this morning it's a really I don't want to drop this mic I got notes everywhere but when I think of the where we at this morning I can only speak for myself where my heart is at this morning but I was reading this devotional from this uh uh every morning and uh brother brother brandom I I'll just read what he has and I was just thinking we really need to be dead to the things of this world that doesn't mean you can't enjoy your life you know you don't want to be like like the monks of a thousand years ago doesn't mean you can't enjoy a life but you need really to be dead to the things of this world and alive in the things of Christ and I'll just read this this morning and sit down and this comes out of uh first Peter the 2 chapter the nth verse I'm sure you all know this but you are our a chosen generation you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you show forth Praises unto whom him who ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light and this is what brother brandham had to say about this and U people come in and say them people are crazy well that's what they would say about you too sure they they they are the wisdom of God is foolish to man and the wisdom of man is foolish to God they're contrary one to another and that really true today and he goes but a real Spirit fill Church full of the power of God setting together in Heavenly places offering spiritual sacrifices Praises of God Holy Spirit moving among them Discerning sin and that's really important be able discern the truth from evil evil from good good from Evil discern the sin falling out the things among them that are wrong straighten out making it flat and level you know that's the most important thing about a Christian Life a steady level straight life that's what God wants to see because why always in the presence of God is that Bloody sacrifice you aren't saved by the blood but you're kept by the blood but you are saved by grace through faith believing it and anyone that tells you there isn't salvation in the message has it what brother brandom had to say God knocked at your heart because he predestinated you he he you looked up and believed it and accepted it now the blood makes an atonement for your sins and I'm sure we're all there this morning God does not condemn sinner for sinning and that's true he's a sinner to begin with he can he condemns a Christian for sinning and because he has condemned him Christ took our condemnation so there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and that's what I was saying earlier you got to push away all those things don't matter and just walk in the spirit this morning if anything wrong it isn't willful you just don't sin willfully a man that sins willfully goes out and willfully sin has never come into the body yet and I'm sure that none of us are there this morning but he goes on to say but a man that once is in there he's dead and his life life is hid in God through Christ SE by the Holy Ghost and the devil can't even find him is that where we are at this morning can the devil find you are you really dead am I really dead this morning so Esau back in there we would have to come out before the devil and never get in you're dead so what he's what he's saying here is your life is so dead to the things of this world that God the devil doesn't even see you this morning he doesn't know where you're at you're so hidden by the blood of Jesus Christ and so sold out to the things of God you're you just almost invisible he goes on to you have come to before and then I lost my place I don't want to reread it tell a Dead Man He's a hypocrite see what happens that and it's really true this morning this is where they really know if you're Christian or not when they start saying evil about you start kicking on you that's when they find out what you really are but then he goes on to say tell a Dead Man He's a hypocrite see what happens kick him on the side and say you old hypocrite you he'll not say a word and that's right he'll just lay there a man that's dead in Christ you can call him a hypocrite you can call him anything you want to he'll never rise up about it if anything he'll slip off somewhere and pray for you that's right I hope that's the way I'll act and but the some but oh some of them very much alive that's what I think about we're supposed to be to bury dead people them that are dead in Christ we bury them in the water sometimes we bury too many people that are alive and that's what's wrong with the world that you have to have that real experience when you go in in the water when you come back up you're not that same person anymore too much malice and strife there's too much in the church but we can't separate that and that's really important you can't make people live life but God has to separate you God has to show them the way what God does he knows his people he knows his he knows every voice he knows his children he knows who he's going to call out he knows who he's going to he's predestinated he he knows who he's given those things to what he's making himself through God puts confidence in his children on what to do knowing that they will do it exactly I would hope this morning that God would have confidence in me and in us as a church this morning that he could give us more I mean there's many blessings out there A lot of times people don't receive it because they're too afraid to reach out for those blessings this morning but I pray that God will touch each of your hearts that you that God will be in this assembly there's many needs this morning we all have heard the needs menant the only we all just have to reach out in faith as brothers and sisters to just reach out to God this morning to receive what he would have for us in this service today David love the Lord this morning amen God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning man and see all the smiling faces this morning and it's good to be here this morning and going to uh got an announcement this morning and I'll just take care of that because I'm very bad to forget so we won't get into that this morning and uh but there will be no service Wednesday night due to the Thanksgiving holidays coming up we always take that time off and spend with our families and things and we just appreciate all the Lord's done for us how many he's thankful this morning for what God's done for you this morning and I just think my and I told someone the other day I said you know I said I what I do for living I said every time I I buy an junk car I said I always try to remember to say Thank you Lord Lord for once again providing for me and I said you know he just kind of looked at me funny and I said you know I never want to get where I'm not thankful for as many blessings and you know without him blessing me you know he wants the Bible says if you don't work you don't and I tell people I said you know and you can tell by me that's why I have to work a lot because I like to eat a lot but I said I'm thankful for God's blessings this morning but you know that's that's a wonderful thing but the thing I'm greatest for this thankful for this morning is the what he put inside of my heart the desire to serve him this morning brother Carson did you have that song My Hope Is in the Lord

Wright with us next weekend amen both service Ohio so we're looking forward to Amen to that amen everybody amen if I don't see you before Thanksgiving a Happy Thanksgiving everybody amen may you enjoy your families amen and Thanksgiving amen amen and so we know that it goes all the way back to our forefathers I guess when they come over here and if I remember right they had a hard time that right and so amen they got all the goods and different things that they had I guess they had to go shoot a turkey because we keep shooting turkeys and eat turkeys for thankgiving anyway so they uh managed to survive it was a hard time for them a that right but amen so we have a uh Thanksgiving I'm thinking but Abraham said original holiday American holiday ain't that right amen well how many knows that uh amen a Believer has also we have we have a a Thanksgiving day amen it's every day amen we give thanks to the Lord in all things give thanks amen praise the Lord Lord amen and even I believe one place it talks about amen that he is worthy of thanks how many believes that God is worthy of thanks we thank one another sometimes but we don't thank him like we should amen abam talked about he says you went to somebody's house I guess and they didn't pray over their food and so forth and he reminded of him amen of a pig being on the apple tree and eating apples just eating apples never looking up and being thankful for where it came from that right so we are thankful for to God Amen because he is worthy of thanks and praise honor and glory and that's what we've been talking about our Series has been for the last little while amen we're talking about the attributes of God we know that God dwelt alone at one time and he didn't want to be alone ain't that right and he had attributes amen it's what he was amen and it's for that that we praise Him amen and everything that there is everything that there is is he is worthy of of Praise amen so we want to look at that again this morning with a little a little while and I thought my if I just take all of these I think there's about seven or eight of them seven different things that the Bible talks giving him honor and glory and and thanks and wisdom and strength and power and all those things you know and I thought I've got about 20 messages here so I thought well I'm going to tease them I'm going to tell them we're going to have two weeks straight services I was teasing but anyway I saidise maybe someday we will say hey let's just have a week at least you know let's have church every night maybe amen we'll just follow the leading of the spirit on it amen but amen so amen it's always good to get together amen and open the word of God Amen so if you will let's just bow our before we open the Bible we'll approach the author father once again Lord Jesus to be thankful to be in your house Lord Jesus and thankful to feel much better this morning Lord and Lord all the different ones father that seem to be feeling better we're thankful for that Lord Jesus and father for this cough and different things that Lord you've taken away from me Lord and delivered my wife lord of the terrible cough also we thank you Father for it and we just thank you all of your goodness to us Lord Jesus we just can't thank you enough and appreciate you enough father for who you are what you mean to us Lord but we want to try to express it this morning with the help of with your help Lord Jesus talking about how great is our God Amen you like the songs and sing with me how great is our God Amen and so we just want to brag on you today Father we know we can't brag on you enough Lord we that you'll bless the meditation of our heart now lead me and guide me father and help me to surrender you my that you might use me just Lord to speak father as you would want me to speak in Jesus name amen and also help the ears of the hearer to hear the way they should hear amen amen turn your Bibles and we will just amen it we'll just start somewhere how's that sound amen we'll pick one of these scriptures and because amen there's so many different things that we want to try to cover here this morning but basically the main thing that we want to talk about is the power of God Amen is that all right amen I called it uh I don't know if he's got it up there but uh think the power and strength of almighty God God's power and his his strength Revelations we'll go to Revelations I guess amen Revelations 5 actually let's go to Revelations 4 and you all forgive me but um we're going to read some of the scriptures we read before is that okay amen CU you know it reminded me of brother bham how that one woman wrote him a letter and said you know are you ever going to get job off the as sheep you know he said he was about one place he said six months but he's another place he said six weeks so he was on it for a long time amen and he says well you know as long as the Lord leads us to going that way we will you know and when he's done with it we'll we'll be done then he also talks about a preacher evangelist that went in a certain city amen he kept preaching on repentance for about five nights straight and the deacons come up and said man haven't you got something else to preach on besides repentance he says well let everybody repent and then we'll preach on else amen my my so we just want to follow the leading of the spirit is that all right Revelations 4 and verse 7 and the first Beast was like unto a lion and the second beast like unto a calf and the third Beast like the face of a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about them and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day nor night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was which is which is to come Le give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne I like that don't you glory honor and thanks thank you Lord amen the sit on Throne who liveth forever and ever and the four and 20 Elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that liveth forever and forever and cast their crowns Before the Throne and I don't know just how that'll be but from what I understand Paul said that God has given him a crown of life amen so if you're actually living if you're actually given a literal crown or I don't know but they did take their crowns and they threw it at his feet and said Thou Art Worthy because without you we wouldn't have these amen how many know without Christ you would never have eternal life you wouldn't have the life that you have now you wouldn't be happy like you are now you wouldn't be having peace like you have now you wouldn't speak like speakable and full of Glory like you have now so what is it he is

voice no loud voice wory is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing amen how many believes he's worthy of these things he's worthy to be praised to be magnified amen I thought about that word magnification magnified blow it up is that right when you have a magnifying glove makes it big he's worthy of magnification that's right when we tell stories of David is't that right we magnify the Lord why we might be talking about the David David he's slinging slinging sling and sling you know and he he was good at it he was a good

Revelations 19 Revelations 19 verse 11 y'all are turned into it so we'll take our time and let you find it once the leaves start rustling we'll read would that be all right verse 11 chapter 19 of Revelation says and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness does he judge and make war stop now for a minute how many knows what the what the revelations 19th Chapter is Revelations 19th Chapter according to the prophet of God is when God comes back with his bride a't that right a man one time you know when brother Bram told the story of when he went beyond the curtain of time he had his horse to come and nicker on him and so forth right ain't that right Fritz I believe his dog was there you know and his horse came up there nickered on him and so forth and he and a Critic said you know brother brandom your story was all good until you talked about a horse being in heaven and I think Brandon wrote him back and you know he says you know uh he says well I appreciate your criticism brother but you know I read over in Revelations whenever he comes back from Glory is't that right he's oh my when he comes back from Glory he comes on the White Horse and all the hosts of Heaven come with him on white horses the Bible says so you better get used to horses amen and that something out that we have something in our mind sometimes and it has to be the way it we think or it ain't right amen live a few years as I have and you find out that there's room to grow amen room for more understanding in our hearts and lives don't be so judgmental so critical amen all right judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns amen many crown it reminded me of uh uh uh maybe uh people in the Olympics where they get might get four or five goals maybe it's a 50 meter sprint maybe it's a marathon maybe it's 100 meter sprint amen it has all these Golds and they're just winning them how many know that's our Lord wins them all he's the champion of them all he has many crowns not just one but he's a champion of many areas amen I love to talk about those areas and what he really is amen praise the Lord many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God Heaven and Earth will pass away but his word will never pass away it'll never change it'll never lose its power amen how many glad for the and he was all right now notice and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine Len clean and white now do you reckon when we get over there to get robes white robes we're going to have white garments and we're going to be pure and white amen but over here you're all dirty and smutty I don't think so amen Bible talks about that she made herself clean amen amen she made herself ready amen and I believe we're getting ready now we're getting in those white gar now and that white garment is not your own righteousness but it's his righteousness amen how many has not your own right well I hope somebody hears this people that have their own righteousness all right always trying to condemn everybody else oh they ain't this and they ain't that means you're a dirty smudy person yourself cuz if you you'd realize that if the grace of God you'd be 32 and they need Grace not condemnation you're just trying to lift yourself up and make yourself feel a little better all right that was free no extra Char that many crowns now notice now notice and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword and with it that he should Smite the Nations and that he should rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth The Wine Press of the fierceness and Wrath of almighty God my don't want to be in the tribulation period there would you no huh talk about cruel wrath and he ha on his vesture and on his thigh a name written and I want it to read all the down to here to get you to get this he says a name written King of Kings he's the Lord Lord of lords I mean know over in England there's a king amen there's many lords or I guess they used to have Lord this one and Lord that one but how many knows that he is the Lord of all Lords he is the king of all Kings he is above all he's the Jesus greatest highest I will come today I am resolved no longer to linger Charmed by the world's Delights amen Jes the highest Jesus is the greatest he's the king of all Kings he's Lord of all Lords he's God of all gods amen how many beli that he's the god of gods amen for great is the Lord 1 chronicles 16 ver verse 24 is declare his glory among the Heathen his Marvel Works amongst the Nations for great is the Lord and greatly to be praised he also is to fear to be feared Above All Gods Not only feared but how many beli he is to be honored Above All Gods I say it this way above it and then he says in the next verse all your gods are they can't speak they can't do nothing nothing I'm The Only God that there really is every other God's a false god amen they can't help you anything you put before God and amen eventually all can help you but God is the only living God he can help you amen he's a I'm I'm just glad to have a living God God praise be to God Amen God is good amen uh it's letting loose it's a little bit in there yet but it's letting loose I thank the Lord for it amen that God is healing me all right so now I wanted to look at something with the help of the Lord because we find that whether it's Paul or or whoever it is you know they always begin to speak about God when they begin to preach the gospel and so forth amen and they begin to get their eyes focused on the god creation amen so because he is the truly the god of creation isn't he over in Colossians I think we'll start because there's several different scriptures but I want to go Colossians I believe it is yep Colossians Colossians Colossians says it this way chapter 1 verse 13 who ha delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the inv visible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that right that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible amen whether there be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers how many believe that he is above every principality above every Power that is out there God is above it all all things were created by Him and for him over Revelation it says he made them all for his pleasure and for thy pleasure they are and were created amen he is before all things and by all things and by him all things consist well I'd like to use the word exist amen let's take a look this morning we're going to take a look you could very well want to look at the power of God right we want to look at look at look take a look at him amen when I thought about taking a look at him I remember what brother brandham said about the eagle story and as the eagle steareth her nest y'all remember that story and Eagles have come up to a certain age and they'll get feathers on them and everything and they're almost fly is that right and he says that great Mama there and and get in front of them sit on they'll be in the Clift of the rock Ain that right they'll be up there all safe and all they've been all tucked in and all comfy and cozy but there she comes and there she comes and just sits right there right in front of them and begin to wave them with a't that right amen and tell them I love look this is this is your mama look how great your mama is how she can fly and that's what we do amen let me tell you something we aren't talking about no literal ego we're talking about this Bible here CU brother Bram said his right those wings are the Old Testament they're the New Testament the god of the Old Testament is the god of the New Testament how many believes that amen look and how powerful God is get your confidence in God Paul said that come to you amen with enticing words of man's Wisdom but I come to you in the power and the demonstration of the spirit that your faith would not rest in enticing words of men but that it would rest in the power of God how many de Moos this morning that's what we rest in that's what we rejoice in that's what we live in is the power of almighty God woo Glory how many glad his power is not external his power is not internal it is in the combustion chamber of our heart that's where it is amen praise be to God Amen praise the Lord oh I like that don't you amen whether they be thrown Powers they were all things created for him and by him and we look at oh my that's why I love to hear the stories why because what does where does your power come from where your faith amen where does faith come from hearing the word of God that's why it never gets old whether it's through the prophet of God or whether it was through David or whether it was through Samson or whether no matter what it was amen we look at those things and it inspired us to know that that God never has died the god that brother bam served he didn't die in 1965 with brother B that God is still present this morning he is still here that same Holy Ghost is still here I'm here to tell you we'll be a dead church if that Holy Ghost ever leaves but he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen he's empowering you and I amen he's bringing power to our hearts and to our souls amen church God hates a powerless church God don't want icicles hanging off the chandeliers huh everybody's so cold stiff somebody screaming at church and and shivers up your spine folks if somebody don't do a little Shout a little scream I'm going to tell you right now I get concerned why because God is great and he's greatly to be [Applause] praised go out there to a car race Amen in your car amen it's about that far ahead and me it goes across the finish line and you know you w you're like yeah yeah yeah yeah but you come to the house of God and say well boy I heard that before you sorry excuse you make God sick at his stomach we ain't going to have a little corner over for the cold and the stiff no then be there amen I'll tell you what if you're stiff and cold on God God's going to heat you up one of these days that's right he's going to get hot for you you're going to get hot sooner or later so you might as well get hot for God now and avoid the hot later no praise be to God hallelujah that's right never thought of it that way before that's about the truth though W be on C cold for God a mean God's got a fire ready for cuz he said I would you would be cold or hot either be cold or hot but don't be lukewarm amen at least the sinner in Dum Fox folks know where they're going that's right praise be to God all right so we look a that an awesome brother Brandon when he preached on look he says you know it's quite something he said I think he used a piano or a piano he says now look I said look at this and everybody's Focus would go on that and all of a sudden you're thinking piano keys chords music is that right but said God said in the Bible look unto me look unto me all ye ends of the Earth and be saved how many glad that you ain't got to do a thing you ain't got to work it up you ain't got to die at Calvary you ain't got to pay for your sin he already did it he already did it amen and all you got to do is lift up your head and look all the world has to know is lift up your head and look look look what he done for you on Calvary amen strangest things that God does sometimes God does the strangest things he says the strangest things he's got beasts with seven eyes and seven heads huh is't that right he uh when the children of Israel were murmuring and complaining in oh boy I'm going to say it again because I believe it was a deep revelation God gave me of complaining and murmuring people discontent God really really don't like that because you know where it originated from the devil wasn't happy in heaven he begin to murmur you know he gets too much Glory I'd like some of this glory and he complained and he murmured and he got twoth thirds of the Angels or a third of the angels to complain with him said you bunch of complainers and whiners get out of here he threw them out of heaven cuz they were not happy Israel was every time God would deliver him out of Egypt W praise the Lord amen then he let him get hungry oh my right back to doubt they went bring us out here to let us die of hunger oh and he rained down qu he rained down Birds he gave them all they can eat amen and while they were still using the tooth thick thicking out the teeth you know there ain't no water around here you came out here to make it through oh boy no wonder God said just step aside Moses just step aside I'll take the whole bunch out that's what he said isn't that right that's exactly right what that's exactly what God Said Moses step aside I'll eliminate every last one of them complainers and their murmurers you get somebody in church that's no matter what that just still not happy about it demonic [Music] forces you see why said with a little bit of vinance cuz I never really recognized what it was at the time but I know what it is people ain't happy with nothing they ain't happy with themselves need the baptism of the Holy Ghost need to get saved I don't care if you're sitting under a tree or if we got to go meet somewhere out here in the bush you'll still be happy well praise the Lord we'll come together and have us little church service but thanks be to God you can sit in a nice PE nice warm Church a place where the Holy Ghost meets you aren't you glad that the Holy Ghost comes and meets with us Amen in our services through our preachers amen I'm so glad for that I'm glad for that more than anything else I can think of you take this whole world Just Give Me Jesus take this whole world Just Give Me Jesus take the wealth of the world just give me Jesus that's all we want than Lord amen praise be to God take a look I like to take a good look don't you look at what he done look at who he is look at his great power my Amen in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth W what's that so excited about can you imagine how big that was that was big that was Major that's right but we how many know the biggest problem about our churches nowadays are you listening I speak by the Holy Spirit the biggest problem in our churches today is that we we have lost the reality of this it has become common too common to us I want Genesis 1:1 to do something for me I want Genesis one and two to do something Genesis 1 and I don't care from the very beginning to very end even the cover it's a holy bible I believe it from K to K and I believe the cover woo how many believes it that's right oh I'm so thankful for it I need a new body and I need more folks right brother Glenn amen it's Patty Glenn Glenn's not here brother Sean Patty my brain is a little bit Wheezy but that'll be all right and amen Sherry we were praying for him amen I hope he gets over that quick amen but was become common folks how many would and be real honest that you've let it become too common to you anybody anybody it needs to be more it needs to mean more in our hearts like brother Brian says man that's what's most important how real is it to you how real is it to you well this morning it's real to me amen even more real than ever amen how long you how long you been a Christian 40 I don't know 40 some odd years how is it now compared to then brother Bor what's oh it's sweeter than it ever has been it's better than it ever has been that's my testimony is that yours it's gets sweeter as it a going go by it gets more real as the days go by amen it oh my don't get me started amen how many knows whenever whenever uh that that just showbread amen and that they had in the holies of holies is right they had some of that Mana that fell on the ground and they put that Mana in that holies of holies amen do you think two three days later it got worms in it no the Bible says it stayed as fresh amen it's the day it was put in there amen and is the way that this word is amen when it's in the kind of Glory it stays as fresh amen As It Ever Was it never gets old it never gets [Applause] still no never get stale like your loaf of bread it's in fridge and many times I've opened it up and or out there get a and it's got mold on it what do you do with moldy bread you don't even give it to the dogs do you no you put it in the garbage amen well what did Brother lamb say if your Rel religion doesn't have any enthusiasm about it you might as well bury it it's dead you might want to go ahead and bury it get rid of it if you ain't got no enthusiasm about it amen Lord help us amen all right praise the Lord so where were we right let's go to another one so we see here in Colossians 1:16 amen that he created everything going never made it there all right thank you Jesus foring me of that amen you know I've learned in my life now so many times for reminding me of stuff I'd have totally forgot if he wouldn't have reminded I I rely on God to remind me of things don't you amen I I count him as my guide he's my guide is that right and so sometimes I forget stuff and don't remember and I says Lord you must purpose or the reason for me forgetting that I don't know but you know amen but my scripture Psalms 121 yall remember you don't have to go to it I'll read it right quick I will lift mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help heyen you know and if you just took that scripture it would look like you're looking to them Hills is that right now how many know ain't no can of bucket or or faith in a in a a bucket or you got to have your faith in the right thing brother Ram says not some post or some tree or some Hill huh but remember the one man brother B talked about how that he was an atheist all his life went out on a vacation I'm not sure if he was sick or not and dying or what but he went he went and and he was walking along these rocks and he be to look at these rocks and the man got saved looking at rocks if I understand brother Brandon right ain't that right because he says you had to come from somewhere man there has to be a creator that made you and when you begin to believe there is a you're on the road see the next verse says amen and my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth how many believe that's where our help that's where our strength come from and that made everything that's where your strength come that's where the come from it's the one that made it all he amen all right let me just go amen the one that coulds the moon the sun look look at what he done now I begin to think about how much power the kind of power that it would take to create create something like that we know that man has gotten famous for the things that they create things they build even the pyramids brother bam said that they don't know how they did it they don't have that kind of power to do it nowadays they had a power that we didn't know about to build those pyramids how great those pyramids I guess are be nice to see them sometime perhaps just to be in awe ain't that right of the pyramids and so forth that heat they made but then you think about you think about each star that's out there each Galaxy that's out there Amen brother Glenn and sister Sherry what was your David David your nephew yeah Reeves he has the what do you call that yeah but anyway they they look at the galaxies and study and stars and everything like that and and and there was a certain area not so long ago told me about that there was all these godet they thought they had it all figured out but they look between these little Glo of stars a little bit in between and they really focused out on that and they look way out through there and they found more galaxies between the stars and they say that there's more stars than there is sand upon the Earth is that right more stars out there God spun them out there spun them out there spun them out out there hung the moon hung the stars now let me stop there and think about you business people you business people that run your business and how busy it gets right this worker that worker there's someone here he has a flat tire this one here you got to keep it all working Marth and N know they run a big business get up at 3:00 I understand a lot of times in the morning to try to make all of this run right hopefully all the workers working this add the other the labor that it is the strain and the things that'll go into it ain't that right it takes a lot there you go amen that's right it takes a lot to do all of that can you imagine God hanging all of those out there isin that right Heaven the Sun the moon the star the Earth all of those things and then he has to keep them running perfectly all of them has to stay in their places the Earth the Sun the moon everything has to rotate perfectly imagine the power that it takes for that all to happen I can say without a doubt that it's beyond our comprehension it's beyond our comprehension and then to think amen that each individual that he sits at the right hand of God Amen today making intercessions for every saint all over the world not only that but answering their prayers that takes a lot of power it takes a lot of power our God is an awesome God He rigns from heaven above with wisdom power and love our God is an awesome [Applause] God power amen amen my wife don't mind but she said you know why can't I be like that woman that brother Brandon Met there at that little 10- cent store she was 60 years old I guess looked about 30 that right and she he said you know what is the secret do you not having be old wrinkled and all this other stuff she says brother brand I'll tell you what when I was younger I got saved I got saved and any time that I have a problem I just hand it to God if it's too big for him I sure don't need to try to deal with him amen so she learned to lean on God let God fight your battles give your case to the Lord Jesus Christ he's an awesome attorney he'll fight for you just give it to him learn to surrender to him he'll take care of your [Applause] problem amen he's a big God he's not too big for him how many believes he's a specialist our God is a specialist amen I love that amen I meant to bring it I don't guess I did so I'll just say it it's kind of like this preacher was down in Florida and his GMC vehicle broke down he was in the shop the mechanic was in there just trying to figure out what in the world wrong with this couldn't figure out what and there was a well-dressed man come over there amen and he says here let me take a look at that and he looked at it a little bit here and he moved this one this wire this whatever he moved it around a little bit and he say now try it then went in the guy went in there and cranked it up and then after a bit they come over and he says say just tell me who are you anyway he says chief engineer of of of and I oh my think about it he was the chief engineer he knew how to do it and brother bam says we've got a chief engineer he's well dressed in the righteousness of almighty God he knows how to take care of things he neared it he knows how to fix your problem I me know we got an engineer that knows how to fix Let Jesus fix it let God fix it amen when you scratching your head quit scratching your head get the chief engineer he'll take care of it amen how many we've got a great physician when the Physicians can't do anymore there is a higher physician he is our great physician what do they call that now when there's a chief doctor in the United States right F foozy or something like that was a couple years ago he didn't do so good did huh but they have a chief doctor of the United States but I want you to understand that there's a higher doctor amen than the chief doctor of the United States his name is Jesus Christ he is our great physician I'm so glad of it amen praise God so I lift my eyes unto the hills look at the Creator Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus isn't that right look at him I never stop never finish my story amen with Israel there they were in and they were complaining I was talking about how that God has weird symbols sometimes strange things does things in symbolic forms and he'll use lions and many heads and whatever it takes to why because how many knows it's never stupid may seem weird to us but it's not it's perfect I mean know God don't have no dumb thought God don't have no weird thought might be to us but no it's perfect when he says it I don't care if it's a woman with seven heads I don't care what it is why because we know it's a type and he types it and so forth but anyway so back to the story there they are Israel complaining and all of a sudden fiery serpents amen they begin get to bite them ain't that right snakes bit him a type of sin I think he said when they complaining is the type that a person by sin amen they bat him and bat him and people dying by thousands 10,000 D he said take one of these serpents and put it up on a pole a that right take a serpent take a snake and put it on the pole and anybody that looks up at it boy folks had to be real ignorant not to go ahead and run or get there as quick as you can and look Ain that right just look maybe some of them were crawling up but they just about dead and man maybe snakes hanging on their they were just getting around the corner do they could they looked all of a sudden they got full of life shook the snakes off because look let me tell you something that's the way it is with Christ when you look at Calvary when you look at Jesus on the cross am me sin's got to go death's got to go sickness got to go weary got to go and mean life you spring forth you begin to jump up and down say hallelujah it does something for you when you look at him take a look it's got power power power power to change your life amen that's right and the de symbl from what I understand Brother Brad right that's on ambulance is Right which goes all the way back there but wouldn't it be something if that was still in effect here comes the ambulance just look at the symbol get up and go you ain't got to get in the ambulance look at the symbol look at the symbol and get up say I'm Healed you know that's something funny but that's just a new thought I don't know if anybody has ever done that I don't know if it's ever happened but heard that it's possible how many believes it's possible that when you get hurt the ambulance shows up and you say I remember what brother Bible said look at that cross believe and be healed it'd be miraculous I'd love to hear a story like that that I believed it with all my heart and I got well my my legs straightened up whatever it might be it's all things possible to them that believe amen the power of God we live in an age folks how many knows we live in the age when church folks are hey highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truth Breakers and so forth having a form of godliness going to church but deny deny that Jesus still heals deny that there's still the baptism of the Holy Ghost deny there's still sanctification of the heart deny that there's still the powers of God in the church deny people and Hollow deny people to worship God the way that they should they would put people out if they worship like you and I did if I screamed like this in an Hest church I can see a bunch of amag men grabbing my arms toting this guy out he is way too excited he is way too fanatical amen I'm here to tell you the Bible says when we get over there that big crowd it sounds like thunder sounds like thunder woo I'm still wondering what it would like sound like if we all screamed and hollered all at one time sometime up in here maybe it'll happen some of these times amen woo glory amen I'm I'm I'm not practicing I'm doing it for real I'm praising God on this side I'm giving him glory and honor in this side so that when I get over there I won't be out of place I won't have to worry about somebody looking over on be funny W that's right I'm going to scream

words no letters you put together awesome great in inite whatever just not great enough Amen to put it together to express how wonderful God is and what his presence is like amen praise the Lord I don't know but yall remember seeing a picture of our hery leer I guess I don't know if it's Hercules or Hercules or whatever but a strong man holding the world up y'all remember that that gym maybe a lot of times they'll have it at a gym the man holding the whole world up muscles bulging is that right brother Braham says man you have these bodybuilders you have these movie stars you have all this fine stuff and in a few years they will the way they shrivel and they die that's all vanity amen that's right you might have the Hercules the strongest man in the world holding the world up but I want you you to understand amen you might think of Arnold Schwarzenegger is that right a great big man we know his name because of how great he was in strength and muscles is't that right we know Mike Tyson for his iron mic for his I guess his uppercut right hand or something like it's either his right hand or left I don't know but it was one of them that was deadly dangers is't that right amen remember Mike Tyson we name remember Muhammad Ali remember all these great names amen but you know the Bible says that his name is above every name it's above every name amen and I'll tell you who's the true Hercules I'll tell you who's the Str strong man when Christ was going up the calvary amen bearing the cross he was holding the weight of the world on his shoulders but he made it all the way a't that right and he went and conquered death hell and the grave he has the mighty conqueror he's the champion of the world he is the champion he has the crown for being the strongest man ever that's right strongest man ever was Jesus he truly had the waited the world on his shoulders did it he carried it all of our sins all of the whole world's sins failure and sin of every person that ever committed a sin that cross would have been good for Cain his sins it would have been good if Cain would have accepted all those who the benefit of it until he paid the price is't that right but when they accept that the sacrificial lamb or the uh the sacrificial lamb substitute substitutional lamb down through the dark dark ages Old Testament they accepted that that was May meaning they were believing that the lamb was going to come and God held them there until the real lamb came when it came amen it says that that place opened up and they went to Paradise is that right they come up and they got the benefits of it Cain could have but he didn't accept it di Jesus died for the sins of the whole world from the beginning to the end if they would just accept it amen praise the Lord he was the true one that is his name is above every name that is named see which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and at his own right hand in Heavenly places far above I like that far above all principalities and power and isn't that weird not weird but isn't that something how he talks about above power above might above Dominion above every name that is a named not only in this

there was no one could do it no angel no sarim no Archangel no Sheran nothing could do it so God himself came down in the form of man and bridged away and made way so that we come across that bridge amen he went all the way to death hell conquered it all and made us it's a way back for you and I that were Sinners without the Holy Spirit having to go to work empty come home empty defeated it
