[29:05] i had no one knew just what to
[29:11] [Music]
[29:24] don't never
[29:27] leave me
[29:35] [Music]
[29:55] how many is happy
[29:57] amen god bless you may be seated for
[29:59] just a little bit if you lie
[30:00] i'm gonna
[30:02] take just a moment and uh
[30:05] i'm gonna go
[30:06] sing if it's all right
[30:08] and
[30:09] have maybe a song for the lord and then
[30:12] get right into the preaching of the word
[30:13] of the lord i just want to say what a
[30:15] privilege it is to
[30:17] be here with you again always count the
[30:19] supreme
[30:21] elkton
[30:22] and uh
[30:23] we uh
[30:24] just know that the coming of the lord is
[30:27] drawing nigh
[30:29] and we're getting a little bit closer a
[30:30] little bit closer as the days go on and
[30:33] god knowing that we would be in a
[30:35] position as the elect of god that we
[30:37] would need not only the strength of a
[30:39] message like we've got today
[30:42] but the outpouring of the holy ghost
[30:44] that we've received as god's people
[30:47] and uh
[30:49] yes sir all right
[30:52] hold that thought for just a moment
[30:54] technical difference
[30:57] i thought i had it on
[30:58] no
[30:59] yes no
[31:01] now you can hear it all right praise the
[31:03] lord
[31:04] i'm a doctor y'all i know how to turn a
[31:06] microphone on you know
[31:07] [Laughter]
[31:09] anyways god knowing we would need the
[31:11] strength of not only a great message to
[31:13] get us through this time
[31:15] but the lord knew what kind of
[31:17] outpouring of the holy ghost we would
[31:18] need in this last day
[31:20] that's why brother bremen taught us that
[31:22] it's not the
[31:23] what we would say it's not the chemistry
[31:26] of the blood of jesus christ for us
[31:28] today that washes of our sin
[31:30] 2000 years ago but it is the literal
[31:33] life of jesus christ
[31:36] you think about that you think yourself
[31:38] what does that mean exactly well it's
[31:39] very simple what it really means is it
[31:40] means that
[31:42] nothing that we believe is an unknown
[31:45] whatever we need to get ourselves ready
[31:47] for the rapture has been laid right out
[31:49] there before us we're not waiting on
[31:51] anything folks people got this idea in
[31:53] their mind that some great big thing is
[31:55] going to happen this way or that way
[31:56] what they're talking about when they
[31:58] think of revival and great revelations
[32:01] and those type of things what they're
[32:03] thinking
[32:04] about tribulation people
[32:07] because the great next revival that's
[32:09] going to take place publicly will be
[32:11] with moses and elijah and that'll go
[32:13] straight to the 144 000 and israel will
[32:15] receive those two prophets and honey
[32:17] she's going to have a revival like
[32:19] you've never seen before imagine 144 000
[32:22] i'm get the holy ghost at one time oh
[32:24] god just let me look over the banister
[32:26] and just watch that thing happen you
[32:28] talk about church
[32:29] and uh when they find out where they are
[32:32] they ain't gonna sit around like much as
[32:33] messes people do you know kind of
[32:35] looking around the corners of the
[32:36] building they're gonna be thrilled
[32:37] they're gonna be excited and they're
[32:39] gonna be drunk on the holy ghost even a
[32:41] little bit it wouldn't hurt any of us to
[32:43] get there tonight don't you think so
[32:45] amen i i i love worship and i love
[32:48] worshiping the lord and remember all of
[32:51] these things are
[32:53] the children's
[32:54] bread you believe that
[32:56] hallelujah and i'll say this last thing
[32:59] just as uh just passing a comment you
[33:01] know i i think one reason folks do sit
[33:03] around and look at the corners of the
[33:04] building they've just really lost their
[33:06] excitement you know for the things of
[33:08] god brother brahm talked about it
[33:10] becoming common to us
[33:12] and i i pray all the time you know being
[33:15] a preacher and i'm on the road you know
[33:16] sometimes
[33:18] 60 000 miles a year 52 weekends a year i
[33:20] mean i've wore out four or five cars in
[33:22] the last 20 years traveling you know and
[33:25] and uh
[33:26] you know it's um
[33:28] uh a lot of times the same remarks same
[33:30] sermon same bible same jesus same
[33:32] message and all of that and to be
[33:35] he's
[33:36] get common after a while repeating the
[33:38] kind of phrases telling 100 people
[33:40] they're going to get the holy ghost and
[33:41] then telling 100 churches on top of that
[33:42] to get the holy ghost and after a while
[33:44] those phrases just become almost
[33:46] repetitious but i pray all the time but
[33:48] the day that my key that my heart i say
[33:50] god just let it continue to be fresh
[33:52] don't i don't want it to just start
[33:54] running into that thing where it just
[33:55] becomes words to us just keep it fresh
[33:58] in my heart that's what i really love
[34:00] and i i love it when the lord does it
[34:02] that way and i believe he does it that
[34:04] way because once it's
[34:06] something you're passionate about so
[34:08] you've got to be passionate about
[34:13] i said the violent
[34:15] he said we'll take uh the kingdom of god
[34:18] i'll just put it the king james way he
[34:19] said the kingdom of god suffereth
[34:21] violence and the violent passionate
[34:24] take it by force
[34:26] those people around this truth i'm
[34:28] afraid that are just casually a part of
[34:30] it they just casually go to church i'm
[34:33] afraid they're going to find themselves
[34:34] in a very rough place one of these days
[34:37] and you think the economy is bad wait
[34:39] until that hour arrives
[34:41] amen and then
[34:43] the destructions and the things on top
[34:45] of that
[34:46] we don't want to wind up the tribulation
[34:48] period because we're just casual
[34:50] christians
[34:51] i want to be so aggressive that when i
[34:54] start to wake up in the morning the
[34:55] devil down in hell says everybody get
[34:57] ready here he comes again
[34:59] hallelujah don't you feel that way
[35:01] yeah i do too you know i saw something
[35:03] the other day i i thought was
[35:05] interesting the prophet of god talked
[35:07] about how california is going to go down
[35:08] right
[35:09] did you know and i didn't realize this
[35:11] too that i never thought of this the
[35:12] other day did you know that if
[35:14] california or los angeles specifically
[35:16] sinks into the ocean do you realize how
[35:19] much of the world's economy is tied
[35:22] to just that one thing right there alone
[35:25] if california goes off breaks off into
[35:27] the ocean if los angeles is what brother
[35:29] bram said repent los angeles not
[35:31] california but los angeles if los
[35:33] angeles has sunk
[35:35] all of the major businesses and
[35:37] international trades of the world on
[35:38] that coast out there it will literally
[35:41] send the world into an absolute complete
[35:44] economic failure altogether just that
[35:46] one action of los angeles going in
[35:50] now folks you
[35:51] people that say brother branham didn't
[35:53] know what he was talking about well he
[35:54] may not know he was talking about but he
[35:56] was a vessel to let god use him to tell
[36:00] us what the truth of it was and you
[36:02] imagine what kind of impact corona had
[36:04] upon the world economy just think when
[36:06] all of their big banks and businesses
[36:08] and their men and all them are sitting
[36:09] about 60 000 leagues under that
[36:12] it'll put him in bad shape
[36:14] oh god let my heart be ready for the
[36:17] hour of the coming of the lord amen well
[36:20] anyways just nice to talk to i love you
[36:22] so much and uh thank you for coming to
[36:24] church tonight you probably had a
[36:25] feeling it might be me and you showed up
[36:27] anyways appreciate that
[36:29] amen but uh uh we we we certainly love
[36:33] the lord and uh we'll sing a little bit

[46:47] amen
[46:49] and amen
[46:50] and amen let's turn in our bibles if you
[46:53] would like to go to the old testament
[46:56] tonight i'd like to invite you to the
[46:57] book of psalms
[47:00] and we're going to look just a little
[47:03] bit more on a subject that i i preached
[47:06] to you some time ago on divine healing
[47:09] and just feeling led to the lord just to
[47:11] dig back into that tonight
[47:13] and uh you may not remember when i
[47:15] preached it or what i said i promise i
[47:17] won't leave you leave you behind but i
[47:19] just felt led to kindly revisit some
[47:21] things that i didn't get to
[47:23] some time ago
[47:25] psalm 103 and then i want to look at one
[47:27] two and three verses one two and three
[47:31] psalm 103
[47:33] one a psalm of david
[47:37] bless the lord
[47:38] o my soul
[47:40] and all that is within me blesses holy
[47:42] name
[47:43] bless the lord
[47:45] o my soul and forget not all his
[47:49] benefits
[47:51] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[47:53] who healeth
[47:55] all thy diseases now i want you to
[47:57] notice how that iniquity and jesus is
[47:59] directly connected together
[48:00] so when you look at someone saying well
[48:03] sickness yes sickness is
[48:05] there it's present it happens but
[48:08] sickness doesn't just occur because it's
[48:10] sickness alone
[48:11] sickness is the result of sin
[48:14] maybe not your sin
[48:15] but maybe someone sins back
[48:19] in the generations before you maybe the
[48:21] reason why that certain things are with
[48:24] you today
[48:25] is not really something you're conscious
[48:27] of it's something that happened because
[48:29] of sin somewhere in your family line
[48:32] listen to this i want to uh
[48:34] bring you out of the he cares that you
[48:36] care message now brother said we believe
[48:38] that doctors
[48:40] help people
[48:41] what's a dangerous quote to read in the
[48:43] time of this vaccination debate ain't it
[48:47] thankfully i'm brave enough to read
[48:48] brother branham i think he knew more
[48:50] than i did anyway
[48:51] i believe that god heals my medicine
[48:54] god heals by surgery
[48:57] god heals
[48:59] by understanding
[49:01] god heals by love to show a little love
[49:05] goes a long way
[49:06] that someone be upset and just show them
[49:08] you care for them see god heals by love
[49:11] god heals by prayer god heals by
[49:14] miracles god heals by his word god heals
[49:17] whatever the source is god heals by it
[49:20] it's god that heals for he said i am the
[49:23] lord that healeth all thy diseases let's
[49:25] pray for the word
[49:27] father we thank you this evening
[49:29] lord for the privilege of being able to
[49:31] open up the bible and to be able to
[49:32] speak the word and the
[49:34] dictates of our heart
[49:36] lord we are so grateful that as we are
[49:39] assembled together in this place not
[49:41] only did you promise to be here where
[49:43] two and three are gathered but lord
[49:46] jesus you by your grace and mercy are
[49:49] going to take thy word tonight and speak
[49:51] to each one of us we are thankful
[49:54] tonight lord we open our hearts and turn
[49:56] our cup up waiting upon your reigns to
[49:59] come into our lives may you speak to us
[50:02] now and edify us by the preaching of the
[50:04] word anoint me lord jesus that i might
[50:06] be able to get out of the way that you
[50:07] can use me and anoint their hearts that
[50:09] they might be able to receive take all
[50:11] the business of the day away from us
[50:13] lord and strengthen our bodies and our
[50:14] minds and our spirits that we might
[50:16] receive from your table tonight as we
[50:19] committed to you in the name of the lord
[50:21] jesus christ and all the saints said
[50:24] amen you may be seated mate god bless
[50:26] you so very good now
[50:29] i don't want to just uh i don't want to
[50:31] waste any time on some of these subjects
[50:33] i want to jump right quickly as i can
[50:36] into the subject that i was hoping to
[50:39] bring some time ago and y'all are such
[50:42] good pullers that you know i don't even
[50:44] have to read these notes sometimes but
[50:46] sometimes when things are left laying
[50:48] there i say well
[50:49] i really wish i could have got into that
[50:51] you know as a preacher sometimes you
[50:52] just wait on the lord wait on the lord
[50:54] wait on the lord and then sometimes he
[50:55] gives you a green light to revisit a
[50:57] couple things and i thought tonight i
[50:59] just felt like i saw the light changed
[51:01] green and and i want to start from where
[51:04] we read now and i want to jump into the
[51:06] new testament and have you got your book
[51:08] there first john chapter 3 and i want to
[51:10] look at verse 10. and then
[51:13] i want to read three verses inclusive 10
[51:15] 11 and 12 by god's grace
[51:18] to to lay a little bit of some of these
[51:20] thoughts i want to preach on uh into you
[51:23] tonight now while you're turning there i
[51:25] want you to listen to this statement
[51:26] brother brahman says uh christ couldn't
[51:29] help being what he was he was a son of
[51:31] god and he said see what i mean now he
[51:34] said if you were intended you see the
[51:37] word of god if you were intended you see
[51:40] the word of god you believe it because
[51:42] why he said have you ever heard of a
[51:44] strain in a family a son will kind of
[51:46] impersonate his father or the mother
[51:48] grandmother grandfather that strain in
[51:51] the family you said you've heard of it
[51:53] he said it's the same thing from
[51:55] predestination you're supposed to be
[51:58] here in the right way at the beginning
[52:01] but being that you come the way you did
[52:03] you're subject to the fall but being
[52:06] that you're predestinated you hear the
[52:08] word of god and it brings you right back
[52:11] where you were predestinated amen never
[52:14] saw that before he said if you hear
[52:15] brother ben i'm on that tape he goes
[52:18] never saw that before
[52:19] fresh right out of the platform right on
[52:21] him now i i also want to read now
[52:25] this and john to kind of uh
[52:27] dovetail all this together notice he
[52:30] said in this the children of god are
[52:32] manifest and the children of the devil
[52:36] whosoever doeth not righteousness is not
[52:38] of god neither he that loveth not his
[52:41] brother for this is the message you know
[52:43] i i we hear that term thrown around
[52:46] thrown around thrown around thrown
[52:47] around message message message message
[52:50] i'm not making fun this is what brother
[52:51] branham called his message he said i
[52:53] have a message in the last day but when
[52:56] people use that term the message i wish
[52:58] they'd put this in with their
[53:00] terminology he said this is the message
[53:03] that you've heard from the beginning
[53:04] that we should love one another and all
[53:07] you christian people out there said amen
[53:10] right not as cain
[53:11] who was of that wicked one and slew his
[53:15] brother wherefore slew he him because
[53:18] his own works were evil and his brothers
[53:22] righteous now
[53:24] i want to stop for a moment and and just
[53:26] hold your place there in john we're
[53:27] going to revisit it in just a second and
[53:29] i want to talk to you just a minute
[53:30] about where my mind is at on this
[53:32] subject okay first of all when we talk
[53:35] about sickness when we talk about what
[53:37] sickness is
[53:38] we know that sickness
[53:41] in jefferson summarize at all what it
[53:43] really is
[53:44] sickness is an invader of the body it is
[53:47] an invader of someone's cells an invader
[53:50] is someone's
[53:51] perhaps your bloodstream uh whatever
[53:53] part of your body that that germ gets
[53:56] into it's an invader that goes into your
[53:59] body illegally and it gets in there
[54:01] contrary to the nature of the human
[54:04] system and the natural process of your
[54:07] system and it invades with the purpose
[54:10] and the intent of destroying now we know
[54:13] what the bible tells us in the book of
[54:15] james when he tells us to humble ourself
[54:18] before the mighty hand of god that he
[54:19] might exalt you or peter set apart me
[54:22] but he goes on to say after we are
[54:25] humbled before the lord he said remember
[54:27] your adversary the devil goes around
[54:30] walking like a roaring lion seeking whom
[54:32] he may devour see satan from the very
[54:36] beginning has been from his change from
[54:38] being lucifer the great angel down to
[54:42] satan or this demon this head demon of
[54:44] all of these groupings of angels that
[54:47] fell and became demons lucifer's whole
[54:50] purpose in becoming what he became was
[54:53] to become god to be worshiped and to do
[54:56] all those things that he spoke about in
[54:57] the book of isaiah but also don't forget
[55:00] in order for him to be worshipped and to
[55:02] be like the most high he was going to
[55:04] have to invade another spot in the
[55:07] kingdoms of heaven he said i will go to
[55:09] the north and amen he said i will become
[55:12] like god set up my kingdom and so forth
[55:14] like that and i i was laughing i told
[55:17] somebody other day they said uh you know
[55:19] how in the world do you know that god's
[55:21] a southerner i said because the devil
[55:22] wanted the north evidently god must have
[55:24] been in the south amen you can think on
[55:26] that and say amen a little bit later now
[55:28] when we look at the way that satan
[55:30] organized his affairs and when he put it
[55:32] all together and he placed that in there
[55:35] remember that the devil was not trying
[55:38] to take uh creative power because he had
[55:41] none and start a brand new kingdom a
[55:43] brand new work apart from god but his
[55:46] whole purpose was to invade amen god's
[55:50] creation and god's kingdom and god's way
[55:53] of doing things and to invade that and
[55:56] corrupt it and pollute it same thing
[55:58] exactly takes place and every time you
[56:00] see a church split or you see marriages
[56:03] split or home split somewhere there has
[56:06] been an invader that got into the
[56:08] sanctity and the synchrony of that home
[56:10] and split them apart just absolutely
[56:12] drove a wedge and next thing you know
[56:14] husband and wife are fussing and
[56:16] fighting there's no agreement
[56:17] you don't love me anymore i don't love
[56:19] you anymore all this kind of stuff
[56:20] church is the same people the same with
[56:22] friends on and on why because satan who
[56:25] is an invader decided to make himself a
[56:29] wedge in between amen the angels of the
[56:32] lord and almighty god in the beginning
[56:34] he preached to those angels a beautiful
[56:37] kingdom gospel the prophet said and as a
[56:40] result of preaching that message he was
[56:42] able to draw a thousands of these angels
[56:45] away from the presence of the lord and
[56:47] they become demons as we know them today
[56:50] then what did satan do as the prophet
[56:52] told us sin did not start on the earth
[56:54] but sin started in heaven he'd after he
[56:57] invades heaven and separates and
[56:59] conquers in heaven then he goes right to
[57:01] the earth and there's nowhere for him to
[57:04] go nowhere for him to work in until he
[57:07] was able to invade the serpent and as
[57:10] the serpent stood there created an image
[57:13] of a man he was close enough to look
[57:15] like a man had the same type of blood
[57:17] that a man would have same type of cells
[57:19] and chromosomes and genetic structure
[57:21] and all of that and then standing there
[57:23] having a place for a soul but had no
[57:26] soul the devil somehow was able to
[57:29] figure out i can invade that body now we
[57:31] don't know exactly how he got there
[57:33] there's many silent things in the
[57:34] scripture that don't tell us the
[57:36] whereabouts and the timelines and how
[57:38] that happened but all we know is that
[57:41] when satan invaded the serpent moses by
[57:44] vision went all the way back and christ
[57:47] pinpointed him right to the moment that
[57:50] satan began to invade the entire human
[57:53] race now let's be honest about it he
[57:55] could have gotten the serpent time and
[57:57] time again could have used the serpent
[57:59] maybe made test runs so to speak of how
[58:01] he could influence that beast but yet at
[58:04] the same time none of that had any
[58:06] significance at all until eve stopped to
[58:09] listen to him one day when the devil
[58:12] invaded that serpent's mouth and he said
[58:15] yea hath god said we may eat of the
[58:17] fruit of the trees of the garden but the
[58:19] fruit that's in the midst don't touch it
[58:21] or eat it unless you die and then now
[58:23] satan is going to not only invade the
[58:25] serpent but now he invades eve brother
[58:28] brennan tells us that he invaded her
[58:30] mind before he ever got to her body
[58:32] before he ever got to her spirit before
[58:35] her soul became polluted before the lord
[58:37] satan had already invaded the womb of
[58:40] her mind am i preaching that past you
[58:42] listen that slow which one amen now
[58:44] remember the holy spirit then is also an
[58:47] invader he wants to come into the human
[58:50] heart and he wants to invade our lives
[58:52] and he wants to separate us from the
[58:55] wages of sin and from the behaviors of
[58:57] sin and from the things that amen would
[59:00] cause us to wind up in the regions of
[59:02] the lost the lord jesus not only invaded
[59:04] my heart but he invaded hell he invaded
[59:07] everything there is to invade that's why
[59:09] they hated him so bad when he showed up
[59:12] in human flesh he invaded all of their
[59:14] synagogues he invaded all of their
[59:16] doctrines he didn't leave them one bit
[59:18] of room to be able to set that and say
[59:20] well we have this jesus said do you all
[59:23] right and then he would lay the
[59:24] scripture on just bust the thing all to
[59:26] pieces
[59:27] the devil absolutely despises being
[59:30] upped in his own game but we love it
[59:32] thank god he does now i want you to
[59:35] think now about the things that we read
[59:37] remember he said the lord has benefits
[59:40] to divine healing to his mercy and so
[59:43] forth and he said but iniquity shall be
[59:46] forgiven at the same moment your body is
[59:49] healed now do you realize that even
[59:51] james said that if you'll call for the
[59:53] elders of the church he said the prayer
[59:55] of faith shall save the sick but listen
[59:58] and if there be any sins they shall be
[1:00:01] forgiven that's not the baptism of the
[1:00:03] holy ghost but that is the blood of
[1:00:05] jesus christ washing away past sin or
[1:00:08] past iniquity in a person's life
[1:00:10] whatever led them to the spot to where
[1:00:12] that they were able to take on this
[1:00:14] sickness being invaded by the sickness
[1:00:17] the holy ghost goes in there and just
[1:00:18] wipes that thing clean all the way back
[1:00:21] this is why jesus said now go and sin no
[1:00:24] more or a greater thing will come upon
[1:00:27] you later and friend it's always
[1:00:29] important to remember that if the lord
[1:00:31] does any kind of supernatural act in our
[1:00:33] life of any kind of any shape form or
[1:00:36] fashion we should purpose in our heart
[1:00:38] from that moment on to dedicate every
[1:00:41] single day and minute thereafter to
[1:00:43] nothing but his service and to surrender
[1:00:45] ourselves completely to the lord jesus
[1:00:48] christ amen you believe that say amen
[1:00:51] now notice again that if he is the
[1:00:53] healer that also forgives the iniquity
[1:00:56] if iniquity and the sickness come
[1:00:58] together amen then iniquity must be a
[1:01:02] special key to understanding how
[1:01:05] sickness operates
[1:01:08] now what does iniquity do for you and i
[1:01:10] all right let's stop for a moment and
[1:01:11] let's think about what that means
[1:01:13] brother branham and the bible clearly
[1:01:15] make it just a plain picture for all of
[1:01:17] us that when someone has iniquity
[1:01:20] iniquity is when you know to do
[1:01:22] something but you fail to do it
[1:01:25] now brother if you're ignorant of it
[1:01:27] sister if you're ignorant of it that
[1:01:28] might be one thing
[1:01:29] but when someone knows what is right and
[1:01:32] what is wrong and they step over that to
[1:01:35] do their own thing them it becomes
[1:01:37] iniquity
[1:01:38] and remember it was not the sins of the
[1:01:41] amorites that god was waiting to fill
[1:01:43] the cup it was the iniquity of the
[1:01:46] amorites you see people get this in
[1:01:47] their mind that the lord is not just and
[1:01:49] that he doesn't overlook things and show
[1:01:51] leniency to people when they're ignorant
[1:01:53] he does i guarantee you that many of the
[1:01:56] people walk in the face of this earth
[1:01:58] that you and i would take a message book
[1:02:00] and throw at them from a distance and
[1:02:01] say you're going to hell don't you know
[1:02:03] how to do anything different that cigar
[1:02:05] and that dip and those clothes and that
[1:02:07] hair and on and on and on but rather god
[1:02:09] cannot hold them accountable for what
[1:02:11] they don't know he cannot judge that we
[1:02:14] would look at some guy walking around
[1:02:16] tattoos all over his body big gauges in
[1:02:18] his ear a man smoking on the end of a
[1:02:20] cigarette riding a motorcycle acting
[1:02:22] like a tough guy and we had cussing out
[1:02:24] of both sides of his mouth and we would
[1:02:26] look at that fella and we would say man
[1:02:28] those cigarettes gonna send you to hell
[1:02:30] man all of that is gonna send you to
[1:02:32] hell no it's not the thing that will
[1:02:34] send him to hell is the fact that once
[1:02:36] he realizes he is a sinner once he
[1:02:39] rejects the propitiation that can
[1:02:41] forgive him of his sins that is what
[1:02:44] sends him to hell cigarettes don't send
[1:02:47] you to hell whiskey and all that don't
[1:02:49] send you to hell but it is knowing that
[1:02:51] you need to be saved and rejecting that
[1:02:54] that's the thing that sends you to hell
[1:02:56] quicker than all the alcohol and the
[1:02:58] pubs and all of the honky tonks in the
[1:03:00] world there's not enough of that that
[1:03:02] can send a man to hell all of that is
[1:03:05] done because he knows he's a sinner and
[1:03:07] he refuses to get right
[1:03:10] remember folks when people commit
[1:03:11] adultery and they lie and they cheat and
[1:03:13] they steal them they do all kinds of
[1:03:14] manners of evil they're not doing them
[1:03:16] things because they're a christian
[1:03:19] that's just doing some bad things
[1:03:22] doing little you know little little
[1:03:23] badnesses
[1:03:25] they're doing them things because in
[1:03:26] their heart they're still a sinner
[1:03:29] you realize one reason that a lot of
[1:03:30] people operate the way they do in
[1:03:32] churches and act the way they do in
[1:03:33] churches they saved
[1:03:34] i'm not talking about holy ghost i'm not
[1:03:36] saved
[1:03:38] one of the first things that you should
[1:03:39] dedicate your heart to doing is just
[1:03:41] simply be saved
[1:03:42] go to the lord and say i'm a sinner i
[1:03:44] need salvation
[1:03:46] because i'll beg to tell you right now
[1:03:48] brother i'll argue any day of the week
[1:03:49] that many of our people will talk holy
[1:03:52] ghost holy ghost revelation revelation
[1:03:54] they've never been saved
[1:03:55] they said right on these pews like i did
[1:03:57] as a boy raised up hearing about the
[1:03:59] prophet raised up seeing the pillar of
[1:04:01] fire raised up seeing the church age
[1:04:03] pictures and all of the paraphernalia
[1:04:05] that goes with this message but nobody
[1:04:08] seems to care enough about our young
[1:04:10] people or individuals in the church for
[1:04:12] that matter to say hey have you ever
[1:04:14] been saved have you ever recognized
[1:04:16] sitting here in the house of god that
[1:04:18] you are a sinner and you have a savior
[1:04:21] if you want him and his name is jesus
[1:04:23] christ
[1:04:24] if we could ever come to that spot and
[1:04:26] get started on the right foundation
[1:04:28] we're on our road to true healing in our
[1:04:30] lives
[1:04:33] we have an expression an idiom so to
[1:04:35] speak that we use when we call it don't
[1:04:36] put the cart before the
[1:04:38] horse if we ever expect to have the
[1:04:41] quality of life that god wants us to
[1:04:43] have
[1:04:44] and that quality of life isn't this
[1:04:46] scientific version the psychological
[1:04:48] version where every day you live you're
[1:04:49] going to be smiling
[1:04:51] because i got news for you brother life
[1:04:53] has made up like that
[1:04:55] and some of our young boys and girls
[1:04:57] sitting here you're gonna get married
[1:04:58] one of these days god willing
[1:04:59] and
[1:05:01] don't let hollywood teach you that
[1:05:03] marriage is all about one ear to another
[1:05:04] it ain't
[1:05:06] there many times you feel like killing
[1:05:07] them
[1:05:09] it's okay to say man we're in the house
[1:05:11] of god don't lie don't lie
[1:05:13] there are many times you you my mom used
[1:05:15] to say about me it was a boy it's a wild
[1:05:17] when i was a little boy she said there's
[1:05:18] been many times i've contemplated murder
[1:05:21] for that child
[1:05:24] right marriage is made up of all kinds
[1:05:26] of strains and difficulties and
[1:05:28] pressures
[1:05:29] it's not an easy thing and many times
[1:05:31] we'll sit back and we might say to
[1:05:33] ourselves ah christianity ought to be a
[1:05:35] bowl of cherries ought to be happy
[1:05:38] it is all of that but it's a fight to
[1:05:40] get there you have to surrender you have
[1:05:42] to struggle you have to work to get to
[1:05:44] that spot
[1:05:47] and often it is created this image is
[1:05:50] created in our minds
[1:05:53] now once you start serving the lord
[1:05:55] all your problems go away
[1:05:58] well let's just be very plain very
[1:06:00] honest you're living in a world
[1:06:02] that is as anti-god and anti-christ as
[1:06:05] it could possibly get
[1:06:07] now sister i realize you want to look
[1:06:09] pretty i realize i'm not bashing our
[1:06:10] sisters to that when i say this i
[1:06:12] realize you want to do little things
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:15] makes you look pretty and all that you
[1:06:17] should look pretty if our boys get that
[1:06:18] spirit on my mom be sure to lay my hands
[1:06:20] on them suddenly
[1:06:24] it's all right if you want to wear a
[1:06:25] pretty dress or curl your hair or if you
[1:06:27] want to uh you know i mean people almost
[1:06:30] pass out if they see a girl with a heel
[1:06:31] on them
[1:06:32] we've become so legalistic oh my god
[1:06:35] she's got heels
[1:06:37] yeah on the bottom of her feet too
[1:06:41] and they act like oh they can't do this
[1:06:43] and that listen but you take our sisters
[1:06:46] with one little necklace around their
[1:06:48] neck or one little ring on their finger
[1:06:50] compel compare them women to the modern
[1:06:53] day woman walking the street today you
[1:06:55] got day and night just as clean as it
[1:06:56] can be
[1:06:58] the fact of the matter is when people
[1:07:00] are so legalistic about everything
[1:07:03] most of the time when you hear preachers
[1:07:05] carrying on like that about women he got
[1:07:06] a problem with them women he don't want
[1:07:07] to see him pretty
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:11] it's okay you don't have to say it man
[1:07:12] i'll say it for you amen
[1:07:15] right and he's scared to let people have
[1:07:17] liberty because he's got a problem
[1:07:19] himself
[1:07:20] right many of the preachers that are so
[1:07:21] legalistic they got that dominating
[1:07:23] thing on them that the people have to do
[1:07:25] it exactly like they say so are we
[1:07:27] trying to form the people in the image
[1:07:29] of the preacher then or in the image of
[1:07:31] jesus christ
[1:07:33] look at the questions they asked brother
[1:07:34] ram while we're here let's just stay on
[1:07:35] in a minute but is it okay for a woman
[1:07:37] to wear a necklace or a pen he said now
[1:07:39] sister i have no scripture on that so
[1:07:41] why is it everybody else does
[1:07:44] brother brown didn't have no bible but
[1:07:45] they do
[1:07:46] it's like return ministry in the tent
[1:07:48] vision he said i can't interpret it but
[1:07:50] we've got 4 4 800 people this message
[1:07:53] for the last 60 years that's had a
[1:07:54] better interpretation than the man who
[1:07:56] had the vision himself
[1:07:58] preached to me
[1:08:00] right
[1:08:01] the thing i'm trying to show you is that
[1:08:03] iniquity develops in the heart of the
[1:08:05] people whenever we begin to see the word
[1:08:08] of god not some man's idea
[1:08:12] a person is not sinning
[1:08:14] then my mom was telling about it the
[1:08:15] other night whenever she said we were an
[1:08:17] apostolic we were told you women you
[1:08:19] stay away from your husband don't you
[1:08:21] hold his hand don't you kiss him don't
[1:08:22] you be romantic with him in any way he's
[1:08:24] a sinner
[1:08:25] thank god brother come along and said
[1:08:27] don't you women do that you'll drive him
[1:08:29] from the presence of the lord
[1:08:32] and yet the attitude becomes what is
[1:08:34] iniquity iniquity is not the idea that
[1:08:37] you've got formed in your head about
[1:08:38] what spiritual looks like
[1:08:41] spiritual is not based on your idea
[1:08:45] well hallelujah
[1:08:48] i meant to get here by the way so i'm
[1:08:50] here now i'm taking a little bit of a
[1:08:53] road around to say a couple things but
[1:08:54] just bear with me a moment
[1:08:56] you know myself personally for years i
[1:08:58] wouldn't wear a beard i'm a preacher
[1:09:00] preachers don't wear beards
[1:09:02] until one day i got to looking in the
[1:09:03] mirror and i thought to myself
[1:09:05] why
[1:09:07] why do i care what people think about
[1:09:09] something silly like that
[1:09:10] where's the quote
[1:09:12] oh if jesus was here with a business
[1:09:14] suit on he'd have a three-piece business
[1:09:16] suit on and he'd be clean-shaven
[1:09:19] yeah i know that's what he said
[1:09:21] but many of you men unless you are
[1:09:23] willing to wear a three-piece suit every
[1:09:25] day of your life
[1:09:27] be quiet
[1:09:32] that's not iniquity
[1:09:34] ourselves oh it's iniquity glory to god
[1:09:37] as i've told you this when i was in a
[1:09:39] certain place in canada a fella said to
[1:09:41] this one sister because she had red on
[1:09:44] that sign of adultery and some of them
[1:09:46] people snuck around when they wasn't
[1:09:47] what he wasn't looking and they said
[1:09:49] brother ben is it is it really what do
[1:09:51] you think about that i said now listen
[1:09:53] this guy's my friend he's my brother and
[1:09:55] i'm not saying this to put him down but
[1:09:57] him and i've had these very
[1:09:58] conversations ourselves but i've told
[1:10:00] him just like this he needs to get his
[1:10:02] nose out of the scarlet letter and get
[1:10:04] it in the bible where it belongs
[1:10:09] there's nothing in this message that
[1:10:10] teaches such things like that you know a
[1:10:12] lot of that is men that's got problems
[1:10:14] you might as well preach to him it's
[1:10:16] coming anyways
[1:10:18] right they're trying to cover up their
[1:10:19] own sinful ways himself
[1:10:22] making our women look like a bunch of
[1:10:23] antiques
[1:10:25] uh-huh praise the lord the lady told my
[1:10:28] wife here not about seven years ago
[1:10:30] you are a married woman put your hair on
[1:10:33] top of your head i said i beg your
[1:10:34] pardon
[1:10:35] i'm her lord and i like it down
[1:10:41] and of course sister samantha being the
[1:10:42] good sport she is she went along with it
[1:10:44] until we got home and she said i'll do
[1:10:46] with my hair what i want i said not as
[1:10:48] long as i'm sucking wind sister
[1:10:51] you're mine and the bible said your body
[1:10:53] mine your eyes are mine and your hair is
[1:10:56] mine that's where you handle that one
[1:10:59] quote the word
[1:11:01] but the point being is all of these
[1:11:04] things that sum up what the church has
[1:11:06] called iniquity for years they're not a
[1:11:08] special bible for this stuff much less
[1:11:10] the message of the hour we realize that
[1:11:12] brother ram is preaching holiness to
[1:11:14] people he is basing it on a godly
[1:11:16] standard but people have taken that
[1:11:18] thing and run 47 ways to sunday instead
[1:11:21] of really preaching to people where
[1:11:24] iniquity genuinely lies
[1:11:26] i would rather take a person walk in
[1:11:28] this back door and sit down this pew and
[1:11:31] not know nothing about nothing but have
[1:11:33] a pure heart before god that they can be
[1:11:35] corrected and dealt with and worked on
[1:11:37] and the holy ghost can touch them and
[1:11:39] teach them something then some of these
[1:11:41] stubborn legalists around this message
[1:11:43] that think if you chew more than one
[1:11:45] pack of gum in a year's life that you
[1:11:47] somehow sin before the lord
[1:11:53] iniquity is not a man's idea iniquity is
[1:11:55] when now let's see close iniquity is
[1:11:57] when god god
[1:12:00] has revealed to you
[1:12:02] what is sin from his
[1:12:06] word if you're not careful you'll get
[1:12:09] caught up in a lot of people's opinions
[1:12:12] and opinions are like elbows everybody
[1:12:14] got one
[1:12:17] and what you can do with your little
[1:12:19] opinion
[1:12:20] you can take it and you can place it
[1:12:22] next to the next guy's opinion and then
[1:12:24] put that opinion next to the next one
[1:12:25] and take them pick them up gather them
[1:12:26] up in a bag and throw them in the trash
[1:12:28] can
[1:12:29] because they don't mean anything trying
[1:12:30] to get saved
[1:12:34] hey brother look if god wants to save
[1:12:36] you and fill you with the holy ghost
[1:12:37] sitting in that seat right there
[1:12:39] me dragging you to an altar to pray
[1:12:41] through isn't going to uh
[1:12:43] uh a bit of good if god wants to do it
[1:12:45] another way
[1:12:46] that's why we need to be sensitive to
[1:12:48] the holy spirit come on preach to me
[1:12:51] now operate by a program we're not
[1:12:53] denominational people that's the whole
[1:12:54] reason we follow this message is
[1:12:56] organizations of the devil
[1:13:03] notice
[1:13:05] y'all everybody okay
[1:13:07] anybody need to break to take a blood
[1:13:08] pressure pill or get some insulin or we
[1:13:10] good all right
[1:13:13] now i want you to think about how this
[1:13:15] bleeds into what john said
[1:13:17] john and i'm going to sum it up this way
[1:13:19] john is essentially saying
[1:13:21] that what manifests the child of the
[1:13:24] devil
[1:13:26] is his feeling and his attitude toward
[1:13:28] his brother
[1:13:30] if a man is filled with the love of god
[1:13:34] there's no way he can hate another saint
[1:13:37] now i'm just going to say saying
[1:13:39] specifically there's no way he can hate
[1:13:40] his brother
[1:13:42] no way
[1:13:44] that doesn't mean you won't get angry
[1:13:45] doesn't mean you won't get crossed won't
[1:13:47] feel anger you won't be upset maybe even
[1:13:49] a little bit a bit of bitterness or
[1:13:51] fight some kind of a hard feeling but
[1:13:53] there's no way that a man could absorb
[1:13:54] hate into his heart
[1:14:00] if i'm full of the love of god how can i
[1:14:02] hate you
[1:14:04] there's no way in the world
[1:14:06] so notice john is identifying
[1:14:10] that the sickness of the sinner
[1:14:14] is not necessarily the behavior
[1:14:16] but what is dwelling in them so if love
[1:14:19] is dwelling in men god is love and hate
[1:14:21] is dwelling in another then the devil is
[1:14:23] hate
[1:14:25] so the real issue of healing in our soul
[1:14:28] has more to do
[1:14:31] with what dwells here
[1:14:34] than what this does
[1:14:36] now some of y'all folks probably won't
[1:14:38] think brother ben preaches this way so
[1:14:40] often he probably don't believe in
[1:14:41] holiness i do
[1:14:43] but i also i'm not going to spend a lot
[1:14:44] of time beating people over the head and
[1:14:47] i mean if i stop and ask you how many
[1:14:49] years you've been in this message 30
[1:14:50] years 40 years 20 years 15 years
[1:14:53] some of you kids in here raised in this
[1:14:55] message you got seniority already you
[1:14:57] don't even know nothing married yet
[1:15:01] i mean why in the world do we have to
[1:15:03] spend all of our time trying to beat
[1:15:05] away you mean to tell me that girl she
[1:15:08] wore a ribbon in her hair
[1:15:11] what that sinner
[1:15:14] and half the church got hate in their
[1:15:16] heart
[1:15:17] bitter
[1:15:18] angry mean
[1:15:20] oh i hit a land mine good i like land
[1:15:24] mines
[1:15:24] like when my daddy blows them up
[1:15:28] the attitude of a child of god when it
[1:15:30] comes to iniquity is not about behavior
[1:15:33] on the outside
[1:15:37] folks
[1:15:38] this is the reason many of us look at
[1:15:40] our walk with god and we judge ourselves
[1:15:42] not to be a christian and not to be
[1:15:44] spiritual because we judge ourself by
[1:15:46] behaviors out here which is not what we
[1:15:50] really are at our core
[1:15:52] paul said it himself the things i want
[1:15:54] to do i don't the things i want that i
[1:15:56] don't want to do that's what i'm doing
[1:15:59] those are paul jumped back here and said
[1:16:00] i need to get the holy ghost i need an
[1:16:02] older call get your music loud and fast
[1:16:04] so i can get saved
[1:16:05] paul said i found the law when i'm
[1:16:07] trying to do good evil sitting right
[1:16:08] there
[1:16:10] preach to me
[1:16:13] the core of who we are if i am a child
[1:16:16] of god
[1:16:18] then my behavior will reflect what i am
[1:16:21] my neighbor
[1:16:24] and even if i do things that isn't as
[1:16:25] out of spiritual as highly godly if i've
[1:16:27] really got the holy ghost here
[1:16:29] he'll make this come in line eventually
[1:16:33] sure he will
[1:16:34] jesus said when he comes he reproved the
[1:16:36] world of witness that's what he did when
[1:16:37] he entered into this world
[1:16:39] he reproved it awakened wickedness
[1:16:42] we come from the type of churches when i
[1:16:43] was a kid that didn't teach too much
[1:16:45] holiness that way and so when i was a
[1:16:47] boy you know i run around shorts for a
[1:16:48] number of times
[1:16:50] i never will forget whenever i first
[1:16:51] received the holy ghost
[1:16:54] i stood up one day to put on my shorts
[1:16:56] go to school i was in high school when i
[1:16:58] got the holy ghost i was on my way with
[1:16:59] my shorts
[1:17:01] the whole day i felt like i had
[1:17:02] assaulted somebody or stole from them or
[1:17:05] done something
[1:17:07] oh they didn't teach you know their
[1:17:08] attitude back then ah let that boy wear
[1:17:11] them so i ain't no big deal but the holy
[1:17:13] ghost thought different about me
[1:17:15] now you do what you want but as a
[1:17:16] preacher the holy ghost told me not to
[1:17:18] do it
[1:17:19] and i wasn't permitted to do it
[1:17:21] therefore i had a nice little bonfire
[1:17:23] when my mother come in that evening
[1:17:27] why did i do that because i read it in a
[1:17:28] book no because the holy ghost led me
[1:17:30] don't do that
[1:17:33] when a person at their core is jesus
[1:17:36] jesus will lead him and guide them
[1:17:40] hallelujah
[1:17:42] into every spot of truth in every place
[1:17:44] this is why preachers are called of god
[1:17:47] to make sense of the word
[1:17:50] they're called of god to show the people
[1:17:51] what the truth is but they are not
[1:17:53] called of god to be your holy ghost and
[1:17:55] your discerner
[1:17:58] now listen folks i'm going to say
[1:17:59] something a little strong but don't let
[1:18:01] it check you
[1:18:02] a preacher has no business
[1:18:05] meddling in your affairs before the lord
[1:18:09] if you pray a certain way or you think a
[1:18:11] certain way or you do a certain way
[1:18:14] it's none of my business
[1:18:16] how you do what you do
[1:18:19] don't pass out now hang on breathe and
[1:18:22] through the nose out through the mouth
[1:18:25] not my
[1:18:26] job to educate you on how to live
[1:18:30] you want to learn that go to school
[1:18:31] somewhere find you a clinic talk to a
[1:18:33] doctor psychologist
[1:18:35] it's my job as a minister to show you
[1:18:38] how to yield yourself to the holy ghost
[1:18:40] who will show you how to do those things
[1:18:45] that's why some some sister may say you
[1:18:47] know i can't wear a necklace like that
[1:18:49] that thing gets a hold of me when it
[1:18:50] does next i want to have rings on every
[1:18:52] finger
[1:18:52] and dude it up and load it up fine
[1:18:55] the holy ghost leads you to do it that's
[1:18:56] fine but don't make that your plum line
[1:18:58] for everybody else
[1:19:01] unless it's just that right sin
[1:19:03] we know the commitment adulterer is
[1:19:05] wrong we know that you know those kind
[1:19:06] of
[1:19:07] things are wrong we know that being a
[1:19:09] thief is wrong
[1:19:10] you know and some people are bold enough
[1:19:12] for this message to say well i could
[1:19:13] steal and do this that the other doesn't
[1:19:15] bother me you know that may bother you
[1:19:16] but i do what i want to do
[1:19:19] we're talking about people that are
[1:19:20] making excuses
[1:19:23] because all along
[1:19:24] iniquity is hiding inside of their
[1:19:26] hearts
[1:19:29] a real child of god full of the holy
[1:19:30] ghost don't make an excuse for the wrong
[1:19:32] things
[1:19:34] nor do they make an excuse for the right
[1:19:36] ones
[1:19:38] they just simply yield and let the lord
[1:19:39] do the leading
[1:19:42] i can see why you wanted me here tonight
[1:19:46] praise the lord
[1:19:48] notice he said whosoever doeth not
[1:19:51] righteousness is not of god i see that
[1:19:55] a man's got to do righteous all right
[1:19:57] explain that to me tell me what it looks
[1:19:58] like
[1:20:00] now if i go home with you tonight i can
[1:20:01] pull the book on you before we get done
[1:20:03] with the cart right and you can pull it
[1:20:04] on me
[1:20:05] you'll see enough out of me and enough
[1:20:06] out of you to where both of us will be
[1:20:08] starting to pray for one another to get
[1:20:09] saved
[1:20:11] come on
[1:20:13] righteousness righteous behavior is not
[1:20:16] the everyday constant action and never
[1:20:20] making a mistake and never messing up
[1:20:22] and never getting discouraged that's why
[1:20:24] our people are running out of here in
[1:20:26] droves
[1:20:28] because nobody offers folks
[1:20:30] hope how am i supposed to preach people
[1:20:33] into a rapture
[1:20:35] and not give them the everyday peace of
[1:20:38] mind
[1:20:39] to know that
[1:20:41] they
[1:20:42] wake up and they're in a bad mood god
[1:20:44] ain't gonna throw them in hell for it
[1:20:48] hello
[1:20:50] how are we gonna get ready for the
[1:20:51] resurrection
[1:20:52] how are we gonna prepare our families
[1:20:54] and our churches to get ready for the
[1:20:56] coming of the lord when we put so much
[1:20:58] fear on people so they can't even pray
[1:21:00] without acting like a catholic almost
[1:21:02] like the rubbing beads and every word
[1:21:04] has to be perfect and they've got to say
[1:21:06] brother
[1:21:07] to be spiritual
[1:21:10] what is it it's iniquity in the hearts
[1:21:12] of people they know they need to get
[1:21:14] right and they're just not yielding
[1:21:16] themselves to the lord and because
[1:21:18] they're not
[1:21:20] like adam they've got to make their own
[1:21:22] religion to appease their conscience
[1:21:26] so therefore if a man isn't going to get
[1:21:27] right with god a woman ain't going to
[1:21:28] get right with god and they still want
[1:21:29] to be religious this is what you get
[1:21:32] this is the mess you get
[1:21:36] they'll be so religious they can't even
[1:21:38] buy a chocolate bar on sunday
[1:21:42] preach brother ben
[1:21:45] but they will sit in the house of god
[1:21:47] service after service night after night
[1:21:48] day after day listen all kinds of
[1:21:50] hundreds of preachers listen every
[1:21:52] sermon could be preached and still never
[1:21:54] yield their heart to become a safe
[1:21:56] born-again christian
[1:21:59] living so perfect and so clean that you
[1:22:01] couldn't put a finger on their life
[1:22:05] and yet iniquity is there they're still
[1:22:07] sick
[1:22:08] they're still a sinner and they're still
[1:22:10] eat
[1:22:13] with sin disease eat up with it
[1:22:20] well i've put you on some tough places
[1:22:22] before but tonight's a dandy
[1:22:24] still love me everybody with me still
[1:22:27] i see a lot of white teeth out there i'm
[1:22:28] doing all right so far just don't start
[1:22:30] gnashing on me with them teeth all right
[1:22:32] i got new boots on i don't want you
[1:22:34] messing my boots up
[1:22:36] praise the lord watch again now
[1:22:39] neither he that loveth his brother for
[1:22:41] this is the message
[1:22:43] not his cain who is of that wicked one
[1:22:45] now watch how john describes this he
[1:22:48] doesn't go into the works
[1:22:52] and then go into where he was up
[1:22:54] he goes into where he was of
[1:22:56] and then he connects that to his works
[1:23:00] why was cain's work evil
[1:23:03] because of who he was
[1:23:05] iniquity was in his heart
[1:23:08] oh glory
[1:23:10] but why was abel's righteous
[1:23:13] because faith was in his heart
[1:23:16] praise be to god
[1:23:19] how do i know that i'm going to turn out
[1:23:20] all right and not be cast off into the
[1:23:22] lake of fire because in my heart is the
[1:23:25] faith the revelation of the son of god a
[1:23:28] personal revelation in me that god loves
[1:23:30] me that god has died for me and raised
[1:23:33] for me and it's gonna take me out of
[1:23:35] this whole satan scene one of these days
[1:23:40] my confidence of how i behave doesn't
[1:23:43] lay in my ability to do it
[1:23:48] it lays in his ability to give me the
[1:23:50] feeling
[1:23:52] the faith
[1:23:53] the confidence praise god with the david
[1:23:55] to get all that in feeling inside
[1:23:58] to give us everything we have need of to
[1:24:00] want it
[1:24:02] because let's face facts if god didn't
[1:24:04] do that for you you wouldn't want it
[1:24:07] come on don't you look at me that way
[1:24:09] oh brother ben i've been in this message
[1:24:11] all my life yes but if you're not
[1:24:12] converted you're still a sinner and you
[1:24:14] still have not got faith in your heart i
[1:24:16] don't care how righteous you live on the
[1:24:18] outside it's got to be on the inside
[1:24:20] press into the works out later
[1:24:24] people do the
[1:24:26] works because they think the works is
[1:24:28] what pleases god they quoted
[1:24:32] abraham my works
[1:24:36] sure but james said this remember what
[1:24:37] he said
[1:24:39] you say you've got faith
[1:24:41] and you've got works he said i'll show
[1:24:43] you my faith
[1:24:45] by my works
[1:24:48] not apart from it
[1:24:50] but faith is what produces genuine works
[1:24:53] he uses abraham y'all
[1:24:56] to give us the example of that
[1:24:58] did you ever stop to think who he was
[1:25:00] talking about
[1:25:01] this the guy
[1:25:03] that not only fell on his face and
[1:25:04] laughed at god when god first told him
[1:25:06] he's gonna be a daddy
[1:25:08] but then he lies two different times
[1:25:10] before his body changed and after his
[1:25:12] body change lies
[1:25:14] hello
[1:25:15] takes his son all the way up to the
[1:25:17] mountain
[1:25:19] and when he finally gets his works in
[1:25:21] line
[1:25:24] isaac said father
[1:25:26] here's the wood
[1:25:28] here's all these other things but
[1:25:29] where's the sacrifice
[1:25:32] do you know that abraham was so
[1:25:34] determined to please god
[1:25:39] that the lord had to send an angel of
[1:25:41] god in an express manner
[1:25:45] urgently
[1:25:46] because when abraham drew back that
[1:25:48] knife to kill that boy abraham meant to
[1:25:50] follow through
[1:25:53] and remember the angel of the lord stays
[1:25:55] his hand
[1:25:56] he sends the message from god down to
[1:25:58] abraham says now i know you love me
[1:26:03] and that's a strange thing to say he who
[1:26:05] called the friend of god it took that to
[1:26:07] show god that he loved him
[1:26:09] it's not that the lord didn't know that
[1:26:11] he loved him but he was god was seeing
[1:26:12] out of abraham's life the thing of love
[1:26:15] and your
[1:26:17] heart is now producing it on the outside
[1:26:19] brother that don't come right away
[1:26:22] then things don't happen overnight
[1:26:24] you've got to fight labor and struggle
[1:26:26] and die daily to get to the spot to
[1:26:28] where you can really express those
[1:26:30] things in christ
[1:26:32] might i remind you that when galatians 5
[1:26:34] talks about the fruit of the spirit
[1:26:36] fruit in the tree don't show up on its
[1:26:37] first planet
[1:26:39] it shows up when it hits maturity and
[1:26:41] when it starts growing into a lively
[1:26:43] branch that's when fruit starts
[1:26:45] producing out of the life
[1:26:48] but my goodness how many people in this
[1:26:50] message want to put carp before horse
[1:26:54] you get saved today and in a month from
[1:26:56] now they expect you creating squirrels
[1:26:59] i'm just trying to figure out how to
[1:27:00] pray
[1:27:04] hello
[1:27:06] i've spent all these years just trying
[1:27:07] to learn how to live right
[1:27:10] and if
[1:27:11] anybody's still working on that
[1:27:13] [Applause]
[1:27:14] you're still fighting still struggling
[1:27:16] to keep your humanities checked
[1:27:18] sure
[1:27:20] but many times we hear these these
[1:27:22] inflated sermons from people in the
[1:27:24] message
[1:27:25] and listen these words how many times
[1:27:27] have you heard this the elect of god
[1:27:30] has nothing to do with the world
[1:27:33] the scary part about that is is
[1:27:36] this guy is going to be the one that
[1:27:38] defines to me what the world looks like
[1:27:42] even based on his ideas
[1:27:45] based on what he thinks
[1:27:48] so that way for some of you guys in here
[1:27:49] that like sports
[1:27:53] the second that you sit and watch a
[1:27:54] football game
[1:27:56] mr i'm going to tell you what the world
[1:27:57] is all about is going to condemn you and
[1:27:58] throw you in hell over a football game
[1:28:01] bang was lost by the way in case you
[1:28:02] didn't know it
[1:28:05] now you understand that the ideas that
[1:28:07] come from the platform this is why
[1:28:09] preaching must be on target with the
[1:28:11] word
[1:28:15] how are the people going to know what
[1:28:17] lays in their heart true iniquity if
[1:28:20] it's convoluted and confused with this
[1:28:23] part of a man's idea and this part of a
[1:28:25] tradition and this part of a family idea
[1:28:27] and then mix all that together with the
[1:28:29] word of god and then you've got the hard
[1:28:31] task of trying to sort it out and you
[1:28:33] don't even have a gift to preach
[1:28:35] try to give to deserve it
[1:28:39] how many times preachers are going to
[1:28:41] have to stand before that white throne
[1:28:42] of judgment and give an account
[1:28:44] they're being so sorry to the people
[1:28:47] where instead of making time and sitting
[1:28:49] down and learning how to rightly divide
[1:28:51] that word they just think well i don't
[1:28:53] like it therefore god don't like it
[1:28:59] hallelujah anyhow
[1:29:02] ain't gonna let some of these hard looks
[1:29:04] get me down
[1:29:08] and your heart and your mind you may
[1:29:10] think but we've got to be holy based
[1:29:12] upon god's holiness
[1:29:15] do you understand there are people in
[1:29:16] this message that believe that if a man
[1:29:18] wears a colored shirt he's singing
[1:29:22] so every one of you men sitting here
[1:29:24] tonight with anything else but white on
[1:29:26] your ass
[1:29:29] in some people's estimation and sister
[1:29:31] i'm not going to start with y'all
[1:29:33] because all y'all be in bad shape if i
[1:29:35] took the same measuring stick stipulated
[1:29:37] on you
[1:29:38] do you understand what i'm saying to you
[1:29:40] friends how do we know what iniquity is
[1:29:42] if nobody gives us a plain understanding
[1:29:44] of it
[1:29:46] how do i know i'm sitting before the
[1:29:47] lord if it's not plain to me what that
[1:29:49] means and what that looks like
[1:29:57] can i use a simple example i don't mean
[1:29:58] to just summarize a bible story
[1:30:01] but
[1:30:02] think of the woman that caught in
[1:30:04] adultery
[1:30:05] moses said
[1:30:07] get both of them and bring them before
[1:30:10] the people
[1:30:11] when this woman showed up she was by
[1:30:13] herself
[1:30:15] i would love to know god i would love to
[1:30:17] know who the other fellow was
[1:30:21] yeah could have been a local pastor
[1:30:24] as we would say i learned local
[1:30:26] evangelist or teacher or whoever
[1:30:28] could have been one of the
[1:30:30] degrees of the church or the trustees or
[1:30:32] the song leader or whoever
[1:30:34] started the david i'm putting me in
[1:30:35] there too so i'm not throwing it on
[1:30:37] just one
[1:30:39] all of it it could have been any kind of
[1:30:41] god remember the prophet of god said
[1:30:42] ananias and safar were chuck members
[1:30:46] the bible told us plainly that they were
[1:30:48] working with the disciples and they kept
[1:30:50] back some of the money that they should
[1:30:51] have contributed to the work of the lord
[1:30:54] they scheme together right there in the
[1:30:55] message a message church
[1:30:58] until peter caught
[1:31:00] them what'd you lie to the holy ghost
[1:31:03] for
[1:31:04] you see it wasn't the attitude that you
[1:31:06] made the lie it was the intention of
[1:31:08] their heart they intended on doing evil
[1:31:10] and that one evil would have led to a
[1:31:11] thousand more evils why iniquity was
[1:31:13] hiding in that heart
[1:31:18] and when jesus brings this woman up he
[1:31:20] lays right there and and this and writes
[1:31:22] himself something in the sand and these
[1:31:24] guys are throwing the word at him oh you
[1:31:26] could have heard them little message
[1:31:27] chickens pecking him to death the
[1:31:28] prophet said the problem said the
[1:31:30] prophet said
[1:31:32] and jesus just
[1:31:34] sit down and thought a little bit and
[1:31:35] just kind of you know how you do sitting
[1:31:37] somebody talking
[1:31:38] a restaurant you'll play with a a straw
[1:31:40] rapper a napkin or you'll feel around
[1:31:42] with your spoon
[1:31:43] before jesus kind of writes down in the
[1:31:45] sand looks around
[1:31:47] what you want to use without sin
[1:31:49] go ahead and get started
[1:31:52] and i always get this wrong but i think
[1:31:54] the bible said either the eldest to the
[1:31:55] least or the least of the elders they
[1:31:56] one by one just started kind of
[1:31:58] sidestepping like whoop we better get
[1:31:59] out of here
[1:32:03] now these are men that according to the
[1:32:06] to the uh new testament history times of
[1:32:08] jesus and all these other books you can
[1:32:10] read these are men that you couldn't put
[1:32:11] a finger on their life what was they
[1:32:13] condemned for
[1:32:16] why'd they feel under conviction
[1:32:19] hello
[1:32:20] iniquity
[1:32:22] iniquity was hiding in their heart they
[1:32:24] knew they had never fully surrendered to
[1:32:26] the lord
[1:32:28] they were just doing what the like the
[1:32:30] rest of us do i mean in terms of
[1:32:32] humanity we just follow along with the
[1:32:34] program and hope we don't wind up in
[1:32:35] hell
[1:32:40] whew i am preaching tonight
[1:32:43] smack dab in one line land mine after
[1:32:46] another
[1:32:47] i can feel it i know i'm rubbing you the
[1:32:49] wrong way good
[1:32:51] good
[1:32:53] it helps us to learn where we're wrong
[1:32:55] that friends
[1:32:57] are these legalistic attitudes we've got
[1:33:00] oh praise god you know i heard a guy say
[1:33:02] today
[1:33:03] a man wears a pair of sandals
[1:33:06] a man
[1:33:09] i thought
[1:33:11] evidently you ain't never heard the
[1:33:12] story about the ram tells about jesus
[1:33:14] with dirty feet taking the sandals off
[1:33:16] to get them washed
[1:33:21] such foolish behavior as that is only a
[1:33:24] cover
[1:33:26] for the real truth hiding inside their
[1:33:28] heart and that that is there is iniquity
[1:33:30] they've never repented of
[1:33:36] hey
[1:33:37] adultery piece of cake god can forgive
[1:33:39] it
[1:33:40] cigarette habits no problem the lord
[1:33:42] washes it away and doesn't stick a stick
[1:33:44] at it
[1:33:46] but unbelief
[1:33:48] that's the hardest animal for him to
[1:33:49] wrestle with
[1:33:51] and god's a hunter you see jesus is a
[1:33:52] hunter he is on the hunt
[1:33:55] for that old devil that's crawling
[1:33:56] around which is unbelief trying to get
[1:33:58] in the hearts of people
[1:34:00] remember what he said he said smoking
[1:34:01] drinking curse and then things aren't
[1:34:03] sin he said
[1:34:04] unbelief is the only real sin there is
[1:34:10] think about the type i'm using tonight
[1:34:13] cain did what he did not because of the
[1:34:16] action of it paul did the same thing
[1:34:18] that king did
[1:34:19] oh thank you lord never saw that one
[1:34:22] cain was justified i was just as guilty
[1:34:24] of the same thing that cain did he held
[1:34:27] the call of stephen when he stood there
[1:34:29] and watching people stone that man to
[1:34:31] death
[1:34:33] it wasn't the behavior it was what was
[1:34:35] laying on the inside of that heart
[1:34:39] hallelujah
[1:34:41] many people can do things wrong many
[1:34:43] people can behave like a sadder but it's
[1:34:45] what's inside your heart that counts
[1:34:50] oh thank you jesus
[1:34:54] this is why
[1:34:55] if i'm gonna be a real genuine christian
[1:34:57] believer okay if i'm really going to
[1:35:00] serve the lord from the depths of my
[1:35:01] heart
[1:35:02] the word
[1:35:04] is a discerner of the
[1:35:07] thought and the intention of your heart
[1:35:11] do you know why god don't quit fooling
[1:35:12] with us he sees our intention
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:17] oh how beautiful thank you lord jesus he
[1:35:19] sees what we intend to do now what we're
[1:35:21] doing
[1:35:23] glory to god hallelujah
[1:35:26] it's not the i the idealist focus on the
[1:35:30] behavior and the dress and the hair and
[1:35:32] all i know
[1:35:35] what do you intend to be in your heart
[1:35:38] do you intend believer do you intend to
[1:35:40] be a christian then god sees that and
[1:35:43] works by your intention
[1:35:47] oh thank you jesus thank you jesus
[1:35:52] now you and they like me
[1:35:55] whoa hey kill a heart
[1:35:58] and yet at the very same time brother
[1:36:00] sister this is where many preachers in
[1:36:03] the message and the like will follow
[1:36:05] through oh
[1:36:09] see what kind of shoes you're wearing
[1:36:15] air jordans
[1:36:19] nike
[1:36:20] by my god nike is a greek goddess
[1:36:24] why are you a heathen you know how many
[1:36:26] people in this message are the most
[1:36:28] ridiculous idiotic foolish people ever
[1:36:30] walked the face to play all in the name
[1:36:32] of religion and they've never even been
[1:36:34] saved
[1:36:36] come on somebody preach to me tonight
[1:36:39] they've never received the holy ghost
[1:36:41] they've never been born again and yet
[1:36:42] they can tell you everything that
[1:36:44] displeases god when they don't even know
[1:36:46] the man
[1:36:52] i'm going to preach to you the truth
[1:36:54] i want to be able to hear from god like
[1:36:56] we are right here this very moment to be
[1:36:57] able to hear from god about what people
[1:36:59] need
[1:37:00] to hear
[1:37:03] not what i
[1:37:05] think
[1:37:06] that's why when i show up and pull pits
[1:37:08] around the world i don't walk up there
[1:37:09] in that platform and think okay i'm
[1:37:10] going to tell them this i'm going to
[1:37:11] tell them that i'm going to talk i said
[1:37:13] lord
[1:37:14] uh your microphone
[1:37:16] turn it on and go
[1:37:20] i learned something many years ago if i
[1:37:21] tell you how to live
[1:37:24] then the next thing you do when you mess
[1:37:25] up you're going to be trying to know how
[1:37:26] to get redeemed
[1:37:28] how to be reconciled so if i the guy
[1:37:30] that's telling you then you're going to
[1:37:31] need me
[1:37:32] to keep doing it
[1:37:34] there go
[1:37:36] fish for a man you feed him for a day
[1:37:38] teach him to fish
[1:37:40] he's for the rest of his life
[1:37:43] to me brother the whole real bottom line
[1:37:46] of all of this is what is the intent of
[1:37:49] a man's heart woman's heart what does
[1:37:51] god see
[1:37:54] don't forget when he saw i talked about
[1:37:56] that in questions answers about that
[1:37:57] little piano player sitting up there
[1:37:58] with a short dress hair and makeup on
[1:37:59] her face
[1:38:00] all of that would have been so
[1:38:02] displeasing to many people around the
[1:38:04] ranks of this message they would have
[1:38:05] said she nothing but a sinner and she
[1:38:07] don't belong on the platform brother ben
[1:38:08] said leave her alone she's a baby in
[1:38:10] christ
[1:38:13] and you know what the truth be told she
[1:38:14] probably had more holiness in her little
[1:38:16] finger than many i'm having their entire
[1:38:17] christian walk
[1:38:18] so called
[1:38:21] because when you're sin sincere
[1:38:24] and you're honest before god you may not
[1:38:26] always do it right
[1:38:28] but god honors you a whole lot more
[1:38:29] because of the intention of what you
[1:38:31] mean to do
[1:38:34] praise god
[1:38:36] can you imagine what it must be like for
[1:38:38] the lord jesus to look down on all these
[1:38:40] people that think that they can make
[1:38:42] themselves holy him knowing that's the
[1:38:45] whole reason he died
[1:38:48] guys you can't make yourself holy you
[1:38:50] can't your righteousness as filthy rags
[1:38:52] in the eyes of the lord jesus
[1:38:55] amen amen
[1:38:58] so by his holiness
[1:39:01] he come down and he makes something
[1:39:02] different in our heart he changes the
[1:39:04] intention and the attitude and the
[1:39:06] spirit of our heart that's how he
[1:39:09] gets us right
[1:39:10] [Laughter]
[1:39:13] praise god
[1:39:16] so my job is simple
[1:39:19] i keep pointing people in that direction
[1:39:21] until they get there and if they don't
[1:39:23] get there make it so hot they get there
[1:39:24] or else
[1:39:26] and then if they get there and then they
[1:39:28] start fooling around doing things today
[1:39:29] right burn them up
[1:39:32] right oh you all ain't harming any man
[1:39:34] is loud on that one but it's the same
[1:39:36] amen as the other one was
[1:39:38] if you're a believer and you're doing
[1:39:40] something ain't pleasing to the lord you
[1:39:41] better watch out
[1:39:45] cause god ain't gonna take it easy on
[1:39:46] you when he knows you his boy and you
[1:39:48] his girl
[1:39:50] he's a jealous god now
[1:39:54] he won't let you go down roads it's
[1:39:55] going to hurt you or destroy all of the
[1:39:57] plan he has for you in his life he will
[1:39:59] put every roadblock in the way smack
[1:40:01] your mouth if he's got to
[1:40:04] so to speak
[1:40:10] now watch this and say john 8 44. you
[1:40:13] have your father the devil the lust of
[1:40:15] your father you will do that word lust
[1:40:17] doesn't mean sexual now but that word
[1:40:18] lust is desire an illegal desire
[1:40:22] it is a desire that comes from a person
[1:40:25] to get somewhere with something
[1:40:28] that they ought not have
[1:40:32] think of this in terms of how he spoke
[1:40:34] about the lust of the eyes
[1:40:37] jesus had to overcome the lust of the
[1:40:39] eyes what did that mean that means that
[1:40:41] anything that jesus saw that he knew
[1:40:43] would be illegal to the call and the
[1:40:45] walk that god had placed before him he
[1:40:47] had to overcome that lust
[1:40:51] so many of them pharisees probably
[1:40:53] handed him a million and a half dollars
[1:40:55] for praying for somebody
[1:41:01] come on i'll tell y'all something
[1:41:03] i'm not one of these guys that
[1:41:06] i'm not one of these guys that cares
[1:41:08] about the money part of it i get nervous
[1:41:10] if i can't if i feel like i'm not gonna
[1:41:12] be able to make ends meet or bills or
[1:41:13] something's getting a little tight i get
[1:41:15] nervous that way as a leader as a father
[1:41:16] as a husband i always want to make sure
[1:41:18] we're on the straight track and spend a
[1:41:20] little bit too much eating out or too
[1:41:22] much amazon or some of these type of
[1:41:24] things you know and i'll pull the reins
[1:41:25] quick hey slow down
[1:41:29] but i know what the bible said trust the
[1:41:31] lord pay your tithes and your offers and
[1:41:33] god will always take care of you i've
[1:41:34] watched him do it for 20 years now
[1:41:40] so my financial freedom isn't based
[1:41:44] on my day-to-day behavior
[1:41:49] well glory to god i don't have a credit
[1:41:51] card
[1:41:52] whoa glory to god glory to glad for you
[1:41:56] the three quarters this church probably
[1:41:58] here probably does
[1:42:02] you may not tell me you would get into
[1:42:04] debt
[1:42:05] and here we go
[1:42:08] notice how blanketed it was pay your
[1:42:10] tithe offer do you ever start to think
[1:42:12] god don't need your money
[1:42:14] y'all think he's going to be a little
[1:42:15] bit late this month i'm paying the light
[1:42:17] bill for the sun
[1:42:19] dp l and uh these
[1:42:21] so whatever the power company is for you
[1:42:23] you all reckon that he's going to need a
[1:42:25] little help a bump maybe in the tithing
[1:42:27] this weekend so that the
[1:42:29] lord jesus jesus can get the all the
[1:42:31] grass planted for spring
[1:42:34] but y'all look at me so strange
[1:42:37] he owns a cattle on a thousand hills he
[1:42:38] don't need your
[1:42:40] money but you see when a man pays ties
[1:42:43] and offerings he's showing forth an
[1:42:45] intention
[1:42:47] and his intention is i'm going to be
[1:42:49] obedient to god
[1:42:51] simply because the lord asked me to do
[1:42:53] this
[1:42:57] you know you hear people i ain't giving
[1:42:58] that old preacher my tithes that's fine
[1:43:00] keep them
[1:43:02] they ain't really tithing anyways that
[1:43:04] way
[1:43:05] because god loves a cheerful giver
[1:43:07] not a stingy one
[1:43:12] well praise the lord i'll have you know
[1:43:14] right now glory to god ah
[1:43:17] whether tommy works a job he's got
[1:43:19] enough that ain't what god said god
[1:43:21] didn't say you judge based on what you
[1:43:23] see
[1:43:25] he said this is your church that's your
[1:43:26] pastor pay tithes pay offers
[1:43:30] now the point i'm trying to make to you
[1:43:31] is you can start getting into the
[1:43:33] debates of the wise the whats and the
[1:43:34] whos and the winds
[1:43:37] but at the very core of all this god
[1:43:38] said pam
[1:43:41] same thing with living right
[1:43:43] the lord tells me don't do this don't do
[1:43:45] that do this dude but the very the very
[1:43:47] bottom line of all of it is is it in my
[1:43:49] heart to do right yes or no
[1:43:53] if it is and i will do right
[1:43:55] eventually
[1:43:56] [Laughter]
[1:44:00] come on somebody
[1:44:02] down the road i may not get it today i
[1:44:04] may not get it a month from now but by
[1:44:06] the grace of god eventually i'll be able
[1:44:08] to do that thing that's laying
[1:44:10] in my heart
[1:44:12] think of how long it took david david
[1:44:14] cried to god my lord dwelleth in tents
[1:44:17] and look at this big fine castle i'm
[1:44:19] living in
[1:44:22] he cried after the lord for a long time
[1:44:24] and god came down said david you've got
[1:44:26] the right move the right objective i see
[1:44:28] your heart is right but i can't let you
[1:44:29] build it you've shed too much blood
[1:44:34] that thing laying in david's heart laid
[1:44:35] there and laid there and laid there and
[1:44:37] laid there and what eventually happened
[1:44:38] eventually the temple was built
[1:44:42] god determined upon the children of
[1:44:43] israel 70 years that's bible years now
[1:44:47] not 70 literal years as we know but 70
[1:44:50] bible years
[1:44:52] here we are from the time daniel
[1:44:54] recorded that about 4 000 years down the
[1:44:57] road
[1:44:59] israel has been blinded and in sin for 2
[1:45:03] 000 years
[1:45:06] my question to you is how nervous y'all
[1:45:08] think god is right now
[1:45:10] about israel's end
[1:45:12] y'all reckon he's worried
[1:45:15] when trump took office uh-oh
[1:45:18] when biden got in uh oh no that's us
[1:45:23] i most certainly felt that way when
[1:45:25] biden got office but
[1:45:27] that's just my american speaking
[1:45:30] i will say though
[1:45:32] old uncle joe impressed me the other day
[1:45:34] he went over to poland which i've got
[1:45:36] students that i teach in poland all the
[1:45:38] time
[1:45:39] and
[1:45:40] he got over there and he had a slice of
[1:45:41] pizza
[1:45:43] one of the local shops and walked around
[1:45:44] shook hands and kissed babies i was
[1:45:46] proud of him you know what he let no big
[1:45:48] mouth putin over there no we ain't
[1:45:49] worried about you
[1:45:51] when you could peacock peacock
[1:45:56] i was i was proud of him because i
[1:45:57] thought at least he ain't acting like a
[1:45:58] coward
[1:46:01] uh-huh
[1:46:06] but the attitude becomes this well
[1:46:09] i'm a believer but
[1:46:11] no no no
[1:46:14] rewind
[1:46:17] go back a little bit
[1:46:18] i'm a believer stop
[1:46:22] mark chapter 16. anybody ever why you
[1:46:24] don't raise the dead anybody ever wonder
[1:46:27] why you're never laid hands on sick and
[1:46:28] they've recovered anybody please put
[1:46:30] your hand up
[1:46:31] anybody wonder why you never spoke with
[1:46:32] new tongues if you see a few hands going
[1:46:34] up
[1:46:35] does it trouble you
[1:46:38] you know why white troubles you for the
[1:46:39] same reason trouble with me you're
[1:46:41] reading too far
[1:46:44] what you should do is you should stop
[1:46:46] where it says
[1:46:47] he that believes
[1:46:49] if you're a believer just
[1:46:51] let god take care of the rest of that
[1:46:54] because that being a believer part is
[1:46:56] way more important than what are you
[1:46:57] raised dead or not
[1:46:59] come on
[1:47:01] i'm almost out of here i'm getting ready
[1:47:02] to parachute
[1:47:03] like jewel
[1:47:06] he that believeth and is baptized now we
[1:47:09] get to this this idea well glory to god
[1:47:12] if i'm bride if i'm a real believer i'm
[1:47:14] going to raise the dead just be
[1:47:16] concerned with being able to get your
[1:47:18] hands raised in church in the corners of
[1:47:20] your mouth raised up when everything's
[1:47:22] going wrong just be concerned with
[1:47:24] raising your cup up to the lord every
[1:47:26] time you come and let god do the rest of
[1:47:28] it if you're a believer it's up to him
[1:47:31] when and how and what you will perform
[1:47:33] and what you will
[1:47:34] do because listen to me if you never
[1:47:37] raise the dead if you never speak in new
[1:47:39] tongues if you never lay your hands on
[1:47:41] the sick and they recover that doesn't
[1:47:43] take away the fact that you are still a
[1:47:45] believer
[1:47:51] what we've done folks
[1:47:53] and i don't say everybody now i'm
[1:47:55] lumping this quite a bit tonight
[1:47:56] generalizing quite a bit don't
[1:47:58] misunderstand me i believe there's godly
[1:47:59] people godly men around the world has
[1:48:00] got this right
[1:48:02] but there's a greater far greater amount
[1:48:04] of these other type of sermons that we
[1:48:06] hear that discourage us
[1:48:09] every time you hear somebody speak about
[1:48:11] the third pull you don't know what to do
[1:48:13] with that
[1:48:14] how do you apply that to your daily life
[1:48:18] when's the next time you're going to be
[1:48:19] in sportsman hollow and need some
[1:48:20] squirrels to eat and got to create them
[1:48:26] the whole point of god showing us those
[1:48:28] things to brother brown wasn't so we've
[1:48:30] become a bunch of mimicry
[1:48:33] to show sons of god that when and
[1:48:35] daughters of god when they are in need i
[1:48:37] don't mean to leave you outside
[1:48:38] daughters of god too to show that when
[1:48:40] you are in need
[1:48:42] take no thought for what shall be given
[1:48:44] for in that hour the holy ghost will
[1:48:46] give it to you
[1:48:47] because when your life story is road and
[1:48:50] the third pool is expressed in your life
[1:48:52] it may come in a much different way you
[1:48:54] might just be looking at old broken
[1:48:55] tractor and you may need that old
[1:48:57] tractor to work and you may just speak
[1:48:58] to that thing in jesus name you start
[1:49:01] out and there she goes
[1:49:03] that's just as much third paul as amen
[1:49:06] get speaking the storms come on somebody
[1:49:09] but what we've done is we've placed our
[1:49:11] vindication upon what we do not what we
[1:49:15] are
[1:49:17] i am not
[1:49:18] a christian because of what i do
[1:49:21] i'm a christian because of who i am
[1:49:24] [Music]
[1:49:25] hallelujah
[1:49:27] and if i am a believer then godly things
[1:49:29] will express out of me holy things will
[1:49:31] express out of me holy behavior and
[1:49:33] supernatural works of god will express
[1:49:35] through me if i'm genuinely a holy
[1:49:36] ghost-filled man
[1:49:40] but not based on what i think will
[1:49:42] happen
[1:49:46] let me show how this works
[1:49:48] please
[1:49:49] i want you to express yourself in a
[1:49:51] moment if you're guilty of this let all
[1:49:53] the rest of us see just you stupid as i
[1:49:55] am
[1:49:57] okay
[1:49:59] it's raining you hate to rain or it's
[1:50:01] bothering you got some kind of problem
[1:50:02] how many of you
[1:50:04] come on
[1:50:06] i said i command you you look around to
[1:50:09] see if anybody's looking
[1:50:11] see he told you people in here so stupid
[1:50:13] as i am
[1:50:17] and somehow in our heart we have
[1:50:19] established that if god would let us
[1:50:21] stop the rain somehow that makes us
[1:50:23] spiritual wait a minute wait wait wait
[1:50:25] don't think listen
[1:50:27] what about that everyday grind that you
[1:50:29] live and you still serve god in spite of
[1:50:31] all of the disappointments and started
[1:50:33] all of the the down-hearted stuff and
[1:50:35] all of the rotten stuff and the mean
[1:50:37] stuff that happens in your life how you
[1:50:39] discourage your own self how you get
[1:50:41] discouraged with your life and your walk
[1:50:43] with god and yet you get up the next
[1:50:45] morning and go head long right back into
[1:50:48] that kind of life still calling on the
[1:50:50] name of jesus to help you live and make
[1:50:52] it another day what about that to me
[1:50:55] that's more powerful than stopping a
[1:50:56] rain
[1:51:04] how often do people get in this mode
[1:51:07] to where they think if they're spiritual
[1:51:10] they have to raise the dead listen
[1:51:12] and i got to quit time's gone
[1:51:14] john
[1:51:15] was the one that recorded
[1:51:17] in that there matthew was the one that
[1:51:19] recorded in that day he will come to me
[1:51:20] and say lord lord didn't we do
[1:51:24] and he called him workers of iniquity
[1:51:27] why did he call him a worker of inequity
[1:51:30] because that's what was in their heart
[1:51:33] just because they could tap into enough
[1:51:35] faith to do something supernatural did
[1:51:36] not make them a christian and it
[1:51:38] certainly didn't make them spiritual
[1:51:43] of course we would see that scripture we
[1:51:44] go amen but wait a minute you can't say
[1:51:48] one thing about a certain set of works
[1:51:50] unless you said about all of the works
[1:51:53] so be just
[1:51:55] you see people that live better than you
[1:51:58] come on admit it you do
[1:52:00] christians that live higher than you so
[1:52:02] you think
[1:52:04] because they look spiritual talk
[1:52:06] spiritual walk spiritual
[1:52:08] people walking around
[1:52:10] bible underneath their arm and they're
[1:52:12] speaking in these and vows and we go oh
[1:52:14] my that's a real christian
[1:52:16] that is a hollywood trumped up not
[1:52:19] donald trump a trumped-up version of
[1:52:21] christianity and there's nothing
[1:52:23] spiritual about it
[1:52:25] a brother friend of mine down in south
[1:52:26] carolina brother gary hall
[1:52:28] he was with brother branham in los
[1:52:30] angeles and i loved what he told me the
[1:52:31] other day he said you know brother ben
[1:52:33] he said a lot of people put brother brad
[1:52:34] in this high category he said i met
[1:52:36] brother branham in 19 and 16 62 i think
[1:52:39] it was
[1:52:41] and he said when i walked up to shake
[1:52:42] his hand he stunk
[1:52:44] because he'd been standing there
[1:52:45] preaching on the prayer line i had been
[1:52:47] going he'd been standing that hot
[1:52:48] california son he said i could spell
[1:52:50] smell perspiration on him a mile away
[1:52:54] he said he stood there and talked to me
[1:52:55] and spent one out of the side of his
[1:52:57] mouth the brother had some broken teeth
[1:52:59] and at that particular time his parcel
[1:53:01] was all messed up and he spit a little
[1:53:02] bit when he talked oh i don't see this
[1:53:04] kills our image of what we think is holy
[1:53:09] but that has not got one thing to do
[1:53:11] with being holy or holiness in general
[1:53:13] all that is
[1:53:15] is a thing we have created in our mind
[1:53:20] and what makes you holy is the fact
[1:53:24] that nothing is in here
[1:53:27] that displeases the lord
[1:53:30] don't get me wrong when it comes to your
[1:53:31] adoption your behavior will determine
[1:53:33] whether god can trust you sure
[1:53:36] but don't get your cart before that
[1:53:37] horse you make sure this right here is
[1:53:40] right with god and clean with god and
[1:53:42] all of that foolishness is out of here
[1:53:43] before you start trying to work out here
[1:53:46] remember what he said in the book of
[1:53:48] john if a man's heart don't condemn him
[1:53:51] but he said if his heart condemns him
[1:53:53] god is greater than that
[1:53:55] meaning the lord's got control over all
[1:53:57] these things that's why i just choose to
[1:53:59] surrender to him instead of trying to
[1:54:00] fix it
[1:54:02] praise god i should have never told you
[1:54:04] i was getting ready to close because
[1:54:05] it's getting late now you're wanting to
[1:54:07] get out of here
[1:54:10] you fooled me i'll hold you 20 more
[1:54:11] minutes just to be angry just be
[1:54:12] spiteful
[1:54:16] think about the condition of a man's
[1:54:18] heart when he comes before god
[1:54:20] david said forgive me of my sin my
[1:54:23] presumptuous and sacred unknown sins
[1:54:26] there are things that maybe god would
[1:54:28] hold against us that we don't even know
[1:54:30] is wrong
[1:54:34] and yet how am i supposed to keep track
[1:54:36] of all that
[1:54:38] if i woke up first thing in the morning
[1:54:40] i got me a pencil and a paper and i
[1:54:41] started trying to keep track of
[1:54:42] everything i thought was wrong and by
[1:54:44] the end of the day i had rolls and rolls
[1:54:46] of papers that's just full of lists of
[1:54:48] things that i've done wrong before the
[1:54:49] lord
[1:54:50] you know how much that concerns god
[1:54:53] he lets me go to sleep and brother john
[1:54:55] i get up the next morning and i go again
[1:54:57] i guess i'd have to start a new book
[1:54:59] but what we do
[1:55:01] is we make a library of our sins
[1:55:04] so when we go before the lord in prayer
[1:55:06] we're trying to do something spiritual
[1:55:07] or a man's preaching to us
[1:55:09] like this we've got all kinds of
[1:55:11] compendiums
[1:55:12] we've got all kinds of volumes and
[1:55:14] series and levels of reading we've got
[1:55:17] books thicker than encyclopedia war and
[1:55:20] peace and all of it put together
[1:55:22] of the things that we've done wrong that
[1:55:24] we feel like is displeasing to the lord
[1:55:26] but listen
[1:55:28] the prophet of god said when abraham's
[1:55:30] divine commentary was wrote
[1:55:33] god didn't include anything that abraham
[1:55:36] might have taken notes on
[1:55:38] glory
[1:55:39] he eliminated all of that
[1:55:42] you know they said in world war ii that
[1:55:45] one of the advantages that hitler took
[1:55:47] over the jewish people was he had a book
[1:55:49] burning you know what i think we need
[1:55:50] right here tonight i think we need to
[1:55:52] build up a fire the holy ghost and i
[1:55:55] think we need to take them old
[1:55:56] compendiums and encyclopedias glory to
[1:55:59] god and burn up in the fire the holy
[1:56:01] ghost and say god i'll no longer look at
[1:56:04] my own sins and my own what i want to
[1:56:06] read your notes on me rather than my own
[1:56:09] notes on myself
[1:56:15] because you know that one little thing
[1:56:16] that you do or those two little things
[1:56:18] you do or those six little things you do
[1:56:19] that you go through the day and you
[1:56:20] think i'm so stupid
[1:56:23] why can't i get myself straightened out
[1:56:24] you know god don't look at the way you
[1:56:25] do
[1:56:28] do you think
[1:56:29] you having an irritating little way
[1:56:31] about you
[1:56:33] some little irritating little thing that
[1:56:35] happens all the time and it's a
[1:56:37] besetting thing
[1:56:39] do you think that tiny little thing that
[1:56:40] you struggle with is such a big concern
[1:56:42] to god when he's got to keep the world
[1:56:44] turning keep the sun turned on he got to
[1:56:46] feed tens of millions of birds every day
[1:56:49] and you think that little attitude you
[1:56:50] got
[1:56:51] is a big deal to him
[1:56:55] words say man in case y'all forgot it
[1:56:58] no no no see it's a big deal to you
[1:57:02] that's because you keep notes on
[1:57:03] yourself
[1:57:06] but when abraham's divine commentary was
[1:57:08] wrote
[1:57:10] god never even referred to not one
[1:57:11] volume not one series or not one
[1:57:13] compendium that abraham wrote on himself
[1:57:17] when paul penned it down he said he grew
[1:57:19] strong staggered not i can point you
[1:57:21] right to the old testament a few
[1:57:23] different times he staggered
[1:57:25] would you like me to remind you of hagar
[1:57:27] would you like reminder of where ishmael
[1:57:29] come from
[1:57:30] a very time an evident time the prophet
[1:57:33] said
[1:57:38] oh you see you're being a smart like no
[1:57:40] that's the attitude people take about
[1:57:41] many of these things when they're so
[1:57:43] legalistic that it's got to be word by
[1:57:45] word
[1:57:48] much of this bible right here you're
[1:57:49] never going to understand it and if you
[1:57:51] get it figured out you're still wrong
[1:57:54] the real key to being able to live this
[1:57:56] word is to let god be his own
[1:57:58] interpreter for you
[1:57:59] for you not for everybody else and their
[1:58:01] brother and the dogs and the chickens
[1:58:02] for you
[1:58:04] but god interpret those things for you
[1:58:09] and here moses the prophet is telling
[1:58:11] abraham
[1:58:12] listen to sarah
[1:58:14] do you understand that sarah was out of
[1:58:16] the will of god suggesting that he go
[1:58:18] sleep with a concubine come on now
[1:58:22] ishmael was a wild man and the bondwoman
[1:58:24] cannot be heirs with the free
[1:58:28] and yet when paul writes it
[1:58:32] he grew strong giving god praise
[1:58:37] staggering not at the promise of god
[1:58:44] i'm done i don't think any of y'all can
[1:58:45] take any more anyway
[1:58:48] if i'm going to be right with god
[1:58:49] brother david i've got to come to this
[1:58:50] conclusion
[1:58:52] that whatever i'm doing before the lord
[1:58:53] it must be based upon my intent to do
[1:58:56] the right thing
[1:58:58] and if i've got the right intent if it's
[1:58:59] in my heart to do the right thing then
[1:59:00] god will help me work out all those
[1:59:02] details i can think of a thousand times
[1:59:04] i've looked back on my life in this last
[1:59:06] couple weeks i've been thinking back on
[1:59:08] things i didn't look at my life i can
[1:59:09] tell you right now there's been many
[1:59:11] times god's been lenient with me on
[1:59:13] certain little battles i fight
[1:59:15] he's giving me a space to work it out
[1:59:16] things are happening all the time i'm
[1:59:18] battling some certain little thing maybe
[1:59:20] it's a you know an attitude
[1:59:23] i know it's hard to tell that i would
[1:59:24] ever have an attitude but yeah i get
[1:59:26] them sometimes
[1:59:27] i get so aggravated people i like to
[1:59:28] slap them right in their teeth i like to
[1:59:30] hit them as hard as i can hit them say
[1:59:31] you are so ignorant what's the matter
[1:59:32] with you
[1:59:34] you know why i'm like that i love people
[1:59:37] i've committed my life 31 years this
[1:59:39] summer i've committed to the service of
[1:59:40] god's people and i've committed my
[1:59:42] entire life and you know when ain't
[1:59:43] nothing gets on my nerves worse than to
[1:59:45] tell them how to fix it watch them break
[1:59:47] it again
[1:59:50] so then i gotta go for the lord
[1:59:52] well
[1:59:54] are you there god it's me margaret
[1:59:57] ain't now y'all ever read that book
[1:59:58] right
[2:00:00] the looker always goes back before the
[2:00:01] lord are you there god it's me margaret
[2:00:04] the way i feel sometimes brother john
[2:00:06] are you there lord it's been again
[2:00:11] but i look back on i see how much
[2:00:13] leniency
[2:00:15] he could have whipped me
[2:00:17] he could have spanked me he could have
[2:00:18] dealt with me and said change your
[2:00:20] attitude or else
[2:00:23] but he let go on he let it go on he let
[2:00:25] more people aggravate me more people
[2:00:26] aggravate me more people thank you lord
[2:00:28] and i'm also aggravating to them i'm
[2:00:30] sure but i don't want to know about that
[2:00:31] part i'm not interested at just how they
[2:00:33] aggravate me it's all i care about
[2:00:36] hello
[2:00:38] your side's awful it's human and that's
[2:00:40] the fight
[2:00:45] you know how it is
[2:00:49] hey man
[2:00:55] good you've
[2:00:57] been to that person look how they've
[2:00:58] treated you
[2:01:00] and there was the fight then you have
[2:01:02] the struggle and struggle okay lord help
[2:01:03] me help me help me then you see that
[2:01:04] brother or that sister and you hear
[2:01:07] that you know things they've said and
[2:01:08] they never come to you about you know
[2:01:09] it's funny
[2:01:10] people when they hear things they never
[2:01:12] go to the guy or the girl
[2:01:14] they will ask 14 people if it's true
[2:01:16] before they pick up the phone and ask
[2:01:18] you about it
[2:01:20] and every time they get through that 14
[2:01:21] people to get through that big telephone
[2:01:23] they've done created
[2:01:25] it don't look nothing like the original
[2:01:26] and the guy that said it in the first
[2:01:27] place don't remember what he said
[2:01:32] i'm sorry grace i'm driving you crazy
[2:01:34] having to move that camera move that
[2:01:35] camera
[2:01:38] see
[2:01:39] she won't be mad at me tonight that guy
[2:01:43] but the point i make it to you folks is
[2:01:45] a lot of times the lord jesus will see
[2:01:47] those things he sees my heart
[2:01:50] i don't want to be short in my spirit i
[2:01:53] don't want to be irritated in my spirit
[2:01:55] no when i love people and i see him
[2:01:57] doing things that's wrong and aggravated
[2:01:59] and i want to see him do better so what
[2:02:01] do i do i fight and i wrestle struggle
[2:02:02] with me until i can get that thing under
[2:02:05] control get to surrender the lord until
[2:02:06] i can come to a place where i can
[2:02:08] legitimately honestly walk into prayer
[2:02:10] and pull that person up before the lord
[2:02:12] take them up there with me shoulder and
[2:02:13] shoulder and say now god you've helped
[2:02:15] me get my attitude right now help this
[2:02:17] brother get himself straightened out
[2:02:23] we put ourselves in such a bad position
[2:02:26] over and over and over again because we
[2:02:28] think it's our job to keep track of what
[2:02:32] we do
[2:02:35] you all ever hear about the marriage
[2:02:36] ceremony
[2:02:38] when the woman stands there
[2:02:40] in the old testament she stands at
[2:02:42] midnight when they do the ceremony
[2:02:44] takes her veil and she lays that veil
[2:02:46] across his shoulder
[2:02:48] the reason she does that is because
[2:02:49] symbolically she's telling everybody
[2:02:51] that's witnessing this marriage i am no
[2:02:53] longer responsible for me
[2:02:57] you got the holy ghost
[2:02:59] how many got it put your hand up like
[2:03:00] that
[2:03:02] yeah
[2:03:03] you know what you're saying
[2:03:04] you are no longer responsible for you
[2:03:10] he is responsible for every day-to-day
[2:03:12] thing
[2:03:15] so i should just quit worrying about
[2:03:16] things
[2:03:17] i don't but i should
[2:03:20] and i should trust him
[2:03:22] to be able to help me get one foot in
[2:03:24] front of the other and walk right
[2:03:26] what happens if i
[2:03:27] what's up good you mess up good question
[2:03:30] repent make it right go on
[2:03:32] we get so distraught because we do it
[2:03:34] guess what you're gonna do it again
[2:03:37] and if it ain't that it'll be something
[2:03:38] else
[2:03:44] well that's that's altar call
[2:03:45] expressions right there
[2:03:49] don't beat yourself up
[2:03:51] stop being the one that's got that
[2:03:53] catholic spirit on you to give yourself
[2:03:55] the cat of nine tails every time you
[2:03:57] mess up
[2:03:59] just go back to god and say lord you see
[2:04:01] mine
[2:04:03] you see what i'm trying to do
[2:04:06] help me do it
[2:04:08] stand with me let's let's quit here i've
[2:04:10] kept year five to nine again
[2:04:15] one of these days i'm gonna learn to
[2:04:17] shut up
[2:04:20] i'm sorry
[2:04:22] you gotta work and all these other
[2:04:23] things and here i am go go go go go
[2:04:27] let's pray
[2:04:28] many wonderful things were presented
[2:04:30] before us
[2:04:31] and i want to give you grateful
[2:04:34] in thanksgiving and
[2:04:36] sweet praise to you lord for speaking to
[2:04:38] us so clearly
[2:04:41] because lord the the subject tonight's
[2:04:43] divine healing i'm talking about healing
[2:04:45] of the soul of course
[2:04:47] help us lord to
[2:04:49] understand that if the soul is not
[2:04:51] completely healed of this stroke of
[2:04:52] iniquity
[2:04:55] will never be able to manifest perfect
[2:04:59] perfect faith perfect love
[2:05:02] and even perfection as you said matthew
[2:05:05] 5 48 be ye perfect
[2:05:08] oh god how will we ever get there
[2:05:10] if this soul condition isn't healed
[2:05:13] help us lord
[2:05:15] lord they're just like me i'm just like
[2:05:17] them we get discouraged when we do
[2:05:18] things that we think is displeasing to

[2:05:22] i'm glad i've got conviction i'm sure
[2:05:23] they're glad they feel convicted when
[2:05:25] they do things wrong but lord jesus
[2:05:28] help us to draw a line in the sand
[2:05:29] between
[2:05:32] what you see and what we see
[2:05:35] help us rightly divide those attitudes
[2:05:37] and spirits when we see humanity working
[2:05:39] on us help us lord not to be so critical
[2:05:41] of ourselves that we can't even pray
[2:05:43] sometimes
[2:05:45] because we make ourselves feel so
[2:05:47] unworthy when the reality is we could
[2:05:49] make ourselves feel worthy
[2:05:51] it takes your blood your righteousness
[2:05:52] your cleansing to do that
[2:05:55] we're not feeling worthy because we make
[2:05:56] or feel or we're
[2:05:58] we're basing it upon what we think is
[2:06:00] worthiness
[2:06:02] and lord i pray you will help us get
[2:06:03] this divided in our hearts tonight
[2:06:06] and may everyone under the sound of my
[2:06:07] voice may you bless them
[2:06:09] and encourage them and strengthen them
[2:06:11] by these words that were spoken here
[2:06:13] tonight
[2:06:15] and god let us walk out of here tonight
[2:06:17] with a new vision for our lives and a
[2:06:19] new
[2:06:20] perspective on how to live before you

[2:07:08] well
[2:07:09] may the lord bless you greatly
[2:07:15] [Music]
[2:07:24] to run
[2:07:36] with god
[2:07:38] [Music]
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:49] in a
[2:07:50] secret place
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:07:55] there in the spirit
[2:07:59] [Music]
[2:08:01] beholding
[2:08:03] his face
[2:08:05] don't you want this
[2:08:11] [Music]
[2:08:16] [Music]
[2:08:19] to be shotted
[2:08:23] as they played quietly think about this
[2:08:25] a moment when aaron's rod was in that
[2:08:28] presence of god it was a stick
[2:08:30] behave like a stick acted like a stick
[2:08:32] as that's what it was
[2:08:34] but when the holy ghost come upon that
[2:08:37] element the elements and the components
[2:08:39] and the structuring and the
[2:08:41] fibers of it all the science you can
[2:08:43] throw at that stick
[2:08:45] when god looked out of that stick and he
[2:08:46] got it in the presence of god he brought
[2:08:48] things out of it
[2:08:50] that that stick could not bring out of
[2:08:52] itself
[2:08:54] why because that rod was intended by
[2:08:57] creation's purpose
[2:08:59] to bring forth flowers to bring forth
[2:09:01] fruit to bring forth god created that
[2:09:03] seed to bring forth of its kind it
[2:09:05] couldn't do it on its own
[2:09:08] but when it got in the presence of god
[2:09:10] god gave it the power
[2:09:12] to live out its predestination
[2:09:15] i didn't get to it brother bram said
[2:09:16] that's why you can hear the word
[2:09:19] because you're predestinated for that
[2:09:21] purpose
[2:09:22] hallelujah
[2:09:26] there
[2:09:28] in the spirit can you imagine this
[2:09:31] beholding
[2:09:34] [Music]
