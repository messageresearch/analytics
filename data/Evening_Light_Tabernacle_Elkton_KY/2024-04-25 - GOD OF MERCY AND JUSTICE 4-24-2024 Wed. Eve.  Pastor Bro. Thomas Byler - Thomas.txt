speak to our hearts Lord we just pray father that once again you do it again this evening Lord you'll speak to our hearts father things but that you once said Lord father what wherever Lord if it

Lord in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen how many here is glad for God's healing amen I'm glad for God's healing amen praise the Lord amen amen my heal my body when I was sick he surely been good to me amen praise the Lord all right let's um turn our bibles if you will to Matthew the 19th Chapter Matthew 19 it was quite something how that I was um thinking about this scripture amen and the bearing of it and I thought Bo that would make a good title and then uh I got to thinking about something else and and the Lord seemed to lay something on my heart to speak on tonight amen and it went back right back to this same scripture amen so the Lord works in mysterious ways isn't that right so we'll read this scripture in Matthew 19 for for a little bit tonight amen Matthew 19 and verse 16 and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one and that is is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight I want to speak on the goodness the justice and the Judgment of God Amen that's my title the goodness the justice and the Judgment of God Amen praise the Lord amen amen brother baham says it this way he says so now he says we want to know that it's all the goodness of God and as our gracious brother or Roberts has well placed it God is a good god he certainly is and now we know that he is a good God Amen but we don't want to depend on that too much on that remember he's a God of Justice too because his Holiness requires him Justice and his laws must be met amen his requirements must be met amen listen here he says we hear so much today about God being a good God he is but he's a god of wrath too he's a god of judgment he's a God of Justice and his Holiness requires Justice it behooves listen God to be just because he's holy he judges and condemns the same as He blesses amen wow it's kind of different in I've got to thinking about the goodness of God how many knows God is good and I'll I'll read one more one more quote here God is a good god I've heard that so much till I get sick God is also a God of Justice he ain't a whole Doty grandpa that can be pushed around and his grandkids don't have any sins amen grandkids sometimes for us Grandpa they can't do any that's okay if they do that Mama pick him up pick him up and whoop him good you're like a that's a doie old grandpa greaty old grandma ain't that right dirty old not dirty Doty amen I have to admit I'm a little bit that way amen a little bit too much amen but God's not that way is he no God's not that way and I want you to know that every good gift comes from God every good thing comes from God Amen and everything that we have everything that we possess amen our very life every breath that you take it's a gift of God Amen how many believes you God is a good god and that's what I want to start off with amen that God is a good god and even Jesus said when he was asked he said good Master what must I do he makes he he corrects the fellow and he says you know there is only one that's good Oh Brother Steve you're so good brother Tom you're so good brother Brad you're so good we'd say no even my wife has little song she beginning to write about you know any good that you see in me is him how many believes any good in any of us it's not you it's him any good that you see in any of us cuz if it was up to us us we'd be a bunch of Thieves and robers and we'd stab each other we'd shoot each other we'd be murder are you with me there would not be one good thing about us in our carnal nature we're a bunch of Rascals we're are lost we've got the wrong to Nature to begin with and we even we as professing Christians have a hard time conquering that old nature it still likes to rise up amen it takes the power of the Holy Ghost to suppress that thing Amen to keep it under CU it still wants to keep rising up but amen we think about it it would how many knows that we could sit here all night and all day tomorrow as a matter of fact let me just say it this way it'll take us all of eternity to praise God for his goodness cuz every good gift everything that we got our Salvation it come from the goodness of God you didn't have to die for it you didn't have to go on Calvary for it you didn't have to be beat you didn't have to have strip on no you got to give until you're afraid that's a good God Amen praise the Lord think about it amen the very God that brought us here the very God that allowed Adam and Eve to come here and they were there in the beautiful Garden of Eden enjoying the goodness of God Amen but what did they do but fall what did they do but sin hello how many know she just deviated on one word she just had one little sin and it caused all the whole fall do you realize that you when you sin just a little bit just one Disobedience of his commandment and you're as guilty as the was come on people he didn't have get put that on her and then not you that's part of the reason why he said don't lean too much on his goodness because he's also a just God he's a holy God his Holiness says amen requires judgment in other words he has certain laws and certain rules amen and there has to be Justice brought to every Commandment that is broken you can be the best preacher in the world you s against God and you're cut off right there till you repent you g the Holy Ghost away he's gone until you get that right there's no respector a persons amen I thought that's right he is just as much a god of judging and condemning as he is is in blessing amen praise the Lord listen to what he says they say oh he's a good God he is a good god yes but don't presume on that he's a God of Justice too he's a good god like a little teenage boy said not long ago said you know God is's so good that he just don't care what I do what do you reckon brother bam said I'll tell you what he said he said said nonsense nonsense God don't love you so much that he allows you to sin no he don't everybody listening out there world are you listening isn't it something that God put man and Humanity on such a basis amen that he has certain laws and certain responsibilities amen and he'll give an account for for every thing that he does Jesus said that a man will give an account for every Idol word that he speaks every action that we have every thought that go through our mind every word that we speak you've got to give an account for not other words our human being we are accountable people they can try to ignore it amen they can be an atheist but they will give an account you will give an account for every deed every action that you ever did that requires you God's justice and re judgment requires it because you can accept the goodness of God or you have to accept the wrath of God you have to there's no choice you either accept his goodness or you accept his Wrath oh taste and see that the Lord is good amen God is good all the time he puts his song of Praise In This Heart of mine now God isn't always good huh no not when you're bad no don't you tell let preachers tell you God will bless you it doesn't matter if you sin or you don't that's a lie he won't let you be lost but he'll get it God isn't that kind of a god otherwise he might as well give them a pass you realize that if he lets you get a pass he'll have to give them all a pass he is just God is just there's no Injustice in almighty God and it's quite something for us ministers to be able to declare to the world you will give an account the Bible says that God has so Vindicated himself alive in our day we know it's coming judgment is coming the white Throne judgment is coming W that even makes us Christians Shake right we don't want anything out from under the blood why because how many knows that we come into the house of God brother bam said that this is the house of judgment amen and some man's sins go before unto judgment W aren't you glad that you're taking care of it now while there's a tu of bleach amen for your sins and your false to drop in there's forgiveness for you amen some men follow after oh that's going to be a scary day when men s follow after come up behind them you did this message Believers you did this and you that that you never repent of but how many know people will give an account on the day of judgment you don't make things right you will make it right one day amen praise the Lord what his goodness mine you love his goodness I love his goodness when I think of the goodness of Jesus and all that he has done for me then my soul cries out praise God for saving me amen when you think of the goodness of God Amen and how that man I should have been a homish boy I should be driving a horse and buggy but God allow turmoil in my family and me where when I of there he got me out of there I got in a deep my clay and it was God that picked me up amen out of the deep my clay he saved my soul lord Lord Lord you surely been good to me you say must when I was lost you surely been good to me and I'm going to have all of eternity to praise you for your goodness thank you Lord he made butter taste so good amen aren't you glad that you don't have Co and you can't taste I learn about you but I like to taste don't you God put those taste buds in here for us to enjoy bible says that God has given us freely all things to enjoy amen listen folks I got wrote down in my my notes here you know how many believe that before the foundation of the world God seen he me he even told job where was you when the SARS of God and the sons of God shouted together is that right when they shouted where was you job you was in my mind I thought of you shouting amen tonight I want to ask you something are we worshiping are we praising him are we shouting the way that he thought that we would I'm getting ready I don't want to wait till I get over there to start shouting to start praising God for worshiping him all these things we say sometimes it seems like so perhaps so uh not deep or whatever it might be but you know what the problem is with things all these simple little good things that God gives us like breath every day amen thought of brother Brian I thought of me brother Joe all of us we're not so young anymore amen 62 years old I don't know about you with FR GL I was glad to hit 60 I was like w thank you I know a lot of people didn't make it to 60 when you get all you appreciate every day you know that every day is a gift of God that's a blessing can I say something else not just every day but every hour every minute is a blessing from God every breath that we have every breath that I have I'm going to sing of the goodness of God with every breath breathe and use it for so much other stuff brother Glenn God been good to you how old are you now 76 years praise the Lord God's been good to him three score and 10 isn't that right is that 70 and anything above that well that's just the grace of alight you're just living in the mercy and the grace and the goodness of God how many believe that's what we're living in can I say something the whole world is living in the long suffering the mercy the goodness of God they're enjoying the goodness of God don't they realize that those beaches or those mountains whatever it is that you like amen the air that we breathe the sunshine that we take in the beautiful days that we enjoy the we enjoy the mobility that we enjoy all things are the good of God it's all off the hand of God we don't even realize that don't appreciate take it for granted let's be done Tak it for GR am the problem is B says let me see here if this is the right one yeah what we need to do is call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we've accepted the Bible we have accepted great truth of it but it still is not real to most people now how many knows you know that which is not good depression fear anxiety guilt condemnation nervousness despair all those feelings em those things are real but how many knows that salvation the Holy Ghost joy peace gentl we need to have it real I don't want to just say I'm a Christian there's so many people that so lightly take it I'm a Christian that means you're Holy Ghost filled that means you're delivered from sin that means you are to have the joy of God in your [Music] heart that's right I shoot a big old book bread I grab a hold ofs yeah huh to come to church y I guess it's all right no this is so much greater how many needs a reality well that's what the messy people believe that we that's what we need we need it to be real we need joy to be real I don't want know nothing about that sorrow that depression and all that I don't want that you ain't got to have that you can have be victorious over that how many believes you can live in Victory every day you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day you don't have to fall short no you can live and walk with God like Enoch walked that's what we want the goodness of God the American dream I thought man it's for having Prosperity Home and so forth I thank God for my farm I thank God he's given me much more than what I could ever imagine I thank him for that but what I want more than anything amen is the American dream Not The American Dream but the Christian dream amen John Martin Luther he had a dream but we have a dream and that is to walk with God that's to talk with God to be like anoch was amen and just to walk with God until he wasn't and to be like even the prophet of God in this hour ain't that right speak to that squirrel speak this speak to the mountain and it'll be so that's my dream my dream is to walk with God every morning I get up every morning you get up devil has to get a notepad out he's got to start scribbling man he lives so close to God I don't know what to do with him trying to figure it out but I don't know what to do I this at him I that at him guess what he just THS me just says get out get behind amen that's the kind of dream we have why because we're not content in this world this is a terrible world to live in we want to live in an eternal Place amen oh we love our spiritual world world where we're in but not this natural world this inner man just wasn't to be here in this Devil's Eve where there's all kinds of murders and killings and horrible atrocities is that right not just among the human Kingdom but in the animal kingdom isn't that right The Killing and the all my eating each other and everything else that goes on I long when all of that is will be done by the wayside amen all right all right so we think about it we either have to accept his goodness you had to have it's either Mercy or it's judgment it's either goodness or it's the Wrath why I said you know that God well let me just read it to you I want God to be good God all the don't you I want to live in that world his goodness leth thee to repentance the goodness of God leads you to sorrow and repentance that's why the Holy Ghost is so important in a marriage hello because if one of them is defective if both are defective have a lot of defects unless they got the Holy Ghost they'll never want to correct those defects they'll never want to change they'll never change but the Holy Ghost will say honey on both sides I don't want to be that way I'm sorry I'm that way I'm telling you God can work in something like that aren't you glad that love the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what he does the goodness of God leads us to repentance the goodness of God he says as many as I love I rebuke I chasen amen but I don't want to always have the chastening of the Lord I don't always want to have the rebuke of the Lord I don't want to always have to be corrected I want to be correct how many's with me I don't want to always have to repent I already it amen how many wants to stand where the fire has already been that's right when the preacher comes up here and tells you man everybody's going to give an account for everything they do you can say w Glory I confessed everything before I bet to went to bed last night I confessed everything this morning God forgive me of anything I ever done wrong it's under the blood and I'm standing where the fire is already be I ain't got to worry about the fire I ain't got to worry about the Judgment amen but I don't like what that preacher says I'm getting out the door not coming back wow that person is really GNA be a good person he is really GNA become righteous he is really going up there in Christ isn't he no don't sound right does he sounds like whatever he went out with is what he's going to keep for a while amen just like Brother Brad we get the little bitterness if a little bit of bitterness comes between us something little H or you or anybody you let that little thing stick in there and harbor hello you're the one that's going to beer until you get it straighten out until you get that little thing out amen that's the way it is with God folks why because God doesn't want one sin he wants you without spot and without wrinkle how many believes you can live that way every night before you go to bed say God forgive me when you get up if I dreamt something wrong forgive me Lord if I thought something wrong amen there's blood there to keep us washed brother bam said that if you make a mistake and you confess it God never saw it in the first place you're perfect long as you're repenting as you go he says you're perfect that's what he said come on people isn't that awesome isn't that to know oh my that's great to know amen that's why we aren't having to live Amen in a darkness in a dismal day aren't you glad that God didn't leave us into in in a confused Babylon what religion what church what Baptist Church Methodist Church Pentecostal Church Amy Church which one should I go to which one is right oh I just don't know amen and you get in the Bible and you interpret yourself and everything else and you're going to have your own denomination but no God comes and brings a prophet on the seene vindicates the word says quit thinking your own thoughts what God Said that clears it all up how you glad for the goodness of God God rich in Mercy Mery and quickened you and I brought us to life we who were once dead in sins and trespasses he has quit because he's Rich how many you God is rich in Mercy go back in Psalms and find out for his mercy endureth forever for his endur Mercy end forever he is such a merciful god trying to W the thought through my mind but I want to say I want to say that God is a 100,000 times more merciful than he is wrathful in judgment that's just a thought that went through my mind huh I don't know if it's true or not went through my mind he's more merciful I don't think that I don't think that thought's wrong why because remember the 490 times a day that he forgives if his judgment and his Mercy was equal he'd say well I'm going to give you one chance not three strikes I'm G take I'm gonna make it equal you get one forgiveness and then if you fail here's judgment but no how many times have we fail God is still merciful god still forgives Lous the Bible says in Mercy he only brings judgment because he has to because people will keep jumping over the barricades he blocks them in every way to stop them from going to hell he's not willing that any should perish so he tries to stop him him in every way he can if you finally make it to hell you had to fight your way there amen if you burn in hell just remember this you had to fight your way there you had to fight your conscience first of all you didn't have a preacher didn't even go to church every human being has a conscience don't you kid yourself huh he's there to condemn you amen my my my AR such good God is is also God jice Like War I mean warning is Mercy isn't a warning Mercy hey don't do that watch out it's Mercy like the man in Florida remember he had that farm ain't that right typhoon was coming his neighbor begged him come on leave leave leave no no I heard that before no well let your wife and kids go no she's my wife and I'm the head and so for so forth and what did they do but die on the roof his wife and kids and he never was never was found why because he warn he spurn the warning and God when he brings he comes and he provides a way of Escape for people a way of Escape for the world and for 2,000 years with Noah it was 120 years are you ask me it was 120 years for Noah's day but it was 2,000 years for ours 2,000 years of saying the Lord is coming the Lord is coming Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready the Lord is coming 2,000 years of people very merciful very gracious but he's coming he does you and I church amen Maks and heion Arad I think of the good of God I think of where he says seek first the kingdom of God his whatever youire will be added like yourself I told you this before I'm going tell you again I'm getting to be an old man I can repeat myself a little bit ago living up in El I thought it would be nice to have a little farm a little old tractor maybe a little Ford tractor some kind of tractor maybe a little bushog just you know this that or the other with about a 10 foot stream you know or something flowing down off the property or something like that I said should be nice today look at what he's G a river just every day we I I I don't know what to do just thank you Jesus amen I was in my shop the other day and I was trying to do some painting and I found the roller cover and all of that garage and everything I knew I had a a a roller to put that cover on somewhere and I couldn't find it nowhere and I said Lord can you help me find a roller cover sure enough I looked around looked around looked around looked around looked up on the shelf and there's a bucket up there and I remember being at Lowe or somewhere and it was on sale and it had every kind of thing for painting in that bucket it had the brush I needed it had the roller I said Thank You Lord how many believe God is real he answers your prayers amen this spring I was thinking I'm going to need some hay I'm G to e some hay this summer amen and I want to get some really good hay Lord I told my wife I don't know where we going to get some or or just what we'll do this year and so forth and I said Lord and I went down to an Amish guy and he says you know I got this hay and I'm cutting it and uh uh uh it's where Donna was buying her flowers Aaron and

that's the song we want to sing God is good all the time the only time that he has to come amen and do things that amen is unpleasant to us perhaps it's when we have amen discontent or when we have uh uh Disobedience and things like that amen let's look at the Judgment for just a minute amen I'm here to tell you I'm glad to serve a real God I don't want to just come up here and say well he's the same yesterday today and forever I want to I want to experience that he's the same yesterday today and forever me the little things in your life ask God say God I don't care if it's a roller I don't care what it is say God help me you're here with me amen and God answers praise the Lord oh my now notice look at him today let me go back up here and talk about Israel for minute right here it is now you say well God's a good God God is a good God but we hear too much of that today God is a god of wrath he's a god of judgment he was good enough to go down there and to take Israel right out of the mouth of death is that right look at what he did for Israel amen when they left there they had an absolute Pentecostal Jubilee no doubt but the whole place rang out with great songs of Amen Redemption and and deliverance and they praised God going out is that right now notice out of the mouth of death and then turned right in the wilderness and let them Rock because they wouldn't follow him ain't that right only two out of two million and he said you let them out there and he says you're going to go out there until you're all dead even Jesus speaking of them he says they're everyone total separated from God completely lost why because they thought they could do this they thought they could do that how many know we as Christians don't you transgress the laws of God and expect not to be punished for it or to have to repent for it I and get forgiveness for it amen I was kind of quiet on that oh but think about it that's right because it wouldn't follow God was a good God to pull you Pentecostals out of them organizations but you turned right back around and called and acted like your momy so now you're rotting in it oh this tap tap record's going there's a tape recording going on here it goes around the world you know I I'm not so much just speaking here he says but you rot right in it amen let me know it's the Pentecost look at where they were look at where suzu Street was at one time amen and pretty soon they got all divided and all he's coming on the White Horse and the cloud and got all of that amen when any church ever becomes a denominations you sit there and you R God ain't in it amen help judgment God the justice of God isn't God completely different than what people think wasn't that one Minister going around with some woman amen that was divorced about four or five times and he said something God loves her so much that he just forgive her for all that she's like a virgin now says that might be he had a dream wasn't it either dream or Vision that God was that way nonsense is that right you you know it didn't come from God the devil he had the devil's dream that night amen just like people think they can do anything and get away with no car about Litt DET you don't take nothing home tonight than this God cares about the dets in your he wants to walk with you he wants to walk with you evening night Tabernacle he wants to walk with every one of us every day every minute of the day he wants to bless you ain't that right how many believe we are blessed we are blessed we are blessed every day that I live when I get up in the morning I'm blessed when in the middle of the day I'm blessed when I lay my head to rest I am blessed Amen brother BR says we don't want God's justice when I was studying this I thought you know every time you and I fail God every time you sin you ought to be Zapped like a bug and a bug zapper the wages of sin is what death that's what we deserve amen when we fall short but the goodness of God boy you ain't heard

me go I'm going to tell you some say I was little Revelation amen God puts barricades up he put road blocks up amen for certain people amen and they go over and go over and still go to hell but God
