of the Lord this morning aren't you thankful that you got a Manger in your heart that the Lord can lay his head down in it's a good place to be with the Lord laying in your lap so we just want to be drawn close to God I tell you we we could uh just read a scripture this morning after those songs that was sang we could go eat lunch because uh the songs were so good and they tell the story and and they illustrate what what we got on our mind and on our heart and we want to speak to you this morning and and uh just take a little time we'll try not to hold you long and they sang the song The the Noel song there and I thought about that and and I just want to look up I thought no well what you know we we hear it we hear it we hear it but what is it and as I looked it up I found out that no well is used in language after language after language after language and every time it's used in a in a in a different language it has a little bit of a different con connotation about it but it all points back to the same thing Noel it says it can mean news the news has come it means Christmas it means birthday it it it it it it means uh uh the Christmas season so we you take no well and it looks back and you say man here we are the good news of Jesus Christ born a savior in a world in a sick and Dying World a savior who's come into our hearts and into our presence that's good news that's good news so we're just thankful for the for the word and for the songs that we're sang this morning if you want to turn in your Bibles we'll look in Luke chapter 1 and look in Luke chapter 1 and I'm going to continue my thought I think there's another Sunday before Christmas but I do just I'm just and maybe brother Bower is going to preach us a Christmas service I'm I I'm assuming maybe I think there's another CHR Another Sunday before Christmas right so but I want to continue my thoughts and stay with the theme that's going today and and I know we having our den Calvary and as you're turning there I know you got your place let me read you this quote it says it it all comes by the spirit but Jesus was virgin born in order to Tabernacle the holy spirit of God first to manifest himself to the people and he gave his life a willing sacrifice that through his righteousness we unrighteous people might have a right to come into that Fellowship like he had with the father before the foundation of the world he said isn't that Grace and Glory what he did for us then to think that that day that we're living in that so many people cut up cut that privilege off from the people he says my wow we're living millions of miles below our god-given privilege we should never live under our privileges as we are today great powers of God lays within the reach of every member of the body of Christ how many is a member of the body of Christ great Powers lay Within each and every one of you who claim to be a part of the body of Christ whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you shall receive it and you shall have it and it shall be given unto you praise the Lord Luke 1 verse 30 and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conce receive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end think about that as for his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing that Holy thing that which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we're thankful Lord Jesus for this day you've given us for the opportunity to come and share the word and the thoughts that you've laid on our hearts and share the songs of of praise for the Thanksgiving of the Christmas season that we have uh uh that you were born and and and you come down to live in our hearts to dwell in us to to be there for us and lead us and guide us and and through the good and the bad L Lord you you came for us and we thank you for that we want to give you honor we just dedicate this day to you and just ask that everything be said would would be pleasing to you and would would would be to bring glory and honor to you and we just ask Lord that you allow me to get myself out of the way my nerves out of the way and just speak what you've laid on our hearts Lord and that the hearers myself included would receive what you'd have in store for us we love you Lord with all of our hearts in Jesus name amen you can be seated think is that big G back there sir last time you was here we prayed for you to come out of that wheelchair he walked in today [Applause] amen so here we are we get into our thought here praise the Lord the Christmas season has come upon us and Christmas decorations they began to go up well before Thanksgiving and Santa Claus started making his appearance Brother David at the malls we was in the mall the other day and there's Santa Claus and social media and the advertisements have doubled and tripled and quadrupled trying to get you to buy and buy and buy to buy stuff to buy try to get you to buy things uh to get you to buy into the world's rendition of Christmas A lot of times there during this season they're we're encouraged they they try to get us to buy things that we can't afford they try to uh get us to buy things with money we don't have they try to get us to buy presents for people we don't even know if we really like some of you caught that but that's the commercial side of it that's the commercial side of what what Christmas has has become and and and and no doubt it's here to stay but brothers and sisters I tell you this one thing this morning there's one thing we can't afford to be without and we can't be without Jesus Christ we can't be without the Holy Ghost living inside of us that manger that we're talking about living on the inside of us because what we need in this Christmas season is Power from on high we need power from on high that conquers every enemy we need power that that overcomes the challenges and sicknesses and afflictions we need a God and a gift of Deliverance a gift of Deliverance that delivers those that are bound by the things of this world we need a freedom from fear and anxiety and depression that pulls our Spirits down into darkness this is a little bit different what you was expecting from a Christmas service wasn't it but what I want for Christmas this year is I want want more of Jesus Christ I want more of the gift of God in my life I want more overcoming power you see the the social side of Christmas has begun the festive time the festive time when we all dress up you look around today and we got matching colors I tell you what don't y'all look good praise the lord we dressed up you know I look my wife got on black and red so I had to put on gray and red and had to try to match and look at these couples over here matching and my goodness look at even got Brothers matching over here matching daddy and mama so this festive season has started to to get up on us here and and we we're getting ready to go to parties we're having a dinner today right so we're getting ready to go and have these parties we're going to enjoy ourselves we're going to spend time with family and friends and we look forward to those things I love Christmas I have even dressed up as Santa Claus it was fun and we enjoyed to do these things out of the light-heartedness but for many I want you to think about today this time of year can bring sadness this time of year can bring loneliness and this time of year can bring a feeling of emptiness I've heard three or four different stories in the last couple of days of people who's really not looking forward to the Christmas season really not looking forward to the Christmas season because the sadness it brings into their lives people who has lost people at the this time of year memories of loved ones that have gone on times of hardship that you you you reflect back on during the Christmas time not being able to give the way you want to give so it brings a sadness it brings a heartache and sometimes those emotional challenges begin to build up but the the message today is is for you the message today is for all of us that need to be able to overcome these kinds of emotions we're people we're emotional we have emotions so I challenge you today don't let these emotions keep you from remembering the little Christmas package that was wrapped up in swaddling clothes laid in a Manger don't forget that package don't let that emotions get you and hold you back because that is the most important package that was ever delivered to the face of the Earth anticipation we have anticipation about these packages if you're a little child you're in a you go in you see that there's a new package under the tree what's the first thing you do you go look at the name tag y'all want to know if it's mine and so with anticipation you look and you see your name on that package and you pick it up and you shake it and say man this must be good listen at it in there I know it's a good one it I would be a box of rocks but your anticipation makes you think man this is something really good and then if there's a bigger package oh this one's better than the other one I want to open this one first and your anticipation begins to grow in this package but here's this little Christmas package wrapped up in swaddling clothes with so much anticipation of what was going to happen in the world to come so here is God now wrapped up in this package let me tell you this is a package worth waiting for this is a package worth opening this is a package worth getting in there and diving in and say this is mine you claim this package so here we are in this Christmas season and and and we think about Christmas and the things that go on and and I I seen this little story and I got to share it with you just to kind of break some ice and some tension and there was a guy in Utah that decided he's going to send out 600 Christmas cards to total strangers 600 Christmas cards to total strangers so he goes and he gets a the post officer gets a directory of several cities around him and he starts picking out these addresses and he writes out 600 Christmas cards to people he's never met in his life never seen never met never talked to and on these cards he puts his return address and so he goes out and he mails them puts them in the mails and puts them in the mail and and you know but here's the thing is out of 600 cards he received 117 returned cards come back to him somebody wrote something to him and what's what's funny from these responses from all these strangers listen to this now one lady wrote it was good to hear from you your card arrived the day that I come home from the hospital and I can't tell you what an encouragement was to hear from an old friend another one wrote I have to admit listen to this I have to admit when we received your card we couldn't really picture you we had to think hard for a long time before we remembered by the way please give our regards to your father he's such a wonderful man Christmas season this is the best one this is the best one the guy wrote it was good to hear from you after all these years by the way we're going to be in Salt Lake City next summer would it be all right if we came by and spend a few days with you so be careful who you send your Christmas cards to you may get some replies you're not expecting but Christmas is going around in happiness and joy and we think about that and this month is filled with sounds of Christmas bells everywhere you go the bells are ringing ringing choirs are singing and and music is filling the air but in the midst of all this joyous sounds of Jolly holly Christmas season there's other sounds too there's sounds of Anguish and sounds of grief and sounds of suffering and despair so let's go back and we'll look back over 2,000 years at the very first Christmas and and see if we can see this in Bethlehem and and we'll hear some of the sounds of going on in this busy Inn you know he comes to the end it's busy it's a busy time of the year the animals are in the stable and and the angels are singing and and and shepherds are coming to see the baby in the manger and probably Mary's voice in a soft lullab but can you imagine what Mary's voice in Her lullab would have been if she could have really sang and really know the song Mary Did You Know if she really knew what she was what she was holding in her little hands if she really knew the anguish that he that was going to have to go through Jesus's life for the next 33 years you see we forget those things we forget those things we forget that as a human being Mark Lowry who wrote the song Mary Did You Know was able to tap into a little bit of that vision and see that Mary was holding a baby so precious but that this baby would go through so much anguish and distress in his life and the prophet said thinking of Bethlehem he said why did it have to be in Bethlehem why did it why did he choose birth the birthplace of Bethlehem for the King of Kings he said you know it's a very small place a small town and he said I've often wondered why God didn't choose some more religious Place such as Shiloh where the where the first tent was placed and the Ark was set and after it crossed over Jordan or gilgal another great religious City or Zion on the mountain another great religious City a proud capital of Jerusalem with all of its sages and Saints why didn't God choose Jerusalem why would he choose Bethlehem he said maybe it looked like that he may have chose some place of of a great City of Refuge now think about this that would that he would have protected his son in case some trouble came now you know there's there's times Brothers and Sisters Jesus had to push through the trouble he had had to push through the times he had to push through from the from the time of his birth he had to to go through hardships and hurts and pains he had to experience all that why did he have to experience that because you experienced that he had to know what you go through before he could die for you so now we see that Bethlehem has significance he couldn't be in some protected Refuge of a city where nothing could ever bother him or troubles could never come so we had to look at Bethlehem why God picked little Bethlehem and not choose one of these greater cities he says let me tell you he says because you know God has a way of doing things just like his own way about things I'm so glad he does sometimes he takes things that have no spiritual background or have any background at all and that's why he's God because he can take something that's nothing and make something out of it God takes you and I people who are of nothing and make something out of it and that's why he had to go to Bethlehem little Bethlehem he says that's what makes him God that's what makes us love him that's what makes poor people appreciate him because even though we're poor with no background yet God can do great things with us if he ever gets us under his control do you see why it's so important that you're under the control of the Holy Ghost that you're under the control of God's Will and God's way I don't want my will I don't want my way but I want God leading and guiding and moving in my life you want to talk about Christmas miracles you want to talk about Christmas miracles we kind of have that little joke around our house if boys do something or we do something we never do oh it's a Christmas miracle maybe y'all don't do that we do it's a Christmas miracle the boys pick their shoes up out the floor it's a Christmas miracle they took out the trash are you with me but we have we talk about these Christmas miracles but we through Christ are the Christmas miracles your life sitting here today is what a real true Christmas miracle is you know you could have been anywhere you could have been anything you could have done many things in your life but God chose you to be a Christmas miracle so the word Bethlehem let's break it down he says Beth means house l means god elham means bread he says so the house of God's bread how fitting is it that for the bread of life to come out of Bethlehem which is is the house of God's bread what a beautiful story what a beautiful story to know brothers and sisters that Bethlehem is a reminder to us that no matter what we go through in life no matter what we're going through today the very bread of life has been given to you the very bread of life you don't have to fear death anymore you don't have to fear death anymore you don't have to fear cancer you don't have to fear heart disease you don't have to fear diabetes why because fear and defeat is a word that we don't use because we are part of that Christmas miracle Luke Chapter 2 if you want to read along I'm going read verse n and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid thank you Carson and the angel said unto them what's he say fear not for behold I bring you good tidings I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people some people no all people behold fear not I bring you good tidings good things good things are going to happen when you follow the lord Jesus Christ good things are going to happen when you cherish that Christmas gift that was given good things I bring great joy for unto you unto you so I want you to say For unto me for unto me is Born This Day in the city of David a What A Savior and I looked up that word Savior and it says the simple definition is one who saves from danger or destruction you've been given somebody that saves you from every every danger that there is destruction death pain penalty are you with me our our Pulpit here says be courageous fear not for I am with you and this shall be a sign unto you that you shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger so this package is is wrapped up and it's it's hidden away it's to be unwrapped at a later time to reveal what's in it isn't that right you have to wait and you have to wait and you have to wait Paul you get a present and you look at it and you think man I want to know what's inside so bad if I if if I could just catch Mom and Dad away I may just have to peek in here right say no say no but that's the way it is and here is this package wrapped in swaddling clothes to be revealed in his true manifestation in days and years to come down the road glory to God now I want you to watch this suddenly there was with an angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising God praising God saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will towards men that angel was like these kids oh praise God this is something big and the angels are beginning to declare what is about to happen it says and it came to pass when the Angels were gone away the Shepherds said to one another let us now go into Bethlehem and see this thing which is to come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us [Applause] what's he saying I've got something for you I've got something for you I've got something for the depressed for the downhearted the Brokenhearted the discouraged I've got something for you who is lost I've got something for you who has lived in such a way that you could feel like you could never come back I've got something for you but now let's fast forward a little bit time goes on and and the sounds of of of of joy and and excitement have now been been replaced with SH shouts of soldiers and cries of children and wailings and anguish of mothers you know uh to understand what I'm talking about you have to realize that for several months or even a year had passed from the time that this all began to start now Mary and Joseph and Jesus they're not in a stable anymore he's a small child they're not in a stable anymore and and here they are in a small house in Bethlehem and here come the Magi the wise men as we call them they come to worship him and you know the story in Matthew 2 we won't pull it up but I'll just rehearse it Matthew 2 13-18 if you're making notes listen to what happens when the Magi leaves Bethlehem to return to their Homeland when they had gone the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and he told him get up get up you've got to get out of here you've got to take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt now you're going to have to stay there until I tell you because Herod is going to search for the child and kill him that old Grinch That Old Grinch what was he trying to do he was trying to steal the gift of God he's trying to steal the gift of God he's trying to steal Joy he's trying to steal hope he's trying to steal your love your happiness your overcoming power he wants to kill it and snuff it out so that you could never have any manifestations of God Almighty so he gets up he takes the child he takes Mary he takes the and during the night and they leave for Egypt where they stay until the death of Herod comes and and and so it was fulfilled at what the Lord had said through the prophet out of Egypt I shall call my son you see how the scripture works it never leaves us hanging it never leaves us hanging because you see brothers and sisters all of this that we're talking about and everything we've described it's all talking about part of the King's Highway scriptures have to be fulfilled prophecies have to come to pass are you with me so for there to be a savior there had to be a hunted down child of God and this child is hunted down and when Herod realized that that he'd been outsmarted and outwitted by the Magi he became Furious right he became Furious and he gave orders I want these people gone I want you to kill every boy under the age of two in this city and the surrounding cities you talk about putting out a decree you're talking about trying to get rid of a of something you didn't want to to manifest he's going to annihilate a whole race of of young boys just to get to one but the Bible says that was when it was said through the Prophet Jeremiah Was fulfilled a voice was heard in R RMA weeping and great moaning and Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because they are no more you see we don't look at this side of Christmas but the reality is this is what Christmas is about this is where Christmas is really about it's not about a Santa Claus it's not about an elf or an elf on a shelf or a trump in a White House it's not about any of those things it's not about reindeer no more than the Easter's about an Easter Bunny it's about what happened in the land of of the of uh Bethlehem to get Jesus on the road to Calvary wailing and weeping mothers crying over the loss of their children so this this this scripture tells us tells us of an insecure and insane Old King who feels threatened he feels threatened because he knows that there's been another King born so when we talk about the sounds of Christmas maybe we need to remember the the shouts of soldiers the cries of children The Wailing of their mothers [Music] for these are part of the Christmas sounds pain I preached a Christmas message one time on Mary and the pain she must have felt as she watched Jesus walk to Calvary that was a Christmas message but that's true you know in order in order to have Deliverance somebody had to be bound there's there's there's negative sides to Christmas but those negatives turn into positive for there to be Joy somebody had to have sorrow for there to be good tidings somebody had to suffer for there to be healing somebody had to be sick before there was a miracle there had to be a mountain to overcome some of us are facing mountains we need the gift of Christmas right wrapped in swaddling clothes for the Lost we had to have a savior in order for me to ever find my way to heaven I had to have Jesus Christ there's no other way around it you can try to come up with Creeds and dogmas and pledges and put your name on books but until you have Jesus Christ until you've been baptized in Jesus Christ's name and you've been buried and your sins are gone on and you come up a different person your life begins to change that's what it means to be lost and to have a savior that's right and all of these are part of what God is trying to remind us at this season and if that's so what what is God trying to say he is he suffering this world is going to happen suffering in this world is going to happen but he said if you suffer in this world I'll bear it with you you see that's the difference is when we begin to look at it in the right light yes I may have to suffer I may have to go through things I may have to go through hardships but God promised me he promised me that I will go with you if you're suffering I'll bear it with you if you're hurting I'll bear it with you you remember the story of King uh King of England when he came through the British Columbia in Vancouver and and the prophet tells this story and he tells it says all the schools let out all the schools leted out to see this King and the Canadian people they wanted to take time and be loyal to their King and they go out into the streets they gave all the little children the flags the flags of the country and so all the school children were there and they were waving their flags and they were hooping and hollering and and all hell to the king God blessed the king God long lived the king and the kids come back to school and the teacher is looking and she's taking a headcount you might say and she realizes one of the little girls is not there and she gets frustrated she says where is Martha and they said I don't know we she was just with us she was just down on the street but she's not here now we got to go find Martha so the teacher and the children they all go out to go try to find Martha and they're looking around every corner here and there and the teacher runs through the streets and finally she sees Martha standing over at a telegraph pole with her head against the pole her hands head in her hands and she's crying in Weeping and weeping and weeping the teacher picks her up and says Martha honey why are you weeping didn't you get to wave your flag to the king yes yes I waved my flag to the king well well didn't you get to say your Praises To The King yes I got to say the praise and to the king so why are you weeping and she said you know teacher I saw the king but I was so little he didn't see me I'm so little he didn't see me but that's not the way it is with our King Jesus that's not the way it is I don't care how little you are how little you do whatever the smallest thing you can do and you know about God sees you he knows every little heartache he knows every little disappointment he knows every little pain he knows every little thing that you have going on and he still God and he still loves you and he still knows you you see that's a good thing he says our Lord he meets in the Realms of man sometimes he meets in great groups of men think about this sometimes he meets with a few he says one time he come and he met with 500 after the time of his resurrection and then we have a time where he met with 70 he met with 12 he met with three and there's times that he just meets with one aren't you glad you're that one aren't you glad this morning that you're that one that through all that he sees all the world person after person after person that's he knows exactly what you're going through the world may not know it that's right the world may never know your hurt your husband may never know you're hurting your pastor may never know you're hurting your brother your sister may never know you're hurting but he knows that's the one thing about God you cannot hide from God no matter what you're feeling what you're going through what you're hurting whether you're happy whether you're sad whether you're praising whether you're doubting he knows what you're feeling and he knows he you're never too little for God to know and we believe we believe that the Bible is the unfall word of God right so when it tells the story of Christmas it's not only telling about angels and Shepherds and wise men and Gifts of gold and frankincense we sang about it frankincense and Mer but he's also talking about a king and soldiers and the murder of little children you see it's telling a journey J from a Manger to a cross can you imagine what it was like to have been a parent in Bethlehem at that time can you imagine what it was like to have your your son you you've got a little boy and you've been a waiting anticipation and now he's maybe 18 months old and he's captured your heart you've watched him you fed him you've nursed him you've watched him grow up and he's crawled and now he's pulling up and he's walking and he always says Dad Dad and now all of a sudden the soldiers burst into your home and they begin to search through room after room after room after room and they're trying to find what they know you've got hidden your prized son your prized boy that you you've wanted and cherished so much and you've got him hit and they come in and they grab a hold of him you want to talk about anguish but that's part of the Christmas story too part of that Christmas story is God gave His only begotten son that whosoever should believe in him shall not perish but have what everlasting life that's what part of the Christmas story is bringing out we may still have anguish we may still have anguish during the Christmas season no doubt many will suffer no doubt many are going through things in their life and the the joyous celebration is not going to be just a joyous celebration but pain but Christmas christ comes to a suffering world and he tells us and and lets us know that God doesn't just he doesn't always guarantee to take away our suffering but he Bears it with us I read this story and found it and stuck out to me and you think man this is not much of a Christmas story but listen to it eleazer wisel it's a Jewish author he wrote a book entitled night he was a a a slave laborer in the World War II German concentration camps and he writes about the Holocaust and he writes about things that happened to him during the war and he he tells how his father was was a more of a humanitarian type and he encouraged him to learn Hebrew and and to do unto others and he says his mother was more of of the believer type and she encouraged him to study the word and and to serve serve God and and to be faithful and in March of 1944 Germany occupied Hungary and and and they begin to come in and they begin to extend their their territory into the Holocaust and went into Northern Transylvania now weissel is 15 years old and he is he's he's captured along with his family and the rest of the town's Jewish population and they're put into one of two concentration camps 15 years old immediately they were sent to asts his mother and younger sister murdered on the scene wetel and his father were selected to perform labor as long as they were able and when they wasn't able anymore they would be sent to the gas Chambers and he tells in his story in his autobiography he tells he said my main motivation for surviving Asha was knowing that my father was still alive I knew that if I died or letting my father know I was still alive I knew that if I died he would die and he said they taken uh taken us to to bersin Wad and his father died before the camp could be liberated so now he's on his own 15 years old and he tells the shame that he felt when he heard his father being beaten and he was unable to help that's a place called Calvary can you imagine the pain and the suffering that Jesus felt on the cross of of Calvary and he's being beaten and he's being beaten and beyond recognition and the blood is Flowing out of his vessels and out of his brow and off of his forehead and his father looks at him and says there's not a thing I can do for you one evening he returned after a day of Labor and he looks out and they as the group come in they discover and they see that there's three Gallows set up into the into the front front area of the of the camp and they look at these Gallows and there's three prisoners are going to be executed and in order to get their point across the guards had orders to force all the prisoners to watch the executions two of the victims were men but into the horror of what was about to happen the prisoners saw that the third one was only a small boy a small boy hanging between two men fixing to take his place on The Gallows and the noes were then put around their necks and and as they were put around their necks the three were made to stand on the chairs and then the chairs kicked out from underneath them instantly the two men died the boy be to gasp the boy began to struggle for Life the boy began to to pant and try to catch his breath he wasn't heavy enough for the news to take action for 30 minutes he said we watched this boy struggle to live and he said in the crowd after the boy had finally died 30 minutes later he said behind him there was a man that cried out and said you say there is a God where is God now and he said immediately the thought came to his mind and he turned around and he faced him and he said I'm looking at God right now I'm looking at God as that boy hangs between two men God never left him God never forsook him God was with him God was even in him to the end of his life and that's the way it is with Christians God is with us he's in us and to the very end we will not be forsaken our God is Not beyond the stars our God is not not off in some Far Away Heavens he he's not right there but he came down here with with us suffering with us hurting with us bleeding with us that's the message of Christmas I think of uncertainty I think of uncertainty when I think about the lives of Mary and Joseph as they hurriedly packed up all their belongings and and they they get ready to leave to go to Bethlehem and leave Bethlehem and go to Egypt and Mary and Joseph begin to flee to Egypt not knowing where they would stay how many of you ever go on trips not knowing where you're going to stay one time that's was the last time wasn't it that ain't no fun I've done that before too called the cockroach in where we stayed but Mary and Joseph flee in Egypt they didn't know where they were going to stay it was a life of uncertainty they didn't know what the future held for them they didn't know what was going to happen happen all they knew was God was leading them I don't think God LED my wife to get that hotel for me just putting that out there but Mary and Joseph they just knew they were being led they've been told by an Angel that Jesus was to be the Savior that Jesus is going to save the people from their sins but what was their responsibility how were they going to raise the Son of God what did the future hold for them but uncertainty uncertainty you see our lives are uncertain teenagers your lives are uncertain you begin to question what am I going to do am I going to finish school am I going to go to college am I going to am I going to get married am I going to am I what am I going to do is this the one for me is that the one for me do I even need to get married and on and on and on and on it's a life of uncertainty where am I going to work what kind of job am I going to do am I going to be a businessman am I going to do this am I going to do that am I going to be a carpenter am I going to be a plumber you see what I mean it's it's a life of uncertainty so all these things begin to get uncertain but one thing about it you don't have to wonder you just put it before God and you just wait for something to happen you see life is uncertain but Mary and Joseph had one great Advantage they knew that God was leading the way and God was going to take care of them you see young people that is what you have to do in your life you have to say no matter what goes on I don't know if I'm going to pass or fail if I'll find him or her I don't know but one thing I know if I will put my life first before Christ come on parents help me preach if I will put my life first before Christ all the uncertainty won't matter here's this little Jesus jostled back and forth in on his journey to Egypt struggling jostling back and forth on the donkey to get to Egypt only to find out that one day he'll tell multitudes about the birds that the birds don't worry about where they're going to eat that the lies they don't think about nothing they don't care if they're clothed they just do what they do lies just do what they L birds do what they do Christians just do what Christians do we don't have to worry about the uncertainty and as Believers we have an advantage man to know that while we don't know what tomorrow holds We Know Who Holds Tomorrow you say I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow God knows he holds it he holds your future Paul so uncertainty is a Christmas message and finally there's death there's death in our world there's death in our world but God came to overcome it you see there was a brutal death long ago in Bethlehem and the cries of the children pierced the air innocent children victims of an insane King but there was one child one boy child that was saved and he was carried away off into the land called Egypt and that one child would someday become a victim himself 33 years down the road he would find himself on a road called Calvary and because Jesus became the sacrifice for our sin death was now defeated death is defeated you see that there is no death in our world did you hear what I said as a Believer and as a child of God there is no death in our world there may be Death Around around us people may go may cross over but Christians do not die if you believe they do you're really you're believe in the wrong message because Christians do not die and here is Jesus walking down this highway walking down this highway that is fit for the king to travel and this highway he's walking down is a Highway for the King of Kings and the Lord of lords now when I think about this highway it's a highway I should have been walking are you with me this road that he's walking is my road this road he's traveling was my road it was my sins it was my shortcomings I'm the one who drove the nails in his hands I'm the one who put the crown on his head what's this man done the crowd cried what's this man done and you hear the dragon the prophet tells the story The bumping coming down the cobblestones and you hear the bumpity bumpity bump and you see the little frail body of about 120 PBS with 120 lb cross on his back and his head pressed up against the side and he says he's coming down the streets and you hear Bump by bump byy bump of that Old Rugged Cross and as he's coming down the street you notice uh he said you notice a little while that the the the robe he's wearing that's throw it over his back without seams he said they took him up there and they brought him into vulgarity they made him naked now do you see what opening the present's all about at once he was wrapped in swaddling clothes he was a baby in a manger and in that manger he was everything that he ever would be all the potential poal that ever that Jesus would ever be was right there wrapped up but now all of a sudden he's exposed before the whole world that's the gift of Christmas Calvary is the gift of Christmas Calvary is where you overcome depression Calvary is where you overcome the gift of your sanity Calvary is where healing takes place Calvary is where where you're released and you're free from the sins of your life that's Calvary that's the gift of God and he says he you see him fall and and he's on this road to galtha and he's going up to the hill and you see that bee buzzing around him and he said that bee is buzzing around him and saying I'm going to sting you and he says that bee is telling him it won't be long now you're going to Calvary do you still want to go can you imagine when when he asked him do you still want to go and he said no Joe needs me Paul needs me Gideon needs me Caleb needs me John needs me Troy needs me do you still want to go yeah that's my children that's my family G needs me and that's how much he cares as he walks down there bumpity bumpity bump and the prophet says that's the love of God how he unfolded himself how he became the Christmas package he became the PRI the Christmas package he was laid on the straw the first thing he pressed his little head against was a straw and the last thing was a crown of thorns he says that's the Christmas package they they took a dirty Rag and wrapped it around him and beat him and said if you're the prophet tell us who hit you and then they tacked him to the cross with love reaching out those hands were symbolic of the world the weight of the world and how he would surround the world with his love father forgive them can you imagine father forgive them they don't know what they're doing that Bee's buzzing around but as that bee began to sting Christ Prophet says that Stinger was pulled out now that bee that buzzes around you and say it says I'm going to take your life I'm going to take this I'm going to take that that bee no longer has a stinger so the sting of death no longer exist and that's why Paul could say death where is thy sting oh great where is thy Victory it's because the sting of death has been removed and Jesus wins the battle you see brothers and sisters death is real it's always been here suffering is here it's always been here but a baby born in a stable laid in a Manger rejected of the world took that sting of death and has given victory over it that little baby that was wrapped in swaddling cloth now is revealed before the world I'm savior I'm healer I'm deliverer I'm peace I'm Joy I'm love I'm longsuffering I'm gentleness I'm kindness I'm everything that I want you to be look unto me I'm the greatest gift hardship in a Time of Happiness there's a story I read about a family who had lost their seven-year-old son Doug I don't know who this is for but it just I just could I just couldn't get away from it and they experienced all the Dynamics of grief they went through everything all the different stages of grief they went to listening to counselors they went to to experts they were trying to do everything exactly like it was supposed to be done until they felt and they felt like they were doing really good until they begin to deal with the grief when they put up their Christmas tree it was time to put up the Christmas tree and the family all gathered around and they began to go through and they begin to hang the ornaments up and the mother begins to remember some of the ornaments that was made by her son who is now gone and as a parent we've all got them right you got the little handprints on construction paper they make the manger you got the little turkeys from Thanksgiving you do them in Sunday school you do them in class you got all these things you begin to look and you begin to to go through these memories and some of them we cherish and you think man those are so silly my sister-in-law gave her mother one that says you're my best mom I don't have to tell you which one that was she Tow on herself and it hangs on my mother-in-law's refrigerator my my best mom I said is there another one is is there one I don't know about but we all have those little things that we treasure and they're putting these ornaments up in the tears begin to flow down her face and her older son all the ripe age of 10 years old comes up to her and puts his arm around her he said Mom you you miss douge don't you and she answered yeah I miss him more than you'll ever know and he said 'well Mom Christmas is when we celebrate the birth of Jesus isn't it she said 'y yeah that's right it is and he says well Doug's gone to be with Jesus hasn't he and she says yeah that's right he's gone to be with Jesus and he says well then that must mean that douge is having more fun than we are Christians don't die douge is having more fun than they are we need more stories that encourage us you say well that hurts that hurts and no doubt it hurts it grips our hearts it makes us want to shed tears but that's the reality douge is having more fun than we are I'm going to try to lighten up just a little bit before we end today's service and I'll tell you this story there was a preacher and his family they started putting up their nativity scene in their front yard and so all of them are carrying out their figures of the nativity scene and they're bringing out all these different different little things of the Nativity they're bringing out Joseph and Mary and the manger and baby and angels and Shepherds and Barnyard animals you know the scene we've we've all seen the scene and they're bringing this scene out well here comes little Scott he comes out here and he's carrying one of his favorite toys and he's carrying out this F this this big S foot inflatable tyranosaurus Rex and he brings it out there and they say what are you gonna do with that he said I'm going to put it in the nativity scene and his dad the pastor now of the church says no no no no no no we can't do that you you can't do that because dinosaurs wasn't in this this scene right here we can't be putting T T-Rex in the scene of the manger he said Dad please please please please you know how it is please please please please please oh well okay so they put up the T-Rex they flate the T-Rex the big sft tall T-Rex and they they look back they step back and they look and as they see this T-Rex in the navity Nativity Scene It Dawns on them and they realized that this dinosaur was actually saying more than what they realized they begin to look at it and they said you know what this menacing character hovers over us threatening to Rob us of our joy our our peace and our cheer and here this big dinosaur is now hovering over the scene we can't allow the things of this world the enemy the old Dragon to come down and steal our joy and our love and our peace but Christmas Comes to remind us that it's more than a baby in a Manger but don't forget that baby's a whole lot stronger than that dinosaur hovering over your back musicians if you come I know this was a little different today probably like you've never heard Christmas before but I trust it was beneficial to somebody you know I can remember going through hard times and hardship and I can remember looking I can remember where I was sitting and I may have told this story but we were going to college at the time and I can remember looking at the person next to me and he was on the phone and he was smiling and I told myself something told me I should say that's the way I should put it I was just it come to me that even though he's smiling and he seems happy I really don't know what that man's going through we never know what somebody's going through we're going to probably try to sing Silent Night Sister Sister Becky if you just want to play that I'm going to read you this one last quote it says and she looked at him talking about Mary says Joseph have you noticed the star hanging Yonder and when he looked and S the surprise he said I hadn't noticed it before dear said well it's been flowing it's been following us ever since the sun went down and I've watched it it must mean something because I have the most wonderful feeling I have the most wonderful feeling and Joseph said Mary you know what I've never been so happy in all my life that's the spirit of Christmas he said way into the East and many hundreds of miles away from there the Magi were already on the road they had seen his star they was coming to worship God God's little gift package that he was sending to the world he said but just a little while from then the world was going to receive its greatest gift that it had ever received a little package wrapped up a little the first little Christmas package that was ever wrapped in all the world and he said God wrapped it up and I want to break in on my thought and say this he says the greatest thing was ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in that God himself wrapped his own self in the Christmas package and sent it to the world aren't you thankful for the Christmas package let's stand to our feet can you bring those words up Carson I I was looking at this song and you know I I thought about this song and I was trying to decide what to sing and this is kind of the iconic Christmas song Silent Night and and it talks about a calm and a bright Silent Night a a a Wonder of tender and a a child a newborn child but do you know this the background of this story it was written right after the Napoleonic Wars the world was in destruction the the land was in destruction and a and a man goes out and he begins to look around and after the war he hit such inspiration hit him because he could see the town was at peace this song has been translated into 300 languages this song has been recorded 137,000 different recordings silent night it's sung in churches and town squares this is the song that was sung on the battlefield in World War II uh World War I in 1914 when they declared it a night of peace one night during the war all the soldiers declared one night of peace no shooting no bombing no fussing no feuding Christmas Eve Christmas Eve of 1914 December the 24th was a true Silent Night of the war they all came together they walked across Enemy Lines they fellowshipped they talked they had dinner these are talking about people that are willing to kill each other the next day or the day before but they said one night we're going
