[40:12] brother Thomas and I were talking just
[40:15] you know meditating over the friendship
[40:16] that we've kind of formed the last
[40:18] couple days and you know it's just great
[40:20] to be able to to visit with people and
[40:23] have something in common not just you
[40:25] know not just things that we en Joy like
[40:27] hunting and and things of that nature
[40:29] but also this message and you know
[40:32] recognizes his love for the message and
[40:33] his love for the people and we're so
[40:36] thankful for that and you should be
[40:38] thankful as well that you have a pastor
[40:39] that that loves you and he loves this
[40:41] message and you say well he should know
[40:43] everything well you know what we're
[40:45] human so you know when that time comes
[40:47] God's going to give us what we have need
[40:49] of in that season of life but until that
[40:51] time we should just get behind the gift
[40:53] and let's continue to pray for your
[40:55] pastor pray for your ministry team here
[40:57] brother Brad as well and just pray that
[41:00] God will feed them what they have need
[41:02] of so they can in turn feed you what you
[41:04] have need of and you know that's how
[41:06] we're going to get out of here honestly
[41:08] it's no big eyes or little 's it's all
[41:10] of us pushing putting our shoulder
[41:12] together for the purpose that God can be
[41:13] glorified and so tonight I just want to
[41:16] take a little bit of time and I want to
[41:17] speak to you on he will finish it now we
[41:20] understand in the scripture the Bible
[41:22] does already tell us that when he bowed
[41:24] his head and died he said it is finished
[41:25] we already understand it's a finished
[41:28] work but you how many of you are human
[41:30] tonight all right good so you're human
[41:32] and there's a lot of times when we're
[41:33] facing difficulties in life we're going
[41:36] through hardships and we're going
[41:37] through trials sometimes we ask oursel
[41:40] when will he finish
[41:42] this have you ever just asked that
[41:45] question when will this be over I want
[41:47] to encourage you tonight he will finish
[41:51] it and we find here in Philippians 1
[41:54] verse6 being confident of this very
[41:58] thing that he which begun a good work in
[42:01] you will perform it until the day of
[42:04] Jesus Christ God bless you you can have
[42:07] your seats also look here in Hebrews 12
[42:10] and verse
[42:11] two Hebrews 12 and verse two says
[42:14] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[42:18] finisher of our faith so he's not only
[42:21] the beginner of our faith he's also the
[42:24] finisher of our faith so what we're
[42:26] looking at tonight is that he will
[42:29] finish what he started so this word
[42:32] finisher here means completer perfector
[42:36] so there's a lot of times we get up in
[42:38] the morning we look in the mirror and
[42:40] you know what you you get older you get
[42:42] more wrinkles you get older you need B
[42:45] gay you need some kind of rubbing
[42:46] element ointment on your body because
[42:49] you know what pain starts setting in
[42:51] joints start setting you know
[42:53] inflammation there but we find no matter
[42:55] what we go through on this side out of
[42:57] Eternity we got a promise that he's the
[43:00] finisher and though we may not look
[43:02] perfect we may not feel perfect we have
[43:05] a perfect god with a perfect word and
[43:07] that perfect God and a perfect word is
[43:10] going to perfect the people and he's
[43:12] already put it out there and there ain't
[43:14] a devil in hell can stop that word from
[43:17] completion so I'm here to encourage you
[43:20] no matter what you're going through no
[43:21] matter the situation you're in tonight
[43:23] or the weed that you face God will
[43:26] perform perform that work he will
[43:29] complete that work he will finish what
[43:32] he started because he is God and God's
[43:35] got a purpose and God's got a plan and
[43:37] God's got you in his thoughts and God
[43:40] will not throw you away he will not lose
[43:42] you he will not forsake you God
[43:45] understands your situation and he will
[43:48] finish that which he begun in your life
[43:51] I just believe that you know we're human
[43:54] we Face hardships and we gone through
[43:56] hard times but we have to look at the
[43:58] word of God and and be like David David
[44:00] encouraged himself in the Lord and
[44:03] sometimes we need to just stop stop uh
[44:06] praising our trials stop praising our
[44:09] situation stop giving those things life
[44:12] and look to the word of God look to the
[44:14] promises of God and encourage yourself
[44:17] in the word that you're no longer out in
[44:19] the world doing the things that ungodly
[44:21] people are doing but God has called you
[44:23] to a message God has called you to a
[44:25] holy life God has f you with the Holy
[44:28] Ghost God will save your children God
[44:30] will heal your body all these things
[44:32] God's promised in his word and if God
[44:35] promised it he will finish
[44:39] it do you believe that so we find Paul
[44:43] here is affirming to us that that which
[44:45] he started he will
[44:48] finish and he's declaring that man has
[44:51] nothing to do with this you know you
[44:54] meet some people they want to take all
[44:56] the credit that's
[44:58] right I can't stand that kind of person
[45:02] I'm sorry any know they want to take
[45:05] everybody's credit they want to take
[45:07] they can't they can't afford for anybody
[45:09] else to get any kind of credit but Paul
[45:11] is telling you here and he's telling us
[45:13] man has nothing to do with this this is
[45:17] not a work that man started therefore
[45:20] it's not a work that man's going to be
[45:22] able to finish this is the work that God
[45:25] started and if God started it hell or
[45:27] high water God will finish it no matter
[45:31] how bad Satan he get God has already
[45:34] said that he will have a bride and she
[45:37] will be without spot and she will be
[45:40] without blemish and she will be perfect
[45:44] you think he's going to come take some
[45:45] imperfect bride no sir look I picked the
[45:49] best woman in the
[45:51] world in my eyes that's right she's
[45:54] perfect for
[45:55] me and God's picked the perfect one for
[45:59] him so we find here notice in John
[46:04] 1:12 but as many as received him to them
[46:08] gave he the power to become sons of God
[46:12] I didn't see in that scripture that man
[46:13] had anything to do with that at
[46:16] all to many as received him to them gave
[46:20] he the he gave them the power to become
[46:23] sons of God even to them that believed
[46:25] on his name which were born not of blood
[46:29] nor of the will of Flesh otherwise nor
[46:31] of the will of man but of God oh
[46:36] Hallelujah so God is taking man he's
[46:39] taking you Humanity he's taking your
[46:41] failures he's taking your mistakes he's
[46:43] taking all that out of the equation
[46:46] tonight and God says I did it I started
[46:49] it and I'm going to finish it he's going
[46:51] to look beyond your failures he's going
[46:53] to look beyond your mistakes he's going
[46:55] to look Beyond those valleys that you go
[46:57] through and God said I'm going to bring
[46:59] my bride to a perfect
[47:02] end notice in the message possessing all
[47:05] things brother man would tell us I'm an
[47:07] heir of all things and we touched on a
[47:09] lot of that this past Sunday but and so
[47:12] some of these thoughts that you here
[47:13] today is be because when a man studies
[47:16] everything just gets poured into it you
[47:17] know he just he's on a train of thought
[47:19] and so this has kind of been the train
[47:21] of thought I've had for the last several
[47:22] months but he says I'm an air of all
[47:24] things amen it's given to me I'm an air
[47:28] I can claim everything that God promised
[47:32] me there you are it's mine how do you
[47:34] get it something You' done no sir it's
[47:38] unmar gift that God gave us and it's
[47:40] ours it belongs to us so it's
[47:44] unmar so man has nothing to do with this
[47:48] at all therefore Paul says we can be
[47:53] confident otherwise you can be persuaded
[47:58] you can be confident of this very thing
[48:00] tonight that he almighty God Elohim
[48:05] Jehovah I mean the the almighty the one
[48:08] who formed and fashioned our bodies the
[48:10] one who knew we would be here in what
[48:11] age to put us in he that began this work
[48:14] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[48:19] Christ
[48:20] notice this is a work that God started
[48:23] God thought of you and God desired to
[48:25] have fellowship with you so much so that
[48:28] he knew which age to bring you
[48:31] in thank God he didn't bring me in the
[48:34] horse and buggy
[48:36] age I like my
[48:38] truck I mean we get down the road pretty
[48:41] quick I don't passing these Amish and
[48:44] you know hey I praise God I'm not in
[48:46] that day somebody should say Amen a
[48:48] little bit louter than what you just did
[48:51] God's made way but we find see God
[48:53] desired in the beginning God desired to
[48:55] have fellowship with
[48:57] you I know sometimes that's hard to
[48:59] believe huh cuz you see your failures
[49:02] you see your mistakes you see your
[49:04] Humanity but God sees his
[49:07] promise see God sees the thoughts that
[49:10] he's poured into that and we find here
[49:12] God knew which age to bring you into he
[49:15] knew what family to to allow you to be
[49:17] born into he watched over your
[49:20] seed just take for instance there's
[49:23] going to be a child born here the 17th
[49:25] of May
[49:29] Joshua and Ayah this dude's all the way
[49:32] up from Washington Canada somewhere but
[49:36] God knew that there was a seed that
[49:37] needed to come to fruition that was
[49:40] already predestinated before the
[49:41] foundation of the world and how in the
[49:44] world Joshua Rivas scored a Leah is
[49:48] beyond he out kicked his coverage
[49:50] tonight but God already was watching
[49:52] over the sea they got to put this one
[49:54] with that one to make this one come the
[49:56] life cuz I got that seed predestinated
[49:59] for a certain age for a certain time and
[50:02] that's what God is here tonight and if
[50:03] God could say that and do that don't you
[50:06] think God's able to finish it for you
[50:07] and I tonight and even in our own homes
[50:10] and our own families with her own
[50:12] children he's watched over that
[50:14] seed and he knew where to put that seed
[50:17] he knew what church to put that seed
[50:20] into he knew what family to put it into
[50:23] he knew the right atmosphere and if he
[50:26] knows all that won't he finish what he
[50:29] started I'm so thankful that God's not
[50:31] depending on me to finish his
[50:35] work so he that began the work will
[50:38] finish the work and some you know it may
[50:41] take
[50:42] days it may take weeks months years but
[50:45] God will complete it remember the
[50:46] prophet of God said that a Son of God
[50:48] can go a long time before he ever
[50:50] recognizes that he's a
[50:52] son but inside of that son though he
[50:56] doesn't recognize it God put a deposit
[50:59] in
[51:00] there and no matter how much the devil
[51:02] tries to cover it up tries to smear it
[51:05] out try to ruin his name try to maybe
[51:07] tat him up and do whatever else ruin his
[51:10] life with alcohol and drugs no matter
[51:12] what there's a sea laying inside of that
[51:15] life you know I just think about you
[51:17] know how brother B would talk about
[51:19] different ones like Rosella Griffin who
[51:21] was an alcoholic and she cut the insides
[51:23] of her jacket out and stuffed bottles of
[51:25] whiskey in there cuz she was that bad
[51:27] off Satan thought he had that seed Satan
[51:30] thought he' had done it he' got her to
[51:32] ruin her life was in shambles she lived
[51:34] on a street and she was a alcoholic and
[51:36] controlled and dictated her life but in
[51:39] one moment in the presence of God in one
[51:41] service God came down and he still God
[51:44] tonight he can come down on a Tuesday
[51:46] night it may not be a Wednesday night it
[51:49] may not be a normal servant but he's
[51:51] still God and you're still his people
[51:53] tonight and he still got obligation to
[51:55] you
[51:57] God is obligated to his word and if the
[52:00] word of God is living on the inside of
[52:01] you then God is obligated to you
[52:04] tonight he's obligated to finish what he
[52:09] started so when did this work begin
[52:11] brother
[52:13] Joe brother B would tell us in the
[52:15] message Easter seal if you hadn't
[52:17] listened to that in a while I encourage
[52:19] you to go back and listen to it he says
[52:21] and then when we being the his children
[52:23] are part of him that is the attributes
[52:25] of his thing thinking notice we're
[52:28] attributes of his
[52:29] thinking and the thought is expressed
[52:32] and becomes
[52:51] word God's
[52:54] thinking now I love that that then each
[52:57] individual here that possesses this
[53:00] eternal life was before the foundational
[53:02] World in God's sinking it's the only way
[53:04] it could be cuz you're an attribute
[53:07] that's an expression of a thought see
[53:09] has become a word and the word has taken
[53:12] life and it's Eternal that's the reason
[53:14] we have eternal life we become Sons and
[53:17] Daughters of God through the Same Spirit
[53:19] by the same for knowledge of God so God
[53:23] fornew us and we're going to get into
[53:26] just a little bit and I I wish I I wish
[53:28] I had a little bit more time a few more
[53:30] weeks I got a several thoughts I would
[53:32] love to preach to you on the word would
[53:33] bring forth because you know man you
[53:35] just start studying down a little series
[53:37] and that thing just grows and grows and
[53:39] grows and grows and it's been one of the
[53:41] greatest studies that I've done but we
[53:43] find when God started in Genesis or when
[53:46] he stated in Genesis that he will he
[53:49] will have a church he will have a man he
[53:51] would have a bride of people he said let
[53:53] us make man in our own image God was
[53:56] placing it out there no matter what the
[53:58] age was what how bad the age was how bad
[54:01] it would get no matter what he was going
[54:03] to have somebody that was going to fit
[54:06] his
[54:07] image and so we find what God started in
[54:10] Genesis he's going to finish in theay to
[54:12] see an age so the thoughts that he had
[54:15] in the beginning will culminate in an
[54:17] end time people in an end time
[54:20] Bride come on
[54:22] bride see the church that he established
[54:25] on the day of pente cost will be the
[54:27] same church that he raptures in our
[54:30] day you say what do you mean brother I'm
[54:33] saying she's going to have the same
[54:34] power she's going to have the same
[54:36] anointing she's going to have the same
[54:37] Spirit what she did there she's going to
[54:40] do here we're not going to put the gifts
[54:42] on the shelf and say we don't need them
[54:44] anymore because we got the revealed word
[54:46] because we got the revealed word those
[54:49] gifts are going to be in operation in
[54:51] the local
[54:53] body so here we find he's the amen of
[54:56] God do you believe
[54:57] that otherwise he's just so be it the
[55:00] final say there's nothing left for
[55:04] discussion God's already put a
[55:05] declaration out there it will be what he
[55:08] says it will be therefore he will finish
[55:10] what he said that he will do so no
[55:12] matter what comes against the word no
[55:14] matter how many Devils rage war against
[55:16] it to try to stop it God's already
[55:18] spoken it and he will see it till its
[55:22] completion he will finish the work
[55:27] so in Genesis 1 and verse 26 you could
[55:30] go there with me if you don't mind and
[55:32] we find here this is where God is
[55:34] setting the if you would say the cogs
[55:38] into
[55:40] motion all the way back in Genesis but
[55:42] it actually goes further than
[55:45] this and God said let us make man in our
[55:48] image after our likeness and let them
[55:50] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[55:53] and over the fowl of the air and over
[55:54] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[55:56] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[55:57] the Earth so God created Man In His
[56:00] Image in the image of God created he him
[56:03] male and female created he them so we
[56:06] find in Genesis what was God doing God
[56:09] was expressing his desire to have a
[56:12] family see before at one one point he
[56:16] was he wasn't even God he was uh the
[56:20] self-existing one therefore he made
[56:23] angels and Angels worshiped him and then
[56:25] he became God but those angels were
[56:28] created to worship him they couldn't do
[56:31] anything else but God had a desire to
[56:33] make Man In His Image and he put man on
[56:36] free moral agency so that that man will
[56:39] love him unconditionally that man would
[56:41] make a choice he would love God and
[56:43] serve God or he wouldn't love God or he
[56:45] wouldn't serve God so he was expressing
[56:49] his desire to have a family his desire
[56:51] to have a bride and God had thoughts of
[56:53] you thoughts of you being part of that
[56:55] family
[56:58] yeah I know sometimes you wish you
[57:00] wasn't born in the family you were born
[57:02] into
[57:03] right you know they say you can choose
[57:05] your friends you can't choose your
[57:07] family but this is not what we're
[57:10] thinking see God chose you put you in
[57:14] his family before you were ever born
[57:17] before you breathed your first breath
[57:18] before you ever had your first trial
[57:20] sickness heartache maybe before your
[57:22] first sin God had you in his thoughts
[57:28] think about job for a minute we look
[57:30] here and we find job job lost his wealth
[57:33] job lost his children Joe's wife turned
[57:36] against him my you know how that is
[57:39] Brothers No you don't hopefully
[57:41] not but you know I mean that one that's
[57:43] supposed to love you like nobody else
[57:45] turns against you won't you just Curse
[57:47] God and die job and job got down on
[57:49] himself he got he cursed the day that he
[57:51] was born but he never cursed God and we
[57:53] look here in job
[57:54] 38:4 God speaking he comes down because
[57:57] he's mindful of job same way he's
[58:00] mindful of you the same way he spoke to
[58:02] some of you this past Sunday we find
[58:04] here God begins to speak to job job
[58:07] where was thou when I laid the
[58:09] foundations of the
[58:11] earth declare if thou Hast the
[58:14] understanding then we look down in verse
[58:16] seven and he begins to say when the
[58:18] morning Stars sang together and all the
[58:21] sons of God shouted for Joy not just
[58:24] during that time but all all the sons of
[58:27] God even down into the L DEC and age
[58:30] when they were shouting job God was
[58:32] reminding job he was telling Joe Jo
[58:35] before you ever lost your children
[58:36] before you ever lost your wealth before
[58:38] you ever got sick in your body before
[58:40] your wife ever turned against you job
[58:43] where were you at job you was in my
[58:45] thinking before I laid the foundations
[58:48] of the world and I saw you shouting I
[58:50] saw you praising God I saw you
[58:53] worshiping God did not see job in defeat
[58:56] he saw job in
[58:59] Victory and what am I telling you you're
[59:02] in the very thoughts of God tonight God
[59:04] doesn't see you in defeat God sees you
[59:06] in Victory God sees you Rising above
[59:09] that situation shouting and worshiping
[59:12] and praising
[59:15] God that's the way I want him to see me
[59:18] and how can he see you that way because
[59:20] you were in his
[59:22] thinking you want to talk about an
[59:24] overcomer you can't help but
[59:28] overcome come on Church you're a Victor
[59:30] you're the
[59:32] winner see God didn't see job as a fail
[59:36] believer but he saw job
[59:39] worshiping he knew that one day job was
[59:41] going to see and joob was going to speak
[59:44] out I know my redeemer liveth and though
[59:48] the skin worms destroy this Humanity of
[59:50] mine though it destroys My Flesh I'm
[59:53] going to see him my eyes are going to
[59:55] Behold Him him they're going to behold
[59:57] my
[59:58] Creator oh I love
[1:00:01] that see God had confidence in what he
[1:00:05] placed in job's
[1:00:07] life he had confidence in the seed that
[1:00:10] he placed in job's life and he knew that
[1:00:13] job was going to outlast a test and what
[1:00:17] am I telling you this morning that God
[1:00:18] has confidence in the seed that he
[1:00:21] placed in your life this evening he's
[1:00:23] got confidence in you this evening if
[1:00:26] you could just have confidence that
[1:00:27] he'll finish what he
[1:00:29] started so notice we find here in 2
[1:00:32] Thessalonians 2 and: 13 we were chosen
[1:00:35] from the beginning the Bible tells us
[1:00:37] but we are bound to give thanks always
[1:00:39] to God for you Brethren beloved of the
[1:00:41] Lord because God had chosen from the
[1:00:44] beginning or God has chosen from the
[1:00:46] beginning you to Salvation through
[1:00:48] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[1:00:50] of the truth where unto he called you by
[1:00:53] Our Gospel so we were chosen from the
[1:00:56] beginning the beginning is not when you
[1:00:58] were born the beginning wasn't when you
[1:01:00] came to the Earth the beginning wasn't
[1:01:01] when you came to the Altar and accepted
[1:01:03] him as a savior the beginning wasn't
[1:01:05] when you accepted the message of the
[1:01:06] hour when you was in the beginning that
[1:01:09] was when you were in the thoughts of God
[1:01:11] and God chose you right there to be a
[1:01:14] son to be a daughter of God to live in
[1:01:17] Elon Kentucky to overcome and L of sin
[1:01:20] to withstand every test that the enemy
[1:01:22] can put upon you he chose you for this
[1:01:24] hour
[1:01:28] but for your natural birth God called
[1:01:31] you and chose you and placed you here
[1:01:34] man I love
[1:01:35] that God has so much confidence in that
[1:01:38] that it means I'm going to
[1:01:41] overcome notice now where did he choose
[1:01:44] us let's go to Ephesians tonight
[1:01:46] Ephesians 1 and
[1:01:48] verse4 the Bible
[1:01:50] says according as he had chosen us in in
[1:01:59] him oh that's just
[1:02:03] beautiful according as he had chosen Us
[1:02:07] in him before the foundation of the
[1:02:10] world there we go back to the
[1:02:12] beginning that we should be holy there
[1:02:15] it is church come on that we should be
[1:02:17] without blame before him and love having
[1:02:20] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:02:22] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:02:24] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:02:26] will let's go to verse 7 in whom we have
[1:02:28] Redemption through his blood forgiveness
[1:02:30] of sins according to the riches of his
[1:02:32] grace wherein Heath abounded toward us
[1:02:35] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[1:02:37] known unto us the mystery of his
[1:02:42] will according to his good pleasure
[1:02:45] which he had purposed in himself so we
[1:02:48] were chosen in the beginning then he
[1:02:50] comes and tells us in the Ephesians that
[1:02:53] the beginning was in him in Christ
[1:02:57] oh
[1:02:58] my you can't lose little
[1:03:01] bride how can you lose don't get down on

[1:03:21] us he ain't gonna let you know one
[1:03:23] minute choose you next minute he throws

[1:03:31] victorious man didn't choose you the
[1:03:34] church didn't choose you the prophet
[1:03:35] didn't choose you the bishop didn't
[1:03:37] choose you I don't care who it is none
[1:03:39] of them chose you God chose you and when
[1:03:41] did he do it before the foundation you
[1:03:44] know that in one place brother Brown
[1:03:45] said that he created the the beaches and
[1:03:47] he created the oceans and he created the
[1:03:49] mountains because he knew that there
[1:03:50] would be a desire in some of you that
[1:03:52] like mountains and so he created
[1:03:54] mountains cuz you would have that desire
[1:03:56] because you would like that so God knew
[1:03:58] your thoughts what you would like
[1:04:00] therefore when he created the
[1:04:01] foundations of the world he created it
[1:04:04] with you in mind what a God we serve
[1:04:08] tonight God is so mindful of us I can't
[1:04:11] stand a
[1:04:13] beach I mean you get sand in places you
[1:04:15] didn't even know you had and you digging
[1:04:18] that sand out three four five weeks
[1:04:20] later but you can go to a mountain top
[1:04:24] man it's so beautiful and Breezy and
[1:04:27] cool and you ain't getting sand on the
[1:04:29] mountain top if you are you in the wrong
[1:04:32] Mountain but see some of you like
[1:04:35] beaches some of you ladies I don't know
[1:04:36] why but you
[1:04:38] do guys if you like a beach well I'm
[1:04:41] sorry but God knew what you would like
[1:04:45] therefore he formed it and fashioned
[1:04:48] it so notice we were in his thinking and
[1:04:51] he called us and predestinated US unto
[1:04:54] the adoption the place ing as a
[1:04:58] son some of us were without in the world
[1:05:00] without any hope dead in sin and
[1:05:03] trespasses but yet there was a seed that
[1:05:05] God deposited before the foundation of
[1:05:07] the world and one day you had to hear
[1:05:10] that eagle Scream one day you had to
[1:05:13] hear from your theophany because that
[1:05:15] word was already placed inside of you
[1:05:19] because you were a thought of God and
[1:05:21] every thought of God shall be manifested
[1:05:24] in its time
[1:05:26] in the age in which God desired it to be
[1:05:29] so notice listen what brother Brown says
[1:05:31] in the church age he said heing Is Now
[1:05:32] set forth the love of God he desired in
[1:05:35] love a family of his
[1:05:40] own a family of Sons Sons like
[1:05:44] him there before him lies all mankind as
[1:05:47] one lump of clay and out of that same
[1:05:49] lump he will now make vessels unto honor
[1:05:51] and unto dishonor but he says the
[1:05:53] choosing will be his own choosing then
[1:05:56] those chosen ones born of a spirit will
[1:05:59] be trained to conform Into His Image in
[1:06:01] their walk then we go into Christ to
[1:06:03] mystery of God revealed and he preaches
[1:06:06] Christ to mystery just after opening the
[1:06:08] Seven Seals and so we find here now the
[1:06:12] book is no longer a closed book now the
[1:06:14] book is an open book so the
[1:06:16] understanding begins to be illuminated
[1:06:18] like a Roman Candle Revelation upon
[1:06:20] Revelation begins to unfold and now he
[1:06:23] can see what the whole purpose and plan
[1:06:25] of God is and he says back in the back
[1:06:27] part of God's mind there was something
[1:06:29] that God was trying and was going to
[1:06:32] achieve and he had a motive in doing it
[1:06:34] in order to let himself be
[1:06:37] expressed so now he's going just beyond
[1:06:41] the foundations of the world now he's
[1:06:43] getting us into the back part of God's
[1:06:45] mind going back into the thinking of God
[1:06:48] and he says so in his great mind he
[1:06:51] wanted these attributes to be expressed
[1:06:54] and in him was love
[1:06:56] in him was to be a father in him was to
[1:06:58] be a son in him was to be a savior in
[1:07:01] him was to be a Healer all these great
[1:07:03] attributes that we see already expressed
[1:07:05] they were in
[1:07:08] God so God brother B says God had a
[1:07:11] purpose and a hidden
[1:07:15] Mystery and we can go into this and go
[1:07:17] into it but I'm not going to just dive
[1:07:19] off into it because I'm only going to
[1:07:20] preach just a little bit longer I'm not
[1:07:21] going to hold you too long tonight but
[1:07:23] we find here if you go and you look and
[1:07:26] you paragraph 457 brother B says Jesus
[1:07:29] showing that he himself God in him will
[1:07:31] be manifested in his bride in the last
[1:07:34] days so in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:07:37] revealed we find the purpose of God the
[1:07:39] plan of God God is wanting to manifest
[1:07:42] himself in a
[1:07:43] body never before no other age ever had
[1:07:47] him manifested in the body well we can
[1:07:51] say the Ephesian age right because we or
[1:07:53] yeah when the when he poured it out but
[1:07:54] we find that immediately they went into
[1:07:56] the Dark Ages just some 33 years after
[1:07:58] the establishment of the church they be
[1:08:00] to listen to Man versus the spirit and
[1:08:02] they went off into this to to the Dark
[1:08:04] Ages but we find it took a Malachi 4
[1:08:07] Ministry it took a revelation 10:7
[1:08:09] Ministry to do what to bring him back
[1:08:11] here again so that now he's no longer
[1:08:13] God above us now he's no longer God With
[1:08:16] Us now he's God in us and that's what
[1:08:19] God's desire has been the whole time
[1:08:21] that he can come and Tabernacle your
[1:08:24] Humanity so will be God coming in Bride
[1:08:27] form in this hour which is Christ The
[1:08:30] Mystery of God
[1:08:33] revealed so we find Christ the true
[1:08:35] headship going in coming in his bride
[1:08:38] doing the same works that he did at the
[1:08:40] beginning making ready the fulfilling of
[1:08:43] his word as he did at first John 14:12
[1:08:46] he says now the head and the body are
[1:08:48] becoming one in works and in sign and in
[1:08:51] life Vindicated by God himself through
[1:08:54] his promise word for the last days he
[1:08:57] promised this in the last days he says
[1:08:59] now if you're spiritual you'll catch
[1:09:04] it so the great mystery is his
[1:09:08] coming and we understand we're not
[1:09:10] talking about his physical
[1:09:13] coming because he will come he has three
[1:09:17] Corporal comings he comes we know he
[1:09:19] comes to redeem his bride he comes for
[1:09:21] his bride and he comes with his bride
[1:09:24] but now we find him in the lesty and age
[1:09:27] and if you go back and listen to
[1:09:28] Christ's mystery you find he's here
[1:09:31] again but he's not here in a Corporal
[1:09:34] body but the prophet would say he's here
[1:09:36] in every detail same power same
[1:09:40] anointing same Authority same in every
[1:09:43] detail except the Corporal body why
[1:09:46] because it's in this age that now he can
[1:09:48] come and Tabernacle your
[1:09:51] [Music]
[1:09:52] Humanity oh come on that should make a
[1:09:54] Baptist Shout
[1:09:56] tonight that should make you rejoice
[1:09:59] tonight it ain't about you it never was
[1:10:01] you to have to do this and work yourself
[1:10:04] up and be good enough and do hell
[1:10:06] marriage and do whatever it was all
[1:10:07] about God coming in this hour and taking
[1:10:10] control of your flesh and your Humanity
[1:10:14] God Almighty Tabernacle your
[1:10:18] humanity and it's always been a
[1:10:22] mystery see we find some people that are
[1:10:24] not spirit spiritual they look at the
[1:10:27] vessel like Ain't No Way in God's green
[1:10:30] earth does that man got he ain't
[1:10:33] God and then you got some that want to
[1:10:35] deify the man and they said there ain't
[1:10:37] no way he can be human he's nothing but
[1:10:40] God our preach Ms not too long ago we
[1:10:43] had the answer and that was the struggle
[1:10:46] that Satan had cuz he looked and he said
[1:10:48] this man is supposed to be God but yet
[1:10:52] brother Bram said he was 100% man
[1:10:56] but yet he was 100%
[1:10:58] God so there's the question how can you
[1:11:01] be God and yet be full man be 100% man
[1:11:05] and how can you be 100% man and yet be
[1:11:08] God oh I hope you get this and all that
[1:11:11] God was he poured it into Christ and all
[1:11:14] that Christ was he poured it into a
[1:11:16] bride so what am I telling you I'm
[1:11:18] telling you how can you be 100% God when
[1:11:21] you're man and how can you be man when
[1:11:24] you're 100% God we got the answer
[1:11:27] tonight to the devil's question that God
[1:11:29] came in this hour and it's no longer us
[1:11:32] but it's him coming through us that
[1:11:34] which he prophesied that which he
[1:11:36] declared he's finishing in the end time
[1:11:40] bride so the secret has always been
[1:11:43] about your
[1:11:47] coming the secret has always been about
[1:11:49] your
[1:11:50] coming that's why he kept it a
[1:11:53] secret he was coming and Bri right
[1:11:56] for cuz if he knew if the devil got a
[1:11:59] hold of that and I want you just to see
[1:12:01] this just for a minute the Bible tells
[1:12:03] us that there's there's a reward to
[1:12:04] those in one of the ages he's going to
[1:12:06] give a white stone to and in that white
[1:12:09] stone is going to give you a new name
[1:12:11] that no one knows but he that receives
[1:12:14] it see it's a personal
[1:12:17] revelation that you know that you know
[1:12:21] where you come
[1:12:22] from Brother Thomas is one of of a
[1:12:25] pastor and a minister that he is he
[1:12:27] can't give you that
[1:12:30] revelation God and God alone has to
[1:12:33] impart that Revelation to you that you
[1:12:36] come from my thoughts and what you are
[1:12:39] is not who you are but what you are is
[1:12:41] who I am through you so God is coming to
[1:12:44] work through a bride so that his word
[1:12:47] will be performed so that he will
[1:12:49] complete that which he's already
[1:12:51] declared let us make man in our image
[1:12:54] and if we're made in the image of God
[1:12:55] shouldn't we do Godly things shouldn't
[1:12:58] we have the supernatural signs and
[1:13:00] wonders following our ministry shouldn't
[1:13:02] we be able to speak in tongues and do
[1:13:04] other things of that nature and see God
[1:13:06] manifest in this hour but we done got so
[1:13:09] spiritual that we put those things back
[1:13:11] on the shf and we don't want anything to
[1:13:12] do with them I'm tell you it's time to
[1:13:14] take them off the shf and let the Holy
[1:13:16] Ghost holy ghost in our church let the
[1:13:18] Holy Ghost move in our lives let them
[1:13:20] move in our homes let them move in our
[1:13:22] children let the Holy Ghost do what he
[1:13:24] declares he will do he will finish this
[1:13:27] work if we allow him to finish
[1:13:31] it and Satan fight you so hard he
[1:13:34] attacks with fear and depression anxiety
[1:13:36] and complexity cuz he doesn't want you
[1:13:39] to know the revelation of who you
[1:13:42] are he doesn't want you to get that
[1:13:45] Revelation he's doing everything he can
[1:13:47] to keep it a mystery to you but he that
[1:13:50] gets a white stone gets a new name do
[1:13:53] you know that the Overcomer of every age
[1:13:55] that the leot to see an overcomer gets
[1:13:57] the gets the reward from all the
[1:13:59] previous
[1:14:01] ages you get a new name you get to sit
[1:14:04] with him in his throne that means we're
[1:14:06] going to rule and Reign
[1:14:08] Church you ain't going to be sitting on
[1:14:09] the tractor raining we're going to be
[1:14:11] sitting in a throne riging that Throne
[1:14:13] is a domain that's right oh my some of
[1:14:16] you been looking for a domain for a long
[1:14:18] time well I'm telling you it's coming
[1:14:20] God's got one pre-planned for you I'll
[1:14:23] tell you what you're going to sit there
[1:14:24] you're going to rule and rain with him
[1:14:26] it's going to be a glorious time in the
[1:14:28] Millennium Church we're going to be
[1:14:29] sitting down at the wedding supper of
[1:14:31] the Lamb there ain't going to be a plate
[1:14:33] missing there ain't going to be an extra
[1:14:34] plate there God knows your name is there
[1:14:36] God knows when he put you there and
[1:14:38] God's is obligated to it tonight I'm
[1:14:40] telling you we got a right to to thank
[1:14:42] God for what he's going to do for us
[1:14:45] what he's doing in our lives it's been a
[1:14:46] mystery but it's no longer a mystery
[1:14:48] anymore we see Christ in his body we see
[1:14:52] Christ manifested in the bride
[1:14:56] but Satan doesn't want you to have this
[1:14:59] Revelation I'm just going to go through
[1:15:01] some quotes here just to affirm reaffirm
[1:15:05] the word is falling apart all that God
[1:15:07] was he poured into Christ and all that
[1:15:10] Christ was he poured into the
[1:15:12] church at that day you should know that
[1:15:14] I'm in the Father the father and me I in
[1:15:16] you and you in me so it's been God all
[1:15:20] along you see his same works the church
[1:15:23] is ordained to carry on his works with
[1:15:25] the same Spirit you couldn't carry on
[1:15:27] the same work without the Same Spirit
[1:15:29] That's right The Same Spirit Carries On
[1:15:32] the work then he says in the super sign
[1:15:34] oh God if the world could only see that
[1:15:37] that God and man are
[1:15:40] one the super sign was first man he said
[1:15:44] the super sign was first was that first
[1:15:46] man that God could come in into all that
[1:15:50] God was he poured into Christ and all
[1:15:51] that Christ was he pours into the church
[1:15:54] the super super sign God and man
[1:15:57] together that was to be the Super sign
[1:15:59] of the last day when the entire Bible
[1:16:01] was to be revealed or fulfilled in the
[1:16:04] last days where is it going to be
[1:16:07] fulfilled in the
[1:16:11] bride let's keep on going now then he
[1:16:13] says but the church has got a super sign
[1:16:15] God back in the church manifested in
[1:16:18] flesh God United with man his sure super
[1:16:23] sign then in ver verse 1112 he says
[1:16:25] notice the Eternal sign an unfailing
[1:16:28] sign it will never fail the word and man
[1:16:31] become one when God's word and man's
[1:16:34] become one in St John the first chapter
[1:16:37] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:16:39] was with God and the Word was made God
[1:16:41] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:16:43] Among Us that's the super sign and if
[1:16:46] that was the Super sign of that day when
[1:16:48] the same spirit that was on Jesus Christ
[1:16:50] comes into his church to manifest the
[1:16:53] written word for today it is still a
[1:16:55] super
[1:16:57] sign don't you realize you're a super
[1:17:01] people you know when I was a kid me and
[1:17:03] my brother we we love
[1:17:05] cartoons I was
[1:17:08] Superman you ever seen a little fat
[1:17:10] Stumpy Superman well I'd wrap a a
[1:17:14] pillowcase around my neck and jump off
[1:17:16] the jump off the dresser woo I thought I
[1:17:19] was somebody I let him be Batman or
[1:17:22] Robin one of them little weaker cartoon
[1:17:24] characters
[1:17:25] see I always I didn't know God put that
[1:17:27] super sign in me that desire to be
[1:17:29] something but God has placed it in we
[1:17:32] because his spirit is now tabernacling
[1:17:34] our Humanity now we are the super sign
[1:17:38] of the last days nobody will ever see
[1:17:41] Christ outside of the life that you live
[1:17:44] tonight CU nobody else can manifest
[1:17:47] Christ but his
[1:17:50] bride notice he says in Christ The
[1:17:52] Mystery of God he said he has showed or
[1:17:53] revealed in every typed that's in the
[1:17:55] Bible therefore the entire Bible is a
[1:17:57] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[1:18:00] the entire Bible is an expression of one
[1:18:03] goal that God had one purpose that he
[1:18:05] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[1:18:07] and all the acts of all the other
[1:18:09] believers in the Bible has been in type
[1:18:11] and expressing what God's Great goal is
[1:18:14] and now in this last day he has revealed
[1:18:17] it and shows it so let's just look at
[1:18:21] some of these Abraham and
[1:18:23] Sarah God in
[1:18:25] showing he's going to take a bride and
[1:18:27] he's going to turn her back young again
[1:18:30] so that she can bring forth the
[1:18:31] manifested words we look in Boaz and
[1:18:34] Ruth what was he doing here Boaz took a
[1:18:37] moabit to be a wife it's God declaring
[1:18:39] he's going to have a gentile bride we
[1:18:41] got salmon and Rahab we got Joseph
[1:18:43] before he revealed himself to his
[1:18:45] brothers he sent his Gentile bride back
[1:18:47] into the
[1:18:48] chamber everything has always been about
[1:18:51] him and a bride him and a bride him and
[1:18:54] a bride it's always about him and a
[1:18:56] bride you are the very heart desire of
[1:19:00] God
[1:19:02] tonight so everywhere in the scriptures
[1:19:04] it's always been about that how many of
[1:19:06] you here are married Brothers come on
[1:19:09] John raise your hand High you you're
[1:19:10] married there you go you know how it is
[1:19:14] you got a beautiful wife you love her
[1:19:16] you tell her things that you don't tell
[1:19:17] nobody
[1:19:19] else come on brother you can say Amen to
[1:19:21] that it's okay I'll say Amen to it amen
[1:19:25] I tell my wife things I don't tell
[1:19:26] nobody
[1:19:28] else and you love her and you bring her
[1:19:30] close to you and you just begin to talk
[1:19:32] to her she knows your hurts more than
[1:19:34] anybody she knows what makes you happy
[1:19:37] more than anybody she knows you better
[1:19:40] than anybody so what are you saying I'm
[1:19:42] saying that God so longs to have a bride
[1:19:45] that he can pull close to his side that
[1:19:47] he can whisper to her his Mysteries he
[1:19:50] can tell her his heart's desire and
[1:19:53] that's what he sent a message for cuz
[1:19:55] he's telling her who she is and how much
[1:19:58] she means to him she's he's telling her
[1:20:02] her place in the economy of
[1:20:06] God brother B would say you know he said
[1:20:09] this lady here used to be Miss Bry but
[1:20:12] now she's Miss brandom and he said and
[1:20:14] we will be Miss Jesus
[1:20:18] Christ so many people ask well what is
[1:20:21] my purpose brother Joe how many youve
[1:20:23] ever asked that question question a
[1:20:25] handful of you good let me tell you what
[1:20:27] your purpose is you were created to
[1:20:29] worship
[1:20:30] God you were created to praise His name
[1:20:34] you were created to love him you were
[1:20:36] created to reciprocate God's love toward
[1:20:38] you you can understand tonight that
[1:20:40] nobody can love God like you you know
[1:20:43] the Angels can't love God the way you
[1:20:45] can love
[1:20:48] him and furthermore no one can love you
[1:20:50] like
[1:20:52] him so nobody can love no no one can
[1:20:55] love God like the bride and no no one
[1:20:58] can love the bride like him it's a match
[1:21:00] that's made in
[1:21:01] heaven it's a union it's an invisible
[1:21:04] Union right now but one day Church he's
[1:21:09] coming because he said I'm going to
[1:21:11] finish this
[1:21:12] work there's going to be an overcomer in
[1:21:14] leod deia and she's going to sit right
[1:21:17] in my Throne she's going to rule and
[1:21:20] reign with me in my
[1:21:23] domain can I go just a little bit
[1:21:27] further he said when the Jews rejected
[1:21:30] it the Gentiles received it which was
[1:21:31] the type of the Bride he said he could
[1:21:34] he would call out a people of the
[1:21:35] Gentiles for his name's sake he said
[1:21:37] then then he goes this little girl back
[1:21:39] here she used to be a br but now she's a
[1:21:41] brandom she's my wife and the Bride of
[1:21:44] Jesus Christ will be Miss Jesus Christ
[1:21:47] Hallelujah baptized in his name in his
[1:21:50] name filled with his power robed in his
[1:21:52] righteousness Hallelujah there she is
[1:21:55] and now notice that was a gentile bride
[1:21:59] but Satan is doing everything he can to
[1:22:01] stop that marriage to keep that Union
[1:22:04] from happening to keep the bride from
[1:22:06] uniting with the groom and he's doing
[1:22:08] everything he can to get the bride to
[1:22:09] fall out of love with her groom he
[1:22:13] places vices in front of her he consumes
[1:22:15] her attention consumes her time tries to
[1:22:18] discredit God's word gets her to doubt
[1:22:20] tries to Blind her from the truth but I
[1:22:22] want you to know Satan doesn't have
[1:22:24] enough power tonight to stop what God
[1:22:26] has already set in
[1:22:29] motion so when God stated in the
[1:22:32] beginning that he's gonna have a bride
[1:22:35] then he's going to finish what he said
[1:22:38] you know God's not like you and I
[1:22:39] brother
[1:22:41] Tommy you know God don't start
[1:22:43] something to get bored with it and put
[1:22:47] it on the Shelf say well I'll get to it
[1:22:48] when I got
[1:22:49] time thank God he's not like that CU if
[1:22:53] that was the case look where we we
[1:22:55] be well I'll just get to Joe whenever I
[1:22:57] got
[1:22:59] time see God doesn't do that God will
[1:23:02] finish what he
[1:23:04] started I love
[1:23:06] it so we find here brother B tells us in
[1:23:10] the identified Christ of all ages he
[1:23:13] said but in in this great God Elohim was
[1:23:16] attributes there was attributes there to
[1:23:18] be to be God attributes to be a father
[1:23:20] attributes to be a son attributes to be
[1:23:22] a savior attributes to be a healer all
[1:23:25] these attributes was in God and if you
[1:23:28] ever got eternal life you were in God's
[1:23:32] attributes because you got eternal life
[1:23:35] Jesus came as a redeemer and to redeem
[1:23:38] means to bring it back to where it
[1:23:39] started right he says you were in God's
[1:23:43] thinking so sometimes we need to be
[1:23:46] reminded that we were in God's thinking
[1:23:50] especially when you're up against a
[1:23:51] trial up against a battle it's nice to
[1:23:53] be reminded on a midweek service where
[1:23:57] you came from and where you're going and
[1:24:00] we find in the church a l to see and age
[1:24:03] brother bam tells us and this to me is
[1:24:04] probably one of the most beautiful
[1:24:05] quotes he said his very existence is for
[1:24:09] his
[1:24:10] own he couldn't even be God without
[1:24:14] you the attributes to be a father
[1:24:17] attributes to be a Healer the attributes
[1:24:18] to be a savior he couldn't have those
[1:24:21] attributes without you don't you see
[1:24:24] your Place how important you are to
[1:24:29] God he said his very existence is for
[1:24:32] his own he loves them and cares for them
[1:24:35] His Eye Is ever upon
[1:24:37] them see and he tells us that he will
[1:24:40] lose none of us but raise us up in the
[1:24:43] last day he goes oh I'm so glad that I'm
[1:24:45] resting on his faithfulness we look in
[1:24:48] jermiah 29:1 it's a very familiar uh
[1:24:51] scripture for all of us
[1:24:54] and God is speaking here to Jeremiah and
[1:24:56] he saysi know the thoughts that I think
[1:24:58] toward you sayeth the
[1:25:00] Lord these are thoughts of peace and not
[1:25:02] of evil to give you an expected
[1:25:05] end so this word thought here means plan
[1:25:08] or purpose so God knows the purpose for
[1:25:10] each of our lives and the word peace
[1:25:13] here means
[1:25:16] completeness otherwise we can say
[1:25:20] finished so God has a thought a purpose
[1:25:23] to complete that which which he started
[1:25:25] in your life and the reward that he's
[1:25:27] going to give the end that he's here is
[1:25:30] the reward and we find in Revelations 3
[1:25:32] and verse 21 to him that overcometh will
[1:25:34] he Grant to sit with him in my in his
[1:25:36] throne so God is already saw the whole
[1:25:41] human race he's already saw every age
[1:25:44] and which bride will be in each age but
[1:25:46] there will be a final Bride of the final
[1:25:49] age and she receives a reward unlike any
[1:25:53] other age but because in this AG there's
[1:25:55] going to be one that won't taste of
[1:25:59] death but she's going to be changed in a
[1:26:01] moment in the twinkling of an
[1:26:04] eye and she's going to rule and reign
[1:26:06] with
[1:26:07] him and we find in Joel 2 vers2 says I
[1:26:11] will
[1:26:13] restore to you all the years that the
[1:26:16] Locust has eaten the cankerworm the
[1:26:18] caterpillar the polymer worm my great
[1:26:20] Army which I sent among you and ye shall
[1:26:23] eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[1:26:25] praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:26:28] that had dwelt wonderfully with you and
[1:26:30] my people shall never be ashamed and you
[1:26:33] should know that I am in the midst of
[1:26:35] Israel and I am the Lord your God and
[1:26:36] none else and my people shall never be
[1:26:39] ashamed that word restore here means to
[1:26:44] finish I will
[1:26:47] finish so we find the devil coming he
[1:26:49] came through four stages the Locust the
[1:26:51] caterpillar the cankerworm and what did
[1:26:53] he do he ate ate down the brid tree
[1:26:55] trying to destroy it but God had already
[1:26:58] prophesied and put it in writing put it
[1:27:00] in the pages of the Bible that I'm going
[1:27:02] to restore all that he had ate down so
[1:27:05] what is he saying it's a promise he's
[1:27:07] going to finish that brid tree she's
[1:27:09] going to come up in the last Age and
[1:27:11] what she was in the beginning she will
[1:27:14] be again in the end she won't be missing
[1:27:17] a lib she won't be missing a branch she
[1:27:19] won't be missing a fruit she won't be
[1:27:21] missing nothing she will be a perfect
[1:27:23] bride because he had sent a perfect word
[1:27:27] and if the word's not perfect then the
[1:27:28] bride can't be perfect and let me tell
[1:27:30] you and we've received everything we had
[1:27:33] need of through the message that we
[1:27:35] received why because it's a perfect
[1:27:38] message and it's making is producing A
[1:27:41] Perfect People by a perfect
[1:27:44] word and if it's not a perfect message
[1:27:47] then we we must have him to come again
[1:27:51] to perfect the
[1:27:52] message but it's is already
[1:27:57] perfect that's why return Ministry
[1:27:59] people believe that they believe these
[1:28:01] little things I was out in California
[1:28:03] last weekend with a group of Spanish
[1:28:05] people all Spanish and they all are in
[1:28:07] the return Ministry are coming out of
[1:28:08] the return Ministry and they believe
[1:28:11] that brother brandom has to return
[1:28:13] because he's got to fulfill a couple of
[1:28:14] these
[1:28:15] quotes and if we believe that then what
[1:28:18] we're saying is we have an imperfect
[1:28:22] word because in the the days of the
[1:28:24] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:28:27] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:28:31] be finished so all the Mysteries has to
[1:28:35] be made known because he's a seventh
[1:28:39] angel that's why we're not looking for
[1:28:41] him to come back we got a perfect
[1:28:42] message everything we have need of for
[1:28:46] Perfection is found right there on 1200
[1:28:50] tapes and he said you're going to eat in
[1:28:52] plenty
[1:28:54] you're not going to starve to death now
[1:28:55] if you starve it's because you won't
[1:28:58] eat this is one thing you don't want to
[1:29:00] go on a diet with you want to Gorge
[1:29:03] yourself you want to get gluttonous with
[1:29:06] this word and just fill your appetite
[1:29:09] with it because this is what's going to
[1:29:10] change your body and God put it no other
[1:29:14] age could capture a voice and put it on
[1:29:17] tape unlike this age what was God doing
[1:29:20] God was saving the best for last cuz he
[1:29:23] knew there was going to be a bride that
[1:29:25] was going to need this word because
[1:29:27] Satan was going to create an Eden but
[1:29:29] out of that Eden he was going to raise
[1:29:31] up a brid tree and she was going to
[1:29:33] overcome because he already spoke
[1:29:35] overcoming power to her I will restore
[1:29:39] all the
[1:29:41] [Applause]
[1:29:42] years I will complete what I had
[1:29:48] started brother bam says God promised
[1:29:51] that he would bring his bride out what
[1:29:53] would he do there would be a seed and
[1:29:56] there'd be a light in the evening time
[1:29:58] how would he do all these things just
[1:30:00] exactly by the way he he original planed
[1:30:03] in the Old Testament and New Testament
[1:30:04] it isn't through denominations notice he
[1:30:07] says how will he take his bride by the
[1:30:10] word not by a new cart not by some
[1:30:13] theolog or theological idea but
[1:30:16] according to his word he will identify
[1:30:20] her so the evening time message
[1:30:24] it's going to have an evening time
[1:30:27] people and it's going to bring evening
[1:30:29] time results that means there's going to
[1:30:31] be a people that's going to believe
[1:30:33] it so the message that we preach is a
[1:30:37] message that's calling out a
[1:30:40] bride not some intellectual knowledge
[1:30:42] not some understanding but it's the word
[1:30:44] that's identifying her because there's a
[1:30:46] word on the inside of her and when that
[1:30:49] word is preached there's a deep and that
[1:30:51] deep response to the word
[1:30:54] brother B says when the Deep call it to
[1:30:56] the Deep he said it takes more than just
[1:30:59] joining a church it takes more than
[1:31:00] shaking hands with the preacher it takes
[1:31:02] more than living a good straight life it
[1:31:04] takes something to satisfy the inside of
[1:31:07] you that pours down from God into the
[1:31:09] soul the Deep calling into the deep at
[1:31:12] the noise of thy water spouts oh Lord
[1:31:14] the Deep calling to the Deep what is the
[1:31:16] Deep the word on the inside of you that
[1:31:18] seed that God planted there before the
[1:31:20] foundation of the world and when the
[1:31:22] word which is the message of the hour
[1:31:25] God's voice for this day begins to speak
[1:31:27] to that seed on the inside it can't help
[1:31:29] but to come to life it can't help but to
[1:31:32] respond to the word and he said when you
[1:31:34] heard that you heard from your
[1:31:38] theophany I'm here to tell you you can't
[1:31:42] lose my we are should be the happiest
[1:31:44] people in Elton
[1:31:47] Kentucky man somebody need to tap your
[1:31:50] neighbor tell them to smile a while give
[1:31:52] your face a rest
[1:31:54] we got a reason to Rejoice
[1:31:57] Church no other age has had a message
[1:32:00] like this message and for God to let
[1:32:03] that message cross your ears and come
[1:32:05] into your heart and produce the same
[1:32:08] signs the same wonders the same love and
[1:32:11] the same life what am I what is it it's
[1:32:13] declaring that you are the final voice
[1:32:16] to the final age God is putting his
[1:32:18] print upon you that he will finish it
[1:32:21] through your life
[1:32:24] God's permanently showing you are the
[1:32:26] bride the one that's been prophesied to
[1:32:29] come sages and great men have been
[1:32:32] waiting on this moment and can I say it
[1:32:35] we're
[1:32:36] here can I say it we're here if you've
[1:32:39] been looking at the news Church we're
[1:32:41] almost ready to leave this
[1:32:44] place oh there's fears of another war on
[1:32:47] the side but I ain't worried about that
[1:32:49] we're not fearing another Great War we
[1:32:51] got a promise we got a promise before
[1:32:54] that comes this bride's going to be
[1:32:56] taken up why because the word's been
[1:32:58] spoken and he will finish that
[1:33:03] word God's going to finish what he
[1:33:11] started
[1:33:13] notice Christ in the true church is a
[1:33:17] continuation of the book of Acts this is
[1:33:19] a quote that we quote and quote and
[1:33:21] quote and quote and quote but please
[1:33:22] don't let it just be a
[1:33:25] quote but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:33:28] how the Antichrist spirit will come into
[1:33:29] the church and defile it making it
[1:33:30] lukewarm and boy we have seen some
[1:33:32] lukewarm churches rise up in this day
[1:33:35] and I ain't talking about baptist and
[1:33:37] Presbyterian and Pentecostal I'm talking
[1:33:39] about
[1:33:40] message they have lost their
[1:33:44] fire notice but the Book of Revelation
[1:33:47] shows how the Antichrist spirit will
[1:33:48] come in the church and defile it making
[1:33:50] it lukewarm formal and Powerless it EXP
[1:33:53] oses Satan revealing his Works attempt
[1:33:56] the destruction of God's people and
[1:33:58] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:34:01] the time that he's cast into the Lake of
[1:34:03] Fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[1:34:06] he knows Satan knows that if the people
[1:34:08] get a true revelation of the true church
[1:34:11] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:34:14] and that she can do the greater work she
[1:34:17] will be an invincible
[1:34:21] Army I know some of y'all are really
[1:34:23] tired tonight but that should have
[1:34:24] struck a cord
[1:34:27] somewhere man I ain't never like going
[1:34:29] into a fight but when I knew I was going
[1:34:31] to come out being the Victor I had some
[1:34:34] questionable fights in my
[1:34:35] life but man when I knew that I was
[1:34:38] going to win I squared my shoulders back
[1:34:40] and I had fun with it what am I telling
[1:34:43] you if you can get a true revelation of
[1:34:45] the two Spirits within the framework of
[1:34:47] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:34:50] discern to withstand that Antichrist
[1:34:52] Spirit you will be an invincible Army
[1:34:55] that's why we preach to you the message
[1:34:57] that's why we preach to your faith
[1:34:58] that's why we preaching into a rure we
[1:35:00] want you to see the two Spirits within
[1:35:03] the framework so that you can by God's
[1:35:05] spirit recognize that that's God
[1:35:07] speaking to you and when God start
[1:35:09] speaking to you your faith will begin to
[1:35:11] rise up and then you square your
[1:35:13] shoulders
[1:35:15] back you're Invincible little
[1:35:19] bride you're Invincible let me just go
[1:35:21] some other places to where BR says here
[1:35:24] now notice Oh my he says now in the last
[1:35:28] days a true bride Church Christ seed
[1:35:30] will come to The Headstone she will be a
[1:35:32] super
[1:35:33] Church a super race as she nears him
[1:35:36] they and the bride will be so much like
[1:35:38] that they'll be in his very image this
[1:35:40] is in order to be United with him this
[1:35:43] will they will be one they will be the
[1:35:46] very manifestation of the word of the
[1:35:49] Living God and he says denominations
[1:35:51] cannot produce this wrong seed then he
[1:35:55] says in the pergan church age from a
[1:35:57] little group of true seed of the word
[1:35:59] God will present Christ with the Beloved
[1:36:01] bride she is Virgin of his word she is
[1:36:04] Virgin because she know no man's Creeds
[1:36:07] or dogmas but by and through the members
[1:36:09] of the Bride will be fulfilled all that
[1:36:11] was promised of God to be manifested in
[1:36:13] a
[1:36:15] virgin and then he had a prophecy I no
[1:36:17] longer call you church but I call you
[1:36:19] bride God showing a separation a
[1:36:22] distinction
[1:36:24] you're not the church but you're my
[1:36:26] bride you're a super race A different
[1:36:29] race as we said this past Sunday You're
[1:36:32] of a prophetic class of
[1:36:34] people then he goes on to say he says
[1:36:37] now there will be a time come forth when
[1:36:40] he could express himself in the fullness
[1:36:42] of his godhead his deity through his
[1:36:44] church have preeminence in his church oh
[1:36:46] my what the anointed man referring to
[1:36:50] Christ but now the anointed people
[1:36:56] anointed people he says oh my to bring
[1:36:59] back the anointed bride and bridegroom
[1:37:02] anointed by what accepting what Eve
[1:37:03] turned down and Adam coming back with
[1:37:06] the anointing of the word Oh my he said
[1:37:09] see Anointed with the word when Eve
[1:37:11] turned down he comes back and we accept
[1:37:14] and he's come back in this day with the
[1:37:17] word and Eve rejected that word she
[1:37:20] rejected that life but what he came back
[1:37:23] with the in this hour we accept it so we
[1:37:26] accept our position as bride we accept
[1:37:29] his life we accept his
[1:37:32] word oh don't you just love
[1:37:34] that he said now he the bridegroom he
[1:37:37] took away your shame he put it in the
[1:37:38] sea of forgivness by the washing of the
[1:37:40] water of the word he said that's what
[1:37:42] the Bible said and you're standing
[1:37:44] completely Justified as though you never
[1:37:46] did it in the
[1:37:48] beginning he goes oh this is my message
[1:37:50] to the church you're standing complete
[1:37:53] Justified like you never did it in the
[1:37:57] first
[1:37:58] place he says oh you're the
[1:38:04] pure he said you talk about our
[1:38:06] Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more
[1:38:08] thankful for that than anything I know
[1:38:10] he says you're the pure virtuous sinless
[1:38:13] Bride of the son of the Living God every
[1:38:16] man and woman that's born of the spirit
[1:38:17] of God and washed in the blood of Jesus
[1:38:20] and believes every word of God stands as
[1:38:22] though you never ever sin in the first
[1:38:25] place you are perfect what is he saying
[1:38:29] it is finished little bride you are
[1:38:32] perfect why a was it wasn't brother
[1:38:34] Thomas that made you perfect but the
[1:38:36] word made you perfect and the word blood
[1:38:39] for you and that's why you're perfect
[1:38:43] today he says you're standing completely
[1:38:45] you never sin in the first place God
[1:38:48] don't even know
[1:38:50] it so quit laying in the bed hashing it
[1:38:53] out

[1:38:57] you would have done it just forget about
[1:38:58] it pray about it ask forgiveness God
[1:39:01] don't even know what you're talking
[1:39:03] about he said God don't even know it's
[1:39:05] in the sea of forgiveness you never did
[1:39:08] it you were accused of it by the accuser
[1:39:11] but really from the beginning all right
[1:39:13] here we go back before the foundation of
[1:39:16] the world back in the beginning you
[1:39:18] would say you were predestinated to be a
[1:39:21] son and daughter of God and you're
[1:39:24] standing now oh Hallelujah I said you're

[1:41:37] with
[1:41:38] this he said there came up a little
[1:41:41] bride lovely in
[1:41:43] vision and I Heard a Voice by my side
[1:41:47] side of me say here's the preview of the
[1:41:50] bride and she came by and I noticed by
[1:41:52] the way she she was very lovely pretty
[1:41:54] young she was walking just in Step as
[1:41:57] she could not in a marsh just in a
[1:41:59] stride a
[1:42:01] woman you know how they walk gracefully
[1:42:05] ladylike that's the way she was walking
[1:42:08] coming to my left on this side and she
[1:42:12] went out of my sight and he said it was
[1:42:14] the prettiest bunch of clean dressed
[1:42:16] women I've ever seen in my life each one
[1:42:18] of them looked I was just dressed
[1:42:20] different they all had long hair and
[1:42:23] longer sleeves and skirts and so forth
[1:42:25] young women they look kind of say maybe
[1:42:27] 20 and she was the cleanest sweetest
[1:42:29] looking people I've ever
[1:42:31] seen she passed by
[1:42:53] test all right here we go he says now he
[1:42:58] says she was beautiful and said that
[1:43:01] that's the bride but now we're going to
[1:43:03] review the
[1:43:05] churches and when they came up each one
[1:43:08] look like they got worse I've never seen
[1:43:09] such a filthy bunch in my life I heard a
[1:43:13] noise and it's it said Here Comes the
[1:43:16] American group and he showed me the
[1:43:17] church and they come up from each age
[1:43:19] and how vulgar in the last one the last
[1:43:21] day Church age she was led by witch they
[1:43:24] were morally dressed so filthy looking
[1:43:26] they were marching to the time of
[1:43:28] twisting Rock and rolling those women
[1:43:29] throwing themselves just in twist with
[1:43:32] holding just a paper gray hypocritical
[1:43:34] you know gray looking paper holding in
[1:43:36] front of them like a hoola skirt holding
[1:43:38] in front of them and completely new from
[1:43:39] the waist up and they were marching or
[1:43:42] time twisting and carrying on with the
[1:43:44] music and walking up and that is the
[1:43:47] church and he said each one of them had
[1:43:49] their real short frizzy looking thing
[1:43:51] hair real short hair he looking all over
[1:43:54] real short haircut and full of makeup
[1:43:56] absolutely nothing but look like street
[1:43:59] prostitutes and he go when they passed
[1:44:01] by my heart fainted I thought well if
[1:44:03] that's what we've been trying to present
[1:44:05] to Christ as a bride all the efforts and
[1:44:08] things that man has put forth to try to
[1:44:10] bring forth the bride and vulgar and
[1:44:12] dirty and filthy looking prostitute like
[1:44:14] that to be a bride of Christ he said it
[1:44:16] made my heart
[1:44:18] sick and we find Church it look like
[1:44:21] Satan is one
[1:44:24] this is the church this is this is what
[1:44:26] we can present to God as a bride as a
[1:44:28] filthy
[1:44:30] looking
[1:44:33] Church twisting the rock and roll I
[1:44:36] remember when I was in the Baptist
[1:44:37] Church there was a group called Skillet
[1:44:38] that they invited to the church it was
[1:44:41] nothing but hardcore rock and roll
[1:44:43] headbanging type music in the house of
[1:44:47] God I didn't know that before I heard
[1:44:50] this but this is exactly the
[1:44:51] manifestation he saw saw what I saw with
[1:44:54] my natural
[1:44:55] eyes but he said the bride will come in
[1:44:58] preview
[1:44:59] again and I heard he goes and here the
[1:45:02] bride came behind and the very same
[1:45:04] looking bride that passed by at the
[1:45:06] beginning he goes oh my heart jumped for
[1:45:08] joy to know that there will be a bride
[1:45:11] she will be made of the same thing
[1:45:12] clothed in the same thing the one that
[1:45:15] was in the beginning she will be called
[1:45:17] he goes oh I know that's to be the truth
[1:45:18] that this isn't the truth and every
[1:45:20] Vision that I ever had back had been
[1:45:21] wrong so he said the bride passed by and
[1:45:24] she was perfectly in the same position
[1:45:27] the second time as she was the first
[1:45:29] time he said notice now others the
[1:45:31] others when they went off they went off
[1:45:33] into chaos and destruction but when he
[1:45:35] saw the bride she didn't go off into
[1:45:37] chaos and destruction she rose up in
[1:45:39] Victory what am I telling you little
[1:45:41] bride what that first bride was you are
[1:45:44] tonight you're the same what God
[1:45:47] established on the day of Pentecost is
[1:45:49] the same bride that he has here tonight
[1:45:53] you're perfect she's perfectly the
[1:45:55] second time like she was the first time
[1:45:58] oh Hallelujah aren't you so thankful and
[1:46:00] he said
[1:46:01] notice Masterpiece family has come again
[1:46:04] Christ and his bride ready to come the
[1:46:06] second Adam the second Eve ready now to
[1:46:08] return back to their home the whole
[1:46:10] picture has been Redemption from where
[1:46:12] it was bringing it back just exactly
[1:46:15] bringing it back again so we don't have
[1:46:17] to be afraid of the the political
[1:46:19] environment in the land around us and
[1:46:21] wars and tensions of war and fear of
[1:46:22] nuclear war and anything like that what
