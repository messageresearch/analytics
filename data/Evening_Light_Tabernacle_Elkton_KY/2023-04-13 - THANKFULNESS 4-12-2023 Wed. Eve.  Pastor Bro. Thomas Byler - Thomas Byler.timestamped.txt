[31:10] ministering coming Sunday amen to take
[31:12] the Sunday service amen turn your bibles
[31:15] if you will we'll just get right into
[31:16] the word
[31:18] amen
[31:24] let's go to Book of Revelations
[31:28] amen I've dressed down a little bit and
[31:30] I hope nobody Minds amen I just don't
[31:33] doesn't quite feel right but it feels
[31:35] good amen so amen I said I'm just going
[31:37] to dress down I says no maybe I'll wrote
[31:39] and I said no go ahead I felt like the
[31:41] Lord give me the go ahead so anyway
[31:43] praise the Lord let's go to Revelations
[31:45] the seventh chapter revelation 7.
[31:48] amen and we'll begin with
[31:51] ah
[31:53] verse 9 and after this I beheld and lo a
[31:56] great multitude which no man could
[31:58] number of all Nations and kindreds and
[32:00] people and tongues stood Before the
[32:02] Throne and before the lamb
[32:04] both with their white robes and Palms in
[32:07] their hands
[32:08] amen and
[32:09] cried with Allah to our god which sayeth
[32:12] upon the throne and unto the lamb and
[32:15] all the Angels round about the throne
[32:18] and about the elders and the four beasts
[32:20] fell down before the throne on their
[32:22] faces and worshiped God saying amen
[32:26] blessing and glory and wisdom and
[32:28] Thanksgiving and honor and glory and
[32:31] might be unto our God forever and ever a
[32:35] man amen now I'm if I'm not wrong
[32:41] this was uh the Jews that I believe
[32:44] brother bam call this that this was the
[32:46] Jews and so forth I know that the
[32:48] different times that this is spoken and
[32:50] it's different groups of people amen but
[32:52] and I don't know for sure about some of
[32:55] the ones that we read over around the
[32:56] fourth chapter uh you know just what
[32:59] which group it was but I do know that
[33:02] it's the same Angels amen same elders
[33:05] and amen saying the same thing amen so
[33:08] this is what's going on in heaven now
[33:10] the question tonight is which one of
[33:12] these words amen are we going to go with
[33:15] and I think the one that I haven't
[33:16] really covered and I really wanted to
[33:19] I was leaning towards the glory of
[33:21] Victory and overcoming amen that's kind
[33:24] of what I was studying on until it just
[33:27] kind of changed a little bit amen and it
[33:30] went to uh uh not from that from the
[33:34] glory of Victory Amen to Thanksgiving
[33:36] amen Thanksgiving
[33:38] amen now notice that they worship God
[33:41] saying that all of these words and
[33:44] including Thanksgiving then I will jump
[33:47] down to be unto our God forever and ever
[33:51] amen make this blessings to reading of
[33:53] the words you can be seated now Sunday
[33:55] we spoke on Amen riches didn't we amen
[33:59] riches amen that he's worthy of riches
[34:01] we talk about what riches are the only
[34:03] thing that you can take with you that's
[34:05] truly rich is your character the kind of
[34:08] person that you are amen your
[34:10] personality we might call it in that
[34:12] you're the kind of person that you are
[34:13] your character and so forth It's the
[34:15] only one only thing we can take amen and
[34:18] that character is made by sufferings by
[34:22] trials by tests by chastisements amen
[34:26] and all these different things and all
[34:28] the trials that come our way amen are to
[34:31] mold us into the character of Jesus
[34:34] Christ and that is the gold and end that
[34:37] is uh accepted by God and that's the
[34:40] goal that God was looking for was the
[34:42] character that is made out of pure
[34:45] suffering amen and a lot of times we
[34:48] suffer and we've seen where Peter said
[34:50] amen that if you are suffer wrongfully
[34:52] that's when you really get a blessing
[34:54] for not if you suffer rightfully but if
[34:57] you suffer wrongfully that's where the
[34:59] real that's what God has said ordained
[35:02] us to do amen because that's when we
[35:04] truly find out what kind of person we
[35:06] are amen so praise the Lord but tonight
[35:08] amen I wonder with the help of the Lord
[35:10] going over and thinking about this word
[35:13] Thanksgiving amen Thanksgiving so we see
[35:16] here that
[35:18] um
[35:19] Thanksgiving and it led me to several
[35:22] different words amen and uh before I get
[35:26] into that I want to I want to just
[35:29] say a few words perhaps
[35:32] um if I could off of the subject kind of
[35:35] but we're talking I was thinking about
[35:37] uh what the prophet of God said about us
[35:40] staying in Revival amen I remember you
[35:42] know as you said that we're to stay in
[35:45] Revival amen and I've made the comment
[35:48] that I don't guess you'll find anywhere
[35:50] amen and so but how that we shouldn't
[35:53] need Revival amen you know so I think
[35:56] another word for staying in Revival
[35:58] would be or stay revived
[36:02] would that be okay stay revived amen
[36:07] stay in there amen or as we might put it
[36:09] in another words uh Jesus said be hot
[36:13] amen and stay hot
[36:17] and if there's any direction that I want
[36:19] to take us into the church is to get hot
[36:22] for God and to stay hot for God
[36:26] and how do we do that and I got to
[36:28] thinking how do you stay hot how do you
[36:31] stay how do you stay revived
[36:33] and you know I thought about it and I
[36:35] thought about how that uh whether it was
[36:37] Muhammad Ali whether it was Mike Tyson
[36:40] or whether it's any fighter that becomes
[36:42] Great and Powerful and uh knocks out the
[36:45] enemy and there's a there they hold the
[36:47] world title they're Victorious they're
[36:49] uh on top of their uh
[36:54] name so to speak you know and they're
[36:56] right up there you know but you know
[36:58] what they have to do is they have to
[37:00] keep exercise don't they
[37:03] they can't let up and start eating too
[37:05] much and not exercising every day the
[37:08] Bible talks about how that we have to
[37:09] exercise our faith we got to exercise
[37:11] all these different things in order to
[37:14] do it another place the Bible talks
[37:15] about trimming your lamps trim your
[37:18] Wicks isn't that right you gotta keep
[37:20] keep your wing quick trim and Brother
[37:22] Band says you know just like your
[37:23] natural body if you don't eat naturally
[37:25] you're gonna die he says that same type
[37:28] goes with your spiritual body that if
[37:30] you don't eat spiritually you're gonna
[37:32] get cold on God you're gonna get away
[37:34] from the spirit amen and before you know
[37:36] you've got calluses you've got all kinds
[37:39] of moss back you've got it all kinds of
[37:41] things that come in if you don't stay
[37:43] Sharp
[37:44] Amen to that man ever that's up and then
[37:46] you know a lot of times it's because of
[37:48] old age or because you're getting weaker
[37:49] somebody comes and beats that guy don't
[37:51] he amen because that's humanly that's
[37:54] natural but let me say this let me bleed
[37:56] from the bride of Christ we wouldn't be
[37:58] the kind of people that doesn't get
[37:59] older and weak in our in our faith in
[38:02] God we want to have to stay strong
[38:04] in order to say victorious
[38:08] amen so I thought that's right that's
[38:10] how we stay in Revival amen I hate to
[38:13] say it but you really need to pray like
[38:15] Daniel then you pray in the morning you
[38:17] pray at noon time you pray in the
[38:19] evening you feed on God
[38:21] amen and Daniel say in Revival you can
[38:24] keep power keep the power of the Holy
[38:25] Ghost let me tell you that's how you
[38:27] keep your house clean that's how you
[38:28] keep amen your sharp sword and keep the
[38:31] devil away and keep the right attitude
[38:34] keep the right spirit
[38:37] but you get away from that and all kinds
[38:39] of things come in
[38:40] God bless you good to see y'all amen
[38:43] so praise the Lord amen I thought about
[38:45] that that's how we do it stay in Revival
[38:48] God wants us hot
[38:50] amen can't be lazy but you gotta keep
[38:54] feeding yourself keep feeding amen
[38:56] otherwise amen it goes the other way and
[38:59] the enemy comes in and robs you of your
[39:03] blessing
[39:04] amen so we think about let's think about
[39:07] this first of all amen I want to say
[39:09] this that first of all amen before you
[39:11] can be thankful now God is worthy of a
[39:14] lot of thanks isn't he
[39:16] sure he is he's worth of all thanks
[39:19] praise the Lord we're thankful that we
[39:23] can amen give God the glory that is to
[39:25] him all right amen my ran out of paper
[39:27] so I'm looking for my paper but I wrote
[39:29] it on the back side for once I use back
[39:32] by being conservative here all right not
[39:34] really but anyway
[39:36] all right let's look at this so we got
[39:38] here
[39:39] amen first of all I believe it's in uh
[39:42] uh let's go to Philippians
[39:46] Philippians and first we'll go to first
[39:50] Thessalonians first Thessalonians if you
[39:53] want
[39:54] let's see what the scripture says about
[39:56] thankfulness
[39:58] amen
[39:59] praise the Lord
[40:01] and I want to say that this thankfulness
[40:04] I believe is also a part of the
[40:06] character of the bride of Christ
[40:09] amen it's part of our makeup just like
[40:12] giving God glory and worshiping God it's
[40:15] all part of us amen
[40:18] amen and being thankful amen uh an
[40:21] attitude of gratitude now tonight's
[40:22] service amen I've wrote down here that
[40:24] is really a remembering service it's
[40:27] something that I've spoke on many times
[40:29] but I you know maybe we need to just
[40:31] have our minds stirred up by the way of
[40:33] remembrance amen
[40:35] be forgetful sometime amen
[40:38] all right if you talk about this so and
[40:40] I noticed in uh
[40:41] Thessalon first Thessalonians the fifth
[40:44] chapter in verse 16 says Rejoice
[40:47] Evermore
[40:52] does that mean forever I mean always
[40:55] rejoicing
[40:56] I'm rejoicing night and days
[40:59] that'd be all right rejoice
[41:02] Rejoice rejoice and again I say rejoice
[41:06] rejoice in the Lord oh if it just comes
[41:08] to mind is that all right and again I
[41:11] say rejoice
[41:12] how many believe you need to rejoice
[41:15] many times over in the Book of
[41:17] Revelations we can say rejoice you his
[41:19] Saints amen praise the Lord we're
[41:22] practicing aren't we not just practicing
[41:24] but actually doing what we are what
[41:26] we're going to do over there pray
[41:28] without ceasing and in everything
[41:32] give thanks
[41:34] for this is the will of God in Christ
[41:37] Jesus concerning you amen if you really
[41:40] want to know more about it go back over
[41:42] into and look uh David one place he says
[41:45] I will wake up at midnight and give
[41:48] thanks to the Lord
[41:50] hey man he wakes up at 12 o'clock
[41:53] thank you Jesus
[41:56] [Music]
[42:01] because he's worthy of things isn't he
[42:03] he's worthy of being appreciated and
[42:06] I'll tell you what this to being the
[42:09] thing of being thankful a lot of time
[42:10] amen it means sometimes that we have to
[42:13] take inventory we have to look back at
[42:15] what we can be thankful for
[42:17] because I'll tell you right now this
[42:19] generation of people is the most
[42:21] unthankful people that I know of
[42:25] my my
[42:27] and I won't go too much into it but I
[42:29] believe it's in Roman the second chapter
[42:30] it talks about homosexuality it knows
[42:32] whenever it was over into there he says
[42:34] they didn't retain God in their
[42:36] knowledge and neither were they thankful
[42:38] they become unthankful and then off they
[42:40] went you have to be thankful
[42:43] amen and my do we have a lot to be
[42:45] thankful for all right don't we amen
[42:48] in rev I'll just read one Psalms 105
[42:51] verse 1 it says oh give thanks unto the
[42:54] Lord call upon his name make known his
[42:56] deeds among the People Sing unto him
[42:59] sing Psalms unto him talk ye of all of
[43:02] his wondrous works
[43:06] praise be to God Amen
[43:08] amen let's think about it we've got to
[43:10] take inventory see what we have to be
[43:12] thankful for amen and first of all I
[43:15] want to say why don't we talk about
[43:16] several different things first of all we
[43:18] realize that a person that is thankful
[43:21] is usually a person that's satisfied
[43:26] is that right
[43:29] it is a person that's content
[43:32] satisfaction and contentment
[43:38] amen it's two words let me tell you it's
[43:42] two words in other words I want to put
[43:44] in there amen and then a contented
[43:46] person is happy
[43:51] happy
[43:53] a contented person is a happy person
[43:57] [Music]
[44:00] whoa
[44:05] oh my
[44:07] ah
[44:09] all right a bunch of thoughts going
[44:11] through my head
[44:14] I'll go ahead and share it with you all
[44:15] right I was at home studying this and my
[44:18] thumb was hurting and this stuff that
[44:20] just wants to hang on to me and I was
[44:22] kind of you know just kind of
[44:24] wowzy wowzy woo and I said how am I
[44:27] gonna preach this you know I don't feel
[44:29] all that happy
[44:32] I don't feel all that but you know my
[44:34] time I got here I got out here the Lord
[44:36] just knowing hello we don't always feel
[44:39] like it
[44:40] doesn't matter we still preach the word
[44:42] isn't that right
[44:44] amen so that's what I was thinking I was
[44:46] debating on whether I want to tell you
[44:47] that or not but amen we don't always
[44:50] feel like it but we we got to be happy
[44:52] for the Lord and be thankful amen so a
[44:54] contented person amen contented I like
[44:57] that not just content but satisfied A
[45:00] Satisfied person in what I was doing
[45:02] where I was going with that is those
[45:03] three words amen satisfied contentment
[45:07] and happy those three and joy and having
[45:11] Joy
[45:13] how many knows that that's truly what
[45:15] what the whole world is looking for
[45:19] the whole world out there is thirsting
[45:22] for satisfaction
[45:26] ain't nobody but what likes to be
[45:28] satisfied because if you're not
[45:29] satisfied you're a miserable person
[45:36] amen I was thinking the other day you
[45:39] know I want to make sure my wife is
[45:40] happy
[45:42] because if my wife's happy happy wife
[45:43] happy life
[45:45] is that right and if she's in a better
[45:47] half so to speak you know you got to
[45:49] make sure she's happy you know I thought
[45:51] you got to do a better job
[45:55] amen
[45:57] praise the Lord
[45:59] all right so we think about this let's
[46:02] look at another verse here now
[46:05] um Paul let's think about this let's
[46:09] just read it first of all let's read the
[46:10] quote First only quote I got
[46:12] I've used this before identified with
[46:14] Christ in 59 he better bam says you know
[46:17] he wanted to take a tax but he says you
[46:19] know there is this country today
[46:22] so many this satisfied people and it's
[46:26] amazing when you get around to find out
[46:28] so much this
[46:30] satisfaction
[46:33] oh my now notice
[46:35] he says uh talking about people blowing
[46:38] their brains out this out of the other
[46:39] but I call them unhappy
[46:41] unhappy people
[46:44] folks and I'll tell you what if anybody
[46:45] that goes to a garage closes their
[46:48] garage up and and and closes the windows
[46:52] of the car I'll put a hose from the gas
[46:54] from the tailpipe into the car and
[46:58] you have got to be seriously unhappy
[47:03] you kill yourself huh
[47:05] or a gun to you you have got to be the
[47:07] whole world is unhappy people are
[47:08] unhappy people dissatisfied they're not
[47:11] content
[47:13] amen and therefore certainly not
[47:15] thankful
[47:16] but the more happy you are the more
[47:18] content you are
[47:20] you can't be that way without being
[47:21] thankful
[47:24] they'll just tell you can you imagine
[47:26] the immigrants right now that have to go
[47:28] from Guatemala they come from El
[47:30] Salvador to come from Haiti and they
[47:32] have to swim across the that Big River
[47:34] to uh Rio Grande or whatever it is and a
[47:37] lot of them drowned and all this other
[47:39] stuff that goes on I want to get into
[47:41] the country and if they ever make it
[47:43] through that wall if they ever get on
[47:45] the other side they've made some happy
[47:47] people don't you reckon
[47:49] opportunity
[47:51] [Music]
[47:57] can you imagine the joy the happiness
[47:59] they can have just to be in this country
[48:03] now I thought you know when we started
[48:06] looking at our blessings look at the
[48:07] blessing not only are we you know we're
[48:09] not just immigrants but you and I are
[48:11] citizens I don't have to worry about
[48:14] getting towed back out I'm a citizen are
[48:17] you a citizen not
[48:20] you can be happier than he is he's
[48:22] illegal
[48:26] they've got so much to be happy for I
[48:29] got to thinking you know I get to jump
[48:31] in my truck and I get to put it in gear
[48:33] I used to have to go and I had to get
[48:35] the horse out of the song I had to put
[48:37] the harness on I had to do this go down
[48:40] the road real slow like
[48:43] if you go somewhere it's a half a day to
[48:44] go about a mile and a half and back
[48:49] all right
[48:51] is that right
[48:55] but that's to be happy about
[48:57] now that's just natural things what
[48:59] about the spiritual things
[49:01] face be to God
[49:06] God wants his children happy
[49:09] my
[49:12] oh my
[49:14] God said in Isaiah
[49:16] listen everyone that thirsts has Come Ye
[49:18] to the waters and he that has no money
[49:20] come by eat yeah come buy wine and milk
[49:24] without money without price why do you
[49:26] spend money for that which is not bread
[49:28] and you labor for that which satisfies
[49:31] not
[49:32] how many know well I'll tell you what I
[49:34] gotta become a billionaire I gotta
[49:35] become a millionaire I gotta have some
[49:37] money's money and I'll be happy no
[49:38] they're never happy
[49:40] they're never content they're never
[49:42] satisfied
[49:44] amen I got to thinking you know some
[49:46] people let me tell you something amen
[49:48] your wife will never satisfy you
[49:51] a new job won't satisfy you
[49:56] more money won't satisfy you
[49:59] this church won't satisfy you
[50:02] no church will satisfy you
[50:05] you why won't none of them will but let
[50:07] me tell you something you get the
[50:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and

[50:17] satisfied with your neighbors you're
[50:19] satisfied with your boss you're just
[50:21] satisfied
[50:23] but he takes the satisfaction in here if

[50:49] praise the Lord
[50:51] oh my I'm satisfied you know why I'm

[50:55] because I believe that a person can walk
[50:58] with God every day you can live a
[51:01] Victorious Life
[51:03] every day
[51:05] but you got to stay on your toes you got
[51:07] to stay prayed up Don't Let The Devil
[51:09] come in there somehow he'll try anyway
[51:11] to come in there and to rob you of your
[51:14] joy he'll rob you of your smile he'll
[51:16] rob you of your happiness
[51:19] if you possibly can in any way that he
[51:21] can
[51:22] amen
[51:25] okay
[51:30] praise the Lord
[51:31] Paul said in first Timothy 6 and verse
[51:35] 6.
[51:36] godliness with contentment
[51:39] is Great Gate
[51:42] praise the Lord
[51:47] Glory if you've got the Holy Ghost if
[51:52] you got his righteousness on the inside
[51:53] if you've got that godliness and you're
[51:57] content with that that is
[52:00] priceless
[52:04] that is great gain because he was
[52:06] talking about people that man disputing
[52:08] perverse disputings of men with corrupt
[52:10] Minds destitute the truth supposing that
[52:12] gain is godliness from such withdraw
[52:15] yourself
[52:16] amen
[52:17] you need to make all the money you want
[52:19] to ain't gonna give you no happiness it
[52:21] most likely get you more sorrow
[52:23] more headaches more troubles
[52:25] amen but aren't you glad aren't we glad
[52:29] tonight there's a water that we can
[52:30] drink and it ain't no water H2O amen we
[52:34] can eat a steak but it's not that kind
[52:35] of steak it is a spiritual snake a man
[52:38] that absolutely satisfies
[52:42] I'm satisfied without the cottage pillow
[52:46] maybe a little silver and a little gold
[52:48] I ain't got gonna have nothing
[52:50] just as long as you got the Holy Ghost
[52:53] can be as satisfied
[52:55] human be there ain't nothing better
[52:58] I like to get around satisfied people
[53:01] don't you like to be around somebody
[53:02] that's satisfied
[53:06] man you can just sit under evergreen
[53:08] tree for a million years that's what
[53:10] we're gonna do when we get to heaven
[53:12] let's just sit under every Green Tree
[53:13] and just enjoy this
[53:15] just enjoy this
[53:21] oh Mike just comes to mind you know why
[53:22] sometimes a lot of times we get it off
[53:24] the track
[53:26] we get unhappy
[53:28] because we do like Eve did
[53:31] Eve was in perfection
[53:34] how could it be any better
[53:36] than what he had it but Eve wasn't
[53:38] satisfied
[53:41] was she she thought there was something
[53:44] else
[53:45] that may be a little better
[53:48] why can't us humans leave good enough
[53:51] alone
[53:53] man if something's working don't fix it
[53:57] if God's blessing you
[53:59] don't fix that it's fixed already
[54:02] because I guarantee you get your hands
[54:04] in it and it's going to get messed up
[54:06] isn't that right brother bam said that
[54:08] about the Pentecostals he said about
[54:10] those other ages especially the
[54:12] Pentecostals he said this should have
[54:13] kept going to what it was Mr Susan
[54:15] Street the God was blessing and he was
[54:17] had them all unified but no he said man
[54:20] I have to get their dirty hands into it
[54:21] they had to have something into it
[54:23] something they had to do in it he says
[54:26] and he messed everything up
[54:28] isn't that what Nathan did everything
[54:30] was going good and God was blessing but
[54:34] they had an idea you know you're not the
[54:35] only Holy One
[54:37] he tried to have something to do into it
[54:39] amen whenever God's blessing you and
[54:41] you're happy in the Lord stay that way
[54:50] because I'm telling you if you get
[54:51] yourself that's why we have to Die daily
[54:55] because that self always wants to eject
[54:57] itself
[54:58] let me eject this and this is that way
[55:00] this is a no no that's blessing it just
[55:03] hold on to a very very steady right
[55:04] there
[55:05] stay right there with it
[55:08] amen because you can do serious chaos
[55:12] if you get man and yourself into it
[55:15] amen
[55:17] praise the Lord
[55:21] all right
[55:24] let us be glad how many believe God
[55:27] wants you to be glad let us be glad
[55:28] Revelation says let us be glad and
[55:32] rejoice
[55:33] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[55:36] I believe we can be what glad
[55:38] we can be happy well I'm happy in the
[55:41] Lord anyway and it really doesn't matter
[55:44] what come my way today I'm gonna wear a
[55:46] smile hold my head up high and say I'm
[55:49] happy in the Lord
[55:51] anyway
[55:54] every day
[55:56] I just one day
[55:58] but every day
[56:00] not just Sunday
[56:01] or Wednesday
[56:03] but every day
[56:05] is sweeter than the day before
[56:08] amen
[56:09] listen look
[56:11] with godliness is great game for we
[56:13] brought nothing into this world and it's
[56:15] certain that we will carry nothing out
[56:19] and having food and Raymond let us be
[56:23] there with happy thankful content
[56:28] everybody got food
[56:31] everybody got water and clothes
[56:35] [Music]
[56:39] everybody can dance
[56:41] Paul didn't even have that he said
[56:43] Timothy I'm getting cold can you go get
[56:44] my clothes can you go get my coat he was
[56:47] in prison in shackles and everything
[56:48] else
[56:49] he said man you know if you have food in
[56:52] Raymond you ought to be a happy
[56:54] Christian
[56:58] they're not gonna carry none of that
[57:00] with them you're not going to carry
[57:01] anything with you except for your
[57:03] character and what you got already
[57:04] inside of there so you can be happy
[57:06] because of what you have how many is
[57:08] with me you can be happy and content
[57:10] because of what you have in here
[57:20] one more scripture and I quote
[57:23] them close
[57:25] sometime after that
[57:30] all right
[57:32] Philippians 4 and verse 11 Paul says for
[57:37] I speak in respect of one for I have
[57:39] learned
[57:40] in whatsoever State I am
[57:43] there with to be content
[57:46] wow now I'm sure Paul was talking about
[57:49] the situation and that God allowed him
[57:52] to get into
[57:53] now folks when I get myself into trouble
[57:55] and I know I've done wrong and I'm not
[57:57] where I'm supposed to be I get very very
[58:00] discontented
[58:03] I'm not happy there I'm not going to
[58:05] stay content in that state
[58:07] but when God allows you to get in bad
[58:09] places
[58:11] remember we're talking about suffering
[58:13] he says you know whenever you suffer
[58:14] you're called to suffer you're going to
[58:16] go suffering's gonna happen so that
[58:18] you'll learn to get on your knees and
[58:20] rely on God and it talk to God about it
[58:25] let him handle that
[58:26] amen
[58:28] that's what it's for
[58:30] and he said you know we've got the God
[58:33] wants you to conduct yourself with joy
[58:36] in the midst of the trials that God
[58:37] allows what I gotta be happy in the
[58:41] middle of my trial
[58:42] really
[58:44] that's what he said
[58:47] all this
[58:49] Paul was always happy he was always
[58:50] content whatever state he was in
[58:53] you don't believe me I know how to be a
[58:56] beast and I know how to abound
[58:59] everywhere in all things I am in
[59:01] destruction both to be full and to be
[59:04] hungry both to abound and to suffer need
[59:07] I can do all things through Christ with
[59:10] strength of me
[59:16] amen
[59:18] isn't that something how Paul could say
[59:20] something good after all that something
[59:22] positive
[59:24] amen
[59:28] don't you like a preacher that
[59:30] lifts you up
[59:33] a preacher that encourages you
[59:36] because that's the word of God isn't
[59:38] that right the word of God encourages
[59:39] you
[59:40] oh you're not going to have a flowery
[59:42] bed of these anybody that thinks this
[59:43] life is the flower bed of ease
[59:46] amen no it's not never meant to be
[59:50] but the one that helps you go through it
[59:51] is in here
[59:53] one that takes care of it all
[59:58] you know what I was about to say
[1:00:00] I understand why people shoot
[1:00:01] theirselves because that's about what
[1:00:03] I'd want to do if I wouldn't have God
[1:00:05] I'd want to shoot myself
[1:00:07] because it would be so miserable
[1:00:10] then that's why they do is because they
[1:00:12] don't have a God no hope
[1:00:14] without hope without God and turmoil and
[1:00:18] hell on Earth so to speak and it just
[1:00:20] ended
[1:00:22] because that's like without God
[1:00:24] what would you do
[1:00:25] now you need to understand what brother
[1:00:27] bam says isn't it a wonderful thing to
[1:00:29] be a Christian
[1:00:33] thank you Lord

[1:01:35] many knows that a Christian

[1:01:40] it's part of the atmosphere that a
[1:01:42] person creates that other people want to
[1:01:45] be around
[1:01:46] I believe that
[1:01:48] don't you like to be around a person
[1:01:49] that has a smile on their face
[1:01:53] if they got a frown

[1:06:01] that's in Christ
[1:06:04] amen I thank the Lord
[1:06:07] it's like that rabbit
[1:06:09] where the hounds of hell are after it
[1:06:11] and it's dodging it
[1:06:13] that dog is running like crazy
[1:06:17] and that rabbit had to do a sharp cheek
[1:06:20] to the right and the dog can't turn that
[1:06:22] fast and it gives that rabbit just a
[1:06:24] little more Advantage all of the
[1:06:25] quickness of that rabbit is keeping the
[1:06:27] dog back
[1:06:28] but he's got to get to that rock power
[1:06:30] there's a hole where he can get down to
[1:06:33] that rock pile and my idea says he goes
[1:06:36] down the street stretch he looks back he
[1:06:38] sees that dog gaining on him amen he's
[1:06:40] only gonna have a split second and then
[1:06:43] he dives into that hole and the dog dies
[1:06:46] into that hole he gets his face stuck
[1:06:48] and wow hurts him a little bit because
[1:06:51] he don't mean there too hard
[1:06:56] that little rabbit he could just say
[1:06:58] thank you Lord for saving me thank you
[1:07:03] Lord for setting me free he'll never get
[1:07:06] through that rock I am in the cleft of
[1:07:08] the rock I'm hiding in the craft of The
[1:07:10] Rock
[1:07:11] that devil that wants to do this to me
[1:07:13] and make me feel bad and all of this he
[1:07:14] can't touch me because I'm gonna clap of
[1:07:17] The Rock

[1:07:22] time that Paul David talked about amen

[1:13:39] to cook you got to make a fire of some
[1:13:40] kind
[1:13:41] of course they got little coal oils and
[1:13:43] burners nowadays you know but

[1:14:22] don't bring you happy let's do that
[1:14:24] never enough
[1:14:26] how many knows that whenever you ain't

[1:14:32] nothing ever is good enough
[1:14:35] you will always complain you will always
[1:14:37] be dissatisfied unless you got the total
[1:14:40] satisfaction
[1:14:42] right in here
[1:14:46] doesn't matter if you don't have
[1:14:47] anything I thought about that black man
[1:14:50] I forget his name now the one that I
[1:14:52] guess was the leader of the Zuzu Street
[1:14:53] and how that he couldn't even go into
[1:14:55] the church where this man was preaching
[1:14:57] and had a really wonderful preaching he
[1:14:59] had to sit on the back steps back there
[1:15:02] by the door and put his ear up there
[1:15:05] but he never complained
[1:15:07] he was happy I get to hear it
[1:15:10] oh can you imagine today
[1:15:13] wow people wouldn't be that happy with
[1:15:15] they
[1:15:15] not that content just to be able to hear
[1:15:17] the word of God
[1:15:19] Lord help us
[1:15:21] amen
[1:15:23] everybody
[1:15:24] ought to be happy with really nothing to
[1:15:26] be unhappy about amen
[1:15:29] and yet people are more unhappy than
[1:15:33] ever
[1:15:34] more empty more dissatisfied than ever
[1:15:37] one tattoo is Never Enough one earring
[1:15:41] is Never Enough we got to do the nose
[1:15:44] we gotta do something else and something
[1:15:46] else why do you think they look so
[1:15:48] hideous out there

[1:15:52] well I'm here to tell you it is more and
[1:15:55] more now that you see two women together
[1:15:57] and two men together
[1:15:58] more and more Right Here Local is that
[1:16:01] right it's getting worse and worse
[1:16:05] why because they never
[1:16:08] quenched that thirst
[1:16:10] they never get satisfied
[1:16:13] and they're never thankful
[1:16:15] for what they have
[1:16:18] amen

[1:16:31] in Florida and then so forth
[1:16:33] people in big churches and so forth and
[1:16:35] discontent unhappy people that there is
[1:16:39] just because you're in a message search
[1:16:40] don't mean you're a happy person don't
[1:16:42] mean you're a Content person
[1:16:45] don't mean nothing
[1:16:46] absolutely nothing
[1:16:49] the only thing that means something is
[1:16:51] is the holy ghost in your heart
[1:16:54] is Christ in there

[1:17:24] Christian don't worry about getting more
[1:17:25] God's always going to give you more
[1:17:27] he just does at least that's my
[1:17:30] experience
[1:17:32] if anything you got to push it away say
[1:17:34] God I don't want that responsibility I
[1:17:36] don't want that much huh
[1:17:39] sure He blesses us
[1:17:41] he says but when you're full now don't
[1:17:43] forget me amen
[1:17:45] he's none of your fat don't forget me
[1:17:48] I got to thinking about it the land we
[1:17:51] live in what we have what I have Lord
[1:17:54] help me to be satisfied
[1:17:57] with what God has given me
[1:18:00] satisfied
