[32:54] amen
[32:56] my heal my body when I was sick he
[32:59] surely been good to me amen praise the
[33:02] Lord all right let's um turn our bibles
[33:05] if you will to Matthew the 19th Chapter
[33:07] Matthew 19 it was quite something how
[33:10] that I was um thinking about this
[33:14] scripture amen and the bearing of it and
[33:17] I thought Bo that would make a good
[33:19] title and then uh I got to thinking
[33:22] about something else and and the Lord
[33:24] seemed to lay something on my heart to
[33:26] speak on tonight amen and it went back
[33:29] right back to this same scripture amen
[33:31] so the Lord works in mysterious ways
[33:33] isn't that right so we'll read this
[33:35] scripture in Matthew 19 for for a little
[33:38] bit tonight amen Matthew 19 and verse
[33:42] 16 and behold one came and said unto him
[33:46] good Master what good thing shall I do
[33:49] that I may have eternal life and he said
[33:52] unto him why callest thou me good there
[33:55] is none good but one and that is is God
[33:58] but if thou will enter into life keep
[34:01] the Commandments may God add His
[34:03] blessings to the reading of the word you
[34:04] can be seated tonight I want to speak on
[34:07] the
[34:09] goodness the
[34:11] justice and the Judgment of God Amen
[34:15] that's my title the goodness the justice
[34:18] and the
[34:19] Judgment of God Amen praise the
[34:23] Lord
[34:26] amen amen brother baham says it this way
[34:29] he says so now he says we want to know
[34:32] that it's all the goodness of God and as
[34:35] our gracious brother or Roberts has well
[34:37] placed it God is a good god he certainly
[34:40] is and now we know that he is a good God
[34:45] Amen but we don't want to depend on that
[34:48] too much on that remember he's a God of
[34:51] Justice too because his Holiness
[34:55] requires him Justice
[34:58] and his laws must be met amen his
[35:02] requirements must be met
[35:05] amen listen here he says we hear so much
[35:08] today about God being a good God he is
[35:13] but he's a god of wrath too he's a god
[35:16] of judgment he's a God of Justice and
[35:20] his Holiness
[35:22] requires Justice
[35:28] it behooves listen God to be just
[35:31] because he's holy he judges and condemns
[35:37] the same as He
[35:40] blesses amen wow it's kind of different
[35:44] in I've got to thinking about the
[35:47] goodness of God how many knows God is
[35:49] good and I'll I'll read one more one
[35:51] more quote here God is a good god I've
[35:54] heard that so much till I get sick God
[35:58] is also a God of Justice he ain't a
[36:00] whole Doty grandpa that can be pushed
[36:03] around and his grandkids don't have any
[36:08] sins amen grandkids sometimes for us
[36:11] Grandpa they can't do any that's okay if
[36:14] they do that Mama pick him up pick him
[36:16] up and whoop him good you're like
[36:19] a that's a doie old grandpa greaty old
[36:23] grandma ain't that right dirty old not
[36:25] dirty Doty
[36:30] amen I have to admit I'm a little bit
[36:33] that way amen a little bit too
[36:35] much amen but God's not that way is he
[36:39] no God's not that way and I want you to
[36:43] know that every good gift comes from God
[36:47] every good thing comes from God Amen and
[36:52] everything that we have everything that
[36:54] we possess amen our very life every
[36:57] breath that you
[37:00] take it's a gift of
[37:04] God Amen how many believes you God is a
[37:07] good god and that's what I want to start
[37:09] off with amen that God is a good god and
[37:14] even Jesus said when he was asked he
[37:16] said good Master what must I do he makes
[37:20] he he corrects the fellow and he says
[37:23] you know there is only one that's good
[37:31] Oh Brother Steve you're so good brother
[37:33] Tom you're so good brother Brad you're
[37:35] so good we'd say no even my wife has
[37:38] little song she beginning to write about
[37:40] you know any good that you see in me is
[37:44] him how many believes any good in any of
[37:48] us it's not you it's
[37:52] him any good that you see in any of us
[37:56] cuz if it was up to us us we'd be a
[37:58] bunch of Thieves and robers and we'd
[38:01] stab each other we'd shoot each other
[38:03] we'd be murder are you with me there
[38:07] would not be one good thing about us in
[38:09] our carnal nature we're a bunch of
[38:11] Rascals we're are lost we've got the
[38:13] wrong to Nature to begin with and we
[38:16] even we as professing Christians have a
[38:18] hard time conquering that old
[38:21] nature it still likes to rise
[38:25] up amen it takes the power of the Holy
[38:28] Ghost to suppress that thing Amen to
[38:31] keep it
[38:32] under CU it still wants to keep rising
[38:35] up but amen we think about it it would
[38:39] how many knows that we could sit here
[38:41] all night and all day tomorrow as a
[38:43] matter of fact let me just say it this
[38:44] way it'll take us all of eternity to
[38:48] praise God for his
[38:51] goodness cuz every good gift everything
[38:54] that we got our Salvation it come from
[38:56] the goodness of God
[38:58] you didn't have to die for it you didn't
[39:00] have to go on Calvary for it you didn't
[39:01] have to be beat you didn't have to have
[39:03] strip on no you got to give until you're
[39:06] afraid that's a good
[39:11] God
[39:13] Amen praise the Lord think about it amen
[39:17] the very God that brought us here the
[39:19] very God that allowed Adam and Eve to
[39:21] come here and they were there in the
[39:23] beautiful Garden of Eden enjoying the
[39:26] goodness of
[39:28] God
[39:30] Amen but what did they do but fall what
[39:33] did they do but
[39:35] sin hello how many know she just
[39:39] deviated on one word she just had one
[39:41] little sin and it caused all the whole
[39:44] fall do you realize that you when you
[39:47] sin just a little bit just one
[39:50] Disobedience of his commandment and
[39:53] you're as guilty as the was
[39:58] come on people he didn't have get put
[40:00] that on her and then not
[40:03] you that's part of the reason why he
[40:05] said don't lean too much on his goodness
[40:08] because he's also a just God he's a holy
[40:12] God his Holiness says amen requires
[40:17] judgment in other words he has certain
[40:19] laws and certain rules amen and there
[40:22] has to be Justice brought to every
[40:25] Commandment that is broken
[40:31] you can be the best preacher in the
[40:33] world you s against God and you're cut
[40:36] off right there till you
[40:39] repent you g the Holy Ghost
[40:42] away he's gone until you get that right
[40:46] there's no respector a
[40:49] persons
[40:50] amen I thought that's right he is just
[40:53] as much a god of judging and condemning
[40:56] as he is is in
[40:59] blessing
[41:02] amen praise the
[41:05] Lord listen to what he says they say oh
[41:08] he's a good God he is a good god yes but
[41:11] don't presume on that he's a God of
[41:14] Justice too he's a good god like a
[41:17] little teenage boy said not long ago
[41:19] said you know God is's so good that he
[41:21] just don't care what I
[41:23] do what do you reckon brother bam said
[41:26] I'll tell you what he said he said said
[41:31] nonsense nonsense God don't love you so
[41:34] much that he allows you to sin no he
[41:38] don't everybody listening out there
[41:41] world are you
[41:43] listening isn't it something that God
[41:46] put man and Humanity on such a basis
[41:49] amen that he has certain laws and
[41:51] certain
[41:54] responsibilities amen and he'll give an
[41:56] account for for every thing that he does
[42:00] Jesus said that a man will give an
[42:02] account for every Idol word that he
[42:05] speaks every action that we have every
[42:08] thought that go through our mind every
[42:10] word that we speak you've got to give an
[42:12] account
[42:15] for not other words our human being we
[42:18] are accountable people they can try to
[42:20] ignore it amen they can be an atheist
[42:22] but they will give an
[42:25] account you will give an account for
[42:28] every deed every action that you ever
[42:30] did that requires you God's justice and
[42:34] re judgment requires
[42:37] it because you can accept the goodness
[42:40] of
[42:43] God or you have to accept the wrath of
[42:46] God you have to there's no
[42:51] choice you either accept his
[42:54] goodness or you accept his Wrath
[42:57] oh taste and see that the Lord is
[43:03] good amen God is
[43:06] good all the
[43:08] time he puts his song of Praise In This
[43:12] Heart of
[43:14] mine now God isn't always
[43:21] good huh no not when you're bad
[43:28] no don't you tell let preachers tell you
[43:31] God will bless you it doesn't matter if
[43:33] you sin or you don't that's a
[43:37] lie he won't let you be lost but he'll
[43:39] get
[43:40] it God isn't that kind of a god
[43:43] otherwise he might as well give them a
[43:45] pass you realize that if he lets you get
[43:48] a pass he'll have to give them all a
[43:50] pass he is just God is just there's no
[43:55] Injustice in almighty God
[43:58] and it's quite something for us
[43:59] ministers to be able to declare to the
[44:01] world you will give an account the Bible
[44:03] says that God has so Vindicated himself
[44:06] alive in our day we know it's coming
[44:09] judgment is coming the white Throne
[44:11] judgment is
[44:12] coming W that even makes us Christians
[44:16] Shake right we don't want anything out
[44:19] from under the
[44:21] blood why because how many knows that we
[44:24] come into the house of God brother bam
[44:25] said that this is the house of
[44:32] judgment amen and some man's sins go
[44:35] before unto
[44:38] judgment W aren't you glad that you're
[44:41] taking care of it now while there's a tu
[44:43] of bleach amen for your sins and your
[44:46] false to drop in there's forgiveness for
[44:49] you amen some men follow after oh that's
[44:53] going to be a scary

[44:59] behind them you did this message
[45:02] Believers you did this and you that that
[45:03] you never repent of but how many know
[45:06] people will give an account on the day

[58:59] perfect long as you're repenting as you
[59:01] go he says you're perfect that's what he
[59:04] said come on people isn't that awesome
[59:08] isn't that to
[59:12] know oh my that's great to
[59:14] know amen that's why we aren't having to
[59:17] live Amen in a darkness in a dismal day
[59:20] aren't you glad that God didn't leave us
[59:22] into in in a confused Babylon
[59:26] what religion what church what Baptist
[59:28] Church Methodist Church Pentecostal
[59:30] Church Amy Church which one should I go
[59:32] to which one is right oh I just don't
[59:35] know amen and you get in the Bible and
[59:37] you interpret yourself and everything
[59:39] else and you're going to have your own
[59:41] denomination but no God comes and brings
[59:43] a prophet on the seene vindicates the
[59:46] word says quit thinking your own
[59:47] thoughts what God Said that clears it
[59:51] all up how you glad for the goodness of
[59:53] God God rich in Mercy
[59:57] Mery and quickened you and I brought us
[1:00:00] to life we who were once dead in sins
[1:00:02] and trespasses he has quit because he's
[1:00:05] Rich how many you God is rich in Mercy
[1:00:08] go back in Psalms and find out for his
[1:00:09] mercy endureth forever for his endur
[1:00:11] Mercy end forever he is such a merciful
[1:00:23] god trying to W the thought through my
[1:00:27] mind but I want to say I want to say
[1:00:32] that God is a 100,000 times more
[1:00:36] merciful than he is wrathful in
[1:00:42] judgment that's just a thought that went
[1:00:44] through my
[1:00:45] mind
[1:00:47] huh I don't know if it's true or not
[1:00:49] went through my
[1:00:54] mind he's more merciful I don't think
[1:00:57] that I don't think that thought's wrong
[1:01:00] why because remember the 490 times a day
[1:01:03] that he
[1:01:04] forgives if his judgment and his Mercy
[1:01:07] was equal he'd say well I'm going to
[1:01:08] give you one chance not three strikes
[1:01:12] I'm G take I'm gonna make it equal you
[1:01:14] get one
[1:01:15] forgiveness and then if you fail here's
[1:01:18] judgment but no how many times have we
[1:01:21] fail God is still merciful god still
[1:01:24] forgives Lous the Bible says in
[1:01:30] Mercy he only brings judgment because he
[1:01:33] has to because people will keep jumping
[1:01:36] over the barricades he blocks them in
[1:01:38] every way to stop them from going to
[1:01:40] hell he's not willing that any should
[1:01:42] perish so he tries to stop him him in
[1:01:45] every way he
[1:01:46] can if you finally make it to hell you
[1:01:49] had to fight your way
[1:01:53] there amen
[1:01:56] if you burn in hell just remember this
[1:01:59] you had to fight your way
[1:02:01] there you had to fight your conscience
[1:02:05] first of all you didn't have a preacher
[1:02:06] didn't even go to church every human
[1:02:08] being has a conscience don't you kid

[1:09:51] Lord oh my now notice
[1:09:57] look at him today let me go back up here
[1:10:00] and talk about Israel for minute right
[1:10:03] here it is now you say well God's a good
[1:10:06] God God is a good God but we hear too
[1:10:09] much of that today God is a god of wrath
[1:10:13] he's a god of
[1:10:15] judgment he was good enough to go down
[1:10:18] there and to take Israel right out of
[1:10:21] the mouth of death is that right look at
[1:10:24] what he did for Israel amen when they
[1:10:27] left there they had an absolute
[1:10:29] Pentecostal Jubilee no doubt but the
[1:10:32] whole place rang out with great songs of
[1:10:35] Amen Redemption and and deliverance and
[1:10:38] they praised God going out is that right
[1:10:42] now notice out of the mouth of death and
[1:10:44] then turned right in the wilderness and
[1:10:47] let them Rock because they wouldn't
[1:10:50] follow
[1:10:51] him ain't that right only two out of two
[1:10:54] million and he said you let them out
[1:10:56] there and he says you're going to go out
[1:10:57] there until you're all dead even Jesus
[1:10:59] speaking of them he says they're
[1:11:01] everyone total separated from God
[1:11:04] completely lost why because they thought
[1:11:07] they could do this they thought they
[1:11:08] could do that how many know we as
[1:11:09] Christians don't you transgress the laws
[1:11:11] of God and expect not to be punished for
[1:11:14] it or to have to repent for it I and get
[1:11:18] forgiveness for it
[1:11:21] amen I was kind of quiet on
[1:11:23] that oh but think about it that's right
[1:11:27] because it wouldn't follow God was a
[1:11:29] good God to pull you Pentecostals out of
[1:11:31] them organizations but you turned right
[1:11:33] back around and called and acted like
[1:11:35] your momy so now you're rotting in it oh
[1:11:40] this tap tap record's going there's a
[1:11:43] tape recording going on here it goes
[1:11:45] around the world you know I I'm not so
[1:11:47] much just speaking here he says but you
[1:11:49] rot right in it amen let me know it's
[1:11:54] the Pentecost look at where they were
[1:11:55] look at where suzu Street was at one
[1:11:57] time amen and pretty soon they got all
[1:11:59] divided and all he's coming on the White
[1:12:01] Horse and the cloud and got all of
[1:12:04] that amen when any church ever becomes a
[1:12:07] denominations you sit there and you R
[1:12:11] God ain't in
[1:12:13] it
[1:12:15] amen
[1:12:17] help judgment God the justice of God
[1:12:22] isn't God completely different than what
[1:12:24] people think
[1:12:26] wasn't that one Minister going around
[1:12:28] with some woman amen that was divorced
[1:12:30] about four or five
[1:12:31] times and he said something God loves
[1:12:34] her so much that he just forgive her for
[1:12:35] all that she's like a virgin
[1:12:41] now says that might be he had a dream
[1:12:44] wasn't it either dream or Vision that
[1:12:46] God was that
[1:12:50] way
[1:12:53] nonsense is that right
[1:12:55] you you know it didn't come from God the
[1:12:57] devil he had the devil's dream that
[1:12:59] night amen just like people think they
[1:13:03] can do anything and get away with
[1:13:06] no car about Litt
[1:13:09] DET you don't take nothing home tonight
[1:13:12] than this God cares about the dets in
[1:13:18] your he wants to walk with you he wants
[1:13:21] to walk with you evening night
[1:13:23] Tabernacle he wants to walk with every
[1:13:25] one of us every day every minute of the
[1:13:30] day he wants to bless you ain't that
[1:13:33] right how many believe we are blessed we
[1:13:35] are blessed we are blessed every day
[1:13:38] that I live when I get up in the morning

[1:13:43] rest I am
[1:13:44] blessed

[1:13:53] justice when I was studying this I

[1:13:58] fail God every time you sin you ought to
[1:14:01] be Zapped like a bug and a bug
[1:14:05] zapper the wages of sin is what death
