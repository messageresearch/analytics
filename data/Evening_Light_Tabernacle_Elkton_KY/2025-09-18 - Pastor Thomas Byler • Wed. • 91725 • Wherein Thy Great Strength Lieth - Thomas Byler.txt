We want to thank the Lord for that, that God will just continue to touch his body tonight. And also, Brother Joe was telling us in the prayer room back there that he'd been the doctor and they're making some adjustments to help him get better. But we just pray the great physician will work on Brother Joe tonight and heal his body. And amen, he has needs. And how many has a need tonight? Amen.

So, we just want to just pray for him that God will just drive him, lead him and guide him in the right direction tonight. Amen. Brother Brad, would you come and pray over these needs tonight? [Music] Just pray. Heavenly Father, what a privilege it is just to stand before you tonight, Lord, and be able to call upon a a God that we know is a miracle working God. a God that is omnipotent and you reign upon high, Father, and you're mindful of each and every need that we have and there's no need too great or too small. What may seem like a a request that would mean nothing to somebody else means everything to that person and we know that you see it that way, Father. Lord, you've heard the requests we've had tonight, Lord. And we're thankful for the testimonies that brother Caleb feeling better, brother John, sister Leah, the different ones, hie, as we had prayer for them last week, we see the results of the prayers tonight, Lord. They're feeling better and they're well, and they'll be able to come and be in the house of God and worship you and praise you tonight for what you've done. So Lord, we call upon you once again as needy people. You know, as your children, Lord, we we are needy. You heard the physical needs that are been brought before you tonight. The spiritual needs, maybe financial needs, whatever it is, we don't know, but Lord, you know. So Lord, we just commit them to you tonight, Lord, asking that you would move on the scene in a mighty way. That you would just come once again and be the be known as the great conqueror that conquers all of our diseases and sins and iniquities or whatever it is, all of our all of our hindrances, Lord. You're the you conquer them, Lord. and we we give you give them to you at this altar tonight Lord. So we ask Father this uh offering that's be taken up. We just ask Lord that you would just bless those that can give those who cannot. And may you just be in the remainder of the service be with brother Ber tonight in a special way that you just anoint his lips with the fire from the throne. Father, that he would just be able to speak what you would have laid on his heart in our ears that would be receptive to the word tonight. Lord, as we just desire to get more of you, Father, pour out more of yourself on us, Lord, in these precious uh name of Jesus Christ, we ask these things and Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The goodness of God. [Music] Let's sing that. I love you, Lord, for your mercy never fails me. All my days, I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up till I lay my head. Oh, I will see of the goodness of God. And all my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire. In darkness, you are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend. And I have lived in the goodness of God. Oh yes, Lord. And all my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. And your goodness is running after. It's running after me. Your goodness is running after me. It's running after me. With all my life I spend all everything running after, running after me. And all my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. and I will sing of the goodness of God. Amen. Don't you love him tonight? And Amen. I just appreciate him with all my heart. And Amen. We don't have a special tonight. Let's stand tonight and sing that second verse again and then sing the chorus as Brother Thomas comes tonight. And Amen. hadn't he been good to you? You know, I I thought I was driving down the road the other day and I began to think just how good brother Tommy he'd been to me. How he's watched over me my whole life. I went back as far as I could remember. And he was always there. Was I always serving him? No. Sometimes I was a million miles away, but he was always there. And you know the funny thing now I laugh because I used to try to fit in. And you know what some people told me one day? They said, "You know, you're just weird." I thought, "You know what? I am because I don't this is not me. I just couldn't fit in. I tried to drink and I thought, Lord have mercy, that stuff is nasty. How do they get pleasure out of that?" But I, you know, I thought all my life he's guided me. He protected me, brother Glenn, and he's kept his hand upon me, and I love him for it tonight. I love your voice. Well, you have led me through the fire. In darkest night, you are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend and I have lived in the goodness. Oh yes of God. Oh yes. And all my life you have been faithful. [Music] Oh good every breath that I am able I will sing of the goodness of God. Amen. Praise the Lord tonight. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Good to see everybody out tonight. And Amen. It's always good to be able to come into the house of God. Feel good. Amen. and uh see the different ones that the Lord has touched and healed. We're very thankful for. Amen. I think that'll be all for the music. Thank you'all very much. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's just bow our heads, go before the Lord in prayer and we'll just get into the word. Precious Lord and Savior, we come before you once again, Lord. And so grateful to be called your children. So grateful to be able to call you our father, Lord Jesus. And we know that you care about us, every part of us and everything about us, Lord. And we do thank you, Lord, for all that you have supplied for us and the health that you have restored, Lord Jesus, to the different ones. We thank you, Lord. And Father, we just pray that you would just be among us now tonight in a special way as we invite you to come. We know that you always come where you're invited. We ask God you'd help me just to step aside, Lord Jesus, so that you might say what you once said tonight. Do what you want done, Lord Jesus. We just ask God that your divine will would be accomplished tonight. Father, we commit this service and the thoughts, the meditation of our heart to you now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. If you will turn your Bibles and we're just going to go back to the same scripture that we read Sunday. Amen. And go a little bit further. Amen. With that. Amen. Go a little bit further with the thought. Amen. As I was studying, the thought came to me. Brother Bam said all you could take one scripture or one verse. He said that you could just take that and preach forever on it because it's all tied together. I thought, well, Lord, what do you want me to speak on as I begin to go with the scripture that I had and just the Lord begin to open things up and so, you know, because it truly does all tie together, don't it? &gt;&gt; All right. 2 Corinthians if you will. 2 Corinthians uh chapter 4. Amen. Appreciate the song service. Amen. Preach. I mean couple of one song especially that's going to be um certainly go along with what we want to speak on talking about faith. Amen. And certainly he uh has been very good to each and every one of us, hasn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. Chapter 4 of 2 Corinthians and verse 18. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Amen. So Paul telling us that we don't look at the things that are seen. Amen. So our focus, our main focus in our life is not at the things that we see. It's looking into the spirit realm. How many knows that it would have to be in a different dimension? In a different world, basically in the spirit realm it would have to be. Now turn your Bibles if you will, and we're going to go to the book of Judges. And we want to read one more scripture in the book of Judges. And we'll get our title from here. Judges 16. Judges 16 and I've got here 4-6. I think most of us understand the story of Samson quite a bit. Isn't that right? So we won't read the whole story, but we'll just read down to where we want to get our title from. Chapter 4 of 16 says, "And it came to pass afterwards that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorak, whose name was Delilah. And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, entice him, and see where in his great strength lith, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him, and we will give thee, every one of us, 1100 pieces of silver. And Delilah said unto Samson, tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lith, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee. Amen. May God add his blessings to the reading of the words. You can be seated. Amen. How many knows the rest of the story? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. We find out that finally, Amen. Finally, he gave up his secret. And when he gave up his secret, he lost his power. Amen. Brother Brandham used his message quite a few different times. Amen. And I was listening to the U message called a deceived church by the world. Amen. And he he talked and used this scripture here and he was it was a very very powerful message and I'll have a few quotes out of that tonight. Amen. And he brought it right to his own tabernacle. Amen. the Brandham tabernacle. Amen. And how that worldliness had gotten into them and how that they were losing their secret, so to speak. Amen. And my title tonight is wherein thy great strength lith. Wherein thy great strength lies. Basically, where does your great strength lay? Where do we get our power from? Amen. Where do we get our power from? And how do we keep that power? How can we go away tonight? How how many would like to be able to leave church tonight having a little bit more of an understanding how that you can have more of the power of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's the one objective that the devil has is to take what power that you do have. That's his that's his objective. Satan is like a roaring lion seeking uh roaming about seeking whom he may devour. Isn't it quite plain how that uh he they put it just plainly? He says, you know, how we may bind him and afflict him. Is that right? And we will give thee everyone so much money. Amen. And Delilah straight up asked and tell me, Amen. Where does your strength lie wherein we might afflict thee? I think it's time to quit dating the girls. Brother Tommy, I think it's time to quit dating this chick, so to speak. Ain't that right? I mean, she's trying to find out how in the world she can afflict you and make your life miserable. &gt;&gt; But no, not him. No, no, no. I'm going punch that Samson on the shoulder when we get over there. D man, what was wrong with you? Is that about what we would think? What was wrong with you, man? It was pretty obvious. It was quite obvious, but I guess he was love struck. Fell in love with this woman. It says that he loved her, right? Amen. What love won't do, I guess. Here we go. Just speak as we go. Love is blind. And he was pretty blind to what was going on. And finally when she really coaxed him, really coaxed him to hey, you know, if you really love me, you'll tell me and he pied her or whatever and told her and as a result Samson to me was an example of a backslider. Ain't that right? Who uh come back again. Amen. He come back again and in the end, Amen. ended up destroy I I put in here that he came back with a vengeance. Is that right? That's the way anybody ought to do when you backslide. When you get away from God, hello. And somehow Satan trips you up. You ought to come back with a vengeance. Say devil. Amen. I'm going to get you the best of you and I'm going to stomp you and I'm going to take my foot and I'm going to crush your head in the ground. Is that right? Kill with a vengeance. And so that's what Samson did, of course, in the end. Amen. But we want to look at the supernatural, the supernatural. Amen. The other dimension and see where we really get our strength from. Amen. And how that uh uh we know that God's the things where we get our strength from in the spiritual realm of course you know there's a Satan has also also his dimension is in the spiritual realm. How many believes that everything about the devil and everything about fighting the devil is in the other dimension. It's in the spirit realm. Amen. Because it says in 2 Corinthians 10 and uh let me see here. 2 Corinthians 10 and verse three says, "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds." &gt;&gt; How many believe that every everybody every one of us has strongholds? Amen. in our lives. What are those strongholds? This just comes to me. I didn't write this down, but one of one of those strongholds is is just two two different powers, brother Brandham said, that there was in the world. God's power and Satan's power. And every person is powered or controlled or has strength from one of those powers. &gt;&gt; Amen. And ultimately, the stronghold, the real battle comes in your soul. It's not in see, taste, feel, hear and smell. Not conscience, region, memory, imaginations and all that. That's not where the real the battle is. The real battle is where? In the soul. And that right. And that soul in that soul realm there's only two choices only two things that operates that. And that automat uh automatically uh ultimately automatically ultimately is the drive shaft of every person. All right. One of them is faith and one of them is doubt. You're either controlled by one or you're controlled by the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're pushed. You're powered by. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you think about it. How many know that in this spiritual realm, I want to talk about Satan's side for a minute. Would that be all right? You know, because we know that uh things like hatred is in the spirit realm. It's in the spirit realm. It's actually a demon. &gt;&gt; How many believes he's actually a demon? Bitterness is a demon. &gt;&gt; Hatred, jealousy, a demon. all these things and it and it brings about misery. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe demons afflict you? Demons of affliction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. How many knows that hatred is miserable? &gt;&gt; It's miserable to have hatred. It's miserable to have bitterness. Amen. And we know that that's all demons that were cast out of heaven. How many believe that the devil is not comfortable? The devil is miserable. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to know how the devil feels, just think of how you felt when you was unsaved. You was miserable. Isn't it something how that God talked about the Leodysia age and called them wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked? They were in a miserable condition. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were governed by the Satan. They had a spirit of misery and also lukewarmness. &gt;&gt; Lukewarmness or me being mediocre about things. That's also a place of misery. &gt;&gt; God wants you to be hot or he wants you to be cold. &gt;&gt; Amen. You just, oh, I'm just humrum. You're miserable is what you are. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Yeah. You're either hot or you're cold. &gt;&gt; You either got the power of God in your heart or you don't. You either got the light in there or you don't. And if you got the power of God in your life, the devil don't like happy people. &gt;&gt; The devil don't like anybody that's got the real power of God in their life. They He wants to find your power. I believe it's the prophet of God said, you know, the devil has studied humanity. He studies you just to find out where your weakness is, how he can get to you. He is very exuberant about trying to make you miserable with him. Because misery loves company. &gt;&gt; Why do you think those miserable people that don't a man have to go to the bars and drink and man they go up there and they have a Budweiser and they tell their buddy about all their hardships and the oh my all that you know there and they have they become buddies. Why? Because they're partners of misery. &gt;&gt; Birds of a feather flock together. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but you know it it's we we just don't like to hear a whole lot of negativity, do we? &gt;&gt; No. A really believer doesn't want to hear a whole lot of negativity. Why? Cuz we try to say good things and be positive even if we are a little miserable. &gt;&gt; Stay positive about the whole thing. But all of those things like bitterness, those are in the spiritual realm, hatred, spiritual realm and murder in the spiritual realm. and Satan and I just read in the news and I don't know you know when you say you read in the news or heard in the news you always put your ear up but they said that the parents of this what's his name Tyler the guy that killed Charles Charlie K that he had just turned in that direction and within the last year amen that he had actually turned I thought man within a year that guy could keep pick up that kind of a spirit of hatred because how many knows he hated him conservatives. He hated Charlie. He hated what he said and he got political and got caught up all up in that. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And before you knew it, he had that evil spirit. And how many knows that murder is a spirit? &gt;&gt; That's right. You've got to have some kind of a mean devil on you to actually kill somebody. You've got to absolutely have a devil on you to pull that trigger. And in just in that short span of time, the devil so captivated him. &gt;&gt; Hello. Until he actually killed somebody. Now where he's at. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Satan. That's the power of Satan. &gt;&gt; How much better he had have been if he' just stay out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. So there's no there's no comfort in that. Amen. No comfort in the left. No comfort in Amen. in being in that type of a situation where you have hatred and bitterness in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Unforgiveness. So what do we got to do? We got to be sober. We got to be vigilant because our adversary, the devil, goeth about seeking whom he may devour. He's not happy. He's not happy with a church that's on fire. &gt;&gt; He's not happy with y'all clapping your hands and being on fire for God. He's not. No, he's going to work on you out there. &gt;&gt; That's right. He's going to work. He's going to try. He wants to find out where your strength lies &gt;&gt; and he wants to take th that strength from you. As a prophet of God, I think preach a message on where has thy strength gone, Samson? Where's it gone? Where is he at? Why? He was robbed of the devil. Amen. My my my praise the Lord. No. And so we want to look at the just a few things some of the things that where our strength lays and we have to guard that. We want to see it some of the things some of the ways that the devil amen can take our strength from us. Amen. The first thing is of course found I believe in Galatians. I don't know if I even put this down here. It's not Epha not Galatians. It's Ephesians 2. Amen. Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace are you saved through faith." &gt;&gt; First, I want wanted to put in here that the one of our main weapons, our strength lays in faith in God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said, "Any man that's ever made a show at all in life has been men who has trusted God and took him at his word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man that doesn't take him at his word never mounts to a hill of beans. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. We've had George Washington's Abraham Lincoln. What more? We've had Amen. Just ask uh Stonewall Jackson, why does it make why can you still stand there and have bullets and arrows whizzing by you? Isn't that right? He said, "I never take a drink of water, but I thank my master for it." &gt;&gt; He had a relationship with God. He did not fear death. He must have known the master &gt;&gt; and he had faith in God. So that's why Stonewall Jackson resounds even today. &gt;&gt; Why? because of his bravery. &gt;&gt; Because he was a man that believed in God. George Washington crossing to Delaware, praying all night before going. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Praying, talking to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So any of you young people want to amount to a hill of beans, if you want to believe amount to anything, don't believe in this blue hair and this orange hair &gt;&gt; in these modern ways. It ain't going to get you nowhere. &gt;&gt; No, it brings you in depression and everything else. Believe in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. I got to step back just one step back before that and and that is it's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our power is the grace of God &gt;&gt; because we're saved by what? Grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. But through the instrumentality of faith. And I like the next verse because it says here, amen. He says, "Save through faith and that not of yourself. It is a gift of God." [Applause] How many's glad that God give you that gift? Because it's not something you do yourself, but it's God's faith in you. &gt;&gt; That's what gives you power. That's where your power lays. Yes. &gt;&gt; First John 4:54 says, "And whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world." And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Did Brother Bam say faith, man, it beats down. It don't apologize to the devil. It's unapologetic. It beats the devil down. It conquers. It throws in prison. &gt;&gt; It takes control of the situation. That's what faith is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. How many's glad for faith? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're living by faith. &gt;&gt; We're living by faith, folks. Amen. We need plenty of it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Ask David. David, where does your strength lie? Is it in your size? Is it in your biceps? Is it in your skill to throw a stone. No. When he come up there and that giant challenged him, I don't come to you in the she with a shield and a sword. I come to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Isn't that right? This the master. Amen. The Lord of hosts. That's who I come. And that's who he knew. That was his secret. And that Goliath come on down. Hebrews 11:1 says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." So how many know that brother may went into great detail about this, but he says faith is actually a substance. &gt;&gt; I am glad that it's just not my thought in my brain. Faith is not just your thought in your brains, but it's a revelation that God has placed in there that the gates of hell themselves cannot prevail against. &gt;&gt; Woo! What a powerful weapon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. I like that. the substance. I was thinking, you know, there Israel was cowered down and they were hoping somehow that they could overcome that giant. Man, we're in our foxholes. Why? We hope to overcome this thing. We hope to overcome this thing. They were in uh Egypt. Boy, I sure hope one of these days God delivers us. I sure hope. I sure hope. But guess what? When faith come along, it was the substance of things hoped for. And I'm here to tell you, if you have a need tonight, whatever it is, you might be hoping for, but let faith come and it'll be the substance of the things that you've hoped for to bring it to a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. When David went out there with that sling and that stone, I don't care how many doubters there was, he was going out there by faith. He had the substance of faith and he brought that giant down. What they had hoped for was manifested in faith in in uh David. Amen. Faith is the substance of things hoped for. &gt;&gt; In other words, Amen. For if you're hoping for something, you need more than hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith will make that hope happen. Praise the Lord. How many's glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to ask Shamgar, what's the secret, Shamgar? How many knows what's what was Shamgar's secret? Faith. And also something else, a little bit of righteous indignation. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? His indignation rose up and he said, "I am a son of God. I'm a child. I'm an Israelite. I'm a circumcised. These uncircumcised Philistines, they're coming and taking me and robbing me all the time. I'm here to tell you sometimes you sometimes the devil God will allow you just to get so miserable until you're chicken tired of being miserable and you get up on your feet and have some faith in God and go and conquer that thing. &gt;&gt; But we're too lukewarm. Well, I guess that's just how it's going to be. I've heard brother Bam say you might come up in the line say well I'll go see if I get healed. &gt;&gt; He says no way. You're not getting it that way. &gt;&gt; You got to have a little more about you than that. A little more perseverance. You got to have a little more faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. More like I'm going up there and I'm not coming back until I got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My my my Praise the Lord. Listen to that. It says, "By faith, the elders obtained a good report." &gt;&gt; That's where you could see Brother Bram saying, "Nobody's ever really amounted to anything unless they've had been people who believed in God." &gt;&gt; Amen. Did great things. Believed in God. Ask Moses, "Moses, where does your strength lie? Are you a eloquent speaker? Huh? &gt;&gt; Sure. He was Can you imagine? Moses was an educated man. He taught the Egyptians and stuff. Isn't that right? He was smart, but he did have a speech impediment, I guess. And he tell God, "Can't you get somebody else? I can't talk." Right. I don't know if he stuttered or what, but he wasn't in that. No, it was on his in his experience at the burning bush. He had a revelation. He had faith. By faith, Moses, Amen, went down there and said, "God said, let my people go." &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? He got it out. He said it. And he had he better done it, too. Or he was in a lot of trouble. Was it in Moses? Was Moses going on his own? No. He'd have went the other way. He'd have ran from it. &gt;&gt; He didn't even want to do it. But when faith struck, it was a different story. That's where his strength laid was in faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Substance. Praise the Lord. Can you imagine? Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of not things, things not seen. Moses come down there with faith and they may have hoped for 400 years to be released but by faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; God used no uh Moses and he pulled them all out of there. &gt;&gt; How many is glad for faith? &gt;&gt; Amen. Very glad for faith. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. But the devil doesn't like that. The devil doesn't like for us to stay on fire. He likes for us to try to uh he tries to try to get us strip us of our power, strip us of our glory, strip us of everything that God gives us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. We know that Donna has sang the song before. Faith is the key. to to the door. Amen. Faith is the key that opens the door. Faith is the key to the blessings of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; It unlocks. And who is the door? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believes Jesus is the door? &gt;&gt; When you come into the door of Jesus, &gt;&gt; Amen. Come into Christ because there are no other door. that gives you access. By faith, we have access. Amen. And then the Holy Spirit comes, &gt;&gt; makes his abode in you. &gt;&gt; And then everything you have need of is in you. Then &gt;&gt; let me ask you, how does it feel? &gt;&gt; Got one. Great. &gt;&gt; How's it feel? Amen. &gt;&gt; To know that you got everything that you ever have need of in your heart. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just for this journey, brother Brad, but for the world that is to come. &gt;&gt; You've got what you'll need at death's door if you was to go there and sickness door. Amen. It don't matter. He's supplied everything. Amen. And we like to let the devil know that he's not stripping us of our power like he did Samson. &gt;&gt; You're not going to take that from me. &gt;&gt; No. But the church world, Pentecostal world, they were losing their power. &gt;&gt; How many knows that? &gt;&gt; Oh, he really railed on him. This is what he said. He says, "Where is our power? Where's our glory? What is it?" It's because we've went after the wisdom man instead of the power of God. Our preachers and things are so stiff and starchy till they've organized us. We're so starchy and stiff necked till people you never hear shout in the church anymore. You never hear anybody cry anymore. Where is your power gone? Where is the cry for God gone? &gt;&gt; Where is it at? Woo. Where's that power gone? Once he was stripped of it. My praise the Lord. Never hear anybody cry. He said the mourner's bench is put in the basement. There's no more glory in the church. Amen. Satan has stripped the church of enthusiasm. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he says, "We're stiff as can be. We're not free. He said, "We're bound." The devil with his modernistic demons has bound the church of the living God. There's no power in the church. There's no freedom. The people are so starchy and stiff. Why? God can come down in the midst of Pentecostal people and show that he's God and prove his signs and his resurrection, it don't even shake them. Glory. Why? It's a disgrace. I walk across the country, God working, performing signs, and people sitting, well, I guess that's all right. I know it can be done. It doesn't move them. Why? They're bound by Delilah or the world. Hello. How many know better says, man, it used to be that the word of God fed people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Another one. Samson the Philistines is on thee. random tabernacle worldlyism is creeping in among you. What about it? Have you exposed your secret? Have you exposed that secret that God gave you when you were wallering in the sawdust a few years ago? Let me say this. Have you lost that dedication, that commitment to God, that zeal for God? Hello. Don't let the devil steal that from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That How many believe that prayer life? I mean, there's power in prayer. &gt;&gt; That's right. And not and not just when you're uh h praying in the church and everybody hears you and so forth. No, but when you're at home, when you go to your closet, your wife don't even hear you, your children don't even hear you, you have a fellowship with Almighty God. That's where your strength lays. &gt;&gt; The devil wants to make you so busy until you ain't got time to pray. ain't got time to meditate. God, the devil has robbed us. We've given him the secret of our time. We haven't got no time anymore to meditate. We've given him too much of our mind. &gt;&gt; What is it brother said? If you want to get closer to God, here's told you earlier. You want to go with more power closer to God. It's the same story again. I'm telling you again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of the sinner. Ain't that right? Nor siteth in the seat of the scornful, but his delight is in the law of the Lord. And oh, and he has law. Does he meditate once in a while? No. But we're so busy thinking about our worldly stuff. That's what the problem is, &gt;&gt; man. I was thinking the other day, Brother Bad, I would hate to be an Amish person. I'd hate to be a denominational preacher. Cuz those Amish people, they can't get no fresh revelation. &gt;&gt; They don't know what a fresh revelation is. Those preachers don't know what a fresh revelation is. It's always the same old story. Same old story. Same old story. Hello. I like to have some fresh stuff. I say, "God, help me. Help me. Give me some fresh stuff so I can give the people some fresh stuff." Amen. This fountain is a overflowing, a river of life bubbling up. It's inexhaustible. There's no end. Amen. We're going to have fresh stuff all the way till we get out of here, folks. You don't hear no more screaming anymore. &gt;&gt; Time to let go, folks. He says, "They're bound. They're stiff." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. That's right. Have you let it creep out with social formal worship? How many know that sometimes you just come to church, it's just a Wednesday tonight? You know, it's just going to be a Wednesday night. No, &gt;&gt; no, that's just formal. I come here to worship God. I come here to praise God. I come here to preach the unadulterated truth. I didn't just come here for another servant. I come here to give God glory to his name. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you I don't remember. I don't remember even in Dixon, brother. We had some good service. We had a few outbreaks, but I believe that we're getting into a different &gt;&gt; time zone. &gt;&gt; I believe we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that you don't got to go to Virginia. You don't got to go to Louisiana &gt;&gt; or Vancouver &gt;&gt; or anywhere else to have good services. No. &gt;&gt; Nope. You ain't got to wait till some maybe maybe sometime. No. We can have it if we'll just not let the devil rob us of our power. &gt;&gt; Not let the devil rob us of our thought pattern. Amen. Occupy our mind with the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Starting meditating him on Wednesday. Amen. Day and night. He'll pour out revelation. We'll have a greater service. The things of the world won't mean nothing to you anymore. church will mean more to you. The word of God will mean more to you. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. &gt;&gt; Rob does of our time, our secret prayer life. &gt;&gt; Amen. A meditation. &gt;&gt; Remember Joshua, the same one. Write it upon the post of your door. Think about it day and night. &gt;&gt; Amen. Day and night. Keep the Lord. Paul, David said, "Oh, David, the album asked David, David, where does your strength lie?" I'll tell you where my strength lies. Amen. Every time I didn't have to look for a bear or a or a lion in my sheep herd, I was meditating on God. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He had a meditation. He knew what meditation did. &gt;&gt; Concentration. Meditation. That's where your power lies. &gt;&gt; Your prayer. &gt;&gt; Read your Bible more. Think about him more. Meditate on him more. You want more of God if you don't do those things. You want somebody to come and wave a magic wand over you? More of the power of God to you. &gt;&gt; Not how it works. No, it works when you get to your closet. Amen. And you go to talking about the Lord a little more. Say, "Reveal yourself to me more. I need revelation more than anything else." It gives me power. It brings me joy. God, help us to tap into that unseen force, into that unseen world, and let's see some of that stuff come over here. &gt;&gt; Give me some of that peace of joy. Amen. That makes you run around to church screaming and hollering say, "Man, I just feel good." &gt;&gt; What's that stuff that you're taking? I'm taking a little bit of that Holy Ghost stuff. &gt;&gt; And it feels good. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can see brother Bham running around here right now. Can you? &gt;&gt; I believe he'd reprove. &gt;&gt; He didn't like that old stiff starchy stuff too much. Them icicles hanging from the chandeliers going into a church he said and it's 10 below zero. Some woman go everybody shimmer spine. No, just join in. Yeah, just join in. This is the hour that we worship God more than we ever had. We're getting ready. I believe this was saying a while ago. I believe that we're getting ready for the other side. &gt;&gt; Oh, can I just say what comes mind? I can't help but think that that dimension is getting closer to us and we're going to get closer to that dimension and one of these days we're going to take a body change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We'll speed up and they'll slow down &gt;&gt; and we'll meet each other. Amen. Well, I wasn't expect that tonight, brother. I wouldn't either. &gt;&gt; But let go. &gt;&gt; Let go and let God have his way. used to when the preaching of the word went forth. The old saints with tears in their eyes would raise to their feet and walk around, walk sobbing, maybe not saying a word, just walking around two or three times and sit down so filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The word fedom. &gt;&gt; Are you being fed tonight? It's the word fatim. &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word &gt;&gt; that proves teed is out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Philistines are on thee. Brandom tabernacle. Philistines are on you Pentecostals. Of course, the Philistines got the rest of you. Ain't that right? That's right. Philistines got the rest of them already. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I wrote down here, I wonder what it would be like to have all prayer and all night prayer. Where's all night prayer meetings? Get my phone, would you, brother? I thought, you know, if I felt like I do when I pray half the time, I wouldn't last all night. I wouldn't feel like praying all night. It would be a chore. &gt;&gt; Huh? And I just happen to believe that if you go into that realm, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; that it shouldn't be a chore. &gt;&gt; No, it's kind of like a good church service. It's before you know, Amen. Hours have passed. &gt;&gt; Is that right? We've sat there and boy, you mean to tell me it's been two hours already. What would it be like for us to stay here till 12:00 like Paul and them did and preach all night, &gt;&gt; pray all night? Can you imagine what kind of power you'd have? Everybody ask you, man, what church do you go to? What do you believe? What makes you so sweet, so kind, so gentle, so loving, so meek? Man, you're such a nice person. Hello. I say, I'll tell you why. Because I've got faith in God. Why are you so kind? Cuz I got faith in God. What makes your sister dress right? Amen. In skirts and not cutting your hair. Cuz I got God. I believe in God. &gt;&gt; I have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was listening to a tape and I he says it this way. all things. Now, sincerely, sincerity, we don't have it. It seems to be such a small interest. It should be in a time of this jubilee right now after we know and are positive of these things. It should be that Shreveport would be buzzing like a buzz saw. The jail ought to be full of Christians. I put that Christians there because that's who he's talking about. Hanging out the windows preaching the gospel. Hello. The street corners ought to be full of men and women testifying of the power of God. 1962. We've lost our sincerity. We've lost that and the enthusiasm that it is to receive it. That's the truth. That's exactly right. Amen. Listen, we've lost our sincerity and enthusiasm to receive it. We will we'll never come back until we come down to that spot of appreciation of God making a way for us. How many believes that? And then calling us in it and vindicating it to us by the spirit and by his word, the assurance of it. Amen. Praise the Lord. Did I read you this whole thing? Yes, I did. But I was thinking, you know, Lord, help me. What would it be like if a lot of us went home tonight &gt;&gt; and you didn't go to bed till 3:00 in the morning &gt;&gt; because you got to praying &gt;&gt; and praying and getting caught up in that spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have 100% confidence the next day you wouldn't be all groggy. &gt;&gt; The Lord would give you strength. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Where is our all where's our meetings? Where is our street corner preaching? He says the street corners ought to be full of people testifying of the power of God. And folks, when I think about a lack of testifying and going and witnessing and doing what you know after what God has done, &gt;&gt; I mean, we've got we've got it people. We've got what we can say. Look, this is it, folks. God vindicated this. This is proven. You know, listen to it. If you can't believe it, listen to it. &gt;&gt; Play them the tape. &gt;&gt; I listen to you, brother. preacher or preaching here uh uh yesterday and he says, "I heard about a couple of people that were listening to the tapes. They were listening a couple messages." He says, "And they said they got saved." &gt;&gt; That's right. You can get saved listening to the messages. &gt;&gt; It's got that kind of power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. What did brother Ram say? He says the only power we got anymore, Amen. is and the only fire we have the world that is. I don't believe it's in our message main message ranks. I am I don't go evangelize, but I'm sure that you can go to some churches and you have a you've got a have a big old pry bar. Pry bar to get a amen out of folks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah out of folks. Hello. &gt;&gt; Some people are stiff and starchy is what brother Bam said. &gt;&gt; But God help us not to be that way. &gt;&gt; Lord, wake them up. Lord, help me wake up. &gt;&gt; Amen. realize, hey, this thing is something that we need to give our all to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me uh before coming to my closing statement, I want to say one more thing. One more thing that chokes chokes Amen. and takes takes out the power out of our lives. And it's so simple. So simple, but it's the cares of life. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; The need to make ends meet. We need to make ends meet. You got to work for it. &gt;&gt; Hello. But sometimes we spend so much time, more time than what we should &gt;&gt; to try to make ends meet. &gt;&gt; It that's just the cares of life. There's two scriptures I had. One was in Luke 8 and 14. And that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of life. the cares, the riches and pleasures can take the power of God out of your life. &gt;&gt; How many knows we got to be careful that that doesn't become more important to us &gt;&gt; than God &gt;&gt; reading prayer churchmen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it has a tendency to take out the real power of God out of your life. One more scripture and then I want final quote and we'll close. 21 chapter of Luke, he says about the fig tree and all the trees when they go shoot forth. Ye see and know that of your own selves that summer is nigh at hand. So likewise ye when she shall see all these come to pass. Know that the kingdom of God is not at hand. Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. Now notice when he says when you get down to where this is where we are, isn't it? The fig tree putting forth his beds. This generation shall not pass. When he gets done with all of that, here is his warning. And take heed to yourself, least at any times your hearts be overcharged with surfetting. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I pulled that up about surfing. It said something about an excessive amount of something. an excessive amount of something. Amen. And drunkenness and cares of this life. So that that day come upon you unaware. So that was God. That was Jesus's own warning that you don't be overcharged with the cares of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; What does that have to do with where our minds are? &gt;&gt; Where our goals are. Amen. that it doesn't become more because because listen to what he says so that that take that day come upon you unawares for as a snare. Isn't it something that I think in other scriptures says as a thief in the night but here it says as a snare. What's a snare? Well, from what I understand, it's them snares that you put out in the field and right and something comes up and they don't see that wire, but all of a sudden they're in it and they can't get out of it and they're stuck. &gt;&gt; How many know that's what the tribulation's going to be? They're in it. They're stuck. They can't get out of it. They missed the rapture &gt;&gt; as a snare. It will come upon all them that dwell upon the earth. Amen. So don't be letting the cares of this life, riches, cares, pleasures, whatever it is, &gt;&gt; keep your focus on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Between now and Sunday, don't do the same thing you did between last Sunday &gt;&gt; and tonight. &gt;&gt; If you're not where you ought to be with God and you need more of God, Amen. Make more time to meditate on him. Make more time to pray because the devil knows if you're too busy to think about God and his word, it'll be it won't be long. And y'all know what I'm talking about before you're like, "Boy, I haven't really thought about God for a while." And you know, and and God and the church just doesn't mean as much as to me as it should. That's &gt;&gt; right. Is that right? How many knows it's easy for that to happen? &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so busy in this. This is Wednesday, but I really want to get this done. &gt;&gt; Huh? This is Sunday. I really want to get this uh you know, I I I I can't go. Watch those words. I can't go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we love to have church, don't we? &gt;&gt; Now, listen to this. Brother Brandham, after scolding the Pentecostals and say, "Man, it's gotten to where if somebody screams, everybody turns their head like a goose and everything else and really chopping them." and also his own church preaching at his own church talking about uh uh watch out the Philistines are upon you. Amen. How many could say or should I say by the spirit speaking amen watch out lay out is on you. &gt;&gt; How many is after you? It wants you to make you lukewarm. It wants you to get backslid. It wants you miserable, wretched, poor like it is. Amen. Now, there's here's the only hope that I have this morning at the end of that message to wind up the message is this. While Samson was bound, a new shock of hair growed out. Amen. Amen. We might say while people around the message that are dying and falling away, getting lukewarm, hello, &gt;&gt; there's a new shock of hair growing on. God sends us another church just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her in the denomin oh my in the denominations of the spirit he says in the demonstrations of the spirit and Mark 16 can follow that church Acts 2:4 Acts 2:38 I will be following right along with that church signs and wonders accompanying the apostles great signs of his resurrection ction accompany on them. While we're in prison, surely God's growing a crop somewhere for the last great kill. That's right, brother Mam. You said it. We're here. Yes. Is the crop that is you talked about. Signs and wonders following the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; A church that's got the power in it. A church that's got the glory in it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Can I just say what comes to mind? &gt;&gt; Our women have long hair. &gt;&gt; That is her glory. &gt;&gt; It's a glory for women to have long hair. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. I thought I was going to quit. But what's happened? &gt;&gt; What happened to the church? Brother BCified preachers. &gt;&gt; Amen. That ain't got no backbone anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wanted to say in the spirit to the church world out there, sisters, where has your hair gone? Where's your power gone? It's your power. It's your Nazerite now. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Oh my. I'll tell you where it's gone. It left when the preacher got up there and said, "It don't really matter." That's where it went. What's the problem today in the Pentecost world? They're wearing pant now. They're not wearing skirts anymore. &gt;&gt; Hello. And not only that, it's worse yet. Guess what? The woman is up here preaching. &gt;&gt; She done got the man sat down. She done got the preacher sitting in the pews and she's up here telling them what to do. Isn't that the pathetic? &gt;&gt; Why? Because they drifted away. Because they let Delilah woo them. &gt;&gt; How many would say, "I'm not going to let Delilah &gt;&gt; woo me." &gt;&gt; That's right. The things of the world is not going to entice me. &gt;&gt; No. Uh-uh. Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; It starts right up here, Brother Brad. &gt;&gt; Starts with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'm glad that I ain't got to preach to that balcony up there. Huh? I thank God that people love to hear the truth. &gt;&gt; People come to church to hear the truth. Y'all love the truth. That's where you come. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that there's a group of people that God's got that loves his word &gt;&gt; that won't let Elida, don't let the world, don't let the pleasures of life, don't let any of that rob you &gt;&gt; of your power. &gt;&gt; Listen, it's not about this is what it's about. It's about every one of us as an individual having our morning prayer, our noon prayer, our all day prayer, praying always, having a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. a relationship that in the spiritual realm I come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses. Ain't that right? Amen. And he walks with me and he talks with me. Amen. He tells me that I am his own. When we come forth from that garden, we're sweet. We're tender. We're meek. We're loving. People can tell when you've been praying. They can tell when you've been meditating on the Lord. You're dedicated to God. That's what it's all about. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Stand. Amen. That is my message tonight. I feel the Lord's laid on my heart to speak. Amen. Beware. Beware. Ain't that right? Don't let Delilah rob you. Don't let the devil steal your secret, &gt;&gt; your faith, your prayer life. Amen. Your meditation of your heart. Of course, that's just a couple things, but that's one of the main lines right there. Faith in God. Amen. That'll give you power over the enemy. Keep that faith. Amen. God bless you. Let's have a word of prayer. Thank the Lord for coming. How many believe he came in a special way? &gt;&gt; Amen. He really did. You know, &gt;&gt; he really did. And I I just thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank him that he promised he would never leave us nor forsake us even to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; He's going to have a crop. How many believe there's going to be a crop from this seed that's been planted? And you and I are part of that crop. &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be part of that crop. I could jump over this pulpit and do a double flip and land on my feet &gt;&gt; only in my mind. But I done did it. Hello. That's how glad I am. Amen. To be a part of the crop of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Let's just raise our hands. Precious Lord and Savior, we want to thank you God for what you have done for sending down in our hearts that grace, amazing grace. How sweet this sound that saved a wretch like us, Lord. That give us the faith, Lord, to access this grace, Lord Jesus. You even give that to us, to have that faith, to receive that faith to believe in you, Lord. We could be like that Tyler who had let the devil take a hold of him and take hatred in his life and put murder in his life and cause him to go many miles just to shoot somebody. What a horrible devil. What a horrible miserable devil that he has had to have in his heart. God, I pray for him. I pray for mercy for him, Lord Jesus. And I ask tonight, Father, as we give you honor and glory and praise, Lord, for what you have done in our lives, Lord, help us, God, to go tomorrow, may every saint of Evening Night Tabernacle tomorrow be a stronger Christian than what they are today. May they call out the things that are causing them, Lord, to choke. The cares that are causing them to choke. those listening, streaming, if there's something in their life that's choking them, it's choking them. Lord, I pray God, let them cast that aside and say, "Devil, you're not going to bind me with this bind. No, I'm going to cut free from this thing that binds me and that keeps me from the power of God. Keep the love of God out of my life, causes me to become formal, cold, starchy, different." God, forgive me, Lord Jesus. Well, we have been starchy. where we have been stiff, Lord, and where we have gotten backslid. We ask God that you just bless each and every one now, Lord, and help us to reassign, reassess, Lord, our timeline, our calendar, Lord, and to redeem the time, Father, and bring it back to you, Lord, so we'd have more time for you, God. I thank you, Lord Jesus, that I was able, Lord, today just to take the whole day off, Lord, and just a massive meditate upon you, to rest and meditate and ask you, God. And I knew I had prayer warriors praying for me, Lord, when I sat down at that desk, Lord. And I begin to pray. So Lord, now bring it, Lord. Lord, and you did within a few minutes, Lord. And I thank God for a group of people, Lord, that prays and you, Father, you answer our prayer. Then you come here in a special way, Lord, and do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, Lord. Now, Lord, as we raise our hands to you and say, I surrender all to you, Lord, Father, so that you might use me, Father. Just use us Lord for your kingdom for your glory. Bless every young person Lord. May they rededicate themselves to you Lord to prayer to Lord listening to your voice to communion with you in prayer Lord and may you speak to their hearts and may they become Lord real pillars Father that can never be moved. Amen. So that they could sing that song I shall not be I shall not be moved. Amen. Just like a tree that's planted by the waters. We want young people to get stable, have a revelation, God, that'll hold them all through their life like you have done from my life, Lord Jesus, from the time of 20 to now, God, may they have that same experience of the new birth and a relationship with you. Each one in here, God, and those listening, Father, I pray, bring strength to your church again. Bring power to your church again, Lord, like never before. as we get ready to leave this place in Jesus name we pray. Amen and amen. God bless you church. We love y'all. Walks with me and he talks with me. Bless you buddy. Love you. Bless me. I am his own. And the joy we share as we tear their non has ever known. He speaks and the sound of his voice.
