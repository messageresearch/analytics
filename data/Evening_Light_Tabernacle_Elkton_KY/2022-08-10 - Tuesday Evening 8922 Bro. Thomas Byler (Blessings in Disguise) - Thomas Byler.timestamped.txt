[22:51] amen thank you musicians praise the Lord
[22:54] and uh let me see
[22:58] Grace is there any way that you can zoom
[23:00] in with that camera
[23:03] I'm going to need it here in a little
[23:04] bit okay
[23:06] but I
[23:07] um just wanted to give the church a
[23:09] little report if that's okay Amen on two
[23:13] issues
[23:14] and one of them is my health amen not so
[23:18] long ago I guess about a week or so ago
[23:20] the devil brought me a box of
[23:22] rattlesnakes amen
[23:24] and so that box of rattlesnakes is high
[23:28] sugar
[23:29] and I'll tell you
[23:31] um I'm just thankful the Lord that I
[23:33] found out what it was
[23:34] and no brother Steve Langley I think
[23:36] when was it brother Steve last Wednesday
[23:39] last Wednesday but if Steve after I told
[23:41] him that I was having a hard time seeing
[23:43] way off
[23:44] easier to see close but not as easy far
[23:47] off
[23:48] amen he says you know you need to go get
[23:51] your blood sugar checked you know and
[23:52] and I ain't never worried about my blood
[23:55] sugar at all
[23:56] and uh so anyway I once before brother
[24:00] Steve had given me advice I didn't take
[24:02] it and while I was sorry I didn't so I
[24:05] appreciate brother Steve's advice and uh
[24:07] but anyway I uh went and then I got me a
[24:10] tester you know and and I was feeling a
[24:13] little bit better you know doing a
[24:14] little better than what I had been and I
[24:17] tested it and I don't know how far it
[24:19] didn't go 500 did it go with them those
[24:21] testers against him little electric ones
[24:22] used to pinch blood and the second time
[24:25] was four
[24:27] 80 or 90 something like that
[24:30] and what brother Dave what what numbers
[24:33] are coma numbers
[24:36] okay
[24:37] well anyway the first time I tested this
[24:41] is after I'm doing quite a bit better
[24:42] okay
[24:43] well anyway the first time I tested this
[24:47] is after I'm doing quite a bit better
[24:48] all right it it it didn't even say
[24:50] anything he said it uh it said hi that's
[24:54] all it said
[24:55] said hi so I was like well that don't
[24:58] tell me much other than that I want a
[25:01] number and it was the second time that I
[25:02] checked that it was 470 or something so
[25:04] anyway and I believe it was during this
[25:07] time that I've had this covet and even a
[25:09] little before maybe I you know I'd have
[25:11] to go to the bathroom a lot and when I
[25:14] got sick uh you know with the covet and
[25:17] all I would get thirsty and of course
[25:19] I'd be using the bathroom almost every
[25:21] hour of the night and I was like man
[25:22] what is all this you know and so this
[25:25] must be the covert stuff you know but
[25:27] anyway I'd get cottonmouth like crazy
[25:30] I'd get thirsty and I'd go get apple
[25:33] juice and pure grape juice and get me
[25:36] some orange juice and I drank up 25 30
[25:39] worth one time and did it twice went up
[25:42] to the Food Giant and did it again you
[25:44] know
[25:45] uh but I'd go outside sometimes looking
[25:48] and it was just like man this is bad
[25:52] it's just terrible you know and I
[25:54] thought it was covered right amen even
[25:56] two Sundays here ago when I preached on
[25:59] uh I preached a couple I think it was
[26:01] last the other Sundays I was up here and
[26:03] y'all were blurry yeah honestly you were
[26:06] blurry and you know remember when I got
[26:08] the flashing a little bit you know I had
[26:11] to make myself stop I was getting silly
[26:13] my wife
[26:14] silly but anyway I realized that it had
[26:16] to be way up there over 500 I don't know
[26:19] where in the world it was but when you
[26:21] drink a gallon a half a gallon of orange
[26:23] juice on the way I saw I'll quench this
[26:25] earth right well anyway it's a miracle I
[26:29] didn't kill myself right I said I would
[26:32] I had to be next to a coma many times
[26:34] for many days to be honest with me I'm
[26:36] different times I'd say how in the world
[26:38] am I going to preach like this you know
[26:40] this just keeps going on and on and on
[26:42] and carrying on that's why I was out for
[26:43] so long
[26:44] tried to get as many ministers in and
[26:46] everything I could you know but anyway
[26:48] so that's where it's at and uh like I I
[26:52] think I told my wife I said the other
[26:54] day I said honey I'm really eating right
[26:56] now for the first time in my life
[27:00] but anyway because I am you're all gonna
[27:04] eat all the wrong food and everything
[27:05] but anyway so uh I love to drink apple
[27:09] juice and orange juice you know I've
[27:11] drank a lot of it and now vinegar you
[27:14] know
[27:15] um a couple things that we need to make
[27:18] sure everything's all right but anyway
[27:19] so you have to watch it but anyway so
[27:22] just pray for me amen and so the first
[27:24] thing I wanted to say while you've got
[27:25] diabetes you know not what you think
[27:29] that's what you want to tell yourself I
[27:30] got diabetes
[27:32] that might even told Caleb I might have
[27:35] it or whatever you know and so and he
[27:36] said he'd rebuked me he says Dad don't
[27:38] you accept that dollar right about uh
[27:41] box of rattlesnakes
[27:44] amen and I said that's right son I'm
[27:46] sorry for saying that because I don't
[27:47] want to say
[27:48] that I don't want to say it
[27:50] you know because the second you say I've
[27:53] got that you just signed
[27:56] let me know that you just signed you
[27:58] said you had it you accepted it
[28:00] amen so I always say I have blood that's
[28:03] sugar that's a lot that I'm fighting
[28:04] with that's what I'm fighting well I
[28:06] pleasure nothing Valor can't take care
[28:08] of right amen and that's that's what I
[28:11] will say in forever amen I'd be like
[28:14] John Ryan I don't care how long it takes
[28:16] I'm here praise the Lord keep on going
[28:19] and so anyway it was up from 470
[28:22] Saturday I think last Saturday
[28:25] and uh
[28:27] then it dropped down to 325 or three
[28:29] somewhere 350 somewhere in there and I
[28:32] said well if it ain't better by Monday
[28:34] I'll go to the dock you know
[28:37] and so anyway
[28:39] Monday come along and it was around 250
[28:42] 225 at a time you know jump back up to
[28:44] 350 something that says and Caleb and
[28:47] them's a better go into this so uh
[28:49] anyway but I didn't go back went yet
[28:53] but anyway so
[28:55] uh I know it you probably should but
[28:57] anyway I think we was 217 the uh
[29:01] yesterday afternoon and so I think
[29:03] another day because on the strict diet
[29:05] and so uh I think we'll get it back down
[29:07] I plan on getting it back down to you
[29:10] know 180 140 130 whatever it's supposed
[29:12] to be amen and try to just diet right
[29:15] Eat Right amen
[29:17] and so that's where it's at and so if I
[29:20] acted a little silly amen one time I had
[29:22] I know sometimes you say say stuff you
[29:25] know your mind Skips a little bit right
[29:27] not especially when you're up there it's
[29:29] a wonder I didn't skip more than I did
[29:32] but anyway I'm just thankful I'm
[29:35] thankful because when I was here I was
[29:38] good enough to preach you know and that
[29:40] was over 500 so and it was way I I had I
[29:44] don't know I really had to be way out
[29:45] there folks so thank the Lord right that
[29:49] he spared me watch that for me and then
[29:51] I went and took the test just to find
[29:53] out you know and to me I didn't want to
[29:55] hear nothing of it even though my dad
[29:56] had it pretty heavy and my mother got it
[29:58] at 80 just before she passed away she
[30:01] said she had it you know but my dad had
[30:03] it heavy I think Grandpa and a lot of in
[30:05] our families have it has it
[30:07] has it hasn't yeah but anyway so I've
[30:10] never worried about it you know and and
[30:12] didn't accept their claim it so but I
[30:15] praise God that uh you know 60 years you
[30:18] know without any of that problems I
[30:20] praise God for it amen amen and so
[30:23] anyway
[30:26] um
[30:27] I thought well
[30:29] I got to thinking about it you know and
[30:32] all these weeks coming up to it and how
[30:35] really bad I felt just not wanting to do
[30:38] anything couldn't hardly do anything and
[30:39] now that I'm gonna die this is man I'm
[30:42] singing I'm happy I'm you know even in
[30:45] the 250 realm hello 275 around me there
[30:49] I I'm feeling really good you know and
[30:51] so
[30:52] um I'm thankful to feel better and to
[30:54] know what it is and what I'm fighting
[30:56] amen like brother Steve said you got to
[30:58] know what you're fighting and so forth
[30:59] and so I'm thankful to feel better and I
[31:02] thought well you know
[31:03] hmm you know I said I know the Lord
[31:06] doesn't allow anything to come upon you
[31:08] unless you're allows it is that right
[31:10] nothing comes on you unless God allows
[31:12] it so you know I thought well maybe
[31:15] maybe this is a blessing in disguise
[31:17] that's gonna be my title tonight
[31:20] and so because you know if I I told my
[31:24] wife and my wife even said you know you
[31:25] just can't eat them half gallon of ice
[31:27] creams and all of that other stuff and
[31:30] every night you know
[31:33] that
[31:34] hot dog you know anything I want to eat
[31:37] you know I was getting a big belly and
[31:38] stuff and I was I jumped back up there
[31:40] to well we won't say the number but
[31:42] anyway for the eye
[31:44] and so you know I thought well you know
[31:46] if I kept going that way in five six
[31:49] years who knows I'm gonna had a heart
[31:50] attack right a stroke who knows what
[31:53] happened
[31:54] so if God allows this to thin me down
[31:57] and to get me on a DOT Eden right and
[31:59] feeling better you know I'll probably
[32:01] live longer this way I would do the
[32:02] other way so I you know I don't know
[32:05] amen I don't know if just what the local
[32:08] plan of the Lord is but amen all things
[32:12] work together for good to them to love
[32:13] God how many believe that and so anyway
[32:15] just pray for me that uh amen I've got a
[32:18] wonderful wife back there that cooks
[32:20] some really good food and I'm telling
[32:21] you what
[32:23] happy I was real happy when I heard that
[32:24] you could eat meat shrimp
[32:27] shrimp right I got a lot to learn but
[32:29] I'll tell you what all of them things
[32:31] sauce together pretty good it's pretty
[32:33] good amen so it's not not you know but
[32:36] I'm just thankful amen that God watched
[32:38] over me during the time that I tried to
[32:40] quench my thirst and the higher it would
[32:43] go the drier my mouth would go the more
[32:45] I'd drink and you know you you know
[32:47] where you're going to go there you know
[32:49] and so praise God I did amen but by the
[32:52] grace of God and I'm thankful for it so

[33:11] his uh high sugar will be controlled and
[33:13] the Lord will just keep it the way it's
[33:15] supposed to be
[33:16] amen so yesterday my wife just a little
[33:18] funny my wife she said well let me check
[33:21] mine

[33:24] that little pricker closer
[33:31] she was just screaming at home

[33:40] to be for the Lord so amen that was
[33:44] funny I reacted but anyway

[33:50] Brother Barry brother Byler and the
[33:52] Saints God bless you and thanks so much
[33:54] for the offering
[33:56] sent for the people of you crane the
[33:59] needs are great and they are continuing
[34:00] to experience real hardships in the
[34:03] shadow
[34:06] of the war your support is very timely
[34:09] God bless you and thank you amen
[34:12] amen that thing just carries on and
[34:15] Carries On doesn't it amen one more
[34:18] thing I want to do here
[34:19] this is when you might want to zoom in
[34:23] hey man talk to trustee board Deacon
[34:25] board and so forth and about
[34:27] uh the Mennonite that came to us and
[34:29] wanting to buy some of this field back
[34:31] here I mean they're Rocky rough terrain
[34:34] down there and uh
[34:37] then of course we know that I think it's
[34:39] Joe hunt over here
[34:41] he also Brother Brad had said that he
[34:43] wanted to find out if we ever sell that
[34:45] landed back there or whatever he want to
[34:46] know so I went and talked to him the
[34:49] other day he says he's all hyped up
[34:50] about it so what we want to maybe do
[34:53] and back again to the story of the
[34:55] deacons and trustees everybody's in
[34:57] favor of bringing it before the church
[34:59] and then let the church vote whether we
[35:02] might want to sell it and then take
[35:04] however much we get and pay off the
[35:06] principle of the church amen
[35:08] and we don't know how much we don't know
[35:10] exactly the boundaries and all that but
[35:11] we're going to get as much as of course
[35:13] we possibly can and right now of course
[35:15] the prices are real high and it seems
[35:18] the selling's pretty easy so I think
[35:19] it's definitely a good time amen but uh
[35:22] we want your permission I mean it's up
[35:24] to you if we don't sell it that's fine
[35:25] too you know uh just whatever whatever
[35:28] we want to do but since they asked
[35:30] somebody asks and I know
[35:33] how rough the land is and stuff I'm not
[35:35] I'm not all that gumbo about it and if
[35:37] somebody wants to give me
[35:39] a pretty good price for it I'm I'm like
[35:41] well hey be nice to have this place paid
[35:44] for we're not
[35:45] so that's the plan is to go to that I
[35:47] wanted to show you and I might Sunday
[35:49] again too but I want to show you a
[35:50] little bit of the idea if anybody has
[35:53] really curious of where the property
[35:55] lines and what we want to do is uh we're
[35:58] going to cut it off first I'll just
[35:59] explain that you all know the woods down
[36:01] here so it'll be on that side of the
[36:03] woods coming up right up to the edge
[36:05] where that starts to curve up and go
[36:08] over you know on our this year that's
[36:10] going to stay but down over the edge
[36:12] down in the edge of the field well my
[36:14] fence line basically you'll see in the
[36:15] fence line back there maybe just a
[36:17] little bit further that way up to the
[36:20] corner of the woods and then it'll go
[36:22] either straight across all the way there
[36:24] but if we sell it to Joe hunt then we
[36:27] need to come and angle it back from the
[36:30] other corner to it angle it back up to
[36:32] his yard like or just a little bit just
[36:34] enough to where he can get on that from
[36:36] his property
[36:37] amen and
[36:39] were
[36:40] Mennonites not listening but uh I would
[36:43] favor I would favor It with Joe because
[36:45] I know that he'll probably just have
[36:47] some cows and a food plot on it or
[36:49] whatever but the other Mennonite was
[36:51] talking about maybe selling it to
[36:53] somebody that's interested in maybe
[36:55] putting a he mentioned a butcher Butcher
[36:58] Shop like Fairview butchering or
[37:00] whatever down somewhere over there if
[37:02] that was the case of course we want to
[37:04] plant some trees along that fence down
[37:05] there so it's just pretty much closed
[37:07] from there there and you won't see it
[37:09] much more than it's be about as far away
[37:12] as from this up this would be up here so
[37:14] that's kind of where it's at I hope
[37:16] everybody out there is getting it and
[37:17] listening because I want you to pray
[37:18] about it till Sunday and then I'd like
[37:20] to take a vote Sunday all right if uh I
[37:24] could get a couple people come up here
[37:25] and hold this for a minute
[37:28] all right
[37:30] can you zoom in I we might do this
[37:32] Sunday yet but uh I'm just going to put
[37:35] it this way we'll show it tonight and
[37:36] then if anybody's curious about property
[37:38] lines please uh contact one of us
[37:41] and we'll we'll go over it with you so
[37:43] that you can understand both here and
[37:45] out there okay so here's the uh old
[37:49] church facility this is the fellowship
[37:51] hall and of course this is where a
[37:53] volleyball is here this big church is
[37:55] somewhere right here okay and this is
[37:58] the property line on the corner of that
[37:59] back woods over there and that's pretty
[38:02] much pretty close to my fence that I got
[38:04] running through there so it would be
[38:05] right through here all the way up to the
[38:08] edge of this woods and then this is this
[38:11] is the old Daniel Bell it's Joe hunt now
[38:13] but we would either come
[38:16] well whoever it is Woods is I'm not sure
[38:18] just where this wood is but from here
[38:20] across like this way and if uh we could
[38:23] go to any of these Stakes to make sure
[38:25] that joke could access this us trustees
[38:29] and deacons will really decide on some
[38:30] of this here that all has to be these
[38:32] guys and Survey but it goes way down it
[38:35] and our property doesn't go to the edge
[38:37] of the field even though I fenced it all
[38:39] off and then my cows on there for many
[38:42] years they said hey you know them rock
[38:45] quarry people don't like people on them
[38:47] too much you might get in trouble so
[38:48] anyway I wish all back up to the
[38:51] property line and I'll need to get the
[38:52] fence down but it's not all the way in
[38:54] the field it goes back here a little bit
[38:56] from the edge of the field up okay and
[38:58] then this runs along the houses out
[39:00] there way out there it runs right along
[39:02] the back of them houses it goes across
[39:04] the ditch partially up in the woods
[39:06] there's you know quite a bit right over
[39:07] on the other side you know but the creek
[39:09] runs down through here somewhere but uh
[39:12] this is the section from here over it
[39:13] wouldn't you know we still have room for
[39:16] plenty of room back here if we wanted to
[39:17] do something and we'll have the field
[39:19] over here on the side straight down
[39:21] behind the fellowship hall that little
[39:23] field still be ours graveyard all of
[39:25] that air is gonna be us
[39:26] okay but pretty much from the back side
[39:28] of that Woods over and maybe a little
[39:30] jot over is what we're thinking about
[39:31] selling okay
[39:34] all right so everybody pray about that
[39:36] and if you have questions let us know
[39:46] all right let's stand
[39:49] go before the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus
[39:51] we come before you once again Lord
[39:52] grateful
[39:53] Lord to be in your house Lord to have
[39:55] strength Lord Jesus to have energy Lord
[39:57] Jesus to be able to worship you in
[40:00] spirit and in truth to bring honor glory
[40:02] to Your Name Lord and we ask God that
[40:04] you would just bless the service tonight
[40:06] in every aspect Lord and a little
[40:08] thought that heal Lord You've laid upon
[40:09] my heart to minister God may it be a
[40:12] blessing father to those here and those
[40:14] that are out there on the web Lord Jesus
[40:16] watching bless them father in Jesus name
[40:19] amen
[40:21] amen if you will turn to Hebrews the
[40:24] 12th chapter and tonight I had two
[40:28] Germans on my heart and I'm not really
[40:30] going to say that uh but this is one
[40:33] time that I've chosen felt led to
[40:36] changed what I was going to preach
[40:37] tonight because I was going to go a
[40:39] different route most all day but I had
[40:41] another thought laid on my heart and and
[40:44] something just I just felt led to preach
[40:46] this tonight because uh this will be a
[40:48] little shorter and the other one I would
[40:50] I definitely like everybody here because
[40:52] it has to do with the squeeze it has to
[40:55] do with uh modern events that are being
[40:59] made clear by prophecy so probably
[41:00] Sunday morning it'll be modern events
[41:02] May being made clear by prophecy things
[41:04] that's going on that prophecy that's
[41:06] coming to pass and so forth and I've had
[41:08] a lot of reading a lot of quotes from
[41:10] brother Brandon but tonight uh that
[41:12] little thought came on to the little
[41:14] thought came on to me about blessings in
[41:16] Disguise amen and so we want to just
[41:19] speak a little while on that
[41:21] um let's go with Hebrews 12.
[41:24] Hebrews 12.
[41:27] and
[41:34] verse 5. and ye have forgotten the
[41:38] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[41:40] unto children my son despised thou not
[41:43] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[41:45] when thou art rebuked of him for whom
[41:48] the Lord loveth he chasteneth and
[41:50] scourges every son whom he receiveth
[41:53] receive it if ye endure chastening God
[41:57] deals with you as with sons for what son
[42:00] is he whom the father chasteneth not but
[42:03] if ye be without chastisement whereof
[42:05] all our partakers then ye are bastards
[42:09] not son furthermore we have had fathers
[42:11] of our flesh which corrected us and gave
[42:13] us them and we gave them reverence shall
[42:16] we not much rather be in subjection unto
[42:19] the father of spirits and live
[42:21] for they merrily for a few days chasing
[42:24] us after their own pleasure but he for
[42:27] our Prophet that we might be partakers
[42:31] of his Holiness now no chastening for
[42:33] the present seemeth to be joyous
[42:35] but Grievous nevertheless afterwards it
[42:38] yielded the Peaceable fruit of
[42:39] righteousness unto them which are
[42:41] exercise thereby wherefore lift up the
[42:44] hands that hang down in the feeble knees
[42:47] in other words be encouraged you know
[42:49] right and I like the part where it says
[42:54] for rarely verse 10 for they verily for
[42:58] a few days chasing enough that chastened
[43:00] us after their pleasure their own
[43:02] pleasure but he for our Prophet amen
[43:06] for our Prophet I mean it's for us
[43:09] that mean my partakers of his holy
[43:11] Holiness may God add His blessings to
[43:13] the reading your word the message of
[43:15] course being blessings in disguise
[43:19] blessings in Disguise or disguised
[43:24] blessings I like that
[43:27] disguised blessing now you all know that
[43:29] I have preached on trials and tests and
[43:32] all of that 100 million well not maybe
[43:34] that much time but a bunch of times you
[43:37] know right a whole lot of time but this
[43:38] is just another little angle if that's
[43:40] all right is that okay
[43:41] amen so we see here that uh God of
[43:45] course he allows tests or trials
[43:47] whichever you want to call them because
[43:49] to me they're about same thing trial is
[43:51] a test amen
[43:53] talking about it's for our good amen
[43:57] it's for our good not just for our
[43:59] parents good or whatever but it's for
[44:01] our good amen that things and trials and
[44:04] things come upon us praise God Amen
[44:06] because you know I I you know it you
[44:08] know it's yeah
[44:10] whenever something happens to you you
[44:13] know or when something bad happens to
[44:15] somebody else or whatever you know
[44:17] sometimes it's a like a recession but
[44:20] when it happens to you it's a depression
[44:23] amen it's a little different story when
[44:25] it comes down home so that's the way it
[44:27] is with me tonight it comes down home
[44:29] amen and and so uh you know but I'm so
[44:33] grateful I'm so grateful that it doesn't
[44:35] matter it no matter what comes down your
[44:37] road as long as God is with you isn't
[44:41] that right amen he'll take care
[44:44] oh I'm so glad to have a caretaker amen
[44:47] praise be to God Amen
[44:50] now listen now brother bam says now
[44:52] before you can have a victory there has
[44:54] to be a battle if there's no battles
[44:56] there's no Victory so we ought to be
[44:58] thankful for the battles into trying
[45:00] is God given us the opportunity to have
[45:03] a victory
[45:05] amen praise the Lord oh my don't that
[45:08] make you feel a lot better now see the
[45:10] battle comes along and somebody's saying
[45:12] something bad about your sickness come
[45:14] on you maybe God gave you those light
[45:16] afflictions that he might heal you to
[45:18] show you favor to you
[45:21] let you see what it what he means by it
[45:23] he loves you
[45:26] amen
[45:27] like the old Shepherd story that was
[45:30] told there of Jerusalem in the Holy
[45:31] lands of the Shepherds and the shepherd
[45:34] was packing a sheep and he said what are
[45:36] you packing it for said it's got a
[45:38] broken leg and they say well what what
[45:41] did it what happened did it fall over a
[45:43] cliff said no I broke his leg
[45:50] no I broke his leg while you are a cruel
[45:53] Shepherd
[45:54] to break that sheep's leg said no I
[45:57] loved it
[45:59] and said it was going astray and I
[46:02] couldn't make it mind me so I broke its
[46:04] legs so that I could give it some
[46:06] special attention
[46:08] so that it would love me more and follow
[46:11] me
[46:13] sometimes God has to let us break down
[46:15] just a little bit in health to give us a
[46:18] little extra attention
[46:21] praise be to God
[46:23] oh my
[46:25] tonight I want to talk a little bit
[46:27] about people who
[46:30] tonight I want to talk a little bit
[46:31] about people who have the big
[46:35] you know the times that we ask what is
[46:38] God doing
[46:39] huh what is going on here
[46:43] you know because God does that in our
[46:45] lives what's going on
[46:47] how can this be of God
[46:50] huh
[46:53] Amen to woo us up in his bosom when the
[46:57] doctor said that nothing can be done
[47:00] then he takes into his us into his bosom
[47:03] and says I love you I'm gonna let you
[47:06] get well see oh he does doesn't that
[47:09] just make you feel a little bit better
[47:11] praise the Lord
[47:13] how many knows that everything that
[47:15] happens
[47:16] it always brings us closer to God
[47:20] the trials and the tests and the things
[47:22] that we go through
[47:23] does one more thing and that is it
[47:26] brings God more Glory
[47:30] I remember brother Branham he was
[47:33] preaching and he said
[47:34] and and get in the service bless the
[47:37] service Lord and get glory to yourself
[47:40] God get glory to himself because I mean
[47:44] please knows that he's worthy of Glory
[47:48] honor power strength everything he's
[47:52] worthy of all that
[47:53] oh he's so great he's a marvelous
[47:56] Shepherd isn't he no wonder David said
[47:59] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[48:02] he leads me beside the Still Waters he
[48:05] restores my soul and runs our cups over
[48:09] and anoints us in the presence of our
[48:11] enemy that's the only quote we have
[48:12] tonight amen
[48:13] so I like to go down a little bit can we
[48:15] just take a little trip amen
[48:18] amen all the way back oh my we could go
[48:21] so far back but we see how that so many
[48:24] times God allows us to get into places
[48:26] that we don't understand
[48:29] amen
[48:31] but I go to the scripture where Romans
[48:33] says for whom he did no not for whom did
[48:36] for we know that all things work
[48:38] together for good to them that love God
[48:40] how many believe that to them that are
[48:42] to call according to his purpose God
[48:45] makes if you're part of God part his
[48:48] program he makes all things work for the
[48:51] good and I want to take some instances
[48:53] in some cases tonight to where
[48:55] ultimately even though it was the most
[48:59] horrible things that happened to people
[49:01] in the end
[49:03] there was a blessing behind it all
[49:07] at all it looked terrible
[49:09] trials look terrible they seemed
[49:12] terrible
[49:13] isn't that what it said Chast typing and
[49:16] all these things said are Grievous but
[49:18] it yields the Peaceable fruit of
[49:21] righteousness
[49:23] it always comes out right
[49:24] amen
[49:26] we think about we think about of course
[49:29] you know how all the way let's talk
[49:31] about Israel perhaps you know on that
[49:34] day gloriously come out of Egypt and
[49:37] come up down to the Red Sea isn't that
[49:39] right now right they come down there and
[49:42] they could not understand what's going
[49:44] on they complained didn't they
[49:46] he ran straight down to the Red Sea to a
[49:49] dead end
[49:50] a place that couldn't go further forward
[49:52] they couldn't go backwards they couldn't
[49:54] go sideways
[49:56] it seemed bad
[50:00] huh
[50:01] it seemed so terrible
[50:04] that the people no doubt what's going on
[50:06] what's God doing what's going on here
[50:09] huh
[50:12] but in the end what did it do it brought
[50:16] glory to God like you've never seen
[50:20] God opened up a path God opened up a way
[50:23] for him
[50:25] and on the other side they were
[50:27] screaming and hollering and Miriam
[50:29] dancing up and down and everywhere
[50:32] wasn't she
[50:33] that was a blessing there there between
[50:36] a rock and a hard place that place a
[50:39] dead end seeming light
[50:41] ended up being a blessing
[50:44] just like the prophet said you know he
[50:46] may take you to the hospital the doctor
[50:47] May say you're gonna die
[50:51] huh
[50:54] pretty rough place
[50:56] huh
[50:58] but you find out most of the time it
[51:00] brings you closer to God
[51:04] there's something beautiful that comes
[51:05] from it
[51:07] amen
[51:09] when I was so sick and and getting
[51:11] better and so forth beginning to feel
[51:12] better you know I just appreciated
[51:14] feeling better so much more
[51:16] not only that I was weak in my flesh but
[51:19] I was closer to God
[51:21] I began to understand you know sometimes
[51:23] that's what Paul talked about when we're
[51:25] weak in our flesh then we're stronger in
[51:28] the spirit
[51:29] he brings to Israel weak in their flesh
[51:32] they couldn't do anything
[51:35] but if data just believed right and
[51:37] trusted God
[51:39] it had been so much better off
[51:42] amen but we know that most of them
[51:44] didn't pass a test did they
[51:47] no they didn't realize hey there's a
[51:50] blessing in that if we could just
[51:52] realize that
[51:53] because there's many times many things
[51:55] that happen terrible in our lives losing
[51:58] loved ones it can be anything
[51:59] that we might think we want to thank God
[52:02] how can this be good how can this be
[52:05] good
[52:07] huh
[52:08] but you know I believe the prophet says
[52:10] you shouldn't question God
[52:13] you should realize that everything that
[52:15] happens to a believer
[52:17] and I believe it I believe that nothing
[52:21] can come upon nothing can happen to you
[52:23] without permission
[52:25] I'd have never got that box without
[52:27] permission first
[52:29] huh
[52:31] I ain't got to sign for it but God's
[52:33] going to get Glory out of it all
[52:36] amen
[52:38] praise be to God
[52:40] same way with Israel if they said look
[52:43] we're in God's hand God is more than
[52:45] able
[52:47] amen
[52:48] remember Israel at Katie sparnia y'all
[52:52] remember when they finally made all the
[52:54] rounds and they were fixing to cross
[52:55] over and despise went over across there
[52:59] and meant we know that the spies came
[53:02] back ten of them and they said man the
[53:04] walls they run chariot races unto at
[53:07] Jericho isn't that right they were on
[53:10] jediers Giants folk I have to hide
[53:12] behind the bushes before all that big
[53:14] giant stomp past me it was scary folks
[53:18] huh
[53:19] so how many knows that the the uh the
[53:22] obstacles that they faced were great
[53:26] don't never think that God's gonna give
[53:28] you a little obstacle unless that's all
[53:31] you can handle you God usually gives you
[53:33] big obstacles
[53:36] real tests real trials like he did death
[53:41] half of them or ten of them said we
[53:44] aren't able to take it it's way man
[53:46] they're way too strong for us
[53:50] amen if they had just believed
[53:54] so now we don't know here we are we're
[53:56] facing these big giants and big city
[53:58] walls and big things that you can't
[54:00] handle that you can't do
[54:03] if you could just realize hey this isn't
[54:05] got to be a blessing in this somewhere
[54:07] huh because when they finally went over
[54:10] there in that right when they crossed
[54:11] and I'm thinking that they dried up the
[54:13] water again didn't they went on dry
[54:15] ground again the second time to cross
[54:17] over
[54:18] amen and did Joshua I love that little
[54:22] song my grandkids and I catch a few of
[54:24] them sing I wish Grace you would have
[54:26] them sing that song Sunday maybe
[54:28] Joshua was how was it Joshua Fought the
[54:32] Battle of Jericho Jericho is that right
[54:35] there he was and he went around and
[54:38] around and around he didn't just
[54:40] realized this is gonna turn out to be a
[54:42] blessing
[54:43] whoa
[54:45] walls come tumbling down
[54:48] praise be to God you could just realize
[54:51] that your trial
[54:53] is a blessing in disguise
[54:56] don't believe that
[54:58] yeah it may seem really bad
[55:02] but guess what if you trust the Lord in
[55:04] it there's a God speaks to do something
[55:07] when he heals you when he makes you
[55:09] better whatever he does what's it going
[55:11] to do brother bam says he gives you that
[55:13] so did you have a testimony of how real
[55:15] God is in your life
[55:21] especially if you start straying or
[55:23] getting away from God is that right
[55:26] he just may break your leg
[55:28] it would be hard to understand wouldn't
[55:30] it seeing a shepherd and a broken leg
[55:32] and say I broke it
[55:34] huh
[55:36] but that little lamb can't get around it
[55:38] has to be handled it probably has to be
[55:40] held half the time and laid there it has
[55:42] to be brought its food and it has to be
[55:43] taken care of it has to be I have a
[55:45] whole lot of love
[55:46] it'll appreciate walking
[55:48] it'll appreciate its master
[55:51] amen
[55:53] oh my thank you Lord Jesus for watching
[55:55] over me amen I'm glad to have a shepherd
[55:57] that Watches Over You takes care of you
[56:00] amen heals you back up
[56:03] praise the Lord
[56:05] oh my
[56:08] it was terrible
[56:10] when Israel under Saul were pinned down
[56:14] by the Philistines in Goliath for days
[56:18] and weeks perhaps would get out there
[56:20] and run his mouth
[56:23] and they'd have to listen to his mouth
[56:24] all the time they were scared because
[56:27] they had no doubt got beaten back isn't
[56:30] that right they got beaten back and they
[56:32] said man we are the armies of God you
[56:35] know what we were supposed to be
[56:36] Victorious and here we are hiding in our
[56:38] foxholes this enemy of our keeps posting
[56:44] huh
[56:48] oh you're 425. you lying devil up you
[56:52] ain't got no rights here
[56:55] no think about it that Old Devil
[56:57] thinking about man we're good you know
[57:00] y'all serve us you know and so forth but
[57:03] what was God doing they were all tense
[57:05] they were all stressed
[57:07] but you know different times when God
[57:09] was going to make somebody king or raise
[57:11] him up or make him popular among the
[57:13] people or like among the people are
[57:15] accepted or honored or whatever he
[57:17] wouldn't allow something to happen you
[57:19] know and he was letting him he would
[57:21] letting Israel come in that place God
[57:23] had a plan I mean God had a plan all
[57:25] things work together pretty good he
[57:27] added David bring a little basket of
[57:29] food
[57:31] for his brothers
[57:33] the plan Here Comes God's plan
[57:37] he's going to make it to work for the
[57:39] good here comes the blessing David
[57:42] and all he did
[57:43] was bringing the brothers food the
[57:46] brothers were skeptical of it and then
[57:48] shyster soda's big you come down here
[57:51] because you wanted to see the battle
[57:53] you know my dad told me to bring that
[57:55] food
[57:58] all of a sudden David heard off in the
[58:00] distance I defy by the armies of the
[58:03] Living God and all this other stuff why
[58:07] there's water around here he got
[58:09] inspired
[58:10] isn't that right he got inspired
[58:13] that's the difference when you get
[58:15] inspired
[58:16] this who is this uncircumcised feelings
[58:19] see running his mouth I'd like to shut
[58:21] him up
[58:23] you know
[58:24] and he went over there and David was a
[58:28] nobody
[58:30] David was just
[58:31] sheep her he couldn't even join the Army
[58:34] he was too little probably
[58:37] huh couldn't even join and so forth you
[58:40] know it's all after uh David told him
[58:42] look God delivered the lion and the bear
[58:44] to me he'll deliver him to me
[58:47] put all of his armor on and his get this
[58:49] off of me just give me my slinging God
[58:51] and we'll take care of it
[58:53] and been out of that terrible situation
[58:55] there what happened
[58:58] greatest blessing
[58:59] great is blessing Amen to David when he
[59:02] went over there I don't still don't know
[59:04] how nervous everybody was all the
[59:06] unbelievers have to be nervous seeing
[59:08] this little running fella going over
[59:10] there and we're all going to be slaves
[59:11] right
[59:13] they were a little bit unbelievable
[59:14] there's a lot of unbelieving Israelites
[59:17] they're always complaining and murmur
[59:19] and never believing that anything's
[59:21] possible
[59:23] but when that big old giant fell
[59:25] backwards in the dust flew up David went
[59:28] over there amongst dust cut his head off
[59:31] and come up out of the dust and said
[59:32] here it is
[59:37] everybody got inspired
[59:40] how many knows when one person in this
[59:42] church if one person will get inspired
[59:44] you don't know but the next person I
[59:46] didn't might get inspired we need people
[59:49] that get inspired
[59:51] we need now
[59:55] do you want me inspired or do you want
[59:57] me to just well now
[59:59] we're gonna learn our ABCs tonight and
[1:00:03] you know
[1:00:04] is it nice to have it inspired or
[1:00:06] anointed preacher
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:09] and I want to tell you this I believe
[1:00:11] every one of us can be inspired every
[1:00:13] one of us anointed
[1:00:15] but it all depends on how much you get
[1:00:16] into it
[1:00:18] is that right
[1:00:19] been a while since I heard come on
[1:00:21] brother by the preach it
[1:00:23] it's okay you know it's taking me on be
[1:00:26] all right
[1:00:28] but he got inspired not and it inspired
[1:00:31] the rest of the Israelites they come
[1:00:33] jumping up out of there and it said they
[1:00:36] chased them and they chased them till
[1:00:38] dark all the way to the further parts of
[1:00:40] the land
[1:00:41] killing them left and right
[1:00:44] you know that's what happened in our day
[1:00:47] a David called mother Bynum
[1:00:50] inspired by God comments begin to shoot
[1:00:53] the enemy back so the days of Miracles
[1:00:55] is not fast all things are Tommy Hicks I
[1:00:57] believe in the different ones amen that
[1:00:59] went out and got into a room after they
[1:01:01] seen such person healed and he asked
[1:01:03] whether around him hey do you think that
[1:01:04] God would sue that you know for anybody
[1:01:06] yeah he would he went in the room and
[1:01:08] began to pray and he went out and God
[1:01:10] did a lot of the things through his
[1:01:12] ministry
[1:01:13] I mean most of those ministers even the
[1:01:15] prophets that most of the ministers what
[1:01:18] do you call uh rose up
[1:01:22] rose up under the prophet's Ministry
[1:01:25] and went out and many of them
[1:01:28] went out and did because of the
[1:01:29] inspiration
[1:01:31] but it was a blessing in disguise
[1:01:34] even though they were bogged down
[1:01:37] didn't know where to go
[1:01:39] can you imagine I would hate to be Saul
[1:01:41] I would hate to be a king
[1:01:43] in a stalemate nobody's going anywhere
[1:01:48] all you can do you would be praying God
[1:01:50] help me God help me
[1:01:52] yeah right
[1:01:53] how about Hezekiah this just comes to
[1:01:55] mind I remember Hezekiah the armies were
[1:01:58] all going to come against them you know
[1:01:59] and they did not have near enough to
[1:02:01] defeat him they were going to come in
[1:02:03] and they shed them send them letters of
[1:02:05] intimidation and so forth and intimidate
[1:02:07] them with the letters to set and
[1:02:09] everything you know but Hezekiah got in
[1:02:11] sackcloth now I should I believe it was
[1:02:12] her he got down before the Lord and he
[1:02:14] cried out God didn't
[1:02:17] yeah in a bad situation it was terrible
[1:02:20] the Army was going to come in on him but
[1:02:22] God delivered them how by causing them
[1:02:25] to turn on each other
[1:02:30] oh the more I talk about this faith
[1:02:33] comes by hearing
[1:02:34] the more I thankful to be serving a god
[1:02:37] that is a god of your everyday
[1:02:40] that you live no matter what happens no
[1:02:43] matter what comes your way God is God
[1:02:47] and he's not dead he's still alive
[1:02:50] amen it's the same yesterday today we're
[1:02:53] not just deserving the god of history
[1:02:55] but we're here servant of God of today
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:00] praise the Lord
[1:03:03] another reason that I'd all happened was
[1:03:06] because David need to be magnified amen
[1:03:08] after that he become very popular isn't
[1:03:11] that right
[1:03:12] very popular and eventually become king
[1:03:15] and that was God's way one way of God's
[1:03:17] one of God's ways to magnify David amen
[1:03:22] all right Joe let's talk about job for
[1:03:25] just a minute
[1:03:27] everybody anybody would wonder what in
[1:03:30] the world is going on even his friends
[1:03:32] and close friends said you're a secret
[1:03:34] sinner
[1:03:37] nah nah nah
[1:03:40] God's breaking your leg for sure
[1:03:44] uh
[1:03:45] but no it was simply because God was
[1:03:48] challenging the devil
[1:03:51] I was challenging the devil
[1:03:53] and he used job to beat him
[1:03:57] huh his job to beat the devil
[1:04:00] because he comes right down to it when
[1:04:02] he was so miserable
[1:04:05] Oh my he could he oh my job was
[1:04:09] miserable it was a terrible thing boils
[1:04:12] and he cursed today he was born and the
[1:04:15] son that it wouldn't shine on that day
[1:04:16] and all kinds of things
[1:04:19] oh he was very miserable
[1:04:23] amen and his wife seen him so miserable
[1:04:26] he said why don't you just Curse God I
[1:04:29] don't want to see you suffer like that
[1:04:33] Curse God and I I love you
[1:04:36] she might have went meant well but Paul
[1:04:38] said Paul said here we go job said
[1:04:41] thou speak is like a foolish woman
[1:04:44] and he worshiped God I mean when you're
[1:04:47] going through trials you know how you
[1:04:48] worship God you say the lord gave the
[1:04:51] Lord taken away blessed be the name of
[1:04:54] the Lord
[1:04:55] amen
[1:04:57] and he would not
[1:04:59] and he came out and the Bible says that
[1:05:00] he had twice God doubled everything he
[1:05:03] had and he gave him his children
[1:05:06] amen
[1:05:08] how did he give him his children
[1:05:10] only as a prophet of God in this
[1:05:12] generation could really tell you how
[1:05:14] didn't raise him back up but he gave him
[1:05:16] to him over there
[1:05:21] oh my you have to ask yourself if God
[1:05:24] would take your children like that
[1:05:27] huh wouldn't it be it's the most
[1:05:29] horrible thing would be to lose your
[1:05:31] children
[1:05:32] and then put something like that on you
[1:05:35] and you're like man what could I do
[1:05:36] because didn't do nothing
[1:05:39] but when his promise was that he would
[1:05:42] have his children
[1:05:43] it'd be like okay
[1:05:45] because perchance somehow or other they
[1:05:47] may be lost otherwise but God gave them
[1:05:49] it you're gonna have
[1:05:51] and not that but it was a blessing in
[1:05:53] disguise he gave him twice as much as he
[1:05:55] had before
[1:05:57] poor job was too busy after that wasn't
[1:05:59] he
[1:06:00] hey man because a lot of times we have
[1:06:02] so much until we're too busy
[1:06:04] but he's a large blessing in disguise
[1:06:06] Joe's trial was a blessing in disguise
[1:06:11] nothing seemed good you couldn't
[1:06:13] understand why what is God doing
[1:06:17] amen
[1:06:19] praise God
[1:06:21] what about the widow woman
[1:06:24] God-fearing lady isn't that right she
[1:06:28] had to be a God-fearing lady for Elijah
[1:06:30] to show up at her house
[1:06:32] amenity come right down to the last meal
[1:06:35] her and her son the last meal I got just
[1:06:39] a cup of this just a cup of oil I can
[1:06:42] make some bread and so forth we're gonna
[1:06:44] eat it and then we're gonna die
[1:06:47] and then the man comes along and says
[1:06:49] well bring me that first
[1:06:52] what
[1:06:53] wouldn't it be hard to understand uh
[1:06:55] yeah
[1:06:58] take my last what
[1:07:01] but she was praying
[1:07:04] she said okay can you imagine she was a
[1:07:06] giving person
[1:07:08] and she says well we're going to die
[1:07:10] anyhow let's give this man
[1:07:12] all right yeah
[1:07:15] she was willing to give it
[1:07:18] it looked bad the whole situation looked
[1:07:20] bad and then to ask that
[1:07:23] but it was a blessing coming down to her
[1:07:25] Lane
[1:07:26] a blessing in disguise all the days of
[1:07:29] the drought
[1:07:31] she ate good
[1:07:35] how many well I shouldn't do that
[1:07:40] how many knows the prophet typed her
[1:07:42] with the pride in this generation
[1:07:44] you know where there's a drawing a
[1:07:46] thirsty man
[1:07:48] or no food and no water is she says the
[1:07:50] people are drying up people are dying
[1:07:53] but the bride is going to have food
[1:07:55] stirred up
[1:07:57] she's gonna have a good
[1:08:00] good eating every day
[1:08:05] good Feast every day all the time
[1:08:08] until this is over
[1:08:11] aren't you glad it's not going to run
[1:08:13] out
[1:08:14] that's going to keep bringing us food
[1:08:16] he's going to keep feeding us all the
[1:08:18] way to the Rapture as a matter of fact
[1:08:20] you have a smorgasbord well everybody is
[1:08:24] dying of food and hunger and sir
[1:08:28] amen you are eating good
[1:08:33] hold on
[1:08:35] praise aren't you glad for that
[1:08:38] I'm very thankful for that
[1:08:40] it was a blessing it was a blessing in
[1:08:43] disguise
[1:08:44] her getting right down to that but she
[1:08:46] was
[1:08:47] still
[1:08:49] under the care of almighty God
[1:08:52] she was willing to give her last meal
[1:08:54] to God's prophet
[1:08:57] and after that
[1:08:59] and I don't imagine
[1:09:01] that she had to wait till evening
[1:09:04] if she
[1:09:05] wanted a snack
[1:09:07] at three o'clock or two o'clock it's all
[1:09:09] right take a little more out
[1:09:11] praise be to God aren't you thankful for
[1:09:13] that that's you you are all black you
[1:09:16] ain't lacking nothing
[1:09:17] God has given us everything we have need
[1:09:19] of
[1:09:21] amen
[1:09:27] it seemed real bad things went South for
[1:09:29] Jonah things went bad for donut
[1:09:34] and you know that brother Benham always
[1:09:35] stuck up for Jonah right
[1:09:37] wanna write
[1:09:38] and pretty much said the permissive what
[1:09:41] was the perfect will
[1:09:42] that knew just what he was doing
[1:09:45] but he picked the man that would
[1:09:48] not want to do the job
[1:09:50] all right that would go the other way
[1:09:53] because guess what he was going to have
[1:09:55] a fish prepared
[1:09:59] another way
[1:10:01] and preach to him and so forth and he
[1:10:04] went the other direction and then things
[1:10:06] began to get bad
[1:10:08] what happened
[1:10:09] until they threw everything out of the
[1:10:11] boat that they could possibly throw out
[1:10:13] of the boat to lighten the boat so they
[1:10:15] wouldn't die
[1:10:17] and it still wasn't enough and the boat
[1:10:20] was filling up and they
[1:10:23] cast lots or something amongst
[1:10:25] themselves to find out who why this is
[1:10:27] why is this storm this why are we going
[1:10:29] down
[1:10:30] that came on Jonah didn't it
[1:10:33] look at Jonah Jonah they fell on you
[1:10:35] it's you
[1:10:37] so there Jonah was
[1:10:39] at the sink
[1:10:41] he says well this is really turning out
[1:10:43] bad this can't be any worse what in the
[1:10:46] world is going on here
[1:10:47] as they grabbed him by his hands and his
[1:10:50] legs right
[1:10:52] and threw him in the water
[1:10:55] can you imagine he thought this is it
[1:10:57] I'm never gonna have to go to Nineveh
[1:11:00] now
[1:11:01] this is it I'm out of here I'm dead you
[1:11:03] know I'll never lose
[1:11:06] terrible you have to have a terrible
[1:11:09] feeling getting thrown into that ocean
[1:11:11] way out there in the middle of nowhere
[1:11:13] amen
[1:11:15] but I think it proves that God had
[1:11:18] it all planned out
[1:11:20] because the Bible says he had a special
[1:11:22] prepared fish
[1:11:24] amen but a bam said that there was an
[1:11:27] atheist or somebody saying proving that
[1:11:29] the Bible is wrong because he would take
[1:11:31] a great big Quail or something and said
[1:11:33] the the hole ain't big enough for a man
[1:11:35] to go through
[1:11:36] but random couldn't stand it he says you
[1:11:38] know he I beg to differ with you he says
[1:11:40] the Bible says that it was a special
[1:11:43] prepare
[1:11:47] I want to use the word stupid right now
[1:11:51] huh if God can make a whale he can
[1:11:54] surely prepare a special one with a big
[1:11:56] enough throat huh he made it all to
[1:11:59] begin with but doubting God
[1:12:02] the Bible says that it's true amen
[1:12:05] made a big throw he'd swallowed him
[1:12:08] how many knows
[1:12:10] three days and three nights
[1:12:13] don't have to think about it right
[1:12:15] he won't let me die
[1:12:17] going to go let me die
[1:12:19] here I am it is um
[1:12:23] how many months to talk to Jonas say was
[1:12:25] it really bunch of slobber what was what
[1:12:27] was it like
[1:12:29] all that muck in that acid and I'm
[1:12:32] telling you what I don't know about you
[1:12:33] but in three days You're Gonna feel the
[1:12:35] acid you're gonna feel something it's
[1:12:36] gonna be sticky
[1:12:38] dark
[1:12:41] huh
[1:12:44] [Laughter]
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:48] my bad situation
[1:12:51] very dark bleak
[1:12:54] but it was a blessing in disguise
[1:12:57] why
[1:12:58] because you see when the fish spit him
[1:13:01] out that fish I'm just going to perhaps
[1:13:04] say that he did like some sharks too
[1:13:06] perhaps and wiggle this way up to the
[1:13:09] beach and everybody was at the beach
[1:13:10] that day
[1:13:13] why I'm up through there and I said oh
[1:13:15] you got big trash you know and all of a
[1:13:17] sudden that big fish opened up
[1:13:21] out comes a man huh
[1:13:24] out comes a man on his hands and knees
[1:13:29] got spitting cloth everywhere come on
[1:13:33] the beach gets up
[1:13:35] everybody
[1:13:39] all kinds of mess
[1:13:41] isn't that right man man
[1:13:44] you know take some water to wash off and
[1:13:47] they're all
[1:13:49] right they're either
[1:13:51] that fish just spit a man up
[1:13:57] he got up y'all better repent y'all
[1:14:02] better repent on 30 days God's Gonna
[1:14:03] destroy all of you
[1:14:06] huh
[1:14:09] what did they do the governor and
[1:14:10] everybody this spread like wildfire
[1:14:13] said we better repent and we're going to
[1:14:15] perish
[1:14:17] and it just so happened that their God
[1:14:19] was a fish God
[1:14:20] right our God spit a man out to tell us
[1:14:23] we better repent we better repent
[1:14:27] ah and it's just what they needed
[1:14:30] he brought it in a way that they would
[1:14:32] hear it
[1:14:34] praise be to God
[1:14:36] you would wish it for this generation
[1:14:38] wouldn't you
[1:14:40] but God brought it he brought it and the
[1:14:43] way that they really couldn't deny it
[1:14:46] I mean if they can't deny it
[1:14:48] no they couldn't deny it
[1:14:51] that it was God
[1:14:52] coming and bringing it to him and they
[1:14:55] look at it
[1:14:56] they hear it and you either have to
[1:14:59] accept it or reject it
[1:15:01] like the brother bam says you know you
[1:15:03] just have to say this I ain't Shining
[1:15:05] I'm going to the basement and I'm
[1:15:07] shutting the windows and it's not sun
[1:15:09] shining out Christ hasn't come he hasn't
[1:15:11] Vindicated himself he hasn't prove
[1:15:13] himself God isn't real
[1:15:15] what he has right in front of you
[1:15:19] amen so this generation doesn't have any
[1:15:21] excuse do they
[1:15:23] no they're not going to have an excuse
[1:15:25] God did everything he possibly could
[1:15:29] to get this generation's attention to
[1:15:32] get them to repent
[1:15:34] amen
[1:15:37] amen
[1:15:39] last of all Jesus and the disciples
[1:15:44] all right
[1:15:45] that end the end of Jesus and the
[1:15:48] disciples was horrific
[1:15:51] it was terrible
[1:15:53] as brother bam says they were all
[1:15:55] deflated
[1:15:56] they didn't know what was going on what
[1:15:58] is going on we know he said something
[1:16:00] about dying and raising again but he's
[1:16:02] gone all our hopes are gone huh they
[1:16:05] came and they took him away
[1:16:07] now they have crucified and killed him
[1:16:10] and they all a lot of them went fishing
[1:16:11] a lot of them went ran their own
[1:16:13] different ways isn't it they all
[1:16:15] scattered
[1:16:17] it was so dark and Bleak until Peter was
[1:16:19] hungry and cold and he went in amongst a
[1:16:22] group to get a little food I believe it
[1:16:23] is and the worm himself you know and he
[1:16:25] was there by the fire and somebody says
[1:16:27] oh look
[1:16:29] oh look hey you were one of his
[1:16:30] disciples aren't you
[1:16:32] huh oh no doubt looked at him and he
[1:16:36] knowed him what could happen they may
[1:16:38] crucify him
[1:16:39] right they're gonna catch me
[1:16:42] no I'm not
[1:16:44] can you imagine how Peter felt
[1:16:47] how horrible it was to deny Christ
[1:16:50] not once what was it but twice
[1:16:54] three times before the crows crows
[1:16:57] that will deny me Thrice
[1:16:59] amen second time now we know that no I'm
[1:17:03] not
[1:17:05] yes you are blankety blank blank I am
[1:17:10] not
[1:17:11] you have to feel bad after that one
[1:17:13] didn't he
[1:17:15] oh yeah said he cursed
[1:17:18] to get him to convince that he wasn't
[1:17:20] the follower maybe after the curse words
[1:17:22] you're like well yeah you're probably
[1:17:24] right nobody would curse like that that
[1:17:25] was following him
[1:17:27] trying to convince him that he wasn't
[1:17:28] one
[1:17:34] he said he said I would do that
[1:17:40] what did he go out and weep bitterly
[1:17:44] bitterly weak it was
[1:17:47] dark
[1:17:49] dark
[1:17:50] hour
[1:17:54] so dark the sun refused to shine
[1:17:57] isn't that right
[1:17:59] for so long the time it was a dark hour
[1:18:02] but it was the greatest blessing ever
[1:18:06] in disguise
[1:18:08] I mean those the sufferings of Christ
[1:18:10] the terribleness of it all was the
[1:18:13] greatest blessing the world has ever
[1:18:15] known
[1:18:16] because God was going to purchase every
[1:18:18] one of his children
[1:18:20] he was buying him back he was purchasing
[1:18:23] this world
[1:18:24] he was making a way for you he was
[1:18:26] making him wait for your healing he was
[1:18:28] making a way for your salvation he was
[1:18:29] making the way for everything
[1:18:32] he says if I don't go away the Holy
[1:18:35] Ghost can't come I've got to go Peter
[1:18:37] didn't want this to happen because he
[1:18:39] said you know he took up well what did
[1:18:41] he say this should never happen I
[1:18:43] believe she said and Jesus said get thee
[1:18:45] behind me thou I say thou savior is not
[1:18:47] the thing to be of God
[1:18:48] and when it actually come time for them
[1:18:50] to come and take him
[1:18:52] I don't know
[1:18:53] where in the world did Peter find a
[1:18:55] sword I guess maybe the carried one I
[1:18:57] don't know
[1:18:58] maybe he grabbed one off of the soldiers
[1:19:00] or something I'll show you I used to be
[1:19:02] a soldier
[1:19:05] you reckon he was aiming for the ear or
[1:19:07] the head
[1:19:10] imagine your name before the year if he
[1:19:13] was aiming for the hearing he was a
[1:19:15] really good shot
[1:19:17] but not least smitten a split his skull
[1:19:20] this ain't happening
[1:19:22] ain't gonna take my master but they did
[1:19:25] huh
[1:19:28] isn't it amazing
[1:19:29] no doubt there was an angel there I'm
[1:19:31] not going to let him be a murderer
[1:19:33] and he put his hand right there
[1:19:36] let him get the ear Jesus did what
[1:19:38] perhaps picked up the ear
[1:19:41] but he said she went right back in there
[1:19:45] took his hand off perfectly normal
[1:19:49] give me that
[1:19:53] blind that means you use the word blind
[1:19:57] everybody saw that and they still don't
[1:19:59] believe he's the Messiah
[1:20:02] huh very very sad isn't it for them to
[1:20:05] be able to see something like that and
[1:20:06] still not believe that he's the Messiah
[1:20:07] and say no no no
[1:20:10] let me
[1:20:11] isn't it true that whenever they
[1:20:16] something else because it should have
[1:20:17] caught their attention because if I'm
[1:20:19] not wrong when they came Powers him what
[1:20:21] happened
[1:20:23] didn't the Bible says that they were not
[1:20:25] back
[1:20:26] they were knocked back by the power of
[1:20:28] God
[1:20:30] the first time they were knocked back if
[1:20:32] I'm not wrong
[1:20:33] and then they come again try it again I
[1:20:36] don't know about you but you think a
[1:20:38] person with sense would say woo I don't
[1:20:39] want a part of that
[1:20:41] did it they were persevering but out of
[1:20:43] that
[1:20:44] amen dark hour for the disciples very
[1:20:49] dark hour and for Jesus too I don't know
[1:20:52] if he was a very dark out for him he's a
[1:20:53] 50 cup if it'd be possible let this pass
[1:20:56] from me but nevertheless not my will he
[1:20:58] wept in the garden and so forth fought
[1:21:00] the greatest battle he ever did
[1:21:02] for you and for me
[1:21:04] so that 2000 and what is it 22
[1:21:08] you could enjoy the peace
[1:21:11] of God if you could un you could enjoy
[1:21:13] the forgiveness and Grace of almighty
[1:21:16] God
[1:21:18] and all of his blessings
[1:21:21] what a blessing
[1:21:23] it was in Disguise they thought it was
[1:21:24] horrible but to round out it wasn't so
[1:21:26] horrible
[1:21:27] amen
[1:21:29] when Peter got the revelation
[1:21:31] that he was alive
[1:21:33] isn't that right he heard he was alive
[1:21:35] and he believed he's alive didn't he run
[1:21:37] him and John they had a foot race they
[1:21:40] must have been kind of young couldn't
[1:21:41] have been my age they'd only got a few
[1:21:43] blocks and that had been hit they ran
[1:21:45] all away they just run and my they
[1:21:48] leaked for Joy he's alive he's alive
[1:21:50] he's alive and Unforgiven amen
[1:21:55] oh my Heaven's gates are open wide
[1:21:58] he's alive
[1:22:00] how many loves him but God bless you so

[1:22:04] understand that in your life
[1:22:07] and are what God allows to come your way
