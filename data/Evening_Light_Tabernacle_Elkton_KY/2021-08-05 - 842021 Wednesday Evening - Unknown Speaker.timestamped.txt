[26:21] jesus we're so thankful for that father
[26:24] that you are in our midst lord jesus
[26:26] doing uh
[26:27] your own good pleasure father and that
[26:29] the purpose of god
[26:31] might be fulfilled we ask god that you

[27:00] to minister father in jesus christ's
[27:02] name amen and amen
[27:05] amen god bless you tonight um
[27:09] i'm going to title this serving god
[27:12] serving god amen and so it's going to
[27:15] give us perhaps a little bit
[27:17] more clarity on how
[27:20] we serve god what we do
[27:23] to serve god that'd be all right
[27:27] amen what we can do i got wrote down
[27:29] here what we can do
[27:31] for jesus to serve him amen and that's
[27:34] something we all want to know a little
[27:35] bit more about
[27:36] what we can do to serve jesus a little
[27:38] bit more
[27:40] amen and so um
[27:43] amen if you will turn your bibles we'll
[27:46] go to matthew 23
[27:49] now matthew 25 i'm sorry
[27:55] and i told myself we'll probably have
[27:58] one of brother branham's
[28:01] sermons that he said that the sermon so
[28:04] long is
[28:05] really the best can anybody tell me how
[28:08] long that is
[28:11] 30 40 minutes what something like that
[28:15] amen so i was thinking 20 to 30 but
[28:18] anyway 30 to 40 be all right i guess too
[28:20] so
[28:21] amen praise the lord
[28:24] amen this is something we've heard a lot
[28:27] but it'll be perhaps just a little
[28:29] different
[28:30] angle so to speak but in matthew 25
[28:33] we'll read
[28:38] this is right after the parable of of
[28:41] a servant and so forth that you were
[28:42] given so many talents
[28:44] and so forth and the one hit it and so
[28:47] forth and then
[28:49] then it says in verse 29 for on
[28:53] that's chapter 25 of matthew
[28:56] and verse 29 for unto every one that
[28:59] hath shall be given and
[29:00] he shall have abundance but from him
[29:03] that hath not shall be taken away even
[29:05] at which he had
[29:07] and cast ye that unprofitable servant
[29:10] into outer darkness there shall be
[29:12] weeping and gnashing of teeth
[29:14] now this is really what i want to get to
[29:16] and when the son of man shall come in
[29:17] his glory
[29:19] and all the holy angels with him then
[29:21] shall he sit upon the throne of his
[29:23] glory
[29:24] and before him shall be gathered all
[29:27] nations
[29:28] and he shall separate them one from
[29:31] another
[29:32] as a shepherd divideth his sheep from
[29:34] the goats
[29:36] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[29:38] hand but the goats
[29:39] on the left then shall the king say unto
[29:42] them
[29:42] on his right hand come me blessed of my
[29:44] father inherit the kingdom prepare for
[29:47] you
[29:48] from the foundation of the world for i
[29:50] was unhungered
[29:51] and you gave me meat i was thirsty and
[29:54] he gave me
[29:55] drink i was a stranger and he took me
[29:58] in naked and he clothed me
[30:01] i was sick and he visited me i was in
[30:05] prison
[30:05] and he came unto me and then shall the
[30:08] righteous
[30:09] answer him saying lord when shall we be
[30:12] a hungered and fed thee or thirsty and
[30:14] gave thee drink
[30:16] when saw we thee a stranger and took the
[30:18] in or naked and clothed thee
[30:20] or when saw we the the sick or in prison
[30:24] and came unto thee the king shall answer
[30:26] and say anthony verily
[30:28] i say unto you insomuch as you have done
[30:30] it unto
[30:31] one of the least of these my brethren
[30:33] you have done it unto me. they shall
[30:36] say also to them on the left hand depart
[30:40] from me ye
[30:40] cursed into everlasting fire
[30:43] prepared for the devil and his angels
[30:47] for i was a hunger and you gave me no
[30:48] meat i was thirsty and he gave me no
[30:51] drink
[30:51] i was a stranger and he took me not in
[30:55] naked and he clothed me not sick and in
[30:57] prison and he visited me not
[30:59] then shall they also answer him saying
[31:03] lord when saw we the hungered and thirst
[31:06] and the stranger and naked and sick or
[31:08] in prison and did not minister unto thee
[31:11] then shall he answer them saying verily
[31:15] i say unto you in inasmuch as he did it
[31:18] unto the one of the least of these you
[31:19] did it unto me
[31:20] and these shall go away into everlasting
[31:23] punishment
[31:24] but the righteous unto eternal
[31:27] life i want to read one more in just one
[31:31] page back
[31:32] matthew 23.
[31:45] it was two pages back one all right
[31:50] all right so verse 27 what unto you
[31:53] scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye
[31:55] are like unto white as sepulchers which
[31:58] indeed appear
[31:59] beautiful on the outward but inward but
[32:01] our inward
[32:02] we are within full of dead men's bones
[32:05] and are of
[32:06] all uncleanness even so ye
[32:09] also outwardly appear righteous unto men
[32:12] but within you are full of hypocrisy
[32:14] and iniquity war unto you scribes and
[32:16] pharisees hypocrites because you build
[32:18] the tombs of the prophets and garnish
[32:20] the self occurs
[32:21] of the righteous and say if we had been
[32:24] in the days of our father
[32:25] we would not have been partakers with
[32:27] them in the blood of the prophets
[32:29] wherefore ye be witnesses unto
[32:31] yourselves that ye be the children of
[32:32] them which killed the prophets amen may
[32:36] god add his blessings to the reading of
[32:37] the words you can be seated
[32:41] amen so we find
[32:44] that the judgment what we see here
[32:49] is when the sound of man shall come in
[32:51] all of his glory and
[32:52] all the holy angels with him when he
[32:54] sits upon the
[32:56] throne of his glory and he gathers all
[32:58] the nations together
[32:59] he separates the sheep from the goats
[33:02] and
[33:02] isn't that amazing that he makes a
[33:05] statement
[33:06] like what he did amen this is what i
[33:08] want to talk about a little bit tonight
[33:11] with the help of the lord if you'll
[33:12] notice he didn't say well
[33:14] you didn't obey my commandments you
[33:17] didn't dress right you didn't do this
[33:19] you didn't believe
[33:20] he didn't talk about any of that he
[33:21] talked about how
[33:24] that they treated the people of god
[33:29] amen and if you'll notice what he says
[33:31] also he says
[33:33] as you have done unto the least of these
[33:35] you have done it unto me
[33:37] amen in both cases it was
[33:40] as you have done to answer the least of
[33:42] these you have done it unto me
[33:44] amen now we realize and we are taught
[33:47] by the angel of this hour that you know
[33:50] and also we
[33:51] by the scriptures that we find that you
[33:54] know
[33:54] uh we find that jesus even said to the
[33:57] scribes and the pharisees because they
[33:59] said with their mouth that if they'd
[34:01] have been back then
[34:02] if they'd have been back then they
[34:04] wouldn't be killing god's prophets
[34:06] right in other words we'd have been on
[34:08] the right side if we were back there
[34:11] right and so this really brings to light
[34:14] and this is going to come right down to
[34:17] every soul every individual but
[34:19] we find that they would try to say look
[34:21] i would have not been part of it but
[34:22] jesus said
[34:24] yes you would have been is that right
[34:26] another place he says they called
[34:28] themselves but abraham was the father
[34:30] and
[34:31] jesus said if abraham was your father
[34:33] you would believe
[34:35] me right because it's not
[34:38] necessarily if you want to know what you
[34:40] would have done with christ back in the
[34:42] gauge going by you could find out what
[34:45] you would have done back there but
[34:47] what you do with him now
[34:50] and they're right and we know that there
[34:52] would be a lot of people to say boy if
[34:54] i'd have walked ashore
[34:55] here godly i'd have believed him amen
[34:58] i'd accepted him on it on all of this
[35:00] you know but that's that's so much the
[35:03] point nowadays because
[35:04] jesus is still walking the shores of
[35:06] galilee so to speak
[35:08] and people are still doing certain
[35:10] things to him
[35:11] and notice how this was based upon what
[35:14] people
[35:15] do to christ's people and that's just
[35:16] the revelation i had this week
[35:18] about what we do to each other
[35:23] the way that we treat each other
[35:26] amen amen
[35:31] and i was thinking of how that you know
[35:34] the human being
[35:36] the human being is just about the
[35:39] hardest
[35:40] creature to love that god made
[35:45] it is you look back and look at
[35:49] friendships that have broken up look at
[35:52] friends and different ones
[35:53] it's hard to have a friend huh
[35:59] you don't have to aim it if you want to
[36:01] but because there's so many things that
[36:04] can be
[36:04] can come between us men hate each other
[36:07] many people
[36:08] people can't get along can they always
[36:10] fighting all fussing
[36:12] look at the marriages that break up
[36:14] that's a good sign of how well we can
[36:16] get along
[36:18] right not all that great
[36:22] not to mention we know that uh human
[36:25] especially
[36:26] human beings let me say this especially
[36:29] humanity
[36:30] that is ungenerated ungenerated
[36:34] unregenerated we're generated all right
[36:36] but not regenerated
[36:39] unregenerate people what did mother
[36:43] banham said that a man was if you didn't
[36:45] have the holy ghost
[36:47] he's nothing but a brute he's a he's
[36:50] he's a brute beast he's worse than an
[36:52] animal huh
[36:55] you know the animal kingdom and the
[36:57] females you know they don't allow the
[36:59] mill
[37:00] amen certain things unless they're ready
[37:02] and so forth but
[37:03] you know if they try to awesome that'd
[37:05] be a real problem but with man
[37:07] brother man said a real brute they'll
[37:09] throw a baby out of a mama's arms and
[37:11] ravage her
[37:12] that's how broody is terrible
[37:17] and when i was far as a woman
[37:18] unregenerated what did he say that she
[37:20] was
[37:22] he said that she's worse than a dog and
[37:26] if you think i preach hard
[37:28] brother bran preach hard she isn't worth
[37:31] the money that it costs to buy a
[37:34] bullet a clean bullet to shoot her with
[37:39] that's what i get from it that's pretty
[37:42] hard preaching ain't it
[37:44] that's real hard preaching why because
[37:47] she's worse than a dog
[37:50] right worse than the bible says she's
[37:52] watering the man's blood
[37:55] a bad woman is a water in a man's blood
[37:59] it's horrible amen
[38:04] a good woman oh what a treasure it is
[38:07] and that right the greatest
[38:08] treasure that you can have is a woman
[38:11] that's faithful i mean you can't have
[38:15] anything better but a woman that is
[38:16] unfaithful
[38:17] you know and we say we like mother bram
[38:19] so i said we call a dog a right
[38:22] why because she just she just goes all
[38:25] through the neighborhood and
[38:26] and any male that'll have her we'll have
[38:28] her just she's just that way because
[38:30] she's in her time
[38:31] and she's ready for her baby because
[38:32] barbara is natural she's want to have
[38:34] babies and so that's what she does
[38:36] we don't think much of it but she's
[38:38] nothing but a prostitute
[38:40] right and you know
[38:43] but it's the same way he says a woman
[38:45] knows better right
[38:47] when she does that she's worse because
[38:49] she knows better that woman only
[38:51] i mean that dog only does it because
[38:52] it's his nature
[38:54] amen and we find brothers just like i
[38:57] said in the human
[38:58] aspect of things it's the hardest the
[39:01] hardest species love
[39:02] is a human being we are rascals and
[39:06] we're not lethal we get the holy ghost
[39:08] how many knows that how many look at all
[39:10] the families hello
[39:11] we let's just look at this we as a
[39:14] christian family
[39:15] look hard it's hard it is for us to get
[39:17] along as christians
[39:20] thank you thank you very much that's
[39:21] exactly right even as a christian
[39:23] sometimes it's hard to get along
[39:26] and you've got to have a lot of holy
[39:27] ghosts to get along and love one another
[39:30] folks don't even read the news it's a
[39:32] massacre out there
[39:34] all right all this divorce with the man
[39:38] or the woman the man gets some
[39:39] children the woman doesn't or whatever
[39:41] they're just killing each other by the
[39:42] dozens
[39:43] it's a horrible world out there
[39:47] amen and it takes the baptism of the
[39:49] holy ghost takes
[39:50] a regeneration and so
[39:54] one of the hardest things that jesus
[39:57] ever said to us
[40:01] amen and that is
[40:04] he says in john 13 34 he says a new
[40:07] commandment
[40:08] i give unto you that ye love one another
[40:15] isn't that something he couldn't give
[40:17] him any
[40:19] kind of command but he said i'm
[40:20] commanding you to love one another
[40:24] he did you think he was gonna be easy he
[40:26] must know that it ain't gonna be easy
[40:28] no as i have
[40:32] loved you that ye also love one another
[40:35] and by this shall all men know that you
[40:37] ark are christian
[40:39] huh but obama says one place the
[40:42] greatest evidence that we're christians
[40:44] is when we love one another
[40:48] when we treat each other right
[40:52] when we love one another because that's
[40:55] a hard thing to do
[40:58] amen and not just
[41:01] as brothers right but also
[41:05] your enemy we as christians are
[41:08] commanded
[41:09] love them that hate you you can't
[41:13] dislike people you can't hate people
[41:19] amen i've been dealing with dogs a lot
[41:22] lately
[41:24] a lot of us do and how many knows i can
[41:27] under
[41:27] completely understand why they would say
[41:29] that a dog is a man's best friend
[41:34] huh because they are true and loyal
[41:38] huh they'll love on you and if you let
[41:41] them love a little bit they'll love on
[41:42] you more
[41:43] and if you ain't careful they'll lick
[41:45] you and kiss you and everything else
[41:47] that's right you got to watch that stuff
[41:50] why they just this is love they man
[41:52] they'll replay they'll come back with
[41:54] love
[41:54] but humans don't always do that do they
[41:57] loyal and everything
[42:00] but the bible says that we're looking
[42:02] one of the greatest evidences
[42:05] is that you love one another the way
[42:07] that people
[42:08] are going to know if you're christian or
[42:10] not is if you have love
[42:12] one for another and on that day
[42:16] think about it on that day god's gonna
[42:18] ask
[42:19] what did you do to my children right
[42:22] what did you do to my children
[42:25] the least of these
[42:28] now brother ben when he explained this
[42:30] scripture he talked about a christian
[42:34] but a christian the reason that they
[42:37] didn't
[42:37] that what they had to ask wait when did
[42:39] i ever see you hungry
[42:41] whenever that when did i ever feed you
[42:43] wouldn't that when did i ever visit you
[42:46] he said that did it just so
[42:48] automatically
[42:50] that they didn't even think about it he
[42:53] says that's the way it's supposed to be
[42:54] a fair christian
[42:56] it's so automatically help and so forth
[42:58] for people
[42:59] that it's just uh it's just natural it's
[43:02] just their nature
[43:05] now let me just place this scripture
[43:07] right
[43:08] okay uh let me place the scripture right
[43:11] because we
[43:12] feel that we fit in this category for
[43:14] one thing we're sheep
[43:15] right we are god's sheep but we're also
[43:17] the bride
[43:18] and this is also the scripture that
[43:20] brother brother branham used
[43:22] he says this is not necessarily the
[43:24] bride
[43:25] right this is not the bride in the
[43:28] judgment because the bride don't come
[43:30] into the judgment
[43:31] he says but this is the people that have
[43:33] done good deeds to the bride
[43:35] that are given life on that day right
[43:38] because of what they did because in this
[43:41] year that's
[43:42] exactly that's the only reason they were
[43:43] given life you did good to my people
[43:46] then therefore i'm giving you life
[43:48] but we still have this the same spirit
[43:51] we carry the spirit of love
[43:53] amen that fits this scripture amen
[43:57] and we have to realize tonight and we've
[43:59] got to realize one thing
[44:00] that the most important species the most
[44:02] important people that there is
[44:04] is god's people because god is in them
[44:09] amen all right
[44:16] serving god how can we
[44:20] serve god
[44:23] amen
[44:32] let's go to mark 9.
[44:38] go to mark 9 38
[44:46] we know that whether it was jesus or
[44:50] whether it was john the baptist
[44:52] or whether it was paul right the people
[44:55] in that generation that accepted john
[44:58] the baptist that accepted jesus
[45:01] that except that paul those are the
[45:03] people
[45:04] that were saved by almighty god right
[45:07] those are the people that were on the
[45:08] right side those who rejected those
[45:10] people
[45:11] because remember one time the pharisee
[45:14] says how can we work the works of god
[45:17] what was the answer
[45:21] believe on him whom he sent
[45:25] in other words the whole works of god is
[45:27] if god sent somebody
[45:29] the works of god is to believe the one
[45:31] that god sends
[45:33] amen because if you don't do that you
[45:36] don't believe god
[45:39] all right so now in mark 9
[45:42] and verse um
[45:48] 33 and he came to capernaum and being in
[45:51] the house he asked them
[45:53] what was it that he disputed among
[45:55] yourselves by the way
[45:57] but they held their peace for by the way
[45:59] they had disputed amongst themselves
[46:01] who ought to be the greatest
[46:05] another subject they wanted to talk
[46:07] about
[46:08] they just held their face and he sat
[46:11] down and he called the 12 and said unto
[46:13] him
[46:13] if any man to be sired be the first
[46:17] now let me ask you how many tonight
[46:19] wants to be great in the kingdom of god
[46:26] that's better yeah if you don't want to
[46:29] be great in the kingdom of god
[46:30] what is wrong with you you want to be
[46:33] the worst
[46:35] huh can somebody tell me who the worst
[46:38] is in the kingdom of god tonight this is
[46:40] a really good
[46:42] this is a quiz what's the scripture say
[46:46] who is the least in the kingdom of god
[46:54] for the most part it's a preacher
[46:58] huh it says somebody that says something
[47:01] and then doesn't do it
[47:03] i can get the scriptures he says
[47:05] somebody that says something and then
[47:06] doesn't do it
[47:08] that's the least in the kingdom of god
[47:09] jesus said
[47:14] huh pretty pretty good for us isn't it
[47:16] because we preach a lot
[47:18] so we have to live up to it but listen
[47:22] here listen he says he says if you
[47:25] desire to be the first
[47:28] let me put it in the same full language
[47:30] the same shall be
[47:31] last of all in other words if you want
[47:34] to be first
[47:35] you got to be last
[47:39] and servant
[47:43] of the good people or the richie people
[47:45] or whatever
[47:46] some people no no no no all
[47:49] in other words you're under everybody
[47:56] hey not very many people i know want to
[47:58] be the least that they want to be
[48:00] the bottom they want to be everybody's
[48:06] huh that bum out there
[48:10] huh be his servant you want me to be a
[48:14] bomb servant
[48:17] how about a flea bitten mangy doll god
[48:21] on the street
[48:24] huh be his servant
[48:29] brother branham was remember he picked
[48:30] him up off the road took him home and
[48:32] cleaned him up
[48:35] the mighty great prophet of god cleaning
[48:37] up a mangy fully bitten dog
[48:42] he became servant of all so if you want
[48:45] to be great in the kingdom of god
[48:47] you have to begin to serve people
[48:51] amen i hope tonight that we get a good
[48:56] view that
[48:58] as you serve somebody else you serve god
[49:02] how many believe that as you serve
[49:05] somebody else
[49:06] because god how many knows that's where
[49:07] god lives god lives in people
[49:14] oh boy i was gonna save this for last
[49:15] but can i say it
[49:18] how many of those that sometimes as
[49:20] parents beat the
[49:21] liver out of our kids sometimes we're
[49:25] maybe too rough with them
[49:27] we might offend them we better be just
[49:29] in what we do because remember
[49:31] one time billy ball beat his kid or
[49:32] something brother bam got back he says
[49:34] i'm getting away from you
[49:35] because the angel of the lord didn't
[49:36] away like the way you treated that kid
[49:41] amen i mean believes even your children
[49:44] the way that you
[49:44] treat your children you have to be
[49:47] careful about
[49:48] because there's angels watching them and
[49:50] most of us
[49:51] have gotten we've most of us got raised
[49:54] that
[49:55] boy i'll tell you what you do wrong and
[49:57] you're going to remember it for weeks
[50:01] sometimes we we it took people we took
[50:04] our kids our kids a lot of times they
[50:05] were
[50:06] you know i don't know they were you know
[50:08] maybe not quite as good as a dog
[50:12] come on folks what i'm saying is we
[50:14] don't we you know it was really rough
[50:17] in other words we were too far over the
[50:19] other way it's what i'm saying
[50:21] because you got to have that love and
[50:22] that affectionate care i forget to
[50:25] what does the bible say you know about
[50:27] uh not pushing your kids to wrath and so
[50:30] forth isn't that right
[50:31] because we're responsible for that too
[50:35] but i said that to say this also you
[50:37] know with us
[50:38] relationship comes right down this is
[50:39] where it comes right down to
[50:41] that is in our marriages the way we
[50:44] treat our husband
[50:46] huh the way we treat our wife
[50:49] is the way we treat christ
[50:56] amen brother byler preach it that's the
[50:58] truth
[50:59] amen so because sometimes we let our
[51:02] spouses become so common to us
[51:04] huh we'll come to church and praise god
[51:07] but
[51:08] comes home then we don't treat them
[51:09] right no that ain't right
[51:11] the most direct effect that your
[51:14] christianity gonna be
[51:15] is towards your spouse the way he treats
[51:17] your spouse
[51:20] amen
[51:23] anyway i kind of want to save for down
[51:24] the road but that's the truth it comes
[51:26] down that far
[51:28] because god cares about how we treat one
[51:31] another let me see there let me go on
[51:33] he shall be servant of all now notice
[51:36] two things he says
[51:38] if you want to be first in the kingdom
[51:40] then be
[51:41] last in other words think of yourself as
[51:44] the least
[51:45] right become servant of all
[51:48] and he took a child verse 36 if you
[51:50] follow on me
[51:51] took a child and set him in the midst of
[51:53] them and when he had taken him in his
[51:54] arms
[51:55] he said unto them whosoever shall
[51:58] receive
[51:59] of such children in my name receiveth
[52:03] me amen
[52:07] and whosoever shall receive me
[52:11] me but him that sent me how many of
[52:14] these that's how it works
[52:16] when you the way that you treat a child
[52:18] of god
[52:19] is the way you treat jesus and the way
[52:21] you treat jesus is the way you would
[52:23] have treated the father
[52:24] god himself not that jesus isn't
[52:28] but it reflects you understand
[52:31] so there it is
[52:34] down in verse let's jump down to verse
[52:43] well let me read this because i read i
[52:45] said something about this sunday
[52:47] and i didn't know if i felt just a
[52:48] little pushback but i want to read it
[52:51] and john answered him saying
[52:52] master we saw one casting out devils in
[52:55] thy name
[52:55] and he followeth not us and we forbad
[52:58] him
[53:00] hey because he followed not us
[53:04] huh we get to where somebody ain't my
[53:07] religion
[53:07] somebody ain't like me being in watch
[53:11] out
[53:13] they forbad him don't you go preaching
[53:15] gee we got jesus here
[53:17] you ain't a part of us and jesus said
[53:21] forbid him not for there is no man that
[53:24] shall
[53:25] do a miracle in my name that can lightly
[53:28] speak evil of me amen for he that is not
[53:31] against us
[53:32] on our part then he goes back on the
[53:35] subject
[53:35] for whosoever shall give unto give unto
[53:39] you
[53:39] a cup of water to drink in my name
[53:43] because ye belong to christ verily i say
[53:46] unto you
[53:47] he shall not lose his
[53:50] reward
[53:54] what if i say all kinds of evil things
[53:56] against you and this that or the other
[53:57] and
[53:58] wicked things never make it right do you
[54:00] think i'll be accountable
[54:03] you better believe it
[54:06] you speak against the son of man you
[54:09] know
[54:09] even there he said you know he will be
[54:11] forgiven you but you speak against the
[54:13] holy ghost working in his people
[54:15] that'll be a different story you can't
[54:18] say one word against one person
[54:20] or do one thing against any of god's
[54:23] children but that god is watching
[54:26] amen you can't give him a cup of water
[54:30] here here's a cup of water and you won't
[54:33] lose your reward
[54:35] whether it's good or whether it's bad
[54:39] amen and whosoever shall offend one of
[54:43] these
[54:44] little ones that believe in me it were
[54:47] better for him that a
[54:48] millstone were hanged about his neck
[54:52] and that he were cast into the sea
[54:58] [Music]
[55:00] i'm thinking there's another scripture
[55:01] that says it
[55:06] in matthew 18 i know there's one
[55:10] talking about this also
[55:13] verse 6 18 6 he says whosoever shall
[55:17] offend one of these little ones which
[55:18] believe in me he were better for him
[55:20] than a millstone were hanged about his
[55:21] neck
[55:22] and that he would drown into the depth
[55:23] of the sea woe unto the world
[55:26] because of offenses he says for it must
[55:30] needs be
[55:30] that offenses will come but woe to that
[55:34] man
[55:34] by whom the offense comes
[55:40] amen there's your judgment as you do
[55:43] to my children you'd do unto me
[55:48] if you offend one of my little children
[55:51] amen woe to that person
[55:54] how many believes that god has had his
[55:56] people all down through the ages
[55:59] those who were for those people were
[56:01] blessed
[56:02] those who are against god's people
[56:06] woe unto them
[56:10] amen does everybody get a picture that
[56:12] you want to really
[56:13] be careful how you treat god's people
[56:16] what you say about each other what you
[56:18] do
[56:18] to each other how you treat one another
[56:21] amen
[56:24] listen to this christian friends of mine
[56:26] i'm as sincere as i know how to be
[56:28] brother ma'am says
[56:29] because some of those people it's
[56:31] somebody's mother
[56:33] perhaps he understands somebody's mother
[56:36] now and if that
[56:37] was my mother and some man was praying
[56:39] for my mother i'd sure want to be a
[56:41] sincere
[56:42] i'd want him to be sincere because
[56:45] brother brown says and as
[56:47] i do to god's people
[56:51] i am serving
[56:54] god i mean believe that
[56:58] as you serve god's people
[57:02] you serve god
[57:05] let that sink in as we
[57:08] serve one another we serve
[57:12] god
[57:15] as we love one another
[57:19] we love god
[57:25] saint john first john 1 2 verse 9 says
[57:29] he that saith
[57:30] that he is in the light and hated this
[57:32] brother
[57:33] is in darkness even until
[57:36] now amen another place he says he that
[57:40] hateth his brother and says he's in lot
[57:42] is a liar
[57:44] you cannot love god
[57:47] and hate anybody not even your enemy
[57:54] that's right because when the love of
[57:56] god is india
[57:58] it doesn't go to just the church family
[58:00] or the neighbors
[58:02] is that right are those that do good to
[58:05] you
[58:06] but it's got to reach all the way out
[58:08] into those who don't do good to you
[58:10] persecute you and you've got to be able
[58:14] to
[58:15] what do good to them that despitefully
[58:18] do something good paul said put coals of
[58:21] fire on their head
[58:23] by coming back and doing something good
[58:26] blow their mind what i expected you to
[58:30] punch me for that
[58:32] you're going to help me with this
[58:38] amen that's the truth amen
[58:42] so listen that's right as i serve god's
[58:45] people i'm serving god
[58:47] because he says insomuch as you have
[58:49] done it unto the least
[58:50] of these my little ones you have done it
[58:54] unto me listen and this is just i didn't
[58:57] even know you had said this but this
[58:58] thoughts what
[58:59] prompted me to preach this tonight amen
[59:02] because i when i seen this i was like
[59:04] lord help me i don't know about you but
[59:05] lord help me
[59:07] amen listen here's a lovely thing
[59:12] as you serve one another
[59:15] you're serving god
[59:20] the love of god is in every christian
[59:22] heart to be kind to one another to
[59:24] forgive one another
[59:26] if you don't see the scriptures just
[59:28] like amen just
[59:29] pray for the other person let that
[59:32] person just love one another you'll find
[59:34] there's no greater evidence
[59:36] of a christian in the world than love
[59:40] isn't that the truth by this shall the
[59:43] world know
[59:44] that you are my disciples if you have
[59:47] love
[59:48] one for another
[59:51] amen don't you just don't that just make
[59:54] you feel good
[59:56] we have pledged ourselves anew knowing
[59:58] that in our hearts
[59:59] we have been quickened from the dead
[1:00:01] don't that make you feel good oh my
[1:00:02] i love you with undying love listen love
[1:00:05] one another
[1:00:06] for you cannot dislike your brother who
[1:00:09] you have seen
[1:00:10] and say that you love god
[1:00:14] well i really don't like that guy but i
[1:00:16] love
[1:00:17] jesus come on folks don't work that way
[1:00:20] right praise the lord
[1:00:26] how many knows what eternal life really
[1:00:28] is let's go over it again
[1:00:30] what eternal life is and this will be a
[1:00:32] challenge for us
[1:00:34] at evening like tabernacle everybody out
[1:00:36] there this will be a challenge for us
[1:00:38] because we are living in an
[1:00:39] age and i'm sure we're all guilty
[1:00:43] of what i'm fixing to read that we are
[1:00:46] living in an age when everybody is kind
[1:00:47] of out for their self
[1:00:49] that's right everybody kind of watches
[1:00:52] out for themselves
[1:00:53] we don't know till that the neighbor's
[1:00:55] dead until we see it in the favor
[1:00:58] right listen jesus never lived for
[1:01:01] himself his life was spent for others
[1:01:03] that's perfectly eternal life
[1:01:05] when you say you go to church and you do
[1:01:07] good things that's fine
[1:01:09] but when you live your life to yourself
[1:01:12] you haven't got eternal life
[1:01:16] eternal life is living for others
[1:01:21] amen brother brandon was talking to his
[1:01:24] friend
[1:01:24] doc an old friend of his they were back
[1:01:27] they were both in their 50s and he was
[1:01:29] there and he says how are you doing bill
[1:01:31] and i said oh pretty fair i suppose doc
[1:01:33] i said yourself
[1:01:34] he says oh i got a lot of patience said
[1:01:36] i got 15 examinations this afternoon
[1:01:39] and i said well that's good as long as
[1:01:41] the examinations isn't finding nothing
[1:01:43] wrong
[1:01:44] and we got to talking about back when we
[1:01:46] were boys and i said well doc
[1:01:47] i don't know just how long i'm going to
[1:01:49] be around we're both in our 50s
[1:01:52] he says that's true bill and i said but
[1:01:54] all these years about 31 years of
[1:01:56] ministry now
[1:01:57] i have kept my heart prepared for that
[1:02:00] hour when he comes
[1:02:01] so it doesn't matter when he comes and
[1:02:04] so he said that is true
[1:02:06] and i said the greatest thrill i have
[1:02:10] is living for others
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:22] living for others and he said that's
[1:02:24] what makes life real
[1:02:26] it's when you not what you can do
[1:02:29] accomplish for yourself
[1:02:31] but what you can do for others see
[1:02:34] that's what
[1:02:35] you're really that's when you're really
[1:02:36] living and listen to this
[1:02:39] i've read this before but i'd like to
[1:02:40] read it again and if there happens to be
[1:02:43] someone among us
[1:02:44] who has never tried to do that let me
[1:02:47] put
[1:02:48] it this way for us who have tried it
[1:02:50] know that it's good
[1:02:51] let's try it a little more
[1:02:55] that's me lord i sure i'm so busy with
[1:02:58] my stuff
[1:02:59] i don't think enough about others
[1:03:03] and their needs how many can say that
[1:03:06] with me
[1:03:07] i think so much about my stuff i hardly
[1:03:10] ever think about
[1:03:11] others needs and if you really want a
[1:03:13] blessing start
[1:03:14] doing that listen what he says never try
[1:03:17] that
[1:03:18] try to live for somebody else give that
[1:03:20] a try
[1:03:21] and just see how much more life holds
[1:03:23] for you
[1:03:24] when you will not live for what you can
[1:03:27] get yourself
[1:03:28] out of life but what you can give
[1:03:31] someone else
[1:03:32] in life and you'll find that it's more
[1:03:35] blessed than all of the riches
[1:03:37] that can be thought of when you can try
[1:03:40] to make life's burdens
[1:03:41] just a little lighter for somebody else
[1:03:45] amen you just don't know the joy unless
[1:03:48] you've tried it once
[1:03:49] to do something for somebody else
[1:03:53] how many believes that serving god truly
[1:03:55] is
[1:03:56] as you serve one another as you love one
[1:03:58] another you serve christ
[1:04:02] and that brings me to thinking of 31
[1:04:04] years
[1:04:05] will be soon in the ministry of the lord
[1:04:07] and i guess every man thinks of
[1:04:08] sometimes
[1:04:10] of sometimes when he has to come to his
[1:04:12] last service
[1:04:13] come to that last hour and look back
[1:04:16] down the path
[1:04:17] and see what he has accomplished
[1:04:21] now i guarantee you you get in your 50s
[1:04:24] and you're going to have some of those
[1:04:26] thoughts
[1:04:30] folks i know that when you get older
[1:04:35] because i'm a little older now i'm
[1:04:36] almost 60 rather glenn i'm almost enough
[1:04:38] to be old enough to say
[1:04:40] i know what it's like to be a little
[1:04:41] older
[1:04:43] that's right i've got the authority to
[1:04:46] do so because
[1:04:47] i'm there i ain't got the authority to
[1:04:50] say well when you get 80 i'm not there
[1:04:51] yet
[1:04:52] for 70. when you get a little older
[1:04:54] those thoughts come to you
[1:04:56] you begin to reflect back and think
[1:04:58] about
[1:05:00] what has been accomplished what you've
[1:05:02] accomplished
[1:05:03] in your life and i know people
[1:05:07] i watch people and i won't mention names
[1:05:09] but i know people that
[1:05:10] get greatly disturbed and bothered by it
[1:05:14] right because all of that is going to
[1:05:18] catch up
[1:05:18] everything we've done catches up
[1:05:22] you think about it what you've done your
[1:05:24] life what you have done
[1:05:25] in your life amen you sure will
[1:05:29] to look down the path and see just
[1:05:31] what's been accomplished
[1:05:33] see what's going on have you did
[1:05:35] anything
[1:05:36] and as i have just said it's what you do
[1:05:39] other for others that counts
[1:05:41] i often wonder what it would be when i
[1:05:43] got to the end of my road
[1:05:45] which we don't know what time that will
[1:05:46] be none of us do so i was thinking about
[1:05:49] that looking
[1:05:50] back down along the trail where we've
[1:05:51] come through life we've seen the
[1:05:53] different hills
[1:05:54] the fire patches the rocks the hard
[1:05:58] places the smooth runnings
[1:06:01] and what i did in those kinds of times
[1:06:04] it'll all show up one of these days at
[1:06:06] the hour of my going away
[1:06:09] and it'll do that on each one of us
[1:06:12] we are all sure to do that it'll show up
[1:06:16] on each one when that time comes
[1:06:20] amen
[1:06:24] now another police brother branham said
[1:06:25] a couple things about
[1:06:27] that we ought to love one another but
[1:06:29] says no matter what anybody's done
[1:06:32] if they are wrong don't never build up a
[1:06:34] complex against that person
[1:06:37] you be sweet and kind remember god loved
[1:06:40] you when you were in sin
[1:06:41] and if the spirit of god's in you you
[1:06:43] will love the other person one he's
[1:06:46] wrong amen how many knows that most of
[1:06:49] the time when somebody's wrong we
[1:06:51] get upset with him we don't like him
[1:06:54] we say bad things about him that's the
[1:06:57] exact
[1:06:58] wrong thing to do you got to be able to
[1:07:01] love them
[1:07:02] when they're wrong amen
[1:07:05] because you won't be helping them if
[1:07:07] they're in the wrong and you don't like
[1:07:09] them
[1:07:09] pray for them and love one another and
[1:07:12] brother ben says this in a couple places
[1:07:15] one of them was humbled by self he
[1:07:17] remember listen
[1:07:18] he says surely after all these years on
[1:07:20] the field and around the world and
[1:07:22] seeing different things and the miracles
[1:07:24] and everything the prophet saw you know
[1:07:28] he says i ought to know a little bit
[1:07:30] about what gate to enter in at and if
[1:07:32] you want to get somewhere with god
[1:07:34] don't never let arrogant proud better
[1:07:37] than somebody else's spirit
[1:07:39] ever come around you i added a couple of
[1:07:42] those things in there let me read it the
[1:07:43] way he did
[1:07:44] don't never let an arrogant spirit ever
[1:07:47] come around you don't let no malice come
[1:07:49] in
[1:07:50] no matter what anybody's done even if
[1:07:51] you're wrong and so forth amen
[1:07:54] now he says above everything
[1:07:58] love god and love one
[1:08:02] another above everything
[1:08:06] is you gotta love people they're the
[1:08:08] hardest
[1:08:09] to love but that's exactly what he asked
[1:08:12] us to do because why
[1:08:14] when god shed his blood on calvary sure
[1:08:17] he
[1:08:17] redeemed the earth sure he did all of
[1:08:19] that but his main purpose for was for
[1:08:22] what
[1:08:23] for souls or people
[1:08:26] because they're the most valuable
[1:08:28] they're the greatest treasure that god
[1:08:30] has is people
[1:08:33] and he lives in people and i believe
[1:08:36] it's the most valuable thing it's what
[1:08:38] he's going to spend eternity with is
[1:08:40] people
[1:08:41] and we need to love one another again he
[1:08:45] says
[1:08:45] in christ the mystery of god he says
[1:08:49] love one another above
[1:08:50] everything love one another no matter
[1:08:53] what the devil tries to do
[1:08:55] amen and how bad he's remember he said
[1:08:57] we're one sweet group
[1:08:58] i mean you'll be you'll go along one day
[1:09:00] nice every year
[1:09:02] you'll have oh man you'll just
[1:09:03] everything will be going so smooth
[1:09:05] and then all of a sudden something will
[1:09:07] happen right
[1:09:08] that's the devil trying to come in and
[1:09:11] cause you to hate one another and
[1:09:12] everything else
[1:09:14] amen god the devil won't let it stay
[1:09:16] that way but better bam says you just
[1:09:17] stay
[1:09:18] loving and sweet and kind to one another
[1:09:22] amen because that's where it's all at
[1:09:26] amen praise the lord do you love the
[1:09:28] lord tonight
[1:09:31] well i don't know what time i started
[1:09:32] but i bet you anything that was 30 or 40
[1:09:34] minutes
[1:09:35] sure does go fast don't it amen
[1:09:39] so if you want to be the greatest in
[1:09:41] god's kingdom
[1:09:44] and serve everybody else become the
[1:09:46] servant
[1:09:47] of all the humblest of all don't think
[1:09:49] of yourself as somebody that has to be
[1:09:51] served
[1:09:51] but somebody that's there to serve
[1:09:53] somebody else
[1:09:55] to my my way of seeing it i say
[1:09:58] especially about myself and i'm sure
[1:09:59] you're there too is lord just help me to
[1:10:02] get in that frame of mind
[1:10:04] more after tonight than what i was
[1:10:08] when i came to church are you with me
[1:10:11] lord help me to get into that frame of
[1:10:13] mind
[1:10:14] that it's more important to serve
[1:10:16] somebody else
[1:10:17] to do something good to somebody else
[1:10:19] than it is to myself
[1:10:21] amen it's just god's life
[1:10:24] so if you will stand with me musicians
[1:10:26] if you come
[1:10:33] i just never really saw it that way i
[1:10:35] guess until this week
[1:10:37] when i got to thinking of how god said
[1:10:39] that really
[1:10:40] and the prophet even said he said as
[1:10:42] we're serving one another as we love one
[1:10:44] another
[1:10:45] we're loving and we're serving god it's
[1:10:47] the way that we do because that's where
[1:10:49] god dwells is in us
[1:10:50] amen sure it's obeying the commandments
[1:10:52] sure it's so
[1:10:53] you know if a man loves me he keeps my
[1:10:55] sure that's all part of it
[1:10:56] but i believe this is a great aspect
[1:10:58] that we definitely need
[1:11:00] to say god help me with let's bow our
[1:11:01] heads
[1:11:03] how many is guilty of not doing this of
[1:11:06] not really thinking about others
[1:11:08] the way that you should maybe your
[1:11:09] husband your wife your neighbor
[1:11:11] or whoever it might be i'm guilty i'm
[1:11:14] guilty of just
[1:11:15] living for myself too much
[1:11:18] and i need to stop start beginning to
[1:11:21] say god help me not to just live for
[1:11:23] myself
[1:11:24] but eternal life holy ghost life is
[1:11:27] living for others
[1:11:28] caring about others sharing the gospel
[1:11:31] whatever it might be just to be a help
[1:11:33] just somehow do something for
[1:11:35] god's people do something for god doing
[1:11:37] something for the neighbor just
[1:11:39] it's not doesn't gain us our entry to
[1:11:42] heaven we're saved by grace
[1:11:44] but it's what we want to do it's the way
[1:11:45] that god has told us to do
[1:11:47] and that's what we want to live like we
[1:11:48] want to live by the holy ghost
[1:11:51] and serve god by serving one another and
[1:11:53] loving one another
[1:11:55] and being kind lord jesus we ask god
[1:11:57] tonight that you which is blessed
