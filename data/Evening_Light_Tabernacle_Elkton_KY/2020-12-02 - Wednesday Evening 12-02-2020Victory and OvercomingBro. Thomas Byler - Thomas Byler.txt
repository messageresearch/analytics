just desire god that you'll bless the congregation and help me lord just to get out of the way bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart and father that which we you we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak on tonight we just ask god that you'd help us to say something that would be a blessing and a benefit that would be edifying to the body of christ lord that's our hearts desires just to be able to be a help father and a furtherance lord to someone god that needs strength lord and lord we just pray god that you just please bless every request that was mentioned earlier be with each one father in a special way and then we want to give you thanks and praise and honor and glory lord for all the times lord you've lifted us up that you've healed us that you've given us lord uh lord renewed strength when we couldn't hardly go any more father we thank you lord jesus for your precious word and for what it means to us and for who we are we ask god that you'll just bless the service now in jesus christ's name amen amen if you will turn the bibles to revelations take a familiar topic tonight and perhaps approach it just a little bit of a different angle revelations three the leader age verse 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither hot cold nor hot i would that word cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold or hot i will spew the out of my mouth because thou says i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint the eyes with isaiah of that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten besel us therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even though as i also overcame and am set down in my father's throne he didn't have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may god had his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated i want to just talk about overcoming tonight overcoming amen and i hadn't really intended to talk too much on some of this but as i was reading it it just kind of caught my attention amen and so um but i want to say first perhaps before we say mention a few things here is you know when i begin to meditate when i begin to think about overcoming it amen my thought went to first john the first chapter in verse 5. it says now this is the message we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light in him and in him is no darkness at all amen amen and if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ god's son cleanses us from all sin i got to thinking about how that jesus overcame all darkness amen jesus overcame all darkness everything that is of darkness amen such as temptations such as lust such as greed the lust of the eye the lust of the flesh the pride of life right he overcame all of that and it says that in him was no darkness at all so jesus christ displayed perfect light and we know that jesus christ was really the only one that ever could perfectly overcome he never was overcome by evil in any form or fashion that right he overcame perfectly and i'm not gonna go into it too much but i i really like how brother branham when he talked about jesus christ being the mighty conqueror is that right honey believes that jesus truly was the mighty conqueror he truly was the overcomer of all overcomers there was none like him nobody ever did but abraham talked about napoleon and how did he conquered i guess all the known world how he was such a mighty mighty warrior led such a mighty army but finally he came to his demise not only that but from what i understand he died as he drunk that right and so at 33 he dried as a drunk and so forth but then he said you know with jesus christ he overcame everything that there was to overcome and he died at 33 but he didn't die but he also rose again and then but y'all remember brother bam talking about the illustrating how that when he came forth you know on the third day resurrecting and so forth and amen he conquered death hell in the grave he conquered uh went down there and took the keys from the devil and come up you know and brought the old testament saints with him and he talked about going past the moon and the stars and went up to the pearly gates you know and the saints set open up ye everlasting gates let the king of glory come in you know and somebody on the inside shouting who is this king of glory amen he's the king he's mighty in battle amen the king of glory mighty in battle amen he had just did the greatest battle that you could ever have imagined amen i think of the song that says oh behold the mighty conqueror behold him in plain view for he is the mighty conqueror since he read the veil in two amen i think somebody's got to have a revelation to write a song about the mighty conqueror renting the veil in two well now that may seem shallow might sound insignificant or you might say well what in the world does the veil renting into have to do it with it but when you get to think about it you know i mean how many knows that that is what separated man and god amen a man couldn't go back behind that veil you couldn't approach the presence of god before but now since calvary and since the death of christ god rent it so that man could come back to almighty god so it was a really big deal it was a great thing when he the mighty conquer rent the veil in two amen it brought us back into fellowship with almighty god amen tonight i want to talk to you with the help of the lord a little bit we want to talk about amen you know how that we're overcoming darkness and our hearts desire is to be able to say like the scripture talks about jesus that in him wasn't any darkness at all it was all light and that's your heart's desire no doubt my heart desire is to get all the darkness out to overcome all darkness amen because i think if every one of us look at ourselves we still find a little darkness we still find places in our lives where we still need to overcome amen hopefully tonight you know no doubt every one of us sitting here probably don't have to think or search our hearts too long to know what area of our life it is that we need to overcome we might be able to say well i'll overcome that overcome this uh but yet you look at what you still need to overcome i got to thinking of how jesus hunted he conquered every darkness all the works of darkness you overcome it and over in romans i believe it is i want to go to over in romans i just ran across this paul said in the 13th chapter in verse 11 he says you know love or 10 love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of the sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness amen and let us put on the armor of light amen let us walk honestly as in the day not in writing and in drunkenness not in chamber and in wantingness not in strife and envying somebody knows that's just a few things that paul mentions that we're to overcome amen they were put aside they were put down and then we could go through many things we won't take the time because i want to talk to you about some other aspects but he talks about you know scripture talks about therefore lay aside all lying and let all lay aside this list alright let us put on the new man and take good rid of the old man is that right over in galatians say i believe it is amen and all of that is of course part of that darkness but i want to just start with this amen we're talking about how that we as human beings you know that in him was no darkness at all amen it's all life when we were born how many knows that we were born in darkness we're born in sin amen and we there's so much for us to overcome and i got to thinking of how how that god has allowed we has put us into this and causes us like brother branham says one place it just comes to mind he says you know uh you know if god just takes you and pushes you through something you know it's that's not really overcoming is that right amen and but he has to actually allow to go through it battle with it overcome and that's truly overcoming something that you struggle with something that you have to do battle with amen so we were certainly born amen on a and and i got to thinking about this course because we know that one thing about overcoming now now overcoming the the the very word overcoming the word very word overcome and we of course we know that's to be victorious over something they have the victory of something or uh to get the better of something is that right uh to have it under your feet to where once it was dominating you now here you are dominating it you have become stronger than what that is it is under your feet amen you aren't controlled by that anymore that's truly overcoming amen you know overcoming is something that is so much more than just a word it's kind of like love well yeah we've heard the lord love you know but how many knows that when you have love in your heart it's more to you than just a word it's god it's a presence it's something and it's the same way with overcoming you can talk about overcoming but amen if you are in the state of being heaven overcome that's a whole different story amen so overcoming now and i got to thinking about it you know and i thought well you know god has put us in this what i would call an obstacle course huh haven't we said many times that life uh this is a testing ground this world is a place of testing it's a testing ground and you know i think nowadays they have shows where they put people out in the wilderness drop them off with just the bare essentials and see if they can survive or not huh and that's kind of what we're in i mean we've been put out there we've been given essential tools to be able to survive now if you don't have those essential tools you'll never make it out you'll never make it back home huh but god certainly didn't put us in this without giving us the tools that we need to make it amen i was reading a quote by the brandon back there he was talking about he says you know he says what what riches what what would you ever trade for this for god and for salvation what what treasure is there out there that could ever compare to what we have tonight i mean there's he said there's absolutely nothing out there that compares to what we have amen isn't that saying a big old mouthful that's in a big old mouthful that there's absolutely nothing in the world that even comes close to having god and to have salvation and to know what it's like to be a son of god amen praise the lord nothing to compare amen so in this obstacle course what i would call obstacle course god puts loudest of course to come and to be in this world of darkness and to come into this world unsaved isn't that right to come as a sinner come into this dark world amen and let me just say this that we know that the overcomer now let me just say this while it comes to my mind we realize and i've said it before i want to say it again that we realize that in every church age god always said to him that overcometh will i grant this so there's always a reward for those that overcome and we realize that god is only going to share his throne with overcomers it's the only class of people that he's going to share his throne with his overcomers that's the only kind you have to be an overcomer amen [Music] i'll perhaps pick up on revelations there because as i was reading there uh it begins to tell you the things that you have to overcome didn't it lukewarmness i want you to be hot or cold you know to him it overcometh will i grant to sit with me so you know if you're cold or lukewarm not going to be there only if you're hot if you're going to be there and that right because he said i want you to overcome all that and on down and on down but i want to talk to you about paul because how many knows that paul said uh and let me see here in acts 20 we want to look at life as a obstacle course or a race all right paul looked at it as a race they were running isn't that right and one receives the prize amen there's a prize and as you know in every acts 20 and i'll go to the very scripture here in a minute no matter what it is there's always a prize you know and i don't know i guess it's great i guess it's great to get some kind of a trophy you know they go to the super bowl and they win the super bowl and they got this trophy you know what is it a big piece of metal wonderful all that work for a big piece of metal you know they really worked hard for that but we realized it's probably not so much about the metal as it is about being the top being the best having beat everybody i think that's a whole lot more than the actual prize they get because in my book it's not just too much maybe some ring you know ring on your finger i don't know maybe it's worth more than i think but to me it's just i'm not just to impress but there's always a prize for everything there's a prize isn't that right well the prize for overcoming for us is going to be to sit with him in the throne that's right and uh sometimes you know i don't know which is what what you know i guess in a i don't know where they what kind of perhaps only beauty contests or somewhere like that they would actually give you a crown that right in some places they actually give you a crown well she's the queen she's got the crown or whatever you know you know but in that case maybe the crown but you know we're looking for a crown right and our our reward for uh being overcomers couldn't also be a crown and paul paul talking here he was coming to the end of his life all right and y'all remember and i won't go to corinthians there where he talks about you know how the bible talks about how that you know you know that how that there's many that run in a race but one win is the prize you know therefore you know i keep under my body you know so that i wouldn't be cast away and so forth he kind of typed with running a race paul for some reason had that in his mind and so when he came close to coming to the end of his life in chapter 20 of acts he says and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there say that the holy spirit witnesses that in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me yeah so he realized that he's going to be bad when he gets there it isn't going to be easy bonds and affliction everybody was prophesying that you know it's not going to be good for you when you go there bonds afflictions and so forth but paul said but none of these things move me amen neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course amen so he said that it's a course like that you're running and i'm going to finish this course all right with joy and the ministry which i have received the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god now let's go to second timothy he once and against mentions this in second timothy as he wants to go and talks about the prize that he's getting and also you and i the prize that waits for us to finish this course to run this race to go through this obstacle course to overcome everything that we must overcome ii timothy 4 and verse 5 but watch down in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry for i am now ready to be offered in the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished the course i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown huh of righteousness amen now how many has heard that you'll receive a crown of huh life i mean it's hurting the crown of life that's right because i don't know for folks that you're actually going to have a crown all right there's a crown of righteousness and then there's the crown of life eternal amen eternal life is your crown that's what he's giving you that is your reward is eternal life the crown of life praise the lord all right a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but thank you paul i sure appreciate that huh that he had 100 confidence that he's going to finish his course he's going to overcome he's even overcoming death all of that it doesn't matter all right and he had confidence that he had finished it he had fought the good fight amen he had come to the end and that god that's a big word how many knows paul was pretty confident that he was going to receive a crown of righteousness amen which the lord the righteous judge wow shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that are scared because don't talk about the coming of the lord it scares us to death [Music] you reckon that's the group that's going to be getting the crown alive remember brother brown says brother brandon you gotta quit talking about the common law that scares people they've been like what what what scares people no he's in it out in this area why because you're looking for you're expecting him if it scares you there's something wrong somewhere in it right i dare say tonight but he said but unto all them also that love his appearing amen hallelujah praise the lord he's finally coming those who love his appearing praise be the lord so you see folks how that he talks about being a a course like something that you got to go through trials tribulation god has never promised us a flowery bed of ease amen no he certainly hasn't amen so i want to begin going down now talking about first of all how did we were born in darkness we were born with lots of darkness in us such as hate right such as emulation emulation wrath strife but the main thing the first of all the thing that i want to mention is that we were born condemned or damned is that right because those that believe not shall be damned so we were born in a damn condition it born born in a in a state of condemnation now you know that you cannot have confidence with condemnation because adam after he received that condemnation he went and hid in the bushes he couldn't face god anymore i'm scared fear come in so that's part of the things that you and i have to overcome is condemnation huh where is it over there in saint john i believe it is talks about he says if a heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards god you can't have confidence towards god you die you're not gonna be a confident person under condemnation you can't have real confidence under condemnation so the first thing we got to do is get rid of the condemnation the damnation the sin the guilt how i mean it's all darkness it's all things that he made us this this obstacle of course that he's given us that you got to overcome you're going to have to overcome guilt and condemnation amen and you know people in the old testament never could overcome it they could never overcome it why because jesus hadn't died yet the bulls and ghosts that just covered their sin it did not change their nature at all it did not change their desires at all they went right back out there amen and did the same things again because they had you know you one thing you can't fight is your nature god has to change our nation amen oh praise the lord [Applause] so we realize let me see here first god had to give us a weapon he had to give us something that would cause us not to be condemned anymore amen how many knows that come through forgiveness through jesus christ amen i want to look at um first john 5. first john 5 and we'll read a few scriptures here so here's the avenue here's our first weapon here's our first way of overcoming amen whosoever believeth that jesus is born is the christ is born of god oh wow you know how many people believe or i'm going to say it this way you know how many people say they believe that jesus was the son of god and another place to justify this brother brahm talk about how did no man speaking can't call jesus the christ but by the holy ghost in other words you don't know jesus unless you've got him in here you just know him by knowledge that's not knowing him you can't jesus call jesus to christ but by the holy ghost so whosoever believeth i mean truly believeth right truly believe it with your heart the bible says that you're born of god amen and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him okay because paul was talking about haunted you can't say you love god and hate your brother now you're a liar if you say that you love god and hate your brother you are still in darkness and the light isn't in there amen how many knows that when you truly get baptized and have the holy ghost it makes you love everybody makes you love everybody it does does do it amen i don't care if they take you out there and hang you on a tree it'll still make you love them and say father forgive them that's just the spirit of god and then listen even and especially the household of god because he many times said he that talks about if he that loveth is hateth his brother right those that are others that are in christ right part of the church of god and you hate them that are begotten and that's what he was saying everyone that loveth him that begat or is begotten also loveth him that is begotten of him in other words if god saved me in that right you're gonna it's gonna cause you to love those that are begotten also of god by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for whatsoever is born of god whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith now who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god so how many knows there is absolutely no way in the world no buddha no hindu no no nobody out there there is nothing out there huh nowhere on the internet tonight if anybody was a listen listen you're going to hear it that there is absolutely no salvation in any other name there is no uh how does that say it now there is no name given under heaven whereby there is not another there we go acts there is not another name given under heaven whereby you must be saved you can try it you can try every other one that you can but it'll never happen jesus says i am the way to truth in the life and no man comes to the father but by me the only way you'll ever overcome is through jesus christ not by joining church not by turning a new page not by anything else only through christ are you ever going to overcome anything amen tommy is glad for that only by being in christ only it's the only hope that you have is jesus christ amen let's talk for a minute about overcoming genetics all right overcoming is a genetics thing right it's a genetic thing and i thought about a story and i think i remember brother brad one of his first messages that i remember him preaching about was something about a horse and racing a long time ago i remember i don't know just whatever he said but i know what it probably had to do a little bit about genetics but i thought about just making my own story up tonight and that is let's just take there's a horse person that loves horses and he loves racing horses but all he's got is a bunch of poor quality horses that won't bring but about two thousand dollars three thousand dollars you know and one time one time you know it happens to be that one of these horses he knows when it's born it's special i mean this horse is extra big but yet it's sleek and when it runs it goes like lightning and he trains and he works on this horse like he wouldn't believe all right and somebody comes and perhaps wants to buy a horse and say i'll give you 3 000 for that horse no i'm about to take him to the kentucky derby and try him out and he goes to kentucky derby he can't try it out he makes it try outs or whatever sure enough and this horse in the real race blows everybody else away all right and that horse goes from a worth of about three thousand dollars four thousand dollars to about two million dollars how many knows after the win it jumps majorly right they offer him a million dollars two million whatever no he goes back home takes the same stallion same bear breeds more uses that one and breeds more and that right and now not no more his horse is worth about two or three that people come and offer him just for the babies i'll give you half a million why because they know that he's going to make millions they want the genetics of that horse because that's what really makes the difference is because that horse beat everybody he was fasting and then they went to genetics all right muhammad beefs that's the way it is with you and i you and i were so to speak as brother branham would have put it when we were in the world when we were born in sin it says we were dead in sins and trespasses not fit for a 25-cent bullet it would take to shoot us well isn't that what the public of god said some people are didn't he some folks they're so low they fit the clean bullet would take to shoot him with that's pretty low but you take that person and get them salvation that right you get them salvation you connect them with god and all of a sudden they become a son or a daughter of god and now they're worth ten thousand worlds what makes the difference the difference is that you truly weren't fit to live not fit to kill is that right going to hell gonna be destroyed no good whatsoever but now that you're a part of god you become worth ten thousand worlds that's the way that it's a believer because why because there's something that's in him now i want to tell you something i truly believe this that if you are ever going to be an overcomer it'll have to be in your genetics not your genetics of biler huh but in your genetics of where you truly come from i mean knows that but about that we are a seed gene of almighty god for you to ever be with god or to be a part of god you had to be with god or in god before the first stardust was ever created god had to think of you you had to be a part of god isn't that right and when the inner genetics pulls out when when that comes because that woman at the well she then had five husbands now we know that brother brown says that if a woman goes out and marries another man after being divorced you know right she forfeits her rights to heaven i don't understand it all but he said five times you've had five husbands huh and here what happened but abram said there was a gene seed down the inside there was a gene seed down on the inside and she recognized the word of god and it come forth and she was not just a low-life prostitute anymore she was a daughter of god that you're going to get to see when you get over there i believe huh worth ten thousand worlds but it had to be in there to begin with can i give you a scripture i'll give you a scripture confirmation because everything has to be backed up by scripture how many believes that i'm going to go all the way to genesis all the way to genesis to prove that overcoming comes by genetics spiritual genetics genesis 22 and verse 15 and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said i myself have i sworn saith the lord for because the thou has done this thing remember how he was fixing to kill his son and he was going to kill him even though he didn't understand why but he just had faith god said it didn't do it because of what he did the lord said because god has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thy only son that in blessing i will bless thee amen and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is by the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy brother branham came back and he says every son that is born of god every seed of abraham that is your promise that you're going to be a winner you are going to be an overcomer most people give up i mean oh job was one of them and he got down way low until his wife just thought man you are so miserable i don't want to see you so miserable just curse god and die and get it over with his own wife yeah he was so miserable she didn't want to see him suffer like that he said thou speak is like a foolish woman what was that that was that tea down on the inside is that right brother branham after god took his wife after god took his child for him disobeying he was down there at the hospital god put a black sheep in front of him wouldn't hear his prayer absolutely blocked him off huh give him the cold shoulder and the devil tried to tell you he don't love you that's what he tried to tell me there's a god but he don't love you hear you just asking please not my shared rose not my little baby ripping his heart out and god just put a black seat and refuse it and the devil came to him tried to tell him see he don't love you [Music] you know and he said he was just about to say if that's how that's god's going to be that's how god's gonna be huh he's just about and he says you know the genetics kicked in and they're right and he says the lord gave him to me the lord has taken away blessed be the name of the lord did you know sometimes that is exactly that's actually brother bannon worship the lord the brother branham was worshiping the lord right there because if you go back and read job it says and job worshipped the lord saying the lord has taken the lord is given and the lord is taken away blessed be the name of the lord that's how you worship the lord by giving god the glory anyway amen how many believes that's the way it is with every son and daughter of god when you come down to that place huh didn't brother braham say every son of god comes to that place and i believe he was territed well or one of them wrote the songs and he talks about how that every son comes down to that place amen we all come to that place god brings us all to that place in our christian walk sometime during our christian walk he brings us all the way to the bottom to find out what we're made of to see whether we're overcomer or whether we'll walk away whether we're one of god's children or whether we're really not so i say this evening i believe that it has to be in our genetics to overcome it has to be god because listen how many knows he talks about that seed and and galatians talks about who who a child of abraham is amen now we are all children of abraham by having the faith that abraham had how many believes you got the same faith abraham had we got the same faith that abraham had amen did i ever finish that i don't think i finished that i may have but we're going to read it again first john 5 yeah we read it again listen whatsoever is born of god verse 4 overcometh the world amen so that's another absolute scripture that tells you that if you're born of god you're going to overcome the world the only way you're going to overcome the world is if you're born of god for whatever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith amen amen we were telling elena and emeline yesterday was it this morning we were having devotions we were reading and we're talking about the wisdom of god and you know what the true wisdom is how did solomon talk about wisdom and so forth and then we talked about how the talmud says you know the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom because when solomon talked about wisdom he talked about it'll deck you with gold it'll do this it'll do that wisdom if you're just smart man it'll get you a long way you you're right and over generally speaking knowledge and wisdom truly gets you a long way but at the end of it all he says you know the fear of the lord is the beginning of the wisdom because if you don't fear god you really don't have any kind of a foundation for your life there's really no foundation if people don't believe in god why do you think people are just going there they're like a piece of cloth that is unfolding just falling all to pieces societies falling to pieces people painting their face and doing all kinds of crazy things they all falling apart because they have no foundation because they don't have any faith in god truly how many truly can say like the bible says our victory is our faith our faith is our victory because having faith in god it's what begins to help you it's what causes you to be able to come is to believe on the lord jesus christ oh how simple if the world could just realize that that's your answer amen isn't that something anybody ask any question hey i've got a problem i've got a problem i got a problem hey guess what christ is the answer amen and we certainly were born with problems god allowed us in this obstacle course to have problems i mean any obstacle course that's supposed to be hard to do people can't do it this that or the other i mean those they'll make these obstacle course where you got to walk on a little board you got to jump on one balloon to the other and the other and you've got to do all this stuff you got to go to be a sanity saturday well that's about what life's all about man you got to do all kinds of stuff to try to make it through folks you gotta you gotta deal with betrayal you gotta deal with depression you gotta deal with hate and fear and all kinds of things that you gotta deal with all kinds of hard things that you gotta deal with amen one of the first things you've got to go through and that is to get rid of condemnation and guilt through jesus christ i may believe that he's willing to forgive us of our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins if we ask for it he's more willing to forgive us of our sins than we are willing to forgive each other because i guarantee you any one of us would have a hard time forgiving each other 490 times in a day we'd have a hard time with that we have a problem with that but yet that's what jesus said a person comes and genuinely pray repent guess how many times we're supposed to forgive each other amen and so god is very gracious he takes that away so now notice instead of condemnation amen light comes into our soul and we begin to have confidence it begins to give us structure amen and because of this condemnation that we have sorrow and fear also came in isn't that right you know people you might say well all right tell you what brother i don't have any darkness i'm full of light i have i'm i'm a complete overcomer and you're still complete sorrow and in fear huh the bible says that perfect love casts out fear huh i mean sometimes we get through anxiety overcome anxiety anxiety nervousness and all kinds of things that can come upon us only jesus christ can take you through that only christ can help you through these things i'm going to mention my brother-in-law david you know he always thought about these people that get all nervous and have these nerve problems you know they're just a little bit there's something wrong with him david was a tough guy he's one of us old-timers i believe you got to be tough you know you got to be tough work hard you know but come to find out later in his life he got so nervous he was struggling with nerve so bad he was making deals walking up and down the road couldn't hardly function maybe you say lord jesus don't you ever let me not have compassion for somebody that's going through a nervous spell or something like that he said that stuff's real nothing to play with don't let me not have compassion for people spirits that get on people things that cause people to get that way isn't that right but yet your only hope sometimes is to overcome fear sorrow disappointment how many knows that in life you're gonna face disappointing things very disappointing things things that can absolutely deflate you amen feel like there is no hope because how many knows the opposite of disappointment so forth is hope that's right discouragement but we're filled with hope instead brother bam said you know this world is full of dissatisfied people the hospitals are full of this side there's so many people that are dissatisfied people are not happy huh but if you've overcome that then what are you i'm satisfied with just a cottage pillow a little silver into little gold how many is happy no matter what you have be happy i mean look if you know am i people are not happy how many believes that that's something we need to overcome our droopy faces we need to overcome our droopy faces what is it preachers tell us all the time well if you have so much joy how about notifying my face that's right it just comes from the inside out you know right i mean needs more joy right more peace more satisfaction folks it's easy to deal with somebody that's satisfied it's hard to deal somebody it's not satisfied amen overcome bitterness and hatred how many knows it's easy to be bitter poor bitterness wants to grab you if you've been done wrong it's so easy to let bitterness get in your heart and from bitterness spawns the evil spirits of hatred and from the evil spirits of hatred spawns the wicked spirit of murder that's right remember it just started out with jealousy with cain and it ended up with murder all right how many please it's all things we have to overcome in this obstacle course overcoming because only those are overcomers will grant to sit with me or do you reckon you're going to sit by jesus there and say brother i'll tell you what but i hate that guy over there you let's get into heaven i really don't like that other person over there you let come on that no he's not gonna have around people that are bitter amen no so guess what we have to overcome bitterness because of issues things that we face a lot of times it's people huh how we're different we're different sometimes just because of that don't get me started i was talking to jonathan at uh golden rule was just witnessing a little bit and we was talking about how that i told him i said you know people's dissatisfied and it's people never want to give a take account for their self but the hardest thing the hardest thing i told him for me and i'm sure it's for you it's to actually see your own fault it's so easy to see everybody else's fault but so many times we don't see our own fault i don't know about you but my hands are up i have to say lord show me where i'm too loud mouth show me where i'm too unconscious un inconsiderate i'm too rude show me where you know and galore begin to show you hey you know you're a pretty rough cut guy you need to have a little bit more gentleness about you when you preach and tear people up make sure you do it in love not out of anger or whatever you know and just all kinds of things he'll show you about yourself if you'll take notice otherwise i'm right and you're wrong that's just how it is that's total blindness to your own fault that's how you think when you're totally blind it ain't never your fault it's always somebody else's fault amen but the holy spirit will say well maybe he reacted that way because of what i did wow what a revelation what a good thought now you're ready to get somewhere amen praise the lord let me just jump right to the end would that be all right with two more thoughts and all right one of them is overcoming as a church all right how many of those that we'll just put it in there where where it says i would that that were cold or hot isn't that right brother bam says sometimes you go into churches and it feels like it's 20 below zero that's cold because i don't know about you but this morning 22 was gold 20 below zero how many knows when you get into the house of god you like to feel a little warmth and what is that warmth that one that warmth is amen when you go after service and you shake people's hands and you're friendly or you just ignore everybody and go on a street be lying right out to your car you ain't talking to nobody that's not real warm right there right you come in here it can be in the way that the people saying huh it's in the people's attitude it's in the holy spirit am i right the holy spirit you can sense it you can feel it amen you can hear it in the amens you can hear it in the hallelujah that's right you can see it in the smiles the warmth we have to overcome lukewarmness as a church we have to overcome things that will drag you down that'll cause the spirit not to really freely move amen and then the last one is going to be a pretty good one are you ready for this we're going to bring in politics for just a second have you ever heard people make this mark something about when they go low we go high have you ever heard that how many heard that one one person boy congratulations y'all don't look at the news very much do you you probably better off for it but some politicians they're talking about well when they go and they just talk trash about somebody not knock some people down and stuff we're gonna go high you know we're gonna be above all that yeah that's right out there i ain't seen a lot of going high folks i ain't seen no going high but nobody that's not picking any kind of party but there ain't nobody out there i know of lately that has gone high now they've all gone low they haven't overcome they haven't been better than the other person and this is found in romans let me preach to the world for a minute let's go to romans let's talk about going high what does going high mean well it means overcoming going low that's what it means all right it's all about overcoming and perhaps doing the opposite of what the other person is doing right do the opposite of what the other person is here should we uh let's go to the punch line first so that we will know what we're talking about read romans 12 and 21 with me be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good that's what it's supposed to mean about going high and they all ought to practice it be a better world amen so let's find out what this not being overcome by evil but overcoming evil is going high all right let's start with uh verse 16. start somewhere be of the same mind one towards another mind not high things but condescend to men of lowest they be not wise in your own conceits now recompense no man evil for evil huh they say something bad about you what are you supposed to do say something good about them whoo what the world that would be huh provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as life in you live peaceably with all amen dearly beloved avenge not yourselves well i'll get that person amen but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord therefore if the enemy hunger feed him i may believe this is truly overcoming somebody smacks you on the jeep jesus said turn the other one also huh what is that that's overcoming evil don't be uh overcome by evil but overcome evil with doing good when your enemy hungers feed him when he thirsts give him drink for in doing so thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head be not overcome by evil but overcome evil with good amen praise the lord god bless you in closing stand with me musicians will come i want to read you one more scripture as you're doing that and i want to talk to you about the final enemy that we're going to overcome how many believes that there is perhaps the greatest fight the greatest battle is still ahead of all of us and that is facing death itself how many believes that when you come down to the door of death it's going to be a big battle of whether you overcome that i remember brother joe hendrickson i remember him on his deathbed being there and sometimes he said he says brother byler fear wants to grip me he wants to be scared of what lays ahead but he says he just commits it to the lord no he don't have to be afraid why he knew where he was going he was ready to go he had to overcome even the fear of death itself paul said in first corinthians 15 and verse 54 so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory oh death paul says where is thy sting oh grave where is your victory how many believes that the for the longest time everybody that would come down to that door of death had to be scared they were they were fearful it was a scary thing but not so with paul not so with eva's fault for us not so with many many people and even brother braham said after seeing the other side he's no more scared of death than nothing is that right why because calvary jesus christ took this thing of death out and even paul said o grave where is your victory how many believes death and the grave has been robbed of its victory that's right we have the victory now the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my beloved brethren listen everybody be steadfast unbelievable always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain we're not doing this folks for nothing amen with our heads bowed eyes closed how many in here would say brother byler i still believe that i have some darkness that i want to see out of my life i need more victories in my life think of that obstacle that's in front of you think of whatever it is that you want to overcome raise your hand to the lord jesus christ and say lord you know what i'm thinking you know what i have need of and you know what i want to overcome and i believe that by faith in you father and committing it to you and completely committing it to you i will have the victory i believe it right now god bless those hands god bless the hands all over the building mind's up lord jesus now you see our hands you are present you see every heart you know every thought you know what it each person thought in their mind of what the victory that they have need of lord for tonight we have come to service god and father in our hearts we want to say god that we want to be to where we can believe and know that there is no darkness in us at all that's our heart's desire we don't want any darkness lord we want to cast off all the unfruitful works of darkness lord jesus we ask god that you would make an your abode in our hearts father and we may go from here this wednesday night lord jesus all of our sins forgiven lord jesus no condemnation in our heart joy in our heart satisfaction in our life lord no condemnation we ask god that you give each and every one the remainder of this week to be a lot better than the first half was and father then we are just watching and waiting and we're just looking and we're just not gonna know that father you're gonna give us that victory over the other dark thing in our life that is bothering us that's tormenting us and that we need to overcome and father you've seen the hands he raised it to you and i ask father that you help each one here to have complete victory in their lives in jesus christ's name amen and amen oh victory in
