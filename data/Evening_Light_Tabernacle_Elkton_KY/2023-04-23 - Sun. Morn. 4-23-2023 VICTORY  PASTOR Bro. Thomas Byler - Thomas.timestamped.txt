[19:21] Brother Brad would you prayed
[19:39] technology to you Lord and our
[19:41] relationship with you Lord
[19:47] increase the word the singing the song
[19:50] on worship Lord
[19:52] we love you appreciation
[19:55] okay uh children can be dismissed to
[19:58] Sunday school
[20:00] and
[20:01] let's open our Bibles to
[20:04] Psalms 108.
[20:24] thank you
[20:27] oh God my heart is fixed I will sing and
[20:32] give praise even with my glory
[20:40] I will praise thee O Lord among the
[20:43] people and I will sing praises unto thee
[20:46] among the Nations
[20:48] foreign
[20:55] Ted o God above the heavens and thy
[20:58] Glory above all the Earth
[21:07] God hath spoken in his Holiness I Will
[21:12] Rejoice I will divide check and and meet
[21:15] out the valley of sirkoth
[21:27] is my washbot over Edom where I cast out
[21:32] my shoe over philistia will I Triumph
[21:41] well not thou o God who has cast us off
[21:45] and will not thou o God who go forth
[21:47] with our hosts
[21:54] though God we shall do valiantly for he
[21:58] it is that shall tread down our enemies
[22:01] amen
[22:05] brother Brian
[22:14] you may be seated
[22:23] I like that 12th verse in Psalms give us
[22:25] help from trouble for Venus the help of
[22:28] man we do need to rely on God all the
[22:31] time
[22:31] if we'll go
[22:34] scripture
[22:35] uh let's see
[22:39] we'll go to Genesis
[22:41] six
[22:57] and five
[23:06] and God saw the wickedness of man was
[23:08] great in the earth and that every
[23:10] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[23:12] was only evil continually and you
[23:15] repented and it repented the Lord that
[23:17] he had made man
[23:19] on the earth and it grieved him at his
[23:21] heart
[23:22] and the Lord said I will destroy men
[23:25] whom I created from the face of the
[23:26] Earth both man and Beast and the
[23:29] creeping thing and the fowls of the air
[23:30] for it repenteth me that I have made
[23:32] them
[23:34] that's very sad in Scripture that Irene
[23:38] we want to continue to eat but Noah
[23:41] found Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[23:43] amen
[23:45] that's where we want to be found
[23:47] to find Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[23:49] we'll skip over here to Genesis
[23:53] it's 18.
[23:55] I'm going to start
[23:57] in verse 20 it's just a
[24:00] talking about right before
[24:03] the angels went down to Sodom there
[24:06] for him but God destroyed Solomon
[24:09] start in verse 20.
[24:13] 18 20 and the Lord said because the
[24:15] Christ Sodom and Gomorrah is great and
[24:17] become because their sin is very
[24:19] Grievous
[24:20] we'll go down now and see whether they
[24:22] have done altogether according to the
[24:24] crime which is coming to me and if not I
[24:27] will know
[24:28] and then turn their faces from thence
[24:30] and went towards Autumn but Abraham
[24:32] stood yet before the Lord and Abraham
[24:34] Drew near
[24:36] and said will thou also destroy the
[24:38] righteous
[24:39] with the wicked pear Adventure there be
[24:42] 50 righteous but then the city let
[24:44] thought destroy and not spare the space
[24:46] for the place for the 50 righteous that
[24:48] are therein
[24:50] that be far from the do after this
[24:52] manner to slay the righteous with the
[24:54] wicked and that the righteous should be
[24:55] as the wicked that be far from thee
[24:59] shall not the judge of all the Earth do
[25:01] right
[25:01] and the Lord said if I find the Sodom 50
[25:04] righteous within the city then I will
[25:05] spare all the police for this for their
[25:07] sakes and Abraham asked and said behold
[25:10] now I have taken upon me to speak unto
[25:12] the Lord which am but dust and Ashes
[25:15] per Adventure there Sherlock
[25:17] five of the 50 righteous will thou
[25:20] destroy all of the city for the lack of
[25:22] five and he said if I find they're 40
[25:24] and 5 I will not destroy it
[25:27] he spoke unto him yet again and said
[25:28] prayer Venture there Jean be 40 found
[25:31] there and he said I will not do it for
[25:33] the 40s sake and he said unto him oh let
[25:36] not the Lord be angry and I will speak
[25:37] Fair eventually there shall Thirty be
[25:39] found and he said I will not do it if I
[25:42] find Thirty there
[25:43] he said behold I know I've taken upon me
[25:45] to speak unto the Lord Prayer Adventure
[25:47] there shall be 20 found
[25:49] he said I will not destroy for 20's sake
[25:51] and he said oh let not the Lord be angry
[25:55] and they'll speak but this once
[25:58] prayer Venture 10 shall be found there
[26:00] and he said I will not destroy it for
[26:01] the Ten's sake and the Lord went his way
[26:04] as soon as he had left communing with
[26:06] Abraham and Abraham returned unto his
[26:08] place
[26:09] and what happened to the city
[26:12] it was destroyed
[26:15] and so
[26:16] the conclusion I guess would be that
[26:18] there wasn't 10 righteous found in the
[26:20] city
[26:21] so that goes back to kind of where we
[26:24] are standing today
[26:27] um
[26:29] the sad place out there in the world
[26:31] it was a sad place in Noah's day it was
[26:34] a sad place in the day of Sodom and
[26:36] Gomorrah and it's a sad place getting
[26:38] ready making itself ready for
[26:40] Destruction today as well
[26:43] we'll just continue here let's see
[26:49] see your Matthew 13 if you want to go
[26:51] with me you can and if you don't we'll
[26:53] just read it and yeah let's see
[27:07] I don't think we
[27:11] Matthew 13.
[27:15] 9
[27:16] we'll start in nine
[27:20] he who had ears to hear Let Him hear and
[27:22] the disciples came and said unto him why
[27:24] speak is done to thou unto them in
[27:26] Parables and he answered and said unto
[27:28] them because it is given unto you to
[27:29] know the mysteries of time of the
[27:31] kingdom of heaven but to them it is not
[27:33] given for whosoever hath to him shall be
[27:36] given and he shall have more abundance
[27:38] but whosoever have not from him shall be
[27:40] taken away from that he hath therefore
[27:43] be guide to them in Parables because
[27:45] they're seeing see not and hearing they
[27:48] hear not neither do they understand
[27:50] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[27:53] isaiahs which saith by hearing ye shall
[27:55] hear and shall not understand and seeing
[27:57] ye shall see and shall not perceive
[27:59] for this people's heart is racks gross
[28:01] and their ears are dull a hearing in
[28:02] their eyes they have closed lest any
[28:04] time they should see with their eyes
[28:06] hear with their ears and should
[28:08] understand with their heart and should
[28:10] be converted and I should heal them but
[28:13] blessed are your eyes for they see in
[28:15] your ears for they hear
[28:17] primarily I say unto you that many
[28:20] prophets and righteous men have desired
[28:21] to see those things which you see and
[28:23] have not seen them and to hear those
[28:25] things which you hear and have not heard
[28:27] them
[28:29] you know if we'll go
[28:31] to Revelations 4
[28:36] no actually Revelations 3.
[28:46] Revelations 3 starting in verse 14.
[28:50] and unto the angel of the Church of the
[28:52] lady was the ends write these things
[28:53] saith amen the faithful and the true
[28:55] witness the beginning of the creation of
[28:58] God and I Know Thy works that thou art
[29:00] neither cold nor hot a word that thou
[29:02] work cold or hot so then because Thou
[29:04] Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I
[29:06] was Beauty out of my mouth
[29:08] because thou sayest I'm rich and
[29:10] increase with goods and have need of
[29:12] nothing know it's not that thou art
[29:13] wretched and miserable and poor and
[29:15] blind and naked
[29:18] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[29:21] mayest be rich in white raiment and thou
[29:24] mayest be clothed and at the shame of
[29:26] thy nakedness do not appear
[29:28] and I know it dies with isaf that thou
[29:31] mayest see as many as I love are broken
[29:34] Jason bezel their form repent
[29:36] if you hold I stand at the door and
[29:38] knock and if any man hear my voice and
[29:39] open the door the door I will come into
[29:41] him and will sup with him and he with me
[29:44] to him that overcometh will I grant sit
[29:46] with me in my throne even as I also
[29:49] overcame and I'm sat down with the
[29:51] father my father in his throne
[29:54] he to have an ear let him hear what the
[29:57] spirit saith unto the churches
[29:59] and we want our ears to be open and our
[30:01] eyes to be open in this day
[30:04] we've we never got all the way through
[30:06] Matthew 24 last time but well
[30:09] it seemed very hard in time here but
[30:13] I got a couple quotes here
[30:21] basically again just looking at where we
[30:23] are in the transition of time we're
[30:26] we're in a late hour
[30:30] um
[30:31] as Jesus said in in 24 there he said he
[30:35] said as it was in the days of Sodom as
[30:37] it was in the days of Noah so shall be
[30:39] in the days of this coming of the son of
[30:41] man so we want our ears to be alert and
[30:43] our eyes to be open
[30:45] to be ready to leave this world because
[30:48] one thing for sure we don't want to stay
[30:50] in this world
[30:52] um it's obviously getting worse and
[30:56] well it's it's bad but
[30:58] um we don't want to be here when when
[31:00] God takes to come to take his bride home
[31:02] we don't want to be left behind
[31:05] uh brother Brandon says here
[31:07] and the other thing is just
[31:10] we have something special uh to just be
[31:12] able to see that God did send a prophet
[31:15] in this day for many people can't see it
[31:17] talking about eyes to hear and ears are
[31:20] here's to hear and eyes to see most
[31:22] people can't see it you can you can wave
[31:25] it to it in front of their face they
[31:27] won't see it they most people chop the
[31:30] scriptures up to what make it say
[31:32] whatever they want it to say
[31:34] and uh goes back to where Jesus told uh
[31:38] or Abraham when talking about the rich
[31:40] man in Abraham he said let me go back
[31:43] let me go back and raise from the dead
[31:45] and go tell my brothers he said not to
[31:48] come to this place and Abraham said they
[31:51] have uh they have the prophets they said
[31:53] he said if one rose from the dead and
[31:55] went and told him they still wouldn't
[31:57] believe
[31:58] and that's kind of where we are brother
[32:00] I'm speaking here
[32:02] he said but I believe that the great
[32:03] calling on the Rival in America has been
[32:05] turned down by the American people in
[32:06] whole they just can't they just simply
[32:09] can't conceive perceive rather the word
[32:12] There's Been Enough gospel preached in
[32:14] the form of the word Across America to
[32:16] have this country a second guard I mean
[32:17] Garden of Eden Eden but they turn it
[32:20] down the great evangelist he's talking
[32:22] about Billy Graham Jack Schuler and many
[32:24] of the other great men Oral Roberts
[32:26] across the country preaching the gospel
[32:27] God working Holy Spirit moving upon the
[32:31] people and them accepting they say
[32:33] accepting Christ is the as their
[32:35] personal Savior and they go Savior and
[32:37] they go right back into the wallow of
[32:39] the world just like they was in the
[32:41] first place and now times that times so
[32:44] many more we have 50 years on this side
[32:46] when brother Branham left preaching the
[32:48] word the the pure unadulterated word and
[32:51] they still go back to the wallow of the
[32:53] world
[32:53] and he goes on to see what the church
[32:56] needs tonight is not new members why the
[32:59] United States is combed over and over by
[33:01] so many evangelists until it's just a
[33:03] burnt territory that's the truth America
[33:05] is absolutely sin to wait it's day of
[33:07] Grace you mark it down on a book
[33:10] he'll never have a universal Revival in
[33:12] America it passed that about three years
[33:15] ago it'll never be a Revival some of you
[33:18] people Mark uh the word down for that
[33:20] there'll never be a nationwide Revival
[33:22] no more like like in the days of old he
[33:24] said and so forth you'll have a little
[33:26] spurt UPS like that until Jesus comes
[33:29] but it will never be Nationwide one God
[33:32] has turned from it he's gone to the
[33:34] foreign Nations that's where the uh
[33:36] that's where the people come one sign
[33:37] from the Lord done thousands and run to
[33:40] the altar of the thousands of heathens
[33:42] will run to alter and it can be done
[33:44] over and over to this bunch of Americans
[33:46] that's been taught this way that way and
[33:49] they're all confused up and they never
[33:51] stop to look in their Bible
[33:53] that's the thing they they always push
[33:55] that we're looking to a man or following
[33:57] a man
[33:58] but there are a lot of times following
[34:01] more of a man's ideas because if they
[34:03] just take what what's heard and take it
[34:06] back to the scriptures and search it out
[34:08] they'd see for themselves but they don't
[34:09] even do the due diligence to do that
[34:13] uh he said the Bible is the word of God
[34:15] it's given to the people to feed on
[34:18] why you got so many ways drawn up it's
[34:20] got to be this way it's got to be the
[34:22] way my church says it's got to be the
[34:24] way my church says and when Jesus come
[34:27] the first time it was all together all
[34:30] together different from what their
[34:31] churches was saying and it'll be all
[34:33] together different from what they're
[34:34] saying today when he comes again because
[34:37] he said he said I've hid it from the
[34:39] eyes of the wise and prudent and will
[34:41] reveal it in the babes such as we'll
[34:42] learn if you're willing to learn take
[34:45] the Bible and search the scriptures for
[34:46] they are they that testify of me said
[34:49] Jesus and them you think you have
[34:51] eternal life and they testify of me
[34:53] and now and know when he come the
[34:57] ministry was so Supernatural to a blind
[34:58] in the eyes of the preachers of that day
[35:00] they couldn't see it they said I'm
[35:03] telling them people what's wrong with
[35:04] them and telling them their names and
[35:06] things that's a devil's Spirit on them
[35:08] it's Beelzebub Jesus said I'll forgive
[35:10] you for that but someday when the Holy
[35:13] Spirit comes he said doing the same
[35:15] thing the one one word against it will
[35:17] never be forgiven in this world or the
[35:19] world to come
[35:20] and brother Brandon says watch Sodom
[35:22] he said now he said as it was in the
[35:25] days of Noah blasphemers and so forth
[35:28] and as it was in the days of Sodom is
[35:30] when the fire fell fire is going to fall
[35:32] this time not water fire the fire will
[35:35] fall from Heavens the Bible says so
[35:37] those volcanic gases that's up there
[35:39] some of these days they're going to push
[35:41] up one of them missiles through there
[35:43] it's going to set a chain around like
[35:45] that perhaps and that's the way it'll
[35:47] come
[35:48] it's at hand we know it can't be much
[35:51] longer science says three minutes well
[35:53] that was then now they say 90 seconds so
[35:56] one minute and a half so it's cut and a
[35:58] half
[35:59] science says longer before midnight the
[36:02] clock will strike one of these hours and
[36:03] it'll be gone within just a few minutes
[36:05] the world will be on fire but before
[36:07] that happens he said the church is going
[36:10] to glory and then at the end of that if
[36:13] then if the end time is that close the
[36:16] coming of the Lord is closer
[36:18] so he says so what are we doing we're
[36:21] sitting watching these things we go home
[36:23] wasn't that amazing and that's not the
[36:25] way to do it he said grab scriptures
[36:27] start through it with prayer in Your
[36:29] Heart Lord God is it that close help me
[36:32] oh Lord hope to Know Thy word and search
[36:35] it and lean up over it and stay with it
[36:38] and miss a few meals and pray to God and
[36:40] you'll come back to the church so
[36:42] charged with the power of God things
[36:43] will will be going to take place around
[36:46] here we got to have it we see the
[36:48] marking Abraham see how it was given to
[36:51] Abraham Abrams Abraham seen that sign
[36:53] before the fire fell and Sodom and
[36:55] Abraham said a seed will see the same
[36:58] sign but for the flowers
[36:59] fall in the modern Sodom of today
[37:02] and we've done seen the sign signed the
[37:04] Abraham scene was
[37:06] the one brother Brown said where Sarah
[37:08] was in the tent he said why did Sarah
[37:10] laugh
[37:11] and we've seen that sign many times so
[37:13] it's getting ready to be going home time
[37:17] so by God's grace we all want to be
[37:19] ready don't want to be left here I know
[37:21] that brother Josh God bless you
[37:26] thank you
[37:35] man let's stay on this morning
[37:40] I've been can we sing that song ready to
[37:41] leave from the twinkling of an eye
[37:52] some folks are building hopes down here
[37:56] my bad
[37:58] sorry let's start with the chorus
[38:03] ready to leave in the twinkling of an

[1:10:02] just take this and talk about Victory
[1:10:03] amen and how that we can have Victory
[1:10:06] amen in Christ Jesus and that's why I
[1:10:09] want brother Josh to Joshua to sing that

[1:10:54] this corruption shall have
[1:10:55] put on incorruption and this Mortal
[1:10:58] shall have put on immortality
[1:11:01] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:11:03] that is written death is swallowed up

[1:11:10] Victory associated with the resurrection
[1:11:13] amen amen at last how many know The Last
[1:11:18] Enemy that is to be defeated is death
[1:11:21] itself right and natural death

[1:11:30] thy sting o grave where is thy victory
[1:11:37] this thing of death is sin and the
[1:11:39] strength of sin is the law but thanks be
[1:11:42] to God which giveth us to Victory
[1:11:44] through our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:11:48] therefore my brethren my beloved
[1:11:51] Brethren be ye steadfast
[1:11:53] unmovable amen how you like that how
[1:11:57] many beliefs that's how we ought to be
[1:11:58] willing to be steadfast
[1:12:00] unmovable always abounding in the work
[1:12:03] of the Lord for as much as you know that
[1:12:05] your labor is not in vain in the Lord
[1:12:07] may God add His blessings to the reading
[1:12:09] of the word you can be uh see that yes
[1:12:12] you know what's coming right so praise
[1:12:15] the Lord
[1:12:17] you know I was just thinking about this
[1:12:19] and of course I was thinking of how much
[1:12:22] this here scripture actually parallels
[1:12:25] another Resurrection amen another
[1:12:28] resurrection and I didn't even think
[1:12:29] about it till I uh
[1:12:34] uh began to read in verse 51 there how
[1:12:38] about how did he says you know
[1:12:41] um behold I show you a mystery we shall
[1:12:43] not all sleep
[1:12:45] amen
[1:12:46] and so I got to thinking of how that
[1:12:50] Paul's
[1:12:53] the day that sleep sleep in the night
[1:12:55] amen and they that are in darkness and
[1:12:58] so forth you know that they're sleeping
[1:13:02] we know that the whole world is space
[1:13:04] particularly asleep amen
[1:13:06] and then uh then it also talks about of
[1:13:10] course how did this corruption must put
[1:13:12] on incorruption and so forth this Mortal
[1:13:16] must put on immortality death must be
[1:13:19] swallowed up in Victory amen
[1:13:22] and so I thought you know actually you
[1:13:25] and I I believe uh Jesus said one place
[1:13:27] he said you know that he that liveth and
[1:13:30] believeth in me shall never die
[1:13:34] amen amen so how many believed
[1:13:38] spiritually you and I have already
[1:13:41] experienced a resurrection
[1:13:45] spiritually speaking amen spiritually
[1:13:47] speaking you and I have already put on
[1:13:50] incorruption
[1:13:53] amen because it talks about being born
[1:13:55] again I've got that seat
[1:13:57] that's quickened on the inside amen and
[1:14:01] guess what we already have triumphant
[1:14:04] and come up in Victory
[1:14:07] you and I already have Victory in Jesus
[1:14:11] praise God Amen I'm gonna go over here
[1:14:15] now I this is I won't say off the
[1:14:17] subject because it's not really but uh I
[1:14:20] just thought of this whenever I was
[1:14:22] studying and I thought I want to bring
[1:14:23] this out amen because it just certainly
[1:14:26] has to do with being Victorious amen now
[1:14:29] notice how it talks about you know
[1:14:31] corruption put on incorruption you know
[1:14:33] and we must be raised from the dead and
[1:14:35] so forth but you know in Ephesians the
[1:14:37] second chapter he says and you hath he
[1:14:40] quickened who were dead
[1:14:42] amen I believe
[1:14:45] Once Upon a Time spiritually you and I
[1:14:47] were dead the whole world is dead I man
[1:14:51] we're born in sin shaped and liquidity
[1:14:53] basically born dead amen but he has
[1:14:56] quickened us or made us alive where in
[1:14:59] times past you will walk according to
[1:15:02] the course of this world according to
[1:15:04] the prince of the power of the air that
[1:15:06] worketh now and the children of
[1:15:07] Disobedience among whom also you had
[1:15:10] your conversation in times past in the
[1:15:13] lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires
[1:15:16] of the Flesh and of the Mind
[1:15:19] amen and War by Nature the children of
[1:15:23] Wrath even as others
[1:15:27] amen so how many knows that one time
[1:15:30] maybe we were living by the desires of
[1:15:32] the flesh
[1:15:34] we did whatever the flesh desired amen
[1:15:37] and and so forth and of the mind and
[1:15:40] we're by Nature notice the word Nature
[1:15:43] by nature in other words we had the
[1:15:45] nature of the children of Wrath
[1:15:50] even as others but God who is rich in
[1:15:54] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:15:56] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[1:16:00] hath quickened us together in Christ
[1:16:03] amen and has raised us up together and
[1:16:08] has made us to sit together in Heavenly
[1:16:10] places in Christ Jesus
[1:16:14] amen he's taking you from the Lolly
[1:16:17] Wally Woos or the the the the the Wally
[1:16:20] grubs I think some of us say and
[1:16:22] everything else amen and all the blues
[1:16:25] and he has given you and set you in
[1:16:27] Heavenly places
[1:16:28] amen you know just before I got that
[1:16:30] come out I had this thought you know and
[1:16:32] I thought about how that we really and I
[1:16:35] I feel like that if you're born again
[1:16:38] and you have the Holy Spirit
[1:16:43] a lot of time we don't even realize what
[1:16:45] we have
[1:16:48] you don't even realize what you got
[1:16:52] amen
[1:16:53] and the only way to really get all of
[1:16:57] all of that you can out from the holy
[1:16:59] spirit is to cultivate the spirit isn't
[1:17:02] that right
[1:17:03] we're going to talk with a little bit
[1:17:04] this morning with the help of the Lord
[1:17:06] about the black dog and the white dog
[1:17:08] also you know because when we're talking
[1:17:10] about Victory we're talking about
[1:17:12] overcoming something right
[1:17:14] talking about overcoming and we know
[1:17:17] that already Jesus said in every Church
[1:17:19] age at the end of whatever he said to
[1:17:21] him he always said to him that
[1:17:24] overcometh will I get out to sit with me
[1:17:27] in my throne
[1:17:29] amen
[1:17:30] and I wrote down here and I'm just going
[1:17:32] to get started here I wrote down here
[1:17:33] once upon a time long long ago
[1:17:38] amen many ages ago there lived the
[1:17:40] people amen and they lived not in
[1:17:44] Victory but they lived in defeat
[1:17:49] and also I'll throw this in here as I
[1:17:52] wrote this down 98 percent
[1:17:55] it's not an accurate estimation
[1:17:59] because it's probably a a higher number
[1:18:02] than 98.
[1:18:04] but
[1:18:05] I just put about 98 that that would be
[1:18:07] my guesstimation of people and all of
[1:18:10] Christendom
[1:18:11] all that claims to be Christian amen
[1:18:15] that claims to be Christian live in
[1:18:17] defeat
[1:18:21] they live in defeat
[1:18:23] amen
[1:18:25] because even Jesus said if I don't
[1:18:27] shorten the days no flesh shall be saved
[1:18:31] amen these few there be that find it by
[1:18:35] the band the way he talked about it he
[1:18:37] says man there's just going to be a few
[1:18:38] that are going to make that rapture wow
[1:18:40] it's scary almost is how he makes it
[1:18:43] sound but you know into such because you
[1:18:45] claim Christianity doesn't mean that
[1:18:47] you're living in Victory
[1:18:50] and that's what we want I don't know
[1:18:51] about you but that's what I want I want
[1:18:53] to live in Victory don't we all want to
[1:18:56] live a Victorious Christian Life
[1:19:00] long long ago in the land Far Far Away
[1:19:03] many ages ago as a matter of fact it's
[1:19:05] been around 2 000 years ago amen for 4
[1:19:09] 000 years people had to live in defeat
[1:19:14] now they had many victories
[1:19:18] isn't that right
[1:19:19] amen we talk about David think about
[1:19:22] David and how did he had a great victory
[1:19:24] over Goliath and all the victories that
[1:19:27] he had but with all the victories that
[1:19:30] he had he still had to live and defeat
[1:19:32] you have to live in defeat you couldn't
[1:19:34] live any other way but in defeat
[1:19:41] why because if they had been living in
[1:19:44] Victory why would we have needed Christ
[1:19:48] huh
[1:19:49] you know no matter how many great
[1:19:51] victories he had he still failed the
[1:19:53] Bathsheba
[1:19:55] is that right
[1:19:57] he was still defeated and even if he
[1:19:59] perhaps wouldn't have fell in that way
[1:20:01] it doesn't matter
[1:20:04] they still had
[1:20:06] that sin on the inside
[1:20:09] that carnal nature was still in there
[1:20:13] amen
[1:20:16] we want to deal with that with the help
[1:20:18] of the Lord
[1:20:20] now how many knows that uh
[1:20:22] you think about that I think about him I
[1:20:25] think about David
[1:20:27] I think about shamgar I mean those they
[1:20:30] had many deliverers in the Book of
[1:20:32] Judges you can go through the Book of
[1:20:34] Judges and there's uh you know uh what
[1:20:38] was it Gideon and Samson and all these
[1:20:40] different people that God raised up to
[1:20:42] be there to deliver and they would
[1:20:44] deliver them they would get delivered
[1:20:47] huh
[1:20:49] they would have Victory but they would
[1:20:51] always fall back in defeat
[1:20:55] Joshua think about Joshua the Great
[1:20:58] Mighty Warrior he was a mighty warrior
[1:21:00] but he took him over across the promised
[1:21:02] land and how many knows that they ended
[1:21:04] up completely sinning
[1:21:06] and completely being done away with by
[1:21:09] God and going to all the nations of the
[1:21:11] world
[1:21:14] it was terrible
[1:21:17] and I think about a lot of times
[1:21:18] Christians that claim to be Christians
[1:21:20] is that right we can claim to be
[1:21:23] Christians
[1:21:25] and we might have a victory or two but
[1:21:27] why would we always fall back into
[1:21:29] defeat
[1:21:32] huh
[1:21:37] I don't believe we have to do you I
[1:21:40] believe Christ came to change that in
[1:21:42] our life
[1:21:43] he wants you to live in Victory and
[1:21:45] notice how Paul said you know oh death
[1:21:48] he talked about even death where's your
[1:21:50] sting I'm not afraid of you anymore and
[1:21:53] you don't scare me anymore you don't
[1:21:54] have a sting anymore but I thank God who
[1:21:58] Christ do God who gives us the victory
[1:22:03] how many believe that's what Christ come
[1:22:05] for is to give us victory
[1:22:11] oh Hallelujah we know that when Christ
[1:22:13] came what did you he defeated every
[1:22:15] devil there ever was Amen in the third
[1:22:18] or fourth chapter of Matthew when he was
[1:22:20] tempted with the lust of the Flesh and
[1:22:22] lust of the eye and the kind of life and
[1:22:23] all these temptations that the devil
[1:22:25] come out of me and overcome every one of
[1:22:27] them he come over come epilepsy he
[1:22:29] overcome blindness he overcome the every
[1:22:33] Temptation everything that everyone
[1:22:35] wants he overcome he was Victorious he
[1:22:37] was triumphant over all of them amen he
[1:22:40] all and all the way to the Grave
[1:22:43] even Jesus oh my talking about prayer
[1:22:46] being a real powerful uh tool in the
[1:22:48] hands of a real Warrior if you really
[1:22:50] want to see a warrior overcoming you'll
[1:22:52] find him on their knees
[1:22:55] is that right I mean those Jesus in the
[1:22:57] garden amen he overcame and that brother
[1:23:00] bam said he was his greatest test amen
[1:23:02] whether he would overcome himself
[1:23:05] in other words not my will he says well
[1:23:08] if it'd be possible let this type
[1:23:10] it was so hard on this place she wanted
[1:23:13] to have to do this and it was a real
[1:23:15] battle
[1:23:17] but he overcoming The Garden of
[1:23:19] Gethsemane and remember even Jesus said
[1:23:21] to disciples he said pray with me that
[1:23:23] you fall not in Temptation amen how many
[1:23:26] believe you you're not going to fall in
[1:23:28] Temptation it takes prayer
[1:23:33] it takes like I said King staying in
[1:23:36] tune with almighty God if you're gonna
[1:23:38] be a mighty Victorious Warrior amen
[1:23:40] you're going to have to absolutely stay
[1:23:42] in tune
[1:23:45] because if you don't
[1:23:47] the white dog will get weaker the black
[1:23:50] dog gets stronger
[1:23:52] amen
[1:23:54] now we know that their nature in the Old
[1:23:56] Testament wasn't changed that was their
[1:23:59] that was their problem
[1:24:02] every no matter how many times it would
[1:24:04] come in awe for their sacrifices and so
[1:24:06] forth their nature would still be the
[1:24:08] same
[1:24:09] how many beliefs you and I have to have
[1:24:11] a nature before you can actually be
[1:24:13] victorious you have to have a nature
[1:24:15] change
[1:24:17] now I know brother Phil's been here and
[1:24:19] he's ministered Brother Brad said at
[1:24:21] different places and we talk about the
[1:24:22] flesh isn't that right we talk about the
[1:24:24] flesh we talk about this
[1:24:26] spirit and and uh
[1:24:30] you know how that how that even though
[1:24:32] your nature even even though you're born
[1:24:34] again
[1:24:36] isn't that right even though you're born
[1:24:38] again now that Spirit on the inside has
[1:24:41] changed
[1:24:42] the desires has changed but this flesh
[1:24:45] it still has the same desires it always
[1:24:47] has on it
[1:24:49] it doesn't change the desires of your
[1:24:52] flesh but it does to change the desires
[1:24:54] of your spirit and your soul
[1:24:58] amen
[1:25:01] so let's look at that with just the help
[1:25:03] of the Lord for a minute now let's look
[1:25:04] at that I've got about four or five
[1:25:07] different places I'd like to go amen and
[1:25:09] look at things this morning but
[1:25:12] amen
[1:25:15] remember they had the law in the Old
[1:25:18] Testament didn't they they had the law
[1:25:21] okay
[1:25:25] and that law Paul said was holy
[1:25:29] is that right
[1:25:31] sure he said that law was holy
[1:25:34] their enrollments we're going to go to
[1:25:36] Romans 8 here real quick
[1:25:39] we're going to look at this let's take
[1:25:40] our time going too fast already
[1:25:51] and Paul talked about this
[1:25:53] in chapter 7 just before he talked about
[1:25:56] the flesh because first of all let me
[1:26:00] just say this as we talked about Victory
[1:26:02] how many knows that
[1:26:04] uh
[1:26:06] you could uh you could move mountains
[1:26:09] with faith Paul said in First
[1:26:10] Corinthians and so forth but if you
[1:26:12] haven't got the love of God in your
[1:26:13] heart all of that doesn't do any good
[1:26:16] amen
[1:26:18] in Israel if you think about it Israel
[1:26:21] amen no matter how much law the law was
[1:26:24] holy but they they weren't holy amen so
[1:26:27] let's just read it chapter 7 and we'll
[1:26:30] begin with
[1:26:31] uh
[1:26:33] let me see what I've got marked down
[1:26:34] here
[1:26:36] 7 and 12.
[1:26:38] wherefore notice the law is Holy
[1:26:43] is Holy and just and good
[1:26:46] Thou shalt not steal that's good Thou
[1:26:49] shalt not commit adultery that's good
[1:26:51] Thou shalt not covet the neighbor's
[1:26:53] things amen all this is all good is that
[1:26:57] right
[1:26:59] was then that which is good made death
[1:27:02] unto me God forbid but sin that it might
[1:27:04] appear sin working death in Me by that
[1:27:07] which is good that sin by commandment
[1:27:10] might become exceedingly sinful now
[1:27:12] here's the point I want to get to for we
[1:27:14] know that the law is spiritual but I am
[1:27:17] carnal Soul under sin
[1:27:21] so now we see why that Israel always Was
[1:27:25] Defeated isn't that right
[1:27:28] okay could never keep the Commandments
[1:27:30] because their nature was completely
[1:27:33] contrary to it
[1:27:35] amen
[1:27:37] praise be to God
[1:27:39] now I didn't finish my thought here a
[1:27:42] minute ago when I was beginning to talk
[1:27:43] about Israel my point that I want to get
[1:27:45] to First is first of all the greatest
[1:27:49] enemy we have we know is ourself is that
[1:27:52] right
[1:27:52] so that's what we have to be victorious
[1:27:55] over thirst
[1:27:57] everything else is insignificant you
[1:28:00] have to conquer yourself
[1:28:03] amen that's what we want victory over
[1:28:05] and I I was back there thinking you know
[1:28:07] uh of what we really have if what we
[1:28:10] really what we're what we're capable of
[1:28:14] what the possibilities of us uh as as
[1:28:17] Christians are but there's a lot of
[1:28:19] times things that hold us back isn't
[1:28:21] that right
[1:28:22] and that is of course our flesh
[1:28:25] it's like that sound barrier the prophet
[1:28:27] of God talked about if you could ever
[1:28:28] break that sound barrier if you ever can
[1:28:30] get past your flesh amen then all things
[1:28:34] are possible to them that believe
[1:28:36] if you say to this mountain move it'll
[1:28:39] be moved how many believe that if you
[1:28:41] could just actually him completely
[1:28:43] conquer ourselves because I'll tell you
[1:28:44] this right now I believe we're coming
[1:28:46] close to the coming of the Lord and I
[1:28:48] believe the pride is to be a Victorious
[1:28:51] bride
[1:28:53] an invincible Army something that the
[1:28:56] devil doesn't know what to do with
[1:28:58] that's why I tying it in with Lindsay
[1:29:00] talking about all these different
[1:29:01] channels avenues that the Devil comes at
[1:29:04] you she takes your ears smell
[1:29:05] concentration memory and all of those
[1:29:08] things but you got to have the soldier
[1:29:11] the Holy Ghost on the Forefront guarding
[1:29:14] the devil that's a roaring lion to keep
[1:29:16] him from coming in any of those channels
[1:29:19] that's why you don't stand a chance
[1:29:21] without the Holy Ghost
[1:29:22] because Christ is our Victory how many
[1:29:26] believe he is our Victory but I want to
[1:29:29] look at with the help of the Lord this
[1:29:31] morning is what is in Christ that gives
[1:29:34] you the power to overcome and listen to
[1:29:36] this even though you have the Holy Ghost
[1:29:38] you don't overcome everything right then
[1:29:41] and there
[1:29:43] no no you don't always you know because
[1:29:45] you don't how many knows we've had the
[1:29:48] Holy Ghost but many times we have failed
[1:29:51] to overcome things
[1:29:52] but if you'll surrender yourself and I
[1:29:55] thought I thought this was so awesome
[1:29:57] because amen I believe it says uh our
[1:29:59] general was coming to Richmond and they
[1:30:01] were saying well how are we going to
[1:30:02] take a Richmond how are we going to take
[1:30:04] Richmond he says we're going to take
[1:30:05] Richmond just as we come to it amen they
[1:30:08] had not lead to such a flow of victory
[1:30:10] that hey when we get there we'll take
[1:30:12] care of it the Americans and the and the
[1:30:15] allies when World War II we had gotten
[1:30:17] into such a group that when we come into
[1:30:18] Germany we come into one city to another
[1:30:21] and we come to another and we was coming
[1:30:23] to get you we was coming through and
[1:30:25] nobody could stop us they were in the
[1:30:28] groove of Victory and I believe that's
[1:30:30] what you and I want this morning let's
[1:30:32] get in the groove of Victory amen and
[1:30:34] get the devil anything that comes your
[1:30:36] way and then overcome it as it comes
[1:30:41] just as it comes as your Bibles comes as
[1:30:44] God allows things to come to your way
[1:30:46] amen overcoming because if you don't
[1:30:48] overcome it you're gonna suffer the
[1:30:50] agony of the feet and there's a whole
[1:30:52] lot of Christians that are suffering

[1:30:55] and the miserableness of defeat

[1:31:24] books you know or what you do he just
[1:31:26] wants you to live and defeat
[1:31:30] and you do one or the other how many
[1:31:32] beliefs we live in either we're living
[1:31:34] in the thrill of victory or we're living
[1:31:36] in the agony of defeat
[1:31:39] and Israel could never overcome it they
[1:31:41] always had that emptiness just like you
[1:31:42] and I did when we were out in the world
[1:31:44] we always had that emptiness
[1:31:46] that horrible feeling but you ain't
[1:31:48] gotta have that horrible feeling anymore

[1:32:45] and she just rebuked it amen I'll tell
[1:32:48] you what I believe Wednesday there's
[1:32:50] some Devil's cast out amen whenever you

[1:33:25] spirit which we want to get into it but
[1:33:27] you have it all the armor of God that we
[1:33:29] want to get into and then the last is
[1:33:30] and have the sword of the spirit which
[1:33:32] is the word of God
[1:33:34] folks how many has ever watched an old
[1:33:36] movie of where they used to have swords
[1:33:38] and decided in the other and they'd be
[1:33:39] sitting around the campfire amen sitting
[1:33:41] around the campfires I'm wearing they
[1:33:43] had their big sword and for you
[1:33:45] what you doing I'm sharpening my sword

[1:33:53] hit that hand in me I want you I want
[1:33:54] his head to come from off
[1:33:56] I want a sharp sword how many believes
[1:33:58] that you and I are here this morning to
[1:33:59] sharpen our swords amen so that when you
[1:34:02] meet him tomorrow wherever you meet him
[1:34:03] I mean you can say get that behind me

[1:34:21] Victory from you you take it back
[1:34:24] amen praise be to God I like that
[1:34:28] oh my
[1:34:31] all right now notice and then of course
[1:34:34] Paul goes down there and he says oh
[1:34:36] Wretched Man now that I'm a man every
[1:34:37] time I want to do good I don't do it in
[1:34:39] this out of the other isn't that right
[1:34:41] but in chapter 8 he says this no ma he
[1:34:43] said but there is now enough for no
[1:34:45] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:34:47] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:34:49] after the spirit for the law of the
[1:34:51] spirit of Christ has made me free from
[1:34:53] the law of sin and death for what the
[1:34:55] law could not do in that it was weak to
[1:34:57] the Flesh in other words the law wanted
[1:34:58] to make them holy the law wanted to make
[1:35:01] them right
[1:35:03] isn't that right
[1:35:04] sure it did
[1:35:06] but he could not do it because it was
[1:35:08] weak through the flesh God sending his
[1:35:10] own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:35:12] and forcing condemn sin in the flesh
[1:35:14] that the righteousness of the law might
[1:35:16] be fulfilled in us who walked not after
[1:35:19] the flesh but after the spirit
[1:35:22] for that or after the flesh do mind the
[1:35:24] things of the flesh isn't that the truth
[1:35:27] give me a big old amen then I walk after
[1:35:30] the flesh your mind to sing to the Flesh
[1:35:32] and that's why we ain't got Victory

[1:35:35] flesh do my
[1:35:38] laughs
[1:35:40] folk I'm telling you what if you kept
[1:35:43] your mind more on Christ and you prayed
[1:35:44] more all week long our service would be
[1:35:46] different than what they are you coming

[1:35:50] have a little fire you'd have a pillar
[1:35:52] of Fire

[1:35:56] fire I'm telling you the spirit of God

[1:39:07] what right now the Holy Spirit and those
[1:39:09] who are might be in triumphant they

[1:39:21] even if Jesus even even said Jesus he
[1:39:23] was calmly amen there was no Beauty in
[1:39:25] him that we would desire him naturally
[1:39:27] speaking there was he was nothing to
[1:39:29] look at
[1:39:29] but he had power to walk on water he had
[1:39:32] power to raise hazardous from the dead
[1:39:33] and I'm telling you right now it might
[1:39:35] not look like my dumbbell Was Defeated
[1:39:37] amen Saints of all the ages down through

[1:40:47] Israel couldn't have it
[1:40:50] they couldn't have it if they tried
[1:40:52] sure they had victories they had Goliath
[1:40:54] this fall dad Jack always fall
[1:40:57] balls fall but still that same sorrow in
[1:41:00] their heart
[1:41:02] still defeated in their heart
[1:41:04] no wonder they went back no wonder they
[1:41:06] went back and back and back and back
[1:41:08] huh
[1:41:11] good lesson for us isn't it no wonder
[1:41:14] people go back and go back go back

[1:41:39] for to be commonly minded It's death but
[1:41:42] to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:41:45] peace
[1:41:48] amen
[1:41:50] brother as we get older the desire that
[1:41:55] we used to like stuff just isn't there
[1:41:57] anymore is it
[1:41:58] the Bible talks about when your desire
[1:42:01] when you get older your desire fails
[1:42:04] huh
[1:42:06] you know all the things that we thought
[1:42:07] was so awesome and great and this out of
[1:42:09] the other and you know
[1:42:12] folks I'm really backslid I mean I
[1:42:14] didn't even go hunt turkey yet I used to
[1:42:16] be out there the first day I had to be
[1:42:18] out there and I was hunting I was all a
[1:42:19] young robot and I'm like not all so
[1:42:21] don't know about it anymore it's just a
[1:42:24] bird folks
[1:42:25] I'd almost rather be putting the two by
[1:42:27] four together giving me an extra storage
[1:42:28] shed or something you know
[1:42:31] and other things how many desire fails
[1:42:34] the real Zeal of life begins to not be
[1:42:37] there but let me tell you when you get
[1:42:39] spiritually minded and you realize one
[1:42:40] of these days so we're going to a land
[1:42:43] where we're better go out we're going to
[1:42:45] an eternal place
[1:42:47] then life comes back all right like that
[1:42:50] old man up there amen and Preacher Man
[1:42:52] 80 years old I mean he come out there
[1:42:54] they talk about the rainbow just out of
[1:42:56] the other click this truth they got it
[1:42:57] begin they have a little life back I
[1:42:59] mean between you we need to be Lively
[1:43:01] Stones the Bible said We're Not Dead
[1:43:03] songs we're Lively songs
[1:43:06] oh my he's alive
[1:43:09] he's alive he's alive I'm forgiven not
[1:43:12] that just he's alive but I'm alive I'm
[1:43:15] alive I'm alive I'm forgiven how many
[1:43:18] he's alive this morning
[1:43:20] your religion don't have a little
[1:43:21] emotion maybe you ought to go out there
[1:43:23] and have a funeral
[1:43:25] bury it
[1:43:27] how many believe that
[1:43:31] I get enthused just thinking about this
[1:43:33] stuff
[1:43:36] why because it's the right thoughts
[1:43:39] how many at least you need to think the
[1:43:40] right thoughts
[1:43:43] oh my praise be to God
[1:43:47] all right
[1:43:50] why because they had the same
[1:43:52] carnality amen
[1:43:55] you can never be a Christian walking
[1:43:58] after the flesh
[1:44:01] you can never be a Christian have be
[1:44:03] carnally minded
[1:44:06] you have to be spiritually minded
[1:44:10] amen
[1:44:14] because of carnal mind is enmity against
[1:44:17] God
[1:44:18] and it is not subject to God neither the
[1:44:21] law
[1:44:22] indeed can be so that they that are in
[1:44:25] the flesh
[1:44:27] they cannot please God well if you just
[1:44:29] took that the wrong way you think well
[1:44:30] I'm In the Flesh I'll never please God
[1:44:33] what does Paul say the very next verse
[1:44:36] verse 9 but ye are not in the flesh
[1:44:39] how many believe you don't live from
[1:44:41] satisfy the flesh you're there to
[1:44:45] satisfy and live in the spirit
[1:44:49] but because the flashes were the only
[1:44:52] thing that's left
[1:44:53] to be redeemed is his body
[1:45:00] oh my I was thinking and I hope this I
[1:45:03] shouldn't never say this but I guess I
[1:45:06] didn't open the bag already but I was
[1:45:08] thinking
[1:45:09] what's the difference between a
[1:45:11] born-again Christian
[1:45:13] and his accessibility to the powers of
[1:45:15] God what's the difference between you
[1:45:17] and Jesus
[1:45:20] there's only one difference
[1:45:24] there's one difference
[1:45:26] because we know our Soul's been redeemed
[1:45:28] I know that we have every right that
[1:45:30] Adam lost we have every right to speak
[1:45:32] to the trees and everything else
[1:45:34] we have every right to all of the Bibles
[1:45:36] every promise in the book is mine every
[1:45:38] chapter every verse every Lion The Works
[1:45:40] that I do shall you do also but what's
[1:45:43] the difference
[1:45:44] there's only one difference and that is
[1:45:46] his body was perfect he was perfect
[1:45:50] you and I were we not you and I aren't
[1:45:54] we're still subject to failure
[1:45:57] it's the only difference
[1:45:59] it's all right but aren't you glad that
[1:46:02] oh my I'm gonna have failures and I'm
[1:46:04] gonna stumble and then no don't just
[1:46:05] stay down there you get back up again
[1:46:07] cause you've got the same Authority that
[1:46:09] Jesus did how many believe that God gave
[1:46:11] you power he gave you authority over
[1:46:13] every devil and you have every
[1:46:16] right and everything that Christ had you
[1:46:19] have
[1:46:23] makes me want to jump and shout and I
[1:46:25] don't know what all that
[1:46:26] think
[1:46:28] we've been restored to every right
[1:46:34] oh my
[1:46:36] what was it one time a lady asked if you
[1:46:37] don't know what her sickness was but it
[1:46:39] was pretty sincere and after she was
[1:46:40] prayed for she just says Nah you gotta
[1:46:44] go
[1:46:45] huh how many leaves that's the way ought
[1:46:47] to be with us we get sick this Saturday
[1:46:48] I don't know I've prayed and I've asked
[1:46:50] God to heal me and our devil get out out
[1:46:52] of here now
[1:46:54] amen and they go on
[1:46:57] like it's done already I don't care if
[1:46:59] you fall over dead act like it's not
[1:47:01] already
[1:47:05] getting better bam says Scott can never
[1:47:07] do anything for you took a whole sermon
[1:47:09] on one time until you accept for this
[1:47:11] that it's done already
[1:47:13] can't do nothing Gloria said it is
[1:47:15] finished now you have to say it's done
[1:47:18] because he said it's done
[1:47:20] now our contention has to be the
[1:47:22] confession of what he said
[1:47:23] now what your body tells you
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:32] [Applause]
[1:47:35] know it I'm gonna stop and read your
[1:47:37] story
[1:47:38] about 15 years ago the BAM says I was
[1:47:40] standing in this platform here with a
[1:47:42] great big old chart teaching I like that
[1:47:44] and there's a little Pentecostal group
[1:47:46] came from Louisville and I never did
[1:47:47] believe in them people dancing the way
[1:47:49] that they did and there's a little up
[1:47:52] here to play Anna and they was going to
[1:47:54] play a little special and beat on the 10
[1:47:56] symbols on a washboard and some of them
[1:47:59] beat on a tin can and I was very much a
[1:48:02] Critic of it I thought well now what's
[1:48:03] going to happen and the woman came up to
[1:48:05] play the special she got in the play and
[1:48:07] the lady got the beaten on the washboard
[1:48:12] I mean we need a little beat sometimes
[1:48:14] hello oh and the lady got the washboard
[1:48:16] and this little blonde headed girl
[1:48:18] jumped out on the floor began to dance
[1:48:19] in the spirit and me sitting there
[1:48:22] weren't full and I said now I wish I
[1:48:23] could look at that
[1:48:25] I've been telling my church till they
[1:48:26] were wondering what I was going to do
[1:48:27] about it I kept looking at her and I
[1:48:30] thought oh look at that now if that
[1:48:32] isn't something making my my making a
[1:48:34] Tavern out of my church
[1:48:36] now sitting there not knowing any better
[1:48:38] and I wasn't seeing anything but in my
[1:48:40] heart I was thinking that
[1:48:42] so I watched her there while she was
[1:48:44] dancing the first thing you know I said
[1:48:46] now wait a minute I wonder if the ladies
[1:48:49] got any scripture for that and I began
[1:48:50] to think about the scripture I said
[1:48:51] where was dancing never ordained at in
[1:48:54] the first place in the Bible I thought
[1:48:55] well what made them dance and I see that
[1:48:58] the children of Israel when they crossed
[1:49:00] the Red Sea Miriam looked back and seen
[1:49:02] all of those Taskmaster Strouds
[1:49:06] and she picked up a tambourine at the
[1:49:08] beginning of dance let me tell you when
[1:49:10] you see all them Devils that bother you

[1:56:03] I imagine
[1:56:06] congregation thought whoa our pastor has
[1:56:09] done lost it
[1:56:12] I can only imagine what them folks
[1:56:14] thought because you know brother Brandon
[1:56:16] really didn't teach that all that much
[1:56:17] before this he was critical all of a
[1:56:20] sudden he got to realizing
[1:56:23] you know I remember all those things
[1:56:26] that bothered me
[1:56:27] I remember all those Devils that tried
[1:56:29] to keep me down and knowledge of Jesus
[1:56:31] whatever I went to that words and I said
[1:56:34] God if you can help me save my sinner
[1:56:36] save me a sinner and he walked away and
[1:56:38] with all that load lifted he began to
[1:56:41] worship God and I want you to know I
[1:56:42] don't I want you you've got the Amazing
[1:56:45] Grace how sweet the sound that say the
[1:56:47] rats like me that's all I have to have
[1:56:49] to worship God for a trillion years and
[1:56:52] just because he saved a Wretch like
[1:56:54] Thomas
[1:56:56] no count
[1:57:00] and he saved me out of the millions that
[1:57:02] are out there lost his sin and shame and
[1:57:05] that are dying and God's Gonna destroy
[1:57:07] all of mankind
[1:57:11] but he's gonna spare
[1:57:13] those that call upon his name how many
[1:57:15] slapped that he's going to spare some of
[1:57:16] us yes he's gonna spare

[1:57:27] oh my
[1:57:29] God that's right God take me
[1:57:31] then I said God take me out of Deceit it
[1:57:33] is scornful
[1:57:35] let me look at anything sensibly before
[1:57:37] I pass judge me more God does things
[1:57:40] peculiar now I don't believe in a lot of
[1:57:43] nonsense
[1:57:44] I don't believe in a lot of this Tommy
[1:57:46] rot but I believe in the real genuine
[1:57:49] Spirit-filled Holy Ghost word of God
[1:57:51] being preached in the power and
[1:57:53] demonstration amen that's the thing that
[1:57:55] saved me that's the thing that has
[1:57:57] brought me thus this are amen that's the
[1:57:59] thing that has helped me when every
[1:58:01] doctor said that I was dying that's the
[1:58:03] thing that saved me in the hour of my
[1:58:05] death how many he was he was writing to
[1:58:06] death and his heart was beating so slow
[1:58:09] and all of his blood was on the pan
[1:58:10] being so slow and they said he's gonna
[1:58:12] go he's leaving he's leaving he was just
[1:58:14] about gone and God spared him
[1:58:16] hey man he had something to praise God
[1:58:18] about
[1:58:19] that's the thing that'll resurrect me
[1:58:24] that's the thing that I'll go to heaven
[1:58:26] with if I ever get there oh my I'll have
[1:58:29] to go buy it because I don't know
[1:58:31] nothing else but that I don't know
[1:58:33] nothing else but that that's right Jesus
[1:58:35] and him crucified
[1:58:37] glory and I'm dead to all the things of
[1:58:40] the world
[1:58:42] oh some God Marnie
[1:58:46] I'll Fly Away I mean it believes You're
[1:58:49] Gonna Fly Away one of these days
[1:58:51] to a home on God Celestial sword we but
[1:58:54] if Troy I think I think he's feeling it
[1:58:55] too if this world is getting just too
[1:58:58] bad to even living anymore
[1:59:00] amen
[1:59:02] it's time to leave this world I remember
[1:59:05] brother John Steam and brother remember
[1:59:06] they all remember way back
[1:59:09] what was that I was 20 that was 40 years
[1:59:11] ago something 40 years ago brother John
[1:59:14] would always preach boy I'll tell you
[1:59:15] what it can't go much every service he
[1:59:17] preached you can talk about the end of
[1:59:18] time it can't go much longer can't go
[1:59:20] much longer and I thought what would he
[1:59:21] think about all of this now look at
[1:59:23] where we're at how late it really is
[1:59:26] truly it's getting close folks
[1:59:28] truly it's getting close
[1:59:31] and that means
[1:59:33] it's time to do what Jesus said
[1:59:36] be ready
[1:59:38] for you know not the hour nor the day
[1:59:42] how many beliefs we need to be ready
[1:59:44] we need to be victorious we need to live
[1:59:47] Victorious lives every day
[1:59:53] I don't know about you but I want to be
[1:59:55] the kind of Christian that as
[1:59:58] these battles come up hello
[2:00:01] as these battles come up
[2:00:05] by the power of the Holy Ghost to
[2:00:07] overcome them
[2:00:15] preaching Wednesday
[2:00:16] I went home and thought about what I had
[2:00:19] said and so forth and I realized that my
[2:00:21] battle in my thoughts that I had that
[2:00:23] week
[2:00:24] that I actually the actual thing that
[2:00:27] helped me to overcome
[2:00:29] was love
[2:00:32] was love
[2:00:35] how many believe that love is one of the
[2:00:37] greatest weapons there is to overcoming
[2:00:42] foreign
[2:00:45] not going to make a long service because
[2:00:47] I was going to go to Ephesians where's
[2:00:49] the armor you know having done all the
[2:00:51] stands stand therefore having on the
[2:00:53] Blessed paid of righteousness the helmet
[2:00:55] of salvation and all these other things
[2:00:57] praying and always Jesus but I mean Paul
[2:01:00] said always praying in the Holy Ghost I
[2:01:03] believe that's real powerful Christian
[2:01:04] to always be praised
[2:01:07] but you know I thought about faith you
[2:01:09] know how that Faith you know uh will
[2:01:11] quench all the fiery Darks of the week
[2:01:13] There's great things that faith will do
[2:01:15] but Paul said in First Corinthians 13
[2:01:17] though I have faith so that I can move
[2:01:20] mountains
[2:01:21] huh
[2:01:22] because faith I tell you what how many
[2:01:24] knows that David had faith those in the
[2:01:26] Old Testament even though they weren't
[2:01:27] born again they have faith and God
[2:01:30] honored their faith God will honor Faith
[2:01:32] No Matter What
[2:01:33] huh but that doesn't seal you into the
[2:01:36] kingdom Paul says you got to have
[2:01:38] something more than that
[2:01:39] and something what's more powerful than
[2:01:41] faith is love
[2:01:44] amen
[2:01:48] oh man I thought you know there's
[2:01:51] nothing that real genuine love won't
[2:01:54] overcome
[2:02:00] and I mean look the devil will do
[2:02:02] anything to bring hatred
[2:02:04] variance
[2:02:06] strife
[2:02:08] over in Galatians says let nothing be
[2:02:10] done through Strife or vain Glory
[2:02:14] the devil wants to bring Strife he wants
[2:02:16] to bring division he wants to bring
[2:02:18] immune emulation and all these other
[2:02:21] things even variance
[2:02:24] may I don't know for sure what variance
[2:02:26] means but I would think that it would be
[2:02:28] something that would vary something
[2:02:29] would be different maybe I'm wrong but
[2:02:32] we're not supposed to be very we're
[2:02:34] supposed to be one in mind heart and
[2:02:37] soul how many believe that
[2:02:41] amen
[2:02:43] it's one thing that overcomes hate it
[2:02:47] overcomes and it overcomes just about
[2:02:49] anything how many believe that can we
[2:02:51] read that yet maybe I've skipped some of
[2:02:53] the other stuff I want to bring this
[2:02:54] down Paul said though I speak with
[2:02:56] tongues of men and angels and have not
[2:02:58] charity I am become a sounding brass and
[2:03:00] the tinkling symbol and do I have to
[2:03:03] give the prophecy and understand all
[2:03:04] Mysteries hello
[2:03:06] and all knowledge and though I have all
[2:03:09] Faith so that I can remove mountains and
[2:03:11] I have not charity I am nothing
[2:03:17] folks
[2:03:18] wouldn't it be nice if we had
[2:03:21] speaking in tongues and churches
[2:03:26] somebody else over here interpreted
[2:03:29] and say brother now brother Woody don't
[2:03:31] you go under the scaffold tomorrow
[2:03:33] because that Plank's gonna break and
[2:03:34] it's going to break your neck
[2:03:36] so don't go under that scaffold don't go
[2:03:38] on to that two stuff High whatever it is
[2:03:41] that bike's gonna fall
[2:03:45] tomorrow morning he'd go down there and
[2:03:46] he'd come and he'd remember what it was
[2:03:48] and he'd back up there goes that block
[2:03:50] he said praise be to God now that's God
[2:03:53] huh
[2:03:56] to have all prophecy and have tongues
[2:03:59] and this that or the other
[2:04:01] I'd like to have that sure but brother
[2:04:02] Brown says you know if you had your
[2:04:04] church and or if you could have gifts or
[2:04:06] whatever you'd what would you want them
[2:04:07] to have
[2:04:09] he said I would want them to have love
[2:04:11] the love of Jesus Christ
[2:04:13] amen because all these other things are
[2:04:15] perishing their people get jealous and
[2:04:17] uh people think of themselves as
[2:04:19] something
[2:04:20] huh
[2:04:23] get puffed up knowledge puffs up
[2:04:27] the Corinthians search they were always
[2:04:29] sad each other and thinking of who's
[2:04:31] going to be the greatest let me tell you
[2:04:32] something even around this message I'm
[2:04:34] afraid it's going too much around the
[2:04:36] world who's the greatest this out of the
[2:04:37] other God's not in that stuff
[2:04:40] as soon as somebody tries to be the
[2:04:41] greatest you remember God ain't there
[2:04:44] that's not God
[2:04:46] great fancy things were all equal better
[2:04:48] Bantam there's here to me brother Benham
[2:04:50] was higher than anybody by fire
[2:04:52] and he always says if you love me just
[2:04:54] call me my dear brother
[2:04:56] he didn't make himself big he could have
[2:04:58] but he didn't
[2:04:59] real big man make himself small
[2:05:01] amen
[2:05:03] but love how many believes in love is
[2:05:05] the most powerful thing amen that the
[2:05:07] church could have it's the greatest
[2:05:08] weapon that you'll overcome if you want
[2:05:10] to overcome have the love of God in your
[2:05:12] heart there's just about nothing that
[2:05:14] you can't overcome
[2:05:15] you will have long patience with one
[2:05:17] another
[2:05:19] you belong suffering you'll be kind
[2:05:21] you'll be meek amen
[2:05:24] charity suffereth long it's kind charity
[2:05:29] envious not it doesn't want what
[2:05:31] somebody else has or be like somebody
[2:05:33] else
[2:05:34] it bondeth not itself it's not puffed up
[2:05:38] it does not behave itself unseemly and
[2:05:41] it seeks not her own
[2:05:43] how many believes if you've got the Holy
[2:05:45] Ghost you are not a hermit
[2:05:48] it's not about you it's living for
[2:05:50] somebody else
[2:05:51] [Music]
[2:05:53] brother Tommy that's one of the notable
[2:05:56] things I hear you say is you know what I
[2:05:57] got I just want you to ask
[2:06:00] I want you all to know that you don't
[2:06:02] have to be bound to Bonded you don't

[2:06:11] that strike to the right person at the
[2:06:12] right time the right place they'll come
[2:06:14] forth

[2:06:19] the word of God this morning you know if
[2:06:21] the right person at the right place at
[2:06:23] the right time that word hits and

[2:06:44] stake and I was there traveling that
[2:06:46] emulation is starting right and all

[2:07:44] they weren't privileged back then
[2:07:47] no matter how many victories they had
[2:07:50] they couldn't change their nature
[2:07:53] remember Peter said
[2:07:57] that we have the promises of God has
[2:07:59] been given to us according to his divine
[2:08:01] nature
[2:08:03] how many believes that's what we want
[2:08:04] that's where the victory lays in in
[2:08:07] Christ
[2:08:08] divine nature
[2:08:11] divine nature is that godliness that
[2:08:13] patience it's that Temperance it's that
[2:08:14] knowledge it's their faith they said
[2:08:16] Mercury it said brother the kindness
[2:08:18] it just barely leaves anything out does
[2:08:21] it huh look at that it starts with faith
[2:08:24] it goes to Virtue it goes to knowledge
[2:08:26] goes to Temperance it goes patience it
[2:08:27] goes godliness it goes
[2:08:30] and you know you think that's to be a
[2:08:31] little deeper than just brotherly
[2:08:33] kindness at the top

[2:08:37] little kind
[2:08:40] how many believe we could be a little
[2:08:41] bit perhaps some more Brothers behind

[2:08:56] what that is and when you have those
[2:08:58] things and they say in you he said Peter
