Sister Grace and the girls have a special this evening. Maybe as they come, let's sing. If I could touch the hem of his garment, just start with the chorus. If I could but touch the hem of his garment. If I could but touch one part of his robe, I know I healed. My sins all forgiven. if I could. Not sure if that's on. I know I'd be whole. Sometimes I wonder, is he faithful? Does he see me in my trouble? Does he understand? Sometimes I question if he's able. Can he resue? Can he save me again and again? When I look back, did he move every mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, he did. So, yes, he did. Did he defeat the darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. So, yes, he can. Yes, he did. So, yes, he can. Sometimes those voices try to tell me I've forgotten and I've fallen too far from his hands. But I know what kind of God he is. And I'm trusting in his promises. Believing and I'm singing. Yes, he can. Did he move every mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Did he defeat the darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. So, yes, he can.

Thanks, sisters. We appreciate that. Amen. Let's sing. My God is real. He's real in my soul. There are some things I may not know. There are some places I cannot go. But I am sure of this one thing. My God is real. For I can feel him in my soul. My God is real. He is real in my soul. My God is real. For he has washed and made me whole. His love for me is like pure gold. My God is real. For I can feel him in my soul. Some folk may doubt. Some folk may scorn. All can go on and leave me alone. But as for me, I'll take God's part. And God is real. For I can't feel him in my soul. My God is real. He is real in my soul. My God is real. For he has washed and made me whole. His love for me is like pure gold. My God is real. For I can't feel him in my soul.

Lord, you're awome. My God is awesome. Awesome. Oh, awesome. He's awome. Amen. We're going to sing that second verse again. But before that, we're going to turn the service over to brother Brad this evening. And let's just sing that as he comes with this confession on our lips. My God is awesome. If you have a need this evening, when the word comes forth, he's going to be here to meet your need. Amen. If you just believe, my God is awesome. Savior of the whole world, giver of salvation. By his stripes I am healed. Oh my God is awesome. Today I am forgi. His grace is why I'm living. Praise his holy name. My God is awesome. He's awesome. He is awesome. He's awome. My God is awesome. He is awome. Awesome. He's awome. My God is awome. Hallelujah. Good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, y'all came on fire. &gt;&gt; The songs of praise just beautiful tonight. And we we thank you for that. And and uh just giving out to the Lord and pouring out. You know, so many times I I sometime myself I feel like uh I don't adequately worship. And you know, I was just looking up. I was listening to y'all sing and I thought I'm going to look up worship. And you know, it said worship can be in songs. It can be in in prayer. It can be in uh silence. And I just want to say, Lord, let me worship you tonight &gt;&gt; for what you've done for us. So we just thankful. We won't try to keep us keep you long tonight. But I do want to lay a foundation and you uh we'll be with you again Sunday morning as brother Ber will be traveling. We'll just continue to remember them and uh the Lord will grant them traveling mercies and powerful powerful meetings and that the Lord will move in miraculous ways for them up in Virginia. So uh we certainly know that he can and so we're certainly praying that that he will. So, if you would be turning in your Bibles to the book of Genesis. And like I said, we want to lay a foundation tonight if we could for Sunday. So, we will uh we will get going and try to get us uh get us in the right direction there. Forgive me there. I'm playing with technology tonight. So, um, book of Genesis chapter 22. I want to speak tonight if we could on Abraham's seed. Abraham's seed. Now, Brother Brandham tells us this. He says, "But in the depths of our heart there lays happiness because that we know that we are listen absolutely secure in Christ. You promised Abraham that you would save him and his seed and we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and are hes according to the promise by the Holy Spirit. new life coming into us, making us believe the supernatural like Abraham did. He says, "Taking God at his full value, his promise. We thank thee, oh Lord." Genesis chapter 22, and I want to kind of start there at chapter in verse 11. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said,"Abraham, Abraham." And he said, "Here I am." Now, if it looks like we're reading scriptures we just recently read, you're probably right. But but we're going in a different direction this time. Okay? And he said, "Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither thou do thou anything unto him. For now I know now I know that thou fearst God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me." And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering. Offering instead of his son and Abraham called that place Jehovah Gyra. So here we see this unconditional covenant between Abraham and God is now coming to pass. God is telling the Lord will provide and this is a promise based on the trust that that Abraham had in God. And during this hour of need, during this hour of desperation, as a proof of no matter what you're going through, no matter what the situation is in your life, you're going to trust in me like you've never trusted before. You're going to depend on me, Abraham, like you've never depended before. Because this covenant that I have made, no matter what the challenge, no matter what the obstacle, Abraham, now you can rest assured in knowing that I will from this day forward, I will supply every single one of your needs. &gt;&gt; And we can apply that as we look in the book of Acts and it says, "This promise is unto you and unto your children and all are far off as many as the Lord God shall call." Now watch. And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself I have sworn, sayaeth the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, which was a covenant promise. You haven't withheld your promise that in blessing I will bless. ABRAHAM, YOU'RE GIVING BACK TO ME. YOU'RE BLESSING ME. YOU'RE GIVING WHAT I GAVE YOU, THE VERY PROMISE, THE COVENANT, THE VERY SEED THAT I SAID WOULD WOULD MULTIPLY. YOU'RE NOW GIVING IT BACK TO ME. SO IN BLESSING, I'm going to bless thee. And in multiplying, I will multiply thy seed. Listen to that. And in multiplying, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, as the sand which are up on the seashore. And thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray tonight. Heavenly Father, we come before you, thankful, Lord, for this day you've given us and for the opportunity to get into your house once again and just to worship you in spirit and in truth. And Lord, we've heard the songs sang tonight and the songs of worship and praise. And just lifting your name on high, Lord, and the the level of dedication for people to come out tonight in the cold and the wind and misty, rainy night, Lord. And we're just thankful for the sacrifice that's made. May our sacrifices not go unseen, but be lifted up to your throne and accepted tonight, Lord. And as we've sacrificed and we've give, Lord, we just ask, Lord, that you would pour out a blessing upon us tonight, Lord. That you would help us to identify with who we are and what we're what our calling is in this hour. Lord, we just want to tell you we love you. We appreciate you, and give you all the praise and glory. And we just ask that you would have your will and way in this service in Jesus' name. You can have your seats. I do want to take a trip down through a few more scriptures if you want to have your Bibles handy so that we can get the the gist of what's going on here. So, Genesis 24. Now, if we look in Genesis 24 and 57 and 60, I want you to take notice what's happening here. Because in Genesis chapter 22, God was dealing with Abraham. God was dealing with Abraham and his seed Isaac with a covenant of multiplication. Now, in order to anything to multiply, we have math teachers here, and anything to multiply, you have to have a multiplier. So, you have to have a number and you got to have something to multiply it by. Isaac wasn't going to do this on his own. But God had a plan in place and and a and a multiplier in place. And in verse 57, it says, "They said, we call the damsel inquire at her mouth. And they called Rebecca and said unto her, "WILT THOU GO WITH THIS MAN? Will thou go with this man?" And she said, "Now, I want you to notice without hesitation," she says, "I will. I will. I WILL GO." AND THEY SENT REBECCA AWAY with her sister and her nurse and Abraham's servants and his men. And they blessed Rebecca, and said unto her, Now watch what they say unto her. This is her family speaking back to her now. And her family looks at her and and they look at her and they SAY, "THOU ART OUR SISTER, but be thou the mother of thousands of millions." Do you see the multiplier? BUT BE THOU THE MOTHER OF thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. Now, if you could pull up Psalms, we're going down through a little bit of history here and and laying this out. We look in Psalms 147, verse 1-5. It says, "Praise ye the Lord, for it is good to sing praises unto our God, for it is pleasant, and praise is comely. The Lord doth build up Jerusalem. He gather together the outcasts of Israel. He health health the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds." Now watch WHAT IT SAYS. "AND HE TELLS THE NUMBER OF THE STARS, and he calleth them all by their names." Do you see a correlation here? DO YOU SEE WHAT GOD IS DOING? HE'S TOLD HE'S I'M GOING TO MAKE I'M GOING TO number your your your seed as the stars of the sky, the sands of the sea. AND NOT ONLY AM I GOING TO NUMBER THEM, BUT I'M GOING TO KNOW EVERY SINGLE one of them THAT COMES INTO MY PRESENCE. I'M GOING TO know each and every one of them by their name. I'm going to KNOW THEIR NAME. COURTNEY, JOHN, ROY. Can you imagine the number and millions and millions and millions of people THAT HAVE BEEN DOWN THROUGH IT down through the ages HERE AND GOD KNOWS EVERY SINGLE one of them by name. &gt;&gt; And how we feel so insignificant at times. Galatians chapter 3 and then we'll get started. Galatians 3 26 says, "For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you has been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, neither bond nor free. There is neither male nor female. For ye are all one in Christ." Now, here's where we're trying to get to. And if ye be Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise. &gt;&gt; SO THE COVENANT HAD COME DOWN THROUGH AGES. IT HAD COME DOWN AS GOD SPOKE TO ABRAHAM, AS GOD MADE THE COVENANT. I'M GOING TO MULTIPLY YOU. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A SEED THAT'LL MULTIPLY MORE THAN THE STARS, MORE THAN THE SANDS, AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A GROUP OF PEOPLE. Brothers and sisters, we've been given a COVENANT AND A PROMISE IN OUR DAY THAT THE BY THE PROPHET OF THE HOUR. AND THAT COVENANT SAYS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT THE HOLY GHOST, &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to TAKE MY TIME TONIGHT, BUT IF YOU'VE GOT THE HOLY GHOST, YOU'RE GOD'S CHILD. &gt;&gt; AND BUT IF YOU'RE GOD'S CHILD, YOU'RE ABRAHAM'S SEED. AND IF YOU'RE ABRAHAM'S SEED, YOU'VE GOT AN UNCONDITIONAL COVENANT THAT IS WRITTEN INTO THE VERY HEART OF GOD ALMIGHTY HIMSELF, WHO CAN'T TAKE IT BACK. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful tonight, brothers and sisters. I'm thankful tonight how wonderful it is to know that we HAVE A GOD THAT DOESN'T GIVE AND TAKE AWAY. HE DOESN'T GIVE OVER HERE AND THEN TAKE IT AWAY because he doesn't like it anymore. &gt;&gt; You know, THAT'S WHAT WE DO. WE JUST SAY, "OH, I I'll take some of this. I'll take some of that. I'll give you this. I'll give you that." But we begin TO TAKE THINGS BACK SOMETIMES. BUT GOD DOESN'T TAKE BACK WHAT he's promised. WE HAVE EVERY PROMISE. HE SWORE HE WOULDN'T TAKE IT BACK. The word says every every word in the book is mine. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; EVERY CHAPTER, EVERY PROMISE, EVERY VERSE, EVERY LINE. The song says, "I'm trusting in his love divine." What greater love is it THAT THE THE GOD of the heavens who declared to Abraham, I'm going to give you the the your your seed will be like the offse the the the sands of the sea and the stars of the sky. And he comes DOWN HERE IN THIS HOUR AND HE SAYS, "EVERY PROMISE that I made in this book, it's yours. If you have a need in your life, it's yours BECAUSE IT'S FOR GOD'S CHILDREN. IT'S UNCONDITIONALLY. AND IT'S NOT BASED UPON OUR MERITS. THANK GOD it's not based upon our merits. It's not based upon who your daddy is. &gt;&gt; It's not based upon who your pastor is. Wouldn't it be a shame if we all had to go to one church? I think they call it Roman Catholic. H IT'S NOT BASED UPON any of those things. HOW GOOD YOU ARE, HOW PRETTY you are, how tall, how dark, how handsome, how beautiful you are. God doesn't even look at those things. But what he does look at, HE LOOKS AT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GETTING IN CHRIST. WHETHER YOU'RE ALLOWING HIM TO HAVE HIS way in your life. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT GETTING IN CHRIST IS. IT'S WHEN YOU GET YOURSELF OUT OF the way. That's what getting in Christ is getting out of the way and letting him get inside. &gt;&gt; You see, we don't deserve healing. &gt;&gt; Not a one of us in here, this is a prophet speaking, not a one of us in here even even deserve to hear the gospel. H there's not a one of you that deserves the grace of Jesus Christ. None of us. &gt;&gt; He says, "But by God's grace, he did it anyhow." &gt;&gt; You see, HE DON'T TAKE BACK WHAT HE PROMISES. &gt;&gt; So no matter where YOU'RE AT IN YOUR LIFE, IF HE'S GIVEN YOU THE LIFE ON THE INSIDE, HE'S NOT GOING TO PULL IT BACK. &gt;&gt; We're not deserving. He says, "Every one of us ought to are going to die. Me, too. We ought to die. All of us. We're not even deserve to live on this earth. &gt;&gt; Think about the insignificance that we are. But yet, we think we're so significant. How does this world even revolve without us waking up every morning? You see, that's the way we sometimes think. But we DESERVE NONE OF THIS. HE SAYS WE DON'T EVEN DESERVE to look at God's creation. Isn't it wonderful when you wake up in the morning and you look out across the the field or the yard? I hope some of you's got some some views that you can talk about. And you look out there, maybe you see the deer, you see the turkey, you see the fog coming through and you see the sunrise and how thankful we are, but how undeserving &gt;&gt; we are. But God, he said, has promised us and he cannot lie. He swore that he would do it. Healing belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Healing belongs to us. Salvation belongs to us. The Holy Ghost belongs to us. Heaven belongs to us. WHY? HE SAYS BECAUSE WE ARE THE SONS OF GOD and we're HES ACCORDING TO THE PROMISES. Sons and daughters of God. We're sitting in heavenly places and there is nothing that can harm us. What a promise. You see, we're going to make some mistakes along the way. &gt;&gt; I found that out a long time ago. We're going to make some mistakes ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE THIS human flesh that we call skin, you're going to do some things you wished you hadn't done. You're going to say some things that you wish you hadn't said. But do you know what the beautiful thing is about God? Thank God that he don't throw us out like filthy trash. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY SAY, YOU MAY DO, YOU MAY LOOK, YOU MAY SPEAK, YOU MAY SEE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO OR WISH YOU'D NEVER DONE. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT GOD SAYS. HE SAYS, "PICK YOURSELF BACK UP. DUST YOURSELF OFF. GET BACK IN LINE BECAUSE YOU'RE AN HEIR. YOU'RE NOT MADE FOR THE GARBAGE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT SO MANY TIMES PEOPLE WHEN they fall, when they make a mistake, THEY THINK, "OH MY GOODNESS, THAT'S IT." THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE A GIVE GOD A CHANCE TO PROVE THAT THAT you are an heir and that you are his. They fail to pick themselves back up. Now, you see, when you make these mistakes, it may hurt a little bit. When you make these mistakes, I it's probably going to cost you a little bit. WHEN YOU MAKE THESE MISTAKES, YOU'RE going to have to, may we say it this way, pay for it. You see, these things don't go unseen or unnoticed. But all you got to do is repent. Young people, listen to me. You're going to fall. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to have hard days. You're going to have days that you think, "There is no way I could be a Christian." Repent. REPENT. SAY, "I'M SORRY, GOD. I'M SORRY THAT I DONE THIS. I SHOULD NOT HAVE went this direction. I should not have said this or done this or or made this imp implication. God, forgive me." &gt;&gt; That settles it. Amen. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS WATCHING Abraham in his mistake. Do you realize the father, the father Abraham, we call him father Abraham, found himself making mistakes. We won't go down that rabbit hole right now with him as mistakes and Sarah's mistakes and all the mistakes that they had. We may touch on that Sunday. But now Abraham, he he did make THESE MISTAKES AND GOD MADE ABRAHAM PAY FOR IT. SO HE WASN'T GOING TO GET BY WITH IT. BUT GOD DIDN'T DIDN'T JUST CAST ABRAHAM OUT. God didn't just forget about Abraham. He made Abraham repent for it. And many times we think in our minds, I'm not worthy of healing. I'm not worthy of deliverance. I'm not worthy of happiness. I'm not worthy of a of a healthy marriage. I'm not worthy of a of a of a a productive career or job. I'm not worthy. And that's what we sometimes get in our minds that we're not worthy. And the prophet said, "WE THINK WE'RE NOT WORTHY. I'VE DONE THIS and I've done that and I've I've said this and I've done that." HE SAYS, "GET THAT OUT OF YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; GET THAT OUT OF YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; The right mental attitude &gt;&gt; TOWARDS ANY PROMISE OF God &gt;&gt; will bring it to pass." &gt;&gt; That's a direct quote. Write that one down. Let's give God a hand clap of praise. THE RIGHT MENTAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS ANY PROMISE OF GOD will bring it to pass. So get the NE GET THAT OTHER STUFF OUT OF YOUR MIND. GET IT OUT OF YOUR MIND. Sure you're not. He says you never will be, but Jesus is. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT WORTHY. YOU NEVER WILL BE. BUT JESUS IS. THAT IS WHERE WE can place our faith in tonight. That it's in the BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHERE WE ALL FIND our forgiveness. &gt;&gt; That's where we all find our salvation. It was he who paid the price, brothers and sisters. And the word says that whosoever will, let him come and drink freely, drink freely from the fountain of the waters of life. What is life? It's not you getting up every morning and putting on your britches and going to work. THAT'S NOT WHAT LIFE IS. BUT LIFE IS CHRIST ON THE INSIDE. That's the life I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S THE LIFE HE'S talking about. That whosoever will let him come drink freely from the fountain of Jesus. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you're changing the word." No, I'm not. I'm not changing the word because Jesus is the only life I ever known. You see, in my life, I was a failure. In my life, I was a renegade. That's not the fountain I'm wanting to be drinking from. In my life, I was not a I WAS NOT A PLEASANT PERSON. Thank you. &gt;&gt; He knew me BC before Christ. But when I drink from that fountain of the water of life and BROTHERS AND SISTERS, GOD BLESSES you when you drink from that fountain of THE WATER OF LIFE AND GOD BEGINS TO POUR OUT his blessings upon you and he gives you life and it's the life of Christ living on the inside of the believers. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful story. He says, "Oh, I hate to butcher up anything like this, but I hope you get what I mean. God has an unconditional covenant." And he swore by the death of Jesus Christ, he sent the Holy Ghost back up on you to be a confirmation that the covenant is made with you. So if you fall, the covenant was made for you. IF YOU'RE SICK TONIGHT, THE COVENANT WAS MADE FOR YOU. YOU IF YOU HAVE NEED OF HEALING, the covenant was made for you. If you have need of deliverance, the covenant was made for you. &gt;&gt; So if you're in a battle tonight, &gt;&gt; how many is ever in a battle? How many ever ever feels like I can't overcome this enemy and you face it day after day after day after DAY AND YOU THINK MY GOD WILL I EVER BE ABLE TO overcome this. Realize tonight you have a covenant. &gt;&gt; And you know what covenants are? They're an agreement. They're a contract that cannot be broken. You know what? I just I just Brother said I just don't we don't want ever want the devil to rob us of what's rightfully ours. Because he comes and he takes and he takes and he takes. Why would I want to give him anything else? Do you realize that? Because God has given me in a covenant given me a covenant that I DON'T HAVE TO BE SUBJECT to the things of the devil. He says, "Listen, you are a covenant people of God. God tore Christ apart at Calvary. You know, back in the day, they would take a they would take a a a skin, an animal hide, and when they were going to make a covenant, they would go in there and they would make an agreement. We're going to we're going to agree on this, and we're going to agree on that, and this is the way we're going to do business." and they would tear that animal hide. One partner would take one piece of hide, one partner would take another piece of hide. And if there was ever any question, and they wrote down what the rules of the covenant were on the hide, I won't do this. I won't do that. I will do this. I will do that. I will read my Bible and pray. I will I will worship you. I will praise you. I won't give myself to idol mindness, but I will serve you. And they tear that covenant. And if there's ever a question on the agreement, they say, "Hey, come here. We had an agreement. We made an agreement at the altar when we tore this hide and you told me that you wouldn't do this. you told me that YOU WOULD YOU WOULD GIVE ALL that you had until our agreement. And they bring those. He said, "Well, I don't know. I don't know if I really agreed to that. Hand me your hide." And they lay the two hides together. And as those two hides begin to the tear marks begin to line up, the words that was written across them begin to reveal. This is the covenant you made. You can't break this covenant. Brothers and sisters, God don't place us under a contract, so to speak. But he does give us a covenant. He gives us a way to serve him, a way to love him, a way a way that we can that we can be loved. AND CHRIST TOOK THE BODY UP and he took the body up into heaven after he took him up to Calvary making a coven swearing by him. He took him up into heaven that he would return someday. But the spirit is what he gave back to lead the church. &gt;&gt; We need the leading of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; because any church that is not led by the Holy Spirit is not going to stand. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO WITHSTAND ALL THE ENEMIES that's coming in and and this that and THE OTHER. IT CANNOT DO IT. SO, we need the leading of the Holy Spirit. THE SAME LIFE THAT WAS IN CHRIST IS IN the church by the Holy Spirit. And watch what he said it's doing. He said it is doing it is acting. It is performing the same things that he did when he was back here on earth. I think that's our church. And once you've received it, you've got the covenant. It is written to you, swore by God. And listen TO THIS. YOU CANNOT FAIL. Those are powerful words. So when YOU'VE GOT THIS HABIT THAT YOU JUST CAN'T OVERCOME, PUT IT IN BEFORE GOD AND SAY, "HERE IS A COVENANT that you made with me, God, THAT YOU SAID IF I WOULD DEPEND ON YOU, IF I would lay my burdens down at the altar, you made a covenant that you would take control of the situation." &gt;&gt; And because of that, I cannot fail. &gt;&gt; And listen what he said. He says, "This makes the devil mad." And it sure does because it's when you realize who you are. &gt;&gt; You know, listen, I'm I'm going to just stop here for just a minute and tell you a little something that happened. You know, people going to criticize. Well, if you ain't being criticized, you ain't doing nothing. People are going to criticize. People are going to mock. But that doesn't change who we are in Christ. Funny story. I I found it funny. I I don't know. Let's just go with it. So, Sister Jana puts out a clip when I was preaching and some comments started to show up on it. And this one guy says,"Great speech, but what are you going to do when this comes into the church and this because it was it was kind of it was kind of a a a lifting up putting you in your position. This is who we are. This is what we can have. This is what we can achieve through Christ." The clip that she put out and this guy begins to criticize. Great speech. What are you going to do when when homosexuals come in? when this comes in and when that comes in, what are you going to say to those people? In other words, why are you just preaching positivity? WHY ARE YOU JUST CALLING PEOPLE AND TELLING THEM WHO they are and what they what their abilities are in Christ? I will tell you why. Would you look around at your neighbor and see if we have any other problems? Do you see a problem with immorality? Do you see a problem with modesty? Do you see a problem with with split homes marriages? Do you see a bunch of rebels? Do you see the homosexuals? But I will assure you it would be preached on. But we are so I don't want to say so far down the road. We shouldn't be dwelling on THOSE THINGS. MODESTY SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING WE HAVE TO HARP ON EVERY SUNDAY, every Wednesday, every Sunday, and every Sunday night. YOU'VE HEARD THAT FOR 25, 40, 50 YEARS. BUT NOW WE'RE GETTING TO A PLACE WHERE GOD IS CALLING US INTO A POSITION TO LET US KNOW WHO WE ARE. SO THAT'S WHY THE MINISTRY HAS TAKEN THE turn that IT'S TAKEN IS TO SHOW YOU THAT YOU HAVE been adopted AND THAT YOU ARE AN heir of Christ. &gt;&gt; So people's going to criticize but but the word TELLS US THAT WE'RE JOINT AIRS WITH CHRIST TONIGHT. SO WHAT IS AN HEIR? WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WORD HEIR, I want you to think of this definition. a person legally entitled to the property or rank of another on that person's death. Let me read that to you again. Should have been a few amens there. A person that is legally entitled to the property or rank of another on that person's death. A person inheriting and continuing the legacy of a predecessor. You know, the legacy I leave behind won't be anything Brad Pal. The legacy that you leave behind won't be anything that you've done. But the I want the legacy that I leave behind be the legacy of my predecessor. I want the legacy that I live to be just what the LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST WAS. I want to love my neighbor. I want to be able TO GIVE TO OTHERS. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE MYSELF AS AS a servant of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You see in ancient Israel, he airship was governed by the law. And the reason it was governed by the law is because it was to preserve the family land and the lineage of the family. And the Bible says that we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and are hes with Abraham. SO WHEN WE ARE DEAD IN CHRIST, brothers and sist a when we die in Christ, think about this, a spiritual union begins to take place. SO WHEN WE DIE OUT to ourselves, WHEN WE DIE OUT TO our own ideas and we move ourselves out of the way and we make room for Christ on the inside, we then become what we call Christian. CHRISTIAN MEANS WE ARE BELIEVERS. IT MEANS WE'RE SAVED. It means we're Christlike. Did you hear what I said? When you get yourself out of the way and make room for Christ, YOU THEN ARE A CHRISTIAN who is Christlike. And then we WHICH ARE IN CHRIST ARE CHRISTIANS ARE CHRISTLIKE. IT MEANS WE ARE BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE AN HEIR TO SALVATION. YOU'RE AN HEIR TO REDEMPTION. YOU ARE AN HEIR TO BE AN OVERCOMER AND VICTORY IS YOURS. Christ is the royal seed of Abraham. Listen to this. Christ is the royal seed of Abraham. And out of Abraham come Isaac. And out of Isaac Jacob. And out of Jacob Joseph. And Joseph. And on down and down David. And David. And so on. AND SO ON. UNTIL FINALLY THE ROYAL seed was born which was Christ. And in Christ the covenant of Abraham was confirmed to the people and was given to the people unconditionally. Now brothers and sisters when we know this that that is the only thing we have to do is to accept the promise we begin to find out that and to inherit all of the promises of God. All we have to do is to stay on the word. You see, when we get off the word, that's when we get on back onto ourselves. But in order to be an heir, you have to stay right there and be adopted into the life of Christ and adopted into the home &gt;&gt; by staying on the word. You see, in the Old Testament, we're going to go over adoption real quick. In the Old Testament, in the in the story of adoption, when a child was born into a family, that child is say it was a boy, and he comes up and and and we find out that he's an heir, of course, because he's the firstborn son of a father or a businessman or whatever. So he is heir. But that CHILD WAS NOT FULLY an heir of all things that his father had before he came into power. He has to first be put under a tutor. HE HAS TO FIRST BE PUT UNDER a tutor. And this tutor begins to raise this son. And the tutor was a man that the father searched out diligently. I'M GOING TO FIND THE best man I can to raise my son. I'm going to find the the one who will tell the truth, the one who will reveal exactly what he has need of to make him heir of my throne. Huh? So, HE'S GOING TO FIND THE BEST MAN HE CAN. And brothers and sisters, do you realize we have been under a tremendously great tutor in this hour? We have been under a tutor in this hour WHO HAS TRAINED US, WHO HAS TAUGHT US, AND HAS REVEALED to us the very mind of Christ. But before he could come into his inheritance, what did God have to do? He had TO BE ABLE TO TRUST HIM. He had TO BE ABLE TO TRUST THE PROPHET. SO THE PROPHET HAD TO SIT under a tutor here. AND EVERYTHING THAT THIS TUTOR TOLD HIM, he did &gt;&gt; to A POINT THAT GOD WAS ABLE TO TRUST HIM, THAT GOD WAS ABLE TO PUT CONFIDENCE IN HIM AND USE HIM. THAT'S WHY THE FATHER WANTED the best tutor for his son because he didn't want him to fall, but he wanted him to inherit all things. So this tutor, the prophet tells a story and it's it it's really good. He tells a story. He's talking about the tutor and he says that he wants a tutor that'll not tell a lie and say your church is doing fine. I think that's kind of the direction that guy was making those comments towards. I tell him, "Look around." I challenge him. Look around. We don't have to lie about it. We don't have to We don't have to fluff everybody up. you. WHAT ABOUT A TUTOR THAT WILL SAY, "YOUR SON'S DOING just fine when he isn't. He's a little rascal." That's too much to The trouble today is too many of our bishops and so forth with our man-made tutors. Man-made tutors. How many churches, how many denominations is it in the in the world now? 47,000. Is that right? 47. It was 44,000. I think it's went up to 47,000. So, if you're anybody at all with some kind of idea, you could have a church. You could have a church. You could have a following. You know what? Is this day and age we're living in? Everybody wants followers. &gt;&gt; Like and subscribe. Follow me. We're trying TO REACH A MILLION FOLLOWERS. IF WE CAN REACH A MILLION FOLLOWERS, I'M GOING TO GIVE EVERYBODY A FREE PENCIL. I'm not looking for followers. I'm looking to be a servant. &gt;&gt; I'M LOOKING TO BE WHAT GOD WANTS ME TO BE SO THAT I CAN BE HEIR TO ALL that he is. Yeah. &gt;&gt; AND THIS TUTOR COMES IN HERE and and can you imagine what it WOULD BE LIKE TO HAVE A HAVE A HAVE A TUTOR that could couldn't even go back and see the father and tell him how good his son was doing. So the father gets the best tutor that he could find, the best razor. How the tutor must have blushed when he had to walk up in front of the father and say, "Oh, your son." Can you imagine this situation? The tutor walks up. Oh, let me tell you about your son. Oh. And the father says, "Oh, how is he?" Well, is he doing okay? Well, your son is He's genius, isn't he? Well, he's horrible. Your son is horrible. Uh he's a little bit, how could I say, in his own headed way. He's kind of hard-headed. You see, we can't be hard-headed Christians. But so many times people come to church and the preacher has to Why? Because they want to go their own way. They know the word. They know the truth. They know They hear the preachers reading it. They hear the PREACHER TELLING THEM EXACTLY THE TRUTH, word for word, but yet they want to do their own thing. That's what we call hard-headed. &gt;&gt; Sometimes my wife said, "I'm glad when that whoever it is gets what you're trying to say. cuz you and brother Ber have been saying it for six months now. SO THAT TUTOR MUST HAVE blushed that tutor must must have blushed at the hard-headedness of this kid. And the tutor comes down here now and he says, "Oh, if that child was just like the father. IF THAT CHILD WAS JUST LIKE THE FATHER, MY EVERYTHING THE FATHER SAID." YES. He said, "Amen. We pay our tithes." Amen. We come to church when the doors are open. Amen. Oh, now we got something to smile about. We dress modestly. Amen. Men are head of the house. Amen. Christ is head of the man. &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? And this TUTOR COMES AND HE TELLS THE FATHER, "HE'S JUST LIKE YOU. HE'S JUST LIKE YOU. YOUR SON IS A WONDERFUL BOY. JUST HE LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU. THE THINGS THAT you do, that's exactly what he does. &gt;&gt; He said, "You know, there's some bosses out there and some superintendants out there, and when he walks OUT THERE, HE DON'T EVEN PAY HIM ANY ATTENTION. IT DOESN'T EVEN BOTHER HIM. HE STANDS THERE JUST LIKE you do. He knows who he is." How many of us know who we are tonight? So when WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN Satan comes, we we could say that old the old straw master as as the prophet tells the old straw boss comes there and he's trying to dictate and tell you what to do. How many of you is going to just pay him no attention and say, "I know who my father is. &gt;&gt; I stand here because I know who my father is and and because I know who my father is, I am heir to everything that he is." how that FATHER MUST LOOK AT HIM WHEN THAT TUTOR COMES AND SAYS all those good things AND HE SAYS, "OH, THAT'S my son. I am so proud of him SO MUCH THAT SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO SHOW THE world that he's my son." Do you realize when when when we do the things that God wants us to do, it puts a little smile on his face? DO YOU REALIZE THAT WHEN WHEN WHEN YOU OVERCOME SOME OF THE CHALLENGES that we have to overcome, God just steps back and says, "That's my son. I'M SO PROUD OF HIM. LOOK AT WHAT he's done. LOOK AT WHAT HE'S ACCOMPLISHED. LOOK AT HOW HE'S PUT THE DEVIL IN HIS PLACE." HE DON'T LET THE DEVIL rule him. He rules the devil. This same son born into the family, his name is no good on the check until he checks out. You know, a lot of times we want to we want things to happen and we we hear the story and we hear the preaching on the checkbook. Just sign your name. Sign sign the sign what you want. But you better be adopted. YOU BETTER BE ADOPTED into the into the into the into Christ. You see, because when that time comes for the LAW OF ADOPTION, THE FATHER HAS TO TAKE HIS SON OUT into the public place AND HE SETS HIM up on this up on a a platform, we might say, and he puts a a robe of a dressing upon him of a certain robe and performs a task of what we call the placing of a son or the law of adoption. He says, "Now when this son is adopted into his own family, from then on, how many has got the Holy Spirit?" From then on, if you was able to raise your hand, from then on, from then on, he's adopted into this family. From then on, the son is given power. From then on, he's gifted. From then on, his name IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FATHER'S is on the check. So, when you've got the Holy Ghost and you've been given them the checkbook, from then on, you sign whatever you want. Your name is as good as his name. He says, and because he's the boss, he's over the straw bosses now. You don't have to walk in fear. You don't have to walk in anxiety. You don't have to walk in depression. You don't have to walk in torment. You don't have to walk in SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. WHY? BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE THE BOSS of the straw boss. And that's exactly he says what God did with his own son. Think about this these laws and how this all begins to play out from the very beginning. He had to take his own son and he proved him in every way he could. He took him up on the mountain and said, "If you'll do this, you can have all of this. And if you're hungry, all you got to do is speak and it'll be given." And he tempted HIM IN EVERY SINGLE WAY POSSIBLE. AND HE TRIED HIM AND HE proved him in everything. And in St. Matthew, he took him up on a mount. AND UP ON THAT MOUNTAIN THERE BECAME AN OVERSHADOW of a cloud of glory upon him. And so CHRIST IS NOW THERE in a raignment and the sun shined and in his arignment AND A VOICE COMES OUT OF heaven where Peter, James and John heard a voice and it said this is my beloved. This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; THAT IS ADOPTION. EVERYTHING that we have to say through adoption, JESUS WENT THROUGH IT. THAT was what Abraham's seed was. It wasn't Isaac. Yeah, sure it was Isaac and Jacob and David and on down and down, but the real seed, the real inheritance, IT WAS JESUS CHRIST COMING ON THE SCENE AND dying for you and me. You see, adoption provides the believers with the same legal rights and privileges as a natural-born child, specifically on the status of an heir. And it's because of Christ sacrifice. That's what buys the believer. IT'S UPON THAT SACRIFICE THAT BUYS THE BELIEVER OUT OF SLAVERY. You don't have to be in BONDAGE ANYMORE. IT'S BY THAT SACRIFICE THAT BUYS US OUT OF SIN. WE DON'T HAVE TO FALL TO THOSE SINFUL THINGS AND a sinful way of living anymore. &gt;&gt; It's because of that that we're bought. We're bought for a price that WE'RE BOUGHT OUT OF THE BONDAGE OF THIS HELLISH world that we live in. DO YOU REALIZE ONE DAY we're going to step take one step and we're going to step into eternity? &gt;&gt; That was bought. As an adopted believer, you receive a spirit of adoption. Can you imagine? I I I wasn't adopted. I don't think. No, I wasn't. I'm I'm just I'm not. But can you imagine being adopted and now you have been brought into a family under a spirit of adoption that you're no longer an orphan. You're no longer lost out into the world. You're no longer being tossed from this place and that place and over here and over there. But but by the spirit of adoption, you've been brought into a family, into a home, into a into a godship that you can now say, "Aba, Father." Think about that. Can you imagine not ever being able to call anybody dad? Anybody Anybody daddy? Maybe some have. I'm there's plenty that have. I know. But when YOU GOT THAT SPIRIT OF ADOPTION THAT comes in, it allows you that INTIMATE DEGREE WITH GOD TO WHERE YOU CAN SAY, "ABA, FATHER," which is a means interpreted as papa. It's intimate. It's a relationship. Papa, daddy. And now that you've got THAT ABBA FATHER, IT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A CLOSENESS between you and him. UNDER THE SPIRIT OF ADOPTION, YOU BECOME SO CLOSE TO GOD. You become so close that YOU BECOME SO DEPENDENT AND YOU LOVE NOT JUST REVERENCE some kind of distant figure. Not a GOD OFF IN HISTORY, NOT A GOD OFF ON on Calvary or a God that that rose FROM THE DEAD, BUT NOW YOU'RE SITTING FACE TO FACE, arm in arm and looking up eye to eye say, "Aba, Father, &gt;&gt; I love you, Papa. I love you, Papa. For once I was lost, but you you found me. For once, I was astray. Once I was running through the for the things of the of the world, and I didn't have a home. I didn't have I didn't have a shelter. I didn't have food. I didn't have Raymond. But aba, Father, Papa, you took me in. You clothed me. You housed me. You forgave me. Aba father. Jesus when the garden OF GETHSEMANE HE SAYS aba father if it be your will let this cup pass. Aba father. AND IN TALKING ABOUT ADOPTION PAUL WRITES that the believers receive the spirit of ADOPTION AND IT ALLOWS YOU AND IT it enables you to CRY ABBA FATHER. AND PAUL SAYS THAT IS TO SIGNIFY A NEW IDENTITY. I'M no longer who I was. I'm a new creation in Christ. So now with the spirit on the inside, I can now cry aba father. Romans 8:14 says believers are joint hes with Christ. Galatians 4:47 says God sent his son to redeem those under the law to receive adoption. Ephesians 5 1 and5 says God predestinated believers for the adoption according to his pleasure and his will. You say, "Man, you you really on adoption TONIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING YOU KNOW MOSES was adopted?" SURE. MOSES WAS ADOPTED. IT TELLS US RIGHT there in Exodus. It says the child grew as she brought him into Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. HE BECAME HER SON. SO, WHILE SHE WAS OUT BATHING IN THE NILE, Pharaoh's daughter uh is out there bathing in the vial. She notices A LITTLE PAPYRUS BASKET UP ON the reeds. And she goes down there and she picks up this little basket, open it up, and what does she find but a crying baby that was us before adoption, a bunch of crying babies. and she looks at this crying baby and she and Moses's sister Miriam says, "Hey, I I'll go find you a Hebrew woman who can nurse this child." And the princess agrees, unknowingly hiring Moses's real mother, &gt;&gt; Jockabed. AND SO JOCKABED NOW COMES AND SHE BEGINS TO CARE FOR MOSES AND through his early childhood. But once he grew older, about the age of two or three, he was brought back into the palace where the princess officially adopted him as her son. NOW I WANT YOU TO watch this. She named him Moses, which means in in Hebrew to draw out and in Moses in Egyptian means son. to draw out my son. Esther, you see, you don't think about these people, do you? We think about adoption. We don't think about these people. Here was Esther adopted by her cousin Mori. The Bible says he brought her up. He brought up Hadassa, that is Esther, his uncle's daughter, for she had neither father nor mother. She was uh and was made for was fair and beautiful for whom Mordei when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter. So here's Esther. NOW ESTHER'S PARENTS DIE leaving her as an orphan. How many times have we ever felt orphaned? SURE WE HAVE. WE FELT MANY TIMES LIKE, "DOES ANYBODY CARE? Does anybody hear? Does anybody know? Am I still living and walking? Can anybody see me?" An orphan. And so here's Esther now, an orphaned, an orphan body. AND MORI TAKES her in to raise her in his own home. Aren't you thankful we have a house of God that we can come IN AND SAY, "I'M GOING TO GOD'S HOUSE, AND I AM A WELCOMED CHILD THERE. THAT I CAN SET I CAN PULL UP TO THE TABLE of the pull pit and hear and be fed and feed on the word of God as it comes forth. &gt;&gt; Esther, you know what her name means? I just can't help it. I hope you can see the picture. Star. Abraham's seed will be as the stars of the sky. Jacob's grandsons. Jacob adopted I don't know if you realize it, but he adopted Ephraim and Manass as his own. You say, "Well, I thought that was Joseph's boys." And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee in Egypt, are mine. Are mine as Reuben and Simeon, they are mine. So Jacob now declared that Ephraim and Manass would be his. HE WAS TAKING AN ADOPTION PLACE AND HE WAS PLACING them on equal legal footing with his own two eldest sons, Reuben and Simeon. Think about this. AND HERE WE SEE THIS ADOPTION took place towards the end of his life. And Joseph brings his two sons to Jacob at his bedside when he hears how he's ill and how he's dying. And here Jacob tells him that if any of your future children born to Joseph would remain Joseph's heir. He brings those two sons here. LISTEN, HE BRINGS THOSE TWO sons there, Ephraim and Manassth. Now, keep in mind that traditionally there is a double portion of blessings upon the firstborn. Any of the firstborn, they get a double portion of the inheritance. But because Reuben had forfeited his birth or his birthright to due to misconduct, Jacob now transfers his double portion to Joseph by elevating his two sons. Are you with me? Here we are preserving a covenant. We're preserving an identity. These two boys were born in Egypt to an Egyptian mother, Asani. and they were born there. But adoption placed them fully integrated into the covenant family of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. It took them out of that old Egyptian culture. You see, you may have been born out into the world. You may have been born speaking lies. But when AN ADOPTION TAKES PLACE AND GOD LAYS HIS hand on you, you receive a double portion from heaven. And that double portion SAYS THAT YOU'RE NOW A SON or daughter of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. No longer Egyptian, crossing of his hands. He crossed his hands and through Manasse, although Manassus was the was the firstborn, Jacob crossed his hands and he places his right hand on the of the primary blessing on the younger one, Ephraim. And he places his hand on Ephraim and his left hand on Manass. When we look at this, WE SEE THAT DESPITE JOSEPH, JOSEPH SAID, "NO, NO, NO, FATHER. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? This is not right. This was the firstborn." and and and Jacob looks at him and says, "While Manasseh will be a great people, Ephraim will be even greater." This prophecy was fulfilled as we see the tribe of Ephraim became the most influential tribe in the northern kingdom of Israel. Do you realize that adoption plays such a major part in our lives? To be adopted into the into the into the family of God, to be adopted into Christ, to be under that shed blood, to be with in Christ and allow Christ to dwell and move and be in our lives and in our families and in our homes and in our jobs. You know, I I feel like I repeat that a lot, but I don't repeat that to be repetitive, but I say that because it's the truth. It is the truth. WHERE WOULD WE BE WITHOUT GOD IN OUR LIVES? &gt;&gt; Thank God for adoption. Musicians, why don't you make your way up? Isaiah 43. We'll read this here as we close. But now, thus says the Lord, he who created you, he who formed you, fear not, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by name. and you are mine. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet tonight. I have called you by name. Glenn, Debbie, Sarah, put your name there. We could go through the whole list, but it's not your neighbor's name. He says, "I called you by name and you are mine." Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we come before you tonight, Lord, with grateful hearts. Lord, trust this service, Lord, was edifying to the body. I know it was more teaching a lot of scriptures and just laying foundation, Father. But Lord, we need foundational preaching and teaching because teaching is what places us. It It allows us to be able to see who we are. It leads us. It guides us. It brings to our awareness the lives that we're living and what's going on around us and how we can tie it back through the scriptures. And when we think about the promise that was made to Abraham and his covenant that was made, it was a covenant that the promise that could never be broken. It was a covenant of promises that gives us deliverance. It gives us freedom. It gives us an assurance in this hour to know that we're one of yours. And whatever we have need of, our needs will be met. Our supplies will be there for you supply all our needs, Lord. Lord, in an hour when we see the news and the shakiness of what's going on in the world and and we we just don't know. It's going so fast you can't even keep up with it. Rumors of war, wars, dictators coming coming to head, dictators being cast aside, new leadership, peace, peace, trading oil. Millions and millions of barrels of oil are being traded. You say, "What's that got to do?" It's got to do with a lot. When you study the message in the hour we're living in, when they cry peace, peace, and there's war and rumors of war, and when when they go for that oil. So Lord, we just want to find our place in you tonight. We want to accept the full adoption for the hour that we're living in and receive all the promises of Abraham's seed. We love you, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. All things are passed away. I've been born again. More than a coner. That's what I am. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. All things are passed away. I've been born again. More than a coner. That's what I am. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. There are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all a flame with the fire that fell at Pentecost which then made them clean. Oh, it is burning now within my heart. All glory to his name. And I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Although these people may not learn to be nor boast of worldly fame, they have all received their Pentecost, baptized in Jesus name, and are telling now both far and wide, his power is yet the same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. with all your hearts. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Oh, victory is mine. Victory is mine. Victory today is mine. And I to get thee behind. Cuz victory today is mine. Well, joy is mine. Oh, joy is mine. I know that joy is mine. And I told Satan to get me behind cuz joy today is mine. Oh, and I told Satan to get thee behind. For peace today is mine. When victory is mine, victory is mine. Victory today is mine. And I told Satan to get thee behind for victory today is mine. Oh, and love is mine. Love is mine. Love today is mine. Oh, and I told Satan to get thee behind. For love today is mine. Oh, and when I woke this morning, oh, I didn't have no doubt cuz I knew that the Lord would bring me out. And so I got down on my knees. I said, "Lord, help me please." I got up singing, shouting the victory. Oh, I'm singing, "Victory is mine." Victory is mine. Oh, victory today is mine. Oh, and I told Satan to get me behind. For victory today is mine when I rose this morning. Oh, and when I rose this morning, oh, I didn't have no doubt cuz I knew that the Lord would bring me out. And so I got down on my knees, said, "Lord, help me please." I got up singing and shouting, "The victory." Oh, singing, "Victory is mine. Victory is mine. Victory today is mine." Oh, and I told Satan to get thee behind. For victory today is mine. Amen. Amen. I think that's a good confession to end the night on. Amen. So, we're just going to sing that again as we're dismissed this evening. Amen. Shake hands with somebody. Say, "God bless you. It's good to see you this evening." Amen. We'll see you on Sunday, Lord willing, and at 10:30. Oh, when victory is mine. Oh, victory is mine. Victory today
