[38:11] you can turn to Luke 24 we're just going
[38:14] to read the whole chapter here
[38:18] now up on the first day of the week very
[38:21] early in the morning there came into the
[38:24] sub score bringing the spices which they
[38:26] had prepared and certain others with
[38:28] them
[38:29] and they found the stone rolled away
[38:31] from this
[38:33] and they entered in and found not the
[38:36] body of the Lord Jesus
[38:38] and it came to pass as they were
[38:41] much perplexed thereabout behold two men
[38:44] stood by them in shining garments as
[38:47] they were afraid and bowed down their
[38:49] faces to the Earth
[38:51] they said unto them why seek ye to live
[38:54] and among the Dead
[38:55] he is not here but he is risen remember
[38:58] how he's spake unto you when he was yet
[39:01] in
[39:03] okay
[39:08] saying the son of man must be delivered
[39:10] unto the hands of simple men and be
[39:12] crucified and the third day
[39:15] rise again
[39:16] and they remembered his words and
[39:18] returned from the Sepulcher and told all
[39:21] these things unto the eleven and to all
[39:24] the rest it was Mary Magdalene and Jonah
[39:27] and Mary the mother of James and other
[39:30] women that were with them which told
[39:32] these
[39:36] and their words seemed to them as Idle
[39:39] as tales and they believed them not then
[39:41] a rose Peter and ran unto the supper and
[39:45] stooping down he beheld the linen
[39:47] clothes
[39:47] laid by themselves and departed
[39:50] wandering in himself at that which was
[39:52] to come to pass and behold two of them
[39:55] went that same day to a village called
[39:58] Emmaus and which was from Jerusalem
[40:01] about three score four loans
[40:04] and they talked together for all these
[40:06] things which had happened and it came to
[40:08] pass that while they communed together
[40:10] in reason Jesus himself
[40:14] Drew near and went with them but their
[40:17] eyes were holding that they should not
[40:19] know him and he said unto them what
[40:21] manner of communications are these that
[40:23] ye have one to another as ye walk and
[40:27] are sad and the one of them whose name
[40:29] was cleopius answering said unto him art
[40:33] thou not only a stranger in Jerusalem
[40:35] and has not known these things which are
[40:38] come to pass there in these days and he
[40:41] said unto them what things and they said
[40:43] unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth
[40:46] which was a prophet Mighty in the deed
[40:49] and word before God and all the people
[40:51] and how Chief priests and our rulers
[40:55] delivered him to be condemned to death
[40:58] and have crucified him but we trusted
[41:02] that it had been he which
[41:05] should have redeemed Israel and beside
[41:08] all this today is the third day since
[41:10] these things were done
[41:12] yea and the certain woman also of our
[41:14] company made
[41:16] as astonished which were early at the
[41:18] Sepulcher and when they found not his
[41:21] body they came saying that they had also
[41:25] seen a vision of angels
[41:27] which said that he was alive and certain
[41:30] of them which were with us went to the
[41:33] Sepulcher and found it even as so as the
[41:36] women had said but with
[41:38] but him they said saw and on then he
[41:40] said unto them o fools and slow of heart
[41:43] to believe all that the prophets have
[41:45] spoken
[41:47] ought not Christ who has suffered these
[41:49] things
[41:49] and to enter into his glory
[41:52] and being at the beginning at Moses and
[41:54] all the prophets he expounded unto them
[41:57] in all the scriptures that these things
[42:00] concerned in him
[42:02] self
[42:03] and they drew not into the village
[42:05] whether
[42:06] they went and he made it as though he
[42:09] would have gone further but they
[42:10] constrained him saying abide with us for
[42:13] it is toward evening and the day is far
[42:15] spent and he went in to tarry with them
[42:18] and it came to pass as he sat and meet
[42:21] with them and he took bread and blessed
[42:23] it and breaked it and gave to them and
[42:26] their eyes were open and they knew him
[42:29] he vanished out of their sight and they
[42:32] said to one another do not
[42:35] our heart burn within us while he talked
[42:38] with us by the way and while he opened
[42:41] to his to us his the scriptures and they
[42:44] arose up the same hour and returned to
[42:46] Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered
[42:49] together
[42:50] and them that were with them saying the
[42:53] Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared
[42:56] to Simon and they told what these things
[43:00] were done in the way and how he was
[43:03] known of them in breaking up bread and
[43:06] as the day thus beg Jesus himself stood
[43:09] in the midst of them and said unto them
[43:12] and peace be
[43:14] unto you
[43:15] but they were terrified and frightened
[43:17] and supposed that they had seen his
[43:20] spirit
[43:21] and he said unto them why are key
[43:24] trouble and why do thoughts arise in
[43:26] your hearts behold my hands and my feet
[43:28] that it is I myself handle me and see
[43:32] for a spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as
[43:34] you see me have
[43:36] and when he had thus spoken and showed
[43:39] him his hands and his feet and while
[43:42] they yet believe not for Joy he wondered
[43:46] he said unto them have ye hear any meat
[43:50] and they gave him a piece of a boiled
[43:53] fish and of in a honeycomb and he took
[43:56] it and he did eat before them and he
[43:59] said unto them these are the words which
[44:02] I speak unto that
[44:04] all things must be fulfilled which were
[44:07] written in the law of Moses and in the
[44:10] prophets and in the Psalms concerning me
[44:12] then opened he their understanding that
[44:15] they might understand the scriptures and
[44:17] said unto them thus it is written and
[44:19] thus it behoothed Christ has suffer and
[44:22] to rise from the dead the third day
[44:24] and that repentance and remissions of
[44:27] sin should be preached in his name among
[44:30] all nations beginning at Jerusalem and
[44:33] year witness of these things and behold
[44:35] a sin the promise of my father upon you
[44:37] but Terry in one city of Jerusalem until
[44:41] ye be endued with the power from on high
[44:44] and he led him out as far as to Bethany
[44:47] and he lifted up his hands and blessed
[44:50] him they came to pass while he blessed
[44:52] them he was parted from them and carried
[44:55] up into heaven and they worshiped him
[44:57] and returned to Jerusalem with great joy

[1:33:04] um and if you'll notice in chapter 5 how
[1:33:08] it talks about that there was a uh John
[1:33:12] Saul on the right hand of him that sat
[1:33:13] on the throne a book that was sealed
[1:33:17] with it on the backside and so forth in
[1:33:19] the strong angel of course verse 2
[1:33:21] proclaiming who is worthy to open the
[1:33:24] book and to loosen the seals thereof
[1:33:26] Amen in verse 2 3 it says and no man in
[1:33:29] heaven no under the Earth was able to to
[1:33:33] open the book neither to look thereon
[1:33:35] and John wept much amen and I thought
[1:33:38] about this scripture about how that John
[1:33:41] uh in between here he says nobody was
[1:33:44] worthy to open or even look on it and
[1:33:46] John began to weep and I thought it was
[1:33:49] a kind of a time of of expectation it
[1:33:54] kind of uh in between like when
[1:33:56] something was going to happen and we
[1:33:58] were all standing in awe and wondering
[1:34:01] what was going to happen here John was
[1:34:02] weeping because nobody was worthy to
[1:34:05] take this book amen and it was kind of
[1:34:07] like a resurrection between last Friday
[1:34:10] and the Sunday morning no doubt but
[1:34:12] there was much of distress that went on
[1:34:15] with the disciples and so forth and they
[1:34:17] were all wondering which way they're
[1:34:19] going to go which we know that they all
[1:34:21] were in their separate ways and they
[1:34:22] forsook Christ and man that they were
[1:34:25] all in some law but there was a time of
[1:34:27] wondering whether you know what he said
[1:34:29] would come come to pass when he raised
[1:34:31] from the dead and all of heaven and all
[1:34:33] of Earth was standing it on waiting to
[1:34:36] see if he would come up again and job I
[1:34:39] believe said you know what if a man dies
[1:34:41] shall he rise again and so forth he
[1:34:43] looked to the tree and he saw that when
[1:34:45] it goes down in the ground it comes back
[1:34:47] but but a man he talks about he goes
[1:34:49] away and he never comes back but all of
[1:34:51] creation was looking for a man that
[1:34:53] could say I have the power to lay my
[1:34:55] life down and I have time I have the
[1:34:57] power to raise it back up and it was
[1:34:59] kind of a moment of silence so to speak
[1:35:02] amen an expectation and that's kind of
[1:35:04] what I see this as an expectation and
[1:35:07] also weeping because nobody was found
[1:35:10] worthy because no man was found worthy
[1:35:12] to open or to read the book needed to
[1:35:14] look their own and one of the elders
[1:35:16] said unto me wheat not behold the line
[1:35:19] of the tribe of Judah the root of David
[1:35:21] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[1:35:23] lose the Seven Seals thereof and I
[1:35:26] beheld now notice his looks and look and
[1:35:29] I and lo and the midst of the throne and
[1:35:31] of the four beasts in the midst of the
[1:35:33] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:35:38] amen praise be the God Amen having seven
[1:35:42] heads and seven horns seven eyes which
[1:35:44] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:35:46] into all the world and he came and
[1:35:48] opened a book rather took the book out
[1:35:50] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:35:51] the throne
[1:35:52] and when he had taken the book The Four
[1:35:54] beasts and 20 Elders fell down before
[1:35:56] the lamb having every one of them Harps
[1:35:58] and golden vials full of odors which are
[1:36:01] the prayers of the Saints how many
[1:36:02] believe that your prayers don't go to
[1:36:05] waste amen amen
[1:36:09] and they sang a new song saying Thou Art
[1:36:12] Worthy praise the Lord our Series has
[1:36:14] been on being worthy the worthy one amen
[1:36:17] how many believe that the lamb that was
[1:36:19] slain was Worthy amen and he talks about
[1:36:22] having been redeemed out of every
[1:36:23] Kindred tongue and nation and so forth
[1:36:25] verse 11 and I beheld and I heard the
[1:36:28] voice of many angels round about the
[1:36:30] throne and the beasts and the elders and
[1:36:32] the number of them was Ten Thousand
[1:36:34] Times Ten thousands and thousands of
[1:36:36] thousands saying with a loud voice
[1:36:38] Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
[1:36:43] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[1:36:46] strength and honor and glory and
[1:36:49] blessing now we've covered quite a few
[1:36:52] of them but the one that I want to take
[1:36:53] this morning is the first one after
[1:36:56] receiving power
[1:36:57] and riches amen so this morning we want
[1:37:01] to speak on riches and I titled this
[1:37:04] amen called I believe his true riches
[1:37:07] from the mount
[1:37:08] true riches from the mount praise be to
[1:37:14] God
[1:37:15] we're going to dwell on that for a
[1:37:16] little while with the help of the Lord
[1:37:18] amen may God add His blessings to the
[1:37:21] reading of the words you can be seated
[1:37:22] this morning amen I'll let you all take
[1:37:25] your chairs at your table and we'll see
[1:37:29] if the Lord won't serve you up a good
[1:37:31] meal amen
[1:37:32] praise the Lord how many come expecting
[1:37:34] let's continue to remember brother Brian
[1:37:36] I guess he's doing better sister
[1:37:37] Jeanette
[1:37:38] a man walking around more so we're just
[1:37:41] looking forward to it and so we talked
[1:37:43] to him yesterday a little bit you have a
[1:37:45] report or anything
[1:37:54] yeah okay amen but we're just
[1:37:58] amen praise the Lord so we're looking
[1:38:00] forward to him being healed amen we're
[1:38:02] getting different reports of how God is
[1:38:04] merciful to us amen but so now let's
[1:38:06] look at this for a while and riches he
[1:38:09] is worthy of riches
[1:38:11] we
[1:38:13] praise the Lord amen so we look at this
[1:38:16] and we find out that there's two kinds
[1:38:18] of riches amen first of all you know uh
[1:38:21] just that are of the world and and
[1:38:23] financial riches and so forth and uh but
[1:38:27] then their spiritual riches isn't there
[1:38:30] amen there's
[1:38:31] um what did Jesus say uh lay up not
[1:38:35] Treasures upon the Earth isn't that
[1:38:37] right they don't lay up Treasures upon
[1:38:39] the Earth where moth does corrupt and
[1:38:42] the thieves break in and steal but Jesus
[1:38:45] said lay up Treasures in Heaven where
[1:38:47] the thieves can't break in and so forth
[1:38:49] Everlasting
[1:38:51] Eternal and true riches amen amen so
[1:38:54] let's talk about these riches we realize
[1:38:55] that amen um you know of all the things
[1:38:58] and all the prosperity and all the
[1:39:00] blessings God does God bless us both The
[1:39:03] Sinner and US ain't amen I may know that
[1:39:05] sure they're all both blessed you know
[1:39:07] and so but you know just because you're
[1:39:10] blessed financially and so forth you
[1:39:12] know that's a wonderful thing but that's
[1:39:13] not why you praise God you praise God
[1:39:15] because of the spiritual riches that he
[1:39:17] brings to you amen let's turn at the
[1:39:21] same Bible if you've got it open yet I
[1:39:22] mean we don't have to go very far as we
[1:39:24] begin to look at riches amen because we
[1:39:27] truly want how many this morning would
[1:39:29] say the riches that God has and that is
[1:39:32] his we want amen you can have part of
[1:39:36] God's riches any riches you get from God
[1:39:39] it belongs to him but he wants you to be
[1:39:42] rich
[1:39:43] um I can't think of it
[1:39:45] amen but
[1:39:47] um anyway chapter three and verse 14 and
[1:39:51] unto the angel of the Church of the
[1:39:53] laodiceans right these things saith the
[1:39:56] amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:39:58] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[1:40:01] Thy works
[1:40:02] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[1:40:05] would that word cold or hot
[1:40:08] so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[1:40:14] Beauty out of my mouth
[1:40:18] amen praise the Lord how many believe
[1:40:20] that God wants you to be hot
[1:40:27] or
[1:40:34] that's quite something in it
[1:40:36] wait wait let me make sure I read that
[1:40:38] right
[1:40:39] so then because our lukewarm and neither
[1:40:42] cold nor hot
[1:40:44] I will spew thee out of my mouth
[1:40:47] amen either you're not either cold
[1:40:49] neither are you hot amen they are
[1:40:53] lukewarm
[1:40:55] so God warns us about being mediocre
[1:40:59] about your faith in God
[1:41:01] uh about being humdrum and melancholy
[1:41:07] amen
[1:41:09] he says either be hot or cold I would
[1:41:11] that word hot or cold amen
[1:41:14] there there's the word and I noticed I
[1:41:16] was looking for the word I would
[1:41:18] I didn't see it on that verse notice how
[1:41:20] I read that verse I said in verse uh
[1:41:23] um I read
[1:41:26] verse 6.
[1:41:28] 16.
[1:41:30] so then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[1:41:32] neither cold nor hot I was Beauty I was
[1:41:34] looking for the word
[1:41:35] where God wants you to be cold remember
[1:41:37] I didn't really find it but here I just
[1:41:40] now noticed and I feel like it was the
[1:41:41] Holy Spirit taking me back I know that
[1:41:44] thou art verse 15 I Know Thy works that
[1:41:48] thou art neither cold or hot
[1:41:50] I would that thou word cold
[1:41:54] or hot amen maybe I'm a little getting
[1:41:58] old but we just read it but I knew he
[1:42:00] said it but I didn't pinpoint it so
[1:42:01] there it is just right out of God's
[1:42:04] mouth I would thou word cold or hot amen
[1:42:07] either it be all for God or be against
[1:42:09] God 100 percent
[1:42:11] amen
[1:42:14] and now notice they were not cold nor
[1:42:18] hot they were lukewarm and they said
[1:42:21] about themselves verse 17 because thou
[1:42:25] sayest I am rich and increase with goods
[1:42:30] and have need of nothing
[1:42:34] amen
[1:42:36] this just comes to my mind
[1:42:38] but is it possible that when you are in
[1:42:41] a lukewarm state that you think you're
[1:42:44] okay
[1:42:47] that you're good that you got what you
[1:42:49] need
[1:42:50] you are what you want to be
[1:42:52] huh
[1:42:54] because let me tell you how many knows
[1:42:56] if you're really on fire for God you
[1:42:58] realize you're not what you want to be
[1:43:01] you want more you realize your
[1:43:03] shortcomings you realize in the areas
[1:43:05] and this is a big part of my message
[1:43:07] this morning is look at your life and
[1:43:09] look at the areas where you're still not
[1:43:11] what you ought to be because you want to
[1:43:14] be a full beneficiary of what Christ
[1:43:17] Rose for this morning
[1:43:22] isn't that the truth oh beneficiary he
[1:43:25] didn't come he didn't die on that cross
[1:43:27] he didn't take those stripes he didn't
[1:43:29] go to the depth of hell so you could be
[1:43:31] lukewarm
[1:43:36] or so that you could think that you are
[1:43:38] what you're supposed to be I don't care
[1:43:39] how long you've been the Christian you
[1:43:41] always strive for more strive for better
[1:43:46] thank you guys y'all were Amen in this
[1:43:48] morning I've got an amen corner all over
[1:43:51] the building and I like that
[1:43:53] you scare me to death when you get too
[1:43:54] quiet
[1:43:57] amen
[1:43:59] either I'm not the Holy Spirit or
[1:44:02] Through Me Maybe I'm in the way that not
[1:44:04] allowing the spirit to feed good
[1:44:07] or you're not where you ought to be one
[1:44:08] or the other isn't that right
[1:44:11] all right so this is going to be this is
[1:44:14] I really feel good about the message
[1:44:16] this morning it's good it's down to
[1:44:18] earth it's what we have need of
[1:44:20] amen
[1:44:22] and I'll I'll say it I'll say it I'll
[1:44:25] get ahead of myself would that be okay
[1:44:28] no matter how rich you get you could
[1:44:31] gain the whole world in the man
[1:44:34] but you're coming down to a place called
[1:44:37] Death
[1:44:38] and what you have at that time is the
[1:44:40] most important thing that you'll ever
[1:44:42] have
[1:44:44] that's how rich you are in God
[1:44:47] and what that riches is when you come in
[1:44:50] on that deathbed what that is is
[1:44:53] what we're going to talk about this

[1:47:44] to be a Christian and you don't have the
[1:47:46] garments of a Christian your shame
[1:47:48] appears

[1:48:13] your character your character is the
[1:48:16] only thing you're going to take with you
[1:48:19] folks when the people look at you and
[1:48:21] you look in that casket the only thing
[1:48:22] they think about not so much about how
[1:48:25] you look and how well you're addressed
[1:48:27] they think about the character that you
[1:48:29] were
[1:48:30] personality that you was
[1:48:33] the kind of character that you was I
[1:48:35] believe it's very important that you
[1:48:38] have the right character
[1:48:42] amen
[1:48:45] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:48:47] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:48:50] eyes have that thou mayest see most of
[1:48:53] the time people that are not right don't
[1:48:55] see that they're not right
[1:48:58] folks I pray the Holy Spirit go into
[1:49:01] every one of our hearts and lives this
[1:49:03] morning and show you where you are wrong
[1:49:09] I'm here to tell you as a pastor I can
[1:49:11] tell you over the pulp at a hundred
[1:49:12] thousand times
[1:49:14] but people that don't have the Holy
[1:49:16] Ghost will never see their own
[1:49:19] they refuse to see their own it takes
[1:49:22] God to prick you to show you where
[1:49:25] you're wrong at
[1:49:26] that takes a Divine Act of God
[1:49:31] amen
[1:49:33] so Lord open my eyes
[1:49:37] open my eyes to my fault
[1:49:41] because I guarantee I got 20 20 Vision
[1:49:44] on your fault
[1:49:46] you got 20 20 Vision on my fault
[1:49:49] but the backwards the three fingers that
[1:49:51] go back
[1:49:52] well it's just pretty much blind
[1:49:56] you just about don't see that you're
[1:49:57] wrong
[1:50:00] amen
[1:50:03] all right so we need the Isaiah of the
[1:50:06] Holy Spirit to show us
[1:50:08] amen
[1:50:09] because when I come down to that door of
[1:50:11] death I want my ticket in my hand huh I
[1:50:15] want everything right don't you
[1:50:21] hey man
[1:50:23] well how old was brother Ivan when he
[1:50:24] left 56 I'm already about 61 I'm
[1:50:27] thinking five years older than he was
[1:50:28] Mary Jane around that age Timmy man
[1:50:31] around that age many of them dying 55 56
[1:50:34] years old
[1:50:36] let me tell you something you get up in
[1:50:37] the age you better think about coming
[1:50:38] down to that what you got how rich you
[1:50:40] are
[1:50:42] he better not be the bank account that
[1:50:44] you're thinking about he better be your
[1:50:45] character that you're thinking about
[1:50:46] what kind of person are you
[1:50:50] I'll just go ahead and say if we spend
[1:50:52] 12 14 hours a day to try to make sure we
[1:50:54] get ahead in life
[1:50:55] we'll work and work and work but how
[1:50:57] often how much time do we spend on
[1:50:59] seeing how which we are on the inside
[1:51:01] how finally tuned we are and fellowship
[1:51:04] with almighty God
[1:51:07] how many please we need to spend more
[1:51:08] time Jesus says labor not for the meat
[1:51:10] that perishes but labor for the meat
[1:51:12] that endures unto everlasting life
[1:51:16] okay
[1:51:18] so we see here
[1:51:20] as many as I rebuke as I love I rebuke
[1:51:23] and chasten be zealous therefore and
[1:51:24] repent

[1:52:03] I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you a little
[1:52:04] story here this is this is when I
[1:52:06] thought about this riches and so forth
[1:52:08] this is the story it comes to my mind
[1:52:09] and so I I pulled it up and we just want
[1:52:14] to go slow with the help of the Lord
[1:52:15] this morning now take this image just by
[1:52:18] the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:52:20] there's a little story one time he says
[1:52:22] this is come follow me Tucson 1963.
[1:52:25] there's a little story one time I heard
[1:52:26] a man who and he was poor
[1:52:30] he was poor and he always wanted and he
[1:52:33] says it's a little fairy tale like and
[1:52:35] this morning I want to talk make it a
[1:52:37] true story
[1:52:38] would that be okay
[1:52:40] not a fairy tale but a true story we're
[1:52:42] going to make this fairy tale a true
[1:52:43] story all right and it's always stuck
[1:52:46] with me and one day he picked the flower
[1:52:49] and the plot and the flower was magic
[1:52:51] and the flower answered him and he says
[1:52:54] you've been poor all your life
[1:52:59] man
[1:53:00] and he said now I ask now ask what you
[1:53:03] will and it'll be given to you
[1:53:06] praise be to God
[1:53:08] you know Jesus said of the poor he says
[1:53:10] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[1:53:13] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:53:16] amen
[1:53:19] all right
[1:53:20] how many beliefs all of us were poor
[1:53:24] now didn't that but what Jesus said with
[1:53:28] laodicea you're poor and wretched and
[1:53:31] miserable naked but yet he said I still
[1:53:35] stand at your door no
[1:53:37] so he stands at the door of spiritually
[1:53:40] poor people
[1:53:41] poor in spirit in other words you don't
[1:53:44] you don't know which way to turn you're
[1:53:46] you know you're not you're not on top of
[1:53:48] the world you're not a Donald Trump and
[1:53:49] oh I can grab the World by the tail and
[1:53:52] so forth no you need help you need God
[1:53:55] you need to be a broken and a contrite
[1:53:57] spirit God says I love because I can
[1:54:00] work with you on that but when you're
[1:54:02] already good and you're good to go and
[1:54:04] all of that then God can't work with you
[1:54:06] God has to break you down first I will
[1:54:08] truly believe that we need a trip to The
[1:54:11] Potter's House where he can mold us and
[1:54:13] he can shape us and he take fiery
[1:54:16] furnace of Affliction and he can change
[1:54:18] us and mold us
[1:54:20] take that hammer and beat on us and beat
[1:54:23] on us
[1:54:24] until we are shaped in the image and the
[1:54:27] character that we're supposed to be
[1:54:32] amen
[1:54:34] so he says ask for you if you can watch
[1:54:36] you will now I just want to say you know
[1:54:38] that amen one day God come into my heart
[1:54:41] and he says if you'll accept me into
[1:54:43] your heart amen if you'll take me into
[1:54:46] your heart you'll be able to ask what
[1:54:48] you will
[1:54:49] and it'll be given to you I may believe
[1:54:51] that
[1:54:52] not a flower but Christ except Christ
[1:54:54] into your heart isn't that right
[1:54:57] then you can ask what you will and
[1:54:59] they'll be given to you and he says
[1:55:01] Yonder that Yonder Mountain would open
[1:55:04] up and I could go there in and find gold
[1:55:07] in that mountain
[1:55:09] and the flower says if you'll take me
[1:55:11] with you wherever you go you'll have to
[1:55:13] take me with you though remember that
[1:55:16] so wherever I am you can ask what you
[1:55:19] will and he walked up to the mountain
[1:55:20] and the mountain opened up and he went
[1:55:22] in and there were shelves that was full
[1:55:25] of gold and diamonds we will talk about
[1:55:28] that gold
[1:55:30] this morning
[1:55:31] I love how Brother Brad here some time
[1:55:33] ago talked about dying and what it makes
[1:55:36] he understands a lot better than I do
[1:55:38] but the pressure that it takes to make a
[1:55:41] diamond I mean those in order to make
[1:55:43] diamonds it takes pressure
[1:55:46] and this mountain this mountain is and I
[1:55:50] want to call up this Mount I call it
[1:55:52] Mount it's Mount Calvary
[1:55:54] how many leaves in Mount Calvary there's
[1:55:57] all kinds of gems there's gold they're

[1:56:04] of treasure on this mouth

[1:57:02] opened it up
[1:57:04] and the only thing you find is something
[1:57:06] that says five hundred thousand dollars
[1:57:08] that's if I got a thousand dollars

[2:02:25] to do what Jesus said sequence
[2:02:27] listen let's go to let's go see look at
[2:02:30] this for a minute in Matthew 25 26 and
[2:02:33] verse 25 says therefore I say unto you
[2:02:35] take no thought for your life or what
[2:02:37] you shall eat or what you shall drink or
[2:02:39] for your body what she shall put on for
[2:02:42] is not the life more than the meat and
[2:02:43] the bodied in Raymond behold the fouls
[2:02:46] of the air they so not neither do they
[2:02:48] read nor Gather in the barns yet your
[2:02:50] heavenly father feedeth them are ye not
[2:02:52] much better than they which of You by
[2:02:54] taking thought can add one cue but unto
[2:02:56] stature and why take ye thought for
[2:02:58] Raymond consider the lilies and Honeys
[2:03:01] uh grow and they tell not neither do
[2:03:04] they spin yet I say unto you that even
[2:03:06] Solomon was not a raid as one of these
[2:03:08] little ones whoever if God so clothed
[2:03:10] the grass at the field which is today
[2:03:12] and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall
[2:03:14] ye not much more clothe ye oh ye of
[2:03:17] little faith therefore take no thoughts
[2:03:19] saying well what am I gonna eat
[2:03:21] quit worrying so much about your natural
[2:03:23] things
[2:03:25] are you with me quit thinking so much
[2:03:28] about your natural things throughout
[2:03:29] these things verse 32 it says to the
[2:03:32] Gentiles seek for your heavenly father
[2:03:33] knoweth that you have need of these
[2:03:35] things but seek ye first
[2:03:39] hallelujah what am I supposed to go into
[2:03:42] this mountain look for the kingdom of
[2:03:45] God and his righteousness
[2:03:53] mountain is the righteousness of
[2:03:56] almighty God you were born in sin shape
[2:04:00] you're nothing but a sinner but you have
[2:04:03] need of God's righteousness
[2:04:09] because without God's righteousness
[2:04:12] you're not going to have any peace
[2:04:15] without his righteousness
[2:04:17] no peace
[2:04:19] and in order to be righteous
[2:04:21] you need something else in your life
[2:04:24] how many knows what that is that's
[2:04:25] forgiveness
[2:04:27] you need God's forgiveness
[2:04:30] amen
[2:04:32] I'm going to stop there we'll pull back
[2:04:34] and come back into that but I want to go
[2:04:37] to Peter
[2:04:39] look at Peter for just a minute because
[2:04:41] different three different aspects
[2:04:43] that I want to look at with the help of
[2:04:45] the Lord this morning and getting the
[2:04:47] riches of God he's worthy of all riches
[2:04:50] because you wouldn't get any of this
[2:04:51] remember this
[2:04:54] I don't care if you're a billionaire
[2:04:56] you couldn't buy one ounce of God's
[2:04:59] peace
[2:05:02] not one bit of his true Joy
[2:05:06] not one bit of his love not one bit of
[2:05:08] his grace
[2:05:09] you couldn't buy any logs offering
[2:05:11] gentleness or meekness you can't but it
[2:05:14] can't be bought with a trillion dollars
[2:05:16] but it was bought on Calvary
[2:05:19] Jesus paid for it took the dying of a
[2:05:22] man somebody had to die and that man was
[2:05:24] the lamb Jesus Christ died for the sins
[2:05:27] of the world
[2:05:28] that's why we said take Worthy is the
[2:05:31] Lamb to receive riches and glory and
[2:05:33] salvation He's Worthy
[2:05:36] that lamb that was slain he is worthy
[2:05:41] then all you got to do is accept him
[2:05:45] into your heart receive him
[2:05:47] not can't be bought had to be paid for
[2:05:50] the only way that he could come
[2:05:52] was through the blood
[2:05:54] amen
[2:05:56] now notice what was the three trials
[2:06:01] chastisement
[2:06:04] and suffering
[2:06:06] that's Heisman or correction
[2:06:09] is how do things come one place the
[2:06:11] Bible says that he was protect perfected
[2:06:13] through sufferings
[2:06:14] one place to see Brother Band said that
[2:06:17] any church that's not suffering isn't of
[2:06:19] God
[2:06:20] amen God calls us to suffer
[2:06:23] he calls us to suffer you don't get it
[2:06:25] any other way you don't get it on a
[2:06:27] flowery bed of ease
[2:06:31] how do we get this gold
[2:06:33] these riches
[2:06:35] gold
[2:06:36] diamonds
[2:06:38] amen I want to dwell on that for a
[2:06:40] little help a little bit but notice in
[2:06:42] James that our first Peter
[2:06:46] if you want to go with me
[2:06:49] First Peter 1 verse 3 blessed be to God
[2:06:53] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:06:55] which has which according to His
[2:06:57] abundant Mercy has begotten us unto a
[2:07:01] dead hope
[2:07:02] a lively hope
[2:07:05] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[2:07:08] the dead yeah we're talking on the
[2:07:09] resurrection this morning
[2:07:11] God does a livelihood because of the
[2:07:14] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[2:07:16] Glory listen to this to an inheritance
[2:07:20] incorruptible
[2:07:22] and undefiled and that faith is not away

[2:07:29] Earthly things they'll fade
[2:07:31] the rust in their fade buy a new vehicle
[2:07:33] there ain't no time that it'll be old
[2:07:36] and rusted and not everything else

[2:10:25] what to do with yourself you just gotta
[2:10:26] jump or scream or something
[2:10:30] now remember this is the joy of the Lord
[2:10:32] we should have plenty of that around
[2:10:35] when you get into actual he comes down
[2:10:37] there's sacred times that I like to just
[2:10:39] my sacred time with the Lord but there's
[2:10:41] multiple times I believe that we have
[2:10:43] where it's Joy times of joy in the Lord
[2:10:46] amen
[2:10:47] so here he says the trial of your faith
[2:10:50] is more precious than a pure precious
[2:10:53] more precious than gold that perishes
[2:10:58] your tests and your trials they come
[2:11:00] your way to try you are more precious to
[2:11:03] you than if somebody give you a suitcase
[2:11:06] of five hundred thousand dollars
[2:11:09] more precious than that
[2:11:12] why because those trials that come your
[2:11:15] way is what forms you
[2:11:19] it shapes you
[2:11:24] now notice there's something else and
[2:11:25] the second one is God's chastisement is
[2:11:28] basically God's whippings and correction
[2:11:31] to you
[2:11:32] amen
[2:11:33] those are not easy
[2:11:36] no they're not easy
[2:11:39] ah
[2:11:41] but if you can't stand chastisement if
[2:11:44] God can't corrupt you crap sometimes
[2:11:46] some and you know that that's kind of
[2:11:48] terrible but sometimes that falls on my
[2:11:50] part
[2:11:52] the pastor sometimes has to correct the
[2:11:54] church
[2:11:55] bring correction
[2:11:59] oh yeah I hate when I have to do it I
[2:12:01] like when everything's running smooth
[2:12:02] like it is amen that's all I like
[2:12:03] everything's good nobody's acting up
[2:12:07] not you know everybody's loving one
[2:12:10] another and so forth
[2:12:12] ah
[2:12:14] but sometimes he does sometimes he has
[2:12:16] to correct this and oh
[2:12:19] it just cringes and oh I know he's
[2:12:22] preaching at me he's just picking on me
[2:12:24] and you can either get an attitude about
[2:12:27] I've had people walk out and I don't
[2:12:29] even want to mention that but yeah just
[2:12:31] you know just but
[2:12:33] either take correction or you're a
[2:12:36] bastard
[2:12:37] you know I looked up to the definition
[2:12:39] of bastard children
[2:12:41] one of them that says undesirable and
[2:12:44] Despicable
[2:12:46] or a person that's born out of holy
[2:12:49] wetnock where the parents weren't uh
[2:12:52] weren't married illegitimate an
[2:12:54] illegitimate child
[2:12:56] in other words you claim to be a
[2:12:58] Christian but you're not really
[2:13:00] you're not a God doesn't have bastard
[2:13:03] children
[2:13:04] no you're either son or a bastard amen
[2:13:06] so we don't want to be bastards we want
[2:13:08] to take the correction that God gives us
[2:13:11] amen
[2:13:13] but trials as I was saying God loves to
[2:13:17] dig for gold he looks tries to look for
[2:13:19] gold in your life how does he look for
[2:13:22] gold in your life the same way he did
[2:13:24] with Israel
[2:13:25] when he took the two million people out
[2:13:27] of Egypt brought them all out oh the
[2:13:30] Miriam and everybody was dancing they
[2:13:33] were shopping when they left Egypt isn't
[2:13:36] that right just great joy great shouts
[2:13:39] and a wonderful service
[2:13:42] then right after the service Monday came
[2:13:44] along
[2:13:45] they come down to a red sea and boy
[2:13:47] everything that could go wrong did go
[2:13:49] wrong
[2:13:50] is that right they come up against us
[2:13:52] see and I can just imagine now through
[2:13:55] these cliffs in this pathway through
[2:13:57] there and at the bottom of it they come
[2:13:59] to the bottom of it way down there
[2:14:01] somewhere and there's the water big old
[2:14:04] body water they can't even cross they
[2:14:06] ain't got no boats
[2:14:08] all the families the children the horses
[2:14:10] the wagons whatever they can't cross it
[2:14:12] and boy you talk about people really
[2:14:14] questioning their leader
[2:14:17] you know that's a good time whenever the
[2:14:19] church begin to question their leaders
[2:14:21] when really hard times hit the church
[2:14:24] rough well if he was of God he was if
[2:14:27] you just watch your mouth that's exactly
[2:14:29] what the Israelites I said who are you
[2:14:31] why did you bring us out here to die
[2:14:33] amen
[2:14:35] Moses didn't like it either I don't like
[2:14:37] it either but God brings us to those
[2:14:39] places
[2:14:41] amen he brings you to those
[2:14:44] uncomfortable places in your life
[2:14:49] and I got some really bad news
[2:14:52] according to the Bible and the prophet
[2:14:55] of God he says every son that cometh
[2:14:57] must be tried everybody gets to have to
[2:15:00] take that test
[2:15:02] everybody has to go through it
[2:15:05] Amen brother Danny I'll give him a heads
[2:15:07] up because he says I'm a young preacher
[2:15:09] and I know I got to go trials you better
[2:15:10] keep your head up buddy it'll come in
[2:15:13] the way you don't expect to from a
[2:15:15] person you would never expected
[2:15:19] you never know when you're going through
[2:15:21] it you just think oh this is just this
[2:15:23] is just this is just a success but you
[2:15:25] got to realize hey God give it in God's
[2:15:27] hands
[2:15:29] because let me tell you God has a unique
[2:15:31] way to try us it's not like a lot of
[2:15:34] times he's going to allow you to say
[2:15:35] well I I got this figured out
[2:15:37] no you ain't got it figured out you'll
[2:15:40] try to straighten it up and go through
[2:15:41] it and yourself and this out of the
[2:15:43] other huh
[2:15:47] can I give you a personal testimony
[2:15:50] you're talking to a man that has come
[2:15:52] that to that place that is tried tried
[2:15:55] and tried and that had many failures
[2:15:58] amen many times I've failed
[2:16:01] amen
[2:16:02] but eventually I learned that where I go
[2:16:05] about that is right here this is where I
[2:16:08] go when those come and learn to give it
[2:16:11] to God instead of letting it come in
[2:16:13] here
[2:16:14] amen
[2:16:17] that's right but I've learned it
[2:16:20] amen just because you don't pass it the
[2:16:21] first time second time third time 20th
[2:16:23] time don't mean you're not a child of
[2:16:24] God if you're his you'll pass it
[2:16:27] eventually
[2:16:29] can I tell you some good news if you're
[2:16:32] a child of God there's no time there's
[2:16:33] no limit on how many times you'll get
[2:16:35] this test
[2:16:36] he was gonna he's gonna give you test
[2:16:38] many times as you need it until you pass
[2:16:40] it
[2:16:42] amen Hard Times rough times
[2:16:46] things that you should think my this
[2:16:48] just couldn't be shouldn't be
[2:16:51] huh
[2:16:53] amen
[2:16:57] praise the Lord Brother Danny uh
[2:16:59] something else talk about you know
[2:17:00] you've seen we're stepping into walking
[2:17:03] in the steps of Jesus yeah I've been to
[2:17:05] I see that when you want to walk and you
[2:17:07] want to follow his steps and you're like
[2:17:09] wow do I do gotta do that how about how
[2:17:11] about getting scars from the house of
[2:17:13] your friends
[2:17:15] or being crucified and whatnot else by
[2:17:18] your own children and so forth
[2:17:20] but yes you got to be able to walk
[2:17:22] wherever Jesus goes in whatever it costs
[2:17:25] but we're following Christ amen
[2:17:28] just hope God helps you through all of
[2:17:30] those times but it's the molding times
[2:17:32] it's the hard times it means that mold
[2:17:35] you and shape you and make give you
[2:17:37] character or
[2:17:39] drive you crazy
[2:17:41] yeah and you won't be sitting in the
[2:17:43] views no more you'll be on
[2:17:46] that's right because if your son of God
[2:17:48] it's going to come
[2:17:50] amen
[2:17:53] and now I just want to say something you
[2:17:57] know from down the road but if you don't
[2:17:59] end up overcoming you're not a child of
[2:18:02] God
[2:18:03] because the Bible promised that thy seed
[2:18:05] shall possess the gates of the enemy
[2:18:08] if you're a child of God you will
[2:18:10] possess the gates of everything the
[2:18:11] devil throws at you
[2:18:13] God will see to it in you
[2:18:15] that it happens
[2:18:18] I'm a witness amen he'll get you through
[2:18:21] it
[2:18:23] amen praise the Lord how many believes
[2:18:26] it was trials and those tests it's what
[2:18:27] molds and shapes you now I want to say
[2:18:30] this a lot of us have already went
[2:18:31] through those things and it shaped us
[2:18:33] it's formed us
[2:18:35] amen
[2:18:40] I still have tests I still have trials
[2:18:43] but not like I did have
[2:18:45] amen
[2:18:47] the Lord knows
[2:18:48] that if he puts it on to me again he
[2:18:51] already knows what I'm gonna do
[2:18:53] I'll go down on my knee and I'll commit
[2:18:55] it to God
[2:18:56] amen if you thought I didn't he'd
[2:18:58] probably do it again
[2:19:00] amen
[2:19:01] everybody understands that
[2:19:04] now to another story
[2:19:07] y'all have heard of the creeper y'all
[2:19:10] have heard of what brother bam said and
[2:19:11] I'll just read it now notice
[2:19:16] some years ago on patrol going through a
[2:19:19] cornfield I would think of a a limb that
[2:19:22] had I was thinking and I seen that there
[2:19:24] at a limb that had blowed off of a tree
[2:19:25] and it fell over a stalk of corn and
[2:19:28] that stalk was trying its best to get
[2:19:30] straight like it was supposed to be but
[2:19:33] it was deformed because there's
[2:19:34] something that had happened that stick
[2:19:37] was laying over it another cases
[2:19:39] whenever uh he says also we find the
[2:19:42] creeper in the field many of you men and
[2:19:43] women with a in Kentucky with the hose
[2:19:45] and so forth you'd have to them little
[2:19:47] creepers that creep up on them and
[2:19:49] manage deforms and all kinds of things
[2:19:51] he says now if you didn't get those
[2:19:53] Creepers out there with the corn was in
[2:19:55] the row like this then that creeper
[2:19:57] would reach over and grab a hold of the
[2:19:58] Corn wrap itself around gradually so
[2:20:01] easily it's Lively and that you would
[2:20:03] hardly could tell that it was rapping
[2:20:04] and finally it cooked stronger and
[2:20:06] stronger and it pulls at corn till it's
[2:20:09] deformed pulls it against itself wraps
[2:20:12] around its own Vine deforming it from
[2:20:14] what it was to something else amen Amino
[2:20:20] is When Trials and tests and suffering
[2:20:22] and this that and the other comes
[2:20:24] sometimes I mean if you allow those
[2:20:25] trials and testimony to come lean on you
[2:20:27] amen as a Christian man and you don't
[2:20:30] get those things that creep in your life
[2:20:31] and cause you amen perhaps bitterness
[2:20:35] ah suffering because somebody did you
[2:20:38] wrong or whatever it is
[2:20:41] huh
[2:20:43] you let that stay there and remember
[2:20:45] that bitterness it'll cause you to
[2:20:46] become deformed you'll and I thought you
[2:20:49] know it'll never grow any higher
[2:20:52] if there's something comes into changes
[2:20:54] you the only way you'll grow is sideways
[2:20:56] or down you'll never grow you'll never
[2:20:59] get any deeper in God
[2:21:00] if you like something like trials and
[2:21:02] tests to come your way
[2:21:04] and not to get the better to get victory
[2:21:07] over it
[2:21:08] one other thing the next thing that I
[2:21:10] want to bring out amen now uh and that
[2:21:13] is Grace or forgiveness
[2:21:17] how many knows that if you're ever going
[2:21:19] to have the very righteousness of God
[2:21:21] Amen you need the Forgiveness of God
[2:21:24] has to forgive you
[2:21:29] unforgiveness will absolutely if you're
[2:21:32] not forgiving and you've got sin in your
[2:21:33] life
[2:21:35] you are gonna be sad
[2:21:38] depressed knowing you're not right
[2:21:42] it's going to lay there
[2:21:44] but when you go on your knees and you
[2:21:46] ask God to forgive you and how many
[2:21:49] knows God is very gracious to forgive
[2:21:51] you
[2:21:52] I don't care if you've done that uh if
[2:21:54] you owe him a hundred thousand dollars
[2:21:56] so to speak remember the one old a
[2:21:57] hundred thousand the other one just a
[2:21:59] little you've been forgiven a much God
[2:22:01] will forgive you of much the woman that
[2:22:03] was caught in the very active adultery
[2:22:05] God forgive you neither do I can never
[2:22:07] condemn thee go and sin no more
[2:22:11] amen
[2:22:12] I'm thankful for that what a jewel
[2:22:16] amen what a gym
[2:22:20] what a wonderful God that he forgives us
[2:22:23] you'd be gone folks I believe it was a
[2:22:27] song called a gospel song history he
[2:22:29] says what if God held it against you
[2:22:31] you'd be in trouble wouldn't you
[2:22:35] turn with me to Matthew 6.
[2:22:42] Matthew 6.
[2:22:52] and verse 7.
[2:22:55] Matthew 6 and verse 7.
[2:22:58] but when ye pray use not vain
[2:23:00] repetitions as the Heathen do for they
[2:23:02] think that in much they shall be heard
[2:23:04] in for their much speaking
[2:23:09] but be not ye therefore like unto them
[2:23:11] for your father knoweth what things you
[2:23:14] need have need of before you even ask
[2:23:17] after this manner therefore pray ye Our
[2:23:20] Father which art in Heaven halloweth be
[2:23:22] thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[2:23:25] done on Earth as it is in heaven give us
[2:23:28] this day our daily bread and forgive us
[2:23:30] of our debts as we forgive our debtors
[2:23:31] amen look at that that's what I want to
[2:23:33] get to forgive us of our debts
[2:23:37] what a great treasure
[2:23:39] because how many knows that with the
[2:23:41] Forgiveness of your sins comes
[2:23:43] reconciliation
[2:23:45] the great Jewel the great Jewel of
[2:23:48] reconciliation being reconciled back to
[2:23:51] almighty God I mean one of the great
[2:23:53] things that I want to go into this
[2:23:54] mountain for I mean is to get fellowship
[2:23:56] with my heavenly Father Again
[2:23:59] being reconciled to God to have
[2:24:01] fellowship with again that's truly my
[2:24:03] and then this story I didn't finish the
[2:24:05] story I'll go ahead and finish it all
[2:24:06] you'll be asking me after service but
[2:24:08] after the it says that this man he says
[2:24:10] I gotta go tell my friends I gotta go
[2:24:12] tell my friends I'm rich I'm rich I'm
[2:24:14] rich hahaha
[2:24:16] I thought that's why the real believer
[2:24:18] does you got to tell everybody do you
[2:24:20] know Christ do you know Christ I'm rich
[2:24:22] let the poor say I am strong or Rich let
[2:24:25] the weak say I am strong
[2:24:28] Let The Sinner say I'm a saint let that
[2:24:30] sick say I'm Healed
[2:24:32] let the weak say I'm strong that's real
[2:24:36] jewels
[2:24:37] gotta go down gotta go tell but he left
[2:24:40] the flower he says I shut up the flower
[2:24:42] kept telling you got to take me with you
[2:24:44] gotta take me with you and he said I
[2:24:45] shut up I gotta go do this it's so busy
[2:24:47] with the treasures that he had
[2:24:49] he forgotten left him on a shelf folks
[2:24:51] let me just conclude with this as far as
[2:24:53] that story is don't leave him on
[2:24:56] yourself because you don't get so busy
[2:24:57] with this world stuff that you leave him
[2:25:00] on the Shelf somewhere
[2:25:04] don't get so busy with the things of
[2:25:06] this world
[2:25:08] trying to get happiness
[2:25:10] and riches that you don't get the true
[2:25:13] Riches of Joy folks if there's anything
[2:25:14] that you ought to look for
[2:25:17] it's Joy I believe Paul said the Kingdom
[2:25:19] of Heaven is not meat and drink but it's
[2:25:21] righteousness peace and joy in the Holy
[2:25:25] Ghost that's the kingdom of heaven
[2:25:27] righteousness
[2:25:29] peace and joy
[2:25:32] in Christ
[2:25:35] you know I'm glad that man left him in
[2:25:37] that mountain he left him on the shelf
[2:25:38] and the Mountain closed out that was the
[2:25:40] end now he didn't get no more but you
[2:25:42] and I don't have to do that why because
[2:25:43] how many believe will you take him with
[2:25:45] us
[2:25:46] wherever we go and whatever we ever have
[2:25:49] native
[2:25:50] everything in that mountain that
[2:25:51] everything that he could ever dream of
[2:25:55] when you get the Holy Ghost you have
[2:25:56] everything that you'll ever need in this
[2:25:58] life Journey Amen in death in the
[2:26:00] resurrection and in the world to come
[2:26:01] you got everything that you have need of
[2:26:03] just don't leave him
[2:26:07] I'm not leaving him are you leaving him
[2:26:08] no not leaving him on the Shelf
[2:26:10] somewhere not putting him second in our
[2:26:12] life he stays first
[2:26:15] and then you can ask what you will he
[2:26:17] will supply every need that you have
[2:26:22] let's go a little deeper
[2:26:24] forgive us of our best
[2:26:26] as we forgive our debtors lead us not
[2:26:27] into temptation but to Deliver Us from
[2:26:29] Evil
[2:26:30] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[2:26:32] and the glory forever amen
[2:26:34] oh you thought that was then no Jesus
[2:26:36] says a little more because new we need a
[2:26:39] little more
[2:26:40] are you with me
[2:26:41] after that
[2:26:43] for if you forgive men there trespasses
[2:26:46] wow
[2:26:48] how many beliefs this is the law of God
[2:26:50] this is God's law
[2:26:54] if you forgive men that trespasses
[2:26:56] you're heavenly father will also forgive
[2:26:58] you
[2:27:00] so if you want forgiveness forgive
[2:27:03] you want your sins retained don't
[2:27:06] forgive
[2:27:08] don't forgive those that do you wrong
[2:27:13] and then God won't forgive you
[2:27:17] how many knows when you don't do that
[2:27:19] you're going to live in a world of
[2:27:22] misery
[2:27:24] Satan will straddle your shoulders and
[2:27:26] he'll guide you and he'll make you do
[2:27:28] this and that and the other he'll
[2:27:29] torment you your comfort in bed is going
[2:27:32] to be bitterness
[2:27:34] hatred and variance
[2:27:37] because you don't forgive
[2:27:40] folks I have seen I have seen marriages
[2:27:43] where there was unfaithfulness
[2:27:48] unfaithfulness
[2:27:50] and there was an attempt made
[2:27:52] an attempt made for forgiveness
[2:27:56] but
[2:27:57] it just didn't seem to happen
[2:27:59] that marriage didn't last
[2:28:02] amen seen it fall apart
[2:28:04] there has to be genuine
[2:28:07] forgiveness

[2:28:19] it'll separate you from your friends
[2:28:23] amen
[2:28:25] it's almost it's the Cesspool Satan
[2:28:29] unforgiveness is the Cesspool of Satan

[2:29:02] nothing up
[2:29:04] but don't want to talk about don't even
[2:29:06] don't even talk to me about it
[2:29:09] because if I can't forgive I won't be
[2:29:12] free I'll be a miserable creature
[2:29:14] I refuse to be miserable
[2:29:17] amen
[2:29:19] aren't you glad to be able to forgive it
[2:29:22] is a absolute Jewel for you to have the
[2:29:25] ability to forgive
[2:29:28] and here we're we're a church we're a
[2:29:30] group I guarantee you we're going to do
[2:29:32] each other wrong
[2:29:34] we're going to say something that
[2:29:35] somebody didn't like or you didn't like
[2:29:37] this that or the other
[2:29:39] and you can let it ease at you
[2:29:42] or you can say I forgive him
[2:29:44] I didn't even think nothing of it
[2:29:47] you remember brother Brandon one time
[2:29:48] where it was going to take him let me
[2:29:49] tell you it leads to destruction
[2:29:51] it leads to destruction unforgiveness
[2:29:54] leads to destruction of you your family
[2:29:56] it brings these it makes you deformed it
[2:30:00] deforms you
[2:30:01] keeps you from being a Christian and you
[2:30:03] can't grow you won't grow in the Lord
[2:30:06] wherever you held that bitterness that's
[2:30:08] where you stay right there you won't go
[2:30:10] any further until that is taken care of
[2:30:12] remember Jesus even said you know if you
[2:30:14] got all against your neighbor brother he
[2:30:16] says lay your altar out you leave your
[2:30:18] gift at the altar and go make that right
[2:30:19] I'm not accepting your gift until you
[2:30:22] make that right
[2:30:24] amen
[2:30:25] God doesn't allow you to prosper and
[2:30:27] grow until you first forgive
[2:30:30] that's so many times you say like
[2:30:32] brother Dan says a lot of times you know
[2:30:34] a lot of times our Scars come from the
[2:30:36] house of our friends
[2:30:38] our very best friends sometimes
[2:30:41] I as a pastor have caused scars
[2:30:45] but I try to make it right
[2:30:48] I try to get right I'm willing to repent
[2:30:50] anybody has any scars from kind of me
[2:30:52] I'm open
[2:30:53] I'll ask you to forgive me I don't have
[2:30:55] anything wrong
[2:30:57] amen
[2:30:58] forgive me I thought this Jim of being
[2:31:00] able to forgive and then you can live in
[2:31:02] peace say wow this is a great place to
[2:31:04] live
[2:31:05] I certainly wouldn't want to live in the
[2:31:07] other world it's a world of Torment
[2:31:11] amen
[2:31:13] for if you forgive man their trespasses
[2:31:15] your heavenly also will forgive you but
[2:31:16] if you forgive not men there trespasses
[2:31:18] neither will you that also means that
[2:31:21] you've got all of your sins on you
[2:31:25] how many knows that
[2:31:26] and then not only that it says the shame
[2:31:28] of thy nakedness do not appear amen
[2:31:31] whenever you have that it everybody can
[2:31:34] see it
[2:31:39] amen
[2:31:41] I wouldn't want brother Brad up here
[2:31:43] Danny up and I you wouldn't want me up
[2:31:45] here
[2:31:49] if I had had something against you
[2:31:52] or bitterness
[2:31:54] amen
[2:31:55] or Unforgiven you wouldn't want me up
[2:31:57] here
[2:31:58] you see you don't want to hear that
[2:32:00] amen
[2:32:03] so thank God
[2:32:05] thank God that we forgive one another
[2:32:08] even as Christ has forgiven you
[2:32:11] somebody that does something wrong to
[2:32:13] you forgive him
[2:32:15] amen
[2:32:17] because why
[2:32:19] one of the great Treasures that Christ
[2:32:21] came was to give you victory
[2:32:25] well I just can't I just can't I just
[2:32:27] can't you better go the only thing that
[2:32:29] I can conclude if you cannot ever
[2:32:30] forgive is I question your birth
[2:32:33] I question your new birth
[2:32:38] amen
[2:32:40] now I say that not lightly but I'm going
[2:32:43] to take you back into the context of
[2:32:44] what the prophet taught us he says when
[2:32:46] there's a squabble and the qualm comes
[2:32:48] up in church and you just stay out of
[2:32:50] church
[2:32:51] says I question your experience
[2:32:55] he questioned your experience just
[2:32:57] because you go out of church because of
[2:32:59] a squabble or something that's going on
[2:33:01] and if you can't ever overcome things
[2:33:04] that people have done for you I question
[2:33:05] your experience
[2:33:08] amen
[2:33:10] this is okay this is a little pastor
[2:33:12] this morning but we need it
[2:33:14] I need it we all need it
[2:33:18] because when we're playing volleyball
[2:33:20] and I step on your foot I'm gonna say
[2:33:22] I'm sorry brother I'm sorry sister
[2:33:24] that's just a small example of living
[2:33:26] together having to put up with us humans
[2:33:29] back of my story about the brand I'm hot
[2:33:31] it nearly destroyed his life
[2:33:33] unforgiveness almost destroyed brother
[2:33:35] Madam's life remember people would not
[2:33:37] listen to what he was saying it would
[2:33:39] not believe the sign that Christ was
[2:33:41] doing and he was finally done with
[2:33:43] people didn't he say later he was
[2:33:45] finished he was so tore up people have
[2:33:47] just so rejected him until he says I'm
[2:33:49] just going to go out in the mountain and
[2:33:50] when God has something for me I'll come
[2:33:52] in and I'll tell it then I'll go right
[2:33:53] back out remember where the vision
[2:33:55] finally left him he says he's seen he's
[2:33:57] seen a couple of his friends at some
[2:33:58] city dump in the vision
[2:34:00] and there they were around some bum fire
[2:34:03] and there he was with him he says you'll
[2:34:06] end up like them
[2:34:07] if you go down the road did you go on
[2:34:10] and brother Branham had to go off the
[2:34:11] field for a little bit and come back and
[2:34:12] says I need to get my feeling back I
[2:34:14] need to get my heart right
[2:34:15] so that I could have the feeling of the
[2:34:17] people anymore
[2:34:18] because we as human beings we are so
[2:34:21] full of mistakes
[2:34:23] so full of a fault amen that we need
[2:34:26] more of God we need more of his Spirit
[2:34:29] we need more of his character I want his
[2:34:31] character don't you his character that's
[2:34:34] molded by those things now remember this
[2:34:36] those hard things that come our way
[2:34:37] those things you say well that just
[2:34:40] happened no no no it didn't just happen
[2:34:42] God allowed those things to happen to
[2:34:45] see how you would react how you would
[2:34:48] act
[2:34:49] amen
[2:34:51] which side you would take
[2:34:53] and you can either have Christ's
[2:34:55] character he says well
[2:34:57] they even crucified him
[2:34:59] many places even as Christ suffered amen
[2:35:03] sometimes we he suffered because of our
[2:35:05] sin
[2:35:07] didn't he said forgive them and that's
[2:35:10] what we do to each other look it might
[2:35:11] be your sin it might be that we the
[2:35:13] fault of each other we suffer for our
[2:35:15] each other but he said forgive him
[2:35:18] we arm yourselves the Bible says I think
[2:35:21] I think in James with the same mind that
[2:35:23] Christ had
[2:35:25] even as Christ has forgiven you forgive
[2:35:27] others also amen praise the Lord
[2:35:31] amen
[2:35:33] because that's what makes
[2:35:35] well you say well I got perfect love I I
[2:35:38] want the perfect I want that gym without
[2:35:40] perfect love you're not going to be
[2:35:42] there are you how are we ever going to
[2:35:44] know if you have very glove or not
[2:35:47] riverbam says you know what we allowed
[2:35:49] to Pat the man on the back the Pat's our
[2:35:51] back
[2:35:52] but he says you know if you let a man
[2:35:53] slap you in the face and see if you want
[2:35:55] to still Pat him on the back or not
[2:35:57] he says yeah try it find out let's find
[2:36:00] out whether you got this real gem that
[2:36:02] it's going to be take to get you there
[2:36:03] amen
[2:36:05] don't just pray for those that pray for
[2:36:06] you pray for those that despitefully use
[2:36:08] you persecute you no matter what you do
[2:36:10] a lot of times uh let me just finalize
[2:36:13] let me finish it with this can I
[2:36:15] with what how Peter put it I like how
[2:36:17] Peter put it
[2:36:19] he says for this is thankworthy if a man
[2:36:22] for conscience sake
[2:36:26] Freeman
[2:36:27] for this is thankworthy if a man for
[2:36:30] conscience Towers God endure grief
[2:36:35] oh I'm so grieved I just so agree yeah
[2:36:38] endure grief
[2:36:40] suffering wrongfully
[2:36:45] for what glory is it when ye are
[2:36:47] buffeted for your faults you shall take
[2:36:49] it patiently how many believe anytime I
[2:36:51] do something wrong and I know that's my
[2:36:53] fault I take it patiently that's right
[2:36:55] that's exactly right
[2:36:57] but
[2:36:58] but when you do well and suffer for it
[2:37:01] and you take it picantly this is
[2:37:04] acceptable to God
[2:37:09] wow when you suffer wrongfully and you
[2:37:13] take it
[2:37:15] and you don't have no bitterness
[2:37:17] you keep your composure
[2:37:19] you don't get that thing in your heart
[2:37:21] but if you get that thing in your heart
[2:37:23] don't act
[2:37:24] it's in there get it out right
[2:37:27] don't act but if in the heart it's you
[2:37:29] know for even here unto where ye called
[2:37:34] you know in the future the false mind
[2:37:37] and the world and what they're going to
[2:37:39] do to us ain't no telling what we're
[2:37:40] going to have to go through yet
[2:37:43] you know in the world order how that
[2:37:46] right is wrong and anything said anybody
[2:37:49] says they Twisted Plumb the other way
[2:37:50] you could say one thing and they'll say
[2:37:52] that you said the other
[2:37:55] I was looking at the news and and uh Fox
[2:37:59] News or one of them said that uh Melania
[2:38:02] Trump that's his wife is standing by
[2:38:05] Trump on this and then I read down here
[2:38:06] on this corner he says Melania Trump is
[2:38:09] not standing with her husband
[2:38:11] I'm like well well
[2:38:15] says she does one says you don't
[2:38:18] they kind of twist it around you know
[2:38:19] and that's what people do to you A lot
[2:38:21] of times you say something you do
[2:38:23] something twisted around and you have to
[2:38:25] get used to because how many knows Jesus
[2:38:28] suffered wrong he didn't
[2:38:30] I read in the Bible where it says
[2:38:32] remember where Jesus said he says who's
[2:38:34] who's coined what inscription is it on
[2:38:37] Caesars should we pay taxes he says yeah
[2:38:40] she says it sees us in scriptures give
[2:38:43] unto Caesar the things that are seized
[2:38:44] ran to God towards God later in the
[2:38:47] Bible you'll find that those Pharisees
[2:38:49] when the Judgment came to be they said
[2:38:51] that he's even saying that we shouldn't
[2:38:53] pay our taxes
[2:38:54] straight up lied about what he said
[2:38:59] they'll do it to you
[2:39:01] straight up lie
[2:39:04] and then remember brother when he was
[2:39:06] here there was a man that lied or tried
[2:39:09] to steal his tent or something
[2:39:10] and he says brother why don't you preach
[2:39:12] for me tonight
[2:39:14] I I've got a congregation I believe
[2:39:17] you'd have a little problem but yeah
[2:39:18] that's the kind of process you must
[2:39:19] preach for me you know offer him good do
[2:39:21] good to them that despitefully use you
[2:39:23] and so forth
[2:39:24] amen
[2:39:25] Lord Jesus I don't know about you but I
[2:39:27] want when I come to that place
[2:39:29] when the Rapture comes
[2:39:33] I want that character I want a
[2:39:35] christ-like character
[2:39:38] that has been molded by the fiery
[2:39:41] furnace of affliction
[2:39:42] are you with me this morning
[2:39:45] you better come brother bam says before
[2:39:47] it's too late saith the Lord and by of
[2:39:49] me gold
[2:39:52] God's very own life isn't that what that
[2:39:55] goal is
[2:39:56] that gold is God's very life
[2:39:59] that's tried in the fire and you will be
[2:40:02] truly rich
[2:40:04] amen are you getting it listen naked
[2:40:07] physically we came into this world but
[2:40:09] naked spiritually you will not leave it
[2:40:11] no we're going to take something with us
[2:40:14] and what that something is is all that
[2:40:18] we can take with us
[2:40:21] amen nothing less and nothing more
[2:40:26] so we had better be real careful now to
[2:40:29] see what we take with us that we take
[2:40:32] something that will make us right before
[2:40:34] God so then what will it what will we
[2:40:37] take with us we will take our character
[2:40:43] boy wasn't he a character
[2:40:45] no let them say boy wasn't he a
[2:40:48] Christian
[2:40:48] now that man that woman they were
[2:40:50] genuine Christian that brother was a
[2:40:53] Christian when they look at you let them
[2:40:55] say she was a Christian he was a
[2:40:57] Christian
[2:41:00] amen you love the Lord stand with me
[2:41:10] now what kind of character will you take
[2:41:12] with you will it be his whose character
[2:41:15] was molded by sufferings in a fiery
[2:41:18] furnace of Affliction or will it be the
[2:41:21] softness of this characterless laodicea
[2:41:23] people it's up to each one of us for in
[2:41:26] that day
[2:41:27] you'll bear your own burden how many
[2:41:29] believe that when that day comes
[2:41:31] nobody's going to be able to change you
[2:41:33] or help you
[2:41:35] it'll be what you have done
[2:41:37] yourself in life with our heads bowed
[2:41:43] different place I said I read where
[2:41:45] prophet of God said you know usually on
[2:41:47] Easter people will spend thousands and
[2:41:49] millions of dollars
[2:41:50] to put Easter flowers on the altar he
[2:41:53] says the altar is not made for Easter
[2:41:55] flowers the altar is made for you God
[2:41:59] wants humans he wants your heart
[2:42:02] he wants your life that's what we can
[2:42:05] give to Christ this morning
[2:42:07] how many of you are in here this morning
[2:42:09] with your heads bowed eyes closed I want
[2:42:12] you to think about the area in your life
[2:42:15] where you need to have more of Christ's
[2:42:17] character where you can still change and
[2:42:20] say God I need to change in this area of
[2:42:23] my life think about it
[2:42:25] if you don't know then you need to go to
[2:42:28] thinking because I'll raise my hands and
[2:42:29] says I know the things that I want to
[2:42:31] change I see where I need to change my
[2:42:33] character still when I need to let the
[2:42:35] Holy Spirit change it think about in
[2:42:37] your life what are you still doing what
[2:42:39] is it still where you need to change it
[2:42:41] do you have something raise it to him
[2:42:43] and say God
[2:42:44] I'm just still needing to change
[2:42:47] I'm still needing more of your character
[2:42:49] hands up all over the building God bless
[2:42:52] you God bless you I got mine up we're
[2:42:54] going to raise it all to Christ now Lord
[2:42:56] Jesus we come before you this morning
[2:42:58] Lord and we realize God that one of
[2:43:00] these days
[2:43:02] all Earthly Treasures will vanish your
[2:43:04] way
[2:43:06] Lord but there's only one treasure that
[2:43:08] we could take with us and that is our
[2:43:10] fellowship our relationship with you the
[2:43:14] character that has that we have the kind
[2:43:16] of persons that we have become because
[2:43:19] of the things that we have suffered in
[2:43:22] life that we have went through the kind
[2:43:24] of person that we have become is the
[2:43:26] only thing that we can take with us Lord
[2:43:28] and we ask God that we will be full of
[2:43:31] Faith Full Of Love full of patience full
[2:43:34] of long-suffering full of gentleness and
[2:43:37] meekness and love most of all one for
