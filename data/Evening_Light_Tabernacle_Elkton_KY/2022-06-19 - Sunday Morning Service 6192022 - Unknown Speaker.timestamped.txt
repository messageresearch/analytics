[0:56] happy father's day father's day to all
[0:58] the fathers
[1:00] it's a privilege and an honor to be in
[1:02] our father's house this morning and what
[1:04] a wonderful day he's given us a
[1:07] wonderful weather
[1:09] we know that where two or three gathered
[1:11] he promised that he'd be in our midst
[1:14] so whatever we have need of this morning
[1:17] i hope everybody came expecting
[1:19] psalms 103
[1:22] and we're going to start in verse 10 and
[1:24] we're just going to read the verse out
[1:26] there
[1:28] psalms 103 verses starting at verse 10.
[1:31] he hath not dealt with us after our sins
[1:34] nor rewarded us according to our
[1:36] iniquities
[1:44] as far as the east is from the west so
[1:46] far hath he removed our transgressions
[1:48] from us
[1:56] where he knoweth our frame he remembered
[1:58] that we are dust
[2:06] where the wind passes over it and it is
[2:09] gone and the place thereof shall know it
[2:11] no more
[2:22] as keep his covenant and to those that
[2:24] remember his commandments to do them
[2:33] bless the lord ye his angels that excel
[2:36] in strength that do his commandments
[2:38] hearkening unto the voice of his word
[2:47] this one together bless the lord always
[2:50] works in all places of his dominion
[2:53] bless the lord o my soul
[2:55] god bless you may be seated brother
[2:57] brian
[3:11] good morning brothers and sisters if you
[3:12] would turn with me to
[3:15] deuteronomy the third chapter
[3:18] i don't know if i've mentioned this
[3:19] before but
[3:22] before i get started the uh
[3:25] we're down to about 71 000 on the on the
[3:29] general fund
[3:31] i don't know if i mentioned it the first
[3:33] week
[3:34] you know confession is good for the soul
[3:38] as you know when it gets hot like this i
[3:40] tend to get a little more busier
[3:42] and i'll just be honest there's twice
[3:44] this week that i've lost my
[3:47] i have an advantage in my business
[3:49] most of the time if i'm on a roof or in
[3:51] a rack room where there's no one around
[3:53] so if you get angry
[3:55] or you get mad no one hears you so you
[3:58] just have to accept the fact that you
[3:59] just we're out of place and there's been
[4:01] twice this week you know we all can lose
[4:04] our composure sometimes where
[4:07] you it's kind of funny when you're
[4:10] yelling at a thousand pieces thousand
[4:12] pound piece of steel for no reason you
[4:14] know that things have gone too far you
[4:17] know what i mean
[4:18] you need to separate you need to step
[4:20] back and think twice
[4:22] and uh and yesterday it was the same the
[4:24] second time and
[4:26] when you spent an hour standing on a
[4:28] ladder working i won't i was about to
[4:31] say i won't say it
[4:32] and then uh you realize
[4:35] that piece of equipment you know you've
[4:36] gone too far
[4:38] so
[4:38] you know we all get to a place in life
[4:40] where you know we have to realize we're
[4:42] not perfect
[4:44] but we do have a god that is perfect and
[4:46] if we cast our cares upon him and we all
[4:49] week you know sometimes we we forget the
[4:52] liberties we have as christians this
[4:54] morning you know you have the right to
[4:55] be happy this morning you have the right
[4:58] through the word of god
[5:00] and prayer and believing to be happy in
[5:03] the word of god and to be happy in the
[5:05] world every living this morning you
[5:06] don't have to be depressed you don't
[5:08] have to be angry you don't have to be
[5:10] none of that you got everything you need
[5:12] in the message of the hour and the word
[5:14] of god to be happy now does your enemy
[5:16] try to steal your happiness and try to
[5:18] steal your
[5:20] purpose you just have you know i've
[5:22] realized in life was the old post back
[5:24] to that
[5:25] psalm we were
[5:26] reading where it talks about we flourish
[5:29] like the flower
[5:30] and there's a lot of truth you know
[5:31] flower starts as a small thing just like
[5:34] we all do and at the end
[5:35] depending on the type of flowers it can
[5:37] be anything from a small
[5:39] plant to a large plant stove but
[5:41] eventually it's going to go back in the
[5:43] ground one day and before you realize it
[5:45] it's all over and the only thing that
[5:47] matters are you reflecting what god made
[5:50] you to be for this age that you're
[5:52] living in that i don't know what that is
[5:55] only you and god know what he wants you
[5:57] to flourish and want
[5:58] you to represent to the world that we're
[6:00] around this morning
[6:02] you know
[6:03] and
[6:05] i don't know what i'm saying it just
[6:06] bugs the heck out of me
[6:08] i i
[6:10] the lack of education in the world that
[6:12] we live in this morning unbelievable
[6:14] people i think it has a lot to do with
[6:16] the technology that people don't
[6:19] they don't have to learn like you used
[6:21] to learn 40 or 50 years ago they don't
[6:23] have to learn that way they've got so
[6:25] much technology that the basics they
[6:27] just
[6:28] they don't have any basics you know this
[6:31] morning and when you get around
[6:33] you know i don't i haven't been a
[6:34] service manager in a long time but when
[6:36] you get around younger younger people
[6:39] and you try to use critical thinking
[6:42] type of skills
[6:43] that's too sometimes it's just too hard
[6:45] they just they want to know the answer
[6:47] up front and stay
[6:49] first and that's not how life is that's
[6:51] not how a christian is sometimes you got
[6:54] to solve the problem to get the answer
[6:56] you got to go through the struggle you
[6:58] got to go through the word of god and
[6:59] you got to go through prayer and fasting
[7:01] and believing to get the answer
[7:03] sometimes sometimes the answer doesn't
[7:05] come first but i was thinking this
[7:07] morning this
[7:09] this was the devotional this morning and
[7:11] i'm totally off my point
[7:14] if you travel with me to the third
[7:16] chapter of deuteronomy you know moses
[7:18] wasn't allowed to go over into the
[7:21] the promised land
[7:22] but uh i'll just read what the
[7:24] scriptures this morning it's at the
[7:26] third chapter starting at about i won't
[7:28] read this long chapter
[7:31] about the 23rd
[7:33] 23rd 22nd verse
[7:35] and you know the preachers have taught
[7:37] bro
[7:38] you know deuteronomy is a book it's got
[7:41] two laws two ways
[7:43] a way of life
[7:45] the other is a way of death and you as a
[7:48] individual this morning are going to
[7:50] choose
[7:51] either way that's going to be your
[7:52] choice no one will make it for you
[7:55] that's a choice you'll have to make for
[7:56] yourself this morning
[7:58] i'll start at the 20s you shall not fear
[8:01] them for the lord your god shall fight
[8:04] for you
[8:05] saying this morning
[8:07] you don't
[8:09] fight your battles for you if you'll
[8:10] just surrender to him this morning let
[8:13] me sought the lord at the time saying oh
[8:15] lord thou has begun to show thy servant
[8:18] my greatness my mighty hand for what god
[8:21] is there in heaven or in earth
[8:24] according to thy works and according to
[8:26] thy might i pray thee let me go over and
[8:29] see the good land that is beyond jordan
[8:33] the goodly mountains in lebanon
[8:35] and uh
[8:36] he's even asking god already told him
[8:39] several years before that he wasn't
[8:41] going to cross over but even at the end
[8:43] he's still asking that god would forgive
[8:45] him and let him cross over jordan
[8:47] and he goes on i lost my place but the
[8:50] lord was wrong with me for your sakes
[8:52] and would not hear me and the lord said
[8:55] unto me let it suffice thee speak no
[8:57] more unto me of this manner
[8:59] and get thee up to the top of pisgah and
[9:02] lift thy
[9:03] westward and northward and southward and
[9:05] eastward
[9:06] behold it was in it was thin eyes for
[9:09] thou shall not go over this jordan
[9:12] but he said by charge uh joshua and
[9:14] encourage him and strengthen him
[9:17] for he shall not
[9:18] ever before this is not so see and i was
[9:21] just thinking about i i was reading what
[9:23] brother brianna had to say about this
[9:26] and sometimes we have to make a choice
[9:29] there's two experiences where moses
[9:31] wasn't allowed to cross over
[9:33] and he had to look for at the good land
[9:35] from the top of the mountain pisgah and
[9:37] look at
[9:38] the land of milk and honey and then
[9:41] joshua was allowed to cross over
[9:44] but we don't we don't want to be like
[9:46] moses was even though he was a great
[9:48] prophet of god we want to be able to
[9:50] cross over we want that experience like
[9:52] elijah had where he was translated
[9:55] before the lord and went up into heaven
[9:57] that way and we all have to make a
[10:00] choice this morning where we're going to
[10:02] remain whether we're going to be on this
[10:04] side of the river or on the other side
[10:07] of the river and your testimony
[10:10] warning is going to determine that but
[10:12] i'll just read what brother random have
[10:13] to say before i digress here
[10:15] uh he there's some nuggets in this the
[10:18] reason that you hear me get the people
[10:20] say believe me and that's really true
[10:23] you know
[10:24] people to believe the word of god
[10:27] there's nothing impossible
[10:29] go see now that the reason i say it's
[10:31] not to believe as him certainly not is
[10:34] to believe that i have told you the
[10:35] truth sorry you sent me to do this now
[10:38] see when that
[10:40] you can get this people to believe and
[10:42] if you can even go back to that psalm we
[10:44] just read you know the bible teachers
[10:47] are spiritual angels god-given angels
[10:50] and then god calls his messengers and
[10:52] his prophets angels through and that was
[10:54] just in the psalm
[10:56] we read this morning
[10:58] to do this now we see what the angel met
[11:00] me he said if you can get these people
[11:01] to believe you peter and don pass
[11:04] and he said look on us
[11:06] is that right and elijah when all of
[11:08] them had come down there and got him
[11:10] kindly all started said if it wasn't i
[11:12] respect that this righteous man of
[11:14] jehoshaphat i wouldn't even look at you
[11:16] see
[11:17] so we can all
[11:19] nations but it's still the same god that
[11:21] leads us
[11:22] he goes on to
[11:23] know that you could send your soul to
[11:25] hell with a divine gift you know brother
[11:27] branham taught many messages about that
[11:30] you know you have to get the word of the
[11:31] lord and you have to be with the spirit
[11:33] of christ sometimes
[11:35] and you do not can't be running out
[11:37] ahead of what god wants you to do
[11:38] sometimes sure you can you have to watch
[11:41] what you're doing
[11:44] you believe moses was god's prophet and
[11:46] it goes back to what we're reading you
[11:48] know everyone knows why he didn't cross
[11:49] over before instead of speaking to the
[11:52] rock he struck the rock
[11:55] and he goes on god's prophets say amen
[11:57] he was god's prophet
[11:59] you know what he's done god told him to
[12:01] go down there and speak to the rock it
[12:02] was already smitten is that right
[12:05] instead of moses doing what god told
[12:07] them to do he went down and smote the
[12:09] rock again is that right and that's the
[12:11] same with you whatever you respect what
[12:13] he said in the beginning just through
[12:15] faith got to believe that god's going to
[12:17] do it for you
[12:18] and i lost my place here and well
[12:21] absolutely broke the entire there christ
[12:24] was spit twice he was meant once
[12:27] we him from now on is that right but
[12:30] when moses smote the rod he broke god's
[12:32] complete program
[12:33] he done exactly what god told him not to
[12:36] do see but he could
[12:39] whether it was god's will or not that
[12:41] seems strange doesn't it but it wasn't
[12:43] god will if he was a prophet he could do
[12:46] whatever he was what his power would
[12:48] permit him to do and i'm not going to
[12:49] finish reading the whole he goes on to
[12:51] talk about advise us
[12:54] he talks about how he cursed those
[12:55] children and the bears ate them up
[12:58] he talks about some other situations and
[13:00] we all have a choice how we're going to
[13:02] use the gifts that god gives us whether
[13:04] we're going to use them to bless the
[13:05] people around us or curse the people
[13:08] around us and we all have to make that
[13:10] choice and it depends on where you are
[13:12] this morning spiritually with jesus
[13:14] christ is going to determine
[13:17] the attitude you had it goes back to
[13:18] what i said earlier you know i didn't
[13:20] have a very good attitude earlier this
[13:22] week when i was screaming at something
[13:24] but i chose that attitude i chose to let
[13:27] myself get angry in the situation
[13:30] that i was in instead of just stepping
[13:32] back
[13:33] and relaxing and not worrying that's
[13:36] that's the hard thing about life anytime
[13:38] you get in hard situations
[13:41] is stepping back and being quiet enough
[13:44] to let god deal with you whether it's a
[13:46] spiritual matter or it's a financial
[13:48] matter whether it's dealing with people
[13:51] sometimes you just got to be willing to
[13:53] stop and step back and let god deal with
[13:56] you let your mind deal with you and
[13:58] maybe there's always a better way to do
[14:00] something brother david
[14:05] you love him this morning let's stand if
[14:07] we couldn't
[14:09] appreciate that and
[14:15] and you know i kind of chuckling brother
[14:18] brian
[14:18] not to make fun of him but uh
[14:20] unfortunately
[14:22] it seems like the older we get we kind
[14:24] of get on the cranky side
[14:26] side every once in a while sister
[14:28] janet's going that way but i i i i'm
[14:31] kind of like brother brian i have to
[14:32] speak for myself sometimes i have to
[14:34] just sit back and say lord what is wrong
[14:36] with me
[14:37] amen that god is good to us in me and i
[14:40] sing that little course isn't he

[54:20] are they not written in the book of
[54:24] shema the prophet and of edu the the
[54:26] seer concerning genealogies and there
[54:29] were between rehoboam and jeroboam
[54:33] continually and rehoboam slept with his
[54:35] fathers and was buried in the city of
[54:37] david and abigail now his son
[54:40] reigned in his dead may the lord add a
[54:43] blessing to the reading of the word you
[54:44] may be seated this morning
[54:47] if i put a little thought or a little
[54:49] title to this thought this morning
[54:52] it'd be
[54:55] your heart's
[54:57] not prepared
[54:59] your heart's not prepared
[55:02] so we just look at this for a little
[55:03] while and try not to hold you too long
[55:05] this morning but we just want to
[55:08] uh just look at these things just for a
[55:10] little bit this morning and try to
[55:12] hope that the lord would give us
[55:14] something this morning out of his word
[55:16] this morning amen
[55:19] it's not being prepared
[55:21] and it sit here
[55:22] take my thought and i'm taking my
[55:24] thoughts from uh verse 14
[55:27] and said and he did evil
[55:29] because he prepared not his heart
[55:32] to seek the lord he did evil
[55:35] because he prepared
[55:37] not his heart
[55:39] to seek the lord
[55:41] and i was thinking about that and
[55:43] you know the sum of his life it said
[55:45] that he did evil
[55:47] in the sight of the lord
[55:50] you know the summary of every one of our
[55:52] lives when it's all said and done
[55:55] when everything is over with and and and
[55:57] and everything is done and everything is
[56:00] over
[56:01] the summary of our life
[56:03] will either be evil
[56:05] or right
[56:06] in the sight of the lord
[56:08] i hope that mine is right in the sight
[56:11] of the lord and only way it can be right
[56:13] is if my heart is prepared to seek the
[56:16] lord see it said there that his heart
[56:19] that he did not his heart was not was uh
[56:21] not prepared to seek the lord and
[56:23] therefore he done evil in his sight
[56:26] now just for a little background
[56:28] maybe rehab
[56:30] he might not have been as half as bad as
[56:32] some others
[56:34] you could talk about a lot of people
[56:36] like that well you know he's not half as
[56:38] bad as this fella or this fellow or
[56:40] she's not half as bad as this sister or
[56:43] that sister whatever it may be but maybe
[56:45] you know they might say well he wasn't
[56:47] not half as bad as some others he wasn't
[56:50] a he was not a ab
[56:52] you remember the sin of abraham he he
[56:55] married up with an unbeliever and the
[56:57] scripture says we not we shouldn't be uh
[56:59] uniquely oak together with uh with
[57:01] unbelievers
[57:03] how many young people you that seek
[57:08] for something
[57:11] because we wouldn't want to be an
[57:12] equipped together
[57:15] so he wasn't an ahab or a manasseh
[57:18] and i looked up manasseh and it says
[57:20] manasseh
[57:21] he turned against god
[57:23] and worshiped every kind of pagan deity
[57:28] so he wasn't this here reborns he just
[57:31] said that he did not prepare his heart
[57:33] therefore he didn't even on the side of
[57:34] god now he like i said he wasn't as bad
[57:37] as as some of the other have his men but
[57:39] he was he wasn't i have or a manasseh it
[57:41] says but and manasseh turned against god
[57:44] worship every kind of pagan deity he was
[57:46] guilty of immorality
[57:49] he practiced every conceivable evil and
[57:51] perversion he devoted himself to
[57:54] witchcraft and was a murderer even
[57:57] sacrificing his sons to a pagan god
[58:02] so here just reborn he wasn't as half as
[58:05] bad as these others
[58:07] but
[58:08] he did not
[58:09] see god's
[58:11] face because his heart was not prepared
[58:16] sometimes he did good
[58:18] and that's even every one of us
[58:20] sometimes he did good
[58:22] the sum was he did evil
[58:27] and so i looked up his mother's name it
[58:29] said there in the scripture we read
[58:30] nemaya and she was a ammonitis and she
[58:34] was one of solomon's wives out of the
[58:36] thousands that he had this was one of
[58:39] solomon's wife and this is one of
[58:41] solomon's this is one that solomon
[58:44] favored a whole lot this nehemiah
[58:47] so i looked up her and did some research
[58:49] and said solomon's wife the my son and
[58:52] his wife who
[58:53] he favored most
[58:55] and
[58:56] ammonites
[58:57] they weren't highly
[58:59] regarded of israel
[59:01] and together with the moabites they
[59:03] hired balaam to curse israel
[59:07] so that's who the ammonites were and so
[59:10] this this woman this wife of solomon
[59:13] this was real boy william's mother
[59:16] and brother madam city like this
[59:19] said that the the mother was the fifth
[59:22] gospel
[59:23] in other words
[59:25] she's the one and let me just read it to
[59:27] you if i can
[59:28] amen out the other message in invasion
[59:33] in the usa and brother brown preached
[59:35] this on mother's day
[59:38] now listen what he says he said to you
[59:40] little mothers here this morning that's
[59:42] been real mothers and i know there's
[59:44] many of you i thank every one of you he
[59:46] said let me tell you something he said
[59:48] god bless you to you that's real mother
[59:50] she's saying god bless you
[59:52] you're the fifth gospel
[59:56] he said let me tell you
[59:58] what that what's in there for your child
[59:59] just a little thing cause bro and he
[1:00:01] goes on to tell about how that the
[1:00:04] mother she's the fifth gospel because
[1:00:06] she teaches her children right to love
[1:00:08] god and to to to honor god and to serve
[1:00:11] god
[1:00:13] he said any good true loyal mother that
[1:00:15] would take your little babies instead of
[1:00:17] sending them to picture shows and dances
[1:00:19] and so forth like that some
[1:00:22] legs and and and and or her laughing and
[1:00:25] teaching about the lord jesus christ
[1:00:28] he said to his mother
[1:00:30] i've been so and he began to say i've
[1:00:32] been so deceived by this and this mother
[1:00:35] and talking about this one man said he
[1:00:37] said mother i believe you're about the
[1:00:39] only sweetheart i really have a woman
[1:00:42] that's true to me and sticks to me
[1:00:43] that's a mother's love
[1:00:45] that's a real mother that put her arms
[1:00:47] around her baby regardless whether he's
[1:00:50] right or wrong she goes right on to
[1:00:54] him and if a mother can think that of
[1:00:56] her baby how much more will god
[1:00:58] thinking of his you see you stay right
[1:01:00] with him
[1:01:02] amen talking about the mother being the
[1:01:03] fifth gospel so in here you know we
[1:01:06] we're influenced by
[1:01:08] uh uh either
[1:01:10] the the the the mom or the dad whatever
[1:01:14] you know we could like you you take two
[1:01:16] couples maybe they're unequally oak
[1:01:18] together and for some reason and and
[1:01:20] maybe one's a believer one's not a
[1:01:22] believer and it depends on how the child
[1:01:24] which way the the the the child or the
[1:01:27] children lean to that's the way they'll
[1:01:29] go sometimes
[1:01:33] if the mother don't teach them right at
[1:01:35] home because usually
[1:01:36] you know usually brethren said this
[1:01:38] about on influence he said that the
[1:01:41] mother sometimes it's the one that they
[1:01:43] they take a first step by and they say
[1:01:46] their first words by all them and
[1:01:48] sometimes if they're not influenced
[1:01:50] right in the beginning they'll go wrong
[1:01:56] they'll do it wrong
[1:01:57] and so this woman here this nema rehab's
[1:02:01] mother that we read about she was an
[1:02:03] idol worshiper adulteress woman a man
[1:02:07] she she was one that probably she might
[1:02:09] have told uh and we know how solomon was
[1:02:12] how that solomon prayed when he first
[1:02:15] became king he said lord i don't even
[1:02:17] know how to come in and go out and you
[1:02:20] gave me these people to be in charge to
[1:02:22] be ruler to be king over i don't even
[1:02:24] know how to come in and go out lord
[1:02:26] would you would you help me lord would
[1:02:28] you lead me would you guide me and the
[1:02:31] bible says because he didn't ask for
[1:02:33] wealth he didn't ask anything he said
[1:02:35] god gave him wisdom of how to
[1:02:38] lead and guide his people israel
[1:02:43] but usually in a message brother
[1:02:45] pre-influenced the mother usually there
[1:02:47] with us to take their first step
[1:02:49] or their first words or like we said
[1:02:52] would teach them about jesus
[1:02:56] sometimes they might teach them about
[1:02:58] their own thoughts or whatever they
[1:03:00] think especially if she's not a real
[1:03:02] true believer
[1:03:07] and so
[1:03:08] you know abraham lincoln he said if i
[1:03:11] can give any credit to
[1:03:12] anyone that would be my
[1:03:14] mother said to how she she taught me to
[1:03:17] love and honor jesus
[1:03:20] she told me how to pray and to read his
[1:03:22] word so if any honor would go to anyone
[1:03:25] it would be my mother
[1:03:26] that's the words of abraham lincoln in
[1:03:29] other words and i think mother brother
[1:03:30] made this statement one time he said a a
[1:03:33] a real godly woman
[1:03:35] a real woman that's godly is the
[1:03:38] backbone to any
[1:03:42] nation so
[1:03:45] depends on how she conducts herself
[1:03:48] hey man
[1:03:49] how how she acts and how she does
[1:03:52] hey man
[1:03:53] i thought about and you you you take
[1:03:56] many examples and it just depends you
[1:03:57] know because you get so many you know
[1:03:59] and it's it's strange how that these
[1:04:02] things work because we're taught by the
[1:04:04] prophet of god that the blood comes from
[1:04:06] the male
[1:04:07] amen the blood comes from the male but
[1:04:09] when you get together you know so many
[1:04:11] chromosomes of the woman so many other
[1:04:13] men and sometimes they'll look like the
[1:04:15] mother instead of the dad
[1:04:18] that god that most my children my two
[1:04:20] look like her instead of me
[1:04:23] but i'm just saying it and then they
[1:04:24] picked up characteristics
[1:04:26] along the way
[1:04:27] and maybe it goes way back and many
[1:04:29] generations they'll pick up and say well
[1:04:31] you that i remember how that's how
[1:04:33] grandpa used to act like how grandma
[1:04:35] used to act
[1:04:37] but you know we don't have to be like
[1:04:38] that
[1:04:41] amen because we're born again brother
[1:04:43] raven said he realized that hey listen
[1:04:45] i'm not a child or a son i've got
[1:04:47] charles and nellie brenham but i'm a
[1:04:49] child of god this morning
[1:04:51] amen oh hallelujah and we sometimes we
[1:04:54] would say well it's just my way that's
[1:04:57] why i know it's the gadgets they got a
[1:04:59] temper or it's this or that and that's
[1:05:00] my but if it's god's your life
[1:05:04] amen
[1:05:06] like that brother was saying this
[1:05:08] morning sometimes we need to just stop
[1:05:10] back just step a little bit say god i
[1:05:13] don't know what why everything is going
[1:05:14] wrong today but lord i know you've got
[1:05:16] everything under control would you lead
[1:05:18] me with your guidance help me to say the
[1:05:20] right things help me to do the right
[1:05:21] thing say the right words lord
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:26] and so we find out another example in
[1:05:29] the bible
[1:05:30] you take you take a you look at
[1:05:33] isaac and rebecca both of them godly
[1:05:36] parents amen but in there they had a son
[1:05:39] that loved the birthright isaac amen and
[1:05:42] they had one that had despised their
[1:05:43] birthright and that was esau both of
[1:05:46] them being born to godly parents
[1:05:49] so sometimes it's not all together
[1:05:52] amen the way the dad is or the way the
[1:05:55] mom is it's sometimes it recalls we did
[1:05:58] not prepare our hearts to seek after god
[1:06:01] i wonder this morning when we come here
[1:06:03] this morning and you say well brother
[1:06:05] tom ain't here and then we're gonna have
[1:06:07] a but lord let it not be that way let me
[1:06:09] come to the house of god let me prepare
[1:06:11] my heart lord to seek your face lord
[1:06:15] because of my dog i'll do evil on your
[1:06:17] side so lord let me prepare my heart let
[1:06:20] me be right lord let my attitude be
[1:06:23] right let my thinking be right lord that
[1:06:25] i can seek your face lord
[1:06:30] so many examples there was adam and eve
[1:06:34] in the garden of eden
[1:06:36] amen
[1:06:38] and uh and brother branham tells us amen
[1:06:40] that they taught
[1:06:42] their boys
[1:06:43] cain and abel that was fruit of the
[1:06:45] garden what drove them out of the garden
[1:06:48] of eden but they had lied to them amen
[1:06:51] brother said adam and eve
[1:06:54] they're boys then but abel amen he had a
[1:06:58] heart that was prepared to seek god and
[1:07:01] because his heart was prepared to seek
[1:07:03] god by revelation he knew what it what
[1:07:06] it was it caused the fall in the garden
[1:07:09] amen what happened between his mom and
[1:07:11] the serpent in that way he could offer
[1:07:13] blood
[1:07:15] a blood sacrifice why because he
[1:07:17] prepared his heart to seek god
[1:07:21] cain on the other hand
[1:07:23] didn't prepare his heart
[1:07:27] and even
[1:07:28] when he'd seen
[1:07:30] abel's sacrifice being accepted by god
[1:07:33] the bible says his countenance got kind
[1:07:35] of rough
[1:07:38] i wonder sometimes
[1:07:40] if our catalans don't become that way
[1:07:42] when we see other people getting blessed
[1:07:44] amen we see other people getting blessed
[1:07:46] in the house of god god i want everybody
[1:07:49] to be blessed
[1:07:50] i won't i don't know about why i hate to
[1:07:52] see anybody suffer hey brother david i
[1:07:54] hate to see anybody hurt i hate to see
[1:07:57] anybody sick hey man i hate to see
[1:07:59] anybody else discouraged amen i like to
[1:08:02] see people blessed amen well there's a
[1:08:04] lot of that because amen they they they
[1:08:07] got the right attitude and they didn't
[1:08:09] prepare this
[1:08:12] big god
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:15] then they get kind of offended when they
[1:08:17] see somebody else getting blessed
[1:08:20] amen
[1:08:21] oh my
[1:08:22] and so there was the kings eating
[1:08:25] because of what he thought because he
[1:08:27] didn't want to seek god
[1:08:29] amen he thought what abel's doing that
[1:08:31] that just a mess
[1:08:32] he's taking that lamb
[1:08:34] wrapping a a grape vine around him and
[1:08:36] bringing them to this altar amen and
[1:08:38] laying them up on that altar and taking
[1:08:40] a sharp rock and
[1:08:42] and beating his neck to the blood is
[1:08:44] covering his whole body and everything
[1:08:46] the blood's going down that lamb oh but
[1:08:48] abel knew that hey it's blood amen that
[1:08:51] got us in this mess in the first place
[1:08:53] amen and it's gonna take blood to get us
[1:08:55] back into life with the father and then
[1:08:58] it's gonna take blood to get us back in
[1:09:00] fellowship with the father
[1:09:03] mccain didn't want to go that route and
[1:09:06] the bible says his countenance became
[1:09:07] raw
[1:09:09] amen
[1:09:10] so
[1:09:10] god speaks to him and says hey listen
[1:09:13] if you do like your brother
[1:09:16] you'll be accepted
[1:09:18] if you do like abel did amen you'll be
[1:09:20] accepted you'll be good you'll do all
[1:09:23] right but he didn't want to go that way
[1:09:26] one place the problem god said here it
[1:09:28] is lord you just take it or leave it and
[1:09:30] god left it why because
[1:09:33] heart wasn't prepared oh i hope our
[1:09:36] hearts prepared this morning because i
[1:09:38] don't want to i don't want to get in
[1:09:39] that attitude here lord i'm at the
[1:09:41] service this morning and suddenly here
[1:09:43] it's sunday morning i'm coming in lord
[1:09:45] i'm gonna i'm gonna do what i i'm
[1:09:47] supposed to do you either take it or
[1:09:49] leave it
[1:09:51] and maybe he'll leave it
[1:09:54] because our heart's not prepared
[1:09:57] i want my heart to be prepared
[1:09:59] amen
[1:10:00] oh oh there's been many times when our
[1:10:04] heart ain't prepared and the prophet of
[1:10:06] god said it like this on the message
[1:10:08] influence he said 98 of the time depends
[1:10:11] on a certain atmosphere in a certain
[1:10:13] environment that children live under
[1:10:16] amen if they live in the right
[1:10:17] atmosphere in the right environment 98
[1:10:20] of the time they'll do right and they'll
[1:10:22] go right
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:27] i remember many a time
[1:10:29] and you heard over the course of the
[1:10:30] years
[1:10:32] amen
[1:10:33] here's a young man
[1:10:34] or an elderly part maybe a middle-aged
[1:10:37] man or
[1:10:38] a young woman or a middle-aged woman or
[1:10:40] whatever kneeling down at the altar and
[1:10:42] they say there's here's an answer to
[1:10:44] mom's prayer
[1:10:45] right here
[1:10:47] amen an answer to a mom's prayer because
[1:10:49] a mom would be praying for a kid say man
[1:10:52] and man and the child finally comes
[1:10:56] amen and say i need your lord and they
[1:10:59] said there's an answer to
[1:11:01] uh
[1:11:02] a mother's prayer oh help us lord
[1:11:06] there wasn't now this real boom he said
[1:11:08] that like i said the psalm
[1:11:10] but there's some of his his was that he
[1:11:12] did evil and it wasn't maybe because of
[1:11:14] his dad or her mother
[1:11:18] maybe he you know maybe i don't know how
[1:11:20] his mother taught him or whatever but
[1:11:22] maybe she said you know you know what uh
[1:11:24] i love your dad and i'm your favorite
[1:11:26] that one of your favorite i'm your
[1:11:27] favorite wife out of all the rest
[1:11:30] i'm your dad's favorite
[1:11:33] and he lets me keep these idols and
[1:11:34] everything and all that
[1:11:37] and
[1:11:38] and i i don't have to go to the same
[1:11:41] church that he's going to i don't have
[1:11:42] to believe it i don't know if that's
[1:11:44] what it was
[1:11:45] but maybe it wasn't because of his dad
[1:11:46] or because like i said his dad we we
[1:11:49] started off with he saw he wanted he
[1:11:51] wanted god's guidance and god gave him
[1:11:54] wisdom amen to lead god's people but it
[1:11:57] was maybe not because of his death or
[1:11:58] his mom's influence but it was because
[1:12:01] he didn't prepare his heart to seek god
[1:12:03] you may be here this morning and it
[1:12:05] might not be because of your dad and
[1:12:06] mom's influence amen that you're going
[1:12:09] wrong or doing wrong but it might be
[1:12:10] because that you're not preparing your
[1:12:13] heart to seek after god
[1:12:16] so when i come to the house of god i
[1:12:18] want to say god here i
[1:12:20] am
[1:12:21] i want to prepare my heart lord i want
[1:12:24] to make sure i'm ready i want to make
[1:12:26] sure i'm ready i don't know who's
[1:12:27] preaching lord but i pray oh god that
[1:12:29] them words that he's preaching i speak
[1:12:31] to my heart this morning let my heart be
[1:12:33] prepared let my mind be prepared let my
[1:12:36] soul be prepared lord
[1:12:41] let's just look at this for a little bit
[1:12:44] number one
[1:12:46] rehoboam
[1:12:47] he did not begin life
[1:12:49] with seeking the lord
[1:12:53] that's the main thing he didn't begin
[1:12:54] his life with seeking the lord
[1:12:57] now imagine
[1:12:59] you know his dad did because he saw the
[1:13:01] lord as we said and god gave him wisdom
[1:13:04] whatever you do in life
[1:13:06] wherever you go and brother ben said
[1:13:08] even in marriage
[1:13:10] you need to pray about it
[1:13:13] amen you need even in choosing your
[1:13:15] pastor you need to pray about it
[1:13:18] amen cause your pastor can be a big
[1:13:21] influence on your whatever
[1:13:25] amen brother brown called it that way he
[1:13:27] said you take a church sometimes in a
[1:13:30] church and they look at the way their
[1:13:31] pastor you said sometimes you look into
[1:13:32] other people you know that's how the
[1:13:34] pastor acts and he's judged his head a
[1:13:36] certain way he said you want your
[1:13:38] congregation they'll shake their head
[1:13:39] that way
[1:13:42] but i don't want to shake my head the
[1:13:44] way brother homer shakes his head or not
[1:13:46] i want to i want to prepare my heart to
[1:13:48] meet god
[1:13:50] amen i i remember brother homer would
[1:13:53] quit today and say i don't believe this
[1:13:54] message i don't want nothing to do with
[1:13:56] it god help me to keep pressing on
[1:14:00] help me to keep pressing lord help me to
[1:14:02] keep pushing lord help me to keep my
[1:14:05] faith set on you lord
[1:14:09] amen
[1:14:11] so
[1:14:12] he didn't start out right
[1:14:14] hey man he didn't start his life
[1:14:16] like his dad did
[1:14:18] by seeking the lord
[1:14:21] amen so whatever we got what if we do
[1:14:23] you need to seek him
[1:14:26] he saw counsel
[1:14:28] without prayer
[1:14:31] well i'll just get somebody and i i
[1:14:33] won't pray about the situation i'll just
[1:14:35] open the senior council and see what
[1:14:37] they have to say
[1:14:39] and i won't pray about the situation
[1:14:41] brothers and sisters young people we
[1:14:43] better pray more than we ever had
[1:14:46] amen we look at the hour we're living in
[1:14:48] look at that look at everything around
[1:14:50] us amen look at the corruption going on
[1:14:52] amen if we ever
[1:14:54] needed to pray we need to pray now if we
[1:14:57] ever needed to prepare our hearts we
[1:14:59] need to prepare them now
[1:15:02] tomorrow may be too late
[1:15:04] amen so i want to not take up counsel
[1:15:07] without prayer amen but i want to seek
[1:15:10] god's counsel with prayer hey man and if
[1:15:13] i should talk to somebody i'd say god
[1:15:15] you point me to the right person to talk
[1:15:17] to let me not talk about
[1:15:20] somebody that's a wishy-washy that stays
[1:15:22] out out of church half the time but
[1:15:24] don't come to church half the time and
[1:15:26] when they come they ain't really here
[1:15:28] they don't enter
[1:15:29] in they don't do anything they don't
[1:15:31] back up the pastor they don't say they
[1:15:33] leave it all on the song leader to
[1:15:35] worship god let us lord let me not seek
[1:15:37] that counsel but let me find somebody
[1:15:40] that loves you that honors you that
[1:15:42] believes you that will do your will lord
[1:15:44] let me see that kind of counsel not only
[1:15:47] that but let me do it with prayer lord
[1:15:51] let me do it with prayer
[1:15:55] another thing he listen to others
[1:15:59] i don't want to listen to anybody
[1:16:00] especially if they ain't
[1:16:04] saying
[1:16:07] he he listened to others
[1:16:10] amen and he commenced his life without
[1:16:13] god
[1:16:15] and usually when we do that
[1:16:17] it always ends in a failure
[1:16:20] lord let me not commence
[1:16:22] you amen
[1:16:24] and he he
[1:16:26] in the industry he didn't begin life
[1:16:28] would see he chose the worst
[1:16:32] counselors
[1:16:33] he he he he chose the worst of the
[1:16:36] counselors he chose the younger and the
[1:16:39] prouder
[1:16:40] the ones that probably would take his
[1:16:42] side
[1:16:43] sometimes that's what we do we don't
[1:16:45] prepare our hearts right so we take
[1:16:47] people
[1:16:48] counsel or we go try to find somebody
[1:16:50] that will take our side on the situation
[1:16:53] and take instead of taking god's side on
[1:16:55] the situation
[1:16:57] because our hearts not prepared
[1:17:01] they saw the worst of the counselors the
[1:17:04] younger and the prouder
[1:17:06] those that didn't really respect god or
[1:17:09] his word
[1:17:11] he chose them
[1:17:14] oh my and he rejected divine wisdom
[1:17:17] he rejected the wisdom of the wiser he
[1:17:20] rejected the wisdom of god
[1:17:23] and took those who didn't care too much
[1:17:25] about god's word
[1:17:29] he committed folly by threatening the
[1:17:32] people and refusing their just demands
[1:17:35] because they came to him
[1:17:37] but people came to rehoboam said hey
[1:17:39] your your father he taxed us heavy and
[1:17:42] grievously and we wanted but he he put
[1:17:44] more
[1:17:46] demands on them and he made their taxes
[1:17:48] even more heavier and burdensome
[1:17:51] he didn't listen to their just demands
[1:17:54] amen because he didn't have any of his
[1:17:56] father's wisdom because he didn't start
[1:17:58] out right by seeking the lord
[1:18:01] oh
[1:18:02] and that holy and righteous without
[1:18:05] being guided by the lord in his word
[1:18:08] we'll come to church share on sunday
[1:18:10] morning and wednesday night and we just
[1:18:12] go through the motions
[1:18:15] amen i don't want to just go through the
[1:18:17] motions i want to make sure something's
[1:18:18] on the inside of the inside i might not
[1:18:21] raise my hands i may not shout i may not
[1:18:24] dance but there's something on the
[1:18:25] inside of me that's raising them and
[1:18:28] there's something from on the inside
[1:18:29] that said lord i want more of you lord i
[1:18:32] want your word to be number one in my
[1:18:33] life
[1:18:38] i don't want to act holy and righteous
[1:18:41] amen and passing all them things without
[1:18:43] being guided by the lord in his word
[1:18:47] oh lord help me
[1:18:49] let my heart be prepared number two
[1:18:52] he showed no heart in seeking the lord
[1:18:57] in other words he he he didn't show no
[1:18:59] uh he wasn't jealous about seeking the
[1:19:02] lord and he might have could have called
[1:19:05] back in the day
[1:19:06] as we all say back in the day
[1:19:09] maybe he obeyed the prophet's voice
[1:19:12] and maybe he could remember how it was
[1:19:14] when he was young and i was thinking
[1:19:16] about that and i thought you know i can
[1:19:19] remember some of those days
[1:19:21] i remember when we first came this
[1:19:23] message 1969
[1:19:28] over 50 years ago
[1:19:31] my mom and dad
[1:19:32] was getting some books
[1:19:34] my mom was getting them from her aunt
[1:19:36] sister lucy hester
[1:19:38] and so they decided to go to hardy
[1:19:39] arkansas get baptized
[1:19:41] well brother earl martin wasn't there at
[1:19:43] the time he was gone and so brother
[1:19:45] herbicide were baptized my mom and
[1:19:48] dad and so
[1:19:51] and i remember when you know we come and
[1:19:53] brother david we get together
[1:19:55] and then
[1:19:56] that all they talked about was the word
[1:19:58] of the lord
[1:19:59] that's all they talked about
[1:20:02] now i always remember this
[1:20:04] i'll remember i was about oh i forget 10
[1:20:07] 9 10 and when we first came in the
[1:20:09] message nine years old 1969
[1:20:13] and i forget how about a year or so my
[1:20:16] mom was ordering some clothes out in the
[1:20:18] den
[1:20:19] and she goes david i'd be surprised if
[1:20:21] you see her 12th birthday that's just
[1:20:23] how close we thought it was
[1:20:25] and we lived that way
[1:20:28] we lived that way
[1:20:30] amen but today we're probably
[1:20:33] i remember we used to get the records
[1:20:34] amen first record the red record uh the
[1:20:37] great harlot and many of the
[1:20:40] messages that brother
[1:20:42] brown preached on
[1:20:44] and then i remember we'd get together my
[1:20:47] it didn't matter if they had to go to
[1:20:49] work the next day or what
[1:20:51] they'd stayed in fellowship talked about
[1:20:53] the goodness of the lord
[1:20:55] hey man like that song his goodness is
[1:20:57] running after me thank god amen i'm glad
[1:21:01] it's running after me
[1:21:03] amen oh what i have to worry for what i
[1:21:05] have to be sad for his goodness has
[1:21:08] always been there his goodness has
[1:21:10] always been with me
[1:21:12] he woke me up this morning he called me
[1:21:14] in my right mind because his goodness
[1:21:17] was falling after me
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:20] thank you lord
[1:21:22] amen if i remember all these things we
[1:21:25] get together i remember one time we had
[1:21:27] brother cliff newman came by and stayed
[1:21:29] at our house
[1:21:32] just different ones
[1:21:34] how we talk about
[1:21:36] the lord how we get together
[1:21:39] playing tape on sunday morning because
[1:21:41] we didn't know hardly no ministers or
[1:21:42] not so we just get together
[1:21:45] somebody's house
[1:21:48] play tapes
[1:21:51] now maybe a young man nine years old 10
[1:21:53] years old i thought this is kind of
[1:21:54] strange
[1:21:56] and if i hadn't prepared my heart to
[1:21:58] seek god i would still think it was
[1:22:00] strange
[1:22:01] amen
[1:22:02] thank god that i prepared my heart to
[1:22:04] seek after him i didn't have to wait for
[1:22:07] my dad or mom amen to do this because
[1:22:09] there's a lot of a lot of parents back
[1:22:11] then that they went off the deep end or
[1:22:13] they ain't serving god now
[1:22:17] but i thank god
[1:22:19] that i prepared my heart to seek after
[1:22:21] him
[1:22:23] he probably in rehoboam probably could
[1:22:25] remember these things he'd already could
[1:22:27] remember his dad solomon telling him the
[1:22:29] testimonies about his
[1:22:31] david how about how did he kill that
[1:22:33] bear and how did he kill that line how
[1:22:35] did he kill goliath
[1:22:38] he remembered how all this
[1:22:41] was
[1:22:43] but he forsook
[1:22:45] the word of god himself
[1:22:49] i wonder what do our children
[1:22:51] see in us
[1:22:53] it's been my life what do my children
[1:22:55] see in my life what do my grandkids see
[1:22:58] in my life
[1:23:00] amen oh they might not my grandkids they
[1:23:03] might not understand why we do some
[1:23:05] things but i want them to know that
[1:23:07] there's a living god
[1:23:09] that there's a reality in serving god
[1:23:11] there's a reality in getting your heart
[1:23:13] right with god there's a reality and get
[1:23:15] your heart prepared to seek after god
[1:23:22] he didn't
[1:23:24] prepare his heart and he forsook the
[1:23:26] word of god
[1:23:27] he even winked at the most horrible
[1:23:30] crimes
[1:23:31] when he ought to be ju when he ought to
[1:23:33] have judged them
[1:23:35] and found out what the will of the lord
[1:23:37] was to do about him
[1:23:39] oh
[1:23:40] ain't that about the way he is sometimes
[1:23:42] with us in this hour that we're living
[1:23:44] in because we didn't prepare our hearts
[1:23:47] to seek after god and we hear things we
[1:23:50] and we just wink at it
[1:23:53] well that's all right but god
[1:23:56] he don't weaken ignorance no more at one
[1:23:58] time he did we get ignorant but now he
[1:24:00] calls all men under repentance
[1:24:05] i'm saying lord help me then
[1:24:07] let me make sure that i'm right with you
[1:24:09] lord let me not wink at what anybody
[1:24:11] does but let me pray for him
[1:24:14] amen let me pray for him lord
[1:24:17] amen
[1:24:19] that's what i want to do lord
[1:24:21] let me let me if i have to judge let me
[1:24:23] do it according to your word lord what
[1:24:25] your word says
[1:24:27] not only that but he failed his father's
[1:24:30] sins in other words he started marrying
[1:24:33] all kinds of uh different women and all
[1:24:35] that and and and failing his father's
[1:24:37] sins he didn't he didn't see what had
[1:24:39] happened to his father the way the route
[1:24:41] that he took
[1:24:43] by
[1:24:44] living with about having so many wives
[1:24:46] but he took the wire out of his father
[1:24:49] because he didn't prepare his heart to
[1:24:51] seek after god
[1:24:53] and finally he visited himself with
[1:24:56] building and trying to make a name
[1:24:58] oh that's what we do sometimes we want
[1:25:01] to bend yourself in other things we're
[1:25:03] trying to make a name and try to make a
[1:25:05] name for ourselves and trying to instead
[1:25:06] of trying to please see what god has for
[1:25:09] me to do and then my actions and my life
[1:25:12] be pleasing to god
[1:25:16] oh that's what he did he began to busy
[1:25:18] himself with building trying to make a
[1:25:20] name but what about your worship toward
[1:25:22] god what about your attitude to god this
[1:25:24] morning
[1:25:27] my wife read me a quote the other day
[1:25:31] where a
[1:25:32] great preacher said it like this he said
[1:25:36] and then if
[1:25:39] if i get on your pet peeve i'm sorry but
[1:25:41] he said a lot of people may pay more
[1:25:43] attention
[1:25:45] to their dogs and cats
[1:25:47] than their own soul
[1:25:51] now if you've got a dog in the house or
[1:25:53] dogs
[1:25:54] i mean if there's farming country out
[1:25:55] here i understand all that
[1:25:57] but what about god what's more important
[1:26:01] than things that perish and i understand
[1:26:03] hey don't get me wrong i understand if
[1:26:04] you got a pet or a dog or whatever you
[1:26:07] need to take care of it you need to you
[1:26:09] need to treat it right you need to take
[1:26:10] care of it you need to feed it but what
[1:26:12] about your soul sometimes we sometimes
[1:26:15] we mess around with the trivial things
[1:26:17] amen how this should do and how this
[1:26:19] should be how this should go how this
[1:26:21] woman how this sister should guess how
[1:26:23] this brother should act and we forget
[1:26:25] about our own soul
[1:26:32] amen
[1:26:34] so what about our worship toward god no
[1:26:37] matter what anybody else does i'm going
[1:26:39] to serve the lord no matter what anybody
[1:26:42] else is doing i'm going to serve god i
[1:26:44] don't care if anybody quits i don't give
[1:26:46] the whole church quits i'm going to
[1:26:48] serve god
[1:26:49] joshua made this statement one time he
[1:26:51] said hey what are you going to do are
[1:26:53] you going to serve the gods that your
[1:26:54] father served on the other side of the
[1:26:56] flood
[1:26:58] are you going to serve the true living
[1:27:00] god
[1:27:01] he said you decide
[1:27:04] he said you're a decision
[1:27:06] he said for me and my house we're gonna
[1:27:08] serve god so that's what we gotta do we
[1:27:11] gotta make up in our minds god i don't
[1:27:13] care what anybody else does i'm gonna
[1:27:15] seek your face let my heart be prepared
[1:27:18] when i come to the house of god so i can
[1:27:20] seek your face lord
[1:27:23] let me make that decision
[1:27:25] that i don't care what anybody else does
[1:27:28] i'm going to serve you lord
[1:27:30] i don't care if everybody quits i'm
[1:27:32] going to serve you lord i don't care if
[1:27:34] this one gives up this one quits this
[1:27:36] one throws in the tile i'm going to
[1:27:38] serve you lord
[1:27:42] another thing the third thing
[1:27:44] he wasn't fixed and persevering and
[1:27:47] seeking the lord
[1:27:49] he didn't persevere
[1:27:52] though he might have tried
[1:27:54] amen i
[1:27:56] he might have been law for about three
[1:27:58] years and in that time he might have
[1:28:01] prospered
[1:28:03] and got all kinds of things
[1:28:06] you know
[1:28:07] got all that kind of things prospered
[1:28:09] himself did all kinds of things but i
[1:28:11] remember that that ritual that came to
[1:28:14] jesus
[1:28:15] when he ran up to him the bible says he
[1:28:17] ran
[1:28:19] you don't see too many people running
[1:28:20] today
[1:28:22] he said lord what must i do to be saved
[1:28:26] and
[1:28:27] the lord jesus quoted him the
[1:28:29] commandments
[1:28:30] defraud not
[1:28:32] honor thy father and mother
[1:28:34] don't lie
[1:28:35] don't bear false witnesses
[1:28:38] and so we find out in the scripture that
[1:28:40] this young man that came to jesus he
[1:28:42] must have been a pretty
[1:28:44] good boy because he said i've kept all
[1:28:45] this for my youth up
[1:28:48] i've done all these things i haven't uh
[1:28:51] i have i've honored my mom and dad
[1:28:53] i haven't lied
[1:28:55] i haven't done all these things i've
[1:28:57] kept all these commandments from my
[1:28:59] youth up but jesus been that god prophet
[1:29:02] looked in his life and said there's one
[1:29:04] thing that i likest
[1:29:06] you go and sell what you have
[1:29:08] and give to the poor and come and take
[1:29:10] up your cross and follow me
[1:29:12] and you'll have treasures in heaven
[1:29:15] he didn't see his treasures in heaven
[1:29:18] amen he did not prepare to seek god
[1:29:21] amen all he wanted
[1:29:23] he must have something
[1:29:26] must have attracted his attention though
[1:29:27] or he went and ran
[1:29:29] but when he found out what he had to do
[1:29:33] i don't know if the lord would held him
[1:29:34] to it or not reaction
[1:29:36] was what his action was going to be on
[1:29:39] the mission
[1:29:42] but all he said
[1:29:44] the scripture says
[1:29:46] that he bowed his head and walked away
[1:29:49] because
[1:29:50] about all these things lord i want to
[1:29:52] make heaven
[1:29:54] my home
[1:29:55] i want to seek your face lord
[1:29:57] i want to do what you told me to do lord
[1:30:00] i'll come and i'll sell everything i'll
[1:30:01] give to the poor i'll take up my cross
[1:30:03] because taking up the cross back then
[1:30:05] wasn't like hanging your cross in your
[1:30:07] rearview mirror
[1:30:09] today
[1:30:11] to take up your crossback then meant
[1:30:13] death to fall of christ
[1:30:18] meant death even
[1:30:21] i looked it out in history states at the
[1:30:23] romans
[1:30:24] when they before they executed their
[1:30:26] criminals
[1:30:28] they made them carry their own
[1:30:30] cross
[1:30:32] to be crucified on
[1:30:35] can you imagine
[1:30:37] made them the criminals carried their
[1:30:39] own
[1:30:41] that they were going to be crucified on
[1:30:45] especially
[1:30:46] if you called yourself a christian
[1:30:49] and said you was a follower of the lord
[1:30:50] jesus
[1:30:52] that meant death certain death
[1:30:54] his heart wasn't right
[1:30:56] he thought maybe the lord wouldn't ask
[1:30:58] him to do this you remember naaman in
[1:31:00] the bible that had leprosy
[1:31:02] and he got kind of mad when the man of
[1:31:04] god wouldn't come into the house
[1:31:07] he said surely if he was a man of god
[1:31:08] he'd come in here and maybe wave his
[1:31:11] magic wand over me and everything i'd be
[1:31:14] all right but all he said was go give
[1:31:15] him jordan seven times
[1:31:18] is it hey these other rivers around here
[1:31:20] better than the river jordan
[1:31:24] and that servant of his said hey listen
[1:31:26] master if he'd asked you to do some
[1:31:28] great thing you'd have done it all he
[1:31:30] asked you was gonna dip seven times in
[1:31:32] jordan
[1:31:36] finally got his heart right in his
[1:31:37] attitude right and his heart prepared if
[1:31:39] he had enough he would have never got
[1:31:41] well
[1:31:42] that leprosy
[1:31:45] if he tried to take a shortcut or
[1:31:47] whatever he would have never got well
[1:31:50] the story wouldn't end in the way that
[1:31:51] we know it
[1:31:53] but because he prepared his heart
[1:31:55] and got his attitude right he went down
[1:31:58] there and dipped seven times
[1:32:01] amen oh god help us this morning
[1:32:03] to get right
[1:32:05] have our hearts to be prepared lord
[1:32:08] hey man
[1:32:09] so maybe he that's reaborn for three
[1:32:12] years he might have been low and he
[1:32:13] prospered he gained all these things hey
[1:32:16] i understand
[1:32:17] that everything that i have comes from a
[1:32:19] god
[1:32:21] the the the job that i got it comes from
[1:32:24] god the strength that i got to go on the
[1:32:26] job it comes from god
[1:32:28] amen oh
[1:32:30] i never want to i never want to belittle
[1:32:32] my god this morning
[1:32:34] everything that i have my health this
[1:32:36] morning my strength all comes from him
[1:32:39] like i said me and you all were were
[1:32:42] recipients of miracles this morning
[1:32:44] these are miracles yes sir we woke up
[1:32:47] this morning clothed in our right
[1:32:49] mind there's a lot of people that didn't
[1:32:51] wake up this morning i wonder how they
[1:32:53] would god
[1:32:56] so he prospered
[1:32:58] did all that
[1:32:59] but he didn't have
[1:33:01] no stick it
[1:33:03] no stick to it in him no gumption in him
[1:33:06] didn't have what it took on the inside
[1:33:08] to keep pressing the battle
[1:33:11] can you imagine
[1:33:14] i wonder this morning
[1:33:16] about me and you
[1:33:18] sometimes i wonder about myself
[1:33:20] no i know brother homer
[1:33:23] sometimes he he calls he calls me up
[1:33:25] every now and then said did you hear
[1:33:27] that so-and-so passed on there's a
[1:33:29] people that's been his age and maybe he
[1:33:31] gets kind of worried about you know like
[1:33:34] when's it gonna be my time or whatever
[1:33:36] but you know what he don't give up
[1:33:39] he just keeps pressing on
[1:33:41] hey man when we see the things around us
[1:33:44] the way everything's going and people
[1:33:46] quitting the message and everybody's
[1:33:48] doing this and everybody doing that god
[1:33:50] let me have something in me that'll keep
[1:33:52] me pressing on
[1:33:54] when the prophet when he lost his baby
[1:33:57] little sharon rose
[1:33:59] lost his wife he could i could see my
[1:34:01] wife but my baby
[1:34:04] and he done something to him
[1:34:08] and i remember
[1:34:10] when sister margie passed away
[1:34:12] and i thought mom i never did see
[1:34:13] brother homer i had never seen brother
[1:34:15] homer like this before because he was
[1:34:18] always jolly always you know you know
[1:34:20] how brother homer is if you know him
[1:34:23] i never had seen him that way
[1:34:25] and he said every time he start to talk
[1:34:27] about it he'd just cry and cry and he'd
[1:34:29] have to apologize i said don't apologize
[1:34:32] brother homer
[1:34:33] i said i remember especially 1959 out
[1:34:36] there in los angeles california i guess
[1:34:39] the best one i guess that robin told his
[1:34:41] life story angela's temple los angeles
[1:34:43] california
[1:34:44] 1959 and that was the flood was in 37
[1:34:48] that was 20 years later
[1:34:50] and it would became brother man said he
[1:34:51] just and he started crying
[1:34:53] at the last he said i can't go home no
[1:34:56] more
[1:34:57] he said he said there's something about
[1:34:59] it and said it seems so real
[1:35:02] like it was right there happening to him
[1:35:04] again
[1:35:06] and remember he went in there and he
[1:35:07] wanted to tell he wanted to take that
[1:35:09] took that glove off going to touch that
[1:35:11] high power line and said i'd just been a
[1:35:13] greasy spot
[1:35:16] took that pistol trying to
[1:35:18] that put it to his head trying to
[1:35:20] commit suicide wouldn't go out when he
[1:35:22] did it on the floor and it went off
[1:35:26] you remember going to that hospital
[1:35:28] brother the doctor sam and derek wanted
[1:35:30] to go down there but he went anyway
[1:35:32] said he blessed your flies from her eyes
[1:35:35] your eyes crossed
[1:35:39] he said oh god
[1:35:41] he began to pray saying it seemed like a
[1:35:43] black sheep
[1:35:45] just dropped down said he wouldn't hear
[1:35:46] my prayer
[1:35:48] and then that's when satan began to talk
[1:35:52] said all that you've done
[1:35:53] all the sick that you prayed for how you
[1:35:56] left this and then i
[1:35:59] done all this and now when it comes to
[1:36:01] your own baby he won't hear your prayer
[1:36:04] but remember
[1:36:05] i said yeah
[1:36:06] everything he was telling was the truth
[1:36:09] he said yeah i just never said something
[1:36:12] on the inside why because his heart was
[1:36:15] prepared god help me to be that way lord
[1:36:18] amen because if it ain't when something
[1:36:20] like that happens
[1:36:23] where'd you say i quit
[1:36:25] i give it up but brother bram said
[1:36:26] there's something on the inside about
[1:36:27] the size of your fingernail on the
[1:36:29] inside of the inside about the size of
[1:36:31] your little fingernail that hold hey man
[1:36:34] when that going gets rough and
[1:36:36] everything seems like it's falling apart
[1:36:38] that acre holds and grips that solid
[1:36:40] rock
[1:36:49] when they came to them and said billy
[1:36:51] did you hold your religion
[1:36:53] he said no it helped me
[1:36:56] hallelujah we got something that'll hold
[1:36:58] us
[1:36:59] hey man
[1:37:00] but he wasn't fixed
[1:37:02] this reborn wasn't fixed
[1:37:05] and persevering and seeking the lord
[1:37:07] he grew proud because of all that he had
[1:37:10] [Applause]
[1:37:11] and he forsook the lord
[1:37:14] back and forth back and forth back and
[1:37:16] forth and he stripped the lord's house
[1:37:19] to buy up the kings of egypt
[1:37:22] and then he'd get stirred for a little
[1:37:24] bit
[1:37:25] but then but then he didn't persevere
[1:37:29] oh i wondered this morning how many of
[1:37:31] us get stirred every now and then oh
[1:37:33] brother tom whoever made me with a
[1:37:35] message and we get started we say god
[1:37:37] help us
[1:37:40] but we don't have no perseverance in us
[1:37:45] we don't prepare our hearts
[1:37:48] and therefore we get stirred for a
[1:37:50] little bit
[1:37:52] but then we don't persevere and see it
[1:37:53] through
[1:37:57] what we need to do
[1:37:59] we need to be we need to make
[1:38:00] preparation
[1:38:03] shoot my woman she made preparation
[1:38:06] told her husband said listen
[1:38:11] and maybe her husband didn't see it just
[1:38:12] like she'd seen it at the time
[1:38:14] but she said hey this man of god by the
[1:38:17] name of like he comes by hitch every now
[1:38:20] and then let's make him a little house a
[1:38:22] little room that he can come when he's
[1:38:23] weary on his journey
[1:38:25] he can lay down an arrest and
[1:38:27] we'll fix him something to eat he can be
[1:38:28] rest from this journey
[1:38:30] maybe at that time
[1:38:32] her husband didn't see it like that but
[1:38:33] she began to make preparation
[1:38:36] her heart was prepared
[1:38:38] and when that happened to her boy out
[1:38:40] there in the field that day working with
[1:38:41] his father
[1:38:43] and died
[1:38:45] she went to her husband said settle me
[1:38:47] ass
[1:38:49] get one servants to settle me an ass
[1:38:51] said i'm going to the man of god
[1:38:54] so why it's neither new moon or sabbath
[1:38:56] so you don't even know where he's at
[1:38:59] she said all is well
[1:39:01] why because her heart was prepared
[1:39:04] she made preparation because there's a
[1:39:06] time when he made that when he made a
[1:39:08] promise her she said don't deceive me
[1:39:11] because she even had a child all these
[1:39:13] years she said don't deceive me
[1:39:14] and then when she when that baby was
[1:39:16] finally born and then he died out there
[1:39:19] my brother said probably about 10 11
[1:39:20] years old working out in the field with
[1:39:22] the dead prey had a heat stroke
[1:39:24] she said i'm going it's neither new our
[1:39:26] husbands that's all right all is well
[1:39:29] back to the man of god
[1:39:32] amen and when the man of god he died you
[1:39:34] see her hey god's held it from me so
[1:39:36] there's a woman say i don't know what's
[1:39:37] wrong said i wonder if everything's all
[1:39:39] right so they said hey is everything all
[1:39:41] right with you is everything all is well
[1:39:43] hey man what
[1:39:45] preparation oh i hope today that we made
[1:39:48] preparation
[1:39:50] and we could
[1:39:51] say all is well
[1:39:53] all hell is breaking loose everything's
[1:39:55] going wrong but all is well
[1:39:59] all is well
[1:40:01] hallelujah
[1:40:10] number four

[1:40:16] but did jesus say you honor me with your
[1:40:18] lips but your heart's far from me
[1:40:21] i don't want to just come into the house
[1:40:23] of god or it may be
[1:40:26] it may be tomorrow i don't want to just
[1:40:27] honor him with my lips and my heart be
[1:40:29] far from him but i want my heart to be

[1:40:44] the bottle from the bottom of my soul
[1:40:46] praises unto thee lord
[1:40:49] he did not care whether he served the
[1:40:51] lord or not he just got to a place that
[1:40:54] he didn't care
[1:40:55] whether he served god or not whether he
[1:40:57] went to church or not oh i hope that we
[1:41:00] ain't in that place this morning that
[1:41:02] our hearts is not prepared and we don't
[1:41:04] care whether we serve the lord or not we
[1:41:06] don't care whether we come to the house
[1:41:08] of god or not
[1:41:11] see he didn't prepare his heart
[1:41:13] he wasn't made to service
[1:41:15] but he was just there
[1:41:18] see we could come this morning we could
[1:41:20] hear the singing we could hear brother

[1:53:56] sell it once and for all
[1:53:59] amen
[1:54:01] oh you may conduct
[1:54:04] your conduct
[1:54:05] may be so pious and everything and you
[1:54:08] know you may be that you you you your
[1:54:10] conduct may be okay you may be at the
[1:54:13] house of god you you might say hey well
[1:54:15] you know you're a message believer or
[1:54:18] i'm a christian because hey listen i got
[1:54:20] the books i got this and i got that and
[1:54:22] i go to a message church but that don't
[1:54:23] make me christian
[1:54:26] just because you say you believe in uh
[1:54:29] uh brother branham that don't make you a
[1:54:30] believer or a christian
[1:54:34] oh you say well look at my conduit look
[1:54:35] at all this and all this
[1:54:37] but you never prepared your heart
[1:54:42] you never prepared your heart to seek
[1:54:43] the lord
[1:54:46] what will you need to do we need to be
[1:54:47] born again
[1:54:51] i wonder do you try to serve god
[1:54:55] do i try to serve god do you try to
[1:54:57] serve god
[1:54:59] all like i said your conduct may be all
[1:55:00] right
[1:55:01] you may say yes ma'am and no ma'am
[1:55:04] you may be ever so pious
[1:55:06] but just because you come in this church
[1:55:08] don't make you a christian
[1:55:11] just because you pack a message book
[1:55:13] and a bible on your arm
[1:55:15] that don't make you a christian
[1:55:18] i wonder this morning
[1:55:21] do you even try to serve god
[1:55:25] have you prepared your heart did you
[1:55:27] prepare your heart before you came into
[1:55:29] the service this morning man
[1:55:32] maybe you knew your pastor was gonna be
[1:55:34] gone and you knew somebody was gonna be
[1:55:35] preaching instead of him
[1:55:38] he said well i wonder if i should go
[1:55:40] i wonder what he's got to say
[1:55:42] or did you prepare your heart say god i
[1:55:44] know brother tommy there but whoever you
[1:55:46] got
[1:55:48] lord would you speak to me through your
[1:55:50] word
[1:55:52] will you speak to me
[1:55:54] do you even try to serve god
[1:55:56] or is all of it on the outside
[1:56:00] it's just on the outside you dress right
[1:56:03] you walk right
[1:56:05] you may talk the message lingo
[1:56:07] you may have a bunch of christian
[1:56:10] cliches that you say
[1:56:14] but what about on the inside
[1:56:17] down on the inside of the inside
[1:56:22] and closing
[1:56:24] there's a preacher one time
[1:56:28] but before he was a preacher he's a
[1:56:29] little boy a little lad i forget how old
[1:56:31] he was
[1:56:32] and his dad always
[1:56:34] asked him
[1:56:35] or told him said man you ought to be
[1:56:37] like this other boy over here
[1:56:39] said look what he's doing he said look
[1:56:42] he's in church every sunday
[1:56:45] he's singing in the choir
[1:56:49] he's doing all this
[1:56:51] he said you need to be like him
[1:56:53] he said look he's even going to school
[1:56:56] trying to get a good education trying to
[1:56:57] make something out of his life
[1:57:02] and finally
[1:57:04] when that boy
[1:57:05] came back home
[1:57:09] and he'd seen him
[1:57:10] and he knew his dad always
[1:57:12] looked up to that boy said you ought to
[1:57:14] be like him
[1:57:16] but you know what
[1:57:17] when that boy got back into town
[1:57:20] he got around the wrong crowd
[1:57:24] and hanging around the wrong environment
[1:57:30] and he
[1:57:31] he even stole from the church
[1:57:37] and all these things
[1:57:39] and so that
[1:57:40] boy
[1:57:42] that man's son came to realize said you
[1:57:45] know what
[1:57:46] my dad always wanted to be
[1:57:49] like him
[1:57:50] look up to him the way he did the way he
[1:57:53] acted the way he went to church and just
[1:57:55] put on the act
[1:57:57] but his heart was never prepared
[1:58:00] and so when we got with the wrong crowd
[1:58:02] the wrong environment
[1:58:05] he lost it all
[1:58:07] and so he finally came to the conclusion
[1:58:09] said i don't want to be like anybody
[1:58:11] but i want to be like my heavenly father
[1:58:15] that's what i want to be like this
[1:58:16] morning
[1:58:18] i don't want to be like anybody
[1:58:20] i don't want to preach like anybody else
[1:58:23] i just want to be like him
[1:58:26] is that your prayer i stand this morning
[1:58:30] our hearts
[1:58:32] not prepared
[1:58:34] i hope they are this morning
[1:58:36] with our head bound our eyes closed
[1:58:41] wondered this morning
[1:58:43] maybe this was kind of different this
[1:58:45] morning
[1:58:48] the way that we brought it out but the
[1:58:50] lord knows
[1:58:52] if you're here this morning
[1:58:55] maybe you didn't come with your heart
[1:58:57] prepared this morning
[1:58:59] you thought you know what i'll just go
[1:59:02] and maybe
[1:59:03] you know i i i won't enter in and i
[1:59:05] won't do none of this but i'll just set
[1:59:08] back and maybe if he says something that
[1:59:10] it disturbed me or whatever no i just
[1:59:12] don't want to be stirred
[1:59:14] and not do nothing about it i don't want
[1:59:16] to just go through the motions or
[1:59:17] whatever
[1:59:19] but every service that i attend
[1:59:21] i want my heart to be
[1:59:23] prepared
[1:59:25] for what god has got for me
[1:59:28] and i don't want to be like anybody else
[1:59:30] but i want to be like him i want that
[1:59:32] your prayer this morning
[1:59:34] and god bless that hand that hand god
[1:59:37] sees that hand let's just pray
[1:59:39] heavenly father
[1:59:42] lord jesus we love you this morning
[1:59:45] and lord sometimes we come and our
[1:59:47] hearts are not prepared lord
[1:59:50] and therefore we don't receive anything
[1:59:53] and we walk out these doors and we
[1:59:54] wonder what was the matter with brother
[1:59:56] tom or brother david or or
[1:59:58] what was the matter with brother homer
[2:00:00] or something no maybe
[2:00:02] what was the matter what's up
[2:00:04] us
[2:00:05] that our hearts wasn't prepared
[2:00:07] and therefore we didn't get nothing from
[2:00:09] the service
[2:00:11] lord let us not be like that this
[2:00:12] morning but lord from this day on
[2:00:16] every service that we come to lord
[2:00:18] [Music]
[2:00:20] don't let the song leader let us not let
[2:00:21] the songwriter just sing
[2:00:23] but let us get behind him and worship
[2:00:26] you
[2:00:28] worship the lord with him
[2:00:30] may we not let the preacher just be
[2:00:33] preaching to the choir
[2:00:35] as they say
[2:00:37] but lord let your words speak to us
[2:00:40] because our hearts are prepared
[2:00:42] to receive from you lord
[2:00:44] [Music]
[2:00:46] they're prepared to seek your face lord
[2:00:50] and father don't matter

[2:01:08] that they attend
[2:01:09] [Music]
[2:01:11] and they may do all these things lord
[2:01:14] but father
[2:01:16] i want to be like you lord jesus
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:19] because you didn't call me to be like
[2:01:21] that person
