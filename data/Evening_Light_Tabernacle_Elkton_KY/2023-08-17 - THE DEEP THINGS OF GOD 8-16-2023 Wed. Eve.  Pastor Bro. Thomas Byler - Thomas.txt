bless the meditate us Lord to get out of the way now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen I want to continue on with bride food I don't know what part it is it doesn't really matter but amen we want to continue on just a little bit further I'm gonna move this down a little Micah so that I don't have that sound man um and I think amen we spoke came in quite a bit him on dying to ourself isn't that right amen and becoming dust so to speak perfect strength by Perfect fake weakness and then of course Rising amen letting God have his way in that right amen and so once you to be taught the little baby stuff anymore how to dress or better things amen great ER things praise the Lord amen and so that's what we want to do tonight amen and if you want to turn with me first Corinth Corinthians the second chapter amen is and I want to don't want to read five minutes worth of reading but it's two we accept uh save Jesus Christ and him crucified I was with you in weakness and in much fear and trembling and so forth and then we'll go down to verse six how be it how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak wisdom the wisdom of God in the mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory amen amen now which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard nor hath entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him but God has revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the Deep things of God Amen may God had his blessings to the reading of the word the Deep things of God the Deep things of God so by the help and grace of God tonight we're going to go deep I was thinking on the way here I said boy you're in trouble you got a shallow mind trying to go deep here amen blessed you know it's not about my mind anyway isn't that right it's about Christ amen and I'll express to you what I was kind of thinking in this so of course when we talk about the Deep things of God Amen uh you know I'm just going to share give me a different scriptures and different things and it'll probably seem like we're jumping into place but amen we are going to jump all over the place with the help of Lord because we know that God has some mysterious things that he had here amen before the before the world isn't that right amen but he has ordained it before the world unto our glory amen this will go along with brother Brad's message certainly on on Sunday I certainly enjoyed it amen I certainly enjoyed Sunday's message and this will certainly amen just go right along with going into the promised land how many believes we need to go into that Promised Land the promised land of the word of God and to eat on uh bride food we're eating and I was thinking of where that scripture was about eating all the good of the land eating the good of the land amen and I believe these deep things of God are eating on the good things of the land and of course and we'll just cover quite a quite a few different things amen uh with the help of the Lord on it but in Isaiah 1 18 it says um if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land amen praise the Lord how many is glad that we can uh eat those great big grapes that Joshua and those I don't know if it was Joshua but but it was I guess it was Joshua and Caleb but different ones that brought the uh grapes back amen amen from the land when they went to spy out the land and they brought these grapes back and I got to thinking of how big Those Grapes might have been maybe they were the size of a I mean uh maybe apple or something maybe even uh I don't know maybe they're as big as a grapefruit you know but I can just imagine that when you got into biting into one of them grapes you probably got your nose and your mouth all in it and my you just got your face all messy eating them grapes amen and that's what we want to do tonight I want you to just get all messy tonight and get to eat them good grapes amen because we don't want to be the two and a half amen they're just happy with salvation or being a part of Israel or whatever but hey man we want to go into all that God has for us I believe brother bam said one place if I found out that I inherited something you know and you mean I got a great big Warehouse or something here I'd want me or not I don't give me no forfeit ladder Now give me a eight foot or nine foot maybe 12 foot ladder you know because we're gonna go up there we're gonna get on them top shelves and we're gonna dig into there and find out what we inherited how many knows whenever you're talking about inheritance a lot of times you're talking about somebody Gotta Die before you get inherit anything amen praise the Lord how many knows Jesus Christ died for us and we become an heir of God join theirs with Christ amen so this is our inheritance praise be to God Amen so we want to eat with the help of the Lord on the good things of God under Amen on the good of the land praise be to God because I truly believe that that's what we are doing eating on the good things of God Amen but I thought about asking brother Danny well how are the services up there how how was it all because you know I don't have to ask because I watch them now I wasn't there and that had to be a multiple car I've seen you dancing [Laughter] praise the Lord that's all right up there just enjoying themselves amen had some good service Tommy knows amen but you know how many knows we've often said you know that that this shouldn't be the only place that we have a good time my my we're deprived children if that's the only place that we can have a good time in the Lord amen I believe we can have it on a Wednesday night anytime anywhere the Lord is it's always good praise be to God so now no this year it says and I want to finish this the Deep things of god notice the spirit searches all things yea the Deep things of God praise be to God so the spirit searches it begin to look at the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God praise be to God Amen I know you're never gonna gonna get any where unless first of all you get into the spirit amen you know all of us like different things some of us like golfing some of us like car racing some of us like to climb a tree and the clap and the ladder or in a clinch tree and sit there and get bug bit you know and wait for some deer to come under us you know it just not depends on what your preference is and you know we each have about as little interest on each other stuff sometimes because we're not in the same space amen because we all got the spirit of God and we want more of God so you gotta first of all we know that you first of all got to get in the spirit of it amen no matter what you're doing and now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God oh my friend Peter God what my I wasn't even thinking of this but isn't that kind of deep right there amen thinking that God was freely given to you amen all you had to do is believe my goodness that shouldn't be all that hard he's the one that's over he's the one that battled them demons he fought for it and then he bled he died he went to hell for you he rose again and he has freely given us all these things [Music] that sounds deep to me oh my which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with the spiritual thing for the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness foolishness under him neither can they know him because they are spiritually discerned how many notes to the world and you know don't have the spirit amen it seems like a bunch of foolish preaching it meant foods that seem fooling to them but to us is the most precious thing amen is the stuff that we love to do all day every day we love to hear the preaching of the word amen because it has the power of Salvation in the preaching of the word foolishness to them it's not fully says to us oh my God but he that is spiritual now notice for the natural man receiving not the things of the spirit of God for their Spirit foolishness unto them neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he man instruct them but we have the mind of Christ to think that you've got God's mind you've got his way of thinking for Jesus oh my praise be to God amen all right praise be to God not Ephesians if you want let's go to Ephesians if Ephesians 3 and 14. for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth Lord to be strengthened with them with the might by his spirit in the Inner Man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in your love may be able now notice now notice what he's talking about here this is scripture I want to get you may be able to comprehend with the Saints what is the width isn't that right the bread the breadth which is the width foreign the depth and the doubt and the Heights amen how high is that thing I want it amen that you may be able to comprehend and to know that which passes knowledge that you may be filled with the all the fullness of God not unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think according to the power that worketh in him so here again I just wanted to read that the talk was talking Paul was talking about how did he wants us to be able to comprehend what the depth of God is praise be to God amen because I want to know don't you it's something about and I was and I was looking at the internet amen just some of those things and and something come up where it had a saying I believe it was John Bunyan that he made a statement he made a statement he says you know whatever God says is best is best no matter if every man in the world disagrees with it or is against it and I thought that's right whatever God says is best is best when I think about how that God has given us away and when you know and when you can comprehend that way because let me tell you life is full of darkness and mystery and uh and confusion and when you have what God has said when you have comprehension of God and his word and what his will is and what the true right way is you're a blessed person I don't know about you but I want to be able to comprehend it don't you amen praise the Lord I want to comprehend what the width the height the depth of God is praise be to God understanding one of the things that we've learned is the Way Up Is Down never right God's strength is ever again deeper unless you come to the death of yourself until you come on come all the way down and then you're ready to come back up so that's the amen then God can use you I believe that God can use you to slay Giants and not just Giants but armies amen praise be to God oh my amen we're gonna pick pick I'm thinking and I'm wanting to say things that's down in the list on my on my notes here but amen and it doesn't mind matter if it's one giant it doesn't matter if it's 600 Philistines it means it don't matter if it's a thousand it doesn't matter if it's a whole Army of Egypt Moses with a stick in God went down and took over that's the yeah that's deep amen praise the Lord not a thought let me first of all start with the thought that I kind of had when I thought about the Deep things of God I I had this this thought first of of the um what do you call it the satisfaction or the contentment that a Christian has in Walking with God the contentment that you can feel Walking with God on a daily basis and I want to emphasize this tonight amen and I want to kind of bring this and it just pops into my mind how many knows everything you think has to be in weighed with the word but this is what what what coming to my heart and mind this week and what brought me to this message is what else can we ask for what more do you want what more do we want because how many knows we're never happy with what we have huh amen I'll tell you what we have a house we have a this out of the other my little house out there we have and so forth but do you realize how nice it is for me to go out there on that front porch and sit on that white rocker and drink my coffee every morning and enjoy no I'm at the biggest place and not by no means I got the fancy play but I enjoy what God gave me I'm intent with what I got gay man that's kind of how it was gone and people would just enjoy what God gave them they wouldn't be some discontent it wouldn't be so unhappy foreign God give us godliness with contentment that's deep why because we as human beings we always want we're too busy trying to better ourselves and we never get a chance to enjoy what God has already given us so chill and enjoy what God gave you quit stressing yourself out over more when you've already got all you need oh I don't have enough you got food you got arraignment you got a roof over your head Paul's head you're having food and Raymond we can do it well I'm a happy man Glory because you know what God hates somebody that's discontent I don't know about you but I don't like this contentment to myself God hates his contentment because the devil was right up there with God and he was discontent he was dissatisfied and you know what better man said about the world is filled with this side of five people but we as Christians look at Paul what he says but I speak in respect of one for I have learned and whatsoever State I am there with to be content how to be amazed I know everywhere I can do all things and everywhere I'm instructable to be full and to be hungry to abound and to suffer need but he says I know there's one thing that whatsoever said I am there with I am God can you be so happy Paul why why you're in prison you're involved because you've been taken care of your future is secured you have a God that's leading you have a garden that's guiding you you have a God that's comforting you you've got the god in creation you are you ain't got nothing to worry about [Applause] that's deep amen oh yeah well maybe talk about it yet but the fact that we know that your name was written before the sun was made before the Earth was made before this ball was made your name your name foundation of the world way back into the back part of God's mind you know what the prophet said we're understanding the back part again just the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ what was in the back of his mind before he started making the first star before I hung the first star moon who was in his mind I was in his mind that's why I'm here that's why you're here that day being deep I don't know what is we have the mind of Christ praise the Lord Hallelujah Hallelujah first one I thought back to my thought second Corinthians 5. foreign Corinthians 5 verse 17 therefore If any man be in Christ here's a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are new amen aren't you glad for that now I'm gonna stop right there just I'm sorry but we're going to come up the stop sign right there before we go on I'm gonna pick up what comes up into my mind because I want to do this Tower to you first but how many believes that we're in the Promised Land the promised land of the Holy Ghost that's the Holy Ghost it's the promised land and I like what this second Peter 1 and 4 says whereby are given unto us succeeding great and precious promises amen how many believes that we have great precious promises amen now notice so he says the old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and it's given but us the ministry of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing us trespasses upon them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ though as God did beseech You by us we pray you instead be reconciled amen it was a book of what a book of redemption a book of reconcilia should have hearted God and man was going to be reconciled again a man to think that we've been wrecking some I mean reason you have been reconciled yeah I'll tell you something deep amen when you think about the prophet of God saying that we are everywhere every state except this physical body we have been reconciled in the same spot in place that Adam was before the fall say that it's Mountain be moved and it'll be moved all things are possible to you when you reconciled that was deep just a simple message of reconciliation of God reconciling with man you and him becoming one again praise be to God aren't you glad after that oh my be reconciled to God for he have made us to be sin he hath made him to be sin for us who knew knows him that he might be made that we might be made the righteousness of God in him remember the church age book whether bam explained he said you know that when the what the blood washes us when we get clean that we become the very righteousness of God wow that you're just as right as his God is righteous you're just as holy as God is Holy daddy deep I don't know what it is the very righteousness of God why because you ain't gonna sit by him and be all dirty huh You're Gonna Be have to be righteous like he is you're going to live with him amen we say are we're gonna I'm gonna believe we already are you live with him every day I hope so amen oh my pray to you I thought reconciliation that's what it's all about amen Colossians no Galatians 2 20. Galatians 2 20 is another one and then notice how Paul says here I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me how many believe that and the life that I now live I live that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Colossians 1 and verse 20 says 26 it says even the ministry which has been hid from ages and from three Generations but now it's made manifest to his Saints how many knows to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory I mean everybody Baptist Christ the mystery you know somebody talking about Christ was the mystery and if Christ in his you he says then that makes you the ministry that was in God's mind before the foundation of the world people don't realize that they're walking especially their sisters or brothers away regressing do we have they don't realize that they're looking at the very mystery of almighty God that he had before the foundation of the world he would be in a union that would be Christ amen fight in the world that's the great mystery I don't know about you but I like Mysteries don't you mystery books you like a mystery book this is the greatest mystery book of all but the great mystery is what the great mystery Paul said that's been hid from ages which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen I don't know anything deeper than God in you living his own life out amen praise be to God let's look at a few more things shall we let's look at faith hope and love amen and I want to touch on this Faith a little bit because how many knows that faith is deep one of the things that God is that God grants to us is Faith it's deep we know that faith is a revelation that's given to you isn't that right of God revealing himself to you personally amen Faith Like Joshua faith that God had let's go back further we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God faith in what he said and that the very faith that God said amen and there Joshua one day until God and man it was so one back there Joshua was so yielded to the plan of God that he could speak to the son and that's deep can you imagine how many scientists would disagree with you and would fuss and fight with you knives it couldn't have been everybody flew off if the sun stopped the moon stopped in the valley of whatever lawn I thought well I don't know what aggalon is probably yeah I go probably and it's kind of like Death Valley in a certain Valley maybe he was maybe Joshua's looking setting into certain Valley he says hold still Moon you stand Sun stand still where you're at God heard him stop the whole thing that's what faith will do Red Sea parted the walls come up faith is an hour for the other moves amen by faith are you saved by grace that not of yourselves Paul said the way that I live I live by the face of the Son of God I believe that's where you ought to live that's where I don't live that's our very driving force is the faith of almighty God in a person praise be to God amen the Reapers know and all about that Faith don't you God opening red season can't get over it and can't get under it and God takes you through just commit your case to the Lord if he can't handle it guess what no doctor can't either but when you trust the Lord in that watch God work yeah yeah man I actually glad to say like that Hallelujah God gives us faith go just down the road that in the side but I begin to think about Roe rope as I was driving down the road because in First Corinthians 13 chapter now abiding face hope and love isn't that right faith hope and love and I said well faith I know it's powerful it's so powerful it'll bring Giants and it'll slay Giants it'll kill all armies we're living by faith I'll tell you what you can be down in advance you can feel like they're just piles of demons on you and you can just say Dad let's get off of me let's watch him play everywhere they can't stop you better benefits when you've got a personal experience with God there's not enough devils in hell to stop you I want you to know there's a bunch of them or Son of God if he's got faith amen you'll fling every one of them off of you they'll get tired of fighting you and run off into the into the darkness back where they come from that's right they'll try to depress you try to make you hopeless but you know I thought what about hope what does Hope do well we know that one of the things that would keep anybody going if you were imprisoned if you or whatever your situation you're if you're in a hopeless situation the only thing that'll keep you going is Hope is that right and I thought you know it'd be like a prisoner like a prisoner in bars he said well I'm just going to spend the rest of my life behind bars but do you know of all the people that have escaped prison huh have you all heard of all the stories oh Alcatraz nobody can ever escape there but yet I heard it did huh why it doesn't matter how tight you are confined if you have hope you find a way out you figured out but now if you don't have hope you'll sit there and rot once you lose hope you'll just sit there hey man you got a chance in the world you know but that guy that wants to get out of there guess what he's gonna look alive he's gonna watch what that little guy does what time he does what time that door opens he's gonna do this out of the other he's going to survey when he goes out into into the playground playground he can look at the walls and where this wall is where that wall is how many walls do I get to get through to get out he'll be conniving hello because he's got hope that he's going to get out that's why they escape that's what hope does amen aren't you glad that we have hope we're gonna get out of here one of these days we ain't satisfied here this ain't got all of it praise be to God all right faith and Hope praise be to God how about love how many knows love is the deepest thought there ain't nothing deeper love the love of God is greater for our pen can tell he reaches beyond the highest star and reaches down to the lowest Health it can save the lowest Center it can oh it doesn't matter a prostitute or a woman that's at five husbands or the most terriblest people forgive because of the love of almighty God nothing beats nothing's deeper than the love of my of God then you ought to be willing to forgive your brother to 590 times a day or is it 490 490 times 490 times a day that's how powerful it is that's how deep it is amen amen amen oh my the love of God drove God to do what he did huh God didn't sit up there and say well I'll tell you what I look look forward to frying some folks in hell no huh that's not what his motive was his motive was to give everybody a chance he was he was so full of love brother Glenn that even every sinner has to jump over his barricades to get the hell if you want to go to hell you got to go jump some barricades you gotta crash through some barricades you gotta crash through that energy inside that knows better they aren't that down they know better God put that better in them but they just jump off of that they ignore that that's why some people don't have a conscience they've seared it too much amen you gotta go past the word of God they got to go past their conscience they gotta go oh my they just gotta turn their head from the Sun they gotta turn their ignorance they gotta be ignorant to the power of the universe and how it works and that's God I want to be evil they have to turn God away God Did It All Because Of Love amen yes he did praise the Lord all because of Love is what he did it for clean the vile a sinner Paul said I'm the chief of them isn't that right the chief of sinners God Saves praise be to God amen you know what else is deep something else that's deep and that's the sound of an elk the sound of a wolf huh I thought about this you need to know the sound I don't know if you all know the sound of elk but the time he's gonna have to know what the sound of an elk is here after a while I'm gonna go on now I couldn't Screech and I thought about bringing my big scripture up here by the time but I just couldn't get myself to do it I've got a elk call well something like that anyway you know the weird part you want to hear a cow want to hear cow something like that welcome but brother Graham said he was out there isn't that right he heard that help call him hear the cow he won here coyote or some a wolf called way over there and way over on the other side it's me calling back to him oh man he's at the Deep he's calling to the Deep let me tell you something while the person gets out on their knees this is what I meant oh God there's a deep here at the name over there to respond and then when you need whatever you call on God it's going to jail be giving it to you our relationship with God that's what I'm talking about is deep that's why we pray God God help us to pray in the morning how was the brand new help us to talk to our mate oh it's a deep calling imagine if you wanted to serve God if you wanted to do what's right but there was no way huh I'm telling you what right now but you talk about the Deep calling to the Deep God knew that we'd be having 900 different churches a bunch of different religions and we want to do what's right we don't know which one to do that's why he wrote behold I'll send you Elijah to the prophet before the great and breath of me he put in Malachi 4 for you he put in Malachi 4 for me and when he yelled but when he's cleaned when he spoke amen it was unrebound there's something about that sound it's a voice that you hear and he called to you call to me and we responded my sheep hear my voice and another state won't follow that's deep amen the fact that we know what happened plumbed back in the Garden of Eden isn't that right the whole plan understand it that's deep amen praise the Lord don't you just love this come on folks now I'm gonna have to get a little more come on better but yeah Amen brother Fred said that when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost everything You'll Ever Need I want this I want that don't worry it's already in you and it's right there it'll happen don't worry don't fret it's in you that everything you'll ever need is in you when you got the Holy Ghost that's deep when you come to the door of death you have what you need praise the Lord all right let me go to another scripture I won't be able to get through this before midnight I don't get going Romans turn to Romans with me [Applause] I wrote on one of these stickers here get into service with me participate in this with me amen God called you to be born he chose you to live if you give you a new birth he put you in the body of Christ he puts you in here to be a participator not a spectator how many wants to be a participator amen I was going to say this whenever uh and I may still say that but I'll say it now brother Andrew Glover come Saturday guess what your amens better be quick because Andrew Glover as far as I am concerned is the fastest preacher I've ever seen brother he can spit this corn out like it's shallon he can spit it out fast and it's good and it's word and I'm like wow he really studies his word so you better be ready to eat fast amen praise the Lord all right Romans 1 day and 28. and I'm for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose I mean that's a precious scripture right there that's deep right right for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover who he did predestinate damn he also called and whom he called damn he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified half half already brother bam says that's why he already he justified you Sanctified he filled with the Holy Ghost guess what he's already glorified you he's already got you a glorified body over on the other side amen now what shall we say then to do things if God before us who can be against us oh man Oh I thought about that I said praise be to God if God is in there don't worry about nobody don't worry about nothing then who can be against us oh my God praise the Lord I'm not sure how did I read write write this down before us I don't care who's against us I don't care whose is also I wrote I hate to be the one that is against you if evening light Tabernacle is a Church of God I pity the person that's against it I pitied a person that's against it when I got to thinking about this as I felt I said I'm going to tell the church I love this church I love you being like Tabernacle but I love the saints that are in it more if we believe we're in the divine order we're the Church of God I love it I love being in the church that God is I love we dream with God's people if God is for us I don't really care what Minister don't like us don't want us rights is off what person rights is off because there's a lot of people I have uh they ain't no Church of God go ahead see if I care I don't really care there's one thing I know that if God is all I want to know is is God for us if you want to be against us that's fine just I don't really care I pity you because you can actually fighting against God and don't know it I mean he loves their dirt that's right you ought to love your church people so dissatisfied Oh I wanna I wanna go to a better Church well see if it is better when you get there we'll be about the same condition that you left down at the other Church changing churches doesn't change your change change a little bit amen amen just crazy thoughts going through my hand is that all right but I still think it's deep don't you I don't want to be on the wrong side I don't want to be against anybody that is for God and anywhere where God is for you I don't want to be against that do you if God is for us who can be against us amen he that spared not his own son delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also once again is that word freely give us all thanks who shall lay anything to the charge of God it is God that justifieth amen praise be to God who is he that condemneth it's Christ that died amen is risen again who is even at the right hand of God and making intercessions for us now on this next part I want you to participate a little bit would that be all right after each one of these things I want you to say nothing amen nothing or no let's go with nothing who shall separate us from the love of God shall tribulation let's go with no shall they stress shall persecution [Applause] thank goodness shall soar they can chop our head off furnace and to say do what you want you'll never separate us from God we're so deep in God ain't nothing's ever going to pull us off of it you don't you think that the love of God is in your heart and it's the love of God oh my god listen to me I don't know why brother Joe but sometimes it feels like God puts each person he'll make you feel like you are all alone sometime in your walk it could easily happen where you feel like there's you're all alone but you know what he brings us to that place to where he doesn't matter if you're all alone you will walk your walk is to be alone with God it's not if everybody treats you right and everybody loves you and everybody's doing good for you then you'll love God no you got nothing to do with it it's persecution is separation if you're all by yourself that's that's God and nothing's gonna separate me from the love of God Jesus said if you love wife nor husband more than me you're not worthy of me is that you and your wife or your husband or your land or your disorder the other it's you and God Glory arching man brothers and sisters that this world Amen is on sinking sand this world's going down but there's a rock the rock that you have landed on Amen the wise man built his house on the rock when the winds blowing when the swords come amen the devil blow as hard as he wants all it does is make me stronger oh my well I'm not sure what I call it here a few Services go the more the devil blows the strong you get it's kind of productive the devil's is blowing and he's hissing in the trials that come your way and then it's counterproductive I don't care how much Leo this tear no matter what the devil throws at us the trial of your faith being much more precious than a gold [Applause] deep the trial that you go through it is what dresses you it's what molds you it's the very gold it's the character picture that you're going to take with you amen that's deep like Peter said and I wanted to bring that in the other Deep thing is those trials that we go through they're more precious in Gold than perishes because it's what makes you and what molds you it's what teaches to go on our knees we can't do nothing else we can't get over it you can't get around to hey but he can take you through and none I'm too bad to have that kind of goal remember laodice said this lukewarm when I was sitting in this I thought man this is the age of people or nothing but muck I believe the prophet of God said there's just people would just become muck laughs just a big old jellyfish there's just nothing there but in the midst of all that he's gonna have a people without spout without wrinkle and then they're on a rock oh another they're in the image of Christ they're not mocked in the image of Christ in the middle of it all in the middle of this worst age as ever when people don't know which side they belong they don't if they're a man or a woman huh uh I think Brad was saying something about you can't expect I'm not thinking it was him something about you can't expect a 12 year old child to make a decision the kind of decisions they make isn't that right they're not wise enough to and I thought you know what a 12 year old can't either but be Senators that are 80 years old they gotta lick a sense either they aren't able to make any choices either right because they're the ones they're trying to confuse him in the first they're worse than a 12 year old right most 12 year olds could probably tell them hey you bunch of you guys are your little ignoramus here amen that's right I apologize all of them are brainless yeah I don't mind brainless completely lost their brain completely lost their mind the prophet said he's called completely going sane Insanity you are insane and I'm not putting you in the insane institution because you're already in it this whole world is an insane Institution and in the midst of the insane institution we got a few of them going around trying to keep some sanity amen that's God's church and when those are gone it's time to get rid of it all amen praise the Lord oh aren't you glad God Moses and shakes us those trials that come your way the Deep part of those is it's kind of productive when the wind blows what does it do that tree stretches its roots root stretch almost both empty goes deeper next time goes deeper goes deeper I love a tree that's planted by the water amen where it can go way deep but it can go way out doing the wind coming kept going on you and I have been planted by the rivers of water you can let your roots go away in here Oh I thought about personal revelation folks we need personal revelation more than anything else in the world while it's a rock that'll keep you Amen in in scripture and all other ground is sinking sand ain't it oh crap it's a solid rock I Stand All on the ground is exactly quicksand and it's going down but we're building a house on a rock Amen on a personal revelation of almighty God somebody believes it we have to realize more what we are and Who We Are God's children humbly amen all right we got five minutes can I go more just say no praise the Lord now we realize let me go on listen we're not done yet as it is written we are killed all the day long we are counted as she best for the slaughter need all these things we are did I miss something all these things we are conquerors that's what I wanted to hear no we're more that's deeper right oh we're more than conquerors we're through him that loved us we could just run and jump and shouting huh to figure more than a conqueror he conquered for you and he give you the victory and they do to make three Oh I thought about that a while ago I thought you know when you become a Christian when you come dead to yourself then you're ready to slay Giants no no what it means is if you have actually whipped yourself and you actually come to the death of yourself that means that you have already whipped the Giant you've already quit the biggest giant you'll ever win that is yourself oh we all know that mind of ours that heart of mind to live flesh of this flesh hey man you better you if you you know you got to overcome that thing isn't that right you can overcome that and whip that you've done it brother bam said what's the greatest enemy he had himself so if you win that you're not tell the giant you're ready or something bigger than Giants now you're ready for armies oh man brother Tommy we talk about Samson we talk about uh shamgar we talk about these guys the same God is in you you have many Devils a lot of times that you have to fight at one time hello oh man I just love to take the thing I just love to take the shield of faith comes one at you I thought comments or whatever Here Comes The Devil and go you just ricochets off here comes another one another one Ricochet off yeah praise God and then here comes the thought just throw it out they made a shield of faith will quench every fiery that the wicked one throws at you I'm just gonna be sad and blue I'm gonna be down today hello you must have put this to the side somewhere opens yourself up yeah no we're more than conquerors the Deep things of God the Deep things of God amen no no do you think we are more in Congress for him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death and death separate us can life separate us and Angels separate us what about these principalities what about powers what about things present what about things to come what about hype dance amen it shall not be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus all right let's see [Applause] that's the Deep thing to God now I think you'll be able to separate not things to come no present only honest your riches is gonna separate me from the love of God no big money a bunch of money in a big business and making a bunch of money they bet that ain't gonna separate read the pride of Christ Luke lukewarmness isn't going to separate you people getting called on God isn't going to separate people couldn't Church ain't gonna separate you not they're gonna separate you everybody say nothing shall separate us stand with me hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah God is good isn't he I don't know about you but that's the good of the land for from where I'm standing brother
