[26:47] Brian
[27:05] is there said
[27:09] um for sheltered for me in a strong
[27:13] tower from the enemy so the word of God
[27:16] that's your strong tower the presence of
[27:19] that's your strong tower I know in our
[27:21] age it's when you read something like
[27:24] that go back a thousand years or 500
[27:27] years into a different time in a
[27:29] different age where if you were a
[27:32] society a strong tower or you didn't
[27:34] have an aous area that you could defend
[27:37] yourself when the enemy came everything
[27:40] that you worked stolen by another people
[27:43] and it's no different for us this
[27:45] morning our Strong Tower is the word of
[27:47] God and the presence of Jesus Christ and
[27:50] that's what you fory yourself beond
[27:53] morning no matter what your
[27:54] circumstances are out there this morning
[27:57] I'm just one man I don't know what where
[27:59] each person is sitting here this morning
[28:01] I don't know where you're
[28:03] at but Jesus Christ does and I know that
[28:07] the word of God is just as powerful this
[28:13] morning and it's just Faith you have to
[28:16] have faith in the word of God and
[28:19] presence that of Christ that's been
[28:20] given to you this morning anything
[28:22] outside of that you'll be in and you'll
[28:24] be out you'll be up and down but if
[28:26] you're if you're Rock
[28:28] is in the word of God and the presence
[28:30] of Jesus Christ and there's nothing to
[28:33] be afraid of in this world that we live
[28:35] this morning and I'm already off morning
[28:38] as some of you know already I uh turn
[28:40] the heat on this week so the uh the me
[28:44] are spinning for the next couple of
[28:45] months uh with me to I'm trying to
[28:49] decide where to go
[28:52] this which direction to
[28:54] go but you know people have been praying
[28:57] and we in the back room you know I'm six
[29:01] I'm past that point I'm not a young man
[29:03] no more but brother Glenn knows when I
[29:06] was on active duty when you when you
[29:08] want to live a Christian Life want to
[29:11] set an example to the people or the men
[29:13] around you that life to lead is not an
[29:16] easy life especially when you're alone
[29:18] and by yourself and you have to be
[29:21] willing no matter what people think
[29:22] about you whatever the circumstances are
[29:25] you just have to move out in faith and
[29:28] whether you talk you you know just like
[29:33] the brother Joe how it became a
[29:36] Christian it almost separated me
[29:40] completely experience you know being
[29:42] raised as a Catholic boy when I accepted
[29:46] Christ as my savior when I went back to
[29:49] my family I can they didn't receive it
[29:52] very well even my parents didn't receive
[29:54] it well but you have to put people you
[29:58] care about people but your whole desire
[30:01] your whole purpose in life is to walk
[30:03] the path that Christ morning and I'm
[30:06] trying to find a place to start this
[30:08] morning some of you might be laughing
[30:10] about that but uh let's go to
[30:15] Philippians um fourth
[30:18] chapter I wrote I was listening to some
[30:21] messages this
[30:23] morning uh let me find where I have
[30:25] these not at this morning but this is
[30:29] this goes to Philippians the 4th chapter
[30:32] you know if there's any chapter there's
[30:36] numerous chapters I could say you can't
[30:39] read enough in a day you know one of
[30:41] them for me would be Corinthians the 5th
[30:44] chapter and Philippians the third and
[30:47] fourth chapter if you need encouragement
[30:50] those would be the chap to read this
[30:52] morning but I kind of in um this is from
[30:56] the homepage
[30:58] on recing and I this is a a the quote
[31:03] and uh some of you know where I'm going
[31:06] some of you
[31:08] probably uh it really speaks to the age
[31:12] that we live in uh I'll just read it
[31:14] it's from blind bear uh mys again are
[31:18] all messed up as I get I can't even
[31:20] pronounce that but I'll just read what
[31:22] brother brandham had to
[31:24] say it and this goes back to another
[31:27] quote I have I carry
[31:29] around it's right Philippian this quote
[31:32] from the uh healing thoughts book and
[31:35] the premise of it same no matter what
[31:38] and he goes on to say
[31:40] here these things that are positive and
[31:43] that's really important for an if you're
[31:46] one of those people that see everyone is
[31:50] different if you're don't want to be the
[31:52] person a negative in everything we do
[31:56] you know that that that you hear people
[31:58] speak there's a guy that always
[32:01] looks half dampy and the other guy that
[32:03] looks at a glass as half full we want to
[32:06] be the one or I want to be the one to
[32:08] look situation as being on a
[32:13] positive s what brother random had the S
[32:17] think on these things that are positive
[32:20] never let a negative pass
[32:22] through just don't let it stop anyhow so
[32:27] every day his goal is to get you to be
[32:30] thinking on stuff that has no meaning
[32:33] that has a
[32:34] negative connotations to it he's trying
[32:38] to push you away from being positive and
[32:40] keep your positive and on what the good
[32:44] way to positive thoughts this morning is
[32:47] always putting your mind on Christ on
[32:49] Jesus Christ this morning if you're
[32:50] thinking about him you won't be negative
[32:53] you can't be negative and think about
[32:55] Jesus Christ it's impossible it's a it's
[32:57] a positive thing you can't be negative
[33:00] if you put your hope in that this
[33:02] morning and he goes on to say don't
[33:04] think heing a don't think sitting here
[33:07] in a wheelchair you or helpless you're
[33:10] not don't let the negative thought ever
[33:13] pass though or don't you can't help from
[33:16] going through your mind that's right
[33:19] don't let it
[33:20] stop and he goes on and say you all know
[33:23] where this last
[33:25] you've um brother Glover whoever was
[33:28] talking brother Thomas was
[33:30] talk to say like the old farmer said I
[33:34] can't keep from flying over my place
[33:36] everyone know you can't keep the birds
[33:39] over your mind constantly your enemy is
[33:41] going to try to put
[33:44] those say here but he had a double
[33:47] barrel shotgun and I can I can sure keep
[33:50] them from roosting so you so you you too
[33:54] see don't let them Roost don't let them
[33:57] pass right on gone through and I you
[34:00] know in life it's easy to say a thing
[34:04] it's hard to do a thing and that's what
[34:07] you have to do you have to do the thing
[34:09] you have to not allow those evil
[34:11] thoughts or those bad thoughts to
[34:13] possess your mind or heart and I'll just
[34:16] um I want to read this fourth chapter I
[34:19] say that and
[34:21] I and uh but it goes on to
[34:28] I just wrote some notes I was listening
[34:30] to another message this morning before I
[34:33] read that
[34:35] chapter other thing iom say this morning
[34:39] is that your healing and your blessings
[34:43] aren't really are based faith not on
[34:45] your salvation there are things you
[34:47] reach out in faith
[34:50] believing going to do those things for
[34:53] you and you have to have your your mind
[34:55] has to be stable it has to be reaching
[34:58] out the presence of Jesus Christ and for
[35:00] those things this morning and back to
[35:03] this chapter here this
[35:07] morning I'll just read here in the
[35:09] fourth chapter of uh it says therefore
[35:13] my brethren dearly beloved and long for
[35:16] my and Crown so stand the Lord my
[35:21] beloved so he's telling his and Tion are
[35:25] going to be brutal again this morning

[35:33] s mind in the Lord and I entreat thee
[35:37] also true yoke fellow help those women
[35:41] with me in the gospel with clment also
[35:44] and with the other my fellow laborers
[35:46] who in The Book of Life we're no
[35:49] different we all are working to a
[35:51] purpose here this morning on to say
[35:54] rejoice in the lord always and I again
[35:56] to say rejoice so no matter what
[35:59] the you have you can rejoice in the word
[36:03] of God and in the in Jesus Christ this
[36:06] morning don't me take away your joy this
[36:08] morning if you doesn't getting out there
[36:12] in the world to be full of people that
[36:14] have no joy and what's funny about it
[36:16] they're G to do everything they can to
[36:18] take your joy away from you and he goes
[36:20] on I entreat thee also trth I've read
[36:23] that
[36:24] already as always and again I say
[36:27] rejoice let your moderation be known
[36:28] unto all men the
[36:31] Lord be careful for nothing but in
[36:33] everything by prayer and supplication
[36:35] with Thanksgiving let your requests be
[36:39] known that goes with what was said this
[36:42] morning so far and the peace of God all
[36:46] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[36:48] Minds through Christ Jesus finally and
[36:52] this this scripture this eth verse here
[36:55] enough
[37:00] are true and whatsoever things are
[37:03] honest and what just whatsoever thing
[37:07] are pure and whatsoever thing are lovely
[37:10] whatsoever things are good report if
[37:13] there be any virtue and if there be any
[37:16] praise think on these things and these
[37:19] are the things that to think on every
[37:22] day
[37:25] not and he goes on to say these things
[37:28] which you have both learned and received
[37:30] and heard and seen in me do and the God
[37:33] of Peace shall be with you and I'll just
[37:35] finish I don't I was about to say
[37:38] something I'm not going to say it but I
[37:40] was just thinking this morning of our
[37:44] circumstances before I I'm just this
[37:53] is I've got I was just I was reading a
[37:59] a man that wrote a study long ago and it
[38:04] kind of speaks to this what I was
[38:06] thinking about this morning in the age
[38:08] that we live in where we're at right now
[38:12] you know you hear ministers tell
[38:14] you one thing in church and another
[38:18] thing when you get to work those days
[38:19] are over with the days of playing around
[38:21] with the Gospel of Jesus Christ are over
[38:24] with now I could say something like that
[38:26] but does it really have any meaning I
[38:29] can only speak for myself does it have
[38:31] any meaning for me in my life and as I
[38:34] get older I realize all the things that
[38:38] I but I'll just I'll just read this I
[38:41] read this a lot here this is out of that
[38:44] healing thoughts book but I really don't
[38:47] have a lot else to say without getting
[38:49] probably getting in trouble this morning
[38:50] but I'll just finish this and I read I
[38:54] read this a lot when I'm by myself and
[38:57] my stuff study in the a lot I read this
[38:59] that's why I keep it in my Bible and
[39:01] this comes out of spiritual adoption you
[39:04] all have read this before but I'll read
[39:07] it again and finish with that this
[39:10] morning and we all know brother random
[39:12] said in order to stay with God stay
[39:14] gentle and that's re really important
[39:17] and I know in my own life as I get older
[39:20] it's you need to stay gentle you can't
[39:22] let the circumstances of Life make angry
[39:26] or frustrated and I know sometimes I
[39:29] don't live up to that but he goes on to
[39:31] say God is
[39:32] gentle stay with God stay with love God
[39:35] is love stay Meek don't ever be
[39:39] self-sufficient I got to raise my hand
[39:41] there I that's thing I have to work on I
[39:44] try to do things myself instead of
[39:46] letting God do them don't ever be
[39:48] self-sufficient always rely upon him
[39:51] never use your own mind take his
[39:53] thoughts and that goes back to what I
[39:55] was reading this morning of very
[39:57] thoughts have to be possessed with the
[39:59] word of God this morning those are his
[40:01] thoughts this morning when you read the
[40:03] word of God that's the very thought of
[40:05] God expressed to us as human beings this
[40:08] morning take them into your carnal mind
[40:10] and repeat them over and over say oh God
[40:13] take away all my doubt away and let my
[40:15] thoughts be your thoughts and I know
[40:18] that's something I have to do every day
[40:20] put you know when I get so caught up
[40:22] with the circumstance I have to go and
[40:25] be quiet enough to let the the word of
[40:27] God have its effect in my own life and
[40:30] he says just to Cast Away the thoughts
[40:32] of sickness takes God healing let them
[40:35] become your thoughts think on these
[40:37] things and it's not just healing if
[40:39] you're having family problems if you're
[40:42] having financial problems whatever those
[40:44] problems it's not just healing problems
[40:47] if you put your mind to it and you just
[40:49] surrender to God and let him take
[40:51] control of the circumstances I know I
[40:54] know in my own I've seen it he's more
[40:56] than able to bring about whatever you
[40:59] desire this morning so if Brother David

[1:19:42] any bowels of mercies fulfill ye my joy
[1:19:45] that you be like my having the same love
[1:19:49] being of one Accord of one mind let
[1:19:53] nothing be done through Strife or Glory
[1:19:55] but in liness of Mind Let each esteem
[1:19:58] other
[1:20:03] better amen better than them look not
[1:20:07] every man on his own things but every
[1:20:09] man also on the things of others let
[1:20:11] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:20:15] Christ Jesus Amen in First Corinthians 2
[1:20:19] 1 Corinthians 2
[1:20:27] amen remember how I spoke of how uh
[1:20:31] through
[1:20:32] Luther uh it was typed that through
[1:20:35] Luther Luther it was a restoration amen
[1:20:39] of the fullness of Christ coming back to
[1:20:41] church a't that right and he was
[1:20:43] represented as walking by faith the just
[1:20:45] shall walk by
[1:20:47] faith Wesley was the chest and so forth
[1:20:51] amen up in here with sanctification of
[1:20:53] the spirit and so forth and then
[1:20:55] Pentecost was of course uh to speaking
[1:20:57] in tongues a't that right you were like
[1:20:59] up here amen and then our Prophet was to
[1:21:02] seeing he was the Seer he could look uh
[1:21:05] you know God would show him visions and
[1:21:08] he could tell the thoughts and intents
[1:21:10] of people's heart ain't that right amen
[1:21:12] and then of course faculty above that is
[1:21:15] of course your mind amen so we're in the
[1:21:18] mind age and we want to talk about the
[1:21:19] mind of Christ with the help of the Lord
[1:21:22] for a little while this morning would
[1:21:23] that be okay so 1 Corinthians 2 and
[1:21:27] verse4 it says but the natural man
[1:21:30] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:21:32] of God for there are foolishness unto
[1:21:35] him neither can he know them because
[1:21:37] they are spiritually discerned but he
[1:21:39] that is spiritual judges all things yet
[1:21:42] he himself is judged of no man for who
[1:21:45] ha known the mind of the Lord that he
[1:21:48] may instruct him but we have the mind of
[1:21:55] Christ amen Give the Lord a hand thank
[1:21:58] you Lord that we can have your mind amen
[1:22:02] how many wants to think his
[1:22:04] thoughts amen you got to think his
[1:22:06] thoughts confession amen if Thou shalt
[1:22:08] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:22:10] Christ Thou shalt be saved you got to
[1:22:12] say what he said amen because it's the
[1:22:15] enemy that wants us to think our
[1:22:17] thoughts amen or his thoughts and that's
[1:22:20] sometimes much easier to do what we
[1:22:23] realize may God add blessings to the
[1:22:25] reading of the word you can be SE amen
[1:22:29] praise the Lord amen I just love I just
[1:22:32] love amen to think about what is in the
[1:22:37] mind of God you know how I say sometimes
[1:22:39] man I'd like I wish I could get in his
[1:22:42] mind to see what he's thinking you know
[1:22:44] and and and that's the it is with God
[1:22:46] you know because we know that we've
[1:22:48] already talked Paul had talked about the
[1:22:51] mystery that had been hid for ages and
[1:22:54] gener generation is now being made known
[1:22:57] the manifold wisdom of almighty God in
[1:23:00] other words the purpose of God is being
[1:23:02] made known amen and so his plan is made
[1:23:06] being made known amen what was in the
[1:23:10] mind of God is being expressed and it's
[1:23:13] being lived out amen so there is
[1:23:17] absolutely nothing nothing that ever
[1:23:19] comes our way that catches God off
[1:23:23] guard it's not a surprise to him amen no
[1:23:27] he already knows he knew before the
[1:23:30] first Stardust was ever
[1:23:32] made now let's go back as we begin to
[1:23:35] think about God and we know of course
[1:23:37] through the mind of the Prophet because
[1:23:39] you know in the days of the voice of the
[1:23:41] seventh angel when he shall be the
[1:23:44] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:23:46] has declared to his servants the
[1:23:47] prophets is that right and so even the
[1:23:50] church first two three chap chapters of
[1:23:52] Revelation talks about the seven
[1:23:54] Messengers The Seven Stars to the seven
[1:23:57] Church ages and so forth you know all of
[1:23:59] that was made known the mystery of God
[1:24:01] the revelation of the Seven Seals it was
[1:24:03] opened up amen and it shows how the
[1:24:06] Antichrist would work and actually where
[1:24:08] he came in at and that's where we found
[1:24:10] serpent seed and how that H You Know Thy
[1:24:13] Sheed you know he says thy seed shall
[1:24:17] bruise his heel and so forth talking
[1:24:19] about the serpent had his seed there in
[1:24:20] the Garden of Eden is that right and we
[1:24:23] find out St John there it says you know
[1:24:25] well actually over in Matthew I believe
[1:24:27] it says Jesus said when he talked about
[1:24:29] the world being a field isn't that right
[1:24:31] and the good so went forth and he sowed
[1:24:33] good seed and he says the evil one also
[1:24:36] came and sowed evil seed and at the end
[1:24:38] of it when he was explaining it to the
[1:24:40] uh the the disciples you know they said
[1:24:42] explain us to US mean about the the the
[1:24:45] parable of the tears and the wheat he
[1:24:47] says well the I'll tell you he says the
[1:24:50] tears the actually the the wheat are the
[1:24:53] children of the king Kingdom but the
[1:24:55] tears are the children of the wicked
[1:25:01] one Amen in the CH John in in 1 John or
[1:25:04] I believe it's 1 John 3:12 somewhere in
[1:25:06] there amen it says that we don't do the
[1:25:08] works of the devil but he says not like
[1:25:10] that Wicked one not as Cain who was of
[1:25:14] that Wicked one so that linked Cain to
[1:25:17] being of that Wicked one and he showed
[1:25:20] that that's how the devil sowed his seed
[1:25:23] amen and when God came right write down
[1:25:24] to Cain and he says Cain just do what
[1:25:27] your brother does just do what your
[1:25:29] brother does and you'll be accepted cuz
[1:25:31] he was jealous cuz he had church he had
[1:25:34] offerings he worshiped God Cain did how
[1:25:38] many knows and it's the same cane today
[1:25:40] some people will worship God some people
[1:25:41] claim that they believe the Lord Jesus
[1:25:43] Christ of yesterday amen that he Calvary
[1:25:46] isn't that right but when he comes and
[1:25:48] he does the very same thing today they
[1:25:50] reject him and what you do with Jes
[1:25:54] Jesus today is what you would have done
[1:25:56] with him then that's the
[1:26:03] problem amen believe I will brother
[1:26:05] Tommy I'll get fired up here in a
[1:26:08] minute amen and mean I was listening to
[1:26:11] a tape and and and and brother brand
[1:26:14] come across and he was said something
[1:26:15] and then I wanted to say it and I said
[1:26:17] well I just replay that so I went back a
[1:26:19] little bit amen and God has provided a
[1:26:22] way in 1956 he says there's never been a
[1:26:26] time in the history of the world at any
[1:26:30] age or any time where the gospel of the
[1:26:33] power of God has been demonstrated like
[1:26:37] it is right
[1:26:40] now how many believe that seven times
[1:26:44] around the world that it was not about
[1:26:46] the man bre brandom but it was about
[1:26:48] Jesus Christ coming and doing the very
[1:26:51] same thing that he did when he walked
[1:26:53] the shores of Galilee that hasn't been
[1:26:55] done all through the
[1:26:57] dark amen the Hindu 30,000 if we talk we
[1:27:01] want a book of act let me 3,000 Souls
[1:27:05] were saved in one day no he says it was
[1:27:07] the Hindu and the Buddha and all of them
[1:27:09] when that Blind Man's eyes came open and
[1:27:12] he says I challenge your Gods all of
[1:27:13] your Gods come up here and open this
[1:27:16] Blind Man's
[1:27:17] eyes and then I'll serve your god
[1:27:20] brother benam said ain't that right but
[1:27:22] if my Lord Jesus had resurrected to
[1:27:24] th000 years ago will open up his eyes
[1:27:26] will you accept
[1:27:29] him amen he said
[1:27:32] 30,000 raw naked and women raise their
[1:27:36] hands we accept him when he opened up
[1:27:40] and they put clothes on themselves
[1:27:42] that's what the Holy Ghost will
[1:27:45] do
[1:27:47] amen praise be to God 10 times the book
[1:27:51] of Acts but that people won't believe
[1:27:54] it you can open up the you can raise the
[1:27:59] dead 13 different people raised under
[1:28:01] that Ministry is that
[1:28:04] right little girl that doesn't have any
[1:28:06] eyeballs doesn't have any eyeballs amen
[1:28:08] and he prays for him and prays for her
[1:28:10] amen prays for her to have
[1:28:12] eyes amen and then before he ends he
[1:28:15] says oh by the way what color would you
[1:28:18] like what color would you like Glory
[1:28:22] when he open up I guarantee that they
[1:28:24] were the very color that she
[1:28:27] desired I'm here to tell you God Has
[1:28:30] Come such a this message has come God
[1:28:32] has such a message that it should give

[1:28:42] message coming this is the last message
[1:28:46] the last Angel seventh angel
[1:28:56] because we know the destruction is
[1:28:58] coming Sodom and gomor is
[1:29:01] here confusion is here religious
[1:29:05] confusion is here but God came to give
[1:29:08] us a clear path and to make us to know
[1:29:11] that it wasn't brother brandom it wasn't
[1:29:13] some other it was Jes in brother

[1:39:24] so there was God before the of the world
[1:39:29] and we know that he wasn't even God at
[1:39:30] one time God means an object of workship
[1:39:34] he was just the self-existing one he
[1:39:37] existed all by himself I thought on I
[1:39:40] thought about this on the way to church
[1:39:42] I thought you know I love to think about
[1:39:44] God what what kind of a being what kind
[1:39:47] of a being is able to make Earth the Sun
[1:39:52] the Moon to stars and hang all of
[1:39:57] that wo does do something to you think
[1:40:00] there is a being in the universe that
[1:40:02] made all of
[1:40:04] this made you he made me he made
[1:40:07] everything without him and there was
[1:40:09] nothing made but what was made by him
[1:40:12] everything was made by
[1:40:16] him Amen Let me just tap into the future
[1:40:20] just a little bit one of the things that
[1:40:22] this is done with this cancer and this
[1:40:24] thing that the God has allowed amen it
[1:40:26] has made and I've heard Donna say it and
[1:40:28] it certainly applies to me and I'm sure
[1:40:30] it applies to you amen but this whole
[1:40:32] thing has made amen this seem like a new
[1:40:37] book these words of faith and believing
[1:40:40] it's just takes on a whole new
[1:40:44] meaning man I going into my search
[1:40:47] subject just a little bit
[1:40:50] further brother Tommy if I'm not wrong
[1:40:54] before your
[1:40:56] aarta episode youed a little LAX on God
[1:41:00] is that right felt like he was just in a
[1:41:02] hum drum a little Lolly kind of just
[1:41:05] kind of hum drumming around and I want
[1:41:07] to talk to you here after a little bit
[1:41:09] about the purpose of this and so I
[1:41:10] believe everything's for a purpose don't
[1:41:12] you we'll pick that up but let's go back
[1:41:14] again we think about God all by himself
[1:41:16] dwell
[1:41:18] alone dwelt
[1:41:20] alone there was God all by himself for
[1:41:27] eons on eons and eons and I'm sorry but
[1:41:32] it's more human mind can
[1:41:35] comprehend we we we we just he never had
[1:41:38] a beginning we always want to think well
[1:41:41] where did it start because for us
[1:41:44] everything started somewhere is that
[1:41:46] right but he never did start never did
[1:41:48] finish
[1:41:50] amen he never did start never does end
[1:41:54] is that right he always was so I don't
[1:41:57] know about you sometimes for some people
[1:42:00] it may it maybe uh it's more than their
[1:42:02] mind can comprehend or more than they
[1:42:04] can
[1:42:07] believe it's easier for them that there
[1:42:10] was some big bang somewhere and we all
[1:42:12] just come into existence that's right
[1:42:15] that's why you know my fingers didn't
[1:42:17] come
[1:42:19] Christ huh if a big bang would be
[1:42:22] probably produced something like like
[1:42:23] that but aren't you glad that the god
[1:42:24] that put your fingers in line was a
[1:42:27] Divine
[1:42:31] designer that's right usually I say
[1:42:34] design divver or something but I said it
[1:42:37] right this morning Divine
[1:42:40] designer he was by
[1:42:43] himself
[1:42:44] amen
[1:42:46] now there he
[1:42:51] was and you ask yourself
[1:42:54] what is he what is
[1:42:58] he what is
[1:43:01] he
[1:43:05] well being
[1:43:08] alone he was
[1:43:10] alone and that's one thing that God
[1:43:13] doesn't want to be he don't want to be
[1:43:16] alone he's been alone long enough
[1:43:25] that's just one thing but that's what we
[1:43:28] want to talk about with the help of the
[1:43:29] Lord and I will skip over a lot of it
[1:43:32] because I want to get down to what I
[1:43:33] really want to
[1:43:35] say but when we think about there he was
[1:43:38] what is he well how many knows that
[1:43:44] God a
[1:43:46] father in him was to be a
[1:43:49] father but there was no children
[1:43:53] in him was to be a
[1:43:57] savior but there was nothing to
[1:44:00] save in him was to be a
[1:44:05] deliverer is that
[1:44:09] right and we can just take one of those
[1:44:13] things H let me go back again one of the
[1:44:17] first things that God
[1:44:20] was was a god
[1:44:24] him made the god of
[1:44:26] Glory right May the god of Glory Be With

[1:44:37] glorious he had a
[1:44:40] glory about him he's
[1:44:44] glorious and in the Book of Revelations

[1:44:52] Down and Worship him that liveth forever
[1:44:54] and ever and cast their crowns Before
[1:44:56] the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh
[1:44:59] Lord to
[1:45:01] receive
[1:45:03] Glory how many believe that all glory
[1:45:08] goes to
[1:45:09] him anytime a preacher or laid my hands
[1:45:13] on somebody and this out of there you
[1:45:15] don't get no glory no all glory goes to
[1:45:20] God because anything good

[1:45:51] thousands of thousands saying with a
[1:45:53] loud voice saying Worthy is a lamb that

[1:48:53] the Bible says Jesus was crucified he
[1:48:55] was crucified before the foundation of
[1:48:57] the world where in the mind of God it
[1:49:01] happened before the world ever
[1:49:03] began Revelations
[1:49:07] 138 All Shall Wonder after the Beast

[1:49:47] saving power his delivering power how
[1:49:51] many knows he's a mighty
[1:49:56] warrior I love to think about
[1:50:00] him a
[1:50:04] warrior there's names that are forever
[1:50:08] edged in the Bible and in history the
[1:50:12] people that God has used to display his
[1:50:15] power and His
[1:50:19] glory like
[1:50:21] David amen
[1:50:23] if I
[1:50:24] ask wild back there what did David
[1:50:28] do Jonathan what did David
[1:50:33] do what did
[1:50:36] he he killed go that's right the
[1:50:39] littlest child knows about
[1:50:41] David why because he surrendered himself
[1:50:44] and God used him to do what everybody
[1:50:47] else St in their Fox all to know they
[1:50:50] were scar not David
[1:50:53] no so is that name is forever Edge
[1:50:55] that's being used to God to bring goath
[1:50:59] down
[1:51:01] amen praise the
[1:51:04] Lord Brother Brandon was telling the
[1:51:07] story whenever that Maniac came up to
[1:51:10] the platform and he says I'm going to
[1:51:12] break every bone in your body you
[1:51:14] hypocrite preacher the brother Brandon
[1:51:16] call him a hypocrite preacher and
[1:51:17] everything else that done broke the Jaws
[1:51:20] I think of a couple other preachers
[1:51:22] beaten him up you know and he says he
[1:51:25] was well able to do it is that right and
[1:51:29] he started to come forward to him and
[1:51:31] they the ushers wanted them to maybe
[1:51:33] bring the police and come after that guy
[1:51:34] and wrestle him down but man says hold
[1:51:36] him
[1:51:37] off right said don't arrest him leave
[1:51:40] him alone the Holy Spirit spoke to him
[1:51:42] because you have challenged the spirit
[1:51:44] of God you will fall on my feet is that
[1:51:48] right amen he come tow Jim
[1:51:53] amen I'm not spit did he spit on him he
[1:51:57] actually spit on brother random that
[1:52:00] right I'll show you whose feet I'll fall
[1:52:03] under he come up and swung fell right
[1:52:06] down and pinned his feet to the ground
[1:52:08] can you just see the angel in the
[1:52:10] Supernatural s you little
[1:52:13] guy I'll show you why cuz there's an
[1:52:17] angel of God with present with the
[1:52:18] prophet 24/7 never left his side amen
[1:52:23] even when Billy Paul saw him Angel was
[1:52:25] always looking at him why cuz there's
[1:52:27] demon powers that want to take your life
[1:52:29] there's demon forces that want to get
[1:52:31] you how many believes every child has
[1:52:33] that angel around
[1:52:37] them that's
[1:52:44] right that's not my words Bible says the
[1:52:49] angels of the Lord are encamped round
[1:52:51] about them that fear Glory that's God's
[1:52:54] word he's got you back I'm glad for that
[1:52:58] praise be to God that's right in many of
[1:53:02] the things like that when we think about
[1:53:04] of how God was a deliverer he was a
[1:53:07] savior he's a
[1:53:09] father and I want to again in the church
[1:53:12] age book talking about how to God before
[1:53:15] the foundation of the world he here in
[1:53:17] is the love of uh God presented that God
[1:53:20] wanted a a family of his own sons and
[1:53:23] daughters like himself how many believe
[1:53:26] that's
[1:53:27] God's that's that that's the message
[1:53:30] that's the gospel nutshell so to speak
[1:53:32] God wanted a family that's why he
[1:53:35] created a man and a woman and children
[1:53:37] and grandchildren cuz that's what he had
[1:53:39] in his mind he wanted to be a father he
[1:53:42] wanted a wife the bride has made herself
[1:53:45] ready how many believe God of Jesus
[1:53:48] Christ and it's important that a husband
[1:53:50] and and a think the same
[1:53:53] amen I want you to know we want to think
[1:53:56] if he says you're here I'm Healed if he
[1:53:59] says I'm delivered and I'm delivered if
[1:54:01] he says I'm a Son of God I'm a of
[1:54:05] God I don't care what the devil
[1:54:09] says
[1:54:11] amen praise be to God he wanted a family
[1:54:15] of his own and then he'll chasen those
[1:54:17] Sons and Daughters of God even as a
[1:54:20] parent chastises their children will
[1:54:22] them and everything else teaches them
[1:54:25] trains them not always about getting a
[1:54:28] beating but it's about getting lessons
[1:54:31] being
[1:54:33] taught how many believes that being
[1:54:35] taught in the ways of God so that we can
[1:54:38] understand how that God thinks what he
[1:54:40] wants what his desires
[1:54:44] are see Israel had a problem Israel
[1:54:49] Israel could never really understand
[1:54:52] understand God's ways and his thinking
[1:54:55] how many knows it's important that we
[1:54:57] understand the purpose of God and the
[1:54:59] way that God
[1:55:00] thinks the reason and sometime maybe
[1:55:03] we'll take a lesson on suffering why God
[1:55:05] allows us to suffer amen and all these
[1:55:09] things that God allows it's important to
[1:55:11] understand why there's trials why in the
[1:55:13] world that God would lead the children
[1:55:15] of Israel out in that right Mighty hand
[1:55:19] make Pharaoh so miserable until he says
[1:55:21] just get out of here take wife take your
[1:55:23] children take everything and just get
[1:55:25] out of here I can't
[1:55:30] stand and I can't stand the first Barn

[1:55:37] getting BN ain't that
[1:55:41] right finally he realized he's got to
[1:55:44] let
[1:55:50] go poor phoh
[1:55:53] he had persecuted the children of
[1:55:55] God what God did to
[1:55:58] him is that right all the things that he
[1:56:02] had done to
[1:56:04] God
[1:56:06] probably
[1:56:10] God this he hardened his heart
[1:56:23] pharoh

[2:06:42] of you Lord help us
[2:06:46] amen all right now another one
[2:06:53] here we get to my thought what I want to
[2:06:55] share with you this morning and what
[2:06:56] we're in notice a
[2:06:59] Shepherd a Shepherd after he gets them
[2:07:02] all numbered and they're all bted down
[2:07:04] the shepherd goes down to this hole
[2:07:06] where the Sheep had come in at and lays
[2:07:09] himself across that hole maybe that
[2:07:11] narrow place is that right and no wolf
[2:07:14] can come no Thief can come in no harm
[2:07:18] can come
[2:07:19] in unless it comes over the shepherd
[2:07:24] first folks I'm here to tell you well
[2:07:27] this isn't just something the devil
[2:07:28] slipped in on us so we're going to throw
[2:07:31] him up because we never expected this
[2:07:33] and guess what this out other the devil
[2:07:35] didn't do nothing but what he had to go
[2:07:38] over the shepherd
[2:07:40] first now you tell me if the shepherd
[2:07:43] allows you to get cancer why my wife to
[2:07:46] get cancer it has to have permission
[2:07:48] from
[2:07:49] God that's right nothing goes over that
[2:07:52] CH and if it is then I want you to know
[2:07:56] something that God has a purpose in
[2:07:58] it he don't do it for fun he don't do it
[2:08:01] for no reason he has a purpose in
[2:08:06] it there's a purpose in it there's a
[2:08:09] reason for
[2:08:10] it
[2:08:13] amen and I've already seen probably more
[2:08:16] reasons than what I can number I can
[2:08:19] already see the purpose of God and the
[2:08:21] and what it has done and what it's doing
[2:08:25] wouldn't it be sad if something like
[2:08:26] that happened we'd be all confused about
[2:08:28] the whole thing and one wonder what this
[2:08:30] happened wonder what this is but when
[2:08:32] you see one of the things it does amen
[2:08:36] and it gets you
[2:08:39] right
[2:08:40] amen first things I H I'm every time I
[2:08:44] fussed at you or did anything to you
[2:08:46] honey I'm so sorry forgive me and she me
[2:08:50] too thank you know I've done things too
[2:08:52] I'm so sorry amen the first thing that
[2:08:54] happens amen there's a cleansing that
[2:08:56] comes forth amen and there closeness God
[2:08:59] you begin to draw nigh to God and your
[2:09:02] slackness and your lukewarmness and your
[2:09:04] laziness it's got to go by the wayside
[2:09:06] God don't want us look warm he want us H
[2:09:09] for
[2:09:11] God is that Tomy not mediocre hot for
[2:09:18] God Amen
[2:09:21] he wants us as a church hot for God and
[2:09:25] oh my we know that
[2:09:32] uh Trump got
[2:09:35] it what's her
[2:09:37] name didn't get
[2:09:39] it
[2:09:41] Camala chameleon I mean
[2:09:44] Camala Kamala didn't get it it's very
[2:09:48] likely that that scripture is not in the
[2:09:50] past
[2:09:52] could easy
[2:09:53] be woman had Rosen power they made Havoc
[2:09:56] of the place is that right could be
[2:09:58] sometimes more simple I'm not saying it
[2:10:00] is could be now Trump and all this
[2:10:03] everything that's happened and the way
[2:10:05] that it's gone amen and so to speak to
[2:10:08] him coming back and and the next thing
[2:10:11] according to the vision is that going to
[2:10:13] destroy America a fire is fixing the
[2:10:16] fall so what's the purpose of this what

[2:21:23] each one of you God saved you in the
[2:21:27] same way by
[2:21:31] faith if you're saved this morning if
[2:21:34] you holy ghost in your heart you got it
[2:21:37] because of the faith that you
[2:21:41] had if you believe in your heart that
[2:21:44] God has raised him from Thou shalt be
[2:21:46] saved you believe that with all of your
[2:21:49] heart amen when Jesus said come and
[2:21:51] follow me and mean you willing to
[2:21:53] forsake mom forsake dad forsake Church
[2:21:56] forsake everything for Christ when
[2:21:59] accepts your sacrifice and your
[2:22:01] repentance amen
[2:22:03] God fa through faith that not of
[2:22:06] yourself that faith is a gift of
[2:22:10] God W what is that Faith that's not your
[2:22:14] faith my wife said many times no it's
[2:22:16] not my faith it's God's faith in me
[2:22:26] it's God's faith in me you were saved by
[2:22:29] faith you could not come here I says you
[2:22:32] could come here and you could cry and
[2:22:35] pray and pray and cry all this week and
[2:22:39] next week and next month you could be at
[2:22:42] the altar crying and pray ask God to
[2:22:47] forgive
[2:22:49] you he says you'd be there a month and
[2:22:53] you'd still be a
[2:22:55] sinner until you accept what he has
[2:22:59] done you've got to accept that he has
[2:23:02] forgiven
[2:23:04] you that's where it
[2:23:06] lays accepting what's already been done
[2:23:11] how many know every Redemptive has
[2:23:13] already been paid
[2:23:15] for sometimes we are let's admit it so
[2:23:17] sometimes we're good at have faith for
[2:23:18] saving of our souls but when it comes to
[2:23:21] the healing of the body and cast out
[2:23:22] devils and Cancers and stuff like that
[2:23:24] sometimes we're a little weak we need
[2:23:26] our faith exercise we need stronger
[2:23:30] Faith Sav you
[2:23:33] amen that's right accept him is that
[2:23:36] right that's right it's not your crying
[2:23:38] that saves you it's your faith that
[2:23:40] saves you that's right now there's just
[2:23:43] a little instructions on might say to
[2:23:46] the sick you might come here and be
[2:23:48] prayed for you might have angels to lay
[2:23:50] hands on
[2:23:52] you and it'll never do you one thing to
[2:23:56] you until you first believe
[2:24:01] it now isn't it funny I didn't realize
[2:24:04] that would match with that first story I
[2:24:06] read so well Angel the angel of the Lord
[2:24:09] was there ready to touch her and
[2:24:13] actually even removed the darkness from
[2:24:15] her actually even removed it because she
[2:24:18] said she believed but the second she I
[2:24:20] doubted it it came back isn't that right
[2:24:25] an angel could touch
[2:24:27] you but if you don't believe it you'll
[2:24:30] never get it it's your belief your faith
[2:24:33] in your heart that does it
[2:24:39] amen while we're on
[2:24:47] this and one of the multitude answer and
[2:24:50] said master I have brought unto thee my
[2:24:52] son which ha a dumb spirit and he taketh

[2:45:23] was wounded he died for our spiritual
[2:45:26] man for our soul to be saved and at the
[2:45:28] end of that scriptures and by his
