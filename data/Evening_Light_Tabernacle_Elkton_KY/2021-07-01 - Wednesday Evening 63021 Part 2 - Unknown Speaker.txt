========================================

amen and it just turns them away from the message that's why they tuck tail and run when they hit 18 or whatever it might be or get a little money in their pocket amen it's not because they had no conviction toward what you were saying but if they ever get it they'll change they'll change right he said i've been a nazarite under god from my mother's womb he said if i be shaven my strength will go from me and i shall be weak and be like any other man now listen this is a perfect example of a man who loses his conviction and god because his name was on the book hallelujah delilah could cause his hair to be shaven listen to me church she could not touch the root the root stayed intact that's why you could stand there and say oh lord one more time and shook the pillars down around every one of them because no matter what she might have done to his hair she couldn't touch the root and that's where true conviction lied is at the root amen when he got destitute desperate and finally give his heart to god and his strength to god there are more philistines killed in that particular time than all through his whole ministry oh oh that seems odd don't it but that's that's the power of conviction now determine me to first timothy chapter 4 verse 1 1 and two now notice here in the last days the way that uh the holy ghost is going to deal with people and it's gonna be very straight there's not gonna be any cutting of the corners it's gonna be very very transparent very clear the message is going to be clear not ambiguous not not kind of a well i don't know what he's really trying to say no the message will be plain it'll be plain first timothy chapter four verse one how the spirit speaketh expressingly amen that means plain spoken that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron now this word that he uses here is is uh the greek word carrizo which is where we get the english word cauterize jonathan jones you know many of you know jonathan his grandmother had an accident when she was a young girl and lost one of her arms and when they had this part where the injury was at in order to sustain her health and to heal bring healing to the wounds of course we know doctors don't heal but to put her in a position where god could heal they had to take an instrument and go down through each one's nerves or that arm where the injury was and go right down through those places and completely sever that nerve ending and then tie those loose places together to make a place where her body could begin the healing process and once those nerves are cauterized there's no more feeling in it it's completely dead there's not an instrument in the world that can resurrect it the life source that would repair the damaged nerve has now been cut off and there's no more blood that can flow to that spot to ever resurrect it again and now here paul is speaking that in the last days that some would not have body parts cauterized but their conscience would be seared or cauterized with a hot iron meaning that they can come to church and sit down and hear the preaching of the gospel and remain so numb that nothing that's said or nothing the holy ghost does moves them they just sit and look there's no way of resurrecting their soul there's no way of resurrecting their passion there's no way of resurrecting their feeling or their conviction it's been completely cut off altogether notice this in ii corinthians chapter seven beginning at verse 8. now the apostle paul is trying to deal with this corinthians bunch if you want to read that with me this is the second book of corinthians 7 and verse 8. and you know he had a mess on his hands i mean he was dealing with those folks down there that evening like i i i i mean in corinthians and he was dealing with them everywhere he'd have they had this problem and that problem and all kinds of little things here and there yeah so paul writes him a letter now watch he said in another place he said though i'm not there in bodies i've judged it in the spirit remember was reported from the house of chloe that a man was living with his fat with his uh uh with his father's wife for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent that's a strange thing in it sorry but i ain't sorry well my mama used to want me brother al she'd lay it on me and she'd say i'm sorry but i'm not sorry even though human is speaking she didn't want to have to correct me but she had to paul saying here i i made you sorry yeah for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season but now i rejoice watch now not that you were made sorry but that you sorrowed to repentance amen for you were made sorry after a godly manner and you might receive damage by us and nothing in other words paul's saying i didn't come trying to hurt your feelings i didn't come making this gospel personal i didn't try to call individuals out to shame them or to make it some personal affair but the purpose of my letter was to try to strike in your hearts some element of conviction that lets you know you've got to get these matters straightened up before the lord amen for godly sorrow what so doesn't it seem like in this day and age we're getting the car before the horse quite a bit we preached good sermons about the bride the elected and how elected and how bright and how elected and how bright we are we get people shouting we get them rejoicing we get them running to the altar and they'll rejoice and they'll shout under the understanding we are the bride we are the bride we are the bride and many of them that are standing right there they're as sinners as the devil is so why don't we start with godly sorrow well you know why we don't because that kind of preaching has become quite unpopular these days we don't like the preachers that get up in the platform and preach to us in a manner to make us feel everybody ready uncomfortable we don't like them sermons how dare he make me feel in such a way or not while that preacher mind his own business because i'm called of god not to i'm called of god to be nosy i'm called of god to get in your business i'm called of god to get in your face i'm called of god to preach the truth to you and get plumbed into your bedroom if i need to you understand what i mean i'm trying to say the secret places preachers ain't got no business in your bedroom i'm saying the dark places i'm called of god to preach in a manner that even what the king says in his bedchamber god can bring it down preachers are called a medal and if he's a good one he'll meddle well and if he's a sorry noah account hollywood evangelist or whatever he might be you'll leave out here feeling so good glory to god i'm the elected of god i'm going to make the rapture and then what happens on monday when you face you again so i i've got to where i don't even preach about people facing the devil because we're kind of behind that now really your biggest enemy ain't facing the devil on monday morning i'm just facing you again praise the lord somebody it's being able to wake up and look yourself in the mirror and go okay what am i going to mess up today how am i going to fall short today come on don't y'all look at me that way right the great enemy that lays within this flesh there's an element of it that we know we've got to face that when we walk out of here how am i going to overcome myself i've got to have somebody preach it to me in a manner of such conviction whether when i walk out of the church stores there's got to be that element of oh god i'm going to i'm determined i am determined i'm going to change from today on god helping me friends i love to feel good i love to feel the holy ghost if the holy spirit fell in this building i would encourage every shout we could get but i've prayed for tens of thousands of around the world that have shouted until they've passed out on the floor and then a month later find out they're living in polygamy they're drunkards they smoke secretly and on and on and on and on what good does all of the rejoicing and the running and all of that do if the if the absence of conviction praise god i can certainly feel the holy ghost is pleased with this tonight can certainly feel the holy ghost is pleased with this tonight that's what i look for is i look for that element of conviction in a church you won't know how to determine where i preach when i go somewhere and i preach and the people still have that feeling of wanting to get rightly gone i know this is going to sound strange to you maybe i've done a lady too much i don't know people say i always you tell them too much i don't know how not to tell them i i just quit gaging what do they need to hear what don't they need to hear i just figured i say it i'll let the chips fall when they made god work on that but i think we've come too far to keep putting seven things in the backyard but there's been times in my ministry where i've actually shunned some of the big revival meetings that i've been invited to because i knew some of those meetings were nothing but modern day pentecostal workups and i knew if i really preached where i needed to preach i'd never be asked back again so rather than fool with it i just wait on the lord wait on the lord wait on the lord one year becomes two two becomes twelve twelve comes fifteen all of a sudden i see a little entrance and the lord said okay now it's time and just like i always know it's usually my last bunch of sermons because i refuse as the gods put it in my heart this way i refuse to stand before him on the day of judgment knowing that people needed a deeper experience and be guilty of knowing how to take it there and not take it there i'd rather preach it in a manner that strikes your conscience and something begins to churn in your heart stirring up your pure man's what peter said we need that stirring of the holy ghost hallelujah notice the deceived church by the world now this is in june of 59 brother brown's really upbraiding the tabernacle and i want to use this as an example for where we're at he starts out with revival in our day how can we have revival when we're so bound up he said we bound the holy spirit with our organizations and traditions we can't have a holy ghost revival he said amen i know that's scorching hot with the weather here he said but it's the truth how can we have a holy ghost revival when you're so bound and starchy they found your secret the world found your secret watch what he does you women all bob your hair goes like the world you men go out and act like the world tell jokes and dirty jokes and smoke a few cigarettes run out with a neighbor's wife and everything like that a little sociable drink to hold a job i'd rather lay on my branch on my stomach and my belly and eat soda crackers drink branched water and stay clean and fear before god then compromise for any kind of a job he said that's right that's true stay true to god samson the philistines is on the branham tabernacle worldliness and is creeping in among you now this is 1959. now what was brother branham trying to show with him examples about the man and the woman he's trying to show the people you have lost your conviction let me tell you something brother a man and a woman stay right with god and stay under the prayer of life and convicting power that person you'll never catch them commit an adult tree and running around and smoking cigarettes and let that man or woman stand under the convicting power of the holy ghost you will not find them let him get away from it one time and but for god's mercy there will be a mess tomorrow night that's the secret is the power of god inside the bride that is attached to our conviction have you exposed your secret that god gave you when you were wallowing in a sawdust think of that have you let it creep out by social formal worship in our mind social formal worship is kind of that real quiet backward let me tell you something brother formality takes on many different forms coming to the altar jumping and screaming and shouting and praising the lord and speaking unknown languages and running around the church can become just as much a form as somebody forgive this arm crossers i'm not poking on you but for somebody that's just sitting in the pew that can become just as much a form as the backward stuff social formal worship social worship you know what social work is where in the world do we come to such a place in the message where we clap in unison rather than older amen are we the ball are we watching an opera where did all the clappers come from i've been in so many churches where they don't even say amen anymore there's clap that's social formal worship it's easy to stand there and clap in unison at every word amen go watch john hagee and joe osteen watch joe joel osean when he gets up there and he's and he hits one big point give him praise and they'll clap in unison that can become just as much a formality as people sitting there staring at the floor some of y'all didn't like it but i can't help truth anyhow god in the church church book brother man said god wants listen to this word spontaneous i'm trying to underline it christian worship spontaneous christian worship isn't this is what we do every time we come to church to keep out of that if you're one that raises up your right right arm come church raise up the left one and there's somebody says amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah change it up don't get stuck in a rut in reform and don't just do what everybody else is doing so if you're in a church and everybody's hollering praise the lord and amen be the one that sits quiet oh here we go flipping the coin and if you're in a church where everybody says quiet and look you'll be the one holiday man come on evening light talk a little while the formality is the lack it's the worship without conviction go talk to any of the people that come out of pentecost how many old-timers if i could be respectful that way come out of pentecost anybody abby solid you ever heard this expression hold on turn loose set big smile on his face back there everyone they got to the altar one was beating them on the back telling them to hold on and the other one was beating them on the back telling them to turn loose my mama used to work the episode the alters and apostolic and she would work him to one two three four o'clock in the morning and the purpose of it was brother uh john was to get him to the spot to where they would speak in tongues that's formality maybe god didn't call them to speak in tongues maybe god didn't want them speaking in tongues maybe god wanted that individual crying until they had no more tears who am i to beat them on the back and tell them what they're supposed to do well brother tom i've enjoyed the years we've had together buddy i keep this up all right he said god can come down and perform miracles and go right down through the audience and tell people the secrets of their heart everything heal the sick and afflict to do signs and wonders preach his word as hard as they can and the holy ghost will move and people will say well i guess that's all right we enjoy listening to it once in a while if we're not too tired that's branham tabernacle the philistines is on thee he wants to pass that way you know conviction can make you restless you know in our in our our meetings whenever i'm i'm if i'm in charge of any kind of meeting being an outreach or whatever it is and there's deacons there i always instruct the deacons that when conviction is on to pay attention to the people that are running in and out that are beginning to move around talk fidget pay attention close to them i always instruct them this way when conviction gets on a person they'll start acting out in a way to get it off of them i've seen them run out of the bathroom 30 times and you know what i do when i see him doing that i start preaching right down about right in here that way i can catch him eyeball to eyeball every time i come through that door conviction will make them do a lot of things they'll act restless they'll act wild all trying to push off that feeling of conviction and yet when god's got your number you couldn't run you couldn't hide because he will bring you to the altar one way or another jonah proved to us that you can't run from god come on somebody it proves to us that just a little touch of conviction amen can put a person in a dire strait till they're almost crazy out of their mind listen to this remark how many of us would really pray this way brother brahman said for you sinners in here tonight that didn't get right in this meeting i'm going to pray that god makes your bed so hard and your food tastes so bad and your friends be so unlovely till you get right with god how many of us with the right understanding would really pray that way you know what we pray god bless them make life a flower bed of ease for them if it's our youngins or if it's our grandkids or family member we pray god give them a good day i don't want to pray that if they're in sin god make them so miserable they don't know what tomorrow holds god make their bed sleep see already it's crickets in here but this is the way we need to pray we need this kind of conviction amen to father call our sons and daughters and our grandkids until they can come back to god and say i am miserable i need a move of the holy ghost in my life as long as they're comfortable they're never going to want to get out of that god make uncomfortable if you've got to make it hurt but do all but don't take their life oh hallelujah brother said a good praying wife or mother now listen here mom's wives a good praying wife or mother can do more for the kingdom of god on her knees at home than sometimes a preacher can do on the platform why because i can preach but if there's no conviction they won't listen but you get a good old holy ghost mama that's got a little understanding about how to pray and let her get on her knees and start calling out them boys and them girl's name every day and she got a prayer list out before and she starts calling out maybe it's susie or johnny oh god make john he's so miserable he needs you but just lord keep your hand on his life until he can get right it wouldn't be too many turns of the sun you'd be getting phone calls in the middle of the night restless i'm miserable what do i do glad you called me i'm going to tell you you don't have to tell them cut wait and come to church pray with them right there don't wait when conviction's on pray with them right there that's why you the church of the lord jesus christ you don't need to speak confident in just brother tom's prayers or sister byler's prayers or the other leaders of this church you need to have such a relationship with god that if your lost loved ones and your wayward ones come and call you on the telephone or send you a text message you want to be able to write the words back to them in a text message that has such power of the holy ghost that the holy ghost can mix them right where they're sitting there because of you because this message ain't supposed to be about us preachers or preachers lives this message is about the body of christ finding their position yes again the man says you know you can find plenty of excuses when conviction is on that's another tell sign of when you got somebody under conviction watch them well that's a deep subject they'll make every excuse in the world why they can't be here or there or a or b or c well that's all right you know conviction is on again in purpose straight by perfect weakness brother i said conviction you don't have to just say one thing brother god's there and he's done the work while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on him that heard the word see no water call no such thing in the bible when you persuade and pull and scare people and talk people in if a volleyball game will get them in a soccer game will put them out if a hot dog roast will bring them in a hamburger supper will run around if i stood up here and got y'all cried about it your grandmother prayed for you glory to god she prayed for you that you would get saved you come to this you come because you're feeling toward grandma you didn't come because god convicted your horn i'm not making fun i'm just trying to dramatize it for you this is how deep people get into the emotions of it they pull with and i don't doubt that they don't mean it with all of their heart but it's not scriptural did you know there's never a call made in the bible the word was preached and convictions set in this we will do if god permit i'll continue to make all the calls i'll continue to call sinners to the front backsliders whatever they are christians i'll continue to make calls but really that's not the way that that is not the evidence that something's happening the evidence of something has taken place is when there's such conviction there i like to see it when they come and they can't even talk i was in arkansas preaching the weekend and sunday morning i i i we were singing a song and i was getting ready to close it and all once the holy spirit grabbed me and said make a call make a prayer line so i stopped the people i had them bow their heads a moment and i started talking to him i said now the lord's dealing with you come on and one after another just started lining up there was about 12 of them i guess 8 or 10 12 something like that and and i and i started praying and the ones that were under such deep conviction they couldn't even speak i i said don't worry about it i'm gonna pray for you it bothers me when i see people come to an altar and they're supposed to be under a deep conviction and they walk with him i need the holy ghost to need to be closer to god you know what i want to tell them many times you go back and sit down until you're serious because that's not the attitude of somebody who's serious some flipping thing you understand me if you ask a preacher that and you mean it in your heart you be your own judge of what you mean in your heart but the majority of the time when people are asking things you know as well as i do it's for the sake of asking because they feel like they got to do some religious duty to stay right or well he's there he can pray for me well let's just go up there no no when you're really sincere now i've had him come and just as simply say i need to be closer to god i can feel it i feel under the anointing when i'm standing up there and somebody wants to be close to god i can feel it but i can also tell when they're not too serious about it i just want to be close to god yeah if you really do then when i pray for you or somebody else but i'm talking about me personally when i pray for you something is going to happen why does some of these ones that come and say i want to be closer to god when i pray for him it's like praying for this pew right here no anointing no faith no movement no pull you know why people were saying things out of routine out of a religious feeling not genuine conviction before the lord because if it's real conviction and you come to a preaching say i want to be right with god hey buddy i've had to go strike him before i even get to lay my hands on him and i'll step back and say you believe it's already done yes i said go on and take it then i was in a revival up in ottawa then uh in uh by niagara falls preaching a young people's meeting and there was about i'd say 50 young people that come up to the front trying to watch the time and i would say just calling a number 25 of them were sincere 25 of them were doing it for the sake of doing it you know what was amazing to me the ones that come up there were just up there because that was the routine of it that when i went to go pray for them it was as dry as it could be you know what i started doing after about two or three of them i took a step back and i started talking to them i asked one young man do you really mean that with all of your heart sure why why do you mean it this whole preacher was standing by the time he went and i thought to myself i'm sorry that you're too lazy to do the job but i'm going to do some work while i'm here i said why why do you want god to move for you well i need to be right i said that ain't the way you come to the lord son if you know it is a desperate thing that this thing is plaguing you this thing is overcoming you and you're never gonna get right with god never gonna get to the place to where you have true victory unless you've got that true desperation in your heart and i sat him down again that preacher went i made him sit there for about 30 minutes i walked over to him i nudged him on the shoulder i said how do you feel about it now he said you know what after thinking about what you said brother ben you're right i wasn't sincere enough about it i said now tell me why do you want god to move for you he started weeping he said because this thing has plagued me all my life and i don't know how to whip it i said now god can move for you what was the difference that touch of conviction that little something that raises up in the heart where you know god is your only hope routines will never produce a rapture huh i said routines will never produce the rapture amen brother batman said that's right he said then he said people must come sanely soberly under conviction and receive christ the first thing they do they receive christ sitting in their seat next be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the mission of those sins those things that they have been convinced that they're wrong see there's the baby doll because we we've gotten to such a trend friends where when it comes to preaching i mean us us as human beings if we be honest it's that's hard sermons like that or somebody just keep driving that nail home until they get you a place to where you're convinced that is a difficult job to do for a bunch of hard-headed people that don't believe that you're telling the truth when you try to tell a bunch of message people that they need a deeper move of the holy ghost they will sit on you like i i don't know what they'd sit on like i don't know that the catholics would be as stubborn as some of our people would be i've had church of god apostolic pentecostal and every one of them that had a whole lot more tender spirit than some of our arrogant people around this message why because we're convinced brother brad we're convinced that we're okay we believe a prophet we believe a message and then we come to a message church we pay our tithes offerings we've got our pastor we've got our post to duty what do we need more of god for this is why you need to be convinced and sometimes the holy ghost has got to drive that now so hard that you feel grieved at him you've heard me use the expression before people tell me after service he looked right at me when he said that and i hope the holy ghost gets so deep in your tater patch that he looks at that you're the only one in the building i was looking at because then that's when results will come sure praise the lord he said they've reminded of their sins because they've repented but baptized as a memorial to god it's i've received christ as my personal savior then you're a candidate for the holy ghost he said but many people continue on persuading and calling the altar and so forth which that's all right i'll go with that perfectly right as far as i'm concerned anybody that wants to do it but it's not scriptural he said i'd like to stay with the scripture now what's brother i'm referring to as many message people have said through the years do away with order calls we don't need them that's not what brother branham is saying that is a preacher's agenda and not what the prophet of god said this we will do if god permit but the idea was not if you need to get right with god it takes an altar call to do it do you know if you walked into this church tonight and if no more than just what i little bit i preached has pricked your heart and sitting right there in your seat you can feel on the inside of you you know what that that brother he's telling me the truth i need to be deeper i need to be more sincere i need to get back that feeling maybe in your mind you started thinking i remember when it used to be that way don't you understand what's happening the altar call is taking place right then because that's what the benefit of the altar call is is to get the people in that mode of thinking you see when the children of israel would make great conquests god would tell them when they come across jordan pile up stones as a memorial you remember the little fringe that the little woman touched remember if you go back in the old testament the reason they put that fringe on the garment of the israelites that fringe on the garment of the israelites was a memorial of god's deliverance and when she touched the hem that fringe of his garment she was remembering god's deliverance in her own body she was testifying by touching if i could touch just the hem glory to god then god would have to remember his word that he is a deliverer so sometimes you tell stories as brother branham did but sometimes god can get your attention in different ways can i get a few minutes of your time i'm out of notes i could move to the next sermon but i think we're doing pretty good are you but there was a man he was hunting with that they used to call old lizard eyes and brother branham never quoted a scripture to him brother branham never said hey i'm elijah you better get right he pulled out a little whistle and called for a baby deer to come out and burt was going to blow the heart out of the mother that come looking for that baby deer an old bert looking at that mother doe or that mother dear got so under conviction so brother branson said i turned my head waiting for the shot to go obviously when i looked he said the gun was shaking like this said billy lead me to that jesus you've been talking about my point is friends when you have a heart that god can deal with he can use anything to get your attention [Applause] raise me to god the key of it is just be able to have your attention god oh praise the lord amen just be in a position where god can turn on the light friends don't take this wrong it i i know this this sounds so out of season i'm tired of meetings where people are hollering shouting jumping i'm wore out with them i love it i appreciate it but i'm wore out with them because i'll tell you what i see i see a lot of people that are getting enthused about a mess they know nothing about i see a lot of people get excited about a truth that they cannot share with you from a personal experience i'm not against worship you know me i love to hear the saints of god praise the lord and if you get stimulated and start shouting i'll encourage you i'll start screaming with you if you rejoice i'll rejoice with you i won't shut that down but we got to come to a spot to where at some point in our preaching that the power of conviction becomes so real to where it stops us in our tracks it makes us think for a little while do you know that in some circles it would be absolutely a failure of a meeting if a man preached to seven or eight or nine hundred a thousand people and all of them got to the end of the service and just sat there and thought just sat there with their head down you know as people do maybe some with their hand over their eyes or you know those expressions and those bodily expressions when people are under that depth of conviction and if the preacher just had to stand up there and just mourn over his own bible god help me you know in certain circles around this message that would be considered a failure of a service but what is the greater failure to have a camp meeting in louisiana or winter youth retreat or some of the young people's meetings here brother tom or some other revival brother joseph has him back in murfreesboro nothing against him but is it is it a success if everybody comes up and screams and hollers and jumps and dance and then when they walk out they're living the same old way have the same old feelings that they've always had they still got bitterness they still got hatred they still got contention and they still got envy but they felt good while they was here but it didn't cause anybody to repent one of the greatest revivals i was in i was working between two churches that had split it ain't my first rodeo and these churches had bitter disagreements against each other and i happened to have enough favor with all of them with both sides to where i got service together i got to the end of the service and i started preaching about love and what it meant to love one another one of the greatest revivals i was in was when i stepped back from the platform and i said now if anybody in here really wants to serve god go to your brother and your sister right now make that thing right with them that you know ain't right one two and three and four and five and six before i know that they're standing in corners huddling together what i do i stood up and prayed for them god help them help them work it out help them sort the details help them get the feeling right in their heart and you know by the time we got to the end of that service there was such an atmosphere beginning to pour into that place then we shouted the rest of the night [Laughter] but in some circles it'd be considered a failure without if the preacher didn't pass out praying for people but whatever happened old-fashioned conviction where we just sit and thank god what is the condition of my heart you know the bible has a there's a scripture that i quote to myself a lot i quote it to people when they're trying to figure things out and make choices i quote this a lot to myself as well the bible in proverbs said ponder the direction of your feet and where they'll go what kind of service would you want to have let's just be honest i've come to help in a long time i've tried to get you wednesday night folks swinging running the backs i've done everything i can to get your worship into the best of my ability as an evangelist i'm not against people trying to be emotional getting amen and praising the lord and i'm probably going to continue hollering come on somebody i'm not giving those things up we need it and when we come to church we shouldn't have to sit there beat up and defeated we should have freedom of worship to be able to raise our hands when we feel like it sure or you ought to have that kind of liberty so yeah i encourage you to shout and amen and praise the lord and if you don't i'm probably going to scold you but it's not about the emotion in that regard it's about not letting the devil take your rights from you what really belongs to you but in some places it'd be considered a failure if we ended service and people wasn't crying and screaming but let me say it again what's wrong with the power of conviction coming so deeply so while you're sitting here in the church tonight you know there's somebody sitting here next to you that you've wronged had a feeling toward some little bitter thing that you ain't made right you want to see revival in the church go back and look at questions and answers when brother ben bryant stands up and said brother branham we knew there was a little rift in the brother and we started going to one another making it right you know what brother brown said when they were repenting each other like that he said that's real revival he called him if there's no love in this let's say there's not real love amongst the people here i'm not saying it's that way or not i'm just asking the question if you evaluated your heart and you think there's no love amongst this group why have you let your secret out have you let satan put bitterness where there used to be forgiveness if there's no real togetherness so let's say it another way if there's no gifts of the holy spirit among this body why have we let our secret out if we lost the conviction of coming to church and god if you want me to see a vision if you want me to lay hands on the sick i'm here i'm ready if there's nothing but a bunch of sin amongst this body why ask yourself the question have we let our secret out have we become so uncommitted and unconvinced that oh we're all right we're a bunch of message people we're the elite the top of the top if things exist amongst churches why don't we just stop and say why god why are we like that is it because i let my secret out is it because i failed to stay convicted that when that thing got in my heart about that sister or that brother rather than go to god and pray and say lord forgive me i just let that thing build and mount and grow and huh y'all are either quiet at me because you're mad or i've got you under conviction one of the other i'm just saying i'm not accusing i'm just asking questions this is typical stuff you could preach take this out and preach this very same thing to any church in this message i'm just using this for a point what questions could we say to ourselves we talk about all night prayings would that be great who's got time for all night prayer we got to get into the bed we're tired we got work in the morning but if we had the kind of conviction that we needed and we come into church here tonight and under a special circumstance maybe there was an emergency raised up in the church one felt it the other felt the other felt and struck like fire next thing you know people were laying on their face and their pews wherever they're at praying the next thing it was four or five o'clock in the morning they're still praying after god that doesn't mean every time you come to church to be spiritual you have to have an all-night prayer meeting but if you want to be spiritual have the conviction in your heart just say god i'm ready to do whatever it is you want me to do and be whatever it is you want me to be if you ever lose that secret delilah will shave you as sure as we're sitting here you'll lose the power and the glory and all that that should come with the church and if you're there personally or whatever you are don't forget if your gods you might have lost glory you might have lost remember the hair represents glory remember that's a woman's glory you know when uh uh brother carol used to use this all the time and a little example preaching and evangelism him and i would preach meetings together in the field i always like to come to evangelize because i hear things from brother carol we never heard at home and he would always talk about that little woman that washed his feet you know he said she took her glory and laid it at his feet i like that and this is the truth the glory of any church is the power of god in it but if satan shapes us because we lose our conviction don't forget there's still a root that can grow you just got to start praying god one more time deal with me as you used to deal with me opening my heart as i used to open it up i'm becoming sensitive like i used to that's an everyday thing if you're doing things that ain't exactly right before the lord and you're struggling with the setting of sin from moment to moment never lose that attitude or you'll lose the battle god help me keep me right god bless you now you understand me i'm not saying that you don't love one another you get that right i'm not saying you don't have powers and gifts i'm saying if we become a church like brother branham was describing here then we have to ask the self the question why take it in a different way i'm closing i'm quitting families if families aren't as close together as they used to be why one got this against it and that one against it this one got angry about that one this was before you know there's a gigantic rift between the groups they don't want to talk to each other anymore sure we have to ask ourself what happened brother brahman said a man and a woman have to love each other if they're ever going to make the grade you take that love out of that home and it'll fall apart the glory will depart from it because you realize that's why ichabod has rode over many churches because the glory of the lord has departed god help us can we buy our heads together while your heads are about this evening not trying to prolong the service but talking this way gets people thinking and that's good for some of you sitting here tonight maybe you would say within yourself brother ben i i get it i get the message i don't have the same conviction in my heart like i used to i don't take the bible that seriously or the message i seriously don't take churches seriously i don't take prayer as seriously i've just kind of become common with it but i'm asking the lord to come in tonight give me a baptism of real conviction remember if you mourn you will be comforted you will be confident would you like to raise your hand up to the lord just as a sign to him not to me so much but just god restore unto me that real conviction power hallelujah friends i'm putting my hand up right here with you because i feel there's areas of my life where i'm not as sensitive as i need to be i know i'm not i'd say just about every single hand in this building is a now is that a failure in this service because we're not screaming did we fail to move in the holy ghost no because what i'm looking at witnessing right now is a move of the holy ghost don't let the devil tell you because you're not shouting and running and dancing either the god ain't moving if you feel that convicting power inside your heart moving right now that's the baptism of holy spirit moving on you i won't pray with you right now heavenly father as we come before the sacred presence of jesus christ lord every hand in this building just about including mine was on and it's that way lord because we all sense the very same thing in this place that deep realm of conviction that deep feeling that goes right down into the soul lord it's that something god that keeps us going and keeps us moving and keeps us right with you and lord jesus as your people are setting here in the divine presence of the lord jesus christ not another god but thou alone i pray that your great holy spirit will mend and heal any place inside of them that they've damaged or left the secret of their hairs been shaved or whatever part of them that's been let out that maybe a philistine's got a hold of it or it's been shaved out lord god may it begin to grow back even now because in the little type where they asked brother branham what long hair was he said long hair was uncut hair so lord even though i may have but a little bit of stubble growing in your eyes that's a nazarite to the lord so any move i make even tonight sitting in these pews that's a move of power and conviction and it's beneficial it don't have to be long hair to the floor to be long it just has to be hair that is surrendered to you so lord if the little samsons sitting here have been shaved bald some of them lord if they're just beginning to put forth a little stubble tonight let them receive the same power same conviction same authority as though it would be hair following to the floor as it were convicted so god placed within us the blessing of conviction power help us the lord god never to lose that sensitivity father is a as a visitor slash lord i'm not even so much a visitor as much as i am almost home folk with these people here oh that's one reason why i try to preach so personal and try not to just say surface things and good one-liners i don't want to just work their emotions up lord why waste our time on these wednesday nights coming in in a rush and tired and wore out and worked all day and our mind on thousand things and then walk out the door just regular old service as it were no god let tonight be a complete restoration hallelujah a restoration and a revival of conviction in our heart granted lord in jesus name amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if you want it with all of your heart just raise your hands up like this say lord i receive it i receive it tonight lord you tell him you tell him in your own way you tell him say lord i receive it tonight i receive
