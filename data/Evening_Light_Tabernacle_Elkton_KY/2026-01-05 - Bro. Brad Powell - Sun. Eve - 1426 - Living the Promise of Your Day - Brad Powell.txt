I'm [singing] a part [music] of his word. It's a revelation [singing] of who I am. And on Calvary, he died to redeem his lost bride. The King of Kings [singing] became my Savior.

[singing] And father, I hear it growing [singing and music] louder. It's the song of your redeemed.

We praise you, Lord Jesus. We surrender all to you, Lord. Thank you, Father. Glory. Hallelujah. [applause] Man, hasn't it been a wonderful day in the Lord? &gt;&gt; I tell you what, this morning in service and and the songs and and just everything, we're just we're just grateful and thankful for what the Lord's done for us. And I just want to kind of uh re reiterate and and not to add to what Brother Ber preached this morning, but just to say how good 25 was and how much better 26 is going to be &gt;&gt; in the Lord. Amen. If you would turn in your Bibles, I want to speak just a a short sermon and if I could, I I've got probably got enough notes for uh for a couple hours here. And uh but I'm I'm going to keep it brief if we can. So, I know you're tired. You've eaten well and you've eaten well twice today. So, we'll just go for dessert. How's that? And uh I want to speak if we could living the promise of your day. And as you're turning into the book of Joshua, we will be reading out of there the book of Joshua in chapter 1. And speaking on leaving living the promise of your day, Mark Twain said this, "The two most important days of your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why." So you know you think about that quote there what he says and he's emphasizing that your birth I it it it grants your existence it brings you into this world but the second part of that when the day you find out why you were born that places you into a place that you gives you meaning to your existence &gt;&gt; so we look at that and thinking about it the prophet he says this he's talking and he says Jesus Christ is in the building tonight think about the quote I read and the quote that the prophet saying he says we're the Jesus Christ is in the building tonight to perform miracles but he does it through his church his people they shall lay their hands on the sick they shall recover in my name they shall cast out evil spirits is that right he says that's a commission given to the church that's what's the matter with the church today it doesn't know his position take it back to our title living the promise of your day &gt;&gt; he said if you know positionally listen to this. If you kned positionally who you was and what you are tonight, there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes. &gt;&gt; He says, "That's right. The thing that it is, you're looking off into a millennium somewhere for something to happen when it's already here." He said, "Now, we are the sons of God. Not we will be, but we are right now." He says, "When?" Right now. Right now. this minute we're seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. He said, "Oh, if you could only recognize that and the supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to every believer." &gt;&gt; To every believer. Anything you have desire of, any need, only thing you have to do is ask and receive it. Whatsoever you desire when you pray, believe you receive it and it'll be given unto you. Joshua. Let's read out of Joshua. We'll get you to have your seats. I want to leave you standing for a little bit because I know how it is when you sit down after a meal. So, you stand and I'll stand and we'll all just be happy. Y'all want to stand the whole service? Joshua chapter 1. Now, after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses's minister, saying, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore arise. Watch what he says. Go over this Jordan, thou and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them. Brothers and sisters, that is a promise. That is a promise that God made to the children of Israel. Now listen to what the promise is. that every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses, from the wilderness of Lebanon, even unto the great river Euphrates, to the land of the Hittites, unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. There's, now watch, there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. Now, here's the key part. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Listen to what he said. He said, "As I was with Moses, I will be with you. I will not fail you. I will not forsake you." It didn't say, "There shall not be any man able to stand before you because you are greater than Moses." No, he didn't he didn't do that. But God clearly told him how to keep things in perspective. It's not about you, Joshua. It's about me. It's about God. It's about God in our lives. &gt;&gt; And if we're going to be victorious, if we're going to be able to live the promise in our hour, we have to keep this in perspective. Turn with me quickly to Joshua chapter 3. Joshua chapter 3 7-13. And the Lord said unto Joshua, "This day will I begin to will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all of Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I you hearing me? So I will be with thee. And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are coming to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand in the Jordan." And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, "Come hither and hear the words of the Lord your God." Emphasis on the Lord your God. And Joshua said, "Hereby ye shall know, ye shall know that the living God is amongst you." Aren't you thankful tonight that a living God is amongst us? &gt;&gt; The living God in this hour is amongst us. And Joshua is telling him, "Hereby you know that the living God is amongst you and that he he he without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Persites, the Gersites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites. Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord, for of all the earth passeth before you unto Jordan. Now therefore take you 12 men out of the tribes of Israel, and out of every tribe of man. And it shall come to pass, here we are again, as soon as the souls of your feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of the all the earth shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above. All the floods going to stop. All the problems going to stop. Why? Because they got God first. &gt;&gt; And they'll stand up on a heap. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. can have your seats. Let me see what time we are. 3:00. Can we have &gt;&gt; Can we have a few minutes? I'll leave it that way. So, the prophet of God begins to tell the story here of Joshua. And and we look here and he talks about Joshua, how Joshua has been a warrior, how Joshua has been elected of God. He's been chosen of God. And he meets this king. And we think about Joshua here as he meets this king, this great man, the prophet said, was standing up next to a wall and he's standing there near Jericho. This man as a warrior and he's and Joshua now begins to see a real visible thing. Now, no doubt that the man that he saw, he he had confidence. The man that Joshua approaches, he had confidence and he could see that he he had a he had authority. This man that Joshua sees, he had he had overcoming power. He had something in his eyes that Joshua had never seen in the eyes of any man before. So, brothers and sisters, who do you think this man was standing against this wall that Joshua comes up and walking out of the wilderness from Jordan to Jericho? Who was this man? Who was this man that he had come in contact with? I hope that we have met this man in the hour that we're living that we have come in contact with a man of authority, with a man of power, with a man who overcomes all the infirmities of our lives. &gt;&gt; So you see brothers and sisters, all of us had to have a day when we were born into this world. We call it a birth day. We all have a day that we were born. But along the journey of life that is when we discover what we were born to do. It's along this journey is what we we decide or we discover what we were born for. It's along this road of life where we fall and we get back up and we fall and we get back up and we fall. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we get back up. It's in those times that we find out what our calling is. And we see Joshua here being this big chief warrior that he was. He draws his sword upon this man. Now, put yourself in this image. You just stand up and you walk up and you look into a man that you see authority like you've never seen. You see power like you've never seen. You see a man who's got who's got confidence like you've never seen before. And you're going to walk up to him and draw your sword. And he walks up and he draws his sword and he pulls it out and he says, "Who are you? &gt;&gt; Are you for us or are you against us? &gt;&gt; Do you stand with Israel or do you stand against us?" &gt;&gt; Now, I can imagine this man looks back at him with a little smirk on his face and he goes and he towers his sword over the top of Joshua's head. And as he towers his his sword up over there and lifts it high above his head, he says, "No, I am the captain of the host of the Lord God of all of Israel. Know now who you're looking for, Joshua. Know now who you're talking to. Know now whose presence you stand in." &gt;&gt; And immediately, go read. Immediately Joshua unlatches the laces off of his shoes and he falls down on his face and he falls on his face before him and says, "What would my Lord have me to do?" &gt;&gt; Oh, so many times we need to get that in our lives where we fall down and say, "What would my Lord have me to do? &gt;&gt; I only want to do, brother Ber, what he wants me to do. I only want to do and say and go and act how he wants me to act. &gt;&gt; And so that's where we fail so many times, brothers and sisters, is we get wrapped up in doing what we want to do. &gt;&gt; We get wrapped up in doing what we want to do. We get wrapped up in our jobs. We get wrapped up in in our friends. We get wrapped up in our children. Well, some of you believe me. Some of you living it. Some of you doing it. Some of you's done it. &gt;&gt; We get wrapped up in our children. Do you know we can even get so wrapped up in our spouses. Some of you's careful to say amen on that one. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we get so wrapped up in our spouses that we get so wrapped up in life that we fail to loosen the shoes on our feet and fall on our faces before God and say, "My Lord, how would you have me to live? Not my life." &gt;&gt; We're talking about priorities. &gt;&gt; We're talking about priorities. We what what did we have first in 2025? And what will we have first in 2026? &gt;&gt; Lord, how would you have me to live? I fall before you. You see, there's a saying that goes like this. If you say yes to everything, you're saying no to something. Think about that. If you say yes to everything your children want, I want to go here, daddy. I want to go this. I want to do that. I want to be a part of this. But it'll take us out of church. You said yes to your kids and no to God. I want a new job. This job that they've been offered is going to give me this big amount of money, but I'm going to have to be gone three weeks out of four. You've said yes to a career and you've said no to God. &gt;&gt; Honey, I don't want to go to that church anymore. I want to go over here. But you know, we can't be consistent if we go there because it's too far of a drive. You've said yes to honey and no to God. Well, somebody help me. &gt;&gt; If you say yes to everything, you're saying no to something. And the prophet said that Joshua when Joshua was on his face is when he was finding out his position. &gt;&gt; It wasn't when he was saying under the wings of Moses. Oh, we think that we listen to that and we we hear the stories and we know he was right there as his right-hand man. But that is not when he found out his position. He found out his position when he fell on his face and said, "Lord, what would you have me to do?" It was on his face when he found out who he was. It was on his face on the dirt when he found out what the mission plan was. It was on his face when he found out what he was born to do. On his face, he learned to trust in God. We don't like these days. We don't like to be on our face. We like to see what's coming. But it was on his face that he learned how to lead through adversities. Brothers and sisters, you realize that Joshua being one of the greatest military men that had ever been on the face of the earth, the prophet said there was never a general that could compare to the likes of Joshua. At no time, at no age, nowhere has there ever been anybody compared to the military might that Joshua was. You say, "Well, Trump just went in and got that guy." I don't care what Donald Trump just did. &gt;&gt; Well, he's going to take care of Iraq. I don't care what he's going to do. There was never anybody, no commander ever was, ever will be, ever, that will line up with the might of Joshua. You see that word Joshua, it comes from another word, another a word we know very well means Jesus. It means Jesus. It means savior. It means deliverer. But what I want us to realize tonight that even in all of his glory, we hear about the stories of Joshua and we hear about all they overcoming this and he overcome that and the walls came down and this. But in all of his glory, what I want you to realize tonight, in all of his might, Joshua was not perfect. He was not perfect at all in any of his actions. But Joshua longed for perfection. We talked about it. Brother Ber mentioned it this morning. How many wants to be perfect? Joshua longed for perfection. But as a man, he was not perfected. As a man, he was not perfect. In a as a man, he failed many times after many times after many times. And no doubt he wanted to do exactly what God wanted him to do. His desire was to be obedient. That's all of our desires. We all want to be obedient to the word of God and what God wants us to do. But he was a man just like you and just like I &gt;&gt; H plenty of faults. When we look at Joshua, we look at his faults, we see he failed many, many times and and he knew what discouragement was all about. Now, we don't think about that a lot. If I say Joshua, you think great warrior. If I say Joshua, you think overcomer. If I say Joshua, you say walls come down. If I say Joshua, you think big grapes carrying them back, overcoming promised land. We don't think about the Joshua that was disobedient. We don't think about the Joshua who got the big head. Oh, well, you you don't you don't believe me? Some of you looking at me like a a cow staring at a new gate. But that's what the word says when we go in here and look, we see what Joshua's most significant weakness occurring over and over and over was his ability to make major decisions based on his own judgment, his ideas. He wanted to conquer the world the way he wanted to conquer the world. You want this? You won't conquer a thing in yourself. &gt;&gt; You got enemies. You got fears. You got doubts. You got anxieties. You got you got oppressions. You've got habits. You've got things that you just can't overcome. You've got enemies in your life. And you say, "I want to conquer it, but I'm going to do it this way. You're setting yourself up for a long hard winter. Joshua, he begins to rely on himself. In the blink of an eye, Joshua goes from zero to hero. Think about it. &gt;&gt; He goes from zero, nothing. hadn't done anything to hero. All of a sudden, he begins to he all of a sudden the miraculous thing happens at Jericho. He goes up and he tries to tell the people. He begins to tell the people if we do this and we do this and we follow this and we go here and we do this and we shout and we walk and we march and we take the ark before us, the walls will come down. And what happened? The walls came tumbling down. Fast forward a few days. What did you Did y'all quit reading right there? The story doesn't end there. No. Joshua begins to look and he says, "Who's next on the list?" After the walls of Jericho coming down, Joshua begins to get the big head. Look in chapter 7 of Joshua. They suffer a great defeat of a city called I. The walls of Jericho came down. Maybe it was your enemy one day that came down. You said, "Oh, I praise God. I did it. I have overcome depression. I have overcome oppression. I have overcome smoking. I have overcome drinking. The walls came down and Joshua looks around and says, "Ah, look at this. This is what I was called for. I'm living the promise of my hour. I brought the walls down." H brothers and sisters, humility went out the door. &gt;&gt; Humility went out the door. Brother Ber said this morning, we got to stay humble. &gt;&gt; We got to stay humble. I didn't know what he was preaching. He didn't know what I was preaching. But I do know this. If you're going to go anywhere with God, you better stay humble before God. You better give credit where credit is due. &gt;&gt; And here is Joshua. He comes down here and he looks and he says, "Oh, I don't need to counsel God anymore." Have y'all read this story, Brother Joe? You read this story. Just shake your head. I don't need counsel anymore because I had this great victory at Jericho and I know what I'm doing now. I know how to go forward. I know. But what he failed to realize, what he failed to remember is his big victory at Jericho was not anything he done. He simply followed instruction. &gt;&gt; What God told him to do, he told them to do. &gt;&gt; It wasn't because he was great. It wasn't because the warriors were great. It was because they simply followed instruction. &gt;&gt; If you want to overcome things in your life, follow the way God said do it. &gt;&gt; If you want to get closer to God, what do you do? &gt;&gt; See, I don't have to tell you that. I don't have to preach that to you. You know what to do. &gt;&gt; And Joshua looks out here and he says, "Who's next? Who's next on the list? Who shall we destroy today? I I Joshua is the next city in the way. Where is I? Who is I? How big is I? And Joshua begins to send the the men of Jericho down to the city of I. And he says, "Go down there into the country and I want you to look and tell me about this city I." And the men come back and they go down or they go down there and they begin to look at the city. They begin to survey it all out and they go down there and they come back and they tell him, "Joshua, there's no need in sending many people up there. There's no need in sending a bunch of people up there. Let the people rest. We can just send about 3,000 men up there. Didn't you see what we did to that city of Jericho? 3,000 of our men can take this little town out with no problem." And Joshua says, "Okay, sounds good. Let's do it. In the Bible, nowhere it says does it say he talked to God about it. Nowhere in the Bible does it say he prayed about it. Nowhere in the Bible does it say he he he got himself before God and fell before God and said, "God, how should we handle this?" But he said, "I'll take it upon ourselves. We'll take our men and we'll go down there." And there was about 12,000 men in the city of I. And they go down there. We s Josh Joshua sends 3,000 men and the men of I run them out of the city the gates and kill 36 of God's men. Yeah. Brothers and sisters, now the people's hearts, the Bible says that the heart of the people melted and it became as water. These are the same people that I thought was victorious. These are the same people I thought that was right there at the city of the walls of Jericho came down and they shouted and they danced and they screamed and they praised God and thank God for all that he's done. And now it says that their their their very hearts had melted and became his water. So now, brothers and sisters, here they stand defeated. A once victorious army now lays before their own people defeated. &gt;&gt; No more shout, no more victory. All because they overcome one enemy and failed to give God the praise. Come on, church. And failed to give God the glory. Now the little enemies are starting to build up. Jericho was a big place. They took it down pretty easily with the word of God. But in man's eyes, in man's might, in man's will and way, they can't even overcome a little bitty city maybe the size of Elton. And the Bible tells us that Joshua now rinse his clothes. And Joshua rinse his clothes and he falls on the his face before the ark of the Lord. Now watch what Joshua does. This is just the human nature. This is the way we all will react. And Joshua comes down. He says, "Ah Lord God, why hast thou? Why hast thou brought us people, the people over the River Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites and destroy us?" So now Joshua is blaming God. It's your fault. Listen, God, it's your fault. You're the one who done this. You let this happen. You brought us over here. Are you with me? And Joshua goes on to say, "What to God? We'd have been content to dwell on the other side, Lord. We would have been happy to dwell on the outskirts of the Jordan, but here you are. You made us all of these promises. You told us all about this land with milk and honey. You told us about all these deliverers we all the deliverance we could have. You told us about all this overcoming power. You told us that all things could be ours and whatever we ask would be in our hands. You told us that we would live a life of plenty. Huh? Lord, but this is hard. We can't do this, Lord. Now, everyone knows how weak we are and they're going to war against us. Look at us now, Lord. We lay here defeated. Lord, you broke your promise. Can you imagine the good things that God has done in our lives? The good things that God has done in our lives. And then we fail to realize, we fail to praise. We fail to give God glory. And all of a sudden, we stand defeated because we can't even get over a toothache. &gt;&gt; I promise we're going to get on the victorious side in a minute. Because I tell you what, God don't bring us this far to lose us. &gt;&gt; God will never bring you to a place and say, "Oh, you've you've accomplished all you can in the word and now it's done here." God does not put a period after his promises. But we keep growing. We keep growing. We keep developing. We keep maturing. Thank God. &gt;&gt; We keep getting better and better in God. But see, but Joshua let self get in the way. He let self get in the way. And the victory that came at Jericho was all forgotten about. Let me ask you, what was your victory 15 years ago on this date? You see what I mean? How quick, how quick we fail to remember all the goodness of God. How quick we fail to realize that all the good things in our life come from him. 2025 was a good year because this church put God first. If you want 2026 to be a good year in your home, in your job, in your life, in your children, in our church, put God first. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Joshua's sitting here wallering around like a hog in the waller, crying, pouting, whining. And the Lord looks at Joshua and he says, "Get up." &gt;&gt; Get thee up. Wherefore lies thou up on thy face? Listen to me. Follow me. He said, "Take counsel from me. Get up. Quit laying around. Quit trying to do things your way. Quit trying to do things the way you want to do it and listen to me. Follow me. Put me first in the battles. Let me go before you. You crossed the river when the ark went first. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we just have to be reminded. Joshua kind of had to be reminded. Joshua, don't you remember that big bunch of grapes that you brought back on your back for the evidence? Don't you remember Joshua marching down there with those grapes on your soldiers on your shoulder soul shoulders singing uh the songs of Jubilee? Don't you remember going down there and singing we are able to go up and take the country to possess the land from Jordan to the sea. Though the giants may be in our way to hinder, our God has promised us the what? &gt;&gt; Victory. [applause] &gt;&gt; God said, "Remember who you are, Joshua. Remember what you were born to do. Remember the day that you were born and remember the day that you fell on your face and I told you what you were born to do. You see, just because we fall, just because we fall today don't mean we're lost tomorrow. Just because we're defeated today doesn't mean you that that you allow the devil to steal your victory. Because tough times makes tough people. And tough times never last, but tough people do. Everywhere the souls of your feet trod, you shall possess it. I'm going to change gears here for just a little bit. I'm going to share some stories with you, some modernday stories of overcoming power. There was a man, a gentleman by the name of Richard Norris William II, born in 1891. Norris Williams was an American tennis player. At the age of 12, he began to start playing tennis. He began to get direction under his dad. He began to excel in tennis. You say, "What's this got to do with Joshua?" He had to realize who he was. He had to realize exactly what he would what he was called to do and how he would have to overcome obstacle after obstacle after obstacle. Norris Williams and his father in the in the month of April of 1912. Does that name does that date and that month sound familiar to any of you? They boarded a ship called the Titanic. Norris Williams and his dad boarded a ship called the the Titanic. And as they sailing across the sea, we know the story. The Titanic hit the iceberg. The iceberg pierced the side. The Titanic began its final plunge. As the ship begins to go down, Norris Williams is going through the bunkheads of the of the ship there. And he sees people locked behind doors. He breaks down the doors and releases those people to their freedom. One of the stewards on there said, "You will be charged for this. You're going to have to pay for this." Very familiar scene in the story in the movie Titanic. That was Richard or that was Norris Williams that they were talking about. As Williams gets on the Titanic and he begins to him and his father they jump and they bail off of the ship of the Titanic and they enter into the icy sea. Him and his father's out there and in just a moment one of the smoke stacks begins to come tumbling down and it falls and lands right on his father and he sits there and he begins to look at this and he said, "I saw one of those great funnels come crashing down on top of him and just for an instance I stood there transfixed. I stood there as I saw it crashing down. Not because it had missed me by a few feet, but curiously and not because it had killed my father, but because of the I was transfixed of the enormous size of this funnel, still belching smoke. He said, "It seemed as two cars could have driven side by side in it as it made its way to me." He struggles to swim in the icy sea. Finally, he grabs a hold of a lifeboat. And for hours, after grabbing a hold of the lifeboat, no room for him inside the boat. He hangs on over the edge. And for hours and hours, his legs are left out there into the freezing waters. Finally, a ship, the Carpathia, arrives. The Carpathia comes and arrives and and comes and picks up all the survivors. and they're they're going through there and they're they're pulling them in and they call him in and they say, "Listen, your legs are so severely frostbitten. You will never walk again." Footsteps means possession. Think about this. You will never walk again. It is an absolute must that we amputate your legs. He said, "No, I'm going to walk." And day after day, he would take a step wobbling on his legs so severely frostbitten, black and and rotten and looked like appeared to be rotten in a way. And he would take a step and a little step here and a little step there and another little step and another little step. And he began to possess He began to walk and he began to possess. Are you with me? The doctor said, "You'll never walk. We have to amputate." That's what Satan wants to do sometimes. He'll tell you, "You can't have your victory. You just might as well cut it off right now." &gt;&gt; And Satan wants to amputate what God has already given you. This man was a God-gifted, talented tennis playing athlete. Don't cut my legs off. And he walks step after step after step. Did you think he ever played tennis again? 1912, not soon after the accident, after the Titanic sinks, and after he begins to regain his strength, after he begins to take step after step after step, and he says, "I was born to play tennis. I was born to live this kind of life. We were born to be Christians. We were born to possess the gates of our enemy. We were born to be overcomers." This man begins to take these steps and in the same year of 1912 he defeated eighttime champion Wallace Johnson and he began to win again in 1914. He became a multiple time multiple time multiple time tennis champion. &gt;&gt; I'm not listening to the devil &gt;&gt; this year. I'm not listening to the devil. When he says I you can't have this, I'm going to say you watch me go get it. When he tells me I can't have victory, when he tells me I I can't have uh happiness in my life, I'm going to say, "Devil, you watch me. I'm going to go get it." at the age of uh at the age of 33 in the 1924 Olympics. He's playing in a tennis match and he severely sprains his ankle. They tell him say, "You're going to have to withdraw from the match. You're going to do more damage than if you were to get out. Just just get out. You're going to do more damage. You're going to hurt yourself more." He says, "I'm not going to stop playing tennis. just over a little sprained ankle. And he began to keep going and he began going and he won the gold medal in the mixed doubles on a severely sprained ankle. He knew what he was born to do. And you say, "Well, that's a tennis player. How much more should it apply to us as Christians? How much more victorious should we be? We shouldn't let a little hurt feeling keep us out of church. We shouldn't let a little poor attitude keep us out of church. She was born prematurely at 4 lb and 5 oz in the summer of 1940 in St. Bethlehem, Tennessee. Many of you drive daily down a road that's named after her. You ever heard of Wilma Rudolph? Wilma Rudolph was born. She had several childhood illnesses. She had pneumonia. She had scarlet fever. She had contacted infantile paral paralyzis caused by polio virus. Her legs were in braces most of her life. They said she would never walk again. Think about this. They said she would never walk again. She would be physically disabled much of her life. Leg brace. 12 years old in leg braces. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; medical facilities wouldn't take care of African-American black black people at that time in the 1940s. So there she was. She knew who she was, but what was she born to do? You mean to tell me this young little girl who has who has par paralysis in the legs? A young little girl who's wearing braces. You mean to tell me she was born to run? It don't make sense. But she knew who she was. She loved basketball. She loved track and field. She loved to do all those things. And she began to little by little her parents would take her all the way to Nashville to a hospital that would take care of black people. black children. They would come home and they would spend two or three trips a week to go to Nashville and they would prescribe her therapy and massage her legs and massage her legs and say, "Walk a little more. Walk a little more. Possess what you want." Come on, church. We need to exercise some of our muscles. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we set paralyzed in church, not willing to take a step or make a move. take another step, make another move. And they begin to massage her legs and massage her legs. And week after week after week, she began to take these treatments. The head coach of Temple seen her playing basketball as a 14y old two years after she's in leg braces. and he looked at her and instantly said, "That girl was a born athlete." He invited her to come to the summer program at Tennessee State. He invited her to come to the track camp. And there as a 14-year-old, she won all nine events in the amateur athletic union, the AAU events. She won all nine events. and she went to Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania under his guidance and she began to run with the track team. She was then invited to go to the 1956 Olympics as a 16year-old girl who four years earlier was embraces. Sometimes we let our complexes hold us back. We allow our complexes to hold us back. we allowed them to keep us from doing the things that we were called to do. &gt;&gt; What if What if the preachers allowed the complex of be getting up in front of people? What if they allowed that complex to hold them back and not do what they were told to do? &gt;&gt; What if you allowed the complex of getting up in front of people and not singing kept you from doing what God called you to do? She began to run and she began to run and she began to run over and over and over. She won medal after medal after medal. Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. She's become one of the She is the most one of the most decorated females in Olympic track history. Statues have been made after her. Buildings have been named after her. University coliseums have been named after her. How could that happen? How could some little teenage girl who had so many setbacks and become a household name? Because she stood on the promises of what she was, of what God made her to be. Some of us need to accept what God wants us to do in our hour and in our lives. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, why is this church here so much on fire? because a few because a few decided to take a stand and do what God called them to do. &gt;&gt; You know, I I hate to call people out, but I like to give roses where roses are due. &gt;&gt; We listen to the testimony of Brother Tommy. Jo, she said, "I'm glad you got Tommy." I said, "I am too." Tommy texts me about every day, sends me pictures of his breakfast, his lunch, his supper. He sent me a plate of food last night. Uh, steak, potatoes, beans. I don't know what I was on. I said, "Man, that ain't right." I said, "I just ate peanut butter and crackers." And you say, "Well, y'all sure talk a lot about Tommy." Well, let me tell you about Tommy. Tommy has taken and and became and got a boldness in his heart. &gt;&gt; And he's be to take that boldness that God called him with, and he's be to take that boldness and he shares it out into the out into the community. He takes it into the prisons. Now, he didn't do it all by himself. Now, he's got a team. He's be &gt;&gt; And good things are happening. &gt;&gt; Good things are coming of it. But let me tell you this, maybe he won't tell you, but there was a time he told me. He said, I'm I'm quitting this. Am I right? He said, I I don't have no nobody comes. No, there's no outcome. People are starting to dwindle away at the prison. We started out with several, but then last time it was about just a few, maybe six or seven. This is my last day. Let's don't tell God what we're going to do. Let's say, God, is this my last day? &gt;&gt; Because he shows up at the prison on his last day when he's fixing to announce, "I'm done with this. We're not coming back." And how many was there? 20 something. 30. 21. Thank you, brother Glenn. 21 shows up, the biggest crowd they've had. And they they show up there, 21 of them. And he says, "I'll see y'all next week." [clears throat] 21 of them. [applause] They pray together, they sing together, they talk about the word, they bring in the Lord. Now, the prison won't let him come in and bring in message, but God has given him a gift and he can recall. I said, "Man, I wish I could recall like Tommy." He gets to preach it to me. I said, "Man, won't you here? Just take this and go." And that little fire spread here and here and there and there and there and there. We got a group of people that's in action. We got a group of people that is allowing God to move into their lives. That's how it happens. You got to stand on what you know that God is doing in your life. &gt;&gt; Use me, oh Lord. Lord, what would you have me to do? Be a Joshua. Be a Joshua. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're not a Tommy. Maybe you're not a Maybe you're not a brother Thomas. Maybe you're not a brother Brad. Maybe you're not Maybe you're not a singer. Maybe you're not this. But what has God called you to do? &gt;&gt; You see, you can have a job. You can make the most money than anybody in this building. But if you're not doing what God wants you to do, it's all in vain. &gt;&gt; Your money means nothing to God. Do you know that? He doesn't need it. He don't want your money. He wants your heart. &gt;&gt; He wants a living vessel, somebody that he can use, somebody that he can move through. &gt;&gt; And sometimes the avenues we have to take to get there is not always a fun way. It's not always a fun road. April the 17th, 2018, Southwest Flight 1380 was climbing towards cruising altitude when the left engine detonated with such a force that the captain Tammy Joe Schultz thought they collided with another aircraft. Metal shrapnel gum. It pierces through the fuselage. The window seat 14A exploded. The cabin depressurized. One of the passengers was pulled out of the opening and the others grabs a hold of her and begins to pull her back in. Oxygen mass drop. This is our worst nightmare when we get on a plane, right? The oxygen mass drop. They drop down there and the plane rolls violently and it pitched into a dive and smoke begins to fill the cockpit. Passengers are now terrified and they're typing their final messages out to their families. Chaos in the sky. Tammy Joe Schultz picks up the radio. Captain Schultz in a calm voice says, "This is Southwest. This is Southwest 1380. We're a single engine. We're a single engine and we have part of the aircraft missing. So, we're going to need to slow down a bit. That's her quote. This is air traffic control documented communication. We've lost part of our airplane. We're going to have to slow down just a little bit. Air traffic controllers, they couldn't believe what they were hearing. While 148 people are fighting full of full of terror, she's up there flying the aircraft. She's up there just flying along. what they what it seemed impossible. It wasn't luck. It wasn't look. She was forged through 30 years of being told she didn't belong in an airplane. Listen to what I'm telling you. 30 years she'd been told you don't belong in an airplane. For 30 years she'd been told women don't fly. For 30 years they said women cannot fly jets. Some of us could say, "For 30 years, the devil's told me I can't do this." &gt;&gt; For 30 years, the devil has told me I can't overcome this habit. &gt;&gt; For 30 years, the devil's told me I can't quit drinking. For 30 years, the devil's told me I can't quit smoking. For 30 years, the devil's told me I can't stop pornography. &gt;&gt; She goes to aviation school. growing up watching the the fighter jets over her over her place in New Mexico. And she goes to aviation school and she shows up at the lecture and she pulls up in there and the guy says or she says, "I want to be a pilot." And he tells her the truth and she says, "There are no professional women pilots. Girls don't fly jets. Military don't want you." Huh? Has the devil ever told you God don't want you? Some of you is honest. The devil sometimes tells us these things. The Air Force rejected her three different times. Navy told her she'd never score enough because she wasn't a man. Her standards were higher for most women, and she took a full year to find a recruit willing to submit her paperwork because she knew in her heart she was good enough. You say, "What's this got to do with Joshua?" It's got a lot to do with Joshua. It's about us finding our position. It's about us living out the promises of our hour. &gt;&gt; She became one of the first women to fly an FA18 Hornet in the US Navy. You think, man, she's arrived. And that's the way we do a lot of times. The devil tell you can't do this, you can't do that. And the next thing you know, you get it, you overcome it, and you say, I've arrived. her first assignment to hum humiliate her. Her officer refused to let her teach aerial gunnery. You know where they go up and they dog fight and they shoot and they do the all. You know, you've seen it. Some of you seen Top Gun years ago. Some of you's in that danger zone. But they said you can't do that. So here, in order to to re to to humiliate her as a as a form of punishment and a way to si sideline her, they tell her, "For a year, you're going to go teach pilots how to recover aircraft from spins, dives, and catastrophic failures. I want her flying my plane." This was a lesson in her life that was born from discrimination. This was a lesson in her life that would save 148 lives. When that engine exploded 25 years later, warning lights flood the panel of her plane. Can you imagine the the red lights and she's descending at 20,000 ft in a minute? We've lost an air. We've lost an engine. We're going to have to slow down a little bit. She comes in here, one engine gone, the fuselage torn open. She lands the plane. Medics come down to check her after the landing. They check her vital signs and they said her vital signs and her heart rate were barely elevated. You see, sometimes the devil tries to humiliate us. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we go through things that we think, man, why am I going through this? But God has a perfect a a plan. God has a purpose and it's a perfect purpose and a plan in our lives. It's up to us to live the promise that God has given us. 148 people. They didn't rush her off the airplane. She went from passenger to passenger to passenger and hugged them and said, "Thank you for flying with us today." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They probably said, "Hallelujah. Thank you for landing us today." I'm going to stay true to my word less than an hour. I don't think I said that, but that's what I was thinking. Joshua Joshua a leader. Joshua led first in the wilderness where there was thousands times 10 thousands and thousands of noble men. But the prophet said Joshua seemed to realize who he was and he found out that he was positionally he was elected of God. Brothers and sisters, it is a privilege for us to stand up here before you because I feel like every time we stand up and preach, it's a privilege because I am standing to the positionally placed elected bride of Jesus Christ. And when you realize who you are, and when you realize what you were called to do, and you realize that you wasn't born without a purpose, but that God has something for you, you're more than a conqueror. Your life is victorious. Musicians, won't you come up this morning or this evening? Joshua positionally placed and elected of God. As I was with Moses, so will I be with you. And no man shall stand before you all the days of your life, neither be discouraged. Why? For the Lord thy God is with thee. It's not you. It's not me. It's him through me. It's him through you. There's our victory. And when the it seems like the devil's tried to cut off every avenue and he's cut off your legs, he's cut off your feet. He's cut off any way you have to get victory. Just keep walking. When it feels like life's so cold and you're so numb because you've been hanging on the side of that lifeboat for so long, just keep walking. Let's stand if we could. Let's just bow our heads if we could. Sister Becky, won't you play that song through it all? Had come to me a little bit ago. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we come to you this afternoon, Lord, and with this little message. Trust it is a message of hope, a message of deliverance, message of overcoming. As we hear about Joshua, your servant, how he was born, but he was more than born just a man. He was born with a purpose. And Lord, as we look at our lives and we see what you're doing in our church and in our homes and our lives, we have to realize that we were born more than just to be a a vessel on this earth, but we were born with a purpose. We were born with something for you to do in our lives, Lord. and we raise our hands and we lift our our our hearts to you and and and and bow before you, Lord, and say, "Lord, whatever it is you would have me to be. Whatever it is you would have me to do, Lord, tell me. Use me. Where you want me to go, I'll go. What you want me to say, I'll say. What you want me to sing, I'll sing. If you want me to preach, I'll preach. If you want me to to just be an encouragement, I'll be an encouragement. If you want me to clean the bathroom stalls, I'll clean the bathroom stalls. And Lord, what? No matter what I go through in life, no matter what 2026 brings or whatever we went through in 2025, through it all, we find out that our trials make us strong. And Lord, through the trials, through the battles, every little victory we get, we'll give you praise. Every time that we that we overcome a little challenge, we'll give you praise. Any obstacle is placed before us, we'll ask you how to get around it, Lord, because we're dependent upon you, Lord. We love you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. We give [music] you honor, praise, and glory, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Oh, through it all. [singing] Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in [music and singing] God. Through it all. [music] Through it all, [singing] I've learned to depend [music] upon his word. Let's sing it once again. Through it all. Oh, through [singing] it all. [music] Through it all, I've learned to trust in [music] Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through [singing] it all, [music] through it all, I've learned [music] to depend upon his word. Well, I thank God for the mountains. Well, I thank God [music and singing] for the mountains. And I thank him for the valleys. [singing] And I thank him for [music] the storms he's brought me through. For if I'd never had a problem, I wouldn't [singing and music] know that God could solve them. I'd never know [music] what faith in God [singing] could do through it all. Now let's say to him, oh through it [singing] all. [music] Oh, through it all, I've [music and singing] learned to trust in Jesus. Oh, I've learned to trust in [music and singing] God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend [singing] upon his [music] word. Through it all, [singing and music] through it all, I've learned to trust in [music] Jesus. I've learned to trust in [singing] God. Through it all, through it all, [music] I've learned to depend [music and singing] upon his word. Aren't you thankful you can depend on that word? We're just going to keep walking. We're just going to keep believing. No matter what happens, no matter what we got to go through, it's in him. It's in his word. Let's sing [music] that song. Let's change the pace. Walking up the King's Highway. It's a highway to [singing and music] heaven. None can walk up there. Oh, but the [singing] pure and heart. It's a highway to [singing and music] heaven. I'm walking up the king's highway. If you're not walking, oh, if you're [singing] not [music] walking, start while I'm talking. Walking [music] up the king's highway. And there's joy in knowing with him I'm going. [music] I'm walking up the king's highway. [singing] My way gets brighter. [music] My way gets brighter. [singing] My low gets lighter. [music] Walking up the king's [singing] highway. If you're confessing, there is a [music and singing] blessing. We're walking up the king's highway. It's a highway to heaven. Oh, it's a highway to [singing] heaven. None can walk up there, but the pure [singing] in heart. It's a highway to heaven.
