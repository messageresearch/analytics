[22:04] down into the
[22:13] pit draw me not away with the Wicked
[22:16] with the workers of iniquity which speak
[22:18] peace to their neighbors but Mischief is
[22:20] in their hearts
[22:33] because they regard not the works of the

[23:10] seated brother Steve
[23:30] just wanted to announce the results from
[23:33] the vote we had all the offices will
[23:37] remain the same that they have been so
[23:41] and I know I've never
[23:43] explained how we do that uh I'm the only
[23:48] one that sees the
[23:51] ballots uh nobody else
[23:54] does and they are put in a envelope and
[23:57] sealed up up and if if there's any
[24:02] questions they'll be able to anybody can
[24:05] ask you know to see them it's not but we
[24:08] have them sealed up nobody has ever
[24:11] asked but I read through everybody's
[24:15] ballot and
[24:17] uh any suggestions that I can help
[24:21] with I try to do that and so there have
[24:25] been some good ones this year uh and and
[24:28] I'm going to try to step up my game and
[24:31] uh be able to to do better at what I'm
[24:35] supposed to do and if there's anything
[24:38] that brother Thomas needs to address I
[24:41] go to him with that but other than that
[24:44] nobody ever sees anything is turned in
[24:48] uh it's it's just kept it's kept quiet
[24:51] and I think it's how it should be uh but
[24:54] I appreciate each one of you that did
[24:56] vote and uh and everything because we're
[25:00] we're here as a group and and that's
[25:03] what keeps everything together Amen
[25:06] brother
[25:15] Brian morning brothers and
[25:19] sisters if you turn with me to
[25:23] uh you have to forgive me on the change
[25:26] of seasons got me going Clos aans the
[25:28] third
[25:31] chapter but I was uh thinking this
[25:36] morning you know the world you know we
[25:39] talk a lot about the world in its
[25:41] current condition but it is a crazy
[25:43] place this morning and the world could
[25:47] you know it's so crazy that the way we
[25:50] live right now it could be different
[25:52] when we wake up tomorrow morning and
[25:54] like brother Thomas was preaching on
[25:58] Wednesday and Sunday and all the other
[26:00] brothers it's really important that your
[26:03] first love your first commitment is to
[26:05] Jesus Christ this morning and I was just
[26:08] thinking you know waking up this morning
[26:10] I guess you all people know in the last
[26:12] couple of days they've been killing
[26:14] Christians in Syria and I sometimes As
[26:17] Americans we take for granted our
[26:20] religious Liberties that we have in this
[26:22] country not
[26:23] realizing the the way our brothers and
[26:26] sisters some places in the world are
[26:28] persecuted they're killed they're driven
[26:31] out of their homes and their places that
[26:33] they live and and we have you know we
[26:36] have more than enough where we live and
[26:38] it's hard to imagine what it's like for
[26:40] them but I was just thinking you know
[26:42] that you know there's a there's a a
[26:45] thought you know in in any society they
[26:48] say you're you hear them say for us here
[26:51] in Kentucky would take longer but if you
[26:53] live in a city they'll tell you you're
[26:55] only 3 meals away from Anarchy
[26:59] so when people can't eat and they can't
[27:01] drink fresh water you'd be surprised
[27:04] what your neighbor will do to you just
[27:05] to keep himself alive in the morning and
[27:08] and I as I wake up every morning I was
[27:10] listening to brother brandom you know as
[27:13] I get older doing time changes isn't the
[27:16] easiest thing to do but I was listening
[27:18] to his message a couple of these
[27:21] messages last night and it really struck
[27:24] me that um it's really important that
[27:27] everything we you is dedicated to Jesus
[27:30] Christ this morning and I was just
[27:32] thinking all our brothers and sisters in
[27:34] the religious world are celebrating the
[27:37] lent season and I was just thinking you
[27:39] know it's more than just a season you
[27:42] should be sacrificing your prayer life
[27:46] and your physical body every day for the
[27:48] Lord it shouldn't be just a certain
[27:50] season in the year but I was reading
[27:53] this I'll just read a few scriptures
[27:56] this morning out of Colossians the third
[28:00] chapter yall have to forgive my
[28:04] voice and I'll just read a few verses
[28:08] here I'll say something but you all
[28:10] probably think I do this every Sunday
[28:11] morning anyway but
[28:15] um if you then be it's a third chapter
[28:18] first verse I know I don't give you all
[28:20] time sometimes to get to where you need
[28:22] to be uh if you then be risen with
[28:25] Christ seek those things which are above
[28:27] where where Christ sth on the right hand
[28:29] of God and it goes to what I was just
[28:31] saying a little bit
[28:33] early if it's if your heart has been
[28:35] changed and your life has been changed
[28:38] when you wake up in the morning you're
[28:39] going to seek those things that glorify
[28:42] the Lord every day doesn't mean you
[28:44] don't do your your daily work J job that
[28:47] you got to do there's we all got things
[28:49] we got to do every day but we're more
[28:52] than that we're more than that we're
[28:54] Christians we should be wanting to push
[28:57] the wow as they say for this this time
[29:01] that we're in he goes on to say set your
[29:03] affections on things above and on not on
[29:06] the things of
[29:08] Earth excuse me and then it goes for you
[29:12] are dead and your life is hid with
[29:14] Christ and God and what I'm going to
[29:16] read from the voice of God this morning
[29:19] kind of speaks to
[29:20] this when Christ who is our life shall
[29:23] appear then shall we also appear with
[29:25] him in glory mortify there
[29:29] Therefore your members which are upon
[29:31] the
[29:32] Earth which are upon the Earth
[29:34] fornication uncleanness ordant affection
[29:37] evil forgive my pronounce compass and
[29:41] Covetous which is so he's saying flee
[29:44] all those things for which things sake
[29:46] the wrath of God cometh on the children
[29:48] of
[29:49] Disobedience and I'm probably going to
[29:51] just read what Colossians has to say
[29:53] this morning and then it says here
[29:58] in which we also walked the same time
[30:00] and lived in them so we you know we've
[30:02] all made mistakes we all all lived in
[30:04] their bad aspects of our life but it's
[30:08] by the grace of God that we we're able
[30:10] to stand this morning as redeemed in the
[30:12] lord it's nothing we did it's nothing
[30:14] that makes us better than anyone else
[30:16] it's just something that God did for us
[30:18] because he loved us you don't have to
[30:20] you don't have to struggle for it you
[30:21] don't have to fight for it all you
[30:24] simply have to do is let go and let God
[30:26] do it and he goes on to say year I lost
[30:29] my
[30:30] place uh at the eth verse it says but
[30:32] now you also put off all these anger and
[30:36] I as I get older I find I know I say
[30:39] this but I find myself waking up
[30:41] sometimes in the morning you know we all
[30:43] have in our family we all have
[30:45] attributes and I say and Janette hears
[30:48] me say it sometimes I I think I'm
[30:50] becoming more of my father every morning
[30:52] as I get older and I don't want to be
[30:55] what my father was when he was in his
[30:56] 60s and 70s I I find myself saying that
[31:00] to myself and he goes on
[31:03] and for we know we put off all these
[31:05] anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy
[31:08] Communications out of your mouth lie not
[31:11] one to another seeing that you have put
[31:14] off the old man with his
[31:15] deeds and I put on the new man which is
[31:18] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[31:21] him that created
[31:23] him wherefore there is neither Greek or
[31:25] Jew circumcision or uncircum cision and
[31:28] I'll finish there and read this because
[31:31] I'm having a hard time breathing this
[31:33] morning but this is with on the
[31:36] uh on the uh brother on the uh voice of
[31:41] God thing this morning this this quote
[31:43] kind of speaks for the time of we're in
[31:45] right now this is what brother brandham
[31:47] had to say in this
[31:49] message excuse me here everything on
[31:52] Earth the beauty the
[31:54] sweetness excuse me the Earth nothing
[31:58] there's nothing else in the world but an
[32:00] answer to a far better than that that
[32:04] awaits us when we leave the world so
[32:06] he's going to say that everything that
[32:08] we see here that's good in the world the
[32:10] trees the animals the birds the the
[32:14] scenery that's just a type of what's
[32:16] waiting for us on the other side this
[32:18] morning and he goes on this when we
[32:21] leave this world for everything in the
[32:23] earth is just a pattern of which is in
[32:25] heaven as and that's really true
[32:28] everything that's good everything that's
[32:30] righteous and that goes back to the
[32:32] scriptures there everything that's
[32:34] beautiful that goes this you could take
[32:36] this quote and go back to Philippians
[32:38] the 3D and fourth chapter and and he
[32:41] goes beautiful trees Birds everything
[32:43] it's just a pattern of what's in heaven
[32:45] and as you wake up in the
[32:47] morning and you start a new day all the
[32:50] goodness in life that's a pattern of
[32:52] what's going to be on the other side and
[32:54] it should make you want to desire it
[32:55] more and he goes on our own life life is
[32:58] just a pattern it's just a shadow not
[33:00] the real thing it's a negative side it
[33:03] takes death to develop picture and you
[33:05] all heard brother banam talk about this
[33:07] in Preachers for years you know God has
[33:10] a snapshot of you from the foundation of
[33:13] the world and that's what you're what
[33:15] you're maturing into this this morning
[33:18] what God how God seen you in the
[33:20] foundation of the world and he goes on
[33:22] to say it takes death to develop the
[33:24] picture to put us back into thop with
[33:27] came from and then in Resurrection we
[33:30] come in his likeness a resurrected body
[33:33] what a be excuse me what a beautiful not
[33:35] only beautiful but it this real solemn
[33:38] truth of God Eternal world word that we
[33:41] want to be like him and I was just
[33:43] thinking this
[33:45] morning as I read in
[33:49] Colossians and I wrote some notes down
[33:51] here but I'm not going to get into them
[33:53] because I'm have a hard time talking
[33:55] right now but I would say as I wake as I
[33:57] get older as I wake up every morning is
[34:01] it realer to me this morning than it was
[34:04] yesterday morning is God closer to me
[34:06] today than he was yesterday and I find
[34:09] myself you know sometimes we get all
[34:11] caught up in the things of this life and
[34:13] we really don't put the important things
[34:15] first in our lives and as we come
[34:18] further
[34:19] in excuse me as we come further into
[34:23] this year this time as the world's just
[34:26] going crazy out there the church is
[34:28] going crazy but you all have a
[34:30] foundation this morning where you don't
[34:32] have no worries you don't have to worry
[34:34] about it if you put in your trust in him
[34:36] this morning so I would simply say
[34:39] that it's not important whatever you're
[34:42] holding on to that you can't bring
[34:44] through God's word it's not important
[34:46] you you need to let It Go Don't hold on
[34:48] to it whatever it is I can only speak
[34:50] for myself if it can't go through God's
[34:53] word or go through the message of the
[34:54] hour then we just got to let it go and
[34:57] let God have way in our hearts and lives
[34:59] this morning

[1:04:24] we're Lord just want to be wise enough
[1:04:26] father to talk to you the author of the
[1:04:29] book first before we open the word Lord
[1:04:31] Jesus and we ask God that you would help
[1:04:34] us to understand Lord Jesus that any
[1:04:36] human being as your Prophet has taught
[1:04:38] us can turn back the pages of this Bible
[1:04:40] anybody can open it Lord but father
[1:04:43] truly it takes your Holy Spirit to
[1:04:45] reveal it to us and to make it real in
[1:04:48] our lives Lord that's what we want above
[1:04:50] everything is the reality of the word
[1:04:52] the reality of God that we all know EX
[1:04:55] exists and that is alive and well we
[1:04:58] want the reality of that Living God in
[1:05:00] our hearts in our lives father so that
[1:05:02] we could bring it right down to where we
[1:05:04] live Lord for what is a god that is a
[1:05:07] god of somebody else or somewhere else
[1:05:10] if we don't know him personally Lord and
[1:05:12] we just ask God that you'll just bring
[1:05:14] personal revelation of yourself today
[1:05:16] bless the meditation of our heart the
[1:05:18] Direction Lord we have we have felt led
[1:05:20] to go Lord with your word this morning
[1:05:22] now we commit ourselves to you now in
[1:05:24] Jesus name amen amen and amen amen all
[1:05:28] right we're going to start with
[1:05:29] Revelations if you will The Book of
[1:05:31] Revelations we want to start
[1:05:34] with Revelations
[1:05:36] 4 don't have very many scriptures this
[1:05:39] morning but
[1:05:49] amen
[1:05:52] amen you know I ran across this quote
[1:05:55] preaching preaching on Comm andine and
[1:05:57] and Jesus having a TBL spread we talked
[1:05:59] a little bit about how we all love good
[1:06:01] food and brother baham says it this way
[1:06:03] he said all the natural are types of the
[1:06:06] spiritual like we had good food that we
[1:06:09] eat at our table it's a type of the good
[1:06:11] food that we eat from the word amen
[1:06:15] praise the Lord I always like to see
[1:06:16] that whenever you preach on something
[1:06:18] amen and read it and realize that it's
[1:06:20] certainly backed up with what the
[1:06:22] prophet said amen Revelations the 4th
[1:06:25] chapter very familiar scripture for us
[1:06:27] and verse will begin with
[1:06:33] um
[1:06:38] verse six six and Before the Throne
[1:06:42] there was a sea of glass like into
[1:06:44] Crystal and in the midst of the throne
[1:06:46] and round about The Throne were four
[1:06:48] beasts full of eyes before and behind
[1:06:52] and the first Beast was like a lion and
[1:06:54] the second beast like like a calf and
[1:06:57] the third Beast was like the face of a
[1:06:58] man and the fourth Beast was like a
[1:07:01] flying eagle and for the and the four
[1:07:04] beasts had each of them six wings I'm
[1:07:07] going to move this down a little bit
[1:07:09] each of them six wings about them and
[1:07:11] they are full of eyes within and they
[1:07:15] rest not day nor night saying holy holy
[1:07:17] holy Lord God Almighty which was which
[1:07:20] is and which is to come and when those
[1:07:23] beasts gave glory and honor and thanks
[1:07:25] to him that sat on the throne who liveth
[1:07:28] forever and ever and the four and 20
[1:07:30] Elders fall down before him that sat on
[1:07:33] the throne and worship him that liveth
[1:07:35] forever and ever and cast their crowns
[1:07:37] Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy
[1:07:40] oh Lord to receive glory and power and
[1:07:42] honor and power for thou has created all
[1:07:46] things and for thy pleasure they are and
[1:07:49] were created amen praise the Lord may
[1:07:52] God add His blessings to the reading of
[1:07:54] the word you may be seated I'm going to
[1:07:56] have to figure out a way different way
[1:07:58] to say that amen amen it's almost become
[1:08:00] a
[1:08:02] tradition amen amen praise the Lord amen
[1:08:07] all right so tonight this morning do you

[1:08:26] to do just go back here
[1:08:28] without back here for just a second
[1:08:30] again if you'll
[1:08:32] notice uh the first Beast was like a
[1:08:35] lion the second was like a calf the
[1:08:39] third like a the uh third Beast was like
[1:08:42] a face of a man and the fourth was like
[1:08:46] a flying eagle ain't that right a flying

[1:08:59] to brother brandham what those four
[1:09:00] powers were is that right and that there
[1:09:04] were four
[1:09:06] anointings down through the last 2,000

[1:09:31] that you're your children everybody you
[1:09:35] parents can use your discretion on when
[1:09:38] you have them read this but I think
[1:09:41] everybody ought to read this
[1:09:44] book Fox's book of
[1:09:47] Martyrs is that right Fox's book of
[1:09:51] Martyrs amen it talks about uh down
[1:09:55] through the Dark Ages over in the church
[1:09:56] ages you know for you know you know
[1:09:59] sometimes sometimes we don't think very
[1:10:01] much we just think here we're living in
[1:10:02] the 1900s and so forth and when you
[1:10:05] really begin to focus that there was
[1:10:07] 1900 years there was a lot of years
[1:10:10] folks is that right that is a lot of
[1:10:13] years and for the longest time all the
[1:10:16] way from the time of Paul all the way
[1:10:19] over to uh the time of Martin Luther
[1:10:22] is't that right Catholicism how many
[1:10:24] knows Catholic ISM
[1:10:27] ruled it was a terrible the dark cult
[1:10:30] the Dark
[1:10:31] Ages the Medieval Age or whatever it was
[1:10:34] a terrible age because those folks in
[1:10:37] that age they lived under that calf
[1:10:39] anointing isn't that right or Ox brother
[1:10:42] say that calf anointing amen which was M
[1:10:45] meant that they were uh uh uh they they
[1:10:48] they labored they were under labor
[1:10:50] that's what an ox or calf does it labors
[1:10:52] and they had to give their lives
[1:10:56] right just to be able to call themselves
[1:10:59] a
[1:11:01] Christian ain't that right that's why in
[1:11:04] this book I think you know this one here
[1:11:06] is one and of course I've got another
[1:11:08] book back there on the Holocaust on the
[1:11:10] Holocaust the Jews and everything that
[1:11:12] happened there World War I and World War
[1:11:14] II and so forth but you know there's
[1:11:16] things that our kids in America you know
[1:11:18] they need to be
[1:11:20] taught and this just comes but didn't
[1:11:22] brother bandam say you know Abraham
[1:11:24] Lincoln he was formed he had had a good
[1:11:25] mother and the two things that he had
[1:11:27] was the Bible and the fox's book of
[1:11:29] Martyrs why because it showed that back
[1:11:32] then just to be called a Christian amen
[1:11:35] you was he was in danger you know if if
[1:11:38] some sometimes they would be uh riding
[1:11:40] along and a priest and they would say
[1:11:42] the wrong thing to a priest he'd find
[1:11:44] out that you was a Christian and you
[1:11:45] wouldn't go home you'd be
[1:11:47] arrested he would say hey policemen come
[1:11:50] in here and arrest this guy those
[1:11:52] priests had that type of authority oh
[1:11:55] over the police and then they would take
[1:11:57] them and do whatever they chose to do
[1:11:59] with them they lived in catacombs and
[1:12:01] caves and so forth and all because I'm
[1:12:04] going to be a Christian look how nice we
[1:12:07] have it and people can't be a Christian
[1:12:09] this night what if you had it
[1:12:14] rough hello what if people come into
[1:12:17] this church and says if you don't if you
[1:12:19] don't denounce it and all these folks
[1:12:21] had to do was denounce Christianity and
[1:12:23] take itead rip by steak and nice and and
[1:12:26] a good
[1:12:28] life but rather than having a good life
[1:12:30] they chose the hard way they want it to
[1:12:32] be a Christian cuz it meant more than
[1:12:35] life to them how many believe that's the
[1:12:38] way it ought to be with us this morning
[1:12:40] amen it ought to be more than life to us
[1:12:43] it's more dear than breathing it's more
[1:12:45] dear than
[1:12:47] walking why because it's preserving your
[1:12:49] life knowing that you're going to live
[1:12:51] throughout eternity you going to die
[1:12:53] anyway someday amen it out might you
[1:12:55] might as well die for the right reason
[1:12:57] you might as well live for the right
[1:12:59] reason and for the right
[1:13:02] thing but they lived under that calf
[1:13:05] age Paul is age there for a while was
[1:13:08] the lion age under Christ and then it
[1:13:10] was the calf age then it was the face of
[1:13:12] man Luther Wesley and amen and the man
[1:13:15] age but the last age your
[1:13:19] age my
[1:13:21] age woo Glory I don't know about about
[1:13:25] you but I'm glad to be living in this
[1:13:27] age I am glad that God chose me to live
[1:13:31] in this
[1:13:33] hour folks if you ain't happy about that
[1:13:36] I don't know what you can be happy about
[1:13:38] God chose you he could have had you down
[1:13:40] through the Dark Ages he could have had
[1:13:42] you martyred he could have had you
[1:13:44] burned at the sake he could have had you
[1:13:45] thrust through with a sword have your
[1:13:47] head CH up chopped off like you did Paul
[1:13:49] he could have had you that time but he
[1:13:51] has you here this morning how many
[1:13:53] believe that you are here here for a
[1:13:55] special
[1:14:00] purpose you are here for a reason I'm
[1:14:03] here for a reason and if you are called
[1:14:05] to be an eagle guess what you can't help
[1:14:08] it you're going to be a
[1:14:11] [Applause]
[1:14:14] eagle and you are called to
[1:14:22] fly fly where flying to this morning I
[1:14:27] want to take you with the help of the
[1:14:28] Lord we're going to take take you about
[1:14:29] a a mile deep into the
[1:14:32] ocean we're going to start about a mile
[1:14:34] deep into the ocean and then we're going
[1:14:36] to go into the outer space all right
[1:14:40] would that be okay all right and then
[1:14:42] we're going to tie this in with the help
[1:14:44] of the Lord even with Wednesday night's
[1:14:47] service but boy I tell you when I got to
[1:14:49] studying
[1:14:50] this I need a two weeks of studying on
[1:14:54] this
[1:14:55] amen because it's it was just it's just
[1:14:58] good and I realized how
[1:15:01] little bringing out am mean in my
[1:15:05] study okay so let's go a mile deep
[1:15:10] brother B says I seen that long ago I
[1:15:12] was standing in a lobby waiting for an
[1:15:14] airplane and I seen where they had sent
[1:15:17] down a mile deep in the
[1:15:19] sea they went down there and where those
[1:15:22] fish had no eyes
[1:15:25] how many know that down that far is
[1:15:27] probably complete
[1:15:28] darkness light can't even penetrate that
[1:15:31] far they don't need I they don't even
[1:15:33] have any
[1:15:35] eyes and they had a light there and they
[1:15:38] was showing the most hideous looking
[1:15:40] marine life and some of them had
[1:15:43] phosphorus on the front of them and I
[1:15:46] was thinking one come by and it looked
[1:15:49] like it had a stove pipe hat on I've
[1:15:52] never seen such a idiot looking thing in
[1:15:54] my life
[1:15:56] weird looking
[1:15:58] creatures way down in the bottom of the
[1:16:01] ocean and the thing had no eyes but yet
[1:16:05] it has another sense that its direction
[1:16:08] it can find its food some kind of little
[1:16:10] sensors and Radars brother bam called it
[1:16:14] and I was thinking when I was looking at
[1:16:16] that what if I could use my eyes and let
[1:16:19] that little fish surrender itself to me
[1:16:22] with my little sense of with my sense of
[1:16:25] sight how I could guide it and I could
[1:16:28] see its food over here and say don't you
[1:16:30] pay no attention to that old radar viers
[1:16:33] or whatever you're going by cuz you have
[1:16:36] to be close to it he said you have to be
[1:16:38] close to it in order for that to work
[1:16:40] now I can tell you where your food's at
[1:16:42] and it would just listen to me my sense
[1:16:45] of sight so much greater than his sense
[1:16:48] of how he directs himself how much
[1:16:50] better off he would be how he could feed
[1:16:55] he'd be an odd little fish but he'd be
[1:16:58] following a sense of sight that was far
[1:17:00] better than the sense of that sense that
[1:17:02] controlled him and that's the way it is
[1:17:05] by the Holy Ghost if we can just let the
[1:17:08] holy ghost that great sense of the Holy
[1:17:10] Ghost lead us it'll show us things to
[1:17:12] come it'll way far beyond our natural
[1:17:18] senses amen what would it be like and he
[1:17:20] goes on to talking about what if you
[1:17:22] take that little fish and let him come
[1:17:24] amen and come the come on to land
[1:17:26] perhaps and see the sunshine and see the
[1:17:28] beauty of it all what how much greater a
[1:17:31] thing it would be how many knows that
[1:17:33] when you're born again amen it is like
[1:17:36] you have been transformed amen that I
[1:17:40] once was blind but now I see I was lost
[1:17:43] but now I'm found I mean I had a sense
[1:17:46] my my feeling see taste feel hear and
[1:17:48] smell amen my all my natural emotions
[1:17:51] all of those things will lead you the
[1:17:53] wrong way but God if we'll let him come
[1:17:56] in and let him control us let his sense
[1:17:58] be in me let his sense be in you am mean
[1:18:01] you'll see things you've never seen
[1:18:03] before amen you'll enjoy food that you
[1:18:05] have never enjoyed before you'll enjoy
[1:18:08] the peace of God the love of God the
[1:18:10] faith of almighty God the joy of the
[1:18:12] Lord is my
[1:18:14] strength how many believes if you'll
[1:18:16] just surrender
[1:18:19] yourself amen praise the
[1:18:23] Lord or what is I think brother B said
[1:18:26] one place he said what if we because we
[1:18:28] was once the hog is that right we had a
[1:18:31] hog
[1:18:33] nature that's right we just wallered
[1:18:35] into every nasty thing you could ever
[1:18:38] imagine hello what if a
[1:18:41] hog what if a hog would one day oh my I
[1:18:45] don't know if you have ever seen it but
[1:18:47] if you ever had a big old hog Waller a
[1:18:50] big bunch of mess and the stuff they'll
[1:18:51] wer in and eat and carry on it's nasty
[1:18:55] that right just nasty but if they' ever
[1:18:58] become a
[1:18:59] human if they ever become a human said
[1:19:02] Bo I don't never want to go to that slop
[1:19:04] again I don't know any none of y'all do
[1:19:06] that right no we don't do that why
[1:19:08] because you're a human being you have no
[1:19:10] interest in that type of thing now how
[1:19:13] many knows even the human beings in so
[1:19:15] in in a spiritual sense they like to go
[1:19:18] in the slop of the world and the filth
[1:19:20] of the world unregenerated humans they
[1:19:23] like the slap of the the world but get
[1:19:25] you transformed amen into a Christian
[1:19:28] one time and you won't have a desire for
[1:19:30] that old slap why you get a lamb nature
[1:19:34] then brother bam used that God used that
[1:19:37] to the Propet of God he used types and
[1:19:39] so forth and shadows amen he was a
[1:19:41] typologist he talk about if she ever got
[1:19:44] that lamb nature that's why I preached
[1:19:47] on the Lamb of the
[1:19:48] dove how many Knows Why brother bam
[1:19:51] preached on the lamb and the dove he
[1:19:53] preached on the lamb and the dove
[1:19:54] because his church amen had got a little
[1:19:57] bit there had gotten away from God and
[1:19:59] there was a lot of fussing going
[1:20:01] on there was a lot of Gossip going on
[1:20:05] and what did he say during that time he
[1:20:07] says if you got to get rid of that wolf
[1:20:09] nature you got to get rid of that snarl
[1:20:11] that you got that
[1:20:13] grow oh I don't like that person you
[1:20:15] know because of what they
[1:20:18] did
[1:20:20] amen get that snar get that Meek and
[1:20:22] gentle nature again get that lamb nature
[1:20:26] again praise be to God that lamb
[1:20:32] nature
[1:20:34] hallelujah praise the
[1:20:39] Lord all
[1:20:40] right that's
[1:20:42] right so from the depth from the
[1:20:46] bottom from the
[1:20:48] darkness how many knows that God has
[1:20:51] translated us from Darkness into the
[1:20:55] kingdom of his light that's right we
[1:20:57] came from that Darkness from way
[1:21:01] down amen I like that song when he
[1:21:05] reached way down for me I was lost and
[1:21:10] undone without God or his
[1:21:13] son amen but he reached
[1:21:18] down oh
[1:21:20] my hello I got saved when I was 20 20
[1:21:24] years old I'm 63 and I I love this stuff
[1:21:28] as much as ever it don't ever get old
[1:21:30] I'm as happy as I ever was why because
[1:21:34] amen I've become one of
[1:21:37] his praise be to God
[1:21:41] hallelujah okay let's I want to have one
[1:21:44] quote before I go into this next one but
[1:21:47] I want to talk to you about amen how
[1:21:50] many believes that we've been we uh
[1:21:53] we've been given good food
[1:21:55] you and I this is where it's really deep
[1:21:59] but we've been given Eagle food where
[1:22:01] the carcass is there the Eagles we've be
[1:22:03] gathered together the kind of food you
[1:22:06] eat the churches don't eat they can't
[1:22:09] handle this
[1:22:12] food it can say it right in the Bible
[1:22:15] and they still won't want to believe
[1:22:17] it even better bam says I'm amongst
[1:22:19] Pentecostals you say predestination is a
[1:22:21] bad
[1:22:22] word you know why it was a bad word
[1:22:25] because it just didn't make sense with
[1:22:27] their brains and the way that they
[1:22:28] wanted to think
[1:22:30] it hello how many knows God don't come
[1:22:33] and adjust his word to your brain in the
[1:22:35] way you think it ought to be no uhuh
[1:22:38] you've got to adjust your brain to what
[1:22:40] the word
[1:22:43] says W Glory it don't matter if you
[1:22:46] understand it or not you hav been called
[1:22:48] to have to understand it you have been
[1:22:51] called to believe
[1:22:53] it amen am and if God help helps you to
[1:22:56] understand it praise be to God that's
[1:23:00] wonderful
[1:23:02] amen praise the
[1:23:04] Lord so we've been given good
[1:23:08] food and I want to say this brother bam
[1:23:12] says he says if you give your canary
[1:23:15] bird all the Orthodox food that you
[1:23:19] could give him and then keep him in a
[1:23:21] cage what Good's it going to do him if
[1:23:25] you give him good food make him strong
[1:23:28] Wings if you don't give him room to
[1:23:32] fly so that's what I think that
[1:23:34] Christian has been caged up we ought to
[1:23:37] be
[1:23:39] free amen we ought to study the word
[1:23:42] believe the word give me
[1:23:44] room let's get out get moving exercise
[1:23:47] our
[1:23:48] faith then brother B say he went to the
[1:23:51] Cincinnati Zoo and he found they they
[1:23:53] had caught a
[1:23:54] my gracious caught an
[1:23:57] eagle now that's a terrible thing to
[1:24:00] do if you going to have a eagle in a
[1:24:03] cage at least get the egg hatch it and
[1:24:07] have it in the cage from birth it'll
[1:24:09] never know any different it' be a lot
[1:24:11] better but this
[1:24:14] Eagle was crap it knew what it was like
[1:24:18] to SAR the
[1:24:20] heavenlies Ain that right it knew what
[1:24:22] it was like to be free so when it got
[1:24:24] cage he said that thing would go and it
[1:24:26] would fly against the bars and flop back
[1:24:29] bars fly against there and flop back and
[1:24:32] fall on its back and everything else
[1:24:33] bloody and Feathers loose or whatever
[1:24:36] just tar up because why it wasn't meant
[1:24:39] to be caged how many knows you weren't
[1:24:42] meant to be caged I wasn't meant to be
[1:24:45] caged I was meant to SAR the
[1:24:49] heaven I was meant to be free
[1:24:54] you was meant to be free free
[1:25:01] indeed amen so give him all the right
[1:25:04] vitamins one other place in other words
[1:25:06] she says you know you know God look at
[1:25:08] what God did with David man God was with
[1:25:11] David and he slew Goliath look at what
[1:25:14] the three Hebrew children what God did
[1:25:16] there look at the Old Testament but say
[1:25:18] they're always pointing to a historical
[1:25:20] God they're feeding him food but they're
[1:25:23] saying that he doesn't do that
[1:25:27] anymore and that's caging him
[1:25:35] up it's caging them
[1:25:37] up if you and I could just realize if we
[1:25:40] could just get that in your heart to
[1:25:42] know for sure we hear it all the time
[1:25:45] but God is alive God is real
[1:25:49] folks the one that made it all he is
[1:25:51] real he's here now and he's here to
[1:25:54] liberate you he's here to set you
[1:26:00] free he's here to help you
[1:26:04] fly above the things of the world Fly
[1:26:07] Above sin Fly Above Temptation Fly Above
[1:26:10] every trap of the Devil he's here to
[1:26:13] help you do
[1:26:14] that God is not dead God is alive
[1:26:25] that's right aren't we glad thank you
[1:26:27] Lord Jesus I'm glad God that you are
[1:26:30] alive and we clap to you because we love
[1:26:34] you and appreciate you God cuz you're a
[1:26:37] living God you're the I
[1:26:40] am
[1:26:44] amen we want to get down to a little bit
[1:26:46] of detail on what this flying
[1:26:50] means what it
[1:26:52] means amen
[1:26:58] praise the
[1:27:09] Lord and we
[1:27:12] look at of
[1:27:15] course the eagle a't that right we look
[1:27:19] at the eagle
[1:27:25] and the food that the eagle eats of
[1:27:28] course but we know that the eagle is a
[1:27:32] special bird isn't
[1:27:35] he so much
[1:27:37] so that God chose to re to use it as the
[1:27:44] illustration of the Believers in this
[1:27:47] age prophets are likened unto Eagles
[1:27:50] aren't
[1:27:51] they and Children of the prophets can I
[1:27:54] say are lik an unto Eagles we are
[1:27:59] eaglets how many's a
[1:28:02] eaglet
[1:28:04] amen and if you know who you are it
[1:28:07] makes a big
[1:28:09] difference makes a big difference if you
[1:28:11] know who you are if you're not sure
[1:28:13] about who you are I hope before you this
[1:28:16] service is over you'll realize who you
[1:28:19] are recognize who you are you're not
[1:28:22] some Pawn of the devil you're not some
[1:28:24] I'm slave of the devil no you're not
[1:28:26] you're a Son of
[1:28:29] God and if so God is going to complete
[1:28:33] his word in
[1:28:39] you the eagle flies higher than any
[1:28:42] other
[1:28:44] bird goes beyond any other
[1:28:47] bird it leaves the ground
[1:28:51] amen you know
[1:28:54] first let me say
[1:28:55] this let's look at the
[1:28:58] scriptures that enable us to
[1:29:02] fly because it's one thing I like to do
[1:29:05] one thing I like to do even as an older
[1:29:07] guy
[1:29:10] that's
[1:29:12] imagine I like
[1:29:14] imagine I like to stretch my mind I like
[1:29:17] preachers that stretched my mind a
[1:29:18] little you
[1:29:21] know yeah imagine
[1:29:26] okay now I've got a scripture for
[1:29:30] it because God can do things that's
[1:29:34] beyond our
[1:29:36] imagination how many believe that much
[1:29:39] much greater than what you can even
[1:29:42] imagine
[1:29:44] that'sa Paul he said it this way in
[1:29:46] Ephesians 3 and 20 says now unto him to
[1:29:50] him that is able to do exceedingly
[1:29:54] above all that we could ask or
[1:30:02] thank oh my you know what you know if it
[1:30:06] wasn't for the fact that Joshua told the
[1:30:08] Sun and the Moon to stand still you and
[1:30:11] I probably would never believe that it
[1:30:13] could be done or would be
[1:30:16] done Ain that right but since it
[1:30:19] happened we can say you know God is able
[1:30:21] to stop the sun stop the Moon it's
[1:30:24] beyond what you could even
[1:30:26] imagine how does that work I thought we
[1:30:28] were all supposed to fly off or you know
[1:30:31] cause a major
[1:30:33] disruption God's got everything going in
[1:30:36] a perfect time everything perfect cycle
[1:30:38] and he can stop it you mean he can stop
[1:30:42] it and not have a major problem yeah he
[1:30:46] can God can do
[1:30:52] anything woo and if he can do that for
[1:30:55] Joshua what about you and I
[1:30:59] here hello God can do anything this
[1:31:03] [Applause]
[1:31:05] morning beyond what you can ask or
[1:31:13] think I love what Paul said he didn't
[1:31:16] say just a little bit more than you
[1:31:17] think he said exceedingly abundantly

[1:31:49] came the disciples to Jesus apart and
[1:31:51] said why could we not cast him out
[1:31:54] and Jesus said unto them because of your
[1:31:56] unbelief for verily I say unto you that

[1:51:25] how God's going to be almost came out of
[1:51:27] his mouth but he held
[1:51:30] it and he said the lord gave the Lord
[1:51:34] taken
[1:51:36] away the wife the love of his youth

[1:51:58] flies flying around ain't that right
[1:52:00] pain so much until eyes was
[1:52:03] crossed so much Agony she was

[1:52:21] heart's desire because he didn't go he
[1:52:24] was
[1:52:24] disobedient ain't that right and he paid
[1:52:28] a dear
[1:52:29] price very very hard
[1:52:34] thing
[1:52:37] amen but that's where he
[1:52:39] learned amen that's where he learned
[1:52:42] that's where he got his strength the
[1:52:43] others ask him later on the doctor says
[1:52:45] did you keep your
[1:52:48] religion

[1:52:54] amen how many believes that's how it
[1:52:56] is got put you on trial put you on test
[1:53:00] but if you're really God's child you're
[1:53:05] ego you're made for it you're
[1:53:08] pressurized for it you're made to handle
[1:53:12] that
[1:53:14] pressure even when you don't think you
[1:53:18] can I can I dare say that if you have
[1:53:22] come to the place to where you think you
[1:53:24] can't then you still haven't gotten into
[1:53:26] a as hard a condition as a lot of people

[1:54:17] his faith in almighty
[1:54:21] God God just used him ain't that
[1:54:25] right to overcome same way with

[1:54:32] Philistines if Samson could kill that
[1:54:34] many if shamgar could kill
[1:54:37] 600 I think we can kill a bunch
[1:54:39] ourselves no matter how many demons how
[1:54:42] many depressions no matter what comes
[1:54:44] with you just learn to rely on
[1:54:47] God but you've got to be surrendered to

[1:54:52] surrender yourself to
[1:54:54] God Amen he'll take care of the rest
[1:54:59] he'll do

[1:59:29] way better than the prophet of God CU he

[1:59:33] he would have reached for that
[1:59:36] gun bye-bye the eagle have been
[1:59:39] gone he wouldn't have sat a chance why

[2:09:11] message how many beli that it's there
[2:09:15] but you got to climb up to it I got to
[2:09:17] climb up to it now you didn't realize I

[2:09:30] wedding garment that we're to wear when

[2:10:25] fullness of the word to us don't you
[2:10:28] wouldn't it be something well no it
[2:10:30] wasn't quite enough we need another one
[2:10:33] no no no no no no that means this wasn't
[2:10:36] complete but I believe it's
[2:10:39] complete that's right to restore us
[2:10:42] restore the understanding of what Christ
[2:10:44] is really coming back for the
[2:10:46] understanding of Revelations 3:18 amen
[2:10:49] what the real goal of God is what the
[2:10:51] clothing of God is what the eyes have is
[2:10:54] to be able to

[2:11:21] Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ
[2:11:24] and our sins are gone as though we never
[2:11:26] did it in the first place that's higher
[2:11:29] than any other preacher I ever heard

[2:18:57] age you're not going to make it in the
[2:18:59] Rapture you'll come up maybe in the
[2:19:01] second Resurrection Christians may make
[2:19:03] it under other circumstances but to be
[2:19:06] in the Rapture to be the Bride of Jesus
[2:19:08] Christ you've got to be in the message
[2:19:10] of the hour because brother bandam said
[2:19:13] it this way he says we know that the
[2:19:17] church the Pentecostal Church could by
[2:19:20] no means means by no means carry out the
[2:19:22] last day message in its present
[2:19:26] condition
[2:19:29] hello why they're not
[2:19:32] flying they're fussing about whether
[2:19:34] he's coming on a white horse or on the
[2:19:37] cloud the Oneness the Tess the threeness
[2:19:42] the United Pentecostal this that or the
[2:19:44] other I that was the latest
[2:19:46] move y'all
[2:19:48] quiet why we can't even agree on one or
[2:19:51] two words in the Bible wouldn't it be
[2:19:54] bad if I had to come up here and preach
[2:19:55] and none of you said amen half the
[2:19:59] time and I'll tell you what' be even
[2:20:01] worse if I'd say stuff that you couldn't
[2:20:03] say Amen to well that sure ain't what
[2:20:06] the prophet said that sh ain't what the
[2:20:08] Bible said wouldn't you hate to have to
[2:20:10] sit there probably wouldn't sit there
[2:20:12] very long I wouldn't sit there very long
[2:20:15] I wouldn't listen to
[2:20:19] myself oh that's right why because
[2:20:22] anytime the devil tries to talk to me
[2:20:24] here I said don't you listen to that
[2:20:26] ain't that right oh praise be God we got
[2:20:29] to agree how many we got to be unified
[2:20:32] aren't you glad that we can have
[2:20:34] Unity thank you Jesus for the unity at
[2:20:37] evening light Tabernacle that agrees
[2:20:40] that we will say what the prophet said
[2:20:43] we will eat this Eagle food and it will
[2:20:46] translate us it'll take us out of here
[2:20:49] we're going to take a part of change one
[2:20:51] of these
[2:20:54] days but first he has to work on us and
