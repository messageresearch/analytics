amen have a great holiday it says so thank you all very much we really appreciate it amen and we are thankful that uh we get to have one more amen and one more christmas we know one of these days and one of these years we won't have this amen we'll be on the other side so we're looking forward to that time thank you honey amen i didn't ever restrain that we all kind of messed up again but thank y'all very much it means a lot amen praise the lord we love you with our very life amen amen so god bless you amen you can be seated for a minute amen this morning we want to make an announcement amen and something that i've been kind of looking forward to for a while and praying about amen and i know brother brad's been praying about it and brother brad and sister joyce how many appreciates them and their family i know they've uh the last decade or so uh all of us we've all went through many different trials i mean and i know they have and they have went through times they perhaps didn't know which way to go and what to do and i have certainly been there but thank you micah but this morning and uh we've been praying about it and i have talked to brother brad and and we feel that at this time amen i know brother brad's been out of the ministry for quite a few years and you know he used to minister for the lord and so he hasn't been doing it for a while and we know that even brother branham went off the field for a while because of things so that's not something that don't happen but we feel like he's still got a gift in his life that he could be a blessing to the bride of jesus christ amen and us here amen so uh i've talked to him and we both feel like it would be pleasing to the holy spirit and that the lord would bless him in him getting back into the ministry amen so i hope everybody would support that amen and certainly if we feel like it'll be pleasing to the lord and so and you know the one the one thing i see about this is that you know we me and brother brad we've had our differences hello we've had our separations but you know the one thing our prophet taught us and that is that it doesn't matter who you are if both of those people will get back under the blood of jesus christ it will bring them back together it will absolutely bring them back together and all differences are all gone all of that is and and when i was speaking to him i asked forgiveness for anything i have he said no there is nothing there in the same way with him it's all covered by the blood as brothers if you get things under the blood of jesus christ you can be genuine brothers again but if you don't get it under the blood you know it's not that way amen but anything that gets under the blood it gets taken care of and i believe that and i think this is a a real milestone it's a great thing amen and so we just really appreciate them and we pray that the lord will just bless them their family their two boys god has already blessed them amen he's been good to him amen he's got a beautiful place he's given them over here real close to the church and so forth um and so we appreciate amen the blessing that they have been here and are and so we look forward to some more time in january perhaps you know get started and looking forward to you know having him minister again perhaps as an evangelist amen uh and also help here at the church so that's really wonderful amen so if you will i'll stand with me when i have him come up we're gonna have the elders of the church and just pray over him and bless him and ask god to just bless him in that in his ministry amen i guess brother williams going for david amen god bless you brother love you brother amen let's lay our hands upon him and just pray god's blessing upon him each one just bow your heads and pray for brother brad and his family for his ministry and that god will have his way our heavenly father lord jesus as we have prayed about this we've committed to you in such your perfect will father we just feel god at this time it'd be a good time lord for brother brother brad to get back in the harness lord to be a blessing to your people father not only here but wherever he would go god that he would bring souls to you that he would be edifying to the body of christ part of the fivefold ministry lord we ask god any any fault any failures on any of our parts put it all under the blood lord and help us to serve you in a greater measure than what we have lord bless my brother in the name of jesus christ may his ministry prosper lord and be blessed we ask god for his family that you would bless them lord jesus for we know lord when you're on the front line satan won't like that lord and father i just pray a special blessing upon him lord in his ministry now lord anoint him lord to minister your word to stay with the prophet to say with you a word to say only what the prophet said say only what the bible says and to stay with you father and to your people lord may he be a blessing now we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen thank you lord jesus thank you ame man god is good isn't he i would like to have all the heads of each family after service after it's dismissed you mean to stay i want to have a talk with each basically a men's meeting after service we just have some information we want to share with you amen so if you would just stay and it's just some information it's nothing major but we just want to share some information with you and so god bless you and the rest of you most of you will probably find out what it's all about and so just put that in your pocket and don't worry about it during service amen amen and we'll just want to have the holy spirit to have his way i mean last friday saturday not this one but before i mean i came down with something i went to um what was the place called home depot thank you home depot to get some sealer and so forth and you know i went in there got my material and everything and on the way out there's a girl that stopped me beginning to talk to me and i had two big old five gallon buckets of sealer and and she tried to sell me something and i said i'm not interested ma'am i got to go and i started what kept walking and she kept talking i said well you know if she keep talking i said i'll be a gentleman and i turn around set my about buckets down and talk to her but she was up pretty close and so anyway at the end of it all i says well i'm just not really interested at all you know how it is but i always thought it was kind of peculiar that they'd have somebody get up in your face like that during this time you know and but anyway uh i feel like maybe i picked it up there i don't know what it was but i know it was some uh it was you know it was something that others i've had have had and they've been diagnosed with the cove but in it but you know i don't know whether it was or not i don't really think it was but there's so many symptoms they claim that come with it you never know for sure so we were really really sick threw up about seven eight times and i think when i got the last of the acid finally thrilled up you know my stomach after a period of time turned and and you know of course i would take pep the bismol and any kind of drink you would drink he just all came right back up but it just i could feel when it turned and so uh you know i was glad we never did but it was like a 24-hour virus that we had and and i was very glad that it wasn't anything worse because i know i've talked to troy and robin and i know william and different ones natalie all even michelle different ones have had a five or six day fever and you know that's rough when you've got anything for five or six days or even eight days and uh better stephen michelle you know really feel for them and system sister michelle especially because she's had it first seems like a long time but um so you know but i'm just thankful the lord's delivering us amen and that we're getting to feeling better and so we just pray for those that have had it we thank god for healing those who've had it amen and over it and so i know i hadn't been that sick in that way probably in about a decade it was been a long time since i you know felt that sick but i was just very glad it didn't last longer than it did with the help of the lord so amen um other than that i can't think of any anything um any other announcements or anything so let's just bow our heads enter into the service this morning kind heavenly father we come before you lord once again lord thankful and during this christmas season during this winter time lord jesus to be able to assemble ourselves together in your name knowing god that wherever two or three are gathered in there you will be in our midst lord jesus and that's truly what we're so grateful for father is that you're with us even in us to the end of the age father we just do pray for each one once again lord both those that are recovering perhaps those who are not feeling well we ask for the grace of god to go to them lord and just to raise them up lord we believe lord that by your stripes they are healed we each one father we thank you lord jesus for the healing properties lord of uh the healing power of almighty god that comes to us and heals us lord we ask god that you'll take lord what i feel lord you've laid upon my heart to speak this morning help us lord just by the power of your spirit to say what you once said lord but most of all father we want you to come in a special way and speak to us along the way that we could go from here saying did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way we love you lord jesus with all of our heart we're so grateful to be able to assemble ourselves together having the freedom to do so knowing that it's been prophesied that some day these things places will be shut down lord so we do appreciate we cherish these times together when we can open your word lord the infallible unfailing eternal word of god we ask god that we go from here better people than what we've come closer to you lord jesus more surrender to you lord we ask god that you'll just speak now father in the name of jesus christ amen and amen turn your bibles if you will to psalms 127. if i was to call it a christmas message this would be my christmas message amen in psalms 127 and we want to take the first verse except the lord built the house they labor in vain that built it except the lord keep the city the watchman wakeeth but in vain may god have its blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated this morning i want to speak for a little while on the acts the acts of god a-c-t-s the acts of god amen and what brought me to this was meditation and thinking about the lord and thinking about what god really does for us amen and you know and how that without him and unless it is him doing it it's really not worth a whole lot amen for example just meeting here coming together taking our time getting ourselves ready coming to church but you know if it wasn't for the lord coming and meeting us with us this morning it would be in vain it wouldn't really mean a lot would it now i say that because we do realize that there is enormous amounts of people that are doing that this morning that are meeting in vain amen because our prophet taught us and preached a message called doing god a service without it being his will is that right so many people are worshiping the lord they're serving the lord they're doing whatever they think is right whatever they think that the lord once done isn't that right but yet in that it's still of no use you know because if you'll remember the bible says you know in that day they'll come say heaven we prophesied and have we done many mighty works in your name and he'll confess what depart from me i never knew you so they did do a lot people do a lot for the lord amen but they do it perhaps the way they want to do it or the way they think it should be done how many knows that's not acceptable to god god didn't have to ask you how it should be done no or where or how god doesn't do what he wants it done amen and it'll be it's going to be a sad day now let's talk about this for just a few minutes let's talk about this part where he says that you know how it says that except the lord keep the city let me just read the first part of it except the lord built the house they labor in vain so people can do things but that labor is in vain if god is not in it if it isn't the will of god remember it's all in vain no matter what you do if it is in the will of god then it's in vain how many knows you can do a service of god a god of service without it being his will and then you're really not serving god you may appease your mind you may think that you are but you're really not amen i like a little plaque that my wife bought brought it in the house and now you know she's always getting these easy as a whatnot woman you know she's a lot of whatnot but i like what she got now on this little plaque it said pray about everything i mean please that's what you got you gotta pray about everything praise the lord and then my mind went over to paul in first corinthians the ninth chapter because how many know that paul didn't want to run this race in vain there's really not any any good in doing anything that is vain that is in lame amen for naught paul wanted to make sure he didn't run in vain and so he talked about the race that he was running he says no ye not that they which run in a race run off but run receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain praise the lord how many of us that's if you do anything if you have any purpose in anything you want to achieve that purpose not get there halfway not get there almost and then still not get there now i know there's two million two million of the israelites that hates they started in the race they started to run amen and i believe in first corinthians paul in the next chapter talked about how did they drank from the same spiritual rock they were all under the pillar of fire they all came out of egypt they all went that far but they never obtained you know as we get older we just don't like to do things and fail in it isn't that right we don't like to fail when you set out to do something you like to get your achievement that's the way paul was if i'm going to start this then i want to i want to finish this race i want to go all the way amen so now we're getting on down here every man that striveth for the mastery is tempered in all things now they do it for to obtain a corruptable crown but we are incorruptable there i therefore so run not as i uncertainty so fight i and this is where i want to get to not as one that beateth the air amen it you know when you don't accomplish your mission it's pretty much as good as nothing i mean you think about i think about beating the air what have i done are we getting anything done at all hello no yeah it's it's viewed out sure the wind's moving if it was smokey here and you swished your hand through it sure it would make an effect you could see it isn't that right but it's pretty much paul was saying not one that just is speeding the air he in his heart he wanted amen some substance he wanted a man to obtain something he wanted to mean something praise the lord praise be to god so we think about it unless god does it remember unless god's in it you're beating the air you're fighting you're running you're doing is absolutely futile unless it's god doing it amen this applies to the preacher more than anybody huh should we say not more than anybody i shouldn't say that because it applies to us all isn't that right but if i come up here and it isn't the lord's doing you're listening in vain it means nothing a gathering together you know and this is really a message where we're just here to glo glorify god we're the brag once again on god because he's the only one that's worth bragging about huh you're going to brag about muhammad ali but how did he spend his years i'm not sure if it was dementia or what it was horrible ending like amen and with what worshiping muslim or something a different religion left christianity what's his end like nothing to be proud of all comes to nod but we're serving one that never gets old never gets tired never sleeps he was here from the beginning he was here before the beginning he'll be here after the end we're like a drop in the bucket our lives are just like a little dot in time like a little shadow a little vapor that goes by your life doesn't mean much unless god is in it amen unless god is in it it is in vain unless god does it let's talk about god doing some things first of all how many knows that unless god saves you you're not going to get saved you might try to have faith isn't that right well i want to try to believe i'm going to try to believe brother bam says you know that if god don't honor if he don't recognize your faith you'll never receive the baptism of the holy ghost huh and in the otherwise he says if god does recognize your faith he will instantly baptize you with the baptism of the holy ghost how many believes that you receiving the holy ghost is your vindication that god accepted your faith but if god don't accept your faith and if he don't give you the holy ghost you are just as much as sinner as what you ever was huh you're just as lost as what you ever was people put on act like make like pretend but their true colors show sooner or later amen i was listening brother brown yesterday he was talking about what the evidence of the holy ghost is and i thought you know there is a bible evidence of the holy ghost and jesus said what it was jesus said what the evidence was amen of whether you're a good tree or whether you're a bad tree am i right what did he say by their fruits ye shall know them amen praise the lord amen and so you look at that you look at the fruit that you're bearing you look at what god does god has to do it now we know that the new birth the prophet taught us that the new birth is a revelation it's something that's revealed to you amen because it says uh you know even even to peter flesh and blood was it was not revealed to peter by flesh and blood but my father revealed it to him and he says you know unless a person has a back side of the desert experience this don't vote for just the preachers behind the brother bam says ain't no preacher got no right back here unless he has what met god without that it's all in vain am i right it's no good you have to meet god in other words god has to come down and meet you hey hey we all know that moses on the backside of the desert he could have went and looked at all kinds of bushes and everything else but that didn't ever done him any good it had to be god there in that version that made the difference amen oh my this is all about really this morning it's about being completely surrendered to god it's about really making room for god all right i was thinking about that how that jesus there was no room for him in the end huh there was no room for jesus in the end now how many knows have dated if the everybody in the end would have known isn't that right and first half some of them didn't know i don't know maybe joseph and mary come strolling up there with their donkey up there to the front door as we would imagine you know come up around the front door of the hotel to check in and perhaps a lot of people were saying oh they're looking there there's joseph and mary you know they're having a baby and they they got married you know so before they were getting before they got married you know she was oh my hey he looked down on her and so forth and and you know and and there they were perhaps at the front register amen and joseph asked hey i really need a room real bad you know and uh cashier says you know i'm sorry but we're full and other people heard you know that they were telling him that they was all full we ain't got no room for now if they didn't truly understand what that little baby was all about huh then they said look we'll take the barn we'll go out there and sleep in the barn with the animals you take my room but nobody was willing to give him a room huh so that's what this morning's about it's about making room for him amen i want to look at some things praise the lord jesus said made the statement he says you know abide in me and my words abide in you and you can ask what you will for without me you can do it's really all in vain if he ain't doing it if it ain't the holy ghost in you doing it you're doing it in vain amen i wrote down here in my notes if you're drawing a breath and it ain't by god you're wasting your breath if you're living your life and it isn't god living it you're living in lane praise the lord oh holy flower bruh stephen laster he called me yesterday and he run at prayer you know because they've had it rough you know from a blowed head gasket to sickness in the house and it's just ranging forwards but in the middle of all that brother stephen got to encourage me and he says you know brother he says you know you know he's not called to be a preacher but he likes to be an encouragement to preachers huh how many believes you you may not be part of the five-fold ministry but you can still edify the body of christ every one of us has something that we can let god do through us every one of us he was saying he made a statement and testifying to me he said motherboard you know i didn't know where he was going with this for sure he said you know god he predestinated us before the foundation of the world and you know he says you know he really wouldn't have done that if he'd known you wasn't going to make it huh how many believes now i thought that was such a word of wisdom you know in the middle of uh hard times here he is yielded to god enough to be actually be able to say something like that that would be encouraging that would be inspiring and it would be so true i thought that's the truth that ought to make us all get up out of our seats and shout and say god i believe that you did pronounce it i believe that you chose me and i know i'm gonna make it amen if you believe you're one of god's children you wrote before the foundation of the world and god has let you this far he isn't going to take you just so far and let you down if you fall down god will get you back up you may even try to run but god will catch you he knows you're gonna make it hey you think that's not wait till we get over there brother john wade we're gonna scream and holler i knew it i knew i was going to make it because i knew god took me through every trial took me through every test took me through the apps took me through the downs took me to the end took me out but he kept me and it was not me it was him that's why we're not going to have a problem with praising god worshiping god amen praise be to god let's look at the times you know some people in the world think that god is just quiet shh where's god at they don't know where god is and jesus said a little while the world won't see me no more i wonder where we're live aren't they all wondering where in the world he is yeah they put him out of their school put him out of donation put him out there all the saturday congress used to have an extra chair for him they took that away huh anyway but you know but he says they won't see me no more but you will see me how many do we have this morning that see him i see him in every trial i see him through every roadblock i see him through every wall that is in front of me i see him and he takes me through glory [Music] hello y'all kind of quiet i'm wondering has god ever take you through a wall you couldn't get over it you couldn't get under it you couldn't get around it let me tell you something this very building is a absolute miracle this building wasn't supposed to be finished this building was never supposed to make it no never was supposed to make it and if it wasn't for god it would have never made it if god don't build the house you're doing it in vain it has to be god and if god before us who can be against you i want to say this this morning that every carnal every attempt everything that you try to accomplish through your flesh is all in vain amen completely fail not just once but every single time never will be blessed that's why it's so important that we make sure that it's god in your life god in my life working every day every moment every breath that we draw every service that we have make sure that it's god doing it amen so we think about it your very salvation your very new birth you don't get the holy ghost unless god gives it to you acts we call it the book of acts we have another book that they call the acts of the prophet is that right but how many know you can look and you can look and read every part and every page of the acts of the prophet huh and you really realize that it wasn't really the prophet it was god it was the acts of god through the prophet so people that want us think that god is a quiet god i have news for him he was very noisy in this time he was very loud in our generation he faced all the hindus the buddhist sikhs all of the religions of the world faced him right down and said let your god open this blind man's eyes and i'll become a buddha muhammad or whatever you are let him come and open this blind man's eyes that's what god said through the prophet he never said it unless god showed him in there right so what was it really it was god to the prophet that's what he did and people still think he's silent boy are you in for a rude awakening you couldn't be more wrong god is not a quiet god how many believe that god is not quiet in your life he's not quiet in my life before the service is over i want to talk to you about how to do you have to amen that guy comes down and he helps you to open up your heart he opens up the channel so that you can actually let him come in and work through you because he said the works that i do shall you do also remember there's everything that jesus did he says the works that i do shall you do also if we're not doing those works that he's that we would do that we are not surrendered to god the way we're supposed to be amen moses in his carnal self say yeah i'm a deliverer my mama said i was a deliverer mama said i was a beautiful child i have a very special place and god has called me to deliver god he's going to use me to deliver them and he began to see their own people all beat up and everything else and an egyptian smiting as a jew right and he went over there and killed that egyptian buried him in the sand to try to cover his tracks huh pharaoh finds out about this and he had to run for his life hello the best that he could do with his own carnal mind and his own ability was a dead egyptian and complete failure [Music] that's what any of one of us do if we try to do anything in ourself amen that's our biggest problem is ourself but after he met god on the back side of the desert 40 years later and then he had to get on a desert for 40 years and god had to get all of the old moses out of him huh you didn't do nothing look at you you're nothing but a sheepherder on the backside of the desert nobody knows you even exist you're not so popular anymore huh until one day god called i mean that makes all the difference in the world when god does something that's what we need more in our services we need god to do something we need him to come we need him to do it then something will happen it's not what we can manufacture it's not what we can conjure up no that's not it at all it's about what god does it's the only thing that's of any value we're laboring in vain we're meeting in vain unless it's god that's doing it amen after moses met him in the burning bush after god said come up here i want to have a talk with you and he come up there on the backside and that way up in the mountains and he seen his burning bush he met the pillar of fire how many knows nobody could ever come in the presence of jesus and be the same person again it'll change you forever it's the difference between a carnal believer and a spiritual believer it's a difference between you absolutely being on a rock that can never move you it'll hold you it holds you you don't hold it because if you're holding it huh well i better quit this and i better quit that i heard brother brown said how dependent muscles how they used to be legalistic oh women don't you cut your hair don't you do this out in the other and so forth he says they were doing it out of legalism trying to be holier than thou well i don't do this and i don't do that and i don't if you got that attitude you got a holier-than-thou attitude and it's the wrong spirit now they're cutting their hair and doing everything else in the book but it's just that's got to come from down here it's got to come from down here because if it ain't coming from there it don't do you no good anyway it's just a self-righteousness let me tell you something that's where every man won a child especially our young folks it's good to see somebody that's getting their own experience it's good to see danny on their speak testifying you know i believe that this is not just some gimmick this is the prophet of god love god have a revelation a personal revelation stand up for it no matter what anybody says you know you've been there amen every christian that's truly born again a real christian has met god on the backside of today you have come face to face with that pillar of fire that holy spirit you have met it has come down and it has accepted you if it hasn't accepted you you're not a christian yet huh how many please when you get the baptism of the holy ghost when god really deals with you you are more than happy to get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you mourn glad to witness to everybody i'm giving my life to almighty god i want the holy ghost i'm dead and i want him to live i want him to live in me i don't want him to be he's no more in the manger isn't that right he's in a different manger where is he now he's in the manger of your heart that's where almighty god is how many believes god is still working he's still doing things sure he is amen so god has to reveal it one place he says you know it's not by might nor by power but it's by my spirit saith the lord paul says you know they that are led by the spirit they are the children of god amen how many believes that you have to be led by the spirit not by your flesh it's so easy to let the flesh lead you sometimes but the holy spirit is the one that's supposed to lead you to guide you into everything it's not by your power not by your might but it's by his spirit saith the lord amen praise the lord everything you do and all that you do should be in the will of god even business people this just came to my mind when i was thinking about even the business people business people you know a lot of times we'll say well the bible says uh in timothy believes somewhere he talks about you know if you're going to say well i'm going to go into a certain city and sojourn and do business it says the bible says you ought to say if the lord's will isn't that right don't even conduct your business unless you say lord if it'd be your will because that's the way that jesus was i believe that this is amen getting the bride ready we're going to have to be more like jesus if we're going to meet him in this high are you with me we're going to have to think more like jesus we're going to have to act more like jesus we're going to have to have more of his works if we expect to leave this place and i'll believe we're past due it's passed through his coming amen sure it's way late how can we possibly go to 20 21. hey i i i heard brother bram say the other day he says you know i predict and totally annihilation of the world by 1977. he he he covered it all not just the ushering and i'm living but it talked about the annihilation he says america will be burnt to a crisp it won't be no just some sticks sticking up hello he all predicted all of that but i have no i now that's prediction he said not prophecy but i said the woman think that's a prophecy huh and here we are 20 20 folks it's time for the bride to get ready oh let me just tell you something else brother stephen encouraged me i i appreciate him amen he talked about you know he says i believe the god has got to fight i hope you don't mind me telling me this i don't think he does the five-fold minister he says i believe that god has got the best for last i don't know about you but i sure don't feel that way but you know i had a good point i said not just the ministry i said but i believe every one of his children are the best i believe he saved the best for last amen you got to be the best not because i say or you say but if god picks you you got to be the best you are the best if god chose you and he's here and he has chosen you and me to finish this out how many wants to do a better job lord help me to do a better job finishing this thing out i want to go out and be just like the lord thank you lord jesus just help me amen to surrender more to him i don't want to beat the air if any anything we don't like beating the air we don't like spinning our tires we don't like failing we don't like doing things in vain and there'll be many of them on that day how many knows on that day there'll be many of them disappointed because they did all of those things and yet it was in vain because god was not in it i don't know if mike can look it up or not but there's a song that talks about god did we know that i think there's like a course or the course goes god who who opened up the red sea god did we know huh something about god did we know you mean i thought that's the truth no matter what happened whether it was the red sea whether it was deliverance it was god that did it amen let me just go to a scripture talks about the acts of god for a minute how many believes that it's the acts of god before i go back to the old testament touch that comes to my mind about the book of acts let's talk about the book of acts the book of acts brother bam said that there was a man came to him and he said you know the book of acts is just the scaffold work of the church huh now what if we had we did have set scaffold up here laying the brick we were scaffolding me brother john he's not here this morning but we was just laying there bringing them scout for work and and and you brought somebody up to look at the building how it's coming and that person said boy that scaffolding work right here that's a beautiful building rattle them a little huh i love these scaffolds that's a beautiful building here you'd say no not the scaffold the building but if you say no this is a building i said we need to ride back where we could pick you up at not too intelligent but they came to him with that it was just kind of a rough it was just a scaffold work of the church but the man says no no it was the church it was the building i mean the book of acts was the acts of the holy spirit in his church that's why we say that however they acted in the book of acts if you've got the holy ghost you're gonna act the same way anytime god raises a people up a church up it starts another book of acts so let me ask you this question this morning before you come to the altar are you fulfilling like they did in the book of acts huh are we there no we're not there amen don't you long to see a crippled man crippled and somebody lay their hands so rise up and walk i petered it huh perhaps somebody gets bit by a snake just shake it off you didn't bread brahms time isn't that right that's right god's still the same god he still does the same things but this christmas we should ask ourselves are we fulfilling another book of acts is it god acting through us or do we still have too much of ourself huh psalms 145 this is what we're doing this morning talking and magnifying the lord for his mighty acts because that's really the only thing brad was bragging about is what god does my life the only thing worth bragging about the only thing good in my life is what god did there's none good it's only him that's good 145 says i will extol thee my god o king i will blessed in thy name forever and ever every day will i bless thee and i will praise thy name forever and ever great is the lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable that's right i stand up here and i begin to talk about his greatness and it's just unsearchable one generation shall praise thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts hallelujah oh my praise be to god pharaoh said i ain't letting them go but after moses surrendered himself to god he said let my people go he wasn't a coward he wasn't scared he didn't hide on the backside of the desert he came right up the pharaoh's face looked him in the eye and he said let my people go no that wasn't moses that was god speaking through moses amen his mighty acts of how delivered them over there's other scriptures where where where uh david describes perfectly how he delivered them and how he fed them and how he brought them out and all the things that god did here's just a partial of it i will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works and men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts hallelujah amen the egyptians are saying to go after men going through the red sea also impersonating them drowned in the red sea every horse every man lost their breath died these terrible axe this terrible great power amen and they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness and shall sing of thy righteousness hallelujah how many glad that you're not depending on your righteousness you're depending what he did for you on the cross you're depending on his righteousness how wonderful it is the lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great mercy the lord is good to all and his tender mercies are all over his works all thy work shall praise thee o lord and thy saint shall bless thee amen how many believes that they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power amen to make known unto the sons of men his mighty acts and the glorious majesty of his kingdom oh my that's what we want to do this morning we want to talk about his mighty power his mighty acts of what he does they were in the upper room in the book of acts and they were waiting for the promise isn't that right they were there they were perhaps saying god i don't know what to do we've been here nine days now and you said to come and we don't know but lord here we are forgive us of any sin make us right lord we repent of anything wrong god make us ready help us lord come father come but unless god come and they have been sitting there just like forever how many knows what made the difference is when the mighty rushing wind came down folks i'm here to tell you that'll make a difference in the service in your life is when that rushing wind comes down when god comes down and does something it makes all the difference in the world every young person seeking the baptism of the holy ghost that is what you're looking for is for god to come down and change your desire amen to forgive you of your sins to give you a peace that passes understanding to give you joy on the inside or you'll never be able to say brother bile i know what you're talking about when you talk about a peace that passes understanding because i have experienced it otherwise i'm you're just hearing what i'm saying my experience doesn't do you any good you got to have your experience but i know what it's like to have joy unspeakable until you just want to scream to the world glory hallelujah i can't hold myself i'm like a little child i'm just so happy i don't know what to do with myself if you haven't experienced that and don't know that yourself the peace that comes with justification we have peace with god being justified in other words he has forgiven you of your sins and he has given you peace in your heart that's what god does amen but their next they waited for that baptism of the holy ghost if he didn't come they were all just going to be sitting there they would have never been changed nothing would have ever happened but what happened is god came down baptized them with the holy ghost and power for service king then you'll be witnesses of me amen amen before you might have just said yeah god is good you know we we just hope that he'll give us the baptism the holy ghost someday hope you know god is great but after they got the baptism of the holy ghost they come out there out of the upper room screaming and stammering lips another tongue speaking in tongues praising god they weren't ashamed anymore it was something there that happened i believe something has to happen something happened and he set the whole world on fire god set the world on fire through who through these people and it was no longer the book of acts but it was the acts of the holy spirit in his church sorry was the book of that book of the acts of god is what it was amen praise the lord how many is glad that we don't serve a silent god that isn't dealing in the affairs of men no he's a very present help in time of trouble god is very very real and i guarantee you this if you if they people put the wrong the right kind of pressure and they bring you into the same kind of situations amen that other people have been brought into god well come on how many believe god's going to come on the scene you let it go you go up against the ball you come to those places amen and god always comes down when the when the um another wonderful act that god had is when saul and all of the israelites were camped down and the philistines had them all blocked down amen they were at a stalemate amen in a giant glass kept boasting for about a month i guess kept coming out every day come on give me a man [Music] but god came down in a little man called david that made all the difference in the world was god came into david and inspired david how many knows we can do a lot of stuff but if it's in yourself it'll fail but if god will inspire you to do it oh my it'll be a complete success but it has to be the inspiration of god david said who is this uncircumcised philistine amen i can just hear the holy spirit speaking through david because somebody knows even samson he was he was powerless until and the spirit came upon him say uh sham god the spirit came upon him when god comes down it makes all the difference in the world that's why we want every day of our life that's what we want in our services for god to come down and we have to have open hearts for that let me talk to you about that for a little bit how many believes that's what it takes it takes an open heart it takes faith it takes a surrendered life surrender it takes a dying to ourselves to see god come and do the works that he did remember he said the works that i do show you also because i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you how many knows it's important that every one of us has a death to ourself you have to die to yourself for god to be able to do it anything all right i have i got one quote that i want to read this morning one quote oh my let me finish with god coming down would that be okay you know hurry right i know it was a long time wasn't it from last time it didn't save us a long time even though i was sick and on my bed amen streaming on my bed i said it's kind of nice but i feel backslidders all get out i would not want to do this huh i'm like i'm not with the saints i'm not cleaned up i'm not praising god i'm not you know i'm just sitting here not feeling good and all and that's where you should stay if you're sick like this with the pandemic we continue to ask people to stay away if you would amen it isn't that you don't have faith and i don't have faith but there may be others that don't have faith amen just a wise thing to do but i felt terrible it was just like oh man i would a whole lot be rather be in church yesterday in friday i was like man when sunday ever going to get here i'm ready to get back in the house of god how many knows it's we don't do this because you have to i don't have to do this i want to do this i love coming to church i love cleaning myself up and brushing my teeth hello amen and coming to church getting ready to worship the lord why because he's worth it oh my i was on the way to church and i thought think of the hope that we have think of this how did even though we have death to deal with yet perhaps in the body and so forth but yet we know what's over on the other side we know that god is eternal and if we're a part of god we're as eternal as he is we're going to be in the how happy we are to be and yet brother branham says you know if there was no hereafter if there was no heaven to go to i would want to do this right here all my life why because some people do it for reward other people didn't realize that this is the best thing on the planet this is the best way to live this is what gives you peace this is what gives you joy this is what gives you happiness why wouldn't you want that that's the main three main ingredients probably in our life is peace joy and happiness amen and you have that he said he wouldn't he wouldn't he wouldn't do this this here if there was no reward at all amen anyway praise the lord okay brother brad says i used to preach over in the baptist church a little sermon called and i called it let loose and let god maybe we could call it let go and let god now if brother branham was inspired by something i believe it's the right inspiration don't you so if he realized that people learn need to learn to let go and let god have his wonderful way now how many knows god just doesn't push himself on you he doesn't force you he's not that kind of a god you have to let him you have to open your heart all right that's right just let loose and let god as you get yourself into it and as as long as you get yourself into it then there's no way you know amen god can't do anything as long as you're in the way this is going to be my punchline this morning you know the biggest enemy i got is william branham oh that hairy little ugly squini-eyed demon that spooky looking devil that mean thing that causes doubt and all kinds of things about no he's not your biggest enemy huh the devil himself was rendered powerless at calvary huh you're worse than the hairy devil i don't know if some say he's hairy and i don't know my father-in-law he's touched one of them he says walking down the hall thought it was his daughter and he touched this hairy looking thing come to find out and it went into this room and he went over to his daughter and his daughter was laying over there ah chills all up and down you know what i'm saying but whether dear harry or not how many knows well let me just come somebody didn't brother bram talk about that bat looking with the long hair that's right so yeah big and hairy and uglier in the bat but yet you're worse than that i'm worse than that yourself brother brahm says is the biggest enemy that you have what is that that's that old self that's in there let me say what happens with this self all right biggest enemy of god's william brown he's always in god's way if i can just get him out of the way then god can go to work that's my message this morning let's get ourself out of the way everybody hear this on stream if you can get yourself out of the way god can complete his acts god can work just like he did in the book of acts how many is jesus still wants to save the lost he still wants to be the light in your community and in your neighborhood he wants to be a light to your workers or workers to the boss he wants to be the light everywhere you are he wants to heal the sick raise the dead he wants to do all of these things he wants to work miracles but if it's not happening then guess what you're in the way verbum says he's to god it gets in the way what is the gift brother branham a gift is to get yourself out of the way when i come up here so many times i'll rely on notes i'll rely on my my my my study this out of the other and if it gots in it it's okay but i can do that in myself and it really doesn't fly huh i have to learn to get myself out of the way so god can work how many believes is that's true for the preacher don't you think that's for every christian you have to learn to get yourself out of the way just sitting there right now this morning think about it i know we've been sitting here what i don't know how many minutes but we've been sitting here while right now it's about you about you getting yourself out of the way what might happen if you really get yourself out of the way so he says if i can just get him out then god can go to work that's your worst enemy is yourself that old man that was how many how why would god tell us to die to ourselves but if samson not just died but rot that guy's got to be gone when we bury somebody by the water there it is a representation that the old man is dead we're burying him now he's dead you don't think your own thoughts anymore you don't live your own life you don't have your own will you don't have any of that and just comes to mind one of the things that is in our life this everybody should listen to this one part of our life that perhaps stops god's in his tracks from working through us is you know what it is it's things that we know that we do that we shouldn't and yet we do them bible called it iniquity because remember this if you don't get rid of that if you don't get rid of that iniquity huh things that the holy spirit tells you you ought to do or tells you you should do and you still don't do it you're actually a worker of iniquity how many people on that day he's gonna say depart from me you that knew you should do better and you didn't you blocked me i couldn't work through you because you knew what you should do but yet you didn't workers of iniquity depart from me how many would say like david said lord take all iniquity out of my life help me from this sunday morning on anything i know that i shouldn't do god don't let me do it lord give me the strength not to do it otherwise i am a worker of iniquity and it stops god and he can't work through you how many knows that god doesn't work through iniquity he works through a pure heart that is 100 surrendered to him if it had to surrender himself samson surrendered his strength and look at what god did moses had to surrender himself his mind his soul his future his thoughts his ambition everything has to be surrendered to god young people if you're going to work for god and see what god worked through you it's all got to be surrendered lord i know what you want me to do i don't know where you want me to go i want you but here i am my mouth i don't want my mouth to open unless it's going to be you speaking lord i don't want my mind to be thinking unless it's god's thoughts i refuse to think any of the devil thoughts any doubt any of those things come in amen just cast them right out i only want god's thoughts and watch your life trends watch this church transform watch your family transform watch yourself young people watch yourself transform if you will completely surrender to god because that is in fact our biggest battle is that self i said you still want some of your way you still want to get in god's way you still have attendance in god's way because we know the devil is completely rendered powerless the power is there for you to do it it's just that you fight with your old self amen in whether or not you allow god god in your life and work the way that he wants to work amen i just want to close with this statement your worst enemy that's your worst enemy is yourself get yourself out of the way i feel that's the holy spirit get yourself out of the way and watch me work my miracles and then god can go to work how many believe that this morning if you'll get yourself out of the way every man woman and child that is under the all under the holy spirit if you get yourself out of the way well you feel like maybe you are listen i have been preaching for 30 years and i know i still have room that i can make to get out of the way so god can do more greater things in my life amen praise the lord brother brahm says what is a gift this was in one of his prayer lines that i can move my own thinking i can move my own life from me my natural life my soul that's william braham if i can get him out of the way god will use that body to speak we all know brother bannon because soul yield himself to god that he would begin to see visions he would see what people's wrong with him and he would speak and he would have to go back and play the tape he don't know what he said huh how many believes the holy spirit is a little like that for us today the pentecostals used to be so able to get themselves out of the way that's why tongues were so easy to speak in tongues because they knew just how to yield themselves huh how many knows this morning for you to properly worship the lord to sing songs and hymns to him you have to get yourself out of the way amen maybe and on one big secret let me tell you something one big secret i like to do is to close my eyes and worship the lord because if i'm looking at you seeing an amazing grace i'll sweep this out well i have my i have eye contact with you my mind could be somewhere else but you close your eyes you're shut in with god in a secret place and you worship the lord say god help me when i sing that song it's not just words but it's my heart's desire it's i'm worshiping you lord i can truly worship him and praise him when you get out of the way how many please we need to get out of the way so we can worship god so that god can receive oh the praise and the honor and the glory like he should amen thank you brother woody and sister michelle thank you for that special micah and the girls how many that's a blessing mean i thank god i thank god for everybody i mean not because i truly believe the holy spirit and every one of us wants to be a part of edifying the body of god amen find what it is that god wants you to do to be edification to the body of christ because that's what it's all about it's about living for other people not just yourself it's about living for god and to edify to be a blessing to the body of christ amen praise be to god i'm going to read a final scripture and it's found in verse chapter 149 of psalms it says no 150. praise ye the lord very last chapter david wrote in psalms praise ye the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts amen praise the lord how many oh my that god could take a oh a uneducated vile amish person amish guy amen that had lost his way that was in the world god could come do and do what he did in my life i praise him how about you if you were a sin of yours low as low can be you might be like paul was he was the chief of sinners but the mighty hand of god came down upon him it made all the difference when god came down and changed his life amen you begin to praise him say thank you lord thank you lord for saving my soul huh thank you lord for making me who i'm grateful for what god did amen for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of a trumpet praise him with the sultry and the harp praise him with the timbrel and the dance huh god asked us to dance for him once in a while no i won't think you foolish i don't care how much you twist and jerk and jump and carry on i won't think he foolish i might just join you like brother branham did with those women that were out there and dancing and before he knew it he was out there dancing with him all right why because god is worthy how many knows he's worthy of praise folks he's worthy of all the glory and the honor because it's really him that we're all about it's all about him that's right the timbrel and the dance praise him with the string instruments and the organs praise be to god i guess that shoots the amish philosophy all down the road i'm uni no music in the church that's not what god said oh my yeah i gotta i gotta make a fool of myself is that all right at least i'll make a full out of myself here then the next thing if i'm not wrong here listen praise him on the loud upon the loud symbols praise him upon the high sounding symbols [Music] [Applause] get up there up high way up there the loud ones there you go is that wrong am i right the loud sounding simple get right out there praise be to god because he's worthy huh on the loud sounding symbols he said this was the last scripture almost of all the psalms let's get up there and praise god for he's worthy of praise maybe he'll come down and inhabit the praise of his people do you realize that if we all worship god perhaps the way that we should this place would become smokey the glory of god would come down because why you have died to yourself
