[21:52] is looking for hebrews
[21:54] amen hebrews
[21:57] 6 and acts 17 acts 17 verse
[22:01] 31 because he hath appointed
[22:05] a day into which he will judge the world
[22:09] in righteousness by that man whom he
[22:12] hath ordained
[22:14] whereof he hath given assurance
[22:18] unto all men in that he had raised from
[22:22] the dead amen over in hebrews 6
[22:28] we'll begin with verse 17.
[22:36] wherein god willing more abundantly to
[22:39] show unto the heirs of the promised
[22:41] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[22:45] by an oath that by two immutable things
[22:49] in which it was impossible for god to
[22:52] lie
[22:53] we might have strong consolation who
[22:56] have fled
[22:58] for refuge to lay hold upon the hope
[23:00] said
[23:02] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[23:05] soul
[23:06] both sure and steadfast and which
[23:09] entereth
[23:09] into that within the veil
[23:13] whether the forerunner is for us entered
[23:16] even jesus made
[23:17] in high priest forever after the order
[23:20] of melchizedek may god it is blessings
[23:23] to the reading
[23:24] of the word you can be seated
[23:27] amen this evening for a little bit i
[23:29] just want to talk about
[23:31] assurance assurance amen that word just
[23:36] came to my heart and
[23:38] and i began to pray about what the lord
[23:41] wanted me to speak
[23:42] on and of course i thought and just let
[23:44] the holy spirit kind of
[23:45] speak to me and but it fell back again
[23:48] to that same word and he began to just
[23:50] kind of pour a few things out
[23:52] amen on assurance and i just take that
[23:54] as from the lord
[23:56] amen to go in this direction but
[23:58] assurance
[24:00] and on the way to church i talked to
[24:02] siri and asked
[24:03] siri what her version of assurance was i
[24:06] mean of course you know
[24:07] each and every one of us probably if
[24:09] you're not for sure about a word you
[24:12] interpret it yourself you know and you
[24:14] think about what you think it means you
[24:16] know
[24:17] i says well before i get in the pulpit
[24:19] and just tell them what i think it means
[24:20] i better look it up
[24:22] and see what the dictionary of it was
[24:25] amen and so it had a couple different
[24:27] versions it had three different
[24:28] interpretations but i like the last one
[24:31] the best
[24:32] and last interpretation that it gave of
[24:35] what
[24:36] assurance means is insurance
[24:40] specifically life insurance
[24:43] wow what an interpretation of assurance
[24:46] amen so it kind of to me
[24:50] it's something that's sure it's
[24:52] something that makes something sure kind
[24:54] of like a down payment
[24:56] somebody's dead sure they're serious
[24:57] about what's going to happen
[24:59] kind of like brother branham called
[25:01] earnest money perhaps
[25:03] you know we get the earnest of our
[25:04] inheritance amen
[25:07] something that's sure amen it's an
[25:09] assurance
[25:10] i mean they call it insurance so you
[25:12] know where brother branham you remember
[25:14] brother bam when
[25:15] that man came up to him i guess he was
[25:17] his wife's brother or somebody maybe
[25:18] family or friend
[25:20] he came up to him he asked him and he
[25:21] was trying to get him life insurance you
[25:23] know
[25:24] and uh you know he says well i already
[25:26] got insurance
[25:28] you know and you know you would think
[25:30] hey that's a little bit
[25:32] sneaky right there right that's just a
[25:34] little sneaky there and he said oh i
[25:35] didn't know you had insurance yeah i
[25:37] already got insurance
[25:38] you know and you know how brother man
[25:40] did and you know you might have thought
[25:42] well he didn't wasn't honest but
[25:44] actually according to this
[25:45] interpretation of assurance
[25:48] he was exactly right am i right
[25:50] assurance means
[25:52] insurance so yeah i got insurance you
[25:54] know
[25:55] but uh anyway so i like that because
[26:00] you know i think sunday people some of
[26:02] the people i'm not sure
[26:03] which one which story i was telling but
[26:05] i know i never finished a story sunday
[26:07] on one of them so
[26:09] i'm surprised somebody in the head you
[26:11] never finished that story so let's
[26:12] finish this one anyway
[26:14] but anyway so he says you know well
[26:16] brother brian that's awful night you
[26:18] know he talks about assurance he says
[26:20] you know
[26:20] yeah what kind of company what company
[26:22] are you with and he says well i'm
[26:24] with eternal life insurance well i don't
[26:27] believe i've ever heard of that
[26:29] that company you know amen blessed
[26:31] assurance
[26:32] jesus is mine no mother for taste of
[26:34] glory divine
[26:35] oh he says well that's awful nice
[26:37] brother random but guess what that won't
[26:39] put you up there in the graveyard
[26:41] you know and he says well i know that
[26:43] but it'll get me out
[26:47] how many likes that you're more worried
[26:49] about getting out then y'all are getting
[26:50] in
[26:51] else stick you in the ground somehow
[26:52] right but i'm worried about getting out
[26:55] amen but i got to thinking about the day
[26:58] in the hour we're living in
[27:00] and basically and this is something else
[27:02] that happened to me that i thought
[27:04] was really of the lord it kind of was a
[27:05] confirmation to me that
[27:07] the lord wanted me to speak on this
[27:09] because i wrote something down here
[27:12] uh about 30 seconds before david
[27:15] uh sang that first song amen because i
[27:18] thought this would be kind of my theme
[27:20] song
[27:21] tonight and i wrote down here count your
[27:23] blessings name them one by one
[27:26] 30 seconds later brother david started
[27:28] singing that song so i was
[27:29] like we must be on the right wavelength
[27:32] amen
[27:33] because i got to thinking of how how
[27:37] great how great it is to be a christian
[27:41] amen how many really enjoys being a
[27:43] christian
[27:46] i believe one place but abam says what
[27:47] would we do if we was it couldn't be a
[27:49] christian
[27:50] it's the greatest honor amen it's the
[27:53] greatest
[27:54] privilege upon the face of the earth to
[27:57] be a christian
[27:58] amen to be a real genuine
[28:02] christian when you think about
[28:03] everything that comes with it he meant
[28:06] just everything that's involved
[28:08] and i got to thinking about all the
[28:09] blessings i thought about the goodness
[28:11] of god
[28:12] i thought about speaking about the
[28:13] goodness of god how good he is but we
[28:15] know that
[28:16] brother bam says you know a lot of
[28:18] people do preach on how good god is the
[28:19] bible says oh taste that the lord is
[28:21] good how good he is
[28:22] and god really is good god is awesome
[28:25] good
[28:26] he's also a god of justice isn't that
[28:28] right
[28:29] sure he is amen you do wrong and so
[28:31] forth and they'll judge the world for
[28:32] all the wrong that it but
[28:34] he is truly for a real genuine believer
[28:36] that follows him with their whole heart
[28:39] he is an awesome god amen because there
[28:42] are just so
[28:43] many blessings that come along with
[28:46] being a christians
[28:47] and one of those blessings is that we
[28:49] have
[28:50] an assurance amen
[28:54] amen let me see how he talked about
[28:59] paul talked about it in hebrews he
[29:01] talked that we have fled
[29:03] amen for refuge in a world
[29:08] we know that the on the the opposite of
[29:12] something that's sure
[29:14] is something that's unsure or uncertain
[29:18] am i right and we're living in a world
[29:21] of
[29:21] unsure things things are
[29:24] not sure nothing sure
[29:29] the fact is that none of us even have a
[29:32] promise of
[29:33] making it out those double doors there's
[29:37] absolutely nothing that gives you a
[29:38] promise that you're going to be able to
[29:39] walk home tonight
[29:41] huh isn't that right or be in heaven one
[29:43] more day
[29:45] so life there's no assurance of being
[29:48] alive or staying in life here outside of
[29:50] god protecting you
[29:52] how many knows that when your card is
[29:54] called whatever it might be
[29:55] you know different ones that fell over
[29:57] and brother man me died right there you
[29:59] never know
[30:00] you know and so there's so many so many
[30:03] things that's not sure
[30:05] in the world and you and i live in i
[30:07] think one of the great blessings is
[30:09] and and i you know one thing that
[30:12] brother bam said
[30:13] is is that jesus christ for one thing in
[30:16] the way that he came and showed himself
[30:18] alive
[30:18] in our generation and the things that he
[30:21] did
[30:22] it should give us rapturing faith
[30:25] it gives and it gives us an assurance
[30:29] in other words it i i like that don't
[30:32] anybody
[30:33] any human being that doesn't like
[30:34] something that's sure
[30:36] there's just something wrong with them
[30:38] something that's
[30:39] solid amen
[30:43] and so i got it looking up this this
[30:46] this
[30:46] thought a little bit about uncertainty i
[30:49] knew the prophet had preached on it
[30:50] and he preached on a message called the
[30:53] uncertain sound
[30:55] and of course he went through everything
[30:57] but it went through everything almost
[30:59] even further
[31:00] it was nations or especially with war
[31:02] and
[31:03] and the war the things that's going on
[31:05] and i guess back then everybody
[31:08] no doubt they were pretty scared i think
[31:09] in 1962 was it 62 that we had
[31:12] such a close brush with uh with russia
[31:16] you know and cuba the cuba crisis you
[31:18] remember that
[31:20] called the cuba crisis man they were on
[31:21] the verge of a nuclear
[31:23] you know uh holocaust and so forth and
[31:26] and everybody was uh you know brother
[31:28] bam says you know that they
[31:30] were advising everybody to go in their
[31:32] backyard and and making
[31:34] you know bomb shelters and so forth and
[31:36] he says man you could have a
[31:38] a bomb go off way down in louisiana and
[31:40] he says you'd still die from the fallout
[31:42] up here
[31:44] so he says there's nothing sure there's
[31:46] you know you you don't count on that he
[31:48] says that's all foolishness
[31:50] yeah you know and he said talk about how
[31:53] that even war is unsure you you know you
[31:55] talk about how that you'll have a war if
[31:57] you have a war
[31:58] you know it won't last long he says one
[32:00] this long lasts about one minute
[32:02] because he said it it only take one
[32:05] person to push
[32:06] one button in that right and they're all
[32:08] watching their screens he says and
[32:10] when one comes over you know right rush
[32:13] almost
[32:14] another time if you go on youtube or
[32:16] wherever and you look at all the times
[32:18] that we came almost and how close we
[32:20] came to a complete wipeout amen it was
[32:22] amazing how many times
[32:24] maybe we would send up a rocket or
[32:26] whatever we were doing the test and we
[32:27] didn't let them know and
[32:28] it was coming their way you know they
[32:30] were like a red alert
[32:32] get ready get ready if that thing comes
[32:33] too far we're standing and come to find
[32:35] out hey sorry we didn't let you guys
[32:37] know
[32:38] oh thanks you know how many knows that
[32:40] if god chose to end it all he wouldn't
[32:42] take a whole lot
[32:43] that's a little misunderstanding he you
[32:45] know it's him that holds me back i mean
[32:47] knows that
[32:48] but he says they're watching those
[32:49] screens and he says one of these days
[32:51] you know
[32:51] you know just one person amen doing that
[32:54] and that whole thing will be going
[32:56] up in smoke because there's not you know
[32:58] the kind of war they have nowadays won't
[33:00] last
[33:01] won't last very long amen but i like
[33:04] this he says but the church don't have
[33:06] to worry you ain't going to be here then
[33:07] anyhow that's one thing
[33:09] sure amen that's right you're not
[33:12] concerned because of the certainty of
[33:14] god's promise
[33:16] to us how many knows that he's not going
[33:17] to destroy
[33:19] the righteous with the wicked
[33:22] amen he talked about now listen what he
[33:25] says we're
[33:25] living in a day of great uncertainty we
[33:28] all know that the day
[33:29] of uncertainty and the time of
[33:32] uncertainty and i guarantee you
[33:34] i mean you and i are probably seeing
[33:36] more of that than what even he did
[33:40] amen and we'll in the next years ahead
[33:42] of us
[33:43] we'll probably see things that we never
[33:46] heard of or thought of
[33:48] it's very uncertain i watched the news
[33:51] just a little bit today and they said
[33:53] they have more military in washington
[33:55] because of this vote that's taken place
[33:57] i think it was today uh
[33:59] more military in washington dc than all
[34:01] of afghanistan and
[34:03] a couple of those countries in our own
[34:05] capital just to keep order
[34:08] because they're afraid of what might
[34:09] happen
[34:11] uncertainty we've never had that before
[34:14] we never had to do that before
[34:16] what's going to happen next total
[34:17] uncertainty in the world
[34:20] but i get to thinking about how that a
[34:22] believer
[34:23] and where you stand how many knows that
[34:25] jesus talked about a rock and
[34:27] and somebody building their house upon a
[34:29] rock and another one building it on sand
[34:31] and that right and if you build it upon
[34:33] a rock you're building it upon
[34:35] certainty and paul here talking about
[34:38] how that we have
[34:39] fled for refuge to lay hold upon the
[34:42] hope that's set
[34:43] fast and this hope that we have
[34:46] as an anchor of the soul both
[34:50] sure and steadfast
[34:53] i mean please say something that's sure
[34:57] i like that and steadfast and that which
[35:00] entereth
[35:01] within the veil amen that assurance is
[35:05] something in here
[35:06] people that live by the outside boy they
[35:09] get pulled here and pulled there and
[35:11] everywhere you got to have the anchor
[35:12] down in here
[35:14] you got to have that assurance down here
[35:18] amen praise the lord so notice what he
[35:21] says again
[35:22] so he says we all know that the day of
[35:24] uncertainty time of uncertainty
[35:26] i don't believe that there ever was a
[35:28] time since the time of the garden
[35:30] of eden i do not believe there's ever
[35:33] time
[35:34] or a space of time with so much
[35:36] uncertainty
[35:37] as today because there's not
[35:40] even one hope left of the natural
[35:44] world today amen
[35:48] praise the lord so uncertainty
[35:51] all around us he talked about uh you
[35:54] know about
[35:54] national life now there's no certainty
[35:57] there he talked about
[35:58] home life in that right he talked about
[36:01] marriages and how
[36:02] uncertain marriages is people that you
[36:05] never thought would get a divorce get
[36:07] divorced
[36:08] amen and a lot of times you find that
[36:10] it's as much women a lot of times
[36:12] as it is men amen but what you just
[36:15] ain't no certainty
[36:17] you know that and so church life he
[36:20] talked about church life and
[36:21] how uncertain church life is amen people
[36:24] just put their name on the book but yet
[36:26] the bible talks about
[36:27] they're coming that day and they'll say
[36:28] you know have one on this that or the
[36:30] other
[36:30] amen and they'll be disappointed it's an
[36:34] age of deception amen
[36:38] oh my praise the lord
[36:42] so we're blessed how many we believe
[36:43] that we're very
[36:45] blessed people people have all kinds of
[36:48] things people have a lot people have
[36:50] this people have that
[36:51] there's rich people and so forth but
[36:53] listen the problem of god he says you
[36:55] know when he was in that little trailer
[36:56] and all roberts billy graham and all of
[36:58] them had all of these multi-million
[37:00] programs and here he had a little
[37:01] typewriter
[37:02] in the back of his trailer and he says
[37:04] boy what do i have i don't have my heart
[37:06] i don't have nothing and the voice spoke
[37:09] back he
[37:10] what did the voice say to brother madam
[37:12] the same thing
[37:13] that you'll read in the genesis there
[37:15] where god told abraham
[37:17] he says you know i am your
[37:20] portion
[37:24] i was looking at brother bam somewhere
[37:25] where he talked about how that you know
[37:27] he says don't
[37:28] you can't trust riches and so forth he
[37:30] says really the only person that's
[37:32] really rich
[37:33] is somebody that has christ that's the
[37:36] only person that's rich is somebody that
[37:38] has the lord jesus christ
[37:40] everything else is uncertain so he told
[37:42] him look i
[37:43] am your portion that's why i say i
[37:46] believe that
[37:47] if you have him oh my you ought to be
[37:49] the happiest person
[37:50] in the world to know that you are his
[37:53] that you belong to god let the world
[37:57] have what it wants as long as you have
[37:59] god
[37:59] you have that assurance for one thing
[38:02] how many knows
[38:03] jesus says you know that uh the gentiles
[38:06] they seek after the clothes that they
[38:08] wear the food that they eat he says
[38:10] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[38:12] his righteousness
[38:13] and all these things shall be added unto
[38:15] you
[38:17] how many knows he's our caretaker he
[38:20] knows oh i like that i like when
[38:22] when god does those little things that
[38:24] he shows you that hey i'm right there
[38:26] i'm with you because i don't know you
[38:28] let you can see whatever you want to see
[38:30] but i want to see jesus
[38:31] because jesus said the world ain't going
[38:33] to see me no more but you will see me
[38:35] i want this don't you want to have the
[38:37] assurance that i know that god
[38:39] is working in my life i can see him in
[38:43] myself i can see him in others i can see
[38:45] him in other people
[38:46] i see jesus working it's amazing just
[38:49] coming out to preach a sermon like this
[38:51] and
[38:51] and i think boy i don't want to ask
[38:53] brother david maybe to sing that song
[38:55] amen count your blessings you know and
[38:57] there you come the first song the county
[38:58] blessing
[38:59] i'm saying thank you lord how many knows
[39:01] he knows all about he cares
[39:03] about every detail about us
[39:06] amen praise the lord
[39:11] god is good full of
[39:14] assurance we have assurance
[39:17] i like that
[39:21] amen the psalm
[39:25] says it this way he said blessed
[39:29] blessed assurance
[39:32] jesus is mine oh what a
[39:36] foretaste of glory divine
[39:41] oh my
[39:47] if i'm not wrong my
[39:50] memory serves me right he talked he
[39:52] brotherham told us that
[39:54] heaven is consist gonna consistent of a
[39:57] church service with the atmosphere of
[39:59] the holy ghost
[40:00] only many more times isn't that right
[40:03] so our church service in the atmosphere
[40:05] of the holy ghost
[40:06] that's foretaste of glory divine
[40:10] amen i remember in one of my dreams i've
[40:13] had of course i dream every night but
[40:14] i've had i've had several dreams of
[40:16] actually going in the rapture
[40:18] and i was just preaching away and i was
[40:21] saying you know this is what the prophet
[40:22] said it's
[40:23] like a service just magnified many more
[40:26] times
[40:27] and i was going and i was leaving and i
[40:29] was going up and i was flying through
[40:30] the air and i was just
[40:31] rejoicing and praising god
[40:35] leaving the world just rejoicing and
[40:37] preaching and saying that's exactly the
[40:39] truth that's just how it is
[40:41] hallelujah huh
[40:44] because that's truly what heaven is
[40:46] jesus is mine blessed assurance
[40:49] jesus is mine because the holy ghost
[40:51] jesus
[40:52] in you is a foretaste of glory divine
[40:57] let me believe that that sweetness of
[40:59] the holy spirit
[41:00] amen that peace that passes
[41:02] understanding
[41:04] it is a foretaste of glory to
[41:07] mine what a blessed thing no wonder they
[41:10] could write a song about it
[41:12] about this blessed assurance knowing
[41:15] that jesus
[41:16] is mine amen that i don't have to be on
[41:19] the shifting's hands
[41:21] let me just go one mother one other
[41:23] thing that just comes to mind it means
[41:24] something else that i know and that is
[41:26] that the greatest miracle that jesus can
[41:29] do for a person
[41:30] is to forgive them of their sins
[41:33] to change their nature to make a man
[41:36] that's a drunk and a brawler and a
[41:38] beater of his wife and not mistreating
[41:40] his children
[41:41] everything else to change in that man to
[41:44] be a nice and sweet and loving and kind
[41:47] to forgive him of his sin to change his
[41:49] name that's the greatest miracle
[41:51] the change in nature to save us all
[41:55] amen so oh my we could sit here tonight
[41:57] we could think about
[41:58] how blessed we are amen because of
[42:02] all the blessings that he bestowed upon
[42:04] us
[42:05] how good god is and what kind of an
[42:09] assurance that we have
[42:10] in the midst of a rocking world
[42:14] i mean it's like it would be like
[42:17] the earth just rumbling below us and we
[42:20] just having our faith
[42:21] in god amen
[42:24] when i thought about this sermon i
[42:25] thought about daniel i thought about
[42:28] the three hebrew children amen when
[42:31] daniel
[42:31] no doubt when you i can just imagine
[42:33] this is just an imagination
[42:35] but i can imagine daniel being escorted
[42:39] over to the lions then amen
[42:42] and as he was amen going towards that
[42:45] thou lions then he could have been
[42:47] singing exxon
[42:48] on christ the solid rock i stand
[42:52] of other ground is sinking sand
[42:57] why because he had the assurance that he
[42:59] was in god's care
[43:01] where he was on a solid rock that ain't
[43:04] no
[43:04] line gonna scare it out of him though he
[43:07] goes right to the door of death and
[43:09] perhaps into death
[43:10] it's not going to me move him because
[43:13] he's got that
[43:14] blessed assurance jesus was his
[43:19] he was prayed up he had that assurance
[43:21] that unmovable
[43:23] assurance you know age when everything
[43:26] is moving
[43:27] the believer should not be moving but
[43:30] closer
[43:30] to the lord amen
[43:34] amen only moving closer to the lord i
[43:37] thought about the three hebrew children
[43:39] amen once again my imagination takes me
[43:42] to three hebrew children
[43:43] and as they was going along huh amen as
[43:46] they was being escorted up to the great
[43:49] fire perhaps they had turned over to the
[43:52] soldiers and said hey soldiers i hope
[43:54] you have
[43:55] fire insurance
[43:59] huh because we got blessed assurance
[44:02] jesus
[44:03] he'll take care of us i hope you got
[44:06] assurance
[44:08] huh we could say that to this whole
[44:11] world
[44:12] i hope you got assurance
[44:15] because there's a great fall right up
[44:17] ahead and if you don't have that
[44:19] assurance
[44:21] huh
[44:24] praise the lord there is a there is a
[44:28] there is a cable let's just say that
[44:30] there's a cable stretched across the
[44:31] niagara falls
[44:34] and you can't reach it all right nobody
[44:36] can reach it from the water
[44:38] but everybody's fixing the head towers
[44:40] that niagara falls
[44:42] but the christian has a special harness
[44:45] on
[44:46] all right and they have a little uh a
[44:48] cable that sticks
[44:50] straight up about six foot and on that
[44:53] six foot there's a hook on it and that's
[44:56] just about exactly the height that that
[44:58] cable is
[44:59] and just before we go into that
[45:01] tribulation period
[45:02] we're promised to get picked up amen
[45:06] we've got a special look we've got the
[45:07] assurance
[45:08] that we don't have to worry about the
[45:10] bombs we don't have to worry about
[45:12] amen the judgment
[45:15] why because we've got assurance blessed
[45:18] assurance
[45:20] amen paul said our assurance is that
[45:23] jesus rose from the dead
[45:25] he said to god listen
[45:29] where if he hath given assurance
[45:32] unto all men
[45:36] in that he has raised him from the dead
[45:39] praise be to god hallelujah
[45:44] all right now let's look at something
[45:46] else
[45:48] as we think about of course the believer
[45:51] is not supposed to go through the
[45:52] tribulation period isn't that right
[45:56] amen but in the future home brother bam
[45:59] said that
[46:00] this fire that's coming
[46:03] this fire that he describes as both
[46:06] supernatural and natural fire
[46:08] it's going to destroy everything
[46:11] malachi 4 talk about how did everything
[46:14] finally get burned
[46:16] is that right the whole world is going
[46:18] to get burnt all that
[46:20] wickedly shall be ashes under the soles
[46:23] of your feet
[46:26] but abandonment future home says every
[46:28] sinner all
[46:29] sin all devils all evil
[46:33] everything that's evil everything that's
[46:36] wicked
[46:37] is going to be burnt that right
[46:41] and listen and if that
[46:45] evil is in you guess what's going to
[46:47] happen
[46:49] you're going to get burned
[46:52] if there's evil in you because all the
[46:55] wicked shall be burned how many know
[46:56] that all the wicked shall be burned
[46:59] all the wicked all the unbelievers
[47:02] all them that do iniquity amen
[47:05] they'll all be burned there's a promise
[47:09] of that
[47:10] amen but you know for the believer
[47:15] how many know that the fire is here
[47:18] tonight
[47:20] the holy ghost is here tonight he's in
[47:23] services he's in
[47:24] wherever you are whenever you're driving
[47:28] down the road and the holy speaker
[47:29] spirit speaks to your heart and says
[47:31] look
[47:31] you know you're not doing what you ought
[47:33] to do you're not doing this right or you
[47:36] do whatever it is
[47:37] huh that's the holy spirit trying to
[47:40] burn
[47:41] the evil out of our hearts
[47:44] because how many believe that we don't
[47:46] want any evil
[47:48] in our heart we don't want no wickedness
[47:50] in our heart
[47:51] because it's all going to burn praise be
[47:54] to god
[47:57] amen i love that story of
[48:00] back in the western days of how this big
[48:03] wagon train was going out west and there
[48:05] was in this open prairie of this
[48:07] beautiful field of grass
[48:10] all this dead grass i believe is what
[48:12] i'm i'm believing that it is it was all
[48:14] a bunch of dead grass and it was
[48:15] going through this grass and all of a
[48:17] sudden the prairie fire came up
[48:19] and that fire was coming that way and
[48:20] can you imagine the flames just
[48:22] a billowing everywhere as far as you
[48:24] could see you couldn't go back and
[48:26] go back to the river you you couldn't go
[48:29] nowhere huh
[48:31] and somebody was wise you know right
[48:35] and they begin to light a little bit of
[48:38] that prairie fire right here
[48:40] no doubt a lot of the men with their
[48:41] shovels and everything controlled that
[48:43] fire right
[48:44] and just made it spread out spread out
[48:46] and as it spread out they didn't let it
[48:48] burn this way just let it burn that way
[48:50] let it burn that way and they got all of
[48:52] their wagons in there
[48:54] huh it was already burnt and that little
[48:57] girl i believe it was was just going up
[48:59] oh we're gonna die we're gonna burn
[49:01] we're gonna die
[49:02] and the little boy says what fear not
[49:04] little sister
[49:05] fear not don't worry because we're
[49:08] standing where the fire has already been
[49:11] now he knows the feeling the feeling
[49:14] when the fire was coming
[49:16] was like oh oh my it's horrible it's
[49:19] terrible isn't that right
[49:21] but the feeling that they had after they
[49:24] were in it
[49:24] they were like don't worry don't have no
[49:28] fear you have the assurance that you're
[49:31] not gonna
[49:32] burn it can't burn here anymore because
[49:34] the fire's already been here
[49:38] amen that's the way it is with the
[49:41] center
[49:42] a sinner or a backslider that still has
[49:45] sin
[49:45] in his heart he knows he's not right
[49:47] we've got yeah you got something to be
[49:49] afraid of
[49:51] you got something to worry about because
[49:53] you're you know something in there and
[49:55] still's gonna have to get burned out of
[49:57] there
[49:58] you're still in danger but after the
[50:01] fire the holy ghost comes in there and
[50:03] cleans that out
[50:05] he quick cleans out malice he cleans out
[50:08] bitterness he cleans out hatred and
[50:11] variants and
[50:12] amen and lust and whatever it might be
[50:15] burns all of that out it's all gone
[50:18] then you can have that comfort hey
[50:21] i ain't got to worry about anything
[50:24] because i'm standing where that fire has
[50:25] already been
[50:27] there's no wickedness in vineyard to
[50:29] burn
[50:30] amen how many wants to be there lord let
[50:33] that be me let there be
[50:34] where there is no wickedness in me to
[50:36] burn
[50:37] i have the assurance that i don't have
[50:40] to be in the fire
[50:42] because i'm where the fire has already
[50:44] been praise be to god
[50:48] amen hallelujah i love the lord
[50:51] thank you all for praying for me amen
[50:53] because i just i just want to be a
[50:55] blessing to y'all

[51:00] preach and i hope it does you good amen
[51:05] because i'll tell you what when this
[51:06] lord shows me that stuff
[51:08] amen well amen
[51:12] god is good and i just love the lord and
[51:15] i know you do too
[51:17] i'm glad to be a christian
[51:20] i'm glad that i'm not a muslim
[51:24] i'm glad i'm not a buddha or
[51:27] any other religion think about this
[51:29] going on streaming
[51:31] any other religion let me get a little
[51:35] more detailed i'm glad
[51:37] i'm not a baptist or a methodist
[51:41] or amish or mennonite
[51:44] or pentecostal or catholic
[51:47] or any of those religions
[51:51] i'm glad i'm not because they don't have
[51:55] an assurance a prophet of god
[51:58] vindicated by god after he would say
[52:02] and declare them just to be lodges
[52:06] huh just a place to meet just the lodge
[52:10] declared them dead declare them to have
[52:13] put christ outside
[52:15] isn't that right and then after he said
[52:18] no things
[52:19] jesus himself would come down and to
[52:21] begin to discern the thoughts and
[52:22] intents of the heart
[52:23] just like he did with the woman at the
[52:25] well did the very sign of the messiah
[52:28] never stop vindicating the prophet of
[52:31] huh said they're a bunch of harlots and
[52:34] prostitutes
[52:35] claiming to be married to christ but
[52:37] they still want their man-made creeds
[52:38] and dogmas
[52:40] huh so i'm glad i'm not
[52:43] because i want to tell you something
[52:45] that's not really sure is it
[52:47] after a prophet of god comes and
[52:48] declares that there's not a lot of
[52:50] assurance in that
[52:53] not a lot of assurance at all we never
[52:56] think about this how about the when he
[52:58] was in india i believe it was and
[53:00] and and he challenged the sikhs the
[53:02] chains and
[53:03] all of those religions is that right
[53:06] said any of your gods and can come up
[53:08] here
[53:09] and open this blind man's eyes then your
[53:12] religion's right and i'll follow
[53:14] your religion what a challenge
[53:19] come on folks listen what would we have
[53:22] done
[53:23] if we'd have been the days of elijah
[53:25] when he challenged those 400 prophets of
[53:26] baal
[53:27] remember that and said let the god who
[53:29] is god come down and consume
[53:31] the sacrifice isn't that right and they
[53:34] cut themselves to 400 prophets they did
[53:36] this and they cut themselves they cried
[53:39] and they screamed and everything else
[53:41] and the prophet says you know maybe he
[53:42] went on vacation
[53:45] i'm sorry but it sounds just a little
[53:47] sarcastic almost a little smart
[53:50] but that's okay god gets that way
[53:52] sometime maybe he's on vacation y'all
[53:55] maybe you need to scream a little louder
[53:59] huh maybe you don't know this oh they
[54:03] cut themselves and screamed and hollered
[54:05] and still
[54:05] no fire came down huh
[54:09] the same way we got pretty excited
[54:12] listen
[54:13] evening like tabernacle but when i tell
[54:15] you the story of the same thing
[54:16] happening today
[54:17] i mean it believes you ought to excite
[54:18] us a little bit it ought to make us
[54:20] like that's right praise be to god i'm
[54:24] glad that i'm following the
[54:26] religion that was proven right
[54:29] i have an assurance to know that it is
[54:32] sponsored by jesus himself
[54:36] how many beliefs of religion that we
[54:37] follow is sponsored by jesus himself
[54:40] it was thus saith the lord
[54:43] it is thus saith the lord and we have an
[54:47] assurance
[54:48] that we're going to meet the lord in the
[54:50] air
[54:52] now all those sikhs all those chains all
[54:55] of those buddha all of those religions
[54:58] amen they couldn't come up there they
[55:01] wouldn't come up there and try to open
[55:02] that blind man's eyes
[55:04] because they knew they couldn't do it
[55:07] and the prophet of god
[55:08] couldn't do it but he had seen a vision
[55:11] from the lord jesus christ that jesus
[55:13] would do it
[55:14] now the lord jesus christ who i
[55:16] represent
[55:18] will open his blind man's eyes because
[55:21] the scripture said the works that i
[55:22] do shall they do also isn't that right
[55:26] and greater works than these tell you
[55:30] do amen what did he say
[55:33] if he don't open this blind man's eyes
[55:36] i'm a false prophet you need to put it
[55:38] on my back and run me out of the country
[55:42] huh i'll say this tonight maybe brother
[55:45] banham should have said and if you're
[55:46] wrong then you need to stop your
[55:48] religion huh you need to quit what
[55:50] you're doing and start following this
[55:52] jesus
[55:54] if i'm willing to follow yours you need
[55:55] to be willing and how many knows 30
[55:57] 000 raw heathens gave their lives to the
[56:00] lord in one meeting
[56:03] 30 000 converts
[56:07] 10 times the size
[56:11] of acts 2 pentecost 10 times greater
[56:15] greater than d shall you do
[56:18] thirty thousand not three thousand amen
[56:22] how many glad for the blessed assurance
[56:24] jesus is mine i know what a fortress of
[56:26] glory divine
[56:27] that's why brother branham says you know
[56:29] with the signs the wonders of indication
[56:31] the proof that jesus is alive
[56:33] and we're following the right path you
[56:34] ought to be the happiest people upon the
[56:36] face of the earth
[56:38] happy means blessed see so you are how
[56:41] many believes you are
[56:42] the most blessed people upon the face of
[56:44] the earth
[56:45] you sitting here tonight you streaming i
[56:47] believe the message in the hour
[56:49] you are the most blessed people upon the
[56:52] face of the earth
[56:54] the most blessed and we got to take it a
[56:58] whole lot more serious than what we do
[57:00] amen praise be to god
[57:04] what a blessed assurance that jesus
[57:07] is alive as i was studying this message
[57:11] the thought comes to my mind
[57:14] well now what if brother branham would
[57:16] have just got up here like oral roberts
[57:17] billy graham
[57:19] uh and preached the gospel at altar
[57:22] calls
[57:23] really nobody get healed or anything
[57:25] perhaps just sinners give their heart to
[57:27] the lord
[57:28] no signs no wonders no discernment
[57:31] it had been a little different wouldn't
[57:33] it
[57:35] yeah while it would have been good while
[57:38] it would have been right as long as it's
[57:39] according to the word because that's the
[57:41] gospel preach the gospel to every
[57:42] all nations in it right but jesus did a
[57:45] little bit more than that
[57:47] not that he had to but he did just to
[57:49] get the people to believe
[57:51] he would then come down and vindicate
[57:53] and prove it with signs
[57:54] and wonders because if you look at acts
[57:58] i believe it was in acts or matthew 28
[58:01] and it says they went out
[58:02] preaching with signs following
[58:05] those signs followed then jesus himself
[58:08] would come down and improve it
[58:10] and show that it was absolutely the
[58:12] truth not just because it was according
[58:14] to the word
[58:14] amen that's good it has to be but then
[58:17] god would come and vindicate it that
[58:18] make the difference between
[58:20] all roberts billy graham and brother
[58:21] brennan hello
[58:23] i would come down and vindicate his
[58:24] prophet amen
[58:28] praise the lord that's brothers and
[58:31] sisters
[58:32] i'm so thankful for that assurance
[58:35] you know let me say this to all
[58:38] believers
[58:39] all believers all message followers
[58:44] and i didn't have the time but if you
[58:45] know the message
[58:48] i'm not sure which one it is even in but
[58:51] remember how that brother banh said you
[58:53] know
[58:53] the earnest that actually
[58:56] healing is our earnest of the
[58:59] resurrection
[59:00] in other words if you have healing
[59:03] happening and so forth it shows you that
[59:05] there's a resurrection
[59:06] because if you cannot just heal the body
[59:10] he could also raise the whole body up
[59:12] that right so it was a sign
[59:14] of of that and then he also he makes a
[59:16] statement he says
[59:17] that because of the fact that you and i
[59:20] are longing for perfection
[59:22] and because of the fact that we are
[59:24] coming your body is coming more
[59:26] subject to the word of god he says
[59:28] that's also a sign to you
[59:31] right that there is a resurrection for
[59:33] you
[59:34] huh because our bodies are coming
[59:37] subject to
[59:38] the word of god i could find that i know
[59:40] he said it
[59:41] it is a earnest of your resurrection
[59:44] is that hey i want to follow that word i
[59:46] want to have the word
[59:48] living in me amen and you become more
[59:51] and more and more like that because
[59:53] we're ultimately going to be just like
[59:55] jesus to medium
[59:56] that's also a way that you can tell and
[59:59] that you can have an assurance
[1:00:01] that you're heading for the rapture
[1:00:03] because we know that anybody that's
[1:00:05] going the other way
[1:00:06] hello falling away getting cold or
[1:00:08] getting cold
[1:00:09] that you can't expect a rapture for that
[1:00:12] but somebody just getting closer and
[1:00:14] closer and closer and closer
[1:00:16] that's a really good sign that you're
[1:00:18] hitting the right way you got done this
[1:00:19] year and say you're going to be in that
[1:00:20] rapture
[1:00:21] amen let me talk to you one more group
[1:00:24] tonight we'll we'll close early tonight
[1:00:26] but listen one more group i want to talk
[1:00:28] about
[1:00:29] and that is when brandon bam went beyond
[1:00:30] the curtain of time
[1:00:32] he would be on the curtain of time and
[1:00:34] he was lifted up out of his bed
[1:00:36] about 20 feet up amen he said that's
[1:00:39] about where they are
[1:00:41] they see other dimensions not all that
[1:00:43] far away it's just about 20 feet up
[1:00:46] and he's seen millions of people
[1:00:49] and we found out that that was all these
[1:00:52] converts
[1:00:53] all those who fought follow this message
[1:00:57] all those he brought to the lord amen
[1:01:00] all of his converts
[1:01:01] millions of them is that right and they
[1:01:04] talked about how the angel says you know
[1:01:06] before
[1:01:07] you can go meet him and so forth you're
[1:01:09] going to have to be judged for what you
[1:01:10] preached
[1:01:12] as a leader you're going to have to be
[1:01:13] judged about what you have preached
[1:01:16] now i don't know about you but that
[1:01:17] would be kind of scary you'd be like
[1:01:20] wow really i'm going to have to be
[1:01:21] judged about what i have preached but
[1:01:23] brother branham for brother brandon
[1:01:24] maybe it's not scary
[1:01:26] because what did he reply back to the
[1:01:28] angel he says well
[1:01:30] is paul going to have to be judged
[1:01:33] and the angel says yep he's going to
[1:01:35] have to be judged too
[1:01:37] for what he preached and brother branham
[1:01:40] was like
[1:01:41] hallelujah well glory to god he didn't
[1:01:44] have any fear
[1:01:46] he didn't he wasn't scared he had
[1:01:49] assurance he
[1:01:50] he knew he says well then
[1:01:53] if paul goes in there because i just
[1:01:56] preached with
[1:01:57] outrage hey
[1:02:01] amen and what happened somebody tell me
[1:02:04] what happened
[1:02:06] what did the multitude out there say
[1:02:10] we're resting on that that's right
[1:02:14] they all said we're resting on that we
[1:02:19] have the assurance
[1:02:20] that what you preached was exactly
[1:02:23] according to
[1:02:24] the scripture hallelujah acts 2 38 where
[1:02:28] paul baptized them in the name of jesus
[1:02:30] christ
[1:02:30] we baptize them in the name of jesus
[1:02:32] christ amen what paul
[1:02:34] said you got to put your name on the
[1:02:35] book to make it to heaven we preach that
[1:02:37] you got to put your name on the book to
[1:02:38] make it to heaven
[1:02:40] but he didn't preach that did he no paul
[1:02:43] said by one spirit are we all baptized
[1:02:45] into one body
[1:02:46] not some name on the book amen you must
[1:02:50] be born again
[1:02:51] he had the confidence that he just
[1:02:53] preached what the prophet god what paul
[1:02:55] preached
[1:02:56] because the bible says if anybody come
[1:02:57] and preach anything else
[1:02:59] if he's an angel from heaven let him be
[1:03:01] a curse amen
[1:03:04] he preached just what paul preached
[1:03:05] predestination
[1:03:07] he preached for knowledge he preached
[1:03:09] all those things
[1:03:11] and you and i tonight
[1:03:15] when we go witness to people or talk to
[1:03:17] anybody where do we take them
[1:03:19] huh right straight to the scriptures
[1:03:23] take them to revelations where there
[1:03:24] were seven angels of god
[1:03:26] isn't that right and there's seven
[1:03:27] angels of god seven church ages
[1:03:30] we've taken the malachi for it they'll
[1:03:32] come to burn us in heaven
[1:03:33] but yet i will come and restore the
[1:03:34] faith of the children back to the
[1:03:36] fathers
[1:03:37] isn't that right everything just like
[1:03:39] the bible taught
[1:03:40] everything because amen there's no other
[1:03:43] salvation listen
[1:03:44] man people's got a salvation in their
[1:03:46] churches they got salvation you got to
[1:03:48] be honest you got to be men or not you
[1:03:49] got to be baptised you got to be this
[1:03:51] no you ain't got me none of that you got
[1:03:53] to be messaged no you've got to be in
[1:03:55] christ
[1:03:57] you got to be in christ he says that's
[1:03:58] the only salvation there's only places
[1:04:00] safety is
[1:04:01] in christ jesus amen
[1:04:06] and you and i have the assurance
[1:04:11] we're resting on that how
[1:04:14] when i if i was to live long enough to
[1:04:17] take my dying breath
[1:04:19] i'd be resting on that amen
[1:04:22] that was according to what paul taught
[1:04:26] amen how many is glad for an assurance
[1:04:31] that
[1:04:31] we already know where you go
[1:04:34] beyond that last breath
[1:04:38] you know other people they still wonder
[1:04:40] what in the world is going to happen
[1:04:41] with them
[1:04:43] anybody that don't believe this message
[1:04:46] you will probably not believe the story
[1:04:48] probably not believe that beyond this
[1:04:50] line just about 20 feet up or all the
[1:04:53] saints that have gone on before waiting
[1:04:55] and so forth they're very much
[1:04:56] alive shaking hands with one another and
[1:04:59] just waiting for the coming of the lord
[1:05:01] so you might be a spook spirit out there
[1:05:03] wandering soul i don't know what you
[1:05:05] might think that you are
[1:05:06] where you go but with this message you
[1:05:08] know where you go
[1:05:09] because god transfer transported the
[1:05:12] prophet of god
[1:05:13] over there and let him see him he came
[1:05:16] back and he looked at his body he says
[1:05:18] do i have to go back into that pest
[1:05:19] house
[1:05:20] don't make me go back there huh
[1:05:23] as a believer as a christian that's what
[1:05:25] we have the assurance that if we go by
[1:05:27] out of this body there's another body
[1:05:30] waiting for us we have that assurance we
[1:05:31] know where we're going
[1:05:33] the rest of the world doesn't know where
[1:05:35] would we be brothers and sisters if it
[1:05:37] wasn't be for the message
[1:05:38] god has sent us in this generation where
[1:05:40] we be at
[1:05:41] darkness well which church do i go to
[1:05:45] what should i believe what really is
[1:05:47] right we'd be asking those questions to
[1:05:49] your dying day
[1:05:50] you wouldn't really know but you ain't
[1:05:52] got to wonder that because we have the
[1:05:54] assurance
[1:05:54] that jesus came and he proved himself
[1:05:57] alive
[1:05:58] after two thousand years he opened he
[1:06:00] opened
[1:06:01] the deaf ears he opened he had blinded
[1:06:03] eyes
[1:06:08] i love the story of where this girl i
[1:06:10] don't know if she even had
[1:06:12] hardly had any eyeballs but and when he
[1:06:15] uh
[1:06:16] he prayed for her eyes he prayed that he
[1:06:19] she would be able to see
[1:06:21] and then he asked oh what color eyes is
[1:06:24] it that you want it
[1:06:28] even to the color of the eye hey folks
[1:06:30] that's not a man
[1:06:31] that's jesus amen that's what jesus did
[1:06:35] he came and did the very same things to
[1:06:37] prove to you
[1:06:39] and to me that he is alive
[1:06:43] amen how many believes he is alive he's
[1:06:45] real
[1:06:46] and like paul says listen whereof he has
[1:06:50] given us an assurance unto all men
[1:06:53] because that he has raised him from the
[1:06:56] dead
[1:06:56] and after 2 000 years i'll say this that
[1:06:59] he has once again
[1:07:00] proven that he's alive and he's above
[1:07:03] every religion
[1:07:04] he was he's he is above every religion
[1:07:07] and he faced every religion
[1:07:10] now a muslim if you come against the
[1:07:12] muslim faith or disadd or the other
[1:07:14] perhaps leave them but they want to kill
[1:07:15] you
[1:07:16] but brother branham openly challenge
[1:07:19] them
[1:07:20] you muslim you buddha you seek eugene
[1:07:22] all of you priests
[1:07:24] all of y'all i challenge y'all isn't
[1:07:26] that right
[1:07:27] come open if you're right come open this
[1:07:29] blind man's eyes
[1:07:30] but if the lord that i like that it
[1:07:32] wasn't making brethren god
[1:07:35] but the lord jesus christ who i
[1:07:36] represent to you
[1:07:38] that died 2000 years ago and who i show
[1:07:40] and say
[1:07:41] that he is alive and well if he'll come
[1:07:44] open that blind man's eyes how many will
[1:07:46] accept them and all hands went up in
[1:07:48] there right
[1:07:49] and what happened the right thing
[1:07:51] happened they grabbed his clothes
[1:07:54] almost stripped him almost just they
[1:07:55] wanted to touch him
[1:07:57] because those indians they they make
[1:07:59] everybody a god
[1:08:00] so the second he did that the most of
[1:08:02] them probably made him a god i just want
[1:08:04] to touch you know
[1:08:05] they go too far with it but yet he was
[1:08:07] just like peter
[1:08:09] amen wasn't so far off people are people
[1:08:12] just go in the shadow of peter
[1:08:14] and believe hey he they knew he was the
[1:08:15] man of god and believe me but get up and
[1:08:17] walk

[1:08:34] world
[1:08:34] if there's any evil in your heart you
