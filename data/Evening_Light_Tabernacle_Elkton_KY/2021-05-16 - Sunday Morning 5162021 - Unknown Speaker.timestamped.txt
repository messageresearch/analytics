[34:52] today
[34:52] and um before we get into singing i i
[34:56] want to do
[34:56] one thing real quickly and this is just
[34:59] a real real fast thing i just want to
[35:01] mention to you real quickly
[35:02] um i i'm as it stands
[35:05] there's about a 90 chance and i hope
[35:08] this ain't like a weather forecaster you
[35:10] know they always talk about rain or
[35:11] something coming
[35:12] but as it stands i think i'm going to be
[35:14] able to get out of the country and get
[35:16] to the congo in july the brother that
[35:19] i'm working with over there
[35:20] and the pastor that i'm working with in
[35:23] lexington kentucky
[35:25] so far we got all the flights and
[35:26] everything arranged i just have to
[35:28] secure the ticket and
[35:30] we're gone so i i mentioned to you i
[35:32] guess it was last year some of the time
[35:34] about trying to get there we weren't
[35:35] able to make it we had all kinds of
[35:37] hindrances kova didn't hit after that
[35:39] but it looks like because i've had all
[35:41] my shots and all those kind of things
[35:43] like that i got that immunization card
[35:45] i can get in and out without any
[35:47] problems so please please please if you
[35:49] would please pray for me that i can make
[35:51] that thing happen because we've been
[35:53] trying now
[35:54] what um three years i guess we've been
[35:55] talking i've been telling you about it
[35:56] that's my cat about three years i guess
[35:58] trying to get there
[35:59] and i mean to tell you we've had every
[36:02] hindrance in the world trying to get to
[36:04] that place
[36:05] but if you folks will help us pray and
[36:07] uh
[36:08] and trust the lord we'll be able to get
[36:09] there and out safely and all that kind
[36:12] of thing and
[36:12] i don't worry about things like covet
[36:14] and all that i don't worry about stuff
[36:16] like that because
[36:17] believe me when i tell you no matter
[36:18] what you read on the in the
[36:20] paper or here on the news there's a
[36:22] whole lot worse things over in them
[36:23] countries than kovalev
[36:24] and mosquitoes are way more dangerous
[36:26] than cove had ever thought about being
[36:28] and uh so we uh we just trust the lord
[36:31] that god will help us do it
[36:33] and then uh let me mention one more
[36:35] thing to you real quickly
[36:37] and that is that um come
[36:40] as far as i guess maybe like august
[36:43] ish somewhere around there i'm supposed
[36:45] to do a couple virtual conventions with
[36:47] some folks
[36:48] uh down going into mexico
[36:51] central america and into the upper part
[36:54] of
[36:55] south america when i say south america i
[36:56] mean like some of them countries like
[36:58] venezuela guyana
[37:00] uh down through some of the parts of
[37:02] chile and they're supposed to organize
[37:04] this convention to my understanding
[37:06] as a virtual thing in many different
[37:08] churches down through those countries
[37:10] and they're going to connect it
[37:11] through an interlock through an internet
[37:13] streaming service of some sort
[37:15] and they're telling us that it's going
[37:16] to be somewhere around 15 000 people
[37:19] going to be connected on that thing
[37:20] around the world down through like that
[37:21] and they've invited me to be the keynote
[37:23] speaker of that so

[52:16] this morning
[52:17] thank you you musical
[52:20] amen i enjoyed that enjoying all this
[52:23] music
[52:25] and i enjoyed that organ playing i can
[52:26] hear you over there hey man i enjoyed
[52:28] that
[52:28] i'm an organ buff too you know that was
[52:30] my first instrument and i
[52:32] i love it i enjoy it amen good playing
[52:35] everybody
[52:35] matthew five let me begin with verse one
[52:39] and uh pick up one two and three and uh
[52:42] i was with you here the other week and
[52:45] uh thank you sir
[52:47] i started on this about about blessed
[52:50] are they
[52:50] and uh i told the lord now we had
[52:54] actually this weekend arranged before
[52:55] the other wednesday come in
[52:57] and i told the lord i said well you know
[53:00] i hate
[53:01] to as an evangelist try to pick up extra
[53:04] things and tag on you know but
[53:05] i just couldn't get away from this this
[53:07] morning somehow seemed like the lord
[53:08] said just go right back into that and
[53:10] pick up a little bit and i'm going to do
[53:12] my best not to insult nobody this
[53:14] morning okay at least
[53:15] not not that way amen matthew 5
[53:19] verse 1. i want to pick it up on poor in
[53:21] spirit poor in spirit blessed are they
[53:24] but i will use this on the poor in
[53:25] spirit this morning and seeing the
[53:27] multitudes he went up into a mountain
[53:29] when he was set his disciples came to
[53:32] him
[53:33] and he opened his mouth and taught them
[53:35] saying blessed are the poor in spirit
[53:38] for theirs is the kingdom
[53:41] of heaven now let me just read to you
[53:44] the meaning
[53:45] of poor in spirit what it actually means
[53:48] poor in spirit means to be
[53:50] humble humility is the realization
[53:54] that all of your gifts and blessings
[53:57] come from the grace of god to have
[53:59] poverty of spirit means to be completely
[54:02] empty and open to the word of god and
[54:05] when we are an empty cup
[54:06] and devoid of pride we are humble
[54:10] when we are empty cup and devoid of
[54:12] pride we
[54:13] are humble and the meaning of the word
[54:15] poor in the greek means one who has
[54:17] nothing and is completely empty let's
[54:20] pray together over the word
[54:22] lord jesus we so thank you this morning
[54:24] for the opportunity to come together
[54:26] to worship you in spirit and in song
[54:30] and everything that has been
[54:31] accomplished thus far in this service we
[54:34] are eternally grateful to you for those
[54:36] things i pray that you'll come
[54:38] down this morning that you'll take your
[54:39] word and that you'll speak to us
[54:41] law that you'll anoint my mouth to say
[54:43] only that which you'd be pleased with
[54:44] close my mouth to anything lord that i
[54:46] might not maybe
[54:48] should say then lord jesus as we stand
[54:50] here in divine
[54:51] presence father i pray the holy spirit
[54:54] will bless your word today as we receive
[54:56] it
[54:56] in the name of jesus christ and then
[54:59] lord
[54:59] i just want to ask for your favor this
[55:02] morning
[55:02] lord upon all of our believing sons and
[55:05] daughters of god that won't be just
[55:07] maybe here in the service but they might
[55:09] stream the service by the way of the
[55:10] internet
[55:11] lord may you go out through those
[55:12] airwaves and those channels lord and may
[55:14] you bless all that receive it there as
[55:16] well
[55:16] father may the invisible audience be
[55:18] just as edified as the one in the
[55:20] visible
[55:20] and help us now lord to be edified
[55:22] together as we commit ourselves to you
[55:24] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[55:26] amen
[55:27] and amen god bless you this morning you
[55:29] may be seated
[55:31] i want to i want to remember something
[55:33] and try my best not to forget it
[55:35] um uh brother steve laster wrote me
[55:38] and asked if i would have the church
[55:39] pray uh over his
[55:42] knee at some point we'll do that at the
[55:44] end of the service maybe and he just
[55:45] shot me a text this morning and said
[55:48] would you ask him to pray so
[55:49] i i he said it to me i probably said to
[55:52] somebody else too but anyways i told him
[55:53] i'd be happy to do it
[55:54] and then when he heard that i had the
[55:56] service this morning he'd asked if we'd
[55:57] make sure we pray so
[55:59] we'll do that at the end i want to wait
[56:00] till the anointing comes on before we
[56:01] pray for sick and things like that
[56:03] but we we love the lord and appreciate
[56:05] the lord and appreciate god's word don't
[56:07] you appreciate the word
[56:09] and let me tell you something friends
[56:10] the bible is our answer
[56:12] sure is and if we want to know a
[56:14] question or we want to know
[56:16] how to solve anything in our life the
[56:18] bible's got all of the answers that we
[56:19] need
[56:20] to get ourselves in the right condition
[56:22] amen not only to get ready for the
[56:24] rapture
[56:25] but to take care of things on a daily
[56:27] basis every day of our lives
[56:30] we have areas that the holy spirit amen
[56:33] will maybe deal with this on a minor
[56:35] level
[56:35] and then there are major things that god
[56:37] deals with on a major level it don't
[56:39] matter if it's minor
[56:40] middle major the bible has the answer
[56:42] for thing we have need of today
[56:44] and i believe that when the scripture
[56:46] was recorded i believe that it was a
[56:48] man's hand that might have took a pen
[56:50] and wrote it down but the bible said
[56:53] that it was the holy spirit that moved
[56:55] on man to give us the words of the lord
[56:57] that we have right here today and i
[56:59] believe that god has watched over his
[57:01] word
[57:01] and has protected his word and i believe
[57:04] that every
[57:05] word of it is valuable to us for our
[57:07] edification
[57:08] and are getting ready to go home with
[57:10] the lord jesus christ i believe that
[57:12] and i don't believe that the bible says
[57:14] things just in a
[57:16] in a haphazard manner and i don't think
[57:18] that the scripture uses terminologies
[57:20] that
[57:21] are necessarily the same as what we
[57:23] would say
[57:24] and i think sometimes when we read the
[57:26] bible if we're not careful we'll try to
[57:29] think of expressions and think of
[57:31] wordings and what more
[57:33] in the way we say them or the way we
[57:35] express them
[57:36] when bible meanings can be completely
[57:38] different from that
[57:39] and let me give you an example i mean
[57:41] use the word
[57:42] uh mature or perfect which should say
[57:44] the word perfect
[57:45] in our mind perfect means flawless
[57:49] and just without any kind of errors or
[57:51] any kind of mistakes or any of those
[57:53] kind of things
[57:54] but really bible perfection or the
[57:56] meaning of the word perfection in the
[57:58] bible
[57:58] simply means maturity or coming to a
[58:00] place where you understand how to handle
[58:03] all of the imperfections of life and the
[58:05] imperfection of walking
[58:07] so we would use the word perfect we say
[58:09] well that is perfect we think no
[58:10] mistakes no flaws
[58:12] those kind of things but really when
[58:14] you're looking at it scripturally
[58:15] speaking
[58:16] perfect in that manner is not the same
[58:18] and perfect in the bible way of it
[58:21] now the same meaning goes to the word
[58:23] poor when we think of the word poor
[58:25] in our mind we might consider that poor
[58:28] might mean without money
[58:29] uh being destitute not even being able
[58:31] to har
[58:32] together two nicholas's express goes to
[58:34] be able to buy a hamburger
[58:36] or a coke or a pepsi cold as my mom
[58:38] always said
[58:39] and those kind of things is our idea of
[58:42] what
[58:42] poor means but when you're speaking of
[58:44] poor in terms of
[58:46] jesus saying blessed are the poor in
[58:49] spirit
[58:49] he's not referring to wealth he's not
[58:51] referring to someone's economic
[58:53] status meaning what kind of a class they
[58:56] fit into whether they're lower or
[58:57] poor middle class of some sort but poor
[59:00] in spirit
[59:00] holds a different expression or a
[59:02] different meaning biblically
[59:04] than what it does for us here in ladies
[59:06] in our meaning and our understanding of
[59:08] poor
[59:09] we would think of somebody that didn't
[59:10] hardly have nothing couldn't pay their
[59:11] light bill
[59:12] those kind of things but poor according
[59:14] to the scripture as jesus used it here
[59:17] the very word that jesus used simply
[59:19] means
[59:20] to be empty and and and to be a vessel
[59:24] that has been
[59:24] emptied out now i want you to listen to
[59:27] this what brother brahman says in
[59:28] perfect strength by perfect weakness and
[59:29] i quoted this to you a couple weeks ago
[59:31] but
[59:31] let me refresh your mind if you don't
[59:33] mind when brethren says here that god's
[59:35] strategy
[59:36] is to take empty human vessels and
[59:39] shake the world with them he said now
[59:41] just a little bit we'll go he said but
[59:43] like pentecost at pentecost
[59:45] he said what did he do he said it took
[59:47] him 10 days to get them all emptied up
[59:50] but they were all standing there with
[59:51] their vessels turned up
[59:53] and god took himself and filled them up
[59:56] he said that's all they shook the world
[59:58] he poured
[59:59] himself into them he
[1:00:02] poured himself into them he said that's
[1:00:06] the need
[1:00:07] of today notice that that's what we need
[1:00:09] today
[1:00:10] is empty vessels sir so god can
[1:00:14] fill them up he said i've got to bypass
[1:00:16] a lot here
[1:00:17] god cannot use them as long as they're
[1:00:19] already filled up
[1:00:20] if they're full of theological training
[1:00:22] god can't use you
[1:00:24] god's got to have an empty vessel so
[1:00:26] that he
[1:00:27] can fill them so god then had a strategy
[1:00:31] in taking a man or a woman and emptying
[1:00:33] them so completely
[1:00:35] that he could fill that vessel with
[1:00:37] himself
[1:00:38] now i want you to look at the very
[1:00:39] terminology that that
[1:00:41] joel was led to use remember what i said
[1:00:44] the bible
[1:00:45] doesn't just say things for the sake of
[1:00:46] saying it but look at the very
[1:00:48] terminology
[1:00:49] that joel used whenever he began his
[1:00:52] prophecy
[1:00:52] that he said in the last days i god
[1:00:56] will pour out of my spirit upon all
[1:00:59] flesh
[1:00:59] and here jesus and all of the types in
[1:01:02] the bible
[1:01:02] are leading up to god is looking for
[1:01:05] earthen vessels
[1:01:06] that he can fill with baptism of the
[1:01:08] holy ghost i mean even look at that word
[1:01:10] fill with the holy ghost if we are going
[1:01:12] to be
[1:01:13] filled with the holy ghost then we must
[1:01:15] be an
[1:01:16] empty vessel that the holy spirit
[1:01:20] now amen can be filled up with the holy
[1:01:23] ghost if you
[1:01:24] are a full vessel full of the things of
[1:01:26] the world full of your ideas full of
[1:01:27] attitudes full of creeds full of this
[1:01:29] that and the other
[1:01:30] the holy spirit has no inlet into your
[1:01:32] heart that's why it is extremely and i
[1:01:35] mean
[1:01:36] vitally important for you and i to spend
[1:01:39] our days
[1:01:40] the day that we are not filling up it
[1:01:42] should be days spent emptying out
[1:01:45] you see a christian has an in-goal and
[1:01:47] an outgo and two of the most
[1:01:48] important jobs a christian has in this
[1:01:50] world is to spend
[1:01:52] all the time emptying out from
[1:01:54] everything contrary to the word
[1:01:56] and then spending the rest of that time
[1:01:59] i basically just summed up 2 000 years
[1:02:01] of christian history in a few phrases
[1:02:03] amen and really at the end of the day
[1:02:05] that's pretty much what it boils down to
[1:02:07] and you realize a person that has their
[1:02:09] own ideas their own
[1:02:10] fear about things they have their own
[1:02:12] ideas about maybe the word of god or
[1:02:14] their own ideas
[1:02:15] about family their own ideas about
[1:02:17] church even
[1:02:18] do you understand that a pastor has an
[1:02:21] important job because he has people
[1:02:23] that comes into a sanctuary and they sit
[1:02:25] there with him two three times a week
[1:02:27] every how long they might meet
[1:02:28] this role his main role in
[1:02:30] responsibility
[1:02:31] is to go in there and preach to the
[1:02:33] people in a manner
[1:02:34] that he can empty them out and then turn
[1:02:36] around and preach in a way he can fill
[1:02:38] them up
[1:02:39] and you want to talk about a hard job it
[1:02:41] takes a man
[1:02:42] special built and called of god to put
[1:02:44] up with a bunch of stubborn hard-headed
[1:02:46] egotistical mean
[1:02:48] rude and arrogant people i know i
[1:02:51] preach that none of y'all here but i'm
[1:02:53] just talking about in general that don't
[1:02:55] want to be emptied out and almost get
[1:02:56] offended at you
[1:02:58] and not almost they do get offended at
[1:03:00] you if you dare to
[1:03:02] ask them to be different because people
[1:03:05] come with their own preconceived ideas
[1:03:07] come on you can say amen
[1:03:08] they come with their own thoughts of how
[1:03:10] they believe that the world should run
[1:03:12] and their own thoughts i believe
[1:03:13] christianity
[1:03:14] what it looks like and all that and it
[1:03:16] becomes the minister's lot
[1:03:18] to try to convince them that what
[1:03:20] they're thinking is wrong
[1:03:21] how do they do that the first thing
[1:03:23] you've got to do is you've got to get
[1:03:25] that individual convinced that they need
[1:03:27] to let go of the way they think
[1:03:29] sometimes a pastor or a preacher in
[1:03:31] general but especially pastors
[1:03:32] has to come into a congregation and just
[1:03:34] swing into that bunch with everything
[1:03:36] he's got
[1:03:37] because he's got to be hard enough and
[1:03:40] rude enough sometimes
[1:03:41] to shake folks lose from things that
[1:03:43] they hold on to because let's face facts
[1:03:46] we don't let go of our thoughts very
[1:03:47] easily what we
[1:03:49] we take comfort in and what we think is
[1:03:52] our norm
[1:03:52] and our status quo and how we live our
[1:03:55] life we don't want to let that go
[1:03:56] and especially we don't want the holy
[1:03:58] spirit to come in and start rattling us
[1:04:00] unraveling our cage
[1:04:02] and trying to make us different from
[1:04:03] what we have always known
[1:04:05] but brother sister listen to me in 2000
[1:04:08] years of the church going even back into
[1:04:09] the old testament
[1:04:11] god has never dealt with a group of
[1:04:13] people but what first he didn't shake
[1:04:15] them to their very core
[1:04:17] and shake their ideas and shake their
[1:04:19] thoughts and turn upside down
[1:04:21] every belief they've ever had in
[1:04:23] everything they've ever
[1:04:24] been taught remember what brother brown
[1:04:27] even said about isaiah that it leaned so
[1:04:29] heavily
[1:04:30] on the arm of uzziah that whenever god
[1:04:33] took uzziah away amen isaiah was so
[1:04:36] distraught he didn't know what to do
[1:04:38] with himself
[1:04:40] this is the whole reason he went into
[1:04:42] the temple to pray in the first place
[1:04:44] because he was seeking god what do i do
[1:04:46] now this was my mentor
[1:04:48] this was the man i followed and there
[1:04:50] he's laying dead
[1:04:52] what do i do now you see god has a way
[1:04:54] of shaking a man that he wants to use or
[1:04:57] a woman that he wants to put in his head
[1:04:59] from every influence that'll dissuade
[1:05:01] him
[1:05:02] and hear isaiah and the temple sing the
[1:05:04] very holy spirit the angels of the lord
[1:05:05] and things
[1:05:06] around and look at this man he's in such
[1:05:09] a state of mind
[1:05:10] that when the holy ghost visits him
[1:05:12] right there in that vision when he's
[1:05:13] looking at them angels of the lord
[1:05:15] he said i am a man of unclean lips
[1:05:18] i wonder if isaiah would have been a
[1:05:20] little bit different before uzziah went
[1:05:23] maybe he would have had a little bit
[1:05:24] more idea maybe he was one of the elite
[1:05:27] of the message of that day you know we
[1:05:29] get that mentality too that we are the
[1:05:30] elite of the world
[1:05:32] and we don't need to be shook and we
[1:05:34] don't need to be dealt with them we
[1:05:35] don't need to be
[1:05:36] preached to get a lot of eye blinks but
[1:05:38] not enough amens
[1:05:40] come on now and you realize this is the
[1:05:42] reason why the holy ghost sometimes
[1:05:45] rattle our cages and shake us loose from
[1:05:48] everything this is one reason diseases
[1:05:50] come
[1:05:50] do you realize that when you're praying
[1:05:52] for somebody you need to be very careful
[1:05:54] about using your holy ghost or a gift of
[1:05:57] the lord to call that demon off that
[1:05:59] person's life
[1:06:00] you don't know but what the holy ghost
[1:06:01] didn't place it there because they've
[1:06:03] been disobedient and haven't been
[1:06:05] listening
[1:06:07] and demonology the prophet taught us
[1:06:09] that god will use it as a whip
[1:06:11] if you've been disobedient god will use
[1:06:13] sickness as a whip
[1:06:15] to rattle you shake you get you woke up
[1:06:18] to pay attention
[1:06:20] about who's really in charge amen
[1:06:23] remember what he said about look up your
[1:06:24] redemption draw now that can be done on
[1:06:26] your back the same as
[1:06:27] your feet god knows how to put you in a
[1:06:31] position where you'll look up
[1:06:33] well you'll focus on what needs to be
[1:06:35] focused on
[1:06:36] especially if you're his child hey don't
[1:06:39] kid yourself if you're his boy or his
[1:06:41] girl
[1:06:42] he will turn your world upside down if
[1:06:44] that means getting you empty
[1:06:47] and believe me when i tell you friends
[1:06:49] our biggest problem around the ranks of
[1:06:51] this mess is the greatest problem we've
[1:06:53] got
[1:06:53] we've got too many folks that are full
[1:06:56] they're too filled up on this to fill up
[1:06:59] on that you might as well say man
[1:07:01] they're filled up on all kinds of things
[1:07:03] that's why the word has no place
[1:07:05] in them because they're so full of
[1:07:07] everything they've heard
[1:07:08] all the things that can be possibly said
[1:07:10] and you start preaching on the covenant
[1:07:12] of the lord you preach on the holy ghost
[1:07:13] you preach on it they're sitting in
[1:07:14] their own mind going i know that yeah i
[1:07:16] know that i've heard that for years
[1:07:17] i don't you're too full if you ever
[1:07:20] empty upright
[1:07:21] there's never been a sermon on calvary
[1:07:23] i've ever heard preach that i ever felt
[1:07:25] like i've heard it already
[1:07:27] but you get too full and all of a sudden
[1:07:29] that comes
[1:07:31] oh well i don't mean it's like a person
[1:07:32] that's been starving to death
[1:07:34] you invite them to a seven course
[1:07:35] banquet they sit down and they eat and
[1:07:38] they eat and they eat and they are
[1:07:39] stuffed to their
[1:07:41] y'all say gizzard over here we do in
[1:07:43] tennessee anyways they are so full they
[1:07:45] couldn't eat another bite
[1:07:46] and then you try to offer them a
[1:07:48] beautiful pumpkin pie or a spiced apple
[1:07:50] thing or some kind of a deal like that
[1:07:52] and they don't they don't they're not
[1:07:53] interested in any why they're
[1:07:55] full oh if that is the condition of the
[1:07:58] reason people just sit in church
[1:08:00] and look like a bunch of monkeys looking
[1:08:02] at a banana
[1:08:04] they are so full they don't have any
[1:08:06] enthusiasm they're so full of things
[1:08:08] this is what jesus said blessed are they
[1:08:11] that hunger
[1:08:12] and thirst after righteousness for they
[1:08:14] shall be filled
[1:08:16] you cannot be hungry if you're too
[1:08:18] filled up on things
[1:08:20] let me give you an example of what that
[1:08:22] looks like you spend your time listening
[1:08:25] at all the problems going around the
[1:08:26] ranks of this message okay
[1:08:28] maybe on the websites or maybe you're
[1:08:30] talking to somebody or some kind of a
[1:08:32] fellowship or something and every time
[1:08:34] you have a discussion
[1:08:35] it's about all the problems you realize
[1:08:37] after a few weeks of that
[1:08:39] you start getting filled up with those
[1:08:41] ideas and those thoughts and then every
[1:08:43] time you go to church or every person
[1:08:44] you talk to
[1:08:45] you start trying to scan and discern i
[1:08:48] wonder if they're like that thing i
[1:08:50] heard the other day i wonder if that
[1:08:52] church is like this one i heard about
[1:08:53] that
[1:08:54] you you see what's happened it's gonna
[1:08:56] be hard for you to have love and to be
[1:08:57] able to cover a multitude of sins
[1:08:59] because you've filled yourself up on a
[1:09:01] bunch of nonsense
[1:09:03] and that's all your mind has entertained
[1:09:05] and your mind is filled up on that
[1:09:07] glory to god well i said i wasn't going
[1:09:11] to insult you but
[1:09:13] maybe i'm there already now you realize
[1:09:16] the holy spirit
[1:09:17] doesn't want us to live our lives in
[1:09:19] such a manner this is the reason why
[1:09:20] that now listen i'm not i'm not silly i
[1:09:23] realize that people are going to have
[1:09:25] the latest of technology people are
[1:09:26] going to have facebook they're going to
[1:09:27] have twitter
[1:09:28] they're going to have instagram they're
[1:09:29] going to communicate through twitch and
[1:09:31] all these other
[1:09:31] i realize that and no matter preachers
[1:09:33] gonna stop us they're not gonna do any
[1:09:35] different
[1:09:35] no matter how many times we tell them
[1:09:37] from the pulpit don't do it
[1:09:38] the first car that comes along with
[1:09:40] bluetooth they're gonna buy it
[1:09:43] come on somebody i realize it i'm not
[1:09:45] silly i'm not one that i think we should
[1:09:47] be living in the prehistoric era
[1:09:49] and walking around with a club in our
[1:09:50] hand you know and stalking like the
[1:09:53] caveman trying to find supper that night
[1:09:56] i realize god has given the first hunter
[1:09:58] in here
[1:09:59] that tells me that facebook is of the
[1:10:01] devil and i look at your lately davis
[1:10:03] rifle
[1:10:04] you need to check your spirit because if
[1:10:07] you've got laser sights and all those
[1:10:09] uppity do things you've got all the same
[1:10:10] kind of technology that facebook has got
[1:10:14] so if you're going to be against
[1:10:15] technology be against all of it not just
[1:10:16] parts that you don't like
[1:10:18] where'd that come from well come on
[1:10:21] somebody
[1:10:22] but you see the mentality of the world
[1:10:24] is we we got to have this and we got to
[1:10:26] have that we're going to connect to that
[1:10:28] and then get connected there we're going
[1:10:29] to network here yes that's fine if
[1:10:31] you'll not get filled up on it
[1:10:36] but people will sometimes spend hours
[1:10:40] what they call trolling now we used to
[1:10:43] call it scrolling
[1:10:45] now they call it trolling and just going
[1:10:48] through one thing on facebook or twitter
[1:10:50] or instagram
[1:10:51] just one thing after another after
[1:10:53] another after another do you realize if
[1:10:55] people would have
[1:10:56] simply shut the news off and shut their
[1:10:59] phones off
[1:10:59] and never done anything during the
[1:11:01] pandemic but read their bible do you
[1:11:03] realize this nation we'd be ready for
[1:11:04] the coming of the lord right now
[1:11:07] because as much fear was invested into
[1:11:09] the people
[1:11:10] the reason you could not communicate to
[1:11:12] them that there was a way out of this
[1:11:14] mess
[1:11:15] and yet here we are now with the cdc
[1:11:17] releasing two days ago that if you're
[1:11:19] fully vaccinated you no longer have to
[1:11:20] wear a mask
[1:11:23] you can re-enter life and go to church
[1:11:25] and start fellowshiping with your family
[1:11:26] i'm so glad they told me
[1:11:32] ah but you see this is the idea
[1:11:36] is so much people are so filled up
[1:11:39] on so many things violence this is the
[1:11:42] reason why
[1:11:42] that we would preach against video games
[1:11:44] not that the video game itself is wrong
[1:11:47] but you take some child sitting there
[1:11:48] shooting a gun and shooting aliens and
[1:11:50] shooting zombies and
[1:11:51] all these other kind of things they
[1:11:52] spend hours doing it
[1:11:55] they're filling themselves up on the
[1:11:57] idea of what it's like to kill
[1:12:02] like a young person playing super mario
[1:12:04] brothers like i was when i was a kid i'm
[1:12:06] not throwing you in hell
[1:12:07] over donkey kong but some of the trash
[1:12:10] they got out there today is called a
[1:12:12] video game
[1:12:13] you spend hours trying to kill a zombie
[1:12:15] or kill a monster
[1:12:16] or some kind of effect that don't
[1:12:18] understand what you're doing to your
[1:12:19] spirit
[1:12:21] you're filling it up with all kinds of
[1:12:23] things and then when you come to church
[1:12:25] you don't have any more room and then
[1:12:28] you wonder why preachers part on you
[1:12:30] it's easy i see you come to church to
[1:12:33] the eyes of the holy spirit
[1:12:34] that there's not one more place in your
[1:12:36] baggage car to put another box in there
[1:12:39] and so what do i do by the discernment
[1:12:40] of the holy ghost i may not even realize
[1:12:42] i'm doing it but by the word
[1:12:44] i go in there and throw up on the door
[1:12:46] and i start throwing stuff out and
[1:12:47] kicking boxes over and
[1:12:50] and then you leave church called he
[1:12:52] looked right at me when he said that
[1:12:55] don't you blame the preacher's own fault
[1:12:57] that you got filled up on trash
[1:13:01] praise the lord cause that's what the
[1:13:03] bible said
[1:13:04] if he is a minister to your good and
[1:13:06] your works are good
[1:13:08] he will preach good to you but if your
[1:13:11] works are
[1:13:11] evil he said be afraid be very afraid
[1:13:16] for he beareth not the sword in
[1:13:18] vain
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:21] so if you want a preacher to preach in
[1:13:23] the high realm of god up here where
[1:13:24] angels are floating you better live
[1:13:26] there i'll tell you
[1:13:28] because if not he'll get in the gutter
[1:13:30] with you
[1:13:31] because any preacher ain't afraid to get
[1:13:33] in the muck if that's where you are
[1:13:35] to try to preach the truth to you and
[1:13:36] tell you how to get out of that mess
[1:13:38] thank god for men like that i said thank
[1:13:41] god for men that aren't afraid to get
[1:13:42] their hands dirty
[1:13:44] that's that's that's if i had one
[1:13:46] criticism of ministers in this 21st
[1:13:47] century
[1:13:48] it seems to be the preachers are scared
[1:13:50] to death to get their hands dirty now
[1:13:52] it affects their paycheck they go get a
[1:13:54] job then if that's all this matters to
[1:13:55] you
[1:13:56] if all this all this preaching thing is
[1:13:58] to some guys it's just a matter
[1:14:00] of an income or retirement then
[1:14:01] mcdonald's is higher and so is taco bell
[1:14:04] pizza hut i saw walmart's got to open it
[1:14:06] for greeters down in manchester if you
[1:14:07] need one
[1:14:09] preaching ain't got nothing to do with
[1:14:11] what you make or how much money you make
[1:14:14] the holy ghost leads us to get our hands
[1:14:15] dirty to deal with the people whether
[1:14:17] they cut us off hate us dislike us or
[1:14:19] whatever they might do
[1:14:21] and any man of god is worth his weight
[1:14:22] and salt he will preach whether it
[1:14:24] offends people or whether it don't
[1:14:25] offend him come on somebody preached to
[1:14:26] me tonight
[1:14:28] yes sir he's not afraid he bears the
[1:14:30] sword not in vain he bears that word
[1:14:32] because if a soldier of the lord
[1:14:34] comes into these into these ranks and he
[1:14:36] sees the holy spirit sees
[1:14:37] that they're filled up on all kinds of
[1:14:39] things
[1:14:40] why do you think the prophet of god said
[1:14:42] kick out your newspaper to apply the
[1:14:44] token
[1:14:46] now let's be honest you're looking at me
[1:14:48] i'm looking at you
[1:14:49] i don't kick out newspapers i don't
[1:14:51] bring them any
[1:14:54] but if i'm sitting at a coffee shop and
[1:14:55] i'm reading a newspaper i don't feel
[1:14:57] like i've lost the token
[1:15:00] but the point that brother branham was
[1:15:01] making to us even when it comes down to
[1:15:03] something as simple
[1:15:04] as television was that
[1:15:08] people will allow themselves to fill up
[1:15:10] on that
[1:15:12] and they have no room for the holy
[1:15:13] spirit don't forget the very same
[1:15:14] prophet of god we like to throw them
[1:15:16] quotes around about television was a
[1:15:17] television walter himself
[1:15:22] don't think that's the sound of the pen
[1:15:24] dropping
[1:15:26] sure go back and listen to some of these
[1:15:28] things brother bam talks about when he
[1:15:29] said he'd be in a motel room and he hear
[1:15:31] oral roberts was preaching and he'd
[1:15:32] catch the telecast
[1:15:35] or the times he would sit down and watch
[1:15:37] gunsmoke and bonanza from time to time
[1:15:39] well nobody quotes them quotes do they
[1:15:42] you know why i couldn't above our
[1:15:43] legalist
[1:15:43] idea because we that stuff is holiness
[1:15:46] that ain't got nothing to do with
[1:15:47] holiness
[1:15:48] amen some of you that have the amish and
[1:15:50] the men like background you can know you
[1:15:51] can live ever so holy make your own
[1:15:52] clothes and grow your own
[1:15:54] foods and everything else and be just as
[1:15:55] dirty as the devil is
[1:15:57] the blood of christ is what makes us
[1:15:59] clean i feel like preaching this morning
[1:16:02] and not all works that makes us that way
[1:16:04] and also not the
[1:16:05] idea of oh if you see people sitting in
[1:16:08] a restaurant
[1:16:09] a television in the corner and you'll
[1:16:10] see brothers and sisters
[1:16:13] they'll cut them eyes and then we won't
[1:16:16] feel so condemned over such things that
[1:16:18] is a normal natural thing
[1:16:21] it is a normal thing if i'm sitting in a
[1:16:22] mall and i see the same thing on the
[1:16:24] mall that i see on television
[1:16:26] i probably cut my eyes over what in the
[1:16:27] world's going on
[1:16:29] that's human curiosity but the thing
[1:16:32] that sends people to hell is when they
[1:16:33] drag it into the house and they sit for
[1:16:35] hours
[1:16:36] doing nothing but streaming their
[1:16:37] netflix and their prime and their
[1:16:39] and their should have got a bigger amen
[1:16:43] than that
[1:16:45] they're filled up they're getting so
[1:16:49] filled up they have no time for the word
[1:16:50] of god
[1:16:52] they're getting so filled up ain't got
[1:16:53] time for nothing the bible or nothing
[1:16:56] and then they get so filled up on things
[1:16:58] and get so filled up on entertainment
[1:17:00] that when it comes time for church then
[1:17:02] because they've seen so much
[1:17:03] entertainment on their
[1:17:04] youtube and they've seen so much
[1:17:05] entertainment on other streaming
[1:17:07] services and other
[1:17:08] things like that that when they come to
[1:17:10] church the preacher's just not
[1:17:11] entertaining enough
[1:17:16] i see already i'm gonna have to preach
[1:17:17] without you if you don't get with me i'm
[1:17:19] coming on anyways
[1:17:22] huh this is the reason why it's so
[1:17:25] dangerous
[1:17:27] to allow yourself to get into habitual
[1:17:29] things
[1:17:30] of an everyday pattern watching this and
[1:17:32] then watching that
[1:17:33] and then you'll add 12 and then you'll
[1:17:34] add 14 and then before you know it
[1:17:36] you're binging when's the last time we
[1:17:39] finished the word of god i want to ask
[1:17:40] you a question
[1:17:42] evening light listen to brother ben when
[1:17:44] is the last time any of you binged your
[1:17:46] bible
[1:17:48] when's the last time any of you binged
[1:17:50] on the holy spirit in prayer
[1:17:52] when's the last time some of you binge
[1:17:56] on listening to tapes and listen to the
[1:17:58] prophet's voice
[1:17:59] but we're so easy to bend some new
[1:18:01] series or some new television show
[1:18:04] but when it comes to the holy ghost
[1:18:05] we're not interested in binging on that
[1:18:08] god let me become an alcoholic a
[1:18:11] spiritual one
[1:18:13] let me get so addicted to jesus christ
[1:18:15] and his word amen that is all that's on
[1:18:17] my mind day and night
[1:18:21] but empty that is the poor in spirit
[1:18:24] jesus referred to
[1:18:25] is those that are empty
[1:18:28] all right listen to this again in
[1:18:30] investments brother man said jesus said
[1:18:32] in matthew 5
[1:18:33] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[1:18:34] theirs is the kingdom of heaven we don't
[1:18:36] want to take that place he says
[1:18:39] that rattled place that
[1:18:42] way a place of being poor that away
[1:18:46] place of being poor in spirit that
[1:18:47] rutted place he called it
[1:18:48] we don't want that we want somebody to
[1:18:50] praise us and be a big somebody
[1:18:55] we don't want the rut
[1:18:59] we're interested in being
[1:19:02] noticed and if any of you sit right here
[1:19:05] this morning and try to pretend to me
[1:19:07] like you don't want to be noticed i'm
[1:19:08] calling your bluff and calling you a
[1:19:09] liar right now
[1:19:11] because i'm telling you the same as i'm
[1:19:13] telling myself
[1:19:14] all of us want attention all of us want
[1:19:16] to be noticed
[1:19:17] and all of us want somebody to love us
[1:19:19] and notice that we're on this earth
[1:19:22] and feel like we've made a difference in
[1:19:23] their lives come on preach to me
[1:19:27] so let's not start this whole idea or
[1:19:29] that holy message elite attitude
[1:19:32] not me i don't i don't need such things
[1:19:36] as that
[1:19:37] just be honest in the house of the lord
[1:19:38] because god knows you're lying anyways
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:43] [Applause]
[1:19:46] we want somebody to love on us somebody
[1:19:49] to notice our efforts but listen
[1:19:52] if we are going to be the right kind of
[1:19:54] children of god and i'm not putting you
[1:19:56] down
[1:19:56] or making fun of you when i make that
[1:19:58] remark that i'm saying we are all in the
[1:20:00] same boat that's my point
[1:20:02] and if i took this congregation out of
[1:20:04] here and took another one in from
[1:20:05] arkansas
[1:20:06] put them out and put another one in here
[1:20:07] from missouri
[1:20:09] every person we had preached to brother
[1:20:11] tom would be saying the same thing
[1:20:12] we all want to be paid attention to
[1:20:16] there's something in human nature
[1:20:19] that craves for somebody just to notice
[1:20:22] us
[1:20:23] and don't sit and think that that always
[1:20:25] means the main spotlight
[1:20:28] sometimes it's minor things for example
[1:20:31] you take somebody that's introverted in
[1:20:33] their nature you know what i mean by
[1:20:34] introverted they're kind of an
[1:20:35] internal you know everything's on the
[1:20:37] inside my oldest daughter's that way
[1:20:39] she's
[1:20:40] like my dad a spitting image of my dad i
[1:20:42] told her the other day i said my dad
[1:20:44] will
[1:20:44] never die as long as you're a sucking
[1:20:45] wind
[1:20:48] she's a spitting image of the man she's
[1:20:51] sick in her body
[1:20:53] when she started going through all those
[1:20:54] problems with her gallbladder and she
[1:20:55] was so sick and had that pancreatitis
[1:20:57] hit her and she was hurting so badly
[1:20:59] if the kid made a whimper i'd have been
[1:21:01] surprised
[1:21:02] she was hurting so bad so miserable
[1:21:05] and i'd say how you doing and just like
[1:21:07] my dad four days before he went to his
[1:21:09] grave
[1:21:10] i asked my dad how you doing yeah all
[1:21:12] right
[1:21:14] no you're not you're not all right
[1:21:17] you're dying but that introverted nature
[1:21:22] ah they go speak out but that doesn't
[1:21:26] make them different
[1:21:27] because they don't always get in your
[1:21:29] face and crave the attention
[1:21:32] sometimes those are the very people that
[1:21:33] are just begging for somebody to just
[1:21:36] ask them how they're feeling
[1:21:41] you know the extroverted type people
[1:21:42] those are the ones that get all the
[1:21:43] attention of course because
[1:21:44] all squeaky wheels get oil
[1:21:48] or at least that's expression anyway you
[1:21:51] have this
[1:21:52] population of people that are absolutely
[1:21:55] they they
[1:21:56] they're inside their whole world there's
[1:21:58] an empire of stuff
[1:22:00] a metropolis of stuff going on on the
[1:22:02] inside but you never know it
[1:22:04] but they're built just the same as you
[1:22:06] are why do you think some of these very
[1:22:08] people were referring to are the very
[1:22:10] ones
[1:22:11] that end up committing suicide doing
[1:22:13] heinous acts and crime and all kinds of
[1:22:15] things
[1:22:15] and then some guy come on the television
[1:22:17] or someone on a news broadcast or
[1:22:19] you'll catch it on a we never even
[1:22:21] dreamed that this guy would be like this
[1:22:23] yeah that's right but you see inside all
[1:22:26] of us
[1:22:27] we lack that something that was passed
[1:22:30] to us from the fall
[1:22:32] we lack that something that makes us
[1:22:34] crave
[1:22:35] after somebody's attention don't you
[1:22:38] recognize where that come from that is
[1:22:42] man being separated from god
[1:22:44] and what he really wants is god's
[1:22:46] attention
[1:22:49] hallelujah and so because we're the type
[1:22:52] of people humanity i mean
[1:22:54] that we kind of look for attention in
[1:22:56] some way if god would only show himself
[1:22:58] with skin on it how many times have you
[1:23:01] prayed
[1:23:01] that the lord would do some fantastic
[1:23:03] thing in front of your eyes
[1:23:04] just so he would pay attention to you
[1:23:16] and yet the very thing that we can do to
[1:23:18] get his attention is the very thing we
[1:23:19] don't do
[1:23:21] and that's get completely empty
[1:23:24] so he can fill us i've said this for the
[1:23:28] last few months
[1:23:29] holy spirit give me something i've been
[1:23:30] sharing with people all around the
[1:23:31] country thus far
[1:23:33] i want to share with you this morning
[1:23:34] it's this very simple thing
[1:23:36] sometimes people get it in their mind
[1:23:39] that in order to be right with god
[1:23:41] his attention i mean that they've got to
[1:23:43] be sinful they got to live like the
[1:23:44] devil they got to do all kinds of
[1:23:46] meanness and
[1:23:46] horrible this that and the other in
[1:23:48] order to get god's attention so he'll
[1:23:49] really come down on him to show his love
[1:23:52] but do you realize brother brown
[1:23:54] preaches one message one time he says
[1:23:55] this
[1:23:56] he cares do you care you know what he
[1:23:58] said in that message if you want to get
[1:23:59] god's attention
[1:24:01] just simply show the lord you care
[1:24:06] showing that you are concerned about his
[1:24:08] word showing that you are concerned
[1:24:10] about the truth come on somebody
[1:24:12] huh somebody help me showing that you're
[1:24:15] interested in the people of god
[1:24:18] that you're interested in the holy
[1:24:19] spirit and the more interest you show
[1:24:21] the more interest he'll show
[1:24:25] we don't have to live like the devil to
[1:24:27] get his attention
[1:24:29] the fact of the reason that many of us
[1:24:31] never overcome certain battles in our
[1:24:33] life if we'll be honest about it is
[1:24:34] because we really
[1:24:36] are so stubborn we just don't want to
[1:24:37] let go of things
[1:24:40] listen i'm battling things right now i
[1:24:42] battle my weight
[1:24:44] i battle a lot of that if i'm really
[1:24:45] being honest about my weight
[1:24:47] if i'm being honest about my present
[1:24:50] health
[1:24:50] i just think been serious enough about
[1:24:52] this old heart of mine
[1:24:54] or these kidneys or that pancreas i've
[1:24:57] been serious enough about these things
[1:24:59] i've taken it just a little bit easy
[1:25:00] because why just like everybody else
[1:25:02] we settle into this little rut
[1:25:08] and our run is a whole lot different
[1:25:09] than his rut
[1:25:11] because brother and said we don't want
[1:25:12] to take the rutted place well that pla
[1:25:14] that rut is a whole lot deeper than the
[1:25:15] rut we're in
[1:25:18] this is completely empty in spirit
[1:25:21] notice again
[1:25:22] he says i love this he said you know we
[1:25:24] don't have to be so poor
[1:25:26] in money we have to get poor in spirit
[1:25:31] so for you that might be thinking that
[1:25:32] this just simply means not having any
[1:25:34] money
[1:25:34] remember being rich is not a sin
[1:25:41] i understand why many of you ain't
[1:25:42] holiday man because you're in the same
[1:25:45] place i'm in
[1:25:47] silver and gold have i none
[1:25:51] [Laughter]
[1:25:53] right
[1:25:57] but being poor in spirit doesn't mean
[1:25:59] you have come empty
[1:26:01] meaning that you don't place your own
[1:26:03] thoughts in the way of the holy ghost
[1:26:07] you realize even some of you businessmen
[1:26:08] in here don't run your business by what
[1:26:10] you think
[1:26:11] run your business according to your
[1:26:13] leadership of the holy spirit if the
[1:26:14] holy ghost tells you don't take that
[1:26:16] deal then you better not use your brain
[1:26:17] to take it
[1:26:19] if the holy ghost tells you not to buy a
[1:26:21] house or not to buy a car or not to do
[1:26:23] this you know that thing you better obey
[1:26:24] them things
[1:26:26] let's go and see way on down the road
[1:26:28] you're only looking at present tense he
[1:26:30] sees past present and future
[1:26:33] he knows where a lot of those business
[1:26:34] deals were conceived at
[1:26:36] what their background and foundation is
[1:26:40] and then when they present it to you it
[1:26:42] may look so good you think
[1:26:43] man you'd be stupid to pass this up
[1:26:46] but god knows where it was born
[1:26:50] that's the reason god told him to go
[1:26:51] into ai and tell everything including
[1:26:53] the babies too
[1:26:55] because god knew the background of those
[1:26:56] children would come right up underneath
[1:26:58] that heathen regime
[1:26:59] and they would come right up to hate
[1:27:01] israel and destroy liver the same
[1:27:02] later and they'd end up going by the
[1:27:04] sport anyways
[1:27:07] because god intended to wipe them all
[1:27:08] off the face of the earth
[1:27:11] did you tell me he didn't the holy ghost
[1:27:14] got very very very
[1:27:16] very disturbed at saul when saul went
[1:27:20] down there and spared king ag
[1:27:23] god wanted to wipe the whole bunch out
[1:27:27] so he knew there he knew their past and
[1:27:28] he knows their future and he knows what
[1:27:30] they're all about
[1:27:31] so before i make any kind of a decision
[1:27:34] before i do anything at all i wait for
[1:27:36] that little voice to speak to me
[1:27:39] yeah this is the way that's right
[1:27:43] you know when i first started preaching
[1:27:45] full time
[1:27:46] may i just a moment when i started
[1:27:49] preaching full-time
[1:27:51] when i moved to tennessee the holy ghost
[1:27:53] told me to come to tennessee i said okay
[1:27:56] finally i struggled kicked far you've
[1:27:58] heard my testimony on this before
[1:27:59] i told the lord but listen when the lord
[1:28:02] started opening doors for me to preach
[1:28:05] i was i marveled at the preachers that
[1:28:08] would tell me
[1:28:09] don't preach for that one don't preach
[1:28:10] for that one don't preach for that one
[1:28:11] don't go down there
[1:28:12] don't you'll ruin your ministry do you
[1:28:15] know that during a global pandemic
[1:28:17] when the majority of evangelists were
[1:28:19] having to go get jobs because the
[1:28:21] food on the table do you know i
[1:28:23] continued preaching three
[1:28:24] times every weekend and do you know that
[1:28:27] i could have been
[1:28:28] preaching every single weekend do you
[1:28:30] know why not because i'm big shot i'm a
[1:28:32] bragger
[1:28:33] because i took all them little churches
[1:28:34] and preachers told me not to
[1:28:41] i was in them places that were socially
[1:28:43] distanced way before they had
[1:28:44] associations
[1:28:47] [Laughter]
[1:28:51] the point i'm trying to make to you is
[1:28:53] that if we follow the holy ghost god
[1:28:54] knows the ends and the outs of every bit
[1:28:56] of it
[1:28:58] if he knows that wouldn't he know
[1:28:59] marriage let me understand who you're
[1:29:01] supposed to marry who you're not
[1:29:02] supposed to marry
[1:29:04] oh you said what's that got to do with
[1:29:05] anything same reason brother brandon
[1:29:06] said before you marry a boy or a girl
[1:29:08] you better check their family check
[1:29:10] their background
[1:29:11] she may be pretty now but look at mama
[1:29:16] look at daddy those jeans don't fall far
[1:29:20] from the tree
[1:29:25] amen and if mama ain't
[1:29:28] one of these type of women their feet is
[1:29:29] never a boat in her house
[1:29:31] and she don't her children don't raise
[1:29:33] up early to praise her i don't care what
[1:29:35] she may look like you better be careful
[1:29:36] boy
[1:29:41] or a girl on the other side for that
[1:29:43] matter let's take the other side too
[1:29:45] he might be at work he might have all
[1:29:47] kinds of money i've had sisters come to
[1:29:49] me
[1:29:50] i need to marry this man he's got a
[1:29:51] house he's got a job
[1:29:53] he's got a business he's successful yes
[1:29:55] and you know what ended up happening
[1:29:57] because they didn't obey the holy spirit
[1:29:59] they married a workaholic
[1:30:02] and then they were set at home like a
[1:30:03] slave
[1:30:05] with no affection no attention no love
[1:30:09] just some man would come home and put a
[1:30:10] put a big paycheck in the bank
[1:30:12] just to turn around go to his office and
[1:30:14] get right back on the phone
[1:30:16] not a family man a workaholic you know
[1:30:18] there's as many workaholics in this
[1:30:19] message
[1:30:20] as there used to be alcoholics because
[1:30:23] people have gotten such a trend of
[1:30:24] making big money in big houses and big
[1:30:26] this that the other
[1:30:27] and they have forgotten where our
[1:30:28] background was oh he did not come to
[1:30:30] message a bunch of rich people
[1:30:32] we came humble poured out emptied out so
[1:30:35] the holy spirit could fill us up
[1:30:38] but now we've gotten comfortable
[1:30:42] all right
[1:30:46] again in church age brother and said the
[1:30:48] people of god are not material minded
[1:30:53] anybody want to stop and have an honor
[1:30:55] call to repent a little while
[1:31:01] because look how easy it is to become
[1:31:04] material minded
[1:31:06] i mean brother we're living in a day
[1:31:07] where i mean everything is touch and
[1:31:10] and and wireless and listen
[1:31:13] i come up generation x right i'm a 77
[1:31:15] baby
[1:31:16] all right if you would have told me that
[1:31:19] i can perform 90
[1:31:20] of everything i need to do on this
[1:31:21] little device right here i would have
[1:31:22] thought you were from star trek or some
[1:31:24] kind of a
[1:31:26] star wars or some of the futuristic
[1:31:28] things out in the future somewhere
[1:31:32] i would have carried on beam me up
[1:31:33] scotty
[1:31:34] [Laughter]
[1:31:38] i never dreamed the first cell phone i
[1:31:40] owned i was 18 years old i went into a
[1:31:42] radio shack that is special a bunch of
[1:31:44] pennies on the floor said pick up a
[1:31:45] penny take a phone home
[1:31:46] i did but i didn't realize that phone
[1:31:48] still cost me 985 dollars a month
[1:31:53] and it was as big as this speaker right
[1:31:54] here and i had a trucker's antenna on
[1:31:57] top of that little old chevy
[1:31:59] spectrum of mine 85 chevy spectrum i was
[1:32:02] i was such a big guy even back then not
[1:32:04] fat but big
[1:32:05] and i put that little car on one arm at
[1:32:07] a time
[1:32:09] and i would go through mcdonald's and
[1:32:10] this gigantic antenna sticking right up
[1:32:12] on top of it
[1:32:13] what's that it's my cell phone
[1:32:17] where'd that come from just look in the
[1:32:18] back seat is sitting on the back row
[1:32:26] but why why do we why do we follow such
[1:32:29] what they call
[1:32:30] trends because it's an easy thing for us
[1:32:33] to reach out into this ladies and age to
[1:32:37] try to satisfy what we think will make
[1:32:40] us the most comfortable in life
[1:32:43] yeah and really it's a cultural thing
[1:32:45] more than anything else because i've
[1:32:47] been to those countries and some of you
[1:32:48] have to i'm sure if you've traveled
[1:32:50] but when you go under them places they
[1:32:52] live without even the idea
[1:32:54] of electricity in the home i mean okay
[1:32:57] let me put you this way first time i
[1:32:59] went overseas
[1:33:00] and i asked them where the bathroom was
[1:33:02] and they pointed to that little old shed
[1:33:03] over there in the corner
[1:33:05] i wasn't they didn't that didn't rattle
[1:33:06] me too bad
[1:33:08] simply because my granny was a granny
[1:33:09] you know what i'm talking about
[1:33:11] she was a tennessee granny i understood
[1:33:13] what our house was years ago
[1:33:15] i understood what it meant to live a
[1:33:17] country life years ago i might have been
[1:33:18] born in ohio but believe me there's a
[1:33:20] whole lot more rebel running through
[1:33:22] these veins than ever was buckeye
[1:33:25] as i was raised on grits and maters
[1:33:27] tomatoes
[1:33:28] and
[1:33:33] when i walked out there in that outhouse
[1:33:34] the outhouse didn't bother me
[1:33:38] but when i saw what i had to do in order
[1:33:40] to use the facility
[1:33:42] i said dorothy we are not in kansas
[1:33:48] anymore
[1:33:51] and i'd sit there on that little that
[1:33:52] little plastic chair was with my little
[1:33:54] spot where i supposed to sit where i
[1:33:55] preach
[1:33:56] and i watch people go in and out in and
[1:33:58] out and out
[1:33:59] in and out and it didn't seem like it
[1:34:01] bothered them at all
[1:34:02] now for you and i we would die we'd have
[1:34:06] brad would have to use his medical
[1:34:08] training to come and resuscitate
[1:34:10] us from heart failure
[1:34:16] because we would absolutely just we
[1:34:18] would almost collapse which is the whole
[1:34:20] reason why some preachers don't become
[1:34:21] missionaries anymore
[1:34:23] i heard god tell me one just here about
[1:34:25] three four years ago we were sitting in
[1:34:26] this real fancy place up there
[1:34:27] and he said oh i just couldn't mention
[1:34:29] it like that it's just so hard for me to
[1:34:31] sit on a plane like that for so long i
[1:34:33] thought bless your little heart
[1:34:34] i'll get your bob on your blankie for
[1:34:36] night night time
[1:34:40] we're not willing to sacrifice what it
[1:34:42] takes to be empty
[1:34:43] so god can use us
[1:34:49] oh lord i don't know where all of this
[1:34:51] come from
[1:34:52] rest assured folks this is brand new hot
[1:34:55] off the press so you're getting it
[1:34:56] i'm getting it just first hand the same
[1:34:58] as you're getting it
[1:35:01] right notice this again i love this he
[1:35:04] said they're not material minded they're
[1:35:05] christ-minded
[1:35:07] they do not seek the treasures that are
[1:35:08] below
[1:35:11] they seek those above it's absolutely
[1:35:13] the truth the majority of christians are
[1:35:15] not wealthy
[1:35:16] that should put us in the bible right
[1:35:18] now
[1:35:19] there's any quotes you could say amen to
[1:35:21] that ought to be the one right
[1:35:25] the majority of christians are not
[1:35:27] wealthy listen
[1:35:29] oh i love it he said rather there on the
[1:35:30] poor side it was so in jesus day true in
[1:35:32] paul's day
[1:35:33] and it should be true today
[1:35:37] but it's not too true for the ladies and
[1:35:40] age
[1:35:42] which is one of vast wealth where often
[1:35:44] the criteria
[1:35:45] listen the criteria meaning that in
[1:35:48] order for you to be eligible to be
[1:35:50] spiritual listen that message folks you
[1:35:53] better listen to brother ben real
[1:35:54] carefully on this
[1:35:56] because i've got a warning from the holy
[1:35:57] spirit i'm going to share with you in a
[1:35:58] moment
[1:35:59] the criterion of spirituality is the
[1:36:02] abundance
[1:36:04] of earthly goods if that doesn't speak
[1:36:07] and testify of where we are right now i
[1:36:10] don't know what quote does
[1:36:12] because there are some people in this
[1:36:14] message that don't even think you have a
[1:36:15] spiritual
[1:36:16] pastor if he's not
[1:36:19] if money ain't rolling out of his ears
[1:36:26] some people would never attend camp
[1:36:28] meetings that were not well financed
[1:36:32] and air conditioned or heated depending
[1:36:34] on the time of year
[1:36:38] here i come anyways
[1:36:42] you say what how's that going to benefit
[1:36:44] us here in elkton kentucky oh you think
[1:36:46] the devil needs a passport to get down
[1:36:47] here to you
[1:36:49] you reckon the devil stops at the border
[1:36:51] up here when he comes from tennessee to
[1:36:53] kentucky that he can't affect your mind
[1:36:55] that's the reason i'm preaching this
[1:36:57] folks we have been affected by what we
[1:37:00] believe is spiritual
[1:37:01] based on how wealthy and how what we
[1:37:03] call blessed it is
[1:37:07] some of my bedrock preaching when i
[1:37:09] first started evangelism i went to a
[1:37:11] little place out in the middle of goshen
[1:37:14] georgia and when i got there it was this
[1:37:17] little old country church
[1:37:19] had no air conditioning there was rolls
[1:37:22] in the floor from where the place was
[1:37:23] just about falling down around my ears
[1:37:25] and i got out there to preach and made
[1:37:27] one jump up and down and heard
[1:37:29] and i went to the other side of the
[1:37:32] platform
[1:37:34] and while i was preaching a dog come
[1:37:36] right in the middle of the
[1:37:38] aisle and sat right down there in that
[1:37:40] aisle and listen to me preach he was
[1:37:41] more attentive than the people were
[1:37:43] actually
[1:37:45] and then the chickens were going outside
[1:37:49] the door and they were right up in the
[1:37:50] middle i'm not talking about a foreign
[1:37:51] country i'm not about georgia well
[1:37:56] i guess that's up for debate but that's
[1:37:58] boring
[1:38:00] so some of them folks i know up north
[1:38:02] that would be foreign for some of them
[1:38:04] and you know what friends i don't say
[1:38:07] this is a bragging way i just mean this
[1:38:08] with humility and just just to make a
[1:38:09] point
[1:38:10] i felt just as home and just as at home
[1:38:13] as if i'd have been in the wealthiest
[1:38:14] palace that there would have been
[1:38:17] because when you're not material minded
[1:38:18] you're looking for the holy spirit this
[1:38:20] is what i
[1:38:21] love about my lord jesus i love this
[1:38:23] about him so much
[1:38:25] i've watched him come into big churches
[1:38:27] that are well financed and they've got
[1:38:29] all of the sheetrock
[1:38:30] and the plaster just right and the trim
[1:38:32] jobs are perfect every corner put
[1:38:34] together just exactly
[1:38:35] and brother joe i've watched him come
[1:38:37] down into little old dirty places
[1:38:40] that were like cesspools amen where
[1:38:42] people had used a bathroom not more than
[1:38:44] 10 foot from where we were standing
[1:38:46] and the stink was broken through the
[1:38:47] church amen but the holy ghost come
[1:38:50] right down and that suspect
[1:38:51] as same as he did that big church i love
[1:38:54] that about my lord
[1:38:56] is he's not material minded he does not
[1:38:59] look at what your clothes you're wearing
[1:39:00] whether he can come fill you with the
[1:39:02] holy ghost or not and abide in your
[1:39:03] heart
[1:39:09] this is why some people have to
[1:39:11] understand you must understand this
[1:39:14] god is not basing his feeling on whether
[1:39:17] you've got a certain look on the outside
[1:39:19] or so much money in the bank account
[1:39:21] he's not looking at how well dressed the
[1:39:23] vessel is
[1:39:27] hallelujah right
[1:39:30] but the criterion that he's looking for
[1:39:34] is just be empty it really don't get any
[1:39:37] more difficult than that
[1:39:39] just be empty now friend i don't have to
[1:39:43] come down here
[1:39:44] and start beating on you and driving at
[1:39:46] you about what that means
[1:39:47] your own conscience declares to you what
[1:39:49] it means
[1:39:51] you know the areas of your life that you
[1:39:53] allow
[1:39:55] to be a little rambunctious in maybe a
[1:39:57] little overtaking
[1:39:59] maybe a little bit too strenuous of an
[1:40:01] activity or
[1:40:02] some kind of a thing that takes up all
[1:40:04] of your time and when i say strenuous i
[1:40:06] mean it takes effort
[1:40:08] for some people to sit there three and
[1:40:10] four hours
[1:40:13] looking at a computer
[1:40:18] how many times have you heard this
[1:40:19] remark let me just use this to kind of
[1:40:20] back up what i mean
[1:40:23] people can sit down and move within and
[1:40:24] watch a movie for two hours but they
[1:40:26] can't sit in church for 30 minutes how
[1:40:27] many times you're done
[1:40:34] that's the reason we can't sit in church
[1:40:35] anymore like that
[1:40:37] because we've filled up so much on other
[1:40:39] things
[1:40:44] praise god
[1:40:50] my how rich the church is in goods
[1:40:54] but how poor in spirit blessed be the
[1:40:57] poor for yours is the kingdom of god
[1:40:59] the kingdom of god is not meat and drink
[1:41:05] it is not material glory to god
[1:41:08] it is within us
[1:41:12] a rich man is rich in god not in worldly
[1:41:15] things
[1:41:16] let me give an example what i mean by
[1:41:18] this matthew chapter 12 verse 43 and 44.
[1:41:21] jesus refers back to
[1:41:25] how when a spirit would leave a man and
[1:41:26] watch he said when the unclean spirit
[1:41:28] has gone out of a man he walks through
[1:41:29] dry places seeking rest
[1:41:32] he findeth them then he says i will
[1:41:35] return to my house
[1:41:37] into my house from whence i came out and
[1:41:41] when he has come
[1:41:43] he findeth it empty swept and garnished
[1:41:50] so the very idea that backs up this
[1:41:52] thought of empty
[1:41:54] is that even after a spirit has departed
[1:41:56] from a home
[1:41:57] a house you your body your soul your
[1:42:00] spirit
[1:42:01] it leaves it empty this is the state
[1:42:04] that if a man would remain that way
[1:42:08] then it would only be a matter of time
[1:42:10] before god would make his entrance into
[1:42:12] that very heart
[1:42:14] that's been emptied down but you see
[1:42:16] patience is a difficult thing for us
[1:42:19] because in this age of push button
[1:42:21] everything we want it to happen
[1:42:23] right now and maybe god knows that
[1:42:26] there's areas of your life
[1:42:29] that he wants to wait and see if you're
[1:42:31] willing to be empty for a while let me
[1:42:32] tell you something
[1:42:34] if receiving the holy ghost meant that i
[1:42:38] had to stay in a sanctified position for
[1:42:40] 25 years like we preached abraham a
[1:42:41] couple weeks ago
[1:42:43] if i had to stay sanctified for 25 years
[1:42:46] if that's what it meant to remain
[1:42:47] empty just to prove to god that i was
[1:42:49] willing to do so
[1:42:51] i'd fight with everything i had in me to
[1:42:53] remain empty
[1:42:57] you say brother ben that's ridiculous is
[1:42:59] it so ridiculous
[1:43:01] what do you all reckon that the foolish
[1:43:02] virgins are going to receive eternal
[1:43:04] life because of
[1:43:05] because these are sanctified people
[1:43:08] that remain empty all the way up to the
[1:43:11] last state this is why jesus can put a
[1:43:13] white robe on him
[1:43:14] because when they take their last breath
[1:43:15] on this earth
[1:43:17] those foolish virgins as he referred to
[1:43:20] don't have any devils hiding in them
[1:43:23] they have remained empty
[1:43:25] and they determined in their heart i'll
[1:43:27] never let nothing fill that space
[1:43:29] but the holy ghost i'll tell you
[1:43:33] something
[1:43:34] people come to a preacher they go to
[1:43:36] somebody they got confidence in and they
[1:43:38] want them to
[1:43:41] instantly fix their problems
[1:43:47] and these things are not fixed instantly
[1:43:51] god sometimes will base all of your
[1:43:53] deliverance on your determination and
[1:43:54] how willing you are to fight
[1:43:59] all right brother brandon said just the
[1:44:00] other day going up the road on the way
[1:44:01] to indiana and he said
[1:44:03] fight till all of the symptoms are gone
[1:44:06] like that but what if i have symptoms
[1:44:10] ten years
[1:44:11] i'll bless your heart you want me to get
[1:44:12] you a bottle too
[1:44:14] all right are you willing to be a rugged
[1:44:16] christian are you willing just to give
[1:44:18] up
[1:44:19] you're willing to get the deliverance
[1:44:20] you want or you want them just to throw
[1:44:22] on a towel and quit
[1:44:24] don't forget brother sister the person
[1:44:26] that screamed
[1:44:27] top of their lungs i can't do it i'm
[1:44:29] giving up you are looking at a face of
[1:44:32] god
[1:44:32] and you are telling god with your
[1:44:34] attitude i do not believe what you said
[1:44:36] in your word
[1:44:37] that i can do all things through christ
[1:44:39] which strengthens me you're just as
[1:44:40] guilty as the big braggart walking
[1:44:42] around i can do it all
[1:44:44] you're just as dirty
[1:44:48] all right because a real man or woman
[1:44:52] that's following christ
[1:44:53] they don't use such things as an excuse
[1:44:56] because you already realize in the
[1:44:57] beginning you're a failure in the
[1:44:58] beginning you can't do nothing in the
[1:44:59] beginning
[1:45:00] but this is the attitude of a real son
[1:45:01] of god a real daughter of god lord i'll
[1:45:03] do whatever it takes to stay empty
[1:45:06] until you can occupy me with delivering
[1:45:08] power
[1:45:13] i had several people telling me here
[1:45:14] about a month ago almost in succession
[1:45:16] nearly
[1:45:18] one one one brother told me he was quite
[1:45:20] an older man and he said
[1:45:21] i just keep doing the same thing over
[1:45:23] and over again what do i do i said the
[1:45:24] same thing that you need to keep doing
[1:45:26] which is to keep fighting
[1:45:27] keep repenting keep living right and
[1:45:30] keep doing the thing that you need to do
[1:45:31] to stay
[1:45:32] empty until god can bring you the
[1:45:35] deliverance you need
[1:45:37] here's where people mess up they give up
[1:45:39] at that point
[1:45:40] they reach that spot and they feel like
[1:45:42] well i might as well quit god's not even
[1:45:43] paying attention
[1:45:44] how do you know that
[1:45:48] art thou god oh man stand up and give me
[1:45:50] an answer he said to job
[1:45:51] [Music]
[1:45:54] in other words you don't know what five
[1:45:56] seconds is going gonna hold for your
[1:45:57] life
[1:45:58] you don't know five nanoseconds much
[1:45:59] less the next 50 years of your life
[1:46:01] how dare we we
[1:46:05] take into our hands the very attitude
[1:46:08] that if god don't answer on my terms and
[1:46:10] he ain't gonna answer at all
[1:46:12] shame on us i
[1:46:15] said shame on us
[1:46:18] we ought to be willing to say god no
[1:46:21] matter how long it takes
[1:46:24] if i fail a million times a day if i
[1:46:25] fall on my face a million times a day
[1:46:28] i believe your grace is bigger than my
[1:46:30] failure
[1:46:32] i believe your grace is bigger than my
[1:46:33] mistakes i believe your mercy and your
[1:46:36] love and your blood reaches farther down
[1:46:38] for me than anything else hallelujah
[1:46:43] and because i believe that i refuse to
[1:46:45] quit
[1:46:47] how's expression go winners never quit
[1:46:52] and quitters never win
[1:46:57] we've got to have that iron disposition
[1:46:59] about us to say
[1:47:01] you know what i may not be the best
[1:47:02] christian i may not be the top of the
[1:47:04] game i may not be the best in the
[1:47:06] country
[1:47:06] i may not be the one that god looks at
[1:47:08] and says you are the greatest
[1:47:10] i might be that quote i might be where
[1:47:13] brother brenham said
[1:47:15] the weakest of christians
[1:47:18] that might be me
[1:47:22] fine if i've got a struggle for
[1:47:25] everything i've got to struggle
[1:47:27] at the end of the day i'm still a
[1:47:28] christian at the end of the day i'm
[1:47:31] still going to get something out of god
[1:47:34] even if it's the crumbs from the master
[1:47:35] staple
[1:47:39] the lord showed me something preaching
[1:47:40] the other day that blessed me so much
[1:47:43] you know when the stephanie woman come
[1:47:45] and he said you're a dog
[1:47:47] put her down remember all that you know
[1:47:49] that's a racial slur
[1:47:52] do you know that did you know to call
[1:47:55] somebody a dog like that is to call them
[1:47:57] a racial slur
[1:47:59] that was a hybrid group of people
[1:48:02] that the dog was spoke of as the lowest
[1:48:05] thing on the planet
[1:48:07] and he so insulted her
[1:48:11] that humanly speaking she had a right to
[1:48:13] say forget it then
[1:48:19] but you know what she did now jesus put
[1:48:22] her in that
[1:48:23] rutted place she went even a step lower
[1:48:26] than that if you look at the original
[1:48:28] translation of this scripture
[1:48:30] she didn't say the dogs eat from the
[1:48:32] master's table the original translation
[1:48:34] sent the scofield bible as well if you'd
[1:48:35] like get a school field
[1:48:36] but in the original translation she said
[1:48:38] but the little dogs
[1:48:42] she didn't even make herself an adult
[1:48:44] dog
[1:48:46] she made herself even lower than that
[1:48:49] but even the little dogs
[1:48:54] no wonder jesus looked at her and said
[1:48:56] woman
[1:48:58] i haven't found faith like this
[1:49:02] in all of israel
[1:49:07] blessed are the poor in spirit a little
[1:49:10] bit further thank you
[1:49:12] it's going to anyways i just thought i'd
[1:49:14] be polite and ask
[1:49:20] and luke chapter 1 46-53 and i'm just
[1:49:22] going to
[1:49:23] kind of cover these you don't have to
[1:49:25] turn unless you want to but i'm going to
[1:49:26] move pretty fast so if you want to write
[1:49:27] them down it'll be good
[1:49:28] too luke 1 46 and then verse 53 and mary
[1:49:31] said my soul doth magnify the lord
[1:49:34] listen
[1:49:34] he hath filled the hungry with good
[1:49:37] things
[1:49:38] and the rich he has sent empty
[1:49:41] away not so much the rich in money
[1:49:45] but those that had no need of nothing
[1:49:47] remember
[1:49:49] the very testament of laocia
[1:49:53] was we have need of
[1:49:58] god help us message people
[1:50:02] listen to my trumpet this morning
[1:50:04] blowing
[1:50:06] we have arrived with the same attitude
[1:50:08] among our people
[1:50:10] we've got to where we've heard it all
[1:50:12] we've read it all we've been preached to
[1:50:14] about all of it
[1:50:15] and when we come to the house of god
[1:50:18] we're so full that we don't want to hear
[1:50:22] anymore
[1:50:24] god empty me out lord
[1:50:27] and help me empty out
[1:50:31] until you can fill me with your presence
[1:50:33] proverbs chapter 16 19
[1:50:35] better it is to be of humble spirit with
[1:50:37] the lowly
[1:50:38] then divide the spoil with the proud so
[1:50:42] proverbs 29 23 and a man's pride shall
[1:50:45] bring him low
[1:50:47] but honor shall uphold the humble in
[1:50:50] spirit empty in spirit remember humility
[1:50:53] is not the act of humility
[1:50:55] you get this fake stuff with people
[1:50:57] sometimes you know when they say
[1:50:59] boy i enjoyed that song just an old
[1:51:02] spare tire
[1:51:06] now if you don't mean that from your
[1:51:07] heart you're putting that on
[1:51:10] if you don't really feel that way about
[1:51:11] yourself you're putting that on
[1:51:13] better to just say be gracious and say
[1:51:15] thank you appreciate that
[1:51:17] then to put on some kind of a fake act
[1:51:19] that everybody can see you are a fake is
[1:51:20] a three dollar bill
[1:51:23] humble is not about walking around i've
[1:51:26] seen people in my years coming up
[1:51:27] they clutch their bible everywhere they
[1:51:29] go and they never laugh that's one of
[1:51:31] the first signs of being a sinner you
[1:51:32] know is laughing a lot
[1:51:35] sir it is with some people if you want
[1:51:37] to laugh or have humor or joke or any
[1:51:39] kind of a thing like that god they think
[1:51:40] you're sinning for sure
[1:51:42] and whatever you do don't be joyous
[1:51:44] don't do it
[1:51:45] because if you're going to be humble
[1:51:47] humble means to be miserable
[1:51:49] but happy in the lord don't laugh
[1:51:57] they think this is humility and every
[1:51:59] time they open their mouth
[1:52:01] amen amen
[1:52:04] that's not humility humility is the
[1:52:07] simple act of being empty so god can
[1:52:09] fill you
[1:52:11] it's really that simple praise god
[1:52:15] matthew 18 verse 4 whoever therefore
[1:52:18] shall humble himself
[1:52:19] as this little child
[1:52:23] i did this with you many years ago but
[1:52:24] you ain't a little boy no more
[1:52:28] you take that baby sitting back here by
[1:52:30] the middle of the robe all them
[1:52:31] disciples
[1:52:32] i'm the greatest i'm the greatest i
[1:52:35] jesus took that little boy
[1:52:36] coming
[1:52:39] put him in front and said whoever comes
[1:52:41] like this
[1:52:43] that'll be the greatest among you you
[1:52:45] see what jesus is talking about
[1:52:47] a child doesn't have any preconceived
[1:52:48] notions they haven't been taught
[1:52:51] anything about race
[1:52:52] they haven't been taught anything about
[1:52:54] hatred they haven't been
[1:52:56] been programmed with a lot of those kind
[1:52:57] of things because you will watch a white
[1:52:59] child play with a black
[1:53:00] yellow red just the same as they would
[1:53:03] any other child and they don't even
[1:53:04] think about the color of the skin
[1:53:08] that's one example of many things i
[1:53:09] could be talking about
[1:53:12] jesus said become like that empty
[1:53:16] matthew 23 12 and whosoever shall exalt
[1:53:19] himself shall be a beast
[1:53:21] so the way up is down the way down
[1:53:24] is up see what i mean what we talk about
[1:53:28] in the bible our definitions of the
[1:53:30] bible
[1:53:30] is not the same definitions as what we
[1:53:32] look at
[1:53:34] because any gps on my phone will tell
[1:53:35] you up is this way
[1:53:37] if i tried to go that way is it
[1:53:38] recalculating recalculating
[1:53:40] recalculating
[1:53:41] and i'm not supposed to go you
[1:53:43] understand
[1:53:45] if i go a direction i'm not supposed to
[1:53:46] go that thing will squall at me until i
[1:53:48] either shut her up or
[1:53:50] or go the direction i'm supposed to well
[1:53:52] you see that's what the bible does
[1:53:53] we start getting a lot of pride and a
[1:53:55] lot of things going listen that little
[1:53:56] voice inside of you going recalculating
[1:53:58] recalculating recalculating
[1:54:02] yeah because the way up is down
[1:54:06] whoever obeys himself
[1:54:09] i like the example brother potter used a
[1:54:11] number of years ago and i could take
[1:54:12] books maybe i'll just
[1:54:13] show it if you take a stack of books
[1:54:16] like this
[1:54:17] you could throw something at those books
[1:54:19] and knock every one of them down except
[1:54:20] for the bottom one
[1:54:22] because the one on the bottom is already
[1:54:23] down it'll have to be knocked anywhere
[1:54:27] a christian that stays in that position
[1:54:29] all the time they are the ones that god
[1:54:31] blesses with so much
[1:54:34] things that people don't know nothing
[1:54:35] about
[1:54:38] let me hurry james chapter 4 verse 6 and
[1:54:42] then verse 10
[1:54:43] but he giveth more grace wherefore he
[1:54:46] saith god resisteth the proud and giveth
[1:54:48] grace unto the humble
[1:54:50] humble your their yourselves in the
[1:54:52] sight of the lord and he shall lift you
[1:54:55] up
[1:54:55] so what does that mean to be humbled in
[1:54:57] the sight of the lord does that mean
[1:54:58] when you come to church
[1:55:00] you know you're you're pious you walk
[1:55:03] very gently
[1:55:05] very quietly and when you say praise the
[1:55:06] lord you're careful praise the lord
[1:55:11] do you understand somebody of total
[1:55:13] humility
[1:55:14] could see somebody passed out drunk
[1:55:16] rolling on the floor slobbering on the
[1:55:17] side of their mouth
[1:55:18] speaking of tongue that's not our idea
[1:55:22] of humility
[1:55:24] but uh maybe that's the reason we don't
[1:55:28] see enough of that around the message
[1:55:30] and i do say enough and i meant what i
[1:55:31] said and i said what a minute
[1:55:33] we don't see enough of that around the
[1:55:35] message because
[1:55:37] we've gotten so filled up with our ways
[1:55:40] to levitate god almost absolute
[1:55:43] miraculous heaven-sent revival
[1:55:46] some odd strange thing to even get us in
[1:55:50] such a state of worship
[1:55:55] why because we're too full
[1:56:01] if we ever get empty that's the kind of
[1:56:04] worship you can expect to come out of
[1:56:06] your life
[1:56:07] the kind of worship where if i'm looking
[1:56:10] down through walmart
[1:56:12] i remember brother batman said have
[1:56:13] wisdom about things don't be cutting
[1:56:14] obviously the holy spirit could be
[1:56:15] cutting you up on a street quarter form
[1:56:17] full of people he said but you use
[1:56:18] wisdom
[1:56:20] and if i'm walking through walmart or
[1:56:22] some lowe's or something place and i
[1:56:24] have many times
[1:56:24] and the holy ghost was working on me
[1:56:26] dealing man i feel so blessed
[1:56:28] i look around i see ain't nobody around
[1:56:30] i start going thank you jesus tears
[1:56:31] running out of my eyes
[1:56:33] somebody come around the corner
[1:56:36] well that's not being ashamed of friends
[1:56:38] just use some wisdom
[1:56:40] but i could be so blessed why if you're
[1:56:43] empty
[1:56:45] that's what he can do for you so the
[1:56:48] answer to your question is how do i feel
[1:56:50] that
[1:56:52] be empty you need to probably spend a
[1:56:55] lot of time
[1:56:56] emptying yourself before you start
[1:56:58] asking for a blessing
[1:57:00] all right remember when you come to this
[1:57:02] platform asking the preacher to bless
[1:57:03] you
[1:57:04] that's what we do when we pray over you
[1:57:06] and we ask that god heal your body
[1:57:08] you leave the platform with the blessing
[1:57:11] of our prayers
[1:57:12] that is a blessing to you lay hands on
[1:57:14] the sick they shall recover the prayer
[1:57:16] of faith shall save the sick that's a
[1:57:17] blessing
[1:57:19] and i don't mean to imply that's just
[1:57:20] preachers i could be down at your
[1:57:22] sister's house or somebody full of the
[1:57:23] holy ghost but you leave after prayer
[1:57:25] with the blessing of that prayer on your
[1:57:26] life before you ask for that blessing
[1:57:30] how much time do me and you do we spend
[1:57:33] just saying okay god
[1:57:35] i need to empty out my feeling about
[1:57:37] this
[1:57:40] because i really want you to heal my
[1:57:41] body but i've got a lot of doubts that's
[1:57:42] going to happen
[1:57:44] but no see see we don't want to go to
[1:57:46] them rutted places like that
[1:57:48] we want to pretend like everything is
[1:57:49] okay nothing to see here move along
[1:57:52] rather than get down bare knuckle honest
[1:57:54] with ourself
[1:57:56] what's wrong with admitting you know
[1:57:57] what i've got a lot of doubt
[1:58:00] actually you know what i believe that's
[1:58:01] one reason why the lord healed my eyes
[1:58:03] like he did
[1:58:04] because when i was standing out in that
[1:58:06] yard after getting that first diagnosis
[1:58:07] and i was standing out there
[1:58:09] i looked at the lord and i said god
[1:58:14] i don't believe you can heal this
[1:58:15] diabetes in my body and then i told him
[1:58:17] it's not that i don't believe you're a
[1:58:18] healer but for all of the reasons that i
[1:58:21] feel like
[1:58:22] i've battled weight my whole life i've
[1:58:23] always been good and bad
[1:58:26] friends i'm not a lazy person at some
[1:58:29] point in my life i'm probably gonna die
[1:58:31] from overworking
[1:58:34] but honestly i stood there in new york
[1:58:35] and i said lord it's not that i don't
[1:58:36] believe you're a healer i just don't
[1:58:37] believe you're gonna heal me
[1:58:40] and i had a list of reasons why i just
[1:58:41] felt like he could not perform this
[1:58:43] miracle in my life
[1:58:45] and you don't understand maybe if you're
[1:58:46] not a preacher but being a preacher
[1:58:48] complicates it even more so because
[1:58:51] there's elements to your call that you
[1:58:53] realize that those gifts are not for you
[1:58:55] they're for the people and because
[1:58:58] you're built in a way that you want to
[1:58:59] see the people bless
[1:59:00] not yourself have a hard time believing
[1:59:03] for me
[1:59:04] one of the most difficult things i can
[1:59:06] ever do actually is to believe god can
[1:59:08] do something for me
[1:59:11] i am just as amazed it is profound to me
[1:59:14] that the lord did what he did because i
[1:59:16] honestly couldn't believe it would
[1:59:17] happen for me
[1:59:20] and when i stood there and i told him
[1:59:22] lord
[1:59:24] i'm just going to tell you i just don't
[1:59:26] believe it can happen for me but
[1:59:28] i'm taking all of that all of my feeling
[1:59:33] and i'm letting you know i'm in a such
[1:59:35] desperation that i know if you don't
[1:59:37] move for me
[1:59:37] i'm in trouble what happened
[1:59:42] i just simply reached the spot where i
[1:59:44] could empty myself out
[1:59:47] then he could do what he did
[1:59:50] if we don't come to that place of
[1:59:52] desperation friend
[1:59:54] we'll never empty out like we need to
[1:59:58] don't look at your trials and things
[1:59:59] you've gone through as being a bad thing
[2:00:01] god might be trying to shake your cherry
[2:00:02] tree down
[2:00:04] huh he might be rattling your cage for a
[2:00:10] reason
[2:00:13] oh my yeah that's right
[2:00:16] lord jesus i know that if i had the
[2:00:18] ability to read minds and hear thoughts
[2:00:21] i know there is a metropolis of activity
[2:00:23] going on this place right now
[2:00:27] but you see that's exactly the point i'm
[2:00:28] making
[2:00:30] your minds right now are running 400
[2:00:33] miles in every direction
[2:00:35] and listen don't tell me i've been
[2:00:36] preaching in 30 years i know they'll
[2:00:37] look on that face i've seen that around
[2:00:38] the world
[2:00:40] but this is the point i'm trying to
[2:00:42] teach you this morning
[2:00:43] you need to stop that right now stop and
[2:00:46] take all of that activity and stop and
[2:00:48] say lord
[2:00:49] all of that i'm giving that to you now
[2:00:53] all of them thoughts all of that
[2:00:54] confusion all of those questions
[2:00:57] i'm yielding that up to you and emptying
[2:00:59] that out
[2:01:01] don't you see the answer is not for me
[2:01:03] to go another hour and work out all of
[2:01:05] your thinking
[2:01:07] that is not the answer to your problem
[2:01:12] the answer and that's where the devil
[2:01:13] gets you hung up because this thought
[2:01:15] will go that way and it'll connect with
[2:01:16] that thought and give birth to
[2:01:18] 10 more what do i do about this and oh i
[2:01:20] felt that way that
[2:01:21] and all of that activity you know what
[2:01:23] it's doing to you
[2:01:25] is keeping you full
[2:01:29] so if you want to really get to the
[2:01:31] place where god can bless you right here
[2:01:32] this morning right now
[2:01:34] now take all of that thoughts all of
[2:01:35] that activity and just push it up to him
[2:01:37] say lord
[2:01:38] i'm giving all of that to you
[2:01:43] and then be honest with yourself and
[2:01:45] just admit i don't know the answer
[2:01:48] i don't know the way out of it
[2:01:51] but i'm emptying out so you can fill me
[2:01:53] up
[2:01:59] one more scripture let's pray first
[2:02:02] peter five and five likewise younger
[2:02:03] submit yourself to the elder yea
[2:02:05] all of you be subject subject one to
[2:02:06] another and be clothed with humility
[2:02:11] for god resists the proud
[2:02:15] and giveth grace to the humble
[2:02:18] how many of you want grace
[2:02:24] what better way what better avenue
[2:02:28] for god to send grace to your doorstep
[2:02:32] than through the avenue of humility
[2:02:35] did you know brother brandon said one of
[2:02:37] the first things god first things that
[2:02:39] god gives to you when you receive the
[2:02:40] holy ghost
[2:02:41] is humility
[2:02:45] humility
[2:02:50] asparagus musicians god bless you but i
[2:02:53] want you to stay seated for a moment
[2:02:56] this kind of sermon goes for all of us
[2:02:58] and if you go to your service and you go
[2:02:59] to your duty right away you're going to
[2:03:01] miss your opportunity to pray as well
[2:03:03] i'll call you in just a moment but hold
[2:03:05] still for just a minute
[2:03:08] now friends with your head's bound and
[2:03:11] your heart's open
[2:03:14] at this point in the service there is
[2:03:17] not a preacher
[2:03:18] in this world that can do for you what
[2:03:22] you can do for yourself
[2:03:23] right now by simply telling the lord
[2:03:29] god as i said here with my head bowed my
[2:03:32] heart open
[2:03:34] i'm asking you to take all of my
[2:03:36] confusions and experiences and
[2:03:39] thoughts and thanking
[2:03:42] i'm giving all of that to you right now
[2:03:47] and lord i'm emptying myself
[2:03:51] out so you can fill me up with yourself
[2:03:56] remember be determined while you pray
[2:04:00] that if god doesn't fill you immediately
[2:04:03] understand that he is testing your
[2:04:05] character and your feeling toward him
[2:04:07] and his word
[2:04:09] and you also say these words in your
[2:04:11] heart and lord
[2:04:13] while i sit here in your presence
[2:04:15] yielding my thoughts my thanking my
[2:04:16] motives my objectives everything to you
[2:04:18] i am also telling you lord i am
[2:04:21] determined to stay empty
[2:04:23] for as long as it takes add that to your
[2:04:26] prayers well don't forget that part is
[2:04:28] important
[2:04:30] i'm emptying but i'm also determined to
[2:04:34] stay empty lord
[2:04:38] god my hands are up to you this morning
[2:04:39] jesus
[2:04:42] lord i'm not a possessor of everything i
[2:04:44] preached this morning i need it to
[2:04:48] other elements of my life and elements
[2:04:51] of my walk with you
[2:04:52] where i fall so short
[2:04:55] little thoughts and things and thankings
[2:04:57] and trainings and stuff that just creeps
[2:05:00] its old ugly head back up
[2:05:02] lord those things that just can't seem
[2:05:03] to squash them somehow
[2:05:05] but lamb of god no matter what kind of
[2:05:09] battles or trials or things we've got to
[2:05:11] go through
[2:05:12] this is what they call cutting to the
[2:05:15] chase
[2:05:17] where lord we go right to the heart of
[2:05:18] the matter this is the heart of the
[2:05:20] matter
[2:05:24] and if by your spirit we can empty our
[2:05:26] hearts today in our minds and our
[2:05:28] thinking
[2:05:28] and motives and objectives and those
[2:05:30] things the lord i know beyond the shadow
[2:05:32] of a doubt
[2:05:33] you can perform exactly what you
[2:05:34] promised in your word which is to fill
[2:05:36] us
[2:05:37] with grace to fill us with joy
[2:05:42] there's so many things coming in this
[2:05:44] supernatural atmosphere
[2:05:46] with the angel of the lord here in the
[2:05:47] word of the ministry and
[2:05:49] no doubt the angels of god in this
[2:05:51] building right now and the holy spirit
[2:05:52] here and
[2:05:53] feeling all of this supernatural around
[2:05:55] me lord it's just little things just
[2:05:57] keep coming it's like popcorn now
[2:05:59] like those rocket ships brother i'm
[2:06:00] telling them roman candles
[2:06:02] things are bursting all around me i
[2:06:03] start thinking different thoughts lord
[2:06:06] such as a person with depression maybe
[2:06:08] the reason they can't be filled with joy
[2:06:10] and peace is because they've allowed
[2:06:12] their thoughts of depression to crowd
[2:06:14] out that real
[2:06:14] thing of joy lord you take a person that
[2:06:18] just
[2:06:19] arrogant all the time and all the time
[2:06:21] brother talked about that as being a
[2:06:23] complex
[2:06:24] lord where their thoughts dwell and what
[2:06:26] they feed on and how they think and what
[2:06:28] they do and how they react
[2:06:30] and mannerisms and all of that it just
[2:06:32] becomes stuff that fills us up or we
[2:06:34] can't
[2:06:35] the holy spirit has no way in
[2:06:38] so lord if there's ever been anything
[2:06:41] i've ever preached that i believe could
[2:06:43] be as beneficial to the people of god as
[2:06:45] anything it's this message right here
[2:06:47] this morning that you've given us
[2:06:49] because lord jesus i see the answer to
[2:06:52] many of our problems laying in these
[2:06:54] words
[2:06:55] blessed are the poor in the spirit
[2:06:58] because your prophet would go on to tell
[2:07:00] us in the book of romans
[2:07:02] that the kingdom of god is not meat and
[2:07:04] drink but joy and peace
[2:07:06] in the holy ghost so lord it goes
[2:07:09] to prove to us that if we're full if
[2:07:12] we're too full
[2:07:14] then you cannot fill us with your pl
[2:07:16] with your presence
[2:07:17] it's not that you won't it's not that
[2:07:20] you can't it's just lord we have to be
[2:07:24] in a position to be able to receive it
[2:07:28] help your people this morning lord as
[2:07:31] many of them lord as i've looked at
[2:07:32] across the audience while praying here
[2:07:35] just to kind of gauge where what might
[2:07:37] be going on
[2:07:38] to see lord what you might be doing i
[2:07:40] see dears and i
[2:07:42] as i see hands raised up and different
[2:07:44] people praying saying different things
[2:07:45] and our
[2:07:46] mouths are moving and lord jesus i have
[2:07:48] no doubt that they're in the same place
[2:07:50] i am
[2:07:51] they know their lives they know where
[2:07:53] they're at and they know they need your
[2:07:54] help
[2:07:55] and so father this kind of sermon that
[2:07:57] motivates us and challenges us to look
[2:07:59] inwardly
[2:08:01] and as humans we feel so helpless
[2:08:05] but god let us take that feeling of
[2:08:08] helplessness let us yield that to you as
[2:08:09] well
[2:08:12] could be completely empty help your
[2:08:15] children this morning reach that spot
[2:08:18] that they can be filled up with what
[2:08:19] they need and lord
[2:08:21] if there be a purpose in making us wait
[2:08:24] then lord fill us or at least grant to
[2:08:28] us
[2:08:29] the determination the resiliency
[2:08:34] and maybe in a manner of speaking a
[2:08:36] stubbornness almost
[2:08:38] i don't know how to say lord but not
[2:08:41] necessarily an evil type stubborn way
[2:08:42] but just a just grit i guess
[2:08:46] that if we've got to stay empty for 100
[2:08:49] years whatever
[2:08:50] it takes i'd rather die an empty
[2:08:53] christian than one filled up with the
[2:08:54] world
[2:08:56] or at least a potentially empty
[2:08:57] christian
[2:09:00] help us lord i pray in jesus
[2:09:04] name amen
[2:09:09] hallelujah
[2:09:12] hallelujah now friends you may not know
[2:09:16] what to do right now let me instruct you
[2:09:18] the holy ghost has heard your prayers
[2:09:21] he's heard your heart
[2:09:22] what you need to do right now is you
[2:09:24] need to take time to thank him
[2:09:26] give him praise for what he's done so
[2:09:28] right there what you're saying just
[2:09:29] raise your hands up say lord
[2:09:31] i want to take this moment to thank you
[2:09:35] thank you for speaking to me thank you
[2:09:37] for moving on me
[2:09:39] thank you for anointing your servant
[2:09:41] today lord to speak these things
[2:09:43] thank you god for letting the songs fall
[2:09:45] on the right orders
[2:09:47] lord even the songs we sang led right up
[2:09:49] to these moments
[2:09:50] father the song service and everything
[2:09:52] was just perfect
[2:09:54] lord jesus we want to thank you today
[2:09:58] for using your word in such a
[2:10:01] manner thank you lord for hearing my
[2:10:05] prayer and as i walk out of here an
[2:10:06] empty vessel
[2:10:08] lord i'm putting my steak down thank you
[2:10:10] so much lord
[2:10:12] thank you so much for speaking to me
[2:10:15] hallelujah
[2:10:17] now just tell him with your mouth i
[2:10:18] believe you lord
[2:10:20] just speak your faith out i'm trusting
[2:10:23] you jesus
[2:10:24] i'm receiving it today god i'm receiving
[2:10:27] it lord
[2:10:28] i'm believing that i'll walk out of here
[2:10:30] different than i've ever been before
[2:10:34] because the holy spirit has shown us the
[2:10:37] way
[2:10:38] so now we just have to continue thanking
[2:10:40] him and walk that same way
[2:10:42] every day this is the kind of sermon
[2:10:44] when you wake up tomorrow
[2:10:45] you do the same thing tomorrow that

[2:11:10] you may not believe it but great things
[2:11:12] are happening right now i'm telling you
[2:11:13] that
[2:11:16] great things have already transpired you
[2:11:18] say great
[2:11:20] ain't nobody shouting or nobody rolling
[2:11:21] in the floor hey
[2:11:24] the sun got up this morning and drew
[2:11:26] millions of gallons of water up into the
[2:11:28] atmosphere and we never even heard it
[2:11:32] don't think that great things are always
[2:11:34] noisy things
[2:11:37] sometimes god moves in silence
[2:11:40] hallelujah thank you lord
[2:11:45] all right musicians come if you will
[2:11:47] let's sing before we go
[2:11:50] praise the lord stand with me if you
[2:11:52] will
[2:12:02] i've never preached anything in my life
[2:12:04] that was inspired that was it
[2:12:10] i'm standing outstanding here amazed
[2:12:11] this morning by the time with the words
[2:12:13] of the lord
[2:12:13] [Music]
[2:12:15] it's absolutely perfect just everything
[2:12:18] perfect
[2:12:20] i'm telling brother sister whenever god
[2:12:22] wants to visit us in his word like that
[2:12:24] i don't take it lightly when he talks to
[2:12:27] us like that i don't take it lightly
[2:12:30] because when he's got those kind of
[2:12:31] things to say to us i say lord
[2:12:34] help me because you know when it comes
[2:12:37] powerful like that sometimes that means
[2:12:38] it's the turning of a corner you know
[2:12:43] don't forget that when the seals was
[2:12:45] getting ready to be opened
[2:12:47] they broke the sound barrier first then
[2:12:50] they had their picture taken next
[2:12:52] it was the turning of a corner closing
[2:12:55] out of the gentile age as far as
[2:12:57] pentecost and those people go
[2:12:58] and now opening up the way for the bride
[2:13:00] of jesus christ to find her position
[2:13:02] it all turned that corner great things
[2:13:05] powerful things were happening all at
[2:13:06] once
[2:13:08] when the lord speaks to people the way
[2:13:09] i've saw him speak this morning
[2:13:11] and heard him speak this morning that
[2:13:13] means great things are in a store for us
[2:13:15] it's just business people
[2:13:17] hallelujah and you get that out of your
[2:13:19] mind that i'm thinking that about me
[2:13:21] i'm talking about him i'm talking about
[2:13:23] his word i'm just an old
[2:13:25] lump of clay being used to say things
[2:13:29] and ain't got nothing to do with me

[2:13:32] because if you're under conviction so am

[2:16:14] oh god help me lord
[2:16:18] help me lord listen buddy it ain't gonna
[2:16:22] be an easy thing
[2:16:24] because don't forget the devil been

[2:16:30] and he'd been watching he sees your
[2:16:33] commitment
[2:16:34] he sees the dedication and the thing you
[2:16:36] said to the lord this morning
[2:16:38] it reads your heart or your thoughts or
[2:16:39] nothing but if you even said lord help
[2:16:41] me he sees all that
[2:16:43] he said listen be smart be wise
[2:16:47] not mentally intelligent but be
[2:16:49] spiritually intelligent
[2:16:51] tomorrow and the next day and maybe a
[2:16:52] month from now or a week from now watch
[2:16:54] for those little attacks that's going to
[2:16:56] come
[2:16:57] trying to fill you back in just don't
[2:16:59] let him do it
[2:17:01] just don't let him do it every time
[2:17:04] something comes in there
[2:17:05] root it right out right away get a
[2:17:07] shovel spade
[2:17:08] take your bare hands and dig that thing
[2:17:10] out i said lord no no i'm determined
[2:17:13] i'm gonna stay empty god bless you
[2:17:16] friends i love you

[2:17:23] [Music]
[2:17:25] i enjoyed the message this morning amen
[2:17:29] [Music]
[2:17:31] amen amen i can just imagine
[2:17:36] the holy spirit i can just imagine jesus
[2:17:39] trying to tell us that he just would
[2:17:42] like a little more room
[2:17:43] in our life amen he knows how busy we
[2:17:47] are
[2:17:48] you know even our schedule is really
[2:17:51] full
[2:17:52] isn't it we have a really full schedule
[2:17:56] sometimes we won't even hardly sing the
[2:17:58] last song some of us got to go
[2:18:00] we're so busy our schedule is so full
[2:18:04] amen instead of maybe just basking in
[2:18:06] the presence of the lord a little bit
[2:18:08] longer and
[2:18:09] amen and worshiping them a little bit
[2:18:11] more fellowshipping with one another
[2:18:14] i mean that's the way it is with him we
[2:18:15] have definitely have full schedule
[2:18:18] our minds full everything like a brother
[2:18:21] said
[2:18:22] amen we have to make room for him i mean
[2:18:25] he wants to just do that to god
[2:18:28] i want to make more room for you lord
