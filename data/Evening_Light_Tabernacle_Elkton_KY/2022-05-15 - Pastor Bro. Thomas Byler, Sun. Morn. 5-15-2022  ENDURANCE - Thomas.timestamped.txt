[28:31] good good morning everyone it's good day
[28:33] a good day to be in the house the lord
[28:35] stand with me if you will
[28:37] um
[28:41] we'll just ask brother austin to open us
[28:43] up and pray
[29:11] children can be dismissed to sunday
[29:13] high school
[29:18] turn with me if you will to
[29:20] isaiah d4
[29:42] seeing o bear thou that does not bear
[29:46] break forth into singing and cry loud
[29:49] thou that it's not travail with child
[29:52] for more are the children of the
[29:54] desolate than the children of the
[29:56] married wife saith the lord
[30:10] for thou shalt break forth on the right
[30:13] hand and on the left and thy seed shall
[30:15] inherit the gentiles and make the
[30:18] desolate cities to be inhabited
[30:39] foreign husband the lord of hosts is his
[30:41] name and i redeemer the holy one of
[30:45] israel the god of the whole earth shall
[30:48] be shall he be called
[31:02] for a small moment have i forsaken thee
[31:05] but with great mercies will i gather
[31:07] thee
[31:19] for this is as the waters of noah unto
[31:22] me
[31:23] for as i have sworn that the waters of
[31:26] noah should no more go over the earth
[31:29] so have i sworn that i would not be
[31:32] roth with the nor rebuke thee
[31:49] oh though afflicted tossed and tempest
[31:52] and not comforted behold i will lay thy
[31:55] stones with fair colors and lay thy
[31:58] foundations with sapphires
[32:11] and all thy children shall be taught of
[32:13] the lord and great shall be the peace of
[32:16] thy children
[32:29] behold they shall surely gather together
[32:32] but not by me whosoever
[32:36] shall gather together against thee shall
[32:38] fall for thy sake
[32:51] this last one together no weapon has
[32:54] formed against thee shall prosper and
[32:57] every tongue that shall rise against
[32:59] thee in judgment thou shalt condemn
[33:02] this is the heritage of the servants of
[33:04] the lord and their righteousness is of
[33:07] me saith lord
[33:08] you can be seated
[33:22] morning brothers and sisters
[33:25] you know you could
[33:27] you could take those what how many
[33:29] verses were there
[33:31] those 17 verses and you could go from
[33:33] one end from genesis 1 1 all the way to
[33:37] revelations and you could
[33:39] historically bring out all the things
[33:41] that the jewish people went through in
[33:43] their struggle
[33:46] but the one thing that this chapter in
[33:48] isaiah says no matter what it was
[33:51] god didn't forsake him it might have
[33:53] looked the circumstance might have
[33:55] looked bad for him on the outside
[33:57] but god gave him a promise that he would
[34:00] take care of him and nourish him that's
[34:02] a comforting thought
[34:04] um i wasn't here last sunday but
[34:08] when i got to offering the
[34:10] uh the amount for um
[34:13] that was donated last sunday
[34:16] the offering sunday was twelve thousand
[34:19] six hundred and seventy one dollars and
[34:22] i hadn't made that deposit yet but i'll
[34:24] make it tomorrow or tuesday so that's as
[34:27] of this morning
[34:29] um
[34:30] and i was just gonna go over a few
[34:32] things
[34:34] um
[34:35] the uh principle i'm
[34:37] saying this the principal amount left on
[34:39] the church is uh 72
[34:42] 372.49
[34:46] that's
[34:47] as of
[34:48] as of the last time i made a payment i
[34:51] know like i've told you before we're
[34:52] going into december so
[34:55] i don't i don't really add a lot
[34:58] to the
[34:59] principal map through the sum where i i
[35:03] kind of stay close to what the payment
[35:05] is but
[35:06] going at this rate
[35:07] i i told you on january or in december
[35:10] we'd be at 68 000
[35:13] by one january of 2023 at the lower
[35:16] terrace
[35:18] we're going to be well below 68 000
[35:21] as long as everything stays the same
[35:24] uh in the general fund right now
[35:27] uh is
[35:29] was 10
[35:30] 638
[35:32] and
[35:35] so that's what's in the general fund
[35:37] right now and uh and we have had no
[35:41] problem making the uh
[35:43] the building payment every month so
[35:46] that's been lord's bless us there
[35:50] i had him i told him to come top off the
[35:53] propane for the for the summer
[35:56] but i don't know i don't know if they've
[35:58] done it or not
[36:00] before i i was a little concerned about
[36:02] i was trying to get them to do it before
[36:04] the fuel prices weren't keep going up
[36:06] but i don't know if they've done it or
[36:08] not if they haven't i might wait and
[36:10] tell them to hold and waiting to see
[36:12] what goes on with the fuel prices if
[36:15] they don't get any better it's going to
[36:16] be worse
[36:18] next year than it was this year so
[36:20] that's where we're at right there
[36:22] and like i've always told you before if
[36:24] you have any questions you know don't be
[36:26] afraid to ask me
[36:28] and i appreciate all your prayers i i
[36:31] guess last time i wasn't able to make it
[36:34] my blood pressure was all over the place
[36:37] and
[36:38] if you don't know anything about me i'm
[36:39] one of them guys i've never had that's
[36:41] something i've never had a problem i've
[36:44] always had low blood pressure low pulse
[36:46] rate never had a problem with it so
[36:48] i appreciate your prayers you know
[36:51] you know i'm finding out i'm going to be
[36:52] 63 here soon and maybe a little
[36:55] testimony
[36:56] and you all know me i'm just one of
[36:58] those guys i don't hold anything back if
[37:00] i'm going to do something i do it with
[37:02] everything that i have within me but as
[37:04] you get older you realize you're in a
[37:07] fight your body's saying you're not
[37:08] going to do that anymore and your mind
[37:10] and your spirit's telling your body well
[37:12] we are going to keep doing that you have
[37:14] to
[37:15] i'm not going to surrender to that
[37:17] you all know me pretty well but your
[37:19] body's trying to tell you one thing and
[37:21] your mind's trying to tell you something
[37:22] else and sometimes
[37:24] the two don't always agree
[37:26] and you wind up fighting each other and
[37:29] and sometimes the body wins and
[37:30] sometimes the mind wins that's just the
[37:32] way life is but if you return with me to
[37:35] uh
[37:37] and uh
[37:39] some of you are nurses you probably you
[37:42] probably know my arthritis is not
[37:44] getting any better it never gets better
[37:47] it only gets worse
[37:48] do i do i dwell on it
[37:51] no i don't dwell on it you know i just
[37:53] you just have to live with it and i
[37:56] would tell all you young men uh
[37:58] you
[37:59] they you know
[38:01] when
[38:02] you're young you don't think you're ever
[38:04] gonna get hurt but you know i'm 63 i'd
[38:07] say that a second time but i've probably
[38:09] broken every major bone in my body
[38:11] through my life
[38:12] and you know sometimes you you have an
[38:14] accident or you do something stupid you
[38:17] know you're laying there on the ground
[38:18] or laying in a belt wherever it is you
[38:20] wait you say to yourself thank you lord
[38:22] i'm not dead
[38:23] but then you might then
[38:25] you say to yourself you know might not
[38:27] have been the smartest thing to do i
[38:29] maybe could have done it better before i
[38:31] did it wrong you know so you're not as
[38:34] individ you know you're not as
[38:35] indestructible as you think you are so
[38:38] you get to a point you know you break
[38:39] enough bones in your life you do enough
[38:41] stupid stuff
[38:43] the older you get you're going to find
[38:45] out that you pay for it so
[38:47] i don't know if that helps anyone out
[38:49] but it sooner or later it'll come to
[38:51] fruition but if you return with me to
[38:53] the sixth chapter of
[38:55] of the gospel of john
[39:01] you know i was thinking this morning i
[39:02] was listening to a couple of messages
[39:05] this morning in my office brother
[39:06] branham was talking but i just wrote
[39:09] before i get into john i wrote what he
[39:11] had to
[39:12] say and i was just thinking that's the
[39:16] problem what he was saying is the
[39:17] problem with the world this morning
[39:20] is that people are not who they really
[39:22] are when you get out there in the world
[39:24] what you see is not
[39:26] real
[39:27] people
[39:28] they put on a face they put on a show
[39:31] but behind that show they are not
[39:33] letting you know or you're not seeing
[39:36] who they really are it's all
[39:38] it's a it's a game it's all fabrication
[39:41] what you see out there and he was saying
[39:44] he would rather have people
[39:46] be who they really are
[39:48] than to play either whether it's play
[39:51] christians or play this or play that and
[39:54] i was thinking he was talking in you
[39:56] know i think this one was in 1959 1960
[40:00] and we're in it and we're in a time
[40:03] right now where
[40:05] there everything's reversed right now
[40:07] what the norms were in 1960 and what the
[40:11] norms are in 2022 are totally reversed
[40:15] each other now and it's just a crazy
[40:18] place out there
[40:19] and i always say this i can't say it
[40:21] enough your only hope
[40:23] is in jesus christ and in the word of
[40:25] god anything outside of that you know
[40:27] it's not going to stand on that day the
[40:30] only thing that's going to stand on that
[40:31] day is your character and the word of
[40:33] god that's it that's all you're going to
[40:35] bring there on that day
[40:37] and uh in that relationship
[40:40] you know that's really important you
[40:41] know a lot of times you play around you
[40:43] play with it
[40:45] you don't really take it serious and
[40:47] then you realize that you're coming up
[40:49] short and that's a horrible thing you
[40:51] don't play with it just reach out in
[40:53] faith and grab it and let it change your
[40:56] life and change who you are that's what
[40:58] that's what the world needs this morning
[41:00] that's what we all need but
[41:02] i probably lost my place here i'm
[41:04] drifting but if uh
[41:08] if you would start at about the 34th
[41:11] verse
[41:12] of john the sixth chapter of john
[41:17] and jesus was saying here we all know
[41:19] what this is about you know this is when
[41:21] when a lot of his disciples didn't
[41:23] choose to walk with them anymore
[41:26] and a lot of us
[41:27] you face that in your own lives when you
[41:29] start
[41:30] talking to people about who you are what
[41:33] you believe the message of the hour a
[41:35] lot of those friends you had
[41:37] you don't have anymore
[41:39] you know it's just there's always a
[41:41] choosing time everyone has to choose
[41:45] i'll just read this then jesus said on
[41:47] the verily verily i say unto you moses
[41:50] gave you not the bread from heaven my
[41:52] father gave you the true bread from
[41:53] heaven
[41:54] for the bread that god
[41:57] excuse me for the bread of god is he
[41:59] which cometh down from heaven that
[42:00] giveth life on to the world and that's
[42:02] where we're at this morning the true
[42:04] bread of life
[42:06] is
[42:08] either we're going to possess you or
[42:09] it's not he goes then he said unto them
[42:12] lord evermore give us this bread and
[42:14] jesus said unto them i am the bread of
[42:16] life he that cometh to me shall never
[42:18] hunger he that believeth on me shall
[42:20] never thirst but i say unto you that ye
[42:23] have not seen me
[42:25] excuse me but i say unto you that you
[42:27] also have seen me and believe not and i
[42:30] mean that's just a lot of people are
[42:32] that way you know they follow the
[42:33] miracles and they follow the signs
[42:36] but they still don't believe and all the
[42:38] father giveth me shall come to me and
[42:40] him that cometh to me well i and no one
[42:42] is cast out for i come down from heaven
[42:45] not to do my own will but to do the will
[42:48] of him that sent me and this is the
[42:50] father's will which sent me that of all
[42:53] that which it
[42:54] he hath given me i shall lose nothing
[42:57] but should raise up again at the last
[43:00] day
[43:00] and this is the will of him that sent me
[43:02] that everyone would seeth the son
[43:05] and believeth on him may have
[43:07] everlasting life
[43:09] and i will raise him up in the last day
[43:11] and that's where we're at this morning
[43:13] you know it's not really complicated
[43:17] you know this morning
[43:19] you know you can make him complicated
[43:21] but it's really not complicated your
[43:23] relationship with jesus christ is not
[43:25] complicated
[43:26] you might choose to make it complicated
[43:28] but it really isn't complicated it's
[43:30] just simply believing the word of god
[43:32] and walking in it this morning and we
[43:35] all have to make a choice this morning
[43:36] you know as you see the world i was on
[43:39] my tablet this morning
[43:40] on going
[43:42] you know christian updates on what's
[43:44] going on in ukraine and
[43:46] and i
[43:47] sometimes i have to go to
[43:50] non-uh european or non-uh
[43:55] american news sources to really see
[43:57] what's going on because like i said live
[44:00] the week before or last
[44:02] the news is only letting you see one
[44:04] side and i'm not taken aside here but
[44:06] they're only letting you see one side
[44:09] and that's the point we're getting to in
[44:11] this world
[44:12] there'll come a time where they'll only
[44:14] allow you to have one opinion just like
[44:16] the bible said but you all and us we
[44:19] only want the right opinion and that's
[44:22] what god is showing us in the word of
[44:24] god for the hour that we're living this
[44:26] morning
[44:27] brother david
[44:31] amen let's stand this morning if we
[44:32] could

[1:17:13] and so i trust this morning's service
[1:17:15] will be a benefit for you

[1:17:21] god's judgment amen

[1:17:25] i believe the prophet said we need more
[1:17:27] of those
[1:17:28] uh fire and brimstone type of messages
[1:17:31] amen because that's the other side of
[1:17:34] salvation isn't it it's the other side
[1:17:35] it's the other side of people people who
[1:17:37] have rejected mercy rejected the grace
[1:17:40] of almighty god
[1:17:41] then they have to stand the judgment and
[1:17:44] the wrath of god amen if they do not
[1:17:47] want their sins erased nor forgiven then
[1:17:49] they have to pay
[1:17:51] for their sin
[1:17:52] and i'm he knows each and every one amen
[1:17:55] and so
[1:17:56] amen it's kind of sad amen and so

[1:19:02] down lord and discern the thoughts the

[1:19:09] that you would lord jesus see if there's
[1:19:11] any wicked way in us lord jesus and if

[1:19:52] and an amen
[1:19:54] competitor 3
[1:19:57] verse 4
[1:20:01] down to verse 13. and amen i think we
[1:20:05] finished off pretty much with
[1:20:07] reading this
[1:20:09] wednesday but we want to take this
[1:20:11] and then go on with it
[1:20:13] in a little bit different direction
[1:20:16] second peter 3 and verse 4 says and
[1:20:19] saying well verse 3 i mean knowing this
[1:20:21] first that there shall come in the last
[1:20:23] days scoffers and walking after their
[1:20:25] own lusts
[1:20:27] and saying where is the promise of his
[1:20:29] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[1:20:32] all things continue as they were from
[1:20:33] the beginning of the creation
[1:20:35] for this they are willingly ignorant of
[1:20:37] that by the word of god the heavens were
[1:20:39] of old and the earth standing out of the
[1:20:41] water
[1:20:42] and in the water whereby the world that
[1:20:44] then was being overflowed with water
[1:20:47] perished
[1:20:49] but the heavens and the earth which are
[1:20:51] now by the same word are kept
[1:20:54] in store
[1:20:55] reserved
[1:20:57] unto fire against the day of judgment
[1:21:00] and perdition
[1:21:01] of ungodly men
[1:21:03] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:21:05] thing that one day is with the lord as a
[1:21:06] thousand years and a thousand years as
[1:21:09] one day and the lord is not con
[1:21:11] not slack concerning his promise as men
[1:21:14] some men count slackness but his
[1:21:16] long-suffering to us word not willing
[1:21:18] that any should perish
[1:21:20] but that all should come to repentance
[1:21:23] remember the day of the lord will come
[1:21:24] as the thief in the night in which the
[1:21:26] heavens shall pass away with a great
[1:21:28] noise the elements shall melt with
[1:21:30] fervent heat and earth also in the works
[1:21:32] that are therein shall
[1:21:33] be burned up
[1:21:35] seeing that all these things shall be
[1:21:36] dissolved what manner of persons ought
[1:21:38] need to be in all holy
[1:21:40] conversation and godliness looking for
[1:21:44] and hasting unto the coming of the day
[1:21:45] of god wherein the heavens of heavens
[1:21:48] being on fire shall be dissolved
[1:21:50] the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:21:52] heat nevertheless we
[1:21:54] according to his promise look for a new
[1:21:56] heavens and a new earth
[1:21:58] were indwelled
[1:22:00] with righteousness wherefore beloved
[1:22:02] seeing that he looked for such things be
[1:22:04] diligent that he may be found of him in
[1:22:06] peace and without spot
[1:22:08] and blameless now let's go to our main
[1:22:10] scripture in hebrews 12.
[1:22:13] hebrews 12 and i'll back up after i read
[1:22:15] this one
[1:22:16] and pick out a few thoughts that i
[1:22:18] wanted to share with you amen on
[1:22:22] ii peter the third chapter
[1:22:25] hebrews 12 137 wherefore seeing we also
[1:22:29] are compassed about with so great a
[1:22:30] crowd of witnesses
[1:22:32] let us lay aside every weight in the sin
[1:22:34] which does so easily beset us and let us
[1:22:36] run with patience the race that is set
[1:22:38] before us looking unto jesus
[1:22:41] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:22:44] now i want you to notice two words
[1:22:46] i want you to notice the word endure
[1:22:48] endurance and also patience okay
[1:22:51] so at the end of verse 1 let us run with
[1:22:54] patience the race that is set before us
[1:22:56] looking unto jesus the author and the
[1:22:58] finish of our faith who for the joy that
[1:23:01] was set before him
[1:23:02] endured
[1:23:04] the cross despising the shame and is set
[1:23:07] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:23:08] god
[1:23:09] for consider him that endured such
[1:23:12] contradiction of sinners against himself
[1:23:15] least ye be wearied and faint in your
[1:23:16] minds
[1:23:18] for ye have not ye have not yet resisted
[1:23:20] unto blood striving against sin
[1:23:22] and have you forgotten the exhortation
[1:23:24] which speaketh unto you as children my
[1:23:26] son despise thou not the chastening of
[1:23:28] the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked
[1:23:31] of
[1:23:31] him
[1:23:32] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:23:34] us and scorches every son whom we
[1:23:35] receive it and if you endure chastening
[1:23:38] god dealeth with you as with sons
[1:23:40] for what son
[1:23:42] is he whom the father chasteneth not but
[1:23:44] if he be without chastisement wherefore
[1:23:47] all our partakers and are you bastards
[1:23:48] not sons may god add his blessings to
[1:23:51] the reading of the word you can be
[1:23:52] seated this morning
[1:23:55] amen
[1:23:57] i want to start out by just
[1:24:01] um looking at verse three of chapter
[1:24:04] three of second peter for a minute it
[1:24:06] says you know that knowing this that the
[1:24:08] they'll come in the last days coffers
[1:24:10] and walking after us
[1:24:13] amen and so
[1:24:15] that of course describes that everybody
[1:24:18] is going to kind of pretty much
[1:24:20] do whatever they desire to do isn't that
[1:24:23] right
[1:24:24] amen after their own lust because in
[1:24:26] their minds
[1:24:28] amen in their minds they don't really
[1:24:31] think that he's coming
[1:24:34] right
[1:24:35] they don't really think that it is
[1:24:38] coming
[1:24:38] you know
[1:24:41] and
[1:24:42] [Music]
[1:24:43] i've you know and i just want to say
[1:24:45] that i feel like in my heart
[1:24:48] there's something about a believer
[1:24:51] something about a christian
[1:24:52] and we want to speak on this morning we
[1:24:54] want to talk about
[1:24:56] a long-range vision all right
[1:24:59] faith being a long-range vision looking
[1:25:02] way ahead looking at what's coming right
[1:25:05] they don't think it's going to come so
[1:25:07] they live however they want to
[1:25:10] amen
[1:25:12] but let me ask you this do you think
[1:25:14] tomorrow will come
[1:25:20] a better question yet
[1:25:22] did today
[1:25:24] come it came didn't it
[1:25:28] and just as sure as yesterday we would
[1:25:31] have said you know i wonder if tomorrow
[1:25:32] is coming now it's here
[1:25:35] amen
[1:25:36] i mean that's how sure
[1:25:39] that it is that jesus christ is going to
[1:25:42] return
[1:25:44] amen the time will come
[1:25:47] when time will be no more
[1:25:50] how many know we're running out of time
[1:25:54] we're running out of time
[1:25:57] just as sure as we're standing here one
[1:25:59] day we'll not be here
[1:26:01] just as sure
[1:26:03] as we're here this morning there'll be a
[1:26:05] judgment day that comes
[1:26:07] is that right
[1:26:09] and i'll tell you what you really have
[1:26:11] to keep your eyes
[1:26:13] towards the end
[1:26:16] amen
[1:26:16] [Applause]
[1:26:19] amen
[1:26:23] and so they say they think that he's not
[1:26:25] going to come but peter's saying here
[1:26:28] he says you know the old world
[1:26:31] it overflowed with water it was
[1:26:33] destroyed
[1:26:35] and peter begins to say and just as sure
[1:26:37] as the old world was destroyed
[1:26:39] that's how sure that this present world
[1:26:42] is reserved it has a reservation
[1:26:47] by the word of god this is sure as god's
[1:26:50] word is true
[1:26:52] amen this world is reserved for fire
[1:26:57] even the heavens are going to be on fire
[1:27:01] the earth is going to be on fire
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:07] and
[1:27:08] so this morning we want to talk a little
[1:27:10] bit with the help of the lord about
[1:27:12] endurance
[1:27:14] imminent who and of course endurance and
[1:27:16] patience runs hand in hand
[1:27:19] amen
[1:27:21] and you know as we get older i mean as
[1:27:24] we get older
[1:27:26] you have and i have this morning a real
[1:27:28] longing a real desire
[1:27:30] for something that endures
[1:27:34] right
[1:27:35] something that endures
[1:27:38] and what we love so much about god is
[1:27:41] that
[1:27:42] he don't never change
[1:27:45] we know that here we have no continuing
[1:27:48] city
[1:27:50] right
[1:27:51] we have nothing there is nothing here
[1:27:53] that continues everything changes
[1:27:56] continuously changes
[1:28:01] you would think that if we had a when
[1:28:03] you have a good thing you want to just
[1:28:05] try to keep it that way don't you
[1:28:07] but it doesn't stay that way
[1:28:09] amen
[1:28:11] just like being young well
[1:28:13] well it ain't too many turns of the sun
[1:28:15] and things change
[1:28:17] amen i like what brother brian said
[1:28:19] about you know your mind says no i can
[1:28:21] do this yet i can do it but the body
[1:28:23] says no you can't
[1:28:26] i know what he's talking about
[1:28:29] amen and if you you can you can really
[1:28:32] push it but you pay for it
[1:28:34] and after a while the penalty becomes
[1:28:36] worse
[1:28:37] it's just uh you don't want to pay the
[1:28:39] penalty for it
[1:28:43] amen but it just doesn't stay the same
[1:28:45] nothing stays the same except
[1:28:48] the word of god i mean god's word
[1:28:52] endureth forever
[1:28:55] it never changes
[1:28:58] even jesus said heaven and earth they're
[1:29:00] gonna pass away but my word it'll never
[1:29:03] pass away
[1:29:05] god's word is the only thing that
[1:29:07] endures
[1:29:10] and a christian has a desire for
[1:29:12] something that endures
[1:29:17] amen
[1:29:19] praise the lord abraham how many knows
[1:29:21] abraham
[1:29:23] desired a city
[1:29:26] that was built by god they desired a
[1:29:28] better country
[1:29:31] am i right
[1:29:31] [Applause]
[1:29:33] he so journeyed in a strange land
[1:29:36] looking for a city who's builder and
[1:29:38] maker with god let me tell you something
[1:29:40] this world is becoming more strange
[1:29:43] all the time
[1:29:45] this is a weird place folks
[1:29:48] this is a strange
[1:29:50] place amen and it's become more strange
[1:29:54] to the christian
[1:29:56] nothing's normal anymore is it
[1:30:00] you go to walmart go anywhere and you
[1:30:02] see a woman with a skirt and so forth
[1:30:04] dressed like a human being was like wow
[1:30:06] look at there
[1:30:08] you almost want to say praise the lord
[1:30:11] got to be a christian wear a skirt right
[1:30:14] right and so to everybody else look at
[1:30:17] what they're you know one thing they
[1:30:18] don't they don't say the same the evil
[1:30:20] people they don't say the same
[1:30:22] and you realize folks that those
[1:30:25] everybody out there they're people just
[1:30:27] like you are but it's a spirit that
[1:30:29] possesses something
[1:30:32] amen praise the lord
[1:30:36] endurance we're looking for things that
[1:30:39] endure
[1:30:40] if you all remember brother brahm's life
[1:30:43] story
[1:30:45] how he talked about his dad
[1:30:47] did he was so tough
[1:30:49] how strong he was his shirt would get
[1:30:51] sunburned to the back and they'd have to
[1:30:53] peel it off
[1:30:54] and how he could take 900 pound logs and
[1:30:56] load 900 pound logs and so forth he says
[1:30:58] my daddy will never die died at 52.
[1:31:02] seeing a big old oak tree there in the
[1:31:03] front yard man that thing will last
[1:31:05] forever it wasn't no time hello and that
[1:31:08] thing was nothing but a spring
[1:31:10] huh no continuing city
[1:31:13] and when i think about it even the
[1:31:15] probably god look how long he's been
[1:31:16] gone
[1:31:18] let me tell you something he is very
[1:31:20] glad for the stand that he took while he
[1:31:22] was here
[1:31:24] because here we have no contain life is
[1:31:26] short here
[1:31:28] amen but the christian desire something
[1:31:31] that endures
[1:31:33] endures forever even jesus said labor
[1:31:35] not from the meat that perishes
[1:31:39] but labor for the meat that endureth
[1:31:44] amen
[1:31:46] that's what we're eating this morning
[1:31:49] the meat that endureth
[1:31:51] i'm not reading something out of a
[1:31:53] man-made cookbook or how to stay young
[1:31:56] this is the word of god it's the only
[1:31:58] thing that endures forever
[1:32:00] and he believes that if you are going to
[1:32:02] endure forever you're going to have to
[1:32:04] be part of this right here
[1:32:08] amen how many believes that
[1:32:11] oh my
[1:32:16] and then before i go a little further
[1:32:18] it says there that
[1:32:21] he says you know don't be ignorant with
[1:32:24] the lord one day is a thousand years and
[1:32:26] a thousand years is one day
[1:32:28] and the lord's not not slack concerning
[1:32:30] his pop a promise but notice
[1:32:33] the other word that i like to bring into
[1:32:35] this is
[1:32:36] that one of the fruits of the spirit is
[1:32:38] long suffering right
[1:32:41] i mean i was a christian has to suffer
[1:32:43] along
[1:32:45] he has to be patient
[1:32:48] he has to endure
[1:32:51] amen
[1:32:56] it's part of the christian's makeup it's
[1:32:59] part of who we are because we're living
[1:33:01] in a world brothers and sisters where
[1:33:04] people haven't got what it takes
[1:33:07] don't have that endurance on the inside
[1:33:10] of them
[1:33:11] huh
[1:33:13] remember jesus went talking when he was
[1:33:15] talking about the sword that went forth
[1:33:16] the soul and so forth in all the
[1:33:18] different places that the seed fell
[1:33:22] amen
[1:33:24] and he said in verse 20 of chapter 13 of
[1:33:26] matthew he says but he that receiveth
[1:33:27] the seed into the stony places
[1:33:34] the stoning place is the same as he
[1:33:35] which heareth the word and anoi with joy
[1:33:37] receiveth it yet he has not rooted
[1:33:40] himself
[1:33:41] to earth
[1:33:43] for a while
[1:33:46] amen
[1:33:47] i don't know about you but i don't want
[1:33:49] to just endure or do it for a while
[1:33:54] amen don't you like people who stick it
[1:33:56] out
[1:33:57] people who go the distance
[1:34:01] amen
[1:34:02] one place the bible says that he that
[1:34:04] endureth
[1:34:05] unto the end
[1:34:07] he shall be saved
[1:34:09] amen
[1:34:11] i believe how many believes it takes
[1:34:12] gonna take endurance
[1:34:15] we're living in a world folks where
[1:34:17] we're going to have to endure this
[1:34:19] layout of ch
[1:34:22] we're living in ireland i felt like this
[1:34:23] was perhaps something the lord was
[1:34:25] wanting to tell us and that is that
[1:34:27] we're going to have to be a little more
[1:34:29] patient
[1:34:31] we're going to have to endure
[1:34:33] all the way to the end
[1:34:35] and that's truly what we're doing now
[1:34:37] the reason that part of the reason i
[1:34:38] read that about the long suffering of
[1:34:40] christ and amen and the days of noah
[1:34:43] there was you know there's a long
[1:34:44] suffering period not that right and even
[1:34:47] today god is long-suffering it says god
[1:34:50] is long-suffering
[1:34:52] not willing that any should perish
[1:34:56] amen
[1:34:58] god is waiting long
[1:35:00] even the probably god thought that you
[1:35:02] know the millennium would have been here
[1:35:05] by 1977.
[1:35:10] well i'm glad it wasn't
[1:35:12] where would you be some of us weren't
[1:35:15] born in 77 probably
[1:35:17] huh
[1:35:19] let alone born again
[1:35:21] but god is long suffering he's long
[1:35:24] suffering and how many know that the
[1:35:26] bible says there in first corinthians 13
[1:35:28] he says you know charity suffereth long
[1:35:31] and is kind
[1:35:33] amen and charity also endures all things
[1:35:40] i mean there's endurance with love
[1:35:43] that's what god is god is love and he
[1:35:45] has got
[1:35:46] long suffering he's got endured waiting
[1:35:49] for people to come to christ
[1:35:51] he's not willing that any should perish
[1:35:55] amen and you and i are running a race
[1:35:57] every human being has had to run that
[1:35:59] race
[1:36:00] we've all had to endure
[1:36:03] keep on going
[1:36:05] keep it on keep an eye on
[1:36:08] how many knows you take something in
[1:36:10] there
[1:36:12] to help you to keep on going on
[1:36:14] through all the trials and through
[1:36:16] everything that comes along
[1:36:19] amen
[1:36:22] and we desire i hope you are desiring
[1:36:25] because i'm getting less at home here
[1:36:27] than ever
[1:36:28] amen
[1:36:29] i'm longing for i'm aren't you longing
[1:36:31] for something that's eternal
[1:36:34] amen that's exactly right
[1:36:38] now notice another scripture if you will
[1:36:42] that paul was talking in hebrews the
[1:36:44] 10th chapter
[1:36:46] he said verse 34
[1:36:48] for you had compassion on me and the
[1:36:51] things that he needed so far
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:36:54] in my bonds and took joyfully the
[1:36:55] spoiling of your goods knowing
[1:36:58] in yourselves
[1:36:59] that you have that you have in heaven a
[1:37:02] better and an enduring
[1:37:05] substance
[1:37:07] cast now that way therefore your
[1:37:09] confidence which has great recompense of
[1:37:11] reward
[1:37:13] for ye of need of patience
[1:37:16] amen notice how he talks about he talks
[1:37:19] about endurance talks about patience how
[1:37:21] many believe we have need of patience
[1:37:24] people are not a patient anymore
[1:37:27] and no doubt a lot of us that have had
[1:37:30] some experience
[1:37:31] of how that the supply chain is
[1:37:33] supposedly slowed down now
[1:37:36] amen and some things you can't get near
[1:37:39] as quick as what you could
[1:37:42] and boy i'll tell you what isn't that
[1:37:44] just almost upsetting
[1:37:46] why because we got no patience we don't
[1:37:48] know what patience is anything you want
[1:37:50] you can go get almost at any given time
[1:37:54] amen
[1:37:56] amen we have to be patient
[1:38:00] that after you have done the will of god
[1:38:02] you might receive the promise
[1:38:04] for yet a little while paul having the
[1:38:07] same mentality
[1:38:09] yet a little while and he that shall
[1:38:11] come will come he's going to be here one
[1:38:13] of these days
[1:38:15] amen
[1:38:16] and will not tarry for now the judge
[1:38:18] shall live by faith but if any man draw
[1:38:20] back and that's what's happening
[1:38:23] amen people are falling away
[1:38:25] [Applause]
[1:38:27] people are backsliding
[1:38:34] and isn't that what the prophet seen at
[1:38:36] the very end when he seen a picture of
[1:38:38] the preview of the bride
[1:38:41] now right brother brad you seen the hand
[1:38:42] there the last the few of those ladies
[1:38:45] at the very end begin to veer off
[1:38:49] and that right to get back in line get
[1:38:50] back in line
[1:38:53] amen keep steady keep steady why because
[1:38:56] we're living in an age where men people
[1:38:58] are just drunk with pledges
[1:39:00] of the world
[1:39:02] drunk with riches
[1:39:04] drunk with money
[1:39:07] drunk with it
[1:39:09] amen
[1:39:11] all kinds of things for distractions
[1:39:14] to keep you distracted to get you
[1:39:16] distracted get you off the path
[1:39:19] amen
[1:39:22] oh my
[1:39:23] he says and if any man draw back my soul
[1:39:26] shall have no pleasure in him
[1:39:28] but we are not of them that draw back
[1:39:30] unto perdition but of them that believe
[1:39:32] unto the saving of the soul just like
[1:39:34] jesus that we're not part of those who
[1:39:36] endure for a little while and amen that
[1:39:39] go by the wayside
[1:39:41] when trials and tribulation comes off
[1:39:44] the fall
[1:39:46] amen
[1:39:49] amen endurance
[1:39:51] endurance in this lukewarm age let me
[1:39:54] know it's lukewarmness all around us
[1:39:58] layout asea
[1:40:00] riches and cares of life
[1:40:02] amen
[1:40:03] things that you got to endure
[1:40:06] endurance and have to have pain
[1:40:09] patience
[1:40:10] have to be patient in it
[1:40:13] in hebrews 6
[1:40:16] and uh
[1:40:18] verse 11 and we desire that every one of
[1:40:20] you to show the same diligence of full
[1:40:22] assurance of hope
[1:40:24] unto the end that ye be not slothful
[1:40:27] but followers of them who through faith
[1:40:30] and patience inherit the promises
[1:40:34] amen
[1:40:35] just like abraham how many knows abraham
[1:40:37] had to wait for 25 years
[1:40:42] and you know what it wasn't
[1:40:45] he didn't have to wait
[1:40:46] from 25 to 50
[1:40:49] right that might have been an easy way
[1:40:52] or even for him from
[1:40:54] 50 to 75
[1:40:57] now that was a little harder because
[1:40:59] sarah was already
[1:41:01] not able to have any more children
[1:41:02] anymore by the time god and they were
[1:41:04] calling to visit him
[1:41:06] but he was about 75 and sarah was about
[1:41:08] 65 and then god came and says i'm going
[1:41:10] to give you all a baby
[1:41:13] huh and then he went in from 75 to 85 90
[1:41:17] years old
[1:41:19] am i right
[1:41:20] wait for all that time it had to be it
[1:41:23] had to be a thing of endurance well just
[1:41:25] keep waiting
[1:41:28] a lot of time we expect our prayers to
[1:41:29] be answered instantly
[1:41:32] when you get prayed for it you believe
[1:41:34] it you hang on to it and you believe it
[1:41:36] with all of your heart
[1:41:37] remember john ryan he came back and he
[1:41:39] said you know i didn't get healed
[1:41:41] brother god says you believe me to be a
[1:41:42] prayer prophet you believe god healed
[1:41:44] you he says well then keep believing
[1:41:46] that kate confessed to it he had to be
[1:41:48] told twice to hang on to him
[1:41:51] after the second time he kept hanging on
[1:41:53] to it
[1:41:54] he told a lot
[1:41:55] a lot of people he said i praise god i'm
[1:41:58] healed i can see
[1:42:00] praise god i'm healed he was wrong on
[1:42:02] his back but he couldn't see many times
[1:42:03] he wasn't he had to walk away and still
[1:42:05] be blind
[1:42:07] but one time
[1:42:09] the time came
[1:42:12] when he was in that barbershop isn't
[1:42:14] that right
[1:42:15] man had a razor black and he we're
[1:42:17] making fun of him
[1:42:19] this is the guy he's just the guy he's
[1:42:20] going around everywhere talking about
[1:42:22] being able to see and he's still buying
[1:42:23] his bat
[1:42:26] they had a little laugh no doubt
[1:42:28] huh he said that's right praise god i'm
[1:42:31] healed and just about that time his eyes
[1:42:33] popped open
[1:42:36] hello i don't care he probably had half
[1:42:38] his hair cut he didn't care how he
[1:42:39] looked he's jumping up jump up right up
[1:42:44] praise the lord that's probably god
[1:42:45] putting the barber right running behind
[1:42:47] him with a shaver in the raider and he
[1:42:49] was all
[1:42:50] looking funny here you know come on back
[1:42:52] here
[1:42:54] facebook why because he had endured
[1:42:57] patience wait for god didn't daniel pray
[1:43:00] for pray for something and he took 25
[1:43:03] days for the angels finally come and
[1:43:04] answer his prayer
[1:43:07] imagine an angel having from what i
[1:43:09] understand you know and i don't know
[1:43:10] exactly just what they were battled but
[1:43:12] they were battling uh
[1:43:14] other spiritual powers to try to get to
[1:43:16] him
[1:43:19] how many believe we need patience
[1:43:22] folks we need patience evening light
[1:43:24] tabernacle you need patience
[1:43:28] people need patience endurance
[1:43:32] amen
[1:43:35] things just don't do more because god
[1:43:37] isn't in it
[1:43:39] how many believes you need god in it if
[1:43:41] you're going to endure
[1:43:43] amen
[1:43:44] that's right look he says
[1:43:46] be followers of them who threaten
[1:43:48] through faith and patience inherit the
[1:43:51] promises look to abraham look at how he
[1:43:54] waited and he had to be patient
[1:43:58] i like noah's example
[1:44:01] i mean those
[1:44:02] got a message and he was told that god
[1:44:04] is going to destroy to destroy the world
[1:44:06] and he preached for
[1:44:08] 120 years
[1:44:10] huh
[1:44:11] 120 years
[1:44:15] ma
[1:44:18] here we are folks we're up
[1:44:21] we're up close to the 75
[1:44:23] 80 year mark already
[1:44:25] since the prophet came on the scene and
[1:44:27] declared to the judgment of the world
[1:44:29] and the destruction of the world and so
[1:44:30] forth
[1:44:31] a long time
[1:44:33] amen
[1:44:35] so you have to endure
[1:44:36] noah preacher for 120 years look at how
[1:44:39] long he had to wait how long he had to
[1:44:41] endure all the scoffers
[1:44:46] never
[1:44:46] folks you know i don't know about you
[1:44:48] but the scoffers don't do much to
[1:44:50] deflect me how about you
[1:44:52] it don't matter how much they don't
[1:44:54] think there's a god and we come from
[1:44:56] monkeys and there's no judgment and all
[1:44:58] of that
[1:44:59] huh
[1:45:01] folks i'm telling you just like brother
[1:45:03] brown says you can't tell what's being
[1:45:05] people a lot of times
[1:45:07] you know we just had another mass
[1:45:08] shooting by some teenager that
[1:45:10] recorded his rampage
[1:45:13] huh
[1:45:14] no doubt he lived with mom dad neighbors
[1:45:16] and everybody but people did not see
[1:45:18] that in him
[1:45:19] huh
[1:45:20] perhaps didn't see that there's that
[1:45:22] potential and people are just you never
[1:45:24] know
[1:45:25] amen but aren't you glad for christians
[1:45:27] that are what they are be what you're
[1:45:30] supposed to be amen that's a christian
[1:45:32] amen
[1:45:33] praise the lord
[1:45:34] so in order brother and sister to have
[1:45:37] some kind of endurance you have to be
[1:45:39] born how many says to win at your birth
[1:45:42] people that are not born again
[1:45:44] they're about as unstable as they come
[1:45:47] that's why the world is in the condition
[1:45:49] that it's in
[1:45:52] now thinking of how christ would feel
[1:45:54] about the world and the condition that
[1:45:56] it's in now
[1:45:58] because there was times when jesus would
[1:46:00] you know tell that fox you know and so
[1:46:02] forth he kind of make a joke perhaps and
[1:46:04] then there's other times when jesus when
[1:46:06] he would sit on the side of a hill and
[1:46:08] then he said he wept
[1:46:11] he said oh jerusalem jerusalem i would
[1:46:13] have hovered you but you would not
[1:46:16] what about today let me tell you
[1:46:18] something that this world is in a very
[1:46:21] sad condition
[1:46:25] it's very sad to see
[1:46:27] oh my
[1:46:30] as you
[1:46:31] endure
[1:46:32] as you are
[1:46:34] like lot how many knows that lot was
[1:46:37] vexed
[1:46:38] by the conditions of sodom
[1:46:41] it says it vex his right to soul
[1:46:44] i mean that's the way that we feel
[1:46:46] that's the way we feel sometimes
[1:46:47] whenever you see two lesbians or
[1:46:49] homosexuals walking out that vexes your
[1:46:52] souls like oh
[1:46:56] how could this be
[1:46:58] or the hairdos people have the tattoos
[1:47:02] it matches you you realize that the
[1:47:04] precious soul there but it's absolutely
[1:47:06] taken over by spirit
[1:47:08] they need the freedom of god they need
[1:47:10] god more than anything else in the world
[1:47:13] but it vexes you it's a vexation
[1:47:17] and i believe god still feels i believe
[1:47:19] god feels the way about this generation
[1:47:22] the way that he did
[1:47:24] with noah's generation
[1:47:27] how did he feel
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:30] he was grieved
[1:47:32] he was grieved
[1:47:35] and he says it repenteth me that i have
[1:47:37] made man
[1:47:41] he was very grieved with the way that
[1:47:43] humanity went
[1:47:45] and that's the way we feel this morning
[1:47:46] we are grieved with the way that
[1:47:49] humanity is gone
[1:47:53] you know in the bible talks paul talked
[1:47:55] about it as obeying all the laws of the
[1:47:57] land and so forth because they are
[1:48:00] policemen and they're there to make sure
[1:48:02] that you do that which is good
[1:48:06] that which is right and i thought you
[1:48:07] know that that's be a good that's a good
[1:48:09] law to follow is somebody that's
[1:48:11] enforcing good and right
[1:48:14] but now
[1:48:15] we have laws
[1:48:17] and our laws and so forth that are
[1:48:19] making right wrong and wrong right
[1:48:22] and if you don't believe in that wrong
[1:48:24] well they were going to persecute you
[1:48:26] that's where we're at in a terrible
[1:48:28] place
[1:48:30] amen and it's only people listen
[1:48:34] the world don't realize i hope the world
[1:48:37] hears this but you don't realize that
[1:48:39] the only reason that you're still here
[1:48:42] is because of god's long suffering for
[1:48:44] you
[1:48:46] i asked myself many times sitting out on
[1:48:48] my farm what am i still doing here
[1:48:53] what are we still doing here
[1:48:57] it's time for us to leave this place
[1:49:00] and how many believes we're going to
[1:49:01] leave in the moment and it's going to be
[1:49:03] a secret catching away folks
[1:49:05] it's going to be it's going to come in
[1:49:07] the time the world doesn't expect it
[1:49:10] amen and he says if you're not aware but
[1:49:12] paul said that day is not going to take
[1:49:14] you on unaware because you're not of the
[1:49:16] night and you're not asleep like they
[1:49:18] are
[1:49:19] we're going to be ready i mean we're
[1:49:20] going to be ready and waiting for the
[1:49:23] coming of the lord
[1:49:25] and when he comes we're going to be just
[1:49:26] taken out of here
[1:49:29] amen
[1:49:31] and the world will say well they just
[1:49:33] you know they were a little bit
[1:49:35] funny anyway
[1:49:37] they were in a cult they followed some
[1:49:39] man
[1:49:41] all kinds of things they'll say
[1:49:43] but it's all going to go amen
[1:49:46] now from what i understand people still
[1:49:47] preach still have a service it'll runs
[1:49:50] perhaps smooth for a while yet
[1:49:52] amen
[1:49:53] but when them two prophets come to
[1:49:55] israel hello when them two prophets come
[1:49:57] to israel we know that they'll shut up
[1:49:59] the skies
[1:50:01] the heavens that don't reign
[1:50:03] they have the power to bring curses and
[1:50:05] everything else upon the earth
[1:50:07] you talk about peril
[1:50:09] in that tribulation
[1:50:11] period
[1:50:12] it'll sure be perilous
[1:50:15] but it's the patience of almighty god
[1:50:18] amen how many knows god god is a god of
[1:50:20] patience
[1:50:22] amen okay second peter i wanted to read
[1:50:25] you this
[1:50:44] first peter not not second peter first
[1:50:46] peter one if you want with me let's
[1:50:48] start with
[1:50:50] verse 22 seeing you have purified your
[1:50:54] souls in obeying the truth through the
[1:50:55] spirit
[1:50:56] unto unfraimed love of the brethren
[1:51:00] see that you love one another with a
[1:51:02] pure heart fervently
[1:51:06] being born again not of corruptable seed
[1:51:09] but of incorruptible
[1:51:12] by the word of god how many knows when
[1:51:15] you're born by the word of god it
[1:51:17] changes your whole desire system it
[1:51:20] gives you a complete new outlook
[1:51:23] amen
[1:51:24] your
[1:51:25] high
[1:51:26] the word of god i want to say that so
[1:51:28] that you get that which liveth and
[1:51:30] abideth
[1:51:32] forever
[1:51:33] praise the lord i'm just glad that you
[1:51:35] know that you live eternally
[1:51:38] if you're born by the word of god you
[1:51:40] will never pass away you will never come
[1:51:43] to naught for all flesh peter saying
[1:51:45] here for all flesh is as grass the glory
[1:51:49] of man as the flower of grass the grass
[1:51:52] withereth and the flower thereof falleth
[1:51:55] away
[1:51:56] amen
[1:51:59] amen but the word of the lord
[1:52:02] endureth
[1:52:04] forever
[1:52:05] it'll never change
[1:52:08] and this is the word which by the gospel
[1:52:10] is preached
[1:52:11] unto
[1:52:13] you
[1:52:14] amen
[1:52:15] so in order for us to be
[1:52:18] be able to endure
[1:52:20] you have to be born by
[1:52:23] the word of
[1:52:25] god
[1:52:28] let's talk about patience for a little
[1:52:29] bit
[1:52:31] james if you will let's go to james
[1:52:41] can i mention one more thing before we
[1:52:43] we go into patience
[1:52:46] i want to just mention hebrews 12 where
[1:52:48] it talks about
[1:52:50] the lord said if you endure
[1:52:52] chastisement am i right
[1:52:54] because sometimes the lord correcting us
[1:52:56] and so forth we have to endure that if
[1:52:58] you can't endure that then you're not
[1:53:01] god's child
[1:53:02] it takes
[1:53:03] you know
[1:53:04] endurance
[1:53:06] and then
[1:53:07] it takes patience to be able to go
[1:53:09] through things

[1:56:41] do just be patient
[1:56:44] let me ask you this question
[1:56:47] what
[1:56:48] what one hope is there for this world
[1:56:55] there's only one hope the prophet said
[1:56:59] and he said the coming of the lord jesus
[1:57:01] christ is the only hope there is
[1:57:08] that's the only hope everything else is
[1:57:10] going to be cannon fire destruction
[1:57:13] destroyed
[1:57:15] that's not hope
[1:57:16] right to stay here is not hope the only
[1:57:19] hope that you and i have is the coming
[1:57:21] of the lord and to be caught up together
[1:57:23] to meet the lord in the air so shall we
[1:57:25] ever be with him amen that's the only
[1:57:27] hope but in it we have to be
[1:57:30] patient i believe as christians we have
[1:57:32] to be patient
[1:57:35] patient
[1:57:36] long suffering how many does we got to
[1:57:38] be long-suffering one with another
[1:57:42] i've lived long enough to know this
[1:57:45] that if you love somebody man you will
[1:57:48] cover a multitude of sins
[1:57:51] man you will have long suffering for a
[1:57:53] person
[1:57:55] amen if you've got love
[1:57:58] but i'll tell you what i've known people
[1:58:00] that don't have love they claim they
[1:58:02] have love
[1:58:03] but they don't have any patience for you
[1:58:05] whatsoever
[1:58:06] huh
[1:58:08] no forgiveness
[1:58:10] that's how you know whether somebody
[1:58:12] loves you or not if they're willing to
[1:58:13] be long-suffering and gentle with you
[1:58:15] forgiving

[1:58:43] patient
[1:58:45] one place that talks about the patience
[1:58:47] of god
[1:58:50] i'm going to come
[1:58:52] back to this but i want to read this
[1:58:53] right quick revelations 1 9 it says i
[1:58:56] john also am your brother and companion
[1:58:59] in tribulation and in the kingdom
[1:59:02] and patience

[1:59:08] huh isn't that what uh
[1:59:10] uh john i mean uh paul said in hebrews
[1:59:13] 12
[1:59:14] run this race with patience
[1:59:18] looking unto jesus the author and the
[1:59:21] feature of our faith
[1:59:23] look at how patient he was with those
[1:59:25] sinners patient with those scribes and
[1:59:28] the pharisees patience when they were
[1:59:29] beating him
[1:59:31] patience when they were putting the
[1:59:32] stripes on his back
[1:59:35] huh
[1:59:37] he endured it says that jesus endured
[1:59:40] the cross he endured the hardships
[1:59:45] and then he says look at him at the end
[1:59:47] now he's at the right hand of god
[1:59:49] exalted above every name name above
[1:59:50] every name that there is
[1:59:52] amen
[1:59:54] he says look to him for your example of
[1:59:57] patience and endurance you look to
[2:00:00] christ
[2:00:01] and what he did
[2:00:03] amen

[2:00:08] is the husband that waiteth for the
[2:00:10] precious fruit of the earth
[2:00:13] and has long
[2:00:14] patience for it

[2:00:40] that's what they said
[2:00:42] it straws now it's almost here
[2:00:48] cannot presume for just a minute they
[2:00:50] probably presumed that the roman
[2:00:52] government would be the last government
[2:00:55] they didn't they expected the lord to
[2:00:57] come back any time
[2:00:59] they really were
[2:01:02] that was their expectation
[2:01:06] amen
[2:01:08] you say well how do you know he's coming
[2:01:10] now well we've had a prophet come to say
[2:01:12] this is it

[2:01:33] cause you the backslider or to be
[2:01:35] deterred this is the hour where you have
[2:01:38] to be
[2:01:39] patient
[2:01:42] established steadfast
[2:01:45] looking for the coming of the lord
[2:01:48] grudge not against one another brethren
[2:01:50] least he be condemned behold the judge
[2:01:52] standeth before the door
[2:01:54] take my brethren the prophets who have
[2:01:56] spoken in the name of the lord
[2:01:58] for an example of suffering affliction
[2:02:02] and of patience
[2:02:05] behold we count them
[2:02:07] happy
[2:02:08] which
[2:02:09] endure
[2:02:12] you have heard of the patience of job
[2:02:14] amen
[2:02:16] but in job look at how he endured look
[2:02:18] at the patience that he had look at his
[2:02:21] endurance
[2:02:24] i wanted to ask siri or or somehow find
[2:02:27] out just how long job was on the action
[2:02:29] i wonder how long he was in that
[2:02:31] condition
[2:02:32] maybe somebody can come up with that for
[2:02:34] me and have seen the end of the lord
[2:02:37] amen the end of the lord
[2:02:39] and that the lord is very pitiful and of
[2:02:43] tender mercy

[2:02:49] the look
[2:02:50] look at all the examples that we have of
[2:02:52] patience
[2:02:54] of being patient
[2:02:56] and of enduring
[2:02:58] and keeping on keeping on
[2:03:01] because how many know sometimes your
[2:03:02] flesh don't feel like it
[2:03:05] sometimes you don't feel like praying
[2:03:09] sometimes you don't feel like going to
[2:03:10] church
[2:03:12] hey man that's just goes to show you you
[2:03:13] need to get on your prayer bones and say
[2:03:15] god

[2:03:18] not this world is not my home i'm just a
[2:03:20] passing through my treasures are laid up
[2:03:23] somewhere beyond the blue
[2:03:25] everything around here is temporal
[2:03:28] everything is temporary and i'm looking
[2:03:31] for a city i'm looking for something
[2:03:33] that is eternal amen i already have
[2:03:36] eternal life
[2:03:37] but let me tell you what folks this
[2:03:39] cesspool this pet house
[2:03:43] is not my home
[2:03:46] it's not your home we're looking for a
[2:03:48] better place we desire like abraham a
[2:03:51] better a better land
[2:03:54] amen how many is doing that how many
[2:03:56] knows we need patience we need patience
[2:03:58] we need endurance

[2:04:03] more more endurance brother violet
[2:04:06] amen praise the lord
[2:04:08] god bless you
[2:04:10] like i said
[2:04:11] israel was an example of what you don't
[2:04:13] want to be
[2:04:15] they were impatient
[2:04:17] amen
[2:04:18] they were short
[2:04:21] dathan and korra they couldn't wait for
[2:04:23] god to do something
[2:04:25] let me know just wait for god to do it
[2:04:28] but they couldn't wait israel couldn't
[2:04:30] wait for god to supply food for him
[2:04:32] couldn't wait for some supply water for
[2:04:34] him if they'd have just waited i mean
[2:04:36] that would have made it way for him god
[2:04:38] would have given him what he'd give he
[2:04:39] would have given food he would have made
[2:04:40] the way
[2:04:42] but god was trying them
[2:04:44] he was testing them
[2:04:47] did they pass the test
[2:04:50] no
[2:04:51] the bible says if you are chastised if
[2:04:54] you're corrected and you can't
[2:04:56] take that correction that you're a
[2:04:58] bastard and not a son
[2:05:00] because a real son and daughter of god
[2:05:01] they can take the chastisement that
[2:05:03] comes
[2:05:04] amen that god gives
[2:05:07] amen
[2:05:08] plays the lord so i'll tell you what
[2:05:10] this morning my heart
[2:05:12] my heart just goes out
[2:05:14] amen because we realize that
[2:05:16] the world is in a real bad condition
[2:05:18] folks
[2:05:20] and you almost feel like jesus you know
[2:05:22] you feel like like perhaps jesus felt
[2:05:24] and that is just to sit on a hillside
[2:05:27] somewhere and weep say god you know look
[2:05:29] at what you did
[2:05:32] all day long he stretched out his hands
[2:05:34] but they would not
[2:05:36] not your destruction now your desolation
[2:05:38] comes upon you
[2:05:41] amen but thank god god knows those that
[2:05:43] are his
[2:05:46] amen god bless you this morning stand
[2:05:49] with me musicians if you'll come
[2:05:53] all i can tell you this morning is
[2:05:55] keeping worrying keep pressing on
[2:05:58] amen
[2:05:59] one of these days just as sure just as
[2:06:02] sure
[2:06:03] as if the clock keeps ticking
[2:06:06] tomorrow morning that alarm's going to
[2:06:07] go off it's going to be
[2:06:09] monday
[2:06:10] right
[2:06:11] you have to go back to work
[2:06:13] just that's how sure it is that one of
[2:06:15] these days
[2:06:17] jesus is going to come in the clouds of
[2:06:19] heaven and he's going to catch his
[2:06:20] little bride away and be gone amen and
[2:06:23] so shall we ever be with the lord
[2:06:26] that is our hope
[2:06:27] amen let's bow our heads
[2:06:32] why don't you ask yourself if you don't
[2:06:34] waver something
[2:06:35] ask if sometimes you get impatient or
[2:06:39] get lukewarm just kind of waver a little
[2:06:42] bit
[2:06:44] and you're not patient you're not you're
[2:06:46] not
[2:06:48] diligent in your prayer life like you
[2:06:49] should be
[2:06:50] you say god help me lord jesus
[2:06:54] establish my heart father help me lord
[2:06:56] be patient to your coming god bless you
[2:06:58] god bless those hands all over the
[2:07:00] building lord jesus it's so easy for it
[2:07:03] to happen in this hour that we're living
