[0:00] You've got dominion over that flesh. And
[0:03] he says you've got dominion and over the
[0:06] devil.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; So you've got dominion over You don't
[0:11] have to fall for his lies anymore. You
[0:14] don't have to listen to him and his
[0:16] tricks. You don't have to listen to him
[0:18] and his folly when he tells you you're
[0:20] not good enough. You can't make it.
[0:22] You're not bride. Those are lies and
[0:25] tricks of the devil. And you have been
[0:27] given domain, dominion.
[0:31] over his lies, over his tricks, when he
[0:36] says you're not going to make it, when
[0:37] he says you're going to fail.
[0:39] Get thee behind me, Satan. Do you see
[0:42] where the word comes into play? We've
[0:45] been shown all the tricks of the trade.
[0:47] Our father was a craftsman. He was a
[0:49] carpenter. He knew all the tricks of the
[0:51] trade. And he laid it out word for word
[0:53] for word in the Bible so that we would
[0:55] have the the ability to have the
[0:57] dominion over what Satan throws at us.
[1:01] Yes indeed, even now we are seated in
[1:04] heavenly places. He says he's showing
[1:06] forth his praise and glory, showing
[1:08] forth himself for it is Christ in us.
[1:13] And as long as we keep that at the
[1:15] forefront that it's Christ in us, it's
[1:18] not us manufacturing. It's not us doing.
[1:20] It's not because we study. It's not
[1:22] because we we do this or that. It's
[1:23] because we were predestined before the
[1:26] foundation of the world for a purpose.
[1:31] Let's read in Genesis 3:14 and 15.
[1:35] I want you to notice here God setting
[1:36] some things in order. We know the scene.
[1:40] We know the scenario. We know what's
[1:41] happened in the garden here.
[1:44] And so now God's coming down to set some
[1:46] things in order and take back, should we
[1:49] say, what the enemy stole. He went to
[1:52] the enemy's camp and he took back what
[1:55] he stole from him. Some of us need to
[1:58] get in our minds that we're going to go
[2:00] down to the enemy's camp today and we're
[2:03] going to take back what he's stolen from
[2:05] us. So if you're sitting here depressed,
[2:11] take it back. If you're sitting here
[2:13] full of anxiety and fear and doubt, go
[2:16] down to the enemy's camp and take it
[2:18] back because the order has been placed.
[2:21] [Music]
