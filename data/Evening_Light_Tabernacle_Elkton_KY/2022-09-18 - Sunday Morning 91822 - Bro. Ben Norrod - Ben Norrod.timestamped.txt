[8:51] every need the thoughts of every heart
[8:54] Jesus Christ's name amen and amen
[9:00] children are dismissed for Sunday School
[9:08] you would turn with me into the book of
[9:10] Psalms uh we're going to read chapter 63
[9:16] probably read this many times this is
[9:19] David it finds herself in the wilderness
[9:21] and
[9:22] uh it's a it's a good good Psalm there
[9:25] and you I like where he says early I'll
[9:28] seek you and when I go to bed I'll be
[9:30] meditating on you so he's constantly no
[9:31] matter where he's at and it shows us no
[9:33] matter where we're at in our life what
[9:35] we're going through God should be our
[9:37] focus and he's there for so Charles
[9:40] Spurgeon he he wrote in his commentary
[9:42] said that in the early days uh the early
[9:45] Christians it was a decree and they were
[9:47] ordained to sing this Psalm at least
[9:50] once a day every Christian so pretty
[9:53] interesting when you think about it that
[9:55] way how important the psalm is so Psalm
[9:57] 63 oh God Thou Art my God early will I
[10:00] seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my
[10:04] flesh long for thee in a dry and thirsty
[10:07] land where no water is
[10:10] foreign
[10:17] kindness is better than life my lips
[10:20] shall praise thee
[10:26] my soul shall be satisfied as with my
[10:29] myrow and fatness and my mouth shall
[10:32] praise thee with joyful lips
[10:40] because thou has been my help therefore
[10:43] in the shadow of thy Wings will I
[10:45] rejoice
[10:47] she's so alone
[10:52] but those that seek my soul to destroy
[10:55] it shall go into the lower parts of the
[10:57] Earth
[11:03] all together but the king shall rejoice
[11:06] in God every one that sweareth by him
[11:09] shall Glory but the mouth of them that
[11:13] speak lies shall be stopped
[11:16] bless you
[11:17] good job
[11:19] oh I'm sorry brother Brian
[11:21] I forgot to tell everybody this morning
[11:23] Sister Janice gives everybody uh her
[11:26] greetings amen so God bless you continue
[11:28] to pray for her amen she's made it to
[11:30] Russellville and she says she's really
[11:31] looking forward to walking again so
[11:33] I says you can do it amen by God's grace
[11:41] if you return with me to the third
[11:43] chapter of Lamentations you know what
[11:46] brother uh
[11:47] Brad was saying is so true to what your
[11:50] focus is is going to bring about the
[11:52] circumstances in your life if you're
[11:54] focusing on the negative all your life
[11:56] that's what you're going to have if you
[11:58] focus on the positive
[12:00] the positive is what you're going to
[12:02] have
[12:03] doesn't mean you don't have tribulations
[12:04] and struggles we all have tribulations
[12:07] and struggle but whatever and anything
[12:09] hard happens to you where do you go do
[12:13] you immediately go in the negative or
[12:15] you just turn to the Lord and put that
[12:18] before that's that's where we have to be
[12:20] and I was uh
[12:22] Lamentations to 26th chapter
[12:26] I was just thinking you know Jeremiah
[12:28] when he wrote These Lamentations
[12:31] it's our day exactly like his day no but
[12:34] the things that politically
[12:36] spiritually naturally fell going on
[12:40] around that time are kind of close to
[12:42] where we're at this morning and uh even
[12:45] through all that or everything that
[12:46] Jeremiah had to see is the prophet of
[12:49] his day that happened to the children of
[12:51] Israel he still had a perspective he
[12:54] still put his trust in the law of God
[12:56] but uh before I get started I was just
[12:58] going to mention this this morning
[13:00] as of this morning uh
[13:03] the the insurance for the church for the
[13:06] upcoming years totally paid
[13:08] and a brother brushed us with that and
[13:11] the fuel the Summerfield is paid for and
[13:15] the winner prepaid is paid for not in
[13:18] the last two years because of the price
[13:21] of propane I haven't been paying as much
[13:24] for the winter Phil I paid for a
[13:27] thousand gallons
[13:28] and uh which was a pretty which was like
[13:32] twenty four hundred and eighty dollars
[13:33] for a thousand gallons and maybe the
[13:35] lower blesses and not have a bad winter
[13:37] and that'll be enough for the year but
[13:40] going if you have any questions don't be
[13:42] afraid to ask me I was going to tell you
[13:44] what was in the general fund
[13:47] but there's been a lot going on
[13:49] financially and
[13:51] uh the bank the the statements I get to
[13:54] balance the checkbook are coming later
[13:56] in the month so as soon as I have that
[13:58] I'll let you know but if you would go
[14:00] with me to Lamentations the third
[14:01] chapter
[14:03] and then if you want to mark your Bible
[14:05] to the 30th chapter of Psalms
[14:08] uh I'll read from about the uh this is
[14:11] what uh Jeremiah had to say I'll start
[14:15] at about the 21st this is what he said
[14:18] this I recall to my mind therefore have
[14:20] I hoped
[14:23] it is of the Lord's mercies that we are
[14:25] not consumed because his compassions
[14:28] fell not no matter what the
[14:30] circumstances were Jeremiah had a a very
[14:34] good perspective on things that were
[14:36] going on there are they are new every
[14:39] morning and great is thy faithfulness
[14:42] the Lord is my portion saith my soul
[14:45] therefore will I hope in him
[14:48] the Lord is good unto them they wait on
[14:51] him
[14:51] and to the soul that seek him and then
[14:54] it is good that a man should both hope
[14:57] and quietly wait for the Salvation of
[15:00] the Lord and I was thinking about that
[15:02] this morning and jumping back to this
[15:05] 30th psalm
[15:07] I was about to say something I say a lot
[15:10] but I held my tongue here um
[15:13] David says the same thing in the 30th
[15:16] psalm
[15:17] you know
[15:19] I know I teach a lot of Sunday schools
[15:20] about
[15:21] the proper type of Hope a Christian
[15:23] should have the hope you have is to
[15:27] settled Affair between you and your
[15:29] savior this morning it's not a
[15:31] wishy-washy hope it's not a non it's a
[15:34] actual Eternal hope that God has given
[15:37] you if you've walked in faith into Jesus
[15:40] Christ you've received the baptism of
[15:43] the Holy Ghost then no matter what
[15:45] happens to you in your life whatever
[15:47] circumstances are going on the end is
[15:50] already settled so that gives you a
[15:53] great hope in your life that you can
[15:54] hold fast of the truth that God's given
[15:57] you but I'll read this 30th Psalm this
[15:59] morning
[16:01] I will extoll thee Oh Lord for thou Has
[16:04] Lifted Me Up and thou has made my
[16:06] fullest to Rejoice Over Me O Lord I've
[16:08] Cried unto thee and thou has healed me
[16:10] and that's all we all hope that every
[16:13] day oh Lord thou has brought up my soul
[16:15] from the grave thou has kept me alive
[16:18] that I should not go down to the pit
[16:21] sing unto the Lord O ye Saints of his
[16:23] and give thanks at the remembrance of
[16:25] his holiness
[16:27] you know David gives us perspective he
[16:29] gives us principles and his Psalms that
[16:31] we need to apply to our lives every day
[16:34] and he goes on the for his anger and
[16:36] door but a moment in his favor is life
[16:39] weeping may endure for a night but joy
[16:42] cometh in the morning and I was thinking
[16:44] that's what we were reading in Jeremiah
[16:46] and what he's saying here you know
[16:49] you've all had situations in your life
[16:51] wherever you know before you go to bed
[16:53] that night you got the whole world's
[16:55] weight on your shoulders you're
[16:57] wondering how you're going to make it no
[16:59] matter what that situation is you
[17:01] finally get to sleep and you wake up in
[17:03] the morning and everything seems just a
[17:05] a whole lot better or a little bit
[17:07] better well that's the same thing when
[17:09] you pray and you get before the Lord
[17:11] everything might seem hard like there's
[17:14] no way out and before you know it God
[17:16] will give you peace in your heart and
[17:18] there'll be a way out you know just what
[17:20] you're trusting in and what you're
[17:22] depending on make and I'll finish this
[17:25] this morning
[17:27] I apologize if I re-read the same
[17:29] scriptures again for his anger and Earth
[17:32] but a moment in his favor in his life
[17:34] weeping man door for a night but joy
[17:36] cometh in the morning and then my
[17:38] Prosperity I said I shall never be moved
[17:41] but by thy favor thou has made my
[17:43] mountains to stand strong thou didst
[17:46] hide my face and I was troubled I cried
[17:49] to thee O Lord and unto the Lord I made
[17:51] my supplications
[17:53] what prophet is there in my blood when I
[17:56] that shall the dust praise thee shall it
[17:59] declare thy truth here Lord and have
[18:01] mercy upon me Lord be thou my helper
[18:04] thou has turned for me my more morning
[18:06] into dancing that was put off my
[18:10] sackcloth and girded me with gladness to
[18:13] the end that my glory may sing praise to
[18:15] thee and not be silent O Lord my God I
[18:18] will give thanks unto thee forever and
[18:20] I'm just going to jump in my Thompson
[18:23] Chain reference Bible over here and I
[18:25] hope I marked it right
[18:29] I'll I'll just read a few of these
[18:31] scriptures that deal with you know with
[18:33] hope
[18:34] uh
[18:37] I'll just I'll read this one here from
[18:40] uh Corinthians the first chapter and the
[18:43] fifth verse
[18:45] I'm losing my training Authority here
[18:46] but acts 24 and 15. and I have hope
[18:50] toward God which they themselves also
[18:53] out loud that there shall be a
[18:54] resurrection of the dead but both of the
[18:57] just and the unjust so that's something
[18:59] we're all not going to escape but like I
[19:02] said a couple of minutes ago if Jesus
[19:04] Christ is in the center of your heart
[19:06] then there's no fear when you go to that
[19:09] direction and he goes on to say and
[19:12] uh Colossians the first chapter in the
[19:14] fifth verse for the Hope which is laid
[19:16] up for you in heaven wherefore you heard
[19:18] before in the word of Truth and gospel
[19:22] and then Titus
[19:23] the second chapter in the 13th verse
[19:26] looking for the Blessed hope and the
[19:29] glories appearing of our great God
[19:33] Our Savior Jesus Christ and then this
[19:36] last one is pretty important here
[19:39] and it and it's really it's Hebrews 6
[19:42] and 18 and we all know the scripture by
[19:44] heart there are two immutable things in
[19:46] which it is impossible for God to lie so
[19:49] God is it's impossible whatever God
[19:51] promised in his word he's going to bring
[19:54] about it he can't lie he isn't lying to
[19:56] you if you hold faster the truth he
[19:58] gives you you'll be there on that day
[20:01] and he goes for God's Alive
[20:03] that we might have strong consolation
[20:05] who have fled for a refuge to lay hold
[20:09] upon the hope that set before us which
[20:12] hope we have as an anchor of the soul
[20:14] but sure in steadfast and which enter
[20:17] into within the valve so that's my hope
[20:19] this morning I hope everyone's hope is
[20:22] whatever promises God has given in his
[20:25] word that you need this morning he's
[20:27] more than able to meet those needs for
[20:29] you and like I said no one gets out of
[20:31] this life without a little struggle
[20:33] without a little problem but we all get
[20:35] out of this life of our relationship is
[20:38] right with the hope of knowing that God
[20:40] has set the course for us on the other
[20:42] side and I was thinking what brother
[20:44] Brad was saying about Spurgeon I mean
[20:48] people don't talk they called him the
[20:50] prince of preachers but you know the one
[20:53] thing he always brought people back to
[20:55] and and it's the same thing with brother
[20:57] Brian or any real man of God is they'll
[21:01] always bring you back to the word of God
[21:03] to the truth they won't have their own
[21:06] ideas or their own ways but everything
[21:08] they'll teach you is right back to the
[21:11] word of God brother Josh
[21:23] hey man let's down this morning
[21:28] I'm happy to be in this presence this
[21:29] morning
[21:30] man
[21:31] I want to welcome to all of our visitors

[21:43] praying and just talking to the Lord and
[21:46] saying Lord we're always coming to you
[21:47] and asking what we can get from you but
[21:49] this morning I just want to wash his
[21:51] feet a little bit just what can I give
[21:53] to you Lord so let's give them our
[21:55] worship this morning and

[49:36] the Lord this morning amen good to be in

[49:40] just a little bit if you'd like I want
[49:42] to invite
[49:43] my wife to come if she will
[49:47] um
[49:47] get right into the preaching of the word
[49:49] of the Lord I want to tell you quickly
[49:51] while we're in this part of the service
[49:54] I get to the preaching part I'm going to
[49:56] forget it all together but I want to let
[49:59] you know that we did by the grace of God
[50:01] make it to the Congo just a few weeks
[50:04] ago remember I had y'all praying about
[50:06] that trip and we've been trying for
[50:08] several years to make it happen and uh
[50:11] just by the help of the lord we
[50:14] you know I'm going to say it like this
[50:16] just to sum it all up there's a lot of
[50:18] talk in here but just to sum it all up
[50:20] when it don't work it's the hardest most
[50:22] difficult thing you've ever seen in your
[50:24] life when the Lord's ready and it's time
[50:26] it just
[50:28] everything even the flights where I was
[50:30] sitting right down to even the waiters
[50:33] we got in a restaurant at Serbia Pepsi I
[50:35] mean they were just everything was just
[50:37] perfect and I just give you this little
[50:40] report if you don't mind me sharing it
[50:42] with you and uh
[50:45] all this talking I did through these
[50:47] years about asking you to pray about I
[50:48] better say something amen but um we were
[50:52] assembled together in a meeting that
[50:54] they as I understand been trying to put
[50:56] back together for about three or four
[50:58] years since the pandemic started and
[51:00] this particular meeting was one of not
[51:03] just a matter and Africa meeting or an
[51:07] African meeting but it was the African
[51:09] meeting as I understand it this is one
[51:11] they've been pushing to get to uh for a
[51:14] number of years there was over 800
[51:16] ministers gathered at one time for a
[51:18] Minister's meeting the very beginning of
[51:20] it and as I understand there was four or
[51:22] five thousand here in the building and
[51:24] then behind us right behind us and you
[51:26] could hear them hollering amen
[51:28] but right over the window line there's
[51:30] about five more thousand kind of back
[51:32] tucked in this side over there and uh
[51:34] Laura
[51:36] Laura what are you doing here
[51:38] God bless you I've known that girl my
[51:41] whole life
[51:42] she's a buckeye amen oh and I O ain't
[51:46] that right says hey man oh my goodness I
[51:50] like to fell over I saw you over there
[51:51] Hallelujah Sam where'd you go it's Laura
[51:54] you didn't tell me you should have
[51:56] wiggled
[51:59] but anyways we um so as I understand it
[52:03] back behind us there was about five
[52:04] thousand gathered in the building there
[52:07] was a lot of them that couldn't come
[52:08] because their countries were restricting
[52:10] them because of covet and other things
[52:11] there was 25
[52:14] 000 online represented in the seven
[52:16] continents or but I think even the
[52:19] Penguins and the polar bears were
[52:20] listening to this meeting and uh so it
[52:23] was a very large Gathering and the
[52:25] message or the theme I should say was
[52:28] based upon the vision of brother Branham
[52:31] and the message now that we're at this
[52:32] time period online what do we do now
[52:34] where are we heading and what's the
[52:35] whole purpose of it and so you know just
[52:38] by the help of the Lord
[52:39] this may sound very arrogant you forgive
[52:42] me for this in advance I don't mean this
[52:44] to sound arrogantly but
[52:46] Americans have a better view of this
[52:48] than other countries do and I'll tell
[52:50] you why we are 20 years Beyond where
[52:54] many of them are just now coming into
[52:55] things
[52:57] so we experienced 20 years ago and it
[53:00] gives me a little bit of a special
[53:02] Advantage when I go there to be able to
[53:04] see where they're at in the conditions
[53:05] of it and you can almost like you're
[53:07] looking in the history book you can see
[53:09] the same behaviors and the same choices
[53:11] and things being made that we made that
[53:13] either put us in a better place or a
[53:15] worse place and so you know by the help
[53:17] of the Lord I'm able to see those things
[53:18] so when I go I can warn them and I can
[53:21] bless them I can give them caution and I
[53:24] can tell them Full Speed Ahead so it's
[53:26] been good and and we saw a lot of great
[53:29] effects I'm still getting messages and
[53:31] things from people saying you know how
[53:32] their lives were changed and all that
[53:34] that's what we go for we like to hear
[53:36] that and but can you imagine some 35 000
[53:40] people tuned in at one time listening to
[53:43] The Messengers 30 speakers in this
[53:45] convention so there's a lot of great
[53:47] great preachers and we got to the very
[53:50] end of the meeting and as I understand
[53:51] it the place of honor in these meetings
[53:53] is the last one and so we get down to
[53:56] the last two hours to the meeting and
[53:58] they they whisked me away into this room
[54:00] to sit down and usually they serve your
[54:02] private like that as a guest they'll
[54:03] bring people food and things I thought
[54:05] well I've come all this way just to
[54:07] listen to some good preaching go home
[54:09] and be served in her or whatever and
[54:10] that was it all at once the door flew
[54:13] open and they started hollering come on
[54:14] come on it's your turn to church they
[54:17] have put me in the very Choice place of
[54:18] the entire meeting and I'm thankful to
[54:21] God for that because I got the
[54:23] opportunity to hear all what was being
[54:25] said then gather all of that up and
[54:27] bring a summary to it and I just feel
[54:30] like it was the mind of the Lord and
[54:31] really in a way and I don't mean this
[54:33] about me again if it sounds arrogant I
[54:35] don't mean it that way or prideful but I
[54:36] just see the hand of the Lord in it that
[54:39] you understand I'm on the road 52
[54:40] weekends a year ago sometimes you know
[54:44] uh 60 70 000 miles a year all around the
[54:47] nation and what better person could God
[54:49] have chose than somebody's had that kind
[54:51] of bird's eye view of where we are
[54:53] around the message in the different
[54:54] churches to be able to project a vision
[54:56] to the people about where we are in the
[54:59] messes so I could see the hand of the
[55:00] Lord in it and God has given me give me
[55:03] a lot of Grace and give me words to say
[55:05] and how to say it and we heard nothing
[55:07] but one benefit after another for the
[55:10] things and the con and what was spoken
[55:12] things that we could share in our
[55:13] experiences so please from the bottom of
[55:16] my heart let me say how grateful I am
[55:18] how thankful I am for you being able to
[55:21] pray for us and uh you know hold us up
[55:23] before the Lord in prayer and whatever
[55:26] prayers you've contributed for the last
[55:28] few years we've been trying to make this
[55:29] happen it's mission accomplished at this
[55:32] point so we thank God for it remember
[55:34] not I'm saying these things not uh it's
[55:37] hard not to say it in a certain way it
[55:39] sounds braggy in a way I don't mean it
[55:40] that way as far as that goes anybody
[55:42] could preach the message but the point
[55:45] I'm making is that the Lord knows how to
[55:47] put the right people in the right places
[55:49] at the right moment to say the right
[55:51] things and that's what I'm meaning is
[55:52] that the Lord took all of this that I've
[55:54] done for the last 20 years full time and
[55:56] allowed me just to put that right out
[55:58] there before the people and when you see
[55:59] them sometimes leaning toward the
[56:01] prophet too much everything was brother
[56:02] Brown brother Brown brother Brown
[56:03] brother Brown I see as an American I go
[56:06] back 25 years and we did the same thing
[56:07] in the 80s and I can tell them too much
[56:11] on that that you're going to start
[56:12] leaning this way then you see certain
[56:14] doctrines and things sneaking in the
[56:15] back door you can say I I
[56:18] let me tell you where that led to
[56:19] brother Brandon called those in his life
[56:21] story Stepping Stones
[56:23] he said in May the life that I share
[56:25] with you today may be stepping stones
[56:27] that you won't make the same mistakes
[56:29] that we did so by the grace of God they
[56:33] uh they received a a very thorough
[56:36] explanation of what that looks like so
[56:37] let me put it that way but uh listen we
[56:40] love you and we thank you so much and
[56:43] I um I I didn't get many pictures to
[56:45] share maybe just one of the crowd or
[56:47] something I know when we come from Egypt
[56:49] I shared the presentation with you and
[56:51] um that was quite an extraordinary thing
[56:53] in itself seeing there's only one
[56:54] message Church in Egypt only one at this
[56:57] point and the way the Lord is beginning
[56:59] to break ground in some of these areas
[57:01] you can sit and listen and watch the
[57:03] people beginning to come up come up come
[57:05] up come up to some of the great
[57:07] Revelations that the Lord has been given
[57:09] to us here in the United States and uh
[57:12] being that this is Ground Zero what the
[57:14] Lord shares with us a lot of times it'll
[57:16] come here first because we got books and
[57:18] English is available that's a big thing
[57:21] just having English available then being
[57:23] French speakers you know it's a little
[57:24] more difficult to get the understandings
[57:26] the translations they don't know what
[57:28] hair and a biscuit means there's no
[57:30] translation for that and it was hair in
[57:32] a biscuit mean but I said a lot was like
[57:34] a hair and a biscuit a gaggy thing gaggy
[57:36] doesn't have a French word that I know
[57:38] of Amen but you know for us we catch
[57:40] that quickly especially some of you
[57:42] southern people here you know that speak
[57:44] that kind of uh hillbilly type you know
[57:47] cultural Southern type language like
[57:49] that you understand brother Brown
[57:50] plainly it took him a year to figure out
[57:52] what he was trying to get at and so you
[57:54] know we we get things a lot quicker here
[57:56] and uh but you I was really impressed to
[57:59] see the brother they're coming right up
[58:01] into the very understanding of not just
[58:04] the God sent a prophet but what was the
[58:07] message he was sent here to bring us and
[58:08] what is our position in it and seeing
[58:11] that made my heart swell brother I was
[58:14] swelling bigger than any number of
[58:15] people in that entire country out there
[58:17] just to see that because
[58:19] you want to see that if the bride is
[58:22] going to go all at the same time one in
[58:24] the bed and one in the field well then
[58:26] they have to have the same understanding
[58:27] the same Revelation they got to come up
[58:29] to the same place all of us have got to
[58:31] be on the same page you can't have some
[58:32] little kid down here not even
[58:34] understanding so to speak spiritually
[58:35] not understanding who Jesus Christ is
[58:38] and they do one or three or whatever it
[58:39] is and then all of us up here on the
[58:41] Capstone side and him down there not
[58:43] even know his position God's just as
[58:45] obligated that that one right there as
[58:47] he was this one right over here and the
[58:49] Lord will give us an equal type
[58:50] Revelation in many of those things now I
[58:53] know brother Brown said that there's a
[58:54] babe in Christ so if they're in Christ
[58:56] they'll go when the Rapture if their
[58:58] names on the boat they're going the
[58:59] Rapture comes but the majority of the
[59:01] bride of Christ should have some kind of
[59:04] understanding because this is the
[59:06] placing of sons and daughters in the
[59:09] last day so skim milk is part of it but
[59:12] we're Way Beyond skim milk into the
[59:14] understanding of who the mystery is all
[59:16] about that was me I was a part of that
[59:17] you you were a part of that Revelation
[59:19] and then to see the Brethren climbing
[59:21] into that realm that just does your
[59:23] heart so good you just want to scream
[59:24] and shout and holler and praise the Lord
[59:25] so thank God for it and um
[59:30] as far as that goes now leaving the
[59:32] meeting of course many places around the
[59:34] world now that you know hey come bring
[59:36] some of that over here and come visit us
[59:38] here in this that and the other way you
[59:40] know you don't just take every beating
[59:41] you get at least I don't I pray over
[59:43] them and pray over and pray over them
[59:44] but will you just add this prayer to the
[59:47] whole
[59:48] you know the conglomeration of the whole
[59:50] thing just pray that the Lord will lead
[59:52] me on whatever the next steps in the
[59:54] mission work is that he'll show me
[59:55] exactly where I need to go when and how
[59:57] I need to get there will you do that for
[59:59] me and man God bless you so much
[1:00:01] appreciate you again I hope I don't
[1:00:03] sound arrogant or prideful I'm just
[1:00:05] telling you how it was it's just it is
[1:00:07] what it is and there ain't no is or my
[1:00:08] grandma used to say and that's what it
[1:00:10] boils down to and uh but I appreciated
[1:00:12] you know the way the Brethren treated us

[1:18:18] appreciate the Lord Jesus he's just so
[1:18:20] good to us and uh the Lord helping us I
[1:18:22] want to go this morning in Ephesians
[1:18:24] chapter 5 verse 22. Ephesians 5 22 22 23
[1:18:29] and 24. my speech this morning the Lord
[1:18:31] helping us upon the ministry of
[1:18:33] surrender
[1:18:35] the ministry of surrender you heard the
[1:18:37] song that we uh we're invited to the
[1:18:39] pulpit on surrendering the kingdoms of
[1:18:42] our heart and that was just absolutely
[1:18:44] uh directed by the Lord to sing that in
[1:18:47] the first place because that was exactly
[1:18:48] where I had my mind settled today I
[1:18:51] wanted to um I shouldn't say I had it
[1:18:53] settled I was
[1:18:55] 60 percent there and I just kept
[1:18:58] wondering what the Lord would do and how
[1:18:59] he would bring it and when the brother
[1:19:01] sang the song and and invited us I
[1:19:04] thought well that's what I've been
[1:19:05] waiting on is that little something I'll
[1:19:07] let you know amen Ephesians 5 22. now I
[1:19:11] know you're looking at your Bible
[1:19:12] already sisters just relax this is not a
[1:19:15] message on marriage and divorce I'm not
[1:19:16] going to try to get you straightened out
[1:19:18] I'm going to use this as a spiritual
[1:19:19] time like brother Brown did an invisible
[1:19:21] union he said that the natural marriage
[1:19:23] type the spiritual part
[1:19:25] and that's what we're going to show this
[1:19:26] morning is the spiritual condition the
[1:19:28] bride what she's able to do wives submit
[1:19:32] yourself under your own husbands as unto
[1:19:34] the Lord but the husband is the head of
[1:19:37] the wife even as Christ is the head of
[1:19:39] the church and he is the savior of the
[1:19:42] body therefore as the church is subject
[1:19:45] unto Christ
[1:19:47] let so let the wives be to their own
[1:19:50] husbands in everything now
[1:19:53] let me just put a little piece in here
[1:19:55] like this
[1:19:56] Brothers when it says everything that
[1:19:59] doesn't mean that you need to know you
[1:20:02] know what day of the week she's going to
[1:20:03] go grocery shopping or you know what
[1:20:05] color clothes she's going to wear next
[1:20:07] Sunday what does referring to as in the
[1:20:10] Lord the things that are subjected to
[1:20:12] Christ the things that are given in the
[1:20:14] Lord I I forgive this this is not good
[1:20:16] Pulpit talk but I know men years ago
[1:20:19] when I was a boy that even wanted to
[1:20:20] know them women had to call to get
[1:20:21] permission to go to the bathroom and I'm
[1:20:23] not lying to you that I've had that had
[1:20:25] that experience of seeing that that
[1:20:27] ain't nothing but abuse
[1:20:30] come on Brothers louder
[1:20:32] that ain't nothing but abuse that's all
[1:20:34] it is right taking advantage of
[1:20:36] something in the Bible to make make a
[1:20:38] dictator out of yourself right
[1:20:40] the message Jehovah driver says a woman
[1:20:42] it is her name a trivial woman to
[1:20:45] surrender to a man and it is the nature
[1:20:48] of the church to surrender to Christ
[1:20:50] surrender to his will just surrender
[1:20:54] she has no thinking of her own she takes
[1:20:57] his word on somebody else's if Eve would
[1:21:00] have done that we would have never had
[1:21:03] to die but she listened to the
[1:21:05] reasonings but the real bride of Christ
[1:21:07] takes the headship of Christ the word
[1:21:10] hallelujah brother says and only
[1:21:12] believes God's word that's the real
[1:21:15] restored bride and it says it again
[1:21:17] hallelujah amen let's pray over the word
[1:21:20] can we
[1:21:21] why your heads are bowed this morning if
[1:21:23] you'd like to be remembered in prayer
[1:21:24] just let it be known by the lifting of
[1:21:26] your hand amen my hand's up to Lord
[1:21:29] Jesus what a privilege it is to come
[1:21:31] into this place
[1:21:33] we're so grateful Lord for the love that
[1:21:36] you've said abroad to all of us and
[1:21:37] father we are so grateful for the
[1:21:39] visitation of your presence today Lord
[1:21:42] Jesus in this service where we've
[1:21:43] assembled ourselves together we do it in
[1:21:46] the name of Jesus Christ knowing that
[1:21:49] thou art God and your angels in power
[1:21:52] and Supremacy is right here with us this
[1:21:54] morning to do all above what we could
[1:21:58] abundantly even ask or think now Lord we
[1:22:01] are opening our hearts to not only Thy
[1:22:02] word but to thy leadership and thy
[1:22:05] willingness to come and do for us what
[1:22:07] we cannot do for ourself take Thy word
[1:22:10] may you minister to us take me as a
[1:22:13] vessel may you use me to do it may I get
[1:22:15] completely out of the way that you could
[1:22:16] speak through my mouth and my actions
[1:22:19] and so forth law that you could bring
[1:22:21] great uh blessing as it were to the body
[1:22:24] of Christ not through me so much but
[1:22:27] through the word that will be spoken in
[1:22:30] this service May the power of God open
[1:22:32] the heart of every person Lord you've
[1:22:34] seen the hand that was raised every life
[1:22:37] that is represented in here this morning
[1:22:38] Lord with that hand in the air they have
[1:22:41] a need from you and God they're
[1:22:42] depending on you to be the one to see
[1:22:44] that need through Lord how many times
[1:22:46] our hand may have shot up wandering
[1:22:48] praying expecting waiting sometimes
[1:22:51] patiently sometimes impatiently oh God
[1:22:53] when's it going to come but Lord thou
[1:22:56] art mindful of a sparrow you're mindful
[1:22:58] of every time we put our hands in the
[1:22:59] air signifying we need your help we
[1:23:02] commit every need every spoken unspoken
[1:23:04] request Lord to the hands of Jesus
[1:23:06] Christ be with our Brethren actors Lord
[1:23:09] in all of the places that might be
[1:23:11] streaming in their homes or wherever
[1:23:13] they might be this morning and us here
[1:23:14] in the general assembly granted in the
[1:23:17] name of Jesus Christ we pray and the
[1:23:19] Saints said amen and amen you may be
[1:23:21] seated may the Lord bless you really
[1:23:23] good
[1:23:24] we thank the Lord for the mercy of God
[1:23:27] you know that's another thing now that
[1:23:28] I'm pulling my jacket off they're not
[1:23:29] one of them preachers pulled their
[1:23:31] jacket off and hit 115 over there and I
[1:23:33] said
[1:23:34] how in the world do you preach with a
[1:23:36] code on your body I never understand
[1:23:37] that I said there's two things I learned
[1:23:40] you can't do in a coat you can't eat and
[1:23:41] you can't fight we're about to do both
[1:23:43] of them amen
[1:23:44] amen but we appreciate thank you brother
[1:23:47] we appreciate the Lord Jesus and I I
[1:23:49] want to take if God will help me this
[1:23:51] morning I want to take some of these
[1:23:53] little places that we're going to use as
[1:23:55] um uh as a parallel to the spiritual
[1:23:58] church and I want to just kindly dwell
[1:24:01] upon these verses in Ephesians for just
[1:24:04] a little bit and if you'll bear with me
[1:24:07] in some of the talk that I'm going to
[1:24:09] talk for just a moment about home and
[1:24:11] home life and things now again this is
[1:24:14] not a sneaky way for me to start laying
[1:24:16] it on to sisters so don't be nervous I
[1:24:19] know preachers do that sometimes but
[1:24:20] this is not a bad boy I'm not looking
[1:24:22] for a way to get the women in line I
[1:24:24] feel like that by God's grace that if a
[1:24:26] woman is right with the Lord and she's
[1:24:29] wanting to serve the Lord in the best
[1:24:30] way she knows how that the Lord can
[1:24:32] teach her and show her how how to submit
[1:24:35] properly and all of that so I I'm not
[1:24:37] here to tell you to get your bathroom
[1:24:38] breaks on the schedule for your for you
[1:24:40] for your husband okay that ain't gonna
[1:24:41] happen but I I want to use this not may
[1:24:44] sound strong what I'm going to say I
[1:24:46] want to focus just a little bit on the
[1:24:48] negative part of of women of what we
[1:24:50] know and remember when I say this now
[1:24:52] brother Branham tells us in marriage and
[1:24:54] divorce that when he's relaying it on
[1:24:56] hard about that prostitute type spirit
[1:24:59] and that unwillingness to have kids and
[1:25:01] all that kind of things he said now
[1:25:02] remember
[1:25:03] I'm not talking about you sisters I'm
[1:25:06] talking about the women of the world
[1:25:07] lady Lucia those without the Holy Ghost
[1:25:09] so it's the same thing here today and
[1:25:12] really ultimately my purpose in bringing
[1:25:14] this is I want to show us as the people
[1:25:17] of God the way that we are going to be
[1:25:20] able to not only surrender to the Lord
[1:25:22] but the way that it's already been put
[1:25:23] in us to be surrendered people
[1:25:27] because
[1:25:28] I guess um you know you're getting these
[1:25:31] prayer lines and your people the
[1:25:33] restaurants and you you know how does
[1:25:34] being a minister you hear a lot of
[1:25:36] things about oh I fight this battle and
[1:25:39] I'm troubled this way and that way and
[1:25:41] on and on and the main theme of all of
[1:25:44] it is is that some people just don't
[1:25:46] believe that they have the ability to
[1:25:48] surrender to the Lord and they're
[1:25:50] waiting for this one moment and I see
[1:25:52] this again and again and with Brad you
[1:25:54] know brother Paris you know when you
[1:25:56] deal with people they're waiting for
[1:25:58] some kind of lightning bolt push button
[1:26:00] pull a lever moment where all of a
[1:26:03] sudden they're going to hit this place
[1:26:04] in Christ where they're just gonna and
[1:26:06] become a surrendered Christian almost
[1:26:08] overnight immediately and on the moment
[1:26:11] on the spot the truth of it is is it's
[1:26:13] not so much that we don't have the
[1:26:15] ability to do
[1:26:17] these things it's that we as God's
[1:26:20] people have not recognized that it's
[1:26:23] laying in us already we just haven't
[1:26:25] learned how to tap into that part that
[1:26:28] has already been given to us by the Holy
[1:26:30] Ghost now girls you sitting around here
[1:26:32] that's unmarried you may think to
[1:26:33] yourself okay what's the future look
[1:26:35] like and what's the man I'm gonna marry
[1:26:36] look like and what kind of person is it
[1:26:38] going to be you'll wonder all of that
[1:26:40] and I know girls you've probably been
[1:26:41] many of the sisters are already married
[1:26:43] they could probably testify you've been
[1:26:45] planning your wedding since you were old
[1:26:46] enough to plan
[1:26:48] do you know exactly what kind of flowers
[1:26:49] you want uh what the building's probably
[1:26:51] going to look like we've got all of
[1:26:53] these plants laid out but I'm sure that
[1:26:55] on top of all of that there's also this
[1:26:58] curiosity within you what kind of a
[1:27:00] woman am I going to be what kind of wife
[1:27:02] am I going to be and the reason that if
[1:27:05] you'll stop and just think for a moment
[1:27:06] in a spiritual way the reason that you
[1:27:09] even consider things like that what kind
[1:27:11] of wife what kind of housekeeper what
[1:27:13] kind of uh you know just just name it
[1:27:15] right down the list of what you might be
[1:27:17] the reason you wonder those things is
[1:27:19] because God has already provided within
[1:27:23] you that working knowledge even though
[1:27:25] it may lay dormant it may lay suddenly
[1:27:27] underneath your subconscious kind of
[1:27:29] hidden in there God has already provided
[1:27:32] in you the ability to do the thing
[1:27:34] that's why you're even wondering about
[1:27:36] it in the first place because you see
[1:27:38] curiosity of that nature leads you to
[1:27:41] expression those are the things that
[1:27:43] when you begin to understand okay I want
[1:27:46] to be a good woman I want to be
[1:27:47] supportive I want to be a good cook or I
[1:27:50] want to be a seamstress or whatever it
[1:27:52] is for the house and and do what it
[1:27:54] takes to maybe even work or whatever the
[1:27:56] Lord leads you to do that Curiosity
[1:27:59] within you is God's given deep that's
[1:28:01] calling out to another deep and remember
[1:28:03] how the prophet paralleled that for us
[1:28:05] he said before there was a fit on a
[1:28:07] fish's back in other words before there
[1:28:09] was a wife there was already the
[1:28:11] characteristics laying in her to be able
[1:28:14] to do the thing that she was wanting to
[1:28:16] do before there was been on a fish's
[1:28:18] back uh there was water to put him in
[1:28:20] now think about this in terms of Adam
[1:28:22] and Eve now when Adam was created and
[1:28:25] Eve was taken from him as a byproduct
[1:28:27] nobody had to send Eve maybe over into
[1:28:30] the east side of Eden into a great big
[1:28:33] spot where they had leaves and things
[1:28:35] kind of built to go to wife's School
[1:28:37] and nobody had to teach her how to be
[1:28:40] submissive to her husband she was I'll
[1:28:43] say the word created but she was formed
[1:28:45] as we know as a byproduct she was formed
[1:28:48] in a manner that she already had within
[1:28:51] her the ability to know how to submit to
[1:28:54] Adam remember she was made in such a way
[1:28:57] that not only did she submit to the
[1:28:59] level of obedience and what maybe Adam
[1:29:02] would want or desire but even her own
[1:29:05] name reflected that submission because
[1:29:08] remember Eve was not given to her until
[1:29:10] after the fall if you'd have said the
[1:29:12] Bible of course says that their name was
[1:29:14] Adam so if you just said hey Adam both
[1:29:16] of them want to turn around and said hey
[1:29:18] it's me too because she was all that was
[1:29:21] the first metoo movement by the way and
[1:29:24] that really brings it back to the bride
[1:29:26] of Christ which was originally not named
[1:29:29] Pentecost Methodist Baptist this that
[1:29:32] and the other but she was under the
[1:29:34] identity of Jesus Christ from the very
[1:29:37] found foundation of the world you say
[1:29:39] how the prophet in 1959 tells us and of
[1:29:42] a message called we're not why we're not
[1:29:44] a denomination that when the lamb was
[1:29:46] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:29:48] now when he was slain the blood of
[1:29:50] Christ was taken from his body and wrote
[1:29:52] on the Lamb's Book of Life all of the
[1:29:55] names remember your name didn't go on
[1:29:56] the other day you got saved the day you
[1:29:58] recognized Christ the day that you
[1:30:00] wanted to get saved but the reason that
[1:30:02] you even felt that way was because
[1:30:04] before there was a son a moon a star a
[1:30:07] speck of Stardust or planets or anything
[1:30:09] else your name was wrote on God's book
[1:30:12] associated with the lamb brother Graham
[1:30:15] said the first name that went on that
[1:30:17] book was the name of Jesus Christ then
[1:30:20] every name subsequently thereafter was
[1:30:23] placed upon that book wrote In the Blood
[1:30:25] of Jesus Christ which is by the way the
[1:30:28] reason why that the devil if he could
[1:30:30] ever cross that bloodline he would be my
[1:30:32] brother because not only is my name and
[1:30:35] my identity with the lamb but is it's
[1:30:38] wrote In the Blood of Jesus Christ now
[1:30:41] looking at the the unfolding of all of
[1:30:44] the characteristics of God look at the
[1:30:47] feminist part of Eve remember when God
[1:30:50] reaches into Adam and pulls out of his
[1:30:52] human spirit that feminist part this was
[1:30:55] not something separate from Adam this
[1:30:57] was a part of Adam in the beginning
[1:30:59] their Spirits were Blended together they
[1:31:02] were one they were in Oneness and now
[1:31:05] that blending is occurring in two
[1:31:07] different bodies but remember it wasn't
[1:31:09] so much that Eve somehow when she left
[1:31:13] the word it wasn't so much that I don't
[1:31:15] know how to say this exactly maybe the
[1:31:17] Lord helped me say this right but it
[1:31:19] wasn't so much that uh you know that
[1:31:21] when she fell that all of that went away
[1:31:23] I know a lot of people got this in their
[1:31:25] mind that when Eve fell in the Garden of
[1:31:27] Eden all of the good things about a
[1:31:28] person disappeared and they're true the
[1:31:31] Bible said that the tree that they
[1:31:33] partook of was not just a tree of evil
[1:31:35] but remember it was also a tree of good
[1:31:37] as well the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:31:39] and Evil and even the prophet said a
[1:31:42] message called Blasphemous names that
[1:31:44] there can be characteristics in the
[1:31:47] human nature that would be similar to
[1:31:49] the nature so The Virtue uh the nature
[1:31:51] of the virtues of Christ he said some
[1:31:53] could be more patient some could be more
[1:31:55] temperate some could have that something
[1:31:57] about them that seems Godly in a natural
[1:32:00] way but it's not really the natural part
[1:32:03] uh the the spiritual part of Christ it's
[1:32:05] more of a natural passing down of
[1:32:07] goodness and good things that follow
[1:32:10] around families and uh down through
[1:32:12] generations like that now don't forget
[1:32:14] that when when Eve found all of the same
[1:32:17] characteristics of submission still laid
[1:32:19] within her just the same as it was with
[1:32:21] Adam and the prophet identifies it this
[1:32:24] way he said what is the Son of God he
[1:32:26] said in his State as he is now in his
[1:32:28] Fallen condition he said he is just an
[1:32:31] undone creation of God that is dominated
[1:32:34] by the devil so in other words he has
[1:32:37] all of the same potentials that he's
[1:32:39] always had but it's now dominated by
[1:32:42] Satan and friends that's what the
[1:32:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost does for you
[1:32:45] and I it gives us the ability to move
[1:32:48] Satan away from that place of control so
[1:32:51] that we can now rule over the sin that
[1:32:55] once ruled us a nature of that
[1:32:57] personality all those things that
[1:32:59] trouble you so much the Holy Ghost gives
[1:33:02] you power over that remember it's the
[1:33:04] same thing on the other side of it being
[1:33:06] born again doesn't change this right
[1:33:08] here all of the bad stuff that lays
[1:33:11] inside of you all of the temper and the
[1:33:13] fighting and the bickering and the
[1:33:14] whatever else might be heightening your
[1:33:16] cells all of that is still there but
[1:33:19] remember said my conversion never took
[1:33:21] out of me my love for the woods he said
[1:33:23] I've always been a Woodsman a lover of
[1:33:24] nature he said even my conversion didn't
[1:33:26] take that out of me so there are places
[1:33:28] in us that are very good places in us
[1:33:32] that are very bad but God created the
[1:33:35] human being in such a manner that all of
[1:33:38] those characteristics will remain even
[1:33:40] you take some women
[1:33:42] that don't know that nothing about
[1:33:44] church that never named The Name of
[1:33:45] Christ they've never gone but you watch
[1:33:47] them they they're good moral type people
[1:33:49] that have been raised in the type of
[1:33:51] family to show respect to give honor
[1:33:53] where honor is due and even a natural
[1:33:55] woman without a speck of the baptism of
[1:33:57] the Holy Ghost has that something about
[1:33:59] her to submit to somebody and this is
[1:34:02] where it gets trouble uh when you get
[1:34:04] into the side about a woman that just
[1:34:06] chases and chases and chases looking for
[1:34:08] that one person to kind of settle her
[1:34:10] and then she doesn't find it there so
[1:34:12] she runs to the next one so don't find
[1:34:14] it there she runs to the next one the
[1:34:15] next one the next one and what it is
[1:34:17] deep within her is this call or this
[1:34:20] place that God that is something that
[1:34:22] God placed within her to want to be
[1:34:24] submissive to the man don't want to
[1:34:26] submit herself to a leader and to submit
[1:34:29] herself to leadership and what a thing
[1:34:31] the devil has done in this last day by
[1:34:33] honing in on the women's rights and the
[1:34:36] women's Liberation and women's
[1:34:37] empowerment and he tries to focus that
[1:34:40] woman that listen you don't need a man
[1:34:42] you you don't need it it's impossible
[1:34:44] for you to succeed while this guy's
[1:34:47] lording over you and actually that's
[1:34:49] what the devil has told a big lie you
[1:34:51] see a man and a woman that knows their
[1:34:53] positions and knows how God made them
[1:34:56] and can work together in Tandem and work
[1:34:59] together as a one unit as a team they
[1:35:02] fight together they laugh together they
[1:35:04] love together they fail together they
[1:35:06] succeed together that is one of the most
[1:35:09] powerful units that has ever been seen
[1:35:12] on the face of the Earth amen it is the
[1:35:15] very backbone of every assembly every
[1:35:18] church every place every person here
[1:35:20] today is a part of a family unit in some
[1:35:22] way or another
[1:35:24] let a man start breaking that let a
[1:35:26] woman start getting out of that position
[1:35:27] and watch and see how it sends shock
[1:35:30] waves to a church
[1:35:31] let a man or woman get caught up in
[1:35:33] drugs or adultery or some kind of a sex
[1:35:36] sin or some kind of a A thieving type
[1:35:38] thing they get caught lying or they get
[1:35:39] caught look at how that one little thing
[1:35:42] sends a shock name not just through one
[1:35:44] assembly but thanks to Facebook and the
[1:35:46] rest of the social media and buying
[1:35:47] their brother knows it by midnight so
[1:35:49] there we have a conglomeration if you
[1:35:52] will of a family is setting you know in
[1:35:55] churches this Patriarchs and matriarchs
[1:35:57] isn't it I mean you look and you think
[1:35:59] uh most of our Memphis churches are made
[1:36:01] up uh maybe one or two families that
[1:36:04] they come there many years ago and then
[1:36:06] you've got this son and that daughter
[1:36:08] and they're married to this family and
[1:36:09] they're married to that one they got
[1:36:11] grandkids and cousins and it's all kind
[1:36:13] of associated together and the family
[1:36:16] unit is the strongest part of the church
[1:36:19] not the single people and those that are
[1:36:22] in bad situations merrily aren't strong
[1:36:24] but I mean what kind of strength can be
[1:36:28] shown by a man and woman that can hold
[1:36:30] themselves right live right before the
[1:36:32] Lord and live in a place to where they
[1:36:34] can project that relationship upon the
[1:36:37] rest of the church when you see families
[1:36:39] many times that the husband's always at
[1:36:41] a life and the wife is always at the
[1:36:43] husband and people they call it that
[1:36:45] awful isn't that terrible they're always
[1:36:47] picking at one another let me tell you
[1:36:49] something more I've been married going
[1:36:50] on 25 years Samantha and I we fuss
[1:36:53] sometimes we nitpick at each other we
[1:36:56] pick at each other we joke we Josh we
[1:36:58] laugh we cry we fuss we get angry and
[1:37:01] when we first were married we were
[1:37:02] nothing but a bunch of kids we rolled in
[1:37:04] the floor with handfuls of each other's
[1:37:06] hair screaming and throwing things and
[1:37:08] acting like a bunch of children but you
[1:37:10] know what brother Brad we did it
[1:37:11] together we've done it together if we
[1:37:13] fought together we did it if we laughed
[1:37:15] together we did it and brother that's
[1:37:17] what Jesus Christ wants us to do with
[1:37:19] him amen no matter what maybe follow us
[1:37:21] in this life no matter what might come
[1:37:24] before our doorway he wants us to do it
[1:37:26] with him laugh with him love with him
[1:37:29] fight with him and stand by the side of
[1:37:31] of Jesus watch him Stand By Your Side
[1:37:33] the same way
[1:37:35] amen young people get this idea out of
[1:37:37] your brain that marriages are made up of
[1:37:39] that stuff you're reading books and see
[1:37:40] on social media and that big Hollywood
[1:37:42] thing walking arm and arm and the sunset
[1:37:45] amen the hair blowing just so so
[1:37:48] thank God they got hair to blow at my
[1:37:50] age you start praying that God let us
[1:37:51] stay in
[1:37:53] amen some of us are fortunate for it to
[1:37:55] turn gray some of us are fortunate
[1:37:57] enough for it to turn loose
[1:38:00] come on somebody now what I'm trying to
[1:38:03] say to you is that this is what real
[1:38:05] life looks like you know it troubles me
[1:38:07] it troubles me when I see preachers in
[1:38:10] this message tried to create this
[1:38:12] spiritual Utopia of marriage that oh if
[1:38:15] you've got the Holy Ghost you'll never
[1:38:16] have a problem and you'll never have a
[1:38:18] fight you'll never have an argument what
[1:38:20] kind of imbecile is leading the church
[1:38:23] that is not reality see that is not
[1:38:26] human life and you know what happens
[1:38:28] that kind of preaching has such an
[1:38:30] influence that when the doors closed and
[1:38:32] you guys are having World War five not
[1:38:35] even three you've been skipped to five
[1:38:37] then you start feeling condemned and
[1:38:39] upset in your spirit oh oh we don't even
[1:38:41] have the Holy Ghost no Holy Ghost filled
[1:38:43] people fight
[1:38:46] three-eyed three eye blinks two head
[1:38:48] nods and a couple amens
[1:38:51] right brothers and sisters argue
[1:38:54] husbands and wives fight
[1:38:56] people in the church disagree with one
[1:38:58] another the word say man in case you
[1:39:00] forgot it
[1:39:01] right we preach such a a standard of oh
[1:39:05] one of these days we'll reach such a
[1:39:07] plateau in God that will never have
[1:39:09] another argument I don't know if you've
[1:39:11] been smoking and funny cigarettes or not
[1:39:12] smelling some kind of chemical in the
[1:39:15] air where you were but that is not
[1:39:16] reality
[1:39:18] the reality is this my friends that
[1:39:21] you'll have all of those kind of things
[1:39:23] in your life but the Holy Ghost will
[1:39:25] bring you to such a plate of growth to
[1:39:27] where you'll know how to repent quickly
[1:39:29] you know how to straighten the mess up
[1:39:31] you'll know how to move on immaturity
[1:39:33] and walk like a son and a daughter of
[1:39:36] God
[1:39:36] ought to do when they mess up and the
[1:39:39] church said amen
[1:39:41] right but that lays in the heart I hear
[1:39:44] young people young people all the time
[1:39:46] talking about how that they struggle
[1:39:48] with different things everything from
[1:39:49] sex to music to you name it and and the
[1:39:52] reason they struggle is because deep in
[1:39:54] their heart they want to live right but
[1:39:56] if we're not careful by the time I'm
[1:39:57] afraid what we've done is preach such a
[1:40:00] manifested Utopia of the spiritual parts
[1:40:03] of God that we have forgotten how to
[1:40:05] teach them to be young people how to
[1:40:07] teach them that they are going to have
[1:40:09] days they're so confused that they don't
[1:40:11] know which way is
[1:40:12] it's up and down they are going to have
[1:40:15] sexual battles and they're not going to
[1:40:17] know how to how to how to deal with it
[1:40:18] or how to approach it they are going to
[1:40:21] succumb to Temptations and girls will be
[1:40:23] tempted to do this and boys be tempted
[1:40:25] to do that brother the key is not to
[1:40:28] take their Humanity away from them but
[1:40:30] to show them how to surrender to the
[1:40:32] hands of the Lord so that God can help
[1:40:35] them whip all of that Lydia see and mess
[1:40:38] somebody say Amen
[1:40:40] right because we've heard this our whole
[1:40:44] life don't look at me that way I was
[1:40:45] raised to this message
[1:40:46] I've been in this message since I was
[1:40:48] born I know how our preachers have
[1:40:50] preached I know how our people have told
[1:40:51] us oh you get God in your life all of
[1:40:55] that goes away and why ain't it gone
[1:40:56] away in his life
[1:40:58] because I guarantee you by the end of
[1:41:00] the day you could pull the book on that
[1:41:01] portray be just as guilty as you are
[1:41:03] about everything else he tells you not
[1:41:05] to do
[1:41:07] amen
[1:41:08] listen friends our Prophet didn't keep a
[1:41:10] cross hanging in his car because he
[1:41:12] believed he was an angel
[1:41:14] our Prophet didn't have brothers around
[1:41:16] him all the time out in meetings like
[1:41:18] that gone three months of the clip with
[1:41:20] from his wife and family and them
[1:41:21] because he thought that he was some holy
[1:41:23] you know some holy uh uh uh infallible
[1:41:27] Prophet that could never succumb to
[1:41:28] temptation
[1:41:30] other man knew what kind of man he was
[1:41:32] he knew what kind of person he was he
[1:41:34] knew his weaknesses and he knew his
[1:41:36] strengths and knew how to cover himself
[1:41:38] that's the key by the way that he could
[1:41:41] overcome in every situation that would
[1:41:43] come by him
[1:41:45] you think Brothers didn't get offended
[1:41:46] you think there were times he didn't
[1:41:48] want to grab somebody by the nape of
[1:41:49] their neck and throw them out of the
[1:41:50] church
[1:41:51] you think we're taught listen to him
[1:41:53] sometimes when he's preaching one time
[1:41:55] he was going on and he was just laying
[1:41:57] into some of these preachers and these
[1:41:58] people about the way they treat the Lord
[1:42:00] in church he said some of the stupidest
[1:42:02] he's excused me for that that's a little
[1:42:04] bit too strong let me say that
[1:42:05] differently
[1:42:07] that proves to me when you hear things
[1:42:08] like that brother bam understood what
[1:42:10] reality of humanity looked like
[1:42:12] this is like in sicknesses we go through
[1:42:15] these physical battles in our body and
[1:42:18] then immediately immediately we start
[1:42:21] questioning whether we're even Sons and
[1:42:22] Daughters of God because we've got this
[1:42:25] belief in our mind that if I'm a
[1:42:27] born-again Christian I should be the
[1:42:29] picture of Health look around
[1:42:32] if I started asking right now how many
[1:42:34] of you here take high blood pressure
[1:42:35] pills
[1:42:38] if I started asking how many is on
[1:42:40] insulin how many has to see a doctor
[1:42:41] twice a year for this how many has that
[1:42:43] blood work for that every person in here
[1:42:46] would have to raise their hand to some
[1:42:48] kind of Affliction or ailment in some
[1:42:50] way or another and for you that are the
[1:42:52] picture of Health don't sell me your
[1:42:54] vitamins after church I've got my own
[1:42:56] little regimen
[1:42:58] unless it's Brother Floyd then I want to
[1:43:00] know the secret
[1:43:00] [Laughter]
[1:43:04] the thing that I'm saying is that we got
[1:43:06] to understand what Christianity
[1:43:09] how it's really designed
[1:43:15] because you take a person that enters
[1:43:18] into this wall Brethren tells us and
[1:43:20] there's many places I could read I'm
[1:43:21] trying to omit the reading
[1:43:23] but the thing that we've got to
[1:43:25] understand is how many times the prophet
[1:43:27] would say just type in some time flowery
[1:43:28] bed of ease
[1:43:31] let's look again how many times brother
[1:43:32] Adam said some people try to present
[1:43:34] Christianity like it's a flowery bed of
[1:43:36] these
[1:43:38] you know why he's saying that because
[1:43:39] the preachers of his time and those
[1:43:41] evangelists and those leaders in his
[1:43:43] time were telling everybody come to
[1:43:45] Christ and don't Prosper greater than
[1:43:47] you better prospered
[1:43:49] I can tell by the look on some of
[1:43:51] y'all's faces even without my glasses I
[1:43:53] can tell that you don't believe that
[1:43:59] and the church age but the prophet said
[1:44:01] the majority of God's people are poor
[1:44:02] people
[1:44:04] some of you right now struggle from
[1:44:06] paycheck to paycheck to paycheck
[1:44:10] but here's what the devil tells you and
[1:44:12] the preachers leaders spiritual people
[1:44:15] in the church
[1:44:16] what glory to God if you were living
[1:44:19] where you should Hallelujah you shut
[1:44:21] money running out of your ears
[1:44:23] I learned a long time ago don't take
[1:44:25] advice from broke people
[1:44:33] and just because their didn't mean
[1:44:34] they always got it honestly
[1:44:37] sometimes listen I'm a business major
[1:44:39] and I met a lot of these business folk
[1:44:40] and I hear
[1:44:42] their stories in the lunchrooms and that
[1:44:44] said that when the maybe I should stop
[1:44:47] there
[1:44:50] I can understand what their deal is
[1:44:52] they'll step on anybody
[1:44:55] that undercut the mother if it took that
[1:44:57] to get a get a get a buck in there
[1:45:00] that's not necessarily because God gave
[1:45:02] him the wealth
[1:45:03] they just took whatever skills that God
[1:45:05] gave them they used it for the wrong
[1:45:07] thing
[1:45:09] right being wealthy is something that if
[1:45:11] God puts a lot of money in your hands
[1:45:12] you know why God give you that money to
[1:45:14] take care of your family and to give
[1:45:16] from the abundance of your receiving to
[1:45:18] the other ones that need the help and
[1:45:20] the grace and that's where rich people
[1:45:22] usually fall off the wagon I'll give my
[1:45:24] money to somebody else that's what Paul
[1:45:26] said if you believe the Bible he said
[1:45:28] give to those like
[1:45:31] maybe I should take up an offering right
[1:45:33] now
[1:45:37] do you understand why a lot of this
[1:45:40] stuff has been propagated around the
[1:45:42] message just because
[1:45:44] people have missed the key element of
[1:45:46] all of this
[1:45:48] it's not about what you can do
[1:45:51] it's about how you can surrender
[1:45:57] I mean think about it for us to sit down
[1:45:59] right now with a tape recorder and let's
[1:46:01] just make it like a little room type
[1:46:03] thing like brother I'm running them
[1:46:04] through the roof each one sits here with
[1:46:06] us ministers
[1:46:07] gives your story let's say we give you
[1:46:08] 10 minutes to give your story
[1:46:11] could you imagine after it was all those
[1:46:13] 10 minutes was collected about what
[1:46:15] maybe 100 people said you know what your
[1:46:16] number is
[1:46:17] you take all of their stories right down
[1:46:19] to the littlest one you might walk in
[1:46:21] the door and say I was playing my toys
[1:46:23] and my brother bought my toy okay all
[1:46:24] them stories
[1:46:26] imagine how different they're all gonna
[1:46:28] sound
[1:46:29] imagine the variety that consists in all
[1:46:33] of those stories like that
[1:46:35] and yet God gave us a one-size-fits-all
[1:46:40] answer Glory Brother Brad
[1:46:43] that is surrender
[1:46:45] you see this is where the devil tries to
[1:46:47] take people and measure them against one
[1:46:49] another
[1:46:50] so you see your background maybe sister
[1:46:52] you're someone that didn't have your
[1:46:54] virtue when you went to the Altar and
[1:46:56] maybe you were somebody that slept
[1:46:57] around or was a party girl or you had
[1:46:59] some guy like I don't have to be you
[1:47:00] women here today I mean just around the
[1:47:02] message in general
[1:47:03] let's say you come to your husband you
[1:47:05] confess them things out made it right
[1:47:07] and all come to the altar with no
[1:47:08] unresolved issues and everything was
[1:47:10] known and he confessed to you the same
[1:47:12] way you confessed to him
[1:47:16] don't forget there's always two sides to
[1:47:18] that goal
[1:47:20] nobody needs to find out about a
[1:47:22] girlfriend that they used to have seven
[1:47:24] months after they've been married that
[1:47:25] needs to be said seven months before the
[1:47:27] marriage
[1:47:28] come on
[1:47:32] I see sister Laura's sitting out there
[1:47:35] I I had a I have a sweet on Amy Laura's
[1:47:39] sister years ago
[1:47:40] and uh we went to church together one
[1:47:43] time and you know just really really far
[1:47:45] apart and you know even had to call long
[1:47:48] distance and things like that you know
[1:47:49] as a 16 year old 17 year old boy it
[1:47:51] wasn't really in the cars for me number
[1:47:54] one I didn't have enough money to make
[1:47:55] all them phone calls and it just didn't
[1:47:57] work out but I liked Amy I still like
[1:47:59] him I think she's a good girl
[1:48:02] but I didn't hardly even say hello to
[1:48:05] Samantha but I wasn't ready to start
[1:48:07] telling her about all of the girlfriends
[1:48:09] and the people and whoever and all that
[1:48:11] it's a very short list relax
[1:48:20] I know some of you boys would probably
[1:48:21] take a few days to get that thing out
[1:48:23] you're going to need a
[1:48:28] but that's the honesty of the thing
[1:48:30] right
[1:48:33] let me move into something else it all
[1:48:35] comes to surrender no matter what the
[1:48:38] background is
[1:48:39] you get the point I'm trying to make
[1:48:42] Paul even said it about the Pharisees
[1:48:44] measuring themselves against themselves
[1:48:46] that are not wise
[1:48:50] then somebody might say yeah I sat with
[1:48:52] a few ministers one time
[1:48:55] I was about maybe
[1:48:57] 25 26 something like that so it's been
[1:48:59] about 20 years ago
[1:49:00] and I was sitting there in this one old
[1:49:03] boy he said well you don't know nothing
[1:49:05] about the world do you because I started
[1:49:07] preaching at 14 the Lord Sanctified me
[1:49:09] at a young age and you know and and the
[1:49:11] Reason God did it is because he knew how
[1:49:13] Wild I was
[1:49:16] kind of got me earlier I'd have been a
[1:49:17] mess at all
[1:49:19] he got me early not because that makes
[1:49:21] me more holy
[1:49:22] holy he got me because I'd have been
[1:49:23] more Unholy than holy
[1:49:26] oh yeah I'm a norob through and through
[1:49:27] and our people were wild men
[1:49:29] Nordic it comes to the NORAD it comes
[1:49:31] from Nordic which is Vikings imagine any
[1:49:33] kind of History you hear about the
[1:49:34] Viking there I am
[1:49:41] you know I never dragged never smoked
[1:49:42] you know my brother used expression the
[1:49:46] first kiss at the altar yep I understand
[1:49:47] all that
[1:49:49] doesn't make me nothing
[1:49:52] does the Lord put me in that position so
[1:49:53] I could preach and do what I'm doing
[1:49:56] and these brothers you don't know
[1:49:58] nothing about smoking do you you don't
[1:50:00] know nothing about running to bars do
[1:50:01] you and they're such a made fun of me
[1:50:03] for 45 minutes
[1:50:04] while they sat and bragged about all the
[1:50:06] bars they run to and all the women they
[1:50:08] slept with and all the drugs they did
[1:50:10] and I thought maybe perhaps you've done
[1:50:12] a few too many drugs because you've
[1:50:14] almost sound like your brain ain't
[1:50:15] working too well sitting here
[1:50:21] just bragging about something like that
[1:50:22] to me that's not a badge of honor
[1:50:24] to me that's things that you understand
[1:50:26] and say God thank you for delivering me
[1:50:28] from that stupidity
[1:50:32] brag about
[1:50:34] you know when we talk to our kids you
[1:50:36] know we try to tell our kids glory to
[1:50:37] God I used to be the biggest on if
[1:50:39] he'd be just hold still Old Faithful
[1:50:41] keep that stuff in there
[1:50:44] testify to him about how God can deliver
[1:50:46] you
[1:50:48] don't go through all of the details I
[1:50:49] don't need to know that stuff
[1:50:51] besides your mama if I was a kid I
[1:50:53] wouldn't want to hear my mama talking
[1:50:54] that way
[1:50:58] but all of those varieties of
[1:51:00] backgrounds imagine what every story
[1:51:02] would be like if you just
[1:51:04] get up here and play it one time
[1:51:08] and somebody might say well glory to God
[1:51:10] I'll have you know I was and then
[1:51:13] somebody come along and say well I was
[1:51:14] raised in the message and I really don't
[1:51:16] know much you know and
[1:51:18] there's somebody see you there you don't
[1:51:21] know nothing about the grace of God
[1:51:22] don't you ever say that
[1:51:25] especially for our young people raised
[1:51:27] to this message some of you older ones
[1:51:28] listen to brother Ben don't you ever
[1:51:31] believe because you come out of
[1:51:33] Pentecost Methodist Baptist don't you
[1:51:34] ever believe that our kids have not had
[1:51:36] to overcome just as many if not more
[1:51:38] denominational Spirits than you did
[1:51:41] they've been exposed to everything
[1:51:43] not by the baller's fault not just
[1:51:45] preacher's fault I don't mean that but
[1:51:47] they've been exposed to everything from
[1:51:48] Facebook to Twitter you name it uh
[1:51:50] people they go to camps with people that
[1:51:52] they go and associate in special
[1:51:53] meetings with they bring all their
[1:51:55] baggage with them when they go to them
[1:51:57] camps
[1:51:59] that's why you better know before you
[1:52:01] make moves like that you better know
[1:52:02] you're sending your kid into the right
[1:52:04] place strong enough to be able to
[1:52:05] withstand some of them secret private
[1:52:07] conversations in them cabins well ain't
[1:52:09] nobody looking
[1:52:11] amen
[1:52:13] I know I got girls of my own
[1:52:16] I know how it is I hear the stories they
[1:52:19] tell
[1:52:19] one young lady come back from the camp
[1:52:21] told my wife she said how discouraged
[1:52:24] she was because every girl in the in the
[1:52:26] cabin was standing down there and one of
[1:52:28] the big dorm rooms that every one of
[1:52:30] them was putting their makeup on getting
[1:52:31] ready to go to church
[1:52:33] I'm talking about kids born in the
[1:52:35] message raised in the message don't you
[1:52:37] ever think
[1:52:38] because you come from the outside in
[1:52:39] that you got you had more to overcome
[1:52:41] than them actually they're the ones that
[1:52:44] have more to overcome than you did
[1:52:47] because it's obvious to see when you're
[1:52:49] a part of trinitarian church it's
[1:52:50] obvious to see once you see the Oneness
[1:52:52] of the godhead what the better version
[1:52:54] was
[1:52:58] right
[1:53:00] but when you've been raised here in
[1:53:02] brother Ramset brother Brian said the
[1:53:03] Bible said brother Madison the prophet
[1:53:05] said
[1:53:06] you talk confusing
[1:53:08] it takes the Holy Ghost to discern all
[1:53:10] of that
[1:53:11] to lay it out plainly before you to show
[1:53:14] you what is truth and what is not truth
[1:53:16] and sometimes it's such a fine line a
[1:53:18] razor blade line between some of them
[1:53:20] elements you don't really know which way
[1:53:21] is up and which way is down
[1:53:24] listen brother it took me 10 years I was
[1:53:26] raised in a church that said you know
[1:53:27] many of you know this I was raised in a
[1:53:29] church that was leaning toward return
[1:53:31] Ministry for many years and it was about
[1:53:32] time I was married whenever the pastor
[1:53:34] come full blown with brother Brown
[1:53:35] coming back setting up a tent nobody had
[1:53:38] the Holy Ghost but the prophet we can't
[1:53:39] even get rapture and faith
[1:53:41] going through a little room on and on
[1:53:43] and on and on you talk about confusing
[1:53:47] this is the same man I watched pack a
[1:53:50] little bible in his pocket
[1:53:52] and knew the Bible so well you could
[1:53:54] start a verse and without even looking
[1:53:56] he could wreaking finish quoting it and
[1:53:58] tell you everywhere the prophet said
[1:54:00] associated with it
[1:54:02] humble lived a good life a Godly life
[1:54:07] with just that little bit of something
[1:54:08] in there is just enough to confuse you
[1:54:11] that if you don't have the mercy of God
[1:54:13] in your life and if you don't seek for
[1:54:14] the leadership of the Lord my young
[1:54:16] friends you listen to me you've been
[1:54:17] raised this message if you don't have
[1:54:18] that in your life you talk about
[1:54:19] confusing
[1:54:21] and when they jump on these websites and
[1:54:23] they see the Bergens and the Collins boy
[1:54:25] out there throwing all that stuff before
[1:54:26] them by the time see it seems like more
[1:54:28] clarity to them
[1:54:30] all them guys are doing is they are
[1:54:33] honing in on supply and demand
[1:54:36] there is a demand for people to see
[1:54:39] something different
[1:54:41] they've supplied something different
[1:54:44] many of the folks that run after these
[1:54:46] websites and these false things about
[1:54:48] brother random stop and think for a
[1:54:49] minute who you're talking to
[1:54:52] now this is public knowledge I'm not
[1:54:54] saying this behind us back a Collins boy
[1:54:57] was thrown out by Wilbur Collins brother
[1:54:58] Collins for sexual indiscretion turned
[1:55:01] over to the devil
[1:55:02] you want him as your Authority
[1:55:05] go back and look at the lives of these
[1:55:07] men they've made themselves public go
[1:55:08] back look at them how many Devils have
[1:55:10] they cast out how many sermons have they
[1:55:12] preached how many people have they led
[1:55:14] to Christ in the ways they've done
[1:55:16] those are the authorities but you see
[1:55:19] people run after that because they're so
[1:55:21] confused about themselves
[1:55:25] and our leadership has done nothing I
[1:55:27] mean I can't say we into nothing we've
[1:55:29] done nothing to really settle the people
[1:55:31] into this idea that that stuff is going
[1:55:34] to be out there and yes you're going to
[1:55:36] see confusion in your own ranks
[1:55:40] but in all of that mess there's going to
[1:55:42] be a truth laying in there somewhere
[1:55:45] that if you'll just surrender yourself
[1:55:47] to the word of God
[1:55:49] and to the will and the leadership of
[1:55:51] the Lord watch God just spread all that
[1:55:53] mess lie open in the Red Sea and show
[1:55:55] you what is thus saith the Lord if you
[1:55:57] want to know it's there for you to know
[1:56:00] amen hallelujah
[1:56:02] my sheep will hear my voice and a
[1:56:05] stranger they will follow amen
[1:56:08] but the ministry of surrender this is
[1:56:10] where we've got to know
[1:56:14] I've got the ability to surrender to him
[1:56:16] no matter what my past looks like
[1:56:18] no one of my back no matter what the
[1:56:20] background may be I've got the ability
[1:56:22] to surrender to him and all of that
[1:56:24] makes up his bouquet
[1:56:25] there's going to be some people standing
[1:56:27] on the other side and be able to declare
[1:56:29] I was a drunk and God delivered me I was
[1:56:31] this I got delivered me I was that God
[1:56:33] delivered me and they're going to be
[1:56:34] some people that was raised in this
[1:56:35] truth to be able to say I was associated
[1:56:37] with all kinds of confusion and the Lord
[1:56:40] brought Clarity to my soul and mine
[1:56:44] now let's turn to First Peter chapter 5
[1:56:46] verse 5.
[1:56:49] can I go a little bit further
[1:56:52] thank you appreciate it I know some of
[1:56:54] you probably feel like I'm just getting
[1:56:55] started but we've been going 45 minutes
[1:56:56] already
[1:56:59] the anointing will do that for you
[1:57:01] hopefully the naughty will stay for at
[1:57:02] least 30 more minutes
[1:57:05] praise the Lord now listen
[1:57:08] First Peter chapter 5 verse five
[1:57:10] likewise she younger submit yourself
[1:57:12] unto the Elder
[1:57:14] yay all of you repeat that with me all
[1:57:18] of you
[1:57:20] be subject one to another
[1:57:22] be clothed with humility for God resists
[1:57:27] the proud you don't want God resisting
[1:57:30] you
[1:57:32] a lot of people in this world if they
[1:57:35] turn their nose up at you that's one
[1:57:36] thing but you don't want God resisting
[1:57:39] you
[1:57:41] when your creator turns his nose up at
[1:57:43] you that's a bad thing
[1:57:45] bad
[1:57:46] very bad
[1:57:49] gives grace to the humble how many wants
[1:57:51] Grace
[1:57:53] he gives it to the humble now not this
[1:57:55] false humility you know how people are
[1:57:57] I'm just an old spare time
[1:58:00] yeah we know
[1:58:04] humble yourselves therefore under the
[1:58:06] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[1:58:10] in due time
[1:58:12] now notice this a message the meanest
[1:58:14] man in Santa Maria says when Rebecca
[1:58:16] came to meet Isaac did you notice she
[1:58:17] veiled her face
[1:58:20] he said that they'll still do it today
[1:58:22] he said they don't know what they're
[1:58:23] doing he said but the bride
[1:58:25] veils her face why
[1:58:28] the man is her head the nature of a
[1:58:30] woman is to yield to a man that's the
[1:58:31] reason the church should be veiled it's
[1:58:33] got a head that's Christ so here Peter
[1:58:36] is saying be failed
[1:58:38] with what humility
[1:58:41] now listen for his false humility that
[1:58:43] we see in the ranks of this message it
[1:58:46] God help me say this it makes me so sick
[1:58:48] to my stomach I feel like puking all
[1:58:49] over the floor
[1:58:51] I get so aggravated to people sometimes
[1:58:52] I get aggravated me too don't think I
[1:58:54] don't
[1:58:55] but I get aggravated to people you know
[1:58:57] you somebody sings a song or something
[1:58:58] and you know you said man I like that
[1:59:00] song man that was good
[1:59:02] I just
[1:59:08] just be gracious just be honest thank
[1:59:11] you I appreciate that that really helps
[1:59:13] me
[1:59:17] God ain't looking for false humility
[1:59:20] about to put on trying to be humble
[1:59:24] that's why I told you some weeks ago
[1:59:27] preaching here at the church some some
[1:59:28] months ago you look at our girls they
[1:59:30] all look the same flat shoes same type
[1:59:32] of hairstyle same type of dresses I'm
[1:59:34] not saying that we don't need holiness
[1:59:36] but if we ain't careful we're going to
[1:59:38] reach a spot where we're going to be
[1:59:39] manufacturing it
[1:59:41] rather than seeing individuality amongst
[1:59:44] the masses
[1:59:46] God doesn't want us to be a manufactured
[1:59:48] bride go back in the message look up
[1:59:50] manufactured sometime
[1:59:52] they're manufacturing the latter rain he
[1:59:55] said no such thing as that it's got to
[1:59:58] be something that is born out of the
[2:00:00] individual experience with Christ
[2:00:01] themselves
[2:00:03] right
[2:00:05] there's one man one time was just
[2:00:06] burning these women up for curling their
[2:00:08] hair
[2:00:09] glory to God if you had the Holy Ghost
[2:00:11] you girls wouldn't curl your hair you're
[2:00:13] just wanting a man
[2:00:15] stupidest thing I've ever heard my I
[2:00:17] thought man wake up
[2:00:19] she's a girl
[2:00:21] girls want to curl their hair I'm just
[2:00:24] rejoicing the boys don't
[2:00:30] praise the Lord
[2:00:35] but this is what I'm saying we have made
[2:00:37] Christianity an element of something
[2:00:40] that we do and if you read the Bible at
[2:00:44] all
[2:00:45] you can't offer him nothing
[2:00:49] if you do the minute you offer him
[2:00:51] something
[2:00:52] listen carefully the minute you offer
[2:00:56] him something
[2:00:58] you are trading law and Grace
[2:01:01] [Music]
[2:01:03] because there's nothing that you and I
[2:01:05] can do as Sons and Daughters of God to
[2:01:06] ever Merit the salvation and the mercy
[2:01:08] and the grace and the righteousness of
[2:01:10] God God somebody preached to me
[2:01:12] nothing we can do to marry you can live
[2:01:14] holy every day of your life have your
[2:01:16] sins forgiven and thrown as fire as the
[2:01:18] East is from the West you can be
[2:01:20] absolutely committed to the Lord in
[2:01:22] every way and still go to hell
[2:01:26] this is not a matter of how how much do
[2:01:28] I can do how much can I offer he's never
[2:01:31] asked us for that
[2:01:33] he's only asked us to
[2:01:37] sir
[2:01:39] give over
[2:01:42] to Jesus
[2:01:45] I know what I'm getting ready to say is
[2:01:46] going to be controversial
[2:01:50] but it Bears to say because it's true
[2:01:54] in our message we have movements we've
[2:01:56] all had them
[2:01:58] where people think salvation especially
[2:02:00] for the young people
[2:02:02] it's about coming into altar screaming
[2:02:04] and running and laying on the floor and
[2:02:06] crying
[2:02:07] let me tell you something friends
[2:02:10] it would do my heart good
[2:02:13] to see my babies sprawled on the floor
[2:02:15] crying tears out of their eyes screaming
[2:02:16] the name of Jesus
[2:02:18] and throw me to death as a daddy throw
[2:02:21] my heart better than anything I can
[2:02:22] think of
[2:02:24] but as a preacher
[2:02:26] for right now 31 years around the world
[2:02:28] I've watched him do it not my girls not
[2:02:30] the people I've watched people do it
[2:02:32] and in six months not a thing
[2:02:35] change in their life
[2:02:39] I know what I'm getting ready to say is
[2:02:40] controversial and I'm not trying to say
[2:02:42] this in a way to throw out emotion
[2:02:45] we believe anybody knows me at all
[2:02:48] knows that I believe in worshiping the
[2:02:50] Lord and being an emotional person and
[2:02:52] shouting and praising the Lord and if
[2:02:54] God shout you then God shouts you if God
[2:02:56] cries with any cries and thank God he
[2:02:58] does it
[2:03:01] but there will be many of our young
[2:03:02] people in this message receive new birth
[2:03:06] that may not make a speck of emotion
[2:03:12] if we're not careful we'll be critical
[2:03:14] of that
[2:03:16] way we got it yes but they wasn't raised
[2:03:18] in the same atmosphere you were raised
[2:03:20] in
[2:03:23] when Matt and Laura and I come into the
[2:03:24] truth and we started coming to the Lord
[2:03:27] amongst our young people of that
[2:03:29] generation not just for 25 years 30
[2:03:31] years now
[2:03:32] the people of that generation were very
[2:03:34] emotional all their calls and running
[2:03:36] and dancing and screaming that was the
[2:03:39] kind of environment that we were born
[2:03:40] under
[2:03:42] was at that time many of you remember
[2:03:43] back in the late 80s and the 90s there
[2:03:45] was such a Revival type feeling amongst
[2:03:47] message people
[2:03:50] and now you got to go into a place
[2:03:52] and you've almost got to put on a clown
[2:03:54] suit and dance like a bear to get them
[2:03:56] to even say Amen
[2:03:57] they're just not enthused about nothing
[2:03:59] come on you know I'm telling you the
[2:04:00] truth
[2:04:01] I just hear me anywhere
[2:04:05] they'd lost that passion that excitement
[2:04:07] for the word of God and they don't have
[2:04:09] it like they used to the environment the
[2:04:11] atmosphere the culture has changed
[2:04:14] completely
[2:04:15] so what are we supposed to do try to
[2:04:17] revive it back up and bring the emotions
[2:04:20] back in why don't we just let God lead
[2:04:22] this thing
[2:04:24] and instead of being the type of leaders
[2:04:26] I'm not the same preachers now but
[2:04:28] leaders at home and leaders in the
[2:04:29] church how about we just say okay this
[2:04:32] is the culture of people now this is
[2:04:34] where they're at and God can use this
[2:04:36] like he can use anything else
[2:04:39] hey if he could use a rooster and he
[2:04:41] could use a donkey he can use any kind
[2:04:43] of atmosphere he can use any kind of
[2:04:45] environment
[2:04:48] so I mean you're looking at me because
[2:04:49] you don't believe that but I'm telling
[2:04:51] you the truth
[2:04:53] see that that hits our denominational
[2:04:55] Spirit we hold
[2:04:59] they get it they got to get it like I
[2:05:00] got it but they're different person than
[2:05:02] you
[2:05:04] and I believe that there'll be a group
[2:05:06] of young people
[2:05:07] they'll be completely Born Again by just
[2:05:10] simply
[2:05:11] surrendering
[2:05:13] to what they've been told their whole
[2:05:14] life
[2:05:16] as the land is taken little by little
[2:05:19] so will I believe that experience will
[2:05:21] be the same way
[2:05:23] they may not make a move in church
[2:05:26] but brother
[2:05:28] you'll catch them one night
[2:05:30] everybody's in bed lights are off you go
[2:05:32] to the hallway down to the bathroom or
[2:05:34] something of course you've scheduled it
[2:05:35] with sister I'm sure made sure
[2:05:39] got permissions and everything
[2:05:41] Sam my list is coming don't worry
[2:05:45] they're not ridiculous
[2:05:47] call them on the phone can I go to the
[2:05:48] bathroom
[2:05:49] they should have met my red-headed
[2:05:51] mother about 30 years ago
[2:05:53] yeah I'll tell him when I'm going to the
[2:05:54] bathroom all right
[2:06:00] so all of a sudden you might walk down
[2:06:02] the hallway and you'll see a light on
[2:06:05] peeking the doorway sitting there with
[2:06:07] the Bible open
[2:06:09] maybe a tape plane in the background
[2:06:12] don't overlook that
[2:06:14] don't devalue that
[2:06:17] they're learning and being led by the
[2:06:19] Lord in the culture that they're being
[2:06:21] raised in
[2:06:23] that Revival Spirit has died down to
[2:06:26] such a point to where you call a meeting
[2:06:28] now
[2:06:29] call one get the biggest preachers you
[2:06:31] know of get the get this
[2:06:33] so
[2:06:34] celebrities of the message get the most
[2:06:36] visible men you can think of
[2:06:38] bring them in
[2:06:40] all be said about 30 minutes after the
[2:06:42] church started pastors are set in the
[2:06:43] back office going I just don't know
[2:06:44] where everybody's at they usually come
[2:06:45] to these things
[2:06:49] now of course every Church ain't this
[2:06:51] way but the majority of them are
[2:06:53] people just don't support things like
[2:06:55] they used to
[2:06:57] again the culture the environment has
[2:07:00] changed
[2:07:02] as Minister we have to adapt to that I
[2:07:05] have to adapt to that I have to grow and
[2:07:07] change and I have to flex with the
[2:07:09] people I preach to so when I see young
[2:07:11] people that come up with a genuine
[2:07:13] desire to want to be in service to the
[2:07:15] Lord I don't stand there and say all
[2:07:17] right now Lord God Shake That World
[2:07:19] maybe he's already shook it if I keep my
[2:07:22] mouth shut I'd see that
[2:07:24] me grabbing them by the hair of their
[2:07:26] head and shaking them all over the
[2:07:27] platform is not evidence that God's
[2:07:30] dealing with them there's not evidence
[2:07:31] he ain't dealing with them
[2:07:34] in this day and age for someone to make
[2:07:36] a move at all
[2:07:38] is evidence that God's doing something
[2:07:41] I'll take it I don't care if it's just a
[2:07:43] little finger wiggle I'll take it
[2:07:46] I'll treat it like it was a holy ghost
[2:07:48] golly washer shot in Revival
[2:07:50] for some people and I preached to many
[2:07:53] of them for years that aren't just
[2:07:54] emotional if I see them do like that in
[2:07:56] church I've had good God that had Holy
[2:07:57] Ghost Revival tonight
[2:08:01] sometimes you've got to accept people
[2:08:04] the way they're made
[2:08:05] but around said God deals with them the
[2:08:08] way he's built to think
[2:08:10] he's an artsy type person God will deal
[2:08:12] with them through art of his musical of
[2:08:14] the music if he's acting like you're
[2:08:15] dealing through intellect
[2:08:19] wow some of you young people said how
[2:08:22] are you going to get to the right
[2:08:23] experience if in your mind you think the
[2:08:25] only way I can get there is I've got a
[2:08:27] shot and speak in tongues and run all
[2:08:28] over the place
[2:08:30] I'm so glad you come to church this
[2:08:32] morning
[2:08:34] that I got the privilege to tell you
[2:08:36] this
[2:08:38] just surrender
[2:08:42] to what you know is right to what you
[2:08:45] know is true
[2:08:47] and whatsoever things will be holy of
[2:08:49] good report
[2:08:50] virtue on and on and on
[2:08:53] surrender thank
[2:08:55] upon these things
[2:08:59] and moms and dads it's up to us leaders
[2:09:02] uncles
[2:09:03] answer who you are it's up to us to
[2:09:06] adapt as well
[2:09:08] to learn that they don't do things the
[2:09:09] way we think they should do it
[2:09:11] listen kids of this generation they got
[2:09:13] a different language than what I
[2:09:14] understand
[2:09:15] my girls come in for my school sometimes
[2:09:17] and they'll say little things to me and
[2:09:19] just cackle and laugh and I ain't got
[2:09:20] the slightest clue what they're saying
[2:09:22] to me
[2:09:28] my my middle daughter annalize come to
[2:09:30] me the other day I said something about
[2:09:31] you know some little thing of truth that
[2:09:33] it was some little you know and she
[2:09:35] looked at me she said No Cap
[2:09:38] foreign
[2:09:46] that used to be cool
[2:09:50] many years have gone out of the bridge
[2:09:51] since then
[2:09:57] so as a leader what am I supposed to do
[2:09:59] look at that and say
[2:10:01] you girls are just rotten
[2:10:04] if I love them right I've got to work
[2:10:05] with them in the capacity in which they
[2:10:07] are living in
[2:10:09] now you say but the Bible don't change
[2:10:11] the message don't change the prophet
[2:10:13] said uh-huh see there you go that right
[2:10:15] there proves you're on the wrong side of
[2:10:17] the fence already stop hitting people in
[2:10:19] the face with quotes and start thinking
[2:10:21] use the brain God give you at the same
[2:10:23] time
[2:10:24] discern the time that you're living in
[2:10:26] the hour you're living it discern the
[2:10:28] face of this of the skies and what's
[2:10:30] going on around you and know the message
[2:10:31] of God intended for another generation
[2:10:36] don't just focus on things like we have
[2:10:38] glory to God if they've got the Holy
[2:10:40] Ghost they won't have Facebook in their
[2:10:41] house maybe they will
[2:10:44] because I could go back 30 years and
[2:10:46] some of the things that you called The
[2:10:48] Devil is nothing but an innocent little
[2:10:49] lamb today
[2:10:53] unless should this be a good time for me
[2:10:55] to enter into the monitor conversation
[2:11:00] come on some of you'll reveal
[2:11:04] it's not about to Facebook it's not
[2:11:06] about the Instagram I'm not supposed to
[2:11:08] put buzz in from Facebook Instagram I'm
[2:11:11] trying to be cool I'm trying desperately
[2:11:16] it's not about those things it's about
[2:11:18] whether they can surrender
[2:11:20] to the word now granted if some of those
[2:11:22] things are
[2:11:23] causing them a problem if an eye offense
[2:11:25] pluck it out
[2:11:27] if the arm's having a problem cut it off
[2:11:29] spiritually speaking of course
[2:11:33] you can't look down your nose at every
[2:11:34] kid you mean they got a Snapchat
[2:11:36] maybe they do
[2:11:39] they're going to go through the same
[2:11:40] type of environment in their own way as
[2:11:42] what we've gone through ours
[2:11:45] let me hurry listen to this in second
[2:11:47] Chronicles chapter 34 or verse 27
[2:11:50] God said because thine heartless tender
[2:11:52] he tells Israel
[2:11:54] that is to Humble thyself before God
[2:11:57] when thou hardest the words against this
[2:12:00] place and the inhabitants thereof
[2:12:03] and against them humbled by self before
[2:12:05] me and you rich your clothes and wept
[2:12:07] before me
[2:12:10] he said I've even heard they saith the
[2:12:11] Lord now if I was to take this and I
[2:12:13] would say okay
[2:12:15] you Gentiles ain't sincere
[2:12:17] you're not humble none of you Gentiles
[2:12:19] me include none of us are sincere
[2:12:22] because when we hear the word of the
[2:12:23] lord we don't rip the beard out of our
[2:12:25] face and tear our clothes apart and
[2:12:27] throw dirt and Ashes on our face and
[2:12:29] weep in the middle of the street for
[2:12:30] days
[2:12:32] you don't do it you're not spiritual
[2:12:37] environment they were raised in this is
[2:12:39] how a Jew showed their humility
[2:12:42] they position themselves in a way to
[2:12:44] where when they were showing God that
[2:12:45] they were sincere about what he said the
[2:12:47] first thing someone did was pluck their
[2:12:49] own beard out of their face oh God
[2:12:51] that's painful even thinking about that
[2:12:54] they take their clothes and just rip a
[2:12:57] big hole in them and they'd start
[2:12:58] rocking on the grounds they put dirt and
[2:13:00] things over their face this was a
[2:13:02] symbolic way that they showed Jehovah
[2:13:04] God we are sincere about what you're
[2:13:07] telling us
[2:13:09] do you know what the equivalent is today
[2:13:12] being able to wake up in the morning and
[2:13:14] raise your hands on the side of your bed
[2:13:15] and say Jesus
[2:13:17] you are my my boss my God my leader
[2:13:24] being able to go through the day and
[2:13:26] fight against the things that are wrong
[2:13:27] struggle against the evils of the day
[2:13:31] some of that humility looks like the way
[2:13:33] you dress ladies boys the way you behave
[2:13:35] to women and things the way you behave
[2:13:36] to one another
[2:13:38] that shows our humility in much the same
[2:13:40] way that they did and if we want to
[2:13:42] point back to that culture and say if
[2:13:43] we're going to be spiritual we got to be
[2:13:44] like that
[2:13:46] well then that same idea shouldn't
[2:13:47] follow down to us
[2:13:49] that we in our generation middle age and
[2:13:52] above should look at the Next Generation
[2:13:53] and say you're going to have a different
[2:13:54] way than what we did and what they did
[2:14:02] the ministry of surrendered all of us
[2:14:04] have that Ministry
[2:14:06] you may never be called to preach
[2:14:11] and if you're a female you'll never be
[2:14:12] called to preach on Facebook Instagram
[2:14:14] or anywhere else for that matter
[2:14:19] but you have a Ministry
[2:14:21] and that is to surrender to the Lord
[2:14:26] let me let me read you something before
[2:14:27] we go can I get a little bit more time
[2:14:28] out of you anybody in a hurry
[2:14:31] I know brother Thomas got a wedding to
[2:14:33] get to after a bit I hope I ain't
[2:14:34] holding you too long for them
[2:14:36] watch us now in Psalm chapter 10 verse
[2:14:39] 17.
[2:14:40] Lord thou Hast heard the desire of the
[2:14:42] humble
[2:14:43] thou will prepare thy their heart
[2:14:48] that will cause thine ear to hear
[2:14:51] so you see when your desire is to be
[2:14:54] submissive
[2:14:55] now listen listen
[2:14:58] it doesn't mean you succeed in
[2:15:01] submission
[2:15:02] it doesn't mean you're perfectly
[2:15:03] surrendered
[2:15:05] but when your desire is to surrender oh
[2:15:09] I fear the Holy Ghost this place
[2:15:11] Hallelujah
[2:15:14] he says Thou will prepare
[2:15:16] thine heart for what
[2:15:19] to receive Grace
[2:15:21] to receive Mercy
[2:15:23] to receive wisdom understanding counsel
[2:15:26] and consolation from the Lord who is our
[2:15:28] comforter
[2:15:30] he actually prepares my heart to receive
[2:15:32] it
[2:15:33] by being what just humble well if it's
[2:15:35] that way with faith and joy and peace
[2:15:37] and healing what about the Rapture what
[2:15:40] about Resurrection if my desire is to be
[2:15:42] surrendered to the Lord we'll also
[2:15:44] prepare my heart to come up when he
[2:15:46] comes for me
[2:15:51] Proverbs 16 19 better it is to be of a
[2:15:54] humble spirit with the lowly
[2:15:56] then divide the spoils with the proud
[2:16:02] Psalm 29 23 a man's Pride shall bring
[2:16:05] him low
[2:16:06] but honor shall uphold The Humbling
[2:16:08] spirit
[2:16:10] Isaiah 57 15 for thus saith the high and
[2:16:13] lofty one
[2:16:15] that hadth eternity whose name is Holy
[2:16:19] I dwell God said in the high and holy
[2:16:21] place with him
[2:16:23] that is of a contrite and humble spirit
[2:16:27] Glory
[2:16:28] to revive
[2:16:30] the spirit of the humble
[2:16:33] and to revive
[2:16:37] the heart of the contrite ones
[2:16:40] how many wants bride's Revival
[2:16:45] I just read you how to get it
[2:16:48] God said he would bring Revival to those
[2:16:50] that are humble
[2:16:52] and those of a contrite spirit he said I
[2:16:55] dwell in the high and lofty places with
[2:16:58] those
[2:16:59] that have the same kind of spirit I do
[2:17:02] [Laughter]
[2:17:05] glory to God no wonder Paul said we send
[2:17:07] Heavenly places with him
[2:17:10] because the way up is always down
[2:17:14] now listen to this let me close
[2:17:16] he questions answers brother Brown it
[2:17:18] says
[2:17:19] is it just three more minutes he says if
[2:17:21] I can to get something short here maybe
[2:17:22] he said I remember I can't give
[2:17:24] completely over to Jesus
[2:17:26] have I an evil spirit he said let me
[2:17:28] spend the rest of the time on that you
[2:17:30] can't surrender to Jesus
[2:17:31] he said I don't know who you are man a
[2:17:33] woman he said I can't tell which it is
[2:17:35] God knows that but you can't surrender
[2:17:37] to Jesus why what's the matter
[2:17:39] he said if you're a woman don't you have
[2:17:41] to surrender to your husband to be a
[2:17:43] wife
[2:17:44] surrender all that you are little lady
[2:17:46] when you were married virtuous follow
[2:17:48] your life to stay virtuous
[2:17:51] one day you found a man that you loved
[2:17:52] you were his completely
[2:17:54] and those things that you fought against
[2:17:56] all of your life try to live clean clear
[2:17:58] virtuous you surrender every bit of it
[2:18:00] to that one man is that right he says
[2:18:02] you put yourself completely in his hands
[2:18:04] you are his
[2:18:05] and all that you stood for decency moral
[2:18:07] and everything like that you turn it
[2:18:09] over to this man because you surrender
[2:18:10] yourself
[2:18:12] can't you do the same thing to Jesus
[2:18:15] Just Surrender yourself that way
[2:18:19] and then in quotations whether I'm says
[2:18:21] It's Like a Prayer like you're saying to
[2:18:23] him all that I am all my mind all my
[2:18:27] thoughts
[2:18:30] he said you with them uh thoughts like
[2:18:32] that he said don't I don't think it's an
[2:18:34] evil spirit that you're possessed of
[2:18:37] but he said an evil spirit certainly
[2:18:39] anoints you
[2:18:42] with them kind of thoughts
[2:18:48] so even brother I was telling this woman
[2:18:49] or man everywhere it's not that you
[2:18:52] can't surrender
[2:18:53] it's just the devil's telling you you
[2:18:55] can't do it
[2:18:57] let me go on record right now every
[2:19:00] single one of us can surrender to the
[2:19:04] Lord
[2:19:05] everybody let me get the balcony so I
[2:19:08] don't miss anybody in the rooms in the
[2:19:09] back
[2:19:12] all of us have the ability
[2:19:16] to surrender like I said starting out
[2:19:17] sister that thing that was placed in Eve
[2:19:20] is carried all the way down 6 000 years
[2:19:23] later that's in women right here today
[2:19:26] the fall didn't take that away from her
[2:19:29] the same thing with the person whoever
[2:19:32] they are
[2:19:33] they have the ability
[2:19:35] to surrender
[2:19:37] to Jesus
[2:19:39] praise God
[2:19:42] so let me show you something why would
[2:19:44] you want to surrender to him
[2:19:45] because there's something calling you to
[2:19:47] surrender
[2:19:50] the very fact she was even or he was
[2:19:52] even asking this question if it was it's
[2:19:54] a very good sign you ought to surrender
[2:19:56] yourself
[2:19:58] the very reason you want to know is
[2:20:00] because God's helping you to want to
[2:20:02] know
[2:20:04] the answers in the question
[2:20:09] if you didn't want that you wouldn't
[2:20:10] care wouldn't bother you you wouldn't be
[2:20:13] interested in it
[2:20:15] but the very fact that you want to know
[2:20:17] how do I get closer to God
[2:20:20] it's because God's in there
[2:20:23] trying to get a hold of your heart
[2:20:26] to let you know
[2:20:28] I want you to surrender
[2:20:36] they say but rather be in aha
[2:20:39] I I've just got so much
[2:20:45] the Bible said a day with the Lord is a
[2:20:46] thousand years a thousand years a day
[2:20:51] do you think your little 40-year 50-year
[2:20:53] 60-year whatever you are a little spot
[2:20:56] in time means all that big of a deal to
[2:20:58] a god that a thousand years is like a
[2:21:00] day
[2:21:01] do you realize when all of this is over
[2:21:03] with I'm talking about church ages and
[2:21:04] everything
[2:21:05] and the new new city sets down on this
[2:21:08] Earth
[2:21:11] seven thousand Church years has passed
[2:21:13] God's gonna do this whole message what a
[2:21:15] week
[2:21:20] to him
[2:21:21] what is your 15 minutes of this or 30
[2:21:25] minutes of that or six month battle or
[2:21:27] one year of this or that thing
[2:21:30] so a God that looks at a day like it's
[2:21:32] A Thousand Years
[2:21:34] it's a tiny little Whistle Stop
[2:21:38] so when we go to him oh I've got so many
[2:21:40] problems I've got so many just look at
[2:21:42] the size of what you're talking about
[2:21:45] verses of God how much you think he's
[2:21:47] seen in a thousand years
[2:21:49] hello and how many billions has he seen
[2:21:52] it with come on you preached to himself
[2:21:55] uh-huh I know I'm a little over time and
[2:21:58] I never killed nobody yet just hang with
[2:22:00] me man
[2:22:03] I'd have quit 20 minutes ago but the
[2:22:05] Lord been dealing with people I'm trying
[2:22:06] to hold on to it as hard as I can
[2:22:10] just say to yourself well you just don't
[2:22:12] understand I I just don't I just don't
[2:22:15] feel that way you don't have to feel
[2:22:17] that way
[2:22:20] I just don't want it you don't have to
[2:22:22] want it
[2:22:24] just be obedient to it
[2:22:27] because what you need to understand is
[2:22:29] your feelings to you
[2:22:33] I've met thousands of people and have
[2:22:35] counseled thousands of people around
[2:22:37] this world that have told me
[2:22:38] emphatically I don't feel it Barry dig
[2:22:41] down to that buried recesses of their
[2:22:43] subconscious long enough and that little
[2:22:44] want to is hiding underneath all of that
[2:22:46] stuff pile on top of it
[2:22:50] sometimes you bury things so deeply you
[2:22:53] convince yourself it ain't that way
[2:22:56] if you just start surrendering the pile
[2:23:01] underneath that pile is a genuine desire
[2:23:04] to want to serve God
[2:23:08] you say it ain't neither then why are
[2:23:10] you here
[2:23:12] well you said in this piece for
[2:23:14] oh my mommy made me come I've met kids
[2:23:16] whose mommy tried to make them come it's
[2:23:19] a bigger mess than what you're talking
[2:23:20] about
[2:23:22] hello
[2:23:25] I've met daddies who forced their kids
[2:23:27] to come oh yeah that that lasts for only
[2:23:30] just a little spot of time
[2:23:33] no you're you're here
[2:23:35] because the Lord Jesus has given you a
[2:23:38] chance to get right
[2:23:39] to surrender fully
[2:23:42] oh I felt that oh yeah that's right
[2:23:44] preaching them young people that's right
[2:23:46] get them right I'm saved already I don't
[2:23:48] need it
[2:23:49] buddy boy
[2:23:51] see that's arrogance
[2:23:54] when you hear something like that about
[2:23:55] a young person that's older ones ought
[2:23:56] to be saying God help me even to do
[2:23:58] triple that
[2:24:00] so I can prove to them what it looks
[2:24:03] like what surrendering really is all
[2:24:04] about
[2:24:06] I don't care how long you've been saved
[2:24:07] how long you've been served the Lord
[2:24:09] whether we be a preachers or not every
[2:24:10] one of us need to continually Die daily
[2:24:13] which means a surrender daily repent
[2:24:15] daily keep ourselves right with God if
[2:24:17] we don't the Rapture is not in our
[2:24:19] future
[2:24:21] last comment we go on home Christ is
[2:24:24] only going to Rapture these kind of
[2:24:27] people I don't care who you are what
[2:24:29] your name is how many times you put in a
[2:24:31] bucket if you ain't that you'll be left
[2:24:33] here when the tribulation begins
[2:24:37] because God will not associate himself
[2:24:39] with a bunch of prideful stuck-up
[2:24:41] message people that think they've got
[2:24:42] the market cornered on Holiness God
[2:24:44] Revelation and everything else
[2:24:47] he's not looking for a monopoly on
[2:24:50] Christ
[2:24:51] he's looking for people that are just so
[2:24:53] grateful
[2:24:54] and just so gracious to him that I could
[2:24:57] be a part of this great program just to
[2:24:59] think he would call me me out of the
[2:25:02] millions and billions in the world out
[2:25:04] of all the generations of all the
[2:25:06] educated and the wealthy and the
[2:25:08] good-looking and the fantasy take all
[2:25:10] the way down through that and he'd go to
[2:25:12] Ohio and get a worthless nut
[2:25:15] foreign
[2:25:18] they call us Buckeyes
[2:25:21] you know what a Buckeye's good for
[2:25:24] nothing
[2:25:26] it is a worthless nut
[2:25:29] God took this worthless nut
[2:25:31] Hallelujah
[2:25:34] glory to his name
[2:25:35] [Music]
[2:25:38] that he made all things beautiful in his
[2:25:40] time
[2:25:42] I don't deserve it
[2:25:44] I didn't work or Merit for it
[2:25:47] he had mercy upon whom he'd have mercy
[2:25:50] compassion upon whom he had compassion
[2:25:53] and brother Brad I'm just grateful to be
[2:25:55] a part of it brother Matt I'm just
[2:25:57] thankful that Jesus thought of me as
[2:25:59] being a part of his plan
[2:26:03] have I made a million mistakes
[2:26:05] oh sure
[2:26:08] have I messed up with zeros on the end
[2:26:10] yeah
[2:26:13] but at the end of the day
[2:26:15] who ain't
[2:26:18] we we puff ourselves they did that but I
[2:26:22] would never do that but what you're
[2:26:24] doing is even worse than what
[2:26:31] I should have ended a few seconds ago I
[2:26:33] had you right where I want you you was
[2:26:34] happy on the mountain then I got to say
[2:26:35] these things like you
[2:26:39] they're not a person living
[2:26:41] that don't experience this kind of move
[2:26:43] in their life
[2:26:46] you're going on going going and all of a
[2:26:48] sudden wamo
[2:26:50] Lord
[2:26:52] it's like the little book are you there
[2:26:54] God it's me Margaret
[2:26:56] she's always going back to him back to
[2:26:58] the well you know are you there God is
[2:26:59] me Margaret
[2:27:01] all of us have experienced mistakes to
[2:27:04] that magnitude
[2:27:07] to where we just think I might as well
[2:27:08] just forget it I might as well quit sure
[2:27:11] we've all been through that but
[2:27:14] you say well how am I supposed to whip
[2:27:16] it I'm so glad you asked me
[2:27:19] keep surrendering
[2:27:22] keep humbling
[2:27:24] keep making yourself littler and littler
[2:27:26] and littler and every time
[2:27:29] you blunder
[2:27:31] go back to him and say Lord Jesus
[2:27:34] it's just one more bit of proof that
[2:27:36] without you
[2:27:38] I'm of all men most miserable
[2:27:43] you back your hands with me just a
[2:27:45] moment
[2:27:54] and even before the musicians come just
[2:27:56] everybody I want I want everybody to
[2:27:58] have a moment
[2:28:02] I didn't keep you here bundle ten to one
[2:28:05] for no reason
[2:28:06] this my friends that's where they say
[2:28:08] the rubber meets the room
[2:28:10] when you come to the end of the planting
[2:28:12] like this and the seeds gone in those
[2:28:13] hearts
[2:28:15] now's where the attention and the
[2:28:17] attraction turns from me giving it
[2:28:19] to you doing something with what's been
[2:28:21] given to you
[2:28:22] now I want you to think within your
[2:28:24] spirit I want all the young girls all
[2:28:26] the young boys all the middle aged all
[2:28:28] the old ones I don't care what your
[2:28:29] station of life is I want you to think
[2:28:31] for a moment
[2:28:33] look back at every issue you've ever had
[2:28:35] every problem you've ever confronted
[2:28:37] maybe things you're going through right
[2:28:39] this very moment
[2:28:40] just just boil it all the way down to
[2:28:43] the very bottom line of it all what does
[2:28:44] it really boil down to
[2:28:46] I just wasn't surrendered like I should
[2:28:48] have been
[2:28:49] every time you got mad and said bad
[2:28:51] words or every time you got mad and
[2:28:53] yelled at somebody or every time you got
[2:28:55] mad and kicked the door in or done some
[2:28:57] kind of crazy thing I'm just being
[2:28:59] ridiculous not this may not fit you but
[2:29:02] just making examples
[2:29:06] every time you got offended or hurt for
[2:29:08] no reason
[2:29:09] to you as a reason but really when you
[2:29:11] looked at it back on the passive line
[2:29:12] man what are you getting mad about that
[2:29:16] every time somebody just slighted you
[2:29:18] and maybe you're sitting here with a
[2:29:19] genuine offense sure
[2:29:22] but maybe your reaction to that
[2:29:25] wasn't like it should have been not as
[2:29:27] Godly not in this right place
[2:29:29] stop and think for a moment children of
[2:29:31] God
[2:29:33] what's the real answer to all of it I
[2:29:34] just wasn't surrendered
[2:29:37] like I should have been
[2:29:42] the very moment any human being ever who
[2:29:44] they are gets to thank him that they can
[2:29:46] control their lives
[2:29:48] that is a person that doesn't understand
[2:29:50] the grace of God
[2:29:54] Grace means
[2:29:57] that you're willing to relinquish your
[2:29:59] control
[2:30:01] so that he can help you while you're
[2:30:03] walking while you're
[2:30:04] moving while you're pressing try and
[2:30:07] fulfill your dreams your Visions your
[2:30:09] aspirations finishing school getting
[2:30:10] through a college going through this
[2:30:12] going through that
[2:30:14] even something someone was driving a car
[2:30:18] there's nothing the Lord doesn't want to
[2:30:20] be active in your life you've heard of
[2:30:23] absentee fathers the Lord is
[2:30:25] not wanting to be an absentee father
[2:30:29] he wants to be there in your life
[2:30:33] sister told me a story the other day
[2:30:36] something that happened to her many
[2:30:37] years ago
[2:30:40] one of her little children her babies
[2:30:42] was nursing and
[2:30:44] she had to go away her husband's a
[2:30:45] minister and had to go on a missions
[2:30:47] trip or go overseas
[2:30:49] while she was
[2:30:50] gone you know she
[2:30:52] she just seemed to
[2:30:55] have all these kind of feelings as
[2:30:56] mothers do about being away from her
[2:30:58] baby
[2:31:02] she got back home and the baby wouldn't
[2:31:04] nurse and wouldn't nurse and wouldn't
[2:31:05] nurse and wouldn't latch and wouldn't
[2:31:06] latch and she just kept fighting and
[2:31:07] struggling wrestling
[2:31:11] and said she finally looked down at the
[2:31:13] baby and said Just Surrender to me
[2:31:17] and said all at once that maybe just
[2:31:19] kind of relaxed itself
[2:31:21] and gave over to the mama and started
[2:31:23] nursing she said the Lord spoke to her
[2:31:24] now this may not be exactly the story
[2:31:26] but
[2:31:27] the short version of it is that the Lord
[2:31:29] spoke to her and said that's the way it
[2:31:30] is with you
[2:31:33] you're going here going there doing this
[2:31:35] doing that but I am El Shady eye the
[2:31:37] breast to God and I would feed you my
[2:31:39] strength my authority if you would just
[2:31:41] surrender to me
[2:31:45] imagine friends every moment you've ever
[2:31:48] had in your life
[2:31:50] maybe you are sitting here right now
[2:31:52] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:31:54] and you know that's the truth
[2:31:55] maybe you're sitting here tonight or
[2:31:58] this morning rather you're sitting here
[2:31:59] back slit you know that you're not where
[2:32:01] you need to be the Lord maybe you men
[2:32:04] you women maybe you married for maybe
[2:32:06] you playing around with things in the
[2:32:07] shadows that you know you ought to be
[2:32:08] fooling with
[2:32:10] you know you're getting ready to get in
[2:32:11] trouble with the Lord you can feel
[2:32:12] things happen and you feel this thing
[2:32:14] happen to that thing I'm what's what's
[2:32:15] really the answer
[2:32:17] surrender
[2:32:19] maybe you're associating with people
[2:32:21] that's going to hurt you down the road
[2:32:23] how do you solve that
[2:32:25] not getting a big fight put them down
[2:32:27] tell them get away from you and scream
[2:32:29] in their face
[2:32:30] surrender to the Lord surrender yourself
[2:32:31] to the right thing
[2:32:34] flee from the things that are wrong
[2:32:37] and cling to that which is right
[2:32:41] now for all of you if your head's bound
[2:32:43] that includes me the pastor the
[2:32:45] ministers the deacons the trustees young
[2:32:48] people older people married people
[2:32:49] single people
[2:32:52] Grandma's grandpas all of us now with
[2:32:54] our heads bowed we're like Israel folks
[2:32:58] at this very moment we've torn our
[2:33:00] clothes
[2:33:01] plucked our beard as it were and put
[2:33:02] ashes on our head and now we're humbling
[2:33:04] ourselves before the Lord that's what
[2:33:05] that bowed head represents
[2:33:09] and I'll take it if God would let me say
[2:33:12] this right if I be Jesus speaking I'll
[2:33:15] take it
[2:33:16] the prophet said that he's such a
[2:33:17] gentleman that if you put him not in the
[2:33:19] first place but the 13th down in the
[2:33:21] basement he said oh he'll take it
[2:33:23] if that's what you're willing to give
[2:33:25] him
[2:33:27] so if your head bowed don't you stop for
[2:33:30] a moment and think you're not doing
[2:33:32] anything to get his attention
[2:33:34] just you bowing your head in this
[2:33:36] service right now
[2:33:38] is assembled before him that you are
[2:33:40] humbling yourself to the voice of God
[2:33:45] now you know your heart you know your
[2:33:47] conditions you know what you're facing
[2:33:50] without specifying without being
[2:33:52] specific not just making calls for
[2:33:54] Sinners and backsliders and
[2:33:56] but for all of us
[2:33:58] you see what your need and your heart is
[2:34:00] and where you're at in your walk with
[2:34:02] God would you just be willing right now
[2:34:03] to say father I'm just going to put one
[2:34:06] hand up here and there maybe two if you
[2:34:08] want to do it that's fine but I'm going
[2:34:10] to put a hand up here in the air Lord
[2:34:11] and I'll say you
[2:34:13] see me
[2:34:15] and now when I raise this hand up to you
[2:34:17] that is a universal sign of I surrender
[2:34:19] to you
[2:34:20] and I'm taking that thing that you see
[2:34:22] in my heart
[2:34:24] and I'm surrendering it friends
[2:34:27] the Lord Jesus is my judge what I'm
[2:34:30] getting ready to tell you
[2:34:32] the moment some of you put your hands in
[2:34:34] the air
[2:34:35] I felt his presence rushed with
[2:34:37] satisfaction
[2:34:41] I'll meet that at his judgment bar if
[2:34:42] I'm lying to you
[2:34:44] I felt a pleasure come out of his
[2:34:46] presence the moment your hands went up I
[2:34:48] felt in his Spirit up here on this
[2:34:49] platform I felt him go ah
[2:34:55] thank you Lord for letting me sense that
[2:34:56] from you
[2:34:57] it's just Vindication Lord of what I was
[2:34:59] telling you people
[2:35:02] it don't have to be a screaming Time
[2:35:03] Around The Altar folks
[2:35:06] all you got to do is just let him know
[2:35:10] I'm here Jesus
[2:35:12] I'm here Lord

[2:35:16] together all of us let's take these
