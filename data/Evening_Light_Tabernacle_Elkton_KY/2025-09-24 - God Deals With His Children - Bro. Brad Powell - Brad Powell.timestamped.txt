[0:00] The scriptures are just full of the
[0:02] stories of restorative power and and his
[0:05] his relentless love. And we see it in
[0:08] the lives of individuals as as God
[0:10] begins to deal with individuals
[0:12] throughout the scriptures. And he he
[0:14] deals with individuals from the
[0:16] beginning all the way to the end. And
[0:18] even now where we live, he's dealing
[0:20] with individuals that are broken, that
[0:23] are hurt, that have been damaged. How
[0:26] many's ever thought, I'm nothing but
[0:27] damaged goods? Sure we have. But God
[0:31] deals with those people and he puts his
[0:33] love. He tenderly puts those people back
[0:36] together.
[0:39] He doesn't leave his people in shambles.
[0:42] God's not going to leave you
[0:44] brokenhearted. He's not going to leave
[0:45] you distressed. He's not going to leave
[0:47] you out wandering around in the
[0:49] wilderness if you're one of his. So when
[0:52] God begins to deal with you, when God
[0:54] begins to pull on your heart and tug at
[0:56] your heartstrings,
[0:58] it's because he's tenderly trying to
[1:00] pull you back into the fold and say,
[1:02] "Come, my child. Come, my child. Get
[1:05] close to me. Get warm by me.
