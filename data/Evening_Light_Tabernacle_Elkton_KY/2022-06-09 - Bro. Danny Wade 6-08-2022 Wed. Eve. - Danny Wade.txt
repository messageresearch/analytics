TRANSCRIPT
========================================
us to getting a closer walk with you lord and i pray that that you'll take control of of every evil spirit that might try and hinder your your voice from being being spoken lord i pray pray that that that sick and afflicted will be healed lord i pray that you he will just come in a powerful way lord and speak to us sorry lord i pray i pray that i'm not just it's just not gonna be me standing here and saying what what i think and why and what um i have to say but but to hear you lord lord we want to hear from you lord lord i pray that that you'll just has come in a powerful way lord i pray in jesus name amen all right if if everyone has your bibles uh turn with me if you will to uh luke eight uh and uh we'll begin with uh verse 43 to 48. uh and a woman having an issue of blood in 12 years which had spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any came behind in him and touched the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stains and and jesus said who touched me when all denied peter and they that were with him said master the multitude thronged thee and pressed thee and says thou who touched me and jesus said somebody had touched me for i perceived that virtue has gone out of me and when the woman saw that she she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for for what caused since she had touched him and and how how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made me whole go on peace may god has blessing to read the word you can receive it amen what what i would what the title of my service is uh making a move for god see because um she it was in in that condition to where she was either going to potentially die from her condition she got to that place where she was in in desperation that she needed something from the lord and and so um what what brother branham said about this is um up up on the hill said a woman knitting i wonder what's all the discouragement all the upset about down there she looked down some of them said you know that healer he's he's come to our town that that's him down there don't don't go down now but but the poor little woman had a blood issue for many years she sold all she had give it to the doctors and none of them could help her they couldn't stop the issue of blood she if that man is the son of god who who claims and to he he claims to be i won't have to have him him to pray for me i'll go down there and just touch the border of his garment and i'll get well that's right i'll just touch his garment and i'll i'll be well in other words if i can make some kind of contact i'll get well and i i see her coming pale face withered up and uh later knitting down and here she comes down the hill there there stood the priest saying where are you going i'm going to meet this man jesus do you realize that will put you out of the church i don't care in a way she went right right on through them here's another man saying do you know that the days of miracles is past don't you know i'm a teacher of the scripture we haven't had miracles since the death of the last prophet well we don't we don't have no miracles them days has passed moses did miracles but this guy is just a fanatic it's just a bunch of psychology that's all it is i can just see here that they said yeah you cannot go i can and see her ducking her little head down and just crawl between their legs and go right on anyhow she she wanted to get to jesus and she said if i can get to him i'll touch him and i'll get well that that's it that's something and in a way she went and jesus everybody around him him like that and she crawled up behind him and she she touched his garment and then and when she touched his garment he stopped looked around over the audience something happened he's the same yesterday today and forever he will do the same same thing here just touch him one time and see looked around said daughter thy faith has made thee whole amen and this is not hid it's in the bible see thy faith has saved me and the woman and felt in her body that the blood issue had stained had stopped see that's what what it takes sometimes god will bring you down down to such a low uh in in every uh generation and every time there's always been when things are going all well it's just like we don't really need god let's just just um let's just do whatever we want do whatever we please same with what what israel did is when they um things were going really really well and then um and then uh they were like all right then you know they started and you know starting to slowly get away from god and then when they when they did and they went to other gods and so forth they got god um he he sent an army to to take over and the king took over and and 18 years later they finally got themselves together and cried out to god and and and when they cried out god came and answered their prayer and send his prophet to go and kill the king and and so so it took that time of desperation that time of whether they needed something for from god for them to finally reach out it took him 18 years to realize they needed that but but but then they realized what is what had happened to them and they were they were god's servants at one time then they drifted away and then and then god had to send hard times to bring them back to him god never left them he just he just simply a um let them be overthrown by an enemy let them them see where they're at let them get down to the lowest valley and then and then realize oh i i know what what we've done they all of a sudden realize where they're at and what condition they're into to where they they get to that state of repentance and they turn from their ways and cry out to god for his help once again and um and so oh yeah it takes sometimes it takes desperation it takes being in a a bad place to to where you actually get in in desperation for god i think that if things are always going well and and we begin to to go through a this nation and it went through really hard times it went through absolute um i mean went through wars and and then we got this great nation we fought for this nation and everything but then then we started taking it for granted we say look at all the this goods that everything's good and then and then we we begin to get soft and and we get a generation that that is is so so weak and and it becomes getting weaker i i read this quote a while back it says um let me just find it here real quick tough times create strong men strong men create easy times easy times create weak men weak men create tough times and that that is is true it's not always true in every sense because some people get weak in tough times and and give up but but in general that that's kind of how it is and and that's what where this nation is getting to to a place where uh uh it goes way down and crashes on and then once everything gets to to the worst point where it's in the in the valley of um desolation or whatever then they start crying out uh god save us god and and it has happened in in many a uh different civilizations i would say in sodom and gomorrah as the flames fell they were all crying out and repenting and everything else but it's too late and and that's what what and what's going to happen they can't hide themselves under underneath the rocks that the bible says they'll try to hide themselves in their rocks from from god the one that they took out of school is the one that they took out of everything and foresay it forsook god because of a time of of pleasure and good things that that we got right now sure we got it's starting to go downhill right now that's because because he got president doesn't it nobody know what he's doing but but but yeah that that's that's kind of what happens in in every single generation and and i didn't think i was going to start out this way but but here we are anyways there's there's another uh i have quite a few verses here um let's see oh yeah this was actually the main one i was going to go off of it it's a quite long one it's luke 7 if you want to go to it in verse 37 and 50. and and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner and when she she knew that jesus and me in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box appointment and she stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the pharaoh in him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touched and toucheth him for she is the sinner and jesus answered it and said and unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he said master say on and there there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 pence and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him the most simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave the most and he said and until now has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto simon see style this woman i entered unto the thy thine house that gave us me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head she she gave us me no no thou gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time i came and had not ceased to kiss my feet my head went with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman have anointed my feet with ointment wherefore say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat and meet with him begin to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman thy faith has safety go in peace see this one this woman she she she was in such a bad state she she was brother brandon said that she was a prostitute and and she she was the worst center in the in the building and she but but she has something in her heart she's seen jesus with his his feet unwashed and with a filth filthy feet you can imagine how filthy it was as that's what what brother brandon said it and with his feet all right really dirty and everything and she she used it was her hair which which was her her only glory that she had because she hadn't had really long hair but but but even even though no one else else knew who this man is she recognized who who he who he is and and and so uh oh sh she she did and she was standing there all scared and and she she didn't know what he was going to do tell him and tell her that um shout out her to leave or whatever and and yet yet she she still made that move even though she was scared she had a lot of fear and i could imagine and how scary that would be this man that you know is a prophet and you just uh or she recognized to be a prophet and and she it goes in and and does that at forum and not even knowing and um how his reaction was going to be now uh what uh i was gonna i'm gonna read here what um yeah here it is what brother brandon said about this and and she rushed in real quick went went and got that alabaster box for oil probably had bought it with the money from her prostitution but what was it she she might have thought he is a he is a prophet but i remember another woman in my effects another character like mine she had the opportunity and she recognized him and she was forgiven up there there at the uh well of uh sideshow uh if i'm pronouncing it right last night we talked of it in it and if i can only get to him i know who he is i'll do him a service if the the rest of them i don't i don't care what what they do i'll do him a service i'll recognize he's the son of god and and that's exactly what what she did she she run in she got real close to him she felt so guilty that's the way a real dependent penitent and sinner feels in his presence guilty and and the tears begin to fall and and she was trying to hide them they they dropped on his feet she was going to annoy him but the tears dropped me on his feet and she she began to wipe them in and crying and and wiping them with their hands and and his feet was all getting uh forgive me if i pronounce this wrong mused up with the the dirt that that was on it and and if if you want to really believe it with the stink of the animals off the trail everyone walked the same trail and there there was a stink on him sitting there and her tears were dropping on his feet and she was trying to wipe them off and and she had no towel what what is the woman's beauty and honor is your hair that's the reason many of you women today cut it all off that's wrong she she took her hair and began to wash the his feet and wipe them her her pretty hair taking the stink off of him and upon herself bearing his reproach oh my that that's when you recognize who is in your presidency our sisters would have to almost stand on their head to get enough hair to do that so so there she she washed his feet and wiped them with the hairs of her head and she kissed his feet and that old simon standing back there said uh oh i can and just see him blow up he didn't recognize who he was said i told and told you he wasn't a prophet if he he was a prophet he would recognize that what kind of woman that is around him jesus never moved a foot he he just watched her and she was scared then after he had got through she doing the service to him she she looked over said simon i've got something to say to you you invited me here you brought me here in other words a trump update a trump upper sleeve you you wanted to show me off you wanted to prove that i wasn't what i am and you when you brought me here you should have had and my feet washed but you never you you shouldn't give me oil to anoint my head but you didn't you never kissed me welcome and this woman ever since i've been here has washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with their hair and constantly has kissed my feet since i've been here i i have something against you simon that then he turn turns to her i just i can just imagine seeing her standing there and her big pretty eyes all stained up and her face is and where she had grease and off of the road on her face and and she she thinks and and what have i done and have i done wrong he said it and i say unto her her sins which are many are all forgiven go in peace what was it she recognized she recognized her opportunities see she did it she did him a service the pharisees didn't do it she saw it and recognized his presence and what what did it do it washed what what it didn't release to her forgiveness released to her forgiveness of her sins what did it do also it also released the power of god to show them unbelievers that he was a prophet he knowed who she was it also released joy and power and eternal life it released that amen and and and see see what she did as as any example of um not not caring about the fears that try to pull you back from doing what you know is why she had it on her heart i've got to do this i've got to go and buy that at alabaster box and only hit his feet and they all ignored her they all all just was like no no that's what he's just uh we're just gonna um we're not going to greet him or anything we don't don't really care about him he is like it's like inviting this homeless guy off the street to tonight out front from the street with his dirty feet and everything why would we even want to deal with that and but that was because they didn't know who he was and and yet that she even though she was so scared and she felt it felt in her heart i i don't know i i um my flash is telling me say no don't do that that that's that's a prophet right there you don't want to touch him you don't want to get close to him you're not worthy to be in his presence even but but yet yet she felt in herself to that that i have to it's it's uh seeing his feet dirty i can't understand it he's he's more than this he he he deserves this he she recognized who he was and and when and in doing that she she felt she had to do in that service she had to to go go through that in and i know uh it feels sometimes that that god is calling you due to a certain purpose to each and every one of us have our own calling in our own specific place and and it takes getting out of your comfort zone and getting getting past that and saying i don't care what anybody else is going to think she knew she knew the pharisees they says or whoever across from jesus was going to judge her she knew everyone in the building was going to say and think things against her look at this this prostitute going up to this this man and washing his his feet with her hair look look at her and he should know what kind of vile thing this is right here and and all throughout the bible it always considers a prostitute as being the worst sinner in in the bible pretty much and that there she was annoying anointing his his feet with oil you know like coming out of her comfort zone which obviously she wasn't comfortable no doing that knowing who he he was and and i couldn't could imagine and just about anyone being that close to him and knowing who he was that would be nervous and be scared of what what he's he may be thinking and what what he might he might think of me in the end is he gonna accept this and and we we don't know see with with me i remember when i was at linton a little kid in the pew wanting to say men but i couldn't say amen because i was too shy and i remember i was like you know and and the first time raising my uh hand is i i here i got written down here i remember one of the first times raising my hand in church during a prayer and picking to make sure no no one was watching and and i and i wasn't the only one and raising my hand i remember just it was just like like that was is it was my fa what family sitting next to me or standing next to me and i would just be it just be like oh no oh if my my other family are raising their hand maybe i shouldn't it is it was just like that and and and uh and and so it would also be when the the first time i started saying amen i said it so quietly even i couldn't hear myself saying amen amen and and and it it just uh every time i mean it it's just like like that i remember um when when i was younger i decided that i was going to pray to them and dismiss my sunday school class for extra points of course i wouldn't do without getting any extra points but instead i froze and and uh there and in silence there was complete silence everything was quite and and uh everything was completely silent for for like three minutes or so and uh because i couldn't think of anything i was so nervous i was like come on you gotta say something all of a sudden my mind completely froze i i couldn't i couldn't get a single word out my my mouth and and and that now not now look at me i'm preaching i mean that that's proof that god can change someone sin so much it just takes that desire on the inside that you realize this is more important than anything and you surrender everything to him and realize that it doesn't matter what anyone thinks only what god thinks and that is how i've come this far i i don't say oh i've worked myself up this far i say it was it was not nothing but god that's helped me through it through this whole thing and just to even and get the strength to go up here and preach i mean it takes a lot don't don't get me wrong i still have fears and and nervousness but i i know know that oh i'm doing this for god because what he thinks is all that really matters amen and and every time i i asked them for them to sing this song because every time i hear that song with the lyrics that special night when i saw your glorious light i i remember that night at youth service here years ago there was a youth service in and it was just like every single youth service that i went to i was like there's always that pool you you you need to to go to that alter there's there's just something and it was like the first second youth in camp it was here i think he was in the pew back there when i was just thinking and what what was everyone gonna think was was i was there with my siblings uh annabelle and michael john and i was just like i don't know if i should do this i don't think and it was like that almost every time i always had that call something something in in my heart said go but but then i always tell my bat and self something always held myself back i believe it was satan it wasn't myself because because i wanted to go but but it was always something that said no what are your family going to think what what is what what are they going to think what is is and my brothers and sisters going to think what and then it was just in just that one one time when it was so overwhelming i said enough don't don't think and i i was just like hey i i i just let let go i just completely said i'm going to do this because i feel something on the inside that's calling me to that altar i felt felt that i i had to go and and it was just drawing me and it got so much like that and and what are they going to think what it what's your family god think you look stupid and i said it i'm gonna go i don't care what anyone else thinks i don't i was like don't think because i i seen something that said and if you whenever you there's a five-second rule where where you just tell yourself you gotta do it in five seconds you gotta let go of of the the thoughts that try to hold you back and you and when you know that you you got to do it you just don't think at all instead instead of if you're thinking loads of dots and everything you just say enough don't think and so so i walked out i walked down that and it was these pews down here i walked down and i got and and i remember i was kneeling i i remember it was like i was i was in this view like i think right here and and and i was just right here and and i would i was just thinking my siblings are right there and i was thinking just don't think it's just like something to control my feet and i just walked up like this and and then i remember i was like right in here and then i just it got on my knees and i raised my hands and then and then it was it was so amazing and i i was just praying and i was crying and crying out to god i didn't care what anyone else thinks i i'm i'm giving my my everything to you lord and i just and i i believe that was one the night i got saved and it was just like like i seen i was with my eyes shut and i've seen i've seen in uh this i seen a dive like in a pillar of fire air shaved like like a fire and it was just in my mind it was just i couldn't explain it it's just so amazing i could feel the presence of god i don't believe that that was when i got the baptism into the holy ghost but that was that was when i felt that in the holy ghost for the first time and it was the most amazing experience and i can always go back to that time because it was such a powerful night and that's what why i say when i sing that song on that special night when i saw your glorious light that was that special night when i saw his glorious thought it was it was the most amazing thing i've ever experienced from that time and then i've experienced similar experiences but but with everyone everything that almost the same as that like when when i got baptized and stuff what i said but it was so so amazing that special night and and when i i just let go and i didn't care what anybody else thinks and that that's how it is that that that's how it's got to be we always get in in a place where we're like looking at the the people next to us what are they going to think and they say i feel like dancing but you don't because you're like oh i'm going to look like an idiot here i'm going to look stupid and and that's and that's when i learned i i got to get out of my comfort zone and and i don't i don't care you have to get to that place where you don't care what anybody else thinks that's how it is to begin with with the the gospel to begin with you don't care what anybody else thinks yeah and and just like noah everyone's laughing and look at this city and here building an ark when there's never been any rain ever and and yet yeah and you got to be someone's full you're either full for christ or you're full for the devil and that that's how that's how it is and and you you can either go too far or you can just stay in a comfortable place in the church pew and just sit in the back and just be like this all the time and and never have really never really have much of an experience and just be a like a baptist oh my that that's that that's what we we need to do just just let go of these and these these thoughts of doubt what and and thinking what is everyone else gonna think i don't i don't know if i should do this and and we always go back to that and and that's what happens when when when you let the the devil get control uh oh when you you just stay stay and stay back and he's he's got you where he wants you if you if you just listen to every single time he tells you yes sit still sit still stay where you at don't do don't do anything just don't don't move so something that doesn't move at all is dead [Music] just like brother branham said with emotion something that is emotionless is dead and and so that that's how it is also with moving making a move for god instead of just sitting still or just sitting back and never really doing anything and never really seeking god that's why i said sometimes it takes the hard times to get you to the place where where you need to be to aid and and that's kind of how it is with trials and things if god let us all have a really comfortable life then we probably would still be out in the world a lot most of us or and and that's how how it is we have to go through troubles and trials and things other and or otherwise we won't appreciate the good and that is also why their sickness and everything else because as you can't enjoy being well without there being sickness and and uh you can't enjoy the sunshine as much without there being rainy days amen and and that's and i i've when i understood that that when we get we get sick sometimes and we get back things happen so and and that's the thing if if everything was always good we would always we we would never be content we would never be content because as you get into a place where you want more and more and more and then and then it's just always good good times and you just like you you begin to get lazy and that's how always how it is in in every generation and everything if if things go good all the time then people start getting lazy i also heard this quote i i kind of put these to the side because i wasn't sure if i was going to say them i heard this quote while back lazy people do a little work and think they should be winning but winners work as hard as possible and still worry if they're being lazy and i mean that that really has a lot to do with um that that is how it is really because um i mean uh if you really going after something you're not just going to sit back and relax and say i'll be when you really desire something when you really want something you work hard for you're not you're not like like what just sit back and relax and not do anything about it and then that's why it takes it takes for us to make a move in order to make god and in order for god to move for us like and every um all throughout the bible it always shows a time where um uh god will bring prophets and stuff and tell the the nations repent and repent or perish basically and and and if they ain't they decided to just sit still and not do anything then that then they'll they'll receive the wrath of god otherwise is they have to make that move for god in order for god to to move for them then that is why if if anyone is sick or an error in need of something if you don't if you just um stay still and not even and see god that then god's not going to move for you either amen and and that's why god demands us to reach out in faith reach out to god in faith if you're seeking for something and and when god asks you to do something to do it and and to do it with thanksgiving and do it with diligence in and with your whole heart i've seen a sign on the way here that that set says his work work er eric hard with with your hands and your heart so so we're not to just work hard work with our hands and say oh i'm i'm doing all this work all these good things but if your heart's not in it then what really work are you doing you're just doing it for yourself if if you're not doing with all your heart and your ear you say lord god i'm doing this for you this is what you have called me to do and and you give it everything that you have and then and then that's that's the kind of work that god wants us to do a kind of work that we're doing it for him and not for ourselves and and we're giving in our whole heart not not just doing it because we have to but we're doing it because we want to and that's how it always should be in everything in youtube and it says in the bible in in everything you do do it for the glory of god amen and um i also got a few other places in the bible uh let's see but be doers of the word and not hears only deceiving in your own selves this is james 1 and verse 22 for for if any be a hearer of the word not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and go with his wings straight away forget it what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continue it there he being not a forgetful here but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed see there's so many people in this world that are hearers of the word but not doers then they say oh i'm i've actually met people that say i i follow the bible i've i um well i i read the entire bible i actually talked to someone like that but yet they're living out in the world and doing whatever they want and not doers otherwise they're hearers but not doers of the word and and you say oh amen to thy amen to that but but if you never actually follow it then then what are you doing see god calls us to be doers of his word and not only hearers and and so that's and that's how it is and if in order to get god to move on the scene in it it takes two people in the in the it takes two for a relationship to come to to be so it takes two for for god to make a move in your life it takes two takes you um presenting yourself in the right way and seeking after god uh for god to come on the scene and move in your life you have to move for him to say god god come and help me in and and you follow his word exactly like that then he'll come and and and help you and what whatever you need and he'll be there amen all right i got another place here in uh matthew 20 uh verse 30 to 34. and behold two blind men sitting by the wayside when they heard that jesus passed by cried out saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david and the multitude rebuked them because they they should not hold their peace see that the multitude said and you you you guys are being saying stupid what are you doing he he's and he's got work to do you're you're you're not worth him stopping you're look at him he he's he's the prophet or he said the different ones saying different things he's the prophet he's he's he's so busy he don't got time for you he doesn't care about a sinner like you stay still but they cried the more saying have mercy on us oh son of david and jesus stood still and called them and said what will ye they that i shall do unto you and they said unto him lord that our eyes may be open so jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him see see they didn't care what anybody else else was saying around them they're probably telling them all kinds of stuff if y'all ain't worthy yeah you don't know i don't even know this guy why and why why cr are you crying for it then shut up but but yet something on the inside told them they they can receive their healing they can become they can see if if they he just has to say the word you know their received their sight and they had faith and they pushed and they said i don't care what these other people are saying i don't care what anybody else says i'm i i'm not going to to let these voices stop me from doing it from getting my healing i'm not going to let anything stop me because i know this could be my only chance to to receive my sight and so so they and that's what they did they and they cried out have mercy on us oh lord and they they didn't stay still and they didn't stand sit back and watch or well they couldn't have watched them anyway but it hurt and walked by but but that's how it was they they they couldn't just let him pass them by they had to to receive their healing they had to get that that healing and and they knew that they could receive it amen and that that's how how i know i've i felt a lot and that the feeling of um pressure they didn't get given to to peer pressure or or anything that that around them that would try to hinder them from receiving that that healing they wasn't listening to any voice that told them and not to go and i better hurry here we know much time anyways um here in luke 14 16-33 it says that and then then said he unto a certain man made a great supper and paid money and sent his servants at supper time and say to them that were bitten come for all things are not ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse first one said unto him i have bought a piece of ground and i don't see it i pray thee have an excuse another said i've bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i pray that you haven't excused another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come so that servant came and showed his lord these things and then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in heather the poor and the maimed in the hall and the blind and the servant said lord islam is a commanded and yet there is room and the lord said unto the servant go into highways and hedges and compel them and to come in that my house may be filled and and um that then i'm not going for i'm probably not going to read this whole thing but but that's the the thing we we always it's either um we we think to ourselves i don't i'm not sure if i should do this and and stuff and things trying to hold you back and then you begin to make excuses and excuse time and time and again in in in the bible this is quite a few people i think that have made excuses like like moses i cannot speak um very clearly and and i don't i don't know if i am able to do this and and will they actually hear me and whatever and and beginning making excuses that that's how it is sometimes excuses after excuses making excuses and and and if we keep making excuses time and time again eventually time is going to run out and we can we can't keep making excuses and this many people today make excuses i have my job i have i can't make it on wednesday because of my job i made that excuse one time but but then i i started realizing wait now it's either i'm just making an excuse or i'm i'm simply uh i simply can't or i'm making excuse and then i realize well maybe i can try to figure this out and and then and then i actually started going on wednesday nights even with my full-time job i had and and and yet and then and then that's where i realized that i was actually just making an excuse and even though though it was late and i got off work late a lot of times i was still simply making an excuse when i when i could actually make it to church and and and that's what we we do a lot of times we make make excuses and when uh something may be going on but and you say i don't got the time i don't got at the time i got this job and everything and i've made those excuses many times i know by experience that that it's actually just an excuse that you're not making the time to do instead you're just saying you've got busy schedule and everything that blah blah blah and then and then you go in and and you need we need to go and look at our schedule and get done a pen all right time to make time with god make time with god read the bible start writing down in our schedule let me let me make time for god and stop making excuses and stop saying i can't do this i can't stand uh i can't seek him i can't i don't have time to pray for an hour in the closet i don't got time to do this well no for for me it was simply i i don't got time in it and then i realized well and then then oh yeah okay you're spending how much time on your phone four hours a day okay and and then you cut down on the time that you spend on things that are trivial and that don't matter and spend that time for god and and now my uh time on my phone i think his has either has been like cut in half for like at one hour or something and and and really that that's that's the thing we need to stop making excuses see see god and i i felt it when when god brought me to this place where i'm at such a low to i to where i actually start seeking god and i actually start really getting on my knees and praying for for like two hours it was in the closet and and how did i have that time to do it uh well i quit my job well i had that time because i made that time and i didn't miss well that that didn't help at all that job did but it's it's always that we we make excuses and say we ain't got time and because of this or because of that but we need to get a pen and write in our schedule that's that's what we need to do amen i know i know i i need to do that more than that but write him down in your schedule a little more a little more a little less time with this and a little more time with him reading in the bible and stuff [Applause] amen um let's see here like like um like like daniel and and like um uh the uh shatter act me shack and abednego but when when a time really came down to it they they didn't and just um give in to peer pressure like everybody else everybody else bowen what is everybody gonna think if we just stand here and and but they stood there anyway because they knew what they were standing for and and they knew even if they would get burnt up even if they would get burned burnt up to a crisp and and they would die they're still going to stand for for god and and really a they'd just not give in to anything that they try to and try to to um tell him and well why aren't you bowing and we're not careful to to tell this to you but we won't serve your god we won't bow to him and and that they made that that stand for god they made they even when the pressure was as at the uh to the place where they would die if they didn't stand they still stood for him and they still watch and this is a um quotes by brother brandon watch here comes the the word the preacher faith cometh by hearing hearing the word listen to elijah go seek god first bake that little cake and bring it out to me for thus saith the lord the meal will never cease neither will the the cruise right run or uh cross harvest but i think how to pronounce that but run dry until the the day that god sends rain on the earth amen you see it then with the last sustaining of life she had she laid it on the fire of the cross and sought god first brought the uh whole cake out and gave it to elijah and he ate it i i'd like to have one like that wouldn't and you and he ate it and she she went back and dipped out a big hole cake out of the barrel enough to make one for her son and eat until the rain come why god sent his preacher faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word the invitations give out now as soon as invitation was given out then the excuses was made oh yes what one married a wife and the other one brought some oxen you know the story that that's the way it is today god made the supper and ready sent the preacher to preach the faith what happened oh i can't go because i'm a deacon in another church i just couldn't do that well i couldn't go because it was it would lower my prestige your prestige then then oh i couldn't because i didn't don't believe them old holy rollers that's acting like that i'll just i'm going to live my life the excuses was made oh it's too straight i wouldn't want to do that excuse and and say well i'm so tired when i i come in at night i can't go to church that's excuses today oh i'm afraid that and husband wouldn't like it and i'm afraid my wife would kick me out of the house she ought not to that that's the kind of men you are that's right button but there you are excuses made many of them we could name excuses amen we we all make excuses sometimes why we can't do this or that for god and say oh i'm not good enough and and me maybe i'm i'm still questioning whether god actually wants me to do that or not when it's in his word and for us to do those things and and different things like that we we have a tendency to make excuses on just about everything and and we say well i can't can't go to altar to be prayed for because i'm too scared that's why it takes and accept that pull that that desire that and you just say enough and you go forward anyhow even in with all the fear i was so scared this is the first time of me walking out in faith and saying i'm gonna go to the altar because i feel that call in my heart that i got to and and i i felt that i had to and and that's how how it is is despite the fear despite the thoughts that that come in my head the things that satan tries to tell me to not he was trying with everything he could it was like it always felt like chains were trying to hold me back from going to the altar and i was the alter oh my and i had that experience and and that experience came from from i'm just just giving into what what god wants me to do knowing this is what what god wants me to do and you put that at the foot in front of you and you just do it don't think about the things that that satan tries to put in your mind you gotta take that step if i would have just stood still if i would have just stood there and in and resisted every single time i would be resisting the holy ghost and that that's how it is sometimes we resist the holy ghost by making excuses after excuses and sick and put in these lights and here and you listen to me yeah i guess i'm too scared yeah i guess i have all this fear and anxiety of me doing that i i'm so so nervous as to do that i'm so nervous to start saying amen in church i'm too nervous to raise my hand i'm too nervous to do this excuse after excuse after excuse i can't do it i can't do it i can't do it but jesus christ says you can and and he has given you the power to do it he has given you you the power you just have to reach out in faith and say god i surrender myself to you god i i know i'm scared i know i have this fear i know i have this anxiety but yeah i'm going to do it anyway because it's what you want me to do and and you reach out in faith and you say god you can't take control and and oh my and i took my feet forward and i just said i got to do this i got to do this no turning back no turning back i'm i have to this is my calling god is calling me to the altar and and not give in to the excuses don't just stop making excuses it's not too late for where the time time is running out when when those and people that make those excuses and excuses and excuses will one day say i wish i didn't give in i wish i wish i didn't give in to those excuses the lies that satan said i wish i didn't and it's just be i wish i didn't i wish i did this i wish i went forward i wish but i was too scared and that that time comes and you're just like i could imagine if i didn't walk forward if i if i didn't and go forward if i didn't surrender myself to god if i didn't want to take those first steps out of my comfort zone out of that fear that that fear that was trying to hold me back i could imagine on the day and day of judgment i put it in your heart to do that i put it in your heart to go forward i called you but you didn't hear it uh and i was too scared god i was i had too much fear i i it held me back i was too scared to get out of my comfort zone to raise my hand for you but during the prayer thing i was i was too scared to get on my knees to pray i was excuses after excuses god doesn't demand us and give excuses and and when that time comes i don't want that guilt and and feeling uh i could have done better i could have done this better but i was too scared and i i i was scared of what other people would think it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks the only thought that counts is god's thoughts and and when we let go of the the fear and the anxiety and the things that hold us back and and sure some of us have it worse than others so bad i imagine i was just i'm so scared and like i said i couldn't even speak when it came to to praying in in sunday school and there's the fear and the anxiety and the the feeling i don't think i could do this how am i i remember thinking why would god choose me to be a preacher i didn't and in fact i wasn't even sure if my mom was right about that calling that's why god had to reveal to me himself that that this is my calling and god had to reveal it specifically to me because i didn't really believe wave necessarily what mom said oh i'm gonna be a preacher well i'm too scared how am i i'm have stage fright i had so bad stage fight and and people say well you have to go sing well that was me going out of my comfort zone to do that and i went up there my knees shaking like this and you couldn't see on the film i was just shaking so bad when i first went there to sing it i was like and here i am still still being i still have such an um i still have nervousness when i first get up here because it's going out of my comfort zone but i know it is what god called me to do and i know know that this is is the place i'm supposed to be and so i don't care what anybody else thinks i'm i get here and i get scared what is other people kind of thinking and what's that good sermon and i'm always like if i play my papers and try trying to have fun and try to not have it too much of a silence um time try to find something and then and mumble over myself and my words and but i'm i'm still here and i'm i'm doing what god called me to do and getting out of my comfort zone and uh and sometimes i need to remember that this is what god wants me to do it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks if god called me to do this it's okay to to be scared or just keep going just you'll be scared just do it scared just do it with all that fear nervousness just do it get out of your comfort zone and it'll get less and less and and the fear and anxiety will start to leave and and you'll get mad more and more er in and you'll get less and less scared and fearful and nervous and and that's how it is it's always a slow journey and getting used to things getting but start that that's that was my point and start start getting out your comfort zone start whispering amen underneath your breath start right um raising your hands so no one can see it but but still raising your hand but just start that's how it is i i started and i i because i had that desire in my heart i wanted to i wanted to do this i i wanted to to see god i wanted to grow closer to god i wanted to get out of my comfort zone and then as the musicians come and uh even my uh sister she said my sister i seen such a change in her because she she said she listened to a sermon at the church camp and about getting out of the comfort zone your comfort zone and and and i was amazed by it and bill actually even even would dance for the lord and it's it's it was such a change that i've seen in her okay because all because she she knew that she had to start getting out of that comfort zone and start pursuing in god and start and forgetting what anybody else thinks just do what god wants you to do he his thoughts is the only thing that really counts in and and i've seen it well i didn't see her but but she told me she went and went to the uh there's a prayer line and she went in that prayer line to get prayed for and and and if she wouldn't have got i knew annabelle um i've never seen anybody go to to alter anything before so i knew i knew what it was like that first time going to all altars or or getting in the prairie line is so it's so like you're going to the altar and everybody's looking at you wonder what he's done wonder what she's done to don't think that it's not it's never a thing of what have they done look at that that's how we we can't ever get as a church we can't ever look down on the people that go go to the altar whatever it might be and and and so she went in the prayer line to go and get and prayed for and and that was that night she received the gift of holy ghost and she told me how amazing it was and and i remember us in the car and stuff on the way back and and she was shouting thank you jesus thank you jesus the the top of her lungs at one time and she said that was the same feeling she got when she got the baptism in the holy ghost again i was like oh my thank you god i was like wow this is this is amazing that she had that experience it's so amazing that how good god and god is to us amen and and i i just urge you if if there's something that if there is something that that is on your heart to do but that fear is holding back maybe it might be going to altar maybe it might be just just just getting closer to god doing something that god wants you to do if you could play some music softly it could be anything like that i mean just getting out of your comfort zone just saying it's starting to say amen in church just anything like that anything that god god is just putting on your heart coming forward [Music] or just pulling you to that altar and saying come forth by my child i'm calling you and and that's on on your heart to do so and that fear that tries to to pull you back tries to to get a hold of you and saying sit still and you say no i'm gonna do what god wants me to do and he wants me to do this i'm gonna say not today satan i'm gonna go forward in victory i'm gonna find god i'm gonna i'm gonna do what he wants me to do i'm going to get out of my comfort zone i'm going to stop giving in to the lies the excuses that i keep making i i just wanna [Music] do what he wants me to do and if any of you feel like that [Music] everyone um stand if you will but [Music] if it and everyone close your eyes and if you feel that call just raise your hands or [Music] or come forward to be prayed for to the altar if if god is calling you [Music] if if you feel that pull saying [Applause] come forth and and you just keep fighting those excuses if you want to come forward to be prayed for for anything for healing for deliverance for anything but that fear i know it's that fear that that tries to pull you back and say no don't do that don't don't go to be prayed for don't don't do that but you say no no not anymore i'm not going to give in anymore do you lie satan i'm not going to i'm not going to keep holding back from doing what god has called me to do anything that god is calling you to do if you just say god i surrender my i will and to you i surrender everything to you lord and i'll do what you have called me to do and i'll get out of my comfort zone and i'll i'll start i'll start seeking you i'll start going after you lord i pray lord i pray that that you'll you'll help us to to not be ashamed of you to where where where we hold back from from going to the places you want us to go to not do and do what you have called us to do lord forgive us for our excuses that we make all the time lord for not not serving you for not doing what you wanted us to do lord forgive us and let us let us renew that relationship we had with you to where or or just create that that desire to get outside of that in our comfort zone lord let us get out then our comfort zone if there's there's a call there's something and deep down on the inside that reaches out for you that you're calling us to that that calling or that that place that that you want us to to be lord to seek you lord we desire to go close to you lord and if that takes doing things that we're scared to do let's do that lord help us to do that help us to get out of our comfort zone help us and not care about what anybody else thinks because lord i know we do that way too often lord forgive us for that lord help us to not to not make those same excuses that we make all the time and lord help us to to just do what you want us to do lord guide us and help us give us that strength that we need lord to to seek you and lord i pray that you and help each and every one of us to go on a closer walk with you lord and and it most of the time it does take getting into a place where we're sometimes scared and you draw us out onto the waters like you did peter and we're scared to do that sometimes lord but let us not have that fear that holds us back let's break free from that fear lord break free from every chain every anything that tries to hold us back the excuses we make let us break free from that lord help us oh god help us pray in jesus name amen amen let's sing that song um thank you thank
