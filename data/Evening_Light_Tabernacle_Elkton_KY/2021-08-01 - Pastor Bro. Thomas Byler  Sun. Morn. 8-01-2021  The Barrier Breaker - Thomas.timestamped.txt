[7:14] history
[7:19] maybe brother joe will open us in prayer
[8:00] uh the children can be dismissed for
[8:02] sunday school we'll turn
[8:03] the scripture to psalms 119.
[8:22] we're going to read one through
[8:25] 16.
[8:29] blessed are the undefiled in the way who
[8:31] walk in the law of the lord
[8:40] they also do no iniquity they walk in
[8:42] his ways
[8:49] oh that my ways were directed to keep
[8:51] thy statutes
[8:58] i will praise thee with uprightness of
[9:00] heart when i shall have learned thy
[9:02] righteous
[9:06] judgment
[9:09] wherewithal shall young men cleanse his
[9:11] way by taking heed there unto according
[9:14] to thy word
[9:22] word have a hidden mine heart that i
[9:24] might not sin against thee
[9:30] with my lips have i declared all the
[9:32] judgments out of thy mouth
[9:40] i will meditate meditate in thy precepts
[9:43] and have respect unto thy ways
[9:45] i will delight myself and thy statutes i
[9:48] will not forget
[9:49] that word god bless you may be seated
[9:51] brother brian
[10:06] yes brother troy's being nice to us we
[10:08] didn't read that whole song
[10:11] you know uh in some hebrew to traditions
[10:15] as a young man you've got to be able to
[10:17] recite the whole the whole song
[10:19] but you can't be born mistered until you
[10:22] can recite that whole song
[10:23] so i guess we get off easy
[10:28] i i was gonna before i get started
[10:32] since this is the first sunday in
[10:35] august i'll let brother thomas talk
[10:39] about it but
[10:40] i've expanded everything that was been
[10:43] given
[10:44] for missionary offering and i and i sent
[10:46] it up to uh by believers church he can
[10:49] explain to you how he
[10:50] how he set up the offering so that was a
[10:54] like i told you a couple weeks ago we
[10:57] gave a 700
[10:58] check to one of the brothers going
[11:00] overseas and then i sent a 7 300
[11:02] check to bible believers for the
[11:04] missions that he dedicated
[11:07] as of this morning after the
[11:10] payment goes in the principal amount
[11:12] left on the church
[11:14] will be 86 000 and about 877 dollars
[11:18] and i just want to let you know this
[11:21] month in august and going into september
[11:24] so that means the payment for one
[11:26] september or the 10th of september in
[11:28] october
[11:30] i'll probably stick to the traditional
[11:31] payment because there's a lot of
[11:33] expenses
[11:34] that come out of the church uh these
[11:36] next couple of months and some of those
[11:38] expenses
[11:39] are insurances due by the 30th of
[11:41] september
[11:42] and the lord has blessed us enough
[11:44] without paying you know the
[11:46] slight interest payment if you do it in
[11:48] the quarterly assessments i've been able
[11:50] to pay it off
[11:51] but including the liability in the
[11:53] building
[11:55] it's depending on any year
[11:58] it's anywhere from 38 to 39 hundred
[12:01] dollars
[12:02] and then we have the summer and winter
[12:04] fill that i do
[12:05] for the heat and that's just right
[12:07] around the corner now
[12:09] and usually depending on what we have
[12:11] left from the last year
[12:13] last year we only had like we had we
[12:15] didn't spend it all we had like
[12:17] just shy of 300 so i'll just add to that
[12:20] and it usually takes about anywhere
[12:24] from 28 to 3 800 to get through a winter
[12:27] season
[12:28] with the propane that's both for this
[12:30] building
[12:31] and the fellowship hall and then one of
[12:34] the other reasons why i won't make a lot
[12:36] of expenditures
[12:37] in august is because of the uh youth
[12:40] meetings that were
[12:41] that were wanting to have in september
[12:43] so i try to leave the general fund
[12:45] alone and i was also going to let you
[12:48] know you some of you know this
[12:50] you can tell when i get really really
[12:52] busy uh because i haven't been able to
[12:54] make a deposit in four weeks so
[12:56] tomorrow i'll make a deposit for the la
[12:59] i thought i'd let you all know
[13:01] that i'll probably be dropping a deposit
[13:03] this morning
[13:04] uh tomorrow morning for the last four
[13:07] weeks so
[13:07] i'll be honest with you i've been
[13:09] extreme i'll be honest the way it works
[13:12] every time i'm
[13:13] doing the church books on a saturday and
[13:16] i'm ready to go to the bank
[13:17] my phone just blows up for the rest of
[13:19] the day it just it's just the way it
[13:21] happens sometimes
[13:22] but if you return with me switching it
[13:25] here this morning
[13:26] if you return with me to ephesians the
[13:28] fifth chapter
[13:30] but before we we get into reading i'll
[13:32] just read this first
[13:34] but you know a thought come to me this
[13:36] morning and i was just reading this
[13:38] but i'll read a few of these verses this
[13:39] morning
[13:41] i'll try to keep my pronunciation
[13:43] correct i know i read really fast
[13:46] be there for followers of god as dear
[13:49] children
[13:51] walk in love as christ also had loved us
[13:53] and have
[13:54] given himself for us an offering and a
[13:57] sacrifice to god for our sweet smelling
[13:59] savior
[14:01] but fornication and all uncleanness and
[14:03] covetousness
[14:04] let it not be once named among you has
[14:06] become
[14:07] saints and that really speaks for our
[14:09] day that we live in
[14:10] you know god expresses us to keep
[14:12] ourselves pure
[14:13] and unspotted from the things of this
[14:15] world
[14:17] doesn't mean that you don't live out in
[14:18] the world but you take
[14:20] you take that extra step as a christian
[14:22] to make sure you don't let it defile you
[14:25] neither neither filthiness nor foolish
[14:27] talking or jesting which are not
[14:29] convenient
[14:30] but rather giving thanks for this we
[14:33] know that no whoremonger or unclean
[14:35] person or covetous man
[14:37] who is an idolater has any inheritance
[14:40] in the kingdom of christ
[14:42] and of god and i was i wrote this up
[14:45] thought down this morning and uh
[14:48] i was just thinking of the age that we
[14:50] live in every
[14:52] i wrote down some scriptures it goes
[14:54] back to the second thessalonians the
[14:55] second chapter and the 11th verse
[14:58] and it goes back to hebrews the 12th
[15:00] chapter and the 13th chapter
[15:02] with what we see this morning going on
[15:04] in in churches
[15:06] in governments in families and lives
[15:09] what's going on
[15:10] god told the people he told the hebrews
[15:13] he told christians through
[15:14] their messengers that if they didn't
[15:17] heed the word of god as it was going to
[15:19] be given to him they'll walk in the
[15:21] light as god gives him life
[15:22] that he was going to send him strong
[15:24] delusions and what we're seeing right
[15:26] now is those spirits shaking
[15:27] everything out there in the world there
[15:29] is no foundation unless you're in christ
[15:32] outside of that
[15:33] you don't have a foundation in this
[15:35] world to stand upon this morning
[15:37] and you can see it in government in
[15:39] churches i
[15:40] i don't want to be repetitive but you
[15:42] can see
[15:43] everything being shaken this morning
[15:45] that can be shaken
[15:47] and it's not being shaken like a
[15:49] earthquake a physical earthquake
[15:51] but that also means that also but in a
[15:54] spiritual sense and in a
[15:56] mind sense all the foundations that you
[15:59] once knew
[16:00] as an american citizen or you knew
[16:04] as a natural church not a real church
[16:06] believer but enough
[16:08] all those ideas everything all those
[16:11] truths are being have been shaken well
[16:13] you have no foundation to lay upon
[16:15] and it's leading the people in
[16:18] directions that you had thought that
[16:19] they would never go before so
[16:22] it's a really uh and if you go back to
[16:24] and goes also to
[16:26] second timothy the third chapter when it
[16:28] talks about the state of the age that
[16:30] we're in this morning
[16:31] we're outside of christ there is no hope
[16:33] for us you've heard the messages that
[16:35] have come from the ministers
[16:37] i mean for the last couple of months or
[16:39] the last couple of years and it's all
[16:41] got a simple proof
[16:42] principle to it you have to be in christ
[16:45] and there's
[16:45] the only hope there is i know i say that
[16:47] a lot i don't mean to
[16:49] be but i can't say it enough our only
[16:51] hope
[16:52] your only hope is in jesus christ
[16:54] outside of that if you're counting on
[16:56] anything else
[16:57] to help you get across that great divide
[17:00] one day
[17:01] just like it's not going to work but uh
[17:04] i'm gonna turn back here in my bible if
[17:06] i didn't lose my place
[17:10] but you know the the first thing that's
[17:12] been shaking
[17:14] in the world that we have this morning
[17:17] is our government is being shaken you
[17:19] have
[17:20] what it's doing in a government sense in
[17:23] a citizenship way is that you don't have
[17:27] any confidence in either party or in
[17:30] any direction that they're going because
[17:32] they lie to you
[17:34] they change their opinions they do one
[17:36] thing and yet they say another thing
[17:38] so that your trust in them is totally
[17:41] you can't trust them anymore
[17:42] you've been shaking in that aspect when
[17:45] it comes to the financial world
[17:47] they don't live by the same rules they
[17:49] want you to live by
[17:50] so they've shaken that confidence you
[17:53] might have in that
[17:54] you see churches fall and churches rise
[17:57] so
[17:57] if you're if you're just a natural
[18:00] believer
[18:01] or a make-believer you don't have no
[18:03] confidence in that
[18:04] anymore so it's made the world a
[18:07] neurotic place that it is this morning
[18:10] and the only way that you can have a
[18:11] pure mind in a sane mind
[18:14] as again i'm going to say it again but i
[18:15] can't say it enough
[18:17] he said you got to be in jesus christ
[18:19] completely you got to be sold out
[18:21] like everyone's been telling all the
[18:22] preachers have been telling you
[18:24] the last couple of weeks you've got to
[18:25] be sold out to vote jesus christ and him
[18:28] only
[18:28] but i can't you know i can't say that
[18:30] enough
[18:34] you know you you can't force yourself in
[18:36] it you just got to yield yourself into
[18:38] it
[18:39] but i'm just reading some of these
[18:41] scriptures that deal with what i was
[18:42] talking about this morning
[18:44] you know we all have to have purity of
[18:46] mind purity of spirit purity
[18:49] we just you know it's not it's a big
[18:51] word but basically you just gotta
[18:53] you gotta be what god wants you to be
[18:55] and you know i can't tell you what that
[18:57] is i can only think
[18:59] and know what god wants me to be um
[19:03] i'll just read i have this thompson
[19:05] chain reference bible so i can
[19:08] read some of these you know psalm 24 the
[19:10] third verse
[19:12] who shall ascend into the hill of the
[19:14] lord or who shall stand in this holy
[19:16] place
[19:17] who have he that hath clean hands and a
[19:20] pure heart
[19:21] and that's really important clean hands
[19:23] basically clean hands is
[19:25] that you you don't have anything to do
[19:28] with it
[19:28] it's everything that god's done for you
[19:30] to make you clean
[19:32] and a pure heart and you know that's
[19:34] what the only way you can have a pure
[19:36] heart
[19:37] is if god has changed the heart that's
[19:38] in you you have lifted up his soul
[19:41] who has not excused me i'm going to read
[19:43] this wrong who have not lifted up his
[19:45] soul onto vanity
[19:47] nor sworn deceitfully and that's totally
[19:49] opposite of this
[19:50] age people revel in the fact that they
[19:54] lie to you
[19:55] they they still harm you they cheat they
[19:57] enjoy it
[19:58] people out there in the world but you
[20:00] know that's not how we're supposed to be
[20:02] uh matthew the fifth chapter and the
[20:04] eighth verse
[20:06] you know this is the sermon of the
[20:08] beatitudes jesus said blessed are they
[20:10] are blessed are the pure heart for they
[20:13] shall see god
[20:15] and then first tim uh first timothy the
[20:17] first chapter and the fifth verse
[20:20] now the end of the commandment is
[20:22] charity of a pure heart
[20:23] and of a good conscience of faith
[20:26] unrefined
[20:27] and then this uh first timothy the fifth
[20:29] chapter and the 26th verse it says
[20:31] lay hands suddenly on no man neither be
[20:34] partake of
[20:34] other man's sin and keep thyself pure
[20:37] and when i when i look at a scripture
[20:38] like that
[20:39] that has to do with your inner reactions
[20:42] whether they're christian men or women
[20:44] or they're the men and women you work
[20:46] out there in the world with
[20:48] you you've got to be careful what you
[20:50] people
[20:51] try to lead you to do if you know it's
[20:53] wrong then you know you got to walk the
[20:55] other way
[20:56] i mean i know it's the younger you are i
[20:59] know that's a harder thing to do the
[21:01] younger you are
[21:02] it's harder to walk the turn your back
[21:04] on the crowd and go the opposite way
[21:06] when you know they're doing something
[21:08] wrong
[21:08] but if you've got christ in you leading
[21:10] you
[21:12] i'm not saying it's going to make it
[21:13] easier but it gives you the confidence
[21:16] that you're doing the right thing and
[21:18] then peter the first chapter and the
[21:20] 22nd
[21:21] seeing you have purified your souls and
[21:23] obeying the truth through the spirit
[21:25] into unframed love of the brethren see
[21:28] that you love one another with a pure
[21:30] heart and that's how
[21:31] you know everything when it comes to a
[21:33] pure heart deals with how you interact
[21:35] with other people
[21:36] you know that you don't you from a pure
[21:39] heart from a loving heart
[21:40] wanting to see people be better than
[21:42] they are at that point and then
[21:45] and then i'll just read a couple of
[21:46] these other scriptures that you know
[21:48] god's looking for us to have a spotless
[21:50] life in the things that we do
[21:53] and he goes on to say job the 11th
[21:55] chapter and the 15th verse for then
[21:57] shalt thou lift up thy
[21:58] face without spy yea thou shall be
[22:01] steadfast
[22:02] and shall not fear and then ephesians
[22:05] the fifth chapter the same chapter i was
[22:07] reading from this morning
[22:09] that he might present it to himself a
[22:12] glorious church
[22:13] not have a spot wrinkle or any such
[22:15] thing but that it should be holy and
[22:17] without blemish
[22:18] and then james the first chapter in the
[22:20] 22
[22:21] seventh verse your religion undefiled
[22:24] before god and the father is this
[22:26] to visit the followers and the widows in
[22:29] their afflictions
[22:30] and to keep himself unspotted from the
[22:32] world
[22:33] and i believe i read this one before but
[22:35] i'll read it again and finish here
[22:37] wherefore beloveds
[22:41] excuse me wherefore beloved see seeing
[22:43] that you look for such things be
[22:45] diligent that you may be found in him in
[22:47] peace
[22:48] so everyone knows what they're at this
[22:50] morning
[22:51] god knows where you're at this morning
[22:53] whatever that need is that you have or
[22:55] whatever that desire
[22:57] god knows what it is this morning and if
[22:59] it's a pure desire
[23:00] that and and it's something that you
[23:03] need from god i know that he's more than
[23:05] able to provide whatever need we have
[23:07] there
[23:07] this morning you just gotta trust them i
[23:09] know that's people say that a lot
[23:11] that's hard to do i mean i i can raise
[23:14] my hand you know i'm not
[23:15] i'm one of those people that tries to do
[23:17] everything in his own strength and
[23:19] sometimes in my own way
[23:21] but that's sometimes i wake up some
[23:23] mornings or i get into doing something
[23:25] and i realize
[23:27] that i'm not doing it the way that god
[23:29] wants me to do it i'm doing it my way
[23:31] and then you got to be man enough or
[23:34] have that enough to say hey you're wrong
[23:36] and turn around and go the way that god
[23:38] wants you to go
[23:39] brother david
[23:58] amen you love him with all your heart
[23:59] let's stand and sing that course all my

[55:58] hotter place right
[55:59] amen so for sure um
[56:02] let me see i can't think of any
[56:06] announcements i guess
[56:08] uh i'm sure brother john i'm going to
[56:10] have a meeting sometime here in the next
[56:12] couple weeks probably
[56:13] amen and so i know brother luke gibson i
[56:16] think he's gonna bring a busload of kids
[56:18] i mean i was told this morning maybe
[56:20] around 50. so looks like we're going to
[56:22] have a
[56:23] i mean good turnout amen and so
[56:26] amen it'll have to something bad will
[56:28] have to happen for us to cancel it so
[56:30] hopefully things won't get any worse we
[56:32] are trying to be a little careful i know
[56:34] we've had a few sicknesses go around
[56:36] so i've asked the deacons maybe just not
[56:38] to greet anybody coming in so that
[56:40] anybody that
[56:41] would like that it would make everybody
[56:42] more comfortable but
[56:44] other than that we'll probably keep
[56:45] going amen i
[56:47] did not get communion ready this morning
[56:50] so we won't have any
[56:51] to lord willing after uh
[56:54] be septem october probably because next
[56:57] month first of the month will be
[56:59] in our special meetings so we'll
[57:01] probably pick it up back then again

[57:08] lord in our hearts amen

[57:23] let's bow our heads kind heavenly father
[57:26] we come before you lord once again lord
[57:28] grateful
[57:29] to be able to assemble ourselves
[57:31] together lord having the right to do so
[57:33] the privilege of doing so lord and to be
[57:36] able to
[57:37] minister lord jesus according to the
[57:39] conscience
[57:40] that you have given us lord jesus
[57:42] according to your word father
[57:44] and we just ask god that you'll bless
[57:46] the meditation of our heart that which
[57:47] we feel you have laid upon our heart to
[57:49] speak
[57:50] bless each one that has made the effort
[57:51] to come out lord and we ask god that
[57:54] lord brother steve you just touch him
[57:55] and raise him up again lord and
[57:57] anybody that is sick lord we just pray
[57:59] father just touch them lord jesus
[58:01] and we just ask god that all the
[58:03] different requests lord you know each
[58:05] and every one of them we ask god for
[58:06] mercy and grace lord
[58:08] and father now as we open your word we
[58:10] ask you to bring us
[58:11] the invitation and speak through us lord
[58:14] and
[58:15] speak to us the words of eternal life we
[58:17] ask it in jesus name
[58:19] amen and amen
[58:22] amen alternative you will
[58:26] to genesis 3 genesis
[58:29] 3. amen this is a subject i spoke on
[58:34] probably many years ago but i want to
[58:36] speak on it again
[58:38] amen genesis 3
[58:45] and we'll begin with
[58:48] verse 22 and the lord god
[58:52] said behold the man
[58:56] is become one of us
[59:00] to know good and evil and now least he
[59:02] put forth his hand
[59:04] and take also of the tree of life and
[59:07] eat and live forever
[59:09] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[59:11] from the garden of eden
[59:13] to till the ground from whence he was
[59:16] taken
[59:16] so he drove out the man and placed at
[59:19] the east of the garden of eden
[59:20] cherubims and a flaming sword
[59:24] with which turned every way to keep the
[59:26] way
[59:27] of life now over in the book of
[59:30] ephesians
[59:32] book of ephesians the second chapter
[59:48] ephesians 2 and we'll go 12-14
[59:52] that at that time ye were
[59:55] without christ being aliens from the
[59:58] commonwealth of israel
[1:00:00] and strangers from the covenants of
[1:00:02] promise
[1:00:03] having no hope and without god in the
[1:00:07] world
[1:00:08] but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes
[1:00:11] were
[1:00:11] afar off are made nigh
[1:00:14] by the blood of christ he is our peace
[1:00:19] who have made both one and hath broken
[1:00:22] down the middle wall
[1:00:24] of partition between us amen may god add
[1:00:27] his blessings to the reading of the word
[1:00:29] you can be seated this
[1:00:31] amen i seem to be fading out
[1:00:36] a little bit
[1:00:41] i want to title this the barrier
[1:00:45] breaker the barrier breaker amen
[1:00:50] and basically we want to talk about
[1:00:52] barriers amen this morning for a while
[1:00:54] would that be okay
[1:00:56] let's talk about barriers for a while
[1:00:58] amen and
[1:00:59] i begin to think about all the different
[1:01:01] barriers
[1:01:02] that life has and there's a lot of
[1:01:05] different ones amen and so we certainly
[1:01:07] don't
[1:01:07] think that we'll have time to but just
[1:01:10] touch on maybe
[1:01:11] five or six of them perhaps but i got to
[1:01:13] think about the first
[1:01:15] barrier that ever was
[1:01:18] amen was caused by the devil
[1:01:21] amen isn't that right and
[1:01:25] the first barrier that god had to put up
[1:01:27] was right there
[1:01:28] in genesis you know right so he put a
[1:01:31] flaming sword and so forth and
[1:01:34] a sword that turns both ways he drove
[1:01:36] them out of the garden of eden
[1:01:38] and said you know unless he takes of the
[1:01:40] tree of life also and lives
[1:01:42] you know we all have to protect this
[1:01:44] amen you cannot come back into the
[1:01:46] presence of god and eat of the tree of
[1:01:48] life
[1:01:49] and live forever amen because of the sin
[1:01:51] that they had committed
[1:01:53] now uh
[1:01:56] and then i also read there in ephesians
[1:01:58] talking about how that
[1:02:00] god between israel and the gentiles that
[1:02:04] god had taken a wall down
[1:02:06] you know we know that it all is a
[1:02:08] partition right
[1:02:09] a wall is something that divides
[1:02:12] amen and so that's what it was with
[1:02:16] uh you know what what happened there was
[1:02:19] uh god had to put up a wall and but
[1:02:22] satan
[1:02:23] caused it he actually caused them to get
[1:02:26] a place of sin amen and and not be right
[1:02:30] with god
[1:02:30] and have to be separated from the
[1:02:33] presence
[1:02:34] of god amen and that was that was a very
[1:02:37] very tragic thing because we know that
[1:02:40] for
[1:02:41] almost 4 000 years that barrier
[1:02:45] was up is i right and
[1:02:48] i believe it was in the seal of god
[1:02:50] brother branham talks about
[1:02:51] how that those angels in that in that
[1:02:54] time in genesis how that they
[1:02:56] kept the way of life and kept you out
[1:02:59] but he says you know after pentecost and
[1:03:01] after calvary
[1:03:02] those angels now were saying come on in
[1:03:05] come on in come on
[1:03:06] in and that right come to the tree of
[1:03:09] life
[1:03:10] amen because that barrier was taken away
[1:03:12] in christ that barrier that we had
[1:03:15] amen and being away from god
[1:03:18] and it was a terrible thing because they
[1:03:20] could never get back they could not get
[1:03:22] back to where they were
[1:03:24] amen and i began to think about this and
[1:03:26] how that there's a lot of
[1:03:28] so many different barriers in life and i
[1:03:30] got to thinking about the interstate
[1:03:32] system
[1:03:32] and i don't know about you but i like
[1:03:34] the interstate system amen they created
[1:03:36] the interstate system and you know when
[1:03:38] you get
[1:03:38] going on a road you're supposed to be
[1:03:41] able to go from one point to the other
[1:03:43] amen and never have to stop
[1:03:46] amen not have to stop just keep right on
[1:03:50] going unfortunately today
[1:03:52] that's just not true is it amen because
[1:03:55] of all the traffic jams and everything
[1:03:57] and all the road work and they'll put up
[1:03:59] barricades and they'll put up uh walls
[1:04:02] and things like that to make you go down
[1:04:04] to one lane and they'll squish you in
[1:04:06] wherever they want to go and
[1:04:07] and all these things it's all it's a
[1:04:09] it's actually these barriers push you
[1:04:12] into
[1:04:12] amend certain lanes or down the one lane
[1:04:15] and then you get slow and so forth
[1:04:16] you know and i got to thinking about how
[1:04:18] that that's the same thing that happened
[1:04:20] there
[1:04:20] amen in genesis how they got forced into
[1:04:23] its condition
[1:04:24] into a situation that they couldn't get
[1:04:26] out of
[1:04:27] amen amen they got in a bad place
[1:04:31] because of
[1:04:32] sin amen now we know sin itself you know
[1:04:35] it is also a barrier how many knows it's
[1:04:37] superior it's called the sin barrier
[1:04:39] that god called
[1:04:42] that sin barrier now we'll maybe talk
[1:04:44] about it here a little bit later but you
[1:04:45] know that's the worst barrier of all
[1:04:48] is the sin barrier amen it's what
[1:04:50] actually keeps people
[1:04:52] separated from god amen
[1:04:55] and so but the devil causes it now
[1:04:58] there's a lot of different chara
[1:04:59] a lot of different things you know and
[1:05:01] and the devil he likes to put up
[1:05:03] roadblocks
[1:05:05] he likes to cause division
[1:05:08] he likes to bring a barriers
[1:05:12] between people isn't that right
[1:05:16] is i call it the indifference
[1:05:18] indifference barriers
[1:05:20] because we're all different a lot of
[1:05:23] times we we could talk about the race
[1:05:25] barriers
[1:05:27] how that there's so many different races
[1:05:29] uh you know there's a red
[1:05:31] black well i don't even know all the
[1:05:34] colors i guess right now
[1:05:36] yellow and white isn't that right all
[1:05:37] the different creases there is and
[1:05:40] and always the language barriers people
[1:05:43] you know
[1:05:43] people go to rattling on the
[1:05:44] conscientious of us
[1:05:47] because since episodes saw us in
[1:05:53] our vacuums for saying what team's all
[1:05:54] been we've got one hand to understand
[1:05:56] back a few there
[1:05:58] right but there's an area that if you
[1:05:59] don't understand that language it's all
[1:06:01] a bunch of gibberish
[1:06:03] and all right and so there's a barrier
[1:06:05] there but guess what
[1:06:06] you know it conservative cell and then
[1:06:08] all of a sudden i talk that well i
[1:06:10] understand that perfectly good right
[1:06:12] you don't understand one it's like wow
[1:06:14] that's what i like to hear
[1:06:16] amen and so we find there's all kinds of
[1:06:18] different ones but
[1:06:19] you know one thing about it is and god
[1:06:22] does put up separations
[1:06:24] you know right he does burn up some laws
[1:06:26] he does because
[1:06:28] god's word calls for a total separation
[1:06:30] from unbelief
[1:06:32] then we have also barriers of uh what i
[1:06:35] call the birds of a feather
[1:06:36] amen because as the prophet of god said
[1:06:39] you know that birds of a feather
[1:06:40] flock together a unbeliever and a
[1:06:43] believer
[1:06:44] have how much in common they don't have
[1:06:47] nothing in common why because the
[1:06:49] unbeliever he likes to drink he likes to
[1:06:50] smoke
[1:06:51] amen and he likes to cast up but like
[1:06:54] excuse me
[1:06:55] he likes to cuss and use terrible words
[1:06:58] and that's not something you like
[1:07:00] to hear you don't like to be around we
[1:07:02] just don't have a lot to talk about if
[1:07:04] you're going to talk about smoking or
[1:07:05] drinking or partying and all of that
[1:07:07] amen i like to talk about oh my didn't
[1:07:10] we have a good church service wednesday
[1:07:11] night
[1:07:12] then we have a good service didn't god
[1:07:13] speak
[1:07:15] see that's what i'm talking about and
[1:07:17] but the mother unbelievers they'd be
[1:07:19] like oh man i don't want to go to church
[1:07:20] you know because my
[1:07:22] man he's going to condemn me and down my
[1:07:25] soul to hell and everything else and
[1:07:26] i'll be damned and i don't want to hear
[1:07:28] all that
[1:07:30] you know and so that's why we have
[1:07:32] believers amen there's a barrier
[1:07:34] between believers and unbelievers but
[1:07:37] you know the thing of it is what i like
[1:07:39] this morning is that
[1:07:40] if we walk in the light as he is
[1:07:43] in the light huh
[1:07:47] now i want you to notice the word w-e
[1:07:51] all right we right that's more than one
[1:07:54] that's us if we amen me and you
[1:07:58] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:08:01] light
[1:08:02] then we have what how many knows there's
[1:08:06] a fellowship barrier
[1:08:08] amen darkness has no
[1:08:11] fellowship with light light has no
[1:08:14] fellowship
[1:08:15] with darkness praise be to god
[1:08:20] amen and but the thing of it is if
[1:08:24] two people walk together in the light
[1:08:28] they will have fellowship
[1:08:36] i don't care how much i get at odds with
[1:08:39] you i don't care how much of a spat
[1:08:41] or a fight that you and i have i'll tell
[1:08:44] you what
[1:08:44] we don't talk to each other for weeks
[1:08:46] maybe maybe i
[1:08:48] don't know are you listening
[1:08:52] but i guarantee it it's one thing that
[1:08:54] if we get back under the blood if we get
[1:08:56] out to back
[1:08:57] walking in the light amen then guess
[1:09:00] what
[1:09:00] we will have fellowship again
[1:09:05] because the blood of jesus christ
[1:09:08] cleanses us from all
[1:09:10] unrighteousness but now if i
[1:09:12] stay out of the light i see out from
[1:09:15] under the blood
[1:09:16] you might get under the blood and say
[1:09:18] brother i'm sorry that i did you wrong
[1:09:21] amen but if i'm not under the blood boy
[1:09:22] you ought to
[1:09:26] you was wrong that's right you were
[1:09:29] wrong
[1:09:30] and you're terrible you know now i gotta
[1:09:33] go
[1:09:34] huh on one part somebody's under the
[1:09:37] blood but the other guy is not coming
[1:09:39] under the blood because if he came under
[1:09:41] the blood
[1:09:42] he would say you know i was wrong too
[1:09:48] i'm sorry for this i didn't you know and
[1:09:51] then you'd have fellowship again but if
[1:09:53] one person does not come under the blood
[1:09:55] if one person don't get to walk it back
[1:09:57] in the light you have no fellowship
[1:10:05] [Music]
[1:10:06] oh my oh what a savior they're saying
[1:10:09] that's special about we have a savior
[1:10:11] aren't you glad that you've got
[1:10:13] fellowship this morning
[1:10:15] you know folks how many of us will say
[1:10:17] this morning that we were kind of hoping
[1:10:20] and then we're kind of looking and we're
[1:10:21] all hoping that things will get better
[1:10:27] we just love for inflation to come back
[1:10:30] down
[1:10:31] i'd love for a two by four cost twelve
[1:10:33] dollars but maybe three dollars like it
[1:10:36] used to
[1:10:38] huh amen i'd like for all of that to
[1:10:42] happen but from the looks of it how many
[1:10:44] knows
[1:10:45] that it's probably just not gonna get
[1:10:48] better
[1:10:53] oh we'd like for cover to all be gone
[1:10:56] and we
[1:10:57] you know we'd like to get back to normal
[1:11:02] but it's probably just not going to
[1:11:04] happen
[1:11:06] huh because if it ain't it'll be
[1:11:09] something else
[1:11:10] amen because how many knows that we're
[1:11:12] it's going to be at a time
[1:11:15] of trouble
[1:11:18] it is we're living now in the days of a
[1:11:20] time of trouble
[1:11:22] amen are you thinking about the united
[1:11:24] states in trouble therein but you got to
[1:11:26] realize something
[1:11:27] that this whole world is in trouble
[1:11:33] amen and let me tell you something like
[1:11:35] brother brown says there truly is
[1:11:37] absolutely no hope except for in jesus
[1:11:40] christ
[1:11:41] that's the only hope there is there
[1:11:43] ain't no other hope
[1:11:47] oh i was thinking yesterday's you know
[1:11:49] of how to
[1:11:50] maybe you enjoy your farm maybe you
[1:11:52] enjoy this that of the other but you
[1:11:53] realize that you're made out of the dust
[1:11:56] and you're going to go back to the dust
[1:11:59] the only chance you have is christ
[1:12:02] oh man and you think boy i'd like this
[1:12:04] to last forever but nothing lasts
[1:12:06] forever in this world
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:10] it's all temporary all this will be
[1:12:13] history
[1:12:14] and it's getting together like this one
[1:12:16] day all billion
[1:12:17] it'll be history
[1:12:21] i was thinking back in the office and
[1:12:22] there's three ways out of it i'm getting
[1:12:24] somewhere
[1:12:25] there's three ways out of here huh
[1:12:28] that's to pass away before the rapture
[1:12:30] comes
[1:12:32] or to go into rapture
[1:12:35] or to have to go through the tribulation
[1:12:37] period
[1:12:38] huh that's the only three ways out of
[1:12:41] here
[1:12:43] but i don't know about you but i like i
[1:12:46] want
[1:12:46] something that is forever and lasts
[1:12:49] forever how many want something to last
[1:12:53] forever
[1:12:54] and we don't realize that that is
[1:12:56] eternal life
[1:12:58] that god came to give us eternal life
[1:13:02] he offered it to the world you and i oh
[1:13:04] my if i was
[1:13:05] if you've never heard it before if
[1:13:07] you've never heard this here this
[1:13:09] morning what i'm fixing to say ever
[1:13:11] before you would probably really
[1:13:14] get to thinking about it is that god
[1:13:17] offers to you
[1:13:18] this morning eternal life
[1:13:22] eternal life isn't that right
[1:13:26] to live eternally for things never to
[1:13:29] stop
[1:13:29] for things not to pass away
[1:13:34] oh my then when i thought about
[1:13:38] in the midst of all this amen
[1:13:42] really having only a promise of things
[1:13:44] getting worse because remember that
[1:13:47] the bible talks that it will be in a
[1:13:48] time of trouble like there was never
[1:13:50] since the foundation of the world
[1:13:52] that israel will be delivered
[1:13:55] tribulation period
[1:13:57] it's going to get worse worse and worse
[1:13:59] you thought the mark of the beast was
[1:14:00] going to come in when everybody's got
[1:14:01] plenty of money everything's going good
[1:14:04] huh folks
[1:14:07] we've got to spend more money we got to
[1:14:09] get in a tighter pitch
[1:14:12] i think they're about to do it huh they
[1:14:15] got to make it worse before
[1:14:17] something's going to happen so where
[1:14:20] they can bring in that mark of the beast
[1:14:21] nobody buy or sell
[1:14:24] huh but the thing when i thought about
[1:14:27] that when i thought about there is no
[1:14:29] hope in this world and then that you
[1:14:31] think that you have the god of hope
[1:14:36] amen that if you pass away you drop dead
[1:14:39] before i'm done preaching this morning
[1:14:41] god has a place jesus says i go and i
[1:14:44] prepare
[1:14:45] a place for you aren't you glad this
[1:14:47] morning that god's got a place prepared
[1:14:49] for you
[1:14:51] amen that if this barrier of this veil
[1:14:53] of this flesh drops amen you're going to
[1:14:56] come over to the other side of that
[1:14:57] barrier
[1:14:58] and it's going to be unlike what you
[1:14:59] could ever imagine
[1:15:01] how many knows heaven is unimaginable
[1:15:04] but yet we here keep our mind too much
[1:15:06] on the things
[1:15:06] that temporal and not the things that's
[1:15:09] unimaginable
[1:15:10] beautiful
[1:15:17] we take it for granted
[1:15:22] we're so busy with our fortune we forgot
[1:15:24] what jesus said
[1:15:26] amen oh my
[1:15:30] that was a good message brother and i
[1:15:32] brother brad
[1:15:33] amen i appreciate brother brad and his
[1:15:35] ministry
[1:15:37] praise the lord so listen so the devil
[1:15:40] causes
[1:15:42] all kinds of barriers
[1:15:46] my but it's a struggle
[1:15:51] but this morning i got to thinking about
[1:15:53] it
[1:15:54] and i thought about how good god is to
[1:15:56] us
[1:15:58] how wonderful it is to think that you
[1:16:00] have fellowship with almighty god
[1:16:02] that you're a child of god amen
[1:16:07] that it made me think you know lord we
[1:16:10] preach a lot
[1:16:11] we do a lot but really
[1:16:14] in my heart i feel like i just want to
[1:16:18] thank
[1:16:20] you lord i just wanna thank you
[1:16:24] lord for saving my soul making me whole
[1:16:29] thank you lord amen
[1:16:32] i believe that we ought to spend more
[1:16:34] time thanking god
[1:16:36] praising god being appreciative of god
[1:16:39] of what he is and what he means to you
[1:16:43] oh my praise be to god
[1:16:48] let's talk about another veil found in
[1:16:51] first corinthians
[1:16:55] the veil that god has put
[1:16:59] now how many knows that a veil is
[1:17:01] something that's perhaps
[1:17:02] like moses put a veil over his face so
[1:17:04] he can't see it it's a barrier
[1:17:07] that's what a veil is it's a barrier
[1:17:14] and in second corinthians the third
[1:17:16] chapter
[1:17:26] and verse 13. not as moses
[1:17:30] which put oh put a veil over his face
[1:17:33] that the children of israel could not
[1:17:35] steadfastly look to the end
[1:17:37] of that which is abolish but their minds
[1:17:40] were blinded
[1:17:41] for until this day remain at the same
[1:17:43] veil on taken away in a reading of the
[1:17:46] old testament
[1:17:47] which veil was done away in christ
[1:17:51] but even unto this day now notice paul
[1:17:54] saying even unto this day
[1:17:57] he says when mo that the veil is upon
[1:17:59] their hearts
[1:18:01] nevertheless when it shall return to the
[1:18:03] lord that veil
[1:18:05] shall be taken away now how many know
[1:18:08] that
[1:18:09] israel as a nation was blind
[1:18:12] right they had a veil over their eyes
[1:18:15] and they just
[1:18:16] will not and they cannot see
[1:18:19] that jesus was the messiah
[1:18:23] can you imagine a veil that has lasted
[1:18:25] for the last
[1:18:26] 2 000 years and they have wandered
[1:18:30] through the nexus just like the
[1:18:31] scripture said they would
[1:18:32] because of rejecting the messiah amen
[1:18:34] they have wandered through the nations
[1:18:36] because of all their stubbornness and
[1:18:38] everything they've done
[1:18:40] huh being killed by the millions by
[1:18:44] hitler and so forth driven back to their
[1:18:47] homeland and they still
[1:18:49] oh my just can't see it
[1:18:55] that is the worst barrier of all it's
[1:18:58] just not being able to see it
[1:19:02] why do you think jesus said blessed are
[1:19:05] your eyes
[1:19:06] for they say
[1:19:09] oh my because i'll tell you what like
[1:19:11] like the prophet god said if you
[1:19:13] inherited a great big
[1:19:15] uh factory and so forth or whatever it
[1:19:18] is a warehouse and then had everything
[1:19:20] imaginable in there
[1:19:21] amen it wouldn't do you one bit of good
[1:19:23] if you can't get inside the building
[1:19:26] and that's the way it is with christ it
[1:19:28] doesn't do you a bit of good if you
[1:19:30] can't get inside of the building
[1:19:32] do you realize that people in
[1:19:34] denominations and so forth amen they can
[1:19:36] only go so far because they don't
[1:19:38] believe the full word of god
[1:19:41] because with the fullness of the word
[1:19:43] comes the full birth of jesus christ
[1:19:46] comes the full blessing of almighty god
[1:19:48] and israel could not see it they were
[1:19:50] blinded
[1:19:50] amen to this day they won't hear the
[1:19:53] gospel
[1:19:54] because they have that veil taken over
[1:19:56] put over their eyes
[1:19:58] how many of us gentiles we're not
[1:19:59] supposed to have a veil over our eyes
[1:20:02] we're supposed to have our eyes wide
[1:20:04] open
[1:20:06] praise be to god and that's what paul
[1:20:08] was saying in ephesians there
[1:20:09] he says listen that we
[1:20:12] at that time we were without christ we
[1:20:15] were aliens from the commonwealth of
[1:20:17] israel
[1:20:18] in other words god had a chosen people
[1:20:20] how many knows that
[1:20:22] that was his people and i'll tell you
[1:20:24] what he didn't deal with you
[1:20:26] he didn't deal with me i don't know if i
[1:20:29] was a greek i don't know if
[1:20:30] just what i was we were anglo-saxons but
[1:20:33] you know just what we were just gentiles
[1:20:36] like the prophet said we carried clubs
[1:20:37] on our back and we didn't believe god
[1:20:39] we worshiped idols and everything else
[1:20:43] in the book
[1:20:44] listen paul says that we were without
[1:20:47] hope
[1:20:48] without god in the world
[1:20:52] my what a terrible place for us to be
[1:20:55] and we had no connection
[1:20:58] with god we had no connection with
[1:21:00] israel
[1:21:02] amen
[1:21:05] but listen but paul says but now in
[1:21:08] christ jesus you
[1:21:09] who were sometimes way off
[1:21:15] are made nigh by the blood of
[1:21:18] jesus christ amen for he is our peace
[1:21:22] who have
[1:21:23] made both one and has broken down that
[1:21:26] middle wall of petition between
[1:21:28] us in other words he has broken down
[1:21:31] amen that divider that divided the
[1:21:33] gentiles
[1:21:34] from acquiring fellowship with god
[1:21:42] and like my brother said last time he
[1:21:44] talked about how that their blinds were
[1:21:46] blinded since you and i could come in
[1:21:48] that wasn't just for a day or two
[1:21:50] that's been the last 2000 years
[1:21:53] but one of these days paul said
[1:21:56] that god's going to take that veil away
[1:21:58] one of these days
[1:22:00] and then it's like trying to explain
[1:22:02] somebody some something to somebody and
[1:22:04] if you're like me
[1:22:05] sometimes you have to have to explain
[1:22:06] about the third time you finally get
[1:22:08] before you finally get it now exactly
[1:22:10] what was it did she said how would you
[1:22:12] oh my
[1:22:15] but all of a sudden you'll say oh yeah
[1:22:18] yeah okay i see
[1:22:22] and that's what iz going to do when
[1:22:24] their eyes are open when god lives that
[1:22:26] veil
[1:22:28] did you ever try to preach the gospel to
[1:22:29] somebody tell them about the message of
[1:22:31] the hour or whatever
[1:22:32] amen and boy even people amen who
[1:22:35] believe in the trinity if they have that
[1:22:37] evil trinity spirit
[1:22:42] you realize those folks will
[1:22:43] excommunicate and everything else
[1:22:45] if you baptize in the name of the lord
[1:22:46] jesus christ and they think it's
[1:22:47] supposed to be false on the holy ghost
[1:22:49] they got an attitude with it huh
[1:22:53] and they're so hard you just can't get
[1:22:55] in there
[1:22:58] oh my people have that barrier amen
[1:23:01] a barrier of unbelief and most of the
[1:23:03] times according to the brother to god it
[1:23:05] is because of
[1:23:06] previous teaching their teaching of
[1:23:08] their mom their dad
[1:23:09] or their church well we aren't taught it
[1:23:12] that way
[1:23:13] that's not the point the point is that
[1:23:16] if you're of god you
[1:23:18] love the truth of god
[1:23:21] you come to the word of god if you are
[1:23:24] god's child
[1:23:26] amen but i thank god this morning
[1:23:30] that you don't have that level
[1:23:34] can i just what say what i don't have
[1:23:36] wrote down just comes to mind have you
[1:23:38] eye
[1:23:41] i believe there's those who think their
[1:23:44] eyes are open
[1:23:46] who think they do see but they're still
[1:23:49] completely blind
[1:23:52] that's scary
[1:23:56] we know that's the truth out there in
[1:23:58] the domination world
[1:23:59] but especially even amongst the message
[1:24:02] huh
[1:24:03] because how many knows your life proves
[1:24:05] who you are
[1:24:08] it proves who you are
[1:24:14] how many beliefs that's why we ought to
[1:24:16] inspect ourselves see if we are in the
[1:24:18] faith or whether we're not
[1:24:19] see if our life bears the fruit of the
[1:24:22] spirit
[1:24:22] amen see if it copes up with the word or
[1:24:26] if you're
[1:24:26] really just a hypocrite
[1:24:28] [Music]
[1:24:32] i wonder i wonder this morning if a
[1:24:35] hypocrite really knows he's a hypocrite
[1:24:39] because it would seem like if he was he
[1:24:41] wanted quit being hypocrite
[1:24:44] amen unless he's just happy being that
[1:24:46] way but most of the time it's they're
[1:24:47] blind they don't see
[1:24:48] their own fault my
[1:24:52] and you know what the bible declares
[1:24:54] there'll be millions there
[1:24:56] that thought they were right and they
[1:24:58] weren't
[1:25:00] so god help us because only the elect
[1:25:02] won't be deceived
[1:25:04] the bible says it would be so deceiving
[1:25:06] that if it was possible
[1:25:08] the elect would be deceived was it billy
[1:25:10] graham
[1:25:12] i'm thinking with billy graham brother
[1:25:13] brown said it was going out there and
[1:25:15] preaching that eve saw deceiving even
[1:25:17] the elect that are being deceived
[1:25:20] and he begged to differ letterbomb said
[1:25:22] i beg to differ with him on that
[1:25:25] that's not scriptural the bible says if
[1:25:28] it was possible the elect would be
[1:25:31] deceived but it's not because they're
[1:25:32] delayed
[1:25:33] they'll have their eyes open i believe
[1:25:36] that to go to the rapture you're going
[1:25:38] to have that little specialized site
[1:25:40] amen that little eyesight folks
[1:25:44] it isn't to see everybody else's fault
[1:25:47] you know that specialized side is going
[1:25:48] to have
[1:25:49] 20 20 vision back at you those three
[1:25:52] fingers that point back at you see
[1:25:54] god where am i at with you
[1:25:58] how do i look to you lord open my eyes
[1:26:02] take that veil away praise be to god
[1:26:07] aren't you glad for that veil that was
[1:26:08] taken away
[1:26:10] you know man wanted to see god man that
[1:26:13] worship god
[1:26:14] israel worship god right and then they
[1:26:16] went into the temple
[1:26:18] and now there are three barriers i've
[1:26:20] got that back there yet
[1:26:22] but there was a first court with the
[1:26:24] labor and the sacrifice place to burn
[1:26:26] the offering and so forth
[1:26:28] it was the second building so to speak
[1:26:30] that had this candlesticks on it and the
[1:26:31] shoe bread and so forth
[1:26:33] and then behind that one was badger skin
[1:26:35] isn't that right
[1:26:36] a whole big old curtain made out of
[1:26:38] badger skin
[1:26:41] amen and anybody that kept it behind
[1:26:44] that
[1:26:44] drop dead outside of moses or those who
[1:26:48] were special anointed
[1:26:50] how many knows when you got in behind
[1:26:53] that second barrier before you go back
[1:26:55] behind that barrier
[1:26:59] you had this walk a certain pace
[1:27:02] no doubt but your head had to be a
[1:27:04] certain way you had to have the bells
[1:27:06] you had to have the right
[1:27:08] lower clothes you had the right to have
[1:27:09] upper clothes you had to have the right
[1:27:11] anointing on you
[1:27:13] everything had to be right because if oh
[1:27:16] my
[1:27:19] am i wrong or did they put the rope on
[1:27:20] his leg just in case he did drop dead
[1:27:22] nobody else would
[1:27:23] take you know they'd have to take him
[1:27:25] back out of there because if they went
[1:27:26] in they'd die too so nobody
[1:27:28] we'd have a bunch of bad people in there
[1:27:31] put something on here hey if he ain't
[1:27:33] quite right god ain't happy with it
[1:27:35] he'll drop dead
[1:27:39] and yet you have the holy spirit right
[1:27:40] in your heart
[1:27:42] how many knows they were praising god
[1:27:46] with
[1:27:46] abraham and they were saying abraham is
[1:27:49] our father
[1:27:50] our father and moses is our prophet and
[1:27:52] so forth and
[1:27:53] all they disputed with jesus and so
[1:27:55] forth
[1:27:57] and after calvary
[1:28:00] knows that when jesus died what happened
[1:28:03] when he died
[1:28:03] when he flamin when he passed away when
[1:28:06] he died
[1:28:07] the bible says that there was an
[1:28:08] earthquake and that veil
[1:28:10] was rent it was torn too
[1:28:17] because they were saying where's my god
[1:28:18] where's our god where's our god
[1:28:21] amen but they didn't realize that he was
[1:28:23] on calvary
[1:28:25] in plain view
[1:28:28] that's where that song comes from be all
[1:28:30] behold the man of sorrows oh behold him
[1:28:32] in plain view
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:34] oh somebody wrote a song about it
[1:28:37] holiday was in plain view and they
[1:28:40] couldn't see them
[1:28:41] [Music]
[1:28:42] but when that veil was rent god said
[1:28:45] come on in now we can have boldness
[1:28:47] you can come boldly before the throne of
[1:28:49] god by the precious blood of jesus
[1:28:51] christ
[1:28:54] but you got to come just a certain way
[1:28:57] amen that only accepts you a certain way
[1:29:01] my wife she's been following facebook
[1:29:03] and so forth and
[1:29:06] a few statements that people will make
[1:29:09] even my relatives i hope they're
[1:29:10] listening this morning
[1:29:12] people that'll say god will accept you
[1:29:15] and love you
[1:29:16] just the way you are you ain't got to
[1:29:19] change he loves you just the way you are
[1:29:24] a certain point yeah he does love you
[1:29:25] the way you are
[1:29:27] sure he loves you but if you think
[1:29:30] you're going to come to god
[1:29:32] and stay the way you are
[1:29:37] what came to my mind i says honey well
[1:29:39] look at this way
[1:29:41] let me see israel after the resurrection
[1:29:45] after peter went began to preach on the
[1:29:47] day of pentecost
[1:29:48] after he told him you his wicked hearts
[1:29:51] and hands have killed
[1:29:52] the christ and so forth and god has
[1:29:54] raised him back up
[1:29:56] and they all said well what can we do to
[1:29:59] be saved y'all wanted to come back to
[1:30:01] god they wanted to be saved
[1:30:04] right and they said many better what
[1:30:06] shall we
[1:30:07] do and peter said god accepts you just
[1:30:10] the way you are
[1:30:12] is that what he said stay just how you
[1:30:15] are god loves homosexuals he loves
[1:30:17] lesbians he loves whatever it is
[1:30:20] he accepts you and you can just stay
[1:30:22] that way no he did not
[1:30:23] he said the first thing you've got to do
[1:30:25] is to repent
[1:30:28] first thing you've got to do is turn
[1:30:29] away from all your wicked ways
[1:30:31] get rid of your set goals depart from
[1:30:34] iniquity and i will receive you saith
[1:30:36] god

[1:30:39] willing to do is stop everything you're
[1:30:41] doing wrong
[1:30:42] you've got to completely change and die
[1:30:45] to yourself
[1:30:46] or you'll never come
[1:30:50] it's nothing but the devil's doctrine
[1:30:53] that
[1:30:53] is the devil's doctrine
[1:30:56] god loves us all just how we are
[1:31:00] huh no he doesn't say look i want you to
[1:31:04] start doing this right and that this

[1:34:04] little
[1:34:06] breaking through the sound barrier
[1:34:10] amen how about beliefs
[1:34:13] that's what we need get on our knees
[1:34:16] say lord take me through that sound
[1:34:18] barrier amen

[1:34:22] unbelief
[1:34:26] oh the devil will tell you i don't care
[1:34:29] how long you've been a christian
[1:34:30] you ain't really christian you think
[1:34:33] you're a son of god but you're not
[1:34:34] really
[1:34:35] look what you did look at your smart gun
[1:34:37] oh he's a master
[1:34:39] at pointing you to your faults
[1:34:42] jesus is a master at pointing you to
[1:34:44] calvary
[1:34:46] he's a master and not pointing you to
[1:34:49] yourself but pointing to him
[1:34:51] and what he's done hallelujah
[1:34:55] aren't you glad for that praise be to
[1:34:59] god
[1:35:01] but we gotta get past that sometimes it
[1:35:03] takes
[1:35:05] prayer it takes a little time for us to
[1:35:07] just
[1:35:09] get beside ourselves i'm gonna let the
[1:35:11] glory roll when the road
[1:35:13] is called in glory i'm gonna get beside
[1:35:16] of myself when i get beside of myself
[1:35:19] amen my this flesh
[1:35:23] this flesh pulls you down the holy ghost
[1:35:26] lifts you this is always a this is such
[1:35:30] a
[1:35:30] downer huh
[1:35:34] it always desires the wrong thing that's
[1:35:37] why the bible says not fulfilling
[1:35:39] lust of your flesh and of the mind
[1:35:42] everything you can think of don't
[1:35:45] satisfy that
[1:35:46] don't satisfy the desires of this flesh
[1:35:49] why because it's wrong
[1:35:53] oh my people want to say well you can do
[1:35:56] whatever you want to god loves you
[1:35:57] anyway
[1:36:00] boy you're weaker is weaker than eve
[1:36:03] ever thought about me
[1:36:05] it took a lot more than that to deceive
[1:36:07] her
[1:36:08] he had to come down to just one word to
[1:36:11] preach the whole gospel except
[1:36:12] one little word that ain't even anything
[1:36:14] or here or close to one word
[1:36:18] you love him aren't you glad that dale
[1:36:21] was rent and now the flaming sword
[1:36:27] that flaming what is the sword the sword
[1:36:30] of the word
[1:36:31] the fiery word says come on back
[1:36:36] says come into christ come into christ
[1:36:38] come into christ it's the only place of
[1:36:40] refuge
[1:36:43] that barrier has been taken down amen
[1:36:49] but we love our chicken coops
[1:36:53] we love our barriers we know what we can
[1:36:57] do
[1:36:58] and what we can't do i like that
[1:37:02] don't kids like that kids like that well
[1:37:05] i know that if i don't take that garbage
[1:37:07] out of that he says

[1:37:13] said stick the garbage up yes daddy grab
[1:37:15] it and go out there no problem
[1:37:18] we like our barriers but you know
[1:37:19] sometimes god does something different
[1:37:21] it's not just a certain box huh
[1:37:25] like brother bam says you know it takes
[1:37:27] a mason mason can lay a straight line
[1:37:30] or anybody can lay a straight line but
[1:37:31] he says it takes a real mason to turn

[1:37:36] corner lead
[1:37:37] i remember years ago woody when i

[1:38:48] you are okay come start tomorrow
[1:38:50] forget all the riff raff recruit the
[1:38:52] apprenticeship
[1:38:54] and right from there i'll leave
[1:38:55] everybody for a while you know how we
[1:38:57] are
[1:38:59] but that's how i got the limbach i
[1:39:01] realized hey i can do this
[1:39:03] i don't have to do this i can do this
[1:39:04] but i can't do it for this guy
[1:39:06] he wants to work in that some other
[1:39:08] channel
[1:39:10] but it takes a corner to taste a real
[1:39:12] mason let me tell you something how he
[1:39:13] believes
[1:39:14] it takes a real child of god to turn the
[1:39:16] corner and the israelites couldn't turn
[1:39:18] that corner how many knows when the
[1:39:20] messiah came
[1:39:21] they want to keep on going they wanted
[1:39:23] to keep their priesthood they wanted to
[1:39:24] be the big shots in the church
[1:39:27] they want pride in everything else when
[1:39:29] it was time to humble themselves
[1:39:31] and fall before jesus chao physicists
[1:39:34] and all of them guys need to fall down
[1:39:36] like this and say jesus i worship you i
[1:39:39] believe
[1:39:40] you're the son of god i believe you're
[1:39:41] the messiah that was to come
[1:39:43] that's what they should have done but
[1:39:46] instead they called him beelzebub
[1:39:50] huh oh jesus
[1:39:54] i believe that you are god
[1:39:58] that's too much for churches today even
[1:40:00] they don't think he was god
[1:40:02] remember thomas said my lord and my god
[1:40:06] and jesus never said no no don't call me
[1:40:08] that that's for the father somewhere
[1:40:10] else
[1:40:11] jesus never refuted it because the
[1:40:13] fullness of the godhead
[1:40:15] dwelled in him bodily
[1:40:18] even the disciples didn't understand his
[1:40:20] father stuff all the time
[1:40:22] i mean you know she took a little
[1:40:23] explaining took a little revelation to
[1:40:25] understand the godhead
[1:40:27] and he says you mean i've been with you
[1:40:28] so long and you still don't know me
[1:40:30] huh he says if you've seen me
[1:40:34] you've seen the father for it's not me
[1:40:36] that does the works
[1:40:38] but it's the father that's up there huh
[1:40:41] did he say that no it's the father that
[1:40:45] dwelleth in me
[1:40:49] he's in me praise be to god
[1:40:55] aren't you glad to have him in you folks
[1:40:58] and let me just say this again i've said
[1:40:59] it before the best thing you got in this
[1:41:02] world
[1:41:03] is christ the holy spirit in your heart
[1:41:06] that's the thing you got
[1:41:08] the very best thing we have is for
[1:41:10] christ to be in you
[1:41:13] if you have that revelation you are a
[1:41:16] blessed person
[1:41:19] because jesus said a lot of them have
[1:41:20] ears but still there's a barrier there
[1:41:23] they still don't hear a lot of my eyes
[1:41:26] but they still don't see how many times
[1:41:30] i was just reading yesterday before
[1:41:32] brother ram says you know the very same
[1:41:34] jesus that did the very same signs
[1:41:36] when he walked the shores of galilee
[1:41:38] he's here dude not a different sign not
[1:41:40] a different work
[1:41:40] but the exact same thing we have christ
[1:41:44] with us again today and in the service
[1:41:46] you do it let me tell you something
[1:41:47] there's nothing greater than that
[1:41:49] to have evidence of like god that way in
[1:41:52] the congregation and
[1:41:53] in every service because that couldn't
[1:41:55] just be said anywhere anywhere am i
[1:41:57] right
[1:41:57] god did that through malachi 4.
[1:42:04] it could be something isn't it going to
[1:42:06] be something
[1:42:07] when the judgment stands and this
[1:42:09] generation says well i didn't see no god
[1:42:11] i didn't do this out of the other
[1:42:13] there'll be a lot of preachers burning
[1:42:16] hell because they didn't tell their
[1:42:17] congregation what god did
[1:42:20] huh but god did in this generation
[1:42:22] because i guarantee you this god's gonna
[1:42:24] say no i send you a prophet
[1:42:26] i've indicated myself more than what i
[1:42:28] ever thought of doing while i was on
[1:42:30] here on the earth
[1:42:31] seven times around the world ten times
[1:42:33] more the day of pentecost
[1:42:36] that was your message that's what god
[1:42:38] will tell this generation
[1:42:43] thank god for lifting the veil amen
[1:42:48] praise the lord i think that clock is
[1:42:50] either stopped or something
[1:42:52] so i don't have my phone so we're just
[1:42:54] going to go until i'm done
[1:43:01] here comes quarter after one right amen
[1:43:05] praise god you love him this morning all
[1:43:08] right praise be to god
[1:43:11] so we look at that look at uh how he
[1:43:14] said
[1:43:14] if veil was over their eyes how many
[1:43:17] knows the gentiles now
[1:43:20] have a veil over their eyes but a brand
[1:43:22] preached on the unveiling of god
[1:43:29] this is really
[1:43:33] the new the mystery of christ is christ
[1:43:36] in you the hope of glory
[1:43:40] the unveiling of christ in every
[1:43:41] generation at every turn
[1:43:44] has been god working in his people
[1:43:48] every one of you that claims and know
[1:43:50] not just claims or no's
[1:43:52] let me put it this way every one of you
[1:43:54] that's filled with the holy ghost
[1:43:55] dedicated your life to god
[1:43:56] you are a christian remember this you
[1:43:59] are
[1:44:00] christ to your neighborhood
[1:44:03] you are the unveiling of god to your
[1:44:06] community
[1:44:12] let that sink in
[1:44:16] how many would say oh me oh me lord help
[1:44:19] me
[1:44:20] oh me help me lord to be a good
[1:44:24] reflection of you
[1:44:26] so that people could see beyond this
[1:44:28] veil
[1:44:30] verbum says it's always the veil that
[1:44:32] hides it
[1:44:33] it's because of the veil the people
[1:44:35] don't see it
[1:44:36] well now y'all from down i understand
[1:44:39] y'all come back and see us
[1:44:41] you know y'all come back now
[1:44:48] joe is nice out there show what are we
[1:44:51] doing
[1:44:54] kentucky hillbilly language and some of
[1:44:58] the phds just couldn't see behind that
[1:45:00] veil
[1:45:01] the god was hid behind that rail he was
[1:45:04] hid behind the simplicity of a
[1:45:06] kentucky hillbilly
[1:45:10] oh god you are awesome you said you hide
[1:45:14] it from the wise and the fruit you said
[1:45:16] you
[1:45:16] you used the low people to you know
[1:45:20] to rebuke the heart you scored in this
[1:45:22] last generation
[1:45:24] you picked out a kentucky hillbilly all
[1:45:26] of his hints and coats and fetches and
[1:45:28] carries
[1:45:30] huh
[1:45:33] what did he call it some kind of a
[1:45:36] feather bed or a straw
[1:45:38] mat a straw tick
[1:45:43] i didn't even know what a straw tick
[1:45:44] wasn't that a lot got begin to thinking
[1:45:46] about a straw tick
[1:45:48] all right i believe that's something
[1:45:50] like what we had we have
[1:45:51] take two sheets and just sew it all up
[1:45:54] except one corner and stuff a bunch of
[1:45:56] straw up in there
[1:45:57] and it's fat as a tick there's your bed
[1:46:03] i guess that's right
[1:46:06] all of that over in california over in
[1:46:09] hollywood
[1:46:10] speaking that language but yet god would
[1:46:12] come down
[1:46:13] god was veiled in flesh in this
[1:46:16] generation he is still
[1:46:17] veiled in flesh am i right
[1:46:21] and i'm so thankful for that aren't you
[1:46:23] glad
[1:46:24] praise be to god
[1:46:29] lord help us i'm going to touch on this
[1:46:31] perhaps
[1:46:32] in closing
[1:46:39] two two thoughts i want to just touch on
[1:46:42] doubt
[1:46:44] doubt the barrier
[1:46:48] of doubt which is what
[1:46:51] sin the barrier of sin
[1:46:55] what would happen if you would get past
[1:46:57] to bear your sin
[1:47:00] what might be possible somebody tell me
[1:47:01] preach for me
[1:47:03] what might be possible if you get past
[1:47:06] the barrier of
[1:47:07] unbelief
[1:47:13] very good all things
[1:47:16] are possible for them to believe
[1:47:20] with you nothing shall be
[1:47:24] impossible if you can have faith
[1:47:27] if you'll get past the doubt if you need
[1:47:30] healing
[1:47:32] oh hallelujah you need the holy ghost
[1:47:36] you need to join your life this morning
[1:47:42] right now right here
[1:47:45] get past that barrier
[1:47:49] and you'll go out those doors with joy
[1:47:51] unspeakable
[1:47:53] and full of glory you'll have peace that
[1:47:56] passes understanding
[1:47:59] everybody go like this we're all just
[1:48:02] there you go praise the lord
[1:48:04] i don't like you just hunkered down like
[1:48:06] i heard that before
[1:48:08] it's going to take more than that if
[1:48:09] we're going to really break this barrier
[1:48:11] wave your hand do something but snap out
[1:48:13] of it and let's believe with all of our
[1:48:15] hearts
[1:48:16] all things are possible god is gonna
[1:48:18] take you he's gonna take me
[1:48:20] through this wicked all this horrible
[1:48:23] sodom
[1:48:23] condition and he's gonna have his pure
[1:48:26] and spotless
[1:48:27] that's what i believe i mean one of
[1:48:30] these things we're gonna break
[1:48:32] a barrier unlike you have ever seen
[1:48:36] that's why we're gonna be walking
[1:48:37] brother troy and all of a sudden a sharp
[1:48:40] feeling will come over us
[1:48:41] and we'll have our glorified body
[1:48:46] amen so we understand the prophet is
[1:48:48] when you die you go and you get a
[1:48:50] theophany body
[1:48:51] the thought theophany body comes back
[1:48:53] and picks up that dead body that they
[1:48:55] buried
[1:48:55] only that dead body that's buried it's
[1:48:58] not going to be like a
[1:49:00] dirt that has to be pushed back up
[1:49:02] because we can go through doors walls
[1:49:04] whatever you want without moving it
[1:49:06] huh amen every atom every molecule it'll
[1:49:10] be changed
[1:49:11] and if you're alive and remain you're
[1:49:13] just gonna disappear
[1:49:16] are you with me we're gonna break that
[1:49:18] barrier one of these days how many is
[1:49:20] looking for that
[1:49:22] amen it better happen before another 15
[1:49:24] years i'll probably have to go by the
[1:49:26] way to the grave
[1:49:30] but either way as long as i have that
[1:49:32] quickness power in me
[1:49:34] it's all right how many knows you don't
[1:49:36] have to fear this chaos you don't have
[1:49:37] to fear things
[1:49:38] being worse they are but let me tell you
[1:49:41] you don't have to fear that you can
[1:49:43] bust past the barrier of fear
[1:49:47] because you've got hope you know where
[1:49:48] your future is you know
[1:49:50] who you love and who is with you
[1:49:53] who leads you who guides you amen
[1:49:58] let's do this one more thing in closing
[1:50:00] and that is the barrier
[1:50:02] of indifference how many knows we're all
[1:50:04] different
[1:50:06] and sometimes we don't like certain
[1:50:08] people
[1:50:10] huh i'm going to look up there because
[1:50:12] if i look at you you're thinking
[1:50:14] i've been singing i'm talking about you
[1:50:18] but isn't it the truth we're different
[1:50:21] we have personalities
[1:50:23] some of them are like me loud and
[1:50:25] voiceless
[1:50:26] like peter and then there's john
[1:50:30] love one another children love one
[1:50:33] another
[1:50:36] you gotta love one another you know
[1:50:41] folks i don't care you know some of us
[1:50:45] amen brother others
[1:50:50] huh there's people sometimes
[1:50:54] we just you have to be careful even with
[1:50:56] your holy ghost
[1:50:57] that doesn't get a hold of you well that
[1:51:00] was just so much different for me
[1:51:02] i don't know if i really like it
[1:51:06] huh that's how we are in our carnal
[1:51:09] nature in it
[1:51:10] we don't like each other perhaps because
[1:51:11] we're so different
[1:51:14] right how many does that cause all the
[1:51:16] pentecostals become one the student of
[1:51:18] three minutes
[1:51:19] brother bam says one's riding one camel
[1:51:21] hump the other one's a cantaloupe
[1:51:22] a two-camel hump and if you ain't on the
[1:51:24] two camel hump
[1:51:25] well you just ain't going
[1:51:31] sweet camel hop i mean a three-hump
[1:51:32] camel all right let me get my story
[1:51:34] straight
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:37] that's right oneness twoness trinity
[1:51:40] or whatever it might be right maybe not
[1:51:43] see eye-to-eye
[1:51:46] you know i've disagreed with people
[1:51:47] before
[1:51:49] people have disagreed with me before but
[1:51:51] you can always sense their spirit
[1:51:53] whether they love you or whether they
[1:51:54] got the right spirit or not
[1:51:57] now if you disagree with people and they
[1:51:59] got the wrong attitude you can sense
[1:52:00] that
[1:52:02] and even if they were right you'd still
[1:52:04] know they're wrong
[1:52:06] because they can't shake your hand they
[1:52:07] don't really like you
[1:52:10] can i just say what comes to mind a
[1:52:12] quote comes back brother bam says
[1:52:13] something but it is a very horrible
[1:52:15] thing
[1:52:16] just to dislike somebody just to dislike
[1:52:20] them
[1:52:20] i don't like them that's not good
[1:52:24] you should love people it don't matter
[1:52:26] if they smack you
[1:52:27] it don't matter what happens or how they
[1:52:30] treat you you should still love those
[1:52:31] folks
[1:52:33] because when that dislike comes in there
[1:52:35] can we know that that's
[1:52:37] that's a hatred well i don't like that
[1:52:40] person
[1:52:41] might as well say i hate that person you
[1:52:44] don't like him
[1:52:46] amen
[1:52:49] i don't know how brother branham could
[1:52:52] last sunday talked about hothead you
[1:52:54] don't want people to be lost brother bam
[1:52:55] says he wouldn't wish
[1:52:56] hitler to have to go to hell
[1:53:00] huh and after what he did boy i've had
[1:53:02] all kinds of imaginations what i thought
[1:53:04] the man ought to have
[1:53:08] destroyed families by millions
[1:53:12] it was horrible
[1:53:17] that's all which and he has a little
[1:53:20] chance of being there but you don't wish
[1:53:21] them a curse
[1:53:23] you don't wish anything like that on
[1:53:25] anybody
[1:53:27] so let's realize brothers and sisters
[1:53:29] evening night tabernacle let's realize
[1:53:31] we're all different
[1:53:32] huh don't try
[1:53:36] to make that family like your family
[1:53:41] don't make that person like you ought to
[1:53:42] be like me
[1:53:45] can i go a little further because us
[1:53:48] human beings
[1:53:49] we are very prone to think that in our
[1:53:52] little group and our little thing
[1:53:54] hey this is the right way and everybody
[1:53:56] else is wrong
[1:53:59] i was listening to question answers and
[1:54:01] and i hadn't heard that brother band
[1:54:03] speak brother brad speaking like that
[1:54:04] but
[1:54:05] he talked about question answers 64 to
[1:54:07] believe it was he has about four
[1:54:08] different ones and i was listening to it
[1:54:09] last night
[1:54:10] and when he was talking about how that
[1:54:11] the bride is elected but there's still
[1:54:13] the other church that goes through the
[1:54:14] tribulation for purification and so
[1:54:16] forth
[1:54:18] amen then there's a there's a foolish
[1:54:20] virgin assistant there's different ones
[1:54:22] same god is the judge isn't that right
[1:54:24] i just want to be in the elected i'm
[1:54:26] just say god i want to be in the rapture
[1:54:28] i want to be by your side if that be
[1:54:30] your perfect will amen
[1:54:34] but what i'm trying to say is this i
[1:54:36] don't care if it's mennonite i don't
[1:54:37] care if it's homies i don't
[1:54:39] everybody thinks that this is it right
[1:54:42] and didn't the disciples do the same
[1:54:44] thing when they were walking with jesus
[1:54:47] and there was another man somewhere
[1:54:48] casting out devils and doing stuff and
[1:54:50] he says
[1:54:51] hey what about him stop him
[1:54:54] he ain't supposed to be doing that and
[1:54:56] jesus said nobody can talk likely of me
[1:54:59] and god back him up let him alone god's
[1:55:04] using him
[1:55:05] amen praise be to god
[1:55:09] amen as far as belonging to
[1:55:10] denominational system bill abraham says
[1:55:13] that the bride of jesus christ the
[1:55:14] elected of jesus christ
[1:55:16] you cannot be a member you can't belong
[1:55:18] to the denominational harlot system
[1:55:21] and be the bride of jesus christ at the
[1:55:22] same time amen
[1:55:24] to the different category why
[1:55:28] no more brother glenn then if i come up
[1:55:30] here and i begin to say end well now
[1:55:32] look
[1:55:33] god don't look at you sister so if you
[1:55:34] want to trim your hair a little bit
[1:55:35] that'd be all right
[1:55:37] but bam said one place if you want to
[1:55:38] have a little color if you want to have
[1:55:39] a little called that bi
[1:55:43] huh color your hair yeah he made that
[1:55:46] statement
[1:55:48] but let me tell you something if i come
[1:55:49] up and i push that
[1:55:51] it ain't no time before it gets away
[1:55:53] carried away
[1:55:55] i don't push i say get it as far away
[1:55:57] from the edge of that cliff as you
[1:55:59] possibly can
[1:56:00] you cut your hair your wife or your
[1:56:02] husband has a right to divorce you and
[1:56:04] put you away
[1:56:07] amen
[1:56:12] brother branham i think even even
[1:56:14] brother brown i love the way bill graham
[1:56:15] stayed with the word
[1:56:17] because there was a woman once one plate
[1:56:19] said she was a hair
[1:56:20] salonist and women wanted to have to cut
[1:56:22] their hair and she asked how
[1:56:24] can i should i cut the hair or should i
[1:56:27] he said can't tell you
[1:56:30] i don't have the word of the lord on it
[1:56:31] it just says for you not to cut your
[1:56:32] hair
[1:56:34] i want to stay with the blueprint until
[1:56:37] he give her personal advice
[1:56:39] i can give you my opinion i like that
[1:56:43] but stay with the word of god but bam
[1:56:46] says so if jezebel was the only one that
[1:56:48] ever painted her face
[1:56:49] god fed her to the dogs so if you paint
[1:56:52] your face up like jezebel remember your
[1:56:54] dog meat
[1:56:56] folks this is not on the script so i
[1:56:58] don't know who needed that
[1:57:01] i would rather be as plain jane
[1:57:04] i would rather have my hair slicked back
[1:57:06] and look like a peel onion
[1:57:10] and have the holy ghost than to be a
[1:57:13] beauty queen
[1:57:14] and be used by the devil
[1:57:17] well anyway i should say a handsome dude
[1:57:20] i guess for me but
[1:57:22] you don't want to be no beautiful
[1:57:27] you love the lord is it not good in
[1:57:30] these
[1:57:31] perilous times that you can have joy in
[1:57:34] your heart
[1:57:35] to know without a doubt that you're
[1:57:37] following a path
[1:57:39] that god came and proved and vindicated
[1:57:42] and that your heart is right with god
[1:57:44] this morning
[1:57:47] one of the first things i want to come
[1:57:48] out to say this morning that just comes
[1:57:49] out of mind i'll do it in closing
[1:57:53] but i feel like i just want to thank you
[1:57:56] lord
[1:57:58] all i wanna do is love him
[1:58:02] so glad i feel his love for me every day
[1:58:05] my heart will praise him
[1:58:07] when i think about where god has brought
[1:58:09] not just me
[1:58:12] but you are you listening where god has
[1:58:16] brought this church
[1:58:18] this god has brought this church through
[1:58:20] the biggest bunch of briar patches
[1:58:23] through the hardest things
[1:58:26] that's right i want to tell you
[1:58:29] something
[1:58:30] that says the spirit the devil tried his
[1:58:34] absolute
[1:58:34] best to shut this place down
[1:58:39] every i'm the pastor i watch over the
[1:58:42] shepherd and i over the sheep i know
[1:58:43] what's going on
[1:58:44] and i know that he almost pulled out
[1:58:47] every trick
[1:58:48] in this pouch to try to do it
[1:58:56] and folks it sure wasn't me
[1:58:59] it sure wasn't us that held it together
[1:59:04] it was god
[1:59:07] it was god when i think where he's
[1:59:12] brought us through and how good he's
[1:59:14] been to us
[1:59:16] he's so good and i was that's the first
[1:59:18] thought i had lord you have been so good
[1:59:20] to us
[1:59:20] i just want to thank you lord i felt
[1:59:22] good and i thought yeah we had some bad
[1:59:24] times too
[1:59:25] but god brought us through the hard
[1:59:27] times doesn't matter whether it was bad
[1:59:29] or good whatever
[1:59:34] folks i will leave this place tomorrow i
[1:59:36] will resign tomorrow
[1:59:39] and go somewhere where i can believe
[1:59:41] that that church is of god
[1:59:46] amen believes it
[1:59:49] no i'm not resigning don't interpret
[1:59:51] that
[1:59:53] i love what god has called me to do i
[1:59:55] appreciate it i appreciate y'all
[1:59:57] i thought about the other day he said
[1:59:58] you brother brother you need to tell
[1:59:59] everybody
[2:00:00] that you that you appreciate them not
[2:00:02] with you
[2:00:04] that's right because i got my faults
[2:00:07] folks
[2:00:07] far from perfect but
[2:00:12] anyway i believe god has a purpose in it
[2:00:17] all
[2:00:18] you know sometimes i wonder do you ever
[2:00:19] wonder why god made you the way he made
[2:00:21] you
[2:00:22] brother brad you're a different man all
[2:00:24] of us are different
[2:00:26] that's okay you know but
[2:00:29] i know that even the prophet of god said
[2:00:31] that god will pick
[2:00:33] a prophet like jonah for what he's doing
[2:00:39] i tempered and wanted god to go ahead
[2:00:40] and kill them all and destroy them i did
[2:00:42] my job not do your destroying
[2:00:44] god says boy you have to right out of
[2:00:46] the wrong attitude somebody who didn't
[2:00:48] want the job ran and had to go
[2:00:49] get swallowed by uh whatever but whether
[2:00:54] it was elijah whether it was moses
[2:00:56] whatever whatever it was
[2:00:57] always has his man so sometimes i wonder
[2:01:00] who i am
[2:01:01] i am then another way another way says
[2:01:03] well i there must be a reason for it
[2:01:08] brother bobby you are so hard-headed the
[2:01:10] boys will tell you
[2:01:11] dad i told you three times to do it this
[2:01:13] way and you still don't do it that way
[2:01:15] i'm sorry son i'll try again hard-headed
[2:01:18] i don't
[2:01:19] hit it but maybe there's a purpose in it
[2:01:22] i just hope that god doesn't let me be
[2:01:24] hard-headed to his will
[2:01:26] and it's perfect well amen that's why i
[2:01:28] want to be the spirit moves
[2:01:31] spirit moves just move it with him amen
[2:01:35] praise be to god
[2:01:37] you love him and i don't know why i said
[2:01:39] those things but i do know that
[2:01:42] this life is real folks
[2:01:45] the goodness of god to you is real
[2:01:49] we need to appreciate his goodness
[2:01:53] because guess what that's what you're
[2:01:55] going to hang on to from here on out
[2:01:57] the things of this world is going to get
[2:01:59] worse the world's going to get worse
[2:02:02] and i believe it'll go into complete
[2:02:05] calamity
[2:02:06] how many believe that the world is going
[2:02:08] to completely
[2:02:09] lose it not just america
[2:02:13] i'm talking about the world
[2:02:16] because england and those places they
[2:02:18] allowed homosexuality long before we
[2:02:19] ever thought about doing it
[2:02:21] they had all of that mess long before we
[2:02:23] did because john wesley and those take
[2:02:25] to gospel they turned them down and then
[2:02:27] guess what they went into chaos
[2:02:29] we're experiencing the going into chaos
[2:02:32] because of rejecting the prophet of god
[2:02:34] and our generation
[2:02:36] but it's world wide
[2:02:41] so can i say this this morning as your
[2:02:43] pastor
[2:02:44] dig your roots down deep not based on
[2:02:48] anything else but your relationship with
[2:02:50] god
[2:02:51] your prayer life every day amen
[2:02:56] your walk is so important
[2:02:59] open the eyes of my heart lord to see
[2:03:03] where i'm wrong where i need to get
[2:03:06] ready
[2:03:07] how many believe you've got a spot
[2:03:08] somewhere in your life that still needs
[2:03:10] to get a little more ready for the
[2:03:11] rapture
[2:03:13] amen i know i do let's stand this
[2:03:15] morning
[2:03:16] we'll stop
[2:03:20] musicians if you'll come
[2:03:33] and this just comes to mind is it okay
[2:03:36] even as satan in our past has tried to
[2:03:38] destroy us
[2:03:40] how many knows he's not going to let up
[2:03:44] he may not be as
[2:03:47] raging as he was but every individual in
[2:03:50] here everybody in here remember this
[2:03:53] if you're walking the path you're
[2:03:54] supposed to walk that doesn't
[2:03:56] like it he's not going to leave you
[2:03:58] alone
[2:04:00] if you've got a good marriage the devil
[2:04:02] will do his best to destroy
[2:04:04] you got a good home the devil will do
[2:04:06] his best to destroy
[2:04:08] you got a good church the devil will do
[2:04:10] his best to bring barricades
[2:04:12] divisions paul said let there be no
[2:04:14] divisions
[2:04:15] among you everybody have the same mind
[2:04:19] be one amen
[2:04:22] let's bow our heads
[2:04:26] i wonder before i pray how many want to
[2:04:30] move just a little closer to the lord
[2:04:32] say lord i just want to move a little
[2:04:34] closer to you lord
[2:04:35] just a little closer and i want to thank
[2:04:38] you first of all
[2:04:39] not just asking everything but i want to
[2:04:41] thank you lord
[2:04:43] for how good that you have been to us
[2:04:45] lord
[2:04:46] for always leading us and guiding us and
[2:04:48] for always making a way
[2:04:51] whenever we would come up and walk
[2:04:53] against the wall whenever we come
[2:04:54] against the barricade lord
[2:04:56] you'd always help us through lord many
[2:04:58] of us
[2:04:59] we look at our lives of where we were

[2:05:27] lord
[2:05:28] that you're leading us you're guiding us
[2:05:31] through these terrible waters
[2:05:33] these troubled times that are just
[2:05:36] getting worse
[2:05:38] we thank you father and i ask god that
[2:05:40] you would just
[2:05:41] put your hedge around every individual
[2:05:44] and don't let the devil do anything but
[2:05:47] what you
[2:05:48] allow we ask god that you continue to
[2:05:51] lead to guide us
