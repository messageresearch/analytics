TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you want to open a service prayer i will read a romans 8. we read 1 through 10 and we'll read 13 together therefore is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for the sin condemned sin in the flesh for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit because the carnal mind is imma enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit christ he is none of his i'll read 13 together for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if he through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live i hope you're all having a good week you know you read that whole chapter eighth chapter of romans why do you have to have any anxiety this morning or be be fearful in anything that you do in your life if you read a chapter like that you know that god is more than able to meet all your needs provide for you do what he needs for you and all these simple ask us in return is to believe them love them and trust them i mean that's a pretty good deal if you ask me it's just pretty simple you know it's simple things if you would uh turn with meat i don't know if i've ever done anything out of this zephaniah the third chapter you know god is in the little things this morning brothers and sisters he cares about every individual here this morning young or old big or small he doesn't care who you are you know he cares about the little things you do in life and the big things he's there with you you know sometimes it's hard for us to trust him fully trust him just to you know just to yield to what he wants us in our to do i was reading this chapter this morning and i was just thinking it kind of you know it speaks to the jewish nation i know i say this a lot but you know we're no different you know brother branham taught about the 13th chapter of revelations about the you know the power of the beast and everything in that chapter well our country's in the same place that the israeli nation was when before nebuchadnezzar came and overwhelmed them you know and you can see it in our lives in this country that we live in you know we all love our country but you can see what's happening week after week year after year decade after decade in 100 in a century we've gone to a pretty low place but let me uh read this but i was kind of thinking of where we're at both spiritually and i was reading a little bit out of brother green's book this morning too and he was in the middle of the book he was talking about before he passed away about all the churches out there in the country and in the world you know they they keep getting bigger you know people don't come to those churches anymore for the word of god they they come to be entertained and i and we don't want to come to church to be entertained we want to come to serve the lord and listen from the lord there's a big difference between the two but let me read this chapter here uh it's not a very long chapter and it says woe to her that is filthy and polluted and to the oppressing city and of course this is talking about jerusalem but you can just think of our nation or our world today and just apply those scriptures for today and we're no better than these people were back then you know we're no you know small or great literal doesn't make a difference but all in the eyes of god are equal and the same and she obeyed not the voice she received not the correction she trusted not in the lord she drew not near to her god you know and that goes it doesn't make a difference whether it's our country all the way down to a school board you know they that scripture applies to them too her pretenses within her are roaring lions our judges are even wolves they not not the bone until the marrow and when when you're dealing with a church or with a country or society when you don't have confidence in your leaders and confidence in your judges it puts people in a really bad place and he goes on to say her prophets are light and treacherous persons or priests have polluted the sanctuary they have done violence to the law the the just lord is in the midst thereof he will not do iniquity every morning do i think bring his judgment to life he faileth not they have no shame they continually to get worse they do things to other people do things to themselves and they don't have any conscience about it i have cut off the nations their towers are desolate i've made their streets waste none passes by their cities are destroyed so that there is no man and there is no inhabitation and you know you can apply that scripture even today you know the babylonian kingdom of nebuchadnezzar you can't even find it anymore you got to dig up hundreds and hundreds of feet of earth to find where it was one day and it's no different for us you know and it goes on to say i said surely that will fear me that will receive instruction so their dwellings should not be cut off and how so ever i punished them but they rose early and corrupted all they're just thinking they just can't help themselves they continually you know god gave us a warning he gives everybody a warning you know brother branham taught that that god always gives people a warning before judgment comes and that's where we're at everyone's got their warning and then the only thing to follow for us is judgment and he goes i punish them they rose early and corrupted all their doings therefore awake ye upon me saith the lord until the day that i rise up to pray from us to gather the nations that i might assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them my indignation even my fierce anger for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy and we don't want to be here that day we i hope no one wants to be here that day for then i will turn to the people of for them will i turn to the people a pure language that they may call upon the name of the lord and serve him with one consent from beyond the river ethiopia of my supplements even the daughters of my deserts shall bring my mine offering and in that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy dealings wherein thou has turned guests against me for i will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride and shall and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain i will i will also leave in the midst of thee i will also have it in poor people that they shall trust in the name of the lord and just read a few more of these scriptures here the remember of israel shall do iniquity a remnant of israel shall not do a nickname or speak lies neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they they shall feed and lie down and not shall make them afraid and he goes on to sing here single daughter of zion o israel be glad and rejoice with all thy heart o daughter resolution for the lord have taken away the thy judgments he hath cast out thine enemies from the king of israel even the lord is in the midst of thee and shall not and shall not see evil anymore now this chapter kind of speaks in if you turn with me to john the gospel of john the eighth chapter i don't know if it's me but it's pretty warm up here today i know i get in a hurry and sometimes i start reading you guys haven't even had a chance to catch up with me um starting at about the 34th verse of john the eighth chapter this is where john is talking to the rubric i mean jesus is talking to the religious leaders in his day and this is and i'll read the thirty verse it says answers he will be abraham's seed we're never in bondage to any man how thou says we shall be made free you know that's a pretty bold statement for them to say you know they went into captivity they came out of captivity the they've been waiting on the messiah for 400 years and the romans are all around them and they say that's pretty bold statement and jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever commits sin is the servant of sin and paul was talking about that in romans 8. you know what whoever you're servant of this morning i i can only speak for my own heart and what i do every day whatever you find yourself serving every day that's who you really are and you and only person that knows that is yourself your family maybe your father mother your brother your sister or the man that works with you you know that's whoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed i know that you are abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you and that's the same place we're at today you know i i noticed that in the world that if you don't agree with them anymore they've gone past just laughing at you anymore or disregarding you anymore they're past that they're moving into another stage where if you don't agree with them and do what they ask you to do they're willing to fight you and kill you we're moving to that point now on the face of the earth it's we're not quite there yet but it's getting to a point if you don't do what they want you to do they just don't disregard you anymore they're getting to be violent about making you do the things that they want you to do and if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed i know that you are abraham's eat but you seek to kill me because my words have no place in you they answered and said on them abraham is our father and jesus said unto them if you were abraham's children you would do the work of abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham you do the deeds of your father i'm not going to read that whole chapter this morning but i was just thinking this morning you know though i'm not going to say i probably will anyway but you know you know brother brandon paul that message the countdown and he said we and i think brother thomas talked about it the other day you we went from the wheel age all the way up to the rocket age today and the thing about a rocket it just keeps accelerating once you're out in a vacuum you can just keep accelerating and accelerate you don't have anything to keep you from going faster and that's where we're at this morning as you look at the things around you in the world it's not getting better it's getting worse and the speed that is getting worse is getting faster so it should make us as believers in our hearts want to get as they get further away it should make us want to get closer each day should be the opposite for the christian as the world keeps accelerating to its destiny to its final place that it's going it should make the christian this morning want to get closer should be the opposite reaction in us we should be wanting to go closer to the lord as they get further apart that's what it should be driving us to do this morning so like i said you know everyone you know i got to raise my hand up you know as i get older i find myself being frustrated more i guess that's part of being old you know things i used to do on the job that i could you know i could work 12 hours i would never say a thing and i just keep working for 12 hours it wouldn't think twice it'd be eight or nine o'clock at night and i wouldn't think anything about it as i get older that's not important to me anymore i get more frustrated the longer i'm working and it shouldn't be that way for a person anything you do with your relationship should it should be a newer experience each day you should desire more of that relationship as you get a little older younger don't make a difference you desire to be with the lord more each day brother david man let's stand and sing that chorus shut in with god in a secret place this morning is that

song service been a blessing to you it's good to see each and every one and it's good to see sister johnny's back this morning we always miss her smiling face and appreciate her being her her faithfulness and you know in an hour when a lot of people don't have a desire to be here sister john h does and i appreciate if i added i worked years and she was mean to me because every time i'd done something wrong she would tell me she wasn't mean to me but she told me she said you're not you're you know better than that say yes ma'am i really grown to love her and appreciate her over the years and you know and she's always been good to me and she spoiled me a lot when i worked at jmb had me cookies i always go turn the lights on every morning i think oh johnny says sister johnny has got me cookies i'd make her coffee and go get my cookies but uh we really appreciate you sister johnny we missed you while he was gone and you know we miss all of you when you're not here this morning and we've got some that's not here this morning and my heart's heavy this morning but i just pray that god will give him a greater desire to serve serve him and be in his house and you know a man told me the other day he said he's a christian he didn't have to go to church but you know i said just because if you go get in the garage you're not a car but if you're a christian you do go to church because that's where a christian has a desire to be is to be with god's people you know there's no place i'd rather be this morning than sitting right here except for in heaven to be in his presence with god's people and people i know that love and care for you and when you're down to help pick you up that's not a very good thing in the world anymore to have somebody that'll pick you up and somebody will tell you they love you they're praying for you church if somebody comes on your heart you pray for them you call them whatever god because they need that and our heavenly father knows what each and every one of us knows this morning you believe that amen let's stand this morning and sing that song as brother thomas comes he is here hallelujah he is here amen love him with all my heart this morning oh he is here [Music] he is here holy holy i will bless his name again oh he is here listen closely hear him your name he is he or you can touch him you by singing again as brother thomas comes this morning oh he is here [Music] he is here thank [Music] i will bless this name again he is here [Applause] listen closely hear him your name he is him you can't touch him amen amen amen praise the lord good morning good to see everybody this morning good to be in the house of lord good to have my brother-in-law amen his wife with us this morning amen david and amy it's just good to have them amen and i think we have a daniel burkholder is it i believe amen yeah all right all right god god bless y'all back there good to have you all all right it's a beautiful day amen but i'm looking forward to wednesday myself amen it's supposed to drop down to my kind of temperatures amen so praise the lord god is good amen so uh we just greet you all in the name of the lord and amen trust god is being good to you amen he always is isn't he god is good all the time so praise the lord all right well let's just bow our heads kind of heavenly father we come before you once again lord approaching your throne of grace lord desiring god that you'll speak to our hearts lord the things that we have need of hearing lord we ask god that you just get right down there where we live lord and just speak to our needs lord you know how to do that father you know the desires of our heart meditation the thoughts of our heart lord he knew all about us father so you know how to work on us lord so we just ask god that lord as i feel lord you've laid this message upon my heart to speak i pray god that they would find good fertile ground lord and they would bring forth a hundred fold lord we go from here a different people than what we have come lord closer to you more like you and just everything you want us to be lord bless the reading of the word now father we ask in jesus christ's name amen and amen praise the lord well this is kind of a different subject i guess i don't know that i've just went this way probably half and time or two when you preach for 30 years i'll tell you what there's hardly anything you haven't covered at least 10 times so amen but i just love the way that the lord will just give you a it's it's the same thought but a little bit different amen and it just gets yeah you don't put a period behind what you believe how many knows we don't put a period behind what you believe that's what denominations do and that's why they die because they've just believed so much and that's it god continuously reveals more so i want to read the scriptures and then i'll kind of testify of how uh the lord brought this about and what the theme of our message will be this morning and uh what it is to accomplish amen so if you will turn your bibles to let's go to second chronicles some of these words i probably won't be able to pronounce just quite right but y'all just bear with me amen this is in the book of chronicles and chapter 15 unless i believe where we want to be and we're going to jump around just a little bit we want to read the first two or actually we want to read from one through eight and then go 10 through 15. and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of obed and he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me now remember this is a prophet going to meet a king and and talking to him hear ye me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye be with him and if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake you for now for a long season israel have been without the true god and without a teaching priest and without a law without law but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god of israel and sought him he was found of them and in those days there was no peace to him that went out nor him that came in but great vexation were upon all the inhabitants of the country and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city for god did vex them with all adversity be strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for your work shall be rewarded down in verse 10 so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the 15th year of the reign of asa and they offered unto god the same time of the spoil which they had brought 700 oxen and 7 000 sheep and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death whether he's small or great whether man or woman and they swear unto the lord with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with cornets and all judah rejoiced in the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and saw him with the whole their whole desire and he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about now go to hebrews if hebrews i believe it is [Music] hebrews the 11th chapter and we want to read two verses out of there 11 and verse 5 by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without it faith it is impossible to please him and he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him may god had his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning so in the last week or so i've you know i was just kind of feeling like um i don't know just i felt like the water was just not flowing through me like i wanted it you know i just didn't feel like uh you know sometimes i don't know about you but sometimes you just feel like the lord isn't there or you don't feeling like you should want to amen and so you're just kind of you know you just it's you know because you want the water how many knows the water needs to flow because jesus said the water that i will give him will be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life and i believe every believer ought to have that water flowing amen we ought to have the spirit flowing through us amen god quickening things and making it real to me and i'm like you know i'm at a certain place you know here and in my walk with the lord and uh you know uh you you know a certain plateau so to speak and and i felt like it was just you you just want more amen how many with me there this morning you just really want more amen and i kind of asked myself lord why am i like why why am i like this why does it feel like this and what do i do uh you know to really get more of god you know so this morning's message you're going to be towered geared towards amen uh helping you getting from the place that you are and then dancing on to higher ground is that okay so i really like that song david saying higher ground we're gaining we want higher ground in that right and the other song is saying that i wanted to sing maybe at the end again but i thought about this because this is really goes along with it real well and that is uh i would not be denied amen and you know the thing that the felt like the lord told me you know the thing that i felt like he told me uh was that you know you know you just don't one of the first things that come i guess would be that you just don't get things from god if you aren't really serious about it you know if you're just going to lax the a daisy goal and if that's what your life is kind of like remember you're not going to get much from god because god don't care much for lacks a days ago he don't care for mediocre just kind of lukewarm so to speak right just that's what this age is this age is kind of lukewarm and sometimes i feel like that rubs off on us we get a little lukewarm with our relationship with god we get the word things become common to us god isn't this real to us what he is and well we just become dodie so to speak and it it's a terrible feeling right i i'm your human being right i believe as long as you're in this body you're going to need to trim your lamps once in a while how many blades we need lamp trimming amen and it begin to say that and then it says you know you need to and i remember what that what god told even uh you know whether it was joshua or even the prophet of god in this age you know he says you're gonna have to be more sincere now sincerity to me represents that something that you get perhaps a little more desperate about it right you want to get sincere hey you know i got to take this thing first i got to get down to business with this it's a talk of getting serious and god wants us to be serious and he wants us to be perseverant right amen and so i believe that and i begin to think about the scripture he says that they didn't come to god must believe that he is and that he will grant them their hearts desire on a recline or just relax and doting no he doesn't you're not going to find him that way he says and he is a rewarder of them that diligently right diligently seek him and so i said god i want to do that and then it comes to my mind and i want to read the scripture amen where to talk david talks about that he followed hard after god following heart after god amen and so notice he says diligently seek him amen so we want to talk a little while with the help of the lord about seeking god seeking more of god than what you have already [Music] praise god because i believe that every one of us i believe there is more of god to begin more of the holy ghost to be had come on folks we can't raise our hand we can't shout we can't say praise the lord we can't say amen a lot of times we don't have the joy folks we don't have a smile to offer anybody and you know what i've realized it also he kind of showed me you know that sometimes what you need to do if you want more of god is you've got to bring a sacrifice you gotta bring a sacrifice we bring your sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord amen but there's a lot of things a lot of times you're gonna have to sacrifice if you want something from god you have to bring god an offering an offering of sincerity an offering of digging deep and i even though i didn't felt like it i felt like i was just not where i want to be but i said god i am diligently seeking after you god i want more of you huh and you would be amazed brother brad just in that little prayer just that prayer that simple desire god began to pour himself out upon me and he's already given me two messages to me this morning's message and another one and he began to just let the water flow amen and the simplest little things amen amen i got a message lord willing that i want to preach on lettuce [Laughter] lettuce yeah that's right well not the fruit the vegetable i'm talking about let us let us not be wearing just a whole lot of things about what we ought to be doing and let's be up and doing amen don't be like dumb driven cattle be a hero in the strife how many believes he takes desperation if you want something for god you gotta be like oh buddy robinson that he was out there plowing his corner whatever and he wanted the holy ghost so bad he put the thing down he says god if you don't give me the baptism the holy ghost you're gonna find a pile about that's how serious god wants you to get god wants you tonight god wants a lot he loves people that are perseverant persistent people with zeal how many believes that i thought lord that's what i need i have become too slouchy i've become too lazy amen think about it you know and i thought about it and i thought you know i want more of god and my brother-in-law is up here and here is saturday and i'd sure like to go hunting saturday night we're after a 180 170 class buck and i love to hunt i'd like to go but you know i don't feel like i'm ready for sunday maybe i had to do a little sacrifice and sacrifice my heart for the lord folks let's admit it we're just not willing to sacrifice anything for more of god amen think about it our wednesday nights we don't sacrifice our wednesday night we got we're too busy working we're too busy for more of god that's why we don't get more of god we do good if we make it's on him oh oh here we go pastor leave us here huh we do good to make it on sunday morning we ought to be burning i can't wait for mother bowler to open them doors so i can come on in and worship the lord in spirit any truth and to offer god not some lame something god don't deserve some lame worship he deserves the highest of praise they can scream and holler for ball game for people oh i'll tell you what he got some noise in the old testament when the priests were preaching they got the worshipping god until they had to shut up couldn't even preach anymore come on folks i'll tell you what will happen let me tell you something we ever get to that place the place will get smokey this place will get cloudy with the presence of almighty god coming down but you've got to get more sincere you've got to seek the lord with all your heart that's what we need we need our cave experiences we need our two days in our little old cave somewhere we need to take some time and sacrifice some time somewhere and get along with our to ourselves with god help us in our prayer oh my people might say oh brother i think the church ought to have an all-night prayer meeting i'll tell you what the church will have it and when you you've had it for several times yourself huh how many please it starts here we as the individual we need to start the fire sure we need that but each individual needs it anybody else wants always everybody else to have the religion folks you get the religion you get the holy ghost you get the fire it'll get up it'll rub off it'll be like david when they kill the lion they all come up out of their cage and out of their holes and said i believe i'll kill me if you will see too it gave them courage to give them faith and they drove the enemy all the way out of camp but i tell you we could go we need revelation more than anything else huh we need fresh revelation you need fresh revelation we need fresh revelation of the word for that water to flow how many oh man you got to raise your hand men now but maybe at the old we'll say how many feel like that water's just not flowing like it should amen because i want it to flow through me i don't want it to get stopped up the devil tries to stop it up he robs you of your mourning daniel was persevering enough he was desperate enough he would not miss his morning prayer he would not miss his noon prayer he would not miss his evening prayer it didn't matter if they were going to throw him in the line said i got to have it because i got to seek my lord's face three times a day and he was a strong man isn't that right amen praise the lord those that diligently seek him have some let's have some diligence about us have some grit about you have some desperation hello how many knows brother branch he said you know people we just don't get desperate god hears a desperate soul is that right remember the woman that following him and kept following him jesus ignored him she wouldn't quit following him she kept falling hard after him i'm coming ain't nobody gonna doubt me even after jesus said it's not meat to give the children's bread to dogs call her a dog that's all right that's the truth i ain't none but a dog but i'm just here for a crumb oh how many knows jesus was he knew all things he knew how where she was and what she was and what he could do he was god jesus was making the point that this woman says you know i would not be denied it says that one place it says the kingdom of god is preached and the violent take it by force you will not be denied come to god and say look i'm gonna die right here if you don't do this for me it's all right now that's what i'm talking about but it's you're wrong you're halfway as long as you're halfway about it you're not going to get anywhere you ain't gonna become a better christian unless you get more serious about it until you begin to get desperate about it until you begin to say god i need you i need to follow you hard amen not soft praise the lord let me tell you something that's why churches are dead amen that's why preachers are dead they have to preach out of their mind they have to preach out of history and everything else because the water ain't flowing how can you get something fresh when this ain't fresh there it is amen it's got to be fresh here amen and i felt it was at the place i was just kind of in a plateau-like and i just you know i felt like it wasn't falling lord god what do i do what's wrong i love him because didn't i tell you that if you really listen god will talk to you but we just ain't hearing him but you got to listen to that still small voice and it was just a still small voice that says you gotta get more sincere and you ain't gonna get nothing as long as you're just huh halfway about it i want people that's perseverant i want you to be in desperation about it i want you to seek me i want you to oh my i want you to say that i gotta have you god i just gotta help you [Music] then you'll catch him then you'll get him then you'll catch his attention how many believes it he told joshua when he took over in the sec in the first book of joshua he was going to go take in the land and every place in your soul of your feet treads and so forth amen that have i given you but in verse 8 he says but this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but that shall meditate their end day and night come on folks how many of you know how many i agree hey it just doesn't do that for us a lot of times we don't meditate on it day and night like we should we meditate it on sunday morning and wednesday night folks if that's the only time you meditate on the word of god you're gonna be drier than a leaf that fell off a tree you gotta have every day fresh drink from the fountain i like somebody that has a fresh drink from the fountain [Music] they just feel better they close your bed they'll give you a smile they'll give you a handshake they'll give you a man they'll say a hallelujah glory we're not here to glorify me we're here to glorify jesus we're here to worship jesus when you say praise the lord that's to him when you say so be it you're saying that to jesus what did some say play to him on the loud symbols play him on the organ and the string instruments make a joyful noise into the load squeaky voice huh give him all you got follow him hard worship him hard love him hard amen hallelujah that's right not day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein and for then shall thou make thy way prosperous then shall thou have good success [Music] whatsoever he doeth shall proc prosper somebody that said the lord planted in the lord letting the holy spirit be leading god no matter what he does it shall prosper doesn't that know what we want not everything to fail get away from the lord one time and find out how much he gets away from you he will leave you sitting there miserable until you get back to where you are to be then he'll pick you back up again if you seek me i'll come to you he said come to me because you're gonna be able to be found oh aren't you glad for that folks it's like this let me tell you something do you realize the door to go to heaven was shut for too sick for 4 000 years it was shut but jesus on calvary opens the door he wants the door to get to heaven and the door to heaven is open and the angel said come on in come on in come on in because it's gonna shut one of these days we ought to be excited about getting in the door getting into christ amen well praise the lord i was gonna preach a little more civilized but i get carried away forgive me i've kind of preached hard is that all right it's for him whatever thou doest do it heartily the bible says heartedly as unto the lord not halfway not quarterly amen i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now amen i wouldn't take nothing from our walk with the lord no matter where you're at no matter what your situation is you can say lord what i do here what do i do here and he'll give you the answer [Applause] come on folks you think god's gonna be quiet and not tell you yeah he's gonna tell you he's going to help you out if any man ask for fish is he going to give him a snake no ask i like that oh my sometimes we just want to have faith huh but the bible says knock [Applause] to him that knocketh huh to him that knocketh to him shall be opened seek and you shall find ass and it will be given unto you i believe it don't you you got to do something for the lord all right let me tell you a brother a story out of 500 000 people half a million people in one service that right some of them services where he said that if jesus christ don't come and open this blind man's eyes uh first he says your god your buddha your seek your jeans all of you priests any of your god can come open this blind man's eyes i'll become your religion i'll follow your religion that's what he said it was it was elijah again on mount carmel that's what that was i say if you're god be god let him answer by fire right he was saying against if he's got opening button there it was quiet bunch of heathens hello and even brother bam says i would have never done it if i didn't see the lord jesus vision of it happening already i knew i knew where i could stood i knew i was going to do it ambitions and never fail he says if my lord jesus christ who i proclaimed raised 2 000 years ago and i'm here to tell you oh that's brother couldn't say that no matter where he was he says i tell you here i'm not saying that he was back there i'm saying the lord is here tonight doing the same things he did down when he was on the shores of galilee if that jesus amen that was resurrected who i represent will open this blind man's eyes will you follow jesus hands went up the man's eyes came open huh they had to grab brother madam and put security guards out of here we're trying to touch him they were trying to grab his clothes because those indians are all about touching being a part of have a souvenir or just that or the other huh anyway oh my no notice so he was talking here he said he was sitting out there and you think about that there's no building hold them so they're out there in the wide open race tracks and big places and i've seen women sit out there with their hair just stringing down fine dressed people just set in the rain all day long oh hallelujah just sat there and it was just pouring and thundering and lightning and storms are blowing them just leaning back and forth against one another like that sitting there wait till you come to pray for them and you know god honors faith like that he does he says next statement you've got to do something for god to honor you've got to do something for god to honor let's all say it you've got to do something god to honor when you get on your knees and you begin to say god i don't feel like i have you like i should lord i need more of you i want to take you with my whole heart remember the first scripture we read that's what they were doing they were kind of saying look we're going to seek the lord with all our heart all of our stuff anybody don't gonna die [Laughter] that was pretty rough brother if you don't go to seeking the lord i better see you on your knees i better see you see you seeking the lord or you will die that's how serious we are about our seeking the lord that's pretty serious isn't it no wonder god heard him huh but if you'll notice in that scripture it says that they were seeking him with their whole desire even the first commandment he said shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart all my mind all thy soul and all my strength you're supposed to love him with everything you got how many is guilty see i'm not where i ought to be i'm not where i ought to be they're still desires huh there's still doors down there there's still places in my life that i know i need to surrender more to god see jesus wants to come into your house and he don't want to just come in the front door he wants to get into your closet he must get into your private life he wants to get into your business he wants to get into every portion of you huh no matter what it is what do you do for pleasure is it sinful or is it holy he cares about that what do you do to pass your time what do you do when you're all by yourself come on folks oh that's where he wants to go and what is it you got to be open and say god here i am you want to seek him with your whole heart your whole mind your whole strength everything everything about you that's what it takes if you want more god this morning you're going to have to have a conference with god you have to have a talk with him how many believes a lot of us we need to talk with him say god this area of my life huh that area of my life it ain't surrendered like it ought to be it didn't feel like it ought to be other things take precedence over the lord and the word of god huh lord help us lord help me every one of us you've got to do something for god to honor you see to show him the people's got everything handed down to them so easy he said listen you don't appreciate it when it's given to you so easy isn't that right if you got to struggle a little bit if you're going to see god i don't know why he got the holy ghost god i don't know why this is but you're struggling but i got to get over it when you finally do you never want to go back there again huh praise be to god he says when you have to work for a little bit you'll appreciate you'll value it a little bit more amen praise be to god hallelujah listen he was preaching on desperations he's usually takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation and it's too bad he says that he does that way but us human beings are so thoughtfully in our mind that's why we get away from god it's because we get slopeful where nature to gets lawful to get lukewarm to get relaxed i've been a christian for 30 years now i am like i am come on folks i want to change i on higher ground i want to go to heaven don't you i want to meet jesus i want to be in his very image i wanted to work on me be careful he will he will flat work on you if you give him permission will it be pleasant no it won't be pleasant because when he works on you he gets rid of the old flesh he gets rid of that side that don't want to be a living sacrifice like paul said that you present your bodies a living sacrifice unto god holy and acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service your whole body is a sacrifice to god you sacrifice your will you sacrifice your own ideas your ways your thoughts your desires your plans your wishes sacrifice at all say god what do you want to what is your plan for me ah no i wonder this morning out here and out there in the streaming world i wonder how many of us say you know i have not done that with the whole heart like i should huh i haven't done it with the whole heart sure we do to a certain extent but you got to do it with the whole heart your whole mind the whole soul and all of your strength it all has to be surrendered to god then thou shalt have good success amen all right over in psalms 63 we'll go to psalms look at david a little bit how he felt about god who goes 63 and 20 and 41 i believe it is psalm 63 david begins to say oh god thou art and my god amen i guess david then got a revelation of all the things that you can make of god right but he says there ain't nothing else my god god you are my god and a car ain't pleasure ain't no riches ain't nothing else that i worship and praise more than i do god you are my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsts for thee folks i'm telling you right now if you don't have a real thirst for more of god you pray god give it to you because i'm telling you right now you're in pitiful shape if your search your soul don't thirst anymore it should thirst for more of god don't give me half a t-bone don't get me off of that little rib eye just a little piece i want the whole thing if you have a second servant let me have a second serving huh not just a portion not just a little but that was the whole thing i would all love god don't you i want more of god my soul first for thee my flesh longest for thee in a dry and thirsty land i look at the world they're thirsting to death [Music] they're dying of thirst how many knows we're living in a drought didn't brother babe says there would be a trout amen for the hearing of the true word of god amen if we're living in that ground go to this church go to that church find out if you really hear the real truth there's not very many out there that'll preach it the real truth not very many preachers that'll stand but not compromise for heavy tithe papers rich people or somebody in the church well now i better be careful definitely tell you something to say that i have to be careful while i say because of somebody y'all need a new pastor i would never have to well my folks if i sat in my office and thought about it sometimes i'd say well now you know that might affect that person but i don't i don't be mentioning you that i'm preaching it too now notice brother braham says if i'm preaching it personally at somebody i need another trip to the altar myself but if the holy ghost gives me something to preach and i don't care if somebody needs it don't need it or hit you right between the eyes you got to preach the word of god and you've got to say it otherwise i won't be able to go out those doors back there and say as i have thousands of times boy that was hard that was rough i didn't want to say it but i had to the holy ghost said you have to say it even like the prophet remember he said many times i've been circling i've i can put down sleep there ain't nobody's blood on my hands i've done my duty be a lot easier than to know that you've got people's souls that you have to enter over there amen you gotta better be called for it too amen all right well anyway let's go on shall we now notice drying where no water is when you get a passion like that when you get a thirst for seeking god like that how many believes you'll get somewhere you'll get somewhere like david did you'll know that he'll deliver you out of all your troubles he's your refugees your rock he's your god he's your god he's your deliverer he is my everything i will worship on the mountaintops oh brother bible you're way too noisy this morning [Music] huh don't you know the bible says that what you hear in the ear preach from the house house folks you ain't never seen me up on the roof you ain't seen me up in town on some roof said red bed all of y'all cause god's gonna burn this place you better turn to god jesus christ died for you on calvary you accept it or you accept the consequences but it said preach it on the housetops huh all right now notice power god should do something god's fire amen how many believes that god's fire is his power we all need it in our hearts all right so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary huh i mean it got smokey a lot of times in the sanctuary in the old testament a cloud would come down and just fog things up huh he was there because thy loving kindness is better than life huh living is pretty nice it's pretty nice be alive but let me tell you if you're living without christ you're empty on the inside you're miserable it's better just normal life it's better than life that loving kindness the sweetness of the holy spirit where you're driving on the road where you're going to work when you're coming home from work when you're working [Music] no matter we are just to have that sweetness of god in your heart there's nothing like it nothing it's better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name praise the lord my soul shall be satisfied with marrow and fatness amen amen over isaiah says come to me come eat drink let thy soul delight itself in fatness praise the lord and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my bed amen and meditate on thee in the night watches but i had a couple good dreams the other night about preaching about the lord and just his presence and when i woke up i said thank you lord for that dream i like to dream about the god about god and the good things i don't like all the kind i like good dreams don't you now notice in the night watches verse 7 because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee amen thy right hand uphold me amen praise the lord that's where david said my soul followeth hard after thee early will i seek thee how many believe we need to do more that we need to do more praying right seeking the lord's faith getting on our knees praying it would be great for us to take a day off just to go somewhere and pray meditate on the lord how many believes meditation is important for a believer blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law does he meditate wednesday and sunday once in a while no i think that was my problem you get your mind off some other things too long and you're like well you know i was thinking on such good things of the lord and i got distracted huh all these other things are really a distraction but he said day and night meditate and on his law does he meditate day and night another scripture says blessed is the man whose mind is stayed on thee boy we have got a vanity fair going on out there there's plenty to distract our minds off of the lord and what do we got to do we got to sacrifice how many believe we need to sacrifice some time lord help me to sacrifice some sometime for you everything we do for the lord it's a sacrifice coming to church getting ready going that's also making a sacrifice amen praise the lord psalms 40 uh two david says once again as the heart pantheth after the water brooks little branham described that as a wounded deer a wounded deer as long as it can make it to that water if the wound is too bad it can live and that deer oh my i i i've got another quarter a mile i've got to make it the hounds have snatched me i'm bleeding but i gotta make it to that water folks isn't that how we all feel sometimes i gotta have a fresh drink of water i need my soul refreshed i need his presence refreshed like a heart that panted after the water brooks so my soul panteth for thee after thee oh god just panting god i gotta have more of you mom amen i've had it all but what i need [Music] is more of you amen how many of these that's what we really need your biggest need this morning is what more of god more of him get sincere enough to pray anymore get desperate enough to pray more become perseverant enough to make yourself do it huh are you with me panther after the o god o my soul my soul thirsts for god for the living god when shall i come and pure appear before him praise be to god amen you have to get desperate you have to mean business how many bees we need to mean business more wherever you are whatever your state you got to be more sincere and you got to cry out to him cry out how many leads you got to cry out to god call upon his name seek him amen remember i believe it was barnabas wasn't it him that cried out jesus was passing by he killed jesus we couldn't hear him maybe he was a little too far off jesus what did the people around him say he's being too loud i don't know about you but i got a little ungodly and i told him to shut up i'm trying to get my healing here huh don't tell me to be quiet he's the messiah i've heard that he's ready to death i know he can heal me what are you trying to do stop me from being able to see huh and we'd be like david you think that's bad wait till tomorrow scream even louder jesus jesus jesus he was screaming that wouldn't hurt us to get down in the woods somewhere well the the only ones that hurt us was dear jesus but no we're just like well you know if jesus wants to give me more himself come on he ain't gonna get nothing that way get out there and let the neighbors tell them hear you screaming for jesus quiet amen it doesn't have to necessarily be a scream hello but down in here down here scream because this is what he hears amen way down here god i'm not i don't want to go home i don't want to eat supper it's nine o'clock already it's dark and i'm out here and i just have to have more of you i have to be delivered of this i need this and or this whatever it might be whatever it is are you with me if you want to get things from god you have to be serious about it brother man makes a statement in god's provided way he says you know i want to say something else here you know there has never been a any they have never been able to scientifically find a better way for a baby to get what it wants than for crying for it huh that's right you know you can't educate them to grunt you can't put the bell up on the side not just ring this little bell i don't want to hear no screaming and bland and stuff you know just ring the bell i'll give what you want no yeah they can't educate him to talk that quick but you know what he gets how he gets it he just takes god's provided way for it and he cries he yells he kicks he screams oh yeah oh yeah surrender probably if i learned that already them little legs just to go [Applause] don't be like the witch doctors and say well just let him lay there well huh remember brother brown says that's why you got these gangsters and everything else because you never got a mother's love pick that little thing up and put it up on that shoulder and so forth and pat a little bit um yeah come on that's the way it is with us we just cry out to god amen and say god i need more of you pray no time oh lord that feels so good lord that feels so good i feel like the water is flowing again i feel that closeness again i feel you again huh it feels good amen that's right that's the only way listen kicks and screams till he gets that's the only way no better way that's made listen he says god's provided way it's the best way there's no better way for a baby to get what he wants mr dr bosworth used to say that the baby that cries the loudest gets the best service amen that's right get the best service because cry is the loudest amen that's about the way it is that goes for god's children i can parallel that for you amen get up there and say you know chewing chewing gum hello i mean his brother bam didn't have much people much use for people coming to the altar slapping each other on this old sword and tuna in a while chewing gum yeah we're going to the altar today get back over there you ain't going to get nothing from god chewing chewing gum not being no serious you ought to come crawling up yeah that'd be good i didn't i ain't even worthy to walk up crawl up because you ain't calling to me you're calling to him that's god i'll be a fool for you i don't do whatever i got to do amen but i want it amen cry out for it but it's got to be serious chewing sugar you know you come up there and you say father i'm here tonight if you want to give me the holy ghost all right i'm here if you want to heal me well just sitting here i'm just sitting here but if you don't well i guess that's all right i guess that will just be your will he son wrote the will out in the bible this is his will all right and if you want nevertheless if you don't well it's all right you will never get nowhere that's what he says how many believes that you don't get anywhere you have to diligently how many believe that you have to want it you've got that one with all your heart you've got to be desperate about it serious about it listen i would rather live desperately every day right sincerely say god i can't go to work today until i first pray and commit today to you and have a little talk with you amen come home in the evenings look i ain't gonna go through this day without listening to a tape reading my bible huh i mean if we need to do more of it and it takes perseverance how many got it yet a lot of us would probably say look i skipped way too much that means you're not persevering enough you're not desperate enough i want to be desperate sincere perseverance every day i don't want to have to god to put me on the back in the hospital serious do you want to have to do that to you but like brother bam says most of the times that's what it takes that's what god's got to do to get people's attention how many know the israelites they would all the time god would bless and god would forgive him god would hear them he'd take him back and then then they'd get laxatical again and go back out in the sin got to let them get chewed up by the enemy and tore up and they said oh man i didn't why because they didn't stay sincere they didn't stay in that desperation because how many knows if you don't stay desperate the devil will rob you he will rob your joy he will rob your peace he will rob you of the holy ghost if you don't stay desperate before the lord if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves i thought you know that's a real good way to show god you're sincere in the old testament if you got sincere with god what would you do you'd go out there and you'd get some sackcloth i've never seen sackcloth but from the description of the word it's some cloth and clothes made out of bags some sacks maybe right sackcloth i don't know just what it is but it's got to be a humbling cloth and ashes huh humble yourself become humble realize you're nobody you're nothing god i am nothing i'm nobody humble yourself and pray seek the lord right and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways i can i stop there for just a few minutes we only got about 10 more minutes that all right let's look at those three things one of them is humble yourselves the next is pray the next is seek your face and the fourth is if there's anything you know you're doing wrong what do you got to do repent that's right turn from any ways oh well it's not evil well you just forget to pray you forget to read your bible all right that's not a good way huh anyway it takes you away from the lord then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and i will heal whatever your problem is how many believes he'll do that he will heal your land amen praise the lord listen billy branham in closing here he says usually it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation and now i believe that we're living in the days the days that we're living in should cause this church to go into complete desperation i believe since the message this morning from god i believe that we ought to throw his entire congregation into desperation remember he was that morning he was preaching on the token you have to have the token if you expect to go in the rapture and the token is not your life the token is god's life living in you that's the only thing that's going to be accepted it's his life and seeing the conditions that this world in huh it ought to put us into state desperation now i want to make a confession this morning because i want to tell you right now i believe that the more of the love of god that we have in our heart the more we're going to feel travail and be in travail for the people and the way that they're going for the sin and the way that it's going it really should bother you and it doesn't mean as much as it should because i know what it's like to to have the love of god in your heart so much that you're sensitive to all of these things your sense of the people that are stuck in churches that are dead have been dead for hundreds of years for people that you know they're stuck in there they're afraid to come out of there amen i i feel for those out there those sinners they're tattooing themselves huh how many tattoos would you have if it wasn't for the grace of god huh how crazy would you be how far would you have floated right and it doesn't matter how wicked they look they need christ as long as they haven't blasphemed the holy ghost they're a soul that needs god i do believe this one thing that in my heart i say lord help me to get desperate about how bright my light is shining lord i need to trim my lamp lord i need to trim up all the dross and the you know just the lukewarmness just trim that all up lord help me to be a light to you help me be a light to my neighbor help me to you know try to help somebody out just
