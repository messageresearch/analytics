chapter Paul and Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faith ful in Christ Jesus blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ having predestinated us into the adoption of children Byes Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasures of his will in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace having made made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in [Music] himself we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will we'll read this one together in whom ye also trusted after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believe were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise brother tro you may be seated good morning brothers and sisters oh drop something usually have a bunch of things written down and and a lot of things tried to put together uh usually when I get up here then it kind of all goes to the wayside it seems like it's kind of hard to keep track of things but uh if you'll go with me to uh 1 Samuel chapter 30 we're going to read a a story in here but um it's a story about David um they were out fighting him and his men were out fighting and they just came back to the city of Zig lag it's a story or scripture to us but uh in when iten happed to David and it wasn't a story to David it was a a very trying time for David uh it was a very hard time for David and then it was also very triumphant triumphant time for David so it's uh 1 Samuel chapter 30 and we'll just read through here we might skip a little bit of it maybe for time's sake maybe but starting in verse one and it came to pass when David and his men were come to zigg on the third day that the Mal malachit had invaded the South and zigg and smitten zigg and burn it with fire and had taken the women captive that were there therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way and David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive when David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep so very very low time and David's two wives were taken captive a h Noom and jezus and Abigail the wife of nabal the carlite and Dav distressed for the people spake of stoning him because of the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his every man for his sons and for his daughters but this is a key here but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God and David said to abathar the priest aik's son I pray thee bring me hither the epod and abathar brought hither the ephod to David and David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop shall I overtake them and he answered pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all so David got a positive positive thing from the Lord there he said go forth and take take him over so David went he and the 600 men that were with him and came to the brook bizor where those that were left behind stayed but David pursued and he and let's see he and 400 men for 200 AB Boe behind which were so faint they could not go over the brook bore and they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him bread and he he did eat and they made him drink water and they gave him a piece of cake of figs and two clusters of raisins and when he had eaten his Spirit came again to him for he had eaten no bread nor drink any water three days and three nights and David said unto him whom belong us thou and whence art thou and he said I am a young man of Egypt servant to an amalaki and my ma Master left me because three days ago I fell sick that wasn't a very good Master he left him sick with no food and no water so we made an invasion upon the south of the shites and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah and upon the south of Caleb and we burn zigg with fire David said unto him C thou bring me down to this company and he said swear unto me by God that thou will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master and I'll bring thee down to the company and when he had brought him down behold they were spread upon all the Earth eating and drinking and dancing making all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines and out of the land of Judah and David smote them from the Twilight even until the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save 400 young men which rode upon camels and fled and David recovered all that the amalekites carried away and David rescued his two wives there was nothing lacking to them neither uh small nor great neither Sons nor daughters neither spoil nor anything that they had taken to them David recovered all Lord praise the Lord amen and David took all the flocks and the herds which they drave before those other cattle and said this is David's spoil so not only did he recover everything but he actually got more than then was even his and David came to the 200 men which were so faint that they could not follow David whom they had made also to abide at the ver Bor and they went forth to meet David and to meet the people that were with him and when David came to near to the people he saluted them then answered all the wicked men men of bow of those that went with David and said b or he said because they they said because they went not with us we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered saved every man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and depart then they d you shall not do so my brethren with that which the Lord hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our hand David had a real revelation of who was the one fighting for him which was God who is the one who gave him the stuff in the first place for who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part is that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that terth by the stuff they shall part alike and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and ordinance for Israel unto this day when David came to zigg he sent of the spoil unto the Elders of Judah even to his friends saying Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord and it goes to say that he divided upon these different tribes and stuff but uh that story to me it says you know there's there's uh a lot of things in that story it's a breakdown of the hardship that David went through it's a breakdown of what David or what we do during a time of hardship we encourage oursel in the Lord we search for an answer from the Lord and then when we have an answer from the Lord we go forward uh it it also is a a story of great Triumph but what I like about it and kind of what what was gearing my thoughts towards it was don't uh don't ever give up to the enemy and don't ever give in the enemy basically don't ever give up and uh there's lots of other uh places in the scripture if I can keep my head on here and we'll look at these different just a few different ones just encouraging um scriptures but many stories in the Bible of shamgar uh how they had taken his stuff so many years but you know there was one year then he that was the that was the end of them taking his stuff he said that's that's it he can't do it no more so he fought for what he had his god-given rights were and he killed all those Philistines um let me see here we if we'll go see here if we go to Luke I might have this one talking Luke 181 where's Jesus talking about the unjust judge let me see if I can find it here Luke 181 this is Jesus and he spake a parable unto the them to this end that man ought to always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me at my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her Le by her continually coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and then if we'll go you can go with to me with me too uh if you want to it's up to you but let's see here that was uh let's see Matthew 15 I think it's 21 and this is of the cph cian woman yes 21 Jesus went then and departed unto the coast tyn Sid and and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is griev grievously vexed with a devil but he answered not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me she said but he answered and saidit is not meat to take the children spread and cast it to the dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the master's table then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour she uh uh not giving up and not giving in to what the devil may say there's many other stories of the woman think about the woman that washed jesus' feet there would have been many options in her mind I'm sure to get out and try to get away from that uh being that you know the devil probably was telling her well you're not you're not worthy to go in there those you're all the different things that might come you know the the heckling from the people and so forth but she pursued and went through through with what she had set in her heart to do which was to wash Jesus's feet um if we'll go let's see First Corinthians I think nine 1 Corinthians 9:24 Paul says talking about running a race know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that strive for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corrup corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as an uncertainty so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring into subjection lest that by any means which I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway talking about running the race and never giving up uh there's I'm going to finish here let's see I think I got a well I had a quote here so brother Bram saying this is my angel should go before me brother bam saidh says this off often where he says a winner never quits and a quitter never wins uh let's see but we not not but we not we who we who are in contact with the spiritual realm of God well I was prayed for talking about receiving your healing what you need to do when you're prayed for and so on and so on well I was prayed for and I didn't get my didn't get me healed so I guess there's nothing to it he says oh what a poor Crow bait you make for God see look no sir God wants somebody who will not give up a winner never quits and a quitter never wins you've got to stay and call it call things right before Satan tell him it's this away thus sayeth the Lord the Lord has said so and that it is written it's written no matter what he says it's written right here well brother he goes on to say a lot of times this is what the devil says and this is where we have a issues or I have issues I don't know you guys might be going sailing smooth through it but the devil always tries to put it back on ourselves well you can't well you can't well it's not for you well it happened for them but it can't happen for you because because it has not much to do with us it has to do with the word of the Lord and if we can encourage yourself in the word like David did back at zigg he went and encouraged himself in the Lord if we can go back and encourage ourself in the word because it doesn't have with we always look for these different things to touch or this or so on and so on it's really going back to the word sticking with the word and that's where we have our confidence from and that's where we can continue and say well now because of the word I can't give up in myself I could give up but because what I'm standing on is a sure Foundation I can't give up if I was standing on our own if we're standing on our own Foundation or something that we did I'd already gave up a long time ago but because we're not standing on our own Foundation or something that we've created or something that we've made up we're standing on the word of the Lord which is never changing so brother renom goes on to say and it just Contin but we uh okay let me see here he says well brother Brenham never got to touch me brother Brenham never got to touch me he said it is written brother Bren never got he he goes on to say it is written brother Brenham never done no healing God done your healing it's already did it's written whatever I ask and believe God I shall receive it it's mine my personal property and if we can just stick with that and he goes on to talk about Edison you know how people push through when said somebody said well that's not possible there's not no possible to have electricity well here today we enjoy electricity because a man named Thomas Edison sat and pushed through and push through and push through when everybody said that's not possible but he believed it was possible and here we sit this morning enjoying enjoying what he said was possible so if we just stick with the word stay on the word and basically the the moral of the story to me was just never give up always always believe God always continue if you got breath in your body keep quoting those scriptures and going back to the word of God brother Josh man let's stand on this morning and let's sing that song you are great you do Miracles so great good to see everybody this morning good to have our visitors from Indiana brother Gabe charity and from Missouri

amen praise the Lord amen we'll see what the Lord will have for us this morning Amen in St John 1 and we'll just read uh quite a few scriptures here kind of to just to get our foundation so to speak St John four did I say one St John 4 when therefore the Lord knew how that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus uh made and baptized uh more disciples and John though Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left Judea and be departed again into galile for he NE must needs go through Samaria amen praise the Lord amen what a sermon right there ain't that right God when the Lord Jesus Christ was walking on the shores of Galilee and so forth in Samaria he had needs to go a certain direction amen how many knows that Jesus was led by the spirit amen and then uh then cometh he to a city of of Samaria which is called Saar amen near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour then cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus saith unto her give me it give me to drink for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat then says the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew askest drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans and Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith unto the give me a drink I would have asked him ask of him and he would have have given thee Living Water Amen to woman saith unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from when then hast thou that Living Water art thou greater than our uh father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle I mean as when I read that I thought he could have replied uh yeah I kind of made Jacob and all of his children and the well how many knows that's right without Jesus Christ there was not anything made that was made the Bible said amen that's right he was certainly greater wasn't he and Jesus answers and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst how many can say Amen to that amen but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water amen that I thirst not neither come hither to draw and Jesus said unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman said unto answerers and said I have no husband and he says unto her thou has well said I have no husband for thou H has had five husbands and whom he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that s thou truly the woman saith un him I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus saith unto Heroman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor at Jerusalem worship the father amen how many's glad to worship God amen amen wherever you are you can worship God why because he says he got to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth how many knows it's not all just about Spirit but it's worshiping him in spirit and in truth amen if we're going to worship him we got to have something to worship him about and his word is what gives us that amen worshiping ability God is his spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him I know that the Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all these things Jesus said unto her and I you verely ever hear Jesus saying this to people amen but he says it to her I that speak unto thee am he amen amen oh my I don't know about you but H you talk about a gulp of water you talk about a drink that satisfies amen those scribes the Pharisees they call Jesus be elub called him chief of devils but this woman he was told that hey he is the Messiah no longer did she ever have to wonder whether he was again or not amen and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what see seekest thou or why talkest thou with her how many knows he was there by herself by himself with a woman of ill Fame amen but he had need to go by Samaria didn't Jesus say all that the father has given me will come and I will lose not a one amen this preacher standing up here does not have to worry about whether God is going to get all his children God is going to get his children he's going to see to it I don't care what he's got to do amen amen then the woman left her water pot went under the way into the City and says unto the men come see a man which showed me all things that I ever did is this not the Christ then they they went out of the city and came unto him amen we God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning but we're going to talk about thirst this morning is that okay let's talk about thirst amen praise the Lord hallelujah this woman was thirsty now notice how that after he uh how many believe that he actually gave her that drink he gave her that drink that satisfied amen amen and so we realize that all of humanity how many beles that all of humanity God has left in their heart a little place of void there's a thirst in all of humanity first of all amen but you know and we want to talk about it with a little with the help of the Lord a little how that lot of people try to satisfy that thirst that God put in you amen one of the first things that uh we would think about it is in the world in the world order and and and even the uh Io Io or something like this this new drug that came out you know how that it's an epidemic and how people are overdosing and so forth and just trying to get a little piece of mind because they're thirsty because we as humans know that we're more than animals people know people know in their heart that there is a God they might try to deny and covered up but they know that they're going to come to judgment how many beli everybody has to come to judgment so it creates a thirst for satisfy that to quench that to have that question answered amen praise the Lord amen let me uh before we go much further on our thought I want to read another scripture come back in Book of Revelations 22 Amen in verse uh verse 17 it says you know the and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say everybody amen say come and he let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely amen I believe that even that word will is a form of thirst amen because when uh uh uh it's something that you desire or you want you will you I want to come I want to get a drink it's a thirst it's a longing it's a passion Amen in our tables what what is you that you spread out your food and yeah basically have your food and your water and that is basically the substance of life amen is food and water and Jesus said blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled before there was a fin on a fish's back there had to be water for him to swim in and then before there was a a a a a wing on a bird there had to be air for him to fly with and me before there was a call of a elk amen that would make the woo and then before he would have there would be a cow somewhere that can understand the call of that elk is that right amen Jesus said my sheep hear my voice they know my voice and a stranger's voice they will not follow amen a real son and daughter of God Amen when they hear that true voice there's just something about that voice they just know that's right oh aren't you glad oh I'm oh my think about it all that the father has come given me will come to me and I won't lose a one of them amen fish are made to swim did you ever try to catch one with your hand did you ever try to swim after one why they leave you so far behind they'd be picking on your little toes huh ever see the oh my the fish how they can just swim through that water why they've got that why people can't see God in nature I don't know all these little sounds and all these instincts and all these instincts that God put in the animal kingdom and so forth and and the sounds of the birds and the different ones and you don't understand it and we don't understand a lot of what they're saying saying and so forth me but when a h goes wo me you don't understand what in the world they're saying but there will be one way down on the other end of the woods go back the craziest bunch of sounds of the human being but they understand but they're saying glory amen let me tell you something it's something when a child is away from God when a child of God is away from God it's like a fish out of water that right and they can't use their F but what did they do whenever you land that fish they ain't that right that's right you go to diving after him because if that bank just has a little curve in it brother Glenn just a little curve is all that little fish needs he's been given an instinct flop flop flop amen it ain't no time and he's going to be back back in the water and if he gets in the water he's gone that's the way a child of God is Man we might flop from here flop from there but let me get into the word of God and I'm telling you I know how to swim amen a child of God when you get saved you know how to worship God you know how to give him praise and honor and Glory oh there's a l and there there's a thirst in the real Believers in this D time it this end time Amen to worship God like never before to praise God like never before there has to be a thirst amen if there's if you're longing oh get this this morning if you're longing for more of God there's more of God to be had but you'll never get more begin until you begin to thir for all of him amen most people aren't thirsty for more they're happy where they are amen see folks I'm not happy until I get back to the Garden of Eden because that's where I come from that's where we fell from amen praise the Lord now let me just go a little bit down of this direction first of all if there's a water that we can drink that we'll never thirst again amen then that's what we want because there's a lot of water around huh there's a lot of water around there's a lot of preaching around there's a lot of word around hello but you want to make sure that you've got a real good fountain that is coming from amen the good part about this when you begin to drink this is how many believe that when you drink the word you become the word amen when you come by acts 238 repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of yourself sins and you shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus said when you get this water on the inside of you it'll be well of water springing up into everlasting life amen aren't you glad for that praise the Lord this is how Jesus said it in John 7 the Jews kind of strove amongst themselves where they he's where's he gonna go he says where I go you cannot come and so forth they were debating about all that amen and he says to him what manner of saying is this that you said you shall you shall seek me and shall not find me whether I am thether ye cannot come and in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried huh what you reckon Brother Brad you reckon he raise his volume a little bit many times Jesus sat and taught but here he says on the L day he said he cried amen saying if any man thirst let him come to me and drink oh aren't you glad that didn't that didn't go away with the apostles how many believe that's as true today as ever God is still calling let him that is thirst come the bride God he says come and drink of his F my that's right come and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow Rivers wait a minute yeah there's a s behind that River rivers rivers of Living Water brother BR preached a message called thirsting for life amen seeing in this hotel room and all of these women and men and drinking and drunk and half naked and whoe they thought this is life he went right out there grabbed them by the arm said this is not life it's death why because the next morning they were empty on the in the heart in the soul they were polluted the devil make you think that it's life it's not life the devil gives him a drink and makes him thinking that's life but it's not it's temporary and I got wrote down in my notes you know what we need we need all of the Believers to have a drinking [Music] problem we need folks to have a drinking problem didn't the prophet teach us that it's like a tree amen or a seed that's planted in the ground and every Apple that is ever in that apple seed amen all it needs is water amen give it some water drink some more drink some more everything that it ever will be will be pushed out because it drinks drink you got to drink more than your allotted portion drink more than you should okay well it doesn't quite sound right when I was back there thinking I said it's a drinking problem how would that be a problem amen but you know the more you drink the more you're going to get the devil a problem how many wants to be a problem to the devil that's the problem we drink he gets the problem he don't want me to stump he don't want me to shout he don't want you to be happy he don't want you to have joy but every human this thirst for Joy they thirst for peace they thirst for righteousness they search and SE seek for fulfillment and you'll only find it in the Lord Jesus [Applause] Christ amen that's right they thirst for it everybody wants Peace of Mind peace of mind we're living in a confused World folks is that right in a world that's got thousands of different religions is that right my I go to AIO and talk to my cousin and they'll have a certain name of a certain menite a certain h or that came out of that one and that one came out of that one you know and they're this brand they're that brand and this brand and that brand huh this woman no doubt but she was confused I looked up at word Saar and it was a place of confusion and so forth the meaning of was a place of confusion Jesus comes into the place of confusion people living in the are of confusion and desolate and so forth and gives them Clarity this woman had no more question and yet Christ could come and do the very same thing in our generation discern the thoughts and Tents of the heart world over never fail thousands of times and people will fail to recognize that that's the Messiah that's Jesus Christ aren't you glad that you can have peace of mind you don't have to wonder whether what you believe is the truth or not there's no doubt there is no question amen aren't you glad that I don't have to come up here and give you my idea of it I don't have to listen to your stinking idea of it because I'm here to tell you if God wouldn't have sent Malachi 4 took his own picture the form a pillar of fire when when uh Dr best was there and he was putting his finger and he was he was going to put it in the papers that you know I really reproved this Propet and I ought to be the one to drive him out of town took a bunch of pictures and that's the only one that was developed went to JJ Lacy the head of the FBI and so forth and they documented and searched it out and said the only real absolute authentic picture of a supernatural being ever taken God took it amen amen thousands of times he would do that sign of the Messiah Jesus would come on the platform and he would you know do exactly like he did when he was walking on the shores of Galilee so why so I wouldn't have to worry about my own idea we wouldn't have to in the world of confusion but the Bible calls it mystery Babylon the mother of harlots and Abominations of the Earth let me tell you when you reject Christ and his word you're an abomination in the of God God sees all those churches that reject Christ as an Abomination the pope himself endorsing same-sex marriages and everything else I have thought he was smarter than that but he is still my oh my wouldn't you hate to be a Catholic right about now knowing that your leader endorses all of that mess methodists do too A lot of them are doing it it shows that it's an Abomination denomination is an Abomination to almighty God Amen I'm kind of getting ahead of myself but let's just look at where the world is for a minute amen I sure wouldn't want the pope preaching to me I would can you imagine I oh my I'm just going to have to do this go going into a Methodist Church well good morning everybody can you imagine just a little that's all that you take I'm going folk I'm out of here and yet they do they have it huh it's an abomination in the S of almighty God Amen oh my remember this is where we're at Revelations 17:3 he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy amen we're Methodist Baptist Presbyterians Amish menite blasphemy we're Christians how many believe we're Christians amen and the woman was array in puring in her hand a cup full of the full of the Abominations and filthiness of before proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen you put your own ideas in there your own bunch of mess it's nothing but fornication against the word of God and upon her forehead was the name written mystery Babylon the great the mother hell yeah they say they're the mother church amen but what we don't realize what people don't realize that she's the mother can you imagine God calling churches prostitutes and harlots but he does why they claim to be married to Christ amen but flirt with other men's ideas amen mystery Babylon the mother harlots and the Abominations of the Earth Revelations 18 and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven but says that angel come down in the whole earth was lightened with his glory how many can say but about in his ministry Jesus Christ went over the seven times he faced Mohammad as Buddha 500,000 challenge him Jesus Christ to challenge him 30,000 raw heathens having to put clothes on their breasts and everything else women naked hello when they get the Holy Ghost they put clothes on oh my that's right so many 10 times the book of Acts the whole earth was l oh my no wonder they rejected such light we walk in the light such a beautiful walk will light walk where the doe drops of Mercy are right but they rejected that light having great power amen and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful Bird that's what it's become our denominational systems our churches has become nothing but a bunch of cages for unclean Birds cuz how many knows when you drink of this water it purifies you it cleanses you from unbelief it cleanses you from sin amen cleanse you verse four says and I heard another voice let me read the one before of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of Earth have committed fornication with her the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies but I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues how many know when a woman is pregnant with something she has a certain thirst a certain hunger for certain vitamins for that baby to be pure to that baby be right and that's the way the Bride of Jesus Christ is they want the certain vitamin certain word that God gave so that we can get out of this m we aren't going to go into the tribulation period we're not going to take the mark of the beast but we thirst hunger after righteousness not man's righteousness not your own righteousness but his righteousness amen my praise be to God otherwise if you don't become pure and unadulterated spotless the bride of Christ and take these vitamins God has provided brother Bram says he says rapturing faith lays in this message he said later he says you're not feeding on a man you're not feeding on a man you're the word of a man you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of almighty God and if you haven't fed properly to raise yourself up about these systems and so for and mean it's time you go to feeding and eating to raise yourself up high above it amen how many knows what happens when water just sits it just sits there doesn't go nowhere no flowing water you get a pond where the water's flowing in and water is going out amen you get a church I don't care if this church or what church you the water is here you hear the word of God but there's no Outreach there's nothing going out it becomes stagnant it becomes stagnant it get green moss all over it wiggle tails come in and all kinds of snakes and frogs unclean FL frogs coming in always looking back well we used to have great Services we used to have great church huh now we look forward not backwards become stagnant each and every one of us has to ask ourselves Lord is that river flowing is it river flowing from me or is it become stagnated amen we got to have the song leader come and pump try to get a little water out of you come on now everybody let's Worship the Lord somebody say Amen Somebody Pray no real believer he just does it from his heart you ain't got to be pumped you got got to be primed a real genuine believer he's full amen like the butter B talked about that spring that he went to and man it was always bubbling up and flowing free and stream and wonderful cold water and he says why are you so bubbly is it because a deer drink from you cuz I Dr from you is it because it no he said it's because there's something on the inside pushing out how many believe that the kind of joy that you and I need something that comes from the inside out but one thing we don't believe in is this be a bunch of fake bench of me put on bunch of stuff now be what you are if you're a Christian be a Christian let it flow from you amen thank you Lord Jesus thank you for that River thank you for the water Lord that you provided in our days it says in the last days you know perilous times will come so forth and also that there would be a h a drought in the land is that right be a drought not for just eating of the food and so forth but for the hearing of the word of God for having thus sayith the Lord people will go to and fro trying to find the voice of god wow and that's the truth too isn't it all these different voices that's out there you have to wonder what the world you know praise the Lord turn with me if you want to let's go to Jeremiah the first chapter Jeremiah 1 praise the lord we want to look at something that a lot of us are familiar with but it want to take it back to the scripture Jeremiah 1 I'm sorry not one again but Jeremiah 2 and verse 12 be astonished oh ye Heavens at this and be hor horribly afraid and be very desolate sayith the Lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and heed them out ssts broken ssts that can hold no water Amen brother BR explains this describes it I like it because I know what he's talking about I was raised at Amish and we would have this great big barn now our water came a little different but a regular sister they get the rain water off of the barn ain't that right we'd have cows everywhere amen it would get hot in the summertime the wind would blow and they would stomp around in all kinds of manure and that dust from all of that to get up in them on on top of the roof and everything and the rains that come down and they have some kind of a rag is that right they have some kind of rag before it goes into the SST so that it'll catch some of the bugs but it might catch some big stuff but I mean know it'll never catch the juices I'm here to tell you there's people that love to dip their Cup in there saying oh you should just love the what you drink you should be happy with it huh no not a real believer I can't imagine drinking that stuff but people would rather do that because why they can still do their own thing they can have their own way and people love that people like to have their own way that's why man I'm telling you what whatever you're thirsting for there's a church out there that'll meet your thirst you want to wear shorts bikinis you want to wear makeup and pants and all that other stuff they're out there for you that right every Church they have their own filter whatever that you know the filter is as long as you come through that filter you're fine huh but it's still filthy it gets wiggle tails in it it's stagnant just like the Believers that drink that stuff and mean they become M Spar all the days of Miracles has passed God don't do such a thing people don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost anymore bunch of unbelief amen praise the Lord they have different strainers that they use amen but how many know that God does have a filter God has a filter for every one of his children to come through and that's every word of God Amen I want to say that God's filter is a liquid filter let me think about how I was going to say this for you to ever attain to the very righteousness of God because that's what we're hunging and thirsting for ain't that right to really become righteous with almighty God Amen you got to drink blood you got to drink blood you got to eat flesh how many believe that Jesus said to them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you the devil try to satisfy you with chining church being a church member if he can't get you out there in the world and drinking all of that try to satisfy you he'll satisfy you with you know trying to appease your conscience with just joining a church huh maybe just being a message believer can I say something this morning that is you'll never quench your thirst until you drink his blood until you eat his flesh amen how many knows my listen unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life In You whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood ha eternal life amen and I will run my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my [Music] blood brother B how many would you how many would like for me to explain this to you you want me to explain it to you how about I tell you what the scripture says about it how about the scripture to explain to you would that be better that' be better all right he says he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him amen how many know you drink the spirit you drink the very spirit that was in that blood you take the word of God and you believe it you take it in you take it down into your soul he wasn't talking about literal he was talking about spiritual wasn't he that's right take his word into your heart take his Spirit into your heart that's how you drink him nothing will ever satisfy nothing will ever bring you completion until you get filled with the baptism of Jesus Christ himself till he comes in there and then you become that Fountain how many glad to be found there's a River of Life flowing out from me it makes the lame to walk the blind to see my neighbors can see it in me my brother my sister can see it in me there's joy unspeakable and full of Glory there's healing That's goes out there's joy that goes out there's power that goes out amen we have a thirst for many things amen for the righteousness of God to have that satisfaction of knowing that you have peace with God Paul said the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but it is righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost righteousness is the peace and joy in the Holy Ghost that's the kingdom of God how many's glad that God comes down when he washes you he washes you white when you drink his blood when you drink of him when you drink that water Brother Brad I called the blood of Jesus Christ I call that filter a liquid a liquid filter that right cuz when you repent when you repent and you confess your sins where does it go it drops down into the blood of Jesus Christ and it goes back to the head of the death you won't find it ever again that's why if you're a repentant sinner amen you put the put your confession in Jesus Christ amen amen and youren your whole body your whole soul is in Jesus Christ it scatters it into the sea of God's forgetfulness you'll still remember it but God will never remember it again you have come to the Judgment that I talked about earlier every man must come to the Judgment judgment begin at the house of God that's why we come into the house of God that's why some people don't like to come to the house of God because it'll judge you amen let me tell you something I didn't judge them churches I don't judge it God did through a vind even the Pentecostals that spoke in tongues and everything else dead because they denominated around if you speak in tongues and so forth that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost that was contrary to the word of God Amen and they died right there you reject Christ in any form or fashion anywhere and you're going to be dead it doesn't matter how alive you think you are amen my my my there's only life in the seed only life in the word of God anymore amen praise the Lord aren't you glad though Justified that's what it's a liquid filter none of our own ideas we have to die to all of our own ideas whatever that word says that's what we get that's what we believe I don't care what portion of it is if I'm not coming lining up with that I need to repent the preacher says that first Lord I need to repent if my life don't line up with that word of God Amen then you can have I have found his grace is all complete it's a uh supply all my need it is joy unspeakable and full full of Glory Full Of Glory Full Of Glory it is joy unspeakable and full of Glory oh the have has never yet been told amen Lord this morning how many is very glad that we have a fountain that's filled with blood there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins and sinners plunged beneath that blood lose all all their guilty [Music] stain God is coming for a church that's without spot and without wrinkle amen no man-made ideas you can be a one person denomination amen but just when you take your own way your own thought about it you leave God right there amen amen let me kind of close with this thinking about about the desire even though we're satisfied but yet we're not satisfied until we get back to our Eden condition how many's longing for that Eden condition the older I get the less I like to be old brother Brad I go for days and I'm like man where is my energy level where is my energy level I just don't have any energy I just don't have any what what is it is it sugar is it not eating right is it I don't know what just what it is and I have to look and say you're 62 years old son amen you don't have have the energy that you did at 40 or 50 whatever so brother Glenn how old are you brother Glenn 76 76 God help me not to be a gripy old man and he's not a gripy old man amen I mean how many preachers are elderly that are not old and gripy said don't ever let the devil Crown my old age with being a crabby old man or a crabby old woman huh no but praise be to God Amen amen we get to say well hey I'm doing good I'm still above ground amen but I'm telling you how many there's a longing in The Bride of Jesus Christ there's a longing to not have to get in a car to travel to not have to get 2x4s and build our houses with our bare hands in the hot and in the cold and to have the labor with our hands ain't that right but we're longing to be able to speak the word like Adam spoke the word and do you realize that even though our bodies are not redeemed our Spirits are amen our Spirits are because you see because before we could be lost God was going to make a way for us to be found isn't he amen when you're lost God makes a way for you to be found God help me oh my what you would do in the woods if you was lost you holler you scream You' climb a tree you do anything to try to get somebody's attention and that's where we are when we're lost God help me God help me and then when he does when he does come down there and he pick you in Grace How Sweet the Sound amen I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see I was sick but now I'm Healed how many message Believers can say this morning amen God ask why the daughter of my people not healed amen is there no bomb gillad is there no physician there yes we have a physician in the house amen you ought to be healed you ought to be alive you ought to be Spirit spiritually sick we shouldn't be spiritually cold and dead like brother B says one place he says going to some Churches and icicles hanging from the chandelier well you can't get people say amen for nothing you realize over there in Revelation 19 it says it's sounded like thunder because they were saying hallelujah amen praise be to God I'm just practicing I'm just exercising what I'm going to be over there how about you let's worship God like never before let's serve serve God like never before let's give God all like never before this is a climax age this is the time to give it all this is the time to cry out Mighty Angel cried out come out of her through the voice of the prophet he said come out of her my people don't you partake of that no more amen oh my thank the Lord that's why I love that song let me tell you about my Jesus he makes a way where a no way if you're a sinner this morning you want to get saved you want to give God your life let me know right after service or right now or whatever we'll fill that thing up we'll baptize cuz that's the best thing that anybody will ever do is to receive Christ to receive that water is repent of your sins don't hesitate it'll be too late one of these days God tugs your heart oh and I believe in the sovereignty of almighty God I can't never put that tug on your heart but if God puts a tug on your heart you listen to that tug and don't you hesitate it the devil will try to kill you before you get back to church next week give God your all don't be ashamed of him I'm not ashamed of this gospel I'm not ashamed of this message that Jesus Christ came Amen to give us in this hour oh my I don't know if I should say it somebody some people say well I don't mind hearing about Jesus Christ but not too much about brother brandham well let me tell you something about brother brandham he stood here and he says now Jesus Christ if he don't come I'm a false prophet and Jesus Christ for thousands of times would come and stand by his side and use his lips use his heart and his mind andern I'm never ashamed of Christ and I'm never never ashamed of his prophet of Christ what he done can you imagine in Paul's day every Everybody in the church has said what Paul said Paul wrote here and Paul said there and pause at this and Pa at that but you talk about a prophet in this hour right in front of you people can't hardly take it it's something else ain't it it all depends if you're a woman at the well or not if you're a woman at the well Jesus has a he has a need to come by Samaria he has a need to come by you and to give you his light because those Pharisees they rejected him and called him be elub but this woman had five husbands living in adultery and everything else she said that's the Messiah W he set me free the woman that washed his hair amen amen in Simon's house amen The Prostitute Mary I believe it was amen washed his washed his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair Jesus said her sins
