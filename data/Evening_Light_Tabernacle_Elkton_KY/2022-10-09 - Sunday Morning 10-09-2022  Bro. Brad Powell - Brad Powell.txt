quite a few rigorous stress I guess everything's pretty good everything's good amen so praise the Lord amen I already did a lot of tests on him and so we're very glad praise the Lord your man reason to shout when they looked for something can't find them right it's very easy to God Amen that's the way to go right there that's a good good thing to be happy about praise be to God God is good isn't he amen so I'm going to do Sunday school this morning and uh amen so if you want to turn with me I'm going to talk a little bit about the big band that'd be all right talk about the big bang you mean we're going to have our version of The Big Bang will that be all right turn if you will to Second Peter second Peter and uh verse chapter 3 how many knows that this whole thing is going to go out in a big bang amen it's going to go out in a big bang they claim that it came in with a big bang well I don't know about all that but I know it's going out in a big bang amen so chapter 3 verse 9 the Lord is not slack like something that he is concerning his promise as some men counts lackleness but it's long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night into which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise amen great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up amen how many knows all this wickedness all this evil is going to be burned it's all going to be burned up amen seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons are ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness amen notice that I want to just focus on that for a minute see that's what we're focusing on right we're focusing on the fact that it's all going to come to an end it's going to be dissolved amen and it causes us to be prepared for it amen get ready for what's coming amen because it's certainly on us looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of God if you'll notice it didn't say the Lord's coming we are looking for that but this calls it the day of God I mean those in the church age but probably God said this is man's day man has his day they do with you what you want slap you around but God's gonna have his day when he has his day it's gonna be his day amen praise the Lord his the day of the Lord wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a newer praise the Lord amen wherein dwelleth righteousness amen so now notice I'll treat one more verse and then we'll quit wherefore beloved seeing that he looked for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless how many believe that every individual is personally responsible to find yourself that way don't rely on nobody else don't expect nobody else to get you this way just expect it out of yourself amen that's right Let each individual be diligent that you may be found of him in peace now notice I want to go back up again uh nevertheless we according to it to his promise look for a new heavens and a new Earth and if you'll notice verse 10 also it says uh they wait a minute long suffering the day of the Lord will come as a thief tonight in which the heavens so there it is that's what I'm looking for in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat and I mean those heavens and earth I shall pass away Jesus said but my word shall never pass away now pass away we know that when a person passes away they die isn't that right but they don't become extinct they're not extinct they're not annihilated to pass away it's not the you know this Earth that we're living on we know that it's not going to be annihilated or extinct now it's never going to nothing because we know that this is the very Earth that God cleanses and purifies just like he did to your body amen we give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost he cleansed it and purified it and made a place for him to dwell amen and so it passes away the Earth the heavens and earth will pass away not in our late amen and so we know that it's going to pass away all the evil that is in it is going to pass away amen now I want to turn over to Revelation 20 first chapter and we want to look at it after it has passed away after the big bang after the great noise amen and see what what it looks like amen Isn't it nice to be able to have not a uh Daily Newspaper but this is this is the news of the future amen how many knows that your daily newspaper tells you what happened yesterday you know that would they always write about what happened yesterday but this not only tells you what happens yesterday it tells you what's happening today and it tells you what's going to happen tomorrow and you can Bank on it oh my yo isn't it awesome to know that there's something that's absolute sure nothing else outside of this is sure amen but this is absolute it is short amen and I'm thankful for that all right now Revelations 21 we want to look at this now notice it says yeah I remember Peter said we look for what a new heavens and a new Earth that's right made new now in Revelation 21. now we know this is of course after uh tribulation period and all that and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first heavens and the first Earth were passed away how did they pass away with a great noise now notice and there was no more sea now prophet of God told us that even the sea will blow up in this great noise because of the age and man you talk about fire you talk about burning the elements everything will melt with ferprint heat it all passed away and there was no mercy I mean those two-thirds of the earth is ocean right there won't be no shortage of places for us praise the Lord man I can't imagine you know you know it's just it causes your mind to kind of uh go into you know because you look at all these cities and look at all this skyscrapers and all this how are you going to bury all that how are we going to get rid of all that because we surely won't be heaven two-thirds amen that'll be that much more for us now notice so he says and I saw the holy city need a new Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride and adorned for her husband praise God how many knows that's what this new place that God's Gonna Be he's building a place for us and it's going to be just like a brand new wife walking up all adorned and that's something how he always adorned the woman all the men don't adorn that much the woman's under the doors and all is about her you don't get no round of love when he comes logging in uh or stand up Ovation and everybody look but for her it's a special place special thing isn't that right that's the way it is with Christ and his bride because amen we see uh uh you know that I don't even knows God has a bride God has a church God has a people amen and when this comes down it's going to be a thing of beauty and I I Can Only You Can Only Imagine all right and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he shall dwell with them now how many knows he does dwell with them us now but he's in US amen we don't see his Corporal body but how many notes will see his corporate body then we will dwell right there with him and not amongst these and not about this unbelief not amongst this homosexual and all these others yeah oh abomination that we have to live with Mom it's going to be holy and pure oh my all right let's look at look at our future here let's look at what happens here and I like it and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God I mean those don't wait till over there to make him your God he better be your God here you better be your very your God I wondered you worship the door praise the Lord let me say praise the Lord that's when we come here to work worship Him the praise of our God amen Hallelujah and God now this is what Ali really thought about when I thought about doing Sunday school this morning this is the scriptures and God there's something's going to be missing God so wipe away all tears from their eyes amen all tears there's not going to be any of those tears over there and there shall be no more death neither sorrow of course sorrow comes with tears in your eyes right you're not going to be any sadness I mean it's not gonna be pretty good days you feel pretty good today and the next day you don't feel so good ain't gonna be no moon fruity people there right let's go are you with me this morning now I've been up with all in my mood a good move are you in a good mood this morning I hope so praise the Lord how many loves the Lord oh my God oh neither sorrow nor crying and neither shall there be any more pain praise be to God you know this world is full of pain and suffering lots of pain and suffering goes on in this world a lot of weeping a lot of crying and a lot of disappointments but all that's going to be gone you're not going to be any of that there it's hard for us to imagine it but it's true amen no more pain for the former things are passed away amen aren't many glad for that all of that is going to be absent from our presence and he that sat upon this Throne said behold I like that behold I make all things new praise be to God and he said unto me right for these words our faith are true and faithful I like that now notice we counted hours the end of the whole Bible and then he said unto me it is done I mean those are going to come a time when it's all done praise the Lord so many things we go through in life that we're done this is done that's done can't go with your daddy with that and that day we'll come over there when we're over there The Voice will say it is done there was one other time I believe God said it is finished right that was on Calvary when he purchased your salvation when he purchased your healing when he purchased your joy when he purchased everything you ever had need of and he bought it and he paid for it he said it is done the work is done the suffering it's done the bleeding's done that right just before he gave up the ghost he said it's finished my work is done come another time when he says it's done that's after his people are with him that he has redeemed and purchased amen I am the first or I am Alpha and I am the Omega I am the beginning and I am the end and I will give unto him that is the thirst amen I may believe that it's such a blessing to want to go to church yeah you can be glad that you're thirsty for some life for more of God be thankful for nothing oh my it's sad that we have one empty Pew it's sad that we have an empty balcony the whole world should thirst for this but they don't do that that's why we have a smaller crowd because there's just fewer people that have a real thirst and a real hunger for God how many is hungry and thirsty I mean these God's going to feed him to feed you from his table this morning amen he's going to use our brother Brad Amen to speak to our hearts the things that we have need of so make sure you open your heart amen say God what do you want me to hear not what does my neighbor need to hear

make me whole [Music] just like the devil isn't it try to disrupt the service and tell you the flow of the Holy Spirit you can feel it from the Sunday School the reading of the word the songs that we're sang and we just want to continue to bring that out and fully surrender ourselves to God this morning and just deliver the word of God thank you musicians appreciate the music you know the songs that we're saying I was writing them down because they they set the pace for the service and and the atmosphere and behold what manner of man is this and take up your cross and um the different ones that were sung and it just goes right along with what I've been looking at this week and and thinking on and I just asked this morning how many of you has been tested this week we're in testing times and the the load is heavy and the burden is heavy the weight is heavy the stress the pressure and I just want to to bring a little message this morning I'm going to try to slow down I don't have a a big plate but I think we got good food uh so uh we're gonna Feast on what the Lord's laid on our on our heart turn to Matthew chapter 11. foreign Matthew chapter 11 this is one of the most familiar scriptures and it's probably been preached on as much as any scripture in the Bible but if we come with Open Hearts it'll be made Anew to us every day Matthew chapter 11 and verse 28. I still hear the pages turning say Amen if you're there amen come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and they didn't notice it didn't say some of you a few of you says all of you all that are that are laboring a heavy laid and I will give you rest take my yoke up on you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light let's just pray Heavenly Father we just come before you this morning with grateful hearts with a great grateful hearts that we can come and fellowship around your word and with the Believers and brothers and sisters have gathered together and they've brought their lick of fire and and we've come together to to set the building of fire so to speak Lord Jesus and or we can definitely feel your presence and Lord we ask that that presence would stay with us as I Surrender myself fully to you Lord I said all thoughts aside and just ask that you would take complete control my thoughts are just broken thoughts and and broken ideas Lord but you're solid you're true your word never fails and Lord we depend upon that open our hearts to receive see what you would have for us Lord and lead us in the way the word would have us to go we just want to tell you we love you and appreciate you and give you all honor and glory for those words that will be spoken in Jesus name amen amen you can have your seats so we look at the scripture here my yoke is easy and my burden is light and when I first looked at this you know we've like I said we've looked at this many many times uh over time and and has been preached over and over but I want you to notice when he talks about his yoke now we don't talk about Yokes and harnesses and such so more so much as we do in the times past but the difference is I want to demonstrate to you or tell you the difference between the harness and a yoke the harness is used on an individual animal so we have an animal that's going out to work and if you're using one animal you put a harness on that animal and that animal begins to work and he's doing you're dependent solely upon that animal's harness it's a pool as he works through the fields but Jesus here the word is telling us take my yoke my yoke because a yoke is used on two different animals it's no longer one person trying to do everything his self it's no longer you trying to make your way it's no longer you trying to overcome your battles but now you're yoked yourself with Jesus Christ I can't harness myself and overcome this world I can't put a harness on me and work and try to work my way through the obstacles that I face on day-to-day basis so I have to rely on this scripture and go back and say I need to be yoked with you Jesus so that I can be an overcomer so that I'm not doing this all by myself the harness versus the yoke and my title this morning is burdens into blessings think about this I want to focus on these two words if and I guess I'm gonna try to take my time burdens and blessings so as we look at burdens we look at the word burden and it means a load it means something we associate with a weight or a task or a pressure or a stress this is the words that type burdens and we're living in a burdened age and I want you to listen to what the dictionary the sentence it uses in it says the burden of establishing that the cost was unreasonable and when I read that I thought man we can sure put in there the burden of forgiveness the cost was unreasonable let that sink in for a second the burden of forgiveness the cost of that was unreasonable you and I should never have had to ask one man to carry all of our sins all of our all of our weaknesses all of our doubts all of our fears all of our sickness we should never have had to put that burden on one man that's an unreasonable cost to bear He Paid a Debt that I could never pay now let's look at the word blessings we look at the word blessings and we see God's favor God's protection God's goodness God's reward God's relief success we think about this we're all looking for blessings right how many times do we say Lord bless us Lord Lord bless this Lord bless that Lord bless my children bless bless bless we're looking for blessed sins but let me tell you be careful what you ask for because you cannot have the blessing without first bearing the burden no blessing that you'll ever receive comes without a cost there's a cost that's associated with each blessings and I've heard that burdens and blessings are first cousins they're always together you can't have one without the other in other words you really can't be blessed until you've been burdened because blessings are the reward of carrying the weight [Music] brothers and sisters we may not like it in our flesh we may not get that warm and fuzzy feeling and that just little getting us and happiness when we go through things but our flesh is not what matters we have to go through these things we have to go through the test and through the trials and through the obstacles in order for us to be successful to be successful Christians to be successful business owners to be successful church leaders [Music] you have to be able to go through these burdens I thought about this and I can remember when I first started preaching fun times not really but you were prepared and you prepare and you prepare and the people look at you with a stare on their face and I wondered it I wanted I wonder when are they ever going to respond to what I'm saying what are they going to look and really be thinking what are you saying some good stuff amen he's really preaching preach brother amen what are they going to do that when are they going to help me and then I had a wise preacher by the name of bro Daryl Ward you know I talked to him and he said Brother Brad he said I don't mean to hurt your feelings but the people are enduring you yeah you talking about busting that bubble the people are enduring you because you haven't been through things yet you haven't been through the challenges of life you can't get up there and tell how a marriage is supposed to work you ain't been married long enough you don't know what it means to see your kids suffer you don't even have kids they're just too young you don't know the burdens of life where you can portray it and give it back to the people they are enduring you that's a burden but now I've come to realize that it's our responsibility to show the world how Christ reacts in a crisis it's on our shoulders now to show the world what happens when we as Christians are challenged so let me throw some words at you and ask yourself how often you can relate to these words barrier how many has ever felt like you've had barriers throwed up in your life you've had things come up a hurdle you ever watched those people run hurdles oh they look good for about the first 100 meters and after that them legs start really really hard to get over them it's a hurdle in their life of stumbling Bach a snag a setback here's one we hear and we hate to hear a complication doctor comes out says I'm sorry the surgery didn't go as well we run into some complications what kind of Burden does that instantly hit you with complications difficulty problems disadvantaged we can all relate to these words and we can all put these and we consider these words as as blocks and things that prevent us from achieving or hinders us and our success but that's not the way God sees it when God sees these words when God hears us use these words he says I see a blessing in the making I see an opportunity for a child of mine to overcome a mountain that he couldn't go over I see an opportunity for for my child to to overcome and rise to an occasion higher than he ever has if he'll just yoke his self with me if he will lay down his burdens right yeah and leave it alone foreign I'm sorry you're going to get them anyway to the prophet he says now go es on son from the cruel testing that he's not going to spare you or I from Cruel testing [Music] I had somebody earlier well it's been some time ago they were giving me their wisdom they don't attend church but they were giving me their wisdom and they were telling me how that this young couple was planning to move and everything was going uh against them and this fell through and that fell through and they're they're moving for this reason they think it's going to help them here and help them there and they're trying to do this and do that and everything's just falling apart and he said you know what I'm not I'm not a religious person but it looks to me like if this was God's plan everything would go smooth the way you said that right you're not a religious person because that's not the way things operate if you want the blessings of a good church you're going to have to burden for that if you want the blessings of a good job you're going to have to bear the burden of that if you want the blessings on your children you're gonna have to bear the burden of that and pray and pray and pray don't let roadblocks and barriers and stumbling blocks set you back and think well that's not God's will maybe God is setting you up to overcome and show the world that he is able [Applause] [Music] here was Jesus was confronting his greatest test that he ever had Gethsemane just laid before him he said it was that once and final all-sufficient test that must come when the burdens of the entire world laid upon his blessed shoulder he said there was no one in all of heaven or earth that could that could ever stood it but him and to know that all the sins of past present and future rested upon his decision and it was one of the most greatest victories that Christ ever won proved his great messiahship and when he said to God not my will but thine be done not my will but thine be done that was the greatest victory that he had ever won all the Demons of Torment was around him to tempt him and try him in another place he's talking on the same same kind of story and yes all the demons were there to torment and to try and brother Branham said that Billy Sunday said that there was Angel setting in every tree limb all around just waiting for his call to change the situation but God cared about us too much and he plays those burdens upon him and he stood there and he took that torture and he said not my will but thine be done and we have to get into our minds and we have to say not my will but thine be done you know it's easy to come and say Lord I'm gonna lay my birds down and you lay down this problem and then you try to fix it and figure it out all week long you want the outcome to still be what you want it to be that's not thy will being done [Music] we have to get to a place that when we have burdens when we have cares and concerns and things that we have no control over we lay it down at the foot of the cross and we walk away from it and say whatever the whatever the situation whatever the circumstance however this ends God it's you he said and when we get right with God our hearts become pure the holy spirit is taking place in our hearts it's the most glorious thing the Bible tells us our testings and trials are more precious silver and gold that's that's hard that's hard to swallow and James he begins to talk about it in the book of James after when he talks about the troubles that we have in life and he says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diver's Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience so you mean to tell me that I'm supposed to consider this pure joy man y'all get quiet when life comes knocking at your door hey yes sir who are you I'm problems that's who I am I'm problems I'm fear I'm anxiety I'm pressure well they've knocked on my door I don't know if they've ever been it's yours I'm supposed to consider that Joy and I'm supposed to look at that and face my trials and know that these testings are going to develop perseverance that's when we want to throw in the towel so many times I quit things go wrong at work I'm done we're going to throw in a towel we quit your marriage hits a little bump in the road we're divorced this applies to all Christians because James there he says we should he didn't say that we should Rejoice if we have trials you can look at it later James chapter one he said you will rejoice when you have trials you know it's easy to be a Christian when things are going good but let's let the problems come knocking at the door then things get a little more sticky a little more difficult a little hairy situation there and the next thing you know you're wondering can I even praise God foreign these trials are what molds us and makes us these trials we have to learn how to get through these problems but I'm afraid sometimes many times we try to focus more on ourselves and not enough on God and we step into that pity party phase yeah woe is me pity party God just don't love me if he loved me he wouldn't do me this way and we begin to step into that phase right there instead of really instead of looking and taking the problem to the problem solver we magnify the problem we begin to brag and and just tell Satan how good this problem is and we tell everybody about it the doctor said if I don't do this and I'm gonna have this and I got so many months to live and this is the kind of cancer you can never get over and the heart disease they don't even know if they've got appeal to correct it go to the problem solver don't magnify the problem lay it at his feet [Music] I'm going to take just a minute to talk about Trevor hessen as I was thinking about this week Joyce to talk to Tina yesterday and we prayed for Trevor and we prayed for him and we've seen things happen we've seen since he was 15 he's what 21 now 20. and we look at the situation and I look at it Through The Eyes of a nurse and I hear he's got tubes in both lungs a tube down his throat tubes drains coming out of his sides and he's got sepsis I never claimed it I never said it out loud but I thought this boy will never make it you don't realize the magnitude of what he was going through I've seen this in hospitals I've seen people get septic and be gone in a couple of hours I've seen tubes that get backed up and cause people to drown on their own breath I've seen this over and over and so I knew the magnitude of this this young man had been through over I think over a hundred surgeries under Anastasia over a hundred times and the doctors come out and say we had a little complication it was supposed to be a eight nine ten hour surgery it was 15 hours and not to mention we lost a part of his esophagus inside of him this is serious serious business and Joyce was talking to Tina and she was just elated yesterday he ate some mashed potatoes he drunk a little fluid somebody come up to him and Hobby Lobby you think where is the blessings in this bird How can there be a blessing in watching your loved when your child that she bore herself and his race from 15 years old to now go through surgery and surgery and so suffering and suffering where is the blessings God she said somebody out of the blue come walking up to her at Hobby Lobby and she started crying I said I want you to know we've been praying for you and your faith is stronger than any faith I've ever seen and anybody in my life there's your blessings she said it she said it's almost like we're celebrities and she didn't mean that in a in a boisterous way but she said people we don't even know come up and they are inspired by our level of faith and our desire to hold on and to believe that through this greatest obstacle my son is going to walk out of this hospital and he's going to eat and drink again God has heard her cries she laid her burden down she said I could never have done this on my own she said it was too much for me to bear I had to take it to God she goes up to Mayo Clinic things go disarray he can't breathe he's choking she runs two three blocks to get to him she's by herself I think God somebody had laid it on their heart to send some people up the ethics my sister-in-law Sarah and her mom went but she was bearing this all alone how good is God when you think about this overcoming obstacle and for her to come through it and say and admit there's no way I could do this by myself it was only God that's what you call taking your problem to the problem solver some people believe that if you have problems in life it's because you don't have enough Faith or you're not living right they say you know you you get stronger Faith you get less problems you'll have and the closer you get to Christ the less you'll have to overcome it didn't work that way for me the closer I got the harder it got the more faith I had the more more times I had to put into action Paul says we're all given a Measure of Faith not that this person's as greater or that it puts us all on an equal playing field each person has a Measure of Faith the challenge comes for us as Believers when we take that Measure of Faith hey what do we do with it and it gets stronger and stronger and stronger or do we just kind of let it go back to the to the Wayside there and just kind of let it dwindle away and watch it just wither away it's what you do with your faith how do you build that Faith it's when you come through challenges and you come up to that roadblock you come up to that challenge it's how you handle it do you say I'm not going to worry about this I'm going to give it to God or you say I'll never overcome this there's no need in trying you see the difference it's all in the verbiage of one sentence it's how you approach the problem nobody had greater Faith than those people that received the Holy Spirit on the Pentecost but if you look back at the lives of them they suffered Untold persecutions you look at Paul you look at the problems that Paul had it wasn't because he didn't have faith it wasn't because he was not a Believer but God used these trials in Paul's life to mold him and to be in a willing believer and be a stronger believer so that he could take the message of his hour to the gentile people that they could see Christ as a savior laughs many times though we see people that they want the blessings but they're not willing to Bear the burdens they're not willing to go the extra mile they want the success they want the fame they want the riches they want the notoriety they want everything but they don't want to quite work to get there and it's not just in a spiritual you know I thought a great type here was when I uh I'm thinking about some of these pro athletes in the natural side everybody wants what they got you take Tom Brady anybody ever heard of him okay I'm just making sure Tom Brady's been to 10 Super Bowls he's got seven championship rings five Super Bowl MVP titles it's worth over 250 million dollars makes 30 million dollars a year has over 245 regular season wins 35 postseason wins for more than 280 season wins more than any quarterback in history but you know what I watched his documentary and you know what one of his teammates said about him he said he's the most hated quarterback in history you know why he's the most hated quarterback in history this man said us linemen out there in full paths and at a hundred and something degrees and we're out there practicing for six hours and he's over there with no pads on just making passes making passes and then when practice is over Coach calls practice he says come on boys we're going to run plays for another two hours his work ethics are unheard of his High School coaches his car the college the college coaches I think it was that was mentioning to talk about it said his dedication and his work ethics are unheard of he's willing to put in the time and the effort and he's willing to Bear the burden that it took to be the best that there ever was it's the same thing in our Christian walk are we willing to Bear the burdens that it takes to say God I'm an overcomer David God I will not be defeated by Satan are we willing to put in the burden of time the prayer the effort Paul was one of the most important leaders of his day he like I said he was going to take the gospel to the Gentile church he had a purpose and a calling and he was going to go back there and he was going to take the word at a time when people were deviating away from the word they were trying to go a different direction and Paul comes around he begins to to go against the false teachers he's bearing the burden of of false teachings and he's going in there he's confounding these false teachers and Paul puts it upon himself he writes over one-third of the New Testament he'd have a MacBook Pro he didn't have office suite no he had a quill and an ink and some parchment and maybe he's chiseled on a few Stones here or there whatever he could find to make his notes and to write the New Testament you talking about a burden but Paul lived for God through all the challenges God's greatest Saints through history face big challenges Moses David Daniel God's chosen people face challenges the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to face challenges the preachers around this message are going to face challenges they're going to face burdens and I tell you what anybody that wants to preach you've lost your mind because it's a burden it's a it's a burden that's almost without God unbearable to bear because you're standing here and you're handling the word of God and you're handling the people of God the very bride of Jesus Christ his lovely bride and you're handling the word and you're trying to help in your church but you just hope and pray that you don't say one wrong thing because you don't want to discourage you don't want to diss track you don't want to knock anybody off of their path but you're trying you're with all your effort to get there and that is a burden that is so hard to bear and like I said you can't really preach till you've been through fire so life is not always easy for the preacher I've seen my wife suffer much for me I've seen my children suffer much for me brother Byler has seen his family suffer much because of him because of what God called him to be but it is a burden that we bear for God's Kingdom thank you to succeed in our Christian lives we must be able to be Overcomers Paul's facing these challenges just look in the Corinthians second Corinthians 4 6 10 and 11. read through those chapters Paul was perplexed persecuted struck down delivered for death put in prison faced rice nights without sleep hungry thirsty no clothes to wear he got cold to wear he was slandered he was sad he was lonely he was whipped as punishment by the Jews five different times he was beaten with sticks three times he was stoned and left for dead he was Shipwrecked three times he was left floundering in the ocean for 24 hours he faced robbers his friends left him oh some of the churches he founded rejected him his converts backslid and went back out into the world and we think we've got burdens but it says somehow he was over to able to overcome all of those obstacles how does how was he able to do that Paul didn't find it in his own self he never did himself and said I'm going to make it through this you look at the life of Paul and read his readings and you begin to look and he relied upon the supernatural power of God the challenges we Face will probably never be on the level of what Paul went through or those those former Heroes of the word of the faith but yet we're going to have challenges and how are we going to get through them just like Paul did relying upon the supernatural power of God Almighty Paul was so confident brothers and sisters and the power of the Holy Ghost that it says he took pleasure in the challenges listen now took pleasure in the challenges for the sake of Christ pleasure he but how how does a man take pleasure when those challenges come how does he do that because he knew that the power of God would manifest itself and every time he went through a challenge God was manifest every time trials came God was manifest Paul prayed and he said I'm anxious for nothing but in everything I'll be in prayer and supplication I'm going to let my requests be known to God Paul cast his burdens on the Lord he said cast your burdens on the Lord and He will sustain you say that's easy to say you don't get the answer you're looking for it's not that easy but Paul says you know you ever get that way sometimes you get in a trial in life and you're burden and you pray and you pray and you think you know how it's going to work out and you're getting excited and man this is all fixing to fall into place just like I wanted to and then uh not so much but Paul kept taking it finding pleasure taking it casting his cares how was he able to do that he relied on scripture and it said all things work do good it don't matter if it's the outcome you were looking for I've went through many things in my life that the outcome wasn't nowhere near what I was looking for but it worked out to the good no matter what the devil throws out at us God could turn us around to the good Jesus is not he's not uh he's not upset when demons come knocking on our door and trying to to get us to fall Jesus that doesn't intimidate Jesus it didn't intimidate Paul Paul didn't even dwell on those things the Bible says that Paul said we should fill our minds with positive thoughts from God think on the good things about God the noble things the positive things worthy things that's what Paul said he didn't say dwell down here in the gutters where things are no good and he's writing that in a prison unjustly accused Paul shows how we can overcome these challenges and brothers and sisters I want you to know we're drawing from an inexhaustible Fountain of strength I should have had some amens to hear to hear y'all right now you think I said El Cheapo a sufficient one the one who is more than enough he didn't say here's you a little bit and this will get you through he said here's your son and here's your son and here's you some because I'm the god of more than enough I've got more than you could ever spend I've got more than you could ever give away I'm the god of enough foreign we don't like these challenges you ever heard the story of the giraffe the mother giraffe her hindquarters probably standing around 12 to 14 foot tall it is another giraffe well she gets ready to give birth to a baby this is the this is the process that happens this baby begins to make its Journey Down the birth canal and this mama giraffe begins to fill this taken place she doesn't go into the jungle and try to find some soft padded bushes or somewhere she goes out into the very open out into the Prairie out into the very flat Dusty dirt and this baby comes out of the canal and it falls to the Earth 10 to 12 foot welcome to the world it's not soft it's hard it's Rocky it's sticky it's dusty it's nasty and this little baby's laying there with his legs all curled up under it and this mother will go over to this little baby giraffe that just took the tumble of his life staring over top of it and kick it as hard as she can kick it and this little giraffe is sitting there and these big long eight foot legs are thrusting into this baby giraffe and it's rolling and tumbling and rolling and tumbling and if it don't get up she goes over kicks it again if this baby doesn't stand up she'll kick it again and again and again and this baby and this will happen over and over and over until this baby finally stands up and you know what happens you got it she kicks him down again she is training she's not doing this because she's an unfit mother she's not doing this because because she's not happy because she doesn't love this baby she's doing quite the contrary she's doing it because she loves this baby because if this baby does not learn how to stand up and get on them big long spindly legs it will never outrun the line that's chasing its heels God sometimes has to let us fall flat on our face then allow somebody to kick us when we're down we don't like it let me tell you that little giraffe don't like it but he knows mama loves me and I'm going to tell you God let you fall on your face and let you get kicked and let you get bruised and let you get beaten because God loves you you know experience is the best teacher best school I ever had was a School of Hard Knocks you don't forget them I don't know who said that but praise the Lord you don't forget them those those kinds of days they begin to build up and you remember and you don't forget them because when you get through those trials you know who you had to depend on and let me tell you if you don't pass the test thank you brother you'll take it again boy God sometimes has a sense of humor on me I've told you stories where I lose my cool at referees in ball games my kids are playing they get treated unjustly of course you know it's always that way and you holler and you scream and you get mad I've had to take that test over and over and I I finally got the feeling pretty good I didn't let it get the best of me much anymore but here you have the same test different day different person God knows you can handle it we went to visit at Eastern with Western last weekend we went golfing Family Day Out fun family fun day we're going golfing man what a day what's better than being on the golf course with your family right we get on the second hole and somebody has held the whole course up so we know this is going to be a long day that's not fun go to the third hole with par three all right we all hit our balls none of us hit the green it was a pretty tough course and those who don't know golf you're not supposed to drive around the greens on par threes okay you're just you're supposed to stay on the cart path they call it so we go on the little golf carts I'm trying to speed the day up people's waiting behind us I tell Western I say my balls over there just cut across here let's let's get over here and get get out of the way we walk up I'm getting ready to hit my ball man Wesson's playing together and Joyce and Carson's playing together getting ready to hit my ball walking up and some guy yells from the top of his lungs behind me get your card out of the Fairway okay do you work here then with some four letter words back at me he let me be known he didn't work there and it didn't matter if he did or not so now I'm trying to put and my hands are done like this jealous looks at Carson said yeah Daddy's done we're only on the third hole your daddy's done what's that what are you gonna do I said I don't know well I'll tell you in my flesh I wanted to go take a seven iron and well we'll leave that to you but I went off so let's just play let's just play I hit my drive I tried to kill a car I was trying to get the frustration out you know I it went right that's just compounds for the frustration so we're driving down the Fairway I thought what am I to do what am I to do and they just dawned on me what would Jesus do well it wasn't what I was planning on doing so we finished a hole and I tell Wes and I said turn around we're going we're going to sing he turned that thing around no he he didn't know what was fixing to happen but we get up there I pull up this one guy I say was you holding at me back there wasn't me but he's like I ain't got nothing to do with this is that guy right up oh good he drove on so we went over this guy and In the Flesh it was kind of funny because this guy was looking for a ball that he lost and he wasn't nowhere knew here a cart a club a ball he couldn't throw a shoe at us if we was going after him I step out of the car at West the Spells up steps out behind me That's my boy I walk up to him I said I want to tell you something and he's looking at me and he's he's kind of got not a pretty face and he's looking at my house said first of all I'm a Christian well that set him back a little bit I said as a Christian I don't appreciate you hollering at me in front of everybody to try to fix a problem that's not really yours to fix I said second of all I don't appreciate you cussing at me and my family and my wife who are Christians he said I apologize I said have a nice day I don't want to take that test no more I'm done with that test but we will have to take tests over and over and over until you overcome it I was telling my friend Daryl about who Pastors in Hopkinsville Baptist preacher and I was telling him about it and telling him what the what the what had happened there and he said you know if he said the greatest thing about it is the blessings that come with that because when we went back up Carson and Joyce was up I didn't let them come down there so Carson he was already you know he was chomping he wouldn't know what was going on what happened what happened what happened and Weston looks at him and says it was handled appropriately that's a blessed because you know I could have gotten really mad I could have let the temper get the best of me and I could have took a seminar bear and raped his teeth out and I would have been in jail and my son would have probably been in jail but I bared swallowed my pride and just let him know hey God's people shouldn't be talked to this way have a nice day foreign we think that our burdens he said I might inject this right here we think our burns are so heavy sometimes that there's nothing like it in the world you all know those people are y'all do you know all those things are good for you they're demoed you to make you prophets and sages was molded on the backside of the desert in the hot blazing sun through tribulations Trials of persecutions and these things that we have today here's nothing happened to us that hasn't happened to other Christians sometimes we think we're secluded because we're the bride but we're Christians that things have happened he said other Christians have had to stand in the hour of Darkness like this be fed to the Lions for their testimony hmm I'm going to read or just go through a portion of scripture here I've got two more little scenarios and I'm going to try to get get through these Mark chapter six we look at Jesus and Jesus says just come down and and he's ready to move on and he's getting ready to move and by that time the multitude of people come down and they see him and they know who he is and he had so much compassion on those people the burden he had for him he said we got to stop here and we got to teach because these people are like sheep without a Shepherd they need to hear the word of God and he sits down there and he begins to uh uh look at this and the disciples are looking at him and they say Lord you know we're far spent this is a desert place and now time is far past in other words his disciples are telling him Lord there is no restaurants around here and you've preached past 12 30. the people are tired the people are weary the people are starting to fall out and I want you to look at what a burden this was we don't hear this side of the story We very rarely go tomorrow Mark we always read Matthew but listen to what Mark Mark is a good Storyteller he gives details and he says they say should we go into the country and shall we go to buy 200 penny worth of bread to give them to eat that's ten thousand dollars worth of bread today think of the burden now we're starting to put this picture into into into reality should we go take ten thousand dollars and go buy enough rolls to feed these people because they're passing out everywhere Lord and he says well how much do we have we got Five Loaves and two fishes now watch what he says go make them all set down by companies on the Green Grass and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and 50s how would you like to have been the person sitting there five thousand men five thousand women figure two children a piece that's twenty thousand people and I'm gonna need you to count to 50. when you get to 50 you get in this group one two three four five six seven eight nine forty five forty six one two three four five six twenty thousand people have to be counted out into groups of one hundred and into groups of fifty before they ever begin to divide the fish and the bread do you see the magnitude of this burden it's getting big it's getting big and so he sits in there and and after that he takes him he breaks the loaves he's breaking the burden just a few loaves and he's breaking this bread and he begins to give it out and they're eating and they're they're having a good time they're getting replenished or re-nourished and that's what they did eat and were filled it says they took up 12 baskets of fragments that 20 000 roughly people it took up 12 baskets what a burden well Watch What Happens and straight away he constrained his disciples they were filled they're full get in the ship we're leaving take the baskets get in the ship we're leaving and they began to go out onto the sea well what happens at night the sea gets boisterous Jesus goes off on a Hillside and he's over praying and having a long time and the Sea gets boisterous and it's being tossed and it says he looks out there and he sees him rowing against the waves and they're trying to save the ship and he goes walking across the water at him and it says he was going to pass them by he's going to pass them by why would he pass them by because he knew they should know what was rightfully theirs they just saw the biggest burden and Miracle of their life performed and he's over been telling them over and over this is for you this is for you this is for you and can you imagine when they see him and call out to him and he steps back in the ship I don't imagine he had to say a whole lot but I would say he probably looked at that basket and done just like this you brethren just watch the greatest miracle that you've ever seen in your life we just had 5 000 20 000 people with a few couple of fishes and some loaves of bread the biggest outpouring of miracle that you could ever Witness and you don't have faith to make it across this water and it says when they when they looked at that and in the miracle of the Loaves and the fishes were brought back to them their hearts were hardened because they knew how could we not believe [Music] The Greatest Story I'm going to get closing with this the greatest story of betrayal and torture and trial and sentence and execution is the story of our Lord Jesus Christ but in the background of all of this is happening God mentions a man named Simon this is not just for a historical reference this is not just a benefit to go throw into the Bible but God is wanting to make sure that this man gets credit you're going to like this listen close from that give me 10 minutes and pay attention he wants to make sure that this man Simon gets credit for carrying the cross of Jesus because with our heavenly father every word has purpose we look at this man Simon and the circumstances surrounding the cross it's a time of execution it's also the time of the Jewish feasts and Passover and they're they're celebrating the Angels passing over back in and Moses's time that's what the Passover is they're celebrating the the death angel passing through and them all making it through under the token of the blood so now Jesus is here and this was an annual Feast that was called that called the Jews back to Jerusalem at that time and so this event Drew Simon of Cyrene and his two sons Rufus and Alexander all the way back to Jerusalem they wasn't there to witness how people were tortured they knew nothing of Jesus they knew nothing of his execution coming they're there to celebrate the Passover but by the powers of this evil world they came face to face with what was happening Upon Jesus that day they've come upon what the procession was of leading to galgotha on that day it says that Simon was from Cyrene which is in North Africa and nobody really knows why he was chosen out of this crowd of people maybe it was because he was big and strong and appeared fit enough to carry this cross and they knew that they could get him up to the streets of galgotha it could have been that God wanted Simon and Simon alone to carry this burden for Jesus but Simon is ordered he didn't have a choice in this read the word it said he was ordered and constrained him Carry the Cross take up that cross and all of a sudden now he has become the primary role player of this execution of Jesus Christ I wonder what Simon heard as he walked through the crowds of people did they talk about the miracles of Jesus did they talk about the healings he performed did they talk about how many he fed or did he hear did he hear the sounds of hosanna Hosanna did he hear uh the the the snares and the smirks from the Pharisees and the Sadducees their accusations their insults towards Jesus Simon no doubt heard the women as they wailed at the punishment that Jesus would went through and the torture that he had went through so here's now Simon he had to wonder how he's going to be viewed by this divided crowd you ever been on a place where you got to wonder what's what's this side going to think and what's this side going to think did he wonder what it was going to be like did he Wonder as he sit there and he think am I helping the Romans am I helping these guys and am I helping them take him to the Cross just to be an executioner or am I here offering compassion to this man called Christ the reason they had to pick you get get somebody out of the crowd is because Jesus has become so weak and so frail and so weary and beaten that he wasn't going to make it he fell under the weight of this cross under the weight of this burden he falls down to the cobblestone the Romans could have that it goes back into the book of Deuteronomy where it says cursed is everyone who is hanged from a tree Jesus had to die on that tree to fulfill scripture and so they say you pick up his cross and you bear his cross to carry that Roman cross was to be identified with death and lawlessness so when people get the wrong idea about Simon Just An Innocent wrong idea about him the scene of Madness and horror there was no escaping it this cross he picked up blood covered heavy no doubt have been used in executions before Blood Stained can you imagine the smell of death as he picked that cross up and he begins to carry this cross down the Trail of Tears and no doubt he's thinking what does all of this mean arriving now at delgatha Simon's burden ends coming up to the to the to the cross up to the hill of Golgotha Simon there now the the Jesus had arrived the suffering the burden the sin had now left off of Simon and been transferred back to Jesus and I can almost see Simon stepping back into the crowd with his two sons now with relief happy to be able to finally lay down the burden and surrender it to Jesus sometimes we grow weary we grow weary under our burdens but just like Simon we have a place to lay those balloons at his feet Jesus may make you pack the cross for a little while you may have to go to trials and tribulations and troubles and burdens but there comes a time when you know Simon has to step down and transfer all of that weight back onto him and say I lay it down at your feet I give it to you there's a blessing for your burdens I'm sure that Simon's Sons were amazed at the events that were taking place and how their father was called out of the crowd and and with the things that were being said about Jesus and no doubt they probably told their father that father father the people many of them love thee they say he's he's the Messiah he's the promised one he done Miracles but these other people there they hate him and then together they watched as Jesus was nailed to the cross One By One The Nails pierced his hands Passover it would forever change as God's perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ would pay the penalty for all sins your sin my sin failure you're shortcoming your sickness your pain your loneliness your suffering your anxiety your fear your doubt the list goes on and on and on and on and on because he's all that you have he's out more than enough we don't have to no longer be slaves as suffering under the death penalty that we should have suffered on her you say well what was the blessing and the burden for Simon this is where it's good this is where God just began to open things up what was the blessing for Simon's burden carrying that cross what was it what could have possibly benefited him if you look and you dig through scriptures you'll find out that it played a big part because Simon of serene he would become a Christian he would take the very message that he saw the very death burial and resurrection that he witnessed on that day and take it back to Africa all right and the scriptures talk about in the book of Acts and the Epistles when they write they talk about Rufus and Alexander his sons they're mentioned in scripture and you say oh that's just coincidence glad you said that listen to what the prophet said years ago There Was An Old Rugged Cross down through Jerusalem and I say it's easy to let me back up it's easy to contradict because Scholars they can't quite put their finger on it they know Rufus and Alexander's mentioned and they know that that was Simon's kids his boys and they know that Mark was writing to that that group of people when he calls them out so they know there's some ties there but they can't quite get it we got somebody got it he said years ago there was an Old Rugged Cross that came down through Jerusalem dragging out the footprints of the bearer on the road up to the hill his little frail body fell Simon of serene came he said he helped him bear the cross and he remembers that he remembers that he knows that now I don't know about you but if God remembers that in 1960 1953 and it revealed it to the prophet that God still remembers that there's a special place for silence Irene somewhere let me take it a step further prophets on a Prayer meeting he's laying hands on the sick Discerning the thoughts the healings are taking place and then it comes up and there's a blank spot on the tape and then he answers he cries out says what and she said the Healer so pick it up with me now say that that man from somewhere up in Arkansas that had been healed that morning the blind shoe cobbler you know the story I've been on the radio and I said I thought I'm going to play the part of a hypocrite and said you don't believe that's the truth do you he's talking to this woman you don't believe that's the truth she said yes sir I do and I said do you believe in this day when God would do something like that she said sir I listened to religious programs I'm a Christian I listen to the programs I heard that man up there was healed this morning that blinds you cobbler they throwed him out of church because he was making so much noise One Church to the other with his hat on his Cane wiggling around running up and down churches everyone in the city hollering I'm Healed I'm Healed the blind shoe cobbler you say what does this have to do with Simon Stay With Me Prophet said do you believe that and she stood there a little bit and it was drizzling rain and she said sir if you'll get me in where he's at then I'll I'm my father then I felt about like that he said said maybe I'm the one you're looking for she grabbed me by the lapels of the code and said is you the Healer no sister but I'm brother Branham she said have mercy and I thought poor old blind Fanny Crosby while on others thou were calling do not pass me by see he had healed one he could heal her too [Music] listen to what happens here he said I put my hands over her eyes and I said dear Jesus one day an Old Rugged Cross came bumping down the street the shoulders with blood running down out of them a little frail body that was packing it fell under the load and a colored man by the name of Simon of Cyrene came up picked up the cross and helped him bear it I'm sure you remember it he's praying to God I'm sure you remember it father and one of his children is standing right here [Applause] Give the Lord a hand clap Simon of serene one of his children was standing right there don't tell me he didn't get God don't tell me he didn't get through the blessings of that burden the burden of carrying that cross saved his entire family all the way down into 1953 when he said here's one of his daughters yeah and she said glory to God I can see glory to God I can see and I said you can see she said yes sir he said how many lights is it she counted the number of Lights in the ceiling said what color suit am I wearing you're wearing a gray suit with a yellow tie I can see I'm Healed there's your blessing Simon a great great great great great granddaughter who was blind and couldn't see there's your blessings because God remembered it as the musicians come kept you long enough God's good brothers and sisters sometimes we get to a place when burdens are almost more than we can bear foreign we're living in we see it more and more and more the pressure the stress School pressure our young people going to schools feel the pressure and the burden of this evil age we're living in your work environments your jobs your careers feeling the pressure and the burdens of this evil age he said the slaves of Egypt the task was so great their backs was so sore their hearts was broken their cries come before God you ever felt that way you ever feel that way that you're under so much at you you just cry out to God and he said they cried out to God till he was forced into a conference sometimes I feel like we don't take our burdens to a conference before God he said there's a way of forcing a conference you can do it in your life it's you can do it in your life it's a showdown the burdens are the people that cries were so great to God forced this conference when God made that decision he said it was already before the foundation of the world and he said that he said he'd done that and there was a man named Moses his servant before the foundation who was chosen to deliver the people but Moses had failed and many times we allow our failures to allow us to hold on to burdens because we're not adequate we're not good enough we've fallen short we failed God we're not good enough so I can't give this to you because I'm not worthy Simon wasn't Worthy he was just a visitor he said that should give us confidence when he said that Moses had failed God he said that should give us confidence and courage for us who has failed God we still have hopes we fail him as a church we fail him as a people but let's call a conference and talk it over let's see what he tells us let's see what the decision he'll derive at foreign if you bow your heads if you just play he touched me sister Becky as we get ready to close the service as you're sitting there this is not a this is not a call for the loss this is not a call for healing this is just a call to simply asked and give you an opportunity to go before God and say God my life has been in turmoil I've been holding on to things to carrying burdens until I can't carry it no more I've carried things over and over and over in my life and I feel like I'm in a place where Jesus was when the cross was just too much and he failed he fell over onto that Cobblestone Road I need a Simon to come my way I need a Simon that will come my way allow me to lift that cross and help me to take that cross help me to carry that burden and to lay it down at Jesus I need to transfer God this load that I'm carrying this weight the stress this pressure I need to transfer it over to the cross and Lord no matter what happens no matter what the outcome is whether I like it whether it whether whether I agree with it I'm going to accept it if there's somebody here this morning that feels burdened and pressured and you just want to stand to your feet do your feet and show Jesus I've been carrying this long enough and I'm gonna stand to my feet and I'm going to raise this burden up to you and I'm going to let it go God bless you God bless you it's nothing to be ashamed of but this is a time of worship this is a time of Deliverance a time of Freedom a time to be set free because you don't have to carry it the burden has been born I could buy a head a heavy burden [Music]
