[43:03] God, and knowing God that you're the
[43:05] author, the finisher of our faith, and
[43:07] you are the author of this book that
[43:09] we're about to open. And we ask, God,
[43:11] that the Holy Spirit would just take,
[43:13] Father, and open the words to us and the
[43:15] understanding of it. Lord, help me never
[43:17] not to say anything wrong, Lord Jesus,
[43:19] but that which is correct, Lord. And
[43:22] father, anoint me, Lord Jesus, to be
[43:23] able to speak it in the manner that it
[43:25] should be spoken, Lord. And Lord, just
[43:28] so to speak, help me to be a burning
[43:30] fire for you, Lord Jesus. As your word
[43:33] has said, he makes his ministers flames
[43:35] of fire, Lord Jesus. And we so we ask
[43:37] God you'd help me to get out of the way
[43:39] and be what I should be Father so that
[43:41] we could properly do this and Father
[43:43] present it to the people in the manner
[43:45] Lord as would be pleasing to you Father
[43:48] and that would go to hearts that need
[43:50] this Lord. We believe God that we have
[43:53] hearts here tonight and each one of us
[43:55] no doubt would have needs and you know
[43:57] just what that is Lord. So we ask your
[44:00] help Lord tonight now as we try to do
[44:02] this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[44:05] Praise the Lord. God is good, isn't he?
[44:08] Let's get right into it. Amen. And Amen.
[44:10] because Amen. I have quite a bit and I
[44:13] don't want to go too long. Amen. But
[44:16] Amen. It will probably be at least my
[44:19] full hour. Amen. We'll see. Amen. Amen.
[44:22] So, if you will turn your Bibles
[44:24] tonight, we'll go to re book of
[44:26] Revelations. I'm just going to go ahead
[44:28] and read some of these scriptures
[44:29] because most likely if I don't, Amen. I
[44:32] won't get to it. Amen. Revelations
[44:35] 20. Revelations
[44:41] 20.
[44:43] Amen. God's courthouse. That's quite a
[44:46] topic, isn't it? Amen. Amen. How can how
[44:50] can uh the church of God be God's
[44:54] hospital? Amen. We preached that the
[44:55] church is God's hospital Sunday. Is that
[44:58] right? And now we're going to make it
[45:00] God's courthouse. Amen. God's
[45:04] courthouse. Amen. And we'll try to pull
[45:07] that together for you. Amen. So you'll
[45:14] understand. Revelations 20 and verse 11.
[45:17] And I saw a great white throne, and him
[45:19] that sat on it, from whose face the
[45:22] earth and the heaven fled away, and
[45:24] there was found no place for them. And I
[45:26] saw the dead, small and great, stand
[45:28] before God, and the books were opened.
[45:31] And another book was open, which is the
[45:33] book of life, and the dead were judged
[45:34] out of those things which were written
[45:37] in the books, according to their works.
[45:40] And the sea gave up the dead which were
[45:42] in it. And death and hell delivered up
[45:44] the dead that were in it. And they were
[45:47] judged, every man, according to their
[45:50] works. And death and hell were cast into
[45:53] the lake of fire. This is the second
[45:54] death. And whosoever was not found
[45:57] written in the book of life was cast
[45:59] into the lake of fire. Amen. Let's go to
[46:04] another one if we could. Let's go to
[46:07] um first Peter. First
[46:16] Peter.
[46:18] Actually, let's go versus
[46:22] St. John 16 if you will.
[46:26] St. John 16 and then we'll go to second
[46:28] Peter or Peter 1 Peter 4. Okay. St. John
[46:33] 16 and
[46:35] verse 7. Amen. And this is kind of where
[46:38] I got my thought. Amen. When I was
[46:40] speaking to you about the comfort of the
[46:42] Holy Spirit that God has sent to us.
[46:44] Amen. To give us comfort. Ain't that
[46:46] right? Amen. And then it says something
[46:48] in there that kind of uh Amen. just kind
[46:51] of extended this that I wanted to get
[46:53] into. Amen. in a couple of pages that I
[46:55] didn't have amen time to get into.
[46:57] Nevertheless, verse 7, nevertheless, I
[47:00] tell you the truth. He says, "It is
[47:02] expedient for you that I go away. If I
[47:04] go not away, the comforter will not come
[47:08] unto you. But if I depart, I will send
[47:11] him unto you. And when he is come,
[47:14] Amen." Now, notice what this comforter
[47:16] will do. This comforter, when he comes,
[47:18] he will reprove the world of sin. Amen.
[47:22] So, it's not just to give you comfort,
[47:25] but discomforter will speak. Isn't that
[47:27] right? It'll speak of sin and of
[47:31] righteousness and of judgment. Amen.
[47:36] Notice how it has all three of those. Of
[47:39] sin because they believe not on me. Of
[47:42] righteousness because I go to the father
[47:44] and ye see me no more. Of judgment
[47:46] because the prince of this world is
[47:50] judged.
[47:52] 1 Peter
[47:54] 4, 1 Peter 4 and verse 17, it says it
[47:57] this way. For the time is come that
[48:00] judgment must begin at the house of God.
[48:03] And if it first begin at us, where shall
[48:05] be the end of them that obey not the
[48:07] gospel of God. You can be seated. May
[48:10] God add his blessings to the reading of
[48:12] the word. Brother Bam says it this way.
[48:14] He says, "Now in this study, my
[48:19] purpose, my purpose of this is not just
[48:22] to come here to fellowship with you
[48:24] people, which I love to do that. If I
[48:26] had a chance to do that, I would come to
[48:28] your house. I'd shake your hand and talk
[48:31] with you and sit down, eat dinner with
[48:33] you, and sit under the shade tree and
[48:36] talk." Amen. And fellowship a while.
[48:40] But when we come here, we are here for
[48:43] one specific purpose. This is the house
[48:47] of correction.
[48:50] This is the throne.
[48:55] Amen. And judgment goes forth from the
[48:59] house of God. And here's where we come
[49:02] together, gather in love with one
[49:04] another as only Christians can do. Amen.
[49:08] We are here to take reckoning among
[49:11] oursel to see where our short places
[49:14] are, our shortcomings and how we can
[49:17] catch from where we should be over here
[49:20] to where we ought to be. Amen. Amen.
[49:23] Where we ought to be. And that's what we
[49:25] study. Ministers study those places.
[49:28] Amen. So we want to start by saying we
[49:33] realize and we're real grateful to
[49:36] understand understand the purpose of
[49:38] humanity.
[49:40] Amen. And that everybody according to
[49:43] the prophet of God I won't pull all
[49:44] these quotes up but we know that brother
[49:46] Bam said that every child when it is
[49:48] born God begins a recorder of that
[49:51] little
[49:53] baby. Amen. That's right. You know,
[49:56] we're living in a world where everybody
[49:58] has a iPhone and nobody can't do
[50:00] nothing. Even the cops have got these
[50:02] little cameras and so forth, you know,
[50:04] so they'll can record it. Is that right?
[50:06] Because I'll tell you what, it'll stand
[50:08] up in court when you've got a recording.
[50:11] I got it on video. I got it on video. I
[50:13] got it on tape. You know, and so it's a
[50:15] real, you know, and brother Bam said,
[50:17] you know, that God does the same thing
[50:20] that he records all the way from the
[50:23] beginning to the end. He records
[50:25] everything we
[50:27] do.
[50:29] Amen. And like I said, the the uh the
[50:33] the part of judgment I want to talk
[50:35] really I want to speak of two judgments
[50:37] if I can with the help of the Lord.
[50:39] Amen. We know that this one judgment is
[50:41] of course at the end of the
[50:43] thousand-year reign. There's a thousand
[50:45] years. Amen. The millennium will happen.
[50:48] All of those lost folks. Amen. That
[50:50] don't go in the rapture. How many know
[50:52] they don't come up till after the
[50:53] thousand years? That's the white throne
[50:57] judgment. Amen. But there's another
[50:59] judgment that's going on right here.
[51:03] Amen. Tonight, we're here, like brother
[51:07] Bam said, to reckon. Amen. Take
[51:10] reckoning of ourselves.
[51:13] Amen. Take reckoning of ourselves. So,
[51:15] this is the house of God's judgment.
[51:22] Amen. And the thing I want to bring out
[51:25] is we realize that every
[51:29] motion, every
[51:31] uh every uh color, the color of the
[51:34] clothes that you wear, in other words, I
[51:37] believe what the prophet was trying to
[51:38] say that whenever God plays this record
[51:40] in heaven, it's going to be in color.
[51:43] How many believes it'll probably be very
[51:45] much in high death?
[51:47] Yeah, it'll be high def. you know, it'll
[51:49] be very, very clear. Amen. It ain't
[51:53] going to have these uh like they used to
[51:54] have when you watch TV, you know, and
[51:56] the screen that go blank and everything.
[51:58] You can't have a judgment with that
[52:00] going on, right? It'll all be clear.
[52:04] That's right. It'll all be very clear on
[52:07] that
[52:07] day. And the humanity, what they don't
[52:10] understand is that they you will have to
[52:14] give an account for everything that you
[52:16] have ever done. said, every deed, every
[52:20] emotion, every thought that has ever
[52:22] went through your mind, it has to be
[52:25] answered
[52:27] for. How many believe that you are
[52:30] accountable? People don't think that
[52:32] they're accountable. Our judges nowadays
[52:34] let them get away with just about
[52:36] everything. But that judge, he's not
[52:38] going to let nobody get away with
[52:41] anything. Amen. It causes something. And
[52:44] I always just want to start with this.
[52:45] You know, uh, brother Bam, he makes us
[52:48] makes a statement, you know, when he was
[52:49] preaching, I believe in, uh, when he
[52:51] preached on Jonah and how that man and,
[52:54] you know, how he sherks
[52:56] responsibilities. Ain't that right? When
[52:58] he preached Jonah and how he went to
[53:00] Tarsus instead of Nineveh the way he was
[53:03] supposed to, he goes some other way. And
[53:05] we as human beings, we like to sh the
[53:08] responsibility. Amen. People like to
[53:10] sherk the responsibility. Amen. But you
[53:13] can't. There's something that you can't
[53:18] sherk. God forces responsibility upon
[53:28] us. Amen. You want to get married?
[53:31] Wonderful. Guess what? You're going to
[53:33] have more responsibility.
[53:37] It's all responsible. Brother Bam talked
[53:39] about get married, have children,
[53:40] everything and all the smudge and
[53:42] everything else that comes along with
[53:43] it.
[53:44] Amen. Life in general is a
[53:47] responsibility. Young kids, listen.
[53:50] Thank God. If your parents teach you to
[53:52] work and and so forth.
[53:56] Amen. Amen. I was told the other day
[53:58] that little eml made the family supper.
[54:00] Little eml making the family supper. I
[54:03] was like, "Yeah, yeah. I'll tell you
[54:05] what, that's what we need to have doing
[54:07] them little kids. have them know how to
[54:08] make supper long before six me six years
[54:12] into their marriage and finally be able
[54:13] to how to cook a hot
[54:18] dog. Learn responsibility a little
[54:21] early. Are you with me? But whether you
[54:24] like it or not, guess what? You have the
[54:26] responsibility of when you grew up,
[54:28] you're going to have to get a job.
[54:29] You're going to have to make a living or
[54:31] you're going to have to be a bum. You
[54:33] got to make a choice of what you're
[54:34] going to be. That responsibility is on
[54:36] you.
[54:41] Amen. And it creates a
[54:43] pressure. Amen. So we know that that
[54:46] whether man wants that ad minute or not,
[54:48] whether they want to sherk that
[54:49] responsibility, Amen. They still have to
[54:52] make a choice and it's on them and
[54:54] they're going to have to give an answer
[54:55] for it. Brother Bam says, you know, man
[54:58] is forced to make a decision.
[55:02] I mean, we got you got there's the time
[55:05] you've got to make
[55:07] decisions. Man was forced. Amen. In the
[55:11] first days of Christ, Amen. What was
[55:13] they forced to do? They were forced
[55:15] first to accept him or reject him. He
[55:18] showed all of his signs, his seal, his
[55:21] messiahship. Amen. By just exactly what
[55:24] the Bible said he would do and so forth.
[55:26] And they had to make a choice. Listen,
[55:28] he says they were forced to make a
[55:31] decision. They could not hold it any
[55:36] longer. Amen. And neither can the
[55:39] Pentecostal church or the Baptist or the
[55:42] Presbyterian, the Holy Ghost. Christ is
[55:44] arisen and he's in the church. Amen. How
[55:48] many believes that? There's no denying
[55:51] it. Those signs, those wonders, you got
[55:55] to say yes, it's of God or it's no of
[55:57] God. You got to make a choice. You got
[55:59] to make a judgment. You got to decide.
[56:02] You're
[56:03] responsible. Every age was
[56:06] responsible. So the bad thing to do is
[56:09] to face up to responsibility.
[56:13] Praise the
[56:15] Lord.
[56:18] Amen. See, they refused his messiahship
[56:21] when he showed them that he was Messiah.
[56:23] But they were forced to say something.
[56:26] And so are they today turning it down,
[56:28] won't sponsor it, washing their hands
[56:31] from it. The decision is forced upon
[56:34] them. There's no middle road. We're at
[56:37] the end time. Man's forced to receive it
[56:41] or to reject
[56:42] it.
[56:45] Amen. You've got to accept it or you've
[56:47] got to turn it away. It's forced upon
[56:49] America. It's forced upon the Brandham
[56:51] Tabernacle. It's forced upon the
[56:53] Pentecostal Methodist. forced
[56:55] everywhere. You have to take it or you
[56:56] got to leave it. God is confirming his
[56:58] word, showing signs, backing his
[57:00] ministry. Amen. Showing exactly what he
[57:03] is, proving that he is alive and well.
[57:07] Amen. So we are forced. We have a
[57:11] responsibility. I called it we have the
[57:13] responsibility of accountability.
[57:17] Accountability is responsibility. When
[57:20] you let your kids get away with
[57:21] everything all their life, they won't
[57:23] amount to hill of beans.
[57:25] You can't let them get away with That's
[57:27] why sometimes you got to take the sick
[57:29] to them and you got to take, you know,
[57:31] and really teach them, hey, when you do
[57:32] something like that, there's
[57:34] consequences.
[57:36] That's why we got the renegades that we
[57:37] got today. They don't think there's any
[57:39] consequences.
[57:44] Amen. That's right. But there is. You
[57:47] got to take that responsibility. Praise
[57:50] the Lord. Now, as we come into this
[57:52] courthouse, let's talk about coming into
[57:54] the courthouse. When you come into this
[57:57] courthouse, it's quite
[57:59] unique. And I want to ask you this
[58:01] question. When you come into this
[58:04] courthouse, who's the
[58:07] judge? Who is the judge in this
[58:09] courthouse?
[58:11] Because when we come into this
[58:12] courthouse, we come into the courthouse
[58:15] knowing that we are guilty. For all men
[58:19] have sinned and come short of the glory
[58:21] of
[58:25] God.
[58:28] Amen. Come short of the glory of God.
[58:31] Don't say that you're not. You are.
[58:32] You're guilty. Everybody comes to
[58:34] courthouse. Otherwise, you wouldn't have
[58:35] to go to a courthouse. Amen.
[58:39] Why do you think people don't like to go
[58:41] to church? People don't like to have
[58:43] their toes stepped
[58:45] on. And I just want to say something.
[58:47] You know, it's something about
[58:49] Christians. We as Christians don't mind
[58:51] going to church. And we don't mind being
[58:54] corrected
[58:57] because we know that all of our deeds,
[59:00] you don't get away with anything. You
[59:02] don't get away with no secret sin. You
[59:04] don't get away with one secret thought.
[59:06] You don't get away with it. No.
[59:12] So I want to say this
[59:14] evening that the
[59:16] judge the judge in this courthouse is
[59:20] you.
[59:23] You are the
[59:29] judge. Kind of different. You think,
[59:31] well, God is the judge. No, God's
[59:33] already judged you. Ain't that right? I
[59:36] mean the law has already condemned you.
[59:37] The devil wants to damn you to hell.
[59:40] Ain't that
[59:41] right? But Jesus said, God said uh he
[59:45] John said in this, let me just say read
[59:47] it
[59:48] here. Let's see what Jesus said
[59:53] here. What his judgment
[59:58] is. John
[1:00:02] 3, very familiar scripture. You see,
[1:00:05] when you come in here, it says God so
[1:00:07] loved the world. He loves you that he
[1:00:10] gave his only begotten son that
[1:00:12] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:00:14] perish but have everlasting life. For
[1:00:16] God sent not his son into the world to
[1:00:18] condemn it, not to bring it to judgment
[1:00:21] or to damn it. He came to save it, but
[1:00:25] that the world through him might be
[1:00:27] saved. He that believeth on him is not
[1:00:30] condemned, but he that believeth not is
[1:00:32] condemned
[1:00:33] already because he hath not believed in
[1:00:36] the name of the only begotten son of
[1:00:37] God. And this is the condemnation that
[1:00:40] light is coming to the world and men
[1:00:43] love darkness rather than light because
[1:00:45] their dearings are evil. That's the
[1:00:47] judgment. That's where the judgment lays
[1:00:50] is light has come. salvation has come
[1:00:54] and people would rather not take it
[1:00:58] not accept
[1:01:00] that we as human beings whether you're
[1:01:04] in a
[1:01:05] war whether it's George Washington
[1:01:08] crawling crossing the Delaware at night
[1:01:10] and finding any means whether it's
[1:01:13] through uh what do you call it uh I
[1:01:16] forget what kind of tactics they use
[1:01:19] rebel tactics or you you know, just
[1:01:21] hitting them here and there instead of
[1:01:23] head head on. Anything human beings, you
[1:01:26] take you take any real desperate
[1:01:30] situation in human beings and human
[1:01:32] lives and and the people that'll risk
[1:01:34] their lives to try to save somebody. And
[1:01:37] you know, we're we're survivors.
[1:01:41] We're heroic when it comes to
[1:01:45] surviving. But when it comes to saving
[1:01:48] our own
[1:01:49] lives, when it comes to people caring
[1:01:52] about their life, they're not so
[1:01:56] much. Amen.
[1:01:59] Cuz how many know we know that there's
[1:02:01] only salvation through Jesus Christ? If
[1:02:03] they knew that there's only salvation
[1:02:05] through Jesus Christ and that he died
[1:02:07] for them on Calvary so that they would
[1:02:09] not have to perish. If they would
[1:02:10] realize they could have ever your life
[1:02:13] depends on it. Care about it.
[1:02:18] You got to care.
[1:02:21] Brother Brandham even preached a
[1:02:22] message. He cares. Do you care? I want
[1:02:26] to see. He cared. Now it's your turn to
[1:02:29] care. Even in that message, Brother Bam
[1:02:31] says, "When you care, he cares. But if
[1:02:33] you don't care, he don't care."
[1:02:37] Huh? He put it that way. He says, "You
[1:02:40] got to care." He believe it's a correct
[1:02:42] quote. You got to care first, then he'll
[1:02:45] care because he already
[1:02:47] cared. You've got to be concerned about
[1:02:51] yourself. And only Christians are coming
[1:02:54] on a Wednesday. Only real Christians,
[1:02:56] amen, will will hear about a a pillar of
[1:02:59] fire or a prophet or or whatever and
[1:03:01] say, "Really, God did something like
[1:03:03] that?" Everybody else, "Well, my church
[1:03:05] don't teach that." What about all the
[1:03:07] miracles, the dead that are
[1:03:09] raised? Is that right? Jesus said in his
[1:03:13] hour, Amen. He said in his hour, you
[1:03:16] can't believe me, believe the works that
[1:03:18] I
[1:03:21] do. I'm not going to have time. But
[1:03:24] anyway, over in Matthew 11 in verse 16
[1:03:28] is where we started from. He was talking
[1:03:30] about the children sitting in the
[1:03:32] markets and calling to their fellows.
[1:03:34] And two scriptures later, he began to
[1:03:36] upgrade the cities wherein most of his
[1:03:39] mighty works were done because they
[1:03:41] repented
[1:03:43] not. Amen. So if you'll notice that even
[1:03:47] Jesus after
[1:03:49] preaching, he kind of preached judgment
[1:03:52] also. Ain't that right? When he when
[1:03:55] they were rejected, when he was
[1:03:56] rejected, he preached judgment. Oh
[1:03:59] Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how I would have
[1:04:01] hovered thee and taken you under my
[1:04:03] wings as a hand as a brood, but you
[1:04:06] would not. Now your house is left to you
[1:04:09] desolate.
[1:04:12] Isn't that right?
[1:04:15] But here he says up braided in the city
[1:04:18] wherein most of his mighty works were
[1:04:20] done because they repented
[1:04:25] not. Woe unto thee Corinth. Wo unto you
[1:04:28] besida for if the mighty works which
[1:04:30] were done in
[1:04:32] you had been done in Ty and Siden they
[1:04:35] would have repented long ago and
[1:04:37] sackcloth and ashes.
[1:04:40] And I say unto you, it shall be more
[1:04:42] tolerable entire and siden at the day of
[1:04:44] judgment than for you. And oh capernium,
[1:04:47] which are exalted to heaven. Remember
[1:04:49] said, oh Los Angeles, Los Angeles, that
[1:04:51] sends out all the filthy all over the
[1:04:54] world. How God would have taken you, but
[1:04:56] there's a great sandbar beneath you,
[1:04:59] judgment laying right beneath you. And
[1:05:03] he went on as I studied, he says, a lot
[1:05:05] of times a prophet will speak something
[1:05:06] and it won't happen for that generation.
[1:05:09] It'll happen way down the road, but it
[1:05:11] will happen.
[1:05:16] How many believes it's going to happen?
[1:05:21] Amen. Something I don't want to get
[1:05:22] into, but brother Bam talks about a
[1:05:24] temporary judgment. Ain't that right?
[1:05:25] Just like Martin Luther common, look at
[1:05:27] Germany. What happened to them? Look at
[1:05:29] the judgment come upon them. England,
[1:05:31] look at the judgment that come upon
[1:05:32] them. We've had a prophet in our
[1:05:35] generation for America.
[1:05:38] Where's our judgment?
[1:05:40] I'll tell you, it's in the hangers. It's
[1:05:42] waiting. Brother Brandham's seen it all
[1:05:44] burnt over as far as the eye could see.
[1:05:46] And he calls it a temporary judgment
[1:05:48] because on that great day is a great
[1:05:50] judgment. But when you turn down God's
[1:05:52] prophets and God's people, amen, you're
[1:05:55] in for judgment.
[1:05:57] But it's there. Listen, mighty works
[1:05:59] have been done. Think about it. It been
[1:06:01] standing. But it I say unto you, it
[1:06:04] shall be more tolerable for the land of
[1:06:06] Sodom.
[1:06:08] Sodom. Woo. Think about it. Then for
[1:06:12] thee, so even Jesus bringing a a
[1:06:15] judgment. I mean, after having preached
[1:06:17] to him, how many knows there's a
[1:06:20] penalty? You don't have to love the
[1:06:22] Lord. God wants you to love him. He
[1:06:23] sheds all of his love. He wants to love.
[1:06:25] He wants people to love him. But one
[1:06:27] thing's for sure, if you don't, you'll
[1:06:30] still pay. you'll still answer for all
[1:06:33] of your needs.
[1:06:39] Amen. Nobody's getting away with
[1:06:42] anything. Praise the Lord. All right.
[1:06:46] When I think and notice when I think of
[1:06:48] God's great program and to think that we
[1:06:51] poor, alienated, ungodly, undone sinners
[1:06:55] have the privilege of coming to his
[1:06:56] place and accepting him and becoming
[1:06:59] sons and daughters. My why, he says, it
[1:07:03] does not yet appear what we shall be,
[1:07:04] but we know that we'll have a body like
[1:07:05] into his own glorious body. What a
[1:07:08] wonderful thing. Eating and drinking
[1:07:10] just like he did. Now, God has made a
[1:07:14] preparation. Amen. How many knows God
[1:07:16] has made a way of escape? God has made a
[1:07:19] preparation.
[1:07:23] Amen. When he was going to destroy the
[1:07:26] first world, before he destroyed the
[1:07:27] world, he sent for the preparation for
[1:07:29] saving of the people that desired to be
[1:07:32] saved. He always does. 120 years of
[1:07:36] grace, 120 years of mercy.
[1:07:40] You realize it's been a if uh if you if
[1:07:42] we would say that brother Benham's
[1:07:44] ministry started when he was around 20
[1:07:46] years old I think it's about when he got
[1:07:47] married and started preaching and so
[1:07:49] forth 1920 and and and
[1:07:53] uh not 1920 but 1930 because he was born
[1:07:58] in 1909 20 years later would be around
[1:08:01] uh around 1930. This is 2025. We put it
[1:08:06] at 95 years
[1:08:09] already. 95 years. It's
[1:08:13] been I wonder if God will let it go
[1:08:15] close to 120. I don't know. All I know
[1:08:18] is that those Jews that were born right
[1:08:20] around 1947. And so that generation
[1:08:23] shall not pass till all these things be
[1:08:25] fulfilled. And that's they're getting
[1:08:26] pretty old. I mean, it won't be much
[1:08:29] longer. We ain't got always going to
[1:08:31] come to the church on Wednesday night.
[1:08:33] Amen. One of these days it's going to be
[1:08:35] over.
[1:08:38] And we come here to search the heart,
[1:08:40] search the life, see God, is there any
[1:08:42] wicked way in me? If there is, take it
[1:08:44] out.
[1:08:48] Now, the peculiar thing about this
[1:08:50] judgment house and this judgment is that
[1:08:53] there's pardon. There's mercy in this
[1:08:55] judgment house.
[1:08:59] How many glad for that? That's right.
[1:09:01] There's mercy. There's a tub of bleach.
[1:09:04] There's a
[1:09:05] blood. God comes and says, "Yeah, you're
[1:09:08] guilty. You're a low down rotten
[1:09:09] sinner." Yeah, you got to confess. You
[1:09:11] say, "Yeah, that's right. I'm guilty.
[1:09:14] I'm guilty and I'm sorry that I'm
[1:09:17] guilty." A judge usually wants to judge
[1:09:19] usually looks for remorse in a person.
[1:09:22] And if he don't have remorse, he gives
[1:09:24] him the full
[1:09:25] sentence. How many believes God is
[1:09:27] looking for remorse? If you come and you
[1:09:29] are remorseful, you're sorry for your
[1:09:31] sins, and you're willing to repent,
[1:09:34] there's pardon for you.
[1:09:37] There's pardon for you in this jewel
[1:09:38] courthouse.
[1:09:40] No matter what the brother Joe Adams or
[1:09:42] anybody other preacher comes up here,
[1:09:44] Amen, and says
[1:09:46] things, Amen. Whether it's the clothes
[1:09:48] that you wear, the high heels that you
[1:09:51] have, to not cutting your hair or
[1:09:53] wearing makeup or shorts and all these
[1:09:55] other stuff. Hello. No matter what it
[1:09:58] is, there's mercy for
[1:10:01] us. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:04] Amen. Hallelujah. How many knows Paul
[1:10:07] said, "Don't uh he said
[1:10:13] can I'll try to talk some here in a
[1:10:18] minute." First Corinthians, I believe it
[1:10:24] is. Dare any of you having a matter
[1:10:27] against another, go to law before the
[1:10:28] unjust and not before the
[1:10:31] saints. In other words, if you got a
[1:10:33] matter, bring it before the
[1:10:35] saints. Do you not know that the saints
[1:10:38] shall judge the world?
[1:10:41] Amen. How many believe that a saint is
[1:10:45] used to judging?
[1:10:49] You have to judge yourself. See whether
[1:10:51] you're in the faith or not. Judge
[1:10:53] yourself. see if you have any sin before
[1:10:56] taking a communion and so forth. Look at
[1:10:59] yourself. Judge yourself.
[1:11:01] For if we would judge
[1:11:03] ourselves, we should not be judged. So
[1:11:06] God says, if you'll judge yourself, you
[1:11:09] ain't got to be at the judgment because
[1:11:11] there's no condemnation to them that are
[1:11:13] get dipped in the blood.
[1:11:17] Brother Bannon, many times in St. John
[1:11:20] uh 5:14 I believe it was he says he that
[1:11:22] believeth my word amen has everlasting
[1:11:25] life and shall not come into
[1:11:26] condemnation shall not come to the
[1:11:29] judgment Daniel said he cometh with 10
[1:11:32] thousands times 10 thousands of his
[1:11:34] saints to judge the world how many knows
[1:11:36] when God judges the world the bride is
[1:11:39] there with them
[1:11:42] I'll just say it comes to mind brothers
[1:11:44] said that a pastor of an area will judge
[1:11:46] that
[1:11:51] Lord help me. Lord help us, brother
[1:11:53] Brad. We're
[1:11:56] ministers, but he says you can't judge
[1:11:58] the smallest
[1:12:00] matter. Got some good stuff. Are y'all
[1:12:03] ready for it?
[1:12:04] Amen. Now notice, so we know that God
[1:12:07] made the
[1:12:08] preparation. He made everything ready.
[1:12:11] He did everything for us. Amen.
[1:12:15] Now notice to save those that desire to
[1:12:18] be saved. He always does it. He shows
[1:12:21] mercy before
[1:12:23] judgment. And if men burn mercy, there's
[1:12:26] only one thing left and that is
[1:12:31] judgment. And God don't judge you. You
[1:12:36] judge
[1:12:38] yourself. Right.
[1:12:43] Are y'all ready for some heavy stuff?
[1:12:46] Here it comes. Now, tonight when you
[1:12:48] talk about divine healing, you say,
[1:12:50] "Well, I don't believe it." Well, then
[1:12:51] you couldn't get healed. No way. There's
[1:12:54] no hope for you because you already
[1:12:56] judged yourself. Amen. When you reject
[1:12:59] Jesus Christ and Savior and God, you
[1:13:02] don't have to be judged. You're already
[1:13:04] judged. Your attitude towards God's
[1:13:07] provided way has judged you. It's not
[1:13:10] necessary that any man will go to hell.
[1:13:13] And God don't send no one to hell. You
[1:13:15] sent yourself to hell.
[1:13:19] Woo! What a courthouse.
[1:13:23] Don't don't don't don't ah that brother,
[1:13:26] that preacher stumbled me. That person
[1:13:28] stop. Don't give me no excuses.
[1:13:30] It's the blood of Jesus Christ that you
[1:13:32] got to accept. Amen. It's him that you
[1:13:35] got to go through.
[1:13:37] Amen.
[1:13:39] Praise be. You said yourself though.
[1:13:41] God's done everything in the world that
[1:13:43] he can do to keep you from going.
[1:13:49] To think about it. When you come into
[1:13:51] this courthouse, the devil says, "Well,
[1:13:53] now you know you're a sinner. You you
[1:13:54] know you you are not worthy to be
[1:13:57] forgiven.
[1:14:01] You're too rotten. You did it too many
[1:14:02] times. You're a sinner. you. He'll try
[1:14:04] to condemn you and God will say, you
[1:14:07] know, I know you're guilty. You're
[1:14:09] guilty as guilty can be, but guess what?
[1:14:12] We have one sitting over here at the
[1:14:14] mediator between God and man, and we've
[1:14:17] got a pardon for
[1:14:19] you. That's the kind of courthouse I
[1:14:21] like where there's
[1:14:23] pardon. Just go over there and get your
[1:14:28] pardon. We're standing on the steps of
[1:14:30] the courthouse, brother B. Hey,
[1:14:32] everybody. All you that have done wrong,
[1:14:34] all you cheaters, liars, thieers,
[1:14:36] adultery, committed, all of you, come on
[1:14:38] in here. This house has got pardon for
[1:14:41] all of you. Whosoever will, let him
[1:14:44] come. Whosoever believeth on him shall
[1:14:46] not be condemned. Come. There's a
[1:14:48] pardon. Come get your pardon. Come get
[1:14:51] your pardon.
[1:14:54] That's the kind of courthouse we have
[1:14:58] today.
[1:14:59] Amen. I like that courthouse. Praise the
[1:15:03] Lord.
[1:15:04] There's a bleach. There's a tub. Repent.
[1:15:12] You would think that if human beings
[1:15:13] were survivors, there'd be more
[1:15:16] Christians. You think this house was
[1:15:18] full? Our balcony should be
[1:15:21] full with who? All the Baptist, the
[1:15:24] Presbyterian, and all of them
[1:15:26] folks. Huh? when you come have show them
[1:15:30] that Jesus Christ came in our day and
[1:15:33] vindicated a prophet of God and told us
[1:15:36] the
[1:15:37] truth. But guess what? There's only one
[1:15:41] condemnation. Jesus said they love
[1:15:43] darkness rather than light.
[1:15:50] I got some heavy stuff for you. Listen
[1:15:52] to this.
[1:15:57] Oh
[1:15:59] my. All right. So, you send yourself to
[1:16:01] hell. God's done everything in the world
[1:16:03] he can do to keep you from going to
[1:16:06] hell. And he lets you determine to go to
[1:16:12] hell. You've got to determine yourself.
[1:16:17] You've got to by free moral agency make
[1:16:20] that
[1:16:21] judgment. Will I accept it or will I
[1:16:24] refuse it? Make a judgment.
[1:16:28] How many you got to you got to make that
[1:16:31] choice. Will I serve God or will I serve
[1:16:34] the devil?
[1:16:36] The devil voted against you. God votes
[1:16:39] for you. Now, which way do you judge?
[1:16:42] He's in that court house listening.
[1:16:43] Which way are you going to do? Do you
[1:16:45] know you're a judge? Would it be
[1:16:48] something to be a judge? Judge? Yeah,
[1:16:50] you are a judge. You have to
[1:16:52] judge because guess what? We're going to
[1:16:54] re we're going to end up in some
[1:16:56] destination somewhere. You will end up
[1:17:00] somewhere. And that somewhere is either
[1:17:02] in the lake of fire, eternal damnation,
[1:17:06] or in heaven.
[1:17:10] What if I told you or some purgatory
[1:17:12] over here where all of those that don't
[1:17:13] want the responsibility and just don't
[1:17:15] want to make a choice that God just puts
[1:17:16] them over there? You false prophet,
[1:17:21] lion, devil.
[1:17:23] is one or the other. You either end up
[1:17:27] in heaven or you end up in hell. Decide.
[1:17:31] You decide. Can you imagine God saying,
[1:17:34] "You
[1:17:36] decide." And he has.
[1:17:40] He has given you that choice. You're a
[1:17:42] free moral agent.
[1:17:47] Oh, aren't you glad that you have
[1:17:48] decided to follow Jesus? No turning
[1:17:51] back. No turning back. You take this
[1:17:53] whole world. Just give me
[1:17:59] Jesus. Amen. We care about every little
[1:18:02] thing about ourselves, don't we? You
[1:18:04] should. Every one of us should care
[1:18:06] about it because a lot of people just
[1:18:08] don't care. That's the problem with the
[1:18:10] world. They don't care about their soul.
[1:18:12] They don't care about how they live.
[1:18:13] They don't care how about they look.
[1:18:15] They sure don't care about how they
[1:18:17] dress. And no care about their soul. But
[1:18:21] you and I
[1:18:24] do when it comes to honesty and when it
[1:18:27] comes to caring about every little thing
[1:18:29] that you do. Remember, hope came back
[1:18:31] from heaven. And she said, "Honey, I got
[1:18:33] something to tell you." That time that I
[1:18:36] that you brought me those wrong socks, I
[1:18:38] never told you those was the wrong
[1:18:39] socks. I just want to tell you those
[1:18:41] were the wrong
[1:18:42] socks. All the way from heaven to tell
[1:18:44] him had the wrong socks.
[1:18:49] How many knows every deed is recorded?
[1:18:51] Every thought. A real Christian wants to
[1:18:54] be right. We want our sins open before
[1:18:57] God.
[1:19:02] Amen. That's
[1:19:10] right. First Timothy.
[1:19:14] First
[1:19:20] Timothy
[1:19:25] 5 and verse 24 says, "Some men's sins
[1:19:30] are open
[1:19:32] beforehand, going before to judgment,
[1:19:37] and some follow after." How many know
[1:19:41] that prophet taught us that you don't
[1:19:42] want to be the latter?
[1:19:45] No, I'd rather have him go first. Why?
[1:19:47] That's why we come now. Lord, Lord, I'm
[1:19:50] guilty. Lord, forgive me. Yeah, I admit
[1:19:53] it. But Lord, I want mercy. Well,
[1:19:56] there's
[1:19:57] mercy. Oh, Brother Bam says, "Man,
[1:19:59] there's only one way to stop that tape
[1:20:01] playing. Only one way to get rid of them
[1:20:03] sins, and that's to drop them in the
[1:20:05] blood of Jesus Christ. Drop them under
[1:20:07] repentance. Say, God, forgive me for
[1:20:09] that." Amen. only one way. And think
[1:20:14] about how that people will take every
[1:20:17] substitute to try to find some comfort,
[1:20:20] some peace. All them drugs, all the
[1:20:22] pleasures, all that they do to try to
[1:20:25] satisfy, to quench that thing, that that
[1:20:28] conscience of theirs, they just can't
[1:20:30] get away from it. I believe Brother Bam
[1:20:32] said, "You take the most cruel man when
[1:20:34] they come down to the door of death,
[1:20:36] they get sobered up. They recognize
[1:20:39] there's a God." Hello.
[1:20:41] If I'm I was thinking how that Hitler
[1:20:43] and and and here some of his lieutenants
[1:20:46] and how that they committed suicide
[1:20:48] thinking that that was their way of
[1:20:50] escape. They didn't escape
[1:20:53] anything. Amen. They might have escaped
[1:20:56] the United States. They might escaped
[1:20:59] the
[1:21:00] hanging. I'd imagine that Sinai was
[1:21:03] about as painful as anything. But the
[1:21:06] God that knows and sees, he'll call them
[1:21:08] back. Amen.
[1:21:11] Oh my.
[1:21:13] Okay. He let you determine whether
[1:21:16] you're going to go to hell or
[1:21:21] not.
[1:21:23] Wow. Lord help us. That ought to every
[1:21:27] young person because you got to make
[1:21:29] choices as you get old. You've got to
[1:21:31] make some choices.
[1:21:33] Where you where you going to end up at?
[1:21:36] Who are you going to serve?
[1:21:41] Whether or not you go to
[1:21:44] hell is up to you. In other words, he
[1:21:48] God said, "I've wrote to
[1:21:52] pardon. I've forgiven all if you'll
[1:21:55] accept it and you'll receive it the way
[1:21:57] that I give it to you."
[1:22:00] Now, it's up to you.
[1:22:05] Don't you think that ought to ring out
[1:22:08] in our White House? It ought to ring all
[1:22:10] across the world. You will determine
[1:22:13] where you spend eternity. Make your
[1:22:16] choice. Christ has done everything. He
[1:22:19] loves. He's not willing that any should
[1:22:21] perish. He's made every provision
[1:22:25] and he lays it in your lap. Now go ahead
[1:22:28] and decide. You judge yourself.
[1:22:34] Wow. See, you fight right over every
[1:22:38] barricade that God puts in your way.
[1:22:41] Amen. People just run over
[1:22:44] it. I was listening to warning in
[1:22:48] judgment and brother Brandon was
[1:22:50] speaking of I think it's Hezekiah if I'm
[1:22:53] not wrong that wanted 15 extra years.
[1:22:56] And brother Brandon makes a statement
[1:22:58] nobody God don't let anybody die without
[1:23:00] giving them a warning.
[1:23:02] He said, 'N nobody dies without giving
[1:23:04] them a warning. He says there's
[1:23:06] something God tells them, whether it's
[1:23:07] that still small voice, it may just be
[1:23:09] that still small voice and they say,
[1:23:12] "Ah, that ain't nothing. That's just
[1:23:14] me." And that's all the warning they got
[1:23:15] because they didn't listen to that. But
[1:23:18] God never takes a man to judgment before
[1:23:20] warning him first.
[1:23:23] Amen. But headlong the barricades, then
[1:23:26] he goes up. Talk about a red, there's a
[1:23:28] red light here at the city. It turns
[1:23:30] green, turns red, tells you when to
[1:23:32] stop, when to go. And if you run it,
[1:23:35] well, don't blame the
[1:23:39] city. They put the light up there for
[1:23:41] your protection. But if you run through
[1:23:43] it, that's up to you. You have brought
[1:23:45] your own judgment. And if you spurn
[1:23:48] mercy, the only thing that's left,
[1:23:49] that's
[1:23:50] judgment. How many know that there's
[1:23:52] only two choices except the mercy of
[1:23:55] God. Live
[1:23:57] eternally. What a good
[1:24:00] deal. Our God is awesome. Oh, he's
[1:24:05] awesome. Awesome. We can't say awesome
[1:24:08] enough
[1:24:10] that he would do something like
[1:24:17] that. Amen. So he says, listen, if you
[1:24:22] run that lit, don't blame the city. You
[1:24:24] should have stopped. If you wind up in
[1:24:26] hell someday, don't blame God.
[1:24:33] Is that something they're gonna people
[1:24:35] that are in hell, at least if they
[1:24:37] listen to me
[1:24:38] preach, these vo these these words will
[1:24:41] echo in their air. You had the choice.
[1:24:44] It was you. It was you your own self
[1:24:46] that put yourself in hell.
[1:24:50] I can't blame the devil. Well, the devil
[1:24:53] made me do it. No. God made you to vic
[1:24:55] He gave you the victory if you wanted
[1:24:56] it.
[1:24:59] Well, God did. No, God didn't. God did
[1:25:01] everything he could to keep you from it.
[1:25:04] How many knows that's the way it is in
[1:25:06] life? You want to be miserable, go ahead
[1:25:08] and be miserable. But if you want the
[1:25:10] peace of God in your heart,
[1:25:13] sometime people get so miserable in this
[1:25:15] life until they want to kill themselves.
[1:25:18] Why don't they just do what they should
[1:25:19] do and say, "God, I'm going to die to
[1:25:21] myself. help me to accept the way that
[1:25:23] you have made. And then I don't care if
[1:25:26] you're like Paul and man, you're stoned
[1:25:28] and you're you're uh all kinds of
[1:25:30] shipwreck and everything and miserable.
[1:25:32] You still say, "Amen. I thank God I can
[1:25:35] do all things through Christ which
[1:25:36] strengthenth me. I have learned whatever
[1:25:39] state I am in to be content. He was
[1:25:41] happy no matter how much misery there
[1:25:46] was." Decide what world you want to live
[1:25:49] in. How many believes every one of us
[1:25:50] are amateur
[1:25:53] creators? I was on my own at 16 years
[1:25:56] old. I learned a long time ago that you
[1:25:58] got to create your own
[1:26:01] world. Huh? Get out there and do
[1:26:04] something and and and labor with your
[1:26:07] hands. Get you a paycheck and and and
[1:26:10] fend for
[1:26:12] yourself. But I couldn't fend for myself
[1:26:14] when it came to salvation. But when I
[1:26:17] heard the story of Jesus and how he's
[1:26:19] forgiven me, I thank God that he tugged
[1:26:22] on my heart and pulled me and said,
[1:26:24] "Son, where are you? Where are you?" I'm
[1:26:28] so glad I respond and say, "Here I am,
[1:26:30] Lord." Here I am.
[1:26:35] Hallelujah. We're
[1:26:37] creators. Amen. Praise the
[1:26:44] Lord. Don't If you end up in hell
[1:26:47] someday, don't blame God. He's waved
[1:26:51] everything across the front of you that
[1:26:53] he can possibly wave. Even the blood of
[1:26:56] his own
[1:26:59] son. Remember the question brother said
[1:27:01] he's going to ask somebody, everybody
[1:27:03] over there, uh, why why didn't you
[1:27:07] accept
[1:27:09] it? Why did you refuse it?
[1:27:14] He's never going to say like, "Look, I
[1:27:16] didn't do what I was supposed to do, so
[1:27:17] I'm just going to let you on in." God's
[1:27:20] never going to blame
[1:27:21] himself because he did everything he
[1:27:23] possibly could. For all of
[1:27:29] humanity. Think about it. The blood of
[1:27:31] his own son. And you've constantly waved
[1:27:34] right by
[1:27:36] it. Amen. How many knows God, the Holy
[1:27:39] Spirit speaks to our hearts more than we
[1:27:41] realize? He speaks to your heart, but
[1:27:45] you got to be
[1:27:46] listening, listening very intently
[1:27:50] because he does speak to our
[1:27:53] hearts. Amen. So he says constantly just
[1:27:57] the songs in the church, the preaching
[1:28:00] of the gospel, the reading of the word,
[1:28:02] signs and wonders before you, and still
[1:28:05] blindly just determined to go whether
[1:28:08] God stops you or not. God sends nobody
[1:28:12] to hell. You send yourself to hell by
[1:28:15] rejecting his
[1:28:20] son. That's what happens when you refuse
[1:28:23] what God
[1:28:26] done. God's law. You will give account
[1:28:30] for what you've
[1:28:31] done. There's no sherking your
[1:28:36] responsibility. You must answer. So
[1:28:39] let's say, Lord Jesus, I want to answer
[1:28:40] now. You get them preachers to preach
[1:28:44] and just as hard as they can. Whatever
[1:28:48] it is, Lord, that I shouldn't do that
[1:28:50] I'm doing, Lord, help take it away.
[1:28:52] That's what Brother Bam said at the
[1:28:53] beginning. Find out where we are and
[1:28:55] where we should be. That's why we come
[1:28:57] to examine
[1:29:00] ourselves long before we come down to
[1:29:02] the door of death or the rapture. This
[1:29:04] is the time to get
[1:29:05] ready. That's why we come on a Wednesday
[1:29:08] night. Ain't that right? Not just to
[1:29:09] fellowship or just to be here, but we
[1:29:12] come to search
[1:29:13] ourselves, check ourselves, see if we
[1:29:16] are in the faith or not.
[1:29:20] Amen. Amen. You send yourself to hell by
[1:29:24] rejecting his son. God don't send
[1:29:27] anybody to hell for being a sinner. God
[1:29:29] sends you to hell because you won't
[1:29:30] repent and take Christ as your savior.
[1:29:32] You refuse to take the right
[1:29:37] road. You sent yourself to
[1:29:40] torment. You sent your own soul to its
[1:29:44] eternal
[1:29:46] destination upon the free moral agency
[1:29:49] of your convictions. Did you see where I
[1:29:51] get that free moral agency from? That's
[1:29:54] right. He gives people a
[1:29:57] choice. Choose. Make a choice.
[1:30:02] What are you going to
[1:30:03] do? Are you going to serve God or the
[1:30:07] devil? Are you going to listen to that
[1:30:09] still small voice?
[1:30:12] Are you going to accept the
[1:30:15] pardon? You would think that the
[1:30:17] courthouse would be filled, wouldn't
[1:30:18] you?
[1:30:23] But Abraham says,
[1:30:25] "Insanity." The word I don't care is
[1:30:28] insane. It's insane. Ain't that right?
[1:30:31] People that don't care about their souls
[1:30:32] are not
[1:30:33] right. So
[1:30:36] listen, upon the free moral agency of
[1:30:38] your
[1:30:39] convictions, God does not send anybody
[1:30:42] to hell. He never did. He never will.
[1:30:45] Men send themselves to hell because they
[1:30:47] refuse to accept the way of salvation.
[1:30:50] He's longsuffering. He doesn't want any
[1:30:52] to perish. Never wanted it. But men
[1:30:54] would rather walk in darkness than in
[1:30:58] light.
[1:31:00] Remember over the the king uh Aza Aziah.
[1:31:06] Amen. That fell through the lattice went
[1:31:09] to inquire of Beel Zebub. Is there no
[1:31:12] God? And brother Bam says what it was.
[1:31:15] It was his own stubborn
[1:31:18] ways. Now I'll tell you this. Anybody
[1:31:21] that doesn't accept the grace of
[1:31:22] Almighty God, they've got some stubborn
[1:31:24] ways about them. They got selfish ways.
[1:31:27] They want to live their life. They want
[1:31:29] to do their thing. That's right. Say, "I
[1:31:31] want to live my life." Even Jesus said,
[1:31:32] "He that saves his life will lose it."
[1:31:36] But he that loses his life for my sake
[1:31:38] shall preserve it. Find it and preserve
[1:31:43] it. I don't know about you, but that's
[1:31:45] what I'm interested in. Aren't you glad
[1:31:47] that you are interested in preserving
[1:31:49] your life?
[1:31:52] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:59] He's
[1:32:00] long-suffering. Listen, the
[1:32:04] reason they have no desire to take the
[1:32:08] light and messengers come from the east,
[1:32:11] the west, the north, the south. They
[1:32:14] throw barricades, song services,
[1:32:17] testimonies, preaching across the path
[1:32:20] of the sinner. And he deliberately walks
[1:32:22] right through them.
[1:32:25] then say that God is responsible or
[1:32:28] guilty. God is good and full of mercy.
[1:32:31] Listen, God is good and full of mercy.
[1:32:34] And he don't want one to be last lost.
[1:32:37] Listen to this. This is one of those
[1:32:39] things I this is kind of startling. But
[1:32:42] man wants to be
[1:32:46] lost because it's his desire. He refuses
[1:32:49] to walk in the light. Remember places
[1:32:53] the Bible says, "He that hates me love
[1:32:57] death." They love
[1:33:01] death. They don't want to be
[1:33:08] saved. They don't want to be saved
[1:33:12] because guess what? How many knows if
[1:33:14] you want to be saved, you can be. So if
[1:33:17] you don't get saved, you don't want to
[1:33:19] be saved. You want to be lost. If you
[1:33:22] want to be lost, then you want to go to
[1:33:23] hell.
[1:33:26] What a terrible state for the majority
[1:33:30] of the world to be in.
[1:33:33] God help us.
[1:33:36] Amen. See, he refuses to walk in the
[1:33:39] light. You pass by the church. You hear
[1:33:42] the people singing the gospel songs.
[1:33:45] Maybe you really want to go, but you
[1:33:47] light up another cigarette and shake
[1:33:49] your head. What are you trying to do?
[1:33:51] You're fighting your way through every
[1:33:53] barricade. Amen. Every barricade. God
[1:33:57] don't send you to hell. You send
[1:33:58] yourself to hell. Break every barricade.
[1:34:00] Run through every stoplight trying to
[1:34:02] make yourself go to hell. Can you
[1:34:05] imagine knocking down barricades,
[1:34:07] jumping over them, and everything else
[1:34:09] just trying to get there? Aren't that
[1:34:12] grace? God will do anything he possibly
[1:34:14] can to keep you from being lost.
[1:34:20] And here you and I are the bride of
[1:34:22] Jesus Christ who love the Lord with all
[1:34:24] of our heart. We don't serve him because
[1:34:26] we're afraid of being lost. We're
[1:34:28] thankful that we have escaped judgment.
[1:34:31] We are thankful for those things. Those
[1:34:33] are just benefits of knowing a wonderful
[1:34:35] loving savior like Jesus Christ. How did
[1:34:39] he would How many believes that God
[1:34:40] would embrace the whole world?
[1:34:44] Sure he would. He embrace anybody
[1:34:45] that'll come to him, that'll give
[1:34:48] themselves to him, that'll surrender
[1:34:50] themselves to him.
[1:34:54] If you want more of Jesus, there's more
[1:34:56] of Jesus for you to have.
[1:34:59] Amen. But guess what? You're going to
[1:35:01] have to do a little judging. How many
[1:35:02] believes every one of us tonight, if we
[1:35:04] take nothing else away, it's time for
[1:35:06] every one of us to examine ourselves.
[1:35:09] Ain't that right? Look at the fruits
[1:35:11] that you're bearing. Look at look at the
[1:35:12] way you're living. Yeah. Look at uh your
[1:35:17] attitude towards other people. What kind
[1:35:20] of home life you have, what kind of
[1:35:22] relationship you have with your
[1:35:24] mate, what kind of demeanor, what kind
[1:35:27] of atmosphere that you have. Search
[1:35:30] yourself. Judge
[1:35:35] yourself. Amen. Because you are the
[1:35:38] judge in this courthouse.
[1:35:40] Amen. And if you refuse, judge yourself
[1:35:43] unworthy over on that day, he will play
[1:35:46] that back. Right? Here's where you
[1:35:48] decided you didn't want it. Ain't that
[1:35:51] right? He'll be He'll be your judge
[1:35:54] then. He will. But you are your judge
[1:35:57] now of where you go. And God has put
[1:36:00] that on all of humanity. God bless you.
[1:36:03] Let's stand tonight. Kind of a sobering
[1:36:06] kind of thought, isn't it? But it really
[1:36:08] is because I don't know about you
[1:36:09] because I feel I feel bad for people
[1:36:13] that don't know Jesus Christ. I do
[1:36:16] anything. Amen. Sometimes we get a
[1:36:19] little bold like Paul and and stuff with
[1:36:22] people and say, "Hey, you know, you
[1:36:24] can't keep going that way. You know that
[1:36:25] ain't
[1:36:27] right." Huh? Why? Because you realize
[1:36:29] that up ahead there's a fall.
[1:36:33] Then better bam sand. You say, "Hey,
[1:36:35] that bone to go over to Niagara. It
[1:36:37] ain't going to stand it. You better get
[1:36:40] that motor and come over this
[1:36:42] way." Oh, shut up, you holy
[1:36:45] roller.
[1:36:48] Amen. I won't read you the story. I have
[1:36:51] it here. Remember the one little lady
[1:36:53] that brother Ram talked about how that
[1:36:55] he had a a young lady that wore her
[1:36:58] hair, I guess, and she would just slick
[1:36:59] her hair back and really looked really
[1:37:02] holiness and dressed modest and
[1:37:03] everything else. And this other one, you
[1:37:05] know, how that she uh she man, she was
[1:37:07] all modern everything else and and ended
[1:37:10] up with uh uh uh sexual
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:14] disease and thought, you know, the
[1:37:16] preacher said, "Ah, it doesn't matter if
[1:37:18] you dress like this or that don't
[1:37:19] matter, this that don't matter. It is
[1:37:20] all of these other when you come down to
[1:37:22] dying come down to the door of death had
[1:37:25] the preacher there out there smoking
[1:37:27] maybe in the hallway smoking a cigarette
[1:37:28] and everything else and all of a sudden
[1:37:30] she says because she thought she was
[1:37:32] right she oh I'm fine I'm she says I'm
[1:37:35] lost I'm lost and the preacher oh be
[1:37:39] quiet you know you're saved you know
[1:37:41] you're all right she said you
[1:37:44] deceiver telling everybody this is okay
[1:37:47] that's okay but Abraham says on the day
[1:37:50] of judgment. That preacher is going to
[1:37:51] give an answer.
[1:37:53] He'll have to give an answer for not
[1:37:56] warning to people, for not telling the
[1:37:58] truth.
[1:38:00] Instead, call that girl. Get that girl
[1:38:02] to come and pray for
[1:38:04] me. Huh? Don't never be ashamed of
[1:38:08] looking modest and holy and righteous.
[1:38:11] Don't never be ashamed of it.
[1:38:14] Amen. He said the girl didn't make it in
[1:38:16] time. She was gone.
[1:38:19] But she realized at that time that she
[1:38:21] all of that
[1:38:24] wishy-washy
[1:38:25] laxidasical
[1:38:27] lukewarm anything goes religion doesn't
[1:38:30] make it.
[1:38:32] Amen. I'm going to say Lord show me any
[1:38:35] bad place that I have. Show me my bad
[1:38:38] places. Lord I want to be pleasing
[1:38:40] because we that's what what we want is
[1:38:42] Lord Jesus let me be pleasing to you
[1:38:45] Lord. Lord Jesus you see the hands all
[1:38:47] over the building. Father, show
[1:38:50] us, Lord. We don't want to make excuses.
[1:38:55] We don't want to shun it away from our
[1:38:58] conscience. Sherk it away, Lord. If you
[1:39:03] want to speak to our hearts, speak,
[1:39:05] Lord. If you want to condemn us for
[1:39:08] things we're doing wrong, condemn us. We
[1:39:09] want it now. We want it straightened out
[1:39:11] now. We want to repent now while there's
[1:39:14] mercy. while there's a tub of bleach.
[1:39:17] While you're saying, "Right over here
[1:39:19] after you're condemned and sure you're
[1:39:21] wrong. Right over here is Jesus sitting
[1:39:23] on the mercy seat. If you'll go over
[1:39:25] there, he'll give you a
[1:39:29] pardon and he will wipe your slate
[1:39:33] clean. He will justify you as though you
[1:39:37] never done any of it in the first
[1:39:40] place. It's a
[1:39:42] blanket pardon.
[1:39:45] if you'll just receive it. And Lord,
[1:39:48] that's what we're doing. Raising our
[1:39:49] hands and saying, "Lord Jesus, we
[1:39:51] receive a pardon. We receive, Lord, the
[1:39:54] forgiveness for our wrongs, our
[1:39:57] shortcomings, and where we're not what
[1:39:58] we ought to be, Lord." Not praying like
[1:40:01] we should, Lord. Whatever it is, each
[1:40:03] individual this morning or this evening,
[1:40:06] looking into their own heart, seeing
[1:40:08] where they are, not what they ought to
[1:40:10] be, and saying, "God, make me more like
[1:40:12] you." cuz we've got one interest and
[1:40:15] that is like pet pee Paul I mean Peter
[1:40:17] said that we may be found of him without
[1:40:20] spot wrinkles blemish or any such thing
[1:40:22] Lord that's our heart's desire every day
[1:40:25] we say God forgive me of my shortcomings
