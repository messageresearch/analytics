[20:23] kind of heavenly father we come before
[20:25] you lord jesus once again
[20:26] lord getting away from our jobs and our
[20:29] work lord and
[20:30] lord all the stress of life father just

[20:34] in oasis with you lord and center our
[20:37] minds on your word and to worship you in
[20:39] spirit and in truth
[20:41] with lord we ask god tonight you would
[20:44] just help us lord jesus once again
[20:47] lord to lift up your name to glorify you
[20:49] to bring honor and glory to your name
[20:50] lord and
[20:51] father that we would have worshipped
[20:53] lord jesus that lord that you could love
[20:55] and that you could appreciate father
[20:57] we ask god you'll bless the meditation
[20:59] of our heart bless your reading of your
[21:00] word lord and
[21:02] we ask god you'd help me just to get out
[21:03] of the way that you might use me father
[21:05] for your honor for your glory lord
[21:08] you know all the needs that's
[21:09] represented lord jesus we just lift them
[21:11] all up before you
[21:12] father desire god that you'll have your
[21:14] perfect way in our life lord
[21:16] we ask these blessings and favors in
[21:18] jesus christ's name
[21:20] amen and amen amen so
[21:24] amen this is going to be perhaps just a
[21:27] little
[21:28] different tonight but i was just praying
[21:31] about what to speak on this
[21:33] you know i thought about sunday of what
[21:35] we had talked about
[21:36] walking with the lord and how our walk
[21:39] ought to be and
[21:40] how we ought to be ready at all times
[21:42] for his coming amen
[21:44] and so tonight i'm going to call
[21:46] expressions of our walk with the lord
[21:49] expressions of our walk with the lord
[21:53] and i want to ask this question if
[21:55] somebody would ask you
[21:58] somebody would ask you the question and
[22:00] after tonight i hope that you'll be able
[22:02] to have an answer
[22:03] amen it would ask you what is it like
[22:08] to be a christian what's it like
[22:12] can you explain to me what is it like to
[22:15] be a christian
[22:16] amen so that's going to be the question
[22:18] that we ask ourselves
[22:20] and y'all take some time and just take a
[22:22] few moments and
[22:23] think about that now we'll take
[22:25] questions or means perhaps put it before
[22:27] some of us if you have something that
[22:28] you'd like to share
[22:30] and say well this is what it's like
[22:33] like for me brother i mean this is kind
[22:34] of what it's like and
[22:36] of course i've got several things wrote
[22:37] down that's because i had plenty of time
[22:39] to think about what to write down
[22:41] but any kind of illustration let's say a
[22:43] bible
[22:46] reference a bible parable
[22:49] a story that brother branham told
[22:52] anything that would express what it's
[22:54] like
[22:55] to know the lord have come to the lord
[22:59] and what you walk with the lord is like
[23:01] amen so that if a sinner asks you
[23:04] well what's it like to be a christian
[23:06] you could be able to give them an answer
[23:08] amen
[23:09] is that okay tonight we do it that way i
[23:12] like
[23:12] i like participation amen i think it
[23:15] gets you on edge and
[23:17] just going to get you on your toes a
[23:19] little bit when i ask you a question or
[23:21] whatever and
[23:22] i mean it kind of challenge you a little
[23:23] bit amen because amen i think it's good
[23:26] for us amen so
[23:27] god bless you let's just read the word
[23:29] tonight colossians if you will
[23:44] like i said just uh just
[23:48] expressions stories parables something
[23:51] you might say
[23:52] about what it's like to walk with the
[23:54] lord and to have fellowship with him
[23:58] amen colossians 2
[24:01] and verse 12.
[24:08] we are buried with him in baptism
[24:11] wherein also ye are risen with him
[24:14] through the faith of the operation of
[24:16] god who hath raised him
[24:18] from the dead now i'm going to read go
[24:20] ahead and read chapter 3 also
[24:22] chapter 3 of colossians 1 through 3
[24:26] 1-4 yeah three
[24:29] if you then be risen with christ seek
[24:31] those things which are above where
[24:33] christ sitteth on the right hand of god
[24:35] set your affections on things above and
[24:38] not on things
[24:39] on earth for ye are dead and your life
[24:42] is hit with
[24:43] with your life is hid with christ
[24:47] in god amen may god had his blessings to
[24:50] the reading of the word
[24:52] you can be seated amen let me just say
[24:55] this i'm going to start off okay i'm
[24:57] going to start off by saying this if
[24:58] someone was to ask me
[25:00] what is it like to be a christian amen
[25:03] the first thing i would say probably is
[25:06] that
[25:07] it's like having died
[25:10] and then rose again amen
[25:14] when i died the old man died
[25:17] and there was a new man that was born
[25:20] old things passed away all
[25:24] things became new
[25:27] how many believes that amen all of a
[25:30] sudden we had our affections on the
[25:31] things of the world
[25:33] and the earth but all of a sudden it's
[25:35] changed now and now i've set my
[25:37] affections on things above
[25:40] and not on things below sure we got to
[25:42] take care of ourselves
[25:43] or we gotta buy for our home and our
[25:45] family that's bible isn't that right
[25:48] but your main affection your main
[25:50] objective
[25:51] is that you amen
[25:54] i have your affections on things above
[25:57] and
[25:57] you are dead notice verse 3 verse
[26:01] chapter 3 verse 3 for ye are
[26:04] dead and your life is hid with christ in
[26:07] god
[26:07] amen so we know that when we come forth
[26:11] we put on a new man so it's all new
[26:14] completely changed so
[26:18] you know for some of us especially
[26:20] probably i think brother david's
[26:21] mentioned it that you know
[26:23] when he was a sinner he was just a
[26:24] different man
[26:26] you know and no doubt that was probably
[26:29] for a lot of us whenever you were not
[26:31] born again
[26:32] you were a different person you were
[26:34] different than what you are because god
[26:36] changed you
[26:38] amen question has got somebody's
[26:41] got an illustration or something you'd
[26:43] like to say this is what it's like for
[26:45] me
[26:46] to live every day christian life
[26:51] you have a type parable or anything
[26:55] but it's to eat
[27:13] amen i like that that's good
[27:17] that's right does anybody have a story
[27:20] that you could think of perhaps brother
[27:21] ramsey along with that
[27:27] no all right i've got one for you is
[27:28] that okay because this is one of the
[27:30] things i had wrote down
[27:32] you know and that is having a guide
[27:36] is that right i'm just glad to have a
[27:38] guy
[27:40] i mean somebody that'll direct you the
[27:43] right way
[27:44] now brother was a christian he was born
[27:46] again he was god's prophet but yet he
[27:48] got up in those mountains isn't that
[27:50] right
[27:51] and he thought he could find his way now
[27:54] right
[27:55] and he got the storming and snowing and
[27:58] he went
[27:59] killed his animals and hung them up on a
[28:01] tree
[28:03] right and he went straight he was going
[28:06] back the way he was supposed to be and
[28:07] all of a sudden he comes around and
[28:08] there's his animals hanging right there
[28:12] huh he was right back there he was
[28:14] called the death walk
[28:17] amen that's what i tell people is i was
[28:20] on the death law
[28:22] i was gonna die i was lost
[28:28] huh and he says now i know i'm a guide i
[28:31] know my way and everything else
[28:34] and wasn't he going to try it about the
[28:35] third time
[28:37] he was going to try it about the third
[28:38] time he said i'm going to blame my i'm
[28:40] going to do this
[28:41] and he was heading out isn't that right
[28:43] he was heading out and what happened
[28:46] somebody touched him on the shoulder
[28:49] huh that's thing that gives you
[28:52] direction
[28:55] that's what a christian has without god
[29:00] you see out there what happens without
[29:01] direction they don't know what they're
[29:03] going to do next
[29:05] they don't know what they're going to
[29:06] become next they don't know what they're
[29:08] going to look like next
[29:09] they don't know what they're going to do
[29:10] with their hair next they don't know
[29:12] what they're going to do with their skin
[29:13] next
[29:13] they don't know what they're going to do
[29:14] with their wife their husband their
[29:16] family or their kids next
[29:18] no direction but thank god for the tap
[29:22] it means you got somebody that's help
[29:24] going to help you and
[29:26] guide you and help you to find your
[29:29] way because in this world we need to
[29:33] find our way
[29:35] and you can't find it by yourself how
[29:38] many knows the story but
[29:39] i'm saying out west to those mountains
[29:41] so forth you can't even go hunting by
[29:43] yourself
[29:45] they won't let you without what
[29:49] a guide
[29:52] amen so praise the lord you
[29:56] once without a guide and now you have a
[29:58] guide
[30:00] amen and what did he do he miraculously
[30:03] opened up through the fog
[30:05] and everything else so that he could see
[30:07] a certain place
[30:08] and he could see a tower i believe it
[30:10] was right
[30:12] because he knew if he could get to that
[30:13] tower there is a line that they had
[30:16] pulled
[30:16] and all you got to do is grab ahold of
[30:18] that line
[30:20] and you'll find your way back down to
[30:22] the cabin
[30:23] where i believe his wife and his child
[30:25] was and he even said they would perish
[30:28] unless he got got help him
[30:31] so his whole family was gone without the
[30:33] lifeline that's what it's like
[30:35] to be a christian you have somebody to
[30:37] help you
[30:38] find a lifeline and we get that in a lot
[30:42] of times in our lives
[30:44] all through our christian walk we come
[30:46] to places to where you know you need
[30:48] direction
[30:49] you need god to come supernaturally and
[30:52] help you
[30:54] praise be to god i'm going to explain
[30:56] after that
[30:58] hallelujah amen
[31:02] anybody can think of anything else that
[31:04] what's it like to be a christian because
[31:05] remember
[31:07] it's what you live like it's what you
[31:09] experience
[31:11] every day isn't it our walk with our god
[31:15] is what we experience
[31:16] every day what's it like so i ask you
[31:20] what's it like to be a christian
[31:23] and having found god and to walk with
[31:26] god
[31:29] anybody got anything but a bread
[31:44] whatever
[31:55] what will god
[32:26] 365
[32:32] amen i like that security
[32:37] amen how many knows we just read that
[32:40] scripture about your life is hid
[32:42] it'll hid in christ you don't have to be
[32:46] scared
[32:48] amen
[32:51] i like and let me say this first of all
[32:55] is that when you get into christ there's
[32:58] there's an atmosphere it knows it's an
[33:00] atmosphere
[33:02] and in that atmosphere
[33:06] in the atmosphere of the holy spirit
[33:08] people have wrote
[33:11] almost every song all right
[33:15] comes by what inspiration
[33:18] so if you really want to now i've got
[33:20] things wrote down here
[33:21] if you really want to express there's a
[33:23] lot of people that express
[33:25] what it's like to walk with god
[33:29] in song
[33:32] in song and i could think one of the
[33:36] things that one song that i could think
[33:37] of
[33:38] that would express what brother brad was
[33:39] saying is the song
[33:41] that people wrote about leaning on jesus
[33:46] amen leaning on jesus
[33:49] leaning on jesus safe and secure from
[33:53] all alarm i'm lit hello
[33:57] walking with the lord puts a song in
[34:00] your heart
[34:04] how many believes that we ought to have
[34:06] a song
[34:07] it puts a song in our heart
[34:10] when uh uh fanny
[34:15] what was her name fanny
[34:22] crosby all right it's hard to hear four
[34:25] voices and brother
[34:26] figure out what was said fanny crosby
[34:29] that's right
[34:30] when she was asking oh look you're blind
[34:32] you can't see and
[34:34] how are you gonna know him over there
[34:36] how many know she had such a peace
[34:39] such a comfort in her heart that she
[34:40] wrote a song about it
[34:42] that right she goes oh i shall know him
[34:46] i shall know
[34:48] him she expressed it in the song
[34:52] her comeback was in the form of the
[34:54] psalm
[34:56] i shall know him by the prince of the
[34:59] nails
[35:00] in his hand praise the lord
[35:04] i'll say a little more tower said if
[35:06] that's okay because i got it wrote down
[35:08] it's like being shut in with god it's
[35:10] like being
[35:11] behind the inner veil
[35:15] i mean believes that's where we need to
[35:16] be i'm here to tell you right now this
[35:18] message is to take us
[35:20] not in the first court or the second
[35:22] court because there you worry about
[35:24] everything
[35:26] you're affected by the weather you know
[35:28] what the prophet of god said
[35:29] when things are going good oh you're
[35:30] happy but boyfriend things are going bad
[35:32] you're just
[35:33] all down in the dumps but he says and
[35:36] you meet these people and then what
[35:37] other people
[35:39] you know that are just up one day and
[35:41] down the other in one day and doubt the
[35:43] other you know
[35:44] they've come to church and so forth
[35:46] they're justified perhaps
[35:47] perhaps even sanctified but they need a
[35:50] trip
[35:50] in behind the veil
[35:53] that's what it's like it's being shut in
[35:56] somewhere
[35:57] when all on the outside there's just all
[35:59] kinds of noise and all kinds of
[36:01] craziness going on
[36:03] but you shut in with god and you
[36:06] are it's sound proof as he said you
[36:09] don't hear all those things
[36:11] because if you're listening to all that
[36:13] mess and you're hearing it how many
[36:15] knows
[36:16] it's going to affect you it is going
[36:19] to affect you that's why you're going to
[36:21] be shut in with god
[36:24] amen in a secret place
[36:27] how many knows they expressed it also in
[36:29] that song shut in with god in the secret
[36:32] place

[41:16] upon all your cares upon
[41:20] him for he careth for you that's what
[41:23] it's like
[41:24] to be a christian amen brother john
[41:28] coming

[41:31] questions of
[41:32] what it's like to walk with the lord
[41:35] what it's like to be a christian if

[41:50] don't know what you're missing
[41:52] is that right it's the best thing in the
[41:55] world
[41:56] it's the only way i was listening to
[41:58] tape in 58 brother brandon was talking
[42:00] about
[42:01] he says oh i just don't know what i
[42:03] would do if
[42:04] i was a christian he said i would
[42:06] probably be a suicide case
[42:09] that's what he said i'd probably be a
[42:10] suicide case if i couldn't be a
[42:12] christian
[42:14] why you pull your hair out you'd worry
[42:16] fret
[42:17] amen praise be to god
[42:24] anybody else has anything that they i've
[42:26] got things wrote down here we'll just if
[42:28] you mention it
[42:29] we'll pick it up and mention it if not
[42:30] i'll i'll speak on it a little bit
[42:33] anybody else tell me what is it like to
[42:35] be a christian
[42:38] what is it like to walk with the lord
[42:49] amen comfort
[42:52] and peace i like that answer
[42:56] you have no idea what kind of comfort it
[42:59] is to be a christian and to walk with
[43:00] the lord
[43:02] and it is a peace that what
[43:06] passes understanding that's what it's
[43:09] like to be a christian
[43:10] it's a peace that passes understanding
[43:13] down in my heart
[43:15] down in my heart it says amen i've got
[43:18] the peace that passes
[43:20] understanding down in my heart where
[43:24] how long to stay
[43:28] see almost every aspect of our walk with
[43:31] god
[43:31] is written in song
[43:35] almost every aspect there's hardly any
[43:37] subject that you can't find
[43:40] amen i don't care if it's job or if it's
[43:42] a man that lost his wife and child
[43:44] in the ocean and they drowned it went
[43:47] down with the ship
[43:48] and he comes with another ship and sails
[43:50] right over top of that spot
[43:54] and you ask him what do you have to say
[43:58] when peace like a river attendeth my way
[44:03] when sorrows like sea belows roll
[44:05] whatever my lot i have
[44:08] learned he has taught me to say
[44:12] it is well with my soul
[44:16] so you tell us you know you tell
[44:18] somebody to ask you it doesn't matter
[44:20] what the situation is the great part of
[44:22] it
[44:23] is if you get in a bad place you have
[44:26] somebody
[44:26] that'll get you out if you get in a bad
[44:30] situation
[44:30] he will carry you through
[44:33] you don't have to put a gun to your head
[44:35] and shoot yourself
[44:37] amen praise be to god i like that
[44:41] very two things i've got wrote right
[44:43] down here
[44:44] it's uh peace that passes understanding
[44:47] what was the other one
[44:51] joy unspeakable and full of glory
[44:54] that's what it's like to be a christian
[44:58] and to walk god and remember as we go
[45:00] through these things
[45:05] because i don't know about you but i'm
[45:06] sure that even sunday with the altar
[45:09] we all want to attain to that walk with
[45:12] god that we're supposed to have
[45:14] isn't that right and as we go through
[45:16] these things can you see
[45:18] yeah i've got that peace that passes
[45:20] i've got that joy unspeakable and full
[45:22] of glory
[45:22] i do put my trust in god no matter what
[45:24] happens no matter what comes our way
[45:26] i'm not going to worry about it get gray
[45:28] hair
[45:30] huh
[45:33] because it's a devil business devil's
[45:35] business to make you mad about something
[45:40] to get you upset about something upset
[45:43] is upset let's not get upset let's stay
[45:46] upright
[45:47] is that right and that's some of the
[45:49] hardest things that we'll do
[45:51] sometimes it takes until you get as gray
[45:54] as i am before you learn it
[45:58] to not get upset about things just to
[46:01] commit it to god getting upset about it
[46:04] isn't going to do any good
[46:06] and sometimes that's hard on the flesh
[46:08] it takes prayer
[46:09] and it came to commit almighty god
[46:12] praise the lord anybody else
[46:23] yes brother
[46:54] is
[47:22] before
[48:32] what

[51:12] christian and it's so important

[51:16] your workers and those around you then
[51:18] you know because that's where your light

[51:38] taking care of you and that's good
[51:39] that's uh you can just rest assured amen
[51:43] i like that amen praise the lord
[51:48] anybody else

[51:58] do amen
[52:00] god bless you brother david
[52:08] [Music]
[52:14] amen that's good that's a that's a good
[52:17] example
[52:18] right there amen
[52:21] i mean another one that we could say and
[52:23] that is it's like having
[52:25] a found that we found the pearl of great
[52:28] price
[52:29] isn't that right and it costs you
[52:31] everything to get that pearl
[52:34] amen and you're broke now when somebody
[52:37] tries to sell you something else
[52:39] well you ought to be the muhammad or
[52:41] this out of the other that's it
[52:42] i'm flat broke sir i can't afford
[52:44] anymore
[52:45] i put all my money in the pearl of great
[52:48] price
[52:49] amen and it is absolutely
[52:52] awesome just to be a christian amen i
[52:54] found that great pearl
[52:56] that most greatest treasure that a
[52:59] person
[53:00] can find by god's grace
[53:03] that's what it's like amen
[53:08] anybody else
[53:40] um
[53:55] amen yes amen that's right
[54:00] amen he teaches us along the way don't
[54:02] he
[54:04] one thing i've got wrote down here it's
[54:05] like going to
[54:07] it's like going to school christianity
[54:10] once you become a christian it's like
[54:11] going to school
[54:12] god has to take you to first grade he
[54:14] has to take his second grade
[54:16] he's got to teach you everything yet you
[54:19] know what brother brahm said the
[54:20] pentecostal thought they had arrived
[54:21] when they got the holy ghost
[54:23] that was just the beginning amen it's
[54:25] like having a tutor
[54:27] to teach you things amen and he's trying
[54:30] to get us to the place
[54:32] just like you go to school perhaps even
[54:34] go to college
[54:35] so that you can be ready to what face
[54:38] the world they call it
[54:39] right ready to face the world
[54:43] you're ready well that's what god's
[54:45] trying to get us
[54:46] is to ready to face the new world not
[54:49] this world
[54:50] but get us ready for that world amen
[54:53] again trying to get us a place
[54:55] of graduation a place to where we're
[54:57] ready for the new world
[54:59] but it is a process isn't it he teaches
[55:02] us many things
[55:04] it's just not all peace and comfort
[55:07] it isn't here but the lessons we go
[55:10] through are not always peace and comfort
[55:12] but if you can learn just to commit it
[55:14] all to god and learn
[55:16] learn your lessons like you should and
[55:19] mature
[55:21] amen i'm glad that whenever you pass the
[55:24] tests
[55:25] god doesn't make you take it over again
[55:27] amen not always
[55:29] the same amen so praise god brother joe
[55:32] i appreciate that about
[55:33] amen you know a lot of us could probably
[55:36] say that if god can help me
[55:38] he can help anybody amen
[55:42] pray or like amen so i like to
[55:45] appreciate y'all's testimony
[55:46] what is it like to be a christian what
[55:49] would you say does anybody else have
[55:51] anything that comes to
[55:52] mind
[55:58] well it's like a bird and it's like
[56:01] being a rabbit
[56:03] i got two of them
[56:06] it's kind of like being a bird
[56:09] all right the bible says behold the
[56:12] fowls of the air
[56:13] am i right they don't gather in the
[56:16] barns in the winter
[56:19] they aren't already they live just one
[56:21] day at a time
[56:23] they don't know where the next meal is
[56:24] going to come from
[56:26] isn't that right but there's somebody
[56:29] that supplies
[56:31] for them i mean believe we got a
[56:33] supplier if you're a christian
[56:35] you have a supplier you have somebody
[56:39] that watches over you
[56:41] amen a lot of times as you are young
[56:44] sometimes and
[56:45] maybe you overspend or you get in a
[56:47] tight place you can't make your truck
[56:49] payment or
[56:50] your insurance payment on the truck and
[56:52] there's your boss so there's your
[56:53] brother there's your family there's
[56:55] somebody you can lean to and say hey can
[56:57] you help me out a little
[56:59] is that right somebody that helps you
[57:01] that's what god is he's somebody
[57:03] that helps you and watches out for you
[57:06] amen
[57:07] so it's like being a bird amen god
[57:10] cares about the foul of the air he
[57:13] certainly cares for you
[57:15] for you're worth a whole lot more than
[57:16] the bird
[57:18] amen so we thank god for being a
[57:21] supplier when you're a christian
[57:22] it means you have somebody that knows
[57:25] what you have need of
[57:26] and he has somebody there and meant to
[57:29] take care of you
[57:31] amen someone used to break down like
[57:33] sister parrish
[57:34] put that seat back and say lord i need
[57:37] to talk to you here
[57:38] am that right help me send somebody my
[57:42] way i need to help just
[57:44] be patient you know right i hope it's
[57:46] not too long
[57:47] get run get out of gas and get all hot
[57:49] or something
[57:51] but you learn to trust in god into
[57:54] little things
[57:55] amen praise be to god
[57:59] amen well i'll tell you what maybe i'll
[58:02] just share a little testimony too
[58:04] hey my son used donna's bug to go down
[58:08] to uncle ease when he got down there
[58:10] aiming that bug quit on him just squid
[58:13] on him wouldn't run anymore
[58:15] i was like well what am i going to do
[58:18] what am i going to do
[58:20] and so of course i called brother david
[58:23] i thought maybe he'd have a
[58:24] uh a trailer that i could take and hook
[58:27] up and go down there and load it up
[58:30] and so you know try i've thought about
[58:32] my trailers but they are
[58:33] like that a bug's not gonna go up over
[58:36] that
[58:37] and so i called him he says well your
[58:39] truck ain't gonna pull that i said well

[58:50] and you know he went down there and took
[58:52] care of it all

[58:58] relaxing lord takes care of things isn't
[59:00] that right
[59:01] or your brother does so praise god amen
[59:04] so now let's just pray it isn't big
[59:08] i hope it's just a battery in the little
[59:10] key you know or something like that
[59:13] but we just leave it in the lord's hand
[59:15] isn't that right
[59:16] praise be to god all right anyone else

[1:01:10] yeah that's good i appreciate that i
[1:01:14] just listened to that story yesterday
[1:01:16] i heard him talking about that story
[1:01:18] about memphis an ignorant woman that
[1:01:20] god honored her so much until he stopped
[1:01:23] the plane
[1:01:25] and a year later that boy says hey
[1:01:27] parson
[1:01:28] you don't know who i am amen i'm a
[1:01:30] christian now
[1:01:32] amen what it is like to be a christian
[1:01:35] praise be to god i'll say this you know
[1:01:39] remember the story of the two women that
[1:01:42] went through the prayer line one was for
[1:01:44] something in her throat i think it was
[1:01:46] in her stomach and she kept testifying i
[1:01:49] believe the gods healed me and
[1:01:50] her husband finally told her you know
[1:01:52] you're bringing a reproach
[1:01:54] you know you're not really healed you're
[1:01:56] saying you are and you're just hanging
[1:01:57] on
[1:01:58] same way with john ryan and so forth
[1:02:00] sometimes that's what faith is all about
[1:02:02] just confess it and keep believing it
[1:02:04] doesn't matter what it is and i'll say
[1:02:07] this i believe you got to have that same
[1:02:09] patience with a sinner or somebody
[1:02:11] that's trying to do right
[1:02:13] and don't seem to be able to get it
[1:02:15] right keep having confidence keep
[1:02:17] praying
[1:02:17] keep believing god will come on the
[1:02:19] scene sooner or later
[1:02:21] amen i believe that's the way god is
[1:02:23] don't you
[1:02:24] and that's the way we need to be as a
[1:02:25] very very patient
[1:02:27] long-suffering with people amen and
[1:02:30] outside of blasphemy the holy ghost you
[1:02:33] know
[1:02:34] god will forgive all sin
[1:02:37] amen i heard brother brahm say that god
[1:02:39] even forgives murder
[1:02:42] even forgives murder so you ain't
[1:02:46] murdered nobody yet hopefully
[1:02:49] no i don't mean yet or ever will
[1:02:53] but david you know david he was guilty
[1:02:55] of murder

[1:05:34] amen and he'll slay him amen
[1:05:37] praise the lord the host rise against me
[1:05:40] praise be to god
[1:05:43] how about pressure a pressure release
[1:05:47] when you come to christ because i don't
[1:05:50] care what human it is how many knows god
[1:05:52] has put a
[1:05:53] religion a thirst in every everybody
[1:05:56] you find the africans american indians
[1:05:58] they're all religious
[1:05:59] god has put that in them to know that
[1:06:01] there's a god somewhere
[1:06:04] amen and that they're all guilty they're
[1:06:07] all sinful
[1:06:09] but god has given us a release from that
[1:06:12] scare that fear i put down here
[1:06:16] the prophet talked about how did it's
[1:06:18] like a rabbit that is running from a
[1:06:20] wolf
[1:06:21] and he's scared to death he's worried
[1:06:23] he's under a lot of pressure
[1:06:26] vixen leaves his life but if you can
[1:06:28] just get
[1:06:30] to that rock pile if you can get just
[1:06:32] get
[1:06:33] to that hole in the rock you'll be safe
[1:06:38] that's what it's like when you found
[1:06:40] christ when christ saved you
[1:06:43] amen it was like coming into that place
[1:06:45] of refuge
[1:06:47] amen and they wrote a song god is my
[1:06:49] refuge
[1:06:51] amen i'm strong my strong and mighty
[1:06:54] that i can run into how many is glad for
[1:06:57] a refuge
[1:06:58] there's just we could go all night till
[1:07:00] tomorrow morning probably
[1:07:02] just talking about all the different
[1:07:03] things it is and what it means
[1:07:06] to be a christian amen
[1:07:09] it's glorious praise be to god
[1:07:14] another one i've got wrote down here
[1:07:17] it's like being on a ship
[1:07:21] on a great big ship on the ocean and
[1:07:23] there's
[1:07:24] comes a storm that could tilt that
[1:07:30] ship sideways that could sink that
[1:07:33] but if that ship will take and put its
[1:07:35] anchor out
[1:07:37] and grip on a rock down there it'll hold
[1:07:40] it steady
[1:07:41] no matter how many waves come beat
[1:07:43] against us go over top
[1:07:44] underneath that ship is safe
[1:07:48] it's anchored it's got a anger that's
[1:07:51] the way it is to be a christian is
[1:07:53] you're not tossed on life's boundless
[1:07:56] ocean
[1:07:57] anymore but you've got to anchor in your
[1:07:59] heart now
[1:08:01] amen i thank god for the anchor
[1:08:04] at 20 years old it's when god saved me
[1:08:08] when i got that anchor
[1:08:09] and it gripped that rock oh we've had
[1:08:12] some storms
[1:08:14] every kind of storm you can imagine all
[1:08:16] kinds of waves
[1:08:18] all kinds of things that's come along
[1:08:21] but if that anchor
[1:08:22] grips and holds that solid rock
[1:08:26] you don't have to fear you don't have to
[1:08:29] be afraid
[1:08:30] amen praise the lord
[1:08:34] like the song says i was sinking deep in
[1:08:37] sin
[1:08:37] far from the peaceful shore very deeply
[1:08:40] stained within
[1:08:41] sinking to rise no more but the master
[1:08:45] of the sea heard my despairing cry
[1:08:47] and from the waters lifted me now
[1:08:51] safe am i love
[1:08:54] lifted me amen
[1:08:57] another one is amen
[1:09:01] my heart was distressed beneath
[1:09:03] jehovah's grit
[1:09:04] frown and low in the pit where my sins
[1:09:08] dragged me down
[1:09:09] amen but he brought me out of the miry
[1:09:12] clay
[1:09:13] set my feet upon the rock to stay
[1:09:17] amen how many thankful for that that's
[1:09:19] what it means
[1:09:21] you were strifting on lysosome fixing
[1:09:24] the sink
[1:09:26] fixing to die but then he lifted you up
[1:09:30] and let you know that even though you
[1:09:32] draw your last breath
[1:09:34] that's not the end you don't have to
[1:09:35] even fear that
[1:09:37] it's just going from this place to that
[1:09:39] dimension
[1:09:40] amen i'm thankful for that
[1:09:43] praise the lord it's like the little
[1:09:47] black woman
[1:09:49] amen that was the cook for some timber
[1:09:52] cutters way out in the
[1:09:53] timbers if you remember in the one boy
[1:09:55] that came in he was trying to get a job
[1:09:58] just to hold him over a wanderer and he
[1:10:00] went in there
[1:10:01] and they gave him a job with this black
[1:10:03] woman i believe it was to cook
[1:10:05] and that night a storm came up a twister
[1:10:08] the trees were snapping
[1:10:11] and that woman was over there just
[1:10:12] singing the melodies and the praises of
[1:10:14] god she wasn't afraid
[1:10:16] amen and jesus said can i come over
[1:10:18] there and he went over there
[1:10:20] are you right with god no no he says
[1:10:23] well you better pray
[1:10:24] pray down he says later he says you know
[1:10:26] i was too scared to pray
[1:10:29] the only thing he said he said i all i
[1:10:31] could say was god
[1:10:32] if you'll get me out of this i promise
[1:10:35] yeah
[1:10:36] i'll address this here under better
[1:10:38] conditions and i believe it was in one
[1:10:40] of brother venom's meetings i believe it
[1:10:41] was
[1:10:42] that he addressed the situation and he
[1:10:44] wanted to get things settled
[1:10:46] amen with god and he got that anchor
[1:10:51] we will have that anchor that that woman
[1:10:53] have that though the trees are snapping
[1:10:55] though the tornadoes are coming you do
[1:10:57] not have to fear you don't have to be
[1:10:59] afraid
[1:11:00] because you know what god has got his
[1:11:03] hand on you
[1:11:04] i'm just glad that god's got his hand on
[1:11:06] you i'm glad to be a christian
[1:11:08] praise be to god i am thankful to be a
[1:11:11] christian
[1:11:12] that's some of the things that it means
[1:11:15] to be a christian
[1:11:16] i wrote down here i'm going to cut the
[1:11:18] service short so that maybe we can sing
[1:11:20] a few of these songs
[1:11:22] because how many believe that god is in
[1:11:23] songs god is in our worship
[1:11:26] and when we worship i want to encourage
[1:11:28] every one of us
[1:11:29] when we worship let's just close our
[1:11:30] eyes and just amen just
[1:11:33] think about him and think about the
[1:11:36] words that we're singing and worship him
[1:11:38] because he comes in the atmosphere he
[1:11:40] inhabits the praise of his people
[1:11:43] many things we know that it's in
[1:11:45] heavenly places to be a christian
[1:11:47] means that you're in heavenly places
[1:11:51] in christ jesus amen
[1:11:56] and i'll tell you what you
[1:12:00] you think about it let me just i wanted
[1:12:02] to say this at first
[1:12:03] give me a couple minutes but even coming
[1:12:07] to church
[1:12:08] we come we come with sincerity we come
[1:12:11] and pray before the service
[1:12:12] and we begin to climb higher and higher
[1:12:15] in the spirit
[1:12:16] amen and baby said how he would get so
[1:12:19] caught up in the spirit
[1:12:20] in his preaching and so forth then he
[1:12:22] would have to come back down
[1:12:24] that night and the next day and he says
[1:12:27] coming down it's all depressing
[1:12:29] you feel horrible it's just a terrible
[1:12:31] feeling until you get back down
[1:12:33] he says that's the way it is with
[1:12:35] spiritual people that have wrote
[1:12:37] songs like uh there is a fountain filled
[1:12:40] with blood drawn from emmanuel's mains i
[1:12:42] believe it was
[1:12:43] one of those songs that they were so
[1:12:45] caught up in spirit until they
[1:12:47] they go way up in the spirit they'd pray
[1:12:50] and it get
[1:12:51] oh my just consecrate maybe for days
[1:12:53] just meditating on the lord
[1:12:54] and then they would go up so fine they'd
[1:12:56] write these songs
[1:12:58] when they come down boy it was hard
[1:13:03] amen when you're a christian it means
[1:13:04] you can climb in the atmospheres
[1:13:06] in the spheres of the heavenly and i
[1:13:09] wrote down here you know
[1:13:11] just not enough time is spent in the
[1:13:13] supernatural
[1:13:15] if we're not walking with the lord like
[1:13:16] we should is because we don't take the
[1:13:19] time
[1:13:19] amen to climb into spears that we should
[1:13:22] because we should still be writing songs
[1:13:24] how many believe that preachers still
[1:13:26] preach under the anointing of the holy
[1:13:28] ghost
[1:13:29] the holy spirit still speaks but you
[1:13:31] have to climb up higher
[1:13:33] come up in the heavenly atmosphere and
[1:13:35] that's what we come to church for
[1:13:37] amen to come come out of our work come
[1:13:40] out of our cares
[1:13:41] and set aside a few minutes just to
[1:13:43] worship the lord
[1:13:45] and caught up higher how many know that
[1:13:47] when you go out those double doors
[1:13:50] you feel better you feel better
[1:13:53] because why you've lifted up from the
[1:13:56] things of the world and now
[1:13:58] you've got a taste of the things of
[1:13:59] heaven brother david if you would come
[1:14:01] let's stand this evening and
[1:14:02] go before the lord in prayer
[1:14:11] lord jesus we come before you father
[1:14:13] we've just expressed ourselves lord
[1:14:15] expressions of our walk with the lord
[1:14:18] what it's like
[1:14:20] what it's like to walk with god lord
[1:14:22] jesus we don't know maybe there was
[1:14:24] somebody out there on the internet
[1:14:26] somebody that heard something that would
[1:14:28] encourage him say well that's what i
[1:14:30] want to
[1:14:31] i want to be a christian if that's what
[1:14:33] it means to be a christian
[1:14:35] then i want to be a christian lord jesus
[1:14:39] i just pray father that you'll take
[1:14:40] these words
[1:14:41] these testimonies god and you'll do
[1:14:43] something with it we know that you will
[1:14:45] we ask god that you help each and every
[1:14:47] one of us lord to re
[1:14:48] examine and just look at the blessings
[1:14:51] and the goodness

[1:14:54] christian lord i think of that song when
[1:14:57] i think of the goodness of jesus
[1:14:59] and all that he has done for me then my
[1:15:02] soul
[1:15:03] cries out hallelujah praise god

[1:15:45] until we know that we are reflecting you
[1:15:48] the way that we should

[1:15:51] shortcomings
