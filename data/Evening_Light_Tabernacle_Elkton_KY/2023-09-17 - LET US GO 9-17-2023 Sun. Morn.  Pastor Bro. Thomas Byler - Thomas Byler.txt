Minister him for him next Sunday amen so brother Jonathan will be here with y'all whoever's here amen and so but we'll be with you here Wednesday yet and so but anyway some of you might not see but anyway God bless you amen looking forward to a good time with brother Jewell amen and then so forth amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you once again Lord with grateful Hearts to be able to assemble ourselves together Lord on this side of Eternity Lord and Lord with your children father Lord to come to present ourselves before you Lord and to see if there's any bad places in our lives Lord and places where we need to change Lord and and Lord from what we are Lord to what we're supposed to be we ask God that you'll just take the meditation of our heart and that which we feel you've laid Upon Our Hearts to minister this morning and place it father in every heart just place it in the way that only the Holy Spirit Can Do Lord and we ask God that you bless each one here each one's streaming Lord we ask your blessing upon them Lord and we do want to thank you and praise you for your goodness Lord this morning in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen turn your bibles if you will amen amen let's go to um Philippians I believe it is thinking yes Philippians take another little thought just a couple of words amen as we have done sometimes in the past I mean just something that I felt like the Lord just laid on my heart in me to speak on uh in Philippians 3 Philippians the third chapter verse 13 through 21. Paul says Brethren I count not myself to have to have apprehended but there's one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind in reaching forth unto those things which are before I press Towers to mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if they're and if in anything ye are otherwise minded God will reveal even this unto you nevertheless where two we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing Brethren be followers together of me amen that's quite a statement for him to make isn't it amen of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for and it is simple for many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of Jesus whose in this destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind Earthly things I think Paul clearly declares what kind of people these people are isn't that right they are people who care only about their own Glory they only care about their own belly their selves and the only mind Earthly things I like what Paul says here about and he kind of continues because if you'll notice Verse 18 and verse 19 we're in parentheses there but back to our conversation verse 20 says for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his Glo his glorious body according to the work the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto him may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated I thought I would just uh name this this let us let us amen amen and I told my wife to title it let us let us go amen but I was just going to title it let just talk about let him in because I like what that word uh implies amen it applies to me uh a a word of action something that's let's do something amen and action words let us let us do something amen and Paul's saying here of course you'll see that word uh let us therefore as many as be perfect amen be thus minded and then verse 16 again let us walk let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing one thing about it is that it doesn't say I or you or myself it talks about more than one you know and not that any of us wouldn't walk with the Lord and Duty things by herself and it is a a personal walk with God but he's talking to a group of people it's more than one I don't know about you but it's nice to have more than one amen it's nice to have brothers and sisters of like Faith going having the same goal having the same ambition amen so Paul he was a he was he was quite quite a man that believed in amen forward motion it reminds me and make me think of the Israelites whenever they came to kadish Barney and they sent those spies over there so you know and then take it let's take it at once let's go we can do it because God is with us us amen because God is with us we're more than able amen uh started out basically I had the thought to kind of come to me of where brother Brandon one time he questions and answers she was talking about amen uh uh he was speaking to them he says I'm here to try to help you because I love you you're my children that I have begotten to Christ I claim every one of you I claim you tonight I claim you all the time and and I always claim you you're my brother and my sister you're my children I'm your father in The Gospel not a father like to be a priest but your father of the Gospel like Paul said there I have begotten you to Christ I have espoused you to Christ that's engaged you to Christ as a chaste virgin he said don't let me down don't let me down amen and I thought you know if that's me think if you think about how that God loves to have and how did his ambition his goal was to have a family amen the family unit how many knows that in a family uh the mom and dad they would do anything and everything that you know to raise those children and we think about how much energy and how much love and how much self-sacrifice that goes into raising children isn't that right and the raising those children and then nurturing them and and teaching them you know teaching them what to do what not to do how to act how you know hospitality and everything that you teach them amen and then uh you know as they grow over and grow older there Comes A Time there comes a time when you know you shouldn't have to have yeah hands on them more and those kindergartened maintenance proud you're not right amen and they'll make their parents proud whenever in those uh taught them to do it and they execute it very well and you know but if they don't if they Rebel and they do everything they shouldn't have done and and you know they go out perhaps as we as Christians would teach them to be Christians and serve God and how proud We Are when our fear children get filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know you don't have to be the Holy Ghost for him anymore and force them to go to church and force them to pray and this out of the other and oh no you know but they do it on their own and how proud here it is and you know that's the way it is with God Amen and I believe it was with the prophet even with the prophet he says you know you're my kids just don't let me down amen how much more for our heavenly father we don't want to let him down either Amen in order not to let him down we have to become everything that God has tried to teach us amen how many believes that we should become everything God has taught us in that's our goal our goal is like God believe it was needed to be baptized to be why comes down to me he said suffer that need to be so for thus it behooves us to fulfill all scripture amen and this morning I want to say that's what a heart's goal is this morning is to fulfill all scripture amen to become the word of God to become what Jesus said that we was to become The Works that I do show you do also amen many scriptures but this morning with the help of the lord we want to talk a while about running this race that Paul talked about about guiding the fight about uh becoming the word of God and so we think about that and how that in the parent you know it's even the prophet of God said and he preached a message on adoption and he said how that in and the Bible teaches how to you know when you're growing up as we're growing we have a tutor or a mentor and and of course he went into the great illustration in the east side of the dad was too busy to raise his children or whatever you know and he'd have a tutor to teach the children everything that needed I don't know while he's off doing business this out of the other and that tutor he would come back and he would give reports to the father of how that son was doing or how that daughter was doing amen and didn't but a bad says I wonder what the Holy Spirit would say about us this morning if he goes back to the father and say well oh you know brother Irvin over there I'm telling you he's making he's breaking your foul huh our sister whatever it might be our brother and sister you know he makes oh you'd be so proud of him he's just he's just like you he's you're spitting energy thinks like you reacts like he's got your characteristics amen but what would it be of that report like mother man says oh my yeah look he was talking about the Pentecostals oh my it's just terrible the kids can't get along they're fussing about you know whether he's coming on a white horse on a uh on a on a cloud and they're splitting up or over this Saturday other and separating themselves and oh it's just terrible how disappointed that parent would have to be how disappointed God would have to be I don't know about you but I don't want to disappoint my heavenly father this morning I want to see how I can please my heavenly father we all want to and we're coming I'm telling you we're coming to a showdown folks in this the Bible's greater than in every once the pressure is on more than ever amen as even as the Liberals even as the devil and the children of the devil are becoming more and going forward man they're pressing forward like you've never seen him press forward I want you to know the church Living God ought to be pressing forward amen forget it yesterday and forgetting what you was yesterday it's about what you are right now and what you want to be from here on [Music] foreign Paul he had the attitude just forget about all your faults forget about your failures amen is what you do now if people amen people are even in what they ought to be you would just realize that this is a new time a new day God is willing to forgive you more than you're willing to forgive yourself if you're willing to get back up and try again amen keep pressing on press starts to mark for the prize of the High Calling of God what is the prize of the High Calling of God Amen I just want to look at that with the help of the Lord amen you love him this morning if you'll notice if you go well I like let me just now just can take my time well is that all right and Earthly things but our conversation is in heaven from points also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ no doubt for the prize no doubt what he was looking for and pressing forward for was to see the Lord Jesus Christ amen that was his goal his conversation was for what's ahead aren't you glad that you have something to look forward to amen amen now notice over here in the same chapter chapter 3 verse 7 he says but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ yay doubt listen I cut all things lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord Paul could literally say I lost everything all I have is chains and bonds and imprisonments and all my all these things he says he could have lost everything but he didn't mind doing that because he counted it much more gained to know the Lord Jesus Christ how many knows he doesn't matter how many Earthly things you have your relationship with Jesus Christ amen you walk with him you talk with him your fellowship with him is much more and then he hurts the treasure will ever have of whom I have suffered the loss of all things hey man if you gonna run on a race if you're gonna finish your course if you're gonna do this you gotta be willing to set aside everything else amen and to be found of him I kind of song that I may be found of him not having my own righteousness how many say that's my goal and then when he comes I don't want to have my own righteousness but I want to be able to say I've been washed by the blood of Jesus Christ yes change me woo oh my but that which is through faith not of the law but that which is through faith of Jesus Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead how many even knows he was interested in he didn't like brother bam says I don't care how I get there I just can't sing and that is the resurrection or to you and me it would be wrongly I'm interested in one thing and that is that prize for the marked with the High Calling I want to make that Rapture I want to be in that changing of that body when this Mortal shall take on immortality I want to be able to fulfill that scripture that's gone folks I think let's go on let's go let's go let's go let us go amen I pressed starts to mark for the price let us this res-minded in other words if you've got the right kind of mind let it be in this manner amen praise be to God oh my so he says don't let me down people you stay a chaste virgin how do I do that brother bam stay right with the word live clean and pure have nothing to do with the things of the world amen in Hebrews six I believe it is he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ let us go let us go on amen aren't you glad that you can can you imagine if yours no Pursuit there's amen I want you to think about it think about where you are with the Lord how many believes that you can go further than what you are yes I believe so I believe every one of us could say this morning I believe that I can go further let us go on now let's go on Amen and I like this one over here Hebrews oh my wherefore seeing we also are compassed about we're so great at Cloud as Witnesses let us let us Amen Let Us lay aside every way and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us amen now owner look at something first of all the race has set before us to get to the place talked about two different things he says I have finished my course I've run my race amen but Paul knew what it was like to fight in a battle and he knew what it's like to run in a race amen it's talking about seeing that we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses in other words there's many witnesses that have run this same race we find it over in verse 30. 2 of the same chapter what shall I say more of Samson Jeff the David also and Samuel and all the prophets who threws Faith subdued kingdoms Rod righteousness obtain promises stop the mouths of lions amen I know that's what Daniel did quenched the violence of fire three Hebrew children escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant and fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens amen notice these were the ones that ran before us they had a race to run amen how many times you and I we got a race to run and it's like a relay race amen we'll get to that in a minute women received their dead raise again to life and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain amen now what Paul say Amen you know so fight I that I may obtain that one that beateth the air amen but you you struggle and you fight to obtain Amen to get to something that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of the bonds and imprisonments they were stoned they were saw on a Sunday they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wondered about in sheepskins and gold skins and being tested destitute my afflicted tormented and then we whine and cry when we have a little trouble come our way huh of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the Earth hello you say that was the Old Testament no that was New Testament also sure it was the Old Testament but also new remember the catacombs of Rome brother and sister Martha they know all about it hiding in caves and and Medicaid well I understand one place I read where their caves were so expensive but the only reason they didn't catch them because the people the Believers knew the caves how to go way back in there without getting lost you could get back there and get lost never come back out live underground folks and then we have it so rough we can't come to church on Sunday come on folks isn't that right when I think about the 68 million folks that run their race they're on their lap amen they run their Church age seven laps somebody else was handed the Baton remember they always thinks he's mad but never in spirit the Holy Spirit taking another church hey they were put in the ground they run their race they give up their life they died in Christ they sealed their testimony they're over there under their messenger your age isn't that right under the altar under their messenger huh how many believes each one of them had comes up with their messenger when brother Benham seen them all of them he didn't see Paul's group and Irene is this group and Martin's group and everybody else no he's seen his group these are Yukon merch huh but they all ran that race now notice even in the Old Testament having obtained a good report they all obtained a good report but they received not the promise God having provided some better things for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen listen to what the problem of God and the way he says this when we rally there with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob he says those who were The Heirs of the promise he says they're looking forward to us not to fail amen for without us they cannot be made perfect how they're depending on us this morning let's not fail how many can say oh let us run let's run this race let's buckle up the armor and fight a little harder let's become those messages that's become the Bible let's become the word amen let us do it we can huh can a man do all these things Bill mention something do you think that it is again he says Hebrews 11 says all those who wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins destitute and all these things that they've done yet was not made perfect without us the holy spirit in this church today let's receive the token of the baptism and the Holy Spirit that the blood has been shed and that the holy spirit is upon the church because without us they cannot rise they are depending on us think about it we know that there was a resurrection and Abraham and his group came out from where they went went into a paradise but they can't come and they can't see the Lord Jesus Christ amen just like Brother Band and all those good boy they're waiting oh my God thank them all of the agers are waiting on you and me they can't see him until we finish what we started here when God has started in US and they count on you you're counting on me think about it think of how that puts it on it's just like a relay Runner you know and when they had one passes on the batons and the other one more that personal just to get it they're just to get it as hard as they can and when that last one receives that last baton they give it all they got I started to win and we're gonna win because why God has put it in you to win foreign was it Sea Biscuit that had the bigger heart huh secretary secretary when I was standing here I thought about secretary you know because they meant she would win and then it would win Time After Time After Time Again amen later on I guess yes off she revealed that he had it was a female uh male male called secretary all right it was a male secretary but anyway I thought you know that that it was it was special in design and that's what you are this morning you're especially designed you've been given something to win with you've stopped you've been given something to overcome with Amen to all my brothers says one place if she'll get a real revelation of who she is and that she can do the great Awards the devil will be powerless before her how many that's all I like a devil I like the devil powerless in front of me he wants to depress you he wants to make you the Sad and Blue I'm telling you I like when he's or less when you get a revelation of who you are he becomes powerless oh Jesus stripped him of his power isn't that right and he gave you the victory that's why Paul said just like this the spices we're able we're more than able but the apostles we're more we're more than conquerors to him that loved us amen thank God praise God you sitting there this morning you're defying the devil you defied the devil this morning praise the Lord I think about those Warriors that was their calling those that went around this race before us down through the Dark Ages there's be thou faithful until death amen scripture says many of them be put into prison amen the scripture said they'll die they'll give their lives amen sure you say well that was defeat no that was Victory every time one person took their last breath amen they sealed their Shield their eternal life and they overcame the pressure that they tried to squeeze him they tried to make them recant they would not do it it was a victory every one of them that died it was a victory even the parents would tell their children no don't you cry huh you stand fast parents having to tell their children to die bravely um I said let's run this layout let's see over let's run let us run this race the state that's it before it lay aside every ship lay aside every way don't be our way to town he was the sun sets free is free and eat let us run this thing with everything we got let's run this lukewarmness over this layout I see a haphazard hey man stuff over we're gonna make it to the finish line amen let's fight this battle fight the devil amen praise the Lord I like this let us run with patience the race that is set before us amen it's up to us now hello believes he's up to us us preachers starting with us preachers Amen to get trained right God is training his people for the battle that leads ahead praise be the god amen pressing for the mark to fulfill everything that God has said that he was going to do amen praise be to God Romans 13 and 11. Paul says and that knowing the time that now it is high time to wake God asleep for now is our Salvation nearer than what we believed the night is far span amen remember it is the rising of the Sun but Abraham says that morning star shine shines its brightest just before day breaks it gets the darkest Just Before Dawn and he says the night that morning star Jesus Christ is shining the brightest even upon the Earth amen with the power with the of Heavens coming all across the Earth through what he did through Malachi 4 that morning star of Christ shining brighter than ever he said the night is almost over but he said it's almost fixed this paper these church services like this will be all done with one of these days all of our jobs and everything else all be all a thing of the past we'll have to think like Paul thinks keep our mind on heaven and not on this go let us therefore cast off the works of dark the armor alike amen I think of how many times the Bible says let's put off the old man and put on the new man I mean that's what it's time for amen put off the works of the of the flesh the all malice and all envy and all hatred and all emulation and your strife and let it all be put off put on a new man amen that is renewed day by day let's put on the fruits of the spirit love and joy and peace and long suffering amen put on the armor of light praise be to God let's fulfill Ephesians 6. therefore putting on Amen let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantingness not in strife and envying amen let us notice how the all these let us let us therefore cast off let us walk honestly in the day it's not in chambering and writing not in strife and envying but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ amen how many believed you can put the Lord Jesus Christ on put him off put him in there let him clothe you let him speak through your mouth think to your mind walk with your feet move with your hands put on the Lord Jesus Christ how many believe that's what we need to do put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for amen light is far spent it's time to put on other things amen first Thessalonians he kind of said the same thing first Thessalonians 5 he says it this way Paul says for yourselves no verse Two Perfect like that the day of the Lord shall cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief hear all the children of the light and the children of their we are not of the night not a nor of the darkness how many dread not to be part of this Darkness that's out there that's right now another therefore let us not sleep in other words how many believe it's time to wake up I believe it's time for our Believers to wake up [Music] and realize who you are and what belongs to you as do others not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober that's exactly what Jesus said let's fulfill the scriptures I don't know about you but I'm interested in fulfilling even Jesus is scripture where he talks about it talks about watch and pray for you know not the day that of your lord has come but if that if you didn't watch that he was talking about if the Master of the House when he's watching his house he will not suffer his house and be broken up fill the scripture where he says you know my Lord delays his coming and the mom will began to do things that you ought to do because you think the Lord's not coming yet I would have fulfill that scripture where Jesus says be ready how many grip you this morning I want to fulfill that part that's what Paul I want to know that I am apprehended of God I like what he said I am apprehended God has apprehended me aren't you glad to be apprehended you know when we think of apprehension we think of apprehending the criminal or something is that right and I'm telling what when you get on the FBI's top 10 list or number one list you know they're gonna find you huh how many how many stories have you read of people going out in the jungles not so long ago that guy killed his girlfriend remember and he went over in the jungles and he was a rivalist yeah they found him they had to go they went out there searching for him from what I understand found his body isn't that right no I'll find your body if you go hide you know I'll find your body they'll find you I'd be glad that when God comes out to you when God comes to looking for you to apprehend you he gonna find you Paul said I am happy ending of him and he's doing a work in me amen I love that amen Jesus is be ready let's look at some of the scriptures that we want to fulfill let's do amen let us fulfill all righteousness amen my it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness and feel this scriptures how many believes it that goes for everyone in here right but that's not what we're interested in we're interested in fulfilling what God said about us to please God almighty amen to not you know and there's something about a family name how many knows that you know a lot of times when there's a family you know and if you're closely knit family and so forth whenever somebody does something it's amazing it's amazing if you're a genuine brother and sisters of stuff that will forgive each other in the family huh we'll forgive each other why because we're brother and we're sister and when their brother and sister does something we don't go telling everybody else we don't tell the neighbors and everybody in church hey my brother really messed up or my sister really messed up there you know do this out of the other I found that when somebody spreads the stuff that you do bad they're not your friend they're not your friend they're your enemy and even brother bam says you know when you know something about somebody don't go telling everybody you go in your closet and you pray for them when you go to spread it is just you just you know what are you smearing his name making him look bad in the family we don't want to look bad amen any family wants to have a good name what does the Bible say about a good name is better than rubies and so forth no family that doesn't want to have but a good name amen and that's what we want to do is reflect be a reflection of him how many say Lord help me not to bring reproach upon the cause of Christ don't let me reproach His Name Lord let me be filled with everything that you said I was to be filled with how many believe that it's time to get filled up fill up with God add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to acknowledge Temple Prince Lord let me have that patience let me have that God it's not the time not just to preach it but it's time to possess it that's if you don't have it go get it let's do it because one of these days we're going to fulfill the scriptures that we're even our vile bodies will change how many believe that we'll be changed that's what our heart's goal is Lord that's what I want to fulfill but in order to get bad we're gonna have to become Ephesians 4 there when you talk to somebody what I like what brother Brown says man we have all made our mistakes have we we've made mistakes that we regret I don't like to think about it as a matter of fact brother Troy whenever I go to thinking about it I like block it out say devil you just take that little fishing pole of yours go fishing somewhere else I'm not interested in eating the fish that I'm gonna grab that fish and I'm gonna stuff it in his mouth say you eat that fish all right you brought it up it's under the blood now you're responsible for it you're the one that caused in the first place my Bible told me that he was the one that was responsible for it we never did it in the first place it was him that was the boss of it in the Garden of Eden I'm at least he was the fault of it he started it all anyway all sin is on his shoulders take that devil that's right you want to remind me of my past I remind you your future hey man we're gonna catch you in the Lake of Fire amen and

Paul said put on the whole armor of God and having done all the stands stand there for I believe we're living in the hour when we need to be fully armored put on the whole armor of God then you might be able to stand against the walls of the devil amen I believe it don't you oh yeah I believe it it's true listen to this brother Batman talking about the greatest battle it was ever fought he said and Daniel says that there would be a time of trouble such as it was never what was before on the earth and we're living in that time huh we're living in that time when culture and education and

God to be able to use me amen you use me for his honor and for his glory amen listen to this but we have to listen to this having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus Christ by a New and Living Way which he has consecrated us forth through the Veil Down that is to say that is his flesh and having a heart and full Assurance of faith oh Muhammad believes that heart's got to be right and we gotta we want that full assurance oh I don't know about you but I go through today and I say Lord Jesus I just want to know because that Prophet said that don't take a chance on it you want to make sure that you're right I want to know that I know that I know so Lord if there's something in my heart shouldn't be there you make sure that I get to make it right come to that time and not have my ticket in my hand y'all remember the black butter you better man talked about he says you know I want my ticket in my hand I want everything clear I want a full Assurance of faith in my heart and we can't how many beliefs you can't have you can have that full assurance that you are right with God because you've got a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and so forth listen to what he says it says on a heart sprinkled from an evil conscience amen that's right and our bodies washed with pure water oh let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering amen let us consider one another to provoke one another to love and to Good Works amen how many believe that we are to provoke one another to love and to Good Works how do we do this listen to the very next word not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together amen you guys huh no come to the house of God encourage your brothers and sisters Amen to do good works amen not forsaking disassembling ourselves together as a man of some is but exhorting one another and so much tomorrow as you see today approaching Hallelujah isn't it wonderful to be in the house of God I thought you know there's one thing that makes it pop and one thing that makes a parent happy is when their children are in the house of God when your children are not where they're supposed to be it's a disappointment their children are right with God you let them down you're a letdown I have one that believes that you ought to be able by God's grace you want to move the devil is the only one that does it but to be able to have your children right there with you worshiping ought to make you a little happy say praise be to God amen say thank you Jesus more than anything in the world all the money in the world could not buy that for you Lord help me I don't want to be a letdown to my heavenly father I don't want to be a let down the prophet of God don't let me down he said don't let me down you become this word you'll become what I preached how many with me yeah that's what I want I want to be in the stature of a perfect man I want to stand in the full armor of God oh my God I'm gonna be filled with the fullness of God it just comes to amen the scripture comes to mind I'll try to go to it right quick amen you love the Lord this morning I thought about that I said Lord don't let me be a disappointment to you Lord don't let me let you down amen Hallelujah let's not let our heavenly father down or be a disappointment to him amen praise the Lord all right Ephesians 4 I believe it is if I can find it now this I like I like this Bible whenever you have the same Bible so you can go to that same page and just pick it up oh come on now praise the Lord right here it is Ephesians 4. listen to this he says he gave some Apostles some prophets and evangelists pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all I like that till we all come to the unity of the faith isn't it Lovely isn't it just awesome when you are a perfect Unison with somebody oh that's when they disagree with you no I don't believe it that's when you're gonna get ripped the wrong way whether you're going to still like him or not love them or not but Believers they're supposed to have Unity of Faith isn't that right same goals same ambitions of the knowledge in and of uh till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Lord Jesus that's what I say and I'm hoping this morning if nothing else just ask yourself what area of your life can you let God in a little bit more yet because why we want to be filled with the fullness of God I want him to have complete control I want to be completely surrendered to him whoo come on if you think about your life right now think about it God will show you but maybe not you but he does me amen I hope he does you till we come to the fullness of Christ that ye henceforth be no more children in other words come to adoption how many beliefs it's time for God's children to come tell you anymore I think God maybe that just comes to mind maybe that's where God wanted Moses to be God expected a lot out of Moses didn't he but red I mean he allowed that Red Sea to be there he allowed him to come to a trap and then when he cried he rebuked him when he cried and he rebuked him Joshua on the other hand Joshua didn't cry did he Joshua didn't cry from understanding he didn't pray he just said Son stand still Moon you stay where you're at huh how many blue leaves that if Moses wouldn't have cried and he just take the stick and he feed it said it's part no doubt God would have departed it maybe that's what God was expecting amen he certainly stopped it for Joshua isn't that right the Sun and the Moon and if God just says why do you cry this be speak to work and go forward go over there and open it up can I bring it down to where we live come on could you crying speak the word and go forward so this ain't too big however big this is it's not too big for God amen devil you just get on out of here amen you're giving you trouble amen that's right listen to no more children carried about with every wind of Doctrine by this letter side of men kind of crafting us for everybody they lie and wait to this Eve anyway but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in some things no in all things that's why Peter said there and for a second Peter the first chapter he says if these things being you and about they make you that they're you're neither bare nor unfruitful in the knowledge of God another place it'll make you where you'll never fall if the if you have all of the things in fiddly join together and come back about every joint that it supplies according to the effects of working of the major of every part brings increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love hey man let me go a couple more I've got a couple more scriptures I'm going to cover before closing Hebrews four let's go back to the book of Hebrews foreign the same one about the high priest as this one does here to he Brews for an 11 I believe it is no that's the one I just looked at all right 4 16. let us no that's still the same one 10 and 30. all right we already read some of those Hebrews 4 and 1 though we haven't Hebrews 4 1 let us therefore fear these a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it amen front to us was the Gospel preach as well as unto them but the word being preached to profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said I have sworn in my wrath if this shall enter into my wrath although the works were finished from the foundations of the world so here he's talking about Israel of course how did they did not enter into arrest and here it says let us be let us fear in other words don't let one promise not be fulfilled in your heart amen let it all be fulfilled in your heart so that we aren't left outside of resting in him how many wants to be in that place rest like Dan and like Daniel was he he didn't miss out anything I don't know about you but I don't want to miss any of the promise of God now how many knows that's what Israel missed they missed having faith and never did enter into God's rest because if they missed something I mean that's the same thing the foolish virgin dude they missed something they didn't have oil in their lamps young people especially let me tell you something you may have all the head knowledge but to take more on head knowledge you have to have the promise of the Holy Spirit right in here or your mommy and Daddy'll go but you won't go amen it has to be a personal relationship so Paul says here in Hebrews he says let us fear least there is a promise that just to keep that that we all have not yet entered into rest amen like Daniel like I said he was I don't know some people kind of preach in different ways but you know I just happen to believe that Daniel he wasn't scared no no he completely was resting in the fact that he was in God's care amen I don't know but he was so so much the three Hebrew children they were so brave that they said we aren't fearful of what the king says you know he may not deliver it but there's one thing we know we're not going to bow we're gonna do the right thing it was in that place now I want to tell you something I believe in this hour that you and I are living in now when I think about having entered into God's rest in the promise of his rest because that's what God wants us to be he's come completely into his rest millions of years of that God was perhaps by himself he was completely content he was he he completely he rests he was God's rest he wasn't frustrated about it everything amen we frustrate ourselves our own mind can get us frustrated and everything but the Holy Spirit brings a rest amen that no matter what it is oh if Israel could have just had it no matter what time whether they were hungry whether they were in a trap no matter if they just rested in Christ oh my God and God allowed things to come our way if you're a child of God I mean God's going to allow things to come in your way to see whether you're truly in that rest or whether you're not in that rest this this world can have all all of this glamor and all of its entertainments it can have all of that I don't need any of that I'm satisfied with what God has given me and that's the peace of God that passes understanding how many glad to have the peace of God of God that passes understanding let the peace of God the Bible says rule in your heart because if it isn't peace ruling there it's something else it's torment ruling in there if it is the rest of God resting in there people are oh my they got to have another tattoo they got to have this that or the other folks I don't need one tattoo I don't have to paint myself to make myself feel better red and blue [Music] oh my how many stats have entered into his rest amen God bless you stand with me this morning if you will God bless you this morning I hope that this Hearts this morning this morning to say father Lord don't allow me father to let you down I don't want to let you down lord I don't want to be a disappointment to you Lord but I want to become Lord everything that you have said about me Lord let every word let Thy word Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word that's just powerheads and say that Lord Jesus let it be unto me according to your word Lord we are here father to come into the fullness Lord and I know that all of those who have gone before us Lord and have run their race dear waiting on us to finish our race to come to where we're supposed to be because one of these days and we have all God when we

satisfied it's beautiful there but Lord Jesus who are all kind of Be With You Lord and one of these days you're gonna come when this body is finished Garden when you've done Lord your work through these thoughts Lord Jesus that are running this final race Lord and I feel it in my heart I feel it in my soul God that your sword and we're just about oh lordy Jesus we ask God that you help us impress yourself into US greater help us to put you on more in a greater way Lord Lord take out anything that's unlike you father and have us prepare for that great hour that lays ahead Lord have us
