[22:03] Amen. Aren't you thankful for his mercy
[22:06] and grace this morning? Amen. It's good
[22:08] to be in the house of the Lord this
[22:09] morning. It It's good to have our
[22:11] visitors with us. God bless you. And
[22:13] I've lost them somewhere. Where did they
[22:16] go to? Where's Hezekiah?
[22:19] Oh, right there they are. I'm sorry. I
[22:21] got good eyes. They just don't always
[22:23] work together. It's glad to have him and
[22:25] his mom here with us this morning. And
[22:26] we've got several folks out. We've got a
[22:29] few sick this morning. But uh I just
[22:32] wanted to uh read this little update.
[22:35] Most of you probably have already read
[22:37] it from Sister Parish. Says, "Please
[22:39] remember me in prayer. For the last
[22:41] couple of months at night, my body is so
[22:45] stiff and sore. I can't hardly get out
[22:47] of bed that with my feet and legs. I
[22:50] don't see an my oncologist till January.
[22:54] My strength is better and I weigh about
[22:57] 132 pounds now. She's really happy about
[23:00] her weight and she said uh
[23:03] I I want to uh thank brother Austin.
[23:06] Brother Austin, thank you for coming by
[23:08] and seeing her. She really appreciated
[23:10] that. and she said that sister Mary Jane
[23:12] and them brought her lunch from service
[23:15] last Sunday and she enjoyed the
[23:16] fellowship and she just uh appreciated
[23:19] that. So if you get a chance go by and
[23:21] see her and I know she'll be blessed and
[23:24] you'll be blessed by doing that for her
[23:26] and we're just thankful that the Lord's
[23:28] done a work for and we're just believing
[23:29] he's going to heal her completely. Amen.
[23:31] And you know and we we've got a lot to
[23:34] be thankful for this morning and we just
[23:36] want to thank the Lord this morning. And
[23:38] also I have one announcement I want to
[23:40] do that and then we're going to open the
[23:42] service in a word of prayer. And uh most
[23:44] of you know that we shut the water on
[23:46] and off for the fellowship hall because
[23:48] we have a real bad water leak. Well,
[23:50] there's a white thing down here where
[23:52] the old church used to be. So if you
[23:54] turn the water on when you put that cap
[23:57] back on there, just set it on there till
[23:58] you feel it snug. That's all you have to
[24:00] do because uh somebody put it on really
[24:04] good and me and brother Willie couldn't
[24:06] get it off without a crowbar. So, just
[24:08] barely snug it. When you turn the water
[24:10] off and on, you don't have to put much
[24:12] pressure. It It does it itself. So, I
[24:15] told Brother Willie, he's just getting
[24:17] old. That's what his problem is. And I'm
[24:19] already there. So, but God bless you.
[24:21] How many's happy to be a Christian this
[24:23] morning? Amen. Amen. And we're gonna ask
[24:26] Brother Glenn if he'd open the service
[24:27] in a word of prayer this morning.
[24:29] Brother Glenn.
[25:15] Amen. Let's sing that little chorus. He
[25:16] is Lord. As brother Troy comes for the
[25:18] Bible reading. For he is Lord.
[25:23] Come ahead, brother Troy. Oh, he is
[25:27] Lord.
[25:31] He has risen from the dead and he is
[25:38] Lord.
[25:42] Every knee shall bow.
[25:48] Every tongue
[25:51] confess
[25:54] that Jesus
[25:57] Christ
[25:59] is Lord.
[26:04] If you'll just go with me in the Psalms
[26:06] this morning. We're going to be in
[26:07] Psalms 25.
[26:14] Sure is a beautiful day out. We can
[26:17] enjoy the day that the Lord's given
[26:19] given us. It's been so good to us.
[26:21] Psalms 25.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Yay. Let none that wait on thee be
[26:41] ashamed. Let them be ashamed which
[26:43] transgress without cause.
[26:50] Lead me in thy truth and teach me. For
[26:53] thou art the God of my salvation. On
[26:56] thee do I wait all the day.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Remember not the sins of my youth, nor
[27:09] my transgressions. according to thy
[27:11] mercy. Remember thou me for thy goodness
[27:14] sake, O Lord.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; The meek will he guide in judgment and
[27:24] the meek will he teach his way.
[27:34] For thy name's sake, oh Lord, pardon
[27:37] mine iniquity, for it is great.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; His soul shall dwell in ease, and his
[27:49] seed shall inherit the earth.
[27:58] My eyes are ever toward the Lord, for he
[28:00] shall pluck my feet out of the net.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; The troubles of my heart are enlarged.
[28:12] Oh, bring thou me out of the my
[28:13] distress.
[28:20] Consider mine enemies for they are many
[28:23] and they hate me with cruel hatred.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Let integrity and uprightness preserve
[28:34] me for I will wait on thee. Redeem
[28:37] Israel, oh God, out of all his troubles.

[47:52] Well, good morning, church.
[47:55] I You all know my story. I've been a
[47:58] Christian for five years and this song
[48:01] I'm going to sing for the Lord. It's
[48:04] called I don't have to worry anymore.
[48:06] And that's me. I don't worry about
[48:08] anything. So, God bless all of you. I
[48:12] hope you enjoy this.
[48:29] Down here my burdens heavy
[48:35] and the road seems rough and long.
[48:40] Sometimes my feet grow weary
[48:45] and so sore.
[48:50] But a brighter day is coming.
[48:55] Soon I'll step on heaven shore.
[49:00] And I won't have to worry
[49:06] anymore.
[49:10] I won't have to worry
[49:15] when I reach the other shore.
[49:20] All my troubles will be over
[49:25] and I'll rest forever more.
[49:31] My eyes will be on Jesus
[49:35] and my heart will be a glow and I won't
[49:43] have to worry
[49:46] anymore.
[50:10] Someday when life is over
[50:15] and I said my last goodbye.
[50:20] I'll see my Savior standing at the door.
[50:29] Then I'll hear him say, "You're welcome.
[50:34] All your tears you've left behind."
[50:39] And I won't have to worry
[50:44] anymore.
[50:48] No, I won't have to worry.
[50:53] When I reach the other shore,
[50:58] all my troubles will be over
[51:03] and I'll rest forever more.
[51:08] My eyes will be on Jesus
[51:13] and my heart will be a glow and I won't
[51:20] have to worry
[51:23] anymore.
[51:27] Oh, my eyes will be on Jesus
[51:32] and my heart will be a glow and I won't
[51:39] have to worry
[51:42] anymore.
[51:49] Amen.
[51:55] Enjoy that song.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Aren't you looking for that
[52:00] day? I won't have to worry anymore.

[52:08] blessing to you this morning. And just
[52:10] want to
[52:12] just turn our hearts to what God has for
[52:15] us this morning. And Amen. And
[52:19] Amen. Let's just ask Brother Thomas to
[52:21] come. And as he comes, let's sing that
[52:23] little chorus of Amazing Grace. How
[52:26] sweet the sound that saved a wretch like
[52:28] me this morning. And pray your heart's
[52:30] ready for the word this morning.
[52:33] Oh, it's amazing

[52:39] how sweet
[52:42] the sound
[52:45] that save

[52:50] like me.
[52:54] Well, I once
[52:58] was lost,
[53:00] but now
[53:03] I'm found.
[53:05] I was blind,
[53:08] but now
[53:11] I see. It was grace.
[53:16] What was grace
[53:19] that taught
[53:21] my heart
[53:24] to fear
[53:27] and grace
[53:30] my fears
[53:32] really
[53:37] how precious
[53:40] is
[53:42] that grace

[54:08] Oh, I had
[54:12] already
[54:15] come.
[54:19] It was great
[54:22] that brought
[54:24] me susp.

[56:42] Wednesday. Okay. Amen. With all the
[56:45] different things going on Wednesday
[56:47] night, we'll just go ahead and have
[56:48] Tuesday. It was kind of requested that
[56:50] way. So I said we'll try to make that
[56:52] happen. I said, "All right."
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Tuesday night we'll have
[56:56] another service, but not not Wednesday.
[56:59] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[57:03] Hopefully after today, this summer
[57:05] winter will be over.
[57:08] Amen. Oh my, feels like summer out
[57:12] there, don't it? My grass is fixing to
[57:15] grow if it don't be careful. And I know
[57:17] all the bugs came out of my walls and
[57:20] flying around. They thought it was
[57:22] spring time, you know. So, I'm like,
[57:24] y'all get back in there, you know.
[57:27] You ain't done yet.
[57:29] Amen. God bless you this morning. Amen.
[57:32] Let's bow our heads.
[57:34] Lord Jesus, we come before you this
[57:36] morning, grateful, Lord, to be able to
[57:38] assemble ourselves together once more
[57:40] this side of eternity. Lord, to open
[57:42] your word, Father, to worship you, to
[57:45] gather together and worship you in
[57:46] spirit and in truth. Father, in spirit
[57:50] is where we are in your Holy Spirit,
[57:52] God. For we know that we have to be
[57:54] really truly in your spirit to be able
[57:56] to worship you. So, Father, we ask God
[57:58] that we be in spirit. And then also,
[58:00] Father, as we open the Bible, we know
[58:02] that we're reading the truth. So, Lord,
[58:04] in truth, we also worship you, Father.
[58:06] And we ask God that you'll just reveal
[58:08] yourself in a greater way this morning
[58:10] and just bless the thoughts of our
[58:12] heart, meditation of our heart as we try
[58:14] to Lord just convey to the people what
[58:16] Lord I feel Lord you've laid upon a
[58:18] heart Lord to bring to the people this
[58:20] morning. We ask these blessings in Jesus
[58:22] name. Amen and amen. Praise the Lord.
[58:26] God bless you this morning. We just feel
[58:29] uh like the Lord has laid something on
[58:31] our heart and I was just uh astounded
[58:35] really because Amen. It seems like
[58:38] sometimes when the things come Amen they
[58:40] come faster and I can write them down.
[58:42] Amen. Amen. And so uh Amen. the Lord's
[58:47] given us I don't know we'll you know how
[58:49] far how long we'll go on this uh but I
[58:52] do plan on if nothing changes minister
[58:55] the next three services. Amen. At least
[58:57] the next three. So, Amen. We might just
[59:00] take this this as a little series. Amen.
[59:03] And so, because there's so much in there
[59:05] and there's a lot of little rabbit
[59:07] trails I'd like to go down. Amen.
[59:09] Because, you know, just not to skip over
[59:12] everything, but just to try to glean
[59:13] out. Amen. Everything that there is.
[59:16] Amen. So, Amen. Amen. Brother Tommy
[59:20] texted this morning. Amen. It said
[59:23] something about pray the Lord will give
[59:24] you a double portion. Amen. So I says,
[59:27] "Boy, we're going to be here twice as
[59:28] long."
[59:31] He should have said potion.
[59:33] I thought he should say potion maybe.
[59:36] Amen. Uh double potion of anointing.
[59:39] Amen. Amen. Be twice as powerful instead
[59:42] of twice as long.
[59:46] Amen. But anyway, just Amen. For
[59:49] whatever that's worth. Amen. Amen. God
[59:52] is good, isn't he?
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I trust you're
[59:57] having a good winter. Everything's going
[59:59] good. If you need anything, if you have
[1:00:01] any kind of need at all, Amen. We're
[1:00:03] here, Amen, to be a blessing and to
[1:00:05] help. Amen. So, never hesitate. Amen. If
[1:00:08] you need something, Amen. So, this is
[1:00:12] kind of different. I don't think in 32
[1:00:15] years of ministering that I've ever took
[1:00:18] this subject before. So, it's a new
[1:00:20] subject. Amen. That's hard to do after
[1:00:23] preaching for 30 33 years. Amen. But
[1:00:26] anyway, um
[1:00:30] we trust that the Lord will just it'll
[1:00:32] be a blessing to you this morning. I
[1:00:34] know that this this has the potential,
[1:00:40] this message has the potential, Amen, to
[1:00:43] really lift us up.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's bragging about God.
[1:00:50] It's talking about God. It's glorifying
[1:00:54] God. Amen. Amen. Because what else are
[1:00:57] you going to glorify?
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Whatever. What else are you going to
[1:01:01] lift up? Amen. And bring honor and glory
[1:01:03] to. Amen.
[1:01:05] So, we're going to take it slow with the
[1:01:07] help of the Lord, but just try to follow
[1:01:09] the leading of the spirit. Amen. And so,
[1:01:12] we'll turn our Bibles this morning uh to
[1:01:15] the book of Luke, if you will. Let's go
[1:01:18] to the book of Luke. Amen.
[1:01:29] The second chapter.
[1:01:33] We'll just read from verse 41 down to
[1:01:37] 49. And then I want to take really not
[1:01:41] on the main subject, but just take a
[1:01:43] little doctrine, a little thought out of
[1:01:45] this before we go on. Amen. And we'll
[1:01:48] just take it one step at a time and see
[1:01:50] what the Lord will have. Amen. Maybe
[1:01:53] maybe Tuesday night. Amen. We will speak
[1:01:56] on uh let me see what I would have maybe
[1:02:00] titled it. Uh this day are fulfilled.
[1:02:06] theseures fulfilled. Amen. Amen. And so
[1:02:10] we might Amen. Take that Tuesday if the
[1:02:13] Lord's will. We'll just see. Amen.
[1:02:17] Two. And verse 41. Now his parents went
[1:02:20] to Jerusalem every year at the feast of
[1:02:23] the Passover.
[1:02:25] And when he was 12 years old, they went
[1:02:28] up to Jerusalem after the custom of the
[1:02:30] feast. And when they had fulfilled the
[1:02:33] days, as they returned, the child Jesus
[1:02:35] terried behind in Jerusalem,
[1:02:39] and Joseph and his mother knew not of
[1:02:42] it.
[1:02:44] Amen. But they, him to have been in
[1:02:48] company, went a day's journey, and and
[1:02:52] they sought him among their kin folks.
[1:02:55] Must have been a pretty good little
[1:02:56] crowd,
[1:02:58] right? The whole family had to go, I
[1:02:59] guess, maybe. And when they found him,
[1:03:02] not they turned back again. Amen. I can
[1:03:05] imagine that would be kind of a
[1:03:06] disappointment, wouldn't it?
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; I mean, a whole day's journey on with
[1:03:13] mules or whatever they had, right? Uh,
[1:03:16] you know, and they had to go all the way
[1:03:18] back. And it came to pass that after
[1:03:21] three days they found him in the temple
[1:03:24] sitting in the midst of the doctors,
[1:03:28] both hearing them and asking them
[1:03:30] questions. And all that heard him were
[1:03:33] astonished at his understanding
[1:03:37] and answers. Amen. But Abraham said he
[1:03:40] was about 12 years old. And when they
[1:03:42] saw him, they were amazed.
[1:03:45] And his mother said unto him, "Son, why
[1:03:49] hast thou dealt thus with us? Behold,
[1:03:52] thy father and I have sought thee
[1:03:55] sorrowing."
[1:03:57] And he, now notice of all the things
[1:03:59] that he could say to him, right?
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; How many knows that whenever Jesus
[1:04:04] spoke, he always said the right thing?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So much so that when the
[1:04:08] Pharisees, they tried to trick him with
[1:04:11] questions many times. Amen. And after
[1:04:14] about two or three questions and him
[1:04:16] absolutely flooring them, they dares not
[1:04:19] ask him any more questions.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; So, amen. And so, here is another time
[1:04:27] when he makes a statement and he said
[1:04:28] unto them, "How is it that ye sought
[1:04:31] me?" Amen. He never said, "Yes, mother.
[1:04:36] Sorry, mom and dad. My father and my
[1:04:39] mother." He never said that. He said,
[1:04:41] "How is it that ye sought me? Wish ye
[1:04:44] not that I must be about my father's
[1:04:48] business."
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; And they understood not the saying which
[1:04:52] he spake unto them. Amen. May God add
[1:04:55] his blessings to the reading of words.
[1:04:57] You can be seated.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; There's some quite a few profound things
[1:05:01] in him in this statement. For one thing,
[1:05:04] brother Brandon preached a message and
[1:05:06] he was talking about the age that we
[1:05:09] were living in that after the church
[1:05:12] world had rejected Christ and how that
[1:05:15] they uh thought that Christ was was
[1:05:18] still with them. How many believes those
[1:05:19] churches still believe that Jesus is
[1:05:21] with them even though they he's outside
[1:05:24] of the door knocking?
[1:05:27] And he makes a statement that they have
[1:05:29] went on without him and don't realize
[1:05:31] that he's not with them anymore.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't put Christ out and
[1:05:37] expect him still to be with you. And
[1:05:39] that's why they're in the condition that
[1:05:41] they're in. The other thing I want to
[1:05:43] bring here is brother Benaman as he he
[1:05:45] uh expounded on this and he says, you
[1:05:47] know, even Mary and Joseph didn't
[1:05:52] understand what he meant by what he just
[1:05:54] said.
[1:05:59] THE BOY WAS 12 YEARS OLD. WHAT KIND OF
[1:06:02] BUSINESS is the boy going to have?
[1:06:05] And his father, they thought, well,
[1:06:07] Joseph, you know, this don't LOOK LIKE
[1:06:09] CONSTRUCTION WORK TO ME
[1:06:12] BECAUSE HIS FATHER, SO TO SPEAK, EARTHLY
[1:06:15] SPEAKING, it's what they supposed uh
[1:06:18] would be JOSEPH WOULD BE A CARPENTER
[1:06:20] BECAUSE JOSEPH WAS A CARPENTER. BUT YET
[1:06:23] HERE HE WAS up in the synagogue
[1:06:28] TALKING TO THE PRIEST ASKING HIM
[1:06:30] QUESTIONS and answering them so much SO
[1:06:33] THAT THIS LITTLE boy could answer
[1:06:36] questions and flabbergast the priests.
[1:06:42] Wow, where does this boy get all this
[1:06:43] knowledge? Remember that was just in his
[1:06:47] infancy. Amen.
[1:06:50] But the point was is that he was about
[1:06:53] his father's business. And you want to
[1:06:54] pull that up this morning. I want to
[1:06:56] preach on the father's business.
[1:07:00] The father's business.
[1:07:03] Amen. Thought about calling it God the
[1:07:07] businessman.
[1:07:10] Amen. God the businessman.
[1:07:15] How many God's a businessman? SURE.
[1:07:19] IF HIS FATHER HAS A BUSINESS, he's got
[1:07:22] to be a be a businessman.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:29] And you know, in order to run a
[1:07:31] business,
[1:07:33] if you're going to be a mason, you got
[1:07:36] TO BE A GOOD ONE.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; WHAT? He knows.
[1:07:40] I'm sorry, BUT THEM BRICKS JUST CAN'T
[1:07:42] STICK OUT EVERY ONCE IN A while in the
[1:07:44] wall. THE CUSTOMERS SAY, "HEY, WHY IS
[1:07:46] THAT ONE STICKING OUT?" I'VE LAID I'VE
[1:07:48] I'm a mason myself.
[1:07:51] Labored for laid block many many times.
[1:07:55] But anyway,
[1:07:57] that's right. YOU GOT TO BASICALLY KNOW
[1:07:59] WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; AND BE GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO.
[1:08:06] I REMEMBER TIM THOMPSON some time ago
[1:08:08] when we was building his little garage
[1:08:10] there that he keeps his fancy cars in it
[1:08:12] and he built a 1960s Chevron station I
[1:08:16] believe it was or Texico one of those
[1:08:18] and he had the pumps out there and he
[1:08:20] built it all and oh just spent Bukus and
[1:08:23] money on a Texico and me and Micah
[1:08:24] helped build that thing and he ordered
[1:08:27] metal and uh you know and and the guy
[1:08:30] GOT IT WRONG TWICE. NO, I WANT TO I told
[1:08:33] you what he he was finally and Timmy's a
[1:08:36] very long-suffering man. One of the best
[1:08:38] men to work for that I ever worked for.
[1:08:40] Amen. But he got frustrated with the
[1:08:42] guy. HE SAYS, "I JUST DO YOUR JOB. JUST
[1:08:44] DO YOUR JOB.
[1:08:48] THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING." YOU KNOW, if you
[1:08:50] do your if you're in business, you you
[1:08:53] got to get it right sometime.
[1:08:56] Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Are you reading between the lines? Are
[1:08:59] you listening to me now? How many know
[1:09:02] that God gets it right?
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE'S GOOD AT WHAT HE DOES.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And Jesus WAS HERE TO FULFILL THE
[1:09:17] FATHER'S WILL.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS ABOUT THE FATHER'S BUSINESS.
[1:09:27] So what is his business? Let me let me
[1:09:30] stop here. here just a little bit
[1:09:31] further. Now,
[1:09:33] if you listen to brother Bannon and what
[1:09:35] he says about it, he he'll say that this
[1:09:37] was actually a rebuke to his mother.
[1:09:42] First of all, his mother absolutely
[1:09:46] shattered her testimony.
[1:09:51] And there's another thing that I'm
[1:09:54] wondering about kind of considering and
[1:09:56] looking at because a lot of times the
[1:09:57] Bible calls the mother of god the mother
[1:09:59] of Jesus.
[1:10:02] That right there's different places
[1:10:04] where he calls it and so forth. But
[1:10:10] brother Brandon brings it out and said
[1:10:11] that Jesus never called her mother.
[1:10:15] Never called Joseph his father.
[1:10:20] Why?
[1:10:22] Because to be his mother, she would have
[1:10:25] had to supply A PORTION OF HERSELF, THE
[1:10:29] EGG. Isn't that right? Amen. And Joseph,
[1:10:32] in order to be the dad, how many knows
[1:10:35] that if a woman cheats on her husband,
[1:10:39] Amen. And and HE EVER HAS A QUESTION
[1:10:41] ABOUT WHETHER THAT BABY, THEY CAN GET A
[1:10:43] genetic test and find out whether it is
[1:10:45] or not.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND IF YOU WOULD TAKE A GENETICS
[1:10:49] test of Jesus, YOU'D FIND OUT JOSEPH WAS
[1:10:52] NOT HIS father and Mary is not his
[1:10:57] mother.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Why? THIS IS WHAT BROTHER BRANDON BRINGS
[1:11:00] OUT THAT THAT SHE WAS NOT. SHE WAS THE
[1:11:03] INCUBATOR. SHE WAS THE ONE THAT BIRTHED
[1:11:04] HIM. SHE'S THE ONE THAT MOTHERTHERED
[1:11:06] HIM, SO TO SPEAK. BUT AS FAR AS BEING
[1:11:08] THE MOTHER, SHE WAS NOT. CUZ IF THERE
[1:11:10] WAS A LITTLE BIT OF IN THERE, YOU WERE
[1:11:13] IN TROUBLE. I WAS IN TROUBLE. IF THERE'S
[1:11:16] A LITTLE BIT OF JOSEPH in there, you are
[1:11:18] not redeemed. YOU ARE NOT SAVED BECAUSE
[1:11:20] THEY WERE BORN OF SIN.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY GLAD THAT HE WAS THE BLOOD OF
[1:11:26] GOD?
[1:11:27] It was the GENE SEED OF GOD THAT COME
[1:11:30] DOWN IN HER. THE HOLY GHOST OVERSHADOWED
[1:11:32] HER, overshadowed her. But the MAN SAYS
[1:11:35] SHE TRIED IN FRONT OF THOSE PRIESTS.
[1:11:37] DIDN'T WANT TO SAY, YOU KNOW, THAT IT
[1:11:39] WAS THE HOLY GHOST CHILD BORN OF THE
[1:11:42] HOLY GHOST. SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HER
[1:11:44] TESTIMONY THERE. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT HE
[1:11:47] SAID. BUT REALISTICALLY,
[1:11:50] HE WAS CORRECTING HER. I'M ABOUT MY
[1:11:53] FATHER'S BUSINESS, AND IT AIN'T JOSEPH.
[1:11:56] AMEN. MY FATHER IS GOD, THE PILLAR OF
[1:12:00] FIRE, THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:07] OH, HOW MANY KNOWS THE BEGINNING? HE WAS
[1:12:09] THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION OF GOD.
[1:12:11] THE BIBLE SAYS, AMEN. When that was
[1:12:14] spoken, he was the beginning that God
[1:12:17] was creating something. He was going to
[1:12:19] do A WORK AND JESUS WORK. AMEN. WHEN HE
[1:12:22] CAME TO PILATE, REMEMBER PILATE SAYS, "I
[1:12:24] HAVE THE POWER TO LOSE YOU. YOU WOULDN'T
[1:12:26] HAVE NO POWER UNLESS MY FATHER HAD GIVEN
[1:12:28] IT TO ME." HE GIVEN IT TO YOU. HE SAYS,
[1:12:31] "AND HE SAID, UNTO THIS END WAS I BORN.
[1:12:35] FOR THIS PURPOSE CAME I INTO THE WORLD."
[1:12:38] HE WAS HERE TO FULFILL SCRIPTURE.
[1:12:41] FOR THE SCRIPTURE MUST be fulfilled.
[1:12:43] REMEMBER JOHN THE BAPTIST SAID, "I HAVE
[1:12:45] NEED OF BEING BAPTIZED OF THEE." AND HE
[1:12:47] SAYS, "LET IT be so. IT BEHOOVES US."
[1:12:50] BUT DOES IT BEHOOVES US TO FULFILL ALL
[1:12:53] RIGHTEOUSNESS? IN OTHER WORDS, FULFILL
[1:12:56] THE SCRIPTURE. I WANT TO SAY THIS
[1:12:57] MORNING, HOW MANY SAYS THAT WAY WITH ME?
[1:12:59] LORD, HELP US. HELP US TO FULFILL THE
[1:13:02] SCRIPTURE.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; That's what we're here for.
[1:13:11] All right, I'll calm my voice down a
[1:13:13] little bit. I'm getting a little loud.
[1:13:14] Huh?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; I get excited.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; I get a little loud.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; I was at a football game, brother Brian,
[1:13:23] and my favorite win, my favorite team
[1:13:25] would be throwing a touchdown just to
[1:13:27] get a hold of the other team. I'D
[1:13:28] PROBABLY GET UP. YEAH. YEAH.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; HUH.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; That's it. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING
[1:13:34] ABOUT. Danny Marino, Mark Clayton, Mark
[1:13:37] Dofer. Amen.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember back in my
[1:13:40] day. It's been 20 years ago. Ain't
[1:13:42] nobody remember that, Danny.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; But Danny Marino was fat. He could
[1:13:46] really throw a ball, couldn't he? And
[1:13:48] boys could really how how they won most
[1:13:50] of their games.
[1:13:52] Amen. What's that got to do with the
[1:13:55] gospel? Let me tell you what's got to do
[1:13:57] with the gospel. Brother Abraham says,
[1:13:58] you know, the the world gets excited
[1:14:00] about its things. And the believer ought
[1:14:03] to be just as enthused about the things
[1:14:05] that THEY HAVE OR MORE SO THAN WHAT THEY
[1:14:08] DO. SO IF THEY THEY GET a little loud,
[1:14:11] it don't hurt us to GET A LITTLE LOUD.
[1:14:12] IF THEY GET EXCITED, IT DON'T HURT US TO
[1:14:14] GET A LITTLE EXCITED.
[1:14:17] THIS IS TWICE AS EXCITING AS WHAT THEY
[1:14:19] ARE. They might have spend ALL THEIR
[1:14:21] TIME AND ALL THEIR money to go to THE
[1:14:23] GAME ONLY TO WATCH IT JUST TO ABSOLUTELY
[1:14:26] GET STOPPED AT THE ONE YARD LINE AND
[1:14:28] HAVE TO GO HOME. OH MAN.
[1:14:32] GO HOME IN THE agony of defeat.
[1:14:35] WE ALMOST ONE DAY WHOOPED US. OH MAN.
[1:14:40] AMEN. But here you don't have to worry
[1:14:42] about going home today in the agony of
[1:14:44] defeat. AMEN. AMEN. BUT IN THE THRILL OF
[1:14:47] VICTORY.
[1:14:52] AMEN. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Next scripture I want to go
[1:15:02] to is in St. John.
[1:15:06] I didn't bring you. I did.
[1:15:10] Oh man, I left another one on. That's
[1:15:13] just like me. All right.
[1:15:23] There we go.
[1:15:28] All right.
[1:15:30] So, let me see where you're at.
[1:15:33] In the meanwhile, when his disciples
[1:15:35] prayed, saying, "Master,
[1:15:38] eat."
[1:15:40] Amen.
[1:15:42] Next one. But as he sat, BUT HE SAID
[1:15:46] UNTO THEM, "I HAVE MEAT TO EAT THAT you
[1:15:50] know NOT OF."
[1:15:52] THEREFORE SAID THE DISCIPLES ONE TO
[1:15:54] ANOTHER, HAS ANY man brought him ought
[1:15:57] to eat?
[1:15:59] Jesus saith to him, MY MEAT IS TO DO THE
[1:16:02] WILL OF HIM that sent me.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; How many CAN REPEAT WITH ME? MY MEAT IS
[1:16:09] TO DO THE WILL OF HIM THAT SENT ME.
[1:16:13] YOUNG PEOPLE, GOD SENDS YOU HERE FOR A
[1:16:15] PURPOSE, FOR A REASON. HE'S GOT A WILL
[1:16:18] FOR YOU.
[1:16:20] AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO LIVE FOR.
[1:16:22] THAT'S MORE THAT'S BETTER THAN ANY
[1:16:25] RIBEYE, ANY KIND OF A STEAK. AMEN. IS
[1:16:27] MORE SATISFYING THAN ANYTHING YOU'LL
[1:16:30] EVER EAT. Is to be able to accomplish
[1:16:33] that right there. My meat is to do the
[1:16:35] will of him that sent me. And to finish
[1:16:38] the work.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; How many knows in a business everybody
[1:16:42] got to do a LITTLE WORK?
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; IT'S A JOB THAT WE GOT TO DO. HOW MANY
[1:16:47] BELIEVE WE GOT A JOB TO DO? HOW MANY
[1:16:50] BELIEVE WE'RE HERE TO FINISH THE JOB
[1:16:52] THAT GOD STARTED?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT IS IT TO DO? TO BRING EVERY
[1:16:57] SON BACK TO GOD. TO BRING RECONCILIATION
[1:17:02] of his lost children
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; to himself.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Next one. Let me see here. Keep on
[1:17:10] going.
[1:17:12] All right.
[1:17:17] Say not ye, there are yet four months,
[1:17:21] and then COMETH THE HARVEST. BEHOLD, I
[1:17:24] SAY UNTO YOU, LIFT UP YOUR EYES, AND
[1:17:26] LOOK ON THE FIELDS, FOR THEY ARE WHITE
[1:17:29] ALREADY TO HARVEST.
[1:17:32] And he that reapeth re RECEIVETH WAGES,
[1:17:35] AND GATHERTH FRUIT UNTO ETERNAL LIFE,
[1:17:38] THAT BOTH HE THAT SWETH AND HE THAT
[1:17:40] REAPETH MAY REJOICE TOGETHER.
[1:17:44] HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE
[1:17:45] BEEN CALLED TO? NEXT ONE.
[1:17:48] AND HEREIN IS THAT SAYING TRUE? ONE
[1:17:51] SWEETHTH, another reapeth.
[1:17:54] I SEND YOU TO REAP, WHEREUPON YE HAVE
[1:17:57] BESTOWED NO LABOR. OTHER MEN LABORED and
[1:18:02] are into, and we are entered into their
[1:18:06] laborers.
[1:18:08] Laborers.
[1:18:10] Amen.
[1:18:17] Boy, that's deep.
[1:18:21] That's deep.
[1:18:23] I HAVE SENT YOU to reap WHERE ON YE
[1:18:28] BESTO BES BESTOWED NO LABOR.
[1:18:35] HOW MANY KNOWS WHEN JESUS WAS HERE, HE
[1:18:38] WAS LABORING.
[1:18:41] HE BECAME A SERVANT.
[1:18:46] And when you're BORN AGAIN, LET ME TALK
[1:18:47] TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE BORN AGAIN, WHO
[1:18:50] HAVE GOT THE HOLY SPIRIT. GOD HAS CALLED
[1:18:53] YOU INTO HIS SERVICE.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; HE HAS CALLED YOU TO DO A JOB.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; HE HAS BROUGHT YOU INTO HIS BUSINESS.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN JESUS WAS HERE, HE DID HIS
[1:19:13] BUSINESS AND HE DID IT GOOD.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; He labored.
[1:19:20] HE WORKED HARD. HE SUFFERED.
[1:19:24] He paved the way.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVES IN NOW WE ARE
[1:19:30] beneficiaries
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; of what he labored for?
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:42] When you think about it,
[1:19:49] I guess there's still people in the
[1:19:51] Philippines and other countries where
[1:19:53] every Easter they'll go get a whip and
[1:19:55] they'll whip themselves on the back.
[1:19:57] They'll lash themselves.
[1:20:06] People do all kinds of things.
[1:20:09] In the Catholic religion, they rub on
[1:20:11] these beads and pray to Mary and do ALL
[1:20:13] THESE WORKS, DO ALL OF THESE THINGS.
[1:20:16] HOW MANY KNOWS THAT DOESN'T DO THEM ONE
[1:20:18] BIT OF GOOD? IF ANYTHING, IT'S AN INSULT
[1:20:21] TO what Jesus did.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Why? BECAUSE HE TOOK YOUR LASHES. HE
[1:20:26] WENT TO CALVARY. HE PAVED THAT ROAD. HE
[1:20:30] DID THE WORK. ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS
[1:20:32] RECEIVE IT. JUST COME ON IN AND ENTER
[1:20:34] IN.
[1:20:36] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; You received the things that Amen. that
[1:20:39] that that you DIDN'T EVEN LABOR FOR THAT
[1:20:42] YOU didn't work for.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. You couldn't DO ANYTHING
[1:20:50] TO BUY YOUR pay you for your sins.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; For a pure conscience.
[1:20:59] Amen. He labored so that you and I could
[1:21:02] HAVE FORGIVENESS. THAT'S THE FATHER'S
[1:21:04] BUSINESS.
[1:21:05] That was Christ's business
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; was to GO TO CALVARY AND TO PAY FOR OUR
[1:21:10] DEBT.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; You think about it and I'm going to stop
[1:21:18] there. Just go slow, not go so fast.
[1:21:22] THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS.
[1:21:25] WELL, let me just pick this right up as
[1:21:26] it comes to my mind. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT
[1:21:28] Brother Bam and and Sister Hope or not
[1:21:31] Hope so much but me?
[1:21:34] HOW MUCH THEY THE CHILDREN SOMETIMES
[1:21:36] DIDN'T BARELY KNOW BROTHER BRANDHAM WHEN
[1:21:38] HE WOULD COME back
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; and he had TO REACQUAINT HIMSELF WITH
[1:21:41] HIM ALMOST SOMETIMES
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; HE'D BE GONE SO MUCH
[1:21:46] SACRIFICE labored
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; amen so that you what do you do all you
[1:21:53] have to do is believe it all you got to
[1:21:55] do is receive it
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN HOW MANY'S GLAD for that
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen Amen. I send you to reap that
[1:22:06] whereupon you have bestowed no labor.
[1:22:09] Other men labored.
[1:22:13] Jesus labored
[1:22:15] in the father's business in the garden
[1:22:18] of Gethsemane
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; on Calvary.
[1:22:24] My God, MY GOD, WHY HAS THOU FORSAKEN
[1:22:26] ME? ALL OF HUMANITY FORSAKEN.
[1:22:33] Can you imagine having a worldwide
[1:22:36] ministry
[1:22:37] with the whole weight of the whole uh
[1:22:40] world on your shoulders
[1:22:43] and THEN HAVE ABOUT 12 FOLLOWERS about
[1:22:46] 12 disciples
[1:22:48] and in THE END EVEN THEY RUN highway
[1:22:53] you ain't EVEN GOT THEM LEFT TO STAND
[1:22:55] WITH YOU. HOW MANY KNOW WHEN CHRIST WENT
[1:22:57] TO CALVARY, HE WENT ALONE.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; They had all forsaken me. THEY WERE
[1:23:02] SCARED OF GOING TO THE CROSS.
[1:23:07] AMEN.
[1:23:13] Another scripture.
[1:23:16] No, let me stop.
[1:23:20] Going to fast.
[1:23:28] How many enjoys light?
[1:23:31] How many likes to
[1:23:34] just come over here and just flip a
[1:23:38] switch?
[1:23:40] It's all you got to do.
[1:23:42] You get to enjoy light.
[1:23:47] But who was it? Thomas. Isn't that
[1:23:49] right? EDISON LABOR DAY AND NIGHT.
[1:23:53] THOUSANDS OF WIRE WORKED HARD TO FIGURE
[1:23:55] OUT HOW IT'S DONE.
[1:23:58] AMEN. SO MUCH WENT INTO IT. I don't KNOW
[1:24:01] ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M GLAD THAT WE AIN'T
[1:24:03] GOT TO GO UP HERE AND CHANGE THEM ALL
[1:24:04] THE TIME. I GUESS BROTHER BRIAN CHANGED
[1:24:06] ALL THOSE LIGHTS TO WHAT LED.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He's glad that he ain't got to
[1:24:10] bring that big old LADDER IN HERE AND
[1:24:12] CHANGE THEM ALL THE TIME. ALL THE LIGHTS
[1:24:13] ARE OUT AGAIN. THEY GO BLOWING ALL THE
[1:24:16] TIME. BUT NOW MY I'VE HAD MINE IN MY
[1:24:18] HOUSE SEVEN YEARS, I GUESS, AND I STILL
[1:24:20] AIN'T HAD TO DO WOO! I'M GLAD FOR
[1:24:22] LIGHTS.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; But yet, I didn't come up with it. I
[1:24:27] didn't work on it. I didn't figure OUT
[1:24:28] HOW TO MAKE LEDS, BUT I GET TO ENJOY IT.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; I was going to say, "HOW MANY HOW MANY
[1:24:35] ENJOY YOUR AIR CONDITIONER IN your
[1:24:38] vehicle?"
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Well, if I ask them
[1:24:42] that, they'll say, "Not really right
[1:24:43] now. I like the heater better.
[1:24:48] by fixing to tomorrow. If you don't
[1:24:50] think about it today, in the next few
[1:24:52] days, we're going to have the old winter
[1:24:53] back again. Hallelujah. I like cold
[1:24:56] weather.
[1:24:58] Amen.
[1:25:01] I know you want to talk. Say, I like the
[1:25:03] war. I I hear you. I hear you.
[1:25:08] But what is it somebody had to figure
[1:25:11] out so that you can BE COMFORTABLE?
[1:25:15] I'M glad that Jesus figured IT OUT SO
[1:25:17] THAT YOU COULD HAVE SOME COMFORT. YOU
[1:25:20] CAN HAVE THE COMFORT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:25:23] AMEN. THAT YOU DIDN'T LABOR FOR IT.
[1:25:25] JESUS LABORED FOR IT. HE WORKED TO BRING
[1:25:28] IT TO YOU. WE can do is accept it.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; They've got something called opium now.
[1:25:43] Amen. I don't know what them P go folks
[1:25:47] gave my wife one time when her heart was
[1:25:48] fluttering. It was hurting. I took her
[1:25:50] in. They couldn't figure out what it
[1:25:51] was, but they gave her some opium or
[1:25:53] something. They gave her some good hard
[1:25:54] drugs.
[1:25:57] Now, my wife don't do drugs, believe me.
[1:26:00] One little Tylenol, they'll just do
[1:26:02] whatever. But they her medicine, she did
[1:26:03] what the doctor said, and when she got
[1:26:05] home, she was feeling mighty fine.
[1:26:15] So much so she laid on some laundry. I
[1:26:17] said, "HOW YOU DOING?" "OH, I'M just
[1:26:19] fine."
[1:26:23] I shouldn't say this. There she is
[1:26:25] covering her face. Lord help.
[1:26:30] But that's right. What did they do? THEY
[1:26:32] COME UP WITH THESE DRUGS. AMEN. TO GIVE
[1:26:34] YOU SOME SOME SOME ACTUALLY A GOOD
[1:26:37] FEELING. MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD. IF YOU'RE

[1:26:43] COME DOWN? AMEN. IN CHRIST AND HE
[1:26:46] CRUSHED JESUS WHICH WAS THE LILY OF THE
[1:26:49] VALLEY AND HE BROUGHT US SOME OPIUM SO
[1:26:51] THAT IF YOU'RE TALKING LOW YOU CAN SAY
[1:26:53] NO I FEEL JUST FINE

[1:27:11] TOO. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED MORE OF. AMEN.
[1:27:13] IT'S THAT opium from the lily of the
[1:27:15] valley.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY GLAD FOR THE BAPTISM OF THE
[1:27:20] HOLY GHOST?
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; JESUS WENT TO CALVARY SO THAT YOU COULD
[1:27:24] HAVE THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST.

[1:27:49] up, I've got a few potholes down the
[1:27:51] driveway and I try to avoid the
[1:27:52] potholes. I don't want to get it all

[1:29:56] till Jesus comes. will work till Jesus
[1:30:00] comes and then we'll be gathered home.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:07] We've been called to labor, to work, to
[1:30:10] testify,
[1:30:12] to bring this to the world.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:16] Let me just say it while I'm at. How
[1:30:17] many knows that the church has been
[1:30:19] given the commission to carry on the
[1:30:22] father's business?
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before we get into that part, I
[1:30:28] want to read you another scripture
[1:30:42] in Luke 4. Now this is Jesus
[1:30:49] after he uh let me see according to
[1:30:52] verse 23 of chapter 3 it says and Jesus
[1:30:55] himself began to be about 30 years of
[1:30:59] age
[1:31:00] being as was supposed I like that as was
[1:31:05] supposed to be the son of Joseph. Amen.
[1:31:09] Just because he was supposed to be don't
[1:31:11] mean he was. Amen.
[1:31:14] But over in chapter 4 and we'll make a
[1:31:17] long story short. Go down to verse 14.
[1:31:19] And Jesus returned. This was after the
[1:31:22] temptation temp when he went up in the
[1:31:24] mountains was temptation of the devil
[1:31:25] and so forth. Tempted of him and so
[1:31:27] forth.
[1:31:29] Amen. Come back victorious.
[1:31:33] And when the devil had ended all the
[1:31:35] temptations, he departed from him for a
[1:31:37] season. And Jesus returned in the power
[1:31:38] of the spirit unto Galilee. And there
[1:31:41] went out a fame of him throughout all
[1:31:42] the regions round about. And he taught
[1:31:44] in their synagogues, being glorified of
[1:31:46] all. And he came to Nazareth where he
[1:31:49] had been brought up. And as his custom
[1:31:53] was,
[1:31:57] Amen. You know, that little word custom
[1:31:59] kind of catches my attention.
[1:32:06] Brother Bram said, you know, just make
[1:32:07] it a habit to pray. Make it a habit. Can
[1:32:11] we say just make it a habit to come to
[1:32:13] church.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; It's just what you do. It's your custom.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; It may be a little ritualistic or
[1:32:19] whatever, but it's our custom and that's
[1:32:21] what we do.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; It was his custom.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:28] And he went into the synagogue on the
[1:32:30] Sabbath day and stood up for it to read.
[1:32:33] And there was delivered unto him the
[1:32:34] book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he
[1:32:37] had opened the book, he found the place
[1:32:39] where it was written, "The spirit of the
[1:32:42] Lord is upon me because he has anointed
[1:32:45] me to preach the gospel TO THE POOR. HE
[1:32:48] HAS SENT ME TO HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED,
[1:32:52] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:32:54] and the RECOVERING OF THE SIGHT OF THE
[1:32:56] BLIND." AMEN. How many believe WE NEED
[1:32:59] SOME SPIRITUAL EYESIGHT?
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AND TO SET AT LIBERTY THEM
[1:33:04] THAT ARE BROKEN
[1:33:12] IS TO HEAL. AMEN. IS TO FORGIVE. IT'S TO
[1:33:15] BRING OUT OF THE OUT OF THE PAWN SHOP TO
[1:33:18] BRING DELIVERANCE TO THE CAPTIVES. IF
[1:33:20] YOU'RE A CAPTIVE, GOD'S STILL IN THE
[1:33:22] BUSINESS. IF YOU'RE A SINNER, GOD'S
[1:33:24] STILL IN THE BUSINESS. IF YOU NEED THE
[1:33:26] REAL FILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, GOD IS
[1:33:29] STILL IN THE BUSINESS.
[1:33:33] OH, I NEED MORE OF THE HOLY GHOST. GOD
[1:33:36] IS STILL IN THE BUSINESS.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; I need victory in THE IN MY LIFE. THAT'S
[1:33:41] WHAT HE DOES.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; WOO! I LIKE THAT. THAT'S WHAT GOD DOES.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll say it before I don't. That's
[1:33:53] what this church is in the BUSINESS FOR.
[1:33:56] WHAT'S OUR BUSINESS? What do we do? WE
[1:33:59] LIKE TO PREACH THE GOSPEL. HE SAYS WHEN
[1:34:02] JESUS COMMISSIONED TO THE CHURCH AND
[1:34:04] WHEN HE HANDED IT OVER TO THE CHURCH,
[1:34:07] how many believes that the work, the
[1:34:10] business was handed over to the church?
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; It was given to the church to do.
[1:34:17] Cuz when Jesus hung on the cross, he
[1:34:21] said, "My job is done."
[1:34:24] He said, "It's finished.
[1:34:27] It's finished.
[1:34:29] Amen.
[1:34:31] It's finished. His work here on earth in
[1:34:34] his body was finished. Amen. On earth.
[1:34:39] After that, where did he go? Went on
[1:34:42] down to hell. Went to the grave. Had a
[1:34:46] little more work to do down there. After
[1:34:48] he rose up again, he had had to go on up
[1:34:51] to heaven, sit at the right hand of the
[1:34:53] father of authority.
[1:34:56] Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; So
[1:35:08] no doubt but Jesus opened the eyes of
[1:35:10] the blind. Is that right? No doubt but
[1:35:13] that he
[1:35:15] CALLED LAZARUS BACK FROM THE DEAD. HE
[1:35:18] RAISED THE DEAD UP.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; OPEN THE EYES of the blind.
[1:35:25] But there's some things he couldn't do.
[1:35:28] There's some things Jesus couldn't do.
[1:35:29] Even though the eyes were open.
[1:35:32] Amen. Takes spit and open and people be
[1:35:34] healed and all of that. But there was a
[1:35:37] much greater work that was to be done.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; And it couldn't be done as long as he
[1:35:44] was on THE EARTH. THAT'S WHY HE SAID
[1:35:46] IT'S EXPEDIENT THAT I GO AWAY.
[1:35:50] We need a little music with the
[1:35:51] preaching. It'll be all right.
[1:35:55] BECAUSE IF I DON'T GO AWAY, THE
[1:35:57] COMFORTER CAN'T COME. I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
[1:35:59] OPEN YOUR EYES. I MIGHT JUST SAY, "COME
[1:36:01] UNTO ME." BUT YOU CAN NEVER COME UNTIL
[1:36:04] MY HOLY SPIRIT COMES DOWN UPON YOU. YOU
[1:36:07] CAN NEVER OVERCOME SIN. YOU CAN NEVER
[1:36:09] OVERCOME YOUR NATURE. PETER, YOU'RE
[1:36:12] CONVERTED. Even he COULDN'T BE
[1:36:13] CONVERTED. PETER COULDN'T OVERCOME.
[1:36:16] NO, BECAUSE HE WAS STILL IN THAT FIRST
[1:36:18] NATURE. GOD CAME TO DO A WORK.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; That is TO GIVE US SOMETHING THAT WE
[1:36:24] LOST AT THE BEGINNING WHEN ADAM AND EVE
[1:36:27] WHEN THEY WERE HERE, THEY WERE SUPPOSED
[1:36:28] TO SPEAK THE WORD AND CREATE THEIR
[1:36:30] CHILDREN.
[1:36:32] But they went THE WRONG WAY. SO NOW IT'S
[1:36:34] THROUGH CHILDBEARING. AMEN. BUT GOD WAS
[1:36:36] GOING TO COME DOWN AND HE'S GOING TO
[1:36:38] START A NEW CREATION. AND HIS BUSINESS
[1:36:41] WAS TO CREATE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:36:43] AMEN. AND IN THAT UPPER ROOM, IT WAS THE
[1:36:45] FIRST BATCH THAT AMEN. THAT WAS BORN
[1:36:47] INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; He says when you're converted,
[1:36:56] feed my sheep. Is
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; that right? FEED MY SHEEP.
[1:37:00] AMEN. WE ALL HAVE A WORK TO DO.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I never finished my thought on the
[1:37:04] evening light tabernacle,
[1:37:06] but my work. How many believe that each
[1:37:09] one of us has a work?
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; God gives us something to do.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT HE SAID, "PETER, FEED MY
[1:37:15] SHEEP. FEED MY SHEEP. I THOUGHT, YOU
[1:37:17] KNOW, I'VE NEVER DONE MUCH MISSIONARY
[1:37:18] WORK. Tried to maybe try to convert some
[1:37:21] folks up in OHIO THIS OR THE OTHER, BUT
[1:37:23] MY CALLING IS TO FEED GOD'S SHEEP.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE I'M DOING WHAT GOD HAS CALLED
[1:37:28] ME TO DO, AND I WILL DO IT AS LONG AS
[1:37:31] GOD GIVES ME STRENGTH.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Feed my sheep.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Called
[1:37:47] So the point I was trying to make there
[1:37:50] was that
[1:37:52] redemption wasn't while brother whether
[1:37:55] Jesus while Jesus was here on earth.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We needed the Holy Ghost.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew how important it was for
[1:38:03] PETER TO HAVE THE STRENGTH. AMEN. THE
[1:38:06] NEXT TIME WHEN HE GETS THE BAPTISM IN
[1:38:07] THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. AND THEY'RE FIXED
[1:38:10] TO CRUCIFY AND HE WALKS OUT OF TOWN.
[1:38:12] JESUS COMES AND SAYS, "HEY, I'M GOING."
[1:38:14] HE PASSED HIM, "I'M GOING TO BE
[1:38:16] CRUCIFIED AGAIN, NOT AGAIN." AIN'T THAT
[1:38:18] RIGHT? AND PETER WENT BACK AND HE SAID,
[1:38:20] "HANG ME UPSIDE DOWN. CRUCIFY ME UPSIDE
[1:38:23] DOWN. I'M NOT WORTHY TO DIE LIKE MY LORD
[1:38:26] DID." HE WAS A BRAVE SOLDIER THEN.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; SO, let me SAY THIS THAT IT WAS AFTER,
[1:38:32] AMEN. CHRIST DIED, ROSE AGAIN, WHEN THE
[1:38:34] REDEMPTION, THE TRUE RECONCILIATION OF
[1:38:37] THE FATHER, WHAT HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO
[1:38:39] ACCOMPLISH HAPPENED ON THE DAY OF
[1:38:41] PENTECOST.
[1:38:43] WOO! MAN WAS RECONCILED TO GOD. JESUS
[1:38:46] BRIDGED THE WAY FOR MAN TO COME BACK TO
[1:38:49] GOD. AND THEY CAME BACK BY THE DROVES.
[1:38:52] AND THEY'RE STILL COMING. AND THEY'LL
[1:38:54] COME UNTIL THAT LAST ONE COMES IN.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; You and I have got the job of trying to
[1:39:02] find that last one.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:39:06] Jesus said, "GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD
[1:39:09] AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE.
[1:39:12] He that BELIEVETH AND IS BAPTIZED SHALL
[1:39:14] BE SAVED. HE THAT BELIEVETH NOT SHALL BE
[1:39:16] DAMNED."
[1:39:17] AMEN. SO THE CHURCH HAS BEEN THE
[1:39:19] COMMISSION. WE HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONED BY
[1:39:21] GOD
[1:39:23] to carry out
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; his work.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; 12 times I pulled up that quote where
[1:39:29] brother Bam says that God gave church.
[1:39:32] Amen. The business his business. Amen.
[1:39:34] We're about to do his business. I have
[1:39:37] one quote here I want to read
[1:39:40] that brother Brandon made as we go into
[1:39:42] the next step.
[1:39:50] Listen,
[1:39:52] how many know that Jesus came
[1:39:55] to fulfill the scriptures? He came to do
[1:39:59] the will of the father that had sent me
[1:40:02] sent him. Brother B makes a statement.
[1:40:04] Those in the bride do only his will.
[1:40:09] No one can make them do otherwise. They
[1:40:12] have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep
[1:40:15] still.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; They know it HAS TO BE GOD IN THEM DOING
[1:40:18] the works, fulfilling his own word.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. JESUS SAYS, "I AM THE light of THE
[1:40:24] WORLD." BUT HE ALSO SAYS, "YE ARE THE
[1:40:26] LIGHT OF THE WORLD."
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; GOD HELP US TO LET OUR LIGHT SHINE.
[1:40:31] Whose
[1:40:36] glasses?
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:41] But Abam says it this way.
[1:40:44] They know that it has to be God in them
[1:40:46] doing the works, fulfilling his own
[1:40:47] word. Now, he did not complete all his
[1:40:52] works while in his earthly ministry.
[1:40:57] Amen.
[1:40:59] Why? If that had been the case, we'd
[1:41:01] have altars after Calvary taking us
[1:41:03] home. But we still needed redemption. We
[1:41:06] still needed to hear the gospel.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Me and my wife was talking on the way to
[1:41:13] church
[1:41:16] of it just being four days away from
[1:41:19] being 2026.
[1:41:21] She said she remembered, and I don't
[1:41:23] know it was 1977 or not. I'm pretty sure
[1:41:25] it probably was. She remembers when she
[1:41:27] was young sitting in some kind of a a
[1:41:30] room. I forget what she described it as,
[1:41:33] like a cafeteria or something with a lot
[1:41:35] of chairs and everybody in the church
[1:41:37] was there. And as the 12:00 time came,
[1:41:41] maybe five or so minutes before,
[1:41:43] everybody just sat there and watched the
[1:41:47] clock tick.
[1:41:50] That's what she said. They just sat
[1:41:52] quiet. Nobody talked. Nobody prayed. He
[1:41:54] says, "Watch the clock."
[1:41:56] Tick tock, tick tock. Why? Because how
[1:41:59] many knows expect people was expecting
[1:42:01] 1977?
[1:42:03] The millennium will be here. He
[1:42:05] predicted it would be all over with. But
[1:42:07] then,
[1:42:08] Amen.
[1:42:10] I thought, you know, I'm sure glad it
[1:42:13] wasn't. I didn't get saved till 83. How
[1:42:16] many here would say, I'M GLAD IT WASN'T
[1:42:18] OVER, Brother Hervin AND MARTHA? I'M
[1:42:21] GLAD IT WASN'T OVER, TOMMY, TAMMY, TROY.
[1:42:24] I'M GLAD IT WASN'T OVER. I WOULDN'T HAVE
[1:42:26] MADE IT.
[1:42:28] COME ON, PEOPLE. AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT IT
[1:42:30] WASN'T? That you could still COME IN,
[1:42:33] GOD, WITH LONG SUFFERING.
[1:42:37] I AM SO GLAD CUZ I'D have been lost.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. The work wasn't done yet. Amen.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; People after the seals were open said,
[1:42:50] "Should we go preach?"
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; WHY, SURE.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE Brother Brandon
[1:42:56] believed in preachers?
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; He sure did.
[1:43:01] AMEN. GO. DON'T STOP. NOW, THERE'S STILL
[1:43:03] WORK TO BE DONE.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:09] He works. Now, notice.
[1:43:12] So his EARTHLY MINISTERS KNOW NOW HE
[1:43:14] WORKS in and through the bride.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; She knows that for it IS WAS NOT YET
[1:43:20] TIME FOR HIM to do certain things.
[1:43:24] I mean believes that's the truth.
[1:43:26] St. JOHN 16:12 SAYS, "I HAVE YET MANY
[1:43:29] THINGS to say unto you, but you cannot
[1:43:31] bear them now. How be it when he, THE
[1:43:34] SPIRIT OF TRUTH, IS COME, HE WILL GUIDE
[1:43:37] YOU INTO ALL TRUTH."
[1:43:40] HOW MANY BELIEVES HE DIDN'T SAY AS MUCH
[1:43:42] AS HE WANTED TO SAY?
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; NO, HE DIDN'T SAY NEAR AS MUCH AS WHAT
[1:43:48] he wanted to say.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; You know how much he said? You know how
[1:43:52] much Jesus said?
[1:43:55] Jesus said Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[1:44:00] John.
[1:44:02] About how many knows God needed a Paul?
[1:44:06] God needed A PAUL THAT COULD SAY THAT
[1:44:10] ALL SCRIPTURE IS GIVEN BY INSPIRATION OF
[1:44:12] GOD. IT'S PROFITABLE DOCTRINE FOR
[1:44:14] REPROVE FOR INSTRUCTION IN
[1:44:16] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:44:17] AMEN.
[1:44:19] MAN LIKE PAUL THAT COULD COME AND preach
[1:44:23] the word OF GOD AND SAY IF ANYBODY COME
[1:44:25] AND PREACH ANY OTHER GOSPEL THAN THAT
[1:44:27] WHICH WE HAVE PREACHED IF HE'S AN ANGEL
[1:44:28] FROM HEAVEN. WHY? MORE TRUTH WAS to
[1:44:32] come.
[1:44:36] more truth was to come. There was more
[1:44:39] work to be done.
[1:44:43] Now notice,
[1:44:46] it was not yet time for him to do
[1:44:47] certain things that he must do now do,
[1:44:50] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:44:52] bride the work which he left for a
[1:44:56] specific time.
[1:45:00] Amen.
[1:45:04] How many believe you should always be
[1:45:05] missionary-minded,
[1:45:07] always reaching out for the lost?
[1:45:10] God help evening like tabernacle. If the
[1:45:12] preachers ever get to where they're
[1:45:14] stagnated and the Holy Spirit's not
[1:45:16] working anymore, we'll just talk about
[1:45:18] the robins that come back in the
[1:45:19] springtime and the nice little flowers
[1:45:21] or something.
[1:45:23] Didn't what Brother Bam said churches
[1:45:25] all they can talk about is some flowers.
[1:45:26] THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE A MESSAGE. NO,
[1:45:28] BUT IT TAKES THE FIRE OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:45:33] TO NOT JUST BE HERE, NOT JUST BURN HERE,
[1:45:36] BUT BURN OUT THERE.
[1:45:39] I mean, THAT'S WHY WE APPRECIATE THE
[1:45:41] WORK TOMMY DOES. I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT TO
[1:45:42] GO, IF I GOT TO GO TO JAIL SOMEWHERE,
[1:45:44] I'LL CATCH THEM SOMEWHERE AND THEN
[1:45:46] PREACH TO SOMEBODY IF THEY I GOT TO
[1:45:48] CATCH HIM BEHIND BARS.
[1:45:50] I'D LIKE TO DO GO ON THE STREET CORNERS
[1:45:52] OR WHATEVER. SOMEBODY HEAR THIS. THIS IS
[1:45:55] SO GOOD. AMEN. HOW MANY BELIEVES IT'LL
[1:45:58] GO TO ALL THE WAY TO THE END?
[1:46:00] AMEN. TO ALL THE WORLD. AND WHEN ALL THE
[1:46:03] PREACHERS, THE CREATURES have heard it,
[1:46:05] brother Bam says, then the end will
[1:46:06] come. And when that last one comes in,
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; that's why we pray, Lord, lead us, guide
[1:46:11] us, help us each one.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Wherever God lights your candle and
[1:46:15] places, you shine right there.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; You in Scotsville, let Scotsville see
[1:46:21] your light. Here in Elkton, let let him
[1:46:24] see your light.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not A PREACHER. GOD TAUGHT ME
[1:46:28] TO BE A BUSINESSMAN. WELL, BE THE BEST
[1:46:29] BUSINESSMAN YOU CAN BE.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; God calls you to MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
[1:46:36] MAKE A LOT OF MONEY SUPPORTING THE
[1:46:37] CAUSE, BUT USE IT FOR THE GOSPEL AND FOR
[1:46:39] THE KINGDOM OF GOD.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; USE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY. YOU NEVER KNOW.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; GOD CALLED YOU JUST TO MAKE A LITTLE
[1:46:46] MONEY. MAYBE HE DON'T TRUST YOU WITH ALL
[1:46:48] OF THAT MONEY.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BE HAPPY. BE STAY IN THE CALLING
[1:46:52] THAT GOD HAS CALLED YOU TO BE. HOW MANY
[1:46:54] BELIEVES THAT?
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF YOU, I WANT EVERY one of
[1:46:57] YOU AS YOUR PASTOR. I WANT YOU TO FIND
[1:46:58] YOUR PLACE AND PLANT YOURSELF THERE AND
[1:47:01] KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE WILL OF GOD AND
[1:47:03] SHINE WHERE YOU ARE.
[1:47:06] We here AT EVENING NIGHT TABERNACLE,
[1:47:08] WE'RE HERE, AMEN, TO MAKE STRONG
[1:47:10] FAMILIES, TO MAKE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS,
[1:47:12] STRONG MARRIAGES, BRING UP YOUNG PEOPLE
[1:47:15] AND TO GET THEM FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[1:47:17] GHOST.
[1:47:18] CAUSE THEM MAYBE TO GET MARRIED IF
[1:47:20] THAT'S WHAT GOD CALLS THEM TO DO. HAVE
[1:47:22] CHILDREN AND RAISE THEM IN THE NURTURE
[1:47:24] AND THE ADMONITION OF GOD. THAT'S WHAT
[1:47:26] WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS FOR.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:37] To live for the Lord.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Never go out in the world. Never smoke.
[1:47:42] Never drink. Young people.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; STAY AWAY FROM IT. HAVE A TESTIMONY.
[1:47:47] I'VE NEVER TOUCHED THAT. BY THE GRACE OF
[1:47:49] GOD.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW MANY BELIEVES IT TAKES A REAL
[1:47:52] GRACE OF GOD? THAT'S A MORE POWERFUL
[1:47:54] TESTIMONY. AND HE SAYS, "YES, I WAS IN
[1:47:56] DRUGS. I WAS IN THIS, THAT, AND GOD, BUT
[1:47:58] GOD DELIVERED ME." HOW MUCH A GREATER
[1:48:00] TESTIMONY IF YOU HAD YOUR YOUNG LIFE
[1:48:02] GIVE YOUR HEART TO GOD AND NEVER EVEN
[1:48:04] GET INTO IT. SAY, "THAT'S THE POWER OF
[1:48:06] ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:48:12] That's what we want." Amen.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:19] That's our business.
[1:48:26] We're making we we like to for people to
[1:48:29] have joy.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; How many know that Jesus came that you
[1:48:33] have joy?
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; We want HE WANTS TO HAVE HIS CHILDREN TO
[1:48:38] HAVE A SMILE ON THEIR FACE.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO BE HAPPY.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW GOD WANTS YOU. THAT'S HOW I
[1:48:45] WANT YOU. THAT'S HOW I WANT TO BE. WHY?
[1:48:47] THERE'S NO REASON FOR US NOT TO BE
[1:48:49] HAPPY.
[1:48:51] NOT TO HAVE JOY.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; All right, let me take another turn.
[1:49:09] Amen.
[1:49:11] Let's find out
[1:49:13] just how
[1:49:15] God runs his business. How many like to
[1:49:17] know how God runs his business? And
[1:49:20] maybe if I have time, we'll get into the
[1:49:22] little phrase that people will say,
[1:49:24] "Well, I'm a preacher.
[1:49:27] You better stay in your own business.
[1:49:29] Stay out of my business."
[1:49:31] Huh?
[1:49:33] Stay out of my business.
[1:49:36] If I'm in your business, then I'm doing
[1:49:39] my business.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Get all up in your business
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; cuz God gets all up in our business.
[1:49:49] That's what God does.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Give him a hand. Say, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, watch that phrase, brother.
[1:50:02] You're meddling now.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Medddling.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; God likes to meddle.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, he does.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; He meddles with the way that you have
[1:50:14] your hair. He meddles with the way that
[1:50:16] you dress. He meddles with whether you
[1:50:19] have a smile or not or whether you go
[1:50:20] all droopy. HE CARES ABOUT EVERYTHING
[1:50:22] ABOUT YOU.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; HELLO. SO, I'M GLAD HE MEDDLES.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; I'M GLAD HE CARES.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; I got wrote down here meddling. Well,
[1:50:37] now you talk about hair. Our sisters and
[1:50:39] their long hair.
[1:50:42] Amen. Don't put a census to it. It's a
[1:50:44] Nazerite vow. He said, "You boys," he
[1:50:48] says, "don't act like the Beatles. Don't
[1:50:50] have these hair hanging down in your
[1:50:52] face where all you got to always just
[1:50:54] fling it, fling it, fling it, fling it
[1:50:56] like some girl." He said
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; like the Beatles did. They had these
[1:51:01] these this hair down in their eyes.
[1:51:03] Brother Brandham hated that. He said,
[1:51:04] "It's a spirit.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit."
[1:51:09] Amen. That's how they had it. Don't act
[1:51:12] like a girl. Don't have hair like a
[1:51:14] girl.
[1:51:15] Hallelujah.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Preaches on our shoes we wear. My
[1:51:20] He even cares how big a heels we got. He
[1:51:23] cares about that.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he don't WANT YOU TO
[1:51:26] WALKING AROUND LIKE THIS LIKE the
[1:51:28] harlots do out on the street.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; We won't even get into why they do that.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Be too vulgar. Hello.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; But it's a vulgar thing that they do
[1:51:39] that. SO THAT'S WHY HE SAYS THINGS LIKE
[1:51:41] THAT. YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO DO THAT.
[1:51:44] SORRY, BUT HE PUT IT ON THE SCRIPT.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. AND OF COURSE, WE DON'T
[1:51:49] BELIEVE IN WEARING PANTS AROUND HERE.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; NO, WE DON'T DO THAT. BUT GUESS WHAT? WE
[1:51:53] GOT TO CARE. BE CAREFUL. HE SAYS, MAN,
[1:51:55] YOU GET THAT SKIRT WHERE YOU FEEL AMEN.
[1:51:58] like you're you got the skin of a I call
[1:52:00] it the skin of a wiener.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. HOW MANY KNOWS A HOT DOG?
[1:52:06] AMEN. IT'S GOT SOME TIGHT SKIN.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Look like you're some wiener, you
[1:52:11] know, or whatever.
[1:52:14] That's bad, too.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or all those things you say, well,
[1:52:19] you know, THOSE ARE NO, GOD CARES ABOUT
[1:52:21] HOW YOU LOOK. YOU REPRESENT HIM,
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; NOT SOME STREET WALKER.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Ain't that the truth?
[1:52:36] GOD CARES ABOUT WHETHER YOU GO TO CHURCH
[1:52:38] OR NOT. BROTHER BAM SAYS, you know, I
[1:52:41] said, you know, SOME PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE
[1:52:43] REALLY CARE ABOUT WHETHER THOSE DOORS
[1:52:44] ARE OPEN OR NOT.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, THOUGH?
[1:52:49] THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T WAIT FOR
[1:52:51] THEM TO OPEN TO GET OUT OF HERE.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; WHEN'S THAT PREACHER GOING TO QUIT? THIS
[1:52:58] HAS BEEN TOO LONG, MAN. I CAN'T WAIT FOR
[1:53:01] THEM DOORS TO OPEN. IT'S JUST THE WRONG
[1:53:02] KIND. AMEN. YOU OUGHT TO BE SAYING, "I
[1:53:04] CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM TO OPEN, TO GET INTO
[1:53:06] THEM, NOT TO GET OUT OF THEM." I'M
[1:53:09] TELLING YOU, IF YOU CAN'T WAIT TO GET
[1:53:11] OUT OF HERE, YOU BETTER TAKE TRIP TO THE
[1:53:13] ALTAR and get A LITTLE TASTE OF this
[1:53:15] thing.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. WHAT DOES IT SAY? WHENEVER
[1:53:27] YOU GET SUFFER FOR THE S FOR THE SAKE OF
[1:53:30] CHRIST, AMEN. AMEN. REJOICE AND LEAP FOR
[1:53:33] JOY.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I THOUGHT I THOUGHT I MIGHT DO
[1:53:36] THIS, BUT I DON'T GUESS I WILL. I don't
[1:53:37] want anybody TO GET HURT. AMEN. BUT COME
[1:53:39] UP HERE AND WE'LL LINE UP. LET'S leap
[1:53:40] for joy.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT'S GOD'S
[1:53:47] BUSINESS. YES. TO BRING YOU JOY
[1:53:49] UNSPEAKABLE,
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; FULL OF GLORY. LEAP FOR JOY.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; DANCE TO HIM. SHOUT FOR HIM. I HEARD
[1:53:56] BROTHER B SAYING YESTERDAY. HE SAYS,
[1:53:58] "MAN, HE'S TO A CERTAIN CHURCH." HE
[1:54:00] SAYS, "DON'T NEVER LOSE THAT
[1:54:02] INSPIRATION. ALWAYS CLAP YOUR HANDS.
[1:54:04] ALWAYS SING TO THE LORD. SING THEM OLD
[1:54:06] GOSPEL SONGS." AMEN. NEVER LOSE IT. HOW
[1:54:09] MANY KNOWS it's so easy to lose it?
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; THOSE CHURCHES HAVE LOST IT. CAN I SAY
[1:54:14] EVENING LIGHT TABERNACLE? WE'RE NOT
[1:54:16] GOING TO LOSE IT. NO. FROM WEDNESDAY TO
[1:54:20] SUNDAY, SOMETIMES WE GET A LITTLE
[1:54:22] BACKSLID.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; HELLO. BUT IT'S NOT TIME TO DO THAT. NO.
[1:54:26] STAY in fervent prayer. Amen.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; The father's business.
[1:54:40] Are you kidding me? I am his business.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; You are his business.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; We're his business.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; He's in the soulsaving
[1:54:51] business.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; He's in the redeeming business.
[1:54:57] He's in the joybringing business. HE'S
[1:55:00] IN CLEANSING BUSINESS.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. We never COME UP WITH THAT BLEACH
[1:55:06] THAT WE GET ALL OUR SPOTS OUT OF IN OUR
[1:55:09] CLOTHES. AND WE NEVER come up with the
[1:55:10] bleach THAT WASHES US WHITE AS SNOW. BUT
[1:55:12] WE ARE THE BENEFICIARIES. ALL WE GOT TO
[1:55:15] DO IS RECEIVE IT.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:22] All right, let's make that turn that I
[1:55:24] talked about for a minute.
[1:55:28] Brother Bam says the hidden life with
[1:55:31] Christ. He says, "May I stop just a
[1:55:34] moment and realize that I'm facing
[1:55:36] clergymen,
[1:55:38] smart man. But I'd like to say this.
[1:55:42] I know and I believe this and I know it
[1:55:45] that Jesus never went to the cross and
[1:55:48] died for some haphazard affair."
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[1:55:54] Amen. And how many believes that I may
[1:55:56] get into it maybe Sunday I don't know
[1:55:58] but we could maybe talk about God the
[1:56:01] architect.
[1:56:03] How many know he's architect
[1:56:05] brother he's I got a quote here says
[1:56:07] that brother brother said that God is a
[1:56:10] contractor.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; He is a contractor. He's a businessman.
[1:56:15] Amen. And in order to and he's a
[1:56:19] builder. I want to say he's a builder.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY IT'S GOD THAT BUILDS? AMEN.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; He's a builder.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; You got time?
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; I got word.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, Jesus never went to the
[1:56:37] cross for SOME HAPHAZARD AFFAIR. PERHAPS
[1:56:40] MAYBE SOMEBODY MIGHT FEEL SORRY BECAUSE
[1:56:42] HE DIED IN such a terrible way and so
[1:56:45] they'll COME AND GET SAVED. GOD DOESN'T
[1:56:47] RUN HIS BUSINESS LIKE THAT.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; GOD RUNS HIS BUSINESS BY FORNOWLEDGE.
[1:56:54] KNOWING BEFORE THE WORLD WAS EVER FORMED
[1:56:58] WHO WAS his who's his own.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:04] SEE, IN THE CHURCH, YOU DON'T GET VOTED
[1:57:06] OUT OR voted in. YOU'RE BORN ONCE for
[1:57:10] eternity,
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; FOREVER. ONLY GOD COULD PUT YOU OUT. HE
[1:57:14] SWORE AND HE SWORE BY HIMSELF THAT HE
[1:57:16] WOULD NEVER DO IT.
[1:57:20] How many's glad for a business like
[1:57:21] that?
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful. All right.
[1:57:30] He knows. Amen. He knows what you're
[1:57:34] made out of before he brings you in.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; OH MY. THAT JUST IF THE DEVIL EVER COMES
[1:57:42] TO YOU AND TRIES TO TELL YOU, "NO, I'M
[1:57:44] NOT ONE OF GOD'S CHILDREN. NO, I'M NOT
[1:57:46] GOOD ENOUGH. OH, LOOK AT MY FAILURES."
[1:57:48] YOU REMEMBER THIS. GOD WOULDN'T CALL
[1:57:51] YOU. HE WOULDN'T BRING YOU IN IF HE
[1:57:54] WASN'T ABLE TO KEEP YOU.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; He knows what you're made out of.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before he brings you in, he don't
[1:58:08] run his business loosely like our
[1:58:11] organizations do. Well, coach, come and
[1:58:14] join church. Put your name on the book.
[1:58:19] Come here, Michael. Just come, man. You
[1:58:22] know, just come put your name on the
[1:58:24] book, shake the preacher's hand. All
[1:58:25] right, you're officially saved. I mean,
[1:58:27] you're part of the church and you're
[1:58:29] going to heaven.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? Would you accept
[1:58:33] that?
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Just because you shook the preacher's
[1:58:36] hand.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; No. Thank you, brother.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; No. No.
[1:58:44] I like what brother Bram WHEN HE
[1:58:45] PREACHED. HE MUST BE BORN AGAIN. NOT
[1:58:48] JUST SHAKE THE PREACHER'S HAND. YOU'VE
[1:58:50] got the boohoo. YOU'VE GOT THE CRY. YOU
[1:58:52] GOT TO PICK YOUR WAY OUT OF THAT EGG.
[1:58:54] AMEN. UNTIL THERE'S A BIRTH THAT COMES
[1:58:56] OUT.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; OH, here we go. We must might as WELL
[1:59:00] PREACH. AMEN. THINK ABOUT IT. HE SAID,
[1:59:02] YOU KNOW THAT EGG. AMEN. AMEN. BEFORE
[1:59:04] THAT LITTLE HEN, BEFORE THERE'LL EVER BE
[1:59:06] ANYTHING TO PICK, AMEN. TO MAKE ITS WAY
[1:59:08] OUT. AMEN. THAT HEN HAD TO BE THE
[1:59:10] ROOSTER.
[1:59:12] WOO. OR there'll never be. It won't BE
[1:59:15] NOTHING BUT A ROTTEN EGG. I DON'T KNOW
[1:59:17] ABOUT YOU, BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE
[1:59:18] BETWEEN BETWEEN A LITTLE BEAUTIFUL PEE
[1:59:20] PEEP TO COME OUT OF THAT EGG. AMEN. AND
[1:59:22] NOTHING BUT BREAKING THAT THING OPEN.
[1:59:24] OO.
[1:59:27] BUT SAYS IN OUR CHURCHES TODAY, WHAT THE
[1:59:30] problem is, WE'VE GOT TOO MANY ROTTEN
[1:59:31] EGGS. IT'S TIME TO GETTING RID OF THE
[1:59:33] ROTTEN EGGS. AMEN. GET SOMEBODY UP IN
[1:59:35] HERE. AMEN. THAT'S FERTILE. THAT'S KNOWN
[1:59:38] GOD. MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE A LITTLE MORE
[1:59:40] HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:41] YOU HAVE MORE. PRAISE GOD. AMENS. YOU'LL
[1:59:44] HAVE MORE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THE LIFE OF
[1:59:46] JESUS CHRIST THAT WON'T BE MEAN TO YOU
[1:59:48] WHEN THEY GET OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH.
[1:59:50] WON'T STEAL AND LIE AND CHEAT AND TALK
[1:59:52] BAD ABOUT YOU WHEN THEY GET OUT OF
[1:59:53] CHURCH.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; WON'T BACKBITE.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; WON'T MAKE A ABSOLUTE HADES FOR THE
[2:00:00] PASTOR
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; and claim to be born again.
[2:00:13] make all kinds of trouble for the
[2:00:15] pastor, just absolute Hades,
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; and then go around the church. Oh, this
[2:00:21] person isn't quite right. And I'm
[2:00:23] thinking, oh, God, if you only knew how
[2:00:24] unright you are.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Why are you worried about this little
[2:00:30] motence in somebody's eye when you got a
[2:00:31] beam in your own?
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:00:38] that's right.
[2:00:40] LET'S GET THE BEAM OUT OF OUR OWN EYE.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE PROPERLY AND
[2:00:44] YOU'LL APPROACH IT RIGHT.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; He won't force your way into it and do
[2:00:49] all kinds of crazy stuff.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Well, anyway,
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; you love him.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; All right, let's get down to business.
[2:01:04] Now, I have one more point I want to
[2:01:07] make, and we certainly will be looking
[2:01:10] like we're going to go into two or three
[2:01:12] part two or three parts. Amen.
[2:01:15] God don't run his business habazard.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; I am so glad for that.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; I
[2:01:23] I love this quote.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; I LOVE THE FACT THAT GOD WOULD NOT CALL
[2:01:28] ME in if he didn't see what I was made
[2:01:32] of first.
[2:01:42] Uh, should I just say what comes to my
[2:01:43] mind?
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Cuz see, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO NOT
[2:01:46] KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO FORWARD, BACKWARDS,
[2:01:48] up or down, or whichever way, but I know
[2:01:51] what just kept me there. Just stand
[2:01:55] having done all to stand. Just stand
[2:01:56] there
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; committed to God.
[2:02:00] And I'm here as a witness along with
[2:02:02] brother Bam. He says, "Every son of God
[2:02:04] comes to this place.
[2:02:06] God will bring us all to a place we just
[2:02:10] can't can't DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN DO. WE JUST
[2:02:16] CAN'T DO NOTHING ABOUT IT."
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Then he wants to see how you act.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Will you just get on your knees and say,
[2:02:25] "God, I don't I don't know what to do."
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; I'm giving it to you, God. It's all
[2:02:30] yours. PEOPLE WANT TO GO CREATE, GO
[2:02:33] CRAZY. I'M WAITING ON GOD.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; I am waiting ON GOD. DO THIS, DO THAT,
[2:02:38] DO WHAT YOU WANT, BUT I'm waiting on
[2:02:40] God.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; I believe God bring us to those places.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; And if he's you're made out of the right
[2:02:49] stuff, you won't go by the wayside.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; No. Even if you do, how many knows you
[2:02:56] will come back?
[2:03:00] How many is that way? Lord, I Yeah.
[2:03:02] Yeah. Yeah. I didn't do so good. BUT I
[2:03:04] COME BACK TO GOD. I GIVE MY HEART BACK
[2:03:05] TO GOD EVEN AFTER ALL THAT I HAVE WENT
[2:03:07] THROUGH. And I speak to people this
[2:03:09] morning right now that's got deep scars
[2:03:11] because of what I'm saying. I have deep
[2:03:13] scars from those things. But how many
[2:03:15] believe I thank God the scar may there
[2:03:19] but he healed it
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; and it feels good.
[2:03:25] Thank God for his healing.
[2:03:30] HE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE MADE OUT OF.
[2:03:34] OH, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT COME TO
[2:03:35] CHURCH AND JUST GET UNDER THE ANOINTING.
[2:03:37] They can get the anointing ON THEIR
[2:03:39] FLESH AND IN THEIR SPIRIT.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; I MEAN, OH, SURE, THOSE ARE THE ONES
[2:03:43] THAT GO BY THE WAYSIDE. THOSE COME DO
[2:03:45] ALL KINDS OF THINGS. BUT IF GOD EVER
[2:03:47] REDEEMS YOU, IF HE EVER BUYS YOUR SOUL,
[2:03:50] YOU ARE HIS FOR TIME AND ETERNITY.
[2:03:55] THIS CONTRACTOR, THIS MAN, THIS
[2:03:57] BUSINESSMAN. AMEN. HE DOES NOT GO
[2:03:59] BANKRUPT. HE DOES NOT LOSE HIS BUSINESS.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; God does not lose his business. He said,
[2:04:16] "My sheep hear my voice, and I know
[2:04:20] them, and they follow me, and I give
[2:04:23] unto them eternal life, and they might
[2:04:25] perish."
[2:04:27] They shall never perish.
[2:04:31] THEY SHALL NEVER PERISH, AND NEITHER
[2:04:33] SHALL ANY MAN PLUCK THEM OUT OF MY HAND.
[2:04:37] WOO! HOW MANY IS GLAD TO BE IN A
[2:04:40] MASTER'S HAND? AMEN. THE BUSINESSMAN'S
[2:04:42] GOT YOU IN HIS HEAD.
[2:04:45] NOTHING'S GOING TO PLUCK YOU OUT OF HIS
[2:04:47] HAND.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; NOTHING'S GOING TO SEPARATE YOU FROM THE
[2:04:51] LOVE OF GOD.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. My father which GAVE THEM ME IS
[2:04:57] GREATER THAN ALL AND NO MAN is able to
[2:04:59] pluck them out of my father's hands.
[2:05:02] ANOTHER PLACE HE SAYS ALL THAT THE
[2:05:04] FATHER HAS GIVEN ME WILL COME TO ME AND
[2:05:07] I WILL LOSE NONE.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY IS GLAD he's not going to lose
[2:05:11] you?
[2:05:19] All right, I'm going to avoid some of
[2:05:21] that and go down here.
[2:05:26] Brother Brandham
[2:05:29] in a prayer line. The lady suffers with
[2:05:32] an extreme nervous condition. Now, we're
[2:05:34] going to talk about a spirit of sadness
[2:05:35] for a minute. Amen. And also the way
[2:05:39] that God does things.
[2:05:42] He says extreme nervous condition. And
[2:05:45] then she's wanting prayer
[2:05:47] for her eyes, too.
[2:05:53] Getting dimmer and dimmer. They're going
[2:05:55] out. It's a hardening of the nerve in
[2:05:58] the eye. The optical nerve is dying,
[2:06:01] which is shutting off light. But you'll
[2:06:04] be all upset about something and you're
[2:06:06] weary.
[2:06:08] I see you shake your head or something
[2:06:11] in a pray. You even wonder sometimes if
[2:06:14] you're actually saved,
[2:06:18] you'd have trouble with that. That's
[2:06:20] true. You doubted your experience of
[2:06:22] being saved.
[2:06:25] But listen to these precious words. But
[2:06:27] I'll tell you now, you are.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; How would you like to have a father tell
[2:06:33] you that? Amen.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; You might think you're not, but I'm here
[2:06:37] to tell you you are.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; But this is caused by a call. Some kind
[2:06:45] of a shock. You've had some news or
[2:06:48] something that shocked you all at once
[2:06:49] that caused this. I It was the death of
[2:06:53] your husband last fall.
[2:06:56] God bless your heart, lady. He says,
[2:06:59] "Let's move the sadness. Everything will
[2:07:03] be all right. Merciful God, as I stand
[2:07:06] before this dear woman and knowing that
[2:07:09] there is a sad spirit around her,
[2:07:12] I ask for thy divine mercy and guidance.
[2:07:16] Laying my hands upon her, I charged that
[2:07:18] sad spirit to leave the woman. Christ
[2:07:22] lives.
[2:07:24] Christ Christ can no more take the word
[2:07:28] back that he said that he said than
[2:07:31] nothing because he's God and he knows
[2:07:34] everything before he says it. And I
[2:07:36] condemn the spirit that would harm this
[2:07:38] woman in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2:07:41] I just want to talk. I just want to ask
[2:07:43] you
[2:07:45] uh it was something you was worried
[2:07:47] about backsliding or something like
[2:07:49] that. He's talking to her now. something
[2:07:52] on that order.
[2:07:54] Well,
[2:07:56] let me tell let me uh tell about your
[2:07:59] experience. Look, sister, this may hurt
[2:08:02] a little bit to the audience. And if you
[2:08:04] don't believe this, I'm talking to this
[2:08:06] woman. See, God don't run his business
[2:08:10] like that.
[2:08:11] Now, you know you WERE ONCE SAVED. YOU
[2:08:14] KNOW THAT. WELL, if God saved you here
[2:08:17] knowing he's going to lose you down the
[2:08:18] road, then he defeats his own purpose.
[2:08:23] He can't lose you. He might even have to
[2:08:26] TAKE YOU OFF THE EARTH BECAUSE OF YOUR
[2:08:28] SIN. But he can't lose you. YOU'RE HIS.
[2:08:32] BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN, HE ordained you
[2:08:35] to eternal life. And it's the devil
[2:08:37] trying to cheat you OUT OF IT. CALL HIM
[2:08:40] A LIAR.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW MANY SAY, "GOD, I DON'T NEVER
[2:08:44] WANT TO HAVE A SAD SPIRIT. DEVIL, YOU'RE
[2:08:47] A LIAR. DON'T TELL ME I'M NOT SAVED.
[2:08:49] DON'T TELL ME I'M NOT FILLED WITH THE
[2:08:51] HOLY GHOST."
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; WHY? Because he said later on talks
[2:08:58] about he said he put your name. God put
[2:09:00] YOUR NAME ON THAT BOOK, LAMB'S BOOK OF
[2:09:02] LIFE FROM THE foundation of the world.
[2:09:04] This is where we get into the ar
[2:09:05] architect part. Folks, I'm here to tell
[2:09:08] you just a little little maybe when you
[2:09:12] have a a plan. How many knows God's got
[2:09:15] a plan?
[2:09:16] In order to be a builder, you got to
[2:09:18] have a plan and you follow that plan.
[2:09:22] Amen. In this natural world, they'll
[2:09:25] mess up on those plans. If you're a good
[2:09:28] builder, you'll say, "Well, that
[2:09:30] architect messed up right here. That'll
[2:09:32] never fit in there. He says that's those
[2:09:34] are the numbers, but they don't add up."
[2:09:36] Then you got to adjust the best you can.
[2:09:39] Hello. Maybe in the denominational ages
[2:09:41] we had to do that. Well, we did the best
[2:09:43] we can. That's all we knew. But now
[2:09:45] we've got a plan. How many's glad for?
[2:09:46] Thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. Stay with
[2:09:49] the word of God. AMEN. BROTHER BO, TELL
[2:09:51] ME WHAT THE PROPHET TAUGHT. TELL ME WHAT
[2:09:53] THE BIBLE TEACHES. WE DON'T WANT A WHOLE
[2:09:55] LOT OF YOUR own input. If you have your
[2:09:57] own ideas, you better TELL ME AHEAD OF
[2:09:59] TIME. THIS IS YOUR THOUGHT.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; How many's glad for that?
[2:10:06] Lord, help us. That sad spirit. Amen
[2:10:10] that she had. But God is still in the in
[2:10:14] the business.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; How many believes he will be
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; until he gets off that mercy seat? He's
[2:10:22] be going to be in the business of
[2:10:24] calling people. Come, come, come, come
[2:10:28] to me.
[2:10:30] All you who are weary and heavy laden.
[2:10:34] NO. WHEN HE SAID THAT, I'D LOVE TO HEAR
[2:10:37] THAT. WOULDN'T YOU? WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
[2:10:38] BACK AND HEAR HOW BROTHER HOW JESUS said
[2:10:40] it? I don't know. He said, "Come unto me
[2:10:44] all ye who are weary and heavy laden,
[2:10:47] and I will give you rest." Maybe that
[2:10:49] was more the way he said it, but Thomas
[2:10:51] Ber says, "Come, COME
[2:10:54] ALL YOU ARE WEARY AND HEAVY LADEN." HOW
[2:10:56] MANY KNOWS? IT'S THE SAME HOLY SPIRIT
[2:10:58] STILL SPEAKING TODAY.
[2:11:01] WHEN YOU TELL THEM, HEY, ACTS 2:30 SAY,
[2:11:04] ACTS 2:30 IS STILL THE WAY. COME GET
[2:11:06] BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST,
[2:11:08] IT'S STILL THE VOICE OF GOD THROUGH THE
[2:11:10] BODY continuing to work.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; And distributing that same healing. How
[2:11:22] many believes that? That's why our
[2:11:24] ministry is healing. We're not here to
[2:11:26] separate people. We're not here to harm
[2:11:28] you. We're here to bring healing. We're
[2:11:31] here to bring forgiveness of your sins.
[2:11:34] We're here to bring not hate, but love.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Grace and mercy.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; I will have mercy. Jesus said, "That's
[2:11:43] my message." Amen.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many is glad that
[2:11:49] you are part of the father's business?
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; And we all would all say, "I want to do
[2:11:56] be about my father's business. That's to
[2:11:59] get as many as the lost in as we can.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I heard brother Bam talk about the
[2:12:04] mailman, the neighbor, whoever it is
[2:12:06] that you can be a light to. Try to shine
[2:12:08] light to others. God bless you. Stand.
[2:12:11] Musicians, if you'll come.
[2:12:18] I ain't a preacher, but I'll tell you
[2:12:20] what gift that God has given me. And
[2:12:23] when you pray for me, I let myself go.
[2:12:26] The Holy Spirit can preach. How many
[2:12:28] believes that?
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; So, I want to say thank you for praying
[2:12:31] for me. How many enjoyed this morning?
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you what. When I got
[2:12:35] Lord just begin to pour that out.
[2:12:40] Amen. Got to share one more thing. You
[2:12:43] know, I talked about how that some maybe
[2:12:45] can't wait for the doors to open. You
[2:12:47] know, but we're supposed to be Amen. the
[2:12:50] presence of God. What Jesus' business is
[2:12:52] to do is to make us thick like molasses.
[2:12:55] Ain't that right? Amen. like that
[2:12:56] molasses that just flows and you you
[2:12:58] wait on that molasses to come on. Come
[2:13:00] on,
[2:13:02] man. It's so thick. It's so slow. That's
[2:13:05] how we're supposed to be when we leave
[2:13:06] here. Oh, we can't hardly get away from
[2:13:08] one another. You know, I I don't want TO
[2:13:10] LEAVE. BUT ABRAHAM SAID WE OUGHT TO LOVE
[2:13:12] ONE ANOTHER SO MUCH. WE CRY WHEN WE
[2:13:14] LEAVE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE
[2:13:16] EACH OTHER FOR FOUR OR FIVE DAYS.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Who's cried leaving uh the church
[2:13:24] lately?
[2:13:28] Good question. Ain't it? I know you
[2:13:30] ain't going to lie.
[2:13:33] That's why your hands stay down.
[2:13:38] Nope. Nope. I can't raise them either.
[2:13:42] That shows us, hey, maybe we can grow a
[2:13:44] little bit, love one another a little
[2:13:46] more. Amen. That's how it ought to be.
[2:13:49] Not hurrying out the door or whatever,
[2:13:51] but loving to be around one another.
[2:13:53] We're brothers and sisters.
[2:13:56] Brother Bryant Sette,
[2:13:58] it's been a long road.
[2:14:02] All of us
[2:14:04] that's journeyed here for the last 30
[2:14:06] years.
[2:14:08] It's been a long road,
[2:14:10] but we thank God. Ain't that right?
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Because we're not looking at another
[2:14:16] five years here. We're looking at going
[2:14:19] to the other side.
[2:14:23] How many's looking forward to going to
[2:14:24] the other side?
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Having a
[2:14:28] Do we have a 20-year-old
[2:14:33] Gersham? How old are you?
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; 18. You're young. Too young to get
[2:14:37] married. What are you talking about?
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; No, you're not. I'm just picking at you.
[2:14:45] They're 18. I didn't know you're that
[2:14:46] young. That's all right.
[2:14:49] We're going to be 18 to 20. Isn't that
[2:14:52] right?
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; The splendor of youth.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; We're looking forward to it. That's not
[2:14:59] a myth, folks.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; How many believes God has the job? God
[2:15:05] has got a job.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I didn't get into it. We'll get into
[2:15:08] it maybe Tuesday. And that is
[2:15:12] Oh, to have us ready. How many believes
[2:15:15] it's God's job to have you ready?
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Sure. He has begun a good work in you
[2:15:21] and the Bible says he's able to perform
[2:15:23] it.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; All we got to do is surrender. Say,
[2:15:25] "God, here I am."
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Do that work. Have us ready for that
[2:15:28] time. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Joe. Let's bow our
[2:15:44] heads. Let's give the Lord a hand. Thank
[2:15:46] you, Jesus.
[2:15:48] Thank you, Jesus. We give you the glory,
[2:15:52] the honor and the glory, Lord Jesus. We
[2:15:54] come before you humbly,
[2:15:56] Lord. And when we think about, Father,
[2:15:58] being part of your program, part of your
[2:16:00] business, Father, that you came and you
[2:16:03] did a work in our hearts, you did a work
[2:16:04] in our lives.
[2:16:07] Something man can't do, something we
[2:16:09] can't do ourselves, but something that
[2:16:11] you did. That's an eternal work. and you
[2:16:15] made us part of your program. We put you
[2:16:18] put us in your will. Your Bible is your
[2:16:21] will and you wrote our names on the book
[2:16:24] of life. We are in your will, Lord. And
[2:16:27] we're so grateful and how happy we are.
[2:16:29] Not because the devils are subject to
[2:16:31] us, not because we could speak in
[2:16:32] tongues and do mighty works, just
[2:16:35] because you elected us with elective
[2:16:37] love. You chose us and we are yours,
[2:16:41] Lord. And we're so grateful, Father, for
[2:16:43] it. We ask God that you'd help us each
[2:16:45] one. Lord,
[2:16:48] each one of us.
[2:16:50] I can't do what somebody else's work is.
[2:16:52] I can't take Tommy's work. He can't take
[2:16:54] my work. We can't take each other's
[2:16:57] business work over. No, you call us all
[2:16:59] to do something, Lord. And we ask God
[2:17:02] this morning with our hands raised
[2:17:04] saying, "Help me to do my job better.
[2:17:07] Lord, just help me to do my job. just
[2:17:10] help me to do what I'm supposed to do
[2:17:12] because you said God that you the
[2:17:14] harvest is great. Labors are a few and
[2:17:17] we enter into the labors Lord of this
[2:17:20] end time. And Father, help us to do what
[2:17:22] we're supposed to do. Help us to keep
[2:17:24] our lamps trimmed and burning. Help us
[2:17:27] to be a light to the world, God. Help us
[2:17:29] to bring salvation to the lost. Father,
[2:17:32] help us to be what you want us to be
[2:17:34] this morning. And as we yield to you and
[2:17:37] we give you praise in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:17:41] And amen. God bless you.
[2:17:46] God bless you. Blessed be
[2:17:50] the time
[2:17:53] that bind
[2:17:57] our hearts in
[2:18:01] Christian love.
