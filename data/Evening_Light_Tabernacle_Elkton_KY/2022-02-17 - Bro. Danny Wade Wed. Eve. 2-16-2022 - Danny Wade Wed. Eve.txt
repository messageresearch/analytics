music um [Music] [Applause] [Music] um i didn't get to miss any fellowship or anything it just happened to me on the way back from the banquet to the place i was staying but um anyways um turn with me if you will to romans 12 and verse 1. i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your body is a living sacrifice holy acceptable to god which is your reasonable service and be not confirmed conformed to this world but be therefore transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that what is that good and acceptable for perfect will of god who is he that overcometh the world oh that was just my title for the next verse anyways um so uh last time i was sick it took me a while to get back to exercising and working out sometimes we get spiritualistic spiritually sick and it takes time for us to get back to exercising our faith and working out our spiritual muscles by reading the word and praying now i was just um thinking for like a while about like um like overcoming the things of the world there there is two types of christians the christian who just wants to go to heaven and simply accept jesus as savior oh yeah you can be seated sorry um and um simply accept jesus as savior and and not as lord because they want to continue in sin and i'll justify it by saying we're all imperfect and and they'll say say that um you know i'll have sin the bible says all of sin and and then they go on living drinking and smoking cussing and everything else sure we we all make mistakes sometimes and and we sin sometimes but we're not supposed to do it willingly and every single day and and people live like that and i've actually met christians at at work that um at the place i used to work at um that said that oh i'm i'm a christian you know and and then i say and see the way that they live you can't tell that then um you can tell that she was a christian by the her actions because actions speak louder than words i didn't even know she she considered herself a christian and believed in in christ but but she had accepted jesus christ as her savior but not as lord see see we we all want to um go to to heaven but but not everyone and wants to to live every single day for for jesus christ not everyone wants to take up the cross and follow him because it's the hardest thing that anyone can do and so that's what we're supposed to take up our cross and follow christ deity not not live like everyone else and she obviously doesn't read her bible because i know her bible doesn't doesn't say to live like that proclaiming to be a christian but her life says otherwise don't think that you can't overcome a bad habit or repetitive sin we are meant to overcome sin through christ who gives it's not by our own power that that we overcome these things we we don't we cannot overcome anything by our own power if you if you did try to overcome sin and without the holy ghost it becomes a legalism religion it just becomes religion you can take on religion and and not have the holy ghost you can you can and do that too there there's uh this they say how that um religious people are so judgmental we we um the thing is you're either gonna be religious you're gonna you're gonna be a christian a follower of christ there's a difference between being religious and being a christian and [Music] so when you've been born again your desires will change and and with christ in you you cannot willingly sin it's it's impossible and unless um of course um well unless uh of course you can you can still backslide but but if you if you return and um back then and um you can you can be a um forgiven and redeemed um anyways uh i was thinking about like putting on on the whole armor of god um like ephesians 6 and stuff the bride is is uh dressed in the word that that is is her armor and she goes exactly with this word and does not does not go a step anyway outside of this word and she puts on this whole armor of god and and um does not stray away from the the word and you can't expect god to be your source of happiness when the world is your source of satisfaction there's where we go wrong when we start to compromise and allow worldly things into our homes and start to look at the things of the world rather than god we need we bring spiritual sickness upon us when we do that sometimes we need a good dose of spiritual medicine to get us back well again to be an overcomer of any type of disease any type of disease that can't be cured by traditional medicine when a doctor say they they can't help you and everything seems hopeless if if you go to be prayed for and you come with expectation and believe that god's going to heal you you're going to be healed but it takes faith the the battle is sick a sick person and once a miracle fights is a fight against doubt because that's what will prevent you from receiving your healing but once you've overcome that fear and doubt that says you're you're going to always stay the same and you rise above that and let faith take over and there's not devil in hell that can stop you from being healed now now uh this um in a 1 john um 5 3 to 6 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is a son of god so so i i say um if you are here in in this message today you are an overcomer because it is not by our own strength and um not by our own strength are we made overcomers but through christ we are made overcomers now i was reading um well i was watching this video a while ago it's about um eagles every eagle when the time comes for them to learn to fly the mother eagles remove the comfort layers from the nest so the eaglets get come uncomfortable and then she starts throwing the iglets out of the nest can you imagine being a little eagle and your mother is throwing out of the nest and in making you uncomfortable and stuff what kind of love is that now um she starts throwing eaglets out of the nest she does it daily and repeatedly until the eaglets learn to fly until the eaglets become fearless grow stronger and eventually they fly in the sky that's kind of like how how god is with us we might be put in uncomfortable situations we might be put in in places we don't want to be but but he's doing it for our own good that we might be able to to become stronger see when bad fit things come when when bad things come our way instead of crying out and wondering why why this is happening to us and stuff so sometimes you got got to grow with your environment grow stronger instead of instead of being thinking that that um [Music] see when usually when a um uh prisoner i was this just came to my mind when a prisoner gets thrown in prison a lot of them they will begin to start working out and get getting all muscular and strong so so in it maybe some of them have been wanting to work out all of a sudden they get thrown in prison now now they now they finally are starting to get get stronger so you have to learn how how to train hard in a word in in in prayer and push yourself outside of your comfort zone to fight against the enemy to keep fighting over and over again until eventually sore above all the things he throws at you soar above the fear above the doubt and become an overcomer uh now some people um we we begin to to think uh i was i i read this um this story a while ago well actually i uh seen this on yeah i've seen this on it on a um well this uh this is a story from a a little kid in the movie called the pursuit of happiness what he's it's a little kid he said one day a man was drowning in the water and a boat came by and said do you need any help and he said no thanks god will save me another boat came by and said do you need any help and he said no thank you god will save me that then he drowned and went to heaven and and said god why didn't you save me and god said i sent you two big boats you dummy so so so sometimes sometimes you think you you can be expecting something from god and then sometimes you're just supposed to climb up onto the boat but you said you expect something something greater god is going to pick you up and and bring you to the shore when he sends help sometimes we need to climb onto the boat and and not reject a help when when it comes our way now um doubt is is the believer's worst enemy and it's satan's biggest weapon we all experience doubt and it tries to take faith's place but it is our duty to overcome it and trust in god but but now faith is an overcomer and those with faith overcome it's that simple faith sees the situation and knows everything will be all right those with faith see past the doubt and confusion and learns to always trust in god faith itself is an overcomer so if we can bring ourselves to a place to always believe and have faith we will be overcomers and overcome everything that gets in our way see sometimes we think man things that aren't going the way that you planned it and and all of a sudden and things will try to to hinder you from getting in a closer walk with god and sometimes we need to um get on our knees to pray that god helps you overcome it because as he will help you overcome it and but you have to be able to to climb onto the boat though that he brings towards you and to help you overcome everything and to overcome those waters and not drown like this guy that avoided every single pose now um i remember when i had stage fright and i still do a little bit because you saw how nervous i was when i started again even though this is the third time i've been up here but i remember when i had stage fright and i couldn't hardly even talk to anyone because i was so shy i remember in sunday school one time i volunteered to dismiss the class in prayer because i would get rewarded points and so we all all about our heads and and then and i was supposed to pray and then all of a sudden my mind just went blank and i couldn't think of anything i i was just stuck in it and it was just a really awkward silence that was that was very embarrassing but but here i am now um up here preaching i i definitely have come a long way in overcoming that um overcoming that shyness and awkwardness come to think of it i've i've overcome a lot i'm not sure how but it was a long process sometimes sometimes it can take a long time to overcome some things so sometimes it might be something that could take weeks could take years to overcome it but but if i just keep pressing on and keep trusting god and you will overcome it just stick with with this word and every everything that that satan throws against you if you stay with this word if you if you you respond back with with um with scripture you'll always beat the devil every every single time so you know what i was i was thinking think of it like like this um satan and comes like like the the giant like um like like a giant like that let let's just say you're you're david and here comes um satan and the goliath but but god's given you you the authority to to take him out god so told you to take him out and and you you stand there where with with the word on your heart and satan and comes and says you come to me with with a a slingshot exactly here what he said but i'm pretty sure he didn't say it that way but um he think of i'm saying for example um here you are standing against this big giant and and the devil says you can't beat me you're a little a puny little guy how are you gonna defeat me and and you you say because thus saith the lord i heard god uh because of this word i i have overcome you and and you throw that those stones um you stand and firmly on that word and say say devil you've been defeated and and not not by your own strength but because god is with you now um when there's a storm chickens will run and hide all birds i all birds will go and hide in in the the trees or wherever they go and and hide from from the storm but eagles fly above the storm when a storm urm comes in your life you can choose to run it high like a chicken or you can fly above the stormlight like an eagle above the things of the world above all these other denominations and so forth earth and fly above uh sand fly above the devil because you have had the word and if you stand on on that word you cannot fail and and the storm will not harm you and an eagle has a lot of faith in its wings and never worries if its wings are going to be strong enough and the eagle always trusts its wings and nose its wings will be able to get the eagle above the storm amen regardless i mean uh we we need to always trust in god and know that he is always able to bring us above the storm regardless of the way we feel and what we are going through we can always trust in our wings the only way we could fly above all these these denominations and creeds and so forth is with our wings amen the holy spirit is our wings without it we would be lost we'd be like an eagle with no wings what that that eagle wouldn't be able to hunt for fresh meat it would it would eventually die of starvation it would eventually die of starvation yeah so we have the the wings of an eagle to fly above all these other things now i was we're listening to this um sermon by uh brother branham called how can i overcome now um it says here that's the one that that's in you is light and the one that is the wor that's in the world is darkness so the light has proved has proved to overcome the darkness and then the man that's in christ knows that he's overcome the things of the world amen it has no more ties to you all at all you're free walk in the light as he is in the light in the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin and we have fellowship one with another there there you are he that's in you is greater than he that is in the world now if you look back you're condemned when then and you're still in the world but if you're living above that then he that is in you has led you above the darkness and then sometimes sometimes we we get um we get it's so so caught up in the moment i mean we we all do it we we stopped thinking about like the consequences of of what we're doing right in that moment and we just think about it in the in the carnal way of thinking you can get this like right now and that's how a lot of times um that will spark a a sin that that comes in your life because you're thinking about what what you're doing in that exact moment and and what you can get right now but but we need a um a mentality to think what what will what would jesus do in this moment you know because if we always think that every single time we probably it wouldn't do a lot of things that we do sometimes and in uh here romans 12 20 to 21 therefore if thou an enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt he holds a fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good so whenever evil comes your way overcome it with good do good to overcome evil all evil that that satan throws at yet that you or people in general will throw at you overcome it with good and and we all know that that the word is good and god is good so if we overcome it by the scripture will be all right amen how many love the lord sometimes god will send trials and tribulations our way and when he does we never like it because a lot of times it's just so painful and we we don't understand why why god does this to us but in reality is to make us stronger a soldier never gets better at fighting by city on a flowery bed of these a soldier get gets stronger by by experience and training sometimes we go through things that we can only get out of with faith in god that that means god is testing your faith and and this trial is meant to increase your faith so just trust in god sometimes we we get a sickness maybe to increase your faith and help you go closer to god for we know that god is a healer and it's up to you to believe and know that he is able to deliver you from the sickness and whatever everything you may have so so i also like like that um what i was saying about um that that person that was drowning in the water or the the boats came by but he had to accept the boat he had to accept it he he couldn't and just uh otherwise he would drown which he did because he didn't accept the the help he didn't accept it you have to accept it that if if you're sick you have to accept the healing and you've been healed already just like he would have been and saved already by the the two two boats that came along but but he rejected it if we we if we reject and if we reject god if we reject his help then how are we to be delivered how are we to be overcomers of these things if we don't accept the healing if we don't accept the the deliverance if we don't accept it how can we receive it and and it's it is it is hard sometimes to to be an overcomer but every every single um age there's always been being someone that god has to be an overcomer god's got a people that's overcomers i believe i believe this night that that um we are overcomers and we aren't overcomers by by our own own um works but we are overcomers because of christ and and because jesus christ has overcome the cross and has overcome the world so that we can be overcomers through christ and if you have christ in you then you are an overcomer because christ is an overcomer and and we shall overcome everything and we shall overcome the world we cannot live in sin if christ is in us we cannot live in sin if we are born again we won't have that those desires to do those things like the world we cannot do that many people think well you've been um born again if you just say a few words and and you just you just um that that's why i remember that they said um in uh vacation bible school i think it was at um when we were literally went to this uh baptist um vacation bible school and stuff and you know how how it is i didn't ever understand everything that they said how how you'd be um saved or born again or whatever if you just say a few words and um uh of course i would always i i would always think that um i could just um say a few words uh i thought repentance was simply um you know your pet and you don't do it ever again um i learned that the hard way that you also have the desires if you if you just simply say you repent and and not truly be born again you'll still have the same desires and and so we we've got to be born again to to overcome sin we cannot escape sin without being born again because even in trying to do religion and works and stuff to try to to overcome sin it's by our own strength it's it won't be sufficient it won't be enough that's that's trying to to do a legalistic way and i remember trying trying to to be a legalists trying to try well i was trying to be um get away from sin without being truly born again because it was only when i i got the baptism of the holy ghost was when i truly didn't desire to do any sin whatsoever and it is only then that that you can truly truly be an overcomer if you become born again and you have christ in you that which christ cannot sin and and so if you have christ in you you cannot sin either and and the bible says you cannot sin if you're in christ those are in christ and there's no condemnation to those that are in christ and all those that are that have sinned now now i i thought that you you get born again you cannot make any mistakes you cannot mess up of course you can because we're human beings and and all of sin and fallen short the glory of god i think he was fallen short and and have sinned but the bible doesn't say all continuance in and live in sin those that are in christ those that pick up the cross daily and follow him don't live in sin do they do not live in sin because because of that so um now here's some something um something to think about for a second satan fears us think about that for a second we we have have been given the power to overcome everything that satan throws at us that that's the reason that we've been attacked so much is because because satan is scared of us he he's always trying to fight against us and and um you might i think it's so hard to to overcome um everything that satan and throws at you but satan and he's always trying to attack us and and but if you think about it satan has asked god if he can do something to you he has to have permission before he can even touch you it shows how much more powerful our god is so don't ever think a wall is too hard to climb or that you can't overcome something we can do all things through christ who strengthens us that's when that's what the bible says so don't ever doubt we are more than conquerors to christ amen now you you can you can say that you're you're an overcomer in everything but if you don't ever have the the right kind of mindset then then um then you'll just be washed away like like um but uh here's it says in my notes if you if you always go around thinking man i'm never gonna overcome these things i'm i'm not gonna overcome these addictions or trials or whatever it might be if if you have that kind of mindset it needs to change because it's what kind of attitude you have that will create the outcome if you just concentrate on what christ did and who he is and develop a mindset that because of what he did i am i am an overcomer if if we get that mindset that we can overcome these things not by our own strength but through christ who gives us strength and and if we take him at his word we will overcome everything that tries to stand in our way because we can say it is written now i was i was um listening to that um tape that brother branham um said like he preached um and he he was preaching about um like um lot and his lot's wife lot's wife had overcome that um land and that she was in but it was still in her see sometimes we can think we can go on outside the city of sin and then and then if it's still in us if if it's still in us then then you turn around and she looked back and she turned to a pillar of salt because she still loved that place and it was in her to to um to look back to that that place was still in her see sometimes christians will say well i want to accept christ i want to to believe in in jesus christ i want to go to heaven that's always the first thing that comes to mind oh if you believe in jesus christ you're going to go to heaven you won't perish but if it's still in your heart to do sin and you kind of they they kind of just just um walk out of the the city they're like yes i i want to to go to heaven and then and then all of a sudden they'll start thinking man such a long road and such a long hard road on this road you know i love love the way it was before just like the the um the gods people in in egypt when they were like you know um yes we want to get out of this place it's it's horrible they we're slaves and then they want when they got in in the desert and they or when they um seen that uh river when they seen the river they're like now we're all gonna be killed i guess god god um god led us out here to die the army's after us to kill us why why have you brought us out here to die and and and then and then um well of course the god parted the water theirs and they went right through and then when they're in the desert they thought i want some uh water i need water i need food and then and they thought man it was so nice in egypt when uh when they were there they were like i get i would can't wait to get out of this place it's horrible and then and now now they still had egypt in their hearts and because they thought oh it's at least we had food and you know it's good and that now they're on a harder road than they were on before and and that's how we we begin in on this this journey with uh with god when um that's that's how i was when i started in this thing i was like you know it's you i i still had the the world in my heart and and that's how how um a lot of worldly um people are they they're like okay let's go to this promised land just like they were let's go to this promised land but but they don't understand that it's a it's a hard road to get to that promise thing you have to be able to to to endure through it all just that just like i was preaching last time it's it's a hard journey and you have to be able to not give up and keep going and and [Music] and and you know sometimes um we will we always have the world in our hearts until we become born again and then that's that's the old man that we put in it that we have to crucify every single day and and that's how it's gotta be we we have to to get out of the of that place that that we were in before or get that out of our hearts and we can't do that on our own we we have to accept the lord jesus christ and and become born again and according to the word and god god didn't choose a bunch of losers to be his bride he chose us because he knew we would overcome the things of the world and choose to serve him instead and the fact that you are here today is proof that you're an overcomer i'm not saying we're overcomers simply by our own works but through christ we are made overcomers and and we have to put on the whole armor of god to be be able to overcome these these things and and here um brother branham said what what was in there by god at the beginning it pressed its way through overcome it overcome the shell it overcome the mud it overcome the waters it overcome everything and what was an overcomer and reflected the beauty and glory of god that's the way every believer does that's the way know it that's the way lot did that's the the way look look what a mess he was in that that's the way moses did that's the way joshua did that's the way daniel did that's the way shadrach meshach did that's the way john the baptist did zacharias elizabeth that's what that's the way that simeon that's the the way that anna every one of them did they overcome the mud that that that there was around them and packed into them stuck their head above the thing and shine forth the glory of god that's what a real christian does and and that that's how how it is you get away from these other things and get away from them these uh get away from sodom and and gamora that's how how the world is like today it's it's getting worse and worse every single day and and we have to overcome the world and and we have to overcome the world and and we have to do it and like i said we cannot do it by our own strengths we have to do it and through jesus christ who gives us this strength and that's why we are overcomers because we have overcome the world we've gotten away from those things we have have taken on a new name and we we have have we have um accepted in jesus christ and we are we are uh we are are the bride and we we have to [Music] overcome these things and and sometimes it might be something that that you're struggling with it might be something that that you you might still be dealing with because i i know that i didn't and overcome everything and just by um just in an instant i i had to overcome things gradually sometimes and you might be it might be a it might be a repetitive sin and it might be something that that we constantly are sending every single day how can i do this i was i've i've been there and and and it's it's a hard place and and you have to be able to just pick up your cross and follow him and it's it's the hardest thing that we can do if we if we a it can and we we can do that because jesus christ it took his cross and now we have to to follow him and that that is the the way to be to truly be an overcomer to overcome the world and an overcomer is one that has accepted jesus christ and has been born again we we cannot stay in in sin and claim to be a christian it's not going to work that way and here it says look he showed us how it's done how did he do it by the word that's how he done it for he was the word and jesus said if you bite in me and my words and you you're back to act two word again the the word of promise what is the word of promise to every christian greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world then how do i overcome not not me but the the word that's in me the word is god and i overcome the things of the world because it's the word in me if you bite in in my words in you then just ask what you will just keep pressing up you're coming to the top as sure as anything see you got to come to the top see we have to overcome the these these other other their things and we have to do it um with with jesus christ in prayer always is in prayer and and focusing on on god and and seeking him to do his perfect will and and we we can overcome everything that that satan tries in and throws at us stand if you will um so so the only way to over overcome sin is through jesus christ and we know this so so the the only way we can overcome the devil is if we put on the full armor of god just like here in ephesians 6 and verse 10 to 19. also musicians if you come finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the violence of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual witness wickedness in high places see it's it's it's always um satan's always trying to throw his his darts at us he's always trying to to to attack us and if if we stick right with that word then we will overcome everything we will overcome the and every single thing that the devil throws at us and and uh every every time that that that satan and tries to um distract us and tries to to get us away from his word and get us to to look to other things i mean he cannot pluck us from his hand but he'll he'll certainly try to make make our life a miserable and and we have to keep pressing on we have to keep keep keep going and and just trust in god through it all no matter what happens no matter what and what comes our way and always trust in him amen we're we are overcomers not not because we're something that how great we are but how great he is how great he is in us that that we might overcome everything that that's in this world and we are overcomers because as those that are are because greater is he that is in us that that than he that is in the world and and we we will we will make it out to the end we will be overcomers there's in the end we will let's pray father god i pray that that that you help each and every one of us lord if if any of us is still struggling with something lord still still trying to overcome something that satan has put in in our lives lord if satan has has put a sin in any of our lives that that we're just struggling with every single day and we feel like we don't have
