[4:37] i was tired but i'm really tired but
[4:40] anyway
[4:41] uh tracker he's the one that we got
[4:43] right at the beginning of uh
[4:46] you know from the beginning when he was
[4:47] out there on the farm so he's really
[4:49] means a lot to us he's very
[4:51] very special dog to us elf dog and he's
[4:54] a
[4:54] good dog but anyway so i was sleeping
[4:58] and i heard
[5:00] him and whatever other dogs we had in
[5:03] the house he come flying up this air
[5:06] i'm like i'm not up yet why you all
[5:08] coming up so fast
[5:11] man anyway that dog come up real fast up
[5:14] the stairs
[5:16] and he jumps and flies up on the bed
[5:19] and i thought man what is he chasing a
[5:22] cat a bird
[5:23] what's going on and he comes across
[5:27] my face he landed in my face in my head
[5:31] what is going on and anyway
[5:36] ended up on the nightstand and and down
[5:39] on the floor
[5:41] i said this is right show me right so i
[5:43] jumped up
[5:44] it's still dark so i turned the light on
[5:47] so i find him on the floor laying on
[5:51] against the wall
[5:52] with his mouth open and kind of kicking
[5:54] he was just dying he was
[5:56] like passed out he you know
[5:59] and so anyway i was like what in the
[6:01] world so he had his mouth wide open
[6:04] and so he must you know if he could have
[6:07] done anything else he would have but i
[6:09] know he must have probably passed out
[6:11] about the time that he was hit my head
[6:14] in the nightstand because it was a big
[6:15] flop
[6:16] and just fell down on the floor like
[6:19] and anyway so i seen his mouth open
[6:22] and i just presume something down his
[6:24] throat or whatever so i reached in his
[6:25] mouth
[6:27] went babe as far as i could and i felt
[6:29] something it felt
[6:30] you know we still don't know what it was
[6:32] but it felt like you know maybe dog
[6:34] food wadded up a lot of dog food or
[6:36] whatever and i couldn't get in behind it
[6:38] so i pushed my finger like beside it
[6:40] through it or whatever and
[6:41] just push whatever it was just pushed it
[6:44] further down
[6:46] you know and there he was still laying
[6:48] and still doing his mouth thing so i
[6:50] give him a good hard push on his chest
[6:52] you know
[6:53] my wife's like menu don't bust his chest
[6:56] but
[6:56] i couldn't give him no cpr you know so i
[6:58] just put a put a good heart on
[7:01] push hard on his chest without you know
[7:02] breaking his ribs or anything but
[7:05] and then uh he had his mouth wide open
[7:07] all of a sudden he like closed his mouth
[7:08] and just a little bit
[7:10] and directly he kind of just
[7:13] tried to pick his head up and he looked
[7:16] at us and he was like
[7:17] back you know he didn't know he didn't
[7:19] know where he was what was going on he
[7:21] had passed out apparently
[7:22] and coming back too he had had no oxygen
[7:25] i guess for a little bit
[7:26] and so anyway he didn't really recognize
[7:30] us and then we talked to him a little
[7:31] bit and talked to him and
[7:32] all of a sudden i mean just like that i
[7:34] don't know if it was putting it
[7:36] pushing that down or the chest or what
[7:37] it was but donna was praying i said
[7:39] donna help me you know
[7:41] because he was it was really kind of
[7:43] traumatic for me because everyone my
[7:45] favorite dog was
[7:47] laying there dying and
[7:53] the thing of it was he knew
[7:56] his condition and that's why he called
[8:00] him
[8:05] people in the bird or a cat he's trying
[8:07] to live
[8:10] but anyway so
[8:14] he breathed began to breathe again you
[8:16] know just like it was all over
[8:18] and it took probably 20 minutes for him
[8:21] to really get his
[8:22] bearings about him and you know and and
[8:25] everything but i was just thankful that
[8:27] the lord spared him amen
[8:29] you know because he was very close he
[8:31] was very close
[8:33] and he and realized he was coming for
[8:35] help
[8:37] because that's as far as he made it was
[8:39] about my head and
[8:40] after that he just kind of crashed
[8:44] but i just thank the lord that he spirit
[8:47] buried him at all
[8:54] that's why that course is singing more
[8:56] than ever before
[8:57] lord i need you oh more than ever

[29:03] a couple of
[29:04] little things that i want to make
[29:05] mention of thank you for the music
[29:07] tonight
[29:09] i spoke to brother ben norrod i didn't
[29:12] speak to him he sent me a text and maybe
[29:13] some of you got it
[29:15] too but he wanted me to share with the
[29:17] church that
[29:18] if you remember the last time he was
[29:20] here he was talking about
[29:21] i guess with his diabetic neuropathy and
[29:23] so forth that
[29:24] his eyes were giving him trouble and
[29:26] they were thinking maybe you know
[29:28] they were telling him you know they were
[29:30] telling him that
[29:31] blindness could be in his future and he
[29:34] went for a
[29:35] series of tests and and he had to have
[29:37] some injections some time ago
[29:39] and he sent me today a text and i wish i
[29:41] had it but i left my phone
[29:42] at home but he just said praise the lord
[29:45] my eyes were perfect
[29:47] they told me that said not to even worry
[29:49] about coming back for i think he said
[29:51] six months just for a checkup
[29:53] so god's still a healer god's still
[29:56] alive amen
[29:57] [Applause]
[30:00] and you know i tell you what it's just
[30:03] uh
[30:04] god's good we're living in an hour where
[30:05] god will manifest himself if we ask
[30:08] and and i think that's what we have to
[30:10] come to do uh
[30:11] tonight um i got on my heart some time
[30:14] ago
[30:16] this little thought and and i want to
[30:18] speak on worship and praise
[30:20] and it's been on my mind for a while and
[30:24] then this last week we've done some
[30:25] traveling with our idea with
[30:27] my boys they uh we're on a school trip
[30:30] playing
[30:30] playing baseball down in florida uh you
[30:33] know that's a
[30:34] sound like a good trip baseball in
[30:36] florida but
[30:38] you know my boys go to a christian
[30:40] school and and the coach is a pastor of
[30:42] a church and
[30:43] i think there were three or four other
[30:44] pastors there and so they did give their
[30:47] daily devotions and
[30:48] and they asked me to finish up on the
[30:50] last day there with daily devotions and
[30:52] and you know they spoke about repentance
[30:54] and second chances and
[30:56] and the cross and salvation just great
[30:58] great
[30:59] guys and men of you know that preach the
[31:02] word and i tell you it really makes you
[31:03] it makes me
[31:04] i shouldn't say it makes you but it
[31:06] makes me sometimes when i see how they
[31:08] can dissect the word
[31:10] in the bible it kind of makes me feel a
[31:12] little small sometimes you know because
[31:13] they're scholars and
[31:14] and i don't get my messages that way i
[31:16] pray and i pray that god leads me
[31:19] and i'll take it that way if he'd given
[31:21] it so but this little thought on worship
[31:23] and praise and it went real well the
[31:25] little devotion that we had and so
[31:27] i want to continue and get a little
[31:28] deeper into it tonight if we could
[31:30] and what i want to do is i want to ask
[31:32] ourselves the question
[31:34] um if you don't mind stand and start
[31:36] turning to psalms 138
[31:38] but ask the question that i want to ask
[31:42] is does god demand
[31:43] our praise and if so how do we meet this
[31:47] demand
[31:48] and what happens when we give god praise
[31:51] so that's that's three pretty big
[31:52] questions right there uh does god demand
[31:55] it
[31:55] how do we meet that meet that demand and
[31:58] what happens
[31:58] when we give god praise and i thought
[32:00] you know this was fitting compared to
[32:02] or following up with brother byler's
[32:04] last message
[32:05] uh and he spoke about cain and cain you
[32:08] know brought his
[32:08] his worship he brought his sacrifice to
[32:11] the altar and god didn't accept it
[32:13] and god said i'll require you to do it
[32:15] this way
[32:16] or else and so god basically said i'm
[32:19] demanding you
[32:20] to bring your sacrifice in this fashion
[32:23] or else i don't accept it
[32:25] so as we read these scriptures here
[32:27] let's look at this and
[32:29] i got my eyes on the clock what i can
[32:31] see so i'll try not to hold us too long
[32:33] i don't think we will so
[32:35] psalms 138 david speaking
[32:39] i will praise thee with my whole heart
[32:41] before the gods
[32:43] will i sing praise unto thee i will
[32:46] worship toward thy holy temple and
[32:48] praise thy name for thy loving kindness
[32:50] and for thy truth
[32:51] for thou hast magnified thy word above
[32:54] all thy name in the day
[32:56] when i cried thou answered us me
[33:00] and strengtheneth me with strength in my
[33:02] soul
[33:03] all the kings of the earth shall praise
[33:06] thee o lord
[33:07] when they hear the words of thy mouth
[33:11] look at this here david david's saying
[33:13] here he's going to be
[33:15] heard he's going to let his voice sound
[33:18] above everybody who god is
[33:21] yea they shall sing in the ways of the
[33:24] lord
[33:24] for great is the glory of the lord
[33:27] though the lord be high yet hath he
[33:29] respect unto the lowly but the proud
[33:32] he knoweth afar off though i walk in the
[33:35] midst of trouble
[33:36] thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch
[33:39] forth thy hand against the wrath of my
[33:41] enemies and thy right hand shall save me
[33:44] the lord will perfect that which
[33:46] concerneth
[33:47] me do you hear that
[33:51] the lord will perfect that which
[33:53] concerneth me so david says anything
[33:55] that i'm going through in life
[33:57] god will perfect that god will perfect
[34:00] whatever challenges i have
[34:01] god will protect it and look what the
[34:03] next statement is he says
[34:04] thy mercy david knew where he stood
[34:08] he knew he still needed god's mercy thy
[34:10] mercy o lord endureth forever
[34:14] forsake not the works of thine own hands

[35:01] we ask that you've been the remainder of
[35:03] the service tonight lord
[35:04] in jesus name amen as you're seeing turn
[35:07] to psalms 150 if you still
[35:09] got your finger there in psalms a little
[35:11] familiar scripture
[35:14] while you're getting back there
[35:20] this psalm here stands out to us
[35:24] says praise ye the lord praise god in
[35:28] his sanctuary
[35:30] praise him in his firmament of his power
[35:32] praise him for his mighty acts
[35:34] praise him according to his excellent
[35:36] greatness praise him with the sound of
[35:38] the trumpet praise him with the psalter
[35:39] in the heart
[35:40] praise him in the timbrel in the dance
[35:42] praise him with stringed instruments and
[35:43] organs praise him upon the loud symbols
[35:46] praise him upon the high sounding
[35:48] symbols
[35:48] let everything that hath breath praise
[35:52] the lord praise you the lord now we're
[35:55] sitting here today if you're here i hope
[35:57] you're living i hope you're breathing so
[35:58] it's our responsibility as christians if
[36:01] you're alive and you know what god has
[36:03] done for you
[36:03] praise ye the lord
[36:07] so the question does god demand our
[36:09] praise
[36:10] i want to start with this quote this
[36:12] familiar quote we've heard it a million
[36:13] times if you've been around this message
[36:15] you've heard it
[36:16] i was preaching one night and a woman
[36:18] got to screaming and shouting
[36:20] and a little baptist brother told me the
[36:22] next day said i was enjoying your
[36:23] message
[36:24] till that woman went to screaming said
[36:27] you know that made chills run all over
[36:29] my back
[36:30] i said brother you're living in the
[36:33] quietest place
[36:34] in the world that you could live in if
[36:36] you go to hell there will be weeping and
[36:38] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[36:40] and if you go to heaven they'll be
[36:42] screaming and shouting all the
[36:44] time he said why i said man
[36:47] if it made chills run up your back what
[36:50] will it do when you get to heaven
[36:52] he said well you'll freeze to death when
[36:54] you get there
[36:55] listen this next statement because
[36:56] you'll be so out of place
[37:00] you'll be so out of place now brothers
[37:02] and sisters
[37:03] if if you're out of place there in
[37:05] heaven where does that put us here if
[37:07] we're not worshipping
[37:08] and praising god and lifting god up and
[37:11] into his highest adoration what does
[37:13] that put us here
[37:14] if you don't be in pla if you'll be out
[37:15] of your place in heaven
[37:17] we're heavenly beings
[37:20] for even the angels with wings over
[37:23] their face and over their feet
[37:24] are singing holy holy holy
[37:28] lord god almighty holy holy
[37:31] holy can you imagine all day long an
[37:34] angelic choir
[37:35] holy holy holy
[37:39] non-stop listen god is an object
[37:42] of worship listen he says this
[37:46] god is worshiped worshipped he says it
[37:49] twice
[37:50] he's iterating hitting it strong he says
[37:51] if anything i honor the pentecostal
[37:54] people for
[37:55] is if they let loose and worship
[37:58] god
[38:02] brothers and sisters i believe that one
[38:03] of the biggest hang-ups that we have for
[38:05] the believer today
[38:06] is that letting loose and giving god
[38:08] worship and praise that he has do
[38:11] because let me tell you there's a huge
[38:13] difference a huge difference between
[38:15] getting up here or getting in church and
[38:17] and brother david telling you hey turn
[38:19] to page so and so we're going to sing
[38:20] amazing grace we're going to sing
[38:22] i'm one of them we're going to sing this
[38:23] song there's a big difference between
[38:25] getting up and singing
[38:26] and worship
[38:30] god is great and greatly to be praised
[38:34] so doesn't mean i see this just think
[38:35] about what has god done in your life
[38:38] today i'm just saying today i'm asking
[38:41] you a question for the past 24 hours
[38:43] what has god done for you
[38:46] you woke up you've eaten you're not
[38:49] alone you're clothed
[38:51] you've been protected you've been
[38:52] delivered you've been forgiven
[38:54] you've been sealed until the day of
[38:56] redemption that's just today and
[38:58] that's just just barely scratching paper
[39:01] brothers and sisters there's not enough
[39:02] paper in the heavens
[39:04] to write down what god has done for you
[39:07] since you've been alive
[39:12] but you know what we're living in an age
[39:14] of hustle
[39:16] hustle bustle we live in this age of
[39:19] hustle and bustle
[39:20] and and and and we've got to be here we
[39:22] got to be there we got to go see this
[39:24] person we got to see that person our
[39:25] minds
[39:26] are constantly running at full throttle
[39:29] constantly going wide open and we rarely
[39:32] have time to slow down
[39:35] we rarely have time to slow down
[39:38] sometimes you ladies just hope you have
[39:40] time to fix supper
[39:42] because it's this and this and go here
[39:43] and go there and to be here and be there
[39:45] and i bet if i'm willing to say that 80
[39:48] to 90 percent of our focus throughout
[39:50] the day is
[39:51] not on god
[39:55] it's the truth 80 to 90
[39:58] of our focus is not on god's our minds
[40:01] are revolving around work
[40:03] they're revolving around school they're
[40:05] revolving around getting their kids to
[40:06] their activities cooking cleaning
[40:08] money family fun time we gotta have
[40:10] family fun time right
[40:12] and then you gotta rest and relax right
[40:16] the excuses of life the excuses we put
[40:20] up before god's
[40:22] praise then we wake up the next morning
[40:25] we do it all again
[40:26] it's every day around and around and
[40:29] around
[40:30] so where does that leave god at where
[40:33] does that leave god in our lives
[40:35] as christians again
[40:38] blood bought christians
[40:42] listen to what david says he says i'll
[40:45] this is
[40:46] 138 let's break it down i will praise
[40:49] thee with my whole
[40:51] heart and i've been astonished by
[40:53] looking at the life of david you know
[40:54] you think about david first thing he
[40:56] thanks david and goliath
[40:58] you think those things but man you read
[41:00] in samuel
[41:01] and then you read about david and the
[41:03] life he lived
[41:04] he is a man that amazes me he astonishes
[41:07] me because i realize how much
[41:09] i'll fall short when i read about david
[41:12] i realize how much i fall short and we
[41:15] got to be honest with ourselves or we
[41:17] never grow close to god
[41:19] if you want to get closer to god be
[41:21] honest with yourself
[41:22] don't don't fool yourself don't lie to
[41:24] yourself until you are a christian
[41:26] because i do this this and this
[41:27] you better have a relationship of praise
[41:29] and worship to draw god
[41:31] close into your heart
[41:34] listen what david says
[41:38] david says i will praise god with all of
[41:41] my heart
[41:43] wholeheartedly i'm in
[41:47] he's making a commitment to god i'm in
[41:49] wholeheartedly i
[41:50] am in with you god and he's saying there
[41:52] is no room for
[41:54] anything else in my life but you god
[41:59] your whole heart no room for nothing
[42:02] else
[42:02] no room for any kind of activity no room
[42:05] for anything
[42:06] outside of god i'm giving it all to you
[42:09] god
[42:14] don't have to raise your hands but how
[42:15] many of you feel like you're giving 100
[42:17] to god
[42:20] you agreed with me a minute ago that
[42:21] we're probably not thinking about god 90
[42:23] of the time
[42:26] so where does that leave us you say well
[42:29] some people might say well
[42:31] oh david he had it made oh king david he
[42:34] had it made he had everything he wanted
[42:35] in life he just set up on the throne
[42:37] he's eating grapes drinking wine
[42:38] everything was fine he didn't have
[42:40] nothing to do but set and praise god
[42:41] that's not true
[42:43] that's not true we're talking about a
[42:45] king of a nation
[42:46] a king of a nation so he was doing a
[42:48] whole lot more than that
[42:50] he was going out he was living that
[42:51] day-to-day activities listen
[42:53] but listen what he says he says the next
[42:55] verse before the gods i will sing
[42:59] praise
[43:04] you say well there's only there's only
[43:06] god to serve
[43:07] there was only god to praise only god
[43:09] was there for him to worship that's not
[43:10] what he says the next line
[43:12] he because he said before the gods
[43:14] little g
[43:17] little g i will praise
[43:20] and sing praise unto thee so somewhere
[43:24] brothers and sisters
[43:25] there was people there somewhere that
[43:27] had other gods they had other idols they
[43:29] had other things that they were involved
[43:31] in and wrapping their lives around and
[43:32] spending their time with
[43:35] and david made a bold statement says out
[43:37] of uh
[43:38] when all these gods are out here and all
[43:40] these people are giving their time and
[43:42] effort and praise to their gods
[43:44] i'm going to sing praises to you god
[43:47] big g
[43:51] he says i will worship toward thy holy
[43:55] temple
[43:56] i will praise thy name for thy
[43:58] lovingkindness for thy truth
[44:00] for thou hast magnified thy word above
[44:03] all thy
[44:04] name so david was just like
[44:08] us he was just like us
[44:11] he's been in the hustle and bustle he's
[44:14] living life as a king he's going here
[44:16] going there meeting this person meeting
[44:17] that president this president
[44:19] you can imagine the life of trying to
[44:20] run a country
[44:22] and he's trying to run a country and
[44:24] serve god and he's running all over the
[44:26] place
[44:26] he wasn't sitting around eating bon bons
[44:28] and enjoying life
[44:30] that's not what david was doing many
[44:33] things around him
[44:35] could have been worshiped
[44:38] many things around him could have been
[44:40] treasured as gods to him
[44:46] but in the midst david says i'll sing
[44:49] praises
[44:50] to you god
[44:54] david worshiped david worshiped god
[44:56] because he knew that deliverance was
[44:58] in praise look at the life of david over
[45:02] and over and over
[45:03] failure after failure after failure but
[45:05] yet he praises and praises and praises
[45:07] because why
[45:08] he knew it was deliverance when he
[45:10] fought the giant when he went before a
[45:12] giant
[45:12] the first thing he said is you will be
[45:14] delivered
[45:15] unto me by my god he was praising god
[45:19] before the fight
[45:20] ever happened how many times do we go
[45:23] into an appointment
[45:24] we go into a doctor's appointment and we
[45:26] we do myself
[45:28] before we ever hear the report
[45:34] and it's hard not to do because science
[45:37] and technology is so
[45:38] so strong so still it's hard not to get
[45:40] yourself in a rut but you somewhere you
[45:42] got to say
[45:43] god will deliver me god will deliver
[45:47] this god will deliver this sickness this
[45:50] cancer this whatever it is god will
[45:52] deliver it
[45:54] unto me praise the lord
[45:57] so no matter what david was facing in
[45:59] life he knew that there was no giant big
[46:02] enough in the land that could stand
[46:03] before him as long as he was praising
[46:06] god
[46:12] and we are believers of the message of
[46:14] the hour
[46:17] forgive me for always throwing this up
[46:19] in our face but it's who we are
[46:23] we're believers of the message of the
[46:25] hour we've been given the revealed word
[46:27] in our day
[46:30] we've already talked about giving our
[46:32] heart to the lord we've already talked
[46:33] about salvation
[46:35] and we've talked about that but we're
[46:37] the message believers of the hour we've
[46:38] been given the revealed word of the day
[46:40] identified as the bride of jesus christ
[46:43] do you realize what that means
[46:45] that god looks at you at you as his
[46:47] sweetheart
[46:48] that he loves you that he adores you
[46:51] that he wants everything that he can do
[46:53] to be for you
[46:56] and where do we put him
[47:00] where do we put him
[47:03] are we giving him the praise he deserves
[47:07] no we're honest probably not no we're
[47:10] not
[47:10] we're all likely falling short
[47:14] but one thing about the believer one
[47:17] thing about the bride of jesus christ
[47:20] is she always wants a closer walk with
[47:22] him
[47:25] there's nothing like if you're having a
[47:28] bad day
[47:30] i can remember some time ago we were
[47:32] living in the other house
[47:34] and i was just having a horrible
[47:36] miserable
[47:37] no good day i think that's a movie a
[47:38] kid's movie
[47:41] but it was that kind of day and it was
[47:43] just like i was so deflete
[47:44] though so just depressed and deflated
[47:47] and
[47:48] and i remember joel's walking in and i
[47:50] just said come here i need you
[47:52] you know wrap your arms around me and
[47:54] just hug me because i need
[47:56] you
[47:59] that's the way god is my bride
[48:03] i need you wrap your arms around
[48:06] me i need you we want that closer walk
[48:08] with god so how do we get it
[48:10] the bible says that the the god inhabits
[48:14] the praise of his people
[48:18] inhabit let me tell you what that word
[48:19] means i think we know but let's break it
[48:21] down
[48:22] the it means of a person or animal or
[48:24] group that lives in a country
[48:26] or to occupy a place or environment
[48:30] this is good news so when we begin to
[48:33] praise god
[48:34] we've had a horrible day we begin to
[48:36] praise god
[48:37] and when we do that something gets set
[48:39] in
[48:41] something begins to click and god begins
[48:44] to spin this in motion
[48:46] and says you know what you need a
[48:47] refilling of the holy ghost
[48:49] i need to send my spirit down to you
[48:52] because you
[48:53] are calling upon me you've praised me
[48:55] you've worshiped me
[48:56] and i'm gonna inhabit you the holy
[49:00] spirit right here
[49:03] that's an amazing thing that god lives
[49:07] right here now let me tell you
[49:11] if god lives right here
[49:15] you're in trouble you're in trouble
[49:19] but when you've praised god genuinely
[49:21] praise and worship god and that holy
[49:23] spirit comes down
[49:24] and inhabits you your life will change
[49:28] because when that happens you begin to
[49:31] get that life of joy
[49:32] love peace long suffering
[49:36] man god's good
[49:40] and when these attributes are on display
[49:44] that's when people say that's a real
[49:46] christian
[49:47] because you're christ-like you have
[49:50] praised god he's filled you with the
[49:51] spirit he's
[49:52] he's renewed your spirit within you and
[49:55] has then
[49:56] displayed himself in front of the world
[50:00] don't take me wrong here worship and
[50:03] praise is not going to save your soul
[50:06] i'm talking about if you've been saved
[50:08] born again
[50:09] filled with the holy ghost those praises
[50:11] go up
[50:12] god's down displays himself
[50:16] in your heart i mean let's face it
[50:20] can you really be angry at somebody
[50:21] while you're singing jesus
[50:24] jesus there's just something
[50:28] about that name can you get
[50:31] mad and red-faced while that's in your
[50:33] thoughts
[50:35] no no you can't do it can you be
[50:38] defeated and depressed while you're
[50:39] singing praise him
[50:41] praise him praise him in the morning
[50:45] praise him in the noon time praise him
[50:48] praise him praise him when the sun
[50:51] goes down can you be depressed
[50:55] singing that kind of song
[50:58] no worship praise
[51:01] worship giving praise one day at a time
[51:05] worship is to honor to reverence to
[51:08] respect
[51:10] to show adoration praise or glory to a
[51:12] superior being
[51:15] so i think i think god demands
[51:18] this worship i think god demands the
[51:21] worship
[51:22] and he alone is worthy of it
[51:25] you know there's something about when
[51:27] you hear your name called
[51:30] you turn around you can be sitting in a
[51:33] crowd of people and somebody say you
[51:35] know what brother brad did
[51:38] you're going to turn are you going
[51:39] rubber you'll break your neck trying to
[51:41] hear what they said about you
[51:43] and you're hoping they say something
[51:44] good and when they do you just kind of
[51:46] smile
[51:49] i'm not worthy of that god is worthy of
[51:53] that
[51:54] god is the one who is worthy that he is
[51:56] a superior being
[51:57] he's the one that demands a praise
[51:58] revelations 4 11
[52:00] answers this question pretty clear it
[52:01] says thou art worthy
[52:03] o lord to receive glory and honor
[52:07] and power for thou has created all
[52:10] all things and for
[52:13] thy pleasure are they
[52:17] and were they created
[52:20] so you're going to tell me he don't he
[52:21] don't desire he don't demand praise when
[52:23] he created us to be
[52:24] objects of praise and object of worship
[52:27] brother brown said god was not even god
[52:29] he was elohim and he created the angel
[52:32] so they would what
[52:33] worship him
[52:37] and many times many times
[52:41] with our little finite minds we get into
[52:44] a place and we fail to praise god
[52:47] because we feel like we're so unworthy
[52:50] to praise god
[52:52] why do you why do we feel that way what
[52:54] is it that makes us feel that way that
[52:55] we look around
[52:56] and we get ready to praise god we think
[52:58] i can't do it
[53:01] i did this i said this
[53:05] i went here
[53:09] resort back to the life of david
[53:12] he wasn't of all people worthy to be
[53:15] praising god
[53:16] adulterer a murderer pushed to push this
[53:19] you
[53:19] right up to the front floor of the
[53:20] battlefield to have him slaughtered
[53:24] that's that's not just murder that's
[53:25] premeditated murder he didn't do it out
[53:27] of anger
[53:28] he did it because he wanted him dead
[53:31] he's not worthy neither am i
[53:36] but there was there was a place called
[53:38] calvary
[53:40] there was a place called calvary where
[53:42] the precious blood of the lamb was shed
[53:45] and that blood was shed to wipe away all
[53:47] the sins of everybody that would ever
[53:49] believe upon
[53:51] that cross and we have to remember that
[53:55] we have to remember that and not play
[53:57] ourselves down
[53:58] but to say god i have failed you today
[54:00] miserably
[54:02] but you're still great you're still
[54:05] you're still awesome
[54:06] you're still mighty i have i've sinned
[54:09] here i failed there
[54:10] i i feel like i'm just a a poor person i
[54:13] can't even call myself a christian
[54:14] but you're still holy
[54:19] and you know what he says i'll come i'll
[54:21] come live there
[54:23] i'll come live there
[54:28] isaiah 53 familiar it's one
[54:31] for our transgressions bruised for our
[54:34] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[54:36] was upon him
[54:38] and by his stripes i'm healed
[54:44] if you never heard any other scripture
[54:46] in your life
[54:48] but that verse right there you've got a
[54:50] reason to praise god
[54:52] if that is all the knowledge you've ever
[54:54] had of the bible and somebody just
[54:55] handed you that little clip right there
[54:57] you're a blessed person
[55:01] let me read you exodus 20. exodus 20.
[55:09] says and god spake these words saying
[55:12] i am the lord thy god which have brought
[55:14] thee out of the land of egypt
[55:16] out of the house of bondage thou shall
[55:19] have no other gods
[55:20] before me thou shalt not make
[55:23] unto thee any graven image or any
[55:26] likeness of anything
[55:27] that is in heaven above or that is an
[55:29] earth beneath
[55:30] or that is a water under the earth thou
[55:33] shall not bow down
[55:35] thyselves to them nor serve them
[55:39] listen to this for i am the lord thy god
[55:44] am a jealous god
[55:50] a jealous god and i show mercy unto
[55:53] thousands of them that love me
[55:55] and keep my commandments what is a
[55:58] jealous god
[56:00] well you're his bride but god's jealousy
[56:03] is not the jealousy like we have here
[56:04] it's not that envious
[56:06] hatred bitterness green within thee
[56:09] jealousy that's not what god is but
[56:11] god's jealousy
[56:13] is a jealousy that's that was not born
[56:14] out of pride but it's born out of that
[56:17] he is the greatest
[56:19] god of all gods there could ever be
[56:23] and he wants to know that you know
[56:27] he's the one that's worthy of the glory
[56:31] his glory is so powerful it's so
[56:33] magnificent that he wants to nobody
[56:35] else can touch that glory and so he says
[56:38] i'm jealous
[56:39] if you go over here and glorify your car
[56:41] your truck your job your home your kids
[56:44] your wife
[56:48] i want the glory is what he says
[56:52] i'm the one that's worthy i'm the one
[56:54] that gave you all those
[57:00] so god expects us to worship him
[57:04] with reverence and thanksgiving
[57:08] but he also expects us to be obedient to
[57:10] him
[57:13] well we're going to get sticky i'm going
[57:15] to tell you we're going to get sticky
[57:19] god not only wants us to love him but he
[57:22] wants us to
[57:23] worship him by loving others
[57:29] that's a form of worship that's a form
[57:32] of worship he wants us to act like
[57:34] christians to each other he wants us to
[57:36] show love and compassion
[57:38] on others and consideration of others
[57:41] around us
[57:45] he wants us to present ourselves as a
[57:47] living sacrifice
[57:48] holy and pleasing to him
[57:53] and i say it gets sticky because of this
[57:55] i'll tell you what people around this
[57:57] message can be some of the meanest
[57:59] nastiest people you'll ever run into
[58:05] but yet they can quote quotes like a
[58:07] machine gun
[58:11] they wipe you out with their quotes they
[58:14] wipe you out
[58:15] with the hatred the envy the jealousy
[58:18] if you're doing something for god
[58:19] they're jealous but they got the quotes
[58:25] that's not the way god commands us to
[58:27] act
[58:29] god says to love your neighbors love
[58:31] your enemy and be holy and pleasing to
[58:33] him
[58:34] treat people as christians should treat
[58:36] people
[58:37] glorify god in doing it romans 12 tells
[58:40] us that listen it says
[58:41] to present yourself bodies a living
[58:43] sacrifice holy acceptable unto god
[58:45] which is your reasonable service
[58:48] god demands your service it's not just
[58:52] up to the preachers it's not just up to
[58:53] brother bowler to be a servant of god
[58:55] and a servant of the people it's up to
[58:56] you and i it's up to each person that
[58:59] says i'm a christian
[59:00] so what are you doing to serve god and
[59:02] serve others
[59:09] i'm gonna move on
[59:12] one writer says it this way he said we
[59:15] worship with an obedient heart
[59:17] and an open and repentant spirit listen
[59:19] to what he says happens
[59:21] god is glorified christians are purified
[59:25] the church is edified the lost are
[59:28] evangelized
[59:29] and these are the elements of true
[59:31] worship
[59:33] man we ought to long for that last soul
[59:35] to come in
[59:37] it ought to be such a spirit of
[59:38] evangelism through worship for others
[59:41] as we worship god that that last soul
[59:43] would come in
[59:44] that the church would be lifted up the
[59:46] church would be edified god was
[59:48] glorified
[59:48] [Music]
[59:51] so i personally believe that god demands
[59:54] i believe he seeks and requests our
[59:56] worship
[59:58] because he deserves it
[1:00:02] if you know if you really know christ
[1:00:05] if you really know christ there is a
[1:00:08] longing in your heart
[1:00:11] that says god i want to get in that
[1:00:14] secret place
[1:00:16] that quiet corner tucked away from the
[1:00:18] rest of the world
[1:00:21] and i want to pray i want to praise you
[1:00:24] i want to worship you i want to get
[1:00:26] myself into a place that i'm slowed down
[1:00:28] and all of my thoughts all of my mind
[1:00:30] all of my heart
[1:00:31] everything that's within me as i'm
[1:00:34] putting it on
[1:00:35] you
[1:00:40] as americans
[1:00:44] as americans we generally don't see
[1:00:46] people bowing down
[1:00:48] to idols right does your neighbors have
[1:00:51] buddha in the yard or
[1:00:53] muhammad a statue that they're bowing
[1:00:56] down to no they don't have that
[1:00:58] but in america
[1:01:01] when in america we've got money
[1:01:05] we've got success we got physical beauty
[1:01:10] sex health fitness
[1:01:13] safety security recreation drugs alcohol
[1:01:16] music
[1:01:17] sports figures
[1:01:22] that's tough on a young person because
[1:01:26] they begin to look at sports figures
[1:01:28] be careful what you look at how many
[1:01:31] knows who the greatest basketball player
[1:01:32] ever lived was number 23 michael jordan
[1:01:35] i'll give you that number 23. it's not
[1:01:36] another 23 it's the 23.
[1:01:42] he's known to be the greatest basketball
[1:01:43] player in most people's minds
[1:01:45] that ever lived and it's easy for kids
[1:01:48] to look up to him
[1:01:49] and want to be like him and want to
[1:01:51] smile like him dunk like him be like him
[1:01:54] if i could be like mike y'all remember
[1:01:56] that commercial
[1:01:57] years ago let me tell you i watched a
[1:02:00] documentary about michael jordan
[1:02:02] his teammate said he was the worst
[1:02:04] teammate they've ever played with
[1:02:06] he cussed them he abused them he
[1:02:08] actually hit somebody in the nose one
[1:02:10] time because he missed a shot and said
[1:02:11] if you ever miss another shot like it
[1:02:13] will be more to come
[1:02:15] is that who you want to be no we see the
[1:02:18] glitch the glamour the dunks
[1:02:20] the notoriety but let me tell you these
[1:02:22] people we're worshiping the wrong things
[1:02:26] that's not what we're looking around to
[1:02:27] worship
[1:02:31] you know what we choose what we worship
[1:02:35] we choose what we organize our lives
[1:02:38] around
[1:02:40] we choose what we put first we choose
[1:02:43] what we seek above all
[1:02:44] else and that's what we worship
[1:02:49] everybody wants to be successful right
[1:02:52] and that's great god wants you to be
[1:02:54] successful
[1:02:55] but are you worshiping that success
[1:02:58] god wants you to be happily married
[1:03:01] and you should adore your wife but are
[1:03:03] you worshiping your wife
[1:03:05] more than you do god vice versa husband
[1:03:09] your kids are the greatest things that
[1:03:10] god can give you outside of your wife i
[1:03:12] think
[1:03:12] i love my kids i love my boys i'm proud
[1:03:14] of them i could just go on and on about
[1:03:16] them
[1:03:17] but do i worship them i got to be
[1:03:20] careful
[1:03:21] you got to be careful we've all got to
[1:03:23] be careful what are we worshiping
[1:03:26] think about this by nature you know what
[1:03:30] by nature you know what we are
[1:03:32] worshipers of ourself
[1:03:36] worshipers of ourself we begin to seek
[1:03:39] our own welfare
[1:03:40] our own happiness we begin to seek the
[1:03:43] the greatness and the goodness in life
[1:03:46] so when that happens that god given the
[1:03:48] god-given drive to worship
[1:03:51] that's in the believer is perverted
[1:03:57] that worship that god placed in there
[1:03:59] and said draw to me
[1:04:01] it then turns to draw to ah
[1:04:06] and then it's turned upside down and
[1:04:09] your universe begins to get turned
[1:04:10] upside down
[1:04:13] so tonight i don't have to tell you that
[1:04:15] you need to worship
[1:04:17] i just need to ask you what you're
[1:04:18] worshiping what are you worshiping what
[1:04:21] are you drawing close
[1:04:23] let's get close to jesus let's put god
[1:04:25] first
[1:04:26] listen to saint john 4 19 what jesus
[1:04:29] told the woman at the
[1:04:31] well in samaria you know the story
[1:04:34] brother branham hit it many times
[1:04:35] talking about you have five wives the
[1:04:37] one you're living with now is not
[1:04:39] yours and so on and when he told her
[1:04:42] that she said sir
[1:04:43] i perceive thou art a prophet
[1:04:46] and she said our fathers worshiped in
[1:04:49] this mountain
[1:04:50] and ye say that in jerusalem is the
[1:04:52] place that men are to worship
[1:04:54] and jesus said unto her woman believe me
[1:04:57] the hour cometh
[1:04:58] when you shall neither in this mountain
[1:05:00] nor yet at jerusalem
[1:05:01] worship the father you worship you know
[1:05:04] not what
[1:05:05] we know what we worship for salvation is
[1:05:07] of the jews
[1:05:08] but the hour cometh and is and now is
[1:05:11] when the true worshipers shall
[1:05:13] worship the father in spirit and in
[1:05:15] truth
[1:05:16] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:05:19] him
[1:05:20] that's why it's so important that we
[1:05:22] follow the true
[1:05:23] word and message of the hour because
[1:05:27] god is seeking such a person that with
[1:05:29] worship and spirit of truth
[1:05:31] and worship him and this woman was so
[1:05:34] astounded she knew immediately
[1:05:36] and said i know that the messiah cometh
[1:05:40] because of what he said about her
[1:05:41] worshiping and how the worship would be
[1:05:44] so what does it mean it means god
[1:05:45] doesn't care about where you worship
[1:05:49] what kind of building you're worshiping
[1:05:50] and it don't matter if you're in the
[1:05:52] mountains it don't matter if you're in
[1:05:52] jerusalem
[1:05:53] it don't matter if you got a thousand
[1:05:54] dollar suit on god
[1:05:56] don't care but what god does cared about
[1:06:01] care about
[1:06:06] as if you appear to be devout
[1:06:10] sincere and pious the pharisees the
[1:06:13] sadducees
[1:06:15] dressed in the best of clothes looked
[1:06:18] the part they played the part they spoke
[1:06:20] the part
[1:06:22] but it was all a fake
[1:06:27] it was all a fake so god won't be food
[1:06:32] comes from the inside
[1:06:34] because if it's just on the outside like
[1:06:36] i said on this flesh
[1:06:38] it's empty and worthless to god
[1:06:43] he don't like fake worship
[1:06:47] i'm going to paraphrase here isaiah 29
[1:06:52] these people come near to me with their
[1:06:54] mouth
[1:06:55] and honor me with their lips but their
[1:06:58] hearts
[1:06:58] are far from me
[1:07:04] that's not what god wants
[1:07:08] the only kind of worshiper god can use
[1:07:11] is the ones that worship from here we
[1:07:14] keep going back to here
[1:07:17] it's got to be from here
[1:07:20] sometimes you've seen it and you know it
[1:07:22] you've done it i've done it
[1:07:24] you're singing the songs of praise but
[1:07:26] your heart's as cold
[1:07:28] as ice are you lukewarm
[1:07:32] you're not worshiping you're just
[1:07:33] singing a song yeah
[1:07:35] i don't want somebody to say he's a
[1:07:37] singer and i tell everybody i'm not a
[1:07:39] singer
[1:07:39] but i'm a worshiper i can't sing a lick
[1:07:43] i get off key my voice cracks i go here
[1:07:46] there sometimes i can't get up
[1:07:47] but if i sit behind sister johnny she'll
[1:07:49] probably tell you i'm singing i'm doing
[1:07:51] something i'm worshiping
[1:07:53] it may hurt her ears but god's loving it
[1:07:56] god don't care if you're off-key god
[1:07:59] don't care if you know how to sing
[1:08:01] he wants you to put forth some effort
[1:08:03] and sacrifice
[1:08:04] he wants you to say i love you god i'm
[1:08:07] going to give everything to you
[1:08:08] during this hour of praise
[1:08:17] you know how it is your body's here your
[1:08:19] mouth is moving
[1:08:20] your face is smiling you're clapping
[1:08:26] and nothing you're not engaged with god
[1:08:31] you're not engaged with him it's like
[1:08:33] you just went out there and started your
[1:08:34] truck
[1:08:36] revving it up you ain't going nowhere
[1:08:40] until you pull it down into gear and
[1:08:42] engage the transmission
[1:08:45] we have to engage the transmission we
[1:08:48] have to be able to get close to god
[1:08:50] because if not the next thing you know
[1:08:51] you're sitting there and you find the
[1:08:53] sermon is boring
[1:08:58] y'all quiet hey i've been up here and
[1:09:01] i've been out there
[1:09:02] and i know i know how it goes the
[1:09:05] sermon's boring
[1:09:06] it's tedious it's my tone you can't wait
[1:09:09] for that preacher to get done
[1:09:11] is he ever going to say let's stand
[1:09:16] i think he's done i think he's about to
[1:09:17] finish now he's got two more quotes
[1:09:20] i'm ready to go home
[1:09:23] brother you ever seen this
[1:09:27] the watchers
[1:09:32] brother brown said it's separating time
[1:09:34] just made god
[1:09:35] sick at his stomach man i don't want to
[1:09:39] be guilty of that
[1:09:41] i don't want nothing i don't want god to
[1:09:42] ever look at me and say dad you make me
[1:09:44] sick
[1:09:45] can you imagine it would hurt you if
[1:09:47] somebody come up to you personally and
[1:09:48] you knew
[1:09:49] and they just come up to you said you
[1:09:50] know what you make me sick
[1:09:53] what if god did that i don't want to be
[1:09:56] guilty
[1:09:57] of making god sick but listen what he
[1:10:00] says
[1:10:00] he said it's the joy unspeakable and
[1:10:03] full of glory
[1:10:04] how old saints of god used to sit around
[1:10:07] and sing redemption songs and sing of
[1:10:09] the blood
[1:10:10] and the power of god and today we're
[1:10:12] cold as zero
[1:10:19] listen now he says you don't see their
[1:10:21] faces light up
[1:10:24] you don't see their faces light up no
[1:10:25] more and you don't see them sing and
[1:10:27] clap their hands they don't raise their
[1:10:28] hands to god
[1:10:29] they don't praise god they don't pray
[1:10:30] all night they don't lay in the
[1:10:32] cornfields
[1:10:36] man we're not trying to be fanatical
[1:10:39] please don't misunders
[1:10:40] listen and and take me there we're not
[1:10:42] trying to be fanatical
[1:10:44] but we have to do a little better with
[1:10:45] praising god we have to do a little
[1:10:47] better to give god what is duly his
[1:10:50] so you say how do i fix that how do i
[1:10:52] fix that
[1:10:55] i've got it you fix it
[1:10:59] by not coming to church at 10 30 on
[1:11:02] sunday morning

[1:11:11] you fix it by not not waiting till 10 30
[1:11:14] on sunday morning to get ready for
[1:11:15] worship

[1:11:18] an hour just to get one
[1:11:20] warmed up to get your mind set on god it
[1:11:24] takes at least half an hour that's why
[1:11:25] the prophet said to come to church
[1:11:27] early 20 30 minutes before and pray and
[1:11:29] read and meditate
[1:11:30] and get ready for the worship of god

[1:11:52] get rid of the attitude
[1:11:53] where your husband says something to you
[1:11:54] last night that you didn't like
[1:11:57] it takes 30 minutes for your husbands to
[1:11:58] get over the burnt toast you had for
[1:12:00] breakfast

[1:13:04] guidelines that we come from maybe two
[1:13:06] hours a day two and a half
[1:13:08] three hours on a sunday once a week
[1:13:12] and wednesday night for a couple of
[1:13:13] hours is that too much to ask
[1:13:17] no i don't think so you remember calvary
[1:13:19] don't you
[1:13:20] that was a lot to ask for but coming to
[1:13:23] church a few nights a week not a lot to
[1:13:24] ask for
[1:13:25] so get up early read a psalm listen to
[1:13:27] some worship music start the process a
[1:13:29] couple of hours ahead of time
[1:13:32] and get yourself motivated and ready to
[1:13:35] worship
[1:13:36] god and say god i know know exactly what
[1:13:40] what i need from you today but i know
[1:13:41] you do i know god that you can come down
[1:13:44] and speak to
[1:13:46] my heart lord i'll i'm going to ask and
[1:13:48] i'm going to
[1:13:49] commit myself for the rest of this day
[1:13:52] for you to speak to me so that i can
[1:13:54] give back to you
[1:13:58] if you do that it'll transform your
[1:14:00] worship experience
[1:14:02] if you do that you'll live a different
[1:14:03] kind of life on sunday god will speak to
[1:14:05] you in ways you've never been spoken to
[1:14:08] yeah but you know what you don't have to
[1:14:11] wait till sunday
[1:14:13] you can start on saturday night what
[1:14:16] would you what would happen if we
[1:14:17] started everybody in this building
[1:14:19] started meditating
[1:14:20] on the word and praying and dedicating
[1:14:24] and committing ourselves
[1:14:25] to god on saturday night for a sunday
[1:14:28] morning service
[1:14:30] what would happen it's a wonder isn't it
[1:14:33] because we don't know
[1:14:36] let me ask you this what would happen
[1:14:39] if every day of the week we prayed for
[1:14:42] sunday morning service
[1:14:46] if every day of the week we meditated we
[1:14:48] prayed we played music we listened we
[1:14:50] asked god we talk to god we commune with
[1:14:52] god
[1:14:52] and then see what he would have for us
[1:14:53] on sunday morning what do you think
[1:14:55] would happen
[1:14:56] it would transform your worship it would
[1:14:58] transform this
[1:14:59] church and we would go to places you've
[1:15:03] never seen before
[1:15:08] you say man he's put a lot of pressure
[1:15:11] on us
[1:15:12] what would happen if the preacher didn't
[1:15:14] prepare for service
[1:15:17] what did brother baller come in here on
[1:15:18] sunday morning and say well
[1:15:20] i want to sleep in a little bit this
[1:15:22] morning
[1:15:24] i think i'll just go here
[1:15:28] at 10 30 walk out here and say this is
[1:15:30] what we're going to talk about today
[1:15:31] what do you think that was
[1:15:32] let me tell you it'd be chaos because he
[1:15:35] wouldn't be in tune the preacher's got
[1:15:36] to be in tune with god
[1:15:38] he's got to dedicate himself and get
[1:15:39] into a quiet place and seek what god
[1:15:41] would have for the people
[1:15:52] romans 12 i want to read the second
[1:15:54] verse we've read the first one earlier
[1:15:55] and be not conformed to this world
[1:15:59] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:16:02] your mind
[1:16:04] that you may prove what that is good and
[1:16:07] acceptable
[1:16:08] and perfect will of god
[1:16:13] so we've talked about some fleshly
[1:16:14] things we've talked about our heart
[1:16:16] where does that leave our mind where
[1:16:19] does that leave our mind
[1:16:20] because we sometimes take for granted
[1:16:22] the power of our mind
[1:16:24] our mind is one of the most powerful
[1:16:26] things in the universe
[1:16:28] so why you know that's why brother
[1:16:29] branham says the greatest battle ever
[1:16:32] fault
[1:16:32] is between our ears because it's a
[1:16:35] constant battle going on in our minds
[1:16:37] and our mind is telling you you're right
[1:16:39] or you're wrong or you're this or you're
[1:16:40] that and without your mind being in the
[1:16:42] right place how can you focus on god
[1:16:48] has anybody ever had something on your
[1:16:51] mind
[1:16:52] and you can't sleep for two or three
[1:16:53] hours and you're
[1:16:55] dead tired but you lay there and you lay
[1:16:57] there and you lay there because you
[1:16:59] can't get off your
[1:17:00] mind and you're running scenarios
[1:17:03] through your mind and through your mind
[1:17:04] over and over you're trying to fix
[1:17:06] problems that don't even exist in your
[1:17:08] mind
[1:17:10] it'll cause you not to eat it'll cause
[1:17:12] you not to sleep
[1:17:13] it'll cause you to to be depressed
[1:17:16] the mind is a powerful thing i've been
[1:17:20] reading a book
[1:17:22] it's a it's got about 13 or 14 mental
[1:17:26] coaches that coach college and pro
[1:17:28] athletes in baseball
[1:17:31] and i've been reading how these guys
[1:17:32] approach the mind
[1:17:34] of the baseball game and reading in this
[1:17:38] i look and they say that what separates
[1:17:40] the player
[1:17:42] from the professional player is their
[1:17:44] mental game
[1:17:46] so there's thousands and thousands and
[1:17:48] thousands of players
[1:17:49] that play baseball and out of these
[1:17:51] thousands and thousands of players other
[1:17:53] sports basketball
[1:17:54] any sport you want to name there's a lot
[1:17:56] of people thousands of them that are
[1:17:57] talented enough
[1:17:58] or skilled enough are genetically built
[1:18:01] and able and strong enough
[1:18:03] to play at the professional level
[1:18:07] but you know how many make it one
[1:18:10] percent
[1:18:12] you know why they can't make it it's all
[1:18:15] here
[1:18:16] they've got everything it takes to be
[1:18:18] one of the greatest players ever
[1:18:20] but mentally they can't focus mentally
[1:18:23] they can't get into the game
[1:18:24] mentally they can't hit the ball
[1:18:26] mentally they can't
[1:18:27] can't do make the plays mentally they
[1:18:30] can't shoot the basketball mentally they
[1:18:31] can't hit the golf shot
[1:18:36] so what does that mean to the christian
[1:18:38] this is what they say okay
[1:18:40] i'm talking i'm talking sports but i'm
[1:18:41] gonna bring it down to our lives
[1:18:43] they say that when a pitcher a
[1:18:44] professional pitcher pitches in a game
[1:18:47] he's throwing a baseball average
[1:18:48] nowadays professional probably 90 miles
[1:18:50] an hour
[1:18:52] okay that's probably the average 90
[1:18:55] miles an hour
[1:18:56] your eyes have one millisecond
[1:18:59] to adjust to the pitch and see if you
[1:19:01] can hit it that's quick
[1:19:04] but that pitcher before he delivers
[1:19:06] every pitch in his mind
[1:19:08] he's not looking at the mitt he's not
[1:19:10] looking at the batter he's not looking
[1:19:11] at the coach
[1:19:13] he's looking in his mind and seeing the
[1:19:14] picture of the baseball
[1:19:17] and the path it takes to get to where
[1:19:19] it's got to go he sees it from his hand
[1:19:22] to the mitt he's mentally focused
[1:19:25] he's so in tune with what he's doing in
[1:19:28] his mind he's going to physically place
[1:19:30] that ball in the mid
[1:19:33] the batter has got one millisecond to
[1:19:35] make a decision is it's a curveball
[1:19:37] or a fastball can i hit it is it a
[1:19:39] strike is it high is it low
[1:19:42] but in his mind he's thinking see the
[1:19:44] ball
[1:19:45] hit the ball in tune
[1:19:48] with what they're doing so what does
[1:19:49] that mean for the christian
[1:19:52] it means that when you're listening to a
[1:19:54] message
[1:19:56] tune in to that message focus on that
[1:19:59] message
[1:20:00] when that then you're into an act of
[1:20:02] worship because then you've committed
[1:20:04] yourself
[1:20:05] once that picture lets the ball go he's
[1:20:07] committed to where it flies
[1:20:11] commit yourself to the word when you're
[1:20:13] so into
[1:20:14] when you hear the word when you're
[1:20:15] praying commit to praying these mental
[1:20:18] coaches they say
[1:20:19] a baseball player is a lot of things
[1:20:22] when he's in school
[1:20:23] he's a student so he should be 100
[1:20:26] focused on being a student
[1:20:30] when he's in the game when he's hitting
[1:20:32] he's 100
[1:20:34] mentally focused on hitting he's not a
[1:20:36] student anymore
[1:20:38] he's 100 focused on hitting when he's in
[1:20:40] the field he's 100
[1:20:42] focused on being a fielder he's not a
[1:20:44] hitter anymore he's not a student
[1:20:45] anymore
[1:20:47] so why wouldn't we when we're praying
[1:20:50] why wouldn't we say i'm going to focus
[1:20:52] 100
[1:20:54] on this prayer i'm going to focus and
[1:20:57] dedicate 100
[1:20:58] on this prayer
[1:21:03] an act of worship you know worship's not
[1:21:06] always singing
[1:21:08] and in our minds we think that because
[1:21:10] it's songs of praise and worship
[1:21:13] but there's more to worship you can
[1:21:15] engage your mind with scriptures
[1:21:17] as an act of worship you can discuss a
[1:21:20] sermon or message with your husband or
[1:21:22] wife
[1:21:22] as an act of worship
[1:21:25] there's many ways to worship god i've
[1:21:28] got one last illustration
[1:21:30] that i want to speak on focus
[1:21:35] how focused we are and how in tuned we
[1:21:37] are is how close
[1:21:38] we can be with god and we don't want to
[1:21:41] miss the mark
[1:21:43] there was a story i read about some
[1:21:46] scientists that were
[1:21:47] uh doctors they were sports and now or
[1:21:50] sports scientists whatever
[1:21:51] but they want to see how how important
[1:21:54] the mind was
[1:21:56] in anything they do so they picked a guy
[1:21:58] that throws darts you know the guys
[1:22:00] you throw the darts and tournaments you
[1:22:01] know hits the bullseye
[1:22:04] we all know we're talking about right
[1:22:06] okay so this guy's a professional dart
[1:22:08] thrower and he could sit up there and
[1:22:10] throw darts right-handed all day long
[1:22:12] and hit the bullseye
[1:22:14] but they told him they said what we want
[1:22:15] you to do is take a hundred darts
[1:22:18] left-handed and we want you to throw
[1:22:20] left-handed
[1:22:22] so he threw a hundred darts left-handed
[1:22:25] and he put them in a circle they said i
[1:22:27] seen the guys video in a circle about
[1:22:29] this big
[1:22:31] and they said now we don't want you to
[1:22:32] touch a dart
[1:22:34] for a month we don't want you to touch
[1:22:37] for a month but every day we want you to
[1:22:39] spend 15 minutes
[1:22:41] and we want you to see that dart leaving
[1:22:43] your hand
[1:22:44] and hitting the bullseye 15 minutes
[1:22:47] every day for a month so that's what he
[1:22:49] did
[1:22:50] he dedicated himself for 15 minutes
[1:22:52] every day to see that dart hit the
[1:22:54] bullseye
[1:22:55] they came back one month later
[1:22:58] and said we want you to throw 100 darts
[1:23:01] with your left hand
[1:23:03] so he stands up boom
[1:23:06] 100 this time his circle was this big
[1:23:11] now you tell me the mind is not a
[1:23:12] powerful thing
[1:23:14] what do you set your mind on i'm not i'm
[1:23:17] not up here preaching mind over matter
[1:23:19] i'm talking about mind focused and
[1:23:21] dedicated on god
[1:23:23] how close can we get to hitting a target
[1:23:26] i don't want to miss the target
[1:23:28] i don't want to miss the mark in my life
[1:23:30] i want to make sure that i'm
[1:23:31] in tune that i'm focused and i'm
[1:23:33] thinking more on christ
[1:23:34] and then i'm lifting him up more i'm
[1:23:36] exalting him more and i'm singing his
[1:23:38] praises and worshiping god
[1:23:43] if you do that you're more likely to
[1:23:46] become more like him
[1:23:48] if you do that you're more likely to hit
[1:23:50] the mark
[1:23:53] that's simple that's simple
[1:23:56] so don't make it hard don't make this
[1:23:59] hard
[1:24:00] don't make living a christian life hard
[1:24:02] just worship
[1:24:04] it's that simple do you want to be like
[1:24:06] christ do you want to have his peace his
[1:24:07] love his joy
