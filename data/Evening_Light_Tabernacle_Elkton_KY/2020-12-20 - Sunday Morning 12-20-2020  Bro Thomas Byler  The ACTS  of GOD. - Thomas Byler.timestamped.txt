[50:06] amen so god bless you amen you can be
[50:08] seated for a minute
[50:12] amen this morning we want to make an
[50:14] announcement
[50:15] amen and something that i've been kind
[50:18] of looking forward to for a while
[50:21] and praying about amen and i know
[50:23] brother brad's been praying about it
[50:25] and brother brad and sister joyce how
[50:27] many appreciates them and their family
[50:30] i know they've uh the last decade or so
[50:33] uh all of us we've all went through many
[50:36] different trials i mean
[50:38] and i know they have and they have went
[50:40] through
[50:41] times they perhaps didn't know which way
[50:43] to go and what to do and
[50:44] i have certainly been there but thank
[50:47] you micah
[50:48] but this morning and uh we've been
[50:50] praying about it and i have talked to
[50:51] brother brad
[50:53] and and we feel that at this time amen i
[50:56] know
[50:57] brother brad's been out of the ministry
[50:58] for quite a few years
[51:00] and you know he used to minister for the
[51:02] lord and so
[51:04] he hasn't been doing it for a while and
[51:05] we know that even brother branham went
[51:07] off the field for a while because of
[51:08] things so that's not something that
[51:09] don't happen but
[51:13] we feel like he's still got a gift in
[51:14] his life that he could be a blessing to
[51:16] the bride of jesus christ
[51:18] amen and us here amen so uh
[51:22] i've talked to him and we both feel like
[51:24] it would be pleasing to the holy spirit
[51:25] and that the lord would bless
[51:27] him in him getting back into the
[51:28] ministry amen
[51:31] so i hope everybody would support that
[51:33] amen and certainly if we feel like
[51:36] it'll be pleasing to the lord and so and
[51:39] you know the one the one thing i see
[51:40] about this
[51:42] is that you know we me and brother brad
[51:44] we've had our differences
[51:45] hello we've had our separations
[51:48] but you know the one thing our prophet
[51:50] taught us and that is that
[51:52] it doesn't matter who you are if both of
[51:54] those people will get back under the
[51:55] blood of jesus christ
[51:57] it will bring them back together it will
[52:00] absolutely bring them back together
[52:02] and all differences are all gone all of
[52:03] that is and
[52:05] and when i was speaking to him i asked
[52:06] forgiveness for anything i have he said
[52:08] no there is nothing there
[52:10] in the same way with him it's all
[52:11] covered by the blood
[52:13] as brothers if you get things under the
[52:15] blood of jesus christ
[52:16] you can be genuine brothers again but if
[52:19] you don't get it under the blood
[52:21] you know it's not that way amen but
[52:23] anything that
[52:24] gets under the blood it gets taken care
[52:26] of and i believe that and i think this
[52:28] is a
[52:29] a real milestone it's a great thing amen
[52:32] and so we just really appreciate them
[52:36] and we pray that the lord will just
[52:38] bless them their family their two boys
[52:40] god has already blessed them amen he's
[52:42] been good to him amen he's got
[52:44] a beautiful place he's given them over
[52:46] here real close to the church and so
[52:47] forth
[52:48] um and so we appreciate amen the
[52:51] blessing that they have been here
[52:53] and are and so we look forward to some
[52:55] more time in january perhaps you know
[52:57] get started
[52:58] and looking forward to you know having
[53:01] him minister again perhaps as an
[53:02] evangelist
[53:03] amen uh and also help here at the church
[53:06] so
[53:07] that's really wonderful amen
[53:10] so if you will i'll stand with me when i
[53:12] have him come up we're gonna have the
[53:13] elders of the church and
[53:15] just pray over him and bless him and ask
[53:17] god to just bless him in that
[53:19] in his ministry amen
[53:22] i guess brother williams going for david
[53:29] amen god bless you brother love you
[53:31] brother

[53:35] just pray
[53:36] god's blessing upon him each one just
[53:38] bow your heads and pray for brother brad
[53:40] and his family for his ministry and that
[53:42] god will have his way our heavenly
[53:44] father lord jesus as we have prayed
[53:46] about this we've committed to you in
[53:47] such
[53:48] your perfect will father we just feel
[53:50] god at this time it'd be a good time

[53:55] harness lord
[53:56] to be a blessing to your people father
[53:59] not only here but wherever he would go
[54:01] god that he would bring souls to you
[54:03] that he would be edifying to the body of
[54:05] christ
[54:06] part of the fivefold ministry lord we
[54:08] ask god any any
[54:10] fault any failures on any of our parts
[54:12] put it all under the blood lord
[54:13] and help us to serve you in a greater
[54:15] measure than what we have lord
[54:17] bless my brother in the name of jesus
[54:19] christ may his ministry prosper
[54:21] lord and be blessed we ask god for his
[54:24] family that you would bless them lord
[54:25] jesus for we know lord
[54:27] when you're on the front line satan
[54:29] won't like that lord and father i just
[54:31] pray a special blessing upon him lord in
[54:33] his ministry now lord anoint him lord to
[54:35] minister your word
[54:37] to stay with the prophet to say with you
[54:39] a word to say only what the prophet said
[54:41] say only what the bible says and to stay
[54:43] with you father and to your people lord
[54:45] may he be a blessing now we ask it in
[54:47] the name of jesus christ
[54:49] amen and amen thank you lord jesus
[54:52] thank you
[54:58] ame man god is good isn't he
[55:12] i would like to have all the heads of
[55:15] each family
[55:16] after service after it's dismissed you
[55:19] mean to stay
[55:21] i want to have a talk with each
[55:23] basically a men's meeting
[55:26] after service we just have some
[55:27] information we want to share with you
[55:30] amen so if you would just stay and it's
[55:33] just some information it's nothing major
[55:35] but we just want to share some
[55:36] information with you
[55:38] and so god bless you and the rest of you
[55:40] most of you will probably find out what
[55:42] it's all about
[55:44] and so just put that in your pocket and
[55:46] don't worry about it during service
[55:48] amen amen and we'll just want to have
[55:51] the holy spirit to have his way
[55:54] i mean last friday saturday not this one
[55:57] but before
[55:58] i mean i came down with something i went
[56:00] to um
[56:05] what was the place called home depot
[56:08] thank you
[56:09] home depot to get some sealer and so
[56:11] forth and
[56:13] you know i went in there got my material
[56:15] and everything and on the way out
[56:17] there's a girl that stopped me beginning
[56:19] to talk to me and i had two big old five
[56:21] gallon buckets of sealer and
[56:23] and she tried to sell me something and i
[56:25] said i'm not interested ma'am i got to
[56:26] go
[56:27] and i started what kept walking and she
[56:29] kept talking
[56:30] i said well you know if she keep talking
[56:32] i said i'll be a
[56:33] gentleman and i turn around set my about
[56:35] buckets down and
[56:37] talk to her but she was up pretty close
[56:39] and so
[56:40] anyway at the end of it all i says well
[56:42] i'm just not really interested at all
[56:44] you know how it is but
[56:45] i always thought it was kind of peculiar
[56:47] that they'd have somebody get up in your
[56:48] face like that
[56:50] during this time you know and but anyway
[56:52] uh
[56:53] i feel like maybe i picked it up there i
[56:55] don't know what it was but
[56:56] i know it was some uh it was you know it
[56:59] was something that others
[57:01] i've had have had and they've been
[57:03] diagnosed with the cove
[57:05] but in it but you know i don't know
[57:08] whether it was or not i don't really
[57:09] think it was but
[57:10] there's so many symptoms they claim that
[57:12] come with it you never know for sure so
[57:14] we were really really sick threw up
[57:16] about seven
[57:18] eight times and i think when i got the
[57:19] last of the acid finally thrilled up
[57:22] you know my stomach after a period of
[57:24] time turned and
[57:25] and you know of course i would take pep
[57:26] the bismol and any kind of drink you
[57:28] would drink he just all came right back
[57:30] up but
[57:30] it just i could feel when it turned and
[57:32] so uh
[57:33] you know i was glad we never did but it
[57:36] was like a 24-hour
[57:37] virus that we had and and i was very
[57:40] glad that it wasn't anything worse
[57:41] because i know
[57:42] i've talked to troy and robin and i know
[57:44] william and different ones
[57:46] natalie all even michelle different ones
[57:48] have had
[57:49] a five or six day fever and you know
[57:51] that's rough when you've got
[57:52] anything for five or six days or even
[57:54] eight days and uh better stephen
[57:56] michelle
[57:58] you know really feel for them and system
[57:59] sister michelle especially
[58:01] because she's had it first seems like a
[58:02] long time but um
[58:04] so you know but i'm just thankful the
[58:06] lord's delivering us amen
[58:08] and that we're getting to feeling better
[58:10] and so
[58:13] we just pray for those that have had it
[58:15] we thank god for healing those who've
[58:16] had it amen and over it
[58:18] and so i know i hadn't been that sick in
[58:20] that way probably in about a decade it
[58:22] was been a long time since i
[58:24] you know felt that sick but i was just
[58:26] very glad it didn't last longer than it
[58:28] did with the help of the lord
[58:30] so amen um other than that i
[58:34] can't think of any anything um
[58:37] any other announcements or anything so
[58:40] let's just bow our heads
[58:41] enter into the service this morning kind
[58:44] heavenly father we come before you lord
[58:46] once again lord thankful
[58:48] and during this christmas season during
[58:50] this
[58:51] winter time lord jesus to be able to
[58:53] assemble ourselves together in your name
[58:56] knowing god that wherever two or three
[58:57] are gathered in
[58:58] there you will be in our midst lord
[59:01] jesus and that's truly what we're so
[59:02] grateful for father
[59:04] is that you're with us even in us to the
[59:06] end of the age
[59:10] father we just do pray for each one once
[59:12] again lord
[59:13] both those that are recovering perhaps
[59:15] those who are not feeling well we ask
[59:17] for the grace of god
[59:18] to go to them lord and just to raise
[59:20] them up lord we believe lord that by
[59:22] your stripes they are healed
[59:24] we each one father we thank you lord
[59:25] jesus for the healing properties lord of
[59:28] uh the healing power of almighty god
[59:30] that comes to us and heals us lord
[59:33] we ask god that you'll take lord what i
[59:35] feel lord you've laid upon my heart to
[59:36] speak this morning help us lord just
[59:38] by the power of your spirit to say what
[59:40] you once said lord but most of all
[59:42] father
[59:42] we want you to come in a special way and
[59:44] speak to us along the way that we could
[59:46] go from here
[59:47] saying did not our hearts burn within us
[59:49] as he spoke to us
[59:50] along the way we love you lord jesus
[59:52] with all of our heart we're so grateful
[59:54] to be able to assemble ourselves
[59:55] together
[59:56] having the freedom to do so knowing that
[59:58] it's been prophesied that some day these
[1:00:00] things places
[1:00:01] will be shut down lord so we do
[1:00:02] appreciate we cherish
[1:00:04] these times together when we can open
[1:00:07] your word lord the infallible
[1:00:09] unfailing eternal word of god
[1:00:13] we ask god that we go from here better
[1:00:14] people than what we've come closer to
[1:00:16] you lord jesus
[1:00:18] more surrender to you lord we ask god
[1:00:20] that you'll just speak now father in the
[1:00:22] name of jesus christ
[1:00:24] amen and amen turn your bibles if you
[1:00:26] will to psalms 127.
[1:00:44] if i was to call it a christmas message
[1:00:46] this would be my christmas message
[1:00:49] amen in psalms 127
[1:00:52] and we want to take the first verse
[1:00:58] except the lord built the house they
[1:01:00] labor in vain
[1:01:01] that built it except the lord keep the
[1:01:04] city
[1:01:05] the watchman wakeeth but in vain
[1:01:08] may god have its blessings to the
[1:01:09] reading of the words you can be seated
[1:01:11] this morning
[1:01:14] i want to speak for a little while on
[1:01:15] the acts
[1:01:17] the acts of god a-c-t-s
[1:01:21] the acts of god amen
[1:01:27] and what brought me to this was
[1:01:30] meditation and thinking about the lord
[1:01:35] and thinking about what god really does
[1:01:37] for us
[1:01:39] amen and
[1:01:42] you know and how that without him and
[1:01:46] unless it is him doing it
[1:01:48] it's really not worth a whole lot
[1:01:51] amen for example just meeting here
[1:01:54] coming together taking our time
[1:01:57] getting ourselves ready coming to church
[1:02:00] but you know if it wasn't for the lord
[1:02:02] coming and meeting us
[1:02:03] with us this morning it would be in vain
[1:02:06] it wouldn't really mean a lot would it
[1:02:09] now
[1:02:09] i say that because we do realize that
[1:02:12] there is
[1:02:14] enormous amounts of people that are
[1:02:16] doing that this morning
[1:02:18] that are meeting in vain amen
[1:02:22] because our prophet taught us and
[1:02:24] preached a message called
[1:02:25] doing god a service without it being his
[1:02:27] will
[1:02:28] is that right so many people are
[1:02:32] worshiping the lord they're serving the
[1:02:34] lord they're
[1:02:35] doing whatever they think is right
[1:02:38] whatever they think that the lord once
[1:02:40] done
[1:02:40] isn't that right but yet in that
[1:02:43] it's still of no use
[1:02:49] you know because if you'll remember the
[1:02:51] bible says you know in that day they'll
[1:02:53] come
[1:02:53] say heaven we prophesied and have we
[1:02:55] done many mighty works in your name
[1:02:58] and he'll confess what
[1:03:01] depart from me i never knew you so they
[1:03:05] did do a lot
[1:03:06] people do a lot for the lord amen but
[1:03:09] they do it perhaps the way they want to
[1:03:11] do it or the way they think it should be
[1:03:13] done
[1:03:14] how many knows that's not acceptable to
[1:03:16] god god didn't have to ask you how it
[1:03:19] should be done
[1:03:21] no or where or how god doesn't do what
[1:03:24] he wants it done
[1:03:26] amen and it'll be it's going to be a sad
[1:03:28] day now let's talk about this
[1:03:30] for just a few minutes let's talk about
[1:03:31] this part where he says that you know
[1:03:37] how it says that except the lord
[1:03:40] keep the city let me just read the first
[1:03:43] part of it except
[1:03:44] the lord built the house they labor
[1:03:47] in vain
[1:03:52] so people can do things but that labor
[1:03:55] is in vain if god
[1:03:58] is not in it if it isn't the will of god
[1:04:02] remember it's all in vain
[1:04:06] no matter what you do if it is in the
[1:04:09] will of god
[1:04:11] then it's in vain how many knows you can
[1:04:14] do a service of god a god of service
[1:04:16] without it being his will
[1:04:18] and then you're really not serving god
[1:04:20] you may appease your mind you may think
[1:04:22] that you are but you're really not
[1:04:25] amen i like a little plaque that my wife
[1:04:29] bought
[1:04:30] brought it in the house and now you know
[1:04:32] she's always getting these easy as a
[1:04:33] whatnot woman you know she's a lot of
[1:04:35] whatnot
[1:04:36] but i like what she got now on this
[1:04:38] little plaque it said
[1:04:39] pray about
[1:04:42] everything i mean please that's what you
[1:04:46] got you gotta pray
[1:04:47] about everything
[1:04:50] praise the lord and then my mind went
[1:04:54] over to paul
[1:04:57] in first corinthians the ninth chapter
[1:05:02] because how many know that paul didn't
[1:05:04] want to run this race
[1:05:05] in vain there's really not any
[1:05:09] any good in doing anything that is vain
[1:05:12] that is in lame
[1:05:15] amen for naught paul wanted to make sure
[1:05:18] he didn't run
[1:05:19] in vain and so he talked about the race
[1:05:23] that he was running he says no ye not
[1:05:25] that they which
[1:05:26] run in a race run off but run receiveth
[1:05:29] the prize
[1:05:30] so run that you may
[1:05:33] obtain praise the lord
[1:05:37] how many of us that's if you do anything
[1:05:39] if you have any purpose in anything
[1:05:41] you want to achieve that purpose
[1:05:45] not get there halfway not get there
[1:05:48] almost and then still not get
[1:05:50] there now i know there's two million
[1:05:53] two million of the israelites that hates
[1:05:56] they started in the race they started to
[1:05:58] run
[1:05:59] amen and i believe in first corinthians
[1:06:02] paul
[1:06:02] in the next chapter talked about how did
[1:06:04] they drank from the same spiritual rock
[1:06:07] they were all under the pillar of fire
[1:06:09] they all came out of egypt they all went
[1:06:11] that far
[1:06:12] but they never obtained
[1:06:19] you know as we get older we just don't
[1:06:22] like to do things
[1:06:24] and fail in it isn't that right
[1:06:28] we don't like to fail when you set out
[1:06:31] to do something you like to
[1:06:33] get your achievement that's the way paul
[1:06:37] was if i'm going to start this
[1:06:39] then i want to i want to finish this
[1:06:42] race
[1:06:44] i want to go all the way
[1:06:48] amen so now we're getting on down here
[1:06:52] every man that striveth for the mastery
[1:06:54] is tempered in all things now they
[1:06:56] do it for to obtain a corruptable crown
[1:07:00] but we are incorruptable there i
[1:07:03] therefore so run not as
[1:07:05] i uncertainty so fight i
[1:07:09] and this is where i want to get to not
[1:07:12] as
[1:07:12] one that beateth the air
[1:07:18] amen it you know when you don't
[1:07:20] accomplish your
[1:07:22] mission it's pretty much as good as
[1:07:26] nothing
[1:07:29] i mean you think about i think about
[1:07:30] beating the air
[1:07:36] what have i done are we getting anything
[1:07:39] done at all
[1:07:41] hello
[1:07:44] no yeah it's it's viewed out
[1:07:47] sure the wind's moving if it was smokey
[1:07:50] here
[1:07:50] and you swished your hand through it
[1:07:52] sure it would make an effect
[1:07:54] you could see it isn't that right
[1:07:57] but it's pretty much paul was saying not
[1:08:00] one that just
[1:08:01] is speeding the air he in his heart he
[1:08:05] wanted
[1:08:06] amen some substance he wanted a man to
[1:08:08] obtain
[1:08:09] something he wanted to mean
[1:08:12] something praise the lord
[1:08:17] praise be to god so we think about it
[1:08:21] unless god does it remember unless god's
[1:08:24] in
[1:08:24] it you're beating the air
[1:08:28] you're fighting you're running you're
[1:08:30] doing is absolutely
[1:08:32] futile unless it's god doing it
[1:08:40] amen this applies to the preacher more
[1:08:44] than anybody
[1:08:46] huh should we say not more than anybody
[1:08:49] i shouldn't say that because it applies
[1:08:50] to us all
[1:08:52] isn't that right but if i come up here
[1:08:54] and it isn't the lord's doing
[1:08:58] you're listening in vain
[1:09:01] it means nothing
[1:09:04] a gathering together you know and this
[1:09:07] is really a message
[1:09:08] where we're just here to glo glorify god
[1:09:13] we're the brag once again on god
[1:09:16] because he's the only one that's worth
[1:09:17] bragging about
[1:09:19] huh you're going to brag about muhammad
[1:09:22] ali
[1:09:23] but how did he spend his years i'm not
[1:09:25] sure if it was dementia or what it was
[1:09:28] horrible ending like amen
[1:09:31] and with what worshiping muslim or
[1:09:34] something a different religion left
[1:09:35] christianity
[1:09:36] what's his end like nothing to be proud
[1:09:39] of
[1:09:41] all comes to nod but we're serving one
[1:09:44] that never gets old
[1:09:46] never gets tired never sleeps he was
[1:09:50] here from the beginning he was here
[1:09:51] before the beginning
[1:09:52] he'll be here after the end we're like a
[1:09:55] drop in the bucket our lives are just
[1:09:57] like a little dot in time
[1:09:59] like a little shadow a little vapor that
[1:10:01] goes by
[1:10:02] your life doesn't mean much unless god
[1:10:05] is in it
[1:10:10] amen unless god
[1:10:14] is in it it is
[1:10:18] in vain unless god
[1:10:21] does it let's talk about god doing some
[1:10:24] things
[1:10:25] first of all how many knows that unless
[1:10:27] god saves you you're not going to get
[1:10:29] saved
[1:10:33] you might try to have faith isn't that
[1:10:36] right
[1:10:36] well i want to try to believe i'm going
[1:10:37] to try to believe brother bam says you
[1:10:39] know that
[1:10:40] if god don't honor if he don't recognize
[1:10:42] your faith you'll never receive the
[1:10:44] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:46] huh and in the otherwise he says if god
[1:10:50] does recognize your faith he will
[1:10:53] instantly baptize you with the baptism
[1:10:56] of the holy ghost
[1:10:57] how many believes that you receiving the
[1:11:01] holy ghost is your vindication that god
[1:11:03] accepted your
[1:11:04] faith but if god don't accept your faith
[1:11:08] and if he don't give you the holy ghost
[1:11:10] you are just as much as sinner as what
[1:11:12] you ever was
[1:11:16] huh you're just as lost as what you ever
[1:11:20] was
[1:11:22] people put on act like
[1:11:26] make like
[1:11:29] pretend but their true colors show
[1:11:32] sooner or later amen i was listening
[1:11:35] brother brown yesterday he was talking
[1:11:37] about what the evidence of the holy
[1:11:38] ghost is
[1:11:40] and i thought you know there is a bible
[1:11:43] evidence of the holy ghost and
[1:11:46] jesus said what it was jesus said what
[1:11:50] the evidence was
[1:11:52] amen of whether you're a good tree
[1:11:55] or whether you're a bad tree am i right
[1:11:59] what did he say by
[1:12:03] their fruits ye shall
[1:12:06] know them amen
[1:12:11] praise the lord amen and so you look at
[1:12:15] that you look at the fruit
[1:12:16] that you're bearing you look at what god
[1:12:19] does
[1:12:20] god has to do it now we know that the
[1:12:22] new birth the prophet taught us that the
[1:12:24] new birth is a revelation
[1:12:27] it's something that's revealed to you
[1:12:30] amen because it says uh you know even
[1:12:33] even to peter
[1:12:34] flesh and blood was it was not revealed
[1:12:35] to peter by flesh and blood
[1:12:37] but my father revealed it to him
[1:12:40] and he says you know unless a person has
[1:12:42] a back side of the desert experience
[1:12:46] this don't vote for just the preachers
[1:12:48] behind the brother bam says ain't no
[1:12:50] preacher got no right back here
[1:12:52] unless he has what met god
[1:12:57] without that it's all in vain am i right
[1:13:01] it's no good
[1:13:02] you have to meet god in other words god
[1:13:05] has to come down
[1:13:07] and meet you hey hey we all know that
[1:13:11] moses on the backside of the desert he
[1:13:12] could have went and looked at all kinds
[1:13:14] of bushes and everything else
[1:13:16] but that didn't ever done him any good
[1:13:19] it had to be god there
[1:13:20] in that version that made the difference
[1:13:26] amen
[1:13:30] oh my this is all about really this
[1:13:33] morning it's about being
[1:13:35] completely surrendered to god it's about
[1:13:39] really making room for god
[1:13:43] all right i was thinking about that
[1:13:47] how that jesus there was no room for him
[1:13:49] in the end
[1:13:50] huh there was no room for jesus
[1:13:54] in the end now how many knows have dated
[1:13:57] if the everybody in the end would have
[1:13:59] known
[1:14:00] isn't that right and first half
[1:14:04] some of them didn't know i don't know
[1:14:06] maybe
[1:14:07] joseph and mary come strolling up there
[1:14:10] with their donkey up there to the front
[1:14:11] door as we would
[1:14:12] imagine you know come up around the
[1:14:14] front door of the hotel to check
[1:14:16] in and perhaps a lot of people were
[1:14:19] saying oh they're looking there
[1:14:20] there's joseph and mary you know they're
[1:14:22] having a baby and they
[1:14:24] they got married you know so before they
[1:14:26] were getting
[1:14:27] before they got married you know she was
[1:14:29] oh my hey he looked down on her
[1:14:32] and so forth and and you know and and
[1:14:35] there
[1:14:35] they were perhaps at the front register
[1:14:39] amen and joseph asked hey i really need
[1:14:42] a room real bad
[1:14:45] you know and uh
[1:14:48] cashier says you know i'm sorry but
[1:14:50] we're full
[1:14:52] and other people heard you know that
[1:14:55] they were telling him
[1:14:56] that they was all full we ain't got no
[1:14:58] room for
[1:15:00] now if they didn't truly understand what
[1:15:04] that little baby was all about
[1:15:07] huh then they said look we'll take the
[1:15:10] barn
[1:15:11] we'll go out there and sleep in the barn
[1:15:13] with the animals you take my room
[1:15:16] but nobody was willing to give him a
[1:15:18] room
[1:15:20] huh so that's what this morning's about
[1:15:23] it's about
[1:15:24] making room for him amen
[1:15:28] i want to look at some things praise the
[1:15:31] lord
[1:15:32] jesus said made the statement he says
[1:15:34] you know
[1:15:35] abide in me and my words abide in you
[1:15:38] and you can ask what you will
[1:15:40] for without me you can do
[1:15:45] it's really all in vain if he ain't
[1:15:47] doing it
[1:15:48] if it ain't the holy ghost in you doing
[1:15:50] it
[1:15:52] you're doing it in vain
[1:15:55] amen i wrote down here in my notes if
[1:15:57] you're drawing a breath and it ain't by
[1:15:59] god
[1:16:00] you're wasting your breath
[1:16:03] if you're living your life and it isn't
[1:16:04] god living it
[1:16:06] you're living in lane
[1:16:10] praise the lord oh holy flower
[1:16:14] bruh stephen laster he called me
[1:16:17] yesterday
[1:16:18] and he run at prayer you know because
[1:16:20] they've had it rough
[1:16:21] you know from a blowed head gasket to
[1:16:23] sickness in the house and it's just
[1:16:24] ranging forwards
[1:16:26] but in the middle of all that brother
[1:16:28] stephen got to encourage me and he says
[1:16:29] you know brother he says you know
[1:16:32] you know he's not called to be a
[1:16:33] preacher but he likes to be an
[1:16:34] encouragement to preachers
[1:16:35] huh how many believes you you may not be
[1:16:38] part of the five-fold ministry
[1:16:39] but you can still edify the body of
[1:16:41] christ every one of us has something
[1:16:44] that we can let god
[1:16:46] do through us every one of us
[1:16:50] he was saying he made a statement and
[1:16:53] testifying to me he said motherboard you
[1:16:55] know i didn't know where he was going
[1:16:56] with this for sure
[1:16:58] he said you know god he predestinated
[1:17:02] us before the foundation of the world
[1:17:06] and you know he says you know he really
[1:17:08] wouldn't have done that
[1:17:10] if he'd known you wasn't going to make
[1:17:11] it
[1:17:13] huh how many believes now i thought that
[1:17:15] was such a word of wisdom
[1:17:17] you know in the middle of uh hard times
[1:17:19] here he is yielded to god enough to be
[1:17:21] actually be able to say something like
[1:17:23] that
[1:17:23] that would be encouraging that would be
[1:17:25] inspiring and it would be so true
[1:17:27] i thought that's the truth that ought to
[1:17:29] make us all get up out of our
[1:17:31] seats and shout and say god i believe
[1:17:34] that you did pronounce it
[1:17:35] i believe that you chose me and i know
[1:17:38] i'm gonna make it
[1:17:42] amen if you believe you're one of god's
[1:17:44] children
[1:17:45] you wrote before the foundation of the
[1:17:47] world and god has let you this far
[1:17:49] he isn't going to take you just so far
[1:17:51] and let you down
[1:17:53] if you fall down god will get you back
[1:17:55] up you may even try to run but god will
[1:17:57] catch
[1:17:58] you he knows you're gonna make it
[1:18:06] hey you think that's not wait till we
[1:18:07] get over there brother john wade
[1:18:09] we're gonna scream and holler i knew it
[1:18:12] i knew i was going to make it because i
[1:18:14] knew god took me through every trial
[1:18:18] took me through every test took me
[1:18:21] through the apps took me through the
[1:18:23] downs took me to the end took me
[1:18:25] out but he kept me and it was not
[1:18:28] me it was him
[1:18:33] that's why we're not going to have a
[1:18:34] problem with praising god
[1:18:38] worshiping god
[1:18:44] amen praise be to god
[1:18:48] let's look at the times you know some
[1:18:50] people
[1:18:51] in the world think that god is just
[1:18:54] quiet
[1:18:55] shh where's god at
[1:18:58] they don't know where god is
[1:19:02] and jesus said a little while the world
[1:19:05] won't see me no more
[1:19:06] i wonder where we're live
[1:19:10] aren't they all wondering where in the
[1:19:11] world he is
[1:19:13] yeah they put him out of their school
[1:19:15] put him out of donation put him out
[1:19:16] there all the saturday
[1:19:17] congress used to have an extra chair for
[1:19:19] him they took that away
[1:19:23] huh
[1:19:28] anyway but you know but he says they
[1:19:31] won't see me no more
[1:19:33] but you will see me
[1:19:37] how many do we have this morning that
[1:19:39] see him
[1:19:40] i see him in every trial i see him
[1:19:43] through every roadblock i see him
[1:19:46] through every wall that is in front of
[1:19:47] me i see him and he takes me
[1:19:50] through glory
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:58] hello y'all kind of quiet
[1:20:01] i'm wondering has god ever take you
[1:20:03] through a wall
[1:20:05] you couldn't get over it you couldn't
[1:20:06] get under it you couldn't get around it
[1:20:11] let me tell you something this very
[1:20:13] building is a absolute
[1:20:14] miracle this building wasn't supposed
[1:20:18] to be finished this building was never
[1:20:22] supposed to make it
[1:20:23] no never was supposed to make it and if
[1:20:26] it wasn't for god it would have never
[1:20:27] made it
[1:20:28] if god don't build the house you're
[1:20:31] doing it in vain
[1:20:33] it has to be god and if god before us
[1:20:39] who can be against you i want to say
[1:20:42] this this morning that every carnal
[1:20:44] every attempt everything that you try to
[1:20:46] accomplish through your flesh
[1:20:48] is all in vain
[1:20:54] amen completely fail not just once but
[1:20:57] every single time
[1:20:59] never will be blessed that's why it's so
[1:21:02] important
[1:21:03] that we make sure that it's god in your
[1:21:05] life
[1:21:06] god in my life working
[1:21:10] every day every moment every breath that
[1:21:13] we draw
[1:21:14] every service that we have make sure
[1:21:16] that it's god
[1:21:17] doing it amen
[1:21:22] so we think about it your very salvation
[1:21:24] your very new birth
[1:21:27] you don't get the holy ghost unless god
[1:21:29] gives it to you
[1:21:31] acts we call it the book of acts we have
[1:21:34] another book that they call the acts of
[1:21:36] the prophet
[1:21:37] is that right but how many know you can
[1:21:40] look
[1:21:40] and you can look and read every part and
[1:21:43] every page of the acts of the prophet
[1:21:46] huh and you really realize that it
[1:21:49] wasn't really the prophet it was god
[1:21:52] it was the acts of god through the
[1:21:54] prophet
[1:21:56] so people that want us think that god is
[1:21:58] a quiet god
[1:21:59] i have news for him he was very noisy
[1:22:03] in this time he was very loud
[1:22:06] in our generation he faced
[1:22:10] all the hindus the buddhist sikhs all of
[1:22:12] the religions of the world
[1:22:14] faced him right down and said let your
[1:22:16] god open this blind man's eyes and i'll
[1:22:18] become a buddha muhammad or whatever you
[1:22:21] are
[1:22:21] let him come and open this blind man's
[1:22:23] eyes that's what god said through the
[1:22:25] prophet
[1:22:26] he never said it unless god showed him
[1:22:28] in there right so what was it really it
[1:22:30] was god to the prophet
[1:22:33] that's what he did and people still
[1:22:34] think he's silent boy are you in for a
[1:22:37] rude awakening
[1:22:39] you couldn't be more wrong god is not a
[1:22:41] quiet god
[1:22:43] how many believe that god is not quiet
[1:22:45] in your life he's not quiet in my life
[1:22:48] before the service is over i want to
[1:22:50] talk to you about how to do you have
[1:22:52] to amen that guy comes down and he helps
[1:22:54] you to open up
[1:22:55] your heart he opens up the channel
[1:22:58] so that you can actually let him come in
[1:23:01] and work
[1:23:02] through you because he said the works
[1:23:05] that i do shall you do also
[1:23:07] remember there's everything that jesus
[1:23:09] did he says the works that i do
[1:23:12] shall you do also
[1:23:16] if we're not doing those works that he's
[1:23:18] that we would do that we are not
[1:23:19] surrendered to god the way we're
[1:23:21] supposed to be
[1:23:24] amen moses in his carnal self
[1:23:29] say yeah i'm a deliverer my mama said i
[1:23:31] was a deliverer
[1:23:33] mama said i was a beautiful child i have
[1:23:35] a very special
[1:23:36] place and god has called me to deliver
[1:23:38] god he's going to use me to deliver them
[1:23:40] and he began to see their own people all
[1:23:43] beat up and everything else and
[1:23:44] an egyptian smiting as a jew right
[1:23:48] and he went over there and killed that
[1:23:49] egyptian buried him in the sand to try
[1:23:51] to cover his tracks
[1:23:54] huh pharaoh finds out about this and he
[1:23:56] had to run for his life
[1:23:58] hello the best that he could do with his
[1:24:01] own carnal mind and his
[1:24:02] own ability was a dead egyptian
[1:24:06] and complete failure
[1:24:08] [Music]
[1:24:10] that's what any of one of us do if we
[1:24:12] try to do anything in ourself
[1:24:14] amen that's our biggest problem is
[1:24:16] ourself
[1:24:21] but after he met god on the back side of
[1:24:24] the desert
[1:24:26] 40 years later and then he had to get on
[1:24:28] a desert for 40 years and god had to get
[1:24:30] all of the old moses out of him
[1:24:34] huh you didn't do nothing look at you
[1:24:38] you're nothing but a sheepherder on the
[1:24:40] backside of the desert nobody knows you
[1:24:42] even exist you're not so popular anymore
[1:24:45] huh until one day
[1:24:50] god called i mean that makes all the
[1:24:53] difference in the world
[1:24:54] when god does something that's what we
[1:24:57] need
[1:24:58] more in our services we need god
[1:25:01] to do something we need him to come
[1:25:05] we need him to do it then something will
[1:25:08] happen
[1:25:09] it's not what we can manufacture it's
[1:25:11] not what we can conjure up no that's not
[1:25:13] it at all
[1:25:14] it's about what god does it's the only
[1:25:16] thing that's of any value
[1:25:20] we're laboring in vain we're meeting in
[1:25:23] vain unless it's god that's doing it
[1:25:27] amen after
[1:25:30] moses met him in the burning bush after
[1:25:33] god said come up here i want to have a
[1:25:35] talk with you
[1:25:36] and he come up there on the backside and
[1:25:38] that way up in the mountains and he seen
[1:25:40] his burning bush he met the pillar of
[1:25:43] fire
[1:25:44] how many knows nobody could ever come in
[1:25:46] the presence of jesus
[1:25:48] and be the same person again
[1:25:51] it'll change you forever it's the
[1:25:54] difference between a carnal believer
[1:25:56] and a spiritual believer it's a
[1:25:59] difference between you absolutely being
[1:26:02] on a rock that can never
[1:26:04] move you it'll hold you
[1:26:08] it holds you you don't hold it
[1:26:11] because if you're holding it huh
[1:26:15] well i better quit this and i better
[1:26:16] quit that i heard brother brown said how

[1:26:32] and i don't if you got that attitude you

[1:26:52] man won a child especially our young
[1:26:54] folks

[1:27:50] want the holy ghost
[1:27:52] i'm dead
[1:27:57] and i want him to live i want him
[1:28:01] to live in me
[1:28:04] i don't want him to be he's no more in
[1:28:06] the manger
[1:28:07] isn't that right he's in a different
[1:28:09] manger
[1:28:11] where is he now he's in the manger
[1:28:15] of your heart that's where almighty god
[1:28:19] is
[1:28:23] how many believes god is still working
[1:28:24] he's still doing things
[1:28:26] sure he is amen
[1:28:30] so god has to reveal it one place he
[1:28:33] says you know it's not by might nor by
[1:28:34] power
[1:28:36] but it's by my spirit saith the lord
[1:28:40] paul says you know they that are led by
[1:28:42] the spirit
[1:28:43] they are the children of god amen how
[1:28:46] many believes that you have to be
[1:28:49] led by the spirit
[1:28:53] not by your flesh it's so easy to let
[1:28:56] the flesh
[1:28:57] lead you sometimes but the holy spirit
[1:29:01] is the one that's supposed to lead you
[1:29:03] to guide you into everything it's not by
[1:29:05] your power
[1:29:06] not by your might but it's by his spirit
[1:29:08] saith the lord
[1:29:10] amen praise the lord
[1:29:13] everything you do and all that you
[1:29:17] do should be in the will of god even
[1:29:20] business people
[1:29:21] this just came to my mind when i was
[1:29:22] thinking about even the business people
[1:29:24] business people you know a lot of times
[1:29:26] we'll say well the bible says
[1:29:28] uh in timothy believes somewhere he
[1:29:30] talks about you know if you're going to
[1:29:31] say well i'm going to go into a certain
[1:29:33] city and sojourn and do business
[1:29:36] it says the bible says you ought to say
[1:29:38] if the lord's will
[1:29:40] isn't that right don't even conduct your
[1:29:43] business unless you say
[1:29:44] lord if it'd be your will
[1:29:48] because that's the way that jesus was i
[1:29:50] believe that this is amen getting the
[1:29:52] bride ready
[1:29:53] we're going to have to be more like
[1:29:54] jesus if we're going to meet him in this
[1:29:56] high
[1:29:57] are you with me we're going to have to
[1:29:59] think more like jesus we're going to
[1:30:01] have to act more like jesus
[1:30:03] we're going to have to have more of his
[1:30:04] works
[1:30:06] if we expect to leave this place and
[1:30:08] i'll believe we're past due
[1:30:11] it's passed through his coming
[1:30:16] amen sure it's way late
[1:30:19] how can we possibly go to 20 21.

[1:30:24] other day he says you know i predict and
[1:30:26] totally annihilation of the world by
[1:30:28] 1977. he he
[1:30:31] he covered it all not just the ushering
[1:30:34] and i'm living but it talked about the
[1:30:35] annihilation
[1:30:36] he says america will be burnt to a crisp
[1:30:38] it won't be no just some sticks sticking
[1:30:40] up
[1:30:41] hello he all predicted all of that but i
[1:30:43] have no i now that's prediction he said
[1:30:45] not prophecy
[1:30:46] but i said the woman think that's a
[1:30:48] prophecy huh

[1:30:59] appreciate him
[1:31:00] amen he talked about you know
[1:31:04] he says i believe the god has got to
[1:31:06] fight i hope you don't mind me telling
[1:31:07] me this i don't think he does
[1:31:09] the five-fold minister he says i believe
[1:31:11] that god has got the best for last
[1:31:14] i don't know about you but i sure don't
[1:31:15] feel that way but you know i had a good
[1:31:16] point
[1:31:18] i said not just the ministry i said but
[1:31:20] i believe every one of his children are
[1:31:22] the best
[1:31:23] i believe he saved the best for last
[1:31:27] amen you got to be the best not because
[1:31:30] i say or you say but if god picks you
[1:31:32] you got to be the best you are the best
[1:31:34] if god chose you
[1:31:36] and he's here and he has chosen you and
[1:31:38] me to finish this out
[1:31:41] how many wants to do a better job lord
[1:31:43] help me to do a better job finishing
[1:31:45] this thing out
[1:31:46] i want to go out and be just like the
[1:31:48] lord
[1:31:50] thank you lord jesus just help me amen
[1:31:54] to surrender more to him i don't want to
[1:31:58] beat the air
[1:31:58] if any anything we don't like beating
[1:32:01] the air
[1:32:02] we don't like spinning our tires we
[1:32:04] don't like
[1:32:05] failing we don't like doing things in
[1:32:08] vain
[1:32:09] and there'll be many of them on that day
[1:32:11] how many knows on that day
[1:32:12] there'll be many of them disappointed
[1:32:15] because they did all of those things and
[1:32:17] yet
[1:32:17] it was in vain because god was not in it
[1:32:22] i don't know if mike can look it up or
[1:32:23] not but there's a song that talks about
[1:32:26] god did we know that i think there's
[1:32:29] like a course
[1:32:30] or the course goes god who who opened up
[1:32:32] the red sea
[1:32:33] god did we know huh
[1:32:37] something about god did we know you mean
[1:32:39] i thought that's the truth no matter
[1:32:40] what happened
[1:32:41] whether it was the red sea whether it
[1:32:43] was deliverance it was god that did it
[1:32:47] amen let me just go to a scripture talks
[1:32:49] about the acts of god for a minute
[1:32:50] how many believes that it's the acts of
[1:32:52] god before i go back to the old
[1:32:53] testament touch that comes to my mind
[1:32:55] about the book of acts
[1:32:56] let's talk about the book of acts the
[1:32:58] book of acts brother bam said that there
[1:32:59] was a man came to him
[1:33:00] and he said you know the book of acts is
[1:33:03] just the scaffold work
[1:33:04] of the church huh
[1:33:08] now what if we had we did have set
[1:33:10] scaffold up here laying the brick
[1:33:12] we were scaffolding me brother john he's
[1:33:14] not here this morning but we was just
[1:33:15] laying there bringing them scout for
[1:33:17] work and
[1:33:17] and and you brought somebody up to look
[1:33:19] at the building how it's coming
[1:33:21] and that person said boy that
[1:33:22] scaffolding work right here that's a
[1:33:24] beautiful building
[1:33:26] rattle them a little huh
[1:33:29] i love these scaffolds that's a
[1:33:31] beautiful building here
[1:33:33] you'd say no not the scaffold the
[1:33:35] building
[1:33:37] but if you say no this is a building
[1:33:40] i said we need to ride back where we
[1:33:42] could pick you up at
[1:33:45] not too intelligent but they came to him
[1:33:48] with that it was just kind of a rough
[1:33:50] it was just a scaffold work of the
[1:33:51] church but the man says no
[1:33:54] no it was the church it was the building
[1:33:58] i mean the book of acts was the acts of
[1:34:01] the holy spirit in
[1:34:04] his church that's why we say that
[1:34:08] however they acted
[1:34:09] in the book of acts if you've got the
[1:34:11] holy ghost you're gonna act the same way
[1:34:16] anytime god raises a people up a church
[1:34:19] up it starts another
[1:34:22] book of acts so let me ask you this
[1:34:26] question this morning before you come to
[1:34:28] the altar
[1:34:29] are you fulfilling like they did in the
[1:34:30] book of acts
[1:34:33] huh are we there no we're not there
[1:34:38] amen don't you long to see a crippled
[1:34:41] man crippled and somebody lay their
[1:34:43] hands so rise up and walk i petered it

[1:34:50] just shake it off
[1:34:52] you didn't bread brahms time isn't that
[1:34:53] right that's right
[1:34:57] god's still the same god he still does
[1:35:00] the same things
[1:35:02] but this christmas we should ask
[1:35:04] ourselves are we fulfilling another book
[1:35:06] of acts
[1:35:08] is it god acting through us or do we
[1:35:11] still have too much of ourself

[1:35:25] this is what we're doing this morning
[1:35:28] talking and magnifying the lord for his
[1:35:31] mighty acts because that's really the
[1:35:34] only thing brad was bragging about is
[1:35:36] what god does
[1:35:44] my life the only thing worth bragging
[1:35:46] about the only thing good
[1:35:47] in my life is what god did there's none
[1:35:50] good it's only him that's good
[1:35:54] 145 says i will extol thee my god

[1:39:57] of the holy ghost that is what you're
[1:39:59] looking for

[1:40:07] you a peace
[1:40:08] that passes understanding to give you

[1:40:13] able to
[1:40:14] say brother bile i know what you're
[1:40:16] talking about when you talk about a
[1:40:17] peace that passes understanding
[1:40:20] because i have experienced it otherwise

[1:40:25] my experience doesn't do you any good

[1:40:58] your sins
[1:40:59] and he has given you peace in your heart
[1:41:02] that's what god does
[1:41:04] amen but their next they waited for that
[1:41:07] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:09] if he didn't come they were all just
[1:41:11] going to be sitting there
[1:41:12] they would have never been changed
[1:41:13] nothing would have ever happened but
[1:41:15] what happened is god

[1:41:59] world on fire
[1:42:01] god set the world on fire through who
[1:42:04] through these people
[1:42:06] and it was no longer the book of acts
[1:42:08] but it was the acts of the holy spirit

[1:42:14] book of the acts of god is what it was
[1:42:17] amen
[1:42:19] praise the lord how many is glad that we

[1:42:29] trouble god is very
[1:42:31] very real

[1:43:27] and inspired david how many knows we can
[1:43:31] do a lot of stuff but if it's in
[1:43:32] yourself it'll fail
[1:43:33] but if god will inspire you to do it oh
[1:43:36] my it'll be a complete success
[1:43:38] but it has to be the inspiration of god
[1:43:41] david said who is this uncircumcised
[1:43:43] philistine
[1:43:45] amen i can just hear the holy spirit
[1:43:47] speaking through david
[1:43:48] because somebody knows even samson he
[1:43:50] was he was powerless until
[1:43:52] and the spirit came upon him say uh sham
[1:43:56] god the spirit came
[1:43:57] upon him when god comes down it makes
[1:44:00] all the difference in the world that's
[1:44:03] why we want every day of our life that's
[1:44:05] what we want in our services for god
[1:44:08] to come down and we have to have open
[1:44:12] hearts for that
[1:44:13] let me talk to you about that for a
[1:44:15] little bit how many believes that's what
[1:44:17] it takes it takes an
[1:44:18] open heart
[1:44:21] it takes faith it takes a surrendered
[1:44:24] life
[1:44:25] surrender
[1:44:31] it takes a dying to ourselves
[1:44:36] to see god come and do the works that he
[1:44:38] did
[1:44:39] remember he said the works that i do
[1:44:40] show you also because i will not leave
[1:44:43] you comfortless i
[1:44:44] will come to you how many knows it's
[1:44:46] important that every one of us has a
[1:44:48] death to ourself you have to die to
[1:44:51] yourself for god to be able to do it
[1:44:53] anything
[1:44:56] all right i have i got one quote that i
[1:45:00] want to read this morning
[1:45:02] one quote oh my
[1:45:08] let me finish with god coming down would
[1:45:09] that be okay you know hurry right
[1:45:12] i know it was a long time wasn't it from
[1:45:15] last time it didn't save us a long time
[1:45:18] even though i was sick and on my bed
[1:45:20] amen
[1:45:22] streaming on my bed i said it's kind of
[1:45:25] nice but i feel backslidders all get out
[1:45:28] i would not want to do this huh i'm like
[1:45:32] i'm not with the
[1:45:32] saints i'm not cleaned up i'm not
[1:45:34] praising god i'm not you know i'm just
[1:45:36] sitting here
[1:45:37] not feeling good and all and that's
[1:45:38] where you should stay if you're sick
[1:45:39] like this with the pandemic
[1:45:41] we continue to ask people to stay away
[1:45:43] if you would amen
[1:45:46] it isn't that you don't have faith and i
[1:45:47] don't have faith but there may be others
[1:45:48] that don't have faith
[1:45:50] amen just a wise thing to do but i felt
[1:45:53] terrible it was just like
[1:45:54] oh man i would a whole lot be rather be
[1:45:57] in church yesterday in friday i was like
[1:45:59] man when sunday ever going to get here
[1:46:01] i'm ready to get back in the house of
[1:46:03] god
[1:46:04] how many knows it's we don't do this
[1:46:06] because you have to
[1:46:07] i don't have to do this i want to do
[1:46:10] this
[1:46:11] i love coming to church i love cleaning
[1:46:14] myself
[1:46:15] up and brushing my teeth hello amen and
[1:46:18] coming to church
[1:46:21] getting ready to worship the lord why
[1:46:22] because he's worth it
[1:46:26] oh my i was on the way to church and i
[1:46:30] thought
[1:46:30] think of the hope that we have think of
[1:46:33] this
[1:46:34] how did even though we have death to
[1:46:36] deal with yet perhaps in the body and so
[1:46:37] forth but yet we know what's over on the
[1:46:39] other side we know that
[1:46:41] god is eternal and if we're a part of
[1:46:43] god we're as eternal as he is
[1:46:45] we're going to be in the how happy we
[1:46:47] are to be
[1:46:49] and yet brother branham says you know if
[1:46:51] there was no hereafter
[1:46:53] if there was no heaven to go to i would
[1:46:56] want to do this
[1:46:57] right here all my life
[1:47:02] why because some people do it for reward
[1:47:03] other people didn't realize that this is
[1:47:05] the best thing on the planet
[1:47:07] this is the best way to live
[1:47:11] this is what gives you peace this is
[1:47:12] what gives you joy this is what gives
[1:47:14] you happiness
[1:47:14] why wouldn't you want that that's the
[1:47:16] main three main ingredients probably
[1:47:18] in our life is peace joy and happiness
[1:47:22] amen and you have that he said he
[1:47:26] wouldn't he wouldn't
[1:47:26] he wouldn't do this this here if there
[1:47:28] was no reward at all amen
[1:47:31] anyway praise the lord okay
[1:47:43] brother brad says i used to preach over
[1:47:45] in the baptist church a little sermon
[1:47:47] called and i called it
[1:47:49] let loose and let god maybe we could
[1:47:52] call it let go
[1:47:54] and let god now if brother branham was
[1:47:58] inspired by something i believe it's the
[1:47:59] right inspiration don't you
[1:48:01] so if he realized that people learn need
[1:48:03] to learn to
[1:48:05] let go and let god have his wonderful
[1:48:08] way
[1:48:16] now how many knows god just doesn't push
[1:48:17] himself on you
[1:48:19] he doesn't force you he's not that kind
[1:48:21] of a god
[1:48:23] you have to let him you have to open
[1:48:25] your heart
[1:48:27] all right
[1:48:31] that's right just let loose and let god
[1:48:36] as you get yourself into it
[1:48:40] and as as long as you get yourself
[1:48:43] into it then there's no way you know
[1:48:46] amen
[1:48:47] god can't do anything as long as you're
[1:48:49] in the way
[1:48:52] this is going to be my punchline this
[1:48:54] morning you know
[1:48:55] the biggest enemy i got is william
[1:48:59] branham
[1:49:01] oh that hairy little
[1:49:04] ugly squini-eyed demon
[1:49:10] that spooky looking devil that mean
[1:49:12] thing that causes
[1:49:14] doubt and all kinds of things about no
[1:49:15] he's not your biggest enemy
[1:49:18] huh the devil himself
[1:49:22] was rendered powerless at calvary
[1:49:26] huh you're worse than the hairy devil
[1:49:34] i don't know if some say he's hairy and
[1:49:36] i don't know
[1:49:38] my father-in-law he's touched one of
[1:49:40] them he says walking down the hall
[1:49:42] thought it was his daughter and he
[1:49:45] touched this hairy looking thing
[1:49:47] come to find out and it went into this
[1:49:49] room and he went over to his daughter
[1:49:50] and his daughter was laying over there
[1:49:52] ah chills all up and down you know what
[1:49:54] i'm saying
[1:49:56] but whether dear harry or not how many
[1:49:58] knows well let me just
[1:50:00] come somebody didn't brother bram talk
[1:50:01] about that bat looking with the long
[1:50:02] hair
[1:50:04] that's right so yeah big and hairy and
[1:50:06] uglier in the bat
[1:50:08] but yet you're worse than that i'm worse
[1:50:11] than that
[1:50:12] yourself brother brahm says is the
[1:50:14] biggest enemy
[1:50:16] that you have what is that that's that
[1:50:19] old self
[1:50:20] that's in there let me say what happens
[1:50:23] with this self
[1:50:24] all right biggest enemy of god's william
[1:50:27] brown he's
[1:50:28] always in god's
[1:50:31] way
[1:50:35] if i can just get him out of the way
[1:50:37] then god can go to work
[1:50:40] that's my message this morning let's get
[1:50:43] ourself
[1:50:43] out of the way everybody hear this on
[1:50:46] stream
[1:50:46] if you can get yourself out of the way
[1:50:49] god
[1:50:50] can complete his acts god can work
[1:50:56] just like he did in the book of acts how
[1:50:58] many is
[1:50:59] jesus still wants to save the lost he
[1:51:01] still wants to be the light in your
[1:51:03] community and in your neighborhood
[1:51:05] he wants to be a light to your workers
[1:51:07] or workers to the boss
[1:51:08] he wants to be the light everywhere you
[1:51:10] are he wants to heal the sick raise the
[1:51:13] dead he wants to do all of these things
[1:51:16] he wants to work miracles
[1:51:19] but if it's not happening then guess
[1:51:21] what
[1:51:22] you're in the way
[1:51:27] verbum says he's to god it gets in the
[1:51:30] way
[1:51:30] what is the gift brother branham a gift
[1:51:32] is to get yourself
[1:51:34] out of the way when i come up here so
[1:51:37] many times
[1:51:39] i'll rely on notes i'll rely on my my my
[1:51:42] my study this out of the other and if it
[1:51:44] gots in it it's okay
[1:51:46] but i can do that in myself and it
[1:51:47] really doesn't fly
[1:51:49] huh i have to learn to get myself out of
[1:51:52] the way
[1:51:53] so god can work how many believes is
[1:51:57] that's true for the preacher don't you
[1:51:58] think that's for every christian
[1:52:00] you have to learn to get yourself out of
[1:52:02] the way
[1:52:05] just sitting there right now this
[1:52:07] morning think about it i know we've been
[1:52:09] sitting here what
[1:52:10] i don't know how many minutes but we've
[1:52:12] been sitting here while
[1:52:14] right now it's about you about you
[1:52:16] getting yourself out of the way
[1:52:18] what might happen if you really get
[1:52:20] yourself out of the way
[1:52:28] so he says if i can just get him out
[1:52:29] then god can go to work
[1:52:32] that's your worst enemy
[1:52:35] is yourself
[1:52:39] that old man that was how many how
[1:52:42] why would god tell us to die to
[1:52:44] ourselves
[1:52:46] but if samson not just died but rot that
[1:52:49] guy's got to be gone
[1:52:52] when we bury somebody by the water there
[1:52:54] it is a representation
[1:52:56] that the old man is dead we're burying
[1:52:59] him now
[1:53:01] he's dead you don't think your own
[1:53:04] thoughts anymore you don't live your own
[1:53:05] life you don't have your own will you
[1:53:07] don't have any of that
[1:53:12] and just comes to mind
[1:53:16] one of the things that is in our life
[1:53:19] this everybody should listen to this
[1:53:23] one part of our life that perhaps
[1:53:29] stops god's in his tracks from working
[1:53:32] through us
[1:53:33] is you know what it is it's things that
[1:53:37] we know
[1:53:37] that we do that we shouldn't and yet we
[1:53:41] do them
[1:53:44] bible called it iniquity
[1:53:48] because remember this if you don't get
[1:53:50] rid of that if you don't get rid of that
[1:53:52] iniquity
[1:53:53] huh things that the holy spirit tells
[1:53:56] you you ought to do
[1:53:58] or tells you you should do and you still
[1:54:00] don't do it you're actually a worker of
[1:54:02] iniquity
[1:54:04] how many people on that day he's gonna
[1:54:06] say depart from me
[1:54:08] you that knew you should do better and
[1:54:10] you didn't
[1:54:11] you blocked me i couldn't work through
[1:54:13] you because
[1:54:14] you knew what you should do but yet you
[1:54:20] didn't
[1:54:22] workers of iniquity depart from me
[1:54:26] how many would say like david said lord
[1:54:27] take all iniquity out of my life
[1:54:30] help me from this sunday morning on
[1:54:33] anything i know that i shouldn't do
[1:54:35] god don't let me do it
[1:54:39] lord give me the strength not to do it
[1:54:41] otherwise i am a worker of iniquity and
[1:54:43] it stops god and
[1:54:44] he can't work through you how many knows
[1:54:47] that
[1:54:48] god doesn't work through iniquity he
[1:54:51] works through a pure heart
[1:54:52] that is 100 surrendered to him
[1:54:56] if it had to surrender himself samson
[1:54:59] surrendered his
[1:54:59] strength and look at what god did moses
[1:55:03] had to surrender himself
[1:55:05] his mind his soul his future his
[1:55:07] thoughts his ambition
[1:55:08] everything has to be surrendered to god
[1:55:10] young people if you're going to work for
[1:55:12] god and see what god worked through you
[1:55:14] it's all got to be surrendered lord i
[1:55:17] know what you want me to do i don't know
[1:55:18] where you want me to go i want you
[1:55:19] but here i am my mouth i don't want my
[1:55:22] mouth to open unless it's going to be
[1:55:24] you speaking lord
[1:55:26] i don't want my mind to be thinking
[1:55:28] unless it's god's thoughts i refuse to
[1:55:29] think any of the devil thoughts
[1:55:31] any doubt any of those things come in
[1:55:34] amen
[1:55:35] just cast them right out i only want
[1:55:37] god's thoughts and watch your life
[1:55:39] trends
[1:55:40] watch this church transform watch your
[1:55:42] family transform
[1:55:43] watch yourself young people watch
[1:55:45] yourself transform
[1:55:46] if you will completely surrender to god
[1:55:50] because that is in fact our biggest
[1:55:53] battle is that self
[1:55:57] i said you still want some of your way
[1:55:59] you still want to get in god's way you
[1:56:01] still have attendance in god's way
[1:56:03] because we know the devil is completely
[1:56:05] rendered powerless
[1:56:06] the power is there for you to do it it's
[1:56:08] just that you fight with your old self
[1:56:11] amen in whether or not you allow god god
[1:56:16] in your life and work the way that he
[1:56:18] wants to work
[1:56:22] amen i just want to close with this
[1:56:25] statement
[1:56:26] your worst enemy
[1:56:30] that's your worst enemy is yourself
[1:56:33] get yourself out of
[1:56:37] the way i feel that's the holy spirit
[1:56:42] get yourself out of the way
[1:56:46] and watch me work my miracles
[1:56:52] and then god can go to work
[1:56:56] how many believe that this morning if
[1:56:58] you'll get yourself
[1:56:59] out of the way every man woman and child
[1:57:02] that is under the all under the holy
[1:57:04] spirit if you get yourself out of the
[1:57:06] way well you feel like maybe you are
[1:57:08] listen i have been preaching for 30
[1:57:10] years and i know i still have room
[1:57:13] that i can make to get out of the way so
[1:57:15] god can do
[1:57:16] more greater things in my life
[1:57:20] amen praise the lord
[1:57:24] brother brahm says what is a gift this
[1:57:26] was in one of his prayer lines
[1:57:28] that i can move my own thinking i can
[1:57:30] move my own life from me
[1:57:32] my natural life my soul that's william
[1:57:34] braham if i can get him out of the way
[1:57:37] god will use that body to speak
[1:57:42] we all know brother bannon because soul
[1:57:44] yield himself to god
[1:57:46] that he would begin to see visions he
[1:57:48] would see what people's wrong with him
[1:57:50] and he would speak and he would have to
[1:57:52] go back and play the tape he don't know
[1:57:53] what he said
[1:57:55] huh how many believes the holy spirit is
[1:57:58] a little like that for us today
[1:58:00] the pentecostals used to be so able to
[1:58:03] get themselves out of the way
[1:58:05] that's why tongues were so easy to speak
[1:58:07] in tongues because they knew just how to
[1:58:09] yield themselves
[1:58:11] huh how many knows this morning for you
[1:58:13] to properly worship the lord
[1:58:15] to sing songs and hymns to him you have
[1:58:17] to get yourself out of the way
[1:58:20] amen maybe and on one big secret let me
[1:58:23] tell you
[1:58:24] something one big secret i like to do is
[1:58:26] to close my eyes and worship the lord

[1:58:29] amazing grace i'll sweep this out

[1:59:32] about living for other people not just
[1:59:33] yourself
