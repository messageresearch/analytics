========================================

the Lord. Thank you. [applause] Amen. Let's bow our heads once again. kind heavenly father, we bow our heads, Lord Jesus, to the dust from whence we came, Lord Jesus, our physical bodies, Lord, and we just look up to you, Lord Jesus, our heavenly father that's created our spirits, created our souls, Father, and has put in our hearts, Lord Jesus, a place, Father, for the abode of the Holy Spirit and put a thirst in there so that we would have a hunger and a thirsty after righteousness, Lord. And [snorts] we have come into your house this morning once again, Lord. Father, with our hands lifted high, Lord Jesus, our hearts, Father, under expectation, Lord Jesus, uh Lord, of what you would have for us this morning, Lord, and so that we could go better, go from here a better people than what we've come, Lord, and that you would change us from glory to glory. We thank you, Lord Jesus, for touching each and every one of the sick people, Lord, not feeling well, Lord, for the prayers that were made. We believe, God, that you'll answer each and every one of them, Lord, for you are that kind of a God. We ask God that you'll just bless the reading of the word, the meditation of our heart and our study. Father, we pray Lord God that it would be right in the center of your will, Lord. Help me to get out of the way that you might just speak now, Father, and the ears of the hear, Lord Jesus, if there's any impediment, Lord, something that would cause them not to be able to receive your word, Father. We take every spirit under our control for the glory of God. And we ask, God, that you'd have the liberty. in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn your Bibles if you will. We'll just get right into the word. Certainly is good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. I don't know what you do for having a good time. Amen. But I believe there's joy in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's joy in the house of the Lord. Amen. Amen. So if you want to go somewhere where there's joy, Amen. I believe you won't find any better place in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Kind of a thought that the Lord just laid on my heart. Amen. Can you bring that title up before we even read this morning? Amen. Amen. The conflict between God and Satan. Amen. Amen. That's the thought that came to my mind when I first begin to meditate on this. That's just a thought that came in my mind. And then um Amen. I remembered brother Brandham preaching something on that order and it was called the the conflict the contest message he preached was called the contest. Amen. A good message to listen to preached in Jeffersonville in ' 62. Amen. Amen. So he had some quotes there that I really liked. Amen. And so we're going to Amen. take a journey again. this morning. Amen. We'll go as far as we can, but we're going to start, Amen. in heaven and we're going to try to end up over on the other side of tribulation period. Amen. So, we got a long way to go, don't we? Amen. From Genesis to Revelations. Amen. Amen. I think maybe we'll start with uh perhaps Isaiah. Let's just go to the book of Isaiah 14. Isaiah 14. If you'll notice and think about it, realizing that a lot of times a conflict can be called a conflict. Amen. Or should we say that a war is that right? Might call it Amen. Russia and so forth. And they're having a conflict over there. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, a conflict or a battle or a war. Amen. So Isaiah 14 verse 12, how art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning? How art thou cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations? For thou has said in thine heart, I will ascend unto heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north, and I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Amen. Amen. Over in second Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, second chapter. We beseech you, brethren, by the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that day of Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means. For that day shall not come except there come a falling away first. And that man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposes and exaltth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God siteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God. Verse seven, when for the mystery of iniquity does already work, only he who now leth will let until he be taken out of the way. And then shall that wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming, even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivleness of unrighteousness in them in them that perish, because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Amen. The God of this evil age, and also lean not on to your own understanding. Brother Benham goes into great detail about this about they will not receive the vindicated word of the hour. They will not receive the truth. Amen. Then it says verse 11, for God shall send them strong delusion and that they should believe a lie that they might be damned who believe not the truth but have pleasure in unrighteousness. May God bless you. Bless the reading of the words. You can be seated. You can get comfortable. Sit down and relax. Chill. We're going going for a little while. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. That's right. We know that the world in which we are living in is described by Jesus when he said, "Behold, Amen. I sent you forth as sheep among wolves." How many believe we're living in a world of wolves? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I didn't bring it out here. Forgot it. But this morning I was looking at Fox News and they were uh I believe it's Nigeria and how that they said the front page was a was a large number. But when I looked at the details it talked about since 2009 how 50,000 Christians have been killed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Millions displaced and so forth. The number the first number was higher than that. I'm thinking it was 125,000 of of the persecution that's going on. Amen. How many days? There is truly a persecution. Amen. Coming on to the Christian. Amen. Especially out in that part of the world. So we live in quite a world. Amen. We live in Satan's Eve. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me just kind of lay a foundation. Amen. Brother Brandon when he was because it's the direction I want to go. Amen. Brother Brandon was pre preaching on the contest, he says it this way and he read the scripture about spiritual wickedness in high places. He says, "I'd like to draw a little 10-minute 15minute context." This was a 1962 midnight service right around 12:00 midnight when they were going, Amen. into 1963. Amen. So, he just wanted to speak for about 10 15 minutes. He says, "I want to call it the contest." The contest is a test of strength. Amen. Amen. Where we have a test strength. Amen. It used to be the Indian used to put a fire and they would put so many on this side of a rope and so many on that side they'd have a tug of war. The contest of strength would pull the losing party across that fire. Amen. We know there's many things. Amen. And we could base upon for a few minutes now the contest but I want to speak for a few minutes he says quickly upon the greatest contest there is between the church and Satan. The great strength of Satan. And we want to speak on the great strength of God in his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother B says, "Now this contest has been going on for many years. It started Amen. in Eden." &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; I was going to ask y'all. Amen. It didn't start in Eden, did it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Sin did not originate in Eden. Sin started &gt;&gt; in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hard to fathom, but it started in heaven. &gt;&gt; That's where the first Amen. contest, so to speak, or the first conflict, Amen, began was in heaven. I don't know about you, but Amen. We uh, you know, I'll just say this, it comes to mind. Amen. This is a cruel world we're living in with a lot of hardships, a lot of struggles. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we try to teach our children, I don't know if Paul, have you ever been told, but Paul, Daddy, you got to be tough. &gt;&gt; Is that what we teach our children, hey, you got to be tough. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody says something about it, something bad about you. I mean, you got to be strong. &gt;&gt; Lord, forgive them. If you're weak, get up there and punch them. But you got to be strong. say, "Well, God forgive him." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It takes a lot more strength to restrain than it does just to fly out. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we teach our children, you know, especially where me and Brother David and and where I come from. Hello. A lot of times, you know, you start on a crew and you start working somewhere and people are mean and pull this and pull that. They would just want to see how tough they are. &gt;&gt; You have to be tough to make. Why? because they know it's a it's a cruel world. Amen. And you can't be a &gt;&gt; Amen. We get won't get very far. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's right. So it's a test of strength. Amen. This it's listen. It started in heaven and Satan was kicked out into the earth and then become the enemy of God's people. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Since then, he used all his strength and and his strategy to pull GOD'S PEOPLE ACROSS THE fires into his fires. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, I like sometimes uh you know what does the Bible say? That he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we are able to ask or think. &gt;&gt; Amen. More than what you can even think. I like to imagine sometimes. Maybe, brother Troy, maybe someday we'll get up there and we'll ask for a rewind. Lord, can you show us a rewind of what happened up here? We'd like to see this conflict. We'd like TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE devil all OF A SUDDEN DECIDED THAT HE WANTED TO BE A GOD. He wanted to be above the stars of God. the battle that WENT ON WITH MICHAEL AND HIS ANGEL and Lucifer. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And there was a war that went on up in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let me ask you this. Let me just read this quote before I before I say it, but I like this here. He says, "And we know and we know right after into his fires, he says, "And we know who has the most power." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Who has the most power? God does. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. That he has the most power. &gt;&gt; He's more POWERFUL THAN THE DEVIL. HE THE DEVIL is not a creator. God is a creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. You hear preachers say, "Stupid devil." &gt;&gt; Well, when you really think about it, he ain't too smart. &gt;&gt; Now, don't get me wrong, he outsmarts millions and billions of people. &gt;&gt; He does. And can we truly say that your wits don't match his? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, your wits don't. BUT GUESS WHAT? God's good. That's it. &gt;&gt; God's good. That's why say you don't stand a chance against the devil if you ain't GOT THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. That's right. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, IF YOU AIN'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST, HE'S ALREADY GOT YOU. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So that's WHY YOU GOT TO HAVE THE WISDOM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE LED BY THE HOLY GHOST, YOU CAN BE LIKE A David and say, "Who do you think you are? I don't care how BIG YOU ARE. I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF A BIG old tree you look like you are. I KNOW MY GOD AND YOU AIN'T NOTHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The reason I brought up stupidity and I didn't have this in my notes, but I begin TO THINK ABOUT WHY THE DEVIL IS SO THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT HE is no match for God. &gt;&gt; That's right. He knows that he he all the devil CAN DO IS PERVERT, BUT GOD CAN CREATE. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, this morning, we're going to we're going to talk this morning about how how uh successful and how marvelously successful the devil is. We always say the devil's a loser. Yeah, he is a loser, but he's also marvelously successful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The devil has not won many wars. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. No, I'm going to rephrase that. The devil has won many battles. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Many battles. The first battle, the first conflict was in heaven. He lost. &gt;&gt; HE GOT THROWN OUT. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? The second battle, WE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS CAST down into the earth. And then he began to talk to Eve. Isn't that right? Began to preach to Eve and started to work on Eve and it worked. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. GOT EVE TO FALL. GOT UP AND out of the fall. GOT HIM TO STEP OUT FOR HIS LIFE, plunged the whole creation into death. Can you imagine the joy bells and the dancing and the her and the har that was going on in the regions amongst the devils? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; MANY MANY BATTLES THE DEVIL HAD WON. &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear a preacher say that too much. Going &gt;&gt; be a little bit different this morning. God admit it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Amen. One, but you know, now let me let me stop there. Come back and realize that some people says, "Well, I don't know about the Bible and I don't know about God and and so forth." But we know that butterham said in the greatest battle ever fought and first of all let me let me say this that in the contest says we need to learn the devil's tactics when you're fighting somebody and when you're coming up again in a contest when you're in a contest with somebody especially boxing which is what brother Brandon knew he would mention how you know maybe he'll have a good left hook or something or a right jab or whatever it is and you'll learn just what that opponent will do so that you can block that when he comes. And he says, "That's what we need to do. That's what we've got to do is learn the devil's tactics, &gt;&gt; learn his jabs, learn how he works, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; Amen. And I thought, well, you know, that that that that's telling me what I need to do, but that's not really telling me all that much because I need to wonder what these tactics are. What are his jars? Not just, you know, because we got to get into detail about it. You know the good part about it is I don't have to come up with it. I mean God already told us &gt;&gt; THROUGH THE PROPHET OF GOD when he preached the greatest battle ever fought. &gt;&gt; He told us there OF HOW THAT WE ARE our own greatest enemy. Isn't that right? How that the devil will use you. You have your feelings, your emotions, your oh my all kinds of those things that that's where THE DEVIL COMES IN. HE'LL COME IN a bruise. He'll come in a in a fight in a in a battle or in an argument. to come in a hurt somewhere and all of these different things, 10 senses and all THAT THAT YOU GOT TO KEEP GUARDED cuz if you don't your reasoning your imaginations because that's what you use on evil was our reasoning. Now is it reasonable? &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Rab called lean not to your own understanding. Said the you know the that the the churches of this age has taken the lead to their own understanding their own ideas &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; above the vindicated word of God and put the devil where he's always wanted to be. &gt;&gt; So let me establish this. He says you've heard of wars and rumors of wars and if your stands we'll have plenty more wars. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I believe we're going to have more wars. Yep. &gt;&gt; You're going to have another battle with the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're not done yet until we're done. &gt;&gt; UNTIL WE'RE OUT OF HERE. You'll have battles. &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE THERE'S ONLY TWO powers in the universe? No. You can't EXCLUDE YOURSELF. YOU CAN'T GO OFF AND JUST DISMISS YOURSELF FROM THE WHOLE THING. You're one or the other. of all of our differences in the nations, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EACH OTHER AND EVERYTHING. It all amounts to two powers. Two powers is there's only two powers in two kingdoms. Amen. &gt;&gt; All the rest of just minor things that connected with either one either one of those powers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; How many BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU is connected to one or the other? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are a part of one or you are a part OF THE OTHER. YOU ARE EITHER POWERED BY the devil this morning or you're powered by God this morning. Period. &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO NEUTRAL GROUND. IF YOU THINK YOU'RE ON NEUTRAL GROUND, YOU'RE ALREADY ON THE DEVIL'S SIDE CUZ GOD don't have you on no neutral ground. &gt;&gt; You got to stand on one side AND THE OTHER. SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL MAN UP AND STAND UP AND FIGHT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. B DECIDE WHOSE POWER, WHO IS GOING TO CONTROL YOU BECAUSE THAT'S THE GREAT CONFLICT IS NOT IN HEAVEN ANYMORE. AMEN. It's not in Eden anymore. AMEN. IT'S IN HUMANITY NOW. THAT'S WHERE THE BATTLE COMES. JUST LIKE NORTH KOREA, JUST LIKE VIETNAM, WE WERE FIGHTING COMMUNISM. FIGHTING COMMUNISM. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? I THINK IN THE KOREAN WAR AND NORTH KOREAN WAR, I'm not sure WHAT THE NUMBERS WERE. I THINK AROUND 67,000 OF OUR SOLDIERS gave their lives and lost. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Huh. Had to get out of there. It's either Vietnam or Korea. One of those. Amen. Sad, ain't it, to think, oh my thought, IT'S TERRIBLE. IT'S TERRIBLE TO LOSE WAR BECAUSE EVERYBODY THAT FOUGHT AND DIED AND FOUGHT FOR NOTHING. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Died simply for trying. That's why you want to die and fight for a good cause. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But anyway, SO THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. THEY USE THEY USE THESE CONVENTIONS. They use those people. THEY WOULD ARM THE VIETNAMESE. THEY WOULD ARM NORTH KOREA. THEY WOULD OR SOUTH KOREA. THEY WOULD ARM THEM. THEY WOULD EVEN ACTUALLY GO IN THERE AND MAYBE PUT AMERICAN soldiers in there. BUT IF THEY WOULDN'T have to, they wouldn't. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But let me TELL YOU SOMETHING. GOD AND THE DEVIL ARE AT CONFLICT with one another today. Amen. &gt;&gt; This morning &gt;&gt; right here in this church &gt;&gt; that's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Nobody else maybe can hear, but we do get it on where people listening. You're in a battle, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're on one side or you're on the other. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's only two. &gt;&gt; That's right. every disorder, everything that comes along, it's either controlled by God's power or Satan's power because that's the only two powers there is. And if that gets the power of life and the power of death, there's only two. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Satan's power, his power is got, he's a perverted power of God. It isn't no real power. IT'S A PERVERSION OF GOD'S POWER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord. Amen. How many believes that listening? We're sitting today here and one or the other power is going to control us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, LET'S CAST THE EVIL ONE OUT. HOW MANY THINGS THAT YOU and I have made to cast out? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; WE ARE HERE THIS MORNING. AH, Y'ALL WANT TO JUST READ IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER. AMEN. That God has sent out the greater power. I want to be able to witness in my heart. Yeah. That's right. I don't know what you're talking about, but there are thousand. The devil's power AIN'T GOT NO POWER IN ME ANYMORE. WHY? Because the power of the Holy Ghost is up in the earth. &gt;&gt; The devil wants to pull you over on the fire of depression. Amen. And a big old long face and sadness, DEPRESSION, FEAR, AND ANXIETY. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW, WE'VE GOT A BIGGER HOME. WE'VE GOT A BIGGER ROCK AND WE GOT A BIGGER POWER to be a jerk TEAM OUT THERE. YOU GET CONFESSED, DEVIL, BECAUSE you're not, you have sin. And if you have guilt, you're the ONE UNDER CONDEMNATION. DON'T PULL me over on your condemnation. &gt;&gt; Don't pull me over in the sin and depression. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we come to church for. &gt;&gt; We come to church to get victory. &gt;&gt; We don't come HERE TO WARM UP. FOOD TO GET up once in a while and then I'll go over you and say, "God, I WANT MORE OF YOUR POWER." &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. &gt;&gt; I'm not just here to be a wall. &gt;&gt; I'm here to send the DEVIL WHERE HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE. UNDER my feet. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's under my feet. He's under my feet. Satan is under my feet. The blue is under my feet. Lor is under my feet. under my layer. I make a [applause] new I'm [screaming] &gt;&gt; hot. &gt;&gt; I'm hot. That's right. &gt;&gt; Be hot for God. All right, I'm going to jump. &gt;&gt; Remember I told you that the devil is successful? &gt;&gt; The devil is successful. 100% successful. &gt;&gt; Amen. in his ambition. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In his DESIRE OF WHAT HE WANTED. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He has succeeded. &gt;&gt; That's why I wanted this kind of online. &gt;&gt; I'll be glad people need to hear this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan's now he said THAT HE WOULD EXALT HIMSELF ABOVE THE MOST high that he would ex ascend above the clouds and THE STARS THAT HE would sit there LIKE GOD AND BE ABOVE THE MOST HIGH. He has succeeded around say he has succeeded in carrying out his strengths. HE HAS CERTAINLY HAD A marvelous [screaming] success. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Don't do that much. &gt;&gt; Right. HE'S HAD A MARVELOUS SUCCESS, brother Ram SAYS, IN CARRYING [screaming] OUT HIS threats by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's promised word to that age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, he says, "Satan has succeeded in perverting and taking over this world and making it his kingdom that men was put on here by free agency, the Jews." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you notice the people, they exalt him above all that's called God. Didn't Thessalonians say that they would? the authority of a denominational church to people believing that denomination more than they believe God &gt;&gt; and GOD IS HIS WORD. THEY'LL BELIEVE THEIR DENOMINATION or creed above the word which exalts him above all that's called God. And there's only one God and that's the word. &gt;&gt; Woo. SO HE AS GOD SITS IN THE CHURCH OF GOD proving that he is God because he's got the people worshiping him. See God is the WORD AND HE EXALTS HIMSELF ABOVE ALL THAT'S CALLED GOD. AMEN. See the God of this age has exalted himself above the true vindicated word of God. Above all is CALLED GOD SO THAT HE HAS SITS IN THE TEMPLE OF GOD. AMEN. TEMPLE OF GOD WITH AUTHORITY. milk and he's praised for it. Oh, let the people of people God see that reception. He is praised for it AND SOLEMNLY BELIEVED BY THE PEOPLE OF THIS EVIL AGE. NOW, do you see the God of this and his servants of this evil age? Oh my. Listen, now let's watch it be manifested. He says he's making a better world for them to live in by his knowledge apart from the never failing word of God. But by his coming together in denominational and creeds and intellectual and science and so forth, he says he says he's making a better world for men to live in and ignoring the promise of God, then the only time the world will be fit in to live in is in the millennium. It's my opinion. He's making the world better world to sin in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice what he did. illegalized sin, whiskey drinking, cigarette smoke them. Church has legalized women can be a member of their church with short hair. Oh, may I stop here a minute? She can wear shorts and wear paints and still long as fruit, WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD. HE SAYS IT'S ALL RIGHT TO KNOW. What's that got to do with the just the same as the FORBIDDEN FRUIT IN THE BIBLE? She believes him. She loves him for it. Oh, I like this church. They let me do this and they don't let me do that. A preacher, he never preaches on Amen. Women wearing pants, wearing make preacher never preaches on those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Come on, people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, they like it. They like being able to go to church in their pants and their shorts and their everything else. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe it's Satan's eating? &gt;&gt; He's eating it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you ready for something real good? AND THEN A LOT of times the devil the devil beats us. He loves us. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been defeated out of &gt;&gt; heaven? Let me shake your hand and get heaven. &gt;&gt; He tries to beat you every day. &gt;&gt; Try to knock you out here. Knock you down there. HE'LL KNOCK [screaming] YOU DOWN. YOU GET DEFEATED ONCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I can do a flip right now. Amen. &gt;&gt; He might WIN THE BATTLE. SOMETIMES he wins many battles. &gt;&gt; BUT I'M HERE to tell you, he won't win the war. Where the war I lose, but I'll get back up and I'm going to fight you. And I know how this war ends. &gt;&gt; And it ends UP WITH ME HAVING THE VICTORY. You having the victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I love about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure, he wins battles. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You'd be stupid, ignorant, not to say this to say, you know, he does. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But this war ain't over. &gt;&gt; This battle is over. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He whooped Samson. They wrapped your eye on the Philistines and they whooped him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Booked him. That's why he was there IN THE GRINDING MILL. HIS EYES GOUCHED out going around to the ground day after day after day. That's right. &gt;&gt; God helping somebody this morning is enough for y'all. Man, the devil got me down. I'm in this blues, &gt;&gt; man. It just don't mean this. MY SISTER ME. I'M in this little warm condition. I've gotten cold on God. IT'S BECOME COMMON TO ME. NO, I'm just miserable. I want you to know, Amen. You don't always have TO BE MISERABLE. YOU GOT TO go to your home. Amen. [applause] You pray. But I guarantee you, while you're feeling terrible, [clears throat] while you're feeling down, amen, the devil, Amen, they're having their champagne. All the kings and all the great people of the Philistines were having a toast. They were having a party. Look how we loved him. Look how we look. I can just about imaging. But I'm telling you, I feel something here. I want you all to know you want [applause] to come down and [applause] thank you Jesus. Lord, &gt;&gt; this war ain't over. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, whatever condition you're in, &gt;&gt; you [sighs] tell him, "This war ain't over." &gt;&gt; I might be a captive. I might be changed. &gt;&gt; But I know a chain breaker. &gt;&gt; I know. I know he know I'm a son of God. [applause and cheering] Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; God is good, isn't he? [panting] &gt;&gt; Amen. I haven't got it wrote down. [panting] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here we are in the garden. The devil got late. God's first son, his first daughter, God of the fall. Listen to his reasonings. &gt;&gt; Here comes God down through there. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. What have you done? What have you done? He &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on out for me in the bushes. &gt;&gt; I know you're scared. &gt;&gt; I know you have fear. &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the devil tries to do to get you to have fear. &gt;&gt; Boy, if we can conquer fear, &gt;&gt; we can conquer anything. &gt;&gt; Come on out. I'm going have a talk with you. Because you've done this, you curse the ground and sweat, you're going to work, woman. Because you've done this in childbearing, you have labor, have pain, &gt;&gt; bring forth children into the world. Circle, &gt;&gt; I got something to say to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. So, you won this one. You won this round. But I want to tell you something. The Lord said to the serpent, "Because thou has done this, thou art cursed above all cattle and above all beasts of the field." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And upon thy belly shall thy go, and dust shall thy eat all the days of thy life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here comes a promise. I want a rematch. &gt;&gt; I'm calling for a rematch. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; forgive me if I'm wrong. This is the way I see it. Want to rematch. I'm going to put immity immity between the woman thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. It shall bruise the head and thou shalt bruise his heel. WHAT WAS HE TALKING ABOUT? HE WAS TALKING ABOUT CHRIST COMING. MAN, [laughter] I'll meet you there. I'll meet you at everything I need. He br HIS HEAD. NOW HE stop on his head. Over 64,000 years they were under the blood of the devil. his pawn shop. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. But not anymore. After Calvary, &gt;&gt; we were set free to change. We're broke. &gt;&gt; It was loose. &gt;&gt; REDEMPTION. The story of coming back. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Story of redemption for humanity. &gt;&gt; I believe we're in the final battle. Brother says, greatest battle ever fought is going into a raid. God is ready. HIS SOLDIERS READY. &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD that he gave us every message that he g us. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's the armor. It's the shield. IT'S A SWORD in there. Perfect. &gt;&gt; Put on the whole armor of God. WE GOT THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. We got a nuke. We don't have to just boot the devil. Come on. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. Here we go. Boo devil. Boo devil. Boo devil. &gt;&gt; Let it get smaller and smaller and smaller. You know what I like to do? I like the wood. But what I like to do better is brother Bam says that we have got an atomic bomb. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We don't have just some little 22 rifle. We ain't just got no machines on &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Like the North Korean leader. What's his name? Anyway, he said, "I've got I've got a butt. I've got a nuke button." Trump, I got a nuke butt. You remember that? What did Trump say? He says, "Yeah, he might have one, but I got a bigger one. &gt;&gt; Works out. He got a box, but I work [applause] him. I want to see the hide in the I want TO SEE THE FELATE." AMEN. &gt;&gt; I see LUKEWARMNESS DISINTEGRATE. I see depression disintegrate. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; From &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are we doing? I don't know about you, but I'm enjoying my God-given privileges. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Having the devil under my feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Having Satan under my feet. Having fear under my feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Having worried. &gt;&gt; Good worry. Brother, I like that. I wrote that down. &gt;&gt; You that want to be successful, he wants you to be successful. &gt;&gt; Yes. God wants you to be successful. &gt;&gt; Ain't that what he told uh David, not David, but Joshua, &gt;&gt; meditate day and night, then thou shalt have good success. &gt;&gt; Even better said, God doesn't want his children going around dark, hot, down hardened. &gt;&gt; He don't want you ALL SAD. GOD LOVES TO HAVE YOU HAPPY. &gt;&gt; Don't you love it &gt;&gt; when your children are happy? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my skip around and happy and all might just happen. That's how you want your children. &gt;&gt; That's how God wants you. &gt;&gt; And we're living a time that we live up to our God-given privileges &gt;&gt; of having Satan under our feet. &gt;&gt; God is more powerful than the devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. I love Samson's comeback. Don't you? &gt;&gt; That's right. He was there for a while. He was defeated, but this war was not over. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Jehoshaphat when the enemies wrote him a letter. Don't you trust your God? All these other nations trusted in their God and I defeated them. Best for you to surrender. Amen. Now Joseph I believe wasn't dressed in Santa Claus and ashes and call upon God. God said don't you worry. Amen. These enemies that you got tomorrow is going to be gone. And overnight I believe that one ANGEL KILLED 70,000 MEN OR SO. &gt;&gt; One angel goes through the temp. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; These two powers this contest has raged on for a very long time already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me give you a few stories this morning. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; all the way back in uh if you want to go Exodus, if you want to pull it up, you can. Exodus 14. I don't know if I gave you this one or not. Maybe Exodus 14, remember when Pharaoh and the Egyptians, man, were marching, coming after Israel after they were stuck in the Red Sea. They got down there to a dead end, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Daryl, after all, I just want to say this. Whatever you do, make sure you're not on the wrong side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make sure you're not on the wrong side. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're in the on the wrong side, &gt;&gt; you're in for real disappointment, &gt;&gt; defeat. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many know that Judas went over to the wrong side? &gt;&gt; He was on the right SIDE FOR A WHILE, BUT THE DEVIL GOT INTO IT. The devil had been put into the heart of Judas, his right. He went over to the enemy's side. WHAT DID HE END UP DOING? AMEN. WANTED TO MAKE SOME MONEY. And he ended up being so miserable he went and hung himself. &gt;&gt; Bows gushed out. Hung himself. He was so miserable. He ended up in defeat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Moses, if you'll notice in chapter 14, and we'll begin with verse 12. Well, let's go 11. And they said unto Moses, "Because there was no graves in Egypt, has thou taken us and died in the wilderness? Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth from Egypt? Is it is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, "Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians, for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness." Amen. What a what a terrible thing for them to say. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And Moses said unto the people, "Fear not. Fear you not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many pleasure when you're a child of [screaming] God, &gt;&gt; you got to get the fear out. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Get the fear out. &gt;&gt; Amen. And stand still. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And see the salvation of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Which he will show you today. For the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, you shall see them again no more forever. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. [clears throat] WHY? BECAUSE THE LORD, VERSE 14, THE LORD SHALL FIGHT for you &gt;&gt; and [applause] you shall hold your hand. So just sit back and watching. That's what we got to do. And every aspect of our lives, it's not your fight. It's [screaming] [cheering] not a devil. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. The only way we God has never lost, but man loses when they get away from God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Eve lost once you got away from the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You get out from away from God and you're going to lose. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You're going to lose. You fight God and his people. &gt;&gt; You better be very &gt;&gt; worried. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, think about he said, "Stand still and see the salvation." You know what brother preach? Stand still. We get so anxious about things. Troubles comes our way, we get so anxious, we get upset. We get disturbed. &gt;&gt; But you got to just hold still. &gt;&gt; The battle belongs to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Your battles belong to the Lord, people. Another one in Deuteronomy. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 1. We'll start with 27 [sighs] when he came up to Kish Barnea after all that God had done for him. Ain't that right? Verse 27. and you murmured in your tents and said, "Because the Lord hated us, he hath brought us forth from the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us. Whether shall we go up? Our brethren have discouraged our heart." Remember, they came back with evil report. &gt;&gt; Amen. The people is greater and taller than we. The cities are great and walled up to heaven. And all that we have seen there, the sons of Ana there. Amen. But like cancer, cancer likes to scare the liver out of us &gt;&gt; or these other diseases. Don't let it scare you. It might look bigger. Oh, I'm going to die. Don't you be believe. Amen. That that devil is bigger than God. I don't care how big he is. &gt;&gt; The sons of Anoch are there. Then said I unto you, dread not neither be afraid of them. THE LORD YOUR GOD FORTH before you. He shall fight for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. or according to all he did for you in Egypt before your eyes. He's the one that turned the water into blood. He's the one that brought fleas and made the Egyptians miserable. He's the one that did it. I want you to know, aren't you thankful? When you come through a trial, when you come to the tribulation, God has brought you through just commit yourself to God. Whatever you're going through, God going to take you through. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Why? because he fights your battles for you. &gt;&gt; OH, THOMAS B IS A WITNESS THAT GOD fights my battles for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He fights you. He takes you to &gt;&gt; get your grubby hands out of it. &gt;&gt; Can't stand Christians that's going to try to make the church this, try to do this and that and the other move things around. Why don't you follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost? Get your grubby hands out of it. &gt;&gt; Quit making the mess out of things. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get your hands off of your own life. Why? Because your life is not your own anymore. The life that we now live, we lived by the faith of the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like that he goes before you. Amen. Like he did do, he'll do again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, here we go. Another good one. I'm just going to mention this one. Well, maybe not. There was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. And the Lord said unto Satan, "Where comest thou?" And Satan answered the Lord, "From going to and fro ON THE EARTH, AND FROM WALKING up and down in it." &gt;&gt; Satan's like a roaring lion walking about. What? seeking whom he may devour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what he does. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; I like it. Here the devil is in the congregation sitting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Maybe he's sitting right there watching Danny. Brother Danny Julie. Maybe he turns back and looks at Brian. Sister Mildred looks at you looking at everybody. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wonder who I can devour. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Uh oh. &gt;&gt; Wonder what who's having a problem. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; who's having the issue? &gt;&gt; Who's having the feelings? This, that, or the other. &gt;&gt; Right. And &gt;&gt; all of a sudden, the Lord says, "Hey, devil. Hey, devil. How you doing, buddy? &gt;&gt; We've had a conflict for a very long time now, haven't we? We've been at each other for a long time. What you been doing?" Oh, I've been going to and for the earth. Amen. He said, "Well, how about that?" Walking up and down and Lord said to Satan, "Has that considered my servant Joe? &gt;&gt; Look at him OVER THERE. LOOK AT HIM BACK THERE. LOOK AT MY SERVANT." HUH? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I believe that the devil's looking at you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Devil's looking at you. &gt;&gt; Sure is. I WONDER IF GOD could say that about us. &gt;&gt; Have you considered my servant Tommy? Have you considered my servant Urban, my daughter Martha? Paul, Daniel, have you considered Troy? Oh, he considered Troy. &gt;&gt; Oh, he sure did. &gt;&gt; God says go out. Devil went at him. Devil went out at most of us. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know. There's &gt;&gt; Caleb, Lisa, Deon, since all you young Christians, be ready. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're still young Christians. God may put you through something. I hope you don't. But every Sunday comes to God. You come to the place to where you want to give up &gt;&gt; or you don't know which way you go. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right, &gt;&gt; folks. It'll bring you get to the place sometimes where you get TO THE PLACE YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. You just stand still. &gt;&gt; Just stand still. JUST BE STILL. WATCH. &gt;&gt; MAY NOT happen overnight. The overnight healing and deliverance is easy. &gt;&gt; Brother Troy went for A LONG TIME AND IT'S BAD. &gt;&gt; I went 10 years. &gt;&gt; Many years. &gt;&gt; Yeah. my battle. Boy, you don't want to hear it again, but I'mma say it. I had that song. How long? How long? How long? How long till the end of this valley? That was my favorite song. It encourages me to keep pressing down this alley. I was reading yesterday. I was studying this and the and the Israelites, you know, they were camped up on the on the mountain. Amen. and they'd come down and uh and fight the Philistines in the valley. So that is the the Philistines withdrew and they went back and said, "Let them come down to THE VALLEY BECAUSE THEIR GOD IS THE GOD OF THE MOUNTAIN, not of the valley." And so God said to the prophet, I BELIEVE IT WAS SAID, "NOW NOW YOU GO AHEAD AND GO DOWN IN THE VALLEY BECAUSE BECAUSE WHAT? BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT I'M the God of the mountain, not of the valley." [screaming] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; He's got everywhere. &gt;&gt; He got it. No matter what your situation is, &gt;&gt; I like to stay cold, but that excites me. &gt;&gt; To think that no matter what your situation is, &gt;&gt; he's the God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; That takes us through. All right. &gt;&gt; We ought to be the most excited people on the face of the earth. We [cheering] ought to be the happiest people on the face of earth. That is &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in me &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is one place that God challenged the devil. Is that right? Oh my. Boy, Job went through it. &gt;&gt; But God gave him a revelation that though the skin worms destroy my flesh, &gt;&gt; yet in my flesh I shall see my God. &gt;&gt; My redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; And I know in the last days I shall see him. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know. He said, let preach your message on I know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many knows? &gt;&gt; I know that I know that I know. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost. I know. So, now I hope so. &gt;&gt; Maybe so. So, so no, I know so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God [screaming] knew before he ever made that challenge to the devil. Wouldn't it have been sad? It'd be kind of a sad story if Job would have been defeated. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the end of this story? Job finally says after his wife says, "Why don't you just curse God and die?" Because the devil said, "Man, I'll make him curse you to your face." You know, you know, you take everything from him that you bless him with, take the hedge away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let anything go wrong that can't go wrong for a longer period of time. &gt;&gt; I know. and he'll curse you to your face. It was so miserable and so terrible until his wife said, "Why don't you just go ahead and curse God and die?" &gt;&gt; I guarantee you the devil was standing right there by his wife. &gt;&gt; You're standing right there. What's he going to say? &gt;&gt; What's he going to say? &gt;&gt; Why don't you curse God and die? &gt;&gt; He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Say it. Say it. I'm a woke God. I'm a woke him. That's right. I told him that I may cuss him to the face. Say to the Lord, "Come on. Come on. Pull him over with that depression. &gt;&gt; You're so miserable. Just come on and say it. Come over to my side. &gt;&gt; Just do what I want you to do." &gt;&gt; But Job says you like a fool as you &gt;&gt; woman. Oh baby say baby he was nice honey you speak like a woman huh said woman you speak well he didn't say woman first the scriptures he said thou speakst like you know brother said that he didn't call her a foolish woman &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; he didn't call her a foolish woman now you sisters would have probably took it that way call me a foolish said that uh you No, he didn't. He says, "You've talked like one." &gt;&gt; Like, &gt;&gt; he said, "Speak like one." &gt;&gt; Amen. When he said, "Thou speakest." I can see the pull. I can see the road coming. Don't you? AMEN. THE DEVIL DRAGON. OH, MAN. PRESS. &gt;&gt; That's good. That's where we want the devil to drive and defeat it. [applause] We want it. We want it. We don't want it happening. We don't want it dancing. We don't want you camped. &gt;&gt; We want the pillars to come down and crush your belts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To torment you, take your eyes out, try to take your joy away from you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you go out those buildings, when you go to work, the devil will go to work and try to get you a frown on your face &gt;&gt; to depress you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To bring fear upon you. Oh, am I going to make the rapture? Am I really forgiven for this or for that or the other? Hello. Is my sins really erased? Is my past gone? You trying to do everything he can, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Get in behind me, devil. You belong back there and down here. Now, let's look at a case where and how many knows it didn't end so well for Lindell. Nope. He was defeated. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. This little conflict ended up with God. Now, let's talk about the devil challenging God. How about the devil challenging God? in the story. One of my favorite stories, baby. Let me see here. I think it's way back here. Chapter 17, first Samuel. It says, "And the Philistines said, I defy the armies of Israel this day. Give me a man that we may fight together. When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistines, they were dismayed and greatly afraid. I believe brother Ron Spencer many times takes his Philistines, this big old giant as being like a cancer trying to intimidate you. You ain't going to get healed of this. This is too big for you. &gt;&gt; Huh? Well, of course it is for you, but with God, it's just Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saul and Israel heard these words of the Philist. They were dismayed and greatly afraid. Now, how many know that? That's one thing THAT GOD TOLD JOSHUA NOT TO BE. DON'T BE DISMAYED. Don't fear. I will be with you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Oh, if you're surrendered to God the way you should be, you put him first day and night and you put him first in everything, you don't have to be afraid. &gt;&gt; If you get away from God and if you don't stay in line with God, you have reason to believe that you can perhap easily be defeated. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to tack him up. &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Not that he won't let you He will He'll bring you around again if you're his child again. I'm not talking about being lost, but you talk about letting the devil come loose on you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You backslide. Brother says, "You'll pay." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Turn the devil loose on make you make you so miserable, you'll come running back. Say, "God, what's the problem with me? &gt;&gt; Lord, forgive me." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; How many would say, "Lord, do it. DO IT TO ME. IF I get back to you, if I get away FROM ME, YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. You bring me back." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You hear Aaron? Aaron back there raising. Amen. That's right. Why? Cuz that's what he did for a bit. &gt;&gt; We're thankful to have him back in church, aren't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] Amen. We love y'all's family. Remember that. Don't let the devil tell you any different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Okay. So let's look at this challenge. 95. Oh boy. Shouldn't have said it. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't have done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then a lot happened. Of course, David was sent down there and he went to Saul and you know, and he told him the story of his keeping his father's sheep and all that. He tried all the armor on. Amen. Many good lessons there. But he tried all the armor on. Saul scientific knowledge and understanding and so forth. No. But he says, "Let me go with what I have proved." &gt;&gt; LET ME GO WITH WHAT I KNOW WORKS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I like that. Don't you? I like to use what works. Let me read here. And the Philistines said to David, "Come to me. I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beast of the field. So we have a conversation now between Goliath and God's man David. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Philine says, "I'm feeding your flesh to the beasts of the field." David said, "Oh, really?" Remember, he was this crowny little guy. Maybe he had a speaking voice. I don't know. said, "Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield, and with a baby sounding voice, scared the liver out of anybody." Well, I'm not much to look at. I'm little puny. All right, I'm ready, brother. Call him a shrimp. Little [clears throat] shrimp of a f. Yeah. Come with me at me with a sword and a shield. But I come to you in the [screaming] Lord of all. [applause] &gt;&gt; It's not me THAT this morning. It's not you. [applause] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel. &gt;&gt; Yes. whom thou has defiled. This day will the Lord listen. This day will the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like that. David put the Lord first. &gt;&gt; TODAY [screaming] I'M GOING TO USE MY skills and I'm going to bring you down &gt;&gt; so that I can be a hero. &gt;&gt; No, no, &gt;&gt; no. He said, "This day the Lord will deliver thee into my hand." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I will smite thee &gt;&gt; and take thy head from thee, and I'll give the carcasses of the hosts of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air. In other words, they're going to come on down to all of you guys that are killed. And the crows are going to have themselves a nice eyeball supper. &gt;&gt; They going to feast on them eyeballs. [screaming] They taste so good. That's right. Listen to the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the field &gt;&gt; and all that on the earth may know that there is a God in heaven. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't you like that? AND SO THERE'S GOD IN THE MIDST of &gt;&gt; Oh, I like what I heard brother man say the other day and then the church that leads to the signs and the wonders and God performing miracles and all the new things that HE'S DOING. HE SAYS THAT BEYOND THE CHURCH YOU WANT to [applause and cheering] use that we want to church around for church and miracles pass &gt;&gt; God only did it through brother Brandon &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; he don't do it anymore &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus &gt;&gt; aren't you glad you belong to the church of God &gt;&gt; not this church, &gt;&gt; but to the church of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've been born again by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; This church of God is a universal church. This is just a part of that body. &gt;&gt; It's a universal body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope I don't forget my ending. All right. That's right. that there is a God in Israel. And all this assembly also shall know that the Lord saveth not by your wisdom and by your smarts and by your intellectual &gt;&gt; and by you making it happen. No, that's not how God does things. HE DON'T SAY WITH THE SWORD AND THE SPEAR, FOR THE battle is the Lord's. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] The battle is the Lord's. The battle is the Lord's. The battle belongs to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Stand back. Stand still and watch God work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's watch God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You just be so surrendered to God &gt;&gt; that you can have 100% confidence &gt;&gt; that you ain't got to worry about it. &gt;&gt; God do that. Whatsoever we ask in his name, he will &gt;&gt; do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the battle belongs to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we all ready? Let me just read the rest of it. We got to read the story, can't we? &gt;&gt; And he will give you into our hands, he told him. Let this assembly know. So apparently he was still talking to the Philistines. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he will give you because he's talking here to this guy. Amen. I'll feed you to the thous of the air. Let all this assembly know. Let all the let the enemy know that God doesn't save by, you know, by sword and shield. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How many know is that Israel and the Egyptians poor poor Pharaoh? All in his army drowned in the sea. &gt;&gt; They thought their spears and their chariots and all. No, God just had him come on in. Come on in. Maybe Moses was saying, "Come, come, come on. You think you can do what we do with the God that we serve?" &gt;&gt; No. [clears throat] the seven sons of SA remember they thought they could he cast out devils &gt;&gt; you know because the believer Paul could no no &gt;&gt; don't try to follow Amen and it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet David hast ran towards the army to meet the Philistine David put his hand in his bed and took fence stone and slang it and smoked the Philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth so David prevailed over the Philist things with a sling and a stone. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to put in there, but God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God. And smoke the Philistine and slew him. But there was not a sword in the hand of David. Think about this. And David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and threw it out of its sheath. The giant didn't have chance to draw. You talk about quick draw, &gt;&gt; right? David was quicker. Maybe he's coming at him. Philistine looking at him. David trying. Maybe he was grabbing for his sword. Didn't even get it draw. Didn't even get his tongue right. How many know that's God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] I like that. Amen. Praise the Lord. I like this. And David ran and stood upon him and so forth. And he cut off his head therewith. When the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I trust that there's all any spirit that is not of God will flee. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you've been defeated. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Not like this. And the men of Israel that were scared, remember it says they were scared. &gt;&gt; That's right. and hindered God. The men of Israel arose and shouted. &gt;&gt; How many know? And then after our enemy is defeated, after we see him defeated, we get the &gt;&gt; shout. [applause] [screaming] It's over with. I'm now filled with the bapt. Amen. I STRUGGLE WITH MYSELF AND I'm filled with God's spirit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That battle it out. &gt;&gt; And I've overcome like Abraham did when he met me Belchesc and he served in fellowship communion. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. info. Yeah. Brother man said that the devil has been had had a marvelous success in achieving his goal. He's worshiped by millions and billions of people. I think one of the turning points was when brother Brad preached on lean not to your own understanding the god of this evil age and he had said that because they lean to their own understanding and they've taken the word of a denomination over the word of god anything that's anti is against Christ. &gt;&gt; It's antichrist. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they had turned him away. Brother Bam says here he says and today the church world has turned Christ out &gt;&gt; in these last days. &gt;&gt; How many at one time brother Ben would say go into him. Go to church. Find your church. &gt;&gt; How many knows later in his ministry says come out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can't be part of a demand- made denomination be brought to Christ. Come out of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That the enemies come out of it. Why? Because of this right here. &gt;&gt; Because he as if they have turned him out &gt;&gt; just exactly like the book of Revelation says that they would do. &gt;&gt; Amen. The other day up on the mountain I was standing. I said, "Lord, I got one open door in the whole nation." &gt;&gt; I got one open door in the whole nation. Remember this is Jesus working through brother Ben. &gt;&gt; Jesus had one open door in the whole nation. And as far as I know, that's Phoenix, Arizona. It's the only one that I got. And I started down off the mountain and just as plain as I ever heard anybody speak said, "What's that today? Follow thou me." &gt;&gt; Follow me. God wasn't surprised. He knew that the Leysia would put him out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they took they went into death. Ain't that right? The church world went into death. They chose a Barabus &gt;&gt; instead of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice the biblical scriptures tied themselves together in every age. Notice when the church world would not have the word of God to rule over them, they accepted a murder rabbis. What does this do? Notice he's talking about the present evil age that we're living. What does this do? It exalted Satan, the god of this evil age, to the place that he's always wanted to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, Satan not spoke of being a god of any other age, but he is exalted to the place that he wants to be. How many know this is going to be his world for a little bit longer? He's going to push you and I out. Amen. That's right. Squeeze coming down. Amen. Shutting church doors and whatever. &gt;&gt; He's having his fall, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; A better world to sin in perversion and everything else. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; But how many knows tonight that yes, HE CAN SAY I HAVE SUCCEEDED. I have won. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. THE DEVIL CAN SAY, EVEN THE PROPHET SAID IT WAS A MARVELOUS SUCCESS. A marvelous success in DECEIVING THE WHOLE WORLD. [screaming] The Bible SAYS HE TOOK OVER THE WHOLE WORLD. But boy, if we was on the internet, we would say, "But it's not over. &gt;&gt; You have won the war." And not the not the one, BUT THE BATTLE. YOU MAY [screaming] HAVE GOTTEN WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. But you need to read a little further &gt;&gt; cuz I read of the stone that was cut out of THE Jesus Christ. He's going to come and he's going to crush devour every nation and he's going to come and he's going to take over. &gt;&gt; You and I are going to be with him. &gt;&gt; So let it be known devil. You think you succeeded. Yeah, maybe you have. But it's going to be a shortlived success. shall success &gt;&gt; cuz the Bible says that the meek &gt;&gt; shall inherit yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to be defeated. The scripture says that we're going to take you to the side of the pit. We're going to kick you off into the pit. &gt;&gt; We're going to chain you up for a thousand years. We're going to have a thousand year millennium. Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you a whole thousand years with Christ. WE OUGHT TO BE EXCITED about that. &gt;&gt; How many's looking forward? Oh, I'm watching and I'm waiting for the video when the Lord should come and take it. WAITING RIGHT AWAY. &gt;&gt; OH, HE'S COMING BACK TO earth again. Yes, our Lord is coming back to earth again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. God bless you this morning. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I just want to say thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you &gt;&gt; for your goodness Lord to me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lord help me to surrender myself to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When I get to places I can't get over, I can't get around, I'm really struggling with. Just get to your knees and commit it to God and say, "God, take me through this." And I guarantee you he'll come on the scene. Amen. And he'll open up red seeds for you. &gt;&gt; He'll quench the violence of fire for you. He'll stop the mouths of lions for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, can I go just for another thought? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just a little bit. We only have one, so &gt;&gt; we uh make it worthwhile. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you when we did have two. Nothing wrong with two, but sometime I would rather go a little long and just get a little bit more. You know, cuz otherwise we got to get started again. &gt;&gt; If we get him started, Pence's not stopped right away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, what could I say more? For the time would fail me of Gideon and Aar and Samson and Jeffy, David also, Samuel and the prophets. Paul was talking about it, right? &gt;&gt; He was talking about the the faith chapter. These great warriors of faith. who believed in God and God worked through. How many believe these are names that are immortal than in the Bible? &gt;&gt; Amen. Who through faith subdued kingdoms? Moses. Ain't that right? More powerful than Pharaoh, wrought righteousness, OBTAINED PROMISES, STOPPED THE MOUTHS OF LIONS, QUENCHED THE BOTTLES OF FIRE, ESCAPED THE EDGE OF THE SWORD. OUT OF WEAKNESS WERE MADE STRONG. WAXED VALIANT AND FIGHT. TURN TO FLIGHT THE ARMIES of the aliens. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought, you know, one of these days when we get over there, NO DOUBT THEY'LL SAY, "WHAT CAN I SAY MORE? WHAT CAN I SAY MORE? LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT HERMAN AND MARTH AND TOMMY AND TAMMY." AMEN. JOHN AND DEBBIE WAYNE. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT JOE AND HANNAH AND THE battles they fought. Look at the warriors they are. Look at brother Brian Janette. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were quiet. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe your names are going to be in heaven? &gt;&gt; People all of you in the middle of ALL OF YOU AND MAY your names be written IN HEAVEN AS MIGHTY conquerors who overcome Satan by faith in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because theirs is written. We all have a testimony, don't we? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Of coming up against the adversary. Amen. We have had faced our Goliath. We've had to conquer many things. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The contest goes on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad to be on the winning side? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nice to be on the winning side. &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. We lose a battle or two. We do that sometimes. It happens. Nobody's perfect. But we get back up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz guess what? When this war is over, guess where the devil's going to be? &gt;&gt; Nonexistent. &gt;&gt; How many believe non-existent? &gt;&gt; How many believe ALL THOSE THAT SERVE THE DEVIL WILL one day become &gt;&gt; nonist? &gt;&gt; That's right. Non-existent.
