[33:11] all for music
[33:33] well i'll pray before i begin
[33:35] father god i pray that you'll help each
[33:38] and every one of us to get close
[33:41] to you lord god
[33:43] each and every one of us have came here
[33:45] so that we may hear a message from you
[33:47] lord i pray that that you'll speak
[33:49] through me lord and lord speak to your
[33:51] people and speak to me lord and i pray
[33:53] that that you help each and every one of
[33:55] us lord and just to get in a closer walk
[33:58] with you lord and lord i pray that no
[34:01] one leaves here without being changed or
[34:03] without
[34:05] being um better than it was yesterday
[34:08] lord i pray that you'll help
[34:10] each and every one of us lord
[34:12] and i pray that and your word and and
[34:15] nothing but uh your word that aired in
[34:17] the truth is preached lord i pray this
[34:19] your precious name lord jesus christ
[34:20] amen
[34:26] all right
[34:28] and that endure temptation for when he
[34:31] is tried he shall receive the crown of
[34:34] life which the lord hath promised to
[34:36] them that love him
[34:39] let no man say
[34:41] when he is tempted i am tempted of god
[34:44] for god cannot
[34:46] be tempted with evil neither tempteth he
[34:49] any men but every man is tempted when he
[34:52] is drawn away of his own lust enticed
[34:56] then and when lusts hath conceived it
[34:59] bringeth forth sin and
[35:01] sin when it is finished bringeth forth
[35:03] death do not air my beloved brethren
[35:08] um may god that is um
[35:11] a sin syrian word you can be seated
[35:24] there are times when we
[35:26] keep falling down a lot of times it's
[35:29] over and over again and sometimes we
[35:32] feel defeated and feel like giving up
[35:34] if if you can and just
[35:37] keep getting back up again and never
[35:39] quit you have a
[35:41] winning spirit and you and you're
[35:42] destined to overcome because winning
[35:44] isn't always about defeating the enemy
[35:46] it's about how many times you can and
[35:49] fall down and keep getting right back up
[35:51] again and keep fighting and never give
[35:52] up
[35:54] now um
[35:56] now i was i was thinking
[35:58] like um
[36:00] about uh
[36:02] depression and
[36:04] and its
[36:06] effects
[36:07] on us like sometimes even as a christian
[36:10] we go through
[36:11] um depression sometimes
[36:14] and um i've i've been there
[36:17] like more
[36:19] so many times and it's it's not just a
[36:23] um
[36:24] it's not just a
[36:26] um
[36:27] sadness that goes away it's it's a
[36:30] mental illness
[36:32] and
[36:32] um this isn't what um my entire message
[36:35] is going to be about but but i j it just
[36:37] came to my mind
[36:39] since
[36:42] brother
[36:43] aaron's testimony because
[36:46] because it is a real thing and we can't
[36:48] just look down on it like it's it's
[36:51] something that you just it's just a
[36:53] small sadness thing that goes away in a
[36:55] few days it's something that that that
[36:58] can really negatively affect you and and
[37:01] sometimes make you suicidal i looked up
[37:04] on
[37:05] um
[37:06] i looked up online what was the
[37:08] definition of depression
[37:10] it's it's a common and serious medical
[37:14] illness that negatively affects how you
[37:17] feel
[37:18] though the way you think
[37:20] think and how you act
[37:22] fortunately it is also treatable
[37:25] depression causes feelings of sadness
[37:28] and or a loss of interest in activities
[37:30] you once enjoyed
[37:32] now um i've been depressed many times
[37:35] and the longest time i've been depressed
[37:36] was when my girlfriend broke up with me
[37:38] i know what that's like if anyone's um
[37:42] being through depression it's it's a
[37:44] hard time and what what i did was i i
[37:48] began to to try to
[37:51] try to look for help somewhere
[37:54] um without going to any anyone for help
[37:58] and i i went to music
[38:00] now
[38:02] the thing is sure music can can help you
[38:06] through depression but it's the right
[38:07] kind of music i got into
[38:09] rap music and that was
[38:12] and and i'm not just
[38:15] i i actually uh brother bailey probably
[38:17] remembers this i asked i asked him is
[38:19] christian music okay he said
[38:22] um that
[38:24] he said that and you should be careful
[38:25] with that and he said something like
[38:28] um
[38:29] that you shouldn't really listen into
[38:31] that it's it's it's probably a you
[38:33] should stay away from it
[38:35] and
[38:36] well
[38:37] i of course i didn't listen to him but
[38:40] because i was so addicted to it
[38:43] i i listened to this this rapper um
[38:47] nf he's supposed to be a christian
[38:49] rapper he he uh sometimes adds a few
[38:52] christian words in it
[38:54] and and i need to address this because
[38:57] there's some people here that might be
[38:59] listening to
[39:00] um christian rap music
[39:03] stay away from it now now i was i kept
[39:06] arguing with my parents um
[39:09] is it okay like um
[39:11] you know i kept saying you know it's
[39:13] okay because it's christian it's
[39:14] glorifying god and stuff in a worldly
[39:17] manner though see it's
[39:19] well you can't find in the bible
[39:21] but
[39:22] like that plainly saying rap music
[39:26] is is wrong but it's there you just have
[39:29] to be able to see it
[39:30] because yes it's worldly
[39:33] now i'm not i'm not just going to speak
[39:35] about rap music i think i'm
[39:37] but it's it's like sad music and there
[39:39] was a spirit on it i somehow realized
[39:42] that
[39:43] a spirit had got on me and it was it's a
[39:46] wrap spirit and and i was always wearing
[39:49] a hoodie all the time and
[39:52] and uh
[39:55] always always
[39:56] um okay in that that kind of
[39:59] mood and i would um
[40:02] and i i began to to start
[40:04] creating my own music and it was the
[40:06] first thing kind of music and i always
[40:08] try to try to to think i i was
[40:11] glorifying god and stuff with it now i
[40:13] didn't i didn't uh expect to go in this
[40:15] direction with like music and stuff but
[40:19] but it was
[40:20] i got in a bad place because
[40:23] i let that music
[40:25] i listened to it almost every single day
[40:28] at work and listened to an nf and it
[40:30] made me it made it worse and i got a
[40:33] more a more depressed state than i was
[40:35] before thinking it was helping me but it
[40:37] wasn't
[40:40] now um
[40:42] now where was i going with this um
[40:50] my
[40:51] girlfriend broke up with me that that
[40:53] was the saddest day of my life i was i
[40:54] was
[40:55] uh crying it like it and it was it was
[40:59] raining outside it's a good time to be
[41:00] rainy
[41:03] and and i was just crying in the rain
[41:05] and stuff and i was wondering why she
[41:07] she told me well
[41:09] um
[41:10] she she told me she thought and she felt
[41:12] that god was telling her to
[41:15] break up with me and and i i didn't buy
[41:17] it of course because there's a lot of
[41:19] girls that say
[41:20] they think is god that's telling them as
[41:23] an excuse i thought it was just an
[41:24] excuse that she made up but hurt so bad
[41:26] and and i was depressed for months
[41:29] a very long long time and i got
[41:32] down to really a really bad place
[41:35] and i didn't understand it but it
[41:38] but um
[41:39] but now i realize that that god knows
[41:41] best in in his plan
[41:44] and has
[41:45] something much greater in store for me
[41:47] and someone else he wants me to be with
[41:51] because
[41:52] because sometimes we don't understand
[41:54] this when we go through depression and
[41:55] bad things are happening
[41:58] and and when people actually
[42:01] exit your life that that you think will
[42:04] ink uh you wonder why and sometimes it
[42:06] can and really hurt
[42:08] and
[42:08] [Music]
[42:14] you didn't see and he he uh no he knows
[42:17] what's going to happen in the future and
[42:20] it's going to end up worse than than the
[42:22] way that we wanted it to be
[42:25] and
[42:26] [Music]
[42:28] and um
[42:30] and so um
[42:33] the depression is is this kind of
[42:36] um
[42:37] prison and that that sometimes we get we
[42:40] can get trapped in it's a mental prison
[42:42] that's it that's in our mind and and we
[42:44] need we need to to be able to overcome
[42:47] it and and for me i struggled how did
[42:50] how was i going to overcome this
[42:52] trapped in this place listening to the
[42:55] sad music that just kept me in that
[42:56] place and that that's what kept me in
[42:58] that place is because i
[43:00] because i um
[43:04] because i listen to that music i only
[43:06] put myself in a worse place than i was
[43:09] to begin with and
[43:11] and um
[43:13] and it was hard i i really
[43:16] really struggled
[43:18] with the depression and and i'm i'm only
[43:21] um
[43:23] going on on about this because i know
[43:25] there's other people that that struggle
[43:27] with this and and if i can
[43:30] and help people i mean i can't
[43:33] i can't um
[43:37] i can't and tell you how to to overcome
[43:41] depression because i didn't know how i i
[43:43] in fact i don't i don't even know how
[43:46] exactly i got out of it except except i
[43:50] quit listening to that um
[43:53] music
[43:54] and when i did that
[43:56] the things started getting better and i
[43:59] i quit
[44:00] uh with my um
[44:03] i don't know i don't know how as soon as
[44:06] i as soon as i started and gained my
[44:08] focus on on on god that's when when um
[44:13] when and i started getting out of that
[44:16] darkness
[44:17] and and that depression and because
[44:20] i mean it took a long time but
[44:23] if you keep focusing on on this the sad
[44:26] things and stuff
[44:29] then then you're going to stay down
[44:51] okay um i got a story i i'll go back on
[44:55] my
[44:56] first topic um
[44:59] this is a story of two frogs one one
[45:02] frog was fat and the other skinny they
[45:05] had advertently jump into that milk they
[45:08] couldn't get out
[45:09] as the as the sides were too slippery
[45:12] so so they were just swimming around the
[45:15] fat frog said to the skinny frog brother
[45:18] fog there's there's no use pedaling any
[45:20] longer we're just going to drown
[45:23] so we might as well give up the skinny
[45:25] frog replied hold on brother keep
[45:28] paddlings somebody will get us out and
[45:30] they continued paddling for hours
[45:33] after a while the fat frog said brother
[45:36] frog there's no use
[45:38] i'm becoming very tired now i'm i'm just
[45:41] going to stop paddling and drown
[45:44] it's sunday and nobody's working we're
[45:46] doomed
[45:47] there's no possible way out of here
[45:50] but the skinny fox said keep trying keep
[45:52] paddling some something will happen keep
[45:54] paddling
[45:56] and another couple of hours passed the
[45:58] fat frog said i can't go on any longer
[46:01] there's no sense in doing it because
[46:03] we're going to drown anyway what's the
[46:06] use
[46:07] and the fat frog stopped and he gave up
[46:10] and he drowned in the milk but the
[46:12] skinny frog kept on paddling
[46:16] ten minutes later the the skinny frog
[46:18] felt something solid beneath his feet he
[46:21] had turned the milk into butter hopped
[46:23] out of the vat
[46:28] just just hold on just like just like
[46:30] that that that frog that skinny frog he
[46:33] just kept on paddling he didn't know if
[46:35] he was going to get out of there he just
[46:36] kept on going he kept on going within
[46:39] with with his
[46:40] energy he he knew there was some way
[46:42] he's gonna get out of this it's it's
[46:46] seeming like all hope is lost but but
[46:48] there's a light at the end of the tunnel
[46:51] he got out of that that place he got out
[46:54] of that that mess that he
[46:57] thought he would was in they they done
[47:00] messed up by jumping that uh
[47:02] that
[47:03] bucket of milk to begin with but but
[47:06] they only
[47:07] failed to escape because
[47:10] that one gave up that's the only reason
[47:13] he failed and you can't we as believers
[47:15] we cannot fail
[47:18] unless we give up
[47:19] and and that's it that's the only way we
[47:22] can
[47:23] and fail giving up is is the definition
[47:27] of failure because um no one's ever
[47:31] failed without giving up
[47:34] well i guess i guess you could say
[47:36] people's failed without giving up
[47:38] but
[47:40] but you've only really failed
[47:43] when you give up if there's a possible
[47:44] way
[47:48] now um
[47:50] so so just just hold on just hold on on
[47:54] my brother just hold on my sister we've
[47:56] got a long way to go we may have climbed
[47:58] one mountain
[47:59] but we have countless mountains ahead of
[48:01] us just keep going it may be hard but
[48:04] we'll get through this just keep
[48:05] fighting the good fight we're on the
[48:08] hardest path we could be on but it's
[48:10] worth it
[48:11] and easy path leads to destruction so we
[48:14] are blessed people to to be on such a
[48:17] path with hills and valleys highs and
[48:21] lows sometimes sadness and despair but
[48:24] we'll make it through to the other side
[48:26] if we keep fighting
[48:33] now now sometimes
[48:35] like i was saying depression
[48:38] can can get ahold of us even as as
[48:40] believers and and it can be a result of
[48:43] our own decisions or it could be a
[48:45] result of someone leaving us or someone
[48:47] dying or something like that happening
[48:51] and
[48:52] and there is a time to grieve and a time
[48:54] to be happy just like the bible says
[48:57] but if we stay down and we stay
[48:59] and stay down like that then then we'll
[49:02] never
[49:03] um get get to the place where god wants
[49:05] us to be god doesn't want us to stay
[49:07] down and sad and in in a bad mood all
[49:10] the time he wants us to have joy and
[49:12] peace and if we look to him we will have
[49:15] joy and peace
[49:18] and and we will you know if
[49:20] we if we just get through this and and
[49:24] get over the the depression and get over
[49:26] all these
[49:27] anything that's hindering us from from
[49:31] that
[49:33] joy and peace that that god gives us
[49:44] now i was thinking like um in
[49:47] in
[49:48] matthew 18 and 23
[50:07] well matthew chapter 13
[50:10] verse 18 to 23.
[50:35] i was on the wrong
[50:36] chapter there sorry um
[50:41] hear you there for the parable of the
[50:44] sower
[50:45] when anyone hear the word of the kingdom
[50:48] and understandeth it not then when it
[50:51] catches the way
[50:52] that which was sown in the heart this
[50:56] is he which received seed by the wayside
[50:59] but he that received the seed into stony
[51:02] places the same is he that hear the word
[51:05] and
[51:06] and on um with joy receiveth it
[51:10] yet
[51:11] hath he not root in himself
[51:14] but during
[51:15] death for a while for when tribulation
[51:18] and persecution ariseth
[51:20] because of the word by and by he is
[51:23] offended there's so many people that
[51:25] that received this message and and uh
[51:28] received the word
[51:30] and
[51:31] but but
[51:32] all of a sudden things start going wrong
[51:34] and things start
[51:36] falling apart and then they give up
[51:39] they say i can't take this anymore
[51:41] things that are going bad for me
[51:43] tribulations have arise
[51:46] and then they give up they say that's it
[51:50] i'm not doing this anymore and they walk
[51:52] away and backside and go back to the
[51:54] world because they couldn't take it
[51:56] and that's these people that didn't have
[51:58] root in them they couldn't hold on when
[52:01] things got tough and in the tribulations
[52:04] came and persecution came
[52:06] by and by they they um
[52:10] they
[52:11] they fell away and they gave up
[52:14] and and and and sometimes it's like that
[52:17] you don't know
[52:18] should i give up
[52:20] i thought about giving up at one point
[52:22] in my life but i was i was um
[52:26] young at the time i was like
[52:28] i think like 13 i thought to myself
[52:32] this is so hard
[52:34] like
[52:35] you know i was
[52:36] in that time i was in the middle of
[52:39] a struggle and and
[52:42] it was the hardest struggle of my life
[52:45] and and to this day i've never witnessed
[52:48] and
[52:50] any kind
[52:51] of
[52:52] and what it was
[52:55] what it was what every single man almost
[52:58] that deals with and that's that's lust i
[53:00] was dealing with um uh pornography and
[53:03] stuff
[53:04] even me in aping
[53:07] so so
[53:09] um
[53:11] even me i struggle with with pornography
[53:14] just like
[53:15] um
[53:16] almost every single
[53:18] i i i'm pretty sure this is there's this
[53:21] statistic like 90 percent of every a boy
[53:25] in in this age has has either
[53:28] um seen it at one time or not in it and
[53:30] i believe that this needed to be
[53:32] addressed and i was thinking it needed
[53:33] to be addressed just like brother brad
[53:36] had said i was thinking before that i
[53:37] was thinking this this got to be
[53:39] addressed because
[53:41] there are so many people that are still
[53:43] struggling with this to this day
[53:45] and it's the hardest thing to overcome
[53:47] because it as like like i was preaching
[53:50] last time that the dopamine and stuff
[53:53] it that's the the most pleasure feeling
[53:56] any
[53:57] anyone can experience almost
[54:00] and and um that that kind of thing
[54:03] it held me down it pulled me down and i
[54:06] couldn't i couldn't hardly escape and i
[54:07] thought
[54:09] should i just give up
[54:11] i i thought about giving up i thought
[54:14] should i just give up and just forget
[54:16] about this whole thing because i i
[54:19] fought battle after battle after battle
[54:21] my entire life
[54:22] and and i'm just i'm still still young
[54:25] and i
[54:27] know there's many battles
[54:29] those to come but
[54:31] as a as a christian i know that that we
[54:34] we have to fight every single day
[54:36] against our own flesh because it's a
[54:38] waging war and we have to overcome the
[54:42] devil we have to to say
[54:45] no we have to we have to pick up the
[54:48] take of the cross and follow
[54:51] christ daily and
[54:53] and i was thinking or
[54:55] i was thinking earlier or today like
[54:59] you can
[55:01] not take up
[55:06] you can't because you're either gonna be
[55:08] holding the burdens or you're gonna be
[55:09] holding the cross either one you cannot
[55:12] hold both
[55:13] so so you have to lay down your burdens
[55:16] and and i i was
[55:18] thinking how how do we do that how do we
[55:22] lay down that burdens like
[55:23] if you have a lot of burdens that that's
[55:26] kind of hard to get rid of
[55:28] because
[55:29] it's it and it is hard
[55:32] and and it it
[55:34] i don't think it's an overnight thing
[55:35] now you can lay down every single bird
[55:37] and at once
[55:38] sometimes it takes it takes throwing out
[55:41] what one burden at a time and one burden
[55:44] at a time it just
[55:47] to
[55:48] um
[55:50] just to to
[55:52] be able to pick up that cross and follow
[55:55] christ and crucify your flesh
[55:57] daily and it is hard especially as a
[56:00] young person and you have to overcome
[56:03] the daily temptations
[56:06] every every single day it's a fight
[56:08] every single day we have to put on the
[56:10] full armor of god and keep
[56:12] fighting because we cannot win
[56:15] the war
[56:17] without
[56:19] without getting rid of our burdens and
[56:21] and following in christ
[56:30] the battles may be hard but we gotta put
[56:33] on a former
[56:35] a full armor of god and keep marching
[56:37] forward and never give up there may be
[56:39] things in our way like sickness
[56:42] just keep marching forward and just
[56:43] believe you overcome it now that's not
[56:46] the easiest thing to do i i know that
[56:48] from experience
[56:50] but and but we we just have to
[56:53] over overcome all doubt and overcome all
[56:55] unbelief
[56:56] and and keep marching forward
[57:00] we might fall into temptation and sin
[57:02] but get back up again you haven't lost
[57:05] it's just when you give up that's when
[57:07] you lose satan knocks you down get right
[57:09] back up again and keep fighting
[57:13] now i've i've um had the the moments
[57:16] that that i i fell down and sinned and i
[57:20] just felt like
[57:22] how could god still love me after all
[57:24] all this i keep falling down and and i i
[57:27] thought i've been and had those
[57:31] um thoughts um
[57:33] like um
[57:35] if you if you send it in willingly
[57:39] then um there's no more forgiveness for
[57:41] sins and then and then that's when satan
[57:43] tried telling me oh
[57:45] you can't be forgiven anymore
[57:48] you're done don't sin willingly
[57:50] well
[57:51] the thing is
[57:53] if you're still fighting and you're stu
[57:54] is still desiring to follow god then and
[57:56] still desiring to do what god wants you
[57:59] to do and get away from this and you
[58:01] desire not to do that
[58:03] then then you haven't sinned willingly
[58:05] it's it's when you you stay down and you
[58:08] say i want to keep doing this i want to
[58:10] keep sinning that's when when you're
[58:14] saying willingly when you walk away from
[58:15] god and don't come back
[58:21] now um
[58:22] losing a battle now it really hurts to
[58:25] lose battle against temptation but but
[58:28] we can't stay feeling guilty about it
[58:31] that that was that was definitely me
[58:33] feeling guilty about it for a long time
[58:35] especially especially if you're really
[58:38] close to god and then you
[58:40] then fall and slip up and fall into sin
[58:44] that's not going to change the past
[58:46] what's done is done move on
[58:49] same with being anxious about the future
[58:51] that's not going to change the future
[58:53] and
[58:54] and and sometimes we get so so anxious
[58:57] about the future like what's going to
[58:58] happen tomorrow
[59:00] and
[59:01] like that's not going to change anything
[59:03] that's going to happen that's just worry
[59:06] spend all your time
[59:08] um
[59:09] being patient and trusting god rather
[59:11] than worrying
[59:13] and
[59:16] now i i got this uh this uh famous
[59:19] speech from from the movie i haven't
[59:20] watched it the movie but here it is
[59:23] um somewhere along the line um you you
[59:27] change you stop being you you let people
[59:29] stick a finger in your face and tell you
[59:32] you're no good and when things got hard
[59:34] you started looking for
[59:36] a big shadow
[59:38] let me tell you something you already
[59:40] know the world ain't all sunshine or
[59:41] rainbows it's very mean
[59:44] and nasty place and i don't care how
[59:47] tough you are it will beat you to your
[59:49] knees and keep you there permanently if
[59:51] you let it
[59:53] you me or nobody's gonna hit as hard as
[59:56] life but it ain't about how hard you hit
[59:58] it's about how hard and you can get hit
[1:00:01] and keep moving forward
[1:00:03] how much you can take him and keep
[1:00:06] moving forward that's how winning is
[1:00:07] done
[1:00:09] now now if you know what you're worth
[1:00:11] and then go out and
[1:00:13] and get it get what you're worth
[1:00:15] but you gotta be willing to pick the
[1:00:17] hits and not pointing fingers and saying
[1:00:21] um you ain't where you want to be
[1:00:23] because of him or her or anybody cowards
[1:00:26] do that and that ain't you
[1:00:29] and and that that is is that's very true
[1:00:33] i mean in the world and the world is
[1:00:36] a horrible place and the world will beat
[1:00:39] you down and and and keep you there if
[1:00:41] you let it and
[1:00:44] and and um we we do fall down and get
[1:00:47] hit down and we feel like oh
[1:00:50] you know how do i
[1:00:52] get out of this place i can't
[1:00:54] escape and and
[1:00:56] some people they go to
[1:00:59] to um
[1:01:01] drugs they go to
[1:01:02] alcohol and they go to
[1:01:05] to
[1:01:06] all these other things and for me i went
[1:01:07] to music
[1:01:09] and sometimes you think that the way out
[1:01:12] of it is
[1:01:13] is um suicide like
[1:01:19] and
[1:01:21] i was just
[1:01:22] thinking if if aaron and you would have
[1:01:26] went through it
[1:01:27] that and you and you would have actually
[1:01:29] killed yourself i would have showed up
[1:01:30] to your grave and
[1:01:33] and i would have wet
[1:01:37] because
[1:01:39] you were you were one of my um
[1:01:42] best friends i would have been really
[1:01:44] wet
[1:01:45] i didn't i should have reached out to
[1:01:47] you and asked what's going on but i
[1:01:50] didn't i was always busy and stuff but
[1:02:00] i would have
[1:02:02] because because you don't realize how
[1:02:05] how um
[1:02:08] you you only realize how many people
[1:02:10] actually love you if you if can you
[1:02:13] imagine
[1:02:14] um being um
[1:02:17] dead and you and uh and god allowed you
[1:02:20] to to see yourself and all the people
[1:02:22] around around your grave
[1:02:24] and weeping for you
[1:02:26] and
[1:02:28] i thought about
[1:02:29] um
[1:02:32] suicide did cross my mind before
[1:02:36] but
[1:02:37] but i never actually i always knew that
[1:02:40] that uh that was a bad idea
[1:02:43] and that that
[1:02:45] and and that one time when i when i
[1:02:47] almost was killed
[1:02:49] to when um
[1:02:53] two i started thinking back to when
[1:02:56] um
[1:02:58] you know if you know
[1:03:00] i started thinking over my life
[1:03:02] and thinking where would i have gone
[1:03:05] would i be it would have went to heaven
[1:03:07] and or would have went to hell i was
[1:03:09] like i don't know
[1:03:12] and when you don't know
[1:03:14] you're not in a very good place in your
[1:03:16] life and that and that was during a time
[1:03:18] when i was listening to
[1:03:20] rap music and
[1:03:21] and that stuff and i was
[1:03:24] in a depressed kind of state not even
[1:03:26] and made worse and and when i got home
[1:03:30] you know how i'll i'll say this
[1:03:32] testimony again if anyone forgot
[1:03:35] i was
[1:03:36] um
[1:03:38] riding a
[1:03:39] a lawn mower and and i went
[1:03:42] and in front of a um
[1:03:46] truck
[1:03:47] and it was pulling a a trailer um with a
[1:03:50] tractor on it and he almost hit me
[1:03:52] and he went
[1:03:54] i didn't realize it until later he came
[1:03:56] to it to the door and he was like saying
[1:03:58] how that that um
[1:04:00] he
[1:04:01] he was like who's the lucky
[1:04:03] guy and whatever he was saying like a
[1:04:05] bunch of filthy words and stuff and i
[1:04:07] was like
[1:04:09] well my dad said it was me and i was
[1:04:12] like hey
[1:04:14] and then
[1:04:15] i was like i all of a sudden realize i
[1:04:17] just had a vision a few days ago of
[1:04:19] myself being hit by a truck
[1:04:22] and being thrown far away that nothing
[1:04:25] like that's ever happened to me being
[1:04:27] before and that that
[1:04:29] night i knew something special about
[1:04:31] that that vision i had because i was
[1:04:32] constantly shaking awake by a vibration
[1:04:35] feeling all throughout my body and it
[1:04:38] was so traumatizing that night i felt
[1:04:41] like it was a demon that was tormenting
[1:04:43] me and i was praying like
[1:04:45] god please take this
[1:04:47] thing that's uh
[1:04:49] that's making this happen to me and then
[1:04:53] and then like i said and
[1:04:55] i had that vision and then and then i
[1:04:57] was thinking on the way
[1:04:58] home from from that
[1:05:01] um
[1:05:03] sitting in the back seat i was
[1:05:05] i was traumatized because because i what
[1:05:08] just happened to me like i i was
[1:05:10] supposed to die that day and i didn't
[1:05:12] and where would i have gone where i've
[1:05:14] gone to hell or would have gone to
[1:05:15] heaven i was like you know i didn't i
[1:05:17] didn't know it was like it was so so
[1:05:20] traumatic when i got home i wept and i
[1:05:22] said how i had that vision that night
[1:05:24] and i was like i was supposed to die
[1:05:26] that day
[1:05:28] but i didn't
[1:05:29] and here i am today still alive because
[1:05:32] god had a purpose for me and he wasn't
[1:05:34] gonna let me die because
[1:05:36] because he had he had something better
[1:05:38] for me than then to die that day i
[1:05:40] wasn't going to die that day because
[1:05:45] because god sells a plan for you if
[1:05:47] you're still alive if god hasn't and let
[1:05:50] you die yet he still haven't he still
[1:05:53] has a plan for you
[1:05:56] and and i i was gonna die
[1:06:00] but god didn't let it it happened
[1:06:03] i was supposed to die many times and i
[1:06:06] had almost stepped on a a snake in in
[1:06:10] that one time a big old snake when i was
[1:06:12] little
[1:06:13] it was a venomous snake
[1:06:15] and and it didn't it didn't i um i think
[1:06:18] i may have even stepped on it but it
[1:06:20] didn't bite he was caught up in in
[1:06:23] in that place and there there's been
[1:06:25] many times when when i i could have died
[1:06:29] that day but god kept me safe because he
[1:06:31] still has a he still has a plan for me
[1:06:33] he's not done with me yet
[1:06:35] and i say say this then you're still
[1:06:37] here god ain't done with you
[1:06:40] so don't give up
[1:06:44] keep keep going
[1:06:46] i don't care how tough it gets
[1:06:48] there it's going to get better and
[1:06:51] and i was just thinking
[1:06:54] about this verse
[1:06:57] if
[1:06:59] if things are getting tough if
[1:07:02] if things
[1:07:04] things are getting really really really
[1:07:07] bad for you and and if everything goes
[1:07:11] down
[1:07:12] like it's said to go down if
[1:07:14] if
[1:07:17] if we're put in these these camps and
[1:07:20] stuff and they torture us and and
[1:07:21] everything's getting really bad just
[1:07:23] know this
[1:07:25] that that in revelations 21 4 says and
[1:07:28] god shall wipe away all tears from their
[1:07:30] eyes and there shall be no more death
[1:07:33] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[1:07:36] there be any more pain for the former
[1:07:38] things that passed away
[1:07:42] i say even if
[1:07:44] even if
[1:07:46] you're going through the um the worst
[1:07:48] thing
[1:07:49] that anyone has ever gone through
[1:07:55] it's gonna get better
[1:07:58] if you're if you're a christian we've
[1:07:59] gotta hope and everything will
[1:08:02] be better everything will be all right
[1:08:04] because god has a plan for each and
[1:08:06] every one of us and if we don't
[1:08:08] understand it
[1:08:11] even if we don't understand it
[1:08:14] it's gonna be
[1:08:15] it's gonna be okay
[1:08:17] to just keep holding on keep
[1:08:20] marching forward don't you give up
[1:08:24] and
[1:08:25] just like i was saying just like how um
[1:08:29] even even william brandon tried to
[1:08:31] commit suicide he put a gun to his head
[1:08:34] and he pulled the trigger
[1:08:36] it didn't go off and then he threw it
[1:08:38] down and it went off just like that so
[1:08:41] it was supposed to go off and just like
[1:08:43] an ordinary gun is supposed to but god
[1:08:45] didn't let it because god wasn't done
[1:08:47] with him
[1:08:48] and god won't
[1:08:50] let you die until until he's done with
[1:08:53] you even if you decide to give up
[1:08:57] just like aaron and here had decided to
[1:08:59] give up but jesus held back
[1:09:01] his his hand
[1:09:06] and god wasn't going to let
[1:09:08] you give up if if he was if he was just
[1:09:11] doing it it
[1:09:13] if he wasn't if he wasn't holding your
[1:09:16] hand back just for your sake he was
[1:09:17] holding your hand back just for my sake
[1:09:19] just for your family's sake
[1:09:23] because because god knows that that we
[1:09:26] would be
[1:09:27] mourning for you right now
[1:09:30] if if you had done that
[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:46] brother brother branham once said
[1:09:49] must jesus by the cross alone and
[1:09:52] everyone else go free
[1:09:54] there's a cross for everyone and there's
[1:09:56] a cross for me
[1:09:57] all this isn't a flowery bed of ease
[1:10:01] just like and just like he said we we've
[1:10:03] got to to go through these trials it's
[1:10:06] it's our destiny it's it's we have to
[1:10:10] but it's our duty it's our duty to keep
[1:10:13] getting up against our duty to keep
[1:10:15] marching forward it's our duty to to
[1:10:17] just keep holding on and hold on and
[1:10:20] carry the cross and and keep marching
[1:10:23] forward
[1:10:25] because we can't
[1:10:26] give up
[1:10:33] um
[1:10:44] god never said we wouldn't go through
[1:10:46] trials and tribulations in fact he made
[1:10:48] it clear that we would suffer for a sake
[1:10:51] remember that parable that jesus talked
[1:10:53] about if you have built your house upon
[1:10:56] the rock when you go through things
[1:10:58] remember you're in the house when the
[1:11:00] storms arise which they will
[1:11:03] don't lose hope because your house will
[1:11:06] stand no matter how rough the wind gets
[1:11:08] if your house is built on that rock it
[1:11:10] shall stand
[1:11:17] and and just like um
[1:11:20] that song that the anchor holds
[1:11:23] let's say um you're you're on that ship
[1:11:26] right
[1:11:27] let's say let's say you're on that ship
[1:11:29] you're in in a storm and the captain
[1:11:31] says lower the anchor because he's the
[1:11:33] captain knows best if you don't listen
[1:11:36] the ship might sink
[1:11:38] but you can't blame the captain because
[1:11:40] he told you to lower the anchor don't
[1:11:42] don't think that if
[1:11:44] if we just lower the sails that'll do it
[1:11:46] no there's got to be an incur lord
[1:11:49] otherwise you might drown like that a
[1:11:51] song anchor holds
[1:11:55] the
[1:11:56] anchor holes in spite of the storm but
[1:11:59] the anchors got to be lowered it's it's
[1:12:01] no good saying i've got anchor on the
[1:12:03] ship
[1:12:05] and not putting it to use
[1:12:08] and and that that's right if
[1:12:10] if we don't if we don't lower that
[1:12:12] anchor
[1:12:14] what anchor have we got to hold
[1:12:17] that that anchor we got to be anchored
[1:12:19] this morning this evening
[1:12:21] but we got we got to to be anchored
[1:12:36] now um this is something that brother
[1:12:39] branham said
[1:12:41] now before you can have a victory there
[1:12:44] there has to be a battle and if there is
[1:12:45] a battle
[1:12:47] if there is no battles there's no
[1:12:49] victory we ought to be thankful for the
[1:12:52] battles and the tryings
[1:12:54] and it's god giving us the opportunity
[1:12:57] to have victories
[1:12:58] and
[1:12:59] and i was thinking also thinking like
[1:13:05] christ is a is a healer and if
[1:13:08] um
[1:13:09] and it was in him to be healed before
[1:13:10] the foundation of the world
[1:13:12] so
[1:13:14] those that are sick you might wonder why
[1:13:16] did we get sick
[1:13:18] because
[1:13:20] christ is a healer and it was in him to
[1:13:22] heal people and it was also in him to be
[1:13:25] a savior that's why and why he
[1:13:28] he had to to die on the cross for us and
[1:13:30] there and we had to be lost in order for
[1:13:32] there to be people to to
[1:13:35] to save
[1:13:36] and and
[1:13:38] some people don't understand this
[1:13:42] but that's how it is and
[1:13:59] sorry if i'm not going as as uh good out
[1:14:02] as i was on on sunday it's just because
[1:14:04] i'm nervous and also a little bit more
[1:14:07] tired than on a sunday morning but
[1:14:10] but i'm trying
[1:14:20] but um
[1:14:22] like
[1:14:23] the the
[1:14:26] skinny fog that was in that um
[1:14:29] that bucket
[1:14:34] we might may feel like like giving up
[1:14:39] we might feel like a hope is lost
[1:14:44] it's it's not
[1:14:45] if you keep going on then then he will
[1:14:48] get through
[1:14:49] now um
[1:14:51] a while ago um
[1:14:53] i heard about the uss constitution
[1:14:57] the ship that that's never
[1:15:00] lost any any battle it was on a saturday
[1:15:03] not too long ago my uncle showed me a
[1:15:05] new poster he bought
[1:15:08] he said it was of the uss constitution a
[1:15:11] battleship that had been through
[1:15:13] numerous battles and never lost it's the
[1:15:16] the oldest ship still afloat
[1:15:19] i said if i i ever went on that ship in
[1:15:21] that time i would have a lot of
[1:15:23] confidence in it if and never lost the
[1:15:25] battle the the next day
[1:15:28] well i was just thinking if it never
[1:15:30] lost the battle
[1:15:32] that's a lot to do with
[1:15:34] jesus christ he's never lost a battle
[1:15:36] and if we're in christ
[1:15:38] if if we're in christ and we trust in
[1:15:40] him even though it looks like things are
[1:15:42] falling apart even if it looks like
[1:15:44] everything is crashing down he's never
[1:15:46] lost a battle and we can have confidence
[1:15:49] in that even if we lose battles
[1:15:53] even if we
[1:15:54] fail and mess up and and
[1:15:56] we we do all these things the stupid
[1:15:59] things that we do sometimes and mess up
[1:16:01] and fall and all way to temptations
[1:16:04] jesus christ has never failed one time
[1:16:08] and and we we can have confidence in
[1:16:11] that and know
[1:16:12] that he will get us through he will get
[1:16:15] us through the battles if we just trust
[1:16:17] in him with all all that we got in all
[1:16:20] of our mind and all of our soul if we
[1:16:21] just trust in him with everything that
[1:16:23] we've got
[1:16:28] we need to just trust
[1:16:30] in the one that's never lost a battle
[1:16:35] the next day i started thinking about
[1:16:36] that we're on the ship that has never
[1:16:38] lost a battle just like i was saying
[1:16:41] those there in christ are on the
[1:16:43] battleship that never lost and with
[1:16:44] captains that always help us through
[1:16:47] every storm
[1:16:48] the ship may be battered but
[1:16:53] but
[1:16:54] just keep going the anchor will hold the
[1:16:57] ship isn't going to sink just hold on
[1:17:00] don't give up
[1:17:02] if you're going through a storm right
[1:17:04] now
[1:17:05] you're going to make it
[1:17:06] the storm will pass just be patient god
[1:17:09] is in control
[1:17:10] and and
[1:17:12] i didn't write this entire sermon
[1:17:15] it wasn't just inspired by what aaron
[1:17:17] said i wrote this before then
[1:17:20] and i i do and i just went off of that i
[1:17:23] was like
[1:17:25] is that a coincidence that that aaron
[1:17:28] was about to
[1:17:30] do that and
[1:17:34] and i'm not putting any shame on you
[1:17:36] aaron because
[1:17:38] and i i forgive you for that man
[1:17:40] but
[1:17:44] i've i've been there i know i know what
[1:17:46] it's like to be in that kind of pressed
[1:17:49] state
[1:17:51] and and i i know that that um
[1:17:55] it can get extremely rough so
[1:17:59] and you
[1:18:00] get filled with so much pain and so much
[1:18:03] agony from what life throws at you and
[1:18:06] people
[1:18:07] leaving and everywhere even if
[1:18:09] all your
[1:18:10] you lose all your friends and and
[1:18:12] everyone leaves you you still got christ
[1:18:14] on your side and and he was the one that
[1:18:17] stopped you and he's the one that
[1:18:19] will lead you through the rest of your
[1:18:22] life just keep trusting in him and he'll
[1:18:25] get you through
[1:18:26] everything and get you through all
[1:18:28] the depression and all the things the
[1:18:30] world throws at you because he is god
[1:18:34] and he does care about you
[1:18:49] the stolen will pass just be patient god
[1:18:51] is in control
[1:19:09] in mark 13 13 says and ye shall be hated
[1:19:13] of all men for my name's sake but he
[1:19:15] that that shall endure unto the end this
[1:19:18] shame the same shall be
[1:19:20] saved that that's what we got to do
[1:19:24] everyone we got to endure through the
[1:19:26] end through every tribulation that will
[1:19:27] come and it will come it's not going to
[1:19:30] be all cupcakes and rainbows
[1:19:32] but we got to keep going and and just
[1:19:36] just keep marching forward and like like
[1:19:38] james 5 11 and says
[1:19:42] behold we count them happy with gender
[1:19:45] you have heard of the patience of job
[1:19:48] and have seen the end of the lord and
[1:19:51] that the lord is very pitiful and
[1:19:54] have tender mercy
[1:19:57] so even when we we do decide
[1:20:00] we can't take this anymore god is still
[1:20:02] full of mercy and holds back our hand
[1:20:05] from from doing any harm to ourselves
[1:20:08] and and stops us from from doing
[1:20:10] anything anything like that or or um bad
[1:20:13] things that like that might harm us so
[1:20:16] stop it because
[1:20:19] because of his tender mercy god will
[1:20:21] allow
[1:20:22] bad things to happen sometimes and and
[1:20:25] um god will
[1:20:27] uh
[1:20:28] chastise us sometimes and
[1:20:30] and the bible says that we and we have
[1:20:32] to and god builds our character
[1:20:36] so
[1:20:37] if we we just think
[1:20:39] and why is all these these bad things
[1:20:41] happening why is everything crashing
[1:20:43] down
[1:20:45] just
[1:20:46] know that that um
[1:20:49] that god is in control
[1:20:52] and and know that that um and just
[1:20:54] trusting god every every single day and
[1:20:57] i know it's it can be hard sometimes but
[1:21:00] just keep going just keep enduring
[1:21:02] through the end for
[1:21:05] everything
[1:21:07] will will be all right in the end
[1:21:12] and there will be no more suffering
[1:21:14] no more affliction
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:17] no no more
[1:21:19] of of this this work this world will be
[1:21:22] no more eventually and will be
[1:21:24] in paradise and we don't have to worry
[1:21:26] about these these things in this world
[1:21:29] but right now my friend we got to endure
[1:21:32] we've got to get through it all we've
[1:21:34] got to make it
[1:21:37] we got to keep going because
[1:21:41] because
[1:21:43] we we have to we have to um
[1:21:46] endure
[1:21:48] through what comes our our ways and
[1:21:50] every day
[1:21:52] and
[1:21:54] because uh christ endured the cross
[1:22:00] and now we have to
[1:22:01] take up our cross and then dirt will
[1:22:03] come
[1:22:04] at us
[1:22:09] amen
[1:22:13] so if we if we can and have faith and
[1:22:15] know that we
[1:22:16] are
[1:22:17] anchored
[1:22:18] that no matter what
[1:22:20] comes against that ship no matter what
[1:22:22] happens
[1:22:25] we'll make it through the storm
[1:22:27] we'll make it through
[1:22:29] and and just like them um
[1:22:32] people that was on the ship uh that uh
[1:22:35] jesus was on
[1:22:37] the storms arose and everything felt
[1:22:39] like it was going to
[1:22:41] it was going to fall down but jesus was
[1:22:43] on that ship
[1:22:44] they didn't realize who was on that ship
[1:22:46] and and jesus said oh ye little faith
[1:22:50] because because jesus knew that that um
[1:22:54] everything was gonna be all right but
[1:22:56] they didn't trust enough that he was on
[1:22:57] the ship that everything would be all
[1:22:59] right
[1:23:03] and we just gotta keep going and know
[1:23:05] that there's an anchor
[1:23:07] that's holding us
[1:23:09] firm
[1:23:11] in the end and we have that anchor
[1:23:15] and then um
[1:23:18] in closing um
[1:23:22] musicians if you come
[1:23:35] now um
[1:23:37] here's another
[1:23:38] few things that
[1:23:41] brother um
[1:23:45] william brandon
[1:23:46] said god's covenant with abraham and his
[1:23:50] seed
[1:23:51] god doesn't make any difference between
[1:23:53] his
[1:23:54] children every son that cometh to god
[1:23:57] and must first be tried or chastised
[1:24:00] you get it first be tried your chastised
[1:24:03] corrected child trained
[1:24:06] scold everyone
[1:24:08] and not not one exception every son
[1:24:12] have you went through trials
[1:24:15] have you went through tribulation
[1:24:17] have you suffered persecution
[1:24:20] then then
[1:24:22] then you endure these things you
[1:24:26] you are are real children of god but
[1:24:29] when you can
[1:24:31] bear chastisement when the rod comes
[1:24:34] down heavy and you run off and back into
[1:24:36] the world
[1:24:37] the bible said you're an illegitimate
[1:24:39] child and not the the children of god
[1:24:42] for for when the man's born of the
[1:24:45] spirit of god he expects those things
[1:24:48] and he loves those things and the bible
[1:24:51] said that
[1:24:52] the trials
[1:24:54] that come upon us fiery trials
[1:24:57] is
[1:24:58] more precious
[1:24:59] than gold to us
[1:25:01] think of it
[1:25:05] amen
[1:25:08] so
[1:25:09] so when when trial come and
[1:25:12] when when bad things happen and stuff i
[1:25:14] i didn't realize this when when things
[1:25:18] things don't seem to go the way we want
[1:25:20] it to go
[1:25:21] we we need to just trust in god
[1:25:24] through it all and endure
[1:25:26] tribulations trust in god through
[1:25:29] everything because he's in control
[1:25:32] he is is the
[1:25:34] the anchor that holds the ship
[1:25:37] he is instant our firm foundation we can
[1:25:40] trust in him and know that he'll hold
[1:25:43] hold us
[1:25:44] and and
[1:25:46] no matter what
[1:25:48] happens
[1:25:50] god is in control
[1:25:55] all right
[1:25:56] let's pray
[1:25:58] or stand if you will
[1:26:03] let's pray
[1:26:04] father god

[1:26:28] happen to us sometimes we think that
[1:26:30] lord
[1:26:32] but we need to understand that you're in
[1:26:33] control of god
[1:26:35] you're in control of it all no matter
[1:26:37] what happens no matter what trials come

[1:27:27] help us to to know that and understand
[1:27:31] where our place is lord
[1:27:32] that that satan is just trying to

[1:28:05] lord jesus christ
[1:28:07] amen
[1:28:12] if you could play something softly
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:21] if if anyone's dealing with
[1:28:24] sickness or or anything that's going on
[1:28:27] that that they need need help they need
[1:28:30] they need some help
[1:28:33] we should we should be
[1:28:35] kind to one another and and if if some
[1:28:38] we're going through trials
[1:28:40] confess it to to one another not just
[1:28:42] hold it all inside sometimes we just
[1:28:45] want to hold it all inside because
[1:28:47] but the pressure can sometimes explode
[1:28:50] and and we we
[1:28:52] we try to escape it somehow
[1:28:55] we try to get out
[1:28:57] somehow sometimes
[1:28:59] simply agent just praying and stuff and
[1:29:02] trying to fight it alone
[1:29:04] and what won't work very well
[1:29:07] if we can just reach out to someone for
[1:29:11] for help to tell someone i always
[1:29:13] thought it'd be nice to just be able to
[1:29:16] tell someone all that
[1:29:18] is happening and you know and how you
[1:29:20] feel and
[1:29:22] everything instead of just saying i'm
[1:29:24] just fine
[1:29:25] i'm okay
[1:29:26] you know
[1:29:27] sometimes i remember that people would
[1:29:30] ask are you are you are you okay how are
[1:29:32] you doing
[1:29:33] i'm fine
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:36] but i'm
[1:29:37] on a face express a fake expression i
[1:29:40] would
[1:29:41] i did that
[1:29:44] make it look like i'm happy
[1:29:48] try to try to put on on some fake act
[1:29:51] make it look like i'm okay
[1:29:54] when i wasn't
[1:29:56] and and i know what it's like if you're
[1:29:59] going through depression
[1:30:01] god can help you with that
[1:30:03] in fact he can he can deliver you from
[1:30:06] depression
[1:30:07] all together it's just a spirit of
[1:30:10] sadness is is
[1:30:12] it's called a medical illness here but i
[1:30:14] just call it a a spirit it's an evil
[1:30:17] spirit
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:21] if if it's in the form of mourning then
[1:30:24] then it might not necessarily be
[1:30:27] an evil spirit but it's a sad
[1:30:30] thing to to see people suffering with
[1:30:32] with depression
[1:30:34] and and things like that and i i want to
[1:30:38] be able to do my part to try to help but
[1:30:41] in the end god can only help you with
[1:30:44] that because i can try to comfort you
[1:30:46] and and do all the best i can but
[1:30:50] but god i can help you if you just lay
[1:30:52] all your burdens down and give it all to
[1:30:55] him
[1:30:56] he can and
[1:30:58] relieve you of those burdens
[1:31:04] with the depression and stuff it's just
[1:31:08] it is hard
[1:31:10] it's very hard
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:13] and
[1:31:14] i have this this story
[1:31:16] i should have said before
[1:31:18] but
[1:31:20] at work there was
[1:31:22] um there was someone that that had a
[1:31:25] really bad toothache one day couldn't
[1:31:26] hardly work
[1:31:28] and
[1:31:29] and i was just thinking
[1:31:30] and i know my god can deliver him from
[1:31:33] that
[1:31:34] and and so somehow i felt on my heart i
[1:31:38] had to go pray for him i asked him if if
[1:31:41] you would
[1:31:42] let me pray for you and and so
[1:31:45] i prayed for him
[1:31:46] and he he said it just a little better
[1:31:49] but but um
[1:31:50] i told him about
[1:31:52] how that if he had faith
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:55] if he he had faith
[1:31:57] and enough faith he could be healed and
[1:32:00] so so i decided
[1:32:02] to pray for him again i
[1:32:05] had to pray for him again because he
[1:32:06] still had that toothache even though
[1:32:09] though it was based on his faith i
[1:32:10] didn't tell him that the first time so
[1:32:13] this time i i i felt
[1:32:16] i felt um inspired to say and i was
[1:32:20] i started praying i put my hand on his
[1:32:22] is
[1:32:24] on his face where his toothache was at
[1:32:26] and i said in the name of jesus christ
[1:32:28] you're healed
[1:32:30] i just that was just such an inspiration
[1:32:32] that came over me to say that and he
[1:32:34] said it was it
[1:32:36] there it was it was healed instantly
[1:32:38] god can heal instantly i know we can if
[1:32:42] you had the faith in that moment to
[1:32:44] believe
[1:32:46] evie can't
[1:32:47] [Music]
[1:32:49] he can't heal instantly and i don't know
[1:32:51] if i have the gift of healing or not but
[1:32:55] but i know we can and you you're healed
[1:32:58] already if you just believe it
[1:33:01] all you have to do is just accept it
[1:33:03] just accept the healing and
[1:33:06] there's been in times sometimes he'll
[1:33:08] he'll heal you after
[1:33:10] a while or whatever sometimes it takes
[1:33:12] time i prayed for different people at
[1:33:14] work
[1:33:15] and stuff and and they got healed and
[1:33:18] and different things like that
[1:33:21] but it didn't wasn't all instantly but
[1:33:23] in that that moment i did feel inspired
[1:33:26] to say that and and i believe because i
[1:33:29] felt inspired to say that he believed in
[1:33:32] that moment as well and accepted it
[1:33:35] so
[1:33:36] if anyone is is sick
[1:33:38] is if anyone has anything the author is
