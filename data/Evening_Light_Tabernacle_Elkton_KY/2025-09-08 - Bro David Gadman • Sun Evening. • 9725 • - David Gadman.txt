[Applause] Appreciate that, Sister Lisa. Amen. You ready to hear the word this evening? A man who's come with great expectations. Amen. Let's stand. We're going to invite Brother David this evening to preach what the Lord's laid on his heart and listening to the master of the wind as he comes this evening. My boat of life sails on a troubled sea. Ever there's a wind in my sail. But I have a friend who watches over me when the breeze turns into a game. I know the master of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. He can calm the storm, make the sun to shine again. I know the master of the way. Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the sky. Among the peaks my soul can be found. But an unexpected storm may drive me from the heights. It may bring me low, but it'll never bring me down. For I know the master of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. Bless you. The sun is shine again. I know the master of the wind. Let's do that one more time, can we? Oh, I know the master of the wind. [Music] I know the [Music] [Music] Sun to shine again. You know the monster of the wind. Amen. You believe that tonight or this afternoon? You know the maker of the wind. Amen. I I I tell you what, I'm glad I know him tonight. Amen. If it wasn't for him, where would I be at? Amen. But I appreciate him. I tell you what, you hear them songs and everything, I just want to get excited, but I can't get, you know, right now to excited. But I tell you what, I appreciate the Lord. Amen. makes me I tell you what I can run with the best of them, &gt;&gt; shout with the best of them, dance with the best of them, but all that you know that long as you then that's good and that's fine in its place but I want to make sure that I know the master of the wind. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I know him. Amen. Brother Brimson, you can know you can know this Bible frontwards and backwards. You can know all the catechism. You can know everything and that's not life. But to know him is life. And that's what I want. I want to know him. Amen. You believe that? And I I just uh appreciate Brother Tom inviting us this weekend. And it's too bad he ain't here. Brother Brad and neither one. I seen Brother Brad up at uh Brother Joseph's uh what been &gt;&gt; couple weeks ago uh at Brother Joseph Hammond's uh a couple weeks ago. Brother Homer was up there preaching. Brother Joseph Hammond's uh uh anniversary 30 years. And uh so we went up there. We wasn't preaching. We', you know, taken a rest since our surgery. And we went up there, hear brother Homer, our pastor. So had some good times and everything. And brother David told me said that it was brother Brad's first time of hearing brother Homer meeting Brother Homer. I said, "Well, once did you meet Brother Homer?" That's it. You know, that's all you had to say. God only made one of Brother Homer. Thank God. Amen. My wife tells me said, "Go anywhere and preach you want to. just never repeat what brother Homer says. See, he says, "Brother Homer can get by with it." Said, "You won't be able to." So, I understand. I understand. But I appreciate Brother Homer, my pastor. Like I said, we've been there uh 24 years. Uh well, it be let's see the 9th of September, which is uh Tuesday, I think it is, or something like that. So, been with brother Homer. Well, we knew him back, you know, in Amarella and different places. You know, his wife, Sister Margie, is actually my mom's cousin. And so, you know, we're just kind of, Brother Homer always told me, he said, "Anything ever happened to Sister Margie, you're history." So, instead of praying for Brother Homer, I prayed for Sister Margie a whole lot. And when she was passing away, when she was there in a hospital, you know, just no couple days, you know, there she would gone. I was crying and somebody said, "Gary, her, you know, brother Gary's son, Dave ain't crying cuz this Marty's my mom's leaving. He's crying because, you know, he's gonna be history. So, you know how it is. They always give me a hard time. So, anyway, I tried to give them a hard time, too, you know. So, but I ain't going to say what I say about the rest of them, but you know, that's neither here nor there. But anyway, we appreciate having us and we appreciate being here. Appreciate good service this morning. So, we trust that God's got something for us again tonight. Amen. If you have your Bibles, turn with me to the book of Psalms, chapter 133. and we'll just look at this Psalms here coming from the book of Psalms this weekend. So, you just keep me in prayer, you know, since uh uh somebody had called me and been checking up on me. I preached for him several several times and he said, "No, Brother David, once you get to feeling better after you recover from your surgery, put me on your list first." So, I ain't going to tell him that I came here first, you know. So, Amen. But anyway, we appreciate, you know, different ones praying for us and everything, you know, just just, you know, we just appreciate that prayer means a whole lot. Abraham said one place he said, "I don't solicit your money, but I sure do solicit your prayers." &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 133:1, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. is like the precious ointment upon the beard that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's that went down to the skirts of his garments as the do of Herman and as the do of the that descended upon the mountains of Zion. For there the Lord commanded the blessings, even life forever more. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. How many's got a need? Father, we just ask, oh God, that you just once again come, Lord, and be with us again this afternoon, Father. And Lord, we're just so needful of you this afternoon, Father, to morning service. It was history, Father, but Lord, we just we just want to ask you to stop by once again this afternoon, Lord, and visit with us, Lord Jesus. Lord, we just ask, Lord, that you'd help me, Father. Lord, I need your help more than I ever had, Lord. And Father, I pray, oh God, that you just be with us, oh God, as we endeavor to try to say something that would be a blessing to your people, Lord, this afternoon. I pray, Lord, you just help me, Father. Let me get myself out of the way, Father, and you speak to us, Lord, through your word, Lord. Maybe you already spoke through us, maybe through a song, Lord, that special, Lord, congregational, whatever it may be, Lord. We so thank you, Lord, for your goodness and your mercy to us, oh God. Thank you for allowing it to follow us, Lord, all of our days. Lord, we just ask, Lord, you continue to be with us, Lord. Help us, Father. You saw the hands. You know what was behind each and every hand. Pray Lord you just take care of each and every one. Lord, continue to touch Brother Tom. Lord, different ones. Brother Brad, different ones. Lord, there's been one sick at our church. Lord, different ones things going around. Father, it just seems like every time you turn around, Lord, got a brother's always texting me about different prayer requests. Seems like every time you turn around, Lord, there's somebody needs you, Lord. I pray, Lord, you just minister to your bride around the world, Lord, where they may be gathered at this afternoon, Lord. Just touch and heal, sanctify, Lord, fill all with the Holy Ghost, Lord. Save the lost, Lord. And Father, we be comforted to give you the glory and the praise for it all. For we ask these things in Jesus' name. Amen. and you may be seated. Try not to hold you too long this afternoon, but just uh like I said, we appreciate being here this weekend and just wish I had more strength than what I do. But you know, maybe I come back and one of these days and do it again. But you know, if we never meet again this side, we're going to meet you over there. Amen. That's the place I want to be. where brother Bram described it on that film Decath of Deep. He said table spread thousands of miles. You're sitting across from battlecard veterans. Amen. And the king comes out, wipes the tears from her eyes, saying, "Don't cry no more. It's all over." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Enter into the joys of the Lord that's been prepared for you before the foundation of the world. That's the That's what I'm looking forward to. Just to hear me, Just to hear him say, "Well done. Well done. Amen. Excuse me. That's what I'm looking forward to. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like to talk a little bit, like I said, try not to hold you too long, but just talk a little bit on unity, our covenant with one another. Unity, our covenant with one another. And I was thinking, you know, we I want to be in unity. I never want to be divided. &gt;&gt; Divided we fall. unified we stand together &gt;&gt; and you know not to be comical or anything but you know somebody you know and I don't know how y'all around here you know and I I I don't get try not to get too mixed up in them but you know cuz you you can I guess you can do anything too much brother Ram said you could talk too much you you could uh you could uh you could sing too much you could uh do a lot of things he even said You know, brother Luke was telling me one time, brother Luke Gibson, he told me, he said, he never did he didn't get me. Then he said, I read another quote where brother said, you can talk too much, you can sing too much, you can walk too much. And so he said, but he said, you never can pray enough. Amen. And prayer changes things. And I I want to be a man of prayer. And you know, and I was just thinking, you know, and like I said, I I don't know how you, but everybody around our area, all they're big football fans. Alabama, &gt;&gt; roll tide. I get so sick of that. So anyway, when I'm first moved to Alabama, somebody said, "You need to choose your team, Alabama or Auburn." I said, "LSU?" Boy, I like to got killed, you know. I like to got I like to got my head chopped off, you know. I had me a cap, LSU. My wife was working in the daycare and they asked me to stand out because one of the one of the ladies that uh they used to have to you know walk across the street and they parked their cars across the street and one one of the young girls kind of somebody some man tried I don't know if he threatened her or what but you know how it is sometimes spoke you know maybe said something out the way so the her director asked me to kind of stand so I stood out there one day had my LSU cap on water they didn't jump me but anyway you know they had the license plates You know, I don't know. They said, uh, this is a house divided. Had Alabama on one side, the license of plate, LA, Auburn on the other side, you know, but if we just all can be united together. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be unified, to love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me just read you something. I was just looking it up and I knew Brother Brandham had said this and I thought, well, man, my this was real good. So, I'll just read this to you. It be all right. If it ain't, I'm going to read it anyhow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Now, I think that there's one thing that that this nation has done." Now, I'm an American. He said, "God knows that there there's a many a brand I probably uh uh uh flew over their uh their graves in France and so forth. You you brothers in the last war and going in this and maybe a a son too shortly. And if if it come to the like uh colors tonight, I'd be happy to walk out and give my life freely like my brother has who started like uh all the foreign uh countries uh with their uh you know with their uh blood for their family, shed their blood for their liberty that we have tonight. But there's anything that I can think of that's got a stain on our flag is a way we treated the native or the Indian. That's right. We spend billions of dollars. Listen to this. I thought, my this is good. He said, "We spend billions of dollars to or send billions of dollars to Russia for them to shoot it back at us. We send it to Japan for them to uh uh fix a war to shoot back at us. and our American Indian laying out here starving to death. But that's not right. It's not right. And if there's nothing I could do about it, I wish we had more men in the in Congress. We're s with like sitting here. I I'd take a trip up there and find out about it, but we I I'm afraid it wouldn't uh work now. But I think that there's they're certainly being uh uh treated wrong. They certainly be treated wrong. And after all, this is their country. And we just came right in and pushed them out. And the reason we come in and push them out is because they were disunified. One group in fighting that among one another. And right now, listen, we're we're reaping what we sowed. We're getting disunified. See, stir up. All right. It may take it a long time, but it it comes home. Don't you ever worry. Don't you never worry. It comes home. We reap what we sow. He said, "We came out." He said, "The Indians were so what was it? Was it uh uh I think and and brother Daryl Ward, he tells it about Geronimo when there's only a few of them left." And and one of them Indians said to the other Indian, "They were two different tribe, but he said, "I hate you. I hate you." And Geronimo said, "Don't never do that. There's too few of us. What about us as a bride of Christ? We shouldn't hate one another. We should love one another. Though we may differ some ways on different ideas or different what you know it's it just the same thing. If I go to the store and I say I want my uh uh uh groceries put in a bag and you come and say they I want mine put in a sack. It's the same thing. Why dysfellowship over whether it's a I said a sack and you said a bag. It's the same thing. &gt;&gt; But we get so disunified. Brother said that's what that was Indians. He said but don't worry it'll come back on us. He said, "We're getting so disunified." And if you read, if you look at history, it always repeats itself. And look at it now. We're so divided &gt;&gt; as a nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to fall. &gt;&gt; Hey, I believe it's just about over with. And I want to be unified. &gt;&gt; Not only with him, but I want to be unifi. I want to love everybody. You say, "Well, this brother's got some." I want to pray for him. And I hope he does me the same way. Oh my. I was thinking and I was sharing it with brother. He he said he didn't see it, but after Trump became president, I like Trump as as a I think he's a good president, but he sure got a foul mouth. &gt;&gt; But let me say this in saying that, and I ain't trying to get on politics and stuff, and I know when you go to work, if you you working around, they said two things you don't want to talk about at work, it'll get you killed. That's politics and religion. &gt;&gt; Said you don't want to talk about them at work. That'll get you killed. But then when Trump got voted in a few months, there hadn't been a a guy and I forget, I think he might have been a Catholic, but he was an archbishop. He stood up. He handed and they called Trump up there. They handed him a cross. And that archbishop said that Trump reminded him of Constantine. And if you look what brother Brim said about Constantine, Constantine he said, was never a Christian. &gt;&gt; So the only thing he ever did maybe was religious was paint a cross on a church. But what Constantine did, he brought church and state together. &gt;&gt; Now look at it where we're living at. I I tell you what, every just about every religion loves Trump. &gt;&gt; I wonder if he's I don't know. I ain't saying he's the one, but I tell you what, brothers and sisters, we're close. We're very close. I want to be ready to go. Don't you? Brother Bram said in the scripture says, "Behold, how great and how pleasant it is." How great and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. The scripture even said that. How pleasant and how great it is for brethren to dwell in unity. &gt;&gt; To dwell in unity, to fellowship with one another, to love one another. You remember brother Bosworth came to brother Brownman and said, "Brother Brown, you know what fellowship is?" He said, "Well, I think so." I He said, "I'll tell you what it is." He said, "It's two men in one boat, one ship, going in the same direction." Ah, brothers and sisters, I want to be in one ship. I want to be in the same ship you are. That ship of Zion going in the same direction. Hallelujah. Now listen, and I looked up this. I thought it was real good about unity. What's it do for a church? It makes the church a positive example to the world and helps draw others to us. If we're all in one mind and one accord, look at them in the upper room in one mind and one accord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I said it makes the church a positive example. Hey, sure. We're all different. That's what makes the world go around. How would you all like to be the same? Let me ask you a question. How would you all like to be like brother David Wade back there? But we all we're all different. God made us some short ones, some tall ones, some heavy ones, some skinny ones, some with hair, some with no hair. &gt;&gt; Hey, but it's God's bouquet. He made yellow, black, and white. They're all precious in his sight. &gt;&gt; So, we need to stick together. It makes it said it makes the church a positive example to the world and helps draw others to us. Number two, it's that it helps us cooperate as a body of believers. If we're in unity, like I said, unity, our covenant with one another, it helps us cooperate as a body of believers as God minus to. He min to cooperate as a body of believers, &gt;&gt; giving us a foretaste of heaven. Hallelujah. I don't believe there's going to be one over in one corner, one other. They didn't believe it the way we did. They Oh, they're over there. No, they ain't going to be no clicks in heaven. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for that. Amen. Ain't you know what, brother Bradom said? If somebody draws a circle and draws me out of it, I'll just draw a bigger circle and draw them back into it. Hey, I want to be like that. Amen. And number three, it said not only it helps not only does it make the church a positive example, it helps incorporate us as a body, but it renews and revalletizes the ministry because there is less tension to sap our energy. I thought that's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it it renews and revitalizes the ministry because there is less tension to sap our energy. I thought that's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandon said it like this. 1947 deity of Christ. See, if there ever was a time that Christians need one another, it's right now. So, we need you. I can't say like the scripture says I can't say it and says we're all part of that body. How we how we get into that body by one spirit. We're all baptized in that one body and my our body was a eye. Where would the hands be? Where would the hearing be? &gt;&gt; One can't say because I ain't a foot I ain't going to be no part of the body. But I every part has its place. You have your place tonight. What if it was just all brother uh all minister brother Brad and them wouldn't have nobody to preach to. But you as a congregation as lady, they got a body to preach to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We all can't be song leaders. &gt;&gt; We all can't be uh uh worship leaders. We all can't be deacons. We all can't be trustees. But what we can be, we can be unified, praying for one another, and praying. Say, "God, I I Brother Brad, brother uh uh uh Tom, they don't have no way of knowing what I have need of. Brother David, he comes this weekend. He don't have no way of knowing what I have need of, but God, you do." &gt;&gt; And if you can speak to him, to speak to me through me by your word, God, then I'll be satisfied. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been a lot of places and I didn't know what was going on. And I'm glad to God that I didn't. But somebody come to me after service said, "Oh, brother David, you never know what you said. That was meant just for me." Or, "Brother De, even the pastor say, "Brother David, you don't know what's been going on around here." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he did. &gt;&gt; But he did. &gt;&gt; And he said, "We need one another." &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be a help. Like I said this morning, I don't want to be a hindrance. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 13:11 says like this. Finally, brethren, farewell, be perfect. Be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you. My what what big words to obey. Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect. And we can only be perfect in him. Ain't another ain't one of us in here perfect tonight without him or being in him. We all got flaws. We all have been road down roads of disappointments. We'll disappoint one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Tomma disappoint you. Brother Brad disappoints you. &gt;&gt; I'll disappoint you. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother David, have you ever been disappointed by Brother Homer?" Yes. I'll be honest. &gt;&gt; I'm sure if you're honest tonight, you've been disappointed by Brother Tom. &gt;&gt; Let's be honest. But we got to love one another. Pray for your p. Brother said, "Pray for your pastor." &gt;&gt; Amen. Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect. Be of good comfort. Be of one mind. Live in peace. Scripture says, "Blessed are the peacemakers." Said, "Live in peace and the God of love and peace shall be with you." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I like that. Rebraham said that's how in demonology 1953 he said how the all the denomin every one of them and they can't get along with one another &gt;&gt; and we be just then and let's just put us over in the same boat sometimes we can't get along with it's a shame &gt;&gt; sure we may disagree sure we may disagree with one another you say well what about this what about Jeffersonville what about Jeffersonville. I pray for brother Joseph. I pray for Hey, hey, brother Brennan was here. He asked you said, he said, "If any credit goes to my family, it's my wife." He said, "If you're going to do anything, pray for my family." Didn't I say that? &gt;&gt; Well, what about you? &gt;&gt; When you want somebody to pray for you, when you want somebody to pray for your family, that's me. That's brother Top. That's everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. good preacher, &gt;&gt; but we get also been out of shape. Brother said one and that's how denominations got started cuz somebody seen it a little different, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And maybe it wasn't nothing that would put us in a out of a rapture, but we just seen it a little bit different and we get all been out of shape because this one brother says this and this one brother, well, if you believe the way I do, I'll have you on my platform. if I you or whatever. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, we go different and I ain't trying and just like that. But unity, our covenant with one another. You go to different places and people want to ask you say, "Well, who you preach for?" I'm going to get to some just just be tight. Just hold still. Brother said like this demonology 1953. Some believe he's coming on a white horse. Some believes he's coming on a white cloud. And then churches begin to build on that. Cuz this one believes he's coming on white horse. This one believe he's coming on a white cloud. Brother Brown said, "What difference does it make as long as he comes?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Break up and separate call." And you remember when brother Brown preached church order and he said it and and there was a brother that disagreed and he and and they started call brother said don't do that. He said, "That's how this brother believes that. That's his problem. That he'll have to deal with that." &gt;&gt; Did he not say that? You can get it on tape. He said that. I ain't gonna call the brother's name. You can get it on tape, but hey, he said that. &gt;&gt; But he he said, "But don't call them that." &gt;&gt; Said, "Love him." He said, "That's what they want to do." &gt;&gt; He said, "But that's how and you we get in and and and we break up and separate, call one another buzzard and all that. Listen what he said. Your heart's not right with God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Your heart not right with God. Now I'm s I just turned 65 born in 1960 and I grew up during a little bit of maybe was back back then. I lived down in the south Louisiana segregation &gt;&gt; still bad. I mean, from Alabama, still kind of bad, you know, civil rights and all that. Hey, it's still kind of, you know, Martin Luther or Martin Luther King and all that. I said, sometimes it's it's still bad. And you got to even today, you got to watch what you say. Watch what you do. And and and not trying to get nothing wrong, but sometimes we want to stereotype people. Well, they did that because they're that culture. They are that race. Come on. We've been stereotyped and and and the brother Ram said the natural types are spiritual and sometimes we ain't careful. It bleeds over there and we want to stereotype people &gt;&gt; and we we say well he he he preaches for him because he believe it the way he does or whatever. Hey, I'm just evangelist. Hey, I I I just can go anywhere I want to if if I feel led to. And if a person he said, "Well, that brother over there, he believes in 15 gods. You going to go preach for him?" If he invites me, I'll go preach for him. I ain't go there perhaps to help the brother. Maybe maybe he or but I'm he invited me to help his congregation. And that's what I want to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I can say one word that helped somebody, maybe a way where a a person that's out of the fold can bring them back in the fold. I want to be uh willing to help them. &gt;&gt; He said, "But our heart's not right with God." He said, "We are brothers. We must stick by one another. We need one another." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But too many times we I remember one time when Jimmy Swagger done what he done. Now whether he did that, what I don't know. You know how it is sometimes, especially these days, got fake news. There's only something that's real true and that's the report I believe &gt;&gt; and that's this. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know we got so much of this and that, but after Jimmy Swagger did what he did, I remember this guy I was working with and he was of Hispanic descent. He came around the corner. We was fixing to go into the cafeteria, you know, get something to eat. He came around the corner. He go cried, "I've sinned. I've sinned." Like, you know how Jimmy Swagger, I didn't see it, but that's how they portrayed him. You know how he was doing on television said, "I said, look at you. All you preachers are just the same." I said, "You know what? Yesterday I was reading, and this was true. This is what I told him, and this happened for real. I said, "Yesterday, I was reading in a paper where this woman got molested and it was a Hispanic guy that did it." I said, "All you Hispanics are alike." He said, "Oh, oh, wait a minute. Wait." I said, "See, all of us preachers ain't alike." I said, "There's some true ones and and there's some there's some bad ones." &gt;&gt; Amen. I said, "But hey, uh, but we got to stick together. We got to love one another. We got to pray for one another. There's a book that somebody told me about and so I went to the bookstore and they didn't have it, the religious bookstore back home. So I ordered it and they got several different series of it. This one is called The Light and the Glory. Now I'm reading on it cuz I always like to read. Sometimes it's kind of hard to since you get married and stuff, you know, sometimes you got different obligations around the house. But when I was little, wasn't before I got married, my my kids like to read. My my my my my my my grandkids like to read. My grandson, my oldest grandson, he's 16 years old, and my daughter homeschooled him. She taught him how to read when he was four years old, could pick up that Bible and read just just as good as I can. Maybe better. In fact, he loves to read. He told me he told me the other day, I forget when this happened, but he said, "Paulpa, you know what?" He I because how many ever read the Fox book of mortars? I mean one two ain't many. I mean it's a hard I've never read it myself. I looked it's hard book. &gt;&gt; You know what my grandson told me? 16 years old. He said papa the other day I was kind of and I this could have been last two years ago. I don't know but he said papa I was kind of bored around the house. He works at Chick-fil-A when he don't have school or nothing but he said I'm kind of was kind of bored around the house. I said well what did you do? He said, "I picked up that Fox book of mortars and I read it all the way through." &gt;&gt; I said, "Really? That shocked me. I hadn't even read it." And he said, "Paulpaw, I can tell you a little bit about it." He said, "But some of the stuff I won't tell you cuz it's gory." He said, "But there's a couple emperors." He said, "One emperor," and I forgot the name of him, said he was really bad. I mean, he could he could read that. He's that good. He's that smart. But I got this book called The Light and the Glory. And it began to tell about how America got founded. And I didn't really know this, but Columbus, he had several failures. And I think it was clean Queen Elizabeth didn't even want to support him. But finally, he got her to support him and everything. And my it just and many tempted failures coming across here to find a new that they call it the promised land. and and and to find the this new land and my and and and and many attempts and many failures. And then when they started getting over here and coming back, many discouragements, many people turned back. There was people that died, but hundreds people that died coming over here to get away for from bondage and come over here for religious purposes, for religious freedom. I I I didn't know that actually. I I though I like studying history, but I didn't know that it had come that that far and all that and how when they finally got there and there were several people, the Puritans, how they got started and the Quakers and the Puritans were supposed to be real pure, but I think the Quakers were more pure and more holy than the Puritans. And even going to sleep in church, let me tell you this. They would put a feather if a sister would go to sleep or a lady would go to sleep, they stick a feather under her nose and tickle her nose, had big old long stick. And if a man or something they had a little stick and would real long and had a little like a little uh uh uh nail or something would like a a beasting that'll keep you awake. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't want to go to sleep. But in this all this they begin to tell how they was unified when they first came over. You know you see what brother said. We drove off the American native and all that but they were so unified then said begin to low. He said, "We're so divided, especially when it became the Vietnam War and all that. A war that should never been fought. A war that went too long and some of our veterans that came back after that war, we treated them awful." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank God for some of y'all who I don't know who here maybe been in the army but wasn't fought in the war or did that. Hey, thank God for you. That's why we can stand here tonight and preach the dictates of our heart because of men like you that went and fought for our freedom. &gt;&gt; But he said we're so divided. Now listen, and this is a quote out of this book. He said, "We love God and we're covenant to obey him or else we wouldn't be trying to serve him. But we're not living out our covenant with one another." The scripture says, "Love the Lord with all your heart and your neighbor as yourself." The two steps of faith in the Christian walk. The second step is a way in a way requires more faith because you must learn to trust a perfect God operating in and through imperfect vessels. Brother Bram said, "God has a lot to deal with when it comes to another human being trusting another human being." &gt;&gt; So sometimes people has played us false, lied to us, and it's sometimes kind of hard to trust another human being, &gt;&gt; another mortal. He said, "We must do this armed only with the assurance that it is God's will that the other vessels hearts are also turned towards his will and that they too are aware of their being called to serve him together." I like this. The second step also calls one to yield to their local part of the body of Christ and to dedicate oneself to that congregation and its work. I like that. You're called to a certain body. You're to dedicate yourself to that body &gt;&gt; and that local congregation and its work. Listen, God permits pressures to befall the body of Christ to increase in commitment to one another as well as commitment to God. I tell you what, since I've been going through my illness, like I said, God touched me, but it's made myself commit to him a little bit more. Not that I was afraid to die or anything, but hey, there's things, brother David. Hey, there's things that ain't don't mean as much as I used to mean. &gt;&gt; But there's things that matters a whole lot more. And that my walk with him &gt;&gt; is perfect. He said he he permits pressures. Brother Bram said he allows the church to go through tension. said tension was good for a church. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you don't understand it, but he said it was. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying what he said. &gt;&gt; He said, "God permits pressures to be part of the body of Christ to increase in a commitment to one another as well as a commitment to God. A house divided against itself shall not stand." You cannot be a family centered in Christ without being committed to some body of fellow Christians to belong to. Then brother Brown teach us that huh we're find us a church home where we can support it with our tithes and our offerings. &gt;&gt; Said you cannot be a body committed to some body of fellow Christians. He said to belong to Christ is to belong to one another. You need one another in order to fulfill Christ's order. Independence is a nightmare because God did not intend man to live alone. God does his work of his work of maturing Christians primarily through other Christians. The process of maturing cannot be accomplished alone. A independent person will do whatever it is right. Whatever is right in their own eyes as judge judges say independence from the body means run. I thought my that was good. That was real good. We got to be committed to one another. committed to a local body. Let me say like this. God, brother Ram said, sometimes it's me using my faith to help somebody. And sometimes we got to use what we can to help. Maybe not only our faith, but maybe our our our our mental or our physical being to help somebody else. &gt;&gt; There was four lepers one or four men one time carrying a lame man. And I knew there was a song about it. Let me Can I just read it to you? I I ain't going to try to hold you too long, but I thought, my this is this was real good. I ain't going to tell you the name of it, but you might have heard it before if you have discounted my ignorance. One day, four men brought it. And sometimes we got to help one another. See, these four men that were carrying this one lame man on a pallet, they couldn't get that lame man couldn't carry himself to Jesus. So what they did, they helped them. Sometimes some of us we might not can get to Jesus by oursel and we can help one another. &gt;&gt; One day four men brought a man to Jesus. Still and lifeless he lay upon his bed. He had not moved since he was just a baby. Still he forgot to be still he longed to become a normal man. Now, we don't know much much about the men that carried the corners of his tattered bed that day. But if we may create an illustration, we'll see what these men might have said. Suppose the first man said, "I hate to doubt it, for Jesus touched my eyes when I was blind. He made me see, and there's no doubt about it, but this man's needs are much more serious than mine." Sometimes we feel like that but we can still help one another. Suppose this second man said we no need to bother this man's condition will remain the same though Jesus touched my hand when it was withered I don't believe he can he heal a man so lame suppose that third man said I hate to question but no one here is more skeptical than me though Jesus ch cleansed me when I was a leper this helpless man will never walk you see then every eye was turned turned to see that fourth man to see how he might criticize and doubt. But all three men were startled with amazement when that fourth man stepped out and said his name out loud. He said, "My name is Lazarus." &gt;&gt; Could I testify? My name is Lazarus. It feel good. It feels good to be alive. When I'm when I was when I in chains of death was bound, this man named Jesus called me out. If you think that your little problem is too big for him to solve, take it from the one who's heard from the mighty voice of God. A living testimony of his death touch. My name is Lazarus. Oh, I wanted to shout back there. Amen. But I got to hold still. Amen. My name is Lazarus. Amen. And sometimes we can help somebody. Maybe just testifying to somebody and telling somebody what Jesus did for us. Amen. There been four men when this man on this bed probably didn't have faith enough to get to Jesus. But them four men had enough faith that they could take his bed and they had to tear the roof off the ceiling to get him into see where Jesus was. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; What about Caleb and her? You remember what happened to him two guys? They set Moses on a rock because when Moses had his hand lifted up, Israel was progressing in the war. Well, when Moses's hands dropped, they begin to lose the battle. So, you know what they did? Caleb and her went up there, set Moses down on the rock, and held up his hands. &gt;&gt; Maybe when brother Tom, your pastor, is going through a battle, my pastor, whoever it may be, and and he he needs your help, maybe you can go and help him. Set him on a rock and hold his hands up. Hallelujah. We need one another. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ah, we need to segregate ourselves from the things of the world, but still holding to God's truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love them. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Oh, I love him with all my heart. Amen. Oh, I appreciate him with all my heart. Let me read you another little thing that Brother Bram said. A thanking man's filter. He said, "We want to grow closer and closer together. We must be one body. We must move together, forgetting one another's sins and our differences, just sticking closer and closer as we see that day approaching, assembling ourselves together with a one accord and one heart. And if one our brother, our sister gets out of the way, don't do nothing but pray for that person." and in love, always considering one another. Don't never let one of you get away. Stay together and if you can add more to it constantly all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, let's just look at this. There's four things and I'll get to it and then we'll close. That be all right. What about our covenant with one another? Mark 12 29-31 it says and Jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is here O Israel the Lord our God is one Lord so the first command first of all the commandments is here Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thus and he said and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. The main principle was the Lord our God is one God or one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord out of and with your whole heart. &gt;&gt; And with all thy mind out of and with all your mind, your soul, your your your your your heart, your life, everything. And with all thy strength, with all with with and all your strength, all your all your mind, all your faculty of thought and your understanding, and with all your strength, everything with all your soul, life out of it, and with all your mind, faculty, thought, understanding, with all your strength, everything, just give it to God. That was the first one. That's our covenant with one another. Amen. He said, "And the second is like, namely this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Leviticus 18:19, I think it is, says it like this. Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. I am the Lord. How many always How many has had somebody done something wrong to you in the church or sometimes you just can't wait to get out? Said, "I'll wait till I get out of here. I'll give them a piece of my mind. I'll tell you what. Oh, I got some quotes together and I'll show them what &gt;&gt; help me, Lord." &gt;&gt; And maybe they got some quotes together that they can show me where I'm wrong. That's right. &gt;&gt; The second is like, namely this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. Help us Lord. &gt;&gt; His laws is not burdensome. Two simple principles. Love God and love others. Love God completely. everything, all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, with all your strength, and care for others as you care for yourself. Come on. Asked her, that lady sitting right there with that white hair right there, that one right there, Mrs. Gadman, she said, "David, you going to have to cut this out since you got out of the hospital. You just been a baby. Do this and do this and do that. Hey. &gt;&gt; Hey. Men are babies. Come on. Let's be honest. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes. Hey, we like to be babyed. Might as well be honest. We like to be babyed, you know. Hey, my wife's just like Sarah. Sarah called him Lord. Sarah called Abraham Lord. I asked for a glass glass of water. Lord, David, can't you get it yourself? [Applause] Nah, she's good. She She'll kill me after church. I got to ride back home with her. Hallelujah. But that's our covenant with one another. And there in that light of glory said, "We we we forsaken our covenant with one another." He said, "That's why we're so disunified. &gt;&gt; That's why we ain't got the unity that we and he said and brother Bam said it's going to come around. And you know how the old saying bias us. Amen. It's because what we did to the native and look at it and we're so disunified. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the natural and in the spiritual. That's our covenant with one another. What about Christ's order? John 13:34 and:es 34 and 35. This is Christ's order. A new commandment I give unto you. Somebody picked up that book. I was told one time we all got it and I I I must have misplay. I don't know. The 11th commandment. How many seen that brother? I'm just talking about love and all that. Talks about the the the possum and the and the the the hornets and everything. My I heard brother somebody say brother come by and preach for us. Man I read I didn't try I squat them spray. Give me some sprays. Try to spray them old hornets with that hornet spray. Now little hornets. I'm sorry. Go back. No. It's got to be real. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's got to be genuine. Can you imagine, brother said about mowing and he hid that and he said, "I'm sorry. I'm God's servant. I trying to hurry and get in this grass mold and I ran into your nest and bothered you, disturbed you." He really meant it. &gt;&gt; What about that killer bull? &gt;&gt; Said, "I got in your territory. I'm sorry. What about us? &gt;&gt; You know, it's all saying, and maybe Abraham Lincoln said it, I can't remember. You can't fool the people. You might fool them some of the time, but you can't fool them all the time. And you really know when somebody puts their arms around you, you don't have to have a gifted discernment, like brother Bram said, but you can know when somebody puts their arms around your sister, sister, and brother to brother, and they say they really love you, you know whether they're telling the truth or not. You know whether it's coming from the heart or not. Help me Lord. New commandment. They said something about that book. But Jesus said a new commandment. There was ten commandments and he said a new commandment. So that'd be the 11th commandment. He said a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another. He said, "A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another as I have loved you, that you also love one another." How much did he love us? He came took on a sinful form of flesh to be tested like me and you were to go through pain, discomfort, disappointments, so he would know how mean you feel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brothers, sisters, young people, you feel rejected. You feel like nobody cares. He was rejected. &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going through. You feel like nobody love he he didn't feel like nobody loved him. He weeping over weeping over looking overlooking Jerusalem. He said, "How often I would have gathered you like a hing with a brood but you would not. You've been tempted young people, young men. You've been tempted by women. How can overcome?" Brother said, "Jesus was tempted by women. He knows what you're going through." Amen. That's right, &gt;&gt; sisters. You feel like you're on the back burner sometimes. He knows what you're going through. &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going through. To be a faithful high priest, one that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; And he loved us that much. That's right. &gt;&gt; Became one in us. Why can't we love one another? Why can't we pray for one another? He said, "A new commandment that you love one another as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another." My keep showing love among ourselves. Hey, people may come and it don't matter about our they may not understand our doctrine. Big building, what does it matter? They they may not care whether it's a storefront, whether it's a nice church building or what our doctrine, but what about our love toward one another? He said this. Oh, we read it this morning when I about being written epistles read of all men. Like I said, sometimes some people may not read a Bible, but they'll read your life. What about our love toward one another? United living examples. What about being living examples? My I want to be a living example. Don't you? That was our covenant with one another. Christ's order. Number three, unity. St. John 17:es 20 and 21. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them which also believe on me through their word. See, he said, "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word." &gt;&gt; In other words, them preaching and them testifying. I'm praying for those that will hear them preaching and testifying that they'll believe on me through their word. I pray Lord help us Lord God that hey when you go out you brothers on your job I pray God help them that maybe they're testifying or with you sisters in the grocery store or in your house and do your or somebody a neighbor or whatever that maybe you're testifying or just just being you just living your life daily &gt;&gt; that they may whoever you may come in contact with that they'll believe on him through what you have are doing and through your words and through your testimony and by the way you live and conduct your life. Hallelujah. Jesus prayed for us, didn't he? He said, I pray &gt;&gt; for these alone. He said that they shall be one or and then brother said the denomination. They say, "Oh, we just want but they," he said, "not like that, but one with what? One with the word." And who's the word? Christ is the word. And Christ sent us a word in our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not as the pope would have us one, but one with his word. Said, "Neither, I pray them for them, but for those that they all may be one, as thou, Father, art me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me." Oh, is that what you want? &gt;&gt; That the world may believe that. Hey, you have sent me that they can believe on me through your words, through your testifying, through your life. That's number three. Number four, our mandate. Our mandate. Listen what he says before I read this. This is he preached on the message when their eyes were open 1956. See, a lot of people say, "Well," and it it goes back again to like I said, the natural types of spiritual. The medical doctor, he's against the the the the the uh surgeon and the surgeon condemns the chiropractor. And the chiropractor, you know, and all that, brother says medical doctor, he the surgeon, they condemn, you know, the chiropractor, we we need you and he said, "And we need one another. We need every one of them. Where one can't help you, another one may can." Hey, we need us in the in the body of Christ. We need the pastor. We need the teacher. We need the prophet. We need we need all these. We need the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Number four, our mandate. And I didn't really know what mandate means, but every now and then they say, you know, like at work, you brothers at work, they get we give you a mandate or we we we're going to mandate this or this is a mandate. And a mandate means an official order or commission. In other words, it's official. This is an official order or a commission to do something. I mean, they wrote it down. It's a mandate. You got to do it. Give someone author or give someone authority to act in a certain way. This is our mandate. It's an order. We've been given it by the supreme being himself, Jesus Christ. We've been given a mandate an official order and that official order is Ephesians 4 verse three endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Each and every one of us has been given a mandate this afternoon and that's endeavor. In other words, it means be eager and strive constantly to guard and keep the harmony. What about that? To guard, to strive, to be eager, to keep the harmony. Willing to be led. Willing to be led. Sometimes we ain't willing to be led by the Holy Spirit, but I want to be willing to be led. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Willing to be led and do our part. I want to do my part. &gt;&gt; If it's just coming to church 30 minutes early, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Sitting quietly, &gt;&gt; reading my Bible, &gt;&gt; and praying. Say, Lord, you know, Brother Homer, he don't know what I have need of. He don't know what I've been going through this week and whatever you have for me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Can he do that, Brother David?" &gt;&gt; You want a testimony? Me and my wife were sitting. We sat right there on the second bench or second pew. We ain't got pews now. We got chairs. But we sitting there in our church. I don't know if anybody's ever been to our church. I don't know if you have, brother. We only got two rows of seats, you know, one row and another row. So, been several years ago, my wife was sitting there and she's kind of nervous type. And she leaned over at me and said some things was going on. She said, "David, I'm just so nervous." And she named some things that were bothering her. And she said, "I just feel like getting up and going home." She said, "I ain't going to get nothing out of the service." How many's ever been there? I said, 'Well, we'll just pray. Now, whether I've seen I can't remember whether between services we went and ate with brother Homer. I don't know what, but I did not see him till he walked out there. If we did, that's fine. If not, I'm just saying I didn't see him cuz my wife leaned over and said, "Did you talk to Brother Homer?" Because here's what happened. Brother Homer got up there and I hadn't seen him before he walked out there. He got to preaching under the anointing and he stopped right in the middle and he said, "I don't know why I'm going this direction, but the Lord's leading me to this direction." And he named the things that my wife told me was bothering her. 30 minutes before the service, she told me he comes out and he hits on it. God's mindful of us. [Applause] God's mindful of us. He can do that. Amen. Focus on God, not ourselves. On what God can do as a body of believers. Amen. Brother Tom may not know what you have need of. Brother Brad don't know what you have need of. I may not know what you have need of the other advantage. But if you be praying and asking God and come in here and be as a body of believers in unity and not divided and pray and say, "God, you speak to the brother. Help him. Lord, I need you this morning. I need you tonight. I need you Wednesday, whatever it may be. and brother Tom or whoever it may be may leave their notes and speak to your condition then move on. &gt;&gt; He's God. &gt;&gt; Endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Let me read one more then we'll close. I trust this is all right this morning this afternoon. Listen what he says. We've all heard this one. I like it. Love one another above everything. Love one another. No matter what the devil tries to say. Now, you're all one great big sweet group now. But remember my warning. See, Satan won't let that stay that way. No, sir. He'll shoot everything. If he has to bring somebody in to make his target, he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and set him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things. And then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it. Don't you take sides with it. Don't you have nothing to do with anything else. You stay right, loving, and sweet and kind to one another. Pray for that man that he'll be saved to or that woman orever who it is. Just pray for them and stick one with another. And stay with your pastor. See, he's the shepherd. And you give him respects. You you he'll lead you through. and because he's ordained a god to do so. Now you do remember that the enemy will come &gt;&gt; and when the when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in. Ain't that something? Brother Brham didn't pull no punches. We all know this. It's called the word to the church. He said he either get in or we'll either get out or some or come in and be one of you. That's all. Don't never clan among one or or talk. Make yourself clanish. We we are one. I couldn't let left hand. I'm I'm mad at you. I'm going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand. He's at He's my left hand. I want him to stay there. Even the little tip of my finger. I want to stay right there. Every little part of my body stay right there. And God wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another. Right at uh right at with one another. And now you got tapes on that. You got tapes on what we believe. You got tapes on discipline in the church. How we behave ourselves in the church of God. How we got to come in together and set together in heavenly places. Don't stay home. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers. If you don't don't feel that way, then I'll tell you, it's time you get to praying because we're in the last days where the Bible exalted or exhorted us to to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and to and divine love. No, to to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places and and with with Christ Jesus and love one another. This will be this will all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for the other. That's right. Stay right together. If the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister, say, "Lord, don't let that uh never uh have that root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it take the Christ right out of my life. That poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you. It'll run him from the tabernacle here. It'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from there, hurt your pastor. It'll do everything. See, don't you do that. You just wax that much closer together. Draw take the buckle. As a brother testified, a minister here the other night about having a buckle. Send it and vision just that buckles on the whole armor of God. Just put her on, tighten up, move right up close to one another, love one another. Anyhow, talk nice about one another. Say nice things about one another. and then God will bless you. How many wants to be blessed? He said, "Talk nice about one another, say nice things about one another, pray for one another, and then God will bless you." I want to be blessed by God. Don't you? Let's stand together tonight. Hallelujah. You love him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give him praise in the house. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. I trust this was all right tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I love him with all my heart. I appreciate him. Amen. Just I thought my just our unity, our covenant with one another. We failed so miserably, hadn't we? But if God will be merciful to us, he'll help us, won't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we love you with all that's within our hearts. Lord, we appreciate you, Father. And Lord, if I said anything out of the way, forgive me, Lord. Didn't mean to. Just help me, Father. Brother Tom, thanks. send anything out of the way, he'll call me, let me know, Father. But Lord, I just felt this on my heart, Lord. Unity, our covenant with one another, Lord, how in the natural how that them guys and they took great detail in writing that book. They they searched it out all over, Lord, and talking about how America came to be and all that, Lord, and how they went through all the battles and scars they went through to get to where they were. And then all of a sudden to realize, Lord, that we've we've let down our covenant with one another. how we're so divided. Father, Lord, in the natural types, the spiritual, Father, God, help us, Lord. Help us to pray for one another like your prophet said, to love one another, to help one another, Lord Jesus. Pray for our pastor, Lord, and help him, Lord God. And Lord, you see both of them being sick to today. Lord, I pray, Lord, you'd touch Brother Brad again. Touch Brother Tom, Lord, everyone that wouldn't be here for some other reason. Lord, maybe those that were here this morning, had to leave or Lord, they had to drive back somewhere, Lord. God, I pray, Lord, you just continue to touch and bless. Lord God, help each and every one just drive us much closer to you, Lord. God, help us to keep our covenant that we made one a unity. Lord, a unified body, Lord. Father, oh, we may have some differences, no doubt, Lord. We may not see everything eye to eye, no doubt, Father, but Lord, may we love one another. May we pray for one another, Lord. May we just draw that much closer together, Lord. Father, we're living in a late hour. Time's running out, Father. Lord, there's some of us here sitting here, standing here tonight, Lord, that may have loved ones that are lost and without you, Lord. Father, we can't love one another. How do we expect them to love one another? If we can't hold together, how do we expect them to come in, Lord? But I pray for everyone that maybe have someone like that, Lord. May we all stand together, Lord, and we just sent out the Holy Ghost tonight. Lord, your prophet said we had a right to take your agent, God's Holy Spirit, and send it out there to wherever they may be. Maybe you robbed some of our young people. They're they're they're outside the fold tonight. Lord, maybe some of these moms, these dads have been praying for Wayward Boy, Wayward Girl. Lord, I pray Lord you go to where they're at tonight, Lord, by your Holy Spirit, Lord, and arrest their souls. May they realize, Lord, that there's more to life than what they're doing. Father, &gt;&gt; maybe the Satan has robbed the health of some of us, our loved ones. I pray, Lord, you go, we have a right. Your prophet said we sent out the Holy Spirit to where they're at tonight. Ask you to raise them back up, touch them, Lord. May you heal their bodies, Lord. Lord, I'm a recipient of your healing power, Lord. Father, and I pray for those that are without tonight that may be sick, Lord. Maybe the doctors gave up on Lord, but Lord, you're still a healer. Maybe Lord, Satan has bound some people where they can't even worship you, right? Lord, they can't even come to church and raise their hands. Lord, we send out the Holy Spirit tonight. Lord, Lord, help them. Set them free tonight, Lord, by your power, Lord Jesus. Grant it, Lord, that we can lift our holy hands to you, Lord, to worship you in spirit and in truth. Grant it, Father. We love you. May we love one another. That's our covenant, Lord. This we all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one for the other. Grant it, Father. We ask these things in the lovely name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Brother, whatever you got there. Amen. [Music] want to live the way he &gt;&gt; he wants. Oh, do you tonight? &gt;&gt; Do you want to live that way? &gt;&gt; Why don't you just raise your hands to him and say, "Lord, I want to live the way you want me to live tonight." Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to love [Music] till there's just no more love. For I could never ever love. I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give to love to love. Bless the David. No more love for I could never ever round out love the Lord. Oh, I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love love till there's just no more love for I could never ever love the Lord [Music] and shut in with God in the secret place. shut in with God in a secret place. There in the spirit beholding his face, gaining new power to run in the race. Oh, I long to be shut in with God. Oh, shut in with God in a secret place. There in the spirit beholding his face, gaining new power to run in the race alone to be shut in with God. Amen. Are we blessed by the word today? Amen.
