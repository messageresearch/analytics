kind heavenly father we come before your throne of grace now lord jesus approaching your word and father we just ask lord as we look into your word father and search our hearts come before you presenting yourselves to you see where we're at with you father and what you would have for us this morning what you want to say to us lord we just give you the liberty to speak through us lord jesus and be in the ears of the each here lord to be able to receive father something from you that you have for us knowing god that you are in the form of your spirit in your church god living out your life and completing your work father through us we ask lord jesus that you just be in every portion of the service we thank you for each one that has come out lord to hear you word that loves and cares about you more than anything else lord jesus in the world and free father we just pray lord that you'll bless the meditation of our heart that which we feel like you've laid upon a heart to speak on this morning lord bless your word as we open it now and anoint us in jesus christ's name amen and amen praise the lord god is good isn't he amen turn your bibles if you will to the book of galatians the book of galatians we want to speak this morning on the teacher the teacher amen how many believes that we need a teacher amen let's read chapter 3 and we'll begin with verse 24. wherefore the law was our school master to bring us to christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith come we are no longer under a schoolmaster for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus and if you be christ then ye are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise now notice he was talking about the law bringing us being a school master to bring us to christ now in the next chapter chapter 4 he talks about if we are an heir notice if you be abraham's seed then ye are heirs according to the promise now understand here what he says about the error all right now i say paul says that the heir as long as he is a child right amen difference nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father amen may god that is blessing to the reading of the words you can be seated and then before i start my lesson this morning i want to talk to you about just a couple prophecies that brother branham made some prophecies and the different things that he said uh but you know and and we also of course understand no and and you know even my wife was talking a little bit about about it this morning and she was saying how she's so thankful to be an american and have the liberty and the freedom that we have amen and i says yes we do enjoy it but we do know that these liberties and things will be taken from us he knows that and so and it's happening it's really happening these prophecies and things that the bible talked about amen will be taken away and i told her i said you know even to where you know even to where you won't be able to buy or sell unless you belong to the organization amen and and so forth or the system so to speak amen and so i want to just to read a couple of these here just to kind of get us on our toes because as a minister as a as a pastor of course we as christians as they all we need to watch the signs of the times don't we we need to see what's happening around us and what's going on you know and i want to just say that i think one of the latest things that uh you know we talk about government overreach and things like that you know to make it mandatory and and and i believe it was biden that said you know that he made it mandatory that any uh job people that have jobs and so forth any uh business i believe it is that has like over a hundred employees that they have to make it mandatory right that they have to make it mandatory that uh that they get vaccinated you know and that's just that's all that is is a little feeler right because you know that it's not gonna stop at a hundred huh next time it'll be anybody that has five or two it'll be everybody right i mean you know it's just putting those fillers out if you can get away with that then you know look at what what's coming next right and so we already know that there's maybe i hope hopefully nobody here but people actually losing their livelihood right and it's affecting your pocketbook unless you do what is not you know not valid some of the and this is the thing of it we know that we have a a law we have there's a lot of laws that we don't even know know about that are passed that i'm going to read to you about that the prophet knew about that had already been that have already been passed and you you don't realize that we don't realize a lot of times when uh perhaps even with this what do they call this new uh this um loan they're getting for 3.5 million that they want to do a reconciliation or whatever you know and it's a 29 paid 2 900 page law that they're putting into fact what's all in that 2900 pages that's a lot of pages right and so but that's been going on for many years you know right and in those pages and all those things uh you know they put things to where uh you don't even know the laws that there and i'm going to read you a couple that'll be shocking to you that the prophet knew about but like i told my wife it says you know it'll come down to where you know you won't be able to buy or sell unless you belong and i you know to me it just puts my uh my um be ready my b be aware up because perhaps it'll be a lot smoother than what we think right it'll be more slick the mark of the beast and things will be a lot more slick than what you anticipate you know and so it'll be it'll be you know it'll definitely be smooth it'll it won't be something that'll look like the muck of the beast but unless you know and unless you're aware of it you'll know not to you people will partake of it folks i'm here to tell you when it comes to livelihood people are probably going to take them shots it's my livelihood i'll take the shot and it's probably nothing wrong with it you know i'm going to put i'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit of ease you know because we know trump tries to take the the the credit for this pizza or whatever vaccine that they come up with you know so you know because you know you don't want to take something from somebody you don't trust and that's why we're so leery of it right but anyway but that's just a vaccine but you know what if it goes in numb we know that it'll go into something else other than just a vaccine you know and i i love the joke somebody said about you know he says we gotta protect ourselves from the unvaccinated somebody said well isn't that what the shot's supposed to do yeah i thought that was pretty good you know yeah you get vaccinated that's supposed to take care of it no no no we gotta protect yourself from that hell but anyway so but i'm just saying that look at that look at how it's coming in amen now let's know what the prophet of god says now the jews united themselves against jesus and against his messiahship and his messiah message and we see the same thing happening now the same thing communism is uniting to destroy the church how many knows that this is this far left move is communism 100 that's right and one thing they hate is christianity anything with christianity they hate it anybody you know and the only way that this is after the church has united itself to the world council of churches the world council of churches to deny and to destroy the message all right they have turned down the word how many knows the church world has absolutely turned jesus christ away it didn't matter how many signs how much discernment i know how much that jesus christ could let me just say this the fullness of jesus christ came back into the church in your age and my age through the prophet of malachi 4. what i mean by that is jesus come back and he dis like he did with the woman at the well you've had five husbands in the one you're living with now it's not yours and so on and so on she says well we know when the messiah comes he'll do these things and he said i am he and she ran into the city and convinced the whole city that he was the messiah because of this testimony well jesus has come the very same way because remember he said when the holy ghost comes and does the things and you speak against that it won't be forgiving in this world of the world to come amen so we know that the holy spirit has come again in the church in the preachers in the prophets and he has come in a more fuller way than john wesley or martin luther or those reforms but he come in form and for seven times around the world this deserves and these miracles and this infallible proof that jesus was alive and that it was him and that right and yet in all of that the churches were too blind to see it to recognize that it's not brother branham it's not a prophet it's not my life it's jesus christ in the church doing the very same works that he did when he was here on earth amen [Music] and so you know and and the church world turned him turned christ down i mean he knows that so they now notice they have turned down the word the churches have they cannot accept it because it's against their denominational creed this is true if they played message state it would condemn their very church because they teach things that's contrary to the bible that's what it condemns teaching for doctrines the commandments of men right and so they can't accept it they didn't accept it and because it didn't come their way the way they thought it should come they turned it out amen because of that jesus christ has spewed him out of their mouth it means he's not in there anymore now they cannot accept it because it's against the denominational crete no matter how many pillars of fire hello no matter how many pillars of fire the fbi went investigated this year at the head of the fbi and they seen if it was any double exposure or anything he says no that was they declared it was the only supernatural light that's ever been photographed they even they verified that pillar fire the fbi did and no matter how many pillars of fire would hang in the midst of the people or how many people would be how many uh things would be foretold to happen and all the great signs that he promised of the last day they cannot do it therefore they are uniting themselves now and your pastor here and many of them you can tell them to can tell you this reading that they have an ecumenical movement of the world there's a lutheran minute lutheran minister over and if there comes a disaster what happened in this neighborhood here and he was talking about this is in paperwork now already this is already in law because we know that we have a little common law and then we have a a law that is under a what is a disaster right emergency if if a state declares a state of emergency we go into a different mode we've already experienced that isn't that right people can just pretty much make their own law amen and just the supreme court just got finished upholding some of those things that people have made hello so it goes to show you now notice so he says in this neighborhood if there was a disaster if we are not united with that ecumenical move then our church can no more be church and they can use it for a storeroom or if one of the brothers would be somebody would be dying or hurt and try to minister it to him any spiritual blessing we could be shot for it exactly right we can be given 10 years in federal prison for ministering anything because we're not a member of that ecumenical move how many knows this woke thing it's something that's woke up already because you know if you don't agree with them well they just rather you died you just rather have you dead they have no mercy for you whatsoever right so you look at that now don't you see the mark of the beast there see now another one in just once more shreveport in 1963 he says this jezebel system and we know that's what we got right now blind spiritually to the word of god joining themselves right into the council of churches everything our great evangelical teaching we have to forfeit that to be an organization because all of the organizations that isn't in this council of churches i got the paper on it that even if your church is not in this council of churches in time of trouble they can use your church to store ammunition or anything they want to and if any man is caught praying for anybody outside of affiliation with this council of churches can be shot as a federal offense that's right i got the papers on it in washington see they're going to force it into force you into it and that's why i've been against the organizational system that's right now i've had to keep quiet about it being the mark of the beast but it's too late now it's late enough now until you can know that it's the truth that's exactly right amen so that goes to show you folks where we're heading how many knows we're hidden it's going that way that direction to where they will force force you to do what they want you to do amen but it also goes to show you how late the hour is amen and where we should be amen and how that we have patiently waited for this time we have preached for 30 years here from this public that i've been waiting for these things to happen because these things that's been prophesied these scriptures that are written in the bible this you know because we know one thing is for sure it's going to happen the way this book said it's going to happen you can put that in the bank right because you know that this is not wrong and so when it comes down to where you can't well they won't you know you might not you might not be shocked for just having church but you cross one of their other things they'll shoot you or whatever and they'll certainly play on your pocketbook amen you won't be able to have this that or the other and all of your church you'll just take it away from you if they want to so don't hold on to anything in this world too tight amen so let's get on the subject this morning i felt like just teaching a little bit on the teacher amen and we want to just look a couple scriptures here about this teacher because we see how that here paul is saying that uh you know whenever you get born again when you have experienced a new birth and i'm just uh if i might just put it away let me just read up say it the way the prophet of god said it and i want to first go back and read his quote on what he said about the old testament and how that what this tutor ship come from back in the old testament a father he maybe he owned a great portion of ground on this he had little buildings and in there he had servants amen when his son was born into his family this son as soon as he was born he was a son because he was born a son now this may be a little strange but i trust that you take it and look at it first he says when the pentecostal church and the full gospel people received the holy ghost they said this is it we're born into the kingdom of god and that's all settled but abram says that's in ever amen it's not all settled it's not all done how many knows god begins to work on you there that's when you are a little child you're just starting to grow this morning i want to talk about how sometimes we are so hard on our children i mean as even as teenagers sometimes boy if they're not perfect we'll climb all over them what in the world and all you got to do is look in the mirror a little bit of what you would like it as a teenager and you say whoa me i was a lot worse than that person ever thought of being but yet we're judgmental we tend to be so hard and that right amen and we gotta just realize that hey when we're born again folks that's just the beginning of it all right so he says here that's right he says listen um that is an heir when a son was born into the family that's true he was the son of his birth but this father he was so busy he had so much to do so he looked out through all of the country and he got the best tutor that he could find a man to educate his son and to raise up his son and to make him the right kind of boy or can we say the right kind of girl how typical that is of our heavenly father when his children is born into the kingdom they're not given a bishop huh i'm going to put pastor in there is that right not given some earthly person but god the father has given the best tutor the church could have the holy spirit how many is that this morning to realize that you have on board if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost you have got a teacher you've got your tutor you've got your teacher with you 24 7. so what did your teacher teach you last week huh last month all right let me just say this all right so he gave tutor to church have the holy spirit as a raiser of the church when he comes he will teach you and guide you into all truth the holy spirit now when this when this duty this teacher of raising the son was to bring word to the father again of how that he had progressed his concept determined his inheritance if he was a good son he would inherit all that the father had but he was if not a good son then he wasn't given nothing because he wasn't worthy oh my my goodness now according to the prophet y'all know hear him in different places he taught and the scripture tells us amen that there is a place of adoption we are called to the adoption of children by jesus christ above paul says amen so you know i got to thinking of how that we're learning and learning more and more let me establish first of all that this scripture and what i'm saying is true in saint john i believe it's the 14th chapter jesus said if any man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and he will come unto him and make our abode with him amen he that loveth me not keepeth not my saying now one of the things that we want to teach here is that one of the things that god tries to get us to do one of the things that he teaches us is to be obedient to the word of god you're either an obedient child or you're a disobedient child amen let me tell you something maybe just a little ahead of time here but you would not believe how many bastard children are out there how many disobedient children are out there but notice and he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the father which has sent me these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he will teach amen he will teach you all things and bring things all things to your remembrance how we can stop there and how that we all know that most of the time in a lot of times when we are in dealing with the holy ghost there's so many times that he'll bring things back to our remembrance remember this remember that because we are forgetful people it takes the holy spirit to bring back to our remembrance what god said hear about this what god said about that but you know as many times school children we don't listen to god we don't hear what the teacher is saying amen and i like this because we have an on board teacher teacher that i thinks teaching you things i can't teach you amen amen that only the holy spirit can teach you over in first john 2 and verse 27 but concerning but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things isn't that something other scriptures dovetailed together and is truth and is no lie and even as it has taught you you shall abide in him what does it say it shall lead you and guides you into all truth amen so notice and just because that you have received the holy ghost that doesn't mean that everything's just going to be poured out into your hands that's the reason if the church would just get quiet just a little bit and quit trying to say i'm assembly of god i'm oneness i'm trinitarian i'm this i'm down to the other i mean i know if we just sit quiet if we just be still hold still and learn the holy ghost could teach us something amen how many believes that he could teach us something if we would just learn in first corinthians the third chapter paul said for who has known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ and brethren when i could not speak unto you as spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ i have fed you with milk and not meat wherefore hitherto you were not able to bear neither are ye now able to bear it ye are yet carnal for whereas among you envying in strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men for one saith i am of paul i am apollos are you not carnal amen he says you know i have planted paul is watered but it's god that gives increase in other words there are still divisions i mean let me tell you something as long as there's still divisions in the church body there is still carnality people are still in their diapers still babes when you go to gossiping and running everybody down or this out of the other you aren't grown yet you haven't even learned how to control this right here control your tongue you haven't to learn to control your mind amen praise be to god oh my i got to thinking about this and i got to thinking of how that you know you know that we we we tend to be uh dogmatic many times you know and i've known i'm just going to say i've known i know people in this message you know and i don't want nobody to get the picture of who because i'm not here to preach against anybody but i'm just here to tell you there's people amen that have been in here for close to probably 50 years but when you robbed them the wrong way you robbed that person the wrong way all of a sudden you're you ain't even got the holy ghost you're not saved you're not a believer you're you're you know you're a judas they destroy you can you imagine if a person like that was given the power of the spoken word i wouldn't want to be anywhere close to him would you no amen and so god has to bring us to a certain place and i wonder even the problem said you know the baptist and methodist we ought to be at this place where god can adopt us because how many believe we're going to go into a rapture one of these days joseph the bible says that they're going to not be you're not going to be able to buy or sell so the bible also says we which are alive and remain unto his coming shall not prevent them with your sleep but we will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye in that right we're going to be caught up together to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord oh my the closer that comes to that place that you can't by herself the closer it is to the coming of the lord how he believes that the more the squeeze comes down the more the pressure comes down the closer it is to the coming of the lord it's a road sign telling you we're almost there folks amen if sodom and gomorrah had to get in that condition if the days of noah had to get in that condition such a horrible condition the sons of men saw the daughters of men and man's thoughts were continually evil then it's got to be that way again before he brings the fire down and folks you talk about a fire amen i don't want to be nowhere around when the fire of god begins to fall to you it's going to burn like you ain't never seen amen but how many is glad to be in the house of god where the fire is falling now the fire of the holy spirit is falling today on us what's it doing as same consuming fire which we know god is a consuming fire right that same holy spirit is consuming everything in here that's not supposed to be there are you with me we come to church this morning so that the holy spirit can consume everything that doesn't fit in over there we come to not be children anymore praise be to god but let the teacher teach us amen what if i next sunday wanted you to have a piece of paper wrote down of what something that the holy spirit taught you amen would you have anything to write on it brother brother i got nothing what would i tell you as your pastor i probably tell you you really need to listen to the teacher a little closer huh are you with me because how many knows god the holy spirit is working with you he's working with every one of us every day trying to teach you all things everything that you need to know hey man i ain't afraid to say it if you are that's the truth right oh my when i think brother glenn when i think of what the holy spirit has already taught me come on i should have got an amen from a lot more of you because i know there's a lot sitting out there that the holy spirit has taught you a whole lot already ah learning to lead learning to lead i'm learning to lead on jesus finding more power than i ever dreamed because why i'm learning to lean we're learning to trust i've learned to trust in god amen i've learned to believe his word to trust in him he has taught us that no matter what comes your way [Music] no matter how much people mistreats you amen that you're supposed to love them anyway the only way you could ever love them anyway is to never let it get to you never let it bother the second that you let that get to you they got you and people will do stuff to you just to get you mad no christians yeah that's when your flags go up right this guy's supposed to be a christian right and not everybody that clean name of christ a christian you find out right quick i'm here to tell you you don't always know what spirit people are sometimes you don't know what spirit you're off amen everybody disagrees anybody wraps you wrong boy you're ready to destroy him even the prophet of god had to come to the place to where he could look at that young couple that was kissing all over each other and they had been corrected two or three times and they were worthy of being said they'll carry you out like ananias and savara and i grant you there ain't going to be no more kissing around this church drop dead nobody else would be doing no kissing in church but he didn't do it that way didn't he no very unusual right because the other prophet that i remember was the name of elisha elijah he had a ball they didn't have any hey [Music] he couldn't help that he didn't have any bare hair and them kids had heard their mom and daddy mock him on the dinner table and said he claimed to be a servant of god that ball to it so when the kids got out there he says go on up ball head like elijah did go on up bald head huh and what did he have did he have love he had no love at all i curse you in the name of god and god has to honor the prophet's word god always honors the prophet word huh and then poor innocent kids because kids just do what they learn i'll tell you who should have dropped dead with the parents at home that's who should have got mauled but no because of that because he cursed them god destroyed 42 of them folks i'm here to tell you it wasn't no pretty a picture to have a bunch of couple of she bears coming out of the woods and tear them them kids to pieces but it did but it wasn't the right thing to do amen come on let's just admit it that's what we do a lot of times if we aren't careful we still ain't got the love that we should have you ain't a mature christian folks you haven't you aren't ready to graduate you ain't ready to have the gods come and speak to you and say say what you will and it'll be done unless you've got that perfect love in your heart are you with me and you can only learn whether you got that or not when people rub you wrong it goes against your grain 100 [Music] that's right so i'm thankful i'm be thankful for what god has taught you it meant through trials every sunday comes has to be tried and tested amen you have to learn things the preacher can't teach you that's right because there's nothing like hands-on experience like learning from experience experience is the best teacher folks how many know many of us have to admit some of us might brag about how hard-headed we are yeah i am so hard-headed let me tell you if you're a human being you're so hard-headed everywhere every human being is hard-headed every human being can be super evil huh nothing to brag about the human part the only thing worth bragging about is the christ part what god does through you amen but we have to learn the hard way how many says say i gotta most of the time the only way i learn is the hard way well in a way that's good in another way it's not but let me tell you something even god has to put you through the trial so that you can learn the hard way amen israel they thought oh hallelujah praise god shaking and shouting they got plum horse they were so happy leaving egypt first thing god did was try to teach them something remember the bible says they have not known my ways they don't know me very well let me tell you something if you're gonna know anything about god when you claim the name of christianity you can know this one thing god is gonna find out whether you got what you claim to have or not amen now i'm going to tell you this right now any leader at all is not fit to lead until he's been through these things that's why he talks about a pastor not being no novice huh was 29 years old and i was almost too green right i have to learn a lot of stuff yet the hard way things i would never do today amen but no remember what i'm saying is you're worthy of leading once you have proven yourself once you have went through the hall of critics i mean those nobody goes to the hall of fame unless you first go through the hall of creeks everybody that you can think of criticizing you like job i secret sinner you've asked you that that couldn't happen to a christian man and oh my god everybody tries to fall find all the fault in you they possibly can huh they did jesus they tried to get him in his words get him in here they always watching amen for every fault you know amen you're not ready for the hall of fame too you went through the hall of critics amen but i love it because listen the one thing that we learn is to learn to lean on him learn to trust him amen not on your own ability but on god's ability and learn this other thing and that is endurance how many believes you have to learn endurance let me just go to hebrews i'm going to talk about endurance brother branham thought that it'd be over with by 1977. i'm sure glad it wasn't because i didn't come in until 83 or 82 huh i was still a sinner out there running with the devil on the highway to hell that's right i'm glad i wasn't in that state when jesus come he had mercy and grace on me amen aren't you glad for that [Music] all right hebrews 12th chapter and let me see here hebrews 12. looking unto jesus verse 2 author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set down before him endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself least ye be weary and fate in your minds you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and have you forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as children my son despise thou not the chastening of the lord nor faint with our rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chastens us and scourges every son whom he receiveth amen amen i heard brother brown says man why people say why are you always scolding people why are you always so hard on people why are you always rebuking them can somebody in here telling me why he was always rebuking them because he loved him huh most of the time when somebody rebukes us for our sin oh the first thing we do is think about that person in his sin right well you ain't feel good yourself right rather than saying thank you brother thank you sister i appreciate that because i don't want that in my life i don't want to be that way our response should be i'm sorry brother i'm sorry sister that i did that or am that way huh that's a correct response are you with me the devil and carnality will try to make you look at the other person i'm not concerned about the other person right now i'm concerned about this person amen and rebuke does us good amen because it's love even god said in revelations as many as i love i rebuke oh brother bother you gotta quit stepping on my toes when i come to church no no you should say thank you for stepping on my toes huh yeah you got i've got faults you can look back at my faults when i look at your fault be that way if you want huh i ain't perfect y'all know everybody knows but i'm not perfect i sure ain't but i'm striving to be let me tell you something none of you are perfect and i'm not looking at that i'm looking at what you want to be amen of where we want to be and that's the right way to look at folks not everybody's in eighth grade or college some people just starting amen so notice here every son scourges every son whom he receiveth and if you endure chastisement god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he that who the father chasteneth not correcteth not and if you be without chastisement or chastening or correction or rebuke then you're oh well all are partakers and are you bastards and not sons brother abandon one place i forget the exact words i wanted to look it up but he said sometimes he feels like just sitting on the top of the pulpit he called this whole church while a bunch of illegitimate bastards he was hard i'll have to pull that quote up sometime but he was hard because that's what they were no matter how much jesus would do know how much much proof he would give him no much how much the scriptures he would take they would not be corrected they wouldn't be chased eyes they would not take karook and there's only one category that fits them in and that's bastards bats are children and not sons is that right because the real son of god takes correction amen you don't realize in the old testament that if the son would not be corrected would not be correct it would not be correct and he was rebellious what happened to him they took him outside and stoned him with stones until he drawed his last breath that's what god thinks of rebellion i believe one place the bible says rebellion is as a sin of witchcraft amen my my mind so that's what this generation i mean that's what this generation that's what the church world out there is that's why they have bisexual bishops they have homosexuals and everything else they allied because they never would take correction now look at where they are like i said wednesday look at the condition of the women in the church and see what the convert the church is like going there to dress like a bunch of prostitutes that's what that church is a prostitute church the preachers have got no more audacity than they stand in the pope and say anything against it no they're getting paid so much a week or whatever it is huh it's about the money it's not about the money folks it's about your soul that's what it's all about amen when it doesn't it's nothing but of the devil amen all right oh my make sure your spirit is right how many believe that we got to make sure that our spirit is right many times we don't have tolerance we don't have patience how many believe we got to have patience with one another you cross me and i don't have patience with you i don't care if i do think that your judas is scared i still want to have hope for you i still want to believe for you amen jesus did he kept going back to those pharisees and scribes and pharisees and trying to get them converted even after he knew they were of their father the devil straight up came and said whoa let me tell you something you think this is strong preaching you you know jesus himself down here it'd probably be strong when i'm giving it he called him they said he were off he got him so mad that they was gonna kill him several times they were gonna kill him jesus congregation got so mad they're gonna kill him he had to get a angel to make him invisible and the bible says he walks right through the midst of them they didn't even see him praise be to god god is good i mean love the lord let's give the lord and say thank you jesus awesome awesome to serve the lord ain't it nothing better than the word nothing better in the world than to get a little proto plasma simulation nothing better for us than to get a good whipping i'm talking about let the god correct you that's right when you do something wrong let everything that day for you fall apart that's right when you get up you step your little toe on the edge of the bed it hurts like crazy huh that's right you don't go down the seat go down the stairs gotta quit oh my you missed the last step you almost fly out the back door it's just everything right lord knows how to get your attention amen how many wants to be blessed and not cursed amen you can't live in sin and expect the blessings of the lord it's not going to happen that way got to be right with god you gotta listen to that teacher how many believes this morning that's my message this morning is the teacher wants to teach you young people the teacher wants to teach you we got a lot to learn and you have to listen to that voice on the inside to learn it amen let me go back in time just a little bit this church was having all the trouble all of our trouble that we were having i'd get down on my knees sometime and say lord give me the answer lord give me an answer tell me how to do this what to do and he'd tell me how to do it and i do that amen and i'd have deacons and i says do you have the answer for it do you have the answer for this problem i have to get it i think you have to get it too i think you need the right answer because if you don't have the right answer you're going to do the wrong thing when you do the wrong thing you're dearly going to pay for it huh how many believes we've got to have the holy spirit to tell us the right thing and sometimes that don't come easy but it comes if you really search it you'll really find out what is lord what is it because this is what i feel like to it but god what is it that you want me to do and there's a peace and a comfort that comes with knowing what you're supposed to do amen can i say this while i am thinking about it i believe the two two two statements that will fulfill whether or not you're ready for adoption and whether you're in the place that you ought to be and that one statement is the statement that jesus said he says i always do that which pleases the father can you make that statement can you say you i always do but please the father if you aren't you're not ready for adoption yet you're not ready for authority to for him to come down like he did for the brother bantam just tell me who are those squirrels how many squirrels you want and where do you want them squirrels to appear how many knows god told him to hold that god told him to stop that storm up on the mountain and then and he said shine for three days and there was a great big monstrous storm coming amen and everybody knew it was going to last for days and all of a sudden that storm just disappeared because god was up there and he says now you say to this perform what you want and he did same way he did with that woman with that couple down there say what you will to them and it'll be done amen how many believes a guy can speak to you he can speak to me like that but you got to be at the place of jesus we got to come to the place of adoption come to the place that god can invest his authority and his power in you because i think if we was real honest folks this road rage isn't going to work huh that's right our anger and our issues and things like that that's not going to work in our christian walk why because we would speak things the wrong way amen so i think this morning we can all grow in that area we can learn i can i know i've got a long ways to go yet folks praise the lord i hope you're enjoying this because i labored hard for the lord to give it to me amen lord lord help me lord help me amen this is not an easy job if i mess up i have to answer to god it's not good if i say the wrong thing amen i want to you know i thank god i thank god for his grace because i'm not perfect i make mistakes and i thank god that he forgives me for when i do things wrong or say things wrong sometimes in the pulpit i'll say something that afterwards i said you should have said that huh and i say sorry lord help me amen or in that way amen how many is with me saying that sometimes i do things i shouldn't think i think act in ways i shouldn't i don't want to do that anyway and let me just say something else this morning let me teach you one more thing and that is that many times we do things in the haste and this just comes to be refreshed and it's because we're not as patient as what we should be we're in too much of a hurry i believe the prophet of god taught us that he says that's when we do things we shouldn't normal or don't normally do is because we're in too much of hurry all of our businesses and everything when i was growing up folks brother irvin knows hey we got to get a pallet of pellet down every 10 minutes hurry hurry hurry hurry let's go we were talking hurry hurry i can hurry ever since brother i'm just now slowing down brother why because we're in this generation everything is geared you know time is money come on now right and we get into a frantic state and we do things say things get impatient get upset when really that's not the important thing folks i was reading ecclesiastes yesterday and where solomon talked about everything here is all vanity and vexation of spirit you should see how many times solomon talked about how this world and everything even the labor that we do and all of that is vanity and vexation of spirit because it all doesn't mean nothing it all fades away he says i've gotten everything that can be gotten i've had multitudes that are the other and all i know is that one day somebody else is gonna have get all of that and are they gonna be as wise as what i was with it no they'll probably just spend it all in two days in other words all vanity and then he said vexation of spirit in other words he said the more i think about it the more i understand how this world really works the more vexed i am yeah there's only one thing that gives you peace and hope and that is the holy ghost that is christ that's salvation how many know that's the only joy that we really have the only peace that we really have everything else is vanity and vexation of spirit to think that one of these days my boys are going to have to look and down the casket and see me there cold and stiff and dead that's why it's kind of talking about god forbid that they would go before me i think about my wife i thought i looked at her yesterday she was sleeping there and just snoring a little bit i said when she takes her last breath i think i want to take my last breath yeah and i said you know that's this world that's what it's all coming to you amen all coming down to the grave folks even the solid as you brought nothing with you you ain't taking nothing with you what do you have what's it all for how many we want to try to find the true purpose of life if you don't find that you lost everything amen you love him this morning praise the lord sometimes we can have a wrong spirit not realize it all right i believe it was uh peter he was very zealous for the lord he was a good christian but yet whenever they tried to take jesus what did he try to do he tried to take somebody's ear off did he or was he really having for the year come on people i can't help but think it's aiming a little bit different myself right aim for the year and cut the ear off what is that got it bit holyfield's ear off right no no i believe it's going for the head he was serious i'm willing to die for you you know and all this ain't nobody gonna take you he had the wrong spirit wrong attitude he's not the only one it came to pass when time was come that he should be received up jesus he steadfastly set his face hard to go to jerusalem and he sent messenger before his face and they went and entered into a village of sumerian the samaritans to make ready for him but they did not receive him this is in luke 9 did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord well now that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what matter of spirit you are of come on message people sometimes people don't realize what spirit they got on amen you get to where you want to destroy everybody just because they don't agree with you or rub you the wrong way remember that's the wrong attitude that's the wrong spirit lord help us to go past that here they were and they didn't receive them and james and john amen they said we wanted to call fire but they must have had a lot of faith right they just had a lot of faith they gonna burn them samaritans jesus just shook his head lord you boys have a lot to learn how many beliefs we still got a lot to learn folks amen that's right how many knows in this world one thing that something else that we learn and that is in this world you're not first you're not top dog you're last you're last amen because we the bible says the last shall be first and the first shall be last if you want to be great don't be the boss be servant to everybody be the doormat be the dorm i'm the doormat i'm the garbage man i'm the cleaning lady huh that's we all are in this world the off scouring sheep amongst wolves amen let me see if i can find something i've kind of got jumped around here a bit but i'd like to find that over here it is next page i never go over to over one page hardly if i have two pages i'm going to get confused i think most of my messages brother brad's been on one page sometimes a little bit of two but that's why i like the extra long one all right let me see if we can find this in luke six let's go to luke six it's about twelve o'clock we'll have communion how many is ready for communion tonight i mean this this morning amen look no luke six okay that's just a couple pages back all right starting verse 20 this is what we're called to and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be you poor for yours is the kingdom of god blessed are you that hunger now for you shall be filled blessed are ye when ye shall weep thou for ye shall laugh how many believes we ought to be weeping for this world weeping for what's fixing to happen weeping for the sin that's done in the city remember jesus the richest most spiritual growed up adopted son whom jesus i mean who god glorified on the mount with shining apparel and said hear ye him this is my beloved son he didn't even have a place to lay his head did he foxes have her or holes of nests amen but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head laugh laugh shall blessed are you when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you folks i can't help but believe that the way that this world is going there's going to be a lot more of this we're going to feel more of this the persecution what did paul say yea all that live righteously shall suffer persecution i believe it is people will persecute you if you really do what's right people will hate you if you do what's right you're not just going to be you're going to be loved by the brethren but the world's going to hate you they hate us amen how many knows we're on the internet ain't no telling how long we're going to be able to be on the internet you know what's going to be said they're a bunch of haters that that's hate preaching that's what that's what will be said all kinds of evil things amen already how many knows brother donnie and different ones some of those feel it already because they preach what the prophet taught about race and color and all that amen cast your name out as evil for the son of man's sake rejoice in that day and leap for joy and behold your reward is great in heaven for enlightenment did they the fathers and their fathers unto the prophets that woe unto you that are rich you have you received your consolation how many knows that the lay out of the cia said they were rich and increased with goods and had need of nothing in other words if we're full there's so many people that's satisfied i don't care how many stakes i have look how nice a home i have i don't care if i drive a brand new ford chevy or whatever it is you drive i'm still never satisfied unless i know that the holy spirit is leading me in guiding me how many is with me no matter how well you have it folks church evening like no matter how good you have but remember this you should always hunger and thirst for more of god you should have so much of the love of god in your heart and i'll be honest with you i'm raising my hand this morning i want more of that love more of that love that causes me to travail to pray to be in travail day and night from my own faults for your faults amen for the sins that's done in the city for the world and the condition that it is and realizing what's going to happen to people that are outside of christ and how horrible it's going to be to have compassion one to you that are full for ye shall hunger one to you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers the false prophets but i say unto you which here love your enemies and do get that good to them that hate you amen how many believes that we've learned that how many is with me this morning how many has learned to be able to hate not hate but to love people who don't like you no i'm not saying that they don't hate you but they don't like you you can actually look for something good if they were broke down beside the road you would do anything in your power to help them any way that you could how many ways we need more of the love of god in our hearts but abandonment is preaching here you hear me preaching in this adoption a lot of this is what i got this morning he went to talking about love at the end how people don't have they have falling outs over baptisms over this that or the other all they had these falling out he says what is the holy spirit going to report back to the father how is he going to how he how ashamed that he must be let me just say this here and on radio land everywhere out there think about this how do you think jesus feels about having 900 different churches out of what he taught and those churches being against each other how do you think that makes him feel you think he would say yeah that's what i intended or is it the 17th chapter of john he says that you all might be one as we are one that's what god wanted that's what christ wants everybody to be one now i want to say this that in this generation through to malachi 4 through to brother branham he called all these churches together he said forget your denominational differences let's come back to the word of god he called for that unity he called for that oneness he gave her space to repent but she would not repent how many believes that he called jesus christ called for the unity of all the churches but they would not now guess where they're going into the echoing mechanical console into the mark of the beast and they will have to drink of the wine of the wrath of god because all those that don't have the mark of god in their foreheads how many knows they partake of the wrath of god amen so i say this morning to you lord help us to do what paul told the ephesians paul told the ephesians church that he henceforth be no more children toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine be wise let the holy spirit teach you as john said these things have i written concerning them that seduce you that the anointing which you have teach you how many knows preachers people want to seduce you they want to mislead you they want to misguide you take advantage of you amen that's not what a true servant of god does they want to lead you to christ for your benefit not their benefit not selfishness don't be carried away with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men to cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love that you may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ he gave us apostles and prophets evangelists teachers teachers for the perfecting of the saint has this helped you this morning how many likes a little teaching for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come to the unity of the faith to the acknowledge to the end of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ i feel i believe like paul said i groan i believe i groan i labor i i am in travail paul said until christ be formed in you how many is doing that this morning i travail each one of us is travailing laboring until christ is completely formed in you and in me and like he said until people will look at you and see christ so much until they'll say i want to be like you young people they'll say i want to be like you i want to i want what you got how many wants to live that kind of life to where your neighbors your customers whatever it might be well i don't know what you got where do you go to church you know that's one of the first questions that people will ask you if they got confidence in you where do you go to church because they probably want to go to church you go to because of the kind of person that you are because you like christ and they like how you are and didn't want to be like you homies with me how many wants to be that way stand with me this morning i want to thank everybody for praying for me how many praise for me hands let me see your hands thank you i want to know without a doubt that y'all are praying for me because i know that's what helps us brother brad isn't it to know that people are praying for you that god will give you what we have need of this morning i mean that it'll feed our soul amen was praying this morning even as uh you know that the lord will just shower blessings upon us that he'd wash us with his word that he just get us clean and get us ready to meet him amen let's bow our heads from the bottom of your heart would you give the lord permission to teach you more say lord teach me all things lord i certainly aren't i'm not there yet about all things lord but father i give you permission god this coming week i want to listen to that teacher that's teaching me these things in a greater way than what i have last week father lord you see the hands all over the place god we raise our hands and say lord teach us thy ways teaches everything that we need to know lord help us lord jesus that we might be ready to come to that place of adoption to where you come down and you can speak to our hearts and if we want to proclaim a blessing on somebody or or pray for somebody or whatever it might be lord whatever you tell us to do then when we speak it it'll come into existence it'll happen we'll be asked and it will be done unto us lord jesus seek and we'll find we'll knock and it shall be open lord help us god because we know that you're not just going to give that a power you're not going to give the authority of signing that check and and having that checkbook lord just to anybody we've got to grow up from children into adulthood lord i believe that we're going there we're getting there lord but we've still got a ways to go father and we ask god that you would bless each and every one this morning with a closer walk with you more dedicated walk with you lord patience have more patience and more endurance not be so fast slow down and care more about our salvation and and the salvation of others and what we're doing for christ and we are so caught up in our work until it becomes top priority lord let that not be let living your life be top priority in each and every one of our lives and lord now as father we always change the order of service lord and we remember god that you said this due in remembrance of me as often as you drink it and lord that we just ask god as we have take the the wine father and the bread to remember god that you was broken for us lord lord this morning as i was praying over the bread and this is my body which is broken for you lord i thought about it father of how when i was breaking that bread those stripes that were put on your back the cuts that they made the bleeding everywhere the thorn in your head stuck down in your scales skeletons so to speak your skull under your skin and how it hurt how horrible it hurt the stripes on your back the body that was broken for us the spear that went into your side it was done for us lord and we'd want to remember that this morning and honor you by obeying what you said do that we should do this in remembrance of you we want to obey every command that you give us god every command for you said there in saint john he that loveth me keepeth my commandments and he that loveth me not keepeth them not so lord we want to do as you have asked us to do in jesus name amen and amen god bless you this morning amen amen you can be seated for a minute amen so we want to take the communion i want to try to observe this you know i'm thankful that things went well you know with uh having our get-together and everything and so we do want to have i know it is still around i know that old
