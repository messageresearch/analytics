[Music] to be a place where the Lord is welcome to be a place where he can dwell and reign supreme thank you brother God bless you tonight Zachary Wallace from Lima Ohio I go to church there with brother Jonathan Martin he said to please extend his greetings down to you here God bless you and uh I come from Arizona for upwards of 30 years out there and was with brother Ted pasadley which I'm sure many of you know him as well and so just really happy to be here tonight I didn't get to bring with me I have a wife of four kids and but they're in school so it just didn't work out but we're here tonight helping a brother Austin Freeman his house yeah yeah and you sure like it hot down here in Kentucky I'm telling you it's pretty rough something I was thinking about today is you know at least we don't have to worry about you down here just going to church to try and Escape hell or something or you'd be out of the state of Kentucky that's the way I was feeling today out in that heat it was pretty rough but uh we'll just uh go to the word of the Lord tonight and Joshua the fifth chapter and uh take a text there kind of gonna move a little bit fast tonight I I took a similar line of thought Sunday back at the home church but uh it went a little bit long so I had to just start cutting away and that's tough on a preacher you know cutting things out so we'll just put it into a little higher year and hopefully we'll we'll get you a sleepy kentuckian's home in time so Joshua the fifth chapter beginning at verse 13 says and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him now if you see a man standing with a weapon you're on you're just gonna March right up to him this was a man under a Divine Commission and he said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host the Lord am I come now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant and captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where on thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so we see Joshua having experience here with the same one that Moses had an experience with and he walks away with the same Authority I'd like to take a text tonight on surrendering to the absolute let's just go to the Lord in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to yield ourselves to you tonight Lord we want you to come down have preeminence in your people and in your word we just ask that your word would be spoken to the heart and I ask that every one of us would be completely yielded and surrendered to the authority of your word in this hour in the name of Jesus Christ may be seated tonight brother so he comes here and he talks to this captain of the host or the general of the armies of the Lord and he says what do you want to tell me and he begins to communicate with him now we don't get the rest of of what they talked about here written down but brother Branham over in uh this day this scripture is fulfilled he he sheds a little light on that and he says they were there marching around Jericho the last time and the walls fell down Joshua could have stood up and said this day the chief captain of the host of the Lord told me weeks ago that it would happen like this this day this scripture is fulfilled there laid the walls flat on the ground come on let's go take it it belongs to us this day this scripture is fulfilled now what I want to look at is how that man Joshua he came in contact with nothing less than God himself and it gave him a word it gave him marching orders it gave him Direction it gave him purpose it told him what you need to do to live an overcoming life it told him what you need to do to take out the enemy stronghold he got his direct orders from that and when he followed that he's seen the supernatural released in his life but it without that word without that direction he would have been trying who knows what method to try and accomplish this purpose he had some general idea we're supposed to take this land but how is he going to do it well he got in contact with an absolute he got in contact with that same one that had told Moses what was going to happen when he was out there hurting sheep out in the wilderness and he comes in contact with him and then you had that absolute now this is the infallible word of God this is God's word any kind of a ministry that's built upon anything else besides this is an heir that's God's word primarily first and basic God's word it's an absolute now an absolute it has no restrictions no exceptions or qualifications now that there is no nothing that qualifies this to be the absolute all right now I want to explain why that's really important if you say well the Bible is right because brother Byler said it's right well now this is getting into Authority from you and now he's the absolute and he said well why do you believe the Bible is absolutely says oh well you see there was an archaeologist who dug up a rock that matched something that they had in the Bible so now we believe the Bible is the absolutely it's like so we're tracing that all the way back and now your Authority is actually coming from the archaeologist no this is the final say this is the end of the question this is the end of the line this is the final place where you find truth it's the word of God there's nothing or if you can just catch this there's nothing that makes God God there's nobody that makes him that's decided this is going to be God no that's what he is in himself it's something called intrinsic value it's something that cannot be affected by anything else on the outside it is what it is and the word of God is the absolute and there's nothing that qualifies it there's nothing big enough to say well I'm gonna lend my support behind this and make it an authority no it's the final Authority there's no court of appeals when it comes to the word of God friends if you find something in the word of God you don't like you can't appeal it to the next you know higher level no you got to surrender to it now you can try and fight you know your local cord here you might argue with the local representative or the sheriff that lives next door to you maybe you know him real well or whatever you might have your argument with him you might take a case to farther and farther and farther but finally it hits the end of the line in the United States that's the Supreme Court and when it hits that that's it it's done there's no argument left final word we have an absolute it's a final word now an absolute is perfect in itself Unlimited in its power primarily an ultimate now brother brand preached an absolute four or five different times and he really lays it in there beautifully uh the word of God is infallible infallible means it's something that cannot be wrong so whatever it does is right yeah yeah if it can't be wrong it also means infallible means it cannot fail now every one of you is fallible every one of you can fail and has failed and will fail but this will never fail the word of God is infallible what it speaks stands now you got to have something in your life that's your absolute you got to have something that's your Anchor Point there's some thing there's something in your life that you're basing everything else off of if that's your own opinion if that's your absolute you're building on sink in Sands if you're basing it off of whatever cultural society says that this is right or this is normal where's that going to take you people are trying to build their life out of an absolute but it's an absolute that they've made up themselves and it doesn't work it does not have solid a solid foundation to it and so anything comes along and suddenly they say well you know what we're going to change you know we're going to change the absolute and now uh yeah a man can be a woman and a woman can be a man nonsense they can change that all they want but they're still an absolute truth it's not your thought it's not my thought it's his thoughts [Applause] now the word is your absolute but the word is more than just a sentence or a verse in the Bible now I know this is kind of quibbling a little bit but it's important all right I we could open up just to uh to Exodus here chapter 12 and we could read here it says that to the children of Israel he speaks to them and he says every year you must slay a lamb for sacrifice that is the word of God anybody want to argue it's absolutely the word of God he says every year you've got a lamb how many here have went out yearly in slay lamb nobody here I didn't think so now do you believe this or not God said to do that do you understand what I'm saying all right that's where it comes down to being really important about the message for your hour but it's not just one verse [Music] you have to take God's word from Genesis to Revelations and when you take it together you find out that that lamb sacrifice has been fulfilled and there is a sacrifice that's not the slave for once you know every year but it was slain once for all and it has taken away sin forever there is a fulfillment of that scripture verse there's more to the story and when you take this word of God from Genesis to Revelations then you get the entirety of what the word is saying but if you just take one little verse or one little quote you can get almost anything you want to imagine out of it you can come and say well I can show you right here in the Bible that Jesus wasn't God because it says Jesus wept yeah it says that but your little theory is thinner than the argument made out of the shadow of the broth of the chicken that starved to death there's no real substance to it it doesn't line up with the word of God now the absolute your absolute must be the word but the word is more than just paper and ink the word well The Book of John it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God what do we call that the logos the pillar of fire that is the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and what do we call that Jesus Christ brother brand says in the absolute and if you're absolute to some organization or some sensation or something else besides the person of Jesus Christ you'll come to the same portion of Shame speaking of these people the same portion of Shame only worse see if your absolute is not Christ it's the only centerpost of the human life and Christ is the word not your church your word the word see upon this absolute I'll build my church upon Christ the word now it's more than just ink it's more than just you know paper it is a living low loss it's a Living Word it's Jesus Christ that is your typos that is your absolute and you've got to recognize where Jesus is at you gotta recognize what's happening in your hour otherwise you'll miss what God's doing right now because you're looking back to what Jesus did a year ago and you got to recognize him right now now if we if we pull over here to uh the Old Testament for a few minutes I want to look at what is the Bible what is the word of God that we hold so so valuably well what are the five first five books of the Bible who wrote those Moses all right and uh we got here the books the the Joshua we got Samuel we got some histories of the kings that were recorded we've got uh job she was a prophet we've got uh Psalms David he was a prophet we've got uh Isaiah what was he Jeremiah Ezekiel well I can go through all the rest of them but you know the answer they were Prophets we have a few histories recorded there and different things like that but when somebody stands there and begins to say here is the word of the Lord and it's recorded for us it's a prophet now that's very important we get to the New Testament we have Matthew Mark Luke and John recorded histories of Jesus speaking and the messages he brought and then the rest of the New Testament primarily was broke by one man and what was he he was a prophet you've seen a continuity here you're seeing how God operates when God came down to Moses he comes down that Pillar of Fire and he meets with him and he says to Moses I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians Moses no doubt had a Jubilee He says I've been worried about them poor fellows for a long time thank you Lord you're going down to deliver them that's wonderful and then a few moments later God says come now therefore and I will send thee God didn't change his mind on what he was doing their friends he didn't say I'm gonna come down no no bad idea I'm not doing that actually I'm going to send you instead no no it wasn't I'm sending you instead I have come down and what they're going to see is you and Moses he stepped out there and he began to speak to them and God began to vindicate his ministry like you you wouldn't believe and begin to show signs and wonders and Supernatural he leads them out of there they part the Red Sea and they're trying to kill Moses left and right if you just look at it they're they're they don't know understand they don't have a clue what a messenger word Prophet is they're like this man's lifting himself up okay you go you go read the story you go read the history you read uh you read numbers uh 13 and 14. you read where Miriam and and Aaron they looked at Moses and they says you're not the only Holy One and they began to speak against him and the scripture says and God heard it it came down into the church the woman Maryam and Aaron were both judged by God and Mary and the church was struck with Leprosy which represents sin you walked a congregation and a Ministry begin to disrespect God's prophet and you watch if sin doesn't just run rampant through that congregation now they just didn't get it they didn't understand you see they never really have understood that that man's not just doing this on his own this isn't his idea this isn't his message and Moses stood there again and again and God Vindicated him dathan and cores raised up the Earth opened up and swallowed up their Ministries there was just time and again that God stood there and Vindicated that Prophet to the people and they'd murmur and they'd complain and the scripture even says Moses says you're not murmuring against us you're murmuring against God they just had a hard time looking past the veil and seeing what God was really doing and Moses he comes out of the land of his land of Israel and he says God's going to give you this land he says now you obey my word he says you don't alter from it if you'll obey my word God's Gonna bless you if you disobey my word going to curse you now that's pretty strong words for a man to say like who does he think he is really yeah to stand up there and say you're going to listen to what I say or you're going to be cursed I mean I want you to put yourself in their shoes in their day what would you have thought judge it off of what you think right now how many scripture verses prophesied of Moses's Ministry one or two God said he was going to visit them they didn't have a lot they could go back to in the scripture and see a Ministry for hold that was going to come and give them covenants and laws and ways to live everyday life and how to cook their food and how to dress their family they didn't have these this four telling of this ministry that was going to come but it was a Vindicated Ministry we come I don't know maybe three four thousand years after that and there's a man stands up in Paul and he begins to bring a Ministry and he says the circumcision that Abraham our forefathers gave us irrelevant you don't need it yeah and this was something that was tearing up the Christian church they were all you know but God gave it to Abraham this is the law like the Gentiles should be circumcised this is important and Paul walks up and he says that is no more yeah just fulfilled sacrifices you don't need them keeping holy days and all these things he says no no no you're on the wrong line and they could take them back to the word of God and say but here it is here's where it says this is what Paul was standing there telling them you're in the Fulfillment of Prophecy here's where we're at right now now Paul how many scripture verses speak of Paul's Ministry said he was going to come with this ministry of a new testament like what is there you ever done a study on that brother how many scripture verses prophesy of Paul's Ministry I mean we have scriptures talking about John the Baptist and other ones right but what spoke of Paul it's just not really there now he stands up and he begins to give them thus saith the Lord for that generation and then he has the audacity to write in second Timothy or second Thessalonians 3 14 If any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed a code as this guy think he is and he really didn't have that shining of a background he was out there murdering Christians and then he but he was only says yeah count them not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother he's saying don't even associate with somebody that won't listen to what I'm saying me we were having devotions the other day and my so my seven-year-old he was trying to figure out you know what to do about that because he's like says not even to have company with them but to admonish him as a brother so you know you got to be seeing him or something so his conclusion as a seven-year-old was that you can't be best friends and you know you're exactly right brother says you show me your company I'll show you what you are what Fellowship has light with Darkness now the position of a Vindicated word prophet is beyond our comprehension friends Paul goes on in First Corinthians 14 37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let it acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord in other words whenever I say goes what I'm saying is an absolute that's what Ball's telling them he says but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant Galatians 1 8. but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say I now again just in case you thought he made a mistake there so say that again if any man preached any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed now again that's a very bold way to speak it's a very it's a great audacity to stand there and put out a a word of God like that and say if an angel from heaven tries to correct what I'm telling you he's cursed do you realize the position of a Vindicated word prophet is above any angel his ministry is beyond any Angel if an angel would try and come and contradict that message that angel would be cursed now you know where we're headed how many scriptures speak of William branham's Ministry we could start in Genesis to Revelations and we'd be here for weeks so we won't do that uh in one place in Christ's mystery of God revealed he's talking about how that that last final mystery is revealed in every single type that's in the Bible and that's directly tied into William branham's Ministry so I'm not exaggerating when I say it's everywhere through the scriptures but we could we could go we could look at the types and shadows of it of it we could we could see how like it was in Noah's day we could look at how it was uh in in Isaac and Rebecca it was such a beautiful type there of a Ministry going to bring forth a bride this is this whole thing has been about God's hidden purpose God's had a hidden purpose a plan for for thousands of years what he's been trying to accomplish and the Met Ministry that he brought forth to accomplish that purpose to bring forth that bride was William Miriam Branham now Luke 17 26 as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man when you see that right there do you know it's talking about this lasting Ministry Luke 17 28 likewise also as it was in the days of life they were when it rained firing Brimstone out of the heaven and destroyed them all he says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed the revealing of the son of man is what happened in William branham's Ministry it was the revealing of the son of man now we could go through and through and through with these different scripture verses but I believe you're a church that's been taught and understand the hour that we're living in uh it's not nothing new to you but what I want to try and establish with you today is the authority that that Messengers word says on all right I want you to recognize that and then what I want you to do is surrender to the absolute now the pillar of Fire maybe maybe not okay we have this one here um brother Branham was in uh Sam Houston Coliseum there and uh and he and he was there for that debate and as he was there he comes down to the platform he steps up there and then the how the angel came to me in his commission I listened to the other day it was just beautiful he says and I and I said well that's all but I said but for myself I can do nothing of my own self and I said if I tell the truth God's obligated to me to witness that it's the truth and those are some strong words right there he says this is what he was repeating if I tell the truth God's obligated me to witness that it's the truth and about that time something went and here he come coming right down telling the truth God's obligated to witness that I'm telling the truth and a pillar of fire which is the logos came down and showed that he was witnessing what this man is saying is the truth and then he goes on in that sermon of how the angel came in his commission gets to the prayer line and he deserves seven different people Discerning their lives or things that happen to them and it goes through like that and I didn't count but I was wondering how many times do we see Jesus Discerning the life of people in the scripture how many times do we have where he comes with Samuel he says you are an Israelite in whom there is no guile and he says when did you know me he says oh well before you came to the meeting when you're out behind that tree I saw you praying he says you're the son of God he recognized immediately with one Vindication one discernment he recognized this is God and we have seven in a row right here and I don't know how many it comes out with Jesus recorded in the scriptures what's recorded we have Peter you know you are you're Simon the son of Jonas he knew him he knew his father different situations like that and those ones that seen that Vindication they said it's enough yeah now there's thousands upon thousands of vindications friends how much do you need how much do you need before you will just simply say I believe what that man was saying because it's not his message it was not his word it was the word of God a Vindicated word prophet now we have received a Vindicated word of supreme authority in this hour it is an absolute that Pillar of Fire is where that message came from this message is not the message of William random this message is the word logos that was expressed through a channel through a vessel and that vessel was so yielded to God that God was able to speak through him and this is not the words of a man this is the logos now what that means friends is that this message is the absolute for this message is Jesus Christ oh when you can recognize that not by intellect but down on the inside of the inside when you can recognize that then when you hear a word spoken by a prophet and regarding your life regarding the bride in this hour it puts such a faith in your heart because you know beyond a shadow of a doubt if he said that if he said that there would be a pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God I don't care how it feels that I couldn't be that if the prophet of God said that then that is what I'm going to be if he said that my sins were forgiven and that I am justified it's the same as if I had never done it in the first place if that's what the prophet said then that's what I believe and I stand Justified when you recognize the authority of the word when you when you see the power of it then you just yield to it you surrender to it and as it speaks over your life you're not saying oh but I don't know how I could ever you were never in the equation to begin with which this is a covenant God swore by himself this is the Covenant he made I am going to have a bride there is going to be a bride she will be without Smart she will be without wrinkle now you just have to yield yourself surrender yourself to that Authority and let God come down and perform the supernatural surrender to that absolute now I I'll go through a couple of things real quick here uh when Birdman would be on that curtain of time he's seen those Saints who were there in that Dimension and they said Paul that there was going to be a judging of the word that was given and he says does Paul's group have to be judged they said yes he says well if his group goes in mine does too because I said everything that he said I preached the exact same gospel that he preached and the millions that were there screamed out were arresting on that there is a rest there is a peace that comes with knowing you're anchored in an absolute if you can recognize your day end its message there is a rest like no other you have an anchor you have a peace now they're resting on it over there and I'm resting on it here now at every age Satan has had great success in carrying out his threat anybody know what that threat was it was to exalt himself above the most high he would Ascend above the clouds and the Stars brother ramp says he has had marvelous success in carrying out his threats by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's promised word to that age so Satan is going to do everything he possibly can to keep you from valuing this message of the hour Satan's primary objective is to get you not to Value this all right and the objective and the goal of the ministry is to place this message in preeminence in the hearts of the people because then we will have Christ himself in preeminence in a body so Satan doesn't want that to happen he'll come up with every excuse everything every doubt trying to place a question mark in your heart to God's word which the prophet said when that question mark comes in your heart to God's word death sets in so it's a life and death matter friends it's a very serious question that we're putting forth tonight now many times people get stumbled because this message was brought in such a way that they just can't recognize that it was really God you know there was that man one time you know the story he was going to be killed and so the young man grabbed a went running and he found Abraham Lincoln he says sir would you just pardon my friend's gonna be shocking grabbed a piece of paper he tore it off he wrote pardoned Abraham Lincoln he sent it back and he went running back and he said here here I got it you're pardoned you're forgiven the case is settled and he looked at it and he said on that piece of paper I there's no way if this was really from God it would come this way it would have this matter it would have this form you know what happened to that young man he died but if he could have recognized that it had been signed by supreme authority if he could have recognize that it wasn't about the paper there was a word on there that gave him life and it had been signed by the highest Authority in the land Trends don't look at the paper don't look at how it's all torn up and rugged and just kind of a ragged way look at what the message actually tells you it is life and it has been signed by supreme authority God chose to send his message through an uneducated Kentucky hillbilly his choice he sent it by a man who said umpire Empire empire instead of umpire and God will apologized to the congregation he says I'm sorry he says you know my words my pronunciation's not very good he says you know but I think after now you don't understand to kind of take me for what I mean and not what I'm saying there and he says I'm not very educated but I make a truthful Noise unto the Lord can you say Amen you know another place here I'm gonna go through a couple of things um over in the fourth seal brother random is talking about the Elijah and he says oh it was 700 that we're faithful and in the scriptures you can go see with seven thousand and question after question came was that a spiritual number were you given this was this he's like oh she's like I'm sorry friends he says I was just trying to rush right through there and I I wasn't you know making every reference and and uh but you know I appreciate the ones who broke down you know was this a spiritual thing because they knew there was something about that man that what he said was really important and so when you see something that you think might have just been a misspoken word you watch real close because God might be trying to tell you something but he was he was like oh you know I'm sorry he says I was just you know going through there and now God could have gave us a message with that one misspoken word absolutely don't limit God he can do absolutely anything he could have gave us a message without one mispronounced word without one misspoken word he could have done that but he didn't now I believe God allowed the prophet to say such things to stumble anyone who tried to figure it out by a dogmatic human intellect he put things in there where if you get somebody that's just I'm gonna figure this out and I'm gonna I'm gonna get this and they'll sit there and be like well I did I don't know what to think now sure you see it never was made for geniuses it was made for believers you know one of my favorite mistakes brother random ever made that I just love so much is over there in the questions and answers on the seals and uh he's preaching there and they asked him a question and they said uh rep is Revelations verse five and nine is this the raptured Saints and he says oh no that's not the Saints he reads it real quick and he's trying to answer another question and then he just stops he says there's something wrong there's something wrong now and that's just all there is to it there's some things happened there's something that went wrong somewhere everybody feeling all right there's no sickness or nothing somebody says go read that you know first again he goes back and reads it and he says oh here it is here it is I was wrong on that see that was redeemed us and he sees how this was the Saints he says that's right now what do you think about that oh if the presence of the Holy Ghost isn't here what is he wouldn't let see I only read the first part of that verse and just just or something wrote here and I was trying to get through looking at that clock but you see him stop me on that Glory friend this message is perfect if there was anything there that might have actually stumbled a Believer God was standing there and he was like oh hold the holder There You Gotta Straighten that word out because it might stumble a genuine believer if there's something there that might stumble human intellect I think God's just like well just let him trip right over we have a perfect message we have a word of authority we have an absolute that God came down and God Vindicated again and again and again God will not vindicate a lie to be truth he won't do it and you know friends this is an awful big statement but if you can get in the way I'm saying it if God Vindicated a lie that would make it true but all right [Music] if God says something's right that just changed the rules friends so if you could prove to me I mean prove to me that the prophet was wrong I wouldn't care first of all I wouldn't believe you but you could prove it to me and I'd say I'm sorry but God said this was right I might not be able to explain it I know I can't explain it I might not be able to understand it all I might not be able to explain it all but God came down and backed this up and he put his seal of approval on it and if I'll follow this message it'll put me in a Rapture now whatever Theory you have I don't know where that's going but I know where this is going I'm sticking with this I know the destination we have a word of authority we have an absolute it's not perfect in its grammar never promised to be that way it's not perfect in its pronunciation but it's perfect in the word it is a perfect word message God could have sent a message with perfect grammar and perfect pronunciation but he didn't want you instead God wrapped up his word in swaddling clothes and he laid it in a Manger over top of a manure pile and the world couldn't see it and Jesus rejoiced and he says father I thank thee for you have hidden these things from the wise and The Prudent and the educated and all these smart people but you've revealed it to babes you've revealed it to these babe because it was right in your sight it's hidden to everyone but the believer and to the believer that's all they can see Jesus said you're blessed if you have ears to hear time and again he would give a parable he'd cry out he that has ears to hear Let Him hear that every Church age there is a message that's given at the end of that age he says to the angel of the church that's the messenger to that age and then at the end it says and he that happened ear to hear here let him hear the message of your hour yeah there's people that are critics of the word of God there's people that are critics of the Bible brother Branham he talks about how they not only the Catholics do it he says but the Protestants too sure they do they dice it and cut it and this is inspired and that's not this is to make it fit your petty doctrines that's where the problem is friends they try to cut the word of God to fit their little petty Doctrine they say oh well this sermon this one wasn't inspired and that one he used the wrong Greek and this one trying to fit your little petty Doctrine you do not alter the Garment to fit the man you don't alter the word of God you let the man be altered to fit the garments this wedding garment is perfect now if you find a place where it doesn't fit it's not a problem with the garments you just need to lose a little extra weight or something you need to alter yourself to fit that word they try to alter it to fit their Petty doctrines brother every word of it's inspired every word of it's just as good today as it was the day that Jesus sealed the book there with his blood at Calvary every promise is yea and amen to the believer I'm not gonna read all of it but he shows where somebody was taking his tapes they play a little sentence and then they'd stop it and make him say something he didn't say he says he says now go back and play your tape he says you know that's not what I was saying he says he says uh there he says anybody knows I said that play your tape now he says whosoever shall take from it or add to it the same shall be taken from it from him it's the word of the Lord it stands that way what you just said there is that my message that I'm preaching to you it's the word of the Lord if you take one thing away from it if you add something to it then you have the same curse that's in the Book of Revelations from taking away or adding to it he says it's the word of the Lord it stands that way kind of sounds like Paul doesn't it now well we're just going to keep on going here everybody just stand up shake hands with somebody next to you make sure they're awake and we'll go a couple more minutes don't be scared if somebody's sleep just wake him up shake hands with your neighbor we got a couple more minutes we'll get through this all right you see my our worker this morning we started at 5am got up and worked in the heat today I worked part of the day and then I didn't but um so we're a little bit tired I understand you can be seated but we just got a few more minutes and uh I can't leave this half half done so we're just gonna work right through it now it's the message of the hour or death that's your options it's not one or the other it's not like halfway in halfway out there's no drunk sober man there's no black white bird it's one or the other now we have received a message that stands Vindicated by supreme authority brother man I'm here in the church agency says who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in the last stage for this last stage is going back to manifesting the pure word bride okay now to have a pure word pure word bride you have to have a pure word to have a pure word you have to have a word profit who's going to go back to manifesting this pure word bride he says he says that means we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul I will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet as surely Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day have the Capstone prophetic Ministry now this ministry has been Vindicated friends Vindicated means proved to be right all right prove to be true Vindicated we have scriptural Vindication by we could probably go into the hundreds of scriptural vindications for this last day Ministry we have the sign of of the son of man revealing himself the discernment we have that lining up thousands of times never one time was it ever proved to be wrong it was right 100 of the time and on top of that it lines up with the word of God every job until we have a Vindicated word that's been given us in this day now if you lived in a day gone by and and you came up and you said well I see what you're doing here you know Mr Noah it looks real nice but you know I've offered the lamb like Abel and Seth told me to offer it I have it offered and I really don't want to get in your boat Mr Noah is there anything wrong with the sacrifice nope but if you didn't get out of your message for that hour you died if you didn't listen to what that crazy man up on the hill was saying pounding away on that Ark for 120 years he died because well you know Mr Noah I see what you're doing here but I'm gonna my own vote there was other boats friends Robin told us everyone's like there was other boats out there there was other ideas they had on this but you either got under the message of that hour and you got in the boat the way Noah told you to get into the boat or you died you come down to to a little bit later and this man stands there and he says listen I am a son of Abraham I have been circumcised I'm a true son of Abraham I am under a promise of God I have the Covenant of God and I have a slam slain here just like we've been doing for hundreds of years that's wonderful that's wonderful but the message said you got to take and smear blood all over your door did you do it or not if you didn't follow the message for that hour it was death coming into your home friends and if in this hour you try to deviate from this message you say well I know it says that but I'm gonna do this you know I think I'm I've been baptized I'm good enough I've done this no no friends if you eat you either come under the message for your hour you either obey what the message says or it's this exactly right I don't care how much you had a slain lamp there was nothing wrong with the lamp friends the lamb was the right sacrifice it was good but without being under that message for that hour and following the word for your day it was death we're not supposed to come together to talk about the message we're to come together to get in the message and the message is Christ he's the word and we're to get in it get beneath it I like how he says it we're to get into it get beneath it we got to be underneath that word outside of that it's death now we can take this into the indictment which we're not going to where they would been sacrificing that lamb for thousands of years and it was a right sacrifice and it was good but then one day you could have been standing there you could have told them you know listen here in the temple we see what you're doing you have the sacrifice but I want to show you something you look out that window you see that man out there that naked man that's beaten beyond recognition that's dying as a criminal well you can offer 10 000 lamps but unless you accept his blood it'll never touch your life longer effective it was no longer what they needed it was a changing of dispensations and at that change of the dispensations you had to recognize that lamb that worked for you yesterday now you've come under another hour and you must get under that blood or you perish you must recognize the message for your hour it was the Fulfillment of every sacrifice that had made for thousands of years from Abel's lamb onward it was the Fulfillment of everything represented there on that cross and if they didn't recognize that it was death you must recognize where you're at Ram in recognizing your day and his message talking about that he says but did he realize speaking of the high priest but did he realize the real truth of it that he was sacrificing the very God that he claimed to be a high priest of thank you in the indictment brother random shows us how that as they crucified this message of the hour when they reject this message that was when Christ was crucified afresh and at that time he says it was a changing of dispensations and it was going from where a denominational religious Jesus which was enough for down through those Dark Ages it was enough to to go under that that denominational religious system like Martin Luther and the different ones it was enough in that hour he says but then at this second crucifixion of Christ in this indictment he says now he says from this time it's the word and the word only and then he says these words he says and that's just recently come into effect now for them that's a judgment but for us friends that means everything's available it's the word and the word only and it's all coming to effect right now and at this hour it's the manifestation of the sons of God in this hour it's the Redemption of the purchased possession right now is when men and women can walk around on this Earth as godmen it's the word now and it's in full effect the whole thing Martin Luther didn't have that friends John Wesley didn't have that but this bride has that and she will be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone word of his word life of his life Spirit of his Spirit she is him thank you now Branham in in uh I won't read it all here but if you go and you listen to that anointed ones at the end time he says you know you might have been thinking I was trying to build up myself or talk about myself and he says I'm not doing that he says this isn't me that I'm talking about because he's talking about his message and what he was saying and it sounded like he was lifting himself up kind of like the criticized Moses and he says no no it wasn't me he says I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't me what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to you don't have to understand everything in this message but you gotta surrender yourself to it it's not how much you know it's not how much knowledge you have it's what you're surrendering yourself to says he spoke through him and he goes on showing how what it was and then he makes these statement is so powerful he says the son of man his he says he says you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man this message is the body word of the son of man defeat on this is power to feed on this is rapturing Faith to feed on this is overcoming in this hour so surrender yourself to this message Surrender Your Life to this message surrender your thinking let it guide every decision in your home let it guide everything you do in your life and if the message says something don't argue with it don't try and cut it to fit your little petty Doctrine If the message preaches against mascara and fingernail polish end of discussion that's it you don't need to know anymore if if you if you decide well you know what I'm just going to stay home from church and read my Bible you're sinning the Bible says not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is and that much more as you see the day approaching brother Branham says that means going to church so you know streaming that's nice but if you stay home in your pajamas because you don't want to go to church you're sinning the assembling of yourselves together is very important because you're going to be in fellowship with people who annoy you and that's wonderful for your character all right that's another sermon we'll keep moving now you need to surrender yourself to this message with full sincerity everything that you are saying God whatever you say whatever you lead however you show me that's how I want to live my life I want to be living I want to be clothed in the word I want you to be saturated in the word I want every fiber of my being to be the word [Music] brother Graham says God hates a powerless religion it's got to have power it's got to have sincerity sincerity brings power now sincerity is wholehearted everything that's in you not a half-hearted Christianity not a halfway following this message sincerity brings power sincerity brings real worship not forms but genuine power worship oh doesn't that sound good friends genuine power worship to know that you pass from Death unto life God wants to perform his word by his power and when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word God wants to vindicate his work he wants to prove in your life you come and you stand on a promise of God and you put God on the test you say God I can see where your Prophet said this I can see where the word says is now I'm going to stand on that with everything I have and God's longing for somebody to do that he wants to come down in power and vindicate his word so stand on it bring God on the scene call on his name say you made a promise you made you said this in your word and I'm gonna stand on that because I want to see my God come down and Ash and we'll just run back down here to Jericho and wrap up the service but you know Joshua was there at Jericho and those walls was big and then walls was thick and Joshua knew everything about building walls because he did a lot of them down in Egypt and he knew how ridiculous this idea was to walk around in circles to take down a wall I mean he built walls and he'd seen walls and he probably never seen one that was this big he probably had to do some demo work and tear down a few walls and here he is and he meets with the supreme authority and that Authority says walk around in circles so they walked around in circles yeah I'm just going to do it here I like to do object lessons so you just bear with me Wesley come here but Daniel you didn't yeah come here what's up come here um do we have a couple of you how about you and well let's grab you yeah sure all right this is me very simple this isn't complicated okay I want you to all line up in a row I want you to walk around in circles around the building go ahead that way go ahead you guys feel silly yet you know and this is a church that actually knows where the story is going but he knows what happens feeling a little bit funny a little bit goofy a little bit awkward okay what about what about those those children of Israel that they're there they're marching around in circles and the people in Derek who are laughing at them they're mocking him like do you have any military plans where is your catapults where's your battering rams what's your military strategy you're just gonna walk in circles is that all you got can you imagine being the children of Israel how embarrassed they were to get up day after day after day and do the same thing and hear the same jokes and the same mockery but come on is this all you're gonna do you think we're scared of you you're just gonna walk in circles and tell what we get dizzy don't tell me they weren't embarrassed to try and stand on the word for their hour oh sure they were but they did it you know why would they listen to Joshua anyway well you know they just seen him Vindicated the same way Moses was because he said you start walking towards that water and when they walk towards that water the Jordan River just parted into and they crossed right over France if the word says walk then walk whatever it says you just do it if it says to walk you walk if it says that by his stripes you're healed then that settles the question if he says testify of your healing and testify of your healing whatever the word says you do it I don't care how ridiculous it is I don't want to go to church I'm going to sit next to that guy that's got body odor hey sorry that's what we're doing you know that guy that was in front of me in line he kept kicking me and he kept stirring up dust and it was getting in my nose I don't want to do this again no we're going again the Bible Joshua said we're going to do it again and we're going to do it again today friends just keep doing it keep living that simple humble Christian Life just keep standing on the word keep confessing his promises keep confessing that what God Said is the truth you boys I'm not gonna make you 13 times you can find your seats now they did this again and again they were so embarrassed they were so ashamed to be like yeah that's that's our leader there that's the one we're following that's our military captain and his plan is to walk around in circles but the word said to do it and they did it and you know what happened when they followed that word and they did it every way exactly the way God said do it and they'd March around that wall seven times on that last day when they got to that last time then God came down and Vindicated the word he gave to his prophet and those walls of Jericho Came Crashing to the ground The Impossible became a reality when they obeyed God's word to the letter and they just did what God Said do it didn't feel very exciting friends many times going to church it doesn't it didn't feel very glorious or very military or proud or whatever they wanted that's what God Said do and God came down and Vindicated his message to them but you're gonna have times when you go through those dry spells when you're just Marching In Circles here we go again here we go again just keep walking the word said walk can you walk Bram says this he says look at Joshua before one rock came down out of the walls of Jericho Joshua walked around the walls shouting the victory for by faith he saw the victory he knowed the walls were coming down and he armed his man and walked around and around and around Jericho for seven days in full armor what doing because he was looking at the Unseen it was a promise a God made how much can you walk around a wheelchair how much can you walk around the cancer how much can you walk around sin shouting the victory that God gives the promise when you can see him who is invisible when that pulsation come down in your heart begins to pull say I'm the Lord who heals all thy diseases when you can see that everything else weakens away Joshua looked at the Unseen and he walked around the walls of Jericho believing it would happen it all depends on what you're looking at so friends Set Your Eyes Upon an absolute Set Your Eyes Upon what the word of God has said in this hour and follow it whatever it says you do that if you see Joshua's marching in this way if you see the prophets going that way then getting stepped behind him follow her right in line with him because he got his marching orders from the captain of the host of the Lord the musicians would come tonight hey just to stand to our feet we're following a Vindicated message we're following a word of authority it is the absolute for it's not the words of a man it's the unfailing body word of the son of man you want victory in your life surrender to this message you want to see God come down in power you just do what the word says do and you see if God doesn't come down and vindicate it amen we were at the Youth Camp there in Ohio just a couple a week ago or so and one little thing the Lord just dropped in my heart and the services for me personally and because you know as a minister I want I want to be used of God I want God to use me and I want to do things that will help people but I can't do it myself I'd love to but I can't but I want to see God use me to help people and so I I'm like okay I guess I have to pray three hours every day and then I'll be dedicated enough that God can use me and prayer is wonderful and I need to do it more you all do it's one thing you can't do too much of I'll get in my mind it's kind of a complex if I can just be dedicated enough then God can use me if I can just and I built up this this mindset and those things are good and I need more dedication certainly but what God spoke to my heart they were talking about Samson the brother was preaching there about Samson and and I just realized here's Samson in Gaza he's sleeping with a harlot he wakes up in the middle of the night walks out of her house goes to the city Gates and a miracle takes place and I'm just like that don't work in my own mathematics like he'd have to have a five hour prayer meeting before he could even do anything and the little thing the Lord drops into my heart was it's not what you achieve it's what you surrender yourself to seen Sampson had one thing that was surrendered to God that was his strength and God could use Samson's strength to do things that no man could do and if we can just surrender ourselves what an achievement it's a surrendering if we can just surrender ourselves to God God can come down and do things that no man could do [Music] let us surrender ourselves Jesus Christ the manifested word in this hour and let him do things in our life that we could never do let him have preeminence [Music] let's sing this [Music] [Music] the more that I can humble myself the more he lifts me up every day I live Lord I love you more it's the more that I surrendered the more [Music] release my care the more you take control the more that I don't humble myself the more he lifts me up every day I live Lord I love you more [Music] [Music] and he cares for you and through sunshine [Applause] [Music] for you let's sing that one more time this evening and he cares for you yes he cares for you and through sunshine [Applause] [Music] can we make that personal this evening he cares for me amen do you believe it he cared for me oh he cares for me [Music] and through [Music] sunshine or foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I Just Want to Thank You Lord for letting me hear your word and I just want to thank you Lord for letting me hear
