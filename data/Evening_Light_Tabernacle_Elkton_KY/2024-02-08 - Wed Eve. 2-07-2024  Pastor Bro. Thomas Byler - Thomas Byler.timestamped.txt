[34:09] it because you'll never touch a fourth
[34:12] of what what what it all encumbers amen

[39:27] when I begin to think this I thought
[39:28] about how blessed that we are amen and
[39:33] so tonight's subject is bless it I've
[39:35] spoken on it before but that's okay
[39:38] isn't it how many believ that we're
[39:42] [Applause]
[39:43] blessed in my mind after looking at some
[39:46] of these things I highly doubt whether
[39:49] we uh recognize half of how blessed we
[39:53] really
[39:55] are
[39:58] amen
[40:00] amen very blessed
[40:03] people amen now how many knows uh where
[40:07] blessings come
[40:11] from amen even if you go to heaven they
[40:14] call it the land of the
[40:16] blessed that right that blessed Promised
[40:20] Land the land of the blessed and the and
[40:24] the land of the Damned or the cursed
[40:28] amen that's where people will end up
[40:30] either one or the other but I got to
[40:33] thinking in my mind I got to thinking
[40:34] Lord you have been so good you have been
[40:38] so good to me you are so good to your
[40:42] people
[40:44] amen amen when you think about what the
[40:48] believer possesses what God has blessed
[40:52] you
[40:53] with amen let me say first of all
[40:57] talking about where blessings come from
[40:59] in Revelations 5 and verse 12 those
[41:01] 10,000s times 10,000s and verse verse 12
[41:05] says they were saying with a loud voice
[41:08] Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
[41:11] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[41:17] strength and honor and glory and
[41:22] blessing amen how many believer you know
[41:25] cuz a lot of time we get weak we get so
[41:27] but people don't recognize that whenever
[41:30] God gives he should get something in
[41:35] return don't you think whenever God
[41:38] blesses you you ought to get blessing
[41:40] back my my when you look at the scope of
[41:43] this it is pretty far and
[41:47] wide but he's worthy of blessing and
[41:50] honor and strength one place the Bible
[41:52] says you know that we are to love the
[41:54] Lord your God with all of your strength
[41:57] all of your mind all of your soul is
[42:00] that right all of your heart love him
[42:03] with all of it because he's worthy of it
[42:08] amen I've got wrote down here first of
[42:11] all God has given the believer what's he
[42:13] what what he's blessed us with amen he
[42:16] has given us access according to Hebrews
[42:18] the third chapter that we have access
[42:21] unto God by
[42:23] faith amen
[42:27] we have access amen into the blessings
[42:29] of God by faith and we know that even
[42:32] faith is the blessing of
[42:35] God Amen even faith is a blessing of God
[42:38] it causes you to have access to it and
[42:41] when you come into that world and into
[42:43] that realm amen it that Faith brings you
[42:46] to the power of the Holy Spirit it
[42:48] brings you to God gives you a power over
[42:51] your
[42:53] enemy amen how how many's glad to have
[42:57] your enemy under your feet demons that
[43:01] torment people how many believe that
[43:03] torment is not you don't you aren't Tor
[43:06] you know how many people are tormented
[43:08] out there they're tormented Demons of
[43:12] Torment that's what demons do they're
[43:14] Demons of Torment they torment people
[43:16] but you and I we aren't tormented
[43:21] tonight B Better B at one place blessed
[43:24] means happy
[43:28] happy oh my we got to be the what the
[43:32] Most Blessed the most happiest people on
[43:35] the face of the
[43:38] [Music]
[43:39] earth I think of where we're coming to
[43:42] we think of a persecution that's coming
[43:46] huh persecution that's coming we don't
[43:49] know just what'll happen yet do we we'll
[43:52] have to wait and
[43:53] see but we know that what we we come out
[43:56] of just a couple hundred years ago was
[43:59] brutal we as Christians did not have
[44:02] what we have today we lived in dens and
[44:05] caves of the earth and lost our lives 68
[44:08] million give their lives brutally
[44:11] slaughtered killed in the most terrible
[44:15] way hey they didn't get to have houses
[44:19] oh my think about this my they have get
[44:23] to have lands and and have it like you
[44:25] and I
[44:27] we're blessed to be able to be us free
[44:29] and have the things that you
[44:31] [Music]
[44:33] do you know what I what I come to the
[44:36] conclusion is that a lot of times we are
[44:39] we're not thankful like we ought to be
[44:41] we don't praise God like we should
[44:44] because we don't recognize or think
[44:47] about the blessings that God has
[44:48] bestowed upon
[44:50] you but just seing about what how he's
[44:53] blessed you and how good he's been does
[44:56] something to
[44:58] me it should
[45:01] should I do I refuse to be ungrateful
[45:05] unth
[45:07] thankful for the blessings of
[45:14] God all right let's go down that
[45:16] road minute let's talk about
[45:23] it talk about the kind of people first
[45:25] of all
[45:26] the kind of people that don't give God
[45:28] the honor and the glory that's due to
[45:29] his name as far as I'm concerned they're
[45:32] vessels of Dishonor vessels fitted for
[45:36] Destruction huh all that God has done
[45:39] for them all the blessing he they spit
[45:41] in his
[45:43] face they're worthy of Destruction ain't
[45:46] that
[45:47] right in the Book of Romans we want to
[45:49] look at a group
[45:51] there of people who are unth thankful
[45:54] for the blessings of
[45:56] God
[45:58] amen amen and you
[46:02] know God doesn't much appreciate
[46:07] unthankfulness
[46:10] amen he really
[46:12] don't all right let me see here Romans
[46:17] 1 and we'll begin
[46:19] with verse 20 for the invisible things
[46:22] of him from the creation of the world
[46:24] are clearly seen being understood by the
[46:26] things that are made even his eternal
[46:29] power and godhead so that they are
[46:32] without excuse because that when they
[46:34] knew God
[46:37] huh these people knew
[46:40] God they once knew
[46:44] God but they glorified him not as
[46:48] God in other words they didn't give him
[46:50] the honor they didn't bless God at all
[46:53] times a person that's always praising
[46:56] God for things they're a different type
[46:58] of
[47:00] person neither listen they glorified him
[47:03] not as God and neither were thankful
[47:05] there were a bunch of unthankful
[47:08] people ungrateful people how manyan we
[47:13] live in a country of ungrateful
[47:18] people you think about these young
[47:21] people and so forth and the riots and
[47:23] the unthankfulness of why they un
[47:25] thankful and then we've got the Border
[47:27] 5,000 more people trying to come and get
[47:31] a piece of what they got and they don't
[47:33] even know what they
[47:35] got they don't even realize they do not
[47:37] appreciate what they got but you don't
[47:39] appreciate what you got you're going to
[47:41] lose what you
[47:43] got you're going to get away from that's
[47:45] a problem man I don't care where it is
[47:48] when people oh
[47:50] my him I didn't mean to go here this
[47:52] quick but it goes for every aspect of
[47:54] our life
[48:00] amen you take a
[48:04] marriage amen I'm going to stop and
[48:07] finish my thought here and go over into
[48:08] Jude and then we'll get into it Lord
[48:09] willing all right they were not thankful
[48:14] but became vain became that way they
[48:17] were once this way now they became vain
[48:20] in their imagination and their foolish
[48:22] heart was
[48:24] darkened let me tell you something when
[48:26] you become unthankful and ungrateful and
[48:28] worship God the way that you should your
[48:31] heart gets
[48:35] darker amen professing themselves to be
[48:38] wise they became
[48:39] fools and changed the glory of The
[48:42] Incorruptible God into an image made
[48:44] unto corruptible man and of birds and of
[48:46] forfo footed beasts and of creeping
[48:49] things my my my isn't about what theyve
[48:52] become a bunch of kittens in school
[48:54] bunch of dogs in school and everything
[48:59] else my gracious wherefore God has also
[49:02] gave them
[49:04] up to uncleanness through the lust of
[49:07] their own Hearts to dishonor their own
[49:09] bodies between themselves who change the
[49:12] truth of God into a lie and worship and

[49:39] things amen rather than god
[49:45] notice to this listen God gave them up
[49:48] the cleaness through the lust of their

[50:41] likewise also the men leaving the
[50:42] natural use of the woman burned in their
[50:44] own lust one Tower to another and even
[50:47] man with men working that which is
[50:49] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[50:52] that recompense of reward of eror which
[50:54] was meat even as they did not like to
[50:57] retain God in their knowledge God gave
[51:00] them over to a reprobate mind to do to
[51:03] things which are not
[51:08] convenient amen people who wants know
[51:12] God all the way to this
[51:16] bad how many knows that man Humanity has
[51:20] a way of backsliding and slipping away

[52:40] right why unth thankful they don't
[52:43] realize the blessing that they
[52:45] [Applause]
[52:47] have is that the truth that's right
[52:53] M let's look at that
[52:55] look at another
[52:57] group over in the book of
[53:01] Jude it talks about in verse 16 it says
[53:04] these are murmurers and
[53:08] complainers walking after their own
[53:12] lusts a that right people that aren't
[53:16] happy huh I mean there people that
[53:18] aren't
[53:20] happy they don't aren't thankful for
[53:22] their blessings that they have
[53:32] when I think
[53:34] about if you really have Christ in your
[53:37] heart youve got God in your
[53:40] heart we'll get more into it you are a
[53:43] blessed
[53:46] person
[53:48] amen that's right what are these
[53:51] people these people that it's talking
[53:55] about these people they are these are
[53:58] murmurers and complainers walking after
[54:01] their own lusts and so
[54:04] forth it talks about way back it starts
[54:09] with I will verse five I will therefore
[54:12] have put you in remembrance though you
[54:13] once knew this how that the Lord having
[54:16] saved the people out of the land of
[54:18] Egypt afterwards destroy them that
[54:21] believe
[54:24] not
[54:28] amen how many knows God gave Israel
[54:30] every chance in the
[54:32] world 10 or 11 chances I think it was 10
[54:35] different 10 or 11 different times that
[54:37] God had mercy on him different times he
[54:40] uh he was going to just say Moses just
[54:41] separate yourself and I'll wipe the
[54:43] whole thing off can you imagine if Moses
[54:46] wouldn't have come in there the whole
[54:47] the whole lot would have been extinct it
[54:50] would have been just naan and car being
[54:53] swallowed up got to WIP the ball
[55:01] it's a terrible thing to be a
[55:03] non-believer it's a terrible thing to
[55:05] disbelieve God after he has proven
[55:07] himself to
[55:09] you oh my how many know I don't think
[55:12] that we're sufficiently impressed this
[55:14] evening amen with the fact that you
[55:16] don't have to wonder about what your
[55:19] religion is right or not we have the
[55:21] message amen where Jesus himself would
[55:24] come down and prove that what he said
[55:26] was right and that ought to mean the
[55:28] world to us it means everything the
[55:31] budha don't have none of those world
[55:33] religions you are blessed above all the
[55:35] religions of the world you've got the
[55:38] proof that Jesus Christ amen that what
[55:40] you following his right Jesus would come
[55:42] down and Vindicated Time and Time and
[55:45] Time After Time don't I wish the world
[55:48] could hear that Jesus would come there
[55:50] prove
[55:52] it how many know it's the Pentecostals
[55:54] they got so used to
[55:56] it that's the problem people get so used
[56:00] to it every little blessing of God
[56:03] becomes so common to
[56:06] people till they no time they're
[56:09] complaining they're murmuring they're
[56:11] not satisfied with
[56:15] it
[56:17] amen my my my we won't go too much but
[56:20] he talks about Israel afterwards and
[56:22] even the angels and which kept not their
[56:26] first estate but left their own
[56:27] habitation the angels in heaven had the
[56:30] same problem of letting it become common
[56:33] to
[56:37] them there's a lot of message preachers
[56:39] or preachers I don't know about message
[56:40] preach that have went beyond brother
[56:45] bam they think they
[56:53] have my
[56:57] the tapes are old they get tired of
[56:59] listen to that same message again and
[57:01] again and again and again and

[1:05:31] dignities
[1:05:33] M remember he's talking about certain
[1:05:36] men verse four that have come in crept
[1:05:38] in
[1:05:39] unawares who before of old are ordained
[1:05:42] to this condemnation ungodly men turning
[1:05:45] the grace of our God into
[1:05:49] lasciviousness and denying the only Lord
[1:05:51] God and our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:54] amen listen even Michael the Archangel
[1:05:57] when contending with the devil he
[1:05:58] disputed about the body of Moses thirst
[1:06:00] not ring against him ailing accusation
[1:06:02] but said the Lord reuk you but these
[1:06:04] speak evil of things which they know not
[1:06:06] how many believ that child of God they
[1:06:07] got a what you my mouth but that they
[1:06:10] know naturally as brue priests in those
[1:06:13] things they corrupt themselves them for
[1:06:15] they have gone in the way of Cain and
[1:06:17] ran greedily after the air of B for
[1:06:19] reward it perished in gain saying of
[1:06:23] Kora these are spots in your feasts of
[1:06:26] Charity when they Feast with you
[1:06:28] uhoh the people sometimes right amongst
[1:06:32] you watch
[1:06:34] out would it be okay watch out for the
[1:06:37] make believer in the
[1:06:39] church watch
[1:06:40] out he ain't got so much watch out for
[1:06:43] the
[1:06:44] unbeliever nah but to make
[1:06:48] believer it's lie sneaky just so a
[1:06:53] little seed
[1:06:54] Discord clouds they are without water
[1:06:57] carried about winds whose trees whose
[1:06:59] fruit withered without fruit twice dead
[1:07:02] plucked up by the roots Raging Waves of
[1:07:04] the sea foaming up their own chain
[1:07:06] wondering stars to whom is reserved the
[1:07:09] Blackness and darkness forever and Enoch
[1:07:11] also the sabath from Adam prophesied
[1:07:13] saying behold the Lord cometh with 10
[1:07:15] thousands of his
[1:07:17] Saints to execute judgment upon all and
[1:07:19] to convince all that are ungodly among
[1:07:21] them of all their deeds which they have
[1:07:24] L committed and of all their hard
[1:07:25] speeches which ungod Sinners have spoken
[1:07:29] against them we touched a little bit on
[1:07:30] that in the last sermon these are
[1:07:32] murmurers and complainers think about it
[1:07:36] these are people that don't give God the
[1:07:38] glory the
[1:07:40] blessing the
[1:07:43] praise all stooped all the way down to
[1:07:49] complaining how many knows murmuring and
[1:07:52] complaining is a way low it's way down
[1:07:56] there if you're doing that you're way
[1:07:58] down
[1:08:00] there didn't Israel murmur and complain
[1:08:03] and God sends fiery serpents among them
[1:08:05] because of their
[1:08:09] complaining
[1:08:10] oh my here's another one I jotted down
[1:08:14] when the Holy Spirit kind of sing me
[1:08:15] talk about Job how many know job was a
[1:08:18] rich
[1:08:19] man he had lands he had more oxen and
[1:08:22] sheep and uh man camels Gore he had all
[1:08:27] oh man a wonderful group of family he
[1:08:29] had a portrait of all nine of his
[1:08:31] children and these are my beautiful
[1:08:34] wonderful children God's been so
[1:08:37] good but you know one thing about job is
[1:08:40] he didn't get
[1:08:43] laed and stop praying every morning he
[1:08:47] would pray for his children offer and
[1:08:49] sacrifice for himself in case my
[1:08:52] children sin Lord please forgive them
[1:08:54] every parent wants to pray that for
[1:08:56] their children Lord if my children have
[1:08:57] sinned forgive them would you Lord like
[1:09:00] I do the church men Lord if there's any
[1:09:02] sin if any anybody has committed
[1:09:03] anything Lord forgive them Lord when we
[1:09:05] come in those doors we want everything
[1:09:07] here so the Holy Spirit can just Flow
[1:09:09] Free Lord forgive him make a sacrifice
[1:09:12] and God goes
[1:09:13] and he takes everything away from
[1:09:17] him
[1:09:19] huh kills his children takes all of his
[1:09:22] financial things man left him with
[1:09:25] nothing and what did he do he blessed
[1:09:29] the Lord
[1:09:31] anyway it did not cause job in all of
[1:09:34] his
[1:09:35] distress to stop blessing the Lord he
[1:09:38] said the lord gave the Lord take it away
[1:09:40] blessed be the name of the
[1:09:42] Lord how many believe bless God in all
[1:09:46] times in the good times blessed are you
[1:09:49] and Men shall revile you and persecute
[1:09:52] you Peter said man if you are suffer
[1:09:55] wrongfully and so forth you're blessed
[1:09:57] and you re receive a
[1:09:59] blessing you receive a blessing when
[1:10:02] people do bad to you and you receive a
[1:10:04] blessing when people do good to you as a
[1:10:07] Christian how many know you oh man
[1:10:11] you're just plain
[1:10:13] blessed I am am
[1:10:16] bless I am blessed every day that I live
[1:10:21] I am
[1:10:22] happy when I wake up in the morning when
[1:10:25] I lay my head to rest I am blessed I am
[1:10:29] blessed
[1:10:32] amen all right what else do
[1:10:36] we
[1:10:39] for now one more illustration before I
[1:10:42] want to go and read some of these other
[1:10:44] things and I want to talk to you about
[1:10:46] another class of people that got away
[1:10:50] from God
[1:10:52] Amen and that was the Ephesian Church
[1:10:56] age isn't that right they begin to get
[1:11:01] LAX it says they've got
[1:11:05] laxed that's what Ephesus means
[1:11:07] relaxed and
[1:11:10] drifting
[1:11:14] amen he said had something against him
[1:11:17] nevertheless I have somewhat against the
[1:11:18] because thou H has left thy first love
[1:11:26] amen how many believe you don't want to
[1:11:28] lose your love you don't want to lose
[1:11:29] your love for your wife want to lose
[1:11:30] your love for your husband you don't
[1:11:32] want to lose your love for God when you
[1:11:34] lose your love look
[1:11:36] out these people had lost their first
[1:11:40] love to understand this must you must
[1:11:42] realize that the spirit is not speaking
[1:11:44] to the original Saints at Ephesus alone
[1:11:46] but the whole span of the 120 years it's
[1:11:49] message then it's all the generation he
[1:11:51] says Now history keeps repeating itself
[1:11:53] in one a
[1:11:55] generation in the generations of Israel
[1:11:57] we see a Revival in one generation and
[1:12:00] only see the fires fading in the next
[1:12:03] and in the third generation only Embers
[1:12:06] were slightly
[1:12:09] glowing but in the fourth there may not
[1:12:11] be any vest whatsoever of the original
[1:12:14] flame then God lights the fire
[1:12:18] again and the same process is
[1:12:21] repeated it's simply the manif ation of
[1:12:23] the truth that God has no
[1:12:26] grandchildren how many believe that that
[1:12:27] applies to the message folks I don't
[1:12:29] care
[1:12:30] how on mess's Pew benches you've got to
[1:12:34] have a genuine personal
[1:12:38] experience with all Mighty
[1:12:41] God Amen he says salvation is not passed
[1:12:44] on just by natural birth anymore amen is
[1:12:47] that that there is to a Apostolic
[1:12:50] succession listen listen you start out
[1:12:54] with truly Born Again Believers and when
[1:12:56] the next Generation comes along they are
[1:12:58] no longer just plain Christians amen but
[1:13:01] they have taken some denominational name
[1:13:04] amen the fervent desire to please God
[1:13:07] the to know him and his and word the cry
[1:13:10] for reaching out in the spirit all
[1:13:12] begins to
[1:13:14] fade and instead of that church being on
[1:13:16] fire with the fire of God it has cooled
[1:13:19] off and become a bit
[1:13:22] formal
[1:13:28] [Applause]
[1:13:30] my my
[1:13:32] mind this is what H happened back there
[1:13:35] to the Ephesians they were getting a bit
[1:13:37] formal the abandonment to God was dying
[1:13:41] out and the people weren't too careful
[1:13:43] about what God thought of them as they
[1:13:45] were beginning to careful about the
[1:13:46] world thought of them the second
[1:13:48] generation come along was just like is
[1:13:51] they demanded a king to be like other
[1:13:53] nations when they did that they rejected
[1:13:55] God but they did it anyway that's the
[1:13:58] history of the
[1:13:59] church when it thinks more of conforming
[1:14:02] to the world instead of conforming to
[1:14:03] God isn't long until they see them
[1:14:05] stopping doing the things they used to
[1:14:06] do and start doing things they wouldn't
[1:14:10] do
[1:14:11] initially
[1:14:12] amen they change their manner of dress
[1:14:15] their attitudes their
[1:14:17] behavior amen hello they get locks now
[1:14:22] that cycle of Revival of death has never
[1:14:25] failed all you have to do is recall the
[1:14:28] in the spirit when men and women Dr like
[1:14:30] Christians went to church prayed all
[1:14:31] night took in street corners weren't
[1:14:33] ashamed of the manifestation of the
[1:14:35] spirit they left their old dead churches
[1:14:37] and worshiped in homes and store and
[1:14:39] buildings they had
[1:14:42] reality see how that first church man
[1:14:44] they begin to get away from God and how
[1:14:46] many know it got colder and colder until
[1:14:49] they were completely away from
[1:14:52] God
[1:14:55] I said to that and when I thought about
[1:14:57] that I thought how blessed you
[1:15:04] are
[1:15:06] according to the
[1:15:10] cycle Danny you should be quiet as a
[1:15:13] mouse just amen yeah brother R I guess
[1:15:18] that's

[1:15:27] much to say nothing I didn't know
