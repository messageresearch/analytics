TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh [Music] so so morning brothers and sisters if you'll just stand with us this morning i'm gonna go before the lord in prayer dear lord jesus we come before you dear lord this morning dear lord believing you were dear lord where two or three gathered you said there that you'd be in their midst your lord pray you be with every portion of the service dear lord we don't we know dear lord that

are recovering from sickness dear lord and once again dear lord anoint here to hear dear lord and speaker to speak we ask these things in jesus name amen children can be dismissed to sunday school and if we'll go in the psalms to psalms 113. psalms 113. praise he the lord praise o you servants of the lord praise the name of the lord from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the lord's name is to be praised who is like unto the lord our god who dwelleth on high he raises up raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth the needy out of the dung hill and this one together he maketh the barren women to keep house and to be joyful mother of children praise ye the lord for the brine you may be seated good morning brothers and sisters if you would uh turn with me to galatians the fifth chapter but there's a scripture in there on that psalm we were reading this morning it says who has like unto the lord our god who dwelleth on high will humble himself to behold the things that are in the heaven and in the earth you know but you know the thing i was thinking about what people don't believe in the day that we live in is that god that's in heaven right now is in the hearts of his people and when they see the things you're doing for him they can't believe that it's god manifested to him what they're seeing they can't believe that they when they think of god they think of up here they don't ever think of them down here on the heart and a lot of times they give you struggles they give you they fuss with you they just can't believe that god can take over the desires take over the heart of a man or woman and lead them and be his representative on the face of the earth i i was also going to mention some of you are already starting to notice that uh our electric company has raised their rate so it's been a long time since i've had a 500 dollar plus electric bill since i put mostly leds in the church it's been a long time since the bill's been that high in the summertime i think it was like 530 540 so um we should be alright if we get through this month it's supposed to cool off we'll be back down to the normal you know most of the year if the electric bill has never been a dollars a month it kind of surprised me there being that high hadn't been that way even last summer when it was a little warm it never got that hot i was gonna go to this message this morning i hope i marked my spot you know i was thinking also you know we live in a weak age i mean people i don't take this personally but people are just weak the things that 60 years ago a hundred years ago people used to suffer and endure and not complain and just put their head down and that they knew it was part of life they're not that way anymore this day and age they complain about everything whether it's air conditioning whether it's heat whether it's too warm it's too cold people can't be happy i mean christians should be the happiest people around the world but it just seems strange she said people just don't have peace they're just not happy in the state that they're at you know it could be worse i always say that to him it could be worse but uh i'm going to start here at um at about the about the 13th verse here i know i read this chapter in galatians a lot but i was thinking this morning a lot of times in as christians god is just simply asking us to be who he made us to be simply be the manner or woman that god made you to be just be sweet just be loving just be caring in everything you do and let christ manifest himself through your heart and life and everything that you do and if you'll just let go and let god have his way that's what he'll do in your heart and in your life let me just read this this morning you know i was sitting in my office for a couple hours this morning and it was just blank you know after a busy week but you know you can get so busy in the personal things that you forget to do the things of god but uh let me start at this uh i'm trying to figure out a good place to start here at the 12th of so i would have you even cut off that which trouble you for brethren you have been called undeliberally only use not your liberty for occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled one word even this the thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself and sometimes i i know that can be hard to do but that's the simple truth there do you love people like you love yourself or everyone knows who you are i was i wrote some notes down here i was just thinking uh especially for young men and young women you know you're you're born with with morality you're born with knowing right from wrong and as you move further on in life as you get older and older and older you your enemy is going to make you want to compromise that integrity and that honesty that you're born with as you get older and older and older and you'll get to a position in your life where you're going to have to choose to walk the right path to walk the wrong path and it can be so easily that he just tries to convince you you know the way i was thinking this morning it's like who you work with i don't everyone has different jobs but when you work with people there's always that person that's trying to get you to compromise your integrity and your honesty he's always trying to get you to do something that you know that is wrong that you shouldn't do and he's gonna push you and push you and push you until you either say no or you surrender and that's just like your enemy this morning in the things that you do in the in your life he's going to push you and push you and push you and push you so he realizes you're going to stand firm in what god taught you and what you know that is right and they're they're watching you both in a physical and a spiritual sense watching you to see you make that first mistake and after you make that first mistake when then they're going to push you to make the second mistake and then make the third mistake and before you know it they're bringing all your mistakes up to you and it's and that's why you want to be in a position where you don't make i know we all make mistakes but you don't want to make that first mistake you want to stay true to your lord but let me i'm all over the place this morning but the law fulfilled in one word even this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you bite and devour one another take heed at least you be consumed one another that's really true for the day that we live and you get around people you don't understand how they live sometimes all they do is fuss and talk bad about other people never looking at their own lives i mean that's just the state of the age that we live in but and he goes on this i say then walk in the spirit that you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh these are contrary one to another so that you cannot do the things that you would but be led of the spirit and you are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these and i'm not going to read them all you can read them yourself there's a lot of things that you see there that are wrong but if you're in christ you'll flee these things all these things that you see going on in the world and as you drop down he says here which i have told you before and as i've told you in the time past them that which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god and it hasn't changed for 2022. if you're doing such things you're not going to inherit the kingdom of god no matter what your enemy is telling you it's just truth but this is what we all want to represent in our hearts and lives and it says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance and such there's no law if they that are in that they that are christ have crucified the flesh which the affections and lust but if you live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit and let us not be desirous of vainglory provoking one another to envy and i was gonna i hope i didn't take this out here but god simply wants us to be christians in the day that we live it might be a hard thing to be in the day that we live but it he that's all he wants you to do is just be who you are in christ not something that you're not supposed to be but i was going to read this here you know you all probably know this brother branham taught it a lot god hates a manufacturer he hates a person that isn't when you see him he's not the real person that he really is that you know if you're manufacturing something that you're not that's not what god wants you to be this morning he wants to be what he's leading you to be if you have to manufacture your christianity or you you have to manufacture this or manufacture that and everything that you do in life you're you don't have no foundation you just naturally become what god wants you to be you can't manufacture it after a while people will start realizing that you're manufacturing and uh i'll start this is in this uh the day on calvary i'll just read a few quotes here and then sit down before i go off on another tangent here uh i was reading this this morning yeah this is what brother brown i was just thinking in the age that we're living everyone wants to be everyone wants a trophy everyone wants to be tapped on the back saying they're doing a good job to a point out where it's a crazy thing in the age that we live you know a lot of i was always raised i can't speak for anyone else just doing a good job and doing the right thing should have been enough i was always taught from my own father that just doing the right thing at the right time was enough you didn't have to have someone telling you that what you did was okay you just know in your heart that doing a good job and doing the right thing at the right time was its own reward but that's not how people are today but i'll just read what he has to say here now say you know i'll start here he was talking about this widow how he would had given cole cole to her but i'll start at this last part of this hundred and second paragraph says bless god i'm a christian all mine you selfish poor miserable person you're a hypocrite so basically saying if you're telling everyone else what you're doing for other people then you're a hypocrite you should not let your right hand know what your left hand is doing and this is what he says here don't let your right hand know what your left hand is doing and the left know what the right is doing just so i automatically dead and cries till you do it and that's what i'm trying to say if you're dead in christ you're just going to do the right thing because it's the right thing to do do it now anywhere your life's nature it's your makeup you do it anyhow it's just the life that lives in you you're completely yielded to the spirit and you just live it lives itself in you or you feel that blessed spirit not life not me that liveth said paul but christ that live within me just so automatic it goes back to what i said earlier you can't manufacture it you just got to live it and believe it and it'll show itself through you if you just let go and he goes on to say well i tell you brother brown and we are christians here we help these people we help them people oh my shame oh you that's not christianity christianity you automatically got it got you it's to be done and you just you just forget about it all about it ain't go do it christ was completely surrendered to his life to god he gave himself a public servant to the people he gave his life freely he didn't have to do it he didn't regurgitally do it he didn't say now brethren you ought to think a whole lot of me because i'm come to die for you he never said a word about it he died anyhow because it was god in him and if god's in you and if god's in me he'll make us look at others sheep on one side and one of them will say lord well i did this and lord i did that he'll say depart from me you work as of nebuti i never knew you if the church can ever come to these fundamental facts that it's not something you try to do or you work up yourself to do it's something that you're born born in you and that's what i'm trying to say we just got to be what god wants us to be this morning whatever that is whether it's a preacher a teacher whatever god's chosen you chosen for you to be like brother bradham said whatever that is that's what you need to do and you just need to move forward and do it the best way you can you know and the day we live that's not what the way they teach you anymore but you should be the best at anything that you do you shouldn't be satisfied being mediocre whether it's a christian whatever it is you know you never get ahead being mediocre in anything and he goes on to say depart from me you worked as an iniquity i never knew you if the church can ever come to these fundamental facts and it's not something you try to do you work yourself up to do it's something that's born in born in you well i could keep on reading and not stop but i was just simply thinking this morning i was telling jeanette i was as i was trying i'm not trying to be funny you know the the workers were out in the tobacco fields yesterday and what was it 100 and 510 high ball temperature they're out there oiling that tobacco i'm not saying they were having a great time but you know they were working in the middle of the day three or four o'clock in the afternoon when it was the hottest doing their job they might not have liked it i'm not saying they like it and i was just thinking thursday and friday i'm working around people that are in the air-conditioned room at 78 degrees and are complaining that it's too hot that my point being is no matter what circumstances you find yourself in you just got to relax and let god have his way in it whether it's too hot or it's too cold whether it's not the way you want it to be that's that's not our lot in life our lot in life is to be what god wants us to be and just walk in that brother josh good morning amen listening that song i'm living by faith in jesus above let's stand this morning i care not today what tomorrow may bring little shadow or sunshine or rain

blood he loved the air [Music] he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood i heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealing how he made the lame to walk again and caused the blind

it doesn't keep the bride from rejoicing sickness is going around and the world's falling apart but the bride's rejoicing more than she's ever rejoiced why because my god is the god of the impossible when you don't think there's a way he puts it together when you don't think there's an answer he has an answer when you think it's fell apart if there's no cure for anything he has a cure amen thank the musicians thank brother tom for asking us i hate that he's sick i'd rather him be here you know i just always enjoy his friendship his fellowship and uh if we can try to help bear the burden we're going to try to bear the burden this morning so that one little scripture and then it'll quote and then we'll be seated but in proverbs 18 verse 10 and i don't even have the scripture yet hey man i was enjoying the singing appreciate all the saying and just about got happy back there so i forgot to flip over my scriptures so proverbs 18 and verse 10. amen you love him this morning and he's truly been good to us the message god's chosen place of worship in 25 brother brennan makes his comment he says now notice god has promised to meet his worshipers in these in this and only this one place and that is of his choosing not of our choosing not of our thinking but of his thinking his choosing and said it would be a place where he put his name where he chose so we find out where he put his name and where he chose and it's by his own choosing now that we have found the place he put his name that is in christ jesus let me be a jesus man he said there is no other place there is no other name are you satisfied with that and the congregation says i mean he says now the thing of it is is if we find where that place is the worship place is nowhere now we are accepted only in christ it is in the name of jesus it is in his name that's all i want he said you go all of these directions but it all comes back to the name of jesus jesus amen in proverbs 18 verse 10 very very very common scripture but it says the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and it's safe the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it in his faith heavenly father lord we truly love you this morning lord we appreciate you lord and all that you've done and continue to do for us and we asked you this morning for your blessings upon this service all those that are sick that can't make it lord we send your holy spirit to them lord and to the lord mend their bodies lord and drive back the symptoms of this sickness lord that they could be back in fellowship worshiping around those of light precious faith lord we ask you to come take control this morning walk up and down each owl lord touch each heart lord speak to us with your divine promise and thy lovely name we pray amen and amen and you'll be seated this morning and we'll just go right into the thought on my head and you know it's uh sometimes you know i come down the road and i ask my kids and tabitha come with me my middle daughter's got a kidney stone she's in a lot of pain and so i told my wife to stay back but i asked her i said tell me what to preach and she goes i'm not god i said well give me a hand she goes no so i can't get no help from nobody but we try to follow the will of him but this morning if i titled it i would title it the impossible by jesus christ the impossible by jesus christ in philippians 2 we'll read a little bit of scripture try to set a little foundation philippians 2 we find paul speaking to the philippians here and he's beginning to tell them the importance of jesus christ and he says let this mind be in you which also is in christ jesus who being the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant who was made in the likeness of men and i think this morning as i heard the brother do his little uh uh excerpt this morning of a sermon and really deal with the day that we're living in the scriptures and galatians that he was reading we was going through the service and i'm looking at my notes and i'm thinking god you know every situation you know everything that is upon us and lord we could be miles away and you could drive our minds to think the same way and we're living in a day of of such a turmoil of men and women around the land but yet god gave us his word and he placed it in his son and in that we have a bride that believes that and believes that you know what he never made a reputation of himself but you have so many people that wants to make it about i make it about me but yet god wants us to make it about him and this whole book and this whole story and i'm not a writer because if i'd mess it all up but i begin to look from the beginning to the end to the day we live in this is the greatest story that's ever been written and it's the story by jesus christ and jesus was jehovah in the old testament but it was still the same anointing in the same spirit that moved upon men and and i got this uh it's on my facebook page and i've always loved it but it makes a comment it says god has a habit of taking nobodies and making them somebodies and i began to look and i said that's the way god writes his stories he he looks for a servant that is humble whether it's a man a woman a child whatever it may be he looks for someone willing to be humble before his word and he can make somebody out of them he took a david in a day that didn't want nothing to do with the military he didn't want nothing to do with the war but there was something in him that he wanted to be for god and whatever god wanted him to do and i believe that as david would come down from the farms and visit his brothers look david wasn't going to be a member of the military he wasn't going to be a soldier he was bringing food to his brothers to help encourage them but when he got down there david was a humble servant before god and god said i can use this humility i can use this nobody with no training and no warfare no experience and i can make him an overcomer with me inside of him and i believe if we look down and we see that's what makes us overcomers in this day we're overcomers because we are the greatest story that god has ever written he has written the story ye are the impossible written by jesus christ and and paul and paul in philippians here is trying to tell them this is not me that does these things but i have yielded myself to the spirit of god i have yielded my vessel to this god i've heard it my thoughts to the mind of christ and if you want to be like this then let this mind be in you let you become this this is and being found in fashion as men he humbled himself and became obedient even to death even to the death of the cross you know the hardest thing to do is to be obedient to the word of god when the word tells us something you know what we don't want to do it we want to do it our way but a humble servant of god would say god not my will but vine will be done even unto death isn't that what jesus did he stood there in the garden he didn't want to die he didn't want to hang on the cross he didn't want to take the stripes for our healing as much as he loved us he didn't want to go through that but he stood there and he said but god if it be thy will i will do this for my children i will do this because you've asked me to do it god let me be more like christ let me be able to a situation and look around and say god i really don't want to go through this sorrow i don't want to go through this sickness i don't want to go through this faith but if it be thy will lord let me oh be obedient to your word let me be that one that can overcome wherefore god has also have highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that name of all the jihad the name of jesus every knee shall bow and the things of heaven and things of earth these things that are other than he says and every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father what is it it's coming to a place that even when the world is turned against the christians even when the world is turned against god they go totally insane they still have to admit they still have to confess there's something about you there's something about your life why because you're an overcomer in this age the people in david's day they had to look at david and see there was something different about him there was something unique about him when everybody else was scared he wasn't scared when everybody else was falling apart he wasn't falling apart when anybody else was nervous he wasn't nervous why he knew where he stood with the word of god and children of god that's the way we are today that's why it may seem impossible it may seem unlikely but there's a bride today that she knows who she is and she realizes what the word says and she is an overcomer in this day and the world has to admit it's that fulfilling scripture you as every good deed every bad deed every person in this world is fulfilling scripture every every sinner on the street is fulfilling scripture they're fulfilling exactly what god said he said well how will i give you an example you know what when joseph was thrown into the pit joseph was tucked into egypt everywhere joseph went it was a blessing look he was like their golden child that's what brother branham referred to at one time everything that he touched turned to gold he was blessed wife he was a servant of god look i worked at a place and the guy actually used the words not a believer not a christian just an old rough old man that's a boss he looks at me and he says jonathan you're my golden nugget it don't matter where i put you i prosper what he's testifying of the mercies of god he's testifying of the truth of the word of god he's testifying this very scripture every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is the lord of all why because it is his book it is his play it is his example he's using each and every one of us in the way to prepare us and to put a place what is it listen to this once we sing this song with john as he brought me out with that song in the acts of the holy spirit in 1954 said another lady said it's talking to brother brennam said another lady says where do you go to church called her up and i heard this said where do you go to church did i go to the brenham tabernacle and she says you mean you there with that kind of doctrine and getting under such as that see people says well they didn't criticize every devil in hell has criticized the word of god since the beginning of time it hadn't changed today it hasn't it hasn't come to four like today it's always been that way they tried to kill david because they thought david was trying to become king but god said he would become king but yet they was coming against the word for their day they tried to mock noah they didn't try they mocked noah they threw nature was at it they called him every name they was coming against the word for their day and it's the same today says you can you go up there that kind of doctrine be sitting under such a sad and she said what kind of doctrine says well they brag too much on jesus lord i'd like somebody to say i brag too much on jesus come on the world's out to the place they don't want to recognize us he is the master he is the savior he is the all in all he is everything that was everything that will be he is my overcoming power so how do you stay happy by jesus christ how do you be healed by jesus christ how do you be saved by jesus christ how do you live in this state by jesus christ he is everything to me he said oh they brag too much about jesus well maybe we need to brag more about it but let's just be honest sometimes in message churches we brag more about brother branham than we do about jesus come on close to home it don't feel so good but let's think about it let's brag about jesus son let's know the same god that lived in the days before the earth was formed is the same god that lived in the days of our prophet is the same god that is living in you and i today so they brag too much about jesus about baptizing using his name in baptism using his name and everything else that's what i want to do i want to use his name in everything that i do because it isn't my story it's his story i'm just an actor in his book i'm just playing out my part i'm just doing what he's asked me to do why can you do it why can you overcome the impossible by jesus by jesus for the bible said my brethren there is no other way unto heaven given among men no other name above heaven given to men whereby you might be saved certainly he said brother says i tell you brother i'm not a fusser but i'd like to see any man anywhere anytime by the bible prove that isn't right come on that's right no matter what they say you're crazy and everything else it doesn't make a difference all power was given under that name of jesus christ what is it we're living in a day we want to take our eyes off the end look we don't want we don't want to go through trouble we don't want to go through everybody wants the government to pay everything to have do everything they do and they just want to send it home and do nothing nobody wants to work for nothing but god's called a group of people that's willing to fight the fighter that's looking at this day that we're living in this layout of the sea and age all the spirits has come against you there's a bride that's going to create and make the impossible be real what is it we look can we find so many places in the scripture we find david and goliath that we talked about look david couldn't overcome goliath on his own we and you you know become the spirit so but yet god took an impossible situation a situation that there was no way out of and he says but i would perform this in you david and david let me be yours lord look when he went down to the creek and he picked stones up i don't believe he was doing it with an arrogant saying i'm going to throw this and i believe you said god what are you doing god what are you doing in this battle god you know i can't overcome him but there was something inside of him saying but the god of the impossible he's in control of this story he knows how the end's gonna play out and his word will not be turned forward and he told me to enter this fight look children of god the day they were living in he brought us up in this day he didn't make an accident and have you birthed in a different generation i joke about it sometimes myself but there's not no truth in that god chose you and me for this day god shows us he knew the covert outbreak how it would be he knew the sicknesses look the scripture tells us there's coming a day of plagues and famines in the land we're living in that day but yet he didn't say that his bride would be humbled down in defeat walking around with no she said she would be an overcoming bride that she would be the god of the impossible and they say that she would hold her head back she would be without spot or without blemish what is it he knew what you could do i think about the three hebrew children always i always talk about my hebrew children i just love them so much because you know what i think they're so real to us in the fact that you know what that prophet had gone off the scene but yet they remembered what he heard they remembered what he had said and they knew what they were supposed to do children of god were living in a day of impossibilities but yet we already have a word for this day god sent a prophet in our day he sent a prophet to come in this day to preach to us in a way to prepare us for what we have made of to prepare us for the battles that we're going to face to prepare us for the things that we're fighting in 2022 we already have the answer why do we look to the world why don't we look to negativity look this world's become the most negative place in the world this world if it ain't negative it don't make the news come on let's just be honest you don't ever see good stories in the newspaper on tv anymore it's about this guy did this and this crook did this and this guy did this this guy did that but nobody wants to talk about the positive things why is it because it's run by the devil the devil's running politics the devil's running the news media the devil's running the world why our prophet said this is satan's eden satan is on the throne of man's heart satan is on the throne of this country's heart and he knows if he could ever get your attention on the negative that you'll never see the real you you'll never see what god's called you to do think about david if that went down there to battle goliath and all he could think about was how big goliath was come on everybody looks at these stories and i think sometimes we forget that these are real young people this was real people in the bible it isn't just a story written to make us happy he went through trials he went through tribulations he went through those but when he walked out on that battlefield he quit looking at the human side of things and he began to look at the impossible by jesus christ and he says but god you can do this if he would have walked up they're slinging that sling on this ain't going to work what would have happened not a thing as your heart thinketh so is it come on referring to scripture if you go into a battle and you go i'm going to get sick well praise god you're going to get sick you just went ahead and confessed what you're going to do well i'm going to lose this better well i guess i'll see you on the other side as a loser but if we start going into things like these people did in the bible and go you know what i can't do this the other hebrew children they would say we know how god can deliver us but if we don't we ain't going to serve anyone devil what if we've got some members of this proud members of this church that are standing up and say you know what devil i don't care if i lose i don't care if i win but i ain't going to serve you i'm not going to come to your level i'm not going to talk negativity no more i'm going to preach the truth i'm gonna talk to the positive things i'm gonna talk how great my god is i can come out there and tell one person a negative thought two weeks from now everybody in the church knows this i could come out there and tell 50 people a positive thought and nobody'll share it come on let's just be honest let's be honest what does the word say you're an overcomer by the word of your testimony when's the last time a good testament to tell somebody when's the last time we felt comfortable enough to say hey let me tell you what god did because the devil's in the back of your mind going oh you know did he really do no let me tell you what god did for me let me tell you instead of let me tell you what the devil did to me instead of letting me tell you what he tripped me and stumbled into let me tell you god did for me he took me from the pits of hell he took me from the bottom of my sin he split me on a rock and he gave me what i had of amen saying never said you wouldn't go through it i quote in proving his word brother brendan speaking on the three hebrew children i love how he's high love how he words it proving his word now d64 he says now look he took the heat right out of the blaze of the fiery furnace to prove his word was so that he could deliver from the fire he didn't take the fire away the fire killed the other men that was unbelievers but he took the heat out of fire from the children of god look he ain't taking your trolls away he ain't taking your sickness away he ain't making life a comfort of ease for you on a pillow with nothing to go wrong but he's taking the pain of it away he's taking the negativity of it away he's taking all of the pad away and saying but my children are overcomers in this day when they face the impossibility they will overcome they will because he says right amongst those places there was children thrown in there stayed in there a long time and many of the men that throw them in the intense heat of that fiery furnace killed the great soldiers that was leading them up there and god let the fire burn right on but he took the heat out of it he proves if you stand for him he'll stand for you king will take your trial away because then he wouldn't be the god of the impossible you realize everything that he did and as simple as a thought as it may be every example he gave everything that he did everything that he said it has to be it has to come to pass it has to have but his words shall not be turned forward he said that there would be a bride in this day he said that bride would recognize who she was he said that bride would get behind the word of god and would stand on the word of god and she would be an overcomer in this day then you're going to do it it doesn't matter how hard he has to walk you it no matter how hard he's got to pull you it no matter how hard you gotta drag and kick and scratched and fingernails dug into the blood god's gonna get you to an altar god's gonna get you to a place that he can make the impossible when you come to life i'm in control of my life no you're not god's in control of your life you can't happen you can't there's nothing you can control when you leave and hit this road this scene you have no control so i have control of my car no you know where's the steering arm breaks what are you going to do you lost control what if a drunk driver comes across and hits your head on what are you going to do you're here by the mercies and the grace of god god is in control of every situation he knows what you're going to go there look we've heard the story time and time again but the devil couldn't take job to the point of the ash sheep until he got approval from god god knew what job could handle god knows what you can handle and god is making the impossible inside of you this morning every situation you know what most churches just don't even want to have church anymore because they're afraid somebody might be around somebody you know what my god is a healer i believe in being wise i believe in being smart if you're sick and you've got a fever you should stay home but if you ain't to miss walmart you ain't sick enough from this church come on church we're living in a day that the devil's trying to put so many negative ups in you that you can go to walmart you can go to work you can go to the birthday party you can go to the graduation but i'm too sick to go to church that was free he's able to deliver us from the fiery furnace but nevertheless we're not buying to any image because we're standing on the word how does god make the impossible by having someone willing to stand on his word by having someone living in this day to turn around and say god i don't know how it's going gonna happen but i believe your word i believe you sent a prophet in our day i believe you sinned as something what is it jesus you're everything to me jesus you're more to me than my job jesus you're more to me than my family jesus you're more to me than the very heir that i believe jesus you're more to me than all that i have i want you to be number one in my life look everybody's got a number one in their life i just pray that it's him we all got something that will drop forward no matter what and we should we should respect our pastor we should respect our church we should respect our family we all should work and provide for our family but david had a job to do feed his brothers but when he got on the scene everybody else was cowards everybody else was looking at all the negativity and god brought him up and created the impossible in him daniel and the lions then i thought of a thought and i probably read it somewhere it ain't anything i think it's not not not uh original because i've probably read it or seen it but you know what i thought daniel did exactly what god told him to do you know what is coming to a day in our time that they're going to start wanting to close that church door they're going to start wanting to tell you you can't worship in the name of jesus no more they're going to want to tell you that there ain't no other way that you've got to join the mother church and join the church yourself as what but yet daniel was in that same boat and then he says no my god told me to be in face jerusalem and i'm gonna keep doing what god and you know what it cost him what everybody else thought it cost him his life because the punishment was the lines then look at what they throw him in the lines then you know what happened it didn't wasn't the lion's den no more it was daniel's den the lions were just there daniel took control of the situation they throwed him into the deepest pit they throw him into the lion's den they were so hungry they would have naughty within seconds to nothing but yet when daniel a servant of god the god of jesus christ the jesus christ that makes things impossible become possible stepped on the scene now it's daniel's then and now all the lines was there for it was just for company yo daniel would have been lonely if you didn't nobody talked to you all night look he had to have somebody on that hill maybe he petted his mind and said yo boy come on you know what there was no fear in daniel because god that daniel was serving the god of the impossible and there's no fear in the bride of christ today because we're serving that same god the god of the impossible and so when he throws us into a pit we take control of the situation because every demon shall bow at the name of jesus because every spirit shall bow at the name of jesus why he's already conquered death hell in the grave and there's nothing standing before him and if that same god is now living in a bride and she and he is then she has no fear of this world look when you walk into a situation you shouldn't drop your head and shrug and walk off defeated you should stand up and be proud of who you are you stand up you don't want to happen they'll start respecting you like the scripture we read says they'll start confessing their language will start changing you stand for god you act for god you live for god you let your life betray christ and those that are around you will begin to change and to testify that there's something about this name their language starts changing the jokes they tell begin to change what is i'm not saying they've become christians and getting good good to two shoes but you know what there's a change in that atmosphere why because you take control of that situation because you step in and realize the power that you have you still didn't realize the authority that you have as the bride of christ that you take everything on new subjects and you say this is now mighty this is now my city this is now my room this is now my job play now we're going to come to my level what was it the impossible but jesus christ you say oh that's impossible that's why we can't do it but he can do it but he can do it and he uses you to do it so many times we want to humble down and just act like look look we need to understand the real definition of humble humble ain't cowarding down and walking out on the devil humble is realizing i can't do it but greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world and that one by the name of jesus christ he can do it when i don't have words i look at description the scripture says think not of what to say i'll speak for you when i don't know what to do i'll think you know what i don't know what to do but god what do you want me to do do you want me to sing if you do you want me to worship you do you want me just to sit there and bow humbly and pray before you god you lead my life see that's why each and every one of these examples had an overcoming end the three hebrew children wasn't worried about how great they was going to be they was worried about how great their god was going to look david wasn't worried about how great david didn't even want to be king he was anointed king but he didn't want to be king but yet he knew that if he yielded himself god could do something with him church tonight this morning if the bride of christ can never come to full realization that if we yield ourselves look we're full of native thoughts we're humans look you take a hammer and smash your nail you ain't happy about it you're driving down the road and somebody cuts you off and you have slim on your brakes you ain't happy about it we got negative thoughts but yeah there's something inside of us that should rise up and say but all things work together for them that love the lord jesus i'm just here i'm just an example i'm just an example in his story of one that could come joseph in the pit genesis 33 we know the story so well but joseph is thrown into a pit and having it it is nothing of his own doing you know what's wrong with the church today every time we see somebody backslide we think they did something wrong we said somebody's sick we think they did something wrong god's punishing them no god's probably just using them to be the next story in his book the impossible by jesus christ we looked and said oh they must have missed god because you know what they lost their job no ain't got nothing to do with that they may be doing exactly what god called them to do they may be standing on the exact tree and the devil says i can take him and god says you can't touch them and he allows things to happen what was it joseph was chosen of god joseph was blessed of god joseph could interpret dreams joseph could see things and give visions and he was just doing what god taught him to do and it brought by hatred in his brothers come on church look at our own lives how many times has it hatred up in our families just because we do what god tells us to do they said we don't understand why you have to worship like that we don't understand why you have to feel like you've got to go to church no matter what's going on why because there's something inside of me that wants to worship him there's something inside of me that wants to give my life to him it makes those around us angry i laugh sometimes my own family sometimes they know sunday morning i'm going to be in church and they'll schedule something at 11 o'clock on sunday morning well i'm not going to be there i mean it's that simple i'm going to be at church you know i'm going to be church so the way i view it is you must really not want me there come on because that's where my life is my number one is jesus christ my number one is serving him my number one is letting me be humble enough that he can use me as a witness to my family as a witness to the world that there is a living jesus christ in our lives today could you imagine david if his wife were to come to him and says hey instead of going to church tonight we're going to go play hockey come on david would have laughed at her because david had a heart after god and he knew he wanted to be like god knew everything's tried around him but what are some of our excuses come on church come on don't leave me now come on what is someone very well my family's in for the weekend well they come church with me i don't care we got pews extra bring the church with you maybe they're the last one maybe there's somebody there that needs to hear the word of god maybe there's somebody there that needs to feel the spirit move but when we coward down to them we look like the loser and we lose our testimony come up church we're living in a day god needs real men and daughters son and daughters of god to stand up and stand on his word to say you know what there's nothing more important to me than hearing from my king there's nothing of greater importance than hearing look look we got all week to do everything we want to do i don't know why we got on that maybe somebody's struggling with it we got all week to do what we need to do we got church which means we don't say anymore if we can't give that to him we need help look back when i was a kid we used to have week-long meetings and you know what people took off of work all week so that they could make sure the grass was cut they could make sure the tent pose was tight they could make sure that the platform was clean they could make sure the trash was took out they could make sure that they could come before two hours early and pray and get the spirit right for service that night i do not see revivals no more because we don't have time for revivals but god is the elect he is the god of the impossible in this day when the day when the world don't want nothing new with it there's still a bride that wants more of him there's still a bride that wants to hear more important than anything but see joseph found himself in that pit of nothing of his own doing his brothers got mad and threw him in a pit look a lot of times our families get mad and throw us in a pit it may not be a pit of a whale or a pit of a stone but they push us outside and we're the black sheep of the family because we won't do this and we won't partake in this and we're becoming a pit in our lives and the devil attacks our minds and he attacks our spirits he says see if you would just give in a little bit you could be more loved i don't want to be loved to this world i want to be loved of jesus christ when he rounded himself in that pit he didn't start thinking what could i have done different he began to think oh god here i am lord what do you want me to do here come on children of god it was the act of the impossible becoming impossible by our lord jesus christ and he's the same one today as he was in that day when you get in your pit he's looking to make that pit his platform so the world can see there is a living god today took him out of that pit taking egypt and he wound up in a jail cell not of his own doing again come on children of god we end up in a lot of places not of our own doings we wind up in a lot of places not because we did something wrong not because we're a failure in god's side but because the world hates us look joseph was important for us how joseph was there and he was making everything perfect and they was jealous as follows his wife says i'm going to take him down she tried to take him down and all she did was make him greater come on that's what happens to us every time the devil tries to take you down all he does is make your testimony greater every time he tries to put you in a jail put you in a pit put you in a backsliding condition all he's doing is making your testimony greater because there's an exit to that jail cell because god had already ordained american to have a dream and need a dream interpreter and he had daniel sitting in that jail still waiting to interpret that dream but what kind of influence was he in that jail look we know the scripture right it was a man that was in jail with him that topham hall i know a man how did he know him because he watched his life he saw him in the jail cell every day bound with chains and he didn't drop his head in the fence he got up every morning and he prayed to his god he got up on his seat and he throwed his hands up as high as he could and began to worship god and that man seemed for something different than joseph than all the other males they began to see there's something in him why because the god of the impossible was in life and he took him out and put him on a high place and you know the story what was it every pit that he went in became a platform for him to stand now it became a witness and an evidence it became something to the world to see the god of elijah the god of jesus jesus himself is living in a vessel now and it's the same for you and i everything that we go through every fight that we go through every trial that we go through is nothing more than us climbing the ladder getting closer to his likeness come on what is it even as they set him off and they sold him he began to boss for his life again you ever noticed every time the world kicks you down god gives you something a little extra you know why because it's in his word he says when the enemy comes in like a high tide he'll raise a standard against that every time you don't think you can go home and situation looks impossible he brings a standard a little higher he runs away me and it just picks you right on up is she a little closer to him what he's looking what is he to you this morning you know i jotted down several things here what is it to you brother brown hit several of these and and i just took them and added to them he says he is the rock of my salvation acts 4 and 12 is that he's the rock of my salvation look jesus is the rock of my salvation not the cloud not the bridge you know why so many people fall away from the messages just they've never been the rock their rock was the cloud and when people come against the cloud they didn't have nothing to fall back on their rock was the bridge and when they started coming against the bridge they didn't have nothing to fall back on but there's the bride of christ that the rock of her salvation is jesus christ they can't do nothing with him they've tried for two thousand plus years and they can't no fault in him he was the perfect one he didn't have no misjudgments he didn't have no wrongdoing and if your rock is in him then you cannot fail what is it he's my healer you're sick this morning he's your healer he took your strides for your healing he's going to give it to you if you're accepted this morning he's my burden i mean he's had burdens before i've got burdens now there's things in this life that weighs us down but he's my burden bearer the god of the impossible is here amongst us today what is it he is my freedom do you hear the sister sing this song i know what freedom is now you know what i never really knew about freedom i thought freedom was serving the devil i thought freedom was drink it all i wanted to drink smoking all the dope that i wanted to smoke i thought freedom's doing what i wanted to do but i was nothing but a chain addict to the devil but i know what freedom is now why because jesus christ gave me freedom he is my freedom and whom believeth on him he shall set free he is my god he come to me in psalms 48 he says david speaking he says for this god is our god forever and ever and he will be our god even unto death even unto death you know what if the doctor say covet takes you god will steal your god even unto death if god's again the doctor said cancer takes you cancer didn't take it over didn't take it god took you because god is in control of your life god knows when it's your time and you cannot go until it's your time god is in control under my death god is still my god he is my life john 14 19 says yet in a little while the world sees me no more but ye see me because i live you also shall live and what jesus seen this day approaching he seen a day approaching that they would look away from jesus christ they would look away from the word of god that they would look to their traditions they would look to their creeps they would even talk about look there's more christians professed in the world today than there's ever been but there's less church members than there's ever been how does that work out i had a brother tell me here the other day that was raised in this message same as me went to the same church believe the way i believe and he says i am the church i don't have to go to church no more where does that nonsense come from i told one sister she told me she said she said just because you go to church don't make me a christian because that's true i said i'm a mechanic by trade just because you have a mechanics toolbox don't make you a mechanic she goes yeah that's my point and i go well let me tell you something every good mechanic's got a mechanics toolbox and every good church goes to church come on if you're a good christian you're going to go to church why because brother brenda said it's according to david he comes he says let us rejoice to know that we've been in the presence of the lord how do you come to the prison you can't wait to come to church when the church door is open there comes something inside of you you don't care how many non-believers are there you don't care how many make believers there but you know you're a real believer and you're going to be in the house of god to worship this morning what is it he's my savior for whosoever my name shall be saved what he should be all in all he should be everything us god uses every example we got so many examples we can use but he got so many examples of the impossible situation and he takes control he moves in their life what is our commission mark 16 we know the scripture and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be downed and these shine shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up servants serpents shall drink any anything it shall not hurt them they shall lay the hands on the sick and they shall recall in 2022 he's still the same god of the impossible look i don't care what you're going through this morning i don't care what sickness you may have i don't care what situation you may be in i don't care what fights you may be in with the devil with your family with whoever god is in control of every situation god's seen what tomorrow holds before you ever wake up in the morning he knows what you're going through and he cares about you but do we care about him god scripture signs at the time 1964 brother brennan says say for instance there's a policeman you've heard this story there's a policeman standing out there in the street and he weighs 110 pounds and he comes in a whole row of traffic 80 miles an hour 300 horsepower engines in them and there was buzzing down that street 300 horsepower engines why that little fella doesn't stand a chance he doesn't have the power to stop one of them but just let that bad shine and he raised his hand and listened to all the brake squeal and watched him slide sideways it isn't the power that stops him it's the authority in that batch come on children of god you can't do it on your own but when you step into it again when daniel stepped into that dean of lions that authority that he had took control of the situation when you step into that situation you take control because of what is inside of you not because of your frail body not because of your mistakes not because of all your misdoing but because that bad honor that badge of the holy spirit that you have living in your life it takes control of every situation he said and the church has an authority from jesus christ in my name they should cast out devils they just speak with tongues they shall take up serpents they should drink of any deadly things it is not harming them he said if they lay their hands on the sick they will recover you believe that this morning then you know what why do we stop doing it if you're sick they that lay hands upon them they shall recover why because we lose confidence in him we look at ourselves we look at the negativity we look at our friends what if david would have looked at all of his mistakes and not looked at the promise come on david a man after god's own heart but yet he made a mistake after saying kept a mistake after mistake come on what about samsung i've been using simpson a lot here lately because you know what i see simpson in the day look i'm not going to throw off on youth meetings i'm a believer in youth meetings but i'll see sent some parallery to the day that we're living in they get to a good emotion they get to a good feeling but then they go right back home and go right back to the thing that the devil's dragging them away from we need a true salvation in a young person's heart not any emotional feeling but we need something to root in and take that old man out and let a new man be born in them samson's problem was simpson kept going back to the lie why because his flesh kept lusting after delilah and he would get an experience what do you mean he would get up and he would break up the pillars and the gates and he'd walk him up on the hill with the power of god all over him but then he would turn and go right back to that sin come on if we're not careful we do the same thing today we get to a good church service we get to a good youth meeting we get to a good revival we get an emotional breakthrough but then we turn and we go right back to that sin come on we don't need that repetition in the love today we need soul saving power from the name of jesus christ we need the old man to die the god of the impossible he said he can't do it in young people today that's a lie because i've got a i've got more young people than i can name that's got a true feeling of the holy spirit you know are they perfect no but i'm not perfect so who am i to judge come on come on i know that's hard i know it's hard and it gets on our toes whenever because you know what we want to sit back and go i've been in the message 30 years i could tell you if you got the holy ghost no you can't the only person knows if they got the holy ghost is you is you you knowing yourself whether you got it or not there are no other man alive can tell you you haven't already got it if they try to they're speaking like the devil get away from them come on because we're living in a day of such deception we're living in a day where men's trying to make themselves god but it isn't men it's jesus christ he is the one i worship he is the one i see he said oh now the church has that authority he said what is it he said now he said it's the same little polishman if he's afraid to raise his hand and step out in traffic come on he knows what that badge represents but what if he's afraid to step out and go stop they ain't worth wearing the badge they're not going to keep him on four slots probably gonna put him in dispatch because when the heat gets good he can take it what's his brother say he goes and he says now look he says he says the same little opponent is afraid to raise his hand and step out in traffic he'd better take off the uniform present the badge back because he'll never make a polishman he says neither will we ever make a believer as long as we're afraid to exercise that authority he said that's been given to us by jesus christ we have the victory we don't have any other we don't have any fight for the victory we already have the victory he conquered it for us not us but he conquered it first we're not the mighty conqueror he's a mighty conqueror when i step into a situation if i don't have the gumption if i don't have the faith to step out and say he that is within me is greater than your devil makes me a pretty weak believer but god's looking for stern soldiers he's looking for those that we read of in the bible that we look in the example he looking for him in 2022 for young people for old people for middle-aged people he's looking for saints daughters sons of god to step out and say devil you're not coming this way devil this is my family i'm putting the token on my house i'm putting the token over my kids i'm putting the token over my loved ones i'm believing in the name of jesus christ the god of the impossible that all things but you don't know how far my kids this way i don't care how far they sway you put them under the blood of jesus christ and he can make the impossible seem real he can make the impossible will joshua 10. look moses done gone off the scene i bet you joshua was a man just like many of us are he had thoughts prophet's gone come on children of god we gotta i mean look years ago we had to dig for a book but now we got every book in this church of every message every preached most of us has got it on our phones and ipads of every word that the prophet said at our fingertips right we what he said we have access to every bit of it but yet he's not on the scene and so it's easy to wonder what's he going to do verse 8 he says and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i have delivered them into thy hand children of god this morning don't feel the enemy this morning the god of the impossible is with you the god of impossible is with you this morning he's standing there by your side waiting for you to realize you can't do it he's waiting for you to say god i can't do this moving my life god i can't handle this stress anymore moving my life i can't handle this sickness anymore in my life but as long as we try to be our own gods he's just sitting there waiting on you and i just say god was brother stephen sister gayle carroll sung this song for years and years little david said lord this battle is not mine i give it to them for it's yours lord because you are the god of the impossible i'm not look i can go through my life and i failed miserably but one day i realized god this ain't my fight this is your fight i've delivered them into my hand there are not a man of them stand before thee then joshua's faith then just speak joshua to the lord in that day in the lord delivered up the immorats before the children of israel and he said unto the side of israel's son stand still what happened joshua wasn't powerful enough to make that son stand still but the one in him the same jesus christ had power over everything look i'm coming to a close what is it today god fights our battles it's his book it's his story we are the actors playing the part the impossible by jesus christ what is it 1950 who is god brother said joshua stop the son is that true somebody said all things are possible with god nothing impossible he said but all things are possible to you also nothing impossible to them that believe all things are possible brought right down and made you if you just know who god is he said well i'm afraid that the church doesn't know the authority i'm afraid that the holy ghost when men doesn't realize their authority here or the authority that god has permitted to his church he says i give thee the kings of the kingdom whether you bind or whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed i give you the power of servants over all kinds of ages over everything nothing shall harm you exercise your faith this morning let loose god have his wife he'll grant you that victory we sing victory is mine victory is mine you can't have a victory without a fight and the only way you're going to get that victory is exercise your faith look i preached a message he'll walk back at home and i titled it activate your faith you know how i got it is because it's simple things that create thoughts you know brother brennan preached thank you man's field for out of a pack of cigarettes okay so so don't criticize me because i think that's pretty good you know but uh we work on cummins engines and and then to to diag a cummins engine you need the proper software but once you have the proper software you have to have an activation code to activate it you can have all the software laptop but if you don't activate it it won't do you no good if you don't pay for that activation code and put that activation code it looks pretty it's got the pretty little c with comments written through it don't do you no good until you activate it we have the power of jesus christ inside of every one of us but if you don't activate it it does no good if you try to fight your own battles it does you no good you're going to fail you're going to get beaten you're going to get drugged through the muck through the mire of this day but if you're activated if you're exercising and just step out look that policeman that brother but i'm talking about when he steps out there he knows that he can't stop that drug but he knows that authority that's behind him too look when the devil takes you up against a wall you know you can't do nothing with him but you know who the real you is too come on john 14 says believe us there now that i am the father and the father in me and the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he does the works he does the works believe me that i am the father and the father in me or else believe me for the work's sake verily verily i say unto thee he that believeth on me the work shall i do he shall also in greater work than these that he should do because i go into my father and whosoever you shall whatever you shall ask in my name that will i do in the fight and if you sure asked of anything in my name i would do it so that's so i've heard it a million times where are we going to start doing it let's build our faith morning let's encourage ourselves this morning to know the god of the impossible is still living in our midst today 61 paradox but brother says jesus did the works of his father because the father was in him that is why the works was done is because the father was in the sun do you believe that that in him he was he was the incarnated god do you believe that that the god of the father that which is the father of jesus christ the great spirit dwelleth in the fullness of his power in jesus christ which was the tabernacle of god made flesh dwelt on the earth presenting the word jesus was the word amen and the bible said in saint john chapter one first chapter he says in the in it was invisible now the word invisible until it became flesh and then the word become visible and through his sanctified death at calvary his resurrection possibly placed his church in that realm that same invisible god because come into the individual and make the word visible what is it we're getting to a higher level it's more than just coming to church it's more than just exercising our faith it's coming to the realization the same god that walked with christ on the sea of galilee the same god that walked with him when he healed the sick and he rose the dead is the same god that is now visible in a bride in her words not because she's doing it because he's doing it in her it's visible to the world and they shall confess every knee shall vow every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord white because of what you're doing because of what we're doing as the bride not because we're sitting there doing nothing not because we just jumped down because we got our heads held high we throw our hands up and we should go we always go to church we always praise the name we always got a good word to say somebody we always are willing to testify of the greatness and the goodness of god because he's become visible and you and i we've become one with him living in a day now that it's more than just saying you believe the bible it's more than just saying you believe there was a prophet sitting this day and i believe that's the prophet they were sent to us but it's now manifesting what that prophet said you can quote it all day long but if you can't live it something's not right you could say well brendon said this amen can you manifest it well i'm still struggling well praise god you're still struggling because that means you're trying but we're coming today to the fullness of him that we are the living image of god to the world more than just a story more than just some book written with fancy handwriting but we are that story amen musicians want to come i'll find a place to close 1960 the ever-present water from the rock he says that when you are saved god gives you faith to rise from the mark of the earth your faith overcomes the things of the world what is your faith your faith in the act that god has did in you to make you a son of god you quit your lying you quit your stealing you quit your drinking because your faith rises you above it amen he says and if you don't do it you don't have any faith and by the faith you are saved and through grace brother says as much as your faith will be relieved as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you have that's the level you're living on if you're comfortable just not drinking anymore then there's nothing else in there to take you higher but there's something in the bride that wants to be like him he said because you have in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth god dwells in you and you are sons and daughters god amen he said there you are but it's your faith jesus said according to your faith being unto you that kenneth believe all things are possible verily i say unto you if you say unto this mountain be moved and don't doubt it but believe it then no you should have what you said then what kind of people are we be having the faith this great redeeming christ that lives in us the spitting rock never leaves the church i am with you always and to the ends of the world the ever presence of the great guts or salvation power that poured forth from calvary and the earth in every presence of the living thing the great flowing spitting rock that goes in their journey israel lost her faith and they got the path they began to lust for the fleshpots if they had stayed with the faith and believing god was pouring them taking them to land they would have never would have been nothing to hinder them amen joshua caliph had the faith they said we are more able to oblige conquer anything that would come before us that's the trouble with the church we can conquer every disease we got the power in us we're sons and daughters of god nothing can stand before us the only thing he wants to find somebody who will believe it the god of the impossible is still writing his story today stand with me this morning he's just looking for someone to believe it this morning amen you believe it this morning you have a need this morning [Music] amen we're going to pray sing a song or two worship him but you know there's nothing can come before god look i wanted to go another route this morning but god just really wanted me to build your faith this morning i hope you listen i hope you heard i open encourage you this morning because there's nothing that can stand before the bride of christ you are the living image of god in this day when it says that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess what are they confessing the confessing that you are the living image of god god is never without a witness he's never without a testimony amen raise your hands just to say what a prayer heavenly father lord lord you know each and every individual our lord but you know everything that has bound us that is binding us or that's trying to trick us lord trying to stumble us lord i don't know nothing but god you know it all lord if i said anything that you wouldn't approve of let our minds forget it lord lord let something be said that rooted down in our hearts to cause us to activate our faith to step out on faith and rise a little higher but we're living in a day that it's not good enough to say well message believers it's not good enough to come to church and hold a bible and hold a church age book there's got to be a life to identify lord lord you see everything sickness lord you see every need lord would you minister to this body lord would you minister to their pastor and their pastor's wife and those so many
