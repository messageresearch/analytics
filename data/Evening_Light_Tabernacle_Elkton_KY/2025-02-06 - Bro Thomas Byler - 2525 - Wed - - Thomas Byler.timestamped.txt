[33:53] amen a couple month ago we got him
[33:55] scheduled in for coming next weekend
[33:56] amen amen the following weekend so
[34:00] praise the Lord God is good isn't he
[34:03] amen let's just bow our heads and talk
[34:04] to the author of the book lord Jesus
[34:07] before we open this Bible we want to
[34:08] just talk to you for a minute Lord Jesus
[34:11] we want to first of all thank you for
[34:12] who you are and what you mean to us Lord
[34:15] Jesus and how grateful we are that we
[34:17] don't have to live life that we don't
[34:19] have to go through life Lord Jesus
[34:21] without you without the comfort of your
[34:23] spirit father Lord we're so grateful God
[34:26] when you told your disciples IES said
[34:28] you would send them the comforter and
[34:30] God that that comforter would lead us
[34:32] into all truth and that we would not be
[34:35] comfortless I will not leave you
[34:36] comfortless father we're so grateful
[34:38] that that applies to us today Lord we
[34:41] know that until the bride leaves the
[34:43] world and you lift your spirit up from
[34:46] the Gentiles Lord we know that your
[34:48] people will always be occupied Lord
[34:51] Jesus by your with your spirit in their
[34:53] hearts we thank you for that tonight
[34:55] Lord and we ask God Lord that you just
[34:57] take the meditation of a heart that
[34:59] which we feel that you've been pressed
[35:01] upon our heart to speak tonight Lord
[35:03] that you'll just he take it and speak
[35:05] what you want to say and help me to
[35:07] completely stay out of it father so that
[35:09] Lord everything would be pleasing to you
[35:11] and it would be all according to your
[35:12] will father we do all already and that
[35:16] once again believe Lord Jesus that those
[35:18] that are not feeling well will raise up
[35:20] again and be just fine because Lord we
[35:22] know that by your stripes they were
[35:24] healed 2,000 years ago and we've already
[35:27] claimed it we believe it with all of our
[35:28] heart so father there's only one thing
[35:31] to do and that's for to watch it happen
[35:33] and we just ask Lord now that you'll
[35:34] take the reading of the word meditation
[35:36] of a heart Bless the people that have
[35:38] come Lord far and wide and those who
[35:41] couldn't make it Lord we ask Lord you'd
[35:42] bless them streaming tonight heal them
[35:45] Lord and raise them up in Jesus name
[35:47] amen and amen I just didn't feel like I
[35:50] was quite done with my sermon last time
[35:53] amen so we're going to kind kind of keep
[35:55] going off of that and it'll certainly be
[35:58] uh it a little tap into that little
[36:01] series of the Gospel in a nutshell amen
[36:03] we're going to go back into that for
[36:05] just a little bit if that's okay with
[36:06] you amen amen so let's just read a
[36:10] couple scriptures and we'll get started
[36:12] here amen and see what the Lord will
[36:16] have I think if we want to go to Hebrews
[36:20] if you will turn your Bibles to the book
[36:22] of
[36:24] Hebrews amen
[36:31] there was a quote that I kind of come
[36:33] off come off of that I really liked and
[36:36] I just thought that uh it's so much
[36:39] deeper perhaps than what we realize and
[36:42] so I want to try to take it as take it
[36:44] to a new depth basically amen and we
[36:47] spoke on it a little bit Amen on our
[36:49] last sermon amen but we want to speak a
[36:51] little bit more Amen on that
[36:55] amen Hebrews 12 and verse one wherefore
[36:58] seeing we also are compassed about with
[37:01] so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[37:03] aside every weight and the sin which
[37:06] does so easily beset us and let us run
[37:09] with patience the race that is set
[37:11] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[37:14] and finisher of our faith who for the
[37:16] joy that was set down before him endured
[37:18] the cross despising the shame and is sit
[37:21] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[37:24] God in Revelations 3
[37:28] Revelations
[37:36] 3 and verse
[37:40] 20
[37:42] one Revelations 3 and 21 to him that
[37:45] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[37:47] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[37:51] am sit down with my father in his throne
[37:55] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[37:57] the spirit saith unto the churches may
[38:00] God add His blessings to the reading of
[38:01] the word amen you can be comfortable at
[38:04] this time and have your seats while I
[38:06] preach for about a half hour or so amen
[38:10] amen it's putting it just a little bit
[38:11] different
[38:12] right amen we hear the same thing all
[38:15] the time amen is it nice to have
[38:18] comfortable
[38:19] seats praise the Lord I've heard of a
[38:21] Preacher way back in the stone ages amen
[38:24] making all of his congregation sit on
[38:26] rocks and stuff they didn't want them
[38:28] too much comfortable it would wouldn't
[38:29] be hard to get up and praise the Lord
[38:31] under those
[38:33] conditions amen amen but we thank God
[38:37] Amen for what he does for us amen and so
[38:40] forth amen so amen now praise the Lord I
[38:44] I I thought I would tell you well you
[38:46] know when you Don't Preach for a week or
[38:48] two you get a little rusty so y'all pray
[38:51] for me amen we wear this rust right off
[38:53] and amen have it have the metal shining
[38:56] again amen praise the Lord God bless you
[38:59] this evening amen so I'm going to take
[39:01] my cat off amen now let's just uh let's
[39:04] just take a thought here and I want to
[39:07] title this I want to title this very
[39:10] different but I want to talk amen um
[39:14] Amen Let me see what I've got to wrote
[39:16] down here God's
[39:18] motive and objective God's motive and
[39:22] objective amen now how many knows that
[39:25] brother bandam he taught a lot about
[39:27] motive and
[39:29] objective amen and now of course a
[39:34] motive is your purpose right it's your
[39:40] intent amen motive is God's intent what
[39:44] he had intended in the way that God what
[39:47] his motive was in doing things and and
[39:49] brother Brenham applied it to us and
[39:51] when I looked at this amen I looked at
[39:53] so many times where uh the prophet of
[39:56] God how he would he would talk about
[39:59] when he would talk about this he would
[40:01] say how that when you want to well let
[40:04] me just let me just uh let me just read
[40:07] it to you would that be
[40:09] okay he says now if the Bible says that
[40:11] he is the same yesterday today and
[40:13] forever then he's got to be the same in
[40:15] principle the same in power the same in
[40:18] action the same in motive and objective
[40:21] amen he's got to be the same in every
[40:24] way only in the Corporal body and when
[40:26] you plead anything to God he says you've
[40:29] got to there's got to be a reason for it
[40:32] it's just like the scripture as I've
[40:34] often said if you say to this mountain
[40:36] be moved and don't doubt it but if you
[40:39] believe that what you have said it'll
[40:40] come to pass you'll have what you said
[40:42] he says now that's all together
[40:45] controlled on motive and
[40:48] objective now before we get into our
[40:51] real thought I want to just kind of
[40:52] bring this in for a little bit if I
[40:54] could because we know that uh you got
[40:56] everything especially when you ask God
[40:59] something you've got to have the right
[41:00] motive for it the right objective for it
[41:03] so I wrote down here no matter what you
[41:05] do it has to have the right motive
[41:09] behind
[41:13] it now as human beings we can be
[41:16] connivers I say that because uh I've
[41:19] listened to it and I've I I've heard
[41:21] people conniving with
[41:23] me all right people have connived with
[41:26] me because they would ask me a certain
[41:28] question and I would answer a certain
[41:31] way but I know that them folks got
[41:33] another reason for asking
[41:35] it hello and sure enough it was you know
[41:40] so you got to you know it's hard to
[41:41] judge people's motive and objective but
[41:44] you got to have your motive right your
[41:46] objective right and I heard many brother
[41:48] B said many times that in order the only
[41:51] way that you'll have the right motive
[41:52] and objective is in other words you got
[41:54] to have the right reason for asking it
[41:57] God for
[42:00] anything why you know you know even your
[42:04] healing brother BR talked about why do
[42:05] you want to be healed why if you want to
[42:08] be healed so that you can go out there
[42:10] and live nasty again you probably won't
[42:12] receive your healing you got to have the
[42:14] right reason for
[42:16] it the motive and objective that you
[42:19] have another place he talked about he
[42:21] says and no selfish motive will
[42:25] worken brother as a preacher you know
[42:28] you might want to become a preacher
[42:30] because oh my you you listen to Brother
[42:32] Don and you hear people that have become
[42:34] popular boy they're you know they're a
[42:36] machine gun preacher well I that's what
[42:38] I'd like to be like you know I'd like to
[42:39] be popular well guess what you're going
[42:41] to fail sure as the world if your motive
[42:44] isn't
[42:45] right amen but I'm talking about taking
[42:48] a church maybe a preacher wants to take
[42:50] a bigger church it's a bigger church
[42:51] it's a bigger group there maybe be more
[42:54] money in it in the back of his mind
[42:56] hello I'll be more pop if you've got the
[42:59] wrong motive it'll never work no selfish
[43:03] motive will ever
[43:06] work amen so how many believes we got to
[43:09] watch our motives and our objectives but
[43:11] now God now let's take a turn here amen
[43:14] God had a motive how many believe you
[43:16] God had a motive in it all we already
[43:18] covered am me how that he was way before
[43:20] time and so forth and he had an
[43:22] objective something that he wanted to
[43:24] get done
[43:29] amen once again we're going to look at
[43:31] this if that's okay with you where's my
[43:33] book here it is so we're going to read a
[43:36] very familiar quote if that's okay
[43:39] herein brother bam says is set forth the
[43:41] love of God God desired in love a family
[43:45] of his
[43:46] own now how many knows because of the
[43:49] family that God has created amen amen a
[43:52] a boy and a girl meeting and getting
[43:54] married having children raising a family
[43:57] that's what was in the back of God's
[44:00] mind his motive was that he didn't want
[44:04] to be alone he wanted
[44:10] companionship let that sink a little bit
[44:13] I me know that's what God
[44:16] wants he loves your fellowship he loves
[44:19] when you're driving down the road and
[44:20] you talk to
[44:23] him I don't care if you think he don't
[44:26] hear you or don't know sure if he hears
[44:27] or not talk to
[44:33] him
[44:34] [Applause]
[44:36] amen maybe we ought to talk to him as
[44:38] much as we talk to ourselves sometimes
[44:40] because I have a bad habit of
[44:43] that wife who you talking to I'm talking
[44:45] to myself let me alone I'm having a good
[44:47] time

[45:49] was thinking about you know I said you
[45:51] know the Lord was just kind of
[45:53] quickening things to me and you know and
[45:56] and I was thinking how that he was
[45:57] opening the valve and and and and and
[46:00] fellowshipping with me and talking to me
[46:02] and and you know and I I got to thinking
[46:05] about God and and and how much that God
[46:07] loves
[46:08] us and how did how did he in his mind he
[46:11] had one of the family of his own and how
[46:13] much he loves you and I thought you know
[46:16] I want to ask a church well let me let
[46:19] me say this before I forget it but I got
[46:21] to thinking about being up here
[46:22] preaching you know and how that when I
[46:25] was there God was just kind kind of open
[46:27] the valve so to speak and I thought you
[46:30] know that's what we ought to do don't
[46:32] you like it when the preacher actually
[46:34] amen gets out of himself and gets away
[46:37] and and and begins to preach yeah come
[46:40] on turn the valve open come on brother
[46:42] that's why we say come on brother preach
[46:44] it brother in other words turn the valve
[46:46] on don't don't turn that water speak on
[46:50] I want a big
[46:52] valve how many wants God to come and
[46:54] open the valve for us amen the flood
[46:57] come
[47:00] in that's right how do you do it Amen
[47:03] brother preach it brother open the
[47:06] mou I don't care if it's dark I don't

[47:11] night amen you can let God comeing in
[47:14] and have his way let the Holy Spirit
[47:17] come down right now amen and saturate
[47:21] your brains a little bit amen and then
[47:23] come down into your soul a little bit
[47:28] anyway I got to think of how much does
[47:31] God love us can somebody tell me how
[47:34] much God loved us how much God loves
[47:37] us do that again keep it out there look
[47:40] at brother John turn around look at
[47:42] brother John y'all see that that's the
[47:46] correct answer or that's the answer I
[47:48] was looking
[47:49] for that's right that's how much he
[47:52] loved us when he gave us on Calvary why
[47:56] when he was on the cross I was on his
[48:01] mind cuz I was thinking of preaching how
[48:04] that you know God said I know the
[48:06] thoughts that I have for you amen that
[48:08] they're good thoughts how many believes
[48:10] when God thought of you amen he had good
[48:12] thoughts when he was by himself and he
[48:14] was thinking he was thinking of you and
[48:17] he had good
[48:19] thoughts where was you job when was you
[48:23] when the sons of God shouted for joy and
[48:26] where was that at all back in God's mind
[48:29] God saw
[48:31] it that was God's
[48:34] intent God's
[48:36] intent God's
[48:38] motive was to have
[48:42] children not just
[48:44] children but sons and daughters like I
[48:48] said in the last message that are in the
[48:51] image of him how many believ we were
[48:54] predestinated to be conformed to the
[48:56] image image of his son if you're a Son
[48:59] of
[49:00] God it was his intent for you to be like
[49:05] him to be like
[49:14] Jesus amen then as I was scooping stuff
[49:20] up brother B you ain't got sent that
[49:23] well that's what I was doing I'm I was
[49:24] going to let you
[49:25] know amen
[49:29] that I
[49:31] thought you
[49:36] know why does
[49:39] God allow us to go through the things
[49:41] that we go
[49:43] through he wants Sons and Daughters of
[49:47] God his
[49:49] intent I hope I can pick this back
[49:53] up but his intent
[49:57] is that
[49:59] he what did he
[50:06] do it says that looking unto Jesus the
[50:10] author and the finisher of our faith who
[50:13] for the joy that was set down before him
[50:15] endured the cross despising the same and
[50:18] is sat down at the hand of the the right
[50:21] hand of the Throne of God how many
[50:24] believe that's where Christ is he's the
[50:26] right hand of the Throne of God then we
[50:29] read Revelations where it says that him
[50:31] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[50:35] me in my throne even as I
[50:40] overcame now pull that into where
[50:42] brother B says you know amen he says God
[50:45] will do nothing for you until you first
[50:48] confess that he's already done it every
[50:51] chapter every verse how many believes
[50:53] that amen when when brother Brandon
[50:54] preached on adoption
[50:57] he talked about that Moses was amen he
[50:59] only loved the children so far but it
[51:02] was Joshua a type of the Holy Ghost that
[51:04] took him into the promised land and
[51:06] divided the inheritance and when he went
[51:09] into the promised land every place that
[51:11] the soul of their foot tread was
[51:14] theirs I was listening to brother B I
[51:16] won't bother go into my take my my my my
[51:18] phone and pull it up but he says you
[51:20] know the one thing he said that in that
[51:21] Promised Land it isn't that they were
[51:23] promised any kind of far bed of East and
[51:26] mean didn't mean they we're not going to
[51:27] have trouble but he said there's one
[51:29] thing it meant and that is that it meant
[51:31] that it was theirs so get up and take it
[51:34] how many believe that the land is ours
[51:37] this whole book Is Ours but you got to
[51:40] go and take it I believe that if you
[51:42] ever sit on the throne you've got to sit
[51:44] on the throne first in your
[51:50] mind amen that's why we're going to go
[51:54] there tonight we're going to go over to
[51:55] the Book of Revelation we want to look
[51:56] at
[51:57] that but we want to cover the process
[52:01] that God takes us through to sit with
[52:04] him in the throne is that okay give you
[52:07] a little line of my line of
[52:10] thought amen now back to my thought that
[52:13] I remembered to think I better say it
[52:15] quick or I'll forget it but the devil
[52:19] think about
[52:22] this why God went about it the way that
[52:24] he did why allowed us to fall be born in
[52:28] a sinful
[52:30] condition hello a fallen
[52:33] condition we were born in a fallen
[52:36] condition is't that
[52:37] right I thought you know wouldn't it be
[52:40] nice brother Danny if we all were just
[52:43] perfect you
[52:44] know we never said anything to offend
[52:47] each other never did anything to offend
[52:50] each
[52:53] other and we offend each other because
[52:55] we don't do anything
[52:56] and we offend each other because we do
[52:58] something you know you can't you know
[53:00] you're going to offend
[53:03] somebody but anyway if we had just been
[53:08] perfect well how many knows the devil
[53:11] was
[53:12] perfect the devil was at the right hand
[53:14] of God he was perfect he was the right
[53:17] hand man of God so to speak God's
[53:19] rightand man he was there in Perfection
[53:22] and what happened to him he
[53:25] fell he became
[53:27] dirty he become
[53:30] Fallen
[53:33] sinful
[53:34] huh we would say what in the world now
[53:38] God turns
[53:39] around what does he do with you and I we
[53:43] were born lost we were born Fallen we
[53:46] were sinful God takes that amen and he's
[53:50] taking us to perfection
[53:57] that's
[53:58] right he's taking us to
[54:03] Perfection amen now our goal how many
[54:07] would say our goal is to sit with him in
[54:10] his
[54:11] throne sure it is but in order for us to
[54:15] sit in his throne you won't sit in his
[54:18] throne but B makes it clear the Bible
[54:20] makes it clear that if you don't
[54:22] overcome only the Overcomers
[54:28] not those that almost
[54:30] overcome just about
[54:32] overcome no but the Overcomers are going
[54:35] to sit with
[54:36] him and what rule with
[54:41] him all right here we're going to stop
[54:43] go down another little
[54:50] Trail God's
[54:52] intent God's intent
[54:58] is for us to what rule with him how many
[55:03] beli we're going to rule with him we're
[55:05] going to reign with
[55:09] him and he uses the talents that he gave
[55:13] five
[55:13] talents two talents and one five two and
[55:18] one see and he gave him talents
[55:22] and one the one with five got five more
[55:25] and his the Lord said unto him Well done
[55:27] thy good and faithful servant thou has
[55:30] been Faithful over few
[55:34] things so you ain't got to do a whole
[55:36] lot you don't have to be faithful over a
[55:39] whole lot just be faithful over the
[55:41] little things that God has given
[55:47] you
[55:49] amen but if you're not faithful in the
[55:52] little things you won't be faithful in
[55:53] the big things
[55:58] notice Faithful over guys been Faithful
[56:01] over few things I will make the
[56:04] [Music]
[56:06] ruler over many things enter thou into
[56:10] the joy of the Lord and he says that
[56:12] same thing about that had one that had
[56:13] gotten to two talents you've been
[56:16] faithful in the little
[56:18] things I'll make you a
[56:20] ruler now didn't brother bam tell us
[56:23] that all of this natural world here is a
[56:25] type of the spirit
[56:27] spiritual is that
[56:32] right and with that
[56:35] thought I really wonder what it's going
[56:38] to be like over
[56:40] there are we going to have cities are we
[56:43] have going to have
[56:45] Governors are we going to have
[56:49] Kings what's it going to be
[56:52] like now I've can come come up with this
[56:55] conclusion
[56:58] that it's going to be Beyond Your
[57:00] Wildest
[57:04] Dreams one little old amen over
[57:08] here all right well let me just give you
[57:11] a little more word brother bam said that
[57:13] he says there's no words in the English
[57:15] vocabulary to ever explain it you can't
[57:18] even imagine what it's going to be like
[57:21] so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it is going
[57:23] to be beyond your I don't want to say
[57:25] why
[57:26] wildest
[57:28] right because wild is you
[57:34] know beyond what you can imagine is what
[57:38] it's going to be over
[57:39] there and remember this how many knows
[57:43] we are
[57:44] here to
[57:46] train for over
[57:48] there this is a training ground this is
[57:52] a testing ground that's what this is
[57:57] amen praise the
[58:00] Lord for what's
[58:02] coming will there be cities will there
[58:05] be this will there be that well first of
[58:07] all let's look at what uh Revelations I
[58:11] believe one and
[58:12] verse uh six says or five and when and
[58:17] from Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[58:19] witness and the first begotten of the
[58:20] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[58:24] earth Prince King of the prince of the
[58:27] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[58:29] us from our sins in his own blood and
[58:32] hath made us
[58:37] Kings huh how are you all doing
[58:42] Kings believe you're a
[58:45] king you're awful
[58:48] humble Kings and Priests unto our God
[58:52] and his father to him be glory and
[58:54] Dominion forever and
[58:58] ever that's
[59:00] right will there be what what's Heaven
[59:03] going to be like well let me just read
[59:05] you the
[59:11] word Revelations 21 and 21 it says and
[59:14] the 12 gates were 12 pearls every single
[59:17] gate was of one Pearl and the street of
[59:19] the city was of pure gold streets of the
[59:21] city was pure gold as it were
[59:24] transparent glass and I saw no Temple
[59:27] therein for the Lord God Almighty and
[59:29] the lamb are the temple there of it and
[59:31] the city had no need of the sun neither
[59:33] of the moon to shine on it for the glory
[59:36] of God did lighten it and the lamb was
[59:38] the light thereof and the nations of
[59:41] them remember this is after the
[59:45] Millennium all right after the
[59:47] Millennium when a new city comes down
[59:49] out of Heaven upon the Earth cuz that
[59:51] doesn't even happen till after the
[59:53] Millennium this is when that new city is
[59:56] set up eternity brother Bram called it
[59:59] amen being the seventh day is the 7,000
[1:00:02] years but beyond that he says we go back
[1:00:04] into eternity so it's in this eternity
[1:00:07] with this city that's sitting on the on
[1:00:09] the hill and so forth is what we're
[1:00:11] reading about all right and the nations
[1:00:14] of them which are saved shall walk in
[1:00:17] the light of it and the kings of the
[1:00:19] earth do bring their Glory and Honor
[1:00:21] into it look at there we still got Kings
[1:00:25] over there
[1:00:26] just who they are I don't know but it
[1:00:28] says that we'll have Kings over there
[1:00:30] those kings of the earth do bring their
[1:00:32] Glory and Honor into it and the Gate of
[1:00:35] it shall not be shut At All by day and
[1:00:38] there shall be no night there and there
[1:00:40] shall they shall bring glory and honor
[1:00:42] of the
[1:00:43] Nations into
[1:00:47] it praise the Lord how many knows as we
[1:00:51] think about God now and what he had in
[1:00:54] his mind and what his intent was
[1:00:59] what his intent
[1:01:03] was and that is to get
[1:01:06] children have sons and daughters of
[1:01:10] God that are like
[1:01:14] himself first of
[1:01:17] all how many believes that the kingdom
[1:01:20] of God is within us now we have a
[1:01:22] kingdom we are in a kingdom and we are
[1:01:25] to subjects of that
[1:01:28] Kingdom amen and God is ruling where
[1:01:31] he's ruling in here or through here you
[1:01:35] also are ruling how many believes you're
[1:01:38] ruling how did we expect I I was
[1:01:41] thinking you know if God says that he's
[1:01:43] going to make us a ruler over many
[1:01:46] things then I figure and feel like we
[1:01:49] ought to be able to rule over the few
[1:01:51] things that we have here
[1:01:56] I got a scripture says that he that
[1:01:58] ruleth his own spirit is mightier than
[1:02:01] him that taketh a
[1:02:05] city how manyan know it's it's something
[1:02:08] else there's things that you've got to
[1:02:11] overcome because that's who God is going
[1:02:13] to live with is
[1:02:15] Overcomers not those that are
[1:02:18] defeated not those
[1:02:21] halfway not the
[1:02:23] lukewarm but those who have power
[1:02:27] how many believes you have to have
[1:02:28] authority to be a Son of God you have to
[1:02:30] have
[1:02:31] authority amen he came to his own his
[1:02:33] own received him not but as many as
[1:02:36] received him first John 1:12 I believe
[1:02:39] is are 11 amen as many as we received
[1:02:41] him to them gave he the power to become
[1:02:45] sons of
[1:02:46] God in other words
[1:02:50] Authority come on God hates a powerless
[1:02:53] church he hates a powerless people
[1:02:57] I can't help but listening to the
[1:02:59] prophet that God hates a cold farmal
[1:03:02] dead
[1:03:04] church people that claim to be
[1:03:06] Christians amen Peter said we're Lively
[1:03:11] Stones we're not dead stones we're
[1:03:14] Lively
[1:03:15] Stones this word is a Living
[1:03:18] Word flowing out from
[1:03:22] us amen so what does God do
[1:03:26] God is training us as children he takes
[1:03:30] us from
[1:03:32] childhood how many believe
[1:03:37] that to what brother bham called
[1:03:39] adoption I many remembers adoption
[1:03:41] brother BR taught adoption that just
[1:03:43] because you're born again now just
[1:03:45] because you're born again you got the
[1:03:47] Holy Ghost amen there has to be a whole
[1:03:49] lot of child training that comes with

[1:06:36] ruling it's important to have good
[1:06:39] leadership good rulers we know that from
[1:06:42] the past administration to what we got
[1:06:45] now it's very very vital to have
[1:06:48] competent
[1:06:51] leaders we ain't got competence up in
[1:06:54] there very little
[1:06:57] competence that's right all but two
[1:06:59] Democratic uh uh Senators voted that we
[1:07:03] should have boys beating up girls in
[1:07:06] games I want to say this you cannot call
[1:07:09] it women's sports
[1:07:11] anymore you have to call it men and
[1:07:14] women's
[1:07:15] sports a mixed Sports because it ain't
[1:07:18] just women's sports huh but that's just
[1:07:22] go to show you where we're at how many
[1:07:24] knows mentally as the prophet of God
[1:07:26] said people's
[1:07:28] gone you got to have R good rulership
[1:07:31] and I don't know about you but I'm
[1:07:32] looking can you
[1:07:35] imagine let me just ask you a simple
[1:07:37] question how's it going for you since
[1:07:39] the Lord ruled in your
[1:07:42] heart how many's glad my my life is just
[1:07:45] so much better with Jesus ruling up in
[1:07:49] here that's right
[1:07:55] [Applause]
[1:07:57] why we've the whole congregation
[1:08:00] everybody loud thundering said glory to
[1:08:03] God he's finally
[1:08:06] ruling and when we get to the other side
[1:08:09] and he takes charge we're going to say
[1:08:11] it ain't no Trump in there it's Jesus in
[1:08:15] there
[1:08:17] W that's right you think that's loud
[1:08:19] wait till you get to that scripture it
[1:08:21] sounded like thunder people were glad
[1:08:24] for the new ad ministration that came in
[1:08:28] there was a new
[1:08:29] rulership where IND dwelleth
[1:08:31] righteousness they not going to be wi
[1:08:34] one drop of insanity over
[1:08:37] there
[1:08:39] no and you are part of that rulership
[1:08:42] you are part of that leadership how many
[1:08:44] knows and it's very important that one
[1:08:47] thing that we take with us that he's
[1:08:50] going to live with that is character
[1:08:57] character brother BR says I counsel thee
[1:09:00] to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[1:09:03] during Revelations am me I want you to
[1:09:06] oh boy why because we know the devil was
[1:09:08] perfect and he gave it all up he didn't
[1:09:11] like that Perfection you and I are
[1:09:13] imperfect and we're thirsting for more
[1:09:16] of that
[1:09:19] Perfection we love Perfection we love
[1:09:22] Grace we love forgiveness we love God
[1:09:24] coming and cleaning us
[1:09:27] up and that's what God
[1:09:30] wants God wants us to be
[1:09:36] faithful
[1:09:38] amen because he's going to sit with us
[1:09:42] we're going to sit with him we have
[1:09:45] fellowship with him now don't we and
[1:09:48] we're going to see him face to face over
[1:09:50] there we're going to be with him in his
[1:09:52] throne according to Prophet we're not
[1:09:54] going to be out those
[1:09:56] Nations and as I begin to think on this
[1:09:59] I thought you know the scope of God's
[1:10:01] intent sometimes his motive and
[1:10:03] objective we have we we we sometimes go
[1:10:07] so
[1:10:08] extreme we think well if you're not into
[1:10:11] bride you're going to be
[1:10:13] lost well our mind we've been taught so
[1:10:17] much of that until we think that but
[1:10:19] even the prophet of God said that people
[1:10:22] will be there that we never thought
[1:10:23] would be there
[1:10:25] and people that we thought was going to
[1:10:26] be there aren't going to be
[1:10:28] there the Bible says that even on
[1:10:33] Judgment
[1:10:34] Day even on the white Throne
[1:10:38] judgment ain't that right some will be
[1:10:41] given life and some will be damned even
[1:10:45] after the Thousand Years people will be
[1:10:48] given life simply because of the Good
[1:10:50] Deeds they did to the
[1:10:52] bride huh
[1:10:55] that's why I think our mind and our
[1:10:57] scope of our thinking has to be a little
[1:10:59] broader than well it's just a
[1:11:01] bride now I want to say this that the
[1:11:04] bride is what I'm interested in I'm not
[1:11:07] re interested in giving my life in the
[1:11:09] tribulation
[1:11:10] period for my testimony and sealing my
[1:11:13] testimony with my blood and I'm not you
[1:11:16] know any of that we're not part of the
[1:11:18] Jews over there that'll give their
[1:11:21] life we want to be the Bride of Jesus
[1:11:23] Christ sitting here tonight why because
[1:11:25] we've got the material we've got the
[1:11:28] message to get us ready and that's what
[1:11:31] I desire Lord help me to be part of the
[1:11:38] Bride
[1:11:41] amen and what does it
[1:11:43] take God
[1:11:45] knew that it would take
[1:11:48] hardship
[1:11:51] struggle he wants somebody that's tried
[1:11:54] and true
[1:11:57] is that
[1:12:01] right my my my so as we think about
[1:12:06] this everything that everything about
[1:12:10] our
[1:12:11] life it's
[1:12:14] about
[1:12:16] battling is that right fighting it's
[1:12:19] about
[1:12:22] overcoming
[1:12:23] now let let me read you some
[1:12:26] more Revelations 19 when we come back
[1:12:30] brother brah says when he comes back
[1:12:31] from Heaven he comes on a white horse
[1:12:33] isn't that right and all of Heaven comes
[1:12:35] back with him on white horses is that
[1:12:38] right and I saw heaven open and behold a
[1:12:41] white horse and he that sat upon him was
[1:12:43] called faithful and true and in in
[1:12:46] righteousness do he
[1:12:48] judge and make
[1:12:52] war his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[1:12:55] on his head were many
[1:12:57] crowns how many believe there's he's got
[1:13:00] many crowns just like an athlete perhaps
[1:13:03] he'll get many gold or whatever it might
[1:13:05] be but you know he has many crowns he's
[1:13:08] King of Kings he's Lord of lords he's
[1:13:10] Redeemer he's savior he's deliverer on
[1:13:13] and on and on and on he's the captain of
[1:13:15] the hosts he's our all in all many
[1:13:18] crowns and he had a name written that no
[1:13:21] man knew but he himself and he was
[1:13:22] clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood
[1:13:24] and his name is called the the word of
[1:13:25] God and the armies which were in heaven
[1:13:27] followed him on white horses clothed in
[1:13:29] fine linen clean and
[1:13:31] white and out of his mouth goes a sharp
[1:13:34] sword that with it he should Smite the
[1:13:37] Nations and he shall rule them with a
[1:13:40] rod of
[1:13:41] iron amen and he treadeth The Wine Press
[1:13:43] of the fierceness of the wrath of
[1:13:45] almighty God Amen and on his vesture and
[1:13:49] on his thigh was a name written king of
[1:13:51] kings and Lord of lords
[1:13:56] and I saw an angel standing in the Sun
[1:14:00] and he cried with a loud voice saying
[1:14:02] let to all the fowls that fly in the
[1:14:04] midst of the heavens come and gather
[1:14:06] yourselves together unto the supper of
[1:14:08] the great God that ye may eat the Flesh
[1:14:11] of Kings and the Flesh of captains the
[1:14:13] Flesh of Mighty Men the Flesh of horses
[1:14:15] and of them that sit on them and the
[1:14:18] Flesh of all men both free and bound
[1:14:21] both small and great and I saw the
[1:14:23] beasts and the kings of the the Earth
[1:14:25] and their armies gathered together to
[1:14:27] make war against him that sat on the
[1:14:30] horse and against his
[1:14:32] army so after the S marriage SE there's
[1:14:35] going to be a big battle you and I going
[1:14:38] to be in
[1:14:39] it you don't think so go read the six
[1:14:42] seal you and I are going to be in it

[1:15:04] fear
[1:15:05] amen now notice and against his army to
[1:15:09] make war against him and the Beast was
[1:15:12] taken and with him the false prophet
[1:15:15] that wrought Miracles before
[1:15:17] him which with with which he deceives
[1:15:20] them that had received the mark of the
[1:15:22] beast and them that worshiped His image
[1:15:25] these both were cast alive into the Lake
[1:15:27] of Fire that burneth with
[1:15:29] Brimstone
[1:15:33] amen with Brimstone and the remnant were
[1:15:36] slain with the sword of him that sat
[1:15:38] upon the
[1:15:39] horse all right here's the scripture I
[1:15:42] was looking for which sword proceeded
[1:15:45] out of his
[1:15:48] mouth and all the fouls were filled with
[1:15:52] their flesh

[1:16:00] from out of his
[1:16:04] mouth how many's used

[1:16:39] mouth because how many knows amen if you
[1:16:41] want to know how to be victorious amen
[1:16:43] it is because of the word of your
[1:16:45] testimony the confession of your mouth

[1:17:20] your mouth it came out of your mouth for
[1:17:23] with the mouth conf confession is made
[1:17:25] unto salvation that's why brother bams
[1:17:28] declar declared declared that if you

[1:17:51] only way you get saved is to say Amen by
[1:17:53] his stripes no he was wounded for our
[1:17:56] our transgression bruised for our
[1:17:58] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:18:01] was upon him and he said whosoever
[1:18:04] believeth in me shall not perish but
[1:18:06] have everlasting life you speak that and
[1:18:08] you say I believe that I'm saved and

[1:18:16] down amen because the word came out of
[1:18:19] your mouth how many believes the word
[1:18:21] comes out of your mouth the sins go into
[1:18:24] the sea of his
[1:18:26] forgetfulness they're completely
[1:18:29] gone so we're used to that because a
[1:18:32] real
[1:18:35] believer oh the devil might make you

[1:19:03] Christian amen you're the kind of
[1:19:05] Christian God is looking
[1:19:07] for we're not going to come out of this
[1:19:09] Half
[1:19:10] Baked not
[1:19:15] halfway when I thought thought about the
[1:19:17] intent brother God's intention I
[1:19:21] remember to quote brother Braham said
[1:19:23] you know how that he said uh you know
[1:19:27] God makes his children
[1:19:28] Christians but sometimes they're halfway
[1:19:31] Christians but it's not God's intention
[1:19:33] for them to be that way it's their own
[1:19:35] ways they got mixed up with the plan of
[1:19:37] God in their life that's what makes them
[1:19:40] that way but God don't want them to be
[1:19:42] halfway Christians or halfway preaching
[1:19:44] he wants to be completely delivered how
[1:19:46] many God know he's preaching God wants a
[1:19:48] total Deliverance he wants us to be
[1:19:51] complete Christians
[1:19:54] woo the first thing you got to overcome
[1:19:57] the big thing you got to overcome is
[1:19:58] your
[1:20:00] mind Paul said casting every doubt every
[1:20:03] imagination casting bringing every
[1:20:05] thought into captivity to the
[1:20:11] word m that's right you might think well
[1:20:15] I ain't got much to overcome you got the
[1:20:16] biggest enemy that you'll ever have your
[1:20:18] greatest enemy is where living with
[1:20:22] you that right you had to overcome
[1:20:34] doubt and what does it happened because
[1:20:37] of that because you overcome doubt and
[1:20:40] you believe that I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:20:42] daughter of God you have to first of all
[1:20:44] and I believe that's one of the greatest
[1:20:46] things you can ever believe and to know

[1:24:00] there so the practice is now how many
[1:24:04] believe that the
[1:24:06] practice is now and not
[1:24:12] just
[1:24:14] halfway but
[1:24:16] completely and so what does God do God
[1:24:19] has to child train us if you'll notice
[1:24:23] there in Hebrews it talks about let me
[1:24:25] just go ahead we got a little bit of
[1:24:27] time let's look at Hebrews for just a
[1:24:30] second because right after he says about
[1:24:32] Jesus the author and the finisher of our
[1:24:34] faith who for the joy that was set down
[1:24:37] endure at the
[1:24:39] cross despising the same and so sat down
[1:24:42] at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:24:48] God brother baham talking about
[1:24:51] character he says even Jesus's character
[1:24:54] and that he was perfected through what
[1:24:57] he said the Bible even says that he was
[1:24:59] perfected through
[1:25:00] suffering suffering not a life of ease
[1:25:04] but
[1:25:08] suffering none of us are stupid enough
[1:25:10] to ask God to let you
[1:25:13] suffer no but we are wise enough to say
[1:25:16] God help me for whatever suffering you
[1:25:19] allow me to go
[1:25:22] through to trust trust you in
[1:25:26] it
[1:25:27] amen because that's the only way that
[1:25:30] you get to be the kind of person that
[1:25:33] God wants to live
[1:25:34] with it's through the trials and the
[1:25:36] different things that God allows to come
[1:25:40] your
[1:25:45] way this keeps coming back into my mind
[1:25:48] so I'm going to go ahead and speak it
[1:25:49] but since my wife's diagnosed and so
[1:25:52] forth
[1:25:54] life or death matter I'm here to tell
[1:25:57] you my faith has went to another
[1:25:59] level to another
[1:26:02] level and you know I've realized this
[1:26:04] one thing one thing I've
[1:26:07] realized that the kind of faith that you
[1:26:10] have for your healing if you've got the
[1:26:12] right kind of faith for your
[1:26:14] healing you trust God in every trial
[1:26:17] that comes your way is that
[1:26:21] right those things that absolutely tore
[1:26:24] you
[1:26:25] up but it molded character in
[1:26:29] you you have to have that same faith
[1:26:32] when you come down to the door of
[1:26:34] death when you get ready to die when we
[1:26:37] get ready to die it'll take that very
[1:26:40] same
[1:26:41] Faith Lord here we
[1:26:44] go I'm trusting you Lord that when I
[1:26:47] come down to that door otherwise you
[1:26:49] will be scared you will
[1:26:53] fear takes somebody that has a real hold
[1:26:56] of God to be told you're going to die
[1:27:00] and to not
[1:27:01] fear and actually go through death and
[1:27:04] never
[1:27:05] fear I remember Jo brother Joe
[1:27:07] Hendrickson in the hospital he says
[1:27:10] sometimes that fear wants to get me
[1:27:11] brother Bor but I just shrug it off say
[1:27:14] get away from here my confidence is in
[1:27:17] Jesus Christ amen cu no doubt but that
[1:27:21] fear will try to get a hold of
[1:27:23] you how many beli that's what God is
[1:27:25] looking for sons and daughters that are
[1:27:27] fearless we don't have to fear even
[1:27:29] death it doesn't matter what it is he
[1:27:31] wants that kind of character in our
[1:27:36] life and guess what how many knows that
[1:27:39] it takes a battle it takes fighting
[1:27:42] because brother Braham says character is
[1:27:44] not a free gift character is
[1:27:47] what a
[1:27:49] victory in other words think about it
[1:27:52] think about all of us who have went
[1:27:53] through a terrible bunch of
[1:28:02] stuff terrible terrible things if you
[1:28:04] live this life very long you're going to
[1:28:06] have went through some bad
[1:28:09] things but now look at
[1:28:13] yourself now that you have I don't know
[1:28:16] I don't care who and how many or what
[1:28:18] what people have done you
[1:28:21] wrong
[1:28:23] hello in your heart you say I forgive
[1:28:27] them I don't hold one thing I can tell
[1:28:30] you this from my heart right here I
[1:28:32] don't hold one thing against anybody
[1:28:34] that's ever done me
[1:28:35] wrong hello
[1:28:44] no that's right I can smile cuz if I
[1:28:50] did huh that's right some people walk
[1:28:54] around oh I hate that guy I'm a Believer
[1:28:57] but I'm tell you what
[1:29:00] huh may not even say it but if you hold
[1:29:03] that in there you're going to have that
[1:29:06] bitterness hello how many know we've got
[1:29:09] to overcome
[1:29:11] bitterness amen and if you've got that
[1:29:14] love if you've got that love of God in
[1:29:16] your heart cuz how many knows better
[1:29:18] Bram says only perfect love is going to
[1:29:21] be in there so whatever you do all of
[1:29:23] your religious acts and everything you
[1:29:25] ever did ain't going to count you've got
[1:29:27] to have perfect love he said if you're
[1:29:29] going to go in
[1:29:31] there I've said it many times I'll say
[1:29:33] it again when you get over there there's
[1:29:35] not going to be no funny feelings
[1:29:37] between
[1:29:39] people thank you Lord no funny
[1:29:45] feelings that's right and you better
[1:29:48] before you get over there you better not
[1:29:50] have those funny feelings if you want to
[1:29:52] make it in
[1:29:54] and this is just a fresh Revelation amen
[1:29:57] as God was pouring it out I said my
[1:29:59] graceous if character is a victory let's
[1:30:04] keep the
[1:30:05] victory the devil will try to rob you of
[1:30:08] that Victory he'll try to rob you of
[1:30:10] that love he'll try to rob you of your
[1:30:13] faith he'll try to rob you of
[1:30:15] longsuffering he'll try to put
[1:30:17] bitterness in there by something else
[1:30:19] that happens so when something else
[1:30:22] happened don't never let it come
[1:30:25] amen are you with me no matter what
[1:30:28] comes always put your faith in
[1:30:32] God

[1:30:42] that's the only thing you can take with
[1:30:44] you is
[1:30:46] your
[1:30:49] character how many believe that how
[1:30:52] many's glad for the character that you
[1:30:54] do
[1:30:56] have sure we should all thank God thank
[1:30:59] you Lord for the character that we
[1:31:03] have now I don't think anybody could

[1:31:27] life Lord help us with those areas
[1:31:29] isin't that right continue Lord I want
[1:31:32] that character that you're looking for
[1:31:34] that motive that you had before the
[1:31:36] foundation of the world was to be with
[1:31:39] people that live in
[1:31:43] Victory that have their character molded
[1:31:46] through the things that they go through
[1:31:48] that they've come to the place where
[1:31:51] they don't let the devil Rob them of
[1:31:53] their
[1:31:55] Victory if you're happy tonight W Glory
[1:31:59] watch out tomorrow the devil will try to
[1:32:01] rob you of that
[1:32:02] Joy if you've got peace in your heart

[1:32:07] that from you he's got all kinds of
[1:32:09] traps set out

[1:32:15] my that's right very very dangerous
[1:32:19] traps out there he's got set for
[1:32:21] everybody that's right but by God's
[1:32:24] Grace and by his
[1:32:27] Mercy we want to be the kind of people
[1:32:30] that he had intended for us to
[1:32:34] be and that's
[1:32:36] why he said as many as I love I rebuke
[1:32:43] and I chasen be zealous therefore and
[1:32:47] repent because you were born in sin
[1:32:51] shaped in iniquity you were born FAL
[1:32:53] Fallen but I'm going to take you from
[1:32:55] your Fallen State and take you out of
[1:32:58] that Fallen State and make you as
[1:33:00] righteous as God himself is righteous
[1:33:03] the devil was perfect and evil come into
[1:33:07] him all the Bible says is something I
[1:33:10] wish I would had the exact words I
[1:33:12] should shouldn't say it but something
[1:33:14] about evil was found in his
[1:33:16] heart and that right evil was found in
[1:33:19] him and what did the devil
[1:33:22] say I want to be like the most high I
[1:33:26] will Ascend above the clouds I will be
[1:33:28] like the most high he wanted to be
[1:33:30] worshiped like God was a selfish motive
[1:33:33] he had a selfish
[1:33:36] motive Lord help us God's going to take
[1:33:39] people that were junk
[1:33:46] trash deluded filthy dirty ain't that
[1:33:51] right Fallen
[1:33:53] and he picks them up cleans them up
[1:33:57] trains
[1:34:00] them because when we get over there

[1:36:39] and Magog is on the other
[1:36:42] side so after this in chapter 20 of
[1:36:45] Revelations I saw another Angel come
[1:36:46] down from heaven having the key of the
[1:36:48] bottomless pit and a great chain in his
[1:36:50] hand and he laid hold on the Dragon that
[1:36:53] old serpent which is the devil and Satan
[1:36:55] and bound him a thousand
[1:36:58] years amen cast him into the bottomless
[1:37:01] pit and shut him
[1:37:04] up amen over in Isaiah 14 he says and
[1:37:09] they shall narrowly look upon thee and
[1:37:12] say is this the guy that made that broke
[1:37:15] the Nations that caused the Nations to
[1:37:17] tremble is this the guy that did
[1:37:20] it how many knows the Devil is a person
[1:37:24] he's little imps he's got millions of
[1:37:27] little imps Little
[1:37:29] Devils that's right but one of these
[1:37:32] days we going to see him we're going to
[1:37:33] say is that the
[1:37:37] guy cast him into the bottomless pit and
[1:37:40] shut him up and put a seal on him he
[1:37:41] should deceive the Nations no more till
[1:37:44] the Thousand Years should be finished
[1:37:46] after that he is going to be loosen for
[1:37:47] a little little season and I saw
[1:37:50] Thrones and they that sat upon them and
[1:37:53] judgment was given them and I saw the
[1:37:56] souls of them that were beheaded for the
[1:37:58] witness of Jesus and for the word of God
[1:38:00] and which had not worshiped the Beast
[1:38:01] neither his image and had not received
[1:38:03] his Mark upon their foreheads or in
[1:38:05] their hands and they lived and ruled or
[1:38:09] reigned for a thousand
[1:38:12] years how's getting ready to
[1:38:15] rule that's right they ruled and they
[1:38:19] reigned for a thousand years Jesus said
[1:38:23] if you were faithful in a little I'm
[1:38:25] going to make you Faithful in a
[1:38:30] lot for a thousand years and the rest of
[1:38:34] the Dead live not until the thousand

[1:39:04] years that's
[1:39:08] right blessed and holy is he that hath
