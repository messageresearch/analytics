[30:28] in jesus name
[30:30] amen amen
[30:35] let's turn our bibles if you will and i

[30:39] first
[30:41] book of isaiah
[30:46] amen be a message we've heard before but
[30:50] i just trust that maybe
[30:51] it'll something will be said to help
[30:53] somebody
[30:54] amen in isaiah 55
[31:14] and we'll read verse 8 and
[31:17] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[31:20] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[31:23] lord
[31:24] for as the heavens are higher than the
[31:26] earth so are my ways higher
[31:28] than your ways and my thoughts
[31:31] then your thoughts amen now let's go to
[31:38] hebrews hebrew 3.
[31:51] we want to speak on god's ways
[31:55] god's ways
[31:58] hebrews 3 verse 7
[32:02] wherefore as the holy ghost saith today
[32:05] if you will hear his voice harden not
[32:08] your hearts
[32:08] as in the provocation in the day of
[32:10] temptation in the wilderness
[32:12] when your fathers tempted me and proved
[32:14] me and saw my works 40 years
[32:17] wherefore i was grieved with that
[32:19] generation and said they do
[32:21] always err in their heart and they have
[32:24] not
[32:25] known my ways so i swear in my wrath
[32:28] that they shall not
[32:29] enter into my rest
[32:33] may god it is blessed instead of reading
[32:34] the word you can be seek
[32:36] be seated
[32:40] amen talk about humility amen for one
[32:44] thing
[32:44] we want to talk about this evening with
[32:46] the help of the lord but i was listening
[32:48] to a message
[32:49] amen brother brandon preaching and he
[32:50] was preaching on the world is again
[32:53] falling apart in 1963 and he made a
[32:56] statement that kind of caught my
[32:58] attention
[32:59] and from that i began to just study and
[33:02] see what the lord would have so we'll
[33:04] see what the lord will have from that
[33:06] one little thought
[33:08] amen he was preaching of course about
[33:11] how that the world
[33:12] as before is falling apart amen
[33:16] and of course he covered everything he
[33:18] covered politics he
[33:20] covered the churches and he made a
[33:22] statement back then and i want you to
[33:24] listen to this about politics he made
[33:26] the statement he says
[33:28] our politics just couldn't get no worse
[33:35] think about that way back in 63 he said
[33:38] politics it really can't get any worse
[33:41] but we look at it today we've seen it
[33:43] get a lot worse in it
[33:45] i mean a lot worse amen
[33:49] so even he felt that way about politics
[33:52] back then also the churches in their
[33:54] condition that they had gotten into
[33:56] pentecost he mentions about how that
[33:59] they had gotten into formalism and
[34:01] and so forth and they let all kinds of
[34:03] things come in that shouldn't come in
[34:05] amen they had gotten to be real lukewarm
[34:07] and so forth he really hit that hard
[34:09] but then he makes a statement came in
[34:11] that uh
[34:12] that kind of caught my attention that
[34:14] caught me to begin to
[34:16] you know cause me to question the way
[34:19] that i think amen
[34:21] and the way that we think amen and so
[34:24] i want to i want to read that statement
[34:26] before i uh go any further
[34:29] but uh there's another thing that he
[34:31] said that i think i'll read after that
[34:33] one but
[34:34] listen to what he says he says now our
[34:35] political world
[34:37] the whole thing is corrupted our
[34:40] political world
[34:41] man-made systems and fashions he says
[34:44] and of course brother branham was just
[34:45] preaching away as you know
[34:47] real hard now he says this he says and
[34:49] we want
[34:50] everything just
[34:52] [Music]
[34:53] everything we want everything just
[34:56] everything
[34:57] so we can take it easy amen
[35:01] all right and retire he says
[35:04] and take life easy
[35:10] amen and i was like whoa you know
[35:13] and i i see this brother sisters you
[35:15] know and
[35:16] and i'll maybe share with you but retire
[35:19] and take life easy
[35:20] then he makes a statement and you should
[35:22] hear him say he says life
[35:24] wasn't intended to be easy
[35:31] life wasn't intended to be easy
[35:35] amen life is a struggle
[35:39] amen everything's got life is struggling
[35:42] isn't that right look at the trees and
[35:44] so forth you know and when we get into
[35:46] some kind of a system that takes it easy
[35:49] remember
[35:50] we're wrong amen there was another time
[35:54] brother branham was preaching about
[35:56] riches and being poor and so forth and
[35:58] you know uh
[36:00] let me just let me read this okay
[36:02] somebody came to brother batman he
[36:04] was talking about he says you know about
[36:06] taking a million and a half dollar check
[36:08] brother branham was
[36:09] handed a check hundred and one hundred
[36:12] one million five hundred thousand
[36:15] then he says man this man's worth twenty
[36:17] eight million dollars he owns big
[36:19] mission bell winery and all and i said i
[36:22] don't care how he owns
[36:23] said sir my father owns the cattle on
[36:27] on every hill i don't have any need of
[36:29] the money
[36:30] and he says well i just seeing your
[36:32] mother's home and yours here
[36:34] and parsonage and says you could use it
[36:36] and i said yes
[36:38] when i need it father will send it to me
[36:41] i don't need it now
[36:42] and i refuse to look at it a million
[36:44] five hundred thousand dollars and one
[36:46] offering
[36:46] and i'd rather take 50 cents or a dime
[36:49] from so and so and so and so
[36:51] and let everybody have a part in it then
[36:54] to take a lot of big money and headaches
[36:56] and troubles
[36:58] and then you think well it's just too
[37:00] much enough
[37:01] the curse of the love of it he says now
[37:04] i've heard him say it when he said he
[37:06] says i was born poor
[37:08] i was raised poor my people are poor
[37:11] and i want to die poor
[37:18] you go back and listen to it that's what
[37:20] he said i want to die
[37:23] poor that was the prophet of god
[37:28] amen when i caught that i began to think
[37:30] you know
[37:31] you know i wonder sometimes whether we
[37:33] really think the way that we ought to
[37:35] think
[37:36] it's time as bottom am i really thinking
[37:38] the way that i was just thinking because
[37:39] either way i feel about it i'm close to
[37:41] 60 if i don't think about my retirement
[37:43] now
[37:44] in about five years from now well you
[37:47] might think about it all you want to but
[37:48] you ain't going to do a whole lot about
[37:50] it huh
[37:53] i figure it's only smart how many knows
[37:55] it's only smart to think about your
[37:57] retirement
[37:58] isn't that what the whole good thing
[37:59] everybody really thinks about in
[38:00] retirement or
[38:01] or if not just having it easy
[38:06] just don't we all love to have it we all
[38:08] like to have it easy
[38:11] but if we can look at god and we can
[38:12] look at how did he set things up
[38:14] in that right and i'll tell you what you
[38:17] know
[38:18] um
[38:22] let me think y'all remember joey
[38:25] hendrickson when they were coming to
[38:27] church here and he was
[38:28] he was uh just retiring and i'm not sure
[38:31] if it was just a couple months out of
[38:33] retirement
[38:34] and here he found out that he has cancer
[38:38] it might not even be that long it was
[38:39] right at the point i'm not sure
[38:41] i'm thinking in the back of my mind if i
[38:43] remember right that
[38:44] just before his death he got his first
[38:47] retirement check
[38:49] just before he died if i'm right if i
[38:52] remember about he wasn't
[38:53] he was writing that time frame like that
[38:55] amen and so no doubt he worked and he
[38:57] talked to me i remember me talking to me
[38:59] about how he worked
[39:00] here amen for so many years and he had a
[39:03] good retirement coming you know and so
[39:04] forth and then
[39:05] think about what happened and so
[39:09] truly when you think you might be taking
[39:11] it easy guess what something always
[39:13] always pops up
[39:15] amen god did not intend for us to have
[39:18] it
[39:19] easy the prophet of god said so god's
[39:22] intention how many knows it's god's
[39:23] intentions
[39:24] you know just when you think you have it
[39:26] nice watch out we are in such a world
[39:29] amen and there's something else that'll
[39:31] come along
[39:32] amen but he said that another place he
[39:35] said that i was like wow
[39:36] you know and and i don't know about you
[39:38] but i don't think that any of us in here
[39:41] probably would be strong enough to say
[39:43] no don't i don't want your million and a
[39:45] half dollars
[39:49] you know you can say whatever you want
[39:50] to say right now but you know
[39:52] you'd have to be put to the test before
[39:54] you'd really know isn't that right
[39:56] that's right but brother bannon you know
[39:58] because the man was paying his tithes he
[40:00] was
[40:01] you know he called it his tithes yet
[40:03] every reason every legitimate reason
[40:05] but brother branham was so sensitive
[40:08] about money and getting into
[40:10] things like that that he wouldn't i'd
[40:12] rather i would
[40:13] i want to make sure and he always go and
[40:15] he come to a service and he'd tell him
[40:17] look i'm not here
[40:18] he's in he many times said i'd never
[40:20] take up an offering in my life
[40:22] that doesn't mean that his church didn't
[40:23] take up an offering but he never said
[40:25] look i want to need an offering will you
[40:27] take it up
[40:28] he said the closest he ever came to
[40:29] taking up an offering was
[40:31] he was in a tight place and he says look
[40:33] i hate to do this
[40:34] but i'm gonna have to pass the hat
[40:38] and he went out there and them to us
[40:40] just began to go down there and them
[40:41] little miami's you know them
[40:43] older mammies they were taking their
[40:44] nickel out and they're pinning out their
[40:46] dimes out and so forth
[40:47] and he says i was just kidding never
[40:49] mind
[40:51] you know you almost did it but he
[40:52] couldn't even do it he went and spray
[40:54] painted some bicycles and
[40:56] sold that bicycle amen and got what he
[40:58] needed to get done
[41:01] but he wanted the people to know that he
[41:02] wasn't there for the money he wasn't
[41:04] there to get rich
[41:06] because i guarantee you brother branham
[41:08] could have been a
[41:10] multi-multi-multi-millionaire
[41:12] if he had just taken money that people
[41:14] would give him
[41:16] there's a lot of people amen that wanted
[41:18] to give it to him
[41:20] but he didn't want it he wanted to stay
[41:21] simple he wanted to everybody to have it
[41:23] whenever there was an offering
[41:25] that people would take up he would
[41:26] accept an offering that people would
[41:28] take up for him
[41:29] but he wouldn't take it up himself and
[41:30] that's what he meant by that
[41:32] but he wanted everybody in there but so
[41:34] i got to think and i thought man
[41:36] you know i wonder how much you know we
[41:39] think that we were supposed to think
[41:41] and to think the way that god thinks and
[41:44] the way that he
[41:45] intends it to be so i went and i got a
[41:47] bunch of scriptures together on this
[41:48] tonight and we want to just look at it
[41:50] for a little bit because i guarantee it
[41:52] is one thing
[41:53] that you and i compared to all of the
[41:56] apostle disciples and the
[41:58] christians down through the dark ages we
[42:01] have it nice
[42:03] compared to what they did because how
[42:05] many knows john the revelator he was the
[42:07] only man
[42:08] that died of old age every last one of
[42:11] them either was crucified upside down
[42:13] paul's head was chopped off they were
[42:15] killed in one manner or other
[42:17] they were killed they had to give their
[42:19] life so it was hard
[42:21] amen it was not an easy life a christian
[42:25] life is not an
[42:26] easy life the great the good thing about
[42:29] it it doesn't matter though
[42:30] like paul was in jail amen and they had
[42:32] him in socks the good thing about
[42:34] a christian is that no matter how hard
[42:36] the struggles you go through
[42:38] no matter how many heart battles you go
[42:39] through you have somebody
[42:41] that takes care of you and it comforts
[42:43] you during that time
[42:46] amen so we want to look some scriptures
[42:49] and
[42:49] and look at the look at how we look and
[42:52] how we think about things
[42:54] compared to how god thinks about things
[42:56] you know right
[42:59] and so many times it's just the opposite
[43:03] just the opposite okay
[43:07] so i didn't bring my ink pen so i'll
[43:09] probably
[43:10] lose my way if i don't follow these
[43:13] let's look at the disciples first of all
[43:14] because
[43:15] you know we're always we as human beings
[43:18] are always looking
[43:20] at how how much we can attain how
[43:24] high we can go not right how far we can
[43:27] go
[43:27] like man he's all excited about going to
[43:29] the moon you know
[43:31] and in his space program and all these
[43:33] other things man he's always trying to
[43:35] go up higher and and so forth in status
[43:37] of life and business
[43:39] people are always wanting to become the
[43:41] vice president and then the president
[43:43] and so forth they're always trying to
[43:44] climb the ladder
[43:47] we as human beings do that isn't that
[43:49] right
[43:50] amen but you know when you think about
[43:52] it you know we just want to look at
[43:54] god's ways for a little bit
[43:56] now and the disciples were the same way
[43:58] now we know the disciples had forsaken
[44:00] all and i want to read that script after
[44:02] a while because they had forsaken all
[44:04] you know and they had sacrificed at all
[44:06] for god but in it all they knew that he
[44:08] was the messiah they knew that this was
[44:10] the messiah
[44:12] okay so in mark 9 if you want to turn
[44:15] with me let's go to mark 9.
[44:34] and along the way they had kind of
[44:36] disputed about who's going to be the
[44:38] greatest and so forth if you remember
[44:40] and verse 33 9 33 it says and
[44:43] he came to capernaum and being in the
[44:45] house he asked them
[44:46] what was it that he disputed amongst
[44:49] yourselves by the way
[44:51] amen and they held their peace in other
[44:54] words the crowd was quiet
[44:56] nobody said word
[44:59] [Laughter]
[45:01] for by the way they had disputed amongst
[45:03] themselves who
[45:04] shall be the greatest amen
[45:08] even in christianity they wanted to see
[45:12] who would be the greatest
[45:15] amen they wanted to see how who would be
[45:17] the best
[45:18] always climbing up going as high as you
[45:21] can
[45:22] and he sat down and called the twelve
[45:24] and said it unto them
[45:25] if any man desire to be the first
[45:29] the same shall be last of all
[45:34] amen in other words if you're trying
[45:38] to become somebody if you're exalted
[45:41] with pride comes before a fall
[45:43] if you try to exalt yourself god says
[45:46] you're going to be
[45:47] brought down to the base amen
[45:51] and servant of all amen
[45:54] well thank you all right y'all are on
[45:58] the ball
[46:00] so we see the disciples how they said
[46:02] that right
[46:03] now i want to go to another one over in
[46:08] matthew 19 matthew 19.
[46:25] he makes this statement in i'm just
[46:27] going to read one verse
[46:29] in chapter 19 and then we'll go to verse
[46:31] chapter 20 verse 25.
[46:34] again he says in verse 30
[46:37] many that are first shall be last
[46:40] and the last shall be first amen
[46:44] so that's one of god's ways one of god's
[46:46] ways is
[46:47] in this world those who seem to be last
[46:51] the least they're the ones that's going
[46:54] to be first
[46:56] and those that are first in this world
[46:59] are going to be last
[47:01] so it's just opposite and if you'll
[47:05] notice
[47:06] the prophet of god also made a statement
[47:08] he says you know we as human beings
[47:10] he says you know we're not like god
[47:13] because god
[47:14] is so he's greatest of all
[47:17] you know he's the greatest of all but
[47:19] yet he's so great that he can make
[47:21] himself
[47:22] little he can make himself
[47:26] a foot wash blunky the lowest job that's
[47:30] what god could do
[47:31] we as human beings we don't we have a
[47:33] hard time getting so great that
[47:35] we can actually humble ourselves and
[47:37] become small but i'll tell you what if
[47:39] you ever come get the holy ghost i mean
[47:40] if you get the holy ghost it'll make you
[47:44] little and i was just reading a quote
[47:45] back there but it says man you need to
[47:47] humble yourself
[47:48] and let everybody be else everybody else
[47:51] be better than you
[47:54] that everybody else be better than you
[47:56] because you think you're better than
[47:58] somebody else
[47:59] no that's not god's way
[48:03] and so humility with god has been all
[48:05] down through time because we know
[48:07] that david was just a sheepherder isn't
[48:09] that right he was a nobody and you just
[48:11] go on and on and on how did god choose
[48:13] chooses the foolish and those who are
[48:16] nothing of the world
[48:17] to make him something amen another
[48:19] message brother bam talked about was
[48:21] uh humble thyself is one thing uh
[48:25] paul a prisoner i believe it was another
[48:27] amen talking about the way up
[48:28] is what down amen
[48:31] the last shall be first and so forth now
[48:33] in chapter 20 verse 25
[48:36] if you'll notice notice he says but
[48:38] jesus
[48:39] called them unto him and said know ye
[48:42] that the princes of the gentiles
[48:44] exercised dominion over them
[48:48] and they that are great exercise
[48:52] authority upon them but it shall not be
[48:56] so
[48:56] among you
[49:00] but whosoever will be great among you
[49:04] let him be your minister in other words
[49:06] your servant
[49:08] people think well the preacher is the
[49:10] great one no the preacher is not
[49:11] the greatest preacher is your servant
[49:16] amen and whosoever will be
[49:19] chief among you let him be
[49:22] your servant amen
[49:27] even as the son of man came not to be
[49:29] ministered unto but to minister and to
[49:31] give his land or life
[49:33] for a ransom for all in other words
[49:39] in life people who have always demanded
[49:42] to be served and oh
[49:43] you know you know bring it to me it's be
[49:46] my you know
[49:47] serve me that's never amounted too much
[49:51] they never amounted to much
[49:53] there's nothing ever written much of
[49:55] them and jesus said i didn't come
[49:57] so everybody would fall at my enough
[49:59] you'll notice
[50:01] if if you remember jesus when he washed
[50:03] the disciples feet
[50:04] he didn't say hey i'm gonna sit down
[50:06] here you wash mine first
[50:07] he went and watched theirs he was the
[50:10] first to wash
[50:12] their feet and then he says you know
[50:14] i've given you an example that just do
[50:16] like i did god's thinking
[50:20] in god's ways he said even in isaiah
[50:24] they're not your ways are not my ways my
[50:26] ways are not your ways
[50:28] but now how many knows that through the
[50:30] baptism of the holy ghost
[50:32] that can be different through the
[50:34] baptism of the holy ghost we have his
[50:36] very life
[50:37] in us and really tonight's message is
[50:41] about
[50:42] and i think about myself because i'll
[50:43] tell you what it doesn't take long it
[50:45] didn't take much for
[50:47] us to exalt ourselves in our own eyes
[50:51] it doesn't take much to before we can
[50:53] let pride rise up or
[50:55] we can you know get to where we're
[50:57] thinking something and we're going
[50:58] higher than we should
[50:59] then god can't use us amen
[51:02] we have to my heart's desires are not
[51:05] lord
[51:06] help me to humble myself
[51:10] because the bible says he that humbles
[51:12] himself shall be exalted
[51:14] i'm not sure where it is but
[51:20] somewhere
[51:23] they asked him who is the greatest in
[51:25] the kingdom of heaven
[51:26] and he called a little child to him
[51:29] isn't that right
[51:30] and he called a little child to him
[51:33] right here it is
[51:34] matthew 18. at the same time came the
[51:37] disciples unto jesus saying
[51:39] who is the greatest in the kingdom of
[51:41] heaven
[51:43] see their mindset oh my
[51:46] hey folks let me tell you something
[51:48] you'd be amazed at how people in the
[51:50] world and in this message have that
[51:52] mindset
[51:54] about being the greatest i want to be
[51:57] the greatest
[51:58] but when you get that in your mind
[52:00] you're in for trouble
[52:02] you're fixing the fall because when you
[52:04] begin to think i want to be the greatest
[52:06] because in your mind you should be
[52:08] saying lord how can i be
[52:10] the humblest i want to be humble how can
[52:13] i serve
[52:14] [Music]
[52:15] the let me somebody feels like their
[52:17] doormat well i'm a doormat
[52:19] hey how if you really got the right let
[52:21] me see how i can serve the man that's
[52:23] the doormat
[52:25] right you want to go lower than the
[52:27] doormat man
[52:29] huh you want to just stay way down
[52:32] because paul i mean it was paul he was
[52:34] the man of us the same way i'm going to
[52:36] be great you know
[52:37] like the k ephesus and so forth paul had
[52:39] so much pride
[52:43] and he explained it later he talked
[52:45] about i was the pharisee of the pharisee
[52:47] you know i was all this that's what i
[52:49] was
[52:50] but god had to knock me off my high
[52:51] horse
[52:53] he had to knock me down
[52:56] you live a christian you let the son of
[52:58] god get to where they've got a lot of
[52:59] pride in their life
[53:01] watch out somebody's fixing to hit the
[53:04] road
[53:06] god is going to bring it down amen bring
[53:09] you down
[53:10] to where you need to be amen
[53:14] but i thought about you know we want
[53:16] everything easy god doesn't make things
[53:19] god didn't intend this world
[53:21] for us to be able to be
[53:22] multi-millionaires retire
[53:24] amen just have it easy
[53:28] god's purpose of the church is what what
[53:30] is to what is our purpose here
[53:33] what does god want us to do
[53:36] go ye into all the world and preach the
[53:38] gospel to every creature
[53:40] even better bam says not build hospitals
[53:42] and schools and college and all of this
[53:44] no go preach the gospel be a witness be
[53:46] a testimony for jesus christ
[53:48] that's what god's called us to do amen
[53:54] what as i was thinking about this sermon
[53:56] i have one little humor here
[53:58] in my sermon tonight is that all right
[54:02] um i got to thinking about the 29 no
[54:04] wait a minute it was the 29th
[54:06] chapter of matthew around verse three
[54:11] all right let me see this
[54:23] yeah jesus lays out the four
[54:26] simple simple steps to
[54:30] becoming financially independent
[54:37] huh
[54:41] all right that was the humorous because
[54:43] there is nothing 29th chapter of matty
[54:46] god never did give no four simple steps
[54:49] to doing all that
[54:52] but what he did do was blow our mind
[54:55] when he said that it is easier for camel
[54:58] to go through the eye of a needle than
[54:59] it is for a rich man
[55:01] to get into the kingdom of heaven
[55:04] and peter in them says who then can be
[55:06] saved
[55:08] amen
[55:11] because how many knows you have to
[55:13] really watch riches
[55:15] you really gotta watch these carnal
[55:18] natural worldly things because
[55:20] it will choke out the spiritual life
[55:22] right out of you and you will find
[55:24] yourself
[55:24] serving it rather than serving god
[55:29] amen nothing wrong with having something
[55:31] that god gave you
[55:33] i was reading ecclesiastes today and i
[55:36] ran across a couple things that
[55:37] i thought were pretty good it says he
[55:40] that loveth silver
[55:41] shall not be satisfied with silver nor
[55:44] he that loveth abundance
[55:45] with increase huh all right
[55:49] this also is vanity the sleep of a
[55:52] laboring man
[55:53] is sweet whether he eat a little or
[55:56] much but the abundance of the rich will
[55:59] not suffer him
[56:00] to sleep
[56:04] huh that's about right isn't it get so
[56:07] busy with riches until you don't have
[56:09] time to sleep you're worrying about
[56:10] everything
[56:11] you're thinking about everything amen
[56:15] down in verse 15 it says as he came
[56:18] forth
[56:18] of his mother's womb naked shall he
[56:21] return to go
[56:22] as he came and he shall take nothing of
[56:25] his labor
[56:26] which he may carry away in his hand
[56:29] we brought nothing into this world and
[56:31] was certainly not taking anything away
[56:36] amen
[56:42] brother brahm says i was born poor
[56:45] my people are poor i want to die poor
[56:48] the only thing i want to have when i die
[56:52] is favor with god
[56:56] that's all i want i brought nothing into
[56:58] this world it's certain we take nothing
[57:01] out
[57:03] amen so if you ever want to pray for me
[57:06] it's not
[57:07] to have money not to have big homes or
[57:10] be popular but just pray that i can stay
[57:13] in the hands of christ
[57:15] that he might mold me and make me and
[57:18] use me
[57:18] in any way that he sees fit to do amen
[57:21] in that our hearts desire
[57:24] that's what we truly desire of all the
[57:26] things that god does give us
[57:28] amen that our main ambition and goal is
[57:31] that we pray for one another
[57:33] that we're ready to go because there's
[57:36] nothing
[57:36] you're gonna you're not gonna have
[57:39] handfuls of hundred dollar bills
[57:42] no your children will get that and you
[57:44] don't know how quick they're gonna blow
[57:45] it
[57:47] huh that's what solomon said it's all
[57:48] vanity all that you ever gained all that
[57:51] you get the vain thing about it is
[57:53] you don't know whether the guy getting
[57:54] it's going to be wise or not
[57:59] amen all right let's go a little further
[58:02] is that all right
[58:05] all right
[58:12] lord help us just think the way that god
[58:14] wants us to think
[58:16] because sometimes we think so much the
[58:18] opposite way we worry
[58:20] so much about the things of the world
[58:24] it reminds me of what jesus said the
[58:25] fall of a sparrow the number of your
[58:26] hair and
[58:27] you god knows that you have need of
[58:29] these things but just keep your mind on
[58:31] god
[58:32] and his will amen
[58:36] all right i never finished this here
[58:39] verse did i which is who is the greatest
[58:42] in the kingdom of heaven
[58:44] and jesus called a little child unto him
[58:46] and set him in the midst of them huh
[58:50] the greatest we're talking about in the
[58:52] kingdom of heaven
[58:53] and he said verily i say unto you except
[58:56] ye be converted
[58:57] and become as little children you shall
[59:00] not
[59:01] enter into the kingdom of heaven
[59:07] after jesus came and did something he
[59:08] didn't do in 2000 years he deserved the
[59:11] thoughts and tense of the heart
[59:12] world over hello but yet people could
[59:16] not humble themselves
[59:19] huh and confess hey i believe that's
[59:22] jesus christ that's not just the prophet
[59:24] that's not just a man
[59:25] but that's jesus christ they got so
[59:27] lifted up in their minds and their own
[59:29] thoughts
[59:30] until they thought they were better than
[59:32] what god had sent
[59:34] better than somebody that can't even
[59:36] talk proper english
[59:38] hello they got their minds
[59:41] messed up folks and they miss god
[59:44] because they didn't do what they
[59:46] couldn't humble themselves
[59:48] how many knows it takes a lot for
[59:51] anybody
[59:52] to humble themselves to the word of god
[59:56] amen humble them you've got to humble
[59:58] yourself
[1:00:00] to the word of god to submit yourself
[1:00:02] humbling is submitting yourself
[1:00:04] none of them wanted to submit even
[1:00:07] though
[1:00:08] it was infallible it was absolutely the
[1:00:12] truth
[1:00:14] amen and what become of it was terrible
[1:00:20] amen so he said unless you become un
[1:00:23] like them become as little children we
[1:00:26] shall not enter into the kingdom of
[1:00:28] heaven whosoever therefore
[1:00:30] shall humble himself
[1:00:34] as a little child
[1:00:37] amen the same is the greatest
[1:00:41] in the kingdom of heaven
[1:00:44] humble yourself as now we know that
[1:00:46] children
[1:00:47] what did they do to the parents they
[1:00:49] just simply believe
[1:00:50] they believe what their parents said
[1:00:52] they submit themselves
[1:00:54] to the parents they're happy and content
[1:00:57] with
[1:00:58] basically doing what they're told and if
[1:00:59] you'll do that just with the kingdom of
[1:01:01] god
[1:01:02] amen hey i don't know nothing but he
[1:01:04] knows everything
[1:01:06] unless you become as a little child he
[1:01:07] says you'll never amount to much amen
[1:01:11] amen all right
[1:01:16] now
[1:01:23] all right well i didn't mark some of
[1:01:25] them out 19 and 3 we got it
[1:01:29] 20 okay we got that
[1:01:37] now we're going to go and we want to
[1:01:39] talk about
[1:01:41] again what jesus said and how he put it
[1:01:46] and how whether or not it's going to be
[1:01:48] easy or supposed to be
[1:01:50] easy for us luke turn it with me if you
[1:01:53] want to
[1:01:53] luke the sixth chapter
[1:01:57] okay and he went up into the mountain
[1:02:01] called his disciples together verse 13
[1:02:04] chose 12 of them whom he had chose and
[1:02:06] so forth
[1:02:06] and it mentions all the one he had chose
[1:02:10] luke luke 6
[1:02:18] and verse 17. and he came down with them
[1:02:21] and stood in the plane and the company
[1:02:23] of his disciples
[1:02:24] and a great multitude of people came out
[1:02:27] of all judea
[1:02:28] and jerusalem and from the sea coast of
[1:02:31] tyre and sidon
[1:02:32] which came to hear him and to be healed
[1:02:36] of their diseases
[1:02:41] and they were and they that were vexed
[1:02:43] with unclean spirits and they were
[1:02:45] healed
[1:02:46] and the whole multitude sought to touch
[1:02:48] him for there went virtue out of him
[1:02:51] and he healed them all
[1:02:55] so we had a great healing campaign isn't
[1:02:57] that right
[1:02:58] great multitude came they were all
[1:03:02] healed then he lifted up his eyes
[1:03:05] on his disciples and said
[1:03:10] blessed be ye
[1:03:13] poor how many knows
[1:03:17] that's truly what the disciples were
[1:03:19] even jesus was poor
[1:03:21] huh you know and when you preach about
[1:03:24] being poor this is why i said earlier i
[1:03:27] was going to mention that my wife could
[1:03:29] give you a testimony
[1:03:30] that some preachers and this is the
[1:03:32] thing of it how many knows that
[1:03:33] uh whether it's the bible or whether
[1:03:35] it's things brother banh said about
[1:03:37] retirement well
[1:03:38] but about or should i just not worry
[1:03:40] about my retirement should i just not do
[1:03:42] i don't think that that's what the
[1:03:43] prophet was saying
[1:03:45] huh no
[1:03:49] do you think jesus said blessed are the
[1:03:50] poor so hey i better work on being poor
[1:03:54] huh see we had preachers in the message
[1:03:57] already to take things so far out of
[1:03:59] context
[1:04:01] until they think it they make it make it
[1:04:03] a religion
[1:04:04] they make it to where that's how you got
[1:04:06] to be
[1:04:07] but you better have a balance on it
[1:04:09] because if you don't get a balance on it
[1:04:10] hello that don't mean if god gives you
[1:04:13] something it means for you to have a lot
[1:04:15] of money
[1:04:16] that you don't have a lot of money hello
[1:04:20] but if you are let me say if you are
[1:04:22] poor on account of following the gospel
[1:04:24] you're a blessed person
[1:04:27] huh when it causes you to you know take
[1:04:30] persecution
[1:04:31] on the count of the gospel watch out
[1:04:34] amen that's that you're a blessed person
[1:04:36] for yours is the kingdom of god and
[1:04:39] blessed
[1:04:40] are ye that hunger now for ye shall be
[1:04:42] filled
[1:04:44] you see how bug out jesus said look it
[1:04:46] may not be easy
[1:04:47] you might not have it either you know
[1:04:48] how many of those in the dark
[1:04:50] ages that were hungry that they didn't
[1:04:53] have
[1:04:54] a home that they had hide in caves and
[1:04:58] give their lives
[1:04:59] even one place he says you know be
[1:05:01] faithful unto death
[1:05:03] you're going to have tribulation the
[1:05:06] bible says about tribulation and things
[1:05:07] like that
[1:05:09] amen but listen if you are
[1:05:13] on account of the gospel hungry
[1:05:17] now let me can i stop for a minute
[1:05:20] because look at look at israel how many
[1:05:22] knows when
[1:05:22] god bought them out of egypt they had a
[1:05:25] dead a jamboree
[1:05:28] they had to dance and scream and shout
[1:05:30] in time
[1:05:31] whenever they came out of egypt is that
[1:05:34] right
[1:05:35] and then god came and takes him right
[1:05:37] down to the red sea
[1:05:39] where they couldn't go any further
[1:05:42] huh they led him right into a trap
[1:05:47] see it's god's ways israel didn't
[1:05:49] understand god's ways now i don't know
[1:05:51] about you but
[1:05:52] it is really wonderful if you understand
[1:05:55] god's ways because if you don't
[1:05:56] understand god's ways
[1:05:58] you're not going to know how to react or
[1:06:00] act
[1:06:02] just like trials that come our way if
[1:06:04] you don't know that hey god's going to
[1:06:05] allow those things to happen
[1:06:09] if you don't understand god's ways and
[1:06:11] he is going to test you
[1:06:12] he is going to try you the bible says
[1:06:15] every son that comes to god
[1:06:16] must be tested must be tried must be
[1:06:19] chastened
[1:06:20] every son no grandson nobody's exempt
[1:06:26] huh well there we've had an evening like
[1:06:28] tabernacle we've got a lot of people go
[1:06:30] through
[1:06:30] some hard times but there's a few of us
[1:06:32] that's never had a trial
[1:06:35] can't say that can we no because every
[1:06:38] son
[1:06:38] every daughter that comes to god has to
[1:06:40] be tested as we tried
[1:06:41] and they didn't israel didn't understand
[1:06:44] god's ways
[1:06:46] god's way is to not always let it be
[1:06:48] nice
[1:06:50] not always let it be easy
[1:06:53] amen
[1:06:56] and so he allowed them come into that
[1:06:58] trap and couldn't go forward they had to
[1:07:00] trust god
[1:07:01] and after they went through that and god
[1:07:03] did oh my
[1:07:04] the miracle of parting the red sea going
[1:07:07] across on dry land
[1:07:08] coming out the other side looking back
[1:07:11] and here comes the chariots and here
[1:07:13] comes the spears and here comes the
[1:07:15] whole army of egypt coming through there
[1:07:18] and all of a sudden the waters gush down
[1:07:24] i don't know about you brother glenn but
[1:07:27] i'm here to tell you
[1:07:28] if i'd have been pharaoh and god parted
[1:07:31] the waters for them to make it through
[1:07:34] i would have my doubts that he means for
[1:07:36] me to get through that
[1:07:38] right i'd say no way we're going down in
[1:07:41] there
[1:07:42] really no way let's go back home let
[1:07:46] them guys go
[1:07:47] no not pharaoh he's one well i don't
[1:07:50] want to say stupid but
[1:07:54] what a general whenever god does a
[1:07:57] miracle like that and they're like
[1:07:59] wow how can that even be
[1:08:03] huh i think i'll try it
[1:08:07] not a good not good but somehow other
[1:08:10] even the bible talks about god hardening
[1:08:12] his art
[1:08:15] amen maybe god had to harden his head
[1:08:18] he had to make him uh you know hardhead
[1:08:21] now we're coming after you we ain't
[1:08:22] giving up that easy
[1:08:24] huh come into there and what happened
[1:08:29] here comes the water and washed them all
[1:08:31] away they came over to the other side of
[1:08:33] the river
[1:08:35] miriam i don't have a tambourine up here
[1:08:37] she began to
[1:08:41] and all the sisters oh they all follow
[1:08:44] everybody oh
[1:08:46] praise be to god moses wrote a song if i
[1:08:49] ain't wrong about somebody
[1:08:50] about how they got it for all of his
[1:08:53] enemies
[1:08:54] they had a good time but god don't mean
[1:08:57] for you just to have a good time
[1:09:00] he does mean for you to have a good time
[1:09:01] but then it wasn't long isn't that right
[1:09:04] he got in out into the wilderness and
[1:09:06] there's no water
[1:09:10] what a horrible general huh moses what
[1:09:13] is wrong with you taking us out into
[1:09:15] this desert here
[1:09:16] where there ain't no water i am thirsty
[1:09:18] i don't know about you but
[1:09:20] water is something we can't do without
[1:09:25] amen but all god was looking for was
[1:09:29] hey don't matter blessed are you when
[1:09:32] you're hungry for the kingdom of god
[1:09:34] blessed are you if you come up against a
[1:09:36] wall that you can't cross
[1:09:38] praise be to god anyway amen
[1:09:43] moani's going through some really really
[1:09:45] hard times again
[1:09:46] only thing i know i have to do is when
[1:09:48] one one piece of advice that i gave him
[1:09:50] i said look why don't you just start
[1:09:51] praising be to god
[1:09:53] praise be to god my heart's be to god
[1:09:57] it'll chase all the devils away of
[1:10:00] torment and everything else hello
[1:10:02] does anyone hear it if israel would have
[1:10:04] just
[1:10:05] praised the lord god's able he took us
[1:10:08] out of
[1:10:08] egypt he's able to do it i
[1:10:12] don't doubt but they'd be in heaven
[1:10:13] nowadays but remember the bible said
[1:10:16] because they did understand my ways i
[1:10:18] swore
[1:10:19] in my wrath that they will not enter
[1:10:22] into my rest
[1:10:24] they're not coming home here i'm going
[1:10:26] to have doubters up here
[1:10:29] amen after all that god did both hunger
[1:10:32] and thirst after righteousness huh
[1:10:36] blessed are you to hunger now for you
[1:10:39] shall
[1:10:40] be filled amen when you're starving and
[1:10:43] hungry no doubt
[1:10:45] there's a many a little child many of
[1:10:47] mother
[1:10:48] father parents that were having hungry
[1:10:51] for the kingdom of god's sake
[1:10:53] don't worry over there there's gonna be
[1:10:55] plenty of food
[1:10:57] in other words jesus said in this world
[1:11:00] you're probably going to have it rough
[1:11:02] it's not going to be easy amen
[1:11:09] and think about this coming off of here
[1:11:10] this is what he's telling them
[1:11:12] i'm going to give you flowery better
[1:11:14] people thank you become a christian it's
[1:11:16] a flowery bed of ease it's not
[1:11:19] but god gives you grace through it all
[1:11:23] that hunger now for you shall be filled
[1:11:24] blessed are ye that weep
[1:11:26] now amen for
[1:11:29] ye shall laugh
[1:11:33] amen i believe that's part of the reason
[1:11:37] that brother brahm said god didn't
[1:11:39] intend
[1:11:40] for things to be easy because he knew
[1:11:43] they would be hard
[1:11:45] yet you and i let me tell you how many
[1:11:47] believes that god has made it we have it
[1:11:48] nice
[1:11:51] we have it too nice
[1:11:57] don't let that niceness take you away
[1:12:00] from god
[1:12:03] blessed are ye when men shall
[1:12:06] love you no hate you and when they shall
[1:12:09] separate you from their company
[1:12:11] and shall reproach you and cast out your
[1:12:14] name is evil
[1:12:16] ain't nobody gonna be called calling me
[1:12:19] evil
[1:12:20] huh yeah they are people's going to call
[1:12:22] you evil who's going to
[1:12:24] make you evil look evil for
[1:12:27] the son of man's sake amen
[1:12:31] rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy
[1:12:33] for behold your reward is great in
[1:12:36] heaven for in the like manner did their
[1:12:39] fathers
[1:12:40] unto the prophets
[1:12:43] but woe unto you that are rich you have
[1:12:46] you received your consolation
[1:12:50] how many knows that so many times
[1:12:54] people who are rich trust in their
[1:12:57] riches
[1:12:59] people that want to be rich because you
[1:13:02] feel like hey you're secure you're
[1:13:03] you're good to go
[1:13:06] huh you've got a i don't even know about
[1:13:09] a 401k
[1:13:11] and all that i guess it's some kind of
[1:13:12] retirement fund and all of that
[1:13:14] i got 2 million dollars in my 401k i'll
[1:13:17] tell you what
[1:13:18] at 65 i'm gonna sit back i'm gonna go
[1:13:20] bass fishing
[1:13:23] i'm gonna go take it easy huh
[1:13:27] what did the bible say over in james i
[1:13:30] think
[1:13:30] that the rich are not to trust in their
[1:13:33] riches those who
[1:13:34] few who are rich don't trust in your
[1:13:36] riches
[1:13:38] but use it to distribute to saints of
[1:13:41] necessity and so forth
[1:13:43] never i use it right but people intend
[1:13:47] to
[1:13:47] think that it brings security don't
[1:13:49] trust in your riches
[1:13:51] no sir people
[1:13:54] trust in it war unto you that are full
[1:13:58] for ye shall hunger will unto you that
[1:14:01] laugh
[1:14:02] now for ye shall mourn and weep
[1:14:06] war to you and men shall speak well of
[1:14:08] you for so did
[1:14:11] did their fathers to the false prophets
[1:14:14] amen but i say unto you which here
[1:14:19] love your enemies do good to them which
[1:14:22] hates you
[1:14:23] huh so contrary to our nature to the way
[1:14:26] we think isn't it
[1:14:28] because without the holy ghost let me
[1:14:29] tell you something you will not
[1:14:31] love your enemy now you'll
[1:14:34] try to try to comply but it won't be
[1:14:36] there
[1:14:38] it has to be there bless them that curse
[1:14:42] you and pray for them which despitefully
[1:14:45] use you
[1:14:46] and unto him that smiteth thee on the
[1:14:48] cheek offer also the other
[1:14:51] and him that taketh away thy cloak
[1:14:53] forbid not to take thy coat
[1:14:54] also amen give unto every man that
[1:14:58] asketh of thee and of him that taketh
[1:15:00] away thy goods
[1:15:01] ask them not again and as you would that
[1:15:05] men should do to you
[1:15:07] do ye also unto them likewise
[1:15:10] how many knows that's pretty much the
[1:15:11] golden rule of christianity
[1:15:14] golden rule of christianity is to do to
[1:15:16] others as you would have others do
[1:15:18] to you i mean it covers it all
[1:15:21] i believe in galatians says he that
[1:15:22] loveth his neighbor has
[1:15:25] has fulfilled the law and all this
[1:15:27] commandment hang all along the prophets
[1:15:29] if you do that as a christian you
[1:15:31] probably do all right
[1:15:32] man because you're always trying to do
[1:15:34] whatever you would want others to do to
[1:15:36] you
[1:15:37] amen and then notice
[1:15:41] do them likewise and if you love them
[1:15:43] which love you what thank have ye
[1:15:45] for sinners also love those that love
[1:15:48] them that is so hard to do in the human
[1:15:52] realm is that right to love the ones
[1:15:55] that don't
[1:15:56] love you and if you do good to them that
[1:16:00] do good to you what thank have you for
[1:16:02] sinners
[1:16:03] also do the same
[1:16:06] amen praise the lord
[1:16:10] so we see that god dwells in humility
[1:16:13] god dwells how many knows to do all
[1:16:16] these things that we just read
[1:16:18] takes humility
[1:16:22] i was reading a little bit about
[1:16:26] isuzu street and the revival there and
[1:16:29] back then
[1:16:30] some of the black folks couldn't even go
[1:16:32] inside the church to listen to the
[1:16:34] preaching
[1:16:35] and to hear the teaching but it says you
[1:16:37] know instead of being proud and no i
[1:16:39] ain't going to do that
[1:16:40] they would actually some of the ones
[1:16:41] that became great and renowned
[1:16:44] amen and wanted they humbled themselves
[1:16:46] and they would go outside of the door
[1:16:48] and sit there on the doorstep listen see
[1:16:50] what they could hear
[1:16:53] i had to think that's humility and it
[1:16:54] talked about how humble
[1:16:56] how they humbled themselves hey if i can
[1:17:00] i'm going to get what i can if i can't
[1:17:01] give them sights of bread but they were
[1:17:02] so dedicated to god they were hungry
[1:17:05] hungry for god amen and they humbled
[1:17:08] themselves
[1:17:10] amen just a couple of scriptures on
[1:17:14] on something brother branham said both
[1:17:16] in uh
[1:17:17] i mean different one different places
[1:17:19] brother bam says but a real listen
[1:17:21] but a real big man makes himself
[1:17:25] small that shows that the god of heaven
[1:17:28] made himself a foot wash
[1:17:30] flunk washer to mankind he says the way
[1:17:33] up
[1:17:34] is down if you want more of god
[1:17:37] you have to find a way to humble
[1:17:39] yourself more
[1:17:41] he that humbleth himself shall be
[1:17:43] exalted amen
[1:17:46] and he says that's what's the matter
[1:17:48] with people today they don't want to
[1:17:49] accept the humility
[1:17:51] of the gospel but abraham someone said
[1:17:54] brother
[1:17:55] how do you see visions he said it's not
[1:17:57] me see
[1:17:58] you got to get yourself out of the
[1:18:01] picture
[1:18:04] god made a promise god's got to stay
[1:18:06] with that promise
[1:18:07] but you've got to be simple enough to
[1:18:10] get away
[1:18:11] and out of your own way
[1:18:15] how many believes that we have to get
[1:18:17] out of our own ways
[1:18:19] again the way to know god
[1:18:22] is to get simple because how many knows
[1:18:25] that's how a childish
[1:18:26] a child is just simple-minded
[1:18:30] many times if you come to church and you
[1:18:33] listen to the preacher
[1:18:37] if you just take it into simplicity that
[1:18:40] it's given
[1:18:41] simply believe in that right it'll bless
[1:18:44] you
[1:18:44] but if you sit back there and you
[1:18:46] analyze it
[1:18:47] and you begin to think yeah but over
[1:18:49] here and over there
[1:18:51] stay simple the more i can get
[1:18:55] myself simple the more god can use me
[1:18:58] my god can talk to me but i'm here to i
[1:19:02] you know the other day i was uh
[1:19:06] filling up my gas tank at the gas
[1:19:09] station
[1:19:10] and all of a sudden a car with a loud
[1:19:13] muffler a mustang you know
[1:19:14] took out of there and he wanted
[1:19:16] everybody to hear he had a loud muffler
[1:19:18] you know
[1:19:20] here comes a woman ill fame dressed or
[1:19:22] whatever she had her dress on and
[1:19:24] everything but she was fussing at her
[1:19:25] husband
[1:19:26] you know you didn't give me enough money
[1:19:29] you know
[1:19:29] and she went over there and just carried
[1:19:32] on you know how
[1:19:32] world is the only drama they have is
[1:19:35] what they create
[1:19:37] i was just standing you know pumping the
[1:19:40] gas thinking
[1:19:41] praise the lord i don't even hear
[1:19:44] and i got to think about the prophet of
[1:19:46] god says you know when you go into
[1:19:47] jakarta glory when you get back there
[1:19:49] behind the veil the veil drops
[1:19:51] and all the noise of the world you don't
[1:19:53] even hear it
[1:19:55] i thought i don't even hear all that i'm
[1:19:58] behind the veil in god i'm resting in
[1:20:00] peace
[1:20:01] you know they're out there carrying on
[1:20:04] trying to prove things and having all
[1:20:05] their drama but i thought you know thank
[1:20:07] god for
[1:20:08] being behind that veil the words all
[1:20:10] just shut up
[1:20:12] shut in with god doesn't affect you
[1:20:14] doesn't you know
[1:20:16] praise the lord just want to be at that
[1:20:18] place where god
[1:20:20] can speak to your heart and lead you can
[1:20:22] guide you
[1:20:23] he can bless you you know
[1:20:26] how many is glad for that that's where i
[1:20:29] want to be
[1:20:31] how that we might know god get simple
[1:20:34] the way up is down amen he says he that
[1:20:38] humbles himself
[1:20:39] shall be exalted and he that exalt
[1:20:41] himself shall be abased
[1:20:43] we must humble ourselves try not to mode
[1:20:46] know
[1:20:47] too much amen
[1:20:50] you're smart but you don't have to be
[1:20:52] smart you can think of all kinds of
[1:20:54] stuff
[1:20:55] but don't think of all kinds of stuff
[1:20:57] just get your mind on the word and on
[1:20:59] the simplicity of the gospel
[1:21:01] you'll be a whole lot better off let all
[1:21:02] the riff raff amen
[1:21:04] i believe everything outside of the holy
[1:21:06] spirit speaking to you
[1:21:07] is there so much noise out there
[1:21:11] everything else is noise
[1:21:15] except the holy slinger let's look if
[1:21:18] you want more of me
[1:21:19] you're going to have to find a way to
[1:21:21] humble yourself a little more you're
[1:21:22] going to have to go a little
[1:21:23] lower here because down here is where
[1:21:24] i'm at people can know how to do send
[1:21:27] people to the moon
[1:21:28] but they can't figure out what makes the
[1:21:29] blade of the grass grow
[1:21:31] it's actually god that causes that life
[1:21:34] to grow
[1:21:35] amen no sooner listen
[1:21:39] we must humble ourselves try not to know
[1:21:41] too much just know one thing
[1:21:43] focus everything else out of the way
[1:21:48] and look onto christ if you don't know
[1:21:51] how to write your name how many knows
[1:21:52] peter couldn't even write his name
[1:21:56] that don't have one thing to do with it
[1:21:59] just focus your heart on christ
[1:22:01] and watch out and see what happens
[1:22:06] peter said one place after he said with
[1:22:10] men this is impossible as far as
[1:22:12] rich man entering in and then to answer
[1:22:14] peter said unto him behold
[1:22:16] we have forsaken everything we've given
[1:22:19] it all up
[1:22:21] sometimes i wonder if we've given it all
[1:22:22] up to let
[1:22:24] christ have first place in our life
[1:22:27] and follow thee what shall we have
[1:22:30] therefore
[1:22:31] huh in other words what's our reward
[1:22:34] we've forsaken all the folly

[1:22:40] that ye which have followed me in the
[1:22:43] regeneration when the son of man shall
[1:22:45] sit in the throne of his glory

[1:23:11] we were looking for him why didn't he
[1:23:13] accept him

[1:23:28] christian wife you don't forsake him
[1:23:31] you have a christian husband you don't
[1:23:32] forsake them but those who had to
[1:23:35] because of the sake of the gospel

[1:23:40] sake shall receive a hundred fold
[1:23:43] and shall inherit everlasting
[1:23:48] life and he says conclusively

[1:24:46] father

[1:24:49] realize that we truly want more of you
[1:24:51] lord
[1:24:52] and we understand your ways father how
[1:24:54] that if we want more we have to go
[1:24:56] further down lord to get it
[1:24:58] we have to die to our own ways our own
[1:25:00] thinking more and keep our minds just
[1:25:02] simple
[1:25:02] don't let the devil come in and put
[1:25:04] questions and all kinds of
[1:25:05] genealogies and all kinds of different
[1:25:08] things in there but
[1:25:09] just simply follow the word just keep
[1:25:12] our
[1:25:12] focus on you lord jesus and off of the

[1:25:52] we ask god that you would show each and
[1:25:54] every individual
[1:25:56] an area of our life that perhaps we
[1:25:58] could humble ourselves more
[1:26:00] that we could base ourselves more father
[1:26:03] so that you could use this in a greater
[1:26:05] way and how that we could be closer to
[1:26:07] you
[1:26:08] how we could walk with you so that truly
[1:26:11] the world would be shut out
[1:26:13] and we'd be shut in with god in that
[1:26:15] secret place
[1:26:16] lord jesus we ask god that you just
