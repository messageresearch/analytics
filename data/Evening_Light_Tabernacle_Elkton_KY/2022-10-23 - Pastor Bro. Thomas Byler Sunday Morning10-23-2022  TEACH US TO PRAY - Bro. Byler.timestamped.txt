[29:11] brothers and sisters
[29:13] we'll just stand this morning
[29:17] maybe Brother Brad will open us in
[29:19] prayer this morning
[29:40] again the first thing
[29:56] to presented to the words
[30:09] and children can be dismissed for Sunday
[30:11] school and if you go in the Psalms with
[30:14] me to Psalms 118.
[30:25] Psalms 118 and we're gonna just start in
[30:28] verse one we'll read up to verse 15.
[30:32] Psalms 118.
[30:34] oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is
[30:37] good because his mercy endureth forever
[30:40] foreign
[30:44] forever
[30:54] called upon the Lord in distress the
[30:56] Lord answered me and sent me in a large
[30:58] place
[31:05] lord taketh my park with them that help
[31:08] me therefore shall I see my desire upon
[31:10] them that hate me
[31:12] which is
[31:18] I trust in the Lord than to put
[31:19] confidence in princes
[31:28] they compassed me about yea they Compass
[31:30] me about but in thy name in the name of
[31:33] the Lord I will destroy them
[31:45] now as thrust store at me that I might
[31:47] fall but the Lord helped me
[31:49] the Lord is my friend
[31:51] called
[31:55] this one together the voice of rejoicing
[31:57] in Salvation is in the Tabernacles of
[32:00] the righteous the right hand of the Lord
[32:03] doeth valiantly God bless you may be
[32:06] seated brother Brian
[32:17] brothers and sisters so after reading
[32:21] that psalm
[32:22] this morning I sure hope there's none of
[32:25] us putting any trust in governments or
[32:27] princes or people that your trust is in
[32:30] the Lord this morning uh if you return
[32:33] with me
[32:34] maybe do something different I'm going
[32:37] to try to go three places I know I go
[32:39] all over the place uh first John the
[32:41] first
[32:43] and then First Corinthians the 10th
[32:45] chapter
[32:47] and then uh the Epistle of John the
[32:50] first chapter of the third verse but I
[32:53] was listening to a message this morning
[32:57] um before I come here but I was just
[32:59] thinking about that song we were reading
[33:01] you know
[33:04] if there's nothing you can trust in this
[33:06] life that will get you over on the other
[33:08] side I mean it's not things are there's
[33:11] God wants you to prosper I want you to
[33:14] have a good life while you're walking
[33:16] the face of the Earth but that should
[33:18] not be your only desire your desire
[33:21] should be to him and to serve him this
[33:24] morning and I was just thinking there
[33:26] you know
[33:28] brother Branham taught some messages he
[33:30] said if God is with us where are all the
[33:32] Miracles and as we come to this year
[33:35] 2022 a few months from going to 2023 or
[33:40] oh it's not God's fault there are no
[33:43] Miracles a lot of times you got to
[33:45] examine yourself and and look into your
[33:48] own life why God might not be doing for
[33:51] you the things that you think he should
[33:53] be doing for you but now it's not I do
[33:56] this and he does that relationship it's
[33:59] the opposite you just give all your
[34:01] confidence and love and put it in him
[34:04] and then he'll bring about the
[34:06] circumstances in your life that he
[34:08] desires to see that's the hard thing
[34:10] about the human the human man a woman
[34:13] wants their own way sometimes and not
[34:16] God's way and it's you got to get to a
[34:18] point and wrestle where you know what
[34:21] God's way for you is and the life that
[34:24] we live but I was also thinking you know
[34:27] God cares about everything you do every
[34:29] place you go every the people you deal
[34:32] with God cares about every situation in
[34:34] your lifetime you know a lot of people
[34:36] say that and I believe that but
[34:39] sometimes if we forget about that in our
[34:41] daily Journey as we go through life you
[34:44] know and I was just thinking you know I
[34:46] had an inch you know you know
[34:49] circumstances brought back to this place
[34:52] and and if I hadn't been there that day
[34:57] when they turned the national gas back
[35:00] on my company right now would be
[35:02] probably facing all kinds of
[35:04] multi-million dollar lawsuits so God
[35:07] does care about you you know
[35:10] you know I was there when we turned the
[35:11] gas on and the unit started flaming up
[35:14] so God does care about you he does bring
[35:17] about circumstances you know I was there
[35:19] I was fortunate that I was there just to
[35:22] be there at that unit when it started
[35:24] flaming up or it would have been a total
[35:26] different story that day if I had not
[35:28] been there so God cares about every
[35:31] portion of your life but I was thinking
[35:33] but I was and also listening to another
[35:36] message this morning
[35:38] but I was just thinking about that and
[35:41] a lot of times it's
[35:43] our fault not his fault if we believe I
[35:47] actually
[35:48] believe what brother random taught and
[35:50] we believe Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the
[35:54] same yesterday today and forever then
[35:57] what are you worried about you know what
[35:59] do you you should they're not to say
[36:00] that you wouldn't have anxiety maybe a
[36:03] little fear would try to take over you
[36:05] need to push that away we're not perfect
[36:07] we're all making mistakes but I was
[36:10] listening to that message also this
[36:12] morning when we think of when I
[36:14] mentioned that earlier about governments
[36:16] and princes and everything
[36:20] you know now they're they're I'm I'm not
[36:23] gonna go off on a deep end but they're
[36:25] just totally perverted now that
[36:27] continually all they do and it's to the
[36:30] point like the brother Thomas was saying
[36:33] and the other brother was saying that we
[36:36] it's you know we always thought when you
[36:39] think of Sodom and Gomorrah
[36:42] you know that could never happen again
[36:44] but it is happening again they're here
[36:47] force you to either believe something or
[36:51] not be able to buy and sell and you can
[36:52] see it going on right now where they're
[36:55] trying to force you to believe in
[36:57] knowledge ideology in a way or you're
[36:59] not going to be able to buy and sell now
[37:01] let's listen to this not trying to be
[37:03] funny this morning now it's listening to
[37:06] that message this morning and it's this
[37:08] day the scripture is fulfilled in
[37:11] February 19 1965.
[37:14] and we all know that if brother Branham
[37:16] was on Twitter today or if he was on
[37:19] Facebook or you know that he'd be
[37:21] blocked just like the rest of us would
[37:23] because
[37:25] if you he was preaching in that message
[37:27] about Hollywood
[37:29] and homosexuality well you all know that
[37:32] that would not be received but
[37:35] when you think of it he was preaching
[37:38] about something in 1965
[37:40] you know it's just six years old some of
[37:42] us weren't even born some of us were
[37:44] were probably 20 or 30 years old I don't
[37:46] know what your circumstances in your age
[37:48] in 1965 but he was preaching hard about
[37:52] that and
[37:53] in California in 1965 and look where
[37:57] we're at today in 2022 so if you have
[38:00] any hope of things getting better
[38:01] they're not going to get better and I
[38:04] and
[38:05] it really struck me
[38:07] when you when you listen to the message
[38:09] of the hour
[38:10] and you know I wasn't alive I wasn't a a
[38:13] mature man then when he was preaching
[38:15] the message but when you think of what
[38:17] he was preaching how it must you know
[38:19] sometimes I'm not saying it did but it
[38:21] must have just completely went over the
[38:23] people's heads sometimes and now here in
[38:26] the year 2022 you can see that's the
[38:29] scriptures are being fulfilled daily
[38:31] before our lives the way the world is
[38:34] going but changing a little thought here
[38:36] going to first John not wanting to jump
[38:39] around a lot I'll read these first four
[38:43] 15 verse is here and uh but let me let
[38:48] me read this because this this I have a
[38:50] lot more meaning why why I'm reading
[38:52] these three chapters this morning
[38:54] you are what you think you are you are
[38:56] what you think about 24 hours a day now
[38:59] I I don't know what you're thinking or
[39:02] Waning you think bad things or when you
[39:04] but what you find yourself thinking
[39:06] about 24 hours a day what consumes your
[39:10] mind where
[39:13] deep in your mind
[39:15] are true you're going to be you're going
[39:17] to bring become whatever you're thinking
[39:19] about
[39:21] you're going to bring in this um
[39:23] this Lutheran preacher had this this is
[39:27] years and years and years ago what a man
[39:30] thinks of himself how you think of
[39:32] yourself this morning
[39:34] you're going to walk into that however
[39:36] you think about it if you think of
[39:38] yourself as a Son of God that's what
[39:40] you're going to be this morning because
[39:42] you're going to be willing to do the
[39:43] things that make you a son or a daughter
[39:46] of God but I'll just read to what he had
[39:49] in this devotional he had said here and
[39:51] it goes and uh the Epistle of John that
[39:55] third chapter in the second verse
[39:58] but I said in our present situation we
[40:01] Face a task which is
[40:04] spiritual in its nature because it's
[40:06] life and death struggle between two
[40:09] opposing ways of life so he's talking in
[40:11] a spiritual sense between good and evil
[40:14] and at the same time World War II is
[40:16] going on so these young men in a natural
[40:18] way were going to we're going to have to
[40:21] face that but in a spiritual way as us
[40:24] as Sons and Daughters of God we go
[40:26] through the same thing it's
[40:27] contemplating that is a diseases and
[40:30] considered the larger General aspects
[40:31] than to get it is to consider oneself
[40:34] but what a man thinks of himself will
[40:37] largely determine the service toward the
[40:40] victory of which he strives and pray
[40:43] so he's and John says we are sons of God
[40:47] back in the beginning of time when Man
[40:49] was created God breathed within him the
[40:51] man became a loving soul we're all a
[40:54] living Soul this morning and he goes on
[40:56] not losing my place Jesus called men
[40:58] children of God for he had taught us to
[41:01] pray saying our father no higher thought
[41:03] of man is possible than this what a man
[41:06] thinks of himself as a form
[41:09] well he's going he's changing him when
[41:12] he says this wonder man thinks of
[41:13] himself as a form of an animal which the
[41:16] beastly nature asserting itself he will
[41:19] live and act as an animal when a man
[41:21] thinks of himself merely as a servant of
[41:23] a higher Earthly power be it the state
[41:26] of anything else he becomes a slave to
[41:29] that I'm paraphrasing here a slave to
[41:32] that power it is drawn from the
[41:34] god-given Heritage but we Christians
[41:36] Americans know that we are children of
[41:39] God Heirs of Christ you have joined
[41:41] hairs with him and God when Jesus says
[41:43] Be You therefore forgiven as your father
[41:45] which in heaven is perfect he set the
[41:48] standard for our attainment man is
[41:50] supreme he is to live Liberty and
[41:53] freedom and all good things of life here
[41:55] indeed is the vital thing concerning
[41:57] what a man should think himself man made
[42:00] in the image of my God that is it we are
[42:03] followers and workers with God and God
[42:05] is always with us to give us strength
[42:07] and courage in his spirit and I was uh
[42:10] thought just talked to me this morning
[42:12] is this guy would say and
[42:17] what 80 years ago it's the same today
[42:20] for us this morning everyone has
[42:21] different circumstances but how you
[42:24] think of yourself you're either here
[42:25] this morning thinking of yourself as a
[42:27] Son of God or a daughter or a God or
[42:30] you're thinking something contrary to
[42:31] that and only you know that this morning
[42:33] but let me read some scriptures here
[42:35] this morning so um so I'm not up here a
[42:38] whole long time in the Gospel of John
[42:41] I'll read these scriptures they don't
[42:43] change
[42:44] it's forever it's settled in the
[42:46] beginning was the word and the Word was
[42:47] with God and the Word was God the same
[42:50] was in the beginning with God all things
[42:52] were made by him and without him was not
[42:55] anything made that was made
[42:58] in him was life and the life was the
[43:00] light of men
[43:01] and when you read this you know many
[43:04] ministers come behind the pulpit and
[43:06] tell you you got to see yourself in it
[43:08] this morning you're reading to yourself
[43:10] back to yourself when you're reading
[43:12] this and the light shineth and darkness
[43:14] and the Darkness of Hopper
[43:16] abandon did not there was a man sent
[43:19] from God whose name was John and we you
[43:21] could think of our day and age we're
[43:23] trusting a messenger for the hour that
[43:25] we live in this morning and the same for
[43:27] a witness to Bear witness of the light
[43:29] that all my men through him might
[43:31] believe he was not the light but he was
[43:34] sent to Bear witness of the light and
[43:36] that True Light which he liedeth every
[43:38] man that cometh into the world
[43:40] it was in the world the world was made
[43:42] by him and the world knew him not he
[43:45] came onto his own in his own received
[43:47] him not
[43:48] and that's where we're at this morning
[43:50] the world is in that same place God has
[43:53] come to the whole world he's given the
[43:55] gospel to the whole world and as you can
[43:58] see one going on around the world to
[44:00] choose not to receive the Gospel they'll
[44:02] receive someone else's gospel like Jesus
[44:05] said but it won't be the Gospel of Jesus
[44:08] Christ and world made by him and the
[44:11] world knew him not he came onto his own
[44:13] his own receipt and not but as many as
[44:16] receding he gave he the power to become
[44:19] the sons of God and that's what that
[44:21] Minister was talking about he's given
[44:23] each of us this morning the power to
[44:26] become the sons of God this morning and
[44:28] that's what we desire to be and he goes
[44:31] on to say I lost my place here I don't
[44:33] want to
[44:34] I was a zombie but he received now but
[44:37] as many as he received him he gave his
[44:39] power to become the sons of God even to
[44:42] them but believe
[44:43] which were born not of blood nor a will
[44:45] but of
[44:47] the will of the flesh nor the will of
[44:50] man but of God and the Word was made
[44:52] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[44:55] his glory the glory of the only begotten
[44:57] of the father full of grace and truth
[44:59] and ought to stop there this morning
[45:01] because I'll just keep going but the
[45:03] first most important thing I thought of
[45:05] this morning coming up here
[45:08] if
[45:10] if I had something else I wanted to read
[45:12] and I'm running out of time
[45:15] Hebrews 13 and 8 do we really believe it
[45:18] Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today
[45:20] and forever if we do then there's
[45:22] nothing that stands between you and your
[45:23] savior this morning that you deserve
[45:26] it's a good gift that you desire of the
[45:28] Lord he's more than able to bring it
[45:30] about in your hearts in your lives this
[45:32] morning brother David
[45:39] him and let's stay in this morning if we
[45:41] could and
[45:43] hey man appreciate that this morning and
[45:46] we serve an awesome God this morning
[45:49] don't we
[45:50] man
[45:57] amen I sing that little course if we
[45:59] could this morning more than ever before
[46:01] I Lord I need you this morning
[46:10] and more than ever
[46:14] before
[46:16] Lord I love you yes Lord
[46:21] more than ever before
[46:25] [Music]
[46:27] Lord I need you
[46:32] more than ever before
[46:36] I want to tell you
[46:39] [Music]

[46:48] before once again this morning
[46:52] oh more than ever before
[46:58] Lord I love you

[49:58] this morning and I said Lord I pray that
[50:01] the song service to be a blessing to
[50:03] your children as it was to me this
[50:05] morning and I was just sitting there in
[50:08] my office and praying and the songs come
[50:11] and this little song came on my heart
[50:13] Born Again free from sin I'm happy night
[50:16] and day and after I got done printing
[50:18] all my songs out and a little thing
[50:20] popped up on my computer
[50:23] and it has the temperature and the top
[50:26] stories and I usually don't
[50:28] even look at it especially on Sunday
[50:30] morning when I'm in there getting songs
[50:32] and so I just I've seen the sign says
[50:35] NASA says the universe is weird or
[50:38] something like that I thought huh so I
[50:40] clicked on it so I'm going to read what
[50:42] they got to say and they begin to talk
[50:44] about all the things with the universe
[50:46] and everything that was going on and as
[50:48] I begin to read it I begin to get happy
[50:52] and I said because part of it was they
[50:55] didn't know where they were going they
[50:57] didn't know who they were and they
[50:59] didn't know where they came from
[51:00] but guess what everyone you know where
[51:04] you're going
[51:06] where you came from and who's
[51:08] responsible for everything that's going
[51:09] on in your heart of life this morning I
[51:11] said Thank You Lord they don't know

[1:15:31] our heart Lord Jesus and that which
[1:15:33] which you feel that you've laid upon our
[1:15:34] heart to minister this morning we ask
[1:15:36] God that you would just come speak to

[1:15:40] you want to speak to him father we
[1:15:43] invite you to come and let your

[1:15:46] presence be felt here and just come and
[1:15:48] do whatever you see fit to do this
[1:15:50] morning we love you and we ask God that
[1:15:52] as we open the Bible you would give us
[1:15:54] the inspiration and the interpretation
[1:15:56] and the word that you want us to speak
[1:15:58] now in the name of Jesus Christ we ask
[1:16:00] it amen and amen
[1:16:03] turn your Bibles amen I was in my uh
[1:16:06] office yesterday in front of my uh
[1:16:11] my computer where I study at and so
[1:16:14] forth and it just bowled my head and and
[1:16:16] just began to pray see what the Lord
[1:16:18] would have and amen it wasn't uh but
[1:16:21] just a minute this is what come to my
[1:16:22] mind and stuck and so we just take it as
[1:16:25] from the Lord amen so it trust that
[1:16:27] it'll be a blessing to you we'll turn
[1:16:29] first to Luke 11 Luke 11 chapter
[1:16:33] Luke 11.
[1:16:41] and it has to do with the Lord's Prayer
[1:16:44] amen last week we talked about the
[1:16:46] Lord's Prayer I believe it's found in
[1:16:48] Saint John 17 where he prayed for you
[1:16:51] and me amen for Unity amen that we would
[1:16:55] be one as they are one today we want to
[1:16:57] talk about the other part of the Lord's
[1:16:58] Prayer where he taught them to pray amen
[1:17:02] amen so
[1:17:04] um I don't believe it said it in Matthew
[1:17:05] so I went to Luke to pick out the first
[1:17:07] verse amen and I'll just pick out the
[1:17:10] first first verse and then we'll go to
[1:17:12] Matthew because they didn't finish the
[1:17:15] Lord's Prayer in this one so we're going
[1:17:17] to go back to the full prayer to the
[1:17:19] full Lord's Prayer in Matthew 11 1 it
[1:17:22] says and it came to pass that as he was
[1:17:25] praying in a certain place when he
[1:17:28] ceased one of his side
[1:17:30] said unto him Lord teach us to pray as
[1:17:34] John also taught his disciples now let's
[1:17:38] go to Matthew if you will back to
[1:17:39] Matthew
[1:17:48] and we'll read The Lord's Prayer and
[1:17:50] perhaps we'll come back and pick up a
[1:17:51] little thought on the introduction to it
[1:17:55] but let's begin with verse 7.
[1:18:00] chapter 6 verse 7 of Matthew
[1:18:10] actually let's go to verse five we'll
[1:18:13] just pick it right all up
[1:18:15] and when thou prayest
[1:18:18] Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are
[1:18:20] for they love to pray standing in the
[1:18:23] synagogue
[1:18:25] and in the corners of the streets that
[1:18:28] they may be seeing of men
[1:18:30] verily I say unto you they have their
[1:18:32] reward
[1:18:33] but thou when thou prayest enter into
[1:18:35] thy closet and when thou has shut thy
[1:18:38] door pray to thy father which is in
[1:18:41] secret and thy father which see is in
[1:18:43] secret shall reward thee openly
[1:18:46] but when he but when you pray use not
[1:18:49] vain reputations as the Heathen do
[1:18:51] do
[1:18:53] for they think that in for they shall be
[1:18:55] heard for their much speaking
[1:18:58] but be not ye therefore like unto them
[1:19:01] for your father knoweth what things you
[1:19:03] have need of before ye ask them ask him
[1:19:08] after this manner therefore pray ye Our
[1:19:11] Father which art in Heaven halloweth be
[1:19:13] thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:19:15] done on Earth as it is in heaven give us
[1:19:17] this day our day our daily bread and
[1:19:20] forgive us of our debts for we as we
[1:19:22] we forgive our debtors lead us not into
[1:19:25] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[1:19:27] thine is the kingdom the power and the
[1:19:30] glory forever amen for if ye forgive men
[1:19:33] their trespasses your heavenly father
[1:19:35] will also forgive you but if but if you
[1:19:38] forgive not men their trespasses neither
[1:19:39] will your father forgive your trespasses
[1:19:42] may God add His blessings to the reading
[1:19:44] of the word you can be seated this
[1:19:46] morning
[1:19:47] amen so we want to talk a little bit
[1:19:49] about prayer amen I titled this teach us
[1:19:51] to pray
[1:19:53] teach us to pray
[1:19:55] amen
[1:19:58] amen so uh I'll ask one question amen
[1:20:02] and I'm sure you all know the question
[1:20:03] is that is what is the only thing that
[1:20:06] you can't do too much
[1:20:09] pray that's one thing you can't do too
[1:20:11] much
[1:20:12] amen we want to talk about the value of
[1:20:14] prayer we want to go through what Jesus
[1:20:16] said amen in the Lord's Prayer and just
[1:20:19] look at what he said and the meaning of
[1:20:20] it and so forth what we can pull out of
[1:20:22] it and I want to talk to you with the
[1:20:23] help of the Lord by with another man's
[1:20:26] prayer now how many knows that I believe
[1:20:28] it's probably God I didn't go to pulling
[1:20:30] it up and thinking so forth but I
[1:20:31] believe he said something about people
[1:20:33] have tried to add to the Lord's Prayer
[1:20:35] and so forth but it's never worked out
[1:20:37] right
[1:20:39] amen and uh you know coming from the
[1:20:43] Lord Jesus Christ we know that if you
[1:20:45] pray to prayer it's going to be perfect
[1:20:47] right it don't need any adding to or
[1:20:49] taking away amen it's going to be
[1:20:51] perfect so what he said is something
[1:20:53] that we could pull a lot of Amen so I
[1:20:56] say this morning I'd like to go over the
[1:20:59] two wisest men in the world's prayer
[1:21:03] the prayer of two of the wisest men in
[1:21:06] the world
[1:21:07] we know that Jesus was the wisest
[1:21:10] isn't that right and how who knows who
[1:21:13] the other one was
[1:21:15] Solomon right
[1:21:17] but it's declared that he was the wisest
[1:21:19] man amen and so we want to look at his
[1:21:21] prayer with the help of the Lord amen
[1:21:26] um first of all let's let's before we go
[1:21:29] now when I go perhaps uh and pick up
[1:21:32] before I go into the the talking about
[1:21:34] the Lord's actual prayer and the things
[1:21:36] that it says and go through that because
[1:21:38] if you went really through that and took
[1:21:39] your time it would take a very very long
[1:21:41] time but I want to pick up some of the
[1:21:43] things that Solomon prayed and bring it
[1:21:45] over into uh uh Jesus's prayer and kind
[1:21:49] of time together a little bit but I
[1:21:51] would first of all talk about what he
[1:21:52] says what Jesus said here the Disciples
[1:21:55] of course wanting to pray and they said
[1:21:57] that John the Baptist taught his
[1:21:59] disciples to pray this morning we want
[1:22:02] to learn how to pray more now I think
[1:22:04] most of us probably know how to pray
[1:22:06] amen
[1:22:08] we probably know how to do that but you
[1:22:10] know the Bible exhorts us that we ought
[1:22:12] to you know the other thing the question
[1:22:14] I want to ask is what do we do when we
[1:22:16] get one again if you really want to get
[1:22:18] closer to God what is this one thing
[1:22:19] that you got to do according to prophet
[1:22:20] of God
[1:22:22] pray more right pray more and read your
[1:22:26] Bible more that's what he said was the
[1:22:27] secret to be getting closer to God and I
[1:22:30] believe it was Paul that said in second
[1:22:32] Thessalonians back here one place he
[1:22:35] said in the four five and verse 17 Paul
[1:22:39] said pray without ceasing
[1:22:44] do that amen so basically from what I
[1:22:48] understand you know we should always be
[1:22:51] in prayer
[1:22:52] you know you might not be in down on be
[1:22:55] able to be down on your knees but how
[1:22:56] many know you can pray you can
[1:22:57] constantly just be talking to the Lord
[1:22:59] because that's really if you want to see
[1:23:01] somebody that's different than most
[1:23:04] people and if you want to see a strong
[1:23:05] Christian what is that person going to
[1:23:07] do
[1:23:09] they're going to be a prayer Warrior
[1:23:11] amen amen why why would he be why would
[1:23:15] that make him so strong and better
[1:23:17] because he's always talking to God
[1:23:20] it has to do with fellowshipping isn't
[1:23:23] that right God wants Fellowship
[1:23:25] amen and we know that Jesus himself
[1:23:27] Jesus himself prayed a lot didn't he
[1:23:30] amen all right let me go through this
[1:23:32] and I have a lot of comments that I want
[1:23:34] to make but
[1:23:35] first of all verse 5 says that when you
[1:23:38] pray don't be like the Hypocrites but
[1:23:41] because they love to pray standing in
[1:23:43] the synagogues and in the street corners
[1:23:46] that they may be seen of men so never
[1:23:49] pray so that you're because you know
[1:23:52] you're being hurt
[1:23:53] and when you pray it doesn't matter you
[1:23:56] know when you pray you know in a
[1:23:58] congregational women's pray like you you
[1:24:00] know just like the woman remember
[1:24:01] brother man I'm talking about that black
[1:24:03] woman he come an Aunt Jemima that had
[1:24:05] her son you know she said he went down
[1:24:07] there and he asked her to pray first
[1:24:09] and she wasn't there to impress him
[1:24:12] no but when she prayed but the man says
[1:24:15] you could tell that she had talked to
[1:24:17] the Lord before
[1:24:20] amen then people say that about you when
[1:24:23] you pray
[1:24:25] good question right when you're baking
[1:24:27] people say boy he knows how to pray
[1:24:30] because I wonder sometimes right
[1:24:32] sometimes I ask myself you know do you
[1:24:34] really know how to pray
[1:24:35] you know sometimes we act like Lord
[1:24:37] Jesus I ask you to bless this food now
[1:24:39] and Sanctified through my body Jesus
[1:24:41] name amen
[1:24:43] you said any way to talk to God
[1:24:45] you know or just just in you can pray
[1:24:48] wrong a lot of different ways when you
[1:24:50] pray you want to pray sincerely right
[1:24:52] like you're talking to God not like some
[1:24:54] servant or just some myth or something
[1:24:56] you're talking to the Lord
[1:24:58] amen Lord Jesus common and and bless his
[1:25:02] food thank you Lord thank you for this
[1:25:04] food
[1:25:05] thank you and blessed Lord Jesus help us
[1:25:07] to use the strength to serve you in a
[1:25:10] greater way or just however you pray
[1:25:12] but don't do it to be heard pray like
[1:25:15] you do in your closet amen
[1:25:18] and he says you know because it's not
[1:25:20] praying is some not something that you
[1:25:22] do to be heard because listen when he
[1:25:25] says verily I say unto you they have
[1:25:28] their reward
[1:25:29] but when thou prayest enter into thy
[1:25:32] closet when thou has shut thy door pray
[1:25:35] to thy father which is in secret
[1:25:40] amen
[1:25:42] that's where it's all at isn't it
[1:25:44] it's all about what you are
[1:25:47] into secret places in your closet when
[1:25:50] you're by yourself when you're all alone
[1:25:52] amen and you say Lord here I am I and
[1:25:55] you go into a closet you go wherever you
[1:25:57] go
[1:25:59] and that father would seeth in secret
[1:26:01] shall reward thee openly and when ye
[1:26:05] pray use not vain repetitions that they
[1:26:08] even do for they think they shall be
[1:26:10] heard in their much speaking amen it's
[1:26:13] never about how much you say or how loud
[1:26:16] you say it or whatever it's about amen
[1:26:18] whether you're sincere in your prayer
[1:26:22] folks I'm convinced
[1:26:24] me more than ever
[1:26:27] more than ever because this has to do
[1:26:29] with being in tune with God let me
[1:26:32] believe that
[1:26:33] being in tune with for God I wrote down
[1:26:36] here that
[1:26:38] um
[1:26:39] that even in the Lord's Prayer
[1:26:43] not in the Lord's Prayer
[1:26:46] but uh Jesus he's Jesus made the
[1:26:49] statement he says you know not the day
[1:26:51] nor the hour therefore he said watch and
[1:26:56] pray first it said take heed
[1:27:00] take heat amen that you watch and pray
[1:27:03] in other words mix
[1:27:05] sure let you watch and that you pray
[1:27:08] it's I believe is one of the ingredients
[1:27:10] for being ready for their action we all
[1:27:12] want to be ready for the rapture for
[1:27:14] when he comes because we don't know what
[1:27:16] the day is but two things you're going
[1:27:17] to have to do if you're going to be
[1:27:19] caught
[1:27:20] watching not unaware but caught watching
[1:27:23] caught weighty and that is because
[1:27:25] you're going to be in prayer talking to
[1:27:27] God Amen communicating and
[1:27:30] fellowshipping with him amen
[1:27:33] all right
[1:27:37] so that's right so he says uh in much
[1:27:40] speaking but be not be therefore like
[1:27:44] unto them for your father knoweth what
[1:27:46] things you have need of even before you
[1:27:50] ask him
[1:27:52] oh my notice one other thing
[1:27:56] um
[1:27:57] let me see I thought I had this yeah
[1:27:59] right here is the scripture that I was
[1:28:01] looking for I was reading on the sixth
[1:28:03] chapter in the third second verse
[1:28:06] he was talking about alms and so forth
[1:28:08] about talking about they have their
[1:28:10] reward in other words when you do that
[1:28:12] and people think oh isn't he holy isn't
[1:28:15] he isn't he righteous
[1:28:17] it yeah according to scripture that's
[1:28:19] all you're getting
[1:28:21] that's it that's your reward
[1:28:24] and I get that from verse two verse 2
[1:28:26] says when thou does thine alms do not
[1:28:29] sound to trumpet before thee as the
[1:28:30] Hypocrites doing the synagogue and in
[1:28:32] the streets that they may be have Glory
[1:28:35] of men verily I say unto you they have
[1:28:39] their reward amen
[1:28:41] my but what I do is sit do it don't let
[1:28:44] you left hand know what your right hand
[1:28:47] doeth amen
[1:28:50] and also not uh actually
[1:28:54] the first first verse was really what I
[1:28:57] was looking for take heed that you do
[1:28:59] not do arms before meant to be seen of
[1:29:00] men otherwise you have this is the word
[1:29:04] I was looking for and no
[1:29:07] no reward
[1:29:09] of your father which is in heaven
[1:29:13] you just you just cancel out
[1:29:17] you just cancel out your your reward if
[1:29:20] you do it because you're doing it for so
[1:29:21] it's hypocritical
[1:29:23] are you with me this morning
[1:29:25] amen do none of us want to do that none
[1:29:28] of us wants to be a hypocrite we don't
[1:29:29] want dude to be seeing the men and we
[1:29:31] don't even do it before reward do we no
[1:29:34] you do it because it's the right thing
[1:29:36] to do
[1:29:37] amen I believe that a man one place he
[1:29:40] gave so much money to this Widow and so
[1:29:42] much of that this out of the other and
[1:29:43] and and uh and uh IRS ask him about what
[1:29:47] does your wife know that you do this and
[1:29:48] I say I don't tell my wife
[1:29:52] you don't
[1:29:54] the conversations he's at the Bible says
[1:29:56] don't you left let your left hand know
[1:29:58] what your right hand does whatever you
[1:30:00] do you do it to the Lord
[1:30:02] is that okay take it up with him if you
[1:30:04] don't like that amen
[1:30:06] praise the Lord so remember it has to be
[1:30:09] in secret Glory all right I'm gonna try
[1:30:12] to pick this up the Lord's uh prayer
[1:30:14] again but let's go to Solomon let's if
[1:30:15] you would
[1:30:17] second chronicles let's go to Solomon's
[1:30:19] Prayer something we're all familiar with
[1:30:21] we know that Solomon built something
[1:30:24] that David wasn't allowed to build and
[1:30:26] that was the temple of God isn't that
[1:30:28] right David had it in his heart to build
[1:30:30] it and I read here where it says that
[1:30:32] you know that the Lord said that David
[1:30:34] had it right he had the right desire in
[1:30:37] his heart when he desired to do it
[1:30:39] that's what God said about him but he
[1:30:41] said he would refused him to do it he
[1:30:43] said this song Solomon is going to be
[1:30:45] the one that does it and after he build
[1:30:46] it and so forth and and dedicated and
[1:30:50] sang the songs and so forth then in
[1:30:52] Solomon's Solomon in second chronicles
[1:30:55] the sixth chapter we want to begin with
[1:30:57] verse 12. read and then skip a little
[1:30:59] because there's a lot of reading
[1:31:03] but he had everything been placed and
[1:31:05] and
[1:31:06] everything done
[1:31:09] and then it says in verse 12 and he
[1:31:11] stood before the altar of the Lord in
[1:31:13] the presence of all the congregation of
[1:31:15] Israel and spread forth his hands for
[1:31:18] Solomon had made he Brazen scaffold a
[1:31:21] five cubits long and five cubits Broad
[1:31:23] and five cubits high and had said it in
[1:31:26] the midst of the court and upon it I'm
[1:31:28] gonna move this down and upon it it
[1:31:31] stood and kneeled down upon his knees
[1:31:33] before all the congregation of Israel
[1:31:36] and spent forth his hands Towers heaven
[1:31:39] now notice he made his special place
[1:31:41] just to have this prayer and said oh
[1:31:43] Lord God of Israel there is no God like
[1:31:45] unto thee in Heaven Nor in Earth which
[1:31:48] keeps covenants and show us Mercy unto
[1:31:50] thy servants that walk before thee with
[1:31:53] all of their hearts now let's go down a
[1:31:57] little bit further into his prayer Verse
[1:32:00] 18 but will God in every deed dwell with
[1:32:03] men on Earth behold Heaven and Earth
[1:32:06] heavens and had the heavens of Heavens
[1:32:09] cannot contain thee my

[1:32:14] we
[1:32:15] heavens
[1:32:16] and there's the heavens of Heavens now
[1:32:19] how many knows brother Brandon went to
[1:32:20] the sixth Dimension and sixth Dimension
[1:32:22] and he says that's where all the saints
[1:32:24] were all the children all the people of
[1:32:26] converts that it really went on before
[1:32:28] that he had led to the Lord and so forth
[1:32:30] he's seen all of them and it was just
[1:32:31] awesome he said man there's no words to
[1:32:33] describe it so beautiful and he wanted
[1:32:35] to see the Lord and the angel said what
[1:32:37] he says he's not here he's still a
[1:32:39] little higher
[1:32:41] he says there's another dimension even
[1:32:42] high he's even higher than this
[1:32:45] and mommy knows you'll come from the
[1:32:46] heavens of Heavens one of these days to
[1:32:48] pick you up and to pick me up
[1:32:51] take us home to be with him
[1:32:53] let me tell you something you want to
[1:32:55] have a real relationship with him amen

[1:33:01] can't contain him how much less this
[1:33:03] house which I have built I love
[1:33:06] Solomon's Vision he realized that though
[1:33:08] he may come his atmosphere may be here
[1:33:11] there's nothing contained nothing big
[1:33:12] enough for God
[1:33:14] amen
[1:33:15] have respect therefore to the prayer of
[1:33:17] thy servant and to his supplication O

[1:33:22] the prayer which thy servant prayeth if
[1:33:25] are thee amen that thine eyes may be

[1:33:33] upon the place where all thou has said
[1:33:36] that thou

[1:33:44] a prophet Mighty Prophet come in our
[1:33:46] generation and preach to us God's chosen
[1:33:51] place of worship and he used the
[1:33:54] illustration of wherever God puts his
[1:33:56] name that's where he'll meet you
[1:33:58] and if he don't have his name there
[1:34:00] guess what he won't meet you there I
[1:34:02] mean that's why so many churches are
[1:34:04] Godless God ain't there he didn't
[1:34:06] sanction it he didn't put his name there
[1:34:08] just whatever he puts the name that's
[1:34:10] where he'll meet you
[1:34:12] hey Matt so we're glad this morning
[1:34:15] to know where that where that is amen
[1:34:19] all right
[1:34:21] that that would and upon the place where
[1:34:23] Allah has said that that one is put thy
[1:34:26] name there to York and unto the prayer
[1:34:29] which thy servant prayeth Powers this
[1:34:32] place hearken therefore unto the
[1:34:34] supplications of thy servant and of thy
[1:34:37] People Israel which have uh which that
[1:34:40] which they shall make cowards this place
[1:34:43] here thou from thy Dwelling Place even
[1:34:46] from Heaven praise God now notice in the
[1:34:49] Lord's Prayer tying it together a little
[1:34:51] bit remember one of the first things
[1:34:52] that Our Father which art in heaven
[1:34:56] right I mean that's where he is he's in
[1:34:59] the heavens of heavens and when he hears
[1:35:02] you that's where I hear you at he hears
[1:35:04] you from the heavens of Heaven

[1:35:18] heaven and when thou hear us forgive
[1:35:21] whoa amen wouldn't it say forgive didn't
[1:35:25] the Lord say in his prayer forgive us
[1:35:26] forgive us our trespasses
[1:35:29] even as we forgive those who trespass
[1:35:31] against us right another one first one
[1:35:34] of the first things he asks is for
[1:35:36] forgiveness
[1:35:37] amen because that's something we all
[1:35:39] need
[1:35:41] and we need a lot of it
[1:35:43] amen now it says if a man and this might
[1:35:47] take a little while but that's okay if a
[1:35:49] man sin against his neighbor and an oath
[1:35:53] be laid upon him to make him swear and
[1:35:55] the oath come before thine altered in
[1:35:58] his house then hear thou from heaven and
[1:36:00] do and judge thy servant by requiring
[1:36:02] the wicked by recompensing his own way
[1:36:05] upon his own head and by justifying the
[1:36:07] righteous by giving him according to his
[1:36:09] righteousness and if that people is also
[1:36:11] put a worst put to the worst yeah let me
[1:36:16] read this right and if that people
[1:36:18] Israel be put to the worst before the
[1:36:20] enemy because they have sinned against
[1:36:23] they
[1:36:25] and shall return and confess thy name

[1:37:58] you're willing to turn from your Wicked
[1:37:59] Ways even if you're if you're willing to
[1:38:02] give your heart to God again he's more
[1:38:04] than willing to forgive it goes all the
[1:38:06] way back to the children of Israel with
[1:38:08] Solomon's Prayer one of the biggest
[1:38:10] things he prayed for is every kind of a
[1:38:12] trouble that they would get into he
[1:38:14] asked for pardon
[1:38:17] amen
[1:38:19] when thou just afflict them and then
[1:38:21] shall I hear from heaven for thies and
[1:38:23] forgive the sin of thy servant and of
[1:38:26] thy People Israel one thou has taught
[1:38:29] them the good way wherein they should
[1:38:32] walk amen and sent rain upon thy land
[1:38:35] and thou has given unto thy people for
[1:38:37] inheritance and there if there be death
[1:38:41] in the land if there be pestilence if
[1:38:44] there'd be blasting or mildew or locusts
[1:38:46] or caterpillar amen if their enemies
[1:38:49] besiege them in the cities of their land
[1:38:52] whatsoever soar or whatsoever sickness
[1:38:55] there may
[1:38:57] then what prayer or what supplications
[1:39:00] shall be made of any man
[1:39:03] my that's covering a lot of stuff ain't
[1:39:05] it
[1:39:06] or of all thy People Israel when
[1:39:09] everyone shall know his own sorrow and
[1:39:12] his own grief amen I mean you know what
[1:39:15] you do you know what you did to grieve
[1:39:17] the Holy Ghost away
[1:39:20] but when you are willing to repent of
[1:39:22] that
[1:39:24] then Solomon says go ahead and God be
[1:39:27] merciful and forget
[1:39:31] praise be to God
[1:39:33] amen he asked us 490 times a day how
[1:39:37] willing do you think God's to forgive us
[1:39:39] he's more than willing to realize
[1:39:42] now notice
[1:39:43] his own grief and shall spread forth his
[1:39:46] hand into this house then here Powers
[1:39:49] this
[1:39:50] oh now notice I believe even brother
[1:39:53] Brandon talked about different ones that
[1:39:55] men get in trouble uh and they would
[1:39:57] look towards his holy Temple and pray
[1:39:59] they'd have to turn talk that Holy Bible
[1:40:01] whichever direction it was and believe
[1:40:03] and pray God would hear
[1:40:08] amen
[1:40:10] now I may notice we have a place like
[1:40:11] that that we can look to
[1:40:13] see prayer has has to do with turning
[1:40:16] your eyes
[1:40:18] towards Jesus turn your eyes on Jesus
[1:40:20] begin to look to him
[1:40:23] amen
[1:40:25] amen
[1:40:28] then hear thou from Heaven thy dwelling
[1:40:31] place and forgive and Render unto every
[1:40:33] man according to all that he is all of
[1:40:35] his ways whose heart thou knowest for
[1:40:38] thou only know us the hearts of the
[1:40:40] Children of Men
[1:40:42] that day May fear thee to walk in thy
[1:40:44] ways as long as they live in the land
[1:40:46] which God gave his son to our fathers
[1:40:49] moreover concerning the stranger think
[1:40:52] about this not even his people but if a
[1:40:54] stranger does it
[1:40:56] all right which is not of thy People
[1:40:59] Israel but it's come from a far country
[1:41:01] to thy great names for thy great
[1:41:03] namesake and thy Mighty hand and thy
[1:41:06] stretch out arm if they come and pray in
[1:41:09] this house amen
[1:41:12] now from what I understand I may know
[1:41:14] that Israel was very strong about not
[1:41:16] having any heathens coming into the
[1:41:18] temple
[1:41:18] huh
[1:41:20] according to this even if they come and
[1:41:22] they pray amen
[1:41:25] if they
[1:41:26] come and pray in this house then shalt
[1:41:29] thou hear from the heavens even from thy
[1:41:31] dwelling place and do according to all
[1:41:34] the stranger calleth on the boat
[1:41:37] amen
[1:41:38] red be to God Jesus said whatsoever
[1:41:43] things ye desire
[1:41:45] ask and you shall receive
[1:41:49] I mean he's glad for that
[1:41:52] praise the Lord
[1:41:54] my
[1:41:56] mind all right
[1:42:01] uh dwelling place to according to
[1:42:03] strange equality to do and fear thee as
[1:42:07] thou thus the People Israel and may know
[1:42:10] that this house is which I
[1:42:12] have built is called by thy name and If
[1:42:16] thy people go out to war against their
[1:42:18] enemies by the way that thou has sent
[1:42:20] them and they pray unto thee Towers this
[1:42:23] city which thou has chosen and the house
[1:42:26] which I have built for thy name and hear
[1:42:28] thou from the heavens
[1:42:31] amen their prayer and their supplication
[1:42:35] and maintain their cause
[1:42:39] my
[1:42:40] praise the Lord
[1:42:42] can you read something more there
[1:42:44] whenever you ask God to help defeat your
[1:42:46] enemies somebody believes he's going to
[1:42:48] be there
[1:42:50] to answer your prayer but let me ask you
[1:42:53] what does it take it takes Pride
[1:42:57] better man says you know sometimes God
[1:42:59] can announce death on a person and their
[1:43:02] prayer could change the thing do you
[1:43:05] believe that it did for Hezekiah didn't
[1:43:08] it when God told the prophet go tell him
[1:43:09] he's going to die and did not come off
[1:43:11] of his head he turned his face to the
[1:43:14] wall and wept bitterly and God spared
[1:43:16] him his life another 15 years after
[1:43:19] death had been pronounced by God
[1:43:23] he said prayer is the most powerful
[1:43:25] weapon that was ever put in the hands of
[1:43:28] man kind the prayer of faith
[1:43:31] amen I'm at least prayer
[1:43:35] is one of the most powerful weapons that
[1:43:38] God has in his Arsenal for you and me
[1:43:42] praise be to God
[1:43:46] it's the most powerful why
[1:43:48] because when you go down your knees when
[1:43:51] you pray
[1:43:52] what are you doing
[1:43:53] you're tapping into a supernatural power
[1:43:58] something Way Beyond what you're you can
[1:44:01] do what your own ability can do
[1:44:04] amen when you tap into that power just
[1:44:07] comes to mind now but didn't brother bam
[1:44:10] say that when the weakest Christian gets
[1:44:13] where on his knees when he gets here
[1:44:17] the devil's tremble it scares the devil
[1:44:20] to death why because he knows God will
[1:44:22] honor their prayers it's not him doing
[1:44:24] it it's going to be God that comes in on
[1:44:26] the scene it brings
[1:44:28] calling Jesus on the scene prayer is
[1:44:31] calling Jesus on the scene how many
[1:44:33] beliefs we need to pray more folks
[1:44:38] amen prayer will get you out of real
[1:44:42] hard pinched places
[1:44:47] Daniel knew it isn't that right Daniel
[1:44:49] Prayed he was a prayer Warrior and it
[1:44:52] got him out of the lines and he got the
[1:44:54] three Hebrew children out of the fire
[1:44:56] they were so close to God Amen it'll get
[1:44:58] you out of a pinch prayer will not just
[1:45:00] you know you know because you'll turn to
[1:45:02] one thing or the other
[1:45:05] if you don't pray about things you're
[1:45:08] gonna lose your temper
[1:45:10] you're either gonna get angry about
[1:45:12] things or you're going to go to prayer
[1:45:15] about things we need to go to God In
[1:45:17] Prayer about things and you won't get
[1:45:19] angry about things
[1:45:22] that goes for me that goes for you
[1:45:25] amen and I was studying back there the
[1:45:27] last thought that came to my mind about
[1:45:29] this was what brother man said he says
[1:45:31] sweeten your temper with prayer
[1:45:34] prayer will calm yourself now
[1:45:39] it'll sweeten you
[1:45:41] it'll humble you it'll make you Kinder
[1:45:43] it'll be more
[1:45:45] you'll be
[1:45:46] mark
[1:45:47] consider children better
[1:45:50] you'll do every Everything pattern if
[1:45:53] you pray more
[1:45:57] we need to pray more
[1:46:02] I need to pray more
[1:46:04] you'd have a lot less
[1:46:07] that would get to you no I'm not saying
[1:46:10] you're gonna have less problems but
[1:46:11] you'd have less troubles that get to you
[1:46:13] if you prayed more you don't overcome
[1:46:15] more bro cause you're gonna have
[1:46:17] problems
[1:46:19] the prayer is what does it
[1:46:22] that's oh my this is him I'm just gonna
[1:46:24] preach her but even Jesus was the prime
[1:46:27] example of Prayer
[1:46:30] God himself and flesh and that man man
[1:46:33] it was so hard for him and he had to
[1:46:35] pray in the Garden of Gethsemane because
[1:46:37] he knew there was a real test ahead of
[1:46:39] him he's gonna have to give his life
[1:46:40] he's gonna have to be beaten Bruce and
[1:46:42] breathe after death with everything else
[1:46:45] and he had to have strength he had to
[1:46:47] pull from the spirit on the inside by
[1:46:50] going and he prayed for so long and he
[1:46:53] asked his disciples can you pray with me
[1:46:55] amen pray with me and they fell asleep
[1:46:57] on him he was way big it was hard
[1:46:59] thought they didn't realize what was
[1:47:01] happening they didn't realize what he
[1:47:03] was going through but he didn't strength
[1:47:05] and he wanted to pray with him he said
[1:47:06] well just go on sleep on then
[1:47:09] a lot of times when we going through
[1:47:10] hard times it seems like our friends is
[1:47:12] sleeping
[1:47:15] but keep praying amen is that where you
[1:47:19] get your strength from

[1:47:26] is in your prayer
[1:47:27] which is your fellowship with God and
[1:47:29] reading your word the word that's the
[1:47:31] strength of your Christian law

[1:55:12] right for now I have chosen and
[1:55:14] Sanctified this house and my name that
[1:55:17] my name may be there forever in my eyes
[1:55:19] and my heart shall be there
[1:55:23] perpetual
[1:55:25] Willie
[1:55:26] amen praise be to God he'll always be
[1:55:30] there
[1:55:32] Jesus's prayer was
[1:55:34] after this manner pray ye Our Father
[1:55:36] which art in heaven
[1:55:39] Glory
[1:55:41] now notice the first two words it says
[1:55:43] hour
[1:55:49] our father is talking about a group of
[1:55:52] people when it says hour
[1:55:55] now how many knows
[1:55:57] Our Father which art in heaven
[1:56:01] so we realize our father we all have a
[1:56:04] daddy
[1:56:05] [Applause]
[1:56:06] but God is not everybody's father
[1:56:11] The Sinner and them can't call God his
[1:56:14] father
[1:56:15] even Jesus said to the Pharisees he was
[1:56:18] very very straight
[1:56:20] forward and says you know if God were
[1:56:24] your father you'd believe me he says but
[1:56:27] the devil is your father you are of your
[1:56:29] father the devil
[1:56:32] aren't you glad to have a Heavenly
[1:56:34] Father this morning
[1:56:36] it watches out for you that cares for
[1:56:39] you
[1:56:40] oh my I don't know what kind of father
[1:56:43] every one of us has but we think of our
[1:56:44] Earthly father and all growing up and
[1:56:46] everything all the different things that
[1:56:48] we have asked of our father father can I
[1:56:50] have that father can I have that father
[1:56:52] this father
[1:56:54] but you know we don't have an Earthly
[1:56:55] father that is limited in supplies and
[1:56:58] in needs and in material things and and
[1:57:00] things to give to us
[1:57:02] we have a father that owns everything
[1:57:06] that when you get in the bar he has a
[1:57:09] way to get you out of that mind it's
[1:57:11] nice to have somebody to go to and you
[1:57:14] have need of help
[1:57:16] very few things it's just terrible so
[1:57:18] it's being in the world alone and not
[1:57:20] having anybody to help you out when
[1:57:21] you're down
[1:57:22] even the Bible talks about you know two
[1:57:24] is better to have two people because if
[1:57:26] one thousand minutes the other one will
[1:57:28] lift him up we've got to Heavenly Father
[1:57:30] that knows to follow us here he knows
[1:57:32] the number of your hair he cares
[1:57:34] about you every day
[1:57:36] that's why he said in a large day in the
[1:57:38] prayer there a little bit later on he
[1:57:40] talks about him give us our daily bread
[1:57:41] our supply God supplies us with our
[1:57:44] daily bread his eyes are open to the
[1:57:46] sparrow and he knows he needs seeds to
[1:57:49] spell if he feeds his paradise I got his
[1:57:51] eyes open and then he's got his eyes
[1:57:52] open to you and me and I'm gonna give us
[1:57:54] Faith to know that our heavenly father
[1:57:56] it's going to take care of us
[1:58:02] we have our Our Father
[1:58:05] oh my god I've got a father to tell you
[1:58:08] about let me tell you about my daddy
[1:58:10] my father
[1:58:12] I got to thinking about you know the
[1:58:14] different ones of us have different jobs
[1:58:15] do different things but I got to think
[1:58:17] about brother John I talked about a
[1:58:19] logger and if you got your biggest
[1:58:20] skitter or maybe your biggest machine
[1:58:23] that you've got
[1:58:25] God and you got down into some kind of a
[1:58:27] deep Miry mutt that bulldoze and nothing
[1:58:29] would get it out you say
[1:58:31] how am I gonna get this thing out oh
[1:58:34] this is just terrible uh you get down in
[1:58:37] mind you don't know how you're gonna get
[1:58:39] it out but boy I'll tell you what if you
[1:58:40] own hey man if you
[1:58:42] if you knew you had a daddy you had a
[1:58:45] father that had the biggest crane in the
[1:58:46] world hey man you can sit at the edge of
[1:58:48] the balloons almost and reach over there
[1:58:50] just pick that thing right up and pull
[1:58:52] it right out the way it is with my
[1:58:53] heavenly father no matter how much luck
[1:58:55] we get down and he'll pull you out to
[1:58:57] deep Miry clay up but you set your feet
[1:58:59] on a rock it's me
[1:59:02] [Music]
[1:59:06] my heart was distressed me Jehovah's
[1:59:08] breath found and low in the pit where my
[1:59:11] sins smacked me down oh but praise be to
[1:59:15] God praise mercy and First Grace
[1:59:17] for heavenly father that pulled me out
[1:59:19] of a more life of man no hope no nothing
[1:59:22] I don't know which way to go but he
[1:59:24] picked me up says I'm you're my son son
[1:59:28] I'm in his left have a Heavenly Father
[1:59:31] takes care of you
[1:59:34] that's our father right there
[1:59:36] I found it
[1:59:38] he wanted you to know in his prayer and
[1:59:41] you've got it headed you've got a father
[1:59:43] and it ain't the devil it's a Heavenly
[1:59:45] Father which art in heaven
[1:59:47] right he is in heaven if you want to
[1:59:50] talk to somebody in heaven you better
[1:59:51] get on your knees and talk to that other
[1:59:52] dimension because that's where he's at
[1:59:55] praise be to God I thought about our
[1:59:57] father we charged in heaven
[1:59:59] and he's in the heavens of the heavens
[2:00:02] hello
[2:00:03] but I mean no she's just standing on
[2:00:05] high and he gave gifts unto men not only
[2:00:08] did he give gifts unto man but the Bible
[2:00:10] says that he didn't descended again into
[2:00:12] the hearts of his people so if he's in
[2:00:14] heaven and that he is in you what does
[2:00:17] that mean that you got in you that means
[2:00:19] you got a portion of the heavens of
[2:00:21] Heaven in your heart that's why the
[2:00:24] Bible says we are gathered in Heavenly
[2:00:26] places in Christ Jesus it's not hellish
[2:00:29] places it's Heavenly places
[2:00:34] amen
[2:00:36] how many slapped to be in Heavenly

[2:01:04] Helen I'd have said he was holy
[2:01:07] holy holy is his name his name is Holy
[2:01:09] but this is what it says to pray
[2:01:11] Hallowed be thy name means to ask God
[2:01:13] out to let his name be worshiped exalted

[2:02:32] that is to come he comes in three sons
[2:02:35] name son of man Son of God
[2:02:38] and Son of David

[2:02:43] that son of David he sits on the throne
[2:02:46] he rules and Reigns for a thousand years
[2:02:48] now his kingdom is coming when these

[2:05:37] One Day at a Time Sweet Jesus if we
[2:05:40] could just live more like that huh
[2:05:43] and notice it is the next one is and
[2:05:45] forgive us of our debts
[2:05:49] that's a good one there
[2:05:51] apparently he knew that we was going to
[2:05:53] mess up
[2:05:55] huh he put it in his prayer
[2:05:59] put it in his very perfect prayer said
[2:06:02] the one thing we need to ask for what
[2:06:04] was it brother man told Billy Paul
[2:06:06] always make sure everything's right and
[2:06:07] confess before you go to sleep you don't
[2:06:09] know where whether you're gonna get up
[2:06:11] this next morning or not
[2:06:13] huh
[2:06:15] so make sure that you're clear Jesus
[2:06:18] wants to make sure that your sins are
[2:06:20] forgiven
[2:06:22] and that's of course based on huh
[2:06:26] whether you forgive others they're dead
[2:06:29] don't you trespass against you you know
[2:06:31] what as we forgive our debtors forgive
[2:06:35] us about it
[2:06:40] amen and I think this is the case
[2:06:43] remember the one the one
[2:06:47] one day to hold a guy some money and the
[2:06:49] next guy owed him a million times more
[2:06:51] right
[2:06:52] and and let's just say a bit of John
[2:06:56] there always be money
[2:06:57] uh and brother Danny owes me money John
[2:06:59] owes me a thousand dollars but Daniel
[2:07:00] owes me a hundred thousand huh
[2:07:03] and John comes and says you know I'll
[2:07:06] pay you as soon as I can just be patient
[2:07:08] with me like my man says just be patient
[2:07:10] and I'll pay you you know and and I said
[2:07:12] well John let's just forget it just
[2:07:14] forget it I hate to use you for Brother
[2:07:17] John I'm gonna pick somebody
[2:07:19] but and I forgive him he says oh thank
[2:07:22] you brother Bob thank you for giving me
[2:07:24] for giving me
[2:07:26] now I got this story wrong
[2:07:29] I mean they got the story wrong
[2:07:31] I wanna
[2:07:34] they don't he daddy don't know me
[2:07:36] nothing all right Daniel Sean on the
[2:07:38] towel that's how it is
[2:07:41] our holy spirit always straightens it up
[2:07:43] my you know getting my praise firing I
[2:07:47] need more of the Holy Ghost
[2:07:49] so what is it and then Danny goes to
[2:07:52] Brother John says bear with me I'll get
[2:07:55] you your money you know I'm gonna sell
[2:07:56] some boxes we're gonna pay you back
[2:08:00] you know and John said what are you
[2:08:02] talking about I ain't got patience you
[2:08:04] know how you know now and he calls the
[2:08:07] cop because he owes me money throw him
[2:08:09] in jail
[2:08:10] boy if that's about stupid isn't it
[2:08:11] throw a guy in jail for all your money
[2:08:13] how in the world you can make
[2:08:15] because I'm not you're sure not to get
[2:08:17] your money right
[2:08:18] but anyway yeah that's what he did in
[2:08:20] the Bible he said don't throw him in
[2:08:21] jail and then I find out anybody John I
[2:08:24] understand he's threw everybody in jail
[2:08:26] ah when I forgave you
[2:08:29] huh
[2:08:33] let me ask you something do I still have
[2:08:35] the story wrong
[2:08:37] I still got the story wrong don't I
[2:08:39] because he owed me a lot
[2:08:42] and healed him a little
[2:08:44] all right thank you thank you I might
[2:08:45] get my story straight yeah
[2:08:47] all right all right thank you it's just
[2:08:49] a hand I've been catching that somebody
[2:08:51] knows their Bible but I just caught that
[2:08:53] you know because it didn't quite make
[2:08:55] sense that uh you know I'd forgive him
[2:08:57] for little and then he didn't charge you
[2:08:58] much but he was the other way around all
[2:09:00] right but anyway he told us him in jail
[2:09:02] and I said now look what what in the
[2:09:04] world I forgive you for the hundred
[2:09:05] thousand and you won't forgive him for
[2:09:07] the thousand
[2:09:09] and what did he do he just take that man
[2:09:11] and put him in jail until he paid the
[2:09:13] utmost
[2:09:15] now I said that to say this that is how
[2:09:18] it is when we don't want to forgive
[2:09:20] somebody for trespassing against this
[2:09:22] we're the ones that owe a whole lot more
[2:09:24] than what that guy probably does
[2:09:26] huh
[2:09:27] if we've got that attitude then we
[2:09:29] better than we have a lot I got a lot
[2:09:31] more on it
[2:09:32] hey man how many nose wants to be free
[2:09:34] of debt I want to be dead free forgive
[2:09:37] us of our debts as we forgive our
[2:09:39] matters let's be free of that
[2:09:41] there's no sin against
[2:09:43] it was so much so until Jesus at the end
[2:09:47] of his prayer said
[2:09:49] mentions it again isn't that right for
[2:09:52] if you forgive not men their trespasses
[2:09:54] your heavenly father will also
[2:09:56] not forgive you
[2:10:00] folks how many knows that's why that's
[2:10:01] why that's what causes a lot of problems
[2:10:05] in this world with family and With
[2:10:08] Friends
[2:10:09] is that
[2:10:10] lack of forgiveness holding grudges
[2:10:13] holding bitterness it causes a lot of
[2:10:15] problems
[2:10:17] it's all got to be gone then Jesus put
[2:10:19] it in his prayer
[2:10:21] forgive us of our debts amen Jesus never
[2:10:25] said he wasn't praying he says my father
[2:10:27] forgive me Jesus
[2:10:30] just didn't need to be any forgiven but
[2:10:32] he was telling them how to pray forgive
[2:10:34] us of our debts as we forgive our
[2:10:37] debtors and lead us not into temptation
[2:10:40] but Deliver Us from Evil amen how many
[2:10:43] believe that you know there'd be a lot
[2:10:46] of Temptation out there let me knows
[2:10:48] that a lot of tempting by the devil and
[2:10:50] so forth but he said keep us from
[2:10:52] temptation
[2:10:53] amen don't lead us into it but Deliver
[2:10:56] Us from all evil because Jesus knew
[2:10:58] there's a whole lot of evil in this
[2:11:00] world
[2:11:00] amen and we want to stay clear of evil
[2:11:03] Lord help us
[2:11:05] amen
[2:11:08] Deliver Us from Evil
[2:11:14] for thine
[2:11:15] is the kingdom
[2:11:17] amen praise the Lord in other words he's
[2:11:20] the king
[2:11:21] it's his kingdom
[2:11:22] boy if the church is in this age would
[2:11:24] have realized that it ain't about what
[2:11:26] they think or say it's what God
[2:11:28] vindicates and proves
[2:11:30] huh it's his kingdom he says how you
[2:11:33] know what the prophet God says you know
[2:11:34] let every man's word be a lie and here's
[2:11:36] the truth that's why he says man this is
[2:11:38] the only truth there is
[2:11:40] there's not a thousand different ways
[2:11:42] Jesus is the only way
[2:11:45] it's the only name that God ever has for
[2:11:48] you to meet God anywhere is the name of
[2:11:50] Jesus not father son the Holy Ghost not
[2:11:52] Baptist Baptist or anything else only in
[2:11:54] the name of Jesus Christ it's his
[2:11:56] kingdom for thine is the kingdom
[2:11:59] the power amen oh Hallelujah aren't you
[2:12:04] glad to know that it's not your power
[2:12:07] it's God's power in your life that kept
[2:12:09] you to overcome anything
[2:12:11] it's his power and His glory
[2:12:17] oh my
[2:12:18] we're just worms
[2:12:21] we're just worms okay
[2:12:23] even the Bible calls us worms
[2:12:27] am I a worm I am a worm something of
[2:12:29] them said when those those holy prophets
[2:12:33] really get a picture of what they are
[2:12:34] they say I'm a worm
[2:12:36] compared to God I'm nothing without God
[2:12:38] you're nothing without God man I was
[2:12:41] walking last night on the farm and I
[2:12:42] looked up at that orange sitting sun in
[2:12:44] that beautiful sky and all of creation
[2:12:47] everything that he's made and I thought
[2:12:50] man people absolutely take for granted I
[2:12:53] think they are enjoying God's creation
[2:12:55] and God in his presence so far
[2:12:57] everything he's made they take it
[2:12:59] completely for granted
[2:13:01] can they do that
[2:13:03] they don't even appreciate it but when
[2:13:04] they're in hell
[2:13:05] there's no sun there's no trees there's
[2:13:07] no sunsets there's nothing of God no
[2:13:09] sight of God nowhere

[2:13:15] kingdom and the power and the glory
[2:13:19] amen I say a woman because listen ain't
[2:13:21] none of us deserve any Glory

[2:13:34] glory all the power amen for thine is
[2:13:36] the kingdom and the power and the glory

[2:13:56] praise be to God
[2:14:01] amen
[2:14:04] praise the Lord
[2:14:06] it was just maybe one more the house of
[2:14:09] Cornelius remember he was a one that
[2:14:11] gave alms and he says and he prayed
[2:14:14] and he prayed
[2:14:16] for the right path
[2:14:18] and being a gentile isn't that right the
[2:14:21] angel come down and says I've heard your
[2:14:22] alms and your prayers have come up
[2:14:24] before God your prayers are heard it was
[2:14:27] his prayers that made the difference I
[2:14:29] mean I believe there's so much
[2:14:31] difference Our Lives can be one place
[2:14:33] the Bible says you ask not because you
[2:14:35] believe not you ask him this because you
[2:14:38] do it upon your own lust but be you have
[2:14:41] not because you asked not
[2:14:43] how many believes a lot of times people
[2:14:44] don't have things because they don't ask
[2:14:46] and they don't ask because you don't
[2:14:48] believe
[2:14:49] one more scripture where that says you
[2:14:50] know when thou prayers for something
[2:14:52] believeth that believe that thou will
[2:14:54] receive it and thou shall have it
[2:14:57] he says whatsoever you ask in my name
[2:14:59] James 8 John 14 around 16 he says Jesus
[2:15:02] says I will do it
[2:15:06] I mean please forget to ask ask for a
[2:15:08] closer walk with God ask for a deeper
[2:15:10] walk with God how many needs a deeper
[2:15:12] walk with God a closer walk with God
[2:15:16] God says I will give it to you
[2:15:19] amen I love the testimony brother Brian
[2:15:21] that's just how God does in our lives
[2:15:25] he keeps us from multi-million dollar
[2:15:27] lawsuits he keeps this from he watches
[2:15:29] over he cares about us
[2:15:32] because we stand for him sometimes maybe
[2:15:34] we talk to Sinners maybe they don't take
[2:15:36] it but just be fact that we're standing
[2:15:37] for Christ we're not ashamed of Christ
[2:15:39] and we're not ashamed of the gospel God
[2:15:41] Honors that he watches over his people
[2:15:43] I'm in his plan for God that watches and
[2:15:46] has an open eye to you and I his eyes on
[2:15:48] the sparrow he's always got an open eye
[2:15:50] always watching you day and night
[2:15:53] oh that
[2:15:56] ought to tear us up and put a little
[2:15:57] Zeal in a little zip in our feet say
[2:16:00] thank you Lord Jesus you have a great
[2:16:02] heavenly father and we worship you and
[2:16:04] we magnify you stand with me this
[2:16:07] morning amen and just give him another
[2:16:08] cup off and say thank you Lord Jesus

[2:16:22] that we ought to pray always without
[2:16:24] ceasing amen
[2:16:25] God bless you this morning with our
[2:16:28] heads bowed
[2:16:29] how many will I Repent say I don't pray
[2:16:32] as much as I should and I'm repenting
[2:16:34] right now I'm acknowledging my fault
[2:16:36] that I don't pray like I should I don't
[2:16:38] have fellowship with God like I should I
[2:16:40] need to pray more than what I do God
[2:16:42] bless those hands all over the building
[2:16:44] now Lord you see it Lord and you said if
[2:16:47] we turn from our way and Lord we'd
[2:16:48] written acknowledge our sin Lord Jesus
[2:16:51] and everybody's at a different place
[2:16:52] Lord you know where everybody is Lord
[2:16:54] but they all got their hands raised and
[2:16:56] saying Lord they want to be at a closer
[2:16:58] place with you now I ask God that all of
[2:17:01] our sins
[2:17:02] and all of our failures would go on to
[2:17:04] the blood of Jesus Christ and that we
[2:17:06] would go from this building cleaner and

[2:17:34] to you always fellowshipping with you
[2:17:36] and talking to you Lord that's how it
[2:17:38] should be Lord a constant Fellowship
