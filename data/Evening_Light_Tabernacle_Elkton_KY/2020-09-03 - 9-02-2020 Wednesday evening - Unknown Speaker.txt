========================================

committed fornicator and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached under heaven and god has remembered her iniquities just before just before brother branham reads this in 1965 the god of this evil age he says what is it he said the world's heading to a climax heading to a climax why the spirit of lawlessness moral decay scientific religion has let it let it to each of every hateful and unclean bird and refers this to a absolute that the spirit of loneliness moral decay scientific religion has absolutely led it to this place so revelations 18 this is the climactic time of religion amen this is the climax of religion this is not only the climax of religion but we should say that not just any religion because there's actually two two religions one is the devils and one's gods and that right and so this is this is the climax of of wrong religion moral decay amen now so now brother bam says right after that in the next one he says now what a warning he says that throws the church exactly back to revelations 3 14 again to that leadership age lawlessness religious real religious brother man says real religious but lawlessness amen you know and so he says you know because thou sayest we are rich and have need of nothing no it's not that our naked miserable blind and knows it not perfectly with the scriptures of this age not the scripture for daniel's h or the other age of noah but for this last age amen so we see that this is a climactic age that we're living in we know that it's going there's a climax both for god's the religion god's faith god's people and also satan's religion and we find here that that this babylon is followed now how many knows that at one time uh you know we had we had women still do i guess but all these different religions of methodists and presbyterians and uh confusion right and that's what babylon was was confusion babylon means confusion you know and so but so it talks about balablon haven't fallen so to me it sounds like at one time babylon fallen yet that's exactly what a prophet taught us there was a time where even brother branham amen in his ministry would tell now finds you a good church home to go to there's a lot of them around here is that right amen and he would send people to the denominations he would send them in there and send them in there god was dealing with them god was working with him and so forth but there we all know that there was a great turning point in that right a great turning point where the the denominations actually kicked jesus out amen they cut christ out amen and after that it fell now notice that it actually fell because of disobedience now let me just read something else here the meaning i want you to i want to read you the meaning the meaning of disobedience okay disobedience now over in ephesians i want to read that scripture about the disobedience and the children of disobedience because brother bennett makes reference to this he says now in ephesians 2 and verse 2 where in times past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience all right disobedience now but says children of disobedience this is god of the civil age disobedience means rebellion i looked that up in the dictionary to be sure rebellion rebellion against what the revealed word of god am i right the revealed word of god like cain rebelled against abel's revealed revelation all right vindicated of god that it was he was righteous and cain rebelled against it and slew his brother the pharisees with their own denominational knowledge of what the word of god was selected hand pikmin rebelled against the vindicated word of god made manifest for the day jesus christ and they killed him amen so we see there but he makes a statement that there's only two classes of people spoke up in the new testament that's the children of god and the children of the devil or we could say the children of disobedience amen brother bam goes on to talk about that that there's there's only two classes and there's the children of obedience and then there's the children of disobedience amen or rebellion now i'll tell you what how many knows that when if anybody ever has a parent if you're a parent and if your child ever decides to rebel against you that's one of the worst things that a parent can experience is a rebellious child hey man you try to talk to them you try to talk loud to them you try to be nice to them and they just don't want nothing then they're gonna hear it amen they are not gonna listen to you they rebel against you and that is a real hard place for a parent to be is that right how many know that in the old testament and if a child was too rebellious would not do it they'd actually take them out and stone them because that's what god thinks about rebellion amen now we all know that the first rebellion and the first disobedience and rebellion that ever happened happened where in heaven the first disobedience happened in heaven the first rebellion that happened what happened in heaven and i can't imagine how that god must have felt isn't that right for satan to come up and two-thirds of the angels by the time says a two-third but anyway and so you you know for god to have to deal with and actually cast the devil out all right cast the devil out and and now here in revelations if you'll notice that in the revelation it says that the babylon the great is fallen and has become the habitation of devils amen so how many of those that's any spirit that is a spirit of rebellion or disobedience is the spirit of a devil it's an evil spirit it's a horrible spirit amen and so it's become the habitation of devils the whole of every fowl spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird amen so we see we know that brother babe taught in the lineages and the two lineages he said there's only two classes of speak people spoke of children of god children of the devil we trace that back all the way to genesis and we find out that there was only two kinds of children one of them was the children of abel isn't that right and not the children of abel abel didn't have any children amen but over in genesis it talks about cain now i wanted to read this can i take my time and just read this let's look at these two children for a minute in genesis 4 and verse 16 we'll start with and now cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden now this was after of course he had slew his brother amen and the lord came down and said where is abel thy brother and you know he says i know not am i my brother's keeper he lied right into the face of almighty god that's the audacity of satan's lineage is to lie right in his face that was the same kind of devil that was on the pharisees that looked jesus in the face amen and said don't we speak well that we say that thou art has the devil you know and so forth that dies the devil you know right there right to his face the very god they could raise the dead and so forth the pharisees had a lot of audacity audacious same as the cain had he has a lot of adapts to the let me tell you something the children of cain they have a lot of audacity they're not afraid to speak evil amen if god's people are of god even tread you know where they walk with hot nail shoes people they speak and that's what cain was he right into the [Music] god and said i don't and then of course cain there given the revelation and said look if you get the same revelation if you'll do exactly like what your brother did you'll be accepted but in the face of all of that he still refused he willfully what disobeyed instead of doing what god said to he didn't do what god said do he rebel how many knows that cain was the first rebel he was the first rebel that rebelled against god amen and so we look at that we see that in the lineage of canaan also amen this this this the beginning of it how that uh you know that's where all of this come from brother baby says look at cain you know in him was hatred in him was jealousy amen from jealousy with hatred and from hatred went to murder you know and so but you know i believe that god's children are different they have a different atmosphere about them amen especially when you're born again now you might be by nature children of wrath you might be that way but once you get the holy ghost that nature dies and you get a new nature it's completely different we see that's why i said you know you know whether you kill as many as what hitler did or you kill one you'll still be a murderer you know right and so cain here we see how that he uh how did he had this nature of rebellion and he goes all the way down and we find like rubber bands says the climactic age is what the age in which you are you and i are living in and then i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna save time but it talks about how that came to his wife she conceived and bear enoch and he builded a city and called the name after the name of his son enoch all right so we see that first thing that brother bam says here is that the lineage of cain and what he begin to do he says if you'll notice there come a great civilization through that lineage of cain back there and they begin to come up men begin to multiply they begin to go out and get different educations and so forth and discovery of things if you go down further here uh jubal his he was a maker of the harp and the organ how many of them says he would make instruments cain's lineage is the one that could make instruments amen and boy i'll tell you what you know how many knows the devil one time was right in the presence of god so he knew how to worship the devil knew how to worship and so you look at rock and roll you look at what's out there and you look at the you know there's so many different kinds of rock there's so many different kinds of music and then then the people you have a concert and people will go absolutely wild you know right screaming holland doing all kinds of man they worship they're gone amen and so you know they really worship their god and i'll tell you what i believe we ought to worship our god as much as what they worship theirs that's exactly right because we've got something real something greater something better than what they have but yet he knew that and he does that that's what he does today he provides all of his children amen things like that but if you'll notice here that the lineage of caden and i want to talk about these children of disobedience and these uh these lawless nature of lawless children the children of lawlessness and their nature and what they do and what they lean on okay now notice he says and they went out and got all kinds of educations and so forth and it just comes to mind i didn't bother pulling it up but how many mo how many of the bands says education civilization and culture and and progress progress and all of these things are all of the devils science education all these things are of the devil amen and i i meant to bring that out how that you know it says that the children will be disobedient to parents now you know i i thought about saying this that the reason that our children are disobedient is because the parents taught them to be disobedient how can you say that brother about it because our prophet clearly said we wouldn't have disobedience we wouldn't have juvenile delinquency you had to have parent delinquency before you had juvenile delinquency he said it's parent delinquency because they're just little children and they will obey you if you make them is that right and so they taught them and they taught them not to whip them they taught them not to do this and the count the one two three this out of the other and they taught them disobedience amen and so that that's why they became that way and along with that all that other stuff that is written there was a result of them teaching them not to have to obey they they taught them this was disrespect and they became selfish in all of the things that they have become so now notice another thing it says listen different education science all this and discovery of things inventions now we read that in the fourth chapter of genesis where you know these people they became inventors they invented things they discovered things amen maybe and he says there's another one that was a great worker of wood and how they built and to begin to build and build and build and it was listen brother bound says it was a sign that the end time was near and that because of the building and building like as it was in the days of noah they built it they did this that was one of the signs that he was getting close to the end now notice and that's one thing i want to bring out if you'll notice that the children of kane they love to build cities now how many knows that when you look at those big cities out here i don't know about you but i know sons of god daughters of god live in those cities they're not not they can't live in them but it's it was something that you know for the most part i mean i believe a christian likes to be somewhere under an evergreen tree amen we love the mommy loves to be out in the country i love the country amen and that's what says children is brother bam said they were sheep murderers they lived out there in the country sheep and herod and so forth and it says that whenever seth listen it says and adam knew his wife again and she buried his son and called his name seth for god says he says she has appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew so we see another seed line and to seth verse 26 to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos and then began men to build cities to make pipe organs to be inventors no then men began to call on the name of the lord amen that's why i'll tell you what i believe that a christian doesn't rely they don't lean on science we don't leave on education we don't lean on progress and i don't think we lean on the lord i mean you release the son and daughter god we are leaning in it's on the law we're leaning on the lord not on all these modern things amen praise the lord inventions wood and so forth now notice and they were great workers of metal all right they discovered how they could do it with metal and look what they're doing with metal today they're even making steel or metal houses now how many knows that there's a lot of construction out there with metal studs and all of that everything metal metal metal metal metal amenities goes to show you know that where did that come from amen they cut out all the timber and i noticed and the great discoveries of education and great going on of science and progress of science he says it's a sign of the end time look what science has done in the last few years that's the things that it's done what is it nearing the end time he says it's a sign to all the believers and he says and ministers in the pulpit should be preaching it with all the force that they got showing the people that were passing milestones and all things point to the end amen all right now notice notice these smart educated canaanites out of the lineage of uh cain came these humble boys they married these humble peasant boys of seth and from there become great giants that were renowned we find out that they were great scientists great workers of wood great and smart and educated people they had a great economy huh that about what it is now the devil has a great economy let me tell you something the stock market that every nation on the heavens probably is tied to the stock market almost you know and they if if the stock market would crash it wouldn't just affect us it would affect everybody all over the world and they're trying to control how many of these are that's all in the hands of the devil the devil's controlling all of that amen yes he is and you know uh but anyway so i know it was educated now he said became scientists educated people a great economy and they lived in such a scientific age until they built pyramids that we can't even build today i mean they were smart folk all right he says and they leave great marks that we see in the rock and the sands of time he said that we could not produce or reproduce today because those people leaned upon their knowledge and become scientists and smart men and renowned men but the sons of god that stayed humble stayed away from such as that and relied upon god how many is with me tonight we're not relying on the science and education we're relying on god i'm glad to be led by god amen so he says there's only two classes and i just want to put something in here two classes of people and that's the children of lawlessness and the children of god amen and there's a spirit he says it's called the spirit of lawlessness but he says there's also another spirit let me just let me uh right here here's what i'm looking for but i haven't finished this all right knowledge now men okay so the people today say they're smart they got all this and we do all this so much smarter than we was and we're so much further away from god than we were is that the truth look at the world so much more science but look how far away people found from god see you draw yourself away like that now i notice brother bam says now we find out that she's naked in this age she's lewd she's nude the world seems to be in the most evil age ever ever never in any day do women act like they do except for before the andaluvian destruction amen i wrote down here in my notes you don't have to wonder what people acted like and what they look like and what they did before the destruction isn't that right amen it was the most immoral world and i mean i'll tell you what it's just terrible what the world's gotten to but you know it says if you want to know what it looks like in the days of no all you got to do is go to walmart all you got to do is go out a little bit and you'll see exactly what it was like in the days of noah we don't have to wonder what it was like in days of life right and the immorality homosexuality caused people we hear it and see it every day amen totally immoral amen my no morality left anymore now notice so he says just before destruction jesus referred to it he says we'll get to it after a while says has god lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control i wonder and the true answer to this question to my opinion is that there's two opposing spirits in the world today at work he said now there can't be no more than two just two heads and one of them is the holy spirit at work and the other one is the spirit of the devil amen oh my and in these last days in deception now we're going to base our thoughts right there he says the two spirits one of them is god's holy spirit and the other one is the devil's spirit working in deception i thought about that and i got to thinking about how that each and every one of us is like a car a car right and a car has to have somebody on the steering wheel right somebody that has to turn the ignition somebody has to give it gas somebody has to push the brakes and we are only a vessel how many believes we're only a vessel and we are either driven we're driven by something you've heard people make the statement well i it was something just drove me to do that yeah something's driving you i mean believe tonight even every one of us is driven we are being driven by something something drives you amen praise the lord hallelujah if i wasn't up here praising god and saying thank you lord jesus i'd probably be cursing and drinking a bear huh bye we're going to be driven by something you're going to have some kind of a spirit on you some kind of a spirit is going to drive you so we have to ask ourselves what is driving you is it the holy spirit or is it the antichrist spirit remember the antichrist spirit will make you think you're okay and when you're lukewarm and when you're not what you ought to be the holy spirit will convict you of what you are it'll cause you to want to get closer to god amen so we're driven by something one or the other amen as bad as it is brother adam says there's only two two powers only things two only two things driving us and he says listen there's one of the spirit of god one of the holy spirit the other one working in deception the people of the earth are now making their choice and the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ amen how many is god's doing that he's calling a bride in this evil age that we're living in the most evil of all evil ages since the time of noah right and since the time of light it's never been this evil that's why they said in the days of noah when we read that sunday the thoughts of people's minds are only wicked constantly wicked amen people were wicked brother says it's an evil age and the devil is the god of this evil age evil wicked satan's eden is where we're in but in the middle of all that all right listen the holy spirit is calling a bride out he's doing it by vindicating his word of promise to her for this age showing that it is christ all right now notice whatever part of the spirit the holy spirit the spirit of god as it's growed into the full stature of god hallelujah how many believes the holy spirit has grown the church now into the fools of christ luther he just walked by faith hey i protest the child mark and these feasts is on the 99 thesis so i guess he put tact on the door and stuff protesting the catholic church and he protested he was beginning to walk by faith sanctification through wesley and pentecost was speaking in tongues and so forth but brother brown says the holy spirit has come now and he is up a man so much until people thought he was jesus christ huh yeah people thought brother branham maybe was god i mean he could tell you who you're from where it is then he pronounced healing upon you and everything else in that right and how many times brother bran would have to clarify now i can't heal you i'm just your brother he would always have to clarify clever people still didn't listen you need to get a q-tip right and just clean it and listen i said i wasn't jesus you make me antichrist i'm getting off the field if this that serpent that he saw you know wiggling his tail he tried to kill it but he didn't quite kill it amen that's why he didn't quite kill it because he's still in the land today people trying to make g by the random god but it's so close he's grown into the full stature of god amen because so because you he knew that you and i would need this kind of a ministry that we would need to see and know and be proven that it's real otherwise we'd probably be swamped up too we wonder what to believe we feel in confusion i'm thankful for the message of the hour i'm thankful for what i thank god i say thank you lord jesus for sending a prophet let me tell you if you want one of the greatest signs of all signs that we're at the end time behold i kind of he says uh the day cometh that shall burn as an oven right right but i'll send you elijah before the great and dreadful day of the lord before this happens i'll send you lights that was the greatest sign this world saw amen was that was that god was fixing to destroy and burn this world was by sending my life all right so now notice i was gonna let you out at eight tonight i'm gonna let him out of eight and just surprise him but can i go a little further all right so now the spirit of god as he grows into the full stature of god the age that we're now living in the holy spirit here vindicating the message of the hour the holy spirit is doing this so that the people believe god will be called out of this chaos when you walk into walmart you don't look like everybody else when you go anywhere you don't look like you don't dress like everybody else hey man you're like a star you're like a light in the night they're like wow there goes the sister with the dress and long hair i mean he was homie you going anywhere you see that anymore it's like wow there's still some left oh my praise the lord that's right the holy spirit is doing this the devil's unholy spirit is calling his church by error as usual by perversion of the word of god like he did at the beginning amen see it coming right back to that seed time again from here it is again amen so now notice notice how beautiful the scriptures tied themselves together in every age when the church would not have that word of god to rule over them they accept that they murder barabbas how many knows that how many that's exactly what cain did when he did not accept the revealed word of the hour he became a murderer huh and murdered his brother he was a murderer he picked up a rock probably and mashed his head in out in the field he was a murderer amen so now here again he says you know even um now i was going to read it i'll save time but over there in saint john i believe it is brother uh not brother but jesus christ was talking to the pharisees and there was disputing whether he was of god and all of these out of the other and calling him a devil and he was saying no you can't hear my word my word has no place in you i come from god and do his works if you would be of god you would hear me amen and then finally you talk so much until he said i and my father are one and they took up stones to stone him what is it amen you get an argument with the lineage of the devil and they'll get so mad until they will try to kill you amen that's where it leads to where they'll actually kill you i mean that's what the world that we're living in is people amen that'll take that same way with the pharisees amen with stephen amen they got so mad they got so angry until they actually touched on him didn't they amen you talk about the people that like to grab some rocks and kill people now jesus did condone so many bad people that were rebellious but he never condoned stoning good people but that's what cain does he is a amen somebody likes us kill people and now i notice so now notice so he says they chose they accepted a murderer for rabbits what did this do oh my it exalted satan the god of this evil age amen notice how he says how beautiful the scriptures tie themselves together in every age brother batman's talk bringing it down to our age also it exalted satan the god of his evil age to a place that's always that he's always wanted to be in listen satan has not spoke of the god of any other age but until in this age he is the god of this age worshiped by millions and billions of people and they don't know it that's pretty strong in it that's right now let's just look at that he knows that whenever jesus come along when cain come along they would he would not accept it when jesus come along and tried to tell them the truth they would not accept it they absolutely rebelled against the word of god in that hour they came against it they rejected it and they rebelled against it just like the churches did in our day i mean those day rebelled they accepted something that was going to kill them a barabbas a murderer they accept that the same lie that satan told eve a perverted word that right all right and what did it do it classified them as the spirit and the children of what disobedience it put them into the class of disobedience all right but said it wasn't until this hour this age that actually satan is actually in the place that he wanted to be not six thousand years ago but much fur further back than that when he was up in heaven i want to be like god i want to be like the most high all right and he rebelled against anything he didn't care anything what god said or had to say just like a rebellious child the most horrible nightmare is for they don't care what you say what you think they're gonna do what they're gonna do and that right that's what he was he had an ambition that he had and listen so he he he he's achieving what he wanted and i want to own a i want to give you another signpost another milestone i believe that's happening right here in front of us amen that's showing us where we're at but let me let me read this here let me read this before i do that listen so he says now she is the devil's bride wrapped in his religious sin-loving knowledge for this present evil age to deceive you the whole clique of denomination of seduce seducing spirits by scientific knowledge and a modern civilization claiming that she's building a great world for you to live in how many knows that this whole world and everything about it is geared to make it easier to sin in easier to sin in all right because that's what the devil is he that's what he is his sin she claims that her civilization she has built fine churches colleges schools hospitals libraries temporary health for man without god's word she's done it she's proved that she could do it and the people fell for it yes sir schools denominations culture better dress people better fed people but i'd rather be in the red line and be right with god than to have chicken three times a day and belong to a prostitute like that now he knows that when you go against the word of god you automatically come into the class of a prostitute that's why over in revelations i want to read it again over revelations that she was called it says all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication fornication okay and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth our wack structure delicacies so that we can say that whole church world pentecost baptist everybody that goes against the word of god they actually commit spiritual fornication against almighty god right so now notice she says i'd rather have that now you remember the hour is close at hand when the mark will come and you will be either in or you'll be out and it'll come like a thief in a night and it'll catch you right there and there you are you ain't gonna get out of it then you done took it so he says come out the angel that came down from heaven with a great shining face and cried with the people that shook the earth come out of babylon for she's fallen be that partakers of her plagues her sins my people get out of her get out didn't you just read that in the word while ago the angel's message see coming down notice the holy spirit he's called getting her to come out of there that you've been out partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues so that's what god is doing in a broad right form because how many knows that jesus said you know over revelations he says blessed are they that do my commandments that they might have a right to the tree of life if you love me keep my commandments how many believe that the children of obedience they want to obey every word that is in him every word that's in here at the children of god but the children of the devil they don't want to have any of it and now i'm going to tell you what i wanted to tell you in this i think what's going on in our political system it certainly has a spiritual significance because we realize there's people and there's congress people over there out there now that we thought were just plain dumb we just they would make statements that was completely completely unfathomable isn't that right and we're like wow but those same people are becoming more popular than anything all right there i just read today where where some of those congress people are that are have the craziest idea there's the most popular and look at what we've gotten to now now the churches brother branham oh my we could go on and on the god of this evil age brother brown says the churches man you can wear bikinis you can wear your hair you can do all of these things and you can still belong to him you can still belong to church now right denominational church doesn't support and listen even it's hard to believe that even churches that would call themselves pentecost we're a pentecostal church we believe in pentecost a real new experience and the holy holy absolutely antichrist absolutely have turned god away no more god in it than that brother i'm saying that everyone's dead they've turned god away so never never thinking that remember the devil and his children they are very very religious those folks out there the whole world practically is religious not everybody but it's most people are and brother goes into detail if you want to listen to that tape god of this evil age he talks about how that the devil let her do anything and that's what people want people want to be able to do anything and call themselves christians that is the devil's church that's the devil's people they don't really want to have any rules they don't want to follow any laws isn't that right and now our country and the state that we are oh my and people are falling for our sports people and the whole world's falling for it amen to even thinking about defunding the police isn't that right and you to think that is the dumbest thing that you could ever do you know right but so many people so many people are listen it's not about defunding the plea you know what it means if you defund the police you know how many what is a police officer a police officer is somebody that is a what do you call him now a law enforcement officer right police is law enforcement officers they want to get rid of the law enforcement officers why because they don't want no law they're disobedient they don't obey anything and that right children of disobedience are coming to their climax they're coming to where they want to live in the world where there ain't no laws that's where cain wanted to live god says do this now i'm going to do that huh jesus said to the fast do this you need to do that no we don't want to do none of that huh look at what the prophet god came and said you've been you this is what you need to do and this is the rules of god you know you can't add one word or take one word away and they're right we don't want to do that we're going to reject you know throw you all out we all want to do what we want to do that's what the world that we're living in and to think that that move would be that probably powerful and that popular let me tell you something anybody that supports that partakes of it and that anybody supports it partakes of it becomes part of it and why do you think you have the lawlessness isn't that right and they're letting them peter they're actually letting them uh one news anchor went to the went to do a you know a series and so forth and he went to a big old party these young people were having and they were just getting drunk and just smoke they were just having a party because they're we're in a little bit we're going to go do this a bunch of stuff we're going to lie we're going to do this that or the other i mean they pre-planned these things do you know what used to happen with something like that you'd have law and order we're calling for law and order in a world of lawlessness now notice what brother branham said and that's what i've come to this thought in the beginning was what is it the world's heading to a climax with the spirit of lawlessness so we can see how that we are climaxing the spirit of no law we come into our climax that spirit started with cain and it's right here in front of us and we can scratch our heads and say really don't you realize what kind of world that would be what kind of world will it be i don't know but i don't want to be here when it comes to fruition are you with me tonight lord help us i believe it is another milestone it is telling that hey it's the children of cain the children that were taught to disobey they're truly children of disobedience no respect they don't want the law chicago now then people in those uh those thoughts that they're very careful now because they said that we want you fair the cop comes around we want you to shoot him and record it they've got a word out just shoot him and record it spirit of lawlessness it's on us how many believes it and where did it come from first it started with the churches churches ain't going to follow god's word huh how many knows your mom and dad don't follow the word well the kids ain't going to worship more about where he's about your word won't hold much weight isn't that right and if uh our government and all these other people churches and so forth they don't do it then the children will do it and the devil bread it right into him and bring it right into it because the devil doesn't want no law he wants to do whatever he wants to do that's the devil that's his children this is his eden and we're coming to the climax with the spirit of lawlessness god bless you let's stand tonight because we all know that his law is not a law but even brother brown said it wasn't unless it's enforced amen doesn't mean anything if it isn't enforced how many is glad to be a part of the children of this and not disobedience but obedience we want no part of disobedience we want to say lord here we are help me to believe every word the prophet god said full obedience to every word of god entitles you to the token amen we want to obey everything that jesus said but this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you keep my commandments no he didn't say it just that way but over it says you know we know that we love him if we keep his commandments in first john with our heads bowed how many feels the holy spirit is here he's speaking to us showing us where the world is and he's asking you where are you at where are you at with the lord are you following all of his commandments are you doing what god wants you to do so that you might have a right to the tree of life [Music] how many just needs closer walk with the lord and say god i want to obey everything you said raise your hand say lord here i am lord jesus you see almost every hand in here raising up saying god we don't want any part of this other group lord jesus we're not the children of cain or the children of disobedience father you've brought us to you to yourself lord and that's why we come to worship you in spirit and in truth we want to do everything that's pleasing to you father and we ask god tomorrow lord as we go on our jobs and then we do to finish out the rest of the week lord we just ask god that you'd help us to continue in our minds have it on you lord jesus and saying god draw me closer to you make me more like you lord jesus for we know that you have to come soon lord jesus for satan's eden is certainly coming to a climax and lord we don't know what it'll be it'll be complete chaos after a while but lord you've called dear messenger your messenger has called us out of this chaos unto yourself lord jesus and we thank you lord for what you have done in our hearts and lives lord we ask god that you look beneath every
