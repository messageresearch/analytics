[0:00] I can worship
[0:04] so let's just do that because we really
[0:07] worship God not only in spirit but also
[0:09] in truth amen amen and so uh you know
[0:12] that says the word comes forth the
[0:14] worship
[0:15] him in that but certainly amen uh you
[0:18] know when we go to worship to God it's
[0:20] not about looking at the neighbor or
[0:21] who's here who's not but it's by closing
[0:24] our eyes is just really really seriously
[0:26] worship to God
[0:27] and bringing his atmosphere
[0:30] without amen
[0:33] amen praise the Lord God is good
[0:35] amenities
[1:02] here
[1:06] the Lord hear thee in the day of trouble
[1:08] the name of God of Jacob defending
[1:12] now
[1:16] remember
[1:20] still
[1:23] alive
[1:28] we will rejoice in thy salvation in the
[1:31] name of our God we will set up our
[1:33] abandons the Lord fulfill all by
[1:36] petition
[1:39] thank you
[1:49] Lord
[1:56] [Music]
[2:10] you know as you get older and you
[2:12] realize you know
[2:14] talking I say you know
[2:18] when I'm 63 now but I told him the
[2:20] original Mountain I wouldn't apply there
[2:23] isn't you know what I mean by
[2:27] the things I did as a young man I
[2:29] enjoyed and I don't regret was spending
[2:31] people sometimes paying your question
[2:34] the things you did if you got mad but so
[2:36] I don't regret you know the mountains I
[2:38] climb the places I've been but somehow
[2:40] Church of Christ they have pain you
[2:42] should read in this uh
[2:44] uh
[2:46] treasure here
[2:48] the seventh verse
[2:49] it says SunTrust and Charities and some
[2:52] horses but we will remember the name of
[2:54] the Lord Our God and that's the age
[2:57] we're in everyone is trusting in some
[2:59] Professor whether it's in their wealth
[3:01] or you know whatever that is you know
[3:04] that doesn't mean anything it won't be
[3:07] with you on the other side so the only
[3:09] thing we can really trust me is the
[3:12] experience
[3:17] you guys whether you're young
[3:22] revolves around the simple faith in
[3:25] Jesus Christ this morning if you would
[3:27] challenge me
[3:28] uh I'm just going to read one verse and
[3:31] then I'm going to go
[3:39] determining that I don't mean to be
[3:41] funny about that but yeah I was just
[3:44] thinking you know as being genetic
[3:45] downsizing you see all the things you
[3:48] require from the time you were your
[3:51] young 1820s and now you're in your 60s
[3:54] and you realize those things were
[3:56] important for your men but now at 60
[4:00] that are not important anymore to wind
[4:02] up giving away or throwing away the
[4:04] things she thought were employed 40
[4:07] years ago
[4:08] but uh I was just
[4:11] read this first couple of verses here I
[4:15] excuse me I deceased you therefore
[4:18] Brethren by the mercies of God
[4:21] thank you
[4:24] represent your bodies
[4:26] unsacrificed holy and acceptable unto
[4:29] God which is your reasonable service and
[4:32] I was thinking this morning it's more
[4:33] than just dividing in the age that we
[4:36] are not on the entire religions here but
[4:39] as I read the scripture you could add
[4:40] something else
[4:41] to do this morning as I finish I just
[4:43] teach you therefore brother and by the
[4:45] mercies of God that you present your
[4:47] mind yes congratulations where the very
[4:51] thoughts around you try to take you away
[4:54] from the word of God or serving the word
[4:56] of God and serving the lord it's we're
[4:59] in an age right now where you have
[5:01] so many different things they didn't in
[5:04] Halls they only had
[5:06] the written word or the spoken word now
[5:09] you can see it on video you can hear it
[5:12] on radio you there's so much more to
[5:14] distract you you it's not just your body
[5:17] you have to present your mind on the
[5:19] soul also but I'll just re-read it again
[5:21] and then go to Q is 12. I seek you there
[5:25] for a Brethren by the mercies of God
[5:26] that you present your body as a Living
[5:28] Sacrifice only in itself
[5:31] oh
[5:32] God
[5:34] causes your reasonable service
[5:37] be not conformed to the world but be
[5:39] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[5:41] that you may prove what is good and
[5:44] acceptable and the perfect
[5:46] well I'm not going I know I read a lot
[5:47] but
[5:49] that's really important for you let me
[5:52] turn over here if I don't lose my
[5:55] presenting a couple of notion important
[5:58] but turn into Hebrews the 12th chapter I
[6:01] kind of
[6:07] over and over
[6:10] again let me read this uh
[6:13] a couple of these scriptures here
[6:15] wherefore seeing where
[6:16] also Compass about some greater thought
[6:19] of witness British flag side every way
[6:22] of sin which doesn't so easily possess
[6:25] and that's fun with patience the race
[6:28] with the second floors
[6:30] you know we have a great crowd of
[6:32] goodness also for us this day and age
[6:36] you have the written word of God
[6:41] this morning you have that ability to be
[6:45] successful and it goes on to say looking
[6:47] onto Jesus the author and the finisher
[6:49] of our faith who for the joy that was
[6:51] sent before him endured the cross
[6:54] despise him ashamed and sat down at the
[6:57] right hand of the Throne of God for you
[6:59] we're consider him ignored such
[7:01] contradictions centers against himself
[7:04] we should be wary of feigning your minds
[7:07] and he goes on and said hey you have not
[7:11] resisted onto blood striving against him
[7:13] you have not forgotten the exhortation
[7:15] will speak without you his children my
[7:18] son responds not thousand of the Lord
[7:21] nor faith when thou art
[7:24] For Whom the lord loves teach us and
[7:27] discourage every son he was received you
[7:30] know that's very important this morning
[7:32] you know God builds up our character at
[7:34] this point
[7:41] you know everything we do in life is not
[7:43] perfect so God has developing us it's
[7:47] perfect well and sometimes that's
[7:48] through hard enough
[7:51] from time fresh food easy enough but God
[7:54] is going to develop a character in you
[7:56] that you need on that day this morning
[7:58] and it might be for some time
[8:02] uh it's a hard scrub some of us are hard
[8:05] heads and it takes a lot of beating and
[8:07] a lot of a lot of falling and getting
[8:09] out again before when we realize what
[8:12] God's trying to do for
[8:20] [Music]
[8:27] takes a lot of things a lot of struggle
[8:30] a lot of God bringing us down on our
[8:34] feet again bringing us down to our knees
[8:36] to realize that we're feeling too much
[8:38] in our own strength and we're not doing
[8:40] anything
[8:42] but I I was uh
[8:45] thinking about what I was listening a
[8:47] couple of messages this morning that I'm
[8:50] not going to say where I'm going to say
[8:52] but the thing that really struck me this
[8:54] morning with us as believers
[8:56] and so we try them
[8:59] hard in our lives but do everything we
[9:03] can to be a Son of God or a daughter of
[9:06] God
[9:07] I'm gonna wind up in real life we're
[9:10] doing in our own strength and in our own
[9:12] ability and not
[9:15] we're not stressed with the scriptures
[9:17] we're not pressuring the holy spirit
[9:20] that God gives us
[9:22] but we want to do
[9:24] on his time
[9:25] but I believe
[9:32] this is uh just some some paragraphs
[9:36] that I read this morning and it says
[9:38] you know as a as a body of Christ
[9:41] you have the full power of God
[9:44] this morning and the only thing they're
[9:46] living at you this morning
[9:49] manifesting in your heart of life this
[9:52] morning is your faith certainly
[9:57] God doing the things
[10:04] to act upon him and that's all
[10:08] always
[10:10] just simple we tried making some
[10:13] complicated
[10:15] sometimes but the more
[10:18] simple event
[10:19] in the gospel the more reality you'll
[10:22] have
[10:23] when you are walking out of Faith this
[10:26] morning that God's able to do things for
[10:28] you
[10:29] you know it's not being simple here this
[10:32] morning but these brother man always
[10:33] talks about childlike Faith simple Faith
[10:36] just believe in God because he is God
[10:38] and walking out on faith believing
[10:41] what he's going to do for you and uh
[10:45] and he this is a it's he's on full Full
[10:48] paragraphs here
[10:50] let me everybody try it no you're going
[10:53] to lose it right here see Faith yourself
[10:56] you don't know you have that's right
[10:58] it's just a gift it's just say well you
[11:00] can't well you can't touch the vowel
[11:03] short how do you know
[11:05] what he's trying to say is Faith is a
[11:07] real simple problem this morning it's a
[11:10] real simple way
[11:16] [Music]
[11:24] I've lost my whole track of mine here
[11:27] this morning but I'll just read a few
[11:28] scriptures
[11:30] have you forgotten your expectation
[11:32] would speak about to you my son despite
[11:35] not the chastising my lord your faith
[11:37] when God
[11:38] waste my hand
[11:40] sometimes not allowing my enemies
[11:43] sometimes to bring my faith about when I
[11:46] am getting chasing your reviews and I'll
[11:48] say if you and your chest and God deal
[11:50] with you as good times with son swim in
[11:53] the father chasing down but if he be
[11:56] without chastising him wherefore all are
[11:59] you contagious then you are bastards and
[12:01] not Sons father
[12:03] foreign
[12:52] chastising for the presence seems to be
[12:55] choice for three years nevertheless
[12:57] and yield that the peaceful rooms of
[13:00] righteousness unto them which are
[13:02] exercised thereby
[13:04] where
[13:08] was talking about here lift up hands
[13:12] which act down and the feeble knees have
[13:15] been straight past where your feet
[13:17] at least how much his land he turned out
[13:19] of the way but rather be evil
[13:22] and then like he was talking about
[13:24] talking about him reading about it
[13:26] brings her mom on the scene bought peace
[13:30] with all men and Holiness without which
[13:31] no man shall see the Lord look at these
[13:34] diligently we stand a man Fallen by
[13:37] Earth stopped on top at least anywhere
[13:39] division is screaming off trouble
[13:42] thereby many people fall but that's
[13:45] really speaks of
[13:47] this morning that it's an age where
[13:50] people are just so angry so better at
[13:53] each other
[13:55] we don't have Christians we don't want
[13:57] those attributes and all our hearts
[14:00] he's there I'm going to stop by there
[14:03] but uh
[14:04] you know I was
[14:06] I was thinking this morning in my own
[14:10] life as uh as I get older and you know
[14:13] this question is one of the messages
[14:14] that brought around this morning and I
[14:17] realized
[14:18] for myself I can only speak to myself
[14:21] but I just simply need I have a starring
[14:24] beans and rather downsizing I realized
[14:26] just like brother we're talking about
[14:29] unpacking all those things that you
[14:31] don't need to be preparing them in your
[14:33] hard drive
[14:36] I just need 11 more color and just let
[14:38] God out of his way you know not old to
[14:40] the things that I've known
[14:42] just let God speak to me and just walk
[14:45] away he wants me to walk Brother David
[14:51] thank you
[14:57] remaining about the Lord this morning
[15:01] unless they understand saying I won't
[15:03] Force this morning because he is the
[15:05] Lord

[41:50] understands the Lord man you know that's
[41:53] awesome
[41:58] [Applause]
[41:59] that someone regrets my life I have if I
[42:02] didn't start surfing younger than what I

[42:22] picture
[42:28] [Applause]
[42:29] amen we all do and we're all part of
[42:32] each other and we're a family
[42:35] amen and now we have wonderful singing
[42:37] how about a little testimony
[42:41] of What the Lord Has Done because how
[42:42] many times that's what he's all about
[42:49] how excited it is to be a Christian amen
[42:53] I mean you think of the possibility
[42:56] the Lord will do for you next amen I
[42:58] mean he's going to change your body
[43:03] we have a bright future
[43:06] you got a lot to be excited about it
[43:08] thank you Lord to worship God for us
[43:13] it's important that didn't kill you yet
[43:16] they did 68 Million numbers
[43:18] amen
[43:21] your life and then you've got a good for
[43:23] God's face
[43:38] okay very nice
[43:41] and uh
[43:42] we started off on Wednesday night
[43:44] because of meeting at the church and uh
[43:47] and uh for that information I don't
[43:50] remember if you said Wednesday or Friday
[43:51] night one thing that stood out to me he
[43:54] said uh Satan is afraid of what one Ergo
[43:58] will do for your faith or if you can get
[44:00] up one or one will do your faith just
[44:02] take to the next level that really
[44:04] dropped in my heart
[44:05] um because I know sometimes like on the
[44:07] Christian walk it can see like inside of
[44:09] so many prayers and so imagine I still
[44:11] keep the answer but we're just not
[44:12] seeing that the way we want to see a
[44:14] dancer and so I was kind of discouraged
[44:16] sometimes I've been praying for healing
[44:17] for some things
[44:19] and for Elena showing her stuff for my
[44:21] ankles different
[44:23] but I'm just pick up on that and leave
[44:27] on that if I just get that one Miracle
[44:29] just one thing that I can just believe
[44:31] on so as many of you know um I've been
[44:34] left as a tolerant for many years and um
[44:37] it's just brutal and
[44:39] [Music]
[44:40] even a little less than cheese or
[44:42] anything it just set me off a milk ice
[44:44] cream all that stuff so I have to carry
[44:46] around a big pill while the library and
[44:48] every time I'm going to have cheese or
[44:50] anything I can take like five six pills
[44:52] that's just
[44:53] and if you have something to eat
[44:55] something that you didn't know that was
[44:56] in there well it's gonna be a time so
[44:58] um I think it was Friday night uh after
[45:01] the meeting they were serving a staff
[45:04] and uh it was cold and stormy outside
[45:06] our cabin where you're staying way far
[45:08] away from the mess hall and uh me and
[45:11] Lee are up to the front for the line I
[45:13] saw the pizza for a snack and uh so I
[45:16] asked them like hey you got my bills
[45:18] right
[45:25] all right foreign
[45:55] about that for you
[45:58] okay and uh I never really thought of it
[46:01] it was just such a simple thing there
[46:02] was a solution for it with Bill so I
[46:03] never thought I was getting healed from
[46:05] it and uh so we got
[46:09] mine and I
[46:10] just took one slice of pizza went up to
[46:13] my seat and uh I was like I need to pray
[46:16] over this pizza and I'm very so sincere
[46:18] for that one little piece of pizza and
[46:21] uh so I ate it and just believed and
[46:24] stepped out and I hate that it's about
[46:26] to happen
[46:27] as I can usually with at least five
[46:29] minutes I've had to put out there and uh
[46:32] so I was like all right that was kind of
[46:34] you know the devil started talking to me
[46:38] he didn't have that much cheese on there
[46:40] just different thoughts like that and I
[46:42] was like no that's all right
[46:44] so the next night I just kept playing it
[46:47] kept leaving it the next night they had
[46:48] cheese and bread with dinners
[46:50] tonight see what happens so I took two
[46:53] pieces I'm right over that very
[46:55] sincerely again and just believed and um
[47:02] [Music]
[47:12] so
[47:15] um
[47:16] then on Sunday afterwards Leo would
[47:19] wanted Mexican food when we were coming
[47:21] down to the camp so we bought Mexican
[47:22] food and then we went to a friend's
[47:24] house named pizza and I was like well
[47:25] now it's been a female test so just
[47:27] three slices of pizza cheesy Mexican
[47:29] food all but things all or nothing and
[47:31] just nothing happened I began to testify
[47:33] people in the kitchen I'm like I'm
[47:35] Healed
[47:38] okay
[47:40] [Applause]
[47:42] I was I couldn't believe it so I was
[47:45] really happy with that my parents house
[47:47] to search for testified on Monday
[47:49] evening the two things that would set me
[47:51] off the worst was ice cream
[47:53] straight around two percent little so on
[47:56] Monday evening I lived with my parents
[47:58] region and they're like poured some ice
[47:59] cream in there I remember when Peter got
[48:01] out of the boat he was he was walking he
[48:04] was watching when he started to look
[48:05] around and start getting nerves well I
[48:07] see the ice cream there I literally was
[48:09] afraid of the ice cream and I was like
[48:11] man that's just not so bad and Satan was
[48:14] like just on my case and I'm afraid of
[48:17] it and so I left the room I love the
[48:19] crate on the floor I can't start
[48:20] doubting now I know you healed me and
[48:23] even if this does cause an accident well
[48:25] I don't care I don't just go first I
[48:27] went in the kitchen
[48:28] scooped up some ice cream and had it
[48:31] like a big bowl of it and I just
[48:33] testified everybody in there I said I'm
[48:35] gonna eat this ice cream
[48:38] Laura already touched me
[48:43] all the things nothing happened it was
[48:46] just been a total healing I just want to
[48:47] thank the Lord amen and I know some of
[48:50] the Bride says stood up to this point
[48:51] because I was talking awesome I'm going
[48:53] to church about him he's like you feel
[48:55] like anything when I come over how are
[48:57] you did it feel like a cold chill or
[48:59] like anything that was like no a number
[49:01] of the Browns wrote that quote about
[49:02] sometimes I think it's so simple you
[49:03] don't even know it's there and it was
[49:05] just it was just it didn't feel like
[49:07] anything out of the hotel you don't like
[49:08] it came down I was like taking this over
[49:11] or anything like that I'm just like I
[49:13] said God
[49:15] and God works like meal so I'm gonna
[49:17] believe it and not a big deal I don't
[49:19] feel anything special at that and just
[49:21] thought drop drop that bait down there
[49:22] so I just wanted the Lord
[49:25] [Applause]
[49:31] thank you
[49:35] Sam is an Amazing Grace
[49:40] [Applause]
[49:53] [Applause]
[49:57] [Music]
[50:03] foreign
[50:08] [Applause]
[50:11] [Music]
[50:24] [Music]
[50:34] [Music]
[50:36] thank God
[50:44] [Music]
[50:47] [Applause]
[51:00] [Music]
[51:05] so very much
[51:16] [Music]
[51:21] foreign
[51:44] [Music]
[51:58] what we normally would but as you turn
[52:01] them in your Bibles we want to read out
[52:02] the book of Hebrews chapter 11.
[52:05] I think we will go right along with the
[52:07] things that have been said and done this
[52:09] morning and
[52:11] you know I didn't really put a title on
[52:13] this but as I was listening to the free
[52:15] service and so forth last night I
[52:17] thought if you know if I could put a
[52:19] title on her if I would put a title on
[52:20] this
[52:21] it would be the way maker amen and when
[52:25] we reach after 11 Hebrews
[52:29] we know that we're in a world of
[52:30] negativity
[52:32] that's what we're facing and you know
[52:35] the prophet said that there's a real
[52:36] there's a focus if there's a real dollar
[52:38] there's a counterfeit
[52:39] if there's Faith there's fear there's
[52:41] doubt there's belief and dark good and
[52:44] evil positive negative
[52:46] and if you're a Christian this morning
[52:50] the negativity is is even more poured
[52:54] upon you from the world the world's
[52:56] against us we're living in the most
[52:58] negative place outside of hell and none
[53:00] of us are going there right
[53:03] that the world has ever seen and you
[53:07] know the negativity surrounds us but
[53:09] that doesn't mean we have to fall into
[53:11] that trap of negativity yeah our
[53:13] children should have to follow oh man
[53:15] and
[53:19] I read a stat the other day that said
[53:22] the average on the average an 18 year
[53:24] old child or a young adult 18 year old
[53:27] has been told no or you can't do
[53:30] something over a hundred and fifty
[53:32] thousand times
[53:36] wow
[53:37] yeah think about that you better know
[53:42] or you can't do something a hundred and
[53:44] fifty thousand times
[53:46] but my Bible tells me differently
[53:49] and so today we want to look at that and
[53:52] we'll read out a portion we're going to
[53:53] try to keep you staying home but I don't
[53:55] want to read several
[53:56] uh several of the verses out of Hebrews
[53:59] chapter 11.
[54:05] and it says now Faith is the substance
[54:07] of things hoped for
[54:09] the evidence of Things Not Seen I like
[54:11] that when we look at that word substance
[54:14] substance okay
[54:16] for it the elders are coming to do the
[54:19] report
[54:20] through faithful things which are seen
[54:22] or not made of things
[54:24] which do appear by faith Abel offered
[54:31] I've got a more excellent sacrifice the
[54:34] King by which he obtained the witness
[54:36] that he was righteous God testifying of
[54:40] his gifts and by it not being dead yet
[54:43] speaking so here's Abel now think about
[54:45] this here he had the foresight and
[54:47] here's what we could talk about faith
[54:49] and fear
[54:50] Abel had the foresight to see so far
[54:54] into the future that he could see that
[54:57] there was going to be a bloody lamb to
[55:00] die on the cross of calvary
[55:03] now that's faith
[55:06] something something was placed inside
[55:08] him that he could see that far in
[55:11] advance to say hey this is not about
[55:13] beauty and flowers and and crops and he
[55:16] said this
[55:17] it's about a bloody ram somebody that's
[55:19] going to sacrifice this is what a
[55:21] sacrifice is yeah that's his faith
[55:26] huh
[55:27] I mean
[55:28] Enoch was translated he should not see
[55:32] death and was not found because he had
[55:34] this testimony
[55:36] that he pleased God so now we're looking
[55:39] at Enon Enoch had the foresight to see
[55:42] that we're going to take a rapture
[55:47] that there is a possibility
[55:50] so that there will be a group of people
[55:52] that can leave this place in the moment
[55:55] in the twinkling of an eye without dying
[55:58] yeah
[56:00] think about this this is the most
[56:01] powerful one of the most powerful
[56:03] chapters in The Bible and we Overlook it
[56:05] so many times because we've heard it
[56:06] over and over and over right well I'll
[56:08] tell you we need it over and over and
[56:09] over and I need it over and over and
[56:11] over build my faith Lord
[56:15] but without faith it is impossible to
[56:17] please him
[56:18] for he that comes to God must believe
[56:21] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[56:24] them that diligently seek him so that
[56:26] tells me right there that if you're
[56:27] going to be praying to God if you're
[56:28] going to be seeking God
[56:30] I better know who God is
[56:33] you have to have that faith for him to
[56:35] reward you yeah
[56:37] no it's more than just hope amen yeah
[56:40] Glory
[56:42] my faith Noah being warned of God of the
[56:44] things not seen as yet moved with fear
[56:46] prepared an art to the saving of his
[56:48] house in which it was condemned
[56:50] condemned the world it became heir of
[56:52] righteousness
[56:54] which by faith which is by faith heir of
[56:58] righteousness
[57:00] who is that today that's us we're the
[57:02] heir of righteousness we're the heir of
[57:04] all four things we're the air because we
[57:05] are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[57:09] about Saint Abraham when he was called
[57:11] to go out to a place where she should
[57:13] after a receipt for an inheritance obey
[57:15] that he went out not knowing whether he
[57:17] went by faith he subturned to the land
[57:19] of promise in a strange country wealthy
[57:22] Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob
[57:25] shares with him of the same promise
[57:29] for he looked for a city which had
[57:31] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[57:33] gone he could see someone
[57:37] substance
[57:40] to the world to those around
[57:42] they thought he was crazy
[57:45] but he said I see this I can I can see
[57:48] it as plain as they it's real to me I
[57:50] know it's real I know God is making
[57:52] something happen here and there
[57:55] is a city whose Builder and maker is God
[57:57] yes thank you Lord that's right through
[58:01] faith also Sarah herself receives
[58:03] strength to conceive seed and was
[58:05] delivered of a child when she passed
[58:07] AIDS because she judged him faithful who
[58:09] had promised therefore spring there even
[58:12] one of him as good as dead so many as
[58:15] stars of the multitude of the sky
[58:23] all these died in faith
[58:26] all these people have this faith and
[58:28] what's it say next not having received
[58:31] the promises but having seen them before
[58:33] or off
[58:35] and were what Chris Lane
[58:39] today that God is the Mighty God yes and
[58:43] God is a faithful God I stand persuaded
[58:46] that I'm going to take a Rapture I'm
[58:48] going to I stand persuade that I can
[58:50] live a positive life I don't have to
[58:52] dwell in the neighborhood I stand
[58:53] persuaded that I can be victorious this
[58:55] morning yes
[59:02] straight from being your house this
[59:04] morning
[59:06] yes Lord we definitely feel your
[59:09] presence amongst us and we pray that you
[59:11] just have your will your way this
[59:13] morning Lord that you yes Jesus what
[59:15] you've laid on my heart yes
[59:17] help us all to relax and yes
[59:23] and we just want to tell you we love and
[59:25] we appreciate it we dedicate this
[59:26] service completely into your control and
[59:29] into your hands yes
[59:31] amen amen you can have your seats
[59:34] is a rather long chapter I keep you
[59:36] standing too long
[59:39] we'll bounce around a little bit in here
[59:41] but chapter verse 17 says by faith
[59:44] Abraham when he was tried he offered up
[59:46] Isaac that he would receive the promise
[59:48] offered up by his only begotten son by
[59:51] faith Isaac blessed Jacob but he saw
[59:54] concerning what things do come
[59:59] that gives room for the devil to throw
[1:00:01] in some doubt but
[1:00:03] so these guys had to overcome and how to
[1:00:06] stand on faith and the word tells us
[1:00:08] late that he stood there by faith with
[1:00:10] concerning the things that were to come
[1:00:12] and by faith Jacob when he was dying he
[1:00:15] blessed the sons of Joseph and they
[1:00:18] worshiped everybody Joseph when he died
[1:00:21] he made mention of the part of the
[1:00:23] children and then Commandments returning
[1:00:25] his bones he's alive he's saying I know
[1:00:27] what they're going to do you need to get
[1:00:28] my bones moving over here take them with
[1:00:30] us
[1:00:32] him
[1:00:37] by Moses when he was come to gears he
[1:00:40] what refused to be called the son of
[1:00:42] Pharaoh's daughter
[1:00:44] he had it all
[1:00:47] everything he could possibly want or
[1:00:49] need or Desiring life was laying right
[1:00:51] at his fingertips and he says I refuse
[1:00:53] to be called
[1:00:55] because that's not what I see myself man
[1:00:58] I can't place myself in that bondage and
[1:01:01] to go with that so he said I would
[1:01:02] rather suffer the afflictions of God
[1:01:05] everybody suffered and enjoyed these
[1:01:08] Pleasures for a season
[1:01:10] by faith Egypt
[1:01:13] and it says not fear
[1:01:15] and I want you to remember that I want
[1:01:17] you to think about that faith and fear
[1:01:20] cannot come as this
[1:01:23] did you realize that faith and fear
[1:01:25] cannot coexist
[1:01:28] and I want you to know this that your
[1:01:29] mind
[1:01:32] wants positive thoughts yeah Lord your
[1:01:36] mind was designed by God to think
[1:01:38] positive yes it is
[1:01:42] if I give you a statement you can't take
[1:01:43] it
[1:01:45] wants to try this on me yesterday and he
[1:01:48] said
[1:01:49] don't think about an elephant
[1:01:54] and then he said what did you think
[1:01:56] about I said elephant he said I thought
[1:01:57] you don't do it
[1:02:00] he said if I tell you don't do whatever
[1:02:02] you're going to do and think whatever I
[1:02:04] just
[1:02:06] thought I'd never thought about it that
[1:02:08] way
[1:02:09] but that's the truth our minds are
[1:02:11] programmed to think positive to stay
[1:02:13] away from the negative he was telling me
[1:02:16] don't do something don't do something I
[1:02:17] did exactly the homicide don't do I
[1:02:20] thought of enough you ever want to be
[1:02:22] sitting here thought of an elephant
[1:02:24] your minds are Incredible God
[1:02:27] is incredible yes
[1:02:30] and when we look at this today we think
[1:02:32] about this and you can't help but go
[1:02:34] further and think about this when when I
[1:02:36] went through the Red Sea it was by their
[1:02:38] faith that the land was dry
[1:02:41] and it says when the walls of Jericho
[1:02:44] failed what brought those walls down
[1:02:46] that was their faith
[1:02:48] it was their positive outlook in their
[1:02:51] faith of what God could do in their life
[1:02:54] and so I want to look and do things a
[1:02:57] little differently this morning I'm
[1:02:59] gonna like I said I'm gonna try to relax
[1:03:00] I'm not really preaching this morning
[1:03:02] I'm doing something a little different
[1:03:05] I'm going to speak to you from my heart
[1:03:08] something I've never done in public
[1:03:11] and I'm going to share a little bit
[1:03:13] about myself
[1:03:16] where I came from
[1:03:18] where I'm at in my life and what brought
[1:03:20] me to the spots I'm at in my life what
[1:03:22] God has done for me and more importantly
[1:03:24] what God can do for you amen yes Lord we
[1:03:29] hear all this talk about revival going
[1:03:30] on
[1:03:32] and I began to ponder and I began to
[1:03:34] think and
[1:03:35] you know I begin to think about this
[1:03:37] this for Bob's going on because I think
[1:03:39] why are so many people still living
[1:03:41] below their god-given rice
[1:03:43] yeah
[1:03:44] why would we call ourselves Christians
[1:03:47] and we're living life without victory
[1:03:51] [Applause]
[1:03:53] ourselves living without overcoming
[1:03:55] power why do we find ourselves uh not
[1:03:58] fully trusted God the confidence we
[1:04:00] should have in our heart
[1:04:01] that lives that no matter what we're
[1:04:03] going through God will see us through
[1:04:06] I truly believe that we should be the
[1:04:09] most Victorious of God praising people
[1:04:11] on the face of Facebook
[1:04:12] [Applause]
[1:04:15] yeah
[1:04:16] yes thank you Lord
[1:04:18] several times and you know I don't know
[1:04:20] uh
[1:04:22] I don't know why but several times
[1:04:25] over the last few months
[1:04:27] people have been asking me
[1:04:31] please don't take this wrong result I
[1:04:33] thank myself what's the things you've
[1:04:35] accomplished in your life
[1:04:37] how did you become a registered nurse
[1:04:39] how did you become successful in sales
[1:04:41] how did you become a confident speaker
[1:04:43] before
[1:04:46] how did you how did you do all this and
[1:04:48] then Thomas
[1:04:52] really
[1:04:58] but this kept coming on come on and then
[1:05:00] God kind of laid on my heart and says
[1:05:02] you know what people's looking and
[1:05:03] noticing you and they're noticing bits
[1:05:06] that I've done over you in your life
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:12] thank you Lord Jesus this is a hard
[1:05:14] thing for me to do because even though I
[1:05:16] love
[1:05:17] my life I tell you I can talk to a stop
[1:05:20] sign
[1:05:21] I'm a very private person
[1:05:23] my family were very proud to people
[1:05:26] parents are very proud to people we
[1:05:29] don't care a lot about ourselves or
[1:05:30] about what we're going through tonight I
[1:05:32] hope some people they just view
[1:05:34] everything on Facebook you know if the
[1:05:36] dog kind of hang tail you know
[1:05:37] everything
[1:05:38] that's not us that's not my people
[1:05:41] that's not the way we are
[1:05:44] Glory
[1:05:47] but I've learned early in Ministry
[1:05:53] you learn this
[1:05:57] the early in my Ministry I learned that
[1:05:59] brother knows what I'm talking about his
[1:06:01] kids know what I'm talking about you
[1:06:03] live in a fishbowl your whole life is on
[1:06:06] display before the people everything you
[1:06:08] do everything you say every word you go
[1:06:10] every act everything you do somebody's
[1:06:13] gonna see it and have a comment or a
[1:06:15] reaction to it
[1:06:17] it goes to the territory
[1:06:19] our kids they they take the worst part
[1:06:22] of it most of the time because of the
[1:06:24] kids do what kids do they're just kids
[1:06:26] but yet they're they're kind of picked
[1:06:28] apart you know that's the preacher's
[1:06:29] gift that's
[1:06:31] a semester you know
[1:06:34] and you're kind of picked apart yeah
[1:06:36] boys
[1:06:40] you better have broad shoulders and big
[1:06:42] skin
[1:06:45] and that's the way it is
[1:06:47] and we're okay with that
[1:06:49] but I want you to know from the very
[1:06:51] start as I began to get into this
[1:06:52] testimony in this event
[1:06:55] today
[1:06:56] that everything I have in life
[1:06:59] my parents my kids my wife my own my
[1:07:03] career everything I have I give complete
[1:07:06] glory to God yeah that's right I
[1:07:08] accomplished nothing yes amen that's the
[1:07:12] truth
[1:07:13] but I'm thankful that I can say that I
[1:07:15] give God the glory that every step has
[1:07:18] been completely orchestrated by him in
[1:07:21] my life and the people in my life
[1:07:25] when I began to think about this
[1:07:27] testimony and I I got to this point and
[1:07:29] I I realized that there were key moments
[1:07:33] in my life
[1:07:35] King people
[1:07:36] keep situation things that have happened
[1:07:39] years ago that have placed me where I am
[1:07:42] today that's right
[1:07:45] how did I not realize that you were in
[1:07:48] this from all from the very the
[1:07:52] [Applause]
[1:07:54] every stroke but I went through every
[1:07:58] trial I went through every Victory I had
[1:08:00] everything on one every time I something
[1:08:03] good happened it was you and the good
[1:08:05] and it was you in the bad leaving me to
[1:08:07] where I'm at today yeah that's right
[1:08:09] that's all they get to think about that
[1:08:11] I thought remember we start right here
[1:08:14] Proverbs 22 and 6.
[1:08:17] and it says train up the child in the
[1:08:20] way he should go and when he is open he
[1:08:21] will not depart from foreign
[1:08:43] I was encouraged I was inspired
[1:08:47] that's a young boy
[1:08:49] my parents always told me you can do
[1:08:51] anything you set your mind to
[1:08:56] I was taught to respect my elders
[1:09:00] I was taught morals I was called ethics
[1:09:03] I was taught to work hard and you'd be
[1:09:05] rewarded in life
[1:09:07] I was taught that sometimes life was
[1:09:09] important
[1:09:10] I was taught that
[1:09:13] death of those who was close to you
[1:09:15] could be cruel and hurt
[1:09:18] I lost a man when I was
[1:09:23] it still hurts
[1:09:25] she meant so much to it
[1:09:30] but walls turned about eighth grade
[1:09:33] yeah
[1:09:36] but I can remember that some Life Goes
[1:09:40] On
[1:09:43] the hurts to thank the grooming that
[1:09:46] life can throw at you but I just hope
[1:09:48] you get yourself up and be dust off
[1:09:51] and life goes on you pick up the pieces
[1:09:54] and you put it all back together I was
[1:09:56] taught that you pulled for a hundred
[1:09:58] dollars
[1:10:00] all right
[1:10:02] yeah
[1:10:05] and to hurt for those that are hurt
[1:10:10] I think about the underdog I I tell you
[1:10:13] what I
[1:10:15] I can watch a film today
[1:10:19] I just cry
[1:10:28] and composite they knew they were going
[1:10:30] to win no matter what you could push
[1:10:32] them to the limits in other words
[1:10:34] I can remember the story
[1:10:39] he was one of my favorites
[1:10:43] I can remember one of the first books
[1:10:46] that I can remember is that big royal
[1:10:48] blue
[1:10:49] kids Storybook of Bible
[1:10:52] probably everybody probably had it in
[1:10:54] their homes more than likely the big
[1:10:55] Royal Blue Book and Jesus on the front
[1:10:57] if I remember right animals on around
[1:11:00] him lamb and
[1:11:02] that was one of the first one of the
[1:11:03] books I remembered my parents give it to
[1:11:07] I also remember the first Bible that my
[1:11:09] parents gave me
[1:11:11] how I was encouraged to go to Vacation
[1:11:13] Bible schools and Sunday schools and
[1:11:15] always trying to be involved around that
[1:11:17] same to people with and you know Sesame
[1:11:21] Street that's what I want
[1:11:31] something to seemed horrible to happen
[1:11:34] to me
[1:11:35] or Elementary School
[1:11:39] Spears
[1:11:41] worry
[1:11:43] anxiety
[1:11:45] panic
[1:11:47] it came into my life
[1:11:51] every little time when I just knew that
[1:11:54] bad things were fixing to happen
[1:11:58] there was nothing I could do to combat
[1:12:00] it I just knew something bad was going
[1:12:02] to happen while I was at school mom was
[1:12:04] going to be in a car wreck dad would go
[1:12:06] get her to work out here and doing
[1:12:08] something while hearing about there's
[1:12:09] somebody in my family was dead or sick
[1:12:12] or hurt
[1:12:13] in the fear the word of the panic
[1:12:18] this was something mom and dad would
[1:12:20] help me with
[1:12:21] because they didn't understand they
[1:12:23] didn't know what they were at their
[1:12:24] wishes or we don't know what we're going
[1:12:26] to do why did somebody hurt you in
[1:12:28] school
[1:12:29] somebody knew someone
[1:12:32] no
[1:12:34] what's wrong
[1:12:39] so I would refuse to go to school and I
[1:12:41] would cry
[1:12:43] School
[1:12:46] well I was talking to anything I wanted
[1:12:48] in life and I told him I wasn't going to
[1:12:51] school
[1:12:52] kind of backside don't
[1:12:54] but I can remember he took me to my
[1:12:56] grandmother it was all the way and he
[1:12:58] said you need to drive up you've got to
[1:13:00] go to school we can't keep none of this
