None radant from hell. my holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace. Jesus Lord at thy birth. Jesus, Lord, at thy birth. Amen. Good morning. &gt;&gt; Morning. &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just greet each one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and want to welcome all our visitors. This is good to have each one. Brother Tommy's dad back there. God bless you. Amen. Just different ones. And so, Amen. We're looking forward to what the Lord has for us. We are certainly amend this kind of a special time. Amen. Because this is the time of the year I guess for centuries now that we've celebrated the birth of Christ. Amen. We know he was probably born in April and so forth, but Amen. It's quite something just to think that and and I'll just bear with me for a minute. Musicians and I told Troy I would just not have Bible reading this morning because I had just had something kind of come on my heart. Amen. that I want to share. Amen. Would that be okay? So, we'll just have a little something. Amen. It just came to me, you know, about um if there really is a Christmas, there really was a Christmas. There really was a time when God became flesh, Emanuel, and dwelt among us. Amen. They brought tidings of great joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we sing about it and we celebrate it. It's just as sure. Even our calendar, our time testifies that God came to the earth and died for us because our calendar is programmed from the death of Christ, isn't it? &gt;&gt; So even our calendar testifies that God came the first time. &gt;&gt; And if he really did, then praise the Lord, we know that forgiveness is real. There really is forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Ain't none of us perfect. We all have done a bunch of bad stuff in our life. &gt;&gt; Things we that haunt us perhaps things we don't like. But guess what? &gt;&gt; That's what he died for. He came to forgive. Thank God for forgiveness. Amen. That's what he did. When he died, we lived. Living he loved me. dying, he saved me. Paid the price, rising, dejustified. In other words, Amen. He justified us when he rose from the dead. Amen. &gt;&gt; And not only that, but if there truly is forgiveness, then there's also truly an infilling of God himself in our hearts &gt;&gt; because he says, "I'll not leave you comfortless. I will come to you." &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost, salvation is real. Christmas is real. &gt;&gt; Then forgiveness is real. &gt;&gt; Salvation is real. &gt;&gt; And it's real that if I go away, I will come again. How many believes God Jesus is coming again? &gt;&gt; He is coming again. And if Christmas is real, then there's a heaven to go to. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; There's a heaven to go to. And there's a hell to stay away from. &gt;&gt; And you have to make a choice in this life which one you want to go to, where you want to go. Amen. And so I thought that's real. How many believes all of those things are real? And in Mark, I like this in St. Mark after he rose again. Amen. This is kind of a resurrection story. Brother Brad will bring us the Christmas message, but I'll bring us a resurrection message this morning. Amen. Last chapter of Mark talks after Jesus was risen again, he was seen of different ones and after he appeared to all of his disciples, he upraded them for their unbelief unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not the ones that had told him that he was risen. And he said to them, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe the preaching of the gospel? Amen. That there is forgiveness. There is salvation. There is redemption. That's the gospel. Go everywhere. Tell that you CAN COME BACK TO GOD. YOU DON'T have to be in this condition. &gt;&gt; God came to bring us reconciliation back to God the way that Adam was before the fall. He says, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that believeth not shall be damned. Amen. So my thought is the only the real sin the real sin is to not believe. &gt;&gt; To not believe God and the record that he gave of his son is enough to cast you into hell. Not your bad deeds, not all of that stuff. That's all attributes of you not believing. Because if you believed and got filled with the Holy Ghost, you stop all that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Attributes of unbelief. The real sin is to not believe. &gt;&gt; That in itself will either save you. He that believeth, Amen, shall be saved. He that believeth not shall be damned. &gt;&gt; Wow. So it's important to believe. One more scriptures I'll make it short. And that's found in first John 5 and verse 9. If we receive the witness of men, how many knows in a courtroom and so forth, if somebody gives witness something, we believe them. It's kind of hard to nowadays, but you're supposed to be able when to put the Bible hang on the Bible and say, "I swear to tell the truth." That witness is supposed to be good. Supposed to be. So if we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God, which he hath testified of his son. He that believeth on the son of God hath the witness in himself, and he that believeth not, God hath made him a liar. In other words, somebody comes up and tell you says, and you say, I don't believe it. You're saying that you believe they're a liar. Not true. You're saying it ain't true. Don't believe it. Hath made him a liar because he has not believed the record that God gave of his son. How many believes Jesus came to earth? &gt;&gt; I believe Christmas. I believe that God did come to the earth &gt;&gt; to save us from our sins. Amen. Amen. And I don't just celebrate that during this season. Amen. We celebrate that all year around. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I trust and believe and hope that everybody here believes God &gt;&gt; because if you don't believe God, you'll be damned for it. Amen. So, thank God for his grace and for his mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. A merry Christmas to everybody. Amen. And just want to tell you that we love you. Looking forward to a good service and a good fellowship this afternoon together. Amen. So, we'll turn it over to brother David. God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's stand this morning. Amen. How many's glad to be in the house of the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. And what an awesome time. What an awesome message this morning we've already heard. Amen. That was that was wonderful. You love him. Let's bow our hearts this morning. Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning. We just want to tell you we love you, &gt;&gt; Lord. Just to be in your presence this morning, Father. and be a recipient of your goodness and your grace and your mercy in our lives. Lord, we're very thankful this morning. And Lord, I pray you'll bless each and every one that's here this morning and those that couldn't be here this morning. I just pray, Father God, that you would be with them most of all and speak to their hearts. Be with those that are streaming this morning, our shutins. Lord, may you just come and anoint the service this morning once again. May you walk up and down the aisles and speak to our hearts, Lord. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. You love him with all your heart this morning. Amen. I've got several songs, but this song I wanted to sing. This is the day that the Lord has made. I will be sad. And no, that's not the way it goes. I will rejoice and be glad in it this morning. Well, this is the day. Oh, this is the day. Oh, that the Lord has made. Oh yes, the Lord has made. Oh, and I will rejoice.

Him and Sister Laura's here this morning. And and Tori and I forget your other daughter's name. Don't tell her. I'm usually messing up somebody's name, but it's good to have them. And it's just it's just good to be a Christian this morning, isn't it? And it's good to see each and every one of our home folks this morning. And you know, and and and we just think of this time of the year. And you know, he come as a baby in a manger. But look at the things that he did. Not only did he save us, he's healed us. He keeps us alive and well every day. And he watches over us this morning. If it wasn't for God's grace this morning, there wouldn't any of us be here this morning. But, you know, I'm just so thankful that he loves me. And uh we're going to sing a couple songs. We got a lot of specials this morning. And and I told brother Matthew he's going to have to just take I'll give you I'll let him sing next time. But he told me he already had a complex cuz the last two times he's been here I've been gone and he said now I wouldn't let him sing. So, but anyways, we're glad to have him this morning. We're going to sing this song, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem. This is my favorite song. I love this song. Actually, I could sing it every time we come to church. I love it that much. Amen. Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shining far dim, giving a light for those who long have gone and guiding the wise men on their way unto that place where Jesus lay. Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on. Amen. Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem. Oh shine upon us until the kingom. Oh, give us the light to light the way into that land of perfect day.

With every breath I'm singing halleluah, hallelu, hallelu, hallelu, hallelujah. Yeah. A couple came to Bethlehem expecting child. They searched the inn to find a place for you were coming soon. There was no room for them to stay. So in a manger filled with hay, God's only son was born. Oh halleluah. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelujah. The shephers left their flocks by night to see this baby wrapped in light. A host of angels led them all to you. was just as the angel said, you'll find him in a manger bed. Emmanuel in sh.

Their frankincense and golden myrr they gave to you and cried out halleluah hallelu hallelu hallelujah I know you came to rescue me. This baby boy would grow to be a man and one day die for me and you. My sins would drive the nails in you. That rugged cross was my cross too. So every breath you drew was hallelujah. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelujah. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelujah. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. One minute. Okay. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; That was awesome, wasn't it? Amen. before I don't do everything I'm supposed to and we're going to do the prayer request and the offering. Brother Michael John, Brother John Hersburgger, Brother Paul, would you come help them take it up this morning? And and uh let me have that mic. Uh we have several prayer requests this morning, but I got a couple of praise reports. Uh, sister Peggy got to go home from the rehab center and she's doing a lot better a lot better. Brother David, her son, had told me. So, he he said to thank the church for your prayers very much and continue to remember her that that she will uh get stronger and do a lot better and the Lord will help her to keep that fluid off. We want to continue to remember sister parish that God be with her and and uh also uh my daughter, she went home this morning. I just ask that you would remember her in prayer and she has a friend. Her name is Sher Reagan and their family is it's a it's you know we celebrate life and her brother committed suicide yesterday and they're just kind of you know I don't know how they feel this morning but just pray that God will go and be with them this morning and and we just want to just pray that the Lord's hand of mercy be upon them and and also brother Sean he's all choked up this morning. We want to remember brother Shawn in prayer this morning that God will just move in a special way for him this morning. And Amen. And also we want to continue to remember McCagan and Paulie and and uh Palmer and uh you know Janet was reading me what sister uh Hannah had sent on the sister's page about the babies and isn't that a miracle? And uh I was telling a guy about it and he was he said, 'What is their name? He said, 'I want to pray that God will continue to move in their midst. And I thought, he is moving. He's alive and well this morning, you know. And they wanted them to abort Polly, but here she is. She's a fighter. And you know what? God gives life. Man takes life, but God gives life this morning. Amen. And we're going to ask brother Matthew if he'd come and pray over the offering in these needs this morning. Come ahead, brother Matthew. And we love and appreciate him very much. And Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Sweet Jesus, we just come before you, Lord. Lord, you're the high priest of our profession, Lord. when we submit and we surrender to your will, Lord, and then you lay on our hearts what to speak over ourselves and over our loved ones and over the rest of humanity. Jesus, this is the position you've put us in when we accept your word and we let you come and live inside of us. And so, Lord, we want to turn praise back to you for everything you've done and how you're moving and how we can see your glory and we can see your power moving down here in this world that's affected by sin and death and everything. And Lord, we're also coming. We're speaking life and we're speaking healing and we're speaking hope to the different prayer requests. Jesus, we were originally created, Lord, to be eternal and living with you. And then because of sin, then we're we're subject to all these negative things. But that's why that's why Christmas happened. So you could come and you could take the the punishment for all of that so that we could step back into our rightful position with you. And as sons and daughters of you, we we stand on your word and we take our position. And Lord, these different prayer requests, we thank you for them because they're your way of showing us how much you still love us. And it's your way of being able to move and just show your love to us. And so I ask that you'll move in these situations. We claim it, Lord. In your name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's look at the Let's sing that lorus again. Let your word be born as Emilyn gets ready to sing. Oh, let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it move in me. Hold me inside this house of clay and mold me every day. Be born in the manger of mine. Away in a manger, no crib for a bed. The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head. The stars in the sky looked down where he lay. The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay. The cattle are lowing. The baby awakes. But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes. I love thee, Lord Jesus. Look down from the sky and stay by my cradle till morning is night. Be near me, Lord Jesus. I ask thee to stay close by me forever and love me. I pray bless all the dear children in thy tender care and take us to heaven to live with thee there. and take us to heaven to live with thee there. Amen. I pray the song service has been a blessing to you this morning. And I told him I'd be willing to cut my part short. And sometimes I don't do a very good job of that. But we got one more thing to do before we ask brother Brad to come out. And you know, and we have a a pastor that we love very much and his wonderful wife. Bless her heart for putting up with him. But anyways, no, we love Brother Thomas and Sister Donna very much. And this has been a special year for our church. Through many trials and tests, we've come. But guess what? We're a winner today. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise this morning. Amen. Come ahead. Come up here, Sister Donna. Amen. And I know she don't really like to come up here, but that's okay. I get to embarrass her once a year. So, we love him very much. Come ahead, Brother Thomas. God bless you. We love you, buddy. Come on up here, Sister Donna. Amen. God bless you. That's for Brother Thomas. And sister Donna, you don't have to tell him how much we gave you this year. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you'all very much. I just want to say amen. It has been a special year, you know, because about a month ago, November the 6th, I think it was a year ago is when my wife was diagnosed with force &gt;&gt; stage four. &gt;&gt; Amen. Anyway, so I didn't do it, but I thought about November 6. Um, you know, it's was one year that, you know, they had pretty much send her home said nothing we can do other than make you comfortable. But by God's grace, &gt;&gt; the Lord said no. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen. And we believe it's going out of the lymph nodes, out of the lungs, and Amen. It's just going away. Amen. And we're so grateful that she's up to strength and feeling good and reclaiming their complete healing. Amen. It's all going to be gone. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Love you, baby. Amen. God is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand this morning. And I want to sing that song as Brother Brad comes. Oh, come all ye faithful this morning. Amen. Oh come all ye faithful joyful and triumphant. Oh come, oh come ye to be deathly hand. Come and behold him born the king of. Oh come let us adore him. Oh come let us adore him. You want colder? I'll get you one right here. &gt;&gt; The Lord sings of angels sing heaven. Glory to God. Glory in the highest. Oh come let us adore him. Come let us adore him. Oh come let us adore him. Christ our Lord. Amen. He's certainly worthy to be adored this morning. You know, thinking about Christmas and Christmas, you know, is not about a it's not about a party. It's not about a celebration. It's not not about exchanging gifts, but it's about worship. It's about thanksgiving. It's about about praising God for what God has done. It's about praising God for sending his son, his only begotten son, that whosoever will believe on him should have everlasting life. That's what Christmas is about. &gt;&gt; Certainly good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. And Roy, Kimberly, good to have y'all here. I tell you what, we've had prayer for Roy. If y'all y'all heard us talk about Roy, we've had prayer. He's battling a very familiar battle that's a lot of our believers around the world have had to fight. But you know what? He's still in the battle. &gt;&gt; He's still fighting. We're still believing God. &gt;&gt; Moving on the scene. Praise the Lord. Good to have you here. We love you guys. &gt;&gt; So, if you would turn in your Bibles as you're turning there and we'll turn to Isaiah chapter 7. Doing things a little different this morning. And you probably noticed and you know I've always been a paper pencil guy and I usually use a headset but I'm using an iPad today and a microphone. So uh oh could be right. Uh oh could be right. I've got pages in the back printed off. Don't don't think I didn't come prepared. So um we do want to look here in Isaiah chapter 7 and and verse 14. And while you're turning there I want to just take a little thought here. You know, Brother Ber said I'd be bringing the Christmas message. And this is a Christmas message, but it's it's it's a little bit different than probably a Christmas message you've heard before, but we want to just speak on it. The prophet tells us this as we're as you're turning. What is every name? He says, "Every name of every person will bear the name of what?" Jesus. He says, "The whole heaven is named Jesus. The whole church is named Jesus." Everything is named Jesus. For it's the only name that God ever had. He's called Jehovah. Jehovah Gyra, the Lord's provider, the Lord's sacrifice. Jehovah Rafa, the Lord that health thee. Jehovah, the Lord's banner. Manassth. Jehovah, the different Jehovah's. He's called the morning star. He's called the Father. He's called the Son. He's called the Holy Ghost. He's called the O Alpha and the Omega. He's called the beginning and he's called the ending. He's called the branch. Oh, he's called all kinds of titles, but he has one name. &gt;&gt; But he has one name. He says the father, father is not a name. Son is not a name. Holy Ghost is not a name. It's a title to a name. He says it's the name of three attributes that belong to one God. What was his name? The angel said, "Thou shalt call his name, &gt;&gt; Jesus. For he shall save his people from their sins." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 7:14. Therefore, the Lord himself give unto you to you a sign. Behold, a virgin s shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel. Now, we know that means God with us. Isaiah chapter 9, if you'll turn a couple pages there, verse six. For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulders, and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. One more place as we lay our foundation. Matthew chapter 1. I'll give you a second there. Matthew chapter 1. Matthew chapter 1 verse 18. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on the wise when he when as his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Notice this wasn't child of a Jew. It wasn't child of a Gentile. It wasn't child of an Egyptian or somebody from Arabia. This was a child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her public example, was minded to put her away privately. So here he is. Now, Joseph is going to save her from the humility of the of the community. He's going to save her from being mocked. He's going to save her from being made fun of and disgraced by the people for the condition that she finds herself in. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take thee, Mary, thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name &gt;&gt; Jesus. Isn't that amazing? We're going in from the Old Testament to the New Testament. Emmanuel. Jesus. You shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of in the Lord by the prophet, saying, "Behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is being interpreted as God with us." I want to speak this morning if we could entitle my message, "His name shall be called Jesus." Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning with grateful hearts. Thankful, Lord, just to be in your house once again and to serve you during this uh special time of the year and we just want to take a time today just to worship you, Lord. We've heard songs of praise. We've heard songs of gratitude and songs of worship, Lord. So we just ask Lord as when now we open the bread of life in the word as we begin to minister the word that it would just sink down into our hearts to help us to realize the true meaning of this season we call Christmas. Lord, we're so thankful that you sent your son to die. You sent your son to as a redeemer for the lost. You sent your son as a deliverer for those in in need of deliverance. We just want to tell you we love you. We appreciate you Lord and give you honor, praise, and glory. and may everything be said be pleasing to your ears today, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. You can have your seats. We're going to try to not hold you long. We've had a lot of preliminaries and we got the the the dinner afterwards, but we do want to take our time to worship. We want to take our time to lay the word out and to worship what God has done for us. And looking at this scripture here, we see that 700 years after the prophecy, now think about that. 700 years after the prophecy in the book of Isaiah, we have a young virgin girl here from Nazareth whose name was Mary. Now, she's engaged to this young carpenter boy. And so, as they're going through about their daily life, before they're married, an angel visits Joseph and comes to Joseph and says, "I want to confirm with you that Mary has conceived a child." Now, think about this. An angel of the Lord comes to me and says,"I want to confirm with you and let you know, Joseph, that Mary, the one you're espouseed to Mary, that she IS NOW WITH A child with the Holy Spirit." Now listen, Joseph, NOW I KNOW THIS MAY CONFOUND YOU. You may not understand what's going on, but you will call his name Jesus. Clear instructions. Clear instructions. in Matthew. When we look into Matthew, we understand that the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy is delivering an inspired revelation. And all of this is taking place from what the prophets had said 700 years ago. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So now we SEE THAT THE GOD of the Old Testament who had revealed himself in word form, the God who had demonstrated himself and carried himself in his work through the letter of the law and through written revelation to the people of that day. We're talking about a God who who who led the children of Israel into the promised land as a cloud by day and a fire by night. This very same God 700 years later is now going TO BE BIRTHED INTO A BODY OF FLESH. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO COME INTO A BODY OF FLESH. AND IN THIS BODY of flesh, a form of a man, a man that would be tested, A MAN THAT WOULD BE tried in every way you can imagine. A MAN THAT WOULD FEEL PAIN. A man that could get emotional. &gt;&gt; A man WHO WOULD CRY. A man who would hurt. a man who would have concern for those around him. He's not a god back in the laws anymore. NOW HE'S GOING TO COME INTO and he's going to BE THIS MAN. A MAN THAT COULD RESIST all temptations. &gt;&gt; A man that would come onto the scene and be tested and tried IN ALL WAYS. JUST LIKE YOU AND ME, Brother Tommy, just like you and me, Brother Troy. Just like you and me. He's going to be tested. He's going to be tried. He's going to go through these things. BUT THIS MAN WOULD overcome the world as WE KNOW IT BECAUSE HIS NAME WAS JESUS. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE DEFINITION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE A VICTORIOUS LIFE. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THAT DEFINITION. THE WORD TELLS US IN JOHN chapter 16 that Jesus has overcome the world. There is not a single THING THAT WE CAN ABSOLUTELY go through OR POSSIBLY GO THROUGH THAT JESUS HAS NOT ALREADY OVERCOME. &gt;&gt; So brothers and sisters, as believers and as followers of Christ and the MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, WE ARE GOING TO FACE TRIBULATIONS. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO FACE TRIALS. WE'RE GOING TO FACE TEMPTATIONS. WE'RE GOING TO FACE ALL THESE THINGS, HARDSHIPS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOUR EMOTIONS ARE GOING TO GET THE BEST OF YOU. &gt;&gt; YOUR HUMAN SIDE, BROTHER BER, IS GOING TO SOMETIMES GRAB AND GET A HOLD OF US and it's going to GET THE BEST OF YOU. YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF ON OCCASION having a little temper tantrum. &gt;&gt; You say, "CHRISTIANS DON'T DO THAT." YES, THEY DO. What world do you live in? Yeah, &gt;&gt; some of you's laughing. Some of you's looking at your husband. Some of you is looking at your wife. Some of you is looking at your neighbor. &gt;&gt; Every now and then, ANGER MIGHT JUST RISE UP FROM TIME TO TIME. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DAYS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DOUBTS. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FEARS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SICKNESSES THAT MAY COME ON YOUR WAY. YOU MAY HAVE SICKNESSES THAT WILL MAKE YOU WONDER, "AM I EVER going to make it through this?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; BUT PRAISE BE TO GOD THIS MORNING THAT CHRIST HAS A VICTORY. &gt;&gt; JESUS CAME AND HE'S VICTORIOUS OVER SIN, DEATH, HELL, GRAVE, WORLD through all the worldly troubles and everything that could that come come onto the believer. HE GIVE US A WAY OUT. &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE THAT? BECAUSE OF JESUS and that beautiful name of Jesus, the believer today can have peace. The believer today can have courage. The believer today can have hope and assurance AND KNOWING THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE. BUT THAT the victory can be had THROUGH CHRIST WHO DIED ON CALVARY. &gt;&gt; Listen church. The victory the victory doesn't remove the hardship. &gt;&gt; Oh, how we would love for it to. But the victory does not remove the hardship. The victory is there as a conquest. The victory is empowering believers to find a peace amongst life's challenges. THAT THROUGH THIS TRIUMPH, HIS TRIUMPH, we can find ourselves remembering that in the valley there's a mountain. &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT THE VALLEY, there is no mountain. And every day that we get up and every day we we get oursel up out of bed, we have to realize that without a battle, there is no victory. &gt;&gt; And when we talk about Jesus coming down onto the scene and we talk about JESUS COMING INTO FLESH, HE STEPPED DOWN FROM HEAVENLY brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; he stepped in from a heavenly realm into an earthly realm &gt;&gt; to fight the battle for you and for me. Do you realize what he gave up? He said, "Your ways are not my ways. You don't think like I think. I don't think like you think. Heavenly. You don't think heavenly thoughts. I don't think earthly thoughts. &gt;&gt; I'm a heavenly being." Jesus said, "And yet I'm going to come down to the earth and I'M GOING TO FIGHT your battles for you." &gt;&gt; I like the way the prophet puts it. He said, "Finally, one day they come to come by a royal seed, not born of a man, but conceived in the womb of a virgin by God himself with no sexual desire, Holy Spirit born." He said, "But when the Holy Ghost overshadowed that little virgin and conceived in there, the true seed of Abraham," how many, how many are the true seed of Abraham? Raise your hands, church, that's you. But when the true seed of Abraham, when that Holy Ghost had come in there and the true seed of Abraham, the faith that Abraham had in God, GOD HAD MADE A PROMISE to this seed born of virgin birth and that he had power over all the gates of the enemy. You want to talk about a Christmas message &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS COME DOWN ON THE SCENE AND WAS BORN IN THE AND birthed into the womb of this little virgin girl. And in that very womb, he has all of the power that he needs to overcome every gate of the enemy. &gt;&gt; And while he was HERE ON EARTH, HE HAD THE GATES OF SICKNESS in his power. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, we give the devil a whole lot of credit, brother Ber. We give him a whole lot of credit that he really don't have coming. You say, "Well, I'm sick. The devil's really after me. I I got this. I got that. The devil's really got me." No, that's not the way the word reads. IT SAYS HE HAD THE POWER. HE HAD THE g the gates of sickness in his hands. He spoke to the sick and the gates were opened up. So why do we let de why do we let the devil bind us? &gt;&gt; When the WORD SAYS HE SPOKE TO the sick and the gates OPENED UP AND THEY WALKED OUT FREE BECAUSE HE HAD THE GATES TO LEPROSY. Think about this in the Bible. When Jesus walked on the scene and there was lepers all around them and people were scared to go to him because they were afraid they were going to get the leprosy and he went and he just what did what? He unlocked the gate of leprosy and they became clean. &gt;&gt; When they were laying in the streets afflicted when they were laying in the streets years after years of being crippled and AFFLICTED WHEN JESUS WALKED BY HE JUST SIMPLY LOOKED down and said, "I'm going to unlock your gate to freedom." They got up AND WALKED. &gt;&gt; IT WAS JUST THAT SIMPLE. THAT'S WHAT HE DID. I'M GOING TO UNLOCK THE GATE. WHEN BLINDED EYES WERE THERE, HE UNLOCKED the gate of vision. Deaf ears, he unlocked the ears of hearing. And he owns that very key this morning. Brothers and sisters, if you could just let me tell you, IF YOU COULD JUST SWING those gates open, whatever your need is this morning, let Jesus take the key and unlock the GATE THAT IS HOLDING YOU BACK. &gt;&gt; If you were locked up this morning in a gate, in a prison house of depression, let Jesus take the key and open THE GATE AND FIND YOUR FREEDOM. YEAH, SIR. &gt;&gt; If you're in a prison this morning of doubt, maybe there's somebody sitting here say, "Man, I I don't know what this guy's talking about. I don't believe a word he's saying. I just can't believe it. I can't see it. I DON'T BELIEVE IT." UNLOCK. LET LET JESUS TAKE AND just put that key in that in that keyhole. Let him just take and put that key IN THERE AND JUST TURN THAT KEY AND LET'S SAY, GOD, OPEN UP MY HEART OF UNDERSTANDING &gt;&gt; THAT I COULD SEE YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE, JESUS. &gt;&gt; John 3:16. Some of us live behind gates of fear. Some of us live behind gates of anxieties. Some of us are living behind gates of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, &gt;&gt; fatigue, doubt. What trouble do you want to put in there? What's your trouble? Don't answer out loud. But many of us find ourselves living in a prison and we're bound up like a caged animal. And that's all you can think about is your hardship, your trial, your sickness, your fear, and you FIND YOURSELF LOCKED UP THERE. Sometimes people find themselves locked up behind a prison of lukewarmness. &gt;&gt; Let's think about this, brothers and sisters. Now, this church as a whole has been on fire. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AS WE'VE HAD TESTIMONY AFTER testimony after testimony, and we we see the Lord moving in in our young people and moving more and more every time, this church as a whole has BEEN ON FIRE. BUT SOME OF US ARE STRUGGLING with lukewarmness. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE THE FIRE IN YOUR BONES. &gt;&gt; They're on PEOPLE GET ON FIRE, brother B, FOR SO MANY THINGS AROUND THE WORLD. THEY GET ON FIRE FOR THEIR JOBS. &gt;&gt; THEY GET ON FIRE for their kids activities. &gt;&gt; They Oh, man. I tell you, we can hoop and holler. &gt;&gt; WE GET ON FIRE for for our money. We get on fire for a favorite television program. Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You get on fire for it. Can't wait till the next episode comes out. Man, I got to know what's going to happen. I think it's going to happen this way. No, no, no, man. We're going to wait. We just can't wait. We can't wait. Can't wait till that ball game comes on. I'm done talking about ball games. I got in trouble last time. I said, "We's going undefeated, going to win a championship." I think we're upside down in a in a whirlwind. Can't get out right now. But what has happened that has caused us to lose a fire? Now, I'm not asking you to raise your hand, but you know WHO YOU ARE. YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE SITTING HERE AND YOU THINK, "MY GOODNESS, I JUST DON'T HAVE THAT FIRE THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. I don't have that LOVE AND THAT JOY AND THAT EXCITEMENT WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THE WORD OF GOD. I DON'T CARE IF I GO TO CHURCH OR I DON'T go to church." &gt;&gt; Well, IF YOU DON'T CARE, THEN IT TELLS ME THAT YOU'RE NOT THAT that that you don't love the Lord the way you should. &gt;&gt; Because the word says if the love of God is in your heart, YOU'LL BE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD EVERY TIME those doors are open. But lukewarmness, it become you become a prisoner of lukewarmness &gt;&gt; and you will let everybody else do your work for you. &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T ON FIRE, so you need everybody else to do the praying. &gt;&gt; Oh, would you pray for this? Would you pray for that? Please pray for the Well, sure I will. But what are you going to do when it's answered? &gt;&gt; What What are you GOING TO DO WITH IT? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Are you going to start coming to church every Sunday, every Wednesday? Are you going to start testifying when God answers your prayers? When God meets your needs, when God gives you what you have need of? and you've asked everybody, every deacon, every every trustee, every preacher in the world to pray that this happens. Are you going to give God the GLORY AND START SHOWING UP to serve, to praise, TO WORSHIP, TO TRUST IN GOD? &gt;&gt; He's worthy of our praise. &gt;&gt; Now, just because you don't get your prayer answered every time, that doesn't mean that you don't come to church. &gt;&gt; I serve him if he answers. I serve him if he don't. Why? Because what else am I going to serve? &gt;&gt; People a lot of times will say, "Well, I don't ain't sure if you believe what I can believe exactly the way you believe." That's okay, BUT SHOW ME SOMETHING BETTER. &gt;&gt; Show me SOMETHING THAT WILL CAUSE YOU TO LIVE THE WAY OUR PEOPLE LIVE. &gt;&gt; Show me a word, a written word that will make you live better. Not that we're somebody. Not that we're better, not that we put ourselves, ESTEEM OURSELVES HIGHER, BUT IT'S THE WORD OF GOD. IT'S THE LIFE OF CHRIST LIVING FROM THE INSIDE, WORKING through the outside, making me act and do and talk the way I talk. &gt;&gt; That's the greatest gift. &gt;&gt; You want to know what the greatest GIFT IS? IT'S THE HOLY Ghost working in your life. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE HOLY GHOST MOVING IN YOUR CHILDREN. IT'S THE HOLY GHOST HEALING YOUR BODY. It's the Holy Ghost delivering you of the bondage that you're in. &gt;&gt; I know this ain't traditional. This ain't going down Jerusalem and Bethlehem, &gt;&gt; but we're going down the living room. But Jesus has the keys that can open those gates. Now when we think about these gates, lukewarmness, doubt, hatred, envy, malice, sickness, disease, we think about those gates and we SAY, "HOW MANY WOULD AGREE JESUS has the key?" &gt;&gt; Well, we better rewind and start preaching again BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET HOW MANY BELIEVE JESUS HAS THE KEYS? &gt;&gt; NOW, HERE'S WHERE WE HAVE TO BE BE RESPONSIBLE. If somebody comes in and says, "I've got a safe full of money and I've got a key and I'm gonna open the door." Hallelujah. Gold bars, silver bars, it's all yours. I got the key. I'm going to open the door. Are you going to sit on the outside of that safe, Michael John, and look in there and say, "Man, that sure is nice." &gt;&gt; No. No, look at he's smiling like a monkey in a banana sideways. He knows what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO JUMP IN THERE AND SAY, "THIS IS MINE." BECAUSE THE KING, THE MAN OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID, "I CAN HAVE IT ALL." BUT WE SAT THERE AND WE NOT WILLING TO WALK THROUGH THE DOOR. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO be willing as a believer to walk through the door AND SAY, "JESUS GAVE IT ALL. HE UNLOCKED IT. HE UNLOCKED ALL THE se gates to sickness, to depression, TO ANXIETY. WE'VE GOT TO BE WILLING TO WALK through the gates and take it and say it's mine and possess it. You know, when Daniel, the seed of Abraham was thrown into the lion's den. You think about Daniel down in that lion's den. He goes into the lion's den to be killed by these lions and the angel of the Lord comes up to him that night and stopped those lions. No doubt that great pillar of fire come down. The same pillar of fire that was with the children of Israel through the wilderness, THAT SAME PILLAR OF FIRE COME DOWN. And he SAID, "YOU KNOW, ANIMALS DON'T LIKE don't like fire. They don't like light." But that PILLAR OF FIRE COME down there and IT BEGAN TO SET over into the corner right there where that lion was. And there was Daniel and a face off face to face with this lion. And the pillar of fire comes moving in. THE PILLAR OF FIRE comes moving in. And there was Daniel right there. And the prophet said that that animal was so scared of the light, that big light lion set over there. And he said it laid down in that corner. &gt;&gt; Now that's somebody that's got a key to a gate. &gt;&gt; What was it? You say, "Well, God moved on the scene." WHAT WAS IT? I SAID, "DANIEL, listen to me. Daniel possessed the gate of that enemy." Daniel possessed the gate OF THAT ENEMY. DANIEL, HE SAYS, CLOSED THE MOUTH of the lion because God had promised that he was Abraham's seed and HE JUST ACCEPTED WHAT GOD SAID HE WAS ABLE to do for him. Is God able to give you your children back? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we've seen witness of that. Is God able to heal of your diseases? Yes, we've seen witness of that. IS GOD ABLE TO DELIVER YOU AND GET make you free in YOUR LIFE? YES, WE HAVE seen &gt;&gt; those three Hebrew children. They come into a place that they were thrown into a fiery furnace. WHAT WAS THAT INSIDE THAT FIERY FURNACE? THEY HAD POSSESSED THE KEY. THEY HAD POSSESSED THE GATES OF THAT FURNACE. The son of God had came down there and took the fire off of them. Now, could they do that? No. But they had the key. &gt;&gt; THEY KNEW WHAT GOD WAS ABLE TO DO. THEREFORE, they did not fear. They did not worry. THEY DIDN'T HAVE DOUBT. THEY SAID, "WE'RE GOING TO WALK INTO THIS FIRE. WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO THIS FURNACE AND GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF IT BECAUSE he said he would do it. &gt;&gt; Moses when he come in there, Moses coming there on the commission from God down to Egypt to bring those children out of the out of Egypt and into the promised land. The prophet said the devil draw a gate across him. They walk up to that Red Sea. Brother Eduardo, they walk up to that RED SEA. THE PROPHET SAID HE DREW A GATE RIGHT THERE WITH THE Red Sea in front of him and the old Pharaoh coming up from behind him. Nowhere to go. Couldn't go forward. Can't go backwards. But there was a gate right there. And there was a key right there surrounded by Pharaoh's army. And the key be to turn. He said the wind be to blow. The wind be to blow. They drove a It blowed so much that it blowed a dry streak right across that Red Sea. &gt;&gt; A key. &gt;&gt; A KEY THAT GOD'S people had possession of. You see, it was a key THAT THEY HAD POSSESSION OF. THEY COME INTO THE wilderness and the and the and the Jordan there. GOD SPOKE TO JOSHUA AND HE TOLD JOSHUA, he said, "Now I'm going to let you I want you to cross over that Jordan River. Make my people ready. Make my people ready in the month of April. Make them ready on the month that I'm going to flood this place." Remember, he don't think our thoughts. We don't think his thoughts. He's going to flood the place, but he's telling Joshua to make my people ready. Make my people ready as I get ready to flood this place. And I'm going to SPREAD THE WATER ALL ACROSS the valleys in this in this land right here. Now, this looked like a poor poor poor strategy. But, you know, sometimes we shouldn't be thinking about what God's plan is about our plan, but think about what God's plan is. GOD WAS PLANNING TO DO SOMETHING ON THE MIRACULOUS SIDE. WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS NO WAY POSSIBLE WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE THEY COULDN'T CROSS. When it looked like that that THE STRATEGY WAS SO BAD THAT THAT MUDDY JORDAN RIVER, THE WORST TIME IN the world and the in the day right there, the river at its highest. But brothers and sisters, MANY TIMES GOD LETS US end up down that same road. &gt;&gt; God will allow us to go down that same road when all seems hopeless. Think about this. Think about the Daniel in the lion's den. &gt;&gt; Think about the three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace. Think about uh the Moses here as he comes up to the Red Sea. Think about ju Joseph now or Joshua now as he's coming up to the sea and has to cross over THE JORDAN RIVER. GOD MANY TIMES WHEN IT SEEMS hopeless when all we know to do is to give up. &gt;&gt; WHEN ALL WE KNOW TO DO IS JUST CALL SURRENDER. I can't take it no more, devil. I can't take it no more. I'm at I'm at my wits ends. I'm at a roadblock and I can't get through it. I can't get around it. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER. THAT'S WHEN YOU CALL ON GOD. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER, HE'S GOT THE ANSWER. WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A WAY, HE MAKES A WAY. THAT'S OUR GOD. THAT'S THE key to the kingdom this morning. If you're a SEED OF ABRAHAM, GOD IS GOING TO HOLD on to his promise. IF YOU'RE A SEED OF ABRAHAM, GOD CAN GIVE YOU HEALING. GOD CAN GIVE YOU SALVATION. GOD CAN GIVE YOU YOUR CHILDREN. GOD CAN GIVE YOU YOUR JOY. I SAID GOD CAN GIVE YOU THE FIRE IN YOUR BONES LIKE YOU'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE. But sometimes it's at the end of the road. Sometimes it's at the end of the road and it looks worse than it ever did. &gt;&gt; The doctor says there's not a chance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; He don't know my God. &gt;&gt; You know, the devil is so dumb. just an absolute idiot to think that he can have dominion over anything my God says I can have. &gt;&gt; Think about this. If if somebody come to me AND SAID, "LISTEN, BRAD, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THIS PARTIAL of land and it goes from this corner to that corner to that corner to that corner. Do you think I'm going to let anybody else tell me what to do on that land?" Come on, church. Am I going to let anybody else come in there and walk in there and say, "Well, I think I'm going to cut a road right through here to get to MY PROPERTY." OH, NO YOU DON'T. BECAUSE I am the king of this kingdom. THIS IS MY DOMAIN. AND GOD SAYS, "IF I CAN HAVE IT, he can give it." &gt;&gt; He's more than able. &gt;&gt; Joshua didn't begin to think about how wide the Jordan River was. He didn't walk up there and say, "Man, this sure is muddy. I'm just going to get stuck in this bog. We need to get us some kind of shoes or something. Some kind of snowshoes or we got to put lay we got to lay us some boards out across here because this this has just become so muddy that if we don't do that, THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID. HE SAID, "GATHER YOURSELVES." &gt;&gt; He looked down there at THAT WATER AND HE SAID, "WELL, PRAISE THE LORD. GET READY, BOYS. GATHER YOURSELVES. WE'RE GOING ACROSS. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING ACROSS THIS RIVER BECAUSE I KNOW A MAN THAT'S GOT THE KEY. SO, SANCTIFY YOURSELVES. &gt;&gt; That's a lot of times that's a problem. We're ready to gather ourselves. We ready to go. We ready to do. But we fail to sanctify ourselves. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to help you. &gt;&gt; We got We can't get the cart in front of the horse. We got to keep things in order. &gt;&gt; SANCTIFY OURSELVES, GATHER OURSELVES, GET READY TO CROSS WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN US. BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT IN AN UNCLEAN, unfilthy way. &gt;&gt; But sanctify YOURSELVES AND FIND YOURSELVES. GATHER YOURSELVES. GET READY TO CROSS OVER THAT JORDAN RIVER BECAUSE GOD HAS A key to the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, we're living in an hour of possession. You hear the testimonies. WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE THIS IS AN HOUR of possession. It's an hour WHERE GOD HAS CALLED OUT TO HIS CHILDREN. WHEN GOD HAS CALLED OUT TO THE BELIEVERS, THE BRIDE JESUS CHRIST TO SAY, "LISTEN, THIS IS WHAT I MADE YOU to be." And you know what? Some of her is accepting it. &gt;&gt; Some of her is grasping A HOLD OF WHAT'S BEING SAID. SOME OF THEM are believing that WHEN HE SAYS YOU CAN BY HIS STRIPES OR BY MY STRIPES YOU CAN BE HEALED. There's a group OF PEOPLE THAT'S TAKEN A HOLD OF IT AND SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST HAD A REAL fresh revelation that the word of God tells me no matter what I'm going through, no matter what my sickness, no matter WHAT IT IS, THAT BY HIS STRIPES, the promise says I can at his will be free. Somebody ought to praise the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY OUGHT TO SHOUT AMEN THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say hallelujah this morning &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF WHAT GOD IS DOING IN THIS HOUR. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, it's an hour of possession. I just want you to have what he wants you to have. &gt;&gt; They smacked him on the face. They pulled the the hairs of his beard out of his face. They spit up on him. THEY THEY TRIED TO get him to do something that was wrong. They tried to get him to GIVE UP. THEY TRIED TO GET HIM TO QUIT. And Jesus said, listen to this. Jesus said, "I could speak to my father." And straightway he would send me 12 legions of angels. Now you think about how much God loves you. Satan tried to give him an out. All you got to do is just renounce what this whole mission that you come down from heaven. All you got to do is renounce all of that. I'll give you all this kingdom. Look out here, Jesus. You can have all of this and you never have to go to Calvary. And Jesus in reply, listen, I could call 12 legions of angels and my father would send them for me. But you know, the whole point of the story is he wasn't thinking about himself. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I MY FATHER COULD SEND 12 LEGIONS of angels for Elton, Kentucky. MY FATHER COULD SEND 12 LEGIONS of angels for the little assembly over here for Lacy, for Tammy, for Lisa, for Joe. Now, let's put this in perspective here. What this says, IT SAYS THAT JESUS HAS full authority and power. And it shows that he could easily overcome his capttors. He could call him down and say, "I I can send these angels to whoop every single one of you." But no, he chose. I SAID HE CHOSE TO GO GET THE KEYS. HE MADE A CHOICE TO GO GET THE KEYS to the kingdom from the pits of hell instead of calling a legion of angels. Let's put in perspective what this legion is. You know, a legion, we've talked about this, a Roman legion of 6,000 soldiers. SO HE COULD HAVE CALLED 12 LEGIONS. 72,000 angels at his beck and call. 72,000 angels at his beck and call. And Jesus emphasizes, I've got a limitless amount of angels. More than 12 legions could come at my beck and call. Let's talk about the power of these angels. There's a story in Isaiah chapter 37. I'll read it real quick. Third verse 36. Then the angel of the Lord went forth and smoked in the camp of the Assyrians 104 score and 5,000. When they arose in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. Let me tell you how many that was. One angel defeated 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. one. &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about 12 legions. We're talking about 72,000. Let me tell you that. I I'll just do the math for you. Don't get your calculators out. They they'll think you're texting in church, okay? 3,318 million enemies fallen at the 12 legions that he could have called. And we talk we and we think we got troubles. Listen to me. Let me tell you, THERE AIN'T ENOUGH DEVILS OUT OF HELL AND WHOOP THAT. THREE BILLION ENEMIES WILL FALL AT THE FEET OF THE 12 LEGION ANGELS. ALL WE NEED TO do is TO BE ABLE TO CALL ON GOD AND SAY, "GOD, SEND YOUR MINISTERING angels down TO US AND HELP ME WIN this battle. &gt;&gt; The battle's not mine. It's his." Said little David. Let me tell you, Joshua, Jesus, let's think about this. I got to slow down. I'm gonna finish before I need to Joshua. Now, Daniel, David, Moses, Joseph, all of them had power to conquer an enemy. But now, G Oh, I'm glad it got quiet. Listen to what I'm about to say. But Jesus, he came because Jesus had to conquer the one that they could not conquer. There's one shouting account. I SAID JESUS CAME TO CONQUER WHAT THEY COULDN'T CONQUER. THEY HAD THEIR BATTLES. YES, THEY WON THEIR BATTLES. BUT JESUS DON'T JUST WIN THE BATTLE, BROTHERS AND SISTERS. HE WINS THE WAR. We win. THEY KILLED HIM ON CALVARY. THERE HE WAS. THEY KILLED HIM ON CALVARY AND HIS SOUL DESCENDS DOWN INTO HELL. AND HE GOES DOWN THERE AND HE TURNS THE KEY ON HELL and says, "Listen," he comes down there and he unlocks this place. And the prophet said he absolutely took it over. &gt;&gt; SATAN COULD NOT STAND IT. HE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR. LET ME IN. I'M HERE TO TAKE OVER. GIVE ME THOSE KEYS. WHAT WERE THOSE KEYS? THOSE KEYS WERE THE KEYS TO YOUR GATE AND YOUR GATE AND YOUR GATE AND YOUR GATE AND YOUR GATE. THAT'S WHOSE KEYS HE TOOK AND SAYS, "I'M ABOUT TO FREE ALL OF MY CHILDREN." And when we are dead in Christ as Abraham's seed, we're more than conquerors. I said, "We're more than conquerors through him who conquered everything for us." &gt;&gt; No reason. No reason for us to have to overcome anything. What y'all get so quiet for? He said, "It's no reason for us to have to overcome anything because it's already conquered. &gt;&gt; It's already conquered. He's already went. The last enemy, the last sickness, the last death, the temptation, all those things are put under his feet on Calvary. And we are the seed of Abraham. And he said, being dead in Christ, WE ARE ABRAHAM'S SEED, MARCHING on to victory, to victory, &gt;&gt; to victory. WE DON'T STOP AT ONE. I'm here to win everything that God has promised me. I'M NOT PLANNING ON GIVING THE DEVIL ONE THING OF MINE BECAUSE THIS IS MY DOMAIN. THIS WORLD THAT GOD HAS GIVEN ME. It's where I dwell &gt;&gt; and it's where THE PRESENCE OF GOD dwells &gt;&gt; right here. &gt;&gt; Stay away Satan. This property is posted. Death has no gate for us. Brothers and sisters, I'll never die. &gt;&gt; How many is in Christ this morning? &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NEVER DIE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; I will NEVER DIE BECAUSE I'M ALREADY DEAD. MY LIFE, I'm buried. My life is hid in God through Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, do I sometimes get myself in the way? Do I get my life in the way? Yes, sir. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; But when I think about it, I thank God, LET ME START OVER this morning. &gt;&gt; Now I lay me down to sleep. Forgive me for the mistakes I make. &gt;&gt; And when my feet hit the floor, Lord, give me a new start &gt;&gt; every morning. But our life is hid in Christ, sealed by the Holy Ghost. And the Bible says, "The devil couldn't get me if he had to. IF HE HAD TO, IF THE DE SO SOUL, IF THE DEVIL'S HELL DEMANDED AND RELIED UPON getting you, HE CANNOT GET you off limits. I want you to notice the power in the name of Jesus this morning. Luke chapter 1, I'm going to read a little bit to you here. Luke chapter 1. And the angel came unto her and said, "Hail, thou art highly favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among the women. This is Luke chapter 1. If you brothers want to pull it up. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, said, cast in her mind, what manner of salutation should this be? The angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary, for thou has found favor with God. Isn't that a good place to be? &gt;&gt; Fear not, bride, you have found favor with God. Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and his name shall be called Jesus. And then Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing that I know not a man? And the angel said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. Skip down to verse 36 there. And behold thy cousin Elizabeth. We ever read this in a Christmas message? Not usually. Behold thy cousin Elizabeth. She also hath conceived a son in her old age and is about the sixth month with her who is called barren. And this is an astounding statement. The next verse 37. Put that up there, brothers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your cousin Elizabeth is going to conceive a child. She's six months conceived and but and she's called barren. But for WITH GOD NOTHING SHALL BE IMPOSSIBLE. And she rose in the city and and left haste and left into the city of Judah and entered into Zachariah's house and saluted Elizabeth. And it came to pass when Elizabeth heard the salutations of Mary, the babe leapt &gt;&gt; in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Huh? Mary Mary was kind of working for UPS at that time. She's delivering Christmas packages. &gt;&gt; Hey, Elizabeth. You know, Prophet says she was going down through there. She was going there and and the and the and the angel the Gabriel had told her exactly what was going to happen and and that she would call his name Jesus. and and and and you're going to go see your your your cousin Elizabeth and everything's going to all this stuff is going to transpire. Now, Elizabeth had been praying to God. Elizabeth had been praying to God that God would give them a baby. She was barren, 60 years old, and and Zechar Zacharias was Zachchariah was in his 70s, no children, and she'd been praying. Now, Zachariah goes up into the church to carry out his mintorial duties. And while he's up there, HE GOES OVER AND HE LOOKS AND he sees the angel Gabriel standing in the corner. And Gabriel then confirms to him, "Hey, listen to me. You're going to have a child." &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want you to listen to what he says here. While he was in there burning incense, he stood there standing at the right hand of the altar. There stood Gabriel, the archangel. Now his next statement says, "Live right, do right. Angels are still living. God has them at his command." &gt;&gt; There stood a Gabriel the archangel and told him what was going to happen. And after this, he goes down there and now Elizabeth, as soon as she found out that she was going to be mother. So he goes home and he tells Elizabeth, "Now listen to what happened at the church. When I was up there doing MY DUTIES, I SAW AN ANGEL, GABRIEL, AND he says, "We're going to have a child." And the prophet said she she doubted. No, no, don't get the story mixed up. She didn't doubt. He said SHE WENT AND HID HERSELF AWAY. And she began to knit little booties. And she went in there and she began to knit these little booties getting ready for this little fella. She began to knit a little blanket and getting all these things together because she knew she was going to be a mother. But she began to worry about something. How many of you's ever had a promise from God and and it's all good and it sounds good and you know it's going to happen, but all of a sudden it's not lining up and you begin to worry. You know it was God that told you. YOU KNOW IT WAS GOD THAT YOU HAD YOUR FAITH IN. BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THINGS are not lining up and this is not going as you planned in your mind. Remember he don't think our thoughts. We don't think his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Keep ourselves out of the way. &gt;&gt; But here it was Elizabeth now. SHE DONE GETTING EVERYTHING READY. BUT SHE BEGAN TO WORRY because it was about six months and that baby had not yet moved. &gt;&gt; Six months. Any of you mothers or expected mothers know that that's not normal. &gt;&gt; Six months. There should be some moving. There should be some thrashing. There should be some life in there. So now she's sitting there and and and she pulls back her curtain and sees this sees this little girl running, this little 18year-old girl running towards her house. And she's looking trying to figure out who is this? I should know her. Well, look well, look at here's Look at THAT. THIS IS THAT'S MARY. LOOK AT HER. I know who this is. Mary, come on IN HERE. COME ON IN, MARY. WHAT HAVE YOU got to tell what's going on? How are you doing? Oh, I'm just fine. How are you, Elizabeth? I'm fine. I'm feeling wonderful. And Mary says, "I'm so happy to hear the news that you're going to have a child." Do you ever wonder how Elizabeth thought that Mary knew that? Well, the Gabriel, the archangel, told Mary, "Go see Elizabeth. She's going to have a child." &gt;&gt; That's who the messenger was. &gt;&gt; And I'm so happy to hear that you're going to have a child. And she said, "That's right. I'm so happy. I am so happy. And and she said, "Mary, or she said she said," Elizabeth, do you know that I'm going to have a child, too? &gt;&gt; Well, you and Joseph got married. Congratulations. Well, not exactly. &gt;&gt; Not exactly. I'm not married at all, but I am going to be a mother. I don't understand this Mary. I don't understand WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME? WELL, YOU SEE THE an angel named Gabriel come down and told me that I was GOING TO BE OVERSHADOWED WITH A CHILD OF THE HOLY GHOST. And he said THAT YOU WHO WAS ONCE BARREN THROUGH GOD WHERE ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE are now going to have a child. &gt;&gt; So don't worry. &gt;&gt; God's got it all under control. You mean you mean Mary? You mean Gabriel come and told YOU THAT? YES. GABRIEL COME AND TOLD ME THAT AND HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT I'M GOING TO CALL HIS NAME JESUS. AND THAT BABY JUMPED. THAT BABY LEAPT FOR JOY. A BABY THAT WAS ONCE DEAD IN THE WOMB OF ITS MOTHER AT THE NAME of Jesus begins to roll. It begins to thrash. IT BEGINS TO PRAISE the Lord for what God is doing in its life. As soon as she said Jesus, that little John come to life. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the the enlightenment on Elizabeth's face? &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW SHE MUST HAVE FELT WHEN AND WHEN THAT NAME JESUS was spoken? The name of Jesus Christ that brought the life into that dead baby. The first time his name, brothers and sisters, was ever spoken through human lips and a dead baby comes to life. Not only that, but the Bible says that that baby in the womb of Elizabeth's womb would be full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, what a gift. Full of the Holy Ghost. SO IT THAT SAME name Jesus if it would heal and deliver a dead baby in the womb that's the same name WHEN WE SAY JESUS I'm sick &gt;&gt; and that's THE SAME NAME JESUS I'M SICK AND IT GIVES HEALING IT'S THE SAME NAME WHEN WE SAY JESUS I'M OPPRESSED AND HE frees the oppressed IT'S THE SAME NAME that when you're under bondage when you need deliverance in your life WHEN YOU'VE GOT HABITS THAT YOU CAN'T OVERCOME. It's the same name. WHEN YOU SAY JESUS, HE moves on the scene. And you ought to come to life when you hear that name, Jesus. You ought to stand to your feet and praise God for what he's done in your life. &gt;&gt; HE'S WORTHY OF OUR PRAISE. HE'S WORTHY OF ALL GRACE. HE'S WORTHY OF ALL DOMINION. HE'S WORTHY OF HONOR. HE'S WORTHY of glory. Why? Because it's Jesus. It's Jesus. It's Jesus. &gt;&gt; Therefore, the Lord said unim, I'm going to give you a sign. The virgin shall conceive. Now the name Emanuel would become a a promise. It would become a promise. It becomes a promise that Jesus is going to establish himself as an everpresent help in a time of trouble. &gt;&gt; What a gift. What was it? It was Christ reconciling himself to the world. Brother Ber mentioned it. He probably didn't know why he was mentioning it, but it was in my notes. Either that or he was at my in my house this morning looking over my shoulder. But Jesus became a man to overcome everything that we couldn't. &gt;&gt; Think about this. Down on his road DOWN THERE TO MEET LAZARUS. LAZARUS LAYING DOWN THERE DEAD IN A TOMB. And he was looked like that that the human being part had been conquered. And there was his flesh, the human the flesh, God, the man walking down there. And he begins to weep and he begins to cry and he begins to hurt because OF WHAT HE KNOWS HAS happened to Lazarus. This was his friend. and he's looking down there and he looks down THERE AND HE'S CRYING AND WEEPING. But then he throws his shoulders back. &gt;&gt; The tears dry up. &gt;&gt; The crying stops. The weeping. The emotions are put aside. And he says, "Lazareth, LAZARUS, COME FORTH." BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THAT WAS MORE THAN A MAN. THAT WAS GOD ON THE SCENE. THAT WAS GOD DELIVERING HIS WORD. THAT WAS GOD DELIVERING A MESSAGE for that hour. When he come down out of the mountains and he come down that night and he was hungry. He didn't have nothing to eat. And there was a fig tree with no figs on it. And he looks down there and he's hungry. He's hungrying as a man and says, "Man, I got to have something to eat." That was a man. But when HE TOOK THOSE FIVE FISHES AND those loaves and those fishes and he began to break it and he BEGAN TO TAKE THOSE FIVE BISCUITS and those two fishes and HE BEGINS TO FEED 5,000 MEN, 5,000 WOMEN AND their children, that was more than a man. &gt;&gt; That was not him hungering as a man, BUT THAT WAS GOD IN THE MAN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. Prophet said one day he was laying on that boat that night and the storm was so bad and so torturous. He was just worn plum out from preaching. HE WAS WORN PLUM out from ministering to the people. AND HE WAS BACK THERE ASLEEP in the back of the vessel. AND HE SAID THERE WAS 10,000 DEVILS ON THE SEA THAT SWORE THEY WERE GOING TO DROWN HIM. &gt;&gt; He's tired. He's weary. He's resting. That was a man. But when he put his foot up on the brow of that boat, no more tiredness, no more weariness, no more, it was all business. THEN WHEN HE PUT HIS foot up on the brow of that boat and he SAID, "PEACE BE STILL." THAT WAS MORE THAN A MAN. THAT WAS GOD ON the scene, brothers and sisters. When a woman come to him 12 years with a blood issue, she comes to him and she touches the hem of his garment. I don't have the detailed notes here, but we'll share what we know. We'll share it with you. In in Hebrew Jewish, the religion there, the the hem of the garment is considered the wings. The Bible says there's healing in the wings. So Jesus has his his his mock his smock on, whatever you want to call it, the robe. And at the bottom of his robe is a little fringes. And this woman WHO'S HAD A BLOOD ISSUE FOR 12 YEARS, BATTLING HER WAY THROUGH THE CROWD, SHE SAYS, "IF I COULD JUST GET TO THAT MAN, THAT'S GOT HEALING in his wings, AND IF I COULD JUST TOUCH THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT, I KNOW MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AFTER 12 YEARS OF A BLOOD ISSUE." GONE. Here's Jarius's daughter. We're trying to find a place to get off here. Here's Jarius's daughter. Jarius's daughter's laying there. She's been sick. AND HE'S GOT SO MUCH confidence in Jesus. HE'S HEARD ALL ABOUT this man named Jesus. AND HE'S GOT so much confidence. AND NOW JARIUS'S daughter is sitting there. And her heart begins to fail. And she passes on over. and she's passed over laying there dead. Jesus is on his way and the messenger comes to Jarius and says, "Jarius, I hate to have to tell you this, but your daughter's already dead. There's no need for you to trouble the master." Jarius's heart falls. He begins to weep. He begins to cry. And he turns around and he looks into those dark eyes of Jesus. And Jesus says, "Did I not say, "Fear not." Did I not say, "Fear not, for thou shalt see the glory of God." &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have to walk through the gate. Did I not say that you're going to see the glory of God? And Jesus then walks into the death chamber. It was not a hospital anymore. Now we're in a morg. And he walks into the death chamber where those people were in there. And he says, "She's not dead. She's just asleep." They said, "Look at listen to this guy. Listen to this guy. In other words, this guy's crazy. He has not been to medical school. He's not a doctor. HE HAS NOT STUDIED. HE DOES NOT KNOW. WE SAW the very life leave out of her. She's not breathed in ours. BUT LITTLE DO THEY KNOW THAT THEY WERE STANDING IN THE PRESENCE of the great physician himself, the one and only healer of all diseases, all afflictions. And he looks over there and HE SAYS, "GET THEM OUT OF HERE." YOU SEE, HE didn't have room for doubt to be around me. &gt;&gt; Get them out of here. &gt;&gt; When I'm going through something, I don't have room for doubt to be around me. If you're going to come telling me how bad my MY SITUATION IS, STAY AWAY. &gt;&gt; I don't want you around me. But if you're going to come and TELL ME HOW GOOD MY GOD is and HOW BIG OF A HEALER HE IS, HOW MANY TIMES HE'S DELIVERED, if you're going to tell ME THOSE KINDS OF THINGS, COME TALK TO ME. COME SING ME A SONG AND WE'LL PRAISE GOD TOGETHER. Get him out OF HERE. AND HE PUT HIM OUT OF THE ROOM and he says, "Now there he was possessed of the power not of man but of the Holy Ghost." You see, Jesus was a man, but he was more than a man. At the time when all earthly things, all the man's ideas, they're going to fail. All these things are falling around. He looks down at this little girl, this little damsel there that's taken her breath hour, her last breath hours before, and he says, "Tella, little girl, also interpreted as little lamb, get up. Arise. Arise. That wasn't a man. He was speaking in a foreign tongue. He was speaking in another language. He was speaking under the uncction of the Holy Ghost. NOT AS A MAN NO MORE, BUT TO LITHIA. GET UP, LITTLE GIRL. Get up. COME BACK TO LIFE. COME BACK FROM WHERE THE SPIRIT LAND THAT YOU'RE FROM. He said, you're not laying there dead anymore. And that girl, I said, that girl stood to her feet. &gt;&gt; The girl that was once dead stood to her feet and lived again. Brothers and sisters, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR SITUATION IS. IF WE'LL ALLOW GOD TO COME INTO OUR LIVES, YOU SAY, "I'M COLD. I'M BACKSLID. I'M INFORMAL." LET GOD COME IN AND SEE IF YOU DON'T live again. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Let's stand to our feet. I got to quit. Our Emmanuel be with us forever. He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you. I'll be with you. I'll be even in you to the end of the world. That's our God. You know, there are seven compound names of Jehovah. Jehovah Gyra, my provider. Jehovah Rafa, the Lord who heals. Jehovah Ni, the Lord my banner. Jehovah Shalom, the Lord my peace. Jehovah Rah, the Lord my shepherd. Jehovah Sakanu, the Lord our righteousness. Jehovah Shyama, the Lord is there. Brothers and sisters, that was Old Testament. We've got the New Testament. We've got God our healer. God our deliverer. God our for our forgiver. God our burden bearer. God the restorer of our families. The God the restorer of our homes. The God restorer of our bodies.

He's in the house. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Bear with us. We're trying to get things figured out here. You know this song. This is talking about Jarius's daughter. But let's don't place Jarius's daughter. Let's place us there. He's in this house. &gt;&gt; He's not in a manger. He's not somewhere in a manger, but he's in this house. &gt;&gt; He's in this church. He's here to deliver. He's here to give what? Everything that you have need of. &gt;&gt; You believe it? Let's sing this. Little girl was lying there. People all were weeping. They just laughed at Jesus and said, "She's only sleeping." As he took her by the hand, she began to live again. Some begin to praise the Lord. Some begin to say, "He's in the house. Death has to flee. Now there is life where darkness used to be. Now there is hope. There's no more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his name. He's in the house. We were like that little girl, dead in all our sins. till Jesus touched this heart of mine and gave me life again. I am just a house of clay. Ever since that blessed day, there's a light that shines on me for all the world to see. He's in the house. Death has to flee. Hallelujah.
