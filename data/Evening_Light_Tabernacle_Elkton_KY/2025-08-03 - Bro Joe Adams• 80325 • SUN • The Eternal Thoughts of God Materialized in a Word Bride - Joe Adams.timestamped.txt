[21:19] people would get pretty excited about
[21:20] that, right? How many believe we're
[21:22] expecting Jesus to come by? Amen. So,
[21:25] let's stand and give the Lord a hand.
[21:27] Amen. Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus."
[21:29] Praise the Lord.
[21:33] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm going to
[21:36] Who's Brother Troy? You got it? You're
[21:38] you doing it? Okay. We're going to open
[21:39] up in prayer. Let's just bow our heads.
[21:41] Father, we come before you, Lord Jesus,
[21:43] with hearts of expectation, Lord, for
[21:45] what you have. Our ears are wide open,
[21:48] Lord Jesus, to what you'll have to say
[21:50] to us through your minister, Brother Joe
[21:53] Adams, this morning, Father. We ask,
[21:55] God, that you'll look upon every heart,
[21:57] upon every need, Lord, and come and do
[21:59] what you always do, Lord Jesus, and meet
[22:02] the expectation of the people, Lord, the
[22:04] faith of the people, Lord. May we have
[22:06] faith in you this morning. May there not
[22:08] be any weakness in faith, Father, in
[22:11] this group of people this morning as we
[22:13] all assemble ourselves together, Lord.
[22:15] Thanking you, Lord Jesus, for bringing
[22:18] us to this month of August now, Lord
[22:20] Jesus. And we ask, God, that as we start
[22:22] this month, Father, we just want to
[22:24] dedicate it to you. And ask God, that
[22:26] you would help us to reflect you,
[22:28] Father, in every aspect and every every
[22:30] part of this month, Lord. And we ask,
[22:32] God, that you'd just come in a special
[22:33] way, Lord. And also for brother Glenn
[22:35] this morning, Lord, who's been diagnosed
[22:37] with COVID, Lord, and he's got to be
[22:39] separated from people for about 10 days.
[22:41] We ask God, we rebuke that devil of
[22:44] COVID in the name of Jesus Christ. And
[22:47] we cast him away from him and ask for
[22:49] health and strength for our brother,
[22:51] Lord. And Lord, we just thank you for
[22:53] this time that we have together. We look
[22:54] forward to hearing your word to reading
[22:56] of your word this morning and then
[22:58] worshiping you in spirit and in truth
[23:00] Lord tenderizing our hearts and then
[23:03] Lord to let the word Father come so to
[23:05] speak and fall on good tender ground
[23:08] Lord Jesus so that it'll bring forth a
[23:10] hundfold Lord we ask God that you'll
[23:12] bless this day in Jesus' name and

[51:07] Does he understand?
[51:11] Sometimes I question if he's aable.
[51:16] Can he resue? Can he save me again and
[51:21] again?
[51:23] When I look back,

[52:03] I'm forgotten and I fallen too far from
[52:08] his hands. But I know what kind of God
[52:12] he is and I'm trusting in his promises.
[52:16] I'm believing and I'm singing. Yes, he
[52:21] can.

[1:01:45] religions where we say, "Well, that
[1:01:47] brother needed that or that sister

[1:01:51] heart of a sponge to reabsorb what God
[1:01:53] has for us this morning. As we invite
[1:01:55] our precious beloved brother and friend,

[1:04:11] Amen. Don't you love him this morning?
[1:04:14] He's worthy to be praised. Let's just go
[1:04:15] to him in prayer. Father, we bow our
[1:04:18] hearts and our heads to you this
[1:04:20] morning, Father, and want to thank you
[1:04:22] for your many blessings to us, Lord.
[1:04:24] Thank you for allowing us to gather once
[1:04:26] again, Lord, in your house. Lord, we
[1:04:28] know that this house is just four walls,
[1:04:30] but Father, your people is the church.
[1:04:33] And Lord, we assemble togethers today to
[1:04:36] allow your word to permeate our hearts,
[1:04:38] our lives. We invite you, Lord, to come
[1:04:41] by your word and speak to us. Lord, you
[1:04:44] see us. You see the trials we've been
[1:04:46] through, the situations of life that we
[1:04:48] face, God. You've seen us on the
[1:04:50] mountaintops. Lord, you see us crying in
[1:04:53] the valleys, God. But yet, Lord, you're
[1:04:56] still God. You're still faithful. You're
[1:04:58] still available. And Lord, we as your
[1:05:00] children want to hear from you this
[1:05:02] morning. Pray God you would just come
[1:05:04] and break the bread of life and speak to
[1:05:06] us as only you can. Lord, I just pray
[1:05:09] for every heart, every life that's here
[1:05:11] today. Lord, at the sounding of my
[1:05:13] voice, may you just speak to him, Lord.
[1:05:15] Be with brother Glenn there in the
[1:05:16] hospital. Father, go to him even now.
[1:05:19] Touch him in his body, Lord. And those
[1:05:21] that couldn't be here this morning, God.
[1:05:23] May you just attend to them and to their
[1:05:25] needs in a special way. Father, we be
[1:05:27] careful this morning to give you all the
[1:05:29] honor and the glory for we ask it in
[1:05:31] Jesus name. Amen. If you have your
[1:05:34] Bibles this morning, we're going to
[1:05:35] learn or not learn, we're going to turn
[1:05:37] to Jeremiah 29 and verse 11-14.
[1:05:43] Just happy to be back with you again
[1:05:45] this this morning. This today and for a
[1:05:48] few days this week we'll be here. We
[1:05:51] bring you greetings from brother Tim and
[1:05:52] the saints here at Evenlight Tabernacle.
[1:05:55] Brother Tim says to send his greetings
[1:05:56] and so we're happy to be with you this
[1:05:59] morning. We always look forward to
[1:06:00] coming back to Elton, Kentucky. I'm not
[1:06:03] sure you can understand why, but we have
[1:06:06] a precious little daughter that's here
[1:06:08] and it's always great to come and to
[1:06:10] spend some time with her and we don't
[1:06:12] want to be uh too forward with our
[1:06:15] visitations and we try to limit that,
[1:06:17] but we are happy to come and be a part.
[1:06:20] And as I was telling brother Thomas in
[1:06:21] the back, it's twofold. We get to spend
[1:06:23] time with her. We also get to spend time
[1:06:26] with you. So, we're happy to be here.
[1:06:28] But today I just want to share what the
[1:06:30] Lord has laid on my thought or on my
[1:06:31] heart rather. And this evening, brother
[1:06:34] Tom, if if it's okay, I'd like to kind
[1:06:36] of take the evening service and direct
[1:06:38] it toward the young people. And then
[1:06:39] we'll pick back up on this thought again
[1:06:41] Wednesday night. So you have a purpose
[1:06:43] and a reason for being here Wednesday
[1:06:44] night if you typically don't come on
[1:06:46] Wednesdays. So part two of the thought
[1:06:48] today is going to be us uh we're going
[1:06:51] to Lord willing now we'll we'll speak it
[1:06:53] on Wednesday night so we don't get it
[1:06:54] all today. But I want to kind of direct
[1:06:56] this evening to the young people. I know
[1:06:58] some of you about to go to the TWT camp
[1:07:01] and I just kind of want to send you off
[1:07:02] if I could with you know some uh some
[1:07:04] good word if the Lord permit. But this
[1:07:08] morning I want to speak to you on the
[1:07:10] eternal thoughts of God materialize in a
[1:07:13] word bride. The eternal thoughts of God
[1:07:16] materialize in a word bride. Now, by a
[1:07:19] show of hands, how many of you've been
[1:07:21] saved within the last year?
[1:07:24] Last five years, raise your hand. Last
[1:07:27] five years, you've been saved. You got
[1:07:28] saved. Give your heart to the Lord. Last
[1:07:30] 10 years,
[1:07:33] 15. Keep your hand up, everybody. Keep
[1:07:35] your hand up. 20 years,
[1:07:38] 25,
[1:07:40] 30. Let's go on the 50 years, 60 years.
[1:07:44] All right. So almost every hand should
[1:07:46] be open or up in the air by now. So now
[1:07:49] as I preach this thought to you today,
[1:07:51] the eternal thoughts of God. Now that
[1:07:53] word eternal means no beginning and no
[1:07:56] end.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; So some of you was in the last 5 years,
[1:07:59] last year, last 10 years, 50 years, but
[1:08:02] to God it always was. So we want to take
[1:08:06] this in Jeremiah 29:1 says, "For I know
[1:08:09] the thoughts that I think toward you,
[1:08:12] sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and
[1:08:14] not of evil, to give you an expected
[1:08:17] end.
[1:08:19] Then shall you call upon me, and you
[1:08:22] shall go and pray unto me, and I will
[1:08:23] hearken unto you, and you shall seek me
[1:08:26] and find me, when you shall search for
[1:08:28] me with all your heart, and I will be
[1:08:30] found of you, sayaeth the Lord, and I
[1:08:32] will turn away your captivity, and I
[1:08:34] will gather you from all the nations,
[1:08:36] and from all the places whether I've
[1:08:38] driven you, sayeth the Lord, and I will
[1:08:40] bring you again into the place whence I
[1:08:43] cause you to be carried away captive.
[1:08:45] God bless you. You can have your seats
[1:08:46] this morning.
[1:08:48] Brother Joe, I want to give you a
[1:08:50] special greeting. Happy birthday.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; You make 60 look good. If that's
[1:08:56] possible,
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; I'm just on your coattail. I'm at 50. I
[1:09:02] just turned 50. So, I think 50 and 60 is
[1:09:04] the new 20 and 30. How about that?
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; I enjoyed those specials for the the
[1:09:10] young ladies that came up and sang that
[1:09:12] song. You know, if God did it then, he
[1:09:14] can do it again for us today. And
[1:09:15] thankfully he gave us one more day.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; You know, he gave us another day to
[1:09:20] serve him, another day to worship him,
[1:09:22] to be to come to the revelation that we
[1:09:25] are the sons and daughters of God. So we
[1:09:28] look here though, I want to kind of
[1:09:29] build this thought because it's going to
[1:09:30] be a two-part series if we can tonight
[1:09:33] or this morning rather and Wednesday
[1:09:35] night. The eternal thoughts of God
[1:09:38] materialize
[1:09:39] in a word bride. And we look here many
[1:09:42] times we think of Jeremiah 29. and I
[1:09:44] know the thoughts that I think of you
[1:09:46] and it's, you know, it's warm and it's
[1:09:48] comforting and it's encouraging. But
[1:09:50] it's deeper than that. It's much more
[1:09:53] than just, you know, a just blanket
[1:09:56] little statement. You know, here God is
[1:09:58] speaking to Jeremiah. Jeremiah being
[1:10:00] what we call the weeping prophet. And,
[1:10:02] you know, Jeremiah, I'm actually going
[1:10:04] through the book of Jeremiah now. And we
[1:10:06] find God becomes personal to Jeremiah.
[1:10:08] He says, "I know the thoughts that I
[1:10:10] think toward you." you know, thoughts of
[1:10:12] peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:10:16] expected end. And you take this word
[1:10:18] thought here and you look it up in the
[1:10:19] Webster's dictionary and it means an
[1:10:22] individual act or product of thinking, a
[1:10:25] developed intention or plan, an
[1:10:27] intellectual product or the organiz
[1:10:30] organized views and principles of a
[1:10:32] period, a place, a group or an
[1:10:35] individual. So we look at it and we
[1:10:37] think well it's just an idea. But when
[1:10:40] you take it and you look at it in the
[1:10:42] Bible and the terminology and you trace
[1:10:44] the Greek word back, it actually means a
[1:10:47] purpose and a plan.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; So we can look at what God is telling
[1:10:52] Jeremiah. I know the plans
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; that I have for you.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; I know the purpose
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; that I have for you. And can I tell you
[1:11:02] this morning, some of you raised your
[1:11:04] hand 5 years, 10 years, 11 years, 25
[1:11:07] years, 30 years, 50 years. But yet, God
[1:11:09] has always had a purpose. God has always
[1:11:12] had a plan for you and for your life and
[1:11:16] for bringing you here today.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; I know the thoughts. I know the purpose.
[1:11:22] I know the plans. You may have not known
[1:11:25] the purpose. You may have struggled with
[1:11:27] the plans of God, but God has always
[1:11:29] known why he brought you to this hour,
[1:11:32] to this age, to this church, for this
[1:11:35] purpose, for this reason. Because God is
[1:11:38] going to manifest. God is going to
[1:11:40] materialize the very thoughts that he
[1:11:42] had of you way before you gave your
[1:11:45] heart to the Lord.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; See, you were in God's thinking.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; So, the purpose and plans of God Yes.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Originated
[1:11:58] in the very mind of God.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; How many builders do we have here this
[1:12:03] morning? People that build. Man, y'all
[1:12:06] scared this morning. Two of us. Tommy.
[1:12:10] All right. We got Okay, we got a That's
[1:12:11] okay. Put your hands up high. My
[1:12:13] goodness. I ain't going to call you out.
[1:12:16] But as you begin to build something,
[1:12:19] it starts right here. That's right.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; It's a thought in your mind. You begin
[1:12:24] to to draw it out and then you begin to
[1:12:26] engineer it and all these things are
[1:12:29] intricate details. It all lays in your
[1:12:32] mind and you begin to put it on paper
[1:12:34] and it becomes a blueprint and then that
[1:12:37] blueprint becomes materialized and it
[1:12:39] becomes walls and it becomes this and it
[1:12:41] becomes flooring and it becomes the the
[1:12:43] paint, the color, the this, the that,
[1:12:45] all of it. But it all started at one
[1:12:48] place. It was in the builder's mind. And
[1:12:51] can I tell you this morning, you started
[1:12:54] in the builder's mind this morning.
[1:12:56] Before there ever was a molecule, before
[1:12:59] there ever was an atom, you were in the
[1:13:01] very mind of God, in the very thoughts
[1:13:03] of God. God had you in his thinking.
[1:13:07] God had you in his plan. God has a
[1:13:10] purpose for you this morning.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; You just didn't happen to be.
[1:13:19] No, God doesn't operate that way. God
[1:13:21] doesn't make mistakes.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; So, let me just go ahead and tell you,
[1:13:25] you may have been struggling with your
[1:13:27] existence. You are not a mistake this
[1:13:30] morning.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; God purposed you for this hour. God
[1:13:34] placed you in this hour. God planned for
[1:13:36] you in this hour.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; And think about Genesis. When we look at
[1:13:42] Genesis, we think about Genesis 1 being
[1:13:45] the creation chapter
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; because the Bible tells us that the
[1:13:52] world or the earth was without form or
[1:13:55] void
[1:13:56] and God be to move on the face of the
[1:14:00] earth. So we find here in Genesis verse
[1:14:04] one or chapter 1 verse3, you don't have
[1:14:06] to turn there. Light was created.
[1:14:10] Then in verse six, the firminant was
[1:14:12] created. Then in verse 9, the waters
[1:14:14] were created. Then in verse 10, the land
[1:14:16] was created. Grass was created. In 11,
[1:14:19] animal life was created. Botney life was
[1:14:22] created. All this was created in Genesis
[1:14:25] 1.
[1:14:27] See, God continued to evolve in his
[1:14:31] creation.
[1:14:33] But you know the very last thing that
[1:14:35] God created
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; was man.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Genesis 1 and verse 26 the Bible tells
[1:14:44] us and God said let us make man in our
[1:14:47] image and after our likeness and let
[1:14:49] them have dominion over the fish and
[1:14:52] over the sea and over the fowl of the
[1:14:53] air and over the cattle and over all the
[1:14:55] earth and over every creeping thing that
[1:14:58] creepeth upon the earth. Notice God had
[1:15:00] already created everything else. And now
[1:15:02] he creates man and he sets man to have
[1:15:05] dominion over all of the other things
[1:15:07] that he had created.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Then we find here in verse 27, so God
[1:15:14] created man in his own image.
[1:15:18] God already had you in his thoughts. He
[1:15:21] created a man in his own image. In the
[1:15:23] image of God created he him. Male and
[1:15:26] female created he them. In Genesis 2 and
[1:15:28] verse 7, and the Lord God formed man of
[1:15:32] the dust of the ground, and he breathed
[1:15:33] into his nostrils the breath of life,
[1:15:36] and man became a living soul.
[1:15:40] So the earth we find in Genesis was
[1:15:42] without form and void. And God be to
[1:15:46] create otherwise, let me say it like
[1:15:48] this, God be to express his thoughts.
[1:15:52] Yeah.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; My goodness. I got a skinny jacket on
[1:15:58] this morning.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank you for help.
[1:16:05] My That's bad when you got T-Rex arms
[1:16:08] and you can't get a skinny jacket off.
[1:16:13] Hallelujah. But we find here in Genesis,
[1:16:16] God begin to express his thoughts in the
[1:16:20] act of creating.
[1:16:23] So he would speak, let there be and what
[1:16:26] he spoke became or as we could say begin
[1:16:30] to materialize.
[1:16:31] But before he spoke it, it had to be a
[1:16:34] thought. And the thoughts that God had,
[1:16:39] the thoughts that he had, notice, God
[1:16:41] knew this hour.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:44] And God be to express this hour in
[1:16:47] Genesis.
[1:16:49] All the way back in Genesis, he be to
[1:16:52] formulate and begin to express himself
[1:16:56] through a word that he knew that in the
[1:16:59] very beginning when he said, "Let us
[1:17:01] create man in our image." He was going
[1:17:03] to have a bride in Leodosa.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; He was going to have a people that were
[1:17:07] going to be the very image of God.
[1:17:11] They were going to be the very word
[1:17:13] materialized. And many times we find
[1:17:16] here, let's just go back and we look in
[1:17:17] Isaiah 55 just to kind of give you some
[1:17:20] assurance. The Bible tells us, "So shall
[1:17:22] my word be that goeth forth out of my
[1:17:23] mouth. It shall not return unto me void,
[1:17:26] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:17:28] please, and it shall prosper in the
[1:17:30] thing wherewith I send it." So the word
[1:17:32] voider means ineffectual. So we
[1:17:34] understand that the word of God once God
[1:17:37] speaks his word it will not return to
[1:17:40] him ineffectual but it will accomplish
[1:17:43] and the word accomplished means to bring
[1:17:45] forth and not only brother Thomas will
[1:17:47] it bring forth but God added an
[1:17:49] adjective to it he said it will prosper
[1:17:53] otherwise it will multiply it will be
[1:17:56] successful it will be profitable God
[1:17:58] just don't bring something God brings it
[1:18:01] in abundance God brings it with success
[1:18:03] God brings it with a knowing that it's
[1:18:05] going to manifest and materialize in
[1:18:08] exactly what he declared it would be.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; And brother B will tell us and hear you
[1:18:14] him. No matter how long it takes to
[1:18:17] materialize, time doesn't mean nothing
[1:18:19] to God.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Now time means something to you.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Time means something to us. Some of you
[1:18:26] that's here today that are married,
[1:18:28] maybe just got newly married and you
[1:18:31] know five years ago you're like, "Lord,
[1:18:32] please don't come. Let me get married
[1:18:34] first.
[1:18:37] And some of you are probably going,
[1:18:38] "Lord, please don't come. I want to get
[1:18:40] married."
[1:18:42] Come on, church.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; All right, young man.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I got me uh I got Gideon. I got
[1:18:50] Paul. I got Daniel. And I don't know who
[1:18:52] you are cuz you're not a hobb.
[1:18:55] Gersam. That's right. Yeah.
[1:18:58] But I promise there's something inside
[1:19:00] of you like, "Lord, please don't come
[1:19:01] yet." I want to get married.
[1:19:05] Hey, I was there.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Tommy, were you there?
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; All right, good.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; That's That's the right answer. But time
[1:19:17] doesn't mean anything to God. We We get
[1:19:20] bound by time. We get bound by
[1:19:23] circumstances. Notice God told Abraham,
[1:19:25] "Abraham, you're going to have a son."
[1:19:27] And 25 years went by. Time didn't mean
[1:19:31] nothing to God. It was just a few
[1:19:32] seconds to God. But nevertheless,
[1:19:35] Abraham staggered not at the promises of
[1:19:37] God. And that child arrived just like
[1:19:40] God said it would because it was a
[1:19:42] thought in the mind of God. And the word
[1:19:45] has already been spoken. And the word
[1:19:47] cannot return void. And so God spoke it
[1:19:49] to Abraham just the same as God speaking
[1:19:52] to you that there will be a rapture.
[1:19:54] That means somebody in this room this
[1:19:56] morning will take a body change. We'll
[1:19:58] take a rapture. while the word's been
[1:20:00] spoken, church, and it will materialize
[1:20:03] over it. God had already saw you coming
[1:20:07] and God's already saw you raptured.
[1:20:10] [Applause]
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Woo! I feel like preaching this morning.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now all we are today is a
[1:20:18] display of his attributes."
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:20:24] this is God as his own interpreter in
[1:20:26] case you need it after 63. I know some
[1:20:28] of us don't like anything prior to 63.
[1:20:31] He was a prophet all the way from 49 to
[1:20:34] 65.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Don't get hung up on the dates.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; But all we are today is a display of his
[1:20:41] attributes in God first. He was not even
[1:20:43] God. What?
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; You mean God wasn't God? God wasn't God
[1:20:49] always.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; See, God is an object of worship,
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; brother Troy. And there was nothing to
[1:20:56] worship this god. So what is his first
[1:21:00] act? Because he had it in his thinking.
[1:21:03] His first act was to create and he
[1:21:05] created angels.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Now angels came and they would begin to
[1:21:10] worship him and cry holy, holy, holy
[1:21:12] unto the Lord. That's all that they
[1:21:14] could do was to worship God. But God
[1:21:17] wanted more than just worship.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Joe, God wanted to be loved.
[1:21:24] God wanted to express himself in love
[1:21:27] because God is love. And God not only
[1:21:30] wanted to express himself in love, he
[1:21:32] wanted to be loved in return just like
[1:21:35] you and your wife.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; You better love her and you better
[1:21:40] expect her to love you back or that's
[1:21:43] not going to be a happy marriage.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; But listen what he says. He says now he
[1:21:49] wasn't God because the word English word
[1:21:50] God means an object of worship and there
[1:21:52] was nothing to worship him. So he was
[1:21:55] the eternal one the main fountain of all
[1:21:58] intelligence and in this fountain of all
[1:22:01] intelligence there was not an atom a
[1:22:03] molecule or nothing light nowhere star
[1:22:06] moon nothing else. He said, "God, what
[1:22:09] we know as God, the great spirit that
[1:22:11] was eternal, never did begin, never did
[1:22:14] end. And he was there
[1:22:17] before the molecule, before the atom,
[1:22:19] before anything, God was there. And in
[1:22:22] him was attributes.
[1:22:24] It was attributes to be God. Then his
[1:22:26] attributes to be a father, attributes to
[1:22:28] be a son, attributes to be a savior,
[1:22:31] attributes to be a healer." All these
[1:22:34] attributes was in him. And now he says,
[1:22:36] "And these things that that has unfolded
[1:22:39] since then are just the attributes being
[1:22:41] made manifest."
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Then you jump over into God in his own
[1:22:48] interpret. He goes a little bit further
[1:22:49] and this is very next quote or very
[1:22:52] next. Yeah. Very next quote. He says,
[1:22:53] "What I mean attributes was his
[1:22:55] thoughts."
[1:22:58] So in God's thinking, he was going to be
[1:23:00] a healer. In God's thinking, he was
[1:23:03] going to be a savior. in God's thinking,
[1:23:05] he was going to be a husband. So all
[1:23:08] this was in God's thinking. And he says,
[1:23:10] "And a word is a thought expressed." And
[1:23:13] when he said, "Let there be." And there
[1:23:15] was.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; And you Christians were in his thoughts
[1:23:18] before there was a world.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And you Christian, you brother, you
[1:23:24] sister, no matter how young, no matter
[1:23:27] how old you were, listen to what he
[1:23:29] says. You were in God's thoughts
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; before there was a world.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; So, put the devil in check.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; He's come against you all week telling
[1:23:41] you you're not going to make it, telling
[1:23:42] you you can't have it, telling you it
[1:23:44] ain't for you. You was already in the
[1:23:46] thinking in the mind of God.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; And you listen what he says. And you are
[1:23:54] the manifestation of his thinking.
[1:23:56] Before there was even a world, you were
[1:23:59] in Christ. Amen. In God in the
[1:24:01] beginning. That makes you then you see
[1:24:04] his subjects.
[1:24:05] The whole thing is God himself
[1:24:08] materializing himself tangible so he
[1:24:11] could be handled.
[1:24:14] See the eternal thoughts of God. Let me
[1:24:17] ask you, this is what brother says. He
[1:24:20] says, "Let me ask you, are the are the
[1:24:22] thoughts of God eternal?
[1:24:26] Are y'all awake this morning?
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Like good.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just I'm tapping the gas a
[1:24:34] little bit, honey. I ain't going to rev
[1:24:36] it up just too much just yet.
[1:24:38] She's like, don't overwork the people
[1:24:41] all worried about me browbeating y'all.
[1:24:44] He says, now the eternal thoughts of
[1:24:46] God. Let me ask you, are the thoughts of
[1:24:48] God eternal? Amen.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "If you can see this, you will
[1:24:53] see many things."
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; You ever ponder that, brother Tommy? If
[1:24:59] you can see this, see what? See that the
[1:25:02] eternal thoughts of God or the thoughts
[1:25:05] of God are eternal. Because why does he
[1:25:07] say that? Because if you can see where
[1:25:09] your beginning is,
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; then you can see that nothing the devil
[1:25:13] throws at you is going to prosper.
[1:25:16] And if you can see this, you'll see many
[1:25:19] things,
[1:25:22] you can see the opening of the word, you
[1:25:24] can see your place in the book, you can
[1:25:25] see your place in this hour, in this
[1:25:28] age, not going down in defeat, but going
[1:25:30] up in victory. And if you can see that
[1:25:32] the thoughts of God are eternal, let me
[1:25:35] tell you, you see yourself in the lamb's
[1:25:38] book of life. And can't no devil, can't
[1:25:40] no sickness, can't no cancer, can't
[1:25:43] nothing come against you and stop you.
[1:25:45] Why? because you are just as eternal as
[1:25:47] God is eternal. Hallelujah.
[1:25:50] And if you can see this, God's going to
[1:25:52] show you much more than just that.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; God's going to reveal the word to you.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; God's going to show you who you are.
[1:26:00] That the rapture is you. Not an event,
[1:26:03] not a place, not a thing. You are the
[1:26:05] rapture.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; He ain't rapturing uh ELT Elton,
[1:26:09] Kentucky. He's rapturing up people out
[1:26:11] of this church.
[1:26:13] Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; He's raptured a people, a young people
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; and an old people.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; If you can see this, you'll see many
[1:26:27] things.
[1:26:29] He said, "God is unchangeable of both
[1:26:31] essence and behavior." We have studied
[1:26:34] that and proven that already. God is
[1:26:36] infinite in his abilities. So therefore,
[1:26:39] he as God must be omnisient. And if he
[1:26:42] is omnisient, then he is not now
[1:26:44] learning, nor is he taking counsel even
[1:26:46] with himself. Nor is he at any time
[1:26:48] adding to his knowledge. See, God's not
[1:26:52] like us. I'm studying daily adding to
[1:26:57] knowledge or what we would call
[1:26:58] revelation. That's not God. God doesn't
[1:27:00] operate that way. He is a fountain of
[1:27:02] revelation.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; He is the fountain of knowledge. He is a
[1:27:06] the prophet of God would say he's the
[1:27:07] fountain of intelligence.
[1:27:10] So God's not adding. So he says, "Now if
[1:27:13] he can add to his knowledge, then he's
[1:27:15] not omnisient." Best we could say is
[1:27:17] that sometimes he will be, but that is
[1:27:19] not scriptural. See, he is omnisient. He
[1:27:23] has never had a new thought about
[1:27:24] anything. All of his thoughts he has had
[1:27:27] and always will have.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're not a new thought, church.
[1:27:32] The things that you're going through are
[1:27:34] not new. You didn't catch God by
[1:27:35] surprise. God knew it. God brought you
[1:27:38] here for it.
[1:27:40] [Music]
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Notice brother Brown will tell us in the
[1:27:43] church age, this is in the expedition of
[1:27:45] the seven church ages, I believe the
[1:27:47] sman age. He said, "God always had his
[1:27:49] thoughts of Adam." See, Adam as his
[1:27:52] thoughts was yet unexpressed. Then he
[1:27:54] goes into Psalms 139:15. He says, "My
[1:27:58] substance was not hid from from thee
[1:28:01] when I made thee in secret
[1:28:04] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[1:28:05] parts of the earth. thine eyes did not
[1:28:07] see my substance. Yet being unperfect
[1:28:10] and in thy book all my members were
[1:28:12] written which is a continuous were
[1:28:14] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[1:28:16] them. So brother Bam keeps going on. He
[1:28:18] says now that as I said was not written
[1:28:21] about Adam but it gives you an idea and
[1:28:24] a knowledge that the thought was already
[1:28:26] in his mind.
[1:28:28] So God had already thought about Adam
[1:28:31] and the Bible tells us that he and we
[1:28:33] are fearfully and wonderfully made.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; So quit looking in the mirror trying to
[1:28:40] make yourself something else. God
[1:28:43] fearfully and wonderfully made you.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; No matter how tall,
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; all of us tall people say amen. Amen.
[1:28:53] How short. Come on Austin, say amen to
[1:28:56] short. You're probably the tallest
[1:28:58] woman. Well, no. I got Carson back
[1:29:00] there. He's a giant among us. No matter
[1:29:03] how tall, how short, how skinny, how
[1:29:05] big, it doesn't matter. You're fearfully
[1:29:08] and wonderfully made. God made you that
[1:29:10] way. We couldn't all be little Joe
[1:29:13] Adams.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; And the church said, "Amen."
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; John, that was a little bit loud. I
[1:29:19] heard you from here.
[1:29:22] Thank God we're not all carbon copies of
[1:29:24] one another, but God knows what he's
[1:29:27] doing and he placed us all here. He
[1:29:29] says, "So when Adam was formed of the
[1:29:31] dust of the earth and his spiritual
[1:29:34] being created by God, then Adam became
[1:29:37] God's thought expressed and those
[1:29:39] eternal thoughts were now manifested.
[1:29:42] And when you came my brother and when
[1:29:44] you came my sister and God placed you in
[1:29:46] this hour, God birthed you into this h
[1:29:48] while you were the very thoughts of God
[1:29:50] being materialized for a last day church
[1:29:53] for an end time bride. God knew he had a
[1:29:56] word. God knew he spoke it over a
[1:29:58] people. And God knew there was going to
[1:29:59] be somebody that was going to catch hold
[1:30:01] of that word and materialize the very
[1:30:04] thoughts of God.
[1:30:06] A bride without spot. A bride without
[1:30:09] blemish. A church going up in victory.
[1:30:11] not down in the feet.
[1:30:14] That's you, church. Quit looking at your
[1:30:17] failures. Quit looking at your
[1:30:18] shortcomings and look to what the word
[1:30:20] says about you this morning. You've
[1:30:22] already made it.
[1:30:24] [Applause]
[1:30:28] We find Moses, Jeremiah, John the
[1:30:30] Baptist. Each of them, he said they were
[1:30:32] in God's thoughts expressed in its
[1:30:35] season. Then came to Jesus the logos and
[1:30:39] he was the perfect and complete thought
[1:30:42] express and he became known as the word.
[1:30:45] But see it doesn't stop there.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; God had more in store.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; More in store. And I'm going to get into
[1:30:54] it.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Notice the Bible tells us in Ephesians 1
[1:30:59] and verse three. Turn your Bibles there.
[1:31:02] Ephesians 1 and verse three.
[1:31:08] Blessed
[1:31:10] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:31:12] Christ, who has blessed us with all
[1:31:14] spiritual blessings in heavenly places.
[1:31:18] According
[1:31:20] as he has chosen us in him before the
[1:31:22] foundation of the world. So you just
[1:31:25] didn't happen to be.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; You didn't just stumble off the streets.
[1:31:31] You didn't just jump off a buggy
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; for my Menite Amish friends.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; You didn't just jump off a buggy off a
[1:31:38] form. No. God had already had you in his
[1:31:41] thoughts.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Go. I hope you seeing this clear this
[1:31:45] morning. Notice what he says. according
[1:31:48] as he had chosen you when 2025 2024
[1:31:53] 2020. No, before the foundation of the
[1:31:56] world, before there was an atom, before
[1:31:59] there was a molecule, before there was
[1:32:00] anything to worship him, before he was
[1:32:03] God, he chose you in himself.
[1:32:06] Woo! Glory to God this morning. You were
[1:32:09] chosen there. And if you were chosen
[1:32:11] there, you're not going to be defeated
[1:32:12] here.
[1:32:18] chosen in him. It's one thing if you
[1:32:20] were chosen in bad
[1:32:23] and as long as Brad's good, you're good.
[1:32:26] When Brad goes down, you're down. One
[1:32:28] other thing to be chosen in Brother
[1:32:29] Thomas, as long as Brother Thomas is
[1:32:32] good, preaching that word, oh, but not
[1:32:34] saying you're going to get off, but let
[1:32:35] him get off, then you're off.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; But we're not chosen in man. We're not
[1:32:41] chosen in a church. We're not chosen in
[1:32:44] a movement. We are chosen in Christ.
[1:32:48] Before the foundation of the world,
[1:32:51] before you ever took your first breath,
[1:32:53] before you ever committed that first
[1:32:55] sinful act, before anything was ever
[1:32:57] done, God had already chosen you. And I
[1:33:01] told you before and I'll say it again.
[1:33:02] And if God has ever chosen you, Brother
[1:33:04] Joe, he can't unchoose you this morning.
[1:33:07] Cuz God doesn't get a better thought.
[1:33:09] Well, I wished I would have never chose
[1:33:11] him. if I'd have known he was going to
[1:33:13] be a rascal.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; God don't work that way.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody say amen to the word.
[1:33:19] You know it's the truth. Thank God God
[1:33:21] doesn't operate the way we operate.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; He runs a good business.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Notice
[1:33:30] Smyrna Church brother says he had chosen
[1:33:33] us in him Jesus before the foundation of
[1:33:36] the world. That means that we were right
[1:33:38] there with him in the mind and thoughts
[1:33:41] of God before the foundation of the
[1:33:43] world. That gives an eternal quality to
[1:33:47] the elect.
[1:33:49] You can't get away from it.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're having a good
[1:33:53] day, bad day, bad week, bad year, bad
[1:33:55] month, but I'm all here to tell you this
[1:33:57] is great preaching
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; because I'm not preaching my thoughts.
[1:34:01] I'm preaching what a prophet saying. And
[1:34:03] a prophet got it from God.
[1:34:06] He's the mouthpiece. He's the voice of
[1:34:08] God for this age that come down and lay
[1:34:10] us to see him. When the world and and
[1:34:13] our political systems and the age is
[1:34:14] almost completely uh blacked out by
[1:34:17] apostasy, God had came down in this age.
[1:34:20] He interjected himself and he borrowed
[1:34:22] the body of a seventh grade Kentucky to
[1:34:25] speak to a bride to tell her, "You came
[1:34:27] from God. You're going back to God. You
[1:34:29] always was with me. You never was a dog.
[1:34:32] You never was a sheep or a pig turned
[1:34:35] into a sheep. You always was sheep. You
[1:34:37] always was bride. You always was the
[1:34:40] elect of God.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; That's what God sent you for. Send a
[1:34:44] prophet to tell you you always was.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; And if you always was, you always will
[1:34:51] be.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; If you always was, you always will be.
[1:35:03] Notice that gives an eternal quality. No
[1:35:07] beginning and no ending.
[1:35:10] That's what eternal means.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; No beginning, no ending. Then he goes
[1:35:15] on. Now listen, Satan's eating.
[1:35:19] God has attributes in his body. Now, how
[1:35:21] many of us are the body? And the whole
[1:35:23] church should raise our hands
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; cuz he's the head. We're the body.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; All right. The bride is the body. his
[1:35:30] body on earth. So God has attributes in
[1:35:33] his body like you are an attribute of
[1:35:35] your father and you notice you was in
[1:35:38] your grandfather's grandfather's
[1:35:40] grandfather but in that say well said
[1:35:43] take it down like this you and your
[1:35:44] father now you didn't know anything when
[1:35:46] you was in your father he said the germ
[1:35:49] of life comes from the male the male has
[1:35:51] the blood the cell the woman has the egg
[1:35:53] now therefore the blood cell has life in
[1:35:55] it and when you were in your father you
[1:35:56] actually know nothing about it but he
[1:35:59] says but then the Father longed to know
[1:36:02] you. Oh, thank God.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; He longed to know us.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; And with the union and a connection with
[1:36:09] the mother, then you were made known to
[1:36:12] the father. And you are your father's
[1:36:14] attribute. You look like him. You got
[1:36:16] parts like your body parts like him. You
[1:36:19] look like your father. And that's the
[1:36:21] way God was in the beginning. Every son
[1:36:23] of God, every daughter of God was in God
[1:36:26] at the beginning. You don't remember it
[1:36:28] now, but you were there. He knowed it
[1:36:30] and he wanted you to he wanted you to
[1:36:33] come. Notice what he says there so he
[1:36:35] can contact you.
[1:36:38] Listen how a prophet drops in God
[1:36:40] speaking now. He goes he wanted you to
[1:36:43] become so he could contact you speak
[1:36:46] with you love you and shake your hand.
[1:36:52] God wanting to be personal with his
[1:36:54] wife,
[1:36:57] contact you, speak to you and shake your
[1:37:01] hand.
[1:37:03] And as parents,
[1:37:06] we wanted to know when we when we our sp
[1:37:10] our spouses got pregnant.
[1:37:13] Some people don't like to use that word
[1:37:14] in the pulpit, but I mean, good lord,
[1:37:16] how what else we use?
[1:37:20] I mean, we got to be so diplomatic and
[1:37:21] political now, can't even use a word.
[1:37:24] But when when our when we became
[1:37:27] expecting, okay, let's put it like that.
[1:37:30] We wanted to know, well, maybe they're
[1:37:32] going to break that five foot cycle.
[1:37:37] Tammy, did you laugh?
[1:37:41] They going to be taller than five. Look,
[1:37:43] I was so glad Lauren Mary Weston,
[1:37:46] my grandchildren, I'm going to put it on
[1:37:48] record. They have a chance of being
[1:37:49] taller than 4 foot.
[1:37:53] It's called breeding, selective
[1:37:55] breeding.
[1:37:59] But we wonder, will they be tall? Will
[1:38:02] they be dark? Will they be hairless?
[1:38:08] You know, what kind of child am I going
[1:38:10] to have? Are they going to be bucktooth?
[1:38:12] Are they going to be ugly? I worried
[1:38:13] about that. I'm like, God, please don't
[1:38:15] give me ugly kids. I love them, but I
[1:38:17] don't want ugly kids.
[1:38:21] I'm just being honest. Now, y'all don't
[1:38:23] raise your hand cuz you know you I'm
[1:38:24] stepping on your toes, daddies.
[1:38:28] But we wonder what our kids look like.
[1:38:30] How are they going to be? What kind of
[1:38:31] personality are they're going to have?
[1:38:33] What kind of what's going to be their
[1:38:34] makeup? But see, God already knew this
[1:38:37] about you.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love what he says here. Listen
[1:38:42] what he says in question answers 1959.
[1:38:45] He goes, "Oh, isn't it wonderful?" He's
[1:38:46] talking to brother Mike. I don't know
[1:38:48] who this brother Mike is. Isn't it
[1:38:49] wonderful? He loved you. He loved you
[1:38:52] before there was a world. Brother David,
[1:38:55] he knew your nature. Tommy, he knew your
[1:38:58] weaknesses.
[1:38:59] John, he knew your habits. He knowed all
[1:39:03] about you, what you was going to be. And
[1:39:05] then when he looked over all the great
[1:39:07] universe as it was, and he said, "I
[1:39:10] choose you."
[1:39:14] He looked beyond your failures. He
[1:39:16] looked beyond your faults. He looked
[1:39:18] beyond your weaknesses. What was he
[1:39:20] doing? He was looking back in his mind.
[1:39:22] And he says, "I choose them anyway. I
[1:39:24] choose them with all their failures. I
[1:39:26] choose them with all their faults. I
[1:39:28] choose them because they were in my
[1:39:30] thinking to begin with.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; He knew all about you. The good, the
[1:39:38] bad, the ugly. And some of us had more
[1:39:41] ugly than we did good.
[1:39:45] He knowed your nature.
[1:39:47] Now, some of us here this morning, we
[1:39:49] like mountains. I'm a mountain guy.
[1:39:52] Okay. Me and me and me. Me and Tommy.
[1:39:56] Tommy, John. I got me and Tommy John.
[1:39:59] Some of us like beaches.
[1:40:02] And all the ladies.
[1:40:04] Come on, put your hands up. All the
[1:40:07] ladies in Joe.
[1:40:11] Ain't nothing wrong with that, brother
[1:40:12] Joe. I just don't like getting sand in
[1:40:14] places. I don't want
[1:40:16] don't want it. Listen what he says
[1:40:18] though. He says there were some of you.
[1:40:21] He says there were some here when you
[1:40:23] come here. He says because the kindness
[1:40:25] of your heavenly father placed them
[1:40:27] here.
[1:40:29] See, because some men likes mountains,
[1:40:32] some people likes waters,
[1:40:34] some likes deserts, those that are
[1:40:36] stupid. I mean, uh, out of their head.
[1:40:39] Why would you want to live in a desert
[1:40:40] place? I don't know. Don't go telling
[1:40:43] your daddy and him, keep it quiet.
[1:40:48] But you see, some of us like mountains
[1:40:50] and waters and beaches and deserts.
[1:40:53] Notice what he says. You see, you're
[1:40:55] coming. He knew your nature, what you
[1:40:57] would be, so he made it just the way
[1:41:00] that you could enjoy it.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; When God was creating in the book of
[1:41:07] Genesis, God knew the nature that you
[1:41:10] would have, he knew some of you could
[1:41:13] only prosper around Kentucky with the
[1:41:16] rolling hills and the farmlands. Oh, God
[1:41:18] placed you here. Why? Because he knew
[1:41:20] your nature. He knew where it would be
[1:41:23] so that you could prosper in the word.
[1:41:25] He didn't place you in a desert. He
[1:41:27] didn't place you on a mountaintop. He
[1:41:29] didn't place you in the water. He placed
[1:41:30] you right here. Why? So that you could
[1:41:32] be the materialized thoughts of God.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; He was going to have a church here. He
[1:41:38] already planted a church here long
[1:41:40] before there was a world. and he already
[1:41:42] moved up on our pastor's heart to accept
[1:41:44] a invitation to come when there was a
[1:41:47] little white building.
[1:41:51] God had you in his thoughts.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; He knew your nature.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And what are we doing? Materializing
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; the very eternal thoughts of God.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:10] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Can I keep going?
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say something here. And
[1:42:18] please don't take this the wrong way.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; I want to say something. I want you to
[1:42:23] hear what the spirit will say behind it.
[1:42:26] And I'm not trying to make myself out to
[1:42:28] be a prophet. Please don't get that.
[1:42:30] Don't clip that on the internet. If you
[1:42:32] got that, then shame on you. You need to
[1:42:34] repent. But I'm just telling you,
[1:42:37] I want to share what God's thinking is
[1:42:39] about you. Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; You know that the bride
[1:42:44] when I did a search out there I wanted
[1:42:47] to find out collectively
[1:42:50] what's the collected thoughts of brother
[1:42:51] Brandham and his ministry.
[1:42:54] What's the collective thoughts? Brother
[1:42:56] Brandham emphasized that the bride
[1:42:58] consists of individuals that are
[1:43:00] predestinated by God before the
[1:43:02] foundation of the world whose spiritual
[1:43:04] genes were in God's thoughts from
[1:43:06] eternity. And we can all say amen to
[1:43:08] that. See, he taught that we as
[1:43:10] believers are the expression of God's
[1:43:12] attributes, chosen to manifest his word
[1:43:15] and glory. And we can all say amen to
[1:43:17] that.
[1:43:19] See, it's always been, and this is what
[1:43:22] I want to say. This, it's always been
[1:43:26] about you.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Didn't fall too good, did it?
[1:43:34] It's always been about you, me.
[1:43:40] It's always been about a bride.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; See, I use this term predominant. You
[1:43:46] know what that word predominant means?
[1:43:48] Strongest or main element. So, one of
[1:43:51] the most predominant thoughts that God
[1:43:53] has had has been you.
[1:43:57] One of the most prevailing thoughts that
[1:44:00] God has always had is been you.
[1:44:04] Well, brother John, I'm struggling with
[1:44:05] that. I thought it was about a prophet.
[1:44:08] Many make it to be about a prophet.
[1:44:11] Many make it to be about special
[1:44:13] ministries. Many make it about special
[1:44:16] men that God have used down through the
[1:44:18] ages. And if we're not careful, that's
[1:44:20] what the devil wants you to make it.
[1:44:23] See, he wants you to get your eyes off
[1:44:24] of you and who he's coming for. Place
[1:44:28] your eyes on a certain man and we begin
[1:44:30] to elevate certain men. We begin to
[1:44:32] elevate certain ministries and we fail
[1:44:34] to see oursel in the word.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; But when we look here, and I'm going to
[1:44:39] take you to a scripture we're all
[1:44:40] familiar with, Malachi 4:5.
[1:44:46] Behold, I send Elijah the prophet.
[1:44:52] Oh, do y'all miss that? Some of y'all
[1:44:54] said, "Amen." I missed a word.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Put that scripture up there if you
[1:44:59] would, please. Malachi 4 and verse five.
[1:45:03] Behold, otherwise take notice.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Recognize I'm doing something.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; you.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; I send
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; you. Come on. Don't be afraid. I'm
[1:45:18] sending it to you. Who am I sending you?
[1:45:20] I'm sending you Elijah. I'm sending you
[1:45:22] a messenger. I'm sending you a prophet
[1:45:25] to do what? Before the great and
[1:45:27] terrible day of the Lord. And he's going
[1:45:28] to turn your heart. Turn it away from
[1:45:31] men. Turn it away from others. Turn it
[1:45:33] away from failures and turn it back to
[1:45:36] the word of God. Back to the eternal
[1:45:38] thoughts of God. I'm turning your heart
[1:45:41] away from unbelief to believe it again.
[1:45:44] Hallelujah. Somebody. Glory to God this
[1:45:47] morning. God sent you a prophet.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; God sent you a messenger.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; It's always been about you.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to share. I'm going to
[1:45:58] show you. I'm not go I'm not off my
[1:46:00] rocker.
[1:46:04] The mystery of God revealed 1963 after
[1:46:07] the opening of the seals.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "His great mystery of
[1:46:11] revelation has been revealed." And the
[1:46:14] bride says, "Amen."
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. His great mystery of revelation.
[1:46:19] Get it? Revelation. He only reveals
[1:46:22] himself to the elect.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; He is the main one. He being Christ. So
[1:46:31] in God,
[1:46:34] he was a healer. There had to be
[1:46:37] somebody needs healing in he God. Christ
[1:46:41] Jesus was to be a savior. There had to
[1:46:43] be somebody to be saved.
[1:46:45] See these thoughts?
[1:46:48] He already knew you. And when he was the
[1:46:50] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:46:53] world, where were you?
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; You were in him then.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; So he knew you then. And notice now then
[1:47:03] he goes on, brother Bam goes on to tell
[1:47:05] us it's a revelation. It's as it's as
[1:47:08] eternal as God's word is eternal. But
[1:47:10] look, there's a three-fold purpose of
[1:47:12] God's great mystery.
[1:47:14] three-fold purpose. God first of that
[1:47:18] purpose is God manifested in Christ.
[1:47:22] Notice here first thing was God wanted
[1:47:24] to reveal himself to the people. He
[1:47:27] couldn't do it as almighty God who
[1:47:29] didn't have a form. He didn't have a a
[1:47:31] body. So he stepped down into the
[1:47:33] physical body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:36] and he became the physical manifestation
[1:47:39] the materialized of who he was. And he
[1:47:42] came in his son Jesus Christ
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; to pay the price. Cuz look, it took a it
[1:47:48] took a kisman redeemer. It look when
[1:47:50] John said no man was found worthy. Let
[1:47:53] me tell you, there ain't no pope, there
[1:47:54] ain't no bishop, there ain't no
[1:47:56] minister, there ain't nobody found
[1:47:57] perfect. But Jesus Christ stepped out
[1:47:59] from behind the throne and he took the
[1:48:02] word and he become the expressed
[1:48:04] thoughts of God and he saved you and he
[1:48:06] bled for you and he redeemed you and he
[1:48:08] healed your body.
[1:48:11] He did it for us.
[1:48:14] He's the main thing.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; But he was sent for somebody.
[1:48:22] He was sent to heal somebody. He was
[1:48:24] sent to deliver somebody. He was sent to
[1:48:27] save somebody.
[1:48:29] Get your eyes off a single man and put
[1:48:32] your eyes on the word.
[1:48:38] Notice
[1:48:39] then Christ second fold of his great
[1:48:43] mystery revelation Christ manifested in
[1:48:46] the church. So now brother man would
[1:48:50] tell us see he wanted to have
[1:48:52] preeminence in his body of believers
[1:48:54] that is his bride that he might live in
[1:48:57] a people that's his purpose.
[1:49:02] Notice to do what? The third fold
[1:49:05] purpose was to restore back Eden. Bring
[1:49:08] back notice take this fallen Eve and
[1:49:11] take her back to an Eden condition
[1:49:13] again. So God doesn't intend for us to
[1:49:17] live in this state eternally.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; thank God. So God manifested in Christ.
[1:49:23] Christ manifested in the church in order
[1:49:25] to redeem that was lost, the lost Eve
[1:49:27] back to the original condition in the
[1:49:29] Garden of Eden. That's the three-fold
[1:49:31] purpose of God. And can I tell you the
[1:49:34] predominant,
[1:49:36] the predominant, the prevailing, the
[1:49:38] strong thought that God has was about
[1:49:41] you. You know, it wasn't about sending a
[1:49:44] prophet, though. We needed a prophet.
[1:49:47] We needed a prophet that would proclaim
[1:49:48] the word. But if we're not careful, we
[1:49:50] get hung up on a prophet. We get hung up
[1:49:52] on a man. We get hung up on a church. We
[1:49:55] get hung up on a ministry. It ain't
[1:49:56] about a man. It's about a bride in this
[1:49:59] hour. It's about God sending you a
[1:50:01] prophet to do what? To turn your heart
[1:50:03] back.
[1:50:05] It's about you this morning. Everything
[1:50:07] that God has done, every message that
[1:50:09] he's ever preached, every man that he's
[1:50:11] ever sent has been with a bride in mind.
[1:50:14] I want a bride. She's the express
[1:50:16] thoughts of God. I want to love her and
[1:50:18] I want her to love me back.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; It's been about you.
[1:50:26] His
[1:50:28] desire wasn't only to say it this way,
[1:50:30] but it it wasn't solely Jesus Christ.
[1:50:34] Jesus had to come for somebody.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; We are that body.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; See, God's great desire was not to just
[1:50:46] be worshiped. He wants to be loved. Now,
[1:50:51] it'll be nice every now and then if I
[1:50:53] walked in the room, Brother Tommy, and
[1:50:55] my wife said, "Welcome home, Lord."
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Sounds good,
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; don't it?
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; You ain't even sitting with your wife.
[1:51:04] Boy, mercy.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, does sound good, doesn't it?
[1:51:13] Just kidding. I better watch my steps. I
[1:51:17] have a new south to church after me.
[1:51:21] But it' be nice, you know. Oh, Lord
[1:51:25] Adams,
[1:51:27] welcome home. I know you had a hard day,
[1:51:28] Lord. Let me wash your feet. No. Come
[1:51:33] on. We live in 2025.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; So, I don't want to be worshiped.
[1:51:44] I want to be loved. Amen.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; When I come home from a hard day, thank
[1:51:48] God I don't have very many of those
[1:51:50] anymore cuz I'm full-time ministry. So,
[1:51:51] that's really great. But you come in and
[1:51:54] you just, you know, you smell the
[1:51:56] cooking.
[1:51:58] Man, she's been slaving away for me. She
[1:52:00] only been on that microwave for five
[1:52:01] minutes, but it smells like she' been
[1:52:02] there for an hour.
[1:52:05] And you go sit down in your nice
[1:52:07] recliner and she comes and sits in your
[1:52:10] lap and kisses you on the cheek. And
[1:52:11] that's what your prophet said. Yeah,
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; that ain't to be worshiped. That's to be
[1:52:17] loved.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; And that's what God, he wants to be
[1:52:21] loved. Yeah, we worship him. But if your
[1:52:24] worship isn't fueled by love, your
[1:52:26] worship is in vain.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; My wife can sit in my lap and if she
[1:52:31] don't love me, she's just sitting in my
[1:52:33] lap and she just a dead weight.
[1:52:38] But if she loves me and she's kissing me
[1:52:40] and hugging me and say, "Honey, woo, you
[1:52:43] looking good today, boy."
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, brothers.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother David. I appreciate
[1:52:50] that. Somebody with me. Josh, you've
[1:52:52] been awful quiet. I'm going to have to
[1:52:54] do marriage counseling when we're done.
[1:52:58] But it's nice to know that you're loved,
[1:53:00] right?
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sisters, let's not leave you
[1:53:04] out. When he's been gone all day and
[1:53:06] you've been wiping bottoms and you've
[1:53:09] been cleaning up and you've been cooking
[1:53:10] and you've been straightening and you
[1:53:12] just aggravated at the world,
[1:53:15] you don't you don't want to come in him
[1:53:17] slinging barking orders and treat you
[1:53:20] like you're a doormat. No, you want to
[1:53:22] be loved. You want to know that you're
[1:53:25] loved. and he comes in and you're in a
[1:53:27] fouled up mood and he comes behind you
[1:53:29] and well, we ain't gonna say what all he
[1:53:32] does because we got kids here.
[1:53:38] But he changes the atmosphere.
[1:53:41] See, if he didn't love you, he wouldn't
[1:53:43] change the atmosphere.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; And sometimes that's when come to the
[1:53:46] house of God, he begins to change your
[1:53:49] atmosphere
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; because some of you came stewed up,
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; tore up, tied up, twisted up. ready to
[1:53:56] turn around and go back home.
[1:53:59] But you got to get beyond that. And he
[1:54:01] comes. We want to be loved. And notice
[1:54:05] we look here in Genesis and we find that
[1:54:09] God dwelt alone in his thoughts. How
[1:54:11] much time do I got? Mercy. I got plenty
[1:54:14] of time. Y'all heard it.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; God dwelt alone with his thoughts. We
[1:54:21] don't know how long because time wasn't
[1:54:23] recorded at that time. But you notice
[1:54:25] after he created all the species, animal
[1:54:29] life and this and that and everything,
[1:54:31] there was Adam.
[1:54:33] And brother Tommy, Adam sat there. He
[1:54:36] didn't have a helpmate. He didn't have a
[1:54:39] wife. He didn't have a mate. He didn't
[1:54:41] have anything. You know what Adam had?
[1:54:43] Adam had his thoughts.
[1:54:46] And Adam would look, man, look at that
[1:54:49] deer. That big buck and that nice dough.
[1:54:53] I wonder what they communicate about.
[1:54:56] Or this, this, and this. This one has a
[1:54:58] mate, and this one has a mate. And no
[1:55:00] doubt Adam is thinking, how would it be
[1:55:02] if I had a mate?
[1:55:04] Man, just someone I can express myself
[1:55:06] to. These animals, they don't speak my
[1:55:09] language and I don't speak their
[1:55:11] language.
[1:55:13] And what did God do? God said in his own
[1:55:15] word, it is good
[1:55:17] for man not to be alone.
[1:55:21] See, God knew the struggle.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; I hope you're getting this. God knew
[1:55:28] what he wanted, what was inside of him.
[1:55:30] And here is his son with the same
[1:55:33] attributes.
[1:55:35] I don't want to be alone,
[1:55:38] but I want to express myself. I want a
[1:55:41] wife, someone I can love,
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; and someone that will love me back.
[1:55:50] That's why we are here. Do you honestly
[1:55:53] think that the church system can love
[1:55:55] him the way he desires to be loved?
[1:55:59] How can it? They don't have the truth of
[1:56:01] the word.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; But we do. Notice, I love how Adam would
[1:56:06] tell us in Genesis 2 and verse 26, the
[1:56:09] Bible, let's go to verse 21. And God
[1:56:12] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[1:56:14] and he slept.
[1:56:16] And he took one of his ribs, and he
[1:56:18] closed up the flesh instead thereof. And
[1:56:21] the rib which the Lord had taken from
[1:56:23] man made he a woman. And he brought her
[1:56:26] unto man. And Adam said, "This is now
[1:56:28] bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh. She
[1:56:31] shall be called woman because she was
[1:56:33] taken out of man."
[1:56:36] Then in the rising of the sun, your
[1:56:39] prophet caught the inspiration.
[1:56:43] Your prophet caught the inspiration. He
[1:56:45] said, "He being the groom, the bride has
[1:56:47] to come forth because it's part of him."
[1:56:49] And it can only be the manifestation of
[1:56:52] the fulfilling of all the revelations in
[1:56:54] the others that spoke of the bride. It
[1:56:56] can only manifest if it does something
[1:56:59] different from the groom. Then it isn't
[1:57:01] the bride because she is flesh of his
[1:57:04] flesh, bone of his bone, life of his
[1:57:06] life, power of his power. She is him,
[1:57:10] church. That's who we are. We are the
[1:57:13] very intricate thoughts of God in this
[1:57:16] hour being materialized. We didn't He
[1:57:19] didn't pluck you from a denomination. He
[1:57:21] didn't pluck you from a field. He
[1:57:23] thought of you in his very thoughts in
[1:57:24] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:57:27] world.
[1:57:30] And he wanted he's always wanted a
[1:57:34] faithful bride.
[1:57:39] Listen what he says in the New
[1:57:40] Testament. Ephesians 5:24. Therefore, as
[1:57:43] a church is subject unto Christ, so let
[1:57:46] the wise be to their own husbands and
[1:57:47] everything.
[1:57:50] Oh, we don't have no women's live people
[1:57:52] here.
[1:57:54] Wise got to be subject. What kind of
[1:57:56] mess is that? We're in 2025, Brother
[1:57:58] Joe.
[1:58:00] Women's suffrage movement. No, that's
[1:58:03] for them.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; We're not them. She's him.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Listen. Verse 25. Husbands. All right,
[1:58:11] husbands.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Now, he's rebuking you or he's putting
[1:58:14] it on you. Husbands, love your wives.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; She's not a doormat.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; She's not a kicking post.
[1:58:26] Don't put her under your thumb.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Understand this is Bible. This is Paul.
[1:58:31] And we're preaching Paul's message in
[1:58:33] 2025. Husbands,
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; husbands, how many husbands, raise your
[1:58:38] hands. Husbands, husbands, love your
[1:58:41] wives.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice, even as Christ also loved
[1:58:48] the church, that he gave himself for it,
[1:58:51] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:58:53] with the washing of the water of the
[1:58:54] word, that he might present to himself a
[1:58:58] glorious truth. He is wanting and his
[1:59:01] intentions are to present himself a
[1:59:03] wife, a bride without spot, without
[1:59:07] wrinkle, without blemish, without any
[1:59:09] such thing, perfect
[1:59:13] within and without. Then he goes on,
[1:59:15] brother Bam goes on, he says, "God
[1:59:16] intended this church to be a powerful
[1:59:19] church, a glorious church, a church that
[1:59:21] the whole world could look upon as the
[1:59:24] bride of Christ, well expected and
[1:59:26] espoused, and to live in such an
[1:59:28] atmosphere and conduct itself in such a
[1:59:29] way that God would be proud of his
[1:59:32] church to present it to Christ at the
[1:59:33] coming of the Lord."
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; He wants a wife. Let me tell you, I got
[1:59:40] a great wife. If I didn't, she wouldn't
[1:59:42] be with me on this trip.
[1:59:45] I got a wonderful wife always, brother
[1:59:48] John. For 20some years, she has been
[1:59:50] faithful. When man had talked about me,
[1:59:52] brother Thomas, she has been there and
[1:59:54] she has caressed me and care for me and
[1:59:56] cons consoled me and all these other
[1:59:59] different things. That's a godly wife.
[2:00:03] And as a husband, I provide for her
[2:00:07] needs and her means
[2:00:10] spiritually, emotionally, physically,
[2:00:12] all these things. That's our
[2:00:14] responsibility.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; And if that's in the natural, what about
[2:00:19] the spiritual aspect with God and his
[2:00:21] wife?
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; I told a church the other day, I believe
[2:00:24] I was in I was there in South Carolina.
[2:00:27] I believe our sister was out there with
[2:00:28] us. I was preaching at all Spanish
[2:00:30] church. I may have been there. There may
[2:00:31] have been something else when I left
[2:00:32] here last. I said, "Man, when I got
[2:00:35] married, brother brother Brad, I put up
[2:00:37] a sign. I'm off the market.
[2:00:41] I'm not looking and don't be looking at
[2:00:43] me cuz I'm happy with where I'm at."
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; And I will tell you, young brothers, you
[2:00:49] claiming you going to get married and
[2:00:50] you still looking, you still chatting,
[2:00:52] you still conversing with other girls,
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; you ain't ready.
[2:00:57] Young girls, you still snapping and
[2:00:59] chatting and Instagramming and all these
[2:01:02] other little social media platforms we
[2:01:03] got with other boys and you claiming
[2:01:05] he's the one
[2:01:07] and you bat them little eyes and your
[2:01:08] heart goes peac.
[2:01:10] No, but when you know they're the one is
[2:01:13] when you're ready to take yourself off
[2:01:14] the market.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the bride is off the
[2:01:18] market.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; She's off the market. Satan, you can't
[2:01:21] have her. You can't touch her. She ain't
[2:01:24] going. She ain't dancing with you. She
[2:01:26] ain't singing your music. She ain't
[2:01:27] doing your drugs. She ain't doing
[2:01:29] nothing. Why? She's off the market.
[2:01:31] She's been spoken for.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; And he's going to present himself
[2:01:37] a glorious church.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Notice he would go on to tell us,
[2:01:42] brother Random goes on to tell us many,
[2:01:44] many, many things. And I might have to
[2:01:45] skip some of this, but I want to hit a
[2:01:46] highlight. He said, "God never intended,
[2:01:49] he expected this earth to be inhabited,
[2:01:51] so he just made a a woman to bring
[2:01:53] children." He said it still pours the
[2:01:55] calcium and the pot ash and the elements
[2:01:56] into them builds them up. Then he brings
[2:01:58] them a place and lets you make a he
[2:02:00] brings it to a place and lets you make a
[2:02:01] choice. So God never he said he never
[2:02:04] will be defeated.
[2:02:07] See, if he goes on, he says, "Now if
[2:02:10] without a choice, God made me one day a
[2:02:12] young man strong, healthy, happy, and
[2:02:14] the Holy Spirit, not some cold, formal
[2:02:16] theological
[2:02:17] seminary dogma that the devil wants to
[2:02:21] make our churches today when you can't
[2:02:23] have a shout in a church. You can't have
[2:02:26] an amen in the house of God. There's no
[2:02:27] more altar calls, no more prayer lines."
[2:02:30] See, he said, "The Holy Spirit is God's
[2:02:32] program. They begin to woo over me and
[2:02:34] make love to me and I accepted him and
[2:02:36] then he came down into my heart and he
[2:02:38] took his place and is now how much
[2:02:39] assurance have I got that I that he'll
[2:02:41] raise me up in the last days. God gave
[2:02:44] the promise and the Holy Spirit rules
[2:02:47] the church.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; We don't need man-made leadership. We
[2:02:54] don't need
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; headquarters.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Every pastor is a sovereign head of the
[2:03:01] local assembly.
[2:03:03] Much to somebody's dismay and other
[2:03:05] people's we think we got to all carbon
[2:03:07] copy everything the way brother Brandham
[2:03:08] set up the uh the the church there the
[2:03:11] Brandham tabernacle that was for
[2:03:13] Brandham Tabernacle and that is a good
[2:03:15] structure and statue to have. But if
[2:03:17] we're going to cherrypick what we can
[2:03:19] have from how he set up church order,
[2:03:21] then we need to make sure we do the the
[2:03:23] uh the Sunday school lesson every
[2:03:25] morning. We got to give a report every
[2:03:26] morning. We can only preach 45 minutes.
[2:03:28] And y'all already blasted me out of the
[2:03:29] pulpit because I've been way longer than
[2:03:30] 45 minutes.
[2:03:32] But we find we cherrypick little aspects
[2:03:34] how we're going to set our church up.
[2:03:36] And then when it doesn't fit in other
[2:03:38] people's mode, they blast us for the way
[2:03:40] we structure our church. But every
[2:03:42] church is sovereign.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; And God expects the Holy Spirit to lead
[2:03:47] the church.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Thomas and I, we're great
[2:03:50] friends, but we may not see eye to eye
[2:03:52] on everything, but it doesn't matter.
[2:03:53] This is his church. And if I see
[2:03:56] something different, I'm not going to
[2:03:57] preach something arbitrarily to be
[2:03:59] different and to be argumentative and to
[2:04:00] bring confusion. Shame on me if I was to
[2:04:02] do that. We have to respect the
[2:04:04] ministry, respect the leadership,
[2:04:07] respect the church. But the Holy Ghost
[2:04:08] has placed each of us in the body of
[2:04:10] Christ. And he says, "And we're helpless
[2:04:12] to maneuver without every member of the
[2:04:15] body." So God placed you here. He didn't
[2:04:18] place you in the Louisiana heat.
[2:04:22] It is miserable in Louisiana right now.
[2:04:25] God awful hot, humid.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for that church, I wouldn't
[2:04:30] be there
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; because there ain't nothing else.
[2:04:32] Louisiana is ugly.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; And the Louisiana people said, "Amen."
[2:04:38] They're scared to say amen in case this
[2:04:40] gets streamed.
[2:04:42] But notice
[2:04:45] he tells us in first Corinthians he Paul
[2:04:47] tells us for as a body is one has many
[2:04:49] members. All of the members of that body
[2:04:51] being many are one body so also is
[2:04:54] Christ. For by one spirit are we all
[2:04:56] baptized into the body. So it's by one
[2:04:58] spirit that we become into that body.
[2:05:02] And he provided us a means to become
[2:05:05] into that body. And brother Bam tells us
[2:05:08] a story. He says, "Before there was a
[2:05:10] foundation of the world, he took a
[2:05:12] picture."
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; I love what he says in the unconditional
[2:05:18] covenant that God made with his people.
[2:05:20] He said when he brings a little baby in
[2:05:22] the earth, he lets it grow to maturity.
[2:05:24] He's painting a picture in his great
[2:05:26] infinite mind. See, that's a young man,
[2:05:28] a young woman. It's just at its best.
[2:05:31] And when it's standing there at its
[2:05:33] best, then he says, "That's right.
[2:05:35] That's the way I want them in the
[2:05:37] resurrection.
[2:05:39] So God at your best.
[2:05:42] Thank God he didn't wait till I turned
[2:05:44] 50. Look like a upside down melted ice
[2:05:48] cream cone.
[2:05:50] He didn't wait. Don't y'all laugh?
[2:05:53] All y'all laughing at me like you ain't
[2:05:55] got your own ice cream belly.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; But he took a picture at your best.
[2:06:05] Thank you, Lord.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Not when you were 19, not when you were
[2:06:09] 20, not when you were this, not when you
[2:06:11] were that, but he took a picture of you
[2:06:15] at your best. And he says the picture is
[2:06:18] the main thing.
[2:06:21] See, then in the resurrection, those
[2:06:23] gases and asses and things come right
[2:06:25] back into place and develops that
[2:06:27] picture again. See, now this picture was
[2:06:30] not taken when you were 16, 18, 20 years
[2:06:32] old at your best. He says, "When was it
[2:06:34] taken?" "Before the foundation of the
[2:06:37] world, it was put on God's great file."
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; God took a picture. Not only did he have
[2:06:45] you in his stalls, he took an image of
[2:06:48] you. This is going to be them at their
[2:06:52] best.
[2:06:54] And notice I'll say this and he goes on
[2:06:58] to say, "And nothing can destroy that
[2:07:01] profile or that picture.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; That picture is in God's great gallery
[2:07:08] up there. It cannot destroy. It's in
[2:07:10] heaven. You can burn it, feed it to
[2:07:12] lions, do anything you want to with it.
[2:07:14] It'll come forth again just as sure as
[2:07:17] two twos is four." So no matter the
[2:07:19] trial you're going through, the
[2:07:20] hardships that you face, nothing can
[2:07:22] destroy that profile. No matter the
[2:07:24] sickness that comes your way, whether it
[2:07:26] be cancer, whether it be heart trouble,
[2:07:28] whether it be mind battles, depression,
[2:07:30] anxieties, oppression, nothing can
[2:07:32] destroy that profile. Satan cannot
[2:07:35] destroy the thoughts of God because
[2:07:37] Satan does not have access to the mind
[2:07:40] of God. And God doesn't share his
[2:07:43] thoughts with his enemy. God only shares
[2:07:46] his thoughts with his bride.
[2:07:50] What am I telling you? I'm telling you,
[2:07:52] you can't be defeated this morning. You
[2:07:54] can't be destroyed this morning. Those
[2:07:56] thoughts of God are eternal. And you're
[2:07:59] just as eternal this morning as God is.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; So, we find what does God do? God sends
[2:08:06] the word. Yeah.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; And we understand in Amos 3:7, surely
[2:08:11] the Lord God would do nothing but what
[2:08:12] he reveals his secrets to his servants,
[2:08:14] the prophets. So we understand that God
[2:08:17] reveals his word to the prophet and the
[2:08:20] prophet will in hand take that word and
[2:08:23] hand it down to the believer.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; That's a scriptural order.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; But notice
[2:08:31] 1963, the voice of God in the last days.
[2:08:34] A prophet of course is a preacher. A
[2:08:37] modern word prophet absolute me
[2:08:39] absolutely means a man that preaches
[2:08:42] under inspiration.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; A man that preaches under inspiration.
[2:08:48] What is he doing? He's catching the very
[2:08:51] thoughts of God
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; and he comes and stands behind the
[2:08:55] pullpit and he begins to share those
[2:08:58] thoughts with you.
[2:09:00] Yeah.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Not just a vindicated word prophet that
[2:09:05] we don't preach anything but what a word
[2:09:06] prophet already preached. And only a
[2:09:08] prophet can only say what the prophets
[2:09:10] before him had said. We're preaching the
[2:09:12] same message that Paul preached.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; He said the God's word is in his spirit
[2:09:18] and his word comes in his prophet and
[2:09:20] the word is supposed to transform you
[2:09:22] from what things of the world are into
[2:09:24] the image of sons and daughters of God.
[2:09:26] And the word can only come through these
[2:09:28] prophets as they spoke. It had to be
[2:09:30] compared with the word and showed that
[2:09:31] it was with the word. And if you accept
[2:09:33] the word, it'll transform you from sons
[2:09:35] of the world and daughters of the world
[2:09:37] to sons and daughters of God. And you
[2:09:40] become the word. You become the word as
[2:09:43] you receive the word.
[2:09:46] You become the word. You become the
[2:09:49] expressed thoughts of God. As you
[2:09:51] receive the word,
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; you can come in here and you can shout
[2:09:56] and you can do all that and your
[2:09:57] neighbor sit there hard and and and
[2:10:00] closed off and not get nothing from the
[2:10:02] same atmosphere.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Because it's based on how you receive
[2:10:07] the word.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this word.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Let me go on to try to bring this wrap
[2:10:16] this up.
[2:10:17] He said now his attribute the attribute
[2:10:21] was first God. So God he had a thought
[2:10:25] and attribute in itself is all one
[2:10:27] without being expressed. So he said
[2:10:29] attribute was first he was a before it
[2:10:31] was anything it was an attribute it was
[2:10:32] a thought and it was God and God had
[2:10:34] these thoughts. This is what he's going
[2:10:35] to do. So God knew this day as much as
[2:10:38] he knew the day of creation. Then the
[2:10:41] second thing what he did he said then he
[2:10:43] be to express secondarily he became then
[2:10:47] the word and then the word was made
[2:10:49] flesh and dwelt among us and we
[2:10:50] understand the scripture in the
[2:10:51] beginning was the word and when when
[2:10:53] time began it was the word but before it
[2:10:55] was the word it was an attribute of
[2:10:57] thought then it was expressed in the
[2:10:58] beginning was the word and he goes into
[2:11:02] this Melzdc and he said that's a
[2:11:04] mysterious person because you know what
[2:11:06] Melzdc he said Melzdc became Jesus
[2:11:09] Christ
[2:11:11] and Melzdc came in a word body. You and
[2:11:16] I bypassed that word body to be tested
[2:11:18] in the flesh.
[2:11:20] You say, "Well, why are you bringing in
[2:11:22] this Melzdc?" Because what he was, we're
[2:11:24] going back to.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; We won't always be in this body.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; We're going to take on a theophony body,
[2:11:31] a word body.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; So, let me keep going here.
[2:11:39] God chose a man and he's speaking about
[2:11:41] Abraham. God chose a man 50 at 75 years
[2:11:45] old and a woman at 65 to do his purpose.
[2:11:49] Remember, purpose is a thought.
[2:11:53] Why in the world would God pick a man 75
[2:11:57] years old and a woman 65 year old to
[2:12:00] have a baby?
[2:12:03] Let me let that sit on your brain for a
[2:12:05] minute, Sarah.
[2:12:10] Not me.
[2:12:13] I'm 25 years younger than Abraham and
[2:12:15] I'm saying us four and no more.
[2:12:19] We done. Quivers's full. Thank you,
[2:12:21] Lord. But here, Abraham, 75 years old.
[2:12:25] Sarah, 65 years old, to do his purpose,
[2:12:32] to show that you can both be young and
[2:12:34] old, God can steal and will work out his
[2:12:37] purpose. And when Abraham was 75, he got
[2:12:40] the promise of God and he told it to
[2:12:42] Sarah. Now, notice what the devil did.
[2:12:45] He said, "Now, now the devil said, you
[2:12:47] know what? I'm going to I'm going to
[2:12:49] delay that for a while. I believe if if
[2:12:51] I'll get them so old, they'll lose faith
[2:12:54] and they'll they'll not know that it can
[2:12:57] happen.
[2:12:58] That's what he does. You God gives you a
[2:13:00] promise in a service and the devil delay
[2:13:02] it and delay it and delay it and to
[2:13:05] delay it to get you to doubt, to get you
[2:13:11] to have unbelief. He says, "If they've
[2:13:14] already shaken at 75, if they can if I
[2:13:17] can get them away for a while, I can
[2:13:19] keep it away until Abraham and Sarah
[2:13:21] just was stooped in age, gray hairs, and
[2:13:23] stooped shoulders." He goes, "It goes to
[2:13:25] show that nothing can defeat his
[2:13:27] purpose."
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Not even death can defeat the purpose of
[2:13:32] God.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Abraham was as good as dead. Sarah's
[2:13:35] womb had been dead for 40, 50 years. But
[2:13:38] nothing can defeat God's purpose. Her
[2:13:41] body was old. It was wrinkled. The milk
[2:13:43] veins dried up. Her heart was so weak.
[2:13:45] It could not have went through labor.
[2:13:47] But God let us know there that his
[2:13:49] purpose will not be defeated. And he
[2:13:52] changed Sarah back. What am I telling
[2:13:54] you church? That I know the thoughts
[2:13:56] that I think toward you little bride.
[2:13:58] Thoughts of peace and not of evil. I got
[2:14:01] a purpose for you. I got a plan for you.
[2:14:04] And ain't no devil in hell, no old age,
[2:14:06] no sickness, no cancer will defeat the
[2:14:09] purpose and plan that God has for you in
[2:14:11] this hour. God's purpose will not be
[2:14:14] defeated.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Musicians come, he says God, he says
[2:14:19] Abraham could endure it seeing him who
[2:14:21] was invisible because why? It was the
[2:14:23] purpose of God that he know that God
[2:14:25] gave him the promise and no matter how
[2:14:28] contrary everything seemed, God gave
[2:14:30] Abraham the promise. So God fulfilled
[2:14:33] his promise. He did to Abraham. He did
[2:14:35] it to all his children. He will keep his
[2:14:37] promise. And can I tell you in 2025, God
[2:14:40] will keep his promise to you this
[2:14:42] morning. He's the same yesterday, today,
[2:14:45] and forever. He's never been defeated.
[2:14:47] He's never lost a battle. He's never
[2:14:49] given up. God will reward you for
[2:14:52] staying with the promise of God.
[2:14:55] He said, "Hell can't defeat the promise
[2:14:57] of God."
[2:14:59] They could have they heated the furnace
[2:15:01] up seven times hotter.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; It didn't defeat the promise of God.
[2:15:07] They starve those lines for months. It
[2:15:09] didn't defeat the promise of God.
[2:15:12] And they can turn this world upside
[2:15:14] down. Satan can create his Eden, but it
[2:15:17] will not defeat the purpose of God. God
[2:15:20] will have a church.
[2:15:25] God will have a bride
[2:15:29] and you are that bride. I know the plans
[2:15:35] that I have for you.
[2:15:39] Plans of peace, not of evil, to bring
[2:15:43] you to an expected rapture,
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; an expected body change. It may be
[2:15:52] unexpected by the world,
[2:15:55] but for this bride, it's expected
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; for this bride. Bible says he can do
[2:16:01] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[2:16:03] can even ask or think. For this bride,
[2:16:07] it's expected. All the hydrogen bombs in
[2:16:10] the world can never defeat the purpose
[2:16:14] of God.
[2:16:17] And as last quote,
[2:16:20] Jesus Christ is choosing his bride
[2:16:26] just the same way men choose their
[2:16:29] bride.
[2:16:32] Now, Gideon,
[2:16:35] I get to use you because you're my
[2:16:37] buddy.
[2:16:38] Maybe one day you want a wife.
[2:16:43] Nice little girl. Got her eyes on you,
[2:16:44] Giddy. She make them little bitty eyes.
[2:16:48] But you know what? As much as she Oh,
[2:16:52] giddy giddy giddy. She's giddy about
[2:16:54] Gideon.
[2:16:56] She's not going to just get up off the
[2:16:58] pew and come over here and say, "Hey,
[2:16:59] boy. I like you.
[2:17:02] I think I'm gonna marry you." That's not
[2:17:05] how it works, is it? No. No. That's not
[2:17:08] how it works. Get in. No. The answer is
[2:17:10] no. Okay, I'm gonna walk you through
[2:17:13] this. Hold on.
[2:17:15] But
[2:17:17] but Christ is choosing his bride the way
[2:17:19] we choose our bride. Paul,
[2:17:23] I get to use you now.
[2:17:26] And you got your eyes like looking far
[2:17:29] and wide. Where's she at?
[2:17:33] Far. What are you looking for? Looking
[2:17:37] for character.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for character. I'm looking
[2:17:42] for somebody that matches me.
[2:17:45] somebody that has something inside of
[2:17:47] them that responds to who I am. And see,
[2:17:51] that's what Christ is doing. He ain't
[2:17:53] looking for just any church.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; He's not just looking for any bride.
[2:17:59] He's looking for that one that was in
[2:18:02] his thoughts. And maybe Paul, you may
[2:18:05] have laid in that bed thinking about
[2:18:07] this one and about that one. thoughts
[2:18:10] and thoughts and thoughts and thoughts
[2:18:12] and thoughts and thoughts.
[2:18:15] But then you begin to look, does this
[2:18:18] fit the thought? Does this fit the I
[2:18:19] hope you're picking this up. Does this
[2:18:22] fit the thought? Does she fit the
[2:18:24] thought? Does this one fit the thought?
[2:18:27] Because you have to be in the thought to
[2:18:30] be in union with him.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Because he's only coming for those that
[2:18:35] was in his thinking. So he says he's
[2:18:38] choosing a bride the same way we choose
[2:18:42] a bride. Now before I chose my bride, I
[2:18:47] looked.
[2:18:49] You know what we call that? Window
[2:18:51] shopping.
[2:18:55] But there's got to be a time you quit
[2:18:57] window shopping and you go inside and
[2:18:59] make a purchase.
[2:19:02] I hope somebody's hearing me. You got to
[2:19:04] quit window shopping because you know
[2:19:08] this is the one. And can I tell you
[2:19:10] that's what he did. He's done with
[2:19:13] window shopping. He's chosen his wife.
[2:19:17] Listen what a prophet says. And I'll
[2:19:19] close this out.
[2:19:22] He said he chooses his bride the same
[2:19:24] way men chooses their brides today. The
[2:19:26] bride today doesn't simply decide she's
[2:19:29] going to take a certain man for her
[2:19:30] husband.
[2:19:33] No sir, it is the groom who decides and
[2:19:36] chooses a certain woman for his bride.
[2:19:38] John 15:1 16. You have not chosen me,
[2:19:41] but I have chosen you. Now, according to
[2:19:43] the word of God, the bride was chosen
[2:19:46] before the foundation of the world. The
[2:19:49] choosing of the bride was purposed in
[2:19:52] himself.
[2:19:53] Purpose. Back to thought.
[2:19:56] See Ephesians 1:9 and in Romans 9:11 it
[2:19:59] says that the purpose of God according
[2:20:01] to election might stand. He goes you
[2:20:03] can't read it read it any other way. The
[2:20:06] heart purpose the eternal purpose of God
[2:20:10] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[2:20:12] and that purpose was in in himself and
[2:20:15] being eternal was decreed before the
[2:20:17] foundation of the world. Then he goes on
[2:20:20] in the SRA churches and he says he was
[2:20:23] known only as eternal spirit
[2:20:26] but the bride was already in his mind.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; You've been chosen
[2:20:35] to be his bride. You are already in his
[2:20:39] thoughts. And now we are materializing
[2:20:45] the very eternal thoughts that God has
[2:20:48] always had. Can I tell you, take your
[2:20:51] eyes off your failures this morning.
[2:20:53] Take your eyes off your struggles, off
[2:20:56] your sicknesses, off the things that
[2:20:58] have been pressuring you and bothering
[2:21:00] you. Look to the word.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; You come from God
[2:21:06] and we're going back to God. And that's
[2:21:09] the end of it. We're not listening to a
[2:21:11] lie of the enemy. We're not going to
[2:21:12] look at our failures. We're not going to
[2:21:14] look at family strains. We're not going
[2:21:15] to look at disappointments. We're going
[2:21:17] to look to what the word says. And the
[2:21:20] word has already been spoken over a
[2:21:22] people. I will have a bride.
[2:21:28] Let's worship the Lord. Stand up to your
[2:21:29] feet. Come on, brother David.
[2:21:38] living in me
[2:21:40] to tell
[2:21:43] the world
[2:21:46] that he is the same.
[2:21:52] Oh, he's the same
[2:21:55] yesterday
[2:21:58] and today
[2:22:00] and forever.
[2:22:04] Jesus,
[2:22:05] he's alive
[2:22:08] and well. Once again this morning, oh
[2:22:12] he's alive
[2:22:15] and well, living in me
[2:22:19] to tell
[2:22:22] the world
[2:22:24] that he is the same.
[2:22:31] He's the same
[2:22:34] yesterday
[2:22:36] and today
[2:22:39] and forever.
[2:22:42] Jesus
[2:22:44] is alive
[2:22:46] and well.
[2:22:50] Amen. You enjoy that this morning? Amen.
[2:22:54] Aren't you glad he chose you this
[2:22:57] morning? name. Brother Brandham said, "I
[2:22:59] no longer call you church, but I call
[2:23:01] you bride." Amen. Let's sing that little
[2:23:04] song before we go. He's still working on
[2:23:07] me. Amen. I know a lot of you don't need
[2:23:09] as much work as I do, but I'm glad he's
[2:23:12] still working on me this morning, aren't
[2:23:14] you? Well, he's still working on me.
[2:23:20] Oh. To make me what I ought to be.
[2:23:24] Well, it took him just a week to make
[2:23:27] the moon and stars, the sun and the
[2:23:31] earth and Jupiter Mars. How loving and
[2:23:36] patient he must be.
[2:23:39] He's still working on me.
[2:23:43] Well, there really ought to be a sign
[2:23:47] upon my heart. Don't judge me yet.
[2:23:50] There's an unfinished heart, but I'll be
[2:23:54] perfect just according to his plan.
[2:23:58] Fashioned by the master's loving hand.
[2:24:02] Oh, and he's still working on me.
[2:24:07] To make me what I ought to be.
[2:24:11] Oh, it took just a week to make the moon
[2:24:14] and stars, the sun and the earth and
[2:24:18] Jupiter and Mars. How loving and patient
[2:24:22] he must be.
[2:24:25] He's still working on me.
[2:24:29] And in the mirror of his word,
[2:24:32] reflections that I see, it makes me
[2:24:35] wonder why he never gave up on me. He
[2:24:39] loves me as I am and he helps me when I
[2:24:42] pray. Remember, he's the potter I'm the
[2:24:46] clay.
[2:24:47] Oh, and he's still working on me.
[2:24:52] To make me what I ought to be.
[2:24:56] Oh, it took him just a week to make the
[2:24:59] moon and the sun and the earth and
[2:25:04] Jupiter.
[2:25:06] I love you. He must be.
[2:25:10] Oh, he's still working on me.
[2:25:15] Amen. You glad he's still working on you
[2:25:17] this morning? Amen. Is that all, Brother
[2:25:19] Thomas? Amen. Remember, the service
[2:25:22] starts this afternoon at 2:30 and uh
[2:25:24] we're we invite everyone to come and
[2:25:26] eat. Amen. And Amen. Let's let's just go
[2:25:30] and have a good afternoon of fellowship
[2:25:32] and then come back and see what God has
[2:25:34] for us again. God bless you.
