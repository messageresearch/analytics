TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] from [Music] do [Music] so [Music] you [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] foreign good evening good to be in the house of the lord amen amen god is good i mean i thought i would uh open up with prayer maybe brother austin if you all want to stand with us they're awesome would you open up service and pray for us this evening yes lord yes lord amen you can be seated i know david probably has some prayer requests we may pray again but i just wanted to give a lord a little testimony tonight um amen and so this morning about 5 30 when i was sleeping okay i don't get up real early but at 5 30 i was pretty much out and we have a couple dogs that we keep in the house and a little doggy door that goes out to the outside where they can get out and all and uh sometimes in the morning if they hear me get up they'll come up there and you know they want to be petted so they'll just get up there and be better and sometimes to get up there before i wake up and they'll jump on put their feet on the side of the bed and i'll reach over there and pet them a little bit and say all right and i go you know and pet him and stuff and uh so i can always hear them when they come up the stairway but you know but um this morning you know and we have the alpha weimaraner which his name his name's uh um what's his name donna tracker hungry she's i am tired i was tired but i'm really tired but anyway uh tracker he's the one that we got right at the beginning of uh you know from the beginning when he was out there on the farm so he's really means a lot to us he's very very special dog to us elf dog and he's a good dog but anyway so i was sleeping and i heard him and whatever other dogs we had in the house he come flying up this air i'm like i'm not up yet why you all coming up so fast man anyway that dog come up real fast up the stairs and he jumps and flies up on the bed and i thought man what is he chasing a cat a bird what's going on and he comes across my face he landed in my face in my head what is going on and anyway ended up on the nightstand and and down on the floor i said this is right show me right so i jumped up it's still dark so i turned the light on so i find him on the floor laying on against the wall with his mouth open and kind of kicking he was just dying he was like passed out he you know and so anyway i was like what in the world so he had his mouth wide open and so he must you know if he could have done anything else he would have but i know he must have probably passed out about the time that he was hit my head in the nightstand because it was a big flop and just fell down on the floor like and anyway so i seen his mouth open and i just presume something down his throat or whatever so i reached in his mouth went babe as far as i could and i felt something it felt you know we still don't know what it was but it felt like you know maybe dog food wadded up a lot of dog food or whatever and i couldn't get in behind it so i pushed my finger like beside it through it or whatever and just push whatever it was just pushed it further down you know and there he was still laying and still doing his mouth thing so i give him a good hard push on his chest you know my wife's like menu don't bust his chest but i couldn't give him no cpr you know so i just put a put a good heart on push hard on his chest without you know breaking his ribs or anything but and then uh he had his mouth wide open all of a sudden he like closed his mouth and just a little bit and directly he kind of just tried to pick his head up and he looked at us and he was like back you know he didn't know he didn't know where he was what was going on he had passed out apparently and coming back too he had had no oxygen i guess for a little bit and so anyway he didn't really recognize us and then we talked to him a little bit and talked to him and all of a sudden i mean just like that i don't know if it was putting it pushing that down or the chest or what it was but donna was praying i said donna help me you know because he was it was really kind of traumatic for me because everyone my favorite dog was laying there dying and the thing of it was he knew his condition and that's why he called him people in the bird or a cat he's trying to live but anyway so he breathed began to breathe again you know just like it was all over and it took probably 20 minutes for him to really get his bearings about him and you know and and everything but i was just thankful that the lord spared him amen you know because he was very close he was very close and he and realized he was coming for help because that's as far as he made it was about my head and after that he just kind of crashed but i just thank the lord that he spirit buried him at all that's why that course is singing more than ever before lord i need you oh more than ever before lord i love you more than ever before more than ever [Music] again if we could

tonight oh it's um [Music] [Music] me i once was lost i was blind but now i see it was grace it was my heart [Music] freshers you happy to be a christian amen happy that god called you out of sin and darkness amen what a what a privileged people we are you can be seated for just a minute just a couple of little things that i want to make mention of thank you for the music tonight i spoke to brother ben norrod i didn't speak to him he sent me a text and maybe some of you got it too but he wanted me to share with the church that if you remember the last time he was here he was talking about i guess with his diabetic neuropathy and so forth that his eyes were giving him trouble and they were thinking maybe you know they were telling him you know they were telling him that blindness could be in his future and he went for a series of tests and and he had to have some injections some time ago and he sent me today a text and i wish i had it but i left my phone at home but he just said praise the lord my eyes were perfect they told me that said not to even worry about coming back for i think he said six months just for a checkup so god's still a healer god's still alive amen [Applause] and you know i tell you what it's just uh god's good we're living in an hour where god will manifest himself if we ask and and i think that's what we have to come to do uh tonight um i got on my heart some time ago this little thought and and i want to speak on worship and praise and it's been on my mind for a while and then this last week we've done some traveling with our idea with my boys they uh we're on a school trip playing playing baseball down in florida uh you know that's a sound like a good trip baseball in florida but you know my boys go to a christian school and and the coach is a pastor of a church and i think there were three or four other pastors there and so they did give their daily devotions and and they asked me to finish up on the last day there with daily devotions and and you know they spoke about repentance and second chances and and the cross and salvation just great great guys and men of you know that preach the word and i tell you it really makes you it makes me i shouldn't say it makes you but it makes me sometimes when i see how they can dissect the word in the bible it kind of makes me feel a little small sometimes you know because they're scholars and and i don't get my messages that way i pray and i pray that god leads me and i'll take it that way if he'd given it so but this little thought on worship and praise and it went real well the little devotion that we had and so i want to continue and get a little deeper into it tonight if we could and what i want to do is i want to ask ourselves the question um if you don't mind stand and start turning to psalms 138 but ask the question that i want to ask is does god demand our praise and if so how do we meet this demand and what happens when we give god praise so that's that's three pretty big questions right there uh does god demand it how do we meet that meet that demand and what happens when we give god praise and i thought you know this was fitting compared to or following up with brother byler's last message uh and he spoke about cain and cain you know brought his his worship he brought his sacrifice to the altar and god didn't accept it and god said i'll require you to do it this way or else and so god basically said i'm demanding you to bring your sacrifice in this fashion or else i don't accept it so as we read these scriptures here let's look at this and i got my eyes on the clock what i can see so i'll try not to hold us too long i don't think we will so psalms 138 david speaking i will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will i sing praise unto thee i will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name in the day when i cried thou answered us me and strengtheneth me with strength in my soul all the kings of the earth shall praise thee o lord when they hear the words of thy mouth look at this here david david's saying here he's going to be heard he's going to let his voice sound above everybody who god is yea they shall sing in the ways of the lord for great is the glory of the lord though the lord be high yet hath he respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth afar off though i walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies and thy right hand shall save me the lord will perfect that which concerneth me do you hear that the lord will perfect that which concerneth me so david says anything that i'm going through in life god will perfect that god will perfect whatever challenges i have god will protect it and look what the next statement is he says thy mercy david knew where he stood he knew he still needed god's mercy thy mercy o lord endureth forever forsake not the works of thine own hands let's just pray as if we could heavenly father we thank you lord for this day you've given us well lord we thank you for the opportunity to speak your word lord lord i just pray lord that the words would not come from my mouth lord but that you would control the thoughts of my mind and the intents of my heart lord that it would be pleasing to you lord that whatever i say would be exactly what you would have said lord lord when i think about this topic lord and the thought on worship and praise lord and i thank how great you are god how awesome you are that's what i want to do tonight lord is just lift your name on high lord we thank you lord for all you do for us we ask that you've been the remainder of the service tonight lord in jesus name amen as you're seeing turn to psalms 150 if you still got your finger there in psalms a little familiar scripture while you're getting back there this psalm here stands out to us says praise ye the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in his firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the psalter in the heart praise him in the timbrel in the dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs praise him upon the loud symbols praise him upon the high sounding symbols let everything that hath breath praise the lord praise you the lord now we're sitting here today if you're here i hope you're living i hope you're breathing so it's our responsibility as christians if you're alive and you know what god has done for you praise ye the lord so the question does god demand our praise i want to start with this quote this familiar quote we've heard it a million times if you've been around this message you've heard it i was preaching one night and a woman got to screaming and shouting and a little baptist brother told me the next day said i was enjoying your message till that woman went to screaming said you know that made chills run all over my back i said brother you're living in the quietest place in the world that you could live in if you go to hell there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and if you go to heaven they'll be screaming and shouting all the time he said why i said man if it made chills run up your back what will it do when you get to heaven he said well you'll freeze to death when you get there listen this next statement because you'll be so out of place you'll be so out of place now brothers and sisters if if you're out of place there in heaven where does that put us here if we're not worshipping and praising god and lifting god up and into his highest adoration what does that put us here if you don't be in pla if you'll be out of your place in heaven we're heavenly beings for even the angels with wings over their face and over their feet are singing holy holy holy lord god almighty holy holy holy can you imagine all day long an angelic choir holy holy holy non-stop listen god is an object of worship listen he says this god is worshiped worshipped he says it twice he's iterating hitting it strong he says if anything i honor the pentecostal people for is if they let loose and worship god brothers and sisters i believe that one of the biggest hang-ups that we have for the believer today is that letting loose and giving god worship and praise that he has do because let me tell you there's a huge difference a huge difference between getting up here or getting in church and and brother david telling you hey turn to page so and so we're going to sing amazing grace we're going to sing i'm one of them we're going to sing this song there's a big difference between getting up and singing and worship god is great and greatly to be praised so doesn't mean i see this just think about what has god done in your life today i'm just saying today i'm asking you a question for the past 24 hours what has god done for you you woke up you've eaten you're not alone you're clothed you've been protected you've been delivered you've been forgiven you've been sealed until the day of redemption that's just today and that's just just barely scratching paper brothers and sisters there's not enough paper in the heavens to write down what god has done for you since you've been alive but you know what we're living in an age of hustle hustle bustle we live in this age of hustle and bustle and and and and we've got to be here we got to be there we got to go see this person we got to see that person our minds are constantly running at full throttle constantly going wide open and we rarely have time to slow down we rarely have time to slow down sometimes you ladies just hope you have time to fix supper because it's this and this and go here and go there and to be here and be there and i bet if i'm willing to say that 80 to 90 percent of our focus throughout the day is not on god it's the truth 80 to 90 of our focus is not on god's our minds are revolving around work they're revolving around school they're revolving around getting their kids to their activities cooking cleaning money family fun time we gotta have family fun time right and then you gotta rest and relax right the excuses of life the excuses we put up before god's praise then we wake up the next morning we do it all again it's every day around and around and around so where does that leave god at where does that leave god in our lives as christians again blood bought christians listen to what david says he says i'll this is 138 let's break it down i will praise thee with my whole heart and i've been astonished by looking at the life of david you know you think about david first thing he thanks david and goliath you think those things but man you read in samuel and then you read about david and the life he lived he is a man that amazes me he astonishes me because i realize how much i'll fall short when i read about david i realize how much i fall short and we got to be honest with ourselves or we never grow close to god if you want to get closer to god be honest with yourself don't don't fool yourself don't lie to yourself until you are a christian because i do this this and this you better have a relationship of praise and worship to draw god close into your heart listen what david says david says i will praise god with all of my heart wholeheartedly i'm in he's making a commitment to god i'm in wholeheartedly i am in with you god and he's saying there is no room for anything else in my life but you god your whole heart no room for nothing else no room for any kind of activity no room for anything outside of god i'm giving it all to you god don't have to raise your hands but how many of you feel like you're giving 100 to god you agreed with me a minute ago that we're probably not thinking about god 90 of the time so where does that leave us you say well some people might say well oh david he had it made oh king david he had it made he had everything he wanted in life he just set up on the throne he's eating grapes drinking wine everything was fine he didn't have nothing to do but set and praise god that's not true that's not true we're talking about a king of a nation a king of a nation so he was doing a whole lot more than that he was going out he was living that day-to-day activities listen but listen what he says he says the next verse before the gods i will sing praise you say well there's only there's only god to serve there was only god to praise only god was there for him to worship that's not what he says the next line he because he said before the gods little g little g i will praise and sing praise unto thee so somewhere brothers and sisters there was people there somewhere that had other gods they had other idols they had other things that they were involved in and wrapping their lives around and spending their time with and david made a bold statement says out of uh when all these gods are out here and all these people are giving their time and effort and praise to their gods i'm going to sing praises to you god big g he says i will worship toward thy holy temple i will praise thy name for thy lovingkindness for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name so david was just like us he was just like us he's been in the hustle and bustle he's living life as a king he's going here going there meeting this person meeting that president this president you can imagine the life of trying to run a country and he's trying to run a country and serve god and he's running all over the place he wasn't sitting around eating bon bons and enjoying life that's not what david was doing many things around him could have been worshiped many things around him could have been treasured as gods to him but in the midst david says i'll sing praises to you god david worshiped david worshiped god because he knew that deliverance was in praise look at the life of david over and over and over failure after failure after failure but yet he praises and praises and praises because why he knew it was deliverance when he fought the giant when he went before a giant the first thing he said is you will be delivered unto me by my god he was praising god before the fight ever happened how many times do we go into an appointment we go into a doctor's appointment and we we do myself before we ever hear the report and it's hard not to do because science and technology is so so strong so still it's hard not to get yourself in a rut but you somewhere you got to say god will deliver me god will deliver this god will deliver this sickness this cancer this whatever it is god will deliver it unto me praise the lord so no matter what david was facing in life he knew that there was no giant big enough in the land that could stand before him as long as he was praising god and we are believers of the message of the hour forgive me for always throwing this up in our face but it's who we are we're believers of the message of the hour we've been given the revealed word in our day we've already talked about giving our heart to the lord we've already talked about salvation and we've talked about that but we're the message believers of the hour we've been given the revealed word of the day identified as the bride of jesus christ do you realize what that means that god looks at you at you as his sweetheart that he loves you that he adores you that he wants everything that he can do to be for you and where do we put him where do we put him are we giving him the praise he deserves no we're honest probably not no we're not we're all likely falling short but one thing about the believer one thing about the bride of jesus christ is she always wants a closer walk with him there's nothing like if you're having a bad day i can remember some time ago we were living in the other house and i was just having a horrible miserable no good day i think that's a movie a kid's movie but it was that kind of day and it was just like i was so deflete though so just depressed and deflated and and i remember joel's walking in and i just said come here i need you you know wrap your arms around me and just hug me because i need you that's the way god is my bride i need you wrap your arms around me i need you we want that closer walk with god so how do we get it the bible says that the the god inhabits the praise of his people inhabit let me tell you what that word means i think we know but let's break it down the it means of a person or animal or group that lives in a country or to occupy a place or environment this is good news so when we begin to praise god we've had a horrible day we begin to praise god and when we do that something gets set in something begins to click and god begins to spin this in motion and says you know what you need a refilling of the holy ghost i need to send my spirit down to you because you are calling upon me you've praised me you've worshiped me and i'm gonna inhabit you the holy spirit right here that's an amazing thing that god lives right here now let me tell you if god lives right here you're in trouble you're in trouble but when you've praised god genuinely praise and worship god and that holy spirit comes down and inhabits you your life will change because when that happens you begin to get that life of joy love peace long suffering man god's good and when these attributes are on display that's when people say that's a real christian because you're christ-like you have praised god he's filled you with the spirit he's he's renewed your spirit within you and has then displayed himself in front of the world don't take me wrong here worship and praise is not going to save your soul i'm talking about if you've been saved born again filled with the holy ghost those praises go up god's down displays himself in your heart i mean let's face it can you really be angry at somebody while you're singing jesus jesus there's just something about that name can you get mad and red-faced while that's in your thoughts no no you can't do it can you be defeated and depressed while you're singing praise him praise him praise him in the morning praise him in the noon time praise him praise him praise him when the sun goes down can you be depressed singing that kind of song no worship praise worship giving praise one day at a time worship is to honor to reverence to respect to show adoration praise or glory to a superior being so i think i think god demands this worship i think god demands the worship and he alone is worthy of it you know there's something about when you hear your name called you turn around you can be sitting in a crowd of people and somebody say you know what brother brad did you're going to turn are you going rubber you'll break your neck trying to hear what they said about you and you're hoping they say something good and when they do you just kind of smile i'm not worthy of that god is worthy of that god is the one who is worthy that he is a superior being he's the one that demands a praise revelations 4 11 answers this question pretty clear it says thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all all things and for thy pleasure are they and were they created so you're going to tell me he don't he don't desire he don't demand praise when he created us to be objects of praise and object of worship brother brown said god was not even god he was elohim and he created the angel so they would what worship him and many times many times with our little finite minds we get into a place and we fail to praise god because we feel like we're so unworthy to praise god why do you why do we feel that way what is it that makes us feel that way that we look around and we get ready to praise god we think i can't do it i did this i said this i went here resort back to the life of david he wasn't of all people worthy to be praising god adulterer a murderer pushed to push this you right up to the front floor of the battlefield to have him slaughtered that's that's not just murder that's premeditated murder he didn't do it out of anger he did it because he wanted him dead he's not worthy neither am i but there was there was a place called calvary there was a place called calvary where the precious blood of the lamb was shed and that blood was shed to wipe away all the sins of everybody that would ever believe upon that cross and we have to remember that we have to remember that and not play ourselves down but to say god i have failed you today miserably but you're still great you're still you're still awesome you're still mighty i have i've sinned here i failed there i i feel like i'm just a a poor person i can't even call myself a christian but you're still holy and you know what he says i'll come i'll come live there i'll come live there isaiah 53 familiar it's one for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes i'm healed if you never heard any other scripture in your life but that verse right there you've got a reason to praise god if that is all the knowledge you've ever had of the bible and somebody just handed you that little clip right there you're a blessed person let me read you exodus 20. exodus 20. says and god spake these words saying i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage thou shall have no other gods before me thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is an earth beneath or that is a water under the earth thou shall not bow down thyselves to them nor serve them listen to this for i am the lord thy god am a jealous god a jealous god and i show mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments what is a jealous god well you're his bride but god's jealousy is not the jealousy like we have here it's not that envious hatred bitterness green within thee jealousy that's not what god is but god's jealousy is a jealousy that's that was not born out of pride but it's born out of that he is the greatest god of all gods there could ever be and he wants to know that you know he's the one that's worthy of the glory his glory is so powerful it's so magnificent that he wants to nobody else can touch that glory and so he says i'm jealous if you go over here and glorify your car your truck your job your home your kids your wife i want the glory is what he says i'm the one that's worthy i'm the one that gave you all those so god expects us to worship him with reverence and thanksgiving but he also expects us to be obedient to him well we're going to get sticky i'm going to tell you we're going to get sticky god not only wants us to love him but he wants us to worship him by loving others that's a form of worship that's a form of worship he wants us to act like christians to each other he wants us to show love and compassion on others and consideration of others around us he wants us to present ourselves as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to him and i say it gets sticky because of this i'll tell you what people around this message can be some of the meanest nastiest people you'll ever run into but yet they can quote quotes like a machine gun they wipe you out with their quotes they wipe you out with the hatred the envy the jealousy if you're doing something for god they're jealous but they got the quotes that's not the way god commands us to act god says to love your neighbors love your enemy and be holy and pleasing to him treat people as christians should treat people glorify god in doing it romans 12 tells us that listen it says to present yourself bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service god demands your service it's not just up to the preachers it's not just up to brother bowler to be a servant of god and a servant of the people it's up to you and i it's up to each person that says i'm a christian so what are you doing to serve god and serve others i'm gonna move on one writer says it this way he said we worship with an obedient heart and an open and repentant spirit listen to what he says happens god is glorified christians are purified the church is edified the lost are evangelized and these are the elements of true worship man we ought to long for that last soul to come in it ought to be such a spirit of evangelism through worship for others as we worship god that that last soul would come in that the church would be lifted up the church would be edified god was glorified [Music] so i personally believe that god demands i believe he seeks and requests our worship because he deserves it if you know if you really know christ if you really know christ there is a longing in your heart that says god i want to get in that secret place that quiet corner tucked away from the rest of the world and i want to pray i want to praise you i want to worship you i want to get myself into a place that i'm slowed down and all of my thoughts all of my mind all of my heart everything that's within me as i'm putting it on you as americans as americans we generally don't see people bowing down to idols right does your neighbors have buddha in the yard or muhammad a statue that they're bowing down to no they don't have that but in america when in america we've got money we've got success we got physical beauty sex health fitness safety security recreation drugs alcohol music sports figures that's tough on a young person because they begin to look at sports figures be careful what you look at how many knows who the greatest basketball player ever lived was number 23 michael jordan i'll give you that number 23. it's not another 23 it's the 23. he's known to be the greatest basketball player in most people's minds that ever lived and it's easy for kids to look up to him and want to be like him and want to smile like him dunk like him be like him if i could be like mike y'all remember that commercial years ago let me tell you i watched a documentary about michael jordan his teammate said he was the worst teammate they've ever played with he cussed them he abused them he actually hit somebody in the nose one time because he missed a shot and said if you ever miss another shot like it will be more to come is that who you want to be no we see the glitch the glamour the dunks the notoriety but let me tell you these people we're worshiping the wrong things that's not what we're looking around to worship you know what we choose what we worship we choose what we organize our lives around we choose what we put first we choose what we seek above all else and that's what we worship everybody wants to be successful right and that's great god wants you to be successful but are you worshiping that success god wants you to be happily married and you should adore your wife but are you worshiping your wife more than you do god vice versa husband your kids are the greatest things that god can give you outside of your wife i think i love my kids i love my boys i'm proud of them i could just go on and on about them but do i worship them i got to be careful you got to be careful we've all got to be careful what are we worshiping think about this by nature you know what by nature you know what we are worshipers of ourself worshipers of ourself we begin to seek our own welfare our own happiness we begin to seek the the greatness and the goodness in life so when that happens that god given the god-given drive to worship that's in the believer is perverted that worship that god placed in there and said draw to me it then turns to draw to ah and then it's turned upside down and your universe begins to get turned upside down so tonight i don't have to tell you that you need to worship i just need to ask you what you're worshiping what are you worshiping what are you drawing close let's get close to jesus let's put god first listen to saint john 4 19 what jesus told the woman at the well in samaria you know the story brother branham hit it many times talking about you have five wives the one you're living with now is not yours and so on and when he told her that she said sir i perceive thou art a prophet and she said our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place that men are to worship and jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and is and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him that's why it's so important that we follow the true word and message of the hour because god is seeking such a person that with worship and spirit of truth and worship him and this woman was so astounded she knew immediately and said i know that the messiah cometh because of what he said about her worshiping and how the worship would be so what does it mean it means god doesn't care about where you worship what kind of building you're worshiping and it don't matter if you're in the mountains it don't matter if you're in jerusalem it don't matter if you got a thousand dollar suit on god don't care but what god does cared about care about as if you appear to be devout sincere and pious the pharisees the sadducees dressed in the best of clothes looked the part they played the part they spoke the part but it was all a fake it was all a fake so god won't be food comes from the inside because if it's just on the outside like i said on this flesh it's empty and worthless to god he don't like fake worship i'm going to paraphrase here isaiah 29 these people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me that's not what god wants the only kind of worshiper god can use is the ones that worship from here we keep going back to here it's got to be from here sometimes you've seen it and you know it you've done it i've done it you're singing the songs of praise but your heart's as cold as ice are you lukewarm you're not worshiping you're just singing a song yeah i don't want somebody to say he's a singer and i tell everybody i'm not a singer but i'm a worshiper i can't sing a lick i get off key my voice cracks i go here there sometimes i can't get up but if i sit behind sister johnny she'll probably tell you i'm singing i'm doing something i'm worshiping it may hurt her ears but god's loving it god don't care if you're off-key god don't care if you know how to sing he wants you to put forth some effort and sacrifice he wants you to say i love you god i'm going to give everything to you during this hour of praise you know how it is your body's here your mouth is moving your face is smiling you're clapping and nothing you're not engaged with god you're not engaged with him it's like you just went out there and started your truck revving it up you ain't going nowhere until you pull it down into gear and engage the transmission we have to engage the transmission we have to be able to get close to god because if not the next thing you know you're sitting there and you find the sermon is boring y'all quiet hey i've been up here and i've been out there and i know i know how it goes the sermon's boring it's tedious it's my tone you can't wait for that preacher to get done is he ever going to say let's stand i think he's done i think he's about to finish now he's got two more quotes i'm ready to go home brother you ever seen this the watchers brother brown said it's separating time just made god sick at his stomach man i don't want to be guilty of that i don't want nothing i don't want god to ever look at me and say dad you make me sick can you imagine it would hurt you if somebody come up to you personally and you knew and they just come up to you said you know what you make me sick what if god did that i don't want to be guilty of making god sick but listen what he says he said it's the joy unspeakable and full of glory how old saints of god used to sit around and sing redemption songs and sing of the blood and the power of god and today we're cold as zero listen now he says you don't see their faces light up you don't see their faces light up no more and you don't see them sing and clap their hands they don't raise their hands to god they don't praise god they don't pray all night they don't lay in the cornfields man we're not trying to be fanatical please don't misunders listen and and take me there we're not trying to be fanatical but we have to do a little better with praising god we have to do a little better to give god what is duly his so you say how do i fix that how do i fix that i've got it you fix it by not coming to church at 10 30 on sunday morning it was quiet brother help me you fix it by not not waiting till 10 30 on sunday morning to get ready for worship let me tell you it takes at least a half an hour just to get one warmed up to get your mind set on god it takes at least half an hour that's why the prophet said to come to church early 20 30 minutes before and pray and read and meditate and get ready for the worship of god we've all been guilty i've been guilty but let me tell you if i want if i want to get closer to god i can't wait till 10 30 to get ready to praise god and worship god it takes you 30 minutes to get your mind off the bills it takes you 30 minutes for you women to get rid of the attitude where your husband says something to you last night that you didn't like it takes 30 minutes for your husbands to get over the burnt toast you had for breakfast it's the truth and if anything's going to happen to aggravate you when's it going to happen sunday morning sunday morning cows never get out except on sunday morning i quit having cows i'm tired of chasing cows on sunday morning it takes more than 30 minutes just to clear the fog out of our mind and to get ready for the preaching of the word so what do we do what do we do don't wait till you arrive at church to start preparing for worship get up a few minutes early on sunday and pray you say well that's my day rest five o'clock every morning during the week and the weekends i would sleep in that's not your day of rest it's your day of worship week half sunday god god asked us at this church by the by by what is said here the guidelines that we come from maybe two hours a day two and a half three hours on a sunday once a week and wednesday night for a couple of hours is that too much to ask no i don't think so you remember calvary don't you that was a lot to ask for but coming to church a few nights a week not a lot to ask for so get up early read a psalm listen to some worship music start the process a couple of hours ahead of time and get yourself motivated and ready to worship god and say god i know know exactly what what i need from you today but i know you do i know god that you can come down and speak to my heart lord i'll i'm going to ask and i'm going to commit myself for the rest of this day for you to speak to me so that i can give back to you if you do that it'll transform your worship experience if you do that you'll live a different kind of life on sunday god will speak to you in ways you've never been spoken to yeah but you know what you don't have to wait till sunday you can start on saturday night what would you what would happen if we started everybody in this building started meditating on the word and praying and dedicating and committing ourselves to god on saturday night for a sunday morning service what would happen it's a wonder isn't it because we don't know let me ask you this what would happen if every day of the week we prayed for sunday morning service if every day of the week we meditated we prayed we played music we listened we asked god we talk to god we commune with god and then see what he would have for us on sunday morning what do you think would happen it would transform your worship it would transform this church and we would go to places you've never seen before you say man he's put a lot of pressure on us what would happen if the preacher didn't prepare for service what did brother baller come in here on sunday morning and say well i want to sleep in a little bit this morning i think i'll just go here at 10 30 walk out here and say this is what we're going to talk about today what do you think that was let me tell you it'd be chaos because he wouldn't be in tune the preacher's got to be in tune with god he's got to dedicate himself and get into a quiet place and seek what god would have for the people romans 12 i want to read the second verse we've read the first one earlier and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what that is good and acceptable and perfect will of god so we've talked about some fleshly things we've talked about our heart where does that leave our mind where does that leave our mind because we sometimes take for granted the power of our mind our mind is one of the most powerful things in the universe so why you know that's why brother branham says the greatest battle ever fault is between our ears because it's a constant battle going on in our minds and our mind is telling you you're right or you're wrong or you're this or you're that and without your mind being in the right place how can you focus on god has anybody ever had something on your mind and you can't sleep for two or three hours and you're dead tired but you lay there and you lay there and you lay there because you can't get off your mind and you're running scenarios through your mind and through your mind over and over you're trying to fix problems that don't even exist in your mind it'll cause you not to eat it'll cause you not to sleep it'll cause you to to be depressed the mind is a powerful thing i've been reading a book it's a it's got about 13 or 14 mental coaches that coach college and pro athletes in baseball and i've been reading how these guys approach the mind of the baseball game and reading in this i look and they say that what separates the player from the professional player is their mental game so there's thousands and thousands and thousands of players that play baseball and out of these thousands and thousands of players other sports basketball any sport you want to name there's a lot of people thousands of them that are talented enough or skilled enough are genetically built and able and strong enough to play at the professional level but you know how many make it one percent you know why they can't make it it's all here they've got everything it takes to be one of the greatest players ever but mentally they can't focus mentally they can't get into the game mentally they can't hit the ball mentally they can't can't do make the plays mentally they can't shoot the basketball mentally they can't hit the golf shot so what does that mean to the christian this is what they say okay i'm talking i'm talking sports but i'm gonna bring it down to our lives they say that when a pitcher a professional pitcher pitches in a game he's throwing a baseball average nowadays professional probably 90 miles an hour okay that's probably the average 90 miles an hour your eyes have one millisecond to adjust to the pitch and see if you can hit it that's quick but that pitcher before he delivers every pitch in his mind he's not looking at the mitt he's not looking at the batter he's not looking at the coach he's looking in his mind and seeing the picture of the baseball and the path it takes to get to where it's got to go he sees it from his hand to the mitt he's mentally focused he's so in tune with what he's doing in his mind he's going to physically place that ball in the mid the batter has got one millisecond to make a decision is it's a curveball or a fastball can i hit it is it a strike is it high is it low but in his mind he's thinking see the ball hit the ball in tune with what they're doing so what does that mean for the christian it means that when you're listening to a message tune in to that message focus on that message when that then you're into an act of worship because then you've committed yourself once that picture lets the ball go he's committed to where it flies commit yourself to the word when you're so into when you hear the word when you're praying commit to praying these mental coaches they say a baseball player is a lot of things when he's in school he's a student so he should be 100 focused on being a student when he's in the game when he's hitting he's 100 mentally focused on hitting he's not a student anymore he's 100 focused on hitting when he's in the field he's 100 focused on being a fielder he's not a hitter anymore he's not a student anymore so why wouldn't we when we're praying why wouldn't we say i'm going to focus 100 on this prayer i'm going to focus and dedicate 100 on this prayer an act of worship you know worship's not always singing and in our minds we think that because it's songs of praise and worship but there's more to worship you can engage your mind with scriptures as an act of worship you can discuss a sermon or message with your husband or wife as an act of worship there's many ways to worship god i've got one last illustration that i want to speak on focus how focused we are and how in tuned we are is how close we can be with god and we don't want to miss the mark there was a story i read about some scientists that were uh doctors they were sports and now or sports scientists whatever but they want to see how how important the mind was in anything they do so they picked a guy that throws darts you know the guys you throw the darts and tournaments you know hits the bullseye we all know we're talking about right okay so this guy's a professional dart thrower and he could sit up there and throw darts right-handed all day long and hit the bullseye but they told him they said what we want you to do is take a hundred darts left-handed and we want you to throw left-handed so he threw a hundred darts left-handed and he put them in a circle they said i seen the guys video in a circle about this big and they said now we don't want you to touch a dart for a month we don't want you to touch for a month but every day we want you to spend 15 minutes and we want you to see that dart leaving your hand and hitting the bullseye 15 minutes every day for a month so that's what he did he dedicated himself for 15 minutes every day to see that dart hit the bullseye they came back one month later and said we want you to throw 100 darts with your left hand so he stands up boom 100 this time his circle was this big now you tell me the mind is not a powerful thing what do you set your mind on i'm not i'm not up here preaching mind over matter i'm talking about mind focused and dedicated on god how close can we get to hitting a target i don't want to miss the target i don't want to miss the mark in my life i want to make sure that i'm in tune that i'm focused and i'm thinking more on christ and then i'm lifting him up more i'm exalting him more and i'm singing his praises and worshiping god if you do that you're more likely to become more like him if you do that you're more likely to hit the mark that's simple that's simple so don't make it hard don't make this hard don't make living a christian life hard just worship it's that simple do you want to be like christ do you want to have his peace his love his joy his patience his long suffering temperance godliness brotherly kindness holy spirit you want all of that worship let's stand just bow our heads heavenly father lord we thank you lord for this thought you laid on my heart lord and i trust lord that it portrayed itself out appropriately the way that you wanted it to to the people lord lord i hope the message went across clear and loud lord that you are an object to be glorified because you are glory lord that you're an object to be worshipped and that by worshipping lord it makes a commitment into our lives it changes our lives it makes us who you would have us to be lord lord that by worship and praise it fills us with your holy spirit lord it renews the holy spirit it draws us so close and and that we can wrap ourselves in your arms lord there's anybody out here that will just say lord i i i'm not even 50 committed i go through the motions i go to church i pray a little i read a little i sing a little but lord i'm not giving you not giving you near what you do what you deserve if you want to just raise your hand slip it up to god not to me i'm not even looking slip it up to god and say god forgive me lord i want to be a i want to be a worshiper lord of you not of things of this world not of things of this life not of things of the flesh but lord i want my whole heart my whole desire my whole focus is to be on you lord so that we can be overcomers so that we can have more of what you would want us to be lord so that we can serve others as you would have us to serve others as an act of worship [Music] lord we just love you lord jesus just meditate on him softly [Music] let's spend a little time we got time we're in no rush [Music] you
