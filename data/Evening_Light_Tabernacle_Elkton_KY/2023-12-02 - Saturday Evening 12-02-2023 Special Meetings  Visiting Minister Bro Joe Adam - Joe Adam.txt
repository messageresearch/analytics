I don't man you're a new man and you walked in last night one way and come back man the word works I'm just kid I'm just kidding over we greet you tonight again in the name of the Lord for especially honored to be here and you know I've been thinking throughout the day I came many years ago to the ler family and none of them remember me I'm thinking man I must have preached that bad that nobody remembers anything about me being there so let's just hope we change that this weekend let's hope that God has his way and that you know not that we're here to lift our own selves up but but we're we're just feel at home here with the people and we bring you greetings brother Thomas from our pastor brother Tim the church brother Aaron brother Timothy the ministry team there and again it's an hon to be here but what we want to do tonight is we want to we want to turn to the Book of Revelations and it's a very familiar passage for us as Believers Revelations 3 we're going to look at verse 14 and we're going to read down to verse 22 I want to kind of pick back up where we were yet at yesterday but before we do want you're turn in there let's just turn to the Lord in prayer father God we just thank you for this day the fellowship that we've had with brother Thomas and his wife sister Don and the church there at the gym different ones just visiting lord it's so wonderful Lord that we can just be for many miles and hours and States apart and yet Lord we have a commonality Lord and that is your word that is your spirit father for we know we come from God we go back to God and what a joy it is to serve you father we just ask tonight here on a Saturday night in the the middle of Kentucky God that you would just come and make yourself known to us Lord may you just speak the words of life to us tonight and bless each and every one that's in attendance and those that would be on the stream or archive the service later God we're not here to build oursel but we're here to uplift you and we pray father that you would be the fourth man now and you would come and begin to Fan the Flames away father and anoint the lip of your servant to speak only that which you would have anint the ears of the hearer Lord to only hear that which the spirit wants to be heard so Lord we just Commit This Time to you now in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles and you already turned there Revelations 3 and verse1 14 and it says unto the angel of the Church of the leod Deans right that's to us yes come on now each and every one of us here tonight should be able to identify with this passage these things sayith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works so God knows your works and let me just say it like this and God knows when you don't work all right there's one thing to be knowing I'm doing something for God there another thing to be dilatory and lazy God knows thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayth I am rich I am increased with Goods I have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked this is God's description of that person I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rayment thou mayest be clothed and th the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with eyes sand that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and I chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and I will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I have overcome and I sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayith unto the churches God bless you you can have your seats tonight I'm going to go ahead and start my timer so that I'm on time tonight last night we spoke about silence the voice of your enemy but tonight I want to speak to you on listen to The Voice all right not I noticed I didn't say listen to a voice listen to The Voice so we know there's many voices in the land today and we spoke about some of those last night but we want want to be careful that we listen to The Voice let he that hath ear hear what the spirit say to the churches and we find in John 10 verse 27 my keep hear my voice notice that word hear there means to attend to or to consider what is being said or it means to understand it means to perceive the sense of what is being said so we find that sheep hear a lot of voices how many you ever been around sheep bad bad B all them B I mean there's a lot of Racket going on but the Sheep know the voice of the shepherd see they they only hear they only understand they only perceive the voice of the shepherd and and we notice and not only that but the shepherd knows each and every one of his sheep so it's one thing for you to come to the house of God and say I know God but it's another thing for the shepherd almighty God to come down and say I know my sheep I know their voice I know their call I know their situation and understanding tonight church that why would a great Shepherd leave 90 and9 and go to that one lost sheep because that sheep is known other Shepherd he's acquainted with the shepherd the shepherd has raised that sheep the shepherd has looked over that sheep the shepherd has fed that sheep and that's why he's willing to leave is because he got investment into that sheep and God's got investments into you tonight he will leave this church and go out in Elk Kentucky and find that little lamb after braiding and needing of of a saer redeemer he's still going after lost sheep my my my sheep they hear my voice notice they hear a lot of voices come on but they only truly hear the voice of the shepherd that's it that's right see their safety brother Thomas doesn't consist in knowing all the other voices but their safety consist in knowing that all the other voices are not the voice of the shepherd that's why we have to rightly divide the word of God that's why when you come into the house of God and somebody stands behind this pull pit and you can tell if you're a true sheep you can tell if you're a true sheep of what the shepherd is speaking is that the voice of the shepherd or is that the man's voice is he trying to feed you his own idea is he trying to feed you his own Doctrine because the shepherd is going to stay with the word and my sheep will hear my voice see the rest of the voices are strangers but the voice of the shepherd is a Voice of Truth it's a voice of protection it's a voice of safety it's the voice of Life what we find here in John 10 he says my sheep hear my voice but that's not all all he says and I know them the word know here means to be acquainted with to have knowledge of and I spoke about it last night you were in the back part of God's mind God knows you God knew you before the foundation of the world you were a thought in the back part of God's mind so the shepherd knows his sheep God knows who is his and God knows who is not his and that's why I'm telling you tonight it's one thing that you can say I know God or I know a prophet and I know a message but what about God knowing you tonight what about God being acquainted with you tonight what about God saying quit listen to all the other voices and listen to my voice tonight some of you been listening to the voice of Hollywood and the voice of school and the voice of of this ball star and the voice of this game and the voice of this influence but what about the voice that'll transform your body what about the voice that would change dimensions that's the voice that we need to be listening to tonight yes thank you Lord Jes brother Brown tells us then hear ye him he said the Bible is the very thoughts of God that God had before the foundation of the world expressed them in word Dro them down to prophets yes and they wrote them yeah notice he says now that's the only thing it just has to unfold God knows all things and by the spirit of knowledge why God drops it to His prophets as Eagles who sail up in the air and they see things happen before it gets there he says you see he says so God has always had an ordained way like it or lump it God has called man to preach the gospel you may not like his shape you may not like his size you may not like his delivery you may not like his breath I don't care what it is but God has called man to preach the gospel he could have chose anything but God chose man and man's not perfect man's got flaws man's got mistakes man's got vales but yet God is still called man to declare the word of God and the sheep can hear the voice of God through the man I want you to understand that they look Beyond The Vessel they look Beyond the Veil and they hear the voice of God is that the word is that Theus say of the Lord is that in line with the truth does that match up from Paul's day to our day and if it does that's not the voice of a man that's the voice of God to the people I don't need to get ahead of myself cuz well I can right now but I'm G try to slow down notice now we find here that God has always worked through man we find in second Peter 1:2 knowing this first that no prophecy is of of the scripture of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in the old time by the will of man but the holy but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost see I'm not here this evening to speak in my own word but last week when I was alone and I was in prayer for the services God spoke to me and said I need you to preach two Services silence the voice of the enemy and listen to The Voice Voice come on that's right I said well I hadn't preached those thoughts in forever but you know what with God the word is eternal so God knows tonight God knows this weekend it was already pre-planned before brother Thomas and I ever made the arrangements God already predestinated the service he predestinated you to be here he knew the seat that you would be on he knew the attitude in which you would come in and God is declaring if you can put all that aside tonight and hear the voice God has got something special for you so notice he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he said it may be that Millions will hear these words or read them but how many will pay heed to them he said that we do not know but he will lend his ear but he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of truth we'll find the spirit of God enlightening him if you're ear is open to the word the spirit of God will make the word real to you if your ear is open to hear to perceive to earnestly God what do you have for me tonight come on he says then the word will be revealed to you see now he says that is the work of the spirit he goes I can teach you the truth but if you don't open your ear to hear it and your heart to receive it you won't get the Revelation and we spoke about Revelation last night and Revelation is the most important thing that we as Believers can receive come on so he talks about the first age and brother BR said notice we understand that the Ephesian age was a first age ordained by Paul or yeah excuse me Paul and Paul established a church and he wrote the majority of the New Testament but he says now how tragic is it that the first age did not listen to the spirit this is in the Ephesian Church age instead it listened to man yeah all right but thank God in the last AG there will be a group rise up the true Bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross Darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ think about it here they are great Paul's Ministry he established a church the greatest Prophet that maybe outside of William Bramley hit the face of the Earth and God so entrusted in him to establish the church and a mere 30 years after his departure the men of God that followed that Ministry begin to listen to the voice of a man and it got away from the voice of God and it brought them down through destruction and we find that the Ephesian age was an age that was aimed at the things of God but they got relaxed on the word of God they got Dory on the word of God and if we're not careful L to see we'll be the same thing oh I believe God in a prophet oh I believe the mess hour but yet you got things that are taking your attention away from the word and you got relaxed on the things of God and God is calling us back come back to The Voice come back to my word hear the spirit of God hear the voice for this hour Lord 30 years after Paul Ministry we're some 60 years after Brother brandom's come on now 30 years they begin to drift away from that reality from that voice and where are some people sitting today 60 years 60 years and we wonder why we can't keep our young people in church we wonder why some of our young people go off into the world yeah why because where's the voice where's The Voice have we substituted the voice of a prophet for the voice of a man's idea or when we make compromise and we get dilatory we do this and we do that because we're just trying to keep the home in the right atmosphere this word will keep the home in the right atmosphere you just stick with the word of God the word still works Church you apply the token to your family you apply the token to your home you apply the token to your children and the token will do exactly what the token was designed to do you don't have to compromise we don't need Dr Dawson we don't need Psychology we got the word of God for this hour we got the voice of the Angel here you find men of God they substitute and they got psychology now and look let me tell you psychology ain't never saved nobody men who came in on psychology it may have held them 15 years 20 years but eventually they go right back out but you show me somebody you show me somebody that met God on the backside of a desert somebody that had a Pentecostal experience they're still here they're still standing they're still listening for The Voice some of you grandparents here tonight you're here you're here testifying of what I'm talking about you heard that voice and you're still proclaiming it he's still The Voice he's still the one that's right let me just tell we don't have to make excuses for it either that's we don't have to make excuses for the Prophet come on I believe it and that settles it you ain't got to believe it I'm not asking you to that's between you and God but I'll hear the voice and I'm listening to it and I can testify I can tell you what the voice is do for your family he can take somebody like me who was born in a broken home at the age of two my parents theor they were in drugs all my life and I found out that my mom and dad let me just tell you young people when I was about 8 years old my dad stole my brother and I kidnapped us from my mother and we were away from her for about four to five months before we ever got to see her again come on you think well I got a bad upbringing yeah you got a mom you got a dad you got a great church you got a great school you got all these great things but then you got a bad upbringing because you can't do this and you can't do that and you can't do this I could do anything I wanted to do but yet God rich in Mercy I'm going to tell you God rich and Mery I didn't know about God God but God knew about me and I told you last night with the moment I want to take my life The Voice came down the voice came down said turn your car around let me tell you I still been turned around brother Thomas I'm Not Looking Back I'm not going back God has called us and let me tell you a young person it's time that you make your mind up I'm listening to the voicey I'm not going back I'm not turning around I'm going all the way with Jesus Jesus I'm hearing The Voice tonight it's a voice of wisdom it's a voice of knowledge it's a Voice of [Applause] Truth that's good thank you Lord God is good John 5:19 it says a son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for whatsoever thinks he doeth he says these also doeth the son likewise amen and he says in the church a he says now notice the harmony of the father and the son he said Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father he says this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride come on now come on that's right she don't do anything for what her husband the groom shows her that some of you Brothers we know how that is right come on no I better not go there brother Johnson I know you trying to pull it out of me uhhuh we ain't going to go there sometimes our wives make those purchases we didn't know nothing about we're going to move on see notice now he shows her his Word of Life come on she receives it come on somebody you receive that Word of Life brother Joe you received that Word of Life what God done for you turn your life around 17 years out there in the world but God rich in mercy God planted a seed on the inside and you went a long time you seeing it covered it up Satan it covered up but it God's time the voice begin to speak the voice begin to Quicken the seat and now you sit there today not the same man you were 20 years ago you're completely different what am I telling you when you heed to the voice the voice can change your life The Voice will change your life notice he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death boo devil come on somebody don't be all downcast tonight nothing can harm you tonight not even death so I say boo devil I'm a Son of God tonight I'm not listening to your threats I'm not listening to your lies I'm listening to The Voice I'm listening to the voice of my healer I'm listen L to the voice of my savior I'll listen to the voice of my redeemer I listen to the voice of the Holy Ghost filler tonight that's the voice I'm listening [Applause] to notice that he says his word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has dust sayith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in water it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose see the word is in the bride now I just want to understand this that it's not this Bible in the bride it's not the letter that's in the bride but in the beginning was the word the word there means a logos so the logos all all that God was he poured it into Christ and all that Christ was he pours it into his bride so what am I telling you I'm telling you tonight that Christ is in his bride his life is in his bride his authority is in his bride his power is in his bride the miraculous is in his bride the Supernatural is in his bride everything that God was he is here and it's in his bride tonight but if you're not hearing the voice you don't know how to operate cuz you and your home you men you you fathers and you daddies and you husbands you're the leadership of your home you give the instruction and that little wife takes it and receives it and say yes this is how we're going to do cuz see we're not there all during the day we're at work come on but she takes that voice don't you let No Stranger in come on don't let them mailman slide through the door y'all laugh for that later some of y'all some of y'all would never get it but she knows she knows what her husband wants done and she receives it and she performs it notice we find here that in Revelations 2:11 and through every Church age we have the same admonition he that had the uh ear to hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let them hear notice to the angel of every age he starts off he directs the message to the angel and then he ends but let he that hath an ear hear what the spirit sayth now that's not to the Angel that's to the hearer so if we can hear now brother would tell us also he saids now he would take this word God would and he would deposit the word to his Angel and that angel would take that word and break it and begin to reveal it to you and I his subjects and that's what God has done in this hour Church there's never been another Ministry quite like the ministry that we're sitting under in this hour even if it's 60 years later the word is still performing the voice of God is still speaking and sons and daughters are still listening for that voice they're still giving credence for that voice they're still alow in that voice to change their lives so every single age has the same admonition to the people of every age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit say but you know it's absolutely brother R says it's absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit says to the different ages then he begins to look here in 1 Corinthians 2 and and verse 10 says but God hath revealed them unto us by spirit for the spirit searches all things ye the Deep things of God in verse 12 we ex say now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God verse 14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolish unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned then you look here in Matthew 13: 133 therefore speak I to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear and neither do they understand oh my and in verse 15 for this people's heart is waxed gross their ears are dull of hearing their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I shall heal them and then John 8:43 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word so it's not for everybody and I'm gonna go into this again tomorrow Lord willing if my thoughts doesn't change before now and then but brother BR would tell us in the Samaran Church age putting these verses together we see that there is only one group of people and that is a very special group of people oh is that all we get out of that I mean come on we're a very special group of people and we can't shout we can't say Amen we can't say Glory Hallelujah to that God is declaring to you God is drawing distinction tonight showing you tonight it's not for everybody but it's for a very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit is saying to the age not everybody's hearing this [Music] message not everybody did hear this message but it's to a special class a special group of people able to hear what the spirit says to the age he said it is one special group that receives the Revelation for the age and that group is of God because the group that cannot hear is not of God they are the ones who have the spirit of God they are the ones that are born of God they are baptized in the body of Jesus Christ by the spirit they are baptized with the Holy Ghost then he goes on to say he said the church is made up good and bad even right here tonight the church is made up of three kind of Believers okay some of you are shouting great some of you are sleeping not so great but we face it the church is made up good and bad two vins make up the church they are the the wheat and the tears all right and growing up side by side but one is the true the other is the false and he says now God will speak to each one of them he will talk about each one of them he will call them church but only the elect will really know which one is true only the elect will not be deceived only the elect let me tell you that's why some of you get excited that's why some of you can shout that's why some of you can Rejoice because you realize how one of the ones he's talking about I can receive it I have received it it's the voice of the age I'm hear from out the alony I'm he from the Heavenly bridegroom that's why I can shout that's why I get stimulated because I'm catching the revelation of the word of who I [Applause] am do you realize tomorrow morning there's going to be Baptist Churches Methodist churches Pentecostal churches and they going to shout some of them are going to shout because the rain's going to fall come on come some of them are going to shout some of them are going to get happy much happier than some of you are tonight because the rain is gonna fall and they're nothing but tears and if the tears can get excited about the word Paul what about the week getting excited what about the True Vine getting excited about the word the Heavenly Host coming down and anointing the people and the people receiving it it should make you shout it should make you jump it should make you glorify God why cuz you recognize you're hearing the voice and it ain't the voice of a man it's a voice of almighty God it's only to the elect man I love that well that ain't fair fair fair no fair I'm the elect you Tak it over God K the revelation of who you are but Satan has been in your ear oh well you're not the bride look at this we talked about that last night you got to silence the voice of the enemy how do you do that brother Joe by listening to the voice of God by listening brother will tell us now in the of Jesus Christ he said the Book of Revelation has more symbols in it than all the rest of the books of the Bible it has more symbols because it is a book of Prophecy it's a prophetic book come on therefore it has to be understood by a prophetic Class come on now come on somebody I know we live in Kentucky but you still can get excited about that you may feel like you're dumber than a block of rocks but it don't matter you are a prophetic class of people only the prophetic class can receive the Revelation that lays in the book of God only the prophetic class can hear from the voice of God oh the prophetic class can put it all together because it ain't their intelligence it ain't their ideas it ain't their doctrines it ain't their Traditions it's all might of God coming down and putting it all together for them and giving them eyes that they can see and giving them ears that they can hear it's a prophetic class and I preach it I preach it to you tonight you are that prophetic class you are that special group you are that elect lady tonight that can hear the voice of God that can witness to the voice of God that he is the same he is the same God just as much as he was in 1964 65 43 it don't matter he is still as much God tonight and in Kentucky as he was on the shores of Galilee you are that elect Church you are that brid tree prophetic class you know I'm glad God ain't God ain't trying to to measure Us by our IQ all right praise God cuz some of us got great IQs some of us can't even spell IQ thank God he ain't he a we ain't resting on that you know just G can I be honest with you can I just be a little transparent you know what I enjoy this word come on I love I thrive on it but I get around other ministers and I I sat back brother Thomas and I'm quiet as a mouse cuz I just can't bring it up like that they Bam Bam man quote scripture quote scripture I'm going so God ain't he is not about how much we can spit out how much we can recite how much we know but let me tell you when God I step behind this Pulpit I'm not relying on my Humanity I'm not relying on my intellect I'm relying on the anointing of the Holy Ghost and he can quicker this word because God knows what your needs are God knows what your desires are God knows what the situations are and God has a voice for you tonight that he is the voice of your healing he is the voice of your children he is the voice of your church he is still the voice in this hour and ain't no devil of Hell going to drown out that voice but we were going to silence the voice of the enemy and let the voice of God be lifted up thank you Lord notice my my might let me open this will you open it for me we taged team help me out a little bit come on notice here in Christ the mystery God revealed you can take drink you want all right amen it's been 20 years for me to get here I'm gonna preach I've been waiting on this moment for a long time amen notice Christ The Mystery of God revealed he told Eve don't you do that don't do that don't do this and don't do that you can do this and you can't do that so God set the boundaries in the Garden of Eden you can eat of all the trees but there's one tree that you need to stay away from see you can go on the internet you look at everything you want to but there's a couple SES you don't need to go to that's right come let's just put it where it is come only apply to young boys that applies to young girls as well you find here that he he set the boundaries but Satan said oh well come on you're alone nobody's gonna know nobody's G to see it it's just me and you we're just here it's just us mom and dad are away the computer's wide open on yeah that's right come on think about it Eve you'll be as a God knowing good and evil my you would know how reproductive takes place how life comes forth you'll be able to bring forth life like all these other creatures and brother BR would say and Satan said oh you know but she turned around and listened to him but the eve of this last day come on now come on now come on Eve the eve of this last day he said she ain't going to do it the EV this last day she ain't going to listen to the voice of the deceiver the EV this last day she's heard the word of her father the word of her bride group and she ain't going all wandering around way without Adam but she's going to stay with her Adam she's going to stay with her groom she's going to stay with the word word that's right you find Satan in the garden T then got Eve to fall and got Adam take of it now they're falling they got fig leaves on hiding their wondering you know hi herself from God and Satan's told her H look at this God in your Eden in this place that you have crafted that you have perfect you call it Perfection think about this here it was this is Adam he was your first or your highest form of creation and he was perfect and here's this Garden it's perfect and now you you pulled out Eve from out of Adam and she's perfect but yet let me just tell you God in your eeden I got them to fall and say saying Lord in your eating I got them to listen to my voice Lord in your Perfection I caus them to sin in your Perfection I brought death in your Perfection I brought perversion in your Perfection I spoil your plans but all let me tell you God just sat there and he kind of smoked a little bit he said oh that's all right because God plan God had in his mind he had the attributes to be a redeemer he had the attributes of being a savior he had the attributes of being a Holy Father and every day God looked at and he knew there was going to come a to in the seventh age he was going to handle the people and Satan's e God said look at that in your own need in your own creation I'm calling that a bride in your own creation you can make it better you can make it awful you can make it as simple as you want but you're own I'm calling out the and going to listen to my voice oh Hallelujah tonight I of Satan he's calling forth the body of [Applause] Christ re God has prepared you you can't fall on

what nothing happened in my way and why God hadn't blessed me or this that no I was thinking God God thank you for the moment God thank you for this touch God thank you for the word god thank you for

filled up going to tell tell you something he says now I'm a real Baptist so he's setting a sage for you I'm a real look I got a good buddy of M he's a real Baptist he our probably best friends and I that's a that's a paradox me being a best friend with a Baptist preacher but in our good friends we know our boundaries I'm going tell you that he said I got so full of the Holy Ghost until I set my gun against a tree I run around that tree just as hard as I could kicking up one foot wow come on he was kicking up a foot this is your prophet and he went around and around and around that tree shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he's I come back around and I shout Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah he's just as hard as I can run he goes I almost fell down well that's just nonsense you're just getting in the flesh he almost fell down that's your Prophet let me ask you a question how many you in flesh tonight oh some are scared well I'll just tell you what this flesh did today this flesh woke up at 7 o'clock this morning brushed his fleshly teeth cuz it nasty breath after sleeping all night this flesh put on some some decent clothes and got ready this flesh got him a bite to eat this flesh drank some coffee this flesh studied for several hours this flesh drove to brother Thomas's house and this flesh tonight this flesh tonight drove to the house of God day you can't help but get in the flesh so you might as well get in the flesh in the house of God and give God something to anoint tonight and allow the Holy Ghost to come down and strike that seed that's on the inside cuz you hear it not from the voice of a man but you hear it from almighty God tonight it's okay to jump it's it's okay to shout it's okay to run around it's okay to shout hallelujah and glory to God if you're hearing the voice [Applause] he said if somebody would have come in him wood they have thought they had a maniac in there oh man I'd have been scared to go on there and some of y'all scared to come to the house of God all that shouting all that carrying on let me just tell you a quick testimony it ain't much of a testimony we had a a tremendous meeting me several years ago at our church backing up we go to Oklahoma Youth Camp and this young girl came up in the Prine brother Timothy was preaching that week that time was one of the first camp meetings that brother Wendell did and and this young girl came up and I picked it up like that now I'm not saying I'm super spiritual but I went over brother te I say it's a spirit of suicide that's on this girl right here and uh she she know she come up for prayer and she just come up and they prayed with her but and then she kind of stayed there and I'm like something's not right this girl needs Deliverance this girl seeking for for God and and I just said brother Timothy I said this a spirit of suicide and we got to deal with it well we begin to pray and we begin to deal with this young girl but you know you almost get a breakthrough but you don't there's times God has a a an appointed time for every situation so that was sometime around March but then it came to our October meetings at October and this young girl came her and her grandmother that came to the October meetings and she was moved on by the spirit of God and there was a prayer line that formed little prayer line here prayer line there me and brother Aaron oasby we went out and we begin to work a prayer line right there in the middle of the aisle and the spirit of deser begin to hit and I begin to call that thing out Bam Bam Bam Bam and that girl just begin to crumble cuz that spirit of suicide begin to lift off of her and she found her way to the altar begin to cry out to God begin to throw her hands up and she's come from a broken home come from a bad life and yet here she was having her moment with God and her grandmother was sitting right there about the second row and at the end of the Ser she come and got her and said get up from there you don't act like this we didn't do this when I was your age Lord now that young girl is out in the world but grandmother's okay Grandma Grandma bad right but what I'm saying if she was having her breakthrough and it may not be the way you got it all figured out it may not happen the way it was when you was a young person my goodness Fred Flintstone and Barney Flintstone they still trying to figure out how you was acting back then some of y'all get that tomorrow too but because it didn't happen the way she thought it should happen snatched that little girl up that spirit of suicide Left her but then because of that moment it be to come back on her now she's out in the world I don't know any reports on her but I'm just telling you it may not be the way that we have it all figured out because we're finite we're different all of us here not one of us here tonight are going to line up in the same ideas and the same strategems in any particular way we may get a few things that we agree on but we're never going to agree 100% that's why we're not trusting in our own voice but we're trusting in the voice of God he's the infinite one he's got it all figured out he knows the end from the beginning church he knows all the way through it he knows your UPS he knows your Downs he knows your sicknesses he knows your healings he knows your deliverance he knows everything about you tonight and if you will stay with that voice God will bring it right on through church and you're going to prosper in the Lord yes thank you Lord notice now if a prophet could Rejoice because he saw God in nature can't we Rejoice because we see God in his word can't we Rejoice because we see God in his people can't we Rejoice because we see God in our children yes I got four kids and they love the Lord I'm going tell you what I Rejoice that I got four kids that love the Lord they love God's Church look I go all over the place and we try to take our kids they're like look can we just stay home we just love our church I'm like y'all don't like my [Applause] preaching but they love the house of God they love their youth group they love their preaching the ministry there they love it look I couldn't ask for anything better God rich in Mercy and if you got young people tonight that Lord the Lord and want to come to the house of God you got a right to Rejoice because they're not hearing from a man they're not hearing from you but they're hearing from God and God has struck those heartstrings and they're listening they got a desire for the things of God they should make you excited grandmother Mom Dad Papa why because your children Generations are still here on the front line serving almighty God giving God their own hearing those young girls right there just sing that song man that excites me let my Jesus change your life how many how old are you what's the youngest girl how old is she six years old singing for god well we didn't sing when I was 6 years old well I don't care come on my goodness Man 6 years old singing for the Lord 10 years old singing for the Lord young people singing for the Lord giving their gifts to the Lord what Satan's doing everything he can to take that gift out in the world they going to make Nashville they going to hit the big time I'm tell there ain't no bigger time to hid in the house of God in the real of Eternity when you're going to be dancing on streets made with Go singing and reing and giving God praise cuz you heard the voice of God I can't help it cuz you you need some bingay and some other stuff to loosen up those joints drink a Red Bull come to church let's have fun I enjoy church yes look some of y'all how many of y'all watch our streams yeah maybe a handful of y'all I act this way when I'm sitting on the back come on yeah this ain't just put on that's right my wife will tell you I didn't grow up Pentecost everybody when I first had that thought I was Pentecostal shouting and dancing and jumping brother brother Josh said I got me some new shoes is that's when you started doing the 360s man I wish it was shoes I'd have put them on a long time [Applause] ago it makes it a little bit easier though brother Josh man a little bit lighter a little bit more cushion when you land let me keep preaching amen notice now he says The Seven Ages is set forth in Revelations chapter 2 through3 we know that that pertains to or pertains to the church ages see taking the whole span of the fullness of the Gentiles or the whole time in which God is dealing with the Gentiles on salvation in every single age Bar None it says that the very same thing in the opening and closing of the message he changed unto the messenger of Ephesus samna pergamus Tara Sardis Philadelphia Le oia write these things sayith etc etc he that hath an ear let him him Singler hear what the spirit sath to the churches not notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself only to one person relative to the work for that age come only one messenger for each age excuse me receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is a messenger to the church age yeah he speaks for God's by Revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but though it's broadcast for all whom come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way W that's rich man that's rich he says now those who here are not getting their own private Revelation nor is a group getting a their Collective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God that's why the prophet of God will say say What's on the takes don't put your own ideas to it don't put your own Traditions to it say what the tape say that's where it is why because you're not getting your own private interpretation you're not getting a collective interpretation but they're saying the very same thing that the messeng receive from the voice of God they're saying the same thing that he says that's right so with that being said I have a question for you why is there a Thunder Group yeah why is there a peruja group why is there a two group in a return camp why we have all these different Revelations if we're to hear from the voice and it's the same voice from the same messenger who got it from God Almighty and we're listening to that voice how do we have all these different factions within the message it tells me that somebody is not hearing the voice of God but they g off they heard something it may be not in oper truth but the devil's injected something there and they going off on the seed on this idea and the seed on that idea but the true bride the True Church of the Living God she's not going to go on that idea she's gonna stay with the voice of God Only One messenger come on now in England there's Elohim in South Africa there's a Holy Ghost men claiming to be Elohim men claiming to be the Holy Ghost himself men claiming to be the eighth messenger well in order to be the eighth messenger you just did everything away with Book of Revelations because there's only seven so if we're listening to The Voice young people hear me because you may hear this stuff preached way out there and it may have a lot of truth to it but if it don't line up with the Bible if it don't filter through the message of the hour it's not the voice of God it's got to line up all the way through that's why the prophet of God said preach it Gun Barrel straight and stay with what's on those tapes you hear a lot of people well brother bam said this and brother bam said that and you go back and you try to find a brother didn't say nothing about it come on no this done here say pass down this one said it this one said it this one said it and maybe he may have mentioned something around a campfire hunting trip but if it ain't on those tapes don't you hang your soul on something that you can't back it up [Applause] with man put their own idea to that's right true and here's the thing Church prophet of God preach but Paul preach yes he Jonathan brother Thomas brother different ministers here how many ministers we got here tonight come on raise your hands don't be ashamed I mean we preach a good gospel what's your name brother H pH here's your last name Bon treer nice to meet you we preaching the same message Paul preached let me just tell you it works it worked in Paul's day it works in our day yes I was preaching a youth meeting long time ago brother Thomas my daughter was nine years old my oldest this about 11 years ago I said brother window Martins I was preaching on a fresh experience thirsting for the things of God my nine-year-old little girl lawen she's a very conservative very sweet little girl and me and her we didn't have a it's an odd deal because we didn't really have a real good relationship she always went to her mama maybe because Papa looks scary I don't know maybe so I took her and a group of kids up I was preaching this you weekend and leadings there for brother Wendell and I begin to preach and at the end of that service man the power of God hit and Holy Ghost fell and there was a bunch of kids at the altar my little Lauren was at the altar snotting and crying and received the Holy Ghost at 9 years old let me tell you why she didn't hear from Daddy the Holy Ghost wasn't mind to give her but she heard from almighty God and God came down and look me and her got a great relationship to me and her like that brother Thomas we buds because we got a connection then I had the privilege of leading my my daughter Rebecca and my youngest daughter Caroline to the Lord at the same time in the same night and then several months later during Co I baptize him in the same service my God that's wonderful why because I'm preaching not my own idea I'm not preaching Tim PR religion I'm not preaching Donnie Reagan religion I'm not preaching Thomas Bor religion I'm not preaching Joseph Hammond religion I'm not teach preaching R Spencer religion I'm preaching Paul's gospel I'm preaching that same gospel that was instituted several thousand years ago and if it worked then it works today Church don't you dissect it don't you compromise just stay with that anointed word it'll bring the same results it'll produce the same signs it'll produce the same wonders every yes sir says if you are a Christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age and Paul will say If any man preach any other gospel than what they what what what you have received let him be a cursed that's right so brother bam they said hey he went beyond the curtain of time he said what about Paul he said he said will Paul be there he said Paul and his group will be there he says well good cuz I'm preaching exactly what Paul's preaching right so brother Thomas you and your group will be there because you're preaching the same thing Paul's preaching that's right brother Jonathan you and your family and those that you get to preach to Brother Brad brother Phillip you're going to preach to and they're going to be there because why you're preaching the same word that Paul preached that Wesley preach that Martin preach that Luther preach that Iranian oh come on somebody you're preaching the same word that William Brandon preached it's the same and it will bring the same results cuz it's not the voice of a man but it's the voice of God it's going to bring the same results every time notice the Bible will tell us that the spirit in the bride say come no the bride is not saying something contrary to the husband no the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing you want a dysfunctional home let the wife go against the husband all right don't agree too loud he might get in trouble we may have to have marriage C back here when it's over with but you let a husband and wife disagree yeah that's right it don't only affect their marriage it affects their kids yeah it's so much T rolling at home with the husband and wife are not on the same page they can't agree maybe he's too powerful to say I'm sorry don't look at me like you bunch of cheriff ain't never had a fight in your house come on ain't never had an arue I've been married for 40 years yeah you [Applause] liar my wife and I've only had two major arguments I don't remember them she don't either but we just counted it two just cuz that's hey two for 20 years is pretty good but you know I could be bullheaded that's a Kentucky word right bullheaded stubborn yeah sometimes you want to dig your heels in you don't want to apologize you know you know you're in the wrong come on somebody at least agree with me you know you wrong but you too stubborn too PR to say honey I'm sorry you go to bed all stuffed up and I ain't saying nothing on somebody needs it so I'm just going to preach it anyway all stuffed up she's in the kitchen and you don't went to bed all covers are all hot because you done steamed yourself to sleep next morning that same Spirit still there because look you got to apologize come on he said brother you doing this too good cuz I've been on the receiving end yeah that's I realized you know what this ain't benefiting me this ain't benefiting my wife this ain't benefiting my kids this ain't benefitting our home honey I'm sorry and just those few words honey I'm sorry completely changes the atmosphere kids ain't walking on eggshell wondering mama's going to throw some or Daddy's going to throw some we don't throw anything just I'm just putting that in there it makes the story a little bit better right but they know they can sense it you don't want your kids scared you want your kids to see a good home the harmony that exists between a husband and a wife yeah and if you're listening to the voice of God yes and you're not listening to your own ideas I got to have this biggest struggles in a marriage and I'm giving marriage cancer I'm not even a pastor is finances man she got a hold of that checkbook and do some damage and you get a hold of that credit card can do some damage before you know it y'all fighting and fussing and acting the ways you should but if we can hear the voice of God and come into Unity yes and say God I'm sorry wife I'm sorry husband I'm sorry help me to be a better Steward of my time help me to be a better Steward of my relationship help me to be a better Steward of my home and G be a better Steward of my finances I want to hear that voice one day we're gonna get there and he's gonna say Well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord but if we're all caught up in our own self always got to be right you know brother B said I'd rather be right in my spirit and wrong in my Doctrine he'd rather be right in his spirit because see he can fix his Doctrine but if you're wrong in your spirit you can cause a lot of damage abely and I'm not saying that ain't none of us ever been wrong in our spirit at times but thank God we're quick to repent we're quick the Zeal of the hour is to repent and say Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry that I didn't have the right attitude I'm sorry Lord that you know a lot of times we look at the preacher and you know maybe he ain't our favorite preacher come on go ahead you know short and dumpy I ain't looking at you I ain't looking at you either I'm looking at me short and dumpy but I'm cute so it don't matter he short and dumpy all they want to be not everybody can be Andrew Glover tall dark and [Laughter] handsome I don't know where I was going I just to myself completely off track we better keep on going but see God has called all of us to hear the voice of this hour and there's only one voice and if the ministry the fivefold ministry is lined up to the word it'll be speaking the same voice that's why we can't give into push play and Obey is because that doesn't line up with the word that doesn't line up with look Paul didn't establish the fivefold ministry God Almighty established the fivefold men for the edifying of the body cuz see some of you you like teaching some of you like pastorship some of you like preaching some of you like evangelism we all are different nature so God put it all in five different types of Ministries so that it'll feed not only the children but it'll feed the grandchildren yeah it'll feed the grandparents it'll feed those old ones and all they want is that old time religion what God's got it packed right there in the Bible and maybe next month next week sometime next year God will send somebody in here and it'll be the right kind of ministry that you like and you can feed on it but let me tell you it's still got to be the voice of God but sometimes we get so caught up in the vessel especially when you get close to the vessel yes you know you get close to me you going to realize I'm human yes that's right I'm human that's the truth I'm not a robot you're not a robot I'm not perfect you're not perfect but you find if you get so close and you begin to know that person a little bit more intricate than maybe what you normally would then when you sit there and he's preaching and because you know these little things sometimes Satan will sit there and make it hard for you to receive yeah yeah makes it hard you to receive because you're listening to the voice of a man versus the voice of God yeah that's it but if you can push past the veil push past to humanity push past his mistakes and his flaws you know and recognize that we're everyone's the same and realize if I can push past that and I can hear what the spirit is saying yes and if I can hear tonight what the spirit wants out of this service then I can hear the voice of God it may not be little 5 foot 6 actually I'm 5 foot five and a half I don't tell nobody I lost a whole inch last year I went to the doctor after I quit my job or retired or whatever you want to call it and had to go get insurance she measured me brother Thomas almost cried I've been 5' six and a half all my life all of a sudden I was 5' five and a half she goes we just going to call you 5 foot 6 I said well bless your heart I'll take it I lost a whole inch but she gave me a half an inch back that made my day you try being 5 foot five and a half it ain't fun y'all some tall people in that lter family man every last one of y'all tall and big y'all ain't Little People sure y' ain't part of that Anakin group no I'm kidding I'm just teasing I just wish I could be tall yeah that's a dream I have every now and then being tall notice let me go on my goodness my wife saying boy would you please stop we're GNA bring this baby home we're going to land this airplane we like brother je for we about to parachute out all right we're gonna Land This Plane here in just a minute so there's so many voices there we discuss there's a voice of politics you know 60 years ago America America voted in their first Democratic or First Catholic President and now we got almost a entire political system is full of Catholics so Protestants make up 55% of the seats of the House and Senate because there's so many different factions of the Protestant religion in the house the Catholic religion makes up the majority that's in the house and the Senate our supreme court system is almost 99% Catholic and now we got a president that's Catholic so you hear the voice of liberalism that's being produced throughout the land you hear you see laws being passed because it's the voice of the enemy that's going forth little by little and then you young people you got Hollywood the voice of Hollywood like I spoke about last night Disney and their new movie Pauline where a young girl who has one night stand with the devil and is pregnated with his kid these are voices and they're trying to desensitize you to the things of God so that you will not hear the voice that's being preached in the house of God see Hollywood films glorify sex violence attracting or attacking the moral values of all societies and they try to to pray on the young people because they know that's the generation and now you find that now there's laws being passed in some states to where you cannot tell your kid that they're boy or girl male or female you have to wait till they get to a certain age and let them decide look that decision was made in heaven that was already made God formed him and fashion him the way he wanted them but yet you hear that voice coming in this hour but the true church she's going to hear the voice of God she's going to heed to the voice of God so in closing I want the musicians if you just make your way back you've been a wonderful group to preach to but but B said there's going to come a time that when your wandering Soul have been taken from your body and this destination somewhere wandering Yonder in darkness and either into the bosom of God the voice will speak again the Bible said that all those that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come out some shall come out to Everlasting shame and contentment others shall come out to Everlasting peace and joy but think about it tonight church just for a few moments now maybe you're here tonight and and you've been giving credence to all these other voices some of you may have may have listened to the voice of depression just play something soft if you would please maybe you're here and you've been given into to the voice of discouragement right anxiety is overwhelmed you nervousness has taken you and back of your mind the voice of suicide is just sitting right there just just take your life just do it end it right now nobody's going to miss you you won't even be missed [Music] and I'll share something with you and I shared this not too long ago at our church I had a very stressful job and I got into a very dark place a low place I wouldn't say dark but a very a very low moment in my my walk with the Lord and not that I was back sitting because I wasn't I was still a preacher of the gospel and uh but we had our special meetings many years ago and and and brother Ron Spencer was there and he preached a message jealousy at the altar and I went to that service and you know you you get jealous of this guy and that guy maybe he's getting preached more you're not getting preach enough and you got all these you know the the the the politics of churches and who's who's and all that and if you're not careful you can get worked up in that and you're listening to the wrong voice yeah and I brother Thomas I'm just being honest it's transparent with you begin to listen to the wrong voice like why don't the Lord use me you know I'm ready but yet my job was so stressful that it just kept me and my wife can testify kept me in a very low place and hey praise God a year and a half ago I became a brand new man yeah but one night we went to that service that night and I drove I had to work late probably till 7 o'clock and I drove there and just in that you know you just get in a funk I maybe y'all use that word here funk you know you're just in a cloud you're in dark place seems like nothing's going right you can't see God and you can't hear God and you definitely ain't hearing the voice of God [Applause] and I wanted to breakr I really wanted to break through I didn't like it I didn't like how I felt I didn't like how I was feeling I didn't like how I acted toward my wife toward my kids toward my church toward anything I didn't like I mean I just I didn't like myself and so when I left that service that night I pulled out I was by myself I pulled out onto the main highway there Highway 371 and there was an 18 Wood brother the time was coming and the devil spoke in my ear said pull off right in front of that 18 Willer right now and nobody will miss [Music] you and for a split second I listen to that voice for a split second but in the voice of God begin to speak but you're a Son of God I'll be a refuge that's right I'll be a high tower just come underneath my wings you can find help in your time of need and maybe see I was in a place of real dark depression and not trying to play it off but you know what you can't play it off but there's only one way to get True Deliverance is to hear the voice of God and maybe that's you tonight depressions tried to consume you and fears tried to consume you and anxieties and all the stresses and suicide sitting there just chirping in your ear but I want you to know tonight there's a voice here there's a presence here there's a power here won't you just bow your head just for a minute tonight if that be you tonight young or old cuz we all face these battles if that be you and you you've heard that voice and it's chattered in your ear and you contemplated suicide and you wrestled with depression and and you just kind of given yourself over to these doubts and reasoning is the message right is the prophet true is this something that I've always been told because Mom and Daddy believe believe it but but really I got no joy I got no peace I got no happiness but what about you tonight if that be one of you tonight I don't believe God led me last week to speak this in vain but I believe God has got a voice for you to hear and he's telling you tonight your deliverance is in the house yes Lord your Miracle is in the room your healing is here tonight if depression if depression is taking you won you to step out of your seat come to this Altar and say God I'm hearing that voice tonight it's a voice of Victory it's Voice of Freedom yes if there's one of you right here tonight there you go don't be ashamed somebody hearing the voice of God looking beyond all the others that are here maybe would there be another young person maybe an older person maybe it's fear and and fears gripped you and you're so afraid God bless you young girl what about it mom and dad what about it is there others maybe you're you're young boys and you've been looking at pornography and things that you shouldn't look at and they consumed your time and consumed your attention and you feel guilty but you won't that Assurance today that you're a Son of God would there be another the voice is in the room the voice is here tonight God bless you young [Music] girl you parents I know sometimes it's hard to be strong set an example right here tonight is a moment you can have a breakthrough and I understand you've been you've received the Holy Ghost but you know there's one initial feeling but what about a refilling what about a rededication tonight I don't believe these meetings are here in vain if that be you and you want you want a fresh refilling of the Holy Ghost just step out of your seat don't be ashamed step out of your seat tonight said I'm coming to the Altar for a fresh refilling God bless you tonight come on will there be another said I'm getting up tonight is my night I need to refilling I need to recharge I need to hear the voice of God this is my moment this is my service this is my time God let me hear the voice tonight it's not the voice of Joe Adams or or your PR favorite preacher but this is the voice of God speaking to you tonight you can have a Revival right now make it special Church this is a special meeting this meeting yes Lord God put it on brother Thomas's heart to have me to come for you tonight because God is mindful of you tonight God is concerned for your situation tonight don't be so proudful that you that you just shut down the voice of God and said well I've been in a way a long time I'm good I'm where I need to be but say Lord here I come God bless you tonight you that came would there be another that would come tonight another would say brother Joe I just I got things on my life I need a chain breaker to come by break the chains off of me tonight the chain breaker's here he's here to deliver he's here to break through he's here to he's here to give you peace and joy he's here for you tonight father Lord you see each and everyone that's here at this altar young and old middleaged Lord tonight Lord you laid this on my heart last week and Lord as I studied throughout today I had no idea the direction by which you would have us to go Lord as far as how the service would flow from the beginning to the end but but God I know to trust you and Lord if it's just for one soul it's worth it all it's worth the hours of driving it's worth the time away from my own church the time away from my kids to be here for one soul for you said one soul is worth 10,000 worlds and Lord there's probably 2030 people at this altar tonight Lord you see the struggle depression and suicide and anxieties and fears and Lord many coming Lord because they want a refilling of the Holy Ghost God I just invite you tonight Lord that that the Holy Spirit would just begin to fall right now God and your people begin to cry out and and lift their voices to you tonight because they didn't hear from the voice of a man but they heard the voice of the son of man the voice of God once again speaking through his vessel and Lord as your Prophet would say you're not feeding on the the voice of a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of man God may we feed on that voice tonight may we feed on that Revelation tonight may we feed on that experience tonight father God may you set the captive free yes Lord God may you may you Vanquish depression and
