[52:58] may they know that there's a god that's
[53:00] the same yesterday
[53:02] today and forever and that you hear the
[53:04] prayers of your children lord
[53:06] father we just commit this service to
[53:07] you now i ask him for your leadership
[53:10] your guidance father
[53:11] and your blessing upon the reading of
[53:13] the word in jesus name
[53:15] amen and amen let's turn our bibles if
[53:18] you will to the
[53:20] uh let's go all the way back to psalms
[53:24] if you will
[53:26] go back to this book of psalms
[53:30] and
[53:33] we want to speak tonight on strength
[53:37] strength amen
[53:41] i mean i was pondering that thought
[53:42] about strength and it
[53:45] uh come into my mind the lord began to
[53:47] deal me with that thought of what
[53:48] brother bram
[53:49] said about a man that had been like
[53:52] devil possessed or whatever he
[53:53] becomes many times his normal strength
[53:58] amen somebody that's demon possessed and
[54:00] he says how much more the holy spirit
[54:02] should give us strength isn't that right
[54:04] and make us strong amen
[54:07] and so i wanted to read something david
[54:09] said here about strength
[54:12] in psalms the 1 psalms 18 not 118 but
[54:16] psalms 18
[54:22] amen
[54:26] and we'll read run one through seven i
[54:29] will
[54:30] love thee oh lord my strength
[54:35] the lord is my rock and my fortress
[54:38] he is my deliverer my god
[54:41] there he says it again my strength
[54:44] in whom i will trust my buckler the horn
[54:48] of my salvation
[54:49] and my high tower i will call upon the
[54:52] lord who is worthy
[54:54] to be praised so shall i be saved from
[54:56] all my from my
[54:57] enemies the sorrows of death come past
[55:01] me
[55:01] the floods of ungodly made me afraid
[55:05] the sorrows of hell compassed me about
[55:08] the snares of death prevented me
[55:11] in my distress i called upon the lord
[55:14] and cried unto my god he heard my voice
[55:18] out of his temple and my cry became
[55:21] before him
[55:22] even into his ears then the earth shook
[55:25] and trembled the mountains also of the
[55:27] hills moved and were shaken
[55:30] because he was wroth amen may god and
[55:32] his blessings to the reading of the
[55:34] words you can be seated
[55:37] amen so david begins to describe here
[55:41] amen um
[55:45] about the sorrows of death compassing
[55:48] him
[55:48] in verse 4 and also the sorrows of hell
[55:53] compassing me about and the snares of
[55:55] death preventing him so
[55:57] how many knows david had gotten into
[55:59] some real dangerous situations
[56:02] he had gotten into very sorrowful places
[56:05] and he
[56:06] should we say he got into some real bad
[56:08] places in his life
[56:10] but he knew what it was like to call
[56:12] upon the lord
[56:13] amen and call for strength he was
[56:16] without strength amen
[56:18] so tonight we want to talk about amen
[56:20] perhaps even some of the statements that
[56:21] we would might make some time about
[56:23] oh well i'm tough i can handle it you
[56:26] know or you can handle it you're tough
[56:28] you know tough tough people and so forth
[56:30] isn't that right
[56:31] and but i want to first of all look at
[56:33] it you know talking about strength you
[56:35] know another place the bible talks about
[56:37] and i'm not going to get into it very
[56:38] much but i want to
[56:39] just mention it about abraham amen
[56:42] brother bab talked they were well
[56:45] stricken in age
[56:46] they were old folks isn't that like they
[56:48] were beginning to get old 65 years old
[56:50] they were losing their strength how many
[56:52] knows as you get older
[56:53] you lose your strength amen you get
[56:57] you know you were you're not near as
[56:58] strong as what you used to be
[57:00] abraham and sarah were of course weak
[57:03] and then of course after they got the
[57:04] promise of having children and so forth
[57:06] you know they even got weaker and weaker
[57:08] all the way to 95 years old and sarah 75
[57:12] years old so they got really old and
[57:14] they got really weak and they got really
[57:17] you know where they needed strength but
[57:19] you know uh
[57:20] as the prophet put it he says you know
[57:22] he came and he presented himself to
[57:24] abraham as el shaddai amen which was
[57:27] a man interpreted being depressed at god
[57:30] am i right
[57:31] and he told him to just you know nurse
[57:33] so to speak on el shaddai
[57:35] amen amen because you know that he was
[57:38] going to draw his strength
[57:40] from god amen and so as we get older you
[57:43] different ones of us get older i don't
[57:44] care if you're old if you're young or
[57:46] what you are
[57:47] amen your true strength comes from the
[57:49] lord
[57:51] tonight before i really get to the core
[57:53] of my subject i want to talk about three
[57:55] different
[57:55] areas of strength amen areas of strength
[57:58] and that is
[57:59] you know the strength of the body the
[58:01] strength of the spirit
[58:02] and the strength of the soul because
[58:04] we're a triune being amen
[58:07] and i know that anybody that's lived
[58:09] very long
[58:10] knows that you know just physical
[58:13] strength or just
[58:13] body strength isn't really all that much
[58:16] strength
[58:17] the bible one place it says body bodily
[58:20] exercises profit is little
[58:22] another place i believe it says it
[58:23] profit is nothing
[58:25] is that right so it just doesn't do a
[58:27] whole lot for uh
[58:28] your physical body and the physical
[58:30] strength that you have
[58:32] and so i was thinking about this
[58:33] physical body and how much strength
[58:35] it really has how strong it really is
[58:39] and so uh i i googled it i i talked to
[58:42] siri about it and she told me
[58:44] how how strong a man what the strongest
[58:46] man was and
[58:47] how much weight that he has lifted amen
[58:50] and so
[58:51] um with anybody like the guests in the
[58:53] class tonight about the
[58:55] most weight that a man human being is
[58:57] lifted
[59:00] seven hundred and eleven of eleven
[59:03] and 1104. eddie the eddie the
[59:06] beast hall over in england i guess it
[59:09] was 1104
[59:12] somewhere in their pounds i've got a
[59:14] picture and it says also that later
[59:16] he picked up 1180 some pounds with the
[59:19] the barbell going across at 18 inches
[59:22] with a little bit higher barbell
[59:24] i mean he got uh 1180 some pounds
[59:27] up which is quite a bit you know and so
[59:29] he that's pretty strong that's pretty a
[59:31] lot of weight
[59:32] isn't that right i mean but it did say
[59:35] that that when he was when he did it
[59:37] that he would bled out of his ears he
[59:38] bled out of his eyes but out of his nose
[59:41] you know every part of his head was
[59:43] bleeding and he about passed out
[59:45] you know but that's what it said but
[59:47] anyway so i guess he was really really
[59:49] you know and that is a lot of weight
[59:51] truly is but you know you think about
[59:53] that but you know that's just the
[59:54] physical
[59:55] just this the body power that's not a
[59:58] whole lot
[59:58] when you go into the spirit realm how
[1:00:00] many knows that truly are strength now
[1:00:03] your spirit can make your physical body
[1:00:06] many times more distract than it's used
[1:00:08] to
[1:00:09] all right and so that's in the spirit
[1:00:12] realm
[1:00:12] amen for for example let's just read a
[1:00:15] story with me if you will go to mark
[1:00:17] 5 amen and we'll read a script story and
[1:00:19] we'll go right into the spirit
[1:00:21] part of uh strength talking about
[1:00:25] in the spirit realm there's much more
[1:00:27] strength now
[1:00:28] uh we know that just uh you know cain
[1:00:30] let me just maybe
[1:00:32] maybe pick this up just a little bit
[1:00:33] here talking about cain
[1:00:35] how many knows that you know he was
[1:00:37] actually a churchgoer
[1:00:38] amen one place he was called a believer
[1:00:41] and that right
[1:00:42] king was you know and he was a church
[1:00:44] goer and he worshipped god but you know
[1:00:47] he found out what the strength of his
[1:00:49] spirit will do
[1:00:51] and what it'll make a man do amen he
[1:00:53] found out what
[1:00:54] evil spirits do amen such as jealousy
[1:00:57] and that right he found out that
[1:00:59] jealousy
[1:01:00] or even envy led to jealousy about the
[1:01:02] same thing
[1:01:03] and then that led to hatred and that
[1:01:06] right and that hatred
[1:01:08] gave him so much strength amen until he
[1:01:11] actually killed his brother
[1:01:14] it's an evil strength it's an
[1:01:17] overwhelming strength it's a power it's
[1:01:19] an evil power isn't that right
[1:01:21] amen all these things you talk about
[1:01:23] cain and and what he would do because of
[1:01:25] uh
[1:01:26] the spirit that was on him the spirit
[1:01:28] that got on him
[1:01:29] amen and the things that he me it caused
[1:01:32] him to do
[1:01:33] but over in mark the fifth chapter we
[1:01:36] want to go and take a little
[1:01:38] journey through a graveyard tonight if
[1:01:39] you would with me
[1:01:41] amen and they came over unto the other
[1:01:43] side of the sea
[1:01:45] and the country of the dorians
[1:01:48] and when he was come out of the ship
[1:01:50] immediately that met him
[1:01:52] out of the tombs a man with an unclean
[1:01:54] spirit
[1:01:56] who had his dwellings among the tombs
[1:01:59] amen he
[1:02:00] my home was in the graveyard
[1:02:04] he slept with dead people didn't bother
[1:02:06] him not did it
[1:02:08] and no man could bind him no not with
[1:02:12] chains huh i'd like to see eddie uh
[1:02:16] the the the beast try to tear a chain in
[1:02:19] half
[1:02:20] right because it can hold more than 1100
[1:02:22] pounds can't it
[1:02:24] that's right but this guy could rip
[1:02:26] chains
[1:02:29] that right because he had been bound
[1:02:32] often
[1:02:33] it says often been bound with feathers
[1:02:36] and chains and the chains had been
[1:02:39] plucked
[1:02:40] asunder by him and the fetters
[1:02:43] broken into pieces talk about a superman
[1:02:48] talk about a strong person he had a lot
[1:02:51] of strength didn't he
[1:02:52] that spirit he may have been as grounded
[1:02:54] a little bit i'm sure he didn't look
[1:02:56] nothing like eddie
[1:02:59] because if you see eddie he looks like a
[1:03:00] monster
[1:03:02] all right he's huge you know i wouldn't
[1:03:04] want him follow
[1:03:05] me let alone do anything else anyway but
[1:03:09] listen this guy here was in feathers but
[1:03:11] he was probably didn't look like too
[1:03:12] much he probably didn't eat too much but
[1:03:14] yet he was super strong
[1:03:16] and they couldn't keep him in jail they
[1:03:18] couldn't catch the guy
[1:03:20] it was terrible right and no man
[1:03:24] and neither could any man tame him
[1:03:27] and always night and day he was among he
[1:03:30] was in the mountains
[1:03:31] and in the tombs crying and cutting
[1:03:34] himself with stones
[1:03:36] and when he saw jesus afar off he ran
[1:03:38] and worshiped him
[1:03:40] and cried with a loud voice and said
[1:03:42] what have i to do with thee jesus thou
[1:03:44] son of the most high god
[1:03:46] i adjure thee by god that thou torment
[1:03:49] me not
[1:03:51] and he said because listen i believe one
[1:03:53] place brother bam said that these devils
[1:03:55] recognize who
[1:03:56] jesus was and they didn't want to go to
[1:03:58] torment yet
[1:04:00] so they said don't torment me yet
[1:04:03] because they know they got torment
[1:04:04] coming
[1:04:05] that right and he said unto him come out
[1:04:08] of the man thou and clean spirit
[1:04:10] and he asked him what is thy name
[1:04:14] and he answered saying my name is legion
[1:04:17] for we
[1:04:18] are many let me know jesus god didn't
[1:04:22] just have one devil
[1:04:24] he had a lot of devils he had a lot of
[1:04:27] evil spirits in him
[1:04:29] ma let me tell you something that's what
[1:04:32] the world is full of it how many knows
[1:04:34] most of the people that you meet out
[1:04:36] there they don't got just one evil
[1:04:38] spirit
[1:04:38] they're full of evil spirits and they
[1:04:41] can have many spirits many evil spirits
[1:04:44] on them
[1:04:44] at the same time and he besought him
[1:04:48] much that he would not send them out of
[1:04:51] the country
[1:04:52] now there was there nigh unto the
[1:04:54] mountains a great herd of swine feeding
[1:04:57] and all the devils beside him saying
[1:04:59] sent us into the swine
[1:05:02] all right that we may enter into them
[1:05:05] and forthwith jesus gave them leave and
[1:05:07] the unclean spirits went out
[1:05:09] and entered into the swine and the herd
[1:05:11] ran violently
[1:05:13] down a steep place into the sea
[1:05:17] and there were about two thousand and
[1:05:19] they were choked in the sea
[1:05:21] and they were choked in the sweet and we
[1:05:23] we know what the rest of the story is
[1:05:25] how the
[1:05:25] different ones ask him to leave the area
[1:05:28] because they didn't want him to
[1:05:29] mess up their business it was bad for
[1:05:32] their swine business isn't that right
[1:05:34] and then rather than accepting a man
[1:05:36] that could cast out devils and bring
[1:05:38] eternal life
[1:05:39] they'd rather have hogs and it's sad to
[1:05:42] think that people rather have hogs than
[1:05:44] jesus
[1:05:46] you know that's quite something because
[1:05:47] you know the miracle of that man and
[1:05:49] being delivered and what god had done
[1:05:51] for him
[1:05:51] said hey you know come and preach us a
[1:05:53] sermon come and have a revival in our
[1:05:55] church but don't say they said leave we
[1:05:57] don't want you around here
[1:05:59] isn't that something how human beings
[1:06:01] can be so closed-minded and so
[1:06:03] amen until they you know it's right
[1:06:05] there in front of them the power of
[1:06:06] god's in front of them and they still
[1:06:08] don't
[1:06:08] even want it amen so my my my when you
[1:06:13] look at that
[1:06:14] it's like wow amen another place just
[1:06:16] another good
[1:06:17] good on a couple of good sides somebody
[1:06:19] knows that sham guard just being a
[1:06:21] regular guy he wasn't much
[1:06:24] he was just a farmer but when the spirit
[1:06:26] of god came upon him
[1:06:28] his righteous indignation come up in him
[1:06:31] isn't that right
[1:06:33] amen and i really really this has to do
[1:06:35] with part
[1:06:36] part of the soul too i want to talk
[1:06:37] about the soul and its strength but
[1:06:39] you know it was very special when the
[1:06:41] spirit of god come upon him come upon
[1:06:43] david come upon samson
[1:06:45] how did samson would kill a thousand
[1:06:47] philistines but six hundred ain't that
[1:06:48] much different
[1:06:50] so we talk about samson a lot but samgar
[1:06:53] if the spirit of god came on him because
[1:06:54] him he knows it's not limit to a person
[1:06:57] it's only limited to the spirit of god
[1:06:58] but whether the spirit of god came
[1:07:00] on you it don't matter necessarily the
[1:07:02] numbers and nobody's going to defeat you
[1:07:04] and that spirit came upon them
[1:07:06] and then because he'd made him so strong
[1:07:08] amen that
[1:07:10] we all know that you couldn't kill a
[1:07:11] thousand you would wear out
[1:07:13] before you killed a thousand and then i
[1:07:16] don't know how long you would be at
[1:07:17] battle with one
[1:07:18] or two or three at the same time but it
[1:07:20] would be a chore
[1:07:21] it'd be a real choice and it takes
[1:07:23] supernatural power
[1:07:25] to give you the kind of strength that
[1:07:26] you would need to do
[1:07:28] that much killing both for sham god or
[1:07:30] for that and that's why i think a lot of
[1:07:32] times the bible talked about
[1:07:33] he was afterwards very tired amen and
[1:07:36] had to go and rest for a couple days
[1:07:39] you know but you think about that how
[1:07:41] how in the spirit realm
[1:07:43] how much stronger that a person can be
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:46] in the spirit realm both with the holy
[1:07:48] ghost and also
[1:07:49] the the privacy and the ugliness and the
[1:07:53] horribleness
[1:07:54] because people don't have even common
[1:07:56] decency amen that just a normal human
[1:07:58] being would have
[1:08:00] amen when evil spirits come upon they do
[1:08:02] things like hitler did
[1:08:05] very evil spiritual they'll go into
[1:08:07] schools and shoot little kids
[1:08:09] what kind of a wicked spirit would do
[1:08:11] something like that
[1:08:12] to go to a third grader or fourth grader
[1:08:15] just little kids and shoot them
[1:08:17] that's a wicked spirit amen but how many
[1:08:20] knows it's the devil's power it's the
[1:08:22] devil's strength
[1:08:24] that drives them to do things like that
[1:08:27] that's why the tribulation period folks
[1:08:30] all of these video games and all of
[1:08:32] these things it's all getting them ready
[1:08:34] desensitizing them
[1:08:36] getting them ready for the bloodiest
[1:08:38] time the world has ever known
[1:08:41] amen we're right on the brink of it
[1:08:44] amen but that's the evil spirits that we
[1:08:48] do
[1:08:48] amen david amen he knew that he didn't
[1:08:50] have the power how many knows david knew
[1:08:52] he didn't have the power
[1:08:54] but he had a god and he believed and
[1:08:56] trusted in the strength of jehovah to
[1:08:58] deliver him
[1:09:00] amen that's what we truly need more of
[1:09:02] now i don't know about you let me just
[1:09:04] ask you this question tonight
[1:09:05] how many really needs more strength
[1:09:09] i really need more strength well i'm
[1:09:12] gonna tell you tonight how you're gonna
[1:09:14] get that strength
[1:09:15] how it's gonna come and you're not gonna
[1:09:18] like it
[1:09:21] uh well y'all like it well just wait a
[1:09:23] minute then
[1:09:25] we'll see i hope you do but amen it
[1:09:28] doesn't always come in the way that you
[1:09:30] think it might come
[1:09:31] all right but let's talk about the soul
[1:09:34] for a minute
[1:09:35] now truly if you look at this and you
[1:09:38] look at the spirit realm of things and
[1:09:40] and so forth and the power that it has
[1:09:42] but i believe tonight
[1:09:44] that the soul amen the soul has even
[1:09:47] more
[1:09:48] strength
[1:09:51] the soul the power that lays in the soul
[1:09:55] it even has even more strength wow
[1:09:58] how's that brother balor well it has to
[1:10:00] do with true
[1:10:02] love that goes down on the inside of the
[1:10:04] inside because
[1:10:05] we all know that peer people people will
[1:10:07] do things that go so far with certain
[1:10:10] things
[1:10:10] in the spirit realm but then they'll
[1:10:12] drop off but they're things that people
[1:10:14] will do that is
[1:10:16] just out of the human comprehension
[1:10:20] and in this realm you find that people
[1:10:22] that have a real sort of have a soul so
[1:10:25] to speak they still got a soul down
[1:10:26] there
[1:10:27] hey man unless we've heard many stories
[1:10:30] of heroic acts even in war
[1:10:32] many times they'll get the medal of
[1:10:34] honor because their buddy
[1:10:35] amen perhaps in the army and the war
[1:10:37] somewhere is out there he's wounded
[1:10:39] he's on the road and he can't go anymore
[1:10:42] but they're still shooting at him and
[1:10:44] they're to your brother
[1:10:45] and perhaps it's your brother out there
[1:10:46] and man you're just
[1:10:48] in your soul huh it's your the chorus
[1:10:51] that is my brother isn't that right
[1:10:53] and you'll run out through bullets and
[1:10:55] everything else and go
[1:10:56] great it would normally be you wouldn't
[1:10:58] do that people don't go out there don't
[1:11:00] even think about doing that but you'll
[1:11:02] do it because
[1:11:03] down in your soul you have the love of
[1:11:05] god in your heart or you love your
[1:11:06] brother
[1:11:07] is that right that love power of love in
[1:11:10] the soul
[1:11:11] that real power it'll make a mother
[1:11:13] running into a house that the flame that
[1:11:15] the fire department meant won't even run
[1:11:17] into it anymore
[1:11:19] no no you don't go in there you're gonna
[1:11:22] die
[1:11:22] she don't care if she's gonna die and so
[1:11:24] that is her baby
[1:11:26] and that right and she will run through
[1:11:28] those flames just to try to save that
[1:11:30] little baby we know the story of that
[1:11:32] isn't that right
[1:11:33] that's kind of power comes from the soul
[1:11:35] amen the power of the soul
[1:11:37] is when you love god and you realize
[1:11:40] that down in the soul
[1:11:41] there's a gene how many knows there's a
[1:11:42] gene
[1:11:44] and if you are a seed of god that's
[1:11:46] going to come up it doesn't matter how
[1:11:48] much concrete there is it don't matter
[1:11:50] how much
[1:11:50] it's going to find its way out the
[1:11:52] sunlight it's very powerful
[1:11:54] you know right it'll crack the sidewalks
[1:11:56] if it has to
[1:11:57] amen and it'll make it'll make you run
[1:12:00] through a fire and if you have true
[1:12:02] real genuine relationship and love for
[1:12:04] jesus christ
[1:12:06] paul said there's not tribulation
[1:12:08] distress no nothing that's ever going to
[1:12:10] separate you from that
[1:12:12] people that just have the spirit on on
[1:12:15] their flesh and in their flesh
[1:12:16] realm and so forth and also in their
[1:12:18] spirit realm you know
[1:12:20] when the tribulation comes from the hard
[1:12:22] times come the bible says by and by
[1:12:24] they're offended and
[1:12:25] off they go but not somebody that's
[1:12:27] genuinely born again
[1:12:29] when that seed is all the way down on
[1:12:31] the inside there is
[1:12:32] nothing that can separate you from the
[1:12:34] love of god you will
[1:12:36] gladly walk into an arena knowing that
[1:12:38] you will be ripped apart
[1:12:40] by lions because you love your god so
[1:12:43] much
[1:12:44] you can't you can't you can't stop that
[1:12:48] you can't stop the church of the living
[1:12:49] god you can't slap somebody that's
[1:12:52] absolutely in love with almighty god
[1:12:55] hello listen to this if you just listen
[1:12:58] to your flesh
[1:12:58] how many knows if you just have your
[1:13:00] just have to flesh to deal with your
[1:13:02] empty you really don't have any
[1:13:04] spirit man it ain't going to take
[1:13:06] nothing for the devil to talk you out of
[1:13:08] coming to church or
[1:13:09] praying in the morning or reading your
[1:13:11] bible
[1:13:12] no it don't take no any kind of flimsy
[1:13:15] excuse he's going to do
[1:13:16] but if you've got the spirit amen i'll
[1:13:18] tell you what you love to get on your
[1:13:20] knees and have fellowship with god and
[1:13:22] say god here i am
[1:13:24] how are you doing today i love you lord
[1:13:27] it's not hard to pray when you've got
[1:13:29] the holy ghost it's not hard to read
[1:13:31] your bible it's not hard to say praise
[1:13:33] the lord
[1:13:33] it's not hard to worship god why because
[1:13:36] it gives you strength to do it
[1:13:38] but it's got to be down in here amen
[1:13:43] so you see where i'm coming from tonight
[1:13:46] that down in your soul
[1:13:47] when that love of god is done in your
[1:13:49] soul paul said self tribulation cell
[1:13:52] distress
[1:13:53] shall death not even death can separate
[1:13:56] us from the love of god
[1:13:58] people would gladly be burnt at the
[1:14:00] stake burned alive at the stake
[1:14:03] i mean they would do it just to try to
[1:14:05] get them to renounce their religion
[1:14:09] but why it was so powerful down in
[1:14:11] inside they'd rather be burnt alive
[1:14:14] than to give up this fellowship that he
[1:14:16] had with god i mean believes that truly
[1:14:18] our
[1:14:18] greatest thing tonight is the fellowship
[1:14:21] that we have
[1:14:22] with jesus christ nothing can separate
[1:14:25] it's a real power
[1:14:27] the most powerful thing there is when
[1:14:29] you become relation to almighty god
[1:14:32] there's nothing going to stop you so i
[1:14:35] got to thinking about this and i got to
[1:14:36] pray and i said lord strength
[1:14:38] i talk about strength and so forth the
[1:14:40] body of fear and then i begin to think
[1:14:42] isn't the lord brought that message to
[1:14:43] my mind about where
[1:14:45] where where brother brandon preached
[1:14:47] about strength how many knows he
[1:14:48] preached about strength
[1:14:50] that's his strength the joy of the lord
[1:14:52] i thought well the joy of the lord is my
[1:14:54] strength that's one good thing
[1:14:56] they that wait upon the lord that right
[1:15:00] shall renew their strength man these
[1:15:03] dear scriptures talk about strength
[1:15:05] and how to get strength and so forth but
[1:15:07] the prophet of god brought it in a
[1:15:08] beautiful way so turn with me another
[1:15:10] scripture and we want to look at the
[1:15:12] aspect of how to receive strength
[1:15:14] how to get strength how to be stronger a
[1:15:18] stronger christian
[1:15:19] paul said finally my brethren be strong
[1:15:22] in the lord
[1:15:23] isn't that right and in the power of his
[1:15:25] mind
[1:15:28] okay so in second corinthians
[1:15:31] the 12th chapter second corinthians 12.
[1:15:37] amen brother bam makes a statement he
[1:15:41] says you know we always want to tell
[1:15:43] how big we are and how great we are
[1:15:46] how tough we are ah we're tough
[1:15:49] people think they're tough amen
[1:15:52] let's build on that for just a minute
[1:15:56] paul how many knows paul was a pharisee
[1:15:58] of the he
[1:15:59] he said let me give you a few minutes
[1:16:01] here you know not to boast but
[1:16:03] if anybody's got the right to boast i
[1:16:04] got to write the most i was a pharisee
[1:16:06] of the pharisees i was
[1:16:08] this side of the other circumcised on
[1:16:09] the earth of the sock of israel and he
[1:16:11] went on and on and on and on
[1:16:13] but what did he say eventually he says
[1:16:15] you know all those things that count but
[1:16:16] dung
[1:16:17] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[1:16:20] jesus christ
[1:16:21] he was very zealous for the lord
[1:16:24] he was very tough very strong
[1:16:28] but he found out that the lord had to
[1:16:30] take all of that toughness away from him
[1:16:33] he had to knock him down amen
[1:16:36] you realize god has to knock us down
[1:16:41] have you ever heard the phrase you know
[1:16:43] sometimes they'd have a
[1:16:44] fight you know and they'd fight each
[1:16:46] other and and one guy would knock him
[1:16:48] down and
[1:16:49] if he'd stay down the fight was over but
[1:16:51] if he got back up fight wasn't over
[1:16:53] right stay down stay down don't get up
[1:16:57] right i believe that's what god tells us
[1:16:59] stay down and
[1:17:00] don't get up but listen so paul
[1:17:03] here was talking about his problem that
[1:17:07] he had
[1:17:08] he had an issue either with his eyes or
[1:17:10] something
[1:17:11] and he kept bothering him in verse 7 of
[1:17:14] chapter 12
[1:17:14] second corinthians 12
[1:17:17] beginning with verse 7. at least i
[1:17:20] should be exalted above measure through
[1:17:22] the abundance of the revelations
[1:17:25] that was given to me a thorn in the
[1:17:28] flesh
[1:17:30] the messenger of satan to buffet me
[1:17:35] wow at least i should be exalted
[1:17:39] above measure for this thing
[1:17:43] i besought the lord thrice
[1:17:46] that it might depart from me amen
[1:17:49] don't we pray for problems to leave us
[1:17:51] sometimes
[1:17:53] just take care of this problem and i
[1:17:55] don't want to have this problem anymore
[1:17:57] huh he saw him thrice
[1:18:02] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:18:06] sufficient for thee
[1:18:07] for my strength is made perfect
[1:18:11] in your weakness
[1:18:16] amen most gladly therefore will i
[1:18:19] rather glory in my infirmities
[1:18:24] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:18:27] me
[1:18:28] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[1:18:31] and reproaches
[1:18:32] and necessities and persecutions
[1:18:36] in distresses for christ's sake
[1:18:40] for when i am weak then
[1:18:43] am i strong amen
[1:18:48] but we could rephrase that when i
[1:18:51] am weak then he is strong
[1:18:54] amen so brother brahms goes to saying
[1:18:58] listen
[1:18:59] we want to tell how big well he was
[1:19:01] talking about pentecost how many knows
[1:19:03] he was talking about pentecost and
[1:19:05] and when he was preaching on perfect
[1:19:06] strength by perfect weakness
[1:19:08] everybody always want to tell how great
[1:19:10] they are and so forth
[1:19:12] and that's why god gave me this text he
[1:19:14] says to get that
[1:19:16] out of our mind see
[1:19:19] we come together amen he says if we
[1:19:22] don't come together to find our bad
[1:19:24] places then we don't come for the right
[1:19:26] reason we must come to find our
[1:19:28] weaknesses
[1:19:29] find our bad places to see how little we
[1:19:34] are and put our trust
[1:19:37] in somebody that's strong
[1:19:41] amen praise the lord
[1:19:44] listen again if we ever get to a spot
[1:19:47] that we think that we can do it in our
[1:19:49] own intelligence
[1:19:50] by our own abilities and we've got to
[1:19:52] master that in such a way
[1:19:53] and get rid of that thing and lay it
[1:19:55] aside so that god can use us
[1:19:57] that's right let's talk about a few
[1:20:00] minutes about
[1:20:01] how that jesus christ god is amen he's a
[1:20:04] potter isn't that right
[1:20:06] amen and we are the clay he molds us and
[1:20:08] brother babe says sometimes
[1:20:10] god has to take that part because the
[1:20:12] day ain't high likely and he has to
[1:20:14] thoroughly break that pot down
[1:20:16] so that he can remold it
[1:20:19] we're all so tight with gold how many
[1:20:22] knows that we're also tight with gold
[1:20:24] beaten gold
[1:20:28] beaten go where god beats us down he
[1:20:31] coming up paul thought that he was a
[1:20:33] great guy he thought he was on top of
[1:20:35] the world
[1:20:36] and got the head that god had to punch
[1:20:38] him he had to
[1:20:39] knock him off of his high heart down
[1:20:42] onto damascus road and make him realize
[1:20:44] that everything
[1:20:46] that he thought he was doing right in
[1:20:48] his zealousness for god was
[1:20:50] all absolutely wrong
[1:20:55] the very god that he thought he was
[1:20:57] working for he was persecuting
[1:21:00] in that right after that he had to
[1:21:03] realize that he was absolutely only
[1:21:05] going about it the wrong way
[1:21:08] and god just struck him down on the road
[1:21:10] to damascus he took him off of his high
[1:21:12] horse as the brother ma'am said
[1:21:15] amen and that my friend brother
[1:21:19] this is the core of the strength of
[1:21:22] receiving our strength is when god
[1:21:24] knocks us down
[1:21:27] getting to a place to where you realize
[1:21:31] you're not so tough you can't handle
[1:21:33] that situation
[1:21:36] do you realize that's exactly what god
[1:21:38] tried to do with israel
[1:21:40] and that just like he did with all god
[1:21:42] three times
[1:21:44] different times god tried to knock
[1:21:46] israel down
[1:21:48] and then right three times one time it
[1:21:50] was because
[1:21:51] you know he he took him to a place where
[1:21:55] there was no
[1:21:56] direction to go no way and we as human
[1:21:59] beings we like to make our own way
[1:22:02] we always want a way out we always this
[1:22:05] is
[1:22:06] oh my we always try to fix it
[1:22:10] so to speak and have our thing in it and
[1:22:13] israel
[1:22:13] they come to the red sea and they
[1:22:15] thought boy this can't be right you know
[1:22:16] we're not supposed to just come up
[1:22:18] against the red sea
[1:22:20] we're not consequenced to come to a
[1:22:22] place where we don't know what
[1:22:24] to do next but that was god was telling
[1:22:27] them look you've got to die
[1:22:28] to your own way i'm leading you here
[1:22:33] sometimes we don't know which way to go
[1:22:35] sometimes we don't know the next move
[1:22:37] and god brings us to that place to show
[1:22:39] us hey you know you got to realize that
[1:22:41] it's not about you making the way
[1:22:43] you've got to realize i'm making your
[1:22:45] way
[1:22:47] and he brought him down to that broken
[1:22:49] place the place of breaking them
[1:22:52] is that right but how many knows they
[1:22:54] would not be broken
[1:22:56] instead they murmured and complained
[1:22:59] against god
[1:23:03] amen let's look here
[1:23:17] now that's now listen so he says
[1:23:21] we've got to get rid of that thing such
[1:23:22] a way and lay it aside that god can use
[1:23:24] us
[1:23:25] so he can use us and make a complete
[1:23:29] surrender we cannot use
[1:23:32] one ability we've got to make a complete
[1:23:36] surrender and come to god you've got to
[1:23:40] surrender
[1:23:41] to him both soul body
[1:23:45] and spirit i believes you've got to be
[1:23:48] completely certain if you really want
[1:23:49] the power of god
[1:23:51] your real strength is when you're
[1:23:53] completely surrendered
[1:23:56] to god that's what god was trying to do
[1:23:59] with israel trying to get him to
[1:24:00] completely surrender
[1:24:01] when he knocked saul down onto the road
[1:24:03] damascus
[1:24:04] he meant he made him realize that hey
[1:24:06] you're completely wrong
[1:24:07] sit back and let me guide you let me
[1:24:09] lead you
[1:24:10] huh just surrender completely to me
[1:24:13] everything you got
[1:24:14] everything that you are has to be
[1:24:16] surrendered to god in order for god to
[1:24:18] work his will
[1:24:19] in you and in me now that's hard i know
[1:24:22] because we're always wanting
[1:24:24] to put our part in something that we
[1:24:27] know
[1:24:29] now isn't that exactly what it was every
[1:24:31] time
[1:24:32] you know because he he tested them on
[1:24:35] in a way that the god will make a way
[1:24:37] they want to make their own way
[1:24:39] and then the other thing that god tried
[1:24:41] to break him on was that you know
[1:24:43] it's not about you supplying for
[1:24:45] yourself
[1:24:46] amen because god let him get hungry and
[1:24:49] he also let him get
[1:24:50] thirsty isn't that right amen and so he
[1:24:54] he wanted them to come to a place of
[1:24:56] surrender
[1:24:57] to god saying lord i know that you've
[1:25:00] led us this far i know you'll provide
[1:25:02] food sure my stomach's hungry i'm
[1:25:04] growled
[1:25:04] amen but i know that you'll make a way
[1:25:08] but instead it would not be broken
[1:25:12] huh lord if it's your will to die for me
[1:25:16] to starve to death and here i
[1:25:18] am lord huh god would have been happy
[1:25:21] with that
[1:25:22] here look at them they're not
[1:25:24] complaining they're completely
[1:25:25] surrendered to me
[1:25:27] here let me bring some manna down
[1:25:31] let me rain down some quail huh
[1:25:34] god have been smiling that's what i'm
[1:25:36] looking for how many knows
[1:25:38] god brought him all to these places
[1:25:40] because he was looking for
[1:25:41] a product he was trying to mold him he
[1:25:44] was
[1:25:45] shaping them i believe you know i
[1:25:48] believe that's
[1:25:48] what god does with you and me every day
[1:25:50] he is in the remoting business
[1:25:54] in the reshaping business
[1:25:57] amen austin he's got to completely crush
[1:26:00] that car
[1:26:02] it's a piece of junk crush the thing
[1:26:04] send it back
[1:26:05] into the hot kettle and what a little do
[1:26:07] it'll become lava it'll just become a
[1:26:10] a hot liquid and then whatever they make
[1:26:13] out of it it can be remolded that's what
[1:26:14] we got to be it may completely
[1:26:16] broken down and reshaped
[1:26:20] isn't that right that's what god was
[1:26:21] trying to do with israel he was dealing
[1:26:24] with paul
[1:26:24] and every person that comes to god has
[1:26:27] to come to that
[1:26:28] molding place that place to where you
[1:26:30] don't supply for yourself you don't
[1:26:32] worry about your own way
[1:26:34] you ask god for his direction he brings
[1:26:37] us that place of being broken
[1:26:39] down amen he gives us it's really good
[1:26:43] but we always want in our part we want
[1:26:45] listen to this
[1:26:46] i hope everybody at least for myself and
[1:26:49] i believe a lot of
[1:26:50] us i know a lot of people that have
[1:26:52] gotten in major trouble
[1:26:55] major trouble because amen they've tried
[1:26:59] to do things in their own ability
[1:27:02] when you try to make things happen hello
[1:27:05] you're going to make it happen you
[1:27:07] remember god ain't in it
[1:27:10] god ain't in it one bit he can't use any
[1:27:13] of our own abilities
[1:27:15] it has to be god doing it amen
[1:27:18] and as long as you do it in your own
[1:27:21] ability do things by your own ability
[1:27:23] remember you will
[1:27:24] bitterly fail only when you completely
[1:27:28] surrender to god and then watch god do
[1:27:30] it
[1:27:30] and then it'll be perfect but so many
[1:27:33] times we get carnal
[1:27:34] we let that self we let that self come
[1:27:38] in
[1:27:38] isn't that right but the man says that's
[1:27:40] your most dangerous that's their biggest
[1:27:42] enemy is that self it's what paul said
[1:27:45] about the black dog he says
[1:27:46] when i we would do it's that other guy
[1:27:49] that's right there beside you
[1:27:51] all right it's that it's at the high
[1:27:54] horse that dog that brother man talk
[1:27:56] about that black dog that wants to raise
[1:27:58] up and he
[1:27:58] always wants to have his input on it he
[1:28:02] tries to come he's always there to try
[1:28:04] to
[1:28:04] every day he'll if you're completely
[1:28:06] surrendered that dog will try to raise
[1:28:08] up tomorrow morning
[1:28:10] he'll try to come but he'll try to
[1:28:12] revive how why do you think brother
[1:28:13] brown says you know
[1:28:14] amen get off your eyes or horses like
[1:28:17] paul
[1:28:18] amen and stay on the mus damascus road
[1:28:21] and then what did he say and
[1:28:25] stay there that's right and stay there
[1:28:30] don't get up hallelujah
[1:28:34] help thomas don't get up stay down there
[1:28:37] stay surrendered cause the old guy he'll
[1:28:40] want to raise up
[1:28:42] he'll try to get up but let me tell you
[1:28:45] some only the holy spirit will help you
[1:28:47] to stay down
[1:28:48] and watch the perfect strength of god be
[1:28:50] manifested
[1:28:52] the perfect strength of god because god
[1:28:54] said to paul
[1:28:56] my strength is made perfect when you're
[1:28:58] completely
[1:28:59] incapable when you're at the place you
[1:29:02] can't you're not such a tough guy
[1:29:03] anymore
[1:29:05] my strength is made perfect in your
[1:29:08] weakness
[1:29:09] amen in the same way with israel red sea
[1:29:12] his strength would have been made
[1:29:14] perfect in weakness
[1:29:15] his strength was still made perfect
[1:29:17] wasn't it beautiful
[1:29:18] wasn't it glorious it was glorious
[1:29:22] we still talk about it forever talk
[1:29:24] about the seas party
[1:29:27] and them walking over across that was
[1:29:29] god's strength
[1:29:31] i'd like to try i'd like to see them try
[1:29:33] to part that
[1:29:34] and try it out but we need a lot of fans
[1:29:36] a lot of times in the whole couple of
[1:29:38] years isn't that right
[1:29:40] no god just did it in an instant same
[1:29:42] way with the birds same way with water
[1:29:44] from a rock
[1:29:45] his strength is perfect i can make water
[1:29:48] coming out of a dry rock
[1:29:51] what about it where do you get water
[1:29:54] from a rock no
[1:29:55] maybe a spring maybe some dirt bubbling
[1:29:57] up in water
[1:29:58] no but a rock a dry rock and a desert
[1:30:00] gotta do the miraculous
[1:30:02] how many weeks you'll do that in your
[1:30:04] life in my life if you'll be surrendered
[1:30:06] to god
[1:30:09] amen but no like brother bam says he
[1:30:11] listened to what brother brahm said he
[1:30:13] said you know i know
[1:30:14] that's hard it's hard to not let the
[1:30:18] flesh have its way
[1:30:20] amen in those times like god said to
[1:30:23] paul my strength is
[1:30:24] made perfect in weakness my strength
[1:30:27] becomes more perfect as you become
[1:30:30] more weaker
[1:30:35] and the more you can yield to me
[1:30:38] the better i can use you the more you
[1:30:42] forget about
[1:30:43] all that you know education the more you
[1:30:45] forget about your denomination the more
[1:30:46] you can get
[1:30:49] forget about your stuff and i blue line
[1:30:52] the stuff hello let me know sometimes we
[1:30:54] still got stuff
[1:30:56] and yield yourself to me the more i can
[1:30:59] use you
[1:31:00] because you have to become weak
[1:31:05] amen and then i'll make my own purpose
[1:31:11] strong so god can make strength out of
[1:31:14] weakness that's why that's the reason
[1:31:16] that he
[1:31:16] always does it and he always chooses
[1:31:20] weak people amen but don't use that as
[1:31:24] an excuse
[1:31:25] amen so i thought about this in closing
[1:31:29] i thought about it's kind of like this
[1:31:31] because most of us
[1:31:33] we've been being shaped by the lord how
[1:31:35] many has been led by the lord
[1:31:37] god's working a lot of us for a long
[1:31:39] time already
[1:31:40] but you know it's wonderful if you take
[1:31:42] a car and you fix this and you fix that
[1:31:44] perhaps it's in a wreck
[1:31:45] it's in bad shape you fix this you fix
[1:31:47] that but if you drive it down the road
[1:31:50] and let's say the right side of your car
[1:31:52] in the front wheel
[1:31:54] amen the steering rod that goes over
[1:31:57] there to the left it still has a
[1:31:58] real bad bend in it isn't that right and
[1:32:01] it causes that wheel to squall and
[1:32:03] squeak and make
[1:32:04] one or you run off the road and you got
[1:32:06] to fight that thing i want you to run
[1:32:08] off the road right
[1:32:09] guess what it's time to take it back to
[1:32:11] the body shop right
[1:32:12] to cake it up and take that rod off and
[1:32:15] then perhaps heat it up and bend it
[1:32:17] straight again put it a little under
[1:32:19] pressure get it a little fire on it and
[1:32:21] fix that thing and i mean that's what
[1:32:23] god is doing to your life
[1:32:24] and to my life those little areas and
[1:32:26] anybody that raised their hands
[1:32:28] i need more strength let me tell you
[1:32:29] there's still an area in your life
[1:32:32] still an area in my life where god is
[1:32:34] trying to get the whole machine
[1:32:36] oh my don't you like a new vehicle it
[1:32:38] don't have a pulling problem
[1:32:40] how many likes a car with a pulling
[1:32:41] problem i don't like a car with a
[1:32:42] pulling problem
[1:32:43] you know something's wrong they find
[1:32:45] their name in the line right something
[1:32:46] you know is it funny to watch some of
[1:32:50] these people
[1:32:51] you know i would do it if that's all i
[1:32:52] had brother steven i'd go down there i'd
[1:32:54] drive an old chevy truck with the back
[1:32:56] end and going that way you know
[1:32:59] you know it's just something y'all i'm
[1:33:01] seeing right you know they're going down
[1:33:03] like that
[1:33:03] it's just a back end it's a guy it's
[1:33:05] been in the wreck it's in bad shape
[1:33:07] that's where you and i are sometimes you
[1:33:10] might be a truck you might be a
[1:33:12] christian you might be going down the
[1:33:13] road but he sits straight the way it's
[1:33:15] supposed to be amen amen so god's still
[1:33:18] working on us isn't that right
[1:33:20] as we sing that song many times god's
[1:33:22] working on a steel
[1:33:24] amen so god's going to take that one
[1:33:25] little thing in our life
[1:33:27] amen that's still not quite right and he
[1:33:29] still has to take that
[1:33:31] in his shop so to speak and fix it and i
[1:33:33] don't know about you but i've got that
[1:33:35] area say lord
[1:33:36] you know you know where i need fixing
[1:33:38] amen praise the lord
[1:33:42] you think you're so tough but guess what
[1:33:45] amen god has to do like he did with paul
[1:33:47] he has to do like he did
[1:33:49] with david and all these different
[1:33:51] places you know so that you can really
[1:33:53] realize that hey
[1:33:54] it's not me it's all about him
[1:33:58] you realize that without him
[1:34:02] we can do nothing how many is that way
[1:34:04] lord jesus without you
[1:34:06] i can do nothing when i was
[1:34:10] in cancer i was people perhaps you know
[1:34:13] i was
[1:34:13] just gonna die and god came down and he
[1:34:15] delivered me
[1:34:17] amen i was backed up against death got
[1:34:19] in the corner but
[1:34:20] the lord delivered me praise be to god
[1:34:22] you know
[1:34:23] i mean you give god the glory you
[1:34:25] realize you can sing that song with all
[1:34:27] of your heart
[1:34:28] amen his hand reached further down
[1:34:32] then i could reach up amen that's what
[1:34:35] he wanted israel to say that's what he
[1:34:37] wanted all of them to realize hey
[1:34:38] you know he could reach further down
[1:34:40] than what you can reach up
[1:34:41] but you just got to surrender yourself
[1:34:43] and say thank you lord
[1:34:44] you know you have to break me you have
[1:34:46] to break my selfishness my spirit
[1:34:48] amen to where i can just yield to you
[1:34:51] and give god all the glory
[1:34:54] god bless you tonight amen you can stand
[1:34:56] with me if you will musicians
[1:34:57] if you'll come
[1:35:04] amen let's just power heads while
[1:35:06] they're coming
[1:35:07] let's talk to the master
[1:35:11] the one that does these things the ones
[1:35:14] that
[1:35:15] kind of breaks us down in different
[1:35:16] places has to remoles
[1:35:19] a certain area isn't quite right so he
[1:35:21] has to work on that
[1:35:23] because he's getting a bride ready to
[1:35:25] leave this world
[1:35:27] he's getting a bride that has the
[1:35:28] strength of god in her
[1:35:30] and that strength only comes when you
[1:35:32] are weak to yourself
[1:35:34] and completely yielded to him and given
[1:35:36] him the glory
[1:35:37] let him lead your life every aspect of
[1:35:40] it he's got control of
[1:35:42] every aspect then we'll truly become
[1:35:45] strong
[1:35:45] is when we're weak in ourself lord jesus
[1:35:48] we come before you tonight
[1:35:50] we just ask god that you continue lord
[1:35:53] to mold us and shape us into your image
[1:35:55] lord and while we all
[1:35:56] raise our hands saying yes we want more
[1:35:59] strength we want more strength of the
[1:36:00] lord
[1:36:01] but lord if you bring us to that place
[1:36:03] where you have to break us down lock us
[1:36:05] down some
[1:36:05] few places praise break that place where
[1:36:08] we're still not yielded like we
[1:36:10] should be then lord help us to realize
[1:36:12] that's just god working on us
[1:36:14] and getting us to yield so that we can
[1:36:16] see more of the strength of god in our
[1:36:18] life
[1:36:19] and lord jesus i just pray god that
[1:36:21] you'll just take these words tonight
[1:36:22] lord and place it in each heart
[1:36:24] and cause it to draw us closer to you
[1:36:26] lord jesus and make us realize where our
[1:36:29] bad places are our father where we can
[1:36:31] become stronger where we can better
[1:36:33] serve you lord and i thank you father
[1:36:35] that we truly can be
[1:36:37] strength strong when we think about paul
[1:36:39] lord jesus
[1:36:40] how how did he was didn't look like
[1:36:43] anything according to the picture he
[1:36:45] didn't have big arms and strong
[1:36:47] no he was really puny looking but he was
[1:36:50] a spiritual
[1:36:51] giant he was strong in the lord
[1:36:55] leaning on you for everything he gladly
[1:36:58] laid his head on the chopping block
[1:37:00] so that he could come home to be with
[1:37:02] you he was
[1:37:04] brave he was so strong because he had
[1:37:07] you in his soul
[1:37:08] that's what we want we want the holy
[1:37:10] spirit the love of god in our soul
[1:37:13] that'll truly make us strong father we
[1:37:15] ask god your blessing upon each one now
[1:37:17] in jesus name
[1:37:19] amen and amen david sing that little
[1:37:22] course the more that i surrender
[1:37:25] all the more that i
[1:37:28] surrender the lighter
[1:37:34] my lord the more
[1:37:38] that i release my cares
[1:37:43] the more he takes control
[1:37:49] the more that i can humble myself
[1:37:54] the more he lifts me up

[1:38:02] live lord i love you more once again
