[0:35] it's gonna be a beautiful day today we
[0:37] just wanna
[0:39] worship the lord and truth and it sure
[0:41] is good to be in the house of the lord
[0:42] this morning
[0:45] psalms 119 starting in verse 129
[0:50] thy testimonies are wonderful therefore
[0:53] doeth my soul keepeth them
[1:01] i opened my mouth and painted for i
[1:03] longed for thy commandments
[1:13] order my steps in thy word and let not
[1:15] any iniquity have dominion over me
[1:24] make thy face to shine upon thy servant
[1:27] and teach me thy statutes
[1:36] righteous art thou o lord and upright
[1:38] are thy judgments
[1:46] my seal hath consumed me
[1:49] because my enemies have forgotten my
[1:51] words
[1:57] i am small and despised yet do not i
[2:00] forget thy precepts
[2:08] trouble and anguish have taken hold on
[2:10] me yet thy commandments are my delights
[2:14] the righteous of the
[2:16] testimonies of everlasting give me
[2:18] understanding and i shall live god bless
[2:21] you may be seated brother brian
[2:36] morning brothers and sisters
[2:38] hey you would
[2:40] you can turn to the 138th psalm but i
[2:42] was just going to go
[2:44] to this 131st verse here it says i open
[2:47] my mouth and i paint it for our long for
[2:49] thy commandments and
[2:51] the
[2:53] thing that just struck my heart is
[2:56] without mentioning water
[2:58] or the water of life david is talking to
[3:00] us
[3:01] as disciples telling us that the word of
[3:04] god is the living water that we all
[3:06] desire to
[3:08] drink from
[3:09] but turning to the
[3:13] 138th psalm here
[3:20] it's not a very long time
[3:23] i don't know it's been
[3:25] you know it's been several years
[3:27] you know i was um
[3:29] i even got notes from years ago when we
[3:32] i
[3:33] talked here about this
[3:35] but
[3:36] i have that book i don't know if some of
[3:38] you do or not uh from jaw uh mr spurgeon
[3:43] charles spurgeon
[3:44] and he has he does an in-depth study of
[3:47] all 150 psalms
[3:50] and uh i was
[3:52] reading his writing how he explains
[3:54] things and i was thinking
[3:56] you know he we're talking to the guy
[3:59] that was on the face of the earth maybe
[4:01] 130 140 years ago
[4:03] before brother branham was even here
[4:06] and some of the truths that he talks
[4:08] about and i was just thinking this
[4:10] morning
[4:11] you know
[4:12] don't be by people out there in the
[4:14] world you know
[4:15] i'm not afraid and i know you're not
[4:17] afraid to tell someone that you believe
[4:18] the message of the hour and that you
[4:20] believe brother adam was a prophet for
[4:23] the age that we live in
[4:24] but i will have you know a lot of these
[4:26] preachers you hear on the radio and
[4:29] the ones that you interact with if you
[4:31] go into their study
[4:32] they'll have spurgeon's writings all
[4:34] over the place and the difference
[4:36] between you
[4:37] and them
[4:39] is that you don't have to have footnotes
[4:41] because you're not afraid to tell people
[4:43] where you get your truths from where
[4:45] you're getting your inspiration from but
[4:47] if you listen to a lot of messages out
[4:49] there if you read
[4:51] old the old fathers in the in
[4:53] christianity whether it's wesley or
[4:55] spurgeon or anyone else you can hear the
[4:58] theme from the preachers you know what
[5:00] they're doing in their studies they're
[5:03] opening a book aspersion or they're open
[5:05] one of wesley's
[5:07] he has a series of his preaching that he
[5:09] preached you know where they're going to
[5:11] get their inspiration from they just
[5:13] they're just not telling you where
[5:15] they're getting their the messages
[5:17] they're right now from but if they were
[5:19] professors without the footnotes they
[5:21] wouldn't have a job so don't be afraid
[5:23] of
[5:24] letting people know what you believe or
[5:26] who who you believe in or what you
[5:28] believe shouldn't be afraid
[5:30] are they going to laugh at you you have
[5:32] no control over that
[5:34] and i know as as men and women i only
[5:37] can speak for men you know no one likes
[5:39] to be ridiculed no one likes to be made
[5:41] fun of but if you know what you believe
[5:43] is the truth no matter what people say
[5:45] to you
[5:46] you might not like it your flesh won't
[5:48] like it but you have nothing to fear or
[5:51] nothing to be afraid of
[5:53] and you know that's the age that we live
[5:55] in um
[5:57] i haven't even got started the age that
[5:58] we live in is trying to bind you
[6:01] into a position when you're afraid
[6:03] to tell the people that you interact
[6:05] with every day what you believe or how
[6:07] you feel it's the very age that we live
[6:09] in is trying to bind people
[6:12] so they are afraid to speak what they
[6:14] believe or tell people what they but so
[6:17] i'm not using the terms they use out
[6:19] there in the world but that's the way it
[6:20] is trying to bind everybody into one
[6:23] image
[6:24] and
[6:25] you just gotta refuse to have people tie
[6:27] you up in their ideology or in their
[6:30] truth just don't be afraid to speak what
[6:33] you believe and that's the problem right
[6:36] now
[6:37] you know you i talked you know spending
[6:38] all those years in the middle east
[6:41] you know seeing what islam is like in
[6:43] the middle east i don't know why i'm
[6:44] going here yet
[6:45] you know being around islamic people
[6:47] being around muslims all my life
[6:50] seeing how they are and how they
[6:51] interact with their populations i've
[6:54] always known when you have populations
[6:56] that have a muslim population over 80
[6:59] percent i can guarantee you they will
[7:01] not tolerate any other religion or any
[7:04] other way of life other than their way
[7:05] life this is true they are they believe
[7:07] in what they believe in so dogmatically
[7:10] that they won't allow anyone else to
[7:12] have another opinion and you see it
[7:14] whether it's islam whether it's hindu
[7:17] whether it's any religion that binding
[7:19] you as a christian where you can't say
[7:21] what you think about that religion or
[7:23] about that way well it's in the same in
[7:25] a secular way they're trying to bind you
[7:28] or you can't say that this behavior is
[7:30] wrong or that behavior is right it's the
[7:32] age that we're living you just got to
[7:34] push it away and not conform to it i
[7:37] mean doesn't mean that everyone's going
[7:38] to like you you can't make people like
[7:40] you but i'd rather have god like me then
[7:43] be friends with everyone else but uh
[7:46] i'll just read the psalm here
[7:48] you know i do enjoy reading spurgeon's
[7:50] writings you know uh
[7:52] before we moved up here we were still in
[7:54] the old trump church
[7:56] and uh brother andy's older brother
[7:58] andy's was down there and he he kind of
[8:00] said the same thing
[8:02] he he read
[8:03] a portion out of
[8:05] uh brother spurgeon's writings and one
[8:07] of the things that he said that day
[8:10] was the ministers in your denominational
[8:13] churches
[8:14] brother spurgeon said without holiness
[8:17] no man is going to see god it's without
[8:19] holiness and now of course the world out
[8:22] there when you say that they mean that's
[8:23] holiness of the heart but once you've
[8:25] got god inside your heart it should be
[8:28] manifesting itself in your life you
[8:30] can't have one without the other does
[8:32] that mean a christian that's only been
[8:34] served in the lord a few months is going
[8:36] to be automatically changed and doing
[8:38] right no but from the inside out your
[8:41] life should be changing day after day
[8:44] year after year you shouldn't be the
[8:46] same mold of clay you were 20 years ago
[8:49] you should be different in everything as
[8:51] you move on but i'll just read the psalm
[8:54] this morning
[8:57] it's only eight verses
[8:59] i will praise thee with my whole heart
[9:01] before the gods will i sing praise unto
[9:03] thee
[9:04] i will worship toward thy holy temple
[9:06] and praise thy name for thy love and
[9:08] kindness
[9:09] and for thy truth for thou is magnify
[9:12] thy word above all
[9:14] all thy name
[9:17] in the day when i cried thou answered me
[9:19] and strengthens me with strength in my
[9:22] soul
[9:23] and all the kings of the earth shall
[9:24] praise thee o lord when they hear the
[9:26] words of thy mouth
[9:28] they shall sing in the ways of the lord
[9:31] for great is
[9:32] the lord
[9:34] i yet he have respect onto the lowly you
[9:38] know that's an important thought right
[9:40] there no matter where you're at i don't
[9:42] care how low you are if you're laying on
[9:44] the street poor and you can't beat
[9:45] yourself from that state all the way to
[9:47] the richest person in the world god
[9:49] cares about you
[9:51] the lord yah yet he respects unto the
[9:53] lowly but the proud he knoweth a far off
[9:56] you know you can be a rich man
[9:59] and still be a christian but that but
[10:01] david's or a poor man still be a
[10:03] christian it's it that has nothing to do
[10:06] with it it's a relationship with jesus
[10:08] christ and out of that relationship
[10:11] whether you have wealth or don't have
[10:13] wealth you're going to use it for the
[10:15] kingdom of god and he goes though i walk
[10:17] in the midst of trouble that will
[10:20] the thou stretcheth forth thy hand
[10:22] against the wrath of my enemies
[10:24] and my right hand shall save me
[10:27] the lord will perfect that which
[10:29] concerneth me the mercy o lord and
[10:31] excuse me thy mercy o lord endureth
[10:33] forever
[10:34] forsake not the works of thine hands and
[10:37] i was gonna just go back to these first
[10:39] two verses this morning
[10:42] uh
[10:43] before i go go on another tangent here
[10:46] but uh
[10:47] he talks about the first thing
[10:49] the second verse i will worship toward
[10:51] thy holy temple and i will praise thine
[10:53] i am in love and kindness for thy truth
[10:56] as thou magnify thy word is above all
[10:59] thy name
[11:00] and then i would just say
[11:03] david said in this first verse i will
[11:05] praise thee with my whole heart before
[11:07] the gods will i sing pray
[11:10] so that goes back a little bit earlier
[11:12] what i was saying uh no matter where
[11:14] you're at i don't false gods no matter
[11:17] what situations out there in the world
[11:19] you shouldn't be afraid to praise the
[11:21] lord in any given situation no matter
[11:23] whether they ridicule you make fun of
[11:26] you no matter what they do to you but
[11:28] let me uh
[11:29] i was gonna go to a scripture i don't
[11:31] know
[11:33] you know we that temple you know the
[11:35] word of god that temple
[11:38] um
[11:40] is i'll just turn here real quick
[11:48] the one thing i have learned my whole
[11:50] life the more time you give the lord in
[11:53] your life the more time you give him
[11:56] spend with him the better off you are
[11:58] the further you get away from the worse
[12:00] you are but uh i'll just this goes to
[12:03] the you know the temple of god
[12:05] is pretty simple and i'll just read what
[12:07] it says and i this is the 20 you don't
[12:09] have to turn here i know i'm jumping all
[12:11] over the place but the 21st verse of
[12:14] revelation it says and this is speaking
[12:17] for the time to come
[12:18] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[12:21] for the first heaven and the first earth
[12:22] were passed away and there was no more
[12:25] seed
[12:26] and i john saw the holy city the new
[12:28] jerusalem coming down from god out of
[12:30] heaven prepared as the bride to adorn
[12:33] her husband
[12:34] heard a great voice out of heaven saying
[12:36] behold the tabernacle of god is with men
[12:39] and he will dwell with him and they
[12:41] shall be his people and god himself
[12:43] shall be with them and be their god so
[12:46] i've said this before we know who
[12:49] everything that god was i don't have to
[12:51] say you already know in your minds
[12:53] everything that god was he poured into
[12:56] christ and what christ is you could see
[12:58] the direct representation
[13:01] in the scriptures or in your life
[13:03] whatever god was christ was and what
[13:06] christ was he wants you to be it's a
[13:07] pretty simple
[13:09] thought right there you know don't be
[13:11] afraid
[13:12] of what you believe and who you are
[13:14] there's more than a you know what is it
[13:17] they say you'd be surprised how many
[13:19] people that you run across that
[13:21] though you see
[13:23] you might see something hard on the
[13:24] outside something shallow on the outside
[13:28] but you don't know what god's doing on

[46:22] [Music]
[46:36] glorious day
[46:38] that will be
[46:42] amen good to be in the house of the lord
[46:44] this morning
[46:46] you happy to be a christian
[46:47] amen
[46:49] amen i tell you we've we've had some
[46:51] good thoughts come across the pulpit
[46:53] lately and
[46:54] the attributes of god and thanking
[46:56] musicians i appreciate it um
[46:58] your gifts for the lord is greatly
[47:00] appreciated so
[47:02] uh the attributes of god and uh the
[47:05] evidence of the holy ghost and some of
[47:06] the things we've been talking about and
[47:08] brother byler and so
[47:10] god certainly been good god certainly
[47:12] seems to be preparing
[47:14] preparing people
[47:16] and
[47:17] so
[47:18] with that in mind i hope you come
[47:19] expecting this morning
[47:21] did you come expecting
[47:22] because if you come expecting this
[47:24] morning and you come desiring something
[47:26] from god god is obligated that's an
[47:28] obligation he has to meet if you've
[47:30] prayed and you come expecting and you've
[47:32] got your cup up and say god i'll need
[47:34] something from you i want you to to pour
[47:36] out your spirit in me god he's obligated
[47:39] to do that
[47:40] so i trust you've come expecting this
[47:42] morning
[47:44] i want to turn if we could into the
[47:46] bible this morning in the book of
[47:47] galatians now you're probably thinking
[47:49] we're going to go to genesis wouldn't
[47:50] you
[47:53] no not genesis we're going to go to
[47:55] galatians
[47:58] so galatians chapter 5.
[48:01] we're going to take a little thought out
[48:02] of there and i want to just speak on
[48:04] walking in the spirit this morning
[48:08] galatians 5
[48:10] and 16 is where we will where we'll go
[48:19] brother mike i seem to be getting a lot
[48:20] of rebound i don't know if it's coming
[48:23] through the monitors or or what but you
[48:25] might look at that
[48:27] galatians 5 and 16.
[48:30] this i say then
[48:32] walk in the spirit
[48:34] and ye shall not fulfill
[48:37] the lust
[48:39] of the flesh
[48:41] so how do we overcome the flesh we walk
[48:44] in the spirit
[48:45] simple right
[48:47] not so much let's read the next one for
[48:49] the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[48:51] hell we got a battle going now we
[48:53] constantly are in a battle if we're in
[48:55] this life we're battling
[48:57] so the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[48:59] and the spirit against the flesh and
[49:01] these are contrary to the one to the
[49:03] other
[49:05] so that you cannot do the things that
[49:07] you would
[49:09] but if you be led of the spirit
[49:11] ye are not under the law now that's a
[49:14] great place to be right there led by the
[49:16] spirit so that the law does not rule
[49:18] your life
[49:20] none of us can make it on the merits of
[49:22] ourself and none of us can make it on
[49:25] law
[49:27] if you think you can make it on law i'm
[49:29] afraid you're going to be surprised
[49:33] now the works of the flesh are manifest
[49:36] which are these
[49:38] adultery fornication uncleanliness
[49:40] lasciviousness
[49:42] that means lustful sexual desire if you
[49:44] didn't know what that means
[49:46] idolatry witchcraft hatred variants
[49:48] emulations wrath strife seditions
[49:51] heresies envyings murders
[49:54] drunkenness revelings and such like of
[49:56] which i tell you before as i have also
[49:59] told you in time past
[50:01] that they which do such things what's to
[50:04] say shall not
[50:06] inherit the kingdom of god and paul has
[50:09] told him this at least twice he said
[50:11] i've told you this before and i'm going
[50:12] to tell you again if you're
[50:14] participating and partaking of these
[50:16] things
[50:17] you're not going to make it into the
[50:18] kingdom of god
[50:23] now if we stop right there we're all in
[50:26] trouble
[50:28] but thank god there's more to the word
[50:30] and paul says but the fruit of the
[50:33] spirit
[50:34] notice that the fruit of the spirit
[50:38] is love joy peace longsuffering
[50:41] gentleness goodness
[50:42] faith meekness temperance and against
[50:45] such there is no law
[50:48] that's a big that's a mouthful right
[50:50] there there is no law
[50:53] and they that are
[50:55] that are christ have crucified the flesh
[50:58] with the affections and lust and if we
[51:01] live in the spirit let us also walk in
[51:03] the spirit
[51:04] let us not be desirous of vainglory
[51:07] provoking one another
[51:09] envied one another
[51:11] amen
[51:12] let's bow our heads heavenly father
[51:14] we thank you lord for this day you've
[51:16] given us lord to opportunity to come and
[51:18] fellowship into your house this morning
[51:20] and
[51:21] just fellowship around the word of god
[51:23] and the breath of life as we partake of
[51:25] it lord and lord as we're looking at
[51:27] these thoughts this morning
[51:28] and walking in the spirit
[51:30] we see the importance of being able to
[51:33] dedicate our lives in such a way that
[51:35] you can move in our vessels and fulfill
[51:38] all of these lord jesus we don't want to
[51:40] be those partaking of the things of this
[51:42] evil world and the things that's going
[51:43] on because we can't make it that way we
[51:45] can't make it on law we need we need
[51:47] love we need grace we need long
[51:49] suffering we need meekness gentleness
[51:51] kindness we need all those things lord
[51:53] and we ask or that you would just break
[51:55] it down this morning for us and and help
[51:57] us to see where we're at in the in the
[51:59] word and then the message of the hour
[52:01] and where we're at in your program god
[52:03] and lord this message is to help us to
[52:05] grow is to help us to to learn and to
[52:07] get closer to you father as our hearts
[52:09] desire is to be close to you father and
[52:12] to be uh
[52:13] first in your program lord we just want
[52:15] to tell you we love you we appreciate
[52:16] you we lift up our pastor this morning
[52:19] and just ask you touch his body would
[52:20] you restore his health to him
[52:23] and lord just
[52:24] give him a great day of rest that he
[52:26] could be himself again this week and
[52:28] lord we just ask lord that you just
[52:29] bless this church in a mighty way lord
[52:32] as our hearts are to draw close to you
[52:35] and to make that rapture that's our
[52:36] number one goal we can't miss it we
[52:39] cannot miss it lord and we know that we
[52:42] love you lord and give your honor praise
[52:44] and glory in jesus name amen you can
[52:46] have your seats
[52:53] i'm going to
[52:54] try not to hold you but
[52:57] i told
[52:58] sister joyce i said
[53:00] i tell you what i you know in my mind
[53:03] you think you've got a thought and you
[53:05] think you're gonna go one direction and
[53:06] then it goes in another and you think
[53:08] man you think i'm gonna it's gonna be
[53:10] good today we're gonna you know we're
[53:12] gonna get with it and then all of a
[53:13] sudden you're thinking man i just want
[53:15] to get off the platform
[53:17] so it's one of those you feel like you
[53:19] could just throw your notes in the air
[53:20] pick them up and go and and i'm not
[53:23] going to throw my nose in there i'm not
[53:24] that bold but we are just going to try
[53:26] to pick it up and go but we look at this
[53:28] and we look at these scriptures here and
[53:30] and we begin to think and we find out
[53:33] many times people try to
[53:35] produce
[53:37] and they try to manufacture
[53:39] so to speak their christian behaviors
[53:43] so they try to manufacture love they
[53:45] want to have the appearance of love they
[53:46] want to have the appearance of
[53:48] gentleness they want to have the the
[53:50] appearance of of peace they want people
[53:52] to think they are that but deep down
[53:54] inside sometimes they're not being able
[53:56] to to produce it and push it out
[53:58] naturally through the spirit of god but
[54:00] they're producing it on the flesh and as
[54:02] an image they're putting out before the
[54:04] people
[54:05] and the prophet tells us in this in this
[54:07] little story here he says you know a
[54:09] sheep
[54:10] is a very sensitive and odd animal
[54:13] he said you know the sheep never was
[54:16] asked to manufacture wool
[54:18] but he was asked to bear wool
[54:22] because he's a sheep and as long as he's
[54:24] a sheep he will bear wool because that's
[54:27] his nature
[54:28] and so it is with the christian church
[54:31] we're never asked to manufacture fruits
[54:34] he said we're asked to bear fruit he
[54:38] says galatians 5 says the fruit of the
[54:40] spirit is love joy faith peace long
[54:42] suffering meekness gentleness patience
[54:45] these are not to be manufactured no he
[54:47] says but these are products that come
[54:50] from the inside
[54:52] out
[54:53] they come from here they come from the
[54:55] inside out and he says the outside life
[54:59] that we live
[55:01] proves
[55:02] what's on the inside
[55:05] he said now we have tried to manufacture
[55:07] this we've tried to manufacture the
[55:10] fruits of the spirit and we always turn
[55:12] out hypocrisy he said because you can't
[55:15] manufacture christianity
[55:19] he said it's an experience by a spirit
[55:22] that lives in you
[55:24] and it bears the fruit itself you can't
[55:27] manufacture we've tried to educate it he
[55:29] said we tried to denominate it and we
[55:31] turn out hypocrisy and failure and it's
[55:33] not to be done that way
[55:37] don't try it is what he's saying
[55:40] don't try to do it that way it's going
[55:42] to produce failure in your life it's
[55:44] going to produce an image that shows
[55:45] hypocrisy in your life but let let the
[55:48] spirit of god live through you and do it
[55:51] god's way he says it's to be done as god
[55:54] intended it to be done the spirit inside
[55:56] bearing fruits of his presence and
[55:58] that's god's program and it can never be
[56:02] changed
[56:07] so i want to look this morning
[56:10] at the fruit of the spirit or walking in
[56:12] the spirit
[56:13] and brothers and sisters i believe
[56:15] that god is putting the
[56:17] finishing touches on his church
[56:20] i believe that there is a bride of jesus
[56:22] christ that has got to come to the
[56:25] fullness of who she is i believe that
[56:27] there is a bride that has to be fully
[56:30] identified
[56:31] with her place in the word in the
[56:33] message of the hour i believe that she
[56:35] has to be able to uh place herself in
[56:37] that word she has to be filled with a
[56:39] spirit and i believe she has to be able
[56:41] to operate under the authority of jesus
[56:44] christ
[56:47] a lot of times we want to operate as
[56:49] christians but why are we operating
[56:50] under the authority of jesus christ
[56:53] let me tell you what the difference is
[56:54] he said that there he said i found
[56:56] there's two classes of people he said
[56:58] i've found that there's fundamentalists
[57:00] and he said and on the other hand
[57:02] there's pentecostals
[57:04] so we can look back into the 50s and 60s
[57:06] right when he was preaching this and we
[57:07] realized the two groups of people that
[57:09] he was right in the middle with and he
[57:11] was being pulled in different directions
[57:13] and on one hand you had the
[57:14] fundamentalists that had the word they
[57:15] had the scripture they had the doctrine
[57:17] they had everything and on the other
[57:19] hand he had the pentecostals who had the
[57:21] spirit they had the movements they had
[57:23] the gifts and they had all these
[57:25] things taking place but he says there's
[57:27] two people there and he said the
[57:29] fundamentalists pers positionally don't
[57:32] know where they are positionally they
[57:33] know where they stand but they have
[57:35] never received the holy ghost
[57:39] we've got to be careful when we get that
[57:40] we don't get so uh uh so much
[57:44] it's hard to say it this way but we
[57:45] don't put so much emphasis on the
[57:48] doctrines
[57:49] that we forget the one who gave the
[57:51] doctrines
[57:53] we got to be able to associate with the
[57:55] spirit that gave the word
[57:57] as well as we do the word as it came so
[58:00] he said it's fundamentalist they got the
[58:02] word but they never received the holy
[58:03] ghost they haven't got faith
[58:06] hmm they haven't got faith he said
[58:09] that's right in the pentecostals he says
[58:11] they've received the holy ghost but
[58:13] positionally they don't know who they
[58:14] are
[58:17] so here he's talking about two groups of
[58:19] people it says let me liken it to you
[58:20] like this he said it's like a man who's
[58:23] got all the money in the bank he could
[58:25] want
[58:26] but he can't write a check
[58:30] he's got all the money he could he could
[58:32] buy the world over but yet he doesn't
[58:34] know how to write the check maybe he
[58:35] doesn't know how to sign his name he
[58:37] doesn't know how to fill out a check
[58:39] he said but then you got on the other
[58:40] hand you got somebody that can write a
[58:42] check but ain't got no money in the bank
[58:46] the two different people here now watch
[58:48] what he says he says you could get if
[58:50] you could get them both together
[58:52] you'd have it settled
[58:54] see what i say you got to have the
[58:56] importance of the fundamentals of the
[58:58] doctrine
[58:59] and the spirit
[59:01] they have to coexist together they have
[59:03] to go together they have to dovetail
[59:04] together
[59:05] he says if we can get those two together
[59:07] he said if you can get the pentecostal
[59:09] faith and the fundamental church and the
[59:11] fundamental teaching in the pentecostal
[59:12] church you'd have it made
[59:19] is that you're right
[59:20] then the great church of god would stand
[59:23] to its feet
[59:26] so you're telling me that if they could
[59:28] have come to agreeance
[59:30] doctrine and spirit if god could have
[59:32] moved on both of them and got them both
[59:33] together right then and there there
[59:35] would have been a movement that would
[59:36] have caused the church to stand and rise
[59:38] to its feet
[59:39] and here we are in 2021
[59:43] and we're still treading on this on this
[59:46] ground
[59:47] that there hasn't been a rapture to take
[59:49] place is this the two things that's
[59:50] holding us up doctrine and spirit
[59:53] we've got to get the two together so
[59:55] that they dovetail together he says
[59:57] listen he says when the two come
[59:58] together you have a right
[1:00:02] you have a god-given privilege to every
[1:00:04] divine promise in the book
[1:00:07] and it's yours
[1:00:09] he said i know that truth by experience
[1:00:13] so let me ask you this morning
[1:00:15] would you agree with me and say that
[1:00:18] you want an endless supply of god this
[1:00:20] morning
[1:00:22] would you agree with me this morning and
[1:00:23] say god all that you are all that you
[1:00:25] ever was and all that you ever will be
[1:00:27] god it's my desire that you would pour
[1:00:29] it out on to me this morning so that god
[1:00:32] so that i could look at this and be a
[1:00:34] mirror image of you lord
[1:00:37] so that god that when i look at myself i
[1:00:40] can see that i've got the very same
[1:00:42] attributes as you god the father
[1:00:48] that ought to be our desire that god
[1:00:50] would give us everything he was and last
[1:00:52] time i spoke i spoke on the evidence of
[1:00:54] the holy ghost and by their fruits you
[1:00:56] shall know them
[1:00:58] so this morning why don't we spend a
[1:00:59] little time as we look at these fruits
[1:01:01] and spend a little time and look at
[1:01:03] those fruits and see what makes up those
[1:01:05] fruits
[1:01:06] what exactly is it that goes into this
[1:01:09] fruit that paul's talking about
[1:01:12] what is it that paul is trying to tell
[1:01:14] us now if i ask you what comes to your
[1:01:16] mind when you see this apple
[1:01:19] you see the apple
[1:01:21] everybody in this building has got a
[1:01:24] thought of what that apple is
[1:01:29] so in your mind maybe you're thinking i
[1:01:31] like apples
[1:01:34] maybe you're thinking you know apples
[1:01:35] are good
[1:01:36] apples are tasty
[1:01:38] apples are sweet
[1:01:40] apples are crunchy
[1:01:42] apples are juicy apples are refreshing
[1:01:46] whatever it is it don't matter it's not
[1:01:47] it's not it's not a test don't don't get
[1:01:50] stuck up on me
[1:01:51] but in your mind you have a thought
[1:01:54] of exactly an image of what that apple
[1:01:56] is and what it's supposed to be to you
[1:02:00] and god has the same kind of thoughts
[1:02:02] when he looks down he has the same kind
[1:02:04] of thoughts of what the image of a holy
[1:02:07] ghost field fundamentally sound
[1:02:10] christian should look like
[1:02:13] only he's not looking at apples
[1:02:15] he's looking at children
[1:02:17] the only other difference is his opinion
[1:02:19] doesn't change
[1:02:21] the way your opinion is different or
[1:02:23] this one's different maybe you don't
[1:02:24] like apples god loves his children
[1:02:26] so god is looking at this and he says if
[1:02:28] i can look down here i want to get the
[1:02:29] image of these just right and so paul
[1:02:32] talks about this in the book of
[1:02:33] galatians in chapter five as we read and
[1:02:36] it's important to know that as paul
[1:02:37] wrote this letter
[1:02:40] he wrote this letter to the galatians
[1:02:44] and this letter
[1:02:45] has been called the declaration of
[1:02:47] independence of christian liberty
[1:02:51] that's what scholars
[1:02:54] i'm no bible scholar i just read and
[1:02:56] research
[1:02:57] that's what they say this letter is it's
[1:02:59] the declaration of independence of
[1:03:01] christian
[1:03:02] liberty
[1:03:04] martin luther
[1:03:05] he loved this letter and i heard brother
[1:03:07] brian talking about the different ones a
[1:03:09] different spurgeon and luther and
[1:03:12] all these different ones
[1:03:15] but he says he was so passionate about
[1:03:17] this letter
[1:03:19] and he he says i call the galatian
[1:03:22] letter my catherine von bora that was
[1:03:26] his wife
[1:03:27] and he named the the book of goliath or
[1:03:29] the letter of the galatians catherine
[1:03:30] von bohr because he says i'm married to
[1:03:33] this letter
[1:03:34] this letter is so important i'm married
[1:03:36] to it this letter is a letter that is a
[1:03:39] passionate letter it's an outpouring of
[1:03:41] the soul of a preacher who's on fire for
[1:03:43] the lord paul
[1:03:44] and he's pouring out his heart and he's
[1:03:46] trying to get the deeply commitment
[1:03:48] committed here is to understand about
[1:03:50] the faith and faith of christ
[1:03:54] and he's pouring out his heart
[1:03:57] this letter brothers and sisters
[1:04:00] is the written proof from the apostle
[1:04:02] paul that every believer has been set
[1:04:04] free
[1:04:07] that every believer and the message of
[1:04:09] the hour that every believer everybody
[1:04:11] that calls upon the name of christ and
[1:04:12] lives a christian life that the bondage
[1:04:14] has been broken for them and they can
[1:04:16] live the life of a spirit-filled
[1:04:18] believer
[1:04:20] are you with me
[1:04:24] paul says
[1:04:31] at the very first of galatians chapter
[1:04:33] five
[1:04:34] the first thing he says is
[1:04:36] stand fast
[1:04:39] stand fast
[1:04:40] therefore in the liberty by which christ
[1:04:43] has made us free
[1:04:45] so the truth is that jesus christ has
[1:04:48] made us
[1:04:49] free
[1:04:50] and
[1:04:51] we're not to live in a
[1:04:53] bondage
[1:04:54] to jesus christ
[1:04:56] we're not to have to follow a legal
[1:04:58] relationship with jesus christ
[1:05:02] and i believe if we ever get that
[1:05:03] thought through to believers
[1:05:05] across the across the world we'll find
[1:05:08] the spirit of god moving in such a
[1:05:10] mighty way
[1:05:11] because it's so easy to want to have the
[1:05:13] do's and the don'ts
[1:05:15] and it's so easy to follow and listen
[1:05:17] and say well he said he said he said he
[1:05:20] said but he also said
[1:05:24] god is love
[1:05:26] he says the fruits of the spirit are and
[1:05:28] god is love
[1:05:30] he listed them he didn't he didn't say
[1:05:33] that we had to be under such bond and
[1:05:35] paul is bringing that out to this people
[1:05:36] of galatia because they lived under such
[1:05:38] law that paul said you'll never make it
[1:05:42] you'll never make it if you keep living
[1:05:44] like you're living
[1:05:49] and god
[1:05:50] is constantly
[1:05:52] trying to reach out to us
[1:05:54] god is constantly reaching out and he's
[1:05:57] pleading with us
[1:05:59] and god is reaching up and saying take
[1:06:01] my hand you need my strength
[1:06:05] and let me tell you it don't matter how
[1:06:07] deep a pitch you're in
[1:06:10] i watched a little story on the
[1:06:12] facebook showed up
[1:06:15] in the last day or so
[1:06:17] and it kind of went along with this
[1:06:20] and it was over spain or somewhere like
[1:06:22] that they were speaking it looked like
[1:06:24] spanish looked like spain somewhere
[1:06:25] along that line there
[1:06:28] and a small child
[1:06:30] had fallen down into the well shaft
[1:06:35] and these these rescuers were just
[1:06:37] frantic they were in a panic and they
[1:06:38] had backhoes and trackhoes and they were
[1:06:40] digging beside it and they were looking
[1:06:42] down with lights and you could hear that
[1:06:44] baby down in there crying
[1:06:46] and they're wondering what are we going
[1:06:47] to do what are we going to do how are we
[1:06:49] going to get down there i'm talking feet
[1:06:51] down there they were just letting rope
[1:06:53] down one after another
[1:06:57] and you could see i couldn't understand
[1:06:59] a word they were saying but you could
[1:07:00] see the picture
[1:07:02] no doubt it was a young child's daddy
[1:07:04] and he was crying and he was frantic and
[1:07:06] he was and he walked over and he ran
[1:07:08] over to this young boy and he was
[1:07:09] talking to him and just giving it all to
[1:07:11] him that he could and that boy shook his
[1:07:12] head
[1:07:14] this little boy is 14 years old just
[1:07:16] wiry and stringy are you with me
[1:07:21] they called the little boy over he shook
[1:07:22] his head yes they put a harness around
[1:07:24] his waist and tied the rope around his
[1:07:26] feet as tight as i could
[1:07:28] they lowered that little boy down into
[1:07:30] that well shaft
[1:07:32] feet after feet after feet after feet
[1:07:35] after feet
[1:07:39] and they shh
[1:07:40] hush everybody hush
[1:07:44] then they started pulling back up
[1:07:47] one after another one after another
[1:07:50] and you see the young 14 year old boy
[1:07:52] feet come and they pull up you know what
[1:07:53] he's got to hold in his hands
[1:07:55] he's got a hope to their little infant
[1:07:57] he's got to hold that and that's what
[1:07:59] god does us he doesn't care how far down
[1:08:01] in the pit we go
[1:08:03] you'll send whatever it takes to pull us
[1:08:05] out and he'll go to the depths of the
[1:08:07] sea to get you where you need to be
[1:08:10] the little 14 year old boy was a hero
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:17] god don't forget us wherever we're at
[1:08:22] so god is constantly reaching out
[1:08:26] and he says take my hand
[1:08:28] you need my strength and walk in the
[1:08:30] freedom that i've got
[1:08:32] and don't get entangled
[1:08:36] in the yoke of bondage
[1:08:38] again
[1:08:40] do you think that little boy was ever
[1:08:41] going to go back and look into that
[1:08:43] shaft again
[1:08:46] i'm sure that little boy learned his
[1:08:47] lesson i'm sure he looked like a
[1:08:49] curiosity about got the best of him but
[1:08:51] he's not going to go back down into that
[1:08:52] same thing that got him in the bondage
[1:08:54] he was in
[1:09:00] and brother and sister we don't make
[1:09:01] ourself
[1:09:04] free we we try
[1:09:08] but we can't make ourselves free because
[1:09:10] freedom is a gift of jesus christ
[1:09:13] and every service we have to bring jesus
[1:09:15] christ into the picture or we're missing
[1:09:16] it because without jesus christ we don't
[1:09:18] exist without jesus christ we have no
[1:09:21] freedom because freedom was paid on the
[1:09:24] cross of calvary freedom was a painful
[1:09:26] price freedom was a humiliating price
[1:09:29] but yet this freedom is given to us
[1:09:32] freely
[1:09:37] what a loving god he is
[1:09:40] what a loving god he is
[1:09:43] so why do we try to free ourselves
[1:09:51] you know when we try to free ourselves
[1:09:54] we find ourselves getting
[1:09:56] in deeper entanglement than we was to
[1:09:58] begin with
[1:10:00] yeah
[1:10:01] we try to do things our way
[1:10:04] we try to cut a little corner here or
[1:10:06] there and say well god probably didn't
[1:10:08] mean this he probably didn't mean that
[1:10:10] he he he probably don't didn't care a
[1:10:13] whole lot about if if i did this or i
[1:10:15] did that
[1:10:17] and we're trying to make ourselves free
[1:10:19] we're trying to give ourselves the
[1:10:20] freedom
[1:10:22] that's not ours to give
[1:10:27] we start living on the edge
[1:10:29] start living
[1:10:30] [Music]
[1:10:31] on that edge of life
[1:10:33] and we get deeper and deeper
[1:10:36] and deeper
[1:10:38] it's like a spider web
[1:10:41] you know it's this time of the year and
[1:10:42] spiders are everywhere
[1:10:46] some of us don't like them
[1:10:51] but i was going out the back door the
[1:10:52] other day
[1:10:53] and you know how when you're in a
[1:10:54] routine you just open the door and you
[1:10:56] walk and i took a step i said whoa
[1:11:02] it was a spider web this big
[1:11:04] all the way across my back door
[1:11:07] and you know i've gotten in those webs
[1:11:09] before in my life and they're no fun
[1:11:11] have you ever walked into him you're
[1:11:12] gonna tell me and you just you're
[1:11:14] pulling and you're turning you can't and
[1:11:15] you just know that spider's in there
[1:11:17] somewhere
[1:11:18] and you you're doing everything you can
[1:11:20] to get that thing off of you
[1:11:22] and that's the way we do when we try to
[1:11:23] free ourselves we get ourselves so
[1:11:26] tangled in the web
[1:11:28] of satan
[1:11:30] you know he's in there
[1:11:32] and you try to fight you try to battle
[1:11:34] but yet you can't find your way out and
[1:11:37] people think that's freedom
[1:11:40] no that's not freedom but they they
[1:11:42] think freedom is doing whatever you want
[1:11:43] to do
[1:11:47] well that's the terrible shape our world
[1:11:48] is living in
[1:11:50] that's why we have antifa
[1:11:54] we'll get a little political here for
[1:11:55] just a second
[1:11:56] but when they take christ out that's
[1:11:59] what comes in
[1:12:00] when they reject the freedom that god
[1:12:02] has given
[1:12:04] that's what comes in you get antifa you
[1:12:05] get homosexuality you get transgender
[1:12:08] you get a socialistic movement like we
[1:12:09] see in our nation right now
[1:12:12] that's what's happening right now
[1:12:13] because god is and they want to be in
[1:12:15] control it's their freedom i have a
[1:12:18] right
[1:12:19] we don't have right to anything
[1:12:22] it's only by god
[1:12:24] they're living their life in a false
[1:12:26] liberty
[1:12:28] there's no freedom there we say we live
[1:12:31] in the land of the free but we're under
[1:12:32] more bondage than we've ever been before
[1:12:36] and their lives prove it
[1:12:38] because they're living contrary to the
[1:12:41] fruit of the spirit
[1:12:44] if let me tell you if we don't walk in
[1:12:45] the fruit of the spirit you're going to
[1:12:46] be right there with them
[1:12:49] that's that's a serious statement but i
[1:12:50] mean it with all i've got
[1:12:53] if we don't walk in the fruit of the
[1:12:54] spirit we'll be right there with them
[1:12:59] but as believers
[1:13:02] paul
[1:13:03] said you don't have to live
[1:13:05] under that tyranny no more
[1:13:07] paul says you're free from all those
[1:13:09] things paul says you're free from having
[1:13:11] to earn your way to god people try to
[1:13:14] earn their way they try to pay here pay
[1:13:16] there do this do that if i could just do
[1:13:18] this for god i know he'll accept me
[1:13:20] that's not what it's about and paul says
[1:13:22] you're free from having to earn your way
[1:13:24] to god you're free from sin you're free
[1:13:28] from guilt you're free from death you're
[1:13:30] free from hell add anything in there
[1:13:32] that you want to that applies to your
[1:13:34] life that satan has bound you by paul
[1:13:37] says you're free from you're free from
[1:13:41] you what will you got you're free from
[1:13:43] anything that you could that could
[1:13:44] possibly plague you you're free from
[1:13:45] hatred you're free from envy malice
[1:13:48] anxiety fear doubt lust
[1:13:53] it's hitting somebody here
[1:13:55] because we're human beings
[1:13:59] and it's like brother byler said
[1:14:01] as long as we're here
[1:14:03] this
[1:14:06] this is our problem
[1:14:09] this is our enemy
[1:14:14] we're free
[1:14:15] and paul says stand fast
[1:14:17] stand fast means it's going to take some
[1:14:19] effort
[1:14:22] why is it we think when we come to
[1:14:24] christ it's all just
[1:14:26] going to be just easy easy road
[1:14:29] you think man i've lived the life of the
[1:14:31] world and this happened and that
[1:14:32] happened and finally i give myself my
[1:14:34] give my heart to the lord
[1:14:36] it's gonna be in cruise control now
[1:14:40] no that's not what it says it may get a
[1:14:44] little worse
[1:14:47] brother brandon said i'm going to say
[1:14:48] this for the benefit of those
[1:14:50] many that it last night accepted christ
[1:14:54] and we've got young believers here new
[1:14:56] believers oh believers it doesn't matter
[1:14:57] it applies to all of us
[1:15:00] but he said don't expect the road to be
[1:15:02] a flowery bed of ease
[1:15:05] you've heard it if you've been around
[1:15:06] this message long enough you've heard
[1:15:07] that
[1:15:08] it it's going to be rough it's going to
[1:15:11] be a rugged road
[1:15:13] but it's going to be a blessed road
[1:15:15] he said because he promised he'd be with
[1:15:17] you remember it always takes the valleys
[1:15:20] to make the mountains
[1:15:22] it always takes the valleys to make the
[1:15:24] mountains it's the washing out of the
[1:15:26] earth that makes the valley and has the
[1:15:28] mountain up above it
[1:15:33] he said if you notice
[1:15:35] the children of israel when they started
[1:15:37] out and left egypt
[1:15:39] listen to what the road was
[1:15:42] he said their road was directed
[1:15:45] they followed the word of god by the
[1:15:48] letter
[1:15:50] he said following a prophet
[1:15:52] come on
[1:15:53] following an angel of god or a fire
[1:15:57] but trouble set in right away
[1:16:01] they were brought to a place that there
[1:16:02] was no place to run
[1:16:05] every time and every experience no
[1:16:07] exception it comes that way he said as
[1:16:10] they were there standing in his place in
[1:16:12] this jeopardy there was mountains on one
[1:16:14] side red sea had them cut off pharaoh's
[1:16:17] mighty marching army steadily on them he
[1:16:20] said and all of nature would scream for
[1:16:22] them
[1:16:26] he said
[1:16:29] he said god got in a panic
[1:16:32] and god got worried
[1:16:34] now you know the word better than that
[1:16:37] but he said god loves to get his
[1:16:40] children
[1:16:41] in those kind of places
[1:16:45] any of you parents ever know what it's
[1:16:46] like to be the the hero
[1:16:48] your child's in a then got their self in
[1:16:50] a tangled up mess and doing something
[1:16:52] they shouldn't do or they're that you
[1:16:54] know something's not going just right
[1:16:55] and you walk up and you get them out of
[1:16:57] it you are the hero
[1:17:00] and he said god loves to get his
[1:17:02] children in those kinds of places and
[1:17:03] i'm glad of it he said it's the greatest
[1:17:06] experience in my life when i get up
[1:17:07] against something that i can't get over
[1:17:09] around or under and i just stand still
[1:17:12] and watch god make a way through it
[1:17:16] and that's the most glorious time
[1:17:20] the most glorious
[1:17:22] place
[1:17:24] has anybody ever been there
[1:17:28] it's in those times when you think
[1:17:31] if we're not careful we begin to ask my
[1:17:33] goodness my god what have i done
[1:17:37] where where am i falling short why what
[1:17:40] what mistake did i make where's my
[1:17:41] punishment it's not punishment at all
[1:17:44] but it's god putting you in a place that
[1:17:46] you trust in him and you begin to fall
[1:17:48] back on those fruit of the spirit
[1:17:51] your peace
[1:17:55] it didn't say that they had to get all
[1:17:56] worked up
[1:17:59] what did moses do he just raised his
[1:18:01] hands
[1:18:04] peace
[1:18:06] god will see us through
[1:18:11] he said one time jesus
[1:18:13] was speaking to his disciples
[1:18:15] and he began to tell them the truth he
[1:18:17] said he really began to let the hammer
[1:18:19] down
[1:18:20] and he said you know what it did it
[1:18:21] cleaned out the church
[1:18:24] and it was 12 of them left and he said
[1:18:26] where are y'all going to go
[1:18:31] so we have to be careful and know where
[1:18:33] we stand
[1:18:37] you see sometimes people who's
[1:18:40] been made free
[1:18:42] if they're not careful
[1:18:44] they'll find themselves still living in
[1:18:46] bondage
[1:18:49] i said people that's been set free
[1:18:53] and they can be deceived into a place
[1:18:55] they find themselves back into slavery
[1:18:58] there was a story that uh
[1:19:00] d.l moody told
[1:19:02] and he told a story
[1:19:04] about a former slave woman in the south
[1:19:07] following the civil war
[1:19:09] and she was a slave woman but she was
[1:19:11] confused about her status
[1:19:15] and here's her quote
[1:19:17] she asked now is i free
[1:19:21] or been i not
[1:19:24] he said when i go down to my old master
[1:19:27] he says i ain't free
[1:19:29] he said when i go to my own people they
[1:19:32] say i is
[1:19:34] he said i don't know whether i'm free or
[1:19:36] not
[1:19:36] some people told me that abraham lincoln
[1:19:38] signed a proclamation
[1:19:40] but the master said he didn't said he
[1:19:42] didn't have any right to
[1:19:46] how many christians get confused on that
[1:19:48] same point
[1:19:51] you know that god has done something in
[1:19:53] your life you know jesus has set you
[1:19:54] free but yet you listen to the old
[1:19:56] master
[1:19:58] you go down there and you know that
[1:20:00] jesus christ wrote a a proclamation an
[1:20:04] emancipation proclamation that freed you
[1:20:06] from all bondage
[1:20:08] of satan of hell all bondage of any kind
[1:20:12] of
[1:20:13] things that satan would put upon us and
[1:20:15] he's freed you but yet you go back and
[1:20:17] you listen to that old master
[1:20:20] and we listen to that old master and we
[1:20:22] find ourselves
[1:20:23] following him and listening to him let
[1:20:26] me tell you you
[1:20:27] don't have to listen to him quit
[1:20:29] listening to him
[1:20:30] kick satan out of your minds
[1:20:33] we allow him to come in and we'll allow
[1:20:35] him to lit to start talking to us and
[1:20:37] start getting into our thoughts
[1:20:41] it's our responsibility to kick him out
[1:20:43] because he know what he's going to tell
[1:20:44] you he's going to tell you you're not a
[1:20:45] christian
[1:20:48] you're not rapture material
[1:20:51] you can't be healed
[1:20:54] you let somebody get sick what's the
[1:20:55] first thing devil says
[1:20:58] you're going to die
[1:21:02] you can't be healed you can't overcome
[1:21:04] you're not a believer you're weak
[1:21:08] and why do we listen to him
[1:21:11] why do we listen to him when there's
[1:21:12] been a proclamation made on calvary the
[1:21:15] blood was shed and said you don't have
[1:21:17] to have any of that there's no bondage
[1:21:18] for you anymore anything that i am you
[1:21:21] are through the spirit
[1:21:26] but it's what we water
[1:21:30] you know we we sow seeds
[1:21:33] and we wait for the water
[1:21:36] that's what i was doing wednesday
[1:21:38] afternoon
[1:21:40] we're trying to get grass to grow beside
[1:21:41] the road i'm trying to get clover to
[1:21:43] grow in a field i'm trying to get right
[1:21:45] to grow so we without working weeds out
[1:21:47] planting all these seeds and
[1:21:50] and i was waiting for the water we got
[1:21:52] the water
[1:21:54] but you know what that water is going to
[1:21:55] show
[1:21:57] you know what that rain's going to show
[1:21:58] it's going to show what kind of seed i
[1:22:00] put on the ground
[1:22:02] now when you take me i look at you and i
[1:22:05] look at rye they look the same to me i
[1:22:06] can't tell the difference
[1:22:09] but if i put it one over here and i put
[1:22:10] one over there and you let the water
[1:22:13] come down on it it's going to show
[1:22:14] exactly what it was
[1:22:16] back in the spring i planted buckwheat
[1:22:18] up in top of a field there's a prettiest
[1:22:20] field of buckwheat you ever seen i
[1:22:21] thought man this right here is beautiful
[1:22:23] and i wrote around the other day you
[1:22:25] know what was on the other side that i
[1:22:26] wasn't seeing about a 10 foot spot of
[1:22:29] kucklebergs
[1:22:32] where'd they come from
[1:22:34] why do we get kucklebergs in our life
[1:22:37] why do we get cuckol birds in our life
[1:22:39] and it's because of when we we go
[1:22:41] through things in life if we're not
[1:22:42] careful we don't kick those things out
[1:22:44] and as the water comes down it rains on
[1:22:46] the just and the unjust and whatever in
[1:22:49] there's where we're feeding is what's
[1:22:50] gonna grow
[1:22:56] brother brown said
[1:22:58] christians are known by the fruits of
[1:22:59] the holy spirit
[1:23:01] and listen what he says that's what
[1:23:03] dominates
[1:23:05] a christian's life
[1:23:06] and proves what he is
[1:23:09] he says then the fruit of the spirit is
[1:23:11] love joy peace faith long suffering
[1:23:13] goodness generous patience and the holy
[1:23:14] spirit those fruits manifest themselves
[1:23:18] as
[1:23:18] christians
[1:23:21] we look at galatians 5 22
[1:23:24] and now we come to the portion of the
[1:23:25] service where people can count it down
[1:23:28] because we're going to hit them all
[1:23:33] we quickly look at this and we begin to
[1:23:35] see the examples of the fruit of the
[1:23:36] spirit and what walking in the spirit
[1:23:39] produces in our life
[1:23:45] so it says by the fruit the fruit of the
[1:23:47] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:23:49] peace long suffering kindness goodness
[1:23:50] faithfulness general self-control
[1:23:52] and against such there is
[1:23:54] no
[1:23:55] law
[1:23:57] and i like that
[1:24:00] because i found out in life
[1:24:03] it's hard for me to follow the law
[1:24:09] in your christian walk it's hard for you
[1:24:11] to follow the law
[1:24:12] there were a lot of people stoned to
[1:24:14] death in the days of moses because they
[1:24:16] couldn't follow the law
[1:24:20] but in this there's no legality
[1:24:23] when you look at love
[1:24:25] i can't legally make you love something
[1:24:27] love somebody
[1:24:29] i can't tell you it's the law you have
[1:24:31] to be full of joy
[1:24:34] no
[1:24:35] i can't make you legally be
[1:24:36] long-suffering with people now i could
[1:24:38] tell you brother bother could tell you
[1:24:40] now you be careful that's your brother i
[1:24:41] know he's done you wrong but just be
[1:24:43] long-suffering i can't legally make you
[1:24:46] be long-suffering
[1:24:49] you may be long-armed
[1:24:55] so there's no law that applies to any of
[1:24:57] this
[1:24:58] legally you can't be kind
[1:25:01] but through the spirit
[1:25:03] things are different that's why paul
[1:25:05] says but the fruit of the spirit he's
[1:25:06] reminding us that in this flesh it
[1:25:08] overwhelms us
[1:25:10] this flesh that we're in and around it
[1:25:12] overwhelms us things are going on in
[1:25:14] this world it's not a good place this
[1:25:16] world for a believer to live in
[1:25:20] if you feel at home here
[1:25:22] i question your experience
[1:25:27] if you enjoy the things that are
[1:25:29] happening around us
[1:25:32] you got the wrong experience
[1:25:34] you should be making you homesick
[1:25:36] it should be making you have a desire to
[1:25:38] leave this place it should be making you
[1:25:40] have a desire to get closer to god so
[1:25:42] that you know you won't miss it
[1:25:48] nothing ever will
[1:25:50] and never can come good of this flesh
[1:25:55] but paul's telling us
[1:25:58] with all the world and the shape it's in
[1:26:01] and with all the turmoil that's going on
[1:26:03] around you all the things that you see
[1:26:05] that is not godly god is good enough
[1:26:09] god is big enough god can change the
[1:26:13] very life you're living if you'll follow
[1:26:15] the fruit of the spirit
[1:26:20] the fruit of the spirit changes our
[1:26:21] destiny
[1:26:22] the fruit of the spirit turns your
[1:26:24] darkness into light
[1:26:25] it turns your fear into faith you're
[1:26:27] hating to love your anguish into
[1:26:29] happiness
[1:26:30] who don't want that
[1:26:34] and this fruit has several important
[1:26:36] characteristics
[1:26:39] you know this fruit
[1:26:41] it isn't achieved by working
[1:26:45] no it's birthed
[1:26:49] there's a new birth that has to happen
[1:26:51] that begins to produce the fruit and as
[1:26:54] it's being produced you know what else
[1:26:55] it is it's fragile
[1:26:57] this fruit is fragile
[1:26:59] if i drop this on the ground what's it
[1:27:01] going to do
[1:27:03] it's gonna bruise it's gonna leave a bad
[1:27:05] spot in it it's gonna leave a hurt spot
[1:27:06] so the fruit is fragile we have to
[1:27:08] protect it
[1:27:10] the fruit reproduces itself
[1:27:14] whatever is on that tree is what's gonna
[1:27:16] come out when that seed goes into the
[1:27:18] ground it's going to bring itself right
[1:27:20] back up
[1:27:21] the fruit is attractive
[1:27:25] you ever seen a big
[1:27:26] bushel basket of these all polished up
[1:27:28] in a store
[1:27:30] they look real nice they're attractive
[1:27:32] to us
[1:27:33] but the fruit more importantly nourishes
[1:27:36] the fruit has nutrients in it that we
[1:27:38] can live by that makes us better and i
[1:27:40] like what paul's grammar he uses here
[1:27:43] and maybe you've never caught it this is
[1:27:44] what brought this whole message to me is
[1:27:46] when i heard paul's grammar and he says
[1:27:49] the fruit of the spirit
[1:27:53] now paul in describing the
[1:27:55] things up above
[1:27:57] he uses plural
[1:27:59] check it out
[1:28:01] when he's describing the things of the
[1:28:02] flesh he says the works
[1:28:05] with an s
[1:28:07] of the flesh that's in verse 19 if you
[1:28:08] want to find it but when he's speaking
[1:28:10] about this
[1:28:12] the fruit he's speaking singular
[1:28:15] why is that because the works the things
[1:28:18] that's going on in the in the world all
[1:28:20] the envy and the malice the hatred the
[1:28:22] fornication the the murders all these
[1:28:24] things these are works of satan
[1:28:26] these are works of satan and they come
[1:28:28] from demons now the pits of hell
[1:28:30] and these things get on people
[1:28:35] stay with me now
[1:28:37] you have one person over here that's a
[1:28:39] murderer
[1:28:41] this person over here
[1:28:42] he may be a fornicator
[1:28:44] this person over here he's a liar
[1:28:47] this person over here is full of envy
[1:28:48] this one's full of jealousy
[1:28:51] it's individuals works
[1:28:55] but when he looks at this
[1:28:57] he says singular
[1:28:59] the fruit
[1:29:00] he didn't say fruits we say that a lot
[1:29:02] don't we
[1:29:03] we all say it's the fruits
[1:29:05] of the spirit
[1:29:06] but that's not what paul said he said
[1:29:08] it's a fruit and what brought this to my
[1:29:10] attention is when my kids go to school
[1:29:12] they get an award every year they get
[1:29:14] some kind of fruit of the spirit award
[1:29:17] one year it may be joy and next year it
[1:29:19] may be love
[1:29:20] next year it may be peace
[1:29:22] meekness gentleness but they get a award
[1:29:27] for one of the fruits of the spirit and
[1:29:29] i thought that's not right
[1:29:31] that's not right at all because what
[1:29:33] paul's telling us in the big picture the
[1:29:35] spirit has one word to do and all of us
[1:29:43] these aren't individual gifts
[1:29:45] of the spirit
[1:29:48] they're not into they're not distributed
[1:29:50] to individuals like gifts
[1:29:53] this right here brothers and sisters is
[1:29:54] something for every christian
[1:29:57] both male female young old
[1:30:00] veteran christian new christian wherever
[1:30:02] you're at this right here the fruit of
[1:30:03] the spirit if you proclaim to be a
[1:30:05] christian the fruit of the spirit is for
[1:30:06] you
[1:30:07] it's all
[1:30:08] on one
[1:30:11] you probably can't see it but i've got
[1:30:12] them all written on there love yeah yeah
[1:30:14] love joy peace long suffering meekness
[1:30:17] kindness
[1:30:20] all of those make up one fruit
[1:30:26] we try to distribute it
[1:30:29] we try to say sister so-and-so man she's
[1:30:31] got love she's got a lot of love in her
[1:30:32] life she loves everybody man she i tell
[1:30:34] you what ain't nobody makes her mad
[1:30:36] she's she loves everybody she's a
[1:30:38] bleeding heart she's got all she's just
[1:30:39] love love love
[1:30:42] well she's an orange
[1:30:44] well this person over here they've got
[1:30:45] joy they're just you see them every time
[1:30:47] you sin they're just so happy they're so
[1:30:48] full of life and so so joyous they're an
[1:30:50] apple
[1:30:52] or this one's a banana you know if we
[1:30:53] place it that way we're completely wrong
[1:30:59] we're not a bunch of different fruits
[1:31:01] we're not an apple an orange a peach a
[1:31:03] pear a plum we're one fruit it's the
[1:31:05] fruit of the spirit all of those make up
[1:31:08] the spirit of god in the believer
[1:31:12] we have to all have love
[1:31:15] we have to all have peace we have to all
[1:31:18] have long suffering we all have to have
[1:31:20] gentleness and meekness and kindness
[1:31:24] you can't do it without one
[1:31:31] so rather than thinking about it as a
[1:31:33] piece of fruit uh one piece why don't we
[1:31:35] think about it as a cluster of grapes
[1:31:40] the grape hangs on the vine
[1:31:42] the cluster hangs on the vine
[1:31:44] there's a bunch of little grapes on one
[1:31:46] cluster
[1:31:47] they all make up that fruit that turns
[1:31:50] in to wine
[1:31:54] we have to have
[1:31:56] all of these
[1:31:57] the fruit of the spirit he says is love
[1:32:03] and the fruit of the spirit be in love
[1:32:05] we could say that that could be the
[1:32:07] fruit of the spirit
[1:32:09] because love encompasses all eight of
[1:32:11] the others
[1:32:12] if you think about it what is joy
[1:32:16] it's love
[1:32:18] you're loving stuff you're happy you're
[1:32:20] full of life because you've got love
[1:32:22] what is peace
[1:32:24] peace is love what is long suffering
[1:32:26] it's love
[1:32:28] so that's why love is first and love
[1:32:30] seems to be the most important
[1:32:33] brother adam says this look at this
[1:32:36] it's accepting the person christ jesus
[1:32:39] the other things will come right on in
[1:32:41] and they fit together
[1:32:43] he said let every member in this body
[1:32:45] this morning this little group of people
[1:32:47] if we can pull the curtains down
[1:32:48] alongside each one each and every person
[1:32:51] in here and each person received the
[1:32:53] person of christ jesus
[1:32:57] he said there wouldn't be a fuss
[1:33:01] or an
[1:33:02] argument
[1:33:03] amongst us
[1:33:06] he said it would just be perfect
[1:33:08] love
[1:33:10] he said yet
[1:33:12] you still believe this and believe that
[1:33:14] you you mean we can believe different
[1:33:18] around the message and still have
[1:33:20] perfect love for one another i didn't i
[1:33:21] didn't man i tell you i whoo i didn't
[1:33:23] think that was possible
[1:33:28] because there's
[1:33:29] you get around the message in this group
[1:33:30] over here
[1:33:32] they see this one
[1:33:34] way you're going to dress like this and
[1:33:37] do this and it's the length in the hair
[1:33:39] and
[1:33:39] it's all this certain way
[1:33:43] group over here may be just a little bit
[1:33:46] maybe they don't see it just quite that
[1:33:48] way
[1:33:49] does that mean we're not brothers
[1:33:52] no
[1:33:53] and that that's what he's saying here
[1:33:56] we all have to come together he says you
[1:33:58] can have perfect love and this won't
[1:34:00] believe this and this won't believe that
[1:34:04] you see how important love is over law
[1:34:08] he says but now jesus said by their
[1:34:10] fruits you shall know them and the fruit
[1:34:12] of the spirit we've done been through he
[1:34:14] said but i'm going to give you my
[1:34:16] estimation
[1:34:17] of what i think the closest thing to and
[1:34:20] evidence that a man is a christian
[1:34:22] you want to know what this is
[1:34:25] he says
[1:34:27] this is the closest thing i know of a
[1:34:29] man of the christian than anything i
[1:34:30] know of he said it's
[1:34:33] travail of soul
[1:34:38] a person that's always so hungry
[1:34:41] and thirsting for god
[1:34:44] that just simply day and night they just
[1:34:47] can't stand it they got to do something
[1:34:48] for god they're so full of love they're
[1:34:50] so full of their souls travail that
[1:34:53] they're travailing all the time
[1:34:57] so don't i'm not asking you did you
[1:34:59] legally do something this week
[1:35:02] i'm asking you did you travail this week
[1:35:05] are we in travail are we in travail for
[1:35:07] the lost are we in such a hungry and
[1:35:10] thirsty place before god that we're in
[1:35:12] sir travail the way day and night that's
[1:35:14] all we think about is what can i do for
[1:35:16] god how can i get somebody to god
[1:35:18] and you're travailing for the lost
[1:35:25] we look at
[1:35:26] love
[1:35:28] and the prophet says it's just like love
[1:35:30] he said it comes in two categories
[1:35:33] he said one of them's agape and the
[1:35:34] other is filio
[1:35:36] he said filio is earthly like friendship
[1:35:39] now there's other loves as well we've
[1:35:40] got passion you've got romance those
[1:35:42] those fall into different categories but
[1:35:44] he's categorizing the agape and filio he
[1:35:47] said affiliate love is earthly like a
[1:35:49] friendship agape love is above
[1:35:52] he said listen to this
[1:35:54] filio love is what you have for your
[1:35:56] wife and your children that's filio he
[1:35:59] said now if someone insulted your wife
[1:36:03] another place he said if a brother loved
[1:36:05] your wife
[1:36:08] he said
[1:36:09] that kind of love would make you kill
[1:36:11] him
[1:36:12] he said that man insulted your wife he
[1:36:14] said that's filial love
[1:36:17] that's not what we're looking for here
[1:36:19] watch what he says next
[1:36:22] but agape love it'll make you pray for
[1:36:25] his lost soul
[1:36:29] that's that's a
[1:36:31] that's a bunch right there
[1:36:34] because if somebody comes and they want
[1:36:35] to
[1:36:37] insult my wife my children they do
[1:36:39] something it's our natural instinct
[1:36:41] we're going to rile up and we're going
[1:36:42] to we're going to bristle up against
[1:36:44] them and we're going to be ready because
[1:36:45] we love those people with a kind of a
[1:36:47] filial love
[1:36:48] that's of this earth
[1:36:51] but god says when they do that you'll
[1:36:53] back down
[1:36:54] and you'll pray for them
[1:36:58] that's love
[1:37:05] fruit of the spirit
[1:37:07] of love
[1:37:08] did you ever notice that uh all of the
[1:37:10] things up above that paul's talking
[1:37:12] about the
[1:37:13] fornication adultery uncleanliness
[1:37:16] all those things they're uh
[1:37:19] complete knockoffs of love
[1:37:23] that's a complete opposite of love
[1:37:26] and that's where we find ourselves if
[1:37:28] we're not careful when we allow satan to
[1:37:30] come in
[1:37:32] and we get outside of the the the
[1:37:34] umbrella of the fruit of the spirit
[1:37:37] and we lose our love and joy and peace
[1:37:39] and all that we find ourselves doing
[1:37:41] those very same things if we're not
[1:37:43] careful
[1:37:46] you say well i i i'm not gonna
[1:37:50] participate in that i'm not a person
[1:37:52] full of hatred i'm not jealous and
[1:37:55] i'm not gonna commit murder
[1:37:57] what about your thoughts
[1:38:01] what about your thoughts
[1:38:03] i've found out even in my own life i'll
[1:38:06] be honest
[1:38:07] that if you ever fi if i ever find
[1:38:09] myself not as close to god
[1:38:11] one day as i was the day before my
[1:38:13] thoughts are not where they need to be
[1:38:17] and i found out in my life that a lot of
[1:38:19] times it's the people that i'm around
[1:38:20] that influence those things
[1:38:24] you know what i was saying if you sleep
[1:38:26] with dogs you're going to get
[1:38:28] fleas so young people
[1:38:31] be careful of who you're around
[1:38:33] be careful of the friendships that you
[1:38:35] embrace so close be sure that you're
[1:38:37] doing exactly what god wants you to be
[1:38:39] and you're where god wants you to be
[1:38:45] the fruit of the spirit
[1:38:47] is joy
[1:38:49] you know one of the greatest marketing
[1:38:50] strategies of satan
[1:38:54] is to make you think
[1:38:57] that the things of this world
[1:38:59] and the things of his kingdom
[1:39:01] are joyous
[1:39:05] he wants you to think
[1:39:06] that adultery is fun
[1:39:09] the fornication is fun there's nothing
[1:39:12] godly about fornication
[1:39:15] you'll never see in the bible anywhere
[1:39:16] where god said fornication's okay
[1:39:21] young people stay with me
[1:39:26] but satan has put himself into a place
[1:39:29] that he tries to convince us not only
[1:39:31] are the things of the world and the
[1:39:33] things of his kingdom fun and joyous and
[1:39:35] exciting
[1:39:37] he tries to also convince us that the
[1:39:39] things of god
[1:39:40] are boring
[1:39:43] unimportant
[1:39:46] time consuming
[1:39:54] he'll tell you no need to go to that
[1:39:55] youth camp
[1:39:57] it's boring you don't know anybody there
[1:39:59] it's no fun
[1:40:01] and he'll embed those things in your
[1:40:03] mind young people till you begin to
[1:40:04] believe it
[1:40:06] you'll talk yourself into
[1:40:08] going away from a good time in the lord
[1:40:12] now i said young people what about us
[1:40:13] older people
[1:40:17] well that service last week it wasn't no
[1:40:18] good
[1:40:20] preacher's not inspired right now
[1:40:22] now there's no need in going to church
[1:40:29] it's easy
[1:40:30] it's easy to listen to those things
[1:40:33] because he wants you to think he is the
[1:40:35] way
[1:40:36] satan's not the way
[1:40:38] only god is the way the truth and the
[1:40:40] life and it's through his joy where we
[1:40:42] find our joy
[1:40:44] but the thing about joy is is it's able
[1:40:46] to remain
[1:40:48] if you've got true godly joy
[1:40:50] it remains
[1:40:52] paul was a prisoner
[1:40:54] paul was in the shackles
[1:40:57] but paul still could sit there and say
[1:41:00] i'm a child of god i'm an apostle to the
[1:41:03] gentiles
[1:41:04] i still have joy i'm going to sing i'm
[1:41:06] going to rejoice
[1:41:09] joy
[1:41:11] suffers through
[1:41:13] no matter what the circumstance
[1:41:15] have you ever looked at those believers
[1:41:17] that's gone through some terrible
[1:41:18] horrible things
[1:41:20] in their life
[1:41:22] but yet somehow they still have joy
[1:41:27] what is that
[1:41:28] there's something on the inside
[1:41:31] that they can't produce
[1:41:33] when you go through those kinds of hard
[1:41:35] things in life that tear you down to
[1:41:37] shreds
[1:41:39] you can't produce joy that over
[1:41:42] rides that
[1:41:44] only god can produce that kind of joy
[1:41:47] the fruit of the spirit is peace
[1:41:49] i'm not talking about the kind of peace
[1:41:50] like we're not at war anymore we're in a
[1:41:52] peace town and i'm not talking about
[1:41:53] that but i'm talking about peace that
[1:41:55] passes understanding i'm talking about
[1:41:57] the kind of peace that produces a
[1:41:58] calmness and an assurance
[1:42:02] in our life
[1:42:03] that no matter where you stand and what
[1:42:05] you're going through
[1:42:08] you can stand with peace
[1:42:12] how do you get that peace you say it's
[1:42:13] the trustee
[1:42:16] the bible tells us to trust and obey if
[1:42:18] we listen
[1:42:20] and we're living and we're doing what
[1:42:21] christ tells us to do and we're obeying
[1:42:24] that you can walk in your life with
[1:42:26] peace
[1:42:31] the fruit of the spirit is
[1:42:32] long-suffering
[1:42:36] long-suffering means that you one can
[1:42:38] have love joy and peace over a period of
[1:42:40] time with people and events that annoy
[1:42:42] them
[1:42:45] i thought about that and i thought you
[1:42:47] know what
[1:42:49] i'm sure glad the pastors
[1:42:51] and preachers around the message
[1:42:53] are more long-suffering than the
[1:42:55] congregations
[1:42:59] because we wouldn't have a congregation
[1:43:00] we'd have a bunch of jailbirds
[1:43:03] we'd be in jail
[1:43:05] we are not generally as human beings
[1:43:07] we're not long-suffering if somebody
[1:43:09] don't do something we think they ought
[1:43:10] to do
[1:43:11] write them off
[1:43:14] they're not christians they don't do
[1:43:15] this they don't do that
[1:43:17] be careful
[1:43:19] christ has been long suffering what
[1:43:21] about when you first started your walk
[1:43:24] and you didn't see everything quite so
[1:43:26] clear as what you do now
[1:43:34] long suffering
[1:43:38] not not quick to judge
[1:43:42] the fruit of the spirit is kindness
[1:43:46] and goodness
[1:43:48] these two words are closely collected
[1:43:50] one of the only differences is that
[1:43:52] goodness also has generosity
[1:43:56] your goodness you're going to do things
[1:43:58] for christ your generosity you're
[1:43:59] generous you're giving you're kind to
[1:44:01] those around you
[1:44:07] you have the ability to serve god
[1:44:10] through years
[1:44:12] and years
[1:44:13] and you're faithful
[1:44:15] through these temptations
[1:44:21] the fruit of the spirit is gentleness
[1:44:24] and with this it's an idea the word
[1:44:26] gentleness here means that you've got a
[1:44:28] being that's teachable
[1:44:31] not having a superior authority
[1:44:36] i always remember the story there when
[1:44:37] brother branham talks about the man full
[1:44:40] of muscle
[1:44:41] two hundred something pound just bulging
[1:44:43] with muscles but one ounce of man in him
[1:44:47] it's not the muscles
[1:44:48] it's the spirit of christ on the inside
[1:44:50] there's where your
[1:44:52] gentleness is
[1:44:56] the fruit of the spirit is self-control
[1:44:58] this is one the world knows very little
[1:45:00] of
[1:45:01] self-control
[1:45:03] but every time they try to produce
[1:45:04] self-control is for selfish motives
[1:45:08] to make themselves better to make
[1:45:10] themselves
[1:45:11] greater or grander than what they really
[1:45:13] are
[1:45:14] but on the believer we have to have
[1:45:17] self-control
[1:45:20] and we do that on behalf of others
[1:45:22] it goes right back a little bit about
[1:45:24] what's talking about long suffering we
[1:45:25] have to have self-control that we don't
[1:45:27] lash out that we don't judge that we
[1:45:29] don't condemn
[1:45:31] we have to have self-control in our
[1:45:33] daily living with christ and ourself i
[1:45:35] have to i have to have some self-control
[1:45:37] in my life
[1:45:39] if i'm going to get any higher with god
[1:45:44] because if i didn't have self-control
[1:45:46] i'd be a hellion
[1:45:51] well i guess i'm the only one
[1:45:54] but it's the truth
[1:45:56] self-control
[1:45:59] but i like what paul says again at the
[1:46:01] end against all of these there is
[1:46:04] no law
[1:46:07] we live in the spirit let us also walk
[1:46:09] in the spirit so that we can better
[1:46:11] understand
[1:46:14] what christ is
[1:46:18] as you live in the spirit and you walk
[1:46:20] in the spirit
[1:46:22] people begin to notice
[1:46:24] things begin to change
[1:46:26] your life begins to turn around
[1:46:29] when you live a life of love
[1:46:32] and joy
[1:46:34] and peace
[1:46:35] and longsuffering
[1:46:37] you don't have near the enemies that you
[1:46:39] used to have
[1:46:40] you don't have near the anguish that you
[1:46:42] used to have
[1:46:44] you don't have near the hatred that you
[1:46:46] used to have
[1:46:49] walking in
[1:46:51] the spirit
[1:46:55] i'm going to read this in closing here
[1:46:59] brother brown said you see
[1:47:01] god is our eternal judge
[1:47:05] he says whether you have the holy spirit
[1:47:06] or not
[1:47:08] no one can judge you
[1:47:10] but god alone
[1:47:13] but we have a sign that says by their
[1:47:15] fruits you shall know them
[1:47:18] not by their church affiliation
[1:47:21] and you know we're bad about that around
[1:47:23] the message
[1:47:25] well they go to brother so-and-so is
[1:47:26] there they're not they're not they're a
[1:47:28] notch above
[1:47:31] they're pastors so and so
[1:47:35] now
[1:47:36] we're all humans
[1:47:38] we're all living by faith
[1:47:40] we're all taken one step at a time it
[1:47:43] don't matter if you're the if you're the
[1:47:45] the
[1:47:46] the biggest name preacher around the
[1:47:47] message or if you go to that church or
[1:47:49] whatever it is we're all taken one step
[1:47:53] at a time so it's not by their church
[1:47:54] affiliation but by their fruits
[1:47:57] he said nowhere in the bible does it
[1:47:59] affiliated with the church
[1:48:02] he said no the bible does it say
[1:48:04] shouting is a sign
[1:48:07] see that's where the pentecostals were
[1:48:09] at they thought shouting and the
[1:48:10] movement of the spirit they could feel
[1:48:12] it they could feel the anointing of god
[1:48:14] in the services moving amongst the
[1:48:15] people until they lost control and they
[1:48:17] just committed themselves to the spirit
[1:48:20] but that wasn't it
[1:48:22] he said nowhere does it say that nowhere
[1:48:24] does it say speaking in tongues is a
[1:48:26] sign nowhere does it say that healing
[1:48:28] the sick is a sign
[1:48:32] and we look at those things and we think
[1:48:33] man
[1:48:35] i know people around us messages that
[1:48:37] think that they can get to certain
[1:48:38] preachers and they pray over them
[1:48:39] they'll be healed
[1:48:45] now
[1:48:47] no
[1:48:52] think about that
[1:48:53] where do we put our emphasis
[1:48:56] where do we put our emphasis and think
[1:48:57] man if i could just get to brother
[1:48:59] so-and-so and have him anoint me with
[1:49:01] oil i'll be all well
[1:49:04] i'm not saying their gifts are not true
[1:49:05] they are
[1:49:07] and we know that gifts are real and
[1:49:09] gifts are distributed but it's not a
[1:49:11] sign
[1:49:12] he said the sign of the believer is the
[1:49:15] fruits of the spirit
[1:49:18] the fruit of the spirit is not seeing
[1:49:20] visions it's not healing the sick it's
[1:49:21] not speaking in tongues it's not
[1:49:22] shouting it's love joy peace long
[1:49:26] suffering goodness meekness gentleness
[1:49:28] patience
[1:49:30] and you know what he says all that is
[1:49:34] you're gonna like this
[1:49:36] all of that is the seal
[1:49:40] of
[1:49:41] god
[1:49:46] where do we put our emphasis
[1:49:49] where do we as believers put our
[1:49:50] emphasis and where should we put our
[1:49:52] emphasis
[1:49:54] the spirit
[1:49:56] of god the fruits of the spirit if
[1:49:59] you're producing the fruits of the
[1:50:00] spirits
[1:50:01] spirit it's a good sign that you've got
[1:50:03] the seal of god on your life
[1:50:07] how many wants that seal this morning
[1:50:10] how many would say god i realize that i
[1:50:12] can't just have one of these things i've
[1:50:14] got to have all nine of them i got to
[1:50:16] have all of them in my life i've got to
[1:50:18] be full of love and joy and peace it's
[1:50:20] all got to be there i can't i got to be
[1:50:23] long suffering i got to quit putting

[1:50:48] the fruit of the spirit
[1:50:50] the way i hope i could bring it out the
[1:50:52] way the lord showed it to me and not
[1:50:54] being a multi-item
[1:50:57] fruit
[1:50:58] a fruit over here fruit over there but
[1:51:00] one fruit full of all of these
[1:51:02] attributes
[1:51:04] and we've been talking about the
[1:51:05] attributes of god

[1:51:13] his savior his friend his mother his
[1:51:15] father his lover

[1:52:15] accurately show the world
[1:52:18] what a christian really is what a
[1:52:19] believer really is
[1:52:22] and we have to be able to

[1:52:30] the the products of what you are

[1:53:00] so to speak lord to make that rapture
[1:53:04] lord we see that there's a a polishing
[1:53:06] time right now where the bride is

[1:53:14] but we see things happening now at such
[1:53:16] a fast pace
[1:53:18] the lord we ought to open our eyes

[1:53:39] notification
[1:53:41] we have to be so in tune

[1:53:49] you the people here don't like you
[1:53:52] they don't like your religion

[1:53:58] and the world is against you
[1:54:00] and that was in the 50s and 60s
[1:54:04] and where are we
[1:54:06] today we're outcast of this world
[1:54:10] because we don't we don't give in
[1:54:13] to the thoughts
[1:54:14] of the world we don't give in to the to
[1:54:17] the attributes
[1:54:18] that satan has sold the people out on
[1:54:22] we don't give in to the thought that
[1:54:24] everything's got to be my way
[1:54:26] and i want to do things the way i want
[1:54:28] to do them
[1:54:30] we don't
[1:54:31] give ourselves into those thoughts
[1:54:34] and those temptations but lord i want my
[1:54:36] life to be what you have my life to be
[1:54:39] lord
[1:54:40] i want my life to line up with what paul
[1:54:43] told the galatian people
[1:54:46] that if you're gonna make it if i'm
[1:54:47] gonna have that seal
[1:54:50] i'm going to have to have these
[1:54:51] attributes of the fruit of the spirit
[1:54:55] lord work on us this week
[1:54:58] help us lord to take what was said today
[1:55:00] and if it's just one little portion if
[1:55:02] somebody needs to work on the love in
[1:55:04] their life if somebody needs to work on
[1:55:06] long suffering or somebody needs to work
[1:55:07] on joy whatever whatever it is we need
[1:55:10] to work on lord would you expose it to
[1:55:13] us and show us where we fall short
[1:55:16] will you help us lord so that we can
[1:55:19] pray about it so that we could ask for
[1:55:21] your help lord jesus
[1:55:24] because lord we just don't want to fall
[1:55:26] short
[1:55:28] we love you this morning lord
[1:55:31] we love our church our brothers and
[1:55:33] sisters this morning
[1:55:34] we lift up brother byler again lord that
[1:55:36] you would give him strength and health
[1:55:39] and lord i i pray that you would inspire
[1:55:42] him with such a fire and a and a burning
[1:55:45] zeal in the word of god that he would
[1:55:47] come out and just
[1:55:48] and as he preaches as the word goes
[1:55:50] forth it just set the church on fire
[1:55:52] lord jesus
[1:55:54] so that we could just get close to you
[1:55:56] lord jesus
[1:55:57] anoint our musicians our gifted
[1:55:59] musicians lord continue to anoint them
[1:56:02] and are so that our song service and our
[1:56:04] worship and our praise will be pleasing
[1:56:06] to your ears lord jesus
[1:56:08] [Music]
[1:56:12] anoint the brothers and sisters of the
[1:56:14] church
[1:56:15] to have a desire
[1:56:17] for each other lord jesus that we would
[1:56:19] want to see each other make it that we
[1:56:22] would pray for the lost that we would
[1:56:24] travail for those who don't know you
[1:56:26] father that we would find ourselves day
[1:56:28] and night with that thought on our mind
[1:56:30] who is not in that i can speak to
[1:56:36] lord that
[1:56:37] if we miss it we've lost everything
[1:56:39] [Music]
[1:56:40] if if loved ones around us
[1:56:42] miss it because we didn't tell
[1:56:45] we failed lord
[1:56:48] so lord give us the ambition give us the
[1:56:50] drive give us the courage
[1:56:52] [Music]
[1:56:55] to display ourselves as sons and
[1:56:57] daughters of god and the boldness
[1:57:01] when people ask that we can tell where
[1:57:02] we stand and what we believe without
[1:57:05] shame
[1:57:08] but with a boldness and a courage
[1:57:10] that would light a fire in an individual
[1:57:13] to make them want to know more about you
[1:57:16] to make them understand what really
[1:57:18] happened on calvary to let them know
[1:57:21] that the love was given freely by the
[1:57:24] shed blood on calvary
[1:57:27] and lord if there's somebody here that
[1:57:28] hadn't fully given themselves to you
[1:57:30] this morning and turned their heart over
[1:57:32] to you i pray that you
[1:57:35] reach out to them lord and tug at their
[1:57:38] heart until they can't stand it no more
[1:57:41] tug at their heart until they find
[1:57:42] themselves falling down
[1:57:45] at an altar somewhere and whether it's
[1:57:47] in their closet or in their bedroom find
[1:57:49] an altar
[1:57:51] that they can find themselves falling
[1:57:53] before your feet
[1:57:55] and ask you to be savior
[1:57:58] and lord
[1:57:59] and friend
[1:58:02] i'm thankful lord that i can call you
[1:58:04] those things
[1:58:06] but i can call you a savior
[1:58:08] [Music]

[1:58:27] there there's been times lord i'm honest
[1:58:29] there's times that i've hurt so bad i
[1:58:30] just didn't know what i was gonna do
[1:58:32] and my family's hurt so bad that we

[1:58:40] you grabbed a hold of our hand
[1:58:43] you came down to the depths
[1:58:45] of our hurt and our pain and our anguish
[1:58:50] and you reached down and you grabbed us
[1:58:53] and lord i could never tell you how much

[1:58:58] and i pray that if there's somebody here
[1:58:59] in that condition
[1:59:01] that you just reach out your arm because
[1:59:03] we know your arm's not too short it just
[1:59:05] keeps going and it reaches and reaches
[1:59:07] and reaches
[1:59:08] [Music]
[1:59:11] and help us start to grab a hold to gain
[1:59:13] that strength that we need to make it
[1:59:16] in this hour we live in
[1:59:18] [Music]
