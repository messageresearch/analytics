We're so grateful, Lord, to be amongst your children whom you have redeemed and bought by the precious blood of your own dear son, Jesus Christ. Lord, we come before you, Lord, and we want to dedicate this service, this day to you, Lord, and ask, God, that you'll speak to us in a special way. Be with Brother Joe, Father.

Sailor, God bless you, brother Josh. Amen. I just thought we'd start out this morning with a praise report. Amen. Sister Hannah, brother Joe, they wanted to say Justin, our employee, made it through open heart surgery and his home recovering. He said without the prayer cloth, he wouldn't have made it. Please keep him in your prayers as he recovers. Amen. And also the fire at the scrapard. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Amen. Also, the fire at the scrapyard was huge. It could have very quickly burnt the whole business. But God, no equipment, no buildings, and most importantly, no one was hurt. The publicity of the fire increased our customer volume 10fold. We were barely able to take care of everyone. Again, look at God. On the way to the fire, I told Joe, nothing, absolutely nothing, can happen to us without God's permission. We find great comfort in that. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Amen. Let's sing how great thou art this morning. Let's start with the chorus. And then sings my soul, my savior God to thee. Oh, how great thou art. How great thou are. Then sings my soul, my Savior, your God to thee. Oh, how great thou are. How great thou are.

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee. How great thou are. Oh, how great thou are. Then sings my soul, my savior for God to thee. How great thou are. How great thou are. And when cross shall come with shout of alamation and take me home. What joy shall fill my heart and then I shall bow in humble adoration and their proclaim. My God, how great thou art.

When life is pressing me and I have a source of power from above. I'm covered over by a shield of love. Oh, and I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calary. And those precious blood stains were made there just for me. for all my sin, my sickness, and my pain. When I need healing, those precious blood stains and I do not know how others make it through, who never go to Calary. as I do. For there's a healing cleansing which flows with peace that only his redeemed can know. So I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calary. And those precious blood stains were made there just for me. for all my sins, my sickness, and my pain. When I need healing, I claim those preious blood stains. Can we sing that first verse again? I have a source of strength when I am weak. That takes me through. When life is pressing me and I have the source of power from up above and I'm covered over by your shield of blood. Oh, and I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calary. Those precious blood stains were made there just for me. for all my sin, my sickness, and my pain. When I need healing, I claim those precious blood stains. When I need healing, I claim those preious blood stains. Amen. How many has a need this morning? Amen. You believe he's here to meet it. Amen. You may have your seats and we're going to invite the brothers for the offering. Brother Danny and brother Michael John, Brother Paul, if you'd come this time. Amen. We have no written prayer requests this morning, but just enjoying the presence of the Lord. Amen. Just come expecting to hear what brother Joe the Lord's laid on brother Joe's heart. And dad, I wonder if you'd stand up and can you pray for us this morning? Open the service. Sister Annabelle is a special this morning as she comes. Let's sing. I'm redeemed. Bought with a price. Start with the chorus. Well, I am redeemed and I've been bought with the price for Jesus has changed my whole life. If anybody asks you to just who I am, will tell them I am redeemed. Sister Jessica, if you want to come right after. Great. Sometimes I fall to my knees and pray. Come Jesus come. Let be the day. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to break but I'm holding on to a f. Come Jesus come. We've been waiting so long for the day you return to heal every hurt and rot every wrong. We need you right now. Come and turn this around. Deep down I know this world isn't home.

Come and turn this around. Deep down I know this world isn't home. Come Jesus come. Come Jesus come. Come Jesus come. I turn left when I should have gone right. I chose a winding road that led me into the night. Warning signs, flashed bridges out, and then I heard a voice say, "Stop and turn around. The turn is where I first met Christ. The turn is where I saw the light. And I left it all behind when I made the turn. And there I was made new again. That place is where it all began. And I'll never forget that day when I made the life a ride with its mountains and curves and on this road of life we slowly reap and hurt. Still today, there is hope to be found and it's found in Jesus Christ. Child, turn around. The turn is where I first met Christ. The turn is where I saw the light. And I left it all behind when I made the turn. And there I was made new again. The places where it all began. And I'll never forget that day when I made the turn. The turn is where I first met Christ. The turn is where I saw the light. And I left it all behind when I made the turn. And there I was made new again. That place is where it all began. And I'll never forget that day when I made the turn. And I'll never forget that day when I made that turn. appreciate those songs this morning. Amen. Before I turn it over to brother Brad, let's sing Mercy Rewrote my life this morning. Oh, mercy renew my life. God's mercy ruled my life. And I should have fallen, my soul cast down, but mercy reroll my life. Let's stand and sing it again. Oh God's mercy renew my life. Oh God's mercy rer my life. Oh and I should have fallen. My soul cast down but mercy rerro my life. Amen. Aren't you thankful this morning for God's mercy? &gt;&gt; What a beautiful atmosphere and and presence that we're in this morning. How many believes that whatever you have need of this morning, the Lord can meet? Amen. I certainly certainly believe that with all my heart. And and if if you're in need of healing, he's a healer. If you're in need of deliverance, he's a deliverer. If you're in need of salvation, he's a salvation giving God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. What a beautiful Lord we have. I tell you what, we're we're certainly thankful and and just to have Brother Joe, Sister Jessica, and their family with us. And you know, Brother Joe, he's he just every time he comes, he yields himself to the Lord. And I I'm fortunate enough to be able to to hang out and fellowship with him. And and I see his sincerity and his dedication and and the love and the time and the effort that he puts into seeking what God would have in store for us. He sacrifices so that we can be blessed. And every time Brother Joe comes, we just we're blessed, aren't we, church? &gt;&gt; So thankful to have Brother Joe with us. And why don't we just sing that again as we turn the service to him and let him have his liberty. How many will pull? &gt;&gt; Pull on the gift of God and see if God don't move down your aisle this morning. Hallelujah. Oh mercy, it rerode my life. Oh mercy rroad my life. Oh, I should have fallen. Appreciate that. Cast down, but mercy. Rote my life. Aren't you thankful for that mercy? &gt;&gt; Rewrote your life. If it wasn't for his mercy, where would we be this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer. Father, we humble ourselves before you today, Lord, and want to say thank you for your mercy and grace. Truly, Lord, it's nothing that we as humans bring. Lord, we bring failures and we bring our shortcomings and Lord, we bring our insecurities, Father. We bring our weaknesses, God. But Lord, we bring those things to your altar today into your presence, Lord. And we ask that you move today, Father. God, we ask that you would just draw from us, Lord, that which you have need of to manifest yourself in a greater way this morning. Father, I feel your presence here and I'm asking, Lord, that I just yield my vessel to you, my lips, my body, Lord, my thoughts, and Lord, we just give it over to you this morning that you would be the guest speaker. Lord, I ask that you'd anoint the hearts of the people, Lord, today to hear what your spirit would had to be said. Father, we love you now. We just commit this service into your care into your hands this morning. We want to be obedient servants, Lord, both listener and speaker. We ask in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, God bless you this morning. See, I got my pulling crew on the front row this morning. And we got a new recruit up here, Brother Lyric. Awesome. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We got the pulling squad on the front. So, hey, anybody, you're welcome to join us, right, boys? Amen. That's when we say amen. Amen. Well, we bring greetings to you today from our pastor, brother Tim and the saints there at Evening Light. And I'm happy to have my family with me and happy to see my my daughter Lauren and my son-in-law, Weston, and spend some time with them. It's always good to be here with you and spending time with you as well and see all your familiar faces. But today, we just want to turn to the word. And the Lord's kind of giving me a thought this morning. I want to speak to you on out of weakness. Now, I'm sure nobody in the room today has any of those. But out of weakness, and we find here in Hebrews 11 and verse 32, we're going to start there. We're going to read down through verse 40. And I hope everybody is going to be patient this morning. Nobody's in a rush. Uh but I just want to just deliver my heart the way the Lord has given us to us. But it says here, "And what shall I say more? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and Samson and Jeffa and of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms and wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, and out of weakness were made strong. They waxed valiant in in fight and turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again. And others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yay, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment. And they were stoned. They were swn aunder. They were tempted. They were slain with a sword. And they wondered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute, afflicted and tormented. And the Bible says of whom the world is not worthy of. They wondered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth. And all these and and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise. God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect. God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. I said I as I said I want to speak to you on out of weakness and we look here in this chapter of Hebrews as we recall this is the chapter of faith or the heroes of faith men and women who have done courageous things notable things so notable that we're even reading about these things again today but you know many times when we read or at least let me speak from my viewpoint when I read Hebrews 11 I think my what great men and great women. &gt;&gt; And I think to myself, and I ponder, if I would have lived back then, would I have been inscribed in Hebrews 11? Would it have been found to me to have my name placed there with Jeffa and Gideon and these great men and great women, those who were tortured and didn't accept deliverance? Would I would have received that kind of torture? Or would I have recanted the faith? &gt;&gt; Or would I have allowed myself to be stoned and swn aunder and COULD I FACED TRIALS AND MOCKINGS and scourgings? Or would I have allowed my family to be slain in front of me? or even for us to wander around in sheep skins and goat skins, no place to call home, POOR AND DESTITUTE. WOULD I HAVE BEEN THAT PERSON? &gt;&gt; Could I have made it through the difficulties that they made it through? &gt;&gt; I want to bring this home to us this morning. And we READ THIS CHAPTER AND WE THINK, MAN, THEY'VE DONE extraordinary things. How did they do it? and how could they do what they did? But if you read chapter 11, you'll find the key lays in the scripture. There is one certain trait that lays in the scripture with all humanity that we all possess. See, IT WASN'T BECAUSE THEY HAD SOME superpower and yet they did. It wasn't because they were superhuman and and possess any special gifts. Yet, they did. WE FIND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT CHARACTERS IN THE BIBLE THAT WE WE WE we fantasize over today like a Superman or a Spider-Man or Captain America. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THOSE TYPE OF SUPERNATURAL POWERS, BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MEN AND women that are just ordinary like you and I. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THEIR LIVES MAY VARY FROM OUR LIVES. THEIR STRUGGLES MAY VARY FROM OUR STRUGGLES. THEIR TRIALS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN the trials that we face. But yet THERE WAS A UNIQUE QUALITY THAT EACH OF THEM POSSESS. AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU, AND YOU POSSESS IT TODAY AS WELL. YOU SAY, "WHAT IS THAT QUALITY, BROTHER? WHAT IS THAT THAT I POSSESS THAT'LL PUT ME IN THE HEROES OF FAITH CHAPTER?" IT'S CALLED WEAKNESS. WEAKNESS IS A QUALITY THAT EACH OF YOU THIS MORNING, WHETHER YOU'RE A YOUNG MAN, A YOUNG BOY, WHETHER YOU'RE AN OLDER PERSON THIS MORNING, EACH OF US POSSESS WEAKNESS. &gt;&gt; But many of us, our human nature is to hide from it and conceal it. BUT THE BIBLE SAYS IT'S OUT of weakness &gt;&gt; were made strong. &gt;&gt; SEE, IT WAS OUT OF WEAKNESS THAT THEY BEC THAT THEY could become men and women of faith. &gt;&gt; And it's out of our weakness that we're going to be men and women of faith. You know, people today, brother Thomas, THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT they done. And man, we've done this and WE'VE DONE THAT. AND YOU KNOW, WE NEVER WANT TO EXPLOIT our weaknesses, BUT WE WANT TO EXPLOIT THE THINGS THAT WE DO OURSELVES THAT WE'RE GOOD AT, RIGHT? The things that we we ARE EXPERTS AT. OH, I CAN DO THIS. AND YOU KNOW, IF I HAD ANY kind of expertise, I'm an Excel wizard. Some of you probably like, what is Excel? Don't worry about it. But I've done it for 20SOME YEARS. I'M A MASTER OF IT. I CAN DO SO MUCH WITH IT. BUT YET THERE'S THINGS IN MY LIFE THAT I HAVE WEAKNESSES. AND IF WE'RE ALL HONEST THIS MORNING, WE EACH OF US, EACH AND EVERYONE, NO MATTER HOW GREAT WE WANT TO, YOU KNOW, IMAGINE OURSELVES, we have human weaknesses. &gt;&gt; But it was out of their weaknesses that they be become strong. Because notice, they didn't rely on their own human abilities. THEIR FAITH DID NOT RELY ON WHAT THEY COULD BRING TO GOD, BUT THEIR FAITH RELIED NOT IN THEMSELVES, NOT ON THEIR ABILITIES, BUT THEIR FAITH RELIED IN THE WORD OF GOD. AND THAT'S THE SAME PLACE THAT OUR FAITH MUST RELY TODAY. IT'S NOT ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO. IT'S NOT ANYTHING THAT WE CAN BRING. OUR FAITH RELIES RIGHT HERE, CHURCH, ON WHAT THE WORD SAYS FOR US THIS EVENING OR THIS MORNING. WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN DECLARED RIGHTEOUS. WE'VE ALREADY BEEN DECLARED PURCHASED. WE'VE ALREADY BEEN DECLARED SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. NOT BECAUSE WE MERITED IT, BUT BECAUSE HE DONE IT FOR US. IT'S A FINISHED WORK THIS MORNING. BUT THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US BY FAITH, BY FAITH, THEY DONE THESE GREAT THINGS. And let's just read about some of them. I hope you're okay this morning. &gt;&gt; Some of you looking at me like a mule of this looking through a new gate. Come on, put a smile on YOUR FACE. BUT WE LOOK HERE IN HEBREWS 11:4. BY FAITH, ABEL OFFERED UNTO GOD a more excellent sacrifice THAN CAIN. BY FAITH, ENOCH WAS TRANSLATED THAT HE SHOULDN'T SEE DEATH. BY FAITH, NOAH BEING WARNED of God of things not seen OF YET, WAS MOVED WITH FEAR AND PREPARED AN FOR THE SAVING OF HIS HOUSE, BY WHICH HE CONDEMNED THE WORLD AND became the heir OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, WHICH IS BY FAITH. And in VERSE 9, SPEAKING OF ABRAHAM, BY FAITH HE SOJOURNED IN a land of promise. VERSE 11. AND THROUGH FAITH ALSO Sarah herself received strength to conceive and WAS DELIVERED OF A CHILD WHEN SHE WAS PAST AGE BECAUSE SHE JUDGED HIM FAITHFUL WHO MADE THE PROMISE. BY FAITH ISAAC BLESSED JACOB AND ESAU CONCERNING THINGS TO COME. BY FAITH JACOB WHEN HE WAS DYING BLESSED BOTH the sons Joseph or blessed both the sons of Joseph and worshiped leaning upon his staff. Then we go down TO VERSE 24. AND BY FAITH MOSES WHEN HE WAS COME TO YEARS, speaking about young man coming to manhood, WHEN HE HAD COME TO YEARS, HE REFUSED TO BE CALLED THE son of Pharaoh's daughter. NOTICE IN VERSE 31, BY FAITH THE HARLOT RAHAB PERISHED NOT WITH THEM THAT BELIEVE not when she received the spies with peace. And it says, what more shall I say? YEAH. &gt;&gt; FOR TIME WOULD FAIL me to tell of the Ron Spencers of the world, of the Edis of the world, of the great MEN THAT HAS STOOD, GREAT SISTERS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD THAT HAS STOOD FOR THIS WORD AND STOOD. MEN LIKE GIDEON AND BARACK AND SAMSON AND JEFFA AND DAVID AND SAMUEL AND ALL THE PROPHETS WHO THROUGH FAITH SUBDUED KINGDOMS AND WROTE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND OBTAINED PROMISES AND STOPPED THE MOUTHS OF LIONS. THEY QUENCHED THE VIOLENCE OF FIRE. THEY ESCAPED THE EDGE OF THE SWORD AND OUT OF WEAKNESS THEY WERE MADE STRONG CHURCH. NOT GREAT SUPERNATURAL PEOPLE BUT EVERY DAY MEN AND WOMEN SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD YIELDING THEIR WEAKNESS TO GOD THAT HE THROUGH THEM COULD BECOME STRONG. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T WANT YOU TO SHUN YOUR WEAKNESS. He wants you to surrender it to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Each one of these carried a human weakness. Sarah, her faith wasn't always perfect. Brother Troy, she laughed at God. &gt;&gt; Jacob was a moneyhungry shyer. deceived his own brother just to get up that corporate ladder. &gt;&gt; Moses, oh, come on. Had a temper. &gt;&gt; It's okay to have a temper. Just don't let it loose. Cuz God can take that and channel it &gt;&gt; and man put YOU AS A MAD DOLL FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HE HAD A TEMPER, KILLED A MAN. and also had a speech impediment. So don't tell me you can't do something for God because you can't talk. &gt;&gt; Rahab was a harlot &gt;&gt; made a living &gt;&gt; that way. &gt;&gt; Gideon, NOTICE GIDEON, WE FIND THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US, "THOU mighty man of valor." &gt;&gt; Oh, Gideon. AND GIDEON QUESTIONED GOD AND QUESTIONED GOD AND WANTED TO BE REASSURED. YOU KNOW, LIKE SOME OF YOU OUT THERE, GOD, I NEED TO KNOW. GIVE ME A SIGN. GIVE ME A SIGN. GIVE ME A SIGN. GIVE ME A SIGN. LET THIS FLEECE DO THIS AND LET THIS FLEECE DO THAT. AND ALWAYS GOING BEFORE GOD TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOD'S PERFECT WILL. &gt;&gt; THEN WE FIND ABOUT BAYACK. BAY WAS CALLED TO LEAD AND DELIVER GOD'S PEOPLE OF ISRAEL, BUT HE HAD TO GO ON THE STRENGTH OF A WOMAN, DEBORAH. HE WASN'T GOING TO LET DEBORAH WENT WITH HIM. They weren't even husband and wife. BUT WE FIND SAMSON HAD A weakness for women. Samson gave his strength to God, but he gave his weakness over to women. See, like each of us today, they had no strengths, brother Austin, that they could rely on. were ordinary humans who possessed extraordinary faith. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; See, and it was their weakness that strengthened their faith with allow which allowed them to do great exploits. And I know you say, "Well, what about faith? What is so good about faith?" Well, I say if you were going to be executed tomorrow and they've already signed the execution agreement, WHAT WOULD FAITH DO FOR YOU? FAITH COULD SIGN YOUR PARDON. &gt;&gt; And for many of you, faith has already signed your pardon cuz you WAS GOING TO A DEVIL'S HELL AND A SINNER'S GRAVE. BUT GOD STEPPED IN AND FAITH FAITH IN WHAT HE DONE FOR YOU SIGNED YOUR PARDON. NOW YOU DON'T LONGER HAVE TO GO THAT ROUTE. And brother B WILL TELL US SO IF FEAR IS NO GOOD AT ALL NO VALUE IN IT LET'S DISREGARD IT ALL TOGETHER and let's have faith and believe God. SEE SO IS BY FAITH WE KNOW GOD NOT by knowledge. So no matter how much you know of God because you have people today, oh they know all man they know the Bible backwards and forwards quiver from quiver to quiver but yet they don't know God personally. &gt;&gt; They know of God but they don't know God. So it's not how much you know of God. It's you got to know God personally. You got to have faith. The Bible tells us in Hebrews 11:6, "Without faith it's impossible to please him." &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God, notice church, HE THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST FIRST believe that he is &gt;&gt; and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. So notice HERE THAT WORD IMPOSSIBLE MEANS IMPOTENT, POWERLESS, WEAKLY, UNABLE TO be done. So, in order to get ANYWHERE WITH GOD, YOU MUST FIRST BELIEVE GOD. AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT GOD SAID THAT HE WILL DO WHAT HE SAYS HE WILL DO. LET ME JUST SAY IT LIKE THIS. MY KIDS KNOW THAT. HEY, I MAY I got paid on Friday. How many of y'all get paid on Friday? Okay, some of y'all don't get paid, I guess, on Friday. MAYBE NOT. BUT WHEN I GET WHEN I USED TO GET PAID, NOW THIS IS JUST ANALOGY. This is a story. This may not be true. It may have some truth in it. So my kids, y'all can just kind of like, okay, dad's going one of them tangents. But you KNOW, THEY KNOW, HEY, PAYDAY IS TODAY. THEY GOT SOMETHING THEY SEEN AT WALMART OR THE DOLLAR GENERAL, TJ Maxx, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THEY WANT, HEY, WE GOT PAID TODAY. HALLELUJAH. AND AIN'T THE DADDY GOT PAID. WE GOT PAID. SEE, THEY THEY THEY THEY ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE A PART OF THE EQUATION. THEN TODAY'S A GOOD DAY. DADDY GOT PAID TODAY. SO, WE GOT PAID. THAT THING THAT I HAVE MY OWN. I CAN GO TO DADDY SAY, "DADDY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT." AND GUESS WHAT? WE'RE GOING TO TOWN TODAY. LET ME JUST SEE IF I CAN MOVE DADDY TO COME INTO TJ MAXX WITH ME. WE CAN WALK DOWN TO DADDY. WON'T THIS LOOK SO good on me? AND YOU KNOW WHAT DADDY DOES? OH, YEAH. HONEY, YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK GOOD IN THAT. AND DADDY JUST MOVED WITH COMPASSION AND HE GOES UP TO THE CHECKOUT COUNTER AND HE PAYS FOR IT. BUT CAN I TELL YOU LIKE THIS THIS MORNING? IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH GOD. WE GOT PAYDAY TODAY. OUR GOD IS SITTING ON THE THRONE TODAY, CHURCH. AND BY FAITH, WE CAN WALK UP TO THE COUNTER AND EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE NEED OF, IT'S THERE FOR THE TAKING OUT THIS MORNING. BROTHER JOE HAS A SAYING, SHAKE AND BAKE. &gt;&gt; TELL THEM SHAKE AND BAKE 33%. &gt;&gt; OR $33 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU GO TO THAT that that yard of his and say that you're going to get $33 in cash. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, CHURCH. YOU MAY LOOK, I BROUGHT A A 4 CENT CAN THE OTHER DAY, went up to his yard, ME AND BRAD. I DIDN'T HAD NOTHING IN MY HAND BUT A COKE CAN, BUT I WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE WITH A COKE CAN. I didn't know all about all the shake and bake till I left. Man, I'll turn that Coke can four cents in $33. But people know when they go to his yard, they can say that they can expect something in return. &gt;&gt; And so many times we let our human weakness get us out of conflict with God or out of ability to get something from God that we know we have need of. &gt;&gt; But see, he must be a rewarder of them that diligently seek after him. And brother Joe rewards those that come and says these phrases and mentions these things. He He's a rewarder. He's a man of his word. And if he is A HUMAN MAN, A NATURAL MAN CAN BE THAT GOOD TO OTHER MEN. WHAT ABOUT OUR HEAVENLY FATHER TO THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE NEED OF THIS MORNING? OH, HE KNOWS YOU HAVE A WEAKNESS. HE KNOWS YOU HAVE FAILURES. HE KNOWS YOU HAVE FLAWS. BUT YET, HE KNOWS HE'S PROVIDED FOR YOU IN THIS HOUR. SO, WE MUST COME AND WE MUST BELIEVE THAT GOD IS AND HE'S ABLE TO HEAL. HE'S ABLE TO SAVE. HE'S ABLE TO DELIVER. HE'S STILL ABLE TO SET FREE. HE'S ABLE TO RESTORE THIS MORNING. RESTORE BROKEN HOMES. RESTORE BROKEN MARRIAGES. RESTORE BROKEN CHURCHES. HE'S STILL A RESTORER THIS MORNING, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; I look AROUND AND I SEE WHAT GOD HAS RESTORED RIGHT HERE. YOU WANT PROOF? LOOK AROUND, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; PROOF IS HERE THIS MORNING THAT HE IS STILL ABLE. HE'S A REWARDER THIS MORNING FOR THEM THAT DILIGENTLY seek after him. &gt;&gt; And the prophet OF GOD SAID, "IF YOU CRAVE THE HOLY GHOST, that shows there's a fountain open somewhere filled with the Holy Ghost." YOUNG PERSON, HOW MANY OF YOU WANT THE HOLY Ghost this morning? THEN THAT THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A FOUNTAIN OF THE HOLY GHOST FOR YOU. HE SAID YOU COULDN'T EVEN HAVE THAT DESIRE. BUT BUT FIRST THERE CAME A CREATOR TO CREATE THAT DESIRE IN YOU. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING THOUGH YOU GOT WEAKNESSES, YOUNG MEN, BUT GOD HAS GIVEN YOU A DESIRE FOR THE HOLY GHOST. THERE'S GOT TO BE A HOLY GHOST SOMEWHERE. THERE'S GOT TO BE HEALING SOMEWHERE. THERE'S GOT TO BE DELIVERANCE SOMEWHERE. AND GOD IS OBLIGATED TO LEAD YOU TO IT. GOD IS OBLIGATED. If you got a desire this morning for deliverance, for restoration, for healing, for the Holy Ghost, God is obligated to deliver you &gt;&gt; to heal you, TO FILL YOU, TO SAVE YOU. If you have a desire, &gt;&gt; see, he said there has to be a creator to create that creation. Then there has to be something out there to respond to that creation. You know, we say it like this. Well, if God would take this from me, if God would TAKE THIS FROM ME, AND GOD WOULD TAKE, WE WANT GOD TO TAKE EVERYTHING FROM US. &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAYS, LISTEN, YOU'RE PROBABLY SAY, GOD DOESN'T PUSH YOU THROUGH A LITTLE PIPE, PULL YOU OUT THE OTHER SIDE, AND YOU SAY, "BLESS GOD, I OVERCAME." YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. GOD PUSHED YOU THROUGH. HE SAID, "BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR YOURSELF. YOU WANT GOD TO DO SOMETHING, STEP OUT ON FAITH TONIGHT OR THIS MORNING RATHER AND BELIEVE GOD THAT HE WILL REWARD YOUR FAITH. YOU TAKE A STEP, HE'LL TAKE A STEP. &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD IS UNDER OBLIGATION TO ANSWER YOU. You know, you sometimes we find that we want to put off on the ministry. &gt;&gt; Well, I came up for prayer. Nothing happened. OH, GOT QUIET. HIT A NERVE, didn't we? Well, IF BROTHER THOMAS WAS ANY KIND OF PASTOR, THEN HIS PRAYERS, LOOK, HE AIN'T A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DOES YOUR PROPHET SAY? LET ME TELL YOU WHAT YOUR PROPHET SAYS about him. See, he says now, well, he must not be a man of God or he wouldn't heard, you know, we make off like that or God would have heard his prayer. He says, "What about your faith?" SEE, IT'S YOUR faith that touches God. &gt;&gt; WELL, I THOUGHT THE MINISTRY, IT'S YOUR faith that touches God. &gt;&gt; Notice now, see, you're obeying God's WORD. AND WHEN YOU OBEY GOD'S WORD, GOD'S UNDER OBLIGATION TO answer you if you believe him. It lays in you. Well, I thought I thought you have no thought coming. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to shift your weakness into faith. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU CAN GET AWAY FROM YOUR FAILURES AND GET AWAY FROM YOUR SHORTCOMINGS AND GET AWAY FROM YOUR ALL THESE OTHER THINGS, WELL, YOU DON'T MEASURE UP. AND IF I CAN POINT YOU TO FAITH THIS MORNING, NOT FAITH IN A CHURCH, NOT FAITH IN A MAN, BUT FAITH IN A SAVIOR, FAITH IN A GOD LAMB, FAITH IN A GOD THAT'S ALREADY DONE IT FOR YOU THIS MORNING. IF YOU BELIEVE IN HEALING, THEN IT'S THE HOLY GHOST IS UNDER OBLIGATION to lead you to healing. If you want the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost IS UNDER OBLIGATION TO LEAD YOU TO THE HOLY GHOST. IF YOU WANT DELIVERANCE FROM THAT OLD DIRTY LIFESTYLE, THE HOLY GHOST IS OBLIGATED TO LEAD YOU OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; SEE, there's a power that's in the church, but it's controlled by a law, and it's the law of faith. And the Bible says, "All things are possible to them that believe." If you can believe, &gt;&gt; see, and whatever God will lead your soul to believe, &gt;&gt; whatever God I'm going to slow it down just for a little bit. Whatever God can lead your soul to believe, that's yours. WHATEVER, POPPY, WHATEVER GOD CAN LEAD YOUR SOUL TO BELIEVE. You know, WE WE STRUGGLE. WE, YOU KNOW, WE want to ask little things. And I'm I'm deviating from my notes for a minute. We want to ask little things for God because we DON'T WANT TO TAX GOD. Ask too much. Well, there was a a king OVER THERE IN SAUDI Arabia and HE WANTED TO LEARN GOLF. CARSON, he wanted to be he wanted to take some lessons. SO, HE REACHED OUT TO THIS PROFESSIONAL GOLFER IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA AND HE FLEW HIM OVER TO SAUDI ARABIA. TRUE STORY. Go ahead and put that out there. Nope. True story. Because you know when you see true story, you always want to click and watch it, don't you? SO HE HE CONTACTED HIS PROFESSIONAL GOLFER, BROTHER THOMAS, AND HE FLEW HIM ALL THE WAY TO SAUDI ARABIA, YOU KNOW, HE'S MAN, HE flew him on American Emirates or not American Emirates, but a United Emirates. Hey, plushy planes. He landed there and he was in the palace, you know, he's living it up, whining and dining. He's got the best best uh room and everything. And you know, he goes out there and he's training this king and he's showing them how to putt and he's showing them HOW TO DRIVE AND HE'S SHOWING THEM HOW TO HIT THE IRONS AND HE'S SPENDING THE WHOLE WEEK WITH HIM day in day out, 8, nine, 10 hours a day. AND WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER AND IT WAS TIME FOR THE GOLFER TO GO BACK HOME, THE KING SAYS, "WHAT CAN I DO TO REPAY YOU? YOU HAVE BEEN SO GOOD TO ME. YOU TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING YOU KNEW." HE SAYS, "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I COLLECT GOLF CLUBS." YEAH, &gt;&gt; HE WAS FASCINATED WITH GOLF CLUBS. AND YOU KNOW, AND HE SAYS, "OKAY." SO THE KING SAYS, "OKAY." AND HE FLIES THEM HOME. HE GETS BACK HOME, BROTHER BRAD. AND YOU KNOW, COUPLE WEEKS GO BY AND HE'S THINKING, "I WONDER IF THE king forgot about me." You know, THEN HE PERS, I WONDER WHAT KIND OF GOLF club he's going TO GIVE ME. WILL IT HAVE A GOLD HEAD ON IT? WILL IT HAVE DIAMONDS UP THE SHAFT? MAN, I JUST HE'S A KING. Surely he CAN AFFORD SOMETHING SO EXTRAVAGANT AS THAT. WELL, ABOUT THREE WEEKS GO BY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE CAME A CERTIFIED LETTER IN THE MAIL. HE'S LIKE, "OH, IT'S FROM SAUDI ARABIA." AND HE OPENED UP THE LETTER AND IT READ, "YOU ARE NOW THE NEW OWNER OF A 500 ACRE GOLF COURSE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN PLUSHED AND EVERYTHING BEEN MAINTAINED AND COMPLETELY FURNISHED. EVERYTHING YOU YOU HAVE NEED OF." HE WAS EXPECTING A GOLF CLUB, BUT THE KING GAVE HIM A GOLF CLUB. OH, COME ON. DID YOU HEAR ME THIS MORNING? HOW? WHY? BECAUSE KINGS THINK DIFFERENT. IT'S TIME THAT WE START THINKING LIKE A KING. &gt;&gt; LIKE WE'RE SONS OF THE KING. WE'RE DAUGHTERS OF THE KING. ASK FOR BIG THINGS FROM THE KING. &gt;&gt; HE WON THE GOLF CLUB. THAT KING GAVE HIM A GOLF CLUB. &gt;&gt; 18 hoes. &gt;&gt; COME ON, JOSH. EVEN YOU CAN SHOUT ABOUT THAT. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The deed &gt;&gt; in the mail. &gt;&gt; See, because it was by faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knew he would receive. And sometimes we know what we'd receive. But maybe we're just shortch changing God a little bit. &gt;&gt; BUT NOTICE BY FAITH. WHATEVER GOD CAN LEAD YOUR SOUL to believe, that's yours. Every place the sole of your foot shall SET UPON, BY FAITH, GOD GIVES IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; If I walked in this place this morning with a need, I promise you, I wouldn't walk out without it. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. I'm speaking to you this morning. IF I WALKED IN WITH A NEED this morning, I BELIEVE MY GOD IS SO GREAT, SO GOOD. YOU THOUGHT 2025 WAS SOMETHING? WAIT TILL GOD POURS OUT IN 26. AND MAY TAKE SOMEBODY SHOULD SAY AMEN TO THAT. BE IT UNTO ME THIS MORNING, LORD. I RECEIVE OF THE HAND OF GOD THIS MORNING. POUR IT OUT ABUNDANTLY, PRESSED DOWN AND OVERFLOWING, LORD. I WANT EVERYTHING YOU HAVE FOR ME. I WANT MY HUSBAND. I WANT MY WIFE. I WANT MY CHILDREN. I WANT MY FINANCES. I WANT MY HEALTH. I WANT IT ALL IN THIS NEW YEAR. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; See, God gives us faith. The Bible says that he's given every man a measure of faith. So it's your faith in the act that God has already did it for you. So God has already done this. And as much faith will be released, that's how much power you can have because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth. &gt;&gt; Oh, now let's just slow down for a minute. Let's rephrase that. There's enough power in you, one individual, the prophet taught us, to create another world and go live on it. &gt;&gt; Then why can't why are you struggling? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Why are you struggling? Because of weakness. Weakness to believe. Weakness because I see failures. believe it's because I don't measure up. I walked out that door coming out to this platform this morning says, "Lord, I'm so insufficient to speak this word and to preach this gospel, but it ain't based on my human abilities. And it's not based on your human abilities. It's based on what he's done for us. The act that God has done in our lives. It's faith in that and that alone." church. &gt;&gt; We think, well, deities up there floating around in the skies and my one day we we just get prayed up right and we just get ourselves, you know, we listen to enough sermons or we read our Bible for 89 hours in a day. We're going to be right where we need to be. Then we can we can approach the throne of heaven and we can petition God for what we have need of. And we make WE MAKE DEITY UP THERE IN HEAVEN. BUT THE PROPHET WOULD TELL YOU DEITY IS NOT UP IN HEAVEN. Diddy is in you this morning. HE SAID YOU THAT'S GOT THE HOLY GHOST THIS MORNING, DY LAYS RIGHT THERE IN YOU THIS MORNING. NOTICE MEN AND WOMEN, IT'S TIME THAT YOU FIND OUT WHERE YOU ARE. THE DEVIL'S JUST TRYING TO HIDE YOU BACK. TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE SOME LITTLE TROTTEN DOWN SOMETHING, BUT YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. DEITY IS NOT IN HEAVEN. DEITY IS IN YOU THIS MORNING. AND IF DEITY IS IN YOU THIS MORNING, THEN GO TO ASKING GOD FOR IT. BELIEVING GOD FOR IT. ACCEPT IT. LORD, I PERCEIVE IT THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; When you realize that Almighty God lives in you, &gt;&gt; All right, everybody, just do a little quick look. You mean Almighty God lives in this? &gt;&gt; You looked in the mirror this morning, some of you getting your hair did, and you were struggling with making your head up. You never even thought God lives in that what's in the mirror looking back at me, did you? But God lives in that. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, God lives in that. &gt;&gt; That that's looking back at you and all its weaknesses, God lives in it. Deity is not in heaven. Deity is in you. Notice he said, "So when a spirit born, spiritfilled man in faith TAKES THAT WORD INTO HIS HEART AND PLACES IT UPON HIS LIPS." WHY? THAT is the same as deity speaking. &gt;&gt; He doesn't finish the quote. Hold up. &gt;&gt; EVERY MOUNTAIN has to go AND SATAN CANNOT STAND before that man. &gt;&gt; So you JUST NEED TO REALIZE WHO YOU ARE THIS MORNING. Whether you're a young person, whether you're an older person, maybe you're not completely committed, maybe you're just here this morning just to see what's going on in the church, maybe you're, you know, maybe you're uh, you know, you're just working your way back in trying to make a decision if you want to serve God or not. I'm here to tell you, listen to it, why the same as deity speaking, when you can take that word that God has put on that Bible and make it more than just a Bible word and now becomes a living word and you speak IT THROUGH YOUR LIPS THIS MORNING, IT'S THE SAME AS DID ALMIGHTY GOD SPEAKING. THEN ANOTHER PLACE HE SAYS, I'VE NEVER SEEN THE WORD FOUND IN THE MOUTHS OF BELIEVING CHRISTIANS. OH, COME ON, SOMEBODY. WHAT ABOUT US THIS MORNING? YOU GOT A NEED AS A BELIEVING CHRISTIAN. YOU CAN TAKE THAT ETERNAL WORD AND PLACE IT ON YOUR LIPS AND IT'S THE SAME AS ALMIGHTY GOD SPEAKING IT. THE SAME ONE THAT SPOKE HEAVENS AND EARTH, THE SAME ONE THAT BLEW THE STARS OFF OF HIS HAND IS RIGHT HERE THIS MORNING WITH THOSE THAT ARE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; But all we see, Brother Thomas, is weakness. All we see is our failures. See in the church age book, brother Bam tells us like this. Don't fear, John. John is a type of the bride. Don't fear, little flock, that all that I am, you're an heir to. All my power is yours. My omnipotence is yours. As I stand in your midst, I've not come to bring you fear and failure, but love and courage and ability. Then he says, "All my power is given or all power is given unto me and it's yours to you." So you speak the word and I will perform it. &gt;&gt; Brother Austin, you got a need this morning. You speak the word &gt;&gt; and I will perform it. I want to bring it personal. I want you to look past your weakness because out of your weakness, God's going to have a testimony. &gt;&gt; I want to say something else before it escapes my mind. The greater the weakness, the greater the testimony. &gt;&gt; The greater the weakness, then the greater the testimony. because there's nothing that we declare on our own with our own human ability. So, some of you may need this next quote because I think it we all do. He says, "The weakest and the rejected and practically every hero of God ever had on the front lines was that type of person." &gt;&gt; Let me just let me read it again so it it it it charters in your brain this morning. the weakest and the rejected. And practically every hero of God that he ever had on the front lines was that type of person. So every hero in the Bible was a rejected person &gt;&gt; or dejected person or one that practically had weaknesses all in their life. A person that thought to be insufficient, a person that had no ability AT ALL, THEN THAT PERSON IS JUST IN GOOD SHAPE. SO GOD CAN START using him. &gt;&gt; Oh well, I thought I got to do this and I got to do this and I got to do this. Oh, to attain to the satisfaction of the world. If you're trying to be who's who. BUT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE WHO'S WHO. HE SAID, BUT WHEN WE'RE THINKING THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING, HE SAID, THEN GOD CAN'T USE US BECAUSE WE'RE WANTING TO DO IT IN OURSELVES. BUT WHEN YOU COME TO THE IDEA AND YOU COME TO THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER GOD, BUT IT'S GOD USING THAT WEAKNESS, GOD USING THAT FAILURE, GOD USING THAT VESSEL, IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU, IT'S ABOUT HIM. IT'S NEVER BEEN ABOUT MAN, IT'S BEEN ABOUT HIM. AND WHEN YOU CAN SUBMIT YOURSELF TO HIM AND SURRENDER THAT WEAKNESS TO HIM, THEN OUT OF THAT WEAKNESS WILL BE STRENGTH. WE'LL BE HEALING. WE'LL BE DELIVERANCE. WE'LL BE YOUR FAMILY. WE'LL BE SALVATION. WE'LL SEE PRODALS COME HOME. &gt;&gt; So we look, I know I'm kind of all over the place this morning. I'm feeling good. &gt;&gt; When you think of human weaknesses, it can depend. We can have spiritual weaknesses in our humanity, emotional weaknesses in our humanity, moral weaknesses in our humanity, and we can have physical weaknesses in our humanity. And we, you know, how many of you are aging? Nobody's aging in here but me. Mercy me and Brad. Come on, brother Glenn. None of us are getting younger. Okay, just if y'all didn't know that, ELT, I told you. BUT OUR BODIES AGE and with that comes weakness, comes inflammation, comes arthritis, comes back trouble. &gt;&gt; Micah, where you at? I know you got back trouble. You did last night anyway. And we got we we need rest and we need food and we need protection and we need healing. That's in our physical weakness. Then we look at emotional weaknesses. And I know I'm not speaking to anybody this morning, but we experience fear, anxiety. We get worked up &gt;&gt; and our minds run all night long. We lay down at 9:30 if you go to bed that early and it's 3:00 before you finally shut down. fear, anxiety, loneliness, anger complexes and grief. We struggle to stay strong through losses and stress and uncertainty. You know, we become overwhelmed with complexes and feeling insufficient and not worthy. We're not measuring up to man's idea. You know, Satan will also take it and he will make you feel unworthy because somebody else has a gift that maybe your gifts in line with. But some reason you never see what God's placed in your life, but you see everybody else's. Man, if I could sing like that sister that sang today, if I could do this, if if if See, that's Satan's word to you. &gt;&gt; You shall understand when Satan's speaking, he's going to say if because he never wants you to see what's laying inside of that human vessel. Right. &gt;&gt; But it's a it's a weakness there. And you know, it's it's a part of us that makes us been able to relation or to to have relation with others because we can see our need and we can encourage one another. Then there's a moral weakness. We we face temptation and many of US WE BATTLE PRIDE AND SELFISHNESS and impulsiveness that can lead us off course. And then there's intellectual weaknesses. And you know, you got some people got great bandwidths of intelligence. You got some of us others that don't have quite as much intelligence as others. But you know, thankfully God is not going to, you know, allow us to enter into the kingdom of God based on how much or how much we don't have. &gt;&gt; But it's intelligence. How much we know or who we know. And then there's spiritual weaknesses. See, let me just say it like this. Your human weakness spiritually isn't just a failure, church. It's the place where God's strength can come in. All right, write that down. Human weakness isn't just a failure because that's what Satan wants you to believe. It's a failure. I'm a failure. See, it's the place where God's strength becomes visible in your life. Failures. Joe, you've had some failures in your life. &gt;&gt; Look where you are now. &gt;&gt; Blessed. And if you would have let those failures keep you where you were, then you wouldn't be where you are. &gt;&gt; And if we let our failures keep us back there, then we will never measure up to where we are today. &gt;&gt; See, we're limited, but God is not limited. And we got to depend on God for strength, for wisdom, for transformation. So it's our it's human nature though to hide our weaknesses. I don't want nobody to know this about me. &gt;&gt; Hide it from others. Hide it from God. We don't want to be perceived as weak and needy. &gt;&gt; Question is answers. 1959. And I this is probably one of my foremost favorite quotes out of all the the sermons that brother Brandham ever preached because I recognize I'm a man of weakness. He says, "Oh, he loved you before there was ever a world, Josh. HE KNOWED YOUR NATURE, CARSON. HE knowed your weakness, Austin. He knowed your weaknesses." Listen what he says now. HE KNOWS YOUR HABITS. HE KNOWED ALL ABOUT YOU, WHAT YOU WAS GOING TO BE. AND THEN WHEN HE LOOKED OVER ALL THE GREAT UNIVERSE AS IT WAS, HE SAYS, "I CHOOSE YOU. ME. He chose YOU THIS MORNING. DESPITE OF YOUR FAILURES, DESPITE OF YOUR WEAKNESSES, DESPITE OF YOUR FAMILY FAMILY STRENGTH, GOD CHOSE YOU KNOWING IT WAS THERE. KNOWING YOU LACKED HUMANLY, BUT GOD SAID, "OUT OF THAT WEAKNESS, I'M GOING TO BE STRONG." &gt;&gt; God chose you in spite of it. Oh my. He chose you not because you were perfect, brother Tommy, but he chose you to be perfect. &gt;&gt; MATTHEW, WE FIND JESUS SPEAKING TO US IN MATTHEW 5 verse 48 says, "BE YOU THEREFORE PERFECT even as your father which is in heaven is perfect." Be perfect. Wow, that's a that's a lofty task. Adriana, have you made it there yet? You're like, "Brother Joe, would you please quit calling names? I'm connecting you this morning. I'm bringing you in. It's personal. Not personally between me and you, but I want to connect you to the word for this not just for me. God don't give me a thought just for Joe Adams, but he gives a thought for the people." SO HE SAYS, "BE YE THEREFORE PERFECT EVEN AS YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER IN HEAVEN or your father which is in heaven is perfect." AND HE SAYS, "NOW WHEN IT'S NOT MY PERFECTION, IT'S NOT YOUR PERFECTION. IT'S HIS PERFECTION OF HIS WORD THAT HE CHOSE US. YOU NEVER CHOSE HIM. HE BROUGHT YOU INTO CHRIST AND YOU ARE SECURED WITH JESUS CHRIST AND YOU'RE JUST AS PERFECT AS CHRIST WAS BEFORE GOD." DID YOU HEAR THAT THIS MORNING? YOU THIS MORNING, LUKE, ARE AS JUST BUT PERFECT BEFORE GOD AS JESUS IS STANDING BEFORE GOD. THAT'S SOMETHING TO CLAP ABOUT. THAT'S SOMETHING TO REJOICE ABOUT THIS MORNING. YOU DIDN'T DO IT. HE DID IT. THERE'S NO WAY FOR US HUMANLY TO BECOME PERFECT. THEREFORE, IF GOD REQUIRES PERFECTION, THEN GOD MUST PROVIDE PERFECTION. &gt;&gt; I SAY HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PERFECT. I'M WEAK. BUT ALMIGHTY GOD THROUGH HIS SLAIN SLAIN LAMB, THAT ONE THAT BLED AND DIED FOR MY MY BEHALF, IT WOULD TAKE MY WEAKNESS AND HE WILL BECOME PERFECT. &gt;&gt; PERFECT STRENGTH THROUGH PERFECT WEAKNESS. I can't be perfect. We can't be perfect in ourselves. HE SAID THERE'S NO WAY FOR US TO BE, but he declares you to be. So in the morning, look in the mirror and say, "I demand to see perfection." And if that mirror will talk to you, it'll laugh in your face. Say, "Look at you, boy. 5 foot five and a half, baldheaded, getting wrinkled. You look like a melted ice cream m cone upside down and you want perfection. I want what the word has for me. &gt;&gt; I WANT WHAT THE WORD has for me. BE YE THEREFORE PERFECT. Not perfect in body, but perfect in spirit. So we can't be perfect in ourselves. There's no way for us to be perfect. But he said for us to be. See, so what it is, he made a perpetuation for us. The Lord Jesus Christ AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. THAT'S where the perfection comes up. IGNORING OUR OWN HOLINESS OF WHICH WE have none, our own thoughts which we OUGHT NOT TO BE. BUT WE REST SOLEMNLY UPON THE FINISHED WORK OF THE LORD JESUS. GOD SENT HIM TO THE EARTH AND IT WAS IN HIM THAT WE TRUST. WE'RE NOT TRUSTING IN OUR CHURCH. WE'RE NOT TRUSTING IN OUR PASTOR. WE'RE NOT TRUSTING IN THE MINISTRY. AND THOUGH THEY'RE GREAT, WE'RE TRUSTING IN WHAT GOD HAD DONE FOR US. GOD AND GOD ALONE IS A SAVIOR, IS A HEALER, IS A DELIVERER, IS A HOLY GHOST FILLER. GOD AND GOD ALONE IS THAT. TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF A MAN. TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF YOURSELF AND PUT YOUR EYES ON THE PROMISE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; God chose you to be perfect. When the high priests would he would go in once a year, he would go in and you would you maybe you looked at something that you shouldn't have been looking at as a young Israelite boy. young Israelite girl. Maybe you thought things that you shouldn't have been thinking. And you know, it's a weakness. I can't do this in my own. This thing overtakes me. It overcomes me. I want to give it up, but I can't. It's a weakness. And once a year, you go and you find a lamb, brother Thomas, and you take that lamb to the high priest. That high priest is looking at the lamb. &gt;&gt; He's looking, brother Steve. He's looking over the lamb. He's not looking at you. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; He's not looking at what you done. &gt;&gt; Oh, look. Brother B said, he's not looking at how big your nose is, how big your EARS ARE. HE'S LOOKING AT THE LAMB. HE'S LOOKING AT YOUR SACRIFICE. AND CAN I TELL YOU THIS MORNING, THOUGH YOU MAY BE FULL OF WEAKNESSES, YOU MAY HAVE FAILURES AND FLAWS, YOUR LAMB IS PERFECT. YOUR LAMB IS PERFECT. THERE'S NO FLAW. THERE'S NO BLEMISH. THERE'S NOTHING AGAINST THE LAMB OF GOD. AND IF YOUR LAMB IS ACCEPTED, THEN YOU SAY HALLELUJAH THIS MORNING. I'M ACCEPTED BECAUSE THE LAMB'S ACCEPTED. AND OUT OF MY WEAKNESSES, I GIVE GOD A LAMB. I GIVE GOD A LAMB. HE PROVIDED A LAMB, BROTHER GLENN. &gt;&gt; And he ain't looking at me and my failures. &gt;&gt; He's looking to my sacrifice. SEE, CUZ THE BLOOD OF BULLS and goats, it could not annihilate sin. You would go in there, brother Paul, and you'd give this land. And if the high priest accepted it, you' present it and your sins would be forgiven. But as soon as you walked out and you backed out and you left, the same desires &gt;&gt; to sin, &gt;&gt; you fought them right then. &gt;&gt; Same weaknesses, &gt;&gt; you struggled with it. See, because the blood of bulls and goats could not annihilate sin. Oh, but if that sinner ever puts his hands on a perfect sacrifice, come on, church. You ever put your hands on a perfect sacrifice? YOU EVER PUT THEM ON JESUS CHRIST? YOU EVER PUT THEM ON THAT PERFECT LAMB? NOT ON SOME DENOMINATION, NOT ON WHAT SOME MAN SAID, NOT ON WHAT THIS ONE SAID, BUT YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON A TREMBLING LAMB. AND HE GOES TO CUT THAT THROAT AND HE BEGINS TO BLEED AND BLAME. AND THAT BLOOD GETS ALL OVER YOU. I SAID, "HALLELUJAH. LET THE BLOOD GET OVER ME THIS MORNING. AND MAY MY WEAKNESSES BE COVERED BY THE BLOOD OF MY LAMB. YOU'LL NEVER GO OUT SINNING ANYMORE. YOU'LL NEVER GO OUT LOOKING FOR DRUGS. YOU'LL NEVER GO OUT THIRSTING FOR A CIGARETTE. YOU'LL NEVER GO LOOKING FOR PORNOGRAPHY AGAIN. IF YOU CAN GET THAT BLOOD ON YOU THIS MORNING BECAUSE THERE WAS ONLY ONE SACRIFICE. THERE'S ONLY ONE LAMB OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT BLOOD GETS A HOLD OF YOU, BROTHER. THAT BLOOD COMES UPON YOU, BROTHER GLENN, IT TAKES EVERY DESIRE OF SIN AWAY. &gt;&gt; IT'LL ANNIHILATE SIN. IT'LL ANNIHILATE SIN NATURE. How can I be perfect by a perfect sacrifice? By a perfect sacrifice. Hebrews 9:22 says, "Without the shedding of blood," oh, we don't want a we don't want a bloody religion, but without the shedding of blood, there is no remission. Something has to die in your place. Someone has to die in yourstead. &gt;&gt; And there's only one worthy. &gt;&gt; By one sacrifice, &gt;&gt; by one sacrifice, we don't have to go year after year, special meetings to get ATONE FOR CHURCH. ONE TIME, YOU REALLY MEAN BUSINESS WITH GOD. YOU TRULY REPENT AND YOU TAKE ON THAT NAME AND HE'S OBLIGATED TO FILL YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST. NO LONGER DESIRING SIN, COVERED YOUR WEAKNESSES, COVERED YOUR FAILURES, COVERED YOUR FLAWS. ONE SACRIFICE, ONE TIME. IT AIN'T OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. GOD MADE A TOTAL SACRIFICE. GOD MADE A TOTAL COMMITMENT TO THE BELIEVER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP COMING TO THE ALTAR AND COMING TO THE ALTAR AND COMING TO THE ALTAR. BUT YOU MEAN BUSINESS WITH GOD. GOD, I'M GOING TO SURRENDER MY WEAKNESS TO THIS ALTAR. TAKE IT OUT OF ME THIS MORNING. TAKE THE SIN OUT OF ME. TAKE THE DESIRE OUT OF ME. TAKE THE DRINKING OUT OF ME. TAKE THE WOMANIZING OUT OF ME. TAKE THAT LIFE DESIRE OUT OF ME, LORD. &gt;&gt; AND LET ME LIVE a godly life. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, no preacher is going to do it for you. &gt;&gt; Not even the prophet. He was just a man. &gt;&gt; But he's not looking, brother Thomas, he's not looking at us. &gt;&gt; He's looking at our sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And if your sacrifice is perfect, then you're perfect. Then you he'll accept you. See, weaknesses is not just a flaw. It's what makes us grow. Can I keep going a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; All right, good deal. I'm glad you said amen to that. I was going to disappoint you if you didn't. See, weaknesses creates humility. All right, come on, Cherabs. Sit on your wings for a few more minutes. It teaches dependence not on one another but on him. It fosters compassion because you see weaknesses in your own life. You can have compassion for others. &gt;&gt; I know that we some of us struggle with that one. I raise my hand. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm like, man, would you just pull up your pants and deal with it? Come on. Sometimes I lose compassion, Brother Troy. I'm like, you've been doing this over and over and over and over and over, and you just want to slap him for Jesus. Say, get a hold of yourself. But God reminds you of your own weaknesses &gt;&gt; so you can have compassion for others. &gt;&gt; Now, we may struggle, brother Gle, in different areas. I don't know what an old man struggles with. WELL, PRAISE GOD. I AIN'T STRUGGLING THERE. YEAH. I love it. Well, see, when we get the Holy Ghost, how many of you got the Holy Ghost this morning? All right, that's a good show of hands. Well, when I got the Holy Ghost, I THOUGHT, "WOO, PRAISE GOD. IT'S OVER. THIS IS GOING TO BE SMOOTH SAILING. WATCH OUT, DEVIL." WAS I WRONG? &gt;&gt; I GOT THE HOLY GHOST AND THE BATTLE INTENSIFIED. &gt;&gt; SO, we think WE GET THE HOLY GHOST AND ALL THE WEAKNESSES THAT WE DEALT WITH, THEY'RE GOING TO BE OVER. NO, YOUR SOUL IS REDEEMED. But this little device right here struggles. &gt;&gt; SO MUCH SO THAT THE FIRST CHURCH AGE MESSENGER Paul said, "The things that I would do, I do not. And the things that I do not, I do." &gt;&gt; PAUL UNDERSTOOD THE WAR IN HUMANITY. He understood the war with weakness. &gt;&gt; So just because you have the Holy Ghost doesn't mean it alleviates all the human weaknesses. &gt;&gt; No. But the Holy Ghost will give you power &gt;&gt; to control to put that weakness under obedience to the word of God. &gt;&gt; All right. I hope this is okay this morning. See, human weaknesses is a result of the fall. So we all when we get to the other side, we're going to have a conversation with Eve and say, "What in the world were you thinking? Did you not realize what you did to us?" No, she had a weakness. See, weakness is a result of the fall. It's contribute to sin nature. Before that, man lived in an in a a dimension of eternity. There was no sin. There was no sin nature. We were blameless. We were in THE IMAGE OF GOD. BUT AFTER THE FALL, man entered into an element of time. And then their time began to have an effect on the body, had an effect on the mind, had an effect on our life. And no longer did we have a God nature. Now we had a sin nature that we were dealing with. And so as a result of the fall, sickness is a result, complexes are a result, anxiety is a result, depression is a result, lying and cheating, AND THESE ARE ALL RESULTS OF THE FALL. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW, MAN WAS NOT CREATED TO LIVE IN A state of weakness. &gt;&gt; God said, "Let us create man in our image." And God was not weak. See, God created us to be amateur gods. to be perfect in all aspects of humanity. He never intended you to rely on your humanity and your good deeds and your intellect and all all these other great things that you can offer God to get you back to heaven. No, God knew that it would take more than your human abilities to make a way for you to enter into his presence. See, we were all born in sin, shaped in iniquity. We come to the world speaking lies. Therefore, we needed a lamb. And not just a lamb. We needed a perfect lamb. &gt;&gt; So I ask you this morning, human weaknesses are a result of sin nature controlling humanity. So do we make excuses for who we are? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to hold you much longer, y'all. Just revive yourself for a minute. Then we MAKE IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW the human nature is to make excuses. Well, I family, my dad or my mom or it's a, you know, it's a genetic curse. It's a hereditary, it's a strain, it's always been in my family. Shall we continue in sin? Paul would tell us that grace may abound. God forbid. Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, quit making excuses for your shortcomings. &gt;&gt; God has provided you something better. &gt;&gt; He provided you an antidote to keep you, to change your desires, &gt;&gt; change your humanity. You know, we're going to deal with weaknesses. But the Bible would tell us, Paul says in Hebrews 11, "Wherefore, seeing that we're we're compassed about with SUCH A GREAT CLOUD of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, &gt;&gt; every incumbrance, everything, every sin which so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us." And we MUST FIGHT IF WE MUST REIGN. Things are not going to come easy, church. You got to be willing to make decisions. &gt;&gt; Not pamper, not coddle. Oh, my my little excuse and my little weakness and I'm not good enough and oh, nobody likes me and oh my goodness, gag a maggot. &gt;&gt; I mean, for real. Codle, codle, codle, cuddle, cuddle. Man up, WEAK SAUCE. &gt;&gt; GOD CALLED YOU TO BE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD, NOT CODDLE YOUR EXCUSES. NOT CUDDLE YOUR FAMILY STRENGTH, NOT CUDDLE that weakness, but to lay that thing down at the foot of the cross. &gt;&gt; Every man that ever amounted anything in the Bible was a man that was weak and rejected. &gt;&gt; But they were exactly in the place for God to use them. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Isn't that beautiful? Ain't that just beautiful to realize every man, and we say man, we include you sisters. Man, as in mankind, &gt;&gt; every man that ever amounted anything in the Bible, was weak &gt;&gt; and rejected and dejected. and they were right in the place for God to use them &gt;&gt; to be a hero of the faith because we're not relying on our own abilities. &gt;&gt; Look, if we were relying on height, y'all look at me. I mean, come on. Stubby B. WE GOT GIANTS in the room today. Not giants, not Anakins. I ain't going there. &gt;&gt; We got some very tall individuals. And I just wish I had one more inch of their height. But if we were going by height, man, the Ler family got us all whooped. We were going by looks, well, we ain't going to go there. We'll just pass that one on along. &gt;&gt; So, WE'RE NOT GOING ON ANY HUMAN ABILITY BECAUSE IF WE DO, WE LOOK, WE START LOOKING AROUND. AND NOTICE, WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT WHAT THEY POSSESS. WE LOOK AT WHAT we don't possess &gt;&gt; because that's human nature to see what we lack. &gt;&gt; Where am I short? Where? And don't y'all look at me when I say short. &gt;&gt; Where am I weak? &gt;&gt; See, that's what Satan wants you. Just constantly bombard you with your own inabilities. But if you can ever, ever, ever, if God ever takes your eye off of you &gt;&gt; and takes your eye off your brother and takes your eye off your sister and put your eyes back on what he's done for you, &gt;&gt; you can see that everybody in the word who's ever amounted to anything was just like you. Just like you. But he says, brother Bam tells us, I'm going to go just a little bit further. I won't hold you much longer. We try to make our weaknesses excuses. We want to tell how big we are. Let me just I'm going to go ahead and be honest, be transparent. I drive a big truck. Y'all can laugh. Yeah, I'm compensating. I'm a little dude, but I drive a big truck. I had to jump up, Carson, to get in it. Thank God it's got electric uh side panels or whatever you want to call it. Running boards. Yeah, I need them. Run and jump on the board. Jump in the seat. Cuz look, short people. Y'all ain't short. You don't know what I'm talking about. But we try to make we try to overcompensate guilty for our excuses. Well, I'm this. You find people that they don't talk. Maybe they overcompensate because they got so much in their brain going on that they just don't know how to say it all, put it all together. Or we, you know, we we just try to they overcompensate, try to make their yourself look bigger than what they are. And it's a complex. Listen what he says now. We want to tell how big we are, how great we are. He says that's think he said that's what God gave me the text for. And he was preaching on perfect strength by perfect weakness. He says there's little things that we do and that we must come to church if we, you know, it's to find OUT WHAT OUR FAULTS IS AND things of that that we might better ourselves. If we come to church, church, if we come with any objective, then I'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church. See, we must come to find out our weaknesses. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we come to church and we come with any other desire than to find out where we're weak, where we're short, then he says, I'm afraid we won't get much out of coming to church. But we must put our trust in somebody that's strong. And that somebody is not your pastor. &gt;&gt; That somebody's not the ministry. That somebody's not your brother and sister. That somebody is Christ. So he chose us. Brother says he chose us because we're in that condition. Oh my. It is, isn't it? He chose you. I told you boys I wasn't going to call you out, but I got a prime spot right here. Look at Daniel's trying to not look at me. He's like, but see, Gideon is not Daniel and Daniel is not Paul and Paul is not lyric. And yet they're all related. They share the same blood, share a lot of similar spirits, but they all have different weaknesses, different things that makes lyrics. He ticks a little bit different than Paul ticks. Paul won't talk. Daniel's getting there. And Gideon won't be quiet. Gideon can walk into a crowd and man, he don't care. He don't recognize his weaknesses because he don't have any. Not to himself, but we we look and we we see our shortcomings and we see our failures and we see where we miss it all the time. But if we can ever get our attention off of ourselves and see what God has placed in us, that God chose you in that condition. Paul, he chose you just like you are. Don't change. &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe talk a little bit more than what you do, but that's okay. And Lyric, you too. Lyric tries to walk around being all bowed up. little Tommy Jr. and he's a bowed up little fella. We was hitting weights the other day. He's surprised that a 50-y old man can pump it out like I do. I'm like, "Yeah, bro. This ain't no weak sauce. I'm Louisiana. I'm cinjun strong." &gt;&gt; But we're all God chose us exactly the way we are &gt;&gt; and exactly with the weaknesses that lay in us. And out of those weaknesses, we become a powerful force to be reckoned with. &gt;&gt; When we realize it ain't about me, it ain't about you, but it's about him. &gt;&gt; And if I was going to be in Hebrews 11, what would be written of me in my weakness and mine differs in yours? and yours differs than your neighbors, but from or out of weakness, will it be said that I was strong? Paul had an infirmity with his eyes and he begged God, pleaded with God, take this thing from me. Caleb asked him, please just get it out of me. I just I want to be an apostle. I want to be an evangelist. I want to be a great preacher. God, DID YOU CALL ME? BUT I can't even see the parchment in front of me. I'm weak. God didn't make an excuse for Paul's weakness. Paul didn't make up some Saabb story or God didn't make up some Saabb story. He simply told Paul that my strength, my strength, not your strength, not your church's strength, not the prophet's strength, but my strength is made perfect in your weakness. And if you can can surrender to me your weakness, Paul, I will use you like never before. Paul asked for this thing to be removed. Many times we asked to be taken out of that trial, taken out of that situation, to have that weakness covered. And if God can speak to you this morning, my strength is made perfect in your weakness. And Paul said, "If I glory, I'm going to glory in my infirmities. For when I am weak, then I am strong." &gt;&gt; Recognize, church, when I am weak, then I am strong. Not because you can bench press 275. Not because you can curl 80 pound dumbbells a 100 times. It's not that kind of strength. Because when you recognize your weakness, then you must recognize your dependency comes upon him. &gt;&gt; And in my weakness, I'm strong. Not because of my human abilities, but because of him. &gt;&gt; Because his grace is sufficient. And if God has called you, God chose you in your weakness to be a part of the body of Christ. And we each differ one from the other. Romans 12:1, musicians, you can make your way back. Romans 12 when Paul says this, "I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." God doesn't want your excuse. God wants your weakness. Did you hear me? God doesn't want your excuse. Gersham, you're about to be married. Your responsibility taking on a wife and to lead and to guide and to take her further in the word to be a spiritual head. And yet you have weaknesses. But God don't want your excuse. He wants that weakness. See, don't make an excuse for who you are, how you are. Surrender it to him. &gt;&gt; You surrender that thing to him. &gt;&gt; He told Paul, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Therefore, I take pleasure in my infirmities." It's hard to admit that you're weak and you have frailties and to own it, but it's part of being human. But don't make an excuse for it. No, you bring it and you surrender it. You surrender to him. Surrender to the cross. I'll take pleasure in my infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions and in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong. Let me bring this to a close. Think about it for a minute. The maniac of Gadra, that man had a weakness. Sin slipped in. One spirit after another spirit after another spirit after another spirit. And he find him out in the tombs. And he was so strong. He can break chain. He was five times his strength because he surrendered his weaknesses to the devil. And brother Bam said, "If a man can be five times stronger than what he was because he surrendered to the devil, what about man when he surrenders to God? Where would we be this morning instead of making excuses for where we come from, our family we're in, our shortcomings we have? And so God doesn't want your excuse. He wants your weakness. He knows what they are and he chose you despite them. He doesn't expect you to run from them. He wants you to surrender this morning with every head bowed and every eye closed. I'm going to invite you this morning by the grace of God. You recognize in this new year, you got things you're battling that you've not got the victory over yet. He doesn't expect you to surrender those things to the world or to cuddle them anymore, but he wants you to make a complete surrender this morning. Surrender every fear. Surrender every complex, every unworthy thought, every regret, every stronghold, every battle in the mind, every physical weakness, every financial weakness, every doubt, every negative thought this morning. Every complaint, make a complete surrender, church. See, God cannot use one ounce of our abilities, but he can use your surrender. This morning, I'm going to invite you to the altar. Starting a new year, none of us are perfect. God bless you. God sees you this morning. Whe there be another said this new year, I'm recognized and I'm coming face to face with reality this morning. I'm not perfect. I have struggles. I have weaknesses in my humanity. But I'm going to surrender. I'm going to make a complete surrender this morning. &gt;&gt; And out of my weakness, out of my difficulties, out of my struggles, I want God to have a testimony. I want God to use me like never before. I want to surrender all that I am that he can get the glory. And he says when you can get to that place and you can recognize your weakness, then God can use you this morning. Father, you see every everyone that's here, Lord. God, you see our struggles, Lord. You see where we come short, Father. Lord, the battles that we face, one different from another, Lord, the the mind battles, the struggles, Lord, humanity, Father, and generational curses and family strains and Lord, things that we battle with in the world, the pressures of this life, Lord, Lord, we come and we lay them at the cross this morning. We lay them at your feet, Father, not to make an excuse, not to hold them over, Lord, in 2026, Father, but we surrender them to you and make a complete surrender this morning, Lord. And out of weakness, we'll be a stronger Christian, be a stronger family, be a stronger church, Lord, out of our weaknesses, Father. Lord, there's there's young men and older men, young women and older women. Lord, Lord, there's all of us through all walks of life. We're here this morning, Lord, recognizing &gt;&gt; our weaknesses, but Lord, we recognize your greatness and greater the weakness, then greater the testimony. So, we commit each and everyone to you this morning, Lord, the service. Now I ask you to bless my brothers and my sisters, Lord. Bless the church, Brother Thomas, Lord, as he continues to labor, Father, planting and planting and planting and nurturing, Lord. Brother Brad, as he would come behind, Brother Thomas, and water and water and water, Father, different ones you have placed here, Lord, to be an association here, Father. the musicians and the you know those on the back with the program and the sound and the the overhead Lord all these other aspects and even us Lord sitting right there in the pew. Father may you strengthen us today by thy word and by thy spirit we pray in Jesus name. Amen. in the presence of Jehovah, God Almighty, Prince of Peace. Trles vanish, hearts are mened in the presence of the king. In and out of situations that tug a war in me. All day long I struggle for the answers that I need. Then I come into his presence. And all my questions become clear. And for that sacred moment, no doubt can interfere in the presence of Jehovah. God Almighty, prince of peace, trles vent, and hearts are mened in the prison. of the king. And through his love, the Lord provided a place for us to rest. A place to find the answers in the hour of distress. Now there's never any reason for you to give up in despair. Just slip away and breathe his name. He will surely meet you there in the presence of Jehovah. God Almighty, the prince of peace. Troubles vanished and hearts are mened in the presence. Oh, of the king. In the presence of Jehovah. Oh, in the presence of Jehovah, God Almighty, prince of peace, trles vended, And hearts are mened in the presence of the king. And it is no secret what God can do. What he's done for others, he'll do for you. And with arms wide open, he'll parten you. It is no secret what God can do. Oh, it is no secret what God can do. What he's done for others, he'll do for you. before you with arms wide open. He'll pardon you. It is no secret what God can do. Flow through me, Holy Spirit. Flow through me. Flow through me.

Holy Spirit flow through me. Overflow through me. Holy Spirit flow through me as I lift my hands in worship and to magnify thy name. Flow through me, Holy Spirit. Lord through me. Amen. Can we sing He's in the house. He's in the house this morning. A little girl was lying there. The people all were weeping. They just laughed at Jesus said, "She's only sleeping." But as he took her by the hand, she began to live again. Some began to praise the Lord. And some began to say, "He's in the house, and death has to flee down this morning." Oh, now there is life where darkness used to be. And now there is hope and there's no more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his name. He's in the house. I was like that little girl dead in all my sin till Jesus touched this heart of mine and gave me life again. I am just a house of clay. Ever since that blessed day, there's a light that shines on me for all the world to see. He's in the house and death has to flee. And now there is life where darkness used to be. And now there is hope and there's no more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his name for he's in the house. Oh, and death has to flee. Now there is life where darkness used to be. And now there is hope and there's no more doubt. Well, praise his name. Praise his name for he's in the house and he's the name above all names and he is worthy of our praise. Oh, and my heart will sing, how great is our God. Oh, for he's the name above all names. Oh, he is worthy of our praise. And my heart will sing. How great is our God. Oh yes. How great is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great is our God? And all will see how great, how great is our God. How great, oh yes, how great is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great is our God and all will see how how great. Let's bow our heads this morning. precious, kind, heavenly father, as we've once again experienced, Lord, your presence with us again today, Lord, in a special way. Father, we know that's you, Lord. We see you, Father, in your servant when the word comes forth, Lord Jesus. We see you in the praise of your people, Lord. We see Lord Jesus you in the response of the people Lord when they give their hearts and their weaknesses to you and come to the altar Lord and give you their weaknesses and we know that's not in vain. We know that you see that and you honor that Lord and Father I'm expecting to hear testimonies. I'm expecting Lord Jesus to you for you to take all those who have Lord surrendered their weaknesses today Father and message that you've laid upon brother Joe's heart that's minister to us. We know that it wasn't his message. It was your message to us this morning. And Father, we ask God that you'd help us, Lord, to be able to surrender all of our weaknesses, Lord, so that you can turn them into strength, mighty strength, Lord Jesus, and do great things, Father, even as you did with the Apostle Paul, Lord. Father, we thank you, Lord, that we can tar, Lord, for those, Lord, who are seeking to touch the hem of your garment, Lord Jesus. just needing a touch from you this morning, Lord Jesus. As ministers can't do it, but we can show them the way and show them, point them in the direction, and that is to you. And Father, and we're so grateful, Lord Jesus, this morning for having been around one another, Lord Jesus, your children, Lord, and your presence in their house of God. We thank you, Lord, for what you've spoken to us today. And we would ask Lord Jesus that we wouldn't go out those doors worse but better than what we did when we came in Lord. And we believe that we will. Father, we thank you for this beautiful, beautiful service that you've given us, the wonderful words that you have spoken to us, Lord, about the perfect sacrifice. And we love you, Lord. We just want to tell you that we love you with all of our heart. Thank you for promising that you would never leave us nor forsaken but you that would be with us even in us to the end of the world Lord and we are right at that place now Father keep each one Father we ask in Jesus name as we go our separate ways Lord we would ask Lord that you'd help each one to walk in that sweetness Father Lord may they not have to be awake from 9 to 3 in the morning and tormented Lord but may they have peace in their hearts and in their minds Lord Jesus, their conscience being pure before you, Lord Jesus, walking with you, enjoying your presence daily, Lord. If there's any that hasn't got it in that way, Lord, and don't know you in that way, Lord, may they not leave till they know you in that way. Father, the peace that passes all understanding, God, we ask these blessings and favors in Jesus' name. How many has enjoyed the service? Amen. Let's thank God one more time. God bless you, Ian.

Hope of earth and joy of heaven. Precious day. Oh, how sweet of earth and joy of heaven.
