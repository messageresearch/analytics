[15:31] If we just all stand this morning,
[15:36] maybe uh brother Caleb will open us in
[15:38] prayer this morning.
[15:58] Amen. The children can be dismissed to
[15:59] Sunday school. And if you'll go in with
[16:02] with me in the Psalms,
[16:05] we're going to Psalms 130. We're going
[16:08] to read Psalms 130 and 131.
[16:13] What a privilege to be in the house of
[16:15] the Lord again this morning. It's such a
[16:17] beautiful day outside.
[16:20] Psalms 130.
[16:24] Out of the depths have I cried unto
[16:25] thee, O Lord.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; If thou Lord shouldest mark iniquities,
[16:35] O Lord, who shall stand?
[16:43] I wait for the Lord. My soul doth wait.
[16:46] And in his words do I hope.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; Let Israel hope in the Lord. For with
[16:59] the Lord there is mercy and with him is
[17:01] plenteous redemption.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, my heart is not nor my eyes lofty.
[17:11] Neither do I exercise myself in great
[17:13] matters or in the things that too high
[17:15] for me.
[17:26] This one together. Let Israel hope in
[17:28] the Lord from henceforth and forever
[17:30] more. God bless you. You may be seated,
[17:32] Brother Brian.
[17:36] Morning,
[17:47] brothers and sisters.
[17:49] Hope you've all had a good week. God has
[17:52] blessed you.
[17:55] You know, I was thinking about that
[17:57] psalm we were reading.
[17:59] You know, you know, David was a king.
[18:02] You know, all the world, you looked up
[18:04] to him as a king. But when he writes
[18:06] these psalms, he writes them as a common
[18:08] man that sees himself no greater than
[18:11] the man next to him. All he is is a
[18:13] servant of the Lord or a servant of
[18:15] Jesus Christ. If you would turn with me
[18:18] uh to Isaiah the 55 55th chapter,
[18:23] you know, I was
[18:26] thought came on me over there. You know,
[18:30] thing about a Christian life, I was just
[18:32] thinking
[18:34] it's a sealed life. A Christian life,
[18:36] you're sealed from the things of this
[18:38] world, from the cares of this life.
[18:41] Doesn't mean that you don't live out
[18:42] there on that and you have to provide
[18:44] for yourself, but you're sealed from the
[18:46] evil things of this world. You're
[18:48] completely sealed from anything that
[18:51] would hinder your walk before Jesus
[18:53] Christ this morning. And and I was just
[18:55] thinking, you know, you all know what I
[18:57] do for a living. It's no different than
[18:59] what I do. You know, a refrigeration
[19:01] system is a sealed system. It's totally
[19:04] sealed off from the atmosphere. And if
[19:06] it ever starts leaking, what happens to
[19:09] it? It fails. It's going to fail if it's
[19:11] leaking. And it's no different in a
[19:13] Christian life. If you're leaking out
[19:16] into the things of this world, you're
[19:18] not going to be successful. The only way
[19:20] that you're going to be successful is
[19:22] you're totally sealed into Jesus Christ
[19:25] this morning. It's not me doing it, but
[19:27] it's Christ doing it through me. Nothing
[19:30] of myself, all looking to him. And and I
[19:34] was before I get started, um what I'm
[19:38] not saying we're a government, but
[19:40] really our year starts every September
[19:42] as a church financially.
[19:45] So, we're we got several expenses to go
[19:49] into the next year as I look um in
[19:52] September. I've said this before,
[19:55] next week. I'm surprised I was expecting
[19:58] to get it this week, but probably get it
[20:01] the coming week before 1st of September.
[20:04] I'll get the annual insurance for the
[20:06] church, the liability and the building
[20:09] insurance. And then also I do the
[20:12] prefill for the propane for the coming
[20:15] winter. But I know it seems like winter
[20:17] is so far away, but from a cost
[20:20] perspective for the church, it's just uh
[20:24] it's just next door. Um they've already
[20:27] done the summer fill and it wasn't too
[20:29] expensive. It's $300 or $400. So I
[20:33] didn't get a sheet from southern states.
[20:35] I don't know if they're even doing
[20:36] winter fill. So sometime that this
[20:39] coming week, I'll go by southern states
[20:41] and see if they're doing summer fill and
[20:43] try to get in uh a lock rate for I
[20:47] usually do a,000 to,500 gallons and then
[20:50] we start paying after that in the year.
[20:52] Uh the insurance last year for the
[20:54] church
[20:56] um was $3,900.
[20:59] Uh that's for everything. That's
[21:01] including liability for That's including
[21:05] liability insurance. Also, it's like
[21:08] I've always told you before, if you ever
[21:09] got any questions, I know I say that a
[21:12] lot. Uh don't be afraid to ask me how,
[21:16] you know, what goes on
[21:18] and some of you already know that I was
[21:21] supposed to be retired, but it seems
[21:24] like I haven't been retired the last
[21:26] eight or nine weeks. I'm working just as
[21:28] much as I did last summer. As you some
[21:31] of you know, I haven't been going to the
[21:33] bank as much as I should have. So, I'm
[21:35] going to make sure I get everything done
[21:37] to finish this month before it ends when
[21:39] it when it comes to what I have to
[21:41] deposit also.
[21:45] But I was I was thinking this morning,
[21:48] I'll just
[21:50] I had some ideas, but then I just turned
[21:54] blank here. So, I'll just read God's
[21:56] word and let it speak to us in our
[21:58] hearts this morning. You know, the
[22:02] it really as I get older, I know one
[22:04] thing. As some of you seen up there, I'm
[22:07] a year older this morning. As I get
[22:09] older, I realize how much as a younger
[22:12] man, I really depended on myself and not
[22:15] on the Lord in the things that I did.
[22:17] And as I get older, I real I can see
[22:20] back in my old life that I really didn't
[22:23] trust him as much as I really should
[22:25] have trust him. I was trusting myself
[22:27] more than I was trusting him. And I
[22:30] realize now, I can confess in my own
[22:32] heart that as I get older, I realize
[22:37] it's I'm totally depending on him to be
[22:39] successful in anything I do anymore. But
[22:43] the most important thing is I'm totally
[22:45] dependent on his love and grace for the
[22:47] salvation of my soul. And it's nothing I
[22:50] deserve but a gift that he gives me. So
[22:53] when I look, you know, I when you look
[22:55] at the circumstances in the life in this
[22:58] world, you you you
[23:01] just have to have grace and love for
[23:02] people. You just you're hoping the best.
[23:04] You're praying for the best and God will
[23:07] bring about the best in the hearts and
[23:08] the lives. whether it's your family or
[23:10] the people you're entering in and
[23:12] dealing with every day. But this is the
[23:14] 55th chapter of Isaiah.
[23:18] And uh
[23:21] it and I was just before I read it, I
[23:23] was just thinking I don't know if some
[23:26] of you have ever been in that state
[23:28] before where you've been so long without
[23:31] water,
[23:33] spent so much time in real hot weather
[23:36] that you've never had a you haven't had
[23:38] water in days or maybe hours. And all of
[23:41] you know that experience when you
[23:43] haven't had water for several hours or
[23:46] days and you take that first glass of
[23:48] water or that first drink, you know, you
[23:51] all know by the time it gets to your
[23:53] mouth, it you realize that your body's
[23:55] absorbing that moisture, absorbing that
[23:57] water before it even gets to your
[24:00] stomach. And I was thinking, what a
[24:02] terrible thing to be a Christian and be
[24:05] that dry and that much lack in the
[24:07] spirit and the presence of Jesus Christ
[24:09] in your heart and your life. And I would
[24:12] never want to be in that situation. But
[24:14] I'll just see what read what God had to
[24:16] say in this 55th chapter here. Ho
[24:19] everyone that thirsts, come ye to the
[24:21] waters. To he that hath no he that hath
[24:24] no money, come ye. Yay. Come buy wine
[24:27] and milk without money with without
[24:30] price. So God offers his gifts to you
[24:33] without price. All you got to do is
[24:35] surrender this morning. Wherefore do you
[24:37] spend money for that which is not bread
[24:39] and labor for that which is
[24:43] Well, let me go to the chapter. I
[24:45] thought I'd print this
[24:47] uh to read it better, but somehow the uh
[24:51] what I printed isn't exactly what the
[24:54] way it's supposed to be in the
[24:55] scriptures this morning. And as some of
[24:58] you have noticed, as I get older,
[25:00] sometimes I drop words out when I read,
[25:03] and I don't mean to do that. So, I'll
[25:05] start from the first verse again. Oh,
[25:07] everyone that thirstth, come ye to the
[25:09] waters. And he that hath no money, come
[25:12] ye and buy and eat. Yeah, come and buy
[25:14] wine and milk without money and without
[25:16] price. That's the same thing God is
[25:18] saying to you all and to me this
[25:20] morning. That that's still here for us
[25:22] today. Wherefore do you spend money for
[25:25] that which is not bread and and your
[25:27] labor for that which is satisfied not.
[25:30] Hearken diligently unto me. Eat ye that
[25:33] which is good and let your soul delight
[25:35] itself in fatness. And that goes about
[25:38] what I was speaking to early in my life.
[25:41] You know, you're eating something that
[25:43] has no value. If you're spending all
[25:44] your time out in the things of this
[25:46] world, you're eating and doing things in
[25:48] your life that have no value. They won't
[25:51] mean anything on the end. And he goes on
[25:53] to say here in the third verse, incline
[25:55] your ear and come unto me and hear, and
[25:58] your soul shall live, and I will make an
[26:00] everlasting covenant with you, even the
[26:03] sure mercies of David. Behold, I have
[26:06] given for a witness to the people, a
[26:08] leader, a commander to the people.
[26:11] Behold, they they shall call a nation
[26:13] that which is not knowest not, that's us
[26:16] here, and a nation that knew not thee
[26:19] shall run unto thee because of the Lord
[26:21] God. For the holy one of Israel, for he
[26:24] hath glorified thee. And a few more
[26:27] scriptures here. And seek ye the Lord
[26:30] while he may found. Call ye upon him
[26:33] while he is near. And we know that's
[26:36] really speaking to us this morning. For
[26:38] let the wicked forsake his ways and the
[26:40] unrighteous man his thoughts. And let
[26:43] him return unto the Lord. We will have
[26:46] mercy upon him to our God for he will
[26:48] abundantly pardon. And that's a
[26:50] comforting thought. You know,
[26:53] I I just know in my own life when I when
[26:56] I intermingle with people out there in
[26:58] the world, the people in this life, you
[27:01] know, you I try never to have a bad
[27:04] thought about people, no matter how bad
[27:06] you think they are or how corrupt they
[27:08] can be. You want to keep your heart and
[27:11] your soul in a position where you're not
[27:13] accountable for anything. But I know
[27:15] that I've seen people in my life that
[27:17] you thought they were no there was no
[27:19] hope for that they were headed to
[27:22] oblivion and then all of a sudden you
[27:24] see them a year later or a month later
[27:28] and they're a totally different person.
[27:30] So it's not us to judge but let God's
[27:33] word have its effect in their lives. And
[27:35] he goes, "For my thoughts are not your
[27:37] thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
[27:39] sayeth the Lord. For as the heavens are
[27:42] higher than the earth, so are my ways
[27:44] higher than your ways, and my thoughts
[27:46] than your thoughts. For as the rain
[27:48] cometh down, this this scripture really
[27:52] stri speaks to me here. For as the rain
[27:55] cometh down, and the snow from the
[27:57] heavens, and returneth not thither, but
[27:59] the waterth the earth, and maketh it
[28:01] bring forth bud, that it may give seed
[28:04] to the sewer, and bread to the eater.
[28:06] You know, sometimes when you're God is
[28:10] thinking about the needs of his people
[28:13] before we even think about it. You think
[28:15] about how God sees the mountains with
[28:17] snow through the winter time. And that
[28:20] very snow is providing substance in the
[28:22] way of water for the whole earth
[28:24] throughout the year when they're thin in
[28:26] the dry place. And I it just strikes me
[28:29] that God is thinking about the needs
[28:30] that you might have a month from now, a
[28:34] year from now, two years from now, or
[28:36] even tomorrow. God has you in his hands.
[28:38] He's thinking about you and how he's
[28:41] going to provide for you before you even
[28:43] know it. So, it's a comforting thought
[28:45] to me. So shall my uh uh I lost my
[28:49] place. You'll have to forgive me here.
[28:51] So shall my word be that goeth forth out
[28:53] of my mouth. It shall not return unto me
[28:56] void, but it'll accomplish that which I
[28:59] pleased, and it shall prosper in those
[29:02] things whereof I sent it. For you shall
[29:04] go out with joy. You shall be led forth
[29:07] with peace, and the mountains and the
[29:09] hills shall break forth before you and
[29:11] singing,
[29:14] and trees of the field shall clap their
[29:17] hands. Instead of thorn shall come up
[29:20] the fur tree. Instead of the brier shall
[29:23] come up the myrtle tree. I I want that
[29:25] in my life. I don't want any sticky
[29:27] things in me. And it shall be to the
[29:29] Lord for a name and for an everlasting
[29:32] sign shall it be cut off.
[29:37] And I I just think as I go into another
[29:40] year,
[29:42] excuse me, I know in my own life, I
[29:44] don't want to be the same a year from
[29:46] now that I am. I want to scripturally
[29:48] and physically, spiritually, I want to
[29:50] be better off a year from now than I am
[29:53] this morning. And I do know um one thing
[29:57] about this life or about being a
[30:00] Christian
[30:02] is not nothing I can do. I know I say
[30:04] this a lot. I can't say it enough. I
[30:06] mean, it's the truth of God's word.
[30:10] It's not us that do it. It's God. You
[30:12] have to count on the Lord to do it for
[30:14] you. You have to it it's hard to
[30:17] explain. I'm just a simple man. You you
[30:20] just have to yield everything that you
[30:22] are to Jesus Christ this morning. You
[30:24] just you I know we don't you have to
[30:27] think put yourself in a perspective
[30:29] where you you got to think you don't
[30:31] have another thing coming to you other
[30:33] than what God has for you. You have to
[30:35] be totally dependent this morning for
[30:37] the gifts that God wants to give you. I
[30:40] know that I I've learned as I get to
[30:42] this age that I can't do it myself. I
[30:45] know I say that and I might go out
[30:46] tomorrow and struggle for eight hours
[30:49] not thinking of asking the Lord how to
[30:50] do something and learn a better way. But
[30:53] I do know one thing as he's teaching me
[30:55] that everything I do is dependent upon
[30:57] him. Brother David
[31:04] Amen.
[31:18] It's good to be here this morning.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Steve wanted me to make
[31:23] sure not to forget to announce there's a
[31:25] national holiday today, brother Brian's
[31:27] birthday today. So, let's give him a
[31:28] hand. Amen.
[31:34] Amen. And also we just have a praise
[31:36] report from sister H or from brother
[31:38] Russell. He said went to the doctor this
[31:41] morning for the pathology report.
[31:43] Perfect report. The doctor had taken out
[31:45] a bunch of the closest lymph nodes and
[31:47] had them biopsied once again looking for
[31:49] any spread. Nothing. Zero zilch.
[31:52] Thanking the Lord for a total
[31:54] deliverance. Amen. Let's give the Lord a
[31:56] hand of praise for that this morning.
[32:00] Amen. It's also good to see brother
[32:01] Glenn here this morning. I'm glad you're
[32:02] It's good to see brother Glenn here this
[32:04] morning. Feeling better. Amen. Let's
[32:05] give the Lord a hand for praise.
[32:09] Amen. Let's sing the same God that spoke
[32:11] to the woman's bone. Let's stand this
[32:12] morning as we sing this.
[32:15] The same God
[32:18] who spoke to
[32:20] the woman at
[32:23] the well.
[32:26] The same God
[32:28] whose wonders
[32:30] too many
[32:32] to tell.
[32:36] The same God
[32:38] who parted
[32:40] the raging
[32:43] red sea.
[32:47] Oh, he's the same God
[32:50] who's living
[32:52] in me.
[32:57] And I look back
[33:00] on history,
[33:02] see the mighty God
[33:05] unveiled.
[33:07] He's proving
[33:10] over and over.
[33:12] That his word can never fail.
[33:18] But I can't keep on dwelling
[33:22] on some past me.
[33:29] Cuz he's the same God
[33:32] who's living in me.
[33:39] Oh, the same God
[33:42] who spoke to
[33:44] the woman at
[33:47] the well.
[33:49] The same God
[33:52] whose wonders
[33:54] too many
[33:56] to tell.
[33:59] The same God who parted
[34:04] the raging
[34:06] with sea.
[34:10] Oh, he's the same God
[34:14] who's living in me.
[34:20] And the same God who created
[34:25] all the heavens and all the earth
[34:31] who came back living in Jesus.
[34:35] There was power
[34:38] in his word.
[34:41] And now in these last days,
[34:45] I'm beginning
[34:47] to see
[34:52] that it's the same God
[34:55] who's living
[34:57] in me.
[35:01] Oh, the same God who spoke to you. The
[35:08] woman at
[35:10] the well.
[35:12] The same God
[35:14] whose wonders
[35:17] too many
[35:19] to tell.
[35:22] The same God
[35:24] who parted
[35:27] the raging
[35:29] red sea.
[35:33] No, he's the same God
[35:36] who's living
[35:38] in me.
[35:43] And we've got the power in the name of
[35:45] Jesus.
[35:47] Oh, give me your hand.
[35:53] Let's agree together
[35:59] that all of our eneies
[36:04] will crumble at our feet.
[36:10] Whatever
[36:12] we find on earth,
[36:16] it shall be bound in heaven.
[36:22] At the name of Jesus,
[36:28] Satan has to flee.
[36:33] Oh, we've got the power
[36:39] in the name of Jesus.
[36:45] We've got the power
[36:50] in the name of the Lord.
[36:57] handle Satan ragees.
[37:02] We cannot be defeated
[37:07] cuz we've got the power
[37:13] in the name of the Lord.
[37:19] And for many years now,
[37:24] Satan's tried to stop us.
[37:29] Oh, but the pride of Jesus.
[37:35] The Lord is still alive.
[37:40] And like a mighty
[37:42] army,
[37:46] we keep maring onward,
[37:51] winning every battle
[37:56] because the Lord's on our side.
[38:02] We've got the power
[38:07] in the name of Jesus.
[38:12] Oh, we've got the power
[38:18] in the name of the Lord.
[38:24] And though Satan rages,

[46:47] morning. Some very serious prayer
[46:48] requests. Amen. So, let's sing this song
[46:51] before we go to prayer.
[46:53] Why would I worry when giants come
[46:58] calling my name?
[47:04] Cuz my God is so much bigger than
[47:09] troubles I face.
[47:16] And why would I hunger for power,
[47:21] riches, or fame?
[47:27] Cuz my God is so much better than all of
[47:32] these things.
[47:37] So I won't be shen.
[47:42] I won't be moved.
[47:48] My God is faithful
[47:53] and his promise is true.
[47:58] So I speak to the mountains.
[48:04] It's time to move.
[48:09] Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[48:15] greater than you.
[48:21] And my eneies scatter cuz they know the
[48:26] battle is won.
[48:32] For my God is stronger. The victories
[48:37] already won.
[48:42] Yes, he died for my ransom and rose up
[48:47] on the third day.
[48:53] Cuz my God is greater than death.
[48:58] hell and the grave.
[49:03] So I won't be shen.
[49:08] Oh, I won't be moved.
[49:14] My God is faithful.
[49:19] His promise is true.
[49:24] So I speak to the mountains.
[49:30] It's time to move.
[49:35] Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[49:40] greater than you. So I won't be shaken.
[49:45] Oh, so I won't be shaking.
[49:51] I won't be moved
[49:56] for my God is faithful
[50:01] and his promise is true.
[50:06] So I speak to the mountains.
[50:12] It's time to move.
[50:17] Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[50:23] greater than you.
[50:28] Amen. You may have your seats this
[50:29] morning as we go to prayer. Amen.
[50:31] Brother Caleb and Brother Daniel and
[50:33] Brother Paul, would you come this
[50:34] morning? Take up the offering.
[50:40] Amen. Amen. Um, sister Adrianne asked we
[50:44] please continue to pray for Mansky, her
[50:46] mom and her son this morning. Also
[50:49] prayer request for Sister Hannah. She
[50:50] says, "Please pray for Aaron Foster.
[50:52] He's in the ICU with possible stroke.
[50:55] He's in a very bad place in life and
[50:57] needs Jesus. We ask that you pray that
[50:59] whatever it takes that this would be a
[51:01] turning point for him. So, we want to
[51:03] remember him this morning. Remember the
[51:04] Brad. I wonder if you'd come and take
[51:06] this before the throne.
[51:12] How many knows our enemy is a defeated
[51:14] enemy?
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Our God is bigger. He's greater. He's
[51:19] stronger. He's more powerful than
[51:21] anything that stands against us. So, we
[51:24] just go before him today and ask that he
[51:26] moves these mountains for us. Heavenly
[51:28] Father, we come before you tonight or
[51:30] this evening or morning, Lord, rather.
[51:32] We're just asking, Lord, that you would
[51:33] come on your way this morning in a
[51:35] special way, Father. that you would just
[51:37] come down and sweep through the
[51:38] congregation this morning. We're
[51:40] grateful today, Lord, just to be in your
[51:42] house just to come and hear from you. We
[51:45] knowing, Lord Jesus, that we not only
[51:47] come to hear from you, but we come to
[51:48] see you in power and demonstration. And
[51:51] that's why we come to you in prayer this
[51:52] morning. Lord, you see these mountains
[51:55] and brother Josh called them mountains
[51:57] because us as humans, as individuals, we
[52:00] can't move them. We can't change
[52:01] situations. We can't do it. But Lord,
[52:05] with the faith of the grain of a mustard
[52:07] seed, we can move mountains one stone at
[52:09] a time, one pebble at a time. And our
[52:11] enemy, we know, is defeated already by
[52:14] the blood that was shed on Calvary. It's
[52:16] just us bringing a petition before you
[52:18] this morning, Lord, that you would
[52:20] calling upon you, that you would move on
[52:21] the scene and show yourself as mighty
[52:24] and as warrior, fighting our battles for
[52:26] us, Lord. So Lord, you know the
[52:29] decisions that have to be made and the
[52:31] the the
[52:33] condition that Aaron's in this morning,
[52:35] Lord, and you know, he physically needs
[52:37] a touch from you. But Lord, spiritually,
[52:39] we ask that he would make a decision for
[52:40] you this morning. That he would turn his
[52:43] heart, Lord. That's the most important
[52:44] thing. These old bodies, they'll fade
[52:46] away. They'll fail us. They'll fall
[52:48] apart. They'll they they'll end up
[52:50] dying. But Lord, the spirit, man, the
[52:53] inside is what lives forever in the name
[52:55] of Jesus Christ. So Lord, we just ask
[52:57] that you be with him. Those that have a
[52:59] need physically and need a touch from
[53:01] you that you would just move on the
[53:03] scene. We're thankful for the
[53:04] testimonies we've heard and how you've
[53:06] moved in and in in a mighty way, Lord.
[53:08] So we just ask that you would show
[53:10] yourself once again as healer and
[53:12] deliverer and redeemer this morning,
[53:15] Lord. Lord, you know, we take this time
[53:17] for the offering, Lord. And it's just a
[53:19] little time in in the day that we take
[53:21] just to give back because you've given
[53:23] so much to us. And Lord, we know that
[53:26] you just bless and you've blessed this
[53:28] church. And not only financially, but as
[53:30] as the movement of the spirit and as the
[53:32] word goes forth, we see people growing
[53:35] and we see people in under deliverance
[53:37] and we see homes getting stronger and
[53:39] and our youth growing in your word,
[53:41] Father. And we just ask this morning,
[53:43] Lord, as we give, you just ask, we ask
[53:45] that you just continue to give to us and
[53:47] bless us, Lord. So, bless this offering
[53:50] now and those that can give and those
[53:51] who cannot. be with our pastor this
[53:53] morning as he delivers the word and give
[53:55] him the strength and give him the wisdom
[53:58] and the courage to stand boldly and
[54:00] preach the word that we need to hear in
[54:02] our heart. We love you Lord with all of
[54:04] our hearts in Jesus name.
[54:07] So I won't be shamed
[54:13] won't be moved.
[54:18] My God is faithful
[54:23] and his promise is true.
[54:28] So I speak to the mountains.
[54:34] It's time to move.
[54:39] Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[54:45] greater than you.
[54:49] Amen. It's already done.
[54:52] Oh, it's already done.
[55:00] Oh, it's already done.
[55:07] For the battle is over
[55:12] and the victory is won.
[55:16] It's already done.
[55:22] And my family is here.
[55:29] Oh, my family is here.

[55:44] And it's already done. I'm already
[55:49] healed
[55:51] and I'm already here.
[55:58] Oh, I'm already here.
[56:05] The battle is over.
[56:09] The victory is won.
[56:12] And it's already done. And I'm already
[56:18] here.
[56:20] Oh, I'm already here.
[56:26] Oh, I'm already here.
[56:33] For the battle is over
[56:37] and the victory is won.
[56:41] And it's already done.
[56:45] It's already done.
[56:48] It's already done.
[56:54] Oh, it's already done.
[57:02] For the battle is over.
[57:06] The victory is won.
[57:09] And it's already done.
[57:16] Amen. Can we sing childier cries have
[57:18] awoken the master this morning?
[57:23] Oh, crossing the calm sea with Jesus.
[57:29] The disciples were getting concerned.
[57:35] The wind started violently blowing,
[57:41] but he was asleep in the stern.
[57:47] And does he not care that we perish?
[57:52] We're helpless and we're so afraid.
[57:58] Jesus arose when they called him
[58:03] and said to them, "Where is your faith?"
[58:08] And because you prayed,
[58:13] "Oh, cuz you've held on with all of your
[58:18] might.
[58:19] Child, your cries
[58:23] have woken
[58:25] the master.

[1:01:43] of my soul.
[1:01:50] Bread of heaven.

[1:02:03] Here's my cup.
[1:02:07] Fill it up and make me whole.
[1:02:15] Amen. Good morning.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Good to be back in the house of the
[1:02:19] Lord. Good to see everybody out this
[1:02:21] morning. You can be seated for a minute.
[1:02:23] Brother Glenn, he's got a testimony he
[1:02:25] wants to give. Let me get you the mic.
[1:02:27] Brother Glenn, come on up here.
[1:02:36] I'm just glad to see brother Glenn doing
[1:02:38] better.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Well, thank you all. I have a little
[1:02:46] testimony.
[1:02:48] First of all, I want to thank Jesus
[1:02:49] Christ for coming into my life and
[1:02:52] making me well. And I want to thank my
[1:02:55] wife for dragging me from the living
[1:02:58] room to the bedroom and then calling an
[1:03:01] ambulance and sending me off to the
[1:03:03] hospital. Uh the first time I ever been
[1:03:06] in an ambulance and I was started I
[1:03:10] guess I was fainted or something cuz I
[1:03:13] started coming too and it was real dark
[1:03:16] and there was little red, green and blue
[1:03:19] lights blinking over on the side and
[1:03:22] these two men were interrogating me.
[1:03:25] They were asking me all these questions.
[1:03:27] So finally
[1:03:29] I thought I was captured by the
[1:03:31] Russians. So I gave them my name, my
[1:03:34] rank, and my service number. And then I
[1:03:37] shut my mouth. So we got to the
[1:03:40] hospital, I guess, because I woke up in
[1:03:42] a bed. And first thing I asked was,
[1:03:45] "Where's my wife?" And they said, "Well,
[1:03:47] she's around." And then anyway, I heard
[1:03:50] the doctor, he told, did he tell you my
[1:03:53] oxygen saturation was like
[1:03:58] something like 82?
[1:04:01] Uhhuh.
[1:04:03] Well, yeah, my blood pressure was up. My
[1:04:05] oxygen saturation was like 55 to or 60
[1:04:10] something. Anyway, it was like I was
[1:04:14] just out of it. So, I got home finally
[1:04:18] and I was in bed. I don't remember much.
[1:04:21] Somehow another I got there. She said
[1:04:23] that she put me there. But, uh, all of a
[1:04:27] sudden,
[1:04:28] this song came on. It was called the
[1:04:31] shepherd of my valley. And let me tell
[1:04:34] you what, I was way down in the valley,
[1:04:38] people. Jesus Christ came and saw me. I
[1:04:41] looked over and here was Jesus pointing
[1:04:44] at me and telling me to come. And he was
[1:04:48] dressed in a robe that was purple and
[1:04:51] off-white stripes.
[1:04:54] Now, I was probably hallucinating, but I
[1:04:56] I would rather think that Jesus came and
[1:05:02] brought me out. Okay. So, anyway, to
[1:05:06] make a long story short, I'm getting
[1:05:08] better, but my nose still runs like a
[1:05:10] river. My eyes looks like I'm crying all
[1:05:13] day long, but other than that, and my
[1:05:16] throat. But next week, if the Lord's
[1:05:19] willing, I'm going to sing that song.
[1:05:21] The sheep, the shepherd of my valley.
[1:05:24] What an uplifting, beautiful song. Once
[1:05:27] I heard that and I saw Jesus, I sat
[1:05:29] right up and he just took me right out
[1:05:32] of the valley cuz I'll swear to you
[1:05:35] right now, I was on my way out. I I gave
[1:05:39] up. I said, you know, this is it. So, I
[1:05:42] want to thank Jesus Christ for being
[1:05:45] here with me.
[1:05:48] I also want to thank my preachers. Oh,
[1:05:54] uh, Brother Thomas, Brother Brad. Uh,
[1:05:58] and I want to open my Bible and look at
[1:06:00] one little verse. It's in Isaiah.
[1:06:06] I think I can I think I can find it.
[1:06:12] Brother Brad read it this morning. It's
[1:06:14] Isaiah
[1:06:16] 55
[1:06:18] and it is
[1:06:20] verse 7.
[1:06:22] Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
[1:06:25] unrighteous man his thoughts,
[1:06:29] and let him return unto the Lord, and he
[1:06:32] will have mercy upon him, and to our
[1:06:35] God, for he will abundantly pardon.
[1:06:39] That speaks right about me, brothers.
[1:06:42] I'm a witness. Five years ago before, I
[1:06:47] was like I told brother Thomas, I was
[1:06:50] sinning and grinning. If there was a sin
[1:06:52] to commit, I would do it. But once I got
[1:06:56] here and I walked into this sanctuary, I
[1:06:59] could feel like Jesus Christ was right
[1:07:03] there with me. So, I want to thank all
[1:07:07] of you for what you've done for me
[1:07:10] because being with Christians and this
[1:07:13] wonderful fellowship is the greatest
[1:07:16] thing I've ever felt. And this is the
[1:07:18] best I've ever felt in my life. God
[1:07:22] bless all of you and thank you.
[1:07:33] Amen. How many enjoyed that?
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; That's wonderful. Amen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to see the grace of God?
[1:07:39] Just take a look. That's the grace of
[1:07:41] God. That's what the grace of God will
[1:07:43] do for a man. Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Also want to make an
[1:07:47] announce couple announcements before we
[1:07:49] get going. Um, November 1st is about the
[1:07:54] only day really that's working out for
[1:07:56] us for our fall festival. So, the first
[1:07:59] weekend in November or November 1st. And
[1:08:02] also, we're going to move our spring
[1:08:03] meetings a little bit uh this spring.
[1:08:07] So, you can write these numbers down if
[1:08:09] you don't want if you want to try to
[1:08:10] make plans for those. Amen. Uh, and that
[1:08:13] is April 16th through the 19th. That's
[1:08:16] this next spring. Okay. Amen. Praise the
[1:08:19] Lord. Let's stand. We'll just get into
[1:08:22] the word of God this morning.
[1:08:24] Good to be in the house of the Lord.
[1:08:26] Good to see everybody out. Amen. Good to
[1:08:29] see doing better. I know that CO Amen.
[1:08:32] It is some really, really bad stuff. And
[1:08:36] then when you up in age a little bit,
[1:08:37] it's certainly going to make it much
[1:08:39] harder yet. So, we're glad to Amen. have
[1:08:41] him getting over it. Praise the Lord. A
[1:08:43] lot of folks go to that hospital and
[1:08:45] they don't come out. So, we're glad to
[1:08:47] have him out and back in the house of
[1:08:48] God. Amen.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus,
[1:08:52] we come before you once again, Lord,
[1:08:53] this sight of eternity. Lord, thanking
[1:08:56] you, Father, for what you are and for
[1:08:57] what you mean to us, Lord, and how dear
[1:08:59] you are to us, Father. How grateful we
[1:09:02] are to be your children, to be sons and
[1:09:04] daughters of God. To be able to assemble
[1:09:06] ourselves together like this in this
[1:09:08] place, Lord, knowing that just being
[1:09:10] able to come and have church is a
[1:09:13] absolute grand privilege, Lord. And we
[1:09:15] deem it a grand privilege to be here
[1:09:17] this morning, Lord, to come, Father, to
[1:09:20] bring ourselves before you, to present
[1:09:22] ourselves before you, Lord, and to see
[1:09:24] where we're at with you and how that we
[1:09:26] can be get better when we go out those
[1:09:28] doors than when we came in. Lord,
[1:09:30] forgive us of all transgressions, all
[1:09:32] sins, all failures. Lord, we ask God
[1:09:34] that we all covered by the blood. And
[1:09:37] Father, we ask Lord that you would have
[1:09:38] the free reign this morning. That you
[1:09:40] would have liberty to speak, Father,
[1:09:42] what you want to say. Lord, help me to
[1:09:43] get out of the way. That you might use
[1:09:45] my lips to say only what you once said,
[1:09:47] Father, and keep me from saying anything
[1:09:49] in my carnal self or in my own self,
[1:09:51] Lord. But just by the spirit as you give
[1:09:54] us utterance, Lord. We ask God that
[1:09:56] you'd be with Aaron just now, Lord
[1:09:58] Jesus. We ask, Lord, that you'd lead him
[1:10:00] to you, Father, that you'd fill him with
[1:10:02] your spirit. He needs salvation and he
[1:10:03] needs grace, Lord. And we ask for grace
[1:10:06] for him in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:10] Praise the Lord. This will be kind of a
[1:10:13] another part. Amen. On no excuses, which
[1:10:16] we're not going to entitle it that.
[1:10:18] Amen. If you would bring the title up.
[1:10:20] Amen. This is going to be pretty much a
[1:10:23] new thought for me. Amen.
[1:10:26] Paying God his dues.
[1:10:30] paying God his dues.
[1:10:33] Amen.
[1:10:35] Kind of different, isn't it? Amen. So,
[1:10:38] if you will turn your Bible, we'll go to
[1:10:40] the book of
[1:10:43] Psalms.
[1:10:45] Amen. And it was something Brother Brian
[1:10:47] read one of the scriptures that we plan
[1:10:48] on reading this morning. Amen. So, Amen.
[1:10:52] He was right on point this morning.
[1:10:55] Amen. as far as with what I the Lord
[1:10:58] gave me to minister on.
[1:11:00] Amen. So, Psalms
[1:11:03] 96.
[1:11:05] Psalms 96.
[1:11:13] Oh, sing unto the Lord a new song. Sing
[1:11:16] unto the Lord, all the earth. Sing unto
[1:11:19] the Lord and bless his name. Show forth
[1:11:21] his salvation from day to day. Declare
[1:11:24] his glory among the heathen, his wonders
[1:11:27] among all people. For the Lord is great
[1:11:30] and greatly to be praised. He is to be
[1:11:33] feared above all gods. For all the gods
[1:11:37] of the nations are idols. Amen. Doesn't
[1:11:40] that get along go along with what we
[1:11:41] said a long time ago that there's all
[1:11:43] there's a lot of gods, but they're all
[1:11:46] false gods. There's only one real god.
[1:11:48] Amen. Here it says that all those gods
[1:11:50] are just idols. For all the gods of the
[1:11:52] nations are idols, but the Lord made the
[1:11:55] heavens. Honor and majesty are before
[1:11:58] him. Strength and beauty are in his
[1:12:00] sanctuary. Now notice the word give.
[1:12:04] Give unto the Lord, oh ye kindreds of
[1:12:08] people. Give unto the Lord glory and
[1:12:12] strength. Give unto the Lord the glory
[1:12:16] do. Amen.
[1:12:19] do unto his name. Amen. Bring an
[1:12:23] offering and come into his courts. Amen.
[1:12:27] Oh, worship the Lord in the beauty of
[1:12:28] holiness. Fear before him all the earth.
[1:12:31] May God add his blessings to the reading
[1:12:32] of the word. You can be seated this
[1:12:34] morning.
[1:12:36] Amen. I was listening to brother
[1:12:39] Brandham this week and I was listening
[1:12:41] to uh the message uh the church and its
[1:12:45] condition I believe it was and there was
[1:12:47] just a couple statements that he made
[1:12:49] about going back up to the Eskimos way
[1:12:52] up in Canada way up there uh way way up
[1:12:55] in there Saskatchewan he said I think he
[1:12:57] was and he just made a couple statements
[1:12:59] that I really liked. Amen. And I and I
[1:13:02] hit the uh the print, not the print, but
[1:13:04] uh take a picture of the the quote,
[1:13:07] amen, on it. And I thought I'd just
[1:13:09] share with you. But you know, it says,
[1:13:11] "Give unto the Lord the glory due unto
[1:13:14] his name. Bring an offering and come
[1:13:16] into his courts." Amen. In other words,
[1:13:19] bring an offering. Make a sacrifice unto
[1:13:21] God. How many believes that each and
[1:13:23] every one of us this morning did just
[1:13:25] that? We made a sacrifice.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've sacrificed our time. Amen.
[1:13:31] and we don't mind doing it for the Lord.
[1:13:33] A lot of people spend their time on a
[1:13:36] lot of other things other than going to
[1:13:37] church, but we like to make the
[1:13:39] sacrifice of coming amen to the Lord.
[1:13:41] Take the time, Amen, in prayer. Now,
[1:13:44] first I'm going to read you this one
[1:13:46] about He says, "Now way up in there
[1:13:48] where we're going, he says there will be
[1:13:50] many people real poor. Real poor will
[1:13:54] have to sell one of their cows or two or
[1:13:56] three of their sheep or something to get
[1:13:59] to come to the meeting." the old
[1:14:00] Escommer will probably bring some of his
[1:14:03] skins and sell them that he really
[1:14:06] needed for his family to come out. The
[1:14:08] Indian trader will have to do the same.
[1:14:11] Amen. And he says, "So we can at least
[1:14:13] pray for them." And then he makes
[1:14:14] another statement right there when he
[1:14:16] was talking about it. Oh, so them, so
[1:14:18] they're real loyal, he says, to go to
[1:14:20] church no matter how cold it is. They'll
[1:14:22] wrap up in a blanket and sit on a bob
[1:14:24] sled and drive the horse for 30 miles to
[1:14:28] get to go to church. They'll walk
[1:14:30] through the snow drifts and everything
[1:14:31] else, young and old, they'll all group
[1:14:33] together and one family gets the other
[1:14:35] and they start walking and they go. He
[1:14:38] says it's the sacrifice that they make
[1:14:40] is what causes them to get so much out
[1:14:42] of the service. See, when there's no
[1:14:44] sacrifice, there's not much to the
[1:14:46] service.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You have to really get down
[1:14:50] and do something that hurts real bad.
[1:14:54] Amen. Amen. Real bad. He says, "I have
[1:14:58] to lay aside some things and stop to
[1:15:01] work and do this, that, or the other.
[1:15:02] Get to go to church and show God that
[1:15:05] you love him and you make a sacrifice."
[1:15:07] Amen. To go to church. Amen.
[1:15:10] Amen. So, I thought that was pretty
[1:15:11] good. Don't you? Amen. How up there
[1:15:13] they'll go through the snow, everything
[1:15:15] else, and you know, they may go 30
[1:15:17] miles, but you know, a lot of us and we
[1:15:18] know that we have we have to a lot of us
[1:15:21] have to go a lot further than that.
[1:15:22] drive an hour, hour and a half, but at
[1:15:24] least you get to do it in a brother
[1:15:26] Brandham called it an air conditioned
[1:15:27] Cadillac. Amen. Or something, but a nice
[1:15:29] vehicle, an air conditioning and and so
[1:15:31] forth. But you know, I thought, you
[1:15:33] know, I wonder how many of us this
[1:15:34] morning made a sacrifice of taking some
[1:15:37] time for prayer.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many prayed for the church
[1:15:43] service this morning?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Not all hands, but but a few. Amen. So
[1:15:51] you get out of what you kind of put in
[1:15:52] it. Isn't it right?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I don't have a lot of quotes,
[1:15:56] but I do want to kind of just uh uh
[1:15:59] speak on this for a little bit. Paying
[1:16:01] God his dues. Last week, I think it was
[1:16:05] last time we spoke, we speak spoke on no
[1:16:07] excuses. Amen.
[1:16:10] No excuses. And how on that day I
[1:16:13] believe it was we mentioned how that God
[1:16:16] said or the brother Bam talked about how
[1:16:18] he says you know on that day God is
[1:16:20] going to uh ask for a reason. Isn't that
[1:16:24] right? In other words, what I would like
[1:16:26] to say is uh the one thing that all of
[1:16:29] humanity,
[1:16:31] all of all every human being,
[1:16:35] Amen, that God's going to require, Amen,
[1:16:38] is an explanation.
[1:16:41] In other words, you're going to have to
[1:16:42] give an an everybody's going to have to
[1:16:44] give an answer.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; How many knows that every human being
[1:16:51] owes God an answer?
[1:16:56] You owe it to God. You're going to give
[1:16:58] it whether you like it or not. You're
[1:16:59] going to get be you're going to get
[1:17:01] you're going to get the opportunities to
[1:17:03] stand before him and give an answer.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; It's what humanity owes God.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; They owe him that much. Why? Because in
[1:17:14] the world that you and I live in, people
[1:17:16] like to think that there is no God.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; That there is no judgment. There is no
[1:17:20] heaven, no hell. There is no man and a
[1:17:23] woman. trying to defy and destroy
[1:17:25] everything God ever made. Isn't that
[1:17:27] right? That's why all of that is like it
[1:17:29] is. Amen. So, we want to take a couple
[1:17:32] scriptures. If you I don't know if you
[1:17:34] have Revelations up there or not, but
[1:17:36] Revelations 21 is the first one I'd like
[1:17:38] to go to just to look at what the Bible
[1:17:40] says. Amen. And um
[1:17:44] actually, actually, let's go to a
[1:17:46] different one first. We're going to go
[1:17:47] to the one that I think Brother Brian uh
[1:17:50] mentioned. Amen. in Isaiah 55. I believe
[1:17:53] it is Isaiah 55. And this Amen. is going
[1:17:58] to be kind of our foundation that we
[1:18:00] come off of, but I want to just say this
[1:18:04] because it is it was very good. Isaiah
[1:18:06] 55, I believe it was u in verse 9. It
[1:18:11] says, "For as the heavens are higher
[1:18:12] than the earth, so are my ways higher
[1:18:14] than your ways and my thoughts than your
[1:18:17] way thoughts." He says, "And as the rain
[1:18:19] cometh down the snow from heaven and
[1:18:21] returnneeth not thither, but it waterth
[1:18:23] the earth and maketh it bring forth and
[1:18:25] but that it may give seed to the sewer
[1:18:28] and bread to the eater." So God is using
[1:18:30] a type, amen, of sewing and planting and
[1:18:32] rain coming down and so forth. He's
[1:18:35] using that as an example of what his
[1:18:38] word is going to do. Amen. Verse 11, so
[1:18:42] shall my word be.
[1:18:45] So shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:18:48] of my mouth. Amen. Hallelujah. Right
[1:18:51] there, folks, I want you to understand,
[1:18:52] we could preach for three years.
[1:18:56] Cuz how many knows God said a lot of
[1:18:58] things. We're going to take quite a bit
[1:19:00] of time this morning with the help of
[1:19:02] the Lord. Amen. Just to look at some of
[1:19:04] the promises of God. Some of the things
[1:19:06] that has went out of his mouth and
[1:19:08] they're not going to return void.
[1:19:14] Oh, let me pick that thought up again
[1:19:16] here in a little bit. But amen.
[1:19:19] But shall accomplish that which I
[1:19:21] please, and it shall prosper in the
[1:19:23] thing that I sented. I would to God that
[1:19:27] the whole world would really truly
[1:19:29] believe that
[1:19:32] cuz it would it would make them
[1:19:33] different people. It would make young
[1:19:36] people. It would change you when you
[1:19:38] truly believe that what God said is
[1:19:41] going to happen.
[1:19:44] It's not going to fail. It is going to
[1:19:48] happen. It does something for you. It
[1:19:51] gives you a stability. It gives you a
[1:19:53] rock. Amen. Because man's word fails.
[1:19:56] There's nothing sure. Nothing is
[1:19:58] everything is sinking sand except for
[1:20:01] the word of God. It cannot be moved.
[1:20:04] Amen. It is not shifting sands. Heaven
[1:20:07] and earth will pass away, but my word
[1:20:09] shall never pass away.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; It gives an anchor.
[1:20:15] How many's resting on that? Oh, I got
[1:20:17] some good stuff. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:20] Oh my. Amen.
[1:20:24] All right. So, Revelations now, let's
[1:20:26] look at the word of God. Look at what he
[1:20:28] said is when it comes to giving an
[1:20:30] answer. And I just want to say that
[1:20:33] every deed of every person in all of
[1:20:35] humanity, Amen, through the prophet of
[1:20:38] God, we know that a a person is recorded
[1:20:41] from the time they are born from the
[1:20:44] womb.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a recorder that goes on,
[1:20:48] amen. And everything that child ever
[1:20:51] does from the time that they're born
[1:20:53] till the time that they are that they
[1:20:55] die and Amen. and pass away, it is on a
[1:20:58] record.
[1:21:01] Amen. You are you're on God's selfie.
[1:21:05] God is taking a selfie of you whether
[1:21:08] you like it or not. You know how mad
[1:21:10] people get out on the streets when
[1:21:11] people take videos of them. They'll go
[1:21:13] out and knock their d. Don't you take a
[1:21:15] picture of me and they get all hostile.
[1:21:16] Well, I have news for you. You're on
[1:21:19] candid camera, folks.
[1:21:21] Everybody's on candid camera, so to
[1:21:23] speak. Amen. And and I, brother Ben,
[1:21:25] make it clear. Even the color of your
[1:21:27] clothes, every action, every move
[1:21:31] is recorded. And not only that, but
[1:21:33] every thought that goes through your
[1:21:35] mind,
[1:21:37] it's recorded also.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. This morning, we want to also help
[1:21:41] and look at the value and how much that
[1:21:44] means, how much it means. Amen. To have
[1:21:47] your sins forgiven. Amen. Why why
[1:21:50] justification means so much to us. Why
[1:21:54] grace means so much to us. Why he means
[1:21:58] so much to us.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Why he meant so much to John the
[1:22:02] Revelator.
[1:22:03] Amen. But that's down the road. Okay,
[1:22:05] let's read. After the thousand years,
[1:22:08] we're going to take a little trip over
[1:22:10] to the other side of a thousand-year
[1:22:12] reign with Christ. Of course, after the
[1:22:14] tribulation period. And verse 7 of
[1:22:16] chapter 20 of Revelation says, "And when
[1:22:18] the thousand years were expired, Satan
[1:22:21] was loosed out of his prison and he'll
[1:22:23] go out and deceive the nations which are
[1:22:24] in the four corners of the earth and so
[1:22:26] forth." Now after this after that it it
[1:22:30] says that he is uh let's go to verse 10.
[1:22:32] And the devil that deceived them was
[1:22:34] cast into the lake of fire and brimstone
[1:22:36] where the beast and the false prophets
[1:22:38] are. And these shall be tormented day
[1:22:39] and night forever and ever. And I saw a
[1:22:43] great white throne and him that sat on
[1:22:45] it from whose face the earth and the
[1:22:49] heavens fled away. Amen. I do not
[1:22:52] understand just what that means.
[1:22:55] But I know that uh I forget his name
[1:22:57] now, but this certain brother that was
[1:22:59] an evangelist, if you remember when he
[1:23:00] come up before the throne, Amen. he
[1:23:02] appealed his case to the white throne
[1:23:04] and he went through way out there to the
[1:23:06] white throne. Isn't that right? Amen.
[1:23:09] And so perhaps perhaps what this is
[1:23:11] talking about this is nowhere close to
[1:23:13] the earth or the heavens. It's way out
[1:23:15] there somewhere. Amen. From whose face
[1:23:17] the earth and the heavens fled away and
[1:23:19] there was found no place for them. And I
[1:23:22] saw the dead small and great stand
[1:23:25] before God. And the books were opened
[1:23:27] and another book was open which is the
[1:23:28] book of life. And the dead were judged
[1:23:31] out of those things were written written
[1:23:33] in the books according to their works.
[1:23:38] Wow. The sea gave up the dead which were
[1:23:40] in it. Death and hell delivered up the
[1:23:42] dead were in it. How many knows there's
[1:23:44] no escape? I don't care how how far gone
[1:23:46] you are. I don't care if you're in the
[1:23:48] pits of hell somewhere. God's going to
[1:23:50] call you and you're going to come back
[1:23:52] up.
[1:23:54] You're going to stand before him.
[1:23:57] Amen. Well, let that ring out through
[1:24:00] our nation. Let that ring out through
[1:24:02] the world. You will stand before God
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; and you will give an account. You will
[1:24:10] pay for your sins. How many know as
[1:24:11] brother Ram said, we know the Bible says
[1:24:13] that. Amen. Every sin, every wrong deed,
[1:24:16] everything that people do, they're going
[1:24:18] to have to pay for it.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Well, fast forward it a little, brother
[1:24:28] B. Tell me about the grace of God and
[1:24:30] what takes away that. You know how that
[1:24:32] Christ paid for it. And when you're in
[1:24:34] Christ, you know, he paid the debt. He
[1:24:37] did not owe. I owed a debt I could not
[1:24:39] pay. I needed someone to wash my sins
[1:24:41] away.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; We'll get to that in a minute. But
[1:24:43] that's right. You know, and if it isn't
[1:24:45] in that channel, everything has to be
[1:24:47] paid for.
[1:24:50] That's right. Right here, we know it's
[1:24:53] the word of God. My word shall not come
[1:24:55] back. Boy, this is going to happen. just
[1:24:58] as sure as the world.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. But how many knows that the bride
[1:25:04] is with him? She's not going to be at
[1:25:07] this white throne judgment. She's going
[1:25:09] to be there with God. He comes with 10
[1:25:12] thousands of his saints to execute
[1:25:14] judgment upon all the wicked. The book
[1:25:16] of Daniel talks about how when he comes,
[1:25:18] Amen. Even Paul said, "Don't you know
[1:25:20] that the saints shall judge the world?"
[1:25:23] One place, Brother Bram says, a pastor
[1:25:25] will judge that area of a local area.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. All right. Now,
[1:25:37] that's right. So he says now look and
[1:25:39] they were listen gave up the debt that
[1:25:42] were in it death and hell delivered up
[1:25:43] the debt which were in them and they
[1:25:45] were judged every man according to his
[1:25:49] word. Not just some every man that was
[1:25:53] standing there.
[1:25:57] Huh?
[1:25:59] This just comes to mind. Is that okay?
[1:26:01] Notice he said death and hell, the grave
[1:26:03] and everywhere else. But it never said
[1:26:05] about those that are in heaven.
[1:26:08] Why? Because there is therefore now no
[1:26:11] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:26:13] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:26:15] after the spirit. There is no judgment.
[1:26:17] You've passed from judgment. How many
[1:26:19] believe that's what the believer has
[1:26:21] done?
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:24] So let's the first part of this I've got
[1:26:27] about three different phases but this
[1:26:29] first part we want to establish that
[1:26:31] Amen. that you know the deeds of
[1:26:33] everybody. Amen. First of all, God is
[1:26:36] God.
[1:26:38] And because that he has made man, he
[1:26:43] makes man responsible. He makes man
[1:26:46] accountable.
[1:26:48] Amen.
[1:26:50] Whether they want to or not.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; I believe in Romans there, it says or
[1:26:55] seventh chapter somewhere in there,
[1:26:57] ninth perhaps, it talks about, can the
[1:26:59] thing formed say to him that formed it,
[1:27:01] why hast thou made me thus? Amen.
[1:27:05] Never ask God, "Well, how why did you
[1:27:07] make me this way?" No. Just say, "Lord
[1:27:09] Jesus, if I'm not what I ought to be,
[1:27:11] you you keep molding and making me the
[1:27:14] way that I ought to be." Amen. Thank
[1:27:15] you, Lord. He had a purpose in doing it.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, how many knows that
[1:27:22] in this world nothing's free?
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. People think, well, you know,
[1:27:28] sometime business and everything, man,
[1:27:30] they'll have a open house and I'll come
[1:27:32] and get you a drink and come get you
[1:27:34] some barbecue and a come and eat a good
[1:27:38] meal and you go there and you know, but
[1:27:41] you know, any business, any smart person
[1:27:43] like that, there's a motive behind why
[1:27:45] they're feeding you a meal.
[1:27:48] They're hoping that when you come around
[1:27:50] and you do that, hey, these people were
[1:27:52] nice, so the next time I need what they
[1:27:54] got, Amen, I'm going to go to them and
[1:27:56] get was their motive to build their
[1:27:58] business. There's always a reason behind
[1:28:00] it.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; All right. So, but anyway, and but you
[1:28:04] know, we're told and we're taught by the
[1:28:06] Bible that Amen. that Jesus, he paid a
[1:28:08] debt that he did not owe. We ought he
[1:28:10] could not pay. Amen. And that it's a
[1:28:12] free gift. That salvation is absolutely
[1:28:15] a free gift.
[1:28:18] It is a free gift of God.
[1:28:22] Sure, he paid something that you
[1:28:24] couldn't do if you had all of Trump's
[1:28:26] money. You could never buy peace. Not
[1:28:29] even a little bit of peace you couldn't
[1:28:31] buy to have your sins forgiven. Not even
[1:28:34] a little bit if you had a billion
[1:28:35] dollars. Because I'm telling you, if you
[1:28:38] would say, "Well, look, if you come up
[1:28:39] with a billion dollars, Amen. you'll be
[1:28:42] saved." There's a lot more billionaires.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Ain't no telling what
[1:28:47] people would do to become a billionaire.
[1:28:49] They do anything for that. I don't know
[1:28:53] so for sure though because a lot of them
[1:28:55] don't want it. Even though it's free.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Even though it's free, they still don't
[1:29:00] want it.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:08] I put it this way. I put it this way. A
[1:29:11] gift and salvation is free. But to
[1:29:14] obtain it, you have to pay a price.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; You have to pay a price if you're going
[1:29:20] to obtain this free gift because it was
[1:29:23] certainly not something you could do
[1:29:25] something you could purchase yourself.
[1:29:27] Not you couldn't do it more than
[1:29:29] nothing. There ain't none of us could
[1:29:30] ever do anything like that. It was only
[1:29:33] the precious blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:29:35] bought and paid so that we could accept
[1:29:39] what he's done.
[1:29:41] Amen.
[1:29:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:45] Amen. So
[1:29:48] another another place I want to go to
[1:29:50] before I go into the area of that we
[1:29:52] have to pay a price and what price we
[1:29:54] have to pay is it found in Mark 9. In
[1:29:57] Mark 9,
[1:29:59] everything we do
[1:30:02] there's a price that comes with it.
[1:30:05] Amen. Either
[1:30:08] it's an indebt or it's a blessing.
[1:30:12] Either good or bad. Jesus said in
[1:30:17] chapter nine of Mark, he says,
[1:30:19] "Whosoever
[1:30:21] shall give
[1:30:23] and for whosoever shall give you a cup
[1:30:25] of water to drink in my name because you
[1:30:29] belong to Christ, verily I say unto you,
[1:30:31] he shall not lose his reward.
[1:30:37] Amen. Even a cup of water, it doesn't
[1:30:41] matter how small it is, God records. God
[1:30:45] knows.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; And another thing, verse 42, it says,
[1:30:52] "Whosoever shall offend one of these, my
[1:30:54] little ones, that believe in me,
[1:30:58] just to offend one of God's children.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; It is better that a millstone were
[1:31:07] hanged about his neck and that he was
[1:31:08] cast into the sea."
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Think about all those martyrs that were
[1:31:14] killed down through our ges. Not just
[1:31:17] offended, but killed and murdered.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't mean to sound crazy here,
[1:31:29] but them people's got hell to pay.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Yeah, they're right.
[1:31:35] They're going to pay in hell
[1:31:38] for a long time for what they did.
[1:31:45] I want to say this. I certainly wouldn't
[1:31:47] want to be f found offending God's
[1:31:50] children or God's church or God's
[1:31:51] people. Amen.
[1:31:54] That a millstone were hanged about his
[1:31:56] neck and that he was cast into the sea.
[1:31:57] Another place Jesus said that every idle
[1:32:01] word that a man speaks, you'll give
[1:32:03] account for.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Every word that you say that you
[1:32:09] oughtn't say, you got to give an account
[1:32:10] for.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; M. Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; It's pretty heavy, isn't it?
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Talk about pain. That's right.
[1:32:20] Every action.
[1:32:21] Praise the Lord. Every offense
[1:32:24] that is committed. Amen.
[1:32:28] Now, let's look look at Matthew
[1:32:31] and let's look at the price that you and
[1:32:33] I have to pay.
[1:32:37] Paying God his dues.
[1:32:42] Amen. Isn't this something how that
[1:32:44] we're living in a world that the bills
[1:32:47] all come due?
[1:32:49] Is that right? Sometimes they're passed
[1:32:51] due.
[1:32:54] This is due. This is passed due and so
[1:32:55] forth. And you got to pay, you know.
[1:32:59] And how many knows when that white
[1:33:00] throne judgment comes, all the bills are
[1:33:03] going to come due?
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Everything anybody ever did is going to
[1:33:08] come due. All right, it's time to pay.
[1:33:11] Amen.
[1:33:14] Amen.
[1:33:15] Okay, let me see here.
[1:33:30] All right, let's first go to uh Luke,
[1:33:35] not Mark, but Luke, I mean Matthew.
[1:33:38] We'll do Matthew next. Luke.
[1:33:44] How many knows that
[1:33:48] to have access and to receive Christ,
[1:33:51] you do have to pay a price?
[1:33:54] Sure you do.
[1:33:56] Amen.
[1:33:59] In chapter 14, the cost of being a
[1:34:02] disciple.
[1:34:04] And there went about great multitudes
[1:34:06] with him. And he turned and said unto
[1:34:08] them, If any man come after me and hate
[1:34:11] not his father, mother, wife, children,
[1:34:13] brothers, sisters, yay, and his own life
[1:34:16] also,
[1:34:18] he cannot be my disciple. And whosoever
[1:34:22] does not bear his cross and come after
[1:34:25] me, he cannot be my disciple.
[1:34:31] Got a price to pay.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:35] For which of you intending to build a
[1:34:37] tower siteth not down first and counts
[1:34:40] the cost?
[1:34:42] Amen. Count the cost. We're living in a
[1:34:45] world, folks, that wants to uh have God,
[1:34:49] have salvation, have eternal life. They
[1:34:52] don't want to pay anything for it.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; They want to give nothing. They want to
[1:34:58] have their own life. They want to do
[1:34:59] their own thing. They want to live like
[1:35:02] uh like uh like Satan tried to offer
[1:35:07] Jesus
[1:35:09] all the kingdoms of the world just no
[1:35:12] Calvary.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; All these will I give you if you'll just
[1:35:16] bow down and worship me. Think about it.
[1:35:19] He was going to give it to him. Isn't it
[1:35:22] something how it took a prophet of God I
[1:35:24] ain't never heard it before. How did it
[1:35:26] took a prophet of God to tell you that?
[1:35:28] That shows that e the kingdoms belong to
[1:35:31] him. That he's got control of them
[1:35:34] because he offered them. He couldn't
[1:35:35] offer him if he didn't have them.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:40] But he tried to offer him. Even brother
[1:35:42] taught, he says he'll offer you going to
[1:35:44] church, be a good member. He'll try to
[1:35:46] offer you being a trustee, a deacon, a
[1:35:48] preacher. Just don't go to Calvary. Just
[1:35:51] don't die to yourself.
[1:35:54] Why? because that still gives him access
[1:35:56] to your life. Still access to
[1:35:58] controlling you.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; And there's millions, I wrote down here,
[1:36:05] billions of people that take that offer
[1:36:09] claiming to be a Christian without a
[1:36:11] Calvary,
[1:36:12] without dying to themselves. You got to
[1:36:15] die. How many knows Jesus died for you?
[1:36:19] You owe him to die for him. Yeah,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; that's what you owe.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He won't accept anything less and
[1:36:28] anything less. He went to the cross and
[1:36:30] he says if you're not willing to take up
[1:36:32] your cross, Amen. then don't bother
[1:36:34] coming. You ain't going to get it unless
[1:36:36] you're willing to die.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Die to your thinking. Die to your plans.
[1:36:41] Die to your life. Die to your goals and
[1:36:44] ambitions.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure you can have goals. Sure you
[1:36:48] can have. God is first. It is pathetic
[1:36:53] how the people amen that God created to
[1:36:56] treat him.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Is that how Israel man how pathetic they
[1:37:01] were Simon when he him to supper
[1:37:03] wouldn't wash his feet wouldn't anoint
[1:37:06] him with all
[1:37:08] wouldn't welcome him. People don't
[1:37:10] welcome him. People don't honor him.
[1:37:14] Give God the glory that's due to his
[1:37:17] name. Amen. How many believe there's
[1:37:20] going to be people that will give him
[1:37:22] the glory that's due to his name? Why?
[1:37:26] Because that word will not come back
[1:37:28] void.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; All right, here we go. We're about ready
[1:37:35] to preach. Now,
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; think about it. If he said that he was a
[1:37:39] healer, there's going to be somebody
[1:37:42] that's going to get healed.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Why? cuz he's not going to come back
[1:37:46] void. If there's somebody that needs
[1:37:49] saving and he's a savior, somebody's
[1:37:52] going to get saved.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; He's a redeemer. He's going to bring
[1:37:56] somebody back.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Woo. He's not going to have his word
[1:38:03] come back void.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; But if he's a savior, he's going to save
[1:38:07] somebody.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how many reject him,
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; there's going to be people that accept
[1:38:14] him.
[1:38:16] Amen.
[1:38:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:21] All right.
[1:38:25] I messed up my glasses and everything.
[1:38:28] Praise the Lord. So now notice. So he
[1:38:30] says, "That's right. You got to sit down
[1:38:33] and count the cost. See what it's going
[1:38:35] to cost you." That's where people fail.
[1:38:40] Amen.
[1:38:45] Lord, help us.
[1:38:48] It'd be nice to have it one day. I
[1:38:51] accept the Lord.
[1:38:53] I died to myself. He filled me with the
[1:38:55] Holy Ghost and that was it. No,
[1:38:59] don't work that way. Why? Because Paul
[1:39:02] said he had to die
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; daily. Every day. As long as you're
[1:39:07] living with this thing, you got to kill
[1:39:09] that thing. You got to die to that
[1:39:11] thing. Like brother Ram says, man,
[1:39:13] people Amen. Young preachers sometimes
[1:39:15] people come begin to preach and they
[1:39:17] begin to think they're somebody.
[1:39:19] Christians, they become Christians, all
[1:39:21] of a sudden they get highly puffed up
[1:39:23] and proud and this that or the other.
[1:39:25] Amen. And you go the exact wrong way.
[1:39:27] The way up is down. Stay down. Get off
[1:39:29] your high horses. Stay on the Damascus
[1:39:32] dust. Realize you're nobody. You're
[1:39:34] nothing without God. We are nothing
[1:39:36] without God. He can do without us, but
[1:39:39] we cannot do without him.
[1:39:47] He's everything.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; He's everything.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:57] That's right.
[1:39:59] On on he goes. Jesus telling about find
[1:40:02] out whether you have sufficiency to
[1:40:04] finish it or not. Amen.
[1:40:09] If you're building a tower on down, if
[1:40:12] your king goes to war with another one,
[1:40:15] you want to figure out whether you can
[1:40:16] win this battle. Amen.
[1:40:20] Amen. Notice it. So likewise, whosoever
[1:40:24] he be of you that forsaketh not all that
[1:40:26] he hath, he cannot be my disciple.
[1:40:31] Amen. You be got to be willing to pay
[1:40:33] the price.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] You want to be a better Christian. You
[1:40:39] want to be closer to God. Look at what
[1:40:41] price you can pay.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we honor our jobs. How we honor
[1:40:47] our bosses. And man, we're there every
[1:40:49] day. Amen. Ours. We do what they're
[1:40:51] told.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? We give honor to our
[1:40:54] jobs. We give honor to our flesh. We
[1:40:56] give honor to Amen things. But where's
[1:40:59] God's honor?
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Where's his respect?
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:41:08] Wait. Oh my.
[1:41:12] A son honorth his father and a servant
[1:41:14] his master. If I then be a father, where
[1:41:17] is my honor? If I be a master, where is
[1:41:21] my fear?
[1:41:23] Sayaith the Lord of hosts unto you
[1:41:25] priests. Amen. Where's my honor? He
[1:41:28] says, how many believes he's a father?
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; He's a master.
[1:41:36] He's our Lord
[1:41:38] and he's worthy of respect.
[1:41:41] He's worthy of honor.
[1:41:44] Give honor to God.
[1:41:47] Glory to God. That's due to him. How
[1:41:51] many believe God is due a lot? The world
[1:41:55] owes God a lot. We owe God everything.
[1:41:59] You wouldn't be sitting there. You
[1:42:00] wouldn't be breathing air if it wasn't
[1:42:02] for God. You wouldn't have a voice if it
[1:42:04] wasn't for God.
[1:42:07] Hallelujah. When we just begin to get
[1:42:09] down to the nitty-gritty, for every drop
[1:42:11] of water we drink. Amen. For every
[1:42:13] breath we take. Amen. Thank you, Lord,
[1:42:15] for having me. Let me not be blind,
[1:42:17] Lord. Thank you that I can jump a little
[1:42:19] bit. Thank you, Lord, for my youth.
[1:42:21] Thank you, Lord, for everything that you
[1:42:22] have given. He's given us everything.
[1:42:24] You ain't got nothing without him.
[1:42:27] Let everything that has breath praise
[1:42:30] the Lord.
[1:42:33] Give praise to him.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Give honor to him with your life and the
[1:42:38] way you live.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that?
[1:42:46] Amen.
[1:42:49] Praise be to God. Come, let us reason
[1:42:52] together, sayeth the Lord. Though your
[1:42:55] sins be as red like crimson, they shall
[1:42:58] be white as snow.
[1:43:01] God is in the business of taking your
[1:43:03] old tattered garment, your old
[1:43:06] meaningless, dead, druggy, and oh,
[1:43:09] horrible life. Amen. And he wants to
[1:43:11] give you a robe of pure white.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; God wants to make a deal with people.
[1:43:20] Bring your old tattered garment, I'll
[1:43:22] give you an old rub.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Take you, give me your sadness, and I'll
[1:43:26] give you joy. Give me your depression
[1:43:28] and I'll give you joy unspeakable.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Give me your sin and I'll wash it white.
[1:43:42] That's why
[1:43:44] man
[1:43:45] has to do drugs,
[1:43:48] alcohol,
[1:43:50] pleasure, anything to take their mind
[1:43:54] off of. No.
[1:43:56] Hello.
[1:43:58] What their soul tells them that there is
[1:44:00] that there's a God that they'll have to
[1:44:03] give an account to try to fill that void
[1:44:06] that's there. That little place in the
[1:44:09] heart that is a void. God put that void
[1:44:12] there. He wanted you to be long. He
[1:44:15] wanted you to be sad. He wanted you to
[1:44:17] be empty. He made a place like that. But
[1:44:20] he don't expect to fill it with the
[1:44:22] things of the world. Amen. And the
[1:44:24] pleasures. Amen. And everything else. He
[1:44:26] expects you to get it filled with him.
[1:44:29] He made you that way so you can have joy
[1:44:32] unspeakable.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Put that in your heart.
[1:44:38] Made you that way. Made all of humanity
[1:44:41] that way.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right.
[1:44:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:50] Aren't you thankful that his word is not
[1:44:53] going to come back
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; void?
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; No. But we say this morning, I believe
[1:45:00] I'm going to fulfill that word. I
[1:45:03] believe you're fulfilling that word.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, when he was coming into Jerusalem
[1:45:08] and they were saying, hosana to him that
[1:45:10] comes upon the fall, hosana, hosana.
[1:45:14] Isn't that right? That's what the Bible
[1:45:15] said that they would do. Amen. And the
[1:45:17] scribes and the Pharisees, they were of
[1:45:19] the opposite side. Tell them to hold
[1:45:21] their peace. Tell them to be quiet.
[1:45:22] Jesus says, "If they be quiet, the rocks
[1:45:25] will immediately cry out." But then
[1:45:27] people didn't let the rocks cry out for
[1:45:28] him. And I'm here to tell you when John
[1:45:31] show, Amen, that's great one. Amen. And
[1:45:34] opened the book and he was worthy to be
[1:45:36] praised.
[1:45:38] Ain't no rocks going to cry out for the
[1:45:40] bride of Jesus Christ. Everything in
[1:45:42] heaven heard me say. Everything under
[1:45:44] the earth. Everything in the sea heard
[1:45:46] me saying, "Worship God." Amen. Worship
[1:45:49] God said, "Glory,
[1:45:51] power, strength be to him that sits on
[1:45:54] the throne."
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And John was a type of you and I.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:46:21] Amen.
[1:46:23] Isn't that what John did?
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; I know preachers say it and it's true to
[1:46:30] a sense
[1:46:32] that it's all about you.
[1:46:36] It's all about us.
[1:46:38] And I'll say this, I believe it's true
[1:46:41] with God, it is all about us. Amen.
[1:46:46] But as speaking for myself,
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. To me, it's all about him.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Just as a young boy and a young girl,
[1:46:56] Amen. dating and loving each other,
[1:46:58] whatever he does, it's all about her.
[1:47:01] And she's the same way. Oh, it's all
[1:47:03] about him.
[1:47:04] Amen. Because when John the Revelator
[1:47:07] when he
[1:47:10] when he seen
[1:47:14] listen to this and I beheld and I heard
[1:47:16] another voice of many angels round about
[1:47:18] the throne and beast and the elders
[1:47:20] number was 10,000 times 10 thousands and
[1:47:23] they sang with a loud voice
[1:47:26] oh I'm so worthy
[1:47:29] no I'm so powerful I'm so rich no he
[1:47:34] said worthy is a lamb that was slain to
[1:47:37] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[1:47:41] strength and glory and blessing and
[1:47:44] every creature heard me saying it.
[1:47:47] Woo. How many believe that you and I I
[1:47:50] believe Evening Light Tabernacle. I
[1:47:52] believe other churches I believe the
[1:47:53] bride. Amen. We're getting into the
[1:47:55] atmosphere. Amen. Of worshiping him. Say
[1:47:58] he is worthy of power. Cuz when we get
[1:48:01] over there, I believe it'll be the same
[1:48:02] thing, brother. Amen. We're going to be
[1:48:04] saying, "God, where you're worthy,
[1:48:06] you're worthy." We'll fall down and say,
[1:48:08] "You are worthy of everything.
[1:48:13] Without you, I'd have never made it. It
[1:48:14] was all about you.
[1:48:19] Amen. We might as well get in the
[1:48:20] atmosphere of what it's going to be over
[1:48:22] there right here.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; I believe we're getting in the
[1:48:27] atmosphere of heaven.
[1:48:32] I ain't waiting. I ain't waiting till I
[1:48:35] get over there to do these things. I
[1:48:37] ain't wait till I get over there to
[1:48:39] shout until the heavens roar.
[1:48:42] I'm going to let the glory rule when the
[1:48:44] road is called in glory. I'm going to
[1:48:47] have the time of my life
[1:48:52] while I'm still in the time of my life.
[1:48:55] I'm having the time of my life.
[1:49:00] Come on, people. Couldn't wait until you
[1:49:02] get over there. Have the time of your
[1:49:04] life. Have a little bit of the time of
[1:49:06] your life right here, right now.
[1:49:12] Woo!
[1:49:14] Come on to football games, they get
[1:49:16] their glory. Basketball, they get their
[1:49:18] glory. Give God the glory that's due to
[1:49:21] him. He is due of our praise.
[1:49:25] He's due of worship.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; God, give me a better body.
[1:49:41] strength.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; While you still got strength,
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; give him praise.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:49:55] All right,
[1:49:58] I got to dress down. Is that all right?
[1:50:03] Don't worry, that's as far as we'll go.
[1:50:11] God is good, isn't he?
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's what I think. I think it's
[1:50:17] about him.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; I think it's about what he does for us.
[1:50:23] And I believe he is worthy. All these
[1:50:26] worldly people and all these other
[1:50:27] things, they're not worthy. Only he is
[1:50:30] worthy. You're not worthy. I'm not
[1:50:32] worthy. so unworthy
[1:50:36] of such mercy. But when he was on the
[1:50:39] cross, I was on his mind.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:46] I was on his mind. He's worthy of
[1:50:50] praise. He's worthy of blessing and
[1:50:53] honor
[1:50:55] and glory
[1:50:58] and dancing
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; and shouting. Amens. Hallelujah.
[1:51:05] His name is above every name.
[1:51:09] There's no name like Jesus, like the
[1:51:14] Lord Jesus Christ. His name is above
[1:51:16] every name, higher than any other name.
[1:51:21] Praise be to God.
[1:51:24] How many knows that God just doesn't run
[1:51:28] his business when he makes a plan? When
[1:51:31] he comes up with a plan,
[1:51:35] he don't run his business half shot.
[1:51:38] When he says something, it's going to
[1:51:41] accomplish what he says.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't come to the cross just to have
[1:51:46] somebody have pity and thinking maybe
[1:51:49] somebody will feel sorry. Hello. Brother
[1:51:53] Bam says, "May I stop here just a moment
[1:51:55] and realize I'm facing clergymen and
[1:51:57] smart men,
[1:51:59] but I just like to say this. I believe
[1:52:01] this and I know it. Jesus never went to
[1:52:04] the cross for some half-hazard affair.
[1:52:07] Perhaps sorry because he died so they'll
[1:52:11] come and get saved." God doesn't run his
[1:52:13] business like that. God runs his
[1:52:15] business by fornowledge.
[1:52:18] knowing before the world was ever
[1:52:19] formed, who was his.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He makes no mistakes. He wouldn't
[1:52:25] bring you in if you wasn't worthy. He
[1:52:29] knows your heart. That's right. He knows
[1:52:32] what you are. Listen now. How did you
[1:52:35] get in there? But for knowledge. God
[1:52:37] said that even Jesus, now put on your
[1:52:40] caps and open your heart. The Bible even
[1:52:43] said Jesus was slain from the foundation
[1:52:46] of the world. Hallelujah. Again, he
[1:52:49] talks about in another quote, not just
[1:52:50] some hazard business. Amen. He says he
[1:52:54] runs his business perfect. That's right.
[1:52:56] He knowed exactly what was going to take
[1:52:57] place. Amen. He would foretell it. He
[1:53:00] knows exactly. Amen. He's not willing to
[1:53:03] perish, but he's not willing. But he's
[1:53:05] infinite. Oh, here we go. Hallelujah.
[1:53:09] Oh my. He knows. If he's infinite, he
[1:53:13] knows who will and who won't. Therefore,
[1:53:17] you can rest assured if you have
[1:53:20] received God and been filled with the
[1:53:22] Holy Ghost, you're anchored to your
[1:53:24] eternal destination.
[1:53:28] How many knows if you've got the baptism
[1:53:30] of the Holy Ghost? One of the great
[1:53:32] revelations is to know who you are, that
[1:53:34] you are a son of God, that you are a
[1:53:37] part of that word.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Behold, what manner of love the Father
[1:53:41] has bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:53:43] called the sons of God. Great
[1:53:45] revelation. No, there was two children.
[1:53:48] There's two children. Two different
[1:53:49] children in the world. How many knows
[1:53:52] that there's two children?
[1:53:54] Cain and Abel. There's wheat and tears.
[1:53:58] Ain't that right? There's two. Amen. A
[1:54:01] lot of people don't know where they
[1:54:02] belong, where they come from. But if you
[1:54:05] know that you were part of God,
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; we ought to be the happiest people.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; You can be the happiest person. I don't
[1:54:14] care if you got nothing. I don't care
[1:54:16] how much else you know. Just so that you
[1:54:18] know that you are God's child. That he
[1:54:21] called you. That he has sustained you.
[1:54:23] He has brought you through every child.
[1:54:25] Amen. And you're still here. Why?
[1:54:27] Because God's word will not come back.
[1:54:30] B.
[1:54:51] Give unto the Lord the glory. Do his
[1:54:54] name. How many believe please? Down at
[1:54:56] the cross where my savior died. Thou
[1:55:00] where from cleansing from sin I cried.
[1:55:02] There too my heart was the blood
[1:55:04] applied. Glory to his name.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; I'm singing glory to his name. I'm
[1:55:11] singing glory to his name.
[1:55:18] You ask me why I'm happy. I'll tell you
[1:55:20] why. Cuz I ain't got to worry about the
[1:55:22] judgment. I ain't got to worry about all
[1:55:24] those things. That's why forgiveness and
[1:55:26] justification mean so much. I never done
[1:55:29] it in the first place. I ain't got to
[1:55:32] worry about that.
[1:55:37] If that don't excite you, then you're
[1:55:40] going to sit in heaven.
[1:55:42] Yeah, I'm justified. Yeah, God forgave
[1:55:44] me.
[1:55:48] Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I'm glad
[1:55:51] that God forgave me. How many glad that
[1:55:53] your sins are forgiven? They're in the
[1:55:55] sea of God's forgetfulness.
[1:56:04] Amen.
[1:56:06] He knew there would be people that would
[1:56:10] be willing to pay the price. They would
[1:56:12] give hot. You can't give them anything.
[1:56:16] Brother Bram says that Easter they will
[1:56:18] bring flowers. Now every bring everybody
[1:56:21] bring a flower, a pot of flowers for the
[1:56:23] Lord on Easter and we'll set them here.
[1:56:26] And if everybody brought some, we'd
[1:56:28] probably have flowers all the way over
[1:56:29] here. Is that right?
[1:56:33] What the prophet of God said, God don't
[1:56:35] want the flowers. God wants your heart.
[1:56:38] I mean, that's what God wants. He wants
[1:56:41] you to give him yourself. He wants your
[1:56:44] love. He wants your appreciation. He
[1:56:47] wants your respect.
[1:56:49] He wants your love. He wants your heart.
[1:56:52] That's what God wants you to give him,
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; your all. He's all and in all. The Bible
[1:56:58] says, do you realize that God wants to
[1:57:00] have the preeminence?
[1:57:02] God wants to be in your life.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; He wants to be a part of you when you
[1:57:07] wake up in the morning, when you go to
[1:57:09] work, when you go back home, whatever.
[1:57:11] He wants to be a part of your life. He
[1:57:14] wants to be in you, fellowshipping with
[1:57:16] you. That's what God wants. That's all
[1:57:20] we can give.
[1:57:23] In my hands, no price I bring. Simply to
[1:57:28] thy cross I cling.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:33] All that I am.
[1:57:37] All that I have, all that I will ever
[1:57:41] be. Cannot repay the love debt I owe.
[1:57:47] Amen. I surrender
[1:57:51] to thee. So all we can do is give
[1:57:54] ourselves.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Surrender to God. See God, here I am. I
[1:57:59] give myself away. I give myself away.
[1:58:03] Amen. I give myself away. That's what
[1:58:06] God wants.
[1:58:09] The fellowship that a husband and a wife
[1:58:13] has. We're in their perfect fellowship.
[1:58:16] Everything's good. There's very few
[1:58:19] things in the world better than that.
[1:58:21] Amen.
[1:58:25] Amen.
[1:58:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:32] God is good.
[1:58:37] Just comes to mind. Kingdom of heaven is
[1:58:39] like a treasure. A man found in a field.
[1:58:41] When he finds it, what's he do? He hides
[1:58:43] and he goes and he sells everything he's
[1:58:45] got and he buys that feel. That's the
[1:58:49] Christian young people remember that you
[1:58:51] go and sell everything you are. Say,
[1:58:52] "God, I'm nothing. My future's is yours.
[1:58:56] Just fill me with your spirit cuz Christ
[1:59:00] eternal life.
[1:59:03] Eternal life. You couldn't b with 10,000
[1:59:07] worlds."
[1:59:09] Hello.
[1:59:11] Each soul, young people, each soul is
[1:59:14] valued at 10,000 worlds, endless
[1:59:17] infinity of how much you're worth. Amen.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; But without the eternal life to come to
[1:59:23] come on the inside, it would have been
[1:59:25] better for you not to been born.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:59:30] Praise be to God.
[1:59:33] Amen.
[1:59:35] Praise the Lord. He gave himself. All we
[1:59:38] can do is give oursel to him.
[1:59:46] I think we should all search our hearts
[1:59:48] this morning.
[1:59:50] See what else you can sacrifice.
[1:59:54] See what else you can surrender to God
[1:59:58] for more of him. How many needs more of
[2:00:00] God?
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; How many's got God?
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; How many's got God? got the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:08] Amen.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; But you know,
[2:00:13] we always want more, don't we?
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; I want more of Jesus. More and more and
[2:00:20] more. I want more of Jesus than I had
[2:00:25] this morning.
[2:00:27] I want more of his great love. So rich,
[2:00:30] so full, and free. I want more of Jesus.
[2:00:34] So, I'm going to have to give him some
[2:00:35] more of my time.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna have to make more sacrifices
[2:00:41] for my prayer life, my dedication, my
[2:00:44] walk with him.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Make time to come to church. Ain't that
[2:00:49] right? When we possibly can. Amen.
[2:00:53] Because he's worthy.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:02] I was just imagining what the world
[2:01:05] would be like if everybody really did
[2:01:08] accept God. If we'd all get the praising
[2:01:11] God and give him praise and do what
[2:01:13] we're supposed to. Why this place? It'd
[2:01:15] be noisy.
[2:01:18] The world would be no. What a kind of a
[2:01:20] world would it be? Well, it' be heaven,
[2:01:23] wouldn't it? Because over there there's
[2:01:25] all the scuffers will undoubters will be
[2:01:27] absent on that day. Heaven's going to be
[2:01:29] full of people that are surrendered that
[2:01:33] have God in their life
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; that worship him.
[2:01:39] But over here we're still
[2:01:42] going through our tests and our trials.
[2:01:46] We still have canes that want to kill
[2:01:47] us. We still have tempters. We still
[2:01:50] have all of these things. Amen.
[2:01:53] But thank the Lord for church.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord we can get together like
[2:01:58] this and around the word of God.
[2:02:08] How do we get washed? By the washing of
[2:02:09] the water. By the word. Isn't that
[2:02:11] right? So when we hear the word, it
[2:02:12] washes us. Right? I was back there
[2:02:14] thinking, you know, if you want to get
[2:02:16] and put your sins in the tub, the bleach
[2:02:19] of Jesus Christ,
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; where is that tub at?
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; I thought, brother Brad, I hope this is
[2:02:26] right. You judge me for but it's right
[2:02:28] here in church.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; This is where the tub is. Not that it
[2:02:34] isn't out there wherever you walk and
[2:02:36] wherever you are, but it's definitely in
[2:02:38] here. When the word's going forth, mercy
[2:02:41] is given. Amen.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We come to the house of God. We
[2:02:46] get washed by the water of the word.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? We're never
[2:02:52] ashamed. How many believe we should
[2:02:53] never be ashamed?
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Never be ashamed.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; I don't care where you are. Praise the
[2:02:59] Lord.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; I remember down in Florida when we was
[2:03:04] laying block on seventhstory building.
[2:03:07] Amen. I don't know who it was, but some
[2:03:10] guy, he'd go out there on the seventh
[2:03:11] floor, first floor, second floor, and
[2:03:13] he'd go, "Praise the Lord."
[2:03:16] He just went around yelling every,
[2:03:18] "Praise the Lord." I said, "Man, that
[2:03:20] whole place should have been ringing
[2:03:22] with that, right?
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; The whole place ought to be ringing.
[2:03:28] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Let all the earth Praise be to God."
[2:03:33] Amen.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. How many knows when he
[2:03:37] all that he is all that he means to us.
[2:03:41] His word
[2:03:42] is what we're born again by. We're a
[2:03:45] part of those thoughts that he had.
[2:03:47] We're part of his word that has went
[2:03:49] forth.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, I was going to skip a lot, but I'm
[2:03:52] going to go ahead and read it.
[2:03:54] What did brother Bam say? Brother Bam
[2:03:57] said that he doesn't run his business
[2:03:58] just by some emotion or affection, but
[2:04:00] he knows he runs it by fornowledge.
[2:04:04] Amen. See, in whom he did forno, then he
[2:04:07] also predestinated to be conformed to
[2:04:09] the image of his son. How many believes
[2:04:12] if that's his word, and if you're the
[2:04:13] predestinated one, God's going to, boy,
[2:04:16] he's going to whip us. He's going to
[2:04:18] beat us. He's going to do whatever it
[2:04:19] takes for us to conform to the image of
[2:04:22] his son. He'll allow trials come.
[2:04:24] Brother Bam says the best thing that we
[2:04:26] ask for a life of ease and life of
[2:04:27] comfort. The best thing God can do is
[2:04:29] give us trials.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had to say it, didn't
[2:04:33] he?
[2:04:38] He had to say it and I got to say it.
[2:04:41] I'm not going to apologize even though I
[2:04:43] thought about it. No, we got to say what
[2:04:45] the prophet said. We He says what the
[2:04:46] pro what the Bible says. Why? Because
[2:04:49] those are the things that mold us. Those
[2:04:51] are the things to show you the
[2:04:53] thermometer of where you're at,
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; of where you're at with God. Put you
[2:04:57] under pressure. See where you're at.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; So, thank God. Why? because he says the
[2:05:04] gold we're
[2:05:07] Peter says that that we ought to have
[2:05:09] the gold, not the gold that perishes.
[2:05:13] All right, I think I can go to it pretty
[2:05:16] quick, baby.
[2:05:18] Let me just read it.
[2:05:26] The trial of your faith being much more
[2:05:28] precious than the gold that perisheth,
[2:05:30] though it be tried by fire might be
[2:05:33] found unto praise and honor and glory at
[2:05:36] the fearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[2:05:38] mean that that the molding that makes
[2:05:40] the coming into his image.
[2:05:42] All the hard times and trials you go to,
[2:05:45] it's not for just over here. is molding
[2:05:47] you for over there.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; So you will shine in his glory.
[2:05:54] When you get over there, you're going to
[2:05:56] say, "Thank you, Lord, for all the hard
[2:05:58] trials that you helped me through. Thank
[2:06:00] you for delivering me this here and
[2:06:02] delivering me from that."
[2:06:06] Woo!
[2:06:07] I'm going to scream. I'm going to
[2:06:09] holler, Brother Brad, because I'm going
[2:06:10] to say, "Man, I know what it's like,
[2:06:12] Amen. to go through a trial." Amen. long
[2:06:15] dark tunnel and finally there's a little
[2:06:17] light at the other end. And you might
[2:06:19] say, "Is that a train?"
[2:06:22] No, it wasn't a train. It was God on the
[2:06:25] other side bringing you through.
[2:06:28] I say, "Thank you, Lord, for bringing me
[2:06:30] through my trials.
[2:06:33] It made me love you more. It made me
[2:06:35] realize the fight's not mine. The fight
[2:06:37] is yours."
[2:06:39] Woo!
[2:06:41] How many's glad that you are bought?
[2:06:43] Jesus said, "You are bought with a
[2:06:45] price." When Jesus come to Calvary, he
[2:06:48] bought you from the devil. He bought you
[2:06:52] off of the devil.
[2:06:55] That's right. You was in his pawn shop.
[2:06:58] The devil was making you whatever he
[2:06:59] wanted made you to do.
[2:07:03] But he bought you. You're not your own.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; How many knows you're not your own
[2:07:07] anymore? You've been bought. Christ paid
[2:07:09] for you.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for that. I heard
[2:07:12] brother Bam just say the other day, you
[2:07:14] are going to be a servant. You are going
[2:07:17] to be a slave to somebody. You're either
[2:07:20] the devil's slave or you're God's slave.
[2:07:22] And I'm telling you what, I don't mind
[2:07:24] being a love slave to Jesus Christ. I
[2:07:27] like being his slave. Oh, what joy it
[2:07:29] gives us
[2:07:33] to be a slave to him.
[2:07:37] When the devil comes and tempts you,
[2:07:39] tell him, "Sorry, devil. I'm bought. I'm
[2:07:42] not for sale. Get on out of here.
[2:07:49] And I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[2:07:51] Christ. For it is the power of God.
[2:07:54] Amen.
[2:08:13] My word shall not come back void.
[2:08:18] If God says that we're to praise him,
[2:08:21] let everybody have breath. Somebody go
[2:08:22] praise him.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; If he's going to have a church without
[2:08:27] spot with wrink without wrinkle.
[2:08:31] If he says that those who he for
[2:08:33] ordained, he uh justified and who he
[2:08:35] justified, he has already glorified.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; I looked into the mirror this morning
[2:08:43] and I realized his old body getting old,
[2:08:47] but I thank the Lord for my body. I
[2:08:50] appreciate still being in the flesh
[2:08:52] here. Amen. I'm glad I'm not crippling
[2:08:55] around and we're getting older. Sure. I
[2:08:57] thank God. But I thought, Lord, this is
[2:08:59] nothing but corruption. Look at animals
[2:09:02] when they die. Amen. I killed a possum
[2:09:06] the other day. He was coming after our
[2:09:08] chickens, eating our eggs. So, yeah. I
[2:09:11] said, I guess I could have hauled him
[2:09:12] off. Donna was in favor of No, but you
[2:09:15] did was great.
[2:09:18] But I left him laying out just for about
[2:09:20] that day. And I didn't get him out that
[2:09:21] day. That evening, she said that thing's
[2:09:23] still laying on there. I went over there
[2:09:25] and maggots already crawling up out of
[2:09:26] it and everything else. Hello. And the
[2:09:29] man if I if you die that'd be your body.
[2:09:32] But Abraham says that that girl that's
[2:09:33] out there with her sexy dress on and
[2:09:36] everything. Don't you realize in two
[2:09:37] three days worms can be crawling in and
[2:09:39] out of your mo nose and everything else.
[2:09:41] This body is nothing but a bunch of
[2:09:42] corruption. But I said, "Lord Jesus."
[2:09:44] And as I looked in the mirror, I said,
[2:09:46] "Lord Jesus, I thank you because I know
[2:09:48] that you have another body for me.
[2:09:50] You've got a theophony body for me. If
[2:09:53] this one goes, I've got another one
[2:09:55] waiting. Woo. And I'm looking forward to
[2:09:57] be in that body. Aren't you? Amen.
[2:10:00] There'll be no temptation. There'll be
[2:10:01] no down. No, no mistake. Nothing on that
[2:10:03] one. Woo. We ought to be happy. Oh, the
[2:10:09] I hear it's calling me. It's calling. Do
[2:10:13] a little better. Come up a little
[2:10:15] higher. Come up a little higher into the
[2:10:20] perfect word. Amen. I hope that we've
[2:10:24] got more people who sp theophonyy's
[2:10:26] calling as we get older. Brother Glenn,
[2:10:28] sister shared, we've got a theophony
[2:10:30] body waiting for us. Hallelujah.
[2:10:34] Aren't you glad that God has already
[2:10:36] made for you?
[2:10:41] Woo.
[2:10:43] I'm just going to have a good time. Is
[2:10:44] that all right? Let's go a little long
[2:10:45] this morning. Is that okay?
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; How about shut down a minute ago? But
[2:10:49] here we go. Listen. And he that spared
[2:10:51] not his own son, but delivered us him up
[2:10:53] for us all, how shall he not with him
[2:10:56] also freely give us all things. Amen.
[2:10:59] And who shall lay anything to the charge
[2:11:01] of God's elect? It's God that justifyth.
[2:11:04] How many like that? People might judge
[2:11:06] you. People might want to condemn you,
[2:11:08] but all I can say is shut up. God is the
[2:11:10] one justifies me. He is the one that
[2:11:12] died for me, not you. You're not my
[2:11:15] justifier. So shut up, devil.
[2:11:19] Who is he that condemnth? It's God that
[2:11:22] justified.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Woo! Hallelujah. How many is glad that
[2:11:27] your sins are gone
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; in the sea of God's forgetfulness?
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Folks, I'm here to tell you if you was
[2:11:33] on the day of judgment on day, if there
[2:11:35] was such a thing of the devil come up
[2:11:36] and say, "Well, God, he did so and so
[2:11:38] and so." He'd look on that book and say,
[2:11:40] "I'm sorry, but there's nothing but
[2:11:41] blood there." Amen. And it has a pardon
[2:11:44] on it. There's nothing there.
[2:11:47] Remember
[2:11:50] brother Brandham when he went in Ohio in
[2:11:52] that restaurant and that woman was there
[2:11:55] with purple hair and everything else 70
[2:11:56] years old flab hanging down ill fame
[2:11:58] dressed with a couple of men and
[2:12:00] everything else he was saying God my
[2:12:02] daughters are going to have to grow up
[2:12:03] why don't you just wipe that thing off
[2:12:05] the earth how can you stand and God got
[2:12:07] a hold of him said where would you be if
[2:12:09] it wasn't for my grace isn't that right
[2:12:11] amen he showed him all of his sins and
[2:12:13] how did they come up and they bumper
[2:12:15] they bumper they bumper he says you mean
[2:12:16] I did that You mean I caused you that
[2:12:18] pain every time? Yeah, you did. And then
[2:12:20] he wrote, Amen. reaching his side and he
[2:12:22] write on his book, Pardon. Amen. I
[2:12:25] pardoned you, but you want to condemn
[2:12:26] them.
[2:12:29] How many know those sinners out there,
[2:12:30] they need salvation? They need grace.
[2:12:32] Those people with pink hair, blue hair,
[2:12:34] whatever it is, they need the mercy of
[2:12:36] Almighty God.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. They do.
[2:12:44] Brother Tommy, me and you'd probably
[2:12:45] look like freaks today if God left us
[2:12:47] out there.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; You'd say, "Oh, you'd never do that.
[2:12:53] You'd never You don't know what you'd do
[2:12:55] if you're under control of the devil."
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Hello. I thank God for his mercy and for
[2:13:00] his grace, folks.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that power in his
[2:13:07] means so much.
[2:13:09] His grace, his mercy, his forgiveness.
[2:13:14] You know how often, brother Benam in his
[2:13:16] prayers says, "God, forgive us of our
[2:13:17] wrongs and our failures." The prophet of
[2:13:20] God, it should be a habit of all of us.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I go to bed at night, God, if
[2:13:25] I've done anything wrong today, please
[2:13:27] forgive me, Lord Jesus.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have no guarantee of
[2:13:30] waking up. I close my eyes and I says, I
[2:13:33] could wake up over there and look down
[2:13:35] on my body and say, "I'm I'm gone." You
[2:13:37] don't know. You ain't got no guarantee.
[2:13:39] But you got this one guarantee if you're
[2:13:41] in Christ. Amen. You ain't got a
[2:13:43] problem. You ain't got no worry. You
[2:13:45] don't sin like butter said, "Do I got to
[2:13:46] go back in that body?" No, he didn't
[2:13:49] want to. Amen.
[2:13:52] Amen. The grace of almighty God. Amen.
[2:13:55] Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ
[2:13:57] that died. Yay. Rather that is risen
[2:13:59] again and at the right hand of God. And
[2:14:01] who shall separate us from the love of
[2:14:03] God? Tribulation, distress, persecution,
[2:14:05] famine, nakedness, nothing. How many
[2:14:07] believe in God's word? He said it won't
[2:14:09] come back for it. He says, "Nothing's
[2:14:11] going to separate us from the love of
[2:14:13] God."
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Nothing. God ought to give us joy.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "All the Father has
[2:14:19] given me will come and and I will lose
[2:14:23] none of them. And no man can pluck them
[2:14:25] out of my hand."
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; If you're his, like brother Bam says, if
[2:14:29] you're saved,
[2:14:31] you have this one assurance. You can
[2:14:33] rest assured
[2:14:35] that you are anchored. Your destination,
[2:14:38] your eternal destination is anchored in
[2:14:40] God. You don't have to be afraid.
[2:14:44] Amen.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God is good.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:57] Last, last scripture.
[2:15:00] Amen.
[2:15:03] I'll repeat this one here. The Lord is
[2:15:07] great and greatly to be praised.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is to be feared above all gods.
[2:15:15] Amen.
[2:15:17] Praise ye the Lord. 148 of Psalms.
[2:15:21] Praise ye the Lord from the heavens.
[2:15:24] Praise him in the heights. Praise ye him
[2:15:27] all his angels. Outsty angels. Did you
[2:15:31] hear that?
[2:15:33] You probably couldn't hear for the
[2:15:34] flapping and give you wings and you you
[2:15:37] praising him. What are you talking about
[2:15:38] preacher down there? This is what I do.
[2:15:41] I do it all the time. They pray. How
[2:15:43] many knows they're there all the time?
[2:15:46] Saraphims and so forth around him. Holy,
[2:15:49] holy, holy, holy day and night. Holy,
[2:15:53] holy, holy is the Lord. That's our great
[2:15:56] God.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:01] Praise ye him all his hosts. Praise him
[2:16:04] son. Praise him moon. Praise him ye
[2:16:06] stars of light. Praise him in the
[2:16:08] heavens of heavens. Ye waters that be
[2:16:10] above the heavens. Let them praise the
[2:16:12] name of the Lord. For he commanded and
[2:16:14] they were. How many believe that he said
[2:16:18] it? He spoke you into existence. That's
[2:16:21] why he chose you.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; So praise him. Say thank you Lord.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; It gives us a thankfulness.
[2:16:29] Give thanks with a grateful heart.
[2:16:31] People are so unthankful.
[2:16:36] Oh, let's give thanks to him.
[2:16:39] Revelations 19:6.
[2:16:41] All right.
[2:16:43] He has established them forever and
[2:16:45] ever. He hath made a decree which shall
[2:16:47] not p pass. Praise the Lord from the
[2:16:50] earth. Ye dragons and deeps, fire, hail,
[2:16:53] smoke, vapor, stormy wind, fulfilling
[2:16:55] his words. Mountains and hills, fruitful
[2:16:58] trees and cedars, beasts and all cattle.
[2:17:01] Woo!
[2:17:07] That's right, blackberry. That's right,
[2:17:10] strudles.
[2:17:12] Praise the Lord.
[2:17:15] Amen.
[2:17:18] That's our cow's names, just in case
[2:17:20] you're going
[2:17:22] the world's blackberry strudles.
[2:17:25] That's right. When Donna named our cows,
[2:17:27] it was a dessert.
[2:17:31] Dessert. I think that's what it was. If
[2:17:34] I remember right,
[2:17:36] she thought it's blackberry and these
[2:17:38] strudles and stuff. Amen. That's right.
[2:17:41] How many believe that? Didn't brother
[2:17:43] said the birds, they praise the Lord
[2:17:45] when they get up in the morning.
[2:17:49] That's right. They praise him.
[2:17:52] We get up and Oh,
[2:17:55] another day. My gracious.
[2:17:58] It's Monday,
[2:18:00] Tuesday.
[2:18:02] That's right.
[2:18:05] I know. Don't do it cuz you sleep long.
[2:18:06] I mean, I sleep longer than you do. So,
[2:18:08] when you get up at 4:00, don't go.
[2:18:10] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:13] She does. I guess I'll bear with it.
[2:18:15] Maybe I'll join in with her.
[2:18:17] We're just having a good old jubilee.
[2:18:20] But how many believes that ought to be
[2:18:22] in our hearts? A heart of worship. A
[2:18:25] heart of praise. I mean worship him. The
[2:18:28] fruit of our lips giving praise to his
[2:18:31] name.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those people out there and there's
[2:18:39] a rock and roll songs. I'm living for
[2:18:41] giving the devil his due. I want you to
[2:18:44] know I'm living for giving God his due.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil got his due. He'll burn
[2:18:50] in a lake of fire and people that serve
[2:18:53] him, they'll get their due. And it ain't
[2:18:54] going to be a good thing.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:18:59] But how glorious it is to give God the
[2:19:02] glory and honor that's due to his name.
[2:19:04] Respect. Accept what he's done. That's
[2:19:07] all he asks. Accept the pardon that I
[2:19:09] gave you. Go into the highways and the
[2:19:12] hedges, brother Tommy. Go out there,
[2:19:14] compel them. Tell them I forgave them.
[2:19:16] Come and accept them. Come and die. the
[2:19:18] master calleth,
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; but they just would not. I reached out
[2:19:23] my hand. I stretched out my hand of
[2:19:25] mercy, but you would not.
[2:19:27] People don't want to. They won't.
[2:19:31] Why do you think that you ought to be
[2:19:32] that happy or more happy because God put
[2:19:35] something in your heart?
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; I mean, God put that in your heart.
[2:19:39] That's the mercy and grace of almighty
[2:19:41] God.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; He puts a receiver down in here. He put
[2:19:46] something in there for you to want to. I
[2:19:50] mean, know that's not you. You didn't do
[2:19:52] it. God did it. He put it in there.
[2:19:54] Amen. The receiver, as many as received
[2:19:57] him, to them gave he the power to become
[2:19:59] sons of God. In other words, those who
[2:20:01] had a receiver to accept it.
[2:20:05] Praise be to God.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:16] Jesus
[2:20:18] paid it all.
[2:20:20] He paid the ultimate price.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Why don't you pay the ultimate price and
[2:20:25] say, "God, this morning I want to die to
[2:20:28] completely to myself."
[2:20:31] Stand with me. Musicians, if you'll
[2:20:33] come.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Sister Janette.
[2:21:04] Who?
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; My niece.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Your niece. Should have her microphone.
[2:21:11] Let me get you a microphone, Sister
[2:21:13] Janette. Okay, give it a just a second.
[2:21:16] I don't want to miss it, and I want
[2:21:17] everybody to hear it. Okay.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; No, just tell us what you got.
[2:21:25] Saring God's not a sacrifice. Not to me.
[2:21:28] It's a privilege.
[2:21:29] I got a text and within the last two
[2:21:32] hours, my niece's husband, she's got MS,
[2:21:36] but he was outside working or something
[2:21:38] and he collapsed, but he didn't make it.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; No, none of us know from one day to the
[2:21:45] next when our next time is. I've been
[2:21:48] sitting here for the last two years
[2:21:50] expecting and I'm praising God with
[2:21:52] every breath I take.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes it's really hard to
[2:21:56] do.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But then it's the little things
[2:21:59] that we do not appreciate.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; And you know this morning I have to be
[2:22:05] with you. I thank God for every pain I
[2:22:08] got. For fact it knows that I'm still
[2:22:09] here and I can praise my God. But this
[2:22:13] family needs prayer bad. If they're
[2:22:16] anything like what I've known that
[2:22:17] they've grown up to be. Hey, I'm
[2:22:20] blessed. That's all I can say. I'm
[2:22:22] blessed. But they need all the prayer
[2:22:25] that anybody can give them.
[2:22:28] So, but and I'd appreciate it.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Sister. We're going to
[2:22:33] believe for you, sister. Hope you live
[2:22:36] long. Amen. And
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; And we'll pray for that family.
[2:22:44] Let's pray for that family, shall we?
[2:22:47] Lord Jesus, father, sister Janette's
[2:22:50] niec's husband. Lord Jesus,
[2:22:54] gone gone to eternity in the next last
[2:22:57] few hours. Lord,
[2:22:59] Father, just in the time perhaps that
[2:23:01] we've sat here,
[2:23:03] Lord Jesus, we certainly understand,
[2:23:05] God, that we each one don't know when
[2:23:08] our number is going to be pulled from
[2:23:11] the rack, so to speak, when we're going
[2:23:12] to get to go over there, Lord. But we
[2:23:15] ask God for that family just now that
[2:23:17] you'll bring comfort, Lord Jesus. And I
[2:23:18] don't know whether what their that man's
[2:23:20] spiritual condition was, but we pray for
[2:23:23] those Lord Jesus that are around him or
[2:23:25] her husband hurt his wife. Lord, we pray
[2:23:29] God that Lord, if she's not right and
[2:23:31] she's still here, Father, she still has
[2:23:33] a chance to be with you and to get with
[2:23:35] you and have her sins covered. We ask
[2:23:38] for her salvation and for her saving,
[2:23:41] Lord Jesus, just now bless that family
[2:23:44] and comfort them and be with them in a
[2:23:46] special way. Lord, once again, we ask
[2:23:49] God for Bobby and Lois and Aaron. Lord,
[2:23:52] we ask God that you just bring Aaron,
[2:23:54] Lord, around, Lord Jesus, and fill him
[2:23:56] with your Holy Spirit, Father. He needs
[2:23:58] you, God. Lord, where life is not worth
[2:24:03] living without you, God. And Lord, and
[2:24:06] whatever it is, God, that you've allowed
[2:24:07] to happen, we ask, God, that it'll bring
[2:24:09] him closer to you. And father that
[2:24:12] you'll heal him spiritually and then
[2:24:14] physically also Lord that you'll touch
[2:24:17] him Lord Jesus touch that whole family
[2:24:19] Lord we ask God in Jesus name Lord for
[2:24:23] this blessing in Jesus name amen and
[2:24:27] amen
[2:24:29] only
[2:24:32] believe
[2:24:35] Only
[2:24:37] Billy.

[2:24:47] All things are possible.
[2:24:53] Only

[2:25:58] All things are possible.
[2:26:04] Lord, I
[2:26:06] receive.
[2:26:09] Can I just do something that I felt a
[2:26:12] change in the atmosphere or just feel
[2:26:16] pulled this way rather than having a
[2:26:18] worship song service perhaps, but just a
[2:26:22] rededication. And I know it's not Easter
[2:26:24] and so forth, but everybody that just
[2:26:27] wants to give their life aresh to him
[2:26:28] and say, "God, I want to give you my
[2:26:30] life. Aresh, want to step out and come
[2:26:32] up to the altar and say, "Lord Jesus, I
[2:26:34] want to die to myself. I want to I want
[2:26:37] to give you myself completely, Lord. I'm
[2:26:40] counting the cost this morning, Lord.
[2:26:42] And I'm willing to pay whatever price,
[2:26:45] the complete price, Lord. Don't let me
[2:26:47] sherk on my on paying, Lord. not just
[2:26:51] give you partially me or a little bit of
[2:26:53] me or Lord, but I want to give you all
[2:26:55] of me this morning, Lord. Father, this
[2:26:58] is our heart's desire here at the
[2:26:59] church, Lord, and me as the pastor, God.
[2:27:02] Father, if there's any area, Lord Jesus,
[2:27:04] that's not dead yet, Lord. Show me. I
[2:27:07] will repent and I will give it to you,
[2:27:08] Lord. That's the heart of the people
[2:27:11] that's coming up right now. Coming to
[2:27:13] you, Lord, standing, Father. You see
[2:27:16] every heart. You see the motive of every
[2:27:19] heart, Lord, this morning. And we're all
[2:27:21] here saying, "Lord Jesus, we give you
[2:27:23] our self this morning. We bring oursel
[2:27:26] to the altar because that's what you
[2:27:27] want. Lord, we so many times ask you for
[2:27:31] this. Can you do that for me and this
[2:27:33] for me, but Lord, we do this for you.
[2:27:35] What do we ever You cared now. Lord,
[2:27:38] help us. We care also. We love you,
[2:27:40] Father. We appreciate what you've done,
[2:27:43] God. And we pray, Lord Jesus, that
[2:27:45] you'll take every heart, Lord. And
[2:27:47] Father, this coming week for everybody
[2:27:50] that's come out of their seats, Lord,
[2:27:52] and come up and said, "God, I'm willing
[2:27:54] to pay the price, Lord. Whatever it
[2:27:57] takes, take more of myself away. And
[2:27:59] where I'm still in there, God, take it
[2:28:01] away. Help me, like Paul said, to die
[2:28:03] daily. Don't let my flesh rise up and
[2:28:06] take the preeminence. Let your word, let
[2:28:08] the passion of my heart for you take the
[2:28:10] preeminence."
[2:28:12] And Lord, will let us not go out and be
[2:28:15] the same as we were this last week.
[2:28:18] Father, may we go out a changed people,
[2:28:22] Lord, more dedicated to you, Lord, more
[2:28:25] sensitive to your spirit, to be able to
[2:28:28] hear your voice in our lives in a much
[2:28:30] louder way, Lord,
[2:28:32] in every little thing that we do and
[2:28:34] say, Father. And help us that every deed
[2:28:37] that we would do would be pleasing to
[2:28:39] you, Lord. that it would be a positive
[2:28:41] thing that we would give a cup of water
[2:28:44] not offend somebody but Lord let us do
[2:28:46] the right thing father we ask God that
[2:28:49] as you see these altars this altar
[2:28:51] filled with your children Lord Jesus you
[2:28:54] said your word would not go void Lord
[2:28:56] and this morning it has not went forth
[2:28:59] void but Lord I believe it is fallen on
[2:29:02] each heart this morning Lord and we
[2:29:03] resurend rededicate ourselves aresh to a
[2:29:07] walk with you Lord and I pray every man
[2:29:09] woman and child, God, that you would
[2:29:11] give him that closer walk with you.
[2:29:14] Father, for one of these days, we're
[2:29:16] going to walk and we're not going to be
[2:29:18] because we'll have this testimony that
[2:29:20] we please you. We ask this in Jesus name
[2:29:25] as we give you our hearts aresh. Amen.
[2:29:28] And amen.
[2:29:30] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Raise your
[2:29:33] hands. Say, "Thank you, Lord. I surren I
[2:29:34] surrender all to you, Lord. I surrender.
[2:29:37] We surrender all to you, Lord. Take our
[2:29:40] life, mold us and shape us, Lord Jesus.
[2:29:43] Have us ready for the time that lays
[2:29:45] ahead because we know by the signs of
[2:29:47] the time. It could happen before
[2:29:49] tonight. It could happen any time, Lord.
[2:29:52] We want to be ready. We do not want to
[2:29:54] fall into the category where the servant
[2:29:57] said, "My Lord delayeth his coming. Oh,
[2:29:59] it'll still be a few more years and not
[2:30:01] be ready." God, we don't want to. Don't
[2:30:03] let one person in here be in that
[2:30:04] category, but let us be in the category
[2:30:07] of those who are ready and waiting for
[2:30:10] your coming, looking for his coming. Not
[2:30:12] as a thief in the night, but Lord, we're
[2:30:14] watching, Lord. We're that they will not
[2:30:16] take us unaware, Lord, but we'll be
[2:30:18] aware of it. Father, have us ready for
[2:30:20] that time, we ask in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:30:25] And amen. God bless you. You can be
[2:30:26] seated again. I'll turn the service over
[2:30:28] to brother Joshua.
[2:30:56] You do
[2:30:58] thy will,
[2:31:01] oh Lord,
[2:31:05] I want to do
[2:31:08] thy will,
[2:31:11] oh Lord,
[2:31:17] take me,
[2:31:20] break me,
[2:31:22] mold
[2:31:24] me, and make me. I want to do
[2:31:30] thy will,

[2:31:40] thy will,
[2:31:43] oh Lord.

[2:31:50] thy will,
[2:31:53] oh Lord.
[2:31:58] Oh, take me
[2:32:02] and break me,
[2:32:04] mold
[2:32:06] me, and make me. I want to do
[2:32:12] thy will,

[2:32:22] And touching Jesus
[2:32:26] is all that really matterers.
[2:32:34] And your life will never be
[2:32:39] the same.

[2:33:31] one way
[2:33:33] to touch him.
[2:33:37] It's just believe
[2:33:40] when you call on his name. One more
[2:33:45] time. Oh, now touching Jesus
[2:33:51] is all that really matterers.
[2:33:58] And then your life will never be
[2:34:04] the same.

[2:34:13] one way to touch him.
[2:34:20] Just believe
[2:34:23] when you call on
[2:34:26] his name.
[2:34:30] Amen. I am redeemed. Bought with a
[2:34:32] price.
[2:34:33] I am
[2:34:36] redeemed.
[2:34:38] I've been bought away
[2:34:41] the price.
[2:34:44] And Jesus
[2:34:46] has changed my whole life.

[2:34:59] just who I am,

[2:35:07] I am redeemed.
[2:35:14] And where there was hate,
[2:35:19] love now
[2:35:21] abides.
[2:35:24] And where there
[2:35:26] was confusion,
[2:35:28] peace now reigns.
[2:35:34] I'm walking
[2:35:36] with Jesus.
[2:35:39] I'm a child of the king
[2:35:43] and it's all because
[2:35:47] I am redeemed.
[2:35:53] Oh, I am redeemed.
[2:35:58] I've been bought with a price
[2:36:03] for Jesus
[2:36:06] has changed my whole life.
[2:36:13] If anybody
[2:36:16] asks you
[2:36:19] just who I am,
[2:36:24] tell them

[2:36:43] All tell love his goodness
[2:36:47] to me.

[2:36:55] my pardon
[2:36:57] with his own preious
[2:37:00] blood.
[2:37:02] And from sin
[2:37:05] I've been set free.
[2:37:11] Oh, I am redeemed.
[2:37:16] I'm bought away
[2:37:19] the price.
[2:37:22] Jesus
[2:37:24] has changed my whole life.
[2:37:31] And if anybody
[2:37:34] asks you

[2:37:56] why I'm happy, so I'll just tell you
[2:37:58] why. As you're dismissed this morning,
[2:38:01] you ask me why I'm happy, so I'll just
[2:38:06] tell you why. Because
[2:38:11] all my sins are gone.
