========================================

but i'll jump around but this is paul in first corinthians talking about his experience with jesus christ and you know in churches all over the world they'll be reading from from john they'll be reading from luke you know and even mark or and reading from isaiah 53 but i just thought i'd read out of uh corinthians just like brother branham was prophet to us in this last age paul was the prophet to the gentile church that we all are a part of this morning i'll try to jump around you'll have to forgive me if i don't and paul said here in the first verse of the 15th chapter of corinthians i'm all over brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preach unto you which you also have received and wherein you stand but by which also you are saved if you keep in memory what i have preached on to you unless you have believed in vain you know you know preach teachers could take that very verse and talk about the message every hour that we're holding to a truth that's been revealed to us in the age that we're in for i delivered unto you first of all which i also received how christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that's the whole purpose of easter this morning and he goes on to say that he was buried and he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of cepis and the twelve and after he was seen above 500 brother and of one of whom the greater part remain unto us present but some have fallen asleep so paul is talking about how he's some of them people are still alive today and that that he was seen of james and all the apostles the last he was all seen at last of all he was seen of me also was one born out of due time for i am the last of the apostles i am not me to be called an apostle because i have persecuted the church of god and that goes back to what i was saying paul's experience with jesus christ this morning was by revelation where god reveals himself to paul and we all know you can go back to acts in ninth chapter and you can read how jesus christ revealed himself to paul are we all like paul you know we all have our own relationship with jesus christ this morning he reaches people in different ways and different walks of life but it's still the same really it has to be the same where god comes into the heart of that individual he goes on to say here but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which he was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me and everyone here this morning we all stand very simply in the grace of god this morning none of us can live without god's grace this morning and he goes on therefore whether or not where i or they as we preach so you believed now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead house well i'll stop there he's i'll jump over here to about the 20 about the 19th verse here if in his life only we have hope incred in this life only we have hope in christ we are all men most miserable but now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that sleep from since by mankind death by man also man also came the resurrection of dead for as in adam all died even so in christ all shall be made alive but every man is in his own order christ the first fruits afterwards they that are christ after is coming you know i'll stop there i don't want to take a lot of time this morning but i was just thinking this morning this easter morning that god has all given us a great gift this morning and that's himself and uh if you've got that gift that god has revealed himself in your heart this morning and in your life you can count yourself one of the blessed this morning that god has thought enough of you in this age to reveal himself to you and to show you a path that you need to walk this morning brother david hey man you love him this morning with all of your heart amen god is so good this morning and let's stay in this morning if we could and amen sing that little course this morning if we could he's alive and well living in me to tell this morning amen the world that he's the same you believe he's alive and well

you wouldn't have the peace that you have your whole world would be chaos amen amen so we thank god for wonderful wonderful the resurrection of jesus christ amen i believe the prophet god said that he was the great grandest of all days amen however we do know there's another grandest of all days coming amen amen so if you will stand with me and we'll just try to share a little bit something i feel the lord's laid on my heart this morning for the easter message this morning god bless you brother gary good to see you amen let's bow our heads this morning lord jesus we come before you lord and we're so grateful for this morning lord for you rose on easter morning lord jesus to vindicate and to prove and to show that everything that you had said while he was here on earth was true lord now we can believe it now we can know without a shadow of a doubt father every word that you've spoken father because you proved it when you rose from the dead and we're so grateful this morning to be able to believe it to be able to have a heart and a mind to be able to receive everything that you have said father we ask lord this morning the blessing upon the word the opening of the word the meditation of my heart and that which we feel you've laid upon the heart to minister this morning may we go from here closer to you than what we came lord a better people than when we have came in those doors lord and we just ask god you'd help me just to get out of the way lord that you might speak to your people once again so that we could say the same as they did on the road of emmaus lord did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way because we believe you're the same yesterday today and forever in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen turn your bibles if you will amen we will go to the book of mark i want to read two scriptures to begin with and it's kind of a different type of thought i guess but we do want to uh speak on what east really means is that okay amen and i want to title this i believe i believe amen amen how many believers this morning i believe amen praise be to god amen because if you didn't you'd be damned you'd be doomed amen it'd be a sad day if you didn't believe and that's grace i believe that's grace amen it was grace that taught my heart to fear amen amen in mark and we'll begin with we'll skip on down a little bit right to verse 9. write to verse 9 chapter 16 of mark now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not after that he appeared in another form unto the two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it to the residue neither believed they them afterwards he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at me and afraid them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen amen let me just say this can you imagine that was for that they think about how that jesus came and proved himself that he's alive in this generation and the people still don't believe it the world church world wouldn't believe it even though he proved it and you say thomas was bad thomas wasn't bad he believed when he's all people can see it they still don't believe and i want to say this that's why the world's in the shape it is is because the church world amen the ocean came in eve the waves came in they let it in amen they chose a barabbas rather than jesus my my my and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned then these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover suddenly after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat at the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen of course we see this happening amen after the book of acts amen in mark 9 mark 9 i believe it is verse 17 mark 9 and 17. and one of the multitude answered and said master i have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and who wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him he foameth and gnashes with his teeth and pineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not and he answered him and said o faithless generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him [Music] and when he saw him straight with his spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it since this came on him upon him and he said of a child and oftentimes it has cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do anything he have compassion on us and help us and jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth amen praise the lord that we're going to focus on that word believe this morning is that okay amen because it's a very important word and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord this is my title i believe i believe amen help thou mind unbelief and when jesus saw the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying thou diamond death spirit i charge she come out of him and after and enter no more into him and the spirit cried and read him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead in as much as the man he said he is dead but just jesus took him by the hand and he lifted him up and he arose amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen god bless you this morning first i'd like to say this morning that we're grateful and i want to talk a little bit before we get perhaps a little bit more about in the in the in the area of i believe amen we want to first talk about what easter means it does not mean amen uh you know that we just go out there and have a easter bunny and a or a egg hunt and things like that you know the prophet of god called all of that foolishness isn't that right because ain't no rabbit or no chicken got nothing to do with no easter amen no resurrection but people have taken and making something else about it but we realized that easter and what easter was all about was god coming down isn't that right amen this morning the very resurrection friday night i guess it had been friday he was uh he was killed and he was he was uh crucified and killed and so forth and put in a tomb and there he lay for about you know until the third day friday saturday and within those 72 hours or within the three days we know that he rose again but you know he was doing something and he one place he said thomas or or to this disciples he says you know because they didn't want him to leave i mean they wanted jesus to stay they wanted him to be the king and and all the and i can't imagine i don't know just what in the world it was that the disciples had in their mind that was going to happen with the ministry of jesus right and where are they going to go with this right what's going to happen with this because he talked about going away he talked about being crucified amen and thomas says you know not thomas but peter says no that's never going to happen you know you know we don't want that to happen we want to be you know betrayed in the sinful hands of into the sinful hands of man and so forth and you know but even jesus rebuked him for that and he says you know it's expedient [Music] it is necessary that i go away because if i don't go away the comfort can't come amen praise the lord when i thought about that not just a comforter but salvation couldn't come forgiveness couldn't come peace couldn't come grace couldn't come if he doesn't go away he doesn't pay the price amen praise the lord i want to read the scripture this morning amen not a scripture but a quote that the prophet of god made that you know kind of took me off of on my message that i thought about listen so he says here now he says i've often thought the prophet says i've often thought what would i do if i had two drops of the blood of your son in a glass or a charger in my hand the literal drops of the blood from calvary how my tears would run down my cheeks as i held it knowing that i had in my hands the blood of jesus christ any charger amen i'm because what is it you think about that because i know it was the blood i know it was the blood amen amen christ our redeemers died on the cross amen we know that everything that blood had forgiveness power that healing power it was god's own blood and he thought there would be such a treasure to have it he says but listen in a charger but tonight in thy sight according to the scripture i believe that it's greater for i hold the purchase of your blood your children amen so how many know that it was more what he had bought what he bought with what he did was greater to him than what he had had to spend to get it so you think about this morning i just want to focus on that thinking about what we have what that blood part how many believe that when he shed that blood when they put that spear in his side and that blood came out that was the purchasing power that was the buying power god was buying something he was paying for something he used his blood to pay for something how many know we were all adam the first adam sold us all into the devil's pawn shop and the devil had rights on you he had rights on you in other words and he had we had uh uh you know we had coming to a nature by our first birth and so forth amen that we could never get away from that nature he had a right on your nature that's why all through the old testament they could kill all the lambs and the sheep and the goats they could kill all they wanted to it would never change their nature and when he paid that price it was exceeding it was necessary that he goes because if he didn't go you could never have a nature church [Applause] think about it and the devil would always have rights you would go out the next day and do the same thing again no matter how much you believed how much you tried they would have to come back the next year make another sacrifice for the same things over and over again but when he paid that remember he paid for sin he paid for unbelief he paid for the price so that you could be free from it you could have a divine nature this morning and the devil doesn't have any rights with you anymore it was necessary that it goes away he paid for your fellowship he paid for your redemption remember in the book of revelations the fifth chapter he was the redeemer and islam was the redeemer to bring us back to god again back to what fellowship with god how many faithful to have fellowship with god what a privilege and not have to be in the devil's pawn shop anymore oh he purchased our salvation on calvary's tree he bought it how many knows when he's dropped when his blood dropped on the earth he paid for this very earth again is his your earth is his your body's his he paid for it all he just hasn't claimed it yet i'm he's looking for that claim i'm waiting for that claim to be made now in our spirits and in our souls we have already been redeemed to god but these bodies they're still carnal we're groaning we're still waiting for this to be redeemed oh but he hated one thing he did that's what easter means it means he pawned us brought us back out of the pawn shop he took away the devil's power to hold you i was listening yesterday he says jesus went down on saturday night he went down to the pit of hell and the devil's doorstep and he come in there and the devil says you know he says i finally got you i couldn't get you in abel i couldn't get you in all the prophets i killed but i finally got he says i want you to know my blood is fresh on calvary i'm the urgent born son of god and i have paid the price and you give me the keys of hell and you give me the keys of death so to speak he went up there and grabbed him by the neck and pushed him up against the wall grabbed the excuse off the side all right they belong to me now isn't that right and he grabbed him and gave him a good kick into the jail cell and slammed the door he let kept him and he got them glory aren't you glad for that that he let captivity captive and he gave gifts to you and i and now we don't have to fear death hell the grave you gotta fear no more you don't have to fear dying you don't have to fear any of that death people go gladly people go with a smile on their face now paul he says you know death where is your sting oh grave where is your victory amen praise be to god aren't you glad for that took the keys off of him locked him up took the key to come back up in the come up and he's got that now we know the keys of the kingdom were given to peter isn't that right he unlocked the keys that the kingdom of heaven on and on the day of pentecost in the book of acts repent every one of you praise be to god another thing he did another thing he was doing while he was here as the prophet of god said you know that every great disease that [Music] we have you know many different diseases that we've had that people and uh just this last one just to talk about covet and and so forth and how that they would work at what was it called speed to try to come up with an antidote anyway it was trump's call this lightning speed let's get it up let's find one quick right well maybe they should have taken more time because i ain't got a whole lot of confidence in what's going on here right but anyway you know it's but anyways just penicillin we know that penicillin and those diseases before different diseases that they actually amen got an antidote for and before they would try it on on a human they tried on a guinea pig they tried on animals and if it worked on them then have a human trial and guess what if it worked on a human it was good to go that's what christ was doing he was coming and giving us an antidote to the sickness of unbelief that we had the sickness of our nature huh all of that he come and he come and he tried it and he proved it you know right and he took that medicine amen and he went to the grave destroyed his temple and in three days i'll raise it up again now we've got something that we know that when we take this it's guaranteed to raise you up again aren't you glad what is what is the recipe what is the ingredient jesus said to mary she he said i am the resurrection i am the life you know right so if you've got christ this morning what have you got you've got the resurrection you already have the resurrection on the inside of you that's the pride of prophet and god said don't let them throw god dirty in your face not my way of pertinent don't you let don't you go down in the grave don't you go in the grave without the holy ghost or you ain't got no guarantee of coming up but as sure as you go down with the holy ghost and he's guaranteed to raise you up again you will come forth if the same spirit that was in christ that raised christ from the dead well in your mortal body it'll also quicken your moral body praise be to god aren't you thankful for that i'm thankful for easter folks means a lot to us and in the world that we're living in think about it how many knows this world is truly falling apart and you and i are feeling the pressure of it amen probably god says you can feel that darkness coming down he said that in 65 i wonder if he wasn't prophesying of today of how that you can just feel that pressure coming i'm feeling it i feel that pressure of darkness coming down can i say something it's making people do what they don't normally would want to do it's making them do things they don't even really want to do i mean that's why it's so important to have the holy ghost that's the only thing that will give you power over not doing things that you do your flesh desires to do it's the power of the holy ghost we can't never say enough amen that the necessity of having the baptism in the holy ghost because it's the only thing and that's what he christ died for amen because he said if i don't go away the comforter we know that's what the holy ghost he can't come if i don't go and i pay this price it's very expedient that it happens praise the lord oh my what was he doing on easter he had was becoming us wasn't he he became us he became a mortal man the bible says he became sin he became sin so that you could become god's righteousness so that you could be as righteous as god is right 40 i'm telling you what that's a big statement huh isn't that a big statement that you and i could be as righteous as god is righteous because if you try to present yourself to god in any of your own righteousness it's a bunch of dirty rags but you got to come and say god i present you amen i come to not claim your righteousness the righteousness that is in christ jesus amen through the through the cross they didn't they captured jesus they caught jesus and took him to the courts and so forth he became a captive so that you could be free [Applause] [Music] how many free people do we have think about it truly free free from unbeliefs free from sin that's what he come to do he became poor didn't even have a lay place to lay his head so that you could become one rich in god [Applause] amen you could have the very faith that god had to create the earth with genesis 1 and god created heavens and earth we know by faith we understand the world it was framed by god's old faith he said let it be done and he wellness that's the kind of faith you have when you have a need when you desire something don't just beg the devil to give it to you no you say i believe it it's mine huh have god's faith the riches of his faith the riches of his love [Music] oh my so he died so that you might live how many is alive remember he says we who were once dead in sins and trespasses i'll have been quickened by the power of god amen so look alive don't look dead look alive let's look alive [Applause] amen aren't you glad to live amen praise the lord he was weary he was tired so why so that you could rest am right he became weary so that you could rest amen another thing we're to be rich with how many knows that there is absolutely not enough money or anything you could ever do to merit forgiveness of your sins i don't care how many cobbles on streets they crawl i don't care how many lashes they put on their back or how far they crawl or what kind of pain they inflict upon themselves they could never buy but even enough for one of their sins to be forgiven but the true riches was in being able to be forgiven when you make a mistake yesterday after that year you have the ability to go to god and be forgiven that's invaluable because without forgiveness you have no faith you have no peace there is no peace outside of forgiveness amen praise be to god so you think about that and think about it there's only one way there's only one thing there's only two worlds that you can live on only two worlds two atmospheres and think about this and this is why my heart is sad for the world today because i was thinking about this i thought because let's just put it this way god made a mistake let's just put a god god made a mistake and he put into contract and he said he didn't say just a certain group a certain nation a certain race but he put it in there and he says whosoever will whosoever believeth in him shall not perish [Music] oops huh we know that it wasn't a mistake but that's awful big i mean that is really big i wish the world could hear that is so big until everybody that comes to judgment is going to have to face john 3 16. god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting right i didn't put race i didn't put creative color in there i gave it to everybody what would this world be like if everybody would truly believe huh truly believe it would be a different world how do you know brother brother better perish because my whole world was changed drinking and crowsing and dope and adultery and everything else in the book all went by the wayside folks waking up of a morning completely empty and miserable on the inside yeah you cater to the flesh and the lust of the flesh you can do that and that'll give you pleasure but i'm here to tell you it doesn't do anything for your spirit or your soul it completely will leave you empty and dry not even wanting to live it really doesn't pay [Applause] can i say something it's really not worth it it's really not worth it to believe oh that man he had he had a lunatic son and he wanted him healed and god says if you believe if you'll believe anything is possible evening light tab black like i'm here to tell you something then if you can believe anything is possible [Applause] all things are possible to them that believe the book of matthew when it tells the story you know and when they ask why they why they couldn't uh heal him and so forth he says you know it was because of your lack of faith that you could this couldn't happen because he said if you had the faith of a grain of monster cheat you would say to this mountain be moved and plucked into the sea and it would happen and then if i remember right he said after that he says for he said with you all things are possible nothing shall be impossible if you can believe i'm so glad that god changed my heart he changed my soul he saved my soul because there was something down in there to believe how many knows that's what's great and god about being happy about is the fact that god placed that something in your heart to believe with it ought to make us happy to know that you got a believer in there to him that hath to him shall be given to him that hath not from him shall be taken even what he does has be glad yes you're in the category of him that hath i do in the category this morning unto him that hath shall be given more he became sorrowful so that you could have joy unspeakable he sat on the hill and wept so that you could have joy unspeakable and full of glory that's what easter is all about amen paul said if you believe with all of your heart that christ died and that he rose again if thou shall believe with all thy heart thou shalt be saved how many believes that we believe the story of easter now there's a big difference between you saying you believe and you believe it because there's a lot that say they believe easter a lot of people say they believe the resurrection of christ but do they really do they really no they don't really because if you really believe it's going to happen if you come the right way to god and you believe in him he is going to forgive you for your sins the bible says their ears have been closed their hearts have their clothes and so forth they won't hear he says because if they did god would have to heal him he would have to heal him if they truly believed but they closed their eyes the whole world it all lays within and that's the problem this is what my message is this morning easter is the greatest thing ever but it doesn't do one bit of good to the multitude of the people out there not one benefit that they reap from it why [Music] because they believe not [Music] how many knows that is the sin that'll send them to hell all the adultery all the smoke and drinking all of that that's not what god sent them to help nope it's going to be because they believe not but god said what god did boy oh boy so to speak for a lack of a better word when you think about this generation of churanity that's seen the power of god even that god himself had taken his picture with this prophet they can look at it and they still don't please i dare i dare you i dare tell you you're out of two tarts that could determine your eternal validation because if that truly was god you say i don't believe that you're just believing god sure if it was fake you wouldn't have to worry about it but that's not fake when he would discern the thoughts and intent to the people's heart jesus would come back and do the very same things that he did remember brother troy read that where he says you know they came and they walked with cleophys and and so forth on the road to emmaus and they went in they invited him in and he did something that he had done before the resident before he had died that they recognized and they knew him and he vanished out of this height the prophet come and preached many a message and says you know if you'll come and do something that he did before the resurrection will you believe it meaning people would not believe him i guarantee you this church should be full of the dead the baptist church over there would be empty the methodist church would be empty all in churches be empty if they believe what jesus did today unbelief is a terrible thing folks all of this ivy all of that sin that waved in the wave of sin that came in was because the church world chose barabbas they chose some a murderer over jesus christ they did not accept jesus christ the religious order that they did neither did the religious order of today accept jesus christ i believe that god said i will restore we have gotten this we have gotten this whole church world and this bible in a mix we adopt this methodist amish mennonite beachy amish men and i know olbermann and all kinds of different ones [Music] church of christ pentecostal first church of christ second church of christ so far church of christ how many churches of christ hello we had gotten things in the mess but god said i will restore saith the lord all of those years and all that mess up i'm going to come and i'm going to show you that i am alive and well and i'll tell you what if you truly believe that jesus is alive and well and he's coming back for you and me it does something to you it'll make you live different it'll make you focus differently it'll get you to looking on things involving non things below it'll make you not care about the cares of life as much and it'll make you shake the kingdom of god more [Music] huh that's what it will do oh how many beliefs is how many believers they call us message believers we believe god's message i'll send you elijah the prophet before the great they are the lord and he's gonna prove to you that he raised two thousand years ago but we couldn't know for sure there for a while we didn't know what church he was in we didn't know what to believe but he gave us an absolute precise amen if you remember the prophet when he was about seven years old had a whirlwind come into a tree they're right and he said don't you ever drink don't ever smoke or defile your body in any way for i have a work for you to do i'm a believer i believe god said that to him because he had to work and he did the work i'm part of that work i'm part of the restoration process oh my amen aren't you glad this morning that you're a part of that process he promised he would do it and he did it people one time in the bible ask him how can i work the works of god what did jesus say and believe on him whom he had sent is correct oh my not just jesus that's who he believed to be saved but he also said paul paul said if anybody come and preach anything other than what i've told you let me name you from heaven let it be a curse any spiritual or prophet let him acknowledge him but we write to you are the commandments of the lord iranians martin luther klump is all of those all the way down to brother bannon that one is the one that is hardest for people to accept because he was born right here in kentucky praise be to god god saw fit to bring the last greatest prophet right out of our kentucky state glory doesn't make kentucky all that special but it does just a little bit huh praise the lord i mean he's glad [Applause] i'm glad that i have the ability to believe i'm a believer not a doubter and by faith i'll make it through my whole world is so different i believe this world is so different because it takes you into forgiveness into grace it gives you the baptism of the holy ghost if thou cans believe all things are possible anything's possible this morning if you'll just get your faith right think about it with all of your heart all of your mind all of your soul all of your strength it's got to be believed from down here [Applause] [Music] oh my only have two quotes here's another one listen to what he said he says what is sin is drinking whiskey is not sin smoking cigarettes committing adultery that's not sin that's just the attributes of sin look he says long ago preaching a message in the church i said stealing's not a sin lying not a sin committing adultery is not a sin i couldn't get much further until old methodist says pardon me preacher what is sin isn't that right [Applause] sanctified mother raised up said brethren what is sin he says now thy said unbelief is in the attribution that all of that other is the attributes of sin you do those things because you don't believe hallelujah you ain't got no shots ain't got no hallelujah you don't pray you don't go to church because you don't believe you don't go to church because you ain't got the holy ghost because if you got the holy ghost it's like a magnet churches like a magnet i don't believe it like i'm not you just love to do it you can't wait for them to respond amen you got the holy ghost if you truly believe he's coming how do you know you're going to get ready ain't no preacher gonna have to tell you to get ready you're gonna get ready whether he says it or not he can be as backslid as the day is long but you're not gonna be ain't no preacher gonna keep me out of heaven [Music] you lie you cheat you steal you smoke you lie and commit adultery because you are an unbeliever because you don't believe you get called on god because you don't believe that's why a believer oh my are you ready i believe loves his neighbor a believer loves his enemy a believer loves to forgive a believer loves to worship a believer of sis neighbors huh i believe her don't cheat lie steal smoke two oh you love the things that's right if you're a believer how many knows it's just your nature that's what we needed that's what easter we needed from easter was a nature change we need to be dead to unbelief a tree is known by its fruits if these things are in you you need a good old-fashioned holy ghost baptism [Applause] isn't that right thank you lord i like that he said i believe because you knew that it was the key if he says if thou canst believe he said i believe but he had doubt he had doubt didn't he the one thing that man did that i can say that brother brown said about doubt what did he say about your doubt doubt you down that's right he says i believe because i'm doubting that doubt help my doubt help me to believe fight that thing with everything you got there's unbelief in your heart fight it with all your god to god get rid of my unbelief help me to 150 be focused that i want to make this rapture because i'm here to tell you right now that the world is right to burn god's picture in the earliest if you ain't place a true believer you're gonna burn with it it is getting right it is ready for burning it's vile out there it's terrible out there when he's coming anytime i feel it be ready it's time to get away from these walls it's time to get away from their unbelief it's time to get way away from starchiness from coldness on god huh get rid of all unbelief hey [Music] let me tell you this belief if you truly you'll get your sights set right set your affections on things above i was driving down the road been driving down the road on vacation different places there's one thing i hate is to see dead animals along the road dead animals get slaughtered some of them were spread out there by themselves it's horrible like that's terrible that's terrible and i thought you know i thought about saying this and in my mind i go and i pray for them little animals that little that little dog and that little dog raises back up raise that back up raise that deer back up huh wouldn't it be something just raise them all up and then in my mind i thought you know but if that dog could talk in his funny little mouth and snout and he talked to me you know he'd say why don't you do that for what you do that for dear what'd you do that for that was terrible that death was terrible and now i'm gonna have to do it again thanks to you crazy thoughts i think right but that's what i thought i thought that's probably what they tell me because we're mortal yet and i'm gonna have to die and somehow it ain't no fun i was gone i was history it's all done and that was fine i had to scavenge for my food i was going around hungry and everything else and every other predator tried to get me it was a terrible life i was all right here you brought me back to have to do it now what the department of god said a lot of us want old folks great hair like me we think hey i'd like to be 20 again he says why do you want to go back young again who'd want to do this again who wants to go through this again what time's fine with me in that right what time i'm with me because in my heart i'm like that little animal you know because i don't really want to do it again i want something better how many is looking for a country this builder and maker is god amen abraham had this testimony that he wanted a country how many is looking for a better country i want a country where is he turned off i'm looking for an eternal home there my home shall be eternal i'm telling you but i'm longing for you and someday sure as he proved he's alive on the uh stands there my home's not gonna be attempting the temporal then we finally got our farm built up the bike the way we wanted got a house a dedication the way we want it's nice i look down in the woods and i say well i can maybe do this 10 years 15 i'll be gone i says i want the country i want to build me a house i can stay there how about you this morning how many is looking for an eternal home and then the holy ghost and if you're truly a believer amen you're not like the gentiles who seek for not things of this world and the clothes that they wear the food that they eat and all of that that's the gentile that believer seeks a country that is beyond this how many believes we ought to have our sights different than what we do i believe we could all come to the offer and say i got my sights a little bit much on the things of this world i got it too much lord reach your hands too much on this world i don't have enough on what's coming now think about the groaning and the groaning that's going on in this world how many believes the whole creation is in grown i don't know if i could make a proper going in pain huh ask sister hannah what groaning is her brother brad they probably know at the nursing home the ingroaning of those old folks huh people everywhere in house groaning people sick groaning people empty groaning the whole creation the bible says is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god amen and i love the peace i've got to love that you all got i love all that but there's still something here that's groaning within us the bible says we ourselves grown within ourselves to do what the wit to witness the redemption of our body and that right brother chris we're groaning we want to see the redemption of our body amen how many is looking what a resurrection i want to honor before i go on perhaps in the conclusion of that let's go back and pick up in this generation i want you to understand something and that is that in this generation we had another crucifixion of the lord and we had another resurrection of the lord a resurrection out of deep dark denominations denominational ages and they crucified him brother ben's message called there they crucified him and he says i invite this generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ just like jesus did with those pharisees you by your traditions have made the word of god of not affecting the people we can say those churches made god's word what god did in degeneration of not affecting their people when he comes right down they chose your own ideas just like the pharisees over the proven vindicated word of god thereby crucifying the facts of the word but how many believes he's resurrected in the people he's directed into people that believes him just like peter he was resurrected in those that believed him not those that crucified him and they could just go in a shadow of peter and be healed isn't that right to think that jesus christ come in this generation millions of healings and to preach the word of god but started out with the healing that drew everybody but when it comes down to preaching to the word they didn't want to hear him just like with jesus they chose barabbas something that would kill him over somebody that would save them because that's what this message does it saves you it is christ it's what christ done not some man so i believe the story i believe the story when he said don't drink or smoke or defy your body in any way forever work for you to do and then brother bannon belonged to baptist church going to church and everything and and he seemed they were fixing the ordained women preachers was it what was his that pastor's name again brother roy davis roy davis he said no you're going to dedicate him you belong to this church well i get none that's against the scriptures huh and a little bit later an angel came to brother man and says you know you're going to pray for monarchs and kings and potentiates you're going to have a worldwide ministry and brother i'm told his pastor and he says angel said that this is what i'm going to do you with a seventh grade education what kind of dream did you have huh he didn't believe it but says if that's the attitude that you have i'm gonna give you my resignation i'm gonna give you my fellowship card no don't do that don't do that he says yes i might as well now because it's going to happen later anyway that's exactly what's going to happen you embrace the message at this hour churches will kick you out that's right and anyway listen he did that and and well do i believe yeah i believe it because he did i mean he knows the proof is in the pudding he went kings and told all kinds of people that he prayed for and me that were healed people around the world that were saved huh thirty thousand went one time he says that's ten times pentecost that christ did [Music] he says you know i anybody can preach he said anybody can preach but when god comes and he vindicates it and proves it then it's sin for you to disbelieve and think about it that's exactly what they did people even though they could see it with their eyes they could hear it you're not from so-and-so that wasn't the prophet speaking he would jesus christ the holy spirit would take brother banham's body over and he'd do the talk how many believes that he would do the talking that's why that's why he challenged anybody anywhere to come and point to him where that discernment was ever wrong i mean it was never wrong [Music] and you know what because he said if it had been wrong then god would have been wrong isn't that right and god can't be wrong god's not wrong i gotta read this story again but i gotta hear it again but this one lady says they were friends and he told her where she lived out and her friend after services you don't live there he was wrong about that she said no i moved here today he was exactly right i dare say this i dare say this that if it was ever wrong it wasn't discernment and it was just brother brandon getting in the way because god ain't never wrong but when it came to that discernment brother benham knew not to play he wouldn't just he wouldn't just say or he wouldn't just he says i'm wait for him to come i can't tell you not until he tells me because he knew better than the good presumptuously he waited until the angel said and then he would have thus saith the lord and it's going to happen amen people don't want to believe that when he went over and beyond the curtain of time isn't that right see i believe i believe what he said how many believes how many believe it when he went beyond the curtain of time and he come back and he told the church the story of how he's over there he was in his bed one morning he had his hands over his back there and he thought boy 52 years old i better get to doing something to the lord if i better do [Music] it and directly he was caught up and he looked back there was his body and there he was up there and he began to see millions of people women with long hair beautiful blackened hair whatever color they were robes on a man and also in the prime of youth and coming up and hugging him and so forth and all these things that happened now if i'm not wrong he also has seen his dog in his horse now right his horse come up over his shoulder knickers just like his old horse did and fritz i believe it was the one that the neighbors poisoned you know and somebody got unbelieving said brother brandon i like your story until you had your dog or your heart you haven't got no no heaven isn't for horses let me tell you something you better watch off right he says i appreciate your criticism and so forth but while the body lights his horses that came down in the chariots that took him up what about in revelations 19 he comes back from the heavens of heavens and all the hosts of heaven and he come on why don't you where they're all at [Music] don't tell god what he can and can't do narrow-minded unbeliever i believe it how many believes you're a part of those over there he's seen millions he said are these all branhams no they're not bannons they're your commerce that you led to christ millions of people praise be to god i believe i believe it i believe there could be a rapture i believe there's gonna be oh boy i'll tell you what does the devil never do to you like he does to me you're not gonna make the rapture you're not good enough to make rapture look at your mistakes how are you going to make the rapture i mean with me come on the devil don't you believe his lie don't you believe that for a minute because god's word if he has saved you if he brought you save this fight he will lead you all the way home i refuse to doubt lord help my unbelief lord i believe that you you came on earth and that you died for me i believe that your blood was shed so i could be righteous i believe that you saved me on a certain time amen a certain day that i can say that's why i recognized it i believe that you have kept me all of these years i believe that you will lead me all the way through in this dark hour when russia could just begin throwing some like a fine oh god that we're going to be in glory before it happens i believe that one of these mornings i'm going to feel a change come over me and i will go from locality to immortality and my heart is groaning for it it's starting to pull a little harder how about you it's pulling harder look lord i'm ready to get out of here have me ready help me not to disbelieve one word that you have said eve disbelieved one word and it'll take believing every word to get you back into the garden of eden how many believes there's a heaven how many believe there's going to be a millennium we're living thousand years with christ and then through the eons of ages of time beyond that and folks it can't be but a few more short years for us here if not by this afternoon i don't know about you but i'm not looking for the years i'm looking for this afternoon i'm looking for every day for him to come and this morning i simply say thank you lord jesus for helping me and being able to believe your word how many with me say thank you lord for being helping me to believe your word not say i believe but truly believe in test yourself this morning this is a testing ground do you have any of those attributes that we mentioned a while ago the attributes of sin the attributes of unbelief huh what kind of fruit is growing on your tree do you have perfect love joy peace long suffering gentleness meekness patience we all need more patience i sure do now want more how many doesn't want any of the attributes of onsen i don't want to lie cheat steal i want everything above board i want everything right are you with me we want to get ready for what's coming folks because the world is getting real dark amen i i can feel it that russia i mean i say we've got a nuke for us according to the public god they're already saying that because we're giving them arms they've got something special for us we don't know what it is ah i can feel them getting on the verge go ahead and push it we have enough of them hypocrites let's blow them up we had enough of the roma pope hypocrite huh we had enough of them because rome has a bomb for rome russia has a bomb for rome too now right in one day it's gonna get blown up one hour the bible says she'll burn amen and they're getting closer the conditions are getting close how many beliefs are you can perhaps watch our young people in these meetings so for the young folks if you're smart you'll get close to christ and i believe they are there's a group that's getting closer because if you go out in the world where you're going to be cannon father from the devil you'll eat your flesh and spit out your bones yeah that's what he'll do it's absolutely chaos out there i'm glad not to be in chaos it's because you believe oh my how many let's just give the lord a hand thank you jesus thank you lord thank you for letting us believe i'm a believer not a dollar and by faith i'll make it through stand with me if you will stand with me musicians if you'll come let's worship the lord a little this morning but before we do we want to close our eyes amen
