[18:17] each and everyone out on such a
[18:19] beautiful morning. Amen. And it's a
[18:23] little chilly outside, but we have a
[18:25] wonderful, wonderful place inside to

[18:33] him to open the service in a word of
[18:35] prayer. Brother Troy,

[20:01] Christ's name. Amen.
[20:04] If you'll just go with me in the Psalms
[20:05] this morning. We're going to go over to
[20:07] Psalms 40.
[20:12] Psalms 40.
[20:18] I waited patiently for the Lord, and he
[20:21] inclined unto me and heard my cry.
[20:34] He hath put a new song in my mouth, even
[20:36] praise unto our God. Many shall see it
[20:40] in fear, and shall trust in all the in
[20:42] the Lord.
[20:52] Many, oh Lord, my God, are in thy
[20:55] wonderful works which thou hast done,
[20:57] and thy thoughts which are to us, ward,
[21:00] they cannot be reckoned up in order unto
[21:03] thee. If I would declare and speak of
[21:05] them, they are more than can be
[21:07] numbered.
[21:18] Then said I, low, I come in the volume
[21:21] of the book. It is written of me.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; I have preached righteousness in the
[21:31] great congregation. Lo, I have not
[21:33] refrained my lips. Oh Lord, thou
[21:36] knowest.
[21:51] withhold not thou thy tender mercies
[21:53] from me, oh Lord, thy loving kindness
[21:56] and thy truth continually preserve me.
[22:13] Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me, O
[22:15] Lord. Make haste to help me.
[22:28] Let them be desolate for a reward of
[22:31] their shame that they say unto me, "Aha!
[22:34] Aha!"
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Let's together. But I am poor and needy,
[22:47] yet the Lord thinkketh upon me. Thou art
[22:50] my help and my deliverer. Make no
[22:53] tearing. Oh my God. God bless you,
[22:55] brother David.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; This morning, it's good to see each and
[23:08] everyone out this morning. And brother
[23:10] John, Sister Alicia, and Jonathan, it's
[23:12] good to see y'all back again. And man,
[23:14] we missed you. And I know brother John
[23:16] hated to be gone when he got to be with
[23:18] that with Jack, but you know them
[23:21] grandkids, they're special, aren't they,
[23:22] brother John? And I love Brother John
[23:24] always smiles. But when you talk about
[23:26] his grandkids, he really smiles then.
[23:28] Amen. We're just just want to thank the
[23:30] Lord for watching over for Zoe and Josh
[23:33] and little Haven last night. And at
[23:35] first they saw thought Sister Zoe had a
[23:38] a broken arm, but she didn't have. And
[23:40] so they're resting this morning. We just
[23:42] want to say thank you, Lord, and give
[23:43] the Lord a hand of praise this morning.
[23:46] Amen. He is He's an awesome God this
[23:49] morning, you know, and we we live in a
[23:53] in a crazy world. Amen. Let's sing that

[24:03] gates with thanksgiving in my heart. I
[24:07] will enter his courts with praise.
[24:13] Oh, I will say this is the day that the
[24:17] Lord has made. Well, I will rejoice.

[25:54] you. We welcome each and everyone this
[25:55] morning. I don't see any visitors. It

[26:01] morning. Amen.
[26:04] Well, I'm rejoicing night and day. Oh,

[26:12] of God in all my life, I see.
[26:19] of my bliss. Yes, the secret. All is
[26:24] this. For the comforter abides with me.

[26:43] Will I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[26:48] walk this narrow way for the hand of God
[26:53] is with me.
[26:56] And once my heart was full of sin. Once
[27:00] I had no peace within.
[27:05] How Jesus died upon the tree.
[27:10] Then I fell down at his feet. And there
[27:14] came a feast so sweet. Now the comforter

[28:40] Now there's no thirsting for the things
[28:43] of this world. They've taken wings. Long

[30:10] has for us by the way of his word. And

[30:18] morning. And but we've got youth that's

[30:34] of our hearts this morning. Well, when
[30:37] pains of death seized on my soul unto
[30:43] the Lord, I cry.
[30:48] till Jesus
[30:50] came and he made me whole. Well, I would
[30:55] not be denied.
[30:59] Well, I would not be denied.
[31:05] Oh, I would not be denied.
[31:12] until Jesus came and he made me whole.
[31:18] Well, I would not be denied.
[31:23] Well, as Jacob in the days of Lord, will
[31:30] I wrestle with the Lord
[31:36] at time with a courage?

[32:00] Well, till Jesus came and he made me
[32:05] whole. Well, I would not be denied.
[32:12] Well, oh, Satan
[32:14] said my Lord was gone and he would not
[32:23] Yes.
[32:24] But praise the Lord. The word is God.
[32:31] Christ the Lord is here.
[32:36] Well, I would not be denied.
[32:42] Oh, I would not be denied.
[32:48] until Jesus came and he made me whole.
[32:55] But I would not be. Sing that last verse
[32:59] again if we could. Well, oh, Satan said,
[33:04] "My Lord was gone and he would not hear
[33:10] my prayer."
[33:13] But praise the Lord, the work is done
[33:19] and Christ the Lord is here.
[33:24] Well, I would not be denied.
[33:31] Oh, no I would not be denied
[33:37] until Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[33:44] would not be denied.
[33:49] Amen.
[33:51] Is that your desire this morning? How
[33:53] many's ever had the devil tell you that
[33:55] it don't matter? God don't hear your
[33:57] prayer when you're praying. And I always
[33:59] tell him, I said, 'Well, if it don't
[34:00] matter, why are you bothering me while
[34:02] I'm praying? If my prayers ain't no good
[34:05] and he don't hear them, why are you
[34:07] bothering me this morning? But I believe
[34:09] we have a prayer answering God this
[34:11] morning. Don't you, brother Daniel and
[34:13] brother Michael John, Brother Paul,
[34:14] would you come this morning? And we have
[34:16] some prayer requests this morning. And
[34:19] we want to take them to the Lord in
[34:20] prayer. Like I said, we thank the Lord
[34:22] for watching over Zoe and and Josh and
[34:26] little Haven. and just want to pray that
[34:28] God will continue to heal their body
[34:29] this morning. And also remember sister
[34:31] Parish and Sister Peggy, our shutins.
[34:34] And also we want to continue to remember
[34:36] McCagan and and Paulie and Palmer this
[34:39] morning that God will continue to be
[34:40] with them. And and also Aiden and Katie
[34:43] Wade are sick this morning. We want to
[34:45] remember them in prayer that God will
[34:46] just touch their body this morning. And
[34:48] also uh Brother Joe said remember Sister
[34:51] Hannah. She's here this morning. Her
[34:53] back's bothering her this morning. and
[34:54] just pray that God will just touch her
[34:56] body this morning. If you have a need in
[34:58] your heart, you might let it be known
[35:00] this morning. And Amen. Brother Tommy,
[35:01] would you stand and pray over Well, he's
[35:03] gone. I I just thought I seen him over
[35:06] there. I'm sorry. Brother Wade, Jonathan
[35:08] Wade, would you stand and pray this
[35:10] morning?
[36:54] Amen. Let's sing that song. I keep
[36:57] falling in love with him over and
[37:00] well. When I first fell in love with
[37:03] Jesus
[37:04] and I gave him all of my heart
[37:09] and I thought I couldn't love him more
[37:13] than I did right from the start.
[37:17] But when I look back over the mountains
[37:21] and the valleys where I've been
[37:25] and it makes me know I love him so much
[37:30] more than I
[37:32] Oh, I keep falling in love with him over
[37:36] and over and over and over again. Oh, I
[37:42] keep falling in love with him over and
[37:45] over and over and over again. Oh, he
[37:50] gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go
[37:53] by. Oh, what a love.
[37:57] And I keep falling in love with him over
[38:01] and over and over and over again. Well,
[38:06] there's a hand that I hold on to through
[38:10] each valley and each trial.
[38:14] And there's a shoulder that I lean upon
[38:18] as I face another mile. Well, there's a
[38:23] love that I can depend on. It's fresh
[38:28] and new each day.
[38:30] And with love, my heart is overflowing.
[38:34] And that is why I say, "Oh, I keep
[38:39] falling in love with him over and over
[38:42] again." Over and over again. Oh, I keep
[38:47] falling in love with him over and over
[38:51] and over and over again. He gets sweeter
[38:56] and sweeter as the day goes by. Oh, what
[39:00] a love between my Lord and I. keep
[39:03] falling in love with him over and over
[39:07] and over and over.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Well, good morning. Isn't that the
[39:16] truth?
[39:17] &gt;&gt; The more you know him, the more you fall
[39:19] in love.
[39:37] This house where I'm living, it's not
[39:40] much to look at, but I'm blessed and I
[39:43] call it mine.
[39:46] But soon I'll be leaving to go live with
[39:50] Jesus. You can have it if you're left
[39:53] behind.
[39:55] Cuz I hold a clear title to a home
[39:58] that's far better, that would never
[40:01] flood or decay.
[40:04] If the rapture was yesterday, would you
[40:07] still be here today?
[40:13] If the rapture was yesterday, would you
[40:16] still be here today?
[40:20] If the trumpet had sounded by saints
[40:23] surrounded, would you have been called
[40:26] away
[40:28] while there's still time to make up your
[40:32] mind? Let me invite you to pray.
[40:37] If the rapture was yesterday, would you
[40:41] still be here today?
[40:47] Jesus.
[40:54] Jesus said when he comes back, two will
[40:57] be sleeping, one taken and one left
[41:01] behind.
[41:03] How people can go on who aren't rapture
[41:07] ready. Don't it just stagger your mind
[41:17] for a one new lead either way.
[41:21] If the rapture was yesterday, would you
[41:24] still be here today?
[41:30] If the rapture was yesterday, would you
[41:33] still be here today?
[41:37] If the trumpet had sounded by saints
[41:40] surrounded, would you have been called
[41:44] away?
[41:46] While there's still time to make up your
[41:49] mind, let me invite you to pray.
[41:54] If the rapture was yesterday, would you
[41:58] still be here today?
[42:03] If the rapture was yesterday, we
[42:06] wouldn't be here today.
[42:10] If the trumpet had sounded by saints
[42:13] surrounded, we would have been called
[42:17] away.
[42:19] While there's still time for you to make
[42:21] up your mind, let us invite you to pray.
[42:27] If the rapture was yesterday, we
[42:30] wouldn't be here today.
[42:36] If the rapture was yesterday, we
[42:39] wouldn't be here today.
[42:47] Well, God bless you all and I hope the
[42:49] Lord appreciates that
[42:52] young man.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:57] Appreciate Brother Glenn, don't you? And
[42:59] his love for the Lord. and he asked me

[43:05] he asked me this morning, I said, "No,
[43:07] Brother Glenn, I I had an excuse. My
[43:09] daughter's here this morning." And I
[43:11] said, "I didn't take time and practice."

[46:00] my sin
[46:03] upon that cross. Well, I'll never know
[46:09] how much it cost to see my sin upon that
[46:17] cross. I'll never know how much it cost
[46:24] to see my sin
[46:28] upon the cross.

[52:05] Lords. That's what we're here to do,
[52:07] right? To praise him, to lift him up, to
[52:09] worship him, to give him the glory that
[52:11] he deserves in this hour. Amen. Good to
[52:14] be in the house of the Lord this
[52:15] morning. And we uh certainly uh thankful
[52:18] for your prayers. We've we felt them.
[52:20] And I tell you, last night things just
[52:22] begin to pour and reveal. Thank you,
[52:24] musicians. We appreciate you.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Aren't we thankful for our musicians? I
[52:28] tell you what, we sure appreciate him,
[52:31] brother Daniel. Way to step up, buddy.
[52:34] Way to step up. So, we uh we certainly
[52:38] appreciate him. But I do do appreciate
[52:39] your prayers. Felt your pres the prayers
[52:41] and the presence of the Lord as things
[52:43] begin to just unfold to me. So, we uh
[52:46] want to thank you for that. And I was
[52:48] just back there. I was peeking in on
[52:50] Brother Ber preaching there at Brother
[52:52] Ron's this morning for just a minute.
[52:53] And he's right in the middle of the
[52:55] heart of things. So, we'll remember him
[52:57] in prayer this morning, too. Turn with
[52:59] me, if you would, into the into your
[53:00] Bibles to the book of Galatians.
[53:08] How many come to have church?
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:12] I tell you, we're living in a in an hour
[53:15] where there's no better place to be and
[53:17] no no better thing to do than to come
[53:19] and have church and to hear the word and
[53:21] let the word live through us and and
[53:23] lead us and guide us. So we uh we
[53:26] certainly want to uh give our part to
[53:29] the Lord. So,
[53:33] Brother Brandham is speaking. I want to
[53:34] speak this morning just to go ahead and
[53:36] give our title, but I want to speak this
[53:39] morning on Abraham's seed
[53:42] fully equipped. Abraham's seed fully
[53:46] equipped. The prophet tells us, he says,
[53:48] "The devil can beat you around and he
[53:51] can beat you around the stump on your
[53:52] feelings." He said, ' If I had to go by
[53:54] my feelings, there wouldn't be many
[53:56] times that I would uh that I there
[53:58] wouldn't be many times that I would be
[54:00] all out of condition. But I don't rest
[54:02] on my feelings.
[54:04] He said, I rest upon the unconditional
[54:07] word of the living God who made the
[54:10] covenant with me that if I would believe
[54:14] it,
[54:16] not if I would feel it, but what I
[54:19] believe in. He said, Jesus never said,
[54:22] "Did you feel it?" He said, "Do you
[54:25] believe it?" He said, "Now, I want you
[54:27] to notice this one time, Israel, they
[54:29] was called out to war against the
[54:31] Philistines." He said, "And the
[54:33] Philistines had gathered over on the
[54:35] side of the mountain and a and there was
[54:37] a valley between them and Israel on the
[54:39] other side." And just as the enemy
[54:41] always does, he feel he felt like he's
[54:44] got the upper hand.
[54:47] He said, "And when he feels like he's
[54:49] got the upper hand, he likes to puff and
[54:52] he likes to blow and he likes to brag
[54:55] about it." How many's ever had Satan do
[54:57] that to you? He you he thinks he's got
[55:00] the upper hand and he thinks, listen
[55:02] what he says. He thinks if he can just
[55:04] GET YOU TO COW DOWN. He said if he
[55:07] thinks that he can get your little heart
[55:09] to flutter a few times to make you think
[55:11] you didn't get your healing.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "Yeah." He says, he likes to do
[55:18] things like that. If he can get you to
[55:20] look at your hand and say, "My hand's no
[55:22] better." He loves to do that because
[55:24] he's got you conquered right then.
[55:28] He's got you conquered right then. If he
[55:29] could just get you to think that.
[55:32] We don't rely on thinking. We don't rely
[55:35] on feelings, but we rely on the
[55:37] unadulterated tr PROVEN TRUE WORD OF
[55:40] GOD.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says. I see a crutch
[55:45] sitting back there here by a lady.
[55:48] He said if if he can make her believe
[55:51] that she's going to have to use that
[55:53] crutch to get out of here, she's
[55:55] whipped.
[55:57] But when she won't look at that, but
[55:59] when she will look towards the promise
[56:01] of God, that crutch will be left in ITS
[56:05] SEAT.
[56:06] SHE WON'T NEED A CRUTCH TO LEAVE OUT OF
[56:08] THE BUILDING, BUT WHEN SHE STANDS ON THE
[56:10] WORD, THE CRUTCH WILL STAY AND SHE WILL
[56:12] LEAVE.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Galatians chapter 3,
[56:22] it's already getting warm up here.
[56:31] Chapter 3:22.
[56:33] But the scripture hath concluded all
[56:36] under sin,
[56:38] that the promise by faith of Jesus
[56:40] Christ may be given unto them that what?
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Believe. But before faith came, might we
[56:47] say, before Jesus came,
[56:50] listen to this. Before faith came, we
[56:53] were kept under the law, shut up unto
[56:56] faith which should afterwards be
[56:58] revealed. Therefore, wherefore the law
[57:00] was our school master to bring us unto
[57:03] Christ. Do this, do that, go here, do
[57:06] that, act this way, speak this way, the
[57:09] treat the temple this way. The law was
[57:12] our school master to bring us to Christ
[57:15] that we might be justified by faith. But
[57:18] after faith come, after Jesus arrived on
[57:22] the scene, after after the Holy Ghost,
[57:24] after the ca after the crucifixion,
[57:26] after the Holy Ghost, after faith had
[57:28] come on the scene, we are no longer
[57:31] under a school master.
[57:33] FOR WE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD by
[57:36] faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of
[57:40] you has been baptized into Christ have
[57:43] put on Christ. So you if you've BEEN
[57:47] BAPTIZED IN CHRIST, YOU HAVE PUT ON
[57:50] FAITH. YOU'VE PUT ON CHRIST. YOU'VE
[57:52] UNDER YOU PUT ON OVERCOMING POWER AND
[57:54] YOU NO longer live under the thumb of
[57:57] the law. But now we live, brothers and
[58:00] sisters, under the blood THAT WAS SHED
[58:02] ON CALVARY. SO IT'S NO LONGER a set of
[58:05] rules to follow. Think about this. Come
[58:08] on, church. It's no longer a set of
[58:10] rules TO FOLLOW, BUT NOW it's a love
[58:13] affair. It's a love affair that grows
[58:15] deeper and deeper and deeper every day
[58:18] as the day goes by. Because what? THE
[58:21] HUSBAND AND THE BRIDE ARE BECOMING ONE.
[58:24] THEY'RE BECOMING ONE THOUGHT. THEY'RE
[58:26] BECOMING ONE IN ACTION. THEY'RE BECOMING
[58:28] ONE IN MIND. AND JUST LIKE IT WAS ON the
[58:31] day of Pentecost, they're becoming in
[58:34] one accord.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; There was neither Jew nor Greek. There
[58:42] was neither blood by bond or free. There
[58:44] was neither male or female. For ye are
[58:47] all one.
[58:50] On the day of Pentecost, they were what?
[58:52] &gt;&gt; One. But you are all now one in Christ.
[58:56] And if and if be you be in Christ, then
[58:58] ye are Abraham's seed and hes according
[59:02] to the promise. Let's just bow our
[59:05] heads. Heavenly Father, we come before
[59:06] you this morning with grateful hearts,
[59:08] Lord. Thankful that you've laid this
[59:10] message on our hearts. And Lord, we put
[59:13] notes on paper as so to speak and we've
[59:16] got thoughts processing in our mind. But
[59:19] Lord, it's not about my my thinking or
[59:21] my thoughts, but it's about you moving
[59:23] on the scene. It's about your presence
[59:25] in the building. And Lord, we feel you
[59:26] this morning. We just ask Lord that you
[59:29] would just move in our midst and in the
[59:31] congregation that you just sweep through
[59:33] the aisles this morning.
[59:36] Encourage those that are un unencouraged
[59:38] this morning.
[59:40] release people from the bonds of
[59:42] depression and fear and doubts and
[59:45] worries, all the the anxieties that are
[59:48] pressed upon us in this hour we living
[59:50] in. It's a tough hour, Lord. But if we
[59:53] stay true to the word and and and don't
[59:55] fail to rely upon your promises, the
[59:58] word says we'll be free. So Lord, speak
[1:00:01] to our hearts this morning. Allow us to
[1:00:03] grasp the reality of the word in our
[1:00:05] lives. We love you, Lord. We lift you on
[1:00:08] high and thank you for all you do in
[1:00:10] Jesus name. Amen. You can have your
[1:00:12] seats this morning.
[1:00:15] Turn with me if you would into the book
[1:00:16] of John.
[1:00:22] We'll read a little bit out of chapter
[1:00:23] 8.
[1:00:29] John chapter 8 verse 31.
[1:00:33] Very familiar scriptures here.
[1:00:36] Jesus then said Jesus to those Jews
[1:00:39] which believed on him if you continue in
[1:00:43] my word
[1:00:45] then you be my disciples indeed and ye
[1:00:48] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:00:51] make you free and they answered answered
[1:00:55] him and said we be Abraham's seed. Now I
[1:00:57] want you to watch how these how these
[1:00:59] theologians were thinking. We be
[1:01:01] Abraham's seed and we've never been in
[1:01:03] bondage to any man. How sayest thou that
[1:01:06] ye shall be made free? And Jesus
[1:01:09] answered them and said, "Verily, verily,
[1:01:11] I say unto you, whosoever committh sin
[1:01:14] is the servant of sin."
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; If you're COMMITTING SIN, YOU ARE
[1:01:19] SERVANT TO THAT SIN. YOU ARE LETTING IT
[1:01:21] BE your master and your taskmaster.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; But now WATCH WHAT HE SAYS. AND THE
[1:01:28] SERVANT ABIDETH NOT IN THE HOUSE
[1:01:30] FOREVER.
[1:01:32] YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STAY IN THE PRESENCE
[1:01:34] OF GOD IF you're serving sin.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS NOT GOING TO BE IN THE
[1:01:39] PRESENCE OF YOUR HOME IF YOUR HOME IS
[1:01:41] FULL of sin.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; But but it says the son abideth
[1:01:50] ever.
[1:01:52] The son abideth ever. If the son
[1:01:54] therefore shall make YOU FREE, YE SHALL
[1:01:57] BE free indeed. Hallelujah. This
[1:02:01] morning, if you've been set free THIS
[1:02:03] MORNING BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST,
[1:02:05] YOU ARE FREE INDEED. SO, brothers and
[1:02:07] sisters, we're talking about a true
[1:02:08] spiritual freedom. And with this true
[1:02:11] SPIRITUAL FREEDOM COMES POWER, COMES
[1:02:14] AUTHORITY FROM JESUS CHRIST BECAUSE IT'S
[1:02:17] JESUS CHRIST THAT SETS YOU free today.
[1:02:20] IT'S JESUS CHRIST THAT has liberated his
[1:02:23] people from the bondage OF SIN. WE'RE
[1:02:27] NOT TALKING ABOUT A PHYSICAL BONDAGE.
[1:02:29] WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SHACKLES and
[1:02:31] chains and and being locked up in a
[1:02:33] prison. NO, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A
[1:02:35] MAN HOLDING US BACK. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE
[1:02:37] IN CHRIST, MAN CAN'T STOP YOU. MAN CAN'T
[1:02:40] HOLD YOU BACK.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; MAN MAY CRITICIZE. MAN MAY MOCK. MAN MAY
[1:02:45] put you down. But man will never stop
[1:02:48] the work of God.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's in a church, in a
[1:02:52] home, in a business. If you put God
[1:02:54] first,
[1:03:02] But Jesus is allowing you and I to in
[1:03:06] this day to live freely in the world
[1:03:10] that we're LIVING IN BY THE word of this
[1:03:13] day.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Well, I like that.
[1:03:18] Praise the Lord. Somebody's in tune.
[1:03:25] We're free this hour.
[1:03:27] BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE'RE FREE IN THIS
[1:03:28] DAY. WE'RE FREE IN THIS HOUR TO HAVE
[1:03:31] FAITH TO RECEIVE THE PROMISES THAT GOD
[1:03:34] AND THE blessings that God has laying in
[1:03:36] the word for every believer. It's for
[1:03:39] you and it's for I and it's ours freely
[1:03:42] to have. WHY? COME ON. WE'RE NO LONGER
[1:03:46] ARE we slaves to sin, but we're CHILDREN
[1:03:48] OF GOD.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; WEDNESDAY NIGHT, I SAID, "HOW MANY'S GOT
[1:03:51] THE HOLY GHOST?" HANDS ALL OVER THE
[1:03:53] BUILDING. WE'RE CHILDREN OF GOD. WE
[1:03:55] IDENTIFY WITH THAT. AND IF WE'RE GOING
[1:03:56] TO identify with that, why not reap the
[1:03:59] benefits of it?
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Don't expect the benefits and the
[1:04:06] rewards if you're not living the life.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; I better throw that in there. I don't
[1:04:11] want everybody thinking you can do what
[1:04:12] you want and the Lord's just going to bl
[1:04:14] That ain't the way it works.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; But we no longer HAVE TO BE SLAVES TO
[1:04:19] THE FEARS OF THIS LIFE. WE no longer
[1:04:21] HAVE TO BE SLAVES TO THE DOUBTS AND THE
[1:04:24] WORRIES AND THE UNBELIEF, the rage THAT
[1:04:28] THAT IS ALL AROUND us in this world. I
[1:04:31] don't have to be a slave to that.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; We don't have to let habits,
[1:04:41] filthy habits control our lives.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; We're no LONGER UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE
[1:04:49] EVIL THAT PRODUCES. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT
[1:04:50] IT PRODUCES. It produces spiritual
[1:04:53] death.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; And you SEE WHEN THAT SPIRITUAL DEATH
[1:05:00] COMES UPON PEOPLE WHO IS UNDER THAT VERY
[1:05:02] BONDAGE OF THE SPIRITUAL EVIL this
[1:05:05] world, YOU SEE THE MOANING, YOU see the
[1:05:08] groaning,
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; you see THE BELLY ACHING. NOBODY'S EVER
[1:05:11] HAPPY. NOTHING'S EVER GOOD ENOUGH.
[1:05:13] NOBODY PREACHES GOOD ENOUGH. NOBODY
[1:05:15] SINGS GOOD ENOUGH.
[1:05:19] There's always a murmur and a
[1:05:20] complaining in the camp when they're
[1:05:22] living a life of spiritual death.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the SPIRIT ON THE INSIDE IS
[1:05:29] SLOWLY DYING AWAY.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; But I'm not under the control of that
[1:05:36] spirit.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Our opening quote, brother Brandham,
[1:05:41] listen what he said. When Satan feels,
[1:05:46] we don't run on feelings. Satan runs on
[1:05:48] feelings.
[1:05:52] We run on an absolute.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; He runs on a mind game.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; HE SAID WHEN SATAN FEELS LIKE HE'S GOT
[1:05:59] THE UPPER HAND, HE HUFFS and puffs and
[1:06:01] blows and drags about. He said when he
[1:06:03] thinks,
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, HE THOUGHT HE WAS BETTER THAN
[1:06:07] GOD. HE THOUGHT that he wanted to HAVE A
[1:06:10] KINGDOM. HE THOUGHT HE could rule the
[1:06:13] world. HE THOUGHT THAT he could rule
[1:06:15] your lives.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; I GOT SOME WORD FOR HIM. HE THAT HAS
[1:06:21] BEEN SET FREE IS FREE INDEED. HE NO
[1:06:24] LONGER RULES MY LIFE.
[1:06:31] The enemy THINKS THAT HE CAN MAKE YOUR
[1:06:33] heart flutter.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, I just I've been feeling
[1:06:39] this and I've been feeling that. I think
[1:06:41] I might ought to go to the doctor.
[1:06:46] Well,
[1:06:49] maybe.
[1:06:51] But maybe God says, "By my stripes,
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; you're healed."
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; STANDING UPON THE PROMISES OF GOD.
[1:06:58] LISTEN WHAT HE SAYS. HE SAYS, "IF HE can
[1:07:01] make you look at your hand and say,
[1:07:02] "It's no better and makes you say it's
[1:07:05] no better." He loves to DO THAT BECAUSE
[1:07:08] HE'S GOT YOU CONQUERED RIGHT THEN. BUT
[1:07:11] BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THE WORD IN OUR
[1:07:12] DAY, THE WORD THAT WE'VE BEEN TAUGHT in
[1:07:14] the work that's BEEN PREACHED TO US OVER
[1:07:16] AND OVER AND OVER IS A WORD THAT SAYS WE
[1:07:20] ARE more than conquerors.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT TO BE CONQUERED, BUT WE'RE
[1:07:28] MORE THAN CONQUERORS. WE'RE NOT THE
[1:07:31] DEFEATED, BUT WE'RE THE VICTORIOUS in
[1:07:33] Christ.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S
[1:07:36] WHO WE'RE PREACHING TO TODAY.
[1:07:41] It's not through the law.
[1:07:44] Think about our scriptures. It's not
[1:07:47] through the law.
[1:07:49] It's not through the rules of man-made
[1:07:51] ideas. It's not under the dictatorship
[1:07:55] of theology.
[1:07:58] It's not even under the the the the
[1:08:00] ideas or the thinking of a pastor or a
[1:08:03] preacher.
[1:08:05] Don't y'all get so quiet. He'll listen.
[1:08:08] Brother Ber will listen. I'm not saying
[1:08:10] anything he won't agree with
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; because he knows and I know. And every
[1:08:14] preacher that preaches the word of God
[1:08:16] knows if we can get up here and start
[1:08:17] injecting, oh, this is my idea. This is
[1:08:19] my opinion.
[1:08:22] That's just what you got is man's idea
[1:08:25] and MAN'S OPINION.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A WORD IN THIS HOUR,
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; an absolute.
[1:08:33] Who cares what I think?
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, MY THINKING HAS GOTTEN
[1:08:37] ME IN A WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE over time.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Some of you is honest with me.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; But you know, when I stand up on the
[1:08:46] word of God,
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; things are a LOT DIFFERENT. SO, IT'S not
[1:08:52] under the rules of man and ideas, BUT
[1:08:54] IT'S BECAUSE HE FIRST loved me.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; That is where we STAND THIS MORNING.
[1:09:00] BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED ME AND HE CHOSE
[1:09:02] ME BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:09:05] HE CHOSE YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of
[1:09:07] the world and said you don't have to
[1:09:10] live in defeat.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; BROTHERS AND SISTERS, NOW A HEART, think
[1:09:16] about this, YOU AND I, OUR HEARTS THAT
[1:09:18] WAS ONCE HARD,
[1:09:20] our hearts THAT WERE ONCE FULL of a
[1:09:23] sinful nature, A HEART THAT WAS ONCE
[1:09:26] LIVING IN MISERY.
[1:09:28] LET ME TELL YOU, I WAS A MISERABLE
[1:09:30] PERSON BEFORE I GOT IN CHRIST.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; OH, I smiled. I I done this and I run
[1:09:36] and I done all I wanted to do with my
[1:09:38] friends. And even when I WAS MARRIED,
[1:09:40] BEFORE WE REALLY GOT IN CHRIST,
[1:09:43] MISERABLE.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; MISERABLE.
[1:09:56] You say, "Well, why was you miserable?"
[1:09:58] You was going to church. I was going to
[1:10:00] church. I was in church, but church
[1:10:02] wasn't in me.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; There's a difference.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; You can COME THROUGH THOSE DOORS TIME
[1:10:09] AFTER TIME after time, BUT IF WHAT YOU
[1:10:12] HEAR DON'T LEAVE WITH you
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; and YOU START LIVING THE WORD THAT
[1:10:16] YOU'VE HEARD PREACHED,
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; defeated Amen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; I was helpless and defeated.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; You know, life is so much better in
[1:10:36] Christ.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Life is Hallelujah.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; GIVE HIM PRAISE THIS MORNING. LIFE IS SO
[1:10:45] MUCH BETTER IN CHRIST.
[1:10:52] I've been through some times of defeat.
[1:10:54] Somebody look at me AND SAY, "WELL, HOW
[1:10:55] DID YOU GO THROUGH THAT? YOU YOU ALWAYS
[1:10:57] GET UP AND YOU JUST SMILE AND YOU GO ON.
[1:10:59] WHY? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO TO CHANGE
[1:11:00] IT?"
[1:11:05] I don't lay down in defeat. I say,
[1:11:08] "Lord, what are we going to do today?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; What direction are we GOING TO GO
[1:11:14] TODAY?" BECAUSE YESTERDAY DIDN'T WORK
[1:11:16] OUT TOO GOOD FOR ME. I must have had
[1:11:17] some of my own stinking thinking in it.
[1:11:19] So, Lord, what are we going to do today?
[1:11:23] the you know what I found out and we
[1:11:25] preach it but the more I pray the better
[1:11:27] I feel.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; THE MORE I GO BEFORE GOD IN PRAYER AND
[1:11:31] COMMIT and dedicate my life, my home, my
[1:11:33] children,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; my loved ones,
[1:11:38] THE MORE I GO IN PRAYER AND SAY, "GOD,
[1:11:41] YOU KNOW THEIR SITUATION. YOU KNOW THEIR
[1:11:44] SITUATION. YOU KNOW THIS ONE'S
[1:11:46] SITUATION.
[1:11:49] I COULD SAY A LOT OF THINGS BUT LORD you
[1:11:53] you can change the situation.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; So in prayer
[1:12:00] is where I find victory.
[1:12:03] In prayer is where I find victory. And I
[1:12:07] want to let you know I told about told
[1:12:08] you about our hearts that were hardened,
[1:12:10] our hearts that were miserable and our
[1:12:12] hearts that were that WERE DEPRESSED AND
[1:12:14] DEFEATED. BUT THAT SAME HEART
[1:12:19] THAT SAME HEART THAT HAS COME IN CONTACT
[1:12:21] WITH CHRIST AND IS NOW IN CHRIST, THAT
[1:12:23] SAME HEART HAS NOW BEEN TENDERIZED, THAT
[1:12:27] SAME HEART HAS BEEN SOFTENED UP. And the
[1:12:30] things that I USED TO DO, I don't do
[1:12:32] anymore.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; THE SINFUL NATURES THAT I ONCE HAD, I
[1:12:38] DON'T have it anymore. Amen.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; You say, "Man, somebody must have
[1:12:46] preached a real message to get you to
[1:12:48] change." No,
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T THAT AT ALL, MY FRIENDS. IT
[1:12:53] WASN'T BECAUSE SOME SOME PREACHER COME
[1:12:55] UP HERE AND PREACHED HELL, FIRE, AND
[1:12:57] DAMNATION TO me and scared me to an
[1:12:59] altar.
[1:13:01] You know, that was a trend.
[1:13:05] WOMEN DON'T CUT YOUR HAIR. WOMEN DON'T
[1:13:07] DO THIS. MEN DON'T DO THAT. BOYS DON'T
[1:13:09] DO THIS. GIRLS DON'T DO THAT. AND IF YOU
[1:13:11] DON'T COME UP HERE TO THIS ALTAR AND
[1:13:13] REPENT IN 10 SECONDS, YOU'RE GOING
[1:13:15] STRAIGHT TO HELL. 10.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; NINE.
[1:13:21] YOU LET SOMEBODY GET UP HERE AND PREACH
[1:13:22] WITH SOME POWER AND AUTHORITY AND SEE IF
[1:13:24] THE THAT THE PEWS DON'T clear out and
[1:13:26] everybody be up HERE WEEPING AND
[1:13:27] SOBBING. GOD HELP ME.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; But does it stick?
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; But does it is rules and regulations,
[1:13:35] BROTHERS AND SISTERS? BUT WE ARE THE
[1:13:37] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. IT'S NOT ABOUT
[1:13:40] DOS AND DON'TS.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; God don't have to threaten you.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; You're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. If I went to
[1:13:59] threatening that pretty lady right
[1:14:01] there,
[1:14:04] I'd be picking my eyeballs up off the
[1:14:06] ground.
[1:14:12] I guarantee you, you can laugh you want,
[1:14:15] man. You be doing the same thing
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; because women are not doormats.
[1:14:24] AND THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST IS NOT A
[1:14:26] DOORMAT
[1:14:28] TO BE TOLD, "DO THIS, DO THAT, DO THIS,
[1:14:30] GO HERE, GO THERE." I don't have to tell
[1:14:33] HER WHAT TO DO. SHE LOVES ME AND SHE
[1:14:36] DOES WHAT SHE KNOWS IS PLEASING to this
[1:14:39] guy.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:50] I don't do the things I used to do
[1:14:53] because I love him too much for what
[1:14:56] he's done for me.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; I love him entirely too much to hurt
[1:15:00] him.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; I love him too much to bruise him.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; You know what? You know what, BROTHERS
[1:15:06] AND SISTERS? I'M THE one that put him on
[1:15:08] Calvary in the first place.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; If you're honest, you going to put your
[1:15:13] name there.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; I've put HIM UP THERE ONE TIME.
[1:15:18] I'VE DONE PUT HIM THROUGH TORTURE ONE
[1:15:19] TIME.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; I'VE PUT HIM through beatating one time
[1:15:22] and bruised. And he went AND HE SAID,
[1:15:24] "OKAY, for you
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; for you.
[1:15:35] I'm going to go to Calvary and freely
[1:15:38] give
[1:15:39] myself
[1:15:41] for you.
[1:15:55] One thing in this life I don't want to
[1:15:57] be guilty of is putting him there again.
[1:16:02] I don't want to hurt him. I don't want
[1:16:04] to do nothing that would be displeasing
[1:16:06] to him.
[1:16:11] You say, "Well,
[1:16:13] are you saying you're flawless? You
[1:16:15] don't make mistakes?"
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; I asked my wife if she's flawless or
[1:16:20] makes any mistakes.
[1:16:23] She'll be honest. She'll tell you every
[1:16:26] day. I'm talking about just little maybe
[1:16:29] a little little spad here. I know y'all
[1:16:31] probably don't have those your home.
[1:16:38] Hallelujah.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; But when those things happen, I didn't
[1:16:47] say get out.
[1:16:50] I said, "Let's talk about this." Lord, I
[1:16:54] don't know why I'm going down this hole.
[1:16:59] Let's talk about this.
[1:17:03] And you know, when we go through times
[1:17:05] in our life and maybe we disagree or we
[1:17:07] rebel, might we say, or or have a little
[1:17:09] spat against God, against Jesus himself,
[1:17:13] he don't kick us to the curb,
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; but he says, "Let's talk about this.
[1:17:18] Why don't you visit me in prayer for a
[1:17:20] little while? WHY DON'T YOU LET'S LET'S
[1:17:22] TALK ABOUT THIS AND LET'S see if we
[1:17:24] can't work this situation out." And if
[1:17:26] your heart is something's going on IN
[1:17:27] YOUR LIFE AND YOU'VE GOTTEN HARD ON GOD,
[1:17:29] YOU'VE GOTTEN HARD ON CHURCH, YOU'VE
[1:17:31] GOTTEN HARD on your fellow believers,
[1:17:33] talk it over with God AND SEE IF THAT
[1:17:35] HEART don't begin to get a little bit
[1:17:36] softer and a little more tender and a
[1:17:39] little more welcoming. And then you
[1:17:41] BEGIN TO DRAW YOUR CIRCLE BIGGER AND
[1:17:43] SAY, "HEY, LET'S ALL BE LET'S BE A
[1:17:44] family again."
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're the family of God.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; You see, it's a love affair. Now,
[1:17:59] You know, for 20 years of being around
[1:18:02] this message and and just being a
[1:18:05] Christian, I heard people say, "You
[1:18:06] can't do this. You can't do that. You're
[1:18:10] going to hell if you do this. You're
[1:18:12] going to hell if you do that."
[1:18:16] I thought, man, you think about what I'm
[1:18:18] fixing to say. I thought, man,
[1:18:22] can't nobody live this.
[1:18:29] Can you, brother Troy?
[1:18:32] No. Brother John
[1:18:36] can't do it. You can try to follow all
[1:18:39] the but somewhere you going to lose your
[1:18:40] temper.
[1:18:44] You're going to do something maybe just
[1:18:45] a little sneaky. Then you something's
[1:18:47] going to come to you. Oh, I shouldn't
[1:18:48] have done that.
[1:18:53] But one thing about it, the love that
[1:18:55] you have on the inside,
[1:18:57] it'll bring you right down to the foot
[1:18:59] of Calvary
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, I should not have done
[1:19:03] this. You have taught me better.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE SHOWN ME A BETTER WAY TO LIVE.
[1:19:09] IT'S NOT A OH MY GOODNESS. THINK ABOUT
[1:19:11] WHAT HE DID. HE SHOWED THE DISCIPLES,
[1:19:13] "LOOK, I WANT YOU TO WATCH THE LIFE THAT
[1:19:15] I LIVE, AND YOU MIMIC THE LIFE THAT I
[1:19:19] LIVE. You do the THINGS THE WAY I DO
[1:19:21] THEM. YOU TALK THE WAY I TALK, AND
[1:19:23] YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE."
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was training them
[1:19:31] up for a work. HE WAS TRAINING THEM UP
[1:19:33] FOR A TIME WHEN THE HOLY GHOST WOULD
[1:19:36] COME ON THEM. YES, they had the rules.
[1:19:38] They saw the rules. They saw the letter.
[1:19:40] But when the Holy Ghost came, they
[1:19:42] didn't follow the letter. They lived the
[1:19:44] life.
[1:19:47] We got TO LIVE THE LIFE, brothers and
[1:19:49] sisters.
[1:19:51] Live the life. THE BEST SERMON I'LL EVER
[1:19:53] PREACH IS THE LIFE I LIVE. The best
[1:19:56] life, the the BEST EXAMPLE YOU'LL EVER
[1:19:58] GIVE ANYBODY IS THE way you treat them
[1:20:00] and the life you live before them.
[1:20:05] You see, that's why as believers,
[1:20:07] WE'VE HAD THIS ETERNAL union that has
[1:20:09] taken place between me and my savior.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; It's not between me and my wife. It's
[1:20:15] not between me and my children. It's not
[1:20:17] between me and anybody else.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; But it's between me and my savior.
[1:20:26] And as believers, that's why our lives
[1:20:29] have to be rooted in the word of God.
[1:20:32] And that's why we stand on the promises
[1:20:34] OF GOD. WE'RE TRUSTING IN THE LOVE THAT
[1:20:36] WAS PLACED ON DISPLAY AT CALVARY FOR THE
[1:20:39] ENTIRE world to see.
[1:20:44] This wasn't some hidden show. THIS WAS A
[1:20:48] PUBLIC DISPLAY FOR the entire world to
[1:20:51] see and to know and to experience.
[1:20:57] You see, he loved us so much
[1:21:00] up on that public display for the world
[1:21:02] to see. He loved us so much that he
[1:21:05] said, "I must go,
[1:21:09] but I will not leave you comfortless."
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will not LEAVE YOU
[1:21:15] COMFORTLESS. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THAT
[1:21:17] IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL promises
[1:21:19] from Jesus Christ in John chapter 14 IN
[1:21:21] THE BIBLE BECAUSE IT TELLS US EVEN
[1:21:23] THOUGH HE'S DEPARTED THE WORLD, EVEN
[1:21:25] THOUGH WE can't walk up and shake his
[1:21:27] hands today, even though we can't go
[1:21:29] TALK TO HIM FACE TO FACE and and lip to
[1:21:32] ear, so to speak, BUT HE SAID, "I WILL
[1:21:34] NOT LEAVE YOU. I'm committed to send you
[1:21:37] back the Holy Spirit so that you won't
[1:21:40] be comfortless.
[1:21:46] Hallelujah.
[1:21:48] Not only that, but I'm not just I'm not
[1:21:49] going to leave you. I'm going to send it
[1:21:50] back and I'M GOING TO PUT IT INSIDE of
[1:21:52] you
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; so that YOU CAN FEEL SO THAT YOU CAN
[1:21:56] EXPERIENCE. SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE
[1:21:58] WARMTH AND THE AND THE LOVE THAT I ONCE
[1:22:01] HAD. NOW YOU CAN HAVE IT.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You Why is the capstone love?
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:22:11] When Jesus was on the scene, it was
[1:22:13] about love.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; He loves you so much
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; that he GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN son that
[1:22:20] whosoever
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; should believe.
[1:22:31] In other words,
[1:22:33] he looks down
[1:22:35] and upon the cross and we hear the words
[1:22:38] he says before he gets ready to leave.
[1:22:42] But what he's really trying to say is,
[1:22:44] "My love,
[1:22:47] you're not alone."
[1:22:49] Think about it. My love, you're not
[1:22:51] alone.
[1:22:53] You're not helpless.
[1:22:56] You don't have to be lonely. You don't
[1:22:58] have to BE DEPRESSED. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[1:23:00] BE BOUND BY SIN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
[1:23:02] BOUND by unbelief because I'm going to
[1:23:05] equip you.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to EQUIP YOU WITH AN ENDURING
[1:23:10] PRESENCE THAT WILL LEAD YOU. And I'm
[1:23:12] going to EQUIP YOU WITH A PRESENCE THAT
[1:23:14] WILL GUIDE YOU AND WILL GO BEFORE YOU IN
[1:23:16] YOUR BATTLES that you face.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T FIGHT THIS FIGHT ALONE.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:29] Thank God for the Holy Spirit today.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:41] Why would anybody want to debate the
[1:23:42] works of the Holy Spirit?
[1:23:45] Why would ANYBODY WANT TO SAY THE HOLY
[1:23:47] SPIRIT'S NOT FOR us today?
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:23:51] Why would you want to live a dead
[1:23:53] lifeless Christian life
[1:23:57] when the word Christian itself, as we've
[1:23:59] explained many times, is Christlike?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; How can I act like Christ if he ain't
[1:24:04] leading me?
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; How can I act like Christ? How can I
[1:24:08] treat PEOPLE THE WAY CHRIST WOULD TREAT
[1:24:09] THEM IF I'M NOT BEING LED by something
[1:24:11] that says, "Do just like this."
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Let me TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS. WHAT IT IS.
[1:24:20] and you watch and you tell me if I'm not
[1:24:22] right after service. But let me tell you
[1:24:24] what it is. People who live thinking
[1:24:26] that the Holy Spirit is not for them
[1:24:28] today.
[1:24:31] Hard,
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; miserable,
[1:24:35] defeated.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Miracles are impossible.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; We going to get to it.
[1:24:54] Ephesians
[1:24:56] chapter 3, it says, "Now unto him that
[1:24:59] is able to do exceedingly abundantly
[1:25:01] above all that we ask or think,
[1:25:04] according to the power,"
[1:25:08] can you pull that up, brother, real
[1:25:10] quick? Ephesians chapter 3.
[1:25:15] Now, if you Bible readers and you've
[1:25:16] been you've taken notes and you mark
[1:25:18] your Bibles and you know you know I just
[1:25:20] read that incorrectly.
[1:25:23] I didn't finish the verse.
[1:25:28] We got time. Don't don't rush, brother
[1:25:30] Deon. Chapter 3. There we go.
[1:25:33] I think it's 20. Ephesians 3:20.
[1:25:39] YEAH. NOW UNTO HIM THAT IS ABLE TO DO
[1:25:42] EXCEEDINGLY ABUNDANTLY above all that we
[1:25:44] ask or think according to the power.
[1:25:47] That's where I stopped. But we GOT TO
[1:25:50] UNDERLINE. WE GOT TO HIGHLIGHT. WE GOT
[1:25:52] TO CIRCLE THE NEXT PART. THAT WORKKETH
[1:25:54] in us.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; THAT WORKKETH IN THE BELIEVER THAT
[1:25:59] WORKKETH IN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:26:01] HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE POWER THAT HE'S TALKING
[1:26:04] ABOUT. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THIS IS
[1:26:06] GOD'S ABILITY TO ACT BEYOND HUMAN
[1:26:09] IMAGINATION.
[1:26:15] Beyond human imagination.
[1:26:18] It's his ability to ACT UPON OUR PRAYERS
[1:26:21] AND EXCEED HUMAN EXPECTATIONS.
[1:26:25] YOU SEE, AS HUMAN BEINGS, WE HAVE
[1:26:27] EXPECTATIONS.
[1:26:30] And a lot of times because of things
[1:26:32] we've been through, the life we've been
[1:26:33] dealt, the the the the hand that we've
[1:26:35] had to live, sometimes our expectations
[1:26:38] don't get too high off the ground.
[1:26:42] But that's not what the word says.
[1:26:46] We're standing on the words. WE'RE NOT
[1:26:48] STANDING UP on our experiences that keep
[1:26:50] us down here.
[1:26:52] We're standing up on the word says that
[1:26:53] said it's exceedingly and abundantly
[1:26:55] above all that we ask or think.
[1:27:02] Let me tell you, God is a good God.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; We can't fathom as believers, as
[1:27:07] Christians, WE CAN'T FATHOM THE GOODNESS
[1:27:09] OF GOD AND ALL that he does for us on a
[1:27:12] minute-by-minute basis.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT YOUR HEART
[1:27:16] BEATING, do you?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; It's an involuntary response.
[1:27:22] Love dub loved dub loved dub loved dub
[1:27:26] loved dub.
[1:27:28] You let it stop for a second or two. You
[1:27:31] begin to think real quick.
[1:27:34] Oh Lord.
[1:27:37] YEAH. YOU LET SOME OF THOSE THINGS
[1:27:40] HAPPEN. YOU BEGIN TO THINK real quick.
[1:27:42] But we we we we we just don't hold to
[1:27:44] the highest esteem of all that he does
[1:27:47] in our life. Brothers and sisters, you
[1:27:49] know, I was listening. And I was
[1:27:50] thinking, I hope many of you probably
[1:27:53] listened to brother Ber's service last
[1:27:54] night and he gave the testimony of
[1:27:56] Sister Donna.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; BUT HE BE TO TESTIFY AND HE BE TO tell
[1:28:04] all of the lies that Satan had placed in
[1:28:07] her life.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; It looks like
[1:28:14] Yeah, it looks like you got cancer in
[1:28:16] all your lymph nodes.
[1:28:19] It looks like you've got cancer in your
[1:28:21] bones.
[1:28:22] It looks like you've got cancer in your
[1:28:24] lungs. It looks like you got cancer in
[1:28:27] your breast.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; But what she say,
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; that's what he said.
[1:28:37] But God says,
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS THE PET SCANS ARE CLEAR.
[1:28:48] exceedingly and abundantly above all
[1:28:50] that we can think. In our human being
[1:28:53] thinking, we think that's not possible
[1:28:57] as a human. But as the spirit dwells on
[1:29:00] the inside, oh hallelujah. As the spirit
[1:29:04] dwells and moves on the inside, WE FIND
[1:29:05] OUT THAT IT'S MORE THAN WHAT I THINK.
[1:29:08] IT'S WHAT GOD DOES.
[1:29:10] GOD IS A HEALER. GOD IS A DELIVERER.
[1:29:17] You see, we're going to change gears
[1:29:19] here for just a minute.
[1:29:21] We talked about adoption last Wednesday,
[1:29:23] this past Wednesday, and we thinking
[1:29:25] about adoption. You see, when a family
[1:29:27] goes to an to adopt a child, they go
[1:29:31] into an agreement with an agency.
[1:29:34] They go into an agreement and they and
[1:29:36] they go in there and they ensure that
[1:29:38] agent that they're going to love that
[1:29:40] child.
[1:29:41] I'm going to love that child. I'm gonna
[1:29:44] provide for that child. I'm gonna do
[1:29:46] everything I can for that child. I'm
[1:29:49] going to be here for that child through
[1:29:50] thick and through thin.
[1:29:54] All right.
[1:29:57] They go to adopt that child not out of
[1:30:00] pity.
[1:30:04] Christ didn't go to Calvary out of pity
[1:30:06] for you.
[1:30:08] They don't go to adopt that child out of
[1:30:10] pity or out of obligation.
[1:30:13] But there is A SINCERE DESIRE DOWN in
[1:30:15] their heart to love that child. They
[1:30:19] say, "I'M GOING TO ADOPT THIS CHILD. I'M
[1:30:21] GOING TO LOVE THIS CHILD. I'M going to
[1:30:23] embrace this child just like it's my
[1:30:26] own."
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; That is the process of adoption. And
[1:30:30] when that child, listen now, when that
[1:30:32] child is adopted into the family and it
[1:30:35] becomes one of them,
[1:30:38] that child begins to gain access.
[1:30:41] That child gains access to brothers and
[1:30:44] sisters and grandparents and aunts and
[1:30:47] uncles and cousins.
[1:30:49] Are you with me? And they THEY TAKE THAT
[1:30:53] CHILD AND THEY SAY, "LOOK, here's your
[1:30:55] very own bedroom.
[1:30:57] You have a bed of your own now.
[1:31:01] This is yours."
[1:31:04] Well, is there strings attached? No. No.
[1:31:07] We We want to do this for you. our
[1:31:10] hearts. WELL, IN OUR HEARTS, WE LOVE
[1:31:11] YOU. In our hearts, we want you to be
[1:31:14] part of us.
[1:31:16] This is all yours. They give them A BED.
[1:31:19] THEY GIVE THEM a seat at the family
[1:31:21] table.
[1:31:23] This is your chair, Tommy. God said,
[1:31:25] "This is your chair.
[1:31:30] This is your chair." AND AND AND THEY
[1:31:34] PULL UP AND THEY GIVE THEM EVERY BIT OF
[1:31:35] THAT. This is your own table, A SEAT AT
[1:31:38] THE TABLE. And they even accept you of
[1:31:40] their own by giving you their own family
[1:31:43] name.
[1:31:50] They changed that, right? There's been a
[1:31:53] change. Correct. You go through a legal
[1:31:56] process and say, "I'VE I'VE ADOPTED THIS
[1:31:58] CHILD. WE'RE taking them into our home.
[1:32:00] THEY'RE ONE OF US. NOW, I'M GOING TO
[1:32:02] GIVE THEM MY LAST NAME."
[1:32:07] You ever heard of Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:32:12] Hallelujah.
[1:32:14] But what I want you to know this morning
[1:32:16] in this adoption process, one of the
[1:32:18] most important things that they can do
[1:32:21] is equip that child with a name that
[1:32:24] carries authority.
[1:32:31] Their name once was no good. THEIR NAME
[1:32:34] ONCE WAS A NAME KNOWN IN AN ORPHANAGE.
[1:32:37] Their name once was a name that was lost
[1:32:39] and undone and helpless. BUT WHEN THAT
[1:32:43] CHILD WAS ADOPTED INTO THE FAMILY, THEY
[1:32:45] gave them a name, a new name. AND THAT
[1:32:48] NAME NOW SAYS YOU HAVE POWER AND YOU
[1:32:50] HAVE THE SAME AUTHORITY THAT THE
[1:32:51] FATHER'S name carries.
[1:32:55] So if you NEED TO GO BUY GROCERIES, GO
[1:32:58] BUY GROCERIES. IF YOU NEED GAS IN YOUR
[1:33:01] CAR, CARSON, GO GET GAS IN YOUR CAR.
[1:33:06] It's the same authority
[1:33:10] when you swipe that card.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Here's your debit card, son.
[1:33:17] Swipe it at will. Just kidding.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; But you know what I'm saying? He's
[1:33:27] adopted. He's pulled them in. And what
[1:33:29] is he doing BY GIVING HIM THAT NAME?
[1:33:31] HE'S GIVING HIM EVERYTHING that he has
[1:33:33] need of. and he's equipped him with the
[1:33:35] very same life than the ability to live
[1:33:38] the way he lives.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; So if you say, "I can't live a Christian
[1:33:43] life," you ain't been fully adopted.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; I can't do this. I can't do that. You
[1:33:49] need to go to the adoption agency.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO GET TO THE CROSS. YOU NEED
[1:33:53] TO BE AT THE FOOT OF CALVARY AND SAY,
[1:33:54] "GOD, POUR OUT YOUR LOVE UPON ME. GIVE
[1:33:57] ME THE BLESSINGS, LORD.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; MAKE ME ALL OF YOURS. I WANT A SEAT AT
[1:34:02] THE TABLE.
[1:34:10] You see, anybody who's ever done or
[1:34:12] knows anything about mechanic
[1:34:14] or handiwork and carpentry,
[1:34:18] you know that having the right kind of
[1:34:20] equipment is half the battle.
[1:34:25] Ask Tommy,
[1:34:30] I'm gonna leave you alone today, buddy.
[1:34:33] I'm gonna pick on brother Joe Adams.
[1:34:36] He won't mind. He won't mind if I tell
[1:34:38] you this. He comes up here last week or
[1:34:40] when it was he preached and visits and
[1:34:42] he's like, "I want to do some
[1:34:43] renovations on the house, but I need an
[1:34:46] air compressor. I don't have an air
[1:34:47] compressor. I need I need an air gun. I
[1:34:50] don't I I NEED A CHOPSAW so that I can
[1:34:53] chop this wood up. I want to do some
[1:34:54] trim work."
[1:34:58] So he searches out marketplace and Lord
[1:35:01] blesses him. I'll just tell you.
[1:35:04] He gets a he gets a air compressor
[1:35:08] and he he he gets chopsaw
[1:35:10] and he finds all this stuff here and he
[1:35:12] takes it home and after he's been home
[1:35:15] for a few days and getting away from the
[1:35:16] thoughts of, you know, kind of unwinding
[1:35:18] from preaching so to speak, he sends me
[1:35:22] pictures.
[1:35:24] He's got chair rail up.
[1:35:26] He's got Wayne's coating up. I said, '
[1:35:29] Man, carpentry work, if you're going to
[1:35:32] be a good carpenter, having the right
[1:35:33] tools is half the battle, isn't it? He
[1:35:36] said, "Praise the Lord."
[1:35:39] Cuz let me tell you, I remember when I
[1:35:41] used to try to build with wood and and I
[1:35:43] would take those big old finish nails,
[1:35:45] you know, they're about three and a half
[1:35:46] inches long. They say they're finish
[1:35:47] nails. And you try to drive them into
[1:35:49] wood and what's it do? It splits the
[1:35:51] wood.
[1:35:52] So you tear it out. You have to cut
[1:35:54] another board. You have to start all
[1:35:56] over. Not anymore. IT'S JUST POP POP
[1:35:59] POP. AND IT GOES THROUGH SO FAST AND SO
[1:36:02] QUICK THAT THE WOOD NEVER even knows
[1:36:03] it's been touched.
[1:36:06] The right equipment gets us ready for
[1:36:09] what we have need of in life.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; GOD EQUIPS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US WITH
[1:36:15] EXACTLY what you need tomorrow.
[1:36:20] You think, "I feel so insignificant. I
[1:36:22] feel I feel like I I'm insufficient in
[1:36:24] everything that I want to do." I promise
[1:36:27] you, God has equipped you with
[1:36:30] everything you have need of.
[1:36:35] You know, the having the right equipment
[1:36:37] is essential in any process or or
[1:36:41] progress of any endeavor. Our country
[1:36:44] was founded upon the right equipment.
[1:36:48] Do you realize that our country, the day
[1:36:50] that we live in, the hour that we live
[1:36:52] in, we we we out of the walking to get
[1:36:55] to the grocery store days, and we're out
[1:36:57] of the horse and buggy days. We're out
[1:36:58] of the out of the uh airplane age even.
[1:37:01] We can go somewhere just like that.
[1:37:02] They've got airplanes now that can fly,
[1:37:04] I think it's from uh from uh London to
[1:37:07] California or London to New York in
[1:37:10] about three hours. I think
[1:37:13] I'm not riding on that one. That's the
[1:37:15] government's airplane.
[1:37:20] But you know, equipment has
[1:37:21] revolutionized
[1:37:23] America as the way we know it. We have a
[1:37:25] cotton gin. There was a steam engine.
[1:37:27] Think about this. A light bulb, a
[1:37:28] telephone, an assembly line. They were
[1:37:31] all equipped to do a job. They have uh
[1:37:34] we we we have uh uh infrastructure like
[1:37:37] car uh uh uh roadways and railways, the
[1:37:41] train system.
[1:37:43] Do you realize all this happened within
[1:37:45] a within a span of about a hundred
[1:37:46] years?
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Think about this.
[1:37:51] The right equipment revolutionized the
[1:37:53] world that we know. In 1793,
[1:37:57] did you realize it was that long ago?
[1:37:59] 1793, Eli Whitley Whit Whitney, let me
[1:38:02] get his name right. Give credit where
[1:38:04] credit's due. ELI WHITNEY CREATED THE
[1:38:06] COTTON gin that revolutionized the
[1:38:08] textile world.
[1:38:14] John Deere
[1:38:16] come up with a plow in 1837
[1:38:20] that would change the way people
[1:38:23] cultivated their lands.
[1:38:28] Can you imagine trying to grow enough
[1:38:29] food for the population we have today
[1:38:31] without modern equipment and technology?
[1:38:36] I still wonder where some of this food
[1:38:38] comes from.
[1:38:41] Paul can 3D print a banana.
[1:38:46] Where's our food coming from?
[1:38:52] The telegraph. There was a process for
[1:38:54] making steel and the process for a radio
[1:38:57] and a television, automobiles,
[1:38:59] airplanes.
[1:39:01] Think about all this that's happening
[1:39:02] all so quickly and so rapidly.
[1:39:05] But these inventions, they didn't just
[1:39:07] change industries. They reshaped
[1:39:10] American society, the work that we do,
[1:39:13] the lives we live, daytoday life,
[1:39:16] creating a modern world that we live in.
[1:39:20] But I want you to realize this. YOU SAY,
[1:39:22] "WHY ARE YOU BRINGING THAT IN?" I WANT
[1:39:23] YOU TO REALIZE THIS. I want you to
[1:39:25] realize today that THIS MORNING THAT ALL
[1:39:28] THAT IS WONDERFUL. ALL OF THAT SHAPED
[1:39:30] the world that we live in and MADE IT A
[1:39:32] WORLD FULL OF POSSIBILITIES.
[1:39:35] But long before the cotton gin, long
[1:39:38] before there WAS A RAILROAD, LONG BEFORE
[1:39:41] THERE WAS AN ETHERNET, LONG BEFORE THERE
[1:39:43] WAS AN IPHONE, GOD PLACED SOMETHING on
[1:39:46] the inside of the BELIEVER'S HEART
[1:39:48] CALLED FAITH. F AI T. And if you've got
[1:39:52] that faith this morning, HE SAID, "IF
[1:39:54] THOU CANST only believe,
[1:39:57] ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE." WE'RE NOT
[1:39:59] TALKING ABOUT RAILROADS and airplanes
[1:40:01] and iPhones. I'm talking about healings.
[1:40:04] I'M TALKING ABOUT DELIVERANCE. I'M
[1:40:05] TALKING ABOUT PRODALS COMING HOME. I'M
[1:40:07] TALKING ABOUT babies being healed.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Cancer can't stand before it.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Heart disease CANNOT STAND BEFORE IT.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:20] THAT VERY STATEMENT, IF THOU CAST ONLY
[1:40:22] BELIEVE, all things are possible. What
[1:40:24] does that do for the believer? Brothers
[1:40:26] and sisters, it unlocks ALL THE
[1:40:28] POTENTIALS IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:40:31] It unlocks and it allows YOU TO OVERCOME
[1:40:34] YOUR LIMITATIONS.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; You can have your lost children.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; That's what that statement.
[1:40:48] Let's say that together. If thou canst
[1:40:50] only
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; believe
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; all things are possible.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; All things are possible. Now, do you
[1:41:00] believe it?
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Some of you do. Now, the rest of you say
[1:41:05] it with me this time because not all of
[1:41:06] you did. We're all going to say it or
[1:41:08] we'll stay right here.
[1:41:10] We're going to speak through positive
[1:41:11] confession right here. If thou canst
[1:41:14] only,
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; if only
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; believe
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE,
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; all things are possible.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; YOU JUST UNLOCKED YOUR LIMITATIONS,
[1:41:25] BROTHERS AND SISTERS. YOU JUST SPOKE A
[1:41:27] POSITIVE. YOU JUST SAID, "ANYTHING THAT
[1:41:29] I HAVE NEED OF, GOD CAN DELIVER."
[1:41:32] HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:34] BROTHERS AND SISTERS, GOD ALWAYS EQUIPS
[1:41:37] HIS PEOPLE.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; You look over there and you got these
[1:41:41] big Philistines over there. And brother
[1:41:44] Brandham said there was always a fly in
[1:41:46] the ointment to Israel.
[1:41:48] Might say they're a thorn in their
[1:41:50] flesh.
[1:41:51] And here was those PHILISTINES OVER
[1:41:53] THERE, THE THESE Philistine people over
[1:41:55] there. AND THERE WAS A CHALLENGER OVER
[1:41:56] THERE BY THE NAME of Goliath.
[1:41:59] And the prophet said he was a big
[1:42:01] mammoth. Big fella. They said his
[1:42:05] fingers were 14 in long.
[1:42:12] Yeah. You. Yeah.
[1:42:17] Now listen here.
[1:42:21] This is our gentle giant. Okay.
[1:42:25] But I want you to realize something. I
[1:42:27] got I got pretty average size hands.
[1:42:31] I want you to look at this guy's
[1:42:39] Daniel. Oh, get him. Come here. Get him.
[1:42:42] Let's look at this guy. Put your hand up
[1:42:44] there to his.
[1:42:46] Turn around there where they can see.
[1:42:49] Now turn the other way. We got to see
[1:42:51] his hand. Yours is overshadowing.
[1:42:55] Thank you, buddy. Thank Thank you,
[1:42:57] Carson. Oh, wait. Come here, Carson.
[1:42:59] Come here. Listen one more time. How
[1:43:00] long is that finger? How long is that?
[1:43:05] Yeah. Let's Let's measure that. We
[1:43:07] should have done this at home, but I was
[1:43:08] afraid you wouldn't come. Huh?
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. Four and a half. Four and a half
[1:43:17] inches. And you've seen how it dwarfed
[1:43:19] my hands and Gideon's hands.
[1:43:22] add 10 inches to that.
[1:43:25] This is a 12 inch ruler, right?
[1:43:31] You see, sometimes we talk about a
[1:43:32] giant, but we don't put it into
[1:43:34] perspective.
[1:43:37] This giant of a man that goes over there
[1:43:39] and he begin to talk and he begin to to
[1:43:41] brag and he be to proposition the people
[1:43:44] over there AND THAT'S THE WAY SATAN
[1:43:46] DOES.
[1:43:48] I'M BIGGER THAN YOU. YOU CAN'T overcome
[1:43:52] your habits. You can't overcome drugs.
[1:43:57] YOU CAN'T OVERCOME ALCOHOL. YOU CAN'T
[1:44:00] OVERCOME A lustful spirit. This is WHAT
[1:44:03] HE WAS CRYING ACROSS THE VALLEY. ARE YOU
[1:44:05] WITH ME?
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; I'M A GIANT AND YOU CAN'T defeat me.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's a liar.
[1:44:27] You see, we recognize that. But the
[1:44:30] children of Israel was scared to death.
[1:44:34] Absolutely scared to death. AND THE
[1:44:37] PROPHET SAID THERE, IF THERE WAS ONE man
[1:44:39] in the entire nation of Israel that
[1:44:41] would have been equipped physically
[1:44:44] TO WHOOP THIS GIANT, that man was Saul.
[1:44:50] See, sometimes it's not always what we
[1:44:52] think.
[1:44:54] HE SAID THAT SAUL WAS HEAD AND SHOULDERS
[1:44:56] ABOVE THE ENTIRE ARMY. HE WAS WELL
[1:44:59] TRAINED. He was a master of maneuvering.
[1:45:01] He knew how to handle THE SPEAR. HE KNEW
[1:45:03] HOW TO USE A SHIELD TO KNOCK OFF THE
[1:45:05] DARTS AND KNOCK OFF THE the the the
[1:45:07] swords and knock off the lick of the
[1:45:09] swords. He was the trainer of men.
[1:45:13] He said, "But he being the largest man
[1:45:16] of the nation, the best train that there
[1:45:18] was, he was a coward."
[1:45:27] He said, "But on one day,"
[1:45:31] I said, "On one day."
[1:45:34] On one day, WAY BACK FROM THE BACKSIDE
[1:45:36] OF THE DESERT COME THIS LITTLE RUDDY
[1:45:39] LOOKING DRAWLED UP KNOT CALLED Jesse's
[1:45:41] son, David. HE SAID THIS LITTLE SHEEPKIN
[1:45:45] COAT ON HIM. HE was packing a slingshot
[1:45:47] in his hand.
[1:45:49] H
[1:45:51] I told you God would equip you with
[1:45:53] anything you had need of.
[1:45:57] And here he comes,
[1:46:00] this giant
[1:46:02] on the other side of the valley
[1:46:05] crying out all that he's going to do and
[1:46:07] all he's going to devour and all he's
[1:46:09] GOING TO DESTROY. HE MADE HIS BRAG at
[1:46:11] the wrong time on the wrong day
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; because he was in earshot
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; of a real warrior.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; He was in earshot and he was SITTING
[1:46:22] THERE AND DAVID LOOKED OVER AND HE SAID,
[1:46:24] "YOU MEAN TO TELL ME?"
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE THESE GREAT MEN, THESE
[1:46:30] MEN WHO WERE BATTLE TRAINED soldiers
[1:46:33] standing and listening to that day after
[1:46:36] DAY AFTER DAY? WHY DO WE as Christians
[1:46:38] listen to the devil?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Rise up, David.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Day after day, they're listening to this
[1:46:49] and LISTENING TO THEM DEFY the armies of
[1:46:51] a living God. And this little man,
[1:46:55] this little man,
[1:46:58] little ruddy man,
[1:47:02] takes up the challenge.
[1:47:08] You see, David knew God in a way that
[1:47:10] the entire nation of Israel had never
[1:47:13] experienced.
[1:47:17] It's not how broad your shoulders are.
[1:47:20] It's not about how much money you got.
[1:47:22] It's not about how many people you know
[1:47:24] around the world.
[1:47:28] Come on.
[1:47:32] But what it's about is if you had an
[1:47:34] experience with him.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Have you had an experience with him? You
[1:47:39] see, David may have looked like a boy,
[1:47:41] BUT SAUL WAS TALKING TO A MAN.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; What was he 14? Is that what we've been
[1:47:50] told? I'm right. Am I right, brother?
[1:47:55] 14. Is that right? You've been doing
[1:47:57] this for a long time. Help me out.
[1:48:02] I think that's right. 14. And and and
[1:48:04] and THE PROPHET SAID HE MAY HAVE LOOKED
[1:48:06] like a boy, BUT BUT SAUL WAS TALKING TO
[1:48:08] a man that had experience.
[1:48:11] He knew WHAT IT WAS TO EXPERIENCE GOD IN
[1:48:14] HIS TIME OF NEED. He knew what it was
[1:48:16] like TO EXPERIENCE HAVING TO CALL GOD ON
[1:48:18] THE SCENE IN SITUATIONS THAT WERE
[1:48:20] COMPLETELY OUT of his hands. Come on,
[1:48:23] church. We go through things in life
[1:48:25] THAT ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF OUR HANDS.
[1:48:27] BUT WE HAVE THE ABILITY AS CHILDREN OF
[1:48:29] GOD TO CALL GOD ON THE scene in whatever
[1:48:34] our hour of despair is.
[1:48:41] And he looks at it AND HE SAYS, "SIR,
[1:48:44] I WAS TAKING CARE OF MY DADDY'S SHEEP.
[1:48:49] I'm about my father's business."
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:48:54] WE LIVE EVERY SINGLE DAY OF OUR LIVES
[1:48:56] ABOUT OUR FATHER'S BUSINESS.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE LIVING for your business,
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU'RE LIVING for about your
[1:49:06] father's business,
[1:49:09] that's where it's at. That's where you
[1:49:10] find your overcoming power. AND HE BEGAN
[1:49:12] TO TELL HIM, "ONE DAY BACK THERE, A LION
[1:49:14] CAME IN ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
[1:49:16] AND HE GRABBED ONE OF MY SHEEP AND HE
[1:49:18] RUN OFF WITH IT. AND LET ME TELL YOU
[1:49:20] WHAT I DID. I WENT AND I TOOK MY
[1:49:22] SLINGSHOT.
[1:49:31] Can you imagine this lion running off
[1:49:34] with a lamb in his mouth as hard as he
[1:49:37] could go? David didn't cry.
[1:49:41] David didn't moan.
[1:49:44] David said, "What did God give me?" Oh,
[1:49:48] I got my sling.
[1:49:55] And he said, "I WENT BACK, SAUL, LET ME
[1:49:57] TELL YOU WHAT I DID. I WENT AND AND I
[1:49:59] SNATCHED my lamb back out of his mouth.
[1:50:02] And when that lion got up and tried TO
[1:50:04] RUN OFF, I GRABBED HIM BY THE THROAT AND
[1:50:05] I SLAYED THAT THING."
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; WELL, that was just a fluke, Dave. Uh uh
[1:50:13] David, that was just, you know, don't
[1:50:15] don't get all excited. You got lucky. I
[1:50:18] didn't GET LUCKY BECAUSE IT WASN'T TOO
[1:50:20] LONG AFTER THAT, HERE COME A BEAR AND
[1:50:22] THAT BEAR COME DOWN THERE AND THAT BEAR
[1:50:24] took away one of my lambs and I knocked
[1:50:26] that thing down with a ROCK FROM MY
[1:50:28] SLING. LET ME TELL YOU, GOD HAS GIVEN ME
[1:50:31] THE TOOLS I NEED FOR THE TRADE I LIVE.
[1:50:36] AND AS CHRISTIANS, WE HAVE PRAYER,
[1:50:39] WE HAVE FASTING, WE HAVE DEDICATION
[1:50:42] BEFORE GOD.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't hurt any of us to fast a
[1:50:46] little more.
[1:50:50] You know, they I've been reading
[1:50:54] and they, you know, they
[1:50:57] they say everything,
[1:51:00] but they say when you fast,
[1:51:04] there's an obligation to meet the needs
[1:51:06] you're fasting over.
[1:51:11] But I like to eat.
[1:51:16] It won't kill you
[1:51:20] when you pray.
[1:51:22] Your voice is heard in heavens.
[1:51:26] Your voice is heard. Angels hear. Angels
[1:51:28] respond. Angels report.
[1:51:32] Come on church. So if we will find
[1:51:34] ourselves using the weapons that we
[1:51:36] have,
[1:51:38] PRAYER, FASTING, PRAISE,
[1:51:45] I wasn't going to go here, but I guess I
[1:51:47] will. Here we are.
[1:51:49] You know, when the praises go up, the
[1:51:51] blessings come down.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Have you ever noticed that?
[1:51:56] We go to phenomenal meetings. We have
[1:51:58] phenomenal meetings. Last year here,
[1:52:01] people listened and they heard the word.
[1:52:03] They received the word. They were
[1:52:05] feeding at the table.
[1:52:08] But when did the freedom come?
[1:52:15] What would have happened if we' have
[1:52:17] sang one song and went out the back
[1:52:18] doors?
[1:52:20] You see, we don't we don't allow
[1:52:22] ourselves time to enter into worship and
[1:52:27] to give praise to God for all that he's
[1:52:31] done.
[1:52:33] you know that we don't train ourselves
[1:52:36] to to praise. But let me just tell you,
[1:52:39] if you find yourselves entering into a
[1:52:41] place of praise TO WHERE YOU DON'T CARE
[1:52:43] WHAT YOUR NEIGHBOR THINKS, let me tell
[1:52:45] you, I like to sing, but I can't sing.
[1:52:49] But I don't care what you think.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Well, to a certain degree.
[1:53:00] But when I find myself shut away
[1:53:04] and I'll close my eyes and I don't think
[1:53:07] about the words, but I just let the
[1:53:09] words come
[1:53:11] and I begin to raise my hands AND I
[1:53:13] BEGIN TO PRAISE AND WHILE I'M SINGING, I
[1:53:15] BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT God
[1:53:18] and I BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT WHAT GOD IS
[1:53:20] DOING THROUGH THE SONG AND THROUGH THE
[1:53:22] MUSIC AND I BEGIN TO PRAISE HIM FOR ALL
[1:53:24] HE IS. THERE'S WHEN THE BLESSINGS BEGIN
[1:53:26] TO FLOW. YOU LET A CHURCH SERVICE THAT
[1:53:29] HAS SOME HAS SOME FLOW at it and see if
[1:53:32] the people don't turn loose.
[1:53:34] See if the people don't find some
[1:53:36] freedom.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; But we harness that.
[1:53:43] Why do we harness that?
[1:53:48] Are we embarrassed?
[1:53:51] I don't know. Why do we harness that?
[1:53:54] Why do we Why do we shut that off?
[1:53:57] Well, we've been here for an hour and a
[1:53:59] half. Let me tell you the way I'm
[1:54:01] preaching right now. We can just go for
[1:54:02] about three or four hours
[1:54:04] because that's the way I FEEL IN THE
[1:54:06] PRESENCE THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW.
[1:54:08] NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. TIME DOES NOT
[1:54:10] MATTER WHEN YOU'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF
[1:54:12] GOD.
[1:54:14] And when we BEGIN TO POUR OUT OUR PRAISE
[1:54:16] AND WE BEGIN TO POUR OUT OUR THANKS
[1:54:18] THROUGH SONG AND THROUGH WORSHIP, GOD
[1:54:20] BEGINS TO POUR AND POUR AND POUR AND HE
[1:54:23] OPENS UP THE windows of heaven.
[1:54:27] AND THAT'S WHEN YOU FIND
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE YOU'VE ALLOWED GOD TO COME
[1:54:34] IN. YOU'VE ALLOWED GOD TO WOO OVER THE
[1:54:36] congregation
[1:54:38] and you have caught him on the scene.
[1:54:44] Hallelujah.
[1:54:48] Brothers and sisters, it don't take a
[1:54:50] lot of thinking,
[1:54:51] but what it takes is a humble heart.
[1:54:57] It takes a humble heart. And David looks
[1:55:00] at Saul and he says, "Listen, your
[1:55:03] servant,
[1:55:05] how many servants do we have in here?"
[1:55:08] Amen. If you're not serving, you better
[1:55:10] re-evaluate.
[1:55:14] Living the life of Christ is serving
[1:55:16] others. Am I right?
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; YOUR SERVANT. HE DIDN'T SAY YOUR
[1:55:20] GREATEST WARRIOR,
[1:55:22] the hero of Israel,
[1:55:26] the greatest shepherd,
[1:55:28] but Saul, your servant,
[1:55:31] your servant will go and fight this
[1:55:33] Philistine.
[1:55:35] I'm going to fight him.
[1:55:38] AND OF COURSE, SAUL LOOKS AT HE SAID, "I
[1:55:40] CAN'T LET YOU GO. I can't let you go
[1:55:41] like that, David. YOU'RE BUT A BOY. ALL
[1:55:45] YOU'VE GOT IS A SLINGSHOT. YOU'RE GOING
[1:55:46] TO NEED A LITTLE MORE WEAPONRY.
[1:55:49] Let me give you some equipment.
[1:55:51] Here, come pick out your sword.
[1:55:55] Pick out your shield.
[1:55:58] Pick out your armor. Pick out PICK OUT
[1:56:00] YOUR PICK OUT YOUR your your vest, your
[1:56:02] coat of male.
[1:56:04] You know what I found? I stepped on the
[1:56:06] scales the other day and I found out
[1:56:07] that the armor of God is pretty heavy.
[1:56:12] Some of you got Some of you'll get that.
[1:56:14] Some of you will never get that.
[1:56:18] But here's David.
[1:56:20] I can't do this. I can't stand. I CAN'T
[1:56:23] MOVE LIKE THIS. I CAN'T WALK LIKE THIS.
[1:56:25] I TAKE THIS THING OFF OF ME. I've never
[1:56:28] proved this kind of equipment.
[1:56:34] I HAVE NEVER PUT THIS STUFF ON IN MY
[1:56:36] LIFE. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THIS
[1:56:38] STUFF. But what I do know,
[1:56:43] what I DO KNOW IS WHAT GOD HAS PLACED IN
[1:56:45] MY hand and in my life to defeat every
[1:56:49] enemy that is before me. AND THAT IS
[1:56:51] THIS SLING. AND brothers and sisters,
[1:56:53] FOR US, THAT IS THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:56:59] We need that KIND OF FAITH. WE NEED THAT
[1:57:01] KIND OF EXPERIENCE IN THE RESURRECTED
[1:57:03] JESUS CHRIST OF OUR DAY. BROTHERS and
[1:57:05] sisters, IT'S NOT THEOLOGY. IT'S GOD.
[1:57:08] IT'S GOD AND NEOLOGY. BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:57:10] SAID, he said, "It's neology,
[1:57:15] not theology."
[1:57:18] And he takes this little slingshot.
[1:57:24] He said it was all he knew anything
[1:57:25] about.
[1:57:29] But he knowed that God could use that
[1:57:31] thing for a purpose. and how much it
[1:57:35] meant to save the whole army of Israel
[1:57:43] with a slingshot.
[1:57:47] God equips his people.
[1:57:51] God equips his people. In the Garden of
[1:57:53] Eden, Brother Random says, God, he he
[1:57:56] knew his enemy and and he knew his enemy
[1:57:59] and he knew all of the attacks of his
[1:58:01] enemy. But God being infinite and an
[1:58:03] infinite God that he was, he he knew all
[1:58:06] things before they ever was. Hallelujah.
[1:58:10] If you know all things before they ever
[1:58:11] were, can you be defeated?
[1:58:15] If I read tomorrow's newspaper, I'd be a
[1:58:18] multi-gazillionaire.
[1:58:21] You would, too. Don't tell me you
[1:58:23] wouldn't. Don't look at me like that.
[1:58:26] You'd be looking at that stock market.
[1:58:27] You'd be looking say, "What's up
[1:58:28] tomorrow?"
[1:58:30] cuz I'm going to put it in today.
[1:58:36] But if you knew tomorrow's news today,
[1:58:40] how different WOULD YOU LIVE? AND THAT'S
[1:58:42] THE WAY CHRIST WAS. HE LOOKED AT THAT.
[1:58:44] He could see the end from the beginning.
[1:58:46] And he knew that he would have children
[1:58:48] on this earth, HIS OWN BLESSED CHILDREN.
[1:58:50] HE said that he knew HE WAS GOING TO
[1:58:52] HAVE TO PROVIDE THE BEST for them.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; That's you.
[1:58:59] He could see you.
[1:59:03] He could see your shortcomings. He could
[1:59:06] see your afflictions. He could see your
[1:59:09] failures. He could see even your
[1:59:12] complexes.
[1:59:16] H.
[1:59:20] He said, "But
[1:59:22] he's a father. He's a parent." And he
[1:59:26] said just like any earthly parent and
[1:59:28] parenthood originated in God. He was the
[1:59:30] first parent. He said seeing what Satan
[1:59:32] would do and how he would act, he gave
[1:59:34] his children and provided for them the
[1:59:36] best thing that he could provide for
[1:59:38] them. Knowing the enemy's attack what it
[1:59:41] would be. God fortified. Are you with
[1:59:45] me? He built a fortress around you. And
[1:59:50] he fortified you, his children. He said
[1:59:54] he he's fortified you with with the word
[1:59:57] of God. HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW TO EQUIP his
[2:00:01] people. So if we notice the very first
[2:00:03] thing that God equipped us with in the
[2:00:06] beginning being infinite, he knew what
[2:00:08] it would take to defeat Satan any place,
[2:00:11] anytime, anywhere, on any conditions.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I can't beat him because
[2:00:17] I'M ADDICTED TO THIS. I can't beat him
[2:00:19] because I can't quit looking at this. I
[2:00:21] can't BEAT HIM BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT
[2:00:24] THE WORD SAYS.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; The word of deliverance SAYS THAT GOD
[2:00:29] GAVE YOU THE equipment
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; being INFINITE AND KNOWING WHAT your
[2:00:35] weaknesses were.
[2:00:45] He gave
[2:00:47] the equipment to defeat Satan anytime,
[2:00:49] any place, anywhere, on any condition.
[2:00:51] And he says, "I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM
[2:00:53] something right here."
[2:00:56] And he didn't turn around and say, "But
[2:00:58] I may study this out and give him
[2:01:00] something a little better in a few
[2:01:01] years."
[2:01:03] God don't change. If he could defeat
[2:01:06] Satan in the Garden of Eden, if he could
[2:01:08] defeat Satan in David's time, if he
[2:01:09] could defeat Satan in the in the lion's
[2:01:11] den, if he could defeat Satan in the
[2:01:13] fiery furnace, are you with me?
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; He can defeat Satan today on anything
[2:01:18] that he throws at you. AND HE SAID, "BUT
[2:01:21] GOD IN THE BEGINNING gave his CHILDREN
[2:01:23] AN ATOMIC WEAPON." HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; AN ATOMIC WEAPON. HE SAID it because
[2:01:30] he's an infinite God and he sees that
[2:01:32] there's going to be conflict.
[2:01:35] You're going to have conflict. THERE'S
[2:01:37] GOING TO BE DAYS THE DEVIL is going to
[2:01:39] just whoop you up.
[2:01:45] Anybody tells you he don't, they lying
[2:01:46] to you. You tell that preacher to quit
[2:01:49] lying before he gets in the pit.
[2:01:53] That's what I say.
[2:02:01] But being an infinite God,
[2:02:04] he knows you're going to go into battle.
[2:02:07] And God equipped HIS CHILDREN WITH THE
[2:02:09] RIGHT kind of ammunition, THE RIGHT KIND
[2:02:11] OF ATTACK, THE RIGHT kind of everything
[2:02:13] they had need of. Now listen, THAT WOULD
[2:02:15] SWEEP THEM ALL THE WAY from Eden to the
[2:02:19] rapture.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; You see, it wasn't just overcoming power
[2:02:25] in the garden.
[2:02:27] NOW, IT WASN'T JUST OVERCOMING POWER in
[2:02:29] the lion's den or in the in the fiery
[2:02:31] furnace and those things we've TALKED
[2:02:32] ABOUT. IT'S OVERCOMING POWER IN your
[2:02:34] life, Paul,
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Daniel, Courtney. It's overcoming power
[2:02:39] in your life, young people.
[2:02:42] WELL, JOHN, IT'S OVERCOMING POWER IN
[2:02:43] YOUR LIFE.
[2:02:45] In my life,
[2:02:50] it's overcoming power. the atomic weapon
[2:02:54] that would sweep through all the way
[2:02:56] from Eden to the rapture. AND HE SAID,
[2:02:58] "WHAT WAS IT?"
[2:03:00] It's the word.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD IS WHAT IT WAS. THE WORD
[2:03:05] THAT defeats Satan. It's the word
[2:03:07] that'll feed him anywhere, any place,
[2:03:09] any time, on any condition. And he said,
[2:03:11] "There is no substitute for it.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Don't think you're going to change the
[2:03:19] program.
[2:03:22] Just follow the word.
[2:03:25] Just follow the word. And he said it's
[2:03:28] not WAS IT WASN'T JUST FOR ONE OR TWO OF
[2:03:30] THEM. NO,
[2:03:32] it wasn't just for them back there in
[2:03:34] Sister Becky. It wasn't just for them,
[2:03:37] but it was for everyone. Every believer,
[2:03:40] he said, HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE THE WORD
[2:03:42] AND FIGHT every enemy anywhere that you
[2:03:45] meet him.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm in a place I DON'T EVEN
[2:03:48] KNOW. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF ANYBODY
[2:03:50] CARES. MEET THE ENEMY RIGHT THERE WITH
[2:03:52] THE WORD OF GOD AND SEE IF YOU don't
[2:03:54] win.
[2:03:56] Face any battle YOU HAVE WITH THE WORD
[2:03:58] OF GOD AND SEE. I CHALLENGE YOU, CHURCH
[2:04:02] TO SEE IF YOU'RE NOT VICTORIOUS. YOU
[2:04:04] SAY, "WELL, I can't overcome this." Take
[2:04:06] it to the cross.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Take to the word.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Take it to the WORD AND SAY THAT BY HIS
[2:04:12] STRIPES, I'M HEALED. GOD SAID THAT HE
[2:04:14] WOULD DELIVER ME FROM ANYTHING,
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; any infirmity,
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, that ain't a habit," is
[2:04:21] it? Ain't it? However you want to word
[2:04:24] it.
[2:04:26] Anything that's hindering you, anything
[2:04:27] that's that that is bringing you down,
[2:04:29] anything that is tearing you down,
[2:04:30] that's an enemy. It's an infirmity.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; If you've got a habit that is destroying
[2:04:36] your liver,
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; that's an infirmity being built in your
[2:04:42] body. IF YOU'VE GOT A HABIT THAT'S
[2:04:44] DESTROYING YOUR LUNGS,
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; that's an infirmity that is brewing in
[2:04:49] your body.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; And he can deliver you from those
[2:04:54] things.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Moses,
[2:05:08] we're going to take we're going to hit
[2:05:09] on Moses and then we'll wrap up. Is that
[2:05:11] good? We got time for Moses.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Moses was out there and he he began to
[2:05:16] look and God spoke to Moses as Moses was
[2:05:18] out on the back side of the desert. And
[2:05:21] Moses was back on the back side of the
[2:05:22] desert and and God comes to him and he
[2:05:24] says, "Moses, I have seen the suffering
[2:05:28] of my people and I remembered my
[2:05:30] promise." And Moses says, "Well,
[2:05:32] hallelujah. I'm glad you did." And God
[2:05:34] says, "And I I'm going to send you
[2:05:39] back to where you came from."
[2:05:42] Oh, no,
[2:05:44] no, no, no, no. This ain't the way it's
[2:05:46] going to work, God. You see the
[2:05:47] affliction. You hear their cries. You
[2:05:50] know what they're going through. I'm
[2:05:52] already out of that bondage.
[2:05:55] Are you with me?
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; No. Moses,
[2:05:59] I've equipped you. I've equipped you to
[2:06:03] go and deliver the children in my name.
[2:06:05] I've equipped you to go right through
[2:06:06] there. Moses began to do what a lot of
[2:06:08] us would have done. Complain,
[2:06:12] murmur, and complain. I don't want to
[2:06:15] do, let me tell you. 3:30 this morning
[2:06:17] when my alarm was about to go off, I
[2:06:18] didn't want to do.
[2:06:30] You see, sometimes when we don't want to
[2:06:31] pray, it's just because we don't want to
[2:06:34] do.
[2:06:38] But you know what I did? I did.
[2:06:44] And God is equipped and God has
[2:06:47] answered.
[2:06:49] God is moving. Brothers, I I can't
[2:06:51] preach like this. I I don't have the
[2:06:53] capabilities.
[2:06:55] If you could only see what goes through
[2:06:56] the minds as a preacher's preaching, THE
[2:06:59] RAPID PACE AND the speed that things go
[2:07:01] through. Yes, I've got words ON A PAPER,
[2:07:03] BUT THOUSANDS OF WORDS THAT I'LL SAY ARE
[2:07:06] NEVER ON THIS PAPER.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; And it's because you prayed
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE WE GIVE AND WE GAVE AND GOD
[2:07:14] IS OBLIGATED TO MEET US for to defeat
[2:07:17] enemy at any time, any place, anywhere.
[2:07:21] Satan, you don't have no rights IN THIS
[2:07:22] BUILDING. YOU DON'T HAVE NO RIGHTS IN
[2:07:24] OUR HOME. YOU DON'T HAVE NO RIGHTS in
[2:07:26] our children.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; You're a defeated foe. I'm here to tell
[2:07:34] you this morning.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; And Moses began to complain. And Moses
[2:07:42] didn't want to go. AND FOR 40 YEARS,
[2:07:44] THINK ABOUT THIS. MOSES, and listen the
[2:07:46] way I love the way the prophet says
[2:07:47] this. For 40 years, he was trained in
[2:07:50] Pharaoh's house. He was trained to be uh
[2:07:54] the next ruler in line. He was the most
[2:07:57] theologically sound person.
[2:08:03] BUT HE SAID FIVE MINUTES,
[2:08:06] five minutes surrendered into the
[2:08:09] presence of the fire of God. HE WAS A
[2:08:12] BETTER EQUIPPED than all the equipment
[2:08:14] in the world could ever make him.
[2:08:16] BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE NEED TO TAKE
[2:08:18] FIVE MINUTES IN THE PRESENCE of God AND
[2:08:21] SAY, "GOD, USE ME.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; GOD, CLEAN OUT ANYTHING IN MY LIFE THAT
[2:08:26] IS HINDERING ME FROM DOING WHAT you want
[2:08:27] me to do."
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; FIVE MINUTES. WHAT WHAT WOULD AN HOUR
[2:08:34] DO?
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Are we preaching now? WHAT WOULD AN HOUR
[2:08:39] DO? WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD JUST 30
[2:08:42] MINUTES DO IF YOU GOT IT down on YOUR
[2:08:44] KNEES BEFORE GOD DAY in day out before
[2:08:47] noon before and BEFORE YOU GO TO BED?
[2:08:49] WHAT WOULD 30 MINUTES do if five minutes
[2:08:52] erased all the knowledge?
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; You see, we got to get ourselves out of
[2:08:59] the way.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; And you don't get yourselves out of the
[2:09:02] way by doing what you want to do. You
[2:09:04] get yourself out of the way by getting
[2:09:05] on your knees and doing a little
[2:09:07] neology.
[2:09:10] and say, "God, erase my thinking out of
[2:09:12] the way. God, make me what you would
[2:09:15] have me to be."
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes God
[2:09:24] requires us to do the most ridiculous
[2:09:26] things.
[2:09:36] the most ridiculous things.
[2:09:40] And here comes Moses
[2:09:43] and he runs home
[2:09:46] and grabs Zapora
[2:09:49] and the prophet said he set her a
[2:09:51] straddle of that mule with a kid on each
[2:09:53] hip.
[2:09:55] Now he might be picking his eyeballs up.
[2:10:00] What were we talking about earlier?
[2:10:03] Come on, Sephora. Get the youngans.
[2:10:06] We're going on a journey. How we going?
[2:10:09] You got us a Cadillac. You got us a bus.
[2:10:11] What we got? Get on that mule.
[2:10:14] Where's the kids going to ride? On your
[2:10:16] hip.
[2:10:18] Huh?
[2:10:23] Are you kidding me, Moses? You see, it
[2:10:25] looked ridiculous, didn't it? It looked
[2:10:28] ridiculous into the eyes of even Moses
[2:10:30] and Zapora. They said there he's got him
[2:10:32] up on a mule now. Got her on a mule with
[2:10:34] a kid on each side. And here he is 80
[2:10:36] years old, whiskers blowing in the wind
[2:10:39] with a stick
[2:10:50] with a stick.
[2:10:54] Where are you going, Moses?
[2:10:56] Where are you going, Moses?
[2:10:59] Well, I'll tell you. I'm going down to
[2:11:00] Egypt. I thought you done left that
[2:11:03] place. You said you was never going
[2:11:04] back. You know what? You never say never
[2:11:06] to God.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Woo! You will pay FOR THAT ONE.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; LORD, I'M NEVER GOING TO PREACH AGAIN.
[2:11:15] How many sermons ago was that?
[2:11:19] Never say never. I'm never GOING TO
[2:11:21] SING. YOU MAY be the next lead singer in
[2:11:23] the choir.
[2:11:25] You may be the next song leader.
[2:11:28] WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MOSES? I'M GOING
[2:11:29] DOWN to Egypt.
[2:11:33] Why?
[2:11:35] Don't you know what's going on down
[2:11:37] there? Yeah, I know what's going on.
[2:11:38] I've been there. I've lived it. I know.
[2:11:41] BUT I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THERE AND I'M
[2:11:42] going to take over.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Ha ha. Lol. Smiley face as Tommy sends
[2:11:52] you. Squirting eyes. Squirting eyes.
[2:11:53] squirting eyes.
[2:11:56] It took me forever to figure out what
[2:11:58] she was doing. I was like, "What is
[2:12:00] that?" Then I figured out it's the
[2:12:02] crying and his cries. Anyway,
[2:12:08] you're going to YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHAT,
[2:12:09] MOSES? I'M GOING TO TAKE OVER BECAUSE
[2:12:11] GOD SAID SO.
[2:12:14] GOD TOLD ME THAT I'M GOING TO GO DOWN
[2:12:16] THERE AND TAKE OVER. SEE, IT DON'T MAKE
[2:12:17] A DIFFERENCE OF HOW unreal it seems, how
[2:12:21] ridiculous that it seems, how unfitting
[2:12:24] it seems, how impossible it seems. BUT
[2:12:27] WHEN GOD SAYS IT,
[2:12:30] we believe it AND THAT SETTLES IT. GOD
[2:12:35] MOVES on the scene of his believers. AND
[2:12:38] HE TOLD HIM, "YOU'RE GOING TO GO DOWN
[2:12:39] THERE." AND THEY SAID, "HOW YOU GOING TO
[2:12:41] TAKE OVER? WHAT KIND OF WEAPON you going
[2:12:43] to use?
[2:12:46] A stick.
[2:12:48] A stick. Don't you think, Moses, that's
[2:12:51] a little bit of a weak weapon for what
[2:12:52] you're about to face?
[2:12:56] God said he would equip me.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; You can't even talk, Moses.
[2:13:01] HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SPEAK TO PHARAOH
[2:13:03] WHEN YOU GET ALL nervous up there and
[2:13:04] you begin to sweat in the armpits and
[2:13:06] and he's questioning you these hard
[2:13:08] questions and YOU'RE STANDING BEFORE
[2:13:10] PHARAOH'S COURT? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
[2:13:11] EVEN SPEAK? HE SAID he would give me a
[2:13:13] spokesman.
[2:13:15] Come on, church.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE WOULD PROVIDE MY VOICE. HE
[2:13:19] WOULD PROVIDE A WEAPON. HE WOULD PROVIDE
[2:13:22] everything that I had need of to GET
[2:13:23] THOSE CHILDREN BACK OUT OF THE the the
[2:13:26] garbage pits of Egypt.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; So, if you're living in Egypt
[2:13:34] and you're sucking on garlic and onions,
[2:13:37] it's time to quit eating that
[2:13:40] cuz it stinks.
[2:13:46] Let God equip you. And Moses goes down
[2:13:49] there and he goes down there and it may
[2:13:52] look like it's real insignificant.
[2:13:55] It looks like it's real insignificant
[2:13:57] and and nothing can ever happen, nothing
[2:13:59] can ever come out of it, but when he
[2:14:01] steps before Pharaoh
[2:14:03] and God, I said God begins to prove
[2:14:08] himself.
[2:14:11] One plague.
[2:14:13] Oh, you don't ain't enough to convince
[2:14:15] you, Pharaoh? Two plagues. Oh, you still
[2:14:18] don't believe I'm real? Three plagues.
[2:14:21] Four, five, six.
[2:14:24] How many was it, Brother Troy? You a
[2:14:26] theologian?
[2:14:28] 10. That's what I thought.
[2:14:33] 10.
[2:14:35] Do you believe me now that your son's
[2:14:37] laying dead?
[2:14:39] Do you believe me now that Moses was my
[2:14:42] spokesman? Do you believe me now when
[2:14:45] that stick that he was that he was
[2:14:47] packing went down and swallowed up the
[2:14:49] very serpents that you had? DO YOU
[2:14:51] BELIEVE ME NOW, PHARAOH?
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; How many of us this morning could look
[2:14:57] and we need to say we need to get before
[2:14:58] we need to get before Satan and say, "DO
[2:15:00] YOU BELIEVE ME NOW, SATAN? I DON'T FALL
[2:15:03] to your ws no more
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; because IN THIS HOUR I'VE BEEN MADE MORE
[2:15:08] THAN A CONQUEROR. I'VE TAKEN over
[2:15:11] everything that you took away from me.
[2:15:18] I thought about that song Brother Andrew
[2:15:20] sang last night. I went to the enemy
[2:15:23] camp and I took back what he stole from
[2:15:26] me.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; I thought that's what we got to do. God
[2:15:32] has equipped us with the ability to take
[2:15:35] back. If you've lost your joy,
[2:15:39] take it back. If you've lost your love
[2:15:42] for for your brotherhood,
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; take it back.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, ain't nobody friendly TO
[2:15:48] ME." SHOW YOURSELF FRIENDLY.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; You know, I found out the hard way.
[2:15:52] That's the way it work. I think ain't
[2:15:53] nobody loved me for years, but it was me
[2:15:55] that was a stuck up, stubborn snoot.
[2:15:59] Hey,
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; but it's the truth. BUT WHEN I STARTED
[2:16:08] FINDING MYSELF BEING FRIENDLY,
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; God will Oh, God will move on the scene.
[2:16:17] If you need more love, show love to
[2:16:19] somebody.
[2:16:25] If you
[2:16:27] Here we go.
[2:16:28] If you need more money,
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; give a little bit to somebody.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Pay your tithe. Pay your offering.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; Give a little extra on the tip when you
[2:16:39] really ain't got it to give. And see
[2:16:40] what happens.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; See what happens. I challenge you.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; My wife, Lord, I love her with
[2:16:50] everything in me,
[2:16:53] but she thinks a $2 tip sometimes is too
[2:16:55] much.
[2:17:01] I said, "I'm not doing that.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; They working hard and they don't get
[2:17:06] paid nothing. If they take care of me,
[2:17:08] I'm going to take care of them."
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; So, I kind of set it in my mind, you
[2:17:12] know, they say, "Well, 10% then somebody
[2:17:15] said 10%'s good for Jesus. It's good for
[2:17:17] the waiter."
[2:17:22] If I go in and I eat a $10 meal and I
[2:17:24] give 10%, what is that?
[2:17:27] Who said that over here? You start, boy.
[2:17:35] A dollar. Yeah. I don't know why we're
[2:17:38] going this way, but we're going. If you
[2:17:40] need to to be blessed, bless somebody. I
[2:17:44] made it. I made it kind of a little
[2:17:46] thing in my mind. I thought if I can't
[2:17:47] give 25% to the waiter, the waitress for
[2:17:50] the meal that I get, I don't need to be
[2:17:52] spending money to eat out.
[2:17:59] And you know what happened? The funny
[2:18:00] thing happened.
[2:18:02] I go back to those restaurants now. I
[2:18:05] never run out of chips.
[2:18:09] I never run out of salsa. I never run
[2:18:12] out of Coke. Zero. Bring it on. Bring it
[2:18:14] on. Would you like anything else, sir?
[2:18:18] No, I think I'm good. Are you sure? Do
[2:18:19] you want me to top off your drink? No, I
[2:18:21] think I'm okay. I'll bring you some if
[2:18:23] you want it.
[2:18:26] You see what I'm saying? If you want to
[2:18:27] be blessed, bless others. You want to
[2:18:29] see I if you if you want to see your
[2:18:32] life be fulfilled, be fulfilling to
[2:18:34] others.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; God equips his people. God equipped
[2:18:40] Moses to be a leader. God equipped
[2:18:43] Joshua with a vision. God equipped
[2:18:46] Esther and gave her courage.
[2:18:49] God equipped Daniel and gave him an
[2:18:51] equipment to interpret dreams that would
[2:18:54] change the world history.
[2:19:00] He gave Paul, this is one we don't like.
[2:19:03] He gave Paul the ability, the equipment
[2:19:06] to endure trials and training.
[2:19:10] I got I got that mastered.
[2:19:17] What I'm trying to get to us this
[2:19:19] morning, Abraham's seed.
[2:19:23] Abraham's seed. It's not about you. It's
[2:19:25] not about me. It's not about a lineage,
[2:19:28] but it's about being in Christ. It's
[2:19:31] about being in Christ and letting God
[2:19:33] equip you with what you have need of.
[2:19:35] Sometimes he'll use your weakness.
[2:19:37] Sometimes he'll useh provisions. He'll
[2:19:40] give you a skill. He'll give you a
[2:19:41] resource. He'll give you a way to
[2:19:43] complete some task.
[2:19:49] Sometimes he uses transformation.
[2:19:53] He said, "I know you guys are fishermen,
[2:19:56] but if you'll come and follow me, I'll
[2:19:57] make you fishers of men.
[2:20:02] Get rid of this stinky mess we're in.
[2:20:05] Who wants to go around smelling like
[2:20:07] fish all day? Let's go save some souls,
[2:20:10] brothers." Amen.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Hey, the power of transformation.
[2:20:18] Hallelujah. Let's stand to our feet. We
[2:20:21] got to find a place to stop.
[2:20:23] Musicians, if you'll come.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:31] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise the
[2:20:33] Lord.
[2:20:35] God is good.
[2:20:38] You know, Jesus, Jesus's death was the
[2:20:42] greatest equiptor of believers the world
[2:20:45] has ever known. Because upon that death
[2:20:48] on Calvary,
[2:20:50] there was an offering. There was an
[2:20:51] atonement made for your sins, for your
[2:20:54] shortcomings, for your failures. There
[2:20:56] was an atonement made. And in that
[2:20:58] atonement, there was a purifying that
[2:21:00] took place that said, "I take away all
[2:21:02] of sin's powers.
[2:21:05] I take away all of sin's powers and now
[2:21:08] we're going to defeat death, hell, the
[2:21:10] grave and devil and anything he throws
[2:21:13] at you. That's what the empowerment and
[2:21:16] that's what the equipping of the the
[2:21:19] cross of Calvary and the bloodshed of
[2:21:21] Jesus Christ did for you and I. Aren't
[2:21:23] you thankful for that this morning? That
[2:21:25] it gives you the power of freedom OVER
[2:21:28] SIN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BOUND BY THE
[2:21:30] THINGS THAT USED to bind you. Just lay
[2:21:32] it down.
[2:21:34] lay it down and speak the word OVER IT.
[2:21:36] THAT IS THAT IS WHAT GOD DID AT CALVARY.
[2:21:38] IT IT broke the legal hold the laws
[2:21:43] because before faith came
[2:21:46] but after faith came the laws were
[2:21:49] broken. You can have your deliverance.
[2:21:52] You can have all those things. That's
[2:21:54] what Jesus did. Jesus on the cross, he
[2:21:56] gave us healing. It gave us peace. It
[2:21:58] gave us righteousness. And most
[2:21:59] importantly, it gave us the Holy Ghost.
[2:22:03] Amen.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[2:22:05] Father, we thank you for this day, for
[2:22:06] your blessings, for your love. Lord, we
[2:22:09] thank you for stepping on the scene this
[2:22:11] morning. We thank you for the prayers of
[2:22:13] the saints this morning, Lord. Lord, we
[2:22:15] certainly felt their their pull and and
[2:22:17] their their their dedication and prayer
[2:22:19] for our service today. Lord, we thank
[2:22:21] you for for moving in the hearts of your
[2:22:23] believers and encouraging us, lifting us
[2:22:26] up, teaching us through the word, and
[2:22:28] inspiring us
[2:22:31] with the equipment to get through this
[2:22:33] day. We thank you, Lord, for all you do
[2:22:35] for us, Lord. We want to give you
[2:22:37] praise. We want to give you honor. We
[2:22:39] want to give you glory. And Lord, as we
[2:22:42] do that, we come before you with humble
[2:22:44] hearts this morning.
[2:22:46] And Lord, as we pray and and all eyes
[2:22:49] are closed and we're not looking around,
[2:22:51] we're we're focusing on oursel this
[2:22:53] morning. And if there's anybody here
[2:22:55] that would just just say, you know, I
[2:22:57] I've been struggling with this in my
[2:22:58] life and I've been struggling maybe over
[2:23:00] here and and I've been wandering into
[2:23:02] into places I shouldn't go in my life
[2:23:05] and I I haven't quite been that real
[2:23:07] example that I should have been. And you
[2:23:09] just want to raise your hand up and say,
[2:23:10] "God, forgive me. I repent of my

[2:32:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:32:42] We're certainly in a season of blessing
[2:32:43] and God is so good to us and
[2:32:48] you know and
[2:32:50] we just given a note here and
[2:32:53] very very serious and sad situation that
[2:32:57] was just handed to me and you hate to
[2:33:00] have to deliver a message like this but
[2:33:02] this family needs prayers. This is from
[2:33:04] brother Devin says, "Please pray for my
[2:33:07] former co-worker's family.
[2:33:10] The 9-year-old daughter found her
[2:33:12] 14-year-old sister who had committed
[2:33:14] suicide this morning.
[2:33:19] That's a tough situation.
[2:33:26] I don't know this person. You don't know
[2:33:28] this person.
[2:33:30] But I can't imagine what that family
[2:33:32] must be feeling in this hour.
[2:33:36] Especially the 9-year-old.
[2:33:40] It's found her sister in this situation.
[2:33:47] So, let's just go before the Lord and
[2:33:49] ask that the Lord would be with them at
[2:33:51] this time. Heavenly Father,
[2:33:55] there's things in life that we just
[2:33:58] completely have to be honest and say we
[2:34:00] don't understand.
[2:34:05] But what we know is that the enemy is
[2:34:06] real.
[2:34:08] The enemy is real in the hour that we
[2:34:11] are living in and he's no respector of
[2:34:14] person.
[2:34:17] No doubt this something has caused this
[2:34:22] young lady of 14, just a just a mere
[2:34:26] young child, Lord,
[2:34:30] to feel like for some reason life wasn't
[2:34:32] worth living.
[2:34:37] We thank you Lord for allowing us to
[2:34:43] be appreciative in life itself. But
[2:34:46] Lord, Satan had pulled the wool over her
[2:34:48] eyes. No doubt because a child of 14
[2:34:51] just in her youth,
[2:34:54] she had so much to live for, it would
[2:34:57] appear. But something had caused the
[2:35:00] distress
[2:35:03] and influenced her to commit an act that
[2:35:09] you just hate to hear, Lord.
[2:35:13] So Lord, we just pray this morning for
[2:35:15] the family.
[2:35:18] There's a mother and a father that's
[2:35:20] grieving and
[2:35:22] no doubt questioning why.
[2:35:25] What happened? What could we have done?
[2:35:28] There'll be many, many, many questions
[2:35:30] that go through their minds in the days
[2:35:32] to come, in the weeks and even years.
[2:35:34] Lord, I don't know if a person would
[2:35:36] ever get over it
[2:35:38] on this side, Lord.
[2:35:41] Lord, my heart breaks for that little
[2:35:42] girl that found her sister in that
[2:35:44] condition, Lord.
[2:35:48] And Lord, I just ask this morning, Lord,
[2:35:50] that you would go and you would comfort
[2:35:51] her.
[2:35:55] Don't ever let her think she was at
[2:35:57] fault or that she failed in some way
[2:36:01] because it's a hard load that she'll
[2:36:03] have to carry and a burden she'll bear.
[2:36:07] But Lord, we ask Lord that you will be
[2:36:09] her burden bearer this morning.
[2:36:12] May she find peace and solace in you,
[2:36:14] Lord.
[2:36:17] If she don't know you, may may she find
[2:36:19] you through this, Lord, and the family,
[2:36:21] Lord.
[2:36:24] We commit it into your hands, Lord,
[2:36:25] asking that you would just move in a
[2:36:27] mighty way on this scene.
[2:36:30] We commit it to you trusting and
[2:36:32] believing
[2:36:34] that you'll handle the situation
[2:36:36] in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:36:40] Amen. Brother David, if you've got a
[2:36:42] couple psalms or a song,
[2:36:56] the goodness of God this morning. I love
[2:36:59] you, Lord,
[2:37:03] for your mercy never fails me.
[2:37:08] And all my days
[2:37:11] I've been held in your hand.
[2:37:16] From the moment that I wake up
[2:37:21] till I lay my head,
[2:37:25] I rule
[2:37:28] in the goodness
[2:37:30] of God.
[2:37:35] For all my life you have been faithful.
[2:37:39] Yes, Lord.
[2:37:43] And all my life you have been so so
[2:37:48] good.
[2:37:51] With every breath that I am able,
[2:37:57] I will sing of the goodness
[2:38:01] of God.
[2:38:04] I love your voice.
[2:38:09] You have led me through the fire
[2:38:14] in darkness night. You are close like no
[2:38:19] other.
[2:38:22] I've known you as a father.
[2:38:26] I've known you as a friend.
[2:38:30] And I will sing in the goodness
[2:38:34] of God.
[2:38:39] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:38:47] And all my life you have been so so
[2:38:52] good.
[2:38:54] With every breath that
[2:39:01] I will sing of the goodness
[2:39:05] for all my life
[2:39:10] and all my life you have been faithful.
[2:39:14] Yes, Lord.
[2:39:17] And all my life you have been so so
[2:39:22] good.
[2:39:25] With every breath that I am aable,
[2:39:31] I will sing
[2:39:33] of the goodness of God.
[2:39:38] And I will sing of the goodness
[2:39:43] of God.
[2:39:45] I love this song. My hope is in the
[2:39:48] Lord. Let's sing that before we go this
[2:39:50] morning.
[2:39:51] My hope
[2:39:55] is in the Lord
