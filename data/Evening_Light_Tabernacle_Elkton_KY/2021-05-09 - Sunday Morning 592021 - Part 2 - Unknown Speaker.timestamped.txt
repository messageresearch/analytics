[0:34] knowledge skills and abilities to make
[0:36] them competent as a human being
[0:39] a mother is probably the hardest
[0:43] yet most rewarding job in the world
[0:48] i was thinking the other day you know

[0:57] like to be a mother
[0:58] and i there's no way that i could feel

[1:12] cooking
[1:24] i'm gonna tell you face it raising jesus
[1:26] was not an easy
[1:34] we're talking about a child that ran off
[1:40] yeah yeah this is a child about 12 years
[1:42] old and his mom and dad say hey we're
[1:44] going to go to the market
[1:45] you stay right here you look at the
[1:46] lambs you look at the doves you stay
[1:48] right
[1:49] right there we'll be back in 15 minutes
[1:52] don't go nowhere
[1:53] scour the city in and out here and there
[1:55] in buildings out of buildings and
[1:56] they're in a panic and frantic worry is
[1:58] jesus where's our son
[2:01] and then they find him over in the
[2:03] temple and he's preaching
[2:06] and what does he do but say hurtful
[2:07] things to his mom
[2:11] he says hurtful things and things to
[2:13] belittle her and he acts in such a way
[2:15] that they thought he was mad
[2:20] mary was just like every other mother
[2:22] you want to be proud of your children
[2:24] you want you want to be able to to put
[2:26] your children out there and you want to
[2:27] be an upstanding young man young lady
[2:29] and you want the people to speak highly
[2:30] of your children sure you do your
[2:32] mothers that's what
[2:33] you do but no not jesus
[2:37] not jesus we begin to look at it and all
[2:39] through his life at the very beginning
[2:41] of his ministry what did he do but
[2:42] offend people in the synagogue
[2:46] whose child is this it's that carpenter
[2:51] and a woman you know that carpenter and
[2:53] that woman said she
[2:54] had a she was a virgin and she conceived
[2:57] whose son is this and he's standing and
[2:58] he's continually upsetting the pharisees
[3:01] over and over and over to the point that
[3:02] mary is says
[3:04] and and luke i think it is uh or no i'm
[3:06] sorry it's a mark
[3:07] where she says he heard about this and
[3:09] they went to take charge of him because
[3:10] they thought he was out of his mind
[3:14] mary and the other siblings are going to
[3:15] fight him what are you doing
[3:17] why are you upsetting these people all
[3:19] the time why are you embarrassing us
[3:24] and jesus said this
[3:27] i didn't come to bring peace
[3:32] i didn't come to bring peace but i
[3:34] brought a sword
[3:35] i've come to turn man against his father
[3:37] daughter against his mother daughter and
[3:38] all against mother-in-law
[3:40] and man's enemy will be the members of
[3:41] his own household
[3:43] how do you think that made her
[3:47] feel
[3:51] my son's a renegade
[3:54] we know we know what jesus was doing we
[3:56] know the end of the story
[3:57] but think through the mind of mary
[3:59] you're the mother and this is your child
[4:01] this is what's going on and brothers and
[4:02] sisters jesus didn't care
[4:04] if that blood was family or not
[4:09] exodus said honor your mother and father
[4:11] and jesus said who is my mother
[4:15] who are my brothers and he looks out
[4:17] amongst the crowd he said you'll know my
[4:18] mother and brothers and father is
[4:20] right there anybody that does the will
[4:24] of my father
[4:24] you're my brother you're my sister
[4:26] you're my mother
[4:29] how hurt how hurt
[4:33] should could she have been can you
[4:35] imagine i may be angry
[4:39] how could you do this jesus how could
[4:41] you say such words how could you hurt me
[4:43] like that
[4:45] think about mary now and jesus and mary
[4:48] they're at the disciples wedding
[4:50] at a wedding with the disciples and mary
[4:52] runs and tells jesus
[4:53] the host is out of wine the host is out
[4:57] of wine jesus
[4:58] and mary knowing his ability she knows
[5:00] that jesus can
[5:02] do miracle after remember she's seen it
[5:04] behind the scenes she knows what he's
[5:05] capable of
[5:06] and so obviously she wants him to step
[5:08] up and do something out of the ordinary
[5:11] and produce all of this wine
[5:14] show us what you can do jesus and what's
[5:16] he saying woman
[5:22] woman what does this have to do with
[5:27] me it's not my time yet
[5:30] now let me tell you something brother
[5:31] and sister i don't know about you but if
[5:33] i looked at my mom i said
[5:34] woman i'd be picking up my teeth
[5:40] my grandmother my mother no and he says
[5:43] woman
[5:43] what does this have to do with me i
[5:46] can't help but think what mary's
[5:48] thinking at this point in her life
[5:51] let me tell you something boy
[5:54] at 13 years old i carried you in
[5:58] my one at 13 years old i walked up and
[6:02] down the hillsides of judea while i was
[6:04] pregnant
[6:04] at 13 years old i gave birth to you in a
[6:07] stable i worked my fingers to a bone i
[6:09] traveled five days every year to get the
[6:12] appointing
[6:13] anointing upon you and this is the way
[6:16] you repay me
[6:17] all you can say is woman
[6:23] can you imagine that stare
[6:27] all your mothers have that stare you
[6:29] don't have to say a word
[6:31] it's all right here you know
[6:36] as a child you don't have to you don't
[6:37] have to ask what's wrong
[6:39] you know something's wrong because that
[6:41] stare comes so i can imagine
[6:43] now staring through jesus how
[6:45] embarrassed she must have been in this
[6:47] house full of people
[6:50] but a mother's love endures a mother's
[6:53] love endures first corinthians 13 says
[6:55] love endures all things
[6:58] it beareth all things believeth all
[6:59] things hopeth all things endureth all
[7:01] things
[7:04] love doesn't give up love doesn't give
[7:08] up
[7:08] it doesn't give up on a person love
[7:12] because of love it willingly remains it
[7:14] stands firm no matter how difficult the
[7:16] situation
[7:21] you know motherhood and parenting
[7:23] bringing the fathers in here a little
[7:25] bit
[7:26] it can be tough it causes you to have to
[7:29] suffer
[7:30] sometimes
[7:33] you know as a parent sometimes you go
[7:35] through seasons of life
[7:37] seasons of suffering whether it be a
[7:39] child's sickness
[7:42] you hate to see your children sick your
[7:44] mothers you hate to see your children
[7:46] sick
[7:47] there's mothers that have long-term kids
[7:48] that have long-term needs
[7:51] and disabilities they carry that their
[7:54] whole life
[7:56] there's mothers that have heart ache and
[7:58] brokenness because they know
[8:00] what's at the end of the road i can't
[8:03] imagine
[8:06] a mom of the little one she endures
[8:09] she walks the children through difficult
[8:11] seasons
[8:13] they hold their hand they cry
[8:17] when the love when the child is hurt
[8:19] they hurt
[8:20] when the kid loses their best friend
[8:23] they cry with mama
[8:24] when a child loses their dog they cry
[8:26] with mama
[8:28] it's my hand that nurtures and pulls a
[8:30] man and takes care and pulls them in
[8:32] close and tight
[8:35] love of a mother is a love that endures
[8:37] continues well after the child leaves
[8:39] home
[8:42] those of you whose children have married
[8:44] and gone off
[8:45] you didn't quit loving you still think
[8:48] about them every single
[8:50] day
[8:53] no matter what road they go down your
[8:55] mother is thinking
[8:56] about you enduring love love without
[9:00] resentment
[9:02] from teething to tantrums
[9:08] to teaching to trials enduring love is
[9:11] committed to a lifelong enduring love it
[9:13] realizes that parenting
[9:15] is a lifelong relationship and that the
[9:17] mother with enduring love
[9:18] can walk alongside her child through all
[9:22] difficult seasons
[9:26] sometimes when you're in those teenage
[9:28] years
[9:30] you think you don't need mama you think
[9:33] you don't need daddy you think you don't
[9:34] need mama
[9:36] as soon as something goes wrong
[9:39] who's the first person you go to
[9:42] mama enduring love trust
[9:48] in god's promises enduring love trust
[9:51] and faith
[9:52] that god's sovereign goodness where god
[9:55] makes no guarantees what a love what a
[9:57] love that that is
[9:58] what a love that mary had enduring love
[10:05] as we read through the chapter 19 of
[10:07] john
[10:10] if you want to follow along i want you
[10:12] to envision you're at that scene
[10:15] through the eyes of mary the mother of
[10:18] jesus
[10:20] and you're at that scene
[10:23] and pilate therefore took jesus
[10:29] and scored him
[10:32] and the soldier plated a crown of thorns
[10:34] and put it on his head and put a purple
[10:35] robe and said hail
[10:38] king of the jews remember last time mary
[10:41] heard that it was hell
[10:43] god's found favor now it's hell
[10:47] king of the jews and they smote him with
[10:50] their hands
[10:51] and pilate went forth and to bring him
[10:53] forth and to find no fault in him but
[10:55] jesus came forth wearing a crown of
[10:57] thorns a purple robe and pilate said
[10:59] behold the man
[11:02] the chief priests therefore the officer
[11:04] saw him they cried out crying crucifying
[11:06] crucifying
[11:09] can you imagine mary at that scene can
[11:12] you imagine mary there and you're
[11:13] watching your son
[11:15] be scourged you're watching them people
[11:17] cry out crucifying crucify
[11:19] and you've seen miracle after miracle
[11:21] after miracle even when jesus
[11:23] said woman what does this have to do
[11:27] with me
[11:27] he filled six vats of wine
[11:33] the chief priest and officer saw him
[11:34] they cried out crucified by
[11:37] him crucify him
[11:40] take him away and crucify him
[11:44] jesus answer said we have a law
[11:48] and by our law he ought to die and the
[11:50] jews answered him sorry
[11:51] we have a law in our law he ought to die
[11:53] because he's made himself the son of god
[12:00] pilate therefore heard him saying he was
[12:03] the moore for
[12:04] afraid and he went into the judgment
[12:06] hall and saith unto jesus
[12:08] whence art thou jesus gave no answer
[12:13] then saith paul speaketh thou not unto
[12:15] me knoweth thou
[12:17] not that i have power to crucify thee
[12:18] and i have power to release thee
[12:20] and jesus answered and said goodness
[12:22] thou have no power at all against me
[12:23] except they were given to thee from
[12:25] above
[12:28] and mary's hearing all this
[12:32] mary is beginning to realize exactly who
[12:35] she was
[12:37] she's beginning to realize that she
[12:38] carried the first miracle
[12:40] onto the face of the earth and she's
[12:42] hearing this and and then pilates
[12:44] overheard them saying and brought jesus
[12:45] forth and sat down in the judgment seat
[12:47] in a place called
[12:48] the payment and but the hebrew gabitha
[12:52] and it was a preparation of the past
[12:54] it's over in the sixth hour
[12:55] and saith the jews behold your king and
[12:57] that cried out away with him away with
[12:59] him
[13:01] crucify him
[13:05] skipping on down a little bit
[13:10] and he bearing his cross went forth to a
[13:13] place
[13:13] called of the skull which is called in
[13:17] hebrew
[13:18] golgotha where they crucified him
[13:21] and two others with him one on either
[13:23] side and jesus in the midst
[13:33] verse 23
[13:36] then the soldiers this is where it
[13:39] starts to get
[13:40] real then the soldiers when they had
[13:43] crucified jesus they took his garments
[13:46] and made four parts and to every soldier
[13:48] apart and also his coat now the coat was
[13:50] without seen woven from top throughout
[13:52] and they said them therefore amongst
[13:54] themselves let us not rent it but cast
[13:55] lots for it
[13:57] whos whose it shall be and the scripture
[13:59] might be fulfilled
[14:00] they that part of my raymond among them
[14:02] for my vesture they did cast lots
[14:05] these things therefore the soldiers did
[14:08] jesus is going through the most
[14:10] horrendous time of his life he's been
[14:12] scored he's been mocked he's been spit
[14:14] on he's wearing a crown of thorns he's
[14:15] been made a mockery of
[14:17] and he's carried the cross all the way
[14:19] up to galgotha
[14:20] colump columbus as that cross hits the
[14:22] ground and what's the next one saying
[14:25] now there stood by the cross of jesus
[14:30] his mother if that don't rip your heart
[14:34] out you don't have one
[14:38] there stood at the foot of the cross
[14:41] jesus
[14:42] his mother
[14:47] and his mother sister mary the wife of
[14:49] cleophas and mary magdalene
[14:52] watch now when jesus therefore saw his
[14:55] mother
[14:56] and the disciples standing by whom he
[14:58] loved
[14:59] he saith unto his mother woman
[15:04] behold thy son it's a different
[15:07] interpretation here
[15:10] it's not woman
[15:14] this what does this have to do with me
[15:15] that's not this interpretation but now
[15:18] he's looking down
[15:19] and he says woman that's to say ma'am
[15:24] here is your son this is what my work
[15:27] was for
[15:29] this is what you carried me for
[15:32] when the angel gabriel come to you and
[15:34] said hell
[15:38] this is what it was for it was so that
[15:42] the world
[15:43] could live
[15:46] i'm dying a sinner's death mom
[15:52] what a cross she bore
[15:56] what a cross she bore it says then the
[15:59] disciples said behold thy mother
[16:01] and they took her in to his own home
[16:07] what a scene
[16:10] what a scene mary
[16:13] was the only person to be present with
[16:16] jesus at his birth
[16:18] and at his death
[16:22] joseph was he had died according to
[16:26] theology scripture he found anywhere
[16:28] account of luke
[16:30] mary a single mother
[16:34] at the foot of the cross mother
[16:38] this is who i am
[16:45] by these words i think we can look now
[16:46] and say that jesus deeply cared
[16:50] for his mother jesus deeply cared and
[16:54] and cared personally for his mother
[16:57] mary there was a witness of jesus's last
[17:00] hours on
[17:02] earth she was probably close to 50 years
[17:04] old at that time
[17:08] what torture that must have been in
[17:10] mary's heart
[17:13] what torture that must have been on mary
[17:16] and i wonder whether the angels were
[17:18] from three three decades earlier
[17:20] earlier
[17:23] did they haunt her or did they comfort
[17:30] her
[17:32] remember mary she said am i that one
[17:36] am i that one that's going to birth a
[17:39] governor
[17:40] of the world am i the one that's that's
[17:42] going to birth
[17:43] the one that takes away all the all the
[17:45] sickness of the world
[17:46] the sin of the world am i that one
[17:50] a virgin sal conceive
[17:53] she was the one she didn't know all the
[17:56] heartaches
[17:57] she didn't know all the disappointments
[18:00] she didn't know the cross that she was
[18:02] going to have to bear
[18:05] but she picked up her cross and followed
[18:08] jesus
[18:12] you think well that's where the story
[18:13] ends but really it doesn't
[18:16] jesus died who was at the tomb
[18:19] mary mary magdalene and mary
[18:26] was that where it died is that where it
[18:27] stopped is that where it all ended is
[18:28] that where mary gave up on jesus when he
[18:30] was gone and off to say no
[18:33] in the upper room she's one of the 120
[18:35] in the upper room
[18:37] and asking god send down the fire upon
[18:40] us send us down the holy ghost that we
[18:41] could
[18:42] live just the way jesus lived that we
[18:45] could live just like my son lived
[18:47] not that i'd done anything for him he
[18:49] was yours all along i was just part of
[18:52] the element
[18:56] you love him this morning you love your
[18:59] mothers
[19:01] amen god's certainly good to us
[19:04] let's stand to our feet i told you i
[19:06] wasn't gonna keep you alone
[19:22] uh
[19:27] i tell you when you're thinking about
[19:30] these services and i
[19:31] you try to think of a way to close them
[19:32] and
[19:34] you pray for the god lead you and
[19:36] sometimes in service like you just don't
[19:37] know how to close
[19:38] you just don't know what to say what do
[19:39] you say after that scene
[19:50] i just thank god
[19:54] that mary didn't give up on him
[19:58] life would have went on the history
[20:01] would have been the same
[20:03] it wasn't going to change the course but
[20:06] it paved
[20:06] the way from others
[20:10] just by our heads heavenly father
[20:17] it's a different kind of message this
[20:19] morning lord and i i know that
[20:23] but it's the reality of
[20:27] of what mothers face from day to day
[20:30] as we hear the challenges that were
[20:32] brought forth the life that
[20:34] susana wesley lived the dedication that
[20:37] she lived
[20:39] just so that she could see her sons and
[20:41] children the rest of her children be
[20:43] successful
[20:44] not only successful but men of god
[20:47] no doubt her desire was make my children
[20:49] men
[20:50] for you and god you honored her prayer
[20:55] through the hardship through the
[20:56] sacrifice she still
[20:58] didn't waver from her dedication and
[21:01] millions
[21:02] were saved
[21:06] and mary through all of her hardship
[21:09] chasing jesus around in the in the
[21:13] in the city lord trying to find him and
[21:16] panicked and and worried and her heart
[21:19] broken
[21:20] from the comments that he would make and
[21:22] what seemed to be belittling to
[21:24] us in the natural we could only see that
[21:26] he was having to take a spiritual
[21:28] approach
[21:28] at his mother but on that final day
[21:33] on calvary as he looked down upon his
[21:37] mother
[21:39] words of peace as he said ma'am
[21:44] here's your son
[21:47] what you've done has helped
[21:50] save the world we don't idolize mary we
[21:55] don't lift her up as a saint as other
[21:57] religious factors do
[22:00] but lord we know you loved her
[22:04] she gave everything that she had lord
[22:08] for you and lord in return as we look at
[22:12] that part of the scripture
[22:13] how she lived her life for you was with
[22:16] you everywhere you went
[22:18] every step you took she was by your side
[22:22] i want that kind of dedication lord
[22:25] that every step i take
[22:28] every stride i make is by your side lord
[22:33] because i can't make it without you lord
[22:37] lord i pray a special blessing upon the
[22:39] mothers
[22:40] not only this day but in the days and
[22:42] years to come
[22:46] they're so special lord
[22:54] there's a special place for mom and our
