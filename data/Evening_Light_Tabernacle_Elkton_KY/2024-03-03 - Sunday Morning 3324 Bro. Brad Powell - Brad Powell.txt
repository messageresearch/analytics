you would in your Bibles and we'll start in the book of Isaiah chapter 54 I'm G to I'm G to do some things a little different this morning I don't plan on on holding us long this morning and sometimes time gets away from us and I think we can all be guilty of that but we're going to do our best to kind of maybe just do things a little different maybe a little bit more on the Evangelistic side and and just encourage us and and make sure that uh all hearts are clear and we're getting ready to have a communion today and I just want my heart clear and I want to be led and and by the by the Holy Ghost and I want the hand of God in my life and so we want to speak on that this morning and if we would take a little time and as you're turning to Isaiah and I think you about all made it I want to read you this quote here um and it's in the message why I'm praying for the sick he says but after all passing tracks is not preaching the gospel the gospel came not in in word only said Paul but through the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost he said not just teach the word but preach the word make manifest you I looked up that word manifest we hear it many times but I I looked it up and to make manifest means to clear or or obvious make obvious to the eye or Mind by one's Acts or appearance yeah so it's it's our jobs to manifest the the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost to manifest it to those who look at us the those who see us the those that we're working around the those that we go to school with it's us to to put on the appearance and and the and act so that it makes obvious what we are it makes obvious who we are and he says and and once it's made manifest he said then it's quickened it means it's increased in life yeah that means we we begin to grow they begin to see Christ we begin to grow the word of God begins to live out through us we become living breathing working acting uh represent representatives of Jesus Christ and he said it's quickened and it's brought to pass what God said about it he says that's the gospel in action that's the gospel in action the New Testament Christianity amen so brothers and sisters I want you to know this morning as we get started I want you to know this morning that the hands of God can do more the hands of God can hold more can conquer more can love more the hands of God can heal more than anyone can ever imagine the hands of God this morning I challenge you to put your lives into the hands of God fully trusting in the hands of God Almighty and the holy spirit amen so that the so that our lives speak more than just we're from evening light Tabernacle Our Lives will speak more than our pastor is brother Thomas baller or my mom and daddy is this or that but our lives speak the life of Jesus [Applause] Christ we're not here to blend in you know that's where the church world and I don't mean to keep you saying it but I'm G to preach just a minute that's why the church world has gotten away from God they Tred to blend in with the world I se a newspaper article several months ago the Methodist Church 54% of the people are leaving the Methodist system why because they allowing homosexuality into the pull pits they're allowing same-sex marriages transgenders what are they doing what is their motive they are blending into what the devil is doing into the world they're not sticking with the word of God but they're just slowly blending into it you can't even tell the difference we should look different than the world our appearance our acts our talk should be different than the world Isaiah 54 and verse 11 oh thou Afflicted tossed with Tempest and not comforted behold I will lay thy stones with Fair colors and lay the foundation with sapphires I will make thy Windows of a Gates and Thy Thy Gates of carun and all thy borders of pleasant stones and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the Peace of thy children and righteousness shall thou be established thou shal be far from oppression amen for thou shalt not fear and from Terror for it shall not come unto thee amen behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever Shall Gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake now I want you to listen to this scripture here behold I have created the Smith that blows the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the waster to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper amen and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment sh Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of Lord this is what you've got to look forward to as a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ this is your this is your heritage this is your inheritance that no [Applause] weapon formed against Caleb Bor it can't happen no weapon that is formed against the shall Prosper for for the tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and the righteousness of me saith the Lord let's pray Heavenly Father we're thankful Lord to be in your house this morning and we certainly feel your presence and and Lord we just ask Lord that you would just come down and speak to our hearts in a in a mighty way this morning Lord just to encourage us and lift us and show us where maybe we have some short comings in our life cuz Lord we don't want to come up short we don't want to be marred in the hands of the Potter we we want our lives to be clean and clear and we want our our token to be on display and and to be true representation of what Jesus Christ is in this day and Lord we just ask your blessings upon this word and in the people Lord in Jesus name we pray amen you can have your seats I want to speak for a few minutes this morning and I want to talk to you about living in the hands of God and if I were to uh put a title on my message this morning I would title it action figures action figures and and we look at this scripture that we just read brothers and sisters and and we look at it and it says behold I created the Smith and he's talking about here he's talking about the blacksmith and he says I created the Smith and what he's telling us here is that everything that can affect your welfare no matter what Satan brought you no matter how hard it gets no matter how the enemy comes up on you everything he throws at you in your life is under my control it's under my control see the blacksmith who manufactures the instruments of war he manufactures the instruments of torture yeah is under God's control we allow Satan to become so big and we think about this and we think about the weapons of Satan and he's typing it here into the natural with the instruments of war now think about the ancient instruments of war you have Spears you have javelins you have the bow and the arrow and the sling you have hand-to hand combat weapons swords and clubs and battle axes and knives you have weapons from a distance the catapults that Siege the towers you have battering rams how many ever feels like Satan batters at you Satan will take a catapult and throw a big flaming ball of fire right at your home and that's what's that's what God is saying so he's telling us that all of the weapons that Satan uses against you doubt fear discouragement disappointments how many's ever had disappointments sure we all do but he's telling us that all of these things are under God's control Satan may come out us like a fierce Warrior it's his motive to kill steal and destroy so he is he is trained in Warfare but this blacksmith all of his strength all of his life all of his skills God says it's in my hand [Applause] and he says that all of his strength all his skills he can do nothing with them unless he ows it oh my you mean the the enemy that def fights us the enemy of the church the waster the Destroyer the one that goes out and goes out and he's he's trying to take control of the nation after nation and he's bringing war against Nation after nation and and he's Waring at you and he's trying to tear your home and your life and your children he's trying to tear all that apart the waser you you mean God created him and he's in God's control important that we live our lives that our lives are lived in the hand of God under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and the token is applied into our homes you see this battle taking place two hands two hands and they're both Gods the prophet said Satan knows just what you're a little afraid of yeah did you ever think about that Satan knows just what you're a little afraid of and he says there's no need of me trying to get around it he says I'm just a little afraid of those things because they get at me many times you mean the prophet the messenger of the hour says that there's things that Satan knows the little things that he's afraid of in his life and he begins to attack at him he knows exactly what your fears are your anxieties your disappointments and he begins to sit there and he begins to Chisel at you and chisel at at you right and he said I'm a little afraid of those things he said so that's the reason Satan knows he can Bluff at you y Bluff it's not anything go God has this all in control brothers and sisters don't forget that don't forget when Satan is is knocking at your door and he's knocking at your door and he's trying to deliver things to you that you don't want in your life God is in control and he's bluffing he says so that's the reason he he's a bluff he says but now watch he says but now if this congregation will set real reverent remember he's praying if this congregation will set real reverent when anything is going on be real reverent and see that God's got the situation under control he said said you'll just watch what happens and you will see that everything will be all right that's right what an assurance it is to know as Christians our lives are under the control of God Almighty and Satan's life is under the control of God Almighty the waster can't come to waste he can come and knock but he can't stick around how many times brothers and sisters have we heard throughout the message you'll hear the prophet say now in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God I take every spirit in here under my control over and over and over and over we hear him say that what's he doing he's taking action physically and he's speaking Jesus he is a physical body sitting up there under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and he's sitting there and he Fe feels and knows and and is aware of all of these spirits around him cancers so why do we allow Satan to control Our Lives why do we allow Satan to come in and tell us that we're going to do this or you need to do this or you need to you need to don't go to church tonight don't go to church tonight you won't get nothing out of it you're tired you're you've been working all day you've been you've been at it all day long there's no need you going to church take it under control take the spirit under control he says listen now I take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of God and may the Lord Jesus Christ who is my full God my full God he didn't say I'm going to do a little bit of this my way I'm going to pray for this one over here the way God wants me to but over here I'm going to do what I want want to do because I don't like this person I I I know they got a bad Spirit I'm going to do it my way he didn't say that do you see lot of times when we get the conal side in and let the carnal side overshadow the spiritual side I'm GNA let him take be my full guide that my life is now surrendered to him as an empty channel that he speaks through brothers and sisters we need to find ourselves emptying ourselves out in Allowing God to come more into our lives we get so clogged up and so muddled with the things of this world one of his biggest enemies is [Applause] distractions well some of you's got iPhones man I tell you what if there was ever a distraction thrown at me I think well I'm just going to look for just a second 30 minutes yeah 45 minutes go ahead hour and a half you know what I'm talking about don't act like put your wings up and let's preach help me preach put your wings up and help me preach two hours later you're still Ticky talking some of you know you say well I don't have those things praise the Lord what about your job oh we don't like when we talk about that cuz then we taking away The Cadillacs we're taking away the cars we're taking away the four-wheelers the side by sides the boats the bows the arrows the guns the hunting trips wo somebody's helping me preach because this ain't in my notes distractions come at us from every direction it'll get on your kids yes your kids will distract you from God with the things they do and we're proud parents we want them to be involved but sometimes the over the the the over involvement overtakes [Applause] God he said but I want not I want my life is now surrendered to him as an empty channel that he may have control in my life he has control in my life that his Spirit May control everything that's in here wouldn't you like to know that every day that you walked that his Spirit controlled every single thing every environment every time you want to lose your temper every time somebody cuts you off on the road every time somebody done a dirty business deal then right there you're so emptied out and God is so much poured into you that he's in control of everything and he's in control of every and cast out every single evil spirit he said that's right he said and if I'm so cleaned out that the spirit control everything he can heal every sick person that's in the building tonight he said believe me as God's servant for I speak in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you brothers and sisters this wasn't the the prophet's life he's no different than you or I that's right in hisself he could do nothing right they said brother brand can you will you heal me I can't do it he said it's already been done by Jesus Christ brother Brown what do I do I need to go here do I need to do he couldn't do any of those things he couldn't pull any of that out outside of the gift of the Holy Spirit working on the gift in his life without the Holy Spirit and the channel to operate through he's no different than us but he knew knew he had to let that physical body come under subjection so that the mind of God could come in and take complete control of the situations turn with me to Jeremiah 18 these water bottles have round bottoms it's dangerous up [Applause] here Jeremiah chapter 18 familiar scripture we we've read it several times in the past and preachers have preached on it for decades you're curious aren't you look at sister Alicia she's smiling she's curious curious what's in it ain't rattlesnakes we're not going that route this is something different Jeremiah chapter 18 verse one the word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to The Potter's House and there I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to The Potter's House and behold he wrought a work on the wheel and the vessel that he made of clay was mored in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the Potter to make it then the word of the Lord came to me saying oh House of Israel cannot I do with you as this Potter sayeth the Lord behold as the clay is in The Potter's hand so are ye in my hand oh House of Israel brothers and sisters we are privileged people today to know that our lives are in the hands of a Potter that no matter what we go through no matter how M it may be he don't throw away the clay you can make mistakes and and God just simply goes in and he pushes the mold back down and starts to spin again and again and again till he gets you where he wants you because why he loves you that much so here here here he is Jeremiah's down here and he's he's down here and he's watching this Potter at work and Jeremiah notices this lump of clay NOW Watch What Happens here this lump P Clay is uncooperative are you with me this lump of clay is uncooperative the clay is not doing what the Potter wants it to do this clay has not fully surrendered itself it hasn't become pliable and flexible into the hand of the Potter you see the elements think with me now the elements of that clay can we say the elements of this clay the elements of this clay some sometimes have not been broken down to where it's pliable into the hands of the Potter and this this lump of clay is doing its own thing uhhuh this lump of clay it's it's going where it wants to go it don't go to church when it don't want to go it's watching things it shouldn't be watching it's listening to things that shouldn't be listened to why because it's a lump of clay doing its own thing the elements God has not been broken down yet by the word of God that's right and so what happens is as the poar is turn it the clay becomes unstable oh you you've seen those Christians oneir oneir you think of one third one third of what they're at church one third of the time the kids are at church one third of the time because they're at home onethird of the time they don't have a ride to get to church cuz Mama's at home daddy's at home Guardians at home well i' been I tell you what I've been preaching this for about the last 10 sermons somebody's G to get it I'm tired of preaching [Applause] it but how we act in the hands of God tells us tells our children what is okay to do well well but yet we say we want to be led by God we want to walk like God we want to talk like God we want to speak we want we want our lives to look like God but yet we failed to surrender completely the elements of this clay to God right you know brother B he was talking about the one-third Wes deny a little bit he didn't call it that but that's what I'm calling it you I tell you like I told some other brother I was just being honest with there's no there's no gray area with me it's black or white if you don't like what I'm saying I'm sorry I'm gonna tell it to you [Applause] anyway but I can I can say and I don't say it I guess if you want to say proudly I can say proud I don't know I don't know what the word right word is when we talk about our kids parents young people when you get married your kids are so important yeah getting your kids in a in a stable committed relationship in your church family is of utmost importance you know I made it my goal one year years ago when I first started really serving the lord I made it my goal I was not going to miss a a church service for an entire year no matter what my wife can attest to this you know we start those New Year's resolutions and so that was my New Year's resolution I'm not going to miss a single church service this year because I'm serving God with my whole heart about that time I was Big Time Florida State simos football fan oh oh you know they had that big bowl game about January the 7th about that year it was early then back in those days joke you so Hannah said he he would never be there he he won't be at church at bowl games tonight I missed that bowl game I don't even know who won it didn't matter because I had made a commitment that I was going to be in the house of God my kids know that on Wednesday Sunday and if we had Church Thursday Friday Saturday we would be right here in the house of God I've never once had my children ask me are we going to to church tonight never once have they ever asked me here a while back about two months three months ago I was I was sick and I thought I had to co so I was going to stay home and and it was about time to come to church on a Wednesday night and Carson looks at me he says are you going to church man I felt rebuked I never had to ask him he's asking me right there you go this last week my wife was under the weather back was hurting her tremendously he said Wednesday night she said I don't think I don't know if I'm going to church tonight I said well why not she said cuz I don't feel good I said she looked at me like I was crazy I said I think it's a valid question why are you not going to church she was here for those who was here she was here but there should not be that that that that that the elements of this body come in sub subjection and subm to the hands of the Potter and we wonder why things are not peachy in our life we wonder why and and then we begin to ask God wise yeah why am I not happy why can't I overcome things why are my kids going astray why why is my job miserable has anybody ever wor in a miserable job I thought I was the only one why is my marriage Rocky but the let me tell you what the better question is is the better question we should ask is how did I get to this place yeah we ought to ask ourselves that how did I end up here was I faithful to God was I faithful to God and so that so that he could bless me in these things or was I just over here letting him push me back down on the wheel push me back down on the wheel push me back down on the wheel and we want to ask these questions but then Isaiah tells us woe to those who quarrel with the maker ah you want to go throwing questions at God why why why you better be careful woe to those who argue with God why would we argue with God when we're the ones and it's not that it's not that we shouldn't ever cushion or say something to God like you know God why why but it's the attitude we come at god with it why are you doing this God I serve you with all my heart once a month you said we don't tell the rest of the story we're not like Paul Harvey and tell the rest of the story we we cut it off God i' I've I've been in church my entire life because your mom and daddy took you well can the clay speak to the Potter no the clay can never tell the Potter what he wants to be you said well I want to be this in the economy of God that's not your choice I want to be this I want to do that I want to I want to travel the world that's not your choice the clay can't tell the Potter what he wants to be it's the Potter's mind that puts to the clay what the vessel should end up being there's people that believe that they actually believe they have the right to tell God what they're going to do and it's God's job to listen to them God you need to follow my instructions I'm going to do this this and this we can't try to tell the Potter what to doen the Potter the power is in the manifestation of The Potter's hands how many's ever watched a Potter spin anything out spin a vessel out maybe you've seen it on Tik Tok that's one of them traps I got caught watching this guy spin a pot one day this a week or so ago probably said where some of this came from before I knew I done watched him make 30 of them identical to the first one had a whole table out there I thought man I'm GNA be a pro at this but they make this pottery and it's called throwing pottery and I I looked this up in one of this one of these uh uh Potters they said it it's also called handbuilding and I thought my goodness if God ain't handbuilding a throwing is some say because the Potter actually throws the clay onto the wheel to make it stick and she said I call it throwing because when I work on a piece all day long I feel like throwing it out the window but you throw the clay down onto the wheel and the Potter has into his mind what kind of vessel he's going to build he thinks this out long and hard and he knows exactly what wants it to look like he knows exactly what size it's going to be he knows exactly what the shape is going to be and what it's going to be used for in his house are you with me and this Potter grabs this lump of clay and he begins to add a little water to it to give it a little life Lord and he begins to add that water and his goal is to make that lump of clay come alive in his hands and he begins to spin on this wheel and and it starts off spinning and he he begins to coddle this clump of clay have you ever seen it and it starts to spin and he takes his hands and man he just forms and he's working and he's got this little ball starting to form and he's doing all this and I think man he's building faith yeah he's starting on a foundation he's building he's building the base that this vessel was going to stand upon and he's building up some faith and he's building up some virtue and he's building up some knowledge and he gets to that point and then all of a sudden there's a technique called pinching I said pinching how many likes to be pinched but the part of takes his hands he sticks them down inside the clay and begins to pinch and he begins to work up the sides of the clay and he's pinching and he he's trying to get you up there with patience anybody ever pinched on you oh man they'll try your patience and he's pinching and he's pinching and he's pulling up the vessel and he's trying to get it up to the top and it's narrowing and it's narrowing and it's narrowing and you get up there right about godliness and that thing starts to go it's on that wheel and it begins to wobble and that vessel is just a shaking back and forth and back and forth and back and forth why because that that vessel don't have enough godliness in it yeah and the Potter he Tri and he pinches some more he puts a little more pressure on it and he tries to mold it and it just begins to just wobble wobble and he just pushes it back down let's start back let's let's try Faith again that's exactly how it goes sister Becky if you got any age on you brother Woody you know what I'm talking about this vessel this vessel gets to go push right back down into the wheel and a Potter begins to spin on it again and the prophet said herein now is set forth in that very thing the love of God yes you think that's the love of God that's the love of God that he brings me up so high then pushes me back down onto the wheel I don't need those who already preached them that's the love of God he said he wants he's Desiring the love of a family of his own the sons and Sons of a family Sons like himself and he lies there all of mankind as one lump of clay and he says he takes that one lump and he begins to make vessels of honor and dishonor yeah you remember the wasters yeah you remember the wasters you remember the Smith the blacksmith so he's got vessels of honor and vessels of Dishonor and he says it's his choosing to be which one it is he said it's his choosing the ones born of the spirit will be trained to conform Into His Image they'll be trained that will spins and in our lives the hands of the poter begins to train up that vessel yes we're looking for complated vessels brothers and sisters and he said he's working on him he's breaking him down in order that he can rebuild it exactly as he desires not as you desire not as I desire sometimes life makes me angry because it don't go the way I think it should [Applause] go then I have to look back and I say God my life is in your hands it does mean no good to worry it does mean no good to fret it doesn't mean no good to get angry to get discouraged you think that's that's that's you I'm fixing to say a big mouthful here think about job and everything was taken away from him everything put yourself in his shoes and imagine that your entire life is gone and that's in the hands of the Potter Brothers and Sisters I want my life to be fashioned by The Potter's hand this morning I want my life to be fashioned so that I can walk like him so that I can talk like him so that I can act like him so that he can be fully in control of my life that no questions asked I don't want to say God why I want to say God use me back in 200 BC there was articulated dolls back that they find all the way back to 200 BC these dolls were made of wood and clay and and and and straw and might might call them mannequins later on they found a later ones and they found little to 10 soldiers and toy soldiers and as a Time goes on and we go on into the 19th century we find out the French and the German and and the the Japanese and all the different ones uh had been making little toy soldiers and they were articulated they could move their hands moved their arms moved their legs moved it wasn't until 1964 Hasbro come out and coin the term action figure 1964 they brought to Market GI Joe now Barbie had already been on the scene back in 50 54 but now they brought onto the same GI Joe and turned it action figure because now now we have an action figure that has 21 moving parts we have 21 move in part on this Soldier and his uniform has been made to look exactly like those of the Navy those of the army those of the Air Force those are the Marines it looks exactly like the one who it was imaged after yeah the most popular action figure GI Joe in the early 1980s a man by the name of Terry Eugene boia stepped on the scene Terry Eugene boia became an international icon he became a larger than life image young boys loved him they wanted to talk like him they wanted to imitate they walk like him they talk like him not just kids but adults a Mania was born let me introduce you to Terry Eugene [Applause] oh yeah you probably know him as Hulk Hogan Hulk Hogan came on the scene in the 80s you know who Hulk Hogan is you don't know good for you Hulk Hogan came on the scene in the 80s as a as an international superstar in the wrestling scene everybody wanted to be like Hulk Hogan didn't they brother John Hulk Mania and he had all these little Hawkers oh yeah with these 24 inch pythons brother hokam Mania swept the world so I started I want to be a part of ham Mania I was 11 years old don't look at me like y'all Angels please maybe yours wasn't hul Mania it was something else how many you girls had Barbie dolls oh come on raise your hands yeah there's hands up here so I started collecting these wrestling [Music] figures had my dad go up in attic I said dad this said this is gonna sound really strange to you I said but can you this was yeah yesterday can you go up in the attic and get my Hulk Hogan he said Son them things are probably melted I said we'll bring him anyway but I had to have this wrestling figure and so my friend we started collecting these me and my friend we had a wrestling ring I probably got 15 of these I was looking at them yesterday at dinner at my parents oh yeah I had them all George Animal steel Hulk Hogan brsh of Barber beef cake jyd I'm speaking French but we had them all me and my friend we we would get together with this and we would I'd get my Hulk Hogan he'd get his Andre the Giant how many's heard of Andre the Giant all right and I tell you what we would get together and we would bring these little things to life I could make Hulk Hogan live one of the biggest events that ever happened in the 80s what happened on March the 29th 1987 WrestleMania 3 Hulk Hogan was to take on Andre the Giant Hulk Hogan is 67 290 lbs that's what he claims he's probably not quite that big he likes to embellish a little bit 24 inch pons brother no but he was to take on Andre the Giant 7 foot6 in 550 lb [Music] giant man you talking about pay-per-view that was when it first started that pay-per-view blew up Across the Nation everybody wanted to watch WrestleMania they want to see what would happen and let me tell you what happened it was at the end of the match and Hulk Hogan he got a hold of Andre and he picked him up about this far I had to set him back down and they interviewed him later he said I didn't know if I was going to be able to do it or not you know it's all staged I don't break the news to you it's all staged my dad told that to my friend when we were playing he started crying he got some mad he couldn't he got some mad don't you tell me I know it's real it's real it's all staged but then later on he got a hold to this 550 lb 7 foot 6 joh and he picked him up over his head and slammed him down and the world went wild let me tell you I made this little man right here slam Andre the Giant 15,000 times after that we relive that scene over and over and over why because it was an iconic time in history when when web wrestling was taking over the nation but let me tell you something about this guy right here you see this guy he can't do nothing if he ain't in my hand jump speak jump off a top rope power drive have you seen him move yet if he does we're we're going we're going to have a conversation [Music] no that's why it's so important that we are fully in control of the Master's hands when we place our lives into the hand of God then we begin to move then we begin to praise then we begin to clap then we begin to shout then we begin to overcome then we begin to see things start happen in our lives why because the Bible says in the book of Acts that great Miracles were happened at the hands of Paul not God Paul what was it it was God working through Paul these Miracles begin to take place and what was it it was Paul acting as the hand of all Mighty [Applause] God 45 verses in the New Testament speak about the hands the Old Testament describes the hands of God as descriptive in his hands are the Deep places of the earth it says we are the Sheep of his hand his hand is outstretched to the Nations on on the cross Jesus said into my father's hands I commend my spirit the hand of God is Authority the right hand of God is a good standing Paul was given the right hand of Fellowship as a a token a measure of appreciation into the church laying on of hands has been used to bless preachers laying on the hands pray for the sick laying on the hands hands hands hands with these hands we give praise to God with these hands we pray to God with these hands the working hand we clap our hands and appreciation we show our love to our spouse by putting a ring on their hand when a child is sick we take our hands and we pull them up to us it's all about the hand of God hands hands hands vessels of clay I think about Peter there and Peter as he's looking out there and he's on that boat and he looks out there and he sees Jesus at a distance and he said B me to come so he jumps out he says come so he jumps out he gets just a little bit of ways out there and what does he say he starts to seek and he says save me Lord and it says Jesus outstretched his hand to lift him [Music] up let me tell you it's never too deep it's never too far away it's never too dim it's never too Grim it's never too Bleak when God's hand reaches down into your life there's a little jarus was sitting back there and brother brandham said that jarus was a he said he was a secret believer he said he was a secret believer in so much that that he believed in Jesus he watched The Miracles he seen the Miracles but anytime Jesus was talked about he would get real quiet and kind of clam up he never would admit to it and and the prophet said but one day his little girl got sick he said his little girl got sick and here was Jerry out there he was fixing to go through a molding process let me tell you God began to work and mold on him and he says Jerry's called the doctor and the doctor said we'll give her some antibiotics for a few days and she'll be fine but he said Time After Time After Time she kept getting worse and worse and worse and he said the doctor would come look at her again and she's just getting worse and worse until finally the doctor had to look at jarus and say let me tell you I hate to say this but your little girl is at the point of death let me tell you that right there will make a man get into action he didn't care who knew he was a Believer that's right at that point he went to his wife the prophet said he went to his wife and he began to tell her he said you know what I got to do I got to go see that man that Nazarene I gotta go see that man of Nazareth Jesus the one who's healing people and she said I know that's exactly what you got to do go quick go get him said he put on his little coat his little turban over his head he started down there and he heard some church members said where you going jarus ain't that the way it is yeah where are you going he said you know what I'm gonna go get Jesus are you one of them Holy Rollers Jess are you one of them Holy Rollers that's going to go down there and see that guy the Deacon the Deacon called him out he said wait a minute now jarus you can't do that what would the new pastor think about you huh but brother brandham said brother the time had come for action and he said jarus had to have some action the time he says may strike you for action and you may have to stand all alone in the spotlight of everybody and Watch God's hand work in your life and he said he stood there and he said it's time for the church to take action all around take action and he said here's little jaras he worked his way down through the crowd and he gets to Jesus and he finally got to him and he says I need you to come my daughter is sick they've given her up no hope now watch what happens along the way the prophet tells that as Jesus and jarus went walking he's working along to go with him and all of a sudden he says who touched me come on Lord we got to go my daughter's my my daughter's life depends on you but Jesus said there was a hand that touched him who was it to touch my garment the woman with a blood issue you see sometimes things come in time sometimes God has other things to do he's not an instant he's not an instant coffee and he said finally all that goes on and the woman's healed and Jesus is gathering himself and they're walking again and he said there's two Blind Men that's been blind since birth and now after years and years and years of being blind we're going to take the time to heal them my daughter did you hear me my daughter Lord she's laying there sick she's laying there dead she she's about to die you're going to have to get there and he said he took his face fingers and placed his hands on the blind eyes and healed those blind eyes you see there's healing in them hands there's healing in your hands some of you believe it and he said he he he got him down there and he walks right down there to the house and he's getting ready to go in and he said all of a sudden he hears this screaming and crying going on all the screaming and crying is going on and they're saying she's dead dead she's dead she's dead she's gone jar we've already had to embal her body huh she's laying on the couch she's dead the poor little thing he said and Jesus starts going and all that carrying on like that he said hey give me peace can you imagine you know how we get all tore up we get all tore up at at death and and and and because why because it emotionally it affects us because we're the ones still here we're the ones hurting they're living on but we're the ones that's grieving we're the ones that's hurting we're happy for them but yet that that love and that it's gone it rips a pain in our heart and the crying and screaming Jesus said give me peace she's not dead she's only [Music] asleep and the Bible says that they looked at him and they laughed huh and you going to believe this guy jerus she's laying there cold we've and bombed her we got her body ready for the tomb the doctor told you two days ago to get her shroud ready to get her tomb ready now she's laying here in bombed and you're going to say that this listen at this guy look at him laugh at him he say she's asleep what kind of healer is this and Jesus says get them out take every body out of the house I need to PE I need peace and I need quiet I need you out of the house and he said he took everybody else and taken and he take the father and the mother and put the rest of them out and there's jarus sitting there who believed him with all his heart and he said he walks down in the house he looks down on that little girl on the couch and she's laying there on that couch about 12 years old and Jesus Walks over to her and he takes her by the hand hand and he said he takes her by the hand and he spoke in an unknown tongue you I don't know what it means it must mean breathe to LIF just like that cherish's daughter Rises up the situation is completely changed why because she was in the hands of the master right the hands of Jesus bring healing it brings teaching it brings love it brings blessings it brings prayer it brings salvation the hands of Jesus are strong the hands of Jesus are powerful the hands of Jesus are corrective but more importantly the hands of Jesus are loving Brother and Sisters Let's stand to our feet musicians if you come God has created each one of us in the in the way he wants us to be and it's our responsibility to take what God has done in our lives and what God wants to do in our lives and take it with pleasure not to ask and not to question not to debate not to argue but just just as the clay finds his purpose when it remains pliable in the hands of the Potter so is our lives our lives are as long as we're in the hands of the pot Potter and our lives are pliable to do whatever the Potter says brothers and sisters in the hand of God you don't need a cape you don't need to be called Superman you don't have to be called Wonder Woman you don't have to have superpower you don't have to have super muscles but in the hands of God all you

end of the trailer and the cab hanging off of The Edge maybe 100 120 ft to the water and I thought my goodness and then all of a sudden I see I see a a man repelling down a rope off of a ladder truck a fire truck and I said Lord have mercy there's a person in that truck and I couldn't help but think about the fear that that person person must have been experiencing as they dangled off of that bridge and the relief that they must have had when they seen that rescue were dangling from that rope and put that harness around them and wrapped their arms around them and said come with me I'm taking you to safety yes God can wrap his arms around you this [Music] morning he loves us this morning little girl was lying there people all were weeping they just laughed at Jesus when he said

First Corinthians trust everybody can hear what the spirit is trying to say to us amen 1 Corinthians 11 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he hath given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had slept saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you drink of this bread or eat of this bread and drink of this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come what soever shall eat of this bread and drink of this this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for these cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come let's have a moment of silence as you judge yourself and examine yourself amen amen amen if our deacons would come up this time and everybody that wants to partake

was come that he should depart out of this world and unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into heart the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he porth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord does TH wash my feet Jesus saith unto him say answerest and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet and Jesus anth him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head and Jesus saith unto him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had he had had
