have your seats this evening um I want to read a testimony um for my mom before we sing the next song um it's a bit of a lengthy read but I texted some of the brothers last night that my mom had gone into surgery um she's been dealing with a tumor and her somewhere in her stomach area for about eight years now and she had surgery on it in 2015 but they didn't take out the whole thing and then it grew bigger so she finally after years of battling with insurance and different stuff like that she finally got a surgery in California yesterday with two Specialists um but there's just a lot of complications going into it and um she was just praying for certain things she didn't want to get taken out and different stuff but I just wanted to read what she texted us today and we've been praying for a long time just want to thank everyone for their prayers um and she had been praying that she wouldn't need a blood transfer um and just a lot of really specific stuff but anyway she my dad texted last night the surgery is over uh the tumor was non-cancerous no blood transfusions were needed and there is very little blood loss um and then my mom texted me this morning uh good news everyone I get to go home today Dr kivnick came in at 6 30 this morning to check things out everything looks good I mean hardly any pain I'm up and down on my own using the restroom and drinking fluids he talked about my surgery and that it all went well he said it was just perfect basically I'm trying to think the word he used but I can't remember right now but it was perfect the tumor was not glued to anything else just as we had asked and prayed it was behind my colon he said it was a very unusual placement for him and of course that pushed everything out she had been looking like she was about nine months pregnant the tumor had pushed so far out and people were actually asking her when the baby was due but anyways um she said uh it came up to just with my belly button he said once they removed it everything fell right back into place where it belongs I said they did not injure anything while they were in there praise God what a great God we serve Dr kivnick after all these years of doing this and he's scratching his head on this one that's our God so I came in [Applause] hey man so we want to thank you all for all of your prayers our families very thankful and if you

good evening good to be in the house of the Lord good to see everybody back once again amen we just had a good time me and my wife is celebrating our uh anniversary and also Mother's Day trust you all had a good Mother's Day amen and so praise the Lord God is good isn't he amen amen I can't think of any announcements or anything so let's just bow our heads and go into the word Lord Jesus we come before you father tonight Lord we're thankful once again to assemble ourselves together knowing Lord that wherever two or three are gathered you promised there you'd be in our midst Lord and certainly we feel your presence here tonight Lord and your children and your people father and we appreciate you Lord Jesus and we want to just talk about you and and brag on you so to speak father and lift you up magnify you Lord and for that's the only thing that there is to look at Lord that's the only thing that's admirable is you Lord and we ask God that you'll bless the meditation of our heart father the message I feel you've laid on my heart to speak tonight we ask God did you just give us an anointing Lord and blessed in the way that you want to bless it and speak the words that you want to speak father you know all the needs that's represented here Lord and we lift them up before you Lord and we ask God that you meet and you'd supply all those needs according to your riches amen we ask these blessings and favors in Jesus name amen and amen kind of a different thought this morning I mean this evening it's not really different it's certainly something we've spoken on before amen but it was just uh maybe just a little different direction maybe than what I usually speak on it amen and so I don't know if y'all have looked at the title amen already we gave it early this time amen you think about giving a an early title in my number you have a dual effect but hopefully it doesn't have an ideal effect with us and they're right we're coming whether we like it or not isn't that right so praise the Lord God bless you amen amen so praise the Lord if you will turn your Bibles amen God's family unit is what I want to speak on tonight God's family unit amen and we want to talk about the family of God I mean it's glad to be part of the family of God Amen over in Genesis let's go to Genesis we'll just start and this is such depth as I begin to look at it that I realize that uh it'll just take the Lord to help me to try to get this thing halfway you know however the Lord wants to lay it out because there's so much in it amen and so much could be brought out but we'll just I mean start somewhere and see what the Lord will have for us amen um in basically what we want to speak on we want to talk a little bit about the attributes you mean God's attributes as a father as a husband amen a mother a brother a sister and a friend so that's a lot of covering there isn't it amen like the song says he's everything he's everything to me he's my father my mother and my sister and my brother he's everything to us amen we want to try to dwell on that but we're going to pull in amen some of these other things also while we're at it amen but uh amen and it's always talking about amen amen so let's read Genesis the second chapter I believe it is Genesis 2 we're going to start with 18 and then skip down to verse 21. we're not going to go through Adam naming all the creatures but we just want to focus on his help me and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make him and help me for him all right down in verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now a bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of a man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh amen and they were both naked in the man and his wife and they were not ashamed I want to read another one over in Ephesians over in the book of Ephesians I want to read a very familiar scripture for us all right Ephesians and we'll begin with chapter five and verse 22 down all the way to the end of the chapter wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even this Christ is the head of the church and he's the savior of the body now notice that he's the savior of the body how many he believes that this husband that we have he's our savior amen it don't matter what we get into as his wife he always delivers us he's always Our Savior amen praise the Lord okay therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies he had love with his wife loveth himself amen now let's just think spiritual wise we're reading down here because we know that he's speaking concerning the Christ and the church isn't that right amen so for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherished it even as the Lord to church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones but his cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife in day two shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular to love his wife even as himself and the listen and the wife see that she reverence her husband may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated this evening I do want to um let me see here that's in First Corinthians read one more scripture in when he was talking about a woman shouldn't cut her hair and so forth and in in chapter 11 of First Corinthians he makes a statement but I would have you to know that man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God Amen so we already painted a picture of of what uh God had in his mind at the beginning amen isn't that right amen when he created man when he created a woman and so forth he was a a it was something that God had in his mind amen uh of something further down the road amen so we're talking we're going to talk with the help of the Lord for a little while about marriage amen talking about the family you mean the whole family you know and we already know that uh uh you know the the family is and I didn't pull it up I've totally forgot about that um and I won't do it now but in the church age book you all remember where brother Ben wanted a coach he says now God he said he wanted to be he wanted a family of his own he wanted sons and daughters like himself amen and then he talks about how that he'll be training them sons and daughters and so forth to be in His image and they'll be becoming his very image in order to be United with him and so forth but the point that that wanted to pull out is that God desired a family of his own amen God desired to have a family isn't that right and one of his attributes of course was to be a father but how many knows you can't be a father until you're a husband isn't that right first you become a husband and and so forth you got to be married to have children and so forth amen but now amen we want to talk about the fatherhood we want to talk about God's Providence and so forth with the help of God and what really what really kind of brought me to this is I thought that I've always had and have thought that I've always really really uh enjoyed in the Lord and that is uh God's Providence God's Providence amen amen and so how did God always provides now and I was thinking of on in my own self with my wife with my family and so forth and you can think of it in your family but amen any any time that uh uh you get married and I thought about you know uh you know I'll stop that thought for a minute but let me let me come back and pick this how many knows uh that when uh what's more valuable than a billion dollars what's the most valuable thing that you can have the best thing that you can have outside of salvation amen and I thought you know I thought about Caleb over here you know they don't realize they just found the very bad they could be a billionaires but it wouldn't be as good as what you just found what does it say over there it talks about her fight prices far above rubies and all these other but her band makes a statement he says well your wife and or your husband is a bad thing that you can have outside of salvation I mean no sometimes sometimes we kind of neglect that thought don't we we don't realize how precious our mate is amen now that brings us to the spiritual aspect of it how many knows that more precious than the whole earth more precious than the whole galaxy more precious than anything else in God's eyes is his bride his church you know and we look at this we realize that this is a type now if you really want to get into it we're going to talk about a little bit with the invisible Union of Christ and the bride amen how that brother banham talk about Eve and how that's you uh hoard around and so forth with the serpent and all of this other stuff and and how the whole whole picture of the whole thing is about marriage all right it's about a husband and a wife amen but and he also talks about a wife and the way that she's made how that she's made very particular and in a special way amen oh my praise the Lord oh my now notice Let me just slow down here a little bit first of all he says marriage is the oldest institution in the world oh never instituted was marriage and let me ask you how many knows that you know we already know that strong thing it takes strong families to make anything strong whether it's a community or whether it's a nation Womanhood and motherhood not Womanhood many women out there but motherhood is the very backbone of the nation and so uh you know think about that of how that is the very strength that the institution that God instituted it because he knew that he would be the very strength when you break that you break everything now we're thinking as you study a lot of time you think of how evil people have gotten you know and and and homosexuality lesbianism and all this other stuff why I I guess you know I don't know about you better tell me but if I was wicked and bad and stuff I would just do all kinds of wicked and bad stuff and live with a woman live with her not never no man but listen I would not bother getting married why do they bother getting married it's a mockery it's blast beat me against God they wouldn't even have they're Wicked they're not even the category of having any kind of an honorable marriage it's the oldest institution and named make a mockery out of it I call it blasphemy against God because now God did not make Adam Eve he made Adam and Eve amen and look at it today look at where it's at just I I want to say leave Mary John of it Mary it's just supposed to be holy between one man and one woman holy and completely giving to each other and holy mat that ain't no holy matrimony that's Unholy but it's just blasphemy isn't it it's just making a mockery of it making a mockery of the family and it's gotten really bad isn't it oh my now notice I like this so he says in the woman I know this woman is entrusted with certain characters that she must not defile a woman is trusted with that there's not a creature on earth like a woman foreign now how many knows there's really only two women that the Bible talks about one she's called the great mother Harlot is that right and she's a harlot she's a Abominations of the Earth near Kings of the earth committed fornications with her and all these other things I've got some scriptures wrote down ones of just a filthy prostitute and the other one is the bride that has made herself ready there's two and if you really want to get a good scope of this listen to The Invisible Union but brother Banner brings it out and he brings it out about how in this generation what the churches have done now how many knows it tight now notice the church we know that the church is a type of the bride of Christ amen that's what the church is amen and I like this oh my now listen so we know that God had in mind he wanted the wife he wanted Fellowship he wanted communion isn't that right and oh if the people would have just realized in our day that that's why I said Malachi 4 to vindicate and prove that he's here and saying come on you know the wedding's ready to supper come on everybody who's ever will let him come invited everybody become his wife so to speak but they didn't want to have anything to do with it amen it was actually the love of God amen so first of all we realized that he also wanted to be a husband now just as he opened up the side of Adam and that right and he took out a rib oh my how many knows that anything God does is for a purpose and for a reason and others he did not just take flesh he didn't just take blood and flesh but he took a rip he took bone right oh I had to think as I was studying this I said you know amen somebody might say that you're ugly and you might say well Beauty's Only Skin Deep but you know I want you to understand with the bride of Jesus Christ that what we have goes all the way to the bow first of all if you're gonna be God's wife if God's gonna have a life it is going to have to be made in a special way he will never marry a harlot he will never marry a prostitute he'll never marry a flirt somebody that kisses and slops around with the world and his bride the church amen a woman is a very special vessel she is made in a special way I mean at least he's made in a special way there's no female like her there's none of them there's none made like him there's no dog like that there's no and no female of any kind entrusted with the character that the woman is a woman wasn't even in the beginning the original creation because God knowed that she would fall all other females could commit adultery she's the only one that can commit adultery every animal just does it for their babies at a certain time of the year and that's all they do it year after year same thing but the woman is entrusted and she's able to have it no matter how many times and how often and with whoever she's made that way basically what it is is she's been given a free moral agency she can pick right or she can pick wrong just like he was given a choice to pick right or to pick wrong she has to open up her mind to receive the devil's word how many please has the words of the Bride of Jesus Christ opens up heart opens up her mind to read God's word oh my not like that because he says she is flesh if my flesh she is bone of my bone amen his Bible talks about that we are Spirit of his Spirit where blood of his blood we're life of his life first flash of his flesh we're both foreign you have got to be made out of God himself material you can't be made out of denomina it has got to be broad material and that is only come out of the side of Christ came what blood and water any Spirit come out and you've got to be born of his spirit you can't be his bride any other way ah amen if you notice in Romans 7 means where brother Brandon went to to preach on the invisible Union and he got to talking about how that if a woman is married to another man while her husband liveth she shall be called an adulterous and brother bam says if a woman would do such a thing she forfeits her rights that God in heaven forfeits him right stood why because God's not going to live with a harlot or an indoctriness but that wasn't so much the point that he was making it natural he was making his point in his spiritual amen that the church world what they were doing they were they were slopping around with the world they were defiling themselves they were not keeping their virtue their virtue going to seminarians believing everything a seminar and everybody else to teach us over the word of God amen oh my there's certain things that the woman because her body is made in a special way she's the only one that can make and commit adultery she's got characters that she must not defile how many believes that the bride of Christ the Church of God you've got a character that you can must not defy [Music] her body was given to her but they're being obsessed amen a sacred trust from God no no dog no bird no other man no creature no she's the only one amen and the reason that it's secret oh I like this the reason that is sacred how many believe that as a Christian and then you have a certain uh a responsibility keep yourself hurt and I'll tell you why why is because that she listen the reason it's so sacred is because she is to bring forth life to the Earth [Applause] Glory let me know God wants to have sons and daughters amen and God does the man doesn't have the children the woman has the children the wife has the children Hallelujah and we know what happened in the garden of Ed he says how can you not see the the adultery in the Garden of Eden she had twins one of them was Cain of the wicked when the Bible says yes amen she was an adulteress but she is to bring life into the Earth her body is a betting grounds of life I may believe that he didn't have to sign half life he didn't have not the son have not life you and I are to bring forth God's children we're going to stop there because I want to come back to this here in a minute but let's first of all talk about him as now as a father how many knows these are Heavenly Father oh my aren't you glad he's my father he's my mother he's my sister he's my brother but he's our heavenly father we as see you know Revelations talks about seven heads and and horns and all these other things you know and sometimes it's kind of hard to understand but we can be his son we can also be his wife huh it may sound weird but it's not it's just a twofold thing you can deal with you as a child amen now let's look at this for a minute I wanna I wanna go ahead of this other for a minute let's talk about him dealing now when he becomes a father amen our heavenly father as a father husband father all right amen the man I read that in the scripture where it says the man is the head of the wife the man is the head of the house there's only one over the man and that's Christ isn't that right oh my what do you think about what everything how many know that whenever a family is running smooth ain't it nice Isn't it nice when the family is just running smooth husband and wife get along with two kids have happened but isn't it terrible huh when they're not getting along huh that's right you know you don't always get along you have disputes this out of the other not me meant for it to run smoothly it doesn't always but you gotta get iron things out like that but the responsible let's first off think about the husband father and the responsibility that comes with a husband or a father he is the head of it and I don't care what part of the family I don't care if it's just finances I don't care if it's uh emotions I don't care if it's your wife or no uh what kind of feeling she has what kind of needs she has or what kind of person she is like I said whether it's providing you know for the children everything in that household lands on the man [Applause] it's his responsibility even the problem said a wife will never answer for us but the husband will answer for the life folks if she's hot headed if she's not hard-headed no matter what it is you gotta deal with it it's yours it's your responsibility okay how heavy it gets how hard it gets you got to work through it folks we've had our spats oh we've had our spots I know what that's all about praise the Lord I know what it's like to have to come back and say I'm sorry honey example apologize huh I shouldn't handled it that way if you really look close you'd realize that when she got hot you're supposed to stay calm oh boy where's the back door here hey man you feel like you're cause we as human beings I don't care we always think but right it don't matter how wrong we are we have a built-in mechanism that makes us right that's why you can't hardly tell somebody anything because they've got it better they've got it different I don't even bother talking to them about it people like that huh but it's making mechanism we're right I was right all right well anyway that's free I didn't write that down in the script but I thought about that oh and when I think about the responsibility that God Almighty has when he takes me and when I say I do I forsake my mother my daddy my sister and my last whatever I have forsake them all to follow him and to marry him amen he I become his responsibility and he says you know don't you worry about what you're gonna eat or flow You're gonna laugh you're Heavenly Father those that you have need of these things and he's gonna Supply everything that you have need of and that's what got me to this message knowing that God is going to take care of you my God shall supply all your needs aren't you glad to have a Heavenly Father Like That amen not just in this world but in death and in the world to come he says respond that's about for you [Music] he wanted to be father I'm glad he's my father I'm glad he's my daddy amen Hallelujah I'm glad to have a father like him my and you shall find and it shall be opened unto you we are not the father can't always Supply things for our wife perhaps like we want to but this one can this one can supply everything that you have and he promised to do so now can he shall be over none to you for every one of you that ask us to receiveth and he that seeketh find us and he did not gonna it shall be opened unto you or what man is there of you whom his son shall ask bread will he give him a stone or if you ask a fish will he give him a serpent if he's not being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give you good thanks for them that asked him how many believe we just don't have the faith to ask for to see some time God help us he knows how to just fix you up right that's our heavenly father that is our daddy in the family hey aren't you glad come on just have a good old Jubilee you've got a daddy I promise he's gonna take care of you he will supply your every need I think you ever happened enough he's gonna take care of because he's your husband and your husband is responsible take care of you oh my Hallelujah you love that that's right oh my don't take any thought of saying well what are we going to eat what are we going to drink how are we going to be close for these things that's what the nations of the world seek after you heavenly father knoweth that you have need of the things how many knows let me just put that in there every aspect not just clothes and whatever but your heavenly father knows what you have need of how many times that we've prayed amen and it wasn't just a little bit later during was ask because I'm there why that was because he already knew that you had needed that the minute you asked damn it well praise be to God heavenly father I appreciate you heavenly father I appreciate you I love you I adore you about bow down before you heavenly father I appreciate you somebody appreciate him with me say heavenly father I appreciate you how about that oh come on what about mother how can he be a mother to us huh how could God be a mother to us he's my father he's my mother well Jesus said one place to Jerusalem all Jerusalem Jerusalem how I would I would hovered you as a hen thouser prude how would I have suck a job I would have taken care of you just like a mother takes care of her little chicks I would have taken care of you I mean I was just the love of God amen because as a father we know as a father he chastens us he corrects us he rebukes us chastises us amen but sometimes we need the mother's love don't we or a Brother's love or a sister's love but it is in this case a mother's love amen looking at let's look at him as mother for just a minute he's my mother that's right he's like ahead he takes care of every little every little detail of my life every detail of your life he cares about oh papa he's just kind of rough cut but Mama she's detailed about you let me tie that shoot let me teach you how to tie that shoe let me get that shirt on right huh very detailed oh my it's expressed amen I believe it was expressed amen as a mother whenever my that mother ran into that fire and saved her baby is that right ran into that fire that was the love of a mother gotta take care of that baby let me tell you how many knows that's the way God feels with his newborn children with his children amen I'm gonna take care of him I don't care if I gotta run into a fire he don't care what kind of a problem you're gonna have he's gonna to come down in the midst of your problem amen and help you out and Save you what did the Bible say is Oh What A Savior is mine wonderful glorious this husband that we have he is a wonderful savior father we have he's a wonderful savior mother it was a wonderful savior he saves the body he washes it amen he keeps it clean so what did it say that the woman is entrusted with a certain virtue and cleanliness what does a wife do a wife keeps the house clean isn't that right feeds the children amen but first oh my oh no I'll save that for last that's right she does that's what the church is how many knows he give prophets and evangelists and so forth for the perfecting of the search to keep it clean I believe he's got to keep the church clean well there's a people after God stay clean in our hearts amen how do we get fed by the foolishness of preaching or to feed the children the church feeds the children amen that's where responsibility praise be the God but if you're a dad you're a husband and a father sometimes you think well it's just a little overwhelming taking care of everything making sure everything is taken care of let me believe that's your responsibility it weighs heavy sometimes then I thought about God how does God feel all over the world his wife his children all of it how many knows he's responsible for making sure that she's without spot that she's without wrinkle it's his job to wash Us by the washing of the Water by the word amen let me tell you something the church world the false Church she doesn't get Washed by the Water of the word she refuses the word that would wash her and make her clean amen my but I'm so glad to be part of God's child amen keep yourself pure for her husband and so forth amen all right how about a brother let's look at him for a few minutes as a brother amen in Hebrews 2 Hebrews 2 foreign there was another one that I didn't write down um ah maybe I tagged it maybe I did John 15 14. 10 15 14. yeah I did tag it I didn't write it down but I did take it we'll go to that next Hebrews 2 and verse 11 for both he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified are all one how many knows if that's what he's doing to his church he's sanctified for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren amen I'm really glad that he's your brother that's right saying I will declare unto you my brother my name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God hath given me for as much then as children children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that's who death he might destroy him that had power over death that is the devil and to deliver them whose deaths were all their lifetimes subject to bondage for barely he took not on him the nature of angels but took him on the seat of Abraham wherever ain't all things it behooves him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest and things pertaining unto God and to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he for in that he himself suffered being tempted that he is able to sucker them that are tempted how many's got to have a brother that understands you that you can have fellowship with that you can talk to that you can open up a power and that's goddess the same story as uh Ruth and Boaz he became Kinsman to us he became one of us don't think so chapter 4 15 of Saint John says ye are my friends amen if ye do whatsoever thinks this is friendship now I didn't mean to go there but here we are yeah my friends if you do whatever I command you henceforth I call you not servants for the servant noeth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father have I made known unto you amen so now notice how it says that he said that he became our brother he became as she became of Deceit Abraham and in the story of Ruth and Boaz we know that there was one that was closer kin isn't that right there was one closer to kin to Ruth than what Boaz was amen he had to go and he had to make known to the public and everybody hey do you want to redeem her and he couldn't redeem her isn't that right because he would have martyred at what he had going on let me tell you something he can't redeem God's children and so he went there and Boaz redeemed to Ruth praise be to God and that's where it was with Jesus amen you and I were closer related to the devil the Bible says that we are uh had our conversation at the Times past according to the Flesh and the prince of the power of the air and we're by Nature the children of disobedience isn't that right so we had a closer relationship to the devil but guess what God come down and he paid for our sin he come and redeemed us back and said look not only are you my brother you're now my brother he's my father he's my mother he's my brother aren't you glad for him being your brother but you know what stick is closer than the brother a friend one place that says his friend sticketh closer than a brother not that God is not completely sticking with you but it's just that you know when you have a friend you can consult with them you can talk to them you can tell them about anything and they'll be a friend amen and that's what Jesus said he says you know now you're you're my friends amen I don't call you servants anymore because I'm going to tell you what did he say he says uh but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of the father have I made known and unto you praise the lord it's kind of like a like mother Brown said in our invisible Union I believe it was hard that how that God was whispering love secrets to his bride how many believe that that's why he was whispering love secrets to his bride telling her you know I had my eye on you from the very beginning I knew way way back I knew that it was gonna be late with love at first sight I knew he was gonna be my wife world just love Secrets like that boy isn't that nice to know that he now most of the people thought well the only reason that I'm a Christian is because I chose to be a Christian and then God chose me on that night that I gave my heart to the altar and if I mess up I may not become oh I made me get thrown out but how would you like a love secret like that but you're relying on yourself and so no how many knows we have the kind of love Secrets he even had the begun a good work in you is able to perform it if he started the work he's gonna finish it but you got to be made of his things of his flesh of his blood blood amen praise be to God is good amen praise the Lord that's right you know brother bam talked about Mary and Elizabeth and how they would come and how they would hug each other and greet each other and have real sisterly love amen now I'm not a sister so I can't really speak as a sister but I do know that there's some real genuine sweetness that goes on between sisters and a lot of times listen even between uh sisters or even girls that are friends not nice or or guys that are friends huh you can put your shoulder on them you give them a hug and love them you know this out of the other real genuine friendship isn't that nice yeah that's the way it was with Christ but you know the way the world's got it nowadays but I'm talking about love and and so forth he says you know but now with that brother or whatever goes too far with that and they got a pervert it that's not love brother Brandon remember how he talked about there's different degrees of love there's a agape love there's Ophelia love there's a perverted love there's a lust huh there's just all kinds of that mess they call it love let me tell you people those people that are totally Antichrist and everything well God loves us all no you got the wrong kind of love because I'll tell you what if God really does love you he would smack you upside your face and tell you you better straighten up but I'll send you soul to hell ah he would correct you wouldn't he that's the real kind of love you first straighten him out not oh I'm just going to take everybody on in no I mean he's not oh man when I think about that when I think about that and how did the world and where they have gone to praise be to God how perverted the love is out there absolute perversion it's sad isn't it to think of what they have made amen you know my wife was reading me something off of YouTube I guess or something like on the way to church and she laughed and so forth and I think it was one of our relatives said something about he says if I have children I sure hope that they're really if they're you know homeschooled and and the world thinks you know that when you're homeschooled that you're you're weird he says well I hope my child is the weirdest thing that they've ever seen because in the public schools they're walking down the Halls now acting like chickens and ducks and animals and now that's really weird who's the weird one here huh oh my praise be to God praise be the Lord God you love him this tonight amen he became us he became my brother he became our friend what a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and griefs to Bear what a privilege it is to carry Everything To God In Prayer how many believes he is a real friend folks amen absolutely a real friend praise the Lord I want to I want to come down to the end of this and I want to dwell on something else for just a minute amen and that is what it is said that a real family is to be and how that the wife of course being the type of the church and so forth how that she is to be the betting ground for life how many believe that she is to bring forth children of God and that's how the whole program goes why do you think that they're after our kids in the school how many agrees that this is a layout as your age and what they're doing is they're come completely blind to the fact that the devil is absolutely using them destroy civilization destroy Society destroy the home destroy the marriage one of the greatest it was it was a milestone of iniquity whenever the Supreme Court ruled that there could be a marriage acknowledged between two men or two women when they acknowledge that because if I'm not wrong uh even the liberal very liberal Mr Clinton acknowledged that marriage is to be between a man and a woman look how far they've gone even the Supreme Court now and changing it and so forth amen but destroying the family unit and you know God the devil's trying to do the same thing Amen in in God's church and God's people is to destroy that's all he knows how to do is destroy amen and I believe that it's a virtue it's something that you and I amen we have to say God help me Lord Jesus because the Sons and Daughters of God amen now notice and he talks about a woman having a baby now listen he says now if a woman won't have a baby for her husband she'll take a dog or a cat or child to her husband than to raise it to the service of God that's entirely out of these false churches lying amen she'll be so disgraced if she did our sin loving Society of 1965 type of woman amen a true picture of the modern church now how many knows that the Brother Band said the women out there in the world is a type of the worldly Church a type of that world Church of what is in it amen and if that's the case boy we're in a bad shape aren't we a true picture of the modern church today neither does this modern Church won any of these little here screaming and shouting and tongue speakings Acts 2 38 young ones around her hey man but how many knows that's the only kind that really God produces as far as any more book of Acts of anything any child gets born he's going to act the same way they did oh my she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming and Hate amen that's Hallelujah they like it's cold they like it stiff they like it dry they don't want to hear too much they don't like the real fire why is it burn them hey man they're like those your wiggle Tails brother by them said you know they belong to being an old sister and some old dead Church they love to be in there icicles hanging from the ceiling there ain't no hallelujah oh my you're going to say among some of the mamas you Hallelujah I praise them they would kick you out huh but think about it she don't want any of them kind oh my but listen listen that's right why such a child would immediately put me put out of her denomination oh my God they had one like that in one of the churches where they throw her out right quick why would you let that they would say why that's small but you see she's pregnant it was something because she's bringing forth members all the time oh my listen to this let me let me jump down here and I'll pick that up now I know another thing he says notice what kind of children should she's bearing that's what they are amen who is that Papa that's right what kind of Papa they have whether it's from the first Adam or the second Adam if the church brings forth a child of the second Adam he has the second Adam's way of acting like the way they did on Pentecost that just a real true second Adam's children how many knows that he came that he because his father he wanted to bring many sons like himself according to Romans 8 chapter that he might be the first born among many Brethren how many believes if you're a child of God you're going to act like a child of God if you got the Holy Ghost you're going to act like the Holy Ghost anything else is adultery everything else is a hypocrite that's uh you know because even describe the Pharisees said oh they look like they were but inside they were full of dead men's bones that's the way it is in the church world today I'll tell you what the outside sometimes it might look alright but inside you're full of dead man's bone the outside don't even look right listen to me that that false church amen she loved their Master they love their God they love their husband and their husband is the devil he lets them do anything they want to they can come up here to our character wear pants they can wear this out of the other they can wear makeup they can cut their hair the women are even allowed to preach let me tell you something the pre the women are lying in the Presbyterian and the Nazarene Church up here even that even my own Banker up there soapies as you know they were having a debate whether they were let homosexuals preach and so forth can you imagine Newton while they opened it up first they left word by saying that women could preach and so forth now they got homosexuals nothing else now you see why the Bible says she said the mother of Harlot full of the Abominations and filthiness of her fornication claiming to be married to Christ but filthy beyond belief adulterer see that's what it's all about that's what it was all about at the beginning that's what it's all about at the end spiritual fornications that's why people commit spiritual fornication oh my sad isn't it oh my second that am I like this oh my that did on the day of Pentecost that's the true second Adam's children that's right the nature is like his amen yes sir now her daughters painted face bobbed head women wearing men's clothes sizes causers the Bible said for not to do it she cuts her hair it's a shame to her and so forth you say shut up on that that's what they were bird says I'm pointing out to the nature how many piece that you got to look at the nature of a person you're natured tells you what you are oh my let me let she's pregnant with something that's sure enough but what is it man's ideas man's Creeds man's Darkness and I'll tell you what if you want to get stagnated and you want to oh my lovers of stagnation is what they call it they're loud the wiggle Tails they can't live in fresh water but their ancest and that real flowing water they don't want no Artesian while they don't want no preacher up here preaching under the ends preaching calling Sin Sin and this wrong and that wrong if you do this and you do that it tells you that's not where you ought to be with God they don't want to do that day to be awful uncomfortable sitting around here with a mini skirt on Rubble around here hey man with short hair with makeup on Bible says not to cut her hair Bible Paul said he said you know that a woman is supposed to be silent she is forbidden to speak in church if she has a question go home and ask her husband amen but but they do it anyway you know what the Bible you know what Paul also said he said if a angel from heaven come and preach anything different than what we have brought you let it be accurs foreign so what is it when you go contrary to that word you're cursed you're an adult that's not a part of the family of God my God is not going to marry an adultererness I believe every one of us has to watch what we do what we listen to and that because you don't want to commit spiritual fornications against almighty God you are responsible to keep your vessel holy amen keep the fire of almighty God in it so that you can bring forth some children I've heard said before you know it's a pastor's job to go out there and win souls and somebody else said you're the shepherd amen he doesn't have the baby sheep it's the sheep that have sheep good point right but I am a sheep too so we can have we can have but you know it's a good point right I mean every one of us should be in the four children bringing forth that's what it's all about bringing forth children what a beautiful thing is to have a family to have children mine ah remember the two brothers the one went and played the stock market and got super rich got super much another brother he had a wife and about seven eight twelve children I don't know how many it was and all kind of raggedy dressed and barely making it from the week to week you know and but they were happy together and he loved each other the brother with all the money come back and he said man you don't realize what you got well having a family where loves with one another is more valuable than all the money in the world folks amen but especially being a part of the family of God how many of these have to be a part of the family of God to have to know amen that you're married to a man amen that is absolutely going to take care of you you ain't got to worry about nothing no let me tell you something I might you know if I if wife our wife gets anxious it's out of the other you know we asked if you go up and put our arms around what's wrong honey what's wrong let's talk about this what's going on huh right and that's the way is our heavenly father when we get action when we get this guy Heavenly Father don't want us anxious don't want us to be nervous you don't want to be upset how many knows you God we want a happy wife a happy life God wants a happy wife I read that scripture because he says you know if God loves you if God loves us he's loving himself the Bible says you know that he a husband if you really love you right you'll cherish it nourish it and cherish it because you're actually doing it to yourself you're making life better for yourself amen and it is the same way about God I mean it was God nourishes us he cherishes us he'll get evangelists he'll get this person that person to get your pastor to say things that you need that you need nourish you amen who's coming to church tonight and says boy I'm glad to be going to church I thought what about people that don't go to church I said and I thought I'm going to tell the church you know what if you're in church tonight you gave the devil a black eye yeah you gave the devil a black eye because you made it to church because the devil don't want you to come to church he'll give you every reason every excuse possible to not be in church like this is where God is all the Believers gather the word of God comes forth God speaks not that he can't speak through the internet and so forth but that's still not the same amen we won't go there too much but you could right people that can be and don't here I go you just need more lovely ghosts you just need more of the Holy Ghost what you need ah thank you Lord I'll say it if you've got God in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open that's what the problem of God said amen praise be to God once again she's pregnant wait it was something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want any of them screaming and hollering and blabbering Acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would embarrass her but let me tell you something mama you know and then when you're screaming and you're hollering your amen you're not a miserable person you're they're the ones that's miserable hey man the layout is he is a rich increases now I needed nothing blind poor men they're the ones that are miserable ratchet make it miserable ones having a better great weight of sinning and guilt on their Hearts Alive folks I wanted you to know something you don't have to carry around guilt you don't have to carry around no way to sin amen you need to drop it at the altar you need to drop it at the pets in store and say God take this off of me give me some Joy give me some happiness that God wants his children happy there's nothing more than it makes a parent happy amen when they see their children happy and they'll go to extremes they'll do anything they'll buy on this they're doing that though Cracker Barrel they need to defeat them right anything you're trying to keep their children happy isn't that right that's the way God is with you tonight my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Christ Jesus us human fathers are fallible huh

whatever it was and got that crosshairs down on her because she made that little bear sound and brought a little baby out there Mama come out there better than that but she wanted to watch out and she wanted to see where her baby was she didn't care if it was going to cost her life can we say something amen Jesus Christ didn't care if he was going to cost his life on Calvary but he was gonna save his child okay aren't you glad that he did he didn't care what kind of ammunition or what the devil was going to throw at him and what it's going to cost him but he was going to save that child he's going to save you let me tell you something in every problem everything you ever encounter in this world God is going to see dirt that you get through it that you make it he's an awesome provider he's a caregiver both primary caregiver of his body of his children and not his wife greatest family ever one of these days we're going to get to go home and be with him amen we're going to be with our heavenly father throughout the ceaseless ages of Eternity I love it I'll just touch on a little bit going another half hour but better bam talked about in Romans 7 . he says you've got to die to your first husband in order to be married to the second husband You Gotta Die to your first nature he says if your first nature is not dead or you're living in adultery if you're still married and giving uh you know giving in to that first husband amen amen then you'll be called in the daughters and he said about these churches he ain't no way you can belong to man-made denomination and be the Bride of Jesus Christ at the same time he said he ain't possible and you didn't really hear brother Ben I'm saying those things earlier in the ministry but we preach the invisible Union I believe it was a turning point he says come out of here you can't be a part of it because you get part of a harlot amen and try claim to be the Bride of Jesus Christ at the same time amen come out of her my people about be they used to take part to take not of her sins amen and then he goes on to say it he says you know that if you believe every word and you have come and give you yourself 100 to Christ and he has watched you by the water of the word if he's washed you by the water or the message is in power because I'm gonna know if this is the only message that'll cleanse you now I have no Presbyterian or Baptist or any kind of message you're going to cleanse you they only preach a historical God we preach a present God isn't that right amen this message is what's going to wash you hard it's gonna justify you amenities if you believe in every world and if you're pure and you're the unadulterated pure virtuous everything that the Bible said he was going to help he says that's what you are if you believe in every job every channel living his life for him amen and the holy spirit's on the inside of you and it's no you have never done it in the first place at first for us but if that the denominational husband is dead it's that first nature is dead now he don't remember it no more it's in the sea of forgetfulness and he went into two books amen that Daniel saw the books were open two books your book of life their natural course then another book where your name is on the lamp Book of Lies amen you want to be on that second book folks part of that second book in that first book Is erased isn't that what brother bam seen whenever he was seen on that book you know he had booked all of his stuff on it all of his life all of his mistakes he was accusing that woman of oh boy look at this low life opened this restaurant hello he says now you you did all of these things I have pardoned you but you want to keep her guilty look at that book full of stuff it's pardoned it's all in the sea of God's forgetfulness that's what we want to be amen God bless you stand with me tonight thank you all for praying for me amen I just I thought about God's Providence and how did he want it and desired actually the very quote that I wanted to start with I completely forgot to bring out here but that God desired a family of his own amen and when he was pierced on Calvary how many knows what
