[35:21] series amen and looking at the
[35:23] attributes of God Amen and what he is
[35:27] amen
[35:28] and just to try to express a little bit
[35:32] amen amen feel so when you think about
[35:35] God and how great he is and all that he
[35:38] is well it just makes me feel like my my
[35:41] my how how what a little sliver whatever
[35:43] we could say or do would just be a

[35:51] could really grasp amen the awesomeness
[35:54] of our God Amen how many believes we
[35:56] serve an awesome God amen and so um
[36:00] praise the Lord I'm just glad to be his
[36:02] aren't you glad to be a child of the
[36:05] king Luke 4 and
[36:07] verse
[36:09] 17 but let's go with 16 and he came to
[36:13] nazarus Luke 4 and verse 16 and he came
[36:17] to Nazareth where he had been brought up
[36:21] and as his custom was he went into the
[36:23] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[36:26] up for to read and there was delivered
[36:28] unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah
[36:31] and when he opened the book he found the
[36:33] place where it was written the spirit of
[36:34] the Lord is upon me because he has
[36:37] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[36:39] poor and he has sent me to heal the
[36:40] brokenhearted to preach
[36:42] Deliverance captives and the recovering
[36:44] of the sight of the blind amen and to
[36:47] set at Liberty them that are bruised to
[36:49] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[36:51] amen God bless the reading of the word
[36:54] you can be seated amen we found a little
[36:57] a little bit later as he sat the book
[36:59] down amen that he said this day this
[37:02] scripture is
[37:03] fulfilled in your ears amen tonight we
[37:08] want to look at the mighty deliverer
[37:10] amen how many believes that God one of
[37:12] the attributes of almighty God is that
[37:14] he is a
[37:16] deliverer
[37:17] amen praise the Lord amen you know and
[37:22] uh you know as we go through these
[37:23] things we think about them you know
[37:25] because uh until you really really
[37:29] experience uh the reality of the essence
[37:32] of God it's still I might just say a
[37:35] figment of your
[37:37] imagination amen Ain that right it might
[37:40] just be something that you know
[37:43] mentally but once you experience what
[37:46] God is it makes all the difference in
[37:48] the world amen amen so tonight with the
[37:52] help of the lord we want to look at the
[37:54] deliverance and and things that God
[37:56] allows and the that he does things and
[37:59] and uh you know to to deliver amen
[38:02] because for realize Deliverance of
[38:03] course amen he brings Deliverance to the
[38:06] captive so before you can be delivered
[38:08] of something you've got to amen be uh
[38:11] like that little crow that brother
[38:13] Braham talked about I believe it was
[38:14] Johnny Crow got the farmer tied up a't
[38:16] that right and he was tied up and just
[38:18] went circles and circles and circles and
[38:20] all of a sudden some kind of man come by
[38:22] am me untied
[38:24] him and I untied that Crow and said come
[38:28] on let's go let's go let's go let's go
[38:29] and he didn't know any better but he
[38:31] just kept circling and circling he was
[38:35] free but he didn't know he was
[38:38] free amen and that's the way it is with
[38:41] Jesus Christ when he went and died on
[38:44] Calvary he set everybody
[38:47] free how many knows it's all free
[38:50] everybody set
[38:52] free amen and Jesus said who the son has
[38:56] set free is free
[38:59] indeed I like that praise the Lord
[39:01] another brother I was studying a little
[39:03] bit and brother B was talking about how
[39:04] that the word washed means loosed and he
[39:08] use it for the Colt untied a colt and
[39:10] Lazarus loose him loose the grip of
[39:12] death let him free set it free something
[39:15] that's tied up bound down ain't that
[39:19] right amen and then after it's set free
[39:22] let go amen it's not captive anymore
[39:27] praise the
[39:29] Lord amen praise the
[39:33] Lord over in uh I'll just go to it right
[39:36] quick you don't have to follow if you
[39:38] don't want but in Psalms 103 1 through3
[39:40] says bless the Lord oh my soul and all
[39:43] that is with me within me bless His holy
[39:46] name bless the Lord oh my soul and
[39:48] forget not all his
[39:50] benefits amen who G forgiveth all thine
[39:54] iniquities and who Health all of thy
[39:56] disease Jesus how many that's part of
[39:59] the benefits of
[40:02] Christ
[40:04] amen when we think about what Christ did
[40:06] for us on Calvary and how that he is and
[40:09] we understand him and we feel him and
[40:11] and know him as our personal savior
[40:14] right how many knows and knows Christ as
[40:17] your personal
[40:19] savior amen if you uh don't know him as
[40:22] your personal savior amen then you
[40:24] probably don't know what it's like to be
[40:26] set free from
[40:28] sin amen you just don't know what it's
[40:31] like but if you know what it's like to
[40:33] be for set free from sin then you know
[40:36] what it's like to be set free from
[40:39] condemnation and if you're free from sin
[40:41] and condemnation you have peace in your
[40:44] heart amen you also understand that the
[40:47] benefits of getting Christ in your heart
[40:50] it isn't just one benefit it has a whole
[40:52] bunch of
[40:54] benefits amen I want you to know that

[40:59] he saves your soul amen he is not just a

[41:05] deliverer he is your husband and if he
[41:09] is your husband guess what whenever a
[41:12] man takes a responsibility of a woman

[41:19] completely responsible for her how
[41:21] many's glad that he knows all about your
[41:24] need he's responsible for you that's

[41:52] with you he's got to go through him
[41:55] first amen I'm thankful ful for
[41:58] that praise the Lord so um my my when I
[42:01] think about it and I would love to go
[42:03] through these things because it's just
[42:05] not a reality to people is that right
[42:09] the fact that he saved them a't that
[42:12] right now we all know that I was
[42:16] thinking about this
[42:18] that we were all in the devil's pawn
[42:22] shop how many knows when Adam sinned he
[42:26] for fed
[42:28] everything that title deed went back to
[42:31] God and then guess what the devil had
[42:34] rights on Adam and
[42:36] Eve he had rights we all went into the
[42:40] devil's pawn shop so to
[42:42] speak amen and God couldn't just carry
[42:45] out a rescue
[42:48] operation huh he couldn't just come in
[42:52] there and take it back you know like
[42:55] maybe of Iran and or somebody has our
[42:58] has our hostages or whatever amen and we
[43:01] get our Green Beret we get our oh we get
[43:03] the best of the best we go in there and

[43:07] everything and we bring in our
[43:09] helicopters and our gunships and shoot
[43:12] everybody comes close we get our people
[43:16] out but that's not what God did no
[43:19] because the devil had a right he had you
[43:21] in his pawn shop and he had a right to
[43:24] have you and there had to be a a price
[43:29] paid in other words he held us Ransom he
[43:33] held us Ransom and the ransom money had
[43:36] to be
[43:37] paid amen and aren't you glad that Jesus

[43:42] Ransom amen and now he goes into the pwn

[50:59] be
[51:00] free that's
[51:02] right all right let me get to something
[51:06] that I've preached on millions of times
[51:09] I think and I've got something new off
[51:11] out of it again you all ready for
[51:14] that it's about
[51:17] trials something new about
[51:20] trials
[51:22] amen all right now we'll get to that in
[51:25] a second but let me first of all say
[51:28] this that he's a specialist how many
[51:30] know that God is a
[51:34] specialist when you go to a doctor and
[51:36] he says well look I know what it is but
[51:39] I'm not just a specialist in that I you
[51:41] need something by somebody knows more
[51:43] about it than I do
[51:46] amen and so when they can't handle it
[51:49] more they put it to a specialist and God
[51:51] is a
[51:54] specialist brother Brandon preach a
[51:56] message is called the darkest hour then
[51:59] Jesus
[52:02] comes and if you remember I'll just
[52:04] start here with Mary and Martha when
[52:07] Jesus when Lazarus got sick isin't that
[52:11] right and he passed away it says even
[52:14] Jesus himself said that this is not unto
[52:17] death this is to bring honor and glory
[52:19] to God and it was to be glorifying Jesus
[52:23] Christ it was to bring God glory
[52:26] amen and he went even after he stayed at
[52:29] a certain place after they send the word
[52:31] to him and then it says he went over
[52:34] into next city I forget the name of it
[52:35] Judea or somewhere not Judea but anyway
[52:38] the next city the disciples says man why
[52:40] do you want to go back there they want
[52:41] it to kill you last time he went
[52:43] there amen and I believe the brother B
[52:46] says he went even further
[52:48] away amen and then he tells his
[52:50] disciples you know let's go back to see
[52:52] Lazarus because he's
[52:54] sleeping Thomas I believe was or one of
[52:57] them said well if he sleeps he's doing
[52:58] good he needs a
[53:00] nap that's what they thought it was
[53:02] sleeping well if he's doing good like
[53:05] the rest of us when we're taking a nap
[53:06] we're doing pretty
[53:08] good that's right but he said no no no
[53:11] no no he's
[53:14] dead oh my Thomas Thomas says well let's
[53:17] go on back and let's go back and die
[53:19] with
[53:21] him amen but anyway they all went back
[53:25] and came back back and came to a certain
[53:27] town or close to where Lazarus was
[53:29] Martha found out about and she come
[53:30] running to him wherever he was she come
[53:33] out to him he says she said you know if
[53:34] you would have been here Lazarus would
[53:37] not have
[53:39] died how many appreciates whenever IM me
[53:42] that brother Tommy talked about it I've
[53:44] I've seen it many times in my own life
[53:46] amen you want to fix something or you
[53:48] need something and immediately God
[53:50] answers you right there and there it is
[53:51] and you're like woo God is
[53:54] quick I like God it's just right there
[53:56] there and how many believes God cares
[53:57] about the intricate parts of your
[54:00] life he
[54:02] does Amen but a lot of times a lot of
[54:07] times it seems like that God waits till
[54:10] it's too
[54:13] late
[54:15] amen I thought about titling this better
[54:17] late than
[54:20] never because we have that phrase you
[54:23] know at least you're late but at least
[54:24] that's better than never
[54:27] that was kind of Martha's situation he
[54:28] says you know you're a little
[54:31] late but even now whatever you ask God
[54:34] to give it to
[54:35] you and he says Martha he's going to
[54:37] rise again Martha says oh yeah I know
[54:40] he's going to rise he's going to rise at
[54:42] the
[54:44] resurrection and guess what Jesus said
[54:46] he looked at her and said I am the
[54:50] resurrection and I am the life woo
[54:55] Glory you know I was praying the other
[54:57] day and I was praying to God lord you
[54:59] see our circumstance Lord can you hear
[55:01] us will you hear us do you hear us can
[55:04] you hear me Lord Hear My Cry hear me
[55:09] Lord you know what I got
[55:12] back he says what are you talking
[55:15] about you talking
[55:18] about if you've got the Holy Ghost I'm
[55:22] not off somewhere I I'm here I I hear
[55:25] you
[55:27] how many believes that that's right he's
[55:30] there he's listening he not off
[55:32] somewhere off if you've got the Holy
[55:34] Ghost just talk to him he knows he hears
[55:38] you amen I thought that thank you Lord
[55:42] so many times we're reaching out into
[55:44] the star somewhere when he's a lot
[55:45] closer to you than what you
[55:48] think
[55:50] amen he
[55:52] understands but in that case it seemed
[55:55] like he it was so late and it was such a
[55:59] dark hour you know
[56:05] because it have been so much different
[56:08] if Jesus would have come right
[56:10] away and prayed for him and he did just
[56:12] not
[56:13] died amen but so many times we think
[56:18] well we'll believe till the last breath
[56:20] hey I want you to understand something
[56:22] God's there he's still God after the
[56:24] last breath he's still God as a matter
[56:28] of fact but it seems like he's he was
[56:30] four days
[56:32] late we might say he was already and
[56:34] bombed he was already in Tomb can you
[56:37] imagine brother the Tommy go digging
[56:39] somebody up out of the
[56:42] Grave how many people would be skeptic
[56:44] of
[56:46] you ain't that right there'd be so many
[56:48] people skeptic but brother Bram says if
[56:50] God told me to go raise Abraham Ling I'd
[56:52] invite the world
[56:56] that's right amen tell you what if I'd
[57:00] have been back
[57:02] there here's a tricky question if I'd
[57:04] have been back there if you'd have been
[57:06] back there what would you have
[57:09] done I'd have said where are we going
[57:12] where's it at I'm GNA be there I just
[57:14] said I believe
[57:16] it how can you say that how can I say
[57:19] that because we didn't see a lot of
[57:21] those Miracles that way but we believe
[57:23] anyway and if you believe now you would
[57:25] have believe back
[57:27] [Applause]
[57:30] there but all those other people back
[57:32] there they wouldn't believe it but if
[57:34] you believe now you to believe back
[57:36] then I to believe Moses's message I to
[57:39] believe Noah's message I didn't believe
[57:41] Jesus's message I didn't believe John
[57:43] the Baptist's message I didn't believe
[57:45] Paul's message cuz I believe it now
[57:48] [Applause]
[57:57] that's
[57:58] right that don't make it jump a little I
[58:01] don't know what
[58:02] will that don't make a Baptist shout
[58:04] don't know what will
[58:06] right Amen to think that if you have the
[58:09] capacity to believe and not see now if
[58:14] you'd have been there you'd have
[58:17] believed you'd have been one of those
[58:19] Believers not a
[58:21] doubter but a
[58:24] Believer amen
[58:31] man I'm going to read you something
[58:33] that seems
[58:36] cruel it seems cruel of
[58:41] God but this cruelness as what we might
[58:45] think is his
[58:47] specialty it's his
[58:53] specialty didn't brother Braham say look
[58:56] if it had been a Pentecostal there and
[58:58] said of Martha they said they to give
[59:00] Jesus a piece of their mind you know
[59:03] what he said he says you know here we
[59:05] have followed you we've believed
[59:07] everything you done and me when we ask
[59:09] something of you we won't even
[59:12] come
[59:14] huh that's it I'm done I'm out of here
[59:18] is what a lot of them would have
[59:20] said amen how many those there is that
[59:23] class out there there a whole lot of
[59:25] them like that
[59:30] amen but if that had been
[59:37] Pentecostals
[59:39] amen but not Martha she didn't give him
[59:42] peace of my mind his M she says even now
[59:46] whatever you ask really he believe that
[59:49] God will do
[59:52] it you see the thing about God is
[59:57] the reason that he specializes and I
[59:59] want to call him The
[1:00:01] Specialist of impossible
[1:00:04] impossibilities amen a specialist of
[1:00:10] impossibilities so he lets it go he let
[1:00:13] Lazarus go is that
[1:00:16] right let Lazarus go embalmed 4 days
[1:00:21] late amen
[1:00:26] let me read you a
[1:00:31] quote but before I do let me tell you
[1:00:34] one more story and I love this story of
[1:00:36] how God delivered the children of Israel
[1:00:39] out of Egypt right with a mighty hand
[1:00:42] delivered
[1:00:43] them Mighty hand of Deliverance what a
[1:00:47] hand it was Pharaoh felt it all of his
[1:00:52] army dead in the sea ouch it really hurt
[1:00:57] when God whooped him it was really
[1:01:00] painful but he delivered him with a
[1:01:02] mighty hand how many times the Bible
[1:01:05] talks about how that God delivers with a
[1:01:07] mighty hand
[1:01:11] amen and then the first
[1:01:14] thing let me just read it here come the
[1:01:17] children of Israel walking in the light
[1:01:18] Moses going on before him there they was
[1:01:21] come on this is the way God's calling
[1:01:24] we're going out we're going out to the
[1:01:26] promised land oh Hallelujah and they all
[1:01:29] there they all was shouting and jumping
[1:01:32] and having a good
[1:01:34] time
[1:01:37] amen you know and the first thing you
[1:01:39] know they look back and said what's that
[1:01:44] dust huh and one of them climbed up on
[1:01:47] the hill and said oh my last it's
[1:01:49] Pharaoh's
[1:01:51] Army amen and God said what are you so
[1:01:54] scared about didn't you believe me what
[1:01:57] I did down there what you so worried
[1:02:03] about why are you so worried why do you
[1:02:06] make me
[1:02:08] angry when they got down there Moses
[1:02:11] went out and interceded to
[1:02:13] God and of course he opened up the Red
[1:02:16] Sea and they walk through closed the
[1:02:18] enemy
[1:02:19] in now notice that's the way God does
[1:02:22] don't get scared don't get excited don't
[1:02:24] get flustered
[1:02:26] or you
[1:02:28] provoke
[1:02:30] god brother bam says for someone that
[1:02:33] had heard did provoke brother B says how
[1:02:36] many knows that the Israelites provoke
[1:02:39] god with their
[1:02:41] unbelief they made God angry so God
[1:02:44] Specializes in putting you in places you
[1:02:47] can't get out of there is black and as
[1:02:50] Bleak as
[1:02:53] possible and if you murmur and complain
[1:02:57] God's angry with
[1:03:03] you sure you want to be a
[1:03:07] Christian
[1:03:09] huh you'll put Place put you in places
[1:03:12] where it looks as black as dark as can
[1:03:15] be that's right and then if you murmur
[1:03:17] or complain it provokes God that isn't
[1:03:21] that what I just read that's right
[1:03:23] brother bandam said it why do you make
[1:03:25] me angry
[1:03:27] they murmur they complain that's right
[1:03:31] woo the Lord now are you ready for what
[1:03:34] I was talking about a while ago seems
[1:03:36] cruel listen to this when they got out
[1:03:39] there in their Journey just converted
[1:03:41] and brought out then the first thing you
[1:03:43] know they got in
[1:03:45] trouble God loves to bring you in
[1:03:53] trouble he loves to bring you into
[1:03:56] trouble I don't want to hear that you
[1:03:58] don't want to hear that but God loves to
[1:04:00] do it that's exactly
[1:04:06] right he loves to put trouble down and
[1:04:09] see what you'll do about
[1:04:14] it Glory this is what my new revelation
[1:04:17] is is that it's never about the
[1:04:23] test it's never about the
[1:04:26] trial right it's always about your
[1:04:30] reaction to the trial that God is
[1:04:32] looking
[1:04:35] for that's right give him a hand why God
[1:04:38] looks for your reaction see how you will
[1:04:41] react he can use anything he can do
[1:04:44] anything use any trial test but that's
[1:04:46] not the point the point that God is
[1:04:48] looking for is your
[1:04:51] [Music]
[1:04:53] reaction my reaction
[1:04:56] trust me I
[1:04:57] know amen I know what I'm talking
[1:05:04] abouten amen it's not always easily
[1:05:08] grasped
[1:05:10] hello
[1:05:11] amen it's not really
[1:05:14] gotten
[1:05:18] amen and let me just share with you I
[1:05:21] hope I can express this in the right way
[1:05:22] this will be a real lesson for us
[1:05:25] another lesson your heavenly father is
[1:05:28] teaching your pastor
[1:05:31] amen and that
[1:05:34] is when you think about this it's not
[1:05:37] about the test but it's about your
[1:05:41] reaction and I want to I'm here to tell
[1:05:44] you the hard part is not to
[1:05:49] test the battle isn't the test the
[1:05:53] battle isn't the hard part or of the
[1:05:56] test the real how can I express
[1:06:00] this the real battle the hardest part of
[1:06:04] any
[1:06:06] trial is overcoming not the
[1:06:10] trial but
[1:06:15] yourself that's the hardest
[1:06:17] part your mind right brother Glenn you
[1:06:20] know been there done that the thoughts
[1:06:23] that come through your mind the
[1:06:25] imagination that come through your
[1:06:27] mind
[1:06:31] amen cuz you you can only imagine the
[1:06:34] imaginations that I have with my wife
[1:06:38] hello
[1:06:40] and where it goes if you go down that
[1:06:44] road hello the hardest part for
[1:06:48] me is overcoming
[1:06:53] fear oh boy the Lord knows how they
[1:06:55] teach you a lesson you know I preached
[1:06:58] not so long ago how that people love
[1:07:01] power and and God is a god of power and
[1:07:03] we talk about how that mankind loves to
[1:07:05] go to these tractor pulls and these big
[1:07:08] engines and all of these oh my just roar
[1:07:12] just the power and God wants this church
[1:07:15] full of
[1:07:16] power and you don't
[1:07:18] realize real power is overcoming
[1:07:23] self even but Braham says if you could
[1:07:25] can if you can conquer yourself you got
[1:07:28] more power than demanded runs all over
[1:07:29] the building screams the loudest and
[1:07:31] does all of those things real power is
[1:07:34] being able to submit yourself control
[1:07:37] your thoughts throw out Doubt cast out
[1:07:42] Doubt cast out doubt and let Faith come
[1:07:45] in let love come in let confidence come
[1:07:48] in let peace come in ain't that right so
[1:07:52] I'm telling you the hardest battle
[1:07:57] amen
[1:07:59] is
[1:08:01] overcoming yourself and the thoughts
[1:08:04] that come into your mind overcoming
[1:08:09] fear I would not be standing here like
[1:08:12] this at
[1:08:15] all if it wouldn't have been for
[1:08:17] overcoming power of the Holy Ghost hello
[1:08:20] I wouldn't be preaching like this if I
[1:08:22] let fear and despair overcome
[1:08:27] amen when you go down that road and I'll
[1:08:29] give you one little thought that come to
[1:08:32] my mind that I want it to entertain and
[1:08:34] you know how brother baham said that
[1:08:36] when God calls a a
[1:08:39] a a man to Pastor or minister right he
[1:08:43] calls his wife also and in my despair or
[1:08:46] in my wrong thought I said well I wonder
[1:08:48] why he couldn't do that for when he
[1:08:49] takes one if he calls one take the other
[1:08:52] one
[1:08:53] too little thoughts like that go through
[1:08:56] your mind
[1:08:58] amen because of the love that you have
[1:09:03] amen sometimes God allows pain so
[1:09:08] much that I thought that if I took an 8
[1:09:11] inch knife found my rib cage went
[1:09:14] between them and jabbed it into there it
[1:09:17] would be less
[1:09:18] painful than some of the thoughts that
[1:09:21] come to your mind
[1:09:24] hello but what do we do we don't
[1:09:26] entertain those thoughts we cast those
[1:09:29] thoughts to the
[1:09:31] Wayside that's
[1:09:34] right so the biggest part of a trial is
[1:09:39] not the trial but it's overcoming the
[1:09:42] fear if they just think if Israel would
[1:09:45] have done that now this is where God
[1:09:48] this is oh this is where God dwells
[1:09:51] hello God dwells in that Faith but Bram
[1:09:55] says you know he can only heal you
[1:09:57] according to your faith so if you think
[1:09:59] the days of Miracles has passed well
[1:10:01] guess what you better rely on a doctor
[1:10:03] or you're
[1:10:04] dead that right cuz God can't honor that
[1:10:07] no they have nothing for God to
[1:10:10] honor you've got to believe that he
[1:10:12] is that is heward rewarder of those that
[1:10:15] diligently seek him that by his stripes
[1:10:17] he is that you are
[1:10:19] healed we believe that when you believe
[1:10:22] that with all of your
[1:10:24] heart and don't don't doubt the rest is
[1:10:26] up to God
[1:10:29] Amen take
[1:10:31] fear and go back to hell with it
[1:10:34] devil take depression and go back to
[1:10:37] hell with it that's right every one of
[1:10:40] us no doubt not just us but every one of
[1:10:43] us somehow or other the devil's
[1:10:44] attacking
[1:10:45] probably don't you don't how many
[1:10:47] realize is there the devil bring things
[1:10:49] about you way to try to drag you down to
[1:10:52] try to bring you into depressed States
[1:10:54] so when you come into the house of God
[1:10:56] we ain't got the shouting that we do
[1:10:58] anymore we ain't got the preaching that
[1:11:00] we used to do we ain't got the the the
[1:11:03] Hallelujah like we used to do the devil
[1:11:04] don't like this the devil don't like us
[1:11:07] worshiping God the way that we do he
[1:11:09] don't like it but guess what the more he
[1:11:12] don't like it the more we're going to
[1:11:14] [Applause]
[1:11:18] do I like what lne Lawson said man if
[1:11:21] you don't want to worship then get on
[1:11:23] out of here let me worship I'll do the
[1:11:25] worshiping if you don't want to you
[1:11:27] don't want to believe in shouting and
[1:11:29] praising God and having Liberty in the
[1:11:31] house of God go find the church that's
[1:11:33] dead there's some of them around no
[1:11:36] doubt but it ain't around
[1:11:39] here we have a living God we're living
[1:11:42] oracles living Epistles written and real
[1:11:45] of all men
[1:11:50] amen amen so I learned those two things
[1:11:54] with God it's not a about the trial we
[1:11:56] look at the trial oh my such a trial
[1:11:59] such a trial and it's the same thing as
[1:12:03] if you look at a
[1:12:05] symptom how many knows if you look at
[1:12:07] your
[1:12:09] symptom you won't never be
[1:12:12] healed if you listen to a doctor's
[1:12:15] report you'll never get
[1:12:17] well
[1:12:19] amen if we listen to Donna's doctor
[1:12:21] report you are going to die
[1:12:25] from
[1:12:26] that if you listen to
[1:12:29] that well he a going know you ain't
[1:12:31] going to get nowhere that's not God's
[1:12:34] report how many glad that there's
[1:12:36] another report over here and by his
[1:12:39] stripes we are healed that's God's
[1:12:42] report and I'm a whole lot more excited
[1:12:44] about that than I am with about the
[1:12:45] other
[1:12:48] report amen praise be to God same thing
[1:12:53] with the trial don't look at the trial
[1:12:54] don't look how bad it is don't look at
[1:12:56] how hard it is look at your attitude
[1:12:58] about it look at how you react to it
[1:13:01] that's what's God is looking
[1:13:04] for
[1:13:05] amen he's looking for how you will
[1:13:11] react
[1:13:13] amen all right God loves to bring people
[1:13:16] bring you in trouble he loves to put
[1:13:19] trouble down and see what you'll do
[1:13:21] about it so he just stopped up the Red
[1:13:23] Sea and the first thing you know

[1:13:28] place wouldn't have been well listen you
[1:13:31] see what it says

[1:13:50] if the Red Sea would have already been

[1:23:35] scriptures what I say when I say that
[1:23:38] it's not about the trial but it's about
[1:23:40] your reaction to the trial how many
[1:23:43] believes that after tonight I believe
[1:23:45] it's not so much about the trial that
[1:23:46] trial is God wanting to see your
[1:23:49] reaction see if you'll have faith or
[1:23:52] whether you'll have doubt amen and
[1:23:55] believe me how many knows brother Glen
[1:23:58] you let doubt rule there's a whole lot

[1:24:05] of
[1:24:06] junk amen like brother Braham says
[1:24:08] there's absolutely nothing good about
[1:24:11] fear nothing good about it at all can't
[1:24:14] do anything for you it'll only make
[1:24:17] things
[1:24:18] work I'm going to take job for an
[1:24:20] illustration here for a
[1:24:23] minute the the Lord said to Satan hast
[1:24:25] thou considered my servant job that
[1:24:27] there is none like him in the earth it
[1:24:28] perfect than an upright man one that
[1:24:30] fearth God and ath Evil and still he
[1:24:33] holdeth fast his in well this was the
[1:24:34] second time still he holdeth fast his
[1:24:37] Integrity although thou removed us me
[1:24:40] against to destroy him without a
[1:24:42] cause then Satan answered the Lord and
[1:24:46] said skin for skin yeah all that a man
[1:24:48] have will he give for his life but put
[1:24:50] thou forth thine hand now and touch his
[1:24:53] bone and his flesh
[1:24:55] in other words let this come upon him
[1:24:58] and this will be his reaction he will
[1:25:01] curse you to your face Satan says you're
[1:25:04] going to have a reaction that he's going
[1:25:06] to curse you if you touch his flesh it
[1:25:09] was the same story am me before he lost
[1:25:11] all of his children and everything he'll
[1:25:13] curse you to the face both times
[1:25:17] amen why it was God looking for the
[1:25:21] reaction the devil thought he would get
[1:25:23] the a negative reaction action from
[1:25:25] him oh that's what the devil
[1:25:31] wants this just comes to mind so I'll
[1:25:34] say
[1:25:34] it in times of Trials and Times of
[1:25:41] testings it is an wide openen door for
[1:25:45] evil things to come
[1:25:51] in let a husband and a wife have a
[1:25:55] spat let them get angry with each other
[1:25:59] let that and your love turns better bam
[1:26:02] says sometimes that natural love will
[1:26:03] turn into hate you'll
[1:26:06] hate they'll they can end up in
[1:26:10] divorce hello end up in divorce because
[1:26:13] of something that comes along because
[1:26:15] they don't have control of their
[1:26:18] reaction
[1:26:20] amen didn't mean to go down here but I
[1:26:22] will remember brother Bram says that one
[1:26:23] Pentecostal come and he says man I got
[1:26:25] saved and I've been casting that devil
[1:26:27] off of my wife casting that devil off of
[1:26:29] My Wife and everything she was about
[1:26:30] ready for a divorce brother Brandon what
[1:26:33] would I do what shall I do well he
[1:26:35] didn't have the right reaction didn't he
[1:26:37] no he say take this action go buy our
[1:26:39] flowers and stuff be nice to are kind
[1:26:42] later he come back man it revolutionized
[1:26:45] we're doing great now why because of his
[1:26:49] reaction
[1:26:51] amen and so many times evil things come
[1:26:55] come in
[1:26:57] families families are broke up
[1:26:59] friendships are broke up is that right
[1:27:02] bitterness between people for years and
[1:27:04] years and decades why because people
[1:27:07] have the wrong reaction to what's going
[1:27:12] on how many believes it's important that
[1:27:14] you have the right reaction to whatever
[1:27:16] little thing comes your way this is not
[1:27:17] just for big things but this is for the
[1:27:19] little things that come your way
[1:27:21] somebody does you wrong you better watch
[1:27:23] your
[1:27:24] reaction cuz bitterness will come in and
[1:27:27] when bitterness come in hatred comes in
[1:27:29] that's exactly what Cain did he got
[1:27:32] jealous just jealousy came in then
[1:27:34] hatred then
[1:27:36] murder evil things come of these places
[1:27:39] and these doors that come
