david lead song service brought back a lot of old memories of about 32 years ago and i pastored myself in arkansas brother david was the song leader there and god's brought us a long ways hadn't he but he's brought us the right way amen so we appreciate the lord this morning as you're standing we'd like to open our bibles to the book of beginnings the book of genesis just wants to say it's been wonderful to be here and these services with you i want to thank again brother our brother brother thomas byler for allowing us to come and just minister to this portion of the bride of christ thank you young people for listening so tentatively and the middle-aged folk we appreciate you and the age folk as well i don't say old people just age people amen we certainly appreciate them being in the meetings as well you know i was reminded when i was 22 years old i think it was i had my oldest sons luke and elijah they're 30 today but they were about 2 years old i remember my brother by the name of daniel williams i remember his brother daniel williams i was sitting in his office one day at his home and i think my boys were about two or three years old and brother daniel called me into his office and i he said something to me that day that stuck with me even to this day brother daniel's gone on but he said the statement to me he said brother luke this is his statement he said don't ever do what i did don't make the mistake that i made in my heart i was thinking brother daniel what in the world are you talking about and this is what he said to me and it stuck with me he said don't you travel around the world and try to win the world and lose your own family and when he said that it penetrated my heart and i was determined that if i did travel and i have around the world but i was not going to do it at the expense of my own family and i thank god today that after these years every one of my children seven of them are all serving the lord and i certainly appreciate god for that if he never done another thing for me saving my family and all of them being in christ is the greatest gift that god could ever give to me as a human being and i certainly appreciate him for that i said it and i know it's hard words but i'd rather go to hell than to see my children lost i'd rather take their place i know that's tough but i mean that i'd rather be lost and then be saved but i just thank god he made room for us all amen and god is good to us amen i know your pastor mentioned it but september the 22nd through the 25th twice a year i set up my gospel tent and there in townville right next to our church we have a property there and i set it up we have wonderful meetings and this year brother bottler and brother jason jackson will be coming and ministering two services of peace the 22nd through the 25th and if you're able to come you're all certainly welcome to come we'll treat you so good so many ways you're bound to like one of them and so we do sort of what you do here we have our meetings in every night we have fellowship over in our fellowship hall and just we just have a good time amen so everyone here would certainly be welcome to come we if you all can't come that's fine but just make sure he comes that's that's the main thing amen genesis chapter one how many's enjoyed the services so far and i've tried not to last night i apologize i went a little longer than what i um was meant to and brother david let me know that i went longer than what i was supposed to so he changed a bit amen genesis chapter one i'd like to read two verses verses 26 and 27. very familiar text to all of us we all know how the prophet god explained all of this in question answered in genesis but i just want to read it for a foundation and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image and in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and brother branham question answers would take you from there take you to john 4 24 and tell you that god is a spirit so when he made the first man who was the son of god an attribute off of god if god would have a son he would be a spirit son right he would be a spirit son just like brother batman talked about the three dispensations when the son of man when the holy ghost come on the day of pentecost he called it son of god because it was it was sonship in spirit form that's what adam was in the garden of eden adam was called the son of god now we turn over to genesis chapter 2 one verse we find in genesis chapter 2 that god created man but yet he said there's no man to toil the ground in other words he didn't have a body yet so in genesis chapter 2 the lord god formed the man of the dust of the ground and god breathed into his nostrils the breath of life here it is and man became everybody say with me a living soul so now we have a three-part being we have a man who is spirit in the image of god he now has a body he's taken on flesh god breathes into him and becomes a living soul body spirit and soul now turn with me one other place romans chapter 12 verse 1 and verse 2. romans chapter 12 1-2 again another familiar scripture to his romans 12 1 and 2. paul i beseech the word there means to beg you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies as a living say with me a living say it again a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god i'd like to take my thought this morning from verse two if i could let me verse one i'm sorry let me read it again i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies say with me as a i would like to speak this morning just along those lines for a few minutes on being a living sacrifice that is what our spiritual worship is is to be a living sacrifice i trust the holy spirit will speak to our hearts father we thank you for your word we pray now lord at this final closing service oh god that is it's another service now lord and we just pray that the holy spirit would have his way over these next few moments may you take this lord and just cap it off into the heart of the people may the holy spirit just come now and take preeminence lord and help me but once again just to get out of the way and lord give your people ears to hear lord a mind to conceive and a heart to receive this morning and then father when we walk out of here may we have a greater reality that we are not our bodies we are in our body and our bodies are just vehicles that pack us around but lord in us is you and in you lord you want to use our bodies to express yourself may we give it over to you this morning lord may we give our bodies as a living sacrifice as an expression that our soul has already been ignited lord and had already been changed into your image may the holy spirit have the preeminence in this service and we'll give you in the name of our lord jesus christ and the whole church says amen god bless you you may be seated this morning you know we hear a lot that and i'm sure there's nothing wrong with it i believe it that's right but i sure we'd all say that and i i'm certainly in agreement with that but i would like to just change the way you think for just a minute because the bible teaches us that we are changed or transformed that word is like the word uh meta it's metamorpho but it's to the word we get called metamorphosis it means to actually change forms and he said we change our forms by the renewing of our minds so we think a certain way sometimes and then the holy spirit will just bring inspiration change the way we think well i'd like to just change a little bit this morning a different direction and help you to look at something that sometimes it's not more of god that we need [Music] no it's that we need to give ourselves more to god so i'd like to sort of change your thought pattern just for it because um sometimes we got god we do we have god if you have the baptism the holy spirit this morning you have god we want more and more of him but i don't want more of him without equally giving myself more to him so i see as i give myself more to god he can use me more and then the counteract that is that will bring more god into me so i want to begin this morning and i trust that god will help us but i want to read a little quote to you we sung this morning wonderful songs we call this worship when the preaching is done we'll call it worship let's all worship together want to change your thinking there too just for a minute because we identify worship when we sing songs we identify worship when we have our hands up we identify worship when we're sitting in the church but i want to tell you this morning that worship can be worshiped when you're not singing worship can be worshipped when you're not having your hands up worship can be worshipped when you're not sitting in the house of god let me tell you what i based that upon brother branham said oh may god drive that home in this tabernacle this morning i pray that the holy spirit will sink that so deep into the hearts we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that we heard what type of people ought we to be when we see the great jehovah come down and do things that he does and see them compared scripture by scripture that they're the truth we sit around sometimes like works on log and so just so unconcerned we ought to be busy every minute trying to get people to christ we ought to be lively stones we should never be thoughtful like we are we'll go to church and see the lord jesus do something or bless in such a way and then we'll go out back and say that was a very nice meeting now the preaching of the word we enjoy it but that's not the main thing that's not we should not worship the lord just after we get through preaching the word as we usually do just worship him that's wonderful but we should worship him every hour of our life when we're at work we should worship him every time the opportunity presents itself worship the lord by testifying of him if you see some of you ladies see a woman in the wrong worship the lord by taking her and saying sister there's a better life than this a few minute work you hear a man using the name of the lord in vain get a chance pull him to one side slip over and take him by the hand say there's a better life than this you shouldn't use those words and tell him in a meek gentle way all those things is worship and when we see someone sick and the doctor said there's no more that can be done we ought to worship the lord by telling them there's a god in heaven that answers prayers now jesus when he was here he as i said the other night in john 4 he passed told the disciples y'all go on i have needs to go by samaria jesus went by sumerians sat on a well and a woman come out to draw water in the conversation that jesus had with her he ultimately said these words the hours come and now is that the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and the truth for the father seeketh such to worship him now jesus was not talking about her getting a guitar and a piano and all those things and i'm nothing wrong with that i believe in those things matter of fact i'm sold out on those things i like it but he said god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth worship is not just our singing not just our praising not just in our music when we walk out of these doors and we go out into our everyday life we're still worshiping the lord we worship him everywhere we go as i said back home we have on sunday morning i look like you all do the same thing so i don't feel so bad people ask me how many folk you got going to church i said which service sunday morning we have about 175 maybe 150 sunday night not half that cloud sunday night wednesday night a little bit less that's just the way it is it's way and as i travel around i realize that's the way it is everywhere but i but we we come to church and we worship and here's what i say on sunday morning when i preach a cir one sermon and i said you folks leave this church there should be 150 sermons preached on monday i preach one here and you take 150 out there because each one of you ought to become a living sermon you ought to go out here and express christ to the world as i said last night everybody should preach the gospel and of necessary used words our life should be an expression of christ now when we think of worship it's hard to not think of worship and think of some sort of a spiritual house a temple a church and and and we we have to kind of train our minds not to look at this building as what god's coming after this is we call this the house of lord but it's wood and it's stubble and it's it may be concrete and carpet and all these things but when the rapture comes he ain't coming after this building he's coming after this building your bodies is the temple of the holy ghost brother it would be sad thing if we thought the only time we met god is when we come to church we bring god with us when we come to church when we leave we take god with us he's in each one of our hearts this morning by the baptism of the holy ghost and as the body of christ we are the church are you with me so far here's what the bible says and he also has lively stones i like that lively stone not dead stones lively stones i tell people all the time if you can punctuate the word god with an amen say amen if you're going to nod to me don't just do it easy give me a good hearty knob let me know there's somebody there we ought to be lively stones not a dead church a live church we have a living god among us not a dead god he's a living god brother david said you go to a bald game it's the truth brother david i've been to him that boy right there zechariah one day we took him to i think he might have been six flat you know we didn't tell it but it might have been six flags over georgia or you know north carolina whatever that place is up there one of these places where about every ride is tempting the lord thy god and he said daddy come ride this with me you probably don't even remember it come ride this ride with me was it him mom or was it jeremiah was him wasn't it zechariah i believe but he said ride it it was one of these rides that they go up real slow and they click click click click click click i said son i'm not riding it i said i rode that when i was young but i'm older now and you know my heart i just don't like that kind of stuff i believe it tempts the lord thy god the bible said him only shalt thou serve oh come on daddy so i decided to get on the ride with him and click click click click took about 10 or 15 seconds to get off the top then we got close to the top he said lift your hands up and so i lifted my hands up i'm used to doing that in church but not on the rise so i lifted my hands up when he got to the side it boom it dropped my heart dropped he screamed i screamed then with the crazy thing is we got out the same spot that we started at and i got off that rod and i said now wait a second boy if we can get on a ride lift our hands and scream on a ride that takes us back where we started from and you can do that on this kind of ride and next time we're in church you ought to have your hands up praising the lord because we're on a ride that's going to take us somewhere where we started at we come from god we're going back to god and if you can stream on something like that how much more in the house of god can we praise him and love him [Applause] he played in a a state championship last year and i've got the picture and i'll always have it and in the picture they put him in the newspaper and he's just like maybe he caught that game is what he did and after the game they won and he was so excited he jumped so high off the ground and he's got his leg out in his hand like that and it's on a paper in the newspaper the local paper and i got a copy of it matter of fact it's in my phone and i thought if you can be happy about winning the game to bring you that high off the ground how much more a soul it saved that's got the holy ghost that's been redeemed from sin come on church we ought to be able to love him and worship him for his great grace that he's poured out not only upon our lives but on our lives of others amen we have a right to worship him we have a right to praise him we should be a lively living stone and each stone makes up this spiritual house until peter said we'll notice these words we're a holy offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable this is powerful to god by jesus christ and i'm going to get in a little something here and i'll try not to hold you too long but what we see is if there is a worship then there is a temple and if there is a temple then there are sacrifices if there's sacrifices being offered there is priests that offer them and then there's a priesthood but this priesthood is not after the aaron aaronic priesthood or the levitical priesthood as a matter of fact when jesus come he was not even a high priest after the order of aaron he was a high priest after the order of melchizedek that priesthood has an end but jesus's was the one that was had no end it was after the power of an endless life and if you're sitting here this morning you don't have a life that's going to end you have eternal life and the reason it won't end because it never did begin it's without beginning and it's without end let me tell you why i'm laying this just for a second hebrews 13 verse 15 tells us that by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise you realize you come to church sometimes and you don't feel like praise but i don't serve god because i feel like it i do it because he's worthy of it there's times and i'm the preacher that i thought got up and said oh my god to go to church my body feels that way but then there's something inside down in that soul says but i'm going to church today sometimes you might look look in this meeting that we've had friday saturday this morning you might wake up this morning and don't even feel like you're saved but you ain't saved because you feel it you're saying because you believe it if we just went by feelings our life would be a roller coaster we don't go by our feelings we go by his word this is a faith law okay man so sometimes i come in and i might not like feel like lifting up my head but my soul says lift them up anyways amen because this is a sacrifice of praise but i'm going to get to something then he went on to say praise god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but now when i come to romans 12 he tells us to offer to god a living sacrifice but then when he brings it down he says offering yourself to god is the liberal side it's just a reasonable service it's just a reasonable service here's the facts the concept of a sacrifice is certainly old testament yes the first man that ever fell in the garden of eden he didn't make the first sacrifice adam didn't make the first sacrifice eve didn't make the first sacrifice even abel didn't make the first sacrifice the first sacrifice that was ever made was made by god himself he killed a lamb and clothed the fallen man and his wife adam and eve and he clothed them in the skins that they were covered in god made the first sacrament but notice the sacrifice that was made when it was made it had to be offered as a dead sacrifice because no sacrifice in the old testament was ever offered to god except you took the life of that sacrifice so every offering that was ever offered to god was a dead sacrifice and that dead sacrifice represented someone who was living but when paul picks up the sacrifice in romans 12 he doesn't speak of a dead sacrifice he speaks of a living sacrifice let me show you why this is important sacrifice is not us offering and i'm going to show you why we don't offer animals today god don't want an animal he don't want one of your lambs he doesn't want a bull he doesn't want a turtledove he doesn't want a goat god don't want any animals matter of fact he never had pleasure in those things no god wants a sacrifice but he doesn't want a dead animal no i don't want you bringing a substitute for you he wants you to bring you and when you bring you he doesn't want you coming for offering something that represents you he wants you and when he when you when you come he doesn't want to come and bring him something dead he wants to bring him something that is living a living sacrifice now just stay with me for a minute the language of sacrifices is certainly old testament it's ceremonial it's the language of the levitical priesthood it's the language of sacrifice the levitical system the language of priesthood and in the old testament they would offer to god a lamb a turtle dove they would bring the sacrifice notice this to the holy place of which brother byler the people that brought their sacrifice had to depend on somebody else to go in there for them so nobody that brought a sacrifice could actually go into the holy place they'd have to bring the sacrifice and then before it would enter in they would kill it and then that individual would take that [Music] representation of the blood and go into the holy place and that animal would represent the person but the person themselves could never enter into the holy place the only thing they could actually give to god which watch this would represent the condition of their own soul because man was separated from god he was in a dead condition we all came in the world ephesians 2 i read the other night dead and trespasses and sin there was no response there was nothing in our human makeup even in our fallen condition that we could ever give to god that would please him so the only thing that man could do was bring dead sacrifices which brother ben tells us was simply what it was a substitute as a matter of fact that dead animal as brother ben would say was a lower life form than man because it was a it was had a spirit but it was an animal and it and man was made hard because he had a soul and the animal had no soul so brother said when you offered it the life of the animal could not come back upon the worshiper that was bringing the dead sacrifice so he would walk away with the very same nature desires that he had before he went so there was no change about him the only thing was a dead sacrifice was offered and this man's sins that he may have confessed he placed his hand on the head of that animal those sins were not even remitted they were only covered because the power of animal blood had no power to wipe out the memory of god what man had committed that's why the bible tells you in hebrews 10 that the same sacrifices the high priest stands daily offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sin and then this is what it says and when the high priest or the priest offered the sacrifice there was a remembrance of sins made every year think about that hear people young poor and the feast was coming and they would go to offer the sacrifice and when that animal was shed and his blood was poured out and that worshiper walked away the only thing that that little ceremony did and that substitute did was remind god of what man did in the beginning because every time they offered an animal they were replicating what god did in the garden when he sacrificed an animal and reminded god of the sin that man had committed listen to me that's what dead sacrifices does because that animal blood had no power to wipe out of god's mind the sins that was committed by the human race now i'm going to give you the answer here and then we're going to preach it but did you know when jesus come the bible said but this man offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of god and listened to this and then the bible said after he did that then god said their sins and iniquities will i remember no more amen the blood of jesus christ which was the created brother jehovah god didn't remind god of what we did it wiped out his memory wiped out of his mind every sin that was ever committed past present and future the power of jehovah's created blood was the only thing that had power to wipe out god's memory that he would take man sin cast him into a sea never to be remembered again brother if that don't make you happy i don't know what will but them high priest if you read it the bible said they stood daily standeth daily standeth daily offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sin them priests work the reason the bible tells you they stood daily is because it was a sign the work would never be completed their work would never be finished that's why a man stands because his work isn't completed but that you notice when jesus offered his sacrifice and then he ascended to god the first thing the bible said was he set down when this high priest offered the sacrifice he went to throw him with god the holiest of all and sat down because there was a sign the work was finished and let me just tell you this then priest back there would die and another priest would take his place then he would die another priest would take his praise he would die and another preacher would take his place but when our high priest and our apostle when in the presence of god he lives forever more he could never die again nobody will ever take the place of jesus nobody will ever substitute him amen he's god's amen every living memorial in the present of god and he stands there to represent you enough this morning in the presence of god not a dead sacrifice he lives oh really god i'm saying like the bible he ever lives to make intercession upon the confession of the saints you're still with me let me go on so here they would bring the sacrifice sacrifice was basically a substitute the system of offering dead animals has ended yes that system of offering something dead to god he takes this is the bible he had no pleasure in those things he didn't god wasn't pleased with animal sacrifice you study history you'll find millions and millions and millions and millions of gallons of animal blood was shed and not even a speck an ounce of that animal blood had any power to remit our sins and make us sinless in the presence of god that's right there's no more animal sacrifices none of that is pleasing to god why because it's dead and the bible said jesus in that he died why did he die he didn't die because he sinned he died because the sins of you and i came on him so he had to represent us in that dead condition but said in there he died he died once to sin and that he liveth he liveth unto god and tonight jesus is just as alive as he ever was he will never die again i'm just going to put the points in here and if you're in him you'll never die again if you're a christian you cannot die brother said matter of fact christians don't die they only change their dwelling places you take my body you led out to the grave that ain't me that's what we'll get to that's not me that's just the body that's just the vehicle i walk around in you can't even see me i'm down on the inside of this body don't get so in love with this hey this is going to be i'm going to step out of this one day if i leave here before jesus comes or you do you're going to step out of this step over into another body that's already waiting on you how long has that body been around well here's what the bible said we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal eternal don't you think you just started when you got here you were somewhere else before you ever got here you just bypassed that and came here through a sexual act the brother had there not ever been a fall every predestinated seated god who's named the lamb's book of life would have come right to that garden by the spoken word of god but then the fall happened and man came in the world a secondary way which was by sexual act but when jesus come he bypassed the sexual act and came in the world with a spoken word of god and you know what he did he was making a way for us to be born again not by such a desire but by the holy ghost amen he was making way for the new birth and do you realize in the resurrection brother madam said in paragraph 45 page 45 and merging divorce he said god will call his children from the dust of the earth like he did at the beginning amen not by sexual desire but by the power of the spoken word the cosmic lights have petroleum he'll call you up and you'll come out of that grave not a different body but the same body but in a glorified condition oh i hope you believe that that's our hope this morning but now watch this very closely what does god want now well he wants living not dead he wants living sacrifices now when i was a young pentecostal boy i was just thinking back there again brother daryl and brother david i was about 20 years old when i started pastoring arkansas when these guys met me i still didn't believe in brother thomas wearing short sleeves i would not put a pair of short sleeves on my holy arms we didn't believe in that we only wore long sleeves we didn't wear rings and watches all that ungodly stuff we didn't wear that stuff we just didn't do it we didn't wear watches i know that's all man-made traditions i get it that's all man nature but you know what we believe we believe that we were offering things of god that was pleasing him and somehow i could offer something to make myself more acceptable to god thank god for this message thank god for a vindicated prophet that knows how to balance us up and bring us back in line with the word of god thank god for the ability to die to the old system say man and let god change our mind to mold us into the image of his word but god wanted what not something weak at all this is very important because you young people are going to understand you don't have nothing to bring to god to make yourself acceptable to him but something's got to die something has to die the only thing that you could ever offer to god that would make yourself you can't even approach him without it there's only one thing that had a power to deal with your sin and that is christ it's so true that you don't even have the power to approach god except to go through christ okay what all these religions tell you muslims and hindus and i've been in their countries and i've been to india where they got over 40 000 gods i've been on an airplane in india flying from one side of any to the other and a cockroach is crawling on the wall of the plane and i tell the interpreter next to me i said if that thing comes near me my hand to god i'll kill it oh no you can't do that it would upset this whole plane really yeah because that could be uncle sword and so come back as a cockroach i said well he's gonna die again he comes near me he's dead and i went down the restaurant and the hypocrisy that's in it cows are walking down the streets people are skinny and the cows are all fat and they worship the cows and when i when they saw the cow they saw uncle tony when i saw the cow i saw a rib eye steak and i said man i'm tired of this rice i'm tired this stuff i said you found your restaurant served me a steak and they found me one and we went down there and they did it just for the americans and you think of the hot pockets why are you going to feed me your family if you believe that you're better why are you going to feed it to me i sat there and ate that big rib eye and told the interpreter with me i said their incest their ancestors taste really good right now can you imagine having that type of mentality but i've seen it you know where they believe that they can approach god but listen here's the facts in our condition we cannot even approach a holy god no religion has rights to approach god without a mediator between them and that god he's holy and we ain't there's one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus jesus said i am the way i am the truth and i am the life and no man comes to the father but by me now why is that so wonderful let me tell you why because that means as the song says nothing in my arms i bring simply to the cross i clean if i'm going to come to god and something has to die in my place then what i'm going to accept is i'm going to come to a holy god with a sacrifice but the sacrifice motor says that i'm bringing to him is not a dead sacrifice it's a living sacrifice the sacrifice i'm approaching god with is not myself it's jesus you say well what about me well the only way you can become a living sacrifice is to get in jesus if you're in christ today you're not a dead sacrifice how can i get in christ well the bible teaches it first corinthians chapter 12 verse 13 tells us that by one spirit we're all baptized into one body and when you get in that body this body is a living body it's a holy body and the only way you can ever be a living sacrifice is you got to be in a living christ i don't mean a church i mean christ i don't mean a building i mean christ there's all kinds of people sitting in church of the day they're not in christ i passed quite a few of them coming down the road and it's possible some of you could be sitting here this morning that's not incredible not saying you're eight but it's possible being said in a message because with a message building don't mean you're in christ we made a horrible mistake by teaching that nonsense well if you believe our doctrine i don't care you know every doctrine brother and preach that still don't mean you're in christ you've got to meet the person of christ brother adam wasn't coming here to try just to change our theology he was trying to introduce us to a living christ [Applause] listen i'm gonna say just a couple of things i gotta hurry young ladies it's wonderful that you've never put a pair of scissors to your hair that is wonderful that you've never done that but you ain't seen because you've never cut your hair it's wonderful you don't walk around in short short skirts showing your thighs off to men but you ain't saved because you've got dresses dragging the ground [Music] i'm trying to hurt your feelings i'm just telling the fact boys you ain't saying because you don't smoke cigarettes and tell dirty jokes that's wonderful you might not do that morally but you still ain't saved because you do those things or don't do those things i was sitting down in a barber chair a few years back and i don't usually let men cut my hair because most of them are they're too sweet to be messing with me and so i've never used a male stylist or a barber because i don't like them i don't like the way they act they don't act like a man i don't want to touch me if i have a woman give me a real one [Applause] i sit in a restaurant one day and this boy come up can i help you i said no you can't i said go back to the back send a real woman the manager come out said well you're not satisfied with your server i said no you sent me a counterfeit send me the real thing she looked at me what do you mean i said send me a real woman they sent shim somewhere else and sent me a her a she that's right waited on me i'm sitting in that some of you i don't like that boy i hit that stuff had a fella one time tried to pay me five thousand dollars quit preaching against homosexuality i said the man would have the guts to tell me that i said then you you're either one or you got somebody in your family come to find out his son was one and he didn't want to hear me preaching against it i don't care if your grandma's one of them we're still going to preach the truth it's an abomination inside of god amen and we got a society trying to dumb us down so we don't speak out against those things but this bible causing an abomination of god expects you girls to act like cinnamon act like girl new boys masculine be boys be men so i sit there in that barber chair and one thing i don't do is talk about religion the bible god or nothing else while i'm sitting in a barber chair that's a dumb mistake they'll accidentally shade the back of your head up you say something they disagree with and she asked me a question she said can i ask you something i said yes she said your wife doesn't cut her hair and i said look i don't talk bible while you're cutting my hair when you're done cutting my hair i'll talk bible with you she said oh i won't do nothing and i said okay i said if you mess me up i'll never come back again oh i wouldn't do that to you she said but am i going to hell because i cut my hair i said absolutely not shocked her she said well wait a second you had a fella here the other day that told me you was his pastor and she named the fella and i said yeah he does go to church with me he told me i was going to hell because i cut my hair i said he lied to you she said but you're his pastor don't y'all believe the same thing and i said well not that she said well don't you believe i ought to cut my hair i said no my wife doesn't cut her hair i said but she's not going to heaven because she don't cut her hair and you're not going to hell because you cut yours she was taken back she didn't understand it because i don't get it i said well let me ask you something if you knew the bible told you not to cut your hair and it was given to you for your glory and you've done it anyways are you going to hell because you cut your hair or are you going to hell because you disbelieve what god said she said now that makes sense i said ain't nobody going to hell because they cut their hair and smokes and they're on down the line i said you go to hell because you disbelieve and i said when you're saved you ain't saved because you grow long hair and do this and do that and do this you say cause you believe all the other things are attributes of either faith or unbelief she said that makes perfect sense so her hair as i kept going back her hair kept getting longer and longer look it was nice it looked nice to see it on her and then finally one day i went in and it was chopped back off again i said hey well she was i just couldn't do it it's getting too long and i said look that's because you don't have to do it on the inside that's now we got to get to the other thing when you believe and it's true faith then god will confirm your faith by giving you the holy ghost then when you get the holy ghost now you got to want to down inside there and you you wouldn't have done it because i told you to the bible to which is good nothing wrong with that but you do it now not because it's a rule or it's a ritual or it's a regulation you do it because of the love of god in your heart that wants to serve him and you become a living sacrifice to him i know that's old-fashioned but it's right we put so much emphasis out here look you're trying to clean the fist before you catch it [Music] then we get our cart before the horse that's right and what we got to do is get men and women of christ you get into christ and the life of christ will come on the inside and when the life is down the inside in that root down on the inside the inside then you won't have to go around worrying about the fruit they'll automatically manifest themselves this ain't counterfeit this ain't manufacturing this a hypocrisy this ain't putting on it could come out of a genuine burst from the holy ghost god wants living sacrifices listen now here's brother banham can i have a few more minutes this morning y'all look quiet on me now when you do that scares me thinks maybe i got a rabbit on the run back home when they do that i start just chasing the rabbit and i'll chase it all around the church until it comes right back where we started from but we have to deal with it i don't want that young man that's my son but i do not want him believing that he's going to heaven because his daddy's a preacher i do not want him ever believing because he was raised in church that's a ticket to heaven i want him knowing he's met christ you think these kids understand as much as brother byler nope the man studies day in and day out they'll probably never have the understanding maybe their pastor well well you can't the prophet of god said it can't grow no higher than your pastor god will take that gift and keep elevating him in the word keep bringing you up and bringing you up it's a gift that's put there or brother bran or any of these other brothers that's called a god to preach god puts that gift in them and that gift to open up the word so they can open it up to you so that's god's channel but i don't want him depending on knowledge i want him to know christ then if he knows christ and the holy spirit get on the inside and just lead and guide him on altar and guess what we all don't grow at the same pace that's what i said the other night this bible right here never ever ever ever puts a magnifying glass in your hand the only thing this bible does is put a mirror in your hand any young girl's got a mirror you got a mirror i figured you got it on you is it here any of you women got a mirror in the church do you lord god really nope no woman's got a mirror to check her face out before she goes into church how about you boys this bible is a mirror and when you look into the mirror of his word it don't show you everybody else it shows to yourself it's not a magnifying glass where you're looking checking everybody else out brother you had one oh you just stay right here then who you see me that's right hey don't get mad at that miracle that looks like what it looks like that's just you man you can be seated thank you who you see that's right who you see so you don't see me you only see yourself that's what this bible is every time you look into it you see yourself you don't see everybody else it's not a magnifying glass that i go around checking you out and seeing if your skirt is exactly right or let me check them heels out see if they're right there flat as they can get you're all right [Laughter] even though we know the prophet preached that what the man of god does is just obey the holy spirit preach what god's put on his heart and let the holy spirit work on people let god look at their god you say well i'm gonna check what you can change them but that don't mean they're gonna stay changed you know i saved a lot of people i did i've saved people and guess where they're at tonight this morning back out in the world when we save them they'll go back out when he saves them he seals them in the christ well i convinced so-and-so to believe the message don't worry somebody's smarter than you somebody come along and talk them out of it you talk them in they'll talk them out god reveals it to you nobody's talked you in nobody will talk you out god revealed it to you but holy ghost this word is a mirror where we look in and we ask god to change us verse corinthians you can read it sometimes 13. let me give this to you brother bam says now everybody can't be a preacher but you've got a voice this what's he unfolds this now if you can't preach the people sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but you live the people of sermon look i'm not going to be really too harsh but this spirit that's floating around our message and i'm a hey i've been like the other day i was in jeffersonville and i went into little gym to work out and there was two ladies in there and i walked up and i said uh ladies i said y'all go to church around here she said we go to branham tabernacle i said wonderful i said do you all know a fellow by the name of billy paul branham well sure i said do you know his daddy william branham why yes i said wonderful i said i've been preaching his message for about 30 years because i thought you look familiar what's your name i said luke gibson i passed her down oh yes yes she goes well i just want you to know that i'm a tape girl all the way i said praise god i've been listening to tapes for 30 years and i still preach the gospel so y'all have a wonderful day the fightful ministry is not stop pause stop play pause fast forward rewind it's apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers i'll show you where god put them in you showed me where god ever took them out now all of you cannot be in the five-fold ministry we call it the five-fold ministry we don't get offended it just simply means five offices that's in the body that ministry that god uses all of you can't be that and you that's not don't ever try it we got a mess by people invading the pulpits without a call of god businessman look how wealthy you are you ain't got no rights to hand the word and get in the pool because you got money money is not the qualification or wealth is not the quality to be called to preach matter of fact peter said silver and gold have we none them them was pentecostal preachers no but you can preach how live your sermon let the sermon be lived it's the voice of god that'll bring reproach to them that reject it they say no one can put a finger on his or her life they're sweet there was a man of god it's that man or that woman see brother says live your sermons keep watching don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you get all mixed up anyhow messed up and you'll get people tangled up you know you'll ruin them and yourself too just live your sermon the preacher is called to preach his and live it too and if he can't live it then you stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermon now watch all right here was voices oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness and purity undefiled lives walking around on earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you holler the devil don't care how much you can jump up and how you can do this and do that or shout but what hurts the devil is to see a sanctified holy life consecrate to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as he can be move right on oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil you know what he's talking about he goes on to tell it and he's talking about living epistles known and read of all men there's people out here that will never pick up their bible but they will read their bible in you because you're a living sacrifice god takes you and writes with the finger hold god he writes up on the tables of a fleshy heart and you become god's word in manifestation you remember the apostles and that 120 when they went up in the upper room let me hurry they went out of that upper room they went up her brother and said cowards peter went up there and just a few days prior he denied our lord some months before that he pulled a sword out to take a man's ear off others said call down thunder lightning from heaven and kill them but when they went in that upper room they waited on the holy ghost and that killer of fire broke itself up and come in there like a russian mighty wind set up on that to one of them and they were all filled up holy ghost the prophet said out the doors and they went windows they went acting like a bunch of drunks you say oh we know they got it they were drunk we know they got it they shot it we know they got it they were speaking in other languages wait a second what was the real evidence that they had it i'll tell you what it was peter stood up when they said these men are drunk he said they are not drunk as you suppose but this is that the real evidence was they was unable to identify what scriptures was being interpreted for that hour and you know what he wasn't just quoting the scripture he didn't have to open the bible and say this look here it is here it is all he had to do was point out 120 and say this is that these people right here is joel's prophecy being interpreted they're they're god's prophecy this day in manifestation they may never wreck joel's prophecy but when they saw them people come out of that upper room stabbed him like a bunch of drunk people filled the holy ghost there was joel's prophecy in manifestation let me just say this there's people that'll never read my count 4 they won't read revelation 10 7 they won't read these scriptures but you realize sitting right here this morning it's a group of people that is malachi 4 you said no no brother madam's mother cat 4 5 i know that he's lied to the prophet but then it said but he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic father sitting right here is malachi 4 and 6 in human flesh brother and could say this day this scripture is fulfilled and he quotes malachi 4 but you and i can stand here today and say malachi 4 and 6. this day that scripture is being fulfilled god's word being interpreted in you not listen i'll just say like brother baby said not dead letter but a living sacrifice come on i'm talking about god living in you and you becoming a living sacrifice i miss it this way the word made flesh and dwelt among us acts 2 38 in flesh confessing repentance give you granted you repentance unto life brought down when you're confronted with the holy spirit conviction came and what happened god did sorrow work repentance not to be repented of the goodness of god the mercies of god does what leads man to repentance right then you're water baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ an act of obedience brother ben said when that candidate comes to the top of the water the holy ghost is there to meet it amen to fill it with the holy ghost let me tell what it is that's a sign that god has accepted your faith now let me go just a tad further for a minute because we're talking about living sacrifices it's essential it's essential in the old testament jews life was to present a presentation of a sacrifice as an indication of the genuineness of their faith the central act of the new covenant that means the new testament new covenant believer is a presentation not of an animal but of his heart his soul his mind and his body all that he is as a living sacrifice and what are the sacrifices of god here they come a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh god that will not despise my prayer be sent forth before he is an instant the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice christ died at calvary god poured upon him the justice of god man fell in the garden of eden justice went walking justice walked all the way until it met christ at calvary god poured the sins of the whole world him and the scripture said and it pleased the lord to bruise him and he made his soul an offering for sin that day at calvary god took full responsibility for every man and woman and if you die you die with christ when you when he raised we raise with him when he has sinned in the present god the probably god said we are sending with him he said we said now in heavenly places in christ jesus now he's there and we're here let me tie it together now they said the day that brother bradham baptized down on the ohio river sister branham where that time was his babysitter standing on the banks there in jeffersonville and when what transpired they left and brother branham had to ask her later did you see that light she said no bill no i didn't see it you told us to bow our heads so but did you hear the voice he said well sure bill i heard the voice but it was your voice now i know our mentality is or some voice thundered out there there wasn't some voice out there was that prophet that was saying speaking it out that's who they heard you know why because in heaven he's your voice but on earth you're his voice he represents you there and you represent him here [Applause] if god has a voice on earth today you're his voice if god's got eyes on earth today you're his eyes if he's got ears you're his ears brother said god walking around in you in two feet because you become a living that's what i keep driving home you become a lim young people take what you got this weekend you walk out in the world you go back to school you go to your college you go to your job you need to realize that if anybody's ever going to be christ to this world it's you you represent him as a living sacrifice and you're not trying to argue theology you're not trying to out debate everybody you're trying to portray christ as a living being a life the holy ghost you believe that say man redemption let me give this to you before i close absolutely great was the work of creation but greater is the work of redemption that's right it didn't cost god anything to create you but it cost him everything to redeem you the scripture said he created it with his finger but he redeemed you with his arm what happened man in the beginning as a spirit man brother bam said he led the animal life the way the holy spirit lives there today god and man had perfect fellowship right there then there was no man who told the ground god took the dust the earth and put had him in that body breathed man became a living soul god again had perfect fellowship with man man's trouble listen man's trouble was never in genesis 1. brother thomas the fall would have never happened if adam would stay in the form that he was in in genesis 1. the trouble come when he was put in flesh that's right then god took a rib from the side of not a spirit he took a rib from a man's body and made he a woman and brother bam said it was a byproduct off the original creation am i right took the phenomenal spirit put it in her and there stood in perfect fellowship had in his wife but the fall happened when they were in flesh what happened when the fall happened man separated himself from god all of a sudden god came down adam adam where are you god never had to ask that before brother said that light would come down into the garden they would hear a roar look over the tree and he said there would be a light around that tree he said they would hear roar that was jehovah talking to them said adam would take eve by the hand and they go over there by that tree and they'd have church in the evening time god and man and perfect fellowship then our bodies were made up to the animal life satan creeps in under the walls of the word in the garden of eden and vicariously through the serpent which is animal life which was what our bodies were made in the image of you go get it question answered exactly what he said and then the serpent came to the byproduct the woman and then she fell you know the story i'm gonna tell you why she fell she took sensation over revelation he introduced to her a new way to produce these names this is the way we'll do it and he introduced to her pleasure sensation through sensation she produced something that was not in the will of god that's right why do you think christ come because there came another woman 4 000 years ago that didn't take sensation she took revelation and said be it unto me according to our word and when she did by the creator like the god in her womb jesus came that's what should have happened in the garden of eden mary took since excuse me eve took sensation over revelation mary took revelation over sensation brother man said god never did give mary a sensation he took both egg and sperm and created himself a body god came down lifting the body now what happens this give me five minutes and i'll go what happened when man fell now brother bam i'm gonna tell you what he said all that adam lost jesus restored and this might be hard to swallow but right now i don't know how many people's in this building but when this service is over they ought to be a bunch of little jesus that walk out of here little christ little anointed ones individuals young people with god in them out of here and you go out there with an understanding that if god is going to express himself to the world it has to be through me i am his living not a dead i am his living sacrifice sacrifice already died to represent me that's jesus i'm identified with him and when i identify with him now the life of that sacrifice comes back on me it takes a dead man to make a living man out of him and i go out here as a living sacrifice representing the lord jesus christ my actions my life the way i live and what i talk what i do the way i handle my business the way i conduct myself in school and i don't cheat and i don't lie and i don't do all these things and that should be an expression that comes out of heart that's been regenerated but what happened well when adam fell being the abstract tied to the holder to the earth when he failed he lost the abstract title d it went back in the hands of original owner almighty god and the earth went into the hands of satan and brother of them said satan filthy hands could not take that book and went back to the hand of the owner and when it went back it sat there waiting on redemption claims now god was a spirit he had the book why didn't he redeem the book of spirit because it wasn't a spirit that lost the book it was a man that lost the book so it's got to be a man to redeem the book what happens in revelation 5 revelation 5 all of a sudden we see one settlement thrown in his hand was a book if he spirit wasn't he claiming because adam didn't lose in the spirit lawson as a man so we've been waiting on a man to come and redeem this book so god had to change his mass from spirit to become a man and he did it in the person of christ and all of a sudden john began to weep because there was no m-a-n man found worthy heaven earth under the earth and then one of the voices said john we not behold the line the tribe dude after villains and i turned and see a lot and i saw a lamb that had been bloody blood and blood had been slain but then said he come out from behind the throne what what's the drama what's the scene god changes math now god is a man here's a man that's conquered death held in the grave since black father he's the one that's got the right to take the book a man lost it so a man's got to redeem it and when he redeemed that book he redeemed every name in that book revelation 5 he redeemed the book but in revelation 10 he descended from heaven with an open book saying there's mysteries in that book yeah and you was in that book because your identity your name is identified with that mystery and today sitting right here look i'm just going to say it like it is when we are send back to meet jesus we ain't going to hand him a book you're going to hand him he's going to be presented with the names that was in that book the word is being made flesh in you the revelation this hour is in his church it's in his people he writes it upon your heart that's what we got to get hold of in every expression let me say it all the rules i got to go all the rules that people want to make it's a shame and we've taken a message that god has given us in this day and made it rulebook out of it and all you do when you make a rule book out this message you will have people that live one thing but their heart is different god be merciful on us to cause people to live their whole lives outwardly being one thing but generally something else is there and that's the reason today please forgive me just for a second but that's when you see people walking away today walking away today it's because the truth is they live by rules but their hearts have never came in contact with christ on any of it including me shame on me if all i'm interested is bringing people to rules and regulations and not getting them to christ i don't want something manufactured i tell you boys there's a genuine holy ghost there's a genuine christ that gets on the inside and you will like i told you won't do this i i told this boy that you borrow my commit no it's wonderful the day that when your mom and daddy and i'm not saying they would but i'm just saying and when god gives it to you your mom and dad will walk away there'll be an inside power that keeps you because you ain't saved cause mom and daddy said you met christ for yourself he's come down on the inside of you and you become a living tabernacle for living god to dwell in let me read this to you i wish i had more time but it just is what it is brother branham said when a man possesses these kind of things the holy ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift god's god you might do that but until these virtues go in there you're still off the real foundation of faith and when these virtues go in you're added to that then you're a living monument listen this you're a living moving idle my when i was a boy this day what they taught me they taught me i could fast enough for god to see all my fasting and he would let me see angels not have visitation manuals i've been to the mountains of west virginia i fasted 21 days straight faster 28 days straight i've been on a 40 day fast i fasted 30 days never went a week without fasting fats and so much i ruined my eyes as a young man starving myself thinking harry find god about the only visions i ever had along fast was the clouds looked like mashed potatoes i kid you not i'd get so hungry looking at the sky said angle ever come to you well i could tell you one night in a little place called douglas georgia laying in a bed yeah there was a man that stood the edge into my bed but i can tell you now it was not an angel it was a demon he was dressed in a black suit he stood there and he talked to me when he was done with me told me nobody cared i was wasting my time and ought to commit that's his words you ought to commit suicide he stood the end of my bed i never could understand that quite the way it should have been understood until i come to this message and i hear a man that did fast but not like that he taught me that them things were enticing spirits of the devil no bible he said for men to go along fast shave my head one time bald went home my mother was so upset what in the world i sit in a barbie chair in a little place in middle florida near calif ocala florida got in the barber chair the woman said i said cut it off she said what i said cut it off she said are you joining army i said i just joined it i'm in it she said really i said yes shave it up i'm starting my army of the lord she shaved it off and i went home my mother saw you know what i thought if i shaved my head i killed pride i had a sackcloth outfit laid in sackcloth and burned ashes and rubbed it on my bald head for three days laid in a room wouldn't come out you know when i come off him fast i had just as much pride as i did before i started had just much temper as i did before i started i was still angry like i always was still had a fighting spirit like i always did and what i found out it's not all the rituals and all the fast and all that kind of and that's all fine and good but i'm just telling you that cannot be a substitute for meeting a real christ one day at 18 years old tipton georgia preached a little tip meeting a young man come and set that service invited me to his house when i went to his house he introduced me to the message and i got brother bam's tapes and i'm telling you something happened something took place things that i've wondered about my whole life things i could not comprehend how i watched me and standing on the platform on my eyes up and make me watch them cast out devils watch blinded eyes open of a little black girl and she read aside and she never could read i watched with these two eyes make me stand there and watch that make me steady keep your eyes open watch me catch this devil out and i stand and watch it knowing the man that's making me standing and watching has done left his wife run off with another woman left her rubbed another woman but he was still cast out devils and healing the sick and i was confused god when he gave me this message young people he called me out of babylon this message didn't confuse me it unconfused me this message answered every question i had one sermon called anointed was in the end time answered every question i had on my heart back there in the pentecostal church god i couldn't go back i couldn't go back and argue with them preachers i tried and all they did was mocked and made fun one man i was close to i've been on him with on a 40-day fast rode in the car with him well i ate he would not eat i was with him traveling in the ministry no he didn't touch a bite of food and watch him stand up watched him one night matter of fact i was in a hotel room with him and i'm just trying to show you that you can approach this to religion you can approach this through rituals and and i know you understand what i'm saying this message is not rules it's not regulation it's not a bunch of creeds it's not just just a rule book to you it's a life it's living it's the holy ghost it's eternal god when he gets in you you become a living sacrifice him you walk around as representing god to the world i stood in this car going out to harrison arkansas got in a hotel one night he i laid on the bed he laid on the side on the floor with his head against the bed and the man wept all night long and i'll be honest as a little boy in my mind 17 years old 16 70 years old i thought when is he ever going to stop when he quit literally got tired of hearing a man cry that next night got up that morning he goes to bed not go outside come back in the middle of the day he's back crying again go to the church that night he's starting to poop in he's weeping as a young man sitting on the back row i saw him the crowd about 300 he went to weeping again so why is he crying like that he told that young man said god came to me last night told me tonight is your night he'll never deal with you again if you don't come tonight in three days they'll call me and ask me to bury you this is your night your last opportunity to come to christ that boy sat there with his hands folded shook his head refused to listen to what that preacher had to say i kid you not we left the house in florida on the third day you got a call from that pastor said would you come back that boy you spoke that night he died in the car wreck we want you to preach the funeral he said i will not do it i watch god use men like that he told me one night down there in east point florida on top on a platform with his head praying against a oregon bench the back door opened up he told me he said this he didn't know i didn't know anything about brother batman he said the back door opened up and a man walked in he said you ever heard of william branham no sir don't know who he is said he appeared to me i said he did yeah he said but i believe he had a message for me but fear struck me and he disappeared i said oh i just let it go i didn't know nothing about what he was talking about didn't know if it was true or not but a year later i meet a man by the name william branham's tapes and i get the books and i drive to jeffersonville i get all the tapes and the books i can and i'm so happy i can't wait to get back down there to crawford mills florida to take this message to this cert cert same individual when i got there i started telling i found the message that you thought we oh no no no no and when i started tip up the message he started mocking a cloud he started mocking this and i said how in the world can men be anointed to do all that and they turn down the word how in the world can they do that how could it be so annoyed and deny the word of god and then i realized and i wish i could read it to you but it's right here you say brother madam i got the bat and holy ghost he said that's good it happened every day of your life getting lost you know why young people you can get it on this flesh and i've seen them shout shout shout shout shout shout get up behind they have camp meetings and all they want to do is push out and shout and shout i know where that leads to i know where that goes and you'll try to live and you won't think god is god if you don't have an emotion i'm here to tell you when you ain't even got an emotion and you don't feel him he's still god then he can your spirit you can have gifts prophesied speaking tongue i've spoken to my whole life prophesied i can tell you stories make your mind spin right down their nail by alabama that happened to me in a woman preacher's church but for the sake of time here's what i'm trying to tell you you can do all that but that soul is going to come in contact with god and brother if it ever comes in contact with god i'll say it like this to you and i'm closing but that serpent came in that garden and beat adam to his wife and when he beat adam's wife he put a seat in there before adam got to her and brother bam said that morning this serpent was ripped that evening adam was with her her womb stayed open and her soul got pregnant with or her broom got praised with two seeds adam in the serpent and then it closed up that was in god's eden let me tell you young people what god did he come down in this hour and satan's eating and he beat satan to you and you know what he did he pregnanted you but this time when the holy ghost pregnanted you he closed your womb up so ain't no other seed can get there amen our soul is for one person and that christ amen he filled us with the holy ghost and he shoot us into christ but that's why we don't listen to other voices contrary to the word amen there's a bride there's a young people sitting here today that's filled with a holy oh seal with christ and you cannot be a seed amen your heart is for one thing and that's his word your your soul is for one thing and that's this message now what you should do is since that message in here and your soul has been quickly eternal now let that soul take this body and bring it up to the word and you live out christ and become a living sacrifice for christ bow your heads if you would tonight this morning
