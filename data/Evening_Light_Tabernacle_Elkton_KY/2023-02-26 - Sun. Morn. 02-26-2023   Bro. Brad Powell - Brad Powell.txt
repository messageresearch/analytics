========================================

I can worship so let's just do that because we really worship God not only in spirit but also in truth amen amen and so uh you know that says the word comes forth the worship him in that but certainly amen uh you know when we go to worship to God it's not about looking at the neighbor or who's here who's not but it's by closing our eyes is just really really seriously worship to God and bringing his atmosphere without amen amen praise the Lord God is good amenities here the Lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of God of Jacob defending now remember still alive we will rejoice in thy salvation in the name of our God we will set up our abandons the Lord fulfill all by petition thank you Lord [Music] you know as you get older and you realize you know talking I say you know when I'm 63 now but I told him the original Mountain I wouldn't apply there isn't you know what I mean by the things I did as a young man I enjoyed and I don't regret was spending people sometimes paying your question the things you did if you got mad but so I don't regret you know the mountains I climb the places I've been but somehow Church of Christ they have pain you should read in this uh uh treasure here the seventh verse it says SunTrust and Charities and some horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God and that's the age we're in everyone is trusting in some Professor whether it's in their wealth or you know whatever that is you know that doesn't mean anything it won't be with you on the other side so the only thing we can really trust me is the experience you guys whether you're young revolves around the simple faith in Jesus Christ this morning if you would challenge me uh I'm just going to read one verse and then I'm going to go determining that I don't mean to be funny about that but yeah I was just thinking you know as being genetic downsizing you see all the things you require from the time you were your young 1820s and now you're in your 60s and you realize those things were important for your men but now at 60 that are not important anymore to wind up giving away or throwing away the things she thought were employed 40 years ago but uh I was just read this first couple of verses here I excuse me I deceased you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God thank you represent your bodies unsacrificed holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and I was thinking this morning it's more than just dividing in the age that we are not on the entire religions here but as I read the scripture you could add something else to do this morning as I finish I just teach you therefore brother and by the mercies of God that you present your mind yes congratulations where the very thoughts around you try to take you away from the word of God or serving the word of God and serving the lord it's we're in an age right now where you have so many different things they didn't in Halls they only had the written word or the spoken word now you can see it on video you can hear it on radio you there's so much more to distract you you it's not just your body you have to present your mind on the soul also but I'll just re-read it again and then go to Q is 12. I seek you there for a Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your body as a Living Sacrifice only in itself oh God causes your reasonable service be not conformed to the world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good and acceptable and the perfect well I'm not going I know I read a lot but that's really important for you let me turn over here if I don't lose my presenting a couple of notion important but turn into Hebrews the 12th chapter I kind of over and over again let me read this uh a couple of these scriptures here wherefore seeing where also Compass about some greater thought of witness British flag side every way of sin which doesn't so easily possess and that's fun with patience the race with the second floors you know we have a great crowd of goodness also for us this day and age you have the written word of God this morning you have that ability to be successful and it goes on to say looking onto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was sent before him endured the cross despise him ashamed and sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God for you we're consider him ignored such contradictions centers against himself we should be wary of feigning your minds and he goes on and said hey you have not resisted onto blood striving against him you have not forgotten the exhortation will speak without you his children my son responds not thousand of the Lord nor faith when thou art For Whom the lord loves teach us and discourage every son he was received you know that's very important this morning you know God builds up our character at this point you know everything we do in life is not perfect so God has developing us it's perfect well and sometimes that's through hard enough from time fresh food easy enough but God is going to develop a character in you that you need on that day this morning and it might be for some time uh it's a hard scrub some of us are hard heads and it takes a lot of beating and a lot of a lot of falling and getting out again before when we realize what God's trying to do for [Music] takes a lot of things a lot of struggle a lot of God bringing us down on our feet again bringing us down to our knees to realize that we're feeling too much in our own strength and we're not doing anything but I I was uh thinking about what I was listening a couple of messages this morning that I'm not going to say where I'm going to say but the thing that really struck me this morning with us as believers and so we try them hard in our lives but do everything we can to be a Son of God or a daughter of God I'm gonna wind up in real life we're doing in our own strength and in our own ability and not we're not stressed with the scriptures we're not pressuring the holy spirit that God gives us but we want to do on his time but I believe this is uh just some some paragraphs that I read this morning and it says you know as a as a body of Christ you have the full power of God this morning and the only thing they're living at you this morning manifesting in your heart of life this morning is your faith certainly God doing the things to act upon him and that's all always just simple we tried making some complicated sometimes but the more simple event in the gospel the more reality you'll have when you are walking out of Faith this morning that God's able to do things for you you know it's not being simple here this morning but these brother man always talks about childlike Faith simple Faith just believe in God because he is God and walking out on faith believing what he's going to do for you and uh and he this is a it's he's on full Full paragraphs here let me everybody try it no you're going to lose it right here see Faith yourself you don't know you have that's right it's just a gift it's just say well you can't well you can't touch the vowel short how do you know what he's trying to say is Faith is a real simple problem this morning it's a real simple way [Music] I've lost my whole track of mine here this morning but I'll just read a few scriptures have you forgotten your expectation would speak about to you my son despite not the chastising my lord your faith when God waste my hand sometimes not allowing my enemies sometimes to bring my faith about when I am getting chasing your reviews and I'll say if you and your chest and God deal with you as good times with son swim in the father chasing down but if he be without chastising him wherefore all are you contagious then you are bastards and not Sons father foreign chastising for the presence seems to be choice for three years nevertheless and yield that the peaceful rooms of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby where was talking about here lift up hands which act down and the feeble knees have been straight past where your feet at least how much his land he turned out of the way but rather be evil and then like he was talking about talking about him reading about it brings her mom on the scene bought peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord look at these diligently we stand a man Fallen by Earth stopped on top at least anywhere division is screaming off trouble thereby many people fall but that's really speaks of this morning that it's an age where people are just so angry so better at each other we don't have Christians we don't want those attributes and all our hearts he's there I'm going to stop by there but uh you know I was I was thinking this morning in my own life as uh as I get older and you know this question is one of the messages that brought around this morning and I realized for myself I can only speak to myself but I just simply need I have a starring beans and rather downsizing I realized just like brother we're talking about unpacking all those things that you don't need to be preparing them in your hard drive I just need 11 more color and just let God out of his way you know not old to the things that I've known just let God speak to me and just walk away he wants me to walk Brother David thank you remaining about the Lord this morning unless they

Christian amen I mean you think of the possibility the Lord will do for you next amen I mean he's going to change your body we have a bright future you got a lot to be excited about it thank you Lord to worship God for us it's important that didn't kill you yet they did 68 Million numbers amen your life and then you've got a good for God's face okay very nice and uh we started off on Wednesday night because of meeting at the church and uh and uh for that information I don't remember if you said Wednesday or Friday night one thing that stood out to me he said uh Satan is afraid of what one Ergo will do for your faith or if you can get up one or one will do your faith just take to the next level that really dropped in my heart um because I know sometimes like on the Christian walk it can see like inside of so many prayers and so imagine I still keep the answer but we're just not seeing that the way we want to see a dancer and so I was kind of discouraged sometimes I've been praying for healing for some things and for Elena showing her stuff for my ankles different but I'm just pick up on that and leave on that if I just get that one Miracle just one thing that I can just believe on so as many of you know um I've been left as a tolerant for many years and um it's just brutal and [Music] even a little less than cheese or anything it just set me off a milk ice cream all that stuff so I have to carry around a big pill while the library and every time I'm going to have cheese or anything I can take like five six pills that's just and if you have something to eat something that you didn't know that was in there well it's gonna be a time so um I think it was Friday night uh after the meeting they were serving a staff and uh it was cold and stormy outside our cabin where you're staying way far away from the mess hall and uh me and Lee are up to the front for the line I saw the pizza for a snack and uh so I asked them like hey you got my bills right all right foreign about that for you okay and uh I never really thought of it it was just such a simple thing there was a solution for it with Bill so I never thought I was getting healed from it and uh so we got mine and I just took one slice of pizza went up to my seat and uh I was like I need to pray over this pizza and I'm very so sincere for that one little piece of pizza and uh so I ate it and just believed and stepped out and I hate that it's about to happen as I can usually with at least five minutes I've had to put out there and uh so I was like all right that was kind of you know the devil started talking to me he didn't have that much cheese on there just different thoughts like that and I was like no that's all right so the next night I just kept playing it kept leaving it the next night they had cheese and bread with dinners tonight see what happens so I took two pieces I'm right over that very sincerely again and just believed and um [Music] so um then on Sunday afterwards Leo would wanted Mexican food when we were coming down to the camp so we bought Mexican food and then we went to a friend's house named pizza and I was like well now it's been a female test so just three slices of pizza cheesy Mexican food all but things all or nothing and just nothing happened I began to testify people in the kitchen I'm like I'm Healed okay [Applause] I was I couldn't believe it so I was really happy with that my parents house to search for testified on Monday evening the two things that would set me off the worst was ice cream straight around two percent little so on Monday evening I lived with my parents region and they're like poured some ice cream in there I remember when Peter got out of the boat he was he was walking he was watching when he started to look around and start getting nerves well I see the ice cream there I literally was afraid of the ice cream and I was like man that's just not so bad and Satan was like just on my case and I'm afraid of it and so I left the room I love the crate on the floor I can't start doubting now I know you healed me and even if this does cause an accident well I don't care I don't just go first I went in the kitchen scooped up some ice cream and had it like a big bowl of it and I just testified everybody in there I said I'm gonna eat this ice cream Laura already touched me all the things nothing happened it was just been a total healing I just want to thank the Lord amen and I know some of the Bride says stood up to this point because I was talking awesome I'm going to church about him he's like you feel like anything when I come over how are you did it feel like a cold chill or like anything that was like no a number of the Browns wrote that quote about sometimes I think it's so simple you don't even know it's there and it was just it was just it didn't feel like anything out of the hotel you don't like it came down I was like taking this over or anything like that I'm just like I said God and God works like meal so I'm gonna believe it and not a big deal I don't feel anything special at that and just thought drop drop that bait down there so I just wanted the Lord [Applause] thank you Sam is an Amazing Grace [Applause] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank God [Music] [Applause] [Music] so very much [Music] foreign [Music] what we normally would but as you turn them in your Bibles we want to read out the book of Hebrews chapter 11. I think we will go right along with the things that have been said and done this morning and you know I didn't really put a title on this but as I was listening to the free service and so forth last night I thought if you know if I could put a title on her if I would put a title on this it would be the way maker amen and when we reach after 11 Hebrews we know that we're in a world of negativity that's what we're facing and you know the prophet said that there's a real there's a focus if there's a real dollar there's a counterfeit if there's Faith there's fear there's doubt there's belief and dark good and evil positive negative and if you're a Christian this morning the negativity is is even more poured upon you from the world the world's against us we're living in the most negative place outside of hell and none of us are going there right that the world has ever seen and you know the negativity surrounds us but that doesn't mean we have to fall into that trap of negativity yeah our children should have to follow oh man and I read a stat the other day that said the average on the average an 18 year old child or a young adult 18 year old has been told no or you can't do something over a hundred and fifty thousand times wow yeah think about that you better know or you can't do something a hundred and fifty thousand times but my Bible tells me differently and so today we want to look at that and we'll read out a portion we're going to try to keep you staying home but I don't want to read several uh several of the verses out of Hebrews chapter 11. and it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen I like that when we look at that word substance substance okay for it the elders are coming to do the report through faithful things which are seen or not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered I've got a more excellent sacrifice the King by which he obtained the witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it not being dead yet speaking so here's Abel now think about this here he had the foresight and here's what we could talk about faith and fear Abel had the foresight to see so far into the future that he could see that there was going to be a bloody lamb to die on the cross of calvary now that's faith something something was placed inside him that he could see that far in advance to say hey this is not about beauty and flowers and and crops and he said this it's about a bloody ram somebody that's going to sacrifice this is what a sacrifice is yeah that's his faith huh I mean Enoch was translated he should not see death and was not found because he had this testimony that he pleased God so now we're looking at Enon Enoch had the foresight to see that we're going to take a rapture that there is a possibility so that there will be a group of people that can leave this place in the moment in the twinkling of an eye without dying yeah think about this this is the most powerful one of the most powerful chapters in The Bible and we Overlook it so many times because we've heard it over and over and over right well I'll tell you we need it over and over and over and I need it over and over and over build my faith Lord but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that comes to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so that tells me right there that if you're going to be praying to God if you're going to be seeking God I better know who God is you have to have that faith for him to reward you yeah no it's more than just hope amen yeah Glory my faith Noah being warned of God of the things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an art to the saving of his house in which it was condemned condemned the world it became heir of righteousness which by faith which is by faith heir of righteousness who is that today that's us we're the heir of righteousness we're the heir of all four things we're the air because we are the Bride of Jesus Christ about Saint Abraham when he was called to go out to a place where she should after a receipt for an inheritance obey that he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he subturned to the land of promise in a strange country wealthy Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob shares with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is gone he could see someone substance to the world to those around they thought he was crazy but he said I see this I can I can see it as plain as they it's real to me I know it's real I know God is making something happen here and there is a city whose Builder and maker is God yes thank you Lord that's right through faith also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she passed AIDS because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore spring there even one of him as good as dead so many as stars of the multitude of the sky all these died in faith all these people have this faith and what's it say next not having received the promises but having seen them before or off and were what Chris Lane today that God is the Mighty God yes and God is a faithful God I stand persuaded that I'm going to take a Rapture I'm going to I stand persuade that I can live a positive life I don't have to dwell in the neighborhood I stand persuaded that I can be victorious this morning yes straight from being your house this morning yes Lord we definitely feel your presence amongst us and we pray that you just have your will your way this morning Lord that you yes Jesus what you've laid on my heart yes help us all to relax and yes and we just want to tell you we love and we appreciate it we dedicate this service completely into your control and into your hands yes amen amen you can have your seats is a rather long chapter I keep you standing too long we'll bounce around a little bit in here but chapter verse 17 says by faith Abraham when he was tried he offered up Isaac that he would receive the promise offered up by his only begotten son by faith Isaac blessed Jacob but he saw concerning what things do come that gives room for the devil to throw in some doubt but so these guys had to overcome and how to stand on faith and the word tells us late that he stood there by faith with concerning the things that were to come and by faith Jacob when he was dying he blessed the sons of Joseph and they worshiped everybody Joseph when he died he made mention of the part of the children and then Commandments returning his bones he's alive he's saying I know what they're going to do you need to get my bones moving over here take them with us him by Moses when he was come to gears he what refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter he had it all everything he could possibly want or need or Desiring life was laying right at his fingertips and he says I refuse to be called because that's not what I see myself man I can't place myself in that bondage and to go with that so he said I would rather suffer the afflictions of God everybody suffered and enjoyed these Pleasures for a season by faith Egypt and it says not fear and I want you to remember that I want you to think about that faith and fear cannot come as this did you realize that faith and fear cannot coexist and I want you to know this that your mind wants positive thoughts yeah Lord your mind was designed by God to think positive yes it is if I give you a statement you can't take it wants to try this on me yesterday and he said don't think about an elephant and then he said what did you think about I said elephant he said I thought you don't do it he said if I tell you don't do whatever you're going to do and think whatever I just thought I'd never thought about it that way but that's the truth our minds are programmed to think positive to stay away from the negative he was telling me don't do something don't do something I did exactly the homicide don't do I thought of enough you ever want to be sitting here thought of an elephant your minds are Incredible God is incredible yes and when we look at this today we think about this and you can't help but go further and think about this when when I went through the Red Sea it was by their faith that the land was dry and it says when the walls of Jericho failed what brought those walls down that was their faith it was their positive outlook in their faith of what God could do in their life and so I want to look and do things a little differently this morning I'm gonna like I said I'm gonna try to relax I'm not really preaching this morning I'm doing something a little different I'm going to speak to you from my heart something I've never done in public and I'm going to share a little bit about myself where I came from where I'm at in my life and what brought me to the spots I'm at in my life what God has done for me and more importantly what God can do for you amen yes Lord we hear all this talk about revival going on and I began to ponder and I began to think and you know I begin to think about this this for Bob's going on because I think why are so many people still living below their god-given rice yeah why would we call ourselves Christians and we're living life without victory [Applause] ourselves living without overcoming power why do we find ourselves uh not fully trusted God the confidence we should have in our heart that lives that no matter what we're going through God will see us through I truly believe that we should be the most Victorious of God praising people on the face of Facebook [Applause] yeah yes thank you Lord several times and you know I don't know uh I don't know why but several times over the last few months people have been asking me please don't take this wrong result I thank myself what's the things you've accomplished in your life how did you become a registered nurse how did you become successful in sales how did you become a confident speaker before how did you how did you do all this and then Thomas really but this kept coming on come on and then God kind of laid on my heart and says you know what people's looking and noticing you and they're noticing bits that I've done over you in your life [Music] thank you Lord Jesus this is a hard thing for me to do because even though I love my life I tell you I can talk to a stop sign I'm a very private person my family were very proud to people parents are very proud to people we don't care a lot about ourselves or about what we're going through tonight I hope some people they just view everything on Facebook you know if the dog kind of hang tail you know everything that's not us that's not my people that's not the way we are Glory but I've learned early in Ministry you learn this the early in my Ministry I learned that brother knows what I'm talking about his kids know what I'm talking about you live in a fishbowl your whole life is on display before the people everything you do everything you say every word you go every act everything you do somebody's gonna see it and have a comment or a reaction to it it goes to the territory our kids they they take the worst part of it most of the time because of the kids do what kids do they're just kids but yet they're they're kind of picked apart you know that's the preacher's gift that's a semester you know and you're kind of picked apart yeah boys you better have broad shoulders and big skin and that's the way it is and we're okay with that but I want you to know from the very start as I began to get into this testimony in this event today that everything I have in life my parents my kids my wife my own my career everything I have I give complete glory to God yeah that's right I accomplished nothing yes amen that's the truth but I'm thankful that I can say that I give God the glory that every step has been completely orchestrated by him in my life and the people in my life when I began to think about this testimony and I I got to this point and I I realized that there were key moments in my life King people keep situation things that have happened years ago that have placed me where I am today that's right how did I not realize that you were in this from all from the very the [Applause] every stroke but I went through every trial I went through every Victory I had everything on one every time I something good happened it was you and the good and it was you in the bad leaving me to where I'm at today yeah that's right that's all they get to think about that I thought remember we start right here Proverbs 22 and 6. and it says train up the child in the way he should go and when he is open he will not depart from foreign I was encouraged I was inspired that's a young boy my parents always told me you can do anything you set your mind to I was taught to respect my elders I was taught morals I was called ethics I was taught to work hard and you'd be rewarded in life I was taught that sometimes life was important I was taught that death of those who was close to you could be cruel and hurt I lost a man when I was it still hurts she meant so much to it but walls turned about eighth grade yeah but I can remember that some Life Goes On the hurts to thank the grooming that life can throw at you but I just hope you get yourself up and be dust off and life goes on you pick up the pieces and you put it all back together I was taught that you pulled for a hundred dollars all right yeah and to hurt for those that are hurt I think about the underdog I I tell you what I I can watch a film today I just cry and composite they knew they were going to win no matter what you could push them to the limits in other words I can remember the story he was one of my favorites I can remember one of the first books that I can remember is that big royal blue kids Storybook of Bible probably everybody probably had it in their homes more than likely the big Royal Blue Book and Jesus on the front if I remember right animals on around him lamb and that was one of the first one of the books I remembered my parents give it to I also remember the first Bible that my parents gave me how I was encouraged to go to Vacation Bible schools and Sunday schools and always trying to be involved around that same to people with and you know Sesame Street that's what I want something to seemed horrible to happen to me or Elementary School Spears worry anxiety panic it came into my life every little time when I just knew that bad things were fixing to happen there was nothing I could do to combat it I just knew something bad was going to happen while I was at school mom was going to be in a car wreck dad would go get her to work out here and doing something while hearing about there's somebody in my family was dead or sick or hurt in the fear the word of the panic this was something mom and dad would help me with because they didn't understand they didn't know what they were at their wishes or we don't know what we're going to do why did somebody hurt you in school somebody knew someone no what's wrong so I would refuse to go to school and I would cry School well I was talking to anything I wanted in life and I told him I wasn't going to school kind of backside don't but I can remember he took me to my grandmother it was all the way and he said you need to drive up you've got to go to school we can't keep none of this no not going I'm not going if you don't go I'm fixing to work you out where are we at for the longest time
