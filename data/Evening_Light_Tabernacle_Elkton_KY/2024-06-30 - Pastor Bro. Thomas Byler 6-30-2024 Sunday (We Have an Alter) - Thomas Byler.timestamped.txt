[21:49] good morning if we all would stand and
[21:51] the children can be dismiss for Sunday
[21:53] School
[21:58] brother Glenn would you open us up in a
[22:00] word of Prayer
[22:44] amen if we would turn to Romans 6
[23:05] we'll read verses uh 1 through
[23:08] 14 what shall we say then shall we
[23:11] continue in sin that Grace May
[23:19] abound know ye not that so many of us
[23:22] were baptized into Jesus Christ we
[23:24] baptized into his death
[23:40] for if we have been planted together in
[23:42] the likeness of his death we shall be
[23:44] also in the likeness of his
[23:57] resurrection for he that is dead is
[23:59] freed from
[24:06] sin knowing that Christ being raised
[24:09] from the dead dieth no more death hath
[24:11] no more dominion over
[24:20] him likewise reckon ye also yourselves
[24:23] to be dead indeed unto sin but alive
[24:26] unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[24:36] neither yield ye your members as in
[24:38] instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin
[24:41] but yield yourselves unto God as those
[24:43] that are alive from the dead and your
[24:45] members as instruments of righteousness
[24:48] unto God this one together for sin Shall
[24:51] Have No Dominion over you for ye are not
[24:54] under the law but under grace brother
[24:57] Brian
[25:10] you can
[25:14] seated you know that last verse in that
[25:17] chapter is one of those ones you hear in
[25:20] those Bible tracks where it says for the
[25:22] wages of sin is death but the gift of
[25:24] God is eternal life through Jesus Christ
[25:26] Our Lord I was reading one of those
[25:28] quotes up there I was just
[25:31] thinking what do we have to to worry
[25:33] about you know the life wants to make
[25:35] you worry about everything this age
[25:38] wants to make you to worry about
[25:40] everything but if you're really
[25:41] committed and God has put you on the
[25:43] path there isn't anything to worry about
[25:46] anymore in the life that we live you
[25:48] know as I get older just myself as a man
[25:52] I don't like starting
[26:15] your
[26:49] are
[27:14] voice that probably didn't when I was
[27:17] just he was coming to the prayer line
[27:19] and as he was coming to the end where he
[27:21] wasn't
[27:23] revealing what is in the hearts of the
[27:26] people the people's Faith was starting
[27:28] to wave because they weren't seeing that
[27:30] revealed and he was admonishing them
[27:34] that they shouldn't be that way no
[27:36] matter what he's saying to those people
[27:39] their faith alone should be enough to
[27:41] heal them of their afflictions and their
[27:43] desire what they need in their life you
[27:45] don't need to see it in a physical form
[27:47] if you have the faith of Jesus Christ
[27:50] abiding in your heart as good Gentiles
[27:52] you just reach out in faith believ in
[27:54] God's word and he'll bring it about in
[27:56] your hearts and lives this morning
[27:58] morning but if you would turn with me to
[28:00] um Hebrews the 12th chapter I'll try not
[28:03] to scream in the mic this
[28:06] morning I was
[28:08] um I was reading a a different
[28:12] devotional this morning and
[28:15] um this is what someone had to say uh if
[28:19] I don't if I didn't lose it this morning
[28:21] yeah but um I'll just read these couple
[28:24] of these verses this
[28:26] morning but the the one thing about
[28:29] where we're at this morning is that we
[28:31] all need to be patient in the age that
[28:34] we live in don't let the things of life
[28:37] or the things going on out in the world
[28:39] don't let them Shake Your Foundation
[28:41] this morning so I'll just read what Paul
[28:44] had to say here and I and you know you
[28:47] have confidence in the message of yah
[28:49] that you can say Paul wrote the book of
[28:51] Hebrews everyone else will want to argue
[28:53] with you about there out there in the
[28:55] world you know and I think they want to
[28:57] argue with with you because if Paul
[28:59] wrote it then it's just as inspired as
[29:01] any other part of the Bible is and it
[29:04] goes to say here wherefore seeing we
[29:06] also are compassed about with such great
[29:09] cloud of witness let us lay aside every
[29:13] weight and the sin that which do so
[29:15] easily beset us and let us run with
[29:18] patience the race that is set before us
[29:21] and and like any good uh Christian you
[29:24] you believe the word of God you're going
[29:26] to apply that by faith and life looking
[29:29] on to Jesus the author and the finisher
[29:31] of our faith for who for the joy that
[29:35] was set before him endured the cross
[29:39] despising despising the shame sat down
[29:42] at the right hand of God and the Throne
[29:44] of God and for considered him that
[29:47] endureth such contradictions of Sinners
[29:50] against himself least he be wary and
[29:52] faint in your minds and I was let me
[29:54] turn here if you want to turn you can
[29:56] turn back to uh
[29:59] Psalms the uh 39th and 40th chapter I'm
[30:03] not read those right now there's some
[30:06] scriptures in there I was going to read
[30:08] this
[30:09] morning but this is what this man he was
[30:11] using that scripture there this morning
[30:14] but this is really striking for the day
[30:17] you know this is 80 years old what when
[30:20] he wrote This Was 80 years ago but uh
[30:23] the scripture he uses the one I just
[30:25] read let us not run with patience the
[30:28] race that set before us looking on to
[30:30] Jesus the author and finish of our faith
[30:33] but this is what this man had to say
[30:35] here we are not willing to admit many of
[30:38] our spiritual weaknesses I got to raise
[30:40] most of us are that way you really don't
[30:42] want to look at yourself really too hard
[30:45] sometimes or what your weaknesses are
[30:48] but he most of us will admit that we are
[30:50] impatient with our friends the
[30:52] government even God himself I know none
[30:56] of us would admit to this but sometimes
[30:58] we get impatient when we don't see God
[31:01] doing for us what we think he should be
[31:03] doing for us in the time that we think
[31:05] it is makes us impatient sometimes and
[31:08] the worst thing to be is impatient makes
[31:10] you make maybe make a decision or walk
[31:13] out in something without the will of the
[31:15] Lord and find yourself being wrong but
[31:18] he goes on we would like to he goes on
[31:21] to say we' like to possess our souls in
[31:23] patience but how in Heaven's name can we
[31:27] is there a secret of patience the writer
[31:30] of the Epistles to the Hebrews replies
[31:32] the secret is to concentrate upon the
[31:34] one who is patience incarnate so to be
[31:38] patient that means everything in your
[31:40] life has to be focused on Jesus Christ
[31:42] this morning and I can't pronounce this
[31:46] this Bible scholar from a thousand years
[31:49] ago but I'll just I miss name once he
[31:52] said the Pharisees should have
[31:54] recognized who Christ was by his
[31:56] patience but I was you know just being a
[31:59] Bible reader like I am I'm reading that
[32:02] sentence but if you go to Matthews the
[32:05] I'm not going to read five chapters but
[32:08] if you go from like Matthew the 22th
[32:11] chapter to like the 26th chapter Jesus
[32:14] got to a point in his life I don't know
[32:17] if I just turn this off but he got to a
[32:19] point where he couldn't where he
[32:22] couldn't keep quiet anymore with the
[32:25] Pharisees and all of a sudden he just
[32:27] let them know
[32:29] what they were in God's eyes but I'll
[32:31] just read in his Temptations he refused
[32:33] to shortcut the fame and Power in his
[32:36] dealings with his Apostles he had
[32:39] constant disappointments and never lost
[32:41] Faith and Hope upon the cross he was
[32:44] patient even with those who crucified
[32:46] and prayed for them he was an active
[32:49] excuse me he had active patience patient
[32:52] does not mean passivity though also you
[32:55] can be patient with people but you still
[32:57] got to tell tell them the truth sometime
[32:59] and lead him the way they need to be I
[33:02] lost my place what what I was doing
[33:05] reading here you have to forgive me I
[33:07] have a habit of doing that it means
[33:09] doing our best in the confidence that
[33:11] God will use our best and the right
[33:13] results will follow you are not to sit
[33:16] with patience but to run with patience
[33:18] it doesn't mean you don't stop doing
[33:20] things waiting on God to give you an
[33:22] answer you just keep doing what a
[33:24] Christian's supposed to be doing anyone
[33:26] who has learned a new language or how to
[33:28] play a music knows that active patient
[33:30] is much much as work is to be done in
[33:33] faith in order the results May follow
[33:35] Jesus could run with patience a course
[33:38] that was set before him with all its
[33:40] hardship because his faith that God
[33:43] would use his life that of the apparent
[33:45] defeat would come Victory and I was just
[33:48] something in my mind reading
[33:50] that excuse
[33:52] me he was able to do that because he
[33:55] knew who he was in the scriptures just
[33:57] like this morning we have to know who we
[34:00] are this morning in the scriptures and
[34:02] if once you know that and you have that
[34:04] Revelation this morning you'll have the
[34:06] faith that you need to be successful in
[34:08] the age that we live and I'll just read
[34:10] a few more scriptures
[34:13] here with not having a lot to say but if
[34:16] you would turn I'm reading from the 40th
[34:19] Psalm this morning I'm going to read
[34:20] like three or four or five
[34:23] verses and it says uh this is what David
[34:26] had I waited patiently for the Lord and
[34:30] He inclined onto me and heard my cry so
[34:33] David knew these principles also he
[34:35] waited on the Lord patiently to get his
[34:38] answer he brought me up also out of the
[34:41] horrible pit and out of the myy clay and
[34:44] set my feet upon a rock and established
[34:47] my goings so it wasn't David doing it
[34:50] was God doing it for him he hath put a
[34:52] new song in my mouth even praise unto
[34:55] our God many shall see it and shall fear
[34:58] and trust in the Lord and blessed is
[35:01] that man that make the Lord his trust
[35:03] and respect not the proud nor such as to
[35:06] turn aside to lies so basically you're
[35:10] no matter what's going on in life you
[35:11] don't put others before or after others
[35:14] everything you do in life is consistent
[35:17] David is saying here many oh Lord my God
[35:20] are thy wonderful Works which thou has
[35:23] done and thy thoughts which are usw that
[35:27] cannot be reckoned up in order onto thee
[35:31] if I would declare and speak of them
[35:33] they are more than can be numbered and
[35:35] what strikes me about that scripture
[35:37] right there is we forget that God thinks
[35:40] about us God cares about us he has
[35:42] thoughts about you he has desires for
[35:44] you you're just not a a statue or
[35:47] something out there just moving to and
[35:50] fro without no concern God has concern
[35:53] for us all this morning he has a desire
[35:55] for you and your life this morning and
[35:57] sometimes times we just don't fathom how
[35:59] much God loves and cares for us this
[36:01] morning and then he I'll finish the I I
[36:05] lost my place but I'll finish with the
[36:08] sixth verse this morning sacrifice and
[36:11] offerings that did not desire mine ears
[36:14] has thou opened birth offerings sin
[36:16] offerings H has thou not reced and I
[36:20] I'll I know I'll just keep reading if I
[36:22] don't stop this morning you know the
[36:25] most comforting thought in the day that
[36:27] we live this
[36:28] morning I would say it's just like that
[36:31] quote said this morning what are you
[36:33] worried about what do you what I mean
[36:35] there are things that you have to be
[36:36] concerned about but when it comes to
[36:39] your soul and your relationship with
[36:41] Jesus Christ just there shouldn't be any
[36:44] worry if God has started that walk in
[36:46] your life this morning he's going to
[36:48] finish it this morning I it goes back to
[36:52] I can only as a Bible reader go back to
[36:54] the Bible and it goes back to uh first
[36:57] Corin thians the 13th chapter you know
[36:59] love Hope and Faith if those three
[37:02] things abide in you this morning there's
[37:04] nothing in your life that's going to
[37:07] stand between you and him this morning
[37:09] as long as you put your whole hope and
[37:11] trust in him this morning brother Josh
[37:41] man welcome everybody this morning come
[37:43] we sing Victory in Jesus number
[37:47] 22 I heard an old old
[37:51] Story how a savior came from Glory

[38:01] Calvary to save a rich like
[38:05] me I heard about his

[1:03:51] all the good music we got here at the
[1:03:52] church amen and all the sacrifice they
[1:03:55] make amen to be here amen and
[1:03:58] uh the service along amen they certainly
[1:04:02] do that so praise the Lord you can be
[1:04:06] seated
[1:04:12] amen I guess the hot dog days of summer
[1:04:15] have arrived haven't they amen it is hot
[1:04:19] amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so
[1:04:23] I've got a couple announcements that I
[1:04:24] want to make amen and so amen if I can
[1:04:29] remember all of them amen that July 4th
[1:04:33] is going to be on Thursday so amen we're
[1:04:36] going to move the service this week to
[1:04:38] Tuesday night okay instead of Wednesday
[1:04:41] night it'll be Tuesday at 7 okay that
[1:04:44] way you have night before July 4th and
[1:04:47] all that spend you with your family or
[1:04:48] whatever amen and then next Saturday we
[1:04:52] have brother Jesse Smith amen from up in
[1:04:55] l Ohio coming amen y'all probably don't
[1:04:58] know him I don't know him all that well
[1:05:01] but I did go up there and visit him and
[1:05:03] I really got fed amen whenever I got
[1:05:05] there and he reminded me somewhat of
[1:05:07] John steaman amen and so uh but he had a
[1:05:11] real good amen worship service small
[1:05:13] group maybe 15 people amen but it was
[1:05:16] very good worship just the atmosphere
[1:05:18] was really good and so I really liked
[1:05:20] him and I so I wanted to felt led to
[1:05:22] have him down here sometime and so he's
[1:05:23] going to come this coming next weekend
[1:05:26] which will be the first weekend our
[1:05:27] first weekend amen but I'd like to
[1:05:30] change things up also amen because he is
[1:05:33] all the way from up there and it's at
[1:05:35] least a 9-h hour drive probably at least
[1:05:38] from where he is usually takes me about
[1:05:40] eight or so where I go and he's still
[1:05:41] north of that amen so and also busy so
[1:05:45] he asked if we could maybe do a Saturday
[1:05:46] night Sunday morning service amen so
[1:05:49] that way in Sunday afternoon he can go
[1:05:51] back amen uh so he does have obligations
[1:05:54] and so I said I think we we could
[1:05:55] probably make that work how many can
[1:05:57] make that work amen we'll do Saturday
[1:05:59] night amen service and we won't have any
[1:06:02] uh communion or uh our carry in next
[1:06:05] week next weekend at all amen amen and
[1:06:08] we'll just hold off on that and so uh
[1:06:11] give him plenty of time to minister
[1:06:12] Saturday night and also Sunday morning
[1:06:14] Sunday night Saturday night at six
[1:06:16] o'clock I think we talked about maybe
[1:06:18] having at six o'l Saturday night and
[1:06:21] then regular time Sunday morning 10:30
[1:06:23] okay but no food amen just
[1:06:26] and worship and so forth that sound like

[1:06:30] September meetings amen I called brother
[1:06:33] kidy digs amen that's one brother Brad
[1:06:35] maybe suggest that we have and I I've

[1:06:50] to come uh the first weekend in

[1:08:22] have a couple families that want to go
[1:08:23] to brother Ron Spencer but amen so far
[1:08:26] it's only been a few of them so amen I
[1:08:28] think we've got enough help and
[1:08:29] everything you know that we can amen
[1:08:31] certainly manage and and have that and
[1:08:34] we'll see how that turns out would that

[1:08:38] how to do it and that's what I kind of

[1:08:44] amen so praise the Lord and that'll be
[1:08:46] of course in September amen then August

[1:09:01] ministers lined up amen amen so praise
[1:09:04] the Lord we've I don't know about you
[1:09:06] but so far this year I've enjoyed the
[1:09:08] ministers we've had to come through
[1:09:09] haven't you amen and so Pastor is always
[1:09:13] particular about who comes amen what's
[1:09:16] said and what kind of food that you eat
[1:09:18] amen amen I care about that amen because
[1:09:21] I believe we uh and I tell you we just
[1:09:24] had just a real good wholesome food all
[1:09:27] right through so amen we appreciate the
[1:09:29] Lord and what he's doing amen and his
[1:09:32] goodness to us this morning amen I just
[1:09:35] have a little thought Amen on that's
[1:09:39] what God is for it's basically the
[1:09:41] thought that came to my mind so that's
[1:09:43] not my title we have a title called we
[1:09:46] have an altar amen but amen I remember a
[1:09:49] song that said went something to the
[1:09:52] extent that's what the altar is for amen
[1:09:55] amen you don't have to carry your
[1:09:56] burdens anymore that's what that's for
[1:09:59] amen and so we want to see just what God
[1:10:01] is for amen amen and so it's kind of
[1:10:04] different but amen it won't be amen
[1:10:07] anything just too out there but if you
[1:10:09] will stand with me we'll just pray and
[1:10:11] ask God to come in a special way and
[1:10:13] amen and have his way this morning once
[1:10:16] again amen really enjoyed that last song
[1:10:19] Amen because it certainly goes along
[1:10:21] with what we want to speak on Amen even
[1:10:24] as it did Wednesday amen Lord Jesus we
[1:10:28] bow our heads Lord Jesus father to the
[1:10:31] dust even as your Prophet said many
[1:10:32] times from where we were made Lord for
[1:10:35] in this flesh and in this body that's
[1:10:37] all we are is a little bit of dirt but
[1:10:40] father we realize that inside of that
[1:10:41] dirt Lord there's something worth 10,000
[1:10:44] worlds Lord father it's so valuable it's
[1:10:47] worth father 10,000 worlds and that is
[1:10:49] our soul that's our being that's the
[1:10:52] life that we have father and Lord we
[1:10:55] come before you this morning Lord Jesus
[1:10:57] and we ask God that once again you would
[1:10:59] just have your Divine Way in the service
[1:11:01] father bless those be with those God the
[1:11:04] elderly especially that are streaming
[1:11:06] those that can't be here for whatever
[1:11:08] reason Lord that they would just bless
[1:11:10] them as they stream and may it be clear
[1:11:13] and father may we may may they receive
[1:11:15] the word father that as it goes forth
[1:11:19] Lord we believe God that as we can just
[1:11:21] receive it and accept your word as it
[1:11:23] comes father miracles can happen father
[1:11:26] so many times we've heard father of
[1:11:28] people streaming Lord and you going and
[1:11:30] doing something special Lord if there's
[1:11:32] somebody out there that needs a Special
[1:11:34] Touch father may you touch them in a
[1:11:36] special way this morning we think of
[1:11:38] sister margorie Lord Jesus in a special
[1:11:40] way this morning she's requested prayer
[1:11:42] father the doctor says the blood is not
[1:11:44] where it her blood is not where it
[1:11:46] should be yet he wants her to go to the
[1:11:48] hospital and get an IV and get more iron
[1:11:50] put in Lord and she's just requested
[1:11:52] prayer and father we do ask God that you
[1:11:54] will get the iron and everything else
[1:11:56] that's supposed to be right in her blood
[1:11:58] Lord and get it to where it should be
[1:11:59] and so she can have strength and health
[1:12:01] Lord she's requested it you said ask
[1:12:04] what you will and you'll do it father
[1:12:06] and we believe it Lord father for you
[1:12:08] know every heart every need that's here
[1:12:10] in the congregation this morning Lord
[1:12:13] and we just pray father you'll come and
[1:12:14] Minister Lord Jesus to those needs for
[1:12:17] that's what you are for and that's what
[1:12:19] you do that's who you are and father we
[1:12:22] ask God that you just bless the
[1:12:23] meditation of a heart and that which you
[1:12:25] if you let on laid on my heart to speak
[1:12:27] this morning Father may it benefit and
[1:12:29] edify the body of Christ Lord in Jesus
[1:12:32] Christ name amen and
[1:12:35] amen all right let's turn our bibles if
[1:12:38] you
[1:12:43] will let's go to
[1:12:45] Hebrews 13
[1:12:59] just a couple scriptures and a few
[1:13:02] quotes
[1:13:05] amen amen I guess I'll just share my
[1:13:08] thought amen I thought about just a
[1:13:11] small T title and you know brother
[1:13:13] brandham had a lot of small titles but
[1:13:15] he did he said you know it's not the
[1:13:17] amount of words that it is isn't that
[1:13:19] right but what's what those words mean
[1:13:22] and the power behind it amen that's what
[1:13:24] it's it's all about amen just like that
[1:13:27] little stamp amen that little boy sold
[1:13:30] is that right it was worth so much
[1:13:32] because of what was on it and that's the
[1:13:34] way the Bible is because of what's on it
[1:13:37] amen and uh that's just the way it is
[1:13:41] with the the Bible amen just couple of
[1:13:44] words like if thou can't believe all
[1:13:47] things are possible amen it's few words
[1:13:51] but it's lot of power behind it amen
[1:13:56] amen so that's the word of God okay
[1:13:59] Hebrews amen
[1:14:03] Hebrews 13 and
[1:14:06] 10 we have an altar amen we have an
[1:14:11] altar whereof they have no right to eat
[1:14:14] which serve the Tabernacle and then over
[1:14:18] in St Luke if you would let's go to St
[1:14:23] Luke 4
[1:14:36] St Luke
[1:14:44] 4 14 and Jesus returned in the power of
[1:14:48] the spirit unto Galilee and there went
[1:14:50] out a Fame of him through all the
[1:14:53] regions round about and he taught in
[1:14:56] their synagogues being glorified of all
[1:14:58] and he came to Nazareth where he had
[1:15:00] been brought up and as his custom was he
[1:15:04] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[1:15:06] day and stood up for to read and there
[1:15:10] was delivered unto him the book of the
[1:15:11] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[1:15:13] the book he found the place where it is
[1:15:16] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:15:18] me because he has anointed me to preach
[1:15:21] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:15:23] heal the broken heart it to preach
[1:15:26] Deliverance to the captives and the
[1:15:28] recovering of the sight of the Blind and
[1:15:32] to set at Liberty them that are bruised
[1:15:35] amen may God add His blessings to the
[1:15:36] reading of the word you can be
[1:15:42] seated amen praise the lord well let me
[1:15:46] just kind of follow my notes Here for a
[1:15:51] minute we talk about God Amen
[1:15:55] being not even God at one time he was
[1:15:58] just a self-existing one a that right
[1:16:02] all by
[1:16:04] himself amen and I got to thinking you
[1:16:08] know God was sufficient in
[1:16:11] himself
[1:16:13] amen he was perfectly at peace with
[1:16:17] himself by
[1:16:20] himself nobody could ever even think our
[1:16:23] finite Minds can't even imagine how long
[1:16:27] it was that God was by
[1:16:30] himself Ain that right it's
[1:16:33] incomprehensible is
[1:16:35] it yeah that's
[1:16:38] right but we know that he is amen and he
[1:16:42] had what I say Amen uh perhaps what we
[1:16:46] would might call a treasure box in
[1:16:49] heaven all right he had a treasure
[1:16:53] box amen because how many knows that God
[1:16:57] himself is a treasure
[1:17:01] box yeah I think Jesus said something
[1:17:04] that the Kingdom of Heaven is like a
[1:17:06] treasure right that a man found in a
[1:17:11] field amen he found this treasure in the
[1:17:14] field and hid it I guess and went and
[1:17:18] sold all that he had and went and bought
[1:17:21] that
[1:17:23] field amen
[1:17:25] he went and bought that field a't that
[1:17:28] right and that's the way God is he's got
[1:17:31] he's this treasure he he could have
[1:17:33] stayed by
[1:17:35] himself he could have stayed
[1:17:42] alone y was quiet this
[1:17:46] morning got to say something I guess
[1:17:49] before you get all excited don't
[1:17:53] I but my thought was aren't you
[1:17:58] glad aren't you glad he
[1:18:02] didn't
[1:18:04] W yeah I'm glad he didn't stay by
[1:18:10] himself I'm glad he didn't keep his
[1:18:13] treasure to
[1:18:15] himself but what did he do he opened up
[1:18:18] the
[1:18:21] treasures all of The Treasure of Heaven
[1:18:25] he opened it
[1:18:27] up and he said whosoever
[1:18:30] will let him
[1:18:32] come come and get some of this
[1:18:38] treasure here's a question for you I
[1:18:40] like asking y'all
[1:18:42] questions what is the greatest
[1:18:45] treasure that you
[1:18:48] have I believe brother Braham said it
[1:18:50] was
[1:18:51] life preached on life the greatest thing
[1:18:55] that there is is
[1:18:57] life well if you didn't have life you
[1:18:59] just wouldn't have much would
[1:19:01] you no so all the other things that
[1:19:04] pertain to life those may be valuable
[1:19:08] and good but the fact that you have life
[1:19:11] that's most important that's what's real
[1:19:17] valuable amen and not just your natural
[1:19:20] life that your mom and dad gave you or
[1:19:22] that come from Mom and Dad is that right
[1:19:25] not just that life because that life we
[1:19:27] know will end up in
[1:19:30] misery it'll end up in
[1:19:32] death it comes the wrong way it's got
[1:19:35] the wrong desire it's got the wrong
[1:19:37] nature to begin
[1:19:40] with amen so there's not a whole lot to
[1:19:43] that
[1:19:44] life but now when you've got another
[1:19:47] kind of Life John 3:16
[1:19:51] life he gave his only begotten son so
[1:19:54] that who
[1:19:55] whever amen how many believes Jesus
[1:19:59] Christ died on the altar so to speak
[1:20:03] shed his blood on the
[1:20:05] altar so that you could become a
[1:20:09] possessor of the great Treasures of
[1:20:14] Heaven

[1:20:47] most of the time you get a response but
[1:20:50] I want to talk about that response and
[1:20:52] God expects a response
[1:20:55] and can I say God's going to get a
[1:20:56] response there's going to be a response
[1:20:59] to what God

[1:25:19] comes oh my how many knows and I've
[1:25:22] preached on this before I like this this
[1:25:24] this thought and that is that we are a
[1:25:26] very needy
[1:25:28] people this world is very needy and God
[1:25:31] allowed us to get into a needy
[1:25:34] Place why because he's The Specialist of
[1:25:38] meeting your needs that's what he
[1:25:43] does is meet people's needs Paul said I
[1:25:46] believe he says my God shall supply all
[1:25:49] your needs according to his riches in
[1:25:51] Christ
[1:25:52] Jesus oh
[1:25:55] your
[1:25:59] name no wonder we act

[1:26:45] have need of in this life in death and

[1:27:08] a little bit deeper believe that a
[1:27:12] little bit
[1:27:18] stronger
[1:27:22] amen praise
[1:27:25] Lord God is good so that's what he
[1:27:30] is
[1:27:33] now I

[1:27:39] this after this thought came to
[1:27:42] me but brother Brandon preached
[1:27:44] something
[1:27:47] similar and I got some quotes from it

[1:28:10] was it given for what's it
[1:28:13] for the power of prayer the power of
[1:28:16] speech the power of a holy life that's
[1:28:18] what the Holy Ghost is to do some of you

[1:31:51] of
[1:31:52] calvary or should I'd say this side of
[1:31:55] Calvary not the other side this side of
[1:31:58] Calvary when brother Bram he listened to
[1:32:01] that message that day on Calvary you
[1:32:03] talk about a powerful
[1:32:05] message
[1:32:08] amen because he said on that side they
[1:32:11] all looked they all looked to Calvary to
[1:32:14] that one that was supposed to
[1:32:17] come this is one time that brother B
[1:32:19] says and every Christian down through
[1:32:21] all of time since then has always look
[1:32:24] back to
[1:32:28] Calvary amen years I spent my uh days in
[1:32:33] vanity and pride knowing not that my
[1:32:35] Lord was
[1:32:36] crucified amen not knowing that it was
[1:32:40] for me that he died where on
[1:32:42] Calvary it was Calvary that did it it's
[1:32:46] your faith in Calvary it's your faith in
[1:32:48] the
[1:32:49] cross it's your faith in the blood and
[1:32:52] the power of the blood that's that's
[1:32:53] where your faith lies what he did the
[1:32:57] price being paid

[1:33:47] goats they'd offer it every year every

[2:10:40] you you know there's something about it
[2:10:43] I don't care it wasn't too long ago but
[2:10:46] I believe that when a preacher if we as
[2:10:49] ministers when we come up here we're not
[2:10:51] on the job or one thing we have to learn
[2:10:54] to do is just forget about your own
[2:10:56] abilities is that right and give
[2:10:58] yourself to God
[2:11:00] 100% mind Spirit soul and body did you
[2:11:06] ever notice it wasn't so long ago just
[2:11:08] about two weeks ago I seen brother Ron
[2:11:10] Spencer making some kind of an
[2:11:12] illustration laying right on the floor
[2:11:14] right like this getting all in it
[2:11:16] trusted with his body physically right

[2:11:30] and everything else and they get back
[2:11:34] up they get all in it Body Soul and
[2:11:38] Spirit how many believ that's the way
[2:11:41] our congregation ought to and me we get
[2:11:43] so comfortable sitting right there why

[2:11:48] yeah that's right preach it brother

[2:11:55] Spirit most of the time any preachers

[2:11:59] good not not I'm saying I saying that
[2:12:01] they're not anointed and everything I
[2:12:03] believe they are got good lessons and
[2:12:05] everything
[2:12:06] else but it gets real interesting when
[2:12:09] everybody gets all physical about it

[2:24:53] Josh you got that

[2:25:02] Lord Lord
[2:25:04] Jesus as we bow our heads
[2:25:07] Lord and father I've spoken Lord
[2:25:11] of how that even our thoughts can cause
[2:25:17] us to be
[2:25:18] disturbed it can bring spirits
[2:25:21] can make us
[2:25:22] upset but Lord when we're meditating on
[2:25:25] you as I have been this week Lord you
[2:25:28] lay little things like this on My Heart
[2:25:30] Lord it may be simple but Lord I realize
[2:25:32] and believe that it's really good it's
[2:25:33] really great to think of who you are
[2:25:36] what you are what you've done not what
[2:25:38] we are and what we have done when we
[2:25:41] think of why you have made a provision
[2:25:42] Lord for everything that we have need of
[2:25:44] Lord and for how great that you are Lord
[2:25:48] it makes me feel just as I have acted
[2:25:50] this morning under your anointing it
[2:25:53] makes us
[2:25:54] rejoice it makes us to have joy
[2:25:56] unspeakable and full of Glory makes us
[2:25:59] to have peace that passes
[2:26:02] understanding when we think on the right
[2:26:05] things when we keep our minds on you
[2:26:08] stayed on you changes us and I pray
[2:26:12] father for this congregation father this
[2:26:14] evening light Tabernacle my precious
[2:26:16] brothers and sisters who I've journeyed
[2:26:18] on a long way now father with we all
[2:26:22] know each other
[2:26:23] Lord and father I believe God that we're
[2:26:26] unifying like never before Lord so we
[2:26:30] have each other's backs Lord when one's
[2:26:32] down we all go to
[2:26:34] praying we pray right now Lord Jesus n
[2:26:37] father I pray father for each one and
[2:26:42] myself that you would cause us to be
[2:26:45] able to walk the way that you want us to
[2:26:48] walk to thank think the way that you
[2:26:50] want us to think to worship and to cause
[2:26:54] a worship in our hearts for what you
[2:26:56] have done in our lives and that you are
[2:26:58] doing every day and having this
[2:27:01] confidence that no matter what the
[2:27:03] future holds we know that you're going
[2:27:05] to lead us to yourself to a Rapture to a
[2:27:08] heaven to a millennium to be with you
[2:27:11] forever and ever and ever and we realize
[2:27:15] it's going to be beyond anything that
[2:27:17] what we can imagine but we pray pray
[2:27:20] father this morning that you would hear
[2:27:22] that you would bless each one that hears
[2:27:25] this this
[2:27:26] morning Father we walk with you and a
[2:27:29] preparation in their hearts to be ready
[2:27:30] father when you
[2:27:32] come Lord when we think of our
[2:27:36] politics the world that we're living in
[2:27:38] and how it's going and when the world is
[2:27:41] anticipating perhaps for Trump to win
[2:27:43] and things to get better Lord maybe it
[2:27:46] will but I thought Lord that would be a
[2:27:49] perfect time when everybody thinks it'll
[2:27:51] be a little longer and then there you
[2:27:53] are you come when people aren't
[2:27:55] expecting it but Lord I pray that
