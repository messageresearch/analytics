might say well you made it back it wasn't no big deal you drive very much and you'll see if you make it home in the afternoon it's a big deal and I call it crazy Clarksville because those people are crazy but you know I got to thinking and I talked to a friend of mine brother Joel Smith he lives in Dyersburg and his mother and I went by and seen her her name is naen Patterson and she's another one that I've known ever since I've been breathing and she's in her 90s and she desires prayer she's doesn't have much strength in her legs and and brother Joel asked me he said does Brother Brad pal

little course turn your eyes up on Jesus as brother Thomas comes and that's the reason we're here tonight is because of him tonight not nothing me or you or brother Thomas as great a man as brother Thomas is a great a pastor it's still the Lord Jesus tonight and that's the Lord Jesus and all of us you know we all look at our faults how many gets angry at their s but you know what he don't see

let's just bow our heads am I on are we good all right Lord Jesus we come before you father tonight thanking you lord lord for safe returns Lord Jesus from our trips Lord Jesus all that traveled and we just desire God that you just once again be with sister margorie in a special way Lord as she needs a touch Lord in her legs and arms as they're still tingling Lord and so forth different things

that we go through and we can cast our cares upon you because we know that you care for us Lord we ask God that you just bless our meditation the thought that we feel Lord You've laid upon my heart father to speak on we just ask God that it go out and receive father and bring forth a h hundredfold Lord realizing father that we just want to say what you want to say father and that it would Lord edify the body of Christ Christ Lord bless the reading of the word bless each one that has Come Bless every effort for we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen amen praise the Lord so amen if you will we'll just go right into the word this evening let's turn to Isaiah 14 i w to speak on deceived worship deceived worship amen more or less a negative message amen amen so we know that when you're talking about the bride of Christ when we're talking about the light there should be light in the evening time and how that God is perfecting a church and getting it all ready for him to take away we know there's another side of it we know there's another church isin't that right amen that is deceived and so we want to look at Deception with the little help of the Lord deception and I was telling my wife on the way to uh on the way to coming com here amen just thinking about uh how easy it is to be deceived amen very easy much easier than what you might think as a matter of fact on might statement beginning and that is there's only one way really that you'll not be deceived and that's through the holy spirit amen because you can't even see the kingdom of God right without being born again Jesus said you can't even see it so if you're not changed in your nature and in your thinking most of the time people that that are wrong think they're right amen and so amen we know that there's going to be a lot of that Amen on the day of judgment it's people who thought they were right and were not amen so amen we're going to begin with the devil's ambition in Isaiah 14 and verse 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou down to the ground which D weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven and I will exalt is that word exalt my name my Throne oh my my throne above the stars of God and will sit also in the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds and I will be like the most high may God add His blessings to reading of the word you can be seated this evening amen amen in 2 Thessalonians 2 and verse 3 and 4 it says let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first And that son of and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worship there's that word worship again amen remember we're talking about deceived Worship in other words amen they're worshiping but they're deceived about what they're worshiping amen so that he as God sth in the temple of God brother Brandon makes a direct quote and very direct statement so he's in the church he's a church is that right that's where he is amen sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God so the ultimate goal of the devil is to be worshiped amen that's his goal and we realize let me just uh read your quote right quick Satan's eating brother bam says he said that he would exalt himself above the most high he would he would Ascend above the clouds and the Stars and he would sit there like God and be above the most high and he has succeeded in carrying out his threats imagine a prophet of God coming along and making a statement that he has now succeeded in other words he has achieved his ambition his goal he's achieved it and we want to carefully Look Tonight with the help of the Lorden how he does that amen praise the Lord all right he has certainly succeeded in carrying out his threats he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's promised word for that age amen with the help of the Lord we'll talk about a little bit about one way that he does deceive people is he allows them to live in the glare of another age or um what is it say to believe what God has done in the past all right to believe what God has done in the past but reject what he does in the present is to worship the devil I hope everybody out there hears this to believe what God has done in the past but refuse use what he has done in the in front of you is to worship the devil amen my my praise the Lord a pretty strong statement but it's true notice this brother baham says now go back in Genesis which is the beginning Genesis means beginning we find that God gave his family eternal life as long as they stayed in this word and lived by this word but when they broke it just one link of that chain of promises struck him which is a promise also it's a chain you're hanging over hell with it and that's the only thing that'll carry you through when the believer becomes a makeb Believer and lives on one word that's contrary to this word he cuts off his fellowship with God how many believes that if Eve he took Eve Adam and Eve out because of that one word brother B says that God's not going to take you back unless you're believe leing every word Jesus said and he makes a statement man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God a real genuine believer has to believe every word that God has spoke to dis believe one word well it doesn't mean that you just you're worshiping the devil the devil has done exalted himself as soon as they say well that was for another age there's no hope Holy Ghost is you done worshiping the devil because you have brought the devil's knowledge and wisdom above God's word remember he'll be above the stars and and his throne's going to be above God and so he has a say over top of God's word exalts him amen oh my all right so I'm going to iPad it tonight a little bit with the help of the Lord amen can't always do this but whenever I have a message coming quotes coming out of one message and this will be out of Satan's Eden and the God of this evil age Amen brother Brandon first of all he Mak says it this way I wanted to speak to to you something well let me back up just a little bit first of all let's first of all talk I wanted to first of all talk about how I believe that the Bible is inspired how many the Bible is inspired every word of this is inspired amen and over here's the message let me ask you is it inspired it's inspired amen how many how many knows I've read the church age book brother Dale Potter's read the church age book many preachers preach out in church book and it there's an inspiration that goes with it I know preachers and the message don't believe the church age book is really legit because of Lil writing it this out and what they know about but I know one thing that's a it's inspired I preach out of it and I believe it brother brandom never disavowed it is that right and I believe it and so I believe the message is inspired I believe when we read these quotes it's inspired just like the Bible is inspired aren't you glad for that and I want to make the statement you know and and you know with what God did through the prophet's Ministry and all that he did and and raising the dead and Healing The Sick and pointing us right back to that word I've got a lot of confidence his word carries a lot of weight how many believes the prophet's word carries a lot of weight because Jesus Christ would come on the platform and back it up any man that can say if Jesus Christ don't come and do what he did when he walked the shores of Galilee and Hiser and all that you ain't got to believe it is that right but if he does does vindicate it then it's sin for you not to believe it I'll dare say I want to make another statement tonight that I believe that the only way that you're not going to be deceived is through the message of the hour that's how vital it is well brother B you better have scripture for it huh all right y'all run to scripture for it I'll give you scripture for it Revelations 18 we know there's God came down and he declared he cried with a mighty and a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and he become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornications with her notice her how many now go preach half an hour on what brother bam said a woman type and how that she's the only one that could fall she's the only one that could commit fornication no Horse no cow no other no other female can commit fornication ain't that right she was created to where she could ain't that right so how much greater is it than if she could she don't anyway how many believes that's the bride though she could she don't want to she won't anyway that gives her an extra uh extra reward but no doubt but we realize that a church or a woman is the type of the church over in seven chapter 17 and verse three it says he carried me away into the spirit in the wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns and we won't even go into that but he talk called her mysty Babylon the great the mother of harlots and the Abominations of the earth we know that there's only one city sitting on a Seven Hills that's of course Catholicism she is the mother Church she is the Harlot and she had little harlots isn't that right the mother of harlots now oh notice over here this Babylon had fallen oh boy has she ever fallen ain't that right now now condoning LGB stuff gays and lesbians and all that and condoning all that by Catholicism and that right and her little prostitute little little strong word but hard God didn't hold back did he we shouldn't hold back she called her a bunch of committing fornication and so forth and now they are even allowing all of that stuff in become a hold of every foul Spirit unclean bird now to make my point how many believes in order amen that God is going to do something to cause you not to be in all of that all right all right and the merchants of the earth verse three of chapter 18 says and the merchants of the earth that wax Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard somebody say I heard and I heard another voice say from Heaven saying come out of of her if you're not part of that voice that come out of her then how are you ever not going to be deceived the only thing that'll give you the wisdom and the understanding is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Amen to be able to to discern and withand that Antichrist spirit amen the message of the hour I truly believe the only thing that an ability to be able to not be deceived amen my praise the Lord my my my all right so there's your scripture talking about there's a voice that says come out so we know brother bham how many remembers come out remember he said come out of her my people that what the voice said Mighty Angel Mighty voice said come out of her don't be partakers of her sins that you receive not of plagues all right all right now let me back get back to my quote I just wanted to say that just to kind of lay a foundation to make us realize that I love reading the quotes it's inspired God oh boy here we go I can't get off it God backed it up why shouldn't we Jesus backed it up you're going to be in trouble people's going to be in trouble that don't believe what Jesus backed up I'm not ashamed of what God Said Amen so brother Braham speaking here God of this evil age I want to speak to you to bring something to Enlighten you to the promise of God for this age amen one to Enlighten you not something that somebody else was done in some other age them things are all right we refer to those things but I thought I would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures that I got here a lot of the things the ones I read already that would Enlighten you to know to make you a better Soldier for the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you see that's the main thing is to learn how to keep the punches off of you as much as you can I like that to be a better Soldier to learn the tactics to to make sure that he doesn't deceive you most deceptive age ever is what you and I are are are living in amen now I notice so now let us look at this great for a few minutes great sinful day that we're now living in I don't believe there ever was a day that we've ever lived in history amen I'm just it's going to stop there the great sinful day that we're living in not only in Morality but also in the Sin of unbelief how many's with me there's so much unbelief of what God has done in this generation more sin than ever Jesus walked the shores of Galilee isn't that right amen it preached to just so many brother B said just 100th of 1% maybe ever knew that he was even here but what about the prophet going world over Africa India half a million at a time through the media ain't that right through everything we have to spread that gospel now they can hear it so much more and then they either have to accept it or they have to reject it they'll either Believe it or they will sin and not believe oh my never has there been a greater day now listen there's been greater days of persecution when the children of God was put to death on every hand but to see the deceitfulness of the en we've never had a day like this that we're living in now it's the most cunning deceitful day and when you see that it brings this that the Christian has to be more on his toe today than he has in any other age now they back in the days of the persecution of R and to the Church a chrisan made a mistake he went into the arena and was fed to the Lions perhaps you had to be careful not to come out not to be caught you had to hide in the kind of catacombs or hide this out or the other but if you got caught a't that right they found out even going on a bus different ones that got caught talking on a bus and and talking to a priest and they exposed themselves as a Christian and that priest when he got off would have him arrested and taken and killed they had be careful a't that right but listen to what the prophet of God is trying to say he says listen they would make a mistake he went into the arena and was fed to Lions or something like that when they found him of being a Christian for his testimony but his soul was saved because he was a purely unadulterated believer in God and gladly sealed his testimony with his blood as the veins let loose holes in his body perhaps a lion or a blade or whatever it is and the blood bled out and he would scream with royal fa and say receive my spirit oh Lord Jesus but now the cunningness of the devil now makes people believe that they are Christian when they are not let me tell you something oh you'll get to it there is the thing you don't have to se seal it's a more cunning day than it would be that when you had to seal your life away with your testimony the devil has set every cunning trap that he can he's a deceiver he told us in Matthew 24 how that this day would be that we're living is the most deceitful day that we ever lived how many believes that let me quickly read that Matthew 24:24 says it this way then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ there is Christ bre believe it not for there shall arise false Christ how many knows but false anointed once brother talked about he people will be falsely anointed they will be true anointed but they will be false vessels amen that's how he explained it they're false christs amen and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect praise the Lord how many's glad to believe that you are elect if you are elect then you don't want you want to make sure you're not deceived amen my my we see that it is truly only the elect that deceived is so deceiving and we don't want to go too far in it but we realize that that number is little straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there be that find it remember brother bam I believe it was a vision or a dream one that he had of a woman amen trying to go up to heaven make it Heaven on this road with high heeled shoes and he said you can't do it with that you can't make it oh be quiet I can die yeah I can yeah I can There She Goes Ming and so forth with her high heels and after a while she stumbles and off she goes huh well I guess that should take care of her preach us preaching on high heels then wouldn't it don't have to worry about that anymore amen but there's things that you know people think they can do and so forth you know but that's right now um let me just go again one more scripture that I'll clear up here on on those only those who uh only those who are elected will not be deceived and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him Revelations 13 and8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship remember we're talking about deceived worship they shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world wow amen praise the Lord so we realize that it was easy maybe just to give you life in that hour but in this hour you're going to have to be on your turn new I wanted to go into it and didn't didn't but I'll just mention it amen how that how that the devil is out to kill to steal and destroy and I'm sure probably every one of us would like to know everything there is to know about the devil coming and trying to ride you and steal from you deceive you isn't that right that's all he wants to do is kill deceive and and so forth amen praise the Lord now notice so he says now we read also in Revelations 3 and4 rather the layad of see a church age that how at the church in these last days it says that it would sit a wiow and have need of nothing now I think that's actually found way further back in Revelation 17 or somewhere talking about I said a queen and I'm no you know I'm a widow and I have need of nothing but he ties it in with that same woman and increase with Goods let's look at that for just a minute we're going to take our time on this one amen we're all familiar with it Revelations 3 and we'll begin with verse 15 I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou word cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold or hot I will spew thee out of my mouth before we read any further we're talking about what brother bam said about there'll be people that think that they are Christians and they're not I want to go down this road here but that's why I want to say that it's so important that we have that we check up about what kind of fruit that we're paying ain't that right let me just read this and we'll go over there to that part because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing knowest not that thou artart wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked am me go down to verse 19 we're going to stop this other and as I many as I love I rebuke and be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice I will come into to him and will s with him and he with me let me finish this quote now notice he says the last phrase the last word is what makes it so striking they think that they were well filled with with the spirit they're already the leosia age is the Pentecostal age because it's the last Church age Luther had his message Wesley had his message Pentecost message also I said that because that you're lukewarm neither cold nor hot amen the emotions of the outside the mental conception of the gospel because he said you're that way and I'm going to spew you out of my mouth in other words it made him sick to see the church in that condition remember they spewed him out how many knows that they had put him out in this age I stand at the door anytime that you put Christ the word out you're worshiping the devil thinking you're worshiping God how those Pentecostals after brother bam declared they are dead Methodist dead Baptist Dead all them denomination he said dead now there was a time he didn't say that because they was God was still in there but after they rejected him and after they put Christ on the outside they came and they had speaking in tongues they had beat up piano they had dancing they had shouting they still do today but they're there worshiping the devil thinking they're worshiping God my whole thought came from what brother Braham said about there'll be millions and billions worshiping the devil thinking they're worshiping God why brother Brandon would say that that amount of people deception amen all right we're gonna take our time but I think we should be pretty close Okay so listen they spewed him out and he was on the outside of church trying to get back on the inside in that awful lead ofia age the guy out of this world today worshiped the worship person of this world today is Satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan I want to say something they use to they sing the same gospel songs that you sing they read out of the same Bible that you they talk about the Lord Jesus like you talk about the Lord Jesus hello amen but yet they're actually worshiping the devil because all it takes is one word you just reject one word of God one word my that's pretty strong listen they are ignorant of worshiping Satan but it's Satan imperson himself as the church see as the church they worship Satan thinking that they are worshiping God through that church remember better bam said you know that a woman is more deceiving than any bar or any beer joint or all of that is that right not and not so it's naturally that way but he said the implication that he was making he says it's the church that's more deceiving than anything else is that what he said the church is the most dece receiving institution on the face of the Earth cuz people go in there they want to serve God is't that right but yet they are deceived by it wow amen it's strong but it's the truth and all they have to do is well our church don't teach it that way all right worship the devil then that's exactly what's going to happen when they do when they say that we don't believe that I don't believe that that was for another day you're worshiping the devil right there rejecting the truth oh my it's going to get good are you ready it's going to get better yet look back to my text now wait a minute so uh now notice they're worshiping Satan thinking they are worshiping God through the church but it's the way Satan done it oh you see but wait a minute you say but wait a minute we preach the word look back there at my text Satan was the one that preached the word first to Eve a't that right he preached the word sure he did oh but that it doesn't really mean that that's all you got to say there you go swallowed the devil's lie doesn't really mean what it says makes you feel like slapping somebody right you telling me God doesn't his God's word doesn't really mean what he says what are you a fool God does mean what he says if there's anybody that you better listen to It's when God speaks don't worry about when man speaks but if God says something you better take heed if he said said you better man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedes out of the mouth of God Amen shall Man live by then you better live by every word you better believe every word oh my let me see here so listen so that's right so he says it's that misconstrued that part of the scripture that applies to today he'll let you know all Jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know that all that Moses did was perfectly well he'll but when you take the promises that they gave for this day amen listen that this day he says then that was applied to another age that's just all he has to do see is to get the people to believe it that way that's all amen you cannot take one word away from it or add one word to it or your part will be taken out of the book of life people ignorantly worshiping Satan thinking they're worshiping God as they are warned by prophecy in 2 Thessalonians amen he says then he reads it and so forth amen let no man deceive you by any means for that they shall not come except they come of Falling Away first first amen that deceitfulness of the Church of today see the son of predation the devil the son of predition the devil people worshiping Satan in this day thinking they're worshiping God and they're worshiping him through a Creed a manmade denominations and Creeds that brought people right back down to the greatest deception that the world has ever known of no matter how much the word of God promised for this day is preached vindicate it they still won't believe it they won't believe it now how is not believing your message for this hour part of worshiping the devil let's get a scriptures I want to go to a scripture let me see if I can stay with my with the plan here I believe it's in Matthew or is it St John yeah St John 3 St John 8 let's look at now if people are just worshiping the god of History if you just worship the god of History you're worshiping the devil pretty strong because if you don't re worship the god of the I am right in front of you how we could bring in how many knows the indictment didn't brother baham says I indict this not not just worshiping devil now but actually he indicted this bunch of group bunch of clergy this generation the church and the ministers and all of them for the second crucifix is that right shpping the devil and crucifying the Lord Jesus Christ I mean know that's exactly what the scribes and Pharisees did they worshiped their Creeds and their dogmas and would not take the manifested Jesus in front of them and he said if you don't believe that I am he you will die sins he said there's a day that if I wouldn't have showed you and what I have showed you your sin would have been covered but now you see now you're no longer innocent they answered him verse 33 we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free down in verse chap verse 38 of chapter 8 I speak that which I have seen with my father and ye do that which you have seen with your father then answered they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father see claiming to be the children of Abraham and let no doubt but could point to it in their genetics and lineage ain't that right and Jesus answered said and they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus sath unto them if ye were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that has told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham ye do the Deeds of your father amen he says then said they unto him we be not born of fornication we have one father even God I mean know they claimed that God was their God just like today people say well I believe God I believe Jesus I believe what he did my whole sermon up there this weekend was you know people believe that Jesus died people say they believe but what does it mean to say that you believe amen if you really believe you'll believe what he did you'll believe that he paid for your sins amen and that you need have your sins remitted amen and you'll get the benefits of the remission of sins amen and your baptism of the Holy Ghost because God wants to remit your sin amen and he wants to fill you with the baptism the Holy Ghost which is God himself amen if you don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you never believe the way that you ought to believe God comes down and you become the temple of God you become a representative of God your actions become the works that I do shall you do also if that if ain't that and you're just a mental believer of fictitional God Amen and what we got today is brother B said it he said another another thing is you know that they'll be hey highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God amen truth Breakers and everything having the form of God in us amen they'll be Church guards but they'll deny the power that'll bring them to a change devil worshippers that believe in Jesus but they deny the power there of devil worshippers they want to stay like they are don't want to change don't want to be holy want to dress how do however they are want amen devil workers amen started out up there with you know unless you take up your cross and follow him ain't that right you're not worthy of it in other words that's dying to yourself that's dying to that old nature people want to keep that old nature all of that and still profess Christianity you're deceived amen all right praise the Lord so where we at if God were your father you would love me amen if God is your father you'll love what God does in your day let me say something else just comes to mind so I might as well but you know the other thing about the message of this hour is Amen in the Old Testament remember God says you know this uh you I want you to tell what happened here to your children let them tell their children amen David says I want to always have be telling and testifying of the testimonies of God Amen and she we should never be ashamed of testifying of the testimony of Jesus Christ and what he did in our day as a matter of fact we're supposed to tell our children they're supposed to tell T children to n down how many believe that that's right see it's all the testimonies of God in this hour doesn't matter what it is I love the I love the stories of the of what God has done in this hour and of what God is doing in my life and your life isn't that right amen I proceeded forth from God and I neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word woo think about it now these people were worshippers they sang song everything the way that God had said they made sacrifices and everything else but they had absolutely been blinded by their Creeds and their dogmas and their man-made ideas can and I say what it comes to my mind what about people that add to this message want to have a message the way did you want to have a message want to have a church the way you want to have a a church worshiping the devil and don't realize it it has to be God's way how many how many knows you can't misplace this word it has to be in God's will it has to be God's will he has to go be God's purpose otherwise you're off very easy amen takes a lot of prayer now notice he says look we can't hear my word you are of your father the devil even they said you snakes you serpents you generation vipers how can you escape the damn nation of Hell talking about a religious priest preachers and church let me ask you who were they worshiping oh God we love you we love you love you people say oh Jesus we love you and love you and love you and they're worshiping the devil is that a little hard for it to get to our head but it's the truth why because in their hearts remember Jesus says these people honor me with their lips they worship me with their lips and with their tongue but their heart is far from me it's somewhere else they love the uppermost seats they had all these things they wanted to kill Jesus amen they were so blinded with their man-made things woo come on let me let me read you some more brother Bram says it look when Jesus came let me see yeah that's as much of that as I want to read he that is of God heareth God's word ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God that's pretty good isn't it applies for our day look when Jesus came Satan was in that bunch of Jewish teachers and rabbis and Priests trying to tell them to keep the law of Moses when the very law said in that day that the son of man would be reveals he that he would reveal himself so they was trying as long as they kept them religious them Devils kept them religious and on the law on Moses see what he did he was trying to tell them that part of the word is just exactly right but this man isn't that person is what the devil was telling them this man's not that person n he's not really a prophet brother Brandon wasn't really a prophet he was the F go ahead seal your destination hello that isn't that person see how deceiving he is that's the real day of deception amen it's the devil telling them to keep the law Moses keep Abraham be a Methodist be a Baptist be a Pentecostal hang on to that evidence of speaking into tongues is you know when you when you speak in tongu the evidence of the Holy Ghost Prophet comes along and says no it's not ah we're going to put him out because he don't believe our do go ahead you're putting Christ out hello believe in some past God just a god of the past and to get you not to believe what God is doing in front of you preacher comes and preaches the pastor preaches something evangelist comes and preaches something across the pulpit hits you right between the eyes and you reject that you reject that you might be a message believer all you can ever be but you're a devil worshipper that's strong you're worshiping the devil because you rejected the Holy Ghost and the absolute word of God coming to you you went some other way let me tell you something be a lot of message people disappointed on that day I don't want to be disappointed I may say Lord show me all my fault Lord help me to not disbelieve one word help me to walk exactly where you want me to walk talk the way you want me to talk live the way you want me to live because the devil tell you oh this don't matter yes it does every word that proceedes out of your mouth am me you'll give a count on it on the day of judgment everything that you do amen we willing all under the blood all right we got a few minutes listen so but that's I like that where he says you know he that devil that devil was in them rabbis telling them to keep the law of Moses keep all of that you know keep doing that brother Braham said one place I read it I think last time you hang on to the traditions of men ain't that right you hang on to those trach man you are not the Bride of Jesus Christ amen now listen it's been and now is Satan establishing his kingdom in the earth that's exactly why he's doing it for he wants to establish his own kingdom now we're going to kind of start over a little bit I mean I I got some quotes out of the out of uh Satan's Eden and and some some out of the God of this evil age listen to this now when the church world would not have the word of God rule over them they accepted a murderer a barabus what this did what did this do it exalted Satan the God of this evil age to the place that he always wanted to be when you any individual in a church or a church preacher whoever it might be when you reject the word of God ain't that right the Living Word of God will not have that to rule over you how many knows there's two two ways you can go you can either be for something or you can oppose it a't that right the devil the devil opposes so anytime you find somebody opposing the word of God whoa what's going on here ain't that right I don't want to be an opposer to the word of God well I don't really believe that or it that's for some other age or do doesn't apply here be careful amen the God of this evil age place he always want now listen for Satan is not spoke of as a god of any other age but this age he wasn't spoken of the god of Noah the age of Noah not the god of Moses the age of Moses or the age of Elijah but this evil age don't miss it he is the God of this evil age worshiped by millions and billions of people ignorantly they don't know it brother Glenn those are not my words all those churches that rejected Jesus Christ are worshiping the devil and that's why he was saying millions and billions of people now I believe there's people in there I I TR feel God's people in there that can come out but they need to stream tonight they need to stream services like this make them realize that if your church doesn't have a standard doesn't go by the Bible women cut their hair they do all the things that they want to do and everything and your preacher says it's okay it's time for you to Boogie on out of there that's right because it's been pronounced by God's Prophet that they're dead and that they're worshiping the devil singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved the WR like me and yet worshiping the devil because their lips may be honoring him but their heart is far from him amen my thank you Caleb you got another Amen Corner over here amen Satan is not spoke of all right millions and billions of people and they don't know it is that right wretched miserable poor blind and naked and don't know it he said that's the crazy part is he don't know it amen but let's let the scripture uncover him next it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped like God he took two thirds of the angels and stars of Heaven ascended up and so forth preached to them ain't that right now he is ready with his selected educated bride by his own knowledge see all painted up in deceit of big buildings and big denominations how many know these mega churches how many like to be a part of a mega church amen I wouldn't either that's right I was in one I went this weekend our service was at 2 o'clock and uh so that people that go to mega churches or whatever whoever wanteded to come they could so I went with my cousin David and they may be listening tonight hopefully they are God bless you if you are but listen I went to that church and went in there and the pre-service music was this hard rock stuff Christian Christian rock F I'm sorry that's it it's all you have to be Christian rock that gives it away wasn't quiet music like what we have know our churches listen to this they had a big screen up front nothing wrong with a big screen we like to have a big screen everything else isn't that right now going into broad is the way is that right the way that the majority of the people are going is not the way that you want to be going no cuz it's just going to be a few Jesus said narrow is the way that leadth to life people don't want people coming out of the Amish they want they don't want laws they don't want rules they simply amen they want all Grace huh and I understand 90% of the mega church right there was was ex Amish a lot of EX Amish even the preacher said here's a new family come from the Schwarz and trober Amish they looked a little Amish in their uh genetics and so forth but you couldn't tell people went all the way from but you got to realize something that Jesus said that unless your righteousness is exceeds that of the Pharisees how many know they had some lot of rules and strict stuff ain't that right he says unless your righteousness exceeds theirs I want to say this that being a Christian I hope they're listening being a Christian is a lot stricter than being Amish David was telling me that I and We Know It that little boy Bo young boys from 14 to about 20 they let him go drink and go to bars and get drunk and just all kinds of crazy stuff they Don't Preach against it they let them have their Wild Oats and then about about 19 20 years how many times straighten up join Church getting married and and stop all that amen of course you know they have bed courtships you know for dating and everything else that's totally unrighteous and Unholy but as long as you belong to them you can go about get away with stuff as long as you repent at the next uh get together or their next communion you know make it right hey as long as you're with them they just let you about do anything ain't that the way churches are but I feel for the people hello amen tell you something of course you know they had good gospel music there they had a band good good uh songs I've got a picture here you know kind of videoed everything and I got a picture of a guy standing there in shorts worshiping God and drinking coffee right in the congregation everybody you know can have coffee are you drinking you know you got to we got to realize something that all those stuff that goes on it's inspired by something the preachers not wearing the halfway you know coming in raggedy clothes and everybody else just wearing casual and being casual they have a casual religion the way they talks C everything's casual I didn't hear one amen I didn't hear one Hallelujah from the congregation amen and let me tell you something we come to the house of God to worship our music and everything else shouldn't be our worship that is what helps you helps me to worship God say hallelujah praise the Lord amen let me go on listen big buildings denominations paints theology smart Ed intellectual educated and deceive the whole world and become a God that's what he's done all heading up into person of the Antichrist which is already found viker of God by his worldly loving scientific all dressed up and PP and artificial and religion education see has made religious like him people are religious I I want to say this that I don't see how you can be worshiping God outside of the new birth huh nobody can even call Jesus to Christ but by the Holy Ghost amen listen to this oh my let me go to the next one notice they the people exalt him above all that's called God don't second Thessalonians so that he say that he would do it the authority and the authority of a denominational Church the people believing that denomination more than they believe God and God is the word they'll believe their denominational Creed above the word which exalts him above of all that's called God in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God if God isn't first in your life hello then the devil is first in your life brother bam says you say the Americans aren't a bunch of idol worshippers you he said Americans are a bunch of idol worshippers and that you put before God is a idol you're worshiping the devil that's got a thing but it's truth God help us never to let anything come in front of God because that's exactly what the devil wants it could be your job it could be your your wife it could be anything it's more important to you than God you put it higher than God it exalts the devil over God pretty strong tonight oh they'll believe their denominational Creed about of the word now notice there's only one God and that's the word all that's called God so he as God sits in the Church of God proving that he is God because he's got the people worshiping him well it doesn't matter how I dress he's got you worshiping him it doesn't matter how I live I can drink a little I can smoke a little I can do this that or the other you're worshiping the devil thinking you're worshiping God he exalts himself above all that's called God there's only one God and that is the word see all that's called God is God is the God of this age has exalted himself above the true Vindicated word of God that's St John all that's above all that's called God so that he set sets in the temple of God showing himself that he is god with authority amen listen now let's watch it be manifested he says that he's making a better world for them to live in by his knowledge apart from the never failing word of God but by his coming together in denomination and Creeds and intellectual scientific and so forth he's making a better world for man to live in and ignoring the promise of God that the only time the world will ever be fit in to live in is know to my opinion he making a better world for people to sin in instead of living isn't that exactly right oh let me read it some more did he do it he legalized sin he legalized Whiskey Drinking cigarette smoking in the church he legal legalized women to be a member of the church with short hair wo may I stop there for just a minute butam says you won't find a bob haired woman in heaven Paul said for her not to cut her hair is that right for it's a dishonorable thing people pop their hair off cut their hair and she can be a member of his church with Bob tear devil worshiping woo come on that's right you broke the word of God you you that's just what Paul said Paul said if you come and preach anything else if you're an angel from heaven let him be a curse that's right drinking smoking all allow if your church allows that your church worships the devil come on folks how about a little backup yeah that's right preach it brother B it's strong but it's a truth let me said I have sad to say and I love those people wish they wish they could really get a hold of the real thing but they've jumped out of the fire into the fry PAAD hello live any old way a lot of people come in there they had nice hair they had dresses on modestly dressed that's woman beside them go out there with her little tight tighty tights on and no skirt hello others with short air and everything else anything goes you got a church that anything goes that is of the devil that's no it's not God doesn't let anything go he wouldn't let Eve go with one word he's not going to let you get in outside of believing every word he legalized all this it's okay they tell you it's okay contrary to the word of God if I do it here ain't that right I'm of the devil anybody not just picking on any certain Church any of them and all of them that reject the word of God for there they and still talk about the Lord hanging on a tree you're still worshiping the devil and you will be lost your soul depends on Amen you can believe it listen Legalize It woman could be immature she can wear shorts wear pants PS oh my brother Brandon really gets down on it don't he she begin to wear his pants is that right and he went out in shorts he wears her underclothes and she wears her his out of clothes he gets long hair she gets short hair perversion and claim to be a Christian you're deceived completely deceived wear shorts wear pants and still belong that his religious group which is absolutely contrary to the word of God he says it's all right see his knowledge what's that got to do with woman just the same as taking the F forbidden fruit God said don't do it and you think you can do it and get by with it you can try it if you'd like but you're going to find it getting pretty hot up ahead oh she believes him and she loves him for it I love it church that I can do anything huh that's what she thinks oh he lets me Everything Jesus don't let you do everything no the Holy Ghost won't let you do this there's a lot of things the Holy Ghost won't let you do even though your flesh wants to amen but if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the way you ought to have you'll overcome that thing but my flesh don't want to go to church go ahead and sit and warm your Pew if you want to or that uh couch you think I always feel like coming to church took me three days to recoup from weekend taking me longer every time matter of fact two hours before I church I come to church I says honey I'm finally revived took me a while I'm ready to go so we're going a little late is that all right listen he's a god of worldly Beauty oh let me go back she believes him she loves him for it God she hates God her own acents prove she does preach the truth and man people ain't going to come hear you no more that's right they don't want to he love the devil she says she loves him but she loves Satan she worships the god of fashion the God of this world Hollywood goddesses amen how many knows not not just about this church I went to but any mega church what they have out there and they had a band up there they had a band up there and they could sing good call the background though the background music is what it's all about and lights my I'm thinking we're taking trying to get some lights to make it look better and so forth now I'm just G to be honest with you I'm gonna be honest with you God help us I thought all we needed was another pole because there was flickering lights or lights with all different colors and so forth all they needed is a little strobe light and a pole and a naked woman and they'd been right by right at home it's right next to it right next to it that's why I'm not too interested in being lit up too much or having all the song and listen we were singing oh uh um what was it we exalt thee we exalt thee we exalt thee Oh Lord isin that right and I thought well good praise the Lord here we are exalting the Lord but I find that these new songs that they come out with I got real concerned with them because they don't mention Jesus or the crucifixion or the cross okay so which Lord are you exalting here oh Lord God you're our God yeah there's a lot of songs that can be applied to the devil I like songs that it's very clear that you're worshiping Jesus [Applause] amen and be in the atmosphere that was there the rock and roll hard for me to see I'm say man who are we worship him up in here cuz when I sing we exalt thee I know who I'm talking to but all the deceived people are going to sing that thinking they're worshiping Jesus when worshiping the devil anything contrary to the word you're worshiping the devil gloves off right that's the truth though I thought my made me leery of lights made me Leary of big screens Brother Brad remember the smoke if we had smoke coming up and entertainment you could have a crowd why Levi he barely had a musician he didn't have hardly anybody we didn't have hardly anything that church blossomed I thought all he'd have to do is do do what they do and I guarantee you half of them will come over to him but who wants all that 90% of it was entertainment 15% was word a little bit of preaching and so forth but most of it was entertainment a quir crowd you couldn't hear Sing at all everybody stood there and watched entertainment Hollywood that's how it is all probably all mega churches hello we don't want Hollywood and the atmosphere like I said the way that people dress coming in there whatever it's casual how many of knows brother baham says that when you come to the house of God don't bring your drinks and everything else and chewing gum people was chewing chewing gum standing there drinking drinks others are arm folded you know looking around coming in casual why do I wear a tie why do I dress up why don't I just wear well I get kicked out have had pants with holes in it and stuff like some of them do but it represents lukewarmness Brother Brad I truly felt that he was represented lukewarmness just a casual religion I don't want no casual religion when I come to the house of God I want the preach to have the preacher preach hell fire and brimstone I want him to preach amen salvation changing the power of the Holy come down isn't that right when we worship we worship with all of our heart am man the singers ain't got to do our singing our choir don't have to sing Our Song we worship him I like for the church for the people to worship Him amen but that's the truth that's what the prophet said amen anything contrary to the word of God the devil's got you worshiping him and you're singing songs to Jesus you can even say Jesus Savior Lord God Amen that isn't there right there if the Holy Spirit isn't there you're worshiping somebody else all right that was last one I swipe and there's another one over there so we'll quit amen but anyway atmosphere the atmosphere amen how many knows we want the sweetness of the Holy Spirit I thought well you know here in closing brother Brandon would have discernment discern the thoughts and the heart isin't that right have prayer have an altar call and so forth and when he got back here he didn't have a great spacular worship it was sneak and LLY I love him I now let's sing I love him because he first love me and purchased my [Music] salvation oh on Cal tree amen sure we enjoy the screen we enjoy everything but how many knows let's stay a far away from the world we're not trying to pattern after the devil we're not trying to pattern after the world we got to be careful folks Church message church has got to be careful amen we want to stay as close to the mountain as possible not see how close to the edge we can get amen so close to the edge man you just about just about in a bar we don't want to be there amen no we want to be in a holy ghost filled place where Jesus is welcome where lives are changed where our young people get the baptism of the Holy Ghost where our children get saved not go off drifting further into the world Amen God bless you let's stand this evening musicians you feel come Lord Jesus we come before you tonight Lord and we honestly say in our hearts father keep us simple Lord keep our hearts humble before you Lord Jesus your Prophet has said so many times that Jesus is not in glamour he's not in Hollywood he's not in all those great things God is in humility Lord Jesus want to think about people who really expect to saved Lord yet if they would come if if you would come like into this church tonight could you say well that's that's the way I want my people to worship that's the way I want my people to dress that's the way I want my people to live Lord because some of the places would you would be so uncomfortable but Lord help this place to be a place where you're comfortable where you're welcome Lord and I pray God tonight help us each one not to be deceived by this music that the devil has blended with hell to that I've listened to and after listening to it in that way I was like my this scares me Lord I ask God help us to make sure that we stay in the middle of the road

girl or a husband or a wife or whatever Lord don't don't let us sing those songs let us make sure that it's you that we're singing to and about God help it to stay clear for the Devil is very cunning
