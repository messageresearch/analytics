[28:20] hear everything that is said in both by
[28:23] their ears but all of our heart
[28:25] lord in this midweek service we've
[28:26] gathered together in your name
[28:28] believing that you'll have your way
[28:30] speak through us lord tonight and have
[28:32] your way in jesus christ's name amen and
[28:35] amen
[28:36] amen turn if you will to the book of
[28:37] hebrews hebrews 1.
[28:46] just had a little thought come to my
[28:48] heart
[28:49] uh
[28:51] and really but it does have
[28:54] to do with god
[28:56] expressing himself amen in his
[28:58] expressions
[28:59] amen it could be otherwise
[29:03] thought of
[29:06] as his attributes but i call it the
[29:08] expressions we want to call it his
[29:09] expressions
[29:11] this evening hebrews 1
[29:13] verse 1 god who had sun dry times in
[29:18] diverse manners
[29:20] spake in
[29:22] times past unto the fathers by the
[29:24] prophets has in these last days spoken
[29:28] unto us by
[29:30] by whom also he made the worlds
[29:34] who being the brightness of his glory
[29:37] being who being the brightness of his
[29:39] glory
[29:40] and the express image of his person
[29:43] and upholding all things by the word of
[29:46] his power when he had by himself
[29:48] purged our sin sat down on the right
[29:51] hand of the majesty on high may god add
[29:55] his blessings to the reading of the word
[29:57] you can be seated amen
[29:59] amen
[30:00] i called it expressions tonight but i
[30:03] want to call it god's expressions amen
[30:05] for one thing but we want to talk about
[30:07] different expressions
[30:09] amen
[30:10] but
[30:11] here we want to start with this word
[30:13] express
[30:16] amen i got to thinking about that word
[30:18] express
[30:21] expressing
[30:24] amen
[30:25] uh and i thought about you know all the
[30:27] different things uh many times perhaps
[30:30] somebody will get scared
[30:32] or something
[30:34] will be said that's real gross
[30:36] and somebody are like ooh
[30:39] you know
[30:39] they'll have facial expressions
[30:42] right
[30:43] we express ourselves a lot of times and
[30:45] you can kind of see what's being said or
[30:47] whatever by the expression
[30:49] that people have
[30:51] amen
[30:54] so tonight
[30:55] with the help of the lord we want to
[30:56] talk a little about this for the with
[30:58] the help of the lord um
[31:04] but you know
[31:06] so
[31:07] it says that christ was the expressed
[31:11] image
[31:12] of his person now that was expressing
[31:15] how many believe that
[31:16] there's a lot of things that's
[31:18] incomprehensible about god such as his
[31:21] uh
[31:23] uh
[31:24] his omniscience all knowing his power
[31:27] how he makes things now he does uh even
[31:30] his existence i never could have had a
[31:31] start a little bit mind blowing you know
[31:34] all these different things but there are
[31:35] things that we can understand i believe
[31:40] uh to a great measure i would say to
[31:42] perfection but i wouldn't want to be
[31:44] wrong and go too far but it does say
[31:46] that jesus christ was the expressed
[31:49] image
[31:50] of god amen i mean he believes that he
[31:53] perfectly
[31:54] expressed
[31:56] who god is
[31:58] and what god is what he
[32:01] he
[32:03] what kind of character that god is i
[32:05] believe if the god talked about the
[32:07] bible being the complete revelation of
[32:09] god
[32:10] things we know about god is
[32:12] part it's that he's loved
[32:15] i mean up to god is love
[32:18] and so he wanted to express that
[32:20] now
[32:21] tonight i want to speak about
[32:24] this expression
[32:27] this expression
[32:29] and i and i heard also on the tape but
[32:31] i'm talking about if somebody or
[32:35] if you love god
[32:37] then he said express it
[32:42] right
[32:43] you have to in other words it you show
[32:45] it and
[32:47] you express it
[32:51] so i got to thinking about this and this
[32:54] and you know so ty i thought tonight
[32:56] maybe we talk about the state of
[32:58] missouri for just a little bit
[33:00] the state of missouri
[33:03] now
[33:03] and i got a new i got a couple new one
[33:05] things here i i thought i had a new
[33:07] little quote wrote down here but i've
[33:09] done i don't i just it's not right there
[33:11] where i want it to be so i just have to
[33:13] go with this one because i've got a
[33:15] another another
[33:17] nickname for
[33:18] the state of missouri i thought it was
[33:21] kansas
[33:23] uh siri said it was missouri so it's not
[33:25] kansas i'm not sure what can
[33:28] this but anyway missouri it has the
[33:31] nickname of
[33:32] uh to be the show me
[33:35] right the show me state
[33:37] another word for it is the mother of the
[33:39] west they called it another place escape
[33:41] state i call it the doubting thomas
[33:43] state
[33:46] all right
[33:48] i call it that that's the new thing i
[33:49] call the doubting thomas state yeah
[33:52] why
[33:54] because
[33:54] thomas
[33:56] he had to be shown didn't he
[33:58] he would not believe until you show me
[34:00] you know so the touting thomas state or
[34:03] the show me state
[34:04] you know if you have love we're going to
[34:06] find out if we really have love
[34:10] what it means to say i love god that's a
[34:12] pretty big statement or i'm a
[34:14] christian
[34:16] or i love you
[34:20] you know
[34:22] so
[34:23] kind of it kind of a message of
[34:26] the expression you've heard before of
[34:28] where the rubber meeting perhaps or
[34:31] the evidence of it you know it's it's
[34:33] where it work we can say a lot of things
[34:35] preacher can say a lot of things and
[34:37] tonight without the lord i'm gonna
[34:39] preach on the preacher a little bit okay
[34:41] i preach on y'all a lot maybe maybe not
[34:43] maybe i never hit you at all but
[34:48] gonna tonight i'm gonna
[34:49] i'm gonna i'm gonna hit myself with a
[34:51] little bit all right the preacher
[34:53] you know
[34:54] can i just say something
[35:01] it's better
[35:03] [Music]
[35:06] to live a sermon
[35:09] than it is
[35:11] for each one
[35:15] puts us on the spot don't
[35:17] that's right
[35:19] right
[35:21] but
[35:22] you know
[35:24] one thing about and i want to
[35:26] talk about god and his expressions first
[35:32] love actually does something about it
[35:35] important
[35:37] that i show you
[35:45] i mean as we come to church tonight to
[35:48] express what
[35:50] [Music]
[35:52] i mean as we're saved by grace not by
[35:54] works
[35:55] let me ask you what is our works
[36:02] by obeying god it is us
[36:05] expressing that
[36:07] to god the love
[36:10] that he shows us that's what works is
[36:13] in other words it is where he cared
[36:16] now the question is do you care
[36:18] his son on calvary
[36:20] [Music]
[36:21] when he said he loved he did it
[36:24] with outstretched hands
[36:27] he went to calvary because he loved
[36:32] me
[36:38] how many knows that um
[36:40] the predestinated are the only ones
[36:42] considered in redemption
[36:44] y'all remember that phrase
[36:46] in the message the predestinators are
[36:48] the only ones who knew those who
[36:51] would want and those who would not want
[36:56] and he predestinated those who he seen
[36:58] would want
[37:00] right
[37:02] and so when you think about it
[37:05] but i got to think about this this
[37:06] afternoon
[37:09] how that
[37:10] when god loved when he saw me before the
[37:13] foundation of the world and i make it
[37:14] personal
[37:18] god loved me
[37:20] all right
[37:21] god loved you
[37:24] and then what did he do for me
[37:27] he made this whole planet for me
[37:32] he expressed his love to me
[37:35] to me by creating the whole world
[37:39] now
[37:40] there's a word i left out on purpose
[37:43] because
[37:45] i want to make sure that we include more
[37:47] than just me right
[37:49] i left out the only
[37:52] he did not just love only me
[37:54] he loved others also right
[37:57] but
[37:58] think about it he's all
[38:00] out of you he thought of me
[38:02] and he loved me he loved you
[38:05] but that's why he made the first star
[38:07] the first move
[38:10] how many knows it did that's what god
[38:11] did it all for
[38:13] he did it all for you and for me
[38:16] for the ones that he loved
[38:20] he didn't do it for those that he didn't
[38:21] love him
[38:28] if he was going to end up with nobody
[38:30] with him in the first place why would he
[38:31] have ever done it
[38:33] he certainly isn't a god that doesn't
[38:35] end up with a
[38:36] prophet
[38:38] all right or or something comes out of
[38:40] it
[38:42] huh
[38:44] that's right
[38:45] but i thought that that's wonderful
[38:47] that should make us happy because we
[38:49] know that he did that for us
[38:52] don't you know the bible says the meek
[38:54] shall what
[38:56] scripture that says he made it for you
[38:59] he made it for the meek
[39:02] praise be to god tonight
[39:05] so everything he did was an expression
[39:08] of his love
[39:11] it was all an expression god expressing
[39:14] himself
[39:16] how many knows that when he said uh you
[39:18] know i'll send you elijah the prophet
[39:20] before the great and dead from there the
[39:22] lord and you know he'll
[39:24] you'll grow up
[39:26] as calves of the stalls and he'll come
[39:27] with healing in his wings
[39:30] how many knows when that happened in
[39:32] this generation
[39:34] and they'd had to take some
[39:36] my loads after
[39:38] semi loads of cots
[39:40] stretchers
[39:43] you know
[39:44] all these thousands of people were that
[39:46] was an expression of what he
[39:49] had thought an expression of what
[39:52] he had said
[39:58] you tonight are an expression of
[40:01] god
[40:04] we're an expression
[40:06] god expressing himself it's
[40:09] really the only thing that counts
[40:15] huh
[40:18] because even the prophet said look he
[40:19] said if there he said but god let there
[40:22] be
[40:26] he says but it was never light until it
[40:28] was what
[40:29] man it's really faith or not
[40:31] you really didn't have it
[40:33] you have to see them
[40:35] according to james
[40:37] 2
[40:39] and verse 14.
[40:42] can faith
[40:44] save him
[40:45] if that brother knew that you had a
[40:47] freezer full of food and you had mine in
[40:49] the bank and you didn't do anything
[40:50] about it
[40:56] you just
[40:57] you know he'd go that man's a liar
[41:00] he does not really have love
[41:03] i have no confidence in his prayer
[41:06] right
[41:08] but if person doesn't have the spirit to
[41:10] go with it then it really can't do
[41:13] anything
[41:16] right
[41:17] yeah a man might say thou hast and i
[41:19] have works faith by my work how many
[41:22] believes it's better to live a sermon
[41:25] than it is to preach one
[41:31] anyway i'll just say it
[41:33] so yeah abraham was
[41:36] righteous
[41:38] but how many knows that god eventually
[41:41] tested abraham on that faith
[41:43] that faith did get testif tested
[41:47] so that he could be fully expressed
[41:50] when he told his after he had a son
[41:52] huh
[41:53] after he believed it for 25 years he had
[41:55] a son
[41:57] gross son grew up maybe 15 16 years old
[42:01] and god said something he said it's
[42:03] wrong god would never tell you to go
[42:04] murder your son no
[42:08] but abraham knew that voice
[42:10] now right he didn't understand
[42:13] there was no logic to it no
[42:14] understanding of it it's just that god
[42:16] said it
[42:18] and he knew as brother bannon did when
[42:19] that angel tells him something and i
[42:21] know that's the angle telling me
[42:23] i know to listen when he tells me that
[42:26] and abraham knew it and he went up there
[42:28] and he absolutely so believed it that he
[42:31] had just expressed his faith in god by
[42:34] taking that dagger and he was fixing to
[42:36] stab him
[42:37] and just as he was fixing to stab him
[42:39] god said now i know
[42:41] that you believe me
[42:42] that you love me right
[42:46] he had to test it
[42:49] the quote i was looking for brother baby
[42:51] makes a statement he says what paul saw
[42:53] was what god saw in abraham and what
[42:57] james said about works and faith he says
[42:58] that's what man sees
[43:01] right
[43:02] that's right works god sees
[43:06] whether you really have faith or not
[43:09] then he knows whether he believe or not
[43:11] but what we do
[43:13] is what expresses to everybody what we
[43:15] really are whether we
[43:17] praise the lord
[43:21] i love the thought of expression
[43:24] because that's what we do that's what we
[43:27] live every day that's why we live the
[43:29] way we live
[43:31] is because we are expressing ourselves
[43:34] to god for what he has already done
[43:39] and i thought about something and i
[43:41] never could have put it in the
[43:43] proper words like i wanted to
[43:48] but let me just put it to you the way
[43:49] that i wrote it here and the way that i
[43:51] thought it and i hope you get it right
[43:54] it's
[43:55] like preaching or people living for god
[44:02] you know
[44:03] sometimes you come up here and you're
[44:05] preaching for god
[44:06] or we're living you're i'm living for
[44:09] god
[44:10] you know
[44:11] like you're trying to serve him like
[44:13] you're trying to do something for him
[44:16] but that's not correct
[44:18] even preaching for god
[44:20] isn't necessarily correct
[44:22] if it's something to get me now external
[44:25] that you're trying to do
[44:27] because when it's living for god it's
[44:29] not about living for god
[44:31] what it's really about is god living
[44:34] for you
[44:36] right
[44:37] it's god living here
[44:39] so that you don't have to live
[44:42] it's not you doing something it's god in
[44:44] you doing something
[44:47] just like preaching danny
[44:49] just like preaching sometimes you want
[44:51] to preach don't worry about preaching
[44:53] just let the preacher do the preaching
[44:55] let god preach
[44:58] let god speak
[45:00] like jesus said the words that i speak
[45:02] to you they're not my words they're god
[45:05] the father's words
[45:07] right he wasn't doing something for god
[45:08] but he was allowing it to come through
[45:10] him
[45:11] not something external i hope everybody
[45:13] understands that
[45:15] in the way that it's said
[45:17] if you'll notice even jesus when it
[45:19] comes to the rubber meeting the road or
[45:21] show me
[45:22] [Applause]
[45:24] or real expressions
[45:28] he said if
[45:30] you can't believe my words
[45:33] what did he say then
[45:34] believe my works
[45:37] right
[45:38] because they shouldn't believe these
[45:40] words
[45:42] but if they can't you gotta believe the
[45:44] works
[45:47] oh my
[45:50] listen
[45:51] says jesus said the works that i do bear
[45:52] witness
[45:54] of me
[45:56] right
[45:58] the things that i do what i say is what
[46:01] bears record of me
[46:02] and that's what bears record of every
[46:06] person
[46:08] by their fruits you shall know them
[46:10] not by what you say
[46:12] huh
[46:13] how many please it's not what i say it's
[46:15] not what you say
[46:16] it's what you do
[46:20] i've heard it said many times and i
[46:21] believe it's true that
[46:23] saying it
[46:24] is easy
[46:27] living it
[46:28] is a different story
[46:33] one one you want to know one let me tell
[46:35] you one
[46:36] love
[46:37] your enemies
[46:39] do good to them who say
[46:40] despitefully you can mistreat you and
[46:43] pray for them
[46:45] and those that curse you
[46:48] bless them
[46:50] huh
[46:52] can i say something
[46:53] that's really really hard
[46:58] and that's really really easy
[47:04] i'm sure we got a good class tonight who
[47:07] could tell me the difference what makes
[47:09] the difference
[47:12] that was quick
[47:14] that's right
[47:15] if you haven't got christ it's so hard
[47:18] so hard you have to impersonate and try
[47:20] and try and you just can't do it but if
[47:22] you've got god in there it's easy
[47:26] sure it is
[47:28] if it's truly christ in there it's easy
[47:31] now let me tell you something
[47:33] i've had to do this many times you've
[47:34] had to do this many times
[47:37] because you went through to where you
[47:39] was fighting you with yourself
[47:41] you had to battle and fight and it was
[47:43] harder and
[47:44] harder and all get out
[47:47] but once you learned and committed to
[47:49] god oh wow
[47:52] man that wasn't so hard just all you had
[47:54] to do is give it to god
[47:55] [Music]
[47:56] he'll take care of it
[47:57] you have you know all the bitterness
[47:59] goes away all the hurt all the pain all
[48:01] the all that begins to just heal away
[48:03] and you can actually pray for the person
[48:05] god bless that person
[48:12] i've had thoughts then i've had thoughts
[48:14] coming to my mind saying
[48:16] definitely going to burn in hell
[48:23] i got everybody's thinking now don't we
[48:25] that person's definitely gonna burn it
[48:27] out man they've done everything wicked
[48:28] under the sun
[48:31] but then immediately the holy spirit
[48:33] says yeah but you wouldn't want anybody
[48:35] to go to hell
[48:37] god
[48:38] if at all possible save that person have
[48:41] mercy that's what i prayed don't have
[48:43] mercy on that person
[48:45] i don't want to see him lost
[48:47] it wasn't hard
[48:48] but the carnal mind
[48:50] thinks oh a person you know they deserve
[48:52] to go to no that's what he'll think but
[48:54] let the holy ghost think
[48:56] you have compassion
[48:58] no you don't wish anybody to hell that's
[49:00] even what the prophet said isn't that
[49:01] right
[49:02] you don't wish anybody to go there
[49:05] amen
[49:07] that's right then he says do you know
[49:09] i'd rather you'd live me a sermon than
[49:11] to preach me one it's much better
[49:15] it speaks louder a lived sermon is
[49:18] really loud
[49:20] how many believe that we need thousands
[49:22] of lived sermons
[49:27] lived sermons the prophet said that's
[49:29] what we need
[49:30] thundering out because it's
[49:33] you know because whether you know it or
[49:34] not how many knows that if you're a
[49:36] christian
[49:39] or even not
[49:41] you are a written epistle
[49:43] known as red of all men whether good or
[49:45] bad
[49:46] right
[49:50] i was
[49:51] searching a certain quote up and i came
[49:53] across where brother banham
[49:55] i believe he was in expressions when he
[49:56] was no i don't know that it wasn't there
[49:59] but
[50:00] he was talking about how when you go to
[50:01] preach at a funeral
[50:03] he said sometimes that person maybe has
[50:05] lived a terrible terrible terrible life
[50:07] and he was just not good at all but when
[50:10] it comes to preaching his feeling all of
[50:11] a sudden the man becomes good and that
[50:13] woman becomes good and oh they're going
[50:14] to be in heaven and everything else you
[50:16] can preach all of that
[50:22] and he says but you know what doesn't
[50:23] matter what you say
[50:25] he says put it this way he says those
[50:27] folks have already made up their mind
[50:31] they already know what that person was
[50:33] like so you're not going to convince
[50:34] them any different
[50:37] why because they're loud they're
[50:39] their life spoke so loud
[50:41] it drowned out their words
[50:45] amen
[50:46] you love him
[50:49] that's right
[50:52] was not abraham our father justified by
[50:54] works when he had offered up fact of
[50:57] isaac his son upon the altar seeing
[51:00] thou how faith wrought with his works
[51:03] and by works his faith was made perfect
[51:07] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[51:08] said abraham believed god and it was
[51:10] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[51:12] he was called to god
[51:14] see ye then how that by works in man is
[51:16] justified and not by faith only
[51:20] and rahab also
[51:22] the harlot being justified by works when
[51:25] she had
[51:26] received the messengers and had sent
[51:28] them out another way
[51:30] for as the body without the spirit is
[51:33] dead so
[51:34] is faith without works is dead also
[51:39] so if we say we have faith but we don't
[51:40] have the works to go to it
[51:42] it means what zero
[51:45] means nothing
[51:46] how many blades do works have to be
[51:48] there to go with it show me
[51:54] right there's
[51:56] your missouri show me
[51:58] there's your thomas show me
[52:01] how many because that's what we got to
[52:02] do each and every one of us that's our
[52:05] job
[52:06] is to show people
[52:07] people
[52:09] we show each other
[52:12] we express
[52:14] to each other
[52:16] down
[52:16] here you say that you love me
[52:20] but i will all
[52:22] only know
[52:24] when you show it in action
[52:30] amen
[52:35] talk about words
[52:38] words come easy
[52:40] words are easy
[52:43] but when it comes to doing it
[52:47] then you better have
[52:48] the goods
[52:50] you say you love god
[52:52] you say love with not one another how
[52:54] many knows that was the one great
[52:55] commandment
[52:56] is that we love one another
[52:59] love one another a new commandment i
[53:01] give you love one another
[53:04] let's talk about doers
[53:07] ye
[53:08] doers of the word and not hearers only
[53:12] deceiving your own selves
[53:14] if any man be a hearer of the word and
[53:16] not a doer he is like a man be holding
[53:18] his face in a natural glass
[53:20] for he beholdeth himself and goeth his
[53:22] way and straightway forgiveth what
[53:24] manner of man he was
[53:26] but whosoever looketh upon the into the
[53:28] perfect law of liberty and continued
[53:30] therian he being not a forgetful hearer
[53:34] but a doer of the word
[53:36] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[53:40] amen
[53:43] let me ask you this
[53:45] action
[53:48] expression
[53:50] the golden rule is is that we love one
[53:52] another
[53:53] and the golden rule says what
[53:57] but what's the first word
[53:59] of the golden rule
[54:06] did you say something sisters on these
[54:08] go ahead if it's wrong it's okay
[54:12] exactly what i would think
[54:14] do unto others

[54:21] do didn't say love didn't say anything
[54:23] else but do

[54:31] come from i remember my mom
[54:34] and different ones if we go back home
[54:36] and say why don't the amish ever tell

[55:51] all the time maybe they love each other
[55:53] but did they stick together
[55:56] no

[59:11] i'll
[59:12] say thank you jesus
[59:16] thank you jesus
[59:18] amen
[59:20] praise the lord
[59:21] that's better god likes that
[59:24] all right shall we go on
[59:26] so we see here jesus
[59:28] amen he says uh
[59:31] let's let's just take uh we're gonna let
[59:33] you out early tonight
[59:34] but anyway let's go to saint john let's
[59:36] let's see what it means
[59:38] when you say i love god
[59:41] what does that mean
[59:43] how do you know for sure
[59:45] if a person loves god
[59:48] well it's found in saint john 14
[59:51] and also first john the scripture we're
[59:53] from we're very familiar with but i want
[59:55] to go over it again is that okay
[59:59] i love jesus i love god
[1:00:02] everything we do let me tell you
[1:00:04] something
[1:00:05] everything we do should express our love
[1:00:09] for god
[1:00:14] but i'll tell you what jesus said
[1:00:17] that you
[1:00:19] and jesus
[1:00:21] answered and
[1:00:23] said unto him
[1:00:24] if a man loved
[1:00:26] me he will keep my words
[1:00:30] and my father will love him and we will
[1:00:33] come unto him and make our abode with
[1:00:36] him
[1:00:39] and he that loveth me not
[1:00:43] keepeth not
[1:00:45] my sayings
[1:00:48] and the word which you hear is not mine
[1:00:50] but the father's
[1:00:51] which has sent me
[1:00:54] so jesus clearly another place saint
[1:00:56] john 14 around 12 13 14 there
[1:01:01] if you love me he said
[1:01:03] keep my
[1:01:05] commandments
[1:01:08] huh see how he's saying the way that
[1:01:10] you're going to express
[1:01:12] your love for god
[1:01:14] is by keeping his commandments
[1:01:17] and we all know what it's like
[1:01:19] whether it's on yourself that you see
[1:01:21] that you aren't doing what the word says
[1:01:23] or when you see somebody else
[1:01:26] amen that is not doing what the bible
[1:01:29] says
[1:01:30] all you can do is pray for that person
[1:01:32] to fall more in love with god and i
[1:01:34] guarantee you those things will fall off
[1:01:39] because if we don't love god the way
[1:01:40] that we should
[1:01:42] for one thing
[1:01:43] we're going to miss a lot of church
[1:01:46] don't really care about being there
[1:01:49] because if you love god
[1:01:51] you got the holy ghost what did the
[1:01:52] father god say you can't wait for them
[1:01:54] doors to open
[1:01:56] amen
[1:01:58] sure
[1:02:04] so when you never see people in church
[1:02:07] there's something seriously wrong with
[1:02:09] their love for god
[1:02:14] let me tell you something that's not
[1:02:16] just god
[1:02:17] because the prophet said and to
[1:02:19] fellowship with
[1:02:21] your brothers and sisters
[1:02:23] the love of god will make you want to go
[1:02:25] and fellowship with your brothers and
[1:02:26] sisters
[1:02:27] it'll make you want to shake somebody's
[1:02:29] hand and say how are you doing it you
[1:02:30] know
[1:02:31] but if you get away from god you don't
[1:02:33] really want to get around the crowd you
[1:02:34] don't want to get around that bunch
[1:02:36] that's always got a smile in their face
[1:02:38] because you ain't got to smile
[1:02:40] huh you know i get all around all these
[1:02:42] happy people you know and you just want
[1:02:44] to kind of hibernate go into some little
[1:02:46] hole somewhere and
[1:02:48] you know not have to deal with all the
[1:02:50] people's feelings and oh they didn't do
[1:02:52] this and they didn't you'll deal with
[1:02:54] all of that if you've got the holy ghost
[1:02:55] you can realize that's how human beings
[1:02:57] are
[1:02:59] you'll be able to overlook
[1:03:05] ah i don't want to go back into my
[1:03:07] counseling sessions but one time i asked
[1:03:09] somebody in counseling he says what's
[1:03:10] wrong
[1:03:12] what's wrong
[1:03:14] he said oh there's a big list
[1:03:17] there's a big list
[1:03:24] if i get into it
[1:03:25] i'm like wow that's he's holding a lot
[1:03:28] of stuff
[1:03:30] what that told me is he's holding a lot
[1:03:32] of things
[1:03:34] and my bible tells me that the holy
[1:03:36] ghost don't hold no accounts
[1:03:39] no accounts it's all gone all forgiven
[1:03:42] when you hold that many things in there
[1:03:44] you know there's some torment going on
[1:03:45] up in there
[1:03:48] didn't even want to get straightened out
[1:03:49] didn't they want to talk about
[1:03:51] huh
[1:03:52] too much to deal with already
[1:03:54] somebody needs to get to the altar
[1:03:57] because love don't hold account
[1:04:04] amen
[1:04:08] praise god you love him
[1:04:11] and last scripture tonight is first john
[1:04:14] 1
[1:04:16] in verse 3
[1:04:19] hereby
[1:04:20] we know
[1:04:22] that somebody knows him i'm gonna put it
[1:04:24] in a little different words is that okay
[1:04:27] this is how you know you know him this
[1:04:29] is how you know somebody else knows him
[1:04:31] if we
[1:04:32] keep his commandments
[1:04:35] there's that do word again
[1:04:38] isn't that right
[1:04:39] do something how many knows you got to
[1:04:40] keep his commandments something you got
[1:04:42] to do
[1:04:44] in other words if you're going to truly
[1:04:45] express your love for god it takes an
[1:04:49] action
[1:04:51] it takes something that you
[1:04:53] do not just something that you hear
[1:04:55] that's just something that we preach
[1:04:57] but it's an action
[1:05:00] keep his commandments
[1:05:01] for he that said oh i know god praise be
[1:05:04] to god
[1:05:06] and keepeth not his commandments is a
[1:05:08] liar
[1:05:09] and the truth is not in him
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:16] what if we had
[1:05:17] maybe a woman up here with short hair
[1:05:20] wearing pants and makeup like tammy
[1:05:23] baker or somebody don't like mention
[1:05:24] names but we know how it was just caked
[1:05:27] on until they were somebody else don't
[1:05:28] know for sure who they are
[1:05:30] come on folks
[1:05:32] singing
[1:05:34] amazing grace like an angel
[1:05:40] huh
[1:05:42] what would it do to you
[1:05:44] kind of turn your stomach a little maybe
[1:05:51] yeah
[1:05:52] it would make you sick because it
[1:05:53] certainly makes god sick
[1:05:56] because every action says no she don't
[1:05:59] she doesn't know grace
[1:06:01] person no grace
[1:06:04] amen when i thought about this message
[1:06:07] all i want to say is lord help me
[1:06:11] that my expressions
[1:06:14] are all christ
[1:06:15] i want him living him is him living out
[1:06:19] through me
[1:06:20] that's what i want
[1:06:22] then i'll be able to do everything that
[1:06:24] he said
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:28] let me just say this
[1:06:31] for those of us who aren't quite perfect
[1:06:33] yet
[1:06:35] all right
[1:06:37] you may not you may know things that
[1:06:39] you're not doing that's according to the
[1:06:41] word but yet you want to serve them with
[1:06:43] all your heart
[1:06:44] that's the attitude you should have you
[1:06:46] got to have
[1:06:47] we all got to have the attitude lord i
[1:06:49] see this in my life take it out i see
[1:06:51] that in my life take it out i want to do
[1:06:53] everything that she said
[1:06:55] i'm going to live by every word of god
[1:06:57] that proceeds every word that proceedeth
[1:06:59] out of the mouth of god
[1:07:00] if you've got that attitude you're going
[1:07:02] in the right direction
[1:07:05] amen
[1:07:06] because none of us is perfect i doubt
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:12] if there be one fault oh man i could
[1:07:15] probably mention many
[1:07:16] it's that we're not on fire like we
[1:07:18] should be
[1:07:19] we're not trying to get the sinners like
[1:07:20] we should
[1:07:22] we don't have enough of the love of god
[1:07:23] in us hardly to tell
[1:07:25] you know
[1:07:27] there's people that i know you know and
[1:07:29] and you have to follow the holy spirit
[1:07:31] when it comes to witnessing the people
[1:07:32] but there's people that i've never
[1:07:34] witnessed to that i should have that i
[1:07:35] associated with they knew i was a
[1:07:36] christian a preacher and talked about
[1:07:38] the lord maybe but i didn't go into the
[1:07:40] depth that i'd like to you know
[1:07:42] i just want to
[1:07:44] live closer to him don't you
[1:07:46] and express

[1:08:15] that you wear
[1:08:16] he supplies for stuff and things for us
