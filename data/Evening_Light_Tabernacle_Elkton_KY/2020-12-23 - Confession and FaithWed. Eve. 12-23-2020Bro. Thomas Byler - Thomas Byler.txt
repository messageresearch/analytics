there he had a right to amen so now notice and i said now lady i've done all i can do well let me see this here so it's just you have to tell your husband if you ever if you're ever going to get well my point is we have to confess we have to see where we're wrong thomas has to see where he's wrong now i can't do it it'll i can't do it she says i didn't break up my home she says i've got three little children my husband would leave me huh i said now lady i've done all i can do i said you know there isn't a psychiatrist in the world could pull that out for you that's way back in the gable end of your soul way back in your subconscious you wiped it out oh man listen i'm convinced that people that wrong absolutely put put it in for let me just say this time when we're wrong we always want to blame somebody else no it's not my fault it's his fault huh no you're hiding you're putting it way up in the gable end of your soul huh or trying to put it off you know you know the saying whatever makes you feel better what else whatever helps you sleep at night that's what people do people do that stuff to try to help them sleep that night rather than face the real truth huh is this all right for our wednesday night so y'all smile so it must be all right amen so way down in your the gable end of your soul is where this was hit at you subconsciously think of it till you got yourself in that condition i said that's the whole thing now there's the truth and you know it's the truth there's no other person in the world but you that man and me that knows this now and she says that's right but said i couldn't make that right that says well now that's all i can do said oh you're going to leave but bannon had somebody else he had it was attending to and didn't have time to sit there and play games either make it right i've done all i can do lady so he says i said yes ma'am there's a man sitting in this room which is this man here and i said he's very seriously you know fevered up there this morning i said i've got to go get go in there's some more people come coming and she said oh i can't said what must i do and i said go call your husband and make it right get right to get that thing cleaned out that's the only way to do it and she said well she said i just can't do it she says oh i'll die just started like that and i happened to look around and i seen something foam on the side of her inside of her and i looked and there she man black hit it combed his head over kind of sideways kind of wavy a little older she was than she was i said is your husband black-headed man yes sir kind of tall yes sir isn't he deacon in the church yes sir i said he works at a chevrolet company doesn't he yes sir i said he's got the same thing to confess to you amen when he landed in france and he taken the girl and so forth and we won't go into details but he did the same thing that she did he's guilty of the same thing not my husband i says well you better get things right you better call him up so media media not media media got to talking to her and persuaded her to do it she went and called her husband they got in the car and met on the road she got in the car she's now i want to tell you and she confessed it all to him amen and he was looking at her and says now didn't you said didn't you go out with this woman the officer wound there about three days ago before there before that and you was in a green chevrolet car and she was wearing pink said how do you know that where you been and so she told her where he had been he says honey that's the truth now i will admit that's the truth and if you forgive me i'll forgive you and maria will raise our children and start life right amen in a few minutes there they came back up the steps tears streaming down their cheeks oh satan had lost his hold then now that's where it's at amen but as long as sin is under there no matter how loud you scream how hard you jump how much oil you pour or how loud or you pray or how quietly you pray whatever you do the devil will stay right there as long as you've got unconfessed sin that's exactly right amen so you see folks that's my main message tonight is lord help us to look down in our hearts because how many knows all of us especially remember the one time brother bam uh this one little girl i believe she was nervous and brilliant went back down in their life way by this as a child a dog chased her y'all remember the sword dog chaser and it caused her always to be fearful i think that's a good lesson for us as parents that you know when you go boo and scare them you know you're you're you're forming them little kids maybe if we taught them to hey don't be afraid of the darkness nothing there it is out of the other which i know they'll have a natural tendency in that right to be scared of the dark because when you make it worse right all those things that right but you know just look at this every one of us not just that but every situation every circumstance everything that we go through has a tendency to form us to make us what we are amen and i will tell you what i i know that it can definitely cause us to what have complexes is that right it can cause us to have bitterness people sometimes you know uh you know things happen to where they become bitter and they might say they forgive huh but how many knows if you don't confess now actually you come to the place he says no i still got bitterness against that sister i still got bitterness against that brother amen and things will happen sometimes that'll bring that right up and it'll show you how many knows we need that that's why we need god to create situations to find out whether that thing is still down in there or not because if there's i'll guarantee you this if there jesus said you know if you don't forgive people their trespasses neither will your heaven oh if you're not forgiven then you've got a devil in your heart people is unforgiven sometimes we're not forgiven amen you know what i like about one thing about i love about jesus in john 3 16 you know he did not come to condemn the world he didn't just come to condemn everybody no he did not come to the condemned of the world but that the world through him might be saved amen and sometimes listen sometimes you know we get to where we just want to condemn everybody if you got a spirit that just wants to condemn everybody you remember that is not the holy ghost it's not the right spirit it's not the right attitude read you another story i said i had to let me read you another story or i'll tell you pretty much tell you the story but i do want to perhaps read a little bit out of it if i can here y'all remember the story of brother branham in ohio i believe it was and he was holding meetings he was preaching holding services right and he went over to this place because another restaurant was closed and so he went into what it looks to me like almost a bar and that right women drinking playing the stockish but that's a weird place for the prophet to land up isn't that right because i remember the machines you pushed the disc out of the other and the rock and roll it was all going on but he went in there and mr holy prophet isn't that right he's seen an old woman over there seeing the policeman breaking the law playing slot machines and gambling and everything else and oh he got to where he says you know why god why don't you just wipe that whole thing out huh wipe it all out what did god do he said come here son he took him behind and over there and he showed him all his sins showed him all he did and everything he had you know he talks about it being in talit ohio and brother bam says god showed me all that he showed me that in my heart it wasn't right amen let me tell you something it's real easy for our heart not to be right if we aren't careful we'll get in god's way amen you know if you want to find out whether somebody's really got the holy ghost or not sometimes you stroke them backwards a little bit like balaban did that kitty kitty did somebody do you wrong to find out how your reaction is amen let somebody smite you on the cheek huh we'll find out if there's any fight in yet just let these things happen and we kind of find out where you're at but brother branham here in this restaurant he was just really wanting to condemn the whole world and god told him he wrote all of his sins and it was all pardoned so brother bam says this you know god showed me that in my heart i wasn't right amen because i was trying to condemn her and not looking at what i had come from so we can always remember look back at the pit where we was hewn from amen things will look a lot different then see sometimes we get critical of people amen they call themselves christians but yet they're not doing like the oddity huh they still got faults they still got failures let me tell you this if you just condemn those folks all you got to do is look back a little bit and realize hey you know what i claimed the name of christianity and look at what i did now it doesn't the bible says judge not that you be not judged condemn not that you be not condemned because when you go to jump and you're going to condemn and everybody all they did that god could turn right around and he could point you to your fault and if he does you'll go to hell because you just condemned everybody else they'll you're bound to land in hell if that's your attitude that's why jesus said judge not don't be judgmental don't be condemning do you have a spirit of forgiveness hey i'm praying for you i'm believing for that person even brother branham when it comes to naming names on the pulpit one time he did come back and says i apologize i shouldn't have named the name why he was that sensitive about not naming names and condemning people amen but he was a prophet of god he didn't know what he was talking about amen let me tell you something else you know brother brahm said you know we can be right and have the wrong spirit what does that mean that means you're wrong you can be wrong and have the right spirit what does that mean you'll stand up and be right so let me ask you this we as christians we as who have been believers for a long time how many in here i have i've detected it in myself i've learned to know that hey i got the wrong attitude i need the holy spirit to take over here that right and every christian has to come to that place in their life to where you know that if you have the right spirit or whether you have the wrong spirit because the holy ghost is easily to being treated it's gentle huh even jesus when he looked at the woman at the well amen and caught in the very act and man she was absolutely guilty but yet what did he say to her where's your where's your condemors where's those that accuse you and she said i don't have any they're all gone and jesus says neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more amen even in a situation to where it really was true she was absolutely caught in the act she deserved to die but jesus was not in the condemning mood we're not in a dispensation of condemned condemnation sometimes the lord will give us insight on what we see well this person is definitely not this saturday they ain't gonna make it to heaven let me tell you what let me tell you what your prophet taught your prophet taught you taught me that people are going to be there you don't think are going to be there all right he taught us that we are going to be people not there that we thought was going to be there so watch out that's up to god i believe that's up to god to do the judging in those areas hey i think about perhaps my worst enemy but i am hoping that when i get over there they'll be there i want to see them there because i know how much god's grace is to me and i want god's grace to them i'm not the i'm not god i don't judge whether you know they're not going to be forgiven or forgiven and i can thankfully say i confess this evening by god's grace that's the way i feel i don't i don't hold anything against anybody because if i do if i hold one thing against anybody there will be something in there that'll make me act and react wrong and it won't be the holy ghost it'll be a devil because of that little bitterness or whatever it might be amen i hope this is helping all of us praise the lord so now what does the prophet of god say he says look at where you come from so we can always remember look back at the pit that we were hewn from look at where we come from then things will look a lot different brother baby says we don't want to condemn no one love everybody whenever you lose that real genuine love that's in your heart you have lost everything how many of us got to have genuine love in our hearts whenever you lose real genuine life touching you lost everything just don't forget that when you lose your when you lose love it's all gone amen how many believe that that's true remember and this is a this i say this faith and confession because it doesn't matter how much faith you have how much you pray how much an oil you do and how many whatever you do as long as there's something down inside of you that shouldn't be there it'll never do any good will it you will never be able to change i don't know about you but that's a scary thought to think that you can't change but you just stay the same year after year after year after year after year then i don't know about you but i see god what is it what is it in my heart that's keeping me from changing from being what i'm supposed to be do i have something in my heart how many want to ask the lord that lord is there something in my heart shouldn't be there then guess what something's going to happen to show you whether you got it in there or not something's going to happen and when you finally realize if you finally that's a great part of this once you realize when the grace of god shows you because my wife she'll tell you too that you know in our past and things you know that unless it's truly god bringing a revelation in your heart about it you're not gonna get it you're not gonna get it unless it's a personal revelation from god to you amen and that's why we have to say holy spirit come down in the gable end of my soul because a lot of us i don't care who you are if you lived in this world very long you've had differences with people you've had you've had uh things that you had hard to overcome amen and if thomas bowler isn't careful if you aren't careful that thing will stick down in there and it'll affect your life and it'll deform your personality in other words it won't be the image of christ it'll still be you in god's way amen because i don't know about you but my heart's ambition my goal is for the holy spirit to have such free reign in our church amen free reign in our church that god can do just what he did in the book of acts how many is with me just what he did in the book of acts because we either got it or we don't got it folks amen and i want us all to have it i want to have it in a greater way those streaming think about it huh i don't care what it is if it's clothes you ought to be wearing the holy spirit will tell you huh if it's an attitude you have it's a boss hearts his workers or whatever not doing right or work retards about the holy spirit will tell you amen that's what we need we need the holy spirit to go down into the gable end of our souls and find out why we are the way we are most of all why we stay the way we are why do i stay the way i am huh and i thank god for his grace because i'll tell you what if god wouldn't forgive you for the sins of today or tomorrow none of us would make it no even brother bannon he knew that he still had faults he had failures it's only the grace of god that keeps us and i truly believe that we're only we only stay clean by confession confession is to admit and how many knows it's just like whosoever confesses with his mouth the lord jesus christ they shall be saved now brother brahm said this message is christ isn't that right think about where people will be who are ashamed to confess this message in this hour to admit hey i believe that that was a prophet i believe that it was christ and when they do that they get marked as a holy ruler as a man follower or whatever it might be but if you don't confess the lord jesus christ with your mouth what does the bible say on that day i'll be ashamed of you man it's about confession so i don't know about you but i say lord jesus here how many would say hey daily god does show me things in my life he shows me where i'm not what i'd ought to be amen and i thank god for his goodness that leads us to repentance that woman can thank god in that right that the prophet of god discerned where her problem was there was a demon in there that caused her to go crazy drive you nuts torment you because how many knows the holy spirit he gives you peace he gives you assurance it gives you faith that when you've confessed everything everything is right in your heart the devil cannot come down in there there's no place for him to come down there and torment you and then it says the very scripture that whatsoever things we ask we receive of him because our heart don't condemn us amen in this case this woman thought hey you know how many times she came up to the altar and was prayed for and believed i believe i believe i believe but no there was something down in there that was still wrong amen now i don't know every one of us we you know you live your own life but every one of us know where you live at you know whether there's still something down there that's not right huh and then you wonder why god don't answer prayer um let me just say this in closing something the prophet said you know when he was telling about the man right here is your husband the black-headed man she said yes sir kind of tall and so forth on down i said he has the same thing to confess to you all right and then brother brennan makes the statement he says no wonder brother johnson can't have a revival amen how many knows if you he with that and there's a deacon in the church and here he had that sin in his heart and that right unconfessed i made right here was a woman probably a sunday school teacher or whatever the spirit just can't move when our heart isn't right with god amen and i'll tell you this this is what the lord laid on my heart so i trust that it'll be that it was a blessing to all of you but i know the lord speaks to me lord show me if i can't see it lord go way down in the gable end of my soul father and bring it out because i want to be ready when you come because you're going to come one of these days and your little star has appeared again so i'm looking for him to come aren't you how many wants to be ready let's stand musicians if you'll come bower heads both here and on streaming i'm just giving you a minute to search your heart to dig way down somewhere in the past maybe eight years ago maybe 20 years ago 30 years ago people are affected and sometimes it lasts their whole life because they never really opened up their heart say god i never really did get over that i never really let go of that i never really cut loose i never really just brought that out and emptied myself out so that you could come and fill me up there's anybody in here this evening with all eyes closed in mind including you just want to say raise your hand and say god there's i want to make sure that there's nothing anywhere in my life that would hinder the moving of the holy spirit that would cause you not to be able to work through my life somewhere where i'm still in the way of you really living out your life the way that you want to live so that as the song says i want to have the compassion i want to have the love i want to have the forgiveness i want to have the grace i want to have the mercy i want to have everything that jesus had that's what i want to have that's what i want to be lord jesus i believe this congregation here tonight and both here in the streaming world i believe there's people out there that would say and raise your hand say god that's what i want lord lord if there's something down in my heart if there if i can't change lord jesus i ask god if i can't overcome this what is it that's keeping me from overcoming this what's keeping me from having the peace that passes understanding the joy unspeakable and full of glory that when i'm out there by myself it's just a fullness of joy you feel like screaming down through the woods or wherever it is or as the prophet that day did run around the tree just shouting god that's how we want to be we want to be completely free we want to be completely cut loose of ourself father i pray tonight we give you permission to come into our hearts and show us where we are still too much alive where we are still in your way god show us because we cannot go on lord jesus with ourselves being in the way we want the holy spirit to have the complete preeminence in our hearts in our lives lord jesus oh my just one thing lord we think of and how that sometimes the devil robs us of our time to where we don't have time to get away with you and to pray like we should to get alone and let you come with your spotlight the sweetness of the spirit to come down and show us our bad places where we're not what we ought to be well we're not reaching out to the neighbors we're not reaching out to whoever we can father to try to be the light of the world and to have the love of god burning in our souls to have long suffering meekness gentleness patience and all these things like we should but father you know all of our hearts we ask god that you look down now and bring your spirit down in there lord and father if there's anybody in here that needs to confess to you lord before they go to bed may they say god i confess this to you and make it right if they say anything that they've done to anybody or whatever it might be maybe go to them and say i confess lord jesus and to that person say forgive me for this forgive me for that whatever it might be we want our hearts right with you lord we want no hidden demons in our life we don't want the devil to have one right to stay there in any of our lives we ask god that you just bless with a clean heart for each and every one here tonight get us ready for a book of acts get us ready for a revival or jesus and we pray that you'll bring one just stir us up like never before lord because we know that you can't we just have to get out of the way so that you can lord we love you tonight we commit this service to you now in the name of our lovely lord and savior jesus christ amen and amen god bless you brother david amen change my heart oh god change my heart oh god
