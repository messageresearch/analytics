[23:50] tommy's going for us okay all right
[23:52] praise the lord
[24:05] how y'all doing
[24:08] uh i was gonna read this thing uh
[24:11] i had bought a few little tracks off the
[24:13] voice of god
[24:15] i'm gonna try to share a few things i
[24:17] got some variety packs and uh
[24:20] i was reading this one this is the
[24:21] mystery of god revealed and you know
[24:23] they have like three testimonies in here
[24:26] of uh people being healed and stuff and
[24:28] i just thought this was really awesome
[24:30] out of the out of the three that they
[24:31] put on there and this one says tris
[24:33] griffin went to the doctor's office in
[24:36] early 2013 because of back pain that she
[24:39] feared could be reoccurrence of her
[24:42] battle with cancer
[24:43] mri showed an aorta of dissection in her
[24:46] heart and the doctors alleged further
[24:48] tests and scheduled an emergency surgery
[24:50] the next day
[24:52] the line thought the heart through the
[24:54] heart
[24:55] in the image in the in the obvious issue
[24:59] that would mean a quick and almost
[25:01] certain death if it ruptured shows a
[25:03] picture here
[25:05] if y'all remember that's the same thing
[25:06] that happened to me
[25:08] and it says in the next day after
[25:10] believers pray for her and the doctors
[25:12] conducted another ct scan
[25:14] to pinpoint the location of the
[25:17] the
[25:18] dissection before surgery this time the
[25:21] images showed a complete heel
[25:23] completely held
[25:25] the heart baffled the surgeon told miss
[25:27] griffin i don't know what to tell you
[25:30] you hadn't ordered this section but now
[25:32] that all evidence is gone
[25:34] he showed her images before prayer and
[25:36] then after you're free to go and by the
[25:39] way there's no sign of cancer either
[25:41] you're perfectly healthy
[25:43] i thought that was awesome man
[25:48] yeah
[25:50] praise the lord man i i was getting into
[25:52] that i was telling brother tom i said
[25:53] i'd kind of been on my heart but i was
[25:55] going to tell y'all too that uh
[25:57] if there's any uh body that want to go
[26:00] out and do any witnessing or something
[26:01] with me that
[26:02] uh you know i was seeing these guys you
[26:05] know denominational people going out
[26:06] doing outreaches and stuff you know and
[26:09] you know we just want to get them to god
[26:10] get them to christ you know and
[26:12] uh
[26:13] so i was buying some tracks up and
[26:15] different stuff and if anybody has it on
[26:17] their heart just get in touch with me
[26:18] and we can try to do something you know
[26:20] but uh they say you can't keep what you
[26:22] got unless you give it away and so
[26:25] the more god gives us i felt like you
[26:27] know i'm seeing these guys do things you
[26:29] know i've seen some baptist ministers
[26:31] going out and just doing some outreach
[26:33] and stuff and it's just like we see them
[26:35] do that you know we're the bride of
[26:36] christ you know we should be held to a
[26:38] higher standard we can get try to give
[26:40] something away and go help and get back
[26:42] but
[26:43] anyway
[26:44] uh
[26:46] if you want to turn the
[26:48] i didn't tell you to afford to go yet
[26:50] john 3
[27:02] john 3 10 through 21.
[27:17] jesus answered and said unto him art
[27:19] thou master of israel and know us not
[27:21] these things
[27:32] i've told you earthly things and you
[27:34] believe not how shall you believe if i
[27:36] tell you of heavenly things
[27:47] and as moses lifted up the serpent in
[27:50] the wilderness even so must the son of
[27:52] man be lifted up
[27:59] for god so loved the world that he gave
[28:01] his only begotten son that whosoever
[28:03] shall believe in him should not perish
[28:04] but have everlasting life
[28:14] he that believeth on him is not
[28:16] condemned but he that believeth not is
[28:18] condemned already because he hath not
[28:20] believed in the name of the only
[28:22] begotten son of god
[28:34] for everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[28:36] light neither cometh through the light
[28:38] unless his deeds should be reproved
[28:40] but he that doeth
[28:42] truth cometh to the light and his deeds
[28:46] may be made manifest they are wrong
[28:50] praise god
[29:03] you know brothers and sisters when you
[29:05] come up here there's a big difference
[29:07] between sitting there
[29:08] and coming up behind the pulpit
[29:12] for daniel and for all of you i'm
[29:14] it's it changes as soon as you come up
[29:16] the steps and
[29:18] have to speak to the people whether it's
[29:20] out of the word of god whether it's a
[29:22] testimony whether you're preaching
[29:24] whether you teach the matter what it is
[29:25] there's a transition from the minute you
[29:27] come up the steps
[29:29] until you open god's word and try to
[29:30] speak to the people
[29:33] you know your
[29:34] natural bodies
[29:35] once is nervous but once you yield to
[29:38] god you know everything's possible you
[29:40] know you can't you can't let yourself be
[29:43] defeated yeah you know i can remember
[29:46] what was it like 19 i think it was like
[29:49] 1993 1992
[29:52] when i first started teaching sunday
[29:54] school you know that was an uh you know
[29:56] when you like i said
[29:58] everything's
[30:00] everything's easy until you're
[30:02] accountable for the things you say to
[30:04] people in a spiritual sense it
[30:08] shouldn't be no fear there but it gives
[30:10] a sense of responsibility that you're
[30:12] responsible for what you tell people and
[30:14] what you say to them whether you're
[30:16] witnessing to them or whether you come
[30:18] up here and speak to them everything we
[30:20] want to do
[30:21] is out of love you know i was thinking
[30:23] to what brother tommy was talking about
[30:26] what thomas was saying or even last
[30:28] wednesday you know there's two things
[30:30] that bring you here this morning either
[30:32] duty or love
[30:34] there's just two things that make you
[30:35] come to church this morning either duty
[30:37] or love if it's duty
[30:39] then it's a grind and you don't do it
[30:41] out of love it's just a struggle you do
[30:43] it every day it's a struggle you don't
[30:45] have no victory you don't have no love
[30:47] or you come here because you love god
[30:49] and you just give everything that you
[30:50] are
[30:51] to him and that makes all the difference
[30:53] in who we are as individuals this
[30:55] morning
[30:56] i you know i i can i know i say it a lot
[30:58] but it's true
[31:00] i can only speak for myself and my own
[31:02] family and then as brother thomas the
[31:05] pastor he speaks for all of us through
[31:07] christ but
[31:09] in in the responsibility that it gives
[31:11] us as christians this morning
[31:13] i was reading this this morning but if
[31:15] you turn with me
[31:16] i'm totally
[31:18] not where i should be but if you return
[31:20] with me to uh
[31:22] hebrews the 13th chapter
[31:29] it's not a long chapter but i mean
[31:31] there's a lot of truth in it this
[31:33] morning
[31:34] for all of us to
[31:35] glean as christians and as believers
[31:38] this morning
[31:43] i don't know if i'm going to read this
[31:44] whole chapter or if i do i apologize
[31:46] before i get started
[31:48] but you know this is paul and again you
[31:50] guys have some truth here that you know
[31:53] a lot of preachers in the world that
[31:55] would argue with you if you said paul
[31:56] wrote the book of hebrews but if you
[31:59] believe the message for the hour brother
[32:00] branham told us that you can't there's
[32:03] no question that paul
[32:04] wrote this these 13 chapters here but
[32:07] i'll just let me read to where i feel
[32:09] led to stop
[32:12] in this first verse let brotherly love
[32:15] continue
[32:16] be not forgetful to entertain strangers
[32:19] for thereby some have entertained angels
[32:21] unaware
[32:22] you know he's basically giving you a
[32:24] truth in life no matter
[32:26] how you feel in the natural
[32:28] doesn't give you a right to treat people
[32:30] in a bad way no matter how bad you're
[32:32] feeling how angry you are how sad you
[32:35] are when you're dealing with people you
[32:37] need to freedom in a loving way
[32:40] remember them that are in bonds as bound
[32:43] with them and them which suffer
[32:44] adversity as being yourself also in the
[32:47] body
[32:49] if marriage isn't honorable in all and
[32:51] the bed on the file but whoremongers and
[32:54] adulterers god will judge when i read
[32:56] that last sentence there because your
[32:58] semicolons there
[32:59] you know that's pretty brutal for the
[33:01] age that we live in right now
[33:03] they think they're going to get away
[33:04] without being judged for their
[33:06] adulterous and whoremongering ways and
[33:09] it's you're not going to escape it let
[33:12] your conversation be without covetedness
[33:15] be content with such things as you have
[33:18] for he that hath said i will never leave
[33:20] thee nor for safety that goes against
[33:22] our hd that fifth verse right there it's
[33:25] a very covetous eight
[33:27] that we
[33:29] live in every
[33:31] once after learning people along the way
[33:34] and he goes on to say in the sixth verse
[33:36] so that we may boldly say the lord is my
[33:39] helper and i will not fear
[33:41] what men shall do unto me you know
[33:44] that's true
[33:45] he goes on and remember them which have
[33:47] ruled over you
[33:48] which have spoken unto you the word of
[33:51] god
[33:52] whose faith follow considering the end
[33:54] of their conversation and if that's
[33:57] another scripture
[33:59] you know people don't want to accept
[34:01] authority anymore in the age that we
[34:03] live in
[34:04] in a in a governmental sense or in a
[34:07] christian sense and i'll just finish
[34:09] with this jesus christ the same
[34:11] yesterday today and forever so whatever
[34:13] god told us
[34:15] 2 000 years ago in the gospel is no
[34:17] different for us today every you know
[34:19] people tell you that but you have to
[34:21] receive it it's got to be seed in your
[34:22] heart if god made a promise
[34:25] all the promises of god are true if
[34:27] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[34:29] and forever those promises apply to you
[34:32] this morning if you just reach out in
[34:34] faith and accept those promises
[34:37] and i was i listened to
[34:39] several things
[34:40] but i'll just i hope i go to the right
[34:43] place here
[34:45] you know not wanting to be out of order
[34:47] you know the
[34:48] in corinthians it says the spirit is
[34:51] subject you know
[34:52] but uh i'll just read this quote here
[34:54] this morning
[34:55] it comes out out of this match as i
[34:58] stand at the door and knock
[35:01] and i i was i wrote a note down here on
[35:03] the side margin everything we do
[35:06] motive is everything that we do what
[35:08] your motive is that that tells me
[35:11] who you are or what you are what your
[35:13] motive is
[35:14] what do you bring what are you doing
[35:16] what is the motive for the reason you're
[35:18] doing things and only you can examine
[35:20] your heart and life and know what your
[35:22] motive is and anything
[35:24] that you're doing
[35:25] and uh this is the 56 quote
[35:29] and he's you know he's in this message
[35:32] he's talking about god knocking at your
[35:34] heart and going for all the all the
[35:36] rooms of your soul and all the rooms of
[35:38] your heart your spirit and this is one
[35:41] quote here
[35:42] i want to welcome him this morning in my
[35:44] heart to every room to all that i am
[35:47] i want to welcome him at every door
[35:49] swing it open and stand there and kiss
[35:52] the cup a blessing with him in the door
[35:54] and say yes lord all i am and all i have
[35:57] and all is yours and let's stand at this
[36:00] door lord and commune with each other
[36:02] and let us commune at the door of faith
[36:04] lord let us have communion at the door
[36:06] of pride lord let us have communion at
[36:08] the door of selfishness lord take it all
[36:12] from me lord faith and he's that's
[36:14] pretty true today as it was when he
[36:16] preached this i think this was in 1957
[36:20] and i'll leave with that this morning
[36:23] all i would have to
[36:25] say to us this morning everything that
[36:27] we are this morning is in jesus christ
[36:29] and whatever your need is this morning
[36:31] whatever god wants to do for you this
[36:33] morning he's more than able here this
[36:36] morning to meet your needs whatever they
[36:38] are whether they're physical spiritual
[36:40] natural whatever they are i know that
[36:42] god can meet our needs this morning
[36:45] so as brother josh comes just hold your
[36:47] faith out this morning

[59:31] it up for us
[59:33] uh turn in your bible you would to john
[59:36] 16.
[59:38] i noticed we read in the scripture
[59:39] picture earlier today already of john 3
[59:42] i think so we'll turn to john 16.
[59:48] i'm going to try to take a little
[59:49] thought this morning that
[59:52] you'll have to just bear with me i'm
[59:53] going to try to slow it down a little
[59:56] bit maybe
[59:58] emphasize some things uh pretty heavy
[1:00:00] that i feel like we need as believers in
[1:00:03] this hour and
[1:00:04] and uh
[1:00:05] looking at a
[1:00:06] i guess a little thought if if we put a
[1:00:08] title on it
[1:00:10] a neurotic age
[1:00:12] and uh you think when you hear brother
[1:00:15] branham talk about that you think that
[1:00:17] uh
[1:00:18] you you think he's talking about the age
[1:00:20] that he was in or the people around him
[1:00:22] when in fact if you really list look and
[1:00:24] listen and kind of break it down
[1:00:27] uh you'll see he maybe was talking more
[1:00:29] about us as believers in the age we're
[1:00:31] living in so
[1:00:33] uh yeah let's just we'll break that down
[1:00:35] if we can so
[1:00:37] john 16 will go to verse 19.
[1:00:40] um verse 19
[1:00:43] and chapter 16 of john
[1:00:45] now jesus knew that they were desirous
[1:00:47] to ask him and said unto them do you
[1:00:49] inquire amongst yourselves of that i
[1:00:51] said a little while and you
[1:00:53] shall see shall not see me and again a
[1:00:56] little while and you shall see me
[1:00:58] verily verily i say unto you unto you
[1:01:01] that ye shall weep and lay man but the
[1:01:04] world shall rejoice and ye shall
[1:01:07] be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be
[1:01:09] turned into joy
[1:01:12] a woman when she is in travail hath
[1:01:15] sorrow
[1:01:16] because her hour has come
[1:01:18] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[1:01:20] child she remembereth no more the
[1:01:22] anguish for the joy that a man is born
[1:01:25] into the world we look at that verse
[1:01:27] right there and you see that she is in
[1:01:28] travail and has sorrow because her hour
[1:01:31] has come if we were to ask any of the
[1:01:33] ladies or the mothers here that's had
[1:01:35] children
[1:01:36] you could ask what is that travail what
[1:01:37] are you talking about what is that if
[1:01:39] they would tell you they would say it's
[1:01:40] a feeling of pressure
[1:01:42] okay they're in travail they're in pain
[1:01:45] they're in pressure am i right
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:49] uh but but her hour has come but as soon
[1:01:52] as she is delivered she remembers the
[1:01:55] pressure that pain that anguish no more
[1:01:57] because now she's in a joyous state now
[1:02:00] that baby's been placed into her arms
[1:02:03] and she's holding her coddling her her
[1:02:05] baby and and things are now changed you
[1:02:07] don't feel it anymore the pain and the
[1:02:09] pressure is gone let's continue on and
[1:02:11] you and you now therefore have sorrow
[1:02:13] but i will see you again and your heart
[1:02:15] shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh
[1:02:18] from you aren't you thankful for that
[1:02:21] and in that day you shall ask me nothing
[1:02:23] verily verily i say unto you whatsoever
[1:02:25] you shall ask and the father in my name
[1:02:28] he will give it to you
[1:02:29] hitherto have ye asked nothing in my
[1:02:31] name ask and you shall receive that your
[1:02:33] joy may be full
[1:02:35] these things have i spoken unto you in
[1:02:37] proverbs so he's speaking to him now in
[1:02:40] kind of a a christian code you might say
[1:02:43] proverbs you know you have to be a
[1:02:44] christian you have to be a follower a
[1:02:46] disciple to listen and understand and
[1:02:48] break down what he's saying and he
[1:02:50] they're not even sure really what is
[1:02:51] what he's talking about here
[1:02:53] and he says i'm going to have to speak
[1:02:55] this plainly to you he said but the time
[1:02:56] come when shall i shall no more speak
[1:02:59] unto you in proverbs but i shall show
[1:03:01] you plainly of the father
[1:03:03] that in the day that you ask in my name
[1:03:06] i say not unto you that i will pray the
[1:03:09] father for you for the father himself
[1:03:11] loveth you because you have loved me and
[1:03:13] you have believed that i came out from
[1:03:15] father from god sorry i came forth from
[1:03:18] the father i'm coming to the world again
[1:03:20] i leave the world and go to the father
[1:03:24] his disciples said unto him lo now speak
[1:03:27] thou plainly plainly and speak as no
[1:03:30] proverb please lord speak to us plain
[1:03:32] tell us what you're saying
[1:03:34] and he says
[1:03:35] not now that we are sure they know us
[1:03:37] all things and need us
[1:03:39] not that any man should ask thee
[1:03:41] by this we believe they'll come us from
[1:03:43] god and jesus answered them and said do
[1:03:45] ye now believe
[1:03:47] behold the hour is cometh yea
[1:03:50] is now come that you shall be scattered
[1:03:52] every man to his own and shall leave me
[1:03:55] alone and yet i am not alone because the
[1:03:57] father is with me
[1:03:59] and i want to get to this right here
[1:04:01] verse 33
[1:04:03] these things i have spoken unto you that
[1:04:04] in me
[1:04:06] you might have peace
[1:04:07] in the world ye shall have tribulation
[1:04:13] in the world ye shall have tribulation
[1:04:17] but
[1:04:18] be of good cheer
[1:04:19] what's it say next
[1:04:21] i have overcome
[1:04:24] the world
[1:04:26] what a savior i have overcome the world
[1:04:30] so i'm going to speak like i said on the
[1:04:32] on this morning on living in a neurotic
[1:04:34] age let's just pray heavenly father we
[1:04:37] thankful to be in your house this
[1:04:38] morning thankful for those that's come
[1:04:40] out to
[1:04:41] worship around your word to fellowship
[1:04:43] with believers and sisters
[1:04:45] uh brothers and sisters of light
[1:04:46] precious faith just to come and and to
[1:04:49] hear the word the word that's
[1:04:52] sent to draw us closer to you lord
[1:04:54] and lord we thank you for where you
[1:04:56] brought us from and thankful for where
[1:04:58] you're taking us lord and we just asked
[1:05:00] or that you just ministered to our
[1:05:02] hearts this morning speak to us lip to
[1:05:04] ear help me to
[1:05:06] allow me to get myself out of the way
[1:05:07] that i could just bring this message to
[1:05:09] drop close and to bring us closer as
[1:05:12] believers to be able to overcome this
[1:05:15] neurotic age we live in we just want to
[1:05:17] tell you we love you we appreciate you
[1:05:19] and dedicate the service into your hands
[1:05:22] and that all that be said and done being
[1:05:23] bring honor and glory to you in jesus
[1:05:26] name amen you can have your seats
[1:05:30] so speaking about this neurotic age and
[1:05:33] like i said i'm going to try to i'm
[1:05:34] going to take things and try to break it
[1:05:36] down some some definition some words
[1:05:38] some terminology because i think we're
[1:05:40] living
[1:05:42] in an age that uh we're all in
[1:05:44] unfamiliar territory right now
[1:05:46] uh we think we've been under pressure we
[1:05:48] think we know stress we think we
[1:05:50] understand neurotic
[1:05:52] behavior but we're i think we're in
[1:05:54] unchartered water uh pressure that we've
[1:05:56] never seen before and pressure that will
[1:05:58] be coming
[1:05:59] uh before the rapture takes place to get
[1:06:02] his people ready so
[1:06:04] uh when i look at neurotic i looked up
[1:06:06] that definition here brother brown used
[1:06:07] that back in the 60s 50s 60s
[1:06:10] it means anxiety and depression and
[1:06:13] worry guilt
[1:06:14] you react negatively to things around
[1:06:17] you you're irritable you're angry
[1:06:21] you can feel threatened
[1:06:23] you even have a feelings of depression
[1:06:25] at times
[1:06:26] and when he began to speak on this he's
[1:06:28] spoken in several messages one of them
[1:06:30] he spoke on this plainly and clearly
[1:06:32] many times was in letting off the
[1:06:34] pressure and when he
[1:06:36] speaks about this he says what would i
[1:06:38] speak to this congregation
[1:06:40] and he said i thought to myself well
[1:06:42] they're probably trained right in
[1:06:43] everything no doubt i feel like we've
[1:06:46] been trained right and about everything
[1:06:48] we can possibly be trained in the
[1:06:50] message of an hour has laid out the word
[1:06:52] it's laid out the scriptures it's opened
[1:06:54] up the word the mysteries of god have
[1:06:56] been revealed so we've been trained
[1:06:57] beyond a doubt the way we should be
[1:06:59] trained
[1:07:00] and he says but there's pressure on the
[1:07:03] people today
[1:07:04] and that pressure listen now has no
[1:07:07] limitations
[1:07:08] or any denominational
[1:07:11] lines
[1:07:12] it has no age lines it has no respect of
[1:07:15] person it's on young and old and good
[1:07:18] and bad it's on everybody pressure
[1:07:23] he said we're living in a neurotic age
[1:07:26] nervous tension
[1:07:29] if i were to ask you and it's okay we're
[1:07:31] going to be honest with each other today
[1:07:33] if i were to ask you how many of you
[1:07:34] have felt like you've been under some
[1:07:35] pressure this week
[1:07:38] look at those hands
[1:07:39] hands everywhere why because we're
[1:07:41] living in a pressure age and he says
[1:07:44] it's nervous tension everybody's racing
[1:07:46] here and and going there and going
[1:07:49] nowhere it's just that kind of age and i
[1:07:51] know this church would be played with it
[1:07:54] as it's everywhere is plagued with it
[1:07:58] the tabernacle is plagued with it
[1:08:00] everywhere the whole world it's a day of
[1:08:02] pressure
[1:08:03] hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and
[1:08:05] wait
[1:08:06] he said we drive 90 miles an hour to get
[1:08:09] home for supper and wait two hours for
[1:08:11] it to get ready
[1:08:15] was that was that last week
[1:08:19] how many have you done that last week
[1:08:21] think about it hurry hurry hurry and
[1:08:24] then wait that's right it's a time it's
[1:08:26] in the rushing and speeding and it gets
[1:08:28] you in that nervous tension
[1:08:32] now we're getting into the home front
[1:08:35] wife said something a little contrary
[1:08:38] and you want to fly off the temper
[1:08:43] that's that nervous tension
[1:08:45] husband say something you'll pat your
[1:08:47] foot and you'll tell him get in the room
[1:08:51] well now husband i don't want no words
[1:08:53] with you go out there
[1:08:57] nervous tension what causes this
[1:09:00] pressure
[1:09:02] wife i'm i'm so nervous
[1:09:05] what's the matter see it's all this
[1:09:07] tension building up and then the result
[1:09:09] of it is doing something wrong and
[1:09:11] acting out of place
[1:09:18] i think we've got angels in here this
[1:09:19] morning
[1:09:22] doing something wrong and acted out of
[1:09:24] place and he said it'll make the poor at
[1:09:26] that way
[1:09:27] it'll make the middle class act that way
[1:09:30] it'll make the rich act that way it'll
[1:09:32] make the wrong act that way it'll make
[1:09:34] the pretty good act that way and it'll
[1:09:36] make the good act that way
[1:09:39] oh we've hit everybody now hasn't we
[1:09:42] and he says it's the steam it's the
[1:09:44] tension it's built up it's you've got to
[1:09:46] blow it somewhere it's got you've got to
[1:09:48] blow it up the boiler's got to blow up
[1:09:50] and he said it builds up as the day goes
[1:09:54] you wake up you're in a pretty good

[1:10:16] the brunt of the pressure

[1:10:43] said
[1:10:46] over the last couple of weeks i've been
[1:10:47] just praying and it's been coming to me
[1:10:50] constantly this this thought of pressure
[1:10:52] and i think we're living in a day of
[1:10:54] tremendous pressure
[1:10:56] and stress that is caused by this
[1:10:59] pressure
[1:11:00] just turn on the news for a few minutes
[1:11:02] and you'll begin to find plenty to
[1:11:04] stress over
[1:11:08] the economy i say we're living in
[1:11:09] unchartered waters
[1:11:11] we've never felt this kind of pressure
[1:11:14] farmers are talking about how it's
[1:11:16] costing a thousand fifteen hundred two
[1:11:18] thousand dollars a day
[1:11:20] in fuel to put
[1:11:22] crops out
[1:11:24] truck drivers are spending
[1:11:26] thousand twelve hundred dollars a day to
[1:11:29] fill up a fuel tank
[1:11:33] do you realize that's putting a strain
[1:11:36] and a stress
[1:11:38] and a pressure

[1:12:00] and i said i'm tired of watching the
[1:12:02] news because everything in the news is
[1:12:04] negative
[1:12:05] and that negativity constantly is
[1:12:07] producing what pressure
[1:12:09] and that pressure begins to produce what

[1:13:17] that was his words

[1:13:21] row one after another after another
[1:13:24] yesterday

[1:13:28] said how's it going i ain't seeing you
[1:13:29] he said man
[1:13:30] he said i i i'm stressed out

[1:13:57] he's not a
[1:13:58] doctor he's not doing surgery on people
[1:14:03] he's not he's not a pastor of a church
[1:14:05] trying to make sure people are people
[1:14:07] are well he's a landscape he's planting
[1:14:08] flowers and mulching and mowing
[1:14:12] and he's under so much stress that he
[1:14:14] can't even sleep at night brother
[1:14:15] sisters this world is in a completely
[1:14:17] neurotic and stress-ridden state right
[1:14:20] now
[1:14:22] and when we look at stress
[1:14:24] what is stress
[1:14:26] stress is a feeling of being under too
[1:14:28] much mental or emotional pressure
[1:14:32] and here's where i'm going to slow it
[1:14:33] down and and and see you you listen to
[1:14:36] some of these things and say hey
[1:14:38] i'm going to check up from the neck up
[1:14:40] because i don't need pressure and stress
[1:14:42] getting in my head
[1:14:45] we don't need that as christians and
[1:14:47] believers we don't need things to pull
[1:14:50] us down to drag us down to hinder our
[1:14:53] homes to hinder our jobs listen we got a
[1:14:56] lot of people in here that are in high
[1:14:57] stress situations
[1:15:05] pressure turns into stress when you feel
[1:15:08] unable to cope people have different
[1:15:11] ways of reacting to stress if you notice
[1:15:13] that
[1:15:15] one situation to somebody that feels
[1:15:17] stressful to this person
[1:15:19] this person over here feeds off of it
[1:15:21] they're motivated by it
[1:15:23] this person over here the same stressor
[1:15:25] that puts this person in depression this
[1:15:27] person right here is ready to go tackle
[1:15:29] the world
[1:15:31] so we can't say it's this one thing for
[1:15:33] everybody no
[1:15:35] because stressors come in different
[1:15:36] forms in different fashions
[1:15:38] and life's demands is what causes stress
[1:15:43] your work
[1:15:46] your relationships at
[1:15:50] home i'm preaching to myself
[1:15:55] because my wife has told me in the not
[1:15:57] too far go past
[1:16:01] that you're so irritable
[1:16:05] why why am i irritable
[1:16:08] nothing is everything is good
[1:16:10] everything's fine there's nothing wrong
[1:16:13] but why is every little thing just
[1:16:15] puts me on edge
[1:16:20] stressors pressure
[1:16:22] stressors
[1:16:24] relationships money problems you want
[1:16:26] stress in a marriage
[1:16:29] have money problems
[1:16:34] manage your money
[1:16:36] to the best of your ability and if you
[1:16:37] don't know how ask somebody for help
[1:16:39] go see your pastor
[1:16:43] he's your financial advisor if you need
[1:16:45] help say i don't know what i'm doing
[1:16:46] with my money i don't know how to handle
[1:16:48] it i don't know where to spend it i
[1:16:49] don't know how to save it i don't go see
[1:16:51] him but he knows how to tell you how to
[1:16:53] do that
[1:16:57] don't let money be a stressor that ruins
[1:16:59] your marriage and your relationship with
[1:17:02] your children
[1:17:06] when you begin to feel stress you can
[1:17:08] get in the way
[1:17:10] these demands you can't sort them out
[1:17:13] have you ever noticed that when you
[1:17:14] start getting under this pressure in the
[1:17:16] stress they begin to overlap
[1:17:20] you heard it when it rains it pours
[1:17:24] well let me tell you it's raining on a
[1:17:26] sunny day
[1:17:28] when it rains it pours they begin to
[1:17:30] overlap it's this and then it's this and
[1:17:31] then it's this and then it's the
[1:17:33] children then it's the wife and then
[1:17:34] it's money then it's the car then it's
[1:17:36] the house payment
[1:17:37] oh boy then you have a flat tire
[1:17:42] i can't get to work and then the
[1:17:44] pressure keeps coming and coming and
[1:17:45] coming
[1:17:48] and this stress begins to affect how you
[1:17:50] feel
[1:17:52] it begins to affect how you think
[1:17:55] it begins to affect how your body works
[1:18:03] sleeping problems
[1:18:06] sweating
[1:18:07] loss of appetite
[1:18:09] difficulty concentrating has anybody
[1:18:11] ever noticed sometimes when you get
[1:18:12] under stress and maybe this person's
[1:18:14] asking you a question you got this on
[1:18:16] your mind they ask you and next thing
[1:18:17] you're just in a mental fog
[1:18:20] and you don't even know what they've
[1:18:21] said and you're just sitting there
[1:18:22] nodding
[1:18:23] yeah yeah
[1:18:25] yep
[1:18:27] and you walk away you think what in the
[1:18:29] world did i just agree to
[1:18:35] you begin to feel anxious
[1:18:38] and irritable
[1:18:40] your self-esteem begins to go down
[1:18:47] your thoughts begin to race
[1:18:51] and you can't slow down
[1:18:54] i i
[1:18:56] i just told weston the other day i said
[1:18:57] you know son oh he's talking about
[1:18:59] sleeping habits and so i said i just
[1:19:01] don't i've never required much sleep i
[1:19:03] can go to bed at 11 12 o'clock get up at
[1:19:05] 4 35 i said because my mind just keeps
[1:19:08] working it just goes
[1:19:11] and i can't fix this problem before i'm
[1:19:13] already thinking about this and i and it
[1:19:14] just constantly it's just constantly in
[1:19:16] motion i said i maybe i'm like leonardo
[1:19:19] da vinci was i think he worked six hours
[1:19:21] slept three work six slept three worked
[1:19:23] six left three
[1:19:26] because he was constantly emotion
[1:19:30] it reflects
[1:19:32] your mind it affects your sleeping
[1:19:36] the next thing you notice is you begin
[1:19:37] to lose your temper
[1:19:42] yep
[1:19:44] and you act unreasonably
[1:19:47] yeah have you ever have you ever known
[1:19:49] have you ever had that happen where you
[1:19:51] you're in a discussion and maybe a
[1:19:52] little bit of a a
[1:19:54] little bit of a qualm or quarrel with
[1:19:56] your spouse
[1:19:59] can you say the most unreasonable thing
[1:20:01] that you can imagine knowing that you
[1:20:03] don't even believe it but but because
[1:20:05] your mind is not working right and your
[1:20:07] temper's up you say something that's
[1:20:09] completely irrational
[1:20:13] some of you know what i'm talking about
[1:20:15] and you would have never said that if
[1:20:17] you were in your calm
[1:20:19] christian state of mind
[1:20:24] and then you begin to experience
[1:20:26] headaches
[1:20:30] man my head's just hurting i got to go
[1:20:32] to bed my neck i'm so tight my back i
[1:20:35] can't
[1:20:36] i think i'm having a heart attack
[1:20:41] this is pressure
[1:20:43] dizziness
[1:20:44] because what happens is the stress when
[1:20:46] it becomes in your life you get these
[1:20:48] hormones begin to come up and they boost
[1:20:50] up and you get these uh these endorphins
[1:20:52] that come up and it's like your fight or
[1:20:54] flight i'm here to survive and it
[1:20:56] doesn't matter if it's your wife if it's
[1:20:58] your best friend
[1:20:59] when you're under stress and under
[1:21:01] pressure they say the wrong thing
[1:21:03] bam i'm going to fight i'm going to
[1:21:04] survive you won't beat me
[1:21:08] and these emotions begin to get up here
[1:21:10] [Applause]
[1:21:12] but what happens is if the lion is
[1:21:14] chasing you you're running and your
[1:21:16] emotions are up high when the lion goes
[1:21:18] away you calm back down
[1:21:22] but when you're overwhelmed with stress
[1:21:24] and pressure
[1:21:26] those endorphins never come down they
[1:21:28] stay up here so you're constantly on
[1:21:30] defense you're constantly in a full
[1:21:32] state of motion you're constantly and
[1:21:35] anxious you're constantly waiting for
[1:21:37] the next problem and when it hits bam
[1:21:42] because you're up here
[1:21:45] bring it down here
[1:21:51] we need those stressors to come down
[1:21:56] so we have to ask ourselves i said we're
[1:21:58] in unchartered waters
[1:22:00] things have changed things are different
[1:22:02] what has changed what is different you
[1:22:04] want to know what's going on
[1:22:07] i'm fixing to tell you what i think is
[1:22:09] going on
[1:22:13] the problems that plague our modern day
[1:22:15] were the same problems we had
[1:22:17] 30 years ago
[1:22:20] 40 years ago
[1:22:22] it's the same problems we still have
[1:22:24] money issues there's still the rich
[1:22:27] there's still the poor there's still
[1:22:28] rumors of war there's still all these
[1:22:30] things uh controversies that's going on
[1:22:33] in work and family
[1:22:35] it's nothing new
[1:22:37] stress and anxiety has been around since
[1:22:39] the garden eden
[1:22:41] i'd say adam was under a little bit of
[1:22:43] pressure
[1:22:45] i'd say he felt a little bit of anxiety
[1:22:47] with what was going on
[1:22:50] so what is it has changed
[1:22:53] what has changed is the shift in
[1:22:55] technology
[1:22:58] how many thought i was going there
[1:23:03] think about this now the change has come
[1:23:06] in the shift of technology the way we
[1:23:08] relate to the world over the last three
[1:23:11] decades brothers and sisters our access
[1:23:13] to information
[1:23:15] and connecting to people all around the
[1:23:18] world all the time begins to feed our
[1:23:20] stress
[1:23:29] you know years ago if a war was fixing
[1:23:32] to take place
[1:23:34] you'd know it a week later in the
[1:23:36] newspaper is that right
[1:23:38] or if you have if you had the luxury of
[1:23:40] owning a radio
[1:23:42] you could dial in and you could hear
[1:23:46] attention with you know attention so and
[1:23:48] so it's good happening
[1:23:51] and once you found out that the war was
[1:23:52] taking place it was another week
[1:23:55] or two or three weeks into the war
[1:23:57] before you ever find out what's going on
[1:23:59] so your day-to-day living just kept kind
[1:24:01] of cruising on its lower paced speeds
[1:24:06] but today it's not that way we have full
[1:24:08] access
[1:24:10] second by second by second updates
[1:24:14] we know what's going on in russia before
[1:24:16] they know what's going on in russia
[1:24:19] and the first sign of a rumor listen to
[1:24:21] where these stressors come from the
[1:24:23] first sign of a room or anything
[1:24:25] happening what does it affect
[1:24:27] wall street
[1:24:32] the economy goes down the second they
[1:24:34] talk about a war the second they they
[1:24:36] put a new president in the very second
[1:24:39] anything happens
[1:24:40] the second there's a bridge collapse the
[1:24:42] second there's an earthquake
[1:24:46] the second the cardinals beat the cubs
[1:24:50] wall street goes down
[1:24:54] what does that do
[1:24:55] you say what i'm not a rich person
[1:24:58] we're in kentucky what does that affect
[1:24:59] us
[1:25:01] a few years ago i remember buying eggs
[1:25:03] for 59 cents a dozen
[1:25:05] somebody sell me some for 59 cents a
[1:25:07] dozen now i'll take about 12 dozen
[1:25:15] go buy some meat
[1:25:18] go buy some bread
[1:25:20] go buy some milk
[1:25:22] what is milk now uh let's see the other
[1:25:24] day i was at the dollar general joe i
[1:25:26] said can you stop and get a gallon of
[1:25:27] milk sure i'll stop in there and get
[1:25:29] some you know what they had one half
[1:25:31] gallon of milk for four dollars and nine
[1:25:33] cents
[1:25:36] yeah
[1:25:38] unheard of prices you say that how does
[1:25:41] that affect us it constantly keeps the
[1:25:43] the stressors keep going up
[1:25:46] the demands keep going up
[1:25:52] so this constant connection information
[1:25:55] could be great in some ways but it never
[1:25:57] gives you a break
[1:25:59] you never have a chance to slow down
[1:26:01] unwind turn things down and just just
[1:26:04] enjoy the moment
[1:26:08] stressors and pressure
[1:26:12] so what does the devil do
[1:26:14] he says i'm gonna allow them to work
[1:26:15] from home
[1:26:17] on their computer
[1:26:22] they don't get enough of this
[1:26:26] facebook and their downtime
[1:26:28] we'll send them all home to work on
[1:26:29] their computers
[1:26:34] it's an age of laptops
[1:26:36] work from home
[1:26:38] i was having lunch with a friend the
[1:26:40] other day and he run into an
[1:26:41] acquaintance i didn't know who she was
[1:26:43] but he said hey how's your husband doing
[1:26:44] well he's doing good
[1:26:46] is he staying busy oh yeah he he he says
[1:26:49] he takes off on thursday he's this guy
[1:26:50] what he was talking about was a pastor
[1:26:52] of a church he said yeah he says he
[1:26:54] takes off on thursdays to just sit home
[1:26:56] and rest but he always asks me to go get
[1:26:58] his computer and he starts typing emails
[1:27:02] never a moment to stop and slow down
[1:27:04] just constantly under this pressure of
[1:27:06] work work do do do
[1:27:09] and all of you many of you know the
[1:27:11] drill i'm talking about
[1:27:13] how many of you check your emails
[1:27:15] facebook
[1:27:16] instagram facetime whatever's out there
[1:27:19] right before you go to bed
[1:27:22] come on people
[1:27:24] come on people
[1:27:29] sure we do
[1:27:30] but you know what one of the worst
[1:27:32] things that you can do
[1:27:34] for your sleeping pattern
[1:27:36] is to look at a blue screen on a
[1:27:38] computer
[1:27:39] tablet or cell phone right before you go
[1:27:42] to bed
[1:27:44] you know what it does to you let me tell
[1:27:46] you satan is a smart smart person
[1:27:49] he's a smart entity because when you
[1:27:51] look at that blue screen and you're
[1:27:53] saying man i got to find out got to make
[1:27:54] sure there's nothing come through man i
[1:27:56] got to make sure nobody commented on my
[1:27:57] status
[1:28:01] it makes your melatonin drop
[1:28:05] blue light
[1:28:07] makes you want to
[1:28:08] rise up
[1:28:10] it makes you want to be energetic
[1:28:12] and your melatonin goes down so now
[1:28:15] you're sitting there and your circadian
[1:28:17] rhythm your sleep pattern is all
[1:28:19] disrupted because now you've been
[1:28:21] looking at this computer and you're
[1:28:22] exhausted tired but you can't fall
[1:28:25] asleep
[1:28:29] and then when you do fall asleep you're
[1:28:31] waking up because you're here
[1:28:34] oh that was that was a text come through
[1:28:36] i better see what's going on
[1:28:40] and this goes on all night
[1:28:43] and you think you're getting a good
[1:28:44] sleep and you wake up you look at your
[1:28:46] phone and it starts all over
[1:28:49] you say what's that got to do with with
[1:28:51] my stress my pressure well let me tell
[1:28:52] you if you're tired
[1:28:54] and you're exhausted and you're not
[1:28:56] sleeping well
[1:28:57] are you a little bit irritable brother
[1:28:59] jeff he's shaking his head oh yeah
[1:29:03] yeah because you begin to get irritable
[1:29:05] and you get tired and the pressures
[1:29:06] begin to add up and overlap end over end
[1:29:09] over in and it's a constant thing
[1:29:11] so we need to be careful with this big
[1:29:13] express event of this information age
[1:29:16] that we're living in technology and
[1:29:18] information
[1:29:20] because we're getting stress overload
[1:29:24] and it's turning the world into this
[1:29:26] neurotic that he was talking about
[1:29:28] let's look at pressure pressure is
[1:29:30] defined as the burden of physical or
[1:29:32] mental distress
[1:29:34] it's a constant
[1:29:35] a a weight of social or economic
[1:29:39] imposition
[1:29:41] this this is this the stress of urgency
[1:29:43] of matters demanding attention
[1:29:47] you ever felt like you had so much to do
[1:29:49] with you don't even know where to start
[1:29:54] that's not a fun feeling because it
[1:29:56] usually puts you in a position that you
[1:29:58] you don't ever start
[1:30:01] because you have no goal you have no
[1:30:03] agenda you can't get anything in order
[1:30:05] and it just puts you that much farther
[1:30:06] behind pressure pressure
[1:30:09] i like the verb definition of pressure
[1:30:12] to cook in a pressure cooker
[1:30:18] how many ever feel like you're living in
[1:30:20] a pressure cooker
[1:30:22] you feel like you're living in a
[1:30:23] pressure cooker of life
[1:30:29] hey don't get discouraged
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:33] years with that brothers and sisters
[1:30:34] because some of the greatest things in
[1:30:36] the
[1:30:38] i know to this point i've made it sound
[1:30:39] like it's
[1:30:41] we're in doom
[1:30:43] but some of the greatest things that
[1:30:44] ever happened happened under pressure we
[1:30:47] need some pressure in our lives
[1:30:49] we have to have some pressure and i want
[1:30:52] you to know that this morning because
[1:30:53] pressure pushes us to prayer
[1:30:55] pressure pushes us to rely on god
[1:30:58] pressure pushes us to dedicate our lives
[1:31:02] to christ so it's not an entirely bad
[1:31:04] thing
[1:31:07] but when we allow pressure to convert
[1:31:09] into stress that's where our problem
[1:31:12] begins
[1:31:15] philippians 3
[1:31:16] paul's telling the people here brethren
[1:31:18] i count not myself to have apprehended
[1:31:21] but this one thing i do forgetting those
[1:31:23] things which are behind
[1:31:24] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:31:26] which are before us
[1:31:28] once they say i what press
[1:31:33] i press toward the mark of the high
[1:31:35] calling of god in christ jesus
[1:31:39] therefore let us as many be perfect thus
[1:31:41] minded if anything ye otherwise be might
[1:31:44] be otherwise mighty god shall reveal
[1:31:46] even this unto you
[1:31:48] i press toward
[1:31:52] let me tell you something about paul
[1:31:56] paul was under a lot of pressure
[1:31:58] paul was under a lot of persecution paul
[1:32:01] was under a lot of ridicule in the day
[1:32:02] he was living in but he looked at this
[1:32:04] situation he said no matter what i'm
[1:32:06] going through
[1:32:08] i have to endure this pressure because
[1:32:10] i'm not where i want to be yet
[1:32:14] and i'm going to press on even though
[1:32:16] the pressure's on me i'm pressing on he
[1:32:19] knew he had to press on and couldn't
[1:32:21] turn back brothers and sisters how many
[1:32:23] of us this morning are planning to go on
[1:32:24] the rapture raise your hand
[1:32:27] are you there yet
[1:32:30] no we're not there yet but we're
[1:32:32] planning to go we're not we're not there
[1:32:33] just quite yet so that means there's
[1:32:35] more for us here to attain with our walk
[1:32:38] from god that's why we have some
[1:32:40] pressure
[1:32:42] to push us into a walk in a relationship
[1:32:45] with god that we can't be held back and
[1:32:47] with the because the pressure we
[1:32:50] feel around us it ought to be the
[1:32:52] greatest motivator in your life
[1:32:56] the pressure that comes upon you it
[1:32:58] ought to motivate you into a place that
[1:33:00] nothing
[1:33:02] here
[1:33:03] compares to the joy of jesus christ
[1:33:09] as i thought about this
[1:33:11] as i thought about this it's the
[1:33:13] pressure
[1:33:14] that that makes me long for the catching
[1:33:17] away of the church
[1:33:20] because the pressure is something that
[1:33:22] we're not going to get rid of
[1:33:25] you can't outrun it
[1:33:28] the only thing you can do is outlive it
[1:33:32] by living in christ
[1:33:34] and i was thinking about this you know i
[1:33:36] got a little spot on our on our farm
[1:33:38] that i don't know what it is about it it
[1:33:40] just it just pulls me there
[1:33:43] it's quiet
[1:33:44] it's calm
[1:33:46] it even has a an aroma about it that
[1:33:49] just
[1:33:50] soothes you down
[1:33:52] and i thought as nice as this is
[1:33:55] as nice as this is and as calm as it is
[1:33:57] for me to just go up there and meditate
[1:33:59] and pray and think and just get away
[1:34:01] from the stress for a little while it's
[1:34:04] nothing comparable to what it'll be when
[1:34:06] i face jesus
[1:34:07] in my lord
[1:34:08] it's nothing comparable there's not
[1:34:10] enough joy here on this earth that can
[1:34:12] even come close to comparing
[1:34:16] we need a little pressure to keep us on
[1:34:18] our toes
[1:34:19] [Music]
[1:34:21] he says i was speaking here not long ago
[1:34:23] about being in africa watching a little
[1:34:25] lamb from where the natives had this
[1:34:27] little corral and they let this little
[1:34:29] fella out and he was grazing
[1:34:31] and all the once he got real nervous
[1:34:34] and i thought what's the matter with
[1:34:35] this little guy
[1:34:39] he said but as i watched
[1:34:41] he couldn't see it
[1:34:42] but in the distance was this great big
[1:34:44] yellow main line
[1:34:47] slipping through the grass
[1:34:49] he said he smelled this little lamb and
[1:34:51] was making his way to him
[1:34:55] and he said he was so nervous he didn't
[1:34:57] know why sometimes we call it a
[1:34:59] premonition
[1:35:00] but now the reason was he was nervous he
[1:35:02] didn't see the line but he know death
[1:35:04] was lurking near
[1:35:11] the world he
[1:35:12] says seems to be in the same condition
[1:35:17] they know that something is lingering
[1:35:19] near
[1:35:20] that something is fixing to happen
[1:35:22] he says it builds up pressure of course
[1:35:25] to the center but the christian who's
[1:35:27] instructed in the word ought to know
[1:35:29] that it's the coming of the lord
[1:35:33] so we need this pressure because it is
[1:35:35] an alert it's a warning it's it's
[1:35:37] telling us get ready get ready get ready
[1:35:40] the more pressure that comes upon this
[1:35:42] earth is is god pushing his bride to
[1:35:45] getting themselves into a better place
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:50] he says but the christian who's
[1:35:51] instructed in the word knows
[1:35:53] this is the coming of the lord it ought
[1:35:55] to be a glorious jubilee to the
[1:35:56] christians to know that the end is not
[1:35:59] and brother branham was criticized he
[1:36:00] said someone said unto me not long ago
[1:36:02] you scare the people when you talk about
[1:36:04] it might be the next hour
[1:36:07] you scare the people he said scare the
[1:36:11] people what people
[1:36:13] he said not his people
[1:36:16] no he said it's the greatest note that
[1:36:18] we can ever sound that's what we're
[1:36:20] looking for behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:36:23] that's what we live for
[1:36:27] we live for the coming of the lord
[1:36:30] what else could you
[1:36:31] be thinking of when the pressure and the
[1:36:34] stress begins to mount up on you what
[1:36:36] else could you be thinking but come
[1:36:38] lower come on
[1:36:41] i know it could be greater nothing
[1:36:43] greater than that hour but to the center
[1:36:45] i know it's a terrible thing
[1:36:48] he said but when the storm is coming
[1:36:49] over a parched land
[1:36:52] you know what i'm talking about
[1:36:53] when you can sense that storm that rain
[1:36:56] is moving across the land that hasn't
[1:36:57] been rained on in a while you begin to
[1:36:59] feel that breeze pick up
[1:37:01] you begin to feel that storm coming and
[1:37:03] you know that the rain is fixing to come
[1:37:05] he said it ought to make you happy to
[1:37:06] breathe because that air is coming the
[1:37:09] rain is coming in that air
[1:37:11] and we're living in an hour when we can
[1:37:13] feel the storm coming
[1:37:16] the storm is all around us but the rain
[1:37:19] is coming
[1:37:20] breathe in the rain
[1:37:28] [Applause]
[1:37:30] spain
[1:37:32] talking about spain here this is not him
[1:37:34] this is something i've researched
[1:37:36] spain led the world in the 15th century
[1:37:40] and on her coins
[1:37:43] she had a little bit of a national
[1:37:44] arrogancy about her
[1:37:46] and she inscribed the the inscription
[1:37:49] knee plus ultra
[1:37:52] which means nothing further
[1:37:55] nothing further meaning that spain
[1:37:57] was the ultimate in all the world
[1:38:00] there was no more greater there was no
[1:38:02] more bigger there was nothing else to
[1:38:03] discover spain had
[1:38:06] it all
[1:38:08] until the discovery of the new world
[1:38:12] and then she realized
[1:38:14] there's more out there
[1:38:17] this is not the end of the world
[1:38:19] so then she began to print her coins and
[1:38:21] she put on there plus ultra which means
[1:38:25] more beyond
[1:38:28] and we think about that put yourself in
[1:38:30] that situation when you as a sinner
[1:38:32] before you came to christ
[1:38:34] there was nothing more than what you
[1:38:36] wanted to but this world there was
[1:38:38] nothing more but when you see the new
[1:38:40] world when you've seen the new way of
[1:38:42] living when you see the new christ
[1:38:45] you begin to look at that and you've
[1:38:46] been said listen there's more out there
[1:38:48] there's more for me
[1:38:50] so if you don't know healing this
[1:38:52] morning there's healing for you
[1:38:55] if you don't know love in your heart
[1:38:56] this morning there's love for you
[1:38:59] if you don't know
[1:39:01] peace in your life and your job in your
[1:39:03] family there's peace for you and more
[1:39:05] importantly if you don't know salvation
[1:39:07] jesus is for you
[1:39:09] there is a cross of calvary
[1:39:11] where you can find yourself down there
[1:39:12] and jesus says i'll give you all that i
[1:39:14] have everything i have is yours
[1:39:26] talking about the some
[1:39:28] christians now let's look at this for a
[1:39:29] minute i'm gonna get to my text
[1:39:31] shortly
[1:39:34] we see brothers and sisters many times
[1:39:37] that the world begins to press down on
[1:39:42] and you can see it like a train coming
[1:39:46] and the world you can see the pressure
[1:39:48] on them
[1:39:50] and you can see it begin to mount upon
[1:39:52] them
[1:39:53] and before you know it
[1:39:55] it presses down on them and you can see
[1:39:57] that they're thinking about throwing in
[1:39:58] the towel
[1:40:00] how many times have you
[1:40:02] seen it that people they get under
[1:40:04] pressure and you begin to pray with them
[1:40:06] you pray for them you go check on them
[1:40:08] you check on you call them and say hey
[1:40:09] how's it going just want to make sure
[1:40:11] everything was going good just keep just
[1:40:13] you know just staying in touch with you
[1:40:15] praying for you
[1:40:17] only to find out a few days later maybe
[1:40:21] they've left the church
[1:40:25] the pressure mounts up on them to a
[1:40:27] place
[1:40:29] that they allow satan to take over
[1:40:33] they allow the the pressures that satan
[1:40:35] and the stress that satan has placed on
[1:40:37] them that they leave the church
[1:40:39] what happens next they walk away from
[1:40:41] their marriage
[1:40:43] they walk away from their kids
[1:40:45] they walk away from their careers
[1:40:50] pressure
[1:40:52] and before you know it they walk away
[1:40:54] from christ completely
[1:40:56] and that's when you can say pressure has
[1:40:59] converted into stress
[1:41:01] that a person that they cannot handle
[1:41:06] there's so much pressure everywhere
[1:41:08] listen
[1:41:09] everybody seems to be under pressure
[1:41:12] what does it
[1:41:14] what's the matter everything a day of
[1:41:16] pressure people are driving through the
[1:41:17] streets 90 miles an hour and getting
[1:41:19] tickets from policemen and run down the
[1:41:21] road almost take a chance on losing
[1:41:23] their life to get five foot in front of
[1:41:25] somebody
[1:41:31] oh boy
[1:41:35] i was driving along just minding my
[1:41:37] business the other day going to
[1:41:39] the hopkinsville
[1:41:41] i was in the lane i was supposed to be
[1:41:43] in
[1:41:44] somebody was beside me nowhere i could
[1:41:46] go
[1:41:47] and this woman out of the blue just
[1:41:49] darts out in front of me like a
[1:41:50] hurricane
[1:41:52] i hit my brakes
[1:41:53] doing 55 it was 55.60
[1:41:56] somewhere in that range
[1:42:00] hit the brakes slow down she darts in
[1:42:02] front of me gets over in the other lane
[1:42:05] pulls up to the light like a i don't
[1:42:07] know what and just i look at her i go
[1:42:08] like this where's your hurry where are
[1:42:11] you going
[1:42:12] the light's red what are you doing i
[1:42:15] thought i better quit she's going to
[1:42:16] pull a gun out and shoot me
[1:42:20] but it's that age of neurotic thinking
[1:42:22] go go go hurry hurry hurry she almost
[1:42:25] caused an accident probably a three or
[1:42:26] four car accident if she would have been
[1:42:28] a fraction of a second sooner i would
[1:42:30] have hit her the car behind me would
[1:42:31] have hit me the one beside me i would
[1:42:33] have probably run into it why all
[1:42:35] because she was in a hurry to leave work
[1:42:37] to go see something that she couldn't
[1:42:39] even get there the light was red
[1:42:46] you say well brother brad isn't going to
[1:42:48] happen to me because i'm a christian
[1:42:52] i'm a christian these kinds of i i
[1:42:55] god won't allow this to happen to me
[1:42:58] let me read you this next quote
[1:43:00] even christians it's bothering them
[1:43:04] did you hear what i said
[1:43:07] that's why i said when i started
[1:43:09] people a lot of times wanted to think he
[1:43:11] was talking about the neurotic people
[1:43:13] around him no he said i have been known
[1:43:16] to be neurotic
[1:43:19] study it up he said i've been known to
[1:43:22] be accused of being neurotic
[1:43:29] thank you
[1:43:31] even christians it's bothering them see
[1:43:33] some of them all pressured up and you
[1:43:36] snap off enough temper built up like
[1:43:38] they're going to blow up what's the
[1:43:40] matter something's wrong it shouldn't be
[1:43:42] that way temper comes from satan
[1:43:49] i like what he says here because they
[1:43:50] can apply it in a couple of ways
[1:43:52] he says everybody's under pressure
[1:43:54] though he says of course i don't believe
[1:43:56] it's in this group here
[1:43:58] he said but you know these meetings are
[1:43:59] being taped so it'll go other places you
[1:44:02] see so i'll be speaking to that group
[1:44:04] that's under pressure
[1:44:07] that was this nice way of saying i'm
[1:44:09] sure none of you can relate to this but
[1:44:12] or it's either his way of saying it's
[1:44:13] not for me it's for us
[1:44:20] but i thought you know
[1:44:22] that kind of bothers all groups pressure
[1:44:25] if satan can get you under pressure he's
[1:44:27] got you whipped
[1:44:29] people are doing things wrong trying to
[1:44:30] hide from it
[1:44:33] oh you're talking about pressure
[1:44:35] you start doing
[1:44:36] things that you know is not right
[1:44:38] and you're trying to hide it you're
[1:44:39] trying to live secret secret sins secret
[1:44:41] things in your life you want to talk
[1:44:43] about pressure that's pressure
[1:44:46] you can't handle that christians are not
[1:44:48] made to live that way
[1:44:49] and the pressure becomes so strong that
[1:44:51] eventually you're gonna have to find
[1:44:53] yourself at an altar and say god forgive
[1:44:55] me for where i'm feeling you because i
[1:44:57] know i'm not supposed to be living this
[1:44:58] way
[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:06] trying to hurry now just because we got
[1:45:08] communion that don't want to take too
[1:45:10] much time but let's look at moses for
[1:45:12] just a few minutes
[1:45:16] thinking about moses i heard preachers
[1:45:17] say one time said
[1:45:19] there's no pressure in pulling the baby
[1:45:21] from the river the pressure came from
[1:45:23] pulling the profit from the baby
[1:45:26] let that sink in for just a second
[1:45:29] there was no pressure from pulling the
[1:45:30] baby from the river the pressure came
[1:45:33] from pulling the profit from the baby
[1:45:36] so it was really easy for her to reach
[1:45:38] down and grab that little basket
[1:45:40] that was the easy part
[1:45:42] hard part was when it began to build up
[1:45:44] and god began to call moses and say
[1:45:46] you're going to be my prophet you're
[1:45:48] going to be my spokesman you're going to
[1:45:50] you're going to be the one that goes
[1:45:51] deliver my people from the hands of
[1:45:53] egypt
[1:45:54] that's when the pressure started
[1:45:56] that's when it become to get real when
[1:45:58] when he began to be called as a prophet
[1:46:01] so here's moses a life full of pressure
[1:46:04] born and raised a hebrew born and raised
[1:46:07] hebrew raised in the house of pharaoh in
[1:46:10] egypt
[1:46:13] you say well he didn't know no different
[1:46:14] i beg to differ
[1:46:16] i think the scripture tells us that
[1:46:17] miriam his sister went got the nurse
[1:46:19] made his mother and he sucked from her
[1:46:22] and she educated him the prophet said
[1:46:24] she taught him who he was
[1:46:27] he knew who he was he knew who he was by
[1:46:30] blood by being raised in the house of an
[1:46:33] egyptian family
[1:46:35] being raised in the house of an egyptian
[1:46:37] family where he is he can never be as
[1:46:39] good as those around him
[1:46:43] he can never be as good as those around
[1:46:45] him but yet he's watching from a young
[1:46:47] boy the past masters
[1:46:50] beat
[1:46:51] and enslave his own kinsmen
[1:46:54] and so here is moses watching this day
[1:46:57] after day after day
[1:47:00] pressure
[1:47:01] can you imagine seeing knowing that your
[1:47:04] blood relatives
[1:47:06] your aunts your uncles your cousins
[1:47:09] your closest people are out there and
[1:47:11] you're watching them be beat day after
[1:47:12] day after day while you eat with a
[1:47:14] silver spoon
[1:47:16] that's pressure
[1:47:19] that's pressure
[1:47:20] and this pressure begins to build up and
[1:47:22] what does moses do he goes and he
[1:47:24] commits murder
[1:47:27] now he's got this on his mind and on his
[1:47:29] heart and he runs out into the
[1:47:31] wilderness to try to escape this
[1:47:32] pressure that he's now under
[1:47:34] and he's escaping this pressure and he's
[1:47:36] going out there in the wilderness and
[1:47:38] god's saying i want you to be my prophet
[1:47:41] i want you to be my servant
[1:47:44] i don't want no part of this god i'm
[1:47:46] just trying to mind my own business
[1:47:51] but there's that calling
[1:47:53] they call and it keeps coming down at
[1:47:55] him and keeps coming back at him
[1:47:57] but god i stutter
[1:48:00] i'm not eloquent in my speech god
[1:48:04] but you're going to be my spokesman
[1:48:08] have you ever tried to get up and give a
[1:48:09] speech
[1:48:13] it's tough
[1:48:17] it's tough
[1:48:19] and have you ever thought about having
[1:48:20] to give a speech and you can't even talk
[1:48:24] that's even tougher
[1:48:27] and the pressure that he's living under
[1:48:28] now
[1:48:30] and his time goes on and on and on now
[1:48:33] he's got the pressure and the task of
[1:48:35] announcing
[1:48:36] to his former palace his former ruler
[1:48:41] he's got the task now of announcing i'm
[1:48:43] going to bring plagues
[1:48:45] upon you
[1:48:48] my god says let my people go
[1:48:52] or there will be plague after plague
[1:48:55] after plague and judgment of death on
[1:48:57] you pharaoh
[1:49:02] we think we got pressure
[1:49:06] they leave
[1:49:08] out of egypt
[1:49:10] all is well now right everything's good
[1:49:12] man we're going to the promised land
[1:49:14] we're right on the edge of the rapture
[1:49:16] everything's good right
[1:49:19] where did this red sea come from
[1:49:24] where is this army i hear them coming
[1:49:26] what is not supposed to be this way god
[1:49:28] you didn't tell me this was in the
[1:49:29] playbook
[1:49:32] pressure
[1:49:34] he's got two million people standing
[1:49:36] behind him saying moses what have you
[1:49:38] done
[1:49:40] you want to talk about a boss with a
[1:49:41] bunch of angry employees
[1:49:46] moses what have you done
[1:49:50] and under the pressure of the people he
[1:49:52] begins to seek out god
[1:49:54] and finds himself with his hands raised
[1:49:56] up and the waters part
[1:49:58] all is well right the army's gone
[1:50:00] they've been defeated miriam's dancing
[1:50:02] with the tambourine she's having a good
[1:50:04] old time on the other side life is grand
[1:50:11] but the people begin to complain
[1:50:14] about their hardships
[1:50:19] and the lord hears their anger
[1:50:24] in numbers it tells us in numbers 11 it
[1:50:27] says then the mixed
[1:50:29] who were traveling with the israelites
[1:50:30] began to crave good things of egypt
[1:50:33] and then the people of israel also began
[1:50:35] to complain
[1:50:37] did you ever notice it was the mixed
[1:50:42] yeah they weren't all they were all
[1:50:44] believers
[1:50:46] two million people they weren't all
[1:50:48] believers
[1:50:49] it was as the mixed begin to stir it up
[1:50:53] the mix to begin to get in there amongst
[1:50:55] the believers
[1:50:57] and encourage the israelites to hey we
[1:50:59] need to put some heat on moses hey moses
[1:51:02] we remember what it was like to eat fish
[1:51:05] in egypt
[1:51:07] hey moses we remember what it was like
[1:51:10] to have cucumbers and melons and leeks
[1:51:12] and vegetables and we we ate good we had
[1:51:14] onions and garlic we had all we wanted
[1:51:17] we remember that moses
[1:51:21] but now we don't even have an appetite
[1:51:23] because we've gone without food for so
[1:51:25] long
[1:51:27] complaining
[1:51:29] the pressures
[1:51:30] of the complainers
[1:51:34] they're an area of the country where
[1:51:35] there's nothing but granite and rocks
[1:51:37] and
[1:51:38] desert no vegetation
[1:51:41] the mixed
[1:51:42] crowd
[1:51:44] you know the mixed crowd
[1:51:47] pretending to be
[1:51:49] believers
[1:51:52] believers make believers non-believers
[1:51:56] and here they were the mix in the crowd
[1:51:59] tagging along for the ride
[1:52:03] they can't handle the pressures of egypt
[1:52:08] no they can't handle the pressures
[1:52:09] that's coming on of leaving the exile of
[1:52:12] of egypt
[1:52:13] they wasn't built for that but they're
[1:52:14] just tagging along
[1:52:16] and you know they're that you see that
[1:52:18] around the message too
[1:52:21] you see that around the message these
[1:52:22] people just hang along the message but
[1:52:24] you never really see them devoted you
[1:52:26] never really see them committed you
[1:52:28] never really see them really giving it
[1:52:29] their all you know we're all going to
[1:52:31] make mistakes we're all going to fall
[1:52:34] but i'm going to give it all
[1:52:36] are you with me
[1:52:39] give it your all you may fall flat on
[1:52:41] your face and you may not even make it
[1:52:42] but go down fight
[1:52:45] give it all you've got to make into that
[1:52:47] rapture but you see these people they
[1:52:49] just hang along
[1:52:52] and you know the funny thing about it is
[1:52:54] we're all pretty much equal in church
[1:53:00] we're all listening we're all amen and
[1:53:02] we're all
[1:53:03] having a good time
[1:53:06] we all thinking about god we all singing
[1:53:08] songs of zion and victory
[1:53:12] but the tagalongs
[1:53:15] something changes about them when they
[1:53:17] walk out the doors
[1:53:21] it's no longer songs of victory
[1:53:26] it's other kinds of songs
[1:53:29] it's no longer songs uh uh words of
[1:53:32] encouragement
[1:53:33] it's words of defeat
[1:53:36] it's no longer
[1:53:38] thoughts of pressing forward but it's
[1:53:40] negativity
[1:53:42] they become the murmurers the rumor
[1:53:44] spreaders the complainers
[1:53:47] moses had them
[1:53:48] [Music]
[1:53:50] yeah we're going to have them too
[1:53:52] and you wonder sometimes while the
[1:53:54] pastor's under so much pressure
[1:53:56] oh you don't see it
[1:53:59] you don't see it most of the time
[1:54:01] because god builds him different
[1:54:06] they're built to handle the pressure
[1:54:10] [Music]
[1:54:11] moses experienced this
[1:54:13] miraculous power of god in delivering
[1:54:16] the children of israel
[1:54:17] and now in the desert moses is
[1:54:19] experiencing this conflict and
[1:54:21] complaints
[1:54:23] so brother sisters no matter where
[1:54:24] you're at in your life whatever walk
[1:54:26] you're in we're always going to have
[1:54:28] these complaints
[1:54:30] we're always going to have circumstances
[1:54:31] we're always going to have tribulation
[1:54:33] we're going to have sorrow that's what
[1:54:34] our scripture said when we started
[1:54:36] didn't it it said jesus said as long as
[1:54:37] we live in this world we face
[1:54:39] tribulation and sorrow
[1:54:42] you know what it said at the first of it
[1:54:43] it said you might have peace
[1:54:50] might be peaceful but i guarantee you
[1:54:52] you'll have tribulation
[1:54:54] and you'll have sorrow
[1:54:56] so moses is being tested continually by
[1:54:59] this stress oh day after day after day
[1:55:01] after day and he finally comes to a
[1:55:03] place and he comes to god under the
[1:55:05] pressure of the people
[1:55:09] and he says god i cannot carry these
[1:55:11] people by myself
[1:55:13] the load is too
[1:55:15] far heavy he said i'd rather you just
[1:55:18] kill me and take me out of my misery
[1:55:22] pressure
[1:55:25] pressure
[1:55:27] moses finds himself in a worn out
[1:55:30] beat down burned out depressed exalted
[1:55:33] ready to give up state of mind
[1:55:38] and god says you know what moses
[1:55:41] i want you to recruit 70 men that'll
[1:55:43] help you out
[1:55:47] moses didn't just
[1:55:49] jump and say i quit i give up i'm
[1:55:52] walking away
[1:55:54] because so many times people do that
[1:55:57] i've had all i can take i'm done with
[1:55:59] this i'm walking away i never want to
[1:56:00] see this again i never want to go back
[1:56:02] to church i never want to be around
[1:56:04] people i never want you know brother
[1:56:06] brown said i wanna just go up in the
[1:56:07] mountains and be a trapper and god
[1:56:09] what was that that was pressure on the
[1:56:12] prophet
[1:56:15] god's man for the hour and we think
[1:56:17] we're so we're not subject to that kind
[1:56:19] of pressure
[1:56:24] but whenever we find ourselves drained
[1:56:26] it's good for us just and physically
[1:56:28] exhausted it's good don't make a major
[1:56:30] decision
[1:56:32] i found out if i if i need to make a
[1:56:34] decision i'm under a lot of pressure
[1:56:35] it's best if i just kind of
[1:56:38] [Applause]
[1:56:40] stop and catch my breath
[1:56:43] wives
[1:56:48] be patient with your husbands when
[1:56:49] there's decisions to be made
[1:56:53] because it's easy for you to say what
[1:56:54] are we going to do what are we going to
[1:56:56] do what are you going to do
[1:56:58] what should we do how are we going to
[1:57:00] handle this
[1:57:03] give them time to breathe
[1:57:05] give them time to pray
[1:57:07] give them give give god time to send 70
[1:57:10] workers to come and help
[1:57:13] give to god time to
[1:57:15] smooth out the situation where you can
[1:57:17] make a sound decision
[1:57:23] so god
[1:57:24] they begin to complain
[1:57:29] we're hungry we want meat
[1:57:31] i'm sick and tired of this man
[1:57:34] we want some meat give me some steak
[1:57:38] moses says god i don't know what to do
[1:57:39] with these people
[1:57:41] i i don't know i don't know how to
[1:57:43] handle these people
[1:57:46] so god says
[1:57:48] i'll send you meat
[1:57:50] more than you will ever eat
[1:57:54] see sometimes we just have to go to god
[1:57:55] and say god
[1:57:57] i don't know what i'm
[1:57:58] gonna do
[1:58:00] i don't know how to handle this pressure
[1:58:02] i don't know how to handle this
[1:58:04] situation but i know you're a provider
[1:58:07] so out of the blue
[1:58:09] quail begins to flutter
[1:58:11] about three feet high where they can
[1:58:13] just walk and pick the quail can you
[1:58:14] imagine walking pick and quail like
[1:58:16] you're picking corn
[1:58:18] and they eat so much quail they have it
[1:58:20] just left over and left over they don't
[1:58:22] know what they have so much meat
[1:58:26] but
[1:58:28] their bellies are full
[1:58:31] they're happy they're content we're
[1:58:32] always content when our bellies are full
[1:58:34] aren't we
[1:58:36] yeah yeah you can be you can be hungry
[1:58:40] man you can be hungry
[1:58:43] but you get a little food in you
[1:58:45] hunger's gone you're content you're
[1:58:47] happy
[1:58:49] but that didn't end for moses
[1:58:51] poor guy
[1:58:53] who does he come from next
[1:58:55] miriam
[1:58:57] and aaron his own flesh and blood
[1:59:01] miriam and aaron come to him and say
[1:59:03] moses
[1:59:05] we're a little bit upset with you
[1:59:07] your wife just died
[1:59:09] and now you go and you marry an
[1:59:11] ethiopian of a dark-skinned tribe that's
[1:59:14] not even of us critical
[1:59:18] criticizing everything he does
[1:59:22] most of the time you know what i found
[1:59:24] what why people criticize
[1:59:27] what is it
[1:59:28] jealousy they were jealous of moses they
[1:59:31] were jealous of his power they were
[1:59:33] jealous of his authority
[1:59:35] they were jealous of what god was doing
[1:59:37] in his life and so they wanted to try to
[1:59:39] find anything that they could nitpick
[1:59:41] and tear apart
[1:59:47] we have to learn as christians to be
[1:59:48] kind of
[1:59:50] easy
[1:59:51] going
[1:59:54] because your worst critics
[1:59:56] are going to come from those around you
[2:00:06] criticism
[2:00:08] from blood
[2:00:11] it's tough
[2:00:14] that's your brothers that's your sisters
[2:00:15] i'm glad i'm
[2:00:20] criticism
[2:00:22] is tough
[2:00:24] it's easy too to be on the other side of
[2:00:26] that and be the criticizer
[2:00:29] and before you know it you don't even
[2:00:30] realize but you're putting more pressure
[2:00:32] on people who's already under pressure
[2:00:36] there's a story i read in a book
[2:00:39] um
[2:00:42] in the book by stephen covey it's called
[2:00:44] seven habits of highly effective people
[2:00:47] has anybody ever read it
[2:00:49] i figured brother joe had brother josh
[2:00:51] has but he tells a story in there and he
[2:00:54] tells the story of a man who's has his
[2:00:56] children aboard the new york subway and
[2:00:59] the children were loud and they're
[2:01:00] boisterous and they're disruptive and
[2:01:02] they're running everywhere and they're
[2:01:03] sitting beside uh stephen covey and and
[2:01:07] he says this man is oblivious to his
[2:01:09] children's behavior he's just letting
[2:01:11] them go wild on there and he says mr
[2:01:14] cobby says finally i said sir your
[2:01:16] children are disturbing everyone
[2:01:19] i wonder if you can control them a
[2:01:20] little more and the man looked at covey
[2:01:23] and said oh you're right
[2:01:26] said i i guess i should do something
[2:01:27] about it we just came from the hospital
[2:01:30] where their mother died about an hour
[2:01:32] ago
[2:01:32] said i don't know what to think and i
[2:01:34] guess they don't know how to handle it
[2:01:36] either
[2:01:38] you're talking about a humbling
[2:01:40] experience
[2:01:42] mr covey said his his attitude changed
[2:01:45] dramatically he said he learned a
[2:01:46] valuable lesson to seek to understand
[2:01:49] before seeking to be understood
[2:01:54] know somebody's situation before you're
[2:01:56] the one pouring fire pouring gas on the
[2:01:59] fire
[2:02:01] put yourself in somebody else's shoes
[2:02:03] this man was under so much pressure
[2:02:05] because he just lost his wife he didn't
[2:02:06] even realize that his children were
[2:02:08] running erratic
[2:02:15] people began to pressure moses now this
[2:02:18] is where we have to be careful
[2:02:21] we're going to have pressure
[2:02:23] are we all in agreeance of that
[2:02:27] people begin to pressure moses
[2:02:29] we need water
[2:02:31] we need water and the lord told moses
[2:02:34] moses go and strike the rock to produce
[2:02:36] the water
[2:02:37] and just like god told him moses strikes
[2:02:40] the rock
[2:02:41] and the water flows through and
[2:02:42] everybody's happy everybody's content
[2:02:44] everybody's thirst is quenched they're
[2:02:47] ready to go on they're happy it's
[2:02:48] flowing in abundance
[2:02:51] then in numbers in the book of numbers
[2:02:53] we see the same situation moses we need
[2:02:56] water moses we're thirsty moses we're
[2:02:59] gonna die
[2:03:02] now you keep in mind right now that
[2:03:03] moses is at a later age in his life he's
[2:03:06] dealing with second generation of these
[2:03:09] uh
[2:03:10] people that's in the in the mixed
[2:03:14] he's dealing with a younger generation
[2:03:17] of people
[2:03:18] he's dealing with the the people that
[2:03:19] are the age of joshua and caleb and
[2:03:21] those younger people
[2:03:23] some of the older ones have done died
[2:03:24] off he's up in age you know they say
[2:03:26] there's a reason that that people have
[2:03:28] kids when they're young and not when
[2:03:29] they're old
[2:03:33] because older people can't handle the
[2:03:35] pressures of kids
[2:03:38] sometimes i wonder how i do
[2:03:43] but moses is an older man now he's
[2:03:45] dealing with these people coming at him
[2:03:47] day after day we want water we want
[2:03:49] water we want water
[2:03:51] and god tells moses moses just speak to
[2:03:54] the
[2:03:54] rock and as he's going to go to the rock
[2:03:58] he was going to the rock of salvation
[2:04:01] and the people are constantly most we
[2:04:03] need water we need water we know the
[2:04:05] water here take your water
[2:04:13] what did stress do for moses
[2:04:18] there's consequences
[2:04:21] when we're under stress
[2:04:24] god said speak to the rock
[2:04:27] he didn't say smite it
[2:04:29] you can't smite that rock twice
[2:04:32] because the rock died once and for all
[2:04:36] the rock jesus christ was smitten once
[2:04:40] not to be hit again and the bible tells
[2:04:43] us when we teach it i think it's in
[2:04:44] corinthians that the representation of
[2:04:46] moses in the wilderness that rock was
[2:04:48] christ
[2:04:49] and because moses disobeyed under the
[2:04:52] pressure
[2:04:54] because he disobeyed what god told him
[2:04:57] he broke the whole
[2:04:59] continuity of the bible
[2:05:02] and because of that he says moses
[2:05:06] you cannot enter in
[2:05:09] to the promised land
[2:05:12] this journey's been on for your entire
[2:05:14] life
[2:05:17] it ends
[2:05:18] today you can't smite my rock
[2:05:26] brothers and sisters that scene was just
[2:05:29] a witness of a stressed out prophet
[2:05:34] moses had all he could handle and he
[2:05:36] lost it
[2:05:37] he had all he could handle he lost that
[2:05:39] he blew up and he missed entering into
[2:05:41] that promised land if moses would have
[2:05:43] just slowed down
[2:05:45] it's a people
[2:05:49] just give me just a second
[2:05:52] we'll have water
[2:05:54] i promise he's never failed us he's
[2:05:56] never let us down just give me just a
[2:05:58] minute
[2:05:59] water
[2:06:01] come forth
[2:06:03] he would have stepped right into the
[2:06:04] promised land
[2:06:11] brothers and sisters a lot of times we
[2:06:12] beat things
[2:06:14] when all we have to do is speak to the
[2:06:16] rock
[2:06:18] if we can learn and teach and train
[2:06:19] ourselves to when things are going hard
[2:06:22] and pressures on and things are going
[2:06:23] against us i just need to go see the
[2:06:25] rock
[2:06:29] i just need to go
[2:06:35] there was a story i read about a state
[2:06:37] trooper
[2:06:38] he was awarded an outstanding trooper
[2:06:40] award
[2:06:42] the governor award the war told him said
[2:06:45] you've been a trooper for 15 years
[2:06:47] and you haven't once roughed up a drunk
[2:06:50] or used excessive force on anyone
[2:06:53] how can you be a state trooper for 15
[2:06:55] years dealing with the kind of stuff you
[2:06:56] deal with and have that happen
[2:06:59] and the trooper responded well
[2:07:01] there's two things
[2:07:04] first if i'm called to break up a fight
[2:07:06] at a tavern i never say to myself
[2:07:08] there's a drunk
[2:07:09] i always say to myself there's a man
[2:07:13] someone's husband someone's son
[2:07:16] someone's neighbor who got drunk
[2:07:19] he said so i always try to think of him
[2:07:21] as a man
[2:07:22] and not a crime
[2:07:26] that's pretty good wisdom
[2:07:28] and he says secondly the bible says that
[2:07:30] a soft answer turns away wrath
[2:07:35] he said so whenever i walk up to the
[2:07:37] window of an automobile i always speak a
[2:07:40] little lower than the person i'm
[2:07:41] speaking to
[2:07:44] that's pretty good wisdom
[2:07:48] we can take control of the situations in
[2:07:50] our life if we would just slow down
[2:07:53] and don't let the pressure build into
[2:07:55] such a place that we can't handle it
[2:07:59] but let me tell you this we all
[2:08:02] can be a little rough around the edges
[2:08:04] right
[2:08:05] but have you ever heard the saying the
[2:08:07] person is a diamond in the rough
[2:08:11] yeah we're all diamond in the rough
[2:08:15] and the story of the diamond is that the
[2:08:17] diamond is the conditions surrounding
[2:08:19] the diamond they're formed under precise
[2:08:21] and intense conditions
[2:08:23] that diamond needs to be both under very
[2:08:25] high temperature
[2:08:26] and it has to be under strong pressure
[2:08:30] to become a diamond
[2:08:32] so sometimes god has to turn the heat up
[2:08:35] in our lives a little bit
[2:08:37] god has to put the pressure down on your
[2:08:39] life just a little bit
[2:08:41] so that you can find yourself able to to
[2:08:43] turn yourself from from just a rough
[2:08:45] piece of carbon into a shining sparkling
[2:08:48] gem of a diamond
[2:08:50] that diamond says it says it has to
[2:08:53] endure and duress
[2:08:55] 725 000 pounds per square inch of
[2:08:59] pressure at 2 000 to 2200 degrees
[2:09:02] fahrenheit
[2:09:04] that's pressure
[2:09:06] that's heat
[2:09:14] be of good
[2:09:16] cheer i have overcome the world
[2:09:25] knowing that jesus has overcome the
[2:09:27] world
[2:09:28] should bring us good cheer
[2:09:32] knowing that someday there will be no
[2:09:34] more pressure
[2:09:35] should bring us good cheer
[2:09:38] knowing that someday there will never be
[2:09:40] another
[2:09:41] a squabble another cross word
[2:09:44] with your husband with your wife
[2:09:46] with your boss with your brother with
[2:09:48] your sister
[2:09:51] that'll bring good cheer
[2:09:53] how can we how can that be because he
[2:09:54] says i have overcome
[2:09:57] the world
[2:10:00] want to leave you with one last
[2:10:01] illustration here as we before we turn
[2:10:03] the service back
[2:10:06] when a person dives under water
[2:10:10] we've probably all been swimming
[2:10:11] sometime if you can swim you've tried to
[2:10:13] go as deep as you can and you know
[2:10:15] everybody wants to go set on the pool
[2:10:16] bottom right
[2:10:17] you try to get down there and set the
[2:10:19] bottom
[2:10:20] but when you dive into water at about 10
[2:10:23] to 12 feet you begin to feel that
[2:10:25] physical pressure of the force on your
[2:10:26] body right
[2:10:28] you feel your ears begin to
[2:10:31] pop they begin to hurt you can feel your
[2:10:33] pressure on your face you can feel it
[2:10:35] just kind of pressing in on you
[2:10:37] and for somebody for the untrained
[2:10:39] person you can go probably about 15 feet
[2:10:41] deep and that's probably all you're
[2:10:42] going to want
[2:10:44] about 15 feet because it's going to
[2:10:46] start getting really uncomfortable
[2:10:49] but you know there's people that's
[2:10:50] trained to do what's called free diving
[2:10:54] and what these free divers do they go
[2:10:56] out into the ocean into the depths of
[2:10:57] the ocean they drop a cable
[2:11:00] down into the bottom
[2:11:02] maybe a thousand feet deep
[2:11:05] then they get right there at the edge of
[2:11:07] the boat
[2:11:09] they grab onto a weight a sled they call
[2:11:11] it and it runs down that cable
[2:11:14] and they take one deep breath
[2:11:17] and jump in
[2:11:18] and let that weight take them as far as
[2:11:20] they can stand it
[2:11:22] the world record is 705 feet deep on one
[2:11:26] breath
[2:11:28] the pressure is immense
[2:11:31] and it happens quick the pressure is so
[2:11:33] immense on the body that they say the
[2:11:36] cluster you know your lungs are made up
[2:11:37] of like like say a cluster of grapes
[2:11:40] your lungs compress so tight that that
[2:11:43] their lung actually comes becomes the
[2:11:45] size of grapes
[2:11:47] these two big old pieces of lung tissue
[2:11:49] that you take in full breaths with the
[2:11:52] compression comes down down that's how
[2:11:54] they can go so deep because the pressure
[2:11:56] there so when they reach the bottom and
[2:11:57] they reach down to 500 600 700 foot deep
[2:12:00] they let go of that weighted sled they
[2:12:02] grab a hold of another one break it
[2:12:04] loose it's a balloon that takes them
[2:12:05] right back to the surface as fast as
[2:12:07] they went back as fast as they went down
[2:12:08] they go up
[2:12:10] and their lungs begin to expand
[2:12:14] there's limitations in that kind of
[2:12:16] pressure diving
[2:12:19] but how many has ever heard of a
[2:12:20] submarine
[2:12:23] a submarine dives in a little bit of a
[2:12:26] different condition
[2:12:27] the submarines can go down there it's
[2:12:29] full of men it's full of people it's
[2:12:31] they're working and some of these
[2:12:32] submarines go to some of the deepest
[2:12:34] depths of the ocean some of them 10 000
[2:12:36] one of them i seen even 35 000 feet deep
[2:12:44] how can they do that
[2:12:46] how you how can that how can it not just
[2:12:48] crush upon itself like the lungs of a
[2:12:51] person
[2:12:52] you know how it does it because they add
[2:12:54] pressure from the inside
[2:12:58] and that pressurized cabin begins to
[2:13:00] push out against the pressure on the
[2:13:02] inside
[2:13:03] and that's what we have to do if we're
[2:13:04] going to combat the pressures of this
[2:13:06] world we have to have more jesus on the
[2:13:08] inside
[2:13:10] pressing against the outside so that we
[2:13:12] can say i can endure any pressure satan
[2:13:15] puts upon me
[2:13:18] we need to pressurize ourselves with god
[2:13:22] pressurize ourselves with prayer
[2:13:24] pressurize ourself with the word of god
[2:13:27] pressurize ourselves with songs of zion
[2:13:30] victory and overcome and pressurize
[2:13:32] ourselves with fellowship of believers
[2:13:38] you love the lord this morning
[2:13:41] god's certainly good to us don't get
[2:13:44] discouraged with the pressures of life
[2:13:46] but see how you can apply some of the
[2:13:48] things that were said today to overcome
[2:13:50] these pressures
[2:13:51] and find yourself walking closer to go
[2:13:53] pressurizing yourself against the tolls
[2:13:56] against the pressure and the weight and
[2:13:58] the stress of the world and when it
[2:13:59] comes on it comes on strong just take a
[2:14:01] deep breath
[2:14:06] god is in control
[2:14:09] speak to the rock
[2:14:12] let's stand brother byler if you'd like
[2:14:14] to come for communion
[2:14:39] that was good amen
[2:14:41] i like that illustration i never really
[2:14:44] understood but
[2:14:45] they said uh pressurized cabin for
[2:14:48] going in the air and i'm like
[2:14:49] pressurized
[2:14:50] you know but i think i understand after
[2:14:52] the morning
[2:14:53] you build a little pressure from the
[2:14:55] inside out
[2:14:56] amen how many needs more of that in your
[2:14:57] life to your lord jesus and i know one
[2:15:00] thing's for us as we go on through time
[2:15:01] we're going to need more of it
[2:15:03] amen have to count counter pressure amen
[2:15:06] that's power heads and close your eyes
[2:15:08] lord jesus we want to thank you father
[2:15:10] for the wonderful word
[2:15:12] that you have brought to us lord this
[2:15:13] morning father that we can take home
[2:15:15] that we can
[2:15:16] lord jesus digest lord jesus and let it
[2:15:18] become a part of us lord jesus and we
[2:15:20] just ask now father as we want to honor
[2:15:22] you as you have asked us to honor you
[2:15:24] lord in remembrance lord of what you did
[2:15:26] on calvary lord jesus and given as a way
[2:15:29] of escape from the different pressures
[2:15:32] lord jesus to run into christ lord in
[2:15:33] the cleft of the rock and be safe lord
[2:15:36] but we want to honor you this morning
[2:15:37] with communion the lord and we ask god
[2:15:39] that you just bless every portion of it
[2:15:42] father and as we partake of it to think
[2:15:43] of you lord jesus what you did for us on
[2:15:45] calvary how did you purchased everything
[2:15:48] that we ever have need of lord jesus and
[2:15:50] making us a part of you and give us an
[2:15:52] inheritance in you lord through the
[2:15:54] cross
[2:15:55] we ask god their blessing upon it not in
[2:15:57] jesus christ's name
[2:15:59] amen and amen turn your bibles if you
[2:16:01] will we will do one
