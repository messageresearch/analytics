[52:44] hey man it's good to be the house Lord
[52:46] isn't it
[52:48] where would you want to be
[52:50] there's no place else I'd want to be
[52:52] than to be found at the poster Duty when
[52:54] Christ comes back
[52:56] wouldn't that be great to we're
[52:58] rejoicing in his name
[53:00] singing praises to Him thinking about
[53:02] all the things that he's done for us and
[53:04] Christ comes back oh that would be a
[53:06] tremendous thing for that to happen
[53:08] right now and we're so close
[53:11] it's it could happen this morning
[53:15] it could happen 10 years from now but I
[53:17] don't see that but you know what I never
[53:19] thought that we'd see 2023 either
[53:22] I am amazed that we're here but it's all
[53:25] in God's hands and the only thing I want
[53:27] to be doing is just getting deeper and
[53:29] deeper in the love of Jesus
[53:32] that's where I want to go if you would
[53:34] let's turn in our Bibles while we're
[53:36] standing
[53:36] let's go to Acts chapter one
[53:39] I love getting into his word
[53:41] I love reading his word and one of the
[53:44] things I always
[53:45] Pray
[53:47] when I'm out here or even when I'm by
[53:50] myself I'm always like
[53:51] because if you're excited
[53:53] you'll go back and you can't wait to get
[53:55] back to it
[53:56] but if you're not into it you'll fall
[53:58] asleep reading I've done it you your
[54:01] mind will start one
[54:03] pondering
[54:06] so I always pray Lord make me excited
[54:10] about what I'm reading mix something pop
[54:12] out to me amen Acts chapter 1
[54:17] . let's talk with first
[54:25] until the day in which he was taken up
[54:27] after that he through the Holy Ghost had
[54:31] given Commandments into the apostles
[54:32] whom he had chosen verse 3 to whom also
[54:35] he showed himself alive after his
[54:38] Passion by many infallible proofs being
[54:40] seen numbers for and being a sin making
[54:43] the scripture personal
[54:45] right now amen commanded them that they
[54:49] should not depart from Jerusalem
[54:52] but wait for the promise of the Father
[54:54] which
[54:55] says
[54:57] T yeh
[55:02] verse 5 and for John truly baptized many
[55:05] days hence I like to speak wait until
[55:09] that's our heads
[55:12] precious Heavenly Father
[55:14] Lord we're asking you Lord once more
[55:16] Lord to come down and
[55:18] no
[55:19] what's your word
[55:21] Lord once more make us exciting Lord
[55:24] make us at the edge of our sea
[55:26] anticipating to hear from you Lord we'd
[55:28] love to see our brothers and sisters but
[55:30] our main objective is to see you and to
[55:33] hear from you and Lord we
[55:36] ask you to open up your word to US Open
[55:39] up our ears open up our hearts to
[55:40] receive Lord me included Lord because
[55:44] every time we speak Lord It's you spot
[55:46] speaking to all of us let me just be a
[55:48] microphone
[55:49] Lord that you can speak through we ask
[55:51] this in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[55:55] you may be seated
[55:57] amen
[55:59] so
[56:01] I've always I've read them many many
[56:03] times and I love it when Small Things
[56:05] pop out at you because you know that
[56:08] they
[56:09] waited until in the upper room you know
[56:11] they heard this and I always thought
[56:13] okay that's where they waited but that's
[56:15] not where Jesus told him to wait in the
[56:18] upper room I thought they stayed there
[56:19] the whole time
[56:21] that's not what it says it says that
[56:23] they should not depart from Jerusalem
[56:26] doesn't say stay in one building that
[56:28] says stay in Jerusalem okay so when you
[56:31] look at Jerusalem
[56:32] you know because you know back then they
[56:34] didn't have you're talking they didn't
[56:36] act he didn't actually tell him it's
[56:37] gonna be 10 days it just happened to be
[56:38] 10 days because they had to eat you know
[56:40] that's a long time to fast you had to go
[56:42] to the bathroom they didn't have indoor
[56:44] plumbing
[56:45] that it's actually Jesus
[56:48] it is the Prince of Peace the city of
[56:50] peace and so if you take it to us now
[56:53] the promise here was to be baptized with
[56:55] the Holy Ghost your promise you could
[56:57] already have the Holy Ghost but it could
[56:58] be your healing it could be your healing
[57:01] your salvation for your loved ones it
[57:02] could be you wait in Jesus
[57:06] until
[57:08] that's where our rest is that's where
[57:10] our pieces that's where everything that
[57:12] we have it's in Jesus
[57:15] and
[57:17] then when that promise speaks to you you
[57:20] wait until you get it and we are in a
[57:23] microwave age
[57:24] you gotta can't wait somebody had a
[57:26] stoplight that you're behind it turns
[57:28] green and they sit there for two seconds
[57:32] baby you know you want to like come on
[57:34] it's green
[57:35] but we have to wait until there's
[57:37] there's patience you know when you go to
[57:39] a restaurant where's my food
[57:42] just wait until it's in we have to the
[57:46] patience it's it stretches from from
[57:49] spiritual to Natural
[57:53] and the more that you are like Jesus
[57:55] this the more that you or your patients
[57:58] will just be an ending they will have
[58:01] days
[58:03] we're irritable we'll have days that we
[58:05] we aren't patient as we need to be
[58:07] but that's
[58:09] why we come back and say Lord forgive me
[58:11] Lord help me to be more like you and and
[58:15] that's why there's there's one true
[58:17] feeling but there's many refillings
[58:19] along the way and Lord help us to keep
[58:21] going back for that refill and wait
[58:22] until you
[58:24] yeah
[58:25] refilling
[58:28] whatever
[58:30] um you know our Our Lives because we do
[58:32] collect things that shouldn't be here
[58:33] but that's where the Lord will have
[58:36] mercy and Grace on us and say hey
[58:39] clean that up
[58:41] do this do that sharpen that
[58:46] if the very first that doesn't know that
[58:48] but that's why it was where Melchizedek
[58:51] was the king of exact same city and we
[58:54] know who machesadic was so that's Jesus
[58:57] Jesus stay in peace amen this is uh
[59:01] uh from you don't need to turn here if
[59:03] you want to it's a Revelations 11 8.
[59:05] I'll just kind of paraphrase it
[59:07] it's also from where the brand talks
[59:09] about an epistle it says in their bodies
[59:11] shall lie in the street of that great
[59:13] City
[59:14] spiritually called Sodom and Egypt
[59:18] now that's talking about Jerusalem in
[59:22] Revelations where their bodies are
[59:23] laying that and it's calls that
[59:25] spiritually speaking
[59:27] it says it's
[59:29] um Sodom and Egypt now how can the city
[59:33] of peace
[59:34] be named spiritually speaking
[59:39] Sodom and Egypt
[59:40] look at our church
[59:42] es today
[59:45] spiritually speaking the Great
[59:48] now
[59:49] I want to say that we as a message
[59:51] Church aren't exempt from that
[59:54] we we got to stay on fire we got to keep
[59:57] our lands trimmed
[59:59] otherwise we're just going about the
[1:00:01] emotions we don't want to go about them
[1:00:03] the Motions we want we want to be on
[1:00:05] fire I don't want to be called
[1:00:08] spiritually
[1:00:10] Sodom
[1:00:12] and and eat I I don't want that I want
[1:00:15] to be known as this as the the Church of
[1:00:17] the Living God and and we are the Church
[1:00:19] of the the temple we are the temple and
[1:00:22] wherever we go I love it no matter
[1:00:24] wherever I travel you can feel the same
[1:00:27] spirit because it's Jesus here as it is
[1:00:30] in Indiana is it in Pennsylvania it's in
[1:00:32] Arizona it doesn't matter it's Jesus and
[1:00:36] why is it because you bring him
[1:00:38] is not this feeling
[1:00:40] it's just says pray the Lord for a
[1:00:42] building to give us to come worship out
[1:00:44] of the snow and the rain
[1:00:46] he answers on but you are the building
[1:00:49] they they could close down this church
[1:00:52] and we could still have church at
[1:00:54] somebody's house in somebody's garage we
[1:00:57] are the building oh it's a tremendous
[1:01:00] thing Lord help us and you know you may
[1:01:03] only have a little lick of fire well I'm
[1:01:05] insignificant Satan will tell you all
[1:01:07] kinds of things but you join your look
[1:01:10] of fire with so you're like a fire and
[1:01:12] you're looking fire and all these like a
[1:01:14] fires come together what a fire we have
[1:01:19] but you know what we gotta join together
[1:01:22] that's why it says to one another
[1:01:24] we actually give each other comp
[1:01:26] etence and and I
[1:01:29] love to hear testimonism and people will
[1:01:31] be like well it's such a small thing no
[1:01:33] it's not a small thing
[1:01:36] because if God did that small thing for
[1:01:38] you then he could do the same thing to
[1:01:40] me and oh if he did that big thing for
[1:01:42] you well he can do the big thing for me
[1:01:44] we we actually like each other on fire
[1:01:48] okay
[1:01:50] and and and the fire spreads you know it
[1:01:54] does it it goes from one to the other to
[1:01:56] the other don't
[1:01:58] every service he's here
[1:02:01] the potential is unlimited
[1:02:05] whatever the Lord wants
[1:02:08] that's what we want but I want to be
[1:02:10] pleasing to the king oh the Lord help us
[1:02:13] to be
[1:02:14] pleasing to the king
[1:02:17] amen now
[1:02:19] New Jerusalem when we get to over and
[1:02:23] the other side knew Jerusalem is going
[1:02:25] to be spiritually and naturally the city
[1:02:28] of Peace because it's with Jesus and
[1:02:32] that's where we're heading but you
[1:02:33] realize that you are the New Jerusalem
[1:02:35] now because it said I saw his City
[1:02:38] coming down and it wasn't buildings he
[1:02:40] saw it coming down it was us it's all
[1:02:44] coming down and so if we have Jesus in
[1:02:46] her now we are New Jerusalem now
[1:02:50] and I can't wait to get to the other
[1:02:52] side it's going to be such a we don't we
[1:02:54] don't know what we're going to see here
[1:02:56] remember when the uh when they were
[1:02:58] talking to job and he says where were
[1:03:00] you when the sons and a dollar shouted
[1:03:01] for Joy can you
[1:03:03] come on imagine
[1:03:07] hearing that shout for Joy have you ever
[1:03:09] been in a stadium ball game stadium and
[1:03:13] you hear somebody score a goal and
[1:03:14] everybody
[1:03:15] can you imagine this is not to some
[1:03:19] worthless game this is our life and
[1:03:24] we're gonna be you know that's where all
[1:03:25] heavens and earth heard me scream
[1:03:28] team
[1:03:30] because I
[1:03:33] Jesus is Lord Jesus king then and that's
[1:03:39] going to be a day but it doesn't mean we
[1:03:40] have to be quiet until then
[1:03:42] I mean I haven't got so enthused I'd
[1:03:45] love to hear the stories of brother
[1:03:45] Brandon where he was getting so enthused
[1:03:47] he had to jump up and just run around a
[1:03:49] tree you know and I'm waiting for that
[1:03:52] day but I don't want it to be put on
[1:03:54] you know because you could just run
[1:03:56] around a tree and to be all you and then
[1:03:57] you can say I've ran around a tree no I
[1:03:59] want it to be something that
[1:04:01] foreign
[1:04:05] I just gotta go and then riding around
[1:04:08] and and I've had some of those times but
[1:04:10] I didn't have trees but but praise the
[1:04:12] Lord now those aren't I love those times
[1:04:16] I want those times but this is what
[1:04:19] this is a blooded
[1:04:20] Jesus Jesus
[1:04:23] it's his word that's what everything is
[1:04:26] dependent on then as long as everything
[1:04:28] that you're shouting about goes right
[1:04:30] back to this
[1:04:31] then praise the Lord I'll shout along
[1:04:33] with you
[1:04:35] amen now let's go to Luke chapter 24.
[1:04:39] isn't the word of Lord good I love his
[1:04:42] presence here oh it's good
[1:04:45] Luke chapter 24 we'll start with verse
[1:04:47] 36.
[1:04:48] now this is actually
[1:04:53] this actually took place
[1:04:55] before
[1:04:57] the Pentecost before the upper room so
[1:04:59] just long as you can read along and
[1:05:00] place this
[1:05:03] and as
[1:05:05] excuse me
[1:05:08] and as they just spake Jesus himself
[1:05:11] stood in the midst of them and said unto
[1:05:14] them peace be unto you and they were
[1:05:17] terrified and Afraid
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:22] and suppose that they had seen a spirit
[1:05:25] now
[1:05:26] let's put ourselves in their exact same
[1:05:28] their their flesh and blood just like we
[1:05:31] are
[1:05:32] and
[1:05:34] you know you're following Jesus
[1:05:36] yet when he appeared to them they were
[1:05:39] not expecting it that way
[1:05:42] so I always some people condemn them for
[1:05:45] for being scared he's like Noah I
[1:05:47] understand
[1:05:48] okay so let's keep reading and suppose
[1:05:51] that they had seen a spirit verse 38
[1:05:55] and he said
[1:05:56] get into that
[1:05:57] why are you troubled and why do your
[1:06:00] thoughts on why do thoughts arise in
[1:06:02] your hearts
[1:06:03] he's still reading
[1:06:06] amen it's not just some Spirit verse 30
[1:06:09] hands
[1:06:11] 39.
[1:06:14] behold my hands and my feet
[1:06:17] that
[1:06:19] handle me and see and he wants us to
[1:06:22] handle him prove me and see we when we
[1:06:25] handle the word we are handling Jesus
[1:06:28] himself
[1:06:29] and it's supposed to handle
[1:06:31] so make sure it lines up online not
[1:06:33] handle me check me out study to show
[1:06:37] yourself approved handle me amen Lord
[1:06:40] help us
[1:06:41] and handle me and see for a spirit hath
[1:06:45] not Flesh and Bones as easy I have and
[1:06:48] when verse 40 and when they had when he
[1:06:50] had thus spoken he showed them his hands
[1:06:52] and his feet verse 41 and while
[1:06:56] they yet believed
[1:06:59] not
[1:07:01] for Joy now that's a that's a weird
[1:07:03] statement right there
[1:07:05] it says they didn't believe
[1:07:08] but they were in
[1:07:10] Joy
[1:07:13] now we can do the exact same thing
[1:07:15] I'm Healed you could have joy that's
[1:07:18] when it's made real to you
[1:07:20] and which Spirit of the Lord can they
[1:07:22] fall
[1:07:23] into just in the
[1:07:25] unjust
[1:07:27] you can see the weeds and the wheat both
[1:07:29] jump up and rejoice
[1:07:31] but yet the weeds don't believe
[1:07:35] Lord help us that's why it says study to
[1:07:38] show you check your own self out every
[1:07:40] time I I check my own self out
[1:07:44] because I want to make sure I want to
[1:07:47] know that I know that I'm
[1:07:52] I'm
[1:07:54] just doing the things that you want to
[1:07:55] do and if I have because we get
[1:07:57] distracted life distracts us things
[1:08:00] happen but that's why this is so
[1:08:03] important
[1:08:05] church is so important Lord help us
[1:08:08] okay so they were shocked and while yet
[1:08:12] believe not for joy and wondered he said
[1:08:15] unto them
[1:08:16] have you any meat I can't imagine that's
[1:08:19] a do you have anything to eat
[1:08:22] and they were they were shocked and
[1:08:24] enjoying these and they probably looked
[1:08:25] around and well do we have any meat and
[1:08:28] it says and they gave him a piece of
[1:08:30] broiled fish and a honeycomb now
[1:08:34] I bet every eye was on him
[1:08:39] I mean because they handed I mean I bet
[1:08:41] their mouths were open
[1:08:44] handing them something
[1:08:45] and I mean because this had never
[1:08:48] happened
[1:08:49] four
[1:08:51] first time that walked right through and
[1:08:53] everybody being in there and then they
[1:08:58] before them so that took take a little
[1:09:01] bit of time you know you're eating
[1:09:03] everybody's looking at you don't you
[1:09:05] hate it when people are staring at you
[1:09:06] when you eat but that's what Jesus was
[1:09:09] letting them see him
[1:09:11] see
[1:09:12] my hands see my feet
[1:09:16] study me and he let him calm down out of
[1:09:19] their disbelief while he ate to tell him
[1:09:22] some truth
[1:09:25] I speak unto you well I was yet with you
[1:09:29] that all things must be fulfilled which
[1:09:31] were written in the law of Moses and the
[1:09:33] prophets and the Psalms concerning me
[1:09:36] he's like I I told you this would happen
[1:09:39] you didn't believe that your spirit your
[1:09:41] your healing was coming I told you you
[1:09:43] buy my stripes you're healed
[1:09:46] or whatever it is you're you're your
[1:09:49] sons and daughters are saved just just
[1:09:51] believe
[1:09:52] on them you know whatever promise it is
[1:09:55] I I told he's told us amen Lord help us
[1:09:59] now this is a tremendous one too verse
[1:10:02] 45 it says thanks Jesus to open it
[1:10:09] now
[1:10:14] this was before pep
[1:10:17] and yet their minds were open to
[1:10:20] understand what's what just was talking
[1:10:22] about
[1:10:24] so
[1:10:26] remember that scripture that talks about
[1:10:28] though I understand all Mysteries and
[1:10:30] have not love Christ's charity it
[1:10:34] profits me nothing
[1:10:36] now I can think
[1:10:39] see where this
[1:10:40] is a lot of danger for a message because
[1:10:43] we have so much knowledge given to us
[1:10:46] and as a kid group of man sorry as a as
[1:10:50] a child growing up in the message
[1:10:54] it was a i
[1:10:57] thought because I knew who brother
[1:10:59] random was I knew a lot of these
[1:11:01] Mysteries that I was okay
[1:11:04] that I was not okay
[1:11:06] says You must be born again you must
[1:11:10] know Jesus on a personal level
[1:11:15] and when I went away on College you know
[1:11:18] you get by yourself
[1:11:19] I think your true character comes up
[1:11:21] when you're by yourself
[1:11:23] what's inside of you
[1:11:25] I didn't like what I saw inside of me
[1:11:27] because nobody knew me at college so I
[1:11:30] could act any way I wanted to
[1:11:33] and I noticed that I didn't have an
[1:11:34] anchor I had head knowledge
[1:11:39] I could quote scriptures
[1:11:40] and somebody over there at college that
[1:11:42] was a denominational brother I could
[1:11:44] hang right with them talking about
[1:11:45] tremendous truths
[1:11:47] I mean we are so lucky
[1:11:49] we're we're we're where the Eagles are
[1:11:51] eating on the meat the things that the
[1:11:54] Lord let brother Braham showed us in
[1:11:55] this last I wouldn't want to live in any
[1:11:57] other age besides right now because all
[1:11:59] the open word that has has been given to
[1:12:02] us it's just been open from beginning to
[1:12:05] then all the Mysteries that we see
[1:12:07] amen but remember though you remember
[1:12:09] know all Mysteries so kids I implore you
[1:12:16] make sure you know Christ
[1:12:19] if you don't know Christ
[1:12:23] get to the altar while we're still here
[1:12:25] there is a reason why we are by the Lord
[1:12:28] has prolonged time
[1:12:30] not everyone is in yet
[1:12:33] he is waiting on somebody aren't you so
[1:12:36] glad that he's waiting on he's so
[1:12:38] long-suffering
[1:12:39] don't let us be the one that he's
[1:12:41] waiting on
[1:12:42] and just because we know you've got to
[1:12:45] have a personal experience I have
[1:12:47] drilled that into our kids because of my
[1:12:50] experience
[1:12:51] you have to
[1:12:53] personally
[1:12:55] I know Jesus
[1:12:57] yourself
[1:12:59] and and you
[1:13:01] you have to have that personal
[1:13:02] relationship with him
[1:13:04] and if you never have that time and
[1:13:07] study in prayer how do you get intimate
[1:13:10] with the Lord
[1:13:12] yeah
[1:13:15] congratulations knew his wife
[1:13:18] those words are actually the same
[1:13:22] and it's he had it
[1:13:24] an intimate relationship with his wife
[1:13:27] now don't you think that there is not a
[1:13:31] single person that God doesn't know he
[1:13:33] didn't even know you what's your name
[1:13:35] no he just didn't have his intimate
[1:13:39] relationship with you
[1:13:43] he he knows who you are but he's gotta
[1:13:46] he wants to know you and only you know
[1:13:49] somebody is to spend time with them
[1:13:51] Lord help us think about all the we're
[1:13:54] thinking about a microwave age
[1:13:56] and how we are so free to Worship the
[1:13:59] Lord in the United States
[1:14:01] but you get some people that they go in
[1:14:03] another country let's say China they got
[1:14:05] to sneak and hide
[1:14:07] yeah they they they they have to fight
[1:14:09] this
[1:14:10] spend time with the Lord to get together
[1:14:12] and yet
[1:14:14] we are so free and yet it's not as
[1:14:16] important to us
[1:14:18] oh Lord
[1:14:19] help us to get it back on that
[1:14:22] Lord time is at hand as the scripture
[1:14:25] says redeem the time
[1:14:27] the time that we're wasting redeem it
[1:14:29] back for the Lord that they might
[1:14:30] understand
[1:14:31] in the scriptures
[1:14:34] now verse 46.
[1:14:38] and he said unto them thus it is written
[1:14:40] and thus it behoove behoove Christ to
[1:14:43] suffer and to rise from the dead the
[1:14:44] third day
[1:14:45] and that repentance and remission of sin
[1:14:47] should be preached
[1:14:49] his name among all nations beginning at
[1:14:52] Jerusalem verse 48 and they are and ye
[1:14:55] are witnesses of these things and behold
[1:14:57] I send the promise of
[1:14:59] my
[1:15:00] father
[1:15:02] on you but Terry Yee in the city of
[1:15:06] Jerusalem until you be endured he
[1:15:07] understood the word the Lord has to give
[1:15:08] you an understanding
[1:15:10] you know Faith cometh by hearing
[1:15:13] and and how can you have faith in
[1:15:16] something unless you truly understand it
[1:15:18] like I can let's just use that scripture
[1:15:20] I've been quoting all this morning
[1:15:21] you're by my stripes you're healed
[1:15:24] I can have a physical understanding of
[1:15:26] that but until the Revelation comes I am
[1:15:31] healed
[1:15:33] then my faith gets raised to a different
[1:15:35] level
[1:15:36] and I have tremendous faith on that
[1:15:39] scripture
[1:15:40] so I hope you understand what I'm
[1:15:42] talking about that it takes Christ to
[1:15:44] open up our understanding and then you
[1:15:46] can have faith on what you what Christ
[1:15:48] has revealed to you and that's what they
[1:15:50] just did to all the disciples they just
[1:15:52] had their understanding open of what was
[1:15:55] supposed to happen to Jesus and they saw
[1:15:57] that and then their faith raised that is
[1:15:59] oh it did happen they did everything
[1:16:02] that they're supposed to do to him vote
[1:16:05] praise the Lord we're seeing it manifest
[1:16:07] in our day and we can say a lot of
[1:16:09] things about that then our day we're
[1:16:11] seeing the second coming we're seeing
[1:16:13] all these things lining up the doors are
[1:16:15] being closed prophecies are being
[1:16:16] fulfilled build Lord help us
[1:16:20] verse 50. and he and and he led them as
[1:16:23] far as Bethany and he lifted up his
[1:16:26] hands and blessed them and it came to
[1:16:28] pass why he blessed them he parted from
[1:16:31] them and carried and carried up into
[1:16:32] heaven amen and they worshiped him and
[1:16:36] returned to Jerusalem with great joy
[1:16:38] now verse 53 remember we were talking
[1:16:42] about they didn't just stay in the upper
[1:16:44] room listen what they did in verse 53
[1:16:46] and they were continually in
[1:16:49] what's up people
[1:16:53] see they stayed they did what Jesus said
[1:16:57] they went and stayed and it says and
[1:17:00] they were continually in the temple
[1:17:01] praising and blessing God
[1:17:06] um amen
[1:17:07] now that's the same thing that we do we
[1:17:10] can have church right here and I'm gonna
[1:17:12] call this a temple of God we've
[1:17:13] dedicated this building to Jesus amen
[1:17:16] and they're continued this is our place
[1:17:18] this is our this is our habit to go to
[1:17:19] this is where we want to go but after
[1:17:21] this we could go to the upper room
[1:17:24] some
[1:17:25] somebody's house to something not and if
[1:17:28] you're so enthused you don't want this
[1:17:29] ever to end so you go from this and you
[1:17:32] go to there you keep on talking about
[1:17:33] the Lord and they were so enjoy it says
[1:17:37] I mean can you imagine I bet their Joy
[1:17:39] never ended now where should we be
[1:17:42] oh we we shouldn't be in sadness and
[1:17:44] depression and and that's going rapid
[1:17:46] through the
[1:17:48] world
[1:17:50] I'm not saying if you're not Holy Ghost
[1:17:52] filled you can't get depressed when his
[1:17:53] wife died
[1:17:54] and yet he got so depressed that he
[1:17:56] tried to take his life
[1:17:59] Holy Ghost filled brother Brandon
[1:18:01] depression can come on any one of us
[1:18:04] don't think you're exempt and Satan will
[1:18:07] say well I have that depression so
[1:18:08] therefore I'm not the Lord's that's a
[1:18:10] lie of the devil fact is whenever he's
[1:18:13] talking he's lying
[1:18:15] he's lying because he's a Deceiver
[1:18:18] so don't let Satan ever take you down
[1:18:21] always go back to the word
[1:18:23] now Lord help us because it takes I keep
[1:18:27] it it takes Jesus to open our
[1:18:31] understanding that we are in our own way
[1:18:34] you know that's the remember the the
[1:18:36] greatest man over falls in the mind
[1:18:38] and it takes them to realize Versa hey
[1:18:41] you're thinking about that wrong you
[1:18:43] need to cast that out and think about it
[1:18:45] this way
[1:18:48] an atmosphere
[1:18:50] fear is created
[1:18:53] and the atmosphere is created
[1:18:55] and can you imagine the at but they had
[1:18:59] testimonies I bet they had somebody pray
[1:19:02] about the gifts for an action I bet all
[1:19:05] kinds of things were happening
[1:19:06] maybe not speaking in tongues because
[1:19:09] they went outside after the Holy Ghost
[1:19:10] fell on them tongues but I'm
[1:19:12] just saying I bet they were like you
[1:19:13] remember when Jesus did that and that
[1:19:15] scripture was fulfilled here the
[1:19:17] testimonies that was going on in the
[1:19:18] atmosphere that was created and
[1:19:21] in that building
[1:19:23] they had high expectation
[1:19:27] now do you think they were just playing
[1:19:29] games
[1:19:31] talking about the weather
[1:19:33] they went there with high expectations
[1:19:36] now if we did the exact same thing
[1:19:41] what an atmosphere
[1:19:44] to Hayek anything can happen
[1:19:46] Anything Could Happen
[1:19:48] and it says we're two or three are
[1:19:50] gathered
[1:19:51] Jesus is there
[1:19:53] we got more than two or three and we're
[1:19:55] gathered in his name we're talking about
[1:19:57] him we're singing songs to him amen so
[1:20:00] what's that mean he's here
[1:20:02] he's we named me not me and I believe
[1:20:04] see him with our eyes but he's
[1:20:08] here and and it's not all about can you
[1:20:11] can you uh feel it it's more about do
[1:20:14] you believe it now I love to feel him I
[1:20:18] love to feel the anointing and I can
[1:20:19] feel the anointing but even if I didn't
[1:20:22] feel the anointing he honors his word
[1:20:24] and it's and it's him that's here oh
[1:20:27] it's a great thing that's why we come to
[1:20:31] be pleasing and worshiping the king
[1:20:33] amen and they continued verse and this
[1:20:35] is in Acts chapter 1 verse 14.
[1:20:38] and the these all continued in one
[1:20:40] Accord in prayer and supplication
[1:20:43] with the women and I love how this
[1:20:45] scripture calls out and says and Mary
[1:20:48] the mother of Jesus and his brother and
[1:20:50] he calls out hey Mary has to go through
[1:20:53] this if Mary has to go so do you she
[1:20:56] wasn't something special that's it now
[1:20:58] she was but it was so the crisis being
[1:21:01] formed in each one of us also but the
[1:21:04] actual Christ was formed in her amen but
[1:21:06] and then you get a Catholic churches
[1:21:08] that does worship Mary and he's like no
[1:21:12] no no she had to be go to the exact same
[1:21:14] thing that we had to go through and it
[1:21:16] says verse 15 and in those days Peter
[1:21:18] stood up in the midst of the disciples
[1:21:19] and said the number of the names were
[1:21:21] about 120 there's like 100
[1:21:24] 20 of them up there so let's go to Acts
[1:21:27] chapter 2.
[1:21:29] and let's go to verse one
[1:21:31] this is what happens when we wait on the
[1:21:34] Lord
[1:21:37] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:21:40] become
[1:21:42] they were all in one Accord in one place
[1:21:44] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:21:46] Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind I just
[1:21:49] brother Branham heard that many times
[1:21:53] oh my we may not hear it but I still
[1:21:56] think he's here
[1:21:57] but to hear it would be awesome wouldn't
[1:21:59] it
[1:22:00] Amen to see some of the things would be
[1:22:02] great I've never spoken in tongues but
[1:22:04] to speak in tongues I think would be
[1:22:06] great amen I've never so doesn't mean
[1:22:08] I'm not saved because I didn't speak in
[1:22:10] tongues or if you've never preached the
[1:22:12] gospel if you've never sung a special no
[1:22:14] just be about what the Lord has you
[1:22:16] placed and then don't try to be
[1:22:19] something you're not and if it's your
[1:22:21] place the Lord will make a way for you
[1:22:23] you don't have to beg plead or beg or or
[1:22:26] politic to get your way into that place
[1:22:28] because then it's you put yourself in
[1:22:30] there and it may not be Lord but if you
[1:22:32] don't have to do anything and the Lord
[1:22:34] places you there
[1:22:35] the neck should give you confidence this
[1:22:38] is my place amen Lord help us and the
[1:22:41] sound of a rushing
[1:22:43] Mighty Wind and it filled the house
[1:22:45] where they were sitting and there
[1:22:47] appeared unto them cloves of tongues of
[1:22:49] like as fire and it sat upon each of
[1:22:52] them and they were all filled with the
[1:22:54] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:22:56] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:22:58] utterance now we talked about this but I
[1:23:01] want to read this book from Brother
[1:23:02] brand believe us without this it says
[1:23:03] and let me tell you something right now
[1:23:05] Virgin Mary in them was right among them
[1:23:08] that's right and if God wouldn't respect
[1:23:10] the holy Virgin Mary to get to heaven
[1:23:12] any any other way besides receiving the
[1:23:15] Holy Ghost women what about you now
[1:23:17] remember we are the bride of Christ so
[1:23:19] men and women amen that's right
[1:23:22] you have to pay the same price get
[1:23:25] the same experience experience and have
[1:23:28] the same thing that they had back there
[1:23:30] at the beginning doesn't matter if
[1:23:32] you're part of the message church we
[1:23:34] still have to get the exact same
[1:23:36] experience as they got back then
[1:23:39] Lord help us
[1:23:41] now
[1:23:42] this is from the fourth seal
[1:23:45] I love
[1:23:46] how brother Brian dramatizes a lot of
[1:23:48] things
[1:23:49] he puts it in words that we can
[1:23:51] understand in our own language that I
[1:23:53] just love it okay we'll read it the
[1:23:55] fourth seal it says and they went up to
[1:23:56] the upper room
[1:23:57] and maybe one said well I believe we
[1:24:01] waited long enough let's just accept it
[1:24:03] by faith
[1:24:05] now he said brother man says that's a
[1:24:08] good Baptist Doctrine
[1:24:10] but it didn't work with them brothers
[1:24:12] and so first thing you know it had to
[1:24:14] become a reality
[1:24:17] so let me pause there
[1:24:19] because that is a powerful statement
[1:24:22] that when you're praying
[1:24:24] let's just accept it by faith
[1:24:27] and move on
[1:24:29] didn't wait
[1:24:32] long and
[1:24:33] enough
[1:24:35] that how many times have I done that
[1:24:38] I have done that
[1:24:40] so when the lord gave me this it changed
[1:24:43] my attitude about praying
[1:24:45] now remember he said
[1:24:47] Terry stay in Jerusalem he's at the
[1:24:49] altar
[1:24:51] but you had better be at the altar of
[1:24:53] your heart
[1:24:54] and just because we pray for something
[1:24:56] your cause of the prayer and you have to
[1:24:59] go to work
[1:25:00] you can continue to pray for that
[1:25:03] for days weeks on pray until something
[1:25:08] happens
[1:25:10] because yes by faith we have to claim it
[1:25:14] but you also know when something takes
[1:25:16] place
[1:25:18] when that faith that cometh
[1:25:20] amen so let's keep on reading that was
[1:25:22] good Baptist Doctrine but it didn't work
[1:25:24] for them brothers
[1:25:25] so then the first thing you know it had
[1:25:27] to become a reality and they waited on
[1:25:30] their Ministry for the word to be
[1:25:31] Vindicated and when you come to seek the
[1:25:34] Holy Ghost you do the same
[1:25:36] yes you can accept it by faith you have
[1:25:40] to accept it by faith that's exactly
[1:25:42] right and you accept the Holy Spirit by
[1:25:45] faith but then you let the Holy Spirit
[1:25:47] come and give the circumcision as a
[1:25:50] witness that he has accepted your faith
[1:25:53] see amen
[1:25:56] and he goes and puts it in scripture you
[1:25:58] see brother Brandon believe God
[1:26:01] Abraham sorry he said Abraham believed
[1:26:04] God and it was imputed unto him for
[1:26:06] righteousness
[1:26:07] but God gave him the sign of
[1:26:09] circumcision as a confirmation that he
[1:26:12] had accepted his faith
[1:26:16] wait and
[1:26:18] until God accepts your faith you don't
[1:26:21] think we're going to be tested and tried
[1:26:23] I'm gonna go right back to Abraham
[1:26:24] remember he went up to sacrifice Isaac
[1:26:26] you know his faith was tested right to
[1:26:30] the point where he was going to replunge
[1:26:32] the knife
[1:26:33] and then he said hold don't you think
[1:26:35] your faith is going to be tested if
[1:26:37] Abraham's all these examples I mean
[1:26:39] think about all these things that David
[1:26:40] you're going to be king
[1:26:41] but yet I'm going to test you to see if
[1:26:43] you still believe you're going to be
[1:26:44] king and I'm going to have some
[1:26:46] I'll chase you out in order to try to
[1:26:47] kill you
[1:26:48] you know don't you think Satan's gonna
[1:26:51] do the same thing let's try to kill us
[1:26:53] and yet Lord I know that you've got my
[1:26:55] way
[1:26:56] yeah I know that your your path is
[1:26:58] correct no matter you tried
[1:27:00] almost to the breaking point but praise
[1:27:03] the Lord he won't put on more than you
[1:27:04] can bear praise the Lord now that's a
[1:27:06] promise that I
[1:27:08] thrust on Lord I don't know why I'm
[1:27:10] going through this
[1:27:11] but I know that no matter what there is
[1:27:15] a way out
[1:27:16] you can have the biggest storm in your
[1:27:19] life
[1:27:20] and yet inside
[1:27:21] be at peace
[1:27:23] because that's the that's the harbor of
[1:27:27] Faith that's that that's it
[1:27:29] you know that the eye of the storm it's
[1:27:31] all peace storm all around
[1:27:34] Lord help us
[1:27:36] it says uh but God gave him the sign of
[1:27:40] circumcision as a confirmation
[1:27:42] nation that he had accepted his faith
[1:27:44] just so you know this is a 1963 the
[1:27:46] fourth seal Okay so
[1:27:49] so the the
[1:27:52] until we were changed until something
[1:27:56] actually happened I don't care what
[1:27:58] format comes in and I believe that
[1:28:01] speaking in tongues all of those things
[1:28:02] are right but just that in itself won't
[1:28:05] work and you know it won't work so it
[1:28:07] doesn't work now I'm going to skip down
[1:28:09] just a little bit it says but when he
[1:28:12] the person The Immortal Spirit of Christ
[1:28:14] becomes your personal Savior and changes
[1:28:17] you and throws your views straight into
[1:28:20] Calvary in his word something has
[1:28:22] happened yes sir something has happened
[1:28:25] no one will have to tell you about it
[1:28:27] you'll know when it happens oh my
[1:28:30] amen praise the Lord now we're almost
[1:28:33] done
[1:28:34] but isn't this been good so I'm going to
[1:28:36] read two more scriptures
[1:28:38] so let's turn there let's go First
[1:28:40] Corinthians chapter 16. First
[1:28:42] Corinthians chapter 16.
[1:28:45] we'll read verse 7 and 8.
[1:28:54] for I will not see you now by the way
[1:28:58] but I trust to tarry a while with you if
[1:29:01] the Lord permit verse 8. but I will tear
[1:29:04] you at Ephesus
[1:29:06] until Pentecost
[1:29:08] now we are supposed to do the same with
[1:29:11] each one
[1:29:13] they that wait upon the Lord somebody
[1:29:15] comes to the altar tarry within until
[1:29:18] Pentecost tarry with them until
[1:29:21] something happens
[1:29:22] we're supposed to tarry with our
[1:29:24] brothers and sisters especially when
[1:29:26] they're seeking something wait with them
[1:29:28] it it's it gives you
[1:29:31] new Comfort I remember every time I go
[1:29:33] to the Altar and some brother lays their
[1:29:36] hand on he gives me Comfort
[1:29:38] that they're they're they're praying
[1:29:40] with me they're they got my back they
[1:29:43] got now a lot of times the Lord will
[1:29:45] bring somebody to your mind
[1:29:48] that they live in a completely different
[1:29:49] state
[1:29:51] or whatever and you pray for them and
[1:29:54] that person has no idea that you prayed
[1:29:57] for them have you ever heard that song
[1:29:58] Somebody
[1:30:00] prayed for me
[1:30:03] they had me on their mind
[1:30:08] they sacrificed their time they fell
[1:30:11] down on their knees and prayed
[1:30:13] before for me
[1:30:15] oh my
[1:30:17] they had no doubt to bring me out but he
[1:30:21] could change my life and set me free and
[1:30:24] I love this oh I'm so glad that someone
[1:30:28] prayed for me
[1:30:30] and they don't even need to know it
[1:30:32] but if you have a gift of Prayer pray
[1:30:35] for that person pray for them the last
[1:30:38] scripture Galatians chapter 4 19.
[1:30:43] ah
[1:30:46] foreign
[1:30:49] birth again until
[1:30:53] Christ be formed in you
[1:30:56] so it's a travail in birth it's a battle
[1:31:00] it's there's pain there's burp pains
[1:31:03] but he says I travail in birth with you
[1:31:06] again until Christ be formed in you
[1:31:10] and we're supposed to do that with each
[1:31:12] one
[1:31:13] and and you may not see it happen right
[1:31:17] away I don't know if you I love songs
[1:31:18] they speak to your heart and even when
[1:31:21] you don't see him he's working
[1:31:23] amen that that is a great song Because
[1:31:25] when you pray for something and you have
[1:31:28] faith
[1:31:29] there's a miracle in the making
[1:31:31] it I have faith that it's coming
[1:31:34] you may not see it
[1:31:37] but it's on its way
[1:31:40] think about with Daniel
[1:31:42] he had Faith he prayed and yet it took
[1:31:44] 21 days now that was a spiritual battle
[1:31:47] that literally took place and it's in
[1:31:50] the scripture for us to know there's a
[1:31:52] battle going on that we can't see
[1:31:55] and he was trying to get an answer
[1:31:58] to Daniel
[1:32:00] and this is and it
[1:32:02] and it didn't happen
[1:32:05] even though the answer was on his way
[1:32:08] he kept on praying didn't doubt
[1:32:12] that the answer was on his way and the
[1:32:15] faith worked through and the lord gave
[1:32:17] him his answer now same thing with
[1:32:19] cancer
[1:32:20] or with anything else
[1:32:22] once you speak the name of Jesus over
[1:32:26] that
[1:32:27] demons have to flee
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:30] don't let your faith waver
[1:32:34] and praying for that lost loved one and
[1:32:36] you see him go deeper into the world
[1:32:38] don't let your faith
[1:32:45] your faith is yours
[1:32:48] it says above
[1:32:49] above all
[1:32:51] take the shield of Faith your biggest
[1:32:54] weapon
[1:32:56] hey man I just had a sermon the other
[1:32:58] day and I had my son Micah he had a
[1:33:00] shield that was the size of himself you
[1:33:02] know you could pretty much hide behind
[1:33:03] it and I gave my other son a paper plate
[1:33:06] and I said which Faith do you want
[1:33:08] I want to hide completely behind it
[1:33:12] I don't want anything to happen
[1:33:14] nothing can get through now the Armory
[1:33:17] of God is for you you're choosing your
[1:33:20] take you can choose to pay per plate or
[1:33:22] you can choose the great big thing how
[1:33:24] much Faith do you you have
[1:33:28] and if you don't have faith Lord I
[1:33:31] believe but help thou my unbelief that's
[1:33:34] the first thing that something hits
[1:33:39] that's that
[1:33:41] that's the you know the fiery darts of
[1:33:42] the devil are quenched
[1:33:44] and once they get there you can break
[1:33:46] them
[1:33:47] Lord help us to put on that armor until
[1:33:50] you go to battle
[1:33:51] don't let me imagine a kid that's uh not
[1:33:54] fully trained with a sword trying to go
[1:33:56] fight with a sword no no no no no wait
[1:33:59] until
[1:34:00] wait until once you get endured with
[1:34:03] power on high now even the disciples
[1:34:05] they were scared to death hiding in that
[1:34:07] Upper Room
[1:34:09] but as soon as the Holy Ghost came man
[1:34:11] their their doubts and fears just went
[1:34:13] away and they're you know Faith muscle
[1:34:15] pooped up and out in the streets they
[1:34:17] went and they're like listen to this
[1:34:21] that both LED Lord and Jesus that you
[1:34:23] crucified he is our savior
[1:34:26] and before then they were like whoa I'm
[1:34:29] scared but all we have to have is faith
[1:34:32] but to be sent of the whole
[1:34:34] Holy Ghost
[1:34:37] because we can hurt somebody you know
[1:34:39] let her kill us
[1:34:40] but the spirit brings lives so you can
[1:34:43] kill somebody with the word if you're
[1:34:45] not using it race
[1:34:48] it's by Grace we are saved you know
[1:34:50] through faith aren't you so glad for
[1:34:53] Grace but the thing it is is once you
[1:34:55] get Christ on the inside
[1:34:57] it's written on your heart and that law
[1:35:00] will just come out you don't have to
[1:35:01] tell somebody how to dress how to live
[1:35:04] their life you get them to Christ and
[1:35:07] you get hands off
[1:35:09] because now it's up to Christ to dress
[1:35:11] them nobody else
[1:35:14] well I think you should do that I don't
[1:35:16] care what you think I want to walk what
[1:35:18] God wants of me
[1:35:22] but something
[1:35:25] push my convictions on you no
[1:35:28] I'm not
[1:35:30] I'm just gonna Lord will be whispered
[1:35:33] and pointing to other people
[1:35:35] what look what they're doing pray for
[1:35:37] them
[1:35:38] amen and if they're in the wrong Lord
[1:35:41] will lead them to the right all we got
[1:35:43] to do is love them and bring them in you
[1:35:46] can you can there's a saying that you
[1:35:48] can't you can lead a horse to water
[1:35:52] but you can't make him drink can you
[1:35:54] imagine me trying to get a big old
[1:35:55] strong horse hanging on him get him down
[1:35:58] in there and when I finally get him down
[1:35:59] in there I'll go too far and I'll drown
[1:36:01] him
[1:36:02] you know because I don't I don't know
[1:36:03] what I'm doing I can't
[1:36:05] control it same thing with us
[1:36:08] you force them into it because it was

[1:40:33] [Music]
[1:40:35] three Hebrew children they waited
[1:40:38] you know I believe that's one of our

[1:41:16] the Lord asked us to do it as often as
[1:41:18] we meet and so forth and we like to try
[1:41:20] to do it once a month Amen to remember
[1:41:23] what Jesus Christ did because we know
[1:41:25] that him paying the price everything
[1:41:27] hinged
[1:41:28] on him giving his life
[1:41:31] amen suffering dying
[1:41:34] and then rising in the third day amen
[1:41:37] and so we just want to remember what
[1:41:40] Christ did for us Amen in First
[1:41:42] Corinthians
[1:41:43] 11.
[1:41:46] First Corinthians 11.
[1:41:50] and we'll begin with verse 23. all says
[1:41:54] that this way he says for I have
[1:41:55] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:41:57] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:41:59] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:42:01] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:42:03] he break it and said take eat this is my
[1:42:06] body which is broken for you this too in
[1:42:09] remembrance of me
[1:42:12] after the same manner also he took the
[1:42:14] cup
[1:42:16] and when he adds up saying this cup is
[1:42:18] the New Testament in my blood
[1:42:20] as often as ye drink it in remembrance
[1:42:23] of me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:42:26] and drink of this cup you do show the
[1:42:27] Lord's death till he come wherefore
[1:42:30] whosoever shall eat of this bread and
[1:42:32] drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily
[1:42:33] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:42:36] the Lord and but let the man examine
[1:42:37] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[1:42:40] and drink of that cup for he that eateth
[1:42:42] and drinketh unworthily eat it and drink
[1:42:45] a damnation to himself not Discerning
[1:42:47] the Lord's body and for this cause many
[1:42:49] are weak and sickly among you and many
[1:42:52] sleep for we would judge ourselves we
[1:42:54] should not be judged but when we are
[1:42:56] judged we are chasing of the Lord that
[1:42:58] we should not be condemned with the
[1:42:59] world wait for my brethren when you come
[1:43:03] put together to eat Terry one for
[1:43:05] another If any man hunger let him eat at
[1:43:07] home
[1:43:08] that ye come not together unto
[1:43:10] condemnation and the rest will I said in
[1:43:12] order
[1:43:13] when I come let's bow our heads up we
[1:43:15] have a moment of silence today
[1:43:17] that you can take a moment to examine
[1:43:20] yourself to see whether you're worthy or
[1:43:22] not for you to judge yourself and if
[1:43:24] you've done any wrong and make your
[1:43:25] confessions to the Lord so that when you
[1:43:28] come to eat of the bread and drink of
[1:43:30] the wine so you don't drink condemnation
[1:43:32] amen and so let's have a moment of
[1:43:35] silence
[1:43:50] and Heavenly Father we just ask God that
[1:43:52] you would wash any sins away that's in
[1:43:54] any of our Lives father
[1:43:56] even thinks perhaps that we don't know
[1:43:58] about Lord but we ask God that we come
[1:44:00] holy and pure before you Lord Jesus
[1:44:02] father that we would be worthy of taking
[1:44:04] and remembering this as you have given
[1:44:06] us orders Lord
[1:44:07] bless each one that partakes in Jesus
[1:44:10] name amen all those who want to take a
[1:44:12] partake of the communion come over on

[1:52:33] if you will
[1:52:34] just turn to Saint John 13.
[1:52:40] now before the Feast of the Passover
[1:52:42] when Jesus knew that his hour was come
[1:52:44] that he should depart out of this world
[1:52:45] unto the father
[1:52:47] having loved his own which were in the
[1:52:49] world he loved them
[1:52:51] and to the end can I just stop for a
[1:52:53] second
[1:52:54] here he talks about
[1:52:56] departing isn't that right
[1:52:59] unto the father having loved his own
[1:53:01] which were in the world
[1:53:03] we're looking for him to come back again
[1:53:05] amen
[1:53:06] and to receive us to himself the ones
[1:53:09] that he loves amen we're at that point
[1:53:12] now amen and supper being ended the
[1:53:15] devil having now put into the heart of
[1:53:16] Judas iscari at Simon's son to betray
[1:53:19] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:53:21] given all things into his hands that he
