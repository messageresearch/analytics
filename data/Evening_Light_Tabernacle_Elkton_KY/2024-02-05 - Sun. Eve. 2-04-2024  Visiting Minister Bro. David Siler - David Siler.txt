master [Music] I said he knows your voice let your hands it's time to Rejoice child your cry has AOK Master how do you believe that God orchestrates things even when it comes to the s of songs well the Lord laid this message on my heart earlier in the week to speak to you today and I want to speak on that song we just sang tonight Matthew Chapter 14 verse 22 I believe our God is so mindful of us Matthew 14:22 me and your song leader didn't get together to make sure that happened but I believe we serve the same God don't you Matthew 14:22 I just love when the Lord puts things together and validates what he's placed on your heart whenever he had started the service with that song the Master of the wind I thought how perfect they singing that song tonight and then whenever he gets ready to call me out he could not said a better tongue Matthew 14:22 straightway Jesus strangest disciples to get into a ship and to go before him to the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain part to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went into to them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it's a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight way Jesus spake un them saying hallelujah be a good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said said not 75 scriptures not 150 quotes one word and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship look at your Bible when he come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go meet Jesus amen let's buy our hearts tonight ask the Lord to come and help us now Heavenly Father we just believe tonight Lord that you have orchestrated this moment and this time and Lord Lord I just pray Lord for the things that we have upon our heart tonight that you would just help me Lord that I can yield to your presence that you could just come speak these things to us Lord we believe that you are so mindful of our needs and Lord we thank you that you're so faithful Lord to everything in our lives Lord whatever need we would have whatever would come up you're so faithful to provide and tonight Lord for the preaching of the word may you come once again as we pull our chairs your table Lord we come we're hungry tonight we desire something from your presence something from your word may we be edified Lord by our high have your way in this place and we'll give you the Praise In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ and everybody said amen God bless you tonight you can be seated praise the lord well that's certainly wonderful to um see the way this has come together now it makes me a lot less nervous knowing that the Lord's truly behind this I'm going to speak to you tonight on something really strange something really odd and I want to take this tonight to kind of um give us some direction for a while I believe that the L Lord is directing us to as his children we know that we're living in a time period today when our faith is going to be tested more than it's ever been tested before and we know I belief what we stand upon what we believe the principles of what we believe it's going to have all kinds of opposition that's going to come against it and we know that Satan has sent every demon out of hell to come against the bride in this last day he has sent every disease at his disposal every weapon that he has he has sent everything that he has to try to upset the plan of God for this day and he's actually not just coming against the world though we know that they are affected by this too but he's affecting you and I as the children of God and we see that we see termoil everywhere we look we see turmoil in the world we see Church turmoil trouble stress sickness problems everywhere we look and that's why I'd like to speak on this subject tonight to kind of help your faith just for a few minutes but I want to make a statement No don't throw me out till we get done tonight but I want to make this statement to you and it's want to be real strange but I would personally like to have the ability to walk on water I know oh Lord what kind of a nut we got preaching tonight I would love to have the ability to be able to walk on water now you might think that that's crazy why in the world would any man want to possess the ability to be able to walk on water but understand and I'm not talking about a river I'm not talking about a lake I'm not talking about a pond I'm talking about life in many different places the prophet tells us that life is like a sea and brother Rim said a sea is always unstable that it always has the ability to be connected to the weather that no matter however much the wind would blow that the sea becomes unstable whenever the wind blows and we know that the prophet tells us that not only is the see unstable but life itself it is unstable it's uncertain it's always moving it's always being tsed about it's always being tossed to and fro and brother said that life is like the storms that comes upon a sea and he said when the wind whips upon that sea and as it comes across the top of that water it changes the condition of the water and it causes the sea to become unstable and we know that's a type of the age that we're living in that this is an age AG of uncertainty as a matter of fact whenever David described it in the Book of Psalms chapter 27 that David said that we are living in a time of trouble brother and sister how true is that today that there has never been trouble like there is today and I want to say this tonight that we cannot expect for the Seas to remain calm we can't expect for the waters to remain calm you cannot expect the days of calm Waters is over the days of the Seas being leveled out those days is done as a matter of fact it's going to get worse and worse and worse as more as the signs of the end time begins to unfold and the governments are contrary one to another people are contrary one to another the waters are going to continue to get worse and more rough and more rough more tumultous than what they ever have been and people themselves the prophet tells us towards the end are going to go completely in Saye all I can say is we have a right when you don't know what you are you don't know what a man is you don't know what a woman is I can honestly say that tells me we have lost our minds we have went completely insane when people today and because of the uncertainty amongst the people what's it do it puts pressure on our homes pressure on our minds pressure on our jobs and the thing of it is it's because the world has went in to this chaotic condition to where the waters are so rough that no nobody knows where to turn psychiatrist are trying to find psychiatrist and the doctors don't have the answer and they tell us that they don't have the answer and certainly our governments don't have the answer the pope don't have the answer the doctors of divinity theologians they don't understand it because there's trouble everywhere we look trouble in our nation troubles everywhere that we look at that's the reason why tonight I tell you I want the ability to be able to walk on the water I want to the ability to be able to walk over it I don't want to be like the rest of the world that s sinks in Despair and the depravity of the world but I want to have the ability to be able to walk over trouble to walk over stress to walk over sicknesses to walk over diseases if I can't stop the waves from coming and I can't stop the waters becoming tumult us and we can't stop the storms coming up I want to have the ability to walk on what other people sink in now I'm not going to ask God and you and I realize we cannot ask God God calling the waters for [Music] us Lord give us a little bit more time and Lord give the waters a little bit of a break and let it calm down a little bit listen friends why in the world do we need the waters to stop when we got a God that has the ability to give you that strength to walk upon the waters I don't want to be tossed around like the rest of the world I don't want to be tossed around and have so much uncertainty de mind I want to walk on the water I want to walk on it why sink to the bottom when you got the power to be able to walk on the water when you serve a god that is a creator of the water and a creator of the heavens and he's a creator of the earth why seek when your God has given you the authority like Peter that you can walk on the water why put up with when you can walk over it and that's our setting tonight our scene opens up upon the Sea of gilee and it's a tremendous time now because remember the prophet tells us whenever the disciples is going to cross this water as our brother just sang and he tells us that as the boat comes upon the Water he said notice that Jesus is sending them to the other side so see but I want to remind you we didn't go on our own we didn't start this walk on Upon Our Own but it is the Lord that is commissioned us and has commed commissioned us to cross the sea [Music] so if he's told me to go the way through and here the disciples are in this boat they've been here all night now think about this it is the darkest time of the night it is the fourth watch Being divided into the watches it is the fourth watch of theight so they're Tire they're wore out I'm preaching to you right now you get tired you get weary in the fourth watch in the darkest age in the darkest hour when it looks like there ain't nobody going to be able to make it in the Fourth Watch of the night it is the darkest time and the darkest hour and here comes the storm against God's people now let me say this this storm ain't just against anybody but the biggest part of this storm is trying to upset the elect that is in this boat trying to cross the waters the ones that Jesus loves the one that Jesus cares of about and here is Satan coming against his elect here he is coming against his Chosen and now God now remember the prophet tells us that Jesus was not out on the water but he had climbed up to the highest hill and he said he'd been watching that boat out of upon that sea let me just tell you you may not see him nowhere around you you may not feel him nowhere around you but the prophet said his eye is always on you and he's always watching he's always looking he's always mindful of it Here Comes This Storm this storm is not Jesus testing them this storm is not Jesus trying them to see where their faith is at he's not trying to see how much Faith they got but the prophet tells us in the message of perfect Faith where the Storm come from he said this storm come up because of the devil and he said here is Satan trying to take advantage of these disciples because he sees them in the Ship Without Jesus so he was waiting for the moment he was looking for the time that Jesus ain't in the boat and now he sees him on the sea and they're all by their C there is no Jesus that's going to put his foot on the bow of the boat he's not in the ship and Satan but tells us that Satan is sending this storm and he said here is what Satan's doing he's got a demon on every way he said he's got a demon of Doubt on every wave and he said this next wave I'm going to take him out this next wave is going to sink the ship and Jesus is watching over all of it so they're crossing the sea the waters are so choppy the waters are so rough and the prophet tells us they got scared now you realize we look at that and we think why would they be scared did they not see the Miracles did they not see the signs did they not see the Wonder they've seen blinded eyes come open they've seen the lame walk they've seen all of this but notice when whenever Jesus ain't nowhere near and they can't see him with the natural eye notice now they're going to have to walk by a faith that they've never had to possess before they've never had to walk like this they've never had to go like this and Satan knows that Jesus ain't there and fear grips them when we can't look down at them fear's done us the same way and the prophet tells us that fear paralyzes faith that faith and fear cannot be in the same place at the same time you either got fa or you got fear and let me tell you that's the same thing that comes to us first bad report from the doctor we get scared first sign the flu we get scared first sign of Co first sign of a c first sign of a knows what happens we get scared and brother said these demons was watching these disciples on every wave they would come up thinking it could any moment at any time they can be going and Satan let me say this Satan is saying the same thing tonight as what he said against them he's trying to let you know you won't make it through this age all it takes is one more way one more trouble one more doctor visit one more bad MRI one more bad CT scan that's all you're going to be able to take but let me say this Jesus Is Watching Over Us I said Jesus is watching us there has never been a time but the the threat of the kingdom of hell was going to come that Jesus didn't divert that threat and settle it for his disciples you who believe the word for this day is who hell's going to be against you that stands for truth Satan hates you he hates you so bad listen he ain't out here trying to get denomination he's already got him he's not trying to get out here and getting the people in the pups he's already he wants those that says they're Believers he wants those that says I believe the word those that are Christ followers that that's who he want he wants young people that claims that they're children of God he wants moms and dads that has a principle and stands on the principles of the word that's who he wants you know why you're a threat to the kingdom of hell so what's he caus waves of sicknesses come by storms of discouragement come by he causes doubts he causes troubles I'm preaching to you you know why he wants to make us fear he knows if he can get these disciples and if he can get Christ disciples if he can get us to fear and shake them up enough and steer them up in that boat enough he knows he'll eventually sink the boat even Satan knows that faith cannot stand in the atmosphere of fear he knows faith cannot reside at the same time so what's he do he gets them looking at the waves he gets them looking at how much water's coming in the boat he gets him looking at broken ores are you hearing me he gets us looking at everything that goes wrong he gets us looking at the news you might not even worri about the news like the prophet said it's going to be the it's going to be the same thing but a different person that ain't changing it's the same thing but different people is that right there no sense to look at it's going to be the same thing over and over and over again and what Satan is doing is he wants to bring obstacles and he wants to bring confusion bring doubt bring fear into our minds to try to limit our faith from being able to move if he can bring me to a place where he paralyzes me and I'm get in that weak moment he's looking for that vul moment that weak moment when you're down when you're discouraged when you're depressed and he'll use everything that's around you he'll use all kinds of sicknesses that are around to try to make you doubt your Fai he'll put a demon on every wave he'll do everything he can to sink your boat now what does Satan Tak as he sees this advantage here is the disciples and no doubt you know these men is not just men that doesn't know anything about the water they've been raised on the sea they know what this they know what the Sea of galile is like they know how storms can come up but this ain't a normal this ain't a normal storm I'm gonna tell you one more time this ain't a normal storm this is a fourth watch storm and Why Oh Glory and why they are in Despair and it looks like there's no way they're going to make it and Satan's done everything he can to sink that boat but what Satan didn't know is Jesus was coming Hallelujah I said Jesus was coming and when Jesus came off the mountain amen and he come down on the sea and he come down on the waters and he come down in your life he came walking on top of the W waves he came walking over every redeeming he come walking over all the trouble he come walking right down where they was at let me tell you that's the same thing that God did for you he come walking over your trouble he come walking in your sin and iniquity maybe you was in a drug house he came walking to where you was at he walked right down into that Ballroom he walked right down in your depravity you know how he knew where to get you he'd been watching you he'd been watching you he knew right where you was at he knew the trouble that you was in he was mindful of everything that you was going through and that's my message you can either sit in the boat or you can walk on the water you hear that you can either let me tell you you can either just sit around this thing and let it be scriptures quotes good feelings good church good sermons pretty ideal socialized religion or you can be somebody that steps out of the boat you can be one of those Believers and when it comes time to believe you're going to that's what believers do they believe I can't think of nothing better brother Tom I can't think of nothing better tonight than a whole church walking on water amen I say we need to look up say Lord if that be you be me to come to thee upon the [Applause] Water can you imagine young people walk Walking on water preachers walking on water deacons walking on water trust it everybody Walking On Water Peter looks up and they see something coming on the water and fear struck them but Peter Allelujah Peter looks beyond waves Glory he looks beyond trouble and he says Lord if that that be you do you know why Peter says this because he knows it's no longer safe in the boat are you hear me I'm telling you listen it's no longer safe in this boat no more Lord if that be you didn't me to come walk on up friend there's only one way to do that there's only one day you've got to call out yourself it must be an individual Revelation in every heart that when you see the word for yourself that you say Lord if that be you and you read your Bible Lord if that be you whenever you get down lord if that be you when you push play Lord if that be you Lord B me I don't want to just hear I want to be an actor of the word I don't want to just talk about it I don't want it to be TBL talk I want to become the very embodiment of what it says that be you bid me as an individual to come walking on the water you know what Jesus said think about this Jesus uses one word I like that he uses one word come he don't he don't say and Moses said and Jeremiah said and Nehemiah said and Ezekiel said and Isaiah said one word one word think about one word you think what you need for the word to be put into action all we need is one word but that word is not just any word that word may be spoken by one syllable but let me tell you it may be spoken that way but when it's received it goes past the fifth all my it gets way down inside of the heart it goes way down inside the soul of a man and something about that word begins to steer on the Inside Man and it does something to the inside of a man hey man it's more than just hearing the word but there's an action from the inside Lord if that be you bid me to come and walk on the water so we must have a part in this bid me what are you hearing can I ask you that what do you need to hear tonight what do you need to hear is it a good sermon we've heard a lot of good sermons what do you need to hear what do you in your personal walk with God I'm not talking about me don't think about me I'm talking about what are you needing to hear to build your play your life into a place and a sphere of faith that you can walk on the what's it going to take you waiting for another tape to be found somewhere maybe a Bible verse that you ain't never had what's it going to take what you are listen what you are by the word right now is what you're going to be what's it going to take what has to happen to get our attention how bad does the storm got to get how big and how tall does the waves have to get how high does the waves got to get I don't want to offend you but I got to say this you can either sit in the boat or you can get out let me tell you what I see I see too many people hunkered down in the boat I'm just preaching to myself I'm just preaching about me a minute I see too many people that's hunkered down the boat they got a hold of the rail they got a hold of a broken ore they got a hold of the bottom of the floor and you listen how can you ever walk on the water if you don't stand up come on how can we really walk where we need to walk if we're so worried about the fear and the trouble and the waves and the problems and the circumstance how can we walk on the water if we're too busy hu her down the boat anybody listen anybody can come to church and sit on pews anybody can pack a Bible around anybody can put a picture on the wall anybody can carry message books but it takes somebody who is serious with God to stand up in that b and to go walking around it takes somebody that's got a real Revelation I'm talking about standing up in the middle of a test standing up in the middle of trouble standing up in the middle of sickness Lord if that be you B me to come on the water why listen to me why do we think that the safest place is in the bottom of the boat why is it why do we put more F faith in boats than we do Walking With Jesus it hits you strange don't it I'm challenging you I know why there are securities in the boat lots of Securities in this boat it's tangible I can put my hands on it I can put my feet on it I can feel it when you got your hands on it and you know when you left the shore this boat's got you this far but it ain't going to get you the rest of the way come on what happens is we put our faith we put more faith in material things than we do Walking With Jesus listen to me but our faith cannot be tested the way that God wants it to be tested hunker down the bottom of the boat had Peter been like everybody else this scripture wouldn't even be here in the Book of Matthew think about it had Peter been like everybody else we wouldn't even have this story but I want to tell you oh my here is Peter and something strikes him listen don't let the devil talk you in the staying in a sinking boat I don't think the safest place is the boat I think the safest place is with Christ I think the safest place is with Jesus the safest place ain't the both the safest place ain't your comfort zone it ain't Le on a sea it ain't the church the safest place is Walking With Jesus that's the safest place how many times do we get hunkered down that boat and about that time here comes a billow slaps the side of that boat you know what we do get a little bit bigger grip on that boat listen friends we got a lot of confidence in the boat the boat's been good for a long time and we get in there we got our heads down and we think oh my here comes another one and another one and another one but all you're doing is hanging on yeah and hope it stops but hope ain't going to get you out of here faith is you hear me Faith is many people hopes it's going to get better oh their hope is November 20124 give me a trump man ain't the hope I'm looking for it ain't that trump it is a trump but it just ain't that Trump our hope is not in government the prophet says the last vision of this nation it was in it was in atomic ashes don't put your hope in governments don't put your hope in politics put your hope in the only place and the safest place and that's walking with Jesus because governments a failure men will fail you preachers will failure but God Amen God will never fail you I'm just hoping it goes away hey man we need more than hope we need a faith to get up and to step out you know we do in the boat we got so much confidence in the boat can I preach this all right too late ain't it we start bailing water we start bailing water you know why saving this boat I'm in control you know what you're telling God I got this Lord let me bail some of the water out of this boat I think I can save myself I mean I think I can save this boat I got enough strength I got enough ability I got enough understanding I got enough engineering that I can save this soul I can save myself you can't save yourself I can't save myself you can't pray enough you can't fast enough you can't clean yourself up enough you've got to be able to have faith to walk with Jesus it's going to take more than your ability to save you amen if you don't get H of Jesus guess what going to be a whole boat full of dead men I said Jesus don't show up it's a bunch of dead men let me tell you why because there's more water coming in the boat than what's going out of the boat you see what I'm saying there's more trouble around us there's more things that's going on there's more water that's coming in than what we can get out of it's impossible to keep the boat afloat without faith it's impossible to take the Rapture without faith it's impossible to overcome this age without faith that's the reason I say Lord if that be you B me to come walk on the water the prophet tells us as he describes in great detail that the ores are broke the boats filling up with water the Sails are broke they can't sail their way out they can't listen they can't bail their way out and too many of the men is still sitting around hanging on that boat I say it's time for somebody to stand up I say it's time for the bride to stand up it's time for the body to start walking over some things that they used to sink in things that used to take them down and completely put them down the M it's time we start walking over that I don't care what it is if it's radio television family children spousal Problem whatever it is it's time we don't allow that to affect us but our eyes has got to be upon Christ and tell him Lord I'm walking over this the way you walked over drugs the way you walked over alcohol the way you walked over the world that's the way you can walk on this water you know what it's going to take you got to put something into action and you never can make that listen you can never make the first step until you stand up it's imperative listen to me tonight it's imperative it's an emergency we must get out of the boat if the sails Won't Sail and the ores won't if the ORS won't paddle and the storm's not going away there's only one answer stepping out of the boat that's right oh yeah amen prise Lord it was at this moment something Supernatural takes place it was at this moment that Peter now watch that Peter looks up and he sees something coming across the water I don't know how many saw it but I can tell you this at least one of them did see it now it may not have been as we would say the way the store starts because they think it's a spirit so there's fear listen the moment that Christ is coming that's when the most fear is coming against them and when Jesus sees Peter he's been oh something about Peter looks and he says who it is so Peter the one that's SS to walk he has a supernatural Enlightenment Amen to who's coming toward them so in the darkest time Peter had eyes to see in the dark come on somebody in when the waves are the greatest Peter seen who it was when the trouble is the greatest Peter seen who it was was his eyes come open actually he see he not only look but then he recognizes so he looks he recogniz now it's time to act are you hearing me let me just say this when he seen it was Jesus and he seen Jesus walking on the water something about what Peter saw done something inside of Peter something in Peter begin to awake Glory Glory GL something in him is moved to the sphere of faith that caused him to stand up and speak and I want to tell you this that's exactly where we are at right now do you hear me this is where this is in my honest opinion this is where we're at right now this is where we're at today our faith has been restored by the message of the hour it's in this day that God is calling the elected bride to a higher real of faith in what she's ever possessed before I'm not just talking about faith I'm talking about a perfect faith we cannot sit here and our keep our eyes on the ways come on somebody we can't sit here and keep our eyes on trouble he's letting us know Jesus is here there's a Christ that is Among Us the word is Among Us and it's [Applause] real everything that God promised us he would do he's done it this day our faith has come back our hearts has been turned back the word has been revealed the seals has come open the Mysteries has become real God has left us without excuse now it's time that faith of the word moves in and you've got to do your part amen what do I need to do let this faith that has been brought by the message of Malachi 4 let it move you into action so he's heard he's recognized and now something in Peter oh my when he sees Jesus and he looks and sees him he seen something I don't I can't really even understand it but there's something in him that when he sees that word he recognized his day and its message he recognized an authority that lays in the word that gives him a right when the waves got higher it moved Peter's Faith to a place of speech where he can say some things now I said that's where Christ is trying to be get the church to he's trying to move us to a place where you can ask anything in my name and it shall be it don't matter how impossible it looks it don't matter how big the waves are you want to walk on waves you can walk on you want to walk on cancer you can walk on you want to walk on Diabetes you can walk on it something about this moves Peter to a dimension of Faith to where Peter opens up his mouth and his faith says Lord if that be you the storm moved him to open his mouth and start speaking Yeah Lord help me to get a hold of it we need to get so fed up with bailing water we've got to get so fed up that it moves our faith into a place to where we can speak notice Peter didn't do listen when Peter says Lord if that be you the moment Peter's Faith reaches out and he sends that Faith out he sends those words out Jesus did not remain silent during the storm I said Jesus will not remain quiet in the middle of troublesome times the power of one word give this man The Authority the word give this man of authority to walk on water can you imagine the present tense word Christ the present tense word give this man a disciple of Christ an elect of God it give the elect the authority to walk on the water Jesus said well come right on Peter can you imagine Jesus hearing this from Peter Lord that be you been me can you imagine what this must have done to the heart of him when he sees this man in the middle of the great this dark trial that they're going through when just a moment ago there was so much hope you got enough ear to hear the voice tonight calling from the water come on young people come on Daddy come on sick I'm on depressed if you've been worried all you got to do is come right on the water's fine this is what I see this is just the way I see it I can see Peter stand up I don't believe the boat stopped moving I can see Peter stand up that boat's moving all around him I mean that thing's rocking back and forth but Peter not only has he seen not only has he heard but now there's a supernatural faith that is has elevated him and something in this man starts responding to the word his faith is elevating him to a realm of the supernatural listen that no other man in the scripture outside of Jesus has ever even done this why his faith took over his eyes his fith took over his emotions his fith took over his feelings his fith took over his thoughts his faith took over his mind he looked past the wave he looked past the wind he Pastor I'm preaching to he look past that's what faith does faith looks past all the it looks past all right it looks past CT and it looks to the Divine promise of God that says come on Peter come on walking on the [Applause] water this man's not even seeing waves he's not seeing the wind he's not seeing the trouble he's not seeing the turmoil a mortal man I see Peter stand up and about that time Beyond thought Beyond intellect Beyond any part of a man's mind simply by faith I can see Peter stick his foot over the edge of that boat sounds solid to me how about you I'm talking about just as solid as that floor is I can see as he takes his leg and say it feels like a board down there something feels like it's happening right here you know what I think I'm going to do I think I'm going to go ahead and get out of this boat and the first thing you got to do is you got to let go and when you let go you start walking out of the water I'm walking to where Jesus is I'm not stopping I'm not looking ways I'm not looking at troubles I got my eyes on that word and I ain't quitting till I get there I ain't stopping till I get there I'm walking on the water [Music] but you know what too many of us do my brother David but you don't know me you don't understand I know Jesus can do it but this is me I know the Bible says that Peter did it but this is me I'm sure brother Rand could do it but this is me brother Tom can do it but this is me if Peter would have thought that he would have never got out of the boat amen you know what you're saying let me interpret it for you what if I don't make the Rapture what if I'm not elect what if I'm not predestinated what if I'm not a child of God your faith must be anchored to the revelation of this hour it's beyond what you see it's beyond what you feel it's beyond what you think it's beyond your natural mind it's what the word says about you what scriptural evence does Peter have what quote can he take us back to huh oh he don't have none he ain't got one scriptural evidence of another man ever walking on water he didn't need evidence because in the present tense of the light the word it elevates his faith to a sphere where it does things man knows nothing about I can imagine the waves didn't stop trouble didn't stop you know what he did put his foot right over there when the wind won't stop the rain won't stop and the storm will stop listen there was no change in the Storm at all but they didn't need a change in the storm God needed a change in Peter take it home with you tonight we don't need a change in the world we don't need to put some preacher to bring some big rally to America you know what we need we need a change in America we need a change in our life a change in the way we see things said God could put Abraham Lincoln on every corner and he said wouldn't do no good Abraham Lincoln may not do it let me tell Billy gram or orl Roberts wouldn't do it but I'm want to tell you the word Christ Among Us it will change it may not change America but it change some Americans there was a change in Peter the word pulled this man to a higher Dimension yes it caused Peter to be raptured that's what I'm preaching to you did Peter walk on top of it so he was caught up or raptured up above it the word pulled him to a sphere his faith did it pulled him to the sphere where all things are possible to them that believe but if you're always looking at the senses and the feelings and the emotions and the sensitivity he has listen you must go beyond human ability it went it sent him to a dimension that I allowed him to do something outside the carnal mind can even think that's the people that's got the faith of Abraham they call those things which were not as though they were do you realize that's the same faith that Samson used to defeat a thousand Phil stones with the dry jaw bone of an ass that's the same faith that David used when he slung it at a giant one day it's that same Faith that's the faith that shamgar had when he went down there with the Oxo listen that is the authority that the bride needs it ain't some great big true huge Revelation it's who you are in Christ and recognizing who he is recognizing who you are and then acting on what it is circumstances don't matter the odds don't matter no matter how outnumbered they was it doesn't matter the size of the giant it don't matter how hot the fire is that's not what we're looking at Faith looks at the word not circumstance not symptoms it looks to the promise of God listen don't don't worry about that just like the thing we read the other day don't tell your storm don't tell your God how big your storm is tell your storm how big your God is how you looking at it tell that storm that your God to a water walking God tell your storm your God walks through the fire tell your God that tell your storm that your God has the ability to do abundantly more than you can ask or think I guarantee you when Peter stood up in that boat he got the attention of everybody in that boat they may think the same thing about you but I don't care I said I don't care people watching you stand up in the boat who cares well what's people going to say I don't care what they say what's people going to think if they see you standing up in the boat I don't care what they think you confess you're a Believer you say you're solded out you say you're anchored to people's going to watch you they're going to watch your life they're going to watch what you wear they're going to watch what you do go ahead go ahead and keep right on watching they may call you a fanatic they may call you a manfa but what they didn't hear they didn't hear the word that you heard that said come on out [Applause] here well you ought to be used to getting looked at strange but now come on that's the way you're denomination looked at you when you walked out their doors that's why the that's why your friends looked at you when you told them you were serving God and now you're a Christ follower amen when you tell them you're getting out of this boat they're going to look at you strange even people around our message well look at you strange well who do you think you are anyway what do you think you're doing what do you think you do coming around our church telling people to step out of the boat listen friends God's been building this kind of a church year in and year out this is the kind of people that God wants and this is the kind of people he's going to have and I'm afraid that's where people is missing that we know quotes we know scriptures we know seals we know Thunders we know pools but let me tell we know all about mechanics but do we got enough M Faith do we got enough Dynamics to make the mechanics move what good does it do to have a perfect car if you ain't got no Dynamics to make that car move yall they're going to talk about you yeah they're going to look down on you but they didn't hear you hear word when Jesus said come right on you know what I wonder I wonder if people has really apprehended God or have they just block Baptist boats for message boats or Pentecostal boats for message boats Catholic boat for a message boat Peter puts his foot out that boat bobbing back and forth he didn't try to figure it all out he didn't try to get into the Alder this thing see pleas minus three x pyx this and uhuh Faith went beyond every bit of that he never the prophet tells us in perfect Faith he never even thought when are we going to stop trying to figure out how the Rapture is going to come how the body change is going to work and all kinds of ideas to it listen simply believe Lord I don't know when you're going to do it I don't know exactly how you're going to do all of it but I want to make sure when you find me I'm not hunker down the boat somewhere you're going to find me walking on the water how can God do that how can God heal us Deliver Us how in the world can God meet our need if we're trying to figure it out on our own don't you realize Jesus had already told these men where I am may you be also you hear that tonight what you got to do Peter take him at his word get out of the boat and God will take care of the rest of it and for a few moments something about the word elevates this man to where he's walking on this water but the moment he started getting his eyes on waves troubles problems everything I'm preaching governments politicians politics votes elections structure around work politics around your job that's when you start sinking down there is a walk of faith that we can possess stand our feet tonight as we bow our hearts Hallelujah there's a walk of faith that you can possess tonight I believe there's a realm where we can walk in where all things are possible we cannot sit still friends listen to me you cannot sit still and hope that somebody else gets up and walks on the water for you you must take the initiative as an individual yourself Young person you got to take the initiative for yourself say Lord if you're going to send a Revival I want you to start right here with me Lord Lord you going to send the fire you going to send the anointing I want you to start right here I'm not looking around I'm not asking anybody Lord I want you to start right here and let me tell you when you get out of the boat your battle isn't over just because you walk don't mean the trouble's over and the wavs are going to start oh no but if you keep your eyes on the promise you'll finally come in Jesus I get a hold of you oh God help us tonight Hallelujah think about this quote where says faith is the substance of things hop for the evidence of things you don't see taste feel smell or hear but when faith when he catches the word it sends him into a dimension that makes it so real to him till it's just as good as he's got it in his hand he knows it's going to happen hallelujah hallelujah oh thank you Lord Jesus Jesus Lord God with our heads bowed to this earth Lord this message that I speak on tonight this really ain't even a message Lord for a church this is a message for individuals and I pray tonight Lord start with me Lord God we don't want to sink we don't want to be like the rest of the world we don't want to be groped in fear we want our faith to be elevated to the place place where we can step out of the boat Lord Jesus we've heard so much of the word dear God what what else would you have to give us you've done everything that you promised to do and now Lord it turns and the responsibility falls upon your people it's time that we start walking on the water oh Jesus Lord God I pray tonight Lord don't start with somebody in my church I pray Lord that you would start with me Lord begin this revival begin this fire we know Lord the prophet tells us that fire is attractive that if you get around somebody on fire eventually you'll get on Fire Lord that's the way I want to be help me Lord I don't want to be an ember I want to be on Fire Lord oh Jesus we don't want to be cold we don't want to be lukewarm we want to be on fire tonight Lord God I believe that you're calling your people Lord as we listen to the message of perfect faith and we hear what your Prophet is telling us lord it's not just the faith we know there's a faith that's given to every man Lord but I don't want just common faith I want a perfect Faith tonight I want to be able to walk over I don't want to sink Lord I want to walk over it help us I pray Lord each one that is in this place I pray in the name of Jesus May you search every heart that is here tonight Lord I pray Lord that you would look within them Lord what's it going to take Lord what would you have to do to be able to take Lord and and and spur somebody into that place Lord to where they're lit and they're Quicken to try to step out Lord God whatever it is tonight I pray Lord may you move deep down within our souls tonight I pray God may this word set a fire underneath us that if nobody else is going to do it I'm going to do it if nobody else is going to go I'm going to go if ain't nobody else going to make it I'm going to make it myself I've got to I can't miss it oh God set us a flame tonight each one I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everybody said Amen brother sing that song you
